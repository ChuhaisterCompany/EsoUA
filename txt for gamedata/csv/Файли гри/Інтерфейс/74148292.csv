"74148292-0-405";"Some Antiquities are fragmented into multiple parts.\n\nEach fragment of an Antiquity will have its own Lore Entry, and will require its own Lead. For all intents and purposes, even just a scrap of that forgotten object is an Antiquity unto itself.\n\nOnce you've found all of the fragments of an Antiquity, they will automatically combine to create the final Antiquity."
"74148292-0-407";"Antiquities are only available to players who have access to the Greymoor Chapter. Players who do not have access to the Greymoor Chapter can discover Leads for Antiquities, but can't join the Antiquarian Circle—and thus, they cannot Scry for or excavate those Antiquities. Players who finished the Antiquarian tutorial and who lose access to this Chapter retain ownership of the Antiquarian's Eye collectible, retains progress in Antiquities skill lines and Leads, but cannot Scry.\n\nTo begin your journey as an Antiquarian, you'll need to visit the Antiquarian Circle, found in Solitude, in Western Skyrim. There, you'll find Verita Numida, who will start you on your path."
"74148292-0-408";"When Scrying for an Antiquity with the Antiquarian's Eye, you begin at the large crystal in the bottom-middle. This crystal indicates how many turns you have remaining. When the crystal is totally depleted, your Scrying session ends.\n\nYour goal is to claim the glowing Foci scattered across the lens. Every Foci you claim eliminates one possible Dig Site from your map, narrowing and expediting your search. You must acquire at least one Foci to begin searching for the Antiquity.\n\nTo move toward the Foci, select a facet adjacent to your area of control. This will add that facet—and all facets of the same type that touch it—to your owned area. In this way, you can claim more and more facets as you Scry.\n\nIf you don't acquire all the Foci, you can return to the Codex and Scry for the same Antiquity again. There is no cost associated with trying again, and obtaining more Foci the second time will narrow down the Antiquity's possible locations."
"74148292-0-409";"Once you've found a suspicious pile of dirt, interact with it.\n\nIf it is not the Antiquity's actual location, you'll find some simple Treasure, and that Dig Site will disappear from your map. This means the Antiquity is resting in some other location.\n\nIf a dirt pile does contain the Antiquity, you will enter the Excavation phase of your journey."
"74148292-0-410";"The first phase of an Excavation involves locating the Antiquity's location within the dirt, using the Antiquarian's Eye to Augur for it. When you Augur, the chunk of dirt you select will light up. The brighter and greener the light, the closer that chuck is to the Antiquity, with brilliant green indicating the Antiquity's exact location.\n\nOnce you've located the Antiquity, you'll need to uncover it, using your Hand Brush. In lower-difficulty Excavations, the Hand Brush alone can uncover the sought Antiquity. More challenging Excavations, however, require the use of other tools, which you can unlock by leveling up the Antiquarian Skill Line."
"74148292-0-411";"As you advance the Excavation Skill Line, you'll unlock additional tools to aid you in your digging efforts. Both of these tools require you to build up Intuition by using the Hand Brush, and both depend on the elevation of the chunks surrounding where you use them, so be sure to plan your moves carefully.\n\nThe Trowel allows you to dig deeply, removing several layers of dirt and rock from a single chunk of the Excavation site. Once upgraded, it can safely trigger Fissures, allowing you to control their detonation, and even chain their explosions together!\n\nThe Heavy Shovel can remove a large area of dirt in a single action. It only affects adjacent chunks of the same height as the chunk you select. Use Heavy Shovel to flatten an area quickly, or to remove huge amounts of soil in a hurry. Once upgraded, you have a chance to not consume any Intuition when you use the Heavy Shovel."
"74148292-0-413";"There are 4 types of indicators:\n• A faint red outline with no glow: indicates that the Antiquity is at least five chunks of dirt away.\n• An orange outline with a subtle glow: indicates that the Antiquity is 3-4 chunks of dirt away.\n• A yellow outline with a strong glow: indicates the Antiquity is nearby, 1-2 chunks of dirt away.\n• Finally, a bright green outline with a strong, pulsating glow: indicates the Antiquity is directly beneath the Augured chunk.\n\nYou can only use your Augur skill a limited number of times during an Excavation. However, using the Augur skill does not consume your limited number of turns for the Excavation, so don't be afraid to use this important skill to give yourself an edge.\n\nFinally, keep in mind: at first, your Augur skill can only detect the Antiquity starting from the lowest, darkest layers of dirt in an Excavation. Once upgraded, it can detect the Antiquity through the middle and lowest layers. This means you may need to remove some dirt before you can successfully Augur for the Antiquity."
"74148292-0-414";"If an upgraded Trowel is used to expose a Fissure, it will not deal damage to the Antiquity. Furthermore, if two Fissures can be connected by a path of dirt and rocks that are at exactly the same height, exposing the Fissure will cause an explosive chain reaction! Every chunk between the two Fissures will be destroyed, allowing you to remove huge amounts of dirt in one fell swoop.\n\nHowever, be warned: if the path between two exploding Fissures crosses directly over any part of the Antiquity, the Antiquity will be completely destroyed—instantly ending the Excavation in failure."
