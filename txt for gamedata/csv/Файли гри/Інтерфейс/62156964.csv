This list displays all of the Antiquities you can currently search for. Select an Antiquity from this list to begin Scrying. Remember that you can only Scry for Antiquities found in the zone you're currently standing in!\n\nThe remaining entries in the Codex list Antiquities by zone. This list allows you to see what Antiquities you've found, how many times you've found them, and any Lore Entries you've uncovered for those Antiquities.\n\nEvery Antiquity has at least one Lore Entry associated with it. You'll uncover a Lore Entry by successfully excavating that Antiquity. Some Antiquities have more than one Lore Entry; in that case, you'll uncover a new Entry every time you successfully excavate it, until you've found them all."
"62156964-0-406";"When you first begin your journey as an Antiquarian, your Antiquities Codex will appear rather sparse. This is because the majority of Antiquities are hidden!\n\nIn order to learn about the existence of these undiscovered Antiquities, you'll need to uncover Leads. Most Antiquities require you to find a Lead before you can Scry for them.\n\nExcavating a hidden Antiquity consumes its Lead, so you'll need to find another Lead to Scry for that Antiquity again. However, your Codex will retain all the details you've learned about that Antiquity so far.\n\nYou can find Leads all over Tamriel and beyond. Try speaking with merchants, exploring the world, searching for treasure chests, slaying Bosses, fishing, stealing …. Antiquity Leads can pop up almost anywhere!\n\nOne final note: Leads will expire after a long period of time, so be sure to track down hidden Antiquities in a timely fashion!"
"62156964-0-407";"Antiquities are historical treasures hidden all over Tamriel and beyond, just waiting for you to learn about them. The Antiquities system allows you to search for these lost, forgotten, and valuable objects—to catalog them, learn about their lore, and to reap the incredible rewards."
"62156964-0-408";"The first step in uncovering an Antiquity is Scrying for it. Gazing into the Antiquarian's Eye will allow you to expand your awareness and mystically search for these hidden treasures.\n\nIn order to Scry for an Antiquity, you must be in the same Zone as the Antiquity, and you must have a relevant Lead (if the Antiquity requires it).\n\nTo begin Scrying, open your Codex and select the Antiquity you wish to Scry for from the Scryable list. (If the Antiquity does not appear on that list, you cannot Scry for it.) Once you've made your selection, you'll be taken to a view of the Antiquarian's Eye."
"62156964-0-409";"Once you successfully Scry for an Antiquity, you'll need to venture out into the world in order to find it.\n\nTo begin with, open your Zone Map. The map will display a number of ""Dig Sites."" Only one of these Dig Sites contain the Antiquity. The more Foci you obtain while Scrying, the fewer Dig Sites will appear on the map—down to just one, if you claimed all the Foci.\n\nOnce you venture to a Dig Site, your compass will glow, much like a Quest step that requires you to search the area. In much the same way, you'll need to investigate your surroundings to find the Antiquity's resting place.\n\nYou can use the Antiquarian's Eye from your Quickslot, or from your Collections menu, to point the way toward the nearest possible location for the Antiquity. However, you can only call on the Antiquarian's Eye in this way every so often, so be sure to look around while you search.\n\nThe visible cue you're looking for is a mound of dirt with subtle sparkles floating upwards from it. The dirt may match the terrain's coloration, so keep a sharp eye out. Purchasing the Keen Eye passive may help you spot these dirt mounds more quickly."
"62156964-0-410";"The last step in acquiring an Antiquity is Excavation. During an Excavation, you work to remove the Antiquity from the dirt, without breaking it, and within the time allotted.\n\nTo begin an Excavation, you must first Scry for the Antiquity, and then locate its exact burial spot within its Dig Site. Once you interact with the Antiquity's dirt mound, the Excavation begins.\n\nYou have a limited number of actions you can take during an Excavation, indicated by the Intuition meter at the top of the screen, and by the daylight remaining. When you've used up your limited actions, the dig is over.\n\nIf you fail to Excavate an Antiquity (whether by breaking it, or by running out of turns), the Dig Site will disappear. Don't worry, though. You can find it again, somewhere within the same Dig Site on your map."
"62156964-0-411";"Attempting to excavate more difficult Antiquities often leads to new challenges.\n\nFirst, you will find that many Antiquities are buried near additional items, known as Bonus Loot. These rewards—while not as valuable as an Antiquity—still provide added benefit to your Excavation.\n\nAfter you excavate an Antiquity, you can continue to dig for any Bonus Loot still hidden in the dirt. Note, however, that the Augur skill does not reveal Bonus Loot, and you can only keep Bonus Loot if you successfully excavate the Antiquity.\n\nYou may also stumble upon Fissures; these small pockets of volatile gas often appear near rarer Antiquities. Removing the last chunk of dirt from a fissure will trigger a detonation, damaging the Antiquity. Upgrading the Trowel can turn these explosions to your benefit by removing large amounts of dirt in a single action. But be wary—these explosions can break an Antiquity and end your excavation in an instant."

There are four general types of vendors that sell furnishings: Achievement, Home Goods, Luxury, and Master Writ. \n\nEach zone will have an Achievement vendor and a Home Goods vendor.

You can purchase their furnishings for gold, and their offerings will not rotate. \n\nYou can purchase an Achievement vendor's wares only after completing specific achievements or completing an antiquities codex entry.

"62156964-0-573";"Homes come in many styles, sizes, and shapes. The location of the house determines several of these factors. Most homes match the style of the zone they're in, but this isn't always the case. It's always worth previewing a home to see how it looks and feels before you decide to purchase. \n\nThe size of a home determines how many furnishings a player can place within it. There are three general house sizes: Staple, Classic, and Notable. As the house size increases, so does the furnishing limits. You can find these limits in the housing editor when browsing your furnishings. These limits are doubled for ESO Plus members. \n\nOnce you own a home, you can teleport to the inside or outside of the home free of cost, so pay attention to the location when purchasing a home since it might help you get around quickly and cheaply."
