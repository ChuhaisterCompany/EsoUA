"116521668-0-62";"You've retrieved the crates, I trust? The Red Rook bandits are not to be trifled with - and their leader is a lunatic. \n\nI'm glad to see you returned safely, with my merchandise. You've saved many travelers, my friend."
"116521668-0-72";"You would like to speak to Countess Virolynn?  Should I allow any vagrant to bother the Countess?\n\nCome back tomorrow."
"116521668-0-84";"I am pleased to see you alive and well, your travels have been quite dangerous as I have heard.\n\nOur mystery will soon conclude, yet I fear what we are going to uncover by finding the murderer will endanger us all..."
"116521668-0-86";"Vincintian sent you to me? Well. I suppose we must all make due with what we have."
"116521668-0-87";"Welcome back to Aldcroft, my friend."
"116521668-0-107";"It seems fewer people than I'd hoped know of our cause. We have a lot of work to do to spread the word. It heartens me to know that those who know of our cause are mostly supportive, though."
"116521668-0-113";"I think we can spare the men for that. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
"116521668-0-123";"Yes, I am Oron Nassir, investigator for the Fahara'jad, ruler of the Nine Crowns. Although the missive is a bit late, I could use your help..."
"116521668-0-155";"Welcome back to Aldcroft.  There was no pause to our werewolf troubles.  Perhaps the Magis Order will track down your Chamberlain's associates and halt this war."
"116521668-0-159";"I see my husband is safe... I worried greatly for him with the wound he took to his leg. We are all safe now, thanks in no small part to your efforts. Please, take this as a gesture of our gratitude."
"116521668-0-184";"Very good. Give me a moment to triangulate thier location based on the information you have provided me."
"116521668-0-196";"This is grave news, but will stop us finding the weapon. Before his unclean spirit departs fully from this world, I think we can get the information we seek from it.\n\nFirst, let me reward you for your efforts."
"116521668-0-215";"Thank you for helping return my men. Here is a token of my graditude."
"116521668-0-231";"You have seen but a glimpse of the Veil, but you've returned to us mostly unharmed. That alone is an accomplishment most cannot speak of.\n\nI apologize for the suddenness of that. We had to test you to see if your body would withstand the entering."
"116521668-0-232";"One final word of advice... hero. \n\nFor every statue you strike, it will cry out as if a living, breathing creature. Any who are near will rush to it's aid, attempting to stop its destruction. \n\nRemember this, though I doubt it help.\n\nSly is waiting."
"116521668-0-247";"It brings me joy to hear the traitor is dead. I must remain at Virolynn's side, but you should go north to the town of Crosswych in Dwynnen to see if they can shed any light on the Shrouded Throne. See Warden Godwin, he is a good and loyal man."
"116521668-0-253";"Brennoc sent you to me, did he?  Good, I may have use of you..."
"116521668-0-275";"With this Chalice, and the power in the Soulstone of Brall, I believe my invocations may at last reach Ranser's spirit, wherever it may be. I must prepare myself. You should as well. When you feel ready, return to me and we shall begin."
"116521668-0-284";"Our true enemy has revealed himself - some thrall of the Daedra, no doubt. I am unhurt, but his spells weakened me. Ranser's body is gone! \n\nWorse, the ritual has gone awry - angry spirits roam Camlorn, and I am too weak to face them alone!"
"116521668-0-295";"They chose to desecrate the Direnni, this was their lot. Perhaps now they'll leave it be.  As thanks, let me fuse the souls harvested in Crystalwan with an item you may find useful..."
"116521668-0-305";"My soldiers are stalwart, yet the enemy is formidable, guided by unseen hands."
"116521668-0-306";"My soldiers fight with renewed vigor - you have turned the tide, champion. Thanks to you, we will hold the Redoubt - no matter the cost! Your efforts have saved Camlorn."
"116521668-0-318";"Well done. The lake will be cleansed in a matter of days - my alchemy is beyond reproach. We have worked well together."
"116521668-0-340";"The dead will rest peacefully, thanks to you. We Gravebinders thank you for your help."
"116521668-0-345";"It is clear to me that we are in over our heads. I urge you to flee, hero, unless you can bring enough force to bear to take on that monster in its own lair."
"116521668-0-523";"Destroying those Undead Knights will help out greatly."
"116521668-0-543";"It's all here!  I was worried all of the research we completed would be lost.  The death that happened here won't be in vain."
"116521668-0-544";"Your deeds are not going unnoticed.  You have been a brave soul to battle this evil."
"116521668-0-556";"Well met, noble Numinous! May Xarxes, God of Ancestry and Secrets, commemorate you! In this hour the Altmer need your aid."
"116521668-0-557";"You've made me soo happy! Thank you so much for finding him."
"116521668-0-569";"HAHAHHA!!  You've made a wise decision.  As promised, here's your reward.  I hope you enjoy it.... MWHAHAH"
"116521668-0-570";"Praise the Divines!  You've returned... and with the tome! I can feel its magic! You have my eternal graditude adventurer - I promise to use this to cure all of Tamriel's ills."
"116521668-0-575";"Thanks to your help, we have vanquished the major threat coming from within the keep and will surely win this fight after all."
"116521668-0-576";"So my fears were true. Well, you did your best. Thank you for finding my men, I will let thier families know that they died defending our lands."
"116521668-0-577";"Yes! This is exactly the component I've been needing. Thank you."
"116521668-0-580";"You've done it. I heard his pleas from here. Now, he troubles no one. Let us away from this place, and let the Dark Brotherhood's name become the stuff of nightmares for those who would follow Blackmoore's path."
"116521668-0-582";"His Captain of the Guard was a werewolf? I knew Blackmoore was brazen, but that goes farther than I thought even he dared. Good work. Should anyone try to make the Baron seem a victim, this information will remove any question of his guilt."
"116521668-0-583";"That monster practiced necromancy? The Baron's death is more than just a boon for us - the Nine would smile on even us for our actions today. Rest easy tonight, for you have done work that even priests would approve of."
"116521668-0-632";"Sir Hughes may live, but he will never stand in my court again. \n\nI hereby strip him of his knighthood. I exile him from Alcaire. He may never return, upon penalty of death. He faces a kinder fate than the one that befell my wife."
"116521668-0-676";"Is that so? \n\nHunh. We'll see. Tell you what: I've got a task that needs doing, but it might get ugly. Take care of it for me, and you're in."
"116521668-0-708";"A Duskstone? Fascinating. I've heard of them but never seen one. It's said that Azura once used a Duskstone to break the barrier between day and night.\n\nMaybe it can also penetrate the barrier between waking and sleeping."
"116521668-0-711";"We were in pain. Your kindness saved us from a tormented existence.\n\nI sent my husband to Camp Tamrith. If you happen to meet him, tell him what happened here. Tell him not to return. Let Crestshade be forgotten."
"116521668-0-769";"Bah! Are you always so damn noble? You need to lighten up, my friend. \n\nPerhaps this will lighten your spirits. It's a small token of my appreciation, but one I hope will serve you as you have served me. You're a hero … and now, a friend too."
"116521668-0-818";"I did? That's worse than I thought then. I had absolutely no control over myself whatsoever … or was that even me?\n\nI'm sorry. I'm not used to being … compromised like this. But that only doubles my debt to you."
"116521668-0-877";"<Fadeel hesitates for a moment and then turns to go.>"
"116521668-0-934";"As you can see, your deeds  precede you. The Kinlords and Kinladies sent Emissaries to pledge their support.\n\nIt has not been easy for me to steer this course. I am grateful for all you have done on my behalf, <<1>>."
"116521668-0-935";"As you can see, your deeds  precede you. The Kinlords and Kinladies sent Emissaries to pledge their support.\n\nIt has not been easy for me to steer this course. I am grateful for all you have done on my behalf, <<1>>."
"116521668-0-936";"As you can see, your deeds  precede you. The Kinlords and Kinladies sent Emissaries to pledge their support.\n\nIt has not been easy for me to steer this course. I am grateful for all you have done on my behalf, <<1>>."
"116521668-0-961";"I'm just hoping there was only one ship that crashed on the rocks. \n\nI could lose my job over this. If anyone asks, I hope you'll tell them it wasn't my fault."
"116521668-0-963";"As I thought... the Blight did not spare our brethren at the fort.\n\nAs for you, I see you have returned uninfected. I know not what magic keeps you free of the Blight, but you have proven your claim of immunity."
"116521668-0-969";"Indeed. Taking up arms against our fellow knights is something I know none of us wishes to do, but Sir Croix has forced this upon us.\n\nThis is unpleasant business, but let's get on with it."
"116521668-0-970";"Indeed. With Sir Croix slain, I am assuming command of Firebrand Keep for now.\n\nNeedless to say, preparations to march to Alcaire Castle have been called off."
"116521668-0-1263";"Yes, and I share her concerns about both Camlorn and Aldcroft. We must deal with these werewolves once and for all. \n\nIn fact, I hope to involve you in that."
"116521668-0-1264";"That irascible cad! I should have known better than to trust a common thief. Double, he says! It seems obvious to me now that he and his Red Rooks have absolutely no intention of dealing in good faith.\n\nIt's time to take a different tack."
"116521668-0-1380";"What fine samples of the herb these are!  It's amazing what will flourish in times of adversity, is it not?  \n\nThank you so much for these."
"116521668-0-1418";"Great work tracking down the spy! If he had managed to report it could have put my men in serious jeopardy."
"116521668-0-1599";"That stubborn fool! At least Normar has finally found proof for his wild claims of necromancy."
"116521668-0-1607";"Praise Vivec! Thank you for releasing me. I'll run right to him and explain.\n\nBy the way, I have an amazing idea for a spell that makes everyone else around you smell better. It will change everything!"
"116521668-0-1660";"Aha! Good work! Generations of orcs will admire what you've helped create.\n\nI've heard more good news as well. General Godrun said there's another battle coming. Bring it on, I say!"
"116521668-0-1665";"I-I don't know. When he heard the cavern collapse, he declared 'mission accomplished' for the Ironhand Ogres. \n\nBut then he ordered me to muster the troops and prepare to march on Wayrest!"
"116521668-0-1711";"This is good. Relieves Dro-Dara greatly. Many years we traveled together and many years we worked to make this plantation profitable. \n\nDro-Dara can abandon plantation. Good friends, he cannot."
"116521668-0-1712";"Oh Breloth, my love! Do you see what we have for you? She would've loved this.\n\nFlowers, wine, food … everything will be perfect."
"116521668-0-1718";"We all owe you a debt of gratitude for freeing us. \n\nWe'll be safe for a while, but life won't really return to normal until someone drives out those mercenaries."
"116521668-0-1771";"Ha! There won't be an 'attack.' I don't have the soldiers to spare.\n\nAbbot Durak says you're a champion though, and I trust him. I believe you can do this on your own."
"116521668-0-1818";"That's good, very good. Not such a rotting waste now, are ya? I promised you gold and here it is."
"116521668-0-1828";"I'm not hurt, but I'd be dead without you. The dreugh were keeping us for food and feeding us to their young!\n\nThe little ones would gnaw through the mud and … it doesn't matter now. I'm going to find whoever's responsible for this."
"116521668-0-1833";"Thank the Three! All three of them! This wine is perfect for selling. To other people.\n\nYou are my new and bestest friend. If you ever have need of wine, remember my name—Drothan. The Winemaster."
"116521668-0-1873";"I knew you'd understand. Soon, the dreugh will clear these lowlifes out. Then I'll have my land back.\n\nHere, this ought to cover your trouble. As for Charnis, I'll deal with him."
"116521668-0-1874";"I suspected Baron Sorick from the start. Come, let's be on our way. Best we don't know too much about what happens next."
"116521668-0-1876";"He's still under a sleep spell.\n\nBut I've learned something. The Midnight Union wanted us to panic. The attack, the fires … they were just a diversion. While we were distracted, they entered the abbey and stole the Dream Shard."
"116521668-0-1887";"Thanks for pitching in. I think we've saved enough crops to make it through the winter.\n\nBut why did this happen? What's it all about?"
"116521668-0-1895";"You saw my dream. Clearly Vaermina's cult, the Supernal Dreamers, is behind this betrayal by the Midnight Union.\n\nThe outlaws of the Union took the Dream Shard, but I fear it's for Vaermina's evil purposes. We must recover it."
"116521668-0-1919";"Well done, and thanks for all the help!\n\nEr … the commander, here, would like to have a word with you."
"116521668-0-1930";"You found them!"
"116521668-0-1935";"Well done! You accomplished what we couldn't. Cumberland's Watch is in your debt.\n\nWe'll drive out the remaining Goblins. But while we're doing that, Rama's just going to be getting farther away."
"116521668-0-1966";"Thank you for asking. I'm feeling better already. It's certainly a relief to know the other Wardens are safe.\n\nI'll be able to get back to the abbey soon. Perhaps I'll see you there."
"116521668-0-1968";"Now that you've removed the <<1>>, the Stone Chewer Goblins will retrieve the <<2>> and return to their cave."
"116521668-0-1996";"Sure enough. This looks like my cousin's writing. He was supposed to return yesterday.\n\nThank you. I know you didn't have to do this. I … I'm going to need some time to think about this."
"116521668-0-2017";"Not yet. But you've brought us a great victory. Vaermina's immediate threat has been foiled.\n\nAnd now, we'd like you to have this. The other wardens and I infused our power into a mighty weapon to aid you in your fight."
"116521668-0-2023";"Regardless, I owe you one. \n\nThat was something wasn't it? The fires, the slavers running everywhere, getting all the guys free … quite an adventure. Hope I see you again, friend."
"116521668-0-2025";"The general? If the Omen were to get a hold of him, that would be very bad. \n\nBefore we act, we must be sure though. For now, we keep an eye on Godrun. Perhaps helping him defeat the Ogres will flush the Omen out."
"116521668-0-2070";"Then I am indebted to you, stranger. That nightmare—I thought I would be stuck there forever."
"116521668-0-2086";"Thank you. At least now, travelers won't be fooled into thinking they can trust these ruffians.\n\nAfter we get healed up, we'll make another push to drive the bandits from this region altogether."
"116521668-0-2114";"Well, I'm glad you decided to do so today. You will always, always be welcome at the Vanne farm.\n\nStay as long as you like."
"116521668-0-2148";"NEVER SEE"
"116521668-0-2151";"The honor of the Knights of the Flame has been restored, and Lakana's murderer is dead. However, nothing can bring my wife back."
"116521668-0-2152";"I am sorry to hear about the duchess. She was a good woman. \n\nThe ""Omen of Fear,"" you say? I recollect hearing something about such Daedra before. You should ask Abbot Durak—he would know."
"116521668-0-2171";"Excellent work! Thanks to you, the miners' deaths have been avenged. Here's some coin as promised."
"116521668-0-2184";"Ah, my spellbook! Excellent.\n\nIf you're hungry later, come back. I have a delightful recipe for roast chicken."
"116521668-0-2241";"Pheww, you stink like dead wolfman."
"116521668-0-2279";"I saw your mad box clicking skills, player. You're a demon with the right mouse button."
"116521668-0-2476";"Wh … what? How do you know this?\n\nThe wind is truly at our backs! I've misjudged you. My apologies."
"116521668-0-2522";"While I was fighting my way in, the cultists performed a ritual on Muzgu. He's partially possessed by a Daedric spirit!\n\nHe's stuck in a terrible dilemma. He insists I should return alone to Pariah Abbey, but I can't just leave him!"
"116521668-0-2524";"It is not an honorable death, but these Supernal Dreamers have shown no honor. Perhaps it is fitting one have the meeting with his mistress so many crave.\n\nWhen trapped in nightmare eternal, the cultist may regret their choice."
"116521668-0-2550";"Mara willing, that will calm the blasted things down.\n\nOf course, there's still the matter of who brought the dreugh eggs here in the first place."
"116521668-0-2643";"Ah, so you do know who I am then? Did my father put you up to this? Has he been watching me?\n\nWell … I shouldn't be so accusatory. If he was tracking me, then I guess it turned out to be extremely fortunate."
"116521668-0-2650";"Damn it all! Thoda said Suturah's sons were dangerous. That's certainly true now. With the Ansei Wards, they can raise an army faster than I can!\n\nWe have to stop them. We have to send Uwafa and Alasan to join their father in Oblivion!"
"116521668-0-2685";"Mauloch's nethers, it sure will feel good to be myself again.\n\nLast time I ever do business with a Baandari!"
"116521668-0-2718";"Very soon. It is like Tu'whacca is taking in the air and preparing to send his Breath.\n\nThe Withered Hand here will soon crumble, and the particles will drift away like sand in the wind."
"116521668-0-2721";"Then you've fulfilled the duty of the Ash'abah here, and saved me a dungheap of trouble.\n\nAs we Ash'abah always say, true honor need not be named. I hope we cross paths again."
"116521668-0-2726";"Tu'whacca says you should not worry. He says you will find them. I can watch over The Ward of Ansei Radan for now. \n\nTu'whacca has much faith in you, my friend. He wants me to give you this. You should be honored."
"116521668-0-2727";"You did? Hm. It has occurred to me that the Withered Hand might seek to use the wards to raise the consecrated dead at Tu'whacca's Throne. \n\nI am relieved that you stopped them."
"116521668-0-2764";"Another sibling? But who could that be? Wait, Suturah did have another child. A very young daughter. \n\nI remember her now, nipping at her brothers' heels. But her name escapes me. Still, somehow we must find her."
"116521668-0-2785";"Shiri? I do not know this name. Nor do I know anything about any Ansei Ward. I know only that Satakal will soon devour himself—devour us all!\n\nWe must warn them … or must we? No. It matters not."
"116521668-0-2915";"Yes, and I am grateful for that. You deserve a reward, wayfarer, not me. \n\nI will keep them safe now until we get to a town. Then I will return their money and go on my way."
"116521668-0-2929";"The greatest lesson of HoonDing's Watch is this: wars are fleeting, but honor is eternal. The dunes of time are ever shifting. Kings rise and fall, cities are razed and rebuilt, alliances are forged and broken. But honor, glory … legend remains."
"116521668-0-2988";"The leaders of the Withered Hand? But that would mean … Shiri is one of them too? A necromancer?\n\nYou think … tears of Zeht! With that text … and we have no idea where she is!"
"116521668-0-2989";"It was a tunnel? Huh. Does that mean they were coming from Bangkorai?  \n\nI guess that's a concern for another time. I'm damn glad you collapsed the tunnel though. I guess that's a good day's work for all of us!"
"116521668-0-2993";"The king has waited too long. So many warriors have died, and Marimah holds onto life by a thread.\n\nWe will answer the king's call to the best of our ability, but I fear we can do very little. You should speak to Talia if you haven't already."
"116521668-0-3023";"<You've taken the money. Donel Fontbonne will never know what his father left him.>"
"116521668-0-3037";"Whatever your motives, if not for you, I would never have survived. I owe you my life. Please, accept this reward."
"116521668-0-3038";"Excellent. I'll hold onto the jewels in case the potion doesn't work. We might have to pay the ransom. \n\nNow, here's a reward. There's more where that came from if you'll help with the rest of my plan."
"116521668-0-3050";"<It was too late to save Miranda. Serge's plot to kill her was a success.>"
"116521668-0-3055";"You're right. I'm sorry. I know it's wrong to blame you for what happened.\n\nWhy didn't he listen to me? The sacrifice would have worked. He didn't have to die.\n\nI'm not fit to be a Spirit Warden. I think I'm going to be a wanderer … like you."
"116521668-0-3056";"The Daedra is no more. I owe my life to you.\n\nYou'll still have to fight your way out, but once I'm confident no trace of the Daedra remains, Gerard and I will disperse the cultists and return to Pariah Abbey."
"116521668-0-3064";"What do you want me to say? \n\nI'll give them their land back and compensate them for this … minor inconvenience. After that, I'm leaving! I refuse to live in the mud. Emeric can find a swineherd to rule his pen of pigs."
"116521668-0-3075";"Yes. S'rashi is very relieved and boss will be happy.\n\nYou are a better enforcer than my brother ever was. From now on, I will think of you as family. What is mine is also yours."
"116521668-0-3084";"That's fantastic. The Backstreet Gang will scatter to the wind without the Grinder to hold them together. \n\nYou just made my job so much easier. I guess you made Wayrest safer too. Take care, friend."
"116521668-0-3095";"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. I've just been under a lot of stress with this whole situation.\n\nHere's something for your help. It's not much, but we have a long trip ahead of us. I'm sure you understand."
"116521668-0-3096";"If Hosni stole the Dream Shard, he did it for Adima … and if so, he'll never give it to you.\n\nAnd you are here to recover the Dream Shard, aren't you? If you help me clear Hosni's name, I'll help you get it."
"116521668-0-3097";"Mara's heart! This is exactly what we needed. With this in hand my husband and I can escape this place and go to seek help.\n\nI have one final favor to ask."
"116521668-0-3098";"I watched from a dream as a nightmarish reflection of myself committed mad crimes of blood. I killed so many … I threatened my own parents ….\n\nRighting the wrongs I did here will take years—but thanks to you, I can at least start."
"116521668-0-3107";"It's a good thing you were here, or I imagine they would have summoned many more. \n\nI'm going to take these relics back to Pariah Abbey. I can escort Tabakah back too."
"116521668-0-3147";"Probably doesn't look like much to you, but this helm and armor withstood the blows of the Orc warlord Nahkdul, a Nord killer at Farrun. This axe lopped off that monster's misshapen head!\n\nI'll drink to those days. And more of them to come!"
"116521668-0-3148";"Even the greatest empire is a desolate domain without the ones you love.  \n\nI never learned that lesson in life, but I hope you have. May the Eight be with you, young traveler."
"116521668-0-3153";"Whoever these Supernal Dreamers are, they are cunning and clearly willing to go to great lengths to achieve their goals.\n\nI'm happy to be alive, and I'm also glad to know you stopped them cold."
"116521668-0-3167";"Thank Stendarr you happened by! With the denizens of death suppressed by your heroic efforts, it should now be within the capacity of my divine gifts to banish the works of the unholy and ….\n\nSorry. Anyway, after prayers I'll go clean up."

"116521668-0-3170";"I feared as much. We have to proceed carefully now. \n\nWe don't want to alert the duchess or King Fahara'jad to the fact that we know about the secret communications."
"116521668-0-3171";"There is nothing more to do. I can feel my unrest easing. My ties to this plane loosen... Aetherius pulls me. Farewell."
"116521668-0-3174";"Not as glad as I am. Believe me.\n\nIt seems I'll need to take over security here in the village, and with those slavers out there, I need to get busy.\n\nFirst though, I'm going to see if someone around here can give me a massage."

"116521668-0-3186";"What? The Knights of the Flame are sworn to protect me. Why would one try to take my life?\n\nI know Dame Falhut spoke out against my marriage to the duke. I can't imagine how that could motivate her to murder."
"116521668-0-3189";"I'm … sorry to hear that. \n\nYou did what had to be done, and I suppose her reaction merely proves her guilt."
"116521668-0-3190";"<<1>>? Was he mad? He was supposed to protect her! How will I explain this to Lakana's father? To her sister?\n\nLakana would never hurt anyone. She was innocent … my beloved wife."

"116521668-0-3654";"Our torment is finally over. Rosalind has forgiven me, though Stendarr knows I don't deserve it. \n\nOur thanks for bringing peace to Westtry and rest to us all. May you walk in Stendarr's light."
"116521668-0-3656";"Small comfort that is. Chamberlain Weller and I will burn the Duke's body. In secret, of course. No one needs to know what happened here.\n\nThis was bad business. Let's bring it to an end."
"116521668-0-3657";"Thank you. Wyress Emilie says a hag named Mother Murk was likely behind the abduction of the women. I wish we could stop her before she tries this again.\n\nAll this danger and adventure … we're so not cut out for this."
"116521668-0-3661";"Oh, my apologies. You must be the stranger who helped my sisters at Deleyn's Mill.\n\nI'm honored to meet you."
"116521668-0-3662";"I'm here because the one I loved gave up everything that day to save his people.\n\nYou seek answers. I'm here to help you find them and hopefully avoid the tragedy that occurred on that long ago day."
"116521668-0-3666";"No. You have done enough, more than enough.\n\nYou have restored the temple's treasures. These relics were all that was here when the temple was built … and they are all that is needed for it to be rebuilt."
"116521668-0-3676";"Indeed. With Mother Murk gone, the hags will wither and the wyrd will prosper. \n\nYou, however, have somewhere else to be. I see a long road ahead of you, traveler. Tread carefully."
"116521668-0-3681";"Are you, now? You're the first one today who still has all his arms and legs.\n\nAh, these are pretty. Pretty disgusting! Ha! Here, take your gold."
"116521668-0-3682";"He appeared? He appeared and spoke about me? I recognize this satchel. What's inside it? \n\nOh, Poppa. Ever the pragmatist. There's enough here to get supplies in Aldcroft. Then I can go on to Crosswych."
"116521668-0-3691";"Commander Parmion decided to accompany us, but it was a trap. We expected to find Faolchu and his officers, but there was a whole platoon waiting for us. \n\nWe couldn't stop them. The commander fought bravely, but they cut him down and took Alana."
"116521668-0-3692";"For the living, yes. But for us? Our curse continues.\n\nAt least you released Rosalind from her torment as an angry shade. That's all that really mattered to me. In time, perhaps, she'll even speak to me again."
"116521668-0-3694";"I thought as much. That's the story our family has passed down through the ages, but I needed proof. Now Camlorn must be told. \n\nYou know, what you've done here has changed everything. Maybe more than we know."
"116521668-0-3695";"Fire! Of course. That makes perfect sense. The beast can't stand against its purifying flame.\n\nWith your help, we will set Camlorn free and destroy Faolchu once and for all."
"116521668-0-3696";"Mortal, know that I am Donel Deleyn, once King of Daggerfall. Your deeds have not gone unnoticed, and I thank you for your help.\n\nHowever, the danger has not passed. These necromancers plan to enslave us and turn us against our descendants."
"116521668-0-3711";"Farewell, mortal. Your actions this day shall prove a decisive blow to the Bloodthorn cult and their evil master."
"116521668-0-3712";"Imprisoned! Our enemy is that powerful?\n\nWe will do whatever we can to help. The guardians must be set free."
"116521668-0-3717";"We are earth's bones. We endure. We knew someone would come to set us free. We just didn't know when it would happen or who it would be.\n\nIt seems right that you were the one. You are mortal, but also not mortal. Angof has much to fear from you."
"116521668-0-3718";"We're bringing in more troops, but that will take time. Until then, we hold this position. \n\nWe never would have gotten this far without your help."
"116521668-0-3737";"The talisman would be the key to defeating Angof—if its power wasn't depleted. We need to recharge the talisman. \n\nThen we'll finally get our chance to deal with Angof and take the battle to him!"

"116521668-0-4159";"We? We didn't stop the attack. You did.\n\nYou've given us crucial time to bring in reinforcements. Now we can repel this invasion before it gains a foothold. We owe you one for this. Good job!"
"116521668-0-4163";"Ten enemies of Daggerfall dead you say? Well done, yet again."
"116521668-0-4165";"There will be feasting this night! Good work, our bellies thank you."
"116521668-0-4166";"If you've seen a man starve to death, you'd know it's not a fate any man should face. However, the Ebonheart and Aldmeri are little more than beasts in my eyes so it's completely acceptable."
"116521668-0-4167";"Of course, of course. You've certainly been more useful than these hired hands.\n\nThe Baelbornes are once again on their way to the top, and I have you to thank for that. I'll always remember the small part you played to make this happen."
"116521668-0-4182";"There will be an answer for what's happened today. The firstborn of an Orc chief is dead. The stronghold will come for me. But my anger runs deeper than they'll expect. I'll gladly pit my rage against theirs.\n\nThank you for all you've done."
"116521668-0-4183";"You have shown me that I am as much a relic as the objects in this vault. A thing of the past. Adrift. It is time to go. I shall find Aetherius.\n\nAnd, at long last, peace."
"116521668-0-4184";"Truer words have rarely been spoken. Thank you for setting me free.\n\nBut heed this bit of advice before I depart. Not everything you meet in ancient ruins shall be as cordial as I. Fare you well."
"116521668-0-4187";"That we did, thanks to you.\n\nNow that we're all back together, we have a better chance to put an end to this Dominion incursion."
"116521668-0-4188";"Expertly done. The Ebonheart claims one more keep this day."
"116521668-0-4189";"There will be new weapons and armor forged with the ore we're pulling from our mine."
"116521668-0-4190";"You have done what was asked of you? Good."

"116521668-0-4196";"Perhaps there will be gold and silver to be had along with that stone."

"116521668-0-4484";"My brother's spell bound them to guard Davon's Watch.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this. It wasn't supposed to be like torture."
"116521668-0-4485";"Their leaders have moved beyond. May they find peace.\n\nFor now, the rest remain like moths. They're no threat to the living, but they'll soon follow."
"116521668-0-4487";"Yes, well. Ahem. I thank you for all you've done here today, traveler. My daughter is safe and I must … reluctantly … admit that the Argonian may have played a part.\n\nMay Lord, Mother, and Wizard all guard you on your journey."
"116521668-0-4488";"Let me see what you found.\n\nCovenant mercenaries? You've done well to bring this to me, traveler. I'll make sure this news reaches Mournhold."
"116521668-0-4489";"My brethren are safe, and the Ashlands bubble with hope. I pass now down the river, to swim in the currents of Aetherius. Go well in your own passage, traveler."
"116521668-0-4490";"Sacrificing our own people! This monstrosity must stop!\n\nThe commanders at Davon's Watch must see this immediately. And … and I must tell them about Giron."
"116521668-0-4494";"Ha! My fine f'lah! Well done. I'll see your name is not forgotten.\n\nAhknara, however, will be forgotten. The Dunmer reshape history to serve their needs. I'll remove any mention of her actions here, and I'll purge all records of that vile assassin."
"116521668-0-4499";"I will make this gift, this sacrifice. Trees, plants—one day it will all bloom again. Blood is water, water is life.\n\nMay the Hist embrace you."
"116521668-0-4502";"Good. These Orcs will be sorry they took me captive.\n\nWe Nords appreciate a nice, warm fire."
"116521668-0-4505";"I'm going to have to get the mine back open, of course. \n\nKwama are very good diggers, you know, particularly the workers."
"116521668-0-4508";"Shor's stones, you did it! \n\nThese troops heard the horn blow and came running from Narsis. With Gruznak gone, we can sweep up the rest of these Orcs in no time. You've got a heavy hand, friend. I like that."
"116521668-0-4517";"What's this? Notes? A journal? Attacked? Slow down.\n\nHmmm. I've never heard of Vox. And the thought of someone smuggling Llodos plague into Narsis frightens me greatly. But where are the missing people?"
"116521668-0-4520";"Then we are avenged. Our father is still dead, but at least the ones responsible for his death paid a price. \n\nWhy don't I feel any better?"
"116521668-0-4521";"These don't look like my pants, but thank you for finding the axe.\n\nI wish I could find that witch and teach her not to tangle with <<1>>!"
"116521668-0-4523";"Thank you. I'll make sure that gets to him too.\n\nDon't know if you're a friend of the family or what, but we appreciate you going to so much trouble. Take this for your efforts.\n\nI'll let you know when I've tracked down Scout Fontbonne."
"116521668-0-4527";"The greatest mage of my era, and you wake me for something they could have read in a book?\n\nIt's pathetic, but clearly, I must aid my people again. No deathworms for you just yet."
"116521668-0-4529";"No! I can't believe that. I won't.\n\nWhy? My Eanen wouldn't, no!"
"116521668-0-4530";"Excellent! My friend, you are an asset and blessing on the Pact. I sense the hand of the Three here."
"116521668-0-4531";"Yes! In the here and now, the guardians must have been disrupted or destroyed.\n\nSo it's simple! Fix the guardians and they'll draw Balreth's power back into them. Then you can bind or kill Balreth."
"116521668-0-4532";"I can't! I'll search Stonefalls until I find him.\n\nEven in death, I won't give up my love for him."
"116521668-0-4533";"Bless Azura!\n\nThank you. I'll run to him at once."
"116521668-0-4536";"I'm glad my trust was well placed. To lose the Hist branch, that would have been too much tragedy for me.\n\nSeeks-the-Night has caused me more than enough pain. How could he betray us to the pirate slavers? Is his heart really so full of hate?"
"116521668-0-4537";"That's thanks to you. As I said, I honor my debts, but until we drive the Covenant from Stonefalls, this is all I can offer.\n\nNow, I must speak with Dedras. He smells like he dishonored himself."
"116521668-0-4539";"Nede blood! I should have seen this! The Chimer thought they were gods. Backed into a corner, they turned to dark rituals.\n\nThis was dangerous magic. I must contemplate this. Still, I am quite grateful that you did not fail."
"116521668-0-4545";"The traitor is dead, but that brings me no joy. I can only hope that Silent Mire will be left in peace once more.\n\nI'll return the branch to Leel-Vata. Take this, friend. It's not much, but it's what we can spare."
"116521668-0-4552";"They're missing! We found <<1>>. We were escorting him home when we were ambushed.\n\nThe Goblins must have taken them both!"
"116521668-0-4553";"Shor's bones, traveler! Without your help, we'd be attending my son's funeral instead of celebrating a victory over the Goblins."
"116521668-0-4557";"The Othrys use these animals to haul carts of sulfur to market, but they don't care about them like I do.\n\nWhether or not you care about the guar, you've helped them … and me. I think I owe you this."
"116521668-0-4558";"You're just in time. Our people are being slaughtered. General Balreth needs to prepare at the altar. We've got some dirty business ahead.\n\nIt's time to teach these savages what it means to cross the Chimer."
"116521668-0-4559";"We still have plenty of work to do. Without reinforcements, these troops won't last long. And I'm sure Serien won't give up without a fight.\n\nThe real battle has just begun."
"116521668-0-4560";"That Covenant general is a monster. Thank you, soldier. We'll ensure the dead rest peacefully."
"116521668-0-4561";"He's planning to use it to release Sadal, the second Brother of Strife. \n\nWe've got to stop him. All of Stonefalls will suffer if Tanval exploits the Tormented Spire."
"116521668-0-4562";"Hah, don't we all?\n\nI wish you luck, stranger, but you probably won't find much here. Grandmaster Omin has been transformed from a bloodthirsty nix hound into a simpering guar. Maybe one of the guardsmen here can tell you more. I want no part of it."
"116521668-0-4564";"King Emeric? That—that is bad. We just received word that the king has fallen ill.\n\nIt cannot be a coincidence. Vaermina is raising the stakes. She makes a final bid for power by assaulting our king."
"116521668-0-4567";"Having him alive might have been useful, but having him dead is just as good.\n\nThe ritual items in the shack on the docks and his belongings might tell us something more."
"116521668-0-4572";"Well done. While you were out saving people, I've been working on a way to stop this thing. And I think I'm onto something."
"116521668-0-4573";"Two of the Telvanni are grateful to you. I'll spread word of your deeds to the others.\n\nShould you have need of us again, just ask. Until then, may Vivec guide your path."
"116521668-0-4575";"<<1>> claimed he saw House Dres poison our Hist Tree. Then he gave a bottle to this tree-licking waste of flesh.\n\nI smell worm scat. Someone has been playing us for fools, and I no longer believe it's House Dres."
"116521668-0-4577";"I want nothing that belonged to that dirty cat-man Ra-shadda. \n\nHe brought that monster here. He must know a way to send it back."
"116521668-0-4582";"Then perhaps you understand how delicious revenge can be. Every insult and every slight must be returned in kind.\n\nYou honor us, friend. Take this and kill any who may wrong you!"
"116521668-0-4584";"Indeed. The ladies here sure kicked up a bit of a fuss. But we can put that behind us and I can make some gold. And the Mabrigash, too, of course.\n\nI'll make sure to mind my manners going forward. Wouldn't do to upset the Farseer again."
"116521668-0-4585";"Your choice satisfies me. Raston will serve the Ghost Snake well.\n\nYou have my thanks for your sage counsel."
"116521668-0-4586";"Steal them.\n\nThe House Hlaalu armory has everything we need to launch a full assault. If you really want to help, that's what we need."
"116521668-0-4591";"What? Madras is going to get those people killed. They're farmers and peasants, not soldiers!\n\nI can't let them do this."
"116521668-0-4592";"That's good news.\n\nI also heard from my associate, Naryu Virian. We may have finally gotten a few breaks in this sordid situation."
"116521668-0-4595";"I can't believe she was so selfish and thoughtless. Maybe I'll send her to my mother's netch farm in Stonefalls. She'll hate that even more than Deepcrag."
"116521668-0-4596";"This is good quality cuttle. Very smooth and pliable. Useful for making potions and salves.\n\nIt would have been a shame to just leave them on the dead kwama."
"116521668-0-4597";"That's good news. I've also had a slight change of plans."
"116521668-0-4598";"I don't know. I only know what the reports tell me.\n\nGiron probably took Ralden somewhere secluded, far from prying eyes."
"116521668-0-4600";"Narsis is safe, at least for now. We'll get these people to the healers. You should get some rest. I fear things are about to get more complicated.\n\nThe Maulborn are more dangerous than we thought. I'm sure your help will be needed again."
"116521668-0-4602";"He didn't know why? If he was willing to attack and kill us without even questioning his orders, he's better off dead.\n\nWell done. Thank you, outsider."
"116521668-0-4603";"So he's under the impression he's been rescued? We'll have to correct that.\n\nI appreciate your help. Though when we're done with him, I doubt Omalor will be very happy."
"116521668-0-4604";"Right! Things like that, they're exactly why we keep to ourselves in the Elven lands—that and the bad food.\n\nAnyway, you're all right. Tell that fancy Othral we'll fight. Come back and drink with us again sometime."
"116521668-0-4606";"This … this is very nearly everything! I can't believe it. My employer might even be lenient!\n\nYou've saved me. You didn't have to help, but you did. Thank you."
"116521668-0-4609";"The ruins by the river? The General had them sealed off and commanded that the place was off limits. Huh. Curiouser and curiouser."
"116521668-0-4611";"What? Have I been a fool? I questioned my faith for the flimsiest of reasons and caused others to question theirs. I have much to do to correct my failure.\n\nI wish I knew why Rhavil Urano's doubting words were so compelling."
"116521668-0-4619";"Shor's bones! It's good to see another competent fighter.\n\nGeneral Serien has dug into Fort Virak like a tick on a dog, and we're having a cursed hard time digging him out."
"116521668-0-4621";"You are a true gambler to risk your life in such a fashion. It is my pleasure to award you with these lovely items. Please accept these as a small token of my respect for you."
"116521668-0-4622";"I … what was I saying? \n\nDid Scout Mamyne send you? I was glad she got away. The others … they're all gone."
"116521668-0-4624";"He can stay there a while longer. That would make it easier for you to work on my side, wouldn't it?\n\nAnd after you help me rid my town of this Khajiiti upstart, we'll both have what we want."
"116521668-0-4628";"Yes, and you did it well! Few make it past the Trial of the Mind, let alone all three trials. They're necessary to prepare one's body and spirit for what comes next."
"116521668-0-4629";"You unlocked a secret from our past, one so well-hidden we didn't see it ourselves. We'll retain this memory until it is lost once more. Then, in a time of great need, the Hist will reveal your deeds to our descendants."
"116521668-0-4630";"Our relics, stolen by one of our own? He knew their lack of worth to outsiders. Perhaps his egg spent too much time in the shade before his hatching.\n\nNo matter, it's enough you've returned them to us."
"116521668-0-4631";"What would the Dominion gain by keeping pilgrims from the Trials? It is senseless!"
"116521668-0-4636";"The shame of it makes my scales brittle, but yes, I summoned it. I could not bear to see another victim fall to the raiders.\n\nI couldn't let them take our mine, so I reached out to Fatestealer. All of us were scorched."
"116521668-0-4637";"Just like a headstrong Nord to throw protocol to the wind. Perhaps we could all learn from her.\n\nExcuse me, my friend. I believe I have an officer to promote."
"116521668-0-4638";"Ha! You surprised us all! Especially the Sentinels. I'd say their bullying days are over. Well played!"
"116521668-0-4640";"Then the Worm Cult holds no power over our village. But now, neither do I."
"116521668-0-4641";"Then we can concentrate our efforts elsewhere. Many will blame the Shadowscales regardless, but our concerns are greater now than scapegoats.\n\nI fear the true culprit struck again, though I pray I'm incorrect."
"116521668-0-4642";"I'd be better if the damned ruins beneath my feet weren't infested with Dominion! We've posted guards until reinforcements can wipe them clean.\n\nYou kept this city from tearing itself apart. Stormhold's in your debt."
"116521668-0-4643";"Said he stirred up trouble with some mercs and had to leave town. Asked <<1>> to take over his shop, permanently.\n\nMentioned you, too. Said he'd pay you extra for your silence. Said you were smart enough to take a hint."
"116521668-0-4651";"Truly? The honored dead of Kragenmoor have been interred in those tombs for centuries. They were built to honor the Daedra in the time of the Chimer. \n\nWell done, indeed."
"116521668-0-4652";"Accept the thanks and esteem of House Dres. Now that my son is safe, I entrust the second key to Tormented Spire to you. \n\nUse it. Stop Tanval Indoril."
"116521668-0-4653";"Thanks. Not everyone would stop to help a simple farmer.\n\nI'll praise your name to every guar herder in Stonefalls."
"116521668-0-4654";"So, did you get the key from the grandmaster at Kragenmoor?"
"116521668-0-4656";"Partnership? Not much choice, is there? We can aid you in exchange for our lives. We can help you get our treasure for One-Eye.\n\nIf you're on One-Eye's good side, this is better for all of us."
"116521668-0-4662";"Though violence still threatens our sanctuary, I am grateful. I know Hedranna. And I know we both desire peace. \n\nWhat can we do to gather it in our arms?"
"116521668-0-4664";"Don't be modest. <<1>> boasted of your skills. I've offered the pirates letters of marque to seize any Dominion ships they find.\n\nYou've earned a reward. Take it with the gratitude of Stormhold and the wardens."
"116521668-0-4671";"Hmph. Normally I wouldn't be quick to believe such a tale, but the book Saryvn brought back seems to support it.\n\nTake this for your efforts. Leave Saryvn to me."
"116521668-0-4672";"That's more in line with the Saryvn I know than the tale he told me.\n\nYou did well by telling me the truth. I'll deal with Saryvn."
"116521668-0-4675";"By the Three, let's hope the Vereansu go home now. I just pray I haven't made things worse. I left the army to get the blood off my hands, but look how that turned out. You killed him, but I let the arrow fly.\n\nStill, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-4676";"Hey, I'm not an alchemist. I can only tell you what Varon told me. \n\nThat stuff is potent. It spreads like wildfire. As soon as it touches skin, people transform into husks."
"116521668-0-4689";"At last! You've freed us from our miserable existence. This was no life, just a mockery of better days.\n\nI feel Clavicus Vile's curse fading. It won't be long, now. Thank you for allowing us the dignity of death."
"116521668-0-4695";"I feared those necromancers had captured you. Such a pity about our guards. They served us well, and never deserved such a fate.\n\nI'm going to stay here until I'm sure it's safe to travel. Best of luck to you, my friend."
"116521668-0-4700";"I heard their angry buzzing from here! And the yelps of the Khajiit! That's wonderful.\n\nYou would make a good alchemy apprentice—but some other time. I've too much to do right now."
"116521668-0-4702";"You don't wish to become captain of the royal army? We apologize, but the only other position is royal consort. Though we seek to cause no offense, you simply don't intrigue us in that fashion."
"116521668-0-4703";"Absorbed it? I'm not sure how I'll report that to the vicecanons, but you recovered it. That's all that matters."
"116521668-0-4704";"Very interesting! One can learn much from Ayleid ruins. I must visit this place myself!\n\nA grand discovery. You did the right thing to bring these to Hissmir. I will guard this treasure and keep it safe."
"116521668-0-4707";"Well done! Another menace successfully overcome. I love it when that happens.\n\nCan I have the resonators? I want to examine them. Maybe I can figure out a way to craft a defense against the constructs, in case something like this happens again."
"116521668-0-4708";"Thank you. Once the relic is safe and the Ashlanders are gone, we'll be able to resume our work. \n\nI may not be brave, but if I can help my order treat the afflicted, I will."
"116521668-0-4715";"You've protected <<1>> from weak thinking and necromantic tyranny. More than anything, you've given us a future. Possibly beyond these huts in this swamp.\n\nWe're our own people now, and we couldn't have been without your help."
"116521668-0-4717";"What? I haven't heard from her in years! Why did she decide to write me after all this time? She and Keenash, my wife, did not get along.\n\nBut now Keenash is dead. It's comforting to know <<1>> still thinks fondly of me."
"116521668-0-4720";"I'll wear it always, to remember my beautiful, brave Risa.\n\nThank you so much for easing an old woman's grief."
"116521668-0-4721";"No, she is not destroyed. Only silenced for a time.\n\nShe is old, perhaps as old as the swamps themselves. I do not know what caused her to take an interest in the living, but this does not bode well for any of us."
"116521668-0-4724";"Ah, yes! <<1>>. That one is stronger than she knows. She hid from the Dominion soldiers for days before we snuck her out.\n\nI'm glad you're here. There's plenty that needs doing."
"116521668-0-4725";"Good. But I won't forgive that Khajiit for Tiril's death. Even if he does forgive me for the death of his wife.\n\nBut I suppose there's been enough killing."
"116521668-0-4726";"You should take the vessel to the wispmother. She is powerful right now, so first, you must weaken her.\n\nThen open the vessel, so it can take in her corrupted soul."
"116521668-0-4731";"Cool rain on my scales. We'll reforge the shackles Garyn and his father destroyed. The Brother of Strife will be returned to his rest."
"116521668-0-4732";"Yes, Balreth is defeated. Argonians, Dunmer, and Nords working together—one might almost think we had formed a Pact!"
"116521668-0-4733";"So you helped out <<1>>, all by yourself?\n\nThat's the best news I've heard all day. If the lot of us don't die tonight, I'll buy you a drink."
"116521668-0-4734";"Walks-in-Ash, eh? A wise lizard, or so the lads say. Well, you're welcome here. The Captain has a lot in his trencher, and we're not sure how to get it all down."
"116521668-0-4735";"Just as the moon cycles through the month, true evil cannot be destroyed.\n\nBut there was more to this wispmother than evil. There was love. Its love was twisted, but I think it cared for him."
"116521668-0-4736";"I don't know. I should stay here, if <<1>> will allow it. No other place will give me safe haven, and my people will want to execute me for treason.\n\nI can still study. Perhaps someday, I can even be forgiven."
"116521668-0-4741";"Splendid1 This nature of this crystal doesn't make me noble. People are born that way. Rather, it makes me rich, and that's the most important thing of all."
"116521668-0-4742";"I am relieved. My wizard can repair them."
"116521668-0-4743";"Excellent! How did you succeed where so many others failed? Wait, never mind, I don't really care how. Thanks again!"
"116521668-0-4744";"Dude, you're awesome."
"116521668-0-4745";"You've done a great service today, friend. I'm sure my wizard can fuse the shards and make the crystal whole again. Take this as a reward for your efforts."
"116521668-0-4746";"Others have made this claim. Others have died. Still, I enjoy watching a good challenge.\n\nHmm. I see you have powerful allies of your own. Almalexia and Veloth. But they can't help you here."
"116521668-0-4756";"I'm fine, though my silk doublet is ruined."
"116521668-0-4757";"Thank goodness you freed me. I just made it out of there. I feel like something of a failure, but I am glad you came along when you did."
"116521668-0-4759";"You're a true hero for saving me. Here's a small token of my gratitude, though it's probably a lot to someone like you."
"116521668-0-4761";"Thank you so much for your help! Yay!"
"116521668-0-4763";"Thanks for your help. I'll go find my father."
"116521668-0-4765";"This news is good. I wish it broke through my gloom.\n\nPash-Riha has yet to return. My scales should be thickened with dread by now, but they are not."
"116521668-0-4766";"You have shown me I have much to learn. Mota Fang does not belong in my hands. I will train, so that someday these fingers will appreciate a similar blade.\n\nBut Mota? She belongs to you now."
"116521668-0-4768";"Man, you must have put the hurt down on him. I heard him crying all the way over here!"
"116521668-0-4772";"Huzzah!  You did it! Well done <<1>>."
"116521668-0-4806";"And won, apparently.\n\nSpeak with Gaston. He'll want to know his spell can be completed. It's just as well. That beast needs to be contained. And I still want to split Gaston's skull open for sending us down there—if it weren't for you …."
"116521668-0-4849";"We're not done quite yet. The spell will require a few moments to fully take effect.\n\nBut I can handle things from here."
"116521668-0-4913";"Thank you, stranger. \n\nWith this dark act behind us, we can get on with our lives. No Elves will own me or my family again."
"116521668-0-4931";"Now I guess I'll see about restoring my family's fortune. Eventually this unnatural Pact will fall apart and we can return to farming the old-fashioned way. Please, take this in gratitude for your help."
"116521668-0-4942";"I … do not understand these words. But their performance is said to have made Dark Elves writhe on the ground with laughter. Perhaps this will finally immerse me in the River of Humor.\n\nHere we go."
"116521668-0-4943";"It is well. You've proven the strength of my Great House, and you brought my son home safely.\n\nI now name you the Hand of Dres and offer you my aid, should you need it in the future. To their friends, the Dres are generous."
"116521668-0-4946";"When you banished Namira's corruption, you allowed me to reconnect with the Hist throughout Xal Ithix. There is still work to be done, but, thanks to you, we can now complete the cleansing.\n\nThank you. You will be remembered."
"116521668-0-4948";"Truly the Three have touched this temple! The spirits of past Ordinators now guard our walls. Peace at last.\n\nNow if only … wait, who is that?"
"116521668-0-4949";"I don't know what to say. Thank you.\n\nI'll find a way to make up for this. I swear it."
"116521668-0-4951";"Still, we can't lower our defenses yet. This was just one piece of the Maulborn scheme. \n\nBut for now, the Gorge—and Mournhold—are safe."
"116521668-0-4956";"You'll know when the time comes. By now, my agents should have retaken Murkwater. They'll be celebrating in the village as we speak."
"116521668-0-4966";"<<1>>? That poor village.\n\nI hope the Shadowscales made the Dominion's conquest a costly one!"
"116521668-0-5035";"Ziddak's fatal flaw was rage, not cowardice. Now there is no male in our tribe fit to take his place.\n\nSome of the housemen at the temple want revenge. They will hunt our people, so Tirinaat and I are leaving."
"116521668-0-5037";"How strange that someone would do something that senseless. Thanks for your help, friend. \n\nThe mine will be working again shortly. We'll keep an eye out for trouble in the future."
"116521668-0-5043";"My eyes are round with wonderment! Look what you have brought us. We accept these fantastic gifts.\n\nWe now show our respect for the excellent Dunmer culture. Wait a moment while we change into this stylish Dunmer garb."
"116521668-0-5045";"You saw the pain that drove Vox to unleash the plague and rally the Maulborn to glorious acts of violence. Now you understand her motives and are finally ready to face her.\n\nWell, except for the power of Veloth's hammer. You can't overcome that."
"116521668-0-5046";"Hey, I wouldn't want the death of the last Kothringi on my conscience. Far as I'm concerned, the keystone was lost to the swamps."
"116521668-0-5059";"The job's done. I guess that's all that matters. Here. This is the advance payment we received, minus our expenses.\n\nNot bad for a day's work, right?"
"116521668-0-5060";"I will discover what powers the Judgment of Veloth possesses and why Vox has stolen it. In the meantime, you must pursue Magistrix Vox.\n\nFor your heroism and service this day, I name you a Hand of Almalexia. Go with my blessing upon you."
"116521668-0-5061";"Go now, exalted by my blessing, to Eidolon's Hollow. \n\nStop Magistrix Vox and put an end to her madness."
"116521668-0-5062";"Ugh, what a disgusting mess you get when you put a bunch of Dremora hearts in a sack.  \n\nBut thanks for bringing them to me. The potions I can make with these will help a lot."
"116521668-0-5065";"May the swamp give you bountiful fruit, plentiful fish, and sharp stones, my friend.\n\nYou've done a great service for our egg-brother, and it will not be forgotten."
"116521668-0-5068";"Yes, by Vivec! Sadal is trapped between this realm and Oblivion. With the final ward down, his prison is vulnerable.\n\nNow we can strike. We'll undo the mistakes of House Indoril."
"116521668-0-5069";"Our ritual was a success—a bitter one, to be sure. We died, but our Hist tree lives. As we return to the Hist, so will the tree heal. \n\nSomeday, there will be a new clutch hatched here. If ever you return, they will remember your courage."
"116521668-0-5070";"I have a reward for you. It isn't much, but I stole this from their camp. It's yours.\n\nNow to make the rest of these invaders suffer."
"116521668-0-5076";"Holgunn, Walks-In-Ash, the Vanguard, and myself. We'll follow you into Oblivion and beyond. \n\nGaryn trusted you. I only wish I had done the same."
"116521668-0-5077";"Yes, but your journey continues. The time has come for you to move on.\n\nWe will work to restore order in Morrowind. You may leave that to the Three."
"116521668-0-5082";"<The construct sits still for a moment, and then its legs activate as if they're preparing for motion.>"
"116521668-0-5085";"Xuth! I have heard of such things, but didn't think the Dominion capable of such a horrific act. Skin-stealers! \n\nAnd yet, the spirits of Njorlund and Saervild rejoin the One, and their empty shells nourish the roots of the tree. Many thanks to you."
"116521668-0-5087";"Aha! About time. If the general wants me to hold this tower, he needs to send me medical supplies more often.\n\nI bet there's more to this than meets the eye."
"116521668-0-5088";"You used it to release the prisoners? I hope they were worth it. The keystones may be our only hope for defeating the Dominion.\n\nStill, the vicecanons sent word. I trust your decision will be best for Shadowfen."
"116521668-0-5090";"I am. This was our favorite place in the prison. We'd meet in secret, dreaming of escape and our life beyond these walls.\n\nOnce the guards found us and punished me severely, but those fleeting moments of peace were worth every lash."
"116521668-0-5092";"These ragged bits of bone? This is what became of me? Yes, that must be true. So strange to sit beside myself.\n\nI can feel the call of the swamps, the caress of the roots. I thank you."
"116521668-0-5093";"When presented with a miracle, Redguards normally thank Tall Papa. But he didn't show up down here to untie me. So. \n\nThanks go to you, my friend. The Covenant owes you a debt."
"116521668-0-5094";"You absorbed it? \n\nWell, I suppose that's better than leaving it, as long as we can still access its power."
"116521668-0-5096";"Carry on? Oh, father … we'll try. But we'll miss him so.\n\nAt least we know what happened. Thanks for freeing us from this horror."
"116521668-0-5105";"I hope these two have learned from their mistakes. Spellcrafting is not to be taken lightly. Like a Goblin's heart, apparently."
"116521668-0-5106";"Oh. That's good, then. I'm pleased to see a friendly snout. That's much better than all the dead faces lately.\n\nWhy is it Elves who die cannot stay in the ground?"
"116521668-0-5107";"You've done a great service for the guild today, comrade. I look forward to drawing steel with you in the future.\n\nIf we learn anything from the journal, I'll make sure you hear about it."
"116521668-0-5110";"Thank you. I'll begin my research straight away. You'll be the first we contact once I know the details.\n\nIn the meantime, Sees-All-Colors sends her regrets she couldn't stay. She said she had an urgent matter to attend to."
"116521668-0-5114";"Ah, it's good to make new business acquaintances.\n\nRemember Naril Heleran, my friend. We may see each other again."
"116521668-0-5117";"congrats, you clicked both the chest and the rock."
"116521668-0-5118";"Masterfully done. Truly a procurement worthy of praise … and reward!\n\nIt's an honor and a privilege doing business with you, friend."
"116521668-0-5120";"So Raynor's control rod actually works. Do you believe it?\n\nLet's see those parts. I think I know how to fix this thing."
"116521668-0-5122";"These beasts made our people suffer. We've gathered this reward for you.\n\nI could pray for your kills to be quick and many, but you don't need my blessings. You're already a great hunter."
"116521668-0-5124";"I … you're right. That stuff doesn't belong to me.\n\nI'll make sure the families get their goods back. And I'm sorry for making up that story."
"116521668-0-5131";"He what? Kyne take him! Wherever he is, I'm sure the old bastard is laughing at me. Imagine. Leading the military here, alone.\n\nI suppose I should thank you, my friend. Without you, well, I hope to see you again before we meet in Sovngarde."
"116521668-0-5139";"You have completed all the talking tasks.  Well done."
"116521668-0-5142";"Here's something we found near the ruin. Please take it for helping us.\n\nYou know, you're not bad to have around. Feel free to come dungeon delving with us whenever you want!"
"116521668-0-5154";"Thank you. Take this as a reward.\n\nIt may not seem like much, but even one dead enemy could mean the difference between victory and defeat."
"116521668-0-5155";"Ah, yes. I was told you might report to me.\n\nOn behalf of the Tribunal, the Ordinators thank you and offer this reward. And may the Three watch over you."
"116521668-0-5163";"This … no! This isn't happening!"
"116521668-0-5166";"Merric, Aelif, and I will confer with the council of Provost Generals. We'll want to talk about the attack, and this revelation about Guildmaster Iceblade. We'll contact you again, when there's more to discuss. Until then, comrade."
"116521668-0-5167";"<Haldyn's journal is filled with lurid and disturbing fantasies involving Daedra, clearly the work of a disturbed mind.>\n\n<There are some shoddy clothes and pouches of gold. The author evidently used his life's savings to pursue his dream.>"
"116521668-0-5169";"Ancient relics. But know this: the creations of my ancestors are not toys. Many possess aspects of the Hist that were dangerous even then.\n\nI thank you for what you've done so far, but the danger isn't over. We must proceed carefully."
"116521668-0-5170";"Give me the Fang. I've got a special coffer that will deaden its spell. What happened to <<1>> need not happen to anyone else.\n\nPoor bastard. I'll miss him. And he only had one Fang of Sithis? There should have been two. Hmm."
"116521668-0-5171";"I don't know what you're planning, but I need a good, long rest. I'll head over to Hatching Pools in a few days.\n\nYou have a new weapon to try out, I think. I wish you luck, and long life!"
"116521668-0-5182";"I remember my death, but that is the past now. You have more pressing matters to deal with than to listen to a ghost's stories. You have the decanter now."
"116521668-0-5183";"We will figure that out together. Though the invitation didn't start out in your hands, that's where it ended up. You were meant to be here. \n\nA great danger approaches this Academy. And you will save us from this disaster. I have foreseen it!"
"116521668-0-5187";"We receive these scrolls on behalf of the Golden Eye. We vow to begin our research anew.\n\nThis will take generations, but what is time to the Abider in the Abyss?"
"116521668-0-5191";"Sees-All-Colors will be found, and thrown in a cell. Stay in touch comrade. We will need you when the time comes. Until then …."
"116521668-0-5196";"<<1>> won't talk to me. He ran up and hugged me, but he won't speak to me!\n\nAt least we're both alive. We're together again, thanks to you."
"116521668-0-5204";"He's alive, though? Ayem bless you, my friend. I'll get things squared away here and make my way to the tower.\n\nI can't believe my fortune, running into you here. Thank you for your help."
"116521668-0-5205";"Yes, he did, and he told me a most peculiar tale. \n\nI owe you for getting him out of this mess. Take these coins. It's the least I can do."
"116521668-0-5206";"My father's dead? Vivec's wrath, what in Oblivion happened? Those notes you found … what was my father doing in this place?\n\nPlease, leave me. I need to think."
"116521668-0-5213";"So I heard. Well done. \n\nHere, take this as a token of my appreciation. But don't get too comfortable. Matters of grave urgency loom on the horizon."
"116521668-0-5214";"Thank the Three! And thank you, friend. Now I can do something to help these injured people."
"116521668-0-5215";"Feyne came here to please me. It's only fair we should return to Narsis to please her.\n\nThanks for helping me decide."
"116521668-0-5220";"Excellent work silencing the target. You've proven your worth. Enclosed you'll find a reward and an invitation to Sanctuary."
"116521668-0-5221";"Don't be silly. Ah, here it is.\n\nTake my wand. It worked better for you, anyway. Remember me when you use it."
"116521668-0-5234";"Good. Avenging Tiril's murder will require the deaths of many more Cat-Men. As you said, his kind must pay."
"116521668-0-5247";"Three bless you and thank you! \n\nNow we can see about restoring some order to this chaos."
"116521668-0-5251";"Our former master gave him this necklace. My son wore it to remind himself that not every Dark Elf is cruel.\n\nAt least <<1>> returned to the Hist a free Argonian. Thank you for finding him."
"116521668-0-5256";"Indeed! Your efforts will be rewarded, my featherless subject. You are the first to satisfy the terms of our toll.\n\nI hereby bestow upon you citizenship in these woods, as well as vassal servants to aid you. Welcome to Crow's Wood, fledgling."
"116521668-0-5257";"In the meantime, keep an eye out during your travels. There are many lost tomes scattered throughout Tamriel.\n\nWho knows? Any one of these books may help us restore Shalidor's lost island haven."
"116521668-0-5261";"My scales are truly dry now, my friend. I erect the spine of regret.\n\nSomeday, I will cool my tail in the River of Humor. My quest continues."
"116521668-0-5264";"Fascinating. That's not what I expected. Perhaps I should pick up an alchemical text or two, purely to augment my own talent, of course.\n\nThank you. Swim swiftly."
"116521668-0-5265";"Give me the Fang. I've got a special coffer to shield me from its magic. What happened to <<1>> need not happen to anyone else.\n\nPoor bastard. I'm glad he survived. But he only had one Fang of Sithis? There should be two. Hmm."
"116521668-0-5266";"And here's your reward, as promised.\n\nIf you ever need someone to put in a good word for you, let me know. I always repay my debts."
"116521668-0-5267";"Oh. I'm almost afraid to ask what happened. I hope this trial wasn't too painful ….\n\nI'll start translating this book right away. We've got one more trial to go. Nice work."
"116521668-0-5268";"Great to hear it. Now quiet down or you'll get us both killed!"
"116521668-0-5269";"A thousand curses on the Reachmen! Sinmur must be stopped, somehow."
"116521668-0-5270";"I can't believe anyone survived. Shor's Stone is forever in your debt."
"116521668-0-5273";"It's a hard life out here in the White. Somewhere off in Sovngarde, Treva's smiling down at us.\n\nYou're a part of the clan now. Fight well!"
"116521668-0-5274";"Aye! And I'll be lucky if Odana doesn't toss me in the lake tonight. Still, don't doubt it for a minute, my friend. The song of this day will be sung from every tavern in Skyrim."
"116521668-0-5275";"You've done us a good turn! I'd hate to think of the knowledge we could have lost. You have my thanks. And my mead!"
"116521668-0-5277";"We'll find shelter for those who lost their homes. Maybe the Temple of Mara can put them up. You've done a good turn for the people here. Thanks."
"116521668-0-5279";"By the Eight, no! My beloved Hodmar! He was so strong, so tough. I thought he made it out alive. \n\nBy Mara, I'll kill those Goblins, one and all!"
"116521668-0-5280";"That's a dark twist in the river. I'll send troops to investigate the ruin.\n\nIt's been dirty work, but I thank you for your help."
"116521668-0-5282";"Indeed! So few manage to satisfy the terms of our toll.\n\nYou shall be rewarded. I hereby bestow upon you citizenship of these woods, as well as vassal servants to aid you. Welcome to Crow's Wood, fledgling."
"116521668-0-5285";"Good. Now I can repair the Crystal of Power and make sure the ritual never occurs."
"116521668-0-5287";"Oh, thank you! They taste like candy."
"116521668-0-5288";"Oh, thank you! You have my eternal thanks. But I fear that we are not out of the woods yet."
"116521668-0-5289";"Ah, the shards! Finally, I can have my wizard restore the crystal. Here is your reward for your trouble."
"116521668-0-5290";"That's wonderful. We're all saved!"
"116521668-0-5300";"Hurry."
"116521668-0-5301";"Thank you! I'm forever in your debt."
"116521668-0-5302";"Never!"
"116521668-0-5303";"Okay, that's done."
"116521668-0-5304";"Ha ha! Got your nose!"
"116521668-0-5305";"Thank you, sir! I'll be returning home, shortly."
"116521668-0-5306";"At least I get to stretch my legs. Thanks for that."
"116521668-0-5307";"Thank you for freeing me! You rock!"
"116521668-0-5311";"I'm impressed. In truth I didn't expect you to surive."
"116521668-0-5312";"Rest in peace shape shifter."
"116521668-0-5313";"Oh, happy days! I've tied my crystal back together with string and you've murdered several human beings with very little prodding. Hooray!"
"116521668-0-5314";"Well done! Now the Supernal Dreamers should trouble us no more."
"116521668-0-5315";"Thank you for dealing with Remelie. Here is a little something for your work."
"116521668-0-5316";"Well, then I'm done here."
"116521668-0-5317";"Good, without their leader they won't be summoning anything."
"116521668-0-5318";"Quelle horreur! When I said kill him, I didn't mean ""kill him."""
"116521668-0-5319";"You've done it! We have them all. Now I just need to closely study the books, together as a set.\n\nAnd we should be able to find Shalidor's island!"
"116521668-0-5328";"No, you fool! Now Test Realm will be subjugated by summoned daedra for ages!\n\nJust take what I have left and go."
"116521668-0-5329";"Oh noes! Well, here's your reward anyway."
"116521668-0-5330";"Sorry for the pain, just give me the reward."
"116521668-0-5331";"You're a real piece of work. Here, don't expect my favor in the future."
"116521668-0-5332";"I will vanish like Artaeum."
"116521668-0-5333";"Get out of here!"
"116521668-0-5334";"Oh, bitter fate. Now my crystal is my only friend."
"116521668-0-5338";"About damn time we got some help out here. We're outmatched!\n\nCaptain Diiril will give you a little more insight into what's happening here."
"116521668-0-5339";"So the rumors are true?\n\nDumac take the Maulborn and the trouble they've caused! We won't let the Gorge fall again."
"116521668-0-5342";"You have my thanks. These vine-twisted abominations may yet prove useful."
"116521668-0-5345";"This confirms it. The Maulborn need to be wiped out.\n\nThanks for bringing this news, traveler. I'll inform the house leaders at once."
"116521668-0-5346";"Wish we could have tossed Reachmen into the fire. Burn them like cordwood, add a little color to the smoke! Hah!"
"116521668-0-5348";"<Plant the Pact banner for Melril!>"
"116521668-0-5351";"<<1>> and I will marry. We'll rebuild our homes here, once the Daedra leave. And of course, <<2>> will live with us.\n\nNone of this would be possible without your help."
"116521668-0-5352";"I'm taking this straight to King Fahara'jad in Sentinel. It will take time to translate all of this, but the results will be worth it.\n\nYou made this all possible. Thank you, my friend."
"116521668-0-5355";"<This vessel is coated in frost, like the knight's sword you found earlier. Tiny cracks radiate across its surface.>"
"116521668-0-5356";"I don't know what happened. The elders were gathered in the center of town.\n\nThen there was a flash and suddenly spirits were everywhere."
"116521668-0-5359";"I'll make sure the Centurion … the Pact knows of Stral's defeat. Dajaheel and Belron sacrificed themselves to see that beast slain.\n\nTheir sacrifice will be remembered."
"116521668-0-5364";"Oh, Tavo! Why did you take such foolish chances? We could have found another way.\n\nThank you for your kindness. Such courtesy is uncommon in these times. At least, now I can move on without the shadow of debt hanging over me."
"116521668-0-5365";"I don't know what to say. You bring gifts from the gods in my time of sorrow."
"116521668-0-5376";"It's as I feared, then. Wuuthrad is the only weapon we know that can send Sinmur back to Oblivion. Trolls take every one of them!"
"116521668-0-5379";"Another mouth to feed and house. You'd better be good!"
"116521668-0-5380";"I've always wanted to be a healer. Feyne and I can go anywhere once my training is complete.\n\nThank you for helping me decide."
"116521668-0-5381";"I'll not allow the wounded to become food for lamias. Pact or Dominion, I don't care. None deserve such a fate."
"116521668-0-5389";"I need to get all the relics rounded up, but my fool son has run off into the swamp again. No help, that one.\n\nI swear he takes after his mother's side of the family."
"116521668-0-5392";"You've been a lifesaver, literally. Charadin and I are going to publish a report about our adventures here. Your heroism will figure prominently!"
"116521668-0-5393";"The Worm Cult has made a mess of this dig site. We arrived in time to blunt their first assault, but they'll be back. I don't know if we'll live through another one, but I won't abandon these people."
"116521668-0-5395";"Ulrich was my father? Can that be true? Mother adored him, but so did we all. And he died a hero?\n\nAt least he's at peace now. Thank you. If my … my father could lead us, maybe it's my turn now to do the same."
"116521668-0-5398";"A hunter with the heart of Ysgramor! Here's the coin I promised. I'll sing your praises next time I see the inside of a mead hall.\n\nDon't worry about me. I know the way back to town, wound or no wound."
"116521668-0-5400";"A Covenant contract? I smell a distraction. That ship we spotted might be the start of an invasion.\n\nWe've got to get back to the village!"
"116521668-0-5401";"May your scales stay moist. By the way, we're not heading back to the village. We have our own boat, and we're getting off this cursed rock.\n\nIf you're ever in Davon's Watch, you should consider joining the guild. I'd put in a good word for you."
"116521668-0-5409";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-5413";"We sprint. If we act quickly, we might be able to alert Davon's Watch before the Covenant ships arrive.\n\nYou ready?"
"116521668-0-5414";"The Covenant? Here? Troll's blood! I have to warn the village.\n\nI'll head back. See if you can find any of the other villagers on the island. We may have to evacuate soon."
"116521668-0-5415";"Yes. You've done as we agreed. Take this for your work.\n\nNow you will leave. Immediately. The secrets of the Spinner's shrine are not for outsiders."
"116521668-0-5417";"Kyne's gift! We'll head back to the village right now. Rana's going to flay his fool hide! I can't properly repay you, but please, take this. It was our mother's."
"116521668-0-5419";"I can't believe any of this. He wouldn't betray us. Would he?\n\nThank you for your help, but I need to be alone."
"116521668-0-5421";"I don't know what we'd have done, living out the rest of our lives as cheese-eating rodents. Yech!\n\nIf I ever find that mage, I'm going to show him what it means to be vermin!"
"116521668-0-5427";"Shor's bones! Thank you! I'd like to kill every one of those bandits, but I'm no fighter. I'm glad you are!\n\nKill a few for Dedring. I'll buy you a drink back at the village."
"116521668-0-5429";"You've passed the challenges of the Mad God, restored me to sanity, and reclaimed this sanctuary for the Mages Guild. Somehow, my thanks seem small in comparison. But you have them. Thank you, adept. For all you've done."
"116521668-0-5430";"Just give me a second, and I'll head back home. I'll lean on Rexus when I get tired. \n\n<<1>> will be worried sick. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-5442";"I just wish we could have done more.\n\nWell, then! Are you ready to get off this rock?"
"116521668-0-5477";"There's a necromancer here, but I can't find him. He must be in the catacombs beneath the shrine. That's the only place that makes sense."
"116521668-0-5478";"Thank you. I just hope we're not too late."
"116521668-0-5479";"That's refreshing. Most days, it's just Rana and me against the world. \n\nWe have some work to do."
"116521668-0-5480";"You're right. We can't wait any longer.\n\nVivec preserve us all."
"116521668-0-5483";"The giants are mine to control! No one will dare cause trouble for Lower Yorgrim now that we have our own herd of giants!\n\nThank you for your help. If you ever want to share a meal, just stop by the manor."
"116521668-0-5490";"We did, thanks to you. We are forever in your debt. \n\nWe will think of you always in our passage down the river."
"116521668-0-5491";"They've gone to war. \n\nAnd they're outnumbered. I fear everyone we know will be dead before the day is out."
"116521668-0-5492";"You did, guar-friend! They're all back. <<1>> is already ruling the roost. \n\nWhere would they be without me? I'll get them fed and ready to carry our things."
"116521668-0-5496";"Damn their hides, yes! <<1>> is still in Pact hands. \n\nThe refugees wouldn't have made it without you. I hate to think what must have happened at the docks."
"116521668-0-5499";"The Keepers teach us it is an honor to die defending our homeland. That's what they preach.\n\nForsaking the teachings of Kyne dishonors us all!"
"116521668-0-5501";"It's like the sun on your scales, isn't it? We almost lost these docks. All these people would have died without your intervention.\n\nThank you. Saving lives is never a small victory."
"116521668-0-5504";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-5508";"Excellent, yes? I'll let the commanders here know of our success.\n\nI hope we'll see each other again. Stay moist."
"116521668-0-5509";"You really can't hold your mead. Roruld's latest batch must have been pretty potent!\n\nThe Voljar name has always stood for fine mead. In memory of my wife, we plan to continue that tradition. Thanks for your help."
"116521668-0-5511";"It might be ugly, but nothing says security like an Orc's head on a pike. \n\nHaraldar will be pleased that I … um, that we … took care of Kazok. It's small comfort for the loss of his wife, but he'll appreciate anything that helps the meadery."
"116521668-0-5519";"A few. We scattered. Some barred themselves inside, but the Daggers put everything to the torch.\n\nIf it wasn't for that crazy Dark Elf, I'd be fattening fish."
"116521668-0-5520";"It's going to be a long day, my friend. \n\nGet ready for some dirty work."
"116521668-0-5525";"Thank you. Some of Lower Yorgrim's refugees will sleep warmly tonight.\n\nPlease, take this for your troubles."
"116521668-0-5548";"That's a start. A good start. The Shadowed Path is always recruiting new scum to fill their ranks, but you've weakened them for now. I appreciate it."
"116521668-0-5557";"Yes, soldier. Thank you. We're giving the Covenant a good fight. \n\nWithout your warning, Davon's Watch would be in their hands. Feels good to save a city, doesn't it?"
"116521668-0-5558";"That's a relief! Dremora can't be killed, but you've banished her from our plane for a time; thanks to you we can breathe a little easier today."
"116521668-0-5561";"I feel so … violated. What that thing did to my soldiers … what it did to me! I may never sleep soundly again.\n\nThank you. If you hadn't come along … well, I don't even want to imagine."
"116521668-0-5564";"Droi's fate is in Kyne's hands, but his chances are better now. I'll continue to watch over him until he wakes up.\n\nSince he was here before us, it's possible that Droi knows what happened to the Keepers. We need to find out what he saw."
"116521668-0-5566";"Oh, I will. And the sooner I can rest and recover, the sooner I can head to the front line and fight for our king. That's where we all should be right now.\n\nHere, please take this. It was Droi's. He would want you to have it."
"116521668-0-5567";"We'll head back to Windhelm and rest before marching to join the rest of the army.\n\nTake this. It was a charm to bring me luck in the war. Thanks to you, my luck has been pretty good. I want you to have it."
"116521668-0-5571";"Cheating at the Konunleikar? And the Stormfist clan? They haven't caused this much trouble since ….\n\nOh, no. This is worse than I feared. We need to determine what's really going on here."
"116521668-0-5572";"You caused quite a stir. I'm impressed that you outraced our finest runners. You've done well for Windhelm and the Pact.\n\nSadly, Hadring was murdered during the race. Felled by a poisoned arrow of Orcish design. I'm sure the Stormfists are involved."
"116521668-0-5573";"Another blasted attack! You showed compassion, abandoning the race to aid another. Empathy is worth as much as strength, in my opinion.\n\nNow, about Hadring. We need to find his killers and bring them to justice."
"116521668-0-5574";"King Jorunn's exiled brother, Fildgor, used to run the Stormfist Brigade. That's his symbol, added to the Stormfist emblem. And these orders ….\n\nFildgor has returned to Skyrim! King Jorunn must be told. Hopefully, it's not too late."
"116521668-0-5575";"That's good to hear. You don't know how relieved I am by this news.\n\nYou risked your life, even though you had no duty to uphold or vow to keep. To me, that makes you the champion of the day."
"116521668-0-5582";"Let me look at those orders.\n\nI see. Those dogs came up through the crypts! That's how they surprised us. It says something here about their true prize being in the crypts below. I wonder what they could be after."
"116521668-0-5588";"That's a relief. Though necromancers sometimes come back from the dead, unfortunately. We'll keep an eye out for him from now on."
"116521668-0-5589";"I have little to offer by way of reward, other than my thanks. \n\nI doubt you'll remember two simple fishermen, but we'll never forget you."
"116521668-0-5593";"Good work. Bears just seem attracted to that area, for some reason. A new one will show up sooner or later. But at least we can add another bear-skin rug to the pile."
"116521668-0-5595";"Wonderful! The refugees will be delighted. I'll find out who these items belong to and hand them back."
"116521668-0-5596";"I received word that General Yeveth Noramil and Eyes-of-Steel will meet with me. I'll show them the respect they deserve and work to strengthen our alliance.\n\nOnce again, your aid advances our cause. You have my gratitude."
"116521668-0-5598";"Let me see their orders. Yes, yes. Very interesting. This is excellent work. Excellent!\n\nThe King, his son, and the other Pact leaders can safely focus on dealing with Orcthane Fildgor now, thanks to you."
"116521668-0-5599";"That was an admirable showing. Even in defeat, you represented Windhelm and the Pact with honor.\n\nSadly, Hadring was murdered during the race. Felled by a poisoned arrow of Orcish design. I'm convinced the Stormfists are responsible."
"116521668-0-5600";"Nothing I like more than the smell of dead Goblin. As long as we keep the Rock Bone numbers down, Vlastarus should be safe, from them at least."
"116521668-0-5602";"Keep the amulet. You earned it. And as long as you carry it, we will always be connected."
"116521668-0-5604";"By the Egg, that will show the pompous Elf. Vlastarus will never fly Dominion colors!"
"116521668-0-5606";"At last. It took you long enough, but at least you brought it back unharmed. I won't display this anymore, since it has proven so irresistible to thieves."
"116521668-0-5607";"Good, though it seems he never stays at rest. All I can do is continue to have him put down each time he arises. Something about that ancient ruin refuses to let the dead lie in peace."
"116521668-0-5608";"You don't trust me. I understand that and I don't blame you. A vampire helping strangers at an isolated manor house. What's not suspicious about that?\n\nLike I said, I need your help. And you may not know it yet, but you need mine."
"116521668-0-5610";"That's all you need to know for now. You'll learn more as you use them. \n\nSeveral of the Pact military leaders are stationed here. Speak with them and they will give you your first real assignment. Welcome to the War."
"116521668-0-5612";"That took far too long!  But thank you for bringing back what is rightfully mine."
"116521668-0-5613";"Good. Make sure the way is clear for our assault. Speak to General Noramil. He's been coordinating our efforts to scout the area for another way in.\n\nThe Ebonheart Pact stands together to defeat the Orcthane!"
"116521668-0-5622";"Magrus surely watched over you among those dangerous ruins. I worried that I'd never see this crystal again.\n\nThank you for your bravery and willingness to help in our time of need."
"116521668-0-5624";"We should leave this place. With the Daedra banished, the glen will collapse in upon itself. Thank you for all you've done!\n\nUm … I hope you'll have the good taste to not mention that I was involved in all this."
"116521668-0-5625";"Excellent! Just what Nayya asked for, though I wouldn't be surprised if she says she needs more.\n\nHere is your payment, as promised."
"116521668-0-5627";"The people who did this to me will pay!"
"116521668-0-5637";"Excellent! We couldn't have gathered this information without you. Now, with your continued help, we can take back Cradlecrush and drive off the Stormfist invaders."
"116521668-0-5639";"Excellent! We're holding things down as best we can here, but we need to move quickly. I fear the usurper is close to achieving his goal."
"116521668-0-5641";"I've heard that name before, I think. But it fades when I try to remember, like a bad dream.\n\nStill, gloomy thoughts do not become us now! The spinners will sing your story with gusto! A tale of harrowing adventure, and wealth beyond measure!"
"116521668-0-5642";"Well done! Once banished, the Dremora will never be able to return to Nirn. \n\nThank you for your assistance. I hope this ritual will somehow make amends for my part in this whole sordid affair."
"116521668-0-5644";"Joyous news! The Green Lady must hear of this. I sent a Jaqspur scout to her when <<1>> returned, and now we must send another with this report.\n\nYou've done us a service, and have our deepest gratitude."
"116521668-0-5646";"It's my duty. Her spirit will linger a little while longer, along with the Oathbreakers disturbed by the Worm Cult. I'll have to use that time to learn as much as I can.\n\nOnce the cultists leave, all of the spirits can enjoy their endless rest again."
"116521668-0-5647";"You've broken their power here. They may find another way, but we will be ready for them this time.\n\nFor now, we must rest. Thank you for aiding us, though we are outcast. Perhaps we will meet again."
"116521668-0-5650";"I know. I felt his life force depart when you struck him down. Go in peace, Giant-Friend. You have our thanks."
"116521668-0-5658";"<You spot a small pouch beside Lothgar's body.>"
"116521668-0-5676";"Believe me, you won't regret this.\n\nPoor Scales burns with the blood fever. She'll be trying to eat every face she sees soon enough. Who would wish that fate upon her? Well, I suppose my father would, but you'll learn more about him shortly."
"116521668-0-5678";"Raynor sent you? Well, that was nice of him since it's his fault I'm stuck down here! His stupid invisibility device stopped working and now the constructs won't stop chasing me!\n\nAnyway, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-5682";"Hey, I had everything under control until … no, you're right. I don't have the best track record. I keep needing help.\n\nMaybe the Mages Guild will teach us how to be proper adventurers. Or Shad Astula. We should be able to write our own ticket now!"
"116521668-0-5683";"You really think so? She has been talking about how stuffy the mages are. How they'd hamper our creativity. It's just … hard to let go, I guess.\n\nWell, I guess this is exciting. And thanks for all your help, by the way. I really appreciate it."
"116521668-0-5685";"We will leave this place. Losing Rala … I see now that my friends aren't ready to be on their own.\n\nI'll continue to train those new to this life. Temper them. Teach them not to succumb to the maddening bloodlust."
"116521668-0-5686";"I give you this as payment for services rendered. You are strong and I respect that.\n\nFeel free to visit as often as you like. I shall happily provide you with power whenever you wish."
"116521668-0-5701";"I'll make sure of it. Thanks to you, Rilis will never see Tamriel again.\n\nThe situation would be dire had he escaped to the surface."
"116521668-0-5705";"We will go somewhere safe—a place where we won't be a danger to others.\n\nMy friends still have much to learn. I can't risk others until I know they can control their temptations. No one will fall victim to our people again."
"116521668-0-5711";"What? That ship was our home. All of our props and supplies are in the Shrikes' hands now.\n\nIt'll be tough going for a while, no doubt about that!"
"116521668-0-5712";"I heard Southpoint's been quiet lately. Maybe we'll drop in and liven things up a bit!\n\nNext show is free for you, though. We'll remember your face, don't worry!"
"116521668-0-5716";"You would do this? And for a man you barely know? Your life could be forfeited by doing this.\n\nVery well. The decision is yours. I can use what remains of the Dreamwalker's magic to send you into the Dreamstride. From there you will be on your own."
"116521668-0-5717";"Fildgor has forced his way into Sovngarde. He is close to accomplishing his goal. Soon he shall steal my essence and convince the Crown of Freydis to accept him.\n\nPlease! You must stop him!"
"116521668-0-5719";"My uncle lives? My father's mercy knows no bounds! \n\nYou've been by his side and have persevered when others would have faltered. From now on, you shall be known as the High King's Arrow, for you lead the way and always strike true."
"116521668-0-5720";"Fildgor's dead? Then the villain has paid for his crimes. \n\nYou've been by my father's side and have persevered when others would have faltered. From now on, you shall be known as the High King's Arrow, for you lead the way and always strike true."
"116521668-0-5725";"Then the draugr should slowly return to their graves. In the meantime, we'll stay in here until they go away.\n\nI curse the Covenant for what it's done. Thank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-5731";"Well. They'll be stuck in there for Y'ffre knows how long. At least the sphere's safe from the Sea Vipers.\n\nThe stormwardens won't forget your help. May the storm travel before you, as they say."
"116521668-0-5734";"Fildgor and his Stormfist Brigade have gone to the dragonshrine of Skuldafn. The Prince and I must go to the camps at the foot of the mountain and plan our counter move.\n\nI need to leave now. The people need their King."
"116521668-0-5736";"I will be. It seems I can only trust you and my last ambassador. I must get to the town of Silvenar, and the Green Lady, quickly.\n\nAs soon as my magicka returns, we'll be on our way."
"116521668-0-5742";"The mine is as good as ours again, thanks to you!\n\nI could use your help against the Stormfist leader, though."
"116521668-0-5746";"Thanks. I'm grateful that the mine is once again safely under our control.\n\nI sure would like to learn more about this mysterious metal, though."
"116521668-0-5748";"Those Worms! Trying to enslave my spirit, then sacrifice me to enhance Sinmur's powers. A foolish plan, attempted by idiots. Even you were able to defeat them!\n\nThat shard is mine, by the way."
"116521668-0-5753";"Good work! With that manifest, the Maormer could've intercepted our supply ships, and taken arms intended for the Dominion forces.\n\nThey'll regret this assault. We don't take such affronts lightly."
"116521668-0-5754";"With this group? Without a doubt! We'll make our way overland to Vulkwasten.\n\nWe'd have been lost without you, and the Maormer would know our secrets. This rescue brings great honor to your name, my friend. May Auri-El guide you."
"116521668-0-5755";"Good. I lit up a few of the rowboats myself.\n\nA job well-done, but don't let it go to your head. It'll take the Maormer a while to recover, but they will. We must be vigilant."
"116521668-0-5760";"Help my family any way you can.\n\nThey'll need it without me around."
"116521668-0-5765";"Drunk? No! Just checking the jagga. For bruising, you know? Rotmeth's the real prize, though. Thank you for finding it! I'll have some of the workers bring it home.\n\nI thank you. My ancestors thank you. We all thank you! Here's to your success!"
"116521668-0-5766";"A shard of Wuuthrad. Here? You must be joking. Though, from the look on your face, I see you're not. \n\nThe Worm Cult is a danger to us all. We'll double patrols with the five men we have. In the meantime, thank you for running them out of town."
"116521668-0-5778";"Every tale has an end. Every end allows a beginning to set hold. It is a balance, tenuous though it seems to be.\n\nZ'en's presence fades from this world as Mauloch grows stronger. Perhaps these journals will give comfort to those who fear the end."
"116521668-0-5780";"With this, the rotmeth will turn out great! A pity to lose all that ice, but to be honest … the atronach always gives me the chills. Just standing there. Watching.\n\nWe'll make do with the cave. What was good for our parents is good for us, eh?"
"116521668-0-5783";"Hardly a scratch! I still don't have any idea what to make of this ore, but the residual dust could be useful. \n\nI'll go up to the mine and talk to Jomund. I need more samples. This dust may be valuable, even if I don't fully understand it yet."
"116521668-0-5784";"And you turned the tide and cut off the head of the worm! Without Thallik Wormfather, the cult will be severely weakened.\n\nThanks to you, I now see victory on the horizon."
"116521668-0-5785";"Yes, my friend. We have. Families across the Pact-lands will rest easier tonight thanks to you."
"116521668-0-5788";"I think we'll be fine. Maybe we'll be a little more diligent about guard duty. We don't want to get caught unawares again! \n\nThanks for all your help."
"116521668-0-5789";"Please, enjoy the hospitality of Silvenar for as long as you like … though I am certain your tale will draw you away from us soon.\n\nMay your story be neverending, and always of interest."
"116521668-0-5790";"The celebrations last several days. You should stay and listen to us! We don't all know the same songs yet, but our performance will never be forgotten.\n\nSee you there!"
"116521668-0-5791";"I knew it wasn't my imagination! She must need something to cling to.\n\nI'm here, my lady. I will protect you."
"116521668-0-5797";"No. With my shackles destroyed and the cult's ritual disrupted, I am free. \n\nThey wished to enslave me, to use me to strengthen the giant Sinmur. I will aid you in your quest against the foul Worms."
"116521668-0-5806";"After that story, I think I might be the one who needs a drink! Well, thanks for the information. I'll make sure to look into these accusations as soon as I can.\n\nBut you're not going to give up on this, are you?"
"116521668-0-5807";"Nonsense. You worry too much, my friend. This is going to be the best Corn-loon-licker ever!\n\nNow please take this. It's a gift for all your hard work. Rigurt insists!"
"116521668-0-5816";"That's the deed all right. I didn't think I liked you when I met you, but you've grown on me.\n\nNow to deal with the hole the kwama dug. There's some kind of Dwemer ruin down there. This whole affair might turn out better than I thought it would."
"116521668-0-5821";"I will enter the city and find a safe place to store the Egg. Then I will enjoy the celebration.\n\nThe Nords know how to keep the cold at bay. It's my favorite thing about them."
"116521668-0-5826";"And I spoke to Prince Irnskar. He agrees that he might have been a little arrogant. Especially when I told him what you discovered.\n\nMaybe now we can all get back to the business at hand instead of just throwing insults at each other."
"116521668-0-5827";"Death was a just punishment for my crimes. The <<1>> released my spirit when that barrier fell.\n\nThe Worm Cult failed to summon Mauloch, thanks to you. And now, I am free. Safe journeys, my friend!"
"116521668-0-5828";"Khanni thanks you for saving her soul from that prison. No treasure can repay you for my freedom."
"116521668-0-5831";"Yes, yes. I'm thankful for these wounds, in fact. They woke me up. A thane must be ever vigilant.\n\nThe Worms will find no shelter in the shadows of Nimalten."
"116521668-0-5843";"I'd slit his throat right now if I could, but there's no time … not with the dead on our doorstep.\n\nDeal with the dead. Stop the attack. After that, we'll expose Thorulf for what he is!"
"116521668-0-5846";"Unusual, but not unworkable.\n\nShandi will make this less edible and more readable. Thank you for your gift!"
"116521668-0-5851";"I'll spend the rest of my life atoning for my crimes. Starting with telling my traveling companions the truth about my past. If I'm shunned for my actions, so be it.\n\nThank you for giving me a chance to start over."
"116521668-0-5856";"I don't care if the Eight themselves sent you. If you're here to help, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-5857";"Did he mention the finder's fee he receives for sending you into the swamp? Of course not.\n\nSince he didn't, I'll provide you with his fee directly. Hand it to him the next time you see him, or use it for a pair of watertight boots."
"116521668-0-5859";"Because of you, I've finally joined my sisters. I feel like we're old friends already.\n\nPerhaps the four of us can heal the spriggans and drive the Worm Cult away for good. It'd be like being the Green Lady once again!"
"116521668-0-5865";"Then we are allies. For now.\n\nI must go to my father. I don't care how we do it, but his life must be saved. My father can't die. Fildgor will not win this war! Not this way! I forbid it!"
"116521668-0-5872";"You … you're a hero to honest businessmen everywhere. I'll teach my children songs about you! Look at Turil glowering. I hope he gets a disease and drowns in his own fluids."
"116521668-0-5873";"Did … did you notice that? Just now, as you handed me the silk. The sun shone through the clouds. Thank you. And look at Enthis over there. May he suffocate beneath a pile of mammoth dung."
"116521668-0-5880";"Recording your deeds here will be my first act as Sage of Fallowstone Hall. The Companions will recover from this setback. Vigrod and I will make sure of it."
"116521668-0-5885";"Right. He's mine to deal with, and I will. As for you, you saved my hall. I owe you.\n\nI want you to keep Bonebane, use it as I did. My adventuring days are over. As for this cursed shard, Hallfrida will keep it safe until you need it again."
"116521668-0-5886";"I'll keep it safe until you need it. You have my word as Thane of Fullhelm.\n\nIf not for you, we'd all be dead. It's a debt I can't repay, but you can start by keeping Bonebane. Use it like my grandfather did. Make these Worm Cult bastards bleed."
"116521668-0-5889";"I never had a chance. They drugged us. Then the Hagraven came. Its breath on my face! It sucked out my eyes. I'll never see again."
"116521668-0-5891";"I'll never regain my eyesight, but I'll live. Porath will see me back to Shor's Stone. Come see me, if you ever return."
"116521668-0-5896";"Then by all means, let me have it.\n\nExcellent! The fort is back under our control, thanks to you. You've made quite a name for yourself amongst our soldiers, friend. Lieutenant Koruni, in particular, seems suitably impressed with your efforts."
"116521668-0-5899";"There's a necromancer here, but I can't find him. He must be in the catacombs beneath the shrine. That's the only place that makes sense."
"116521668-0-5900";"Perhaps if my brother is still alive. I just hope it's not too late."
"116521668-0-5901";"That's refreshing. Most days, it's just Rana and me against the world. \n\nWe have some work to do."
"116521668-0-5902";"That's refreshing. Most days, it's just Rana and me against the world. \n\nWe have some work to do."
"116521668-0-5903";"The wilderness is just too dangerous for us. I'm never leaving town again!"
"116521668-0-5928";"It is. And your arrival is not unexpected."
"116521668-0-5931";"I'm glad you've come. Help is vital at this time of crisis."
"116521668-0-5932";"And not a moment too soon. \n\nWe can't wait for more reinforcements. We must strike back against these bastards before we lose our chance."
"116521668-0-5933";"Excellent! You've cleared the pass for us. I'm moving our troops forward now."
"116521668-0-5935";"Yes. As Ysgramor said, their masters reside in Coldharbour. We have no choice but to invade.\n \nI must return to Mournhould, my friend. I hope to see you there."
"116521668-0-5936";"I'll make sure the families of the fallen get these. It should give them some closure at least."
"116521668-0-5952";"The ones in Colovia wait for a reply from the Gold Coast mercenaries. When they do not get one, they will send another courier, forewarned of treachery.\n\nLet us make sure none are left to answer the next message, shall we?"
"116521668-0-5953";"I couldn't wait for them. Ran ahead, too far ahead. Impatience. My curse! The captain … if she's alive ….\n\n<<1>>'s in charge. She's got to … to save Velyn Harbor now."
"116521668-0-5954";"I have never been so grateful for it to be business as usual. Travelers will come again. We will flourish.\n\nWherever you go, you may meet one of our kind. And we will know your name as a friend, a friend of the Baandari."
"116521668-0-5955";"My job. We were sent here to escort the Green Lady, but the town's defenses will need a bit of work first.\n\nI'm sure our paths will cross again someday."
"116521668-0-5956";"Just you? I hope you're tougher than you look. Sorry. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but we're in trouble out here."
"116521668-0-5957";"Maybe I will … but don't be too insistent about that.\n\nKeep your curiosity to yourself. Better to stay silent and be thought a fool than to speak carelessly and have your throat cut."
"116521668-0-5959";"Shor's Bones! I'm glad to hear that. On both counts! I wasn't looking forward to going up there. The mountain has a terrible reputation. I'll take the shard back to Riften and keep it safe until you need it."
"116521668-0-5963";"And for that, we thank you. \n\nWith their queen destroyed the other lamia will flee, and balance will return to these ruins. In time, all will be well again."
"116521668-0-5967";"The Dreamwalker is already inside. Let the monks know you bring the ritual components. \n\nI must be off. Fildgor is on the run and we're closing in. Now go. Save the King so he can lead us to victory."
"116521668-0-5971";"Yes! This is going to be epic, my friends. Epic!"
"116521668-0-5972";"Then I'm glad you didn't give in to Dralof. I certainly don't want to turn into a zombie. That would be icky.\n\nHere, take this for your time. I really appreciate not getting zombified, if you know what I mean."
"116521668-0-5983";"They are safe. Trolls still roam the area, but they will get bored and wander off when the food runs out. Hopefully, they won't look in this cave.\n\nWe are in your debt. My skills are yours, should you ever need them."
"116521668-0-5985";"We haven't spoken in years. As much as I would wish otherwise, I know what I have to do.\n\nThank you. My mother is smiling in Sovngarde today."
"116521668-0-5990";"We'll be a long time in rebuilding, but your bravery won't be forgotten."
"116521668-0-5992";"<Inside Hadmal's chest, you find his most prized possession.>"
"116521668-0-6009";"That's a relief. Thank you. Now comes the tricky bit. \n\nThe final ritual must take place inside the ancestral tombs. Where, I would imagine, the most powerful dead dwell."
"116521668-0-6010";"Fine. You win. But as soon as you leave Eastmarch, I'll be the best hunter here again."
"116521668-0-6011";"We'll head to Vulkhel Guard and return with reinforcements. By this time tomorrow, South Beacon will be ours again and the invaders will be nothing but a bad memory. \n\nWe couldn't have done this without your help. You won't be forgotten."
"116521668-0-6012";"All that remains is to tend to the wounded. And continue the research. With the Mora in hand and Uricantar dead, Ezduiin will soon be at peace. \n\nI'll see to it."
"116521668-0-6013";"Yes, can't you feel it? \n\nThe spirits still remain, but in time they will learn they are free to move on."
"116521668-0-6021";"My father was a traitor to the crown? Orchestrated an assault on his own people? \n\nWhy? Why would you do this, father?"
"116521668-0-6022";"We'll gear up and patch our wounds. In the meantime, find out who's behind this conspiracy. \n\nI'll send one of my best men along with you, to help loosen some tongues. Stars guide your steps."
"116521668-0-6023";"Ah! Vulkhel Guard, of course. Welcome to Tanzelwil. Perhaps you'll get through to Her Majesty where we could not."
"116521668-0-6027";"You're too modest. Thank you, my brave and noble friend.\n\nUntil we meet again, wherever the road may take us."
"116521668-0-6032";"You've done it! The madness has left them, and the Ancestral Spirits are at peace.\n\nI can still sense residual necromantic energy, so be careful. The stones were powerful. We may feel their influence for some time to come."
"116521668-0-6042";"Urgent news, eh? Perhaps it'll take her mind off the troubles. Been enough of that lately!"
"116521668-0-6043";"Their souls are with Akatosh now and at peace. I wish we could have given them a proper burial, but this will have to do.\n\nBless you, friend, for saving them from a fate I would not wish on anyone."
"116521668-0-6048";"Well, that's a start. Maybe my friends will rest more peacefully now. I like the way you work!"
"116521668-0-6053";"You've lightened my heart, friend. Akatosh's blessings upon you!"
"116521668-0-6055";"Indeed! Well, perhaps my time is not yet at an end here. I cannot leave such a phenomenon undocumented.\n\nThank you for your aid in uncovering these creatures. Their suffering is regrettable, but I will see to it that it is not forgotten."
"116521668-0-6091";"I'll stay here until you return, but please, hurry!"
"116521668-0-6092";"You're probably right. This place doesn't feel right. \n\nI'll be outside, waiting for news of my husband. Please, hurry!"
"116521668-0-6093";"I'm glad we understand each other, outsider. \n\nIt's a shame we didn't reach this understanding earlier. We might have spared your friend. Can you smell the cinnamon aroma? She was a woman of undeniably good taste."
"116521668-0-6094";"It's true, then. He's gone forever. I didn't want to believe it.\n\nI'd have never known the truth if it weren't for you. Wherever he rests in the world beyond this one, he rests peacefully. Thank you."
"116521668-0-6095";"Isn't it obvious? You left your friend here in the camp, unguarded, and now she's nowhere to be found. \n\nShe was obviously a woman of good taste. Cinnamon, to be specific. And my people were so very hungry."
"116521668-0-6096";"I know. Ever since that bandit raid that separated us, I knew.\n\nBut I must thank you, sera. You helped me persue my foolish hope, even at your own risk. You let me forget what I already knew. I had seen my Garil for the last time."
"116521668-0-6097";"Oh, you're a priest now? Morally superior? To Oblivion with you! You know, I may just buy Turil a drink. Yes. Have a little chat about who's going to stab you to death!"
"116521668-0-6098";"Just, just stop talking. I can't bear the sound of your voice. It's time I put aside this feud with Enthis. It's clear we have much in common, such as hiring assassins to stab silk-rippers to death!"
"116521668-0-6124";"I can finally go home. I'm going to crawl into my hut and sleep until the start of the next age. \n\nI'll never forget what you did for me, provided I remember any of this when I wake up."
"116521668-0-6125";"Lucius was a good friend, the bravest among us. Akatosh grant his soul peace.\n\nHe would be glad to know you completed the delivery. Here, take the payment he would have received for the supplies."
"116521668-0-6137";"Thank Akatosh! With a lich to lead them, the Shadowed Path evil could spread unchecked. We will keep an eye on those ruins henceforth."
"116521668-0-6153";"Well done! I hope that gives us a respite from their attacks, for a while at least.\n\nYour efforts on our behalf are greatly appreciated."
"116521668-0-6156";"Our investigation is just beginning. I hope the elder Pellingare isn't implicated, as well.\n\nToday is a dark one for our city. But it would've been worse if you hadn't gotten involved."
"116521668-0-6159";"Thanks. We'll see how long she stays down this time. She never seems to stay dead for very long.\n\nI appreciate the effort though!"
"116521668-0-6161";"Jakaral. The skalds! They're trapped. Trapped in the giant camp!"
"116521668-0-6164";"Yup. I'll let Vofknir know.\n\nGood work."
"116521668-0-6165";"Yes, that's it! Well done indeed. I'll pass the word to Vofknir at once.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me."
"116521668-0-6166";"Oh, aye. You did great. Just great! \n\nI'll let Vofknir know about your luminous inner spirit. Good luck in the rest of your journey!"
"116521668-0-6167";"We'll toast your name tonight, my new champion. I hope you'll stay and enjoy the mead. And the feasting. And the dancing!\n\nOh, oh, oh! And don't forget—the singing!"
"116521668-0-6168";"You can hold your drink, and you sing like a bird. Geirmund would be proud!"
"116521668-0-6169";"The shard enabled Gullveig to devour souls and ascend into lich form. I'll keep the shard safe from now on.\n\nYou saved our lives and prevented evil from spreading out of Lost Prospect. I hope to return the favor someday."
"116521668-0-6175";"Excellent! My Lord Sanguine will be pleased. \n\nYou have the stench of Molag Bal upon you, but you did as I asked. Thank you, mortal."
"116521668-0-6176";"We storm the castle and the realm beyond. This one imagines Estre is very upset. She threw in her lot with Dagon and now ….\n\nNow nothing stands in our way."
"116521668-0-6181";"Among those who heed my voice, you will be honored and welcome. Our alliance of three peoples is fragile but beautiful.\n\nWith you at its heart, I'm certain the Covenant and the Pact will learn to fear the eagle's cry."
"116521668-0-6183";"Good. Thinning their numbers keeps them under control, as much as anything is under control around here."
"116521668-0-6191";"In some cases I'm taking a preventative stance. Hopefully that will stop the spread of the disease. \n\nThe gods thank you. As do I."
"116521668-0-6195";"Ha! They'll think twice before trying to ambush me again, thanks to you. Keep whatever you found on their bodies, and take this as well."
"116521668-0-6197";"My men and I will go round him up. I can't believe we took a contract from a damned deathlover.\n\nThank you, traveler. Stars guide your steps."
"116521668-0-6198";"A package from Bar-Neeus? Is it revenge?\n\nBut no—it's supplies and gold. He has shamed me! I'll take his gift for my family, but I'll never forgive him for it!"
"116521668-0-6202";"Of course, gladly. And you have the enduring friendship of the Rothalen family. Let us never speak of this incident again."
"116521668-0-6211";"Exploding arrows? They really worked? That's cheating! I knew I should have disqualified them when I had the chance.\n\nA bet's a bet, though. Take your winnings and go gloat somewhere else."
"116521668-0-6214";"I appreciate it. Those supply caches are worth more than gold to me. Take this in thanks."
"116521668-0-6215";"Sanessalmo? Now that name I remember. Used to be a member of the Queen's inner circle! \n\nYou have my deepest gratitude for your service today. I'll be sure the Queen learns of your bravery."
"116521668-0-6218";"As am I, my friend. But there is much to do. \n\nThe Worms hide inside Trolhetta. Mark my words—Mannimarco's spawn dies today."
"116521668-0-6220";"Now you understand. I've read those two silly books over and over again.\n\nI think I'll stay right where I am, though. Better than world you know then the world you don't. You should be on your way."
"116521668-0-6223";"Another mouth to feed and house. You'd better be good!"
"116521668-0-6224";"<You add the names ""Linele Skullcarver"" and ""Lolann"" to Aera's logbook. The book includes the names of many Worm Cult members Aera has brought to justice.\n\nInterestingly, all of them have died either during their arrest or soon after.>"
"116521668-0-6226";"A Flame Atronach. My spell should have sent it screaming back to Oblivion.\n\nBut something else interfered."
"116521668-0-6227";"I can't believe—that little fool! With the Queen traveling the countryside! Do you have any idea what could happen if word that the Grove trucks with Daedra gets out?\n\nIf this is true, Merormo must die."
"116521668-0-6232";"I have his book! I mean … the library has his book! Wait a minute. He said what? In a graveyard? Daedric poetry? You're kidding!\n\nHe's not what I thought he was. Thank you for opening my eyes."
"116521668-0-6234";"Poor <<1>>. I wondered what became of him after Sinmur attacked Riften.\n\nThank you. It's a relief to know at last."
"116521668-0-6250";"I … don't know for sure. I'm not sure which would cause my mother less pain.\n\nI'll stay until she gets better. And … the others deserve to know what I've done. I won't run like a coward. I won't be like my father."
"116521668-0-6252";"I never meant for anyone to get hurt. And the lesson here is clear—Daedra are never the answer. I'll never attempt this kind of ritual again.\n\nYou probably hear this kind of thing all the time. But again, thank you, traveler."
"116521668-0-6256";"We'll need it."
"116521668-0-6257";"That's a relief. Now to give Harnald a piece of my mind!"
"116521668-0-6270";"Ha! Such is life, my friend. <<1>> and I will make other arrangements eventually.\n\nAnd <<2>> won't get his hands on my treasure, gold or otherwise. That works for me."
"116521668-0-6274";"She told us everything you did for her. Glad to hear you got that murdering Dunmer. \n\nTake this as a reward for saving my niece and solving the murders."
"116521668-0-6278";"I was right about you. You've been strong enough to help me see my own weakness.\n\nWell. Back to work then. I'm sure I'll be able to find a way."
"116521668-0-6281";"I hope my sisters fared as well on their missions."
"116521668-0-6282";"The time to stay in the shadows is past. Now we step into the light."
"116521668-0-6283";"You're right. On behalf of the Queen, we give you thanks. \n\nOne day you will be a great and mighty agent. Almost as great as Razum-dar. If that's possible."
"116521668-0-6284";"And you, my new friend. Without you, Moroth would have been dragged back to Orsinium in chains.\n\nWalk with Mauloch. And may your kills be swift."
"116521668-0-6295";"I cannot foresee that. Not yet. But we will meet again. There is still much we need to accomplish."
"116521668-0-6300";"I return to my work. The corruption fades, and the penitents will need guidance now more than ever. \n\nYou, gods-touched. You must seek and stop the blasphemer. Her profanity must be ended."
"116521668-0-6301";"Thank you! Thank you, so much! I'll just … I'll just gather my wits and then pack these out of here.\n\nBlessings of the Divines be upon you."
"116521668-0-6303";"Good call. We'll see that this man is taken to a cell. With respect, of course."
"116521668-0-6304";"Excellent! By what power I hold, I name you an agent in my employ. You are now an Eye of the Queen, bonded to my service.\n\nAuri-El keep you safe and Xarxes guard your words."
"116521668-0-6306";"Yes. Without the Spirit Healer's control, the giants will no longer seek us out. I extend my gratitude."
"116521668-0-6308";"I disenchanted it. The second blade in ""Two-Blades"" refers to my magic.\n\nI don't always get to put it to use, but I'd prefer not trying that again. Fortunately for us, you were here to handle Theran."
"116521668-0-6324";"Dead, eh? I hope he squealed like a pig. Nice work. Here's yer payoff. \n\nBut if I hear that Varnedo's still alive, I'll hunt you down and carve yer ears off!"
"116521668-0-6330";"What a relief! I can't tell you how good it feels to see <<1>> back in its rightful place."
"116521668-0-6331";"<<1>>! How can I ever thank you?"
"116521668-0-6334";"Excellent work. Being in the Eyes isn't always about high profile hijinks, eh?\n\nStill, I think you'll agree. Even support can be rewarding. Thank you, my new friend."
"116521668-0-6336";"Wish I could have helped. But I had to, you know, guard the portal and everything."
"116521668-0-6359";"You have no idea. I hope to never see another dead thing for as long as I live."
"116521668-0-6363";"Let's get back to the party. First round's on me. \n\nHa! Poured all over me, more like!"
"116521668-0-6364";"You've no idea. I'll take them from here. Thanks for keeping them safe. Good to know not everyone in this country is defenseless."
"116521668-0-6365";"We are free! Go in peace with our blessing."
"116521668-0-6369";"<Malsia doesn't respond. It seems her fears have come to fruition—her soul has been torn from her body.>"
"116521668-0-6370";"You did? I have to go see him!\n\nAnd, thank you. I can't ever possibly repay you."
"116521668-0-6373";"Well, you know. Goblins, giants—they're all great big beasts to little me.\n\nBut what's important is you saved me. My hero! Thank you so very much. Here, have some coins."
"116521668-0-6374";"Ha! That'd do it for most around here. Polish their egos to a fine sheen.\n\nRelatives of one of Nilwen's victims went looking for her a few months ago, three big Nord men. They turned up in the river, slit from ear to ear."
"116521668-0-6378";"Glowflies? Sure, hand 'em here. I could use these. Nothing is biting today.\n\nHere's some coin for your trouble. Just a little trouble warrants just a little coin, I reckon."
"116521668-0-6379";"I did nothing. She was planning to betray you from the start.\n\nBut you, I can't control. It's as if you don't have a proper soul. What a pair we are! Me trapped in my crown, you trapped in your soulless husk. I hope you're better company than Ulfnir."
"116521668-0-6390";"<<1>>! Yes, it's one of the relics the Reach stole from us during their raid. I never thought I'd see it again!"
"116521668-0-6397";"Leave these pigs to your slaughter. May they rot.\n\nThank you for your help. Shadowfen awaits!"
"116521668-0-6398";"At least he was slain by the sword of his father. In private, rather than in public by a hooded executioner.\n\nCold comfort. Thank you."
"116521668-0-6399";"A hundred years with the Marines and never before have I failed in my duty. Until today.\n\nI know myself, though. I would have come to regret killing Eranamo. Thank you."
"116521668-0-6404";"I was right about you. You're strong. But you can't bully me into forgetting what's important.\n\nIf you won't help me, I'll save Falinesti by myself!"
"116521668-0-6405";"Then … it's done. We've taken the school. We'll restart. We'll study to actually join the Thalmor. To put Bosmer and Khajiit in positions of power.\n\nThank you, my friend. The alliance is stronger for your courage."
"116521668-0-6409";"You've passed the first test of your initiation. Congratulations."
"116521668-0-6410";"Fjar? Really? I've known him for years, but I guess I didn't really know him at all. Makes me sad.\n\nThanks for your help. The Pact appreciates your loyalty."
"116521668-0-6411";"I'm impressed. Taking out those officers threw the Lion Guard camps into chaos. That gave our reinforcements the distraction they needed to surround the valley. It's all clean up from here on out.\n\nWe couldn't have done this without you."
"116521668-0-6412";"You fetcher! It was my idea!\n\nFine. I'll give it to Boril. I'm sure he'll pat me on the head for being so loyal and honest. Who needs all those annoying gold pieces cluttering up their purse, anyway?"
"116521668-0-6422";"Incredible. I knew you had potential, Gorak, but I never imagined you were so capable.\n\nThank you for your help, friend, though it sounds like Gorak didn't really need it."
"116521668-0-6423";"I see. Thank you for telling me the truth. \n\nNot only did Gorak do something incredibly stupid, but he lied to me about it, as well."
"116521668-0-6425";"I get to welcome you beneath the Veil. Do your damnedest to make the Veiled Queen proud."
"116521668-0-6426";"Oh yes, my friend. I hereby grant you special dispensation to investigate the villain Angof in my name. \n\nBut you must keep this quiet, for we don't want to tip our hand. I shall never forget your service this day, however."
"116521668-0-6427";"You felt the rumblings. Saw the darkness pouring from the ground. You tell me what that was.\n\nAll I know is <<1>> gave her life to save us from it. Don't waste her sacrifice."
"116521668-0-6429";"That was risky, yes? Let us hope nothing was broken.\n\nOur rewards await!"
"116521668-0-6430";"Truly, I am glad. She was very lonely, and for so long.\n\nBut enough melancholy, yes? To our spoils!"
"116521668-0-6436";"Who knows how long it will take the town to rebuild? But with the Marines at our backs, we cut them to ribbons. We've won the day. \n\nThank you. You've the thanks of a grateful Captain."
"116521668-0-6440";"So it was Hald? Damn. He was tortured years ago, in Daggerfall. I don't think he ever recovered. That's no excuse for treason, but it still makes me sad. \n\nThanks for your help. The Pact appreciates your loyalty."
"116521668-0-6441";"It figures Hilka was the traitor. You know she tried to punch me out once? Well, I'm not going to shed any tears.\n\nThanks to you, I have my scouts back, and you gave me the cover I needed to secure their exit. You're a credit to the Pact."
"116521668-0-6444";"My son sent you here? Where is he?\n\nWait, there's no time for that. We must act quickly. The Bloodthorn must be stopped."
"116521668-0-6446";"So I see. Sent the cultists right into our waiting blades. Good job!\n\nYou were right about that bandit. He really came through for us. We'll deal with the remaining cultists and their zombies."
"116521668-0-6447";"I hope it was worth it. Those Bloodthorn cultists will cause trouble elsewhere, no doubt.\n\nThere's some consolation that you stopped the necromantic ritual, however. We'll take care of the remaining cultists and their zombies."
"116521668-0-6450";"Ah, I thought he might be telling tall tales. Still, what Gorak did was brave. Stupid, but brave.\n\nThank you for finding Gorak, stranger. I shudder to think what those cultists would have done to him."
"116521668-0-6458";"Tamien, here? I hoped he would return.\n\nThere's no time for that right now, though. We need to act, before the Bloodthorn cultists cause more damage."
"116521668-0-6466";"She's a bit too obsessed with old Fahara'jad for me, but I like her style. Seeing as I need a new ship, gold will come in handy.\n\nI'm in. Can't let what you did for us go unrewarded. See you back in town."
"116521668-0-6480";"It's all right, my agent. You've done the Dominion a great service today. With Estre exposed, the Veil falls. We'll investigate her staff, her guards. We'll bring them to ground.\n\nYou have the thanks of a grateful Queen."
"116521668-0-6487";"You've saved my life.\n\nI spoke at length with that witch—with Drodda, before she cast me in ice. My family has caused her, and many of her kind, much grief. I will restore this Keep, but no more will it be a headquarters for witch-hunting."
"116521668-0-6493";"My crew. They got excited and rushed to grab the treasure. The gold—it turned them into skeletons!\n\nThen some kind of spectre appeared and ordered my own crew to attack me. I had to kill them, curse the luck."
"116521668-0-6495";"<Pinned to the bounty board is a note from General Thoron:>\n\n""I received word of your success, soldier. Accept this bonus pay. It has been well-earned!"""
"116521668-0-6510";"So you have chosen. So shall it be.\n\nYour allegiance has been pledged to Angof of the Reach."
"116521668-0-6512";"We'll just have to see, won't we?\n\nIn any case. For the lads and lasses here—thank you."
"116521668-0-6514";"Sadly, yes. The attack is underway."
"116521668-0-6526";"That's right. I'll collect Nelulin on the way out. I think maybe we'll retire to the countryside. \n\nThat sounds nice. Goodbye."
"116521668-0-6527";"You did what you could. I somehow knew it would end this way.\n\nThank you for listening to a mother's plea. I'd like to be alone now."
"116521668-0-6528";"I don't know. I'll go wherever I'm supposed to go, I guess. Wherever it is, it has to be better than here.\n\nThank you. Now, if you'll excuse me."
"116521668-0-6535";"So you have chosen. So shall it be.\n\nYour allegiance has been pledged to Thallik Wormtongue."
"116521668-0-6536";"So you have chosen. So shall it be.\n\nYour allegiance has been pledged to Kinlady Estre of the Summerset Isles."
"116521668-0-6557";"I have heard rumors of such a place. Just remember our agreement. Help me find a way to become what I once was and I will aid you against Molag Bal.\n\nI will find you in this city of yours soon enough."
"116521668-0-6567";"Estre. If only you'd arrived here sooner. It's a lesson I'll never forget. She decimated my town!\n\nIf you can help, please, speak to Landare."
"116521668-0-6568";"Yes, yes. We are here to gather some intelligence, right some wrongs. \n\nAnd perhaps slit some throats. We'll see how the day goes."
"116521668-0-6572";"Yes, I know you must have been concerned about the messenger. He made it through safely."
"116521668-0-6573";"We'll head out at once. That was where we were trying to go when we got separated from the others.\n\nI wish Angof the best. He really wasn't that bad. I think somewhere, deep inside, he remembered what it was like to be human."
"116521668-0-6574";"Yes, I know of it. My former master spoke of it once. How he hated the place!\n\nI'll make my way there. Come and get me when you're ready to actually do something significant."
"116521668-0-6575";"This one will find it. That was where we were headed when we got separated from the others.\n\nAt least I am no longer under the thumb of that horrible, horrible Breton!"
"116521668-0-6576";"I'll find this city of yours. I could do with a bath and a glass of fine wine. It's been far too long.\n\nJust remember our agreement. You help me, and I help you."
"116521668-0-6577";"That's the place we were trying to reach when the portal spit us in all directions.\n\nYou really are remarkable. I can't believe you actually won that twisted game. We'll see you in the city. Find us when you have need of our skills."
"116521668-0-6580";"You gave him … damn! He ran off to drink it all himself, didn't he?\n\nI have to get back to town. Take this, and thank you, friend!"
"116521668-0-6581";"You've done more than many would do—more than many would be capable of. I think my friends and I will need to recuperate before setting out to sea again."
"116521668-0-6587";"Thank you, outsider. Because of you, the Hist tree's eternal suffering and enslavement shall finally come to an end.\n\nWe shall mourn the Hist, but we shall also find solace now that its pain and torment is over. When you need us, we shall be there."
"116521668-0-6588";"You made the right choice, outsider. Life must always be preserved and cherished, even a life of pain and suffering and bondage.\n\nWhen the time comes, my warriors will be yours to command. Perhaps if you succeed, the Hist can finally be free."
"116521668-0-6602";"Good work. With this I can convince my superiors of the Imperial threat. The Dominion needs more soldiers like you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an ambush to plan."
"116521668-0-6603";"Give you my gratitude.\n\nThe Daedra drove Nerien'eth to do this. I know it. I would leave this plane, but I cannot, knowing Nerien'eth is still out there. He may return, and on that day, I will do everything I can to free him from Daedric influence."
"116521668-0-6604";"That Sea Drake attack was the last straw. Iriana and I are going back to town and not leaving until we find a ship off this damned island."
"116521668-0-6605";"I'm amazed it worked at all, but thanks to you, I've made remarkable strides today. Neramo will be thrilled!\n\nPlease take this for your good work."
"116521668-0-6627";"And not a moment too soon.\n\nI managed to subdue one of the tomes. It's proven most enlightening."
"116521668-0-6629";"I've already lost everything. The Pact killed my father for dissenting, and my mother died of grief. What you see here is all I have left in this world.\n\nBut I certainly don't need your pity. Leave me."
"116521668-0-6630";"I must get as far away from here as possible before <<1>> captures me again. \n\nPerhaps I'll stow away on a merchant's ship. I doubt anyone else would show me such kindness. Goodbye. And thank you."
"116521668-0-6631";"I'm fortunate you were the one to find her. She may not know it yet, but <<1>>'s lucky to be alive.\n\nI'll gather what little belongings we have and head to Mournhold. I hope we meet again, friend."
"116521668-0-6635";"No details, please!\n\nWith <<1>> and my ruby back, I just may survive this trip. I kept a few coins for expenses. Here, take them with my thanks."
"116521668-0-6637";"I have heard rumors of such a place. We shall go there at once. And have no fear. I will make sure that your friends arrive safely.\n\nPerhaps the city will provide me more clues as to the magic I seek."
"116521668-0-6641";"Yes, I know of the place. My former master spoke of it once. Its presence annoyed him so.\n\nI'll go with the mages. Perhaps I'll even help them if they run into trouble. You never know. Find me when you're ready to do something significant."
"116521668-0-6643";"Excellent! He'll be perfectly safe. Well, assuming he avoids its gaping maw and other pointy bits, that is."
"116521668-0-6644";"Ah, I wondered about that. It seems the device will require more testing before it's perfected.\n\nHowever, you've helped my research immensely. For that, I express thanks."
"116521668-0-6647";"Yes, yes. That's all of them. Now, let's see. If I toss Tanamo into a cabin and set sail today, I should just make Velyn ahead of the news.\n\nGood luck, drylegs."
"116521668-0-6649";"A city? Ah, what an excellent idea. A warm bath, a glass of fine wine. I don't remember the last time I had such luxuries.\n\nThese dear mages and I will keep each other company along the way. We should have no problems reaching the place!"
"116521668-0-6654";"You could've just taken care of your own business in there and left us to our fate. But you didn't. \n\nI owe you. If that strange city over there has a tavern, the first drink's on me. And … thanks."
"116521668-0-6657";"This means three things. First, you were instrumental in crushing the pirate invasion of <<1>>. Second, the Dominion's leadership owes you a debt of thanks.\n\nAnd third, I am privileged to be the one who pays it. An honor to fight beside you."
"116521668-0-6659";"Then I'll distill an antidote immediately. With so many poisoned, we couldn't have repelled the bandits without your help."
"116521668-0-6660";"What has the fool girl done?\n\nNever mind that. <<1>> has almost finished his antidote. Once <<2>> recovers, our warriors will find these bandits and crack open their skulls."
"116521668-0-6661";"I see.\n\nI take no pleasure in my brother's death. I know he blamed me for his loss, but to come after his bloodkin in this way? It was what must be done."
"116521668-0-6684";"You will? We have waited such a long time for someone to aid us in our struggle. You have made me very happy, outsider! \n\nNow we can get our children back! Now we can have our revenge!"
"116521668-0-6685";"I knew you would help me! I'll show you how to get into the tower, but first you need to convince my people to end their service to Molag Bal.\n\nAnd to do that, you have to prove yourself to my clan."
"116521668-0-6686";"They're putting out the lighthouse signal fire so ships will crash on the rocks! \n\nSomeone's got to warn the lighthouse keeper—Tyree. Damn it! If only we could spare the men!\n\nThanks for at least letting me know. Safe travels, friend."
"116521668-0-6690";"They were marched off to the east. My first mate went after them, but I can't imagine she'll be able to free them alone.\n\nIf you travel in that direction, keep an eye out for her. If she doesn't return soon, I may just have to track her down myself."
"116521668-0-6693";"What has the fool girl done?\n\nNever mind that. <<1>> has almost finished his antidote. Once <<2>> recovers, our warriors will find these bandits and crack open their skulls."
"116521668-0-6694";"Truly? This is wonderful!\n\nPlease, accept a meager payment for your trouble. And if a strangler-infested marsh doesn't frighten you, perhaps we should speak of additional work."
"116521668-0-6700";"Oh, excellent! Let me see. Oh my, look at this gibberish. Driven insane by ancient ruins? This is a gold mine! The pseudo-intellectuals of Elden Root love this stuff.\n\nThe commentary volumes alone will keep me employed for years to come."
"116521668-0-6705";"Well, you're full of surprises! You weren't followed here, were you?\n\nNo, no, never mind, I'm sure everything's fine. Thank you for delivering this! Good for the crew's morale."
"116521668-0-6708";"We are the jungle. We were trapped in the city of stone by the Elf-things, unable to drink from the sun. But you have freed us. Even now the Green calls us back to the fold. We will … do what we can to atone.\n\nWe thank you."
"116521668-0-6713";"She wouldn't say that lightly. With quality metal, I could rebuild this tower as a new home and drive my brother's tin profits into the ground.\n\nI'm an Orc of my word. My quarrel ends today."
"116521668-0-6724";"Auri-El bless and keep you, traveler. You have no idea how much this means to an old woman. Now I can find peace myself. \n\nI'll be with my babies soon. It's been so long since I've seen their faces."
"116521668-0-6731";"I'm sorry to hear that. But at least you found the parts.\n\nI'll fix Leggy up good as the day he was forged. From where my heartwater wells up, I thank you."
"116521668-0-6735";"Oh, you did. And, as promised, here's your share of the winnings. Finally things are looking up for Firtoril!"
"116521668-0-6742";"The Heritance has expanded beyond Auridon? Damnit. \n\nI'll make sure the boss hears about your good work. Thanks for your service."
"116521668-0-6772";"Good. Seeing Imperials floating downstream brightens my day. The reward is yours."
"116521668-0-6787";"I suppose I'll write a paper about it. This hunk of crystal will occupy the next five years of my life.\n\nIt's a bit sad when I say it out loud."
"116521668-0-6789";"Oh, no. I hoped we would join together in one last embrace, before triggering our death with my voice. But I whispered his name aloud as I waited … was that enough to collapse the stones?\n\nI should … go now …."
"116521668-0-6795";"I'm amazed the Imperials hadn't stolen it already. I suspect they left it in the hopes of trapping me if I came to get it. You foiled that plan. Well done."
"116521668-0-6796";"Excellent! These should help fund us for a few more days, at least. Here's your share."
"116521668-0-6802";"Ha! I look forward to the sounds of puking coming from across the river. Should make things safer around here for a day or two. Great job!"
"116521668-0-6813";"Good. I hope we can take advantage of the confusion you've caused. But we must act soon, as they will quickly promote a new lieutenant from the ranks."
"116521668-0-6817";"I'll keep you in mind if anyone else gets captured. The soldiers insisted I give you this reward."
"116521668-0-6822";"Of course. He couldn't risk being captured.\n\nYou lived to tell the tale. I hear gold heals all wounds."
"116521668-0-6835";"They'll build more, but you've slowed them down. The Shadowed Path will be a problem as long as this civil war lasts. After that, they're my next target.\n\nYou've earned this reward."
"116521668-0-6837";"I hear Kaleen intends to head toward the isle of Betnikh. The ruins there greatly interest me. But first, I will assist you in this heist."
"116521668-0-6838";"I had it in my hands … and it vanished in that blinding light! Blasted Dwemer magic.\n\nThen those undead came, crawling from the ground. Perhaps the Eye woke them. Sep's tongue, something awful has befallen this place. We need to get clear."
"116521668-0-6839";"It's beautiful! It'll definitely go on my mantle at home, if I ever get my house back from the Imperials."
"116521668-0-6842";"I will tell the troops; morale will improve greatly. Sometimes I feel more like a nursemaid than a troop commander.\n\nThank you."
"116521668-0-6846";"Excellent … ""The Circus of Cheerful Slaughter?"" That's quite a title!\n\nI'll begin my research immediately. Can't wait to get to it."
"116521668-0-6852";"Saving our lives is a little more than just ""help."" Next time you see us, we'll be privateers!\n\n<<1>> and I are going to miss you. We scrounged a bit and came up with something. I hope it serves you well."
"116521668-0-6855";"You said it. I'm not fighting anymore. I'll make weapons for others. Mother will just have to get used to it. Thanks for everything!"
"116521668-0-6857";"I'm going to give this warrior stuff a try! Maybe I'll see you again, if I survive."
"116521668-0-6859";"It's as I said. This is the realm of Baan Dar himself! To many he is the Pariah, an outcast. But we Bosmeri and the Khajiit know him for what he is. The Legend, the Robber Baron, Master of Shadows—he who is called the Bandit God! Baan Dar!"
"116521668-0-6861";"""Driven off?"" You mean she's not dead? I hope you know what you're doing.\n\nWe'll oversee the Goblins from here. Their continued cooperation will ensure that they are spared."
"116521668-0-6877";"I'm sorry. I got back here and I had to tell my parents and my friends about the slaver attack down at the village ….\n\nAnd then it just completely slipped my mind. Not much point in doing it now."
"116521668-0-6888";"I don't know. With the ritual ended, the undead in this facility should slowly fade with time. As for myself, well … I suppose I could approach the Mages Guild, see if my services could be of use.\n\nI'm sure I'll figure something out."
"116521668-0-6890";"No trouble from giants, eh? Well, you have my thanks and that of the good patrons here. They'll eat and drink well tonight because of you."
"116521668-0-6891";"You've earned this coin then. If all sellswords were more like you, they'd find a warmer welcome!"
"116521668-0-6892";"I suppose I always knew he wasn't coming back. But this letter …. He left us to keep us safe. ""I will sing of you in the halls of Sovngarde."" Oh, father ….\n\nThank you. I have peace at last."
"116521668-0-6893";"I disapprove. Many of my people had their souls consumed by that thing. You have condemned others to the same fate.\n\nEven so, you saved my tribe. For that, I will respect your decision. Without you, we would all be dead."
"116521668-0-6895";"The only correct choice. War should be honorable. There is no honor in the use of such a device.\n\nYou have saved my tribe and my island. For this, I owe you a great debt."
"116521668-0-6897";"And I've got your payment! Jilan-dar always keeps some squirreled away in the bottom of the boat. The Goblins overlooked it, thankfully.\n\nPleasure doing business with you, and thanks for saving Khajiit."
"116521668-0-6923";"Isn't it obvious? Open the door! They must be hiding something good down there.\n\nLet's go see!"
"116521668-0-6924";"I have to face the Hound. If I can reason with him, then there'll be no need to go after the Silvenar.\n\nEven after all he's done, I need to give him that chance."
"116521668-0-6940";"Seeing as it's you asking, sure. If she's planning a job, I'm in. All I ask is a trip off this rock after it's over."
"116521668-0-6941";"Yes. Yes, I do. I know someone on the island who can make us both rich.\n\nIf you're up for another job, I think it's time you met her."
"116521668-0-6942";"I hope she listens to reason. She acts like she's in charge, but she wouldn't even listen to my proposal. Trade proposal, mind you. Not a marriage proposal!\n\nThose snake hides would earn them plenty of gold. Plenty of gold for all of us!"
"116521668-0-6944";"The Green Lady is my betrothed. Well met! If you are her friend, you can help me.\n\nYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me."
"116521668-0-6946";"Listen, I thought I contracted corpus from the Skeever cookies she gave me last year! She'll be fine! Thanks again, that was a great trick. I'm sure Baan Dar is well pleased."
"116521668-0-6950";"Excellent work, I knew I could count on you.\n\nWith the reinforcements here, we can see to the Goblins as peacefully as we can. There will be restrictions, of course, but their willingness to stay out of the fighting may well save them."
"116521668-0-6953";"Good news. Good news indeed. I was feeling a bit parched on this beach. Ale's run dry, you see.\n\nI've a slew of hard-working lads I mentored back in Anvil, and many the contact who might … help <<1>>. My thanks for your service."
"116521668-0-6956";"That ring belonged to Raerana's mother! It's got her name inscribed on it. Damned bandits willing to murder for gold. Bastards. Poor Raerana!\n\nWell, I appreciate you getting to the bottom of this."
"116521668-0-6959";"Though Dro-Dara is sad to see Murk-Watcher leave us, he is happy to know this evil man is dead.\n\nPerhaps someday this plantation may flourish again. Not by Dro-Dara's hand though. Knarstygg and I are leaving. Goodbye, and thank you."
"116521668-0-6961";"No. Well, I've spoken to them, but gotten no answers.\n\nThis may take a little more effort than I first estimated."
"116521668-0-6965";"Of course. You have earned it. \n\nI would be surprised if we crossed paths again, but you never know. Anything is possible."
"116521668-0-6966";"Was it difficult? No matter. You did well. You've avenged Golun and all the others Aera lied to and murdered. Nimalten is safe.\n\nWe owe you a great debt. The Worms will find no shelter in the shadow of Nimalten!"
"116521668-0-6969";"No. Well, I've spoken to them, but gotten no answers.\n\nThis may take a little more effort than I first estimated."
"116521668-0-6971";"Sharp claws, traveler. It's been an honor to fight by your side. And I think I know why Rid-Thar appeared to you. Good thing those monks were so insistent on our lessons. I'm pretty sure you're the Moon Hallowed! Amazing."
"116521668-0-6972";"Ha! Shazah managed to get her head out of a book long enough to break through, eh? Well done, well done. Khali has some White-Eye brandy in her pack. You've more than earned some!"
"116521668-0-6974";"Raston will remain our guest while we finalize details with the female trader. We have ways to make sure he never speaks of us again. But have no fear. He will be released shortly.\n\nPity. He would have served the Ghost Snake well."
"116521668-0-6976";"I realized that, if the Worm Cult managed to raise Nanwen, my secret would be known.\n\nWhich is why I sent you to stop them. For what good that did me. I hope I can trust you to keep your mouth shut."
"116521668-0-6977";"Let's see what you have here.\n\nAh, very good. I'm glad these survived. You and Dulini have done Tamriel a great service by returning these to us."
"116521668-0-6987";"Sneak up on you? It's what I do. Howler draws all the attention, I do all the sneaking."
"116521668-0-6988";"Well, that's perfect! Get me out of here and I'm at your service. You'll find me a man of many talents!"
"116521668-0-6989";"I regret I must complete my work here before entertaining additional opportunities. I must find a way inside Bthzark!"
"116521668-0-6990";"Our ship's sunk and Captain Lerisa's missing. I didn't sign on for this!"
"116521668-0-6992";"I regret I must complete my work here before considering additional opportunities. I must find a way inside Bthzark!"
"116521668-0-6993";"If the Maiden's Breath wasn't rotting on the beach, I'd happily oblige, considering all you've done for us. But no ship, no ride.\n\nI do know someone who might give us a job, though. A job that just might get us both off this rock."
"116521668-0-6994";"She's a bit too obsessed with old Fahara'jad for me, but I like her style. Seeing as I need a new ship, gold will come in handy.\n\nI'm in. Can't let what you did for us go unrewarded. See you back in town."
"116521668-0-6995";"If the Maiden's Breath wasn't rotting on the beach, I'd happily oblige, considering all you've done for us. But no ship, no ride.\n\nI do know someone who might give us a job, though. A job that just might get us both off this rock."
"116521668-0-6996";"First, I will find my daughter. Hold her one last time, and try to remember the lessons she taught me. Then … I must rebuild.\n\nPerhaps I will find the concept of balance once again. If that is to be my burden, I carry it gladly."
"116521668-0-6997";"One must discard what makes the scales tip. This is the truth of Z'en. <<1>> no longer wished for balance. Thus, he was no longer a follower of Z'en.\n\nFarewell, mortal. Z'en has turned his back from this world. Until the scales tip once again."
"116521668-0-6999";"Let's see what you have here.\n\nAh, very good. I'm glad these survived. You and Dulini have done Tamriel a great service by returning these to us."
"116521668-0-7005";"Seeing as it's you asking, sure. If she's planning a job, I'm in. All I ask is a trip off this rock after it's over."
"116521668-0-7006";"Yes. Yes, I do. I know someone on the island who can make us both rich.\n\nIf you're up for another job, I think it's time you met her."
"116521668-0-7014";"The Ayleid relic is the key, but my memories have faded with time. I no longer remember its location. I know only that you must find it before the Bloodthorn.\n\nI offer this knowledge as payment for the souls you saved today."
"116521668-0-7015";"The Green Lady is my betrothed. Well met! If you are her friend, you can help me.\n\nYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me."
"116521668-0-7016";"So Almalexia believes. \n\nI was told to convey upon you the gratitude of the Tribunal. And to inform you that the Sacred Lady still has need of your services."
"116521668-0-7019";"Remarkable! Really, just amazing! You're the new Champion of the Blessed Crucible, inheritor of the Brimstone Crown! \n\nLet all in attendance know that the Champion walks here. Let no one bar your path!"
"116521668-0-7023";"I would say thank you, but I think you've done enough."
"116521668-0-7024";"This is all we can spare, please, take it and we'll be on our way. Thanks to you, I think we'll be all right."
"116521668-0-7027";"<You open the treasure chest, revealing the riches inside.>"
"116521668-0-7031";"Thank Kynareth! I thought I'd get eaten by a Goblin for sure.\n\nThey de-bone you, then carve your thigh-bones into flutes. It's true, I swear!"
"116521668-0-7032";"I don't rejoice at this news. Rama was a fine officer once. \n\nAt least it is over. Thank you."
"116521668-0-7033";"I don't rejoice at this news. Rama was a fine officer once. \n\nAt least it is over. Thank you."
"116521668-0-7046";"Perhaps it was simply arrogance. Perhaps it was all part of his grand scheme. Who can know the logic of a Daedric Prince? \n\nI will call upon you again when the time is right. Farewell, Vestige."
"116521668-0-7049";"Nothing ventured, nothing gained! And it worked, did it not?\n\nDo me one last favor, will you? Don't mention my experiments to the locals. The last one I ran into wasn't as open minded as yourself. Although, he did make a good volunteer …."
"116521668-0-7051";"I'm always happy to share our stories. It's the least I could do to thank you for saving me from those werewolves.\n\nWe're proud of our history in Deepwoods."
"116521668-0-7052";"Head into town and get a drink! This is home and we'll be here for a while.\n\nHere's your cut of the take from the heist."
"116521668-0-7056";"The city is closed against me! The ancient wards and guardians all see me as hostile.\n\nI could force my way inside, but that might hurt the people of Silvenar. This is supposed to be a celebration, not a war. I'll need your help once again."
"116521668-0-7057";"The dangers that face us become clearer. I will try to convince Chief Tazgol of this, though I doubt he will accept the word of an outsider. Your efforts on our behalf bring you honor."
"116521668-0-7060";"I won't let her live like this, Hallowed. I won't. You and I are going to walk the Path together. We'll destroy Tharn and I will return with the most powerful sages in Tamriel. Together we'll free my sister from this torment."
"116521668-0-7061";"You've bought us some time and taken out a significant portion of the Colovian forces. Now it's our turn to strike back."
"116521668-0-7063";"She did, eh? I don't know what she told you to get you out here. But I guess I can't turn down help."
"116521668-0-7064";"Good. You should know, little one, that you've helped one of the most respected members of our small community.\n\nAnd you have his gratitude. Hmph."
"116521668-0-7065";"Good! Now get gone. Ezzag has many chores to do, and has already spent too much time jawing with you."
"116521668-0-7066";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … as they have not done for my family."
"116521668-0-7067";"Here you are. I know Shuzura is hard to deal with, so Tazia will say what she cannot. S'ren-ja's path is lit by bright moons. All because of you, traveler.\n\nFrom this day forward, you are always welcome in our little town."
"116521668-0-7068";"It may be hard for an outsider to understand. But we Rangers take our heritage very seriously. \n\nHonoring the memory of the Founder … it's everything. I'm sure Nendaer would agree—you'd make a good Ranger."
"116521668-0-7069";"Thank you, traveler. The Falinesti will remember your stewardship.\n\nAs a reward, I offer you the chance to see a ritual few outsiders have ever seen."
"116521668-0-7071";"Oh, indeed. I'm sure in time the Arbordawn will return to themselves. It's just … it's a shame we didn't discover where the Falinesti have gone. It may have to remain one of Tamriel's great mysteries.\n\nThank you, assistant!"
"116521668-0-7073";"The schematics are mine at last! Splendid.\n\nThis places me in your debt. I have an idea how I can repay you."
"116521668-0-7078";"You've bought us some time and taken out a significant portion of the Colovian forces. Now it's our turn to strike back."
"116521668-0-7089";"Ha! A partner after my own heart. Here's your cut. My client will be purring in delight!"
"116521668-0-7091";"Oh good! This is a very rare Daedric beard pot. Massive Dremora would wear these suspended by chains around their necks to protect their lustrous beards.\n\nIsn't it fascinating? Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-7092";"For your respect of Khajiiti history, your love of the past, receive this blessing. May the Bright Moons guard your steps until the end of your days."
"116521668-0-7095";"Oh no! He was such a good son, always thinking of his mother. Why did he have to go and do such a stupid thing?\n\nThanks for bringing these to me. I'll make an omlette in his memory. It will be salted with my tears and peppered by my grief."
"116521668-0-7097";"Oh, dear. I knew this day would come. What's the procedure for this? Oh, yes.\n\nHouse Redoran thanks you for your service. Go with our gratitude."
"116521668-0-7100";"<<1>>! Those last words I said to her … I take it all back! Forgive me, love!\n\nPlease, go. I can't bear to speak of her anymore."
"116521668-0-7101";"blah"
"116521668-0-7102";"Best Boast we've had in years. Believe you me, Baan Dar is well pleased. Very well pleased indeed! Feel free to return to the Dance any time you want. And keep an eye out. You might see me around!"
"116521668-0-7106";"Ra Gada or not, I owe you a debt for returning my shield. Don't think I'd be able to show my face in Windhelm without it!\n\nI've been in this tiny village long enough. It's about time I get back out there and knock in a few heads!"
"116521668-0-7112";"Unbelievable! Razum-dar, dead. I hope … Burri hopes that wherever he is, the moons shine bright upon him. If he trusted you with this task, he must have greatly respected you. Go well, soldier."
"116521668-0-7118";"Thank Zenithar! We'll keep an eye on those Bloody Hand Goblins from now on. \n\nI hope we can buy them off with a few bushels of food next time. That usually works."
"116521668-0-7119";"By Kyne, you did it! I've been expecting them to attack the town any minute. Bhosek tossed me out when I tried to warn him, said he'd have my head if I didn't shut up. He'll never know you saved his town for him."
"116521668-0-7120";"Problem? Make that problems. Chickens eaten by predators, horses down with disease, and the damned fields!\n\nWhich problem are you here to solve, moons-blessed savior of Ezzag's humble farm?"
"116521668-0-7121";"Oh good, another helper for Kalari. Thank you for coming over, but I am not sure you can help."
"116521668-0-7122";"That was not your call! Razum-dar told you what had to be done. Now, he must carry this circlet. Search for a new place to hide it. A fearsome burden, and one he does not take lightly. Damn it!"
"116521668-0-7123";"You're a godsend! Things are still a little hazy, but I think that's the ale.\n\nTake this gold for your efforts."
"116521668-0-7124";"I feel Zenithar's blessing on us already. May his blessing be on you as well, friend!"
"116521668-0-7127";"It's all we have to hold on to right now. I … have my doubts, but I need to stay strong for <<1>>.\n\nBut even so, this was all worth it. Just to know there're still good people in this world. People like you."
"116521668-0-7132";"You're in. I've got some preparations to make, and then we're as good as gone."
"116521668-0-7134";"Thank you. We'll sell this food at markets in Alessia and Drakelowe. Here's the pay Shagol would have received, if he wasn't so lazy.\n\nHow did you like the village? Nice, huh? Think of us when it comes time to settle down."
"116521668-0-7137";"Of course not. Silly of me to think you'd lift a finger to do anything at all!\n\nWell, you've done your good deed for the day. I need to attend to my brother. Excuse me."
"116521668-0-7141";"Good! Now get gone. Ezzag has many chores to do, and has already spent too much time jawing with you."
"116521668-0-7142";"I knew that Goblin-spawn would put a dagger in our backs. Siraj never could pass up a pretty face.\n\nThis bracelet was given to my ancestors by King Fahel. Siraj always wore it. Take this in thanks. Ruptga guide you."
"116521668-0-7145";"By Kyne, that's the Goblin king's crown! Bastards killed my brothers and were going to attack the town. With that king dead, they're probably killing and eating each other by now."
"116521668-0-7148";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … as they have not done for my family."
"116521668-0-7149";"That'll keep us safe for another day, I hope. Luckily, there's no shortage of adventurers willing to help us out. Here's the coin I promised.\n\nIs that a bit of skull on your boot?"
"116521668-0-7154";"Ha! I knew you'd get it done. Who needs the old crew—those traitors!—when we've got you helping us?"
"116521668-0-7161";"I suspected Baron Sorick from the start. Don't worry—he'll pay for his crimes. I'll take it from here."
"116521668-0-7162";"My scout? <<1>>! Then <<2>> may still be alive! She'd be camped at our fallback position.\n\nI must go to them. Thank you for all you've done! I'd be dead if you hadn't come!"
"116521668-0-7166";"You found it! I thought my <<z:1>> was lost forever. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-7168";"Not much chance of that. It goes out anytime there's even a stray breeze. But as long as someone's willing to re-light it, we're happy. As I said, we're a superstitious lot."
"116521668-0-7169";"Rough luck. Thanks so much for bringing news. It's better than spending the rest of my life wondering."
"116521668-0-7171";"Excellent. I doubt we'll ever eliminate that tribe, but with luck we can keep them from an all-out attack.\n\nTake this with our gratitude."
"116521668-0-7181";"That's one less valuable for the bandits to profit from. I'll keep sending adventurers out there until there's nothing left to steal back.\n\nThank you for your efforts."
"116521668-0-7184";"Bloodthorn Cultists were sighted at those ruins. Chieftain Tazgol has already taken the army to deal with them. They're walking into a trap!"
"116521668-0-7186";"He's what? No! Let me see that! I told him not to join those fools! Why didn't he listen?\n\nHe figured out the truth for himself, in the end. I can be proud of my boy. That's not enough, but it'll have to do."
"116521668-0-7189";"Cultists have indeed been spotted at Carzog's Demise. Their intent is unknown.\n\nI will pray for the honored dead then return to speak with the chief. I fear all will be needed to end the Bloodthorn plot."
"116521668-0-7194";"I guess I'll just console myself with her gold and the taste of victory.\n\nAhem. ""Beddi, I recognize that you've lost. I release you from our contract."""
"116521668-0-7195";"Oh, look. There he is now. Poor, bedraggled darling. \n\nThank you for helping him. I really will feel better once I get him safely to my mother's house. I just adore him so. I'd hate for anything to happen to him."
"116521668-0-7197";"Red Rooks under Ilessan Tower? These bandits continue poking their noses where they don't belong.\n\nThanks for letting us know. It provides context to this attack and now we can watch for any reinforcements from the tower."
"116521668-0-7198";"That's a relief, though I wished I'd killed it myself. I really wanted to stab it over and over again.\n\nMaybe I'll go jab the body a few times, just to be sure."
"116521668-0-7199";"Thank you. It seems silly to worry about books at such times, but I would hate to see Goblins destroy our heritage. If those books were lost and Goblins overran us, no one would know we were ever here!"
"116521668-0-7200";"I didn't think we'd ever find this journal! My brother escaped the mines, but one of Faolchu's werewolves attacked him. He's resting, but he'll be happy to have this again. And I'm sure his notes will be useful.\n\nThank you for returning it to us!"
"116521668-0-7202";"Little Ozo! You found him! Thank you so much! \n\nI don't know how he manages to get so lost. Here's the reward, as promised!"
"116521668-0-7203";"This is interesting. We suspected the Red Rooks of collaborating with the Bloodthorns, but it's heartening to know that their alliance is fragile.\n\nWe can use this to our advantage. And I can also make good use of these healing recipes."
"116521668-0-7209";"Fine, fine! You have a deal. I hope you choke on it.\n\nNow tell that damn Gelvin to come out so we can finish our preparations."
"116521668-0-7211";"Indeed. Tamriel is fortunate that my people decided to handle the crisis. And we are fortunate to have you.\n\nIf we had allowed it, the Maormer would have devastated the Malabal Tor mainland with their storms."
"116521668-0-7212";"Truly? Rid-Thar-ri'Datta himself? This one is humbled by his faith in Azahrr. She will do her best to make him proud. \n\nThe Order of the Claw will protect their most sacred relic, and the March will one day be cleansed of these shadows."
"116521668-0-7213";"<You light the candle to memorialize Ehtayah's brother, Indal.>"
"116521668-0-7215";"Well, that's a start. Goblins are like ants—you think they're all dead, then more show up. Another Goblin will declare itself chieftain soon. I hope someone is here to help when it happens."
"116521668-0-7216";"The thought sickens me, but they might be needed. Cultists have been sighted at Carzog's Demise. I will deliver the horn to Chief Tazgol and he can decide to use it or not."
"116521668-0-7217";"Good. You should know, little one, that you've helped one of the most respected members of our small community.\n\nAnd you have his gratitude. Hmph."
"116521668-0-7218";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … and Mathal's, wherever he may be."
"116521668-0-7219";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … as they have not done for my family."
"116521668-0-7220";"Good. You should know, little one, that you've helped one of the most respected members of our small community.\n\nAnd you have his gratitude. Hmph."
"116521668-0-7225";"Good! Now get gone. Ezzag has many chores to do, and has already spent too much time jawing with you."
"116521668-0-7231";"No more will be forced to this horrible place. You have helped do a great thing.\n\nNow Tamriel is safe. Safer. Safe-ish? Until others make bad deals with Dremora. Sometimes Mezha-dro weeps for the world."
"116521668-0-7235";"We were attacked. Savaged by a dark creature … and I think it was a Khajiit. The Mane!"
"116521668-0-7237";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … and Mathal's, wherever he may be."
"116521668-0-7238";"Thank you, for all that you have done. May bright moons light your path … and Mathal's, wherever he may be."
"116521668-0-7252";"Then it's as the Mane suggested. Magical forces are at work here that we can't fight with sheer numbers. I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nI'm just glad we have you and Indaenir on our side to sort this out. Yes. I think maybe Y'ffre smiles on us after all."
"116521668-0-7253";"I thought the Daggers were finished. But, well, it looks like we have a future after all!\n\nHere, take this. For helping us finish the job. Consider it a small token of our appreciation. And you'll always have a place with the Daggers if you want it."
"116521668-0-7255";"Oh, you did. And, as promised, here's your share of the winnings. Finally things are looking up for Firtoril!"
"116521668-0-7256";"Oh, you did. And, as promised, here's your share of the winnings. Finally things are looking up for Firtoril!"
"116521668-0-7257";"My word is as solid as this steel. Take my axe. Maybe someday you'll learn how to use it."
"116521668-0-7268";"You saw possible futures. No path is set. Your actions will influence what is to come."
"116521668-0-7274";"Hmm. That's troubling news. I'll pass that to my commander as soon as we're done here.\n\nThank you for your service, traveler."
"116521668-0-7277";"It has, friend. It has!\n\nYou've given me and the others a chance to bring our story to Tamriel, and perhaps bring closure for our loved ones. You have my eternal gratitude. I only hope the Divines find a way to pay you back for your kindness."
"116521668-0-7280";"And I'm damned proud to be standing with you. Ahem. All right, enough of emotion. Let's walk the Moons-damned Path and see this through. The way Shazah would have wanted."
"116521668-0-7281";"I'll get it as far away from Marius as possible. You've saved numerous lives today."
"116521668-0-7282";"I know it's a lot to take in. We'll talk more later.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll keep an eye on the Prophet. Hopefully that orb will help him find out where Sai Sahan is being held. Once we know that, we can plan our next move."
"116521668-0-7283";"This is the last of it, then. Anyone who tries to stand in my way will regret it.\n\nHere's your coin, as promised. Now begone, there's much work to be done."
"116521668-0-7285";"Is there? You don't just recover from vampirism. \n\nGods, what am I talking about? He's my son! I have to try. \n\nI'm not ready to lose him."
"116521668-0-7286";"You have my never-ending thanks! If I should meet a singer in my travels, I'll commission a song in your honor.\n\nLuck to your house, my friend."
"116521668-0-7287";"Help? You saved me from a fate worse than death! What that Argonian had planned … well, you'll see! The claw's on the other foot, now.\n\nPlease, take this reward. It's not much, but you've earned it tenfold."
"116521668-0-7288";"My gratitudinous knows no bounds. I'm not certain my reputation would survive the humiliation of paying off this bet.\n\nHere, take this. It may not help a hunter of your obvious adroitinosity, but you deserve something for your efforts."
"116521668-0-7289";"You're right. It has to be done. It has to."
"116521668-0-7290";"Dead? Then the guides told the truth. Thank you for my strength and my life!\n\nI'll visit Mauloch's fury upon our clan! They'll pay the blood price for abandoning my father and me."
"116521668-0-7291";"Dead? I don't … the males of my clan were right. I'm weak, not worth saving. Still, the poison no longer burns in my veins.\n\nThank you for your efforts. I'll stay here and rest. Perhaps some day I'll be strong enough to leave."
"116521668-0-7306";"That is some consolation at least. Mallius will be sorely missed. Thank you, friend, for bringing the urn and news of Mallius's end.\n\nIn the future, if you know you will face Daedra, return to me. I may be able to help."
"116521668-0-7307";"His last blessing, given to another. I am not surprised—Mallius was ever selfless. I will travel to <<1>> and recover his body. He deserves rest.\n\nThank you, friend, for all you have done. Arkay be with you!"
"116521668-0-7310";"What you've done has helped the entire town. You've given us back our pride.\n\nWe should never have let those Red Rooks frighten us. We're tougher than that. You can bet we'll be better prepared in the future."
"116521668-0-7315";"Aren't we all, my friend. Aren't we all.\n\nWe might be able to assist each other, but we have some other business to take care of first."
"116521668-0-7320";"Yes. I'll say my farewells first. It won't be easy, but I won't sneak out like a thief. My family has a right to hear it from my lips. \n\nI'll see you on the ship when you're ready to leave."
"116521668-0-7321";"Travel to <<1>> to have it appraised. Surely Zahra has dealt with <<2>> in the past. She is wily, but Zahra is her match.\n\nHere is compensation for your efforts. Rest assured, you will be remembered when Zahra tells the tale!"
"116521668-0-7326";"I thank you. Water and bandages will keep our wounded from passing over Shor's Bridge.\n\nTake this for your efforts."
"116521668-0-7338";"Kyne be praised! We'll get these prepared immediately. \n\nYour efforts will save lives here. I can't thank you enough."
"116521668-0-7341";"You've done more than most. Thank Kyne you showed up to help us!"
"116521668-0-7343";"Good news. Good news indeed. I was feeling a bit parched on this beach. Ale's run dry, you see.\n\nI know several hard-working lads back in Anvil. I'll see they throw a proper … hero's welcome for <<1>>. My thanks for your service."
"116521668-0-7344";"What? That can't be. Being a bandit was supposed to be full of excitement and adventure. If you have this then he must have really said that. I need some time alone to think."
"116521668-0-7345";"The Seamount Warchief? Impressive. I don't know what you did to convince him, friend, but you have my gratitude. Well done!\n\nI will take this petition to High King Emeric immediately. Enjoy your stay in Daggerfall."
"116521668-0-7347";"Thank you. I'm still not ready to marry, but I accept my duty to my clan. I'll ask my father's wives for guidance, to prepare for my duties."
"116521668-0-7349";"Thank you. I can't leave to do this myself, and few others would survive the trip. Your efforts will keep at least some here from passing over Shor's Bridge."
"116521668-0-7351";"That gives us some breathing room. I'm sure they'll try again, but we'll burn that bridge when we come to it.\n\nAluri will keep an eye on the roads. That's all we can do for now."
"116521668-0-7368";"We'll stay here for a while, at least until the trolls are gone.\n\nMany thanks for your help. If you ever have the need for a Dreamwalker, you only need to ask. It would be my honor to help one who helped us."
"116521668-0-7369";"I may not be the most honest Nord, but I promised I would surrender myself to the royal workers if you got me away from the rieklings. And I will.\n\nI never intended for anyone to get hurt. I'll stay away from enchanted items from now on."
"116521668-0-7370";"A sorry tale. The lying bard got many of my friends killed.\n\nI'll tell the others what happened. A rough end, but fitting for one such as him."
"116521668-0-7380";"So now you know. Our foes are deadly and numerous. It is wisdom, not cowardice, that keeps us inside the shelters left to us."
"116521668-0-7381";"By the Green, well done. I was beginning to wonder if anyone was going to show up. Claim these pretty little coins … ah, and these will do fine. I get a pretty necklace and there are fewer dangerous beasts wandering the wilds. Here you go!"
"116521668-0-7382";"Ha! And you're worried I won't hold up my end of the bargain? \n\nNo no. I keep my promises. You got rid of those parasitic Orcs—you've earned the right to petition the Wilderking for an audience."
"116521668-0-7383";"Damn. This proves that Pelidil is planning something here, something even bigger than killing the queen.\n\nI'm glad you brought it to light. I just hope it's not too late for us to do something about it."
"116521668-0-7384";"You have not yet earned that knowledge, which Naemon and Pelidil took by force.\n\nThey went to Hectahame. Where you go is your choice, but I will be watching."
"116521668-0-7387";"I'll let them know. We must get help, so we can only send out the runners and hope some survive.\n\nThe way our luck is going, the Dremora will get them all before they leave town."
"116521668-0-7395";"I truly cannot thank you enough. This one wishes she could stay and chat, but she must deliver the coffer as soon as possible. Safe travels!"
"116521668-0-7398";"Moons be damned, I will get my sister back. I don't care what that moldering old ghost says. I'll walk the Path with you, cut Tharn's throat, and come back with an army of mages to free Shazah from this torment."
"116521668-0-7400";"That's a small blessing. If I had known what Skorvild was doing, maybe I could have talked to him and stopped this.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help. You kept a bad situation from turning even worse."
"116521668-0-7401";"They'll find one, I have no doubt. But it's good to strike back at them as hard as we can. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-7402";"Damn. Honestly, I rather hoped he misheard. I suppose that's rarely the case.\n\nVery well, then. I will muster the city's defenses, but there is only so much we can do. I'm certainly glad you're here. You and Razum-dar may be our best hope."
"116521668-0-7407";"That's the first good news I've heard in a long time. The Dremora and those cursed cultists will have to find another way in now.\n\nI'll trade you a reward for my crystal."
"116521668-0-7410";"You have not yet earned that knowledge, which Naemon and Pelidil took by force.\n\nThey went to Hectahame. Where you go is your choice, but I will be watching."
"116521668-0-7419";"Yes. This does look like Uggissar's writing. I had hoped that his wife would convince him to give up treasure hunting, but it appears that the opposite is true.\n\nThank you for bringing this to me."
"116521668-0-7420";"These … these are my mother's remains. I thought this urn had been lost forever!\n\nI carved the designs onto the urn myself, pictures of things my mother loved. I can't believe thieves would steal it. Thank you for returning it to me."
"116521668-0-7421";"I did, thanks to you. Not only did I make it in time to see my sister get married, but I also decided to follow her example and become a soldier for the Skald-King.\n\nWe're going to drive the traitorous Stormfist out of our land!"
"116521668-0-7422";"As one story ends, another reaches its climax. Our little bit of mischief was a success: because of you, Aranias may very well betray her masters to defend the Wilderking."
"116521668-0-7424";"Fildgor's dead? As it should be. I mourn with my father, though. \n\nYou've been by his side and have persevered when others would have faltered. From now on, you shall be known as the High King's Arrow, for you lead the way and always strike true."
"116521668-0-7431";"You're right. They'll know what to do. They have to.\n\nDespite his rough manner, <<1>> was a hero to many in Stormhold. When this is all over, he'll have a fitting burial."
"116521668-0-7433";"Really? That's outrageous. But that does explain what that old Nord I bought the place from was trying to tell me.\n\nAnyway, we'll leave the camp vacant for now. Eventually the trolls will leave. Take this for helping us. And thank you."
"116521668-0-7434";"Thank you. I will destroy the skull and rid the world of Blackheart's menace once and for all. \n\nMay fortune find you wherever you go, my friend."
"116521668-0-7440";"A Dominion general, perhaps? Whoever he is, we'll stop his march through Shadowfen.\n\nI'll appoint <<1>> to lead the scouts in our search for <<2>>. I swear to you, he'll account for the Dominion's terror."
"116521668-0-7446";"I knew it. They're both too stubborn and proud to take orders from anyone. Well, at least they're alive, for now.\n\nThank you for letting me know."
"116521668-0-7451";"I am too. It has been many years since the plague of necromancy visited our shores.\n\nThough I am relieved the docks are clear, the events of this day are extremely disturbing."
"116521668-0-7469";"So she believes, but there may be a greater truth to her purpose here. \n\nYou may not like this, but I sense the same is true of you."
"116521668-0-7472";"This day will go down in our clan's history, and you helped make it happen! \n\nUnfortunately, I haven't figured out how to keep the guardians under control for very long, but I'm working on it!"
"116521668-0-7473";"<Cirion's body is unnaturally cold. It appears his gamble was successful. High Kinlord Rilis is defeated at last, leaving both dead.>"
"116521668-0-7485";"We'll keep the Fangs safe, as well as your friend here. He will be honored by the Shadowscales for what he did.\n\nFor you, I have a gift. This is one of the weapons I spoke of, made in the Fangs' image. Wield it well."
"116521668-0-7496";"You don't wish to become captain of the royal army? We apologize, but the only other position is royal consort. Though we seek to cause no offense, you simply don't intrigue us in that fashion."
"116521668-0-7497";"<<1>>'s a monster. Over the years the coin, the skooma, they've made him cruel. Cross him and usually you end up buried in a hole out in the wastes. Kill him, and no one will mourn him."
"116521668-0-7500";"There are still matters that must be considered."
"116521668-0-7513";"I thought I'd lost it forever to the mire. When you have so little, everything you have carries meaning.\n\nI erect the spine of gratitude for helping me."
"116521668-0-7515";"We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.\n\nI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again."
"116521668-0-7516";"We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.\n\nI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again."
"116521668-0-7524";"I must take stock of our assets and resources. Determine just how much might we can bring to bear. Only then can I develop a strategy that shall allow us to win this war.\n\nBut forgive me. I wanted to convey that you performed admirably at the tower."
"116521668-0-7528";"The Dominion ambushed us. I'd be ashamed to call it a rout, if I wasn't considering how in Oblivion they knew.\n\nAt least we've learned where they are, even if it's butcher's work to get them out of that place."
"116521668-0-7530";"I take no pleasure in being right. The Dominion must have learned <<1>>'s knowledge of <<A:2>>.\n\nIt is imperative we learn <<A:3>>'s true role in the Dominion's plans. They bring nothing to this land but abomination."
"116521668-0-7534";"You must gather those who were lost. King Dynar and Vanus Galerion have vital roles to play, and they must be at your side.\n\nRescue your missing companions. Return the Hollow City to its former glory and we can begin the assault on Molag Bal."
"116521668-0-7536";"Thank Vivec, some good news! We'll bring the eggs to <<1>> where they'll be safe.\n\nYou handled yourself admirably against such odds. The Dominion would've killed half a generation of Argonians without your help!"
"116521668-0-7538";"I'll need to confer with Abnur regarding what he knows. His defection is a surprise, but it will serve only to benefit us. Mannimarco did not dispose of this asset quickly enough and now it is ours to utilize."
"116521668-0-7543";"Thankfully, your efforts within the Shadow Wood saved many of them. But there is still much corruption in the forest; I can feel it. Our work is far from finished.\n\nHere. I'll take the Heart now."
"116521668-0-7550";"This mission needs a leader. I want you to lead the assault across the Chasm.\n\nWe have asked so much of you and you have already accomplished the impossible, but you are one of a very small few that I would trust with this task."
"116521668-0-7557";"Vampires, here? Sickening. Hunted in our own hunting grounds.\n\nWe'll be more vigilant of their kind now. I'll see to it personally that every last one of them is destroyed.\n\nThank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-7566";"I will. I can't wait to see him again.\n\nPlease, take this. It isn't much, for I could never repay what you've done for me, but I hope it will suffice."
"116521668-0-7571";"Wait. If only one of us makes it out, know that your efforts are incomparable. May Sithis guide your steps through darkness, and spare his touch until you wish it."
"116521668-0-7572";"My soldiers recovered us from the ruins and kept you safe while you slept. Now I've been asked to bring <<A:1>> to the Pact, but it seems an empty shell at best.\n\nHence the ship. Soon it departs Shadowfen for Skyrim."
"116521668-0-7574";"After my soldiers retrieved us from the ruins, I was asked to bring <<A:1>> to the Pact. Hence, the ship. It soon departs Shadowfen for Skyrim.\n\nXuth, does your head hurt? Mine feels like an overused drum!"
"116521668-0-7584";"Wait. Should only one of us walk from these ruins, you must allow me to thank you on behalf of Shadowfen's citizens. Sithis guide your steps in the darkness, and refrain his embrace until you will it."
"116521668-0-7593";"A weapon once gifted to the wasp-children! Bound in blood, it slips through the Hist's dreams. Tree-blood burns, and Tree dies a lonely death, removed from its sisters.\n\nThe guar thanks the mighty wamasu for its mercy."
"116521668-0-7607";"Then we'll finish repairs and shove off at high tide. Oh, your marine friends fended off Sea Vipers while you rescued my crew. They're welcome aboard as long as they want.\n\nPerhaps we'll see you at <<1>>. You'll always have a place on the Prowler."
"116521668-0-7608";"Excellent! Once the tide rises we'll get the Prowler out of here. Your marine friends are welcome to recuperate, as long as they need. \n\nWe'll head to <<1>> soon. You're always welcome aboard the Prowler."
"116521668-0-7625";"I signed a new treaty with <<1>> moments ago. He assured me the Dominion will defend our little island from any reprisals, Maormer or otherwise.\n\n<<2>> will see much change to come. We must grow together, or we shall die apart."
"116521668-0-7626";"Yes, the Great Shackle. Where the Planemeld begins and ends. I thought I could deal with it on my own, but I was wrong.\n\nYou have restored me, released me from captivity. With your continued help, we can end this threat once and for all."
"116521668-0-7627";"I've rarely encountered a creature of <<1>>'s power. There may be a way to separate him from <<2>>, but it will take much time and study.\n\nShe's not just an apprentice, she's my friend. If there's a way to free her, I swear I'll find it."
"116521668-0-7632";"No good comes from dwelling on the past. <<1>> lives, which means there's hope.\n\nHe's a great man, a good man. I don't care how long it takes. I'll find a way to free him from that monster."
"116521668-0-7633";"During our time together, Zur and I determined that the Dwemer device has similarities to the method Molag Bal uses to perform the Planemeld. I will honor Zur's memory and give him credit for this discovery.\n\nThank you again, friend, for saving us."
"116521668-0-7634";"During our time together, we determined that the Dwarven device operates on the same principles as Molag Bal's Planemeld. Zur will honor the Dark Elf's memory and give him credit for this discovery.\n\nThank you again for saving us, my friend."
"116521668-0-7639";"You see what horrors the gods have visited upon Bruma and all who dwell here? I have nothing for Leono. He should pray to be spared our fate.\n\nYou have kept faith with Leono. What the gods have left me, I share with you."
"116521668-0-7641";"You know, the spell web. A pretty elegant trap, really. I think the spell's catalyst has something to do with an interest in knowledge. I'd be insulted, but what can I say. I'm in this for adventure, not scholarly pursuits.\n\nAnd thanks, by the way."
"116521668-0-7656";"By the Eight! That crystal! It is a Light of Meridia! It is said that these orbs of power once allowed Meridia to transport an entire city into Coldharbour.\n\nIf an agent of Meridia harnesses this power for us, we shall gain a distinct advantage."
"116521668-0-7663";"I signed a new treaty moments ago. <<1>> assured me the Dominion will protect our little island.\n\nIt's a new beginning for <<2>>. We will prosper or fall—together."
"116521668-0-7665";"My … husband? Armin? Gods, I believed him dead long ago!\n\nHe-he finally found his ancestor's remains? I-I cannot believe it. This is good news …? Yes, it is just … I need time to digest this. Thank you, though. Thank you so much."
"116521668-0-7667";"If only Silent-Wind had listened to me. He could have had a good life here. Thank you for bringing this to me, friend."
"116521668-0-7668";"I knew someone would find me, eventually. But you don't seem like a bounty hunter.\n\nThe one who wrote this tried to force me to marry his son. I ran instead. Take this coin and forget you ever saw me."
"116521668-0-7670";"My fertilizer! Sylvain's late as usual. But maybe it'll still help my pumpkins. Though that'll just mean more fried pumpkin to eat, I suppose.\n\nHere's a little coin for your trouble."
"116521668-0-7672";"Take it, just don't hurt me."
"116521668-0-7673";"My doll! I thought it was lost forever. I hired a man to cart some things from my old home in Hackdirt. I heard his caravan had been attacked and all my goods stolen.\n\nI can't ever thank you enough!"
"116521668-0-7677";"She's a bright light. She might be able to shine even in Coldharbour.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-7681";"Niro Gratas? By the Divines, what does he want now? Uh, th-thank you. \n\nOh … here's some coin. It's all I have. I hope it's enough."
"116521668-0-7683";"By Mara's golden tresses! Never expected to see those. Ordered them to woo Domitia here but turns out she married me anyway. I suppose I owe you for bringing them. Maybe Dommy will want them, wet though they are."
"116521668-0-7685";"Rasha! Many years have passed since we warred together. The sands of Sentinel, where we met—two young warriors who faced the world together.\n\nThe smell of this sand evokes golden days. But those times are done, for me at least."
"116521668-0-7686";"Thank the Divines. I don't even want to think what might have happened if the Engine's affliction had spread outside of the caverns.\n\nThank you for your help. We can handle it from here. Barring any more attacks from the cavern wildlife."
"116521668-0-7695";"We've opened a portal to the city. Feel free to use it, if you want.\n\nWe're in your debt. Without your help, the others would still be locked away—or worse. We'll get to safety and begin stabilizing the portals to Nirn right away."
"116521668-0-7704";"<<1>>'s contingent left to investigate the Dominion presence in <<2>>. A short time ago, lamia boiled out of the ruins."
"116521668-0-7705";"What else? It's time to fight! You have the credentials, so you've already met the division champions. Now you must fight through the ranks of their divisions. \n\nSurvive that and you'll face the Grand Champion. But first things first. Get moving now."
"116521668-0-7706";"This is it … your chance to take on the Grand Champion. May the luck of Jone and Jode be with you."
"116521668-0-7707";"You have one title under your belt. Gain the other two division titles and you'll have the chance to unseat Ishalga, our Grand Champion. May the luck of Baan Dar continue to follow you."
"116521668-0-7708";"Keep it up. You will give Ishalga quite a challenge if she faces you in the Grand Championship.\n\nMay Riddle'Thar be kind when he determines your fate."
"116521668-0-7709";"Look at you. A fighter from humble beginnings, now the Grand Champion. You are a marvel, Mysterious Stranger. \n\nI hope one day you will return to defend your title. Until then, may Jone and Jode light your path."
"116521668-0-7710";"I cannot express how grateful I am. You have saved us, body and soul. May your steps on the two-moons dance bring you where you need to go."
"116521668-0-7711";"Yes! You're just the best. Working with you is like that Argonian bard at my local tavern. An unexpected but very welcome surprise."
"116521668-0-7713";"I knew you were the one I was waiting for!\n\nMolag Bal locked me away for a reason. He fears me. Once you set me free, we can make him regret the day he made us his enemies."
"116521668-0-7715";"Truly! Then thank S'rendarr you came along. Tamriel is free of another shaveskin muskarse, and Tand is returned to me. Bright Moons and long life to you, walker. We will remember you, always!"
"116521668-0-7720";"Yes. Of course. I have been waiting for you for some time. The story needs you to play a part in the present … and in the past."
"116521668-0-7721";"Great. A fan.\n\nI need you to keep quiet!"
"116521668-0-7726";"My notebook! I thought it lost forever. I must have left it at one of the wells I was researching. Fascinating, aren't they?\n\nWith these notes, perhaps I can finish my book on Ayleid wells throughout Cyrodiil. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-7727";"Ha! That sneaky Tamien fellow sure will be surprised.\n\nHopefully now, Lady Laurent will forgive me and realize we don't need any hired help. A mercenary … what in Oblivion was she thinking?"
"116521668-0-7728";"Here's half, along with my gratitude—which can be quite valuable in certain circles!\n\nI hope we cross paths again. Next time, I'll be the one doing you a good turn. You can count on it."
"116521668-0-7733";"My robes! They were stolen en route from my tailor in Faregyl. I've worn holes in my only other set. I'm sure you can imagine the jokes at my expense.\n\nWhat bandits wanted with my robes is beyond me."
"116521668-0-7734";"Excellent! I knew she'd come through for me. Best news I've had in months. Here's your coin, hope you live long enough to spend it."
"116521668-0-7743";"Ahzirr traajijazeri—""we justly take by force."" At <<1>>, we study the thin line between justice and vengeance. We train so we will always know the difference.\n\nEnjoy your life, walker. You never know when those you love can slip away."
"116521668-0-7744";"I knew he wouldn't give up. He won't come home until he finds Donus. I'll know if anything happens to either of them, I'm sure of it. Still, your news is good and I thank you. Take this for your trouble."
"116521668-0-7747";"Indeed. For all you've done for our little community, you have my thanks. You are most welcome in Greenhill, from this day forth."
"116521668-0-7748";"Indeed. For all you've done for our little community, you have my thanks. You are most welcome in Greenhill, from this day forth. I hope future days here will feature less heartache and sorrow."
"116521668-0-7750";"My flute! I sold it after the earthquake ruined my home. It killed me to part with it, but I needed money for repairs. \n\nNot that it helped, with the continual tremors and monster attacks."
"116521668-0-7752";"I'm certain. But no one else shall fall into their trap.\n\nYou managed what I could not. But it is done, which is all that matters."
"116521668-0-7753";"An old trinket, but this one always felt it brought her some luck. Perhaps it's what led us to meet at this shrine!\n\nA true pleasure. It would be good to meet again, yes?"
"116521668-0-7754";"Please come and play again!"
"116521668-0-7755";"Come back again, there's more blood to be shed!"
"116521668-0-7756";"No, thank you! I learn more about this game every time I see someone run.\n\nYou should consider playing spikeball professionally."
"116521668-0-7757";"Let me see that. I'm sure he wants gold, the deadbeat. \n\nHe fled to the abbey to avoid creditors and now he wants my help to return? I don't think so. This is his mess, not mine."
"116521668-0-7758";"The kwama will soon learn the cave is their nest and treat the spirit as their queen. Together, they'll guard the cave against intruders who seek to harm the Great Tree.\n\nA new story can frighten any creature, until it realizes its role within."
"116521668-0-7759";"Thank you. You move a great weight off of the heart of a dying man.\n\nThe future of our tribe … our honor … depends on you fulfilling our duty and fighting … the Withered Hand."
"116521668-0-7761";"Ha! Nice of Marcellus to let me know he found me. Lucky for me, I've made enough in Cheydinhal to disappear again.\n\nHere, take this for your trouble. And remember, you never saw me."
"116521668-0-7767";"Kargand will live and by my claws, I promise he will defeat this corruption. I thank you for freeing us. Know peace in your journeys."
"116521668-0-7770";"Truly, your coming was a gift from Mara herself! To confess the truth, I feared I'd sent you to your death. My faith was being tested. I see that now. Thank you, and go with the love of Mara."
"116521668-0-7773";"How thoughtful of you both! Mansa knows cold-water fish are my favorite. A simple pleasure in these troubled times.\n\nPlease accept something for your efforts."
"116521668-0-7774";"I knew you were the one I was waiting for!\n\nMolag Bal locked me away for a reason. He fears me. Once you set me free, we can make him regret the day he made us his enemies."
"116521668-0-7776";"I think I've done all I can. You're pretty tough—tougher than me, at least. You may be ready for the next fight, but I'm going to need a few minutes.\n\nGo on, though. With you on our side, this whole Maormer thing will be over quick, I imagine."
"116521668-0-7777";"I thought I'd never see this again! When the Goblins attacked, I panicked and ran. If I'd known how desperately I'd need my instruments here, I would have held onto my bag.\n\nThank you for returning it to me!"
"116521668-0-7778";"Finally. I needed those a week ago. I'm going to have to find a new supplier if Saldir can't deliver on time.\n\nThis is for your trouble."
"116521668-0-7783";"I knew you were the one I was waiting for!\n\nWhatever your purpose here, I can help you. Especially if it has anything to do with ruining Molag Bal's day."
"116521668-0-7794";"Keep your voice down! Apphia was a mistake, a one-time thing. That's why I sent the fool girl away.\n\nIf my wife finds out, she'll carve me a new smile! Take this and forget all about it."
"116521668-0-7798";"Yes. The words have been spoken. \n\nNormally my father would conduct a small ceremony and speak the words … but his spirit moved on while you were unconscious. His last request was that you and I would destroy the Withered Hand."
"116521668-0-7799";"Yes. The words have been spoken. \n\nNormally my father would conduct a small ceremony and speak the words … but his spirit moved on while you were unconscious. His last request was that you and I would destroy the Withered Hand."
"116521668-0-7800";"Every member of the Dominion is a little safer because of what we've done here today. Queen Ayrenn's not here to give you a fancy scepter, or a royal title. Just me.\n\nBut, from me … thanks."
"116521668-0-7804";"I'll see to the Staff of Magnus's safety myself.\n\nAs for you, the Bosmer have their Silvenar. With both the Silvenar and the Green Lady, it's time the two became one. Go to Velyn Harbor in Malabal Tor and we will make preparations."
"116521668-0-7812";"Give me that, quickly. If the Imperials see it, we're both dead!\n\nPoor Belya. I'm afraid I lured him to his death. At least now I know not to wait for him any longer. Thank you for delivering this."
"116521668-0-7818";"Well, if anyone can survive the planes of Oblivion, it's a Vinedusk Ranger.  Nara's tougher than wood.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-7823";"Jone and Jode dance kindly with you, walker. Whatever the findings of our esteemed Inspector, we're in your debt!"
"116521668-0-7829";"Truly? Well, at this point that should come as no surprise. Nonetheless, I will wait until later to give him this news. \n\nHis Majesty is dealing with a crisis here in Sentinel. You might be able to help him … if you are so inclined."
"116521668-0-7830";"Thank you. I'll destroy this immediately.\n\nMy sister is all I have left. We'll learn to forgive each other. We have to, if we are going to rebuild."
"116521668-0-7831";"That sack of skooma bought your freedom, and a reward for your cooperation.\n\nNow, stand aside. I've got business with these Khajiit."
"116521668-0-7832";"Thank you so much! With everything that happened at Pell's Gate, I was afraid I'd never see her again. Please, take this with my gratitude."
"116521668-0-7836";"What! I knew I shouldn't have trusted that fool to get her here. Now I'm going to have to find someone else to marry me. It wasn't easy getting Munya to agree. When Fabanil gets here, I'm going to beat him bloody."
"116521668-0-7847";"This one knows, Hallowed. Former Mane Akkhuz-ri is here. Preparations have begun. Your path to the Two Moons Dance begins here and now."
"116521668-0-7861";"Damn his stubborness! And yet, I love him for his sense of honor.\n\nI must go. The others are waiting. <<1>> will remain, the caretaker of our only link with Tamriel. I'll make sure our child knows him, and what he gave up to protect our way of life."
"116521668-0-7863";"Long may you prosper, wayfarer. You have lifted a great burden from me."
"116521668-0-7871";"We were lucky to have the help of a five-clawed one such as yourself. I appreciate all you have done for me.\n\nNow, though it pains me, I must free my brother from his suffering. Good luck to you."
"116521668-0-7876";"You did well, my friend. Thanks to your efforts, we control the Chasm and can freely move troops between the Hollow City and the front lines.\n\nTake a moment to collect your thoughts, then come see me again. This gauntlet we must run is far from over."
"116521668-0-7888";"Ah, good! Arcarin promised these yesterday; we are always running low.\n\nI have been instructing new recruits on the use of siege weapons. Much ammunition is wasted."
"116521668-0-7892";"You're always welcome here, warrior. But now, others need to speak with you."
"116521668-0-7893";"The rest is best learned through experience. The mission boards contain Grand Warlord Sorcalin's latest orders. Atahba suggests a Scouting mission to start.\n\nWelcome to the war!"
"116521668-0-7899";"I know that handwriting. This is a note I hoped never to receive. But I thank you for delivering it to me."
"116521668-0-7910";"A priestess of the … all right. Hey, we need to get things done here. Whatever brought you up the road, I'm not going to complain."
"116521668-0-7911";"But then, enough about the past. Khali has already laughed at my attempts to write down what happened. We have much more dangerous, immediate threats ahead of us."
"116521668-0-7912";"Yes, I know. Her sister told us a tale of bravery and sacrifice. She said you played an important role … as you so often do. I wish we could offer you a chance to rest and recover. But rest will have to wait for another day."
"116521668-0-7915";"May Jone and Jode guard your steps, and keep you safe in the trials to come."
"116521668-0-7918";"This one is just a humble priest. Who is she to question the judgment of the First Mane? <<1>> must congratulate you … and express her regrets. The path of the Hallowed will not be an easy one to walk."
"116521668-0-7919";"This one is just a humble priest. Who is she to question the judgment of the First Mane? <<1>> must congratulate you … and express her regrets. The path of the Hallowed will not be an easy one to walk."
"116521668-0-7921";"So you know. Look, my gift is under control; I won't hurt anyone. If my former family comes looking for me, I'll move on.\n\nHere, take this for your silence."
"116521668-0-7922";"Yes. Thanks to your efforts and my remarkable magical talents, we've turned these vampires into mindless beasts. They won't give us any more trouble.\n\nThis brings us one step closer to the planar vortex and ending the Planemeld."
"116521668-0-7924";"The Wilderking could create a new tree in its place, or perhaps now we're meant to stay in paradise.\n\nIf <<A:1>> survives, we'll return again, and I'll know my decision was correct. If we never return, at least I'll be with my family to the end."
"116521668-0-7926";"That idiot! I'm done with him and his stupid plans. I told him that when I left; he never listens to me. I love it here and I'm not leaving. Sorry my brother wasted your time. Here's some coin for your trouble."
"116521668-0-7928";"Not if I have anything to say about it. I know what this is, Hallowed. These visions … they're a future where the Mane does not lead her people. With wisdom as well as strength. This will not be our future."
"116521668-0-7929";"Bright Moons, Hallowed. Wherever Jone and Jode take you next, I hope you will remember your friend Khali. And her sister Shazah. The sisters, and the Khajiit … they will never forget you."
"116521668-0-7930";"We did. And we truly cannot thank you enough. Without your help, none of us would have escaped that horrible place."
"116521668-0-7933";"Took your time, didn't you? Olvyia mentioned she sent a recruit to fetch these. Since you're here, we could show you the siege weapons."
"116521668-0-7934";"Your time here is done; others need to speak to you."
"116521668-0-7935";"There's always more to learn, but the battlefields will be your teacher from this point on. The mission boards await. Start with a Scouting mission; you're less likely to die on one of those.\n\nWelcome to the war."
"116521668-0-7936";"Finally! Zahreh promised these yesterday; we're always running low.\n\nThank you for delivering them."
"116521668-0-7937";"Others need to speak with you now, warrior."
"116521668-0-7938";"Battle is the best teacher, warrior. Accept missions posted to the boards, experience the lands of Cyrodiil, and advance the Covenant cause. I suggest you start with a Scouting mission.\n\nHonor and faith be with you always!"
"116521668-0-7942";"Most certainly. Thanks to your efforts, my children are free. They won't give you any more trouble.\n\nAnd, as I promised, my children will aid you when you need it most."
"116521668-0-7957";"Clearly, you were meant to help us out. Jone and Jode have a sense of humor, yes? And, of course, Raz thinks discretion deserves a reward."
"116521668-0-7971";"A noble notion, I suppose, but nothing can justify the murder of innocents. She will pay for her crimes.\n\nYou've done quite a service for our fair city. I'm not one for emotional displays of appreciation, but you have my gratitude."
"116521668-0-7972";"I would encourage you to finish whatever business you have in Bergama and then be on your way.\n\nIn time, it will become clear that we have done the right thing. Until then, gods be with you."
"116521668-0-7989";"Thank you—I appreciate your trust. We'll have to act fast, but the loyal troops and I will get this camp cleaned up on the double. \n\nI think the Covenant will be proud of us."
"116521668-0-7990";"Go forth from this place with the blessings of the Bright Moons. We will always remember the honor you did the dead today."
"116521668-0-7994";"Selene's soul is mine, now. Today is a historic one for the Guild.\n\nI'll ensure my fallen colleagues receive honorable mentions in the next codex I write."
"116521668-0-7995";"I knew you were the one I was waiting for!\n\nWhatever your purpose here, I can help you. Especially if it has anything to do with ruining Molag Bal's day. I have heard many secrets during my time here, and I shall share them with you."
"116521668-0-7997";"Pelidil? Then it's true. He's betrayed us. My brother's body didn't make it to Marbruk either. I knew he loved Naemon dearly, but I didn't think he'd stoop to this.\n\nI will once again require your aid."
"116521668-0-8005";"He's a tough one. And if he survives, maybe he'll stop griping about his postings.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-8014";"Safely returned to its home in Apocrypha. I would not risk you against its secrets.\n\nBut I will not leave you empty-handed."
"116521668-0-8018";"You've done my people a great service, friend. You may stay and learn the stories of these people with me, if you desire."
"116521668-0-8023";"We will go to the Hollow City. Some of the villagers may decide to stay here, where it's familiar, but that will be their choice.  \n\nI grieve for the lost, but it's not in a Nord's nature to just give up. Thank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-8036";"I'll lead any villagers that wish to join me to the Hollow City. A few may decide to remain here, where it's familiar, but that's up to them.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever forgive my father. He can remain here and help anyone who wanders in."
"116521668-0-8042";"Of course. The Prowler's been sitting at dock too long. She's ready to pounce on that bastard Pelidil as soon as we catch him.\n\nAnd catch him soon we will—you have the captain's word on it!"
"116521668-0-8049";"Wonder of wonders! Her ring shows you speak the truth. And these are the stolen gems? They will prove her innocence!\n\nI can bury my wife with honor beside our family! This is more than I ever hoped! Thank you. Thank you so much!"
"116521668-0-8052";"Thanks to you. The touch of a Daedric prince is enough to muddy any water. I look forward to working with Master Pircalmo. We could really use someone of his expertise. May the Green guide your steps."
"116521668-0-8057";"You found it! How wonderful! Oh, I missed my lute, F'lah, so much! Oh, thank you!\n\nI feel so happy. I think I want to play a song now. Oh, F'lah, let's make some beautiful music together!"
"116521668-0-8062";"Indeed. We have fought alongside many of the same soldiers and word travels quickly when it involves heroics such as those attributed to you.\n\nI have anticipated the chance to meet you in person, and I am pleased the opportunity has finally arrived."
"116521668-0-8065";"Stand back then, mate, while I put on the crown. \n\nIf I turn on you, strike me down. Do it quick-like, there's a good chum."
"116521668-0-8066";"Damn and blast. Destroy the thing and be done with it, then."
"116521668-0-8067";"This one's beloved <<1>> dropped it while we ran from the Dremora. Ahirunz never thought he would see it again. It must be a sign! Ernabi doesn't want this one to give up.\n\nThank you. Thank you for giving Ahirunz the strength to go on living."
"116521668-0-8069";"You did? I knew it! That's wonderful! I can't thank you enough.\n\nNow I won't wind up like the rest of these poor wretches. I have my soul back and I'm getting out of here!"
"116521668-0-8070";"I won't forget what you did for me. Even a loyal servant can withstand the charms of a beautiful, winged Daedra for only so long, you know.\n\nI saw a city from the top of the tower. I'll head there and try to find my dear Lady Laurent."
"116521668-0-8071";"What? Those incompetents let trolls take the mine? That's terrible! I'm ruined! I'll have to hire sellswords to clear the mine and … bah! Thank you for telling me, I suppose. Here's something for your trouble. Now, if you'll excuse me …."
"116521668-0-8074";"I'm a skeleton of me word, so here, take this. \n\nNow be off with ya. I got some vengeance to bestow on them what busted me up."
"116521668-0-8078";"I am prepared to lose my memories, but I don't want to lose the lessons I've learned. \n\nYou helped me understand the difference between a foe and a friend. I'm determined not to forget that, nor to forget you."
"116521668-0-8079";"Excellent. My latest orders are posted to the mission boards by Generals Thoron and Atahba. Look at the notices, find a mission that fits your abilities, and do it. I suggest you start with a Scouting mission.\n\nWelcome to the war!"
"116521668-0-8083";"Well, if there's one thing I know, it's that you, my friend, have done your duty here, and then some. You covered the behinds of all the cowards who abandoned the place.\n\nThe Covenant needs more people like you. I mean that."
"116521668-0-8105";"It will go on, as it always has. Except now we can say without hesitation that we follow the just path, no matter the hardships.\n\nThe old masters would have been proud."
"116521668-0-8106";"It will go on, as it always has. Let it not be said that we shirk our responsibility when need arises.\n\nI will make Master Fa … that is, the former masters, proud."
"116521668-0-8111";"Much needs to be done for the Pact to control Cyrodiil. I send the most urgent tasks to be posted on the mission boards for all to see. Scouting missions are best to start with.\n\nWelcome to the war."
"116521668-0-8124";"I hope you never doubted our success, my friend. Between your skills and my formidable magical prowess, there was no way we could fail.\n\nIt appears we aren't as finished as I had hoped, however. Cadwell claims we have more to do to save Nirn."
"116521668-0-8125";"Was there ever any doubt? Between your skills and my formidable magical prowess, the destruction of the Shackle was a foregone conclusion.\n\nWe aren't finished yet, however. Cadwell claims that we have more to do if we are to truly save Nirn."
"116521668-0-8126";"Of course! We accomplished exactly what we set out to do. Thanks to your help and my considerable magical power, the Great Shackle is no more!\n\nWe can't return home just yet, however. Cadwell claims that Molag Bal has one more arrow in his quiver."
"116521668-0-8127";"Yes, my friend. With your help and thanks to my considerable power, we destroyed the Great Shackle!\n\nBut we can't celebrate just yet. Cadwell claims that Molag Bal has one more trick up his sleeve that we still have to deal with."
"116521668-0-8132";"Excellent. The missions most important to the Covenant are posted on the mission boards. Find one that appeals to you and do it. A Scouting mission would be a good place to start.\n\nWelcome to the war!"
"116521668-0-8147";"I think so. Thanks to you. I need to find Lady Laurent and make sure she's all right. She can get so flustered without me. \n\nI'll lead Fatahala to the Hollow City. Those dueling lessons were certainly worth the gold!"
"116521668-0-8152";"I want you to … to have this. A gift from my people to the hero of Nirn. To honor you … and those who fell beside me in this great battle. Thank … thank you.\n\nMay the … spirits … guide me on my … way …."
"116521668-0-8160";"We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.\n\nI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again."
"116521668-0-8161";"We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.\n\nI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again."
"116521668-0-8162";"This one knows, Hallowed. The priestess is already here. Preparations have begun. Your path to the Two Moons Dance begins here, and now."
"116521668-0-8169";"Thank you for bringing me this message, albeit the scholar's apprentice was lost to me in the fighting. Regrettably, I fear that young Shiri was most likely … slain.\n\nOf course, until you arrived, I believed we would soon share her fate."
"116521668-0-8178";"We'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-8179";"When Tharn returns, we will combine our resources. We will find a path to these Halls of Torment soon enough."
"116521668-0-8184";"Give her to me. I still need to return their eggs, so I'll take her as well.\n\nLooks like I'll be around for a while. Though we disagree on many things, my father will need help regaining the town's trust. And, I miss this place. Harpies and all."
"116521668-0-8186";"Every new member. Sort of a rite of passage. You survived our song. Hopefully, you'll survive the beasts and the bastards waiting in the deeps—to kill you!"
"116521668-0-8193";"The Maormer are fled or dead, thanks to your efforts. <<1>> is safe, and voluntarily a part of the Aldmeri Dominion.\n\nSo, if you must know? <<2>> keeps an eye on promising people."
"116521668-0-8194";"No. I will stay aboard the Prowler. I miss her greatly when we are apart, so I will celebrate our victory here on deck with my crew … and several bottles of Moon-Sugar Double Rum.\n\nYou go on. Savor this victory. You certainly earned it."
"116521668-0-8197";"Absolutely! You've brought the best news I've heard in several weeks. Enjoy your trophy."
"116521668-0-8199";"Then we cannot allow these people to remain. The last thing the Dominion needs is rebellious elements near its capital city.\n\nI don't enjoy making this decision, but thank you for helping me see its necessity."
"116521668-0-8200";"Then that's all I need for my report. My superiors won't be happy, but I'm sure they'll get used to the idea eventually.\n\nThank you for seeing the truth of the matter. I hope to have those wretched wooden barricades down within the month."
"116521668-0-8213";"Good! As you can see, I have <<1>>. With my help, he might even become a good swindler someday.\n\nAnything would be better than staying in that camp. It's difficult to be the daughter of a man known as ""the Ungodly."""
"116521668-0-8216";"I'm not surprised that you didn't find anything. It takes keen eyes and an educated mind to fully identify significant artifacts.\n\nI may just abandon this site and go deeper in the desert anyway. I heard there were burial sites …."
"116521668-0-8218";"I may not seem appreciative, but really, this would have been very difficult without your help.\n\nAzei can pack up our camp now and we'll .… Hmm. Did you hear something? Sounds like the wind's picking up a bit …."
"116521668-0-8226";"Here you go, mortal! Don't go around saying Sheogorath cheats on a deal. He does, sometimes. But not today! It's been … fun. Let's do this again real soon, all right?"
"116521668-0-8232";"<You rummage through the backpack and find the payment Thonoras pledged to provide.>"
"116521668-0-8233";"<You rummage through the backpack and find the payment Thonoras pledged to provide.>"
"116521668-0-8236";"We've taken them down a notch! The more bones they send us, the more we'll have to fight them. Bet the Wormies never thought they'd be on the other end of it, eh?"
"116521668-0-8237";"See the world, I expect. Folks may not take kindly to chattering Elf bones, but it's better than stomping everything to jelly, eh?"
"116521668-0-8238";"For now. These necromancers seem slow to learn and deserve everything we give them.\n\nBut we'll keep watch for another decade, just to be certain."
"116521668-0-8245";"How odd that the Dremora aided us against her kyn and Molag Bal. She must have had a powerful thirst for vengeance.\n\nAnyway, it appears as if we are once again in your debt. Thank you, my brave friend."
"116521668-0-8257";"Now all that remains is to finish my last few paragraphs, and go speak to Meldil. I'm sure he'll be annoyed with me. But with the relics in-hand and my sterling prose, I'm sure this is the start of a brave new chapter in my life. All thanks to you!"
"116521668-0-8265";"You must have found the murderer himself. Since you're still alive, I assume he's dead.\n\nGood. I've been trying to find him for years. You've earned the pay I took from the families."
"116521668-0-8266";"In time, our city will recover. Perhaps we'll parley with the Dominion and return to our people.\n\nBut for now, we'll have our hands full trying to close this damned Oblivion Gate."
"116521668-0-8275";"Through you, the Ansei Wards have been recovered, and so it will be through you they are restored."
"116521668-0-8282";"Bright moons! It's been a privilege to fight by your side. I know now why Rid-Thar would choose you. Why he appeared to us. You are the Moon Hallowed. You must be!"
"116521668-0-8289";"You did it? You must be stronger than you look. \n\nThank you for avenging my hunting party and making the area safer for all. I don't have much, but take this as my thanks to you."
"116521668-0-8290";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8293";"Individually, the leaders are rational, even reasonable. But get them together, and … well, you'll see soon enough."
"116521668-0-8296";"Rotten luck. They arrived in Coldharbour, but in entirely different locations. Bloody unpredictable, portals to Oblivion. Not to mention Molag Bal's defenses.\n\nNasty beasties abound. Off you go. Over the bridge and head inland. There's a good chap!"
"116521668-0-8297";"A spider Daedra? Could these mines be any more cursed? This was a fool's errand. Once I return to Sentinel I'll never leave again!\n\nSep's coils are never-ending, friend. I'm sure you did what you could for them."
"116521668-0-8298";"Who? That's a silly name. I don't owe him money, do I?\n\nSorry. I don't know you or your buddy <<1>>. Guess you did something to help me, though, or you wouldn't be talking to me."
"116521668-0-8302";"You've done the Dominion a great service. No doubt he was feeding the Pact information about our troop movements. That's lives saved.\n\nWe'll clear out any Pact dumb enough to remain in the area. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8308";"At last. And the more beautiful for the longed-for rest it brings.\n\nWhen I was young, I implored Hircine to let me hunt his finest beast. That ensured I was restless and deathless. Until today. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8316";"This is a blight on our community. Our own innkeeper, responsible for leading visitors to bandits? Bad hospitality.\n\nThank you for bringing him to us. We'll see he gets what he deserves."
"116521668-0-8318";"She … what? Where is this tribe? I can't just let her go. I … I will join her. I can live in the forest. I … who am I kidding? \n\nThis is my fault. Our relationship was always harder on her than it was on me. At least I know she's okay."
"116521668-0-8319";"I wish you'd accompanied her, but she is strong. Like … like a stampede of mammoths.\n\nI know, I should stick to administrative work. Thank you so much."
"116521668-0-8320";"Dammit, Fanrel. She should have gotten our help. The Faithful should be avenged—but she will never succeed on her own.\n\nBut I can't blame you for wanting to keep your hands clean. You've done more than we can repay. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8321";"The butchers got what they had coming to them. Word will spread, and the Wood Orcs will think twice about settling the Falinesti sites and slaughtering the faithful.\n\nThank you for your help."
"116521668-0-8333";"I knew she wouldn't forget me! I hope things are going better for her then they are for me."
"116521668-0-8334";"Just like Dinie to send someone after the fun is over! Well at least for the Veiled Heritance anyway.\n\nStill, it's good that you're here."
"116521668-0-8335";"Ah Dinie. Can't get me out of her head, can she? I knew she cared."
"116521668-0-8350";"We'll see about that. But you have done as was asked, and will have your gold as we agreed. The noble Bashshi-ra appreciates your service … and your discretion."
"116521668-0-8351";"Excellent. I wish I could see the look on Angore's face when I take these to market. I bought them, fair, after all.\n\nThank you for your help. Here's what I owe you. Unlike Angore, I keep to a deal."
"116521668-0-8353";"Words of gratitude are nice and all, but as a fellow adventurer I know they don't fill the belly. Here, some coin for your trouble."
"116521668-0-8354";"The past, present, and future are stark, stripped of illusion. And I am left with more questions.\n\nI will have to find a new way to exist, neither living nor dead, neither doubting nor believing."
"116521668-0-8355";"All of what you have told me, I somehow knew. I felt it to be true. I hoped it would be true.\n\nI will no longer dread the unknown. You have lifted darkness out of me. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8356";"Thank Stendarr! Things were getting tense. I know you're not the Artisan, thanks to our careful investigations. You're free to go now.\n\nWe'll return the items back to their original owners."
"116521668-0-8372";"The Eyes see all, my friend. That doesn't mean they speak. Go talk to Cariel. She'll get you hooked up with our friends in the resistance."
"116521668-0-8373";"You have been drawn here to participate in a great ceremony, Hallowed. Up the stairs behind me you will find the priest Hadam-do. He is a respected member of our order. He will lead you to the temple within."
"116521668-0-8376";"When you've lived your life in the shadow of the Bright Moons, nothing is strange any longer. I'm just glad you're here with us now, Hallowed."
"116521668-0-8380";"Now I've got to return to Telenger empty handed. Believe it or not, the old sage was pulling for that little fool. So it goes. The Stars turn in the sky and with them turn the whims of Telenger the Artificer. Good luck."
"116521668-0-8400";"Good. Then at least now her spirit can make the journey to the Far Shores.\n\nIf only—no, it does no good to dwell on what might have been. This is enough. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8402";"May Jone, Jode, and Yenadar watch you on the road. Kala's brother will be guiding your steps. She can feel it."
"116521668-0-8403";"Good luck on the road. And if you find Kala's brother before she does, tell him he will need the blessings of Jone and Jode both to avoid my claws. Bah!"
"116521668-0-8405";"Jone and Jode dance in the heavens! Soon Nirnroot wine will flow out to the thirsty people of Cyrodiil, and riches will flow back to Thalara."
"116521668-0-8406";"I knew I could count on you. The minute I saw your face, I said to myself, ""Wilminn, all your troubles are over."" Bless your honest soul.\n\nNow just hand over that ash and take your reward, with my heartfelt thanks!"
"116521668-0-8407";"Zeht's blessings upon you! Soon Nirnroot wine shall fill my casks and customers will flock to my brewery again.\n\nAccept these offerings in thanks, friend."
"116521668-0-8408";"Thank you. I'll treasure this always. I'll always remember your kindness. And the inspiration of my ancestors."
"116521668-0-8410";"Thank you, thank you for looking past this little indiscretion of mine. I promise it won't happen again.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm truly sorry for the pain I caused."
"116521668-0-8415";"It's going to be like that, is it? Fine. I'll escort him to Captain Lucius myself. Maybe they'll see sense and burn him at the stake. Or maybe they'll let him go free.\n\nWhatever happens now is on your head."
"116521668-0-8416";"More sad news? This wretched domain is full of it. \n\nStill, it's better to know what happened to <<1>> than to wonder what fate befell her. Thank you for that."
"116521668-0-8421";"The Thronekeepers are broken.\n\nStill, to consecrate the dead is my duty, and Tava's was once my home. I will go to them."
"116521668-0-8423";"It's a painful loss. Aranak was an important part of this community. He gave us contact with the outside world.\n\nI hope you'll be able to fill that role for us. You're welcome here always."
"116521668-0-8424";"He did? I could never have guessed how desperate our situation has become, but he was correct nonetheless.\n\nI'm glad you are here with us. I know Prince Azah feels the same."
"116521668-0-8427";"Old Raz sent you, eh? That could complicate things. Thank you for telling me. The Queen's enemies are all around her. Her protectors must be vigilant at all times, and this information will be critical in their calculations."
"116521668-0-8434";"I see. So the rumors were true. Pelidil ….\n\nIt is good that you brought him to his end. But I hope you aren't too weary, my Eye. Pelidil may be gone, but his actions are being felt across Valenwood. We have much left to do."
"116521668-0-8438";"Not if I have anything to say about it. I know what this is, Hallowed. These visions … they're a future where the Mane does not lead her people. With strength as well as wisdom. This will not be our future."
"116521668-0-8439";"And I'm proud to be standing with you. Ahem. Now then. Let's focus our wits, and prepare. Let's walk the Path and see this through. The way Khali would have wanted."
"116521668-0-8447";"Bright Moons, Hallowed. Wherever Jone and Jode take you next, I hope you will remember your friend Shazah. And her sister Khali. The sisters, and the Khajiit … they will never forget you."
"116521668-0-8453";"Excellent! Here's your payment.\n\nI expect our dear friend will be back any moment. So, if you would like to stick around, it's sure to be an entertaining spectacle."
"116521668-0-8455";"In this matter, nothing. Abnur and I must confer. We will contact you again when we have more information. \n\nI did not foresee Abnur's defection, but I welcome it. Mannimarco fears him—and with good reason. He can help us. I feel certain of it."
"116521668-0-8476";"You destroyed the creature? And even took its head for a trophy, I see. Huh, impressive. \n\nThank you for avenging my companions. I'll take the head if you don't mind. I should prepare a meal and say a prayer for my fallen friends."
"116521668-0-8483";"Not bad. Not bad at all, to kill a rare specimen such as that. You'd make a fine member of the Hounds someday. They're a company of trophy hunters. I've been with them for years now and I've never seen anyone as quick a study as you."
"116521668-0-8484";"That's a relief. I couldn't have lived with myself if it had killed you. You'd make a pretty good Hound, you know. Thanks!"
"116521668-0-8485";"Fantastic! Well done! Of course, I can't exactly take credit for the kill. But I think I understand tracking better now that I've seen you do it. You're a natural!"
"116521668-0-8488";"I'm glad you see things my way. When I think about all the suffering caused by this man and his children ….\n\nNever again. The Pellingare line ends today."
"116521668-0-8496";"Forgive me. Bringing you into my mind seems to have taken quite a toll on me. I must rest. \n\nI will contact you when the time is right. Until then, walk in the light Vestige."
"116521668-0-8499";"When the Planemeld has been thwarted and the dust has settled, the Five Companions shall gather one last time to face our destinies.\n\nThe God of Schemes must be stopped, Vestige. That is the only thing that matters now."
"116521668-0-8500";"This is amazing! Our family used to be much more prominent back in my great-grandmother's day. Maybe her sword will turn our fortunes around. Maybe.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for bringing this to me."
"116521668-0-8501";"You may return here as often as you like, and anywhere you see the shrine of the Snake, you may seek Brackenleaf's blessing.\n\nCongratulations, friend."
"116521668-0-8502";"You may return here as often as you like, and anywhere you see the shrine of the Wolf, you may seek Brackenleaf's blessing.\n\nCongratulations, friend."
"116521668-0-8503";"You may return here as often as you like, and anywhere you see the shrine of the Tiger, you may seek Brackenleaf's blessing.\n\nCongratulations, friend."
"116521668-0-8516";"The path ahead of us is a dark one, but it pleases me to know that I shall walk that path with friends. \n\nMay we all rest a little easier tonight. I know I shall."
"116521668-0-8517";"I witnessed the Titan's assault and sensed the deaths of many innocents. It is a great and terrible loss.   \n\nSai Sahan and the others will need time to aid Kasura. I will contact you when they return and we will begin the journey to Sancre Tor."
"116521668-0-8521";"Yes, you're right. I know you're right. I need to think about this.\n\nPlease, just leave me alone."
"116521668-0-8522";"What a thoughtful person you are, coming all this way to give me this news. Thank you.\n\nNow, if you don't mind, I need to be alone for awhile."
"116521668-0-8535";"Blood is thicker than water, after all. With the money we'll get from this place, I can buy us a good home in Sentinel.\n\nOhama will welcome my sister, even after all this. She's beautiful that way."
"116521668-0-8536";"I've always been too hard on him. He's found a beautiful wife, and he's always cared for Father, all these years. He has done well for himself.\n\nFather would be proud."
"116521668-0-8537";"Stupendous. You have done a valuable service my friend, not just for Anenya, but for the guild as a whole … actually for all of Tamriel.\n\nThis relic's very dangerous and we can now ensure it is put somewhere safe."
"116521668-0-8553";"I knew something wasn't right. She had stopped eating. It made her ill. I wish she could have told me what was happening to her. Maybe I could have helped.\n\nRest in peace, Heloise. Rest in peace."
"116521668-0-8554";"I knew something was wrong. I tried to get her to talk to me. Maybe I could have done something and then she'd still be here.\n\nBut she's alive, right? That's something. When this business with Montclair is over, I'll find her. I'll bring her back."
"116521668-0-8557";"Despite what the Bishop told you … it is not here. Not yet, anyway. This one's fellow priest, Zaddo. He will get you moving again."
"116521668-0-8560";"I can't help but feel that losing our Spinner makes us twice-punished for this crime. Is it the sense of betrayal? Or knowing how hard he will be to replace?\n\nBut we are in your debt. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8561";"Gathiel was the gem of our village. It's still hard to believe—but who could blame her for wanting a cure to her illness? The Green Pact is a harsh burden, sometimes.\n\nStill, we are grateful to you. You're welcome here anytime."
"116521668-0-8568";"Even those who do not follow the light of the moons sometimes serve it. The agent shrouded in darkness nearby, the Wood Elf Orthoron? He can tell you where you must go."
"116521668-0-8578";"I'll open a portal so you can tell them directly. My servants will defend our home from trespassers, but shall not stray beyond the ruins above.\n\nIf they seek lost knowledge, <<Ac:1>> is a wonderful old ruin. And it isn't here."
"116521668-0-8579";"I don't know. But whatever it is, I'll be far away from here. <<1>> can't hurt me anymore.\n\nHere, I can open a portal so you can be with your friends. Tell them I'm sorry about the shades. As long as they stay away, they should be fine."
"116521668-0-8605";"The Veiled Heritance were using my notes? No. What have I done?\n\nI was young and foolish when I wrote these notes. I just wanted to save my wife from a consuming plague. I should've destroyed them then. I will destroy them now. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8611";"Being trapped in the tree was a fate worse than any death I can imagine. Though I once did all I could to extend my life, I am now grateful to be granted the peace of death.\n\nIf you were the one responsible for releasing me, then I thank you."
"116521668-0-8615";"This is delightful! World saved, heroes gone their separate ways, and this knight has a new mistress to serve. Bravo! Couldn't be happier! Smashing! Truly!"
"116521668-0-8616";"This is delightful! World saved, heroes gone their separate ways, and this knight has a new mistress to serve. Bravo! Couldn't be happier! Smashing! Truly!"
"116521668-0-8617";"This is delightful! World saved, heroes gone their separate ways, and this knight has a new mistress to serve. Bravo! Couldn't be happier! Smashing! Truly!"
"116521668-0-8618";"Yes. They are at peace. Even King Ranser, I suppose.\n\nHe was a wise and courageous king at one time, you know. I hope what happened here does not further damage his legacy. That is beyond my control, however. Goodbye, my friend, and thank you."
"116521668-0-8622";"I see. So their lust for power led them to their demise. A lesson every mage should take to heart. \n\nThank you for seeking me out about this. You've saved me much fruitless searching. It is good to know the matter is dealt with."
"116521668-0-8623";"Truly? You have all three? Quickly, let me see. Yes. These will do. Satisfactory. Here, take your payment.\n\nAt last, I can join my five-clawed brothers. I can be the predator I was born to be!"
"116521668-0-8626";"You will not be sorry, my friend. I assure you that my days of aiding man-eating serpents are over!"
"116521668-0-8627";"Thank you for bringing this simpering cur to me. If what you say is true, many dear friends fell to this dog's treachery. I look forward to returning the favor."
"116521668-0-8629";"Thank the Eight. The army here is greater than we anticipated."
"116521668-0-8630";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8632";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8633";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8634";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8635";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8636";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8637";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8638";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8639";"Comrade. I grow … very tired. My time here on Tamriel has gone on far too long. I go now to join my ancestors, to feast in the halls of those gone by. I go knowing that the Fighters Guild is in very good hands."
"116521668-0-8641";"Clan Morkul can add this to their long list of achievements. Their outlawry against the Covenant has damaged their reputation, but perhaps this will change that.\n\nRegardless, I just want to go home. Thank you for making that possible."
"116521668-0-8642";"Who would have thought it was Clan Agluk? They're all but extinct. To be honest, I think there are only a handful left. This may be just the thing to bring them back. \n\nRegardless, I just want to go home. Thank you for making that possible."
"116521668-0-8644";"The Wilderqueen, eh? Times are changing in Valenwood, aren't they? \n\nAll this has put the Dominion in a delicate position. I suppose that's why it's so important that we're here."
"116521668-0-8647";"Much, when it is time. You have taught humility to a Daedric Prince, mortal. Tread carefully, for he will attempt to exact his revenge.\n\nNow go, with my blessing. When I have need of you, you will know."
"116521668-0-8649";"I believe so, yes. I have much more reading to do before we get to that point, though.\n\nKnow that we wouldn't have this advantage if not for you. I could never have navigated Lleraya's veil without your help."
"116521668-0-8650";"Iniel … we were close, once. I wish I could've spoken to her one last time.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-8651";"Damn. She'd just joined us. I should not have allowed the Captain to take her.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-8652";"He was a fine soldier and a good friend. I'll remember his sacrifice. That's what he'd do for me.\n\nWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts."
"116521668-0-8653";"Yes. His death severed his connection with the town.\n\nI do hope Renoit makes it safely away, though I doubt anyone would believe his wild tales if he chose to speak about us. Another legend to hand down, I suppose."
"116521668-0-8654";"Maldred? That's the name of the … no. That unclawed traitor! Adusa only wishes she had been the one to end him!\n\nYou did well, five-claw. Adusa will see that these people reach a safe haven. Then I have business of my own to attend to."
"116521668-0-8672";"Of course not! Though I can blame myself no less. I am the one who trusted the fool.\n\nHe's apparently just a damn coward. You know, Eamond told me Renchant was naive. You've now given me proof of this fact."
"116521668-0-8674";"I sold some of the trolls' loot, of course.\n\nI suppose you're here looking for your cut. You certainly deserve it. Best of luck to you, friend."
"116521668-0-8679";"I don't know, but I can't put a price on your aid to me in this.\n\nYour actions make it clear to me that my choice to eschew responsibility and remain a squire wasn't the right one. I will never forget this lesson."
"116521668-0-8683";"I will. Once I've made arrangements, we will return to the city with our captive.\n\nShe was a good woman once, and in many ways still is. Whatever her fate, as it comes through my decisions, she deserves to look me in the eyes as it happens."
"116521668-0-8685";"Smart woman. Damn glad she's back in charge. Who'd have thought Duke Renchant was going to sell us all out? Guess he got what was coming to him.\n\nWe've got Reachmen to worry about now. Captain Gaercroft's in charge here—you should talk to him."
"116521668-0-8686";"No matter what the future holds, Evermore is deeply indebted to you, as I am too.\n\nIn times like these, we all need a hero like you … to remind us that no matter how bad things get, there's always hope."
"116521668-0-8687";"No matter what the future holds, Evermore is deeply indebted to you, as I am too.\n\nIn times like these, we all need a hero like you … to remind us that no matter how bad things get, there's always hope."
"116521668-0-8696";"You do? I was told the Knights of St. Pelin might return it, but with the attack on the garrison, I had given up.\n\nThis is … beyond amazing. I know King Fahara'jad will be grateful. And you have my personal thanks, as well."
"116521668-0-8698";"Draven needs to learn how to control his … power. I don't know where we'll go while he does. Somewhere far away from anyone else, where no one will question us.\n\nIf this is the life we must lead together, I'll gladly run with him."
"116521668-0-8704";"I have not forgotten, Vestige. It is another piece of the puzzle and we shall address it in due time. \n\nBut for now, let us rest and recover. As always, I will contact you soon. Walk in the light, Vestige."
"116521668-0-8716";"Think I don't remember, you daft little sprig? Call me a debt-hedger, will you? A deal-fondler?\n\nAh, but you're forgiven. I've always said grudges are like a good cheese. Hold them inside for too long, and you're the one to suffer."
"116521668-0-8717";"We did, did we?\n\nWell, I suppose you're right. Aulie and I could always visit. Perhaps during hurricane season! That would be delightful."
"116521668-0-8723";"Province General Auctor will be pleased. Sebazi is pleased as well. Your have earned your pay."
"116521668-0-8724";"The guild thanks you, comrade. Here is the reward for your efforts."
"116521668-0-8725";"You have turned back a little of Cyrodiil's darkness, comrade. Sebazi honors you!"
"116521668-0-8726";"That is indeed good news. Thank you for your efforts."
"116521668-0-8727";"Well, that's something at least. I like hearing about piles of corpses, but you earned your reward."
"116521668-0-8728";"I remember now. Good. That'll keep Province General Auctor happy for a while. Maybe I'll go bash in a few heads myself. We'll see."
"116521668-0-8729";"Excellent! Best news I've heard all day. You're a credit to the guild, comrade."
"116521668-0-8730";"Good, though some ears would have been nice. Anyway, the guild appreciates your efforts. Keep up the good work, comrade!"
"116521668-0-8731";"I am glad to hear it. The guild's reputation rests in the hands of its members; you have represented us well this day."
"116521668-0-8732";"Modesty befits a hero. You do honor to the guild, comrade. I look forward to working with you again."
"116521668-0-8733";"I deem your contract fulfilled. Accept this reward from a grateful guild."
"116521668-0-8734";"You have done well. The people of Cyrodiil will sleep better tonight for your efforts. And the guild is not ungrateful …."
"116521668-0-8745";"More than that! The rocks themselves give me strength! I feel immortal!\n\nAh, apologies my friend. This power, it's heady. Like a deep, cold pool. Refreshing, but so easy to fall into! I have much to learn, it seems!"
"116521668-0-8746";"We know as much as any creature of the forest does. We know because we trust the wild to be as it should, and to honor the rite of predator and prey.\n\nThat is all the wyrd wish of any creature, man or beast. And now, we have it."
"116521668-0-8747";"""Scouts: Turn in your report and collect your reward.\n\n- General Dar-Liurz"""
"116521668-0-8748";"It was inevitable. The only person he really loved was himself. It was only a matter of time before one of his ""true loves"" objected.\n\nI will miss him dearly, I did love him in spite of everything … but I could not change him. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8749";"He had so much to give the world—he gave joy to so many. He had many flaws, I'm no fool, but it is truly a waste.\n\nI must return to <<1>> to plan his funeral. Minstrels from across Tamriel are sure to attend. Thank you."
"116521668-0-8771";"Before we go, take this. Verandis gave it to me, but I can't keep it. You helped him so much. You should have it.\n\nYou helped the man I cared about … the man I loved. And you were with him to the end. This belongs to you."
"116521668-0-8786";"Excellent. I can't bear to think of the outcome had you not been here.\n\nBut no matter. Lady <<1>> and I will return to <<2>> as soon as it's safe."
"116521668-0-8794";"Much, when it is time. You have taught humility to a Daedric Prince, mortal. Tread carefully, for he will attempt to exact his revenge.\n\nNow go, with my blessing. When I have need of you, you will know."
"116521668-0-8795";"Yes, this is the right book. Just saw the witches using it a few minutes ago. I don't understand how this happened, but I sure do appreciate it.\n\nIf I get this book back to the Guildhall fast, they might not even notice it was gone!"
"116521668-0-8800";"I, for one, am as grateful to you as the flowers are to the sun. You brought life back to these lands when it was nearly choked out.\n\nThough we may never officially call an outsider a friend, I think we can at least consider you an ally."
"116521668-0-8804";"I suppose I might be able to. I would need a little blood. Stibbons, hold out your arm. This won't hurt a bit."
"116521668-0-8808";"No matter what the future holds, Evermore is deeply indebted to you, as I am too.\n\nIn times like these, we all need a hero like you … to remind us that no matter how bad things get, there's always hope."
"116521668-0-8819";"I know you will—I'm counting on it. Without you, this castle would already be flying Imperial banners. \n\nYou've saved the kingdom, and now its queen. If there's one person I believe in, it's you. Still, I don't know how we're going to do it alone."
"116521668-0-8830";"A modest sum, yes? And I will tell our associates of your daring plunder! Greedy Khajiit from all over Elsweyr will stumble over themselves contracting your services!"
"116521668-0-8836";"A letter? From my cousin? That's wonderful news! I'm glad to hear he made it to Stonefalls safely.\n\nThanks for bringing this to me, friend."
"116521668-0-8852";"No one else should suffer my folly. Thank you, and please take this for your troubles."
"116521668-0-8853";"How thoughtful! I can hardly turn down such a generous gift.\n\nEspecially with the trouble brewing in <<1>>."
"116521668-0-8856";"Now it is time for you to leave and for me to reap what I've sown. I was a successful jeweler in my day—take this for your troubles and go on with your life."
"116521668-0-8865";"Thank you. You've given me much peace. \n\nI think I'll to make it my personal crusade to repopulate the spriggans here. I'll find some in Glenumbra and Viridian Wood to bring back. So perhaps we will cross paths again."
"116521668-0-8866";"Thank you. I intend to take great care of this last little spriggan.\n\nWith Hircine's blessing, I hope she might be the seed to spawn many more, and that someday, a multitude of spriggans will again frolick in the waters of Jackdaw Cove."
"116521668-0-8867";"I had no doubts you'd triumph.\n\nThis may not be a stronghold, but there are people who need me. We'll fight back until the Imperials are beaten, or we die in glorious battle!"
"116521668-0-8868";"Yes, Evermore needs this alliance. But I need ….\n\nIsabeth's sacrifice will be remembered. You've proven yourself as a great ally to Evermore. I'll agree to this alliance. Together, we'll drive out the Reachmen."
"116521668-0-8869";"Yes. I think I judged the Baandari too soon. Silver-Paws is actually quite a gentleman … or is it a gentle-cat?\n\nI just hope he doesn't expect me to pay for this mead. No way. This one's on the house, and by ""the house,"" I mean ""the Baandari."""
"116521668-0-8882";"Thanks to you, we have an excellent start here in Shornhelm, and I will devote my resources to fortifying the city as quickly as possible.\n\nWe're secure here now and we have to ensure it remains that way."
"116521668-0-8884";"The Ayleid text referred to an outpost in the hills. I need to find out where that is. It may be that the answer to defeating Montclair can be found in this hidden location.\n\nBut first things first. There is a more urgent matter for you to deal with."
"116521668-0-8889";"Excellent! Thank you so much for recovering the cup from that terrible Nord ruffian.\n\nStibbons! Oh, Stibbons! Be a dear and drink from the Emerald Chalice. I want to see how its magic works before we return it to the Mages Guild."
"116521668-0-8893";"I'll return to Evermore to serve the crown. I am still a knight. It's my duty.\n\nFirst though, I will do what I came here to do. I will lay the prince to rest."
"116521668-0-8907";"Yes, for my duty is to protect innocents from predation. A spider's poison wears off, but research and collection by the untrained can never be healed.\n\nI see  <<1>> walks with you. You will share my wage for doing my job."
"116521668-0-8918";"Whether it's wise or not isn't for me to say. All I can say is that if Emeric wants to push on, I hope you will go with him.\n\nIt's clear that any undertaking you're a part of is more than likely to succeed."
"116521668-0-8923";"They will try, but without the Daedra or the link to Coldharbour, destroying the remaining Worm Cultists will be quick work.\n\nI will warn the Dominion of what they attempted with the Fangs of Chaos. It will not be allowed to happen again."
"116521668-0-8927";"I'll bury my friends. Then, I suppose I'll seek out more companions in the next vampire lair.\n\nI can't rest until this scourge is wiped from Tamriel. Zungarg and Agalir felt the same. Thank you for your help, friend."
"116521668-0-8937";"Oh, Puddles, what kind of trouble did you get yourself into? \n\nThank you so much for bringing my adorable Puddles home, friend. Here's a small reward. I know it's not much, but I want you to have it."
"116521668-0-8938";"I hoped your defeat of the Mad Architect would allow us to pass from this plane. Seems that was not the case.\n\nWe'll have to determine a new course of action—but we'll not trouble you with that. You have my thanks, friend. For everything."
"116521668-0-8940";"We must rebuild. The Imperials tore apart our fine city, but we will rise from the sands.\n\nYou have given us this chance. Forever will Hallin's Stand remember your work and your sacrifices!"
"116521668-0-8943";"Here, a little present.\n\nI can't make you a Vinedusk Ranger, but I can give you something to show you're an honorary member. They represent the king's trust, knowing we uphold the Green Pact despite our exemption from it. You've more than earned it."
"116521668-0-8944";"Here, a little present.\n\nI can't make you a Vinedusk Ranger, but I can give you something to show you're an honorary member. They represent the king's trust, knowing we uphold the Green Pact despite our exemption from it. You've more than earned it."
"116521668-0-8947";"A Dominion of peace. The fair and just rule of Tamriel, beneath an Aldmeri banner. A future I hope to build.\n\nAnd you, standing at my side. Come, help me build the future."
"116521668-0-8948";"I feared as much. Alas for Edweg's weakness and the evil deeds of the bandits.\n\nYour efforts are greatly appreciated. I have rewards for your bravery and skill in Arkay's cause."
"116521668-0-8953";"I watched as he died, alone and miserable. I envied him though, for I knew I would be trapped in the centurion. And for centuries I was, until you freed me.\n\nYou have my gratitude. I will rest now, join my family and perhaps, even, my long-lost love."
"116521668-0-8957";"I think I, er, we have accomplished quite a bit in this short time! \n\nWith Stibbons rescued, and our notes gathered, I think it's time we returned to civilization and compiled our conclusions. It will be a scholarly sensation!"
"116521668-0-8959";"Best news this one has heard all day. Rivenspire will sleep easier without that monster lurking in the shadows. Maybe we should change his name to No-Blades, yes? Get it?\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help. It's good to see Verandis was right about you."
"116521668-0-8960";"Oh yes, Adusa is fine. Nothing to worry about. Let's take a look at that list.\n\nOf course. Verandis. Adusa. And Gwendis. We're at the top of the list! That would certainly explain why they attacked the castle, yes?"
"116521668-0-8961";"Now? We fight back! These villains, they think they can strike at us where we live? They are fools and less than fools!\n\nWe will take the fight to them. Thanks to the information you have gathered, we know where the worm behind this hides."
"116521668-0-8962";"This threat, yes. But don't worry. Another will appear before you know it.\n\nYou have been a friend to Adusa. And to Rivenspire. Stay fragrant, Five-Claw. This one is sure we will meet again some day."
"116521668-0-8967";"Shor's bones, you did it! Thank you. With this, Marien will make a full recovery. I know it. I may even get up the nerve to ask for her hand. Heh!"
"116521668-0-8972";"I don't think so. I don't know. Maybe if I hadn't confronted him, he wouldn't have killed her….\n\nAt least the hostages are all right. You did your part, and you did it well."
"116521668-0-8994";"My Nathalye? Worried about me? Hah! I'll make sure to tell her about that when I get back. If you help me up, Xandier can lead me back home.\n\nDivines watch over you, traveler."
"116521668-0-9005";"Then it's decided. Thank you for your counsel. Both Queen Eselde and myself will be in your debt.\n\nAfter all you've done, there's no reward that can express my gratitude, but please accept this gift. I'd feel guilty if I didn't give you something."
"116521668-0-9006";"Then it's decided. Thank you for your counsel. Both King Alard and myself will be in your debt.\n\nAfter all you've done, there's no reward that can express my gratitude, but please accept this gift. I'd feel guilty if I didn't give you something."
"116521668-0-9012";"She did? That is funny, but I do not expect she will follow through.\n\nRegardless of her path though, I am grateful she will not interfere with mine, and for that, I have you to thank."
"116521668-0-9013";"With <<1>> appeased, we will continue to do what we do best. While I am sure Jode's Chariot will try to stop us, they will never blot us out entirely, no?\n\nThank you, my friend. We would not be here without your help."
"116521668-0-9014";"As long as the two of you weren't injured. That would have been tragic.\n\nWell, we'll all sleep a little better knowing that the dead have been laid to rest. Take this as a token of my appreciation."
"116521668-0-9015";"Consider it returned. The grotto belongs to the wyrd once again, but more importantly, to you.\n\nI'll be watching you, mortal. A larger hunt looms in your future, one I'll watch with great interest."
"116521668-0-9017";"Just give me a second, and I'll head back home. I knew <<1>> wouldn't leave me here to rot.\n\n<<2>> will be worried sick. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-9036";"I think so. All in one piece, anyway. If it weren't for you, I'd be spider meat. Thanks again."
"116521668-0-9040";"We'll interrogate <<1>> until we know the extent of her treason. Then she'll die, as all traitors must.\n\nBut no matter. Your efficiency in resolving this matter was commendable, and the Dominion rewards its servants."
"116521668-0-9041";"That's my sister's journal. So sweet but so young and foolish. She was obsessed with the idea that trolls could be socialized.\n\nI knew this day would eventually come. I think it's time for another cup of mead. Thanks."
"116521668-0-9042";"That's a strange way to put it, but Adusa will not pry. I'm disappointed we can't interrogate the informer, but the threat has been taken care of.\n\nThank you."
"116521668-0-9043";"I wish there was something I could give you by way of gratitude. But I'm an Elf of little means, and this pittance is all I have. It will have to be enough. Thank you."
"116521668-0-9051";"<<1>> remains true to its name, then. I'm sorry to hear it. <<2>> might have been a dunderheaded double-crosser, but he was still my friend.\n\nI figure I owe you what the treethane paid me for the bow. Some thief I turned out to be, eh?"
"116521668-0-9053";"Not much. You've done extraordinary work. And just in time for <<1>>'s arrival!"
"116521668-0-9060";"I'm not sure. There are so many memories here, but we can't keep the farm in good order with just the two of us.\n\nMayla and I might travel for awhile. Visit Shornhelm. Or Wayrest. We'll make a new life for ourselves, thanks to you."
"116521668-0-9064";"<<1>>'s dead? Sad news, even if he did steal this bow from me.\n\nIt's a good thing you found it. I sort of owed it to a local treethane. Long story. I hope you'll accept this for a reward."
"116521668-0-9066";"Were you indeed?\n\n<<1>> sent you from <<2>>, did she? A bit dramatic of her, but she does have an eye for talented people. Perhaps you could put your talents to use."
"116521668-0-9070";"Ah, thrilling. I can just imagine the heroics. I'm sorry—most of the pleasures of old age are vicarious. \n\nAt least I still have my research, which you've helped immensely, I must add. Thank you."
"116521668-0-9074";"I need time to deal with this. I can't believe I'll never see Nedras again.\n\nThank … thank you for telling me the truth about him. Green keep you, stranger."
"116521668-0-9075";"When I find Nedras, he's going to have some explaining to do!\n\nThank you for telling me. If you'll excuse me, I need to start planning how to track down my good-for-nothing brother!"
"116521668-0-9076";"May Jone, Jode, and Yenadar watch you on the road, traveler. Kala's brother will be guiding your steps. She can feel it."
"116521668-0-9077";"Good luck on the road, traveler. And if you find Kala's brother before she does, tell him he will need the blessings of Jone and Jode both to avoid my claws. Bah!"
"116521668-0-9078";"That's it, I've decided. Men are all mules. I'm going to march right over to the Dead Wolf, get ripping drunk. Maybe tomorrow I'll join the city guard. Bah!\n\nThanks for telling me, I guess. If you'll excuse me?"
"116521668-0-9079";"No, no. You know what? Don't apologize. This is just what I needed to hear. I'll go straight away to talk to Lorbash at the smithy. This is a new chapter for me!\n\nThank you for setting me straight, stranger."
"116521668-0-9080";"His lordship, the Baron over there, wants us to head inside, see what's going on, and secure the area. He wants us to be slow and careful so as not to damage his precious city.\n\nGood job getting that key, by the way. Now let's go save Northpoint."
"116521668-0-9081";"Something that no mortal has ever seen, until that nasty woman went in there, of course … and who knows what she might have done to the place …?\n\nI guess you'll be finding out soon enough though."
"116521668-0-9085";"Once a pup, now a wolf. Once prey, now a hunter. The blood of the true hunter, and the pack, is now yours. They are your only family, your only allegiance.\n\nHunt well."
"116521668-0-9086";"You are free of Hircine's corruption. You were brave to face and kill his horrific beasts. Should you become infected again, you need only return to me and receive my blessing."
"116521668-0-9092";"Excellent. To be honest, I wasn't sure you would return at all. \n\nThis is a favorable turn. Now we can secure this area and ensure it is not a weak link in our defense of the region. You have my gratitude."
"116521668-0-9093";"Relish this new life I have given you. Feed and grow powerful.\n\nFind others of our kind. Form families. Bring new children into the fold!"
"116521668-0-9094";"We'll proceed as planned. These ruins are too interesting to leave, despite our unhappy first impression.\n\nYou there, take this pittance as a reward. I need to have a word with my guide."
"116521668-0-9096";"A gruesome trophy, to be sure, but we've thought him dead twice before, only to learn how painfully wrong we were.\n\nThere are many grieving families who will rejoice to hear of Sgolag's death. Here's your reward. It's well-earned."
"116521668-0-9101";"You can't know what this means to me. This was my life's work. Everything I've learned in twenty years of studying kwama.\n\nI thought I was going to have to give up, find something new. Thank you so much."
"116521668-0-9103";"Yes, of course. To Oblivion with this whole campaign folly, and the Seventh Legion. \n\nAs you can see, my men are securing their gear and preparing for the march back to Cyrodiil. It's a long journey, but it'll be good to fight where we're needed."
"116521668-0-9106";"I hope that she is. Perhaps killing me will grant her some solace. She deserves justice. \n\nI deserve to die."
"116521668-0-9107";"Yes, of course. I'm sorry … for everything. Gods, what have I done …."
"116521668-0-9108";"Don't you recognize the old beggar without his rags? I've been following you for quite a while! Even my own followers suspected nothing.\n\nDhakir and Qismah will never forget what you've done for them."
"116521668-0-9109";"She is in no shape to fight. I can't imagine what tortures she must have endured under the Imperials' reign.\n\nYou are our symbol, friend. Our symbol of freedom."
"116521668-0-9112";"You bet your arse there is. Queen Maraya's messenger said she had heard rumors, and I guess they were true … or something.\n\nGo talk to Captain Marck. He actually walked a little ways down the dock. Better he tells you about it himself."
"116521668-0-9114";"Then accept the gift of Eidetic Memory. Remember now every tome, every book, every scrap of paper you have ever read.\n\nAnd remember, too, the tale of Eyevea's return to Tamriel, and the story of the Adept who made it happen."
"116521668-0-9125";"Shrouded Pass? That means Montclair is in the Doomcrag! Then the time has come to strike down the traitor and restore peace to our shores!\n\nBut first, I want to thank you for helping the people of Northpoint. I won't forget your bravery."
"116521668-0-9136";"It is <<1>>'s duty to send those who measure up to our standards. She doesn't take her task lightly."
"116521668-0-9139";"Oh, I see. My apologies then. She had been after me to aid her, but I saw it as her usual nagging. Maybe she really does need someone. I should go and see her. You have my thanks for the kindness you showed her. I'll tell her you kept your word."
"116521668-0-9143";"We'll perform our hearts out! The Wood Elves will see there's more to the Summerset Isles than stuffy politicians.\n\nReturn anytime you wish. If there's enough call for it, we may have new performances to share!"
"116521668-0-9144";"I suppose so. Furthermore, I'm grateful now that Septima never returned my affections. Mara's mercy, that woman did not age well!\n\nShe's irrelevant now though, thanks to you. I suspect, however, that we can't afford to rest on our laurels just yet."
"116521668-0-9147";"Edouard Celd? Really? It's always the ones you least suspect. We'll learn much from Edouard, though he may not be a willing teacher.\n\nThank you for your help."
"116521668-0-9158";"Enough? This is more than I even dreamed of. I think this might even allow me to piece together the complete tablet! Variations in the runes, slightly altered structure … yes, yes, this is very exciting!"
"116521668-0-9162";"Hmph. Don't care to keep company with your old granny Alyxe? Or is it the smell of the boiling kwama? A little too heady for your delicate sensibilities?\n\nOh, well. I'll enjoy it all for myself. I always do!"
"116521668-0-9164";"Without Naruk, the Children of Yokuda will crumble. No one can say King Fahara'jad did not deal them justice. The Daggerfall Covenant is safe, and so am I, thanks to you.\n\nNow have a drink with us and celebrate our victory."
"116521668-0-9167";"Yes. The blood-curse is gone from you.\n\nTerrible dangers, such as werewolves and vampires, crawl in the darkness. Should you fall victim to their infection, know I will lift the evil with the light of Arkay."
"116521668-0-9173";"Hurry along then. You will find the king just up the road.  \n\nI am going to scale this wall and try to get more details on the Imperials' defenses. I will join you shortly."
"116521668-0-9174";"You've found the notes! Oh, superb. I'm sure I can cobble these together and keep the high points on the voyage.\n\nI might even make the two of them my co-authors—no, no that's absurd! Here, a pittance for your trouble."
"116521668-0-9178";"How exciting! We still have much to learn about the Ayleids that settled here. I am most glad you sought me out with this."
"116521668-0-9179";"No gold, no relics, just a silly old blade! I'm sorry, but I was counting on something of value! I can't pay you much now.\n\nI don't shave though, so I guess I'll sell the blade. Maybe I can get something for it."
"116521668-0-9180";"Saifa apologizes. The moons do not always show her things in a timely manner. You have already walked the path the moons have shown me.\n\nKnow always that Jone and Jode light the path for the faithful."
"116521668-0-9181";"All right. All right. I don't need to hear any more. I'm not going to pretend I understand any of this, and I don't really want to.\n\nHere's your half of the payment. I'll make sure the mage gets safely to his destination."
"116521668-0-9183";"Reaper's March? You're pulling this one's hind leg! Did she say where in—no, wait, of course she didn't.\n\nWell, this one thanks you anyway. To expect a better result would be folly."
"116521668-0-9187";"The loss of my husband's other wives is a recent tragedy. It does our village no good to drag their names through the mud.\n\nPlease, tell no one what you found. I'll inform my husband eventually, when he's ready."
"116521668-0-9191";"Yes, once his suffering was greater than his need to see his revenge made manifest. Keep the trophy, if you wish. \n\nThe idea that waving a stolen hat would somehow restore the Old Tower to us was nothing but a dying Orc's folly."
"116521668-0-9196";"Not terribly long, but long enough that he has formulated a plan of attack.\n\nThis plan requires someone to take quite a bit of risk. I tried to volunteer for the duty, but he insists that you be the one, so I wish you good luck, my friend."
"116521668-0-9197";"You did? I mean, good! Good. Well, now. Hopefully we can pack up and move out before another Imperial patrol finds us.\n\nYes. Thank you for your help. Thanks."
"116521668-0-9204";"Gods! She's still trying to control me! That's why I left! I'm not taking orders from Cousin Freyda anymore, and I'll be staying in Evermore whether she likes it or not.\n\nThanks for the message. Thanks for reminding me why I'm here."
"116521668-0-9206";"<He appears to have been killed by numerous small wounds caused by either very precise weapons or a giant flock of birds.>"
"116521668-0-9212";"There is very little I can do unfortunately. We barely have enough men to secure the city even with Uela's defeat. They will just have to make do with what they have."
"116521668-0-9213";"The ancient temple? What business would the Imperials have there?\n\nIf we had knights to spare, we could send them, but right now, any soldiers will have to come from Evermore. I'll see to it. Thank you for the message."
"116521668-0-9221";"And we're done! You are now one of the Undaunted. Divines help you."
"116521668-0-9234";"The path ahead of us is a dark one, but it pleases me to know that I shall walk that path with friends. \n\nMay we all rest a little easier tonight. I know I shall."
"116521668-0-9235";"So it has, so it has! Are you feeling enlightened? Lighter? Lit?\n\nWhy you would want to keep mucking around in Tamriel is quite beyond me. Nasty place. How—how do you get the smell out of your clothing?"
"116521668-0-9241";"Not the whole world! It's rather larger than it looks. But, you've seen quite a lot of it, to be sure!\n\nWell done. Well done, indeed. Now, I've a little something for you. Hardly suitable recompense for all your efforts, but there you are."
"116521668-0-9243";"Yes. Sounds like an Undaunted to me. Welcome to the group!\n\nWhat? Were you expecting a big ceremony, full of pomp and confetti? We do things a bit different here."
"116521668-0-9256";"So it has, so it has! Are you feeling enlightened? Lighter? Lit?\n\nWhy you would want to keep mucking around in Tamriel is quite beyond me. Nasty place. How—how do you get the smell out of your clothing?"
"116521668-0-9257";"So it has, so it has! Are you feeling enlightened? Lighter? Lit?\n\nWhy you would want to keep mucking around in Tamriel is quite beyond me. Nasty place. How—how do you get the smell out of your clothing?"
"116521668-0-9258";"Not the whole world! Never the whole world.\n\nBut, quite a bit, yes. Now I've got something for you, for all your trouble."
"116521668-0-9259";"Not the whole world! Never the whole world.\n\nBut, quite a bit, yes. Now I've got something for you, for all your trouble."
"116521668-0-9268";"Yes, I think our work here is done. Now we must turn our attention to Baron Montclair. That traitor needs to be dealt with.\n\nBut before we go, know that I appreciate all that you have done. My sister died in the Light, thanks to you."
"116521668-0-9269";"Ha! Easier said than done, I'm afraid. But I'm glad to hear Emeric gives a damn. We thought maybe our dispatches weren't getting through.\n\nI was about to walk to Wayrest myself, but you saved me that trouble. And I suspect you can help me further."
"116521668-0-9272";"Ah, you truly are deserving of my gift. The grotto belongs to the wyrd once again, but more importantly, to you.\n\nI'll be watching you, mortal. A larger hunt looms in your future, one I'll watch with great interest."
"116521668-0-9274";"My plan worked! I sent the caravan containing <<1>>'s wine down a road frequented by the bandits, in the hope that they would steal it and fall under its curse. Thank you for clearing them out."
"116521668-0-9276";"I'm as in charge of this madhouse as anyone, but I have no time for diplomats."
"116521668-0-9277";"I sent the caravan with <<1>>'s wine down a road frequented by the bandits, in the hope that they would steal it and fall under its curse. I'm sorry you got caught in the trap as well."
"116521668-0-9278";"Then all of Ivarstead owes you thanks. He could've been the end of this village if left to his own devices. Here, it's not much, but take this as a token of my appreciation."
"116521668-0-9279";"Yes, I remember you! A familiar face is a welcome one in dire times.\n\nYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me."
"116521668-0-9280";"Yes, I remember you! A familiar face is a welcome one in dire times.\n\nYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me."
"116521668-0-9281";"<You find <<1>>'s reward nestled underneath the first layer of stones.>"
"116521668-0-9283";"They put out the lighthouse signal fire so ships would crash on the rocks!\n\nDamn it! That could've been much worse, I'm sure. I'm glad you were able to stop them. Thank you for letting us know."
"116521668-0-9284";"After I return it to the Orrery? Perhaps I can research its properties once the ceremony is complete.\n\nIf the queen allows, of course. I'm not one to stand in the way of royalty."
"116521668-0-9285";"Found you toiling about in the forest, did she? Welcome to our little party. We could definitely use some help."
"116521668-0-9286";"Thanks to you. Don't worry, friend. Next time we'll be a lot more careful. Never would've expected Daedra-worshipers in a bandit lair.\n\nThanks. We owe you."
"116521668-0-9288";"If only we'd known, we could have hired you instead of them. I'm sure they mean well, but I've never seen such incompetence before!\n\nWe do not have much, but please take this as a token of our gratitude."
"116521668-0-9297";"There aren't many that would've helped us out. I'm grateful. Grateful enough to share some of our payment. As a thank you for all your help."
"116521668-0-9302";"Dominion correspondence? Let me see ….\n\nHa! The guard's failure to protect our citizens is already the gossip of Stormhold. Why not Elven spies? Dark times, no doubt about it."
"116521668-0-9303";"You've earned my esteem, my friend, and that's no small thing. You're a friend to the Ring of Daggers now.\n\nI have a feeling we'll cross paths again someday. May the gods watch over you until then."
"116521668-0-9305";"Betrayed? Then our worst fears are realized. All the more reason to renew our assault on <<1>>!"
"116521668-0-9308";"Thank you. Thank you so much. I promise you, whatever efforts I made to redeem myself before, they will be doubled.\n\nEvery hour, for the rest of my life, I will try to earn the reprieve you've given me."
"116521668-0-9310";"<<1>>? Long has it been since he crawled from the pool.\n\nSithis looks upon us with a hungry eye, but we yet draw breath. The time for stillness has not come."
"116521668-0-9313";"Thank you. I suppose it will do little to console young Rubyn, but at least we can give Lady Mondorie a proper funeral.\n\nI got my job back. The mayor's even increased my wages. You have my gratitude. By Mauloch, you have the whole town's gratitude."
"116521668-0-9318";"You did? Excellent! I don't know what you said to him but I don't care. It's my duty to get new recruits and you helped me fulfill it. Thank you.\n\nI'll have the deputy release him and we'll get him whipped into shape in no time."
"116521668-0-9319";"You did? Excellent! I don't know what you said to him but I don't care. It's my duty to get new recruits and you helped me fulfill it. Thank you.\n\nI'll have the deputy release him and we'll get him whipped into shape in no time."
"116521668-0-9320";"You did? Excellent! I don't know what you said to him but I don't care. It's my duty to get new recruits and you helped me fulfill it. Thank you.\n\nI'll have the deputy release him and we'll get him whipped into shape in no time."
"116521668-0-9321";"You did? Excellent! I don't know what you said to him but I don't care. It's my duty to get new recruits and you helped me fulfill it. Thank you.\n\nI'll have the deputy release him and we'll get him whipped into shape in no time."
"116521668-0-9326";"You did? Well, I'll be an Argonian's aunt! I really didn't think you could pull that off.\n\nYou missed your calling, my friend. You should have been a recruiter. You can't seem to fail."
"116521668-0-9340";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9342";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9343";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9344";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9349";"A battle won, but the war rages on. We must reach the Lightless Remnant and destroy it. But Montclair will grow more desperate the closer we get to that cursed relic.\n\nAre you ready, my friend? Once more into the breach?"
"116521668-0-9352";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9353";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9354";"None that are worth our time, and I'll have my hands full whipping these three into shape anyhow.\n\nThe general's jaw's going to hit the dirt when I march them in. I'll tell him I had help, of course. I don't want him assigning me this duty again."
"116521668-0-9355";"Restored the Apex Stone? Incredible! Then my predictions were more accurate than I expected and you've done more than I could have asked. \n\nI'll keep the amulet safe here among the Star-Gazers for now. There may be more we can learn from it."
"116521668-0-9363";"Only to say that, without you, none of this would have been possible. My father, my mother, <<1>>, maybe even Federic … we would all be dead, right now.\n\nIf you ever have need of a home … please. You will be welcome here."
"116521668-0-9369";"Only to say that, without you, none of this would have been possible. My father, my mother, <<1>>, maybe even Federic … we would all be dead, right now.\n\nIf you ever have need of a home … please. You will be welcome here."
"116521668-0-9370";"Only to say that, without you, none of this would have been possible. My father, my mother, <<1>>, maybe even Federic … we would all be dead, right now.\n\nIf you ever have need of a home … please. You will be welcome here."
"116521668-0-9371";"Only to say that, without you, none of this would have been possible. My father, my mother, <<1>>, maybe even Federic … we would all be dead, right now.\n\nIf you ever have need of a home … please. You will be welcome here."
"116521668-0-9387";"I can't believe I'll never see Nedras again … but he was so kind to me.\n\nAnd you! Thank you for telling me about my brother, and bringing me his gift. I'll never forget you."
"116521668-0-9397";"As the bones foretold! I knew someone would come to help us. The boar's tusk lies beneath the fox's leg. That means death, from one who walks far.\n\nNo matter where you wander, you'll find friends in Shor's Stone, for so long as we live."
"116521668-0-9399";"Gather allies before you leave the city. You'll need loyal friends to face the armies of the Warrior, the Mage, and the Serpent.\n\nReturn to me each time you learn something new. I will use what you learn to devise a plan to defeat the Celestials."
"116521668-0-9401";"Ah. Good. Then at least Holgunn knows there's a problem here. I will return and give him a full report as soon as I can.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're willing to help us against the Worm Cult here, talk to Netapatuu."
"116521668-0-9402";"I told him I could handle this, but Taarengrav is overrun with cultists. Perhaps with your help, we might have a chance to turn the tide."
"116521668-0-9403";"Then welcome to the battle, friend!\n\nWe must strike back against these bastards now, before we lose our chance."
"116521668-0-9410";"Yes! Thank you, traveler. This means I'll get to keep my head. \n\nI think I've regained strength enough to make it back to Kragenmoor. I'll spare you the wrath of my captain and report the news myself. Three keep you!"
"116521668-0-9411";"Those crafty bastards. Use the beastmen's own bugs to drive them out of the caves. Then the beasties raise havoc with the civilians. Crafted milk-drinking sots, they are.\n\nGood work. I'll be sure the General sees this."
"116521668-0-9414";"By the hoary hosts of Auri-El, thank you. If I'd arrived in Kragenmoor empty-handed, I don't think it would have gone well for me.\n\nGo with the thanks of this humble trader, and his masters in the Darkvale Trading Coster."
"116521668-0-9415";"The what with the … wards? All right, whatever you say traveler. I'll pass your word to one of our scouts. They'll find Walks-in-Ash and make sure she gets the message. Thanks for your service."
"116521668-0-9417";"Truer words were never spoken."
"116521668-0-9418";"A smart woman. Seems I'll never be free of my debt to her. Hah!"
"116521668-0-9420";"The Covenant has landed in force, that's what's the word. The leadership of our forces, and theirs, have gone mad. The Dark Elves love these land coral growths, I know, but … what are we doing here?"
"116521668-0-9421";"Ah, excellent! Welcome to Ash Mountain! Mind the lava, now. Hah!"
"116521668-0-9423";"Thank you for this. That's it, then. Stonefalls holds nothing for me now. I'll set out for Deshaan presently. Perhaps I'll see you down the road."
"116521668-0-9424";"These don't look like my shoes. Mine had tassles here and a tear there. And more buckles. My shoes definitely have more buckles.\n\nBut thank you for finding my wife's mace. I wish I could have been there with you when you took down that Hagraven."
"116521668-0-9435";"Gore and Glory! It's about damn time. Let me see ….\n\nOh. It says we're to stay here until further notice. That pretty much stinks like three-day old troll dung. Thanks for the message though. Yeah."
"116521668-0-9442";"Then we are once again in your debt, champion.\n\nHere. Take this. As a token of our deep appreciation. Now Northpoint can rest easy. At least as far as this threat is concerned."
"116521668-0-9444";"Of course. I would be happy to accept the offering. \n\nStrange as it may sound for someone to make an offering to a Daedric Prince, there are actually many who do so, hoping for Azura's blessing. I believe she obliges them when she can."
"116521668-0-9448";"Damn. Another one. We can't afford to keep losing soldiers like this!"
"116521668-0-9470";"Something about Her Majesty's speech, eh? That's what I'd guess. I'll make sure it gets into the right hands. \n\nThe Watch thanks you for your service."
"116521668-0-9477";"That's the same conclusion I reached, but at least the Serk is safe. For now.\n\nHere. Take this. For helping me find my brother and expose the true nature of the Maulborn."
"116521668-0-9480";"Another one, eh? Well, you're not the first and won't be the last.\n\nLet me be the first to welcome you to Vulkhel Guard!"
"116521668-0-9483";"I should have expected such initiative from the queen's chosen. Tracking down Vicereeve Pelidil will take time. That is my responsibility as the Staff of Magnus disappeared on my watch.\n\nI will keep the queen apprised of our actions."
"116521668-0-9501";"I have to admit. I do have some doubts now, but we'll petition the Wilderking for an audience.\n\nWhen he hears of our plight, I know he'll confirm that we can settle here. He'll make sure the wood is protected too."
"116521668-0-9503";"We have no purpose, so we will return to our vigil. Our directives render us dormant until circumstances again warrant action.\n\nI have no sentiment, but I do have memories, and I will remember you and what you have done here to protect the Valenwood."
"116521668-0-9515";"That's what I'm thinking as well. But maybe your efforts were enough to put an end to all that.\n\nFor now, at least, the Serk is safe. Take this as a thank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-9517";"I've been watching the townsfolk who received the curative and came to the same conclusion. But I'll be able to tell for sure after I analyze the elixir.\n\nTake this. It isn't much, but I'm sure you didn't have too much trouble in there."
"116521668-0-9522";"I know. His fate is in the Three's hands now, but he certainly has a fighting chance—thanks to you.\n\nHere, take this. There's no way I can truly repay you for what you've done for the Serk, but it's a start."
"116521668-0-9527";"See that Titus makes it to Belkarth. The Star-Gazers will give him refuge. I feel he may still have a part to play in our struggle.\n\nContinue to work with Hara of the Star-Gazers. I will reach out to you again when it is safe to do so."
"116521668-0-9537";"This was written by Ibrula! We've been looking for her for weeks. Is she okay?\n\nOh my … this is awful. What did she find in that house? I will inform Hara. She will be interested to know about this."
"116521668-0-9549";"Excellent! You are now a Student of the Mages Guild! Every book you find will now earn you reputation in the guild.\n\nI suggest you begin by talking to Valaste, our Mistress of Incunabula. She often has tasks for new recruits. Good luck!"
"116521668-0-9550";"To me? You mean like fetching water and cleaning my fruit? Oh, that is really sweet, but it would be selfish of me to accept. \n\nThere are others who are in much greater need. Like that Khajiit Hazazi. He seriously needs help. I can manage on my own."
"116521668-0-9551";"Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as an Associate of the Fighters Guild! Get out there and take the fight to the Daedra!\n\nYou're in luck, comrade. Sees-All-Colors herself is here today. Why don't you go introduce yourself?"
"116521668-0-9552";"Excellent! Welcome to the Mages Guild! I suggest you begin by talking to Valaste, our Mistress of Incunabula. \n\nShe's in the stacks on the floor below, and often has tasks for new recruits. Good luck!"
"116521668-0-9555";"Then welcome to the family, as an Associate of the Fighters Guild. Get out there and take the fight to the Daedra!\n\nSees-All-Colors herself often has tasks for new recruits. Why don't you introduce yourself?"
"116521668-0-9558";"Excellent! Allow me to welcome you as a Student of the Guild! \n\nI suggest you begin by talking to Valaste, our Mistress of Incunabula. She's at the back of the hall, and often has tasks for new recruits. Good luck!"
"116521668-0-9559";"Then let me welcome you as an Associate of the Fighters Guild! Get out there and take the fight to the Daedra!\n\nYou're in luck, too. Sees-All-Colors herself is here, upstairs. She often has tasks for new recruits. Why don't you introduce yourself?"
"116521668-0-9593";"I will continue my quest to find relics for my master and acquire the knowledge to defeat the Celestials.\n\nYou might do the same. If you find curious relics from Craglorn's lost history, bring them here and Hermaeus Mora will reward you."
"116521668-0-9600";"It's funny. The flowers meant so much to us when we were young, but at the end, we didn't need the flowers any more. We had the memories.\n\nThese seeds are wonderful though. I realize now their true significance."
"116521668-0-9608";"What mad sorcery. Better that she's gone and the water cleansed.\n\nThank you for this. Maybe this will give us a chance to do proper research and find out what really happened to this city."
"116521668-0-9628";"At last. Although it does not end the suffering of my fellow Sword-Disciples, at least the Serpent's foul poison will spread no more.\n\nFor my part, I will wait here until it is safe to enter, bury the dead, and see if I can carry on their legacy."
"116521668-0-9635";"I never had a chance. They drugged us. Then the Hagraven came. Its breath on my face! It sucked out my eyes. I'll never see again."
"116521668-0-9638";"By Shor's prickly hairs—I wanted to be the first to tell the tale of the Citadel.\n\nYou've beat us, my friend. You've daunted the Undaunted."
"116521668-0-9639";"I'd ask you what you saw there, but that would ruin the surprise.\n\nMy allies and I will be the first to slay whatever lurks in the Citadel. Soon as they get here."
"116521668-0-9657";"Talk to the Vinedusk. Bodring is in command here. He'll know best what needs to be done.\n\nMay the gods be with you, friend. May the gods be with us all."
"116521668-0-9659";"You're leaving? And without a proper send off? We don't even have a bottle of wine!\n\nBut in all sincerity, thanks for helping us. You really are an inspiration. And I should know, seeing as I'm pretty inspirational myself."
"116521668-0-9675";"Then accept the penance of Eidetic Memory. Remember now every tome, every book, every scrap of paper you have ever read.\n\nAnd remember, too, the tale of Eyevea's return to Tamriel, and your role in that tale."
"116521668-0-9690";"A priestess of the … what? We were attacked here! A dark creature, I think it was a Khajiit! The Mane attacked us!"
"116521668-0-9691";"Narsis? Damn! I have family in Narsis.\n\nWell, keep an eye out for anymore of those Maulborn fetchers. There's bound to be more of them skulking about the countryside."
"116521668-0-9694";"This one knows, Hallowed. Your bravery fills us all with pride. \n\nPreparations have already begun. Your path to the Two Moons Dance begins here, and now."
"116521668-0-9695";"A priestess of the … what? We were attacked here! A dark creature, I think it was a Khajiit! The Mane attacked us!"
"116521668-0-9702";"Indeed. It's for the best. The pits are unnecessary now that Rahni'Za is no more."
"116521668-0-9703";"You've done well thus far, but I warn you, the betrayer is wicked and he will not hesitate to employ devious tricks to trap and defeat you.\n\nHe brought the greatest Sword-Disciples of the age to their knees. He will not easily be stopped."
"116521668-0-9705";"You are nearly there. But the final trial is the hardest. You will need to pay close attention to your environment and beware Abelazar's tricks."
"116521668-0-9707";"You have bested Abelazar and conquered the trials of Rahni'Za.\n\nYou are a true Sword-Disciple. May your name ever be remembered."
"116521668-0-9713";"Well, you look like you think you've won a war. What did you best up there? One of the Divines? Ha! I slay me.\n\nI hope there's something left for me to kill up there. Brulo—still nowhere to be found!"
"116521668-0-9719";"So you saw everything there was to see, eh?\n\nWhat do these mages keep up there? Giant rats from their experiments? Ha! I'm joking—don't tell me. I'll see for myself, soon enough."
"116521668-0-9720";"Oh. About that. I may have exaggerated my position here at the forge.\n\nBut don't worry. I'll find a way to get my sister what she needs for the family business. In the meantime, take this. For your trouble."
"116521668-0-9723";"Oh, I don't have the answers. I just know we need you. Go on into the camp. Talk to Holgunn One-Eye, or better yet, talk to King Jorunn himself. Find out what they're planning.\n\nAll I can say is I'm glad you're here. They need you."
"116521668-0-9724";"I know. But still, it's so terrible. Whatever the source of this curse, you must find a way to end it.\n\nI will take Nahlia back to the main camp. Thank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-9727";"Fire! Of course. The beast couldn't stand against its purifying flame.\n\nIn happened in the past, just as you defeated him in Camlorn. If something like him appears in the future, we'll be ready—thanks to you!"
"116521668-0-9728";"I thought as much. That's how you defeated him in Camlorn, and it matches the story my family passed down. \n\nYou really are a hero, aren't you? Maybe more than we know."
"116521668-0-9729";"That's good. It was hard losing Camlorn, but I heard what you did there. Impressive work.\n\nMeanwhile, we've made significant progress here. Our research is finally beginning to yield results."
"116521668-0-9730";"Oh yes, my friend. Like the corrupted vines he so loved to plant, Angof's villainy reaches into the farthest corners of my kingdom. I order you to pluck out these lingering threats in my name.\n\nI shall never forget your service this day, however."
"116521668-0-9731";"I suspect it will be a long time before the people of Elinhir trust mages again—and with good reason. The city is in ruins and it's our fault.\n\nI'll seal off the mage towers and help rebuild the city. If they'll let me, that is."
"116521668-0-9733";"I hope not, but we can never be too cautious. \n\nIn the meantime, I will take samples of the staff to the Mages Guild for study."
"116521668-0-9736";"I find this offering to be acceptable. Inside the gem, you can see the celestial bodies in their courses.\n\nThe text says the constellations are gods. They can be brought to earth using stones carved from Aetherium. Make of that what you will."
"116521668-0-9737";"The Dwemer knew things you cannot even dream.\n\nHere is your reward: the Celestials are bound to this realm by their Apex stones. These stones were constructed using knowledge stolen from the Dwemer. To defeat the Celestials, you must find the stones."
"116521668-0-9738";"A death, and an unrequited love. Sentimental, and unimportant. \n\nBut you have fulfilled your part of the bargain, so here is mine: there is a man who can help you defeat the Anka-Ra. His name is Titus Valerius, but he is not of this time."
"116521668-0-9746";"We've sent the Serpent reeling, but he will strike again.\n\nWe need to use this time to prepare our forces and free the Mage and the Warrior. The Serpent can only be defeated through the combined efforts of all three guardians."
"116521668-0-9750";"Listen. I know I've been a spineless lout, but I'm grateful for this. When we summoned those atronachs, we never imagined they'd be turned against Craglorn.\n\nIf I can ever repay the favor, let me know."
"116521668-0-9752";"""Speculations on a Cure for the Dreadful Corruption, Imposed by Shada on the City of Water, on the Eve of the Invasion of Tarish-Zi""?\n\nThis is Nedic! How did you? No, I don't care. This may be just what we need to help the afflicted. Many thanks!"
"116521668-0-9769";"I thank you, my friend. From the bottom of my soul, I thank you. I don't care where we go, or what we do. What you've given back to me is priceless."
"116521668-0-9780";"Wait … they were telling the truth? I guess it makes sense. They did all look and talk the same.\n\nI must inform the Star-Gazers of this development. The tides may finally be turning in our favor!"
"116521668-0-9801";"You live to fight another day! Treasure it! I have much work to do. Someone's going to have to look after this prison for Lord Bal.\n\nThis trinket is for you. I've infused it with the animus of the great Lord Warden. Take it and go."
"116521668-0-9825";"You are not needed here. Not yet. In the meantime, I see that you must go to … the Grim Watch. Speak to Thalinfar to learn more about this course."
"116521668-0-9847";"You've outdone us, friend. You've reached the heart of this Citadel before the Undaunted.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, but we'd like to give you something special to commemorate your feat!"
"116521668-0-9848";"You've outdone us, friend. You've explored the Aetherian Archive before the Undaunted.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, but we'd like to give you something special to commemorate your feat!"
"116521668-0-9854";"And you look perfectly healthy. How … irksome. I suppose my wayward acolytes weren't as powerful as I thought. I'll need to be more diligent in my training of their replacements.\n\nStill, my lord Satakal thanks you. May his coils guide your steps."
"116521668-0-9883";"The battle against the Scaled Court will continue, but this was the one place in Craglorn the Serpent could be contained. You accomplished wonders today.\n\nTuruk wanted me to give this to you. Don't worry—it's not diseased. I think."
"116521668-0-9885";"Fed them to … but why would …. Those scaleless savages! I swear on the Hist, we'll sun ourselves with vengeance before we depart!\n\nThank you for trying to save them. And for bringing us their badges. Their families will appreciate the gesture."
"116521668-0-9887";"The little goat honors the stones with Agganor's blood! I will see the Scaled Court destroyed as well, this Lashburr swears.\n\nLittle goat, it has my thanks. Steel for its enemies, blood for its tribe."
"116521668-0-9899";"You are five-clawed, my friend. Milksop no longer, though it will not stop this one from naming you ""Milksop.""\n\nIt seems none among the captured live. A shame, but Turuk will think of them when he sheathes his sword with the belly of a beast."
"116521668-0-9908";"Well. I suppose we could wait for reinforcements. Mordra and Kailstig are out there. Somewhere. Or we could call the Fighter's Guild.\n\nThis is embarassing."
"116521668-0-9917";"I had hoped until the end that Nerien'eth could be redeemed. He never gave us the chance. I suppose I have to decide what to do with this blade. Try to move on. Whatever that means at this point.\n\nThank you again—you proved invaluable today."
"116521668-0-9923";"Exarch Arnoth? I've heard his name whispered in fear, even among the Scaled Court. If you killed him, you've dealt a far greater blow to the Serpent's cult than you can imagine. \n\nPerhaps now we'll be able to learn more about the nirncrux element."
"116521668-0-9956";"Thank you for helping me in this matter.\n\nNow, I need to make sure these spawning pools can't be used again. And I should collect a few of the mantikora remains. I need to study them so I can continue to oppose the Serpent's horrid plans."
"116521668-0-9973";"Right. Of course. \n\nCassi asked me to bring some of the altered nirncrux to her. So she can study it. I'll stay here and collect what I need. But thanks. I couldn't have completed my mission without you!"

"116521668-0-10050";"And so we did. Cassipia and Little Leaf's deaths were regrettable, but they were a necessary evil in our efforts to save Craglorn.\n\nYou have provided another great service to the Guardian Celestials. For that, you have my gratitude."

"116521668-0-10129";"Teaching the Daedra the concept of fear is always worth a fair share! Take your key and your cut, then shake the dirt and blood off and share the story of your victory!\n\nIt'll be hard to out do a trip to Oblivion, but tomorrow we'll try!"
"116521668-0-10131";"The city of Wayrest may not know all you've done. But I say you've done Tamriel a service. So, for your service: take your key and your cut. And get back here tomorrow, all right?"

"116521668-0-10138";"I'm sure you'll find this worth slogging through a frothing soup of fetid muck! Take your key, your cut, and a well deserved bath … or three. Tomorrow we'll challenge more than your intestinal fortitude."

"116521668-0-10144";"Take your key, and your cut. I must have time to sit and ponder the tragic tale of the Crypt. Hopefully when we speak tomorrow, such sorrow will not be required."
"116521668-0-10152";"This prize was not fished from the guts of languid serpents, but it will do.\n\nTake your key and cut. Tomorrow I will present another opportunity to be swallowed whole."

"116521668-0-10183";"Interesting scent. Do I detect a hint of wamasu? No, that can't be right.\n\nNot how I'd do it, of course … but interesting enough to pass certification. You may now fulfill provisioning writs. Keep your pots warm and your ladle clean."
"116521668-0-10185";"Hmph. I had hoped to learn the secret to your trotter pie.\n\nNo matter, I'll certify you immediately. You may now fulfill provisioning writs. Try not to poison anyone."
"116521668-0-10188";"One less crew of marauders plaguing the seas is worth celebrating. I cheer at your conquest. In my heart.\n\nTake your rewards. Seek me again on the morrow. Our work is never done."
"116521668-0-10189";"Pirate hoards have whet your appetite for treasure. You've earned that much, at least.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Tomorrow riches may be the least of your concern."
"116521668-0-10191";"You have claimed the title and now you claim the prize. Do not grow complacent. Tomorrow a new challenge may rob you of both.\n\nTonight, take your key and spend your cut on the finer things in life."

"116521668-0-10200";"I am glad you are sane enough still to appreciate the victory.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Drown any nightmares in rich drink and good company. Approach the new dawn with renewed verve and seek me again."
"116521668-0-10201";"What more is there to be said? Your actions speak for themselves. Let mine do the same.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Seek me again. There are more deeds to be met with deeds, not words."
"116521668-0-10204";"Already done. You'll now be able to fulfill clothier crafting writs. And I look forward to seeing more of your work!"

"116521668-0-10235";"Ah. I understand, you are far too certain in your grasp of the concept.\n\nWell then, you are now certified to fulfill enchanting writs. Best of luck avoiding mistranslations. The self-immolating glyphs are quite easy to misread."
"116521668-0-10237";"Very well. You remind me of a former apprentice.\n\nNow that you're certified, you can obtain and fulfill alchemy writs. May your titrations avoid the kind of shortcuts you took today."
"116521668-0-10238";"Your potions have a slight fizz to them, but your skill with admixtures is unquestioned … far better than my former apprentice.\n\nYou are now authorized to obtain and fulfill alchemy writs. May your elixirs remain potent and your reagents fresh."
"116521668-0-10240";"A power core? For me? For all her rough edges, my sister does have a good heart.\n\nThank you for acquiring this for me. With a little tinkering, I'm sure I can use it to complete one of my many Dwemer-related experiments."
"116521668-0-10241";"Then the bandits gave their answer. Heartless dogs! They were knights, once.\n\nWhen the Lion Guard marches, they'll receive an honorable death."
"116521668-0-10244";"Indubitably! I watched the roots burn with my own eyes! The siege commander needs to hear about this so he can press the advantage and put an end to the Winterborn threat!\n\nAs for me, I'm going to relax. Somewhere in Orsinium with a very large drink."
"116521668-0-10246";"You should attach it to an item, so you can see the enchantment's effects.\n\nYou are now certified to fulfill enchanting writs. May you unravel the secrets of Nirn."
"116521668-0-10248";"Oh, almost certainly. I'm sure that dozens of naked people just fell out of trees somewhere in the wilderness.\n\nThey're probably cold, though. Maybe I should have omitted the potion of feather plucking. Left them with something to keep them warm."
"116521668-0-10249";"You're joking, right? I spent my last gold piece getting to this Three-forsaken wasteland! Bah! A pox on these Orcs and their stupid beasts!\n\nI suppose you've earned your cut, such as it is. I'll need to find a new opportunity now."
"116521668-0-10253";"I expected to find misery and death in this place. I didn't find it for myself, but still. It doesn't feel any better."
"116521668-0-10254";"I expected to find misery and death in this place. I didn't find it for myself, but still. It doesn't feel any better."
"116521668-0-10256";"I knew it! May I?\n\nI took the liberty of hiring this rather intense young lady. She deals in wild animals, you see. Ha! I can't wait to see the look on her face when I lull that beast into submission! Many thanks, friend. Here's your advance."
"116521668-0-10262";"By Malacath's swollen foot, you're an irritating one! But no, I won't have these metal monsters working alongside faithful Orcs.\n\nTake the constructs to Orsinium if you wish. Just get them out of here. My clan wants nothing more to do with them."
"116521668-0-10263";"Finally, an outsider who makes sense.\n\nWe … appreciate the Elf's intentions, but it's not our way. We'll send him away and the quarry will be ours again—just as Malacath intended."
"116521668-0-10270";"A grim tale. Someone attempted to bind Orc souls to Dwarven constructs. Even if possible, the process would destroy body and mind … to say nothing of the soul itself.\n\nIt warrants further study, yes? Yes, good."
"116521668-0-10273";"For now? No. Go explore Wrothgar and get to know this great city. Enjoy yourself!\n\nWhen you're ready for a new challenge, find me at my private tavern in the city. I'm sure I'll have something that requires your specific skill set by then."
"116521668-0-10274";"You've outdone us, friend. You've reached the heart of this Citadel before the Undaunted.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, but we'd like to give you something special to commemorate your feat!"
"116521668-0-10275";"You've outdone us, friend. You've explored the Aetherian Archive before the Undaunted.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, but we'd like to give you something special to commemorate your feat!"
"116521668-0-10284";"By the Eight! You have given me a sliver of hope on a very dark day. The Order of the Silver Dawn will rebuild and continue the mission given to us by Adeliza Silver-Axe so many years ago. \n\nThank you for all you have done!"
"116521668-0-10289";"I see. I convinced our clan that <<1>>'s victory would test our faith in Malacath's favor. They'll accept her … for now.\n\nIf she allows it, I shall advise her. She'll need all the help she can get."
"116521668-0-10298";"I see. Our clan will believe Malacath favors the loyalty <<1>> showed my son. They'll accept his victory … for now.\n\nI shall advise him, if he allows it. And I will watch for weakness in his heart. Shatul must survive."
"116521668-0-10299";"We do not mince words here. You are the chief of Shatul.\n\nGo, receive your clan."

"116521668-0-10866";"Indubitably! You've got a talent for relic hunting, and I'd be remiss if I didn't take advantage of that.\n\nHere's a list of the relics I believe await us in the wilds of Wrothgar. Find them, bring them here, and the museum will reward you handsomely."
"116521668-0-10870";"At this point? We stay patient and watchful. Also quiet. If Molag Bal catches our scent, we may lose him completely. \n\nWe have motive now, but the bones of a plot aren't enough. We need plans, names, timetables ….\n\nKeep watching. I'll do the same."
"116521668-0-10871";"I know you did your best and I'm ever so grateful.\n\nWe're going to stick together and find the nearest stronghold. We'll hire some bodyguards and make our way to Orsinium. We won't forget what you did for us. None of us will."
"116521668-0-10879";"She wouldn't deny it, of course. Followers of Boethiah are tricky like that. Far as I'm concerned, she just admitted her guilt!\n\nThank you for rooting out this fleshfly in our midst."
"116521668-0-10882";"Wonderful! And I do believe the prophecy is fulfilled. Did I … forget to mention the prophecy?\n\nAhem. ""<<1>> shall return in the hour of Wrothgar's greatest need, to a hero worthy of <<2>>'s legacy."" Seems rather direct, as these things go."
"116521668-0-10884";"You've done more for me and my people than I could have ever expected. Thank you.\n\nNow get to the temple and make sure Eveli and the high priestess are all right."
"116521668-0-10885";"Well, with or without the scroll, Egnatius is an asset. He speaks a dozen dead languages, can read a dozen more. He knows the city better than I do. He's also remarkably spry for an old person.\n\nWe'll find a use for him."
"116521668-0-10887";"A pleasure doing business with you. It's a shame about Khoruzoth, but there's nothing we can do about that. Better that his mother lives with the hope that he might come home some day.\n\nAs for Bardun and me, we'll be off soon. Best of luck to you."
"116521668-0-10888";"No, I don't want that foul thing. I want to remember Khoruzoth as my son, not as Thukhozod's legacy. I should never have let him read his father's letter.\n\nYou keep the amulet. As a thank you for letting me know what happened to my son."
"116521668-0-10889";"You came to Wrothgar to help Kurog unite our people and rebuild this great city. Despite how we got here, you accomplished everything the king asked of you.\n\nNow I have a request, if you're willing to provide one more service to the Orcs."
"116521668-0-10890";"Yes, I believe it is. Akatosh be praised. Molag Bal will lash out, but the Dragonfires are safe, thanks to you.\n\nI only wish the price had been less dear. Centuries of lonely service is a heavy burden. I will pray for the Drake—and for you."
"116521668-0-10896";"So that's how they did it …. I've been watching that garrison since the beginning. Caudex is difficult to read. Talented, but stubborn. Honestly, I'm surprised he gave this to you.\n\nI'll hold onto it for now. We'll find a use for it eventually."
"116521668-0-10900";"I knew that you would see the veracity of my claim. Now my dear Alani will have to accept my proposal and marry me!\n\nThank you for believing in me. Now just hand over the pendant and we can put this business behind us."
"116521668-0-10901";"A great service to Malacath. He shall not forget. He never forgets.\n\nAnd now his eye is upon you. Do great works of vengeance in his name."
"116521668-0-10902";"The <<1>> is yours. Wear it at your breast … let it bathe in the spattering blood of your enemies. Feed it your wrath, your hatred, your vengeance!\n\nUntil someone stronger takes your place."
"116521668-0-10909";"Your belief in me is gratifying. I thought I had lost the pendant forever, and with it my one remaining connection to my home and my parents.\n\nThank you for your help. Now give me my pendant so I can make sure I won't lose it again."
"116521668-0-10912";"I can understand if you're dubious. Skeptical. I would be. All I ask is that you go to the districts and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-10917";"So. Yes. I'll hold onto the key for now. I suspect we'll need it sooner rather than later.\n\nThank you for recovering it—and for finding Regilus. I'm glad someone was there. At the end."
"116521668-0-10918";"For now, we stay watchful. This book is obviously connected to a greater plot. I'll be in touch once I figure out what the Sublime Brazier has to do with the invasion.\n\nSo, yes. I'm reading now. Can you go, please? You're in my light."
"116521668-0-10920";"Excellent! Let's see what the Worm Cult is planning."
"116521668-0-10921";"I'll smuggle these people out through the sewers. Eight willing, I'll be back again tomorrow to take a few more. Here's your gold, as promised.\n\nBe careful out there."
"116521668-0-10925";"Ha! That it was.\n\nLet Malacath gaze upon you. Let him see you are strong enough to deny the will of a Daedric Prince. May he never forget."
"116521668-0-10927";"You're dubious. Skeptical. That's good. All I ask is that you consider it and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-10928";"And I you.\n\nTake this. It belonged to Kurog, but you earned it. I hope I can do as much for my people as you did for Orsinium. I will do my best to live up to the faith that you and the clan chiefs have seen in me."
"116521668-0-10930";"Ah, you warm this one's heart. I pity any Daedra foolish enough to touch those casks now. You have my thanks, walker.\n\nI will likely return to the Temple District soon—perhaps in a day or two. If you wish to aid me again, you'll find me there."
"116521668-0-10933";"So you returned the helm and slew the creature that took his life. Huh.\n\nYou did Corgrak a great honor. Here, he'd want you to have this. Walk in Malacath's shadow."
"116521668-0-10934";"You're dubious. Skeptical. That's good. All I ask is that you consider it and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-10935";"Have faith! A sculpture begins as a block of stone. A masterful painting? Nothing but canvas on the board.\n\nTime to assemble this for <<1>>. Soon, all shall witness my glorious homage to Wrothgar's ogres!"
"116521668-0-10937";"Ah, well some is better than none. These are in remarkable condition, all things considered.\n\nYou've done me a great service. No—you've done all of Tamriel a great service, though they may never know it. You have my deepest thanks."
"116521668-0-10941";"My heart plummets at the news you bring, and all the light departs from my sky.\n\nI will take the <<1>>, though. I do not know if I can do this without my Jaeloreh, but I won't let her dream die, too. Thank you."
"116521668-0-10943";"I knew you could do it! I wish I could see the look on their smug, glowy-eyed faces. Priceless!\n\nI'm going to go gather some supplies. Should be headed back out there in a day or so. If you're looking to cause a little more havoc, meet me there."
"116521668-0-10946";"So you did! And here's your payment, as promised. \n\nIf you find yourself in the Nobles District again anytime soon, keep an eye out for me. Reliable partners are hard to come by out here. Take care."
"116521668-0-10948";"Ah. Though the return of this document means we can legally set up shop in Orsinium, it brings no joy to my heart. <<1>> was more than our partner, she was my love.\n\nStill, you have my gratitude. May the sun and stars shine a light upon your path."
"116521668-0-10969";"Ah, excellent. These pelts look perfect! Well, maybe not perfect—but it's not as if the werewolves were happy to hand their skins over, am I right? Well done.\n\nHere's your payment. I hope we can work together again soon."
"116521668-0-10970";"Nicely done! I knew I could count on you.\n\nI'll get these pelts to market just as soon as I finish my drink. Thanks again, friend."
"116521668-0-10972";"Good! Those filthy traitors dishonor High-King Emeric and the Lionguard. The sooner we're rid of them, the better.\n\nI doubt this raid will scatter them for good, but I'm sure it rattled the cages. You have my thanks, and that of the Covenant."
"116521668-0-10973";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10975";"Excellent! Wow, they're much larger than I expected. Much fleshier, too. Mara's heart.\n\nWell, I suppose that's that! Here's your payment. Thanks for all your help. I'm sure these will make someone very happy."
"116521668-0-10977";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10978";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10979";"Wonderful! I'm certain that this time I have the data I need to complete my experiments. And don't worry—I'll cite your contribution when the results are published.\n\nMany thanks, friend!"
"116521668-0-10981";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10982";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10983";"<Planting my Alliance banner here will mark the rally point as secure.>"
"116521668-0-10984";"What a relief. Getting folks to trust durzogs is hard enough without some half-crazed Nord sicking them on people.\n\nI'll put this food to good use. If you meet anyone who's in the market for a good strong hound, you send them my way, all right?"
"116521668-0-10986";"You've done us a tremendous service, friend. There are still many lost souls bound to that wretched place, but we can be proud that at least a few have made it to the Ashen Forge. You have my thanks."
"116521668-0-10996";"Their worth is considerable. And we'd be able to keep our quotas as we build back up.\n\nYou're right. Thank you for letting me see beyond my rage."
"116521668-0-11002";"You located the stolen supplies? Trinimac surely has sent you to us in our time of need! Take this as a reward for helping our people. And you must present yourself to Forge-Mother Alga and tell her everything.\n\nOh look, here she comes now."
"116521668-0-11004";"I'm not sure which pleases me more. Either way, the workers get to eat—and not a minute too soon. These immigrants bleat like goats when they're hungry.\n\nDon't stray too far, all right? I'm sure we'll need more meat soon. Thanks again."
"116521668-0-11008";"Capital! Hmm, the cover's a bit bent and the pages are showing some boxing. Still, I appreciate your efforts.\n\nI'll need more of these pages recovered eventually. I did bring several dozen copies of the book, after all. I hope you'll be available."
"116521668-0-11010";"Do you feel it within your own heart—that righteous simmer of hatred? It is the gift you earned today. \n\nGo. Avenge yourself of every slight and transgression. Spread my wrath!"
"116521668-0-11011";"Today you rekindled the simmer of hatred at the heart of the Orcs. May it fuel their vengeance for another generation.\n\nGo. Spread my wrath to the corners of the world!"
"116521668-0-11012";"You have done well, but we can ill afford complacency! More corruption will come to threaten the wild, I know it. We must be prepared. \n\nI will remain here … unless they stop serving this bread. Farewell."
"116521668-0-11023";"Tava bless you, my child. I shudder at the thought of what that beast and his minions could have done. You have my thanks and my blessing.\n\nI trust that Tava's winds will steer you back here when the time is right. For now, go in peace."
"116521668-0-11026";"This one should feel relief, yes? But these machines are never truly dead, are they? What if Nyzchaleft returns? Birkhu could not bear it if more explorers came to harm because of his stupidity.\n\nBirkhu will stay here to drink—I mean, keep watch."
"116521668-0-11037";"Hmm. I'm grateful for your service, friend. I wish I could say with certainty that this won't happen again, but Riekr are stubborn brutes. I'm afraid we may call on you again before long. Farewell."
"116521668-0-11038";"You have done enough for today. Though lives were lost, thanks to you others were saved.\n\nTake this for your efforts. And keep your ears open. We will contact you when the king again has need of your services."
"116521668-0-11060";"You may believe her lies, but I won't let her get away with murder. She'll pay me the blood price or she'll die!"

"116521668-0-11185";"You helped restore the Thieves Guild—make it more than it once was. Of course I trust your judgment. Now, all the old business is put to rest.\n\nLet's go. We have a guild to run."
"116521668-0-11186";"You helped restore the Thieves Guild—make it more than it once was. Of course I trust your judgment. Now, all the old business is put to rest.\n\nLet's go. We have a guild to run."
"116521668-0-11196";"Reassuring, isn't it? Knowing the Daedra can suffer. I could kill them all day. You too, it seems.\n\nYour key and your cut. See me tomorrow, I'll find you something equally rewarding."
"116521668-0-11208";"I hope she had an unceremonious drop shortly after! Did you make a few choice gestures Coldharbour's way while you were up there? Believe I would.\n\nI've got an empress's ransom right here. Take it! Until tomorrow."
"116521668-0-11232";"Now that she knows I'm around? I expect her to double her efforts and use every advantage her family's gold can buy. It's what I'd do.\n\nThanks for assisting me with this, by the way. Once I decide on my next course of action, I'll let you know."
"116521668-0-11236";"Excellent! I just hope no other pirate crews are stupid enough to try to loot the old tomb.\n\nI'm glad to have Spiritcatcher back, but I won't see you leave empty handed. Take this as a token of my gratitude for what you have done."
"116521668-0-11238";"All these wasted years, we've missed out on so much. Narahni wears them like a cloak—though with grace and style.\n\nI am … grateful … you convinced her to come here."
"116521668-0-11239";"Well, that's something at least. I just wish we hadn't lost another Sister along the way.\n\nThat's enough for now, Assassin. <<1>> and I have much to discuss."
"116521668-0-11244";"They'll accept her … for now.\n\nIf she allows it, I shall advise her. She'll need all the help she can get."
"116521668-0-11249";"Back to Morrowind, I suppose. Or maybe I'll stick around the Gold Coast for awhile. See the sights. Take in the ambiance.\n\nIf you have some free time, hero, let's get together. Work on our mutual cooperation. Who knows? You might even enjoy it."
"116521668-0-11252";"Of course, just as you suggested.\n\nAnd the forged letters you planted worked perfectly! Pimsy is free! I'll help him start his new life as a free Argonian!"
"116521668-0-11258";"Not bad. We'll have some heat on us for a little while, but the goods will still move. They always do.\n\nHere's your take, boss. Until next time."
"116521668-0-11260";"Grave. I kid, of course, but with the buyers spooked I'll need to offload them through different channels. Your work was still worth a good bit, so don't worry about it.\n\nHere's your take, boss. Keep it someplace less dusty, eh?"
"116521668-0-11262";"Our buyers were quite pleased with their ""inheritance"" and our fee reflects all your added care. I think you'll be quite pleased.\n\nYou've spent enough time in tombs today. Go out and live a little—I'll have something else lined up by tomorrow."
"116521668-0-11265";"You outdid yourself this time. Thanks to your skill we got an even bigger payday than normal. Nice work."
"116521668-0-11270";"They tried to make a fuss about the traces you left during the job, but <<1>> knows the value of a little blackmail to ensure the agreed upon price.\n\nYour share, boss. It may not have the beauty of stones, but I find the jingle quite fetching."
"116521668-0-11271";"Their eyes shone brighter than the stones themselves. It was a simple thing to get them to part with a little extra for the flawless services you provided.\n\nYour cut, boss. Enjoy."
"116521668-0-11275";"Crime is dirty business, boss. Best to discourage it from getting dirtier. Show that we are squeamish and soon everyone will keep their precious things in outhouses and chamber pots.\n\nHave a soak and count your coin, it'll improve your mood."
"116521668-0-11277";"I didn't think grime could stick to one so slick as you, boss. The buyers were quite pleased with the pace with which the goods passed through and dumped a tidy sum on our doorstep.\n\nGold has a way of clearing the air, does it not?"
"116521668-0-11285";"Of course, just as you suggested.\n\nAnd the forged letters worked perfectly. Pimsy's days of slavery are over—his new life starts today."
"116521668-0-11289";"What a ridiculous question!\n\nTashmin is … he's part of this family. And it's a better family than the one I was born into, believe me."
"116521668-0-11296";"Of course, boss, I'm eager to see you in action. Bring me a posting and we'll be on our way."
"116521668-0-11299";"There always seems to be something weird with those noble types. I think they go stir crazy without honest work. Not like us.\n\nIf they want to part with their fortunes willingly, you won't get complaints from me. Or you, I'd wager."
"116521668-0-11302";"Looks like it's seen better days, but I'm sure that's no fault of yours. I'll have it mended and return it to its rightful owner. He's a good man, and if this will bring him some comfort I'm glad we could help.\n\nAnother job well done."
"116521668-0-11303";"So you did! Some of the sailors you freed already made it back to Abah's Landing as well. Seems they told the captain about you and he's offering to pay us a bit extra for the effort. \n\nNot a bad day's work. I appreciate the help, my friend."
"116521668-0-11304";"Hard to picture a noble wearing this, isn't it? I thought so too. Her husband was a pauper. She had more wealth than he could dream of, but he insisted on buying her ring. Can't put a price on that.\n\nSee you tomorrow then, if you're available."
"116521668-0-11305";"Ha! You did! May not look like much, but it'll make a world o' difference to the old hand. Funny how objects take root in a body, after so long they just seem to become part of a person.\n\nHere's your pay, as promised."
"116521668-0-11308";"Got the day off in Aldcroft? Can't say I envy you. Gloomy town. Save for this one Argonian. You'd know her if you saw her. Runs a winery. Loves her product as much as I do. It warms my heart. Oh wait. I had to kill her. Pity.\n\nYour gold. Good work."
"116521668-0-11309";"Throwing dagger? No? I don't know why no one else finds that funny. The last time I visited Daggerfall Castle, I left mine in a sentry. Had to borrow another one from the kitchen. Decent sandwiches. Had three before I left.\n\nAnyway, here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11310";"Daggerfall's docks are a tricky place. Lots of trade, lots of witnesses. Great place to pick up a bargain, though. Bought a whole crate of local funerary decorations a while back. Little touch of home for the departed.\n\nGot your pay right here."
"116521668-0-11311";"Daggerfall has these curious little sausages in a sweet brine. Addictive as Skooma and twice as tasty. Reminds me of a contract. Client wanted the target's pinkies sliced off. Ah, memories!\n\nNext time, bring back a few sausages. Here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11312";"Another corpse for Cath Bedraud—let's hope it stays put! Used to be a good place to think before the dead started shambling about.\n\nDon't worry. You completed the contract. It's not our fault if some people don't have the good graces to stay dead."
"116521668-0-11313";"Maybe a cute little Wood Elf to warm up my bed, but I'd probably fall asleep before we got to the good stuff.\n\nJust stay sharp, New-blade. The roots of our trouble stretch deep below the soil. Things are going to get worse, my friend. Mark my words."
"116521668-0-11317";"Then I believe a new title is in order, Initiate. You've demonstrated skills and abilities that we will definitely need in the battles to come.\n\nStand tall, Assassin. You've earned your place in the Brotherhood and we're proud to have you among us."
"116521668-0-11318";"Would you prefer punishment to praise, Assassin? Let the Black Hand decide how we navigate these troubled waters. For now, work your contracts. Sharpen your skills.\n\nThe Black Dragon will pay for her transgressions, as will her master, Artorius."
"116521668-0-11319";"Eventually. When Artorius feels the time is right. But he'll hesitate to make the first move, to send his soldiers into our viper's nest. We have time to prepare.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll confer with the Speaker. When you return, the Primate will die."
"116521668-0-11320";"And this is for you—shrouded armor, the uniform of the Dark Brotherhood. You're one of the family now. You might as well look the part.\n\nPerform well and you'll rise in the ranks of the Brotherhood. I'm sure you'll make us all proud."
"116521668-0-11323";"I hope you're right. But why do the Akatosh priests seem to be moving against us? First the Sermonizers, now this. Are they trying to take advantage of our recent setbacks or is there something more going on here?\n\nAt least Hildegard is safe now."
"116521668-0-11335";"Regarding Artorius and the Black Dragon? No. That threat has passed.\n\nBut there is one more thing. Step back, Assassin, and prepare yourself."
"116521668-0-11336";"And I'll see to Hildegard's punishment personally. But I'm more disturbed by the priests of Akatosh. First the Sermonizers, now this. Are they just trying to take advantage of our recent setbacks or is there something more going on here?"
"116521668-0-11340";"You're dubious. Skeptical. That's good. All I ask is that you consider it and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-11341";"I can understand if you're dubious. Skeptical. I would be. All I ask is that you go to the districts and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-11342";"You're dubious. Skeptical. That's good. All I ask is that you consider it and stay watchful. I'll do the same. Small beginnings and such. Simple.\n\nIf you're half as capable as I think you are, we'll be meeting again soon."
"116521668-0-11345";"As promised, your reward. \n\nYou have done a great service for Arkay and for me. The souls of my brave friends may rest easy now, knowing their sacrifice did not go unanswered. These pauldrons will find a place of honor in the Temple of Arkay."
"116521668-0-11346";"You … you did? That's fantastic news. For the common good, I mean. Safety above all, that's my motto.\n\nAnd these ledgers will do just fine. Here's some gold for your trouble."
"116521668-0-11349";"Wonderful! Once I get the new dig underway, I'm sure we'll make progress quickly. I can't believe that not long ago, this was just a smoking hole in the ground. Now we may have uncovered the complex that gave Tribune's Folly its name!"
"116521668-0-11353";"And a well-earned reward it is! I haven't seen a beating that brutal since the Spear Sisters bested the Iron Lion in nothing but their smallclothes.\n\nHere's the victory purse. I suggest you live a little before your next dance with death!"
"116521668-0-11355";"You did well to disrupt the Order's preparations and your reward includes a bonus to reflect that. I just wish we hadn't lost another Sister along the way.\n\nBut that's all for now, Assassin. <<1>> and I have much to discuss."
"116521668-0-11357";"A chance to beat your record. How many of the Sermonizer's priests did you murder, anyway?\n\nSeriously, New-blade, stay sharp out there. The roots of our trouble stretch deep below the soil. Things are going to get worse, my friend. Mark my words."
"116521668-0-11372";"Let's see what you nicked … Not much, is it? A few more unruly bards getting a lesson in tragedy is worth something though. \n\nHere's your cut."
"116521668-0-11373";"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. So you did. I guess we'll see how good this lot is at improvisation.\n\nHere's your pay, plus a bonus to please keep this stuff away from Andarri."
"116521668-0-11374";"No kidding. Did you rob a whole troupe or something? Maybe they'll think twice about mouthing off about us in the future.\n\nHave a night on the town courtesy of the guild."
"116521668-0-11376";"Let's see how many that actually is … Hm. Thought it would be more.\n\nIt's easy arithmetic, at least. Here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11377";"Oh? Let me tally it. Yes, uh-huh, ouch—stupid, sharp—all right. This should put a dent in their business, and their egos.\n\nGood work, your pay."
"116521668-0-11378";"Oof, it's heavy! Just shear the sheep, don't steal the whole mutton.\n\nShaking up those laborers is worth a good bit to the guild. Here, you earned it."
"116521668-0-11384";"And this is for you—shrouded armor, the uniform of the Dark Brotherhood. You're one of the family now. You might as well look the part. And since you showed such expertise with the Blade of Woe, take this as well.\n\nI expect great things, Initiate."
"116521668-0-11386";"Ah, Cloudy Dregs. Coziest hearth in Stormhaven. Does the pretty blonde crooner still sing there? Can't remember her name, but I'll never forget her voice. She had a lovely scream.\n\nGot your gold right here."
"116521668-0-11388";"I'm sure no one will notice a little more gloom at the Dusklight Inn. If I lived out there, I'd be in a drunken stupor every waking hour to forget that fact.\n\nHope the pay was worth the bother."
"116521668-0-11389";"Oldgate has all the charm of a jailhouse door clanging shut behind you. Last threshold on the path to a new and dismal life. You did someone a mercy out there.\n\nHere, your thanks for a life cut short."
"116521668-0-11390";"I find it telling that the Wayrest Castle balconies overlook the treasury instead of the sunset, which is beautiful by the way. Gold will be the death of that dynasty.\n\nSpeaking of gold, good work."
"116521668-0-11391";"You'd think Wayrest was the center of the universe with the way its citizens carry on. I recall having a conversation with one of the locals. He made a very persuasive point. Then I stuck my dagger in his eye.\n\nSave this for your next visit."
"116521668-0-11392";"Koeglin Village is a bit of a hidden jewel. Best fresh crustaceans you'll ever taste, sold right in their markets. I weep for the day the traders in Wayrest catch on.\n\nAnyway, your pay."
"116521668-0-11393";"Oh, I love Alcaire Castle. Did you see the waterfall? Bubbles up from an underground river. Best place in the entire region to make a body disappear.\n\nHere you go. For your savings."
"116521668-0-11394";"What did you think of the Sisters of the Sands? I don't think anyone can appreciate the feel of cold stone until they've baked in the Alik'r sun. I left three brothers tied up and baking in the sun once. Good times!\n\nYour gold."
"116521668-0-11395";"Shornhelm, right? What a sorry sight that place is since King Ranser's War. The cook in the Dead Wolf Inn might be that place's one saving grace. Sithis knows why she's still there.\n\nHere's your due for the trouble."
"116521668-0-11396";"If you need proof of a Redguard's tenacity, just look at Castle Sentinel. Can you imagine forging a thing of that scale and beauty in such a wasteland? Always give a Redguard a few extra strikes before calling the job done.\n\nSpeaking of, good work."
"116521668-0-11397";"Did you try the candied scorpions in Bergama? They have a delightful bite to them. Especially if you neglect to clip the stinger first. I know a confectioner who is happy to overlook that detail for the right price.\n\nPayment's the same, in any case."
"116521668-0-11398";"A trip to the Fighters Guild? Exciting work. I do so enjoy sending those sell-swords to the Void. You'd think they'd be harder to kill, but they bleed as red as any other target. Maybe a bit redder.\n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-11399";"I do love a contract that gets to the point. Why so many feel the need to justify their reasons to us, I'll never know. I suspect it's more to convince themselves, but I've never had the opportunity to ask.\n\nHere's your pay for the contract."
"116521668-0-11401";"Shornhelm. The gloom is so thick, your targets literally leap onto your blade. What we do for them is a mercy, really. It's where I go when I'm in a particularly merciful mood.\n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-11402";"Anchor Point Inn. Fairly unremarkable, but I always stop by for an ale or two if I'm in the area. Besides, they rarely inquire about all the blood. I appreciate that in an innkeeper.\n\nHere you go. This should put a smile on your face."
"116521668-0-11403";"Evermore, huh? Ever-bore is more like it. I find the place dreadfully dull. You'd think a murder spree and a daring escape from the city guard would be exciting. But in Evermore? Not so much.  \n\nSpeaking of not so much, here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11404";"Another good way to dispose of a body? Toss it in a blazing hot forge. And as an added benefit, the neighborhood smells like a pork roast for at least a week! Hmm. Oh, now I'm hungry.\n\nYour payment, as usual."
"116521668-0-11405";"Never could stand mages. All that power, but they put their robes on one arm at a time, am I right? Strangled a mage with her robe once. Spent the next month as a mudcrab when I triggered that damn ward ….\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11420";"What else would a book provided by the Listener contain? Determine each target and assassinate them. Beyond that, the will of Sithis isn't for you or I to question.\n\nYour task won't be easy, but the Listener has faith that you will succeed."
"116521668-0-11421";"Cake? I don't know. This one came out so well, I might just keep it for myself.\n\nJust kidding! You earned this special cake. Wait until you taste it! I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised."
"116521668-0-11428";"Bet she erected a few choice spines after you destroyed her insane scribblings! She look more like an angry porcupine, or a scared cat? Either way, I'll be drinking to you tonight! \n\nTake your due and come back tomorrow. Just don't make it early."
"116521668-0-11429";"Those Xit-Xaht didn't put up the fight I'd hoped. You're not even limping! Still, you did as I asked.\n\nHere's your key and cut. Tomorrow I'll at least try to maim you a little."
"116521668-0-11430";"Cut the head off the serpent—Lizard? Whatever—the body dies with it. The Xit-Xaht are scattered and leaderless. They won't be bothering anyone anytime soon, even if they do survive.\n\nYou earned your key and cut today. Do it again tomorrow."
"116521668-0-11431";"You've revived my memories of the Barons Who Move Like This! I must go and re-corporate them while the memories are still fresh. Then, we shall begin to conquer the Aurbis!\n\nOh! And thank you. Please accept an award appropriate to your station."
"116521668-0-11434";"Let's see how many that actually is … Hm. Thought it would be more.\n\nIt's easy arithmetic, at least. Here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11435";"Someone told me recently that crime doesn't pay. Isn't that the dumbest thing you've ever heard?\n\nHere's your cut."
"116521668-0-11436";"Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort."
"116521668-0-11443";"Let's see how many that actually is … Hm. Thought it would be more.\n\nIt's easy arithmetic, at least. Here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11444";"Oh? Let me tally it. Yes, uh-huh, ouch—stupid, sharp—all right. This should put a dent in their business, and their egos.\n\nGood work, your pay."
"116521668-0-11445";"Oof, it's heavy! Just shear the sheep, don't steal the whole mutton.\n\nShaking up those laborers is worth a good bit to the guild. Here, you earned it."

"116521668-0-11477";"Oh, I know you did. People are already talking about the rash of break-ins. I can hardly keep up with the flood of merchants making ""security deposits"" with the guild.\n\nI've got your cut of that right here."
"116521668-0-11478";"Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort. \n\nIf we keep this up, the whole Landing will know that the Thieves Guild is back."
"116521668-0-11479";"Just one lockbox? You know the point was to stir things up. Oh well, you're chipping in. I'll note it in the log.\n\nHere's your pay."

"116521668-0-11486";"Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort. \n\nIf we keep this up, the whole Landing will know that the Thieves Guild is back."
"116521668-0-11487";"Just one lockbox? You know the point was to stir things up. Oh well, you're chipping in. I'll note it in the log.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11501";"We Dark Elves tend to think of fortresses as less of a protective barrier and more of a means to discreetly organize one's enemies. Is it odd that I sleep better in a den of assassins than I ever did at home?\n\nHere, for your work."
"116521668-0-11502";"Mournhold's a nice place to visit, but … well, you know. I do get a little homesick on occasion. A night of dusky beauties and sujamma scrib-jelly shots are hard to come by on the Gold Coast.\n\nHere. Save a little for your next visit."
"116521668-0-11503";"I do enjoy contracts to eliminate those Fighters Guild buffoons. All that armor and weapons and they still don't have eyes in the back of their heads. They expect everyone to face them head on and fight fair, the fools.\n\nHere's to easy marks."
"116521668-0-11504";"Gods that walk around and greet followers give me the shivers, don't you agree? I prefer ancient and unknowable deities. Separation of church and state, as it were. And at least Sithis only asks for blood.\n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-11505";"Fort Amol? Never heard of it. I killed a Forn Amil once, near a river that ran past a fort. Or was that on a cliff overlooking a ford? I really should start writing my memoirs one of these days ….\n\nAnyway, here's your pay."
"116521668-0-11506";"Never had much use for royalty. Kings and queens, expecting everyone to kneel and grovel. I made a target kneel and grovel once, just to see what it was like. I suppose I could get used to it, but I enjoyed slitting his throat even better.\n\nYour pay."
"116521668-0-11507";"Drink on the job? It's not against the Tenets. I often share an ale with a target. Get to know them a bit, let them enjoy one last pleasure. Then I follow them into the shadows and … you know.\n\nIf you want to buy me an ale later, just say the word."
"116521668-0-11508";"I'm fond of the beaches around Vulkhel Guard. Lots of mudcrabs. Great for making a body disappear. And they're good steamed and cracked, too. But not after they went to town on a body. That's just unsanitary.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11509";"Poison. An interesting tool. I used it once. A splash in the mushroom gravy at one of the Queen's banquets. Got my target, but also killed seventeen other guests. Missed the Queen, though. Apparently she's not fond of mushrooms. Or gravy.\n\nYour gold."
"116521668-0-11510";"Nobles, am I right? Snap their fingers and pay their gold, and we'll just kill whoever they point at. I suppose that's what we do, but it still rankles my feathers. That's why I collect noble ears. Just doing my part for the common folk.\n\nYour pay."
"116521668-0-11511";"I actually have fond memories of the Redfur Trading Post. Fresh Grahtwood game roasted in Khajiiti spices—the finest food served on a stick you can find. And after you've eaten your fill, use the stick to make your next kill.\n\nHere. Your gold."
"116521668-0-11512";"Did you carve your initials into the Elden Tree, or just your target? I find it hard to get excited about an overgrown log, but I can certainly appreciate its scale. You think it ever bears fruit? Now that might be something to fuss about.\n\nYour pay."
"116521668-0-11513";"I don't expect you to last a week, but as long as you're still here ….\n\nReady for your first contract, Initiate?"
"116521668-0-11514";"Ah, the Outside Inn. My only regret during my last stay was not lodging my daggers in the little wag running the place. I swear, he laughs himself silly every time he says his establishment's insipid name.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11515";"I recall a moon-sugar glazed ham I bought at the Baandari Trading Post. This was ages ago. It made my tongue tingle, but left me with this blissful contentment. Made the four assassinations I had to do that much more enjoyable.\n\nHere, your gold."
"116521668-0-11516";"Kor and I went hunting in Malabal Tor once. No, not that kind of hunting! We were stalking the prey with two legs. Wood Elves, to be exact. It was a close contest, but I beat Kor by a nose. And an ear.\n\nHere. You earned this."
"116521668-0-11518";"Raz wishes you the best of luck, my friend, but Vvardenfell is a bit out of my jurisdiction.\n\nIf they show themselves in the Dominion, Raz will deal with them. But in Dark Elf lands? That's someone else's problem, yes?"
"116521668-0-11519";"I bought a potted fern in Vulkwasten. Had the notion to nurture a green thumb. Not my knack, as it were. Only thing I've unintentionally killed in nearly a decade.\n\nBest stick to what comes natural, right? Your gold."
"116521668-0-11520";"Wood Elves! Never could stand the little gnats. Do they always have to be so cheerful? There's nothing as annoying as a target that smiles and laughs all the while you're slicing them open from stomach to stern. \n\nAnyway, here's your pay."
"116521668-0-11521";"Nords. Even their cheese is bigger and bolder than those of the other races. I once killed a Thane with a wheel of Nord cheese loosed from a cart at the top of a hill. As Sithis is my witness, her guards, as well.\n\nBefore I forget, your gold."
"116521668-0-11522";"Windhelm. You know they dunk their sweetrolls in mead. Only the Nords, am I right? Speaking of which, we received a mysterious package full of sweetrolls today. I recommend avoiding the temptation. Never trust an unannounced dessert, I always say."
"116521668-0-11523";"Wish everybody was making the same effort. Let's see what you've got. Mm. Mmhmm. Not bad. It's yours, plus a little extra for the effort."
"116521668-0-11526";"Eastmarch. Too much snow and too many Nords for my taste. But speaking of taste, I did try that Voljar's mead once. Awful stuff! I had to kill three drunks and a bard to get the taste out of my mouth! \n\nYour gold. Oh, and don't spend it on the mead."
"116521668-0-11529";"A few words and a handshake don't make you safe. They certainly didn't protect that ambassador from my blade. But I do enjoy visiting embassies. I find their many nooks and crannies make the perfect spots for quiet assassinations.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11530";"You seem to be getting the hang of this. I do enjoy watching a blade become honed and keen. Speaking of which, remember to sharpen your weapon before a job. Too late, I realized my blade was dull. The cut I made was embarrassingly ragged.\n\nYour pay."
"116521668-0-11531";"Despite the name, Bramblebreach is remarkably pleasant. They have a talent for cooking with insects that makes me curious how they'd approach scrib. Hmm. I remember a kwama miner. Killed him with his own prod. Good times!\n\nHere. Your payment."
"116521668-0-11533";"Good archery school in Marbruk, if that's your sort of thing. I have a fondness for target shooting myself, but I find the bow too impersonal when it comes to work. I prefer close-quarter killing to ranged any day.\n\nHere you go. For the job."
"116521668-0-11534";"Nothing like a Khajiiti bazaar to alleviate boredom. If you find yourself in a rut, spend an hour browsing the stalls. Just leave your purse at home. Come to think of it, don't. Hunting the cutpurse who robbed you is an even better cure.\n\nYour pay."
"116521668-0-11535";"I must admit, your skills get better with every contract you complete. In fact, the Matron told me that if you complete one more contract in record time, I should put your name on the next sheet of paper.\n\nThat's a Brotherhood joke. No, seriously."
"116521668-0-11536";"Thalmor bureaucrats are some of the most humorless people I've ever murdered. I used some of my best material on one target and he barely cracked a smile as I gutted him. There's just no accounting for taste.\n\nOh, here's your pay."
"116521668-0-11537";"I'm quite fond of horses. Lightly salted, roasted over a roaring flame. If you grew up eating guar, you'd understand that riding a horse is just a waste of good food.\n\nHere, your gold."
"116521668-0-11538";"I hunted a Khajiit once. Well, more than once, but I'm telling this story. She knew I was tracking her almost immediately. Led me on a wild chase. Then decided to slip back and ambush me. That was her fatal mistake. I always drop caltrops behind me."
"116521668-0-11540";"Don't get all sentimental on me, hero. We both have our paths to follow. Damn, that sounded like a Fate-Bearer, didn't it?\n\nLook, let me leave you with a single kiss. One really good kiss. If you ever want another one, come find me in Vvardenfell."
"116521668-0-11542";"Watching blood matches! What a waste! Anyone who pays to watch two people bash each other to death is an uneducated barbarian! By the way, I saw how you took down your latest target. I especially appreciated the spray of blood at the end. Well done!"
"116521668-0-11543";"Argonians, right? Green-Venom-Tongue aside, on the whole the lizards make for a strange set of luggage. Even the ones I've murdered were unfathomable. I tried to discuss it with a target once, but he kept talking about mud and bugs. Infuriating!"
"116521668-0-11544";"Death by assassin. I suppose there are worse ways to enter the Void. But to pay us to end your life? And I thought I'd seen everything! Don't pass it on, but I'd cut your throat just for the fun of it if you asked nicely.\n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-11545";"I visited Stormhold once when it was still in Dark Elf hands. Must make for some awkward town meetings since the Argonians took it back. I imagine the Shadowscales keep quite busy.\n\nYou too, by the look of it. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-11546";"I raise the spine of ridiculousness in your general direction. Ha! Those lizards, am I right? After one contract, the client was so pleased that she made me a pair of boots—using the Argonian I just killed at her request!\n\nAh, memories. Your pay."
"116521668-0-11547";"Hmm. I don't think this contract was intended for us. We've got the gold, and you've done the deed, so we'll just call this bit of poaching a happy accident—or the will of Sithis, whichever you prefer.\n\nThere's your due."
"116521668-0-11550";"Back from Ebonheart? Did you try the blackened snake hearts? I grew so fond of them while working in the area. Come to think of it, one contract called for the death of the region's best chef.\n\nBlackened snake hearts never tasted the same after that."
"116521668-0-11551";"Feeling a little flush after all that work—or is that just arterial spray? It's a cutthroat business out there, and the Gold Coast Mercenaries know that all too well.\n\nPayment, as promised."
"116521668-0-11552";"Never fancied military service. I prefer death be delivered in a more intimate fashion. I'm sure the Night Mother feels the same way. You don't see us marching armies out for slaughter, after all.\n\nNeither here, nor there, I suppose. Here, payment."
"116521668-0-11553";"House Dres. Even as a Dark Elf, I never could abide slavery. At least murder is swift and sure. A slave dies slowly, one arduous task at a time. It's enough to make the Night Mother weep!\n\nBut on to more cheerful discourse—here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11554";"Nimalten's just one more bump on the road beyond Riften, but there's a good reason to stop there—goat cheese curds dipped in hot oil and honey. The hot oil can also be used to take down a target.\n\nTalk about mixing business with pleasure!"
"116521668-0-11555";"I often employ slaughterfish for challenging contracts. I hate not doing the job myself, but you have to admire those teeth that swim. I've seen them reduce a Nord to bones faster than Tanek can throw a knife. Today's lesson: everything is a weapon."
"116521668-0-11560";"The carrion beetles of the Alik'r can strip the flesh from a corpse in a day. Today's lesson: If you come across bleached bones in the desert sun, be wary. The carrion beetles may still be hungry\n\nSo, there's your tip and here's your pay."
"116521668-0-11563";"The Summerset Isles. A murder spree there can be beautiful this time of year. I remember one time when Astara and I were sent on competing contracts. This was before she became the Matron. Anyway, she …. Oh no, I probably shouldn't tell this story."
"116521668-0-11564";"A Nord once told me that Reachmen eat stones. Something about hardening the body. From the ones I know, it must only apply to their heads. Mostly I'm just saying they're thick, but I did shatter a sword against a Reach skull once.\n\nPayment, as usual."
"116521668-0-11567";"I spent some time with a woman in Bangkorai once. Those river crustaceans she prepared with pepper spice were magic! Oh, this was after I killed her husband. Turns out, she paid for the contract! It's a small world, I tell you.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11568";"Lesson for today: Never get between a Nord and his mead. Or his rabbit meatballs, for that matter. I've used both to lure the fools to their deaths. But you know what? Give a Nord a mead and a rabbit meatball and he dies happy.\n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-11571";"Someone really had an ax to grind with the Dark Elves. Good thing they didn't know who's on the other side of the contract, am I right? The truth is, we're just as awful to each other, so they shouldn't take it personally. Still, they paid good gold."
"116521668-0-11575";"I never could understand Nord politics. It seems to involve lots of yelling and copious amounts of mead. Still, if they're willing to pay for our services, who am I to complain?\n\nHere. For you."
"116521668-0-11579";"Glenumbra. If not for all the Bretons, it would be a perfectly quaint little community. Glad to see you were able to reduce their numbers by a few.\n\nOh, and excellent work on that contract, by the way. You really earned this."
"116521668-0-11583";"Here's today's lesson: What do the Wood Elves value above all else? Trees! Isn't that a kick in the pants? I once held back a legion of Grahtwood guards by threatening to pull a small tree out of the ground, roots and all.\n\nAt least they pay well."
"116521668-0-11587";"Wood Elves. They're so small, you have to kill at least three of them to get any blood on your blade. From what I can tell, you must have slaughtered an entire village.\n\nKeep up the good work."
"116521668-0-11591";"Is it better to kill one target with excellence or a multitude with mediocrity? I say, as long as they're all dead, who in Oblivion cares?\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-11595";"On the subject of murder, what would you say is the most perfect weapon for the job? Wrong! As long as the target winds up dead, there's no such thing as an imperfect weapon!\n\nStyle, on the other hand, counts for everything. Here's your gold."
"116521668-0-11600";"We're a scary bunch, I'll grant you that. But with bloodfiends, werewolves, and so much else, what's another horror lurking in the shadows for a place like Rivenspire?\n\nYour employer seems satisfied, so I guess you were suitably frightening. There."
"116521668-0-11604";"All that fuss over a swamp? Unbelievable! Did I ever tell you about my travels in Black Marsh? More souls went to Sithis and more bodies sank into the mud during my visit, I'm proud to admit. But I also got red-sore fever.\n\nYou had to remind me."
"116521668-0-11608";"Kill anyone I know while you were away? Not that I'd mind. This is the only family I care about these days. That goes for you as well.\n\nConsider this like an allowance. Keep up with your chores and you get a special treat."
"116521668-0-11610";"Well, good for you. But don't get too full of your accomplishments just yet. That was a fairly easy contract I started you with.\n\nCome back when you're ready for more. If the Speaker or the Matron give an order, though, that takes priority."
"116521668-0-11613";"Ever dream of the most perfect kill? Sometimes it keeps me up at night, imagining the best way to send a soul to Sithis. I thought I figured it out once. It came to me in a dream. But a dead chicken and a soup spoon make for terrible weapons."
"116521668-0-11617";"I spent a lovely evening listening to a Sermonizer in Kvatch. He went on and on about how terrible the Dark Brotherhood is. I found it quite amusing. And so did he when I stuck an ice pick in his ear.\n\nSpeaking of perfect kills, here's your payment."
"116521668-0-11623";"It seems your work was far from perfect, but a life is a life.\n\nReturn tomorrow. The truest path to improvement is practice, and the Night Mother provides ample opportunity for that."
"116521668-0-11624";"Excellent. The Night Mother will be pleased.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I am eager to see you reach your full potential."
"116521668-0-11625";"Exemplary work. You truly possess the gift of death.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I'm certain we can find more ways to put your skills to the test."
"116521668-0-11633";"It seems your work was far from perfect, but a life is a life.\n\nReturn tomorrow. The truest path to improvement is practice, and the Night Mother provides ample opportunity for that."
"116521668-0-11634";"Excellent. The Night Mother will be pleased.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I am eager to see you reach your full potential."
"116521668-0-11635";"Exemplary work. You truly have a gift for death.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I'm certain we can find more ways to put your skills to the test."
"116521668-0-11676";"Sithis welcomes all souls to the Void, no matter how they arrive. You have executed your duty, but I expect more from you.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I'll offer you a chance to prove that you can excel, not just kill."
"116521668-0-11677";"Another soul delivered to Sithis. It's unfortunate that things did not go wholly as planned, but the end result is the same.\n\nReflect on what occurred. Return tomorrow and use what you have learned."
"116521668-0-11678";"Performed with all the care befitting the Night Mother's sacred work. Your devotion to this task has not been overlooked.\n\nReturn again tomorrow and I will offer you another opportunity to demonstrate your skill."
"116521668-0-11686";"Sithis welcomes all souls to the Void, no matter how they might arrive. You executed your duty, but I expect more of you.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I'll offer you a chance to prove you can excel as well as kill."
"116521668-0-11687";"Another soul delivered to Sithis. It's unfortunate that things did not go wholly as planned, but the end result is the same.\n\nReflect on all that occurred. Then return tomorrow to use what you have learned."
"116521668-0-11688";"Performed with all the care befitting the Night Mother's sacred work. Your devotion to this task has not been overlooked.\n\nReturn again tomorrow and I'll offer you another opportunity to demonstrate your skill."
"116521668-0-11696";"Sithis welcomes all souls to the Void, no matter how they arrive. You have executed your duty, but I expect more of you.\n\nReturn tomorrow. I'll provide a chance to prove you can excel as well as kill."
"116521668-0-11697";"Another soul delivered to Sithis. It's unfortunate that things did not go wholly as planned, but the end result is the same.\n\nReflect on what occurred. Return tomorrow to use what you have learned."
"116521668-0-11698";"Performed with all the care befitting the Night Mother's sacred work. Your devotion to this task has not been overlooked.\n\nReturn again tomorrow and I'll provide another opportunity to prove your prowess."
"116521668-0-11736";"Hmm. You return head bowed? Do not be troubled by your failure to complete my challenges. You killed the target. That is enough for the Night Mother, and enough for me.\n\nPerhaps tomorrow you can finally impress me."
"116521668-0-11737";"A soul has been sent to the Void. Pity that you weren't able to complete both of my challenges, but there's no sense dwelling on your failures.\n\nHere's your reward. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11738";"Expertly done. I sense that some of your Brothers and Sisters gaze upon you with jealous eyes. This is good. Perhaps that will motivate them to excel.\n\nTake this with the Night Mother's blessing. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11746";"Hmm. You return head bowed? Do not be troubled by your failure to complete my challenges. You killed the target. That is enough for the Night Mother, and enough for me.\n\nPerhaps tomorrow you can show me your true quality."
"116521668-0-11747";"A soul has been sent to the Void. Pity that you weren't able to complete both of my challenges, but there's no sense dwelling on your failures.\n\nHere's your reward. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11748";"Expertly done. I sense that some of our Brothers and Sisters gaze upon you with jealous eyes. This is good. Perhaps that will motivate them to excel.\n\nTake this with the Night Mother's blessing. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11756";"Hmm. You return head bowed? Do not be troubled by your failure to complete my challenges. You killed the target. That is enough for the Night Mother, and enough for me.\n\nPerhaps tomorrow you can finally impress me."
"116521668-0-11757";"A soul has been sent to the Void. Pity that you weren't able to complete both of my challenges, but there's no sense dwelling on your failures.\n\nHere's your reward. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11758";"Expertly done. I sense that some of our Brothers and Sisters gaze upon you with jealous eyes. This is good. Perhaps that will motivate them to excel.\n\nTake this with the Night Mother's blessing. Return tomorrow. There is always work to be done."
"116521668-0-11826";"Did your eyes start bleeding recently? You didn't cough up any beetles, did you? Good, good … sounds like you avoided the curse.\n\nProbably."
"116521668-0-11832";"So the <<z:1>> are in place? One of my clan mothers gets a cut for every one we use, so she'll be happy to hear it.\n\nAnd the locals around Shael Ruins, I suppose."
"116521668-0-11836";"Good. The local bumpkins can return to calling it ""Grandmother's Respite,"" or whatever fool name they used to give it.\n\nUntil the <<mz:1>> fail. And when they do, I'll have more work for you."
"116521668-0-11838";"Well, isn't that an impressive bag full of junk. It's amazing what people are willing to pay for trash these days.\n\nBut those Dark Elf siblings pay well. Here's your share."
"116521668-0-11841";"Impressive. These are all fit for display—once I scrub the dirt off. Filthy cultists don't know culture when they see it.\n\nHere, you earned this."
"116521668-0-11842";"Good—the Red Rooks are ticks. I go out of my way to squash them. Or have someone else squash them.\n\nI'll get these heirlooms back where they belong. Here, you earned it."
"116521668-0-11851";"What happens now? I utter a prayer to Sithis and send this traitor down dead-man's river. If I had the time, I'd do something really spectacular, but I can hear the spiders closing in. A bolt in the head will have to do.\n\nAgain, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-11862";"You came this far, did you not? Drink from the cauldron. Feel the witchmother's brew course through you!\n\nDo not delay, reaper. The harvest lasts only so long."
"116521668-0-11864";"The battle against the Scaled Court will continue, but this was the one place in Craglorn the Serpent could be contained. You accomplished wonders today.\n\nTuruk wanted me to give this to you. Don't worry—it's not diseased. I think."
"116521668-0-11866";"You are five-clawed, my friend. Milksop no longer, though it will not stop this one from naming you ""Milksop.""\n\nIt seems none among the captured live. A shame, but Turuk will think of them when he sheathes his sword with the belly of a beast."
"116521668-0-11867";"Well. I suppose we could wait for reinforcements. Mordra and Kailstig are out there. Somewhere. Or we could call the Fighter's Guild.\n\nThis is embarassing."
"116521668-0-11871";"And you didn't burn a part of yourself off in the process. I'd call that a success.\n\nWell done!"
"116521668-0-11873";"Restored the Apex Stone? Incredible! Then my predictions were more accurate than I expected and you've done more than I could have asked. \n\nI'll keep the amulet safe here among the Star-Gazers for now. There may be more we can learn from it."
"116521668-0-11874";"Gather allies before you leave the city. You'll need loyal friends to face the armies of the Warrior, the Mage, and the Serpent.\n\nReturn to me each time you learn something new. I will use what you learn to devise a plan to defeat the Celestials."
"116521668-0-11875";"See that Titus makes it to Belkarth. The Star-Gazers will give him refuge. I feel he may still have a part to play in our struggle.\n\nContinue to work with Hara of the Star-Gazers. I will reach out to you again when it is safe to do so."
"116521668-0-11876";"I will continue my quest to find relics for my master and acquire the knowledge to defeat the Celestials.\n\nYou might do the same. If you find curious relics from Craglorn's lost history, bring them here and Hermaeus Mora will reward you."
"116521668-0-11877";"What mad sorcery. Better that she's gone and the water cleansed.\n\nThank you for this. Maybe this will give us a chance to do proper research and find out what really happened to this city."
"116521668-0-11878";"At last. Although it does not end the suffering of my fellow Sword-Disciples, at least the Serpent's foul poison will spread no more.\n\nFor my part, I will wait here until it is safe to enter, bury the dead, and see if I can carry on their legacy."
"116521668-0-11883";"I know. But still, it's so terrible. Whatever the source of this curse, you must find a way to end it.\n\nI will take Nahlia back to the main camp. Thank you for helping us."
"116521668-0-11885";"I suspect it will be a long time before the people of Elinhir trust mages again—and with good reason. The city is in ruins and it's our fault.\n\nI'll seal off the mage towers and help rebuild the city. If they'll let me, that is."
"116521668-0-11887";"I hope not, but we can never be too cautious. \n\nIn the meantime, I will take samples of the staff to the Mages Guild for study."
"116521668-0-11888";"I find this offering to be acceptable. Inside the gem, you can see the celestial bodies in their courses.\n\nThe text says the constellations are gods. They can be brought to earth using stones carved from Aetherium. Make of that what you will."
"116521668-0-11889";"The Dwemer knew things you cannot even dream.\n\nHere is your reward: the Celestials are bound to this realm by their Apex stones. These stones were constructed using knowledge stolen from the Dwemer. To defeat the Celestials, you must find the stones."
"116521668-0-11890";"A death, and an unrequited love. Sentimental, and unimportant. \n\nBut you have fulfilled your part of the bargain, so here is mine: there is a man who can help you defeat the Anka-Ra. His name is Titus Valerius, but he is not of this time."
"116521668-0-11891";"We've sent the Serpent reeling, but he will strike again.\n\nWe need to use this time to prepare our forces and free the Mage and the Warrior. The Serpent can only be defeated through the combined efforts of all three guardians."
"116521668-0-11892";"Listen. I know I've been a spineless lout, but I'm grateful for this. When we summoned those atronachs, we never imagined they'd be turned against Craglorn.\n\nIf I can ever repay the favor, let me know."
"116521668-0-11893";"""Speculations on a Cure for the Dreadful Corruption, Imposed by Shada on the City of Water, on the Eve of the Invasion of Tarish-Zi""?\n\nThis is Nedic! How did you? No, I don't care. This may be just what we need to help the afflicted. Many thanks!"
"116521668-0-11899";"Wait … they were telling the truth? I guess it makes sense. They did all look and talk the same.\n\nI must inform the Star-Gazers of this development. The tides may finally be turning in our favor!"
"116521668-0-11907";"And you look perfectly healthy. How … irksome. I suppose my wayward acolytes weren't as powerful as I thought. I'll need to be more diligent in my training of their replacements.\n\nStill, my lord Satakal thanks you. May his coils guide your steps."
"116521668-0-11908";"Fed them to … but why would …. Those scaleless savages! I swear on the Hist, we'll sun ourselves with vengeance before we depart!\n\nThank you for trying to save them. And for bringing us their badges. Their families will appreciate the gesture."
"116521668-0-11909";"The little goat honors the stones with Agganor's blood! I will see the Scaled Court destroyed as well, this Lashburr swears.\n\nLittle goat, it has my thanks. Steel for its enemies, blood for its tribe."
"116521668-0-11910";"Exarch Arnoth? I've heard his name whispered in fear, even among the Scaled Court. If you killed him, you've dealt a far greater blow to the Serpent's cult than you can imagine. \n\nPerhaps now we'll be able to learn more about the nirncrux element."
"116521668-0-11913";"Thank you for helping me in this matter.\n\nNow, I need to make sure these spawning pools can't be used again. And I should collect a few of the mantikora remains. I need to study them so I can continue to oppose the Serpent's horrid plans."
"116521668-0-11914";"Right. Of course. \n\nCassi asked me to bring some of the altered nirncrux to her. So she can study it. I'll stay here and collect what I need. But thanks. I couldn't have completed my mission without you!"
"116521668-0-11916";"Arkay bless you, for the living will rest easier now that Virmaril is gone. But I sense … something.\n\nI will remain here. Where necromancy is concerned, who can say what is possible? If Virmaril rises again, someone will need to take action."
"116521668-0-11918";"And so we did. Cassipia and Little Leaf's deaths were regrettable, but they were a necessary evil in our efforts to save Craglorn.\n\nYou have provided another great service to the Guardian Celestials. For that, you have my gratitude."
"116521668-0-11919";"Of course! And I will do what I can to dissuade others from entering this portion of the city again.\n\nPerhaps some day we can seal the ruins completely, as the Yokudans tried to do. For now, be content that the wards have bought us time."
"116521668-0-11921";"Cassi sent you? Well, why didn't you say so? I'm so lucky that the regent looks out for me!\n\nAll right. We've got a lot of work to do. Have you ever tried to change an Iron Orc's mind? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!"
"116521668-0-11922";"Little Leaf sent you? Then I assume all is well with my dearest companion?\n\nSince you did as my Little Leaf asked, I can only hope you shall grant me the same courtesy."
"116521668-0-11924";"This is a magnificent blade! I can feel its energy. It calls to me, just as the Warrior once did.\n\nIt feels right. As though I was meant to have it. Well then, in friendship, I hope you will accept my old blade. Something to remember me by."
"116521668-0-11927";"<The latch opens a door in the menhir, revealing a vault. Inside the vault, you find an ancient Nedic coffer. It appears to be unaffected by age and cool to the touch. This must be your reward for completing the Gray Passage in the allotted time.>"
"116521668-0-11934";"Good. I'll get these back to their owners and let them know the tribe in Atanaz Ruins won't cause them any more trouble.\n\nIf they do? I'll send you to cause trouble right back."
"116521668-0-11936";"That's good. Don't know what's inside and I don't really care. All I know is that the client is willing to pay.\n\nHere, you earned it."
"116521668-0-11937";"I don't know. Killing some coward assassins doesn't sound impressive to me. I suppose you killed a lot of them.\n\nFine. Your key and your cut. Tomorrow we'll find an enemy brave enough to face you head on."
"116521668-0-11938";"Hah! Spit in Mephala's face and crushed her greatest minion like a bug! I could kiss you if you weren't covered in Daedra spittle.\n\nMaybe I'll make it up to you tomorrow. Until then, settle for your key and cut."
"116521668-0-11939";"Hmph, did they call it the Cradle of Shadows because it was full of suckling babes? Ridding the world of spider-worshipers is always worth something.\n\nKey. Cut. And shake off those webs before you find a bed."
"116521668-0-11954";"And nothing from the Lion Guard, which doesn't surprise me. Wayrest politics is all about displaying wounds that were self-inflicted. If the Lion Guard complains about their missed opportunity, I'll send them a mallet."
"116521668-0-11955";"Doesn't look like a bloodfiend gnawed off any of your limbs. Even better, you weren't hopelessly lost in the mountains. That's victory in my book."
"116521668-0-11956";"Yes, the chapter already sent its regards for your work. Should they need additional aid, they've requested I send you their way."
"116521668-0-11957";"I used to spar with legionaries before the war. They were fearsome enough in a practice ring. I hope they didn't cause you any trouble in Bangkorai."
"116521668-0-11958";"Good. I've already told the Stonefalls chapter to increase their patrols. If the Worm Cult gets a foothold, volcanic activity will be the least of their problems."
"116521668-0-11959";"I heard. I already received a dozen letters from the temple in Mournhold, each protesting Fighters Guild involvement in their affairs. I thanked them for restocking the latrine.\n\nNo response yet."
"116521668-0-11960";"So the treeminders were right. Over the years I've learned to trust their dreams. Must be all the time I spent with Sees-All-Colors."
"116521668-0-11961";"Yes, the Eastmarch chapter said your name would be carved into the halls of Sovngarde.\n\nBut they didn't send gold. Your deeds are good enough to commemorate for all time, yet they left me to pay the reward. Typical for the Eastmarch chapter."
"116521668-0-11962";"Excellent. It's not often I thank the Eight for the wounded pride of a jarl, but I won't complain if it keeps Worm Cult plots in check."
"116521668-0-11963";"I heard. The Auridon chapter has received dozens of complaints for ""jamming our noses in High Elf affairs.""\n\nThat's what they call a Summerset thank you. Good work."
"116521668-0-11964";"<<1>> will be happy to hear we've jammed a thumb in the eye of Molag Bal. If we're lucky, he'll throw us a feast."
"116521668-0-11965";"Good. I'll make certain the Malabal Tor chapter learns of your aid. We can't afford to let trivial concerns distract us from our goal."
"116521668-0-11966";"The spinner's warning was real, then? I bet the hall steward he'd ingested one too many Valenwood mushrooms. Good for Tamriel, but bad for my coin purse."
"116521668-0-11967";"As bad as reported, then? Must be all the turmoil around that Khajiit leader of theirs. The Worm Cult takes every advantage of instability."
"116521668-0-11969";"Ha! You really showed those Daedra. They'll think twice about coming back to Tamriel.\n\nOr they won't, and we'll teach them again."
"116521668-0-11971";"Truly, I couldn't have done this without you and Eoki. A plan is only as useful as the people who carry it out. You have my deepest thanks, sera.\n\nNow … I suppose it's time!"
"116521668-0-11975";"Good. That should be enough to break the curse.\n\nBut if your teeth fall out and you start to vomit bile, you should stop by your local Mages Guild. As a precaution, you understand."
"116521668-0-11984";"Ha! That burning incense twists their smallclothes something fierce—if they had any left.\n\nDon't know why, don't care. But I'm glad they spent their last moments in extreme frustration."
"116521668-0-11986";"Listen well and speak not a word! My divine energy, it drains away. Whether from illness or foul malady, I know not. You must travel the land and seek answers on my behalf.\n\nBut first, ""Gratitude before service,"" as I have written. So, thank you."
"116521668-0-11989";"Did she? And where is this writ? I don't see any writ. And without a writ, all I have is a murder.\n\nTake your strongbox, but we'll hold onto you until I have proof of your claim. I have no patience for tale-tellers or slavers."
"116521668-0-11996";"I know. I can smell it on your breath from here.\n\nImpressive. Less impressive than when I walloped a whole camp of bandits with their own stew pot and ladle … after drinking all their ale. Still, impressive enough for a reward."
"116521668-0-12007";"I see that! You have a glow about you. <<1>> celebrates this way to show they don't fear what the cold brings. At the end of a winter's journey is a warm fire, good mead, and wonderful company.\n\nAlso, it lets them compare tattoos!"
"116521668-0-12011";"Unnerving. How many people were clad in this garment? Why does an ancient, mad king wish to speak through them? Worse, how many would follow?\n\nAlways more questions than answers. Perhaps that's the lure of the Mad God."
"116521668-0-12017";"The <<1>> was designed to protect caretakers, yet it puts them in even greater danger from their inmate's rage. Such a morbid object."
"116521668-0-12019";"Abhorrent. I rarely question the Order's commitment. It is essential to prepare for dangers from the Shivering Isles.\n\nStill … some tools of the Daedra are best thrown onto a pyre."
"116521668-0-12021";"How utterly pedestrian. There is nothing special about this—nothing at all. To think, something so ordinary could draw forth dark seducers and golden saints from a wheel of eidar cheese.\n\nOr it's just a cheese knife."
"116521668-0-12023";"Merciful Divines! It's so horrid in person. To think, this can drive a person to euphoric heights or wretched depths—depending on which face is worn.\n\nYou may want to wash your hands. Perhaps visit a temple."
"116521668-0-12027";"How innocuous. A poorly crafted instrument to most, but the mad few will hear perfectly tuned notes. The more one hears it play, the better it sounds."
"116521668-0-12029";"Hideous. Stories say this creature was born to one of Sheogorath's favored mortals. Its second face whispered dark secrets and terrible prophecies to those touched by the Mad God.\n\nPerhaps it's best the poor soul did not survive to adulthood."
"116521668-0-12031";"Absolutely tasteless. I mean the very concept, not the <<1>> itself. I have no idea how it tastes. Er, nor will I. Ever.\n\nWhat I mean to say is the Order thanks you for your valiant efforts."
"116521668-0-12034";"Peculiar. Shivering Isles residents are said to drink the stuff because it reveals secret truths to them.\n\nThe Order will research its function as a ""madness curative,"" something best to have at hand when dealing with the Mad God."
"116521668-0-12036";"You didn't open the cage, did you? Regardless of what it told you? The Order was quite adamant.\n\nThough I suppose if you had, you wouldn't be standing here. Never mind—job well done."
"116521668-0-12037";"So unassuming. The simplest relics can hold great power within. If the Order is right, this button was once worn by the Mad God himself.\n\nAnd if not, it will end up in a jar with a hundred others like it."
"116521668-0-12040";"Troubling. The Order believes there are hidden patterns among the recipes and cheese-related observations.\n\nAs for me, I prefer the simplicity of rice and fish."
"116521668-0-12042";"Curious. This doesn't seem so strange at all. It's almost … comforting to look at.\n\nRight, can't let my guard down. I'll have it crated up immediately."
"116521668-0-12044";"Fascinating. Perhaps absolute truth is too much for mortal minds.\n\nOr perhaps they were simply too tight for the old sage. Poorly-fitted spectacles would drive me mad."
"116521668-0-12046";"Absolutely terrifying. To think, <<Ac:1>> was found among rogue soldiers. What a terrible thing to confuse for a canteen."
"116521668-0-12048";"You've proven to be a reliable assistant. House Hlaalu values reliability. I would say it's been a pleasure, but this whole affair has left me with quite a headache. Still, I may call upon you again in the future.\n\nHere. Double pay, as promised."
"116521668-0-12049";"Then our Glenumbra chapter can breathe easier. The turmoil in their region will keep them busy for quite some time. Best the Worm Cult isn't a part of that turmoil."
"116521668-0-12053";"What did <<1>> ask you to do? Retrieve the coins from the chest, or from the victor's purse?\n\nNo, don't tell me—I'll ask her when she visits."
"116521668-0-12054";"No need to fear on that account. I have just the spell to assure Stromgruf's total cooperation for the rest of the trip to Vivec City. My clients need their potions, after all.\n\nThank you again for your assistance. I really do appreciate good help!"
"116521668-0-12055";"You sound just like Mother. Well, both of you are going to see how wrong you are.\n\nNothing can keep us apart now!"
"116521668-0-12056";"I'll need it. You didn't ask for anything, but I want you to have this. Just the gold I managed to hide away over the years, minus what I'll need for passage.\n\nNot payment, a gift. For a friend. Goodbye … and thank you, so much."
"116521668-0-12058";"So you brought some much needed joy into the dour lands of Stonefalls? This is why the Lava Foot Stomp occurs each year. At least for a time, the warm feeling comes from within—and not all the nearby volcanoes."
"116521668-0-12060";"So you brought some much needed joy into the dour lands of Stonefalls? This is why the Lava Foot Stomp occurs each year. At least for a time, the warm feeling comes from within—and not all the nearby volcanoes."
"116521668-0-12061";"Wonderful! Mud on the face reminds us that life is not always so self-important. With New Life comes a bit of fun, for those who aren't too proud to take part."
"116521668-0-12067";"What a relief. With Mistress Dratha's approval, I'll send runners to nearby towns and let the people know it's safe to return. Thank you, my friend. Truly.\n\nTake this. And I believe my Mistress Dratha would like a proper word as well."
"116521668-0-12068";"That would be your opinion, wouldn't it? My path is clear. A Daedric pact may seem a grim choice, but I'm prepared for the consequences.\n\nNow, you adventurers love trinkets and gold, yes? I trust this will suffice. Farewell."
"116521668-0-12069";"Ah, Zoreh's tale is a lovely one. <<1>>'s celebration honors the sacrifices we must sometimes make, so that others may enjoy a new dawn.\n\nA toast to your swift legs!"
"116521668-0-12076";"Then you know its importance to Alcaire Castle. Imagine a castle recovering from a terribly bloody war. Parents lost, siblings scarred, children buried.\n\nAfter such tragedy, they celebrate the New Life as a chance to laugh and wonder once more."
"116521668-0-12088";"Good. War destroys what it touches, especially a family. The High Elves of <<1>> see their celebration as necessary to restore the spirit and renew the hope of lost children. \n\nAnd they hope that one day, they will never have the need to celebrate."
"116521668-0-12090";"Then you truly understand the War Orphan's Sojourn. The children have lost everything. Providing what you can, and then even more, gives them New Life in a new year.\n\nIt is not easy. But it eases their burden, which is all they know."
"116521668-0-12091";"Should have told you to pack these in salt. I need to get these to the locals before they completely rot. They were very specific.\n\nYou earned your pay. Consider spending it on soap and a long bath."
"116521668-0-12097";"The Fish Boon Feast reminds us that it warms the heart to fill a hungry belly, especially when it isn't your own.\n\nAnd if you're truly in need? Well … the smallest kindness of others can help you survive and thrive."
"116521668-0-12099";"Good food, good drink, and good times are the heart of Betnikh's celebration of the New Life. I'm glad <<1>> could show you herself.\n\nI do miss the adventures we had in our younger days. I'd tell stories, but I don't want to burn your ears off."
"116521668-0-12100";"He's dead? Damn. At least he died knowing you'd rescued this lot. I'll keep smuggling slaves out of Vvardenfell, sure. And I'll make sure they know why, too.\n\nTake this. Khartag would want you to have it. Good luck on the road, friend."
"116521668-0-12104";"Good food, good drink, and good times are the heart of Betnikh's celebration of the New Life. I'm glad <<1>> could show you herself.\n\nI do miss the adventures we had in our younger days. I'd tell stories, but I don't want to burn your ears off."
"116521668-0-12112";"Well, that makes two of us! I took no pleasure in spending all that coin, but as a retainer, I'll be able to double that sum before long.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have a writ to deliver! Thank you again, my friend."
"116521668-0-12134";"Yes. But I do so knowing that the legacy of the Scarlet Judge is in good hands.\n\nWe Dark Elves are beset on all sides by greed and scheming malice. I fought it all my life, but now it falls to you. Keep up the work, and be the hero Vvardenfell needs."
"116521668-0-12135";"If Galgalah is truly banished, he won't torment anyone else again. Farwen must have known that.\n\nHere's your payment. You did everything I could have asked for, so thank you for that. I'm going to find Sharz after this and give him the news."
"116521668-0-12137";"That's good news indeed! You must understand that discretion is paramount here. No need for word to get around of our little mishap. You keep quiet, and I'll see that more work comes your way."
"116521668-0-12138";"Thank goodness. Luring cats to his door everyday would have gotten awfully tiresome.\n\nIn the end he'll see it's for the best. Collaboration always yields better results than competition. You and I are proof of that, right? Thanks again, sera."
"116521668-0-12140";"Thank you, friend! You've done me, nay, the world, a huge favor today. I already know that the breakthroughs I'll make with these specimens will be talked about across the ages.\n\nAnd I'll of course make sure to credit you in my dissertation."
"116521668-0-12143";"Wiping a thousand years of smugness off the Kinlord's face in front of his servants is reward in its own right, but I've got something more tangible for you. Take this and claim your prize!\n\nTomorrow we'll find a way to make good use of it!"
"116521668-0-12152";"For Undaunted who leave no stone unturned, no challenge unanswered, no foe unbutchered? Only the best is due! Take your cut and return tomorrow. I will find you another worthy challenge."
"116521668-0-12157";"It's only because of you, friend. I'll raise a bottle of mead to you every night, from now until World's End.\n\nPlease, take this. You've more than earned it for what you've done."
"116521668-0-12166";"You'll have more than a few battered cogs to show for your effort today. Take your key and your cut. Tomorrow we'll find you something equally as fun to break!"
"116521668-0-12167";"Dipping your toes into Oblivion would merit some respect, but bringing home a souvenir Daedra head more than earns your cut.\n\nTake your prize and I'll see if I can't send you through the gates again tomorrow!"
"116521668-0-12168";"You have sundered the twins and the chains they held upon the dead. What reward can compare to the world set right? I do not know. Perhaps this will suffice.\n\nTake what's yours and return to me tomorrow to set right the world again."
"116521668-0-12169";"I would be remiss not to reward one who walks boldly through flames to face their foe. You have left Razor Master Erthas as broken as brittle brambles.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Quench your hot blood tonight, for tomorrow the world may burn."
"116521668-0-12170";"You pried open the jaws of death and tempted it with your bare throat. For sending the lamia queen to her grave without the taste of your blood on her scaly lips, you are deserving of the name Undaunted.\n\nTake your reward. Tomorrow we begin again."
"116521668-0-12171";"You are owed more than respect. Being the first to set foot in the ancient earth takes mettle. To survive its unknown dangers takes skill. You have both.\n\nAdd your key and your cut to your new found treasures. Tomorrow you may face uncertainty again."
"116521668-0-12172";"Take it, and remember to return tomorrow. The bards have been asking for someone to sing about, and I know your exploits will be fitting for a new tale."
"116521668-0-12174";"Undaunted seek glory and treasure. Good deeds are not chief among our concerns. You have managed to find room for both today. It is to be commended.\n\nTake your key and cut. The dead rest now, as you should. A new day approaches. It may be your last."
"116521668-0-12176";"Cultists are some of the peskiest vermin to be rid of. Your cut will reflect that.\n\nTake your key and return tomorrow! We'll find you something more exciting than clearing cobwebs."
"116521668-0-12177";"Right here, as always. You didn't think that I doubted you could best an empowered dwarven construct, did you? \n\nHave a seat at the fire and regale us with the tale of how you felled it, then tomorrow we'll find a new story to tell!"
"116521668-0-12178";"Take it, my friend. You do damned good work, and we are proud to count you among our number. Take your cut, and be sure to speak with me again tomorrow."
"116521668-0-12180";"Well this has been an ugly business, hasn't it? A talented breedsman dead, a brood exterminated, mercenaries slaughtered … sometimes I miss the academy.\n\nPlease, take this. House Hlaalu owes you a great debt. Safe travels, sera."
"116521668-0-12181";"Take your key and your cut. And come back tomorrow. Maybe next time you won't have to blast and cut your way through bloodthirsty undead to earn your prize!"
"116521668-0-12182";"Your key, Undaunted! Enjoy your cut. Air out your tunic, wash your hair, and be sure to see me again tomorrow."
"116521668-0-12184";"Home. The ritual of sacrifice is almost complete, and the Daedra Lords you so foolishly ignore will, we hope, spare us their wrath for another decade.\n\nWe will hope they turn their dire gaze upon Molag Mar before we return again."
"116521668-0-12188";"You are not one to let adversity chill the passion in your blood. The ice witch was no match.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Tomorrow I will stoke the fire in your veins once again."
"116521668-0-12189";"They are in the looks of admiration. The hearty cheers. And the chests in our camp. For casting down the Lava Queen and claiming her crown, you have earned the lion's share of all.\n\nTake your key and your cut. Tomorrow you may defend your throne."
"116521668-0-12193";"Hah! As if I would let your bounty get away from me that easy! Take your key and your cut! Tomorrow I'll have another song worthy battle awaiting you!"
"116521668-0-12194";"Of course! They're different all over. I've taken part in cliff jumping, anchor tossing, and even drunken echatere racing … though Orsinium had to cancel that one.\n\nSimply ask, and I'll send you to the best celebrations in Tamriel!"
"116521668-0-12195";"All yours, my friend. Come back tomorrow. Perhaps we'll send you to combat a vicious kitten rebellion! But then again … maybe not."
"116521668-0-12196";"Indeed, I must atone for doubting you. You took up the Frigid Tome and slew Valkyn Skoria without hesitation. The mark of true Undaunted.\n\nMay this key and your cut help you forgive any offense my undeserved skepticism might have caused."
"116521668-0-12197";"Now. When you have returned home the victor to the cheers of your cohorts. \n\nHold your prize high and show you are mightier than the storm. Enjoy it while you can, tomorrow the winds may not show you their favor."
"116521668-0-12199";"The legend of Captain Blackheart ends where yours begins. Sailors will murmur your name in awe and thanks. No less than I would expect from Undaunted.\n\nTake your rightful prize. Tomorrow we may continue to nurture your living myth."
"116521668-0-12201";"You have cut out the heart of the forest and bitten deep. Selene's Web is a bone yard. Nature trembles at your tread, Undaunted.\n\nYou've earned your key and your cut. Come to me tomorrow. I will find you another land to tame."
"116521668-0-12202";"I envy your fortitude. That is not a compliment I share with any other of our lot. I am Undaunted, but not unscarred. I hope you will remain the indomitable model of our peers.\n\nTake your due and hope that dawn is the only thing to break tomorrow."
"116521668-0-12204";"An Ashlander? That seems unlikely, but I trust your instincts. We need to find out more about this Chodala and the ancient enemy that aids him.\n\nTake this. Another token of my appreciation. And look, here comes the Archcanon now."
"116521668-0-12210";"Oh yes! Before you arrived, he was telling us all about it. I am certain it's going to make for a great story—his best yet! And he was so feisty!\n\nAllow me to pay you for your service. It is the standard rate for Narsis's apprentices."
"116521668-0-12211";"Here, take this. Without you, we'd still be dragging half-mad miners out of there.\n\nIt'll take some time to get the mine up and running, but with a new queen, I bet we'll be even more prosperous than before. Thanks, friend, and safe travels."
"116521668-0-12212";"Oh, a hundred blessings on you, walker! It is good to see that not everyone in Vvardenfell is an uptight prude.\n\nPlease, take this for your trouble."
"116521668-0-12213";"Halinjirr? I thought him a clueless sugar-sop. If he's managed to grow moon-sugar here in Vvardenfell, he's more cunning than he seems. Make no mistake, we'll find him.\n\nThe Tribunal thanks you for your help, outlander. Take this as your reward."
"116521668-0-12235";"Yes. ""In the shadow of Skar, we found our home."" There are few things more sacred than a dead hero's wish. I will see our home rebuilt—our tomb restored. I will honor my ancestors.\n\nHouse Hleran owes you a great debt, my friend. Thank you."
"116521668-0-12240";"Yes, of course. Never let it be said that Neramo doesn't compensate his assistants! Your aid proved invaluable.\n\nI trust this is adequate? Until we meet again, my friend."
"116521668-0-12241";"As you say. No other outsiders. But there are rules, outlander. I must do everything within reason to maintain the honor of House Redoran.\n\nHere. Your first payment. Soon, however, I'll expect more than just a verbal confirmation of Veya's safety."
"116521668-0-12243";"How this upstart Ashlander learned to attune Sotha Sil's tool confounds my understanding. And he dares use my power?\n\nStill, your help is appreciated. Every strike and parry takes us one step closer to ending this threat and restoring my vitality."
"116521668-0-12244";"That sounds like my Narsis! Always wanting to explore just one more nook and cranny! I assume he'll be along shortly for one of my shoulder rubs.\n\nAllow me to pay you for your service. It is the standard rate for Narsis's apprentices."
"116521668-0-12247";"Kyne choke this place in weeds for eternity. I'll hear that hammer in my nightmares for the rest of my days ….\n\nWe've been left with nothing to offer you other than our thanks, but you're welcome to all of it."
"116521668-0-12251";"This was not your fight, but you chose to take it up when things were most hopeless, and turned our darkest hour into a victory. If that isn't the work of the Divines, I don't know what is."
"116521668-0-12254";"That was simply a consequence. They needed Tribunal energy to locate the Clockwork City … I was the easiest target. If Barbas enters Sotha Sil's city … disaster will follow.\n\nI appreciate your help, but I must conserve what remains of my energy."
"116521668-0-12257";"Hmm? Oh, yes. With this machine shutdown the threat to Tel Fyr is contained. Keep whatever valuables you collected as compensation."
"116521668-0-12258";"Hmm? Oh, yes. With this machine shutdown the threat to Tel Fyr is contained. Consider these treasures reward for your assistance."
"116521668-0-12259";"Hmm? Oh, yes. With this machine shutdown the threat to Tel Fyr is contained. \n\nTake this as thanks. I could not have asked for more capable assistants in this endeavor."
"116521668-0-12260";"You sniveling little s'wit. Do you know how valuable—? Never mind. What's done is done. But don't expect any extra coin from me now. You'll have what was promised for killing Malur and not a drake more.\n\nThis had better buy your silence as well."
"116521668-0-12262";"This doesn't look particularly illuminating, but I'll add it to my research collection.\n\nShould you find something else interesting in your travels, do think of me."
"116521668-0-12263";"Yes, this could have potential. You're not trying to butter me up for any reason in particular, are you? No matter.\n\nTake this as recompense."
"116521668-0-12264";"Now this is a find. It's clear you intend to curry my favor, and I'll admit it—it's working. I have something you should find equally interesting. Consider it a fair exchange."
"116521668-0-12266";"Good! Hope it didn't cause you too much trouble on the way here.\n\nI'll find a good home for the little thing. One that doesn't involve a skooma peddler's belly."
"116521668-0-12288";"That wasn't Nevena. She died here. You fulfilled her last wishes. I don't know that I could have done it, even without the gut wound.\n\nThank you for bringing her peace."
"116521668-0-12293";"Arith assures me that the Council will accept my petition now. So yes, I'd call this a success. Hopefully, no one will give me cause to do this again in the future.\n\nOnce again, you have my thanks, sera."
"116521668-0-12294";"I did. But only because you wouldn't have done it otherwise. Ralasa would have killed Eoki and me eventually. She forced my hand. A Telvanni must act or die.\n\nPlease, take this and my apologies. I hope you'll see the wisdom in this eventually."
"116521668-0-12295";"As Lord Vivec has written, ""The bravest heart never falters."" You are truly Vivec's champion.\n\nI didn't know if the Blessing Stone was going to work, but I appreciate your help. Now go and talk to Lord Vivec. I'm sure he has a plan to share with us."
"116521668-0-12296";"I'm almost afraid to do so. What couldn't he just say to us all this time?\n\nStill, these were his last wishes. Thank you for making that possible."
"116521668-0-12299";"Oh, well, that's another matter entirely. Why didn't you just say so? So much to do, I need to prepare for the journey!\n\nAh, here's your pay. Goodbye."
"116521668-0-12300";"As my next sermon shall proclaim, ""Modesty is the false cloak of a flatterer or the sincere garment of the humble.""\n\nAgain, you have my gratitude and that of all my people. Indeed, even those who rail against the Tribunal owe you their lives."
"116521668-0-12302";"Finally, a competent worker! You'd be surprised how difficult those are to come by these days. You should sleep better knowing that creature won't be ruining anymore careers. And I'm sure the extra gold in your pocket doesn't hurt either."
"116521668-0-12304";"An impressive trophy from a worthy hunt! I'm beginning to forget you're an outlander.\n\nAllow me to honor you, in turn, with this humble reward."
"116521668-0-12305";"You follow the path and honor the hunt. Continue this course and you'll always find a place at our fires, outlander.\n\nFor now, take this as a token of our mutual respect."
"116521668-0-12308";"A trophy from a greater hive golem? Impressive. A word of advice, though. The stink of fetcherflies clings to you like a tangled shawl. Soak in a hot spring and eliminate that scent before you hunt again.\n\nHere's your reward."
"116521668-0-12309";"Excellent! The tribe will eat well tonight and praise your hunting prowess with every delicious morsel.\n\nSuch effort does not go unrewarded. Take this, with our compliments."
"116521668-0-12310";"It's unusual for an outsider to seek to honor our customs and follow our traditions. Continue on this path and never show weakness, and you will always be welcome among the Erabenimsun.\n\nAccept this as a token of our mutual respect."
"116521668-0-12311";"Old Stomper falls and my people rejoice. Most impressive, hunter. You show your respect for our tribe and this land with every hunt you complete. Perhaps you have Ashlander blood flowing through you, after all.\n\nTake this with our thanks."
"116521668-0-12312";"A King Razor-Tusk trophy serves as a great talisman for hunters about to set off into the wild. Our crafters will make good use of this specimen.\n\nAnd for you, this gift. As is our custom when a hunter successfully returns to camp."
"116521668-0-12314";"Sage advice. I've had my fill of schemes for now. I plan to dedicate myself to my studies and try to patch things up with Eoki. The last time I saw him, I said some … hurtful things.\n\nAgain, thank you. Next time you're in Sadrith Mora, come visit."
"116521668-0-12315";"Thank you, outlander. Hopefully I can sell these items for a fair price to some scholars within the city. Not that I'm too worried about haggling, mind you. I've been at this for a long time.\n\nKeep the ash from your eyes."
"116521668-0-12320";"I'm grateful that we were able to solve this through peaceful measures. I'll start my research on his notes straight away. I'm sure to find some clue about how he came about this knowledge in the first place."
"116521668-0-12324";"You—you actually did it? You defeated the Hunger? I'll be honest, I didn't expect that. Thank you for the help! We'll be sure to contact you if any other horrifyingly grotesque creatures show up.\n\nMaybe I should start saving up for that bakery."
"116521668-0-12330";"Tell my daughter I'm sorry. Tell her she needs to stay away until I can calm things down. I don't want to see anything happen to her. Promise me.\n\nAnd take this. Consider it payment for your efforts thus far."
"116521668-0-12335";"This note, along with the other evidence you uncovered, clearly implicates the Governor as working with the slavers. Well done!\n\nYou have provided a great service to Seyda Neen. I'll take it from here."
"116521668-0-12336";"Delightful! It's so much nicer to rule a kingdom of happy subjects, don't you think?\n\nWell, I'm just exhausted from all this dreadful ruling."
"116521668-0-12339";"Nothing yet! I need to catalog them, study the ancient script, and make suitable translations. But given time, the Great Houses will see the value in this project and reward our efforts accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, take this with my gratitude."
"116521668-0-12342";"I suppose I did, but it brings me no joy. Little wonder that other members of my House do the wrong thing so often.\n\nThank you for all you've done, sera. I will never forget your loyalty and friendship."
"116521668-0-12343";"Yes. Eoki may curse me, but he'll see the wisdom in this eventually. I'll sweep his role in the escape under the rug—keep him safe from reprisals. One day, he'll thank me.\n\nI appreciate your help in all of this, sera. You're a true friend."
"116521668-0-12344";"Thanks to you, the worship of Mehrunes Dagon shall be preserved for future generations, when all Dark Elves willingly return to the true faith.\n\nThis small reward is inconsequential compared to the service you have provided, outlander."
"116521668-0-12345";"Well done.\n\nHow easily our people forget the past. How eager they are to bury it in the endless ash. We never forget. We never forgive. Now take this, with our thanks."
"116521668-0-12346";"You have done my tribe and all our people a great service, outlander. One day, these relics shall be returned and the Daedric shrines will be opened. One day.\n\nIn the meantime, take this humble reward with our thanks."
"116521668-0-12347";"It pains me to see our brethren fall, but they brought this fate upon themselves.\n\nThank you. I will see these relics placed under the care of our Wise Woman."
"116521668-0-12348";"Pieces of history once thought lost are found again. Thank you.\n\nAnd for you, please accept this humble reward."
"116521668-0-12349";"Every piece of history tells a part of the story. Thank you for retrieving these. I will have the taint of the vampires removed from them as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your help, outlander. Take this in gratitude for your efforts."
"116521668-0-12350";"You saved these relics from dark cultists. We shall purify them and preserve them for future generations, thanks to you.\n\nAccept this humble token as a symbol of our gratitude."
"116521668-0-12352";"This note clearly implicates the governor. Along with the other evidence you uncovered, it's obvious that he was working with the slavers. Well done!\n\nSeyda Neen owes you for this great service, but I'll take it from here."
"116521668-0-12353";"Ah! She is tasteful, is she not? I could just eat her up! Much better.\n\nYour heroics have stirred my spirits! Haha! I must savor these tenderous moments. Rare as they are."
"116521668-0-12365";"Brivan was Ulran's best friend. Would he really betray my brother?\n\nRegardless, I want you to have this. You could have handed me to my father and you didn't. Other than Naryu and Ashur, you might be the only friend I have left."
"116521668-0-12375";"Oh, thank the Three. If I had to tell the Temple we might have to delay construction of Vivec City … well, Veloth isn't the only saint I'll be honoring tonight.\n\nSafe travels, friend."
"116521668-0-12377";"Rhea sees but a sliver of what's to come. Even now, Princes unbound by Sotha Sil's compact move against Nirn. I retire to Moonshadow to prepare.\n\nWe'll meet again soon, in a distant land. Perhaps sooner than you'd like. Until then, walk in twilight."
"116521668-0-12387";"Cake? I don't know. This one came out so well, I might just keep it for myself.\n\nJust kidding! You earned this special cake. Wait until you taste it! I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised."
"116521668-0-12392";"Well, of course! In my experience my loyal subjects adore being showered in the affections of their king.\n\nOh—ah, don't share that with the queen."
"116521668-0-12394";"So the Governor hoped to use the Morag Tong to cover his tracks, but this note just adds to the evidence you've already uncovered. Well done!\n\nYou have provided a great service to Seyda Neen. I'll take it from here."
"116521668-0-12395";"The governor called upon the Morag Tong to hide his involvement, but it appears they simply brought it to light. As this note and the other evidence you uncovered clearly states, he was working with the slavers.\n\nOn behalf of Seyda Neen, thank you."
"116521668-0-12421";"Oh goodie! I'm so glad I've piqued your interest!\n\nNow, how best to have you serve your Queen … I know!"
"116521668-0-12423";"Anyway you can, so long as someone is laughing!\n\nJorunn suggests you prance, dance, and sing before your king! Or do you seek to raise a toast and boast your deeds at my royal roast?"
"116521668-0-12424";"If you stripped to your small clothes and paraded through town, I'd call it a good start!"
"116521668-0-12433";"Always, hero. Oh, hey, I want you to have this. Something to remember me by until we meet again.\n\nI hope you don't leave here with the impression that all Dark Elves are conniving dirt bags. Some of us are also kind of sexy. Like me, for instance."
"116521668-0-12435";"That's what I like to hear! The more you play, the more rewards. It's as simple as that. Occasionally I'll give you specific goals with greater rewards if you can accomplish them.\n\nCome and see me anytime you wish for such a challenge."
"116521668-0-12436";"My research indicates that thirty of our most revered families each left a clue to the location of the Library of Andule.\n\nFind the remaining twenty-nine tombs, take rubbings, and before long our model will be complete and the location revealed."
"116521668-0-12449";"And such skill deserves ample reward. Keep it up, champion. Strive for victory in every match, no matter who may be your opponent."
"116521668-0-12450";"As with any skill, practice makes perfect. It's important to stay sharp out there. Champions don't just spring up overnight!\n\nYou've earned your reward."
"116521668-0-12451";"Well done! Though a team is made of no single individual, it's still important that each spoke in the wheel bears its share of the burden. \n\nYou'd do well to remember that lesson. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-12466";"Always, hero. Oh, hey, I want you to have this. Something to remember Veya by. For an outlander, I think she kind of liked you.\n\nI suppose I kind of like you, too. Really, I'm not always this morose. Next time we meet, you'll see. Take care, hero."
"116521668-0-12474";"Vivec's mighty spear, you're serious. I should be jealous, but truth be told I had my hands full just culling the Daedra that escaped the Sunken Vaults.\n\nThanks for putting an end to those Worm Cult s'wits. I can handle cleaning up the stragglers."
"116521668-0-12483";"This is one of the times I hate to be right. Was hoping someone would have run them out of the cavern already, honestly. I'll let my business partners know, and we'll decide what to do from here. Thanks for the help."
"116521668-0-12493";"Anything to stop skooma from invading Vvardenfell is worthy of a reward. Hopefully one day we can stop this operation in its tracks, but for now you've done a great deal to prevent these bandits from reaching their despicable goals."
"116521668-0-12498";"Oh, this is a nice, strong specimen you've selected for me. Isn't it adorable! And you have the notes too, excellent! I'll begin my research at once.\n\nYou've done a huge favor not only for me, but for all kwama kind. Thank you."
"116521668-0-12504";"I appreciate your help and your concern, but what possible harm could glancing at a few dusty scrolls cause? Here, for your trouble. I seem to have some extra gold after adjusting my staff's compensation.\n\nOh, Stibbons, since you like to read …."
"116521668-0-12516";"Rhea sees but a sliver of what's to come. Princes unbound by Sotha Sil's compact move against Nirn. I retire to Moonshadow to prepare.\n\nVile's work in Vvardenfell was the first taste of something far worse. Ready yourself, child. Night draws near."

"116521668-0-12582";"As promised, here's your payment. I even threw in some extra for going above and beyond what we could have ever asked of you.\n\nIf we ever decide to start an official Ghost Hunters Guild, you'll be the first to know, my friend."
"116521668-0-12611";"Then let it be known that from this moment forth, you shall be called the Champion of Vivec! And along with my thanks, take this modest reward. \n\nI foresee even greater achievements in your future, but for now be content to be the hero of Morrowind!"
"116521668-0-12617";"If you're lying, you do so remarkably well. If you're not, it is of no concern to me. You will receive the same coinage either way.\n\nTake it and be about your business. And tell Edryno that if she fails again, I shall locate another mushroom seller."
"116521668-0-12626";"I would hope. You came to us, after all.\n\nTraylan and Beleru are just down the hall. They should already have assignments for you. Speak to either of them to get started."
"116521668-0-12627";"Meet with the Ashlander tribes. Hear their problems and offer your aid. Show your respect for their traditions, and you will surely find someone willing to speak with you. \n\nHelp all you can, and let them see not everyone is our enemy."
"116521668-0-12631";"I'm sure you did all that you could. We have to be grateful for what we have saved, not for what we have lost. I'll begin my research on his notes to see what damage his magic may have caused.\n\nI thank you for your service."
"116521668-0-12633";"<Pinned to the bounty board is a note from General Thoron:>\n\n""I received word of your success in slaying enemy Wardens, soldier. Accept this bonus pay. It has been well-earned!"""

"116521668-0-12674";"I must inform the Psijic Ritemaster. If Daedra have breached the gates of the Clockwork City, we must move swiftly.\n\nAs for you, I would counsel vigilance. Whoever set these events in motion no doubt sees you as a threat. Take this, and my thanks."
"116521668-0-12675";"I must inform the Psijic Ritemaster. If Daedra have breached the gates of the Clockwork City, anything is possible. We must be prepared.\n\nPlease, take this as a token of the Psijic Order's appreciation—and mine."
"116521668-0-12676";"I will inform the Psijic Ritemaster. Nocturnal's intrigues in the Clockwork City cannot be the end of her plot. A greater scheme is brewing, I know it. We must be prepared.\n\nIn the meantime, please take this, and my thanks."
"116521668-0-12678";"Flap my feathers and call me a pigeon, but these will do nicely! Even the Duke of Crows will be impressed, and he's a hard one to please.\n\nI have something for you in return. A prize for the Blackfeather Court's favorite crow-friend."
"116521668-0-12680";"The Clockwork City owes you a tremendous debt. Gascone's death is … was necessary to safeguard the people. Now we just have to follow the clues he left behind.\n\nPlease, take this. And my thanks."
"116521668-0-12709";"I know—it's better than not knowing, always wondering, but …. \n\nThank you, for ending this. I—I need a moment. I don't think Bolin has long."
"116521668-0-12715";"Ah! You've done Slag Town a great service, hotshot. You don't know how hard it can be to watch the little ones shiver at night.\n\nTake this reward and my thanks. I hope you'll choose to work with us again."
"116521668-0-12720";"Good work, hotshot. You have my thanks.\n\nIf only those brass buffoons knew how useful this stuff can actually be. Don't go spreading rumors, though. We don't want anyone else cutting into our supply, right?"
"116521668-0-12725";"Excellent! You've helped many of my citizens today. There should be a few less coughs once we get more filters set up.\n\nBe sure to stop by again for another request."
"116521668-0-12730";"Well done! You've earned your gold today.\n\nI'll make sure to let <<1>> know we have more sap in stock. He's been wanting to try out a new adhesive bandage he's thought up. Not that I'll be volunteering anytime soon for that particular experiment."
"116521668-0-12735";"No excuses, just results. I knew I liked you, hotshot.\n\nI'll be sure to tell <<1>> that we have more of this in stock. It's scrap compared to actual glyphs, but we make do with what we can get."
"116521668-0-12740";"Thanks for taking the time to get the syrup as well. The little ones stopped raising a fuss once we began adding it to the tonics. A bit of sweet always helps.\n\nYou've done Slag Town a great service. I hope you'll work with us again."
"116521668-0-12755";"Dead? Shadow array? I—I suppose the perception tabulator will explain everything. I'll study it right away.\n\nIn the meantime, take this. A little something for helping the Clockwork Apostles today."
"116521668-0-12757";"With the shadow barrier removed, we can move freely between the Brass Fortress and the Cogitum again. \n\nNow, we have a Daedric Prince to thwart and a god to save. I hope you're ready."
"116521668-0-12758";"Then you shall have it—along with a prize from my vault. This treasure is, and always has been, yours.\n\nPut these gifts to good use … or do not. Triumphs await regardless. We are, all of us, bound by our natures. Your nature demands victory."
"116521668-0-12759";"I've met few heroes like you. Very few. I take this matter of the Triad upon myself, but in truth, you may be the one that saves us. The Prisoner who frees the world.\n\nWe shall see. Farewell."
"116521668-0-12761";"I'm not a citizen. And even if I were, I'd not waste time wading through their opaque bureaucracy. You've proven yourself to be more than capable. I have no doubt you'll figure something out.\n\nGain your sponsorship. We will speak again soon."
"116521668-0-12763";"Yes. One life a season in exchange for a bountiful harvest. What could be more noble than sacrificing your life to feed the hungry?\n\nAnd I'll continue to work with the remaining apprentices. Maybe we can find another way … someday."
"116521668-0-12764";"You're right. The sacrifice is too great. Lector Naril turned Sotha Sil's dream into a nightmare.\n\nI'll work with the remaining apprentices. Together, we'll find another way for the Everwound Wellspring to help the Clockwork City."
"116521668-0-12770";"It's as I feared. The Shadow breached the Cogitum Centralis—Lord Seht's seat of power. If it reaches the core … if it removes Lord Seht from the Throne-Aligned …. We can't let that happen.\n\nYou should steel yourself for the battles ahead."
"116521668-0-12771";"Slaughtering the beasts of the Reach until that primal Forge coughed up a lump of molten rage, and then beating that into a thousand bits too? We'll be calling you the ""Butcher of Bloodroot"" after this.\n\nTake your spoils, Butcher. You earned them."
"116521668-0-12772";"Reachmen are a lot like the old Orc clans, just dumber and weaker. What they lack in strength, or smarts, or honor, they make up in vicious brutality. \n\nNot everyone's got the guts to face a slow painful death, so that merits a key at least."
"116521668-0-12773";"Takes some grit to rip out your own heart and stick some shiny rock in its place, so I suppose those Dreadhorn warriors were worthy of a tidy reward.\n\nYour key and cut. Tear one out for me next Heart's Day and maybe I won't break yours."
"116521668-0-12775";"The Nord-songs claim you waded through the enemy like the wrath of Molag Bal, took that bull warlord by the horns, and pitched him clear over the Jerall Mountains. You can show me how you wrestled him down after a few drinks.\n\nTake your spoils."
"116521668-0-12776";"Besting those mangy curs wouldn't be much to brag about, if you hadn't been facing them down fifty-to-one, and all those minotaurs, and the angry dead—from what I hear—so I suppose you earned your key and cut.\n\nLet the Nords toast you tonight!"
"116521668-0-12777";"For marching right into the middle of a pitched battle and sending those rampaging beasts off with their tails between their legs? I'd say routing an army is worth a key and cut, even if it was a shabby one."
"116521668-0-12799";"The Congress of Calibration thanks you for your service. And on a personal note, I applaud your mercy. Gascone's an insufferable traitor, but he's still an apostle. Lord Seht always said we should take care of each other.\n\nTake this, and my thanks."
"116521668-0-12802";"Ah, so you have? You have the gratitude of the Clockwork Apostles.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I must inspect the memories to see if they were damaged by the attack. You would be surprised how fragile they can be."
"116521668-0-12810";"I value your service and partnership, assistant. Please, take this as a token of my appreciation.\n\nIf I understand the bureaucracy correctly, I may be here in the Brass Fortress for a while. Feel free to seek me out, should you require my aid."
"116521668-0-12816";"I have maintained this position for over a millennium. It is my sole purpose, the path given to me by the Divine Metronome. I have no regrets.\n\nI thank you for your efforts. A reward is common for these situations, yes? Here you are."
"116521668-0-12817";"Oh! Uh. There's absolutely no need to concern yourself about that, I assure you! All that matters is that the Brass Fortress will have water tonight because of us, am I right?\n\nHere, you've been such a great help. You should be properly rewarded."
"116521668-0-12828";"That's great! Let's have a look, eh? Why that slimy son-of-a-scrib—he's been lying through his teeth! I could have been growing these mushrooms the whole time. Still, his pickling recipe is just what I needed to make use of 'em. \n\nGreat work!"
"116521668-0-12837";"This is incredible. Where did you find it? I hope it wasn't too much trouble.\n\nPromise I'll stretch this bottle long as it'll last, now that I know better!"
"116521668-0-12838";"Nothing too difficult, I promise. Most of the ingredients should be readily available in Clockwork City, so you shouldn't have to jump through any more hoops for a decent meal."
"116521668-0-12843";"The real Lord Seht will aid us eventually, I know it. In the meantime, we must do for ourselves.\n\nThank you for everything you've done. It appears we'll have to do a lot more before this is through."
"116521668-0-12846";"It is done. The recalibration may take some time, but the proctor will make a full recovery. I know she will put this gift to good use.\n\nPlease, take this as well. A token from my personal collection. It is, and always has been, yours."
"116521668-0-12860";"Oh, I have a few tricks up my sleeve, but first I'll need to expel Orryn's soul from the Dragon. I'm sure our new compatriots would love to settle their unfinished business with our host.\n\nWe should be able to handle things from here. Thank you."
"116521668-0-12861";"With the cult defeated and the bodies burned, there should be no way for the illness to spread. All thanks to you, of course.\n\nNow, as for my part, I will ensure that Scalecaller's soul can never return again."
"116521668-0-12868";"Then let me be the first to officially welcome you as an Associate of the Fighters Guild! Get out there and take the fight to the Daedra!"
"116521668-0-12870";"Excellent! You are now a Student of the Mages Guild! Every book you find will now earn you reputation in the guild."
"116521668-0-12871";"The Precursor mentioned he was made of Clockwork and Dwemer parts. I'd keep an eye out for the former as you travel around Clockwork City, and search Dwemer ruins out in Tamriel for the latter.\n\nAnd of course I have your reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-12874";"Such crunch! Such chewy bits! The Blackfeather Court will feast tonight! Thank you, crow-friend.\n\nNow, these aren't quite as tasty, but they are what we agreed to. Perhaps you could trade them for something yummy."
"116521668-0-12875";"Rare delicacies for this land of brass and silver! These morsels must be placed in the hoard with all due haste … after I take a nibble to ensure their quality.\n\nHere's your reward. Not as tasty, but I suspect it will suffice."
"116521668-0-12876";"Perfect, perfect! Our hoard grows larger and the featherless curs go hungry, all at the same time! That will teach them to show proper respect to the Blackfeather Court.\n\nTake these coins for your efforts, crow-friend."
"116521668-0-12877";"Look at that! Actual paper, how quaint. In the meantime, take this for what you did for Novice Oscard and the Clockwork City.\n\nMay your pistons never clog and your gears spin freely, my friend!"
"116521668-0-12879";"Heart. That's not something you hear a lot about in a place that runs on gears and cogs. Here, this is your share of the treasure. You earned it.\n\nThe people of Slag Town have a new future to forge, thanks to you."
"116521668-0-12880";"Oh, what a relief. Not that she would refuse, of course.\n\nNow, for all that you've done, I feel it only proper that you should take ownership of the Precursor. I've learned all I can from it, and I'm sure you'll find it useful for … something."
"116521668-0-12881";"Verified. The Imperfect has been tested and the sequence plaques are in your possession.\n\nThank you for completing this task in a timely manner. The information obtained will be useful to furthering the Imperfect prototype. Here is your reward."
"116521668-0-12882";"Verified. The Daedric incursions have been dealt with.\n\nThank you for completing this task in a timely manner. Clockwork City is now safe because of your actions. Here is your reward."
"116521668-0-12883";"He does, does he? Well, I have a few words for Raynor, as well. We're partners, and partners don't abandon each other when the going gets rough.\n\nAnyway, thanks for making sure he got back here safe and sound. I appreciate it."
"116521668-0-12884";"He does, does he? I suppose that's only fair, since I saved a few choice words for him, too. We're partners, and partners don't abandon each other over a minor disagreement!\n\nAnyway, thanks for helping my brother out there. I appreciate it."
"116521668-0-12886";"Even better! With the information recorded in the device, we'll be able to analyze the realm in great detail. Take this for your efforts, with our thanks.\n\nAnd may the Great Gear always spin in your general direction!"
"116521668-0-12888";"Dead? I—I'm sorry to hear that. But at least you were able to complete his analysis of the shadow realm. Perhaps we'll be able to seal the portal now.\n\nTake this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-12891";"My faith in you continues. Thank you for your assistance, and I hope you'll work with us again. Besides, these fans won't oil themselves!\n\nYour due reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-12894";"So you have. These samples bear a lingering, necromantic taint, but from what will be up to the Sapiarchs to determine.\n\nYour adequacy will be noted in the record. Here is your reward."
"116521668-0-12895";"Good. Let's hope those warding stones hold. I would hate to see a beast like that return.\n\nIn any event, this will bring the people of Russafeld some comfort. You continue to defy expectations, newcomer. Well done."
"116521668-0-12896";"Every victory against the Abyssal Cabal is a triumph for Summerset. The Divine Prosecution acknowledges the completion of this contract. Here is your reward.\n\nI'll send scouts to the cove to deal with any tainted coral that remains."
"116521668-0-12897";"Excellent. It's somewhat of a shame to kill such powerful beasts, but of course Summerset citizens come first. I'll let my superiors know the area is safe once more.\n\nThough helping the Isle is its own reward, here's a more substantial offering."
"116521668-0-12898";"It's a travesty that these weren't retrieved by one of our own, but I can stomach outsider assistance far better than leaving the fallen to lie without memorial.\n\nTake no offense when I say I hope you won't be called on to perform such duties again."
"116521668-0-12899";"And you managed to keep all your limbs intact. Commendable. \n\nThe Office of Divine Prosecution thanks you for your labors. Mark me—our navy will return to its former strength soon, and these Sea Elves will pay a heavy price for what they've done."
"116521668-0-12900";"Most excellent. Water cycle regulation isn't possible without properly maintained filters. You're the reason why we won't have to drink oily water tonight!\n\nHere's your well-earned reward."
"116521668-0-12902";"That's good to hear. Not many know how the galvanic engine's process works, so this task may be a bit tricky to boast about. You can always brag to me though. I'd be happy to give you my continued admiration.\n\nAnd a reward is needed, of course."
"116521668-0-12907";"Heart. That's not something you hear a lot about in a place that runs on gears and cogs. Here, this is your share of the treasure. You earned it.\n\nOh, and Palbatan wants you to meet him in the Outlaws Refuge afterward. He has something for you, too."
"116521668-0-12908";"A grim reminder of how far these great Dunmer have fallen, but perhaps Sotha Sil can mend them as he will surely mend their souls.\n\nThank you for this kind gesture."
"116521668-0-12909";"There is a glimmer in these fragments. Do they resonate with the beneficence of the Three, I wonder? I will keep them with the soul gems in the hope they offer some soothing presence to the Saints.\n\nPlease accept this as thanks."
"116521668-0-12910";"The designs of Lord Seht never cease to amaze. Even so broken, you can feel how they resonate with the world around. I don't know that I can mend these things, but I will explore their therapeutic benefits on my wards.\n\nMay this benefit you in turn."
"116521668-0-12911";"Thank you for delivering the Three's mercy to those wayward souls.They've endured much in their lifetimes, they deserve to have some rest.\n\nYou are always welcome here, should you wish to pay your respects."
"116521668-0-12912";"You have done a great service today. For me, for the Saints, for the Three. This place can become a place of healing once again.\n\nThere is a long road ahead, but take this with my gratitude."
"116521668-0-12913";"They may not have possessed a divine spark, but you must have felt the power of the Saints' souls. It must have been the will of the Three to see their beloved cohort finally granted rest.\n\nHere, an offering for one who walks the path of Sainthood."
"116521668-0-12924";"This means more than you know. The gro-Morkul clan had all but given up finding this sword again. Now we can finally return to Orsinium with our heads high. \n\nThank you. Your actions deserve a greater reward than this, but it's been a slow year."
"116521668-0-12925";"I suppose I have to. I'll admit, the mutt's more useful than most. She at least keeps the rats at bay. Besides, I don't think anyone else would.\n\nThank you for letting me know. Here's something for your troubles."
"116521668-0-12926";"Seht bless you! I can't wait to delve into all this collected data. Please, take this for your trouble. Knowledge may go beyond value, but I hope this shows my gratitude.\n\nCome on Brassie, let's get you set up for analysis!"
"116521668-0-12927";"The Brass Fortress thanks you for your cooperation in this matter. All citizens are entitled to a reward for this service.\n\nGo forth and create, citizen."
"116521668-0-12928";"Indeed, but not until we finish studying the pearl Valsirenn brought us. There are mysteries to unravel and Val believes you will be instrumental to our success.\n\nWe can get started immediately, unless you want to explore our island first."
"116521668-0-12931";"We'll show Marieve the hospitality of the Mages Guild and make sure she's fully recovered from her ordeal. Then I'll make sure to get her back home.\n\nThanks for your aid in this matter. Now get to Summerset and do what you do best, my friend!"

"116521668-0-12946";"It's as I feared. The Shadow breached the Cogitum Centralis—Lord Seht's seat of power. If it reaches the core … if it removes Lord Seht from the Throne-Aligned …. We can't let that happen.\n\nYou should steel yourself for the battles ahead."
"116521668-0-12947";"Oh yes, these will do nicely! The Court preens in elegance and splendor as the featherless curs languish in muck and mire.\n\nTake these coins for your efforts, crow-friend. And may your feathers always stay groomed!"
"116521668-0-12949";"Such foolish trinkets. I love them! The Court will have such fun. Our play, it will be epic!\n\nYou have once again demonstrated your respect and loyalty, crow-friend. Take these with our gratitude."
"116521668-0-12983";"Knight Darien needs to recover his strength first and restore the Dawnbreaker. Then we can attempt to unblock the path and see where I took the Heart of Transparent Law.\n\nFor now, take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-12984";"Sparkle and shine! These will do nicely. Even the Duke of Crows should be impressed, and he's a hard one to please.\n\nI have something for you in return. A prize for the Blackfeather Court's favorite crow-friend."
"116521668-0-12994";"Emile is free to leave our island. Permanently. The Sapiarchs and the Mages Guild clearly have a long way to go before we can rely upon each other.\n\nAs for you—I must confess, I find your diligence … commendable. Take this, and my apologies."
"116521668-0-12995";"Mercifully, yes. The Mages Guild promised to imprison Emile for the rest of his brief Breton life. I have no reason to doubt their sincerity given your honesty today.\n\nLet us put this matter behind us. The Guild and the Sapiarchs must move forward."
"116521668-0-13001";"The Daedric Princes require minions to carry out their will, and the Sload have always had an interest in the green and pleasant island. It isn't hard to see why they might work together.\n\nFor now, you have my thanks for assisting Valsirenn."
"116521668-0-13010";"I'm not sure there is another way. With the Heart of Transparent Law, Nocturnal can control the Crystal Tower. And with the Crystal Tower, she can … well, I'm not sure why she wants the tower.\n\nWe'll need to consult a few experts about that."
"116521668-0-13012";"If he's willing to talk in a letter, why can't he talk to me in person? No matter. This is no longer your concern, but you did aid me. You deserve recompense. Take this and consider our business concluded."
"116521668-0-13013";"I don't understand any of this, but I do know you involved yourself in a matter that you had no need to. And I suppose you were trying to help. That deserves some recompense.\n\nTake this for your efforts. I won't trouble you again."
"116521668-0-13015";"Thank the Divines.\n\nYou know, Glardir finally solved the mystery of why I was spared. The Illuminated One thought I was too boring. Imagine that! I guess it pays to be dull sometimes. And to have strong allies like you. Take care, ceruval."
"116521668-0-13020";"Difficult to say. The fact that he's been fraternizing with apraxics won't reflect well on him. But at least you proved he's not a murderer. That's something, right?\n\nYou've done far more than rescue a stray High Elf, cerum. Take this, and my thanks."
"116521668-0-13029";"Looks like someone got bitten by the hunting bug on this little adventure. Savor your victory, killer. Cey-Tarn Keep is safe again thanks to you. \n\nJudging by these results, I should rope random strangers into my work more often. Kidding, kidding."
"116521668-0-13030";"Ugh. Look, I don't know how you do things … wherever it is you come from, but here on Summerset, we try not to set evil spirits loose. At least the weather cleared a bit.\n\nHere, I'll pay you for that key and we'll pretend this never happened. Fair?"
"116521668-0-13032";"Yes, I agree. You've gone above and beyond protecting me during this expedition, though the details seem a bit complicated. To think I would have been trapped here!\n\nI'd say our contract is concluded. Thank you for all you've done."
"116521668-0-13039";"There's a whole world beyond these walls. I think Lotus and I are long overdue to see some of it.\n\nI hope we cross paths again along the way."
"116521668-0-13047";"I opposed this line of reasoning when Leythen first suggested it, as bargains with the Princes don't often end well. But what choice do we have?\n\nStill, thanks for finding a way forward. While it's a long shot, at least it represents a chance."
"116521668-0-13048";"Next? Every action we take can tip the balance of the flow of time. Bask in the moment and realize that you have done well, my mortal friend. You have saved the Crystal Tower. Saved Summerset. Saved reality itself.\n\nEven I could not have done better."
"116521668-0-13049";"Don't turn on me now! The Eye gave us glimpses of Mannimarco's work. With time we might be able to learn more about his process! Know your enemy, right?\n\nI hope I can count on you to keep this a secret. Here's a little something for the effort."
"116521668-0-13052";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13053";"And here is your payment, as contracted. I am pleased you chose to honor our arrangement instead of siding with that scoundrel. \n\nOh, I see it now. You! You're the perfect subject for my masterpiece! Your shining loyalty, your pure heart. Perfect!"
"116521668-0-13054";"I knew I'd sway you to my side. After all, my charisma is only matched by my artistic talent.\n\nWith these, I'll have an even easier time persuading the royal court to hire me as their personal artist. Tindoria will never overshadow me again!"
"116521668-0-13056";"Excellent! I'm glad you did. I just know you'll lend an air of respectability to the place.\n\nYou won't regret your decision."
"116521668-0-13057";"Excellent! I'm glad you did. I just know you'll lend an air of respectability to the place.\n\nYou won't regret your decision."
"116521668-0-13058";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13059";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13060";"Another noble soul lost to the Sea Elves. They've claimed too many in their relentless raiding. Vipers.\n\nWe will take things from here. You are to be commended for your service to the crown."
"116521668-0-13061";"I'll note your remarks for the inquiry to follow. The sack of Sea Keep under Pandermalion's watch will reflect poorly, though his heroics today will temper the attitudes of the court.\n\nYour service to the crown is appreciated."
"116521668-0-13062";"Your word will not suffice, but in light of these allegations I will take command of Sea Keep until the matter is settled by court marshal.\n\nNow excuse me, I must see to it."
"116521668-0-13063";"You helped me remember my true encounter with K'Tora and his Abyssal Cabal. I remember how they defeated me three hundred years ago. Compelled me to do their bidding. Made me forget.\n\nFor now, I need solitude to seek the memories that still elude me."
"116521668-0-13064";"Of course! They're different all over. I've taken part in cliff jumping, anchor tossing, and even drunken echatere racing … though Orsinium had to cancel that one.\n\nSimply ask, and I'll send you to the best celebrations in Tamriel!"
"116521668-0-13065";"Y'ffre's mercy …. How could you—why didn't you save him? Damn this place! Damn the Prosecution!\n\nHere, take this thing. I found it under Celan's bed. I never want to see it again! I never want to see you again! I … gods help me."
"116521668-0-13067";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13071";"Exactly. You'll just need to find the properly labeled display case in the Vault of Moawita and place the relic within it. That should help safely bind its curse.\n\nWell, it looks like you're all set! And here's a little something for your trouble."
"116521668-0-13076";"Good. I'll get these tokens back to the Thieves Guild. Honestly, this is one of the smoother operations I've been a part of … sad as that is. \n\nMaybe one day we'll do another job together. Not likely, but maybe."
"116521668-0-13080";"Well thank goodness for that. I did notice the sky cleared up a bit. Maybe I'll finally be able to go home.\n\nI'll take that key off your hands if you'll part with it. The justiciar would find a use for it, no doubt. We have a deal?"
"116521668-0-13082";"You've been an able guide to heroism. Keeping me on the righteous road in the face of adversity! When I sing of the divine messenger who set me on this path, know that it's your praises I sing!\n\nOh, I like that."
"116521668-0-13084";"Let's keep our voice down, shall we?\n\nSo, the hulkynd disappoints once again. How utterly expected. As the one who delivered my parcel, I suspect you'll want the reward. Have it and be off with you."
"116521668-0-13085";"I never thought of it like that. So he truly believes our association would ruin my career, does he? Then I'll have to respect his wishes. For now, at least.\n\nThank you for all the help you've been. Even if the outcome isn't quite what I wished for."
"116521668-0-13086";"I … suppose you're right.\n\nTableau has shown me nothing but kindness, despite my status. Besides, she's gone through such great lengths just to see me again. If this is what she wishes, I shall continue to be by her side."
"116521668-0-13087";"She did? I mean, of course she did! Rigurt had every confidence in you!\n\nThank you, my friend. Take this with the gratitude of the Nord Cultural Exchange. I think you'll like it better than that stinky Essence of Mammoth that I saw you ogling."
"116521668-0-13091";"It involves my missing memories. I've recalled an important detail and I need to show it to you.\n\nFor now, let me compensate you for your efforts so far. I appreciate your help in all this."
"116521668-0-13095";"This journey hasn't played out quite like I imagined, but it would have been impossible without your timely intervention.\n\nSince I'm going to be making it up anyway, I think I'll model the hero of this epic after you. Remind me to send you a copy."
"116521668-0-13099";"Take a moment to rest, but once you've shaken off any residual effects of the spell I might require your assistance. \n\nAnd take this. I assume it belongs to you. It was near your unconscious body when I found you."
"116521668-0-13113";"Even now, I still feel for them. What a miserable fate. I wish it could have been different. That Corgrad might have been redeemed ….\n\nI used up most of my means traveling here, but take this with my gratitude."
"116521668-0-13114";"I suspected as much. Well, at least now I can put this whole incident behind me.\n\nHere's your payment, for completion of this task as well as your … discretion. There's no need for the torrid details of this affair to get out."
"116521668-0-13115";"I knew I was sending them to their deaths, but still. I couldn't let Avanaire get away.\n\nIf not for you, the surrounding towns would have been overrun with yaghra. You've saved many today … even if some were lost. Here, take this for your service."
"116521668-0-13119";"Well, that is troublesome. Still, I expect Narilin knows well enough to keep away. And no one else need know of her change.\n\nHere's your payment. And, of course, discretion is key here. As far as you and I are concerned, Niralin died in that grove."
"116521668-0-13120";"I see. Well, at least I won't have to begin my marriage negotiations anew. As long as Niralin's willing to put this incident behind her, all will be well.\n\nHere's your payment, for a task well completed and your … discretion on the matter."
"116521668-0-13126";"Oh, he put you up to that, didn't he? Papa always loves to embellish his journeys.\n\nWhatever the truth is, I'm just glad you brought him home safe. If all newcomers are so kind, Summerset will be fortunate to have you."
"116521668-0-13133";"With Admiral Viscarne dead, now is the time to strike. I shall rally my people and call Sunnawel to my side. We'll form a resistance the likes of which these sea snakes have never known.\n\nThank you for making this all possible."
"116521668-0-13135";"Yeah. Normally I'd put on a show, but this was personal. Honestly, I took it easy on him. If I'd really poured it on, he'd be breathing through his ear hole.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the help. You ever need somebody knocked out, you let me know, eh?"
"116521668-0-13151";"That's a very meaningful gesture from a newcomer. The Office of Divine Prosecution will have to handle their official return, of course, to preserve the integrity of the fallen, but I'm sure the families will be grateful for their return."
"116521668-0-13152";"Raz did indeed! On behalf of Queen Ayrenn, this is for you.\n\nIronic how Summerset was saved by one of the newcomers it so distrusts. This is a good lesson for the High Elves, yes? Maybe now they'll realize that change is not so bad after all."
"116521668-0-13153";"I can just imagine it. You and Scalecaller, weapons raised, clashing on the snowy mountaintop in a battle for the ages …. Well damn, maybe I should have been a bard.\n\nHere's your reward, and a promise that I won't be taking up poetry anytime soon."
"116521668-0-13154";"You know, facing off against a foe? Well, that's just another day for us. Facing off against a plague? Now that takes some guts.\n\nThere's a few Undaunted who would even consider this pledge, but here you are. I'd say a reward is in order."
"116521668-0-13155";"Heard those creatures in that mountain aren't right. Seems this disease has them riled up, aggressive as all Oblivion. Would have been just my type of pledge, if not for all the pus.\n\nI'd say you earned yourself a reward … and a good scrub down."
"116521668-0-13157";"I don't think it gets better than letting a schemer finish their master plan to perfection, then kicking the whole thing over! Did he cry? Haha!\n\nFor killing Orryn the Black and smashing his pet Thurvokun to pieces, you've earned your key and cut!"
"116521668-0-13158";"I'll tell Yisareh she'll need to find more than brittle bones and pasty necromancers for future pledges. They don't put up enough of a fuss.\n\nFor turning Fang Lair back into a plain old graveyard. You've earned your key and your cut."
"116521668-0-13159";"When I sent you to kill that lot of necromancers, I didn't expect you'd get to tangle with anything as nasty as a Dragon! Dead or not, I'm jealous.\n\nYou're gonna tell me all about it over drinks sometime. Take your key and cut, Dragon Slayer."
"116521668-0-13162";"Excellent! The furnace is the only suitable place for any Daedric scripture. And destroying those cocoons should put an end to those Daedras' dark machinations. \n\nYou've done Summerset a great service, deputy. And so quickly too! My."
"116521668-0-13163";"Ah, very good! The Sapiarchs will be pleased to hear it. From what I've heard, their 58th Day of the Divine Reverence to Mara is soon to take place. These roses are vital to that ceremony!\n\nYour diligence is duly noted by the Divine Prosecution."
"116521668-0-13164";"And collected the plans as well! Very good. These will be useful for tracking their movements. As soon as we have the resources, we'll rid Summerset of this filth, once and for all.\n\nI thank you for your service. Live well and serve, deputy."
"116521668-0-13165";"Fantastic! One less unwanted nuisance to worry about on our fair shores.\n\nThank you for your contribution to keeping our home pure."
"116521668-0-13166";"Well done. Let's hope those vile things are sealed away for good.\n\nYou have the thanks of the Office of Divine Prosecution—and the Psijic Order, I suspect. If Esulo recovers any more of those books, I'll know who to call."
"116521668-0-13169";"Yes, yes! If you cannot make a trade in good faith, what will the world come to? Besides, us newcomers must band together on an island this cruel."
"116521668-0-13170";"First Madja steals my crew, then my only means of survival? Oh, how will this one tell Nubani. He promised her a life of riches and luxury. Now we'll have to sell the ship just to get by.\n\nStill, you've done much. Thank you, walker."
"116521668-0-13175";"If Nubani is willing to go so far, she must truly be unhappy. How can Renzir force her to continue on with such a life? \n\nThis one will use these goods to retire from smuggling, just as his Nubani wishes."
"116521668-0-13184";"These animals deserve better than to be left to fend for themselves. I owe them that much.\n\nI'll do everything I can for them. You have my word."
"116521668-0-13204";"Normally, I'd dispatch every soldier at my disposal to deal with these geysers. However, the ongoing war has depleted our forces. It might be time to reach out to more people like you and Cainar's adventurers.\n\nFor now, take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-13212";"Cake? I don't know. This one came out so well, I might just keep it for myself.\n\nJust kidding! You earned this special cake. Wait until you taste it! I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised."
"116521668-0-13214";"That's excellent news! Despite my misgivings, it seems the Queen's decree has been more of a blessing than a curse. I'm not sure what we would have done without the help of newcomers like you. You have my thanks and the gratitude of all of Summerset."
"116521668-0-13230";"Very well. I hereby authorize you to execute duties on behalf of the Divine Prosecution.\n\nSeek Justiciars Farowel and Tanorian for your first assignments. They handle the administration of all contracts."
"116521668-0-13232";"We'll show Marieve the hospitality of the Mages Guild. Make sure she's fully recovered from her ordeal. Then I get her back home.\n\nThanks for your aid in this matter. I may not be an oracle, but I have a feeling we'll see each other again, my friend."
"116521668-0-13233";"The most valuable gift—knowledge! Please, use it carefully. When I learned my first spell, I accidentally banished a toad to the far ends of time! At least I think I did. It hasn't come back yet.\n\nCongratulations! You've earned it—and my thanks."
"116521668-0-13242";"This particular danger has passed, but I will alert my colleagues in the Psijic Order to be on their guard. I suggest that you and these others remain vigilant as well.\n\nIn the meantime, take this as a token of my appreciation."
"116521668-0-13244";"My, don't these beauties look tempting. Perhaps I'll have a few sips. Just to get me going before I set off on the road. \n\nHere's your reward, for services rendered and all that."
"116521668-0-13247";"Excellent. And by your own admission, he's dead. I honestly can't think of a better conclusion to this whole affair. I'll just say he was kidnapped or some such.\n\nHere's a reward, both for delivering the letter and keeping this matter … discreet."
"116521668-0-13261";"I accept your statement and will render judgment accordingly. Whether or not he intended to do harm, his actions are in violation of acceptable conduct.\n\nGiven his lack of remorse, he will be imprisoned until his debt to society is repaid."
"116521668-0-13262";"Given that your testimony is the only real evidence I have, I see no reason to continue dragging out this affair. Eslion will be fined for trespassing and criminal mischief then released.\n\nIf I see him here again, he will be jailed."
"116521668-0-13267";"Yes, given your experience with the craft, that seems to be in order. \n\nI am pleased to officially certify you in the art of jewelry crafting. You are free to fulfill any writs you may find at your leisure."
"116521668-0-13268";"Most certainly. I hereby ordain you officially certified in the art of jewelry crafting. You may begin fulfilling writs immediately.\n\nHere's a small reward to get you started in your journey."
"116521668-0-13273";"You did? Well, I'll be taking that. Wouldn't want it to go to waste, after all.\n\nThanks again for all you've done. These two would have never been able to make it out, if not for you. This reward isn't much, but it's the best I can do."
"116521668-0-13276";"Yes, he commissioned this on the announcement of our wedding … gaudy thing. He's dead you say? Just like Durell to leave me a mess to clean up.\n\nKeep that bauble for your trouble. It must be worth something to someone."
"116521668-0-13277";"Well, that's a relief. For now, at least.\n\nI'm afraid the situation has grown more … complicated. But we can discuss that later. For now, you've done the Order proud. You're clearly ready to take your next steps. Use this wisely."
"116521668-0-13284";"The threats we face are grave indeed. Fortunately, the Old Ways always provide. Wisdom in the face of uncertainty. Patience in the face of turmoil. And of course, strength in the face of danger.\n\nTake this, initiate. And my thanks."
"116521668-0-13286";"Yes. I was able to find something suitable within the keep's stores.\n\nTake it, along with the knowledge that you have done both the Silver Dawn and all of Tamriel a great service. Your actions today have saved many. Be proud."
"116521668-0-13287";"I've got to admit, the Moon Hunter Pack was something else. It's not everyday that werewolves are able to take over a Silver Dawn base! But in the end, even they couldn't go up against a true Undaunted.\n\nYour key and cut, as promised."
"116521668-0-13288";"I've always found that werewolves aren't too hard to kill. Nasty brutes, sure, but they're always dumb as the curs they take after.\n\nStill, you've certainly bloodied your hands to my satisfaction. And that deserves a key."
"116521668-0-13289";"Slaughtering your way through a bunch of cursed curs is one thing. But defeating Vykosa? If the legends are true, she's been hunted for centuries. And here you are, the one who finally put her down.\n\nHere's your spoils. You certainly earned them."
"116521668-0-13291";"You heard the fetching stag. It's me or him.\n\nStill, none of this is your fault. I may not be able to grant you a boon, but here. You deserve a reward for helping me so greatly."
"116521668-0-13292";"Hunting down a murderous indrik, tearing out its heart, and then taking that trophy back from your strongest rival? Now that's a worthy tale.\n\nTake your spoils. You earned them."
"116521668-0-13293";"Hircine's little challenge was nothing against your might. And hey, not everyone has the guts to wade through a Daedric Prince's backyard of monstrosities for bragging rights. \n\nThat earns you a key, I'd say."
"116521668-0-13294";"Chasing down a ferocious beast in a Daedric realm while being hounded by werewolves and worse is no easy task. Here's your well-earned key and cut."
"116521668-0-13296";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13297";"I am. But first we should take a moment to acknowledge your achievement. A Psijic must never sacrifice the present at the cost of an uncertain future.\n\nTake this as a reward, ceruval. I suspect you will find a use for it before long."
"116521668-0-13300";"Huh. I always imagined it a tad … bigger. Well, if it's stuffed with diamonds, I guess it doesn't much matter what size the box is.\n\nThanks for grabbing it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to crack this beauty open."
"116521668-0-13304";"As long as Summerset needs us, my order will remain. \n\nI'll rebuild. Train new riders to honor our traditions. We'll come back from this defeat, stronger than ever. I assure you, this isn't the end of the Welkynars."
"116521668-0-13305";"As long as Summerset needs us, my order will remain. \n\nI'll rebuild. Train new riders to honor our traditions. We'll come back from this defeat, stronger than ever. I assure you, this isn't the end of the Welkynars."
"116521668-0-13306";"We'll continue to protect Summerset from all that would harm it. Once my companions rebuild their strength, of course. In the meantime, we'll oversee the efforts of rebuilding Cloudrest.\n\nI couldn't have done this without all your help. Thank you."
"116521668-0-13307";"A curious find. Perhaps some residue of her power still persists on it. If I can analyze that magic, I'll be better prepared to counter it in future battles.\n\nThank you for bringing me this."
"116521668-0-13308";"Amazing. I feel the presence of Z'Maja's power within it, though it's faint. If I can analyze that magic, I'll be better prepared to counter it in future battles.\n\nThank you for bringing me this."
"116521668-0-13309";"This is quite the find! I can already feel Z'Maja's power within the gem. With this, I'll be able to analyze her magic and learn how to possibly counter it.\n\nThank you greatly for bringing me this."
"116521668-0-13310";"I'd speak to Olorime, if you wish to help. She may have a task for you.\n\nDon't worry about my son. I'll send a message with the next mer to evacuate. And here's a little something for your troubles, of course."
"116521668-0-13315";"The scryers are already clamoring about all the information coming back from the Psijic Seals you placed. We'll locate the last four pieces of the staff soon, I know it.\n\nIn the meantime, take this. I'm sure you will put it to good use."
"116521668-0-13317";"Not well. But she will see the wisdom in it. Avoidance of temptation is a crucial element of moral action. In her heart, she knows this—perhaps better than most.\n\nBut we digress. You have more than earned this reward. Use it wisely, initiate."
"116521668-0-13320";"Indeed we do. And quickly.\n\nTake this, initiate. You will need it during the trials ahead."
"116521668-0-13322";"Exactly. Each time breach you seal brings us closer to recovering the remaining fragments.\n\nI knew you would be an asset to the Order, but you have exceeded even my expectations. You are clearly prepared for greater things. Take this, and my thanks."
"116521668-0-13328";"Many tasks yet remain. Even with the Staff of Towers here on Artaeum, the time-storms continue to rage on Tamriel.\n\nBut for now, let us give proper recognition to your success. Take this knowledge, initiate. You have most certainly earned it."
"116521668-0-13334";"Now you reap the harvest of your good works.\n\nThrough your dedication and heroism you have proved your worthiness. So, I present this final gift. Beyond this, there is nothing I can teach you.  Let the Old Ways proclaim—you are now a true Psijic."
"116521668-0-13337";"Now you reap the harvest of your good works.\n\nThrough your dedication and heroism you have proved your worthiness. So, I present this final gift. Beyond this, there is nothing I can teach you.  Let the Old Ways proclaim—you are now a true Psijic."
"116521668-0-13361";"That's excellent news! Despite my misgivings, it seems the Queen's decree has been more of a blessing than a curse. I'm not sure what we would have done without the help of newcomers like you. You have my thanks and the gratitude of all of Summerset."

"116521668-0-13414";"I knew the risk, the minute I joined the Silver Dawn. And I'm honored to have done my part, no matter the outcome.\n\nI was able to find this in the keep's stores. You've done more than enough to earn it."
"116521668-0-13423";"I state a fact. Baxilt-Gah is a necromancer. Death is a hindrance, nothing more. Still, with the grave-stakes returned, we can once again remember our ancestors.\n\nThe Naga-Kur would thank you, but they dislike outsiders. So take this reward instead."
"116521668-0-13424";"I speak truth. I expected the miregaunt to break your bones and leave your body to sink into the swamp. A pleasant surprise that you survived. And that you succeeded.\n\nHere. The Naga-Kur thank you for your service."
"116521668-0-13425";"I look upon you with newfound respect. I assumed the miregaunt would smash you to bits and destroy the relics. Cyrodilic Collections will be happy. They really love that old junk.\n\nHere. Your share. The Naga-Kur thank you for your assistance."
"116521668-0-13426";"I express genuine surprise and admiration. Whether the necromancer stays dead, hard to say. But very good that roots were destroyed.\n\nThe Naga-Kur do not hug or show any kind of affection toward outsiders. Instead, take this reward and go away."
"116521668-0-13427";"I praise your skills, outsider. I hated the thought of Naga-Kur warriors enthralled by that necromancer. Now we can show their remains proper respect and craft them into good, strong weapons.\n\nTake this reward. You earned it."
"116521668-0-13428";"I admit surprise to see that you still live, ojel. The Naga-Kur may raise their tails to outsiders, but I erect the spine of respect. You have done a great thing for my tribe.\n\nTake this and know that you have my gratitude."
"116521668-0-13430";"Then the last remnants of the old ways have finally been shed and the story of Shuxaltsei ends as it was always meant to: with a new beginning.\n\nWe are grateful for your help. The Hist were wise to guide you to us."
"116521668-0-13433";"Not only will this evidence restore the honor of my egg-family, our actions have helped save all of Murkmire. And I couldn't have done any of this without you!\n\nPlease, accept this small gift as a token of my appreciation."
"116521668-0-13436";"Immediately. I hate to set out in such a hurry, as careless haste can be fatal in this profession. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to wait.\n\nThank you for all you've done, my friend. The Remnant of Argon is almost within our grasp."
"116521668-0-13446";"Good job, my friend! I'll send the skull to my sister in Murkmire. She'll make sure it's safe.\n\nIf you ever get out that way, Famia would love to meet you. And Cyrodilic Collections can always use your help. For now, take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-13447";"We'll continue to protect Summerset from all that would harm it. Once my companions rebuild their strength, of course. In the meantime, we'll oversee the efforts of rebuilding Cloudrest.\n\nI couldn't have done this without all your help. Thank you."
"116521668-0-13449";"You and me? Goodness, what could I possibly do? You're the hero—I'm just the oft-imperiled bookworm!\n\nEven so, I would trust Xukas with my life. Jaxsik-Orrn too. If they say we go together, then we go together! If that's all right with you, I mean."
"116521668-0-13450";"For now, I think. But I can't hold this for long.\n\nThis belongs … it belongs to someone else."
"116521668-0-13451";"Lighter than it looks. I make this vow: while Xukas leads these souls to rebirth, Tsojei and I will form a new tribe here. A tribe of strength, yes, but joy and cleverness also.\n\nWhen Xukas returns, we will be here to welcome him home."
"116521668-0-13453";"Yes, yes, we'll get to that. But first, payment for services rendered! You helped me recover the Kajin-Jat Crystal and saved the entire expedition many times over. Without you, we'd certainly be dead.\n\nPlease, take this payment with my compliments."
"116521668-0-13454";"I do not miss hauling glorified bricks out of sinking deathtraps. I do miss the weight of a bountiful reward in my hand though.\n\nCheck back later. Sure to be more where that came from."
"116521668-0-13458";"Let me see. Yes, yes, these look to be Imperial. And they appear to belong to the right era. Very good. Tia Doran will be pleased.\n\nHere's your pay. If you're interested, I might need your help again later."
"116521668-0-13460";"Study it, obviously. Very carefully, if that's what you're wondering. I've been doing this long enough to be cautious with my meddling."
"116521668-0-13461";"True Undaunted can't resist mashing a button. So what if it turns the entire place into a piping hot steam bath, or charges up some giant death contraption? Just keeps us loosened up for the fight!\n\nHere's your reward for smashing the Stonekeeper!"
"116521668-0-13462";"For all their ingenuity, those Dwarves still haven't managed to build a death trap deathy enough to keep Undaunted out of their business. Frostvault was a good effort though.\n\nCracking the Vault of Mhuvnak and returning Undaunted gets you a key."
"116521668-0-13463";"Where some see a locked door, you see an opportunity—to blow it to pieces! For making a proper Undaunted entrance into the Vault of Mhuvnak, smashing its defenses, and splattering a horde of Goblins for good measure, you've earned your key and cut."
"116521668-0-13465";"You fulfilled your part of our agreement. It's not every day that I defy a Daedric Prince, but if I make a habit of it I'll be sure to get in touch.\n\nTake this as a bonus—and retainer—for whatever comes next."
"116521668-0-13466";"Hmm. You did smash up the domain of a Daedric Prince. And stole from her. And showed her a few choice fingers along the way. Yeah, I'd say that merits a key or two.\n\nThe day is yours, Meridia be damned."
"116521668-0-13467";"Sticking it to Meridia—and all her self-righteous puppets—to claim the treasures of Garlas Malatar is worth a key. Not every day you get to thumb your nose to a Daedric Prince. Maybe next time you'll bare your arse for good measure."
"116521668-0-13468";"For kicking Meridia's shiny-heinie out of Garlas Malatar and returning Undaunted, you've earned your key and cut. Keep your boots polished. There's sure to be more Daedra in need of a swift kick soon."
"116521668-0-13470";"Let me have a look. Definitely Imperial. Most certainly First Era. And the armor is in excellent condition, except for a few unseemly dents and cracks.\n\nHere's your pay. But don't get too comfortable. I'll probably have more work before too long."
"116521668-0-13472";"Thank you, friend-outsider.\n\nFor an ojel, you made an excellent Naga-Kur warrior. Please, take this as a symbol of my appreciation. You have done a wonderful thing for me and my tribe."
"116521668-0-13475";"What you didn't know didn't hurt you, and now we have the anti-venom. This payment includes a sum for non-disclosure of our trade secret.\n\nYour help is appreciated, as always."
"116521668-0-13478";"Yes, I know! I've already received applications from several adventurers who watched your performance in Mournhold. Quite a spectacle, I hear! \n\nThank you for all your help. Please, take this. Cyrodilic Collections grows stronger by the day!"
"116521668-0-13482";"Well, that was quick-quick! Thank you, my friend.\n\nI also want to thank you for handling Tamira. I hear she can be difficult to work with. But, as they say, an aged wamasu has the longest fangs. Wait, they do say that, right?"
"116521668-0-13483";"There will always be a place among our tribe for these two, and for you, beeko. I would be honored to call you root-kin for what you've done for our tribe.\n\nMake yourself at home here. You have earned a rest."
"116521668-0-13487";"She did. Kassandra seeks to claim the Remnant for herself. I extend the quill of deep surprise. That is a joke.\n\nYou saw the Remnant's history—a seed born in blood and sorrow. It cannot belong to Kassandra. We must stop her before it is too late."
"116521668-0-13488";"Oh, my. I think we may need to acquire bigger barrels ….\n\nBut you've brought enough for one day! I hope this is adequate compensation."
"116521668-0-13489";"I erect the spine of gratitude—ah, I mean, thank you, my friend!\n\nWith such help, our expedition should be prepared for whatever weather Murkmire has in store for us!"
"116521668-0-13492";"Excellent! Oh yes, I can tell, this is a frisky one! Our explorers will have nothing to fear with this chubby little fellow along for the ride.\n\nThank you, my friend!"
"116521668-0-13493";"So there were Imperial remains in the cavern? I suppose that will make Tia happy. From a historical perspective, of course. Not because there are dead Imperials.\n\nAnyway, here's your payment. If you're lucky, I'll have more work soon."
"116521668-0-13498";"The sun shines on my scales! Five vossa-satls! I am going to need so many frogs.\n\nNo worries, beeko. I will gather the little croakers myself. The next few days will be very busy, but very profitable! Speaking of profit, this is for you. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-13508";"We can discuss that in a moment. First, we owe you a significant sum. It's only right that we settle the books on that first.\n\nI hope this is sufficient? I assure you, there will be much more if you choose to join us. Once again, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-13509";"We can discuss that in a moment. First, we owe you a significant sum. It's only right that we settle the books on that first.\n\nI hope this is sufficient? I assure you, there will be much more if you choose to join us. Once again, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-13519";"Hope none of this stuff is cursed. You don't want to hear the stories about what they were used for.\n\nHere's your gold. Try not to get buried with it."
"116521668-0-13521";"This is a sad day for our tribe, but we will endure thanks to you. You are always welcome among the Bright-Throats for the aid and discretion you offered us today.\n\nPlease, put aside our troubles and your own. You've earned rest."
"116521668-0-13523";"Well, someone will be very pleased. If they're pleased, I'm pleased. When I'm pleased, you get gold.\n\nI think you'll find this worth digging through old bones."
"116521668-0-13529";"Jaxsik leads these souls to rebirth, but there is much to do here in the waking-world. I will form a new tribe under this tree. We will live with cleverness, yes, but strength also.\n\nOne day, Jaxsik will return. We will be here to welcome her home."
"116521668-0-13534";"Yes, yes, we'll get to that. But first, payment for services rendered! You helped me acquire the Kajin-Jat Crystal and recovered an Argonian treasure besides! We wouldn't have survived without you.\n\nPlease, take this payment with my compliments."
"116521668-0-13535";"Yes, yes, we'll get to that. But first, payment for services rendered! You helped me acquire the Kajin-Jat Crystal and recovered two Argonian treasures besides! Peerless work, my friend. Peerless!\n\nPlease, take this payment with my compliments."
"116521668-0-13536";"Yes, yes, we'll get to that. But first, payment for services rendered! You helped me acquire the Kajin-Jat Crystal and recovered three Argonian treasures besides! Peerless work, my friend. Peerless!\n\nPlease, take this payment with my compliments."
"116521668-0-13538";"That's me! Or, well, it's what I will be known as once I become a great thief.\n\nAnd of course, a token of my gratitude to go along with my boundless thanks! You've certainly earned it. And don't worry where I got it from. Or who, to be precise."
"116521668-0-13539";"Most excellent! Only eleven more tablets, and the Xinchei-Konu will be complete. And though I can no longer aid you, I do wish you luck.\n\nPlease, take this reward. You have done much to earn it."
"116521668-0-13543";"And it's all thanks to you. You've helped me greatly throughout this entire ordeal. I hope you find this a suitable gift for all of your troubles!\n\nAnd feel free to visit the Xinchei-Konu whenever you please."
"116521668-0-13545";"Truly? All twelve have been returned? Why, this means that the Xinchei-Konu is complete once more!\n\nHere, here! Please, take this reward. You have done much to earn it."
"116521668-0-13548";"If we had spoken a week ago, it would have been so. But, as fate would have it, Kud-Nakal has recently undergone a change herself.\n\nThank you for bringing me this letter and totem. They should make fine gifts for my beloved."
"116521668-0-13549";"Shiralas sent you? She worries too much, but that's why I love her.\n\nWe did get a little turned around. And then that creature started sniffing around. Now that you're here, I think we can make a break for it. Drooler can lead me back to Shiralas."
"116521668-0-13556";"I saw the needed resolution, and acted accordingly. That is all. My rulings are always just, though not always … pleasant.\n\nI thank you for your aid in the matter. Here, a reward is only fitting."
"116521668-0-13559";"I suppose you're right. I was as much a part of my tribe as any branch of our Hist.\n\nHere, your reward. Thanks to your actions, I feel as though I can finally find peace. And, after so many years of mourning, that is no small thing."
"116521668-0-13562";"We'll never become so combative as the Dead-Water, but perhaps its time to accept that compromise can't always be the answer. A hard lesson.\n\nOn the bright side, the trouble at hand is over. Please, accept our gratitude for all you've done."
"116521668-0-13565";"Of course. I may be a priest, but I expect no charity.\n\nBesides, you've done splendidly. We have created what wasn't, and destroyed what was. Thus is the will of change. Thus is the will of Sithis."
"116521668-0-13569";"A tree once stood within that glade. Under its leaves, Tun-Zee first saw his beloved. It does not surprise me that such a powerful memory would give itself shape.\n\nHere, a reward for your kind actions. Travel in peace, friend of the Moss-Skins."
"116521668-0-13570";"My throat is all warmed up. It's time! You can be the first to see the show!\n\nPrepare to be amazed!"
"116521668-0-13575";"Turn him back? Yes, I suppose I'll need to work on that. Or not. Imagine what might hatch from such an egg. Or maybe I'll make an omelet. I'm particularly famished after all this work!\n\nAnyway, here you are. For your assistance. It's been a pleasure!"
"116521668-0-13579";"Our injured are most grateful, Rootmender. This aloe shall be used to both heal their wounds and lessen their suffering.\n\nHere, a reward for your kindness."
"116521668-0-13583";"And now our farmers can grow the crops which are so desperately needed. In only a few seasons, our farms shall be as abundant as our faith in the Hist.\n\nOur tribe is most gracious for your help, Rootmender."
"116521668-0-13588";"My thanks, Rootmender. I will make sure his loved ones receive it.\n\nDespite our loss, I am relieved you were able to find the other envoys in good health. Next time, I'll insist they are accompanied by guards."
"116521668-0-13593";"May the Hist forever guide you, Rootmender. I feared the repercussions, should the other tribes learn of this loss. Now I have no reason to fear.\n\nYou have done much for our village. I give you this reward, as well as my gratitude."
"116521668-0-13596";"I'll take them to our leatherworkers immediately.\n\nOh, you've helped us once again, Rootmender. With your aid, Root-Whisper Village continues to prosper. Please, accept this reward as well as my tribe's heartfelt gratitude."
"116521668-0-13601";"We are not accustomed to considering the concerns of others. Something we must look to the Bright-Throats to learn. We will never be so unguarded, but tempering our strategy with restraint may be a boon.\n\nThe lesson is appreciated."
"116521668-0-13606";"The happy couples will retire to their nuptial huts to begin the process of bonding and the next generation of Bright-Throats will be born.\n\nBut for us, the work is done. Let us drink! Eat! Dance!"
"116521668-0-13614";"Good. I reveal the Xul-Mota each day. You gather your warriors do as I ask. If you survive you will have the respect of the Naga-Kur and the spoils."
"116521668-0-13623";"Based on recent events, only one course of action makes sense. We must strike at Rimmen and remove my half-sister from the throne before she rallies her forces.\n\nFirst, however, take this. Compensation for stopping the undead and killing a Dragon."
"116521668-0-13625";"So that is the Dragonhorn? It is much smaller than I thought it would be, and it looks fragile. Sound it once and it will probably crumble to dust. What are we supposed to do with such a thing?\n\nAs always, you have my thanks, five-claw."
"116521668-0-13631";"The cat can do as she pleases. Based on the skills she has already demonstrated, however, I am not averse to having her along. Just realize that I plan to utilize the weapon, despite her protestations.\n\nNow take this. For your efforts."
"116521668-0-13634";"Stupid Hadaz. Always thought he'd die from something silly, like falling down a privy. I'll let his family know.\n\nAnd this hammer? Scary business, right? I'll deliver it to the Mane's priests. They'll know what to do with it. Thanks again, rhook."
"116521668-0-13636";"They did. Numaia's sweet boy is a little shaken. Hopefully a hearty meal and a nice, long chin scratch will settle his nerves, yes?\n\nYou have this one's deepest thanks, walker. Milksop's too! Say thank you, sweet boy! Go ahead, now. Oh, never mind!"
"116521668-0-13638";"I do not know. I must reflect on this.\n\nStill, I thank you for all that you've done. You saved my companions, found my egg-mother's research, and helped the oasis begin to heal. No small feats to accomplish, traveler-friend."
"116521668-0-13640";"Yes. This one will stay. But I will not lie about what happened here. Silhu-jo made an impossible choice, but the people deserve to hear the truth.\n\nThank you, walker. We only just met, but you are the closest thing to family that Vazbi has left."
"116521668-0-13641";"Yes, you are right. Silhu-jo was a good Khajiit, but I cannot live within these walls knowing that we denied their security to people in desperate need.\n\nThank you, walker. We only just met, but you are the closest thing to family that I have left."
"116521668-0-13645";"The war is far from over. Even a queen needs to consult with such learned personages as Gharesh-ri and Abnur Tharn every now and then.\n\nTake this in recognition of your efforts on our behalf, five-claw. Then talk to Gharesh-ri. I need … to think."
"116521668-0-13647";"Gharesh-ri has already gone to the Moon Gate of Anequina to take charge of the forces there. We will join him shortly.\n\nThank you for helping with my attunement, five-claw. With you and my ancestors beside me, we will find a way to stop the Dragons."
"116521668-0-13653";"For now, help the Khajiiti prepare for the Dragon invasion. And take this as recompense for your service.\n\nIn the meantime, I have plans to formulate and arrangements to make. When the moment to deal with the Dragons comes, I will contact you."
"116521668-0-13659";"The Morag Tong isn't one to leave loose threads, even one that's been dangling for over a century. Luckily for Feina-Darak, my grandfather was able to complete his writ.\n\nHere, a reward for services rendered."
"116521668-0-13664";"Now Tasnasi is home and you enjoy her hospitality. Raise a mug, kick up your feet, and count your coin.\n\nThere is much to be done to fix the damage Khasda did, but that is for Tasnasi to worry about. Your work is done, even if hers is just beginning."
"116521668-0-13665";"Now we go our separate ways. Take Tasnasi's advice: leave the Stitches before it falls apart completely. \n\nThis one has no great sum of wealth, but she owes you something for saving her skin. Unlike most in these parts, Tasnasi remembers her friends."
"116521668-0-13674";"Of course, of course! Your share, as promised. After all, Mizzik would never have been able to solve this investigation without your aid.\n\nPleasure working with you, walker. Do not be a stranger, yes?"
"116521668-0-13683";"Ah, the Akaviri spirit has blessed you. Kiseravi can tell. How else would you have succeeded where Kiseravi has failed?\n\nPlease accept this gift. And the spirit's blessings."
"116521668-0-13693";"Kra! I never should have given you that head start! Now what will Sarazi hunt? Birds and chipmunks?\n\nWell, a wager is a wager, yes? Here. Spend it on some decent food, walker. Bulging muscles and a shiny coat start at the dinner table! Farewell."
"116521668-0-13697";"Ah, indeed you do! The Gorger of Glenumbra, captured once more! Its bestial intellect swayed by the promise of grisly table scraps!\n\nZiss'vo, could you work with me here? It's part of the mystique. Just take your gold and act astounded, all right?"
"116521668-0-13699";"I cannot be named queen without the Mane's blessing. That, however, is my worry.\n\nFor now, you should rest. We must honor our fallen and learn the fate of our troops at the Moon Gate. And after that, we will celebrate a new dawn for Elsweyr."
"116521668-0-13700";"There's nothing left for me here. We couldn't save my clan from doom, but I am grateful for all you've done.\n\nAs are the caravanners. They've scrounged this up, as thanks."
"116521668-0-13701";"Then you have this one's gratitude.\n\nAnd the gratitude of Azurah as well, it seems. Just as Mazdurr was leaving, he happened to find something of value. Take it as your well earned reward."
"116521668-0-13704";"Very good. Zahari will make sure these gems are distributed among our enchanters. When this one has more gems to fill, she will let you know."
"116521668-0-13709";"Rajhin's Shadow? I … I'll be honest. That's a lot to take in. But after all you've done for us, how can I not offer you the benefit of the doubt? \n\nFeel free to place any mural pieces that you find. And here, something for your troubles."
"116521668-0-13710";"Well, I suspect his involvement had much more to do with you than the mural itself.\n\nFeel free to visit the House of Histories anytime you wish, free of charge. And here, a gift for your many troubles."
"116521668-0-13711";"And only more to come, this one fears.\n\nBefore you leave, you should speak to Zamarak. It seems that he's also decided to leave us. Perhaps he can help guide you to your next location."
"116521668-0-13712";"Whatever wards the disciples of this temple put in place to keep Arum-Khal bound are failing, and it's unlikely we'll find the means to mend them. \n\nWe'll have to deal with this threat head on. For that, I need your help."
"116521668-0-13713";"The Moonlight Blade, eh? And I assume this spirit bound himself to the sword somehow? Fascinating.\n\nWith this blade, and a wise spirit guiding us, we finally have a real chance at defeating Arum-Khal. Well done, my friend."
"116521668-0-13714";"I think I'll stay here a while. The adepts of the Hidden Moon still have a great deal to teach us, it seems.\n\nAs for you, the Moonlight Blade remains in your care. Wield it justly, and never forget what we accomplished here. Azura guide you, friend."
"116521668-0-13721";"Ah, yes. Mother's docile screeching can lull Raz to sleep.\n\nNow, this one suspects that Mother would try to cheat you if you asked her for payment. So here, a reward from Raz's own pockets. Aren't you a lucky one?"
"116521668-0-13722";"A senche tiger? That's remarkable! If he managed that, a frog should present no challenge at all!\n\nThank you so much, walker. When I publish about this, I'll be sure to mention your contribution. Ha! I can't wait to see the look on Caldathir's face!"

"116521668-0-13731";"You appeared when Elsweyr needed you most. In our most desperate time of troubles, you helped restore our nation. You will always have a place here, my friend.\n\nAnd I want you to accept the greatest award I can offer. I name you Champion of Anequina!"
"116521668-0-13732";"Let us pray the lesson takes, for soon they must face the might of Dragons.\n\nYour aid in this matter is most appreciated. This one hopes you will continue to provide such a demonstration for the many recruits to come."

"116521668-0-13746";"It is not for her to decide. If Khajiit lost their faith in her, she would not be surprised. This one will beg forgiveness for her failings and accept the will of her clowder. She was too reliant on her gifts and a leader must be more than a prophet."
"116521668-0-13772";"A parley? I may not like her, but we are family. Besides, it would give the Khajiit time to regroup. You're beginning to think like a Tharn, my friend.\n\nHere, take this. Gharesh-ri gave it to me, but I refuse to accept payment for my services."
"116521668-0-13777";"Good. Good. I couldn't leave until I knew ….\n\nYou did well, comrade. Better than Morgane and I, at any rate. You would have liked her, I think. Hmm. Here's your pay. The Fighters Guild, and all of Blackwood, thank you for your efforts."
"116521668-0-13785";"For now, recover your strength and prepare yourself. Euraxia's forces will arrive soon and we'll need you ready for the battle to come.\n\nAnd here, take this. Gharesh-ri keeps handing me pouches, but I have little use for Khajiiti gold."
"116521668-0-13790";"As promised, your reward. \n\nWe appreciate your help. Here's a little something for the effort."
"116521668-0-13800";"Zahari hopes they take such a lesson to heart. Our needs are great and the time to train is frightfully little to prepare against this Dragon invasion.\n\nThank you for your help on this matter."
"116521668-0-13801";"Hopefully, such a lesson has taught our recruits much. Their hearts may be brave, but it is their skill that will decide our battles against the Dragons.\n\nZahari is most grateful for your aid, warrior."
"116521668-0-13802";"Today they watch a warrior at work. Tomorrow, they face the mighty threat of the Dragons who threaten us. And thanks to you, they are a little more prepared for such a fight.\n\nYou have this one's gratitude, warrior."
"116521668-0-13803";"This one hopes our recruits have taken your demonstration most seriously. Each lesson learned is worth much in these troubling times of Dragons and mayhem.\n\nYou have aided us greatly, warrior. You have Zahari's thanks."
"116521668-0-13805";"Excellent work. It will take our scholars time to decipher the writing, but Zahari has no doubt it will prove useful in the battles ahead.\n\nNo enemy is invulnerable, not even Dragons. This scroll proves that."
"116521668-0-13806";"And so we gain another arrow in our quiver. Thank Jone and Jode.\n\nAnd thank you as well, warrior. Zahari has a feeling that this scroll will prove more than useful, once our scholars decipher it."
"116521668-0-13807";"Your work is most appreciated, warrior. Anything we can learn about the Dragons is a closer step to victory.\n\nThis one will notify our scholars immediately. They will want to start their studies."
"116521668-0-13808";"Excellent! Please, speak to my associates and they'll help you get started.\n\nHere's a small retainer to keep your interest. Generous, yes? Ha! Good hunting, walker."
"116521668-0-13809";"There will always be some who are willing to choose risk over reason, but for now this threat has passed.\n\nTake this, along with my gratitude."
"116521668-0-13810";"That Hollowfang alchemy got the Dragonguard's blood boiling, eh? Defeating Grundwulf at the height of his bloodlust must've been a glorious battle alright. \n\nGets me flush just thinking about it. Might give you more than a key next time you swing by."
"116521668-0-13811";"Well, it's not like you killed the Dragon. But you killed everyone who did kill it, so next best thing. Slaying the Dragonguard and his vampire cohort merits a key.\n\nNow go wash the taste of blood out of your mouth with some ale."
"116521668-0-13812";"Turning Moongrave into a graveyard is worthy of reward. Put it toward some silver boot caps for the next time you run roughshod over a bunch of bloodsuckers."
"116521668-0-13814";"Here. This was a gift from King Camoran. It's yours now. Payment in kind. With some gratitude on the house."
"116521668-0-13815";"Bet you thought you had a nice cozy pledge before the Dragon turned Selene against you. Not just anyone could have faced down Maarselok and the Changeling at the same time. Selene better behave, eh?\n\nTake your reward, Undaunted. You earned it."
"116521668-0-13816";"You fulfilled your pledge, even if you had help from a vengeful nature spirit. Can't say I wouldn't enjoy beating a Dragon like a festival effigy given the opportunity. Just give the next one a fighting chance.\n\nHere's your key and cut."
"116521668-0-13817";"Killing a Dragon's worth bragging about, even with Selene's help. From what I heard it'd already killed an army of Wood Elves before you arrived. They'll be cheering your name all over Grahtwood for slaying that monster."
"116521668-0-13819";"Only through your works and your devotion. Were it not for you, this one would still blindly follow a false god.\n\nAzin-jo is not fit to give you Alkosh's blessings, but they are all he has to offer. May the Great Cat keep your path true."
"116521668-0-13820";"This one would not have seen if he had not been guided by wiser walkers. You have the bravery and heart of the old heroes who fought the White Snake on this mountain. Alkosh smiles on you, and so do we all. Take these offerings for your true faith!"
"116521668-0-13821";"Only because Alkosh sent a miracle to set things right. You blessed champions cast down the false gods with such vengeance that this one wonders if the Dragon King of Cats did not strike the blows himself!\n\nWe offer you all the thanks we have."
"116521668-0-13822";"Teeth from the great blasphemer's mouth. We will keep them as reminders of the victory you won today in the name of the Great Cat.\n\nThis temple will honor you and this day forever more."
"116521668-0-13823";"Teeth from the great blasphemer's mouth. We will keep them as reminders of the victory you won today in the name of the Great Cat.\n\nWe honor this great deed done in Alkosh's name! Take this with our gratitude."
"116521668-0-13824";"The golden liar's tongue. Ensuring it never again speaks its blasphemy is a fitting tribute to Alkosh! We will keep it as proof of your great deed, and the fate of those who would profane our worship of the Great Cat!\n\nTake this with our blessing."
"116521668-0-13825";"Then present yourself to our bishop, Azin-jo. With his blessing, you may proceed into the temple grounds and have your audience with the Divine."
"116521668-0-13828";"The old ghost was royalty? If Saviwa had that treasure, he would have never had to work a day in his life. Oh, well. Saviwa will find another way to be lazy.\n\nTake this for your efforts. It's no royal treasure, but it's the best Saviwa has to give."
"116521668-0-13843";"Yes, Nisuzi can smell your victory from here! Sulfur, oil, and buckets of Daedra blood, yes?\n\nThis one cannot thank you enough, walker. A Baandari who cannot travel by night is no true Baandari. Please, take this, with our thanks."
"116521668-0-13846";"Or they wanted to keep it out of the hands of cruel, Daedra worshiping conquerors—not that the Dwemer were exactly saints themselves. If it was dangerous at one time, it's nothing more than inert stone now. A priceless lump of inert stone."
"116521668-0-13847";"Or they simply wanted to keep the Wrathstone for themselves. We don't know their reasons, yet, but this could be the key to understanding why.\n\nWhatever its history, the Wrathstone's just a lump of inert stone now. A priceless lump of inert stone."
"116521668-0-13848";"Wonderful! Here's a reward for all of your hard work, my valiant friend!\n\nCheck back with me each day. These Dragons won't keep themselves in check."
"116521668-0-13850";"Fantastic! Let me know when you're ready to become an official follower. All you need to do is constantly praise Peryite and contract a terrible illness. I'll be more than happy to cough on you.\n\nFor now, please accept this gift."
"116521668-0-13852";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-13857";"Would a fool live in constant sickness to prove his devotion? Would he travel Tamriel with an idiot in a hopeless attempt to convince others to do the same? It sounds worse when I say it out loud ….\n\nIn any case, I owe you. Please accept this gift."
"116521668-0-13865";"Bright Moons! Our friends in the adeptoriums will drop their sugar-rolls when they see these.\n\nNow, a good deed deserves good pay, yes? Here you go, walker. Come back soon!"
"116521668-0-13867";"Ah, well done, walker! Hand them to me, quickly. Holding these too long can make you dizzy. Nisuzi found out the hard way when she stole … borrowed them from her Aunt Sihada.\n\nNow, your reward, as promised! Walk with Baan Dar, friend!"
"116521668-0-13869";"Yes, Nisuzi smells the blood on you. If this does not get the Hungry Cat's attention, I do not know what will!\n\nYou have our gratitude, walker. Khenarthi's breezes keep you safe!"
"116521668-0-13871";"This is fabulous news! Nisuzi thinks it may take some time for the last of the minotaurs to move on, but the snake-men's treasures are not going anywhere!\n\nPlease, take this, walker. And the blessings of a grateful clan!"
"116521668-0-13877";"Ah, yes! Nisuzi can smell its citrusy aroma from here! Finally, we can stop sipping that pine-needle swill my uncle makes. Thank Baan Dar.\n\nAnd thank you, walker! Take this. You earned it, yes?"
"116521668-0-13879";"The keg must have dropped out of our wagon. Which is a little odd, given that my husband should have been sitting right by it.\n\nAh, well, no harm done. And here's a reward for your troubles. Not sure what we would do if we lost this beauty!"
"116521668-0-13881";"No tricks this time. One way or the other, I need to settle things with Tu'heiba. Otherwise, I'll never have any peace.\n\nTake this for your trouble, eh? Assuming Tu'heiba doesn't kill me, you should join us for drinks! Thanks again, good looking."
"116521668-0-13888";"Then the King of Thieves was watching over you! Let's see, let's see … ah, yes this will do. Yes, yes, yes. Fine offerings for Rajhin.\n\nDo not forget yourself when dividing spoils or Rajhin will think you a fool. Good thieves always take their cut."
"116521668-0-13899";"Cake? I don't know. This one came out so well, I might just keep it for myself.\n\nJust kidding! You earned this special cake. Wait until you taste it! I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised."
"116521668-0-13902";"A collar and bell made to fit Rigurt's rippling neck? Rigurt will jingle it with pride!\n\nPlease accept this gift, friend. Rigurt could not have made peace between the Nords and Khajiit without you."
"116521668-0-13907";"Ah! Confusion and guilt are my bread and butter! Madness is my cheese! Moral fortitude is my melon-chevre salad! If I wasn't immortal, I would be starving right now!\n\nWe're done here! Get out! Happy head exploding!"
"116521668-0-13913";"Ah, Sanzagh. We established this farm together, but things got strange when Hadamnargo bought his horse. I think he was jealous, but I never felt comfortable riding on something that talked back.\n\nPlease accept this gift for everything you've done."
"116521668-0-13919";"My master is a connoisseur of cursed collectables. Wine. Jewelry. Paintings. People.\n\nHere is your reward. If you find more cursed items, please bring them here. I still hope that if his collection grows large enough, he'll no longer need me in it."
"116521668-0-13921";"Excellent. Here's your reward. But … huh. Were these scrolls scribbled on when you found them? Looks like someone stabbed them with ink and profanity.\n\nAh, wait, does vandalism of sacred Goutfang property make you a pariah? I'll chew on that."
"116521668-0-13924";"Ha! Well done, five-claw. Well done! Old Ri'hirr only hopes she stays dead.\n\nThank you for this. Here is your reward. Well earned, yes? Yes."
"116521668-0-13926";"Spotless work, walker! With that overgrown buzzard dealt with, the sugar traders can resume their caravans. Thank Alkosh for that! Old Ri'hirr hates an unsweetened meal.\n\nYou will take this and our thanks, yes? Yes."
"116521668-0-13934";"Good! We can only hope that she will remain dead this time, yes? Old Ri'hirr is tired of foes getting back up all the time!\n\nHere's your payment. Be well, five-claw."
"116521668-0-13937";"And you brought them back? Well, that's just … wow. Why don't you just lay them down there, five-claw. Old Ri'hirr will call an adept to collect them. Very soon.\n\nNow, I'm glad to hear you settled this business. Please, take this and my thanks."
"116521668-0-13940";"Well done, five-claw! Now, Elsweyr's merchants finally have a chance to breathe!\n\nYou will take this for your trouble, yes? Strong will and good hunting."
"116521668-0-13944";"Moons be praised! Necromancers should be scrawny and clever, or musclebound and stupid. Musclebound and clever is just unfair, yes?\n\nHere is your reward. Many thanks, five-claw."
"116521668-0-13949";"Excellent work! Knowing you were on the job eased my mind a little.\n\nCome back tomorrow. I'll have more Dragons to hunt for you."
"116521668-0-13960";"This means a lot. Really. I don't have much left to remember him by. The things in this pack, and the condolences of the legion paymaster every month when I collect his due.\n\nTake the gold. I don't need it. You've more than earned it."
"116521668-0-13968";"<Nailed to the bounty board is a scrawled note from General Khamagash:>\n\n""When you've killed your quota of enemy Necromancers, take your reward."""
"116521668-0-13969";"<Attached to the bounty board is a message from General Dar-Liurz:>\n\n""Your prowess in hunting enemy Necromancers has gained you great renown. On behalf of Grand Warlord Zimmeron, I leave this reward for your efforts."""
"116521668-0-13970";"<Pinned to the bounty board is a note from General Thoron:>\n\n""I received word of your success in slaying enemy Necromancers, soldier. Accept this bonus pay. It has been well-earned!"""
"116521668-0-13976";"And we'll find that way. Somehow. For now, rest. Prepare yourself.\n\nAnd take this for your efforts. Remember, you confirmed Kaalgrontiid's plan and removed Dragonhold's protection. We're one step closer to ending this, my friend."
"116521668-0-13977";"I do, but first I have something for you. I found it in the sanctum's treasury.\n\nBut let's keep this between us. If a certain smuggling crew knew we had a treasury, they'd empty it faster than Za'ji can drain a bottle of plum brandy."
"116521668-0-13978";"Those who risk nothing inadvertently risk it all. Either we face this single Dragon to gain a Dragonhorn, or we face a horde without such a weapon at our side.\n\nBut what's risk without reward? Here's something for the aid you provided thus far."
"116521668-0-13985";"There are few more deserving to walk the Sands Behind the Stars. Though you might count among them.\n\nTake this, with all our gratitude. This one hopes we cross paths in happier times."
"116521668-0-13987";"Whatever it is, we'll be ready for it. For now though, I owe you a debt as well. Without your help, the Dragonguard would never have been reborn. We succeeded beyond my expectations. Take this. And know that there will always be a place for you here."
"116521668-0-13992";"I must train with the Dragonhorn and prepare for what lies ahead. And so must you, warrior. \n\nWhen the time comes, I will call for your aid. Together, we shall fight back against the Dragons and drive them from Elsweyr. This, I swear to you."
"116521668-0-13996";"Then we must do everything in our power to stop them. \n\nThank you for taking this risk, my friend. Through your actions, we know where the cult plans to strike next. Here, another treasure from the sanctum's stores. You've certainly earned it."
"116521668-0-13998";"We also need to learn more about this Dragon, Laatvulon. If it does indeed wish to destroy all of Tamriel, then an alliance is our best way to end that threat.\n\nI'm just glad I have your support in this. Your help has already been invaluable."
"116521668-0-14000";"Wherever Sormund takes us, yes? After years of waking to the same nightmare, Daini could do with a surprise or two.\n\nSpeaking of nightmares, thank you for ridding Daini of hers. Knowing that Turo lies dead … it lightens the soul. Farewell, walker."
"116521668-0-14002";"Pomp and circumstance are a necessary component of every ceremony. The masses demand it!\n\nBesides, I want to honor the Dragonguard's accomplishments, yours included. Take this reward and smile, five-claw. We are about to begin!"
"116521668-0-14009";"By my honor, that's good to hear. With Ra'khajin slain and the mask in our possession, we're much closer to victory. And it's all because of your efforts.\n\nHere, take this. Another interesting item I found in the sanctum's vaults."
"116521668-0-14010";"Not yet. We defeated Laatvulon, but I sense another power lurking in Elsweyr. Something dark that threatens to disrupt my father's order. When the time comes for you to face it, I shall aid you. I give you my word.\n\nAnd keep the mask. It suits you."
"116521668-0-14012";"That's more like it. Has to be far more interesting than interpreting fifty-six poses of katana kata. Next time bring a katana. Least then I can try them out.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-14015";"That's a shield? Hmm, hand it over. Hey, this didn't hold up so bad. Yeah, there's Akaviri engravings on it. Bet it'll clean up real good.\n\nHere's your gold. I'll yell when I got more work for you."
"116521668-0-14018";"Bebbia looks forward to it. Rest assured, her gratitude knows no bounds. And the Khajiiti people, as well. Every tapestry fragment you find restores a little more of our history.\n\nThank you so much, my friend."
"116521668-0-14026";"Same as always, I guess. Keep wandering. Keep working. Sword arm's healing up. I wager there's plenty of gold around here for a thick-headed Orc.\n\nPleasure working with you, pal. Let's do this again some time. Just without the kidnapping bit. Ha!"
"116521668-0-14027";"Excellent. I'll meet with him and his crew to discuss the particulars.\n\nFor aiding me in the establishment of our new Dragonguard, accept this reward. Oh, and talk to Nahfahlaar when you have a moment. He requested your help with a small matter."
"116521668-0-14043";"S'rendarr's salty tears, yes! This sanctuary is safe again. Someone will still need to strong-arm these smugglers into shoving off, but Moonlit Cove will survive.\n\nTake this as Shazar's show of support! May Jone and Jode shower you with succor."
"116521668-0-14067";"Zhasim and Winks are going to become the traders they always knew they could be. I'm going to ask my uncle to let Maezi and me open a trade route between Orsinium and Senchal! If Maezi is willing, of course.\n\nHere, friend. For all your help. Thanks!"
"116521668-0-14072";"Well, I'm going to make my way back to Windhelm. If these hags and their sisters on the mainland really intend to make a play for Skyrim, the Skald-King needs to know.\n\nAs for you? I'd say get in out of the cold. And take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14073";"Slaying witches like that is tough under the best circumstances. But when they're at their peak? I'd say it was impossible if you weren't standing here as living proof.\n\nWell done! Here's your key."
"116521668-0-14074";"Those witches didn't know what hit them. Taking out a whole coven and their allies is no mean feat. Here is your reward."
"116521668-0-14075";"If the full might of the Icereach Coven wasn't enough to stop you then I'm not sure what will! Here's your key. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14077";"You are right, of course. Even at my best, I could not hope to match a foe like that. Let alone the creature he summoned or the patron who sent him here—whoever that is.\n\nThe Pyre Watch will always be in your debt, wayfarer. Tu'whacca bless you."
"116521668-0-14078";"Well, I'm glad I'm no graverobber! To slay a whole mess of necromancers and their monsters while their leader's dander is up? Whoa. That takes real courage.\n\nHere's your key. You earned it!"
"116521668-0-14079";"A whole horde of graverobbers slain, and a bone monster banished? I'd say that more than earns you a key. Well done."
"116521668-0-14080";"You really gave those graverobbers what for! I bet they'll tell stories about you for a long time—the few that survived, I mean.\n\nHere's your key. Well done."
"116521668-0-14082";"I should really get some sleep, but with all that's happened I don't know how I could manage it. Secrets from my mother's past, a father I never knew …. It's a lot to take in.\n\nIn any event, thank you so much for all your efforts. Eight bless you."
"116521668-0-14089";"So you did! And just look at them. Majestic, eh? These would look splendid on my shelf next to all those other books I never bothered to read. Alas, they're not mine to keep. I will deliver them to my client straight away.\n\nAnd now, your reward!"
"116521668-0-14091";"A wise choice, walker! Very wise indeed. Please, speak to any of my friends here. They will get you started on the path to coin and adventure!\n\nAh, Tsaraba almost forgot! Take this small retainer. To whet the appetite, yes? Ha! Farewell!"
"116521668-0-14094";"Huh. Springmint smells nice. Might want some for myself. Bet it soothes aches, and I've got plenty of those.\n\nAnyway, you helped our forces by gathering this stuff for the healers, so thanks. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-14096";"Well done. Although, come to think of it, I can't stand rice either. It feels like little maggots in my mouth. Maybe it's just the cook we have.\n\nAppreciate your help. Here's a little something for the effort."
"116521668-0-14098";"Just in time. One of the mages came by to check on this. Claims this dust can reveal the past through visions if you drink it in a potion. I think the mage has already had too much to drink.\n\nThanks. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-14100";"Glad you fared better than that scholar. And you have the notes. I'll let the friends know. Plus give them an earful about taking armed folk on their little field trips next time.\n\nThanks. Here's something for the effort."
"116521668-0-14102";"You've done us all a great favor. That blasted guardian has plagued unwary travelers for a while now. Not sure why it's still so protective of that place.\n\nThanks … and here's your reward!"
"116521668-0-14105";"<A scrap of paper is pinned to the crate.>\n\n""Thank you for your timely delivery. You saved me some embarrassment already. Please keep my arrangement with Alyxe from reaching Master Rolis's ears. We need not scandalize him."" —Faustina Curio"
"116521668-0-14107";"Now we're talking. I mean, it's an expression. I'm not just narrating what's hap—forget it. If we're lucky, these papers will tell us what the New Moons are planning.\n\nI'm giving you this gold for a job well done. Dammit."
"116521668-0-14108";"Phew. Guess the Dark Elves did bury them with it. You just been lugging it around like that? You're as bad as Za'ji.\n\nI won't dock you anything for leaving it to me to clean up, just this once. Here's your pay."
"116521668-0-14110";"Haha! Earned our pay with this one! Would you look at that? Even got pictures. The old beard is gonna love it.\n\nGo on and take your pay. I need to show Sai all the important work I—we—been doing."
"116521668-0-14111";"Excellent! Just place them, you know … over there. I'll make sure my client comes to collect them directly. Can't have things like this lying about. Not that they're … you're feeling all right, yes? Never mind.\n\nHere's your payment, as promised!"
"116521668-0-14113";"Excellent! Perhaps I'll purchase a few of those candles for my cottage. My wife insists it's haunted. Honestly, I'm just too cheap to replace the creaky floorboards. Guybert is nothing if not frugal!\n\nIn any event, take this with my compliments!"
"116521668-0-14115";"Really? Was it half as boring as it sounds? Can't be more boring than going through these manifests you brought. What if they put me to sleep and Vaermina comes for me? Nah, nah, that's crazy ….\n\nUh, here's your gold. I'm gonna go switch to coffee."
"116521668-0-14116";"Good. May Namiira drag them to the darkness where they belong.\n\nTake this as payment, walker. Just know that more Dragons will come. Return tomorrow, yes? Tomorrow's Dragons will die as surely as today's."
"116521668-0-14118";"Good. May Namiira drag them to the darkness where they belong.\n\nTake this as payment, walker. Just know that more Dragons will come. Return tomorrow, yes? Tomorrow's Dragons will die as surely as today's."
"116521668-0-14122";"Excellent! Always a welcome change of pace when success is measured in flowers planted rather than skulls cloven, yes? I digress.\n\nHere is your reward, my friend. Spend it in good health!"
"116521668-0-14124";"Ah, yes. I can smell them from here. Gracious, that smell. Haven't confronted an aroma like that since my days in the dung-business. What? There's a lot of gold to be made in dung! A story for another time, I suppose.\n\nHere's your fee. Farewell!"
"116521668-0-14126";"Well, I won't bother you for the details. The less I know the better. I have enough trouble sleeping at night, what with my wife's snoring.\n\nTake this with my compliments. With any luck, my client will develop a skooma treatment soon."
"116521668-0-14129";"<A scrap of paper is pinned to the crate.>\n\n""I appreciate your quick and discreet delivery. Master Rolis need not know of this, of course. He isn't quite as open-minded as the rest of us. Enjoy your reward!"" —Faustina Curio"
"116521668-0-14139";"Well look at that. No wonder I misplaced these. That last batch I made must have been particularly potent.\n\nI'm sorry, stranger, but I won't be able to make enough for you to see the sand-whales. Take this instead, with my thanks."
"116521668-0-14141";"Yes, yes, give Tender Claw here. Stupid little thief! Always striking off on his own when we're supposed to work together.\n\nThis one supposes she should give you a reward. No matter. She will find a way to get it back from you later, yes?"
"116521668-0-14143";"<A parcel awaits you as reward for your battle prowess.>"
"116521668-0-14145";"I'll drop this stone in the deepest lake or river I can find. Put it where it won't hurt anyone else.\n\nBut here, take this, please. You went out of your way to inform me of my beloved's fate. The Moons thank you, walker, and so do I."
"116521668-0-14153";"That's Falls' all right. She loved this ring. I'll make sure her family gets it when we're back home in Murkmire.\n\nAnyway, thank you. Why don't you take this. For your efforts. I just wish it could be more."
"116521668-0-14156";"I'd like to think so, but it feels like Senchal is determined to destroy any kindness that lurks within its walls.\n\nPlease accept this payment, and some additional gold for your efficiency. Perhaps we can work together again in the future."
"116521668-0-14164";"I'd like to think so, but it feels like this city is determined to destroy any kindness that lurks within its walls.\n\nHere's your payment. You could have saved those people some pain if you had been faster, but you helped them nonetheless."
"116521668-0-14166";"That is a first then. Usually when she stumbles home after a few nights out there is a trail of destruction that follows.\n\nTake some gold for your trouble. And dump her out, walker, the little troublemaker doesn't deserve your pity."
"116521668-0-14167";"<He notes your work and tenders payment.>"
"116521668-0-14169";"<He notes your work and tenders payment.>"
"116521668-0-14171";"<He notes your work and tenders payment.>"
"116521668-0-14188";"Good. We'll make a proper hunter out of you yet. Here's a little something for fetching those bones for me. Maybe buy yourself a satchel so you don't get Dragon guts seeping into your bedroll."
"116521668-0-14191";"Then we must do everything in our power to stop the attack. \n\nThanks to your efforts, my friend, we now know where the cult plans to strike next. Here, take this treasure from the sanctum's stores. You certainly earned it."
"116521668-0-14192";"A vampire? Working with the coven? That would explain the strange bloodfiends in the Ratway. We'll worry about that later. Right now, we have to get to Eastmarch and find that witch.\n\nOh, before we leave, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14196";"That's true. And we stopped that storm. My investigations have led to even darker corners, but progress has been made.\n\nHere. Consider this a stipend from Ravenwatch. For your valuable assistance, of course. Now, let's get out of here."
"116521668-0-14200";"Not everything is as grim as it appears. We did create an elixir. That's our best chance of protecting the people from the harrowstorm. We just need to distribute it.\n\nIn the meantime, take this. It may not seem like much, but you earned it."
"116521668-0-14202";"Looks that way, thanks to you. With any luck we might even be able to salvage the Cormorant. She's a fine ship.\n\nPlease, take this. I wish I had more to give."
"116521668-0-14203";"I don't know, truly. Freiwen's return will raise many questions in Morthal. The jarl and I must discuss what to say. If we say anything at all about what happened here.\n\nI promised you payment at the beginning of this. Here. I'm deeply grateful."
"116521668-0-14204";"I thought as much. But thanks to you, my people are safe.\n\nI will not let your help go to waste, nor will I let this tragedy sour the dream Skor and I created here. Take this. We don't have much to offer, but we will never forget what you did for us."
"116521668-0-14214";"No, but we saved Morthal and stopped the coven from getting the gray reliquaries at Karthwatch. And we brought the hold leaders here. All of that matters.\n\nTake this. My royal allowance. I was going to buy wine, but you can make better use of it."
"116521668-0-14216";"Now we celebrate our victory and let Jorunn's scouts do what they do best. Meanwhile, I'll work with the Skald-King to figure out how to approach Svargrim with this news.\n\nIn the meantime, take this. You earned it. I'll be in touch soon."
"116521668-0-14220";"First, on behalf of Western Skyrim, take this with my thanks. We would have been lost without you. Then rest. Check on our friends. Injuries must be tended to, buildings repaired. Other wounds … will take longer.\n\nWe'll have more to do soon enough."
"116521668-0-14231";"I'll work with our remaining priests. Try to use the relic to purge the corruption and seal the temple. If that doesn't work … well, let's hope that it does.\n\nThank you, my friend. You stood with us while Meridia turned away. We won't forget that."
"116521668-0-14240";"And I can't wait to hear all the details. In the meantime, let's take a look at what you found and try to devise a plan. Lyris didn't say much, but she indicated that time is short.\n\nHere, take this. You deserve a lot more, but it's all I can spare."
"116521668-0-14243";"Reach witches summoning magical storms to create feral vampires? That's horrible, but to what purpose? Well, that's the next puzzle to solve. First, we need to get this information to the queen.\n\nHere. This was for Brondold, but it's yours now."
"116521668-0-14245";"Shor's bones. Reachmen are stubborn, so they may come after her again. Fenrar and I will see these people to safety. The hold is gone, but we can protect our family.\n\nThanks again. Take this, and be careful out there. Dark times surround us."
"116521668-0-14254";"Of course it will be! We will use the instruments, too. They should be revered yes, but used for special occasions. \n\nBut first, more instruments! You'll have expenses. Let me weigh you down with some gold before you go."
"116521668-0-14260";"Take this. Call it a keepsake for everything you've done for House Ravenwatch. And for me.\n\nThe vampiric threat still looms large here in Skyrim, but with Essenia out of the way, I think we've got a fighting chance."
"116521668-0-14261";"She's strong, she will be fine. Anyway, it was an honor to work with you. If you ever find yourself tangled in the world of spirits again, I do hope you'll seek us out. \n\nHere, take this for your time. You undoubtedly deserve it."
"116521668-0-14269";"Excellent. Hopefully after all this trouble, we can convince Solitude to make our lives a little easier. \n\nThank you, friend. Your actions likely saved the western holds. I promise you, your triumph will not go unsung."
"116521668-0-14271";"Then my odds of getting off this rock without being incinerated are looking much better. My employer should be pleased as well.\n\nHere's your cut of my pay. I should subcontract more often."
"116521668-0-14273";"I'll take them to a temple for consecration and see that he gets a proper burial. It won't be a jarl's funeral, but hopefully it'll allow him to reach Sovngarde.\n\nThen I can finally get some rest. You've spared us both. Thank you."
"116521668-0-14276";"That's horrible! But there must be more to this than simply turning my people into monsters.\n\nWell, I'll do what I can to help you. Mother would have wanted me to. What you've done and discovered will be enough to convince my father. It has to be."
"116521668-0-14287";"I'll give him the burial he seeks, so we can both finally get some rest, but it'll be an unmarked grave. His name can stay buried down here. Call it mercy, not forgiveness.\n\nBut at least I won't join him. I never could have done this without you."
"116521668-0-14290";"None of us would be here to sing dirges for the dead or celebrate the living if not for you. I certainly wouldn't be here, ready to lead my hold.\n\nYou've supported me since I started down this path. I'm honored to have you here at the end."
"116521668-0-14291";"I used my wits, my faithful dog, and my grappling hook to rescue those who needed rescuing, and made it back in one piece! Best of all, I made a new friend. It was everything I hoped for and more!\n\nHere, take this as a token of my appreciation."
"116521668-0-14302";"Good! I spoke with my fellow bards and we are in agreement. The instruments shall stay on display and every year we will host a celebration of their return. This way everyone can play and hear them.\n\nI reserved the Seat of Honor for you. Enjoy!"
"116521668-0-14305";"I'm inclined to agree.\n\nThulsgreg always argues in favor of tradition. The Code of Malacath demands repayment in blood. Without discipline and accountability, this stronghold falls apart. Thank you. Please, take this as a token of our friendship."

"116521668-0-14332";"You make a good point. \n\nI need to show my clan that I don't just offer a new approach to mining. I offer a new approach to what life in the clan means. And that starts now—with mercy. Thank you. Please, take this as a token of our friendship."

"116521668-0-14337";"Oh my, these aren't like anything I've seen before. Doesn't look terribly Goblin to me, but that's for Landal to determine. Either way, the existence of undiscovered peoples is quite an accomplishment. We're most pleased. Most pleased!"
"116521668-0-14339";"Splendid! Aren't the state of these just fascinating? They've been stored for centuries, but they look as fresh as those you'd find in a bowl of Valenwood stew.\n\nHere's your payment. Well done!"
"116521668-0-14343";"No, Nel … why'd you choose them? What'd they ever do to deserve you?\n\nThank you for bringing me this. For letting me know. It's worth what little the Frostbite left me."
"116521668-0-14350";"I can't even begin to understand what just happened, but I think we have you to thank for keeping us from being tossed around all of creation with no rhyme or reason.\n\nOnce the room stops spinning, we're leaving. Even if I have to carry Raynor out."
"116521668-0-14355";"Yes, darling, thanks to you. My rather enviable body is restored and those sorry excuse for cultists no longer have a hold of me. \n\nPlease, take this. It's not every hero that stops to help a talking doll. You've more than earned a reward."
"116521668-0-14358";"Wonderful! Now my experiment can continue without interruption. You make a fine assistant, I'm glad my trust in you was not misplaced. \n\nPlease, take this as an expression of my gratitude. You've more than earned it."
"116521668-0-14366";"I will fulfill my grandfather's wish and take up the mantle he entrusted to me. Morokei must never be allowed to escape this tomb.\n\nI learned a great deal watching you fight. When the time comes again, I will be ready. Thank you for everything."
"116521668-0-14375";"Rigurt is as ready as ever! Of course, King Jorunn told Rigurt not say anything during the meeting, so mostly he is ready to nod. And smile!\n\nYou have been such a good friend to Rigurt. Take this, with his thanks!"
"116521668-0-14384";"Aye, Lord Falgravn's forces are in full retreat. The few you left alive, anyway! We'll rid ourselves of the rest within the hour.\n\nThis tale would have had a very different ending if you and your allies hadn't shown up. Thank you, my friend."

"116521668-0-14387";"Shor's bones! Don't have to be a wizard to feel the magic on this. Thank you for bringing it to me. I'll hand it over to the town's clever woman for disposal.\n\nWe owe you a debt, friend. Take this. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-14388";"Shor's bones! Don't have to be a wizard to feel the magic on this. Thank you for bringing it to me. I'll hand it over to the town's clever woman for disposal.\n\nWe owe you a debt, friend. Take this. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-14389";"Ugh. I don't even want to think about how much innocent blood filled this cup! We'll find a use for it, or we'll destroy it. Hopefully the latter!\n\nWe owe you a debt, friend. Take this. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-14390";"Talk to Thane Ogvar. He's there by the gate. He's tried to organize a few counterattacks, but we haven't gotten far.\n\nWith you and your allies' help, we might finally be able to turn these bastards back."
"116521668-0-14395";"Oh, that wasn't a cheeky invitation. I think we're actually done here.\n\nI might have managed a bit of sabotage and snooping on my own, but I definitely couldn't have shut this place down without your help. So thanks for lending a hand."
"116521668-0-14396";"There's nothing I love more than taking some uppity smart-guy down a peg or six. If he wasn't crazy before you beat him, he had to have been raving mad after losing to a bunch of meat-headed misfits like the Undaunted, eh?\n\nYou do us proud."
"116521668-0-14397";"Arkasis had been terrorizing the western holds of Skyrim for years with his crazy experiments. Half the kingdom couldn't kill him, but you managed it. That's worth something.\n\nHere's your keep."
"116521668-0-14398";"I heard the mad bastard in charge of that place experimented on himself whenever he couldn't kidnap his test subjects. Not just anyone has the guts to face down that kind of crazy, let alone beat it.\n\nTake this for proving we're craziest of all."
"116521668-0-14400";"My next step is contacting House Ravenwatch to tell them what we found. Lady Thorn's connection to the Gray Host needs deeper investigation.\n\nBefore I go, I'd like you to take this. Without you, I might be up on one of those hooks. Thanks."
"116521668-0-14401";"Incredible work! Not many people could take out an entire army of blood-crazed fiends like that. We have enough evil hordes roaming around Tamriel as it is. Knowing there's one less means I sleep a little better.\n\nHere's something for you."
"116521668-0-14402";"Cleared out the bloodsuckers from that old castle, did you? Fewer evil vampires trying to conquer Tamriel sounds good to me. Say, if that castle is free now, maybe I could move in .…\n\nAnyway, here's something for your effort."
"116521668-0-14403";"Nice work! Pretty sure I could hear the screams of old Lady Thorn from here. Imagine living that long thinking you're protected from anything, only to be crushed in your own castle. Heh—puts a smile on my face.\n\nTake this reward for your efforts."
"116521668-0-14406";"Well done. You not only saved me from having to send someone to recover your corpse, you found the scouts' missing information, and stopped the Sea Giant from killing anyone else.\n\nI'll bring these notes to the proper authorities. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-14415";"So, the mud-mouth opportunist finally gets his just desserts? Ha! The Mages Guild would happily take that off your hands.\n\nI will reverse the spell … eventually. Why rush a teachable moment, eh? Take this. You have more than earned it, I think."
"116521668-0-14416";"People often forget to return Guild property. What a welcome surprise. And even better, you didn't bring that shifty mud-mouth with you! It brings me no small measure of joy to know he found nothing.\n\nTake this. News like this is worth every drake!"
"116521668-0-14423";"Of course you did, young blood. I never had a doubt.\n\nYou've earned your reward and some rest. I expect to see you bright eyed and bushy tailed when these coven witches rear their ugly heads again."
"116521668-0-14427";"You've done more than enough for a broken old man. I'd like to see the faces of everyone when I tell them. It'll take a while with this limp, but I've got something to live for now.\n\nAll I can offer you is this. Thank you."
"116521668-0-14431";"An excellent decision. Mastering the Eye is no small endeavor. But with Gabrielle's tutelage and my rigorous oversight, we may make a true scholar of you yet.\n\nWelcome to the Circle, Antiquarian."
"116521668-0-14432";"Excellent. I had a good feeling about you, and as usual, I was right.\n\nFrom now on, consider yourself free to pursue any antiquities that interest you. We will catalog your findings for study, and together we will uncover the mysteries of this world."
"116521668-0-14435";"Oh, wait, we're not done yet! I promised you compensation for your help, and I'm a Breton of my word. I know it's not much, but take this.\n\nAnd may we never see Dragons over Solitude."
"116521668-0-14436";"Oh, wait, we're not done yet! I promised you compensation for your help, and I'm a Breton of my word. I know it's not much, but take this.\n\nAnd may we never see Dragons over Solitude."
"116521668-0-14441";"<<1>> will be grateful to have his goats back, but you'll have more than a goatherd's thanks for dealing with those werewolves. Left unchecked, their pack would grow and they'd make bolder attacks than simple goat-snatching.\n\nHere's your pay."
"116521668-0-14448";"This should appease the Orcs of Mor Khazgur. They can embrace Skreg's defeat without considering it a slight on their honor. Hopefully their next champion is less controversial.\n\nHere's something to celebrate your victory."
"116521668-0-14451";"That should prove to some of these cowards that there are better ways to deal with witchcraft than sprinkling salt over their shoulders and pray to the divines.\n\nThe Swords of Solitude are honored by your victory. Take this with our gratitude."
"116521668-0-14456";"What a relief. I thought my Argonian colleague might try to skin me instead if I didn't procure her samples. I can assure you, Wood Elves are not made of wood.\n\nHere you go. Fair market value, I promise."
"116521668-0-14461";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-14462";"You've proven quite adept with strange mechanisms. We could use more like you in the Coterie. I'm more partial to the workings of living things, but I am fascinated by the lifelike behavior of Dwemer constructs.\n\nHere's your commission. Well done!"
"116521668-0-14467";"Frankly, I'm uncertain about the merits of this avenue of research, but the Coterie is about the pursuit of academic excellence, so I must trust in the process.\n\nI thought you were crazy to do it, but I admire your bravery! Here, your reward."
"116521668-0-14471";"I still have trouble believing that there's a vast, black pit underneath the hold where terrible things are waiting to drag us off and eat us. It'll be better for my sleep if I never do.\n\nTake your gold and let's never speak of this again."
"116521668-0-14488";"I thought I might be sending you on a wild goose chase, but it seems Winfred wasn't exaggerating her discovery. I wish more of these troubling claims turned out to be nothing at all.\n\nHere's your payment. Hope you won't be spending it all on repairs."
"116521668-0-14491";"Oh course you did, young blood. I never had a doubt.\n\nYou've earned your reward and some rest. I expect to see you bright eyed and bushy tailed when these coven witches rear their ugly heads again."
"116521668-0-14500";"Wonderful! This one hopes you found something that interests you.\n\nToo often, this harsh world becomes isolating. Finding companions can make it bearable, mm?  Here, a little something for your time."
"116521668-0-14501";"Judging by this bag, it looks like he died for nothing. Figures. Now I got to find a miner who actually knows how to prospect. \n\nWell, I said I'd pay you, so here you are."
"116521668-0-14502";"You take your money and get out of here.\n\nA shame Inguya won't be coming around anymore. I liked when she was nearby, if you know what I mean."
"116521668-0-14503";"Good enough. You can figure the liz— I mean, Reeh-La didn't die for nothing. This batch of samples looks promising.\n\nHere's your money. Hopefully you don't find any more of my miners."
"116521668-0-14504";"Nobody's going to find anything. Whatever Ghamborz thought he found, I'm running everything clean. His letter is worthless. I've washed the dishes, thanks to you.\n\nIt's over. Nobody wins. Lessons learned for the both of us, that's all."
"116521668-0-14505";"Yes, I do, thanks to you. \n\nYou've likely ensured my family will survive the winter. Thank you. Here, take this. I know it's not much but I can't let you walk away empty handed."
"116521668-0-14510";"Here's your pay. Now get out of here. \n\nI got work to do. These samples need to be tested. And, uh, there's some damn dishes to wash."
"116521668-0-14518";"<You sign your name to the ledger. Numerous volunteers have already signed ahead of you during these troubled times.>"
"116521668-0-14538";"The Dark Heart, you say? There's a tale as old as the Reach with an evil heart at its center. Like most Reach stories, it ends bloody.\n\nBelain might have slipped your net, but we know what she's on about. Thanks to you, this hunt isn't over yet!"
"116521668-0-14539";"The prophecy says it takes more than a handful of deaths to awaken the Dark Heart. Oh, Nathari got something to stir, but I think Lady Belain just used her to test the waters.\n\nThe darkness responded, though. Thank the spirits you stopped the ritual."
"116521668-0-14542";"Answers, I hope.\n\nLook, I have to do this. I'm going to see this journey through, no matter what truth waits at the end. Let's just go. The sooner we get this over with, the better. First, however, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14543";"That's some progress, at least. And farther than I was able to get on my own. Thank you.\n\nI'll talk to Caddach, then I'd like to make contact with Arana. We'll need the rebels' help and more if we're going to defeat the Gray Host."
"116521668-0-14544";"Unlike Gwendis, we can't rush off without a plan. Clear heads will win the day, mark my words.\n\nThis contest is far from over. With a fresh trail to follow and new allies at our side, victory is closer than ever. And much of that is because of you."
"116521668-0-14547";"Rada showed us the door and we forged the key. I have to follow. I have to stop the Darkstorm. For as you have seen from Rada's auramancy, this monstrosity is my creation.\n\nWhether you decide to accompany me or not, know that I value our friendship."
"116521668-0-14549";"If you want to work alone, see <<1>>. Odd tasks, but they pay well. For group work, talk to <<2>> and <<3>>. Their jobs are dangerous. Bring friends.\n\nHere's an advance. To show you that Ard Caddach personally supports these efforts."
"116521668-0-14551";"No, not yet. Our enemy has gained a momentary success, but now we know the extent of their plans. Knowledge is a powerful weapon, my friend.\n\nThis isn't over. We can still pull victory from the Void. Because of you, we still have a chance."
"116521668-0-14553";"Take this, my friend. You earned it. For helping me learn more about Rada al-Saran and the Gray Host, and for discovering the true connection between Verandis and the Gray Council. When you're ready for a reckoning, House Ravenwatch will contact you."
"116521668-0-14554";"Thank you. It's rare to see trust in outsiders rewarded, but none can question your valor today.\n\nTake this with our thanks. Straight from the Markarth vaults. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14556";"Wonderful. I'll make sure these get back to the Wildblood. You've done them a great service today, and I have no doubt that they will appreciate it.\n\nHere's your reward."
"116521668-0-14560";"Finally! Someone strong enough to do what's required. You performed a great service for the Reach and we won't forget that.\n\nTake this reward, and keep your weapon ready. I doubt we've seen the last of these cursed storms."
"116521668-0-14562";"Finally! Someone strong enough to do what's required. You performed a great service for the Reach and we won't forget that.\n\nTake this reward, and keep your weapon ready. I doubt we've seen the last of these cursed storms."
"116521668-0-14566";"We rest. With Rada al-Saran dead, the Gray Host is finally buried for good.\n\nWe couldn't have done it without you, partner. So eat, drink. Find some company for your bed. And tomorrow … tomorrow we'll probably have to do this all over again."
"116521668-0-14570";"Although the Spiritblood do not allow outsiders within its ranks, we still recognize what you've done this day. \n\nYou may travel through the Reach, confident that none may question your strength. The song of your triumph echoes through time."
"116521668-0-14575";"Thanks to you, Snowy and I can return to Hiretta. I know the way. And it looks like our bunny has had enough adventures for one day. I certainly have!\n\nAnd I promise to keep my temper in check as my wife and I discuss our future prospecting."
"116521668-0-14577";"As safe as it can be. Here, my friend. This is for you. You may not be Crow-Eye by blood, but you are now connected to us and our land.\n\nThe spirits sent you for a reason. I'm just grateful you heard them and answered their call."
"116521668-0-14581";"Fabulous. If you already joined the organization, you know the drill. If not, or if you don't think you're quite ready yet, Bolgrul over there has contracts that will get you up to speed for a lesser cut.\n\nGood hunting, scamp."
"116521668-0-14582";"Absolutely. Kathad risked everything to save his clan. He performed admirably, despite Freyleth's dark influence. He will make a fine addition to our family.\n\nAnd Adusa appreciates your help, five-claw. The Ravenwatch will not forget your service."
"116521668-0-14583";"Soon. For now, savor this victory. The courage of mortals, not some buried relic, is the true heart of the Reach. You've saved countless lives, and proved to the Reachfolk that not all outsiders are a threat to this land.\n\nRada's time will come."
"116521668-0-14585";"Fabulous. If you're already signed up with the organization, you know the drill. If not, or if you don't feel quite ready yet, Bolgrul over there has contracts that will get you up to speed for a lesser cut.\n\nGood hunting, scamp."
"116521668-0-14593";"Good. You dealt the Thornroot clan a serious blow. Hopefully, this will give the Wildblood clan a chance to rescue some of those that were taken.\n\nI'll make sure my contacts know what you did today. In the meantime, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14599";"Well done! That should quell the Thornroot clan's violent tendencies and allow the Wildblood clan to breathe a little easier. At least for a while.\n\nHere, as promised, your portion of the reward."
"116521668-0-14600";"Simply put. Aye, I like that.\n\nIn doing what needed doing, you brought all the crowns of Skyrim to one hall. You put the Gray Host back in the ground. And you gave us clear skies. At last, we can see where we must go. Take this, with all our thanks."
"116521668-0-14606";"There you are, just in time. Hopefully these specimens will be enough to satisfy my contacts.\n\nHere's your cut of the reward. And come back later. I'm sure to have plenty more work for you."
"116521668-0-14608";"Ah, I suppose you did. Sticky, isn't it? Lovely.\n\nI'll make sure it gets to my contacts as soon as possible. Here. You earned this. I'm sure you'll need some of it to pay to get your pack cleaned."
"116521668-0-14611";"Excellent. If the Reachfolk were worried, I shudder to think what that egg contained. I'll let them know the danger has passed.\n\nThanks for all of your help. Here's the payment I promised. I look forward to working with you again soon."
"116521668-0-14639";"Hard to say. I suspect it will mostly return to normal … in about a few hundred years. But of course, with Dwemer relics, you can never really be sure.\n\nRegardless, I could not have done this without you. Here, take this. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-14643";"Well, I should bring this eerie tome to Farrul Lupus. But first, I'm curious about that other book I found. The words seem encrypted? But I'm not sure.\n\nEither way, thanks for helping me rescue it from the True-Sworn. We make quite the team!"
"116521668-0-14644";"Wish I could have been there when you smashed up that fancy villa. Nothing makes me smile faster than tearing apart opulent homes. Especially in the service of taking down a haughty dolt like Pyroturge Encratis.\n\nJust feels good, you know?"
"116521668-0-14645";"Heh—didn't find enough treasure laying around the halls of Durcorach's old haunt? I thought that place was littered with the stuff.\n\nOh, I'm just joking with you. I would never deny anyone their just reward! Here you go."
"116521668-0-14646";"The conquering hero returns! I heard a rumor around the inns that you stomped the True-Sworn and Pyroturge Encratis hard. Probably not the last we've heard of them, but they'll think twice before going after you again.\n\nYou earned this."
"116521668-0-14648";"Ah, you heard that. Yes, I hope to find a map within the lockbox once Drathas opens it. It should lead me to even greater mysteries.\n\nBut that doesn't matter to you now. I promised gold and here it is. Well deserved, I must say."
"116521668-0-14649";"Sure, we've got plenty of death-obsessed cults in these lands, but people feel safer with one less running around. Especially after they hear about how thoroughly you smashed them. You earned this key."
"116521668-0-14650";"Rescuing some Dark Elves and reuniting a father and son? Well, aren't you the hero? I bet crushing some cultist skull didn't feel bad, either.\n\nHa—I'm just giving you a hard time. Take your key."
"116521668-0-14651";"You showed that overgrown dolt Baron Zaudrus a thing or two, huh? I won't say he didn't deserve a sound beating after kidnapping all those people. But I'm sure it felt pretty good, too.\n\nHere's your well-earned key."
"116521668-0-14655";"I'm relieved to hear the problem was dealt with. And I'll destroy these vile notes. Thank you, outsider. We will have other jobs for you in the future.\n\nFor now, take this with the appreciation of the Ard's Stonehands."
"116521668-0-14657";"At last, we can put this shameful episode behind us. With any luck, no one will ever try to perform such a dangerous ritual again.\n\nHere's your reward."
"116521668-0-14659";"So that old reeker wasn't as crazy as he looked? First time that's worked out! \n\nSuppose I can tell him his rod works. I won't tell him what happened to the construct, though. It would break the outsider's heart. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-14661";"So the scout was right? I'll admit, I thought I was sending you on a fool's errand. Good work. The Stonehands will be sure to call on you again.\n\nFor now, take this reward. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14663";"It was real? Part of me thought our scout was just seeing things in the shadows. Glad you got rid of it, anyway. Hopefully, we can find at least a few useful things in all this mess. \n\nHere's your gold."
"116521668-0-14665";"Time to put this place behind us. Until these troubles pass, we're best off on our own.\n\nA Hillhunter pays her debts. Here you are, friend. As for Briar Rock, leave it to the dead."
"116521668-0-14672";"Then may your message reach Aetherius, traveler. I'm glad to have been a part of your celebration of the Old Life.\n\nTake this. It's my gift to you, in the spirit of the tradition. Something special, so you can remember this Old Life day."
"116521668-0-14674";"The Shehai … it's a sacred and private thing to a Redguard. I tried to help Sai. Told him what I thought. What happens next? That's up to him.\n\nThanks for your help, partner. If we're keeping score, I owe you. A lot. Now I need to talk to Sai."
"116521668-0-14680";"We did not fail on this day. The true story here is of an Eagleseer lass, a Six-Ford lad who now see each other not as foes, but as friends. And who have pledged to end this feud, in a kinder time.\n\nFor your part in this outsider, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-14681";"I cannot say, outsider. Though I must have spun a hundred-score tales in my lifetime, I don't have words to answer you. It is up to Eslyn and Madearn now.\n\nMany lives will be saved because of this handfasting. We can take solace in that. Pride, even."
"116521668-0-14682";"The tale of this day is not of a feud ongoing. It's of an Eagleseer lass, a Six-Ford lad who now see each other not as foes, but as friends. In time, they might just bring this feud to its end.\n\nFor your part in this outsider, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-14694";"<The pack is empty save for some gold, an old helm, and a number of dessicated, half-eaten mushrooms.>"
"116521668-0-14698";"A good sturdy knife is more than just a tool, it is a defense against the rigors of the world. And so is this beautifully crafted furnishing you provided. \n\nThank you for your contribution, and take this as your reward."
"116521668-0-14700";"It's a small thing to own a clean shirt, a pair of trousers without holes, or a tent to keep off the rain. Though, can anyone really argue the boost it gives one's dignity?\n\nThank you. We will put this to good use. And take this for your efforts."
"116521668-0-14702";"I used to think that our people were like tempered steel, but I think we're more like an old tree. Sometimes it grows too big and falls over in the wind.\n\nTrees can always grow back, though, with stronger roots. Thank you, my friend."
"116521668-0-14704";"I never understood why my grandmother was so afraid that we didn't have enough to eat. It only took one hungry night in the wilderness to finally see.\n\nThank you for this. I'll see that it gets to the right family. And take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-14712";"And I thank you for that, wanderer. <<1>> would be pleased to know it made it here. The Symbol of Hrokkibeg will forever be a part of this shrine, helping to create a proper sanctuary.\n\nHere. I can't let you leave without a proper reward."
"116521668-0-14713";"In some tales, Gulibeg's swift bite weakens his adversaries. Then he tricks them into falling from a cliff or drowning in a river. Perhaps that's what happened to the raider.\n\nNo matter. We have the relic, thanks to you. Take this for your efforts."
"116521668-0-14714";"Twice you affirm to me your commitment to the Rites. So it shall be. The path lies before you. Through here you will meet our Rites Matron. Speak with her to begin the challenge.\n\nI wish you luck. Perhaps you will emerge to honor the Reach."
"116521668-0-14716";"Some of our oldest songs speak of Storihbeg, the King of Wolves. He first taught our ancestors to change shape and become even mightier hunters. Our shrine must pay homage to this aspect of Hircine.\n\nTake this, wanderer, with my thanks."
"116521668-0-14719";"Even the smallest piece of Dwarven metal has a chance of deflecting a killing blow. This will surely save more than one of our fighters. Thank you.\n\nAnd that's for you. We want to keep you safe, too, so use it to repair your gear."
"116521668-0-14721";"Perfect, harrier! This will give us the edge we need against the Gray Host.\n\nTake this with my thanks. Once again, you prove yourself to be a true friend to the Reach."
"116521668-0-14724";"Just holding these gemstones makes me feel uneasy. Like there's something deep inside them that wishes to be free. But I am no shaman.\n\nThank you. We appreciate the risks you undertake on our behalf. I hope this small token shows our appreciation."
"116521668-0-14730";"Impressive. If we can keep this up, the Gray Host will learn to fear us in time. Eventually, the few that remain will scatter into the dark like roaches fleeing the light.\n\nTake this. You earned it, harrier."
"116521668-0-14733";"Our witches will make good use of these, harrier. They will employ this knowledge to better defend the Reach against our many enemies.\n\nTake this. May it protect you on the road ahead."
"116521668-0-14736";"Thank you, harrier. Lorkh taught us to fight back against the darkness in our hearts. It's worth reminding him that we still hear him, even in these troubled times.\n\nHere, take this. After all, he never said we had to face the darkness alone."
"116521668-0-14739";"Thank you for dealing with this. And for bringing this to me. I will bury it on the banks of the Karth. Hopefully, his spirit will know peace.\n\nAs for the survivors, we will give them a place among us and teach them to better defend themselves."
"116521668-0-14750";"Excellent! With all five aspects of our Hunt-Father represented, Hircine will recognize this shrine as sacred and true.\n\nConsider this place your sanctuary, my friend. You built it as surely as did I and my apprentices. Take this with our thanks."
"116521668-0-14759";"Although the Spiritblood do not allow outsiders within its ranks, we still recognize what you've done this day. \n\nYou may travel through the Reach, confident that none may question your strength. The song of your triumph echoes through time."
"116521668-0-14766";"I would say so. Of course, it will take time before the sorcerer's magic fully dissipates. And I'm no expert on voriplasms. I suppose he could pull himself back together. Eventually.\n\nHere. Take this. I insist. Unlike Stibbons, you earned it."
"116521668-0-14767";"Farrul Lupus? He hired me to investigate Black Drake Villa. But why is the word Ambitions capitalized? It must mean something special.\n\nThanks for helping me. Here. Take part of what Lupus already paid me. There's more if you come with me to Riften."
"116521668-0-14772";"What now? Can't we just rest for a while and bask in the glory? I know, there's another Ambition out there. And we need to keep Sombren and Calia safe. But still!\n\nOh, Keshu asked me to give this to you. A reward for defending Blackwood!"
"116521668-0-14774";"Jirich's and Sophus's documents contain information written in Imperial code. I sent for the scribe Beragon, but he has yet to arrive. Until then, the councilors will remain safe within these walls.\n\nYou have done well so far and have my thanks."
"116521668-0-14775";"All right, we have a plan. In the meantime, we saved Councilor Lovidicus, cleared the Dark Brotherhood of the murders, and determined Vandacia is the traitor and leader of the cult.\n\nYou did good, my friend. Here, your share of our compensation."
"116521668-0-14777";"We are all in danger. At least you kept the Ambitions safe. I thank you for that.\n\nConcerning the cult, Eveli and I have made plans. But first, I want you to have this. Compensation for the work you have done up to this point on Blackwood's behalf."
"116521668-0-14781";"Perfect! I was telling the governor everything that happened. How we traveled to the Deadlands and stopped Vandacia from sacrificing the third Ambition. We need to figure out our next move.\n\nOh, before I forget, here's your share of our compensation."
"116521668-0-14782";"Who can ever guess the wind's direction? But I choose to believe so. We reminded them of their strength when they work together.\n\nI suppose you came for the promised reward. From my claws to my tail, I say this in earnest—you deserve this."
"116521668-0-14783";"Please, take this. Not only did you fight bravely, but you ensured a truce between my tribe and the Imperials. You saved many lives today.\n\nI will make sure no one leaves you out of the grand stories of our heroism!"
"116521668-0-14784";"Oh, right. Joy unto Tamriel, the tyrant King of Pork now wallows with the dead, his haunches and hoard divided among the heroic and the hungry, his head hung on high as hallmark of his hubris!\n\nHere's your cut, and your cuts! They're real, I swear!"
"116521668-0-14786";"I'll inform my order and through our efforts perhaps they'll be able to restore this abbey to glory.\n\nRegardless, Zenithar leaves no debts and you more than earned your due. Take this blessed coin with all my thanks."
"116521668-0-14789";"Yes, thanks to you. The Sul-Xan in this place will flounder without their idol and my friends are now safely out of their reach. You saved us, and likely many more, with your actions.\n\nTake this, beek-ojel, with our thanks."
"116521668-0-14790";"Damn fine work. I'll get my troops together and we'll mop up the stragglers. \n\nSo much for those experts. You did the work of both of them. And most of us, for that matter! Borderwatch is in your debt. This is all the payment I could muster."
"116521668-0-14792";"I think we can all walk away from this. We ship Quistley home—secretly. Then we make sure that Tenarei has something she can take back to Larz-Tul.\n\nThank you, friend. I think Lord Silvelle would agree that you've earned your payment."
"116521668-0-14793";"We need to find the people on that list. Warn them about the Dark Brotherhood. See what they can tell us about the Ambitions. And what I should do with this book. \n\nHey, thanks by the way. I never got the rest of my pay, but I can spare this for now."
"116521668-0-14800";"We may be bruised, battered, and wet, but these relics tell a magnificent story! Without your help, I'd never have learned about the fate of Phalevon and the horn. Thank you!\n\nOh! I shouldn't forget your pay. Visit me in Gideon sometime!"
"116521668-0-14807";"Marvelous! Elsweyr is a land both majestic and terrifying, wouldn't you agree? The Khajiit are so full of life. Theirs is a culture unlike any other in Tamriel.\n\nHere's your reward, brave adventurer. I hope you enjoyed yourself."
"116521668-0-14812";"Not yet, but I'm sure something will occur to us. It usually always does.\n\nIn the meantime, take this. Your share of our compensation from Leyawiin. I couldn't have found the twins and saved them without your help. Thanks."
"116521668-0-14815";"Hopefully, Tiras's testimonial will earn me some latitude with House Telvanni. Not enough to rise in rank, mind you. But enough to keep them off my back for a while.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without you. Thank you, sera."
"116521668-0-14817";"Just one apple won't make much, but every little bit helps. Jad'zirri will give you a mugful anyway, she is certain once you try it you will work doubly hard for apples in the future!\n\nEnjoy!"
"116521668-0-14819";"These should be juicy enough to start a new batch, though Jad'zirri will need a few more helpers to keep her supply up.\n\nDrink up! Once you are refreshed you'll be ready to bring this one twice as many apples, yes?"
"116521668-0-14820";"Oh ho! You bring Jad'zirri a heaping handful! Something she can really dig her toes into! Don't worry she strains the juice very thoroughly. No choking on claws, jaunter.\n\nBut let us get your own juices flowing. Take these as your just reward!"
"116521668-0-14821";"What a bountiful bushel you've brought! Jad'zirri isn't sure her tub will contain all the juices if she tries to plunge into so much mush. Rest assured, this one will not waste a drop of this odoriferous extract.\n\nAnd for you an equally juicy reward!"
"116521668-0-14823";"What's a priceless specimen compare to those smiling faces, eh? Does leave me feeling guilty for hesitating, but I'm glad you were here to set me right. Told you I needed that clear head of yours!\n\nHere's a little something for letting me borrow it."
"116521668-0-14832";"Yes! I want to write, and travel, and feel the rush of romance every time I slip on this ring! Mathen and I have so much to offer one another.\n\nIt will be a little weird, yes. But like I said before, who wants normal romance? Certainly not me!"
"116521668-0-14838";"Indeed. Your actions ensured those remains can no longer be exploited. I am sure were their spirits still present, they would thank you for your efforts.\n\nAllow me to extend a more tangible gratitude. Here, for your help."
"116521668-0-14847";"Yes, I'd rather not resort to violence. Hopefully, Cres won't fight the banishment.\n\nThis is the end it seems. Let's see it through together."
"116521668-0-14848";"All's well that ends well, as they say. This certainly wasn't the direction I expected this story to take, but a good mystery always keeps you guessing.\n\nYou were a grand co-star. If we ever adapt Investigator Vale for the stage I'll be sure to call."
"116521668-0-14852";"You're right, of course. I'm desperate for some grand romance, but it's no more real than my stories if I act selfishly. Ugh.\n\nLet's focus on the good things, right? A curse broken, a writer inspired … and it's all your doing! Thank you, my friend!"
"116521668-0-14853";"Oh, right. Of course. Deet-Loh would still be digging up grubs if not for you. You deserve this.\n\nNot many strangers would stop to help an Argonian who talks to pigs. Thanks again."
"116521668-0-14863";"I thought so! Well, you've come to the right place. The Impresario asked me to compensate such enterprising explorers with a suitable reward. Here you are! I trust your continued adventures will take you to equally rich and fulfilling frontiers!"
"116521668-0-14874";"Excellent. Another successful prank. The Jester's Festival would be nothing without this kind of fun, I thank you for joining.\n\nI'll put together another prank kit for you tonight. Come back tomorrow, and I'll set you up with another!"
"116521668-0-14875";"It was. The volcanic vents have been contained, at least for now. The danger is passed. The underlying mystery persists, however. Who would use magic to awaken the volcano? And why? I must ponder this. \n\nHere, your reward. I appreciate your help."
"116521668-0-14880";"We may be bruised, battered, and wet, but we are successful! Even without Phalevon's Horn of Magnificence, the other relics have a great story to tell. Thank you!\n\nOh! I shouldn't forget your pay. Come visit me in Gideon sometime!"
"116521668-0-14881";"Yes, yes! Thanks to you, crow-friend. It is a triumphant day for the Blackfeather Court! \n\nI found a shiny in this place, but I no longer trust it. It must be gone. Gone! Take it, as a tribute from the Court."
"116521668-0-14882";"If you prefer to work alone, see <<1>>. He's got odd tasks, but they pay well. If you're interested in group tasks, talk to <<2>>. Group work is dangerous. Bring friends!\n\nHere's a modest advance to show you that we're serious about these efforts."
"116521668-0-14883";"Wonderful, I knew I could count on you. Now Leric's bad luck is sure to change. You have my deepest thanks.\n\nHere is your payment, your efforts are appreciated."
"116521668-0-14885";"Two Minotaurs? I heard rumors about a monster with four arms and two heads—now I know why. Let's hope that removing the heirlooms those scholars dug up keeps Minotaurs from returning to the site. \n\nTake this, with the gratitude of Leyawiin."
"116521668-0-14890";"The Keywright's Gallery opened doors to every corner of Tamriel. Places, I suspect, that desperately need a hero's aid.\n\nThis choice is yours to make. But wherever you choose to go, I'm sure adventure awaits. May the stars protect you."
"116521668-0-14893";"Aloysius didn't run off and leave me, like half the others. He even gave his life to protect me. I've never had anyone love me that much. Is it wrong that makes me happy?\n\nTake this for delivering my betrothed's last wishes. It was kind of you."
"116521668-0-14899";"There's nothing left to be done than pay my respects to the Tribunal and pray Liam can rest in our family tomb.\n\nI couldn't save my little brother, but you helped me try when no one else would. If you ever need anything. You need only ask."
"116521668-0-14904";"I did try. And we saved these folk, at least. You reckon that's enough? Never stuck my neck out like this for strangers. You doubly so. Didn't mean to get you into all this trouble.\n\nYou can take this though, for helping me get the seed I was after."
"116521668-0-14909";"We leave this useless s'wit to his report and count Azura's lucky stars. My little brother is alive and well thanks to you. That's more than I could ask.\n\nWe owe you. If you ever need anything—and I mean anything—you can count on me."
"116521668-0-14910";"Good! Toad-Tongue raids brought trade in northern Blackwood to a standstill. And our unfortunate scholar would be glad to know that her notes survived.\n\nThank you, on behalf of Leyawiin. We'll have other jobs for you in the future."
"116521668-0-14915";"Thank you. The families of the captives you saved are in your debt. And I'll sleep better knowing that those Sul-Xan fanatics won't trouble us for a while.\n\nTake this, with the appreciation of Leyawiin. And check back for more work soon."
"116521668-0-14917";"I'm relieved to see you hale and whole. Old Deathwart was a known man-eater. I couldn't remember if I mentioned that part before. Anyway, those singing frogs should make the Argonians happy.\n\nThank you. We'll have another job for you soon."
"116521668-0-14919";"Excellent news! At last someone has put an end to Xeemhok's brutal reign. These tokens you brought back should help us to identify those adventurers who were less fortunate than you.\n\nHere—Blackwood thanks you. Check back for more work soon."
"116521668-0-14921";"I thank you. It was a grim and dangerous task I gave you, but it had to be done. The families of those Ghemvas killed will be glad to know those souls are at peace.\n\nTake this, with our gratitude. We'll have more work for you soon."
"116521668-0-14931";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-14932";"Yes, I feel the old city settling. The raging energies grow calm. Krona-Konu—Rockgrove—is safe once again.\n\nSuch a hard-shelled protector has come to our aid. The tribe extends our tails in gratitude. Please, take this as a reward."
"116521668-0-14933";"Yes, I feel the old city settling. The raging energies grow calm. Krona-Konu—Rockgrove—is safe once again.\n\nSuch a hard-shelled protector has come to our aid. The tribe extends our tails in gratitude. Please, take this as a reward."
"116521668-0-14934";"Yes, I feel the old city settling. The raging energies grow calm. Krona-Konu—Rockgrove—is safe once again.\n\nSuch a hard-shelled protector has come to our aid. The tribe extends our tails in gratitude. Please, take this as a reward."
"116521668-0-14935";"Ah, well done. I see you understand the traditions of battles within the marsh. I erect the spine of gratitude for this gift. We shall roast it during our victory celebration.\n\nIn exchange for the trophy, may I offer you this reward."
"116521668-0-14936";"Ah, well done. I see you understand the traditions of battles within the marsh. I erect the spine of gratitude for this gift. We shall roast it during our victory celebration.\n\nIn exchange for the trophy, may I offer you this reward."
"116521668-0-14937";"By bark and bone, you honor me with this trophy. The heart of such a creature contains great power and hidden wisdom. I shall think of you when I bite into it and let the juices run down my scales.\n\nIn thanks for all you have done, we offer a gift."
"116521668-0-14938";"Our stone-talker, Dust-on-Scales, claims to know who led this attack. If true, he may have an idea of how to reclaim our home from these impure tail-lifters.\n\nSpeak to him. He is tending to one of our wounded. And … I am grateful for your aid."
"116521668-0-14958";"Absolutely! Now that you've stripped the Fang-Furls of their leader, the empire will dismantle itself. Which opens up a great deal of business opportunities.\n\nNone of which would be possible without you. Take this with our deepest thanks."
"116521668-0-14962";"Yes, but word will pass quickly that his grip on Leyawiin isn't as sure as he claims. It won't be long before others join us in opposing him. And our business can flourish.\n\nWe are quite grateful for you. Here, for services rendered, with our thanks."
"116521668-0-14965";"I guess I'll stay in Gideon until we put this matter to rest for good. I want to see these people's faces when they come to terms with what really happened! Then? It's back to Bravil and my woodshop! Sooner the better!\n\nThanks, hero. For everything."
"116521668-0-14966";"Here. Your share of the last of our compensation from Leyawiin. And a little something from me. I learned so much at your side. If you ever need any help, just send word and I'll come running.\n\nOh, look! I think Governor Keshu's ready to speak."
"116521668-0-14971";"I do. Unraveling my past has long been a dream of mine. But I have to admit I never expected to feel so, well, nervous about finding out how I came to be where I was raised.\n\nI couldn't have done this without you. Thank you."
"116521668-0-14982";"If Vinnus says the stone was linked to the Prince of Change, I believe him. He was always right, it was incredibly annoying. I'm going to miss that.\n\nThank you. As terrible as the news is, I can't imagine what not knowing would have done to me."
"116521668-0-14987";"Not yet. Right now, I still want travel and adventure. Being part of my sister's family is something that will happen with time. \n\nThank you for seeing this through. I think I'd rather face a dozen Dragons than the ghosts of the past."
"116521668-0-14997";"Are you kidding? If I don't get you out of here she'll make you meet the entire extended family. Davon's Watch is just down the road. She can make her way home from there.\n\nThank you for putting up with all this. I'll make it up to you."
"116521668-0-15000";"Good work. The less questions we ask about this one, the better, I am sure.\n\nHere, your reward."
"116521668-0-15005";"No, we should give her and granddad some space. They have a lot to catch up on, assuming they don't just start cursing each other out.\n\nWe've done our part. Let's get back to saving the world, or whatever."
"116521668-0-15006";"I am glad you made it back in one piece. It would be a shame to die for a poem that is not even written yet. \n\nHere is your payment, your efforts are appreciated."
"116521668-0-15009";"I will see it safely tucked away with the Clutch of Nisswo. Your reward, as promised. \n\nNow, I must perform my rites as soul tender. You may observe, if you wish. It would honor him to have another in attendance."
"116521668-0-15011";"<Ill-gotten gold waits beneath the pile of loose dirt.>"
"116521668-0-15015";"Maybe. I hope so. Whether my friends and I will ever be able move past all this? That's another matter.\n\nHere's your reward. Without your help, well … there's no telling what my lady is capable of. Thank you, and may the shadows guide you."
"116521668-0-15020";"No doubt she will. Just as you have. You've done more than I could have asked. You're one of us now, as far as I'm concerned. I hope if it comes to it, you'll fight beside us once again.\n\nTake this. You've earned it."
"116521668-0-15022";"I am sure you are right. We may not have Xyria, but the Black Fin Legion is proud to call you an ally. Let's hope it's enough.\n\nTake this, with my gratitude. You've more than earned it."
"116521668-0-15025";"I am sure he was pleased. I have no personal stake in the matter, so I assume you did what you thought was best. I will be sure to seek you out again if those two need you to go egg hunting once more.\n\nHere is your payment, thank you for your work."
"116521668-0-15028";"Oh, good. She frightens me a little. I am glad you decided to go with her instead. Well done, at any rate. I will be sure to seek you out again if those two need you to go egg hunting once more.\n\nHere is your payment, your efforts are appreciated."
"116521668-0-15035";"Excellent. I had a feeling you would be successful. \n\nYou likely saved a lot of lives by dealing the Sul-Xan such a blow. I wish I could offer you more, but I hope this will be sufficient. Here, your reward."
"116521668-0-15037";"Wonderful. I am sure Olith will be here to pick these little ones up shortly, but in the meantime I will make sure they receive excellent care.\n\nHere is your payment, thank you for your work."
"116521668-0-15053";"They can't remain here. I'll see them taken far away from this place, and each other, but that's a problem for another day. \n\nYou've returned my temple's treasures and done a great service for Azura. Take this and her blessings."
"116521668-0-15054";"Heard the knight-commander of the Silver Rose was decked head-to-toe in kit straight from Oblivion. Glad you showed it's more than the gear that makes the warrior! You ever want to battle in the buff, I'm game.\n\nTake your spoils and think about it."
"116521668-0-15055";"I don't know. How much of a fight could an outfit with a name like Silver Rose put up?\n\nBut a pledge is a pledge. Take your cut."
"116521668-0-15056";"Heard those knights had some mighty fine trophies piled up in their vaults. Might make fine welcome gifts for thin skinned newbloods! Give me a hunk of lumber and a lump of iron and I'll take on the world. You too, I wager.\n\nTake your prize, killer."
"116521668-0-15058";"You're right. I shouldn't let his misdeeds stain my honor anymore than they already have.\n\nHere, take this as a payment for your assistance. You should go before Martus drags you into anything else."
"116521668-0-15059";"Not many Undaunted can claim they've beaten a natural disaster into submission—not that Hroltar hasn't tried—but you'll be the first to have me vouch for it.\n\nHere's your prize, killer. I know who to call next time Bolgrul starts snoring."
"116521668-0-15060";"Dirty work, mucking a bunch of foul Daedra out of a moldering prison in the swamp. But we don't shy away from messy business, do we Undaunted?\n\nTake your reward and air out your boots before the swamp rot sets in."
"116521668-0-15061";"Can't say I know what a Incarnate even is, but it sounds impressive, at least. You can tell me all about how you sent the shaky bastard back to Oblivion over drinks later.\n\nFor now, take what's yours, Undaunted."
"116521668-0-15064";"Wonderful. You altered the current irrevocably and your stories are woven into the stream. You see? You are changed. And I am changed for having met you. Stagnant waters go nowhere, after all. \n\nPlease, take this. Thank you for indulging me."
"116521668-0-15074";"Thanks to you, more like. Sure, everyone here played a part, but no one would be left standing if you hadn't been there. You're the reason Tamriel is safe.\n\nI look up to you, you know. You deserve so much more than this, but here. Take it."
"116521668-0-15075";"Daedra don't need help. Why fight for us? I thought mortals valued their own kind. \n\nI will take him back to town. We need to stabilize it. Make it the same as it was. Nothing must threaten my protection. You completed the task. Here's the payment."
"116521668-0-15077";"Yes, yes, well done and all that drivel.\n\nSadly, the Crowborne Horror is a creature of habit. Given its nature, it will likely return at some point. I will continue scrying for its presence in case we need to draw it out again. For now, take this."
"116521668-0-15080";"I am still considering our options. At least we have the Anchorite, and she still has her powers. That is enough for now.\n\nYou did well, mortal. Against all odds, you continue to prevail. Take this with my gratitude and prepare for what comes next."
"116521668-0-15081";"Absolutely! Tamriel owes us a huge clap on the back, if I do say so myself. It's been a long journey, but we're finally at the end.\n\nLet's enjoy this victory, we certainly earned it. And you most of all. You big hero, you."
"116521668-0-15082";"A note? But that means …. Oh, my foolish sister—always so proud.\n\nHere's your reward, stranger. You brought as much of Pibiha back to me as you could. Even with the pain they bring, Tufeh is glad to have these words."
"116521668-0-15083";"We can't allow Nokvroz to harm the Anchorite or spill a drop of her blood. We will deal with that shortly.\n\nYou ended the threat of Sister Celdina and revealed things I did not know. I am satisfied with that, little mortal. Take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-15084";"It is over for now, little mortal. I too am curious about the daughter of a Longhouse Emperor, but thanks to your efforts at Ardent Hope, she remains out of Dagon's hands.\n\nYou have served both me and your world well. Take this. With my gratitude."
"116521668-0-15088";"Yes, and whose corpse now rests before us. He will serve my purposes well, I think.\n\nTime enough for that later. For now, take this. I understand that your kind expects such treats after performing clever tricks for your betters."
"116521668-0-15090";"And you don't have to. Just know that the cult plans to unleash destruction on your world. Now, I must contemplate. The device, it can change Daedra ….\n\nI must return to Fargrave. I will summon you when I learn more. Until then, you have my thanks."
"116521668-0-15096";"I don't know. I need to find a way back home, away from this plane. And I must perform rites for the dead. But I can manage that on my own. No need for a protector.\n\nHere's the reward I promised. On behalf of the memory of the Kalmur clan, thank you."
"116521668-0-15097";"An inexperienced adventurer managed to free an Ordinator's spirit from the heart of Dagon's realm? Sotha Sil, it's only through your power that I'm even alive!\n\nI—here, a small sample of the gifts I'll give to the Temple as soon as I return."
"116521668-0-15104";"Patience, mortal. You have done well. Take pride in your accomplishments and accept this minor token of my appreciation.\n\nWith Rynkyus, Arox, and the Anchorite at our side, we may yet complete both our missions. Prepare yourself. We move out shortly."
"116521668-0-15105";"I'm not sure yet, but the answer will become clear soon enough.\n\nI should not have gotten angry, little mortal. You have helped me a great deal. And you certainly helped Fargrave and Nirn by destroying the Riven Cataclyst. Take this as recompense."
"116521668-0-15124";"If you want to work alone, see Luna Beriel. Vaveli Indavel of the Saraathu Tong also provides jobs, but they're dangerous. You'll want a group to deal with them.\n\nHere. Consider this an investment into your adventuring career."
"116521668-0-15125";"The Waking Flame should know what it feels like to have something they care about burned. It's not usual that we get to carry out some fitting justice. \n\nHere's the reward from Fyna and the Gleaners. Neither of us like cults spewing lies in our city."
"116521668-0-15126";"I'm still a novice at appraising goods, but those look like they'd fetch a hefty price. I'll let some of the junior members know I have them and they'll take care of getting this all to our fences. \n\nHere. Your good work's earned you this."
"116521668-0-15127";"Glayamen, the thief, will be thrilled to know that those aren't going to be buried in mite-infested dirt. His hands were really itching to go back and get them, but the healers say they'll clear up in a few days.\n\nThanks again! Here's your payment."
"116521668-0-15128";"Amazing! Once Tuleenith, the healer, examines these, I'm sure Fargrave will have a great new cure for … scale foot. Or—or stomach sores! Something!\n\nHere, take this. You certainly worked for it."
"116521668-0-15129";"You got into and out of the Blood Pit? Blood and brimstone, that's excellent! Most Gleaners can't make it out of there, but I was almost certain you could do it! \n\nHere's your payment. You sure pull off some impressive stunts."
"116521668-0-15130";"I was worried that those were going to be taken before you got to them. The Shambles is crawling with Errants, Dremora, and Spiderkith, after all.\n\nHere, take this for your help."
"116521668-0-15140";"I will be a million times more merciful than he would be. Not that he deserves it, but I won't stoop to his level. Once he's gone, the Divines can decide his penance.\n\nYou don't need to stick around for this. Take your reward and get out of this pit."
"116521668-0-15164";"Indeed! Wasn't it fantastic? Those minstrels really rose to the occasion!\n\nPlease take this as my thanks and stop back any time. A performance of that caliber demands an encore."
"116521668-0-15165";"Maybe? This is Fargrave, after all. The city connects to everywhere. Madam Whim must know someone here who can help us with that.\n\nIn the meantime, we made a deal and I always honor my commitments. Here. You earned this, my friend."
"116521668-0-15172";"A question I must ponder. There are few places I can think of to hide such a device. None of them pleasant. And there are the Bladebearers to consider. Why was their sword in the keep?\n\nFor now, take this as a reward. That is the mortal custom, yes?"
"116521668-0-15182";"Well done. The goods you brought back definitely will help us get that new portal up and running. Maybe there's even enough for all the experimental magics that Vares Dredayn has been asking for.\n\nHere's your reward."
"116521668-0-15185";"You managed to kill the Unmaker? That's impressive. You've solved an annoyance for me. Everyone in the Tong works diligently to keep their skills sharp. Ravam will thank me for interrupting his break. \n\nHere, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-15187";"Excellent work. Vares Dredayn will be elated to hear that he can check on the data stored in the stones.\n\nPlease accept this and our thanks."
"116521668-0-15191";"Verdam will be relieved to know you've dealt with the Mantikora problem. I'll just … let one of the apprentices know that I have the samples and this matter will be settled. \n\nAs promised, here's your reward."
"116521668-0-15193";"Our enemies are persistent. I have no doubt they'll try something like this again. But you kept Saraathu Tong secrets safe. For that, your value is immeasurable. \n\nYou succeeded where others failed us. Please, take this."
"116521668-0-15199";"Good. Now they and everyone else will think twice before they try to sacrifice members of the Tong. \n\nYou did well today. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-15208";"Indeed. There are arrangements that can be made, but they still must answer for their crimes. You need not concern yourself. \n\nI thank you for your assistance in this matter. The Grasp offers this in return."
"116521668-0-15217";"That is unfortunate. But they will die in time, as all mortals do. At least the Redmaiden can be restored to its rightful owner.\n\nThe Stricture demands I reward you regardless of the outcome. So here, your payment. I will not call upon you again."
"116521668-0-15218";"Somewhere far, hopefully. Find our way back to Nirn eventually. Atrozu and I will have to keep moving. But we'll have each other. And the memories of my family.\n\nI haven't forgotten your reward. Here you go. Thank you for being there for both of us."
"116521668-0-15219";"Ah, so Mikget wasn't completely useless. Madam Whim won't be totally displeased with his performance.\n\nFor his lack of follow through, I'll pay Mikget a portion of the agreed upon earnings. You have rightful claim to the rest. Here."
"116521668-0-15220";"Predictable. She always makes things harder for herself. Still, she managed to find it, perhaps she does display some aptitude. I may hire her again when she reforms.\n\nMortal, take this as payment for your efforts and go with Madam Whim's gratitude."
"116521668-0-15221";"Y'ffre's bones! Quite an array of daring deeds and gorgeous sights! This is just the sort of thing that my readers are looking for.\n\nNow then—an honest day's pay for an honest day's work! Safe travels, mate, and thanks again!"
"116521668-0-15223";"That's the trouble with mortals. Many don't have the experience to survive on the planes. \n\nHere. Someone should have the gold that was set aside for Robhir."
"116521668-0-15225";"I … I am shocked. Madam Whim has spoken about this treasure for centuries and now I'm holding it. This will be the most unique item in our care.\n\nHere, take your reward. Mortals lives are notoriously short, but I hope yours won't be."
"116521668-0-15247";"Now, I provide you with the reward I promised and we part company. Skrix and I have a great deal to discuss. I'd invite you to join us, but let's be honest. Carrying on a conversation with him is exhausting.\n\nYou have my thanks, sera. Farewell."
"116521668-0-15255";"This operation of theirs, anyway. Those documents I took suggest the Ascendant Order is a lot bigger than this group of buccaneers, but that's not our problem.\n\nHere's your cut of the job, plus a little thank you from me."
"116521668-0-15256";"So, you plucked and butchered the Elf and his gryphons, huh? Hope you brought back the haunches for a feast! If not, there's plenty of meat on your bones I'd like to sink my teeth into.\n\nDon't worry, you'd only bleed a little."
"116521668-0-15257";"Hah, a cushy assignment if ever there was one, but even I wouldn't want to spend every day in swamps and dungeons.\n\nTake your reward and shake the sand out of your boots. You can show me your tan lines later."
"116521668-0-15258";"I'm almost curious what some outfit with a name as puffed up as the Ascendant Order was doing lurking in a tidal cove like some pirates. Don't suppose it matters after what you did to them.\n\nGood work, Undaunted."
"116521668-0-15260";"Yes, walker, yes! Don't let Za'ji's fretting sour the mood. With the plans he has, this one will be able to outfit the Perfect Pounce like a great ship of legend.\n\nAnd for that, he offers his greatest gratitude! And gold, very much gold."
"116521668-0-15261";"Word in the camp is you handed out a right beating to the denizens of Shipwright's Regret—not the least being those Dreadsail pirates and their captain.\n\nNext time you go fishing for Sea Elves, invite me along. We'll see what bites."
"116521668-0-15262";"Shipwright's Regret is back on the map, thanks to you. Never mind that it's a graveyard. Tidying up all those rotting dead, clearing out the overgrowth, and chasing off looters. Sure you'd rather not be a groundskeeper?\n\nHere. You earned this much."
"116521668-0-15263";"Ghouls, killer trees, and Sea Elf pirates. You've got some real fortitude. Come back sometime after hours so I can put it to the test.\n\nHere's your well-earned reward, you big hero."
"116521668-0-15279";"Yes. I understand how to keep this realm's chaos from pulling me apart now. I'll be fine, thanks to your efforts as my proxy. If I had to be out of phase with reality, I'm glad you were there to help me!\n\nPlease accept this with all my gratitude."
"116521668-0-15295";"Disappointing. Without the stolen item, no restitution can be made. I must account for that in my judgment of these thieves.\n\nBut I would not be able to pass judgment at all without your assistance. Here, your reward, as the Stricture dictates."
"116521668-0-15296";"Without the stolen item, no restitution can be made. Without the thieves, I can not render judgment. \n\nThe limits of mortals are exhausting, but I will assume you at least made an effort. Here, your reward, as the Stricture defines it."
"116521668-0-15318";"An inexperienced adventurer managed to free his grandmother's spirit from the heart of Dagon's realm? Sotha Sil, it's only through your power that I'm even alive!\n\nI—here, a small sample of the gifts I'll give to the Temple as soon as I return."
"116521668-0-15319";"As far as I can tell, the Mother Stones worked. They worked, the spirits are free, and we're alive! I know that last bit was mostly your doing.\n\nHere. I can't say when I'll make it to Mournhold. This is all I can give to the Tribunal now."
"116521668-0-15335";"Precisely! Here. The favor I said Zenithar would bestow on anyone who assisted me in his praise during this day. The lord who looks fondly upon labors of love always shows good fortune to those who learn from him. \n\nGo, with Zenithar's blessing."
"116521668-0-15336";"You've proven yourself a reliable and prosperous child of trade, dear-heart.\n\nHere is the small reward I'm allowed to give out on Zenithar's behalf. Return on another festival day and I'm sure he'll favor you again."
"116521668-0-15341";"Ah, aren't they beautiful? One for each delegation invited to the peace talks. And this is for you. Take it with my thanks.\n\nAnd know that the Society of the Steadfast's coffers are very deep. You'll be paid very well for your continued assistance."
"116521668-0-15342";"And neither do we. We're not even sure they're still alive, but we must hope.\n\n Your help has been invaluable thus far, my dear, and you've earned every piece of gold in this pouch. We'll find the alliance leaders and unmask the Order. We have to."
"116521668-0-15343";"If this map really points to sites important to the Ascendant Order, then it's our best lead so far.\n\nHere, my dear. Take this with my thanks. With your continued help, we'll find the royals and discover who's behind the Order before long. We must."
"116521668-0-15344";"Soon, my dear. First, prepare yourself while I finish making the needed arrangements. We'll head to Amenos in due time. For now, remember all we have learned thanks to your efforts. \n\nTake this as payment. You more than earned every gold piece."
"116521668-0-15345";"I don't know how to properly thank you! Tarrinore's alive because of you. And we have more scoria than our client wants.\n\nTake this. It's all I can spare now that Tarrinore's injured."
"116521668-0-15347";"No one will look in this graveyard for the items thought to be lost within the keep. And I will watch over them. Your task is done. You have my thanks in all things.\n\nHere, I promised you the treasures forgotten in the graveyard. Take them."
"116521668-0-15349";"No, thankfully. Her wool is damp and dirty, which I find offensive, but she's safe. I'll clean her right up in no time.\n\nPlease take this as a thank you from the both of us. I'm glad that not everyone is as rude as those Hadolids."
"116521668-0-15354";"We find a way to make a life on this island. From what I've heard, finding a way off is nearly impossible.\n\nHere's the payment I promised. I guess we'll probably run into each other again some time. Amenos isn't that big and we're all stuck here."
"116521668-0-15359";"Oh, not for a while yet. We're still preparing the secure site on High Isle. But if the Ascendant Order strikes again, I know who to contact. You really are quite remarkable, my dear. And this is for you, compliments of the Society of the Steadfast."
"116521668-0-15360";"I've been thinking. I have a place here on High Isle. But I think I want to expand my horizons. I would like to see more, do more, learn more. \n\nIf you could use a strong and loyal knight of High Isle in your travels, I'm up for anything."
"116521668-0-15364";"Vanisande showed me to her treasure. It's not the wealth of bounty I was hoping, but I might just secure a loan for a ship when all's said and done. My dream of being the next great Captain Maul is close!\n\nHere's your cut. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-15368";"You saved the alliance … and Nari. At least one of those accomplishments is worth the payment I promised. I'll make sure these documents wind up in the right hands.\n\nOh, and if you see us around in the future, pretend you didn't."
"116521668-0-15374";"So Prince Irnskar told me. We'll get to that. First, you need to rest. And I need to make sure our royal guests remain safe.\n\nFor now, take this. As long as I can count on you, there's more where that came from."
"116521668-0-15375";"Let's just say I have faith. Look what we accomplished. We know who wears the helm of the Ascendant Magus, and we learned the Order is moving against All Flags. We have a chance to stop Count Damard yet!\n\nTake this, dear. You more than earned it."
"116521668-0-15376";"I knew you were special the moment I saw you, my dear. The Ascendant Magus hoped to topple thrones, yet instead his threat brought the alliance leaders together. And you showed them peace is worth fighting for.\n\nTake this, with my deepest thanks."
"116521668-0-15381";"Indeed, champion. I confess that I was beginning to fear I'd be trapped amid these crumbling ruins forever. This day I finally follow Lady Garick on the greatest voyage of all!\n\nThank you again. May you bear the Sacred Shield with honor!"
"116521668-0-15383";"I couldn't have done it without your help … or, of course, without Dame Madach. I'm sure wherever she is she's smiling, singing, and toasting our success.\n\nI'll need to return to the order and let them know what happened. Thank you, my new friend."
"116521668-0-15388";"It does my aches good to hear that. We'll let House Mornard know what happened here. Spare others some pain.\n\nVeslyn says you convinced at least one of them to give up piracy. You hauled more than was asked of you. Take this, with my thanks."
"116521668-0-15392";"Now? Now life returns to normal here in the grove. Though without the binding wards, we may need to be more compassionate to the Evergrowth. We want it to stay happy.\n\nOh, and before I forget, this is for you. From the Stonelore Circle, with thanks."
"116521668-0-15395";"Ember the Sorcerer. Heh, I like the sound of that. But that can come later. First, take this. It's not much but you deserve it.\n\nI think we made a good team today. If you ever need a sorcerer who has your back, let me know.  We'd have some fun."
"116521668-0-15404";"I promise, I will never let the Prowler out of my sight again. Oblan, though? If Oblan wanders off again, he is on his own.\n\nHere. For your trouble. And if you're ever looking for somewhere to share a drink and a song, you're always welcome aboard."
"116521668-0-15411";"My plan worked! Or, it looks like it's working. You believed in me even though I know I wasn't entirely prepared for this adventure. At least I wasn't when we set off. Thank you.\n\nTake this. It's from my father and I."
"116521668-0-15414";"Thank you, friend. I am official large delegate again! Just think of the great diplomatic triumphs that are sure to come because you helped me.\n\nI do not have much gold left in purse, but what I have is yours."
"116521668-0-15421";"Nightmares, abductions, mad experiments … Viralaine has much to answer for.\n\nThank you, adventurer. We're doing good work here. And because of you, we can start again and do it right. The Society of the Steadfast is in your debt."
"116521668-0-15426";"Easy as piercing a gorapple with my tusk! If you prefer to work alone, go see Wayllod. If you want to work as part of a group, then talk to either Parisse or Druid Peeska.\n\nHere's a modest advance to show how serious we are about these opportunities."
"116521668-0-15434";"Ah, and a beautiful specimen it is! Marcelle never understands the importance of legends, and that's why we bested her this day.\n\nAnyway, I never would have succeeded without your assistance. Take this, with my compliments."
"116521668-0-15444";"Excellent, dear! You saved Emeric and the others from the Ascendant Order and ended the threat of the Magus. Plus, you salvaged the talks and restored the hope for peace. \n\nTake this. This is your day as much as anyone's! I have to address the crowd."
"116521668-0-15446";"That's a trick the Sea Witch never shared with me, thank the Divines. Wasn't enough to spare her from you though. I'm not sure what scares me more. Glad you were on our side, marine.\n\nLet's get you home and to the purser!"
"116521668-0-15447";"That's a trick the Sea Witch never shared with me, thank the Divines. Wasn't enough to spare her from you though. I'm not sure what scares me more. Glad you were on our side, marine.\n\nLet's get you home and to the purser!"
"116521668-0-15448";"That's a trick the Sea Witch never shared with me, thank the Divines. Wasn't enough to spare her from you though. I'm not sure what scares me more. Glad you were on our side, marine.\n\nLet's get you home and to the purser!"
"116521668-0-15449";"The Sea Witch's talisman? Aye. She wouldn't have parted with that if she still drew breath.\n\nNow we can finally drive these filthy Dreadsails from our waters once and for all. Well done."
"116521668-0-15450";"The Sea Witch's talisman? Aye. She wouldn't have parted with that if she still drew breath.\n\nNow we can finally drive these filthy Dreadsails from our waters once and for all. Well done."
"116521668-0-15451";"What devilry is this? I'm no mage, but I've faced Taleria enough times to know it reeks of her sorcery. Perhaps the druids can cleanse it and ensure that Sea Witch never troubles us again.\n\nYou've gone above and beyond the call of duty. Our thanks."
"116521668-0-15452";"Good, good. <<1>> will brief you on your mission himself. It is of the highest importance.\n\nAnd don't forget to make use of the resources here in the hold. Take every advantage we can give you."
"116521668-0-15458";"I heard! That's good. But for now, let's just enjoy this victory. I'd almost given up hope of finding my friends. Thanks to you, I have faith again. I couldn't have done this without you. Jhaka and I both owe you so much more, but here, take this."
"116521668-0-15459";"For now, I think we should just be proud of what we accomplished. You helped me find not one, but two of my friends—people I've been searching for, for years. And thanks to you, Silverslip and that strange glyph might lead us to Song. Thank you."
"116521668-0-15460";"You helped save Song and restore my family. My heart's lighter than it's been in years. I don't want to get emotional but … you have no idea how grateful I am that you're in my life.\n\nAdventuring alongside you is an honor. Please, take this."
"116521668-0-15477";"We saw justice done and put right something I should have sorted a long time ago. This adventure has reminded me how important it is to be honest with the people you care about.\n\nSo, hey. Your friendship means the world to me. Thanks."
"116521668-0-15479";"Traveling with you has made me a better knight. A better person. You are one of my very best friends.\n\nMy life changed when we won the Sapphire Tourney together. And now, I can't wait to see what awaits us next."
"116521668-0-15481";"I may just take a page from the Lady Investigator's book and send the knight commander a letter. We both just have to accept Aurelia is going to do what Aurelia is going to do, and get out of her way.\n\nIn any case, thank you. You're a good friend."
"116521668-0-15483";"Sure enough. This is definitely one of the map fragments I've been looking for. Balki actually managed to find it, to his credit. Shame he couldn't claim the reward.\n\nWell, you finished what he couldn't, so here you go. Thanks again."
"116521668-0-15484";"This is exactly what I was hoping Ferone'd find. I didn't expect it would cost her life. That's just how it is out in the Systres. Fickle as the sea.\n\nThe map's appreciated. Make good use of the reward before misfortune finds you too."
"116521668-0-15485";"This is definitely the fragment I was looking for. At least Rhadh's death wasn't for nothing. I was hoping to share in the reward with him once I had them all together. Damn shame ….\n\nBut that's not of concern to you. Here's the gold I owed him."
"116521668-0-15486";"Hah! Finally, I can bribe my way back into the good graces of the crown and retire in my place of birth. Thought I'd never see the day.\n\nHere's your share, partner."
"116521668-0-15488";"An urgent task? Ah, well. Nothing ever changes. But I live to serve!\n\nHere, my annual stipend, just as I promised. Thanks again for saving Lady Laurent, ending the curse, and restoring a piece of the archipelago's history. Now I must see to m'lady."
"116521668-0-15520";"Then it is my honor to furnish you with your first pair of decks, and welcome you wholeheartedly to the Gonfalon Chapter of the Roisters Club!\n\nMay good fortune shine on you, my friend. I am eager to see you put those cards to good use!"
"116521668-0-15522";"Very well. This is a simple reward, true, but you earned it!\n\nPerhaps tomorrow you will find even greater success, yes?"
"116521668-0-15523";"Very well! A single sugar-tart is better than no tarts at all, yes?\n\nHere it is. Enjoy your reward, walker."
"116521668-0-15525";"Very well. Kishka hopes you to enjoy this gift. You earned it, yes? Winning two matches against talented opponents is no small feat.\n\nYou let Kishka know when you want to try for three victories, though, yes? That is when it gets really exciting!"
"116521668-0-15526";"Here you are, walker—the finest prize Kishka can offer. Of course, there is more. This one will ensure that the Roister's Club commits these victories to their lists.\n\nYour legend grows, yes?"
"116521668-0-15528";"Excellent work! I knew I could count on you. The druids of the Eldertide Circle detest mainlanders. And some of them are very powerful spellcasters, too.\n\nHere—your reward!"
"116521668-0-15530";"Just a little something from the chapter's strongbox.\n\nNow, then. You have decks, you are versed in the rules and familiar with your fellow competitors … truly, you have all you need to step into formal play! We proudly welcome you to our chapter!"
"116521668-0-15532";"Well done, adventurer! I will see that these get to Sir Charles for a proper burial. And here's your payment, just as we agreed. \n\nNow remember, there's always a job that needs to be done around the archipelago. Come see me when you want more work."
"116521668-0-15533";"You are quite welcome. Now, for the formal part. On behalf of the Roister's Club and our revered Gonfalon Chapter, I hereby grant you intermediate ranking, with all the rights and privileges due. That, and a hefty reward, too!\n\nCongratulations!"
"116521668-0-15537";"Of course you did! I had great confidence in you. Let's hope the Sable Knight's horrible curse is broken for good.\n\nTake this, with the gratitude of House Dufort. I'd say you've more than earned it!"
"116521668-0-15540";"This one is impressed! Winning back to back games? It is like eating twenty bowls of cane-honey custard in one sitting. Easy for Marunji, yes, but hard for everyone else.\n\nCongratulations, walker!"
"116521668-0-15541";"Very good! This came from sister-Kishka's fancy-crate. Even I am not allowed to look in the fancy-crate!\n\nOf course, you earn more than a sumptuous prize. Your rank grows, too! Well done!"
"116521668-0-15543";"Fine work! I know Wildhorn started out by protecting his vale, but once a faun gets a taste for killing he won't stop until he waters the forest with the blood he spills.\n\nHere's your payment, as promised."
"116521668-0-15544";"And with hardly a burn or a singe in evidence. Well done! I will inform Morgan Osina that this portion of her research is complete. Here is your pay.\n\nRemember, I always have work for an adventurer of your caliber. Come back and see me soon."
"116521668-0-15549";"Great, you've bought us valuable time. Hopefully we can find a more permanent solution soon, but that should at least prevent imminent, molten disaster for the time being."
"116521668-0-15554";"You're amazing! You really did it! Now, it's up to me to recreate our masterpiece. I hope it wasn't just a fluke … mostly for Hilgrim's sake. Because I'll kill him.\n\nHere, take this as a reward. You helped us more than you can know."
"116521668-0-15557";"Excellent. Borzadar and House Dufort will be pleased to hear that. I don't think the count or duchess could stand the thought of those foul creatures contaminating their property.\n\nHere's your pay. I'll have more work for you in the future, I'm sure."
"116521668-0-15558";"That's a relief! High Isle's serpents are dangerous enough without strange Sea Elf enchantments. And you didn't drop any of the eggs … that I see, anyway.\n\nThe druids will be happy to see balance restored. Your reward, hero."
"116521668-0-15568";"Dead? Then Advocate Inwaldawin was correct in her assumptions. Very well, I will get these documents to her and she can match the names to her list of missing prisoners.\n\nThank you again, adventurer. And as promised, here is your pay."
"116521668-0-15573";"You did well! My only regret is that you couldn't bring back their heads to console the families of those who already fell victim to those cruel fanatics. But their reign of terror is over now, isn't it?\n\nYour reward, brave hero."
"116521668-0-15576";"Excellent work! Hopefully digging the brine glands out of those shelled monsters wasn't as slimy and disgusting as it sounded. Blech!\n\nHere's your reward. On behalf of House Dufort and alchemists everywhere, thank you!"
"116521668-0-15583";"Now, we prepare for the final round! The last challenge on the long road to master status and ultimate victory in the tournaments!\n\nWe have a brief respite, though. For now, take this reward and bask in the glow of victory. Welcome to advanced play!"
"116521668-0-15586";"That's excellent news! I will inform Levus Cavus straight away and he can let the alliances know. The pirates will strike again, but that's a worry for another day.\n\nHere is your pay. And remember to come see me again when you want another job."
"116521668-0-15592";"I'm not an expert on such matters, so I'll have to take your word for it. I'll deliver these to Nivathil so she can advance her research.\n\nHere's your pay for a job well done. Come back soon and I should have more work for you."
"116521668-0-15595";"Great, you've bought us valuable time. Hopefully we can find a more permanent solution soon, but that should at least prevent imminent, molten disaster for the time being."
"116521668-0-15603";"Then, let's get to it! I, Razhamad, Roister's Club game-baron and master of the Gonfalon Bay Tribute Chapter, hereby declare you a Tales of Tribute master. May you continue to succeed and excel in the years to come.\n\nCongratulations, my friend!"
"116521668-0-15606";"Now? Now we try to return to normal. The grove won't be the same without the archdruid, but we'll make do. Of course, our relationship with the Evergrowth needs to change as it isn't bound anymore.\n\nOh, this is for you. From our circle, with thanks."
"116521668-0-15608";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-15625";"Very well. This is a simple reward, true, but you earned it!\n\nPerhaps tomorrow you will find even greater success, yes?"
"116521668-0-15626";"Very well. Kishka hopes you to enjoy this gift. You earned it, yes? Winning two matches against talented opponents is no small feat.\n\nYou let Kishka know when you want to try for three victories, though, yes? That is when it gets really exciting!"
"116521668-0-15627";"Here you are, walker—the finest prize Kishka can offer. Of course, there is more. This one will ensure that the Roister's Club commits these victories to their lists.\n\nYour legend grows, yes?"
"116521668-0-15629";"Very well! A single sugar-tart is better than no tarts at all, yes?\n\nHere it is. Enjoy your reward, walker."
"116521668-0-15630";"This one is impressed! Winning back to back games? It is like eating twenty bowls of cane-honey custard in one sitting. Easy for Marunji, yes, but hard for everyone else.\n\nCongratulations, walker!"
"116521668-0-15631";"Very good! This came from sister-Kishka's fancy-crate. Even I am not allowed to look in the fancy-crate!\n\nOf course, you earn more than a sumptuous prize. Your rank grows, too! Well done!"
"116521668-0-15649";"For now. But while the Pale Worm is dead, another vampire lord will appear to take his place. That is the way of things.\n\nAnd when evil steps from the shadows, my blade shall be ready to greet it."
"116521668-0-15653";"We stopped Archdruid Devyric. But I doubt he was working alone. This isn't the end of … whatever those conflagrations started. No, they won't stop here.\n\nWe would have lost the Stonelore sacred seed without you. Thanks for helping me. Take this."
"116521668-0-15654";"You dealt Archdruid Devyric a killing blow so strong you knocked the Spirit of Air out of him? I'm impressed and a little jealous. Maybe you can show me how you did it sometime. \n\nHere's your reward. Be sure to stop by again, I've got my eye on you."
"116521668-0-15655";"Firesong isn't the most fearsome name. \n\nStill, you faced wolves, atronachs, and druid magic. That's worth a key. Maybe the Firesongs will put up more of a fight tomorrow. Or think of a name that's actually intimidating."
"116521668-0-15656";"Word has it that the Stonelore Druids made a garden in your name. Normally, that would be a trite reward. But, they also created statues of you and that—along with all the blood you spilled—is definitely worth a key and your cut."
"116521668-0-15659";"Seems the lich you fought was a druid. It tried to kill the whole crew.\n\nAh, but enough grim tales. Fortune truly smiled on us today, mate. I found what I needed, and you had an adventure! Here, take some treasure I found. You earned it."
"116521668-0-15660";"Storming an unknown Dwarven base usually ends in someone gutted by a trap. But you? I bet you didn't even give it a second thought. That's what makes you truly Undaunted! Take this reward with pride."
"116521668-0-15661";"Putting undead into their grave isn't hard. Keeping them there? Now that's the real problem. By crushing that lich you've ensured that island stays free of any stray ghosts still floating about.\n\nFor that alone, you deserve this reward."
"116521668-0-15662";"Not everyone can solve a mystery that's haunted pirates for years. Maybe they'll start swapping tales about you now.\n\nBut rum-soaked legends shouldn't be your only reward. Here's the key you've earned."
"116521668-0-15667";"My friend, your help has been invaluable! I'll update my pamphlets to include only the best food and locations to visit. And feel free to tell everyone you meet—the best tours of the archipelago are Visour's Tours!\n\nTake this, with my gratitude!"
"116521668-0-15691";"After their actions here on the mainland, I wouldn't put it past them. The Firesong revealed themselves as the path-traitors they are. I need to warn my circle and get Frii to Galen.\n\nTake this, friend. Maybe we can work together again in the future."
"116521668-0-15701";"First, Raz will sleep for a week. Then he will report to the queen. This one thinks he may just leave Roneiia's name out of his report. \n\nBut you, five-claw, are someone worth mentioning. Here. As promised, your reward. Moons keep you safe."
"116521668-0-15703";"I should think so. There are still a few druids hanging around, but I don't think they have any more of those strange crystals. Then I can get paid.\n\nSpeaking of which, here's your compensation. I appreciate hard work at a reasonable price."
"116521668-0-15705";"We've been hesitant for too long, unsure of where the next attack would come from. Now we know. It's coming from inside our circle, from someone we considered an ally. A friend.\n\nTake this, my friend. We'll deal with Bacaro soon enough."
"116521668-0-15706";"Don't worry about them. Without a leader, they'll quickly fade away. Now we just need to proceed with the peace talks. We're back on track and the archipelago is safe, thanks to you.\n\nNow, take this. Count Stefan and I wanted you to have it."
"116521668-0-15708";"I had no interest in druid quarrels until she threatened my son. Bah! Stefan warned me something dangerous was afoot. I should have listened. \n\nHere. House Mornard always pays its debts. There's more to come if you continue to aid us, mercenary."
"116521668-0-15709";"Now we make use of the time we have and prepare the city's defenses. Gather allies and do what we can to keep the sacred seeds safe. But no matter what happens, I'm honored to fight by your side.\n\nHere, friend. My father wanted you to have this."
"116521668-0-15713";"This one is now proud to call you an initiate of the Dragon Defense Force of Elsweyr.\n\nGo and demonstrate your Dragon-slaying prowess to the Draconic menace, and spread your knowledge to others who may yet join our ranks."
"116521668-0-15716";"A guardian? You bring mixed tidings, friend. I can't bear the thought of Laurel in Firesong hands. But if Frii can help us defeat Archdruid Orlaith, I'll swear my house and life to the cause.\n\nThank you. Perhaps we're not helpless, after all."
"116521668-0-15717";"My house long ignored the concerns of druids. Old grievances led to the madness of Archdruid Orlaith. No more. The people of Galen—druids, nobles, and townsfolk alike, are one. I will lead them as such.\n\nThank you for that opportunity, my friend."
"116521668-0-15720";"Oh, my poor cousin! How will I fix this? Octin was the brains and—no. I'll figure something out. I have to.\n\nHere, I said I settle my debts and I meant it. You saved me and I do appreciate that. I'll find a way to do the same for Octin. Somehow."
"116521668-0-15721";"What? I told you to choose Joslin! You let her become a tree? It's … no. Forgive me, friend. You did what you had to do. I'll make sure Joslin has a good life as a tree.\n\nAnd this is for you. Joslin will drop fruit on me if I didn't pay our debts."
"116521668-0-15727";"Magnificent. This one is proud to call you an initiate of the Elsweyr Defense Force.\n\nIf we had more soldiers like you, we could wipe these Dragons from the face of Tamriel. Thank you for your service, my friend."
"116521668-0-15728";"I knew you were the right one to send to Glimmertarn. Thank you for helping Laurel. You're a most valuable ally. Here, take this. The least I can do for your continued efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll make sure Rahval and the seed get to Vastyr safely."
"116521668-0-15735";"I'll prepare better next time—study the lay of the land, maybe ask more questions. I still have a lot to learn about this life.\n\nBut I do know how to reward loyal partners. This should cover your cut of the payment."
"116521668-0-15738";"Yes. Gwen is strong. She'll recover quickly. But she would have been lost to me without your help. Please, accept this. You ended a great danger and rescued my Gwenaelle from a terrible fate.\n\nI just wish the Chronicle was still with us."
"116521668-0-15740";"By honoring the legacy of my two mentors, my father and Archdruid Rahval. Now that Vastyr is safe, we can concentrate on stopping the Firesong.\n\nBut before that, you helped save my city from utter ruin. Take this with my heartfelt thanks."
"116521668-0-15743";"Tava's red feathers, I can't believe it. Not only is the treasure real, but Kiko and I actually put our brains together and finished what we set out to do.\n\nOf course, we couldn't have done it without you. Here's your reward as promised, mate!"
"116521668-0-15756";"Did you hear that Faun's joyful bray? Happy Fauns are hungry Fauns, and they'll discover the plants soon enough. Once the berries become part of their diet, the wolves will leave them alone.\n\nHere. My purse isn't large, but you helped save this herd."
"116521668-0-15768";"This job was a good reminder—don't trust others to make a plan for you. As Zeira says, a careless thief is a thief in jail. \n\nHere's your cut. You earned it, partner."
"116521668-0-15803";"Excellent work!\n\nTake this payment with my gratitude, traveler."
"116521668-0-15807";"If you've got the steel to work alone, talk to Juline Courcelles. If you don't mind cooperating with other sellswords, I hear Druid Gastoc and Druid Aishabeh have some dangerous work.\n\nAnd take this. A gift from the house for your aid."
"116521668-0-15818";"Oh, wonderful! They're so pretty! Now our gracious guests can have a keepsake to remember their tour of Galen forever and ever!\n\nHmm … I wonder how long these things glow?"
"116521668-0-15820";"These are really good! The scorch marks on the edges really sell them. Now all it needs is a splash of color, a fun little caption, and we'll have ourselves a Savage Systres Tour flyer.\n\nYou've earned this reward, friend!"
"116521668-0-15822";"And look at how cute they are! With these adorable little critters on display, Savage Systres Tours will surely be a success!\n\nI don't know which one I love more. It's impossible to choose! Oh, right— your reward!"
"116521668-0-15824";"My, these are lovely! And they just grew all over Fauns' Thicket? Perhaps I should add it as a stop on the tour. With a few reasonable precautions for our guests, of course.\n\nHere. A good job earns a good reward!"
"116521668-0-15826";"That's wonderful news! I'd better get ready for a flood of applicants coming my way any moment now!\n\nAnd I'd better get your payment ready, too. You have brought Savage Systres Tours one step closer to reality, friend!"
"116521668-0-15828";"You placed the markers? Y'ffre's Path is as safe as can be, then! Sir Aval will be so pleased.\n\nIf you see him, send him my way! Or maybe I'll just give the handsome knight a visit …. Oh! And here's your reward, of course!"
"116521668-0-15840";"And I've just finished drying the client's tears from my robes. Her son had to pull her off of me!\n\nI hope you'll excuse me if I show a bit more restraint in showing my thanks to you!"
"116521668-0-15842";"Excellent! These sure look like prime … specimens.\n\nLook, I don't know much about Calysa's research. But I'm sweet on her, and I knew getting these moths would make her happy. And when she's happy, I'm happy. So again, thank you."
"116521668-0-15844";"Splendid work, my friend! Better to see the chimera's end than let it toil forever under control of the Firesong.\n\nThat aside, if I had to contend with three heads … I think I'd rather be dead."
"116521668-0-15846";"You have no idea how grateful our healers will be for this. And our wounded initiates, even more so.\n\nIt's outcomes like this that are the exact reason we Stonelore seek harmony! Everyone fares better when we work together."
"116521668-0-15848";"Excellent work! So long as the shrines remain intact, the druids should be able to make amends with the earthen spirits. And it'll be safe now that they aren't avoiding a rampaging chimera.\n\nTake this payment with my gratitude, traveler."
"116521668-0-15850";"Yes, I do. As we conclude this business with Lord Bacaro and the Ascendant Order, I want you to know how much your help has meant to me. Take this as payment for services above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nNow, I have a speech to deliver, my dear."
"116521668-0-15868";"I manifest at many points. I am at my death. I am at your creation. Ah. I did not realize this about you. Interesting.\n\nNonetheless, we have succeeded. Here. Your payment as promised. You will spend it wisely."
"116521668-0-15869";"Those Telvanni—such sneaky little worms. Always creeping around in the shadows, whispering to each other about their plans for breaking the world.\n\nGood thing you decided to break them instead. Here's your reward, Undaunted."
"116521668-0-15870";"Flying around through time just to clear out some Dark Elves? Now that's true dedication. You didn't happen to hear the outcome of any Tribute tournaments, did you? I could place a few bets.\n\nHa! Just kidding. You did great work, Undaunted."
"116521668-0-15871";"The word's out—you put the fear into those Telvanni. Chasing them through the past and future before crushing everything they built? That's the true Undaunted way!\n\nHere's your reward. Now take some time for yourself."
"116521668-0-15889";"Excellent. I knew you were the right one to ask for help. Thank you, adventurer. You've given us a welcome reprieve for now. Let us hope to be rid of this threat once and for all someday.\n\nHere, take this with the Stonelore Circle's thanks."
"116521668-0-15905";"Excellent. I knew you were the right one to ask for help. Thank you, adventurer. You've given us a welcome reprieve for now. Let us hope to be rid of this threat once and for all someday.\n\nHere, take this with the Stonelore Circle's thanks."
"116521668-0-15912";"What's this? About my Unu? Hah! Not a chance. For the rest of my time on Galen, Unu won't leave my side. Perhaps I'll carry him on my head! Or in my pocket? Hmm, no. These breeches would burn too easily. \n\nYou have our thanks. Here, take this."
"116521668-0-15913";"Oh, Zeht's tears, my eyes are already watering! I hope you're ready for a fiery demonstration, friend! It's about to get hotter than the Alik'r during Sun's Height!\n\nStep back, and watch me pave Galen's streets with flavor!"
"116521668-0-15916";"Thank you so much. You can't know how much this means to me. Having a piece of him back is more than I could have dreamed. It's as if his heart has been reunited with mine.\n\nI can't thank you enough, kind stranger. Please, take this."
"116521668-0-15958";"Old grievances led to the madness of the Firesong, the rage of the Ascendant Order. No more. The people of Galen—druids, nobles, and townsfolk alike, are one. I will lead them as such.\n\nThank you for giving me that opportunity, my friend."
"116521668-0-15982";"Oh, Zeht's tears, my eyes are already watering! I hope you're ready for a fiery demonstration, friend! It's about to get hotter than the Alik'r during Sun's Height!\n\nStep back, and watch me pave Galen's streets with flavor!"
"116521668-0-15983";"I think whoever hired the vampires is connected to the threat that Hermaeus Mora has foreseen. I shall make inquiries and meet you in the peninsula when the time is right. Await my summons.\n\nFor now, take this. A reward from the Prince of Fate."
"116521668-0-15987";"Ah, yes. Torvesard. Well done, proxy. Now we have a name for the spider at the center of this web. Key, rite, and dream. These are the threads we must follow to unmask our foes' true goal.\n\nTake this, with the thanks of Hermaeus Mora."
"116521668-0-15988";"The Necrom Bindery? I thought that place was abandoned. Of course I'll meet you there.\n\nOh, and the abbot authorized me to give you this. For exposing Blightcrown and saving the Necropolis. They got away with part of the relic, but we'll get it back."
"116521668-0-15989";"So, end of the world stuff. Well, that's something interesting at least. Obviously, you're going to need the help of a Telvanni magister. Luckily, you have me.\n\nLet me conjure up a small reward from my old vault. A stipend for services rendered."
"116521668-0-15990";"You want to help? Me? What a strange mortal you are. But resourceful. I'm not sure I would have learned anything at all without your assistance. Here's the gold I promised. You earned it.\n\nThis problem bears contemplation. I'll find you again soon."
"116521668-0-15991";"I would have it no other way, proxy. We followed Hermaeus Mora's enemies from one end of Apocrypha to the other, and we learned what they seek. You have done well, and the One Who Knows wants to reward your efforts. Take this.\n\nThen … we shall see."
"116521668-0-15992";"They cannot. Not usually. Hence all the trouble that Torvesard and his allies went through to reach this point. At least you saved the Telvanni masters and recovered Meln's Black Book. Well done.\n\nWhile I ponder next steps, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-15993";"If there was an imminent danger, Hermaeus Mora would summon us. For now, bask in your victories, proxy. You faced down Daedric Princes and saved Apocrypha and Nirn.\n\nTake this. Thanks from the One Who Knows. And a sign of friendship, from me."
"116521668-0-15994";"Oh, trust me, I'll make sure the Consortium does what is right. To send an auditor in place of soldiers? Unbelievable. The safety of the people of Necrom is my highest priority.\n\nTake my thanks, and everything that I owe you."
"116521668-0-15995";"Why can't both be true? I told you what you needed to know. But yes, I hoped the soldiers would know only your face.\n \nStill, I promised you a reward. Take it. We should part ways before we attract any more unwanted attention."
"116521668-0-15996";"I must examine this and see if there's a way to undo the effects. The Hushed are lost forever. But now that the corrupted scrolls are gone, maybe they'll forget their belligerence. The Daedra, too.\n\nThank you. Please, accept this reward."
"116521668-0-15997";"Not a clue! But Vorm seems excited enough. I think I'll just lay them down and let him work his magic, you know?\n\nAnd here, even if he stays a petulant little pamphlet you still deserve a reward. Take it!"
"116521668-0-15999";"We can no longer trust the Apogee to protect these items. It weakens and will fall. Your efforts give us time to relocate the secrets within.\n\nTake this reward. Your service has concluded."
"116521668-0-16000";"Oh, thank the Three! You made it! \n\nI couldn't finish my aunt's funeral without her cherished shield. Her spirit will rest easier knowing it still protects her remains. With my deepest gratitude, this payment is yours."
"116521668-0-16001";"Sorry. He would've known something was amiss if he'd seen my face. I've got a guilty expression, you know. Here, let me make it up to you."
"116521668-0-16006";"She did, did she? I suppose you did go out of your way to help a woman with a writ. Here you go, payment as promised. Never let it be said that Naryu Virian doesn't pay for services rendered. Thanks again, hero.\n\nNow, for my final bit of business."
"116521668-0-16007";"Then let us take a moment to remember all we accomplished … all you accomplished, proxy. You defeated Blightcrown, expelled Vaermina, and saved Apocrypha, thereby saving Nirn.\n\nTake this. The One Who Knows insists you accept this reward."
"116521668-0-16008";"You went beyond our expectations. Although the outcome was not as I predicted, we still freed the Cenotaph from the Dreamcarvers. And that is worth a reward.\n\nHere, mortal. Take it."
"116521668-0-16009";"Not me. The creator—Sotha Sil— did. My directives must be detailed and precise as I oversee many systems here in Kemel-ze. \n\nI have one last directive to fulfill before beginning my new duties. Here, this is payment for the services you rendered."
"116521668-0-16010";"Good. The Lord of Eyes and Arms must be all right with me leaving the gallery. I can explore, and read, and find myself again with this new truth.\n\nYou helped me and I helped you. Cipher Frielvi didn't give us treats but I saved one for you. Take it."
"116521668-0-16011";"Perhaps one day you'll hear the harmonious songs of the chorus. But for now, know that all the minds housed within the Rectory are grateful for your help. As am I."
"116521668-0-16012";"Hezehk's secret. When my debt to Madam Whim gets too low, I'll mess up a job on purpose. The Voidprowlers have a clan, yes? I have her.\n\nThat's it! That's the most valuable thing I can give you. Oh, fine. Here's some shiny whatever this is."
"116521668-0-16013";"Yes! Thank you for freeing us from this trap. To think my Prince would go to such lengths to protect the knowledge kept here …. A harsh punishment, but I must not question my master. \n\nIt isn't much, but I want you to have this. Thank you, friend."
"116521668-0-16014";"I recognize my handiwork. I'll be a hero returning this to the shrine. It's a false victory. But no one needs to know that besides us.\n\nTake your payment. If we meet again, I hope it will be after I've taken the upper hand on the Lark of Rosgard."
"116521668-0-16015";"If my freedom is the price of being with Nathyn, then I'll pay it. To be with my love is better than having to wander the world alone.\n\nThank you for keeping me safe and helping me see the best choice, stranger. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-16016";"Excellent. If you prefer to work alone, talk to Ordinator Tilena. If you prefer to work as part of a team, find Ordinator Nelyn. If you wish to test your mettle, speak with Ordinator Tandasea.\n\nAnd take this. A gift from the Temple for your aid."
"116521668-0-16029";"Excellent! It's said that knowledge is power, but sometimes brute strength is the remedy a situation requires. I suspect by helping Hermaeus Mora to defend his realm, you were protecting our world as well. \n\nHere—your reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-16031";"Yes, yes, of course. It's strange. If I didn't know better, I'd say this prism was alive. One could almost mistake its pulsing energy for a heartbeat. It's beautiful, isn't it?\n\nAh, of course, your payment. I haven't forgotten!"
"116521668-0-16032";"I wish I could say I enjoyed our adventure together, mortal. However, you and I both know it was far too distressing to be fun. Still, this Watchling is certainly grateful for your help.\n\nTake this reward. You earned it."
"116521668-0-16033";"Going after the Reformer is a different job for a different day. Hunting my hunter is going to take time and patience.\n\nFor now, take your payment. And if you'd like me watching your back wherever you're headed next, send for me. I'll be there."
"116521668-0-16034";"I'll reach out to Mevei. She sounded like she wanted to help us more, right? I'm not used to having people in my corner. Aside from you.\n\nWe're going to do this. No matter what it takes. We're going to be the Reformer's end."
"116521668-0-16035";"We have to save Dimik-ei. We have to find the Reformer, and we can't let him know we're coming.\n\nI need time plan how we're going to do that. But when the day comes, be ready. I'm going to need your help."
"116521668-0-16036";"Mevei and Federo can call on me whenever they need my skills. But I hope they'll call on me as friends, too.\n\nReynila wanted me to choose my own path. With Sondivel gone, thanks to you, I can finally do that. By your side, or finding my own way."
"116521668-0-16037";"Together, my new cohort, we began the work of understanding the nature of fate. We put an old friend to rest.\n\nSomeday soon we'll repair the Key. But for now, accept my promised coin with enthusiastic thanks. Onward and upward!"
"116521668-0-16038";"A superlative idea. And look at what we've already accomplished. The Fateweaver Key improved, frayed fates sewn back into my line, and the adversary confronted once again.\n\nHere, cohort, your due. With my humble thanks. Spend it judiciously."
"116521668-0-16039";"I expected nothing less. And consider our accomplishments. We've confirmed the adversary's goal, denied him the Interval Chamber and, finally, I see the seriousness of my actions.\n\nFor now, accept this stipend with my vehement thanks."
"116521668-0-16040";"Exceptional! Together, we've repaired my fateline, banished my adversary, and ensured the safety of the Skywatch citizenry. \n\nI'm deeply proud to be your traveling companion, cohort. Take this. Along with the thanks of a grateful arcanist."
"116521668-0-16041";"Part of the memory has been remembered? But reality has not unraveled, so we must still have time to make this right.\n\nVaermina and her allies continue to assault Apocrypha, but freeing Hermaeus Mora was a victory. Well done! This is for you, proxy."
"116521668-0-16045";"And so the scribes return to their rightful place as Hermorah's quiet observers. You've done an extraordinary service. Hermorah will be informed of your great deeds, Keshargo will see to that.\n\nHere, take this with his gratitude."
"116521668-0-16046";"Is it true that Valinna summoned a giant spider? Or was she riding the spider? The rumors aren't clear yet. Imagining it is enough to get my blood pumping. What I wouldn't give to tear one of the legs off.\n\nHere's your key and cut, spider slayer."
"116521668-0-16047";"What, did the Scribes not give you a literary reward? Do librarians even know how to wield anything more mighty than their quills? \n\nStill, a victory is a victory. Here, take this key."
"116521668-0-16048";"Those scribes can't be the cowardly passive observers they pretend to be if they voluntarily walk through unstable rifts.\n\nAnd you followed them into the Deadlands? Your key and cut, for not ending up as dead as you could have. I'd hate to lose you."
"116521668-0-16055";"Thank Vivec, I had lost all hope. I'll destroy the replica and learn from this day. \n\nThe only thing I did right was enlist your help. May we meet again. And the next time I cross the Lark of Rosgard, may it be the last."
"116521668-0-16061";"Oh, yes. I plan to impress Madam Whim to no end. A good review from her and every powerful entity in Oblivion will be knocking on my door, so to speak.\n\nHere, some treats for you. I always reward my creatures when they perform adequately."
"116521668-0-16062";"Well, I'll likely lose my job over this, but what the Consortium did was wrong. These people needed help and they sent me. But I'm done being useless. Know that I'll raise plenty of noise before I'm done.\n\nThank you. Take this, you earned it."
"116521668-0-16113";"Thank you, traveler, for helping me rescue my father. Herm'us Mora will now come claim his bounty, but for these final moments, I will think of my father. Here, for your efforts."
"116521668-0-16114";"My son is disappointed, but you respected my wishes, and for that I am in your debt. Let me offer some small reward for your aid, and know that, should you find yourself in these lands again, my spirit will always be with you."
"116521668-0-16116";"On further consideration, I find Dreynis's notes are more than enough. Even his margin scribbles have valuable insights about portal creation and trans-planar travel.\n\nHere, your payment. And I'll even mention your name in a footnote!"
"116521668-0-16121";"I made it this far—I can work and wander a bit longer to have Nathyn by my side for good someday. Sathile and I are going to find that cure.\n\nThank you for helping me see the best path forward, stranger. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-16145";"Vanton relaxed the moment Ansuul's presence departed. He's sleeping peacefully. This one doesn't know if Ansuul was killed—or if she can even be killed in her own nightmare. But her presence is gone from this room.\n\nYou saved us all. Thank you."
"116521668-0-16146";"Vanton relaxed the moment Ansuul's presence departed. He's sleeping peacefully. This one doesn't know if Ansuul was killed—or if she can even be killed in her own nightmare. But her presence is gone from this room.\n\nYou saved us all. Thank you."
"116521668-0-16147";"Vanton relaxed the moment Ansuul's presence departed. He's sleeping peacefully. This one doesn't know if Ansuul was killed—or if she can even be killed in her own nightmare. But her presence is gone from this room.\n\nYou saved us all. Thank you."
"116521668-0-16148";"Thank you. Hopefully this artifact is less dangerous now. We can finally study the magic it possesses.\n\nPlease, take this for your help."
"116521668-0-16149";"Thank you for returning this to Twelvane. Maybe we can finally study it without encountering any terrors of the mind.\n\nHere. Take this for your work."
"116521668-0-16150";"You found the Dreamstone inside Vanton's mind? Astounding. We have so much to learn about this relic. Of course, you've done us a great service in saving Vanton. But this is an incredible find!\n\nThank you."
"116521668-0-16151";"Good. We need all the help we can get to defeat Ansuul the Tormentor. Wizard Twelvane would say we need your help to save Vanton, too. But, I'm more scared of Ansuul at the moment.\n\nOh, and take this for agreeing to help us."
"116521668-0-16157";"You did? Let me see? Ah, none of them are damaged. Well done. I'll see that these are shipped out immediately. \n\nYou've done well. Here's your reward."
"116521668-0-16160";"Either the Camonna Tong were no match for you, or you crept though Camonnaruhn undetected. Either is a feat worthy of reward. \n\nHere. I'll see these goods are distributed properly."
"116521668-0-16162";"I must say, I'm impressed. I've heard many stories about Quires Wind—none of them good. I know not the purpose of these items, but I appreciate your aid in gathering them.\n\nAs promised, here's your reward."
"116521668-0-16163";"You made it out of the Disquiet Study? Impressive! I see that you've reclaimed the temple secrets I asked for as well.\n\nHere's your reward for braving such dangers."
"116521668-0-16165";"You managed to find precisely what I asked for. Bless the Three! I hope you cleaned those teeth up. Disgusting creatures, those Dremnaken.\n\nHere is the reward we discussed."
"116521668-0-16167";"It saddens me to see so many of our lost ship manifests here, but now we can identify the missing and comfort their kin.\n\nAnd we know the Tide-King is responsible for these shipwrecks. You've done well. As agreed upon, here is your reward."
"116521668-0-16182";"It is done? You've beaten Vro-Kuul-Sha? The Buoyant Armigers are good warriors, but they tend to bite off more than they can chew. At least we can now put their souls to rest.\n\nHere's the promised reward."
"116521668-0-16184";"That's what I was hoping to hear. It's a pity that young Favel didn't survive, but these notes should come in handy.\n\nThe Ordinators appreciate your assistance. We'll have other jobs for you in the future."
"116521668-0-16186";"You've done well, my friend. Defeating Valkynaz Dek and rescuing our people is a great service to the Tribunal.\n\nHere is the reward as agreed upon. And check back for more work soon."
"116521668-0-16188";"Good to see you back, my friend. The Prime Cataloger has felled many great warriors. And you've got the tomeshell molts! Blessed Ayem will be pleased.\n\nHere is your payment, as promised. We'll have another job for you soon."
"116521668-0-16190";"Lord Vivec will be most pleased. This arcanist gained too much power. This arcane residue should allow Vivec to understand his new power and devise proper countermeasures.\n\nThe Ordinators thank you. Check in with me often for additional work."
"116521668-0-16192";"Excellent. Corlys was no better than the beasts he trafficked in. By the grace of the Three, his suppliers will share the Chainmaker's fate soon enough.\n\nAccept this reward. We'll have more work for you soon."
"116521668-0-16226";"An excellent point. Never let it be said that Naryu Virian reneges on a promise. After this, I need a long, hot bath. Hmm, that's not an invitation, hero. Maybe next time.\n\nAh, but I have one other thing to deal with first."
"116521668-0-16243";"Right. Just another day of service to House Telvanni. These attempts aren't uncommon, so I must always be on my guard. I just need to make an example of those who try to kill me. And fail."
"116521668-0-16246";"It's only through your efforts that we have a chance to rebuild. The Remnants will rise again and last for eternity. All thanks to you.\n\nThis outcome was unexpected. Nonetheless, you earned this. We offer it in gratitude."
"116521668-0-16261";"This is troubling. Tlaxalt should have known better than to meddle with the Numinous Grimoire. I must look into this.\n\nThank you for bringing back this book, and the news of Cipher Tlaxalt's fate. Here. A reward for your trouble."
"116521668-0-16262";"Poor, foolish Dreyla. Something dangerous is afoot, and the Numinous Grimoire is in the middle of it. I must investigate.\n\nThank you for bringing back this volume … and for telling me about Cipher Dreyla. Please, accept this reward."
"116521668-0-16263";"I didn't know Cipher Nelfynn well, but she deserved better. I must give this matter my attention. Who would want the Numinous Grimoire? And why?\n\nThank you for bringing back this volume. Here—a small reward for your trouble."
"116521668-0-16264";"I can almost understand Akacirn's desperation. No matter how much we learn, mortality means that one day it will be lost. Yet trying to cheat that fate by stealing from others is foolish.\n\nThank you, traveler. As promised, a reward for your help."
"116521668-0-16288";"Excellent! It's said that knowledge is power, but sometimes brute strength is the remedy a situation requires. I suspect by helping Hermaeus Mora to defend his realm, you were protecting our world as well. \n\nHere—your reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-16290";"Excellent! It's said that knowledge is power, but sometimes brute strength is the remedy a situation requires. I suspect by helping Hermaeus Mora to defend his realm, you were protecting our world as well. \n\nHere—your reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-16292";"Excellent! It's said that knowledge is power, but sometimes brute strength is the remedy a situation requires. I suspect by helping Hermaeus Mora to defend his realm, you were protecting our world as well. \n\nHere—your reward, as promised."
"116521668-0-16331";"I can't thank you enough for playing your part. You did wonderfully and I am freed from my terrible predicament now!\n\nI don't know how to repay you. Or wait, I do. Here's the coin I promised."
"116521668-0-16337";"Did she now? Too bad she went and got herself killed. Typically, I wouldn't take on someone else's debt, but I think I can make an exception. Nice work, hero. You earned this.\n\nNow, time to finish my end of the contract."
"116521668-0-16341";"I'm confident that my sister and I can nullify Hermaeus Mora's curse with time and the right ritual. Much preparation will be needed though. Thank you for bearing witness, even if it wasn't the spectacular achievement my father promised."
"116521668-0-16353";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-16356";"That's true. The filers feel safer and I can let my guard down a little when I research things. It's a definite improvement. \n\nI know Hermaeus Mora has been rewarding you for your efforts along this journey, but I'd like to give you something, too."
"116521668-0-16363";"It seems undoing the curse's hold on my father came with a price. My sight. But, I am happy to hear my father's voice once again. Thank you for your help.\n\nThis reward feels a paltry sum in comparison to the aid you offered, Traveler."
"116521668-0-16377";"Very well. I'll pass these pages along to Yensa. Let us hope that she will tread a little more cautiously than her father."
"116521668-0-16379";"Tralise it is! I'm certain she's anxious to get these pages sealed and hidden away. A pity for such knowledge to once again be lost, but such is the way of things."
"116521668-0-16398";"You did great work in setting the Infinite Archive to rights. The next time you want to travel these halls, I would be more than happy to pay you for your skills again."
"116521668-0-16406";"<Pinned to the bounty board is a note from General Thoron:>\n\n""I received word of your success in slaying enemy Arcanists, soldier. Accept this bonus pay. It has been well-earned!"""
"116521668-0-16407";"<Nailed to the bounty board is a scrawled note from General Khamagash:>\n\n""When you've killed your quota of enemy Arcanists, take your reward."""
"116521668-0-16408";"<Attached to the bounty board is a message from General Dar-Liurz:>\n\n""Your prowess in hunting enemy Arcanists has gained you great renown. On behalf of Grand Warlord Zimmeron, I leave this reward for your efforts."""
"116521668-0-16410";"Right. Good. Good. Then maybe you'll still help. And I won't have insulted our last hope. It's fine!\n\nHere. I'm told you mortals find this valuable."
"116521668-0-16412";"That the Recollection and the Mirrormoor Daedra seek to restore Ithelia to power. They caused the new forest and wildburn devastation. And Ithelia wanders West Weald, starting to remember.\n\nFor helping me reach these conclusions, take this reward."
"116521668-0-16413";"We exposed Nantharion as leader of the Recollection. When Vashabar hears about this, they'll tear the crown from his head. He can lead the Recollection, but he can't hide anymore. And we saved Skingrad from a wildburn.\n\nHere, friend. You earned this."
"116521668-0-16414";"Leramil believes these relics are the key to defeating Ithelia and her Recollection and Daedric allies. Oh, we still need to figure out when and how to use them. But thanks to you we have what we need to save West Weald.\n\nTake this, friend."
"116521668-0-16415";"By saving Skingrad and Vashabar from Nantharion's designs, you taught both sides to stand against a common enemy. Whatever comes next, all the people of West Weald will face it together. I thank you for that.\n\nIt's not much, but please, take this."
"116521668-0-16416";"That's tomorrow's problem, friend. You stopped the Recollection and you held back the forces of Mirrormoor. The people of West Weald can handle what's left of Ithelia's servants. We're free to find our own way forward now.\n\nThanks to you."
"116521668-0-16417";"Yes. He most definitely would. I can see the threads of fate coalescing to a point. We near the end of this path and whatever awaits us.\n\nYou have done well as fate's chosen. Take this reward and gather yourself. I shall do the same."
"116521668-0-16418";"Ithelia is gone and can never return, but the damage she caused to reality may still be a concern.\n\nFor the moment, let us reflect on what this victory has cost us. And take this reward, in recognition of your efforts. The One Who Knows insists."
"116521668-0-16419";"Do not tease me with nonsense words, friend. I am just grateful that Gadayn has been returned to us. And that the One Who Knows has given me one more reward to bestow upon you.\n\nNow let us allow Beragon to make his speech and celebrate our success."
"116521668-0-16420";"For now, yes. From things Torvesard said, I expect we will find him in West Weald. I shall confer with Beragon about the area and alert you when you are needed. Thanks to you, even though Ithelia is free, we still have a chance to preserve our world."
"116521668-0-16421";"I can't thank you enough. You, and the Singer, helped us make our dream come true. Without you, who knows where Clen and I would have ended up?\n\nI'll pray for you, traveler. Y'ffre keep and protect you for all the rest of your days."
"116521668-0-16423";"Do not downplay your role either, friend! You forget, Mizzik was a bumbling mess chasing a sneeze-inducing beast—ahem, Betu—until you arrived.\n\nYou deserve a reward for your work, but know that this one is in your debt."
"116521668-0-16424";"With the portal closed and the Daedra on the run, the remaining Recollection forces aren't enough to threaten Skingrad. But I'll get the Legion to send more soldiers, just in case.\n\nHere. The pay I promised. The Legion always makes good on its debts."
"116521668-0-16425";"I predicted that the tangled threads of fate were related to Ithelia's release, but how could I know she was the direct cause?\n\nYou have served the One Who Knows very well in this effort. Here is the reward I promised."
"116521668-0-16426";"I've never seen a seed like this before. It feels wrong. You're working with Leramil, right? She needs to know what we discovered here. Meet us back in Skingrad. I have a townhouse there.\n\nOh, and take this. You more than deserve it for helping me."
"116521668-0-16427";"Excellent. I've arranged payment for your efforts. Did Narsis come with you? I know, probably still taking notes for his next dissertation, I expect. Should I go after him? Eventually, I suppose. He gets cross with me when I fuss about him too much."
"116521668-0-16429";"Ursilia is set on taking control and turning the vineyard and winery into a profitable enterprise. I have no doubt she'll succeed. \n\nAnd speaking of succeeding, your help was invaluable in stopping Lord Gallio. Please, take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-16430";"I'll help bury the dead and then take Abolisher to Skingrad. Maybe Leramil or Beragon can make sense of it.\n\nI want you to know I appreciate your help here, comrade. Take this and consider your commission with the Legion over. For now."
"116521668-0-16431";"Tham? Right. I need to be here for him, the way he was for me. Help him, whether he decides to remain a vampire or seek the cure. It's the least I can do.\n\nRemember, I don't like owing favors. So take this. I want you to have it. For all your help."
"116521668-0-16432";"Marvelous! This is great progress toward assembling every volume of Theories on Apocrypha. Thank you. You're a true friend to the archive. \n\nI promised you a reward, didn't I? Here you go."
"116521668-0-16433";"Great! Well! That was easy. Guess the world's lucky we're not both necromancers or we'd be able to claim these ruins for ourselves!\n\nNot that I want that. Obviously. Who wants to be a necromancer? Anyway, here's your reward."
"116521668-0-16434";"If you hadn't arrived when you did, the skies would be much darker. Leftwheal, and myself, owe you a great debt, traveler. A debt that this reward only begins to pay."
"116521668-0-16435";"Now we can finish our trek to market and sell the wine as planned. In addition to turning Ruri over to the authorities, I'll also let the Legion know what's going on in these caves.\n\nYou recovered my inventory when I thought all was lost. Thank you!"
"116521668-0-16436";"Gods, Haldain …. I have to look into his death. Figure out what happened and find justice where I can. \n\nBut that will be my battle. Thank you for finding me. I hope Haldain's at peace. Take this, with both of our thanks."
"116521668-0-16437";"Thank you, friend. As promised, here is a token of my gratitude. Hopefully, our paths may meet again under less grim circumstances. Now, I need a hot bath to wash off the stink of the grave. By the smell of it, you could use one, too."
"116521668-0-16438";"While I don't appreciate the chosen imagery, I get your meaning. Yes. Though, the long road to betrothal is a lonely path, I'll gladly walk it.\n\nThank you, traveler. You've earned this gold as well as my deep respect."
"116521668-0-16439";"That's an excellent question. It depends on which cohorts are nearby and what else they may be dealing with. I hear we've been having trouble with Wood Elves and Daedra recently, you know.\n\nHere's the payment I promised, courtesy of the Legion."
"116521668-0-16440";"Excellent. Now we wait for Legion reinforcements to arrive. Given the current state of the Weald, that could take time, but at least the warning has gone out.\n\nThank you for completing this mission for our fallen comrade. Take this for your service."
"116521668-0-16441";"I think they trust me! This is such a breakthrough for my research. See how they're not attacking us? That's proof that they're not hostile anymore. \n\nI couldn't have done this without your help. Thank you. Please accept this."
"116521668-0-16442";"Oh yes! I knew I could count on you. Now I can finally make some progress on my long-awaited translation!\n\nI promised you a Verse for your incredible work. Here, it's a suitable reward for you."
"116521668-0-16443";"Excellent! Exactly the supplies I needed. I can't thank you enough, friend. \n\nOh, Wait! I can! Here, take this."
"116521668-0-16458";"A patrol to last a lifetime. I brought you in to help with an unstable portal, and look at everything we've done. Explored an ancient library, met a talking crow. And apparently revived an ancient form of magic?\n\nCan't wait to see what happens next."
"116521668-0-16477";"We fought through the entire Oathsworn Pit. If any Recollection remain in there, they'll be scattered and leaderless. Just the way we want them to be. \n\nHere, you spilled enough blood to appease Malacath's need for revenge."
"116521668-0-16478";"The Recollection defeated each of the lodge leaders, you defeated the Recollection. You're the new Pitmaster.\n\n When I sent you there, I assumed you'd help the Oathsworn, but I should have known better. Here's your reward, Pitmaster."
"116521668-0-16479";"As if showing those Oathsworn fighters what a real warrior looks like wasn't reward enough. \n\nStill, you managed to clear the pit of all invaders and that merits a key. I hope you remember this the next time Malacath's worshipers start recruiting."
"116521668-0-16480";"The Oathsworn aren't slouches, for them to get overrun with enemies—well, I'll just say the Recollection knew what they were doing. Which only makes it more impressive that you defeated them. \n\nYour key and cut. For showing how Undaunted you are."
"116521668-0-16488";"Excellent. If you prefer to work alone, talk to <<1>>. If you prefer to work as part of a team, find <<2>>. If you wish to test your mettle against truly monstrous foes, speak to <<3>>.\n\nAnd take this. An incentive for … well, your incentive."
"116521668-0-16489";"Oh, how beautiful. If they turn out to be harmless, I might actually keep one of these. But thank you. The last thing West Weald needs right now is a new poisonous insect flittering about.\n\nHere, I'm sure this compensation is adequate."
"116521668-0-16491";"You have my gratitude. Knowing you stopped the Recollection's ritual will help me sleep easier. Of course, who has time to sleep these days? I certainly don't.\n\nHere's your payment. Take it with the thanks of the Legion."
"116521668-0-16493";"Excellent work, adventurer! I knew we could count on you. Each Daedric incursion we defeat brings us one step closer to victory in this strange war.\n\nHere, you earned this reward. And the gratitude of the West Weald Legion."
"116521668-0-16495";"Hmm. Perhaps a bit lighter than when we loaned them out, but these things happen. I shall catalog the contents and return them to the storehouse. They will be available to requisition again soon.\n\nMany thanks, mercenary. Your payment, as promised."
"116521668-0-16501";"Gods, they certainly smell rather Reachy. But if returning these baubles to Caddach's diplomat will please the count, then I too am pleased.\n\nNow, take this for your troubles. I suspect you will find it more valuable than what you have just given me."
"116521668-0-16504";"Oh, that is good news! If word of the insults contained in that invitation reached Count Calantius, heads would have rolled—specifically, mine.\n\nThe Legion appreciates your efforts and hopes you find this compensation acceptable. And so do I."
"116521668-0-16507";"Well done! I'm not squeamish, but the claws and fangs of this unnatural beast make my skin crawl. I'll deliver them to a Legion mage and let them deal with it. Hopefully, they'll tell us much about the creatures.\n\nNow take this with my thanks."
"116521668-0-16509";"Ah, let me see. Traps, crumbling walls, Ayleid spirits … yes, yes, just what I expected.\n\nI suppose we'll need to delay the renovation project until we can spare a cohort to clear the place out. Ah, well. So it goes. Here's your pay."
"116521668-0-16514";"Admirable work. I'm not happy our assumption about the legionaries proved true, but it's better to know their fate and to have their armaments back under our control than to let an unfinished report linger.\n\nHere, take this. You earned it."
"116521668-0-16516";"Well, that's a load off my mind. This should discourage the Goblin tribes from attempting anymore foolish schemes. Of course, I still must deal with the paperwork.\n\nBut my burdens aren't yours. Here's your payment."
"116521668-0-16518";"I am glad to hear it. Until we understand how these Daedra are invading our realm, we will continue to monitor any new threats. And I am sure my superiors will continue to expect me to work magic with our resources until then.\n\nHere, your payment."
"116521668-0-16520";"Oh, these are wonderful! It will take me some time to make sense of it all, but I see orders of battle, supply lines, correspondence concerning potential targets—this is a gold mine! And you took out a few leaders? Remarkable.\n\nYou earned this."
"116521668-0-16522";"That's perfect! Hopefully the warnings will be enough to keep everyone away until I can dispatch a Legion cohort to clean out any lingering dangers. The nobles will have to survive without visiting the lake for a while.\n\nHere's your payment."
"116521668-0-16596";"Normally, I wouldn't bother with the Echonir, but I am intrigued. I may need to look into this trinket more.\n\nYou won't get anything from the Great Eye for protecting the Echonir, but take this."
"116521668-0-16597";"Take your reward. From the rumors I heard, you earned it. \n\nYou defeated an army large enough to invade Maelstrom? If you're so thorough and effective at every task I set for you, maybe I should start to think of other things you can do for me."
"116521668-0-16598";"I heard about the Blind. Seemed like she put up a good fight. But you bested her all the same and caught the attention of Fa-Nuit-Hen. That's impressive. \n\nTake your cut."
"116521668-0-16599";"I heard you fought so well that you entertained Fa-Nuit-Hen without stepping foot in one of their arena challenges. That's no small feat.\n\nHere's your key and cut. You did well in continuing the Undaunted legacy of impressing Fa-Nuit-Hen."
"116521668-0-16659";"Ah, the Emblem! Excellent. And Narsis? He'll be along soon, I expect. My dear Narsis is always getting stuck somewhere. Here you go. I think this should cover your time and effort. Thank you."
"116521668-0-16679";"I'll present the evidence we collected to the magistrate in Skingrad. Help determine who takes over the ranch and quarry. Ontus needs those businesses to continue, though without the danger of fatigue fever.\n\nHere's your pay, deputy, with my thanks."
"116521668-0-16701";"Is that so hard to believe? I knew you were special the moment you pulled me from the ice. Thanks to you, Wisteria and Hyacinth are safe, and we're alive to mourn Oleander.\n\nAnd I promised you a reward. Here. Compliments of the Garland Ring!"
"116521668-0-16702";"We started with illusory riddles and ended with a prison break! Then Snapdragon revealed there's a traitor in our midst. \n\nWe'll need time to plan. For Snapdragon to recover. But, friend, we're going to find the traitor and root them out! Together."
"116521668-0-16703";"We lost Snapdragon, and I'll never understand why Wisteria is doing this, but we saved Hyacinth. That's something.\n\nWhat did she call you? A thorn in her side? We'll figure out her plan. And then we'll jab that thorn into the Ceythalmor's heart."
"116521668-0-16704";"Wisteria did everything she could to defeat us. She killed agents, tortured friends. She broke my heart. But thanks to you, I had the strength to face her. To stop the Ceythalmor plot.\n\nAs long as we're together, I'm ready for whatever comes next."
"116521668-0-16718";"Chef Donolon has spent his life trying to unite Tamriel through delicious desserts. My Jubilee Cake represents his passions and efforts—qualities he has passed down to me.\n\nNow, please, accept this with my thanks, friend. And try a piece of cake!"
"116521668-0-16725";"I would stand with no one else. We stepped into the light from the shadow of my tomb. Together, we struck against the darkness beyond the world. \n\nWe saved these cantors, and perhaps even made a friend in Krin'ze. I am honored to walk at your side."
"116521668-0-16763";"Magnus be praised. We've secured supplies for a full-fledged expedition, you've allied with your first Luminary, and the altar surges with new power. Not bad for a day's work."
"116521668-0-16771";"Excellent! You won't regret this decision, I swear.\n\nHere's the deed and key to the room. Took me a while, but I finally was able to take them back from the last tenant. Required more time in the sewers than I had hoped for, but hey, that's business."
"116521668-0-16774";"That's an excellent question. It depends on which cohorts are nearby and what else they may be dealing with. I hear we've been having trouble with Wood Elves and Daedra recently, you know.\n\nHere's the payment I promised, courtesy of the Legion."
"116521668-0-16817";"Incredible. With the Dragon's power amplifying the altar who knows what secrets you'll uncover out there in the world? \n\nWe pulled together, solved her puzzles, and followed fully in Ulfsild's footsteps. Not bad for a knight's work."
"116521668-0-16819";"I feel the same way. Just look at all the lives you made brighter. The altar is another wing stronger. And we reunited a man and his son for one final day together.\n\nThe Netch's antics were kind of moving. All because of you, my friend."
"116521668-0-16821";"Excellent work, adventurer! I knew we could count on you. Each Daedric incursion we defeat brings us one step closer to victory in this strange war.\n\nHere, you earned this reward. And the gratitude of the West Weald Legion."
"116521668-0-16852";"I hoped to tell Caelum how sorry I am. To let him know I grieved too, every day. Bring him some peace, perhaps. But I guess the only peace he could find was in death.\n\nThe Scarlets have a chance to find a different peace now. Thank you, friend."
"116521668-0-16855";"We explored my past and rediscovered Talbira's song. Azurah will guide us to confront these shadows when the time is right.\n\nFor now, let us leave Krin'ze to practice in peace. You and I can continue to build our strength so we are ready to strike."
"116521668-0-16856";"Oh, thank you! Just look at this little darling! I always wanted to raise a guzzard by hand.\n\nI'd almost given up on Marcien. I should've known they'd find a way to finish the job. Please, take this for your trouble."
"116521668-0-16857";"Ah, clever Marcien! Thank you for this, traveler. I've been waiting a long time for this guzzard. It's a tough one, you can tell by the thick leather of its wings. Such a handsome creature, reminds me of Belkarth.\n\nHere, a token of my gratitude."
"116521668-0-16858";"Oh, Versidue! My sweet little scaly friend, I was so lonely without him! \n\nThank you, traveler. You don't know what it means to have Versidue by my side again. Please, take this. It's the least I can do."
"116521668-0-16859";"Really? Marcien's always so careful, although I guess that explains why I didn't hear from them for so long. I'm just glad they're safe.\n\nThank you for everything, traveler. Please, take this. May the stars guide you on your journey."
"116521668-0-16860";"That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!"
"116521668-0-16861";"That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!"
"116521668-0-16862";"That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!"
"116521668-0-16863";"It's a good thing you did not keep this. See the light? Spirits and soul magic are not unknown phenomena, but they are not well documented. Keshargo doesn't know what Xoryn and his necromancers were capable of.\n\nHere. A reward for your good sense."
"116521668-0-16864";"It's a good thing you did not keep this. See the light? Spirits and soul magic are not unknown phenomena, but they are not well documented. Keshargo doesn't know what Xoryn and his necromancers were capable of.\n\nHere. A reward for your good sense."
"116521668-0-16865";"It looks like light is moving under the surface even as Keshargo holds it still. This glass is not like anything Keshargo has seen before. He'll bring it to Scrivener's Hall as a precaution. \n\nYou could have sold it. Keshargo will reward you instead."
"116521668-0-16866";"She flatters me, but she is right. I know exactly what happened. It's that fool Xoryn's fault. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nYou came here out of curiosity. That's a value I like to encourage. Accept this as payment for showing interest."
"116521668-0-16877";"A report? You didn't read it, did you? No matter. My report supersedes Ulrath's anyway. At least that Orc got what he deserved. How dare he contradict … er, disobey my orders.\n\nHere, the mercenary pay I promised. You earned it."
"116521668-0-16913";"Ulrath is a deserter? The coward! But that makes things simpler. Not that they'd ever take the word of a legionary over a captain. I'll make sure his report receives all the attention it deserves.\n\nHere, the mercenary pay I promised. You earned it."
"116521668-0-16914";"I must atone for my betrayal, both ancient and recent. At least we gained an ally in the high cantor. And we learned Ravith-morna's true intentions. \n\nGive me another chance, tamiit, and through our partnership I will find the wisdom to fix this."
"116521668-0-16915";"Of course! Just look around. You've made a huge impact on the Scholarium. You took another big step forward in your journey to master scribing. \n\nAnd, of course, you re-united two old friends. You should be proud, adventurer."
"116521668-0-16926";"A reward? Of course! On behalf of Skingrad, take this as your reward.\n\nAnd Legionary Luther must be rewarded too. He deserves a promotion! I'll need to check my budgets—oh, what am I saying? I'm the Count of Skingrad! Of course he gets promoted!"
"116521668-0-16929";"I suppose you're right. Refusing to acknowledge this facet is what allowed it to fester and grow so angry in the first place. \n\nThank you. Please, take this token of my gratitude. I know what I need to do now."
"116521668-0-16937";"With the portal closed and the Daedra on the run, the remaining Recollection forces aren't enough to threaten Skingrad. But I'll get the Legion to send more soldiers, just in case.\n\nHere. The pay I promised. The Legion always makes good on its debts."
"116521668-0-16944";"The altar is completely restored, every wing of the Scholarium is open and humming with power. And it's all thanks to you. \n\nTogether you and I returned Scribing, returned Ulfsild's legacy, to the world. I can't wait to see what you make of it."
"116521668-0-16948";"That's tomorrow's problem, friend. You stopped the Recollection and you held back the forces of Mirrormoor. The people of West Weald can handle what's left of Ithelia's servants. We're free to find our own way forward now.\n\nThanks to you."
"116521668-0-16949";"For the first moment in a span beyond counting, my soul is unburdened. I seek to explore this world, tamiit. To heal its wounds. Right its wrongs. And I can think of no better company than yours.\n\nPlease, take this. With my eternal thanks."
"116521668-0-16956";"I hoped to tell Marcan Caelum how sorry I am. To atone at the cost of my life, if that's what he chose. But death is no way to make peace with our deeds. It's up to us to find a better path.\n\nYou gave the Scarlets that chance, friend. Thanks."
"116521668-0-16957";"I … I suppose you're right. After twenty years, that evil night is finally over. I only wish Caelum had taken me instead.\n\nSorry, friend. Your payment, as promised. The Scarlets owe you more than coin. Now the others need me. And I need them."
"116521668-0-16972";"I've never seen anything quite like this. It feels wrong. I need to do some research. If you make it to Skingrad, look me up. I have a townhouse there.\n\nOh, and here's the pay I promised. I always try to help my friends. Especially the good ones."
"116521668-0-16973";"I'll help bury the dead and then take Abolisher to Skingrad. I know someone who might be able to tell us more about it.\n\nAs for you? Your service to the Legion is done. For now, at least. Here's the pay I promised. Take it with my thanks."
"116521668-0-16978";"With Ithelia free and more in control of her power, she still poses a threat. If you have an interest, come to Skingrad and meet with me again. We have more work ahead of us.\n\nIn the meantime, here is the promised reward. With my thanks."
"116521668-0-17003";"Unfortunately yes. Daedra can't be slain by mortal hands. He will return, but he can't harm us or anyone else until he regains his strength. When he does return, we'll need heroes like you once more."
"116521668-0-17022";"You did? This isn't some sort of farce? I'm impressed! I may have underestimated you.\n\nPlease, take this reward. I'll be sure to keep you in mind the next time I can pay a warrior for their work."
"116521668-0-17027";"The sight of them alone lifts my spirits. Oh, the stories they must have to tell.\n\nYou did well, friend. I'm willing to bet my lucky leaf that there are more remnants where those came from. But for now, leave me to my writing."
"116521668-0-17030";"I wish I could have seen their faces when you trounced them! Were they surprised at how well you fought? At the pain of defeat?\n\nI would say that I owe you for this, but I have enough keeping me in this plane. Accept this reward instead."
"116521668-0-17048";"He committed crimes against every army in Cyrodiil. He will stand and answer for his actions. It's only a matter of figuring out which alliance to bring him to. That will be my duty. \n\nTake this and leave knowing you saved lives here."
"116521668-0-17049";"I heard about the battle with those Atronachs, let me get a good look at you. \n\nI'm glad those Albus sorcerers didn't injure your face. If you keep fighting like this, I might have plans for it later. Until then, take your reward."
"116521668-0-17050";"I heard that family never recovered after one of their children died. Defeating grieving nobles doesn't sound too tricky, but I'm sure you can focus on more impressive things when you tell the others.\n\nTake your key while you think."
"116521668-0-17051";"I think you earned a key and then some. \n\nPlenty of warriors have left the Undaunted to join the war. Some have gone missing. You might've avenged them. You did the Undaunted a real favor. I'm not likely to forget it."
"116521668-0-17053";"Thank you. I hope you know how impactful your involvement here was. You avenged the Hel Netu and protected our Elder Scroll.\n\nI picked this up back in the tunnels. Khafdeed said I could give it to you. As thanks."
"116521668-0-17054";"Defeating a former emperor—disgraced or not— is almost the same as defeating a current emperor. As far as I'm concerned, you could be in the running for the Ruby Throne. You better remember me when you become powerful.\n\nUntil then, take this."
"116521668-0-17055";"Orpheon's dead? Good riddance to him and his ilk. Anyone too weak to hold onto the throne doesn't deserve the chance to sit their arse on it again.\n\nStifling an upstart tyrant is worth some gold. Take what we owe you."
"116521668-0-17056";"The Hel Netu warriors are not slouches. For them to be defeated …. I almost get jealous of you adventurers, but then I remember the enemies I faced. Maybe we'll get to fight side by side one of these times.\n\nUntil then, take your cut."
"116521668-0-17260";"He committed crimes against every army in Cyrodiil. He will stand and answer for his actions. It's only a matter of figuring out which alliance to bring him to. That will be my duty. \n\nTake this and leave knowing you saved lives here."
"116521668-0-17263";"Your words were like a warm breeze, gently clearing away the despair that filled my thoughts. Before we take action, I want to commend you and reward you for your service.\n\nAnd ask that you stay to finish this with us. For Merric."
"116521668-0-17335";"Any victory should be marked with a reward, no matter its size. Keep it up, champion. Strive for victory in every match, no matter who your opponent may be."
"116521668-0-17336";"And such perseverance deserves my greatest reward. Keep it up, champion. Strive for victory in every match, no matter who your opponent may be."
"116521668-0-17415";"We'll continue to protect Summerset from all that would harm it. Once my companions rebuild their strength, of course. In the meantime, we'll oversee the efforts of rebuilding Cloudrest.\n\nI couldn't have done this without all your help. Thank you."
"116521668-0-17416";"Just as the alliances, guilds, and heroes of Tamriel joined forces on Stirk to end the Planemeld, we must do so again to stop the Worm Cult on Solstice.\n\nYour actions were instrumental in revealing this threat. I hope we can count on you again."
"116521668-0-17431";"Your words were like a raging fire in the forest, incinerating the despair that was strangling my soul. Before we take action, I want to commend you and reward you for your service.\n\nAnd ask that you stay to finish this with us. For Merric."
"116521668-0-17448";"Your words were like a strong wind in the desert, scattering the sand of despair that was smothering my soul. Before we take action, I want to commend you and reward you for your service.\n\nAnd ask that you stay to finish this with us. For Merric."
