"3952276-0-41";"I have another use for you.\n\nBandits southeast of here stole weapons bound for Eagle's Watch, and now use my arms on the people of Northmoor. This will not stand! Steal my weapons back!"
"3952276-0-45";"The good lady Virolynn has the weapon you're looking for.  I delivered it to her myself.  You'll need to speak to her Chamberlain to gain an audience with her."
"3952276-0-51";"Crosswych...  Gargast is headed there, I know it.  You must hurry after him.\n\nIt is a small town in Dwynnen.  Speak to Warden Godwin, he looks after the town.  Who ever Gargast reports to...  will be in Crosswych."
"3952276-0-53";"As I wait for word from the High King, speak with King Sebastien - find out all he knows of this Shrouded Throne."
"3952276-0-56";"If you can spare the time, there is a problem you might help with. Angry spirits have been haunting the roads near the city. They threaten trade and commerce, and have been the woes of my flock. Perhaps you could ask around town for information?"
"3952276-0-61";"Unfortunately the courier rat has gnawed through his bindings.  He escaped his cell with the help of some thugs.  They were headed south.  I would appreciate it if you brought him back."
"3952276-0-67";"Camlorn is a mess of rumors and plots, and I am unsure where public opinion lies.\n\nIf you could, ask about the Hands of Northmoor around town. Be sure to find citizens who have heard of us-- I want to know the opinions of those who know who we are."
"3952276-0-73";"You've been a great help here. Now we need to look to fixing the tools that those damnable wolves damaged in the attack. I swear, it was like they were directed. Here, take this order to the blacksmith in Camlorn. He's Paine's brother, and can help."
"3952276-0-78";"My spies tell me there is to be a murder in Camlorn. You must bring this missive to Lord Sebastien. Hurry, I fear it may already be too late."
"3952276-0-79";"So, it's you. I must say, you're reputation precedes you. I'll warn you things are in a bit of a disarray right now, what with the murder and all. Speaking of which, I'll bet Investigator Oron could use your help."
"3952276-0-80";"My crops are failing this year. I don't understand why, Aquil seems to be doing fine, and we're in lock-step when it comes to methods of cultivation...\n\nCould he be sabotaging my crops so he can raise prices? I hate to think of it..."
"3952276-0-105";"Oh, my ruined leg... I can't walk. There's a Lurker! In the swamp. It came at us!\n\nWe should have kept to the road, but a detour would save us a day, and... oh, I hope Isabelle's safe. Aurore, my wife, went looking. Please find them? In the swamp?"
"3952276-0-123";"I have another task for you. This one is urgent. There have been reports of werewolves in the area recently and we need to track down thier location. Find evidence of thier whereabouts and return to me with the information."
"3952276-0-134";"The continuous attacks on the camp have left some of our troops lost in the forest. Go out and rally them back to camp."
"3952276-0-142";"Before we ready our blades against the threat of Coldun, you must know of the attack they are poised to strike in the darkness. The attack on the Veil. One that cannot be simply defended against with a sword.\n\nSpeak to Natasha, she knows more."
"3952276-0-143";"You've had but a small, bitter taste of what lurks in the land of the spirits, but what we ask of you now will determine the future of Alaygon. \n\nSpeak to my sister Kerry. She will tell you of the journey you must take to stop Coldun."
"3952276-0-153";"Gargast is merely a dangerous puppet. I suspect is he en route to inform his masters of the events that have transpired here - you must stop him!\n\nTake the bridge to the north of town.  And here, I believe you came to Aldcroft for this..."
"3952276-0-157";"Welcome to Grayborne, stranger.  Perhaps as an objective third party, you could resolve an issue we've been having.  Inquisitor Roche wants one of our villagers to leave on spurious grounds.\n\nCould you speak to him, see if you can change his mind?"
"3952276-0-171";"To summon Ranser's spirit, I need a powerful soul beacon - something to call out to him beyond the Mundus. One such artifact is the Chalice of Gwedrun. To channel enough power to reach him, I need another artifact - the Soulstone of Brall."
"3952276-0-180";"Calling a spirit back is difficult enough, but the turmoil I sense beyond the Mundus makes it doubly so. We must take care - when we summon Ranser, we must not summon anything else. \n\nNow, light the Holy Incense Burner on the left wall of the temple."
"3952276-0-189";"Dark Acolytes have disturbed the spirits of Glaes Maar.  They toy with those seeking only rest.  Take Crystalwan. Use it on four acolytes and bring them to the ruin's central altar. It will dispel the shield protecting them from just retribution."

"3952276-0-196";"My squad was scattered after the undead attacked us not far from the camp. I cannot go after them; the undead were led by...someone I once knew. Please, find the missing soldiers and send them home!"
"3952276-0-197";"Shortly before you arrived, the horde of undead besieging us increased fivefold.\n\nMy defenders lose hope. They need a champion. Rally them, hero - destroy the unholy creatures! Save the Redoubt, and you save Camlorn."
"3952276-0-198";"Go out there and bring my soldier's back."
"3952276-0-210";"All you must do now is spread my remedy through the lake.\n\nThere is a spongy island at the center of the lake that should easily absorb the remedy, and release it at a slow enough rate to avoid anything catastrophic. Pour the remedy on that island."
"3952276-0-231";"You must help us purge the undead from Silvermist Castle - destroy any you find. The angry dead attack in staggering numbers - I fear my brethren cannot hold them at bay much longer!"
"3952276-0-235";"You have the blessing, and I have fashioned for you a consecrated chain. Take it, and use it to bind the grave of the evil that rests here. It should be found in the most ornate part of the graveyard - such things often are."
"3952276-0-387";"You must help us purge the undead from Silvermist Castle - destroy any of the Undead Knights that you find and you will be rewarded."
"3952276-0-405";"Through all of the chaos and confusion my research book was almost destroyed.  Would you please try and recover the missins pages of it?"
"3952276-0-406";"After seeing the destruction and chaos that these creatures can do, we need to cleanse this dungeon of all evil.  Will you destroy all evil that you encounter?"
"3952276-0-410";"I suspect you are a Numinous, and should therefore report to the Queen at the Immaculate Tabernacle. State your name and condition."
"3952276-0-412";"Please help me find my midget.  He keeps wandering off to play with that damn wolf.\n\nI'm so sad without my midget at my side... please find him."
"3952276-0-418";"Greetings Adventurer. I'm in need of someone with your skills.  There is a magical tome hidden somewhere inside that I'm in dire need of. Could you fetch it for me?\n\nThere is no telling the evils abound... once you find it, return to me quickly!"
"3952276-0-422";"We know the largest threats in the keep consist of several bosses controlling the undead, most notibly the evil lord Therion Direblood himself. Take out these menaces to ensure our victory over this horrible evil that has befallen our lands."
"3952276-0-423";"I sent in a group of soldiers to charge an offensive. I fear they have been overwhelmed... or worse. Will you find my men and have them report back to me?"
"3952276-0-424";"This is infuriating. I've been trying to create a new spell to help rid of these undead, but I'm lacking a crucial ingredient. I need some Nightmare Dust, but it only drops from the Spectres roaming the depths of this place. Could you attain some?"
"3952276-0-427";"Baron Blackmoore's death needs to be a message. I'll make sure no one can get in from here while you go and make his death memorable. The coward will likely flee at the sight of you. Don't let him escape."
"3952276-0-428";"In taking our vengeance against the Baron, we mustn't forget our code. The Baron practices dark magics, and we must catch him in the act. There must be some dark creatures here. Find them, so that we can properly spread the tale."
"3952276-0-467";"Then I suppose you must. Whatever crimes he may be guilty of, you should know that Sir Hughes was always an honorable knight.  \n\nI simply must believe that his recent actions are caused by some form of insanity."
"3952276-0-521";"You must go to Azura's shrine at the Weeping Giant. It has been defiled, and I fear the Supernal Dreamers are involved.\n\nRegardless, the shrine must be cleansed. That is certain."
"3952276-0-575";"The Night Terror? Vaermina's own consort? \n\nThen this does not even compare to the threat the Omens represented! \n\nThe Night Terror. His name was once Galthis, and he was Vaermina's lover. Now he is her champion."
"3952276-0-657";"""I watched as Fadeel grew from a young colt into a proud stallion, and I have watched as Master Ozalan abused this noble creature, using him as a packhorse. I vowed that some day, I would buy Fadeel and set him free."""

"3952276-0-736";"Our leader, Sir Hughes, sent us a confusing message—to attack the Redguard army camped outside Alcaire Castle—an act that would destroy the Daggerfall Covenant.\n\nSome of us want to hear a justification before we do such a thing."
"3952276-0-737";"I've told the knights positioned around the castle to attack on our signal. \n\nThere's a siege horn mounted atop Firebrand Keep's main hall. If you are willing, I would ask you to go there and blow the horn. That will signal everyone to attack."

"3952276-0-1294";"My worthless apprentice. He stole one of my spellbooks. \n\nUnfortunately for him, I am no fool. That book is protected by a ward invoking, oh, Arkay or Akatosh. I imagine he regrets taking that book now."
"3952276-0-1341";"Good. Very good. Maybe along the way you would help me make my family proud?\n\nI want to come back from battle with something to remember it by, something I can hang on the wall and tell stories about. I want a war trophy."
"3952276-0-1346";"It's a fight that's long overdue, but it's Clan Murtag's fight, not yours.\n\nYour fight is with the ogres. I need you to kill Skull Crusher and stop the ogres from coming through the mountain."
"3952276-0-1383";"You … you would do that? I want it to be perfect. Breloth… she had such exquisite taste. \n\nMy father said she was 'high-upkeep', but I loved the way she just knew what she liked. She would've wanted her funeral to be special."
"3952276-0-1384";"It's just been bad luck, and lately, pure madness. \n\nLast week, the Ironhand Ogres attacked. They broke the levee, pillaged the place. The Orcs drove them back, but that was just the beginning.\n\nNow bandits are looting everything we have left!"
"3952276-0-1432";"Go clear that graveyard."
"3952276-0-1437";"It does. And by Mauloch, we need you! The Ironhand ogres have stopped us cold out there, and I can't afford to lose any more soldiers.\n\nWill you join my clan—Murtag clan—in this battle?"
"3952276-0-1477";"Seems like a waste to let wood rot. Take yourself, rotting before me now with nothing better to do. I can keep you busy, if you like. \n\nSee the branches under the forest trees out there? Get some of them for me and I'll throw you a few gold."
"3952276-0-1485";"The dreugh. They attacked us out of nowhere. \n\nMy husband tried to fight back. Those things wounded him and dragged him off!"

"3952276-0-1527";"I'm not sure, but that dead man-at-arms there was one of them. I saw them bringing dreugh eggs into town from the pools!\n\nBut they saw me, too. That's how I ended up here."
"3952276-0-1536";"Certainly! The bandits set everything on fire! The whole place is going up in smoke, and they're preventing us from putting the fires out!\n\nWe weren't prepared to fight. If you'll help extinguish the flames, it would be a tremendous favor."

"3952276-0-1637";"We're their only hope, but I have a simple plan, fun too.\n\nThe Dark Elves outnumber us by a little—actually, a lot. So first, you should create a diversion by setting fire to their tents and the stolen goods on the dock."
"3952276-0-1639";"Yes. Menevia is secure, but Vaermina's dark influence now seeps into the eastern region of Gavaudon.\n\nAzura's shrine there has been desecrated. It's the Supernal Dreamers again. I'm sure of it."
"3952276-0-1678";"The Supernal Dreamers. I should have seen this coming, but I failed and I need your help to set matters straight.\n\nThe Dreamers have captured Ingride Vanne, the owner of this farm, and I fear they have dark plans for her."
"3952276-0-1687";"You can steal from the bandits that which they stole from us! The motherless swine somehow got their hands on our tabards, and now they're robbing travelers on the road to Wrothgar! \n\nKill as many as you can, but mainly, get our tabards back!"
"3952276-0-1709";"My daughter! And if they've harmed one hair, I'll salt all Tamriel with their blood!\n\nI just have to find her. There was something in the dream … a cultist standing over Rozenn, reading a scroll. It's … it's on Nightmare Crag! Out of my way!"

"3952276-0-2193";"No. Tu'whacca is quiet now. He is not worried about you. He is more worried about me getting the temple cleaned up.\n\nI have a suggestion though. I think you should start your search in the city of Bergama."
"3952276-0-2222";"The Withered Hand launched a surprise attack against Tava's Blessing. They killed everyone and everything, even the livestock.\n\nThe strange thing is, they have not raised the dead."

"3952276-0-3930";"The Khajiit use chains and locks to bind the captured villagers. Find the key and set them free.\n\nIt seems so simple when I say it, but I'm sure this river hides jagged rocks. It is beyond my abilities."
"3952276-0-3933";"The Goblins have slaughtered many of my men. Even my eldest son has been fed to the funeral pyre. Now my youngest son, Bjorick, has gone missing.\n\nTroll's blood! These vermin seem unstoppable."
"3952276-0-3934";"The spiders encase their prey in cocoons. If <<1>> and <<2>> were taken, you'll probably find them trapped in one of those silken prisons."
"3952276-0-3936";"You must come of spirited stock. If you truly wish to help, speak to Hrogar up at the manor house.\n\nShor's bones, we need more like you at the hold. We've already lost too many to the Goblins."
"3952276-0-3938";"<The dog looks down the road and then back at you, as if it wants you to follow.>"
"3952276-0-3939";"Our guar. When the Covenant soldiers attacked, the guar panicked and ran into the sulfur pools.\n\nGuar aren't the smartest animals. By now, some of them have probably drowned."
"3952276-0-3940";"The Covenant attack. The worst part was the guar. They smelled our blood and stampeded.\n\nNow they're out here in the sulfur pools. Some drowned in the waters. Poor, stupid things."
"3952276-0-3941";"From what my spies tell me, <<1>> sent most of his forces to <<2>>. He shouldn't have the strength to hold <<3>>, but he's repelling our attacks again and again. \n\nI have an idea of how he's doing this. I don't like it."
"3952276-0-3942";"It's time to finish off <<1>> and his abominations. Then we can reclaim <<2>> for the Pact.\n\nHolgunn and Tanval have rallied the Nord and Dark Elf troops. They're just waiting for the signal that the gates are unbarred."
"3952276-0-3943";"We can't let <<1>> finish his ritual. Garyn and I are ready to dispel his wards.\n\nGet ready for a fight, soldier."
"3952276-0-3944";"Absolutely. Troll's Blood, anything could break us apart these days. How do you think the Argonians and my fellow Nords will react to this? If Tanval summons yet another magical juggernaut into the Ashlands, it could very well be the end of the Pact."
"3952276-0-3946";"It sounds like her Omen has been twisting the general's mind, convincing him to betray King Emeric. \n\nI suspected the Omen was manipulating events toward that end, but by defeating the ogres, you exposed its plan before it was ready."
"3952276-0-3947";"The Covenant has taken <<1>> and reinforced her walls. Strong Nord reinforcements are waiting for us in The Rift, but this fort keeps them bottled up.\n\nOur catapults can't crack the walls, and they've repelled every attack so far."
"3952276-0-3949";"It's a message from <<1>>, the leader of the Dark Elf quarter in Ebonheart.\n\nHe sends his compliments, and he wants you to help the town resist a nearby Covenant invasion."
"3952276-0-3950";"A Covenant force landed west of my town. Their leader, <<1>>, is known to be ruthless. She reports directly to General Serien.\n\nIf <<2>>  doesn't stand together, the Covenant is sure to sack our city, but our citizens are divided."
"3952276-0-3953";"A troop of Covenant soldiers happened upon the Keep. They attacked, thinking we were a military outpost. We tried to fend them off, but they fought past our defenses and managed to enter the vault. They smashed a relic, and unleashed the curse."
"3952276-0-3954";"Opening the reliquary must have awakened Keeper Vildras, its guardian spirit.\n\nVildras will know where this curse came from and how to stop it."
"3952276-0-3956";"It's dying. It was never healthy. This isn't Black Marsh, after all, so in the last few weeks, it's withered.\n\nWe've learned that House Dres is poisoning it. It's not enough to have enslaved us for generations. Now they want to carve our hearts out."
"3952276-0-3957";"My unit was sent here because a stableboy made it to Ebonheart and reported a slave revolt.\n\nOh, gods! He butchered them. He killed his own soldiers."
"3952276-0-3958";"The Cat-Man's inside the barn in the center of the plantation. Maybe he stayed to watch his monster tear us apart. Wicked animal.\n\nHere, take the idol. I don't want it near me."

"3952276-0-3961";"Good. It's not inside you. Now, listen. There's some horror making copies of people. When it kills you, it ""twins"" you: it makes a copy of your body for its own.\n\nHowever, it's not a perfect copy. It can't mimic speech."
"3952276-0-3962";"I'm watching the pirates and letting my anger rise like the ocean at high tide!\n\nThe Khajiit must pay for their attack on our village, but my courage hasn't yet reached the level of my anger. I demand vengeance!"
"3952276-0-3965";"Cause a distraction, something that will slow them down and give you enough time to find our missing people.\n\nEveryone's on edge because of the Llodos plague. We can use that. You know what people think causes the plague? Rats."
"3952276-0-3969";"Here's another tip, free of charge. Keep your weapon handy. I've never seen the kwama this aggressive. \n\nIt's such a waste, isn't it?"
"3952276-0-3970";"Speak to <<1>>, the smith. He has a plan to distract the guards. This will give us enough time to get in and grab the weapons.\n\nDo what he tells you."
"3952276-0-3971";"I need to seal the city. No one gets in or out. I won't let any more of our people vanish.\n\nWill you perform one more task for us? To facilitate your mission, the guards have been informed that you may come and go as you please."
"3952276-0-3972";"I care only about a name and a location. Such information brings me closer to fulfilling my current contract.\n\nBecause of this, I've decided to offer some assistance."
"3952276-0-3973";"<This construct is battle-worn and slick with oil and fresh blood. Its metal frame has been crushed and battered.>\n\n<A trail of broken and overturned wagons extends to the northeast.>"
"3952276-0-3974";"Aye! The milk drinkers landed to the west at that big yellow tree thing. Now the Dres have got their skirts in a twist. ""Oh, please save us, big strong Nords!""\n\nFancy lads, the lot of them. They think Nords only exist to save Elven arses."
"3952276-0-3975";"What a mess! We were attacked on the way to Narsis.\n\nDres raiders, with Dwarven machines, came out of nowhere! They took our cargo crates and one of the Dres leaders even took the manifest, as if he could use it."
"3952276-0-3978";"No matter how often I punish them, some of these soldiers must adhere to rules and regulations. Where's the fun in that, I ask you?\n\nSince you're here, I think we have a Nord spy in the fort. Expose this spy and I'll make you a captain."
"3952276-0-3979";"You should immediately report to General Gavryn Redoran at Tal'Deic Keep, on the far side of the compound. \n\nA word of advice? The General has been somewhat … erratic lately. Don't ask him too many questions."
"3952276-0-3980";"I am a disciple of the Tribunal. My people come to me for comfort, yet I have none to give. The Three are silent. I lift my voice, but they do not answer. \n\nThe Covenant circles Ebonheart, and I cannot even pray for wisdom."
"3952276-0-3984";"You've done well here. We could use more like you.\n\nIn fact, we could use more like you at Fort Virak. The Daggerfall Covenant has seized it."
"3952276-0-3985";"Ah. Worry not, nothing too dangerous for one such as you. No, it is merely a game with a hint of danger, but a promise of great reward. You merely need to convince three, ah… friends to give you what I require."
"3952276-0-3986";"The Maulborn have overrun the traders' camp and occupied the pass. By the authority of House Hlaalu, this area is closed. It's a death trap."
"3952276-0-3987";"For the crime of believing pirates cared about the welfare of the Pact.\n\nRumors say the Dominion is smuggling in supplies through this miserable landing. My questions were not welcome. The so-called leader had me seized and put out here to rot."
"3952276-0-3988";"Yes, maybe. He works for the vicecanons. Another Dark Elf sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.\n\nIt's a good nose. I could use it to make a fine necklace."
"3952276-0-3989";"The soldier in question, <<1>>, announced himself and his intentions to undertake the Trials of the Burnished Scales.\n\nBy holy tradition, pilgrims who declare themselves may not be harmed. The Hist alone decides his worthiness through the trials."

"3952276-0-3991";"Three simple stone pieces, part of our heritage. No jewels, no gold, nothing a dryskin could value. Theft isn't unknown in Hissmir, but it's rare enough I wouldn't know where to start looking for the culprit."

"3952276-0-3995";"We need to find out more about the General's retainer, this Durel Gilveni. Why did the General send him into the ruins? And who are those others the note refers to?"
"3952276-0-3996";"Ssssh! Not so loud. You're going to get me in trouble. The Sentinels have sent more than a few soldiers to the healers for less.\n\nBesides, you're a stranger here. You shouldn't get involved."
"3952276-0-3997";"You don't know? Then you can't be with the Worm Cult.\n\nThose foul necromancers raided our village last night. We trapped three of their lieutenants in our huts, but they're quite dangerous. We're at an impasse."
"3952276-0-3998";"In a word … murder. You've arrived at a delicate time. Pray you don't bring more troubles to our doorstep.\n\nThe vicecanons would know of any newcomers."

"3952276-0-4003";"<<1>>, a Daedric ruin southeast of here. It's big enough to harbor a substantial enemy force and close enough to trouble Stormhold. Besides, my scouts report signs of activity within.\n\nI'll take a regiment to <<1>>. Don't want to take any chances."
"3952276-0-4005";"A Covenant force lead by a mage named Alexandra Conele has invaded Vivec's Antlers. They're after a powerful artifact called the Coral Heart.\n\nWe tried to take Vivec's Antlers back, but her army almost wiped us out."
"3952276-0-4009";"I'm entertaining important people. We have no time for uninvited guests."
"3952276-0-4010";"The tomb is buried in the mountainside. There's a tunnel that will take you right to its entrance.\n\nYou can find the tunnel by leaving Kragenmoor through the western pass."
"3952276-0-4011";"By Vivec, you're the only one who cared. \n\nHere, take my herding rod. Use it to poke my loose guar in the ribs. They'll recognize the feeling and know they should return home. Then check back with me!"
"3952276-0-4012";"Father's given you the key then. Excellent! I'll make a mark on your map. You should find a cave there that leads to the path up the slope."
"3952276-0-4013";"Me? I won't do anything. However, someone else could deliver a good lesson.\n\nThe docks crawl with foreign ""merchants"" tempting the local crews with their sweet High Elf gold. A little bloodshed will send them a message."
"3952276-0-4014";"Renegades from my tribe are besieging the Tribunal Temple at Iliath.\n\nOur wise woman needs help persuading our Ashkhan this is a terrible mistake."
"3952276-0-4015";"Get on their ship, take their things, and escape alive. It's a simple plan.\n\nThe Dominion's landing is right outside. I'll have a boat to haul the treasure. We can't go back the way we came."
"3952276-0-4018";"I'm Saryvn, a soldier from the fort. I, er, might have crept down to the river to enjoy a quiet drink away from my superiors. \n\nDon't look at me like that. Anyway, these stupid cultists grabbed me. Next thing I knew, I was locked in here."
"3952276-0-4019";"Raiders. The dark-skinned ones attack, hoping to take our mine and make us slaves once more.\n\nThey even summoned a Daedra. That was a mistake. The Daedra took everyone away, Argonian and raider, and only left their soul crystals behind."
"3952276-0-4021";"The Vereansu—heathen Ashlanders—attacked Muth Gnaar! This is a place of healing and refuge. We're a simple order, using the <<1>> to help those afflicted by the Llodos plague.\n\nThey killed monks and afflicted alike without mercy."
"3952276-0-4022";"Arcane wardstones that make the Maulborn immune to the plague—a gift from someone called Vox.\n\nSure would be a shame if those alits came down with their own plague. How about you smash those wards that're protecting them?"
"3952276-0-4026";"Tanval Indoril entered town at the head of his personal Vanguard and demanded an audience with the grandmaster. \n\nNow the Vanguard patrols the streets. They command in Kragenmoor."

"3952276-0-4030";"Whether <<1>> continues or ends. Preserve the <<z:2>> and we remain as we are, in this state between life and death. Destroy it and you end the curse, allowing us a final rest."
"3952276-0-4032";"You have to help me! These necromancers will force my soul into their … ""animus geodes,"" I think they called them. They already killed my guards and siphoned their spirits inside those horrible purple stones!"
"3952276-0-4035";"I'm the wise woman of the Kagesh tribe of Ashlanders. My tribe is divided because our Ashkhan, the man who should be guiding us wisely, is a fool.\n\nHe's decided to attack the Tribunal Temple to the south. It's a fatal mistake."
"3952276-0-4036";"I couldn't just leave the wasps! I made a mixture that fooled them into thinking we're part of their hive. I thought they'd be wonderful guard creatures but—not so much.\n\nBut I've got a new formula that should turn them into an angry army."
"3952276-0-4039";"While my people still lived, we sealed the temple with a magic ward to keep angry spirits and undead from following us out.\n\nSay ""betrux"" to the temple door to unseal it."
"3952276-0-4040";"""It is believed this relic can awaken ancient Ayleid 'Alasil pilasters,' but I've yet to determine how precisely it works. Perhaps Neeja-Meen will know more. I should ask the next time she travels through Hissmir.""\n\n""—Scholar Kizibael"""
"3952276-0-4042";"Not as much as I'd like. But I think the constructs received their orders from the rod through those resonators. \n\nThe spheres cannibalize dead spiders for parts. What if we interfered with that process?"
"3952276-0-4043";"I know that. But Dolril isn't the only one who won't abandon the afflicted.\n\nI can't just leave. Someone has to collect the medallions of the fallen."
"3952276-0-4045";"The disciple of our Tribunal Temple has lost his faith. He says the Three no longer speak to him. \n\nHe sent me to pray for him at shrines to Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil just outside town. But I was driven away by a foul smell and angry alit."
"3952276-0-4046";"<<1>> … we were egg-cousins when we were young. He fell in love and went to the <<2>> to follow her. All the while, he was blind to my affections.\n\nAt first, he sent letters back. Then none came. I even wrote to his lover to ask what became of him."
"3952276-0-4050";"Wisps or no wisps, it's wrong to leave a body unable to return to the Hist. And the travelers who bring the bodies, well, they expect a burial.\n\nI've tried, but I can't fight wisps with a shovel. All I can do is bury the dead."
"3952276-0-4051";"The Aldmeri Dominion happened. They landed their ships at our village southeast of Hissmir. Then they started slaughtering everyone.\n\nThey may be coming this way next."
"3952276-0-4053";"Be still! Their patrols are everywhere.\n\n<<1>> leads <<2>>. She'll tell you more than you want to know about the necromancers plaguing our home. And keep your head down, will you?"
"3952276-0-4055";"<<1>>, from <<2>>. I'm watching for Worm Cultists. Downed four of them today, but they keep harassing our village.\n\nIf necromancers don't scare you away, <<3>> could make use of you. She's in the middle of our village."
"3952276-0-4056";"They've harassed <<1>> for days. I don't know why, but <<2>> should. Her wisdom saw us through the rough times."
"3952276-0-4057";"<<1>> seemed harmless. At first, he studied our ways. Then he began taking tokens and other discards from our rituals. That was odd, but did no harm.\n\nThen he was caught digging up some of our graves. He said he simply wished to examine them."
"3952276-0-4059";"The atronachs? Well … that's bad. I banished them when I cast Father's spell.\n\nWe were sure we could control the creature. Damn it. I suppose we'll have to summon them again, somehow."
"3952276-0-4060";"You are wise to ask. Yes. I have brought you a focus, a totem, that should help you in the trial ahead. It is a storm totem that will bring pure waters down on his blistering skin."
"3952276-0-4061";"By the soul of Ysgramor! That's what I like to hear. It's the damned Scamps! Without the lads in the way, they'd overrun us all.\n\nScouts tracked them back to caves on the mountainside."
"3952276-0-4062";"Balreth is bound, but the Covenant still threatens the Ashlands. We've received word that a major offensive has washed up on shore to the west of Ebonheart. Pact and Covenant troops now fight to hold the land coral maze that is Vivec's Antlers."
"3952276-0-4063";"I don't know where else to look. Poor Valrendil. I fear the wispmother will use him. She'll force him to protect her, even though violence is against his nature.\n\nYou must be kind to him, and she must be stopped."
"3952276-0-4068";"Supernal Dreamers stole it from me and shattered itinto five pieces. They're going to use them in some ungodly ritual. I need them back; they're very powerful."
"3952276-0-4069";"The problem is that my foolish son gambled away a rather valuable crystal. He was tricked by these blasted Supernal Dreamers."
"3952276-0-4070";"Not nearly enough, my good man! Not nearly enough. You see, these dastardly dreamers have taken something very precious from me.  I have sent several excursions out into their camp to no avail."
"3952276-0-4071";"These Supernal Dreamers have stolen and shattered my Crystal of Power.  Fortunately, I think my wizard can repair the crystal if I give him all the shards."
"3952276-0-4072";"They want to use my Crystal of Power to fuel some terrible ritual. In preparation, they've shattered the crystal into five parts. I need someone to kill Supernal Dreamers and recover those five shards!"
"3952276-0-4073";"Lady Almalexia sent her Ordinators to hold this position, but we are too few to go up against Vox's bolstered forces."
"3952276-0-4079";"You should immediately report to General Gavryn Redoran at Tal'Deic Keep. \n\nA word of advice? The General has been somewhat … erratic lately. Don't ask him too many questions."
"3952276-0-4082";"I should think it's obvious.  Or did you miss the Supernal Dreamers all over the place?  They cheat at cards and they threw me in here."
"3952276-0-4083";"My name is Jonathan. I am the son of Lord Strictal."
"3952276-0-4086";"The Supernal Dreamers took me as ransom when they stole my father's crystal. Please save me from my bondage!."
"3952276-0-4087";"Please Save me"
"3952276-0-4088";"I was attempting to get my father's shards back when I was taken prisoner. Please you have to help me!"
"3952276-0-4090";"I'm Andrei Stictal, son of Lord Geoffroi. The Supernal Dreamers captured me. You have to help me!"
"3952276-0-4092";"Yes, she was seen recently.\n\nPash-Riha is like a storm: unpredictable and violent. I fear one day she will break."
"3952276-0-4094";"We're not done just yet! Theres a boss mob that needs killing."
"3952276-0-4097";"I won't feel safe until these cultists are dealth with.  And they won't leave as long as their Dreadlord is here?"
"3952276-0-4112";"YES YOU WOULD. QUEST GO NOW!"
"3952276-0-4113";"I'll survive. Worse fates await in this ruin.\n\nBattlemage Gaston sent the lot of us down here to get the missing pieces of a stone he found. Seems the Goblins are using them as totems. I managed to take one, but my people are still down there."
"3952276-0-4114";"I'm with the Lion Guard—we were responding to reports of a Goblin infestation.\n\nFind them we did, but a fiend ambushed us as we attacked. Daedric, I think, forcing us to retreat to the entrance of the ruin. And now the Goblins have hemmed us in."
"3952276-0-4116";"Who … who are you? Thank the gods! You would not believe what I've seen here!\n\nNo, perhaps you would. Please, I need your help. We've got to save them!"
"3952276-0-4123";"We seek to right an injustice. But we can't do it alone.\n\nUntil the Pact set us free, we were the property of the Volek family. Now the last of the Voleks has come to Mournhold."
"3952276-0-4124";"I heard sounds of battle, and a voice shouting for someone named <<1>> to run. The Worm Cult likely attacked some unlucky travelers.\n\nMy advice? Find this <<1>> before the Worm Cult adds him to their collection of undead slaves."
"3952276-0-4126";"You are correct. The Dark Elves of Kragenmoor do not swim in the River of Humor. \n\nI came here to delve into a nearby tomb, but the soldiers prevent my entry."
"3952276-0-4127";"Yes. The Vanguard made the error of taking advantage of my noble house. I want that error corrected."
"3952276-0-4129";"I'm one of the vicecanon's scouts. I've been watching Dominion activity in <<1>> for days.\n\n<<1>> has been abandoned for years, the only one who lives there now is a crazy Kothringi. The Dominion tied him up in the center of the village."
"3952276-0-4130";"What business is it of yours, outsider?\n\nForgive me. That's the pain speaking. My friends and I were scavenging in the swamp as we always do, but the creatures there suddenly went mad and attacked us. I barely got out alive."
"3952276-0-4131";"Who would respond? The Pact holds the Covenant at bay. The only troops they've sent are their wounded and dying.\n\nYou've helped the grievously injured, but wounded soldiers can't protect us."
"3952276-0-4132";"Did what I was taught to do. When outnumbered, I hide. Not the bravest move, but it kept the two of us alive.\n\nListen, if you're going down there, I could use your help. I need some things from the camp."
"3952276-0-4133";"He took some troops to the southern side of the Gorge. He's looking for the Maulborn leader. The alchemist.\n\nI don't know if he made it that far or not."
"3952276-0-4138";"Take word of what we've accomplished to <<1>> in Hissmir. They already know the situation here at Murkwater, but they should know more.\n\nIt's not far from here, just to the northwest."

"3952276-0-4148";"Oh, yes. It's the most excitement we've seen in years."
"3952276-0-4149";"I was trying to figure out how to sneak past all these Ashlanders so I could burn their supplies. They killed our father, and me and my brothers vowed revenge.\n\nIt's just a foolish dream. I'm about as stealthy as a herd of guar."
"3952276-0-4150";"My brothers and I made a pact to burn the Vereansu supplies. They killed our father when they attacked Muth Gnaar. \n\nI tried to imagine which crates I would burn, but don't think I can do it. I'm not the violent type."
"3952276-0-4152";"Help? It's too late for that. We were caring for the afflicted when the Vereansu attacked us without warning. They killed everyone in the Muth Gnaar monastery and set everything on fire. They threw people into the flames!"
"3952276-0-4153";"<<1>> is a simple fishing village, but the Ayleid once called it home. Ancient artifacts and dark secrets hide beneath the swamp.\n\nAgents went in to uncover the Dominion's purpose. <<2>>, <<3>>, and <<4>>. They haven't returned."
"3952276-0-4154";"Must remember, talk slower and louder. Let me start over.\n\nI am Rigurt! We're brand-new diplomats, here to learn about Dark Elf way of life and spread word about our glorious Nord culture. Such knowledging will strengthen our alliance!"
"3952276-0-4155";"Bold words, but your Divines can't protect you here. \n\nYour goddess hides in her Temple while Vox wields the power of Oblivion. How do you hope to stand against that?"
"3952276-0-4162";"Yeah, well … the fools got themselves carried off into the dungeon. Then our guide ran away.\n\nWe were hired to find out why the springs down there are making people sick, but they didn't say anything about lamias!"
"3952276-0-4163";"The Sacred Lady doesn't share all her secrets with those who serve her. But as far as I know, no attack has yet occurred within the confines of the city."
"3952276-0-4166";"So many people died! But they remain here, as angry and vengeful spirits."
"3952276-0-4167";"There's an injured woman on the road to Selfora. Find her and get her to safety."
"3952276-0-4169";"My clutch-brothers and I came seeking our brother, but we're too late. Filth-ridden Goblins have taken over the <<1>> mine. If <<2>> is still alive, the Goblins are between us and him.\n\nWe're not warriors, but you could save him."
"3952276-0-4171";"He's already inside. After he disabled the ward, Walks-in-Ash managed to get some troops inside. The ward came back up almost immediately afterward. \n\nDamn that old Dark Elf's hide!"
"3952276-0-4173";"While I was hunting, the Dominion killed my family and friends. These warm-bloods must die! They've turned this place into a forsaken hamlet!\n\nI can pick off their scouts, but their leader, who deserves death most of all, is too strong for me."
"3952276-0-4174";"The swamp. My friends and I were scavenging as we always do when the hoarvors and stranglers went mad.\n\nThere are dangers in the swamp, yes, but we've been dealing with them since we were hatchlings. Something is wrong."
"3952276-0-4175";"The swamp! My friends and I were scavenging as we always do when the rot-gorgers and stranglers went mad. There were dangers in the swamp, yes, but we've been dealing with them since we were hatchlings.\n\nSomething is wrong."
"3952276-0-4177";"I want to see a fair fight, but that can't happen here. Judgment keeps your silly gods at bay.\n\nThere's only one sure course. You must die by the hammer Vox wields. Once you enter her realm, you can collapse it from within."
"3952276-0-4179";"Take word of what we've accomplished to <<1>> in Hissmir. They know the situation here at Murkwater, so they should be informed.\n\nIt's not far from here, just to the northwest."
"3952276-0-4180";"The mages who first imprisoned Sadal linger here. The portal to Sadal's realm will not open without their aid.\n\nI believe they are angry with me."
"3952276-0-4187";"Reports tell me that a group of villagers have decided to take matters into their own hands. I don't condone their actions, but they might have information.\n\nFind the Argonian called Slips-Through-Fingers. She can lead you to them."
"3952276-0-4189";"<Beneath the corpse lies a bundle of notes.>\n\n""Day Seven: Damned dark in that cave. Under the sun, I can see the construct shows signs of dormancy rather than total failure."""
"3952276-0-4192";"Saervild Steel-Wind, deputy to the Vicecanon Hrondar. My son and I were sent to this festering sewer on a mission of vital importance to the Pact."
"3952276-0-4194";"The vicecanons tracked one of the long-lost keystones to <<1>>. If we can recover it, this artifact would be a major boon to our war efforts. \n\nUnfortunately, the prisoners don't trust the vicecanons, which means they don't trust me."
"3952276-0-4195";"And you agreed? He may not have mentioned the danger.\n\nThe keystone is in the prison dungeon. I don't know exactly where. And I should warn you: the dungeon is crawling with cannibals."
"3952276-0-4196";"The Imperials brought my family here after they killed my husband. My children, Nuzal and Zarukhari, are somewhere in the dungeons. \n\nI need them with me before I can pass on."
"3952276-0-4198";"More than a story. My mother <<1>> was one of the last to enter the <<2>> before the Imperials fled. She died there.\n\nSince the prisoners took over, I can't approach the place. Now spirits remain separate from the Hist. That is the greater sadness."
"3952276-0-4199";"Name's Damrina. I'm a Covenant scout. I saw the Imperial tents on my patrol, and came to investigate. Ended up getting captured.\n\nRight. Because that wasn't obvious."

"3952276-0-4207";"He thinks he's a magical genius. To prove a point, he's transformed his brother into a Goblin … a lady Goblin.\n\nThe chieftain of the nearby Shadowsilk tribe has taken him prisoner. He has every intent of taking Dithis as his tribal matron."
"3952276-0-4208";"The ritual Father gave me to rebind Balreth isn't working. Something's gone wrong. Daedra are pouring from the volcano, and I'm worried about the nearby towns. We need answers, and we need them fast."
"3952276-0-4209";"The guild has accepted an unusual contract. We've agreed to eradicate Daedric Anchors when they drop from the sky. Wherever they appear, Molag Bal's minions soon follow."
"3952276-0-4211";"Yes. We called in several favors to do it, but we've cracked her code.\n\nIn service to her dark master, <<1>> was after something hidden in a Dwarven ruin. A place known as <<2>>."
"3952276-0-4214";"You may have heard Stonefalls is under attack. This makes some things very lucrative. \n\nTake wine. If I had a particular bottle, there's a party who'd pay well for it."
"3952276-0-4216";"I need you to click a chest and a rock."
"3952276-0-4218";"Stonefalls is under attack, and some of the finer things in life are suddenly precious. Certain goods can be very lucrative when paired with the right buyer. \n\nTake wine, for instance."
"3952276-0-4219";"It's not important. My sister Kireth went into that Dwemer ruin, but she forgot to take my new control rod. I built it to deal with the spider constructs that infest the place.\n\nShe may not believe me, but she needs that rod."
"3952276-0-4224";"A nix-hound attacked our caravan. He savaged my leg and carried off one of our guar."
"3952276-0-4228";"Tanval Indoril entered town at the head of his personal Vanguard and demanded an audience with the grandmaster. \n\nNow the Vanguard patrols the streets. They command in Kragenmoor."
"3952276-0-4229";"What brings a hero of the Pact to Kragenmoor? \n\nOn most days, I'd be honored to welcome you to my city. Today, however, important matters distract me."
"3952276-0-4230";"We're here because of me. So many have died. I've shamed myself and my house. \n\nThere's no guarantee we'll survive what comes next. Whether we do or not, you must promise me something."
"3952276-0-4234";"I was. Now I am but a remnant of my former glory. \n\nMagistrix Vox shattered my reliquary and reduced me to this diminished form. You need my blessing to defeat her, but I cannot bestow it in my current state."
"3952276-0-4238";"This is Deepcrag Den, a kwama mine. But something's gone wrong.\n\nSome kind of fumes have filled the mine, and the kwama are going crazy. They're attacking the workers. I've been making potions to counter the fumes, but I'm running out of ingredients."
"3952276-0-4239";"Take this quest to test conversations"

"3952276-0-4247";"Vox has scores of fanatics in the ruins, yet only a handful of Ordinators stand against them. At any moment, they could overwhelm us with a single advance. \n\nWe just don't have the numbers to hold them off."
"3952276-0-4249";"The Dominion happened. They invaded my village and slew my people. Even worse, they destroyed the Hist Tree, trapping my fellow Argonians in a nightmare between life and death. Unable to rest, they have begun fighting each other, endlessly tormented."
"3952276-0-4252";"The visions, my friend. The Ayleids fled from the forces of Molag Bal and hid away the remains of a powerful relic. Merric has taken the crystal and the tome to an ancient forge. There he's begun the work of crafting the weapon anew."
"3952276-0-4253";"<This fetish carved from obsidian depicts an exaggerated female figure. The figure is marred by jagged slashes. The edges are sharp enough to draw blood.>\n\n<It's unclear if the gashes are intentional or the product of poor craftsmanship.>"
"3952276-0-4255";"The Renrijra are ""stab first, talk later"" types. You're something else.\n\nWhat a pity. If you were a pirate, you'd know how to get what <<1>> and I came here for."
"3952276-0-4256";"Take the Hist key to <<1>> at the entrance to the ruins. He's there now, trying to open the door, but he can't do it without the Hist key.\n\nBut that's probably a good thing."
"3952276-0-4257";"The pirates must have gotten into the ruins. This door to the xanmeer isn't sealed.\n\nI'll wager the commotion I heard from the pirates' ship involves the missing Fang."
"3952276-0-4259";"Ah, you're not one of them. The Renrijra pirates are camped right on top of an Argonian ruin my partner and I came here to study.\n\nLooks like they're excavating. Probably finding treasure … lots of treasure."
"3952276-0-4267";"What do you mean, what do I mean? Your invitation to attend Shad Astula, of course.\n\nOh, my—you really have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
"3952276-0-4270";"I pray to the Golden Eye: He Who Records All Knowledge, Keeper of the Oghma Infinium. \n\nWe've been attacked by servants of the Prince of Destruction. The Eye answered my prayer. He sent you."
"3952276-0-4271";"There are two people still trapped in the town, a young man and a woman. But the magical fire closes in on them."
"3952276-0-4273";"This is the council of province generals. They run the guild under the direction of the Guildmaster. And they're very concerned. I've been speaking to them about our experiences with the ghost of Jofnir and the attack on the Earth Forge."
"3952276-0-4276";"The Dominion invaded. They trapped my husband, <<1>>, along with the other villagers.\n\nI hid and got out past the guards, but I won't leave without my husband!"
"3952276-0-4279";"My father, Rulantaril, is missing. He disappeared from his workshop in Davon's Watch. \n\nI think his disappearance has some connection to this place. I want to know what, and then find him if I can."
"3952276-0-4280";"Three students arrived with you. The Dunmeri Lena and Tedras, and the Nord Hadmar.\n\nIt is your solemn duty to make sure they pass their initiation tests."
"3952276-0-4281";"Almost everything: herbs, poultices, bandages. We weren't prepared for this."
"3952276-0-4282";"Her hut's just up this path.\n\nShe doesn't trust me, and after our recent clash, I doubt she'll want me to stay. But I'll do whatever she says it takes to heal <<1>>."
"3952276-0-4284";"Darkness may dwell in your soul, and we want to see you prove it. Armando is a failed wine merchant in Davon's Watch. He has no family or friends. This is the writ for his death. Meet <<1>> at the Tavern near his cart. Don't fail."
"3952276-0-4285";"Alas, I've seen nothing beyond the chaos-bringer's name! Something interferes with my fore-vision, blocking my efforts at every turn.\n\nI suspect we are opposed by mighty forces beyond mortal ken."
"3952276-0-4290";"There's a bottle of <<1>> here in Ebonheart. The war wizard who owns it retired to this town and opened an inn.\n\n<<2>> took the bottle off the battlefield. Now it's gathering dust in her private reserve."
"3952276-0-4292";"Saint Veloth said someone would come to aid us.\n\nMagistrix Vox opened Daedric portals within these holy grounds. They're like wounds in the world. Now all sorts of vile creatures pour through and attack us."
"3952276-0-4295";"My son, Wideem-Voh. The accursed Dominion dryskins dragged several young ones out of the village. A few came back, but not my son.\n\nYou helped our village. Please, can you look for him? The Dominion must've set up camps nearby."
"3952276-0-4296";"Saint Veloth promised help was on its way. You must be the one he spoke of.\n\nDaedra have overrun the shrine and the saint's spirit fades. It's a disaster."
"3952276-0-4297";"You have entered the domain of the Blackfeather Court.\n\nYou must pay the toll. Flesh or silver? Choose!"
"3952276-0-4298";"New members are the lifeblood of the Mages Guild. Especially for retrieval missions. \n\nI've received word about a possible store of ancient knowledge in a ruin nearby. I'd like you to retrieve it for me."
"3952276-0-4299";"I did. I'm going to join the guild in Ebonheart. Their scales will be moist with envy when I show them my concoction. It's a potion that imitates the visions we get when we lick the Hist tree.\n\nI just need the final reagent."
"3952276-0-4302";"Sheogorath! He's made this process insufferable. I translated the last book you retrieved, but it doesn't make any sense.\n\nI can't find anything that might lead us to the next trial. I must be missing something."
"3952276-0-4303";"That's the attitude! The town's under constant threat and a horde of Reachmen took over the mine and sealed themselves inside."
"3952276-0-4304";"I don't know what they're looking for, but the bastards are all over the mine. They've slaughtered most of my miners. I think a few are still alive, held captive. Find them and free them, if you can!"
"3952276-0-4305";"They're saving me for something, something horrible. You have to get me out of these vines!"
"3952276-0-4307";"The Worm Cult happened. Killed my father and some of the farm hands before we could stop them. The screams riled up the giants that live nearby. Kyne protect us!"
"3952276-0-4308";"What? Who … who are you? The last thing I remember, I was performing. I'd just reached the crescendo, and then the sky … Shor's bones, the sky!"
"3952276-0-4309";"<This book about Vaermina glows with an inner light. Some kind of reaction to the intruding Daedric realm.>"
"3952276-0-4311";"The Giant attacked the city. Sinmur. Dark energy surrounded him. He had an evil cunning in his eyes. Punted steer and men aside like toys. Funny, until they hit something."
"3952276-0-4313";"<A number of Nord runes are carved on one side of the stone, with the name ""Hodmar Iron-Kettle"" on the other. Hodmar may be related to  <<1>>.>"
"3952276-0-4314";"Hours ago. We tracked Stral, the bastard, to Vernim Wood. The Reachmen, though, they're not … it's not what we thought. \n\nThe Worm Cult. They're here."
"3952276-0-4315";"Get me out! Get me out of these things!"
"3952276-0-4316";"Just held me with these vines, so far. Get them off me and I'll join the defense, if I can reach the surface."
"3952276-0-4317";"Please, don't let them kill me too!"
"3952276-0-4318";"Because those Supernal Dreamers have stolen a Crystal of Power, and shattered it!"
"3952276-0-4320";"Those darn dreamers, they stole my antique crystal! Split it up and is usin' the pieces to summon fire lizards or somethin'."
"3952276-0-4321";"The Supernal Dreamers have stolen my Crystal of Power. They plan to use the crystal to fuel Daedric summoning rituals. Do you think you can get the all the shards back?"
"3952276-0-4322";"Supernal Dreamers stole one of my Crystals of Power. They plan to use it to fuel Daedric summoning rituals. To that end, they shattered the crystal into five pieces."
"3952276-0-4323";"Supernal Dreamers have stolen my Crystal of Power to fuel their terrible rituals."
"3952276-0-4326";"Ssk! The Reachmen assaulted the town and hold the mine. They hide behind this magical shield. We must bring it down, for the Pact and glory."
"3952276-0-4327";"Those Supernal Dreamers captured me. Who knows what they might do to me?"
"3952276-0-4328";"Thank you! I'd be done for without your help. You know, this reminds me of-"
"3952276-0-4329";"I was captued by the Supernal Dreamers to be used as a sacrifie to futher their plans to control the world."
"3952276-0-4332";"Hey, this is your quest. Get me out of here."
"3952276-0-4333";"Good catch, sport, you got me. Look, just be a pal and let me go."
"3952276-0-4334";"I've been captured by the Dreamers, but they've said nothing about a ransom."
"3952276-0-4335";"It's that cursed Khajit curse. Life tip: No matter how comfy they are, don't make kitten skin boots."
"3952276-0-4336";"Just cut me free and I will be able to make it out on my own."
"3952276-0-4338";"Yes. Poke the widget to make him appear, then kill him dead!"
"3952276-0-4339";"You must kill the Beast."
"3952276-0-4340";"Could you murder the leader of the supernals for me?"
"3952276-0-4341";"Well, you could end the life of Remelie Frinck. She's the Fire Mage that leads the Supernal Dreamers.\n\nIf her influence is ended, the Supernal Dreamers will flee back to Stormhaven."
"3952276-0-4342";"The Supernal Dreamers have set up camp nearby and have been a thorn in my side. I need someone to deal with them."
"3952276-0-4343";"Dang these super-whatnals! There's a boss who's controlling them."
"3952276-0-4344";"Even without the shards the leader of this foul group might still find a way to summon that Daedra."
"3952276-0-4345";"Based on information received, it has come to my attention that the bongo thief was none other than my brother, Cloggg."
"3952276-0-4346";"Not unless you've spent your life poring over obscure Daedric tomes. The Chateau is in the darkest part of Dementia, the shadow land of the Shivering Isles. I'm worried that …."
"3952276-0-4349";"Yes. I had Naryu investigate the evidence you retrieved from the Maulborn camp. She discovered something she wants to share. Find her back in town."
"3952276-0-4350";"On to our next assignment! We don't get a lot of down time. We're always on the job, always watching.\n\nAre you heading to Mournhold now?"
"3952276-0-4351";"Belron left the camp. He muttered something about further research. Head into the field and find that Dark Elf. Lend him whatever aid you can."
"3952276-0-4352";"Name's Bragur. I tend the books and the artifacts here. A thousand stories in every one. You're up and around. Ask your help? Pint of mead in it for you! If I ever go drinking again."
"3952276-0-4353";"Narsis sent me to investigate Quarantine Serk. Now that I know a mad cult is poisoning our people, I'm even more concerned.\n\nThe Maulborn are a menace."
"3952276-0-4354";"Name's Bragur. I tend the books and the artifacts here. Ask your help? I've so much to do, now I'm back on my feet. Pint of mead in it for you!"
"3952276-0-4355";"Sinmur. The giant led the Reachmen from Shor's Stone. I arrived just in time to see the Watch Captain throw herself into the fray. I need to restore order here. Can I press you into service once again?"
"3952276-0-4357";"I'm … I'm beyond help. I heard you talking to the commander. The Reach … all of this for nothing. Please. Make my death worth something."
"3952276-0-4359";"The Reachmen. They've descended on Boulderfall Pass. Our troops barely hold the line."
"3952276-0-4360";"Look, look down the road! My house is on fire, and Daedra roam free!\n\nI don't know where my family is. They may be trapped by the fires, or killed by those savage beasts!"
"3952276-0-4362";"The name's Paldeen. A band of Khajiit kidnapped me. They're forcing me to decipher the Yokudan runes on the relics they're looting. Damned grave robbers.\n\nThing is, I think I've discovered something valuable down here. More so than wealth."
"3952276-0-4364";"<This sword is very old, possibly Ayleid in origin. Its time-worn blade is missing fragments, rendering it useless as a weapon. With a little effort you could remove it from the stone.>"
"3952276-0-4365";"As Vox fled Mournhold, she went east.\n\nWith the recent troubles the Ordinators are on high alert. One of them saw her headed that way."
"3952276-0-4366";"You may have noticed the ruin in the center of the wood. That shroud of death and darkness? Nothing living can pass through it. \n\nLuckily, the dead can."
"3952276-0-4373";"<<1>> would like to see you as soon as possible. She said the journal has revealed something about ""the Vivicus,"" whatever that is. She awaits you at the Guildhall."
"3952276-0-4375";"""Dearest Tavo,\n\n""Please try to return to Sentinel as quickly as you can. If the debt collector comes and we come up short, I fear what he might do. A dozen relics should more than cover our debt.\n\n""Yours forever,\nNahrina"""
"3952276-0-4378";"Aye. She's ready to summon the portal for you. I'll meet you in the Isles. Just … hurry if you please, adept. I'm worried."
"3952276-0-4379";"Aye, trolls take them. I blame myself. I took our finest warriors with me to Shor's Stone. The recruits left behind didn't have a chance.\n\nWe must retake the Hall!"
"3952276-0-4382";"The Reachmen are gathering in the Wood. Gjakil needs all able blades to head there right away!"
"3952276-0-4383";"Dominion soldiers brought us here for that alchemist's experiments. <<1>>, I heard them say. None of my students survived, and now the lamias took their corpses.\n\nA Shadowscale freed me and offered to recover the bodies, but she needs help."
"3952276-0-4384";"The Pact needs help. The vicecanons, more specifically. Vicecanon Hrondar, to be completely specific.\n\nActually, we need his gerent, Saervild. He's in charge of an expedition to recover Argonian relics from the Bogmother ruins."
"3952276-0-4385";"Do you know what this place is? Pinepeak Caverns? This is where one of Ysagramor's Companions was buried. Hakra was her name.\n\nWe came to ensure that her tomb was safe, but the Worms were already here. They ambushed us inside, and we barely escaped."
"3952276-0-4387";"Charadin. When the cultists attacked, everyone ran. Charadin and I were alone, lost in the caverns. They captured him, there was a ritual. Oh, what they did to him!\n\nI should have tried to rescue him. But I didn't, I just ran."
"3952276-0-4388";"Yes. We are in no shape to make the journey. If the Worm Cult is already there, then there is little we could do anyways.\n\nYou, however, could help there as you have here. Taarengrav is to the south. Please go. Valdur's spirit must be protected."
"3952276-0-4390";"Ulrich's our champion. He belonged to the Lion Guard before King Emeric swore them into his personal service.\n\nHe's strong as a giant. Brave as a bear. He led us to Silaseli when the Reachmen attacked our farms."
"3952276-0-4391";"I've been tracking the beast for weeks. I call him Deathclaw. \n\nI finally caught up to him, but it … well, it went badly."
"3952276-0-4392";"I … I can understand you! Oh, my! I'm not a skeever!"
"3952276-0-4393";"They're alert, looking for something. Had to kill the one behind me before he warned the others."
"3952276-0-4394";"I came out here with three of my Fighters Guild comrades. We heard rumors of dangerous creatures in the cave.\n\nThen we found spiders. Argonians are resistant to poison. That's the only reason I got away."
"3952276-0-4395";"A fisherman found you washed up on the beach. He brought you back to town.\n\nIt's a miracle you survived."
"3952276-0-4397";"The council has spoken. Sees-All-Colors never returned to the fold after your visit to Abagarlas. She has fled, she is guilty … she must be killed."
"3952276-0-4398";"You and I are going to lead the way through the tomb. The locals call it Last Rest. \n\nDarj and Seyne are going to bring up the rear. We'll make sure everyone keeps moving."
"3952276-0-4399";"The dead walk at Skyshroud. There's an evil power radiating from within the shrine, but the door's locked. \n\nIn the skalds' tales, every Dragon shrine had a priest. If we could speak with Skyshroud's priest, he could tell us how to get in."
"3952276-0-4400";"We're searching these caverns for a sacred shrine that's been lost for ages. Our problem is that dreugh and Goblins are overrunning the place. \n\nGoblins are slow-witted. If you kill their chieftain, they must accept you as their leader."
"3952276-0-4402";"Eiman is inside this cave … somewhere.\n\nThe Frozen Man does all sorts of things to people who enter his domain. I can't leave Eiman in there. Since Father died and Mother left, he's all I have."

"3952276-0-4405";"No, I'm … I'm just very tired. Thanks to Shalidor, we were able to decipher the deeper ritual hidden within the tomes as a set. \n\nHe's ready and waiting. Together, you'll perform the ritual that will … hah. Perform. Like a dancing midget!"
"3952276-0-4406";"No, I'm not. The last place I saw <<1>> was near our mill, just north of here.\n\nTake this whistle. Use it when you get over there. I'll wait here in case he comes home."
"3952276-0-4413";"They're alert, looking for something. Had to kill the one behind me before he warned the others."
"3952276-0-4415";"The Covenant is here. They've taken the signal fire, and we need to warn the mainland. \n\nI need you to carve a path through them and light it. The beacon stands atop the tower just outside town."
"3952276-0-4429";"Xuth! Our foolish clutch-brother, <<1>>, came to this village, even though he was warned not to.\n\nHe is trapped in the <<2>> mine. The little ones, the Goblins, have captured it. <<1>> is still inside."
"3952276-0-4430";"Save our idiot clutch-brother, <<1>>. He came to this dismal village to work in the <<2>> mine. Now Goblins have seized it, and our brother's inside.\n\nA group of us came to rescue him. What were we thinking? We're not warriors."
"3952276-0-4432";"If that necromancer was working for the Covenant, we're all in danger. I'll head back to the village to prepare our defenses.\n\nYou'll need to search the island for villagers and send them back to Bleakrock Village. Good luck!"
"3952276-0-4433";"Soldiers, here? That's ill news. I'll get my brother back to the village.\n\nIn the meantime, you need to find missing people. There are a lot of us scattered across the wilds. Find as many as you can."
"3952276-0-4434";"You found the evidence. The Covenant sent these bandits, and that means trouble. \n\nI'll head back and warn Captain Rana. You'll need to find as many missing people as possible."
"3952276-0-4435";"If only I had listened to Tillrani! I was a fool! We must evacuate, but people are scattered all over the island. \n\nPlease, seek them out. I'll rally them as they return. We'll get them ready to leave."
"3952276-0-4442";"Giants attacked our village. Many villagers died in Lower Yorgrim at the hands of these degenerate giants.\n\nI gathered the few survivors I could find and fled to this fishing camp."
"3952276-0-4446";"While we were away on business, we received word of the Imperial attack. When we got here, the houses were on fire!\n\nDamar went to look for survivors. I think he's looking for his fiancee, Milta."
"3952276-0-4447";"This Covenant is burning the fields and murdering us where we stand.\n\nPlease, there are others out in the paddies. Someone needs to find <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>."
"3952276-0-4448";"Go to the watchtower, just past the village of Dhalmora. \n\nTell the soldiers there to light the signal fires along the coast. The fires will warn Davon's Watch that war is upon them."
"3952276-0-4449";"There were scary noises in the fields. Some of my guar ran away. \n\nI'm worried, worried, worried about them, but I can't leave the guar who stayed behind. They're too frightened."
"3952276-0-4461";"I want you between the Covenant attackers and the refugees.\n\nThe Covenant is here. They'll strike at any moment."
"3952276-0-4466";"The shrine to the goddess Kyne. We come here to pray and ask for her blessing before battle.\n\nThe rest of our brigade went to visit the shrine yesterday. They haven't returned yet and I'm worried about them."
"3952276-0-4467";"You can't look for her now. \n\nFishermen from the docks are trapped in the windmill. Rescue them before they burn."
"3952276-0-4468";"Covenant raiders are burning the fields. They've trapped me in the tall grass.\n\nPlease, there are others out here. You have to find <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>!"
"3952276-0-4469";"Covenant scouts are setting fire to the fields, trapping us here to die.\n\nPlease, there are others with me out here. You've got to find <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>!"
"3952276-0-4470";"Covenant scouts are burning the fields. We were working the crops, and they started killing!\n\nPlease, there are others with me out here: <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>."
"3952276-0-4477";"Bal Foyen doesn't have much of a militia to defend it, but we do have netch.\n\nNetch bulls are usually docile, but when they think their herd is threatened, they're fearsome."
"3952276-0-4478";"This is Voljar's Meadery. Makes the sweetest mead you'll ever taste … at least, it did. Then the Orcthane sent his Stormfist thugs. He demanded free mead for his troops. \n\nTheir brute of a leader got carried away. He killed the Voljar family."
"3952276-0-4480";"I'm the tough one! I've taken down some of the Stormfist soldiers, but their leader Kazok still lives. He's the one that killed poor Inga. As long as he's alive, these bastards won't leave!\n\nSomeone needs to plant Kazok's head on a pike!"
"3952276-0-4483";"The Covenant attacked in force when they saw the signal fires. Even now, they're marching on Fort Zeren.\n\nDarj took some of the villagers there, including my men."
"3952276-0-4486";"I don't have a grand quest to offer you. We're just cold and hurt and afraid for our lives."
"3952276-0-4494";"Good. Cultists of the Shadowed Path have taken over Haynote Cave, north of here. Soon they'll start preying on us. If you'd kill some of their necromancers, that should slow them down."
"3952276-0-4501";"Head to Davon's Watch and report in. <<1>> should be on duty.\n\nClear skies and firm roads, my friend."
"3952276-0-4502";"Head to Davon's Watch and speak with <<1>>.\n\nMake sure they've been warned about the Covenant."
"3952276-0-4503";"Yes, a bad one. Nisin Cave has become a Shadowed Path den. Worse yet, they have a Dremora named Barasatii leading them. I've got a bad feeling about her. Think you could kill her for us?"
"3952276-0-4504";"We made a terrible mistake. We thought we were clearing out a simple spider infestation, but it's far worse.\n\nThe whispers … they never stop. It's maddening! We got out, but our commander, Guardian Sud-Hareem, is still in there."
"3952276-0-4506";"Giants attacked Lower Yorgrim. It's a disaster!"
"3952276-0-4507";"Droi was sent to the shrine ahead of the brigade, to let the Keepers know we were coming and give them time to prepare. \n\nWhen we arrived, we found Droi like this, burning with fever. I've been trying to care for him, but nothing seems to help."
"3952276-0-4508";"Strange lights and sounds have been coming from the shrine at the center of the grove. It's not normal. That's probably where you'll find the fallen Keeper.\n\nWhatever Ormi uses to channel these dark powers, it's corrupting the serenity of the grove."
"3952276-0-4509";"Thane Mera Stormcloak. She keeps the city running and oversees the Windhelm Guard. That makes her extremely busy. Especially now, what with the Konunleikar and the Ebonheart Pact delegates and all."
"3952276-0-4510";"The Konunleikar, the great games to honor the reign of King Jorunn, fills the city with good cheer. When a king survives to his tenth year on the throne, we celebrate.\n\nBut not everyone who has come to Windhelm is in a festive mood."
"3952276-0-4511";"While you were completing your mission, another competitor was injured. One of my best. The champion of Windhelm. \n\nThis just got personal. I have another task for you, if you're willing."
"3952276-0-4512";"Someone must have seen something during the race.\n\nThe assassins fled after their cowardly attack, but every rat has a hole to hide in. You must find that hole."
"3952276-0-4514";"Fildgor is King Jorunn's twin brother. When Queen Nurnhilde fell in battle, the brothers joined forces to defeat the Akaviri, but then they fought over the throne. Jorunn won the day and exiled his brother.\n\nNow Fildgor has returned."
"3952276-0-4517";"We're half of what's left of Fort Morvunskar's garrison. The other half is at Captain Hamar's camp on the other side of the fort. \n\nThey hit us hard from out of nowhere and forced us to abandon the fort."
"3952276-0-4518";"The Stormfists came out of nowhere and forced us to retreat from the fort. We escaped, as did Lieutenant Koruni and a few of her soldiers.\n\nI don't know what the Stormfists want, but we haven't seen that clan around here for almost a decade."
"3952276-0-4522";"You should have been here a few days ago. A skeleton lurched in and chased villagers around. Atugol bashed its head in with a hammer before it killed anyone, but it was a close call. It must have come from the graveyard to the southwest."
"3952276-0-4523";"I fear she's been eaten by nix-hounds. I'm terrified of them.\n\nShe made me a flute. Said it would calm them. To prove her point, she went up the trail behind me. A pack of beasts lives up there."
"3952276-0-4525";"A giant bear has been attacking travellers to the northeast. The locals call it ""Gaping Maw."" Even the wildlife around here is against us. Would you kill it, please?"
"3952276-0-4527";"Many have come here fleeing the war. They left their homes with only a few prized possessions. \n\nThey were preyed upon by bandits en route. Many lost their lives; the lucky ones only lost all their possessions."
"3952276-0-4528";"My father is still weak from the poison, but he's recovering. I'm organizing things while he gets his strength back.\n\nI need to regain the confidence of our Dark Elf and Argonian allies. My regrettable actions at Fort Amol have made them wary."
"3952276-0-4529";"I'm the sentry captain. To me, there's always a problem! It's in the details. That kind of thinking keeps us secure.\n\nCould you light the watchfires near the east and south gates? The fires keep the Stormfists from sneaking too close to the walls."
"3952276-0-4530";"He's inside, up at the keep. He's keeping the centurion sane with his sage advice.\n\nHead inside. And stay moist."
"3952276-0-4531";"He's inside, up at the keep. He's keeping the centurion sane with his wise advice.\n\nHead inside. And good luck"
"3952276-0-4532";"You can't look for her now. \n\nSome fishermen are trapped in the windmill. Free them before they burn."
"3952276-0-4534";"Goblins! The Rock Bone tribe has set up camp to the northeast. Only a matter of time before they attack. How about if you visit them first?"
"3952276-0-4535";"Just what I know. Skyrim's royal family and their honored servants are interred below. Well, the dead ones, anyway.\n\nThe fort was built to protect the crypts. There are precious relics, to be sure, but nothing to make these brigands risk so much."
"3952276-0-4536";"Prince Irnskar commanded me to keep watch. He wants to speak to you.\n\nHe's on the battlements at the east gate, watching the movements of Fildgor Orcthane's troops."
"3952276-0-4537";"Thieves. Damn them all to Oblivion! My family's banner's been stolen. It's been an heirloom of my house for hundreds of years."
"3952276-0-4538";"A few. One you might be able to help with. To the east of Vlastarus lies Juras Falls, haunted by undead. A former friend of mine, Captain Juras, walks among them. He should be at peace. Would you lay him to rest?"
"3952276-0-4539";"We were on our way back to Windhelm. We decided to take a short cut and those monsters surrounded us.\n\nI've never seen anything like them before."
"3952276-0-4540";"The Ebonheart Pact is fighting for control of Cyrodiil against both the Daggerfall Covenant and the Aldmeri Dominion."
"3952276-0-4541";"These ""Dreamers"" stole my crystal and broke it.  They're trying to summon Daedra with the shards!"
"3952276-0-4542";"The Argonian and Dark Elf leaders are ready to meet. It's time to gather a council of war.\n\nDo you think you could convince the thanes to attend as well? They're an independent lot, but their advice would be welcome."
"3952276-0-4544";"<<1>> has been taken over by ghosts who can somehow control flame atronachs. As if regular ghosts weren't bad enough! Ayleid ruins just seem to attract evil.\n\nThe ruins are to the north. Will you help us?"
"3952276-0-4545";"The Bad Man is one of the old gods, the source of all strife and the god of crop failure. According to local tradition, appeasing him will ensure a good harvest. Superstitious nonsense, but an excellent excuse for a festival!"
"3952276-0-4546";"Our resident artist, Nayya, is sulking. She insists she needs silver scales to create her next piece. Sadly, Silverscale Pond has been overfished by poachers. If you can steal some of the scales from them, I'll pay for them."
"3952276-0-4548";"This silly cult threw me in this cage for me to rot, just because I took back my Crystal.  Get me out of this cage at once!"
"3952276-0-4549";"You don't know? The big folk prepare to march to war. I sense that you and the big folk share a common foe.\n\nI'd say you arrived just in time. I like that in a champion."
"3952276-0-4550";"Ah, yes. The scouting reports. He wants you to sneak into Skuldafn while we distract the bulk of the Orcthane's army.\n\nSkuldafn is special to the Nords. Jorunn always planned to hold the moot there. But then Fildgor moved in."
"3952276-0-4551";"As many stories as there have been Silvenars. Going back to the first Bosmer, no doubt!\n\nBut the story the spinners are telling now, it's all wrong. It must change back before it's too late."
"3952276-0-4552";"The name is Finvir. I was part of the circle of mages that summoned the Dremora Lord now posing as the Bad Man. I can help keep his power in check, but I'll need your help."
"3952276-0-4557";"<<1>> tried to stop the Worm Cult from defiling this burial site. They took her! I saw her near the center of Ouze, held captive at one of the altars.\n\nI can't imagine what they'll do to her if someone doesn't stop them!"
"3952276-0-4561";"The notes you discovered suggest two weaknesses in the fort's defenses—the gates and the captive mammoths. Once you get inside, you must free the mammoths to cause havoc and unlock the gates to let us in."
"3952276-0-4563";"Taking a break, waiting for some friends. I'm a royal road worker. Do you appreciate the flat, even roads throughout Eastmarch? You can thank us for those.\n\nWe've earned a little relaxation. We're throwing a celebration in Cragwallow."
"3952276-0-4566";"I was assaulted by the same creatures that attacked Cragwallow. You track these monsters?\n\nThen I implore you to aid a dying old man."
"3952276-0-4567";"<<1>> tried to stop the Worm Cult from defiling this burial site. They took her! I saw her near the center of Ouze, held captive at one of the altars.\n\nI can't imagine what they'll do to her if someone doesn't stop them!"
"3952276-0-4572";"<<1>> caught my daughter with the son of the Drublog chief, <<2>>. \n\nWe normally live near the Drublog with only minor squabbles. But now they've gone too far!"
"3952276-0-4575";"My sister Kireth and I traveled from Morrowind in search of forgotten lore and ancient relics.\n\nThe scholars at Shad Astula laughed at us and the Mages Guild ignores us, but we're going to find something they can't ignore."
"3952276-0-4576";"Our research points to a treasure trove of lore buried in these ruins. I even found one of the lore vaults. It had a Dwemer memory device and everything!\n\nBut the area is buried in snow and swarming with constructs. Also, we need a key."
"3952276-0-4578";"We've all been infected. Cursed. Plagued. Call it what you will. We're vampires. But we don't have to succumb to the curse's savage nature.\n\nMy father thinks otherwise."
"3952276-0-4579";"I am Keeper Cirion, warden of the Banished Cells.\n\nThe Daedra have helped my prisoner, High Kinlord Rilis XII, to escape his prison. Rilis is an immortal phantom who wields powerful magic—you should return to the surface and warn Tamriel."
"3952276-0-4580";"I wanted to give you a short tour of our holy sites. <<1>> is home to the last two Green Ladies, and some say the first as well. \n\nPilgrims often visit our village to pay homage to the shrine of the Green Lady."
"3952276-0-4582";"The Ashlanders are inside the temple. They've broken through an old storage tunnel under the hillside.\n\nWe'll all be killed!"
"3952276-0-4584";"Welcome to Cragwallow! The Skald-King's royal road workers live here during repair season. Have you used any of the flat, smooth roads in Eastmarch? That's our work.\n\nWe've been working hard and now it's time to celebrate. You should join us!"
"3952276-0-4587";"Just your run-of-the-mill pirate infestation. The Steel Shrikes, they call themselves. We made landfall for our show, and they attacked!\n\nCan you believe it? And now most of my boys're missing. Those Shrikes don't eat Elves, do they?"
"3952276-0-4588";"Getting us back on the road, of course! A performer always lands on his feet. Well, usually.\n\nFirst act will require our senche. I saw those ruffians tormenting the poor thing on the beach. If you free him, I'm almost positive he won't maul you."
"3952276-0-4591";"Your king has fallen into a deep, eternal sleep. You cannot aid him. His fate depends on the favor of the Three Old Gods now."
"3952276-0-4592";"Go talk to Thane Mera. She led a small team up through this pass and into Skuldafn.\n\nWe need to find a way to get the rest of the soldiers through the pass without drawing the attention of the Stormfists."
"3952276-0-4593";"Fildgor opened a bridge between this world and Sovngarde. His royal blood grants him access to the hallowed halls of our ancestors, no matter what foul atrocities he has performed.\n\nEven now, he works his dark magic there, siphoning off my soul."
"3952276-0-4594";"The dead emerged from Bonestrewn Barrow. I was working when it started. I buried my axe in three of them, but they kept on coming. \n\nMy family's still out there and the countryside is crawling with those damn creatures!"
"3952276-0-4596";"We use a Sphere of Storms to control the weather and defend our shores. Crushed a few of the Sea Viper's ships before they managed to land.\n\nNow we're waiting on reinforcements. Hope they get here in time to do some good."
"3952276-0-4599";"Pray to the Three Old Gods. Seek their blessings and call upon their aspects to aid you.\n\nThey might help you, but each in a different way. Remember what the Dreamwalker said and be open to any way an aspect may aid you."
"3952276-0-4600";"The Worm Cult. Swarmed the farm, cutting and burning. Our screams must have alerted the giant camp nearby.\n\nThey went berserk and stomped down out of the hills. That's when I ran."
"3952276-0-4601";"The Worm Cult, Shor take them. Came out of nowhere, burning and killing. Our screams must have carried over the hill to the giant camp. They went berserk!"
"3952276-0-4602";"Thank you. The gods know I could use your help.\n\nIt's taking all my energy to maintain this projection. The Drublog captured me and my traveling companions. They're holding us prisoner in Jathsogur."
"3952276-0-4604";"The Orcthane Fildgor … his troops have commandeered the mine and taken our ore.\n\nThey force half of us to work and serve as hostages. Then at the end of the shift, they take our tools and keep the ore. My family is down there right now."
"3952276-0-4606";"Magister Osanne. She searches the deeper chambers. \n\nWe broke into an ice cave and found an ore we had never seen. It seems to have magical properties. Before we could determine anything else, these thugs arrived."
"3952276-0-4607";"As our ship neared <<1:)>>, a black fog spread across the waters. Soon after, Maormer raiding parties attacked and boarded the ship.\n\nMany of my shipmates were slaughtered."
"3952276-0-4608";"This Maormer whelp says <<1>> took the captain to a nearby cave, not far from where you saved me. And, he says, there's a back way out."
"3952276-0-4609";"You could say that. I want to burn the Maormer sailboats. Make it difficult for them to attack other ships in distress. It's hard to sneak up on someone while rowing.\n\nHm. Interested in lighting some fires?"
"3952276-0-4611";"The Worm Cult killed him to fuel their dark magic.\n\nMy Treva, and some of the farm hands … they're trapped, enslaved in the cult's Animus Geodes!"
"3952276-0-4612";"My name is Treva, and I built the blasted farm with my own two hands. Those cult bastards murdered me and stuffed my family into their damned geodes."
"3952276-0-4613";"Someone's let the mammoths out of their pen. They're acting drunk. Someone must have slipped rotmeth into their water again.\n\nA few of us got injured trying to sober them up."
"3952276-0-4614";"My cousin, on my pa's side. Her father's missing, and the family says Yiri saw what happened. Problem is, he went missing during the attack. But he wasn't anywhere near the west wall."
"3952276-0-4616";"I don't want to alarm Jomund, after all we've been through today. But I think that Magister Osanne sent word to the Orcrthane about the strange magical ore.  \n\nLooks like Filgdor sent someone to investigate. They set up a small camp down the road."
"3952276-0-4618";"Just a couple of things, really. Thunderbug hearts from the wild thunderbugs down the hill. And some maggots.\n\nAnd, well, if you want to know, there's something else bothering me."
"3952276-0-4619";"We've done what we can for Shor's Stone. The villagers can deal with the aftermath. We have other concerns.\n\nWhile we were here, the Reachmen attacked Fallowstone Hall!"
"3952276-0-4620";"I'm almost sorry we discovered that mysterious metal. I don't know what to do with it, but I don't want King Jorunn's enemies to have it, either.\n\nA friend of mine at Fort Amol might be able to tell us more about the metal."
"3952276-0-4621";"They are building an army of Daedra! Their leader, that bastard, Thalik Wormfather stole Ysgramor's axe, Wuuthrad. He has roused the ghost giant Sinmur."
"3952276-0-4622";"The cultists, the Daedra. They overwhelm every force we send against them. These men and women need our help."
"3952276-0-4623";"I am. I overheard Magister Osanne say she sent word to the Orcthane about an unusual discovery.\n\nAfter I told Tridi what I heard, she decided to scout the area. We don't want any more surprises."
"3952276-0-4624";"The city is sealed against me … something I would not have thought possible. It would take the power of—\n\nOf course! The three spinners! They could do it, if they were forced by someone powerful. Someone like the Hound."
"3952276-0-4625";"I'm Laen the Doorwalker, a simple bard.\n\nMy fellow minstrels and I were chosen from throughout the Dominion to perform at the celebrations for the Silvenar and the Green Lady, but something went horribly wrong!"
"3952276-0-4626";"I was once the Green Lady. When I died, I was drawn to rest in this sacred grove—Treehenge. All past Green Ladies rest here, since the first set foot in Valenwood.\n\nSomething blocks my entrance. Something vile!"
"3952276-0-4627";"Refugees from Narsis. We came here to escape the plague, but were set upon by highwaymen. I was separated from my group, and my husband. \n\nPlease, I must find Garil, but the half-wit at the barricade won't let me through!"
"3952276-0-4628";"I'll take any help I can get.\n\nWe tracked the Worms from Stony Basin. Got here just ahead of the cult. I guess that's why some of the delvers still live. And a few of my men."
"3952276-0-4631";"King Jorunn and the Ebonheart Pact leaders are meeting here. Between the Nords, the Argonians, and the Dark Elf contingent, they've filled up the inn. They even had to set up tents on the far side of town."
"3952276-0-4632";"I returned triumphantly from glorious mission to Dark Elf lands and Thane Mera put me in charge of Skald-King's big party. \n\n""You like a good party,"" she says. ""Of course!"" I say. ""No one parties like Rigurt!"" Turns out whole thing is mammoth dung."
"3952276-0-4633";"My kwama mine's been taken over by thugs! They're tearing the place up—ruining it.\n\nWorse, I can't find my partner, Selos."
"3952276-0-4634";"I hate the thought of Garil wandering through those godsforsaken chambers all alone."
"3952276-0-4635";"That's the plan. The meeting will take place in Skyrim instead of Mournhold. The Nord ruler has his own artifact to contribute to the moot.\n\nTime to set sail for the land of ice and snow."
"3952276-0-4638";"<<1>>. She helped us escape, but no one's seen her since.\n\nAnd <<2>> is overrun with all manner of undead and their vile masters!"
"3952276-0-4639";"No! Don't touch the tomb! You'll be trapped forever with <<1>>!\n\nThose I hired as protection tricked me into this tomb and left me to rot. Thieves! I shouldn't have trusted them."
"3952276-0-4640";"Perhaps you can help her, then. There was an attempt on Thane Fjora's life. Her housecarl, the bastard. The sergeant and her squad arrived just afterward, to investigate."
"3952276-0-4644";"You'll find his majesty in the encampment just up the road. Watch yourself. The Worms have moved in force against us."
"3952276-0-4645";"The king speaks with his advisors in the camp just up the road. Be wary. The Worm Cult moves against us in force."
"3952276-0-4646";"Wuuthrad broken? I wonder if that's related. We're surrounded by undead. They come in waves. We expect another attack soon."
"3952276-0-4648";"I bought this parchment from a trader in <<1>>. He promised if I told my stories to it, they would bond to it and become permanent.\n\nForgive me, it's not your concern. I'll make it work."
"3952276-0-4652";"Yes! To the very edge of Tamriel if we must!\n\nI have sent troops into the Smokefrosts to warn Riften of his approach. But you should also head in that direction."
"3952276-0-4653";"Dark times befall Shadowfen; dark times indeed.\n\nMurders and disappearances in Stormhold, and the vicecanons can't find a culprit."
"3952276-0-4654";"They sense the Worm Cult grows desperate. <<1>> must join Treehenge before the Worm Cult can capture her again.\n\nThe fiends have turned to the spriggans for information."
"3952276-0-4655";"To Oblivion with military messengers. You wouldn't happen to be a volunteer? Have some experience with these Reachmen, yeah?"
"3952276-0-4658";"Turil, that old netch. He set bandits after me! They assaulted me on the road and took my silk. I want the bandits dead, and Turil in irons!"
"3952276-0-4664";"<<1>> sent word. He asks you join him soon as you can. An investigation has begun in the matter of Guildmaster Iceblade's death."
"3952276-0-4667";"Sage Tirora has passed to Sovngarde and Fallowstone needs a new sage. Skald Svari has asked my permission to try for the position and I have given it."
"3952276-0-4673";"The dead could throw themselves at the walls for weeks. What we need to do is push them back. Reopen the roads to Riften and Stonefalls.\n\nAre you up for an assault? Show the men that Bonebane sings again!"
"3952276-0-4674";"That's what I need to find out. We have to get into their camp. This isn't the same tribe we saw in Shor's Stone. No telling what they're doing.\n\nLots of corpses coming out of the mine. That can't be good."
"3952276-0-4676";"Forget it. Kill those Hagravens, make them pay for what they've done!"
"3952276-0-4677";"With Fort Morvunskar back under our control, we should send word to the King. Let him know that the royal tombs are secure. \n\nWill you deliver a dispatch to Fort Amol?"
"3952276-0-4678";"My friends and I dared each other to do great deeds and return here to tell the tales. But I've waited here for days and the others haven't returned.\n\nWill you seek out <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>?"
"3952276-0-4681";"Hssk. With the barrier down, we must unearth their purpose here. I and the other soldiers will guard the gate. Ensure the Reach do not strike from within."
"3952276-0-4684";"Captain Alhana should still be at the Keeper's house. Hopefully she's come up with a plan of some kind by now.\n\nI'll continue to watch over Droi. Find the Captain and let's put an end to this so we can finally get out of here."
"3952276-0-4693";"Aelif needs to speak to you immediately. I don't know what happened. She looked grim, so it can't have been good. You should find her as soon as possible."
"3952276-0-4694";"More or less. Thanks to my training and experience. I was taught to learn, to understand. To survive.\n\nThe Skald-King has discovered these things, as well. A rare leader, Jorunn. He's a ruler who listens."
"3952276-0-4695";"Sees-All-Colors requests you make your way to her as soon as possible. She said she hopes to ""make use of your prize."" She said you'd understand what that meant."
"3952276-0-4696";"My shield-sister Hakra was bound in the same manner as I. If the Worms came here, they might be there as well.\n\nPlease, travel north to Pinepeak Cavern. Discover if she remains bound and safe."
"3952276-0-4697";"Now that I'm free, I can sense Hakra, the spirit guardian at Pinepeak. She speaks to me, warning of a dark gathering at Honrich Tower, to the east."
"3952276-0-4698";"The Worm Cult mages guard the passage to <<1>>. A full assault would be suicidal, but a small force might push right through.\n\nEspecially with you at its head."
"3952276-0-4700";"We must fight past the last of the Worm Cultists ahead of us. Then we face Sinmur and Thallik. That merging is a foe worthy of Ysgramor, yet it falls to us to face them."
"3952276-0-4701";"<This amulet is inscribed with the name of the fallen soldier. Other Pact bodies may also have identifying amulets.>"
"3952276-0-4702";"The guild has accepted an unusual contract. We've agreed to eradicate Daedric Anchors when they drop from the sky. Wherever they appear, Molag Bal's minions soon follow."
"3952276-0-4713";"Fildgor Orcthane and his Stormfists! Nothing but cowards and thieves, if you ask me.\n\nSoldiers are supposed to be honorable, noble. But they slaughtered the Voljar family. They killed unarmed civilians! And they killed my brother's wife."
"3952276-0-4715";"I hired the Gold Coast mercenaries, just beyond our gates. For protection. But now, they're more of a threat than anything else.\n\nSoon, they'll tire of our excuses."
"3952276-0-4716";"A Redguard force made landfall and assaulted Velyn Harbor! They must've made a deal with the Drublog clan of Wood Orcs, as they attacked from the hills at the same time.\n\n<<1>> was at the docks. She's either dead or cut off. That leaves me in charge."
"3952276-0-4717";"Oh, it will not be me. Or you, I'm afraid. We extend this courtesy to our Gold Coast friends.\n\nI have a powder that causes deep sleep for many days. Afterwards, the user is too groggy to move, much less fight."
"3952276-0-4718";"<<1>>, the leader of the Drublog. I didn't realize what he'd done until I got in here. When it was too late ….\n\nI bet he's in the town hall—the big, unburnt building behind this one."
"3952276-0-4719";"While you were aiding the King, a runner arrived from Fort Morvunskar. The fort is under attack! Fildgor and the Stormfist clan are certainly behind the attack. It can't be mere coincidence!\n\nWindhelm must be protected, but we can't abandon the fort."
"3952276-0-4720";"What? Who do you think …? Oh … you want to help me?\n\nHow generous of you. I actually could use help. I'm a traveler, you see. I was touring the residential district when the Drublog attacked."
"3952276-0-4721";"""Nordahl showed us the shard of Wuuthrad tonight. It was very impressive! He's shown great cunning to find it. Our brothers and sisters scour the Smokefrost Peaks looking for Ysgramor's legacy."""
"3952276-0-4722";"Your kind abandoned this place to rot, so my sisters and I took it back. Made it grow again.\n\nBut now it's lost to us, and we must hide—for evil serpents have come, and driven the wild things mad."
"3952276-0-4723";"Now our enemies stoop so low as to ally themselves with Daedra?\n\nThe poison will kill the King before we can get him to the healers in Windhelm. And no one here can cure a poison like this. We need to ask the Ternion monks for help."
"3952276-0-4724";"Business? We have no business, stranger! No war, no Orcs, and no giants. We just relax and enjoy the hot springs.\n\nBut now that you mention it …."
"3952276-0-4725";"A stranger offers aid? You dare to put your own life in danger for the benefit of others?\n\nThat sounds too good to be true."
"3952276-0-4726";"The Sigil represents our bond. The forest and my clan … we have an understanding. We take wood, we build. \n\nBut as we do, we honor the forest. And the spirit of the forest protects us."
"3952276-0-4728";"Sort of. <<1>> has translated Sheogorath's tome, but we're having some trouble understanding it. She may need your assistance. Seek her out, soon as you can."
"3952276-0-4729";"<<1>> has finished final analysis of the tomes! We're ready to get my island back!"
"3952276-0-4730";"Can't you smell the smoke? Silsailen is under attack! I barely got my father out alive! The Canonreeve, almost slain!\n\nThese brutes may wear the uniforms of the First Auridon Marines, but they're imposters."
"3952276-0-4732";"We stand upon a rift between the planes. Here, the border between the living and dead blurs.\n\nI died many years ago. During the Akaviri invasion. Yet here I stand, hoping that help will arrive."
"3952276-0-4734";"Name's Bragur. I tend the books and artifacts here. A thousand stories in every one. You're up and around. Ask your help? Pint of mead in it for you! If I ever go drinking again."
"3952276-0-4738";"An excellent question, for which I have no answer. \n\nMy dear sister, your Queen, brought us here to perform a ceremonial ritual. It's a bit of political theater, really. Gain the blessings of the dead and all that rubbish."
"3952276-0-4739";"Ha! Confidence and swagger! I like that. \n\nWell, let's see you beat my record. Even Eastmarch's best hunter over there couldn't catch that many rabbits in under a minute. But I'll make it easy for you. One rabbit keeps eluding me. Nab it and you win."
"3952276-0-4740";"Maormer pirates. They've taken South Beacon. My captain, my crew. All captured.\n\nThey took control of the lighthouse. This is bad. With South Beacon as a staging area they can raid the Summerset Isles at will."
"3952276-0-4741";"Truly? This is the last time I trust an order to that Bosmer. It fits, though. Ezduiin has been one disaster after another. First, the spirits. Now the supplies. And to top it off, my top scholar and her team are missing!"
"3952276-0-4742";"A fair day, indeed. I'm studying the spirits that now haunt these ruins. I believe they can be released. Sent on to their final reward.\n\nPerhaps you'd be willing to help with an experiment?"
"3952276-0-4743";"The leader of the dig? The one who ordered the supplies? You're an odd merchant.\n\nYou'll find him at the camp just up the path. Fair day."
"3952276-0-4744";"Teldur asked Canonreeve Valano for a word outside. When they didn't return, I went to look for them. I caught a glimpse of them heading towards the manor. Teldur was holding a knife to my father's side!"
"3952276-0-4746";"I must make for the ancient site known as Tanzelwil. Normally, a new monarch communes quietly with the dead.\n\nWe're supposed to show willingness to heed the wisdom of our ancestors."
"3952276-0-4748";"I'm not entirely certain. But it does look menacing, doesn't it? \n\nThese stones appeared overnight, at key locations throughout the ruins. It's no coincidence that the ancestral spirits went mad that very day. I'm certain there's a connection."
"3952276-0-4749";"We need to warn the settlements west of here. You put a stop to Stral and the Reachmen, but the Worms are a far bigger menace."
"3952276-0-4750";"An errand of mercy. Two of my friends—Laudine and Varius—were taken by vampires in Lipsand Tarn. By now, they are dead, or worse. No one should suffer such a fate.\n\nI beg you to find their bodies and burn them."
"3952276-0-4752";"Just keeping a low profile. Since you found me, want to help me get some revenge?\n\nThe Black Dagger bandits in Hackdirt wiped out my gang. Kill ten of them and I'll reward you."
"3952276-0-4753";"Maormer raiding parties attacked and boarded our ship in the midst of a black fog.\n\nIn the chaos, I saw them kill many of my shipmates. So many dead."
"3952276-0-4754";"Maormer boarded us as our ship neared <<1:)>>. How they found us in that black fog, I'll never know.\n\nThey slaughtered most of the crew. Only a few of us escaped."
"3952276-0-4755";"The Black Daggers have been plaguing this part of Cyrodiil. With the empire at war, there's no one to stop them. \n\nA few days ago, they broke into the priory and stole the Claw of Akatosh."
"3952276-0-4756";"Never mind me! It was a balance, a sacred trust. The Worm Cult came and broke that trust with the mammoths, and now ….\n\nWe were simply observers! But they struck, destroying countless documents …."
"3952276-0-4757";"<<1>>. Again. I bet the Worm Cult caught her. She said she'd meet me here after going back for <<2>>. They're both long overdue.\n\nI'd go back, but someone's got to keep watch. Maybe you could help me."
"3952276-0-4759";"They're camped all over Abamath, preparing some dark ritual. They planned to sacrifice us.\n\n<<1>> helped me escape. She was right behind me! Please, I'm too weak to face them alone. Will you search their camps for her?"
"3952276-0-4762";"Well, it's not just the Reachmen. The Worm Cult haunts these woods. They perform foul rituals amid the old stones."
"3952276-0-4763";"We came to Vernim expecting to find Reachmen, those stinking beasts. Instead we found the place ripe with the smell of necromancy. The Worm Cult is here, in Skyrim."
"3952276-0-4764";"Riften … Giant … attacked! Pact army in pursuit … many wounded. Guard Captain Viveka leading recovery effort. North of town. We need help."
"3952276-0-4767";"Wyress Ileana went to find out what happened to the guardians. We haven't heard from her since."
"3952276-0-4774";"If I am to be Queen, I must look fear in the face and conquer it. How can I ask my people to have faith in me if I don't have faith in myself?"
"3952276-0-4775";"An entertainment troupe from Morrowind made the party something special. Even the Dremora forgot to be angry all the time. They made the perfect distraction. But before I could take advantage, the troupe died. If we could get them back …."
"3952276-0-4776";"My friend Lucius was due back days ago from Pell's Gate. He still hasn't arrived. \n\nThe supplies he was carrying are vital, both for the priory and Chorrol."
"3952276-0-4782";"Shadowed Path necromancers have taken over Lindai, an Ayleid ruin to the east. Evil emanates from this ruin; these foul mages have used that energy to transform one of their number into a lich!"
"3952276-0-4783";"Freezing to death. You? Jorunn dispatched me to follow a group of cultists. The damned cats didn't know about my mission. Cut me up bad. \n\nI felt like I was going to be fine … until I ran out of wood. It's right over there. Taunting me."
"3952276-0-4785";"Yes, please. Bandits have been plaguing us since the war broke out. The Black Daggers are the worst of them all."
"3952276-0-4786";"Wayrest investigators bleed for a living. I'm fine.\n\nMy people and I were here, looking into reports of armed wastrels seen passing through the sewers, when one of our own betrayed us."
"3952276-0-4787";"Thrice-damned lowlifes are no marines, I can tell you that much. In fact, Commander Tendil's detachment should have been here a long time ago. I think they were ambushed."
"3952276-0-4788";"I hope so. An old friend of mine, Captain Minwe, died and was buried near Narsinfel ruins. But someone's raised her, to haunt the ruins. I'd like her to be at rest. You interested in granting her some peace?"
"3952276-0-4789";"Aye! Most come just to drink and dance. But a brave few come to earn the title of Geirmund's Guardian.\n\nIf you're interested, talk to the Thane. He's our host, after all."
"3952276-0-4790";"Want to get knocked about, eh? Lots of folk around looking for a brawl. Go pick a few.\n\nReport back once you've knocked in some teeth."
"3952276-0-4791";"Ahh, yes. Like the skalds of old, this will be a trial of riddles and rhymes.\n\nI tell you the riddle. The answer to each can be found around the island. You find it, place it in this sack, and bring it to me. Got it?"
"3952276-0-4792";"So glad you asked! In a word: poison. Well, poisoned mead. Well, over-fermented mead.\n\nHere, just take this brew. It's the key to the door you're about to open."
"3952276-0-4793";"Jakaral, Logod, and I went to the giant camp near Ivarstead. We had a few meads, and well, we thought we could charm the beasts with our music. Like in the tales?\n\nIt didn't go well."
"3952276-0-4794";"Talk to my sister Aelm inside the pub. She'll set you straight.\n\nJust mind how quick you drink. This ain't Elf wine."
"3952276-0-4795";"Worm Cultists! Captain Viveka led our patrol against their camp but they ambushed us. We tried to fight our way out. I'm the only one who escaped. The others are either dead or captive."
"3952276-0-4796";"I'll just write that down. By order of the First Auridon Marines, your presence in Vulkhel Guard has been registered.\n\nDo your best to stay out of trouble and out of the way. Fare you well."
"3952276-0-4798";"You're damned right there's something wrong! I needed to sail for Velyn Harbor hours ago. I've got cargo still to load, and crew members deep in their cups around town. \n\nI'd let the guard have the lot of them, if I could afford it."
"3952276-0-4799";"She sent word. She's moved to protect the Queen. That'll be at the manor house.\n\nStars guide your steps now."
"3952276-0-4800";"As you should be. She could use your help.\n\nThe Queen is here to perform a ritual. She seeks a blessing, but the dead have grown angry. They attack without provocation."
"3952276-0-4801";"I see that Aldmeri spies have infiltrated the celebration. Sanguine welcomes all, but all must partake of his drink. If these spies wish to remain, they must drink from Sanguine's goblet. Then they will be bound to the party."
"3952276-0-4802";"You've worked with the Eyes? Auri-El provides. \n\nDaedra run rampant, portals to Oblivion have opened within the city, and an army from the Deadlands threatens to take Firsthold."
"3952276-0-4804";"Each gate is maintained by a sigil stone. Enter the portal, find the stone, and destroy it. \n\nRaz is going to guess they will be guarded."
"3952276-0-4805";"You're one of Raz's? Thank Mara! We could use you. \n\nThere are Daedra everywhere. Portals to Oblivion opened within the city and an army of beasts threatens to take Firsthold."
"3952276-0-4806";"Well, that lava fissure running through town is dangerous. The heat and fumes are bad enough, but flame atronachs are issuing from it, attacking citizens. If you'd kill four of them and thin out the herd, we'd all appreciate it."
"3952276-0-4809";"The Black Daggers have set an ambush for me, north of here. I'd like to show them that I still have friends. Feel like triggering a trap?"
"3952276-0-4810";"Everyone in town is so grateful to Hendil. But I don't trust him. Or that little toad Amuur. My youngest son's been down there for a week! Why?"
"3952276-0-4813";"Perhaps. I hear the merchant Bar-Neeus may be peddling illegal goods in the central market. If this could be proved, he'd be ruined and we would take his place."
"3952276-0-4815";"My situation here is precarious. If the Black Daggers find out I'm still alive, they'll come after me, hard. I need supply caches in case I need to run. Want to fill one up for me?"
"3952276-0-4816";"The Queen's entourage. They were taken right out of our camp.\n\nA madman—a mage—teleported them away. The look in his eye!"
"3952276-0-4817";"Well, it's safe here. Outside, not as much, with the Gold Coast mercenaries looking for trouble.\n\nFrom the looks of it, you know how to take care of yourself. Honored Eraral-dro should meet you, I think."
"3952276-0-4818";"<<1>> led the bulk of our army to Trolhetta, but there's a snag. The Worms have dug in. We'll root them out, don't worry. But it's taking time.\n\nJorunn sent me to update you. Apparently, you're important."
"3952276-0-4819";"I'm incredibly bored. I got lost on a long trip, and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere.\n\nOnly two things relieve my stultifying boredom: a book sitting next to me and the book sitting next to that one."
"3952276-0-4820";"Yes, but don't go looking to pull me up, you'll likely break my back. I need my cane. Those two ruffians dancing like idiots over there stole it from me."
"3952276-0-4821";"The Reachmen are gathering in the Wood. Gjakil needs all able blades to head there right away!"
"3952276-0-4822";"There was an attempt on the thane's life. Her housecarl, of all people. Bastard. Sergeant Aera and her squad arrived just recently to look into the matter."
"3952276-0-4823";"Aye. I've finally found my way in the world. The Pact has given me purpose, a reason to live beyond Bleakrock. \n\nI'm actually here on a mission, but I'm a bit over my head. Can I ask an old friend for help?"
"3952276-0-4824";"<The statue is warm to the touch.>"
"3952276-0-4825";"A moment. I can feel something. There's a cave, north of here. \n\nWhatever this monster is, dispatch it. And we can return the Grove to peace."
"3952276-0-4828";"Can you handle a room full of drunken Nords? I need to get a book from that tavern across the street.\n\nThe author is sitting in there drinking right now! Can you believe it? Skald Skullsplitter is here!"
"3952276-0-4829";"The Cult. They killed us all. Our loved ones in Riften must be told. Help us, please!"
"3952276-0-4831";"Of course! Folks come from all around the Rift to take part in the trials. And perhaps earn the title of Geirmund's Guardian.\n\nIf you're interested, talk to Thane Vofknir."
"3952276-0-4832";"Folk from around the Rift come to feast at Geirmund's Hall. Every year, the Thane hosts a competition to name a champion.\n\nIf you're interested, speak to Vofknir up at the manor."
"3952276-0-4833";"The King's Arrow, yes? Well met.\n\nTell no one that Betar-Nes was a member of the Worm Cult. I won't have Nimalten fall into chaos. We're on his trail. My advisor and the court mage search for any hint of the cult as we speak."
"3952276-0-4834";"The Drublog have been raiding villages all over. We survived, but just barely.\n\nAll I can offer my people is a place to mourn. But their children's bodies are still out there, being scavenged by Drublog … and worse."
"3952276-0-4835";"Shattered? Wuuthrad? What is this nonsense? You think to deceive me with wild tales?\n\nI know why you're really here. The Jarls sent you to spy on me. Either that, or you're in league with the risen dead!"
"3952276-0-4837";"I've just come from Pinepeak Caverns. The Worm Cult ambushed us. There are researchers there trapped in the caverns. I fear the worst!"
"3952276-0-4842";"Those gibbering Broken Coast bastards won't leave me be! They seek my treasure, but they'll not have it! Not cup nor bone!\n\nIf my cursed eyes could see, I'd take up an axe and crack some skulls like the old days."
"3952276-0-4843";"Teldur asked Canonreeve Valano for a word outside. When they didn't return, I went to look for them. I caught a glimpse of them heading towards the manor. Teldur was holding a knife to my father's side!"
"3952276-0-4844";"You're not the killer, I suppose; that would be too easy. But I don't want to leave Raerana alone while I search for clues. The killer might still be around."
"3952276-0-4846";"Plague. Stay away if you value your life. A dozen people afflicted over the last week."
"3952276-0-4847";"Plague. Coin's the only reason I'm here. My crew is under contract."
"3952276-0-4848";"Nobody knows. Started popping up in some of the kids, then spread. Soldiers aren't worth much around here. Don't expect a lot of help."
"3952276-0-4850";"That poor man over there had his cane stolen by a couple of hooligans. Go help him, why don't you?"
"3952276-0-4851";"Barothlas and I hoped this would be the year Falinesti returned to its Summer Site. We found nothing but a hole in the ground at first.\n\nThen a few days ago, we saw flashes of lightning in the valley!"
"3952276-0-4853";"Harnald sent me here to investigate Worm Cult sightings. Turns out they're enacting some nasty ritual up there. \n\nHe expects me to stop it but there's no way. Those cultists would murder me!"
"3952276-0-4855";"Her majesty set this one a task—investigate the leadership of the Veiled Heritance. The Veil's trail leads here, to the town of Mathiisen. \n\nWell known for their steel blades, yes? But also, apparently, weaponsmiths for anarchists."
"3952276-0-4856";"All right, now. You trust in Razum-dar, yes? He must ask you to trust him further. Malanie, Condalin. They are in the town barracks. You must go in, make a big noise. \n\nThey will almost certainly capture you."

"3952276-0-5066";"Healer Dalen. He was headed to Eidolon's Hollow to tend to the wounded. He wanted Dremora hearts. He uses them to craft healing potions.\n\nI collected a few, but he was gone by the time I returned. How will he make his potions without them?"
"3952276-0-5067";"The troops like to know the gods are on their side. I am not a pious man, but I understand the need for reassurance. There is a small shrine to the west. Would you deliver the troops' petitions to the gods?"
"3952276-0-5068";"Excellent. It's been fascinating to work with Shalidor. Even though he can't read the book, he's been an invaluable resource. I had to decipher layers-upon-layers of meaning hidden within the tome."
"3952276-0-5069";"I'm captain of the independent sailing vessel Albatross. We found a map to an Imperial treasury that led us here, to <<Ac:1>>. But when we tried to claim it, our fortunes ebbed with the tides."
"3952276-0-5072";"Of course! Dear old Baan Dar holds the Boast every year. Folk come from far and wide to play tricks on one another. It's a festival of fun. And the best tricksters get to dance and drink the night away in Baan Dar's realm."
"3952276-0-5073";"I'm called Pirondil, an investigator for the First Auridon Marines. I spotted a Goblin sneaking into this cave … it was wearing Elven armor.\n\nI followed it, but I was ambushed by that woman."
"3952276-0-5074";"Valaste has finished translating the tome. Once you're ready, join us at the Mages Guild. Speak to Valaste when you arrive. I'll be making preparations for your first trial."
"3952276-0-5079";"When a king sends his army somewhere, I think his intentions are pretty clear. Always knew the Covenant was a bad idea.\n\nApparently, King Fahara'jad thinks we're stupid too if he expects us to just welcome his soldiers into the castle."
"3952276-0-5080";"To attack the castle. Isn't that obvious? This is the beginning of the end for the Covenant. Mark my words.\n\nKing Fahara'jad probably planned this all along. Thought that under the banner of peace, we'd just let his army march right in."
"3952276-0-5081";"Oh, I thought you were someone else. I guess I'm still seeing double. And … also hallucinating.\n\nI took a blow to the head during the mutiny. Been double hallucinating ever since."
"3952276-0-5084";"I could give you a list to be sure, but my concerns are more general. \n\nThere are rumors of assassins and spies in the castle, and as I was leaving, I heard something about a Redguard army marching in that direction."
"3952276-0-5085";"We've had an urgent message from Shor's Stone. They're under attack by Reachmen.\n\nTheir numbers and ferocity are beyond anything the defenders have seen before."
"3952276-0-5087";"Oh, thank the stars! I've been trapped in this dank catacomb for countless years. I'm bound here by a powerful necromantic ritual, and I'd rather that weren't the case."
"3952276-0-5088";"Worm Cult! They're everywhere.\n\nKireth—my sister, I mean—led a team here to investigate the ruin. We were this close to breaking into the barrow when the Worms attacked. I ran as fast as I could!"
"3952276-0-5089";"I'm dead, aren't I? No? That giant took me by surprise. Wrecked my wagon on the road and clubbed me so hard I swear I was swimming in the sky. I blacked out after that. I thought I'd wake in Sovngarde."
"3952276-0-5090";"Highwaymen. Thieves and cutthroats. Not uncommon in the Rift, but these have been more troublesome than most. We believe we know the identity of their leader, but we've been unable to track him down."
"3952276-0-5091";"Perhaps only his remains, but I'd like to know. A local claims to have known a trapper by that name who hunted in these hills. It might have been him, but I'm no fighter and this region is thick with bears."
"3952276-0-5093";"Khajiit tied himself up and is trying new fur-cleaning solution. What does it look like! Khajiit was captured! The Goblins snuck off to find carrots, he thinks. Khajiit must taste good with carrots.\n\nUntie Khajiit, he has offer for you."

"3952276-0-5097";"Another pair of eyes. I need to meet with the chieftain, <<1>>, and my travel will be limited. \n\nBut I can make a glamour—a disguise—for you. As a Drublog soldier, you'll be able to go where I can't."
"3952276-0-5099";"There's trouble at the Shrine of Saint Veloth. I came to find help, but it appears that Selfora has problems of its own."
"3952276-0-5100";"What do I not need help with?\n\nWe had a shrine to Azura here, but the Supernal Dreamers came and killed everyone, defiled the shrine, and stole our relics. I just want to get the relics back and take them to Pariah Abbey."
"3952276-0-5101";"No, no. The Grave is the prison in that cave ahead. Jakarn described it as a ghastly place. Traps block the exit and most criminals roam freely inside. \n\nBhosek accused him of stealing a gem and this Orc monster threw him in."
"3952276-0-5102";"Master Raston went into the Mabrigash camp and never returned. He wanted to open trade negotiations with the tribe, but I think something went wrong. He's been gone so long!\n\nWhat did he expect in a place called the Vale of the Ghost Snake?"

"3952276-0-5104";"It's <<1>>! She's tricked me in the last four Boasts! She always gets the better of me. This year I want to best her, and I know just how to do it. She's obsessed with Khajiiti puzzle boxes. I saw one in Yanabir's tent …."
"3952276-0-5105";"""Thane Fjora,\n\n""I pray this reaches you in time. Strangers recently visited our farm. Helgith glimpsed a charm bearing the sigil of the Worm Cult. We've seen it on the official warnings from Riften."""
"3952276-0-5106";"I'm going to Dra'bul, the Wood Orcs' nearest settlement. If <<1>> arrives, I'll send him on ahead.\n\nWhen you can, I'd appreciate your help in Dra'bul. You have a spear in this pig too, since you fought the Drublog here."
"3952276-0-5107";"At the moment, I'm fishing. I was sent to Selfora to get help for Master Raston, but it seems Selfora has problems of its own.  \n\nIf you're not doing anything, go to our trading post and speak to Tevynni Hadran. She could really use your help."
"3952276-0-5108";"Part of me hopes that all we find are a bunch of old crates that nobody cares about. But I've got one of those feelings. And I'm pretty sure it involves the Maulborn."
"3952276-0-5109";"Ah, she's gone to talk some sense into the Drublog Orcs. If anyone can do it, it's her.\n\nSay, weren't you the one helping out in Velyn Harbor? She said to send you on in if you passed by."
"3952276-0-5110";"How should Khali know? Look, this one knows a few spells. Can't have known my sister as long as I have without picking up a few things. Other than a few incantations, though, Khali leaves the heavy thinking to Shazah."
"3952276-0-5111";"Damn it. Without reinforcements Fort Grimwatch has fallen. And not from assault by an army. We were taken from within by Dro-m'Athra spirits! It was the Mane that let them loose!"
"3952276-0-5112";"They are a dreadful people. From the Worm Cult, I believe.\n\nThey destroyed numerous priceless artifacts, ruined decor, killed my employees. Then turned my employees into their employees by raising them as undead!"
"3952276-0-5113";"Thank the Moons. We hid our most valuable items before the Worm Cult arrived, but there's no one to retrieve them.\n\nWon't be long before they burn this temple down around us. Please. If you can find the artifacts—take them to Orthuna, our handler."
"3952276-0-5114";"Yet he managed to offend and insult nearly everyone. My visions tell me that you will decide this man's fate, as well as the fate of my tribe. \n\nYou will walk the Coiled Path and seek counsel with the Ghost Snake."
"3952276-0-5115";"My husband <<1>> ate too many moon-sugar candies. He started babbling to himself, then ran into the forest screaming, ""This one likes Bosmer! Plants are best friends!""\n\nI said he'd eat himself sick, but would he listen? No! Typical cat."
"3952276-0-5117";"I have a heist planned, a big one. Anyone who helps is going to be rich.\n\nBut I need people who aren't local, who aren't in the pocket of Headman Bhosek. Still interested?"

"3952276-0-5120";"My ship may be a pile of driftwood, but my crew's alive, and Captain Helane has them. I won't leave without them.\n\nHelp me rescue my crew and I'll help you with Kaleen's heist."

"3952276-0-5123";"Resting my twisted ankle. I was sent to Mournhold to get help for Master Raston, but an alit chased me into the swamp. Stupid alit.\n\nPlease, go to our trading post and speak to Tevynni Hadran. She could really use your help."
"3952276-0-5124";"Bloodthorn Cult. They're raising zombies all over the graveyard. I'm here to keep the people out until War Chief Tazgol arrives and crushes them all."

"3952276-0-5130";"You might not look like a Houndsman, but I don't trust you. I don't know who to trust any longer.\n\nGood thing the pilgrims stopped coming to pray at <<1>>'s shrine to the Green Lady."

"3952276-0-5137";"Chief Tazgol doesn't see the danger. The Bloodthorns are after an ancient Ayleid weapon that we know nothing about. We must catch up to Tazgol and stop him from rushing in!"
"3952276-0-5141";"Who knows? Neramo, I guess, but not me. I'm only here on Bhosek's orders, to make sure the Elf does his job. I never agreed to dig around in the sand for mad Dwarf toys."
"3952276-0-5142";"Headman Bhosek ordered me to help some crazy mage pilfer these ruins. Said to do whatever he asked, so here I am. \n\nWith any luck, the damned Elf will give up on getting inside. I need a drink."

"3952276-0-5144";"We do the heist and get off this rock. That aside, we shouldn't move on Bhosek until we are absolutely ready. Once we start this job, there's no going back."
"3952276-0-5145";"Yes. With all you did inside Jathsogur, I think the Drublog threat is finished. I can deal with any stragglers who come my way.\n\nBut I can't wait too long. <<1>> and my other guards sent word that I should get to the city of Silvenar."
"3952276-0-5146";"Thanks to your work, we can go ahead with the heist. We've even got a few extra sailors clamoring to join our crew.\n\nYou should talk to the captain upstairs."
"3952276-0-5147";"The same cult that attacked the fortress. I sense a link between the attack and the rituals. There is a way to be certain. Chief Tazgol has forbidden me from pursuing this, so I ask you to."
"3952276-0-5148";"The mammoths. They're drunk! <<1>>'s trying to corral them, but mammoths are dangerous to wake up, even when they're sober.\n\nThey've already trampled the herdsmen!"
"3952276-0-5149";"We hunt the Dark Mane, who has taken root deep within Moonmont. His legions have boiled up from below, killed most of the monks.\n\nAnd the beacons that mark the site as holy ground are grown dark. They fuel a ward lock upon the temple door."
"3952276-0-5150";"Oh, yes! An elite division of the Colovian army. Isn't it lovely? Took us by surprise and everything.\n\nI caught these bastards trying to sneak around the side. Such fun."
"3952276-0-5151";"No. The city is an extension of the Silvenar's mantle. Together, the Green Lady and the Silvenar join the spirit of the Bosmer with the world that gives them life.\n\nBut with the city closed to him, the handfast can't take place."
"3952276-0-5152";"Apologies, I'm just a little tired. Clan Mother Shuzura's last assistant, Rakhad, quit very suddenly, and Tazia has had to scramble. Many things to fix, many problems that need solving."
"3952276-0-5153";"What else would they be, damn it? I hear them down in the well. They must have found some way in. A back way. And lately some of the water has tasted funny. Bah!"
"3952276-0-5154";"You've seen the fields here, on the stead? Well, crops keep disappearing in the night. Plants just don't up and walk away!\n\nShuzura keeps telling Ezzag it's just children playing pranks, but he has lost half his crop this week!"
"3952276-0-5155";"Kalari is not even sure they are ghosts. She doesn't know what they are.\n\nI inherited this house from my uncle Enak-do. He passed away not too long ago. When my brother Mathal and I tried to move in … bah!"
"3952276-0-5156";"Yes, yes. Just don't let her talk down to you, all right? You've helped our village more today than she has in years. Hah!"
"3952276-0-5157";"Whenever we grow the village, we always try to make good use of the land and any useful resources. Like, say, the Ayleid ruins at the base of this tree.\n\nWe didn't do that for the aesthetics. We did it to give us options."
"3952276-0-5158";"Thank the Green, always nice to speak to someone with their eyes open. Sorry to impose but … since you're not here to worship, would you be willing to work?"
"3952276-0-5159";"Once again, I'm out in the field with the great and powerful Telenger. And, once again, he's trying very hard to drive me mad. Would you be willing to lend that crazy old wizard a hand?"
"3952276-0-5160";"Well these cultists for one, a Daedric temple for another. There's bound to be intrigue along the way. But come, enter and speak with me!"
"3952276-0-5161";"Master Telenger has lead us to a very interesting project here. If you'd like more details, speak to Andewen on the north side of the chasm. She's running the camp while the Artificer is inside the caves."

"3952276-0-5164";"The living call us Oathbreakers, and imprisoned us in Ouze for rejecting the Green Pact.\n\nBut these necromancers are harvesting us! We refused to bend to Y'ffre's will, and we won't bend to the Worm Cult!"

"3952276-0-5184";"You'd be wiser not to mock the gods. But there is something ….\n\nGoblins sometimes raid our warehouse, stealing food mostly. We normally just let them. A well-fed Goblin is far less dangerous. This time they took seeds, however."
"3952276-0-5185";"They killed everyone—my brothers and our five guards. They speared me good, left me for dead. I crawled here after they left.\n\nTheir new king's got them all riled up, ready to attack <<1>> and wipe out the town!"
"3952276-0-5186";"Two moons. He thought you were sent to find Zal-sa. <<1>> has run us ragged for weeks. No wonder her last assistant quit. That Rakhad had the right idea!\n\nZal-sa is off to try to find a job with Hadran. Or perhaps cleaning stalls at Thizzrini Arena."
"3952276-0-5187";"I woke up on the shore. No idea how I got here. Barely remember my name. And this damned monkey won't leave me alone. Must be mine. It just keeps hooting at me and won't go away.\n\nUgh. I need more ale."
"3952276-0-5188";"We regularly offer thanks to Zenithar for our prosperity. Everyone has always contributed. But four villagers are refusing this time. \n\nWould you speak with them and convince them to do their part?"
"3952276-0-5189";"Then you're not a bandit? Thank the Eight for small blessings.\n\nMy brother <<1>> wasn't as lucky. He thought he could outsmart the bandits in the ruins. Now he's gone. He'd do anything to find a cure for me, but all I pray for now is his safety."
"3952276-0-5190";"He's just down the hill, probably working on his damned barn. Tell him next time we're playing at his place. Shady bastard."
"3952276-0-5192";"A friend sent word she was planning a big job and needed help. That's why we sailed out here. Her name is Captain Kaleen.\n\nFind her at the Screaming Mermaid and drop my name. If we help her with her heist, she'll get us off this rock."

"3952276-0-5195";"Yeah. A lovely lady named Captain Kaleen might just be planning a heist. Thing is, most of <<1>> is in Bhosek's pockets, so she needs help that's not. Help like you and me.\n\nConvince Kaleen to cut us in, and we'll make some good money."

"3952276-0-5197";"My assistant, Shagol, disappeared again! More than likely, he's off spying on the town's women. If you gather six sacks of Cropsford's produce meant for sale, I'll pay you Shagol's wages. Do we have a deal?"
"3952276-0-5198";"Not here. Too many of Bhosek's ears around. I sent Lambur to scout out a nice quiet spot to gather our crew. Look for her at our hideout by the docks.\n\nI'll slip out and meet you there."

"3952276-0-5203";"With good reason! The undead walk the ruins of Culotte just to the southwest of here. If you'd eliminate some of them for us, I'd sleep a lot easier."
"3952276-0-5205";"I'm Nicolene! I work for Captain Kaleen. She sent me to find you, see if you'd had any luck recruiting for our heist. Looks like you're already making new friends."
"3952276-0-5206";"Yes. Milk Eyes has been in S'ren-ja for as long as I can remember. He likes to take care of himself, but I worry about that kind old man crawling down into his well."
"3952276-0-5207";"Fine! I'm sure she'll want to thank you for solving my problem, enough though she wouldn't have given me the time of day. Bah!"

"3952276-0-5452";"Dominion inspectors. Headwoman <<1>> requested their aid to stop smugglers.\n\nWe're honest farmers with good customers. Our moon-sugar is used to spice food, not to brew skooma! When the inspectors learn we can't protect our fields, we're finished!"
"3952276-0-5453";"It is beyond comprehension. Some of the greatest heroes in Alik'r's history have been laid to rest here.\n\nThey were consecrated—there is no way they can be re-animated. We deemed it an illusion at first, but then they started killing the priests."
"3952276-0-5454";"He'll likely be tending his barn at the edge of town. Like Kalari said, do not let his surly voice throw you off.\n\nInside, he's like a cuddly cub."

"3952276-0-5456";"Well, one of us is. We fled Pell's Gate, heading for the town of Vlastarus. We got separated in the confusion. I hope she made it. If you're headed there, will you look for her and let her know I'm on my way?"
"3952276-0-5457";"I was escorting my brother's wife to Vlastarus; Angiente is waiting for us there. But we ran into these undead last night and they killed Munya. I barely escaped. Now I'm waiting for a chance to run in, grab her body, and bring it to Angiente."
"3952276-0-5460";"His home is just up the hill behind this one's farm. Make sure when you see Milk-Eyes, you tell him he still owes Ezzag for their last match."

"3952276-0-5463";"You're going to think I'm crazy. But there's a cave not far from here. My apprentice and I camped there to get out of the weather, and when we woke up … a whole village had appeared out of nowhere! Full of Elves and homes and everything!"
"3952276-0-5466";"The situation? We're well and truly flummoxed! Before we could cross the Chasm, before we could confront Molag Grunda, we were stopped by a few pesky focus stones!\n\nThe wee ginger mage says that we have to break the stones, but good luck with that!"
"3952276-0-5469";"First, you need training. It starts with an easy task. Fangil waits at the Western Elsweyr gate with munitions for the siege range. The Transitus Shrine is the best way to get there and back. Viriniel can tell you more about it."
"3952276-0-5470";"Siege weapons are fascinating, yes? There is much to learn. There are several types, each very useful in its way.\n\nTo learn about rams and flaming oil, talk to Miniel by the tower. For trebuchets, catapults, and ballistae, talk to Firamo."

"3952276-0-5474";"You haven't met her, have you? Oh, you'll like her. \n\nShe's one of the last Veiled Heritants. They'll play the antagonists in this story. If you don't change the story, they end up killing the Wilderking. That would be very bad."

"3952276-0-5480";"Yes. The moons tell me that the spirits of the past spoke of a temple. The holy temple of Moonmont. Its walls once sang of moonlight. And now drip with the corruption of the Dark Mane."

"3952276-0-5493";"We entered the ruins to recover the stolen relics, but the bandits got the drop on us. Quick, break the lock on these chains. Get me out of here!"
"3952276-0-5496";"Not likely. You need training. Let's start with an easy task. Mirrored-Skin waits at the Southern Morrowind gate with munitions for the siege range. Use the Transitus Shrine to get there and back. Vother Herendas can tell you more about it."
"3952276-0-5497";"Nothing better than causing massive damage on the battlefield, is there?\n\nIf you want to know more about rams and oil, talk to Lirtis. For trebuchets, catapults, and ballistae, speak with Looks-Forward."

"3952276-0-5499";"Not so fast. First you need training. Start with Zahreh at the Northern High Rock gate. She has munitions to be delivered to the siege range. The Transitus Shrine is the best way to get there and back. Felycie Canis can tell you more about it."
"3952276-0-5500";"Like I tell all the new recruits, siege weapons rule the battlefield. So you need to know how to use them. To hear about trebuchets, ballistae, and catapults, talk to Jaleel. For battering rams and flaming oil, go find Marc."

"3952276-0-5525";"We've got a number of beehives, right? We've been looking to clear some of the forest, expand out, and hired a Mage to help make it happen. The buzz around town is that there's a problem. I don't know the details, though."

"3952276-0-5737";"I have a contract against the Black Daggers. They're bandits, scum who live only to make others miserable. The guild wants them cleaned out wherever we find them. You willing to go after them?"
"3952276-0-5738";"Our glorious Province General, Flaminius Auctor, has decided the Gray Viper gang needs a beating. They've been preying on defenseless towns and the guild wants to stand up for these people. You interested in this?"
"3952276-0-5739";"I think you'll like this one. We're offering a contract to take out members of the Shadowed Path cult. I bet you hate cultists as much as I do. Want to go cut some down?"
"3952276-0-5740";"Cautious. Good, I like that. You'll go far in the guild, my friend. The contract is against Goblins. Not that anyone ever needs a reason to kill Goblins, but they've become a huge problem in Cyrodiil. Want to hunt them for us?"
"3952276-0-5741";"Mayhaps you have heard of the Black Daggers, a scourge upon the face of Cyrodiil. The distress of their victims has moved the guild to offer contracts against these bandits. Will you accept one?"
"3952276-0-5742";"The Fighters Guild offers contracts against members of the Gray Viper bandit gang. Will you help the guild lessen the chaos in Cyrodiil?"
"3952276-0-5743";"The Shadowed Path cult feasts on the fear and despair swirling across Cyrodiil. The Fighters Guild is determined to thwart them. I offer guild contracts against these cultists."
"3952276-0-5744";"Listen then to what I offer. Goblins plague the good people of Cyrodiil. Towns are besieged, travelers are waylaid, none are safe. Will you accept a Fighters Guild contract against these creatures?"
"3952276-0-5747";"For you? Perhaps. The Viridian Sentinel once kept the wild at bay for the folk of Bangkorai, but his power wanes.\n\nSoon he may regret saving the princess of Evermore. Her mother already mourns her death, so why interrupt the natural course?"
"3952276-0-5748";"My husband is a talented minstrel. Very talented. We live in <<1>>, but he came to <<2>> to play for new faces.\n\nHe was only supposed to be gone for a few weeks, but after two months passed I figured I'd better come look for him."

"3952276-0-5757";"Lady Edwyge. Most beautiful woman I ever saw. I met her last night near the Mages Guild in Hallin's Stand. We talked, shared a jug of Zeht's Tears. I thought she liked me!\n\nShe asked to borrow a book from the Guild. And like a fool, I got it for her."
"3952276-0-5760";"Where they travel, the forest slowly withers and dies. We will drive Uela and her Dark Witnesses from here or we will die.\n\nUnfortunately, the old hag is no stranger to wyrd magic. She has constructed foul totems that suppress our power."

"3952276-0-5763";"I'm looking for a cup. Not just any cup, mind you. A Mages Guild cup. They call it the Emerald Chalice.\n\nThe Nord mage, Malofar, stole this relic. I offered my assistance and tracked Malofar here to Breagha-Fin—home to a group of Nord exiles."
"3952276-0-5764";"Amazing. What seemed like a hopeless situation has turned around completely. Believe it or not, I have good tidings to share with you too. \n\nImperial Magus-General Septima Tharn is requesting a parley. I'm hoping it's to discuss a peace settlement."
"3952276-0-5765";"Defending the city. If you're going to be sticking around, you're probably going to be defending yourself one way or another. \n\nIf you're willing though, Sergeant Antieve asked me to send any tough-looking types his way. He's at the west gate."
"3952276-0-5766";"Of course. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.\n\nI didn't think about it before, but I suppose this means the Reachmen are no longer a threat to Evermore either."
"3952276-0-5770";"This honorable and—if I may say so—very sleek guard has mistaken me for a common sugar-thief! Please, help me clear up this misunderstanding.\n\nHush, <<1>>, if you don't have anything constructive to say, don't say anything."

"3952276-0-5775";"I am unimportant. Only what I've done matters, and what I can do to fix it.\n\nI've waited for an opportunity to right this wrong since I escaped. Have you any strong love for the Imperials, or can you help?"
"3952276-0-5776";"Any help is welcome. Isabeth was last seen advancing toward the chapel to look for Hatmi.\n\nThe scouts' mission is to recover information and rescue civilians. We can't let the invaders reach Evermore."
"3952276-0-5777";"Are you living in a dog's den? Imperial skirmishers have been raiding this camp, stealing the knights' supplies!\n\nThis one and friends were just passing through, but the Baandari help when they can. Like Crazy Eye doesn't have anything better to do!"
"3952276-0-5778";"Everything's gone wrong since the Reachmen attacked.\n\nI'm waiting for reinforcements. You don't know our plight, either, so I doubt anyone knows what's happened."
"3952276-0-5779";"Sharp as a nail! Definitely no raw recruit.\n\nReachmen swarmed into Murcien's Hamlet. We were overrun, but I thought our leader had sent for reinforcements. Apparently not."
"3952276-0-5783";"If you haven't noticed, Rivenspire's caught up in a civil war as bloody as old Ranser's rebellion.\n\nThis time, it's Baron Montclair. He's apparently decided he'll be the King of Shornhelm whether the rest of the noble houses like it or not."
"3952276-0-5784";"As you might have guessed, I'm thinking you are best-suited for tracking down Reezal-Jul and making sure he doesn't go opening any more portals into Shornhelm.\n\nDid Verandis perhaps mention any suspicions of where this rat may have scurried off to?"
"3952276-0-5785";"Never mind that now. We must reach the Lightless Remnant and end this madness.\n\nTell the troops to remain here. They need to make sure none of Montclair's soldiers follow us up into the Doomcrag."

"3952276-0-5796";"Isn't it amazing how we all ask ourselves such questions? Really, it's all <<1>>'s fault.\n\nHe's my guide, or he was. I have no way of knowing where he could be now, but I was here to tour the ruins. That is why you're here, isn't it?"
"3952276-0-5797";"I sent three of my best scouts into <<1>> to answer that very question, but none returned.\n\nUntil I know their fates, I can't request reinforcements. But I won't send anyone else inside until I know what happened to my scouts. You see my predicament."

"3952276-0-5799";"A girl has to have a few secrets, doesn't she?\n\nMy master, Verandis Ravenwatch, asked me to find you. He'd like to talk to you at his estate, Ravenwatch Castle. It's west of Shornhelm, right outside the town of Crestshade."
"3952276-0-5800";"I am the most humble servant to the blessed goddess Almalexia. Her divine vision foresaw your coming, as in a dream.\n\nWe share a common enemy. That does not make us friends, but it does make us allies."
"3952276-0-5802";"I can see that. You didn't flinch when that vampire attacked.\n\nName's <<1>>. Me and my partners came here to hunt a certain Vampire Lord, but the infestation is worse than we thought. We could use someone like you."

"3952276-0-5992";"Bloody Argonians, that's what happened. A gang of mad lizards, hissing and spitting their crazy chants. They stole every flask of my stock and fled up to the cave on the hill. \n\nI'm a brave mer, I'll walk the Ashlands. But I'm not suicidal."
"3952276-0-5993";"Part of an ancient system of magical protections. Tormented Spire is a prison, the final rest for a beast out of legend. Normally these wards would be calm, pristine. As you can see, they are anything but."

"3952276-0-5995";"We're an advance crew for General Indoril. He and his son have some kind of ritual to perform and we need to make sure the area is secure. \n\nGeneral Holgunn could use another blade, I'm sure. He's heading the defense of Davon's Watch to the east."
"3952276-0-5996";"Not right now, I'm afraid. The leadership is waiting for something … special, though they're staying pretty mum about it.\n\nAll I know is that we're concentrating our forces at Vivec's Antlers at the moment."
"3952276-0-5997";"The Covenant. That's what's happened here. You've stumbled upon one of their many landing points in Stonefalls. Luckily though, we're on the case."
"3952276-0-5998";"Like I said, I was hunting. But now that the volcano's erupted, I'm headed to Deshaan. Don't want to get cooked. I'll be leaving as soon as my s'wit of a partner shows up.\n\nYou haven't run into an Argonian named Stands-In-Still-Water, have you?"
"3952276-0-5999";"My shoes? Let me think. I was walking along the shore, looking for mudcrabs, when a Hagraven tried to get frisky with me. Said she liked the cut of my toes. I told her no! I'm a married man! After that, my memory gets a bit fuzzy.\n\nOh no! My mace!"

"3952276-0-6980";"The skooma peddlers in Claw's Strike have a new mascot. The mush-brains somehow managed to train another bantam guar. I hear it dances on command.\n\nSo kill their leader and take the guar. I bet that will be a sharp kick to their spirits."

"3952276-0-7616";"I do.\n\nOne of your native companions warned you off of it, didn't they? Believe me, I sympathize. But despite my lifestyle, I'm still an Argonian—one with ample means. Who would I be if I didn't use that wealth to help my people?"
"3952276-0-7617";"Depends on the source, but all the legends indicate that the skull contains powerful magic. Not to mention a curse that could destroy Murkmire. I shudder at the very notion of someone like Margus or the Blackguards getting their hands on it!"
"3952276-0-7618";"She didn't say, and I didn't ask.\n\nIt's probably got something to do with this Remnant you're all so excited about. Frankly, I don't care. She wanted you to get the message and I delivered it."
"3952276-0-7619";"Very well, but someone needs to send word of Kassandra's treachery back to Lilmoth and the tribal villages. If she unleashes some ancient power, all should be prepared.\n\nI move swiftly in the rivers. I will find you again once I am finished."
"3952276-0-7620";"Well, I should tell you, we've officially left the realm of verified research, and entered the world of legend and wild-eyed conjecture.\n\nIf that last ruin was Xul-Thuxis, then this next xanmeer must be Vakka-Bok—the Bowl of the Sun, I think."
"3952276-0-7621";"Touching the Remnant, I can hear their voices. Old, like stone and willow roots. The souls inside are confused. They escaped the Ayleids, but then … a life in amber.\n\nThe Hist kept them safe inside—but it was never meant to last this long …."
"3952276-0-7622";"Oh, the most worthy kind of expedition—a journey into the distant past! Not the literal past, I mean. That would be crazy.\n\nWe're exploring one of the Argonians' ancient xanmeer pyramids to find a priceless relic: the Kajin-Jat Crystal!"
"3952276-0-7625";"Got a lead on some ancient Argonian texts preserved at the Teeth of Sithis. Problem is, the temple got overrun by Blackguards recently. Whatever those scum are doing there, it won't involve keeping old tablets from crumbling to dust."

"3952276-0-7630";"You really don't know, do you? Huh. I assumed Quintus neglected to tell me that he let this location slip during one of his fool binges, or soliciting a patron to fund his next expedition.\n\nHowever you got here, I have an offer for you."
"3952276-0-7632";"The Depths of Malatar. A sunken ruin filled with Meridia's eternal Purified. Slaves to her command, cleansed of disease, death, and free will. \n\nNot a bad deal, minus the last part. I'll leave it to you to find a way to kill the undying."
"3952276-0-7633";"Cyrodilic Collections relies on the generosity of benefactors to fund our expeditions. In return, we sometimes take on odd jobs related to historic inquiries and antiquities.\n\nTake Tia Doran, for example. She needs someone to enter Tsofeer Cavern."

"3952276-0-7635";"Our agents in Murkmire are always in danger of being bitten by some gross snake or spiky snail. We need to supply them with reliable curatives. Luckily, I know a brilliant Wood Elf alchemist named Mindileth. She makes a really good-good anti-venom!"

"3952276-0-7637";"We have a problem. Bugs.\n\nYou see, the air in my homeland is often thick with swarms of biting insects. Luckily, I have made contact with a candlemaker named Tamira Dobar. Her products are guaranteed to keep even the largest bugs at bay!"
"3952276-0-7638";"The bonding ritual is very important to the tribe. Everyone is under a lot of pressure to make sure everything is perfect.\n\nThere's some commotion in the village right now. Raised voices, tempers high. Not the best time for visitors."
"3952276-0-7639";"It is my home, you see, and I have just returned from Shadowfen. I have supplies meant for our bonding ritual preparations, but I must arrange for their transport. It would mean so much if you could tell my tree-minder that I will be home soon."
"3952276-0-7640";"The grove is north of Alten Meerhleel—tucked away near a roaring waterfall, if memory serves.\n\nI will make my personal ferry available to all here assembled. Join us. Or walk, if you prefer. I'd only ask that you avoid any unnecessary delays."
"3952276-0-7641";"Gathering food in Murkmire is a dangerous proposition, even for Argonians. To keep our explorers robust, we have to ship in hearty food—salted meat mostly. It does not rot so easily in the dampness of the swamp. Our supply is short, however."
"3952276-0-7642";"As you may know, the weather in Murkmire can be nastier than a crocodile's bite. The last storm to hit our expedition set us back an entire week!\n\nWe need an ally who can help us prepare, and that's a fact."
"3952276-0-7644";"My homeland is very beautiful, but also very dangerous. Knifeberries, toadskin peppers, ghost truffles … these foods look very fine, but will kill most anyone who eats them. Without a guide, explorers can easily starve in the marsh."
"3952276-0-7645";"Cyrodilic Collections can't outfit our expeditions without the generous donations of benefactors. In return, we sometimes perform services for these benefactors. Services related to historic investigation and research.\n\nFor example, take Tia Doran."
"3952276-0-7646";"Increased business for me, extra gold for you! I believe the Imperials call it a win-win situation.\n\nThe prominent trader, Captain Jimila, arrived in port. If we can convince her to export my vossa-satls, the possibilities for profit are endless!"
"3952276-0-7648";"Kassandra wants to see you at the Cyrodilic Collections headquarters. Now.\n\nThat little tea party Famia's hosting won't last much longer. They want to get going to the Swallowed Grove."
"3952276-0-7649";"It's my missing companions, Eshraf and Dinia—the explorers whose bags we found out in the marsh. Remember?\n\nI told you I sent them to recover vakka stones, but that wasn't all they were looking for. They were looking for the Remnant of Argon."
"3952276-0-7650";"Zadaza does not know all the details. She was busy bathing and counting her xanmeer treasures when Famia urged her to find you.\n\nSomething about other explorers going missing, I think? You should talk to her. She waits for you in her office."

"3952276-0-7652";"Cyrodilic Collections needs someone to gather old remains from the Teeth of Sithis. Something about a theory and live sacrifices. I didn't ask. All you need to do is poke around the xanmeers and bring back anything that might have walked on two legs."
"3952276-0-7653";"Truly? Then perhaps you'd be willing to help!\n\nMy boss Seeks-the-Dark has been captured by these ruffians. And as tempting as a daring rescue sounds, there's no way I could possibly infiltrate Blackrose Prison alone."

"3952276-0-7661";"Is-is it that obvious? Yes, I am … well, no. Not really.\n\nI've come to ask Sulahkeesh, a former agent of the Shadowscales, to help arbitrate a dispute. But speaking to an assassin, even a retired one, is a … terrifying prospect, to say the least."
"3952276-0-7662";"A plain wooden box, the length of my forearm.\n\nLast I saw, it was nestled in the beak of one of the hackwings that attacked me. I believe it may have brought the box back to its nest, just north-west of this dock."
"3952276-0-7663";"Danlai was skinned alive. Whoever did that to him wanted to send a message. They left his body on display. He was not dead when we found him, but there was nothing we could do other than wet his tongue before the end."

"3952276-0-7666";"No—well, for a moment there—I was practicing my swamp jelly calls when I saw you passing by. It takes just the right amount of saliva to get their tenor.\n\nI'll have to work up another mouthful, but there'll be time for that now that you're here!"
"3952276-0-7667";"An antique Argonian renewal charm. Without one, they'll never let me observe the ritual of renewal. And that's the whole reason I came to this backwater in the first place.\n\nNow if only Stibbons would stop playing in the mud and find the damn thing."
"3952276-0-7668";"We are amidst the preparations for our tribe's most vital ceremony. Now a warped and withered stranger has died at our roots. An ill omen for the arrival of our guests.\n\nI am troubled, ojel, because I do not hear what the Hist is trying to tell me."

"3952276-0-7681";"I believe so. There's an artifact mentioned in Ayleid records from the same time period bearing a lot of similarities to the tablet we discovered in the Vault of Mhuvnak. Lost with the fall of their empire and found by the Empire that conquered them."

"3952276-0-7692";"Ugh. I am sorry. Numaia grows suspicious of everyone these days.\n\nA Dragon swept through recently, you see? Gobbled up whole herds of antelope and burned out the larger hunting camps. Now, Bonechime poachers pitch their tents all over the Prowl."
"3952276-0-7693";"We were exploring the nearby oasis caverns when the fumes first began to spread.\n\nOnly Najirra and I were able to escape. The rest of my companions, weakened and disoriented by the poisoned air, ran farther into the caverns of the oasis."

"3952276-0-7697";"I know how a horn works, five-claw, but this is a relic of ancient magic. I do not want to damage it before we learn the true significance of its power. I will have Tharn do more research.\n\nIn the meantime, we have another matter to deal with."
"3952276-0-7698";"A few years ago, my deplorable sibling broke protocol and conquered a portion of Elsweyr. I assume she wants the weapon to secure her territory and increase the size of her holdings.\n\nEuraxia's ruthlessness is exceeded only by her ambition."

"3952276-0-7759";"Yes, walker! Divine Alkosh has returned to this perch to call the Khajiit who have strayed back to him! Though any who hear his word and obey are welcome here."
"3952276-0-7760";"<Teeth from the false Alkosh lay strewn about from from our battle. I should take them to Bishop Azin-jo as proof of the heretic Dragon's defeat.>"

"3952276-0-7764";"My shiny ancestor here. We got along fine when he was ashes in an urn, but something stirred his spirit, and now he won't leave me alone. He says Saviwa spends too much time drinking and napping. As if there's something better to spend time on."
"3952276-0-7765";"As you can see, I put together a proper expedition this time, including a translator who was supposed to secure us safe passage through Goblin territory. He's made little headway, so it's your turn to clear our path to Frostvault."
"3952276-0-7766";"Some, but not a lot. Luckily, we anticipated the connection to the Moon Gate and sent Gharesh-ri ahead with whatever forces we could spare—which was not as much as I would like. \n\nI just wish we had something else to fall back on."
"3952276-0-7767";"Nisuzi's clan often travels by lantern-light. Easier to avoid robbers and pesky guards at night, yes?\n\nIn the past, we fueled our lamps with oil from Darkpool Mine—a cavern to the southwest. But now, we must give it a wide berth."
"3952276-0-7769";"Yes, but Gharesh-ri's scouts report that they're on their way. Our parley seems to have aroused Euraxia's anger.\n\nWhat remains of Elsweyr's militia has taken up positions around town, but I fear they are too few in number. They need your help."
"3952276-0-7770";"I'm glad you wish to help. We need valiant folk to slow down the spread of Dragons.\n\nIt is regrettable enough that they're causing suffering here. Let's try to prevent that from happening outside Elsweyr, as well."
"3952276-0-7771";"Abnur Tharn demands your presence in the war council. You know, K'har Zhab Hall. In Riverhold. \n\nTrouble is coming, five-claw. This one can feel it in her tail!"
"3952276-0-7772";"Everything is wrong! My friend Marthine entered this flu-ridden city to recruit followers for Peryite, but he hasn't returned. I fear the diseased beasts inside have devoured him like a massive scab.\n\nPlease tell me you can help."
"3952276-0-7773";"Now, this one isn't supposed to know such things, but what kind of spy would Lyrrsazhi be if she didn't stick her nose in council business from time to time?\n\nThis one heard the Speaker and the Tharn. They discussed a direct assault on Rimmen."
"3952276-0-7774";"It concerns Euraxia's soldiers. Nisuzi's cousin, Hatha, says that many of these unclawed, soft-headed brutes gather in the Desert Wind Caverns.\n\nThey mean to pick the place clean—to claim all our people's wisdom. For them, nothing is sacred!"
"3952276-0-7775";"Baan Dar teaches us to be clever and swift, but wise most of all. Wisdom means foresight, yes? And no one peers into the future like a Baandari soothsayer.\n\nThe Moons have much to tell us, but we need bijous and talismans to hear their truth."
"3952276-0-7776";"Hmm. You will think us superstitious. Maybe you are superstitious, too?\n\nWe give thanks to Baan Dar for our quick wits and swiftness, but sometimes, strong claws and sharp senses serve us better. For those things, we call on the Hungry Cat. Hircine."
"3952276-0-7777";"Musty old crypts do not frighten you, do they? No no no, of course not!\n\nWe need a five-clawed warrior to settle some business in the Tomb of the Serpents. Nisuzi's clan often plucks Akaviri snake-man relics from this tomb. Good for trading, you see?"
"3952276-0-7778";"We Baandari indulge in many passions, walker. Song, dancing, sweet foods, stories …. But a cup of strong tea makes all these things better, yes?\n\nNisuzi knows a place called the Tangle, where precious tea shrubs grow thick as senche manes!"
"3952276-0-7780";"No, no I jumped out.\n\nSay, I know this is a little sudden, but are you looking to make a bit of gold? Meet me at the Sugar Bowl here in Rimmen. Got some business that might interest you."
"3952276-0-7781";"Just so, sleek one, just so. You walk tall, with the heavy footfalls that signify an abundance of pride and gold.\n\nUnless you wish to keep low and beneath notice, like Humble Zaham, there is a price to be paid. Willingly or not."
"3952276-0-7783";"Oh, not this one, five-claw. Lyrrsazhi is only the messenger. A sad state of affairs for a master spy, but we must do what we must do.\n\nQueen Khamira requests your presence in Rimmen Palace. What a wonder, a Khajiit once again on the Anequina throne!"
"3952276-0-7786";"""This voucher provides the bearer with one cake for special occasions from the renowned baker, Chef Donolon."""
"3952276-0-7787";"Well, to be specific, Lyrrsazhi was told to watch for you exactly. To deliver a message.\n\nThe fragrant Abnur Tharn demands your presence in the war council. You know, Riverhold's K'har Zhab Hall. Trouble is coming. This one can feel it in her tail!"
"3952276-0-7788";"Lyrrsazhi has a message for you, five-claw. Queen Khamira wants you to attend her in Rimmen Palace immediately.\n\nNow, this one isn't certain of all the details, but she heard something about a Dragonhorn. You discovered that, didn't you?"
"3952276-0-7789";"As soon as Rigurt returned home from successful diplomatic endeavoring, the Skald-King sent him to Elsweyr with gifts for the cats. Rigurt is always given the most important, most far away missions.\n\nProblem is, Rigurt lost the gifts."
"3952276-0-7790";"What does Sheogorath always want? I am the Mad Star! The Mad God! Ironically, I'm actually quite happy.\n\nBut I'm neither here nor anywhere. All that matters at the moment is infusing some entertainment into this dreadfully dull bloodshed."
"3952276-0-7791";"Hadamnargo prefers to remain positive, so he thinks of it as more of a pest opportunity. Wasps are nesting in his fields, but he can't get rid of them because he's busy consoling his horse over our lost guar, Gordon.\n\nThis is a very sensitive horse."
"3952276-0-7793";"Yeah. A Goutfang master fled an adeptorium, taking scrolls. The Khajiit want the scrolls back. Badly. They also want this pariah, as they call the master, dead.\n\nIf you find out what this pariah did, let me know."
"3952276-0-7794";"An insufferable Akaviri swordmistress, Vhysradue, planted her flag on the Hill of Shattered Swords about a century back. We thought she'd pass of old age eventually, but she's still up there, gloating and spitting challenges at anyone who wanders by."
"3952276-0-7795";"Yes, walker. A terror bird needs killing.\n\nThe Baandari call her Wily Kee'va, on account of her cleverness. Old Ri'hirr likes his birds slow and stupid. Kee'va, unfortunately, is neither. Now she's taken to thieving—rustling camels near Scar's End."
"3952276-0-7796";"The message is short and to the point. Queen Khamira requires your presence at Rimmen Palace, posthaste.\n\nOf course, Lyrrsazhi can elaborate, provided you are interested."
"3952276-0-7797";"Old Ri'hirr hears tell that an ancient dro-m'Athra named Zalsheem reappeared in the Hidden Moon shrine near Predator Mesa.\n\nA handful of Twilight Cantors banished her centuries ago, but evil spirits like Zalsheem never stay gone for long."

"3952276-0-7800";"Many Khajiit have a … loose definition of what is legal and what is not. Old Ri'hirr included! But some take it too far.\n\nTake these two: Zav'i and Akumjhargo. They lead a pride of bandits out of Red Hands Run. Muskarsed villains, both of them!"
"3952276-0-7801";"It's more about what was not said than what was, yes? For example, the queen said nothing about how the Mane sent an envoy to determine if she is really the heir of Anequina.\n\nAbout the Dragons and the strange eclipse, she has been equally silent."
"3952276-0-7802";"A necromancer called Thannar the Graveprowler reappeared recently, just southwest of here at Scar's Edge.\n\nDon't expect to find some scrawny, dull-fanged wizard, rhook. Thannar is a Senche-raht—as big and as dangerous as they come."
"3952276-0-7804";"I am grateful that you wish to help. We could use assistance stopping the spread of Dragons beyond Elsweyr. Optimally, we want to stop them altogether, so any effort you can throw into this goal would be appreciated."
"3952276-0-7808";"This one saw a stranger setting up camp outside the cave nearby.\n\nLocal legend says that Mafala-worshipers used to lurk there. Risen dead too, I think. To venture so close to such a place …. It does not seem wise."
"3952276-0-7809";"The Ruddy Fangs are the biggest bandit pride this side of the Scar. And probably south of the Scar too. This bunch has been preying on refugees fleeing the Dragons. As if they haven't lost enough.\n\nShook me down too, bastards."

"3952276-0-7826";"A Dragon nests on a nearby island. I believe it plans to attack Senchal. We need to slay the creature before it strikes.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not a ship in this city that will sail us to a Dragon's lair. Believe me, I've asked."
"3952276-0-7828";"Murder, terror, you know what I mean!\n\nA whole flock of them knocked over a caravan down the road. Like kicking over an anthill, see? Boxes and carts are all wrecked. It's a mess! Then again, there might be some shinies scattered about. Never know."
"3952276-0-7829";"Oh, this one was just …. Ugh, I will not fib. Daini meant to rob this caravan. Do not judge! I swear on the Moons I did not … this was an accident! Even if it was not, those muskarses were slavers, killers, and worse!\n\nDull-witted terror birds!"
"3952276-0-7830";"He returned shortly after we did, but he's been acting strangely. He won't talk to me. Won't tell me what happened up there after Abnur ….\n\nHe trusts you. Can you check on him for me?"
"3952276-0-7831";"Sidura is just the look-out. This messenger stuff requires memorizing more information than this one cares to keep in her head all at once.\n\nJust return to the Dragonguard Sanctum. The bearded one wants to have words with you, yes?"
"3952276-0-7832";"Nahfahlaar might. He's dealt with Laatvulon in the past and may have a better understanding of the cult's motives. Why don't you talk with our Dragon ally?\n\nMeanwhile, I'll rally the rest of our companions and head to Pridehome."

"3952276-0-7835";"Bit of treasure hunting. There's a little snippet in this book about the terms of the Akaviri surrender at Pale Pass. One of the concessions was offering the Akaviri war dead proper burial. Problem is, by that time there were a lot of hasty graves."

"3952276-0-7838";"I do. The crew of the Perfect Pounce already helped us on one Dragon hunt. I'd like you to see if they'd join us for many more.\n\nSpeak to Za'ji and see if he and his crew want to join our order."
"3952276-0-7841";"Yes! Sacrilegious smugglers and sugar-tooths! They came in their skiffs and turned our sacred shrines into skooma stills! Now the waters stink of their scummy stock.\n\nShaveskins, the lot of them!"

"3952276-0-7844";"The Sea of Ghosts doesn't suffer fools. Never has. But now, some dark magic's driven it mad! Great gales whip around this island, breaking masts like kindling-wood and drowning sailors by the dozens.\n\nHigh King Jorunn sent us to investigate."

"3952276-0-7849";"The Unhallowed Grave. Way I hear it, a band of good-for-nothing graverobbers and necromancers called the Draugrkin descended on the place. Scooping up bones and ash, for some reason.\n\nI wager those rascals will provide a fair challenge."
"3952276-0-7850";"Honestly? No. Far from it. I find myself plagued by unsettling dreams.\n\nEvery night since my mother died, my mind returns to this place. I see a man scribbling a letter. I hold my mother's necklace out to him. His eyes turn to me, then I wake."

"3952276-0-7854";"And I'm recruiting people who need work. Happy coincidence, yeah?\n\nA rogue Goutfang and his students waylaid one of our supply caravans. Took a bunch of rice. We need that rice. We also need that group of adepts dead."
"3952276-0-7855";"Yeah, I do. I have a territorial Meridian guardian that needs killing. Some folk also need temple dust, which, coincidentally, the guardian protects."
"3952276-0-7856";"Lucky for us, I have work. It's tough, but it pays well.\n\nBasically, a scholar decided to study a temple. Ran astray of a guardian. Now we want that guardian dead. Oh, and the scholar's friends want any notes you can find."
"3952276-0-7857";"Yeah. A supply wagon driver, in their infinite wisdom, ignored our scouts' advice and took a shortcut through a guarded temple. We're short arrows now.\n\nI need people who can destroy the guardian and retrieve some of our arrows."

"3952276-0-7897";"Adara'hai came to support her sister through a trying ordeal. Ka'ishka's husband has been ill for a very long time. Adara'hai knew she needed help from her letter, but this one didn't think she meant an exorcism.\n\nIt seems she was mistaken."
"3952276-0-7898";"He wants you to infiltrate that Dragon cult that's been mucking up our plans. Seems they're recruiting in Senchal!\n\nGo speak to Sai Sahan right away. He's waiting for you."
"3952276-0-7899";"Apparently he has a Dragon friend he wants us to recruit. Though if you ask Sidura, one Dragon in the sanctum is more than enough.\n\nNahfahlaar needs your helping finding the beast, so he wants to speak with you."
"3952276-0-7901";"The Gray Host? Where have I heard that name?\n\nMeanwhile, my father rounded up the harrowed and moved his soldiers to the outer walls. Then he ordered the quartermaster to stockpile Castle Dour. He's preparing Solitude to withstand a long siege."
"3952276-0-7902";"Who? Give me a moment … oh! Ha! It was you. Svana wants to see you. At the Blue Palace, of all places.\n\nWhy? I have no idea, but there you have it."
"3952276-0-7904";"I'm part of the crew from the merchant ship Silver Cormorant. The snows … overtook us. Trapped us in the ice. Now, our shipmates are missing, and we're out of food. I went looking for both.\n\nPlease. I can't go on. The frost will take my toes soon."
"3952276-0-7905";"Yes, apparently so. Wolf packs sometimes migrate through the outskirts of Morthal. Occasionally they will attack a lone merchant traveling the road after dark. Easy prey for them, perhaps.\n\nBut now a pack targeted some farmhands. Curious."
"3952276-0-7906";"There's a sickness spreading here. It's only affected werewolves so far. Those that fall ill quickly become aggressive. Crazed.\n\nWe were close to finding a cure, but our alchemist, Rasir, went missing. I fear something terrible happened to him."
"3952276-0-7907";"My father hasn't heard a word I've said since I was old enough to talk. But with mother gone, someone has to make him see reason.\n\nYou know, she tried to teach me, but I never listened. I guess maybe I'm more like my father than I care to admit."
"3952276-0-7908";"Answers, I hope. That's what Jorunn the Skald-King sent me to find, after all.\n\nThe witches of the Icereach Coven are definitely up to something, luring unsuspecting folk with promises of wealth. We saw what happened at those ritual sites."
"3952276-0-7909";"Abnur Tharn. According to his letter, the two of you worked together after the Planemeld debacle. He even praised you. Didn't think Tharn was capable of such a thing.\n\nThe old snake said he's bringing a friend along to discuss important business."
"3952276-0-7912";"We were bound for Solitude when this ice storm came out of nowhere. The Silver Cormorant was ice locked before we knew what was happening. \n\nTrip was supposed to be easy. We weren't prepared for a delay. We're completely out of food."
"3952276-0-7913";"You're right. I know you're right. It's just—he's my father!\n\nNo, I have to focus. There's a harrowstorm coming. We have to save the city. That's what's important right now."
"3952276-0-7914";"Tusk if I know. I heard that something sordid occurred at the palace, but she wouldn't give me any details.\n\nSomething to do with the high king. She did mention an impending doom, though. Hence, my suddenly sober outlook."
"3952276-0-7915";"A storm exploded above our temple, but it was unlike any weather ever seen in Skyrim. It raged like a thing alive, hungry and violent.\n\nI gathered who I could and led them to this cave, but the others are still out there. They need our help."
"3952276-0-7916";"Unfortunately, we've only recovered a few of the medallions. And Magister Fridelja hasn't determined what enchantment the medallions use to provide their protection.\n\nWe need another solution."
"3952276-0-7918";"Information. The Icereach Coven … at work in the west. Just need more proof.\n\nGo! They're coming."
"3952276-0-7919";"Not right now. Other members of the Ravenwatch came here ahead of me. They'll be interested in the vampire we saw and I need to get word to them.\n\nBesides, I want to follow the trail while it's fresh. So, it only makes sense that you warn Solitude."
"3952276-0-7920";"A storm straight out of Mauloch's guts rose up as I returned from patrol. It twisted everyone I know into monsters.\n\nIn the chaos, I saw my brother Hafskjar and his friend Bjora take people to the barrow west of town. But I've heard nothing since."
"3952276-0-7921";"The Bards College, of course. We who pluck heartstrings and chill the blood. \n\nYears ago, our prized antique instruments were, uh, borrowed by an overzealous member. She meant to heal a rift within the college, but it only made things worse."
"3952276-0-7923";"Uh … look up. It's hard to miss.\n\nLady Essenia, the Blood Queen, holds court inside. Or at least she did. Apparently, she bent the knee to some ancient vampire from the west. She's called on every vampire in Skyrim to join her here and do likewise."
"3952276-0-7924";"Spirits, of course! Ideally, the ones that have been terrorizing these poor people.\n\nMy mentor, Claudina, and I are supernatural specialists. We've been given the important responsibility of investigating Blackreach's disappearing miners."
"3952276-0-7925";"Oh, we eventually find the wagons—ransacked, ruined, and no sign of the traders.\n\nAll I can say for sure is that without a safe and constant supply line, the Dragon Bridge garrison will collapse. And that will leave the entire region in jeopardy."
"3952276-0-7928";"Got into a tangle with a spriggan in the Shadowgreen. Think it wanted to take root in my guts. I'll live, provided I can get off this mountain before it explodes.\n\nFriendly word of warning: the mountain's going to explode."
"3952276-0-7929";"I am now, I think. I was part of a larger group heading into Greymoor Keep. Lady Essenia — she was looking for some help. Promised good pay.\n\nBut as soon as we stepped in the gates, we were attacked. They dragged away the others and I … I ran."
"3952276-0-7930";"Mainly one ghost, honestly. A distant ancestor. Every time I try to sleep he's in my dreams. I've barely had an hour's rest since I came to Dusktown. It's going to kill me, if it doesn't drive me mad first. He's been calling me here, I think."
"3952276-0-7931";"The queen seemed reasonable. She'll believe us. As for Svargrim, who can tell? I haven't met the man, but everything I've heard describes him as prideful, arrogant, and hard-headed.\n\nEven with the queen's help, there's no guarantee."
"3952276-0-7933";"Good question. This is the third time this month it's happened. We always find the wagons eventually, but stripped clean of our supplies and the caravaneers run off. \n\nIt's really taking a toll on the garrison. We can't function like this."
"3952276-0-7937";"Not officially … at least I don't think so. I feel like the whole world's crumbling around me. But the city's still standing, so that's something.\n\nI'm more worried about our friends. We left Lyris and Fenn to hold off a horde of harrowfiends."
"3952276-0-7938";"How should I know. She's just staring out over the city like some kind of gargoyle. She could use someone to talk to, I think.\n\nThat's not me anymore."
"3952276-0-7939";"Viggol reached seventy-three years old last month, but still thinks he can adventure like he's twenty! He heard rumors about strange creatures picking off miners down here, so he and Pickle set out to kill a few for old times' sake."
"3952276-0-7941";"You did it! Just look at them all—on display and waiting to be played. Maestro Nel would be happy to see them back, I think.\n\nNo more reveries! We must celebrate this historic occasion. It is time for a salskap!"
"3952276-0-7943";"When the mine collapsed, creatures attacked from below. Thulsgreg and his wife, Mazog, locked the door to keep the beasts contained, then Mazog hid the key.\n\nWe need to get in there, but making either of them see reason has proven … difficult."
"3952276-0-7944";"Yeah. I don't know all the details. Just heard a loud rumble and miners scrambling out of the mine shouting and coughing.\n\nWay I hear it, some workers are still trapped inside. Not sure what the chief plans to do about it, honestly. Ugly business."
"3952276-0-7945";"It's overrun with mindless beasts! An enormous storm appeared over the town as I came up the road. When I got there, it was chaos. Monsters attacking any who still lived. I barely escaped with my life."

"3952276-0-7953";"I'm a humble healer from Dragon Bridge. My family—my brother, my sister, and I—we came to gather plants and other medicinal ingredients. \n\nHedrynne wandered too close to this cave. That's when the chaurus attacked her."
"3952276-0-7954";"A temple dedicated to Meridia, the Lady of Light. Pilgrims come from across Skyrim to pray and seek blessings, especially at this time of the year.\n\nPlease, talk to Priest Bavian. You'll find her in the nearby cave, tending to the injured."
"3952276-0-7956";"This task is part of my own alchemical research, and something of my own creation. I believe it will make for an interesting study!\n\nI've formulated a Tonic of Giant Strength that's nearly ready to test. All it needs is a finishing touch!"
"3952276-0-7957";"The esteemed Goblin-scholar Landal Gevont has commissioned the Coterie to seek evidence of a previously undiscovered tribe living within Chillwind Depths. \n\nAs you'd imagine, the Coterie is eager to substantiate this claim."
"3952276-0-7958";"You should enjoy this. It's a fascinating study! \n\nOne of our scholars is doing research for a treatise on ancient Nord embalming practices, specifically how they might help to improve modern healing techniques. He needs help acquiring samples."
"3952276-0-7959";"You don't know? Some kind of disease has spread throughout Blackreach. It's turning werewolves mad … feral, almost. And our only hope to find a cure vanished without a trace."
"3952276-0-7960";"Yeah, well, they're long gone—across the water—and my Nelfthea with them. She should have just run off with me. We'd have scraped by without more of their dirty money.\n\nDon't know why she's so loyal. After all they've made us do."
"3952276-0-7961";"Raynor and I got hired by the local mining consortium to investigate this Dwarven vault, Nchuthnkarst. Raynor jumped on it. Said something about this place unlocking secrets about Dwarven tonal architecture.\n\nBut it's more trouble than it's worth."
"3952276-0-7962";"A comfortable seat, a flagon of bog-iron ale, some lively company. Instead, I'm a messenger for her royal highness. Svana wants to see you. She's at the Blue Palace rubbing shoulders with the jarls.\n\nAh, I could also use a shoulder rub."
"3952276-0-7963";"These damnable cultists bested me! The witless fools believe they can summon a Dragon and return the Dragon Cult to prominence. Ha! \n\nOne of their mages bound my soul to this doll and left me to spend eternity as this repulsively adorable plaything."
"3952276-0-7964";"Why indeed? Svana wishes to speak with you in the Lonely Troll and she's banished me from the place until I find you!\n\nShe's been terribly depressed since the events at the palace. Even refuses to drink with me, if you can imagine such a thing!"
"3952276-0-7965";"Indeed! I was conducting an ambitious experiment when my tools gave out.\n\nSomeone or something ransacked this ruin some time ago, but I believe valuable power nodes and a master scepter still exist within. Perhaps you'd like to help me acquire them?"
"3952276-0-7966";"Yes … he used to visit these ruins, once or twice a year, on what he said were academic pilgrimages. He would be gone for a few days, then return looking tired but satisfied.\n\nIt's been three weeks since we saw him last."
"3952276-0-7967";"Blackreach isn't for the faint of heart. When we first came down here, we lost people to animal attacks. That's gotten better, but now everyone's spooked about a few missing miners.\n\nMost don't realize it's not uncommon for workers to wander off."
"3952276-0-7968";"Skald-King sent Rigurt to Western Skyrim for an important mission: to talk to Thane Hraldi and Thane Svyne about a peace treaty with Windhelm.\n\nHelping Rigurt meet them is Jarl Morryn of Whiterun, Skyrim's greatest diplomat! After Rigurt, of course."
"3952276-0-7971";"Aye. A blood-drinking beast. A fiend of ice and fog.\n\nThe sea's been rough for days, you see. Bitter winds, cold rain that rakes at the eyes and clings to your beard. Thought it was just foul weather. But then we saw Lord Falgravn's longships."
"3952276-0-7972";"<A vile, bat-shaped amulet hangs loose around Lord Falgravn's throat. I should deliver it to Thane Ogvar as proof of the vampire's defeat.>"
"3952276-0-7973";"<A blood-stained chalice clattered to the floor as Lord Falgravn fell. I should deliver this ghastly cup to Thane Ogvar as proof of the vampire's defeat.>"
"3952276-0-7974";"Like I said, a fleet of Sea Giants and vampires stormed the island, bent on slaughter. Our soldiers fought bravely, but the invaders pushed the last of our troops back to the keep. They'll land the decisive blow any minute!\n\nWe need help!"
"3952276-0-7975";"That's what they're saying down at the tavern. Ghosts appearing from snow storms. Undead attacks on the road. Just as I left, a group of farmers came into town shouting about skeleton wolves. These woods are cursed!"
"3952276-0-7976";"Hey. Rude. I asked first. Whatever. I happen to be in search of some lunatic alchemist named Arkasis who's working on some mad scheme with some equally crazy co-conspirators.\n\nHis laboratory is near here. I can smell it."
"3952276-0-7978";"The Stone Garden. A derelict Dwemer ruin buried deep underground. Rumor has it that it's now the laboratory of a deranged alchemist who's dipped into his stock one too many times. Find it and smash whatever madness he's up to."
"3952276-0-7979";"I could ask the same of you. But I don't really care.\n\nThe ruler of this castle, one Lady Thorn, apparently decided to start amassing her own vampiric army. Bad move on her part. I want to know what she's planning, and then stop it."
"3952276-0-7981";"Castle Thorn. Some dusty old fortress tucked away in the hills of Western Skyrim. The vampire that rules the place used to keep to herself. But now we hear she built an army to start some trouble.\n\nWell, if that's what she wants, go give it to her."
"3952276-0-7982";"I need a Giant slayer. And not just any Giant, a Sea Giant. Made landfall just today and promptly slaughtered a patrol of the king's soldiers on the coast, save for the one who brought us word."
"3952276-0-7983";"Lyris Titanborn reminds you that the Skald-King's business hasn't been concluded. The plans of the Icereach Coven remain a mystery.\n\nBut I understand that the two of you discovered something important in the Ratway."
"3952276-0-7985";"Princess Svana, of course. Her father still refuses to act, so the princess has decided to take matters into her own hands.\n\nLuckily, she has my darling Fennorian to assist her. He has a plan for dealing with the harrowstorms, I hear."
"3952276-0-7986";"What do you think? The princess just learned that her father is an evil vampire and he's about to unleash a harrowstorm on Solitude! She needs to figure out how to stop him—and she needs your help to do it!"
"3952276-0-7987";"Solitude has been through much. Now is the time to heal and rebuild. But they can't do it alone. They need Princess Svana.\n\nAnd Princess Svana needs your counsel."
"3952276-0-7990";"Dark clouds are gathering over the western kingdom. Harrowstorms, they're called. The conjurings of Reachmen witchcraft.\n\nUnfortunately, there are more reports of these unholy storms than folk willing to brave them."
"3952276-0-7991";"A lifetime of failure. For thirty years, I've hunted my brother's killer. Tracked it all across Skyrim, seeking justice. Somehow, it always managed to vanish.\n\nTell me, have you heard any stories of a monster called the Pale Man?"
"3952276-0-7992";"The University of Gwylim's most prestigious historical society. We scour the continent for lost antiquities, collecting and cataloging as we go.\n\nWe've made hundreds of discoveries, thanks in no small part to our scrying tool—the Antiquarian's Eye."
"3952276-0-7993";"Wow, really? That's uncharacteristically gracious of her. Huh. Well anyway, let's get started.\n\nIt all begins with concentration. The Eye wants to show you what you seek. So, clear your thoughts and conjure up a picture of the relic in your mind."
"3952276-0-7994";"Fennorian asked me to keep my eyes and ears open. He wants me to pass along news and messages between here and the surface.\n\nI ran into the most interesting Orc on my last visit to Solitude. He was looking for you on behalf of Princess Svana."
"3952276-0-7995";"I have no idea. Reading other people's messages is rude and unladylike. I never engage in such actions!\n\nBut the princess had no such qualms about opening the letter. She said if I did happen to see you, that I was to send you to the Blue Palace."
"3952276-0-7997";"You've heard about Dragon Mounds, right? They're ancient Dragon burial sites. Centuries old, the Dragon War, the Dragon Cult —\n\nI'm overexplaining. The job is simple. I just need some charcoal rubbings from those mounds."
"3952276-0-7998";"A goatherd has been complaining about wolves preying on his goats for weeks. Normally, that wouldn't be of much concern, but the last volunteer we sent came back on his shield with his guts torn out. Turns out the goat snatchers are werewolves."
"3952276-0-7999";"The Orcs near Mor Khazgur hold tests of strength to find worthy leaders. The victors often go on to rule clans or lead armies.\n\nUnfortunately, the newest champion has been accused of cheating, and that's got the Orcs in an uproar."

"3952276-0-8001";"The Coterie of Organized Scholars made a troubling discovery. Turns out the old legends of the Shademother have more truth to them than anyone believed. Now it falls on us to put an end to the foul creature before it causes any more harm."
"3952276-0-8002";"Our senior most expert on ambulatory flora requires a field assistant to collect fresh samples of spriggan bark from the Shadowgreen."
"3952276-0-8005";"One of the Coterie's scholars has an obsession with the mysteries of Dwemer mechanisms, specifically the effects of harmonics upon soul-powered automatons. Sounds like a novel, doesn't it? Investigator Vale and the Mysteries of Dwemer Mechanisms."

"3952276-0-8009";"Downstairs poring over more maps and tomes, no doubt. Honestly, the girl never stops working. I'd almost think she was trying to make the rest of us look bad if she wasn't so confoundedly cheerful.\n\nAt any rate, she'll get you sorted."
"3952276-0-8010";"An explorer limped into town warning of a giant Dwarven colossus endlessly building upon itself somewhere far beneath the earth. I'd say let sleeping Dwarves lie, but the explorer believes the thing will only grow more large and dangerous with time."

"3952276-0-8020";"Stuck in the bottle? No, no, no. This is a devious and very stubborn illusion. One that you now have the privilege of breaking!\n\nI was conducting some research, you see, and inadvertently triggered this spell. Luckily, I know how to reverse it."

"3952276-0-8035";"Ah, the keystone. What is it and how is it connected to that Dwarven structure? Why are they so important to Rada and Lady Belain? Perhaps they seek to harness some sort of Dwarven sorcery?\n\nRegardless, we can't allow them to achieve their goal."
"3952276-0-8036";"Traditions passed down from our foremothers. Like the story of the Prophecy of the Dark Heart. It deals with souls. Shadows. Endings.\n\nI know the core of it, but Nathari understands the nuances. Unfortunately, we haven't spoken in a long, long time."
"3952276-0-8037";"You know the Ravenwatch is committed to dealing with these kinds of threats. I can't think of anything worse than a reborn army of vampires and werewolves from the First Era.\n\nSo, yes, I could use some help. We need to know more about their plans."
"3952276-0-8040";"The Ravenwatch is dedicated to curtailing the activities of unscrupulous vampires, and the Gray Host is as unscrupulous as they come!\n\nSomeone is rebuilding the ancient army of vampires and werewolves that ravaged the First Era. We need to stop them."
"3952276-0-8041";"Ard Caddach. He rules the Reach from Understone Keep in Markarth. \n\nI've come to offer my help against the Gray Host, but he has turned me away time and time again. Meanwhile, even here, in the shadow of the city, the Gray Host plots and conspires."
"3952276-0-8042";"With your warning, Ard Caddach can decide what to do with Lady Belain's advice in the future. As to why they care that Reachfolk gather within the city, I'll need to think about that.\n\nDid you hear anything else of significance during their exchange?"
"3952276-0-8043";"That, I have yet to determine. But consider what he's wrought thus far—harrowstorms across Western Skyrim to revive the Gray Host. Here, the souls of Markarth reaped to empower the Dark Heart. Both great sacrifices, but I fear worse is yet to come."
"3952276-0-8044";"What else? That's all he seems to think about lately, but he hasn't shared any details.\n\nI hope whatever it is takes some weight off his shoulders. He hasn't been the same since what happened at the Library of Arkthzand."
"3952276-0-8046";"Look, I'm no scholar. I barely believe in this stuff and I hardly understand it. But the Void is the place outside the places. The darkness beyond Mundus and Oblivion.\n\nAnyway, Verandis felt a change in the currents. He sent me to get you."
"3952276-0-8047";"We follow the map! We'll take the cart to Shornhelm's coast, hire a ship, and sail to the spot indicated on the back of the letter. \n\nFingers crossed, we'll be there faster than you can say gorapple pie."
"3952276-0-8048";"We follow the map! We travel to the coast, hire a ship, and sail to the spot indicated on the back of the letter you found. The one from Rada al-Saran to Count Verandis.\n\nThe trip shouldn't take very long. Not if everything goes right, at least."
"3952276-0-8049";"Yes. I have word from one of our spies that a rogue Reach clan corrupts our ancient practices for something unspeakable. I suspect they seek to use Namira's power for their evil deeds.\n\nNever mind the danger. This is an insult to all of us!"
"3952276-0-8050";"I need someone willing to brave the ruins of Briar Rock. A Reach clan known as the Thornroot have taken warriors from a rival clan, the Wildblood, there.\n\nThe Wildblood doubt their clan mates survive, but they still have a task they need help with."
"3952276-0-8051";"I'm an agent of Ard Caddach, the ruler of Markarth. He charged me to find out all I can about these deadly storms and put a stop to them. Reach witches aiding the Gray Host summon them.\n\nThey call them harrowstorms, if you can believe it."
"3952276-0-8052";"I'm an agent of Ard Caddach, the ruler of Markarth. He charged me to find out all I can about these deadly storms and put a stop to them. Reach witches aiding the Gray Host summon them.\n\nThey call them harrowstorms, if you can believe it."
"3952276-0-8053";"Rada aligned the orrery in order to make his escape. Use the keystone on the Dwarven mechanisms that control it. That should open a breach we can travel through.\n\nThen maybe I'll have a chance to stop this storm I created."
"3952276-0-8054";"Rada al-Saran escaped to his sanctuary realm in the Void. He's going to create the Darkstorm. Verandis says that after it uses up the energy already in the Dark Heart, it will start to feed on the rest of the Reach to power the storm."
"3952276-0-8055";"The Rites determine who may dwell in the Reach. They separate the strong from those too weak to survive in our lands.\n\nIf you do not belong among our people, then you shall perish. Do you have the strength of a Reachman?"
"3952276-0-8056";"My husband, <<1>>. We got into a shouting match and <<2>> ran away. She's our pet bunny.\n\nI told <<1>> he'd better go find her, so he followed <<2>>  up the hill to the north-east. But they've been gone for a while now."
"3952276-0-8057";"It was horrible. I've never seen anything like it. A roiling mass of black and crimson. It exploded right above Karthwasten. When it hit my village, people changed. They turned … feral. \n\nAncestors guide me, but I don't know what to do."
"3952276-0-8059";"Undaunted plunder! I'll tell you true, scamp. We've gotten our share of lazy or incompetent recruits lately. I mean, who falls to the Goblins in Fungal Grotto? Pssh.\n\nConsider this an incentive for better blood to show them how it's done."
"3952276-0-8060";"The Lothid, a local clan of vampires, terrorizes the countryside from their lair in the ruins beneath this mountain. This one convinced young Kathad to leave this clan of criminals. Or so I thought.\n\nFor some reason, he has returned to them."
"3952276-0-8061";"The attack on Markarth has begun, but we can still save the city if we hurry. Go, warn Ard Caddach. Tell him to defend his people. Every life saved is one less soul for the Dark Heart."
"3952276-0-8062";"Great! On your way to Understone Keep, look for Bradan. Arana brought the witch-rebels here to help and Bradan is leading the main contingent of warriors.\n\nHe needs to know that the whole purpose of all this is to kill as many Reachfolk as possible."
"3952276-0-8063";"The Thornroot clan plans to turn the Wildblood clan members they captured into briarhearts … against their will. Truly horrific. \n\nRescuing the captives will only delay their abusive ritual. We need a more permanent solution."
"3952276-0-8065";"The Wildblood clan believes that while the Thornroot have always been aggressive, a new hagraven matron has taken them from contentious to malevolent. \n\nRidding them of her influence might slow the Thornroot's thirst for blood."
"3952276-0-8066";"News of Rada al-Saran's death won't compare to the dead returning to life, but I'm sure Caddach will be relieved to hear it. \n\nYou find the ard and let him know there's nothing to fear from the Gray Host any more. Tell him he has Verandis to thank."
"3952276-0-8067";"I've no mind to your business. I, too, am returning at my own pace. Seeing my home again through living eyes is refreshing. And overwhelming."
"3952276-0-8068";"There have been sightings of a strange mushroom growing in Gloomreach. A few Reach shamans would like to get some samples collected. I told them I'd look for volunteers.\n\nFor a cut of the reward, of course."
"3952276-0-8069";"Reports of a strange fungal mold affecting the animals in Gloomreach have come to my attention. The Reachfolk think the magic in that place might be causing the animals to produce it, and that it could be quite useful if that's the case."
"3952276-0-8070";"There's a crazed mage performing dangerous experiments in the depths of Gloomreach. One of those experiments has been brought to my attention, and it has the potential to be catastrophic if not stopped."
"3952276-0-8072";"It took a bit of legwork, but some of the discoveries we made at Castle Thorn lead here. A place called Stone Garden. Some ancient Dwarven ruin taken over by a mad alchemist named Arkasis. I need to figure out what they're planning."
"3952276-0-8073";"In summary, my master and I are members of the Psijic Order. I, however, am a new recruit. I fear I may have blundered a transport spell upon arriving here. Master Pythis assured me he'd take care of it, but I still have concerns."
"3952276-0-8074";"Looking into what the Gray Host has been up to since you uncovered their plot in Western Skyrim. Seems they've been working with an outlaw alchemist called Arkasis who has a secret laboratory down here."
"3952276-0-8075";"No one sent you? What, you just stumbled on this place? You must be an adventurer! Like me!\n\nWell, you've found Black Drake Villa—the former home away from home of the Longhouse Emperors. And the place where they stashed something very important."
"3952276-0-8077";"Black Drake Villa. A place of luxury for the former Longhouse Emperors, now abandoned and left to the Goblins. \n\nA band of fire-slingers known as the True-Sworn have started rummaging around looking for something. We need you to clear them out."
"3952276-0-8078";"Of course he left the details up to me.\n\nI hired Drathas to access an important lockbox that I cannot. His family was captured by the same cultists that possess what I seek. Thus, I offered an exchange—he accesses the box and I save his people."
"3952276-0-8080";"We need you to head down into the Cauldron. It's an old mine that a bunch of obsessed cultists decided to take over with their pet Daedra. You can guess what kind of creepy rituals they might get up to.\n\nSounds like a fun challenge, right?"
"3952276-0-8082";"I hope so. The Reach has many small clans, and for the most part, we stay out of each other's business. But one local clan has made that impossible. \n\nA defector says their witch matron is attempting a dangerous ritual. She must be stopped."
"3952276-0-8083";"Possibly. A local clan seeks to perform a dangerous ritual. I suspect their witch matron seeks to harness Namira's power, but in doing so, ruptures the natural world. She's created pockets of unstable forces.\n\nThe ritual must be stopped!"
"3952276-0-8084";"Possibly. An outsider scholar insists there's some Dwarven metal beast wandering around a nearby cave. Says it's creating new mechanical spiders.\n\nHe needs someone to enter the cave and test this strange rod he invented to stop them."
"3952276-0-8085";"Just a rumor from one of our scouts. Apparently, he stumbled upon some new kind of Dwarf machine in a nearby cave system. Said he'd never seen anything like it. If the thing exists, it's supposedly laying out strange beacons in some kind of pattern."
"3952276-0-8086";"If you want to follow up on a rumor, I could use you.\n\nOne of our scouts was investigating a cave network nearby. He swears he saw some odd Dwarven beast wandering around down there, dropping a bunch of scrap metal. Enough to be of interest."
"3952276-0-8087";"There's a tough-talking Khajiit from House Ravenwatch. Calls herself Adusa-daro. She's looking for someone to help her with a delicate mission. I was all set to volunteer—for the right price, of course—when she told me the details."
"3952276-0-8088";"The Thornroot Hagravens lash you to an altar, carve out your heart, and then use foul magic to make you into one of their briarhearts.\n\nAt least, that's what they've been doing to my clan. I managed to escape, but all my kin are prisoners."
"3952276-0-8089";"After you revealed the Gray Host's plan in Western Skyrim, I went to Solitude to look into their activities. One day this worm Talfyg approaches me. Insists that an old vampire named Lady Thorn is building an army for the Host."
"3952276-0-8090";"After Stone Garden, I started digging into Lady Thorn's history hoping to find some connection to the Gray Host. \n\nThat's when this worm Talfyg found me. Insists the Lady has started amassing her own army and that he can show me what she's up to."
"3952276-0-8092";"Old Life is an Imperial tradition. At year's end, we write messages of remembrance for our dead loved ones in hopes that our words will reach them in Aetherius. The ceremony itself is quite beautiful."
"3952276-0-8094";"Titanborn wanted me to find you and tell you she was on her way, but she had something she had to look into first.\n\nShe said that if you weren't incredibly busy, she could use your help. Mentioned that you had an uncanny knack for solving problems."
"3952276-0-8095";"These two clan chiefs brought their children to participate in the rite of handfasting. Once they receive my blessing, they can announce their intention to marry and unite these clans in kinship.\n\nI'd like you to help me give that blessing."
"3952276-0-8096";"Well, you know what to do, right? Honestly, giving the same speech to every gutter troll who wants extra gold for sujamma gets tiresome after awhile. If I can spare you the sales pitch, more breath saved for me."
"3952276-0-8097";"Of course! Most wait a full day between their messages, but you can offer your words to Aetherius as many days as you wish. \n\nAnd you're in luck. I learned the location of another Old Life shrine, if you're interested in seeking it out."

"3952276-0-8108";"Most clans believe the halls of the Deep Folk are cursed. Maybe they are, but they knew how to work metal. In order to defend the Reach, we need armor and weapons.\n\nWe can make use of what the Dwarves left behind, even if it makes us uncomfortable."
"3952276-0-8109";"Silver-coated weapons and armor are essential for mortals seeking to hunt vampires and werewolves. We need more of the precious metal to defend our land against the Gray Host and similar threats."

"3952276-0-8119";"Verandis finished his own investigations and is waiting for you in Markarth. You can find him in Understone Keep. He's hovering near the throne, waiting for the ard to deign to speak to him.\n\nBut he really needs to talk to you for some reason."

"3952276-0-8197";"Governor Keshu wants to discuss the arrangements for the guests you brought to her city. It seems she has gotten word of an imminent threat."
"3952276-0-8198";"I received word that the Order of the Waking Flame is gathering outside the city. They appear to be seeking whatever you and Eveli turned up on your recent investigations. I suggest you make your way to Gideon and report to Governor Keshu right away."
"3952276-0-8199";"It runs in the family. Well, mom's side. Dad's a Hlaalu trader she partnered with for years before settling down—mostly settling down. She'd acquire all sorts of rare items for their clients, but my father said they haven't had any commissions."
"3952276-0-8200";"My client heard rumors of some ancient caches that have surfaced in Bloodrun Cave containing some … unsavory documents concerning the Morag Tong. Documents they'd prefer to keep far in the past, as I understand it."
"3952276-0-8201";"Mom will try her best to put her search for that puzzle box behind her, but I know her. The moment she catches wind of another flimsy lead she'll be off looking, just one more time.\n\nShe's only going to stop when it's found, or she's dead."
"3952276-0-8202";"I am Zeechis. I deal in rumors, especially the sort that hint at opportunities. For example, there is a cave called Deepscorn Hollow on an island by the coast. It is said to be a smuggler's den. \n\nBut that is not the only rumor about the place."
"3952276-0-8203";"Have you heard of Brittia Palenix? She's a brilliant local poet who is always looking for new sources of inspiration. \n\nApparently, she has heard rumors of a strange Daedric ruin that could be a potential source of material for her!"
"3952276-0-8204";"General Keshu the Black Fin sent me to find you. She wants to discuss arrangements for the guests you brought to Gideon. She fears their presence puts the city and its people at risk."
"3952276-0-8205";"Keshu the Black Fin sent me to find you. She would speak to you at once. The Order of the Waking Flame is on the move. The time has come to choose the ground on which we must meet them.\n\nPlease, go to Gideon."
"3952276-0-8206";"Before me are the bones of a nisswo, a priest of Sithis, who died searching for a special tome.\n\nI seek to whisper the proper words to ferry Nesh-Tei's soul through the Void and back to the Hist, but that cannot happen until the tome is found."
"3952276-0-8207";"The Wood Elf archer awaits you in the governor's mansion in Gideon. She says she must talk to you. It's urgent.\n\nShe said to tell you it concerns the Ambitions."
"3952276-0-8208";"Relax, this isn't a matter of life and death. Governor Keshu is throwing a victory celebration at her mansion. I order you to attend!\n\nOh, and grab Calia and Sombren on the way. They deserve a little revelry after what they've been through."
"3952276-0-8209";"Keshu the Black Fin summons all heroes of Blackwood to the governor's mansion in Gideon.\n\nShe also told me to ask you to stop and gather Calia and Sombren on your way. All who defended Blackwood must attend."
"3952276-0-8211";"My little brother and I answered a job posting seeking adventurers to help explore a newly discovered ruin, only once the expedition got underway—and we were all split up—our employers turned on us. I barely got away."
"3952276-0-8214";"Yes. A faithless weakling named Millona Brolus.\n\nWhen thieves came to my property, she spoke to them as friends and asked them to stop. As if that would stay their hands."
"3952276-0-8216";"Ahem. It reads:\n\n""Meet me at the graveyard east of Gideon. Need your help. Urgent."""
"3952276-0-8217";"The councilors have taken refuge in the castle and have been discussing options with the Chamber of Legates. They decided to send you and the Wood Elf to investigate the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary you learned about in Gideon."
"3952276-0-8218";"I have two clients with competing requests … about crow eggs from <<1>>.\n\nAllereth wants the crow eggs saved, while Rugrol wants them destroyed. Both are willing to pay, but I suppose the decision is up to whoever takes the job."
"3952276-0-8219";"Word has come to Leyawiin of dark deeds taking place in Xi-Tsei. Apparently, a group of Naga extremists called the Sul-Xan are capturing and sacrificing people there.\n\nMy client, Nalulie, came to me with the news and asked for help."
"3952276-0-8220";"A local bug lover is deathly worried that the eventual flooding of <<1>> will wipe out the rare species of torchbug that resides there. She will pay for someone to rescue them from their watery fate."
"3952276-0-8223";"A warlord named Naxhosa moved his people into the nearby ruins. They come every so often and demand our food and supplies. Then they beat us when there's nothing to hand over.\n\nSome try to fight back. But without our protectors, we're no match."
"3952276-0-8224";"A total tzilnech of a warlord called Naxhosa moved his people into our ruins nearby. He demands we hand over a portion of our food and supplies in return for safety.\n\nWith the state we're in, we just can't fight back to force them out."
"3952276-0-8230";"They recently pillaged my temple without warning or provocation, taking the relics in our keeping and striking down anyone who tried to stop them. This behavior is nothing like the Knights of the Silver Rose that I know."
"3952276-0-8232";"Red Petal Bastion. The stronghold of a knightly order who used to purge Daedric cults, but seem to have fallen from grace. Rumor has it they've turned all their plundered artifacts towards raiding and pillaging.\n\nWipe them out."
"3952276-0-8233";"We have come from the Battlespire to investigate the magical energies radiating from the Dread Cellar. This installation should be abandoned, but as you can see it isn't entirely empty.\n\nI'll turn a blind eye to any scavenging, if you assist us."
"3952276-0-8235";"The Dread Cellar. A secret Imperial prison abandoned after the Empire fell. Or it was supposed to be, because rumor has it the place is now crawling with Daedra working all kinds of unholy magic. You know what Undaunted do with Daedra, don't you?"
"3952276-0-8236";"Yes. You must listen to the muttering of the rivers, the stillness of the ponds … each of them carry a thousand stories. I wish to hear them all. \n\nYou are someone who can help me with that, I have no doubt."
"3952276-0-8243";"As many as we can. Let's get everyone in the same place so we can all collectively catch our breath. Everything happened so fast after we kicked Dagon in his ugly face, we didn't really get a chance to talk.\n\nMaybe we could all meet in Leyawiin?"
"3952276-0-8244";"Wretched Spire hides Daedra. Can't get summoned while here. We like that. But mortals want us gone. That won't happen.\n\nTephilaz seeks a treaty. Removing him delays that. The mortals may try to purge Daedra in his absence. If so, they'll die."
"3952276-0-8245";"A powerful Wraith-of-Crows from the Evergloam. Its approach is inevitable.\n\nBut there is hope. Aspects of the Horror are already manifesting in our realm in the form of cursed feathers that grow upon vile creatures. You must collect these feathers."
"3952276-0-8246";"I want to resume our search for the Fourth Ambition. And we should track down the other Ambitions, Sombren and Calia. They need to rejoin us before Mehrunes Dagon's lackeys find them.\n\nI also want to know why Dagon is interested in the Anchorite."
"3952276-0-8247";"Let me see the documents you found. \n\nI am familiar with nymics, but not this egonymic. If it truly has the power to banish Mehrunes Dagon, then no wonder the Longhouse Emperors kept it hidden. And what did you find in the doomvault?"
"3952276-0-8248";"More? Is Hezehk a memory stone? Do you expect me to recite the angry Dremora's words exactly as she yelled them at me?\n\nAt least the cute Wood Elf was nice to Hezehk. And the Anchorite always has a kind word. Weaklings!"
"3952276-0-8249";"You really don't know anything about where you are, do you? That's the Brandfire Reformatory. Nothing good happens there! The Order of the Waking Flame cult takes people inside and they don't leave again. It makes this one's fur stand on end."
"3952276-0-8250";"Everything I know about Deadlight is rumor and conjecture. It is a plane that suffered some great cataclysm in the ancient past. A realm forgotten and lost to time.\n\nI had hoped that Madam Whim would know more, but she claims the place is a mystery."
"3952276-0-8251";"I always have a plan, mortal. We will require allies for this. Rynkyus and his Bladebearers. And a way to get inside. The Waking Flame portal key will do … if we can attune it properly.\n\nAnd we need Arox. He should be familiar with Ardent Hope."
"3952276-0-8252";"The Dread Lady requires a mortal's perspective. She finds the situation merely curious, but says it has apocalyptic consequences for our plane of existence.\n\nCongratulations, mortal. She has chosen you. And she promises compensation, if you survive."
"3952276-0-8257";"Before we make use of the portal key, we must complete our own preparations. Then we can find the cult's base in Oblivion and determine their plans for the cataclyst.\n\nYou must acquire the root of a fluster fume plant and a tincture of befuddlement."
"3952276-0-8258";"What does the Dread Lady always want? Your rapt and undivided attention.\n\nYou helped her recover the portal key, but the work is not yet done. Before you can travel with her to whatever destination awaits, there are preparations to attend to."
"3952276-0-8259";"I want to resume our search for the Fourth Ambition. And we should track down the other Ambitions, Sombren and Calia. They need to rejoin us before Mehrunes Dagon's lackeys find them.\n\nI also want to know why Dagon is interested in the Anchorite."
"3952276-0-8260";"By entering the citadel they call Ardent Hope and hunting it down.\n\nOh, you mean how do we find the beast? My friend here, Atrozu, is … was my clan's totem spirit. He can track the Ravener. As for how to destroy it? I still need to figure that out."
"3952276-0-8261";"Ah … yes. I do that. I wasn't expecting anyone—oh! \n\nLord Sotha Sil, I'm doing what the Tribunal asked. I have the three Mother Stones and I know where the energy fonts are. I'll free the spirits from the False Martyrs' Folly, I swear!"
"3952276-0-8262";"The Crowborne Horror encroaches once more, as I predicted. You fought valiantly to push it back, but it is in the creature's nature to return. \n\nMore cursed feathers have begun to sprout in Tamriel. Gather them just like before."
"3952276-0-8263";"You are not wrong in your summation, but we are not without avenues to explore.\n\nRemember the broken sword hilt you found at Burning Gyre Keep? It carries the mark of the Bladebearers clan."
"3952276-0-8264";"I have heard of the location. A barren peak scoured by winds that flay flesh from bone. A good place to build a secret retreat, provided the walls can withstand the constant winds. \n\nSister Celdina has taken great care to hide the Riven Cataclyst."
"3952276-0-8266";"Those Kyncursed Waking Flame cultists are posting their propaganda all over the walls of Fargrave. Someone commissioned us to burn the pamphlets at their source, the Brandfire Reformatory."
"3952276-0-8267";"Yes. One of our skilled members, Airlur, discovered some relics of note in the Brandfire Reformatory. He thinks it's too risky to go retrieve them himself and the Gleaners agree, but we still want the relics. \n\nWe'll pay for your trouble."
"3952276-0-8268";"Yes! If you're brave enough to travel into the False Martyrs' Folly, there are some valuables that were left behind when those poor Dark Elves were turned into stone. \n\nMer, I hope it didn't hurt too much. That would be unbearable."
"3952276-0-8269";"There's a rare plant—the martyrs' copperleaf—that grows around the feet of the statues in the False Martyrs' Folly.\n\nNormally we wouldn't take this kind of work, but the healer Tuleenith needs it and we're feeling charitable."
"3952276-0-8270";"Pieron Desant—our founder—has some prisoners in the Blood Pit that he needs to communicate with. I have the letters here, so all you need to do is drop them in locked letterboxes. His contacts will pick them up when they think it's safe."
"3952276-0-8271";"Drops were made to our three designated sites in the Shambles. Dahliah let us know about the drops, but she needs to lie low for awhile. \n\nShe's usually at Madam Whim's if you want to talk to her. Just make sure you're not followed. She's in hiding."
"3952276-0-8278";"Well, jokes about swines and passing wind don't count as entertainment. Not for a whole festival. We need music! Dancing. Something … raucous.\n\nOh! I have the perfect minstrels in mind. If you handle recruitment, I'll prepare a stage!"
"3952276-0-8279";"This is Fargrave, a city in Oblivion with permanent and open connections to other realms. The cultists place those votive runes faster than I can destroy them, putting every mortal who lives here at risk. That's why I agreed to meet with the Dremora."
"3952276-0-8280";"The masked mortal has the right idea. Fargrave sits on the threshold to everywhere. If there exists a being who can decipher this code, we will find them here.\n\nI'd prefer it if we could find someone other than Madam Whim to deal with, however."
"3952276-0-8282";"Rayna Falas, a treasurer, heard that an Infernium called the Unmaker and its Havocrel keepers took out a group of Daedric merchants. Fargrave needs those goods and we need the profits.\n\nFighting that group won't be easy. I guess it's your lucky day."
"3952276-0-8283";"The Saraathu Tong's chief blacksmith, Ravam Drom, ran out of materials and our next shipment got delayed. He's just standing around the guild hall … relaxing.\n\nThere's a cache of weapons and armor in the den of the Unmaker. Bring them back for us."
"3952276-0-8284";"Vares Dredayn studies the death cycle of a creature called the Unmaker and he says it is ready to undergo another terminal experiment. Vares always pays good coin to ensure that someone places seeing stones around the den so he can gather data."
"3952276-0-8285";"A Mantikora, Taupezu Azzida, injects its prey with venom. Verdam Sedri, our poisoner, thinks he can make a new antidote. He'll pay someone to kill the Mantikora and gather samples from its victims.\n\nHe's in the guild hall if you have questions."
"3952276-0-8286";"Some kyncursed Dagonists stole the liminal rods used in our teleportation spell. The last group of hirelings sent by Ulvena Daren retrieved the rods. But those useless mercs were scared away by the Manikora Taupezu Azzida and left the pegs behind."
"3952276-0-8289";"Those fist-burning Dagonists left drugged prisoners outside Taupezu Azzida—a Mantikora's—lair!\n\nSenise Valno scryed for them in the guild hall and recognized a few of the prisoners as Tong operatives!"
"3952276-0-8292";"A band of mortal thieves tried to steal a large quantity of the drug known as Redmaiden.\n\nWhen I attempted to apprehend them, they ran to the Plaza of Portals and fled into the Sever."
"3952276-0-8293";"Lyranth sent word to Madam Whim. Asked her to locate you and send you to Wretched Spire. So of course, Madam Whim makes me run all over Oblivion and back to find you.\n\nIf this didn't help reduce my debt, I wouldn't have even bothered."
"3952276-0-8296";"Specificity, chum. Specificity is the problem.\n\nI've wandered the streets of Shimmerene. I've explored the cantons of Vivec City. But there's a whole wide world outside the city walls. Danger! Excitement! Scenic splendor! That's what people want!"
"3952276-0-8298";"I suppose it's time to tell you that the planestones you collected are not some baubles valuable only for their rarity. \n\nWhen brought together in a particular location, they open a portal to a secret lair where Uxark hid her treasure."
"3952276-0-8303";"Fantastic! Actually, it's terrible. I'm just reflexively optimistic.\n\nMy travel guide's out of date. Things change so quickly in Tamriel, you know? Maybe you could assist me again. Explore Vvardenfell, Clockwork City, and Summerset like last time?"
"3952276-0-8305";"I recently discovered that someone intends to auction off Mephala's chief artifact, the Ebony Blade. I hardly thought such a thing possible, but I leave nothing to chance.\n\nAs soon as I began making inquiries, House Hexos canceled the auction."
"3952276-0-8306";"An old associate of mine has gotten himself into a heap of trouble. Bad habit of his, but this time it looks like more than I can handle.\n\nI need to retrieve the items he was carrying—and rescue the fool if lady luck still has a shine on him."
"3952276-0-8308";"Coral Aerie. Way out off the northern coast of Summerset.\n\nWord is a group called the Ascendant Order took roost there and stirred up a nest of bloodthirsty yaghra. Sounds like a glorious mess get stuck in, yeah? So go get stuck in it."
"3952276-0-8309";"Za'ji came for bounty most enticing for a ship captain! Designs, drafted by the most brilliant shipbuilders of an era for the greatest fleet in the history of Tamriel: the All Flags Navy!"
"3952276-0-8311";"Shipwright's Regret. An ancient shipyard abandoned after some deadly catastrophe. All sorts of rumors about the place, but the one thing everyone agrees on is that it's haunted.\n\nBut you aren't afraid of some ghost stories, right?"
"3952276-0-8312";"Hezehk doesn't want to be doing this. I'd rather be set free by Madam Whim so I could do as I please. And what I please doesn't include delivering messages to mortals.\n\nBut here we are. Madam Whim sent me to tell you. Lyranth demands your presence."
"3952276-0-8313";"Another improvement! I've been trapped in this synchroseisiac state for I don't know how long. My senses, my self—scattered far and wide. I'm barely aligned enough to communicate. I need an intervention to pull me free.\n\nWould you help me?"
"3952276-0-8314";"The great and powerful Lyranth requires the assistance of a chosen mortal. That would be you, by the way. Among other things, I can tell because of the way your hands are glowing.\n\nThis concerns the ongoing threat of the Order of the Waking Flame."
"3952276-0-8315";"Of course. My mistress tells me everything. I am her prophet, after all.\n\nNow hurry. Lyranth and the Anchorite are waiting for you in the Bearer's Rest. It's an inn here in Fargrave."
"3952276-0-8316";"Lyranth the Dremora requires your presence at the House of Whims in Fargrave. She says the Order of the Waking Flame is still a threat to our realm—and yours."
"3952276-0-8317";"What do you think? Lyranth needs her pet mortal back at the House of Whims. Something about Valkynaz Nokvroz and the Anchorite. I think he's holding her prisoner in his fortress, Ardent Hope."
"3952276-0-8325";"Perhaps you are new to our dismal town. When the Daedra arrived, the decent residents like myself wished them gone. But they remain nonetheless.\n\nI heard rumors of a possible treaty. But we must make them leave! Certainly they can't kill us all."
"3952276-0-8326";"She awaits you in Wretched Spire, in the Deadlands. She seemed quite impatient. I imagine she is not as strict a master as Madam Whim or Lyranth, but still, I would not delay."
"3952276-0-8328";"Zenithar's blessed awl. Through the awl, all designs are made possible. Threads hold strong. Work progresses easily. It's a tool beloved of the Flonian family in Kvatch. And it was stolen.\n\nI need the help of a skilled individual to retrieve it."
"3952276-0-8329";"It's not difficult. All he asks is that we learn a new skill. Achieve great things. Recover what's lost in the dirt. Or trade with the merchants who give life to marketplaces.\n\nBut truthfully, anything you do whole-heartedly will please him."
"3952276-0-8333";"Ah, that part comes later. The darling Valessea has disappeared, so that takes precedence. \n\nI was hired by Lady Arabelle to pick up some medallions from Valessea. But when I got to her workshop, I found the place ransacked and she was gone."
"3952276-0-8335";"Oh, nothing tawdry, my dear. We'll be too busy for romantic shenanigans before long, I expect. \n\nSome precious cargo was supposed to sail in on the morning tide, but it never arrived. I need someone not known around the island to be my eyes and ears."
"3952276-0-8336";"Breton nobles? Yes, we heard that as well when the Ascendant Lord and the Magus were speaking in the crypts. That's something to go on.\n\nAnd if the alliance leaders didn't end up in the Shallows, we'll need to look elsewhere. What else, dear?"
"3952276-0-8337";"One is clearly the Dufort Shipyards, where the house constructs new vessels. Another is near Stonelore Grove, home to a circle of friendly druids. The third appears to be a cave near Tor Draioch.\n\nHmm. A strange set of disparate locations indeed."
"3952276-0-8338";"My wife. We came to this star-cursed Firepot cave to gather vulk'esh scoria. Given that we're looking for dangerous creatures, I suggested we hire someone to protect us. But no. She darted in there while I was planning how we'd search the cave."
"3952276-0-8339";"He performed tainted magic. Cleaved our bodies from mortality. But he didn't complete the ritual. His magic confined our bodies to the bounds of the keep. I couldn't allow Leobert to fix the spell, so I hid his ritual tools inside four sacred altars."
"3952276-0-8340";"My Privette is, without a doubt, the most beautiful sheep on the island. Just ask anyone and they'll agree.\n\nA swell of Hadolids reside in this cave. They displayed such inner ugliness and took Privette! I just heard her cries from inside."
"3952276-0-8342";"Lady Arabelle Davaux. Maybe you've heard of her? She's a famous investigator and author. Diplomat, too, which is why she's here.\n\nShe runs in circles way above my station, but I owe her a debt that I'm trying to pay. Maybe you can help me do that."
"3952276-0-8344";"It talked! Well, it politely asked me not to disturb the graves. Sounded like a noble, that skull. Promised me treasures and riches if I helped it. I ran instead."
"3952276-0-8345";"The jailers don't warn you. One of them plays with the prisoners waiting at Amenos Station. No one knows which one. If you're chosen, he sets you loose on Whalefall. Then, he hunts you down. \n\nSurvive and you go free. Supposedly."
"3952276-0-8346";"I need someone trustworthy to deliver the invitation medallions. Jakarn and I will deliver medallions to the alliance leaders so they can assign them to their chosen delegates.\n\nI'd like you to deliver the ones for the Fighters and Mages Guilds."
"3952276-0-8347";"Apologies! My name is Isobel Veloise. I'm an aspirant in the Sapphire Tourney, a proving ground for squires looking to join the knightly orders.\n\nAurelia's mother is knight commander, and umm … brashly offered her daughter's hand as a prize."
"3952276-0-8348";"Well, Aurelia has been the most desirable hand on High Isle for years, but no one thought she'd ever commit to a match.\n\nSeems the commander has forced the issue!"
"3952276-0-8349";"I knew you were a savvy one when I saw you. Name's Ilyes Maul, not one you'll know. Yet. Got notoriety in my blood, you see. My family's been making a name on the Abecean for generations. I'm here to start carving out my place among the greats."
"3952276-0-8350";"My partner and I were gathering intelligence on behalf of the Dominion in Shipwreck Shoals, but we were caught by Dreadsail pirates and separated.\n\nWe can't let the Sea Elves take documents worth so much to the Dominion for themselves."
"3952276-0-8351";"Her partner Anton was selected for that game one of the jailers plays. He hunts prisoners for sport on that island! She doesn't think he'll last.\n\nI've heard the prize for survival is your freedom, so maybe she just doesn't want to be alone."
"3952276-0-8352";"It's just a saying, dear.\n\nAs you're still on retainer, I'd like you to spearhead our rescue efforts. Jakarn will go with you to the island, then you'll split up to search for the royals. It's risky, but there's a lot of ground to cover."
"3952276-0-8353";"Doesn't she always? I assume it involves some crazy scheme to get you onto the prison island of Amenos to look for High King Emeric, Queen Ayrenn, and Prince Irnskar.\n\nShe would have selected me, but she knows I hate being the center of attention."
"3952276-0-8354";"Lord Bacaro and I have a secure place. They'll be safe enough there.\n\nSo far we've been on the defensive, reacting to events. The time has come to take the fight to the Ascendant Order. And my plan starts with this meeting you heard about on Amenos."
"3952276-0-8355";"Specific? Well, she mentioned reviewing her notes. And something about the peace talks, I think. Oh, and sweetrolls! She said she had sweetrolls! I love sweetrolls!\n\nOh yeah. And she wants to discuss the meeting that you and the prince heard about."
"3952276-0-8356";"I believe we can hold All Flags Castle with a few warriors, but if we need to fight our way past the Ascendant Order forces, we'll never reach the alliance leaders in time.\n\nWe require a ship the Ascendant Magus won't suspect."
"3952276-0-8357";"Oh, you know. Same old same old. The Ascendant Magus—Count Damard? What do we call him now? Anyway, he's assembled a fleet to send after the leaders on All Flags Islet.\n\nLady A has a plan, but as usual she refused to let me in on the details."
"3952276-0-8358";"I am the steward of Garick's Rest. I am bound to this place until someone completes the Trials of Worth. Three tests that measure the qualities a knight needs to bear Lady Garick's Sacred Shield.\n\nUnless you're a schemer like Amunara."
"3952276-0-8359";"Dame Madach and I are on a quest to slay the bloodmage who resides within this ancient edifice.\n\nI did extensive research to ready us for the trials ahead … but she forbade me from entering the fiend's lair now that we're here."
"3952276-0-8360";"The sailors and other jailers call that place the Coral Cliffs. I won't survive the trip inside. But you, you're an adventurer! You're my only hope of getting the survivors out. Another House Mornard ship expects us. Our prisoner exchange is overdue."
"3952276-0-8361";"That is what I hope to determine. The archdruid sent me to investigate, but it was all I could do to avoid the once-docile creatures of the grove. I found a few pockets of corruption that must be cleansed, but I need another druid to assist me."
"3952276-0-8362";"I was experimenting with a spell while my mentor, Magister Irin, was away. But the magic went … awry. If it doesn't get dealt with, it's going to spread beyond this area and harm a bunch of innocent people. I can't fix it on my own, so I need help."
"3952276-0-8363";"Steadfast Manor, the ancestral home of Lord Bacaro Volorus. Once war broke out, he turned it into a place of healing for the wounded. Soldiers of every faction stay here as they heal from their injuries.\n\nBut this malady threatens their recovery."
"3952276-0-8364";"Steadfast Manor belongs to Lord Bacaro Volorus. He shares his home as a place of healing for both body and soul. Wounded from all sides in the Three Banners War recover here.\n\nBut if this malady continues to spread, we may have to shutter it."
"3952276-0-8365";"Well, we still need to find the uh … delegates, right?\n\nWhile I kept the nobles at Castle Navire distracted with my rippling muscles, you grabbed that map from Duchess Elea. Lady Arabelle thinks it can help us with our … lost delegates problem."
"3952276-0-8366";"Good question. Many people desire the Prowler due to her speed and beauty. When we came ashore for supplies, I told my crew to keep watch. I hope they're safe.\n\nUntil we find her, Oblan and I are stranded. And we have important places to be."
"3952276-0-8368";"I sing to cast spells. Father says I'm suited to be a court performer, but I want to help people!\n\nMother wrote that Hadolid sea-monsters attacked the mine. Father's sentries were supposed to escort me to the mine, but they never came."
"3952276-0-8371";"That is what King Jorunn told me! He said, Rigurt, go to High Isle and be Ebonheart Pact cultural ambassador. And be large! Delegate-and-large, that is me!\n\nBut I lost my scepter of office. I had it with me last night, but now I can't find it."
"3952276-0-8375";"Into their damn prison stockade! And it won't be long before they finish processing him. Then they'll banish poor Valentyn into the jungle … and I'll never see my beloved again.\n\nHelp me save my husband, stranger. I'll pay you handsomely. Please!"
"3952276-0-8377";"Lord Bacaro needs to hear about our victory at All Flags. He can stop mustering a counter force, at least for now.\n\nThanks to you, Count Damard's plan to decapitate the alliances has failed. The leaders are safe and back to their usual bickering"
"3952276-0-8378";"How many times must we go over this? Lady A never gives me all the details. It's like she doesn't completely trust me or something.\n\nIt probably involves Lord Bacaro's peace talks—now that no one is actively trying to kill the alliance leaders."
"3952276-0-8380";"The death or capture of Taleria, the Fleet Queen of the Dreadsail pirates. She is the lynchpin holding those bloodthirsty Sea Elves together and the greatest obstacle standing between our navy and the elimination of these pirates."
"3952276-0-8381";"<The Fleet Queen's arcane talisman still clings to the crumbling coral of her tranformed body. It can stand as proof to Admiral Galvendier that our mission was a success.>"
"3952276-0-8382";"<I pulled a strangely heart-like knot of coral from the chest of Fleet Queen Taleria's transformed body. It's as close to proof of her death as I can provide to Admiral Galvendier under the circumstances.>"
"3952276-0-8383";"We are prosecuting a war against the Dreadsail pirate fleet and the Admiral ordered me to gather as many capable fighters as I can muster for a landing party. Need about a dozen, all told."
"3952276-0-8384";"No. We were just a bunch of street kids, but we were close. We made do with what little we could scrounge up, carved out a good life for ourselves.\n\nBut one day, they just … vanished."
"3952276-0-8385";"Possibly. He found someone who may recognize the badge on the mercenary armor that he remembers. \n\nIf he's right, that may lead us right to the bastards who took them. It was a long time ago, sure, but this is more information than I've ever had."
"3952276-0-8386";"It says that Jhaka and Silverslip are putting themselves in danger by looking for Song, and that they need to be careful.\n\nThe wording is friendly enough, but in that way where you can be certain that the message behind it is not."
"3952276-0-8388";"She's gone traveling. After that business with her mother and the tourney, I encouraged her to find her own way. Which is … grand. \n\nUnfortunately, some of her things were stolen. Including a signet ring I gave her many years ago."
"3952276-0-8389";"No, she didn't. But if you and I were wagering at a tavern, I'd put money down this is about Aurelia.\n\nSince I'm on errantry, she can't technically order me back. But she's like a second mother to me."
"3952276-0-8390";"All right … hmm. The Knight Commander is asking for another meeting. She's in Gonfalon Bay on business, at the Ancient Anchor Inn. \n\nApparently she wants to talk if I have the time."
"3952276-0-8394";"This treasure is important to me, but not so important that I want to wind up like the others who were helping me chase it. My years of cheating death are far behind me. I need someone to follow this map and recover the treasure for me."
"3952276-0-8395";"Za'ji came for bounty most enticing for a ship captain! Designs, drafted by the most brilliant shipbuilders of an era for the greatest fleet in the history of Tamriel: the All Flags Navy!"
"3952276-0-8398";"Yes, yes, of course. M'lady always says I'd misplace my head if it wasn't attached. Now where was I? Oh yes, the curse!\n\nMy mistress, Lady Laurent, was hired to help prepare this site for some important meeting or another. Then disaster struck!"
"3952276-0-8399";"My partner and I were gathering intelligence for the Covenant in Shipwreck Shoals, but we were caught by Dreadsail pirates and separated. \n\nWe can't let the Sea Elves steal vital documents from the Covenant, can we?"
"3952276-0-8400";"My partner and I were recovering intelligence for the Pact in Shipwreck Shoals, but we were caught by Dreadsail pirates and separated. \n\nImagine the harm Sea Elves could do with Pact maps and orders? We can't allow it."
"3952276-0-8403";"On the last celebration, you assisted me in crafting an offering befitting the Lord of Labor. The blessed tool entrusted to me went missing and I couldn't assemble his gift.\n\nBut seeing you, it must be a sign that my ill-fortune is in his plan."
"3952276-0-8405";"What else? She needs our help saving civilization as we know it. Or something along those lines.\n\nSpecifically, I think she wants you to help us find the missing alliance leaders."
"3952276-0-8406";"Tales of Tribute! It's a card game, a scavenger hunt … Z'en's price, it's practically a religion for some folks.\n\nPlayers match wits and decks in a contest of courage, preparation, and skill. You want fame? Gold? It's all there for the taking!"
"3952276-0-8407";"It's a game, of course! A card game to be precise— full of twists, and thrills, and canyon-deep strategy.\n\nI've been traveling around recruiting new players. It's been a lot of walking, but seeing the joy of new players makes it worth every step."
"3952276-0-8408";"This one has a list of rival chapters—each with a host of worthy players. Beat players in all three locales, and you will win a grand prize! But even a single victory will earn you a reward.\n\nYou are prepared, yes? Baan Dar favor you!"
"3952276-0-8409";"Good! You should seek out your fellow adventurers and challenge them to see who has the finest cards and sharpest mind. With every victory, your prize will grow!\n\nJust be careful not to play while eating powderbites. The dust—it gets everywhere!"
"3952276-0-8411";"Turns out the peace talks we were delivering those invitation medallions for is taking place right here on High Isle. Unfortunately, there's a new problem. \n\nLady Arabelle can tell you all about it. Assuming you're interested in helping us again."
"3952276-0-8412";"A local lord's having trouble with a pair of Eldertide theurges who took over land he owns on Amenos. They ran off his retainers, and they've barricaded themselves behind natural defenses.\n\nApparently, the druids are excavating the property."
"3952276-0-8413";"The gaming hall provides a wealth of opportunities for Roister's Club members. Why not look around and familiarize yourself with them?\n\nBrahgas can make the proper introductions. Speak with Sorinne, too. She's another protege of mine."
"3952276-0-8414";"Excellent! Sir Charles, an old knight of the Order of the Albatross, requires someone younger and more capable than himself to brave the ruins of Death's Valor Keep. You see, no one remains of the keep's original order to do what must be done."
"3952276-0-8415";"Excellent! I will add your name to the lists and pay the sponsorship fees so you can focus on the important part—winning!\n\nI admit our chapter has suffered … a dry season. But Zeht rewards those who endure!"
"3952276-0-8416";"Ever see a soulrazer knight? It's an animated suit of armor fueled by necromantic magic. And the biggest one anyone's ever heard of threatens priests on pilgrimage near Steadfast Manor. It's called the Sable Knight. The priests want it destroyed."
"3952276-0-8417";"Fauns are usually peaceful. Well, not murderous, anyway. But there's a vale north of All Flags Islet where hunters go in and don't come out. It belongs to a faun lord known as Glemyos Wildhorn.\n\nHe's hunting the hunters. And it's got to stop."
"3952276-0-8418";"Most excellent! A mage named Morgan Osina needs someone to enter the Firepot. A very hot, very dangerous cave southwest of All Flags Islet. The pay is good, provided you accomplish a small task.\n\nThe mage seeks assistance with some arcane research."
"3952276-0-8421";"Volcanic activity on the island seems to be reaching dangerous levels. If something isn't done to quell the forces at work, we're all going to be swimming in lava. The Stonelore Circle Druids are trying to stop it, but we need help."
"3952276-0-8423";"My partner and I are purveyors and creators of fine drinks. Hilgrim does more drinking than creating, however, which got us into our current trouble. We were on the cusp of making a groundbreaking new spirit … then Hilgrim drank our entire supply."
"3952276-0-8424";"Then we are the perfect pair! Borzadar, a page from House Dufort, brought word that his lord requires someone to enter Breakwater Cave on the southern coast of High Isle and destroy crates of supplies stolen by Hadolids.\n\nYes, destroy. Not recover."
"3952276-0-8425";"The Stonelore Circle asked for help. A Sea Elf zealot named Serpent Caller Vinsha is meddling with native snakes in the hills east of All Flags Island. She warps them with Maormer magic, making them dangerously aggressive. We need to stop her."
"3952276-0-8429";"Brilliant! A Society of the Steadfast advocate needs someone to investigate a small island off the western coast of Amenos. Prisoners she represented have disappeared from the Amenos stockade. She thinks they were sent to that island to die."
"3952276-0-8432";"Great! I'm sure you've heard of the Ascendant Order. They're rogue knights, pillaging and murdering in the name of their cause. Two fanatical Ascendants in the western part of High Isle have been using dark magics to ensnare hapless wanderers."
"3952276-0-8433";"The alchemist Bethes Romavel has asked us to find someone willing to harvest brine glands from Hadolids while they're molting. My understanding is you can just scoop the glands out of their soft-shelled bodies. Who wouldn't want to do that?"
"3952276-0-8434";"Ha! Yes! The Tales of Tribute Novice Tournament, silly! The one where all the Roister's Club chapters' novice-tier players square off against one another? Ringing any bells?\n\nThe first round begins soon, and you qualified to enter!"
"3952276-0-8436";"Brahgas began pacing as soon as I gave him the news, so clearly he is ready. As for Sorinne? She seems less so.\n\nIt would be a pity if she withdrew. Advancing without her help …. I do not want to say it is impossible, but it is very unlikely."
"3952276-0-8437";"An agent representing all three alliances here on High Isle has a task if you're willing. A number of alliance ships have wrecked in the nearby waters lately. Each carried uniforms that could be used as disguises if they fall into the wrong hands."
"3952276-0-8438";"That's good since I must hire a worker. A mage requires someone to travel to the Coral Cliffs in northern Amenos and gather ritual components from the druids of the Eldertide Circle.\n\nAnd full disclosure, these druids are not the friendly sort."
"3952276-0-8439";"Volcanic activity on the island seems to be reaching dangerous levels. If something isn't done to quell the forces at work, we're all going to be swimming in lava. The Stonelore Circle Druids are trying to stop it, but we need help."
"3952276-0-8443";"Well, the tournament can have only one victor.\n\nUnlike previous matches where you, Brahgas, and Sorinne rose or fell as a chapter, the final challenges rest upon your achievements as an individual."
"3952276-0-8445";"You probably think you know all there is to know about Tribute, but I promise you there's more. Master Razhamad has all the details back in the Bay and he'd love to share them with you.\n\nIn fact, I was about to head back there myself. Come on!"
"3952276-0-8446";"Sure is! Hope you're prepared. This tournament's going to be much tougher than the last one.\n\nRazhamad's waiting for you back at the gaming hall in Gonfalon Bay. He'll give you all the details. Now, I just need to find Sorinne …."
"3952276-0-8448";"No, the final frog racing tournament. Yes, of course the Tales of Tribute tournament!\n\nEveryone's gathering back at the gaming hall in Gonfalon Bay. You should high-tail it back there and check in with Razhamad."
"3952276-0-8449";"This one has a list of rival chapters—each with a host of worthy players. Beat players in all three locales, and you will win a grand prize! But even a single victory will earn you a reward.\n\nYou are prepared, yes? Baan Dar favor you!"
"3952276-0-8450";"Good! You should seek out your fellow adventurers and challenge them to see who has the finest cards and sharpest mind. With every victory, your prize will grow!\n\nJust be careful not to play while eating powderbites. The dust—it gets everywhere!"
"3952276-0-8452";"I don't know! I was just trying to cut through the area around the old wizard's tower there when I spotted those strange … motes. It was chaos. Unnatural things started happening and then one of the motes started chasing me!"
"3952276-0-8453";"I was on a hunt, when I received word that the Gray Host had overrun these lands.\n\nAn army of parasites from out of the past. Even the dregs have proven to be a worthy challenge. But a true hunter does not shrink from danger."
"3952276-0-8454";"Archdruid Devyric and the Firesong Circle, they attacked. My Stonelore siblings kept this land safe for centuries!\n\nThe archdruid here opened the enclave to them and Archdruid Devyric killed her. They killed everyone."
"3952276-0-8456";"The Earthen Root Enclave. Some simpering Stonelore Druids said that another druid circle invaded. This wouldn't always catch our attention, but there's few who have fought druids. It could be a compelling challenge."
"3952276-0-8457";"I'm helping a friend research the ancient Druid King's voyage from High Rock to the Systres. His ship's log begins midway across the Abecean Sea. Right where we now stand.\n\nI must learn why the book starts here. And how that storm rose to greet us."
"3952276-0-8459";"Graven Deep. A small region within the Abecean Sea. Pirates scare each other with tales of how no one who enters ever leaves.\n\nI hear someone sailed in anyway and found an island haunted by undead. Now's your chance to kill them all over again."
"3952276-0-8460";"My Privette is, without a doubt, the most beautiful sheep on the island. Just ask anyone and they'll agree.\n\nA swell of Hadolids reside in this cave. They displayed such inner ugliness and took Privette. I just heard her cries from inside!"
"3952276-0-8461";"I'll sell tours of the islands to wealthy visitors. Wine them, dine them, and show them the sights. They'll tell their friends all about us when they return home!\n\nWith an enterprise such as this, we'll soon be rolling in gold!"
"3952276-0-8465";"A circle of druids that usually stick to their own island. Lately, however, they've been turning up all over and attacking people. I hoped I was done with them after Earthen Root Enclave, but Dhulef spotted them while investigating a lead."
"3952276-0-8466";"They are tailing Raz. Raz already has tail, far sleeker than they and less clumsy to boot. \n\nBut still, this one cannot complete his mission without first being rid of these annoying fleas."
"3952276-0-8467";"House Mornard wants a mineral survey of the Embervine caverns. I really need the work, so I leapt at the offer.\n\nBut no one mentioned the Firesong Druids. Or the lava. They're intentionally opening fissures! Who does that?"
"3952276-0-8469";"The Ascendant Lord and his minions are still out there somewhere. Lord Bacaro is hesitant to proceed when an attack could occur at any moment, but I can't keep the alliance leaders here much longer. Their patience with the situation grows thin."
"3952276-0-8470";"Then we must assume that Count Stefan and Druid Laurel are in danger. If Lord Bacaro truly believes he's the heir to the Ivy Throne of the druids, he'll stop at nothing to get his way.\n\nWe must go to Galen and defend the remaining regalia."
"3952276-0-8471";"Well, Lady Arabelle doesn't exactly trust Za'ji with all the details. But she did impress upon Za'ji that she had urgent matters to discuss with you. So, she sent Za'ji to find you."
"3952276-0-8473";"I don't trust Archdruid Orlaith to spare my son, even if she gets everything she wants. I will instruct my knights to stand down. Let her think I am paralyzed by this threat. Meanwhile, we secretly work to save Stefan from the Firesong."
"3952276-0-8474";"The usual. Well, more than that. Galen's beset by Sea Elf pirates, but these aren't the usual isolated raids. House Mornard's defending the isle as best they can, but their knights are stretched thin. And the druids are too distracted to lend a hand."
"3952276-0-8476";"An effective course on Dragon slaying, courtesy of the Elsweyr Dragon Defense Force. \n\nAs of late, the scaly beasts have caused far too many deaths. So this one put together a proper training program for both amateurs and veterans alike!"
"3952276-0-8477";"I can't leave Vastyr. Someone has to pick up the pieces, and that responsibility now falls on me. \n\nFind Druid Laurel. She needs to know that Archdruids Rahval and Ellic are dead. That Orlaith and the Firesong have the sacred seeds."
"3952276-0-8478";"Frii is our secret weapon. Dhulef will take Frii to the Temple of Y'ffelon, just as Archdruid Orlaith demanded. Then, while Frii stalls her with this guardian you told me about, you and I rescue the captives from the Firesong. Including Laurel."
"3952276-0-8479";"The beginning? The man who we thought was a champion of peace turned out to be the enemy in the shadows—the Ascendant Lord! And now Lady Arabelle thinks he's after the regalia of the Druid King!\n\nAn Ivy Throne to replace the Ruby Throne, yes?"
"3952276-0-8480";"My cousin, Octin over there. That's how this happened! \n\nWe went to … procure equipment from Fauns' Thicket. Octin picked up a stone tablet, but he's as graceful as a drunk sow when he's figuring out our profits. He dropped it and poof!"
"3952276-0-8481";"The archipelago is too large for me to investigate by myself. We have to drive the Ascendant Lord out of hiding and put an end to him and his Ascendant Order. Since you know the movers and shakers on Galen, I'd like to send you there in my stead."
"3952276-0-8484";"By the Green, I hope so. The Stonelore and Eldertide Druids. They're in as much danger as we are. Perhaps more so because the Firesong want their sacred seeds. We need them to help us defend the city.\n\nAnd that's where you come in."
"3952276-0-8486";"Excellent. Samara had a feeling.\n\nSince your last training, the Dragons have no doubt become stronger. A refresher course is always useful. Tell me, do you remember the trials?"
"3952276-0-8488";"Those Sea Elves in Llanshara found a druid relic. Our employer wants us to procure it—quietly.\n\nWithout Umindior, this job will take more time. And, the longer I stay here, well, it could get loud."
"3952276-0-8489";"Yes, outsider. Animals lash out. The spirit motes that once inspired us blanket the land in a thick fog. \n\nThe Spirit of the Path may be injured or frightened. I do not know what the Firesong want or how they turned my home against me."
"3952276-0-8490";"Well, truth be told, she contacted me. Easier to get a message to Castle Mornard than to find a Sea Elf hiding in the wilderness.\n\nWhen Sealord Nalos rejected King Orgnum's orders, he seized Siravaen's ship and scattered her crew. She needs our help."
"3952276-0-8491";"Exactly what I said. Supposedly, he's centuries old, but the only thing in his empty head are two riddles. They concern a long-lost treasure called the Gloomlantern. \n\nI can't make sense of it, and neither could my crew, Tava guide their souls."
"3952276-0-8493";"Just because they're intelligent creatures doesn't mean that they don't need help. The herd is suffering because a wolf pack moved in. The great beasts are eating every creature in sight! It's only a matter of time before they eat the Fauns, too."
"3952276-0-8509";"Sometimes, things align in the strangest ways, don't they?\n\nI need you to kill the forest wraith haunting the Valley of the Watcher. While you're there, I'd ask you to collect some of the giant sunflowers that have sprung up in the glade there."
"3952276-0-8513";"You know what I've been thinking? Savage Systres Tours is missing the one thing every tourist loves: souvenirs! Thankfully I have just the idea to solve this pressing issue.\n\nRadiant cores from Embervine! The perfect keepsake!"
"3952276-0-8514";"Have you heard of Embervine? It's a volcanic area in eastern Galen. Picture burning magma, lush jungles, and twisting caverns … all at once! A Dark Elf named Urtisa Drolnor told me all about it.\n\nI wish I could go see it, but I'm busy here."
"3952276-0-8515";"Have you heard of Fauns' Thicket? It's a druidic site northwest of Vastyr. I hear it's filled with cute critters infused by its latent magic.\n\nNow, what if you brought back some of these adorable critters for Savage Systres Tours to display?"
"3952276-0-8516";"Galen is savage, untamed, and rugged. That brings in the intrepid explorers. But this island is also downright gorgeous, too. And no place is more gorgeous than Fauns' Thicket on the western coast.\n\nThe flowers there are simply lovely!"
"3952276-0-8517";"Did you know Sea Elves live on this island? How exotic is that? Could you imagine having a Sea Elf pirate captain lead your tour through the jungles and shoals of Galen?\n\nThat would certainly put Savage Systres Tours on the map!"
"3952276-0-8518";"Do you know what Savage Systres Tours needs? We have jungles and volcanoes and caverns but what we really need is some history! We like to cater to a patron's mind as well as body.\n\nSo to Y'ffre's Path we go!"
"3952276-0-8524";"By the tide, am I glad you asked. I've got an urgent job from the north side of Galen, best handled in a group. \n\nA forest wraith has taken a group of hirelings under House Mornard captive, but there's still time to save them."
"3952276-0-8525";"I've got a request from a fellow Stonelore druid today. A task of high importance, best tackled in a group.\n\nDeep in the woods of Galen, ever-elusive phoenix moths emerge from cocoons of burning ember. I need you to gather some."
"3952276-0-8526";"Apparently, the Firesong Druids have unearthed empowering relics made by the Druid King himself. \n\nThat's bad enough news on its own, but now the relics are being used to empower a chimera and twist its will to carry out their bidding."
"3952276-0-8527";"Have you ever heard such different accounts of the same event that you're sure someone's lying?\n\nWell, we have some Stonelore initiates that were attacked … by a chimera. Now, our resident healers say their wounds aren't responding to treatment."
"3952276-0-8528";"Do you feel the rumbling beneath our feet too? I was worried it was something I ate until we received reports of a nearby chimera. It seems the restlessness of Y'ffelon sent the beast into a frenzy."
"3952276-0-8529";"While I return to High Isle and make final preparations for the peace talks to commence, I'd like you to help Druid Laurel with one more thing.\n\nWhen you're finished, meet me at Mandrake Manor."
"3952276-0-8531";"Yes, I wondered about that, too. But like I said, urgent business. I've been working with him and the count to prepare the city's defenses. We're just about set, but I wish we had more defenders to walk the battlements.\n\nAnyway, about Stefan …."
"3952276-0-8534";"A temporal distortion swirls through Bal Sunnar. I wanted to find the source before it affected causality. But I'm too late. Somehow, these Telvanni met us already. Events have occurred out of order for them.\n\nWhy did they call us a scourge, though?"
"3952276-0-8536";"Bal Sunnar. Some Telvanni Dark Elves built a town tucked away in the Stonefalls mountains. Word is that those strange wizards have decided to play around with time.\n\nSounds to me like it's time to kick the door in and find out what they're up to."
"3952276-0-8538";"Stefan says the two of you learned that an attack on Vastyr is imminent during your time at Tonnere Castle. I suspect this has something to do with that."
"3952276-0-8539";"The vents are causing problems all over Galen—activity is at an all-time high. If something isn't done, these vents could lay waste to vast areas of the island. Perhaps raze everything to the ground."
"3952276-0-8541";"The usual. Well, more than that. Galen's beset by Sea Elf pirates, but these aren't the usual isolated raids. House Mornard's defending the isle as best they can, but their knights are stretched thin. And the druids are too distracted to lend a hand."
"3952276-0-8542";"The vents are causing problems all over Galen—activity is at an all-time high. If something isn't done, these vents could lay waste to vast areas of the island. Perhaps raze everything to the ground."
"3952276-0-8546";"My profession takes me all over the world, crafting new delicacies. And Galen here is bubbling with potential!\n\nI want to make the spiciest dish in all of Tamriel. A dish that melts in your mouth … or that just plain melts your mouth! Hah!"
"3952276-0-8547";"You see that sad sap, there in the sand? Bleached by the sun, not yet claimed by the ocean—that's what's left of me. My ring remains upon my finger by some act of love or chance. \n\nI want my wife, Frelene, to have it. Will you return it to her?"
"3952276-0-8548";"The count isn't one to explain his orders, but I suspect it has something to do with the Firesong Druids and their Sea Elf allies. They're holding Sir Stefan hostage after that business at the Draoife."
"3952276-0-8607";"He wants us to help him make plans for dealing with Archdruid Orlaith. We can't let her fulfill the prophecy and become the new Druid King. After the things we've already see her do, that would be a disaster."
"3952276-0-8609";"The usual. Well, more than that. Galen's beset by Sea Elf pirates, but these aren't the usual isolated raids. House Mornard's defending the isle as best they can, but their knights are stretched thin. And the druids are too distracted to lend a hand."
"3952276-0-8610";"The Prince of Fate, the Guardian of the Unseen, the Lord of Secrets. Perhaps you know him as Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Knowledge and Memory.\n\nHe has seen many paths forward, but only one where both Nirn and Apocrypha survive."
"3952276-0-8614";"We are bound together by a common danger. Enemies of Hermaeus Mora threaten his realm of Oblivion—and in so doing, pose a threat to the mortal world as well.\n\nTherefore Mora sent me to meet you here and secure your cooperation."
"3952276-0-8615";"When Prelate Faram and his aides arrived, my fellow Keepers of the Dead were plagued with a strange malady. I was away when the disease struck and I haven't been allowed back inside since.\n\nThe prelate said the abbot ordered the closure, but …."
"3952276-0-8616";"That has yet to be determined. One of the strands of fate revealed to me converges at this location. More than that, Hermaeus Mora expects us to learn for ourselves.\n\nOf the three sites, this one requires that I be on hand to assist you."
"3952276-0-8617";"Not much to tell. I just arrived myself. This mortal served the Great Eye, but he died before he could tell me about the other Daedric cultists that scamper about.\n\nThey're creating an intolerable contradiction in reality. Makes my tentacles ache."
"3952276-0-8618";"I admit the particulars of their plan currently elude me. Clearly, they believe the relic—this Fulcrum Obscura—and the rite are key to remembering the dream they seek.\n\nTo stop them, we must learn more about the dream and the secret it holds."
"3952276-0-8619";"Torvesard has allies as well. Master Shelreni. Vaermina and Peryite. Blightcrown and the Hidden Kindred cultists. They seek to restore memories stolen from them by Hermaeus Mora. And, from what you saw, Torvesard has started the restoration process."
"3952276-0-8620";"Scruut can provide more information, as it is a vital part of her job. After repairing a thread of fate, she must record the final details in the Chronicle of Apocrypha. Having your name inscribed therein is a great honor."
"3952276-0-8621";"The Consortium will be none too pleased. Apologies, traveler. I came on a little strong there. I'm an auditor sent to inspect Anchre Egg Mine. It's been a few days since their last shipment and the higher ups are growing restless."
"3952276-0-8622";"The punishment of Luaffyn Romavel. She convinced those Camonna Tong scoundrels to take Argonian soldiers hostage and force the Ebonheart Pact to pay a large sum for their release. I'm here to ensure that her plan fails and she never hatches another."
"3952276-0-8623";"Quires Wind is a scriptorium. Here the Great Eye's Daedra bind secrets into tomes. Ciphers like me help with this sacred task, preparing materials. Ink, blank pages, bindings. But the new scrolls Cipher Sabinius brought to the Wind are corrupt!"
"3952276-0-8624";"Seems my know-it-all twin found a way to become even more pretentious. At least, I'm pretty sure it's him. Hmm. No, it's definitely him.\n\nI think he wants me to enter the study to find a way to fix him. Care to join? I've coin if you're interested?"
"3952276-0-8625";"I am Landolvel, first mate on the Opulent Gale. My father, Naanurrel, is the ship's captain. We were trapped in a horrible storm. I fell into the churning sea. I was dragged under the waves, blacked out, and awoke nearby in a ships' graveyard."
"3952276-0-8626";"Dremnaken. Our order, the Remnants, gathers knowledge. These beasts consume it.\n\nThey breached our wards, burrowing into the Apogee. Relics from across Apocrypha are now at risk. We must drive them out. You've arrived to aid us."
"3952276-0-8627";"I'm a courier for a cadet branch of House Hlaalu. My superiors tasked me with an urgent delivery to a member of the House in Necrom.\n\nI just landed this position—I don't want to lose it. But I can't complete the delivery in this state!"
"3952276-0-8628";"Ah yes! I am Balver Bemis, retainer to Oathman Llaro Ralas of House Telvanni.\n\nLlaro suffers from beastly headaches, and I'm making a tincture to address his malady. I need some hard-to-attain ingredients. If you aid me, I'll pay you well."
"3952276-0-8633";"Tel Huulen. The tower at Ald Isra's east end. Inside there's a green mushroom. By that mushroom, there's a Dark Elf. She'll probably insult you. She's my contact.\n\nDeliver this letter, then walk away with a pocket full of gold."
"3952276-0-8634";"You did? I … I am unsure how I feel about that. I want to ask you a thousand questions, but the corruption plaguing Apocrypha grows worse with every passing moment and Vaermina still roams free. I am torn as to what to do."
"3952276-0-8635";"How far our clan has fallen to go unrecognized. We are the Remnants, swords of Lord Hermaeus Mora. He bestowed a portion of his will upon us in exchange for our defense of Apocrypha. This pact has stood for eons.\n\nUntil recently. It may be lost."
"3952276-0-8636";"Kemel-Ze, where the Magician himself studied among the Dwarves, is under attack. The Painted Eye found Kemel-Ze despite all our secrecy!\n\nI left Nilphas Drethan to defend Sotha Sil's laboratory since he's a Clockwork Apostle."
"3952276-0-8637";"There's a barrier. It keeps the exhibits inside. We can't leave the gallery.\n\nThose Daedric Dreamcarvers mucked everything up. Now, no cipher's alive to bring me books! We had a deal! No books, no me!"
"3952276-0-8638";"The Rectory houses one of Hermaeus Mora's most prized magical apparatuses. The vessels that comprise it suddenly began to fail, and now the whole thing risks collapse! Huzmargo knows not how! Or why! Nor why? Nor why!\n\nHe needs help!"
"3952276-0-8639";"They stole a secret! I carried it through this awful Ravening Morass to trade at the Obscured Forum. Madam Whim wants a boon from Hermaeus Mora.\n\nBut, the Voidprowler clan found me. Kicked me! Then, stole the secret. I'll never get it back."
"3952276-0-8640";"I woke with three of my master's prized tomes in my possession, but no memory of taking them. I must return them before my Prince notices they're missing, but the Sidereal Cloisters are dangerous.\n\nWill you aid me? I have coin if that interests you."
"3952276-0-8641";"That fetching thief has been a thorn in my side for far too long!\n\nHe's planning to rob the shrine at Sailenmora of the sacred relic of Saint Vorys. I need extra hands if I'm to stop him. Yours could do. Are you looking for work?"
"3952276-0-8642";"Nathyn and I had plans to leave Tel Dreloth together. Someone must have found out, because the day we planned to leave, I was dismissed from my position.\n\nMistress Dreloth—or Sathile, I suppose—pushed me out without a chance to see Nathyn."
"3952276-0-8656";"Hermaeus Mora's enemies assail Apocrypha. Specifically Bastion Nymic—a stronghold where dangerous names of power are stored.\n\nThe Golden Eye needs someone to rout these enemies and the Herald that leads them. The reward will be substantial."
"3952276-0-8658";"The island of Gorne is home to a reclusive portal mage by the name of Dreynis. His research could further my ascension within House Telvanni. I could use a skilled hand to aid me while I procure these findings."
"3952276-0-8659";"Oh fathomless Prince, that's a relief. To think I let myself be spooked by a mere mortal. Erm, sorry. You see, I may have accidentally sent a prized possession of my master's to be unwoven.\n\nI don't suppose you'd help poor Ogle?"
"3952276-0-8660";"I've been cutting down these mercenaries for the better part of the day. I'm guessing my target knows I'm on to her and has started sending them my way.\n\nMy associate Harn Orenvi might know something about it, but I can't bring this heat to him."
"3952276-0-8661";"He hired me and paid me on time. That's all you need to know.\n\nBut I haven't heard from him since the Reynila job. I figured he had some connection to the Reformer and my forgotten past. I was thinking we ought to pay him a visit."
"3952276-0-8662";"As far as I can tell. Mevei said she's been adjusting well to her new life. Didn't say where specifically, in case the letter got intercepted.\n\nBut Dimik-ei wants to meet. She's going to be in Shadowfen, in the marshes north of Alten Corimont."
"3952276-0-8663";"I reached out to everyone I could think of to ask for help in finally finding this guy.\n\nMevei wrote back. She's asked us to meet in Reaper's March at the inn in Rawl'kha."
"3952276-0-8664";"I'd like your help tracking down a former associate of mine. I was attempting to create a relic of great power and now find my fate … frayed, for lack of a better term.\n\nI call this relic the Fateweaver Key."
"3952276-0-8665";"This is what I like about you, cohort. You're results-driven, focused. Oh, I'm ready to take the next step, build on the work that we did to smooth my fraying fateline.\n\nAnd one day fix the Fateweaver Key! Hah!"
"3952276-0-8666";"My adversary has somehow transcended the limitations of the other frayed fates. It has an awareness of its own existence, agency, and a malign intellect. \n\nHmm. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the warning from that Daedra, Tem."
"3952276-0-8667";"Absolutely! But the adversary is inextricably bound to my fateline. Thankfully, my studies have uncovered a way forward. \n\nWe must procure a mystic text called the Unraveling Palimpsest. It currently resides within a tome trove called Quires Wind."
"3952276-0-8668";"Giving Vaermina access to Apocrypha and a host to work through. They must know where to find the memory they seek. Or they have a good idea where to look.\n\nApocrypha is infinite. Without fate to guide us, we are lost in the dark without a candle."
"3952276-0-8671";"I imagine he's worried about Laurel and Frii. Someone needs to break the news to them about Archdruids Rahval and Ellic. Warn them that Archdruid Orlaith now has all three sacred seeds. \n\nAnd maybe do something about it, too."
"3952276-0-8672";"She could have served Hermorah well. But she sought to control events across the realms. \n\nKeshargo was foolish, blinded by her potential. He only just managed to hide the Itinerant Staff before she took the title of Magnastylus from him."
"3952276-0-8674";"Scrivener's Hall. Those slime-worshiping librarians just went through a change in leadership. Doesn't seem like it was too amiable though, because the old leader says he wants to reclaim the throne—metaphorical throne, of course."
"3952276-0-8675";"The Shrine of Saint Vorys, patron saint of House Telvanni. It's the only reason why anyone would go to Sailenmora.\n\nI stopped by to see the relic of Saint Vorys, but the high priest wouldn't even let me get close enough to get a good look!"
"3952276-0-8677";"Magic gone awry, mortal. I operate Oblivion's premiere traveling creature exhibit. Notable entities across the planes demand to see my show.\n\nBut, while portaling to Fargrave my spell inverted and I crashed here. My creatures fled into your land."
"3952276-0-8678";"We are bound together by a common danger. Enemies of Hermaeus Mora threaten his realm of Oblivion—and in so doing, pose a threat to the mortal world as well.\n\nTherefore Mora sent me to meet you here and secure your cooperation."
"3952276-0-8679";"We are bound together by a common danger. Enemies of Hermaeus Mora threaten his realm of Oblivion—and in so doing, pose a threat to the mortal world as well.\n\nTherefore Mora sent me to meet you here and secure your cooperation."
"3952276-0-8681";"The Remnants are … were … blades of Lord Hermaeus Mora. He imbued us with a portion of himself so we could defend his realm. For eons, this pact held.\n\nNow, the Dreamcarvers may take our gifts for themselves."
"3952276-0-8684";"Leramil had the audacity to summon me into her presence. I hate when mages do that. It's very disconcerting. There one moment, here the next. And then she locked eyes with me. Refused to blink or turn away. That's no way to treat a Watchling."
"3952276-0-8685";"The Disquiet Study! I was, am, an archivist there. The books have always been a bit animate in the study, but they've started pouring their contents out into the world!\n\nI tried to warn the Nord woman I just passed, but she just laughed!"
"3952276-0-8689";"He's trapped in a nightmare. A product of his own foolishness and arrogance. He decided to study a dangerous artifact, neglecting to use protective wards. Now Ansuul the Tormentor has him in her clutches. She won't let him wake."
"3952276-0-8690";"<This must be the Dreamstone that housed Ansuul the Tormentor. I should return it to Wizard Twelvane.>"
"3952276-0-8691";"<I defeated Ansuul the Tormentor inside her own domain and recovered a Whispering Dreamstone. I should bring it to Wizard Twelvane for safe keeping.>"
"3952276-0-8692";"You know how powerful mages can be. We command the elements or make things from nothing. We can summon entities from across Oblivion. Even shape reality if you want to be grandiose about it.\n\nBut what if we … summon something terrible?"
"3952276-0-8693";"I need a skilled adventurer for a mission in a dangerous situation. \n\nThe kwama eggs deep within Anchre Egg Mine are in high demand, but some crisis there has led the workers to flee. A common occurrence, I'm afraid. Egg miners …."
"3952276-0-8694";"The local merchants report that their regular shipments aren't reaching Necrom. We suspect the Camonna Tong are keeping the missing goods in Camonnaruhn. \n\nRetrieve the stolen merchandise and bring it to Necrom."
"3952276-0-8695";"We received a directive from Sotha Sil himself. The Clockwork God has requested that we send someone into Apocrypha to recover peculiar materials from Quires Wind. I have no understanding why he would want it, but his wishes are my law."
"3952276-0-8696";"An elder scribe left the order to go serve Hermaeus Mora. Normally this is of little consequence, but the scribe in question took several volumes detailing Temple secrets with him."
"3952276-0-8697";"Cultists venerating Hermaeus Mora seek to steal Tribunal secrets. To protect our mysteries, we need to conduct rituals using Dremnaken teeth. \n\nOnly pristine Dremnaken teeth hold the power we need. We will pay well for unbroken samples."
"3952276-0-8698";"There is a place in Apocrypha called Fathoms Drift—a graveyard of ships wrecked by Hermaeus Mora.  We think that some of our order's lost vessels are among those wrecks."
"3952276-0-8699";"One of Lord Vivec's favorite tales is the time he bested Vro-Kuul-Sha the Deepreaver. Well, several Buoyant Armigers went into Apocrypha recently to reenact this great victory. Sadly, they were no match for the creature."
"3952276-0-8700";"One of our scholars was tracking an ancient creature—the Walking Nightmare—in hopes of driving it from these lands. Unfortunately, he got too close and the beast killed him. We need to recover this scholar's notes."
"3952276-0-8701";"Have you heard of Valkynaz Dek? He's a powerful Dremora operating in Apocrypha. Alas, he recently captured some of our investigators."
"3952276-0-8702";"There's an ancient Seeker that haunts the vast libraries of Apocrypha, one that knows everything that is in it. A Prime Cataloger, if you will. We would love some of that knowledge, but we've lost a number of people trying to gain it."
"3952276-0-8703";"Lord Vivec is interested in a powerful arcanist that has risen in Apocrypha. This arcanist, Runemaster Xiomara, grows stronger with each passing day, and many warriors have died at his hands."
"3952276-0-8704";"Corlys the Chainmaker ships exotic creatures into the region and pits them against those willing to pay to fight them. He often lets his beasts loose to drum up interest.\n\nWe want to put Corlys out of business and track his network of suppliers."
"3952276-0-8706";"Can you feel it? I sense an eddy in the temporal flow through Bal Sunnar. I came here to find its source. You know how these things can affect causality.\n\nIf these Telvanni have met us somehow, then I'm too late."
"3952276-0-8707";"Hold your daedrats! I was getting to that.\n\nLeramil the Wise has recovered from her ordeal at the Infinite Panopticon. She eagerly awaits your return. She wants to hear directly from you about Vaermina and Hermaeus Mora. And about the lost memory."
"3952276-0-8714";"I learned that the Numinous Grimoire contains a powerful spell, the Numinous Rite. Cipher Akacirn hopes to defy death forever by performing the rite. But he would become something terrible.\n\nI need your help to stop him, traveler."
"3952276-0-8720";"Hermaeus Mora's enemies assail Apocrypha. Specifically Bastion Nymic—a stronghold where dangerous names of power are stored.\n\nThe Golden Eye needs someone to rout these enemies and the Herald that leads them. The reward will be substantial."

"3952276-0-8723";"Slow down? While the currents of fate rush headlong toward the waterfalls of nonexistence? Not on my watch, mortal!\n\nAfter you allowed Vaermina to enter Apocrypha, whatever she did has upset the balance of reality. We must set things right!"
"3952276-0-8726";"It's a village in the south peninsula. When I heard that the glass mine was reopening, I went there to find employment. I'm a miner by trade and I needed the work.\n\nThey hired me, but instead of mining, they wanted us to build something."
"3952276-0-8727";"Someone from the Temple, a Prelate Faram, closed the Necropolis of Necrom. Said the monks were all sick, some sort of plague.\n\nWe were dismissed like beggars at the city gate, but I didn't believe a word of it!"
"3952276-0-8728";"It's pretty straightforward. Leramil wants you to meet her at Tel Rendys. Something about a contract you signed. She said fate requires her to be there, too, so she'll meet you just outside the tower grounds."
"3952276-0-8729";"I am Master Faras, a supremely talented and severely undervalued mage of House Telvanni. My daughters and I have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of the unknown and have earned precious little recognition.\n\nBut, that ends today!"
"3952276-0-8730";"Daedra in Quires Wind turning against the mortal ciphers there. Ciphers falling into madness, one by one. I fear that some sinister influence is corrupting all within the Wind.\n\nCiphers are scribes, not fighters. Could you help us?"
"3952276-0-8731";"Scruut can provide more information, as it is a vital part of her job. After repairing a thread of fate, she must record the final details in the Chronicle of Apocrypha. Having your name inscribed therein is a great honor."
"3952276-0-8732";"A Daedra. I saw her name scrawled in many margins, but it took the ink attacking for me to put the pieces together. Research can be uncomfortable, even painful. This is unprecedented. I have a plan to combat her, though I lack the skills to enact it."
"3952276-0-8733";"I believe we can siphon the energy of this curse and place it on similarly powerful Telvanni relics. It would wound my father's pride beyond repair if we asked the magisters directly for aid, so I propose we borrow them instead."
"3952276-0-8734";"The curse's fallout was twofold. It bound Master Faras and scattered innumerable pages to the winds. We should do everything we can to keep these secrets out of the hands of the unwitting. It'd be best if you gathered them for us."
"3952276-0-8735";"Superb. I trust you will make the right decision on how to deliver the pages."
"3952276-0-8737";"There's no way to know. Tho'at Replicanum's been running around for far too long. There could be hundreds of her. \n\nBut I know how we can ensure there's one less Tho'at in the archive."

"3952276-0-8741";"Master Malkhest thought you'd ask that. He said—\n\nIt is a near-infinite vault of books, letters, and records. It holds accounts of what has passed and what may never come to be. Currently, it is besieged by an enemy with unknown motives."
"3952276-0-8744";"A secretive and violent order called the Recollection scours ruins throughout the Weald. Strange Daedric creatures harry the region. And the Wood Elf, King Nantharion, reigns over a newly grown forest—a sure sign the threads of fate have frayed."
"3952276-0-8745";"I'm not a greenspeaker or a spinner, but I know a corrupted seed when I see one. If we can trace it to its source, I think we can find the Recollection.\n\nLuckily, there are experts on this sort of thing close by. In the Wood Elf town of Vashabar."
"3952276-0-8746";"I won't know for sure until I finish deciphering Nantharion's notes. But Ithelia is still at large, the Daedric incursions haven't stopped, and Recollection forces are thick as hoarvors on carrion around Ayleid ruins.\n\nThey're looking for something."
"3952276-0-8747";"I thought about finding Nantharion, but nothing happened. Then I remembered that these relics were made to find and defeat Ithelia. So I thought about her and these Daedric runes appeared. I think they translate as the Staff of Many Paths."
"3952276-0-8748";"Shardmarshal Vargas clearly intends to conquer West Weald for her Prince. She made that quite apparent at Feldagard Keep. But there may be another motive for the incursions. If Vargas keeps us busy here, we can't interfere with Ithelia's plans."
"3952276-0-8749";"Instabilities! Places where the threads of fate fray and shred. And it's getting worse! I sense one forming in West Weald even now. But this one feels … different.\n\nAddressing anomalies of fate is my sacred duty, but these scare even me!"
"3952276-0-8750";"You restored the original relics used to capture and imprison Ithelia. And we created the Mirror of Truth to try to show her the monster she has become. All we need to do now is travel to Apocrypha and locate her."
"3952276-0-8751";"Now, much of this is beyond me, but the Great Eye said you need to take the three relics that were used to defeat Ithelia and place them near tears in nexus points in the fabric of reality.\n\nThat should restore the frayed threads of fate."
"3952276-0-8753";"We want to be married. And our fathers, trees take them, won't hear of it. You just saw the backside of an argument we've had many times. This was the last. Clen and I are going to leave, start a new life. \n\nCan … can I ask a favor? I have coin."
"3952276-0-8756";"To protect the estate. I don't know if you're aware, but West Weald isn't the safest place these days. Between the new forest and the Wood Elf settlers to the west, and the rumors of cultists and Daedra stalking the land, I thought it prudent."
"3952276-0-8757";"I cannot discern its origin. Hermaeus Mora gifted me an ability to perceive the threads of fate. This tangle painfully overwhelms that very gift whenever I try to approach the inn.\n\nSomeone without such sight must act as my agent. Namely, you."
"3952276-0-8758";"Greenspeaker Sorilen sent me a letter. Asked me to meet her here. After I arrived, the ground rumbled like an angry timber mammoth. Whole buildings collapsed, trapping people.\n\nWhen the new forest appeared, it damaged the village. This may end it."
"3952276-0-8759";"Narsis Dren, explorer without peer, can always use capable assistants. For my present expedition, I seek an Ayleid treasure, the Emblem of the Last King, in the nearby ruins of Wendir, but the Wood Elves of the Recollection are damaging the site!"
"3952276-0-8761";"It isn't just any auction. It's run by and for vampires. Being a vampire myself, I can't help but wonder why Lord Gallio Valente, vineyard owner and vampire coven leader, wants to sell wine to other vampires. It's not like we partake of the stuff."
"3952276-0-8762";"Daedric forces seek to overwhelm the Legion cohort defending the keep. The legionaries here are capable, but there's something about this attack ….\n\nWe can't let the keep fall. I need to get inside and help them!"
"3952276-0-8763";"Bloodsuckers, pale skins, night hunters. Whatever you call them, this particular crew has left a trail of corpses in their wake. Get too close and your lifeless husk will get added to the heap.\n\nI should know. I used to run with this lot."

"3952276-0-8765";"You rarely hear about solitary necromancers, do you? They always travel in groups. Must be good at making friends.\n\nI'm no match against them, but Master Lucianos is going to rend me into a fine powder if I return empty-handed. Again."
"3952276-0-8766";"The Recollection have flooded the streets with horrid creatures, though I haven't a clue as to how they entered the city. My focus thus far has been on evacuating as many townsfolk as I can.\n\nYou look like the capable sort. Might I enlist your help?"
"3952276-0-8767";"Beasts, rogues, a horrible buzzing. It all happened so fast. Legion's Rest has always been a safe place to spend the night. Ruri, my caravan master, confirmed as much when he scouted ahead, but look at us! \n\nStranger, I desperately need your help."
"3952276-0-8769";"The locals say Nonungalo is haunted. As a priest of Arkay, it is my duty to investigate. I found this poor soul taking her last breaths, raving about a ritual gone wrong and undead necromancers. Please, I need help. I cannot handle this alone."
"3952276-0-8770";"One masked brigand and the pack of horrid beasts she commanded! Fralgatha did everything she could to protect me, bless her heart, but the thief made off with my entire dowry. Now I haven't a napkin ring to present to my future bride."
"3952276-0-8771";"Bandits. Deserters from the war in Cyrodiil who united to pillage the countryside. They appeared in numbers too great for my small cohort of raw recruits to deal with.\n\nI could use someone competent and experienced to help me out."
"3952276-0-8773";"These Goblins are more aggressive than usual. It's almost as if they're getting ready for war. When Goblins fight, they make trouble for everyone.\n\nGoblins aren't stupid though. They wouldn't get this aggressive without a cause."
"3952276-0-8774";"What haven't I lost?\n\nI need you to find Fynboar the Resurrected. A book! It's about a Reachfolk who became the servant of Hermaeus Mora in exchange for a book of necromancy. A horrid practice. All those organs. Very unclean."
"3952276-0-8775";"You helped retrieve the pages, yes. But that's not all a book is. I need a thread, a sharp knife, and a cover. Items with the power to turn these sheets of paper into a book. It's a magical process. \n\nDo you think you could keep an eye out for them?"
"3952276-0-8778";"The Archmagister asked that I not say too much in earshot of my guildmates.\n\nLet's just say it's a magical anomaly. Untamed power from an unknown source. Plenty to catch a mage's interest, but that's just the trouble. It could be highly dangerous."
"3952276-0-8779";"In Hermaeus Mora's realm of Apocrypha, there is a door that must not be opened. A secret, forgotten for millennia. But a Dremora named Torvesard remembers.\n\nHe is determined to open that door. If he succeeds, reality itself could be undone."
"3952276-0-8780";"It's a tiring ordeal. I'm visiting West Weald to execute the will of my late aunt, Lady Weatherleah. The will my aunt's beloved dog Betu currently has in his slobbery little mouth.\n\nNo thanks to Lady Weatherleah's investigator friend."
"3952276-0-8781";"My commanding officer, Tribune Alea Idolus, sent a cohort to guard Rustwall. With the recent troubles plaguing the Weald, she didn't want to chance an enemy gaining a foothold this close to Skingrad.\n\nBut we arrived to find not a single legionary!"
"3952276-0-8782";"Shining beasts and deranged cultists have invaded the town. Baroness Eliana Cossa sent out anyone fit enough to run and find aid. She's trying to help those still trapped, but she can't do it herself."
"3952276-0-8783";"Orc clans know better than to attack the Oathsworn Pit. It goes against our codes. Some Elves don't know how to respect codes. I want to show them why they should. Violently.\n\nThe Oathsworn are renowned warriors, but they'll need our help here."
"3952276-0-8785";"Followers of Malacath sent word that their home, the Oathsworn Pit, is under attack. I fought some Oathsworn, they're not weaklings. But they think the Undaunted are misguided. \n\nHelp them take their pit back, and show them what the Undaunted can do."
"3952276-0-8787";"I need someone to gather venom from crystaljack wasps for our alchemists to study. The foul insects have recently infested Legion's Rest.\n\nInitial reports indicate that the wasps create venom crystals. Those should be easy to find and transport."
"3952276-0-8788";"I have reports that Spinner Urthrendir of the Recollection has started a ritual deep in the encroaching jungle. We don't know the purpose of the ritual, but we're pretty sure we don't want him to complete it and find out."
"3952276-0-8789";"West Weald is under attack! Daedric incursions from a realm called Mirrormoor are laying waste to the countryside. As soon as the West Weald Legion repels one incursion, Mirrormoor's forces launch a new one somewhere else.\n\nWe need help."
"3952276-0-8790";"A contingent of workers borrowed high-quality tools from the Legion storehouse for use at Haldain Lumber Camp. They were to be returned once the camp's supplies arrived, but we've had no word.\n\nI need someone to go and retrieve the tools."
"3952276-0-8792";"Root around in rubble and retrieve any Reachfolk trinkets you can find. It seems that during Varen Aquilarios's uprising to claim the Ruby Throne, Leovic requested aid from the Reachfolk. One such clan met its end at what is now called Varen's Watch."
"3952276-0-8793";"It's a delicate matter, I'm afraid. I was tasked with preparing invitations for Count Calantius's upcoming gala and the printer made a grievous mistake.\n\nWe must destroy those insidious invitations before anyone notices the calamitous error."
"3952276-0-8794";"Are you familiar with the tharriker? It's a relatively recent addition to the Weald's wildlife. Not sure where it comes from, but it appeared shortly after the southwestern transformation.\n\nI need someone to find out more about these creatures."
"3952276-0-8795";"The Legion plans to renovate the ruins of Nonungalo and turn them into an armory. \n\nI need someone to enter the ruins and take note of any hostile creatures, hazards, or other dangers before we send laborers in there to begin the work."
"3952276-0-8796";"We learned about a strange Daedric creature our scouts called Stri the Fate-Eater making a lair in a cave far to the north of Skingrad. We sent a squad of legionaries to deal with the monster, but they never returned."
"3952276-0-8797";"Legion scouts spotted a group of Goblins setting up camp at Centurion's Rise to the northwest. If you can believe it, they think the foolish creatures are attempting to train dangerous tharrikers! \n\nI need someone to deal with this situation."
"3952276-0-8798";"I'm not sure if you're aware, but West Weald has been inundated with Daedra the likes of which we've never seen before. One such monstrosity is the crystalline entity we call Hessedaz the Baleful. I need someone to gather allies and deal with it."
"3952276-0-8799";"Have you heard of the Recollection? Some sort of cult or militant society? They're causing all sorts of problems in the Weald and we finally got a lead on some of their leaders, but I don't have any legionaries available at the moment."
"3952276-0-8800";"Ever visit Lake Olo to the east? It's a favorite relaxation spot for nobles and our wealthy citizens. Even Count Calantius is known to frequent the location.\n\nWell, an aggression of root called Oakenclaw has taken residence in the lake."
"3952276-0-8838";"I'd prefer the Blind Path invaded the arenas of Maelstrom. Then I could really test their strength. \n\nBedlam Veil isn't equipped to host combat. It houses my trinkets—small mementos of war and glorious memories which are best left undisturbed."
"3952276-0-8840";"Whenever Fa-Nuit-Hen contacts us, it's usually because one of the Undaunted caught their eye. But this sounds different. The Bedlam Veil, a section of Fa-Nuit-Hen's realm is being invaded by Blind Path Cultists."
"3952276-0-8841";"Right to business? Of course.\n\nTribune Alea and Beragon await your arrival at the Wood Elf's townhouse in Skingrad. He fears that Nantharion and the Recollection are about to do something terrible, but he may have a way to find them."
"3952276-0-8844";"That … I'm still not privy to. All I know is that the tribune wants you back at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad so you can listen to whatever the Wood Elf has to say."
"3952276-0-8845";"Not part of the Terror's gang? Good. Still, doesn't mean I want to show you my neck just yet. If you came to feed, you'll find slim pickings in Sutch. These vampires have already had their fill.\n\nThey're worse than when I ran with them. Much worse."
"3952276-0-8846";"Ostumir. It used to be lovely. Then that horrid jungle sprang out of nowhere and drove us out. We wanted to reclaim our homes, but I don't see that happening now. Not with so many dead.\n\nOh, I do hope that nice Wood Elf found more survivors."
"3952276-0-8847";"Narsis left some time ago to explore the ruins of Wendir. I fear he may be in trouble. He is trying to recover an Ayleid treasure, the Emblem of the Last King. Could you help him? He'll reward your efforts."
"3952276-0-8849";"In Hermaeus Mora's realm of Apocrypha, there is a door that must not be opened. A secret, forgotten for millennia. But a Dremora named Torvesard remembers.\n\nHe is determined to open that door. If he succeeds, reality itself could be undone."
"3952276-0-8851";"In Hermaeus Mora's realm of Apocrypha, there is a door that must not be opened. A secret, forgotten for millennia. But a Dremora named Torvesard remembers.\n\nHe is determined to open that door. If he succeeds, reality itself could be undone."
"3952276-0-8868";"What other explanation is there? My father Ulbren was town constable. He wrote to me about investigating some suspicious deaths, then suddenly I get a letter telling me he had died.\n\nI requested leave from the Legion and returned as fast as I could."
"3952276-0-8875";"You'd think so, right? But so far all Hyacinth will tell me is that he's too busy for my antics. And Wisteria threatened to punch me if I didn't leave it be. So I decided to go over their heads and finally got an invitation from the Gardener himself!"
"3952276-0-8876";"Sounds like Snapdragon and the Gardener have been going around and around, just like old times. But they must be making progress. Now Snapdragon wants us to meet her and collect her research. \n\nHere, you hold onto the letter. For safekeeping."
"3952276-0-8877";"The letter's from Snapdragon, by way of a banker in Marbruk. She left behind instructions that in the event of her death, I was to inherit a locked coffer.\n\nA coffer that the banker says she gave to the bank for safekeeping a week before her death."
"3952276-0-8878";"To prepare our renowned Jubilee Cakes for the new season, of course!\n\nApologies. I'm Mogh, apprentice to my father, the patron of pies himself—Chef Donolon! But thanks to those vultures, there may not be any cakes this time around."
"3952276-0-8880";"It blazed with blue soulfire, burning the sky as it fell toward Moonmont. The signs could not be more clear. I wanted to investigate, but High Cantor Viti forbade me."
"3952276-0-8882";"The tears in the fabric of reality! I can't imagine what that exactly means or fathom all of the implications, but Leramil is convinced that sending Ithelia away only resolved the ongoing situation."
"3952276-0-8884";"You passed some of my trusted associates when we entered Sunnamere. I want them tasked to investigate and catalog what we find. \n\nIn the meantime, you're our resident expert on Scribing. You need to learn everything you can."
"3952276-0-8887";"Leramil says it's time to once again take up the chase! She wants to resume the search for Ithelia and Torvesard.\n\nAs I understand it, every moment the Forgotten Prince remains free is another moment closer to the end of everything we know."
"3952276-0-8888";"The noted explorer Narsis Dren has gone to investigate the ruins of Wendir, and I fear he may be in trouble. He left some time ago to procure an Ayleid relic, the Emblem of the Last King. Could you go and help him? He will reward your efforts."
"3952276-0-8895";"West Weald is under attack! Daedric incursions from a realm called Mirrormoor are laying waste to the countryside. As soon as the West Weald Legion repels one incursion, Mirrormoor's forces launch a new one somewhere else.\n\nWe need help."
"3952276-0-8896";"My uncle, Octavius, is going to hire some hunters to cull the Goblins. But the Goblins haven't done anything deserving a full cull yet.\n\nPim says there's a reason for the Goblins' behavior and I believe her."
"3952276-0-8899";"Almo and Regnir. Comrades in my Legion days, then fellow outlaws after. We called ourselves the Scarlets.\n\nSorry. The name's Hooke. Back when the Gold Road was rich, I led the gang. But we got caught. Did our time. We're not thieves anymore."
"3952276-0-8900";"I assume it concerns the Rajaska. The singers we faced that were turned into dro-m'Athra by the power of dark songs.\n\nBetter that than the Inquisitors or that high cantor. They see my very existence as some sort of heresy."
"3952276-0-8904";"Well, yes. Marcien's a dear friend. If they were going to be late they would've sent word. \n\nTheir trade takes them to many remote and isolated parts of the wilderness. If something happened to them, there wouldn't be anyone around to help."
"3952276-0-8905";"Neletai recognized their leader as a Dremora called Xoryn. Apparently, his goal is the same as ours. Somewhere within the citadel is the arcane knot—a deeply unstable and mysterious object."
"3952276-0-8906";"<I took this strangely glowing bottle from Xoryn's things. Keshargo will want to see this since it might have a connection to the arcane knot.>"
"3952276-0-8907";"<I pulled this piece of Living Glass from Xoryn's armor. Strange lights seem to dance inside it. Keshargo will want to see this.>"
"3952276-0-8908";"It's an ancient Daedric fortress buried in the sands of Fargrave. \n\nWe thought we were the only ones there, but we were wrong. It all happened so quickly. I hope you can help them."
"3952276-0-8909";"I was leading a patrol, hunting Daedra, when one of my own legionaries attacked me! An Orc named Ulrath. Such traitorous behavior endangered us all!\n\nSince I'm injured, could you locate whatever remains of my squadron? For mercenary pay, of course."
"3952276-0-8910";"That's complicated. The tribune was on her way to Feldagard Keep. Said she had to check on something there. But she specifically sent me to find you and deliver these orders."
"3952276-0-8911";"She did not. My hope is the high cantor finally sees that we have a common enemy. More likely, this is a trap. I do not wish to step into it unprepared. And I would like to avoid bloodshed if possible. It would hardly be a fair fight.\n\nFor them."
"3952276-0-8913";"Recently the count's entourage was investigating the nearby devastation when twisted creatures attacked us. The count escaped, but his pet bear cub, Lord Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits, who we just call Burnbiscuit, fled deeper into the region."
"3952276-0-8914";"Obviously. Though I hoped it would go better.\n\nI was experimenting with the reflective Daedric magic in this region. I always loved mirrors. During my studies, I fractured my personality, freeing my emotions to run amok. I haven't felt right since."
"3952276-0-8915";"It is, and beyond lies your final trial to restore the Scholarium. Your proctor for this test shall be me. \n\nAs you may have already guessed, I am the last Luminary who might lend their power to the Scribing Altar."
"3952276-0-8916";"Zhanlaj Khenarthi. Khenarthi's Rise. It fell to ruin during my time. I expect it is ruins still.\n\nPerhaps we will find something there to help us defeat Ravith-morna. To keep her from waking her moon beast and putting all Khajiit souls in peril."
"3952276-0-8917";"Well, it's not like the tribune shares all the details with a mere legionary. All I know is what I was given in my orders. And that she promised to compensate you for your assistance."
"3952276-0-8918";"Existence is breaking down around us and you want a recapitulation? Fine. The Daedric Prince Ithelia has absorbed so much power that she's causing reality to fall apart! But you restored the relics and we crafted the Mirror of Truth. Remember now?"
"3952276-0-8926";"Hollowjack, Daedric Lord of Fear, has manifested his power in Nirn this Witches Festival. Lord Hollowjack feeds on the terror he inspires in mortals, crippling them. Lives are at stake, my friend. He's claimed at least three Haunted that I know of."
"3952276-0-8930";"Kill a Marauder. \n\nI'd do it myself, but the Index won't let specters enter the Archival Wings. You're alive. You can enter the archive and exact my revenge."
"3952276-0-8933";"The Ayleids and their connection to the Daedra. I believe there's more to it than the Dawnway teaches us. Part of my research involves studying Ayleid remnants, but they're scattered across West Weald and I'm scraping for time. Can you help?"
"3952276-0-8934";"Sure as acorns fall. You bundle Ayleid remnants found across West Weald, and I write about them as fast as my hand allows it. At the pace we're going, I'm certain I'll be able to finish my book about the Ayleids and the Daedra in no time."
"3952276-0-8936";"You could start by making those Fabled maligraphies wish they'd never crawled out of their books. I'd kill them myself, but the Index won't let me enter the archival wings.\n\nKnowing that there are Fabled out there makes me want to punch a wall!"
"3952276-0-8938";"I'll take that as a no. \n\nSoldiers from every alliance are disappearing across Cyrodiil. Their trails lead here. The alliance generals think they have a deserter problem, but at this scale? No, the Albuses are killing the missing soldiers."
"3952276-0-8940";"We have word that there's something odd going on in Cyrodiil. Soldiers and generals going missing from every alliance. Odd magical phenomena. Whispers of a secret fortress called the Exiled Redoubt. That sort of thing."
"3952276-0-8941";"The true ruler of Tamriel, if you believe his army. But the alliance leaders will never accept his claim. Which is why he wants our Elder Scroll. \n\nHe thinks it holds a prophecy that will force the alliances to bend the knee."
"3952276-0-8943";"Some war hero claiming to be the true emperor just attacked an island near Hew's Bane. It sounds like Orpheon the Tactician thinks there's an Elder Scroll on the island that will back up his claim to the Ruby Throne."
"3952276-0-8944";"It's as I feared. Our defeat of Lord Hollowjack was only temporary. He's gathered his strength once again and will come for us if we don't act quickly!"
"3952276-0-8953";"Oh this? Just an average day for me. But say … if you help me out of this ice, I'll tell you all about it. \n\nI'll happily pass some coin your way, too. For the inconvenience. Please?"
"3952276-0-9009";"So far, distinctive clues elude us and no one has claimed credit for the attacks.\n\nAt this rate, they could destroy the guild before we learn anything. It's the biggest crisis since the Planemeld, but without Merric, I'm not sure how to proceed."
"3952276-0-9032";"No one has claimed credit for the attacks and evidence has been lacking. It makes no sense.\n\nStill, I expect more and more attacks at any time. Without Master Merric, our guild could fall. It's our biggest crisis since the Planemeld."
"3952276-0-9039";"The note we discovered talked about a Worm Nest on the northern coast of Rivenspire. We must gather our forces, storm their lair, and deal with the Worm Cult leader, Mezamma."
"3952276-0-9040";"Prince Azah hired you to help find Guildmaster Merric and discover who was behind the attacks on the guilds. You found out that the Worm Cult had returned and stood with Azah when Merric died.\n\nHe trusts you. And so do I."
"3952276-1-467";"The infirmary is below the Great Hall. Speak to the healer there, Odette. Get her assessment of his condition.  \n\nAgain, I would plead with you—if his actions are truly driven by madness—show mercy."
"3952276-1-521";"To cleanse the shrine, you need to get glow dust from the wisps on the eastern shore. That, and the rare mineral, <<z:1>>, from the northern hills.\n\nCleanse the shrine and pray for Azura's guidance. She will send it."
"3952276-1-575";"I suppose you must. But be warned, the Night Terror takes many forms and has countless methods of inflicting pain and fear. No wonder the king suffers so. \n\nHurry then. Azura be with you, friend."
"3952276-1-657";"""I stole a gem from the Bitterhand Bandits, but they caught me and will soon kill me. If you are reading this, please, fulfill my last wish. Take the gem to Ozalan in Hoarfrost Downs and trade it for Fadeel's freedom.""\n\n-Handre"
"3952276-1-736";"Sir Croix and others are making preparations for the attack even now. We must stop them. \n\nI know some of the other knights in the keep share our concerns, but I have been banned. I need someone to go in and rally knights to our cause."
"3952276-1-974";"The damned Bloodthorn cult! With Camlorn in chaos and the Duke out of action, who knows what the cult intends?\n\nAt least the Lion Guard finally arrived. Speak to Lieutenant Harim if you want to help. Last I heard he was near the lighthouse."
"3952276-1-1294";"Why? I want my spellbook back, and I want to flay him alive. \n\nYou can search for him, or his brother might know where he is. Dithis favors the tavern nearby. Oh, and please don't mention the flaying."
"3952276-1-1341";"A necklace. A necklace made of ogre teeth, with big wide bands, packed with more teeth than you can count.\n\nI've got two sacks of them here at the camp but I need more. The more the better. Help me and I'll help you."
"3952276-1-1346";"The Ironhands have been using a cavern to get through the mountains.\n\nI sent a mining team to collapse the cavern, but they never reported back. Find them and help them get it done. After that, we can clean up what's left."
"3952276-1-1383";"She was a Wood Elf—she loved nature, flowers. If you could get some fallen blossoms to put in her hair.\n\nAnd her favorite meal—mudcrab and the Wayside Inn's house wine. You'd actually get these for us?"
"3952276-1-1384";"That's the thing. It was my adventuring band that founded this plantation. The mage, Dro-Dara put up the gold, but we all decided to retire here.\n\nBad idea. I just want to leave now, but the bandits are holding my companions. They need help."
"3952276-1-1437";"We've been trying to break through the ogre lines for days. Sergeant Olfin is leading the charge.\n\nIf you can help him take the tower up on the rocks, we can establish a forward command post. Then we're in striking distance to finish this thing."
"3952276-1-1485";"To their spawning pools. Arcady might still be alive!"
"3952276-1-1489";"Yeah. Yeah! That's a great idea! I need my shipment back. For the selling.\n\nCan you get the wine back frumma camp over there? And bring it here? To me?"
"3952276-1-1527";"He tagged along behind the dreugh to make sure they disposed of me. I guess he just got too close. \n\nServes him right, the rat."
"3952276-1-1536";"Take this bucket! If you can get to the well and fill it …. I don't know any other way.\n\nThe larger fire may not be so easy—just focus on the smaller fires first."
"3952276-1-1554";"Yes. You have a hearing problem? Territory markers. They use them to mark their territory.\n\nThe Goblins set them up at the north tower, the south tower, and the eastern gate. I'll stay and keep this gate secure."
"3952276-1-1568";"That totem needs to come down, and quick. \n\nI ought to send Rama, but it's probably smarter to keep him here under arrest. My troops are stretched thin. Can you run up and take down the totem? Bring it back here to me."
"3952276-1-1591";"Take these poultices. It should at least help them get on their feet so they can get to safety."
"3952276-1-1633";"You have more urgent work to do. The Dream Shard must be returned to Abbot Durak at Pariah Abbey.\n\nI sense that Vaermina's not yet done with Stormhaven. The Spirit Wardens will need the Shard to oppose her."
"3952276-1-1637";"Well, my sailors are locked up in a cave behind the town, but the slavers' leader, Ma'jhad Kha, keeps the key in a house he's commandeered. \n\nSo you'll need to steal the key first, then go down and free the guys. I guess it's not that simple, is it?"
"3952276-1-1639";"I'm glad you're in this with me. We must stop the Dreamers and if there is another Omen, we must destroy it. \n\nI leave now for Shinji's Scarp in Gavaudon. I want you there too, but first, I need you to warn High King Emeric."
"3952276-1-1678";"I am certainly eager to explain the situation further, but do you think we could continue the conversation over by the bridge?"
"3952276-1-1709";"Then you have to go! They're doing the same thing to her they wanted to do to me, but worse!\n\nThere's something about that scroll …. Please, get that scroll and find a way to pull her back. You have to!"
"3952276-1-1735";"The Spirit Wardens of Pariah Abbey. They dabble in Daedric rituals, but they are benevolent.\n\nSpeak to Brother Muran at the abbey. Ask him if the appearance of this Omen should be cause for wider concerns. If so, we should warn High King Emeric."
"3952276-1-2016";"I warn most against entering <<1>>. But you might help us in our resistance. Go to the alchemist's shop in town. You'll find like-minded people there.\n\nThe Imperials won't let you pass in peace, but any of their blood spilt blesses the sand."
"3952276-1-2017";"Not what, but whom. I've set up a meeting with someone who may know the identity of the traitor. I'd like you to talk to her.\n\nMy contact's at the tavern, just as I requested. She'll be reading a book. See what she knows, but be careful."
"3952276-1-2018";"Seek <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Their peril is our opportunity. I'm sure they'd rather work with us than with the Imperials.\n\nAsk about, search houses, but above all, be discreet."
"3952276-1-2046";"They're trying to open more portals here and there. We need to stop that—but I have to go try to save Master Muzgu.\n\nCan you kill some Scamps and hurl their heads into the incomplete portals? The magical feedback should shut them down."
"3952276-1-2068";"Dreughside is part of Baron Sorick's fief, but he refuses to send any soldiers. It's crazy.\n\nWe have to stop this before any more citizens get themselves killed. It would help if we got these eggs out of Dreughside and back to the pools."
"3952276-1-2130";"If there is, I certainly do not know them, but we must make sure King Fahara'jad is aware of the situation. \n\nWith this chaos, I cannot leave my post. I wonder, would you be willing to deliver this news to the palace?"
"3952276-1-2146";"Undoubtedly, they hope to steal the Ansei Wards. With the wards, Uwafa and Alasan could become unimaginably powerful. And that would be disastrous.\n\nNo matter the risks, we must try to stop them. Let's return to the palace and consult with my father."
"3952276-1-2161";"Of course not! \n\nListen. You have to help me. You have to find that wench and make her change me back! It was the Khajiit potion maker, Unishi. She's in the tavern. Please—you have to."
"3952276-1-2184";"Oh … Tu'whacca will do the cleansing. We must only clear the way.\n\nIf you will help me light the sacred braziers, Tu'whacca will send his Breath to help us destroy the Withered Hand and return the dead to the sand."
"3952276-1-2187";"Thank you. This is no small thing I ask, and I appreciate you stepping up. \n \nThe three graves I need you to check belong to <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. They changed the course of history. They deserve to rest now."
"3952276-1-2192";"Uwafa has sealed himself inside the Sanctum with my priests. I fear for them, but Tu'whacca will help us. He will unseal the doors … then you can go in and kill this necromancer bastard.\n\nAre you ready to witness the power of a god, my friend?"
"3952276-1-2193";"There is a great scholar in Bergama. Her name is Zohreh. She knows much about the Ansei Wards. She may have the answers we seek.\n\nWherever you go, Tu'whacca will be with you. Of that I am certain."
"3952276-1-2222";"I do not know, but I fear they plan something terrible.\n\nPrince Azah and his men are barricaded in the warehouse at the eastern edge of town. He may have learned more about what these fiends are planning. You should go to him."
"3952276-1-2240";"I am sure of nothing, but this is my suggestion for where you should begin your search.\n\nThere is a wise woman in HoonDing's Watch—Priestess Sermenh. Perhaps she can give you more insight."
"3952276-1-2251";"Oh. That is very kind of you to offer, but my administration has a handle on the situation. I believe Justice Istah and his officers have some promising leads. \n\nYou are a guest here. It would not do for us to put you to work."
"3952276-1-2344";"Take this antidote. I fear some of them may have been poisoned by the snakes and now lack the strength to escape.\n\nI hope it is not too late."
"3952276-1-2356";"To teach you. If you are to be champion of the Alik'r, you must understand the spirit of this desert and its people.\n\nTu'whacca says you must walk in the steps of our heroes, battle the spirits of the enemies they faced. Then you will understand."
"3952276-1-2403";"It is not just Shiri. It is the text she found at Tava's Blessing. Scholar Zohreh says it must be kept away from the Withered Hand!\n\nShiri has a cousin in Satakalaam—Nahirah. Please, you must go and see if Shiri is there."
"3952276-1-2408";"The Ash'abah often spend this season camping at Morwha's Bounty to the south. Gods willing, perhaps they are still there. \n\nMarimah sent his daughter to warn me of the Withered Hand. They wanted to help. I regret that I turned them away."
"3952276-1-2438";"""In that same spirit, I would like to pose a challenge of wits for Donel to claim his inheritance. The clue to begin the challenge is this: \n\n'After day turns to night, you must follow the light.'\n\nGood luck my son. I am proud of you."""
"3952276-1-2457";"You are! \n\nCould you check the west gate for survivors? I heard fighting from that direction."
"3952276-1-2458";"The smuggler bosses are in the counting house back of the docks. After you've doped the barrels, search the counting house for clues as to where Miranda's being held. \n\nWith luck, we might be able to rescue Miranda without a fight."
"3952276-1-2459";"I need a carrot to tempt them and a stick to threaten them. You seem fearless—see if you can collect some jewels hidden in the houses, and puffball caps from a crate on the docks.\n\nOnce you've got all that, meet me near the boathouse."
"3952276-1-2479";"I'm a powerful Spirit Warden. If the Daedric spirit possesses me, it will combine my power with its own.\n\nI would become a danger to everyone in Stormhaven. You need to kill me before that happens."
"3952276-1-2521";"Midnight Union is very different in recent days. S'rashi's boss is not so patient. S'rashi needs gold fast.\n\nThis one cannot help his brother anymore, but you will go see S'rashi upstairs in the inn, yes? Offer to help him, yes? He will pay."
"3952276-1-2522";"She's locked herself up in the house we were staying in. I knocked on the door. I even begged her to come.\n\nYou think you could try to persuade her? Her name is Marlene."
"3952276-1-2523";"I've put him for safekeeping in the guest house across the courtyard. \n\nI'd welcome him at our celebration, but he spurns us. Even a son can stand only so much."
"3952276-1-2524";"There must be some form of communication between her and the Supernals.\n\nIf you can find, say, letters from the cult to Adima, I could use them to clear Hosni's name when this is all over. I'd suggest searching their camp on the beach."
"3952276-1-2525";"Adima's been giving my son potions. If you can figure out which one puts him into dreaming sleep—and take some yourself—I think you'll be able to enter his dreams, as she does.\n\nTalk to Hosni's bard, Destane. He's in on all Hosni's secrets."
"3952276-1-2584";"Ah, this one would be most grateful. After so many years, Dro-Dara just doesn't have the heart to break everyone's dreams.\n\nYou could talk to Knarstygg? He'll have better listening if it comes from you anyways."
"3952276-1-2585";"No. The count died years ago, and she's been in charge ever since. Of course, every eligible man in Stormhaven has come calling, trying to court her, but she doesn't like them, or hasn't married at least.\n\nPlease, can you just talk to her?"
"3952276-1-2587";"Right again. Complicating matters further, King Aphren's Sword was shattered into three parts. Legend says it can only be reforged in King Aphren's tomb. \n\nIf you're brave enough to find the pieces and get them reforged, there will be a reward."
"3952276-1-2588";"I certainly have. Why would I share my land, my bed, with such fobbing louts?\n\nNow one of my suitors apparently seeks to take me out of the picture. Mathias will know which suitor dropped off the mirror.\n\nWould you help me investigate this?"
"3952276-1-2602";"And we need to do it fast. Problem is the slavers took the focusing crystals and all my oil.\n\nSome of it is still on the island, but they also put some on their ship!"
"3952276-1-2613";"I hope so. The sorcerous undead on the hill have captured some of the locals who strayed too near. I tried to save them, but was driven back by the hideous, heinous power of their benighted ….\n\nAnyway, I was driven back."
"3952276-1-2614";"The Lord of Coldharbour! Molag Bal! The necromancers plan to place us where they can spy on his enemies. Even now, he looks upon you through me!\n\nGather the cursed skulls. Cast us upon the charnel heap in the tower. End our torment."
"3952276-1-2616";"My mission is clear. No one from the Redguard camp allowed in the castle. I'm a Knight of the Flame and I will enforce that directive to my dying breath.\n\nSir Hughes is the head of our order. If you have concerns, speak to him inside the castle."
"3952276-1-2617";"Don't I deserve a proper burial? A final resting place?\n\nAt the entrance to the mine is a small shrine. If my bones could just be buried there, away from the monsters that killed me .... I think I could find some solace in that."
"3952276-1-2620";"Just that I arrived in town right before the attack. It's absurd. \n\nNerves are on edge at the castle so I was sent to help protect the village. A messenger should've arrived ahead of me, but Constable Pascal says he never received the message."
"3952276-1-2622";"He says that securing the town comes first, but the town seems perfectly secure to me!\n\nSomeone has to help my baby!"
"3952276-1-2625";"If you want to waste your time, I won't argue, but we're packing up and leaving.\n\nMy daughter Ganise is over there sifting through the ashes. Would you mind telling her to come back to the house?"
"3952276-1-2626";"Yes. Missus Nurin and Ganise … they won't give up, but we've been looking all day. \n\nHe's gone, probably dead, and I'm not sticking around to join him. If you want to help, talk to Missus Nurin."
"3952276-1-2630";"My thoughts exactly. And in so doing, you would win her confidence. \n\nYou already helped get the envoy through the gates, so Lakana will be inclined to trust you. Go speak with her upstairs. Do whatever you must to learn her plans."
"3952276-1-2637";"Perhaps, but by sealing the cave, my fellow knights succeeded where I did not. The Three starved here in darkness.\n\nBut now the cave is reopened and their spirits again threaten the land. You must put their spirits to rest."
"3952276-1-2647";"My thoughts exactly, and I'd like to go out and do it myself ….\n\nI wouldn't want Ganise to lose both her parents. I think it might be smarter if you go. If you're willing, that is."
"3952276-1-2655";"Until I hear a better explanation, yes. But my opinion is inconsequential. I simply follow the orders I'm given.\n\nDame Falhut has forbidden us to allow any of the Alik'r into the castle. If you have further questions, she is at the main gate."
"3952276-1-2656";"<This writing is illegible, save for the last entry.>\n\n""Eight forgive us! To stop The Three, we were forced to bury Sir Edain in the cave along with our enemies. We were following orders, but that made the task no less difficult."""
"3952276-1-3073";"I fear he is either dead or taken captive. We were attacked by so many, so fast … I tried to find him, but to no avail. I came back to catch my breath.\n\nWith you here, though … I am willing to try again. If you are … that is."
"3952276-1-3076";"<The man's valuables have been taken, but a scrap of parchment remains. It appears to be a note.>"
"3952276-1-3077";"I need someone who can get in quietly, grab some wolf's woe, and take it to the hostages. With that plant, the hostages can walk out without attracting the attention of the wolves.\n\nThe hostages are locked in a house, so you also need to find a key."
"3952276-1-3078";"Not my call. You should talk to Captain Farlivere. She's on the road west of the camp."
"3952276-1-3083";"I know! Take my hunting horn. It's upstairs. Then clear the traps and create a diversion. Set something on fire. That should keep the Red Rooks too busy to notice us.\n\nSound the horn to signal us that it's safe. Meanwhile, I'll untie the others."
"3952276-1-3084";"The bandit leader, an Orc named Tharkul. He took it. The box only opens if you're a member of the family. I told him but he didn't care. \n\nIf you retrieve it, I can arrange a reward."
"3952276-1-3085";"Good. Talk to Sasana at-Abbas. She oversees the docks. Tell her what you discovered and she'll help in any way she can.\n\nNow hurry. The King's life is in danger."
"3952276-1-3089";"Our purpose now is just to get these people out of here. My sisters and I can figure everything else out later.\n\nI can construct a ward to protect the villagers, but my oath prevents me from harming these creatures. I'm at a loss."
"3952276-1-3090";"I don't know. There might be a way to help the other villagers. A group of women showed up as we fled. Threw spells around and called themselves the wyrd sisters.\n\nThey helped us escape. Maybe they know what's going on out there."
"3952276-1-3091";"They said to take it up with the magistrate, but that takes too long. Poor Glutton doesn't have that much time. \n\nI need someone to rescue him before he becomes a ham sandwich!"
"3952276-1-3093";"My sister Olyna is still out there, probably trapped somewhere between the fires and the enraged forest creatures.\n\nThe fires burn, our sister is missing, and the villagers are dying. Something needs to be done."
"3952276-1-3094";"Gloria says this amulet can be used to reveal the hidden werewolves. I'm sure she can tell you more about it."
"3952276-1-3098";"Start in the trade district alleys. That's where Old Gianne was murdered just yesterday. \n\nMaybe Lieutenant Dubois will give you a reward if you do his job for him."
"3952276-1-3099";"Talk to Sergeant Armoil. His soldiers faced werewolves in Camlorn and they captured one of the beasts. He can advise you.\n\nThen meet Gloria in the cave to the east, across the bay. That's where she'll perform the rite to learn how to defeat Faolchu."
"3952276-1-3105";"My wife, Rosalind, took up her sword. I should have trusted her, but I hid and prayed. A darker voice than Stendarr's answered me. And the town paid the price.\n\nWill you walk my wife's path? If you fight as she did, perhaps you can lift this curse."
"3952276-1-3107";"Yes, you deserve the truth. Molag Bal turned Rosalind into a vengeful shade. He turned her into the tormentor of the people she fought so hard to protect. \n\nThe sword might remind her who she really is. If not, you must destroy her and set us free."
"3952276-1-3109";"One of the cultists said something about a hag coven. I don't want to think about what that might mean for my sister. Poor Bethany!  \n\nI sent the other men to the wyress camp nearby. The wyresses were kind enough to help us after the attack."
"3952276-1-3112";"Elemental spirits connected to the Wyrd Tree. They guide us in protecting the land.\n\nBut if we cannot reach them, they cannot aid us. I must ask for your continued help in this. All of Glenumbra may be at risk if this blight continues to spread."
"3952276-1-3113";"Sarvith, our Master of Incunabula, hopes to evoke a vision that shows us the events surrounding Faolchu's death. \n\nWe're collecting the most powerful historic artifacts to use as focus objects. The spirits are making the task difficult, however."
"3952276-1-3122";"You'll need this charm to defeat her, for she can siphon vitality from even the strongest foe. Kill the lesser hags and drain their power into this charm.  \n\nBut use the charm only when Murk tries to siphon your life force. Don't waste its power."
"3952276-1-3124";"Our leader, Guy LeBlanc, heard them talking about a coven. That means witches! And trouble! \n\nMaybe you could talk to LeBlanc. He's around here somewhere. We could sure use the help. We are way out of our element out here."
"3952276-1-3128";"It was the Bloodthorns. \n\nOh, poor Poppa. I left everything behind. I don't even have his dear old pipe to remember him by. If I just had that one small thing, maybe I could find some comfort."
"3952276-1-3137";"You won't just see a vision of the past, you'll live through it. What you do may change the destiny of those around you. \n\nThis is a terrible burden to carry, but it's the only way to get the information you seek. When you're ready, put on the armor."
"3952276-1-3144";"The Bloodthorn drain our wills. If you recover the regalia they stole and return it to the crypts, it will restore our leaders. They are strong spirits and our joined wills can resist the cultists.\n\nI sense the regalia. It is still nearby."
"3952276-1-3159";"Slay these Bloodthorn cultists. Rescue the spirits they are trying to enslave. \n\nTo my great sorrow, Sir Granden has already heeded their evil call. Find his tomb to the east and destroy him. When that is done, find me on the monument hill."
"3952276-1-3160";"I don't know. You're not one of us. But we have to try something, I suppose.\n\nSee the lurchers out there? Gather their limbs. That's the dangerous part. Then burn the limbs at the altar atop the nearby ruins. If it works, a guardian should appear."
"3952276-1-3163";"Of course! The standing stones! I should have realized. Take my amulet and protect the wyrd. \n\nWhen they're done, weaken a lurcher and use the amulet to control it. Bring the controlled lurcher to the standing stones on the hill. We'll do the rest."
"3952276-1-3164";"Good. Help Shaza clear a path and fight your way to General Mandin at the western gate. We'll rally the troops there and turn the tide of the war.\n\nFor a little while, anyway."
"3952276-1-3172";"The leader of the Red Rooks took it. He's a hulking Orc named Tharkul. The box only opens if you're part of the family. I told him that, but he refused to listen.\n\nIf you happen to retrieve the box, it would be worth a lot to me."
"3952276-1-3184";"The Lion Guard doesn't usually seek help outside its ranks, but these are desperate times. Do what you can to help any patrols you encounter.\n\nAnd if you run into Mage Benele, maybe you can help her out, as well."
"3952276-1-3209";"I wouldn't know. I've been relieved of duty. The Lion Guard has taken over the investigation. One of their officers, a Lieutenant Harim, went to scout out the lighthouse. \n\nOh, what if the Duke has been killed? How will I be able to live with that?"
"3952276-1-3270";"Politics. Always the problem here. The Magistrate is a Forebear, and the Crowns say she is incompetent. Neither side trusts the other. It creates quite a mess.\n\nYou want to help? Speak to the Magistrate in the Hall of Judgment. I'm leaving."
"3952276-1-3280";"Tiela is like a duneripper in a sandstorm! She buries her head to hide from the truth!\n\nPerhaps you can help. I must stay here, but someone needs to speak to Casnar's brother. Unless he can explain things, my daughter has agreed to give up."
"3952276-1-3283";"Darien carries the master key to the city gates. With that key, we can open both the central and eastern gates at the same time. That would allow us to attack the werewolves from two directions."
"3952276-1-3291";"She's staying with the wyresses, at their northern enclave.\n\nMeeting you was a bright spot in this otherwise dark adventure. If you can stop Mother Murk, that'll be one less thing for us to worry about."
"3952276-1-3299";"I have Mages Guild researchers already working on that problem. They're trying to discover how Faolchu originally died. \n\nIf you want to help, they're at Glenumbra Moors. The battle site where Faolchu died. The first time."
"3952276-1-3300";"The Duke had Mages Guild researchers working on that problem. They're trying to find out how Faolchu originally died. \n\nIf you want to help, they're at Glenumbra Moors. The battle site where Faolchu died the first time."
"3952276-1-3304";"Where there are wants, Ildani provides, but the Sentinel guards don't approve. They seized this one's wares!\n\nIldani is free now, but needs her wares back. With all the chaos on the docks, now is the best moment to strike. You will help, yes?"
"3952276-1-3306";"With a few final ingredients, yes. My aides have gathered most of what he needs. Bring him these items, along with some fresh blood from Faolchu's werewolves. Then Alinon should be able to finish his cure."
"3952276-1-3307";"I must see to the consecration of my father's remains. It would be disrespectful to do otherwise.\n\nGo on to Tu'whacca's Throne. Look for an Ash'abah named Ramati. I know these sands well. I will catch up with you soon enough."
"3952276-1-3308";"We need those stones to get into our enclave without being seen. Recover the stones and activate them inside the huts so my sisters can join you.\n\nI still have my stone. Here. Set it by the entrance to the Wyrd Tree and I'll step through to meet you."
"3952276-1-3309";"I made a mistake when I joined them. If I go back out there, they'll kill me! Please, help me appease my ancestors.\n\nThe Bloodthorns stole sacred candles from the tombs. Retrieve them and light them at my family tombs so they know I still honor them."
"3952276-1-3383";"Take one of these newly armed townsfolk with you. Have the civilian light the fires in the towers to signal my father. \n\nI'll take the rest of the civilians and my guards and unlock the gates."
"3952276-1-3394";"I just need to rest for a bit. Then I can get myself there and still have enough power for the ritual.\n\nHere, take the talisman and head on down. I'll meet you there."
"3952276-1-3395";"Absolutely! Captain's ordered us to hold back, but not you … and he did say we need more outside help.\n\nMorale's been down in the dungheap since King Eamond died. If you can lop off this Strastnoc's head, it'd be an inspiration to the men."
"3952276-1-3397";"Gods! There goes that idea! \n\nYou must root out these spies right away then. Do not use weapons though. That will cause a panic, and I don't want that. Find Glarikha and Sir Jarnot and figure out another way."
"3952276-1-3398";"The sooner your fate is accepted, the better we will all feel. \n\nI am queen of these lands, not that weak woman over there. Tell her the truth. After the city's sacked, I'm going to peck out her eyes."
"3952276-1-3400";"Aldcroft. She said werewolves captured Camlorn and the Duke had fled. \n\nWe weren't able to aid her, but perhaps you can. <<1>> in <<2>> would know more."
"3952276-1-3406";"Well, supper is nearly ready. It's not like her ladyship to be late for dinner. Especially when she asked me to open a bottle of her finest wine.\n\nDo you suppose something unpleasant might have befallen her in the tomb?"
"3952276-1-3407";"He corrupted one of the Ansei Wards, using it as some sort of necromantic focus to channel energy from the the dead. He's performing a ritual in the lighthouse. \n\nHe says this ritual will transform him into a lich. Will you help me stop him?"
"3952276-1-3408";"Now hold on. Let's not be too hasty. If you want to help, our healer Heloise is low on supplies.\n\nWe had to abandon our carts along the road when the Montclairs ambushed us. Gather the healing supplies and bring them back here."
"3952276-1-3410";"I did not want to send word to the king until I was certain necromancy was involved. Now though, he should be informed right away.\n\nI must stay here and oversee the cleanup. You are the one who turned the tide here. Will you inform the king as well?"
"3952276-1-3421";"No. You will not cross blades. The Sword Singers were as much mages as warriors. They sought strength of body, and of mind.\n\nThese spirits will speak to you. Choose your words with care though. Tu'whacca says they seek to teach … and to test."
"3952276-1-3428";"That would be perfect! If you can free Len, Suriel, and Councilor Lia, the entire town will gain confidence.\n\nLet them know we're organizing. Maybe help some of the miners, as well. Then meet me behind the inn when you're finished."
"3952276-1-3430";"Yes, and unfortunately, it seems they're now planning a full-scale invasion, establishing a base, building siege weapons …. We need to close the portal, quickly.\n\nI discovered an old tome that explains how, if I can find it again. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-3442";"Bloodthorns desecrate the Lion Guard soldiers killed in the ruins. They raise them as zombies!\n\nIf you use my sacred emblem, you can sanctify the corpses. That will prevent them from being raised as undead."
"3952276-1-3443";"The renowned treasure of Dresan Keep, of course!\n\nYou could finish my quest for me! There are three statues, the Heralds. Take the offerings I brought in my backpack and present them to the proper Heralds. That should open a passage under the well."
"3952276-1-3452";"Indeed! I know she'll be interested in what you discovered. Like all members of the Mages Guild, she's always been more attracted to stuffy old books than to gold or jewels.\n\nAh well, I suppose it's time for me to move on. Farewell."
"3952276-1-3474";"First, I need to listen to the village elder, <<1>>. She offered to heal Sir Etienne, and may have news about his condition.\n\nAnd then, yes, I do need help to deal with this situation. Stay right here."
"3952276-1-3476";"The people are afraid. They need to see that the town leaders are going to take a stand.\n\nWe need the support of the town council. The few that haven't been dragged off to the mines have to show the people how to stand up to these villains."
"3952276-1-3477";"We have to chance it. We don't have any other options.\n\nA squad of Dragons succumbed to the mist before they could retreat. Then that idiot Darien led a few Camlorn soldiers on an ill-conceived rescue mission and they were overcome as well."
"3952276-1-3483";"The resistance has grown, thanks to you. If you want help, use this whistle in front of the mayor's house. Anyone nearby will come to help.\n\nFind me when Gelves is finished. Meanwhile, we'll start removing the Rooks out here. We've got them on edge."
"3952276-1-3485";"One Sound will open the Way, and One Sound will close it.\n\nTake the Call and find a goat. Use the Call to lead the goat across the water, as an offering to the beast. Only then it will be sated. And only then can you return to me."
"3952276-1-3486";"Perhaps, but these run-of-the-mill bandits are bleeding us dry! They're organized and dangerous.\n\nIf you want to help, find Tamien Sellan at the inn. If you don't call attention to yourself, the Red Rooks will probably leave you alone."
"3952276-1-3487";"That's what I wanted to hear!\n\nIf you stand up to those greedy bastards, it will show the rest of the town that we can take back Crosswych."
"3952276-1-3488";"If you insist. But don't say I didn't warn you. \n\nFollow this path to the east and talk to General Gautier. If he can use you, he will."
"3952276-1-3499";"Because it is my fate to come here and tell you this, just as it was another's fate to tell me mine, and yet another's before that.\n\nYour fate is to race the storm and to win. The question is … are these fates fixed? Will you help me test this?"
"3952276-1-3503";"Some of the dead were protected by wards designed to prevent desecration. Look for a tomb with these wards and use the stone there.\n\nThat should be safe enough for my purposes."
"3952276-1-3514";"The bones show you being consumed, eaten by a terrible duneripper named Istraga. She lairs to the south. If the bones roll true, the only thing left will be your left foot.\n\nThis must not be! Good … you must slay Istraga. Spurn fate's grip."
"3952276-1-3519";"The Lion Guard sets up camp wherever there's a need. And this one is vital. We're barely keeping Angof's dead from pouring out of Cath Bedraud.\n\nThe rotting bastards are damn tough, that's for sure."
"3952276-1-3533";"Three locks protect Angof's inner sanctum. I doubt that even you can get in there by simply knocking.\n\nYou need three shard-keys to open the locks. They're well-guarded, so you're going to have to kill a few things to get them."
"3952276-1-3535";"She wanted to buy this track, but I outbid her. <<1>>'s over there with her lizards, waiting for the track to fail so she can buy it cheap.\n\nIf you can bring me a fast lizard, though, the track can stay in business. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-3537";"No, and that is what I fear the most. I would never be able to forgive myself ….\n\nAt the very least, though, I must retrieve his supply pack. Everything is in there—our maps, our water, our food. I cannot survive without these things."
"3952276-1-3539";"He's the constable's brother. He saw her dragged off to the mines when she tried to stand up to the Red Rooks."
"3952276-1-3571";"They went south, toward the old ruins. They killed most of us, but the captain didn't go down until they cast some kind of sleep spell on him. \n\nPlease, help him. I can't."
"3952276-1-3573";"The place is haunted. Makes my skin crawl just getting near the damn place. There are imps everywhere. And the whispers. They threaten me. Warn me to stay away.\n\nBut this is my land now. No bodiless voice is going to make me leave."
"3952276-1-3575";"Excellent. The messages go to the Dominion camp's commander. Find the commander and you'll find the messages.\n\nBring any messages you find to Captain Gilame. She's up on the cliffs."
"3952276-1-3598";"He's the prince of my stronghold. I left it recently, married a Redguard. Osgrikh swore an oath to Malacath over it and sent those Oathbound after us.\n\nIf he thinks I've abandoned my husband, he's a fool."
"3952276-1-3601";"Legend says it only appears to a chosen few. I've had to ask strangers to walk through the ruins to look for it. Untrained eyes! I'm that desperate.\n\n<<1>> might tell you where to look, if you're willing."
"3952276-1-3603";"Really? That would ease my mind. Curse these wounds or I'd go along with you!\n\nThe last time I saw my scouts, they were retreating toward the tower. They're raw recruits and I'm worried about them. Send anyone you find to the base of the tower."
"3952276-1-3648";"Then Stendarr has not forgotten us. I have given my wife an antidote, but I cannot leave her side. \n\nIf you will look for Taren, though … bless you. I taught him to head for the high ground when in danger, so look for him on the cliffs."
"3952276-1-3669";"Yes. Go into the cavern and burn the disciples' food supplies—that should suffice.\n\nThen come and find me on the upper levels. That's where I think we'll find the entrance to her lair."
"3952276-1-3670";"Indeed. You will find the Daedric cultists are uncovering the vessels on the east side of the ruins even now.\n\nGet them for me. Get as many as you can, and we will have what we need to create the Water Stone."
"3952276-1-3671";"A spirit? A Daedra? This is part of what must be exposed.\n\nWhatever it is, it has enslaved local villagers—calling them Rain Disciples. It taps their minds for its power. To what end I do not know, but I believe you can unmask its intentions."
"3952276-1-3672";"I don't know … perhaps? \n\nAll these other things can be replaced, but they took the temple's relics—sacred ornaments that date back to the time of the Ra Gada. If you could reclaim these relics, that would be a start."
"3952276-1-3674";"They once called me the Sly Scarab, but my given name is Mazrahil. \n\nOther questions must wait—those orders are of paramount importance. If you get them, I can hobble unnoticed to the ruins below the gate and await you there. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-3686";"My sisters would not want me to trust an outsider, but they are not here, and I cannot leave her side.\n\nFrankly, I am surprised you share my concerns. You are sure you wish to help me?"
"3952276-1-3699";"With Countess Tamrith here, I must secure the camp before we resume the hunt. To this end, I need someone to find Jonah Marose and his mother.\n\nJonah claimed he could sense <<1>>. After upsetting everyone, Jonah and his mother fled the camp."
"3952276-1-3703";"Might as well give it a shot. He's been telling us a sad story about his kidnapped family, but I don't believe a word of it.\n\nIf you want to try to make the bandit talk, he's right over there."
"3952276-1-3706";"They went south, toward the old ruins. They killed most of us, but the captain didn't go down until they cast some kind of sleep spell on him. \n\nPlease, help him. I can't."
"3952276-1-3728";"You would venture up to Jackdaw Cove? Uela's influence has corrupted everything there. It's wretched, but if you are willing, I will not try to dissuade you.\n\nSearch for my sisters near Jackdaw Cove. Perhaps with your help, Uela can be destroyed."
"3952276-1-3825";"We sent refugees from the town south, to meet Captain Janeve at Camp Tamrith, but the mayor of Crestshade refused to leave. Said she had to save her people.\n\nShe begged us to warn Shornhelm. If she's still alive, she could use some help."
"3952276-1-3848";"Outside the gate and across the bridge. You can see the smoke and flames from a distance.\n\nBut why would you want to go there? My brother Bernard sent me to call out the King's soldiers. Why risk yourself for strangers?"
"3952276-1-3852";"Of course, but it'll take time—time Evermore doesn't have. You could go now. \n\nThey need someone like you to rally the city's defenses. After what you've accomplished here, I have no doubt you can make a difference. Will you go, wayfarer?"
"3952276-1-3873";"Do not disparage, youth. These are Vivec's children. They died for Morrowind and for him. \n\nWe must provide for their rest. Anoint any remains you find with this sacred oil. That will soothe their spirits."
"3952276-1-3876";"Shor's bones, you're a brave one! If you can make it out alive, put steel or spell to the commanders in the encampment. They're the ones most likely to have a copy of their orders.\n\nThen head for the gates of the fort."
"3952276-1-3877";"<<1>> believes Conele can use it to control a Brother of Strife. Sings-With-Reed would know more. As for Galyn, the Covenant caught her.\n\nHere's what I need from you: look for survivors in the mud mounds. Rescue Galyn. Oh, and don't get killed."
"3952276-1-3878";"Then you'll stand where you're needed. Right now, Grandmaster Tanval Indoril's at a manor in the north of the city. \n\nHe's got a smart plan, but he needs help."
"3952276-1-3880";"Ask Holgunn. He's commanding the defense of the west gate.\n\nIf you need a guide, speak to Garyn."
"3952276-1-3881";"Get to the tombs. Tanval's in there, performing his ritual. He has no idea what happened.\n\nGuard him until he's done!"
"3952276-1-3882";"You'll find Garyn west of the city, on the slopes of Ash Mountain. I sent a detachment of soldiers with him to ensure his safety. I'm certain he already knows what needs to be done."
"3952276-1-3883";"I've known Furon and Reesa for a while now. I respect them both. I just need to know which of them has the better idea. Start with Furon, then talk to Reesa. Hear them out and do what they ask of you.\n\nWhen you've decided what's best, let me know."
"3952276-1-3884";"The flasks are upstairs. Use them near the walls of the fort. I expect the killers will be lurking there.\n\nStrikes-from-Shadows is leading a group of our more experienced troops. Meet up with him at the tower to the east when you're done."
"3952276-1-3885";"A lot of townfolk were burned by lava. <<1>> can make a burn salve, but it requires shalk chitin.\n\nYou'll need to kill shalks and take their chitin to him at the temple. He'll know what to do with it."
"3952276-1-3886";"To fight fire, we must use fire. I need chitin from the shalks that came from the lava. \n\nThey roam the village now. Bring the chitin to me. I will prepare it."
"3952276-1-3887";"These people need help. <<1>> can make a burn salve out of shalk chitin."
"3952276-1-3888";"Because he's the most stubborn creature you'll ever meet. He needs to see these Argonians are on his side.\n\nIf you want to help, <<1>> needs shalk chitin for his salve. Kill them and take the chitin to the Argonian. He's somewhere in town."
"3952276-1-3889";"I can't officially authorize it—but it sure would be useful to know why the Orcs are here. \n\nI saw an Orc studying a letter. Might be orders from somewhere. If you could get hold of a copy …."
"3952276-1-3891";"The Chimer would not willingly release us to Aetherius. To set their souls free on the river you will have to destroy the keepers. \n\nIf you would do this, you will find me on the road away from here. I sense something I must see for myself."
"3952276-1-3892";"He thought I didn't know. Unsavory types, disbarred from the Mages Guild. I was going to find out the truth!\n\nYou should investigate. They meet in a cave near the southern camp."
"3952276-1-3895";"I will explain in time. For now, go to the kwama chamber east of here and find the mushroom called <<z:1>>. \n\nI must speak with my students. I will meet you there."
"3952276-1-3899";"I need a certain relic, but it's protected by my ancestors. It's a sin for me to fight them. \n\nYou are not Indoril, so you can enter the tombs and bring it back. The door is across the square."
"3952276-1-3901";"Me? Look at me. I'm hurt. \n\nJust beat them a little then blow this whistle. They're trained to return to the mine."
"3952276-1-3903";"Well … no. Sorry.\n\nLook, she's in trouble, but I'm no hero. I'm going back to Narsis where it's safe. Could you …?"
"3952276-1-3904";"Then here's the finish. Kill their leader, Gruznak the Impatient. \n\nIf there's one thing an Orc can't resist, it's a challenge. Blow the great horn by the gate—that'll bring him out. Meanwhile, I'll go find reinforcements."
"3952276-1-3905";"Khralek used some foul necromancy to bind our souls to our skulls. Mine sits upon his dark altar. The skulls of my followers were spread among the Orcs, their souls to be used as slaves.\n\nHe tortures us and torments us endlessly."
"3952276-1-3906";"I've concocted a ritual to summon spirits present on that day. Talk to whoever appears. This should imbue you with the essence of that moment. \n\nYou'll also need to find the heartstones. Then we can open the gateway to the past."
"3952276-1-3909";"I found nothing. The captain went east on his own search mission. He's been gone for some time now.\n\nI need to stay here in case he returns. Would you be willing to seek him out along the eastern road and ensure his safety?"
"3952276-1-3910";"They think their families were stolen in the middle of the night. I've heard everything from a plot by the House leaders to Elf-eating banekin roaming the countryside.\n\nThe kinhouse is looking into it."
"3952276-1-3911";"That's the problem. We wanted to avenge Father's death so we split up to find a way, but I'm not that brave. There's too many of them. I'd just be throwing my life away. \n\nYou look tougher than me. Maybe you'd take this torch and burn their supplies?"
"3952276-1-3912";"My wife'll kill me if I lost her axe. My head! \n\nHey, you could find that screeching witch and get the axe back. I think we had a small camp nearby. I'll catch up to you after my head stops hurting."
"3952276-1-3915";"Oh, you can't make a highborn serve! You need flattery. If we're properly respectful, he may appear.\n\nMy scrolls say there's a shrine on the east rise and one on the west. Honor him at both. Then meet me at the center of Othrenis."
"3952276-1-3917";"He died. It was so sudden. I wasn't even allowed to attend his funeral, but I know we will reunite in death.\n\nI can't find his tomb. I just want to talk to him one more time. Will you help me find him?"
"3952276-1-3919";"Ritual implements—a skull and a candle. Unless tomb robbers got them, look in the vaults to the east and west. \n\nThere's a puzzle lock on each one, and no, I don't remember the solution. Good luck with that."
"3952276-1-3922";"My mate and our spiritual leader. She was in the village when the pirates attacked.\n\nI'm just an old saltrice farmer, outsider. I beg you! Find her and bring her back."
"3952276-1-3923";"Go find Vara-Zeen. He's our elder. He told me to run and find help.\n\nI've run so fast I can't run anymore. Talk to Vara-Zeen. He'll know what to do."
"3952276-1-3924";"Saalu Othrys is our overseer. Her husband, Garvas, was organizing a defense of the stables. I didn't see where the matriarch and her daughter went, but her boys headed for the pools.\n\nPoor folks. They were a good sort … for fieldmasters, that is."
"3952276-1-3925";"I don't know. I have to stay here to defend what's left of the stead. I can't just leave.\n\nThe last I saw my boys, Dedras and Mevis, they were running south to the sulfur pools. I have no idea where my wife and daughter have gone. I wish I knew."
"3952276-1-3926";"Just so. The Nedes' warchief is named Ornskar. Kill her and cut out her heart. When you have these sacrifices in hand, head to the ritual altar in the center of the temple.\n\nWe'll be waiting."
"3952276-1-3930";"Just a little advice. Start at that large tent. That's where I'd hide my key if I were a Khajiit.\n\nIf you are not killed and left to the crabs, I will meet you at the meditation mound when you are finished."
"3952276-1-3933";"My middle son, <<1>>, is leading the search for Bjorick west of the hall.\n\nGo speak to him. Help him find his missing brother and end this nightmare."
"3952276-1-3934";"You'll find spider cocoons along the beach east of the manor house. Look there.\n\nShow no mercy to these craven Goblins and their spider pets."
"3952276-1-3939";"Did I mention they're dumb? Put a harness back on them, say a few calm words, and they'll run back here.\n\nThe hard part would be finding harnesses. I've only got one here. The rest are scattered with the guar. You'll have to find them in the pools."
"3952276-1-3940";"Put a harness on them. Say a few calm words. They're like children or Breton slaves.\n\nI've only got one harness left. The rest got scattered in the attack, but I bet you can find them. When you're done, speak to <<1>>."
"3952276-1-3941";"You're the only one I trust. Go to the front lines. I know this sounds gruesome, but I need you to inspect the bodies of Covenant troops after they fall.\n\nBring me anything … well, unusual. And keep this between us. I don't want any panic."
"3952276-1-3942";"After the gates are unbarred, look for Serien in the fortress keep. We think he's holed up inside, studying his spellbooks.\n\nBlood for the Pact!"
"3952276-1-3943";"You'll face the dead. I don't know how he's doing it, but Serien has transformed our warriors into undead slaves. \n\nOnce the ward is down, enter the gate. Make your way to the keep and confront <<1>>. We'll join you as soon as we can."
"3952276-1-3944";"There's only one place he could have gone: Kragenmoor. The city is the gateway to Tormented Spire. To get past the wards at the base of the mountain, he'd need to talk to the Dres' grandmaster that holds the key. Go! And stop him."
"3952276-1-3946";"No. Vaermina and her minion still have the general in their grips.\n\nYou've done this before, so I think you should do it again. We need to get Godrun back."
"3952276-1-3947";"Garyn Indoril is leading the charge. You can find him at the command tent west of here. Word is we've got General Serien backed into a corner.\n\nMay Kyne speed you. Split some Covenant skulls for me!"
"3952276-1-3949";"No, he just needs you to talk. House Dres isn't popular. The Nords and Argonians in Ebonheart won't speak to him. And the other Dark Elf Houses don't like the Dres much either.\n\nConvince the townspeople to work together. Then speak to Othral."
"3952276-1-3950";"Because we who rule Ebonheart are of House Dres. We are not well loved, even by other Dunmer.\n\nI need you to visit the Argonians, Nords, and Dunmer of <<1>>. Convince them to work together before the Covenant attacks."
"3952276-1-3953";"We've made a potion to help the afflicted, but we've run out, and we need components to make more. \n\nGather <<zm:1>> by slaying cursed spirits, and collect <<zm:2>> from the dead. Then take them south to Merarii."
"3952276-1-3954";"It's an ancient vault built to hold dangerous magical items. This one contains a hidden room, where the most dangerous objects were kept. No doubt that's where the Daggers released the curse. \n\nKeeper Vildras can lead you there. Good luck."
"3952276-1-3956";"The best we can do is fertilize it. We're using mudcrab meat wrapped in ashreed. Both are common around the quarter.\n\nWe've also set guards around the tree to keep the Dunmer away."
"3952276-1-3957";"Ulov Stormwall, my commander. Something happened while I was away patrolling the road. When I came back to report, he was covered in blood. He was butchering Khelendii.\n\nHe saw me and came at me. He's up the road. I need to get out of here."
"3952276-1-3961";"I had to kill them. They were changing.\n\nDo you think I'm mad? See for yourself. I was in the cellar of that stable when it copied one of my troops. I locked it down there. Here's the key. Go ahead and introduce yourself."
"3952276-1-3962";"Burn their boats, kill the bastards, but most of all, get their wretched captain! I want Captain Sa'dir dead! He sleeps in his ship's rigging while we suffer. Ring the ship's warning bell to wake the cur.\n\nHere. Use this torch to burn their boats."
"3952276-1-3965";"See the rats running around the village? Harmless. But people are afraid of them.\n\nTake this bag. Grab as many rats as you can. Bring them back here and release them at the door. That should scatter Madras's group for a while."
"3952276-1-3969";"You're going to have to kill a lot of kwama to get through the tunnels, right?\n\nLetting them rot won't help anyone. Why not harvest their cuttle? It's the waxy stuff on their beaks. Million and one uses. I'll give you a fair price for it."
"3952276-1-3971";"Find Giron Sadri. He's upstairs. He needs to know what you discovered.\n\nDo whatever he asks. I need to speak to the guards and prepare to seal Narsis."
"3952276-1-3972";"I'll gather the House Hlaalu guards and follow you. Whatever you find, the guard will be there to back you up.\n\nNow go. Find your ally and save the councilor. I'll catch up with you soon."
"3952276-1-3974";"Bring them on. We don't skeever out of a fight. When we're attacked, we fight.\n\nI wager you think we should fight for the rest of the Pact. All right! Prove they've got some backbone. Let's see you beat three of my men. And do it the Nord way."
"3952276-1-3975";"I don't want any more of my carriers hurt, but I must recover the manifest and at least part of the cargo. The house noble who owns this cargo will flay me alive if I come back empty-handed. \n\nThe raiders took everything up the hill."
"3952276-1-3978";"That's what makes this spy so dangerous! And never question my orders again. Never! Go expose Ragna Stormcrag for the spy she is. I command it!\n\nNow get out of here. I have things to do."
"3952276-1-3979";"Let's just say he's been somewhat unpredictable. And he see spies around every corner. You don't want to get him angry, trust me."
"3952276-1-3980";"The Tribunal punishes the people for my faithless ways. The shrines to Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec are surrounded by a foul smell and angry alit.\n\nPlease. Do what I cannot. Burn these flowers at the shrines. Then pray for Ebonheart."
"3952276-1-3984";"It's a vital link between Stonefalls and the Rift. With Fort Virak held by the enemy, we're cut off from supplies.\n\nHead up there and report to <<1>>. I'll be right behind you."
"3952276-1-3985";"Each has a thing I require, and you must get all three and then decide which should be mine. What you know of me may help you decide which to give me, but what my friends know may be more important."
"3952276-1-3986";"We sent in some scouts to assess the situation, but they haven't returned. I don't want to march in there blindly, but we can't wait much longer!"
"3952276-1-3987";"Or maybe you could join me here. No?\n\nIf you insist, you'll have to get her attention. A few well-placed punches should get you an audience. You might try going to the beached ship and knocking heads with one of the drunken rowdies there."
"3952276-1-3989";"Those who complete the trials may commune with the Hist. I don't know why this interests the Dominion, but I fear it is no good for Shadowfen.\n\nPerhaps you could find out yourself? Take the trials, and keep an eye on this enemy of our people?"
"3952276-1-3990";"It is different for every pilgrim who drinks the Hist sap. You may speak words or think thoughts that aren't your own.\n\nWhen the Hist shows all it wants you to see, find <<1>> at the highest tier of our pyramid. He'll help you interpret your visions."
"3952276-1-3991";"Such ardor! You might consider undergoing the Trials of the Burnished Scales, if you haven't already.\n\nI would welcome any help. I stored the relics in this cart. Perhaps one of the pilgrims observed something I did not."
"3952276-1-3995";"I was hoping you'd say that. If I disappear, someone might notice and raise an alarm.\n\nThe entrance to the ruins is down by the river, beyond the mess tent. If you find anything of significance, take it directly to Captain Valec."
"3952276-1-3996";"Hmm. Well, the Sentinels certainly wouldn't expect you to challenge them. But they're a mean bunch. And deadly.\n\nLook, if you're determined to get involved, have a chat with Commander Taldyn in the training yard. He's their superior."
"3952276-1-3997";"We tricked <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>> into our cellars and bolted the doors behind them. Still they refuse to lay down their weapons.\n\nPerhaps they'll listen to an outsider. If you convince them to surrender, <<4>> would be in your debt."
"3952276-1-3998";"Should you be?\n\nSpeak to <<1>> in the Guild Halls. And stay alert. You wouldn't want to be the next victim."
"3952276-1-4000";"Look for the mud huts. Don't ask for him by name, or he'll think you a debt collector.\n\nRemain discreet. If <<1>> found the scent of <<2>>, follow it until its end."
"3952276-1-4001";"Encourage them to leave, blue reed. How you do it is your concern. Then I fill your purse, yes?\n\nPerhaps you should pretend to consider a purchase. Or perhaps you should consider a purchase, hmm? Such prices, unheard of in all of Stormhold."
"3952276-1-4003";"You freed me from the Dominion's clutches before those skin-stealing milk drinkers could kill me and wear my face. Of course I could use your help.\n\nMeet my regiment at <<1>>. Keep your blades sharp. I'll find a way to turn you loose on the Dominion."
"3952276-1-4005";"Dreugh showed up in the middle of the battle and started slaughtering everyone.\n\nIf you want to pitch in, report to Captain Noris. He's the officer in charge here. He's encamped to the north."
"3952276-1-4009";"Nonsense. The Vanguard is my priority right now. I'm sure one of your abilities can find ample employment elsewhere. \n\nIf you have further questions—and I'm sure you do—speak to my seneschal, <<1>>."
"3952276-1-4012";"There should be two wardstones at the entrance, each attuned to a constellation. The Atronach and the Tower, if I recall. The key should allow you to disrupt those stones, and any others you encounter on your journey.\n\nThree guide your steps!"
"3952276-1-4013";"Fah! They're no good to me injured. But the Dominion lackeys are another matter.\n\nPut the fear of One-Eye and her crew into them. That should loosen some tongues. Then find out where our Khajiit is hiding."
"3952276-1-4014";"If he won't listen, she must. We Ashlanders just don't ignore the advice of our wise women. Our Ashkhan defying her wishes … it's wrong.\n\nPlease. If you can help, seek her north of the temple."
"3952276-1-4015";"Me? Ha! This mind is for planning, not swordfighting and bloodletting. \n\nOh, and counting coins. I am very good at that. This plan is reasonable, no?"
"3952276-1-4018";"One of those Maulborn must have the key. \n\nAnd one more thing—one of them was carrying around a creepy Daedric book when they brought me in. They took it into the lower tunnels. If you get the book, I could use it to explain my absence."
"3952276-1-4019";"My people and even some enemies languish in the Daedra's Oblivion realm.\n\nThe raiders seized an Argonian gel called firesap. Find some. It should overheat the crystals and cause them to crack. Then you can return my people."
"3952276-1-4021";"I gathered as many survivors as I could, but not everyone got out. Those monsters, the Vereansu, are tossing captives into the burning buildings.\n\nOur leader, <<1>>, rushed back in to search for survivors and try to protect the <<2>>. He needs help."
"3952276-1-4022";"I heard them crying out in the darkness. The plague's taken them. They've … turned.\n\nThe wards. Concentrate on the wards. There're three of them. Smash them all."
"3952276-1-4026";"I don't know, but when he came out from talking to our grandmaster, he was in charge. Our House Elves and slaves alike are terrified. \n\nIf you want to help, please speak with our grandmaster. Maybe he'll listen to a new voice."
"3952276-1-4030";"Experiencing our curse uniquely suits you to deciding our fate.\n\nYou should hear the counsel of <<1>> and <<2>> before making your decision."
"3952276-1-4032";"Untie me so I can make a break for it! And free my guards. Their names were Nerys, Liam, Wilhem, and Gerren.\n\nI overheard a necromancer say geodes with souls are fragile, and would release them if broken. Please, set them free!"
"3952276-1-4035";"The House Dunmer monks must understand we're not enemies. Take them a gift of herbs and potions from the supply in our camp. \n\nThe Ashkhan has warriors protecting it. Fight through them. Take the medicine. Deliver it to the temple. Can you do this?"
"3952276-1-4036";"Let's see—a half dozen wasp gizzards. But then you would have to get to my hut on the shore to make the concoction. I left my alchemy journal there.\n\nWhen it's made, toss the mixture onto the tree outside my hut. That will rile the wasps up!"
"3952276-1-4039";"It means ""open"" in my language. I used to speak so many languages, but I've forgotten most of them.\n\nThere's much I can't remember. Go, I'll be fine. I just need some time to rest."
"3952276-1-4042";"Exactly. So if you smash any spheres or spiders, take their resonators. You can bring them to me for study.\n\nWhile you're at it, destroy any repair stations you see. Then they can't make more resonators. All right?"
"3952276-1-4043";"The medallions focus the power of the Tear of Saint Veloth. Wear one and the effects of the plague are slowed. \n\nWhen the Ashlanders attacked, the medallions were scattered. We have so few of them. They won't do anyone any good on these husks."
"3952276-1-4045";"I don't know. The smell may have driven the beasts into a frenzy. \n\nPerhaps, if you'd be willing … would you burn these flowers at each shrine? If the Three respond, tell Disciple Sildras. Perhaps that will restore his faith."
"3952276-1-4046";"Nothing! There was never a reply.\n\nI'm leaving these swamps. I'm going to go to the drylands. This is my last letter to <<1>>. Will you deliver it to him? If not into his hands, then his grave. I fear the worst."
"3952276-1-4050";"The wind has not whispered that to me. There have always been <<mz:1>>, but never this dangerous.\n\nMy mind would be eased to see travelers free of this threat. Life here is hard enough already."
"3952276-1-4051";"I hid in an offal pile. I thought I was doomed, but a Shadowscale named <<1>> found me and helped me escape. I don't know what happened to him after that. \n\nIf you want to help, go see him. He might still be there."
"3952276-1-4057";"He didn't disturb the bodies. It's something else.\n\nI want to understand him, but he won't discuss it with me. He's set up camp not far from here. Perhaps there are some clues there."
"3952276-1-4059";"They stood watch over Ash Mountain for centuries. All we need to do is grab their attention again. Kill Daedra, take their hearts, then burn them at the ruin altars. That should draw them out.\n\nWalks-in-Ash is waiting for you at the top. Good luck!"
"3952276-1-4060";"Balreth is an engine of fire and death. You'll need something to slow him down. Use the totem, slow him down, and your task should be much easier. \n\nBut first, as you said, you'll need to summon the guardians. Sun on your scales, my friend."
"3952276-1-4061";"We've got pickaxes, but it's nigh impossible to collapse a mountain and fight at the same time. \n\nWe'll keep these Scamps busy while you collapse the entrances. Don't worry. There should be plenty of fighting."
"3952276-1-4062";"The Dark Elves see the coral as a gift from their living god, Vivec. He saved them, they say, in the Akaviri war. Now, that does not matter. The Pact military could use your skill and prowess in their fight.\n\nGo well along the river, my friend."
"3952276-1-4069";"Turns out it was a Daedric artifact. Who knew? They shattered the crystal to use the pieces for a ritual to summon Daedra into our world.\n\nI need someone who can get these fragments from these cultists, before they can carry out their plans."
"3952276-1-4070";"The dreamers made off with a crystal of incredible power and shattered it into fuel for their foul purposes. My wizard tells me that there are five pieces scattered about the camp. I beseech you, go out and collect these pieces for me. I will pay."
"3952276-1-4071";"They're using the shards to summon daedra for their Prince, Vermina.  Stop those rituals and bring back the shards to me."
"3952276-1-4073";"A moment, please. Our Lady knows of your arrival. Sit by the fire and she'll speak to you presently."
"3952276-1-4079";"Let's just say he's been somewhat unpredictable. Sees spies around every corner. You don't want to get him angry, trust me."
"3952276-1-4082";"Sorry. I'm a little upset. Could you untie me, please? I can get back home on my own."
"3952276-1-4083";"I came to reclaim a crystal that my father lost to the Supernal dreams. I wanted to make him proud and well… you can see how that turned out. Can you get me out of here?"
"3952276-1-4088";"Yay!"
"3952276-1-4090";"They plan to use me as a sacrifice in their ritual. Will you set me free so I can rejoin my father?"
"3952276-1-4092";"Southwest of here. Could you try to find her again?\n\nShe worries me, but I must see to the town's defense."
"3952276-1-4097";"I don't have anyone as skilled as you to take on the Dreadlord. They are powerful mages."
"3952276-1-4113";"Yes … at least the last few. They're Lion Guard, like me. Renard, Elise, Laroche. I saw them alive as I fled.\n\nI know Gaston. He thinks my people expendable. Please, you have to bring them back. Until they're safe, nobody gets the fragment I took."
"3952276-1-4114";"Need to repair this welkynd stone next to me—it's the focus of a powerful binding spell.\n\nI think it contained the freed Daedra, and unfortunately, it seems our Goblin friends have broken it. They've made four of the pieces into totems."
"3952276-1-4116";"My guards and my partner, <<1>>, were taken. Horrible men and skeletons attacked us … I think they're members of the Worm Cult!\n\nI got away, but I heard screams coming from their camp, just down the hill. Can you help me?"
"3952276-1-4123";"Help us get revenge for generations of slavery!\n\nFind Betina Volek. Lure her to her family's townhouse. Bring her there and we will have our revenge."
"3952276-1-4126";"I heard a whisper of a sacred Dark Elf performance. Those who performed it splashed in the River of Humor. And the Dark Elves … laughed.\n\nIf you tread the dust of the tomb, will you seek the rite for me?"
"3952276-1-4127";"Grandmaster Indoril appointed his senior aide to command the Vanguard. I believe the man's name is <<1>>.\n\nKill him. That is the price of affronting the Dres."
"3952276-1-4129";"They're searching for a magical relic called a keystone. If they find it, they could cause much havoc in Shadowfen.\n\nMaybe that Kothringi could help us find it before the Dominion does. Could you infiltrate Zuuk and rescue him?"
"3952276-1-4130";"As the mud is my mother, I have no idea. I've been scavenging in Xal Ithix for years. It's not entirely safe, but nothing like this has ever happened.\n\nYou should talk to <<1>>. He's at his hut, at the end of the village. I'm sure he has some idea."
"3952276-1-4131";"There is still a source of power left to us: the Tribunal. Perhaps the Three will show us a way through these trying times.\n\nGo to the sanctuary on this floor and pray at the shrine. Perhaps the Tribunal will answer you."
"3952276-1-4132";"Things that are too important to fall into the hands of the Maulborn. They're in three locked chests, so you'll need to get the keys first."
"3952276-1-4133";"Don't need to tell us twice. We'll stay on high ground until the plague dissipates.\n\nIf you find Diiril and he's turned … do what you have to. Understand?"
"3952276-1-4140";"I'm a scavenger, not a warrior. Look around us. The stranglers attack everything that moves, whether it can resist or not.\n\nCan you help the few fighters we have left?"
"3952276-1-4142";"They got in behind the temple building to the southwest. <<1>> has taken command of its defenses. Even with the spirits and healed soldiers, I fear we'll be overrun.\n\nThis is a fight for our lives!"
"3952276-1-4147";"Pash-Riha, my sister. She is crazy. \n\nNot long ago, we repelled a Covenant attack. She chased their leader to the northwest. Would you look for her? If you find her slain, could you drag her corpse back to town?"
"3952276-1-4148";"How good of you to ask. We are fine. Only a few minor injuries.\n\nThere may be some Covenant soldiers left, if you want to kill them. You should speak to Elder Seven-Bellies in town."
"3952276-1-4149";"That I do. I would really like to see their supplies burn. Are you someone who could get in and out without getting killed? I can even give you a torch. \n\nIf you do it, meet me and my brothers on the road north of Muth Gnaar."
"3952276-1-4150";"I know, but I can't go back to my brothers if the supplies aren't burned. I have a torch—but I'm not a fighter! \n\nYou seem bold. If you got in and set fire to their supplies—could you do that? You could meet me north of Muth Gnaar later."
"3952276-1-4152";"They're heathen Ashlanders outside the light and protection of the Tribunal!\n\nI can't bear to think about it any more. If you really want to help, find <<1>>. He's gathered a few of the survivors outside Muth Gnaar, away from the Vereansu patrols."
"3952276-1-4153";"I'm certain of it. If you can find and rescue them, meet us at our rendezvous on the hillside overlooking <<1>>.\n\nWe need to know what our Shadowscales learned. The Dominion must expect a powerful prize to send a force this large."
"3952276-1-4154";"Badly! The registrar makes us wait by this giant smelly toadstool while our gifts of culture, art, and religion gather dust.\n\nHow about you take these gifts for us? Trade them for Dark Elf stuff. We need books, clothes, and relics."
"3952276-1-4155";"Veloth's blessing! So impressive! But a paltry blessing doesn't make you invincible.\n\nYou did take down the wards, though. I'll give you that. Perhaps you do pose a challenge to Vox after all."
"3952276-1-4162";"Not dead, at least not yet. The lamia bit them and carried the four of them off. I'm in over my head.\n\nListen, I have an antivenom kit. Could you go in and see if you can help them? The kit's easy to use. You just need snake venom."
"3952276-1-4163";"We've been ordered not to discuss the entirety of the situation in public. To prevent panic, you understand.\n\nThe Lady summons you. Go."
"3952276-1-4166";"I think so, but probably not far. I need to go to the inn. That's where survivors were gathering."
"3952276-1-4169";"Speak to the overseer, <<1>>. She knows more of the Goblins and those accursed mines.\n\nDo not trust her completely. She was master here in the terrible time before the Pact."
"3952276-1-4171";"Shor's bones! What would we do without you? Bring down the ward, and I'll lead the boys in. \n\nGo on ahead and find Walks-in-Ash."
"3952276-1-4173";"He's the sadist who slaughtered innocents and hatchlings. They call him <<1>>. I've seen his filthy banner over their camp.\n\nBurn his banner. Defile his camp. He's too proud to ignore an insult. Cut out his heart, if he has one, and bring it to me."
"3952276-1-4174";"I don't know, but <<1>> might. He's been in Xal Ithix as long as I can remember. If anyone knows what's wrong with the swamp, he will.\n\nLook for the tree-minder in his hut. He's usually there, consulting with the elders or communing with the Hist."
"3952276-1-4175";"I don't know, but <<1>> might. He's been in Xal Ithix as long as I can remember. If anyone knows what's wrong with the swamp, he will.\n\nLook for the tree-minder in his hut. He's usually there, consulting with the elders or communing with the Hist."
"3952276-1-4177";"What are you worried about? You have Veloth's Blessing. It's your connection to this world. Believe in yourself and in Veloth. The saint will protect you. \n\nAnd I can't wait to see how all this turns out. Don't disappoint me."
"3952276-1-4180";"Speak with them, my friend. Perhaps you can earn their trust. One awaits you on the platform in the center of the caldera.\n\nVivec walk with you."
"3952276-1-4187";"I have a feeling she's going to want your help. Tales of your exploits already spread through Narsis. Find the Argonian, and I'd wager that before you say a word, she asks you to meet with her companions."
"3952276-1-4189";"""Day Eight: No sign of additional inscriptions. I'll need to look elsewhere for clues as to how to open the vault in Razak's Wheel.\n\nThis construct must hold some clue. I should take it apart. There's a loud buzzing behind one of its compartments."""
"3952276-1-4192";"A number of Argonian relics are scattered throughout this swamp. I've been told that they're powerful enough to turn the tide of the war in our favor.\n\nI was skeptical, but the Dominion presence here seems to confirm it. We need to get to them first."
"3952276-1-4194";"You're welcome to try. We need that keystone.\n\nLook for <<1>>, an old Imperial general they left here to rot. He's the prisoners' leader."
"3952276-1-4195";"<<1>> might be able to help you. He's in the dungeon, foraging for supplies.\n\nHere, let me put this ointment on you. It'll mask your scent from the ferals. But not for long."
"3952276-1-4196";"They're dead, too … somewhere in here. The Imperials took them away from me.\n\nPlease bury us beneath the tree just outside the cave entrance to the prison. Inter us in the open air, away from this dank place."
"3952276-1-4198";"No, it is not our way. If her spirit is to return to the Hist, some part of her must be buried properly.\n\nThen she would be reunited with us, even after all this time."
"3952276-1-4206";"<You see a broken key-ring hanging from the tree-minder's belt.>\n\n<One of the slashes that killed her must have shattered the ring and cast the key to the ground somewhere.>"
"3952276-1-4207";"I've created a refined Spell Gem that should allow you to slip into the camp. Just be wary. The spiders guarding the Goblins will not be fooled. \n\nAssault <<1>> and return Dithis to us safely, if you would be so kind."
"3952276-1-4208";"Our best bet is to go back to the source: the Mages that first bound Balreth. Some of them are buried at the necropolis to the south, a place called Othrenis. I've sent a scout, Onuja, to learn what we need. Go there, and aid him."
"3952276-1-4209";"As we speak, two of my guardians investigate rumored anchor sites. Merric and Aelif are the best the guild has to offer. Meet up with them outside of Daggerfall. You can proceed from there."
"3952276-1-4211";"We're not sure, but it seems to have something to do with that Mortuum Vivicus her notes mentioned. <<1>> is far from here, but I've prepared a portal that will carry us across Tamriel. \n\nWhat do you say, comrade? Venture with me into the unknown?"
"3952276-1-4214";"Please. ""Procure."" There's a bottle of <<1>>  hoarded by  a Nord tavernkeeper here. I offered to buy, but he won't sell.\n\nFrankly, he'll never drink it, so he'd never know if it was replaced by a copy."
"3952276-1-4216";"You can click them in any order; the IOs are set as quest interactables."
"3952276-1-4218";"Steal? Such an ugly word. ""Procure."" I'd like you to procure a single, precious bottle of <<1>>. A former war wizard has it now.\n\nJust replace her bottle with this identical bottle filled with cheap rotgut. We'll both profit."
"3952276-1-4219";"Precisely. I'd do it myself, but one of those fetchers stabbed me when I tried to go after her.\n\nBesides, I, um, forgot to take the control rod and had to come back for it, anyway. Here."
"3952276-1-4224";"Ha! No. Lately, we've sighted savage creatures in the wastelands. They're more than a match for our tribe's hunters.\n\nGreat rewards await any hunter who can bring them to ground."
"3952276-1-4228";"I don't know, but when he came out from talking to our grandmaster, he was in charge. Our House Elves and slaves alike are terrified. \n\nPlease, hero, speak with our grandmaster. Maybe he'll listen to a new voice."
"3952276-1-4229";"I'm sorry, but the Indoril Vanguard demands my attention. \n\nPlease speak to my seneschal, <<1>>. She may be able to help you."
"3952276-1-4230";"If I survive, I'm resigning my position. After me, Holgunn is to be the commander of our forces in Stonefalls. \n\nThe Houses will have to promote another Dark Elf to my old position. Until then, Holgunn is the only one I trust to safeguard the Pact."
"3952276-1-4234";"Restore my reliquary. \n\nFind the pieces, scattered about the shrine and bring them to Master Aron at the central dais. When I am made whole, I can help you prevail against Vox."
"3952276-1-4238";"My husband, Boril, went back into the mine! What is he thinking? I'm sorry, what did you say? Help?\n\nYes, all right. I need aloe or redweed to make more potions. They grow all around here. You can forage for some, if you're willing."
"3952276-1-4241";"Turn this … tighten that … and … finished!\n\nThat should do it. Should we see what this thing does?"
"3952276-1-4247";"Strike a blow for the Three! A direct attack may convince them we're stronger than we appear.\n\nAnd any losses you inflict will improve our odds of holding them back immensely."
"3952276-1-4249";"The Hist Tree must be restored. If you can recover the three parts of my broken staff, we may be able to use magic to calm the spirits, and then we can do what we can for the tree itself. But beware—Argonian ghosts are unnatural and very dangerous."
"3952276-1-4252";"In time, comrade. First you and I must travel afield, to the ruined city Abagarlas. It was there the Ayleids went, to stop the Mortuum Vivicus. Together we will understand the threat to the present in the events of the past."
"3952276-1-4255";"Believe it or not, <<1>> and I are researching Argonian ruins, and the pirates are in our way. I'm sure they have plenty of loot, but that's not what we're after.\n\nIf you're interested, ask <<1>> to fill you in. He's watching the lower road."
"3952276-1-4256";"The artifacts below are dangerous. I need to review my notes and see if I can figure out what we're dealing with. Tell <<1>> to wait, or we may walk into some serious trouble."
"3952276-1-4257";"I heard pirates beg <<1>> for mercy. Then, screams. That's the other Fang's influence at work.\n\nI'll take the first Fang of Sithis to our secondary camp not far from here. Get the other Fang away from the pirates and meet me there."
"3952276-1-4259";"No. Well, not exactly. We want to search the ruins for ancient relics, and the pirates are in the way.\n\nMy partner, <<1>>, is up at our camp. He can tell you more about what we're after, if you're interested."
"3952276-1-4267";"We're waiting to depart for Shad Astula, the Academy of Magic.\n\nThe Academy sends invitations to only the most promising mages. Trains them to become leaders for the Houses and the Ebonheart Pact. My apologies, I thought that was common knowledge."
"3952276-1-4270";"The invaders put our library to the torch. However, I'm sure some of our lore has survived, as our most precious scrolls are treated with a flame-resistant unguent.\n\nRescue the scrolls and my fellow devotees: <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>."
"3952276-1-4271";"Yes, that should work!\n\n Find the houses in which they are trapped and save them."
"3952276-1-4273";"We feel … the council feels that we need to further investigate Jofnir's death. You will be their eyes and ears, with Aelif assisting you. She can explain in more detail when you speak to her."
"3952276-1-4276";"Those soldiers are terrorizing our people. Kill them! Rescue everyone you can, and please look for <<1>>.\n\nI don't know what the Dominion's doing here, but they said something about crystals. I'll sneak back in. Meet me near the village center."
"3952276-1-4279";"He was there one day and gone the next. His notes call this place ""Crow's Wood."" It's the only clue I have.\n\nI thought I saw an old house up the trail. Could you take a look? I need to stabilize this portal."
"3952276-1-4280";"Before you arrived, my visions revealed those three to me. They are to play an important part in future events directly related to the success of the Pact.\n\nHelp them. They must pass their tests and complete their training."
"3952276-1-4281";"There are supplies scattered throughout Selfora."
"3952276-1-4285";"We must take appropriate measures! I'll gather the students and make sure the grounds are secure.\n\nI'd like you to use the trapdoor to investigate the library vaults. I haven't heard from the librarian, and that fills me with nameless apprehension."
"3952276-1-4290";"She was a decorated soldier in the Ebonheart Pact. Now she tends to guests at the Ebony Flask. \n\nHer nightflower servants probably know her best. If you want to know how to get that bottle, talk to one."
"3952276-1-4292";"We tried to close the portals, but Vox was clever—she used dark magic to tie each portal to a watcher. You have to kill the watchers to close the portals. That's how many of us died. \n\nPlease close them, then find me by the central dais."
"3952276-1-4296";"Magistrix Vox attacked the shrine, but I don't know any more than that.\n\nSaint Veloth's fading spirit asked me to send help. He's on the stairs leading to the shrine, near the bridge to Tal'Deic Fortress. Hurry, before he vanishes forever."
"3952276-1-4297";"Then … well … things will go badly for you. Droppings on your shiny clothes. Yes, that's it! And incessant cawing! We'll keep you awake all through the night.\n\nDo not cross Blackfeather Court, intruder."
"3952276-1-4298";"Along the coast to the north lies the Ayleid ruin known as <<1>>.\n\nIf you please, investigate the ruin and bring back any interesting books you can find."
"3952276-1-4299";"Yes! Yes! Grub grass? Could you? It grows at the base of a waterfall near here. Meanwhile, I'll work on the brew.\n\nThe river always provides."
"3952276-1-4302";"By all means. ""Circus of Cheerful Slaughter"" is just there on the desk. \n\nBut be careful. The treachery of the Mad God knows no bounds."
"3952276-1-4303";"<<1>> is trying to break into the mine. We have to get in there. People are trapped inside, and we need to understand what in Oblivion the Reach are up to!"
"3952276-1-4304";"Deep in the mine, in an ancient Companion tomb … the Reachmen shamans went into the tomb, then the clansmen used two relics to seal the entrance. Their leaders are in the tomb, but you need those relics to get in."
"3952276-1-4305";"Yes! They led <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>> away through the mines. Find them, please!"
"3952276-1-4307";"Yes, the cultists drove my family away! Gjakil, my husband. My two daughters, <<1>> and <<2>>.\n\nI … I'm afraid to go after them. Will you look for them?"
"3952276-1-4308";"I don't know. And I can feel my mind slipping away. Please, help me. Find my mentor, the great <<1>>. She was at my performance. If anyone knows what's happening, she will. Hurry!"
"3952276-1-4311";"There's folk buried under rubble, and fires everywhere. My healers tell me we need to burn the dead. They don't want disease to spread. It's a mess."
"3952276-1-4314";"It gets worse, they're … doing something. To the Reachmen. \n\nI need to keep watch for any other soldiers coming through. Talk to Dajaheel and the Centurion if you want to pitch in. Good luck."
"3952276-1-4315";"I think so - <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. They took them away, might still be alive. Now get me out!"
"3952276-1-4316";"Yes! They led <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>> away through the mines. Please find them."
"3952276-1-4317";"Yes! They led <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>> away through the mines. Please find them."
"3952276-1-4318";"It is. They can use it to fuel a Daedric summoning ritual! I can repair it and seal it away, but you must retrieve its pieces, first."
"3952276-1-4320";"I don't know. All I know is them dreamers better not be scratchin' up my crystal shards. Can you kill some of them Dreamers and get my crystal shards back?"
"3952276-1-4321";"Yes, they broke my crystal into 5 parts. I know a wizard that can repair the crystal but I need all 5 shards that these rogues have."
"3952276-1-4322";"Collect the five shards, so that my wizard might repair and secure the crystal."
"3952276-1-4323";"They shattered the crystal into five shards. I need you to recover the crystal shards  for me."
"3952276-1-4326";"Outside of town, dark shamans disturb the dead, imbuing their bodies with corruption. Use this talisman to draw out the magicka and return the dead to peace. See me when the talisman is full."
"3952276-1-4327";"Yes, please cut me loose. And I'll meet you outside the camp."
"3952276-1-4329";"Well if you want the Supernal Dreamers to rule the wrld, then no. Otherwise free me."
"3952276-1-4333";"I promise not to tell."
"3952276-1-4334";"Please hurry. This whole situation is terribly embarassing."
"3952276-1-4335";"Not always. Sometimes I get rescued. \nIt never lasts."
"3952276-1-4336";"Thank you! Meet me near <<1>>."
"3952276-1-4340";"He's very mean."
"3952276-1-4342";"Find and kill Remelie, the leader of the Supernal Dreamers. That should send them fleeing back to Stormhaven."
"3952276-1-4343";"Well, how about you kill him?"
"3952276-1-4344";"Yes, you have to stop him."
"3952276-1-4345";"Not at all, fangless. This isn't the first time Cloggg has misappropriated my bongos."
"3952276-1-4346";"I'm … I'm fine, adept. I'm just tired. It's become very draining to translate these tomes. Don't worry about me. I can open the portal to the Isles for you straight away. Shalidor should be waiting. If you'll allow me?"
"3952276-1-4350";"Someone has to tell Ordinator Kilao what happened here. You appear to be available for the job. \n\nI'm sure we'll run into each other again. Hopefully, it won't be because your name's on a contract."
"3952276-1-4352";"Get my books back! Her nightmares crawled all over the shelves, pulled out anything that referenced herself or her Dreamers. Now they're out there in the cold, getting ratty."
"3952276-1-4353";"They're appearing all across Deshaan. Even Narsis is in danger.\n\nI need to stay here and finish my investigation. If you're heading south, would you carry a message to Guard Verilu at Narsis? She needs to know what happened here."
"3952276-1-4354";"Get me books back! Her nightmares crawled all over the shelves, pulled out anything that referenced herself or her Dreamers. Now they're out there in the cold, getting ratty."
"3952276-1-4355";"Your first priority: get pressure off of the troops. Help out the soldiers on the front lines, as best you can. Then locate <<1>>. We can't lose another capable officer."
"3952276-1-4357";"My dying wish. I want them to pay. The leaders of the three tribes here—Boneshaper, Rageclaw, Stonetalon. Kill them … and raise the Pact banner at the top of the hill. For me, please."
"3952276-1-4360";"Take this bucket. The well's between the houses, but beware those foul creatures. I tripped running away from them and injured my own arm!\n\nThree houses are ablaze. Please, put out the fires before everything burns to the ground!"
"3952276-1-4362";"I have a feeling that this is more than just another Yokudan ruin—it's massive, and the runes I've seen hint that something vital awaits inside!\n\nI need to get into the sealed inner chamber. Would you be willing to help me?"
"3952276-1-4365";"To the east of Mournhold lies Selfora, a quiet village known for its independent spirit.\n\nVox almost certainly passed through there. Start your search in Selfora."
"3952276-1-4366";"Oh, I thought it was obvious. We kill you, sort of. These Graveborn hearts … yes, imbuing their essence into a potion. Like so.\n\nDrink this. Trust me, nothing will go wrong!"
"3952276-1-4379";"Some survivors still hold out near the shrines. You get out there and rally them into the Hall. \n\nI'm going straight up the middle. We'll hold the door … and wait for you to make our move."
"3952276-1-4383";"Then work with <<1>>. She'd have the bodies already if the lamia cave didn't stink of death. She's blind, you see, but still a Shadowscale.\n\nMark the bodies with this paste. She'll track the scent and sneak the bodies from the lamia cave."
"3952276-1-4384";"I guess. Why else would I be recruiting? The ruins are said to be infested with beasts of some type. I'm sure they'll pay for swords, and that will serve the good of the Pact.\n\nYou're a loyal citizen of the Pact, aren't you?"
"3952276-1-4385";"I fear their intention may be to enslave Hakra's spirit.\n\nThere is still time though. Will you help? If you jab this shard into one of the cultists' corpses in the cave, Hakra can possess the body and then she can tell us what to do to stop them."
"3952276-1-4387";"I don't even know if he's alive. And they stole all our equipment too. I know it sounds dumb, caring about that stuff.\n\nPlease find him! And grab our equipment, if you see any of it."
"3952276-1-4390";"No! Not Ulrich! He's just hurt, or captured!\n\nThey tore apart our camp, scattering our things, including his journal. Those pages may lead you to Ulrich himself. Gather them up and see. Please."
"3952276-1-4391";"Now there's a plan. If you bag him, I'll toss you some coin for your trouble. \n\nAs I made my escape, some stuff fell out of my pack. You should be able to follow what I dropped like a trail back to his lair."
"3952276-1-4392";"No. No! Follow me. I'll show you."
"3952276-1-4393";"How are you at subterfuge? I'll stay here and keep an eye on these bandits.\n\nYou take the uniform from our friend here. Get down among the shacks and see what's going on."
"3952276-1-4394";"Save my crew. If I know spiders, my comrades are already in cocoons. \n\nFind <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Set them free."
"3952276-1-4397";"I have an idea, but we must confer with Merric. He's returned to the Earth Forge, to finish work on the Prismatic Core. Aelif is ready to open a portal, take us straight to his side. Are you prepared?"
"3952276-1-4398";"Tribunal willing. I've studied a map of the tomb's layout, but I never dared to enter.\n\nThis place is old. The original inhabitants of Bleakrock rest inside … and not quietly."
"3952276-1-4399";"If Shor's willing, yes. I brought a bag of incense to burn as an offering. The bone men got me before I could try the ritual.\n\nYou might have better luck. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-4400";"Stick the chieftain's head on a spike, somewhere the whole tribe can see. Then lead them to attack the dreugh.  \n\nOnce the dreughs' king is dead, we'll be free to explore. And to reward you handsomely, of course."
"3952276-1-4402";"No one knows. He takes people who enter Orkey's Hollow. Now he's taken my brother.\n\nI should stop sharpening this blade. You must go inside. I just can't."
"3952276-1-4405";"Just focus on the task at hand. I've prepared the ritual space, as you can see. Here are the books. Take them, and place them on the pillars of light around the Hall. \n\nThey'll focus the power of the books for the Archmage."
"3952276-1-4413";"How are you at subterfuge? I'll stay here and keep an eye on these bandits.\n\nTake the uniform from our friend here. Then get down into the mine shacks and see what's going on."
"3952276-1-4415";"I'm going to rally the villagers and get them ready to go. \n\nFind Tillrani when you're done at the tower. She'll hold the way open. She knows where to go."
"3952276-1-4429";"A former master named <<1>> now serves as the overseer. It is a shameful change of title, little more, but she knows these mines better than anyone.\n\nMe? I'd probably spit on her snout. It's better for you to talk to her."
"3952276-1-4430";"<<1>> runs the place. She was the former master here before the Pact. She is knowledgeable about the mine. Unfortunately, we're not on good speaking terms.\n \nYou have no history here. You can talk to her."
"3952276-1-4442";"I don't know. This is the first time the giants have ventured this close to the village … and the first time they've attacked us.\n\nMy brother Skorvild is assembling a force of warriors to drive off the giants. You should speak to my brother."
"3952276-1-4446";"He entered a house, but then ran back out holding his side. That's when I saw Daedra everywhere! <<1>>  headed toward the other side of the village, chased by them!\n\nPlease take this bucket and get water from the well to douse the fires!"
"3952276-1-4448";"I'm going to rally folks here and in Dhalmora. Get the battle-ready mustered. Send the non-combatants to safety with Darj.\n\nNow hurry. The fate of Davon's Watch depends on you."
"3952276-1-4449";"Of course! Guar are noble creatures. And they're hard workers. You've got to find them!\n\nHere, take some <<z:1>>. It's their favorite food. Their stomachs will lead them home. Home to me!"
"3952276-1-4461";"You have the heart of Ysgramor. Go out into the courtyard and help the Pact soldiers.\n\nYou've seen more combat than most of these milk drinkers. Show them what you know."
"3952276-1-4466";"Well, no. Not after that traveling merchant came by and told us that terrible story. He said dark witches had killed the Keepers of the shrine. The place has been overrun!\n\nI can match steel with any soldier, but how do you battle a witch's hex?"
"3952276-1-4477";"That's right. When a betty or netchling feels threatened, it secretes a kind of oil that provokes a bull's rage.\n\nI collected some oil and coated these sterile netch eggs with it. Throw them at the Daggers. The netch bulls should attack them."
"3952276-1-4478";"More than you know. They killed my wife, Inga. She was Old Man Voljar's daughter. I plan to reopen the meadery. My brothers came to help.\n\nWe need to get rid of the Stormfists and gather the ingredients Roruld needs to start fermenting mead again."
"3952276-1-4480";"Kazok's camp is up the path behind the barn. Take out more of his troops along the way and that ought to make Kazok angry enough to appear and face you.\n\nWhen he shows up, kill him. Then we can stick his head on one of these pikes!"
"3952276-1-4483";"Hold up. Captain Rana learned of a second force headed to the Bal Foyen docks. She's leading a group of warriors to repel that attack, but without aid ….\n\nI'm afraid you must choose."
"3952276-1-4486";"Well, the wolves came to Lower Yorgrim after the giants attacked. They roam the streets and feast on our dead.\n\nPerhaps you could collect a few wolf pelts for me. I can turn them into blankets. At least those of us that survived can stay warm."
"3952276-1-4504";"My fighters are exhausted, but if you push into the caves and clear out the spiders, we'll use fire to destroy their eggs. If Guardian Sud-Hareem is still alive, we need to find him. \n\nJust don't listen to the whispers. They'll drive you mad!"
"3952276-1-4506";"If you're smart, you'll stay away from there. I don't see any good coming out of that place for the foreseeable future. \n\nBut if you really want to help, find Eiraki Frostwind. She's at the fishing camp down the road."
"3952276-1-4507";"There's one thing I haven't tried yet. There's a flower that's been known to cure a fever. It's called Kyne's Breath. It grows around the rune stones that decorate the grove.\n\nA handful may help save Droi's life. Can you get some for me?"
"3952276-1-4508";"You can't reason with Daedric witches! We've all suffered losses, but they took my soldiers and turned them into mindless slaves! I can't forgive her for that.\n\nThey need to die! Every last one of them. I … argh! What's wrong with me?"
"3952276-1-4509";"Of course! In addition to attending the Konunleikar, the Pact leaders have important business to attend to. Important business!\n\nNow hurry along. You can find Thane Mera at the center of town, right in front of the Palace of Ysgramor."
"3952276-1-4510";"The Stormfist clan hasn't been seen in a decade, but they returned for these games. Since then, there have been numerous injuries and a few deaths. And there are rumors of worse things prowling the shadows.\n\nThe clan stays at the Cold Moon Inn."
"3952276-1-4511";"I want you to enter the next event—the Footrace of the Nine Holds. I name you Windhelm's new Champion. That should confuse our enemies.\n\nIf you're willing, go talk to the race organizer, Lenning. He's along the western wall."
"3952276-1-4514";"What does any exile want? Needless to say, to announce his presence in this manner can't bode well for King Jorunn.\n\nThe final event has started in the Hall of Trials. I'll send guards to the camp. You need to go to the hall and help the king!"
"3952276-1-4517";"Nords, if you can believe it. They bear the markings of the Stormfist clan, and they captured a few of our soldiers during the battle.\n\nIf you can set the soldiers free, we can try to take back the barracks. Rendezvous with me there."
"3952276-1-4518";"Koruni sent word that she plans to sneak into the central barracks. If you could liberate the soldiers that were captured during the battle, you could assist the lieutenant when she tries to retake the barracks."
"3952276-1-4522";"I fear there will be more. Rumors swirl of a necromancer named Atirion living in Howling Cave, next to the graveyard. I think he's responsible for this.\n\nWould you go there and end this threat?"
"3952276-1-4523";"Or what's left of her. Whatever state she's in, please bring her back."
"3952276-1-4527";"The Gray Vipers make their lair in the ruins of Nornalhorst, to the south. These bandits preyed on many of the refugees who made it to Vlastarus. Would you go to the ruins to see if you can recover any stolen items?"
"3952276-1-4528";"Speak to the highest-ranking Pact leader in the camp—General Yeveth Noramil of the Dark Elves and Eyes-of-Steel of the Argonians.\n\nSee what we can do to demonstrate the strength of the Pact."
"3952276-1-4529";"The Nords usually do this for me, but they got distracted. Happens all the time. Probably the mead they never stop guzzling. \n\nHere's a torch. Use a campfire to light it. Then light the fires near the south and east gates."
"3952276-1-4535";"Well, there you have it. Thievery and desecration. Still, these orders seem to imply there's more to it than that. \n\nPerhaps you could go below, return these items, and make sure everything is all right. The entrance is behind this building."
"3952276-1-4537";"We had visitors yesterday. Some of them looked pretty shifty. Jurana thought they might be bandits. After they left, I noticed that my banner was missing.\n\nThere's a bandit camp in the old towers west of here. Would you go look for my banner?"
"3952276-1-4539";"They were everywhere. All around us! There were so many of them. I—\n\nBy the Three! Look out!"
"3952276-1-4540";"We need anyone who can lift a sword or cast a spell to travel to the Front and join in the fighting.\n\nReport to Cyrodiil right away. I can even teleport you there. Speak with <<1>>. She'll give you your orders."
"3952276-1-4541";"Those cultists need to be taught a lesson!  Kill them and take what's left of my Crystal back.  I'll get my personal wizard to put it back together…"
"3952276-1-4542";"Start with Thane Harvald. He's a close friend of my father's. If any of the thanes can be counted on, it's Harvald."
"3952276-1-4544";"A mage crafted this crystal. It is attuned to the flame atronachs at <<1>> and will absorb their essences. When you kill an atronach, the crystal does the rest. Will you take it and rid us of some of these atronachs?"
"3952276-1-4545";"First we gather baskets of fresh apples and bags of hearty grain, then we burn them on the sacrifical altar, in his honor. \n\nAfter that, comes the feast! Help us gather the offering and I'll see that you get a seat of honor!"
"3952276-1-4549";"The Stormfists captured the giants' mammoths. They plan to use them against Fort Amol. If you oppose the Stormfists, then you are an ally of the big folk.\n\nTake this horn and blow it at the nearby cave. It will summon a giant to your side."
"3952276-1-4550";"We think Fildgor wants to use the dragonshrine to steal Queen Nurnhilde's soul and force the Crown of Freydis to recognize him as the true ruler of Skyrim.\n\nMeet Scout Snowhunter to the north and east. He'll show you how to reach Skuldafn."
"3952276-1-4551";"Ah, you've never been here, have you? This is a temple to the spinners, the Bosmer who make reality with their tales.\n\nLet me take you to <<1>> in <<2>>, and perhaps you'll see why the story must be corrected."
"3952276-1-4552";"The Dremora killed many of my circle. Their undead bones wander these tunnels, clutching the gems we used in the ceremony. \n\nBring me some of them. If the Dremora is banished, I can use them to prevent him from ever returning to this realm."
"3952276-1-4557";"We guard the ancient burial site of Ouze from those who'd disturb the spirits. But that part of the story's not important yet! You have to save her!\n\nGo along the road. Look for the altar in the water. Please!"
"3952276-1-4561";"Warlord Lob and his lieutenants have made the arena at the heart of Cradlecrush their headquarters. Use the horn there to sound our attack and strike fear into the invaders' hearts!"
"3952276-1-4563";"You should join us! It'll be a night to remember. We even have a bard! He was passing by and agreed to perform at the party. \n\nGo talk to Berj Stoneheart, right up the road. He's our overseer. I'm sure he'll let you crash the party."
"3952276-1-4566";"I was a soldier before joining the work crew. My sword and shield saw me through many battles. But I am a shadow of my former self. The creatures took my items and left me to die.\n\nI want my sword and shield with me for my final journey."
"3952276-1-4567";"We guard the ancient burial site of Ouze from those who'd disturb the spirits. But that part of the story's not important yet! You have to save her!\n\nGo along the road. Look for the altar in the water. Please!"
"3952276-1-4572";"Not this time. But I fear <<1>> now plots against us.\n\nMy daughter was in shock after the attack. She refused to speak to me. Please, see if <<2>> will tell you anything. Someone must stop the Drublog before they move against us!"
"3952276-1-4575";"Well, my sister went into the ruins and hasn't returned yet. She can take care of herself, but I'm starting to get worried.\n\nKireth keeps a journal, but she's hard on her books. Always loses pages. Follow the pages and they'll lead you right to her!"
"3952276-1-4576";"That's why I'm coming with you, silly! I won't let anything happen to you. Promise! Besides, I have the shovel!\n\nAnyway, you keep the constructs away from me and I'll dig for the key. How's that sound?"
"3952276-1-4578";"He believes we should embrace the bloodlust, the power. Taking those who can't oppose us and making them our own.\n\nAs civil war rages through Eastmarch, he feels the time is right to strike. He wants to grow an army of undead before anyone notices."
"3952276-1-4579";"You're serious? I have mentioned the swarms of Daedra, have I not?\n\nThere are … if you're willing to risk your life, there are other Keepers who may need help. I imagine the High Kinlord sent more against us than the banekin who harangued me."
"3952276-1-4580";"It's the most sacred site in Deepwoods, and the reason the first villagers chose this site.\n\nCome with me! I'll show you the shrine and tell you more of our history."
"3952276-1-4582";"They got in behind the temple building to the southwest. <<1>> has taken command of its defenses. Even with the spirits and healed soldiers, I fear we'll be overrun.\n\nThis is a fight for our lives!"
"3952276-1-4584";"Hmm, maybe you can help me out. The cooks, Kalogar and Heggvir are arguing over what to serve. They want me to choose, but I hate to pick favorites. \n\nKalogar wants to serve steaks, Heggvir says goat stew. You can pick."
"3952276-1-4587";"Heard 'em screaming near the forge. Think it was the monkey, but could've been the bearded lady. \n\nLook, if you're heading in, we could use help. I'd hate to have to leave all my performers behind."
"3952276-1-4588";"Well, he's been tied up a while! I'm sure you'll be fine. Mostly.\n\nWe'll show those brigands what it means to toy with the Dancing Scrib. Their ship will soon be ours!"
"3952276-1-4591";"Not dead. At least not yet. But his soul struggles as his dreams turn to poison. They tear at him, pull him deeper into the darkness.\n\nOne calling himself Dreamwalker claims he can enter his nightmare. With our magic, he says your king can be saved."
"3952276-1-4592";"Skuldafn is extremely defensible. It won't be easy to get our army up there. Still, Fildgor the Exile won't wait for us to get into position. He has his own timetable to keep, I'm sure.\n\nGood luck up there."
"3952276-1-4593";"The Watcher at the Bridge guards the entrance. I will speak on your behalf and you shall be able to enter Sovngarde as my champion.\n\nWhen you reach the peak, step into the column of light. The rest is up to you."
"3952276-1-4594";"Can you check on my family? We have three logging cabins scattered around Bonestrewn Crest. Look for my brother, my cousin, and my wife.\n\nI can sneak around, but I can't fight draugr in this state. Please, make sure my family is all right."
"3952276-1-4596";"Dead or hiding, doesn't matter. I need to stop the Sea Vipers from breaching the ruins until the Thalmor reinforcements arrive.\n\nThey have a sky-key in their camp. It'll let them walk right into the ruins, unless you get it first. Interested?"
"3952276-1-4599";"I can give you insight to each of our gods before you enter King Jorunn's dreams. That's about all I can do from here.\n\nOnce you enter the dream, you will be on your own. I'll attempt to keep his life force stable for as long as I can."
"3952276-1-4600";"<<1>>, the farm's matron. I saw her run for the barn. She's got the soul of Ysgramor. She wouldn't have left anyone behind."
"3952276-1-4601";"<<1>> is there. She's the farm's matron.\n\nShe ran for the barn while … while we were trying to escape."
"3952276-1-4602";"I need you to rescue my advisors. They can tell you more about the attack and perhaps help you free me from my prison. I'm being weakened by some powerful magic. \n\nThey won't be much use to you as fighters, but they're very clever."
"3952276-1-4604";"We need weapons. Overpower a few Stormfists, grab their weapons, and give them to my husband, Jomund. He's in the mine.\n\nAnd set some of the miners free along the way. Look for my siblings, Tridi and Nedrek. I need to know they're safe."
"3952276-1-4606";"We hid the sample and our research notes, but I think the magister is suspicious. She's looking for something back there.\n\nI'd like you to retrieve the research notes and the ore sample."
"3952276-1-4607";"The Maormer bound the captain and some crew, then took them away. They killed those who didn't dive overboard, like I did, and captured several others as they swam ashore.\n\nI fear the Maormer will torture their captives if they aren't rescued soon!"
"3952276-1-4608";"I've sent a striker to assist you inside the cave's entrance. My remaining crew and I will secure the exit.\n\nBe wary. The Maormer feared the very mention of <<1>>. Light of Aldmeris guide you."
"3952276-1-4609";"Burn the Maormer sailboats. The rowboats aren't a threat to our fleet. We can take our time with those.\n\nLook for me on the hillside above our shipwreck when you're done. I'll be at my favorite overlook. You can't miss it."
"3952276-1-4611";"Yes! Go after the Worm Cultists. Break the geodes and release these poor souls.\n\nAnd see that my husband gets to Sovngarde."
"3952276-1-4612";"Crush every geode you find, youngin. Start with the one in this bloody bag. That'll send my family to Sovngarde and our damned-well deserved reward!"
"3952276-1-4613";"Here, take this cold water. Most of them are lolling around in a stupor now. Toss it on the mammoths to wake them up.\n\nThey'll be cantankerous and you'll have to defend yourself, but they'll run on home once you've beaten some sense into them."
"3952276-1-4614";"She swears something pulled him into one of the canals. Poor thing's shocked out of her gourd. As you can see, I'm a little occupied. Get Yiri talking. Tell the Pact's commander, Centurion Andrin, what you learn."
"3952276-1-4616";"Perhaps you could take care of that last little bit of business for us?  Get rid of the threat and destroy their orders. \n\nWe've had enough trouble here to last a lifetime."
"3952276-1-4618";"Can you meet me by Cold Cave when you're done? It's right below our feet, so to speak. The entry's on the hillside.\n\nYou can't miss the cold air coming from it. Promise you'll meet me there?"
"3952276-1-4619";"The Companions' Hall, our ancient headquarters. It perches on the mountainside above Shor's Stone. \n\nWe must see if any are left to save. And then we take the Hall back. Can I count on you?"
"3952276-1-4620";"That would be extremely helpful. The Argonian, Aleeto, is an alchemist. She tinkers with metals and crystals and dabbles in all kinds of magic. She'd be able to identify the metal.\n\nYou can find her in the Alchemist Shop in Fort Amol."
"3952276-1-4621";"Many have gone to Sovngarde today, many more will follow unless we close the portals and stop Thallik Wormfather. \n\nNo ordinary soldier can deal with this. For this task, I need you."
"3952276-1-4622";"Take this supply of bandages. They're treated with an herbal mixture. Should get the wounded back on their feet. Know that our soldiers have traveled through the portals. I'm sure wounded lie there, as well. Thank you, my friend."
"3952276-1-4623";"I hope not, but who can say? Could you watch for any of Fildgor's soldiers? A courier, maybe? \n\nWe don't want word about that mysterious metal reaching the wrong ears."
"3952276-1-4624";"Yes! That Hircine-worshiper wants to keep me from the handfast.\n\nMy scouts saw his Houndsmen in the ravine below, bearing silver shards that radiate magicka. Can you wrest the shards from them? They're key to unlocking the city, and this puzzle."
"3952276-1-4625";"Some of the Houndsmen didn't like our music. I think they know it's a music of freedom and joy!\n\nTheir werewolves attacked us while we were practicing! We escaped into this ravine, but got separated. Are they even alive?"
"3952276-1-4626";"I don't know. The hengekeeper may. I sense her nearby, in the roots below.\n\nPlease, seek out the hengekeeper. Put an end to whatever darkness shadows our holy grove!"
"3952276-1-4627";"Almalexia bless you! I'll follow your lead, but I'm afraid I'm not very good in a fight."
"3952276-1-4628";"The delvers found an ancient puzzle and gathered notes about it - clues. The Worms killed the delvers to get their notes. Whatever they're after, we can't let them get it.\n\nSave who you can, but we need those notes."
"3952276-1-4631";"That's not for me to say. I don't even want to guess.\n\nCommander Yjarnn might have an idea, but you'd have to get it out of him. Whatever the King's business is though, it must be urgent to call the various leaders of the Pact together so suddenly."
"3952276-1-4632";"The pickled fish from Lower Yorgrim and the mead from Voljar's have not yet arrived. Worse, my Dark Elf assistant never returned with my fancy Dunmer clothing from Mournhold.\n\nEverything goes wrong, and I am stuck here doing organizing things!"
"3952276-1-4633";"I don't see how I can get through to Selos without help. He's probably at the bottom of the mine, beyond all these invaders. \n\nWe're going to have to cut our way through. If we kill the thugs' leaders, they'll probably run for it."
"3952276-1-4634";"I understand. But if there's even a chance …."
"3952276-1-4635";"Of course. Your presence is requested. That's what happens when you attract fame and fortune. \n\nUnless you plan to run across the sea, I suggest you find the boatmaster."
"3952276-1-4638";"Yes, and after all <<1>> did for us, we should repay her kindness.\n\nI need to stay here and wait for the others. <<1>> told us to meet here. Can you search <<2>> and rescue her?"
"3952276-1-4639";"By Baan Dar's ears, of course <<1>> speaks!\n\nLook for stars on the walls, and poetry for a warrior. I tried, but I cannot read. Those traitors said the words can solve the puzzle. Please, free me from this tomb."
"3952276-1-4640";"Aye! Our thane is a masterful warrior. Killed the horker all on her own. \n\nI need to see to my post. You should speak to Fjora. Her hall is just up the stairs, off the main square."
"3952276-1-4646";"Thane Unnvald. Unnvald Ironhand? He was granted the fortress when he retired. You can try to talk to him if you want, but—well, with all we've been through, he's not glad of visitors."
"3952276-1-4648";"I can't write, I'm a spinner! I talk! Forget parchment. We need to invoke the ancient rites of flesh and blood.\n\nWith hoarvor blood, and a chunk of Old Tusk's flesh, the tale can write itself!"
"3952276-1-4652";"The Shards of Wuuthrad have been scattered across the Smokefrosts. Be watchful. Recover any fragments you find on your journey. \n\nIn Riften, speak to <<1>>. Tell her I sent you."
"3952276-1-4653";"The Vicecanons need an outside party to help due to certain … political complications. <<1>> expects me to send help."
"3952276-1-4654";"They're tormenting them! Driving them mad! They must know the spriggans are the true guardians of the grove.\n\nYou've got to help them before they're completely destroyed!"
"3952276-1-4655";"<<1>> led the charge after the Reachmen attacked. I lost track of her in the battle and we got overrun. Get out there, ease the pressure on our troops, and look for Jardirr."
"3952276-1-4658";"They said they're dealing with the bandits, but don't believe me about Turil. He did this, I am certain!\n\nI'll pay you if you get my silk from him. I've looked for him throughout the town, except the Inn. I bet he's there."
"3952276-1-4667";"The sage-to-be and a companion must pray at Fallowstone's shrines. If she is acceptable to our ancestors, visions of the Five Hundred in their prime will appear. Will you accompany her?"
"3952276-1-4673";"Lead us. The soldiers here will all know Bonebane by sight, and they'll rally behind you.\n\nWhen the undead attacked, we lost four guardposts in the first attack. Take them back. Show the men we won't be intimidated!"
"3952276-1-4674";"I'll get myself captured, see what the prisoners know. You look for clues in the camp. Take this uniform. Put it on and you should be able to move around camp unmolested."
"3952276-1-4676";"There are three sisters, all nearby. Kill the twins first. Lure Dyta out with Reachman eyes. Kill Jadwiga's attendants and she'll attack. Then use the twins' heads to bring out the matriarch."
"3952276-1-4677";"Yes. Reinforcements from Windhelm brought the news. The King has gone to Fort Amol to meet with Pact dignitaries. \n\nTake word of our victory to the fort. Speak to Thane Oda Wolf-Sister there."
"3952276-1-4678";"No, I just know they're in trouble. They always seem to be. Please find them, help them out of whatever trouble they're in, and then come back here.\n\nMaybe start with <<1>>. She said she was going to a dragonshrine."
"3952276-1-4681";"Sss. <<1>>. If he still swims this part of the river, he may know what's going on."
"3952276-1-4694";"To rest and hold council with his advisors, no doubt. Thanes. Ebonheart Pact leaders. Other nobles, I'm sure.\n\nThere's a large camp to the northeast. The soldiers call it Jorunn's Stand. Not far from the place called Skuldafn."
"3952276-1-4697";"The cult, she says. Forces allied with you also gather at Honrich Tower.\n\nI will journey there, in my own way. You should travel there as well, my lord."
"3952276-1-4698";"Lower the Worms' defenses. Kill them as you must, but leave some for us. As you destroy each ward, we will secure the caves behind you.\n\nFor Ysgramor! For glory!"
"3952276-1-4700";"We must separate them. Great damage to Sinmur will tear their spirits asunder. Then both are vulnerable.\n\nEither the shards of Wuuthrad or mighty companions are needed for this task!"
"3952276-1-4702";"As we speak, two of my guardians investigate rumored anchor sites. Merric and Aelif are the best the guild has to offer. Meet up with them in the hills west of Davon's Watch. You can proceed from there."
"3952276-1-4713";"They wanted free mead. Can you believe it? Savages, the lot of them!\n\nMy brother Haraldar plans to get the meadery up and running again. If you want to lend a hand, talk to Haraldar. He's over by the farmhouse."
"3952276-1-4715";"The young ones' eyes shine at the thought, but I won't let their blood be shed for my actions.\n\nAnd to act, I must know the Gold Coast's plans. Perhaps you'd be willing to help?"
"3952276-1-4716";"Civilians are trapped in the Trade Hall and Mages Guild by the Drublog. Rescue them. The sergeant can arm them and organize a counterattack under the Fists of Thalmor banner.\n\nTell them to get to the Fighters Guild barracks. We'll meet them there."
"3952276-1-4717";"It's not as simple as that. But yes, that is the first step.\n\nTake this powder and add it to the kegs in their camp. I've taken the liberty of offering some of my own vintage to them. A gift for their valiant battle with the werewolves."
"3952276-1-4718";"Much as I want that bastard's blood on my sword, I can't. I told the lieutenant I'd protect the civilians.\n\nI'll start moving the militia toward the warehouse district. Meet me at the bridge when <<1>> is dead."
"3952276-1-4719";"It makes sense strategically, but we weren't prepared for this. We weren't expecting to fight a war while the Pact leaders were in council.\n\nI need your help. Captain Hamar sent the runner. Report to him. Find out what's going on at the fort."
"3952276-1-4720";"I would, but I lost very specialized tools. I fear the Drublog took them, or hid them among these burnt-out ruins. Can you retrieve them for me?\n\nI'll make my way toward the docks. I could meet you in the warehouse district there."
"3952276-1-4721";"""He told us his plan to ascend Forelhost, and search the crypts of the Dragon Priests. There was muttering in the ranks. Cowards. Why should we fear the dead? The dead are toys to the likes of us!"""
"3952276-1-4722";"Fight the serpent women by ourselves? They are too terrible!\n\nWill you help? Find my sisters. Perhaps, together, we can drive out the lamias."
"3952276-1-4723";"An old cult. Worship totem gods. Call them monks or witches as you will, but they wield strong healing magic.\n\nTheir rituals are complex, and those who seek their help must bring their own ritual components."
"3952276-1-4724";"My friend Grida heard about some special bath salts. They're made at the Darkwater Crossing apothecary. She went to get some, but she hasn't returned.\n\nSee if you can find her. Or better yet, just bring us those salts!"
"3952276-1-4725";"Well, I would be foolish to turn down help, wherever it comes from.\n\nI need certain materials to perform the ritual. Can you gather them for me?"
"3952276-1-4726";"My sister took it. She was going to hide it, keep it safe. But … I don't think she made it very far.\n\nAwyn fled south, through the mountain pass. Find her. Save the Sigil, and our accord."
"3952276-1-4730";"They're agents of The Veiled Heritance, I'm sure of it! Teldur, my father's assistant, is trying to organize a defense. \n\nYou look capable. Will you help Silsailen?"
"3952276-1-4732";"I long for my daughters to be returned to me.\n\nDuring the war, my husband's mind broke. He murdered our daughters. To save them from Akaviri torture, he claimed. He scattered their remains across Eastmarch. And left me here alone."
"3952276-1-4734";"Get me books back! Her nightmares crawled all over the shelves, pulled out anything that referenced herself or her Dreamers. Now they're out there in the cold, getting ratty."
"3952276-1-4738";"If danger doesn't find her, she'll seek it out and invite it home to dinner. \n\nShe's in the ruins just ahead, conspiring with the Battlereeve. They're determined to complete the ceremony. Do be a loyal subject and see that she survives. Won't you?"
"3952276-1-4739";"Those are the rules. The one rabbit. He's quick. I call him Golden Jack. You nab him, you win.\n\nGrab the bow by the river and let me know when you're ready to start."
"3952276-1-4740";"I can make it back to Vulkhel Guard. You have to find <<1>>. She'll know what to do. \n\nShe's a prisoner at the Maormer camp down the beach. Please … hurry."
"3952276-1-4741";"Stars, yes. Andewen and her team are somewhere in the ruins, looking for the Mallari-Mora. They're long overdue.\n\nIf you're not here with supplies, perhaps you'd go look for them?"
"3952276-1-4742";"Take this crystal. I've etched a series of microrunes onto its surface. Weaken the spirit's hold on the physical world and then focus your will.\n\nThat should sever the spirit's hold on Nirn. Allow it to pass into Aetherius."
"3952276-1-4744";"Our home, the Canonreeve's residence. Teldur's quarters are there, as well. Please, you must go there, quickly! I fear for my father's life!"
"3952276-1-4746";"As you saw today, my reign so far has been anything but normal. I worry there will be complications.\n\nAnd the presence of my newest Eye would assuage that worry."
"3952276-1-4748";"No, it doesn't, does it? There are dark forces at work here. \n\nI have a powerful Altmer Holy Symbol used for blessings at this site. I thought I might try using it on the stone, but I'm afraid I haven't the nerve. Would you be willing to try it?"
"3952276-1-4749";"Nimalten. Thane Fjora is a brave, intelligent woman. And she has the resources to protect the rest of the Ragged Hills. Grab a guardsman when you reach the town. They'll direct you where you need to go."
"3952276-1-4750";"It's an Ayleid ruin north of Fort Rayles. Be careful. I don't want your soul on my conscience as well."
"3952276-1-4753";"Yes! I dove into the water and swam ashore. I turned back and saw the captain and a few others being bound and taken away.\n\nThe Maormer must plan to interrogate them. Please you must help them!"
"3952276-1-4754";"They trussed up the captain and a few others, then hauled them away. The rest of us scattered overboard.\n\nThe Maormer aren't gentle with their captives. We've got to rescue them!"
"3952276-1-4755";"Their nearest camp is on an island west of here. I believe they took the claw there."
"3952276-1-4756";"The cultists! Aren't you listening? No time! Take whatever ivory you can find to <<1>>. And my notes—he'll want them. The cultists took so many carvings for their own purposes. Got to retrieve them somehow.\n\nThe poison … my time has come."
"3952276-1-4757";"Check the camps near Abamath's ruins for <<1>>. I'm not as worried about <<2>>. She can outrun anything, especially when she's scared.\n\nAnd watch out for the Worm Cult. They've taken over <<3>>."
"3952276-1-4762";"I know. It gets worse. They're doing … something to the Reachmen in those rituals. I have to keep my post. Report in to Dajaheel. Tell her I sent you."
"3952276-1-4763";"It gets worse. The Reachmen are being … changed. The Worms are performing rituals all past the treeline. Look, I need to keep my post here.\n\nSpeak to Dajaheel at our forward camp if you want to pitch in."
"3952276-1-4764";"Oh, there we go. North side of town was hit hard. There are people trapped under rubble, fires everywhere. Then there's the corpses. There's no time to bury them. Healers want them burned before disease starts spreading."
"3952276-1-4767";"She's probably on the road near the Vale of the Guardians.\n\nThere are terrible things in the woods and we're not warriors. Could you find her and make sure that she's safe?"
"3952276-1-4774";"I was a warrior before I became queen. I can handle myself. \n\nBut you're determined. And I know you're foolhardy enough. I would welcome your company."
"3952276-1-4775";"I borrowed this wine from Sanguine's private stock. It controls the dead. Pour it on the remains of the entertainers, then command their ghosts to go back to work. \n\nIf they resume their old jobs, I can finally get out of here."
"3952276-1-4776";"Please. He usually camped at Coldcorn Ruin to the east.\n\nI hope he hasn't fallen afoul of bandits, or worse, on the road."
"3952276-1-4782";"Yes, please. If the lich isn't destroyed, evil will spread from Lindai, consuming all in its path. I have no doubt this is the Shadowed Path's plan."
"3952276-1-4783";"Hurry. You need fire to stay alive up here. And watch out for the cats, too. I'd hate for us both to die up here."
"3952276-1-4785";"They store their supplies in an abandoned warehouse west of here. Would you please go taint their food with this poison? That should slow them down."
"3952276-1-4786";"A necromancer—goes by the name Garron. Don't know how long they had him in their pocket. For all I know, he's the ringleader.\n\nWhen we came through the entrance, he and a group of deviants ambushed us. He took the others inside—left me for dead."
"3952276-1-4787";"One of the villagers you rescued said he saw bound men being herded into the cellar of a house north of the village square. I can't leave my post, but perhaps you could investigate?"
"3952276-1-4791";"The first riddle, then:\n\nI hold your twin within my face.\nI whirl your world around.\n\nIn me you see what others see.\nIn me the truth is found."
"3952276-1-4792";"Yes! To your inner spirit. The brew enables your unleashed spirit to see fires, gifts from Kyne herself!\n\nFollow the path of fire. But mind the scum weed; it'll slow you down."
"3952276-1-4793";"Look, there's a lot of blame to go around. I heard the thane. You're the new champion of the hall.\n\nAre you going to help those bards, or not?"
"3952276-1-4795";"Down in the valley behind me. The leader seemed to be this tall woman in robes; they called her ""Gullwig,"" or something like that. I'm … I'm not going back there. But you look like you could take her."
"3952276-1-4796";"Help? No. I don't think so. \n\nActually. My guardsmen are all tied up right now. If you're up to it, perhaps you could look into some things for me?"
"3952276-1-4798";"There's coin in it for you if you do! Let's see. Tanamo favors the tavern. Anala spars at the Fighters Guild, and Balithil was visiting the market. \n\nDon't know where Degail's gotten to. One of the others may know where she is."
"3952276-1-4800";"Not sure. The dead are beyond my ken, I'm afraid. She readies herself on the far side of Tanzelwil.\n\nI tried to convince her to return another day, but she's determined. Will you go to her? I fear for her life."
"3952276-1-4801";"I need something done, and I want you to do it. Besides, these spies threaten your Pact.\n\nFind the Aldmeri spies, make them drink from Sanguine's goblet, and I will reward you."
"3952276-1-4802";"I can hardly believe it, but reports indicate High Kinlady Estre is behind this. We hold the line here, but that could change at any moment.\n\nBattlereeve Urcelmo sent a runner requesting aid. He has a plan to deal with these beasts, apparently."
"3952276-1-4804";"Just so, my friend. Good luck in there. \n\nRaz will rejoin Urcelmo and the others. Ensure Firsthold is still here when you get back."
"3952276-1-4805";"It's hard for me to believe, but reports indicate High Kinlady Estre is behind this. We hold the line here, but that could change at any moment.\n\nBattlereeve Urcelmo sent a runner requesting aid. He has a plan to deal with these beasts, apparently."
"3952276-1-4806";"Just one less problem I have to deal with. If you take out some atronachs, I can concentrate on planning my revenge against the Black Daggers."
"3952276-1-4810";"No, I don't. I think he's hiding something. Those mercenaries? They guard his house night and day. \n\nPlease, I know you have no reason to trust me. But at least look? It's my son."
"3952276-1-4813";"Go to the central market and search Bar-Neeus's tent. Look for anything he might be hiding. Report back to me with your findings."
"3952276-1-4816";"He cackled something about the Vale. It lies just beyond this cave. I've tried to summon up the nerve. But I just can't.\n\nWill you go after them? I have these teleportation scrolls. You could use them, get everyone out."
"3952276-1-4817";"He is our clan's elder, and I am his apprentice. His worries weigh heavily upon him, and I wish to unburden him.\n\nIf you will help him, you will help us all."
"3952276-1-4818";"That must be what they're after! Stall us at Trolhetta. Gather the shards and grow in power.\n\nWe need those shards. Jorunn has things well in hand at Trolhetta. Find as many shards you can, as you make your way to the mountain."
"3952276-1-4819";"One of them has a song that gets stuck in my head. The other one is an incredibly pretentious sonnet.\n\nNeither one of them can assuage my endless ennui, but they've made this place more tolerable. Please read them and tell me what you think."
"3952276-1-4822";"Aye. Our Fjora's a tough one, she is. Cut that horker down where he stood.\n\nLook, I have to keep to my post. I'm sure the sergeant and our thane will want to speak with you. The hall is just up the stairs off of the main square."
"3952276-1-4823";"I've been tracking a dangerous Clan Matron of the Reach. She's meeting with a Covenant spy. Alone, I could take her. Here with her tribe, not a chance. Will you help?"
"3952276-1-4828";"Skald Skullsplitter! He wrote the greatest Nord epics this world has ever seen! He's a genius … and a brute.\n\nA scholarly High Elf like me wouldn't last long in that room. Could you get me a book? With an autograph? Maybe two?"
"3952276-1-4829";"Search the corpses. Personal items. Come back to me."
"3952276-1-4833";"Too slow for my liking. My advisor Borodin is at the inn, asking questions of the townfolk. My court mage, Golun, has a theory about the Worm Cult's plan. He's at the Mages Guild, doing research\n\nPerhaps you can give them a hand?"
"3952276-1-4834";"Some of our militia was out training when the attack came. When they returned … I tried to stop them, but they left for the Drublog camp. For vengeance!\n\nBut they've been gone too long, and my daughter Firwin left with them. I can't lose her, too."
"3952276-1-4835";"My fortress is besieged. Or haven't you noticed? No doubt a plot of the Dark Elves. The dead won't take me. The Elves won't break me. Take that news back to your Jarls!"
"3952276-1-4842";"Ha! A true warrior's instinct! Make their cowardly leader <<1>> take me to Anvil, and I'll share my treasure with you.\n\nOr … turn the tables. Beat them senseless, then ask for favors. It's always worked for me."
"3952276-1-4843";"Our home, the Canonreeve's residence. Teldur's quarters are there, as well. Please, you must go there, quickly! I fear for my father's life!"
"3952276-1-4844";"A trained investigator, are you? Not likely. Well, as long as you don't roll the bodies or destroy evidence, go ahead. \n\nIf you find anything, let me know right away."
"3952276-1-4846";"Hendil has been tending to the ill in Aninwe's barn. He's just the town alchemist! No formal healer training.\n\nYou want to risk your life? Be my guest. Whinnie and I are bound for Skywatch."
"3952276-1-4847";"The town alchemist has been tending the sick. In a local woman's barn, of all places. If you're determined to enter town, I won't stop you.\n\nJust mind yourself, hear?"
"3952276-1-4848";"Yes, Hendil took over my barn. Just the local alchemist. No formal healer training, but he's the best we have.\n\nIf you're looking to help, Stars watch your steps."
"3952276-1-4850";"Either that or there's some kind of bizzarely violent relay race going on."
"3952276-1-4851";"We thought it might be a sign the city was returning! When we got closer, we felt uncomfortable, unable to breathe. And then the lightning hit Barothlas, so we retreated.\n\nWhat do you think's going on in the valley?"
"3952276-1-4853";"Would you stop the ritual? We have a scout who can lead you to the ritual site."
"3952276-1-4855";"You contact agent Fistalle on the east side of town. This one pads around her house. Then, we meet to discuss her report.\n\nToo bad Raz is so handsome, yes? He would get noticed."
"3952276-1-4856";"Condalin's too observant. He knows we are here. If you go strolling in like the pompous hero, allow yourself to be taken, they'll let their guard down.\n\nThen old Raz finds you, frees you, and we strike!"

"3952276-1-4866";"The shrines themselves fuel this evil. I can feel it. Cleanse the shrines and you should be able to strike at the source of the corruption.\n\nI need to hold the ward here. I hate to ask, but …."
"3952276-1-4867";"Ancient guardians guard the relics, but they've already been touched by the Daedric stain. Please, master, get them clear?\n\nLook for the coffers on altars around the Torinaan. Just mind the guardians, now!"
"3952276-1-4869";"These are like no Spider Cultists I've faced before. They can turn flesh to shadow, and sedition to loyalty.\n\nThey've amassed a small army of shadow soldiers, ensnaring innocent people to their cause. This region will soon be overrun."
"3952276-1-4870";"Huh. Might be worth somethin'. If you find Varnedo, kill him. Make it painful. Then we'll see.\n\nBut if you cross me, I'll cut you in half."
"3952276-1-4872";"We heard that the bandit leader at Fort Greenwall has <<1>>. Would you reclaim it for us?"
"3952276-1-4875";"Get the wounded off the field. East of here is a supplies hut, with some Covenant uniforms.\n\nIf you can, pass out those uniforms, and the troops can use them to escape."
"3952276-1-4877";"We have to stop it! Who knows what foulness they might call down on us? Are you with us or not?"
"3952276-1-4885";"I'd be very grateful. Jofarr's so drunk he ran off after a draugr. Thought it was a girl he knew. I hope he didn't try to kiss it."
"3952276-1-4886";"Their names are Norald and Bivene. Borald and Nivene. There's two of them. We need to get back to the party. Woo-hoo!"
"3952276-1-4887";"I suppose I could use the help. Their names are Borald and Jofarr. Once we find them both, I can lead them out."

"3952276-1-4891";"Beasts! Death is all around me. The worst of them is <<1>>, a monster without equal!\n\nHe lairs in a fallen tree to the south. If only someone dared kill him for me!"
"3952276-1-4893";"Yep. Just scatter the hay a bit and they should fly out. But here's the thing: glowflies make fantastic fishing bait. Instead of just scaring 'em off, I want you to catch 'em. \n\nCan't be wasting good bait."
"3952276-1-4894";"There was a … misunderstanding. But I think I can make it right.\n\nI'm searching for the tomb of Lodorr, a necromancer of some renown. If you help me to raise and destroy him, I'll see to it that the King rewards you."
"3952276-1-4900";"Maybe. Can you get up there and stop whatever they're doing? They can't be up to any good."

"3952276-1-4909";"I did. And I will again, once Lodorr is destroyed. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-4910";"This crystal, take it. The Pact has unloaded arcane cargo all around the cove.\n\nSimply touch the crystal to the cargo. The results should be … impressive."
"3952276-1-4911";"Auri-El protect you. Before he died, this bastard told me she's held in some ruins.\n\nTake this note and this elixir of invisibility. The note holds everything I learned from this scum. The elixir's for Palith."
"3952276-1-4913";"Oh, fancy. Look, don't believe me? Go talk to Tanion, the headmaster. Ask that smug son of a bitch what this place is really like. Maybe someone with the Queen's ear can get a real look at this hole."
"3952276-1-4914";"Help? Sounds good to me, but I'm not in charge here.\n\nThe House leaders are probably bickering in the kinhouse even as we speak. Talk to one of them if you really want to get involved in this mess."
"3952276-1-4915";"Exactly! Up at the manse. He's eager to discuss all the things you'll do on your visit to Skywatch. Should be a lot of fun.\n\nEnjoy your time in the city."
"3952276-1-4916";"Their names are Hilka, Hald, and Fjar. They were taken off to be interrogated.\n\nFind out which one is the traitor and free the others—there should be interrogation transcripts up ahead. Leave the traitor to die. I'll meet you further up the hill."
"3952276-1-4917";"Before they were ambushed, my team identified three high-ranking Bretons in the camp: Senior Scout Justal, Ranger Menoit, and Commander Derre. Taking them out will give me enough time to return with reinforcements."
"3952276-1-4919";"Maybe, but they've taken over the whole town. If you decide to help, talk to Tamien Sellan. You can find him at the inn.\n\nJust don't do anything to call attention to yourself and the Red Rooks should let you wander around in peace."
"3952276-1-4920";"He got himself lost in the swamp. Again. He tried to show up the other recruits and recover General Gautier's lost dispatch.\n\nListen, I can't spare many soldiers. If you head out into the swamp, can you keep an eye out for Gorak?"
"3952276-1-4921";"The Orc that stands … er … sits … before you represents the future of the Lion Guard! I am Recruit Gorak, pride of New Orsinium!\n\nPlease untie me. We have work to do. We must recover the General's dispatch and return to Captain Vistra."

"3952276-1-4923";"The Wood Orc mercenaries have constructed a ritual altar just inside this cave, made of the bones they've unearthed.\n\nWe don't know the altar's purpose, but we would disable it, then pursue Oraneth within. Will you handle her brutes for us?"

"3952276-1-4925";"Tell these people I made no false promises! What I sold came from Belarata, yes, but not everything brims with magicka.\n\nTell them, and I will share the way—the secret way—into Belarata! You will tell them, yes?"
"3952276-1-4926";"Perhaps! There's an ancient device on the eastern cliffs, Aldmeri harbor defense. Should have stopped this bunch before they started. Not sure why it didn't.\n\nIf you can get it working again, we'll have a much easier time of it."
"3952276-1-4927";"My father's a mage. His signature spell is a spell of hiding that I know can protect the villagers. If you can reach our house and prepare the spell, I can rescue the villagers and meet you there.\n\nYou just need to convince Dame Clarique to free me."
"3952276-1-4928";"I'm imprisoned in a pocket plane of Oblivion. I think I can use the magic I still possess to collapse the plane and end the ritual.\n\nBut in case I fail, you need to burn the Bloodthorn's boats. Don't let any more zombies leave the village."
"3952276-1-4930";"He says his name's Tamien Sellan. We caught him trying to sneak past us into the village. Dame Clarique's convinced he's up to no good, but I'm not so sure.\n\nMaybe you could talk to him?"
"3952276-1-4933";"It's Shad Astula. The Academy of Magic. Only the most promising members of the Pact are invited to attend.\n\nOn your way, now—down to the docks and speak to the boatmaster. He'll take you back to Mournhold."
"3952276-1-4936";"Drowned or captured. Captain Lerisa's looking for them. You heard of Crafty Lerisa, right?\n\nAnyway, I'm through. No more sailing for me. You want to find the captain, just look for her monkey, Howler."
"3952276-1-4937";"No, she's not here. She needs to stay safe, hidden. Uses a spell to speak with us by projection.\n\nGo report in with the council. Present yourself and be known."
"3952276-1-4939";"These and a few others. I sent the rest with my first mate, Jalan, up that canyon to investigate the nearest wreck.\n\nI'm about to lead these lubbers to check out a second wreck. Anything we find will be more than we have now."
"3952276-1-4944";"We drew straws and I wound up on watch duty. When I saw Daedra seal the entrance, I found another way inside. To rescue my brother, you know? But now I'm trapped, too.\n\nThere's a lot of magical projection stuff in here. That's how I'm talking to you."
"3952276-1-4946";"I always have a plan! It requires you to get down there and talk some sense into them. I'll make sure the Daedra don't lock us in here again. Just find me if Raynor gives you any trouble.\n\nAnd be careful. Illusion magic can be tricky."
"3952276-1-4949";"Why, these mages have joined the game! Sides have been drawn and tasks assigned. First, they each must perform a small deed for their new masters.\n\nIf they survive that, then the fun begins—they can start killing each other."
"3952276-1-4951";"Certainly! I appreciate the help. I was going to send a squad for these citizens. Got a list here. \n\nMeet me at the manor house in the middle of town when you've mustered them out."
"3952276-1-4954";"Surely. Here's a list of the folk I was still to muster out. When you finish up, head back to the manor house. Check in with the Captain, Landare.\n\nI'll just gather my wits."
"3952276-1-4955";"Aye, that I did. \n\nAnd I swear on the blood of me crew, that spook will pay for this wicked trick."
"3952276-1-4958";"He wants to prove himself to his ancestors. He thinks there's some sort of treasure deep in the vaults. Sor wants so badly to be a Rilis. \n\nI just want him to be safe. Please, will you look after him?"
"3952276-1-4959";"What? You'd … you'd help me? Thank you!\n\nI used to be a mage. There's a soul totem on my body here. My soul is down in the playroom, just through that door. Banish Falarel and capture my soul. Then bring it back to me."
"3952276-1-4963";"Go to Dawnbreak and speak to Sinyon. Be my Eyes there and make sure it's safe. I can't have Estre disrupting the campaign, and Urcelmo is already pushing through to Firsthold for preparations. \n\nRazum-dar and I have much to discuss."
"3952276-1-4970";"Crazy, isn't it? He's mad as a Bosmer. Won't listen to a word I say.\n\nI'll make you a deal. Find Marq. Convince him to come back. I'll trade you some gold and we'll both walk away happy."
"3952276-1-4971";"Yes. Three of my friends are in there—probably still shackled and helpless.\n\nI think you're the only chance they've got."
"3952276-1-4977";"Indeed. I need their rutter. They're sneaking ships through our waters; with that rutter, we'll know their routes, and intercepting them will be a matter of procedure.\n\nThere is, however, a small army of bandits in there. Feel like lending a hand?"
"3952276-1-4978";"My husband—the twisted creature he became, cursed me. Broke my soul into three pieces, and sealed them in phylacteries.\n\nIf the phylacteries were broken, I would rest, but they're guarded by vile beasts."
"3952276-1-4979";"They took her over the hill, to their camp around the shipwreck. Shamal too. Maybe they're already dead!"
"3952276-1-4981";"Well, I hate violence. And I'm kinda forgetful. All I really want to do is make weapons, not hit things with them. But I promised Mother I'd try. Will you help me? I seem to have misplaced my sword."
"3952276-1-4983";"Up by the bridge. Didn't want to risk the skeletons. \n\nBet you can catch her if you get … off. My. Beach!"
"3952276-1-4987";"<<1>> headed to explore <<Ac:2>>. Once the wards broke, I sent <<3>> to fetch him. Neither returned.\n\nMages Guild protocol says I should remain in place until aid arrives. I'm hoping that's you."
"3952276-1-4988";"Would you, really? I'm not used to kindness from strangers. I'd welcome your help!\n\nI put my things in several hollow tree stumps, then I got all turned around. All of the stumps here look alike, and there are crocodiles everywhere!"
"3952276-1-4993";"Everything! I thought I was so clever, trading all my gold for a large ruby. So much easier to hide from thieves.\n\nIt's in one of the guar's bags and now it's gone. I beg you—find my guar and ruby, please!"
"3952276-1-4994";"The canonreeve's daughter. She's trying to organize an evacuation up the road. Go talk to her if you want to help, I'm getting out while I still can!"
"3952276-1-4996";"Oh, it's perfectly safe, I assure you. I just need someone to put on the amulet and then irritate a wamasu until it emits lightning.\n\nWould you convince <<1>> to continue our work? Or failing that, perhaps you can take his place."
"3952276-1-4997";"There's an ancient device on the eastern cliffs, Aldmeri harbor defense. If you can get it working again, we'll have a much easier time of it.\n\nMy Captain sent a runner to find out how to activate it. Hasn't come back."
"3952276-1-4998";"There was a portal. The Daedra used it. But it disappeared. Near as I can figure, the only way in now is to jump down into the water.\n\nIf you're brave enough to take the leap, look for Skordo. Big Orc fellow. He always knows what to do."
"3952276-1-5002";"Magical sickness. <<1>> handles all that. Me, I guard the gate.\n\nKnow anything about stopping curses? Head inside. Shaman said he needs another set of hands."
"3952276-1-5003";"She's tended the chief since he fell ill. You've shown you stand with the stronghold, and for that you'll remain welcome.\n\nBut if you wish to stop the poisoner, you'll need her approval or the others won't help."
"3952276-1-5004";"<<1>> said most attacks come from the north. There are some caves, an old mine, and a ruined Imperial tower in that direction. If you find <<2>>, do what you must to stop him.\n\nYou do so with my husband's authority. With my authority."
"3952276-1-5008";"If this description is accurate, the entrance lies somewhere in the Hall of Might. \n\nBut there's something else. Would you come with me?"
"3952276-1-5009";"""My love, I can stand it no longer. Though I rebuked you, my heart yearns for your touch. To utter such words aloud is sacrilege, so I put these words down in hope you find them.\n\n""Find my second page, and you will find the mate."""
"3952276-1-5012";"The slavers took most of the crew up the beach, but Salach, Lidenar, and Ozor are still there. Other captives too, but they're no concern of mine.\n\nI'm too waterlogged to fight, but if you'll free my men, I'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-5013";"You're a gust of wind on calm waters, friend. I warn you, though—this might not be be easy.\n\nThe slavers took the focusing crystals and my combustion oil and we'll need to get it all back before we can relight the fire."
"3952276-1-5015";"My workers. They're like family, the kind that doesn't know their way around a marsh. Not like you.\n\nHey, if you run across them, would you mind keeping them safe? Especially <<1>>, my cook. As long as she's all right, I'll be all right."
"3952276-1-5016";"Suppose it's a bit troubling.\n\nSay, would you happen to be headed into the ruins? I have this report to finish, but if you could check on <<1>>, it'd set my mind at ease."
"3952276-1-5017";"<<1>> can take care of himself, but the other workers? They're used to city walls and cobbled streets, not stranglers and quicksand.\n\nIf you're traveling through the marsh, could you make sure they're safe? I would appreciate it."
"3952276-1-5018";"What? No! They're dead. What I need is their journals.\n\nEach researcher kept notes on their finds. If I can get the journals to Elden Root, the expedition isn't a complete waste. But I won't risk going in there. Would be safer running off a cliff."
"3952276-1-5020";"Well … there are things people want which aren't illegal, not exactly, but which the Dominion dislikes.\n\nLook, the pirates took some goods used to produce such things. If I don't get the goods to my contact, we'll lose our business. You see?"
"3952276-1-5021";"Follow the path east until you find the central chamber marked by the large welkynd stone growths.\n\nYou'll find the door there."
"3952276-1-5023";"They're buried at all four ends of the island. On a bluff outside Vulkhel Guard, just outside of Tanzelwil, near Castle Rilis. And on a hill overlooking Phaer.\n\nMy children loved the water. Loved the sight of it."
"3952276-1-5025";"Thank you. I happen to know some of the nobles in town collect Dwemer parts as baubles. \n\nIf you could find me a ring, a gear, and a tube, I'd have Leggy jumping around good as new in no time."
"3952276-1-5026";"Talk to <<1>> or <<2>>. They've both got runners. Otherwise, you could talk to one of the foreigners. Who knows what they have?"
"3952276-1-5027";"These mer have been sentenced to death. Find them, and carry out the order. We have records of their last known location, that should help.\n\nReturn with proof of their demise, if you please."
"3952276-1-5033";"Challenging an army is suicide. But you're on your way to face Vox, so you already understand that.\n\nIf you take out some of the cultists along the way, that would help. Every enemy that falls tips the favor to our side."
"3952276-1-5034";"I want someone to take them out, I don't care who does it or how. But whoever does will be well rewarded."
"3952276-1-5035";"I'm afraid so. His wife, Rosalie, and their daughter, Ganise, are still up there searching.\n\nIf you have the time to spare, I know they could certainly use some help."
"3952276-1-5036";"Mister Nurin's wife is still up there, but she says she's calling off the search. She's giving up too soon, you see?\n\nYou need to go offer to help. Don't tell her you spoke with me, though. She dismissed me. Go on now. Go help."
"3952276-1-5037";"Both, but look for Brother Hakam first. \n\nWith the Scroll of Return, you can get Abbot Durak back here sooner, where I hope he'll be able to put out that big fire."
"3952276-1-5042";"The Speaker for the Mane! Showed up with a bunch of hard-charging Khajiit soldiers and gave a rousing speech. Even left his top warrior behind to defend us!\n\n<<1>> will put you to work, like she did for me. I'm watching for pirates!"
"3952276-1-5044";"Please! I can't spare any troops from town, so I hope you're willing to help.\n\nThorn Lodge is to the northwest. Bring back any valuables you find and I'll split the profits with you."
"3952276-1-5045";"Well, the keys are still on their bodies you see. Three merchants. All killed in the attack.\n\nIf you could grab those keys and get the items from the chests, I'll make sure the goods are taken care of. Please. Do it for the dead."
"3952276-1-5047";"Retrieve the totem, rescue my employees, and you will be rewarded. Try not to kill all the Goblins, we need a workforce to be profitable. Use this rotten food to distract them.\n\nOh, and if you see <<1>>, tell him to start looking for another job."
"3952276-1-5048";"Across the river. Some is in a house and the rest inside the old church. May Akatosh watch over you!"
"3952276-1-5052";"Indeed. Myself and these others were exiled for standing against Sir Croix, but we are too few at present to retake the keep. \n\nThere are other knights in the keep who are questioning Sir Croix. Could you go in and look for those who would join us?"
"3952276-1-5053";"A spy reported that they're in the graveyard to the east, under guard. Still eager to help?"

"3952276-1-5062";"They've erected Daedric stones at the estate. The Shadowed Path mages use the stones to summon powerful atronachs. These monsters have been waylaying travelers and even some of my soldiers.\n\nWill you destroy the stones?"
"3952276-1-5063";"An excellent suggestion. I believe this automaton can unseal the door, if it can be controlled. \n\nI have its control rod but two focusing crystals seem to be missing. They are nearby but the local creatures dissuade me from claiming them."
"3952276-1-5064";"Ha ha ha! An interesting proposal.\n\nLet's see if your bite is as fierce as your bark."
"3952276-1-5065";"I used to collect items from Ayleid ruins. Nothing valuable, just little bits of things. I was about to explore the ruins of Vahtacen when war broke out. I haven't been able to leave town since. Would you search Vahtacen for me?"
"3952276-1-5066";"I followed you around and collected hearts from the Dremora you killed. Easiest job I've had in weeks!\n\nDalen can make strong healing potions out of them. It's a wonder that something beneficial can come from these creatures."
"3952276-1-5068";"Yes. Speak with the Arch-Mage. He's meditating on the challenges ahead. I'm still somewhat … drained from my efforts, so he'll open the portal to the Shivering Isles for you."
"3952276-1-5069";"We're tired of sailing independently. We planned to hand over the treasure to the Thalmor so they could make us privateers.\n\nBut <<1>> led a mutiny, captured most of my crew, and kidnapped my wife. Once he has the treasure, he'll kill them all."
"3952276-1-5072";"That's the Five Finger Dance! The greatest party in all the worlds. But I tell you dearie, things have been so boring the last few years. Why don't we see what mischief we can get into? It'll be fun!"
"3952276-1-5073";"Maybe, but I prefer facts to speculation. I don't know who she is or why she is in a Goblin cave, but I'm not prepared to go in there alone.\n\nYou willing to help the investigation? I'm going to set up a signal fire outside."
"3952276-1-5079";"What I think doesn't matter. I'm just following orders, and right now those orders are to be ready.\n\nDame Falhut's really the one in charge out here. She's up at the castle's main gate."
"3952276-1-5080";"Of course. I wasn't born yesterday. Neither was Dame Falhut.\n\nShe's our commanding officer outside the wall. You should talk to her up at the castle's main gate."
"3952276-1-5081";"I was quartermaster on the Albatross until <<1>> led a mutiny. He and his traitors captured most of the crew while we explored <<Ac:2>> for a lost treasure.\n\nCaptain should be up by the cave. She can tell you more."
"3952276-1-5084";"Good question. We're all part of the Daggerfall Covenant, right? Maybe it was a false report.\n\nAll the same, you should go. Talk to Messenger Cordier when you get there. I asked him to announce your coming to Duke Nathaniel."
"3952276-1-5085";"Reinforcements are on the way, but the King's Arrow would be a boon to the defenders. Vigrod Wraithbane, leader of the Companions, directs the defense of Shor's Stone. He needs you."
"3952276-1-5087";"Oh, a simple ritual designed to keep this facility staffed with undead for hundreds of years.\n\nBut Imperial mages decided to meddle, and it cost us our lives. I can end it, but I haven't been able to find their skulls. Residual foci, of course."
"3952276-1-5088";"Of course not! Well, maybe. But then the Companions showed up. They fought the cult to a standstill. The man who leads them, Narir, is back at our camp.\n\nI came out here to find help, of course. Yes. Help like you!"
"3952276-1-5089";"Lucky, I guess.\n\nAnyway, you look a strong enough sort. Would you be willing to retrieve the shipment of goods from my wagon? Can't be too far from here. If you find them, meet me in Shor's Stone. There'll be some coin in it for you."
"3952276-1-5090";"Fancy yourself a sellsword, eh? Yngrel the Bloody, they call him. He's wanted from here to Markarth. If you can track him in the hills and put him down before he causes more harm, there'd be gold in it for you."
"3952276-1-5091";"Please! My mother believes he abandoned us, but I know my father better than that. \n\nAnything you can find out would help erase this uncertainty."

"3952276-1-5294";"Right in one. All the good things I've heard about you must be true, eh? Zadala will go and make her report to Cariel. Follow the river, find the herbs and the case. And meet me in Dune when you've found them."
"3952276-1-5296";"Well, if she hasn't realized we're onto her, we might be able to catch her by surprise. She might be down at the Thalmor residence right now.\n\nI assume Oromin will want to be there when you confront her. The three of you should go quickly though."

"3952276-1-5301";"What? I'm no traitor! My sister serves as a soldier in the Skald-King's army, for Kyne's sake! \n\nLook, I really want to be there for her wedding. If you let me free, I'll reward you for your trouble. Just find me in Jorunn's Stand when you can."
"3952276-1-5304";"The twins stand at the entrance of <<1>>. Please speak to them immediately."
"3952276-1-5305";"Really? When we tried to enter the camp, we were besieged by trolls! My trusty clerk Eginir volunteered to sneak in and find my logging chief, Jafelma. He hasn't returned and I'm worried about him.\n\nIf you could help, I'll pay you for your trouble."
"3952276-1-5306";"Then speak to Laganakh in the village. She might have learned more since I've been gone."
"3952276-1-5307";"As you've seen, the Captain's private army guards this island. I know my way around this place better than anyone, and if you'll help me grab two magical relics Blackheart's got, I'll help you secure the rest of his treasure."
"3952276-1-5308";"Those sacred stones help calm the dreugh. If the Dominion takes them ….\n\n<<1>> and his son Njorlund came to protect the bog. Please speak with Saervild; his camp's beside the main road. Maybe he'll have some advice."
"3952276-1-5309";"Here's a list of the victims' families. Find out what they know about their murdered kin.\n\nI'm almost glad the guard never got around to it. As my son says, mammoths can't dance."
"3952276-1-5310";"Nah. I've seen a few of the bootless louts skulking around, behind crates and such ….\n\nSomeone needs to go grab one of the guards and ask what in Oblivion's going on here. You up for it?"
"3952276-1-5311";"A doorway, maybe stairs, or a portal of some kind? I'd join you, but I'm no use in tight quarters.\n\nI'll inform the vicecanons of what happened, yes?"
"3952276-1-5312";"If I knew that, they wouldn't be missing, would they? They could be anywhere, they might even be dead. But if they're still alive, we could really use their help. Would you be willing to look around Bruma for them?"
"3952276-1-5313";"He's the Jarl's advisor. He has his hand in everything that happens around here.\n\nTell him what you told me. Leave nothing out. Vurlop's smart. If what you say is true, and by Kyne I hope it isn't, he'll know what to do—without causing a panic."
"3952276-1-5314";"""Damn the Renrijra, they've located the puzzle-stones! I saw one playing with a stone—they obviously don't know what they're for. If only we could overpower a pirate and retrieve a stone, its magic would lead us to the others!"""
"3952276-1-5315";"Actually, Lord Vurlop suggested that you two take care of it. I need to keep the Prince in line, and we don't want to tip our hand to the Stormfists.\n\nBesides, I know you can handle yourself. Get in there and secure the King."
"3952276-1-5321";"I never said it was complicated. Besides, by scaring off those Wood Orcs, you just might have improved your chances. The Wilderking sees these things, you know.\n\nAll right. Run along now. And may the forest part to reveal your path!"
"3952276-1-5322";"Well, you see … the husks are the same, grown from local flora. It's the guardian's guts that make it special.\n\nBring me some thunderbug bellies, dew bugs, and hive seeds from outside the village, and I'll show you how to make one."
"3952276-1-5323";"You are a hardened lot. Very well, I have a gamble in mind. We do what Rilis wants and disable the stones that bind his soul to this prison.\n\nHe will then enter this plane, where we can slay him. Though, he could do the same to us. Can I rely on you?"
"3952276-1-5326";"His father and sister joined me in the search, and told me of a woman named <<1>>. She works for Hadran himself. Might even know where my boy has gone … but would not speak to us. Please, will you try to speak to her?"
"3952276-1-5332";"Don't ask me. We're at a standstill as far as I'm concerned. I'm not even sure what's at stake—until I know more, we're hunkering down here.\n\nIndaenir's been running around though. He's probably got a plan, but you two are on your own for now."
"3952276-1-5333";"Molag Bal has trapped me within a pillar of darkness infused with his own vile energy and powered by the Light of Meridia. That, however, will be his undoing!\n\nThe Light of Meridia can also banish this darkness, but you have to bring it to me."
"3952276-1-5335";"<<1>> and I must rally the remnants of Stormhold's forces to <<A:2>>. If the skin-stealers took <<3>>, they'll know what he knew.\n\nRendezvous with our forces at <<A:2>>. We must learn what the Dominion plans for the <<A:4>>."
"3952276-1-5336";"The city's original name no longer matters. Now it is but the Hollow City. A perfect place to begin an assault on Molag Bal.\n\nThis city can be a tool, a weapon. Armor against the hazards of Coldharbour. It just needs life to fill it once more."
"3952276-1-5339";"Divided over the fate of our Hist tree. But tradition demands that you pass our trials and prove your worth before I reveal all of our secrets to you, outsider.\n\nPlease, head down this path to the city. I will follow you."
"3952276-1-5341";"The braziers atop the Xanmeers of First Light and Setting Sun? Light them as part of hatching ritual, and listen as you walk among the Dominion. See if they mean us harm.\n\nAlso, if she still lives, send <<1>> to me. I'll need her for the ritual."
"3952276-1-5342";"Long ago, before the Green Pact, the Standing Stones were used to protect the people from the aggression of the forest. \n\nIf we can activate the stones, it could prevent the trees from spreading the blight to anyone else."
"3952276-1-5346";"Go west, beyond the Moonless Walk. There, you shall find the Ayleid King held within a tower of darkness.\n\nVanus the Mage is somewhere in the eastern plane. His exact location is hidden from me."
"3952276-1-5350";"It's a reckless curiosity drives a person to look for cause in such things. Me, I'll take ignorance and a long, happy life in Marbruk or Woodhearth.\n\nBut if you got to know, you might talk to Breduin in his hut in town. He's staying, poor fool."
"3952276-1-5354";"Would you? With the mist returning to normal now, it might be easier to find her. That's what I hope, at least."
"3952276-1-5357";"Truly? Then we must find <<1>> and stop him from this madness.\n\nCrack open this camp. Pull any inklings of his methods like meat from the shell. I'll rally my soldiers and prepare to assault the ruins."
"3952276-1-5358";"It would ease my mind to know she's with the hero of <<1>>. \n\nThe Dominion camp atop this hill fell to the lamias. She went to scout the wreckage."
"3952276-1-5364";"Couldn't say. But the problem right now isn't the prince. It's the damn Blackroot clan—cruel in life and downright vicious in death. We can't get through them.\n\nIndaenir seems to have some ideas, though. You want to help, you should talk to him."
"3952276-1-5369";"I thought I heard one of them calling out, but the ocean twists up sounds. If they're wounded or pinned down ….\n\nCould you keep an eye out for my soldiers? They answer to <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Two of us can cover more ground."
"3952276-1-5370";"<<1>> has an old treaty with the Maormer. They claim the Dominion fleet intended to invade their home waters. It's a sticking point in the negotiations. <<2>> could use some help. Find him, give him this token. He'll know you are a friend."
"3952276-1-5372";"Two magical wards seal the temple, marked by emblems of a scorpion and a spider. If you can keep the undead away while I disrupt the wards, we can search for <<1>> together.\n\nHow about it?"
"3952276-1-5374";"Patience, Zur. I'll explain everything.\n\nI am with the Mages Guild. We stepped through the portal and wound up in this Vile Laboratory. Daedra experimented on us. They merged our two souls. Now we're wasting away as this soul-meld kills us."
"3952276-1-5376";"Soon, yes. First though, I must take proof of my find to the Temple in Satakalaam and ask the priests to ensure this is turned into a proper shrine.\n\nI wonder … would you consider taking word to her, telling Falisa I live, that I have succeeded?"
"3952276-1-5380";"Now that you ask, I have a sack of fertilizer here for Skulreid Foxbite of Cropsford. It's no ordinary fertilizer, however. It's so fragrant, it's like having a bag of roses on your shoulder.\n\nWould you finish the delivery for me?"
"3952276-1-5385";"An Ayleid ruin. We don't really know what it was for.\n\nCaptain Ethrel and Sergeant Galandir took scouts to investigate, but they were captured. The Daedra are holding them for some kind of ritual. We need to save them."
"3952276-1-5386";"That's it. Just ensure the letter reaches Octavimus and we'll all be happy."
"3952276-1-5387";"""Fadeel,\n\n""Huzal hungers! Many snakes may I tame, but no one tames him! The desert rumbles with his serpentine desires. He craves fresh meat. Send the unwary into Sandblown Mine. Huzal must feast.\n\n""Mirudda"""
"3952276-1-5389";"Just a small pouch of sand. Hisham is my old comrade. He will surely pay for the delivery.\n\nCropsford is far and far from here—southeast of Castle Alessia. Consider that, wayfarer."
"3952276-1-5390";"I was invited to survey some Dwemer ruins that Nervyna claimed she discovered within the mine.\n\nLooks like they dug up other things too, judging from these corpses. Will you help me find Nervyna? It doesn't seem safe to go alone."
"3952276-1-5391";"A magical barrier shields the entryway to the hall. It's powered by elemental crystals. We must destroy the crystals and collect a key to open the gate.\n\nYou must hurry. Daedric justice can be swift."
"3952276-1-5395";"I think I know. When our scouts found signs of Dominion soldiers to the west, <<1>> led a contingent of soldiers to an Ayleid ruin called <<2>>. Hurry there and tell her what you know.\n\nIf you'll excuse me, I have vermin to clear from <<A:3>>."
"3952276-1-5396";"This is a simple matter. The competition has three divisions—Summoner, Sorcerer, and Swordmaster. Speak with the champions of each division. They will instruct you further."
"3952276-1-5397";"That's what I want to hear!\n\nOkay, then. There are five rounds, each with a different combatant. The first three are qualifiers. Those take place in the Summoner Arena. The last two are in the main arena, if you make it that far. Got it?"
"3952276-1-5398";"Enter the Sorcerer Arena to duel in three qualifying rounds. \n\nIf by some bizarre stroke of luck you survive, you'll proceed to the finals, where you'll have to face me. I'll be happy to kill you just for being an insufferable know-it-all."
"3952276-1-5399";"Why, in the Swordmaster Arena, my lovely. Their blades cry out for your tender flesh. Defeat them, and you will have your chance at the Championship."
"3952276-1-5400";"Only this. There is a reason why it is so difficult to unseat a Grand Champion. \n\nBy tradition, it is the Grand Champion who sets the terms of the duel, and even after it begins, she is free to change these terms at her whim."
"3952276-1-5401";"Damn it. I'll work with Kazirra to contain the district. We need to keep the Arenthians out of there. You stop that ritual. Find Akkhuz-ri and do what needs to be done."
"3952276-1-5402";"Head to the safehouse in the market. It's the hut with the lion statue at the bottom of the steps. Oh, and stop to listen to the propaganda illusion playing in the market square. It'll give you a sense of what we're up against."
"3952276-1-5403";"The tower, yes, the tower. We will help you with that and so much more!\n\nBut all of our eggs must be returned."
"3952276-1-5404";"Grab some of the old uniforms in that tent. Free <<1>> and the other prisoners, and they can walk out in disguise. <<2>> already has buyers set up. He'll be out for blood. He comes after you, and you take him out. Simple."
"3952276-1-5406";"Yes. Traveling through Valenwood is a funny thing. It may take them many days to find the path to my throne.\n\nYou have all the time you need. Find the Spinner's Cottage and speak to Maruin. Safe journeys, my friend."
"3952276-1-5412";"Praise you! Praise you! I'm trying to gather all her things, but her tools are scattered out in the ruins, and those are her most important possessions.\n\nIf you'll get the tools for me, I just know she'll forgive me. I just know it."
"3952276-1-5415";"It'll be good for your health—a nice walk and you'll stop bothering me. Old Trelon will be happy for the news and will pay you well. I'm no longer welcome in Bruma, so the reward's all yours."
"3952276-1-5417";"""We spotted Aldmeri on the beaches. If you need me, send a runner up and around the hill above <<1>>. Double back to the dock near the entrance."""
"3952276-1-5419";"I wish I could go with you, but someone needs to stay back here and guard the gates.\n\nIf you two can fight your way through the tunnel and help get the Mane back here safely, you'll be heroes in my book."
"3952276-1-5420";"That she should be set to bury those we've lost. Community service to ensure this never happens again. \n\nYou've done so much for us already … but I need your help. Talk to the people of Greenhill, see what they say. Then help me decide."
"3952276-1-5422";"They're somewhere in the old merchant tunnels.\n\nBe careful though—the tunnels are crawling with undead and the damned Veiled Heritance. You'll need to watch each other's backs. I wouldn't try to fight my way through there alone."
"3952276-1-5423";"Our biggest problem is that some of our forces were cut off, surrounded in the old merchant tunnels. Making matters worse, Mane Akkhuz-ri was with them.\n\nWe need someone to fight their way into the tunnels and find a way to get the Mane to safety."
"3952276-1-5424";"Then perhaps you're strong enough to resist their call. If you find them and bring them to the shrine, you might finish what I could not.\n\nPlease, I beseech you! The books are a darkness that must be erased from the world."
"3952276-1-5429";"There's a cave directly beneath us. I called a spirit there to heal the Great Tree's roots, but it hasn't returned. Would you see what holds the spirit back, and aid it if you can?"
"3952276-1-5430";"More to the point, we would fight the dead they raise. Such is our sacred duty as Ash'abah.\n\nNone of that matters though, unless I can find the ingredients for the antidote. It is the only way to save my father. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-5432";"I suspect it was the necromancers—the Withered Hand—but it is of little importance now.\n\nAll that matters is finding the ingredients for the antidote. If my father dies, there is no Ash'abah for the king to call upon. Will you help me then?"
"3952276-1-5433";"A vast darkness blankets Elden Hollow. It is dark magic unleashed by the death of Canonreeve Oraneth, a rogue Thalmor politician.\n\nThe Hollow is unsafe to traverse, though Kargand, our leader, insists we explore it."
"3952276-1-5434";"We tracked them here, and several of the chapel guardians went in to retrieve the relics. But … they haven't come back. Would you be willing to venture into the ruin and see if you can find our stolen relics?"
"3952276-1-5439";"I don't know! All I've been able to decipher is the seals were created with blood magic.\n\nIf you kill the Maormer and infuse this blood rune with life energy, you might be able to repair the seals, but there's more to it. I-I need to keep reading."
"3952276-1-5442";"Some sort of nature spirit. It entered the cave where the Great Tree's roots emerge, but something's wrong.\n\nI heard horrible noises inside the cave. The spirit cried out, as if in pain. The Great Tree will die if the spirit can't do its work!"
"3952276-1-5443";"Oh, but please! My Brielus is a fine and noble man. He'll be delighted to hear this news.\n\nIf you go to Cheydinhal, please let him know I will wait for him in Vlastarus, forever if need be!"
"3952276-1-5444";"The fat-bastard ogrims dragged away my friends. We joined the Guild together. It ain't right, them getting tortured by ogrims.\n\nYou rescue Sinfray, Borgath, and Vikord. I'll locate Overseer Aruz. Then you and me can deal with him, all permanent like."
"3952276-1-5446";"He's selling secrets. Dominion secrets. His lovely little resort town is lousy with agents of the Ebonheart Pact and Daggerfall Covenant. \n\nI need to find proof, steal back what he's stolen, and take him out. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-5448";"Moon Hallowed. And right now it's just a suspicion between the two of us. We need you to go and find out. Head to the Moonlit Clearing, just north of Senalana. Speak to the priestess there and we'll know for sure."
"3952276-1-5450";"Very. According to Indaenir, Hectahame guards the Heart of Valenwood. He believes Naemon is corrupting it, and this corruption turns any soldiers we send forth … feral. \n\nIndaenir knows more. He waits for you at the gate."
"3952276-1-5452";"Hairy, squirmy, squeaky little rats! They've infested the plantation since the storm.\n\nThe inspectors will ask, if we can't protect our fields from those dung-dropping sugar-eaters, how can we protect them from skooma-brewing thieves?"
"3952276-1-5453";"No. Our ancestors are sacred. We cannot strike them down, even in such a … state.\n\nWe must know why this has happened before we do anything. I need to get word to King Fahara'jad immediately. Will you travel to Sentinel for me, wayfarer?"
"3952276-1-5455";"Father tried to save our alchemical tools. If they survived the fire, I could trade them for medicine.\n\nPlease, it's all I can do to keep my father alive. This one begs you to salvage the tools from our storehouses!"
"3952276-1-5457";"Would you go to Vlastarus and let Angiente know that Munya is dead? I don't dare show up without her. I'll bring her body as soon as I can, but if you'd get word to him, I'd really appreciate it."
"3952276-1-5461";"The Temple of the Dance at Rawl'kha is central to the March. It is a place of holy worship in the region, and one where the next steps can be taken. I cannot go. I must remain and see to my city. But I wish you bright moons and sharp claws."
"3952276-1-5463";"Do what you want. One of them asked what year it is. I didn't wait to find out if it was a Daedric trick or if I was just crazy.\n\nNone of them followed me outside, thankfully."
"3952276-1-5466";"Nothing other than the multitude of Dremora sitting on top of them! I could handle this myself, but I didn't want to demoralize the troops by making a spectacle of my awesome battle skills.\n\nBut, you, on the other hand. They're used to that from you."
"3952276-1-5469";"If you think you don't need training, speak with Grand Warlord Sorcalin. Only she can excuse you from it.\n\nGo to Fangil at the Western Elsweyr gate to start your training, or see Sorcalin to skip training. Your choice."
"3952276-1-5470";"Of course, walker. The range is here for that. Spend time with each weapon, firing at the targets we have set up.\n\nTalk to Firamo and Miniel, then return to me when you are done."
"3952276-1-5473";"How is this possible? If you are immune to their call, perhaps you could bring them to the shrine. You could finish what I did not!\n\nI know I ask much, but the books carry knowledge that is not for this world. They must be destroyed."
"3952276-1-5474";"Inside the story. \n\nI ask you to help me help her by joining her story. It can make all the difference."
"3952276-1-5477";"Absolutely! I need someone from the outside to help in this fight.\nI've had to send my own son, Prince Azah, to investigate, but he needs help.\n\nIf your offer is genuine, then go speak to General Thoda. He is at home, but we need his counsel."
"3952276-1-5479";"An Eye has opened on Arenthia, one of Queen Ayrenn's personal agents. Seek the Wood Elf known as Cariel by the road into the city. And I shall see you again at our appointed hour."
"3952276-1-5480";"Hunt him down, Hallowed. Cleanse the temple, restore the cool light of Jone and Jode. And, always, stand beside the candidates. Shazah and Khali are counting on you."
"3952276-1-5487";"Eager and confident. I like that! \n\nI need you to collect blood from the vampires. It's an integral component in the pacification ritual I will perform. Use the blood to mark their lairs. I'll meet you near the Heart when you're finished."
"3952276-1-5489";"Go to Vlastarus and look for the laziest person in town. That'll be Klovag. Tell him to get his carcass over here."
"3952276-1-5492";"It gets worse. Legend says that the Missing God is dead. That the Den … it is his body. The great emptiness of the Den is the decaying corpse of a dead god. I don't know … what's that?"
"3952276-1-5493";"I … I think they got Talania. I saw her stabbed. Decanus and Veranus, though. I think they might still be alive, somewhere deeper in the complex."
"3952276-1-5496";"It's your skin. If you think you're ready, speak with Grand Warlord Zimmeron. Only he can excuse you from training.\n\nGo to Mirrored-Skin at the Southern Morrowind gate to start training, or see Zimmeron to skip training. Either way, move along."
"3952276-1-5497";"You'd better; that's what they're here for.  Spend a few minutes using each weapon. Hit the practice dummies with them.\n\nTalk to Looks-Forward and Lirtis if you want more information. See me when you're done."
"3952276-1-5499";"Confident, aren't we? If you think you don't need training, speak with Grand Warlord Dortene. Only she can excuse you from it.\n\nGo see either Zahreh or Dortene, your choice."
"3952276-1-5500";"Why else are we here? We set up perfectly good siege engines that you recruits ruin. Makes me want to bash in some heads.\n\nTry out each weapon; hit the target dummies with them. Don't break anything and see me when you're done."
"3952276-1-5502";"My wife's remains were sent here, unjustly. She was a good woman. I have to come to see her remains consecrated, but it has proven difficult.\n\nI wonder if you could assist me. If so, come to the gates of the burial grounds, and I will explain."
"3952276-1-5504";"Praise you! Praise you! I'm trying to gather all her things, but her tools are scattered out in the ruins, and those are her most important possessions.\n\nIf you'll get the tools for me, I just know she'll forgive me. I just know it."
"3952276-1-5509";"Decanus, Veranus, and Eliana. They … took Eliana to a room on this floor. Don't know where the others … are."
"3952276-1-5511";"They didn't stop to answer questions, just told me to be on my way. \n\nYou look pretty capable. Why don't you go up to the camp and figure it out for yourself?"
"3952276-1-5512";"Word of our efforts spread to a group called the Dawnmead bandits. Scum, they peddle skooma and steal from villages in the south. They attacked Nethrin, and this one fears all our efforts will be for nothing. She hates to ask, but … will you help?"
"3952276-1-5513";"I wouldn't use those words, but yes. I assure you that the Guild will amply reward you.\n\nYou'll accompany Apprentice Patraud while he treats with the Bosmer. Just let him do the talking, and we will join you shortly."
"3952276-1-5514";"A powerful object with the ability to suppress magic. Dangerous, were it to fall into the wrong hands. Luckily, we already possess it.\n\nGo to Marbruk in eastern Greenshade. Speak to Captain Sarandil about securing the staff. I'll follow soon after."
"3952276-1-5515";"But how? Are you strong enough to resist their call? Could you bring them to the shrine, and finish what I did not?\n\nHeed my words. The forbidden knowledge within those books isn't for this world. They must be destroyed!"
"3952276-1-5516";"<<1>> runs the plantation with her father. She didn't have much to tell me.\n\nMaybe she'll be forthcoming with someone who isn't a Thalmor inspector. If this was arson, I'll need to know."
"3952276-1-5518";"""Wouldn't have found the path to the treasure were it not for the tome.""\n\n""He must have left it. Wants me to find the treasure. I won't disappoint him. I left the tome in the cellar to remind me of my task."""
"3952276-1-5519";"In doing so, you would have the gratitude of this Spinner. With my fate goes the memory of the village."
"3952276-1-5522";"We charge into their encampment, rescue the hostages, and slaughter their commanders. This fool scout we captured gave us their locations.\n\nYou and Razum-dar shall spearhead our attack—one of you to handle the hostages, the other on the commanders."
"3952276-1-5523";"I thought I heard one of them call for help, but I couldn't tell from where.\n\nIf you're headed along the beach, would you help me look for my squad? Their names are <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>."
"3952276-1-5524";"We are simple people here, and we know little of magic. As part of the contract, Alanya offered herself as our pact-hostage. I want to give Master Pircalmo more time to work his magic, but he has little time left."
"3952276-1-5525";"I'd say you should go talk to Treethane Ranneth. She runs our little town here. She has the biggest house in town, the one with two bulbs. Can't miss it. Have a good day, traveler!"
"3952276-1-5529";"I'll send anyone I can spare, but the city comes first.\n\nThere is an outpost at the sanctuary with a few soldiers … if it hasn't been overrun. Go through the Serpent's Grotto and look for Major Cirenwe. She's the commanding officer."
"3952276-1-5532";"""The Daedra have been polite so far, if not a little lascivious. Still, I'm not sure that I can fully trust them.\n\nThey hold me within a tower. I will continue to write these notes and drop them from my window until I am rescued.\n\n-Stibbons"""
"3952276-1-5534";"Smash up some of these weak-willed swabs and bring me a new set of bones. \n\nWhen I get back on me feet again I'll reward you handsome-like, with loot and all. What do you say, mate?"
"3952276-1-5535";"Preserving his life may be impossible at this point, but you must try. Without him, the Valenwood will rage out of control. \n\nThe only hope lies with Aranias, and with you. Go to Greenheart and follow the trail of fire to the Wilderking's throne."
"3952276-1-5538";"The workers ran and just left them on the ships! \n\nThe Covenant's Pride, Ranser's Regret, the Belle of Balfiera—the designs just sitting on the decks! A Dominion spy could steal them! For the sake of the Covenant, will you help me get them?"
"3952276-1-5541";"A thousand apologies. My tongue doesn't know its proper place. Yes, our knowledge can be shared by all who desire proper training.\n\nPerhaps you would take the rites of Leki's Blade? Please speak to my esteemed teacher, <<1>>. She's within."
"3952276-1-5542";"So many have said before you. But before you hold a sword at this school, you must learn the most important lesson. The one of history.\n\nSpeak to <<1>> and answer his riddles. You'll find him working the forge. After he is satisfied, we shall talk."
"3952276-1-5550";"We want you to get in there and open the Labyrinth before we send in the entire force and reveal our numbers.\n\nHahnin and Gabrielle can brief you on the battle plans for the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild strike teams that will follow after you."
"3952276-1-5551";"Yes,  My acolyte Hadam-do will greet you outside the temple. I'll see you there, Moon Hallowed. May the Bright Moons light your path."
"3952276-1-5552";"The Mane has fallen and so a new Mane must be chosen. The Moon Hallowed is the one to make that choice. But don't ask me about this. Go to the Moonlit Clearing, north of Senalana. The lunar clergy can answer your questions."
"3952276-1-5553";"It means you may be the one to walk beside the next Mane. This is a harrowing path and one not lightly taken. Go to the Moonlit Clearing, just north of Senalana. Speak to Priestess Kauzanabi-jo there and she will tell you truly."
"3952276-1-5554";"It is a narrow, well-defended span of rock swarming with Daedra and dominated by a gatehouse that blocks the way into Molag Bal's personal domain.\n\n<<1>> knows the region. He's a strange fellow, but I trust him. He's waiting for you at the Chasm."
"3952276-1-5555";"Ha! I'm glad I have one of us fooled. The Imperial curs actually have one up on us. They're holding hostages and the king doesn't want their blood on his hands.\n\nI need someone … unofficial … to go in and free the hostages. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-5556";"No! You'll help <<1>>. The boss suspended hostilities for the wedding. No one will attack you.\n\nAnd if you take the job, tell that matchmaker to call me in. This is no work for a certified cutthroat. Go on. Through the tunnel and up the hill."
"3952276-1-5557";"Oh, and Scholar Zhoreh wants her apprentice Shiri to return to Bergama right away.\n\nShe wants you to speak to Captain Rawan and ask him to order Shiri to return, whether the girl wants to or not."
"3952276-1-5559";"It means you may be the one chosen by the bright moons to walk beside the next Mane. This is a harrowing path and one not lightly taken. But your role is not for this one to decide. Please, will you pray at the altar? Allow the moons to speak?"
"3952276-1-5562";"Not my concern. I get paid for feathers regardless.\n\nGo talk to some of the townsfolk if you're that curious. The magistrate's the one who runs this town. Tell him I've got some more feathers coming his way!"
"3952276-1-5563";"A league of like-minded adventurers. Every one of us eager for riches and glory. Sound like anyone you know? \n\nSo what do you say? Think you can be one of the Undaunted?"
"3952276-1-5566";"There are wounded in the market. If you want to help, send them this way. We need to clear them out before we launch our counterattack."

"3952276-1-5569";"Absolutely not. This entire tribe was enslaved by Dark Elves. They have more reason to hate the Ebonheart Pact than you or I.\n\nBut someone in <<1>> decides to set an example, and now there are barricades. It's why I need outside help."
"3952276-1-5570";"Pariel … broke our pact with Y'ffre. She called upon Hircine, Master of the Hunt. He changed her. Now, by Y'ffre's command, I must end her before she hurts others.\n\nShe fled into these caves. She knows my scent. I can't get close."
"3952276-1-5572";"Yes! Pieces of me are all over the place. It's rather disconcerting!\n\nI'm probably not the first skeleton you've had to reassemble, and I doubt I'll be the last. But once I'm walking again, we can figure out what the Wormies want with <<Ac:1>>. Deal?"
"3952276-1-5574";"Find a way inside and locate the Fighters Guild.\n\nWards protect the hall, making it impossible for anyone to get in or out of the building. We know a secret tunnel that leads into the hall, but we'll be trapped inside until the wards are deactivated."
"3952276-1-5575";"I have to finish writing, and get those relics back. There's no way I can do both in the condition I'm in. Can you track down the relics for me while I finish my work? I've done all the research, I just have to get it written down."
"3952276-1-5576";"No need to concern yourself. I'm sure I have this well in hand. I imagine I've already destroyed the Great Shackle and even now we're celebrating our victory over the Lord of Brutality.\n\nYes, I'm sure that's what has happened."
"3952276-1-5577";"Maritus Blasio of Vlastarus, Divyth Dorvayn of Bruma, Enide Geta of Chorrol, Varana Scaeva of Cropsford. List grows longer every year.\n\nKeepsakes to remember them by."
"3952276-1-5578";"That is … generous of you. \n\nWe're being attacked on three fronts, and I need my archers here just to keep the Daedra from breaking through. If you could stop them from pushing the north and south fronts, we might have a chance."
"3952276-1-5582";"Heh. It's stupid. I snagged my foot on a root and tripped. While the others were slaughtered, I was face down in the mud.\n\nI know I should avenge them, but I'm a coward. Please, help me. Destroy that … thing."
"3952276-1-5583";"I believe so, but I thought it best not to speak about it through other parties. Once again, I need you to be my eyes and ears. Razum-dar here waits only for you to leave. He'll meet you in Skywatch, and together you will speak on my behalf."
"3952276-1-5587";"<<1>>. Said she was <<2>>'s betrothed. She went in after him, and that's the last person I've let in since.\n\nThat is, unless you see fit to go in after them?"
"3952276-1-5588";"Do just that. The Dominion can't afford mercy for traitors. Justice must be served, and swiftly. \n\nHe cannot be far from here. There's a reward out for his head. Find him before I do, and there'll be coin in it for you."
"3952276-1-5589";"More than that. Ask anyone, if they're willing to talk. Ask <<1>>, hiding in the town hall where it's safe.\n\nI smell the fear. Mine. Theirs. Ask about the harpies. And the Gold Coast. Mercenaries. There's no gold and no coast, just mercenaries! Hah!"
"3952276-1-5590";"Long after the body's wounds have closed, hardened into scars, the mind's wounds still pierce. Still sear.\n\nBut I know that gleam in your eye. Like me, you can't help but desire the pale senche's ivory hide."
"3952276-1-5592";"No, it's no use. The guards are in league with the brigands. Paid off. \n\nPlease, no one else will help me."
"3952276-1-5594";"Ah yes, I have her flute from our courtship. We used it to meet secretly in the woods. When you play it, you hear the music from its twin.\n\nI tried to use it to find her, but I just got lost. I'm not cut out for traipsing around the woods."
"3952276-1-5595";"They captured Halalin, Fanrel, Nielas … and the others. Took them away to torture and who knows what else?\n\nOh, Divines, what if they're dead? I should've fought. I should've cut their throats. I ran. Why did I run?"
"3952276-1-5599";"My kidn— no, ha, Laurosse couldn't kidnap a puppy that followed him home because he had a bone in his pocket.\n\nHe's my betrothed. He's … an Altmer. Yeah, it wasn't a popular match. But he's not like the other Altmer. Divines, I miss him."
"3952276-1-5600";"The Artisan targets local Altmer, so I draw suspicion. We must capture the Artisan before the Queen is targeted.\n\nTake my notes."
"3952276-1-5601";"Only certain kinds of people profit from war. Manthir has benefited particularly, even as we are spread thin. In such times, we often employ outsiders. Collect the payment from Manthir and a cut of it is yours. Simple, yes?"
"3952276-1-5602";"Angore was supposed to sell me a shipment of Summerset silk, but he pulled a switch. Left me with nothing but a crateful of rags and a dumb look on my face.\n\nBring me the silk out of the Sea Hawk's hold. You'll be paid when I see the goods."
"3952276-1-5603";"Just down there in the ravine. It looks like the Argonians have set up a camp there. I followed them this far, but with this wound I'm useless in a fight. Will you help us?"
"3952276-1-5604";"I can read it, but I am afraid to. \n\nI am not like the other Hollow. I can question my existence. I can believe or not believe.\n\nWhat if the book reveals something about the Hollow? Our purpose. I might crack and splinter from within."
"3952276-1-5607";"I simply placed the goods in different houses. When I send these letters detailing the locations, mutual hatred will drive the Altmer out."
"3952276-1-5608";"Yes! I have! What does that have to do with anything? Look, these strangers … they had an evil look about them. And whatever they were carrying, it gave off waves of … of evil! \n\nPlease, you have to help poor Gonlas! I saw them go into his house!"
"3952276-1-5609";"To the north of the city lies the ruin known as Ondil. If you please, investigate the ruin and bring back any interesting books you can find."
"3952276-1-5610";"West of here, on the coast near Ash Mountain, lies a Dwemer ruin, the <<1>>.\n\nIf you please, investigate the ruin and bring back any interesting books you can find."
"3952276-1-5612";"Smugglers and skooma-peddlers called <<m:1>>. <<2>> saw her son captured by bandits and brought to <<3>>. This one tried to free him, but was driven away.\n\nPerhaps you will have better luck?"
"3952276-1-5614";"Head north, and you'll find the road to the city. I'll run ahead and let my superior know you're coming. Wouldn't want you to surprise her. Luck follow you on the road."

"3952276-1-5630";"Thalara's recipe requires Red Mountain Ash. The mountain's eruption spewed ash as clumps of tuff, yes? If you gather it for Thalara, the reward would be great. Search the shores of Lake Rumare for the tuff."
"3952276-1-5631";"Well, you get me some Red Mountain Ash and I'll whip up a batch and maybe give you a bottle.\n\nHead down to Lake Rumare and look for Red Mountain Tuffs along the shore. You can harvest the ash from those. Bring it here and I'll get right to work."
"3952276-1-5632";"It would be the simplest of tasks for one such as yourself. Tuffs of Red Mountain Ash crowd the delightful shores of Lake Rumare.\n\nGather ash for me, and the blessings of Akatosh will rain down upon your head!"
"3952276-1-5635";"He was last seen heading into these tunnels. The whole thing is a sordid affair. The poor bastard must be mad with grief. You'd have to be to stay down here.\n\nWe could use some help, if you're willing—there's a lot of ground to cover."
"3952276-1-5636";"""I made it past the front door, but stealth was never really my strong suit. I didn't expect the place to be crawling with skeletons! I'm going to hide until they settle down. I should be fine if the damned scuttler doesn't give me away.""\n\n—<<1>>"

"3952276-1-5639";"That would only make matters worse. This is clearly a punishment visited on us for something we did wrong.\n\nTreethane Rolon inside the cave is trying to set things right. You should talk to him."
"3952276-1-5640";"Treethane Rolon sent me to look for outside help. I don't know what he intends.\n\nHe said something about a horrible crime—I think he thinks the forest is trying to exact justice for something. He's in the sacred cave with the others."

"3952276-1-5644";"If the vipers are here in numbers strong enough to assault Khenarthi, all of the southern seas are in danger. The Queen is in Auridon right now, beginning a royal visit. Raz would ask you to head to Vulkhel Guard and report to <<1>>."
"3952276-1-5646";"We have conflicting reports on that concern, but Razum-dar is investigating.\n\nRegardless, your first priority is to inform the queen of our victory and this unfortunate news about her brother. Give her this letter. It contains all the details."
"3952276-1-5647";"As we speak, two of my guardians investigate rumored anchor sites. Merric and Aelif are the best the guild has to offer. Meet up with them on the beach east of Vulkhel Guard. You can proceed from there."
"3952276-1-5649";"These are the Vaults of Madness, constructed by the Mad Architect. It's an eternal prison for his enemies. For me.\n\nI cannot leave until I am whole—a Harvester has taken my soul. Find it, defeat it, and we'll leave together."
"3952276-1-5651";"Well, as it turns out, we're fresh out of parts. Rat parts, I mean. \n\nI need you to bring us the head, legs, body, and tail from four different rats, so we can combine them into an animated rodent assemblage!"
"3952276-1-5653";"Treethane Ranneth oversees everything that goes on here in town. She's in the big two-bulb house right here in town. Can't miss it! You have a good day, friend!"
"3952276-1-5654";"I'm not actually sure! If you listen to Ragalvir, he thinks there's some problem. I'll put my trust in Treethane Ranneth, though. She knows what she's doing.\n\nShe's the one you should ask if you have any questions. She lives in the big double-bulb."
"3952276-1-5656";"We're at war. We can't have Pact sympathizers plotting in the shadow of <<1>>.\n\nLook, <<2>> wants outside help to ""resolve the Argonian issue."" You can find her by the main entrance."
"3952276-1-5657";"Not for me to say. <<1>> can tell you what she needs. Stay vigilant, citizen."
"3952276-1-5658";"Crouch low and look for traces of its passing. Mammoths aren't the most graceful creatures. Look for tracks, broken branches and the like. \n\nTrack it, kill it, and bring me its tusk as proof."
"3952276-1-5659";"It won't be easy. But you look like you can handle yourself. \n\nDo you know how to track? Crouch low to the ground and look carefully. You'll see signs of the troll's passing. Track it and kill it, and bring me its arm as proof."
"3952276-1-5660";"Would you? I'd really appreciate it.\n\nTo track the wasp, crouch low to the ground and look carefully. You can spot where the wasp has landed—just look for matted grass or broken bushes. Track it, kill it, and bring me its head."
"3952276-1-5667";"We turn no one away from trying, but it's no easy task. Staunch warriors and adept mages alike have faltered in the quest—you must become a fearsome hunter, willing to give your life to protect Brackenleaf.\n\nOur leader, Glaras, can tell you more."
"3952276-1-5680";"I do. The workers have rest camps in between the johads. If someone brought in this poison, there may be evidence of it there.\n\nIf you can find something of import, bring it to me. I'll be at the main johad down the road."
"3952276-1-5681";"You mean … you would go and get the Tear of Anurraame for me?\n\nYes. Of course. If you'll go get the Tear and bring it back to Magister Wulfdis in Shornhelm, that would show the old bastard. I think I could even claim credit."
"3952276-1-5684";"Sounds crazy, but I know what I saw.\n\nI overheard the villagers talking about a caretaker, and a tree. Maybe you could find this tree and discover what they want? I hope they're not invaders. It's much too freakish for my blood."
"3952276-1-5688";"I'm a tree. But I think. I feel. How? Other trees have no such faculties, do they?\n\nI even have memories. Movement. Walking. A cave … but then nothing. There's something about the cave. It's near. Will you search inside for the answers I have lost?"
"3952276-1-5689";"I don't know! They poured out of the ground. The soldiers rushed me back to camp, and now I'm the only one remaining.\n\n<<1>> won't let me venture from the camp, but you have no such restriction. Please, find my acolytes! Some must still live!"

"3952276-1-5766";"All right. Well, if you ever come back to this neck of the woods, we'll kill you.\n\nI'm only joking! Wyress humor again. Go on now. May Hircine bless your hunt, wherever it may lead you."
"3952276-1-5773";"Travel to <<1>> and look for <<2>>. I've heard she's a reliable captain with a fast ship. She can bring you to the port of <<3>>, which is just south of <<4>>.\n\nAnd if she gives you trouble, tell her I sent you."
"3952276-1-5775";"My friend <<1>> was staked out to die. Free her, then meet me near the eastern mine entrance.\n\nI would accompany you myself, but they broke my fingers when they tortured me, I cannot hold my sword."
"3952276-1-5776";"Take this concoction Elgenie made. ""It heals and conceals"" according to her. If they're injured, they'll need it, but it only lasts so long.\n\nThey must come here straight away or risk the effects wearing off."
"3952276-1-5777";"Pah! If the knights appreciated the Baandari, they'd fatten this one's purse!\n\nCrazy Eye doesn't like to work for free! Do you? Or maybe since you're not Baandari, they'll pay you! If you want to help, see the Knight Commander Cheryline."
"3952276-1-5778";"Go to the docks within Murcien's Hamlet. Look for <<1>>. If he's still alive, he'll be in charge now.\n\nWhatever you can do for him, you do for us all."
"3952276-1-5779";"We could use it. Report to <<1>> on the docks. We're taking orders from him for now."
"3952276-1-5783";"Sure did. Bastard bribed the city guard, attacked the other nobles, and seized half of Shornhelm.\n\nNow Montclair's troops are all over, and the Shornhelm Guard's getting its buttocks kicked. So? Want to help me save the kingdom?"
"3952276-1-5784";"Then I suggest you join him. Knowing Verandis, he's returned to Ravenwatch Castle to study whatever evidence he may have found. You'll find it west of the city, near the town of Crestshade. I'm counting on the two of you to stop Reezal-Jul, and soon."
"3952276-1-5785";"Do not question me! If my orders aren't followed to the letter, Montclair will defeat us and Rivenspire will be lost!\n\nTalk to Countess Tamrith and Baron Dorell. Tell them what I have said. Then meet me at the bridge that leads to the Doomcrag."
"3952276-1-5792";"It's up there a ways, outside the royal crypt. One of the prince's knights stayed there to protect him. She can be noble if she wants, but I'd rather be alive. I do feel bad though. That's why I was thinking maybe if I could find someone to help her?"
"3952276-1-5796";"Julianos's truth! Such ignorance is breathtaking.\n\nIf you'll help me find out what has happened to <<1>>, I will tell you all about the ruins. If he's dead, I would want to take back the wages I'd paid him, at the very least."
"3952276-1-5797";"I won't turn down the offer, if that's what you're asking.\n\nOne of <<1>>'s citizens offered to help me find the scouts, but she seemed a bit … eccentric. Perhaps she has something to offer beyond alarming theories."
"3952276-1-5798";"Yes. Sometimes victory means getting dirty, and that's quite literally true here.\n\nA passage in the sewers leads to the gatehouse. If you'll open the main gate, we can get into the garrison without having to scale the walls and lose half our men."
"3952276-1-5800";"The Prince of Schemes, the Harvester of Souls. Do not force me to speak his name.  \n\nOne of his Dark Anchors has planted itself in the ruins of what was once the town Gil-Var-Delle. Those who came to destroy it have gone missing. We must find them."
"3952276-1-5802";"The beasts are feral with hunger. We're going to use it against them. Lure them into a trap.\n\nBefore we get started, you really ought to meet the team. That is, if you're still interested."
"3952276-1-5803";"Why indeed! Rahannal, the thrice-damned traitor, that's why! He wants to overthrow this place now that he's freed himself. \n\nI saw him lurking by the mine entrance to the east. Free me and we will free this place, with or without him!"
"3952276-1-5805";"Really! That's so kind. Puddles loves day-old fish. You can probably get some at the docks. I hear <<1>> catches more than he can sell. And he has a soft spot for adorable creatures.\n\nAnd take it from me. Nothing is more adorable than my Puddles!"
"3952276-1-5808";"The Blacksap Rebellion, for one. Though nearly broken at the Dominion's formation, its last remnants plague <<1>>.\n\nWith your help we can finally end our civil war. If you're agreeable, I'll open a portal to our base of operations."
"3952276-1-5809";"We're going to kill as many of them as we can, until they overtake us or we've wiped them out. \n\nYou look like you can hold your own in a fight. We can always use more help, if you're interested."
"3952276-1-5813";"Three knights of Arkay obey my commands. I sent them out to the locations described in our order's scrolls, but none have returned.\n\nWould you try to find them and bring back the holy relics?"
"3952276-1-5815";"Until the next disaster befalls us.\n\nMarien … she lost her necklace. A family heirloom. You look capable. I have to stay with her, get her to Shornhelm. Would you go after these bandits? Try to find her necklace?"
"3952276-1-5816";"""If I succeed in my endeavor, I will find and return Urenenya's remains to the Silaseli ruins. If Klathzgar's ancient machines claim my life, it is my hope another will come behind me and take up this sacred quest.\n\n""Pelorrah, Scholar of Cloudrest"""
"3952276-1-5817";"Ask her! I didn't stick around to hear her explanations.\n\nThough ""excuses"" would be a better word. Everything is somebody else's fault. Hmph!"
"3952276-1-5818";"Kill the killer. Adusa would rather do the work herself, but this codebook demands immediate attention.\n\nFind the assassin where he waits, west of town. When the deed is done, find me at Ravenwatch Manor. Bright Moons guide you!"
"3952276-1-5819";"Do you actually listen to what Adusa says? Yes. Get the list.\n\nThis one learned that Rasaba the Keen carries the list. Kill Rasaba, or do not, Five-Claw. As you choose. We only need the list."
"3952276-1-5821";"Thanks to the codebook you found, yes.\n\nRohlbert is hiding inside the old Montclair Manor in Shornhelm's upper city. We'll meet in front of the manor house. Then we finish this. One way or another."
"3952276-1-5823";"Quite so. At least he should be, once I reverse the transmogrification.\n\nBut all in good time! I'll need you to find where Stibbons put my alchemy supplies, and perform his other duties while he's absent. Best get started!"
"3952276-1-5824";"That's the thing! No one even knows him. Gavendien—that's his name. He and his bailiff sauntered into town last week, and now he's constable? Something smells wrong. \n\nSay, think you could poke around and try to find out what's really going on?"
"3952276-1-5827";"He's there, or he's dead. If you'd be willing to take on the vampires, take my dog whistle. Xandier's been trained to come straight to anyone that blows it. He's a smart dog … smarter than my husband, sometimes. Xandier will find him for you."
"3952276-1-5829";"I saw a few soldiers by the windmill. They must be setting up defenses just outside the city.\n\nFind their captain, and do what you can to help him."
"3952276-1-5830";"Well, as you can see, they did not like that. They say I know too much, that I cannot just float away down the river. \n\nThey will soon kill me … unless a kind soul like yourself would release me. Then I can go and put down new roots in Shornhelm."
"3952276-1-5832";"Exactly. So I have to choose. Countess Tamrith or Baron Dorell. Frankly, since you've recently fought alongside the two of them, I would appreciate your counsel.\n\nSpeak to them if you wish, think about it, and then give me your recommendation."
"3952276-1-5833";"Talk to <<1>>. He'll tell you what needs to be done."
"3952276-1-5834";"Unless the bears' spirits power the wards, we can't enter our own temple. Without the wards, the bears are wild, and we can't reach the altar to ask Hircine why he abandoned us. \n\nCan you kill the bears and free their spirits?"
"3952276-1-5837";"And then there's the personal matter—that damn guillotine. \n\nFor reasons you might recall, I want it demolished. I've given the order to Captain Ernele, but on your way out of Wayrest, I would ask that you ensure it's being done thoroughly."
"3952276-1-5839";"Someone was probably, no, definitely drunk.\n\nLook, I didn't think he was really going to do it! I must have passed out because when I woke up he was gone. He's my best friend. You've got to help him."
"3952276-1-5840";"Good question. You wish to serve the Camoran throne? You can start by asking <<1>> why his people aren't fulfilling their promises. He's the one who seems to have the entire Elden Tree lodged up his flue.\n\nI can say that. I'm the king."
"3952276-1-5841";"Truly? Here, this letter outlines our grievances. If you would bring it to the king, we would be in your debt.\n\nUnless you wish to help pull termites from our ""embassy."""
"3952276-1-5842";"I just heard pirates attacked <<1>>! I need to head back and see if they ransacked my home.\n\nIf you're here to petition the king, would you bring him my letter? I wasn't boasting, I did fight by his side. My seal will let you bypass the line."
"3952276-1-5843";"It gets worse. Legend says that the Missing God is dead. That the Den … it is his body. The great emptiness of the Den is the decaying corpse of a dead god. I don't know if … what's that?"
"3952276-1-5844";"""Final Entry: I finally won the confidence of the troll patriarch, Grimtooth. My work here is done. I wish you could have been here, Gothurg, but I'll see you soon in Shornhelm. I'm going to give Grimtooth a hug goodbye and then I'm on my way."""
"3952276-1-5845";"Adusa would sniff him out. But for you, something more subtle. Start at the west gate. Find the courier named Guitaut. Follow him. Watch him.\n\nHe will try to pass a message. Watch and see who comes to find it."
"3952276-1-5846";"I think Firaelion hoped to gather their silk to make the dress. Foolish Elf.\n\nThere are stories about a spider the size of a bear and twice as fierce that makes its home there. Oh gods, if something happened to him …."
"3952276-1-5848";"Necromancers. Their kind has not been seen in the Alik'r desert for years, but that only makes them more dangerous.\n\nIf you can go to Sentinel and just ensure all is well, it would be a relief. I have made travel arrangements, if you are willing."
"3952276-1-5849";"The treethane wants his bow back. And if I can't give it to him, he's going to have me hauled in and whipped. \n\nLast I heard, <<1>> was headed toward <<2>>. The treethane won't let me leave town. Could you look for <<1>>?"
"3952276-1-5850";"Doing so would make <<1>> look weak. No, we must proceed.\n\nYou've proven your competence, so I'll ask you to speak with <<2>>. He's an expert on <<c:3>> and knows what must be done. Quite pleasant, once you grow accustomed to the smell."
"3952276-1-5852";"<As you examine the area, you notice a journal scrap next to the dead Orc nearby. It looks like part of a journal.>"
"3952276-1-5854";"You would venture up to Jackdaw Cove? Uela's influence has corrupted everything there. It's wretched, but if you are willing, I will not try to dissuade you.\n\nSearch for my sisters near Jackdaw Cove. Perhaps with your help, Uela can be destroyed."
"3952276-1-5855";"Nothing as yet. I found the ruin crawling with Worm Cultists. I'm just an old man, more at home in books than battle, so there was no way I could reach the Ayleid Well on my own.\n\nStill, I hoped they'd have cleared out by now."
"3952276-1-5856";"""Been with the Bitterhand a few days, but I've already earned more gold than I've seen in three months. Sent most of it back to sister … I wish it didn't have to be this way. However I end up in the ground, I go knowing I took care of my family."""
"3952276-1-5857";"""The darkness grows within me. I have been chosen for a sacred duty. I just wish … my dear Kala. My dear sister. I wish I could see you again in sweet S'ren-ja. I know I can hold this thing here, in the depths. But I shall miss you."""
"3952276-1-5858";"""I pray someone slays me soon. To the one who does and reads this journal, I thank you … I have one last request. Take these words and the amulet I place in these pages to <<1>> in Shornhelm. It will break her heart but she deserves to know."""
"3952276-1-5859";"No idea. He went to scout around and hasn't come back yet. Maybe you could go find him.\n\nWe did learn that they're using soldiers to keep people away from Northpoint. Only the officers seem to know what's going on inside, though."
"3952276-1-5860";"Bah! Are you trying to coddle me now too? I command you—put aside your concerns.\n\nThis isn't even going to be a real contest. Each of my soldiers can take ten of theirs, and you can take a hundred. So … can we get on with this?"
"3952276-1-5861";"You think it's just an elaborate suicide plot? Afraid I don't share your optimism. But what is she doing in there? I'd say ""only the gods know"", but I don't think they do. \n\nThe way I look at it, there's only one way to find out."
"3952276-1-5862";"Not infected. Chosen. But we can't talk about this here. Too public.\n\nHere, take the scent from my glove. Embrace your new gift and follow the scent to our packmaster, Songamdir. He'll teach you the ways of the hunt, the ways of the pack."
"3952276-1-5864";"If there's a portal—and I'll eat my armor if there isn't—we need to seal it before reinforcements arrive. \n\nA lone scout will have an easier time than a full force. We don't have the numbers to face them head-on anyway."
"3952276-1-5865";"If you wish to reject it, a wretched priest of Arkay will gladly take your coin to do so.\n\nOtherwise, listen to the blood that pulses through you. Let it guide you to Rahaja. She will show you the way to Mother Lamae's embrace."
"3952276-1-5866";"Caves are often homes to such spiders. If you release me, it will likely feel the webs twitch, and present itself to you. \n\nFree me, then please help me locate <<1>>. He should not be left alone for very long."
"3952276-1-5867";"<The crumpled wanted poster is barely legible through smeared blood. It calls for the head of the Orc Sgolag, last spotted near Mobar Mine. He is wanted for theft, murder, and abduction. A reward is offered by <<1>> in <<2>>.>"
"3952276-1-5869";"It's your neck, I guess. Burroot Mine isn't far—just at the bottom of the waterfall. \n\nBut my campsite was deep inside the mine, near the bottom, where the kwama nests were. That's where I left the notes."
"3952276-1-5870";"We've no time to request help from our troops in <<1>>, and the soldiers will die unless someone saves them.\n\nThe spiders trussed their victims up and dragged them deeper into the ruins. We'll pay you for your help."
"3952276-1-5871";"Oh, stranger, you are kind beyond measure. \n\nI called upon Adeena's twin sister, Izzara, two days ago. She's a powerful mage, you see? I thought she'd deal with the monster and be back by sundown. But she still has not returned."
"3952276-1-5872";"The Daedra cast some kind of ward on the door. A clever but futile gesture.\n\nThe barrier is powered by an Ayleid spell key. A simple relic, easily dealt with. Unfortunately it's being protected by several focus stones. Destroy them so we can get in."
"3952276-1-5877";"Go into the camp and find Captain Janeve. I saw Countess Tamrith and Darien head in there, too\n\nYou need to warn her. Let her know that Reezal-Jul is still out there. He's going to be drawn to the refugees like a wild boar to mud."
"3952276-1-5878";"We need to sneak in slowly, one at a time. Wandering around as a group would just be inviting trouble.\n\nThe tunnel is supposed to lead through the lighthouse. We need to get inside and find a place we can use to get the lay of the land."
"3952276-1-5880";"Within Brackenleaf's Forest. Just outside of <<1>>, bordered by the Long Coast.\n\nOur leader's name is <<2>>. If you choose to seek her out, do yourself a favor. Be respectful, and she'll do the same for you."
"3952276-1-5881";"Each day I carry a vessel of the waters blessed in this shrine and feed it into that which flows into the darkened vale. Its strength will remind the earth what it once was. But my body grows weak with age even if my resolve holds.\n\nWill you help me?"
"3952276-1-5882";"None of us know the area well enough to resolve these matters. Now we're a carnival with nothing but a fortune-teller. Huzzah.\n\nI'd gladly pay the coin provided by the Summerset Cultural Expansion Council to anyone who would help us put on the show."
"3952276-1-5883";"It's been a year since the Grahtwood civil war ended. And the Blacksap Rebellion still operates in a city called Cormount north east of here.\n\nWith your help, the Vinedusk can end the rebellion. If you agree, I'll open a portal to a secure location."
"3952276-1-5884";"Grand! If you could, pick up the shipment and bring it back to me.\n\nI'd go myself, but <<1>> and I … well, we're not on the best of terms. A misunderstanding, but hazardous to my health. Tell her you're there for ""Treeshade Imports."""
"3952276-1-5885";"It could be were I able to get my hands on the other fragments. Without them, this piece is useless. Still, the fact that the fisherman found it on the shore could be valuable information. Perhaps there are more ruins somewhere off the coast."
"3952276-1-5887";"We're tracking a spy. Naruk. He worked for King Fahara'jad until he turned on the Covenant. Now he's inciting war.\n\nKaleen left to meet Sigil, a contact with info on Naruk. They were to meet outside town, off the road. She hasn't come back."
"3952276-1-5889";"One grain of sand at a time, my friend. It's true we don't have the troops to go traipsing off into the desert, but one person can scout Hallin's Stand and see if Septima's there.\n\nIf only I had a loyal and capable friend here …."
"3952276-1-5890";"My editor gave me a list of other scholars who have gone missing here, presumably to frighten me!\n\nAminyas and Dechery are their names, and I want you to search for their camps and see if they had research I can … cite."
"3952276-1-5891";"<The fragment is etched with runic symbols you cannot decipher. It appears to be part of a larger tablet.>"
"3952276-1-5892";"Because the fools' password is a combination of letters from the Raiders' names and professions—totally forgotten now.\n\nAll four Raiders are buried here, but their gravestones are worn. I found a few clues. I have coin if you can figure this out."
"3952276-1-5893";"By Mauloch, yes. I could use a partner on this one. Like I said, the pickup's out in the Silaseli Ruins.\n\nMeet me out there and we'll make some coin together."
"3952276-1-5894";"You're not gonna believe it, but I got here, and this stupid mage … well, you better just see for yourself. Follow me."
"3952276-1-5895";"Imperial invaders perhaps, giant chains dropping from the sky—or maybe she just got spooked by a crow. Not sure. Anyway, she ran straight through those Daedra, and this one isn't going after that one.\n\nWill you help get her to safety?"
"3952276-1-5896";"Could be anything. Last time this happened, she fled from Wayrest because she thought the rain was dissolving her hide.\n\nJust find her and figure out what she needs. What do you say, walker? Can you do that for me?"
"3952276-1-5898";"""Saw <<1>> in <<2>> today—she's the Barkbite chief's third wife. I dropped hints she's in charge because of me, but nothing stuck. She doesn't have a foul bone in her body! Felt wrong to push her, so I wished her a good day. Must be getting soft."""
"3952276-1-5900";"We've had our fill of this whole damned campaign. <<1>>. <<2>>. Now this sand pit. I'll take my troops and go. It's simple as that. We'll head back to Cyrodiil to fight the real war. You have my word.\n\nWill you help or not?"
"3952276-1-5901";"Doesn't matter now, does it? The Imperials got in, and the border post is lost.\n\nI have a dying request. Bring me the helm of <<1>> so I can rally others to our banner. We can salvage some honor at least …."
"3952276-1-5904";"Excellent. I'll organize our forces and march to Bangkorai Pass within the hour. \n\nI've already sent scouts to assess the Imperials' defenses. If you get there before me, look for Scout Nadira. We can finalize our plans when we're all there."
"3952276-1-5905";"I've a list. Nothing big or heavy. These are refugees, and the Imperials took things of personal value. Heirlooms and such.\n\nThey're camped near <<1>>. These poor unfortunates asked me to find someone who can get their items back. Can you?"
"3952276-1-5906";"Because the city is doomed. Even if they are not destroyed by the Reachmen, there is a corruption from within the city that will bring it down.\n\nI prefer that my cousin Phylgaux was not there. Please, just tell her she has to get out."
"3952276-1-5907";"The group was led by Sir Dubroc, and they went to Jackdaw Cove, hoping to strike at the heart of these Reachmen, this Hagraven who apparently leads them.\n\nIf you do go north, we wouldn't complain if you looked for Sir Dubroc. He may need help."
"3952276-1-5908";"Sure, that sounds like a great idea! If you want to try. <<1>> talks to the little people in the biggest house in town. Just let no one say Semusa did not warn you."
"3952276-1-5911";"No. We should not interfere until we know more, but if you are willing, I would ask that you carry word of this development to Commander Ahla at Bangkorai Garrison. \n\nShe will know best what should be done."
"3952276-1-5914";"Priestess of Azura. Molag Bal's been torturing her longer than you, me, maybe even these trees have been alive—and he's not like to stop unless someone makes him.\n\nOld <<1>> tried. Haven't seen her since."
"3952276-1-5916";"A league of like-minded adventurers. Every one of us eager for riches and glory. Sound like anyone you know? \n\nSo what do you say? Think you can be one of the Undaunted?"
"3952276-1-5919";"Touch Meridia's light and see the world through the eyes of your former enemies.\n\nBut fair warning—you will no longer be seen as a great champion. Even familiar faces will see you as a soulless drifter, lost in an unfamiliar land. What say you?"
"3952276-1-5922";"I had hoped you would make such an offer. My instincts tell me that Reezal-Jul allowed the refugees to survive. It's a trap. It has to be.\n\nFind the camp and tell the Captain what I have learned. Then help her end this threat once and for all."
"3952276-1-5923";"We are! Thrill-seeking adventurers, every one. We aren't mercenaries like the Fighters Guild, or patriots like the Dominion. We fight to prove we're the toughest of the litter.\n\nYou want in? You'll have to prove yourself."
"3952276-1-5926";"Well, you've experienced two of the three alliances. Care to finish the set? Fill out your map? Collect all the … metaphors?\n\nIf you're game, just touch Meridia's light and you'll be off again!"
"3952276-1-5933";"<A crude map of the area shows the location of <<1>>.>"
"3952276-1-5936";"I don't know the details.\n\nLook, <<1>> can tell you herself. Me? I'm done with that operation."
"3952276-1-5938";"I don't know. If the dead here are rising and this is the royal crypt, have any of my ancestors risen? Maybe they can give us some answers.\n\nWould you consider venturing into the royal crypt to find out?"
"3952276-1-5942";"Maybe it's nothing. There have always been stories about the barrow. It's just that … well, lately it seems a little more real. Like something or someone disturbed the dead inside. My brother is a capable fighter, but I still worry about him."
"3952276-1-5944";"The hengekeeper would know better than I. She is nearby, in the roots below.\n\nSeek her out. Banish whatever darkness shadows this grove."
"3952276-1-5945";"Necromancy is foul enough, but it's something more he's after. He's experimenting on the living, too. I was likely next in line. I don't know what his goal is and I don't care. You have to stop him before he kills more innocents."
"3952276-1-5948";"They've been out there for hours. I don't know what's taking them so long. Could you look for them? I'd go myself, but I've got to keep watch over the village. I'd be very grateful … and so would my gold pouch."
"3952276-1-5950";"My wife is the mayor of Crestshade. She's stubborn, but devoted to her job. She refused to leave while the town was still in danger. \n\nCould you go to Crestshade and make sure she's all right?"
"3952276-1-5954";"I need someone to fight their way into the barrows and find his hiding place.\n\nIt shouldn't be too hard. One of Althen's old cronies came to help him escape. Trolls got to him, but he must've been carrying a clue to Althen's hiding place."
"3952276-1-5955";"If I had to guess, yes. I just don't know what's taking them so long. They've been out there for hours.\n\nCould you help out your old friends, go look for them? I'd go myself but I've got to keep watch here."
"3952276-1-5958";"I am sworn to remain here. I shall meet <<1>>, who is on her way with a contingent of soldiers. But you are not so bound.\n\nGo to <<Ac:2>>. Find <<3>>, if he still draws breath. Help him protect our future."
"3952276-1-5960";"Certainly. I have one prospect who should be simple—Martin Dathieu. He's in the stocks for Mara's sake, but I can get him released if he enlists.\n\nWhen I spoke to him, however, he was stubborn and rude. Perhaps you could talk to him?"
"3952276-1-5963";"I don't know. I tried to tell him that no girl can resist a man with a few scars, but that didn't seem to sway him. Unfortunately, I lost my patience after that and now he won't even come near me.\n\nIf anyone can convince him, though, it's you."
"3952276-1-5964";"Each knight went to a different place rumored to contain a relic. I came here, Matthiaume went to Flyleaf Catacombs, Edweg to Sanguine Barrows. \n\nDo you think you can try to find them?  We were to meet Alvaren at Hoarfrost Downs."
"3952276-1-5965";"I advise caution, my friend. Our enemy has been one step ahead of us the entire time.\n\nI'm certain that, unlike me, Montclair had no trouble with his memory. Who knows what we may find in the ruins below?"
"3952276-1-5966";"Captain Skordo leads the mission. I trust Skordo implicity, but with your help our chances of success increase a thousandfold.\n\nHead into the farmlands surrounding Northpoint and find Skordo and his team."
"3952276-1-5968";"The Lorkrata text contains maps of the ruins, among other things. These maps reveal two portal chambers higher up the mountain.\n\nIf you can reach the first chamber and open a portal, we can begin moving troops into position."
"3952276-1-5969";"If it was up to me, no. But our numbers are low and we can't be picky. Besides, I'd rather risk the life of a bandit in battle than some poor girl who's never even swung a sword.\n\nIf you're willing to speak to Shuga, she's over by the ironworks."
"3952276-1-5970";"I know where to find one of these stones—a great mundus stone dedicated to the Celestial Warrior.\n\nBut it's locked deep in the ruins of Kardala. Only a Skystone amulet, the kind worn by ancient Nedic priests, can open the way."
"3952276-1-5971";"Gwendis reported that Northpoint has been sealed. I fear Montclair already controls the city.\n\nFind Baron Dorell. He commands the troops amassing outside the city. I'm sure he has a plan in motion. Talk to the Baron and see what you can do to help."
"3952276-1-5972";"No, I don't. Arlie's parents have owned this estate since before I was born. We were to be wed here but a month from now. I know that Rivenspire has bigger problems right now, but … this is my future. Will you help me look for them?"
"3952276-1-5976";"If you have a mount of your own, you are welcome to join the race.\n\nWould you like to take part?"
"3952276-1-5979";"I'll find my way. Verandis taught me well. And Adusa's back at the manor. She'll keep me company. Things will be all right. It'll just take time.\n\nNow go. Get out of here and go help the High King choose a ruler for Rivenspire."
"3952276-1-5983";"Yes. The Reachmen's Matron, <<1>>, is near. I've heard she will meet a Covenant spy. <<2>>. They both must die, but I can't fight today. My sword arm broke in an earlier raid, curse them!\n\nCan you kill them? I have some gold."
"3952276-1-5985";"One of our order, Hara, is leading our efforts to stop these attacks. But we're not warriors. \n\nThis cart will take you to Belkarth, in Craglorn, where you can speak to her personally. Please, help us."
"3952276-1-5986";"Yes. I worry that the Worm Cult may have been meddling in Hakra's tomb, and if that's the case, Lieutenant Slonn isn't the only one in danger.\n\nIf you would go to Pinepeak and make sure all is well, it would be a favor to me and to the king."
"3952276-1-5987";"Yes. If the Worm Cult has broken into Valdur's tomb, it would be good if you were there anyhow.\n\nHopefully, this is not the case and Narir has simply been delayed. We cannot risk waiting too long."
"3952276-1-5988";"Yes. The faster the better. Fly like the wind and seek out the king himself. You will find Honrich Tower to the southeast.\n\nKeep your teeth sharp, friend, and may your gods be with you."
"3952276-1-5989";"You didn't notice the hordes of Reachmen surrounding the town?\n\nWe will sing about the battle of Shor's Stone for generations to come. Take part in their saga!  <<1>>  will welcome you, I guarantee."
"3952276-1-5990";"They've got a portal in there! Leads straight back to Covenant lands. Won't be long before they can launch an attack on the city. \n\nGet in there and find it. Damned thing is maintained by two crystals. Destroy them and it'll pop like a soap bubble."
"3952276-1-5991";"Only dead ones. It's strange. The little bastards normally have their bugs on a short leash. Something's happened to them. I … probably shouldn't go back in there. Will you look around inside? Find what I couldn't?"
"3952276-1-5992";"How do you think? I'm a respected trader with the Darkvale Trading Coster. One of the largest importers and exporters in the southern isles. Get those potions back and I'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-5993";"I was sent by an egg-sister, Walks-in-Ash. She wanted me to examine the wards and report back. Will you get a message to her?\n\nIf you're willing, head to Fort Virak. North of here. They should be able to get word of the instability to her."
"3952276-1-5994";"The Daggerfall Covenant. Troops have surrounded the city. If you want to help, find General Holgunn. He can use another blade, I'm sure. Davon's Watch is on the northeastern shore of Stonefalls."
"3952276-1-5996";"Aye. It's on the coast of Stonefalls. It's our top priority right now.\n\nWe can keep Fort Virak stable for now. But if you want to help us, see what they need at Vivec's Antlers."
"3952276-1-5997";"Your help? No, no. That's not necessary at this time. We've got it under control … for now.\n\nBut if you're really looking for something, go to Ash Mountain. The generals need help to prepare it for some ritual or another."
"3952276-1-5998";"He's a good friend, but he never shuts up. Nothing ""Still"" about him. He was supposed to meet me here, but I've waited too long already.\n\nIf you're heading north of Ash Mountain can you keep an eye out for him? He should have a camp up there."
"3952276-1-5999";"The Mace of Doormouse someone or another! It belongs to my wife. She'll kill me if I lost it!\n\nCan you find the mace? Maybe the Hagraven has it. I think I remember seeing her head toward our lighthouse. I need to sit here until the spinning stops."
"3952276-1-6002";"""There is no hope. Please do not make me dig your grave too.\n\n—<<1>>"""
"3952276-1-6003";"That would be a big help. We have small detail of Clan Murtag soldiers stationed near the at-Tura estate, and they've been waiting to hear something for weeks.\n\nIf you could deliver this dispatch, that would really take a load off my back."
"3952276-1-6004";"If you're willing to face a few more of these blood-suckers, I wouldn't turn you away.\n\nWe've tracked the vampires to three different locations. Can you deal with this problem for me?"
"3952276-1-6005";"I know it's not exactly proper, but I've always felt a connection to Azura. My father was a Spirit Warden. \n\nThe real problem is that I can't leave my post. I wonder—is there any way you'd take this to Brother Doumant at Pariah Abbey?"
"3952276-1-6009";"That's as good a term as any. Civil war. It's like mad King Ranser all over again.\n\nLook. Montclair's dangerous and the Countess needs all the help she can get. If you could join her in the chapel at Shornhelm, that would be a start."
"3952276-1-6010";"You were able to drive off Reezal-Jul and rescue Shornhelm. No small feat, I assure you. But Emeric still needs our help to restore Rivenspire's tranquility.\n\nWalk with me and I will explain. There is much I need to show you and time grows short."
"3952276-1-6012";"That half his army is freezing its legs off while Montclair tears his city a new portcullis!\n\nBetter yet, just help him get Northpoint back. I saw what you did in Shornhelm. We could really use a little of that approach right now."
"3952276-1-6013";"Ha! And will you want an introduction, as well?\n\nLook, if you really want in, talk to Commander Yjarnn. He decides who comes and goes."
"3952276-1-6014";"Something about Her Majesty's speech, I assume. Normally I'd be happy to head south. But visitors stream through the Skywatch gates. And the guard needs my help here. \n\nWould you take on this task? See this message delivered?"
"3952276-1-6016";"The woman Aranias and her companion Andur, the one who burns everything in his path. \n\nI am not sure which is more dangerous, but they must both be stopped if the Wilderking is to be saved. Cross the bridge and follow the trail of fire. Go quickly."
"3952276-1-6018";"In all the confusion, I'm embarrassed to admit that I lost track of my brother, Dethisam. He's the town consul. Yesterday, he went to check on the townsfolk afflicted by the plague, but he's disappeared.\n\nCan you help me find my brother?"
"3952276-1-6019";"Oh, you know. Unity under the Eagle banner and such. Why don't you head down there? Find a guard to report into. They're taking names at the gates, you know. Security.\n\nAnyway, head down there. You might see history firsthand!"
"3952276-1-6020";"That's what you will find out when you speak to him. Though, I admit I'm not sure exactly where he is at this very minute.\n\nHazazi's paws itch to race into combat! Warriors are not meant to stand around like glorified signposts!"
"3952276-1-6021";"We do not know. The Battlereeve sent a soldier, Hazazi, to negotiate with the Bramblebreach clan, but he has made no progress.\n\nNow Raz needs to hunt for the Staff of Magnus. So he asks you. Will you find Hazazi and sort this out?"
"3952276-1-6027";"Yes! We're no strangers to battle, but these Hollow … they're unstoppable. Strike one down and another comes forth.\n\nPlease. If you are as able as you look, Indanas still fights to drive them back. She needs help … and fast!"
"3952276-1-6030";"Do you always skip ahead in the story? No one has an iota of patience anymore.\n\nBut yes, I need a few bottles of the curative. I'm sure you'll be able to find some inside the quarantine. Then we'll see what's in this ""proprietary"" formula."
"3952276-1-6033";"Talk to Nilyne. Let her know I asked you to assist her.\n\nShe can be a little aloof, but she'll tell you what she needs you to do."
"3952276-1-6034";"Talk to Nilyne. Let her know I asked you to assist her.\n\nShe can be a little aloof, but she'll tell you what she needs you to do."
"3952276-1-6035";"Aside from playing host to the Skald-King and every Pact diplomat within a crow's flight of Skyrim? Ask <<1>>. He seems to think it's very important.\n\nGood luck finding lodging, though. With so many petitioners, the inn's turning people away."
"3952276-1-6036";"Call me Titus. It's a long story, but I'm familiar with Tarish-Zi and his army of Anka-Ra.\n\nCenturies ago, they were part of the Ra Gada, the Yokudan invasion force that subdued and conquered Craglorn. But Tarish-Zi and his army were among the worst."
"3952276-1-6040";"The Wilderking, of course.  \n\nIt matters not that you understand. It matters only that you go to Bramblebreach and ask how you might be of assistance."
"3952276-1-6053";"""To be a child of the Blood Matron is to forsake the Divines. If you are ready to join us, step through the portal. Otherwise, return to your city and speak to a cursed Priest of Arkay. The Blood Matron will not induct the unworthy or weak."""
"3952276-1-6054";"If you lack the soul of a true hunter, return to the city and speak to a Priest of Arkay. The Master of Beasts will not tolerate cowards or fools.\n\nOtherwise, enter the portal to Hircine's realm and follow the great hunter Songmadir to join us."
"3952276-1-6055";"The temple door can be opened by activating beams in the surrounding ruins.\n\nWe need to find the source of the beams and activate them to open the door. But we must be careful, as powerful Anka-Ra surely guard these locations."
"3952276-1-6056";"With Astanya's death we're … well, we're a bit disorganized. Please, you handled the Captain so well. \n\nGo to Silsailen, northeast of Vulkhel Guard. Find the Canonreeve or his daughter Elenwen, and help those people."
"3952276-1-6058";"The Canonreeve's daughter, Elenwen, organized an evacuation. Last I saw, she was heading for the barn on the west side of town. Go quickly, please!"
"3952276-1-6059";"I don't know. ""Nereid's Smile,"" they're called. So blue, so beautiful. There must be some nearby, but I'm too old to hunt them down.\n\nI wonder though … if you see any, could you gather some seeds? I could sow them here … for old time's sake."
"3952276-1-6060";"All I know is that anyone who drinks the water gets strong—really strong—and then attacks anything that moves.\n\nOur leader, Sali'ma, is inside, looking for a way to end the curse and save our researchers. If you want to help, talk to him."
"3952276-1-6062";"A league of like-minded adventurers. Every one of us eager for riches and glory. Sound like anyone you know? \n\nSo what do you say? Think you can be one of the Undaunted?"
"3952276-1-6064";"Please, go find Telenger in our camp. He's always looking for new people to boss around. You look capable. Maybe you can figure out what's going on here, where our people have gone."
"3952276-1-6065";"She's on a ship down in the cove. You have to find her before they execute her!\n\nWhen you've got her, get her up to the lighthouse. That's where you'll find the remainder of my squad."
"3952276-1-6066";"We are! Thrill-seeking adventurers, every one. We aren't mercenaries like the Fighters Guild, or patriots like the Dominion. We fight to prove we're the toughest of the litter.\n\nYou want in? You'll have to prove yourself."
"3952276-1-6067";"A researcher. Very bright, but often too absorbed in his work, if you ask me. Still, I like to help him when I can. Right now, he's on the trail of … oh, it's better if you just ask him about it. \n\nI'd just get it all wrong."
"3952276-1-6069";"The initiates of Rahni'Za prove their mastery by completing five increasingly arduous tests of strength and skill. \n\nI do not know how he did it, but the betrayer overcame the trials and killed Master Timen."
"3952276-1-6071";"A league of like-minded adventurers. Every one of us eager for riches and glory. Sound like anyone you know? \n\nSo what do you say? Think you can be one of the Undaunted?"
"3952276-1-6076";"Something awakened in the Citadel—or took residence. We Undaunted decided to find out what, and I still mean to. Whatever it is, it's fierce. Undaunted don't just disappear.\n\nI welcome such a foe!"
"3952276-1-6077";"It's a local flower. It grows in the shadow of the runestones those witches are tending.\n\nGather some and bring it to Fresgil. She'll take it from there."
"3952276-1-6078";"You should make haste to Driladan Pass. I am certain they will be grateful for your assistance. Look for Scout Catannie just outside the city gates. She's helping to coordinate our defenses.\n\nI'll remain here in case the queen needs anything."
"3952276-1-6079";"I know, I'm just … confounded, that's all.\n\nLook, I need more werewolf blood. Lots of it. You shouldn't have any trouble finding some. Goodness knows there's plenty for everyone out there."
"3952276-1-6081";"Stormhaven. Ruins. Near the border. They took him there."
"3952276-1-6090";"Battlereeve Urcelmo was already on his way to the city. He will know what is happening. \n\nHead to Firsthold, seek the Battlereeve. Raz will be right behind you."
"3952276-1-6091";"The Champions are not alone, though few of the Fort's defenders remain. Seek the Wood Elf known as Englor. He stands at the gate to the watch, hoping for salvation.\n\nThis one will see you again, at our appointed time."
"3952276-1-6092";"The Temple of the Dance at Rawl'kha is central to the March. It is a place of holy worship, and one where the next steps can be taken. \n\nKhali and I will meet you at the temple. Go well, Hallowed."
"3952276-1-6093";"Of course! Jone and Jode speak to you as well—you just cannot hear them.\n\nGo north, to the Fort. Find the strange little Wood Elf named Englor and heed his words."

"3952276-1-6103";"Please visit the throne of the king at the heart of sun-drenched Sentinel. Your audience would do him well in this time of great need."
"3952276-1-6106";"Yes. It is really just a formality. Very few even know the Staff of Magnus is in the city, but the queen wants to make sure the guard is doing its job.\n\nGo to Marbruk and seek our Captain Sarandil. He will be expecting you."
"3952276-1-6107";"In the belly of a Dragon? Lost in some hollow? You never know with the Undaunted. We had agreed to meet here, at this tower in Craglorn, but we are easily distracted. Brave and adventurous, but easily distracted.\n\nMaybe Brulo found a tavern."
"3952276-1-6108";"My brother Gendyn oversees the forge at Artisans Craftworks. It's the largest smithy in Mournhold! He promised me he'd take care of my order personally, but something must have gone wrong.\n\nCould you deliver this letter to my brother in Mournhold?"
"3952276-1-6109";"That would certainly help. At the very least, we need to know whether the Redguards really mean to attack.\n\nDon't go straight to Sir Hughes though. Look for Dame Falhut at the castle's main gate. Get the lay of the land. They may need your help."
"3952276-1-6110";"You should still head over to the Eastern Elsweyr gate. To skip training, you need to talk to Grand Warlord Sorcalin over there."
"3952276-1-6111";"Something about the Red Rooks and the Bloodthorns. The Provost can tell you more, if you're really that interested.\n\nNow get out of here before you bring the entire bandit gang down on my head."
"3952276-1-6112";"Well, if Wuuthrad was really shattered, we need to search for the shards, but we also need to find a way to stop the Worms.\n\nMy master is Elfriede. She wants you to seek her out at Honrich Tower to the west. The Worm Cult's leader is near there."
"3952276-1-6113";"If you are not the storm-tossed leaf I assumed, still you should travel to the Northern Morrowind gate. Speak with Grand Warlord Zimmeron there; he can excuse you from training."
"3952276-1-6114";"The scroll on this altar says something about it. I think you have to use the prayer wheel by the door.\n\nOnce you open the way, I'll show you where the others went. I can't help much, but I'll do what I can."
"3952276-1-6115";"You are the best judge of that. Even so, the Southern High Rock gate should be your destination. Once there, speak with Grand Warlord Dortene if you wish to bypass training."
"3952276-1-6116";"Sarvith, our Master of Incunabula, hopes to evoke a vision that shows us the events surrounding Faolchu's first death. \n\nWe're collecting historic artifacts to use as focus objects, but the spirits are making our task difficult."
"3952276-1-6117";"I don't know. Some kind of spell? I'm no mage, just a butcher with a shop in the market square.\n\nMinerva Lauzon's the only mage in the city that isn't madder than an Elf on Hist sap. She's in the sewerworks, helping the survivors escape."
"3952276-1-6119";"We need to find a way inside. To the core. But getting in will require an unprecedented amount of magical energy."
"3952276-1-6127";"Oh, right. She's upstairs in her study—those two men, Kelmen and Titus, are with her.\n\nI guess she wanted to meet in private. But she said it was very important that you be there."
"3952276-1-6128";"That's what I need you to learn.\n\nA conjurer named Kelmen Locke was present when the atronachs were first summoned. When they turned, his fellow summoners were killed. He was the only one to escape, and I fear he is in grave danger."
"3952276-1-6130";"You may call me Nhalan. I was a priest of the cult of the stars in this city when it came under attack by Yokudans from across the sea.\n\nIt was then that we made our unholy bargain: we forsook the stars and pledged ourselves to the Nereids, to Shada."
"3952276-1-6132";"I had sellswords with me. They charged through the Gate, but I was attacked by Daedra. I … don't know if anyone survived. I fled.\n\nIf you'll help, give me another chance at this, I don't care what it costs—I'm going through that portal."
"3952276-1-6145";"So many! Held for torture, for parts. For amusement. You can't hear the screams from up here, but I assure you they are uttered."
"3952276-1-6157";"They're asking the Star-Gazers to help them put the pieces back together or some such nonsense. Even offered to let me touch some strange relic to see the truth.\n\nBut let me tell you, nothing good has ever come from touching strange relics."
"3952276-1-6159";"Something awakened in the Citadel—or took residence. We Undaunted decided to find out what, and I still mean to. Whatever it is, it's fierce. Undaunted don't just disappear.\n\nI came here searching for anyone else willing to go."
"3952276-1-6160";"In the belly of a Dragon? Lost in some hollow? You never know with the Undaunted. The title for first at the top is still up for grabs. You know, if you live that long."
"3952276-1-6161";"That's generous of you, though I hope you know what you offer.\n\nNerien'eth is more powerful than any lich I've ever encountered. If you're going to help, we should head to his study. He controls these Crypts, and I'll wager that's where he'll be."
"3952276-1-6162";"She's in Stros M'Kai, adding to her crew. The ship's got enough sailors to keep her afloat, but that's about it.\n\nIf you want to lend a hand, talk to our boatswain, <<1>>. He's on deck."
"3952276-1-6163";"Squeamish? How disappointing.\n\nBut our interests are aligned. The Scaled Court threatens all of Craglorn. If my acolytes lend them their considerable power, the task of defeating the cult becomes that much harder. Kill them for me and we both win."
"3952276-1-6165";"He was headed to <<1>>, an old fort on <<2>>.\n\nMy ship won't return there for some time, but a boatswain on the far dock can take you. Look for <<3>>."
"3952276-1-6169";"Someone named Rana needs aid on Bleakrock. She asked for volunteers, but we've our own problems in <<1>>. No one signed up.\n\nHer boatswain <<2>> is down by the docks if you want to ask about it. Or you can stay here. Either choice means danger."
"3952276-1-6188";"A vision of the future. A future where that spirit escapes these caverns and runs rampant across the continent. I saw the cities of Tamriel, shattered and over-grown.\n\nThat spirit wants us dead—Men, Mer, Khajiit. It doesn't give a damn."
"3952276-1-6190";"Into the Valley of Scars, but they may as well have gone to Secunda. The valley's a fortress. Still, you look tougher than a five-legged wamasu.\n\nSave my guards if you can. If you can't, bring back something we can give to their families."
"3952276-1-6192";"It understands! The Scaled Court invades our valley. Tricks our chief with false promises. And it's all because of the liar, Agganor! \n\nBurn their standards. Kill Agganor and mount his helmet on a pike. Do this, little goat, and the stones will sing!"
"3952276-1-6198";"Auriel must guide your steps for you to return today.  I … accept your offer.\n\nNerien'eth is more powerful than I have ever known him to be. If we're to contest with him, we should go to his study up ahead—it's where he'll be."
"3952276-1-6207";"The better question might be, what can't they do? If they locate a large source of nirncrux and figure out how to use it, well … anything is possible!\n\nSo tell me. Have you come to stop these Serpent-loving, thrice-damned nuisances or what?"
"3952276-1-6219";"I've seen you in action. You're my best hope for stopping the mantikoras. Unnatural beasts! Did you know the Court created them?\n\nThe creation process starts in Fearfangs Cavern. There, we must destroy the scorpion matron and her nests."
"3952276-1-6229";"You're my better plan! Between my cheerful optimism and your proclivity for violence, there's no way we can lose.\n\nAnyway, you'll help, right? Meet me in the ruined tower on the nearby hill."

"3952276-1-6646";"Yeah. He wants to make sure the hagraven lurking there, Kraala Birdsong, doesn't try to steal the eggs back. Cut that beast down before you leave the cavern.\n\nIf you have more questions, he's just there in the next room. Good luck."
"3952276-1-6649";"He gave me this little orb-thing. Says you can use it to stun the machines. It should capture the information he needs at the same time.\n\nHe wants the Guardian destroyed, too. Called it a ""liability."" He's over there if you need more information."
"3952276-1-6653";"Yeah. I don't know if she sees her as competition or some sort of threat, but <<1>> also wants you to kill <<2>>. She was willing to pay extra for that. I'm all for extra pay.\n\nIf you want more details, you can ask her yourself. She's right outside."
"3952276-1-6654";"The people want their loved ones' spirits freed and that necromancer dead.\n\nTake this. If you beat a skeleton or zombie almost to pieces, you can use this <<1>> to cut its spirit loose. Thazeg can tell you more. He's over there by the shrine."
"3952276-1-6659";"We know which giant smashed the chief. I want to return the favor. That'll show the clan I'm a good contender, which would help keep the clan together.\n\nThing is, I'm no tracker. Care to help me find the bastard?"

"3952276-1-6661";"Ogres. Apparently, they tore the books to pieces. I'll mark their lairs on your map.\n\n<<1>> blames one ogre in particular. <<2>>. She wants him dead and what's left of her books returned. If you want to know more, talk to her. She's just over there."
"3952276-1-6662";"Doesn't matter. Light the brazier to begin the Rites of Praise and Scorn. Malacath will guide you through Hammer's Bypass and Temper's Fork, if you are worthy of his regard. \n\nVengeance, for Malacath. Promise me you'll light the pyre—swear it!"
"3952276-1-6663";"This totem should do the trick—take it. <<1>> says it has the power to disperse pockets of corruption.\n\n<<2>> is behind this, I know it. When you eliminate the corruption, eliminate him too. Ushang might know more. He's just over there."
"3952276-1-6664";"A beast called Zandadunoz the Reborn. That name is well-earned. He just won't stay dead.\n\nThe worms have built a series of obelisks on the frontier. Examine these pillars and kill any cultists you find. Talk to Lilyameh if you need some guidance."
"3952276-1-6665";"He says he uncovered some Dwarf junk buried in the snow up north, and it led to something big. ""Nyzchaleft,"" I think? Bah. Dwarf mischief.\n\nInvestigate the machines and take care of this thing he discovered. He's over there if you want more details."
"3952276-1-6666";"At first? Robbery. But now they're abducting travelers and taking them off into the wilderness. That Imperial caravaneer over there, <<1>>, has leads on where. I'll mark the locations on your map.\n\nShe's also identified their leader, King-Chief Edu."
"3952276-1-6667";"The king himself has requested your presence at his private tavern here in Orsinium.\n\nYou must have made quite an impression! You'll have to share your secrets with me some time."

"3952276-1-6676";"How could it not? The temple, the moot. This is the battle that tests our resolve. We need to stop Kurog. His good intentions have become twisted, corrupted.\n\nBesides, if Solgra doesn't live to refute Kurog's story, we'll all be branded as traitors."

"3952276-1-6678";"Ah—one more thing.\n\nThere is a woman here in the city—a Dragonguard warrior calling herself the ""Drake of Blades."" She has brought us valuable intelligence, but her motives are too murky for my liking. If you meet her, be watchful."
"3952276-1-6679";"One last thing.\n\nThere's a woman here in the city—a Dragonguard warrior calling herself the ""Drake of Blades."" She's brought us some valuable intelligence, but she's up to some mischief, I know it. If you meet her, stay watchful."
"3952276-1-6682";"Before I give you the name, I would like to propose a challenge. An opportunity to demonstrate your prowess. Indulge me and I will reward you. \n\nMy challenge is, of course, a secondary concern. As long as the target dies, the Sacrament is fulfilled."

"3952276-1-6698";"Care to help me turn the tide on these crooks then? I happen to know that their swindler of a Dock Master doesn't trust his gold to Anvil's banks. \n\nIf you help me pay the fool out of his own pocket, you can keep the lion's share of the bounty."
"3952276-1-6699";"I'm not sure. The language of the sea confuses me.\n\nWe just need to charter a ship to Sentinel, but that disagreeable captain took the last of our gold. We want to work, but no one will hire us. Perhaps you could serve as our agent in this matter?"

"3952276-1-6728";"Oh, most definitely! Luckily, the prince discovered his uncle's treachery and trapped the necromancers inside the tomb. Priests were gathered to create a great seal to make sure they couldn't escape.\n\nUnfortunately, pirates decided to loot the tomb."
"3952276-1-6730";"We're not sure, but that's where he requested to meet. He has a camp there which he's using for his own clandestine purposes.\n\nBefore you go, talk to Mirabelle. She has information concerning the Count that could prove useful to your mission."

"3952276-1-7004";"It understands! The Scaled Court invades our valley. Tricks our chief with false promises. And it's all because of the liar, Agganor! \n\nBurn their standards. Kill Agganor and mount his helmet on a pike. Do this, little goat, and the stones will sing!"
"3952276-1-7005";"The better question might be, what can't they do? If they locate a large source of nirncrux and figure out how to use it, well … anything is possible!\n\nSo tell me. Have you come to stop these Serpent-loving, thrice-damned nuisances or what?"
"3952276-1-7007";"I've seen you in action. You're my best hope for stopping the mantikoras. Unnatural beasts! Did you know the Court created them?\n\nThe creation process starts in Fearfangs Cavern. There, we must destroy the scorpion matron and her nests."
"3952276-1-7008";"You're my better plan! Between my cheerful optimism and your proclivity for violence, there's no way we can lose.\n\nAnyway, you'll help, right? Meet me in the ruined tower on the nearby hill."
"3952276-1-7009";"Perhaps. I thought he was nothing more than a myth before I entered the catacombs. But then I heard a voice inside my mind, beckoning me into the depths.\n\nI fled to seek the blessing of the Eight, for without it I know my soul will be forfeit."
"3952276-1-7010";"And once again you offer aid before I need to ask. Thank you.\n\nMeet me at the Howling Sepulchers to the north. The ancient Nedes will regard us as intruders, so be wary. Perhaps we'll even run into Kelmen along the way."
"3952276-1-7011";"That's terrible! The Nedes sealed those creatures away for a reason!\n\nThe texts I discovered gave me an understanding of the wards. I need to try to replicate them. But I can't do it alone. Will you keep the creatures at bay while I cast the spell?"
"3952276-1-7013";"Little Leaf should be somewhere along the road just beyond the northeast passage. Let her know I sent you and she'll trust you implicitly.\n\nShe has a very trusting soul."
"3952276-1-7015";"If only it were that simple. As Titus loses parts of himself, his connection to me is severed. I can no longer reach him with my blessing.\n\nTitus has done everything I asked of him. It is time to send him home. Will you help him remember who he is?"
"3952276-1-7017";"<It appears that Ranev's pilgrimage began and ended at a standing stone to the southwest of Dragonstar known as the ""Gray Menhir."" The other destinations are scattered throughout Craglorn, deep within various caves and tombs.>"
"3952276-1-7018";"That's not all. Seems there's some sort of creature locked up in the depths of the ruins. They may worship the thing, use it as an excuse to raid—I don't really care.\n\nI want you to kill it so they stay home for a good long while. You understand?"
"3952276-1-7020";"Grab the <<z:1>> and bring it to me. The other caches are trapped decoys, so watch yourself.\n\nWhile you're there, destroy the toughest creature you can find. It's a matter of principle."
"3952276-1-7022";"That lair is run by the Lady of Lace, but it's Mephala they all answer to. Worship, more like. Pah.\n\nFind the Lady of Lace's idol and defile it. She won't toy with you then."
"3952276-1-7041";"You need <<z:1>> and some kind of relic to summon that many Daedra.\n\nKill the Daedra for the <<z:1>>. When you have enough, throw them on the <<z:2>> to weaken the relic. Then you can smash it, and banish them for good."
"3952276-1-7043";"Seek her out in Tel Naga. If I know my heart, she will be sunning herself in the light of some book. Always reading, that one. Always learning.\n\nIf all goes to plan, she will read her books beside me in the boughs of a Hist. Soon, I hope."
"3952276-1-7044";"No—probably not. Just get them back to the altar from which they came.\n\nOh, and kill the Daedra behind this. Already lost three Undaunted to its scheme."
"3952276-1-7048";"Not exactly. I want you light the memorial pyres in the barrow. I don't know why, but it really angers the draugr.\n\nWhile the pyres are lit, find the toughest draugr around and pound it until it stops. If you think you can handle an enraged draugr."
"3952276-1-7050";"Canon Llevule. He remained behind after we retreated from the tomb. I know he wants to get back inside and ask Lord Vivec's questions, but there's no way he can get past the Daedra or ask the questions on his own.\n\nMay the Three grant him wisdom."
"3952276-1-7054";"It isn't. That's why you're going to eat it whole before you take on the bandit leader in those ruins.\n\nIt's not poisonous. Well, not too poisonous—just enough to fill your nose and your guts with quicksand. Go on, I dare you."
"3952276-1-7058";"I'll mark your map with the route. Travel to each place, shed your clothes, and take a flying leap!\n\nWarm yourself at the bonfires before leaving. And share a drink with anyone else who takes the Plunge!"
"3952276-1-7081";"There are only two keys to the mine. Benar keeps one in our manor house. The other is carried by the mine's foreman, Nox. I want you to procure a key, either one, and then search the mine for any sign of mischief. Report back with your findings."
"3952276-1-7084";"What do I know of spells and bewitchments? I suppose the witch needs to uncast it or something. She has to be close by. Please, find her and make her set me free! If my friends saw me like this ….\n\nFind that evil, red-eyed creature, I beg you!"
"3952276-1-7085";"Of course not! Tirwin is a slave—my mother's slave! I tried to buy her freedom, but Mother laughed at the mere suggestion that I'd be allowed to sully our reputation with a ""n'wah"" bride.\n\nPerhaps an outlander's offer wouldn't rouse her suspicion?"
"3952276-1-7086";"A <<z:1>> such as this showed they were in friendly company. Now, it's a symbol of participation.\n\nBest to experience the Lava Foot Stomp for yourself. I'll mark the taverns on your map. Now, go forth and dance!"
"3952276-1-7087";"There are three! Ambassadors of each Alliance meet in Auridon to speak with righteous purpose. No doubt to argue the shape of the negotiating table, or which wine to serve next.\n\nThey should take themselves less seriously, don't you think?"
"3952276-1-7088";"Openly? No. Some work against him in secret, but he sics his Black Snail mercenaries on anyone who opposes him publicly.\n\nDon't believe me? Ask him yourself. He covets Tel Mora tower, but until Dratha dies, he holds court in the gathering house."
"3952276-1-7089";"I find that people lead much happier lives when they don't trouble themselves with details.\n\nNow, Vvardenfell is littered with Daedric shrines. Seven of these shrines contain powerful magicked stones. You must find these stones and bring them to me."
"3952276-1-7094";"Here, everything in this performance kit will let you experience for yourself.\n\nGo to Alcaire Castle in Stormhaven and perform for the crowds. They're quite friendly, so don't fear your time in front of them!"
"3952276-1-7102";"No idea. Don't know much about Wood Elf justice, don't care to think about it.\n\nI also didn't ask why they want the Heritance leader's liver. But they do, so … wear thick gloves."
"3952276-1-7105";"Go fishing! Best to catch them in Shadowfen's waters—but if you hate to fish, you can still feed the hungry. Trade with friends, or seek them from a guild trader.\n\nWhen you have enough, deliver them to <<1>> at <<2>>."
"3952276-1-7107";"Yeah. Came down on us like an arse-branded ogre. \n\nWe gave as good as we got. It wasn't enough. Khartag and a few slaves fled to the cavern, Camonna gangsters right behind. Without help, they're as good as dead. Don't suppose you're the heroic type?"
"3952276-1-7110";"Not yet, no. Like I said, even the smallest mistake could spell disaster. It's still too early.\n\nI can't say more—not here, anyway. Too many listening ears. Meet me in my new quarters, all right? I have a plan that might speed things along."
"3952276-1-7111";"Indirectly. My Sun-in-Shadow leaves nothing to chance. She must climb to a higher branch on the Telvanni tree—one she calls ""retainer."" Once she claims this title, she will set me free.\n\nSo, I plant myself like a sapling and wait."
"3952276-1-7112";"So you'll help? Excellent.\n\nI need evidence—testimony. Many of the marshal's prisoners are toiling on plantations outside Suran. Talk to them. Gather some proof of Hlaren's corruption, then meet me at Ules Manor."
"3952276-1-7113";"We're to cleanse a malicious presence on lands recently acquired by our employer. I know very little about the area other than the Ashlanders think it's cursed.\n\nWhatever the presence is, it likely won't sit idle while we exorcize it. Hence, you."
"3952276-1-7114";"You just need to help reset the balance. Head to the mine and kill as many kwama as you can. Don't forget to off the queen's new sweetheart as well.\n\nSalvi's in Vivec City if you have any other questions. Talk to him about payment when you're done."
"3952276-1-7115";"The cretin's saying I'm not a mage, but I am! I just happen to love alchemy.\n\nHe must think there's a lot of coin to be made here. The fool. If I get my hands on him I'll …. Sorry, Dark Elf temper. It's just that this business is my life."
"3952276-1-7116";"Just get rid of the nix-ox and collect some mushroom samples. Easy. And don't bother asking me what he's up to—Telvanni wizard nonsense of some sort.\n\nHead to the caldera and deal with it. Felder's in the city if you need more information."
"3952276-1-7123";"Out of thin air, shouting nonsense about defeating the Anka-Ra. The Guard took him to Bangkorai Gate, if you're headed that way. He's the indecent Imperial going on about Celestial This-And-That.\n\nIf you see him, tell him he owes me a thousand gold!"
"3952276-1-7124";"Trapped? No! Don't be absurd. It's not as if they're itching to leave.\n\nLook, House Redoran will sort this out. Speak to Foreman Lathdar if you have other questions. He's just over there, by the mine entrance. I have other matters to attend to."
"3952276-1-7127";"The circle summoned atronachs to destroy the Dark Anchor. Instead, they turned on the circle! One of the Celestials must have caused it.\n\nI'm no conjurer—I wasn't next to the summoning when it happened. It's the only reason I escaped to seek help!"
"3952276-1-7131";"I last spoke with her at the old farm near Dragonstar—try there.\n\nIf she departed, I'm certain she left word of her travels."
"3952276-1-7132";"Drovos managed to create a royal queen egg. If the egg hatches, our native kwama will be wiped out. He's gone mad, sera, and all of Vvardenfell may pay the price.\n\nI need you to destroy this egg, wipe out the scribs-in-waiting, and deal with Drovos."
"3952276-1-7133";"If you're offering? I suspect Ashlanders are behind the disappearances, but I don't have the numbers to chase them off. \n\nIf you can sneak into their camp near Molag Mar and find me proof of their involvement, I could finally get some reinforcements."
"3952276-1-7139";"Something drains my energy. Find Archcanon Tarvus in his office and ask if he gleaned anything useful from the ritual. If not, I know his earlier research indicated new avenues to investigate.\n\nGo where he tells you and learn what you can."
"3952276-1-7140";"You will help? Oh, bless you!\n\nThis one planted his crops in a cavern nearby. Zainsipilu. Please, retrieve my notes and poison the water. Without proper irrigation, the plants will wither. It pains me to kill them, but these bandits must not prosper!"
"3952276-1-7142";"Revus … I want you to find that scrawny little wizard and tell him the bill's come due. He wants to help? Well, now's the horking time.\n\nIf he doesn't fix this, we'll sic the Redoran on him. He doesn't want that. Believe me."
"3952276-1-7145";"Unfortunately, yes.\n\nI wonder if we might aid each other? Despite my missteps, I do know a great deal about Ashlander culture. I could help you earn their favor. In return, you could find out if they know anything about my family's tomb."
"3952276-1-7148";"The Heart of Lorkhan. As if it even exists.\n\nThe irony is that this ruin really does contain an item of power. A Dwemer relic called a Bthark Prism. If you help me rescue my aides, retrieve my rod, and obtain this prism, I'd happily compensate you."
"3952276-1-7149";"You should speak to Councilor Eris. He's opened the kinhouse to interview potential recruits. Freelancers, as it were.\n\nIf you're interested, go speak to the councilor. The longer Veya remains missing, the more distressed Councilor Eris becomes."
"3952276-1-7152";"The earth's beating heart! It thunders day and night, shaping their twisted Heartstones and wicked blades that thirst for blood. Those of us they take to the Forge never return.\n\nWill you spare the others from that fate?"
"3952276-1-7154";"Reachmen and minotaurs with fearless, hungry eyes. They charge our gates howling like mad dogs.\n\nMany fled them from the outlying villages, helpless to stop their loved ones from being dragged off to some ugly fate. The hold was their last hope."
"3952276-1-7158";"You see right through me, outlander. I have more worries than a kwama queen has eggs.\n\nI'm talking about Chodala's sister. Seryn claims to want to help, to want peace, but I don't trust her. Seek out Barilzar, but be wary of the Ashlander's sister."
"3952276-1-7159";"Upsets in planar demarcation are remarkably complex. Study must be free from distraction. An impossibility while constructs continuously spill from the rift.\n\nWe must find their source and shut it down."
"3952276-1-7166";"I should have listened. Before I knew, my Nevena was gone. Something changed in her eyes. Made my blood run cold. I never even saw the knife.\n\nManaged to stop the bleeding, but I'm not going anywhere soon. I've lost her. Maybe for good."
"3952276-1-7167";"It's just a feeling. That relic had a … I don't know, a draw to it. Like it wanted me to bring it here. It sounds crazy, but her brother sought me out. \n\nHe seemed convinced it was the cause and where it came from was key to where she was heading."
"3952276-1-7169";"Eventually, but we need to be cautious. If Chodala is as respected as you say, attacking him would start a war we can't afford to partake in.\n\nGo to Ald'ruhn and talk to his sister, Seryn. I don't trust her either, but she worked with you before."
"3952276-1-7170";"No, she has not. All to the good, I guess. A finless fish weakens the shoal.\n\nBut enough about me. You, my friend, are a mighty swimmer. Seek her out in her stone dwelling-place. If I know my heart, she will certainly have a task for you."
"3952276-1-7171";"If only there was a way to give Lord Vivec some energy—wait, that's it! A Blessing Stone! Find the Overseer and retrieve another stone from the construction site.\n\nOh please, hurry! I've never seen Lord Vivec in such a desperate state!"
"3952276-1-7172";"It allows one to archive memories for future generations. I hope to do this for my children, who have grown estranged.\n\nInvoke my stone at the locations I've marked on your map and the memories I wish to archive will manifest."
"3952276-1-7173";"Kill them. Again. They seem to think they're still in some old battle, their last I'd wager, and they attack anyone who approaches.\n\nAndromo may know more. He's been studying the tomb for some time now."
"3952276-1-7174";"Clavicus Vile distracted me, weakened me … all to locate the Clockwork City. Perhaps we require a Daedra … to fight a Daedra.\n\nAzura's champion, Seryn … in Archcanon's office. Seek guidance from her patron. But hurry, my time grows short …."
"3952276-1-7175";"Strange, I know. She's enthralled several sailors with a song enchantment, and now no one can get close to the wreck. Valga Celatus can tell you more. She posted the job and is currently in Vivec City.\n\nHead over to her and see what you can do."
"3952276-1-7176";"Great Zexxin has been spotted to the northeast of the Erabenimsun camp near Nchuleftingth. Nix-ox and other creatures gather near the yellow rocks and pools in the area. Search for signs of Great Zexxin's passing and follow the tracks to your quarry."
"3952276-1-7177";"We call it Tarra-Suj, which means ""powerful hunter"" in my people's language. Our camp near Nchuleftingth suffers as the creature becomes ever more bold.\n\nKill common nix-hounds and Tarra-Suj will appear. Try to fare better than my hunters, outlander."
"3952276-1-7178";"Check the fetcherfly nests northwest of our camp near Nchuleftingth. Disturb the nests and eventually Writhing Sveeth will appear to protect them. Just be careful not to take on too many of the pests at once. They like to swarm."
"3952276-1-7179";"We call such creatures Mother Jagged-Claw, a name awarded to the largest, most aggressive matriarch to crawl from the churning sea.\n\nIf you want to attract the mother mudcrab's attention, disturb the mud piles where she lays her eggs."
"3952276-1-7180";"East of our village, hiding among the mounds of ash. If you disturb the mounds, you should draw it out—provided it doesn't ambush you first.\n\nOnce the dire ash beetle appears, your skill will determine the outcome of the encounter."
"3952276-1-7181";"Head toward the camp near Nchuleftingth and search for signs of Old Stomper's attacks. A good tracker can follow the blood trail back to the creature's nest.\n\nJust be wary. Old Stomper has survived these many seasons by being ferocious and cruel."
"3952276-1-7182";"We recently tracked the kagouti pack east, to the other side of Red Mountain. Pick off the members of its pack and eventually King Razor-Tusk will show its fearsome visage.\n\nJust be wary, for the smell of blood will drive it into a frenzy."
"3952276-1-7183";"This may surprise you, but the higher I climb and the more powerful I become, the lonelier it gets.\n\nA true Telvanni life always involves some seclusion, but I value our friendship—and Eoki's affection. I'd hate to lose either of you."
"3952276-1-7184";"I need you to collect Dwemer parts and tools from the ruins of Nchuleft. The Zainab tribe used to loot it for items to trade. \n\nDredase-Hlarar can tell you more. Give the items to him once you're done."
"3952276-1-7185";"Head over to his tower and see what's going on. You've also been asked to collect any research notes you may find for the apprentice to study later.\n\nVaram can fill you in on the details. She'll also have your pay if you manage to complete the job."
"3952276-1-7187";"Head to Sulipund Grange, gather some relic pieces, and try to take care of the Hunger that's protecting the area.\n\nTirvina Avani should be in the city with more information. Nervous little thing. She'll have your pay once you're done with the task."
"3952276-1-7188";"That may be an oversimplification, but I suppose your statement is accurate.\n\nI walk a narrow path between House Councilor and loving father. Unfortunately, the former often supersedes the latter. That's why I want to speak to Veya again."
"3952276-1-7189";"I suspect slavers were involved. Which means they had help here in town. I find that unacceptable.\n\nDiscover who doused the lamp fire. They'll lead us to the slavers. Question Delms, who was on duty that night. He's in the lighthouse."
"3952276-1-7190";"If these treasonous malcontents insist on harboring sticks firmly in their hindquarters, then they can at least have the decency to keep them in bloom!\n\nFind the grumps in my domain and pelt them with these enchanted petals until morale improves!"
"3952276-1-7191";"I'll return to Sadrith Mora and continue my studies. Talk to Eoki. Bury myself in a good novel. \n\nCome and visit. It would be great to just sit and talk for a while, as friends. I still owe you that cup of tea, right?"
"3952276-1-7192";"That gap in the model—that's where we'll find the lost Library of Andule! Once you go and locate the exact spot, we can start examining the records related to our earliest Velothi settlers.\n\nWhat do you say? Ready for one more adventure?"
"3952276-1-7193";"Head along the coast, to the ruins of Yasammidan that overlooks the sea. It was once a shrine to Mehrunes Dagon. Find any relics you can and bring them to me.\n\nHistory fades if measures aren't taken."
"3952276-1-7194";"To the south, between here and Balmora. Slay the brigands and recover any relics they may have stolen.\n\nBring the relics back to me and the Urshilaku will keep them safe for the day when Daedric worship returns to the fore."
"3952276-1-7195";"The ruins lie to the north, to the east of West Gash. Go there and put an end to the cult and remove temptation from the House of Troubles. \n\nReturn any relics they removed from the shrine to me for safekeeping."
"3952276-1-7196";"Head to the northern coast, west of the Forgotten Wastes, and find the ruins. Clear out as many exiles as you can. There's no hope for them now and they have become a blight on the land. \n\nRecover the relics and bring them to me for safekeeping."
"3952276-1-7197";"The ruins lie far to the north, west of the Forgotten Wastes. I do not know what dangers surround the ancient shrine, so tread carefully.\n\nReturn to me when you've collected a good amount of relics."
"3952276-1-7198";"The ruins lie to the northwest of Ald'ruhn. Travel to the shrine and slay as many of these vampires as you can. They lair deep below ground where we cannot go, but every death you deal weakens the pack.\n\nRetrieve any relics you find and return to me."
"3952276-1-7199";"Travel north and west from Ald'ruhn and seek out the ruins near the coast. Gather whatever relics you can find from the exterior ruins and bring them back to me.\n\nAvoid the interior of the shrine, however. The place is cursed."
"3952276-1-7200";"Free her from her minders, so we may grow fat together! Take a token of my love, the sickly-sweet brownish flesh of mudcrab apples, and she will know I sent you.\n\nThe guard cannot know their king bade the abscencing of his bride. Use cautiousness."
"3952276-1-7202";"You do understand! And Naryu implied you were as dense as the ash storms coming off Red Mountain. Good to know even the Mother of Blades can be wrong. \n\nVeya's upset, and not just about her brother. She wanted to go with Naryu."
"3952276-1-7203";"Alves Droth, the functionary investigating these thefts, believes the thieves have established themselves in Pulk. Go retrieve the stolen taxes and records. This city needs those monies.\n\nAlves can be found here in Vivec, if you need more to go on."
"3952276-1-7205";"""To redeem this voucher and receive your special cake, look for the chef and his bakery barge in the ports of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, and the Harbor District of Daggerfall. We guarantee it will be delicious!"""
"3952276-1-7206";"There are some, um, ""local attractions"" that should have what I'm looking for, but they're no place for royalty.\n\nIf you would risk venturing out on my behalf, I'll ensure you play a key role in today's festivities!"
"3952276-1-7212";"""Show your appreciation or your arse to our generous rulers as they regale their subjects with their regality. Pranks, performances, and potables on offer in Daggerfall, Ebonheart, and Vulkhel Guard.\n\n""Come one, come all, to the Festival of Fools!"""
"3952276-1-7221";"Will get Vatola and his soldiers killed! I know the process. Turning in a writ can take hours, maybe even an entire day! I'll leave Naryu a note. She can meet us at the fort.\n\nI'm going. Either come with me or get out of my way."
"3952276-1-7223";"Well, that's the rub. Literally. The ancient families of Vvardenfell hid the location of the library and then placed clues to find it at their ancestral tombs.\n\nI need someone to take rubbings of these clues. Will you help me solve this mystery?"
"3952276-1-7226";"Yes. Servants of the Twilight Queen. My friends and I decipher visions of the future for other votaries of Azura. Unfortunately, something is abducting us one by one.\n\nBring this crystal to Pariah Abbey. Our Rose Mother will tell you the rest."
"3952276-1-7234";"No, she has not. All to the good, I guess. A finless fish weakens the shoal.\n\nBut enough about me. You, my friend, are a mighty swimmer. Seek her out in her stone dwelling-place. If I know my heart, she will certainly have a task for you."
"3952276-1-7235";"<<1>>'s reports speak of numerous rituals being performed by the Worm Cult to summon these Daedra. We must put a stop to them once and for all. \n\nI would seek out Savile before you attempt to do so. She may not have departed Vivec yet."
"3952276-1-7236";"Search the Camonna Tong campsite in Khartag Point and eliminate their commander. This should slow their progress.\n\nVorar Vendu has brought this issue to our attention. He's in Vivec City if you need more information. He'll also have your reward."
"3952276-1-7241";"Misinformation. Take these two notes regarding moon-sugar's growth process. Leave one near their crop and one near their research. Deal with the bandits however you like.\n\nEvos is nearby if you need more information. He'll also have your reward."
"3952276-1-7243";"Confiscate an egg from the primary egg chamber and find some breeding research describing their methods. You'll also need to plant poison kwama feed that will help control the mine's population. \n\nYou may speak with <<1>> for more information."
"3952276-1-7244";"We were exploring the Bal Fell ruins when everyone left me. I expect such behavior from the hired help, but Stibbons? He's usually more dependable than that.\n\nLocate the mages and Stibbons, then use this signal wand so I can join you."
"3952276-1-7251";"I trust her. It's just …. When she proposed using the Telvanni's rules against them, it seemed like wisdom. But murder? Recapturing Khajiit who meant to escape? I fear she has lost perspective.\n\nI must speak with her. Can you find her for me?"
"3952276-1-7277";"I am the personal assistant to Narsis Dren and I know a great deal about a good many things! I found the old scroll that mentioned the treasure, after all.\n\nNarsis has been gone a long time, though. Even missed lunch today, and he never skips a meal."
"3952276-1-7283";"A rift opened when we were shaping the workshop below the tower. Master Fyr believes there is a connection to the living gods. He's sure to explore the rift once his expedition is assembled.\n\nMy sister could tell you more if that interests you."
"3952276-1-7286";"To start, retrieve the Archcanon's Signet from the Hall of Wisdom. It is time to appoint a new head priest. I shall gather my people and meet you at my statue on the central canton.\n\nIt shall be a glorious ceremony, my friend!"
"3952276-1-7289";"You aren't at fault for the late delivery, so Fyr shouldn't do anything to you. Won't do anything to you, I mean! I guarantee it!\n\nBesides, I'll let you keep the payment he owes me as well. I'd rather avoid the situation altogether at this point."
"3952276-1-7294";"You'll find the people of Bleakrock all across the island.\n\nDarj, the hunter, went to Skyshroud Barrow. Eiman's out at Orkey's Hollow with his sister, Rolunda. Seyne, my sergeant, is out at Hozzin's Folly."
"3952276-1-7295";"Chodala won't hand over the staff. And trying to take it could lead to a war we can't afford to wage.\n\nI suggest you go to Ald'ruhn and talk to his sister, Seryn. I don't trust her either, but she worked with you before. Perhaps she'll do so again."
"3952276-1-7297";"You have already shown your respect for our ways. Return to Ald'ruhn and seek out Zanammu of the Zainab tribe. Ask him how you might continue to further your friendship with our tribes. Perhaps in learning from us, we can also learn from you."
"3952276-1-7298";"It's up to our leaders to make that decision, but they're still in Ald'ruhn. You could see Zanammu, tell him you want to work with the tribes. Show us that some outsiders can be trusted. He can direct you to the other tribes."
"3952276-1-7299";"Return to Ald'ruhn. Seek out Zanammu of tribe Zainab. He has a particular fondness for outlanders and is less likely to try to kill you. From there, he can direct you to those who will guide you on the path to becoming a friend of the clans."
"3952276-1-7318";"Haven't the foggiest. My people will explain their needs when you find them. The details aren't my concern, I only care about results. \n\nEnsure they cleanse Valenvaryon, the ruin east of here, and you'll be handsomely rewarded. Do we have a deal?"
"3952276-1-7319";"Your anger is understandable.  \n\nA true Telvanni life always involves some seclusion. The higher I climb, the lonelier it gets. But I truly value our friendship, and Eoki's affection. I'd hate to lose either of you."
"3952276-1-7323";"Your hands, crow-friend! Our wings lack such ugly but useful appendages!\n\nNow listen well. Plunder armor of the most ornate sort. Pieces that make a statement! Impractical things, but pretty when polished and shined. Yes, bring such items to me!"
"3952276-1-7324";"Check his rectory in the west wing of the Basilica. He hides in there sometimes to nurse a bruised ego, or write passive-aggressive memoranda.\n\nI'll try to settle the apostles nerves. Honestly, my nerves could use some settling."
"3952276-1-7334";"Terari Heladren was … ahead of her time. It was fear that led to her expulsion, not reason. I see that now.\n\nPlease, find her. Tell her I'll make it right, if she'll save my life. There is no one among the order I can turn to. She is my only hope."
"3952276-1-7336";"The skimmer requires a specific kind of wire mesh, and we've only been able to find it in the Halls of Regulation. <<1>> will need more of the stuff if we want to continue collecting. She can tell you more about the process, if you're still willing."
"3952276-1-7337";"Well, there's a bit more to it. \n\nYou'll also need to gather the metal pellets used to help with the grinding process.\nWe can only find the darn things in the Fundament. Belan would be happy to talk your ear off about if you want to know more."
"3952276-1-7338";"Well, we can't collect the strands without more lodestones, and the one <<1>> created attracts the stuff like nothing else. You'll find the parts needed in the Mnemonic Planisphere, but be careful. I've heard there's trouble about there lately."
"3952276-1-7339";"Issue is we got to keep the sap warm or it becomes useless. We've discovered a type of coal that does the trick. You'll need to go to the Reactor District to find it, but it's the only thing that stays hot long enough.\n\n<<1>> can tell you more."
"3952276-1-7340";"Just another mystery of Clockwork I don't understand.\n\nOh, and you'll need to get us more runelights. You'll find them behind this strange portal, not quite sure where it leads. Everyone but <<1>> was too afraid to go in, so you'll have to ask her."
"3952276-1-7341";"Now these satchels work, but they turn the plants so bitter no one will drink the tonics Aveberl makes. We've found a sweet syrup in the Wellspring that makes them tolerable, but you'll have to deal with the patrol factotums. \n\nStill interested?"
"3952276-1-7344";"I need to make sure no one else wanders into the portal.\n\nBut maybe you could go in and find Acolyte Variah. This perception tabulator automatically records whatever you experience and should be able to locate my associate. Take it and use it well."
"3952276-1-7345";"Hmm. I crossed staves with an Argonian mage once. He could leap through shadows—crossing long distances in seconds. Maybe that's the answer? Shadow portals of some kind?\n\nWe need more information. Inside perspective."
"3952276-1-7346";"You know I don't put much stock in hope. Sotha Sil prepares for every conceivable eventuality, but the Shadow is Sotha Sil. It's difficult to create countermeasures for yourself.\n\nWe can't count on Sotha Sil. This task falls to us. Are you ready?"
"3952276-1-7347";"In the short-term, I need Divayth Fyr. He took his leave to attend to matters outside my fortress. I wish to speak with both of you in a more private setting. \n\nPlease, find Fyr and then meet me at the Elegiac Replication."
"3952276-1-7348";"Fyr casts a long Aetherial shadow—it makes him difficult to miss. I sense … yes, he is in Mournhold. The Tribunal Temple. Conferring with Almalexia, perhaps?\n\nFind Divayth and tell him what is at stake. With any luck, we will find common cause."
"3952276-1-7349";"Yes, the ancient Dark Elf sorcerer.\n\nWhile Divayth and I do not always see eye to eye, he does not deserve to be slaughtered by his own shadow. My visions tell me that he is currently in Mournhold. You will find him in the Tribunal Temple."
"3952276-1-7350";"Of course. But if you do not come, he will find another. And you will be left behind—forever saddled with a coward's regret. Hardly a choice, by my estimation. \n\nService to Divayth Fyr is a great honor, sera. Think hard before refusing."
"3952276-1-7352";"The Everwound Wellspring, a wondrous oasis in this mechanical desert! Sotha Sil created the place, but the lector made plants grow in the metallic soil. Once every year, he distributes food and chooses an apprentice. You should come with me and see!"
"3952276-1-7355";"Hmm. Well, the fact that they arrived so soon after you revealed the Shadow is suspicious, but they seem more interested in simple mischief than anything else.\n\nAsk around the Chancel of Transaction. Perhaps one of our constables can tell you more."
"3952276-1-7356";"The Forge takes on a life of its own when it's gorged on slaughter. Once you've stoked it with the blood of your enemies, invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle before you shatter the murderous Earthgore Amalgam that's formed in its molten heart."
"3952276-1-7357";"The Reach army is led by a real titan of a minotaur. Wades through men like ants and spits fire, if you believe that.\n\nSounds the Jarl's warhorn in defiance of the beast and you're sure to have it seeing red before you lock horns!"
"3952276-1-7359";"Yes, exactly. You're a quick learner.\n\nI need someone who can fight off these cultists and help me return the stars to the Planisphere's sky. Please, you have to help us. This task is of the most vital importance!"
"3952276-1-7360";"Yes, a clockwork apostle named Varuni Arvel. Apparently, she's a member of the Congress of Calibration—the governing body here in the city.\n\nMy associates, Kireth and Raynor, are already working on a plan to earn her trust. Will you help us?"
"3952276-1-7361";"Truly? Why, that's most excellent! \n\nNow, the very fate of Clockwork City's clean water supply rests in our hands, so we must act quickly. I know the locations of the machines in need of repairs, but we'll have to search around for specific parts."
"3952276-1-7366";"No, and I can't imagine how hard something like that is to come by in Clockwork City. Maurice never did say how he came by a case of it, but I'm not one to pry.\n\nCouldn't hurt to do some asking around though, right?"
"3952276-1-7367";"One more thing, a special request. Tubabi loved nix-hound meat before she wound up here.\n\n<<1>> raises the best you can find, but I can't afford his prices. I'd really like to impress her and I know where he keeps his stash."
"3952276-1-7369";"Worse. Initially, I dismissed it as boredom, fatigue, or even the first signs of senility. But now, after observing him at length, I can say with certainty—this is not the Sotha Sil I know.\n\nThere's Daedric mischief here, and we will root it out."
"3952276-1-7370";"The way deeper into Fang Lair is barred by powerful magic. I've yet to find a discreet way through, but with you here we might be able to disrupt the barrier by force. Give those necromancers a real taste of death and go from there.\n\nInterested?"
"3952276-1-7372";"Trapped on the other side of a broken bridge, I'm afraid. \n\nSay, you look capable. Would you mind escorting me through the <<1>> in order to reach my companions? It's vitally important we continue our expedition."
"3952276-1-7376";"I knew the Court could count on you! You always were my favorite of all the featherless curs.\n\nI'm feeling bold! Brazen, even. I desire ornate armor from far off lands. Bring me these things and I'll reward you in kind."
"3952276-1-7377";"It gave a repeated message, requesting to find its integral of memory in the Mnemonic Planisphere. \n\nYou seem like the adventuring sort. Do you think you could collect it for me? Rebuilding a factotum would just spring-load me into a council seat!"
"3952276-1-7379";"Hmm. I crossed staves with an Argonian mage once. He could leap through shadows—crossing long distances in seconds. Maybe that's the answer? Shadow portals of some kind?\n\nWe need more information. Inside perspective."
"3952276-1-7382";"Crunch, crackle, and snap. Hides and carapaces from the corpses of creatures, and Daedric husks that the Court can crumble and crush! Those would be most excellent!\n\nAnd for your assistance, I offer the usual compensation."
"3952276-1-7383";"We miss pecking at ectoplasm, essence, and bug-infested roots! Find these delicacies and return to me. I'll reward you spectacularly once the Court's hunger has been sated."
"3952276-1-7384";"If they insist on not dying, then a different tribute must be collected. Steal their tools of eating! Bring me their plates and bowls! If we can't eat, then neither can they. A fair and meaningful tribute that also teaches a lesson, yes?"
"3952276-1-7386";"We will seal the portal—after we learn everything we can about why it's here and what's on the other side. For your troubles, the apostles are willing to pay a substantial reward.\n\nGo see <<1>> if you need more information."
"3952276-1-7387";"An oracle of sorts. It's an unusual factotum with a penchant for the mystical and the dramatic.\n\nI fear Kamid plans to do something foolish—and dangerous. Perhaps you'd be willing to go to the Outlaws Refuge and talk to him? Keep him safe?"
"3952276-1-7388";"Unfortunately, she has ensconced herself deep in the Mechanical Fundament to meditate on the nature of the Sublime Piston. I haven't seen her in over a year, but I'm sure you'll have no trouble with the patrolling factotums."
"3952276-1-7389";"Travel to the Sanctuary of Verification. You must also gather the Imperfect's sequence plaques that have been scattered during previous battles. Many are found near the bridge to the chamber.\n\nPayment will be given upon completion of this task."
"3952276-1-7390";"The Wraith-of-Crows can be found within a portal to Evergloam, located in Exarchs' Egress. Take precautions before entering, such as enlisting teammates. Other threats are found in the surrounding area.\n\nDo you accept this contract?"
"3952276-1-7391";"Before I wounded his pride, we were planning to explore this marvelous machine world. He charged off to prove he didn't need my help, and we know how that's going to turn out!\n\nI'll let him cool off, but could you make sure he stays out of trouble?"
"3952276-1-7392";"Very perceptive. I knew you were the right person for the job!\n\nTalk to <<1>> if you want more details. Otherwise, head into the Shadow Cleft, locate the missing mage and the perception tabulator we provided, and return to claim your reward."
"3952276-1-7393";"Take this perception tabulator, return to the Shadow Cleft, and perform Favar's analysis. And while you're in there, try to find our poor initiate.\n\nIf you require additional details, talk to <<1>>. You can find him in the Grand Depository."
"3952276-1-7394";"You'll not only need to fend off the factotums, but collect saturated oil from them as well. We believe this oil to be crucial to the ventilation fan's maintenance.\n\nFor more information talk to <<1>>. She's our current expert on the subject."
"3952276-1-7395";"Coral crab eggs, from the reef between Corgrad and Lillandril. Handle them carefully, and beware the Queen of the Reef. That giant coral crab has killed many an ambitious gourmand, but if she has been perverted by unholy powers she must be purged."
"3952276-1-7396";"Yes. Ancient indriks like Caanerin enjoy a deep connection to Y'ffre—the forest god. They are very resilient—much like weeds. Luckily, the Sapiarchs erected warding stones to keep her from returning. \n\nKill Caanerin and activate those stones."
"3952276-1-7397";"I need you to destroy the tainted coral that serves as the primary ingredient for B'Korgen's alchemical concoctions. Then eliminate the Sload alchemist before he can unleash more terrors upon the island.\n\nI suggest you take companions on this one."
"3952276-1-7398";"We've also been requested to collect the beasts' feathers. Some Wood Elf merchants have offered us quite a bit of gold for them. It seems the Bosmer prize such things.\n\nIt should be easy enough to find some in the surrounding nests."
"3952276-1-7399";"Investigators on their way to Sil-Var-Woad's Royal Menagerie were killed by an escaped beast. I don't know what those zoo keepers are doing, but Graveld is running amok in the wilderness.\n\nKill it and retrieve the Scrolls of Oath from our Justiciars."
"3952276-1-7400";"Yes. A massive sea adder. It suns itself in the bay south of Sea Keep. Our navy won't be safe until it's dealt with.\n\nWorse, the ships it destroyed carried sensitive intelligence. I need you to search the shore and recover any logs you can."
"3952276-1-7401";"Replacement water filters need to be taken from factotums and installed. Naturally the Clockwork Apostles will reward you for this most important of tasks.\n\nFor more information speak to <<1>>. She's leading all maintenance."
"3952276-1-7402";"You need to exchange the galvanic engine's used commutators with new ones. Replacements can be found within the factotums. Naturally we offer a reward for anyone who can complete this task.\n\nFor more information talk to <<1>>."
"3952276-1-7403";"Really? Well, if you got me some fresh ones from the Halls of Regulation that'd be a start, but they aren't much good like that. Salas has some trick to making them edible he keeps closely guarded.\n\nMaybe you could pilfer his secret recipe for me?"
"3952276-1-7404";"The madness that erodes their minds seems to grant frightening power to their mechanical bodies. I can no longer keep them calm and stable, nor do I have the power to overcome them, should they escape this sanctum.\n\nI pray Seht will grant an answer."
"3952276-1-7411";"<It looks like the brassilisk emerged from the nearby pipeline, which likely leads to the Brass Fortress.>"
"3952276-1-7413";"Ask some questions. Determine the mood in Shimmerene and see how the newcomers are faring.\n\nRumors have reached the Queen and she is concerned. So Razum-dar comes to see what is happening and fights strange creatures. Now Raz is concerned as well."
"3952276-1-7424";"The Court's honor is at stake! They treat us like lowly pigeons even though we are sleek and beautiful. Well, let us show them dirty!\n\nBring me their tools of grooming and cleaning, then we'll see how they like it when their feathers turn dull."
"3952276-1-7425";"Only what's right. If the featherless curs won't share, then the Court will teach them some manners!\n\nBring me their toys and their games, their frivolous trinkets. Then the Court will bask in leisure while they become bored to tears."
"3952276-1-7426";"I opened a portal, but I can't recall where it went. Something intentionally blocked the destination from my sight. I entered the portal and time passed. Then I was back in the cave and the Heart was gone.\n\nWill you accompany me to the Dreaming Cave?"
"3952276-1-7427";"Your hands, crow-friend! Our wings lack such ugly but useful appendages!\n\nNow listen well. Plunder armor of the heaviest sort. Robust pieces that make a statement! Impractical things, but pretty when polished and shined. Yes, bring such items to me!"
"3952276-1-7428";"I knew the Court could count on you! You always were my favorite of all the featherless curs.\n\nI'm feeling bold! Brazen, even. I desire ornate and heavy armor from far off lands. Bring me these things and I'll reward you in kind."
"3952276-1-7430";"He's a pacifist, for Mara's sake!\n\nThe Sapiarchs' investigation was a joke. They just took Emile at his word and handed down the sentence. Of course, the local Guild Magister rolled over like she always does. Coward. Please, I need your help."
"3952276-1-7432";"We're about to enter a crucial stage of the augury ritual, so none of us can leave this chamber. If you could find my acolyte, Oriandra, she'll provide you with the amplification elixir we require.\n\nShe's in Sotha Sil's study, upstairs."
"3952276-1-7433";"I suspect that the language is ancient. It may actually predate the languages of Tamriel. I feel that the memory is connected to the barrier in the Dreaming Cave and where I hid the Heart.\n\nMy friend, we need to discover the meaning of these words."
"3952276-1-7434";"I fear he's already signed up, and that's why I require you as an ally. I'll need you to infiltrate the acting troupe. Larydel—my brother—knows my face, but he does not know yours. \n\nYou must find him for me so I can talk him out of this!"
"3952276-1-7435";"It drove my classmates mad! They were all quite sane before, but now they seem possessed by characters from novels and storybooks. They're snorting like pigs, running from cats … it's lunacy!\n\nI have some ideas on how to fix this, but I need help."
"3952276-1-7436";"No. He vanished! They say he escaped. Can you believe it? Why would he turn himself in only to escape a few hours later? They're hiding something, I know it!\n\nPlease, ceruval, help me find my boy. He would never hurt anyone, I swear it!"
"3952276-1-7437";"We don't exactly see eye-to-eye when it comes to hunting baddies. So now they're going to spend weeks questioning soldiers and measuring footprints while more people get turned to jerky.\n\nActually, maybe you could help me with that?"
"3952276-1-7438";"Some folk say she was an innocent girl, buried alive by an evil sister. Others say she was a necromancer, put to the sword. Who knows?\n\nIf you manage to run her off, you'll be doing all of Summerset a favor. Just don't expect us to go in after you."
"3952276-1-7439";"Travelers become lost, sometimes for days. From what I heard, the forest appears to … shift as you move through it. We'll need to keep close together.\n\nSo? Want to help me unlock an ancient mystery? I must say, I do pay well."
"3952276-1-7441";"Andewen should have known better. An Altmer fights for glory, not coin. Crawling through the muck, just to find some insignificant little temple? Simply outrageous.\n\nSo, are we agreed? You'll take this off my hands?"
"3952276-1-7442";"Lotus has only ever known kindness. Gentle as a lamb. I hand reared her from birth.\n\nShe fled in the chaos, but she won't make it on her own. I have to find Lotus before she's hurt … or worse."
"3952276-1-7446";"We also need to convince Sotha Sil to share the news he brought with us. But without the Ritemaster, he may decide to simply depart. Like all the members of the Dark Elf Tribunal, he can be very enigmatic.\n\nMaybe you should talk to him."
"3952276-1-7447";"Both decided to return? I'm surprised. Meridia's knight has a stake in this, but why would Leythen volunteer to return? It makes no sense.\n\nWell, go and talk to Sotha Sil. Perhaps he can shed light on what we can expect in the Crystal Tower."
"3952276-1-7448";"Good question. I found this memory stone in the grand reliquary. It's called the Eye of Remembrance. Using it near the library pedestals here might show us why these ruins were sealed.\n\nYou look stronger than most. How about you lend me a hand?"
"3952276-1-7450";"I need someone to improve the reputation of my properties. A hero type who people look up to. And I have a feeling about you. You've done something great, and are probably on the way to do something greater.\n\nSeems like we can help each other here."
"3952276-1-7451";"Reagents! Ingredients! Naturally, of course. I require that you gather the supplies needed to make the vivid paint this masterwork requires.\n\nJust take this list. Oh, and this tea of course. You'll need it to acquire the first item. Now, hurry along."
"3952276-1-7454";"It's no natural formation. The Sea Elves are conjuring it. If I could get within striking distance of their Sea Mage, I could break his hold on the storm and prevent the destruction to come … but that's a desperate hope for one Mer."
"3952276-1-7457";"Meet me in the main gallery. We can consult with the rest of the Conclave and use the scrying pool to continue our probe of the pearl.\n\nAs much as this situation concerns me, I must admit, I somewhat enjoy being in the middle of the action again."
"3952276-1-7460";"You would take on the duties of the admanen, the listening eye. An auspicious role! The admanen serves as the fulcrum, balancing competing theories. They also collect evidence, interview suspects, and the like.\n\nWhat do you say?"
"3952276-1-7461";"Exactly so! And you'll be the one to help us collect them again, hopefully before anyone comes to harm. Why, these items could cause all sorts of mischief.\n\nFirst though, let's have you read the Psijic Codex. That should help bring you up to speed."
"3952276-1-7463";"Well, she's certainly missing, and I'm not risking my scaly hide going in to find her. \n\nHmm. You look scrappy enough. If you can grab those tokens and what's left of my apprentice, I'll make it worth your while. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-7465";"High Elves who were cast out from their families as children. A horrible fate in our society.\n\nSummerset may appear as perfect as a pastoral painting, but darkness lies backstage. I want to face our taboos without blinking. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-7466";"In truth, I only wish to attend to check on Tableau. Her invitation came with a note, outlining concerns for her safety. \n\nCould you perhaps … go in and check on her? Make sure things run smoothly? It would mean a good deal to me if you would."
"3952276-1-7467";"These tall, skinny Elves, they have so many rules! Did you know Queen Ayrenn isn't even on Summerset? And to get an audience with her Proxy Queen requires some sort of proper introduction.\n\nVindilween won't let me set foot in the palace without one."
"3952276-1-7468";"I sent Valsirenn to Lillandril, where the College of Sapiarchs is located, to scout the area and see if the Court of Bedlam has made any moves against them.\n\nI need you to travel to Alinor to secure the Proxy Queen's permission to enter the College."
"3952276-1-7469";"They're research for Mehdze's recital at the Illumination Academy. I've been transcribing them for weeks.\n\nThe Goblins tossed them all over—not big readers, I guess—but this tribe is bigger than I thought."
"3952276-1-7471";"The item we were ordered to transport. It's tied to the yaghra, mysterious creatures that keep attacking our shores. \n\nWe have no idea what devastation the pearl's capable of, but we can't allow it to be used to dark ends. It must be destroyed."
"3952276-1-7472";"They've stood quiet for decades. But now? New, yawning sinkholes. Eerie sounds at night. I don't jump at shadows, but missing people? That's a warning I can heed. \n\nIf you head down there, take a look around for our friends. Will you?"
"3952276-1-7473";"Certainly not risk my life, if that's what you're implying.\n\nYou know, you have the look of a ruffian. Want to take on the task? If you collect Niralin, or at least what's left of her, I'll make sure you're paid handsomely."
"3952276-1-7478";"I'm probably over-concerned. The weather's been fair and the winds mild. Perhaps their fishing has been so fruitful they dare not waste their good fortune, but I'd feel better if I knew what to make of their delay."
"3952276-1-7479";"Destroy the Maormer's supplies, gathered along the shore. Rescue any citizen you find captured. And free Sunnawel, a gryphon, from capture. She's not only the city's symbol, she's also the best weapon we have at our disposal.\n\nWill you help?"
"3952276-1-7481";"How in Oblivion would I know? These Elves have rules for everything—how to eat, how to sleep …. Of course they've got rules about how to beat each other up.\n\nSay, you wouldn't be interested in helping me figure this out would you?"
"3952276-1-7484";"No. They're assuredly dead. King's Haven Pass is very dangerous, teeming with Goblins and gryphons, but the cult considers the pilgrimage a test of faith. \n\nRecovering their articles would be viewed favorably by the religious authorities."
"3952276-1-7485";"We've already seen the devastation that's possible when the tower falls into the wrong hands. And the recent attack by Nocturnal only reinforces the need for greater protection.\n\nI want you there to help plead our case. Will you join us?"
"3952276-1-7486";"Defeating a Dragon Priest is no small feat, but why not challenge yourself a little more?\n\nOnce you've dealt with the petty creatures and cultists, invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle to call forth Zaan the Scalecaller in all her terrible might."
"3952276-1-7487";"Sounds like Orryn the Black is summoning something nasty. I say let him. Better yet, read his notes and help make it the meanest stack of bones to take up walking. Then grind them both to dust.\n\nThat'll prove who's the real Undaunted here."
"3952276-1-7488";"We've gotten some troubling reports of the Daedra creating cocoons. There's dozens of them now, spreading throughout the cave. We need you to destroy them.\n\nOh, and burn any sacrilegious text you find. No need for that material to remain."
"3952276-1-7489";"I'm afraid that Archon's Grove has been recently taken over by a pack of werewolves. Most dreadful, but the Divine Prosecution cannot reassign resources to manage the outbreak. You'll have to go in alone.\n\nAre you willing to take on this assignment?"
"3952276-1-7490";"They've stolen many valuable relics, and we need you to recover them.\n \nWe also wish to keep tabs on their movements. I suspect most of the Sagacians have written plans on their person. Collect those plans using any means necessary."
"3952276-1-7491";"Yes, indeed! The Sea Elves regularly goad their nasty pets into our water ways. If left unchecked they'll devastate the local fauna and move on to do it all again.\n\nWe need to root out these nests before the vipers spread to the mainland coast."
"3952276-1-7492";"No, no. A colleague of mine, Esulo, has already seen to that. He just needs some help ensuring the books are safely removed from Summerset.\n\nYou'll find him in Golden Gryphon—at the bar, no doubt."
"3952276-1-7494";"Renzir's most precious treasure is his wife, sweet Nubani. Last he saw, she was near our ship. This one suspects she has cleverly hidden herself, but will need help to escape.\n\nDo all this, and Renzir will make sure you are rewarded."
"3952276-1-7497";"I sent a group of adventurers and a squad of marines to investigate the Sea Sload threat. After an initial report about a promising lead, they sent no further word.\n\nCainar, Grog, and Miriya seem capable enough, but their silence has me concerned."
"3952276-1-7498";"I can tell you that the Battlereeve sent three adventurers and a squad of marines to determine the extent of the problem. After an initial report, contact with the group was lost.\n\nWhat the Battlereeve will ask of you, well, that's for her to impart."
"3952276-1-7499";"I sent a group of adventurers and a squad of marines to investigate the threat. They reported in. Said they were exploring a promising lead. That was the last I heard.\n\nCainar, Grog, and Miriya seem capable enough, but I'm concerned for their safety."
"3952276-1-7500";"You would have words with that thin-legged sorcerer? Fine! You will find him in the courtyard of the gaudy Elf-Hall up the hill.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have an adventure to return to!"
"3952276-1-7502";"""To redeem this voucher and receive your special cake, look for the chef and his bakery barge in the ports of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, and the Harbor District of Daggerfall. We guarantee it will be delicious!"""
"3952276-1-7503";"Destroy the geysers. Find them and obliterate them as quickly as you can.\n\nYou'll need to fight through the creatures spawned by the geysers, so bring allies with you if you can. And make sure to destroy the pearls. That's the source of the magic."
"3952276-1-7508";"Eager to begin? Good. Eagerness is just what we need.\n\nYour first lesson begins now. The Order has detected a number of … irregularities on Tamriel. Small breaches in the fabric of time. I would like you to seal them for me."
"3952276-1-7510";"A member of the Mages Guild murdered a Sapiarch, but now the murderer's friend is railing against the conviction. Loudly.\n\nTalk some sense into her, would you? She might listen to another … guest. You'll find her outside the Fighters Guild."
"3952276-1-7511";"Let me attune you to my spell. There! Now we're connected through my mental link.\n\nFind the three adventurers, Cainar, Grog, and Miriya. When you examine them, the spell should take you into their individual mind traps. I can direct you from there."
"3952276-1-7512";"I'm not entirely sure. By Oblivion, I'm not even sure what day it is. The bottles must be somewhere along the winery grounds. I probably dropped them as we went along. \n\nI can barely see straight right now. Could you fetch them for me?"
"3952276-1-7515";"While I head inside to begin the augury ritual, I'd like you to go to Sotha Sil's study in the tower. Find my acolyte, Oriandra, and ask her for Sotha Sil's amplification elixir. We may need it if the pearl proves to be resistant to our magic."
"3952276-1-7516";"Not just a garden, the very art of gardening! Eslion is waging a war on Altmer horticulture. I represent everything he despises, so he's targeting my work. He's gone too far this time, planting stranglers to ward me away.\n\nThey could kill someone."
"3952276-1-7517";"Let me attune you to my spell. There! Now we're connected through the mental links.\n\nFind the three adventurers, Cainar, Grog, and Miriya. When you get close, the spell should send you into their individual mind traps. I can direct you from there."
"3952276-1-7519";"He's with Valsirenn, using the scrying pool to try to track down the missing pearl. If it's anywhere on Artaeum, the Ritemaster will find it. That's what the scrying pool is for.\n\nPlease, head into Ceporah Tower and see what the Ritemaster needs."
"3952276-1-7520";"Really? I have to warn you, the gryphons in there are quite nasty. They'd do anything to protect their nests from invaders.\n\nBut if you're willing, I'd be mighty grateful. Even pay you for your efforts!"
"3952276-1-7521";"Into the wilderness, off toward that old Wayshrine. How far could they have really gone?\n\nI would give anything to have my precious Eustasia safely in my arms again. Find her for me and I will make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-7522";"Yes. Take this map of the region, more Psijic Seals, and the Augur. I hope the breaches haven't grown more powerful.\n\nStay safe. And … just make sure Alik'r weathers this, all right? I know I shouldn't … I have to stay detached. Never mind."
"3952276-1-7526";"The Loremaster and I. While you made your way across Alik'r, we reached out with projections—looking for objects of power. We found one. The Staff of Towers.\n\nThe Loremaster's confident we can find it. You should speak with him when you return."
"3952276-1-7527";"Dead or imprisoned, depending on Vykosa's will.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give for a chance to strike back. This pack of curs needs to be taken down, before they can cause any more harm to the innocents of Tamriel."
"3952276-1-7529";"Vykosa is going to be your toughest opponent. Legends say she was turned into a werewolf by Hircine himself. A worthy adversary if I ever heard of one.\n\nEvoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle, and make your fight even more legendary."
"3952276-1-7530";"Well … yes, he is. My father transformed into a werewolf before he died. As such, his spirit is forced to remain within the Hunting Grounds.\n\nThe only way I can free my father's soul is to hunt down Tarcyr and win Hircine's favor."
"3952276-1-7532";"Hircine revels in the brutal combat between his contestants. And the way I hear it, your greatest competition is the werewolf Balorgh.\n\nTaunt the Orc by burning his pack's banner, and show Hircine what you're truly made of."
"3952276-1-7533";"It might be worth talking to the Loremaster. He would never admit it, but I think something is bothering him. Something about the staff fragments."
"3952276-1-7535";"Ancestor of ours, Gjadil the Keel-Hauler, cached her loot around here.\n\nIf you grab the chest for us, there's no chance for a sneak attack. The map over there will lead you right to it. And, obviously, I'll pay you for the trouble."
"3952276-1-7537";"An order of Summerset knights, which I'm honored to be a part of.\n\nZ'Maja was able to capture and somehow replicate my three companions. Even if fought alone, these shadows will be difficult to defeat. Do you think yourself capable of such a task?"
"3952276-1-7540";"Yes, I'm afraid I do. Could you travel to Cloudrest and seek out my mother, Belarin?\n\nI must warn you though, should my dreams be true, such a journey may come at great risk. You'll want to gather many allies by your side before heading off."
"3952276-1-7541";"Please, just take a moment and discuss this matter of the staff with Josajeh. I fear that she still resents my decision to lock the fragments away.\n\nShe suffered a … trauma. The promise of this staff could create an unwelcome distraction."
"3952276-1-7542";"We do. As always, the Augur, map, and Psijic Seals are prepared for your use. Josajeh will provide them.\n\nReturn to me once you have closed the breaches. We will solve this problem of the staff soon. You have my word."
"3952276-1-7543";"Yes. Precisely. \n\nJosajeh will provide the items you need. I was hesitant to give her this task at first. But keeping her involved to some degree seemed prudent … and perhaps humane? You should go speak with her. She needs friendly counsel."
"3952276-1-7544";"Pelin Graveyard in Bangkorai, Leki's Blade in Alik'r, the great Hist in Shadowfen, and the Fang Spires in Deshaan.\n\nOnce you arrive at a breach, activate the Augur and it should light a path to the artifacts. Josajeh can tell you more. Safe travels."
"3952276-1-7545";"You will no doubt find more time breaches near these landmarks. Once the Augur attunes to them, it should light a path to the hidden artifacts.\n\nYou must move quickly, initiate. Only the Psijic Order is prepared to deal with objects this dangerous."
"3952276-1-7546";"Not for long. A familiar place can serve as a temporal anchor. If she went to Divad's Chagrin, she almost certainly plans to use it as a springboard into an unfamiliar place … an unfamiliar time.\n\nTake the Augur and these seals and find this mine."
"3952276-1-7551";"Indeed. Until they find a suitable third investigator, the jurisreeves and revelators are left to sit on their hands. Nonsense.\n\nWhy not go lend them a hand? They'll likely just tell you to go jump into the sea, but it can't hurt to ask."
"3952276-1-7554";"Yes, I'm sure of it. I couldn't find them anywhere.\n\nI did meet a High Elf named Esterdel. He wouldn't tell me much, but he was definitely searching around the grove. He may know more about the situation than I do."
"3952276-1-7555";"The Ritemaster is in his study in Ceporah Tower. Go there and see what you can do to help him remember what happened."
"3952276-1-7558";"We also need to convince the Clockwork God to share the news he brought with us. But without the Ritemaster, he may simply take his leave. Like the other members of the Dark Elf Tribunal, he can be very enigmatic.\n\nPerhaps if you talked to him …."
"3952276-1-7559";"No. He thinks the language is ancient and he feels we need to determine what the memory means before we attempt to breach the barrier.\n\nThe Ritemaster is waiting for you in the Dreaming Cave. Go and talk to him as soon as you can."
"3952276-1-7560";"I'm sure the Ritemaster will provide more details, but I suppose it involves the augury spell he plans to cast upon the abyssal pearl that you and Valsirenn discovered.\n\nYou can find the Ritemaster in Ceporah Tower on Artaeum."
"3952276-1-7562";"The Goblins, ah, dragged her off. Along with all my notes too. I've been reciting every tale I know for inspiration on a valorous rescue, but I find them sorely lacking in the specifics.\n\nPlease help me. I'm lost without Naliara and my notes."
"3952276-1-7563";"Him and Valsirenn were going to try to use the scrying pool to track down the missing pearl. Please, return to Artaeum and go to Ceporah Tower. The Ritemaster was very insistent that I find you and send you there at the first opportunity."
"3952276-1-7564";"I don't have time to make polite conversation with the Proxy Queen. I need you to talk to Alwinarwe and secure her permission to enter the College of Sapiarchs. The Ritemaster has already requested an audience, so the Palace should be expecting you."
"3952276-1-7565";"I'd like you to make polite conversation with Proxy Queen Alwinarwe. Get her to give you permission to enter the College of Sapiarchs. The Ritemaster has already requested an audience, so the Palace should be expecting you."
"3952276-1-7566";"I don't have time to curry favor with Proxy Queen Alwinarwe. I need you to talk to the Proxy Queen and secure her permission to enter the College of Sapiarchs. The Ritemaster has already requested an audience, so the Palace will be expecting you."
"3952276-1-7568";"I'm sure the Ritemaster will provide details, though I can tell you it involves the augury spell he plans to cast upon the abyssal pearl that you and Valsirenn discovered.\n\nYou can find the Ritemaster in Ceporah Tower, in the main gallery."
"3952276-1-7569";"He and a few of the others have staked out a camp up on the ridge. He is foolish to stay. This place is cursed."
"3952276-1-7570";"Please don't tell anyone, but I think she stole a seeing stone called the Eye of Remembrance and took it to Traitor's Vault. \n\nI told her to put it back! The Relicmaster will be furious! I thought she'd seen reason, but when she missed breakfast …."
"3952276-1-7571";"Destroy the geysers. Find them and obliterate them as quickly as you can.\n\nYou'll need to fight through the creatures spawned by the geysers, so bring allies with you if you can. And make sure to destroy the pearls. That's the source of the magic."
"3952276-1-7572";"Well, yes. But the Relicmaster didn't seem too upset by the whole ordeal. He probably already saw how we were going to get them back. Maybe you have something to with that?\n\nJust go ahead into the College ruins over there. You can't miss him!"
"3952276-1-7599";"One and the same! Margus Derius. He's a looter of history who cares only about profit. He was a member of our society until he stole our research and disappeared.\n\nI need you to infiltrate the nearby Outlaws Refuge and find out what Margus is up to."
"3952276-1-7605";"Go to Bok-Xul and retrieve the stolen grave-stakes. Also, make sure to kill the necromancer Baxilt-Gah. \n\nThen take the grave-stakes and return them to swamp. Just place them where rot gas spews. That will set things right again."
"3952276-1-7606";"One of Murkmire's miregaunts. It's a huge, lumbering creature we call Walks-Like-Thunder. Very strong. Very dangerous.\n\nBest to kill it before you try to gather the vines."
"3952276-1-7607";"It is a huge, lumbering miregaunt called Walks-Like-Thunder. It guards the Echoing Hollow. Best to kill it before you gather the relics from the ancient ruins behind the Hollow.\n\nI have shared the location. Will you gather relics for the Naga-Kur?"
"3952276-1-7608";"I sigh at the innocence of outsiders. Killing plants isn't enough. You must burn the heart-roots!\n\nGo to Bok-Xul. Burn the corrupted heart-roots and kill the necromancer, Baxilt-Gah. Then the tribe will be safe. For a while."
"3952276-1-7609";"First, kill the necromancer. He is a blight upon the land. \n\nThen recover the bones of the fallen Dead-Water warriors. They need to be fashioned into weapons so they can be used in battles once again. Anything less would dishonor their memories."
"3952276-1-7610";"Enter the ruins and set fire to the supply caches! Also, kill the miregaunt that the stupid Blackguards awakened. Walks-Like-Thunder is too dangerous to live.\n\nDo these things for the Naga-Kur tribe and Bolu will reward you."
"3952276-1-7613";"""If you care about history and seek to correct the mistakes of the past, then Cyrodilic Collections wants you. Please look for <<1>> in Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, or Daggerfall. Help us beat the competition and preserve Argonian culture."""
"3952276-1-7614";"Yes. What blood she does not drink is spilled on the altars of the temple. For what purpose, I do not know, but many have died for the sake of her terrible rituals.\n\nShuxaltsei must be stopped."
"3952276-1-7615";"After my egg-relative joined them, the Legion vanished. At long last, I believe I know where they disappeared to—Tsofeer Cavern. However, the cavern is rumored to be the home of the Wuju-Ka. I can't face that monster on my own. Will you go with me?"
"3952276-1-7616";"Yes. You are clearly the best at what you do. I can think of no one more qualified to lead this endeavor.\n\nYou and Xukas have grown close, correct? He knows a great deal about the Remnant, I'm sure. Please, convince him we only want to help."
"3952276-1-7617";"We need to follow the trail. Whatever Margus found inside the idol, he's going to need Argonian experts to help him decipher it.\n\nTalk to Jee-Lar. He knows a few local Argonians with knowledge of Murkmire. That's who Margus will seek out as well."
"3952276-1-7619";"Jaxsik chases her prey into the Deepmire, northeast of here. It is an old-fear-place, beeko. No Saxhleel hunts there—not even the bravest kaals.\n\nThis will not stop Jaxsik. Naga fury makes her strong, but also reckless. She will need your help."
"3952276-1-7620";"I think they're right. Aside from the word of the Hist—which I've learned is very persuasive—legends say that the Vakka-Bok Xanmeer holds a great treasure. It has to be the Remnant!\n\nNow, we should get moving, right? We've got to stop Kassandra!"
"3952276-1-7621";"Go fetch … yes, go fetch Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn. I can only hold the Remnant. The three of you have a larger role to play. I'll explain when you get back.\n\nPlease, hurry. I … I can only bear the weight of it for a little while longer."
"3952276-1-7622";"To preserve it for future generations, of course! So much of the Argonians' unique history has been lost. With your help, we can pull this antiquity out of the mud and share it with the world!\n\nDiscovery! Adventure! What could be better?"
"3952276-1-7625";"You're catching on.\n\nIf you can get past the Blackguards and bring those texts back in one piece, there'll be a fair bit of gold in it for you."
"3952276-1-7626";"Imperial documents from that era were often written in code. See if you can also find a cypher ring or the scrolls will be worthless to Tia. Then bring whatever you find back to me."
"3952276-1-7627";"I will lend my expertise in all things Dwemer. In exchange, you act as escort for our expedition. You may take the lion's share of any valuables, but the items of historical significance are mine.\n\nIs that agreeable to you?"
"3952276-1-7629";"Word is this Dwarven vault is a death trap meant to keep what's there from ever seeing the light of day. I want you to raise the alarm before you face its guardian and smash your way through every last contraption those crafty bastards left behind."
"3952276-1-7630";"I believe that beneath the ruins of the Imperial fort here is an Ayleid city containing an artifact of enormous historical significance. Help me recover it and whatever treasures we find in Garlas Malatar are yours to keep.\n\nIt's a generous offer."
"3952276-1-7632";"Meridia loathes disorder. If slaughtering her Purified doesn't get her angry enough, burn the dictates on her altar before you beat some discord into her Symphony of Blades.\n\nNothing she hates more than free will and defiance."
"3952276-1-7633";"Armor. Specifically, Imperial armor from the First Era. According to Tia, the cavern should literally be filled with the stuff. Helmets, breastplates, whatever you can find. Then bring it back to me and I'll compensate you for your efforts."
"3952276-1-7634";"The elders stand by our traditions even as the tribe sinks into quicksand. They refuse to reach out for any aid that isn't prescribed by the tree-minder or the ka-deelith.\n\nPerhaps you could help Kishi? As an outsider, you aren't bound by our laws."
"3952276-1-7635";"She'll craft the curatives, but we need to provide the necessary components. Mindileth needs gloom morel mushrooms, a flask of barbleberry juice, and a few venom sacs from Scuttle Pit spiders.\n\nTake them to her at the Vineshade Lodge in Grahtwood."
"3952276-1-7636";"Visit the taverns in Mournhold, Stros M'Kai, and Vulkhel Guard. Post these handbills near the entrance to each.\n\nThe trick is getting people to notice. If you put on these dancing leathers and perform an Argonian reel, that will get some attention!"
"3952276-1-7637";"Tamira needs superior dreugh wax and ash basil leaves to create her candles. You can find both in Stonefalls.\n\nOnce you gather the items, deliver them to her workshop in Davon's Watch. Bring me a batch of her candles, and be quick-quick!"
"3952276-1-7638";"Kind of you to offer … I guess that'd be all right, since you're not an envoy from the local tribes. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nYou'll want to speak to our tree-minder, Pavu. She'll know what to do, and give you a proper welcome."
"3952276-1-7639";"Most assuredly so. It is our most important ceremony of the year. The whole village will be bubbling with activity to ensure it goes smoothly. Knowing that I will return soon with supplies would be one less burden on the tree-minder's mind."
"3952276-1-7640";"Long years of bitter disappointment have trained me to measure my expectations. We will find something in the grove, I am certain of it. But this dream-wallow business ….\n\nThe Hist will not make this easy. Not for you, and certainly not for me."
"3952276-1-7641";"Just so. I made contact with a reputable salt-maker—a Nord named Hervod—who can meet our demand, but he's no butcher. He did mention that the mammoth are plentiful in The Rift this season. \n\nPerhaps you could travel there and collect both for us?"
"3952276-1-7642";"Priestess Hodyette. They say that the goddess Kyne has blessed her with the ability to see the patterns of storms, days before they arrive. \n\nTravel to Priestess Hodyette's camp in Eastmarch and implore her to help our cause."
"3952276-1-7644";"A copper-tongued skink! It's a lizard, you see? Specially trained to sniff out and eat any foods that explorers ought to avoid. Can you get one for me?\n\nA trapper named Arlowe Viducia should have some for sale. You can find him in Sentinel."
"3952276-1-7645";"A local Argonian tribe has a tradition. To cleanse an area of evil influences, they place sacred candles beside unburied remains. Tia wants us to enter Tsofeer Cavern and place the candles next to any Imperial remains we find. And by we, I mean you."
"3952276-1-7646";"The instrument of my people! For many Argonians, the dulcet croaks of a vossa-satl remind them of the sounds of home.\n\nAct as my envoy and bring this opportunity to Captain Jimila. Help me secure a trade agreement and I will compensate you."
"3952276-1-7649";"A legend. Some say it's a massive gem. Others a magical egg. Either way, I fear Eshraf and Dinia's disappearance is linked to their search.\n\nXukas agreed to look into it, and it seems he's found something. Could you speak with him?"
"3952276-1-7651";"Unlike most of the old ruins around here, the Teeth of Sithis site was still being used. Not for its original purpose—more like a museum of ancient Argonian faith—but the ritual objects there are in better condition than we'll ever see again."
"3952276-1-7652";"No, no, no. This is archeological. Besides, the bones you'll be looking for didn't get a proper burial anyway. Don't worry about that.\n\nWhat ought to concern you are the Blackguards that took the place over. Criminal scum. Best poke around quickly."
"3952276-1-7653";"I've struck a deal with Drakeeh, the leader of the Blackguards. If I can defeat their gauntlet challenge, he'll release Seeks. Unfortunately, I'm more of a sneak than a fighter.\n\nBut you! I bet you've got combat skills aplenty. Mind helping me out?"
"3952276-1-7654";"That's the sting. The thief left behind a book of riddles, describing each tablet's location. \n\nHowever, I must admit that I am … unfamiliar with much of Murkmire. It took me days to piece together the first tablet's location."
"3952276-1-7655";"Paraxeeh travels among the tribes, spreading the dark word. Last I heard, he was headed to the Bright-Throat Village. You'll most likely find him there.\n\nAnd please, do not mention the theft. I'd rather my mentor not learn of my incompetence."
"3952276-1-7656";"That's the sting. The thief left behind a book of riddles, describing each tablet's location. \n\nHowever, I must admit that I am … unfamiliar with much of Murkmire. It took me days to piece together the first tablet's location."
"3952276-1-7660";"Varona saw some ancient Argonian stonework out in the swamp. She loves to study the techniques of long-dead masons.\n\nUse this whistle and Drooler should come running. If you pet him and tell him he's a good boy, he'll lead you directly to Varona."
"3952276-1-7661";"Ah, well, if you don't mind. To introduce the issue, if nothing else.\n\nThe dispute is between Nurhei and Paheiza, who both claim rights to a nearby saltrice farm. They've already both agreed to accept Sulahkeesh's decision."
"3952276-1-7662";"I'd not ask this of you if it wasn't a matter of grave importance. The box contains a memento from my village that I simply cannot lose.\n\nWill you help?"
"3952276-1-7663";"Then it is a warning to many. Our Root-Heralds held a moot with our allies and learned that Danlai was not the only Saxhleel to suffer this fate.\n\nXukas says you are one to be trusted. Would you please help prevent this from happening again?"
"3952276-1-7664";"You must travel to echoes of our past: Tsofeer Cavern, the Teeth of Sithis, and the Tomb of Many Spears. There, you will gather pieces from our Days of Stone-Nests.\n\nWhen all is collected, then I shall create."
"3952276-1-7666";"You can help make my sap-dreams a reality! Everyone knows the comfort of being lulled to sleep by the bubbling bog and croaking of frogs, but there's so much more to the music of the swamp!\n\nWe just need to assemble a quartet of swamp jellies!"
"3952276-1-7667";"I'll have you know I paid a lot for that information! But Stibbons is exceedingly slow and requires constant supervision. Why, I can't even spare a moment to look for the hand-mirror he lost.\n\nWould you mind ever so much finding it for me, please?"
"3952276-1-7668";"These past weeks the Hist has been agitated. It has given me signs that I believed were warnings for the bonding to come, but now I feel that I've misinterpreted.\n\nIt is this clutch that is in peril … and it is you who can save it."
"3952276-1-7670";"Though it grows abundantly, the aloe is surrounded by creatures most dreadful. Even our greatest warriors balk to enter Vakka-Bok.\n\nBut you are Rootmender, Bringer of the Remnant. Surely you can help us?"
"3952276-1-7671";"Our village is new and our supplies are low. If we are to be self-sufficient, we must quickly create farmsteads to sustain us. Such fertilizer is vital to ensuring this.\n\nWill you help us, Rootmender?"
"3952276-1-7672";"I have no doubt it was the Blackguards. We've already had a few skirmishes with them, and they continue to attack our hunters. They probably saw our envoys as easy targets.\n\nWe need someone to search the Blackguard Caravan and rescue them."
"3952276-1-7673";"Though our envoy escaped, all of her possessions were taken by the Blackguards. If we fail to retrieve them, we risk disrespecting the very tribes who have already offered their help.\n\nWill you aid us, Rootmender?"
"3952276-1-7674";"Flying lizards that fill the skies and attack our tribes. I've heard the Dark Elves liken them to cliff striders. Their hide happen to make excellent leather, despite the dangers in hunting them down.\n\nWill you aid us in this task?"
"3952276-1-7677";"Hist knows, we have been gracious hosts to the suitors of our neighboring tribes—plying them with feasts and phlegmwine—but now that it's time to renew vows of kinship, they're limp as wilting lilies when they should be rising to the occasion!"
"3952276-1-7679";"""If you care about history and seek to correct the mistakes of the past, then Cyrodilic Collections wants you. Please look for <<1>> in Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, or Daggerfall. Help us beat the competition and preserve Argonian culture."""
"3952276-1-7681";"Not according to the official record. The Imperials built a fort here around three hundred years ago, but it was lost to some unspoken calamity and abandoned. Unofficially, an item of similar description was unearthed here not long before then."
"3952276-1-7683";"Then what are you doing here? Famia will not last long without your help, new blood! And if she dies, who will Zadaza work for and make fun of?\n\nYou should go find her, yes?"
"3952276-1-7686";"Could they be interested in the Moon Gate of Anequina? It lies in that direction.\n\nI wonder if this pertains to Euraxia's final order? A soldier mentioned it after we captured her, but she refused to elaborate. Maybe you can help Tharn find out more."
"3952276-1-7688";"Simply put, I just acquired two halves of an ancient tablet. The Wrathstone. It forms a map that will lead us to a weapon capable of forcing all sides to cease their aggressive behavior.\n\nHelp me find this weapon and we can end the war."
"3952276-1-7690";"Forgive me, but I can't duplicate his imperious inflections. Ahem. ""The great Abnur Tharn requires your assistance. With it, we can end the Three Banners War. Report to me immediately if not sooner.""\n\nHe asked me to mark his location on your map."
"3952276-1-7691";"Still inside! A Daedroth caught us sniffing around, right? Hadaz tried to tell it that joke he knows. To make friends, yes? Doubt it worked, but who knows. This one took off running.\n\nI feel a little bad about leaving Hadaz. Would you look for him?"
"3952276-1-7692";"We care for many rare animals. A juicy target, yes?\n\nJust yesterday, a group of them stole this one's training whistle. To lure out our beasts, you see? We have little gold, but Numaia would pay you to retrieve her whistle and punish those muskarses!"
"3952276-1-7693";"I would need to first create an antidote. However, I require samples from corpses that have absorbed the fumes.\n\nNo easy task, given that something has awoken Cicatrice's dead. They now guard the ruins from any invaders."
"3952276-1-7694";"No. And we never will if Silhu-jo gets his way. He yowls about the risks, but Vazbi is not the saucer-eyed kitten she was when Silhu-jo found her. This one must fix this!\n\nYou're a warrior, yes? Would you escort Vazbi to investigate the aqueduct?"
"3952276-1-7695";"Don't know. Old stones, old gates and levers. Who can say for sure?\n\nI overheard the adepts discussing the trouble. A young one, Vazbi, seems keen to solve the issue. If you want to know more, she's the person to ask."
"3952276-1-7696";"Who said anything about a direct assault? Subterfuge is called for. I suggest a small group. Slip into the palace, locate Euraxia, and remove her from the throne—by any means necessary.\n\nTalk to Gharesh-ri. He knows someone who can get us inside."
"3952276-1-7697";"Cadwell's visions strike more frequently now. With more urgency. Tharn believes Zumog Phoom is close to reassembling Cadwell's dismembered body. I want you to stop him.\n\nThe Betrayer of legend must not be reborn."
"3952276-1-7698";"Half-sister. And I have no hesitation in this regard.\n\nTo best Euraxia, however, we need to reach the Halls of Colossus ahead of her. Give me and Khamira a moment to negotiate an accord we can both live with. Then meet us by the wagon I chartered."
"3952276-1-7699";"It's a personal matter, pertaining to my grandfather's legacy. Painful as it is to say, my family's reputation depends on proving this rumor false.\n\nYou wouldn't happen to be looking for work, would you? I could use a lending hand."
"3952276-1-7700";"Ha. To take from Khasda is no crime. His predecessor, Dashing Dasalzo, amassed the coin. Khasda only wallows in it, like a pig in its filth. A cruel, stupid pig.\n\nNow he lets the Stitches shuffle to ruin. This is his just punishment."
"3952276-1-7701";"No friend of Khasda's, this one can tell you. She's recruiting for a job, or so the rumors say.\n\nThis one doubts she'll have much luck convincing someone local to make an enemy of Khasda, but someone passing through …."
"3952276-1-7703";"She tells the priests to burn their moon-sugar, so they do. She tells them to smear cheese upon the walls, so they do. She tells them to douse the temple fires with their tongues, so they do!\n\nI fear someone will die if this continues!"
"3952276-1-7704";"Correct. This one searches for Zinthia, daughter of Ishu.\n\nHowever, Mizzik's inquiries have led to nothing but dead ends. And with a young lady's safety on the line, the sooner this investigation is solved the better."
"3952276-1-7705";"Spirit may not be correct. Entity. Goddess, perhaps. The one who protects the tomb while wrapping her arms around Kiseravi's mind.\n\nWill you retrieve the Akaviri relics? Otherwise, their secrets will be trapped here forever. Along with Kiseravi."
"3952276-1-7706";"Ha! Compared to vigorous Sarazi, you are a dry twig!\n\nThis calls for a contest! Hunting beasts is one thing. Hunting hunters, though? That is a real test. Three savage Khajiit hunt any person who enters the Mesa. Whoever kills them all first wins!"
"3952276-1-7707";"Oh, a vicious beast, with ravening jaws and beady black eyes! The Breton Tahara bought it from called the creature Burtle, but do not let its silly name fool you.\n\nYou seem capable. If you find Burtle, I will gladly share some of my profits with you."
"3952276-1-7710";"My blood-brother, Rakazsa, tempts my clan to give in to their thirst. He urges them to abandon our way of life and prey on the caravanners without restraint, or mercy.\n\nI must divert them from this path, but I am losing the fight."
"3952276-1-7711";"That would be most appreciated. This one is sure you'll find the key nearby.\n\nAh, and if you could recover Mazdurr's amulet of Azurah as well? The bandit's leader, Zayreba Sharpclaw, seemed to admire it greatly. It will likely be by her side."
"3952276-1-7712";"You must slay a Daedra and store its soul in an empty soul gem. \n\nZahari has collected many empty gems for just this purpose. Use them well. Once you return, our enchanters will imbue our weapons with their power."
"3952276-1-7713";"Yes, into exactly sixteen pieces. My brother and I found and restored each and every one. And then, just as we were about to put all the pieces together again, they were stolen!\n\nOh, who would even do such a thing?"
"3952276-1-7714";"I'll admit, I've never been sure of how it plays the song. Perhaps through an enchantment?\n\nI can't help but feel that we're missing something here. Something that wouldn't be clear until the mural was restored once more."
"3952276-1-7716";"Yes, maybe you can.\n\nI find myself having difficulty focusing. If the force that reanimates these corpses exerts pressure on the mind as well … that would be profoundly unsettling. I intend to search these ruins for answers. Will you join me?"
"3952276-1-7717";"Yes. Probably. Memories run deep in places like this, and where there are memories, there are spirits. Helpful ones, I hope. With any luck, one of them will answer our questions.\n\nNow, it's a long climb to the temple summit. Are you prepared?"
"3952276-1-7718";"Hmm. Something about the enchantment—it's purposeful. Its strength seems tied to your new friend's will to serve. Fighting the undead with the sword near to hand might be enough to restore it.\n\nWe'll need it fully charged to defeat Arum-Khal."
"3952276-1-7719";"Hmm. You ask a lot of questions, yes? Mother just told me to stand here and find more farmhands. So I did.\n\nYou have questions? Talk to Mother at our farm. Her name is Kideya, though you should call her ma'am. That is only polite, yes?"
"3952276-1-7721";"You mean to help? Well, I guess there's no harm in delegating. According to my research, a powerful wizard named Marzula-jo used this place as his laboratory. If you find his notes and any memory stones he might have left behind, I would be indebted."
"3952276-1-7723";"That is just it. I have no idea. Moons, my head pounds! The effort I exerted at Jode's Core was not without … a cost.\n\nFive-claw, could I convince you to determine the fate of my soldiers and our friends?"
"3952276-1-7725";"We merely wish for our recruits to observe your fighting techniques. Teaching through demonstration is most effective, yes?\n\nMeet Captain Shideya at the Kulati Mines in Alik'r and show our soldiers a thing or two about fighting spiders."
"3952276-1-7731";"Wait, does that mean you're in? Really? Z'en's price, that's good to hear.\n\nI work on a ranch east of here, just past the ridgeline. Talk to the owner, Numaia. She'll give you all the details and get you sorted. Thanks again, friend!"
"3952276-1-7734";"Stay focused. We can deal with that later. Right now, we must assist the Defense Force. We'll rendezvous at their command post.\n\nOn your way, however, I have another task for you. I detected several surges of power that I want you to investigate."
"3952276-1-7737";"Zamarak wants to help the Khajiiti Defense Force, but he has something he needs to check on first. But you, walker. Your aid would be immeasurable.\n\nFind Abnur Tharn in Riverhold. Offer your assistance against the Dragons."
"3952276-1-7741";"Consider it obfuscation to hide your true purpose. We don't want to give Euraxia a reason to react poorly to overtures of reconciliation. Not that I expect to reach an accord, but still.\n\nMeet me in Rimmen and we'll enter the palace together."
"3952276-1-7742";"They're willing to pay a reward for it's safe return.\n\nWhat do you say? Will you help."
"3952276-1-7744";"He is closer to the ruins, tending to one of our companions.\n\nSpeak to him to learn more. Ah, he is the green one with many scales. Hard to miss in a land of few Argonians, no?"
"3952276-1-7745";"Allow our recruits to observe you in combat. Zahari has found that such demonstrations are far more effective than mere speeches.\n\nMeet Captain Shideya at Cath Bedraud in Glenumbra, and teach our soldiers how to fight skeletons."
"3952276-1-7746";"Allow our recruits to observe your techniques. Through such an observation, Zahari believes that much can be learned.\n\nMeet Captain Shideya at the Stonechewer Camp in Stormhaven, and show our soldiers how to fight against Goblins."
"3952276-1-7747";"Zahari suggests an observation, rather than a lesson. We ask that you show our recruits your fighting techniques.\n\nMeet Captain Shideya at Rootwater Grove in Greenshade, and show our soldiers how to best fight against lurchers."
"3952276-1-7748";"Allow our recruits to observe your combat techniques. Through such observation, Zahari believes much will be learned.\n\nMeet Captain Shideya at Loriasel in Shadowfen and show our soldiers how to properly combat a lamia."
"3952276-1-7749";"Hidden within the icy tombs of Skyrim.\n\nYou must travel to Stormcrag Crypt, a Nord tomb in Eastmarch. Find the scroll, bring it back to Zahari, and our scholars will do the rest. Simple, no?"
"3952276-1-7750";"Icehammer Vault, a Nord tomb in Eastmarch. \n\nFind the scroll within its icy depths, and return to Zahari. She will then make sure it is sent to our scholars. After all, ancient Nord is not this one's first language."
"3952276-1-7751";"Travel to Shroud Hearth, a Nord tomb in the Rift. Search for the scroll hidden within its icy depths. The information it contains could very well turn the tide of battle."
"3952276-1-7753";"It's hubris to believe any vampire could tame the power in a Dragon's blood. It could kill him.\n\nI must get Grundwulf to see reason, but I can't do that with all these Hollowfangs in my way. I need a diversion. Perhaps you could help me with that?"
"3952276-1-7755";"Supposedly, those leeches brought down the Dragon with the help of a Dragonguard. Not one of those pretenders with hand-me-down equipment. The real deal.\n\nGive him a taste of Hollowfang blood-alchemy to get his heart thumping before you thump him."
"3952276-1-7756";"I have King Camoran's blessing to petition the nature spirit, Selene, to help us protect Valenwood from Maarselok's poison.\n\nIt's a gamble, but it's all we've got. Even that might not be enough …. I don't suppose you're the betting type?"
"3952276-1-7758";"The Dragon's lair is seething with the seeds of its corruption, like some kind of rotten nest. Give'em a swift kick and see if Maarselok comes after you like a swarm of angry hornets. At least Dragons don't sting, right?"
"3952276-1-7759";"Who is Alkosh? Gak! Riddle'Thar has kicked sand over the First Cat so long that his name is forgotten!\n\nAlkosh is the first divine: the Dragon King of Cats! Khajiit have strayed from him, but he's returned to right our path! Come, see for yourself!"
"3952276-1-7762";"No, walker, a god! The first of the Divine Litter. Alkosh! Maybe you know him by his other names? Akatosh, Dragon God of Time? Auri-El? All aspects of the First Cat.\n\nHave faith, when we reach Sunspire you will see I speak the truth!"
"3952276-1-7764";"Saviwa threw a big party. Everyone was having fun until a jeek bumped the urn, and woke my ancestor from the dead. Now, Saviwa needs to get the urn to our family tomb so he can rest, but warring cultists are blocking the way.\n\nYou will help, yes?"
"3952276-1-7765";"A Dwemer stronghold Quintus had been searching for before he died. I managed to discern its location using what I learned about the Wrathstone and Garlas Malatar. I believe the other half of the tablet is here. We just need to excavate it."
"3952276-1-7766";"The Combat Dragonhorn is charged, but we still do not know its full capabilities. We must not waste its energy, so we will save it until absolutely necessary.\n\nWe should make our way to the Moon Gate now. Tell our companions, it is time."
"3952276-1-7767";"Mad cultists who worship Merrunz, the Fire-Cat, took the cave for themselves. We might have been able to sneak around them, but now they summon huge Daedra by the pawful!\n\nIf you ruin these silly summoning rituals, Nisuzi will pay you handsomely."
"3952276-1-7769";"Gharesh-ri has placed the defense of the city in Khamira's hands. She moves the Desert Wind adepts, every volunteer she could muster, and what remains of the militia like pieces on a game board.\n\nReport to her and she'll give you your orders."
"3952276-1-7770";"I think the best tactic is to defeat the Dragons at their hunting grounds. When they eat, we can stop them. Permanently.\n\nWhat do you say? Are you willing to help?"
"3952276-1-7771";"This one wouldn't be Lord Gharesh-ri's best spy if she didn't listen at closed doors. The Usurper Queen marches on Riverhold. Tharn needs you to help defend the city.\n\nBut this one doesn't know these things and never said a word."
"3952276-1-7772";"Look for his belongings. He's always dropping things because of his numbing hand fungus. I would do it myself if it weren't for my responsibilities. If he's dead, someone has to carry on our sacred duties.\n\nWhat do you say? Will you rescue Marthine?"
"3952276-1-7773";"A good question, five-claw. This one doesn't think so, but what does Lyrrsazhi know about military engagements? We do have a new queen, though, so that is something.\n\nGo to Riverhold and talk to Tharn. He should be able to allay your concerns."
"3952276-1-7774";"Our friends in the adeptoriums treasure their scrolls. In sour times, these adepts hide our wagons—they give us shelter and warm food. It is only fair that we repay the favor, yes?\n\nPlease, snatch up some of these scrolls before the Euraxians do."
"3952276-1-7775";"Yes, magic trinkets! And Nisuzi knows just where to find them.\n\nSeek out the Abode of Ignominy—a collapsed temple, filled with undead. Whoever raised them left many charms behind. Bring back three, or so, and this one will be very grateful!"
"3952276-1-7776";"Great beasts stalk Predator Mesa. Kill them, then collect their blood in this vessel. Once you have the blood, smear it on ritual altars dedicated to Hircine near the center of the Rise.\n\nDo this, and the Hungry Cat will know we honor him."
"3952276-1-7777";"Some dungy wizard placed a hex on many of the relics. The spell draws minotaurs to the tomb. Minotaurs, walker!\n\nOur soothsayer created a magic yowling-powder to chase this enchantment away. We just need you to sprinkle it on the relics. Simple, yes?"
"3952276-1-7778";"Not just any tea! The Samar Pekoe! The finest tea in all of Tamriel.\n\nMmm. Such smooth, tanic flavor. Such a sweet, citrusy finish! The mouth waters at the very thought, yes? Pluck the finest, tenderest leaves, and Nisuzi will see you well-paid!"
"3952276-1-7781";"Of course, five-claw, of course! All the more reason to fear crossing the Purring Liar on the road. The Thief-God delights in stealing pride even more than riches.\n\nBetter to make a friend of Rajhin first by acquiring him an offering. Or three."
"3952276-1-7783";"How good of someone to finally notice!\n\nYes, this one hears things. Uneasiness surrounding a mysterious final order issued by Euraxia before she died. Not to mention the confusion regarding the Dragons and their pet necromancers. Dark Moons indeed!"
"3952276-1-7786";"""To redeem this voucher and receive your special cake, look for the chef and his bakery barge in the ports of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, and the Harbor District of Daggerfall. We guarantee it will be delicious!"""
"3952276-1-7787";"This one wouldn't be worth her moon-sugar as a spy if she didn't overhear a thing or two she wasn't supposed to. The great Tharn plans to meet with the Usurper Queen and he wants you to accompany him.\n\nBut you heard none of that from me."
"3952276-1-7788";"You imply Lyrrsazhi listens at closed doors? Oh, you know me so well, five-claw!\n\nThis one heard talk of the necromancer, Zumog Phoom. The queen fears he seeks to restore Cadwell the Betrayer, and she has no desire to see that dark legend reborn."
"3952276-1-7789";"So many ways! First, a courier brought Rigurt's package to Riverhold instead of Rimmen. Then, as our ship was boarding, a werebear attacked and stole honey needed for my special sweetbread. Last and not least, Rigurt's famous minstrels are missing!"
"3952276-1-7790";"Not with that attitude, it isn't. I can teach you a trick that will swing the war in your alliance's favor while bringing a smile to the ever-changing face of your favorite Daedric Prince.\n\nI'm talking about me, just in case that wasn't clear."
"3952276-1-7791";"He has a name, friend. His name is Gordon the Guar.\n\nHe ran off, and Hadamnargo has had no luck luring him back. Gordon and the horse are very close. They often spend hours just staring at each other. It's a bit strange, but Hadamnargo doesn't judge."
"3952276-1-7793";"Naw. The Khajiit don't usually call thieves pariahs, though. This <<1>> earned the name another way.\n\nTo be clear, if you don't find out, you still get paid. Interested?"
"3952276-1-7794";"Kill her, of course! We can only suffer so many humiliations at the hands of some muskarsed serpent woman.\n\nIf you best her, try to bring back a few mementos from the bodies of fallen challengers. It might be a comfort to their families, yes?"
"3952276-1-7795";"Well, the sugar traders tell me that a few of their camels are still alive. Wily Kee'va corralled them into Talon Gulch, you see? Intending to eat them later, no doubt.\n\nSet those camels loose, and I'll see that it's worth your while."
"3952276-1-7796";"Lyrrsazhi hears things. She considers it part of her duty to the throne.\n\nThere is talk of the Moons aligning, even though the time is wrong. And soldiers were sent to the ruins of the Moon Gate of Anequina. The queen will tell you more."
"3952276-1-7797";"Yes, in fact.\n\nA Goutfang adept smuggled these funeral urns out of the ruin. Wise of him, since dro-m'Athras can make puppets of the dead. But we should put them back once the Bent Cat is slain. Bad fortune to hold this sort of thing for long, yes?"
"3952276-1-7799";"Yes, rhook. Of course.\n\nNa'ruzz often buries unholy charms and totems around his lair to keep out adepts and the like. Find as many as you can, and dig them up. If you swing a shovel as well as you swing a weapon, this should be light work, yes?"
"3952276-1-7800";"Yes! Believe me, all of Northern Elsweyr will sing your praises. Those two have nearly choked the life out of honest trade.\n\nAlso, you'll probably find a pile of contraband in their lair. Skooma packed in crates, and such. Smash it to splinters!"
"3952276-1-7801";"A spy of Lyrrsazhi's caliber uncovers secrets. It is as natural as grooming!\n\nThis one thinks the queen worries about our missing soldiers. They have yet to return from the Moon Gate. But Lyrrsazhi isn't supposed to know about that, either."
"3952276-1-7802";"Yes, walker. Nothing is ever simple!\n\nMany cats lay buried in shallow graves at Scar's Edge, and with Thannar near, they grow restless. Take this quieting balm and pour it over their remains. The adepts tell me it should keep the corpses from rising."
"3952276-1-7804";"Well, Dragons need to eat, and when they find a source of food, we notice. Then I share their current hunting grounds with those interested in taking them down.\n\nIf you choose to help, I'd give you that information, plus a reward when you're done."
"3952276-1-7808";"A Khajiit woman—Cathay by the look of her. She wore the attire of a sorcerer, but then, I could put on a tin crown and claim I am an Emperor.\n\nShe strays there heedlessly or lingers with bad intentions. Either way, no good can come of it."
"3952276-1-7809";"I'm not hiding, I'm waiting. Thought I might sneak into camp at an opportune moment and get back what's mine, but I've been out here for nearly a day now.\n\nI should probably just get back to Riverhold before I pass out."
"3952276-1-7814";"He didn't elaborate on either topic. Just mentioned a threat to Southern Elsweyr. Between Tharn's cryptic letter and Nahfahlaar's strange mood, I'm feeling out of sorts.\n\nTalk to Nahfahlaar. Find out what troubles him while I prepare for Tharn."
"3952276-1-7815";"All Sai would say was that Abnur Tharn mentioned a threat to Southern Elsweyr. I could tell the letter troubled him, which makes me downright terrified.\n\nWill you go and meet with them?"
"3952276-1-7816";"I do. But I do not know where he hides. I leave that task to you, as the Dragonguard of old were known to be accomplished trackers.\n\nSeek the aid of a companion who knows this land well and let them guide you. Now go, hunter. Find Yahgrondu."
"3952276-1-7818";"In their tombs. I'll search one, you the other—using this Dragonguard seal.\n\nThe seal will activate three glyphs that will reveal the entrance to the tomb. Between the both of us, I pray we find the wisdom my student seeks. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-7819";"Dragons! The terrible beasts have returned to ravage the land of the Khajiit, but it won't be long before they endanger all of Tamriel.\n\nBlademaster Kasura sent me to find help. I found you."
"3952276-1-7820";"There is hope, but exorcising dro-m'Athra carries great risk. They will claw at this one to silence her song, or try to twist her tune until she too sways her tail to the Bent Dance. Cantors normally walk with a pride of sharp-claws to do this."
"3952276-1-7821";"As far as I know, this is the first time the Dragonguard has faced this particular obstacle.\n\nWe need to find a way to get up to that island and we need to do so quickly. Talk to Queen Khamira. Her portal magic may turn out to be our only option."
"3952276-1-7822";"Not since he flew off in a huff. Something about making sure the lesser Dragons didn't rally to Kaalgrontiid's side. We could use him, but I can see the wisdom in reducing the number of Dragons we need to deal with.\n\nWill you return to the sanctum?"
"3952276-1-7823";"Despite its age, the map included with the journal clearly shows where we must go. A dormant volcano in Southern Elsweyr.\n\nI ask you, friend, will you make this journey with me?"
"3952276-1-7824";"If there's cult activity in the city, Renmus should know something about it. I want you to see if he has any leads you can follow.\n\nAeliah's agreed to get you into the palace. No need to schedule another appointment."
"3952276-1-7826";"General Renmus, leader of Senchal's military forces, could commandeer a ship to sail us to the island. We need to arrange a meeting with the general and convince him to support us.\n\nWhat say you, warrior? Will you help me slay this Dragon?"
"3952276-1-7828";"Couldn't really tell from where I was sitting. Eyes aren't what as they used to be.\n\nThought I saw a Khajiit prowling around nearby, though. Might be a guard, or someone trying to pick the wreck clean. Either way, she probably knows what happened."
"3952276-1-7829";"Yes. Daini set them on the caravaners. Only to scare them! But the birds gobbled the guards up. Bad luck for them and for Daini. The goods I meant to steal are ruined!\n\nDaini can fix this. I just … I really need help. You will help, yes?"
"3952276-1-7830";"Upstairs, in his chamber. He seems … troubled about everything that happened.\n\nTalk to him. Find out what occurred on Dragonhold after we left."
"3952276-1-7833";"Journey to Senchal and speak with General Renmus. I don't expect him to join us in our fight, but he may have reports concerning Nahfahlaar and Laatvulon's battle."
"3952276-1-7834";"Brain them. Actually, brain them anyway. One less cultist to give us trouble. Take any messages you find and bring them to me. But be discreet. The Orcs in Malak's Maw aren't friendly. Less so if they're working with the New Moon now."
"3952276-1-7835";"Eh, sort of. Stormhaven seems to be full of them but we got no way to find them, except one. There was a group of bandits who used to run an operation out of Windridge Cave. Got a map that belonged to them pointing to an Akaviri grave. Find it."
"3952276-1-7836";"They scattered like skeevers after the theft. She has learned that their leader, Nishzo, has a hideout in a cave on the coast north of Senchal, but even if he is still there Bebbia couldn't confront him herself.\n\nShe can afford a bounty though."
"3952276-1-7837";"Yeah. Real charmers.\n\nThey planned to put us in some kind of exhibition. The kind you don't walk away from, I wager. I'm not going to miss that cart, but the other prisoners, Tajahir and Marekki, are good folk. I mean to rescue them. Want to help?"
"3952276-1-7841";"Should our shrines stay soiled, the sojourners who seek sanctification here will steep in soured skooma! Shazar shudders to surmise what sickness spawns from these suspect waters!\n\nIt must be expelled!"
"3952276-1-7842";"As I heard the tale, the journals spoke of the Dragon Vahlokzin, who stole the Horn of Ja'darri from the ancient Dragonguard. The blademaster plans to kill the Dragon and retrieve the horn.\n\nWith your help, of course. I prepared a horse for you."
"3952276-1-7843";"We were taking my uncle's gourmet moon-sugar to the market in Rimmen. We had just set up camp for the night when we were attacked. My cat, Winks, ran away. My guard, Maezi, chased after the thieves ….\n\nI love—I mean, I'm worried about them."
"3952276-1-7844";"Witches. The Icereach Coven. We drove them into the sea years ago—back to this accursed isle. But now they've returned, with a horde of Reachmen in tow.\n\nThey came down on us like an avalanche. If you mean to face them, please try to find my mates."
"3952276-1-7846";"Ha! I knew you came looking for a real challenge. Your funeral, I guess.\n\nWay I hear it, these witches really treasure their wicker totems and trinkets. Burn one of them up, and I bet the witches will give you a bloody good time."
"3952276-1-7847";"I do not know what they seek specifically, but this cavern contains vast piles of ash and bone—the remains of an unholy army called the Gray Host. A treasure trove for necromancers.\n\nPlease, wayfarer, can you help me drive these trespassers off?"
"3952276-1-7849";"Well, I'm no necromancer, but I hear that their rituals are anything but stable. If you find a totem of some kind and kick it over, you're sure to stir up some real trouble!"
"3952276-1-7850";"I … I don't know. I just can't shake the feeling that my mother has unfinished business in the citadel. Something to do with her necklace and that man.\n\nPerhaps you could take the necklace inside for me? It's the key to this mystery, I know it."
"3952276-1-7851";"Well, I'm sure I wouldn't know. This client prides himself on his erudition. I suppose he thinks he can open them? Makes little difference to me—I can't read Akaviri!\n\nI just need you to enter the Forsaken Citadel and gather up a few. What say you?"
"3952276-1-7853";"The Goutfangs are tight-lipped, but I poked around. <<1>> studied forbidden fighting techniques and now teaches them to students. Not sure what these techniques are, but I bet you find out if you fight them.\n\nInterested?"
"3952276-1-7854";"Ha. You're a funny one. <<1>> made off with everything, so draw your own conclusions. The quartermaster needs the rice to provision folk. And I don't want to stare down a plate of overly sweet Khajiiti food again.\n\nWill you do it? Pays well."
"3952276-1-7855";"In terms of pay, which is handsome, no. Consider it more of an efficiency. Besides, you can't collect the dust if you don't deal with the guardian.\n\nHit it a few extra times for me. That is, if you're interested."
"3952276-1-7856";"Something with lots of blades. Meridian, given that the temple's Meridian. Scholars … smart in some ways, not so much in others. Should've taken along skilled protectors.\n\nWill you kill the guardian and find the notes?"
"3952276-1-7857";"One with lots of sharp edges. Meridian temple, so I'd say Meridian guardian. And we all know that Meridia's not all sweetrolls and smiles.\n\nCan you kill the guardian and bring back some of those arrows? There's a reward in it for you."
"3952276-1-7860";"Rumor is, Ethruin's been looking to raise an army of giant skeletons from under an even more giant tree called the Barrowbough. Head to the Barrowbough in the Bone Orchard of Grahtwood and break up their parley by killing the New Moon ambassador."
"3952276-1-7861";"Names match a Dragonguard roster we got. Can't be that many Akaviri stuffed in the Corpse Garden, right? How about you see if those Dark Elves buried them with honors? Bring any Dragonguard relics you find back here."
"3952276-1-7862";"Don't it? From what I gathered, our Dragonguard scrollbearer went to Grahtwood. Left behind a letter in code. I'm guessing for folk like us to recover the scrolls when needed.\n\nHe hid them in the Hall of Might in the ruins of the Reliquary of Stars."
"3952276-1-7863";"My client insists that an old battlemage placed a hex on them. Now, before you object, Guybert knows a little something about curses! Handling these weapons is quite safe. Probably.\n\nPull a few from their resting places and we'll share the profits!"
"3952276-1-7864";"Burn, of course! Well, I hope so at any rate. I haven't tried them out. Moving on!\n\nThe herbs and enchantments contained in the wax should ease the burdens of restless spirits. That's what she told me, anyway. I guess we'll find out. Good luck, hero!"
"3952276-1-7865";"Some outfit called the Supernal Dreamers—whatever that means. Devotees of Vaermina. I hear they got a camp northwest of Koeglin Village.\n\nHead out and put the New Moon's recruiter to sleep for good. Bring any notes you find back with you."
"3952276-1-7866";"Track the beasts to their hunting grounds. There, they grow fat and lazy. In that moment of weakness, gather your allies and slay them. A simple task, but a grave one.\n\nThe Dragons must die, walker. Will you do this for the Dragonguard?"
"3952276-1-7867";"Track the beasts to their hunting grounds. There, they grow fat and lazy. In that moment of weakness, gather your allies and slay them. A simple task, but a grave one.\n\nThe Dragons must die, walker. Will you do this for the Dragonguard?"
"3952276-1-7868";"The client used to plant lilies there in her grandmother's memory. Alas, she's getting on in age, and the prospect of sneaking around piles of bloodthirsty smugglers no longer appeals.\n\nSo, I'd like you to take these lilies and plant them for her."
"3952276-1-7869";"Indeed! Simple as that.\n\nNow, please don't feel underutilized. That cove runneth over with smugglers, bandits, and other such scoundrels. So, if slaking a thirst for blood is a must for you, this cave provides ample opportunity! Good luck!"
"3952276-1-7870";"One of my clients is trying to develop a treatment, but she needs high-quality blood samples.\n\nSkooma addicts often gather in Moonlit Cove. I know it's macabre, but you could probably find a corpse or two worth examining there."
"3952276-1-7873";"The best stuff, I assure you! It contains—hey, nice try, but no way I'm going to reveal my secret recipe!\n\nUnfortunately, I seem to have misplaced my last three bottles of ingredients. Must have lost them while I was watching the sand-whales."
"3952276-1-7879";"We ran in different directions once the cultists started chasing us. I lost sight of them while fleeing for my life!\n\nI ducked under here and have been hiding ever since. Could you look for my friends, please?"
"3952276-1-7880";"I'm an herbalist. I prepare an herbal remedy that maintains the health of my customers. The faster it's delivered, the greater its medicinal value.\n\nGet my produce to the people on this list before it spoils and I'll throw in something extra."
"3952276-1-7888";"None to be found. Black Heights is a spotless community. You tell that to that cantor if you see her too. Any trouble followed her here."
"3952276-1-7890";"Sai Sahan seemed eager to talk to you and Nahfahlaar. I'd suggest you go to Nahfahlaar's Chamber and poke your nose in."
"3952276-1-7892";"Oh, I'll make you a list. There's all sorts of parts that are useful in alchemy and what have you.\n\nYou can start with something easy while I write this up. I need you to get me some Dragon spit."
"3952276-1-7894";"Help me track down the coven and figure out their ultimate plan. Between the two of us, we can cover more ground and determine the full extent of this threat.\n\nAs long as the magic provided by Jorunn's wizards works as promised, that is."
"3952276-1-7895";"Only that she's waiting for you in the city. At the Fighters Guild. Something to do with a plot that threatens not only Skyrim, but potentially all of Tamriel.\n\nWill you go talk to the Skald-King's agent?"
"3952276-1-7897";"If Vijari is not yet lost to the Great Darkness, then there is hope, but exorcising dro-m'Athra is risky, as you know. The Bent Cats will do all they can to silence Adara'hai's song or twist it to their tune.\n\nShe brought no sharp-claws on this trip."
"3952276-1-7901";"That might work against a mob of Reachmen, but thick walls can't stop a harrowstorm. Any war we try to wage will be over before it starts if we don't find a way to stop them.\n\nFenn knows more about the storms than anyone. See what he suggests."
"3952276-1-7902";"The princess said a lot of things. Mostly to the she-giant and the blood-sucker. Something about harrowstorms and the fences—no, defenses.\n\nLook, just go to the palace, all right?"
"3952276-1-7904";"If we just had some meat, we could last a few more days, I'm sure. I tried to kill a horker earlier but my hands were frozen and I dropped my hunting knife. \n\nPlease, my crew mates will starve to death if help doesn't come soon."
"3952276-1-7905";"Some livestock I could see. But this is unusual.\n\nNo doubt there's a drunken truth behind the story. Certainly not icy undead as Brun tells it. Would you care to look into it for me? I could pay you, obviously."
"3952276-1-7906";"I'm not sure, but it's not like Rasir to not to report back.\n\nMy partner, Skor, ran off to find him. I worry for him, too. He tends to think of others before himself. I want to search for them, but I'm too injured to go alone. I need an ally."
"3952276-1-7907";"That makes it even more imperative that he heeds your warning and takes action. All of the holds are in danger. Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, Karthald … my father needs to do something before another storm strikes.\n\nMeet me at the Blue Palace, all right?"
"3952276-1-7908";"Tempted to a desolate area in Eastmarch, most likely to be subjected to more of those strange rituals? If that doesn't scream danger, I don't know what does.\n\nWill you accompany me, my friend? I'd appreciate your help in this matter."
"3952276-1-7909";"He didn't elaborate on either subject. Just mentioned a threat to Southern Elsweyr. Between Tharn's cryptic letter and Nahfahlaar's strange mood, I'm feeling out of sorts.\n\nTalk to Nahfahlaar. Find out what troubles him while I prepare for Tharn."
"3952276-1-7912";"We're desert folk out of our element. Even worse, I've got missing crew, and injured people from running up against the ice.\n\nWe need meat. Anything would do. If we had someone who could brave the cold and hunt for us, we just might survive this."
"3952276-1-7913";"I'm … I'm not sure we can. But we can make more of Fenn's elixir. Get it into the hands of the people. We need more of Arkay's sacred oil, though.\n\nWe'll have to take it from the supply stockpiled at the Temple of the Divines."
"3952276-1-7914";"Oh, well, now that makes me feel so much better! I never liked the man, but I didn't think he was a traitor.\n\nLook, go to the Blue Palace. Talk to Svana. I'm suddenly beginning to see that this situation is really bad and she needs your help."
"3952276-1-7915";"Start at the stables to the northwest. I saw Acolyte Hjolt, Priest Direnna, and Roligmolf the pilgrim head in that direction.\n\nAfter that, meet me at the Pilgrims' Lodge so we can search for High Priest Varkour. It lies to the west of the temple."
"3952276-1-7916";"Right, Lyris mentioned that. Coincidently, a courier delivered a message for you from Dusktown. I never heard of the place, but she said it was sent by someone named Fennorian. Is that your scholar?\n\nRead the message and let's see if he'll help us."
"3952276-1-7918";"Don't trust them! Only Lyris, she's—!"
"3952276-1-7919";"We're in the hold of Haafingar in Western Skyrim. Solitude is its capital city and the seat of High King Svargrim. If we can find any help against the coven, it will be there.\n\nHead to Solitude and let the authorities know what happened here."
"3952276-1-7920";"Someone needs to warn people away from Karthwatch. As the last of the jarl's guard, the duty falls to me.\n\nLook, I'm desperate to know if the survivors made it to the barrow. Whatever gold I have is yours if you'll find out what became of them."
"3952276-1-7921";"No one knows! The bard responsible left clues to their locations in a song, Nel's Hidden Loves.\n\nJust as yours truly solved the first verse, that instrument surfaced at a secret auction. Are you available for hire to retrieve the instrument?"
"3952276-1-7923";"That's what we thought. But the vampires who go into the Keep never come out. Adusa slipped in with a group of recruits to take a look around. That was days ago ….\n\nIt's been too long. I'm going in after her. I could use a hand, if you're willing."
"3952276-1-7924";"Not yet, but I know we're close! We've hit a few snags, but if we just had a little more time … and maybe a set of extra hands. \n\nYou look very clever! I'm sure if you joined us, we'd solve this in no time. Interested? Claudina would reward you!"
"3952276-1-7925";"The garrison isn't at full strength. It's like Solitude has forgotten us. We haven't seen relief soldiers in quite some time. I need every remaining soldier to guard the town.\n\nYou look capable. Are you willing to aid the garrison and earn some gold?"
"3952276-1-7928";"I was hired to investigate the odd rumblings beneath the stone. The cause, it turns out, are Reachmen working some kind of magic. Stoking the fires of this sleeping mountain.\n\nDon't suppose you'd take a cut to put a stop to it?"
"3952276-1-7929";"Well, that's not the whole of it. A Khajiit woman came to my aid. I've never seen someone move so quickly. It allowed me to escape.\n\nAdusa, that was her name. She told me to find someone named Gwendis outside. But I have to go. I can't stay here."
"3952276-1-7930";"To put him to rest, I think. He's being tormented as much as he's tormenting me. I came to this terrible place to find his remains, but the tomb robbers have angered the dead and I'm terrified to step foot into the barrow alone."
"3952276-1-7931";"I'd like to knock down the palace door, grab him by the throat, and shake him until he listens. That would probably start a war, though, and Jorunn specifically asked me to avoid that.\n\nFor now, let's bring our evidence to Queen Gerhyld."
"3952276-1-7933";"Not sure. Making assumptions is a little above my station. That's a question for Captain Hingrid.\n\nIf you want to help, I'm sure she'd make it worth your while. She's farther down the road, outside of town, watching for the caravan."
"3952276-1-7937";"Hopefully they were able to hold the courtyard and keep those monsters out of the city. You go on ahead and check on them. I need to collect myself.\n\nSolitude needs Princess Svana now, and I'm not quite ready to be her."
"3952276-1-7939";"Viggol's dog. I trust him to keep Viggol safe most days, but he's getting up in age too. Pah. I should never have married a Nord. Always with the heroics.\n\nWould you find him and go with him? I'll pay you what I can. I just want him safe."
"3952276-1-7941";"A gathering of the bards—poetry, song, and drink! It will be first performance of my epic, ""An Adventurer's Triumph!""\n\nEveryone in Solitude must know. I have handbills but there is so much to do. Can you put them up? Then hurry back for the show!"
"3952276-1-7943";"Usually, I would hesitate to accept help from an outsider, but maybe some outside perspective is just what Thulsgreg needs to come to his senses. As chief, I accept your offer.\n\nNow, he'd better listen to you. For his sake."
"3952276-1-7944";"Depends on who you ask. Some members of the clan blame the chief—not out loud, mind you. Others blame the overseer for not falling in line.\n\nEither way, the clan won't last long without the mine. If you wanted to lend a hand, nobody would stop you."
"3952276-1-7945";"I saw Fenrar, one of the town guards, setting up camp in the ruins just outside town. He's a good man. If anyone's mounting a rescue effort, it would be him. Perhaps you could lend a hand."
"3952276-1-7953";"One of the giant insects I told you about.\n\nMy brother needs to stay by Hedrynne's side, so I'm trying to enter the cave. If I can gather a few special ingredients, I can make an elixir to heal my sister. Could you … would you … help me?"
"3952276-1-7954";"She's the ranking priest after High Priest Varkour, but we haven't seen the high priest since the storm hit. Bavian led a group of us to safety, but there are more priests and pilgrims out there.\n\nIf you're willing to help, please talk to Bavian."
"3952276-1-7956";"Snowberries. They are quite popular among Giants and mammoths, and look how large they grow. I don't think that's a coincidence.\n\nI need you to add a copious amount to my mixture and consume it immediately to observe the results."
"3952276-1-7957";"We need someone to verify this claim and—if this tribe exists—bring definitive proof. Landal is specifically interested in objects of cultural significance in order to learn how socially advanced they are.\n\nTry not to disrupt the tribe too much."
"3952276-1-7958";"He wants to analyze specific organs and tissues. The ancient Nords sometimes preserved such things in jars within their barrows. There's a large one called Dragonhome, near the coast.\n\nIt should be fairly unspoiled, on account of the Draugr."
"3952276-1-7959";"Alchemist Rasir said he was close to developing one and then disappeared. \n\nTranya can tell you more. She's down below in the caverns with the others, putting together an effort to search for him. Please, if you can spare any help, we'd be grateful."
"3952276-1-7960";"The Frostbite Raiders. Bastards. Every one. Except, Nelfthea. We've had enough of the bloodshed. She promised to come with me once she's gotten her share from our last raid, but … I hear fighting on the Frozen Coast. She's in trouble. I know it."
"3952276-1-7961";"Everything here is off. Tremors, strange creatures, crazed people and things that shouldn't even be down here.\n\nI told Raynor we needed to turn back, but he ran inside while I was fighting off the worst of them. Think you could go check on him?"
"3952276-1-7962";"Svana said something about a message from a friend of yours, but I wasn't really listening. She wants you to get this Fennorian to help with whatever she's trying to convince High King Svargrim to do.\n\nOr maybe she wanted you to join her for lunch?"
"3952276-1-7963";"Obviously! These idiots aren't infallible. \n\nThey stripped me of my belongings before leaving me to my fate. If you can retrieve three of my things and place them upon a summoning altar, the spell will break and my body will be returned to me."
"3952276-1-7964";"Not specifically, but I'm quite sure it has something to do with fulfilling her promise to you. She's adamant about pleading your case to the high king.\n\nAnyway, I've done my duty. Now I can go back to my favorite location—the tavern!"
"3952276-1-7965";"Once we enter the Scraps, we'll need to locate dormant Dwemer spiders. With my control rod, I'll command them to retrieve the power nodes for us. \n\nI'll need you to gallantly protect me from their more irritable brethren. I'd pay you for your effort."
"3952276-1-7966";"This is Labyrinthian, an ancient city from the First Era. I don't know what my grandfather's interest in it is, but I've heard terrible sounds coming from within.\n\nYou seem sturdy. Might I request your aid in looking for him?"
"3952276-1-7967";"No. My wife, Elle, hired them. She said they'd ease people's minds, but the horkers are only making things worse.\n\nYou look capable. If you could expose them for the charlatans they are, Elle would kick them out. What do you say? It's a paying job."
"3952276-1-7968";"Rigurt is supposed to meet them soon, but there is something wrong with his aide. He is meaner and hungrier than usual. Rigurt cannot meet the thanes without an aide! He needs a new one who will not start things off on the wrong hoof! Can you help?"
"3952276-1-7971";"Not just him. Sea Giants and their howling half-kin. I'd heard tales of sailing Giants, sure, but I never thought they were true.\n\nLook, we'll fight to the last. None of us intend to meet a straw death. But against vampires and Giants? We need help."
"3952276-1-7974";"Gather some stout allies and take this boat north to the island. Once you arrive, speak to Captain Lilmyra.\n\nProvided she's still alive, she'll lay out Thane Ogvar's plan for defending the island."
"3952276-1-7975";"Headed toward the middle of town seeking help, last I saw. Lady Ninetha usually assists the wounded after animal attacks. But she can't handle something unnatural like this on her own. If you're willing, maybe you could offer some help?"
"3952276-1-7976";"The kind that involves grave robbing an ancient evil for nefarious purposes, which comes up more often than I'd like, so now I have to put a stop to Arkasis's experiments.\n\nThat's why I'm here. As for you, I only really need to know if you'll help."
"3952276-1-7978";"Then plant the Undaunted banner in Arkasis's laboratory before you wreck the place, so the smug bastard knows just who bested him before he dies.\n\nThat ought to get his temper boiling."
"3952276-1-7979";"This worm of a fellow found me in Solitude. Insists he just escaped this place and needs to show me what the Lady's up to. The problem is I can't sneak in my usual way with him in tow.\n\nHey, since you're here, feel like helping me storm a castle?"
"3952276-1-7981";"A castle filled with ravenous vampires not enough for you, huh? Ha! I love to see it.\n\nWell, if you really want to get your blood pumping, plant the Undaunted banner just before you battle Lady Thorn. Then she'll know her guests mean business."
"3952276-1-7982";"I need you to kill it and find what's left of the unfortunate patrol. They had scouting reports that are needed back here. If you need anything else, speak to the surviving soldier, <<1>>. Should still be at the Lonely Troll drinking away the grief."
"3952276-1-7983";"Titanborn hasn't shared all the particulars. She just sent me to track you down. Meet her in Riften so you can travel together to Eastmarch.\n\nMay Kyne's kiss grant you safe passage."
"3952276-1-7985";"I'm not sure. I haven't had a chance to talk to him since the events at Tzinghalis's stronghold.\n\nLook, Svana and Fenn need you. They're waiting at the Blue Palace."
"3952276-1-7986";"Get up to the surface and go to the Blue Palace. I'm sure the princess and Fenn have a plan. They'll fill you in on it when you arrive.\n\nGood luck and gods speed, adventurer."
"3952276-1-7990";"What the Swords of Solitude needs is a group of volunteers with the guts to wade into a few of these harrowstorms and stop the accursed witch-work causing these fel winds to blow."
"3952276-1-7991";"Something that stalks the moonlit snows. It steals loved ones away without a sound.\n\nA couple folks sent letters saying they had new sightings. These old legs are much too ruined for travel now. Would you be willing to hear them out for some gold?"
"3952276-1-7992";"An invention of our university's founder, Tjurhane Fyrre. It allows the wielder's mind to travel vast distances and find buried relics. Truths lost to history.\n\nGazing into the Eye requires both skill and talent. How talented are you, I wonder?"
"3952276-1-7993";"The exciting part! Gaze into the Eye and focus on the facets in the glass. Take a breath and try to unify the symbols into a single pattern. Eventually, you'll stop looking at the lens and start looking through it.\n\nWhy don't we just give it a try?"
"3952276-1-7994";"Not specifically, but let me think …. Oh, yes, I remember! She wants to talk to you at the Lonely Troll before she pleads your case to High King Svargrim.\n\nThat's all I've got. Please let Fennorian know how helpful I was, if you would."
"3952276-1-7995";"Just that she was still having trouble convincing her father about the extent of the coven threat. And she seemed very interested in getting Fennorian to help you with that.\n\nI'm sure Fennorian will assist you in any way he can. He's good like that."
"3952276-1-7997";"I intended to! I hired this cart and everything. But as you can see, that didn't work out.\n\nMaybe I was foolish to try and do this on my own. I don't have a lot of field experience. Almost none. But you! You could handle this right? I'll pay you!"
"3952276-1-7998";"And save those goats. <<1>> can't afford to pay otherwise. Werewolves should have the sense not to slaughter all their prey at once, so there's a good chance at least a few are still alive. Feed them these berries and they'll wander home, supposedly."
"3952276-1-7999";"Right now the Orcs are only hurling accusations, but soon they'll be throwing more than insults and that'll turn into a civil war that'll spill into our holds. We need to remove Skreg and provide proof that he wasn't worthy of being champion first."
"3952276-1-8000";"Don't know. Go find him if you're so curious. \n\nHis name is Viggol. Says they used to call him The Hero of Haafingar back in his glory days. Got to admire his spirit, but you ask me? I think it's time for him to find a new line of work."
"3952276-1-8001";"A wizened old hagraven that's lived far too long. Legend says she sucks up the life of the land itself to sustain her longevity. She appears to be doing just that near Morthal. Kill her and use this mixture to cleanse the Shademother's corruption."
"3952276-1-8002";"Expired spriggans tend to decompose rather quickly, but if you find any that are recently deceased, that should do. More likely, you'll have to chop down some that you encounter. Careful, they are more aggressive than most trees."
"3952276-1-8005";"We need someone to test the scholar's Dissonance Apparatus on some Dwemer constructs, as well as locate one of their heartcogs.\n\nThe Dwemer ruin affectionately referred to as the Scraps should be an ideal location. I'll mark it on your map."
"3952276-1-8006";"There's an ancient Nord prison called Midnight Barrow. Our research indicates history's worst criminals were entombed there, and their spirits trapped within umbric urns.\n\nAll you need to do is smash those urns and observe the results."
"3952276-1-8008";"That's unlikely. The High Priest provided us this relic of Arkay to perform funeral rites on the victims, for the sake of their souls and to drive out any lingering risk of undeath.\n\nCleanse the bodies and kill the vampires. <<1>> can tell you more."
"3952276-1-8010";"Destroy it and any Dwarven scrap laying around as well, just to be sure the thing doesn't somehow repair itself if you do manage to break it.\n\nHere's where the explorer claims to have found this giant construct. Good luck."
"3952276-1-8011";"What the Swords of Solitude needs is a group of volunteers with the guts to wade into a few of these harrowstorms and stop the accursed witch-work that is causing these fel winds to blow."
"3952276-1-8020";"It's quite simple. I recorded the locations of three verses of a powerful incantation in my journal, on the off chance something like this occurred.\n\nAcquire the verses, come back, and dispel this illusion. I'll make it worth your while, I promise!"
"3952276-1-8021";"""If you're the sorry bastard that stole my property, welcome to the end of your miserable life! The poison works fast. If you're not the unlucky milk drinker that ate the fish, bring this note to the Morthal docks. I'll pay!\n\n-Angrar"""
"3952276-1-8025";"Hamvir's sister was attacked by a giant insect. Even now, she lies near death as acidic poison courses through her blood.\n\nI'm on my way to Dragon Bridge to seek help, but if you're heading toward the cave by any chance, perhaps you could aid them?"
"3952276-1-8027";"But of course!\n\nThey stripped me of my belongings before turning me into this. If three of my things are placed upon a summoning altar, the spell will break. I need someone to take me to their hideout, a place called Dragonhome, and do this for me."
"3952276-1-8035";"Yes, but we need to proceed with caution. We don't know the purpose of the keystone, and we don't know what they plan to do with it. That said, we are not without our own talents.\n\nWe can overcome any obstacles and find a way forward. We always do."
"3952276-1-8036";"An outsider? Not likely. We need someone to intercede on our behalf.\n\nWe need Bradan. He's a friend, and he holds the respect of the clan. If he vouches for you, Nathari might talk to you. He often visits Hroldan Ring to trade news. Meet me there."
"3952276-1-8037";"We know that one of the Gray Host's original ruling council is rebuilding their army, gathering vampires and werewolves to their banner. And we know they're experimenting with life energy.\n\nSo, what do you say? Ready for another adventure?"
"3952276-1-8040";"Hey, I was doing stuff before you showed up!\n\nLook, some vampires and werewolves have formed a new Gray Host. One of their original ruling councilors may be leading them. And they seem to be experimenting with life energy. Will you help me?"
"3952276-1-8041";"It's an alliance of vampires, witches, and werewolves bent on slaughter and destruction. To protect the Reach, I need to learn why the Gray Host has come here. And I need to secure the cooperation of Ard Caddach.\n\nWould you be willing to help me?"
"3952276-1-8042";"Rada tried to use Dwarven devices once, but nothing came of it. Interesting.\n\nAs I toured the city, I met Nolovan. He works with Dwarven scrap in the southeast section of Markarth. Maybe he can lead us to this keystone before Lady Belain acquires it."
"3952276-1-8043";"A good question. Despite your success stopping High King Svargrim and Lady Belain, the reawakening of the Dark Heart has provided the Dwarven orrery with a frightening source of power. But to what end?\n\nI need your help to ascertain the answer."
"3952276-1-8044";"Not different precisely. He's been … distracted. Mulling something over. He'll tell me when he's ready, I guess, but he wants to talk to you. You are the one who defeated Svargrim and Lady Belain, after all.\n\nHe's waiting in Understone Keep."
"3952276-1-8046";"Well, that would explain it. You might have stopped it from fully awakening, but Verandis says something has changed. Even I could feel it.\n\nCome on. Verandis needs you to meet him at Nighthollow Keep. That's where he traced the dark energy to."
"3952276-1-8047";"Look around. And hopefully find nothing. Determine this was all just a big misunderstanding. That Verandis was never a member of the Gray Host. If not, then I suppose I want to find undeniable proof that my mentor was a monster.\n\nSo, can we go now?"
"3952276-1-8048";"Look around. Hopefully discover this is all just a big misunderstanding. That my mentor Verandis was never a part of the Gray Host. If not, I guess I want solid evidence that he was a monster.\n\nCome on, the cart's waiting for us at Ravenwatch Castle."
"3952276-1-8049";"All you need to know is a clan's witch matron is attempting a ritual that could cause calamity across the Reach. And to insult us further, she's abducting innocent Reachfolk to sacrifice for it.\n\nYou should find her here. Please rescue those people."
"3952276-1-8050";"Each of their captured warriors carried a talisman with them. They would be of no value to the Thornroot, but they hold significant value to the Wildblood. They'd like the talismans returned, if possible.\n\nThink you can find a few of them?"
"3952276-1-8051";"I don't know much yet, but I do know how to stop a harrowstorm. I'll tell you, if you're willing to help.\n\nTake some friends, find the storm, and destroy all the witch pikes and gray reliquaries you find. Without them, the summoning ritual will fail."
"3952276-1-8052";"I don't know much yet, but I do know how to stop a harrowstorm. I'll tell you, if you're willing to help.\n\nTake some friends, find the storm, and destroy all the witch pikes and gray reliquaries you find. Without them, the summoning ritual will fail."
"3952276-1-8053";"I never intended my theories to be turned into reality. When my research into a way to grant mortals the same immortality as vampires kept leading down dark paths, I abandoned it. I should have also destroyed it.\n\nRada corrupted it for his own ends."
"3952276-1-8054";"He says that if he can enter the sanctuary realm, he can take control of the ritual. With luck, after he does that he can shut down the Darkstorm. All I know if that we have to help him. We have to try.\n\nAre you with us?"
"3952276-1-8055";"Realms of Oblivion leak into this cavern. Three wings, each holding two champions of the great spirits.\n\nPass through each wing. Defeat every creature found within. Only once you clear a wing may you move on to the next."
"3952276-1-8056";"Right now, it's the bunny I miss the most. Here, try this whistle. If <<1>> hears it, she'll come running. And I guess <<2>> might hear the sound, too. Just don't say he's a good boy. This is his fault, after all.\n\nSo, will you help?"
"3952276-1-8057";"Wards blessed by the spirits that protect our village. The wards stopped the worst of the storm, but they must be restored. I tried to reach them, but the wilderness has become too dangerous. \n\nI prayed for help. Did the spirits send you to aid me?"
"3952276-1-8059";"The alliance leaders sponsor us to clean out the corners of their realms, so we're flush with plunder. We're using it as incentive for those who can complete contracts, conquer crypts, uh… something something with the letter c.\n\nYou in?"
"3952276-1-8060";"This one was close to saving a vampire from a life of crime and evil intentions. Why Kathad went back to them, I do not know. But Adusa-daro is not ready to give up on him quite yet.\n\nWill you help me extract Kathad from the Lothid clan, five-claw?"
"3952276-1-8061";"I will deal with Rada. After you warn Caddach, find Lady Belain. Defeat her and the Reachfolk will stand a better chance against the assaulting army. And if you can end the massacre, that will stop the flow of energy into the Dark Heart.\n\nNow, go!"
"3952276-1-8062";"Verandis says the Dark Heart's already awake, but it needs more souls to reach full power.\n\nOh, he also said that Lady Belain is somewhere in Markarth. She came to lead the Gray Host army. If we can remove her from the battlefield, all the better."
"3952276-1-8063";"The Thornroot shamans use tools blessed specifically for this ritual. Whether this consecration is necessary is beside the point. The Thornroot believe it is.\n\nIf you destroy these tools, it will impair their ability to continue with the ritual."
"3952276-1-8065";"My contacts believe the matron keeps an effigy in her possession that grants her power. A Reach totem of some kind. If you can obtain it, that should weaken the matron and the Thornroot clan considerably. \n\nFind the totem and bring it to me."
"3952276-1-8067";"My time in the Dark Heart was suffocating. Every moment was an eternity. I can't reckon the time our souls spent in that place. Now, alive again, even the simple act of breathing is amazing.\n\nI'll make my way, but you shouldn't keep Lyris."
"3952276-1-8068";"I'm not sure. Perhaps it's for a ritual of some sort? At any rate, they shouldn't be too hard to find. Gather a few samples for me, and I'll make sure that they get into the right hands."
"3952276-1-8069";"I need someone to gather samples of the fungal mold. The creatures should naturally shed it, so it will be easy to collect. But there's no telling how this affliction has affected them, so I advise caution.\n\nWhat do you say? There's pay involved."
"3952276-1-8070";"The mage's experiment, as near as I can tell, involves a strange egg. He might be trying to hatch a creature, or something even more sinister. Impossible to know for sure. \n\nRegardless, the egg needs to be destroyed before it comes to fruition."
"3952276-1-8072";"Oh. Right. Arkasis seems to be a popular guy, despite everything I heard about him. I dodged a few of his lackeys' patrols and they seem to have a large pack of lycanthropes sniffing around.\n\nI don't think the stealthy approach will work."
"3952276-1-8073";"When I was inside the cave I noticed something unusual. The plants, they emit some kind of strange energy. It was too dangerous in there, but I must confirm my suspicions. Determine if this is my fault.\n\nWould you accompany me to take a closer look?"
"3952276-1-8074";"What do you think I'm going to do? Sell them love potions? I was hoping to sneak inside and find out what the Gray Host is plotting here, but now that you're here we can probably accomplish more than a little spying. Let's stop Arkasis."
"3952276-1-8075";"The people who hired me provided a map to a library under the mansion. My job is to find some book that the old owners hid down there.\n\nHey, care to join forces? Together we can grab this book in no time. And you can keep any loot you find."
"3952276-1-8077";"After you empty the rest of the True-Sworn from the villa, plant the Undaunted banner before taking on Pyroturge Encratis.\n\nHe should know just who's heading his way before you snuff him out for good."
"3952276-1-8078";"This mine holds much more than bats and mold. A cult seeking immense power waits within. I fear that Drathas alone cannot withstand such foes.\n\nMore of us could improve our odds. How about I sweeten the deal? Some gold if you help retrieve the box?"
"3952276-1-8080";"After you send those otherworldly monsters packing, plant the Undaunted banner just before the fight with Baron Zaudrus. He'll put up a fight, but I bet you can handle it.\n\nShow that kidnapping slaver the true meaning of destruction."
"3952276-1-8082";"I suspect the crone seeks to abuse Namira's power. Whatever this ritual is, it must be stopped.\n\nI also heard that she writes things down like a common Nord heretic. If this is true, gather whatever notes you find so that I may destroy them."
"3952276-1-8083";"I've only ever seen it once before. The power of the ritual creates wounds in the air, as if the very world was split open at the seams. \n\nThis charm should counteract it. Use it to close any tears you encounter and end this ritual."
"3952276-1-8084";"He claims it disrupts those metal crawlers, making them docile. I'm sure he'd be happy as a goat in wet grass to find out it works. More importantly, if that construct exists, I want it destroyed. We have enough problems. We don't need another one."
"3952276-1-8085";"I've no clue. Don't care, either. Those metal beasts are nothing but trouble. I want it taken care of.\n\nWe'll pay you to head down into that cave and check it out. If you find that thing, destroy it. Same goes for the beacons."
"3952276-1-8086";"Most of that Dwarf junk is worthless, but some of it can be valuable if used right. If that thing's dumped some scrap, we might as well collect it before we destroy the rest. \n\nThe job's easy. Destroy the construct and bring back any scrap you find."
"3952276-1-8087";"She wants to enter the old Dwarven ruins and find someone named Kathad. But those ruins are crawling with vampires! Boss Trenlor's Lothid clan, to be exact! I told her, no thank you.\n\nI hate to walk away from gold, but I can't spend it if I'm dead."
"3952276-1-8088";"The Thornroots want protectors. They welcomed my clan, then betrayed us. My kin are in cages, waiting to be made into living weapons.\n\nI'll pay you well to teach the Thornroots a lesson. Free my clan, and burn their briarheart tree. Are you game?"
"3952276-1-8089";"Obviously, I want to poke around inside and see if Talfyg is telling the truth. Usually I'd sneak my way past the patrols. But I don't trust that he would keep up with me.\n\nHey—I have an idea. Interested in breaking down the front door?"
"3952276-1-8090";"We made such a great team in Stone Garden, I figure let's do it again. Except I need to keep a close eye on Talfyg, so I can't sneak in like I usually would.\n\nSo, uh, that's where you come in. How do you feel about storming the castle?"
"3952276-1-8092";"You must light a candle at a shrine dedicated to the Old Life and write a short message to one who has passed on. Most shrines have parchment available. Then, you simply pass your message over the flame. You should give it a try."
"3952276-1-8094";"All I know is that she found something at the Reachwind Ritual Site. It really got her companion excited. They stayed behind and sent me on ahead to deliver the message. Which I have done.\n\nNow to see if a Nord can buy some mead around here."
"3952276-1-8095";"It's not so much a matter of need as of instruction. I want your example to teach these clans how to put aside their differences and get along. \n\nPresent yourself to the betrothed, Eslyn and Madearn, and wish them good will. That should suffice."
"3952276-1-8106";"I sure do. A cave lies to the south that my clan calls Vateshran Hollows. We hold the Vateshran's Rites there, a combat ritual meant to test our warrior's mettle.\n\nI challenge you to go there! Prove that you belong in the Reach."
"3952276-1-8108";"Even scrap will do. We weave it into our armor for better protection.\n\nTravel to the ruins of Bthardamz and bring back any metal you find. It will make a difference, I promise you."
"3952276-1-8109";"Not just any silver. The enchanted ore from the Dwarven depths of Bthar-Zel is particularly potent against the forces of the Gray Host.\n\nWe could use more of it, if you are willing to brave the dangers of that lost city."
"3952276-1-8110";"Unless you think this task is beyond you, I have no one else to entrust it to. Descend into Blackreach and dismantle the Dwarven constructs that guard the Library of Arkthzand. \n\nGather the gemstones from the wreckage and bring them to me."
"3952276-1-8112";"The Wayward Guardians have pledged to defend Markarth and the Reach. We cannot let our people be attacked from below again.\n\nDrive the Gray Host out of Nchuand-Zel. Bring me their sigils as proof of their demise. This is what I ask you to do."
"3952276-1-8113";"While Reachfolk generally have no need of books and scrolls, some of our people can read and write. Including some of our witches. They need the scrolls that deal with Nighthollow magic and the tome to help translate the language. \n\nWill you aid us?"
"3952276-1-8114";"Take this vial, filled with pure water from the Karth, to the Shrine of Lorkh at the top of the valley. Let the soil drink its fill and cleanse the shrine.\n\nWhen we reclaim the land, the great spirits will remember. Will you do this for us, harrier?"
"3952276-1-8115";"Even those without a clan deserve to die under the open sky. Whatever these people did to deserve exile, they are still Reachfolk.\n\nI need someone to descend into Blackreach and find them. The scout said the camp was near an underground river."
"3952276-1-8117";"The Arkthzand Keystone. The thing we went down into Bthar-Zel to find. We still have no idea what they plan to use it for, but if they want it, we need to try to get it back.\n\nAnyway, Verandis wants you to meet him outside Bthar-Zel in Blackreach."
"3952276-1-8118";"You'd need to ask her about that. I'm only the messenger. Again.\n\nLook, go to Rebel's Retreat and talk to Arana. I'll wait here for Verandis. He's bound to wander by sooner or later."
"3952276-1-8119";"The ark-a-what-now? Is that some sort of Dwarf thing?\n\nNever mind. Verandis will fill me in later. Right now, you need to go see him. Immediately, if not sooner."
"3952276-1-8120";"The final relic required to complete this shrine resides at Lost Valley Redoubt. I sent Apprentice Orla there to find it, but after all this, I fear for her safety.\n\nGo, hunter. Help Orla retrieve the Symbol of Uricanbeg. Prove your worth to Hircine."
"3952276-1-8121";"Realms of Oblivion leak into this cavern. Three wings, each holding two champions of the great spirits.\n\nPass through each wing. Defeat every creature found within. Only once you clear a wing may you move on to the next."
"3952276-1-8123";"The kind that comes with a terrible curse and has the locals all in a tither! Nisswo Somarz is very cross with me. She insists I return to the xanmeer and set things right. And Stibbons isn't any help. Not in his current state. Will you assist me?"
"3952276-1-8124";"Calls herself Lady Clarisse Laurent. And her manservant's name is Stibbons, though they say he is not in good shape.\n\nIf she's actually going to break the curse, she'll need help, but no one will go near her while the curse infests the xanmeer."
"3952276-1-8125";"Relax. It was a perfectly innocent vision-dream. An image in my head so I'd recognize you, you understand. She ordered me to deliver a letter. The one over there on that table, actually. May the blessings of the Dread Lady be upon you, chosen mortal."
"3952276-1-8126";"No, I have another task for you. Summon what allies you can to Fort Redmane to help defend the Ambitions. I sent my legion ahead, but I fear we will need more warriors.\n\nBefore you go, tell the Ambitions what we are doing and why. They trust you."
"3952276-1-8128";"With that guild of assassins, I'm not sure what to think. But Jirich is missing and I don't have enough brigadines at the ready to conduct a proper search. \n\nYou look capable. Care to earn some gold and help us determine the councilor's fate?"
"3952276-1-8129";"Of course it does! Nothing has been easy since I found that strange book and started chasing down Leovic's secret.\n\nWell, are you still interested in solving the mystery of the Ambitions? Will you come with me to Bloodrun Cave?"
"3952276-1-8130";"Keep the Ambitions safe, but we need to find a better place to hide them.\n\nTalk to the Ambitions. Perhaps the third one you rescued. Sombren, was it? Eveli said he wasn't locked in a vault when the cult found him. Maybe he knows more than the twins."
"3952276-1-8132";"Talk to the courier. Find out who sent them and what news they've brought us. I mean, provided you're still willing to stick around and help. Technically, I suppose, you've already finished the job Captain Rian hired you to do.\n\nSo, what do you say?"
"3952276-1-8133";"After a big argument, they disbanded. Three moved to the outskirts of the village, and one stayed. She died during a raid by Naxhosa's people.\n\nWe need the Winds to come back together. Can you talk to them? Convince them to return and I'll pay you."
"3952276-1-8134";"What this situation needs is an outsider's perspective. My people are too enraged to think clearly, and the lieutenant will not talk to us anyway. \n\nWe need someone outside the tribe to mediate. You would be compensated, of course! What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8135";"""Bring this invitation to <<1>> for an official bout with King Boar! Or just take the ham-fisted approach and crash the festivities. That's sure to be entertaining!\n\n""By decree of Jester King Emeric—and his beauteous queen—let the games begin!"""
"3952276-1-8136";"I did not expect quite so many deadly creatures nesting in the abbey when I set out, otherwise I would have enlisted fighters before departing. Priests of Zenithar are not known for their might, but we have deep pockets. \n\nAre you for hire?"
"3952276-1-8137";"I need you to come with me into this xanmeer and free my friends in order to interrupt the Sul-Xan's rituals. Then, we must destroy the Idol of Xulunaht to prevent this atrocity from befalling another clan.\n\nI will pay you handsomely for your aid."
"3952276-1-8138";"More than I can name and none that I can grant. I sent word to Leyawiin, but so far I've heard nothing.\n\nThe Painted Eye will kill those hostages if we storm the fortress. I need someone who can get inside quietly and free them. I'll pay for results."
"3952276-1-8140";"Untie me, please. The Silvelles will pay well if you help me get Quistley out of whatever trouble he's in, and I could use someone to watch my back. Interested?\n\nOh, and check the shack. I think Tenarei dropped something during our struggle."
"3952276-1-8141";"It's written in a language I've never seen before. Looking at the pages makes my eyes hurt, and just carrying it around … it's kind of uncomfortable.\n\nWill you come with me to Riften? I want to deliver the book and be done with this business."
"3952276-1-8142";"I hope to recover proof that this is Phalevon's tomb. His armor, helm, and sword would do nicely. But I didn't get far before I found the cavern overrun with Goblins and Minotaurs, and parts of it are flooded. \n\nI'll pay you well to help me."
"3952276-1-8144";"Governor Keshu of Gideon! Councilor Lovidicus says she knows the swamps and bogs of Black Marsh like the back of her hand.\n\nSo, can I count on you? Will you come with me to Gideon to talk to Keshu the Black Fin?"
"3952276-1-8145";"Oh, nothing too strenuous. Just need a bit of help with final preparations. Lifting the odd box, calibrating a few apparatuses, warding off any murderous undead. Standard field work. I would compensate you, of course.\n\nSo? Care to join us? Please?"
"3952276-1-8147";"Well, you see, handlers of the Festival Arena have collected all of the most rot—er—exceptionally ripe mudcrab apples for King Boar to gorge on during his battles, but that leaves nothing left for Jad'zirri to use for her cider. You see?"
"3952276-1-8149";"That's what I said, isn't it? Got to be in the right state of mind for tree-speaking. Just gets my thoughts in a jumble. I could use a clear head right now … like yours!\n\nWhat say you help me find the harrada seed? I'll make it worth your while!"
"3952276-1-8152";"They say a tragic affair played out there long ago and lovestruck spirits still haunt the castle.\n\nI acquired a magic lantern that allows me to speak with ghosts. I just need someone to help fight off dangerous spirits. The job pays well, I promise!"
"3952276-1-8153";"Yes, when I arrived here, he had already raised many Shadowscale bodies to fight for him.\n\nIn order to spare the three I came to perform last rights upon from this fate, I must destroy their skeletons. Will you help? I can pay you for your services."
"3952276-1-8154";"None. That farmer, Heseph, said his sister was among the afflicted, and she died recently. At least he thought she died, but she left no corpse.\n\nI must clear the troupe's name. With the locals wary as they are, though, I need help. And I can pay."
"3952276-1-8155";"My thought is Sister of Pools might see Deet-Loh bathing in her waters and consider it an act of humility. Then maybe she'd turn him back.\n\nI can't return to those ruins by myself. Way too dangerous. I have some gold, if you're willing to help."
"3952276-1-8156";"""Bring this invitation to <<1>> for an official bout with King Boar! Or just take the ham-fisted approach and crash the festivities. That's sure to be entertaining!\n\n""By decree of Jester King Emeric—and his beauteous queen—let the games begin!"""
"3952276-1-8160";"I need your help investigating the vents. I must commune with the spirits at each site to determine the best course of action—but catching those buggers requires someone spry. And the ritual is easier with two people.\n\nI'll pay if you'll help."
"3952276-1-8162";"Come with me inside and free us from the cult's clutches! Though I am very mighty, it is not within my power to save myself or my Court! I need your assistance! \n\nThe Blackfeather Court will owe you a great boon if you take on this sacred duty."
"3952276-1-8164";"I need someone to venture into the ruins of Vunalk and gather toxicodor petals, bog dog dung, and death hopper bile. Mix all of those into a solution and use it to bless Leric. That should change his luck from bad to good.\n\nI will pay, of course."
"3952276-1-8165";"Most likely, the scholars dug up some sort of cursed heirloom. Minotaurs are often drawn to things like that. So, when you deal with the Minotaur, make sure you collect any unearthed heirlooms or curios you find.\n\nI'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8167";"Elves. A whole lot of them. All brightly colored and prancing about in strange masks. Daedra worship, if you ask me.\n\nThey're setup on the outskirts of town. If you want to chase them off, I won't stop you, but I just as soon never see you again."
"3952276-1-8170";"<Written in another hand.> \n\n""Big job. Seems less than legal, but the gold's real. Meet north of Fort Redmane. Bring friends. See you soon, little brother. —Mirri"""
"3952276-1-8171";"A host of scuttling Mephala-spawn invaded the vault. I don't know how, but I do know why.\n\nThey seek to take something from Dagon—a blasphemous device. We can't let either faction possess it, whatever it is. So, we destroy it. Will you help?"
"3952276-1-8172";"It didn't. But now her assistant wants us to recover any notes the scholar managed to record before the Toad-Tongues ate her.\n\nCan you deal with War Chief Zathmoz and collect the scholar's lost notes? You'll be well paid, of course."
"3952276-1-8173";"We want to put a stop to that, as you might expect. I need someone to wipe out this camp of Sul-Xan ritualists and save the captives they're holding before the Sul-Xan sacrifice them.\n\nAre you willing to take the job?"
"3952276-1-8174";"The biggest, meanest death hopper anyone's ever seen. Imagine a man-eating frog the size of a cow. Then give it a bad temper and decades of froggish guile and dirty tricks.\n\nI guess the legates really want those singing frogs. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8175";"Because he decorates his lair with the remains of his victims. Xeemhok mauls them so badly they are unrecognizable.\n\nNot only do we need to defeat the Trophy-Taker, we need to search the bodies in his lair for tokens to identify the fallen."
"3952276-1-8176";"Those few who have escaped report only a name: Ghemvas the Harbinger.\n\nCan you seek out Ghemvas and destroy it? You'll also need to use holy oil to sanctify the bodies of those who have been killed. Their very souls are in peril."
"3952276-1-8177";"Books are great! If I'd known this was here, I probably would have come anyway. Even if I wasn't getting paid.\n\nI have an idea, want to join me? We worked so well together before—it'll be fun! And you can keep any loot you find."
"3952276-1-8178";"When the swarm emerged, our warriors defended us while we escaped. Two of my apprentices were among them. I expect they are all gone.\n\nYou appear stiff of spine—perhaps you could purge the Sul-Xan from our land? I offer gifts if you succeed."
"3952276-1-8181";"With a stiff tail and bared abdomen, I beg for your aid. Please, gather a force of your strongest allies. Travel to Rockgrove and drive out the Sul-Xan.\n\nDefend what is left of my tribe and they will surely reward you."
"3952276-1-8185";"If we had one of their business ledgers, I'd have an understanding of the Fang-Furls' operations. Perhaps even find a weakness ripe for exploiting.\n\nIf you could procure one of those ledgers for us, my brother and I would pay you handsomely."
"3952276-1-8188";"They think my Granna Cerise murdered their high priest decades ago. It's not true, and I mean to set the record straight. Might take a little snooping around, but the evidence is here. I know it!\n\nWant to lend a hand? Don't have much, but I can pay."
"3952276-1-8189";"Sure! The gardens behind the governor's mansion are big enough to entertain an entire army!\n\nHey, before you join us, can you check on Sombren and Calia? Invite them to the party? They went back to the Temple of Dibella in Gideon."
"3952276-1-8190";"He says he found an old letter in Lord Silvelle's study. A letter about my mother. \n\nShe died when I was very young, and I'm not sure how exactly she knew the Silvelles. But I want to know more. What do you think about a trip to Daggerfall?"
"3952276-1-8191";"Talk to my commander, Captain Rian Liore. You can find him just outside the city gates, trying to appease some of the nobles.\n\nTell him I sent you and he'll put you right to work, I'm sure."
"3952276-1-8193";"Clairene has had decades to reach out to me. Either she doesn't know I'm alive, or she wants nothing to do with me. Either way, my return may be unwelcome.\n\nI should approach the matter with care. Would you come to Wayrest with me?"
"3952276-1-8194";"Use your discretion. We want to know if the Dark Brotherhood is really behind the murders. And if so, who gave them their contract? Moreover, we want to dissuade them from reestablishing a presence here in Blackwood.\n\nSo, observe and investigate."
"3952276-1-8195";"Lovidicus believes so, but Eveli's waiting for you before proceeding. Meet her near the entrance to Leyawiin Castle.\n\nAnd remember that you're still in the city's service. You'll be well rewarded for your efforts in this matter, whatever the outcome."
"3952276-1-8196";"More or less.\n\nWill you go to Gideon? Leyawiin will continue to compensate you for any assistance you can provide in this matter."
"3952276-1-8197";"The kind we don't want to speak openly about. There are ears everywhere.\n\nGo to Gideon and speak to Governor Keshu. You've served us well so far. Keep it up and Leyawiin will reward you greatly. You have my word."
"3952276-1-8199";"Mom neglected to mention it, I'm sure, but my father mentioned getting an angry letter from one of their old clients at the Stormhold Mages Guild claiming she reneged on their arrangement after taking payment.\n\nWould you mind if we pay them a visit?"
"3952276-1-8200";"<<1>> just wants the documents destroyed. It should be easy enough work, so long as you make it past the crawlies inside Bloodrun Cave. I marked the likely places for the caches on your map.\n\nIf you want to talk to <<1>> directly, he's in town."
"3952276-1-8201";"Want to? No. Need to? Probably. My mom's been trying to fulfill her filial duty since she buried my grandfather. I'd rather not come by it the same way.\n\nI was thinking I'd pay the old Mer a visit at our ancestral tomb. Will you join me?"
"3952276-1-8202";"Strange figures in hoods. Travelers who disappear. Masked nobles and dark revels. Smuggler's tales to scare off the locals, or something more?\n\nYou seem brave. Perhaps you are interested? Remember your old friend Zeechis if you find riches there!"
"3952276-1-8203";"The ruins are likely dangerous, and I understand she is not much of a fighter. She asks that someone venture inside for her and take notes on what they observe. Nothing exhaustive, just a brief account.\n\nI'll mark the ruin on your map for you."
"3952276-1-8204";"I was bid to say nothing else. Just that your presence is required in Gideon as soon as you can get there.\n\nWill you go see the general?"
"3952276-1-8206";"I need you to venture inside the Xi-Tsei stone-nest and locate the Nightwielder's Tome. I will mark your map with the place Nesh-Tei thought it most likely to be.\n\nBring the tome to me so Nesh-Tei may find his path. You will not go unrewarded."
"3952276-1-8207";"Not directly, but I overheard her and Governor Keshu discussing the arrival of a courier. I suspect that is what the Wood Elf wishes to tell you about.\n\nWill you go to the governor's mansion?"
"3952276-1-8208";"I understand they're staying at the Temple of Dibella in Gideon. If they're not there, someone in the temple should be able to direct you.\n\nNow go. I look forward to seeing you at the party!"
"3952276-1-8209";"Calia and Sombren have been keeping to themselves since events at Fort Redmane. You can find them at the Temple of Dibella in Gideon."
"3952276-1-8211";"Free my little brother and the others before something terrible befalls them. I don't know if I can do this on my own, but I have to try.\n\nCan I count on your help? Or were all the questions just morbid curiosity? I can pay if I have to."
"3952276-1-8214";"The Shade Sickle—a powerful instrument of my will. For her inability to protect it, Millona will never sleep again. I wonder how long she can last.\n\nPerhaps you have the mettle to return my sickle? With it, you would reap great reward."
"3952276-1-8216";"Tee-Wan did not want to disclose too many details. This is a private matter, and he is always careful with information. I am sorry I cannot tell you more. I am but the messenger.\n\nHe awaits you at the graveyard. He will tell you everything there."
"3952276-1-8217";"I think they want you to investigate. Ascertain the situation. But the Wood Elf would know more. I'm just an overqualified messenger.\n\nWill you heed the captain and go to Leyawiin Castle? Eveli Sharp-Arrow is anxiously awaiting your arrival."
"3952276-1-8218";"It seems that these crows in particular are, or were, involved with Nocturnal somehow. Very mysterious. If you are curious, you can find Rugrol in the chapel, and Allereth in the cemetery next to it.\n\nIf not, head over to <<1>> and find those eggs."
"3952276-1-8219";"<<1>> said she had an idea about how to weaken the group by destroying some of their ritual tools, but she herself is not much of a fighter. She is willing to pay whoever can do the job for her.\n\nIf you're interested, she is waiting by the docks."
"3952276-1-8220";"Fun, right? I would advise caution, of course. <<1>> is not the safest place. Which is why the client did not think she could go herself.\n\nIf you would like to speak to her before you head out, she should still be in the alleyway nearby."
"3952276-1-8223";"We call them the Winds. The bandits killed one, and the others refuse to leave their isolation and help us. \n\nPerhaps you could convince them? An outsider's voice may change their minds. No doubt the village will reward you if the Winds see reason."
"3952276-1-8224";"Our protectors, the Four Winds, used to keep our village safe. Perhaps you have heard of them? Their deeds are legend. \n\nBut they went into solitude. Except one, who Naxhosa cut down. If you can, help me convince them to return. I can reward you."
"3952276-1-8230";"I hoped a word with the knight commander would prove that the attack was the work of some overzealous recruits, but he's refused to see me or return the relics taken from my temple.\n\nI can offer more than blessings for their return."
"3952276-1-8232";"Raise the Undaunted banner in a declaration of war with the Knights of the Silver Rose. Once they know who's come to kick their teeth in, get on and do it."
"3952276-1-8233";"If this ambush was any indication, we're going to face a fair amount of resistance searching these ruins. Help us clear out the prison and discover the source of the magical activity here and we'll compensate you for your service."
"3952276-1-8235";"Word is the Daedra are summoning some kinda Incarnate that's really stirring up the muck down in Black Marsh. Plant the Undaunted banner where you find it and send it crashing back into the dirt."
"3952276-1-8236";"I simply wish to wade in the rivers that you will change. \n\nVenture through Blackwood. Triumph in a great hunt, see a place that was once forgotten, answer the call of petitioners! Report back once you have made the ripples, and I will reward you."
"3952276-1-8243";"I'd tell you to put up your feet, but I know you better than that by now. You never sit still for long. \n\nSo I say we head to Fargrave and start by checking in with Calia and Madam Whim first. We don't even know if they've heard what happened yet."
"3952276-1-8244";"We know not the source of the Spire's protection. Any change might end it. Including mortal deaths.\n\nYou are mortal. Save your people. Speak to them so I can find the one who seeks violence. If lives do not concern you, I can provide mortal coin."
"3952276-1-8245";"When you gather enough, you will be able to fashion an effigy of the Horror. Once we imbue it with energy from the Evergloam, it will allow you to lure the creature into a pocket realm. \n\nThere, you will be able to defeat it. Now go! Time is short!"
"3952276-1-8246";"We must return to Fargrave. Check with my contacts there.\n\nI have also given Eveli the task to search through the Longhouse Emperor's documents to look for more clues pertaining to the Fourth Ambition. She will meet us in Fargrave's Plaza of Portals."
"3952276-1-8247";"Interesting. And you found this in the vault? The one Moricar claimed belonged to his daughter? Then show it to the Anchorite. Perhaps she can remember something and ascertain its purpose.\n\nWe will need some advantage the next time we face Sombren."
"3952276-1-8248";"I may have heard something about Ambitions, someone named Sombren, and a possible weapon to use against Mehrunes Dagon. But that's all I heard, and I don't want to know anymore!\n\nYou should head to the House of Whims as soon as possible."
"3952276-1-8249";"No. This one just saw the cultists force her sister, Pibiha, inside. If Tufeh could fight, those kyncursed cultists would be hanging above a lava flow by their ears! \n\nTufeh cannot help Pibiha now. Would you look for her? Tufeh can pay!"
"3952276-1-8250";"Interesting. The Bladebearer clan's scouts are indeed competent. Perhaps they can find the trail where we have thus far turned up nothing.\n\nVery well. Find Rynkyus and see what he has learned. Meanwhile, I have my own research to conduct."
"3952276-1-8251";"Portal keys, when properly attuned, can open paths where none existed before. But we require an expert for this.\n\nTalk to Madam Whim, little mortal. She likes you. Convince her to help. If we have to assault the front gate, then we've already lost."
"3952276-1-8252";"Calm? I suppose. But I have faith in Lyranth, and she seems to have faith in you. I'll mark the destination on your map. Plus, I secured transportation—the regal Sweet Daffodil.\n\nOh, and take this pendant. You'll need it when you get there."
"3952276-1-8257";"The relic opens a portal to Oblivion. Most likely the Deadlands. Regardless, we can't just stroll in and expect them to reveal their plans.\n\nI'll use those items to create a potion to fool them. It will make you appear to be the corpse lying here."
"3952276-1-8258";"I am not privy to all of Lyranth's plans. She just requested that I summon you. She's waiting in the Marbruk Outlaws Refuge. Once you present yourself, I'm sure she'll tell you everything you need to know.\n\nNow, hurry. Our world hangs in the balance."
"3952276-1-8259";"I sent for your Wood Elf friend, Eveli Sharp-Arrow. I asked her to comb through the Longhouse Emperor's documents to look for more clues as to the Fourth Ambition's hiding place.\n\nShe should arrive shortly. Let us meet her in the Plaza of Portals."
"3952276-1-8260";"The other survivors who came with me, they died when a Xivilai patrol found us. I'm the last of my clan. But I'm not stupid. I know going in alone only ends one way.\n\nJoin me. Help me get justice for clan Kalmur. And if we live, I can reward you."
"3952276-1-8261";"No? Oh, you're in disguise. I'm glad you're here. Saving Ordinator Nilera and Grandmother—Priest Sovisa's—spirits from Mehrunes Dagon? I can't do that alone! \n\nBut I can give you tribute, um, payment? For the help of an … adventurer."
"3952276-1-8263";"The Bladebearers are a Dremora clan who forge their own path. They have no allegiance to Mehrunes Dagon, so I find it curious that their crest was found on a broken sword in the keep.\n\nI want to determine their involvement. With your aid, of course."
"3952276-1-8264";"Always. With Rynkyus and his Bladebearers beside us, we will fight our way to the Riven Cataclyst. When I have seen what I need to, you can destroy the device.\n\nMeet us at the base of Annihilarch's Summit, provided you want to be a part of this."
"3952276-1-8266";"Fyna, a local merchant who's hoping to put a stop to the cult's recruitment drive. Whenever she sees anything she considers bad for businesses, she calls on the Gleaners. And then I call on adventurers like you. If you want to know more, talk to her."
"3952276-1-8267";"It's a building in the Deadlands that's controlled by the Waking Flame cult. Folks enter the building and don't leave. It stands to reason that their valuables are still there. Airlur loiters near Madam Whim's. Ask him if you're curious.\n\nSo, you in?"
"3952276-1-8268";"A junior thief named Glayamen was in the Folly and spotted valuables near the statues. He's probably sulking near Madam Whim's if you want to ask him what happened.\n\nYou interested in this job?"
"3952276-1-8269";"Have you ever been to the Folly? That place is terrifying. Tuleenith's stationed at the House of Whims if you have questions. All I can say is that if you take on this job, you get a cut of the deal. \n\nSo? What do you say? Want to do some gardening?"
"3952276-1-8270";"Oh! We marked the drop sites with Gleaners' gleam. It's an ink that only we can see. If you're curious, ask Pieron. He usually sets himself up in the crafting plaza.\n\nGo to the Blood Pit. Look for the gleam. Make the drops. Get paid. Easy!"
"3952276-1-8271";"We've had some trouble with fences lately. A thief got it into his head to steal from them and now they're going after any Gleaner they recognize. I need someone new to get these goods before someone else steals them.\n\nAre you in? You'll be paid."
"3952276-1-8278";"Unfortunately, my talents are better served here. These minstrels are worth your effort, though. Their music is out of this realm! And I always pay those who help me make Tamriel more decadent.\n\nSo? Will you help me improve this dreary festival?"
"3952276-1-8279";"Lyranth the Dremora. She sent me a letter. Said the cult threatened Fargrave. Nirn, too. She wanted my help, but I can't deal with that now. The votive runes are clearly the immediate danger.\n\nWe should work together on this. I can pay."
"3952276-1-8280";"I have heard of the infamous Mazken who calls herself Madam Whim. I find her practice of turning gossip into profit to be loathsome, but even a filthy daedrat has its uses, I suppose. Take the note to her and pay whatever it costs for a translation."
"3952276-1-8282";"There are other means of accruing wealth, obviously. But we don't want some Gleaner to beat us to the punch.\n\nIf you have questions about the treasure, ask Rayna yourself. She's always in the guild hall. We both know you'll leave well-paid though."
"3952276-1-8283";"The Unmaker is one of the strongest beings in the Deadlands. Even Dagon's Daedra go against it and lose! Plus, now it has help in the form of some Havocrel. That means abandoned armor for the picking. \n\nWe'll pay for what you retrieve. Interested?"
"3952276-1-8284";"Magical stones. They store information about what happens near where they're placed. Ask Vares if you're curious. He's tinkering away on something in the guild hall. \n\nAnd I have reports that the Unmaker has some Havocrel friends. Still interested?"
"3952276-1-8285";"This venom is also a key ingredient in a Daedric hypnotic called Daze. Verdam Sedri says Daze is cropping up in cheap mortal medicines from the Shambles. Why not deal with two issues?\n\nThe pay is good on this job. Don't complain."
"3952276-1-8286";"Destroy the rods—we have replacements—and kill Taupezu Azzida. It's gotten too annoying to live.\n\nI'd kill it myself—the pay is good—but I haven't been cleared by a healer. If you have questions, ask Ulvena in the guild hall."
"3952276-1-8289";"Here's a quick cordial. Give it to them. But don't just save the prisoners and come back for payment. \n\nNo, this job isn't done until you kill Taupezu Azzida and show those kyncursed cultists what happens when someone crosses the Saraathu Tong!"
"3952276-1-8292";"You must search the Sever for these criminals and bring them back to me. Their leader's name is Bakh. He went through the portal last, and therefore should be easy to find. \n\nHe is a cunning mortal, but he and the others cannot have gotten far."
"3952276-1-8293";"I may or may not have overheard a thing or two. Something about something you learned from some mad prisoner named Elegian? The Riven Cataclyst hidden atop Annihilarch's Summit?\n\nI suppose Lyranth wants you to assault the summit. Good luck with that!"
"3952276-1-8296";"Why can't I—? Look at me! I'm like a malnourished ferret! You though ….\n\nHow about this: if you bring me some solid tales about the wilds of Summerset, Vvardenfell, Clockwork City, and Artaeum, I'll cut you in on my earnings. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8298";"A legendary Xivilai warrior. Her crew took the location of their greatest treasure to Oblivion.\n\nBut one of their number just returned. Skoedal is in Wretched Spire. Get the portal's location from him, retrieve the treasure, and I'll reward you."
"3952276-1-8303";"Excellent! I just need tales. Confront a foul creature, investigate an abyssal geyser, do some sightseeing in Vvardenfell … oh, or find some interesting handicraft in Clockwork City!\n\nI'll meet you at the nearest Impresario camp afterward."
"3952276-1-8305";"I am the foremost authority on Daedric artifacts and the greatest mage of our era. So, yes, I'm quite confident they're trying to hide the weapon from me. A fool's errand.\n\nIf you choose to assist me in finding the blade, I will pay you handsomely."
"3952276-1-8306";"Some kind of diplomatic correspondence. A letter and a medallion. All I know is I'm being well paid to risk my neck for it, and you will be too. If you don't mind crossing these Ascendant Order troublemakers.\n\nSo, you in?"
"3952276-1-8308";"The one leading this band of miscreants is supposed to have once been a decorated Dominion leader known for his command of war gryphons.\n\nPlant the Undaunted banner before you turn him and his overgrown fowl into slaughterfish bait."
"3952276-1-8309";"Shh, shh, do not speak such ills and make them so! Za'ji has chased his tail up and down the coasts of High Rock searching for this shipyard of legend. What Za'ji desires is here, he can feel it in his whiskers and will wager a hunter's wages on it."
"3952276-1-8311";"We've heard a crew of Sea Elves are pillaging the old shipyard in spite of the rumors. Plant the Undaunted banner as a challenge to their captain and then knock the scaly bastard into the drink."
"3952276-1-8312";"I relay messages—directions are hardly my concern. But I imagine you'll find Lyranth in the private room above the House of Whims in Fargrave. \n\nWhy she allows the Dremora and her entourage to use it is beyond my comprehension."
"3952276-1-8313";"Out of sync with reality. I need to find a Daedra sage named Rrvenk, a master of the Eleventh Force: Change. He may be my best hope of escaping this synchroseisia. Maybe my only hope.\n\nWill you help me find Rrvenk? I'll compensate you once I'm whole."
"3952276-1-8314";"Fanatical followers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Disaster. While my mistress is merely curious, she has learned that the cult's plans pose a grave threat to the mortal world.\n\nWill you assist Lyranth? She will compensate you, of course."
"3952276-1-8315";"Oh, just a little something I like to refer to as the end of the mortal realm.\n\nYou do remember the Waking Flame? You may have momentarily put a stop to their plans, but unless you get that note deciphered, their ultimate goal remains a mystery."
"3952276-1-8316";"To me? No. But I can't help but hear when she and Madam Whim are talking. Lyranth seeks a place called Deadlight. Says the cult may have a stronghold there.\n\nA lot of fuss over an ancient legend, if you ask me."
"3952276-1-8317";"She said something about a portal key, but I'm not an expert on such relics. Madam Whim, however, adores studying the wretched things.\n\nIf I were you, I'd be worried about assaulting a mountain of fire. Sounds unhealthy to me. Now, go!"
"3952276-1-8325";"Me? Do? Oh, no. I plan to stay far away in case events do get violent. I have no wish to battle against Daedra!\n\nIf you want to help, speak to a Dremora named Noroth. I suspect he plans to hunt for the murderer and will pay a reward for assistance."
"3952276-1-8326";"I am a messenger, not a confidant. I am not privy to the details, but I heard talk of Leyawiin and a gathering of allies. If you wish to know more, I suggest you ask her yourself.\n\nI have much work to do for Madam Whim. It's time I return to it."
"3952276-1-8328";"Apologies, I'm not permitted to disclose that until you've proven yourself before Zenithar. Assist me in crafting an offering for the provider of ease, and I'll tell you about the awl.\n\nI'm willing to part with my hard-earned coin if you help me."
"3952276-1-8329";"Any of those labors will please the Provider of our Ease. But you do need to grab his attention. One of us just needs to pray to him. \n\nZenithar is generous, but there are many laborers here. We wouldn't want him to miss your deeds."
"3952276-1-8333";"People in my line of work tend to acquire various contacts. I put the word out and finally got one of mine to bite. I'm off to meet up with Tarazka now. \n\nSo, want to help me find Valessea and talk to my contact? You'll be paid, naturally."
"3952276-1-8335";"While tales of my exploits credit me with all sorts of talents, I can't be in more than one place at a time. I could use a fresh face to mingle with the locals. Determine if anyone knows anything about my three missing ships … and their cargo."
"3952276-1-8336";"Well, that's a lead we can investigate! I'd like to have a chat with Dockmaster Arnauld about that and a great many other things. I detest being lied to, and he did it with such conviction.\n\nYou're still on retainer, dear. Would you care to join me?"
"3952276-1-8337";"I'll leave that to you. Investigate all three and report back here.\n\nI'll send Jakarn to the docks, Captain Kaleen to the cave, and Valessea to the grove. Rendezvous with them at each location and see what you can uncover about our rogue knights."
"3952276-1-8338";"Molten rock. Cooled to a crust outside the vulk'esh's bodies. Tarrinore and I were hired to retrieve it, but the gold we were offered means nothing if Tarrinore dies!\n\nTraveler, I am willing to pay you hefty sums to ensure my wife's safety."
"3952276-1-8339";"Leobert caught me and threw my body from the ramparts. Once I crossed over the wall, the magic binding my body together dissipated.\n\nHelp me. Kneel at the altars. Ensure Leobert will never leave. Do this and the treasures of the graveyard are yours."
"3952276-1-8340";"Even if my Privette was just your typical sheep—which she is not—that would not excuse the Hadolids' rude behavior.\n\nI need someone strong to support my negotiations for Privette's return. How would you feel about joining me in exchange for coin?"
"3952276-1-8342";"A fair bit of gold, most likely. Lady Arabelle works for one of the richest nobles in all Tamriel—Lord Bacaro Volorus. He's sponsoring an important conference here on the island. But there's a problem.\n\nTrust me. The payday will be worth it."
"3952276-1-8344";"You want to treat with it, be my guest. I left it where I found it. Outside that ruin. The Death's Valor Keep—or maybe it was the Death Valor's Keep? Doesn't matter. I won't go near it or another grave again!"
"3952276-1-8345";"He and I? We're fast-talkers. Swindlers. We don't stick around long enough for the fighting. If he's still alive, he won't last.\n\nHey, come with me. I'll need the help. And you'll get some coin that I lifted off a jailer. I promise I won't cheat you."
"3952276-1-8346";"The Guilds are respected and influential in their own right. They deserve to be part of these negotiations. \n\nHere. Two medallions. And look, Arch-Magister Delric has just arrived. You can deliver the Mages Guild medallion to him first."
"3952276-1-8347";"Well, normally aspirants only compete in one of the trials. If I can win all three, the knight commander will be compelled to grant a boon of my choosing. I can free Aurelia from her mother's promise! \n\nWhat do you say? Will you be my second?"
"3952276-1-8348";"Oh no, that would be a slap in the face to her mother. And Aurelia's such a good girl.\n\nMore scandal. Her friend, Isobel, is a participant in the tourney! She's sworn to free Aurelia from her mother's promise! I can't wait to find out what happens!"
"3952276-1-8349";"One of my most famous ancestors vanished in Ghost Haven Bay along with her whole ship, crew, and treasure. I aim to find her fortune. Once I've got my family treasure, then you'll get your share of the bounty, first mate or no.\n\nWe have an agreement?"
"3952276-1-8350";"Yes … and I need you to rescue my partner. If she was captured, she'd be consigned to a life of brutal slavery.\n\nIf you rescue Nari and take care of the documents, I'll forfeit my finder's fee from the Dominion to you."
"3952276-1-8351";"I guess those two aren't the fighting type. Louna said they ended up here for swindling.\n\nIf you want a laugh, look for her on the western coast. Maybe she's built her trash raft by now. She might even offer you something to help her. Ha!"
"3952276-1-8352";"Aboard a prison ship. They sail for Amenos regularly from the Dufort Docks. We'll be contracting the services of Captain Basrush. She's a …  dear friend.\n\nJakarn and I will meet you there after I finish briefing Captain Kaleen and the others."
"3952276-1-8353";"Just the usual. She wants you back at Mandrake Manor so she can give you all the details.\n\nShe tends to keep things to herself, even after all this time. I'd be insulted that she doesn't trust me, but I know I can't actually be trusted. My one flaw."
"3952276-1-8354";"And I think I know how to determine where this assemblage will take place. While you were away, I received reports of Ascendant Order activity at Mistmouth Cave.\n\nI propose we investigate. And, if luck is with us, catch ourselves a Lord and a Magus."
"3952276-1-8355";"I suppose. I wasn't there. You and Irnskar heard it, not me.\n\nAnyway, Lady Arabelle has an idea about how to find out where this meeting will take place. She wants you to accompany her. What do you say? You in? She's still paying, so …."
"3952276-1-8356";"Remember Damard's letter to the steward? The Ascendant Order ship, Nereid's Song. It's waiting for the steward in a hidden cove. We just need to commandeer it and sail to All Flags like the rest of the ships in their fleet.\n\nCan I count on your help?"
"3952276-1-8357";"You know, I asked the very same question! \n\nLook, let's get back to Mandrake Manor. Lady Arabelle seems to tell you everything when you ask. So, you talk to her and then we can figure out a way to save the alliance leaders."
"3952276-1-8358";"To take the Sacred Shield without daring the Trials of Worth. But only one who passes the trials learns the words that dismiss the wards guarding the shield.\n\nIf you can win the shield before the necromancer steals it, I will reward you."
"3952276-1-8359";"She has a rather unique style of mentorship. However, I fear confronting the villain and utilizing my research may be difficult for one person to do alone.\n\nIf you're going to take the boat over, and I follow … surely she can't fault me for that."
"3952276-1-8360";"I counted the footprints. Enough for each of the prisoners and Veslyn. She's with them, mark my words. I just hope they're all right.\n\nGet Veslyn and those ne'er-do-wells out of the Coral Cliffs. House Mornard will see that you're compensated."
"3952276-1-8361";"Really, I just need another set of hands. Here, let me mark your map.\n\nI'll cast the cleansing spell, then you burn out the impurity. That will temporarily restore the balance while we search for the source. The circle will compensate you, of course."
"3952276-1-8362";"I need to develop a counterspell. But first, the protective wards around the area need to be restored by someone other than myself so I don't taint the magic.\n\nThat's where you come in. Like I said, if you help, I can pay!"
"3952276-1-8363";"The menders are busy tending to the afflicted. That's where you come in. If you find the cause, then they might better understand how to deal with it.\n\nI'll reward you for the effort. What we're doing here in Steadfast Manor is important."
"3952276-1-8364";"Steadfast Manor isn't just a hospice—it's a place of reconciliation. Lord Bacaro sees our work here as a means to end the war. \n\nPerhaps you could help with our problem? Surely you've solved mysteries before. We can reward you for your efforts."
"3952276-1-8365";"You probably skip right to the end of a book to see what happens, don't you?\n\nYeah, Lady Arabelle wants us to check out the sites. You, me, Captain Kaleen, and my beautiful Valessea. But she really wants to give you our marching orders personally."
"3952276-1-8366";"Oblan is as resourceful as he is crusty. I bet he left some way for me to find him.\n\nI could use a second set of eyes to search along Skulltooth Coast. Help me find Oblan and the Prowler. I have a few valuables on my ship that could be yours."
"3952276-1-8368";"The prisoners aren't villains. They don't ask for much and House Mornard employs father to give them what they need.\n\nLook, the mine's in trouble. Will you accompany me? I can pay and surely father can't say no—not with you there. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8371";"Yes! I went out with delegates <<1>> and <<2>> last night. We ate and drank like kings! I don't remember all that happened, but I spent most of my gold. And I lost my official scepter.\n\nWill you help me look for it? I can pay you. A little."
"3952276-1-8375";"On the prison island of Amenos? Hardly! Besides, there's no time. Here. Take this bottle of Dufort Red. It's a rare vintage that Jailer Omdil absolutely adores. Give him that and he'll let you inside.\n\nThen find my Valentyn and get him out of there!"
"3952276-1-8377";"I suspect Count Damard's defeat cost the Ascendant Order most of their strength. It will take time for them to recover—which gives us a chance to salvage the peace talks.\n\nBring the news to Lord Bacaro, then meet me back at Mandrake Manor."
"3952276-1-8378";"Where else? She's back at Mandrake Manor, waiting for you and probably thinking up some new menial tasks to occupy my time.\n\nI love her like my own grandmother, but I can't wait to be finished with this debt!"
"3952276-1-8380";"Once the Dufort Flotilla has engaged the Dreadsail fleet, this vessel will take you within striking distance of their island base.\n\nMake landfall, find Taleria, and subdue her before she can bring her magic to bear on our ships."
"3952276-1-8384";"I went out to find us a meal and when I got back, Jhaka, Silverslip, and Song were just gone. I've spent years trying to find any trace of them without any luck.\n\nBut I finally have a lead from a friend in Skywatch. I want you to come with me."
"3952276-1-8385";"Jhaka said we should wait until he knows something for sure, but I don't want to sit around.\n\nJhaka is in Marbruk, in Greenshade. I want to go there and talk to him. Maybe there's something we can do to expedite things. Come with me?"
"3952276-1-8386";"The man who wrote the letter is named Izbadd. I say we pay him a visit and figure out what this is all about. I don't want to risk Jhaka or Silverslip getting hurt. We're better equipped to deal with any threats. Izbadd's in Bangkorai. Will you come?"
"3952276-1-8388";"It's a signet ring representing my family's business, Veloise Mercantile. Someone wearing that ring could pretend they were working for my parents. That would be … bad.\n\nAurelia is on Stros M'Kai. If you don't mind … could we go speak with her?"
"3952276-1-8389";"You know I'm at your service. But it would mean the world to me if we could return to High Isle and speak with Dame Jourvel.\n\nIf she needs my help, I'd like to give it."
"3952276-1-8390";"Actually, it seems quite informal. Maybe Commander Jourvel heard from Aurelia?\n\nRemember, Aurelia and Marso had plans to investigate that conspiracy in Rivenspire. If there's been a development, we should head to Gonfalon as soon as we can."
"3952276-1-8394";"This treasure isn't riches, but it is my ticket back to Hammerfell. I'm willing to pay you a hefty sum of gold for that passage.\n\nSo what do you say? Partners?"
"3952276-1-8395";"Perish the thought, walker! Za'ji simply seeks designs to make the Perfect Pounce, even more … perfect! He's searched High Rock up and down for this storied shipyard. \n\nThis is where his treasure lies, he knows it! And spoils for us both."
"3952276-1-8398";"Well, usually I'm the one who stumbles into trouble, but this time m'lady found the old chest. It was so unlike her to open it herself, and that's when she activated the curse!\n\nI'll gladly give you my annual stipend if you help me save Lady Laurent!"
"3952276-1-8399";"Yes … and I need you to rescue my partner. If she was captured, she'd be consigned to a life of brutal slavery.\n\nIf you rescue Nari and take care of the documents, I'll forfeit my finder's fee from the Covenant to you."
"3952276-1-8400";"Yes … and I need you to rescue my partner. If she was captured, she'd be consigned to a life of brutal slavery.\n\nIf you rescue Nari and take care of the documents, I'll forfeit my finder's fee from the Pact to you."
"3952276-1-8403";"A sign that Zenithar desires the baked apples you made and a basket woven from my hands. The blessed awl has been stolen. But, I knew Zenithar would provide and here you are.\n\nWhat do you say? I'm sure Zenithar will reward you as he did before."
"3952276-1-8405";"She wants to know what you learned from the rescued captains. Compare their stories with what you and her have already discovered in your investigations.\n\nAnd she still has you on retainer, which means more gold in your pouch for your help."
"3952276-1-8406";"Ha! A fresh player! Excellent!\n\nFirst things first. You need to learn the rules of the game. And you'll need a couple of decks of Tribute cards, of course. Find Razhamad in the Gonfalon Gaming Hall. Tell him Brahgas sent you. He'll get you sorted."
"3952276-1-8407";"Ha! Hooked another one!\n\nIf you want to learn the game, you should travel to Gonfalon Bay on High Isle and talk to my friend Brahgas. You'll find him at the city gaming hall. He'll get you sorted. I wish you safe travels and good luck in the game!"
"3952276-1-8411";"Same as last time. Gold and my undying gratitude. Plus, it will help me work off my debt to Lady Arabelle.\n\nSo what do you say, my friend? Ready to assist your best partner and favorite ally again? For old time's sake?"
"3952276-1-8412";"The Eldertide theurges are searching for geodes that focus the natural magicka of the earth. Lord Felipe wants someone to deal with them and bring back any geodes they've found. He's here in town, if you need to know more.\n\nWhat do you say?"
"3952276-1-8413";"As in all things, the best way to improve is through doing! Set out and find new opponents. Win or lose, your skills will grow and your strategies will sharpen.\n\nOnce you establish yourself in the beginner's circuit, return to me for a reward!"
"3952276-1-8414";"Gather the skulls of the fallen knights and bring them to me. I'll make sure they get to Sir Charles for a proper burial. If you have more questions, Sir Charles can be found at the temple here in the city.\n\nCan I put you down for this job?"
"3952276-1-8415";"You will play several matches. If you defeat enough of the opposing chapter's players, you may face off against their chief novice. A worthy opponent, to be sure.\n\nNow, gather with the others in the beginner's lounge. The first game draws near!"
"3952276-1-8416";"The Sable Knight leaves necromantic energy wherever it goes. You'll need cleansing water to dispel the dark pools in the Knight's area. Fortunately, Priestess Nyrona at the temple gave me a vial. She can tell you more about it.\n\nStill interested?"
"3952276-1-8417";"Wildhorn's most recent victims were minor nobles. If you find their remains, bring back their signet rings. Cold comfort for the families, but better than nothing.\n\nThe nobles' guide, a hunter named Marwig, can tell you more. He's by the docks."
"3952276-1-8418";"Take this and sprinkle some of its contents on lava pools inside the Firepot. Then return here and you get paid. Simple as that. If you need more information, you can find <<1>> in the Mages Guild here in town.\n\nSo, can I count on you for this?"
"3952276-1-8421";"Get to the active volcanic vent and disrupt the activity there, it will buy us time. But be careful, there are many molten beasts crawling all over the place. You'll need a group to get through them.\n\nWhat do you say? I'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8423";"We need three ingredients to make another batch, and Hilgrim's in no state to get them himself. The drink requires fleshflies, a Systres passion flower, and a druid's bane mushroom. If I marked the locations on your map, would you gather them for us?"
"3952276-1-8424";"Aquatic creatures of an ill nature. Unpleasant. Suppose that's why they'd rather destroy the supplies than have them returned. But Borzadar is at the Ancient Anchor Inn if you want more details.\n\nCan I count on you for this task?"
"3952276-1-8425";"Not quite. The druids also asked us to retrieve the serpent eggs that Vinsha is altering with her magic. Bring them back here, and try not to drop any. \n\nIf you have any other questions, seek out a druid named Farel. He's in Gonfalon Square."
"3952276-1-8429";"Go to Whalefall, determine if she's right, and bring back evidence of the prisoners sent there. If we can start compiling a list of the prisoners and match it to those missing, that will help a lot.\n\nAnything else, talk to Advocate Inwaldawin."
"3952276-1-8432";"Defeat the Ascendant Executioner and the Ascendant Harrower, and free any prisoners they're tormenting. If you need a firsthand account of their wicked dealings, there's a survivor named Cienne recovering down by the temple."
"3952276-1-8433";"There's a Hadolid molting ground south of Coral Cliffs on Amenos. Be careful—it's guarded by a fierce matron. You'll have to kill her to procure the glands. Anyway, you can find Bethes Romavel in the crafting hall if you want to know more."
"3952276-1-8434";"Head back to the Gonfalon Bay Gaming Hall and meet up with Master Razhamad. He's assembling all the novices and finalizing the competitors list. He'll tell you what to do.\n\nSee you there!"
"3952276-1-8436";"I hope so. A letter addressed to her arrived yesterday. She seemed deeply troubled after reading it. I offered an ear to listen, but she insisted she would be fine and left. Now, I am not so sure.\n\nSorinne clearly likes you. Would you speak to her?"
"3952276-1-8437";"Go to Shipwreck Shoals on the northeast coast of High Isle. The pirates there have absconded with the crates of uniforms. Find the crates and burn them.\n\nIf you want more information, seek out the agent at the Fighters Guild. His name is Levus Cavus."
"3952276-1-8438";"Oh yes. Especially to anyone who doesn't bend to their traditions and beliefs. Nivathil is researching druidic magic for the Mages Guild. So anything you find will help with her studies.\n\nShe's at the Ancient Anchor Inn if you have more questions."
"3952276-1-8439";"Get to the active volcanic vent and disrupt the activity there, it will buy us time. But be careful, there are many molten beasts crawling all over the place. You'll need a group to get through them.\n\nWhat do you say? I'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8443";"If you overcome the opposing chapter, you will need to defeat all remaining players for the title. That means the Gonfalon Chapter—your teammates—may have to challenge each other.\n\nWith how well the three of you have played … just be ready."
"3952276-1-8452";"No, not that I've ever seen! And I take that shortcut almost every day. The magister who lives there and his Khajiit assistant, Ember, are nice enough. I hope they're all right. But I'm not crazy enough to go back. You look brave. Maybe you could?"
"3952276-1-8453";"I'm tracking several scions of the Host, in hopes to find one vampire in particular. They will all be ash when I am through.\n\nWill you join the hunt? I've had a few close calls. I wouldn't turn away an able adventurer such as yourself."
"3952276-1-8454";"He's after the Stonelore's sacred seed. I'm sure he knew we wouldn't tell him where it was—his followers didn't even hesitate to attack.\n\nThat burnt crust Archdruid Devyric can't win. Stop him. I'll pay if that's what you need to convince you."
"3952276-1-8456";"The leader of the invading druids is called Devyric. Rumors say he's a real bear of a leader with the strength and ego to match. Plant our banner before you take him out. That'll put him in his place."
"3952276-1-8457";"Mate, you mean how will we learn that? Landing on this island bound our fates.\n\nWe'll scour this island for clues. Whatever raised that storm must be obvious. Keep whatever else you find as payment. Once satisfied, we can leave on this raft I made."
"3952276-1-8459";"Those old ghost stories might scare cowardly pirates, but not you, huh?\n\nIf that island does have undead crawling on it, then they probably have a master. Find him. Then raise the Undaunted banner before you bury him in the deep sea."
"3952276-1-8460";"Even if my Privette was just your typical sheep—which she is not—that would not excuse the Hadolids' rude behavior.\n\nI need someone strong to support my negotiations for Privette's return. How would you feel about joining me in exchange for coin?"
"3952276-1-8461";"By advertising, of course! I'm drafting a pamphlet describing the tours of the isles. Publish it in cities across Tamriel to attract visitors. \n\nWhat I need at the moment is someone to test my suggested itinerary. Interested? I'll pay for your time."
"3952276-1-8465";"I'm a historian. Dhulef's helping me trace the movements of the druids of Galen after they left High Rock in ages past. I'm not familiar with this land, so Dhulef went on ahead. Now he's in trouble. Can you help? I'll find a way to reward you."
"3952276-1-8466";"A mission most intriguing, yes! The pirate captain Redblade seeks to raise an armada. Only Raz's sharp wits and sharper claws can stop this.\n\nSo, this one asks a favor. Distract the thugs so Raz might slip out the side door. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8467";"Magic, I assume. I noticed crystals drawing energy from the lava. But what do I know about magic? Druids are mysterious.\n\nHey, will you help me? If we stop them from opening more fissures, I can finish my work. I'd pay for your labor, naturally."
"3952276-1-8469";"They are a proud and fickle lot, but they have one thing in common, dear. They respect you.\n\nGo to the city palace and talk to them. Ask them to remain patient. Then speak to Lord Bacaro. See if you can convince him to let me get things started."
"3952276-1-8470";"Druid Ryvana and I will get Za'ji to sail us to Galen. While we collect the staff from the Stonelore Circle, I want you to go to Count Stefan and protect the Druid King's crown.\n\nWe'll meet you at Castle Mornard as soon as we can."
"3952276-1-8471";"She said, ""Za'ji, I have urgent matters to discuss with our friend. Go find them, dear, and tell them to come talk to me at Mandrake Manor."" That's exactly how she said it.\n\nAsk Caska! She heard it, too!"
"3952276-1-8473";"While Archdruid Orlaith sees my knights doing what she demanded—nothing!—I want you to find Stefan and set him free. Dhulef says the Stonelore and Eldertide archdruids are here in the city. Get them to tell you where Stefan is being held."
"3952276-1-8474";"Some quarrel among the circles. Never seen the druids so at odds before.\n\nBut if you're willing to help, go talk to the count's son, Sir Stefan. He's just outside Vastyr, leading the effort to drive off the Sea Elves. What do you say, sailor?"
"3952276-1-8476";"Three trials. First, you must retrieve a piece of vital Draconic knowledge. Second, test your combat prowess by securing a Defense Force standard from the depths of a dungeon. Finally, you must present to me a fresh Dragon heart.\n\nAre you interested?"
"3952276-1-8477";"She told us as the cathedral collapsed. She's going to proclaim herself the new Druid King. But while she has the seeds, she still needs the Sower.\n\nFrii has a part to play in all this, but they'll need your help. Find them, friend. Keep them safe."
"3952276-1-8478";"We land on the far side of the island with my knights and free my people while Orlaith conducts her ritual.\n\nI'll arrange passage to Y'ffelon. Find Frii and get them to agree to the plan, then meet me at the docks. You'll be well rewarded, friend."
"3952276-1-8479";"Well, like usual, Lady Arabelle doesn't trust Za'ji with the finer details. I think she wants to sail to Galen? She will tell you herself. She tells you everything. Za'ji, not so much. Meet back at Mandrake Manor and we will find out together."
"3952276-1-8480";"Look at him! We have to break the curse. Druid Fenas is trying to figure out what that entails, but he can't do it alone. I'm covered in bark and Octin's got no body. We could really use some help. Don't make me beg. \n\nPlease."
"3952276-1-8481";"Possibly. But more to the point, I want you to warn Count Stefan and secure the aid of House Mornard. Sail to Vastyr and meet with the count. Let him know what transpired here and get him to agree to aid us when the order appears again."
"3952276-1-8484";"While I help my father prepare the city's defenses, I want you to find the archdruids and secure their assistance. In exchange, they'll gain a place to protect their wounded and their seeds. Start with Archdruid Rahval of the Stonelore Circle."
"3952276-1-8486";"Indeed. You must recover a piece of lost knowledge, claim a Defense Force banner left in one of Elsweyr's dungeons and bring me back a fresh Dragon heart. \n\nAre you ready to show what an Elsweyr Defense Conference veteran is made of?"
"3952276-1-8488";"He knows something about the relic but wouldn't share. I can't look for him and also search the camp. I'd need two … of … me.\n\nSay. Would you like to help? With both of us, we could do this. You can keep whatever you find—aside from the relic."
"3952276-1-8489";"The Spirit of Y'ffre's Path. We call it the Chronicle. We Eldertide made our home here to care for and tend to the spirit.\n\nOutsider, I'm trusting you. I'm putting my wife's safety in your hands. Help me find her and I will see you well rewarded."
"3952276-1-8490";"Specifically, she requested I send you to help her. She'll meet you on the Castle Tonnere docks, on the western shore. Do whatever you need to, but make sure she recovers her ship. We need the Gilded Blades when the assault on Vastyr begins."
"3952276-1-8491";"Aye. We ran afoul of some Dreadsails while searching for the damn treasure. Kiko and I were the only survivors. \n\nLook, I want to find that treasure and avenge my crew, but I've no mind for riddles. Help me out, and I'll make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8493";"No! Definitely not. I want someone to take these fast-growing seeds and plant them throughout Fauns' Thicket. Fauns love the taste of the berries but wolves can't stand them.\n\nI can offer a reward if you're inclined to assist me."
"3952276-1-8509";"The size of the sunflowers may be due to the wraith's presence, but who's to say? The point is, the wraith is dangerous and needs to go.\n\nAnd someone in House Mornard wants a sample of these massive sunflowers for … personal purposes. Can you help?"
"3952276-1-8513";"Precisely! Nothing more exciting than small, glowing rocks. Very exotic! They will sell like sweetrolls! Or hot cakes. Or hot rocks, I guess.\n\nA nice man named Filimor Vette was telling me all about them. He seemed very excited. Now I am too!"
"3952276-1-8514";"Please, go to Embervine and sketch its wonders. Drawings of the cave features, lava flows, and jungles will help convince patrons that Savage Systres Tours can show them sights they've never seen before!\n\nWhat do you say?"
"3952276-1-8515";"My friend Meshden said that placing lures near wispleaf blooms would do the trick. He told me all about Fauns' Thicket, but he refuses to go in. Poor fellow must be scared of those adorable critters.\n\nI have the lures. Are you willing to go?"
"3952276-1-8516";"Go to Fauns' Thicket and collect blossoms of kingsblood. Druid Yrene of the Stonelore Circle says the ones that grow there are the finest examples in Galen. They would be lovely for tour patrons who simply admire beauty!\n\nAre you interested?"
"3952276-1-8517";"That's what makes it exciting! A captain named Dervalas tells me we can find Sea Elves in Llanshara, a settlement in northeast Galen. I need you to go there and post these handbills promising a job to any Sea Elf who steps forward.\n\nInterested?"
"3952276-1-8518";"A knight named Sir Aval—oh, so handsome!—warned me of the area's dangers. I have the perfect solution: trail markers! Just place them along the route and it should be safe as can be.\n\nI'll work out a deal with the Eldertide Druids later."
"3952276-1-8524";"Head to the Valley of the Watcher. The captives are bound in roots that feed off their life essence, but this tincture should weaken them enough to slough right off. \n\nAnd don't forget, you'll still need to contend with the hostile wraith!"
"3952276-1-8525";"My friend Druid Calysa has an interest in studying the moths that have emerged near the Valley of the Watcher. Unfortunately, the place is haunted by a dangerous forest wraith. What do you say to taking care of both the wraith and Calysa's request?"
"3952276-1-8526";"You'll need to dispose of the chimera after recovering the relics. It pains me to ask that, but we have no other choice.\n\nBut the Firesong got this far on account of their numbers. You'd do well to work with a group and drive them back!"
"3952276-1-8527";"Our healers can prepare a treatment with an alchemical component taken from each head.\n\nThere's no telling what condition the chimera will be in when you and your group defeat it, so search the grove for sheddings instead. Understood?"
"3952276-1-8528";"Its rampage destroyed Stonelore shrines specifically meant to protect Vastyr. The Firesong moved in, and now the creature is under their control.\n\nWe're hoping someone can get a group to defeat it and restore the shrines. Is that someone you?"
"3952276-1-8529";"I'll let her give you the details. I will say this, though. You've certainly made an impression on the Stonelore Druids, dear."
"3952276-1-8531";"Glimmertarn. He planned to meet up with you there. Hurry and you should catch him.\n\nJust get both of your arses back here as quick as you can. I have a feeling we're going to have Dreadsails and Firesongs knocking on the walls shortly."
"3952276-1-8534";"Go in there and contain the source. But these are Telvanni. They guard their secrets jealously.\n\nI'd like your help. For pay, of course. And, since they know us already, it seems we're predestined to work together anyway."
"3952276-1-8536";"The leader of those arrogant spellslingers has a reputation for abusing powerful artifacts. No matter the consequences.\n\nRaise the Undaunted banner, then show her what time it really is."
"3952276-1-8538";"Then you know more about the situation than I do, mate. He did say something about druids and defending the city, though.\n\nAnyway, Sir Stefan's waiting for you at Castle Mornard. I'll meet you there."
"3952276-1-8539";"Grab a group of competent adventurers and head to the active volcanic vent. Once there, confront the molten beasts in the area and keep the vent from erupting. Easier said than done, of course.\n\nWill you help? The Stonelore Circle will pay."
"3952276-1-8541";"Some quarrel among the circles. Never seen the druids so at odds before.\n\nBut if you're willing to help, go talk to the count's son, Sir Stefan. He's just outside Vastyr, leading the effort to drive off the Sea Elves. What do you say, sailor?"
"3952276-1-8542";"Grab a group of competent adventurers and head to the active volcanic vent. Once there, confront the molten beasts in the area and keep the vent from erupting. Easier said than done, of course.\n\nWill you help? The Stonelore Circle will pay."
"3952276-1-8546";"I'm planning a fork-tender vulk'esh rib eye, deglazed with brandy for a nice pan sauce. All topped with blistered volcanic reaper peppers for a fiery kick.\n\nWhile I cater to the crowd, I need someone to source those ingredients. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8547";"We had a house together in Vastyr. If I know Frelene, she'll still be waiting at the docks night and day for my return. She has the loveliest brown hair and eyes like sea glass. You can't miss her.\n\nBring her the ring and tell her I'm at peace."
"3952276-1-8548";"Again, the count doesn't explain more than what's necessary. I was told to find you and that's what I've done. I do get the sense that the count has been impressed by you so far. If a rescue mission is in the cards, I'd say he'd want you to lead it."
"3952276-1-8607";"Aye, and that complicates things. Y'ffelon is the Firesong stronghold. Even if we weren't still recovering from the siege of Vastyr, we'd be hard pressed to fight them on their own island.\n\nMeet us at the castle and we can discuss this."
"3952276-1-8609";"Some quarrel among the circles. Never seen the druids so at odds before.\n\nBut if you're willing to help, go talk to the count's son, Sir Stefan. He's just outside Vastyr, leading the effort to drive off the Sea Elves. What do you say, sailor?"
"3952276-1-8610";"I want you to help preserve the realm of Apocrypha to keep the reality of Nirn from unraveling. At this particular moment, in this specific instance, the fates of both realms are inextricably linked. Will you do as the Prince asks and assist me?"
"3952276-1-8614";"Only a mortal proxy can deal with the threat and save both Apocrypha and Nirn. The fates of both realms are linked, and you are the key to preserving reality. Without you, everything unravels.\n\nHelp avert this disaster and Mora will reward you."
"3952276-1-8615";"Prelate Faram arrived from the Temple and suddenly my fellow monks fell ill. We were never notified of a visit and besides, Faram isn't our usual prelate. Never even heard of him.\n\nIf you can help, I can make sure you're compensated. I think."
"3952276-1-8616";"I never said it was more important. Just that fate requires both of us here. More than that, we shall need to determine.\n\nI do sense a lingering presence. A connection to Apocrypha. Help me investigate this place and Hermaeus Mora will reward you."
"3952276-1-8617";"Something here undermines a fate recorded by Hermaeus Mora. Likely foolish mortals trying to change what has already been written. To fix this, I could use some help.\n\nHmm. It's common knowledge that mortals prize gold. Aid me and I'll give you some."
"3952276-1-8618";"We go to Apocrypha. The stacks of Cipher's Midden contain the most extensive collections of tomes and treatises in all the known realms. If answers to our questions exist, we will find them there.\n\nWill you continue to aid me in this endeavor?"
"3952276-1-8619";"Yes, most puzzling.\n\nTorvesard's next step must involve the rite Master Shelreni seeks to draw from Meln's Black Book. Return to Necrom and find Curate Gadayn. See what Shelreni is up to. Meanwhile, I have other inquiries I wish to explore."
"3952276-1-8620";"Necrom. One of the first threads of fate we investigated to uncover the identity of Apocrypha's enemies. And, it is the only one we did not resolve. We must accompany Gadayn back there so he can return the Fulcrum Obscura.\n\nBut first, talk to Scruut."
"3952276-1-8621";"Please, this isn't the first worker's strike I've negotiated. Wait. You don't think something dangerous happened here, do you?\n\nWell, I have expense funds for this assignment. Might I hire you as a bodyguard while I perform my audit?"
"3952276-1-8622";"You're a distraction and a secondary measure. We cannot let either Luaffyn or the soldiers remain in their current positions. Free the soldiers and do something to draw out Luaffyn. Sound an alarm, make noise, but leave the kill to me."
"3952276-1-8623";"The scrolls give off a maddening aura. Sabinius left several hidden in the Wind. We need to destroy them, and make sure Sabinius has no more.\n\nThe Hush will take me if I go back. But an outsider like you should be able to resist. Can you help me?"
"3952276-1-8624";"Before you came along Vorm spat this note at me. ""The family's favorites, V."" My guess? We go into the library and find our family's three favorite books. \n\nHe's got to have something up his parchment sleeves. Something that can change him back."
"3952276-1-8625";"I need to find my father and my ship. When I last saw him, he was at the wheel, clutching his treasured belongings—a locket, a spyglass, and the ship's logbook. Our ship must have run aground. We need to find him!"
"3952276-1-8626";"Why else would the Eye-of-All place you here, now? Be certain, the Remnants reward service.\n\nA simple task—recover the relics before the Dremnaken find them. Close the beasts' entry portals. Then activate the Apogee's protective wards. Help us."
"3952276-1-8627";"I turned my ankle. Serves me right for wearing these new boots on an assignment without properly breaking them in.\n\nCould you find Solni Nrayn in Necrom and deliver her package for me? Happy to let you keep the reward, if it means I'll keep my job."
"3952276-1-8628";"I need the musk gland of a bull netch—I spotted some netch remains around Kemel-Ze. Also, a plant called the volcanic stinkhorn, from near Sailenmora. And lastly, fungal blooms from a dead shroom beetle. The best ones skitter around Tel Dreloth."
"3952276-1-8633";"Better you don't know. But … fine. There's a spy among the Assembly of Masters. My contact's here to end the threat.\n\nLook, can you take this letter to her? Don't open it. Don't look at it. Don't talk about it. Hand it over and you're done. Deal?"
"3952276-1-8634";"Hmm. An opportunity, perhaps? It shall take Vaermina time to locate the remaining glyphics. That gives us a chance to end the corruption and restore Hermaeus Mora's power.\n\nAre you willing to hunt down Blightcrown while I try to locate Vaermina?"
"3952276-1-8635";"Long ago we locked the pact in a space named the Crux. If the Dreamcarvers breach it, the power our lord granted us becomes theirs.\n\nThe Remnants are hobbled. A shadow of our former selves. We need help. Purge the invaders and we shall reward you."
"3952276-1-8636";"Mercenaries who steal magical items. Kemel-Ze holds Dwarven technology and the Magician's experiments. It's a banquet for their vile appetites.\n\nPlease talk to Nilphas Drethan and remove the Painted Eye from Kemel-Ze. The Tribunal will reward you."
"3952276-1-8637";"Simple! Cipher Frielvi. She'll know a way. She might be alive. But, she won't be easy to find. No no no! The bristleback lords won't let us through. And Dreamcarvers! Yech!\n\nIt'll be worth it, though! Help me find Frielvi. She'll give you a treat."
"3952276-1-8638";"The faulty vessels destabilized the entire apparatus—dislodging focus crystals, warping valves, and prompting leaks throughout the system!\n\nHuzmargo needs someone to protect his backside and make repairs. You would take Nirni-gold as payment, yes?"
"3952276-1-8639";"They would just kick me again. I'd need help. You could help! Mortals like gold, right? I have some.\n\nWe'll find the Voidprowlers and then you'll take the secret. Maybe kick them back? Then you can keep Hezehk safe while we finish my job."
"3952276-1-8640";"You would be saving the scales of this cipher, I assure you.\n\nMy name is Meenai-Shai and I know the Cloisters like the back of my claw. I can navigate us through its halls easily enough. Just meet me in the main hall and we can set out from there."
"3952276-1-8641";"Stand in for me at the shrine and the Khajiit caravan nearby. Ask questions, search for any clues or suspicious activity, and assure the high priest that I have everything under control.\n\nHelp me, and I'll make sure you're compensated for your time."
"3952276-1-8642";"If she's holding him against his will, he'll be in the isolation tower. The only access is through the lab in the caverns that run underneath. There's a key in the top floor of the main tower.\n\nPlease, can you help me? I'll pay for your assistance."
"3952276-1-8656";"Bastion Nymic is inaccessible except by a few ancient gates. The Herald's Seekers guard the way in. If you kill these Seekers and take their Daedric ichor, you can use it to activate the gate and get inside.\n\nAre you willing to help?"
"3952276-1-8658";"Nonsense! Oh, there is something to be said about the sharing of knowledge and the marketplace of ideas, but that's neither here nor there. Let's just say there is a tidy sum to be earned by an adventurer who can handle a delicate task."
"3952276-1-8659";"The forges of Underweave are a dangerous place. Ogle was made for watching and studying, not fighting. But you seem resilient. Help me find my master's fated glyphic, and I'll be sure to make it worth your while!"
"3952276-1-8660";"More like gather information. And if you're offering, I can pay you.\n\nHarn usually holds court in the Outlaws Refuge. He'll be the only one there with bodyguards. Ask him if Reynila Treviri's been through recently. Got it?"
"3952276-1-8661";"He has this little place in Sadrith Mora. If he's there, we can shake him down for information, then get lost before the Reformer's mercenaries show up.\n\nWhatever happens, I know I'll fare better with you there. Any chance you'd like to tag along?"
"3952276-1-8662";"No idea. But I was thinking—what if she could give us information on where we can find the Reformer? She must know something about where he's hiding. Something that could help us track him down.\n\nI agreed to meet with her. Will you come with?"
"3952276-1-8663";"It wasn't a long list. After the Reformer took Dimik-ei, I was reluctant to ask anyone in the first place. \n\nBut Mevei's found a new lead, and she said we'll need to act on it quickly. Are you still with me on this?"
"3952276-1-8664";"Martina was a brilliant collaborator, and may be able to identify where I went wrong. To find her we'll need to find a tome, summon a Daedra, and brave the terrors of Apocrypha!\n\nWhat do you say? Join me in an exploration into the unknown?"
"3952276-1-8665";"More than that, I have a revelation! Let's away to my sanctum sanctorum. It lies at the heart of Skywatch in Auridon. \n\nThere we can scry for a new destination, improve the Key, and put my research into action!"
"3952276-1-8666";"I want to ignore it and hope it goes away, but what works for toothaches may not hold true for extra-temporal phenomena.\n\nLet's continue our work on the Fateweaver key. To the Skywatch sanctum! We can scry for frayed fates, and gather supplies."
"3952276-1-8667";"The contents of the palimpsest are unique to every reader. By reading the text, I can discover the anchors that bind the adversary to me. The first step in destroying him.\n\nWhat do you say? Ready to end this experiment?"
"3952276-1-8668";"Blightcrown and Torvesard have ways to avoid detection. Only one viable option presents itself. We must ask Master Shelreni where Vaermina has taken her body.\n\nWill you see this through, proxy? Before the disaster Mora foresaw comes to pass?"
"3952276-1-8671";"Find a way to spill the wind from Orlaith's sails while we're piecing things together here. Maybe even steal the seeds back. Sir Stefan can tell you more. And I'm sure he'll pay you as well as his father did. Maybe better.\n\nWhat do you say?"
"3952276-1-8672";"A means of safe return from all the planes of Oblivion and the symbol of leadership for the scribes. Recovering the Itinerant Staff will rip the scribes from the grasp of the false Magnastylus, Valinna. Keshargo will see you rewarded for your help."
"3952276-1-8674";"They call themselves the Scribes of Mora. Sounds pretty dull to me. Their new leader, Valinna, thinks she's important just because she has friends in high places. If you want to deflate her ego, plant the banner. Show her what real power is."
"3952276-1-8675";"I didn't stay long enough to find out. Apparently, it's an honor just to be in its mere presence. Didn't feel like anything special to me.\n\nIf you're headed that way, maybe you can see what all the fuss is about."
"3952276-1-8677";"No. My portal spell needs retuning. But my creatures. Their majesty is wasted here, and I can't deprive Fargrave of my show. Also, they tend to be rather destructive.\n\nMortal, retrieve my five creatures and I can provide you with treats."
"3952276-1-8678";"Only a mortal proxy can deal with the threat and save both Apocrypha and Nirn. The fates of both realms are linked, and you are the key to preserving reality. Without you, everything unravels.\n\nHelp avert this disaster and Mora will reward you."
"3952276-1-8679";"Only a mortal proxy can deal with the threat and save both Apocrypha and Nirn. The fates of both realms are linked, and you are the key to preserving reality. Without you, everything unravels.\n\nHelp avert this disaster and Mora will reward you."
"3952276-1-8681";"We secured the pact inside a space called the Crux. Should the Dreamcarvers enter this space, our gifts become theirs to steal.\n\nMortal, the invaders cannot gain these powers. Help us purge them from the Cenotaph. We reward aid when given."
"3952276-1-8684";"I see patience isn't one of your strong suits.\n\nLeramil is ready to engage in further research concerning the relic, the rite, and the dream that the followers of Vaermina and Peryite seek. She wants you to meet her at the ruined bookshop in Necrom."
"3952276-1-8685";"I didn't catch her name, though she did look oddly familiar. She was heading right for the study, calm as could be. I tried to warn her, as I'm warning you now, but she just laughed! Acted like I was some sort of blubbering child!\n\nThe nerve!"
"3952276-1-8689";"Ansuul can use Vanton's magical power to enter this realm. She must not succeed, but she's very strong. You will need many friends to defeat her.\n\nAre you willing to journey into Vanton's mind and stop Ansuul? The Mages Guild will be in your debt."
"3952276-1-8692";"Not yet. But if we don't stop it, one of Vaermina's nightmare Daedra could manifest in our world.\n\nThis portal leads to Warlock Vanton's Tower, the focus of the threat. Do you know other warriors? Gather them. This will be exceedingly dangerous."
"3952276-1-8693";"You do not understand the value of these eggs here in Necrom. We value Anchre Mine eggs as a delicacy and export tithes fund many of the Temple's activities here. We cannot delay our shipments by a single day. \n\nWill you retrieve the eggs?"
"3952276-1-8694";"Regrettably, corruption runs deep among many Great Houses. Embroiling ourselves in black market dealings often leads to political strife better settled by bureaucrats and the Morag Tong. \n\nNo, you will be the quiet instrument of the Tribunal's will."
"3952276-1-8695";"He demands an unblemished page of dark parchment, a spool of skein-silk thread, an unopened vial of seeker ink, and pristine lurker leather. Items to make a book, I suppose.\n\nCollect these items and return them to me. I'll see your success rewarded."
"3952276-1-8696";"Exactly. From what I've gathered, the books this apostate scribe stole are currently in the Disquiet Study in Apocrypha. Bring me the books and I'll see that they're safely secured.\n\nDo all this and I'll see you well-rewarded."
"3952276-1-8697";"According to my reports, great numbers of Dremnaken reside within the Apogee of the Tormenting Eye in Apocrypha. \n\nReturn with … shall we say, three perfect teeth. The Ordinators will appreciate your efforts."
"3952276-1-8698";"Our divinations in this world have proved fruitless.\n\nComb the shores of Fathoms Drift and bring back any ship manifests you find. We can at least determine what ships the Master of the Tides of Fate has taken. We will make the trip worth your while."
"3952276-1-8699";"We'd like someone to avenge these ambitious Armigers. Defeat Vro-Kuul-Sha and collect the personal effects of Vivec's devoted warriors so they may be properly honored."
"3952276-1-8700";"It is a Daedric Prince's dreams made manifest, which escaped into our world.\n\nCan you defeat this creature and recover the scholar's research notes? You may need to bring others to help, but you'll be well-compensated for your efforts."
"3952276-1-8701";"Yes. A powerful Dremora like Dek operating in Apocrypha merits our interest. But Dek is crafty, and captured our agents. I hope they're still alive.\n\nFair warning: even a warrior of your stature may struggle to best him. You should bring allies."
"3952276-1-8702";"This Prime Cataloger has tomeshells that cling to it like leeches. If you can defeat the Prime Cataloger, and gather up the molted husks of these tomeshells, we could discover more about the library's contents. \n\nWhat do you say?"
"3952276-1-8703";"Yes. We want to curtail his growing power, but also understand his abilities. You and your allies will need to gather arcane residue from the warriors he's defeated. I have a device you can use to gather this residue.\n\nMay the Three guide your hand."
"3952276-1-8704";"Sotha Sil, the Light of Knowledge, provided our order with clockwork oddities we call mystic trackers. We need someone to defeat Corlys and place these trackers on his wagons to uncover his contacts."
"3952276-1-8706";"I'll find and contain the distortion's source. But the Telvanni will give resistance. If you could help a fellow monk, I'd feel grateful. I can pay for your time.\n\nSince they recognized us, it seems we're predestined to work together anyway."
"3952276-1-8707";"Not really. She's waiting for you in Cipher's Midden.\n\nThere's still a lot to do to save reality. Vaermina's still hiding in Master Shelreni's body. Blightcrown continues to spread corruption. And Torvesard … I can't really figure that one out."
"3952276-1-8714";"Find Akacirn and prevent him from completing the Numinous Rite. Reason with him if you can, but deal with him as you must. I suggest you begin by searching his dwelling for clues to his whereabouts. \n\nCan you help? I would be in your debt."
"3952276-1-8720";"Bastion Nymic is inaccessible except by a few ancient gates. The Herald's Seekers guard the way in. If you kill these Seekers and take their Daedric ichor, you can use it to activate the gate and get inside.\n\nAre you willing to help?"
"3952276-1-8721";"Bastion Nymic is inaccessible except by a few ancient gates. The Herald's Seekers guard the way in. If you kill these Seekers and take their Daedric ichor, you can use it to activate the gate and get inside.\n\nAre you willing to help?"
"3952276-1-8722";"Bastion Nymic is inaccessible except by a few ancient gates. The Herald's Seekers guard the way in. If you kill these Seekers and take their Daedric ichor, you can use it to activate the gate and get inside.\n\nAre you willing to help?"
"3952276-1-8723";"I have no idea! This is beyond even my extensive experience repairing the frayed threads of destiny!\n\nLeramil wants to talk to you, though. Return to the Necrom Bindery and consult with her. Then do what fate requires and put reality to rights!"
"3952276-1-8726";"I never found out. I stumbled upon a group of Daedric cultists and realized something really bad was going on there. I ran and never looked back.\n\nI told the city guard, but I don't think they believed me. Someone needs to do something!"
"3952276-1-8727";"I'm not sure. A young Keeper of the Dead, Curate Gadayn, was with the prelate. I got the sense he didn't agree with Prelate Faram's decision, but his hands were tied.\n\nIf the Necropolis isn't opened again soon, who knows what the ancestors will do!"
"3952276-1-8728";"Just a lot of nonsense about fate and threads and such. If I didn't know better, I'd swear she was a master or a magister.\n\nShe said that if you want answers about her patron's adversaries—her words, not mine—you need to join her there."
"3952276-1-8729";"We escaped Apocrypha with a tome that belonged to a founding member of House Telvanni. It's rumored to contain dark, long-forbidden secrets.\n\nWe're in need of a witness to verify our achievement. Care to fill this role for a small sum of gold?"
"3952276-1-8730";"Go to Quires Wind, on the southern margin of Apocrypha. Find Cipher Agrushna. If she's still sane, she'll know what to do.\n\nPlease, traveler. Our work in Quires Wind is sacred. The evil that's corrupting the scriptorium must be rooted out!"
"3952276-1-8731";"Necrom. One of the first threads of fate we investigated to uncover the identity of Apocrypha's enemies. And, it is the only one we did not resolve. We must accompany Gadayn back there so he can return the Fulcrum Obscura.\n\nBut first, talk to Scruut."
"3952276-1-8732";"Nymics are the true names of Daedra. If we collect the pieces of Tho'at Replicanum's nymic, we can use it to summon her and rid the Infinite Archive of her malaise. At least, that's what I hope happens. \n\nI'm not destitute if that sways you."
"3952276-1-8733";"It wasn't long ago that these relics were in my family's possession. Had we not fallen out of favor, well, that's neither here nor there. I promise to return them.\n\nHere's a list of all the necessary relics. You'll be compensated, of course."
"3952276-1-8734";"More dangerous than some reckless, titleless mage casting ancient spells? Hardly. Besides, if you can provide me with pages, nicely bundled, I can magically bind them.\n\nDid I mention you'd be compensated?"
"3952276-1-8737";"Exactly. Don't forget to take some side portals. There's more to explore in this archive than either of us know.\n\nOh, and use the gifts from Hermaeus Mora to strengthen your weaker abilities or to increase your most powerful ones."
"3952276-1-8741";"Uh, Master Malkhest didn't anticipate that question. Look, monsters of ink are jumping out of books and attacking us.\n\nFiler Myx is waiting in the Infinite Archive. Master Malkhest gave him something for the mortal. A reward of some sort."
"3952276-1-8744";"The lines of possibility that weave through reality and hold everything together. Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, has been set free. Her presence threatens both our world and the realms beyond. Help me meet this threat and you will be rewarded."
"3952276-1-8745";"Bosmer who honor the Green wouldn't have anything to do with a wildburn seed, but I want to show the seed we recovered to a greenspeaker. If they can tell us more about it, it might lead us right to the Recollection.\n\nHelp me and I'll pay your way."
"3952276-1-8746";"When I think of Ayleids, I think of magic. Welkynd stones, portals, ancient relics. Things that would be dangerous in the wrong hands. But how it fits into Nantharion's plans, I don't know.\n\nThink you could help me piece it together, friend?"
"3952276-1-8747";"Precisely! Nantharion used the staff to prepare the wildburn seed ritual before you stopped it. I think the Skein is showing me places where Nantharion is using the staff to plant more seeds. A lot more.\n\nSo, friend, want to help me stop Nantharion?"
"3952276-1-8748";"Ithelia said something about a loom and restoring what was lost. And her plan probably leads to the end of reality that Leramil keeps going on about.\n\nLet's take the fight to Ithelia and maybe prevent whatever she has in mind. Are you with me?"
"3952276-1-8749";"I suggested we hide in the Ichor Sea until this blows over, but the Great Eye said no. So I need you and Leramil to accompany me to the instability.\n\nWill you serve as fate's chosen once more? I'll give you those pieces of gold you like so much."
"3952276-1-8750";"Apocrypha, like all Oblivion realms, is infinite. But we have the Skein of Secrets. I shall open a portal. Use the Skein once we cross into the realm and see if it can pinpoint Ithelia's location."
"3952276-1-8751";"Well, no. You also need to cast a spell to release each relic's energy and send it flowing into the fabric of reality. Here's the spell scroll.\n\nAnd you'll need help, so I'll send one of us to each location to assist you."
"3952276-1-8753";"They don't see eye to eye on anything. It's like they want to grind each other into bonemeal. A long story. \n\nIf you're inclined, find my Agawen Ciiril and tell her we're leaving. We need supplies and she might be willing to help us."
"3952276-1-8756";"Because I handle multiple matters for Count Calantius and my cohort should have been able to fend for itself. The estate's proximity to Skingrad makes it a tempting target for enemy forces.\n\nListen, help me find my legionaries and you'll be rewarded."
"3952276-1-8757";"Pass through this tangle and enter the inn. Find the source of this disturbance. Stop it however you can.\n\nI cannot assist you in this. You shall stand alone against a force that tangles fate and unravels reality. Succeed and you shall be rewarded."
"3952276-1-8758";"Apparently a few months back, what was once rolling hills and rich Colovian farmland was suddenly engulfed by this great forest.\n\nLook, help me rescue more Ostumir survivors, then we can find Sorilen. I can toss you some coin for your efforts."
"3952276-1-8759";"A valuable piece of Ayleid history. I made the mistake of … inviting … the Recollection to help me. They betrayed me. Can you help me recover my notes, see what the Elves are up to, and help find the Emblem? It will be worth your while."
"3952276-1-8761";"Not exactly. I was hunting a violent vampire gang called the Terrors when I found an invitation to the auction. Inviting vampires to such an event is strange enough, but offering this Vesper Valente vintage? That has me concerned.\n\nWill you help me?"
"3952276-1-8762";"In addition to defending the major roads to the north and east, its proximity to the devastated area and the new forest make it integral to the protection of the Weald heartland.\n\nWhat say you? Care to take a Legion commission and help me end this?"
"3952276-1-8763";"Was. Past tense. But I'm not about to bandy my history with Balandrus, the so-called Terror of the Weald, to a stranger. If you want to tag along while I finish him, feel free.\n\nBut I'll pay you. I don't like to owe favors. Not if I can avoid it."
"3952276-1-8764";"You'll find them throughout the Infinite Archive. Personally, I'd look in places where the maligraphies aren't trying to mangle you.\n\nI have more rewards. Promise me you'll help!"
"3952276-1-8765";"Raw deposits of Aetherial energy kept behind Ayleid security measures. Wouldn't be a problem except for Silorn's infestation.\n\nLook, I've got coin to spare. Any chance I could send you on in my stead? Otherwise I'm bone dust either way."
"3952276-1-8766";"A bit of brawn and a sharp blade would go a long way to saving those still trapped by rubble. As well as stopping the four Recollection rituals my guards spotted.\n\nHelp put a stop to this and I promise to make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8767";"The fate of my vineyard rests on that stolen shipment of Blue Aedral. Recover the lost crates along with my dear Lazen and evidence of whoever is responsible for this attack, and I promise to make it worth your while."
"3952276-1-8769";"Something killed the necromancers inside the ruins, but I believe they have risen from the grave to continue their dark ritual. These spirits are an affront to Arkay and we must exorcise them. I will reward you for your help in this."
"3952276-1-8770";"She disappeared into the nearby Fyrelight Cave. Adventurer, if you can recover my four dowry bundles, I promise to make it worth your while. Every scrap of silk and muddied jewel could save me from becoming the laughingstock of Skingrad."
"3952276-1-8771";"It happened so fast, the Legion has no idea we're in trouble. I need someone to accompany Legionary Calvo inside, reach the bell tower, and ring the warning signal.\n\nIf you're willing to take the job, Calvo can show you where to find what you need."
"3952276-1-8773";"If searching through a few Goblin camps to see what's upsetting them is all it takes to stop a tragedy from happening, I'll do it. Come with me? There's a Bitterfish camp not too far.\n\nI have some funding left over, you can have it if you help."
"3952276-1-8774";"Not the book, the pages. I lost the pages! The sheaves of paper are scattered throughout the archive. \n\nI have some tricks I picked up from living here. Verses. Things to make you stronger, quicker, sturdier. Bring me the pages and I'll give you one."
"3952276-1-8775";"All bookbinding supplies are kept in small lockboxes. It keeps the filers away. They think bookbinding supplies should get filed outside the archive. They make me nervous.\n\nLook for lockboxes."
"3952276-1-8778";"For now. Power draws mages like moths to a flame, we're a little hopeless that way. \n\nVotary Nahlia, a knight from the Order of the Lamp, is on the scene. She needs someone to help her explore this anomaly and assess the danger. What do you say?"
"3952276-1-8779";"I am but a messenger. My task is to set you upon the path. Seek out Leramil the Wise in the outlaws refuge of this city. She will explain what must be done to avert the ruin of all.\n\nI am told you will be well rewarded for your service."
"3952276-1-8780";"Yes. One Mizzik Thunderboots. It seems he and my aunt are old friends and he insisted on helping execute her will. I've had my fill, but you're welcome to lend him a hand. In fact, I can offer you a tidy sum if you can help move things along."
"3952276-1-8781";"The tribune and I didn't see any signs of combat. Just an empty courtyard. She ordered me to do one more sweep of the area and then report back to Skingrad, but I hate the idea of leaving her here alone.\n\nWill you aid Tribune Alea in her search?"
"3952276-1-8782";"I'd almost describe them as beautiful if they didn't just try to eat me. The baroness helped evacuate as many merchants and civilians as she could, but there are still others trapped with those beasts.\n\nShe's promised gold in exchange for aid."
"3952276-1-8783";"Skill and luck go as far as a thrown spear. Only death wins every battle.\n\nIt's been a while since I trained here, but I think I can show the Recollection the meaning of Malacath's vengeance. What about you?"
"3952276-1-8785";"Some new group. They call themselves the Recollection, but I don't remember hearing about them before.\n\nIf you're too concerned about how the Recollection managed to overrun the Oathsworn, then you're not as Undaunted as I thought."
"3952276-1-8787";"These crystaljacks have never been seen in the area and we have no idea how dangerous they truly are. Studying their venom can help us ascertain that.\n\nJust gather a few of the scattered crystals or take some from wasp corpses."
"3952276-1-8788";"Only that he's using strange mushrooms that grow in the jungle to power his ritual. I suggest you take this torch and find some allies, then burn the mushrooms and deal with the spinner. You can find him in Fall's Glade to the southwest of Skingrad."
"3952276-1-8789";"Join forces with like-minded adventurers and fight off any Mirrormoor incursions you encounter. It's dangerous, but the Legion pays well. Just remember to defeat the incursion leader and you'll repel the attack.\n\nCan we count on you?"
"3952276-1-8790";"We equipped the workers with packs of the best logging equipment in the Imperial stores. Retrieve any packs you find and bring them to me so I can catalog them and return them to inventory.\n\nThe Legion can't afford to lose such valuable tools."
"3952276-1-8792";"Oh, I'm not. But Count Calantius is, and he tasked the Legion with recovering them for a Reach diplomat. Apparently these trinkets, that Varen's forces considered unimportant and tossed in rubble heaps, actually have some sort of sentimental value."
"3952276-1-8793";"The printer rearranged the words I provided. The finished document contains a terrible insult to both the count and Skingrad. I need someone to travel north to Fort Colovia and burn the crates containing the invitations before they get distributed."
"3952276-1-8794";"Reports indicate sightings to the southwest, near Fyrelight Cave. I need someone to see if the tharriker are establishing dens. Then collect samples for our mages to study. Claws, fangs, feathers, and eggshells should suffice.\n\nInterested?"
"3952276-1-8795";"Oh, just what one expects to find in Ayleid ruins. Spirits, ancient traps, natural hazards, structural instability. Those sorts of things.\n\nTake this journal and record your findings in it. Then return it to me when you're done. And do be careful."
"3952276-1-8796";"We assume so. Take your most-trusted allies and search for a cave to the north. I want you to not only destroy this Daedric creature, but also to recover the Legion armaments from our fallen soldiers.\n\nCan I count on you, adventurer?"
"3952276-1-8797";"Seems the Goblins have already trained two massive tharrikers, Fang and Talon, to guard the camp. They must be put down. Then destroy whatever supplies the Goblins are using to train the beasts.\n\nYou'll need help with this, so bring friends."
"3952276-1-8798";"To the southeast, wandering along Fortune's Bluff. Oh, one more thing. Take these liminal soul gems. We had the Mages Guild place sentry spheres in the area to alert us to more Daedric incursions, but they need to be regularly recharged. Interested?"
"3952276-1-8799";"I received word that Recollection leaders are meeting far to the west of here, near the town of Sutch, in a place called Frontier's Cradle.\n\nI need a group of adventurers to dispatch these leaders and gather any information you can find there."
"3952276-1-8800";"That's terrible! Have you ever heard a dozen nobles scream and demand action? Or withered under the gaze of an angry count?\n\nTake some friends and deal with this threat. Then place these warning bulletins in the area until I can confirm it's safe."
"3952276-1-8838";"It's probable. But no one invades my realm and takes my spoils of combat. If you can stop the Blind from taking whatever it is she's after, I will reward you.\n\nDo we have a deal?"
"3952276-1-8840";"The Bedlam Veil is a trophy room of sorts. The Blind and her cultists are probably looking to take something particular from the vaults. \n\nYou could ask Fa-Nuit-Hen, but impressing them is a better use of your time. They'll probably reward you, too."
"3952276-1-8841";"And I'd share them with you if I could, but neither the tribune nor the Wood Elf deem it necessary to provide me with the full details.\n\nI was sent to deliver the message. It's up to you to heed the call. Once there, I'm sure they'll tell you more."
"3952276-1-8844";"Just that Beragon and the tribune have been conferring with that strange High Elf, Leramil. Something about the Daedric incursions being a diversion to the real threat to reality. Whatever that means.\n\nWill you go talk to Beragon?"
"3952276-1-8845";"Was. Past tense. But I'm not about to bandy my history with Balandrus, the so-called Terror of the Weald, to a stranger. If you want to tag along while I finish him, feel free.\n\nBut I'll pay you. I don't like to owe favors. Not if I can avoid it."
"3952276-1-8846";"Beragon. He came to Ostumir looking for his friend. Greenspeaker Sorilen, I believe he said her name was. After the disaster, he didn't hesitate to help.\n\nYou should join him. He's looking for survivors and could use a hand."
"3952276-1-8847";"Find Narsis and help him recover the Emblem from Wendir. Here, let me mark it on your map. The area is swarming with Wood Elves of the Recollection. My dear Narsis is brilliant but impulsive, and needs someone to protect him from his own enthusiasm."
"3952276-1-8849";"I am but a messenger. My task is to set you upon the path. Seek out Leramil the Wise in the outlaws refuge of this city. She will explain what must be done to avert the ruin of all.\n\nI am told you will be well rewarded for your service."
"3952276-1-8851";"I am but a messenger. My task is to set you upon the path. Seek out Leramil the Wise in the outlaws refuge of this city. She will explain what must be done to avert the ruin of all.\n\nI am told you will be well rewarded for your service."
"3952276-1-8868";"Not yet. First, I volunteered to replace him as constable. Then I had to make the arrangements to bury him. \n\nWith multiple deaths to investigate, I was hoping to hire a deputy. Would you be interested in the job, traveler?"
"3952276-1-8875";"He's no big deal. Just the founder of the Garland Ring itself! The cultivator of all our spylike activities. A font of sunshine and hope and … and all the other stuff the Ring stands for.\n\nAnd he loves riddles. You up for a little adventure?"
"3952276-1-8876";"Snapdragon has apparently been looking into the traitor situation since she quit the Ring. She keeps her research at a little cottage she has in Firsthold. Place we often used as a safehouse.\n\nI'll mark it on your map and then we can go meet her."
"3952276-1-8877";"I'd guess it has something to do with all the research she did into the Ceythalmor, but there's only one way to be certain.\n\nI say we head to the Foundation of Trust bank in Marbruk and see what she locked in the coffer for me. Well, for us."
"3952276-1-8878";"Ever since father began his journey of culinary exploration, his rivals have made things difficult. They spread lies. Even stole my ingredients!\n\nCould you help? Fling pies to embarrass them and recover the ingredients for the Jubilee Cake?"
"3952276-1-8880";"The tall inquisitor here has need of the Twilight Cantors. Viti and I have been conscripted into service, and that service is elsewhere. Apparently.\n\nBut you could investigate. Surely Azurah will reward your curiosity."
"3952276-1-8882";"Meaning that while no new tears are appearing in reality, the existing tears aren't going away—they're getting bigger! Like a ripped sail shredding in a strong wind.\n\nWill you go back to my townhouse in Skingrad and talk to Leramil?"
"3952276-1-8884";"You couldn't be more right. What are the Luminaries? How do they relate to this lost art of Scribing? We have more questions than answers. \n\nLuckily, we also have you. Give the Crow my regards, traveler."
"3952276-1-8887";"She's at my townhouse in Skingrad. Get there as soon as you can, friend. I'll meet you there."
"3952276-1-8888";"Find Narsis and help him recover the Emblem from Wendir. Here, let me mark it on your map. He had some Wood Elf allies, but I do not trust them. My dear Narsis is brilliant but impulsive, and needs someone to protect him from his own enthusiasm."
"3952276-1-8895";"Join forces with like-minded adventurers and fight off any Mirrormoor incursions you encounter. It's dangerous, but the Legion pays well. Just remember to defeat the incursion leader and you'll repel the attack.\n\nCan we count on you?"
"3952276-1-8896";"She's a Goblin researcher. Pim's taken special interest in the two tribes which have camps near our farm. She talks about Goblins like they're the best thing in all of West Weald!\n\nGo talk to Pim, I'm sure she'd pay you for your help."
"3952276-1-8899";"If I get what's coming to me, so be it. The price of being a thief. But we left that life years ago. The other Scarlets don't deserve to die.\n\nCan you help me gather the crew? Protect them from whoever's hunting us? I can pay you. Thief's honor!"
"3952276-1-8900";"Redfur Trading Post in northern Grahtwood. If such a place was standing in my time, it went by another name. It could be the ruins of the Halls of Colossus for all I know.\n\nPlease, lead the way. Let us make haste to see our ja'rithantii again."
"3952276-1-8904";"Marcien knows their way around the woods, but it can be a dangerous place.\n\nYou've done so much, but I have one last request. Please find out what happened to Marcien. I'll pay you for your help. Their camp is just north of us, you can start there."
"3952276-1-8905";"Keshargo has his reasons, but look around. Xoryn did this. He should not have the knot's power.\n\nOur camp contains the null arca, a container to stabilize the knot. We must find it before Xoryn does and place it in the null arca. Can you help?"
"3952276-1-8908";"Neletai would know. Nothing escapes her notice. \n\nIf you think you can help us, please find her. She's wealthy and doesn't care for mortal currency, so I know she'd make it worth your while. Please say you'll go."
"3952276-1-8909";"When the Daedra ambushed us and Ulrath turned on me, I ordered the patrol to take shelter in Fort Hastrel, to the northwest. Any survivors should be there.\n\nI need to know what happened to Ulrath—and to my squad. Report back to me with any news."
"3952276-1-8910";"Certainly! Tribune Alea commands you to go to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and assist the amiable Wood Elf with his ongoing investigation of the Recollection.\n\nShe also wanted me to tell you that either she or Beragon would compensate you well."
"3952276-1-8911";"I would like to talk to Cantor Krin'ze first. Get her insight into High Cantor Viti's motives and ensure Krin'ze remains safe.\n\nI sent Ja'kh to lead her to Dunei—err, Dune. In Reaper's March. Will you join me, tamiit?"
"3952276-1-8913";"I promised the count that I would not return without his pet—Burnbiscuit's probably near where the entourage was attacked. Let me mark it on your map. We should start the search there. I'm sure the count will provide a reward for your help."
"3952276-1-8914";"Must I repeat myself? You saw my fear earlier.\n\nI don't miss my stupid whims, but I'm not myself without my facets. They're running wild and now they won't return to me. Maybe a stranger could convince them to come back. I'll make it worth your time."
"3952276-1-8915";"The Wing of the Crow. When we first met, I said that it was up to the Luminaries if you would be Ulfsild's inheritor.\n\nNow you face a test unlike any you have seen before. There is an echo of Ulfsild nearby. Listen to it, and then we fly."
"3952276-1-8916";"There was a passage into the mountains from Weeping Wind Cave in Reaper's March. Difficult to find, even in my day.\n\nI am determined to redeem myself and see an end to Ravith-morna. This path feels right. Will you come with me, tamiit?"
"3952276-1-8917";"Tribune Alea ordered me to locate you and deliver this message. She wants you to meet her at a townhouse in Skingrad. Belongs to a Wood Elf named Beragon. Says the two of you need to talk to him about the troubles plaguing West Weald.\n\nThat's it."
"3952276-1-8918";"You need to return to the Tree Elf's dwelling in … that mortal city …. Beragrad. In Skingon. Something like that.\n\nI hate your primitive yet unduly complex language, you know that?"
"3952276-1-8926";"The Haunted are mortals overcome by fear. Hollowjack lured them to Detritus, terrorized them, and released them back into the world. Unless someone does something, they're doomed. As a priest of Stendarr, God of Mercy, I implore you to help!"
"3952276-1-8930";"Kill me? One of those rotten ink bags slammed me into the dirt so hard it severed my tie to existence. I want to return the favor.\n\nHelp me. You'll get a reward for killing a monster you were probably going to fight anyway. You have nothing to lose."
"3952276-1-8933";"Idols, curios, whatever looks Ayleid. I'm not the most nimble of Wood Elves, but you could be fast enough to find and bundle the remnants for me to finish my book. Five are all I ask to start with. And I have a lot of gold to spare."
"3952276-1-8936";"Because I would still be alive if it wasn't for them. They severed my threads of fate. All my hard work … erased.\n\nBut you can do what I can't. Make them pay for what they did to me and I will pay you."
"3952276-1-8938";"I'm not sure yet.\n\nI have coin and I'm a capable battlemage, but I'd rather not take on an entire noble family with little preparation. The Albuses must be stopped. Before more soldiers disappear. Are you with me?"
"3952276-1-8940";"Confident talk doesn't impress me. Competent fighters do. \n\nRumors say the Albus family is operating the redoubt. They're a long line of fearsome wizards. Plant our banner before you fight Cato Albus and then I'll be impressed."
"3952276-1-8941";"The prophecy isn't about the empire at all! But prophecies have changed for less. Innocents died because Orpheon didn't listen to reason. If he uses the scroll to gain power ….\n\nThe Hel Netu have little use for gold. It's yours if you help us."
"3952276-1-8943";"Ha! Orpheon's raised an army of deserters large enough that I heard about them before this attack. But if you think you need an added challenge, you could always plant our banner before you slit Orpheon's throat.\n\nDo this and you'll get your reward."
"3952276-1-8944";"Enter Detritus once more and defeat Lord Hollowjack. Disperse his power for a time, until the Witches Festival ends. Prepare yourself and your allies to confront him again!"
"3952276-1-9009";"Yes. Merric was supposed to meet me here, but he never arrived. While most of the guild secures the remaining guildhalls, I could use some outside help to track down our guildmaster. Then together we can stop these attacks.\n\nCan I hire you, wayfarer?"
"3952276-1-9032";"Just that. I was supposed to meet him here, but he never arrived. Most of the guild is securing the remaining halls, but with you here we can track down the guildmaster and stop these attacks. \n\nThe guild needs you, comrade. Will you answer the call?"
"3952276-1-9039";"Perhaps, but I don't think so. Everything happened quickly after Merric destroyed the soul reaper and Mezamma retreated.\n\nThe job I hired you for ended when we found Merric, but I'd like to extend your employment. Help us assault the Worm Cult nest."
"3952276-1-9040";"Since you uncovered the location of the Worm Nest, it's only right that you're there when we destroy it. While Prince Azah focuses on dealing with Mezamma and I learn more about the soul reapers, you're our support.\n\nWhat do you say? Can we hire you?"
