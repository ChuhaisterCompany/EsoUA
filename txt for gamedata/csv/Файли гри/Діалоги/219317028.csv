"219317028-0-63";"You have achieved Champion 60 — most impressive! In celebration, a special Dark Seducer costume has been added to your Collection."

"219317028-0-65";"My name is Gavin Gavonne. Thank you for this employment opportunity. I hope these provisions will prove useful. P.S. Do not concern yourself with the bloodstains on this missive. I was not seriously injured when I stumbled off of the precipice. My fall was broken by a thick patch of spinethorn nettles."
"219317028-0-66";"I hope these provisioner components reach you in a timely manner. I got turned about in a strange swamp and lost one boot to the mud. The nearest wayshrine was a short walk, but a very long hop."
"219317028-0-67";"I must apologize for the delay. I am traveling with a caravan of entertainers, primarily females. I am not used to girls, or their customs. They roll their eyes a lot, and seem to reply to everything by saying  what? I only recently realized they do that to give you the chance to change what you said."
"219317028-0-68";"I am happy to be back in civilization. I return to the city as I once entered this world--wet, hungry and completely naked. A word of advice. When you play dice with a Khajiit, do not wager your armor. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-69";"I hope these components reach you on time. I was delayed. I swore I would not return to that gambling caravan, but I found myself there once again, and I lost my wages. They told me I was gullible, so I had to go back. How else could I prove them wrong?"
"219317028-0-70";"Once again, my possessions and I came to a parting of the ways. This time I was set upon by bandits. Ah, well. As my grandfather used to say: ""The more you have, the more you want. But the less you have, the wider the selection."" I can only conclude that my future contains unlimited possibilities."
"219317028-0-71";"Good day, my friend! Here is your delivery. My clarity of mind has improved considerably since out last correspondence. I believe this to be the result of daily meditation; a practice that I have recently taken up. I find it vastly preferable to sitting around doing nothing."
"219317028-0-72";"I decided that meditation is not for me, and thought I might take up the study of music. I found an Orc merchant specializing in musical instruments of every type. I asked him for a recommendation. He sold me a blunt instrument and told me to knock myself out. I was a half day's ride from him before I got the joke."
"219317028-0-73";"I hope this delivery finds you well. I purchased a mandolin and I'm teaching myself to play. In fact, today I wrote a song on cats. That may have been a mistake, because verse number three got run over by a wagon. Next time I'll use parchment."
"219317028-0-74";"I got caught in two rainstorms yesterday, and then a hailstorm, which is hard rain that hurts and puts dents in your armor. Bad weather always surprises me. I'm glad I'm not a pessimist, because I don't think I'd be a very good one."
"219317028-0-75";"As I gathered components for this delivery, I got to thinking about moths. Why do you only see them at night? I'm not saying that they're vampire butterflies, but I started carrying extra toothpicks, just to be safe."
"219317028-0-76";"Another fine lot of provisioner components are enclosed. I decided to give up on music shortly after a drunken Nord smashed my mandolin. Looking for a new hobby, now. I thought about taking up juggling, but I don't have the balls. Any suggestions?"
"219317028-0-77";"The thing I hate the most about traveling in Tamriel are the damnable gnats, buzzing in my ears and stinging my flesh. Someone told me that the buzzing is the mating call of male gnats, but only female gnats bite, so now I get more nervous when I don't hear anything at all!"
"219317028-0-78";"Here is your delivery. I am now going to take a hot bath and consider why traveling only seems like an adventure in retrospect."
"219317028-0-79";"Your daily delivery is enclosed.  It occurs to me, in my travels, that the rest of Tamriel is filled with just the sort of people I try to ignore at home. And the worst of it is, in their lands, I'm the tourist."
"219317028-0-80";"Last week I learned some of the Khajiit language from a Baandari trader. I hoped it would be useful, but thus far I have been unable to make them understand their own language. Do they not have schools? Anyway, here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-81";"I am sorry for the late arrival of this delivery. I broke my arm in two places and had to seek a healer. The healer's advice was to stop collecting crafting materials in those two places."
"219317028-0-82";"I asked a wise mage about the meaning of life. He said, ""Insignificant beings go about their affairs, unaware that a god-like being could wipe them out with something as casual as a scratch of its head."" I asked, ""That's the meaning of life?"" ""Sorry,"" he replied. ""I thought you said lice."" ""That's fine,"" I replied. ""I wanted to know about lice, too."""
"219317028-0-83";"In my travels, I seem to be running across ravenous wolves all too often. They rarely attack on sight, but if they want to catch you and eat you they can. I understand that this doesn't happen too often, but--and I am told that this is the important thing to remember--once is almost always enough."
"219317028-0-84";"Another delivery is enclosed. I noticed that my correspondence to you seems to be the only writing I do with any regularity, so I decided to keep a personal journal to record my thoughts. As it happens, I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think. I may take up drawing."
"219317028-0-85";"I have never been a religious man, but I've taken to visiting shrines and temples of late, to educate myself about the various dieties of Tamriel. After weeks of careful study, I have come to the conclusion that everybody seems to worship the gods that hate the same people they do. Curious."
"219317028-0-86";"Waxing philosophic on the road today. I see Dark Anchors everywhere and the drums of war filling the air, and I find myself growing more and more pessimistic about Tamriel's future. What if today turns out to be the tomorrow I worried about yesterday? Also, I am quite drunk."
"219317028-0-87";"While gathering these components I happened upon a priest of Stendarr. He told me that we are born into this life to help others. I said that if that is true, then why are the others here? He kicked me in the shins. God of Merciful Forbearance my arse."
"219317028-0-88";"Ducked into a tavern to get out of the rain and have a hot meal. The food was terrible and the service was worse, but I honestly didn't mind. It made me feel better about not having enough coin to leave a tip. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-89";"I've had many close calls on the road with highwayman, ferocious animals, and monsters of every description, and yet I still continue in this line of work. Why? I'm not sure. I'm no hero, believe me. I just figure that death is inevitable, and the day I die will be a day like any other. Just a bit shorter."
"219317028-0-90";"Here are your provisioner components. I will make this letter brief, as I have come down with an infuriating case of the hiccups. In an effort to scare myself, and thus relieve my condition, I am planning to enter a crypt that is reportedly haunted. Wish me luck."
"219317028-0-91";"Your delivery is enclosed. My hiccups continue, unabated. This makes hunting difficult, as the animals can hear me coming. The crypt was indeed haunted, and I now find myself in need of a cure for the hiccups and a fresh pair of trousers."
"219317028-0-92";"I'm curious what the most prolonged case of hiccups might be, for surely my condition is unparalleled. I have tried breathing into a sack, eating a spoonful of honey, drinking the juice of pickled cucumbers, pulling on my tongue, and hanging upside down. None of these have worked. I may seek the counsel of a mage."
"219317028-0-93";"I am successfully hunting once again. The mage cured my hiccups, but he cannot revert my ears to their original size. On a positive note, my hearing has never been more acute."
"219317028-0-94";"I am traveling with a Nord. We visited a tavern and a fly landed in my mug. I plucked it out and kept drinking. Then a fly landed in the mug of a Wood Elf. He set it aside and ordered a fresh mug. Finally, a fly settled in the Nord's drink. He plucked the fly from his mug, held it in his open palm and screamed, ""Spit it out, you greedy horker!"""
"219317028-0-95";"Today, Clavicus Vile appeared and offered us three wishes. The Nord shouted, ""Mead!"" and a large mug of mead appeared. He drank it down, and it was instantly refilled. ""Shor's bones, that's terrific!"" he exclaimed. Vile smiled. ""And two wishes remain."" ""Well,"" said the Nord, ""Give us two more of these!"" I am beginning question his priorities."
"219317028-0-96";"A word of wisdom from one who learned a thing or two in his travels: no matter how much your drunken companion might encourage it, never, under any circumstances, should you moon a werewolf."
"219317028-0-97";"The Nord and I have parted ways. We'd been drinking, and he told a Breton joke, which I politely laughed at. Then I said, ""What's the difference between a Nord wedding and a Nord funeral?"" ""I don't know,"" he said. And I replied, ""One less Nord!"" The healer says it was a clean break, and my arm should be fully mended in a few weeks."
"219317028-0-98";"My friend, I have wondrous news! I am in love! She is a dainty, sweet thing, full of caring and honesty, and she has the bluest eyes I have ever seen! I may propose marriage this very night! A selection of quality components is enclosed."
"219317028-0-99";"I managed to acquire your components, but did so with a heavy heart. Upon waking, the sweet young thing to whom I proposed marriage was nowhere to be found. I fear she was abducted in the night by the very same villains who made off with my coin purse. I will not rest until I find her again!"
"219317028-0-100";"I finally found my betrothed working in a house of ill-repute. She was not the bright-eyed lass I remembered, and immediately the wise words of my beloved mother came to me, from so many years ago. ""You shouldn't have picked that up,"" she told me, ""you don't know where it's been."""
"219317028-0-101";"Here are your components. I don't know if I've told you this, but I appreciate the trust you continue to impart to me. This is the best job I have ever had. I am paid just enough to avoid quitting, and work just enough to avoid getting fired."
"219317028-0-102";"I try to keep your components varied and plentiful. Towards that end I have been trying to fish more frequently. I find it quite relaxing, as well as an excellent excuse for drinking while the sun is up."
"219317028-0-103";"I've been enjoying fishing. Though I'm not very good at it, it gives me time to think. After some time, and some mead, I began to feel a kinship with these strange gilled creatures. We are very much alike. We both get into trouble when we open our mouths."
"219317028-0-104";"My fishing expeditions have only been marginally successful. Recently I met a wily Argonian who said that a fisherman is really just a jerk on one end of a line, waiting for a jerk on the other. I should hunt more."
"219317028-0-105";"Apologies if these components are late. Rather uncomfortable today. I went into the woods to answer nature's call, and grabbed a handful of leaves to clean up. It was a small, glossy green plant with three leaves. I may have made a rash decision."
"219317028-0-106";"It always amazes me how many people leave books scattered in the wilderness. Most of those I've stumbled upon are scholarly works and dry histories, but today I found a book of fiction that intrigues me. It is entitled ""The Lusty Argonian Maid."" I may stay at a common house tonight, and read it in my bunk."
"219317028-0-107";"Here is your delivery. ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"" is a work of genius. Truly a classic that will almost certainly survive the ages. I wonder if there is a sequel. There were many unanswered questions."
"219317028-0-108";"I never seem to pack enough sweetrolls."
"219317028-0-109";"Last night I stumbled upon a group of revelers who greeted me as though I were expected. They gave me strong drink and many claps upon the back, and we had a grand time. I awoke with a curious tattoo.  It appears I am now a member of a fraternal organization called ""The Morag Tong."" They seem like fine fellows. I hope I run into them again."
"219317028-0-110";"Here are your goods. I don't know how, or why, but I seem to be acquiring a reputation of sorts. Strangers wink at me, as though they know me. Shopkeepers offer me discounts. I don't know what I did to deserve such respect, but I am truly honored. I wonder if those Morag Tong fellows have something to do with it?"
"219317028-0-111";"A hooded stranger appeared in the dead of night. I knew I could trust him, for he bore a tattoo like mine. He gave me a scroll bearing the name of a local villager and told me he was a Mark, although the name on the scroll was Farfal. I promised that I would pay this Mark Farfal a visit, and give him the regards of the Morag Tong."
"219317028-0-112";"Well, this Morag Tong membership continues to pay great dividends! This Mark Farfal fellow opened his home to me, fed me and gave me a large sum of gold! A strange fellow, what with that nervous twitch of his, but quite agreeable. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-113";"A quick note along with your delivery. I must leave this area rather quickly, having discovered the true nature of the Morag Tong. Would you happen to know of a reliable person who can remove a tattoo?"
"219317028-0-114";"Today I discovered, on a dare, that there is no easy way to milk a Guar. Your provisioner components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-115";"Here is your delivery. I wonder, do you know anything of Khajiit etiquette?  What is the proper way to respond when your host coughs up a hairball at dinner?"
"219317028-0-116";"My latest traveling companion insisted on traveling at night, which was quite inconvenient and upsetting to my sleep cycle. I began to have my suspicions when he would leave the road to go hunting and return hours later with nothing to show for it. He swore up and down that he didn't know what a vampire was, then one morning it suddenly dawned on him. Have you any use for vampiric ash?"
"219317028-0-117";"Today I saw a spider so big and hairy it looked like it was wearing a wolf pelt. Is that even possible? Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-118";"I awoke this morning feeling regretful that I haven't seen my beloved family in years, but it passed when I remembered that the reason I became an adventurer in the first place was that I really can't stand my beloved family. Especially Alphonse."
"219317028-0-119";"As it turns out, Dark Elves are generous hosts when they aren't trying to kill you. Your provisioner components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-120";"A traveling merchant sold me a fine piece of armor called a pauldron. I don't know if it's supposed to go over my knee or my elbow, and I was too embarassed to ask him. I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that life would be much simpler if I didn't try to understand things. It was a real bargain, though."
"219317028-0-121";"I saw a Daedra for the first time. I can't get the image out of my head. For three nights running, I haven't been able to sleep at all. I feel pretty good, though. Just a little light headed. Trying to keep my wits about me and remain sane, so when the trees start talking to me, I refuse to talk back."
"219317028-0-122";"Sold that pauldron thing at a nice profit, so I took on a big, burly sellsword just in case I run into more of those Daedra. He's got a big scar and an eye patch, and he doesn't talk much. He said his name is Immaterial. That's a strange name, isn't it? Components enclosed."
"219317028-0-123";"Turns out the sellsword's name is ""Kull."" He doesn't talk much. I asked about his family, and he said ""Dead."" I asked if he was married. He said, ""Twice. Both dead."" I asked if he had many friends. He said, ""Just you.""  That made me nervous. Maybe he thinks a friend is just an enemy that's still alive."
"219317028-0-124";"Here are your goods. Interesting development. Kull saved my life. We were attacked by Orc marauders, and he took all six of them down without breaking a sweat. Maybe he is my friend."
"219317028-0-125";"Today Kull informed me that he's returning to the city to take up the study of flower arranging. I'm going to miss the big lug, but we must all follow our passions."
"219317028-0-126";"I love Tamriel. It's just the people I can't stand. Components enclosed."
"219317028-0-127";"Another meager delivery. It rained all night and the road is a muddy slog. I don't know if I'm over it, or used to it, but it's not bothering me as much as usual. Also, drunk again."
"219317028-0-128";"Close call on the road. A group of bloodthirsty Goblins passed so closely, they almost discovered my hiding place. I'm not afraid of death, mind you. I'd just like to avoid being there when it happens."
"219317028-0-129";"Traveling with another caravan, this time Baandari traders. I don't think these Khajiit like me. I've never been a cat man. I grew up with dogs. I think the Khajiit can tell this with one glance. One nasty, sidelong, vindictive glance. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-130";"Here are your components. I do not like these Khajiit. They are sarcastic and crude and do not appreciate my better qualities. Today over lunch I tried to build a sense of camaraderie by inviting them to sing a bawdy tavern song. My overtures were brutally rejected."
"219317028-0-131";"One of the Khajiit put a lizard in my bed roll. It's difficult to laugh at a practical joke when your whole life feels like one. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-132";"I hope this delivery finds you well. The Khajiit gave me some sweet candy called moon sugar, and now I can't feel my lips."
"219317028-0-133";"After two straight days of consuming liquor and moon sugar, I awoke to find that the Khajiit took to the road while I slept, abandoning me. I also can't find my pants."
"219317028-0-134";"The city guard arrested me and questioned me for hours, all because I arrived at the gates with no pants. They finally determined that I was harmless, and even gave me an old pair of tattered leggings. It must be Morndas. I've always hated Morndas. Delivery enclosed."
"219317028-0-135";"Here are your components. I took a hot bath for the first time in months. It was very relaxing, until I noticed I had six toes on one foot. I panicked, sure that I'd been the victim of a dreadful curse, and went to see the best, most expensive healer in the city. Turned out it was just a blister."
"219317028-0-136";"Another delivery for you. Rough day. I barely escaped another Brigand attack. Despite what the locals might tell you I did not ""run like a scared rabbit."" More like a brave and noble rabbit, who happened to be late for an appointment."
"219317028-0-137";"I hope someday we'll all be able to put away our fears and prejudices, and just make fun of Nords. (Delivery enclosed.)"
"219317028-0-138";"Your delivery is enclosed. Is it just me, or does every woman in Tamriel have severe emotional problems?"
"219317028-0-139";"I heard you were fighting against the forces of Molag Bal. You know, the more I learn about that guy, the more I don't care for him. Good luck! Delivery enclosed."
"219317028-0-140";"Sorry, I overslept. I hope these components still arrive in a timely manner. Sometimes I think that the only thing standing between me and achieving greatness is, well... me."
"219317028-0-141";"Here are your provisioner components. Interesting day. I got into a tavern fight. I really gave him a good shot to the knee with my chin, then got blood all over his fist, with my nose. That will teach him."
"219317028-0-142";"Writing this from a tavern, drinking mead and getting philosophical. I don't think I'll ever find true love. And neither will that toothless Khajiit over there. Or the lady with the mustache. Or pretty much anyone at table three."
"219317028-0-143";"Your next delivery is enclosed. I met a woman named Helga, and we had a torrid love affair that lasted all night. When we awoke and I gazed upon her in the light of the morning sun, she looked deep into my eyes and told me she wants to get married. I hope she meets someone nice."
"219317028-0-144";"Your provisioner components are enclosed. Interesting news. I just received a letter from my brother Alphonse. Apparently he was thrown into the King's dungeon for something he didn't do. He didn't run fast enough."
"219317028-0-145";"On my way to mail this, I noticed a city guard was following me. When I confronted him, he told me I was just being paranoid. That's impossible. I'm the opposite of paranoid. I suffer from delusions that people like me."
"219317028-0-146";"Your deliveries are enclosed. Though it is not definite yet, I am considering signing up for the military so that I can support our alliance's efforts in Cyrodiil. I will let you know as soon as possible, so that you can find a suitable replacement."
"219317028-0-147";"Please ignore my previous correspondence. I have decided not to join the army in Cyrodiil. Although I am firm in my beliefs, I decided that it would be a mistake to die for them, because what if they're wrong? Your components are attached."
"219317028-0-148";"I'm glad I decided to keep working for you. You continue to be a generous employer. They say that money isn't the key to happiness, but I figure, if I save up enough I can just have a key made. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-149";"I'm mailing this package and getting out of this city as quickly as possible. It's filled with criminals and thieves. The back alleys are so dangerous, you can get stabbed while you're getting stabbed. Must run, now. Being chased."
"219317028-0-150";"Sorry if this delivery was delayed. I got lost in the woods last night and had to use the stars to get my bearings, which got me lost further north."
"219317028-0-151";"Your delivery is enclosed. Yesterday I was hunting in the vicinity of the village where I grew up, so I stopped by to visit with my mother. She had a nice talk."
"219317028-0-152";"Back in the city today. I hate city people. I can tell how judgmental they are just by looking at them. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-153";"Here is your shipment. I hope it meets your needs. I decided to spend some of my savings to equip myself with better weapons for hunting and self defense. I got a new two-handed sword and a sturdy bow. I also got a new knife, but that's just in case of cake."
"219317028-0-154";"Found another lizard in my bedroll. I hate lizards. They're creepy, especially chameleons. When you stop and think about it, at any given time, there's no way to know how many chameleons are right in plain view. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-155";"I have an in-grown toenail and a huge pimple on my nose. And it just started raining. And my backpack split a seam. When I said, ""Can this day get any worse?"" it was a rhetorical question, not a challenge to the Divines."
"219317028-0-156";"Here are your components. I don't know why, but I seem to attract traveling companions that never stop talking. And the whole time all I can think is that I wish they'd finish so I can tell my own story that's not just better, but also directly involves me."
"219317028-0-157";"As I entered the city to mail your components, I noticed an unusual amount of politicians in town. Perhaps it's something to do with the war in Cyrodiil? Politicians are easy to spot. You can tell them by the complete vacancy occupying the space where their faces should be."
"219317028-0-158";"I bought a book about rare herbs in the hopes of increasing the quality of the components I've been gathering for you. The book is rather technical. Before I read it, I was confused about rare herbs. Now I'm still confused, but on a much higher level."
"219317028-0-159";"Here are your components. It astonishes me to think that you create delicious foods out of such simple substances. Cooking is as mysterious as alchemy to me. I never had fine foods growing up. Mother doesn't cook, she burns."
"219317028-0-160";"It occurs to me that the collecting I do for you usually only takes up half of my day. That means I am fully employed half the time, so it follows that I am a part-time unemployee. It also explains why I am usually drunk by mid-afternoon. It's mid-afternoon. Can you tell?"
"219317028-0-161";"Your provisioner components are enclosed. I wonder, have you ever tried cooking with wine? I find it quite pleasing. I've even heard that some people add it to the food."
"219317028-0-162";"I ran into Helga, the woman who shared my bed some time ago, and we spent another night together. If she were a pair of boots I would wear her out. I just wouldn't wear her out in public."
"219317028-0-163";"I wish I could afford a mount. I imagine the best thing about traveling on horseback is that you no longer have to step in the mess other people's horses leave behind."
"219317028-0-164";"Enclosed are your provisioner components. I hope you find them useful."
"219317028-0-165";"Madam Firilanya, at your service. A true pleasure to become your exclusive outfitter. Your sartorial expertise is known even in the Summerset Isles. With my extensive mercantile connections, I shall source materials so you may create the finest-fitting—and looking!—armors. I've enclosed proof of my diligence. Expect regular deliveries!"
"219317028-0-166";"Once again, a timely delivery. I do hope you are pleased with the contents. The seasonal rains nearly washed them from the docks, but a good Altmer securing chain is worth its weight in gold. Unless you're imprisoned, of course."
"219317028-0-167";"I don't know why High Elven names confuse many throughout Tamriel, but to help bridge cultural differences I answer to ""Miss Firi"" or ""Madam Lanya,"" as well as my given name. A competitor of mine once called me ""Fishwife Firi,"" so I undercut her prices until she left town. I had to draw the line somewhere."
"219317028-0-168";"I never understand complaints made about nautical travel. You begin and end each journey in port. There you can find excellent deals for materials, such as what I have enclosed. The sea salt should wash right off."
"219317028-0-169";"The prices on untreated boar hides are outrageous. It's as though they've been hunted to extinction, at least in Valenwood. All that Green Pact business must be the culprit. I wager they ate right through them!"
"219317028-0-170";"I heard a rumor of plague in the Colovian highlands. You have to take care when these things present themselves. If true there is great opportunity for profit, but if false you've wasted a trip. Until I know more I think I'll stick to the southern coasts. Wonderful prices down here, as I'm sure my latest delivery reveals."
"219317028-0-171";"I hope the first week in your employ has found you pleased with my services. If ever I am delayed due to the vagaries of travel, I have instructed my assistant to handle deliveries. This way you shall never want for a steady supply of materials."
"219317028-0-172";"This talk of war certainly makes things difficult for a roving outfitter such as myself, but no more so than anyone else. Some of the deals are phenomenal. But what use are cheaply purchased goods if they're raided or commandeered by roving armies?"
"219317028-0-173";"An interesting lead! Rumors tell of a haberdasher in Black Marsh whose treated wamasu scales are crafted into the most eye-catching hats. In theory the same treated scales could be applied to pauldrons or hauberks. Perhaps they'll be flashier than the materials I've provided today!"
"219317028-0-174";"My journey to Black Marsh begins in earnest, in search of treated wamasu scales. If I can convince the haberdasher to reveal his treatment process, I shall stockpile wamasu scales and corner the market."
"219317028-0-175";"Fleshflies. I've had enough of the filthy creatures! Not for my own flesh, but that of the leatherwork I brought for trade. Thankfully they don't have a taste for the contents of my latest delivery."
"219317028-0-176";"Did you know there is no word in Jel for haberdasher? A friendly local informed me I should travel to the more remote villages and ask for a Kaoc Xuth Waxhuthi, which I'm told means ""hat create person."""
"219317028-0-177";"The haberdasher of Black Marsh was a rumor. ""Wamasu scale treatment"" is a Black Marsh jest for an impossible task. Also, never say Kaoc Xuth Waxhuthi in remote Argonian villages. The reaction is … unfavorable. (I must have written it down incorrectly.)"
"219317028-0-178";"I found the most amazing dish today near the border of Cyrodiil. The innkeeper called it an Eidar cap. You hollow out a bread loaf, melt Eidar cheese in a pot, and pour it inside the bread. You can dip the bread inside and eat it there, or let it cool and take the whole thing with you as you travel. Delicious!"
"219317028-0-179";"Cyrodiil is rife with bandits. They slew four caravan guards and made off with half of my baggage. But all is not lost! I recovered the chain mail from the guards' armor. A quick rinse, some polish, and I traded the lot in Bravil for the material I have enclosed."
"219317028-0-180";"You certainly know of the White-Gold Tower at the heart of the Imperial city. After all the turmoil, once things are stable, do you think they'd let me climb the tower and see the view? I bet you can see Auridon from up there."
"219317028-0-181";"A conjurer lost control of a Scamp this morning. The little thing found its way to the market and, I'm not entirely clear how, got its head stuck inside a melon. It teetered about, loosing balls of fire into the air, and eventually stumbled into a pile of manure which it then set alight. I've never seen so many laugh so hard while in such danger."
"219317028-0-182";"I lost a bet with a trader from Elsweyr. For the remainder of the week, whenever I barter for goods, I'm to wear a painted Khajiiti Senche-mask. I thought it would affect my trades, and it has! Last night, after finishing my trading, I overheard some locals mention the Cat Elf with the outstanding prices. I've doubled my volume!"
"219317028-0-183";"I once sold a shrine of Zenithar to a Breton noblewoman. Though I didn't own the shrine, I never once lied to her! There's an art to playing upon people's mistaken assumptions, and I simply wished to see how artful I was. Of course, I immediately tithed most of her payment to the nearest temple. It does one no good to mock the Eight Divines."
"219317028-0-184";"I heard a wandering priest of the Eight Divines was hung in the Imperial City. The charge was treason. No details, but the locals are uneasy. Time for me to move along. Uneasy locals means a general distrust of outsiders is just over the horizon."
"219317028-0-185";"There's no plague in the Colovian highlands. But there is good news! A wasting sickness has gripped much of the population. Rest, recuperation, and a strong tonic will cure it, but local custom has the sick wear flax scarves over their mouths and noses. The profits I made in selling the tawdry things went to the enclosed material."
"219317028-0-186";"Accused of spreading the plague with flax scarves. One step ahead of the mob. Forgive my brevity."
"219317028-0-187";"The mob torched the barn where I hid, but a kind sorcerer aided my escape! I am now hiding in the cave he calls his home. Most of my traveling stock was destroyed in the fire, but the sorcerer offered to deliver this letter and what meager material I brought with me. He seems a kindly old sort. You have him to thank for this delivery!"
"219317028-0-188";"The sorcerer who aided my escape belongs to the Cult of the Black Worm. He wished access to my ""plague scarves"" for his own purposes. I spun an elaborate lie of their hiding spot. When he left to retrieve them, I raided a hamper marked ""Plague Zombie Ritual Material"" and fled. Have no fear—neither the ""plague"" nor ""zombie"" portions were present."
"219317028-0-189";"I have completely replenished my stock! Worm Cult sorcerers have so much useful material at hand. The one who aided my escape from the mob wasn't happy to learn I'd had no part in the plague after all. It was a gamble to collapse the deadfall atop him when he returned to his cave, but sorcerers rarely look up. Enclosed are some of the spoils!"
"219317028-0-190";"Worked leather is impossible to find in the markets. The stock has dwindled to nothing, almost overnight. This tells me one of two things: either someone with much gold seeks to drive up the price before flooding the markets with leather, or they plan to armor a cohort of ogrim. I should watch for bulk purchases of oversized buckles!"
"219317028-0-191";"If you are ever offered something called ""pumpkin wine,"" you should pour the stuff anywhere but into your own mouth. I was not so lucky."
"219317028-0-192";"If the Mages Guild can communicate with every one of their chapters across Tamriel, why can't they alert one another to the spread of disease? You'd think such a service would benefit every Empire, kingdom, or stronghold in the land."
"219317028-0-193";"I'm due for more caravan travel as I seek out lower prices on trading stock. You learn to fight off the weariness in time. On those long roads, after a hard rain, the stench of a damp ox is often foul enough to keep your mind alert."
"219317028-0-194";"I must apologize for my previous shipment. It seems I swapped your intended package with materials owed to another. Here is the intended shipment, but as it was my mistake, you should keep the materials already received. This area is rife with thievery so I removed all labels from my packaging. I shall triple-check next time!"
"219317028-0-195";"This one is forwarding crafting materials to you. Pacrooti looks forward to a long and rewarding relationship with his honored friend, especially since the crooked dealers at the gambling caravan tricked him out of his hard-earned gold. Pacrooti will keep trying until he wins it back. That will teach them."
"219317028-0-196";"Here are your woodworking materials. Pacrooti is sad to see so much forest chopped and burned for the war effort. He thinks we should save the trees. If only we had a big warehouse to stack them in."
"219317028-0-197";"This one listens as he travels, to the whisper of the trees as they sway in the wind. The rustle of their leaves tell secrets. Their bark sings of times long past. The squirrels make a home in their hollows. Squirrels are delicious. Pacrooti has dinner on the mind--he hopes these components will be of use."
"219317028-0-198";"Pacrooti sends you another delivery of fine materials. He looks at the wood, and he wonders what will become of it? Will it form the crib of a child? The desk of a great scholar? The roof that protects a loving family? He hopes so, because he got a great many splinters in his rump collecting it."
"219317028-0-199";"This one is pleased to deliver more materials. He wishes to remind his friend that with just six pieces of wood, one can make a life, or make a coffin. Do coffins sell well?"
"219317028-0-200";"Pacrooti is enjoying this work. He travels light, with very few possessions. He thinks perhaps this is one of the two paths to true happiness. One can accumulate more and more, or simply desire to have less. It also helps to have a short memory."
"219317028-0-201";"Here are your materials. Everywhere he travels, Pacrooti sees Skooma addicts. This is a very sad thing for Pacrooti's people. For Khajiit of this kind, happiness is not enough. They demand euphoria. But all wind up smelling bad, with very few teeth."
"219317028-0-202";"Do all Bretons think they are hilarious with their joking? One of these had a ball of yarn which he rolled on the ground, thinking Pacrooti would chase it like a common housecat. Pacrooti did bat it around for awhile, but only after he made the Breton eat it."
"219317028-0-203";"Dark moons and dark claws, this was a foul day. It has not stopped raining, and Pacrooti's fur is matted and tangled, and his claws are caked with mud. But he did manage to collect for his honored friend. Your soggy components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-204";"Here is your new shipment. Pacrooti is back in the city and has spent many hours combing the tangles out of his fur. Later, he played dice with a young Breton and won an entire set of armor. He thinks he will sell it, as it would be too expensive to have a tail hole added."
"219317028-0-205";"Pacrooti found a grove of fine oaks and thought to gather materials for you. He did not realize that this grove was watched over by the Tree-Sap people, also called Bosmer. They caught Pacrooti in a net and gave him many words about something called The Green Pact. He promised to follow their law."
"219317028-0-206";"Pacrooti cannot reason with these Bosmer. He found a tree that was brown with yellow leaves, and still they hoot and hollar when he tries to cut it down. Why do they call it ""The Green Pact"" if it pertains to trees of all colors? Elves are crazy. Or maybe just color-blind."
"219317028-0-207";"Pacrooti left the lands of the Bosmer, and good riddance! It is impossible to conduct business among the crazy elves. He sets out today for the marshes to the south. He has heard there are even bigger trees there. Surely the locals will not mind Pacrooti harvesting the wood of these ""Hist Trees."""
"219317028-0-208";"Lizard men are foul mouthed and inhospitable. They would not let Pacrooti cut any Hist wood, but he did gather some sap to make a tea. Now all the lizard men have giant heads and they dance with talking grasshoppers. Pacrooti does not recommend making tea from Hist Sap."
"219317028-0-209";"Here is your shipment. Pacrooti will now take some time for himself. Perhaps he will go fishing. It makes Pacrooti somber to see others fishing with crude poles and strings with hooks. Why do humans not let their claws grow out?"
"219317028-0-210";"The moons are dark, this day. Pacrooti had heard of the Dark Anchors of Molag Bal, but now he has seen one up close. It made his fur stand on end. Pacrooti thinks there is no shame in running away from such things. And he did need to mail your shipment, after all."
"219317028-0-211";"Here are your materials. A caravan guard told Pacrooti that mudcrabs are delicious when steamed. Pacrooti caught some, but they were not delicious. How does one eat such things? He cooked them for hours, but still they are hard like rocks. This one thinks he broke a tooth."
"219317028-0-212";"This one is forwarding your supplies from a tavern that serves fine mead. Pacrooti drank all night with a very nice werewolf. When dawn came, the werewolf transformed into a fat Breton with bad teeth. Pacrooti thinks it is wise to avoid getting bitten by a fat Breton."
"219317028-0-213";"This one has found an additional source of income! He buys Potions of Stamina at discount prices from the Baandari traders and sells them in the city to old men with young, energetic wives. They say these potions are like a cross-town wagon in Windhelm. A one-hour wait for a two-minute ride."
"219317028-0-214";"This shipment may have been delayed. Pacrooti had too many drinks last night in a Nord tavern. He does not remember how, but at sunrise he found himself naked, lying in front of the fireplace. He would have slept longer, but a maid thought he was a bearskin rug, and beat him with a broom."
"219317028-0-215";"Here is your shipment. Today in the city, Pacrooti tried molasses for the first time. Surprisingly tasty and sweet. This one thinks he may try some other parts of the mole."
"219317028-0-216";"This one bought a horse that answers to commands. To make it stop, you shout ""Sweet roll!"" To make it go, you shout ""Thank the Divines!"" Pacrooti was riding and dozed off. When he awoke, the horse was racing towards a cliff. Pacrooti shouted ""Sweet roll!"" and it stopped just in time. ""Whew,"" Pacrooti said, ""Thank the Divines!"" Pacrooti had horsemeat for dinner."
"219317028-0-217";"Today Pacrooti heard a voice say ""Khajiit! I need your help!"" He turned around and saw a toad. The toad said ""I've been cursed by an evil mage. The curse will be broken if you kiss me. I will turn back into a beautiful maiden."" Pacrooti put the toad in his pocket. He can get a lot of gold for a talking frog."
"219317028-0-218";"Pacrooti hopes you enjoy these components. He ran from a pair of spriggans to retrieve them. It was most distressing, and Pacrooti had to send dozens of Breton mercenaries at them. Eventually, they stopped advancing, but this week's finances are strained."
"219317028-0-219";"As usual, Pacrooti wants you to make use of these components. He'll not begrudge you your method of consumption, whether you are constructing a bow, or simply putting this wood in your mouth. Unlike the Dunmer. This one was eating a Kwama egg today, and flavored it with moon sugar. Pacrooti's Dunmer chef slapped it out of his paw and stepped on it."
"219317028-0-220";"Has Pacrooti ever told you he is a Journeyman in the art of the Whispering Fang? Practicing claw forms as the sun gives way to the Moons helps to center this Khajiit. Pacrooti was practicing tonight when a monstrous bear attacked. Pacrooti assumed a claw stance, drew a bow, and fired into the bear's flank. It did not come back."
"219317028-0-221";"This one has had it with the high and haughty Elves who travel these roads. They act as if great Lorkhaj created the entire Mundus just for them. Pacrooti got so angry with one caravan, he dropped his pants and showed them his backside. Pacrooti's people call this, ""Giving them the Jone and Jode."""
"219317028-0-222";"Here is your shipment. Pacrooti has been pondering. Why do the humans insist on calling his people ""Cat Men?"" This makes no sense. We do not walk on four legs and rub against them, begging for food. This one thinks he will begin calling them ""Monkey Men."""
"219317028-0-223";"Pacrooti is pleased to deliver another shipment to his friend, as well as thanks for continued employment. He used his last earnings to purchase gold piercings for his ear. He is looking very sleek these days, or so the ladies tell him."
"219317028-0-224";"These components were hard to come by. Pacrooti defeated a wily Breton for them in a game of cups. This one watched him swindle dozens of people with his agility, and decided to play. Like the others, Pacrooti lifted a cup, but unlike them, he smashed it on the Breton's face. In his unconsciousness, Pacrooti took his gold and bought you your wood."
"219317028-0-225";"More components for you, my friend. Do excuse the smell. It has been long since Pacrooti touched water. He would rather fight a fire atronach than face water. This has unfortunate side effects, of course, and Pacrooti had to peel this wood off of him. This one guarantees it is of the highest quality, no matter how they smell."
"219317028-0-226";"Dear friend, you would tell Pacrooti if you thought he was being facetious, would you not? The local innkeeper tells Pacrooti that Pacrooti is not to be trusted, but can't give a good reason why. All Pacrooti has done is sleep in his room and take objects left in the open. He has never once told a lie or attempted an immoral act."
"219317028-0-227";"Pacrooti practices Whispering Fang, a powerful martial art. He met a Khajiit today, master of Goutfang, an opposing style. Khajiit and Pacrooti had words, and nearly began a contest to decide the superior method, but a mage appeared and lit the Goutfang master ablaze. Pacrooti escaped with the ""Senche Leaps"" technique. Whispering Fang never loses!"
"219317028-0-228";"More components for Pacrooti's dear friend. A drunken Imperial told me today that I reminded him of ""a small, upright senche-tiger."" He added, ""It should be very odd. But somehow, I don't mind."" Eventually, the Imperial fell asleep. No one was looking, so Pacrooti took his purse and bought you your components."
"219317028-0-229";"When Pacrooti has had too much Moon Sugar, his paws become very large. It is disconcerting, but the taste is exquisite. Moon sugar makes any food more edible."
"219317028-0-230";"Pacrooti hopes these components serve you well. Pacrooti took them from a local woodcutter whose home was full of circular, spidery writing. Pacrooti encountered a vicious pet there, with barbed, crimson skin. Luckily, he knows the secrets of the Whispering Fang, and won the ensuing game of predator and prey."
"219317028-0-231";"Today is the hundredth time someone has told Pacrooti that most component hunters find their stock honestly, in the fields and caves of Tamriel. People dislike that Pacrooti finds his in the pockets and drawers of others. At least you appreciate them. It would be impossible for you to find the original owners, anyhow."
"219317028-0-232";"Pacrooti finds magic difficult to understand, but does not despise its practicioners. He realizes that it is a danger to guard against, like any martial art, and studies mages carefully. Aiming for the hands seems particularly hindering. Gestures are key to spellcasting--always lifting an arm, clenching a fist. Difficult with bleeding limbs!"
"219317028-0-233";"Pacrooti has been thinking on the old masters of the Whispering Fang. His teachers told what he thought were fantasy stories: The Whispering masters could catch arrows, they said. Ridiculous, this one thought. But today, Pacrooti saw a senche-tiger catch a thrown knife with its teeth!  Pacrooti would try it, but he likes the way his face is."
"219317028-0-237";"Esteemed employer. My name is Abnab al-Babnab, and I've included a gathering of components with this letter. May they serve well. I plundered them from an ancient tomb, and happened upon the angry dead within. I fled, distracting them with a shrill noise. Should word reach you from my brother Ezdab, I assure you I was not ""shrieking like a boy."""
"219317028-0-238";"Abnab and his brother, Ezdab, have found for you a fine shipment of components. And enroute, we slayed the largest frost atronach I have ever glimpsed. Must be mages around--we hid in a tree for a day, let the sun work on its armor before I cleft it in twain. When it was over, Ezdab said the sun was in his eyes, but I think he was weeping quietly."
"219317028-0-239";"Esteemed employer, let it never be said that life be taken for granted. I attempted to lessen the weight of my cuirass with an enchantment before my morning swim, but my spell must have failed, for I sank like a mudcrab hurled into the sea by a precocious child. I am fortunate Ezdab was nearby, or you would not be receiving these components."
"219317028-0-240";"Honored employer, this is Ezdab writing you. My brother Abnab is currently indisposed. Did he tell you? The fool tried to swim wearing armor he enchanted! I had to dive to the bottom of Leafshadow Lake to rescue him, but it was worth the effort! I have not been so amused since he slept on an ant hill. Use these components well!"
"219317028-0-241";"I hope you'll find these components of use, esteemed employer! There are a hundred ways to die in the dungeons and crags of Tamriel, and just as many ways to save yourself using enchanted equipment. Plan accordingly!"
"219317028-0-242";"Esteemed employer, another shipment for you. I was among relatives today, cousins, and I had forgotten that my penchant for the art of enchantment is  irregular amongst our people. I distrust and abhor most uses of magic, though enchantment is a family tradition. My father was a journeyman, having learned the art from the Altmer."
"219317028-0-243";"Another shipment for you, friend. I hope my brother Ezdab handled the last package well. He is an oaf and a fool, and though both oafs and fools have their uses, they are prone to mucking about. Forgive me. I do not mean to share my sibling misgivings with you, but I only have so much ink and a single parchment, and the words wrote themselves."
"219317028-0-244";"Another day, another shipment for the esteemed employer! There are few weapons that feature a design as elegant as the sword, and a sharp edge provides balance and control to its wielder that blunt weapons or unwieldy axes lack. And there is no personal arm finer than an enchanted sword, regardless of what the Nords and the Elves say."
"219317028-0-245";"Esteemed employer, may these components avail you. I hope you fare as well in your journeys as my brother and I. Never fail to keep up with your enchanting! It could save your life! We would hate to lose you."
"219317028-0-246";"The kwama of the Darkshade Caverns in Deshaan are terrifying! I visited on my way to sending the components you now hold, adoring kwama eggs as I do. But the creatures there, that produce the magnificent egg, are grotesque and unlovely. They screeched at me like creatures from Oblivion. I will never look at those eggs the same way again."
"219317028-0-247";"Though Redguard have mastered blade design, the Dwemer have mastered everything else. Their constructs are the deadliest mortal-made artifacts I have ever encountered. I often ruminate on how Dwemer would improve the nearly-perfect Redguard scimitar. (An instrument that launches scimitars through the air comes to mind.) Enjoy your components!"
"219317028-0-248";"Another day, another shipment for my esteemed employer. Enjoy, my friend. I could sleep for many days after the last venture. We had stumbled upon an old Imperial fort--abandoned, of course, and we plucked it dry of resources. But we barely escaped the jaws of the wamasu that lived there. Its skin shed lightning! It was a storm on four legs!"
"219317028-0-249";"This latest package was our swiftest yet! A shame the delivery will slow your receipt of it, but my brother and I filled our packs days ahead of schedule. Perhaps we'll go our separate ways for once. It'll be pleasant not to hear his jeers and taunts. I tell you, my brother has the arm of a Sword Saint, but the brain of a child. Use your components well!"
"219317028-0-250";"Honored employer, this is Ezdab, brother of Abnab who writes to you. Along with the letter comes our latest shipment. Use it well, for there may not be another coming. My brother has disappeared. I do not wish to trouble you, nor do I think you can help--by the time this reaches you, if Abnab has not been found, likely it will be too late."
"219317028-0-251";"Honored employer, it is I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab, writing to you, again. My brother remains missing, but know that I will ensure you get your components. I've done the work for both of us, in his honor, and I always will, even if I never see him again. I would say that I regret haranguing him, but those are my fondest memories."
"219317028-0-252";"Honored employer, here are your components, as usual, and of the quality you are accustomed. I am pleased to report that my brother, Abnab, lives! By Leki's shining blade, I never thought I would see him again! I had worries about preparing a third shipment of components on my own, but the Scimitars of al-Babnab are reunited!"
"219317028-0-253";"Esteemed employer, it has been some time! It is I, Abnab, recently escaped from the clutches of the pirate scourge of Tamriel! I apologize for my absence. Luckily, the pirates had a use for my sword arm, and thought to have me serve as an enforcer. A story for another time, perhaps. As always, enjoy your components."
"219317028-0-254";"I hope these components avail you, esteemed employer. I realized today that I never told you how I came to escape the pirate crew. Those men were deranged. They told me to kill for them or die, so I confiscated a blade from my captors and killed them, instead! I was like a hero from out of a Yokudan myth! I assure you, they were all villains."
"219317028-0-255";"I'm afraid this shipment's component came with an extra price. Not for you, esteemed employer, but for myself and my brother. Ever since my time in captivity with the pirate crew, my blade has thirsted for blood. I provoke conflict as a matter of course. I cut a man down today, as he reached to lunge at my brother with his dagger. We fled."
"219317028-0-256";"May these components avail you. My brother and I have fled the city, as the guards have not given up their pursuit. I have sworn never to draw my sword on a lesser man again. Sword Saints of old exercised similar control over their aggression."
"219317028-0-257";"Another shipment for the esteemed employer! May it serve you well. My brother and I have returned to the wilderness, living off the land, and plundering wayward caves and abandoned spires where we can. We're fortunate that Tamriel is full of them. May fortune favor you, as it has done for me, my friend. It is good to be alive."
"219317028-0-258";"It is good to be adventuring again, esteemed employer. We filled this shipment faster than usual--enjoy. There will be another for you, soon, but the caverns and hollows of Tamriel await!"
"219317028-0-259";"I hope you consider me enough of an ally to suffer a little pondering with your components. I cannot sleep, of late. As you may remember, I recently slew a man to save my brother's life. I am skilled with a blade, and done my heritage proud, but I lament having to kill anyone. I wonder what my Yokudan ancestors would think."
"219317028-0-260";"Esteemed employer, I struggle to impart with words how good it feels to test my mettle against the beasts of the wilderness. Nothing to hold back, no guards to stop the fighting. Just a bundle of primal rage between me and your components. May this latest shipment avail you, my friend."
"219317028-0-261";"Honored employer, it is I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab, who writes to you. I apologize for my brother's penned rambling in recent shipments. We do not mean to burden you with our troubles. I tell him that you are our honored employer, and not an emotional outlet. The next time he feels like sharing, I assure you, I'll share my fists with his face."
"219317028-0-262";"Esteemed employer, this is Abnab. Ignore my brother's previous letter. I know that, were I in your position, I would appreciate being kept abreast of all goings-on regarding my employees. Thus, I provide detailed reports in my correspondence, along with the components, and will continue to do so."
"219317028-0-263";"Esteemed employer, behold the latest shipment. All goes well, though terrible dreams plague me of late, wherein my surroundings are shrouded in mist, and beasts, dozens, perhaps hundreds of them, scuttle in the space just beyond my vision, hungering to devour me. The dream is relentless, and is the same every night. No more kwama eggs before sleep."
"219317028-0-264";"Components on their way to you, esteemed employer. However, my unpleasant dreams continue. I've come to remember that they began when I slew a strange creature in an Ayleid ruin. It wielded a massive axe, but I was quicker, and its body dissolved before my eyes as I clove it in two. Perhaps it did not truly die. Perhaps it remains near me."
"219317028-0-265";"Our work continues, unhindered, though my unpleasant dreams persist. I experienced a different one tonight. A man who identified himself as the Harvester offered me great power if I would kill a captive of his. He would trade my sword for a crushing bludgeon that would drink the souls of my enemies. Ezdab woke me before I could answer."
"219317028-0-266";"I dreamed the dream again: A being called the Harvester offered me power in exchange for the murder of a man. The would-be victim, trapped in a claw-like cage, kneeled before me. When I refused, I felt the Harvester bristle, and I woke. Ezdab said I had left our cave for parts unknown during the night. I have never been a sleep walker."
"219317028-0-267";"Ezdab writes you to please forgive the recent ravings of my brother. He has been odd since his encounter with the creature in the Ayleid ruin. A Dunmer mage we met in our travels spoke in a broken accent that it must have been a minion of a Corner of the House of Troubles, whose death attracted the Corner's attention. I nodded as if I understood."
"219317028-0-268";"As always, components of the highest quality for you, esteemed employer. They come all the sweeter with the fact that my brother and I slew a lich for them. Chased us out of the cave where we found it and half the length of the nearby stream before we realized our swords could cut it. We reduced it to  lifeless bonemeal relatively quickly."
"219317028-0-269";"Esteemed employer, you are of few people more worldly than I. Do you believe the legend of the Sword Saints of Yokuda? That they were caretakers of ancient sword techniques capable of rivaling the heretical power of eastern magic? To me, they are metaphors for the importance of sword skill, not beings with powers greater than other swordsmen."
"219317028-0-270";"Esteemed employer, my brother and I stumbled upon a coven of witches, this day, and there are few things I despise more. I don't know from where witches derive their supernatural abilities, but they are abhorrent. Luckily, these seemed to be asleep. My brother and I stripped the cave of resources and slipped away. Enjoy."
"219317028-0-271";"Esteemed employer, scholars may call me ignorant all they wish, but if the Sword Saints of Yokuda (called Ansei by those of greater intelligence and culture than I) could produce blades formed from nothing but spirit, then why in Oblivion would they carry steel of any kind? Preposterous. Ezdab and I nearly came to fisticuffs over it."
"219317028-0-272";"Esteemed employer, I have sent you a package. It is full of the components of your dreams. Once again, I have sweat and fought and bled for them. Have you ever considered doing the same for me? I'm not bitter--but I can see through everything. And I do mean everything, like it's made of glass. Not malachite glass. Looking glass. It's terrifying."
"219317028-0-273";"Is this how cat-folk see the world? Like looking into a bent mirror. Another package full of the things my brother and I collect. I hope you receive them intact--I can see straight through the container. At least, I believe that is what's happening. Brother Ezdab has been agitated with me of late. Are you agitated with me, as well?"
"219317028-0-274";"Ecstatic employer, I am writing to you from atop a pile of my own filth. But I didn't let that get in the way of work. The shipment is of the quality you are accustomed. My life has taken an interesting turn of late. I don't ever remembering being so free. I wonder if this is how a cliffracer feels, flying in the sky, as they do, so high."
"219317028-0-275";"Honored employer, I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab, apologize for my brother's recent correspondence. The usual shipment is included with this letter. Abnab is a light drinker, and only after he sent the last package did he stop to drunkenly mention that he has been writing to tell you of his stupor. I hope you will remain in business with us."
"219317028-0-276";"My friend, my brother has already apologized for my recent letters, but he does not know the entire tale. I was addicted to skooma. Some time ago, I met a Khajiit who was eager to part with his wares—he offered moon sugar at bargain price. Unfortunately, it was in a more-processed form. I hope we can continue to do business."
"219317028-0-277";"Another shipment for you, esteemed employer. You must tire of this, but allow me to apologize again for my skooma-penned letters. I hope, though you must think less of me, that you feel you can still rely on me as your premier source for enchanting components. My ancestors would be ashamed of me, just as I am of myself."
"219317028-0-278";"I am glad I found my calling as an enchantment specialist, I could not work in another field. I happened upon a professional chef in our travels this week and that Dunmer gourmet gave me a look of disgust that made me want to disappear. I was eating a kwama egg, lightly seasoned with moon sugar (my momentary skooma addiction led to a craving)."
"219317028-0-279";"May these components avail you! I continue to be surprised by the intolerance of my people against the enchanting I perform. There are magical elements to enchanting, but nothing so heretical as summoning a lich or absorbing another creature's essence. Enchanting is quantifiable, understandable. Given the chance, even Redguard can be strange."
"219317028-0-280";"Esteemed employer, there are a hundred reasons why one should never step foot into the home of a mage who is widely known as mad. However, one fantastic reason to do so is that mages are a great source of enchanting components, especially when they've taken leave of their cave. Enjoy your components!"
"219317028-0-281";"Esteemed employer, I have never trusted eastern magic, but I have never truly been menaced by it. Until now. This past week, the mad mage whose home I visited without permission decided to visit mine. Ezdab was asleep and saw nothing. I thought it was the end, but the mage simply stood in my chambers. Staring."
"219317028-0-282";"Esteemed employer, it has been some time since I invaded the home of that mad mage to pilfer some crafting components for you. The mage has taken to visiting my home in the evenings, though how he gains entry, I don't know. Every night, he stands next to my bed, watching. Brother Ezdab doesn't believe me, but brother Ezdab never sees him."
"219317028-0-283";"I have managed to ship components to you despite great duress, esteemed employer. As you may remember, a mad mage has been hounding me, visiting my bed chambers nightly, doing nothing but gazing at me. I've never been more terrified in my life. I don't know what he wants. I don't even know his name. No one believes he exists. By Leki's blade!"
"219317028-0-284";"Honored employer, it is I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab, handling the current shipment. I wanted to ensure everything was in order. Abnab has been indisposed as of late, and sleep-deprived for many days. He swears on Leki's blade that a ""mad mage"" haunts him late at night. I hope he hasn't returned to his skooma habit."
"219317028-0-285";"My friend, you may remember that a mad mage has been sneaking into my bed chambers every night for some time. Ezdab finally glimpsed him. The old man was sitting in a corner, staring. Ezdab gave him all our components. The man accepted the satchel, and left out the front door. We have not seen him since. I wish I had thought to do that."
"219317028-0-286";"Esteemed employer, I feel privileged to write you. You'll find the shipment intact, but I nearly lost my head! A duneripper the size of a carriage ambushed me, and I shattered my sword against its hide (though I must say I am proud to have struck first). I was forced to flee, and luckily had already ransacked the ruins that beast called home."
"219317028-0-287";"Use well these components, my friend. I lost several swords finding them, and thought of my father, who would be incensed I had wasted good blades. ""We are not like the Sword Saints of old,"" he said, ""who could create Shehai—swords made of spirit."" It was odd to me that my father believed Shehai were real. Perhaps he also had partaken in skooma."
"219317028-0-288";"I worry that my brother Ezdab has been led astray by the metaphorical tales of the Sword Saints. His techniques contain extraneous moves he swears the Saints of old also utilized. The Saints also claimed to be able to forge swords out of ""spirit energy,"" which is a claim a Bosmer tale would make. At any rate, may these components avail you."
"219317028-0-289";"Your components, esteemed employer! And let it never be said that the undead give nothing back to society, especially when one has mashed them into bonemeal, freeing one to scour their dwellings for components!"
"219317028-0-290";"Esteemed employer, when walking with an Orc, never pass in front of him in the open. The fool may engage you in a footrace and then cross in front of you (thereby cheating) to win. They are a cunning people."
"219317028-0-291";"Esteemed employer, what do you know of forest spirits? I believe I encountered one in an Ayleid ruin deep within Grahtwood. Whispered words I couldn't understand. Or I could have been hallucinating from malnourishment. I was at the end of a twenty-hour excursion. I left, in any event, as I already had the components you hold. No need to tempt fate."
"219317028-0-292";"Visiting a community, even a small town or hamlet, works to break the cadence of daily treks through ruins. It's nice to live a while where the challenge is not to find a place to sleep without being consumed alive, but to find a lass one fancies and ask her for a dance. At any rate, I hope you are well, and may these components avail you."
"219317028-0-293";"Behold the latest shipment! I must say that I outdid myself--I completed the package in a single excursion. Ezdab claims he has a nose for enchantment materials, but he doesn't have my sense of direction in the deeps of Tamriel. He enjoys jeering me for my (very reasonable) fear of the undead, but he can't find his way out of most linear caverns!"
"219317028-0-294";"Honored employer, it is I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab. I hope this shipment is to your satisfaction. My brother has been infuriating of late. He's in a tavern right now, boasting to all about how much time and cost he saves for the business. There is never any mention of my contributions, my (far superior) skill with a blade. He believes he is so great."
"219317028-0-295";"My friend, please ignore any backbiting my brother Ezdab may attempt on me in his letters to you. We have been feuding. He is a skilled enchanter and warrior, but he is not me. My father always said that none but the Sword Saints of old could rival my blade, and my sense of direction would make me a superior scout. He was correct on both counts!"
"219317028-0-296";"My friend, may this set of components avail you. I regret to inform you that my brother Ezdab is no longer with us. Rest assured this will not complicate our business relationship in the slightest."
"219317028-0-297";"Esteemed employer, I now realize I was unclear in my last correspondence. My brother is very much alive, though he has taken his business elsewhere. He refuses to express the nature of his absence, and I find myself competing with him in scouring the land for runestones and their like. I'll do my best to weather this development."
"219317028-0-298";"Esteemed employer, it is I, Abnab, with the latest shipment of components. I am afraid my brother continues to compete with me for resources, though I've managed to stay a pace ahead of him. I remain  bewildered at his abandonment, as we have worked together all our lives. He shames me, and he shames our family."
"219317028-0-299";"Honored employer, it is Ezdab who writes to you. I hope these components serve you well. You shall not be receiving a package from my brother Abnab this month, as he is indisposed. He has no components to give to you, at any rate--his skills cannot compare to my tremendous abilities. I have always known his arrogance would be his downfall, and today I proved it."
"219317028-0-300";"I've completed another shipment for you, esteemed employer, though my brother has betrayed me, and works to undermine me. The bastard stole the last shipment I collected. I have challenged the ruffian to a duel, as only one of us is going to provide this service to you. Enjoy your components, and prepare for many more from me."
"219317028-0-301";"I'm pleased to report my brother and I have resolved our differences. We dueled atop the highest desert dune we could find. Sparks from the crossing of our swords lit the night, and Ezdab matched me strike for strike until, with a final, gleaming slash, our blades shattered. No blood had been drawn, and there was nothing left to do but clasp hands."
"219317028-0-302";"May these components avail you, my friend. I hope you've used what I've sent both often and well. The power of enchanting should never be underestimated! Give me a dozen ways to defeat an opponent, and I'll give you twice as many enchantments to turn the tide!"
"219317028-0-303";"Another shipment for you, esteemed employer. I have come to a realization today that I replace more swords than the average adventurer. Brother Ezdab tells me it is the way I use them: as doorstops, to fell trees, shave. But what does he know? Ezdab believes that the Dwarves tossed a hammer across a continent."
"219317028-0-304";"Few weapons can match the elegant design of a good blade, and among blades, the scimitars of the Redguards stand as shining examples. The only possible improvement on such a weapon is an enchantment. You should try it. I doubt the spirit swords of the Sword Saints ever existed, but flaming scimitars do. I crafted one this morning."
"219317028-0-305";"May these components avail you, friend! Let it never be said that a sword isn't worth sharpening. I lost a scimitar today, when I thrust it into the gnashing gears of a Dwarven construct. I don't lament it--even a masterfully crafted blade can be replaced. Fortunately for me, even a lethal Dwarven machine is susceptible to a Redguard blade!"
"219317028-0-306";"Hagravens can be dangerous opponents, but my brother and I have become quite adept at fogging their minds by striking them in the brow with our sword hilts. They can't light the cave on fire when they can't see straight, and they're much easier to slay that way. May these components avail you!"
"219317028-0-307";"Your enchanting skills should be quite formidable at this juncture, esteemed employer. Have you considered utilizing a crushing enhancement? Such enchantments can turn the sharpest blades into effective bludgeoning instruments. Properly applied, one can smash ebony armor with the knife from one's boot!"
"219317028-0-308";"Esteemed employer, my brother and I passed a Breton village under siege by creatures of angry, crimson skin. We skirted the edge of the commune, and the sounds of clashing metal, cries of death, and the smell of burning flesh gave us horrified pause. We moved on. My brother and I are not heroes; not everyone can be you, my friend."
"219317028-0-309";"My brother and I were taking a shortcut in the city sewers (which were surprisingly unguarded) when we ran across a horde of crocodiles. Before today, I had never been in a city sewer before, nor had I seen a crocodile. Collecting for you certainly keeps life interesting. May these components avail you. They may be slightly odorous."
"219317028-0-310";"The life of a component collector is a dangerous one, esteemed employer. As a Redguard swordsman, I regularly practice sword forms to ensure my skills are as sharpened as my blades. I've heard the Sword Saints of old practiced forms that could conjure gusts of wind, and allow them to take flight like birds. Why, then, did they ever build staircases?"
"219317028-0-311";"Esteemed employer, this will seem like just another shipment to you, but my brother and I count ourselves lucky to be able to deliver it. We were trapped on a small boat when we lost our oars to a vile horker that wanted nothing more than for us to die. We drifted for two whole days before reaching sight of land. Were that I could duel that beast."
"219317028-0-312";"Enjoy this set of components, esteemed employer. I have taken up the chase for the vile horker that left my brother and myself stranded on a boat for  days when it dragged our oars to the bottom of the sea. I can tell the flopping bastards apart by the dagger that I sank into my opponent's flank. I've tracked him to a frozen islet to the north of Skyrim."
"219317028-0-313";"Esteemed employer, I remain in the north of Skyrim, hunting the horker that nearly killed me. Fear not, I shall ensure your shipments are uninterrupted, though enchanting components are difficult to come by out here. I spied the beast on an icy peak this morning, and will pursue. I despise it. I despise its beady, cowardly eyes."
"219317028-0-314";"I gaze full upon that cursed horker, and it gazes back. It has proven unexpectedly agile, and has the fortitude of a hundred workhorses, but today, it has nowhere else to run. I have chased it from frozen tundra to glacial isle, on foot and by boat. It is time. May these components avail you, for I know not which of us will walk from this melee."
"219317028-0-315";"Esteemed employer, I met the horker in combat. The sun hid from us as battle dawned, and only a grey gloom lit our skirmish. My scimitar sang as I drew it, eager for blood, and the bastard horker gnashed his teeth, narrowed his beady eyes. I fought like never before. And let me assure you--the horker's end was most disagreeable."
"219317028-0-316";"Honored employer, please do not tell my brother, but when Abnab bragged to you about his defeat of ""the horker from Oblivion"" he brought the body home, and in his feverish delight, failed to notice that there was no dagger wound on its flank—the beast's only discerning mark. I think my brother slew the wrong horker."
"219317028-0-317";"A Nord woman invited me to fisticuffs today. She was cheerful, and I assumed fisticuffs was slang for some jolly game until she punched my neck. I shoved a boot in her face lest I be laid low. We brawled. Afterward, my eyes were swollen, but I glimpsed her, and she smiled broadly, as blood streamed through her teeth and down her chin."
"219317028-0-318";"More components for the esteemed employer! If, one day, my brother and I find the time, we would enjoy visiting you. You could tell him how he should stop wasting his time studying the Sword Saint myths. It's ruining his sword stances; his fighting style is full of useless flourishes and movements patterned after dubious manuals he's found."
"219317028-0-319";"Another day, another shipment! It is I, Ezdab, brother of Abnab. Please ignore the rambling my brother must be heaping on you. I'm sure he's mentioned that he does not relish my studies of the Sword Saints, but I read voraciously. The greatest Sword Saint rose to prominence when he was fourteen years of age. I am already eighteen!"
"219317028-0-320";"May these components avail you. And may Leki avail my brother Ezdab, who will not stop filling his mind with the senseless drivel of the Sword Saint legends! In our latest excursion, we fought a harpy, as we do--repulsive creatures--and he swung a circular blow that took the harpy's head and nearly shaved my ear! He's going to get us killed."
"219317028-0-321";"Honored employer, please accept these components. Accept them as I wish my brother Abnab would accept me. I'm sure you recall that he abhors the research I conduct on Sword Saint techniques. He calls the idea of the Sword Saints a flight of fancy, that it pollutes my sword technique. But I match him in our duels, with any blade."
"219317028-0-322";"Another set of components for the employer! I wish you could meet with my brother Ezdab for he will not listen to reason from me. He could become the greatest swordsman I've met, if he would adhere to Redguard technique and forget the rubbish from the Yokudan Sword Saint manuals. They are ancient, misunderstood, and metaphorical in nature!"
"219317028-0-323";"My brother and I have finally settled our dispute, and will trouble you about it no longer. Fear not, for it did not hinder our collecting in the slightest. So eager were we to prove the other's sword skills inferior that we became like a single, whirling Dwemer of destruction. And I was the victor. Thirty slain beasts to my brother's twenty-eight."
"219317028-0-324";"Components for the honored employer! We are well, brother Abnab especially, gloating as he has been about (what he calls) his Redguard sword style triumphing over the wasteful flourishes of my techniques, which are informed by Yokudan Sword Saint manuals. I will never tell him, but I let him win. I'd like to think a Sword Saint would do the same."
"219317028-0-325";"A group of bandits wanted me to collect components for them in an Alik'ran cavern today, and bring for them a child who had entered to escape them. I gutted them before returning the child to his nearby village. I was once too fearful to help a village fight the Daedra. I swore it would never happen again. May these components avail you."
"219317028-0-326";"Honored employer, I do not understand why my brother Abnab enjoys making trouble for us so. He may have boasted to you about it already, but he recently slew a group of bandits who had kidnapped a child from a Breton village. May these components avail you, for it may be a while before we can send again. Word has it the bandits seek vengeance."
"219317028-0-327";"Esteemed employer, the inn where we slept tonight was owned and run by a bandit gang--the same bandits who want me dead! The fools snuck into our room in the night, but we were already on the rooftop. It was a long way down. For them."
"219317028-0-328";"Esteemed employer, I sometimes wonder if Nocturnal manipulates fate just to amuse herself. I'm sure you recall the bandit gang that declared war on me recently, and that I tossed about a half dozen of them off of the roof of their own inn. I expected I would need to flee, but the gang's leader, Gabryel Hoger, offered me a job!"
"219317028-0-329";"Esteemed employer, I don't want you to think that, though my brother and I have accepted a gracious offer from a second employer, that the quality of your shipments will be affected in any way. We are committed to serving you as we have always been! May these components avail you."
"219317028-0-330";"I've found that there is nothing more useful to an adventurer than preparedness. And nothing helps that better than enchantments. Just this afternoon, I burned an impeding spider's web with a fiery axe, stared straight through a lich's flame from behind my frosty helm, and smashed a skeleton to bits with the crushing edge of my knife."
"219317028-0-331";"Ezdab leaves his Yokudan texts aground after long nights of studying Sword Saint drivel, and today I happened upon an entry about the ancient welwa. It appears that welwa were myths even to ancient Yokuda, with the jaws of a bear, and the charging strength of a boar. It's a shame when beasts go extinct, but I'm glad not to meet welwa today."
"219317028-0-332";"Components for you, esteemed employer! I could have lost a foot to a guar today, were it not for the strengthening spell that gave my leather boots strength like steel! Never forget to enchant from head to toe if you can afford it, my friend, and may these components go a long way towards that."
"219317028-0-333";"Most adventurers treat Dwemer facilities as natural features of the Tamrielic landscape. After all, they've always been there, and many remain unclaimed, full of traps and mechanized death as they are. But I am quietly staggered when I stop to fathom how such a vast and mighty people could simply vanish and leave so much behind."
"219317028-0-334";"My brother Ezdab perhaps had too much to drink last night, for he swore from Alik'r to Skyrim that he had formed a Shehai, a spirit sword, like the Sword Saints of old. I asked him how. He said, matter of factly, ""Through sheer force of will."" I had to threaten to exile him from the family before he agreed to wear a sword for today's excursion."
"219317028-0-335";"An angered guar makes sounds like a pair of tortured Scamps inside a rolling barrel. Ezdab swears he does not know where it came from, but I was caught swordless as we made camp. I have never run so fast nor far in my life. There are more dangerous beasts that stalk Tamriel, but the gaping maw of a guar's mouth is a thing out of nightmare."
"219317028-0-336";"Let it never be said that a good sword never breaks. Today, I braced a one-of-a-kind, Yokudan-forged scimitar against a descending Dwemer door. It shattered in moments, but had I not offered it, I would have lost my brother and our scouting husky. Dwemer tombs and their damned secrets. May these components avail you."
"219317028-0-337";"Enclosed are your enchanting components, esteemed employer. I hope you find them useful."
"219317028-0-338";"Congratulations, you have reached Champion 10!

"219317028-0-372";"Finally, I've reached Anvil! With its protected harbor and well-traveled caravan routes, there is nowhere in Tamriel that I cannot send shipments. Except the Reach, of course. And Sunforge. Or Solstheim, come to think of it. But my point stands! Wherever you travel, my shipments shall follow. Even to those wretched places."
"219317028-0-373";"I've rented a small warehouse in Anvil for bulk goods. Now I may purchase directly from laden ships, store at the warehouse, and resell as needed. I'll need a good name for the placard, of course! It took a while to narrow down my options, but I've settled on ""The Bolt Hole."""
"219317028-0-374";"My new business is no longer ""The Bolt Hole."" Last night a crowd of drunken sailors arrived. From the name alone, they expected my new establishment to be a house of ill repute! To avoid further confusion, I changed the name to ""Bolts in Bulk."""
"219317028-0-375";"I erred again with my business name. ""Bolts in Bulk"" drew a different crowd of drunken sailors. It seems ""bolt"" is a local euphemism for something you'd associate with a bawdy house. This rules out my alternate names: ""The Bolt Store,"" ""The Better Bolt,"" and ""Barrelfuls of Bolts."" I've gone with a safe alternative: ""No-Bilk Silks."""
"219317028-0-376";"Ridiculous! ""No-Bilk Silks"" is the name of a well-known Argonian night-swain. I learned this from the well-heeled sailors who arrived last night, vastly disappointed he wasn't available for ""conversation."" I give up! Now I'm calling my business ""The Raw Deal."" I can only hope everyone thinks it's the least appealing brothel in Tamriel."
"219317028-0-377";"There is a danger in playing tavern games with which you are unfamiliar. This is why I learn every one of them! Seven Mugs, Skink Smash, Knuckle Jugglers, Troll Stutters, Red Staben's Dance, Frogswallow, Bilge Baiting, and even Wattle Swinging, which some Nords will say can be played with a mammoth. Do not believe this. They are testing you."
"219317028-0-378";"Anvil is an odd place. Everyone knows raiding bands keep gold flowing through the port. It's always rougher when their boats return, but the locals are mostly immune. Even the meanest dogs are loathe to foul their own nests. A curious balance, but they seem to keep it."
"219317028-0-379";"What do you suppose the moons are? The Khajiit think them gods, while the Mages Guild says they're islands in the sky. I've heard stranger theories. A sailor once said they were enormous atronachs, wrestling for the amusement of the Daedric Princes. He says it's what causes thunderstorms! Foolish man. Everybody knows they're made by Sheogorath."
"219317028-0-380";"There's been talk of werewolves in the nearby hills, so I've taken precautions with your latest package. You've no doubt noticed the smell on the packaging! It's a local remedy, sworn to keep them away. If you are yourself afflicted, my sincere apologies. Soak your hands with the salts in the enclosed pouch to soothe any irritation."
"219317028-0-381";"Some find it strange that I rarely trade with stronghold Orcs. I have no problem trading with Orcs, of course! But I've learned the Orcs who live in strongholds are like mages you find in caves: powerful, insular, and able to turn you inside out when they're having a bad day."
"219317028-0-382";"I always bribe the lighthouse keepers at a port. They're first to spot the ships, and can send runners with what they know of the shipmasters, their expected hauls, and the like. The best weapon is a keen mind, my mother always said! Also a dueling sword. She was rather particular."
"219317028-0-383";"I heard a version of Over the Seas last night called ""Ever the Tease and Over the Mane."" Things grew racier from there. You know how it is, lots of nautical phrases like ""half-mast"" and ""anchors aweigh"" taking on vastly different meanings. Sailors think they're so clever."
"219317028-0-384";"The dockworkers in Anvil made it abundantly clear I need to hire locals to staff my business. Tomorrow I have two choices: sift through the sotted dregs everybody else refused to hire, or watch the dockworkers throw everything I own into the harbor. I'm still weighing my options. That should tell you the quality I expect to find."
"219317028-0-385";"I interviewed ten candidates for assistants. All of them are terrible, but I must hire one or the dockworkers will acquaint my belongings with the sea. This is not unlike straining sewage with your teeth—no matter how bad it tastes, you must do your utmost to keep the biggest pieces of dung on the outside."
"219317028-0-386";"Wharf Dog Melloy, a Breton with a Khajiit-tail necklace. Low-Neck, an Argonian who says he is best at ""stealing things."" Cuts First, who beneath her extensive scars is either a spindly Nord or a stocky High Elf. I must hire one of them to appease the Anvil dockworkers. Very well! I'll give each a trial day and see who outworks the rest."
"219317028-0-387";"Cuts First threw a knife at me when I told her to move some barrels. I found Wharf Dog Melloy sleeping off the skooma shakes in my office. Low-Neck is missing, along with my ledger. Thankfully I'd hidden today's delivery, or he'd have made off with your package."
"219317028-0-388";"Low-Neck returned with my ledger this morning and said he was impressed with my volume of business. He promised to skim no more than a small portion of my profits. Better a candid thief than a throatcutter or a skooma fiend! I hired him on the spot. If you receive this package, it means my new assistant can take direction."
"219317028-0-389";"I heard a joke the other day. What do you call someone who rants about Dwarves who sew jewelry into the fringes of their robes? A Dwemer hemmer gem condemner! (I never said it was a good joke.)"
"219317028-0-390";"I watched a Wood Elf kill another Wood Elf today. She pulled a dagger, slipped up behind him, and cut his throat. Then she shouted something about ""avenging the black sap."" Her surprise when most everyone shrugged and went about their business marked her as an outsider. If the locals have no time to bet on a fight, its outcome doesn't matter."
"219317028-0-391";"I find it best to honor all of the Divines. Even Akatosh, who commands us to ""serve and obey the Emperor."" I tithe to him so he can settle that particular mess. Queen Ayrenn, Jorunn the Skald-King, High King Emeric, or someone else entirely. Perhaps even you! Whoever it is, emperors are good for business."
"219317028-0-392";"A dozen zombies shambled from the sea onto the Anvil docks. The entire crew of the Gizzard Cutter shrieked as one and fled for the hills! I'd heard of Redguard superstitions involving the undead, but never seen it in person. The Khajiiti crew of the Sleek Claws slew the zombies, then raided the Gizzard Cutter's hold. I admit, I'm still chuckling."
"219317028-0-393";"You may wonder why I am so diligent with the frequency and quantity of my deliveries at such an agreeable rate. Though this is certainly a service I provide, word of our association has provided multiple business opportunities for me. In a way, your reputation is funding your shipments!"
"219317028-0-394";"Have you heard the phrase ""squeeze blood from a stone,"" or some variation? I met a member of the Mages Guild who assures me this relates to some rather infamous gargoyle experiments. I'm not sure if I should believe him. He insisted Vanus Galerion was born a Snow Elf. I insisted he'd had too much to drink."
"219317028-0-395";"There's very little time to explain, but I must board a ship to Alik'r. Here is your latest package. If I am unable to contact you for the duration, my assistant Low-Neck will handle the next week's deliveries."
"219317028-0-396";"I made landfall in Khefrem. I expected a drier climate, but the western waters are quite refreshing. And now for the good news! I heard a rumor of a mage deep in the Alik'r wastes who trades incredibly exotic materials, but only when both moons are full—two days hence, according to the charts! Tomorrow I leave for his tower."
"219317028-0-397";"I knew the scorpions were large, but I didn't expect them to outsize the horses! Thankfully they turn with the grace of rowboats and lunge like drunken sailors, something I've long since grown accustomed to avoiding. The horse I rented knew more than enough to give the creatures a wide berth. I continue to the mage's tower!"
"219317028-0-398";"Bad news. The tower was entirely empty, but for a single table. Upon it was paper, pen, and inkwell. The paper said ""Petitioner's Trade"" at the top. Out of spite, I wrote ""the sleep you stole from me"" before bedding down in the tower. In the morning I sought the page as a souvenir, but it must have fluttered away in the night. So I took the pen!"
"219317028-0-399";"We return to Anvil with nearly empty hands. It was too good to be true, despite the assurances from sources I normally trust. At least I was able to turn a profit on barrels of dried fish. The spices alone will fund a backlog of shipments—such as this one."
"219317028-0-400";"Always pay your dues to the Thieves Guild! If you're protected, they're better than any city guard at finding who slipped a bolt of fine silk out of your warehouse. The last thing they want is independent competition."
"219317028-0-401";"A traveling merchant tried to sell some relics he claimed were taken from a Dark Anchor. He'd clearly never been to Anvil before he came, because the sailors here are quite superstitious. When they finished with him, he left town as a ""pitch goose."" This is why I always learn about my markets!"
"219317028-0-402";"The storms here are terrible! I'm not certain this package will reach you. If not, I shall double the volume of my next shipment. And if so, I hope you will forgive any unexpected sponginess."
"219317028-0-403";"A smith's apprentice tried to woo me the other day. I tried to let her down with grace. The extensive travel and associated dangers are poison to relationships. For now, my only love is business! Also, slippers made out of bear paws. So comfortable! If you ever make it to Orsinium, ask around."
"219317028-0-404";"A Fighters Guild contract led three imbeciles to slaughter a nearby Goblin tribe. This is the same tribe I'd paid to cull the harpies along the nearby caravan routes! If I were a cynical person, I'd think the Fighters Guild was looking for a more lucrative harpy contract. Did you know they charge twenty times what Goblins do? Maddening!"
"219317028-0-405";"Under no circumstances should you ask a Sea Elf to toss you a knotted line. You'd think they'd been trained at the same carnival, the way they all mimed reaching for their drawstrings. And most of them were women! I walked away. I have no interest in knowing just how different Maormer are from the rest of the Elves."
"219317028-0-406";"I received a strange delivery today. At first I thought it a returned shipment, for it was wrapped in the same packaging I use. But inside was a lacquered box, and within that an immaculate silvered cloth that unfolded to the size of a bedsheet. Was this a gift from you for my service? If so, thank you profusely! Such lovely patterns woven in."
"219317028-0-407";"I realize the silvered sheet was not sent from you—forgive my presumption. Still, it is a wonderful bedsheet! I did have the strangest dream last night. I was standing outside a citadel. I heard the strangest song, but I couldn't make out the words. If I could carry a tune I'd sing it. Perhaps I should try? No, no … I couldn't do it justice."
"219317028-0-408";"Today I woke just before dawn. I heard the song again! I can hum the notes, but the words aren't anything I recognize, and I speak four languages! Did I hear it in the citadel? I must have. I dreamt I was pounding at the door. Such a strange place. I think I'll take a nap after sending this package. The silvered sheet is so warm."
"219317028-0-409";"the words i understand the words for the song is the key to the doorway it spins and twitches and is perfection i must share the song with you it is my duty it is truth but i cannot send away the Argent Chord i must not part with the song or it will leave me the song is endless it must not end or all shall fade"
"219317028-0-410";"help me the singing is so loud make it stop"
"219317028-0-411";"I am Miss Firi's assistant, Low-Neck. She is very sick so I will be sending you packages until she gets better. She is a private person who would not want details of her sickness shared. Out of respect, I will not say she was found screaming and scratching at her ears in the small hours. Or that her wounds will mostly heal."
"219317028-0-412";"I am still Low-Neck, Miss Firi's assistant. She is very organized and has prepared many packages for you, to be sent if she is ever delayed on a journey. Her long rest is a delay, is it not? Therefore I will send you packages daily. Unless her journey takes longer than three weeks, at which point all I could send is her stockpile of calipers."
"219317028-0-413";"This is Low-Neck. While going through Miss Miss Firi's belongings I found a silvery cloth with black weaving. It smelled strange, like rotten eggs. I traded it for another stinky thing, a small barrel of salted fish which I left by her bedside. She hates the smell of salted fish, so perhaps it will help her wake."
"219317028-0-414";"Low-Neck again. Miss Firi is unable to pay me while she sleeps, so I took my wages from the strongbox where she stores her money. The locked one, beneath the locked trapdoor, under the junk-laden cart. The one with the old tapestries draped upon it. Did you know her decoy strongbox has more locks than the real one? She is a clever woman."
"219317028-0-415";"It is still Low-Neck writing, but not for much longer. I am pleased to say Miss Firi recovers. She no longer screams when she sees my face, so this is progress. It is now more of a whimpering, with occasional prayers to the Eight Divines. I tried wearing an amusing hat, but that led to more screams."
"219317028-0-416";"Please forgive my recent illness. I understand Low-Neck followed the instructions I left him in the event of my absence. I raised his salary, which is to say I agreed he could skim slightly more from my profits. I am still in poor health, but am still capable of continuing your shipments."
"219317028-0-417";"My assistant says you know more details of my illness than I first realized. If I said anything unsuitable, I beg your forgiveness. I still don't entirely understand what happened. I remember writing an angry letter to the Fighters Guild about harpies, and then it was weeks later. Perhaps the ink was poisoned? I'll have it checked, to be certain."
"219317028-0-418";"the singing the singing i can still hear it they never stop why won't they stop"
"219317028-0-419";"I can't find yesterday's shipment anywhere. Low-Neck insists he saw me hand it to the courier, but I have no recollection of doing so. Did you receive anything? Low-Neck has never lied to me before. Perhaps I need more rest. I assure you it will not affect my duties."
"219317028-0-420";"A great wave washed three ships into the Anvil docks. One went up in enormous gouts of blue flames. The other two—it was as though the ships began to scream, as though they could feel pain—and then it all stopped. All three carried some of my outgoing shipments, and now their captains refuse to sail."
"219317028-0-421";"Dozens of raiding ships returned to Anvil today. I hear their raid was a failure, which makes for tense streets. Low-Neck warns me to stay inside after dark, at least for the next few days. It seems when raiders lose a big fight, they like to pick many little ones."
"219317028-0-422";"Half a dozen Undaunted provoked some raiders. A tavern game got out of hand and they refused to back down. Usually these things end in a few broken teeth, but not today. I've never seen any hung from a mizzenmast's spars before. Today, I saw it happen six times."
"219317028-0-423";"Tragic news. At dawn, horsemen wearing Imperial armor rode down pilgrims traveling to a distant shrine of Arkay. I asked around this morning, but nobody knew any details—or even of the attack. Were the soldiers Imperial cavalry, or bandits wearing stolen armor? I suppose it doesn't matter when dozens lie dead."
"219317028-0-424";"I'm no longer allowed in my favorite tavern. Word of the massacred Arkay pilgrims arrived in Anvil last night. How could I have known yesterday morning? It happened while I slept! When pressed, I could not recall how I knew. I could tell they were afraid of me. Perhaps drink is the last thing I need right now."
"219317028-0-425";"Low-Neck said I was speaking Jel in my sleep. I'm not sure what should have me more concerned: that I was talking in the Argonian tongue, a language I've never learned, or that my assistant was in my bedroom as I slept. He insisted he was simply looking through my jewelry box for rings to steal. How is that supposed to reassure me?"
"219317028-0-426";"My apologies if this arrived with any delay. I couldn't locate my assistant so I had to manage this shipment myself. Low-Neck seems to disappear when there's trouble. I do hope he's all right."
"219317028-0-427";"I have left Anvil for good. It seems the raiders thought me cursed and feared I'd spread it to their ships. Before they could torch my warehouse, Low-Neck smuggled both my goods and myself onto a Dark Elf trading vessel. The crew here are devout, fearing nothing but the wrath of their three living gods. More later. We depart for Vvardenfell."
"219317028-0-428";"The Dark Elf vessel—the Graceful Netch—stopped briefly in Rivenspire. Blood fiends and civil war is all anyone could talk about in Northsalt Village. Also, strange happenings in the nearby city of Northpoint. I don't know the details, but I recommend avoiding uncivil blood fiends should you visit. For me, it's on to Vvardenfell."
"219317028-0-429";"We arrived at a House Hlaalu trading port with a name I can't pronounce. The night terrors were particularly bad last night. The captain of the Graceful Netch recommended I approach House Telvanni. He says if anyone can help me learn about my dreams, it will be them."
"219317028-0-430";"House Telvanni refused to join the Ebonheart Pact with their fellow Dark Elves if it meant giving up their practice of slavery. Yet these isolationist slavers are my only hope at stopping the dreams that haunt me. Should they decide I look better with a yoke around my neck, I've made arrangements with House Hlaalu to continue your shipments."
"219317028-0-431";"Good news! House Telvanni didn't enslave me. They asked me half a day's worth of questions, then sold me some potions they assured would suppress my dreams. All in all, a pleasant experience! Or it would have been, had they not been a pack of muck-eating, slaving bastards. If I'm lucky, I'll never deal with them again."
"219317028-0-432";"I rode a silt strider today. It was very peaceful. I'm not sure I care for how the drivers move them about by poking directly at their exposed innards, but the creatures don't seem to be in any pain."
"219317028-0-433";"It is all so strange here. Towers made of mushrooms. Gods you can meet. This strange obsession with ash which works its way into most of the food, I regret to report. Still, there is enough alike to the rest of Tamriel that I can still do business. And I've already cornered the market on kwama eggs!"
"219317028-0-434";"I don't like the sight of Red Mountain. It reminds me of my dreams."
"219317028-0-435";"I write this letter with a heavy heart. The dreams are growing worse. The potions I purchased from House Telvanni aren't working, and I fear I cannot continue in your employ as long as these strange dreams persist. I must consider my options. I will inform you before making any drastic alterations to our business arrangement."
"219317028-0-436";"I came to a decision. A friend once spoke of a wizard in Wrothgar who knows much of dreams. I will head there and see if this wizard can cure me. I hope the bracing air will reinvigorate me, for I do hope to continue as your outfitter for quite some time. I board a ship for colder waters this evening."
"219317028-0-437";"The snows of Wrothgar are indescribable. The mountains here are like enormous clenched fists dusted with great piles of flour. Skyrim Nords boast of their ranges, but nothing compares to these. Just a few more days to Orsinium! From there I will find the wizard who can cure my dreams."
"219317028-0-438";"Another bad dream last night. A million voices, screaming the same word over and over. I couldn't make it out. I suppose that's for the best."
"219317028-0-439";"I no longer travel to Orsinium. My mouth fills with the taste of copper whenever I take a step in that direction. I've petitioned a local shaman for aid in dispelling the dreams. I don't care what he thinks of a foreign High Elf standing outside his stronghold's walls. I just care that he trades knowledge for gold."
"219317028-0-440";"The shaman spoke of a hermit who cures ill dreams. This may be the wizard I seek. Before I head to the mountains, I must thank you for your indulgence. Speaking of this burden has helped lightened its load, and though we've never truly met, I feel a certain kinship. If I may impose upon you to wish me luck, I would be forever grateful."
"219317028-0-441";"Honored client! Due to unavoidable circumstances, Miss Firi is currently unable to personalize your delivery. Your regular shipments shall continue, of course! She anticipates the day when she can once more provide the personal touch she includes with her uninterrupted and reliable service."
"219317028-0-442";"Khajiit of lineage lost once roamed the land. Then came the Thrassian Plague. What culture, what martial arts, what woodcrafting technique must have been lost in its wake?  Pacrooti would give splenderous wood to visit the time of the 16 kingdoms, when Elsweyr of old was young. But that's impossible. So Pacrooti gives it to you, instead."
"219317028-0-443";"Khajiit are inclined towards a diet of sweets. And others judge them for it. Pacrooti once sat down to dinner with a Breton mercenary who glared at Pacrooti's plate and offered, ""My son also eats candies for breakfast."" Pacrooti barred his fangs and said, ""But your son is an ugly boy."" It pleased Pacrooti that the Breton did not like that."
"219317028-0-444";"Pacrooti could walk into an Imperial tea party with drooping fur that would make him the laughing stock of any Khajiiti village, and none would take heed. But fail to bathe for a few weeks and the Imperials become an unruly mob, hurling insults and objects. They are a fickle people. To Pacrooti, a few weeks dry adds character to the scent."
"219317028-0-445";"As Pacrooti collects these components for his dear friend, his mind wanders to the legendary artifacts of history like the Ring of Khajiit, which enabled Rajhin to become a literal god of theft. They say the ring is out there, somewhere in the wild. Pacrooti wonders if he will ever cross paths with it."
"219317028-0-446";"Pacrooti does not like taverns. He prefers to drink alone. Men and Mer are always spilling drinks, yelling immodesties. In the case of Mer, very subtle immodesties. One day, when component collecting becomes lucrative, Pacrooti will purchase a tavern where he will cover his customers in fur, then drench them in spirits."
"219317028-0-447";"Enjoy these components, friend. The creatures Pacrooti tore them from were fearsome, formidable--five-clawed, you might say. They were Breton children, the offspring of a lumberman! They bit, clawed, and hung off of every limb, and overwhelmed Pacrooti to take his stock. He had to sneak into their home in the dead of night to take it back."
"219317028-0-448";"This one's name is Pacrooti. Not Kitty. This one wishes that the rest of Tamriel could tell the difference between a pet and a person. One day, perhaps, the world outside of Elsweyr will feel like home. It is not this day. May these components serve you well, my friend."
"219317028-0-449";"These components Pacrooti collects for you take quite the commitment. There are dry days, where Pacrooti doesn't meet anyone with the pockets he needs, and there are bountiful days, when Khajiit finds a village of lumbermen! He could search the deeps and caves of Tamriel, but that sounds strenuous."
"219317028-0-450";"Pacrooti wants you to know that you are his favorite employer. You take in Pacrooti's letters with an aplomb that none of the others can manage. Pacrooti appreciates that. Otto Vincaedian, an Imperial employer, once asked if he could pay me to stop sending letters along with the components. Pacrooti did not like that."
"219317028-0-451";"This one tries not to have too much Moon Sugar because that's when the Golden Saints of Sheggorath make their presence known. The Golden Saints ruin everything in Tamriel, and are the only beings that taint even the general benevolence of Moon Sugar. They are the reason misfortune befalls the Khajiiti that over-consume."
"219317028-0-452";"Pacrooti often wonders what he would be like had he been born under a Full Moon. Such Khajiit become senche-tigers, sometimes bred as steeds. Pacrooti wagers he would make a swift, powerful senche-tiger, able to reach components much faster than he can today. Though, he supposes he would not be able to hold them. The universe can be cruel."
"219317028-0-453";"Though Khajiit sound harmonius to each other, Pacrooti's other friends say that Khajiiti singing sounds like the scraping of two rocks against glass. Pacrooti swears he has a voice like an Elvish bard of old after an ale or two. Enjoy your components. Though Pacrooti tried, the components were not paid for by Pacrooti's singing in the street."
"219317028-0-454";"Pacrooti is proud of his mane, but it looks better after a few days of travel. The natural styling that occurs after such time is incredible--five-clawed, even. The females don't seem to like the smell, but the females don't seem to like Pacrooti. This one hopes you receive the components well. Let them sit in the sun if they smell. It'll pass."
"219317028-0-455";"This one believes there is a beast in every Khajiit, no matter their calling or standing in life. And Lorkhaj help the one who awakens that beast! Pacrooti was forced to punish a Breton child when his tail was pulled today. The child screamed as if burnt alive as Pacrooti tied him down and recited excerpts from ""Civility and Etiquette: Khajiit."""
"219317028-0-456";"Pacrooti has always heard that Altmer Canonreeves are very well-bred. As with most things concerning politicians, Pacrooti did not understand what this meant. Pacrooti saw one in the street today, Justiciars in tow, carrying all her personal possessions and opening doors for her. Apparently, well-bred is a roundabout way to say handicapped."
"219317028-0-457";"Pacrooti would like you to know that the original owner of these components did not deserve them. They will have a much better home with you."
"219317028-0-458";"Show Pacrooti a wealthy Elf, and Pacrooti will show you a bigot who is snobbish about cuisine and lifestyle. Show Pacrooti a poor Elf, and Pacrooti will show you a bigot who is snobbish about cuisine and lifestyle. The Elves should learn to be more open-minded like the Khajiit. Please accept these components Pacrooti has obtained for you."
"219317028-0-459";"Sometimes Pacrooti becomes homesick and screams at the Moons, so his neighbors, some of whom are Khajiiti, decided to throw clubs and bludgeons at him instead of remarking. Pacrooti turned their gifts into components for you."
"219317028-0-460";"When Pacrooti is not collecting components, he dreams, sometimes, of teaching the way of unarmed combat to those not in the know. But the people laugh at Pacrooti and say their swords are all they need. They don't understand that, if Pacrooti wanted to, he could look them in the eye and rob them with their own blades at the same time."
"219317028-0-461";"Pacrooti hopes you find these components to your satisfaction. He met a spriggan head-on for them. In fact, these components were once a spriggan's head."
"219317028-0-462";"Pacrooti has heard of the Yokudan Sword Saints, or Ansei, who had mastered their sword techniques so thoroughly that they could access abilities similar to a mage's spells. Pacrooti imagines that his training in the way of the Whispering Fang requires similar mental and physical discipline, but the Whispering Fang has never helped him to fly."
"219317028-0-463";"Pacrooti spent his last coins on an eel pie this morning, and lacked the means to obtain a horse. A ferryman offered to take Pacrooti to your components, instead. Pacrooti walked. He despises water unless it's in his mouth."
"219317028-0-464";"The list of people Pacrooti would not trust with his top-quality components is longer than Pacrooti's tongue. Pacrooti wants you to know he refuses to do business with the finest bowcrafters in the land because he knows he will not have enough for you. Please continue to employ Pacrooti. He begs you."
"219317028-0-465";"Dear friend, Pacrooti thinks that he is in trouble. He has known for some time that he owes a great debt to a man in town known only as ""the Collector."" There were strange men in Pacrooti's room at the Rusty Lady this afternoon. He believes they were working for this Collector, who has been known to exact physical pain on those who don't pay."
"219317028-0-466";"Pacrooti is a master of the way of the Whispering Fang, and does not fear the Collector or his men, though he will not fight them if he does not have to. He does not want to have to hurt them, you see. So Pacrooti paid to ride on the back of a farmer's wagon today, covered in a blanket. It was very hot."
"219317028-0-467";"Pacrooti was cornered by the Collector's men today, and though they did not force him to unleash the Whispering Fang upon them, they did say they would give Pacrooti the chance to send this last shipment of components to you before Pacrooti would have to go with them. He hopes they reach you in a timely manner. esaelp dnes pleh"
"219317028-0-468";"Pacrooti finally met the Collector--who, to Pacrooti's astonished eyes, looked a lot like Pacrooti's cousin, Hadalit! That's because he was Pacrooti's cousin, Hadalit! All was forgiven and we clasped hands, though Hadalit insisted that I pay my debt. There is no debt between family, I told him. We fought in the street until he had all of my coin."
"219317028-0-469";"Pacrooti thinks he is a fairly clever Khajiit, but not as clever as the enlightened ones above who created Moon Sugar in the Tenmar Forest. He is pretty good at collecting components, though, and hopes these are of use to you."
"219317028-0-470";"To most Khajiit, Moon Sugar is a religious symbol--a tasty way to bring oneself closer to the gods. But Pacrooti just likes Moon Sugar. He is eating it all the time, the act of which is like a religion unto itself for Pacrooti. Don't worry. He still places component collecting higher in his priorities. Just dust these off, or you may attract flies."
"219317028-0-471";"Pacrooti knows he is the epitome of component collectors, but he has heard a pair of Redguard brothers are in contention for the title. Pacrooti has heard they specialize in enchantment components, but he has the feeling that his unique methods of collection will allow him to succeed even in other fields. Pacrooti just has to find those brothers."
"219317028-0-472";"Pacrooti won at a game of chance today, against another Khajiit named Twice-Lucky. She must not have been accustomed to losing, because she seemed twice-furious with this one! She did not seem to like it when Pacrooti said this out loud to her. He was trying to make conversation, but she started trying to turn Pacrooti into a rug. With a knife."
"219317028-0-473";"Depending on the Moons at time of birth, Khajiit of different standing and body emerge. We Khajiit are open to our lot in life, and act accordingly, unlike the scheming Men and Mer. Pacrooti is having a bad day. An Imperial and an Altmer skipped in line at the market, even though both knew Pacrooti was ahead of them."
"219317028-0-474";"Pacrooti hopes these components are to your satisfaction. They cost an arm and a leg to obtain. The arm and a leg of a spriggan! Pacrooti is proud of that one. Surviving a spriggan attack and the joke. Equally."
"219317028-0-475";"Pacrooti tracked a trio of Hagravens for days, hoping they would lead him to their dwelling, where components aplenty undoubtedly await. Pacrooti writes you now because they've stopped moving and are quiet. This one has heard silence from Hagravens means they are preparing to attack. He wonders who they will strike. There is no one else around!"
"219317028-0-476";"Pacrooti was attacked by the trio of Hagravens that he was stalking. He hoped they would lead him to their dwelling so he could acquire any components lying within, but they must have gleaned Pacrooti in the bushes. They pummeled Pacrooti with their fists and their magic, but Pacrooti wields the Whispering Fang. They were not the ones to walk away."
"219317028-0-477";"Pacrooti could not help himself and laughed as a short Altmer dismounted his horse today. He challenged Pacrooti to a duel, so Pacrooti hid in the shadows and emerged a ways down the road an hour later and beat him senseless. Pacrooti did not kill him, but took his sword in recompense. It paid for these components, and more!"
"219317028-0-478";"Stay away from Skooma, friend. Though it's popular among some Khajiit, today Pacrooti gleaned a Redguard male, one of the great component hunters of the region, one of the Scimitars of al-Babnab, under the influence of the vile substance. He shook, though not from sickness, and his bloodied eyes darted from side to side. Pacrooti hopes he survives."
"219317028-0-479";"Pacrooti would like you to know he works hard for you on a daily basis. Just today, he carried an entire shipment of components from old man Rickler's house to the courier. Pacrooti saved a lot of time; he found all of the components at old man Rickler's house."
"219317028-0-480";"Pacrooti thanked a bard for a song today, but the bard didn't hear, or didn't care to respond. Pacrooti stayed to find out, in case others thanked the bard. None did, and when the bard left the tavern, presumably to another venue, Pacrooti followed. After a while, the bard broke into a run, and Pacrooti did not bother chasing him. Bards are odd."
"219317028-0-481";"There are many hooligans in the places where Pacrooti eats. Other establishments won't serve him. As a result, Pacrooti is often the most esteemed diner. A component hunter amongst hardened criminals. Pacrooti eats quickly so he can write this letter. The customers will leave soon, with components that Pacrooti must take to give to you."
"219317028-0-482";"Pacrooti dislikes dealing with the undead. They are like animals, natural predators of the living. Despicable and opposite to the breathing world in every way. However, most undead were once living, and therefore, their resting places make plentiful repositories for components."
"219317028-0-483";"The Ring is a legendary artifact of the Khajiit, rumored to make the wearer impeccable in the ways of undetectable movement. Many say they would use it to change the course of the war, or exact vengeance on their enemies. Like all Khajiit, Pacrooti would embark on a burglaring spree."
"219317028-0-484";"One day, Pacrooti will discover the secret to crossing a river without getting wet. But it is not this day. Pacrooti even paid the ferryman double fare for a smoother ride! The ferryman failed. Pacrooti hopes you enjoy your components. They, fortunately, were in a pack, and therefore, dry. Not so for Pacrooti."
"219317028-0-485";"Pacrooti has always wondered how much a mage utilizes the practice of their art in life. Pacrooti is a master of the Whispering Fang, and its techniques, like a fine mist, make its way into everything Pacrooti does. Pacrooti forgoes the stairs, for instance, when he could climb a tree, instead. Do mages fly when faced with stairs?"
"219317028-0-486";"Pacrooti does not know if he will ever find true love outside of Moon Sugar. Pacrooti tries to be careful during meals, but please remember to dust your components before using them. Apologies."
"219317028-0-487";"There is nothing Pacrooti can do about not knowing how to swim. He refuses to get in the water, and will never learn. There may be worse things than being submerged head to toe in water, but Pacrooti does not know what that may be. Perhaps a plane of Oblivion. Enjoy these components, which Pacrooti nearly drowned to deliver."
"219317028-0-488";"When Pacrooti wants to, he can make himself very hidden. But he does so through dint of cunning and tremendous flexibility. The Moons know what Pacrooti has done to hide from the town guards. But what do mages care for hard work and sweating? Nothing! With a word they accomplish the same thing! Now Pacrooti must pickpocket some more components."
"219317028-0-489";"Pacrooti thinks that you are the best employer he has ever had. You never have a pejorative word to say against Pacrooti. He truly appreciates that."
"219317028-0-490";"Pacrooti does not know when this shipment will reach you, but he hopes you find the components well. For once in his life, Pacrooti chased a spriggan instead of the other way around. With firebrand in hand, Pacrooti terrorized it for all the times the spriggan's sisters terrorized Pacrooti. It ran off a cliff and became the components you hold."
"219317028-0-491";"Pacrooti has no patience for those who would turn travelers away on a torrential night like tonight. This one has allowed three Breton mercenaries to stay in Pacrooti's room until morning. Pacrooti will send you components with this letter if there are any in their packs or pants."
"219317028-0-492";"Pacrooti wonders why the skeletal undead bother to harass him. They don't eat, and they don't make friends or enemies, they just bother Pacrooti whenever he's nearby. What must these people have been in life? Probably the worst people Pacrooti has never met. Pacrooti does not think of himself as intolerant, but the undead disgust him."
"219317028-0-493";"Pacrooti has many friends, but he is not sure if they like Pacrooti. There is Luna the baker, Liam the blacksmith, and Timeo the fisherman, whom Pacrooti regularly transacts with. Their hands clutch their purses like Hagraven talons when Pacrooti is near, even though he has told them many times that he is not component hunting when he visits them."
"219317028-0-494";"A Nord female challenged Pacrooti to a bare-fisted fight today. This one knows there is no easy way out of a tavern fight with Nords, so he wasted no time in responding to her and began swinging. She was heavily inebriated, and though Pacrooti ravaged her with rabbit punches and dirty kicks, she felt nothing. Pacrooti quickly surrendered."
"219317028-0-495";"Sometimes Pacrooti wonders whether the tales of Dragons were true or not. Creatures that snort fire seem like they would be very dangerous, indeed. This one does not think the people of Tamriel could have survived in a world where such beasts regularly patrolled the skies."
"219317028-0-496";"Pacrooti would make a great Altmer. He would spend all his days walking with his chest puffed out and bragging about all the great things he had accomplished on any given day. Like getting out of bed."
"219317028-0-497";"Please make good use of these components, dear friend. Pacrooti had to fight a terrifying Dwarven machine to get to them. No one in town had any. Pacrooti checked everywhere. Including the houses."
"219317028-0-498";"Speaking in the first-person is something Pacrooti will never be able to grasp, he thinks. Pacrooti has trouble understanding those Khajiit who have mastered that nuance of the common tongue. Combining that speech with a Khajiiti rasp and accent, and it sounds to Pacrooti like a little man or mer speaking out of a Khajiit face. Most disturbing."
"219317028-0-499";"Another shipment of components for you, dear friend. Pacrooti wants you to know how much he appreciates you, and included the usual amount of components (more or less) even though the town guards confiscated a large portion of Pacrooti's hunt. With this many guards on patrol, Pacrooti wonders how the component hunters make coin in this place."
"219317028-0-500";"Pacrooti's current landlord is very arrogant. The landlord looks down on the things that Pacrooti does to earn pay, even though the landlord never refuses rent. If the landlord knew he was paying Pacrooti's rent for him, he would be even unhappier at Pacrooti."
"219317028-0-501";"Every time Pacrooti smashes a Dwarven contraption into malfunction, he wishes there were a way to salvage them, make them wait at his beck and call. With a little paste and some dishes, the spinning hammers of a Dwarven centurion would become a marvelous serving device."
"219317028-0-502";"Pacrooti's friends were bragging today about their horses, arguing about whose was swiftest. If Pacrooti had the money, he would purchase a senche-tiger to ride. They are more cordial than horses, and Pacrooti can read the mood on their faces. They are not unlike Pacrooti. But horses have a cunning stare that Pacrooti does not like."
"219317028-0-503";"It's me, Valinka Stoneheaver. You know, the one you hired to source components for your use. You still want the stuff, right? I've included a sample. I can't thank you enough for this opportunity. This job will really help me pursue my true calling - delver of dungeons and collector of ancient relics! Not what you'd expect from a Nord, huh?"
"219317028-0-504";"Valinka again. I hope this package finds you well. Me? I've been better. My brothers are giving me grief about my chosen profession. They say it isn't proper for a Nord maiden to rummage around the countryside, collecting components and crawling around ancient ruins. But what do those horkers know? I'm so angry right now I could punch a mammoth!"
"219317028-0-505";"Sorry this shipment is late. Who knew mammoths were such sensitive creatures? I barely gave it a love tap, but it went rampaging through the town square like I really hurt it or something. It took forever to calm it down and clean up the mess. Good thing mammoths like mead-soaked fruit balls. But all my brothers could do was laugh, the horkers!"
"219317028-0-506";"I know, I know. Late again. But at least the components arrived, right? I had another incident with my brothers. It involved a lot of mead and a few well-placed blows to the head. Milk-drinkers! They never could best me in a fair fight! Still, I think I'll go farther afield for your next shipment. Give us all a little time to cool off."
"219317028-0-507";"Who do you love? Valinka, that's who! Look at what I was able to find for you this time. Premium grade materials, if I do say so myself. And I discovered a new ruin to explore. I'll tell you all about it when I send your next shipment."
"219317028-0-508";"That ruin I told you about? Turned out to be some Orc's hovel. And he wasn't very happy to find me inside and digging through his stuff. Who knew Orc hovels looked so much like ancient ruins? Live and learn, I guess."
"219317028-0-509";"I shared a fire with a camp of Argonians. After a few cups of some foul-tasting beverage they obviously enjoyed more than I did, they loosened up enough to tell me about a ruin they had passed in their travels. Finally, a real lead to a dungeon! But don't despair. I won't neglect my duties to you while I delve into the unknown."
"219317028-0-510";"Dear patron, please accept this latest shipment of components. Now, to other matters. I must tell you how the search for the ruins goes. Those Argonians provided the strangest directions. Something about how melting water flows to the maw of the ruins or some such. I thought I was wandering in circles, but then—oh! More later. I have to run now."
"219317028-0-511";"Sorry about that. I really had to run! And those horkers that were chasing me were fast! But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning. When I was a little girl with pigtails—no, that's too far back. I found the dungeon the Argonians told me about! And it was right where they said it would be. More or less."
"219317028-0-512";"Valinka here, with more components and another report about my quest to become the greatest explorer in Tamriel. I'm going to be even better than that show-off, Narsis Dren! I found the ruins. Only a half-crumbled tower of rock jutted from the ground, but I was sure that the structure continued beneath the surface. That's when the Orc spotted me."
"219317028-0-513";"Who knew Orcs could run so fast? I was hoping for Dwarven or Daedric relics, but it turns out the ruins were old Nord in origin. The Orcs were using the place as a hideout. They were obviously bandits, and obviously mean. I was able to double back and sneak in while the Orcs were out looking for me. That's when I saw the—oops, got to go!"
"219317028-0-514";"More components, as requested. Now where was I? Oh, yes. The Orc bandits were using the ancient Nord ruin as a hideout. While they were out looking for me, I returned to look around their hideout. It was a single stone chamber beneath the crumbling tower. Hardly a proper ruin at all. And locked in a small metal cage in one corner was a mangy dog."
"219317028-0-515";"When the mangy dog saw me, it whined pitifully. Now, I'm not some milk-drinker with a soft spot for furry animals, but something about the dog touched my heart. He had a noble bearing and a fire in his eyes. And who hasn't found themselves locked in a cage after a night of mead and good cheer? So I did the only reasonable thing—I opened the cage."
"219317028-0-516";"That was when the first of the bandits returned. He was a fat Orc with rotting leather armor and a thick mace hanging from his belt. He was as surprised to see me as I was to see him. We both reached for our weapons. But before we could draw on each other, the dog burst from the opened cage and charged right for the Orc's—um, delicates."
"219317028-0-517";"I hope my tale isn't boring you, patron. Here are more components, as requested. These would never have reached you if not for that mangy dog. ""Plucky"" clamped sharp teeth on that fat Orc's … private parts … giving me time to unsling my warhammer and bring the business end down with all my might. The Orc dropped like a sack of rabbit meatballs."
"219317028-0-518";"Speaking of rabbit meatballs, that dog Plucky certainly likes the spicy little orbs of tastiness. And who can blame him? I was feasting on the things myself when Plucky helped himself to a meatball or three. Now he can't get enough of the delicious spheroids of rabbity goodness. I must stock up the next time I'm in a town or city."
"219317028-0-519";"It's me again. Valinka Stoneheaver. And Plucky, the brave dog! We escaped the Orc bandits and have left the Nord ruins behind us. Now we're back to tracking down crafting components for you, full time. Well, at least until we hear about another ruin to explore. Enjoy this shipment, with our compliments!"
"219317028-0-520";"While gathering the components for this shipment, I heard the most amazing news. My hero, the famous delver of dungeons, Narsis Dren, is going to be visiting the city in a few days. And even better, he's going to give a talk at the inn about his latest adventure! I think I'm going to hang around so I can meet him."
"219317028-0-521";"Here you go. I hope this suffices, but I didn't want to range too far afield while Narsis Dren is visiting the city. He is my hero, after all. I plan to be just like him! Well, maybe half as good. He is the preeminent dungeon explorer of our time, so I need to set my sights accordingly. I'll tell you all about his talk next time."
"219317028-0-522";"Just wanted to get this off to you before Narsis Dren takes the stage at the inn. Oh! There he is! For a Dark Elf, he doesn't look half bad. Got to go!"
"219317028-0-523";"What an amazing tale Narsis Dren told us! The inn was packed. It seemed like the whole city wanted to see the famous explorer and hear what he had to say. You should have heard his story about the time he was trapped in an Ayleid ruin by a group of Daedric cultists. It was so exciting!"
"219317028-0-524";"After Narsis Dren got away from the Daedric cultists (what a tale that was!), he read an excerpt from his new book, Narsis Dren and the Lost Ruins of Salinvord. I can't wait to get a copy and see how he escaped from the atronachs! I must sound like a unbloodied cub before her first battle, but I can't help it. He's so … intense!"
"219317028-0-525";"How embarrassing! I can't believe I looked up to that skeever! After his talk, I went up to Narsis Dren and asked him to sign a copy of his book, Dungeon-Delving Secrets. He said, ""Sure, right after you come to my room and examine my artifact."" You know, for a famous adventurer, he dropped like a sack of rabbit meatballs when I hit him."
"219317028-0-526";"Hi. It's me. Valinka. Sorry about going on and on about Narsis Dren. Turns out, he's just like most of the stupid males I've ever met and not a hero or anything. I'm not opposed to a good romp in the hay, so to speak, but a woman likes to be won over, you know? Like in those poems by Fjokki the Bard? Anyway, here's your shipment."
"219317028-0-527";"Valinka has a new mission in life. I plan to become an even greater dungeon explorer than that diseased skeever, Narsis Dren. And I may have a lead on just the dungeon to explore. Turns out, Dren dropped a scrap of parchment when I socked him in the nose. I didn't notice it, but Plucky picked it up and brought it to me. It's a map!"
"219317028-0-528";"Even hear of a place called Bthunzel? Neither did I. But that's where this map that Narsis Dren dropped seems to be pointing. And it's covered with notes like ""Dwarven ruin?"" ""Never explored!"" and ""Treasure?"" Needless to say, Valinka is one excited horker. But I promise to fulfill the terms of our contract—no matter how famous I may become."
"219317028-0-529";"While purchasing supplies in a small town—the closest town to the spot marked on Dren's map—I accidentally mentioned that I was a relic hunter of some renown. A small exaggeration, I grant you, but I was anxious and excited. But now I think I'm being followed! I sure am glad I have Plucky with me. He's such a good dog! Oh, enjoy the shipment!"
"219317028-0-530";"I hope this shipment of components finds you well. I continue to travel toward the ruins of Bthunzel, intent on reaching the place as soon as I can. As for thinking that I was being followed, it must have been a false alarm. I haven't seen any sign of cultists or bandits since I left the town. Plucky, however, continues to seem ill at ease."
"219317028-0-531";"The oddest thing happened. I was just settling into my camp for the night—after a fine day of gathering components for your use, I might add—when Plucky started barking and ran off into the darkness. As I write this, he still hasn't returned. I feel like a horker waiting for the butcher's cleaver. But he's probably just chasing a rabbit, right?"
"219317028-0-532";"Oh, patron, what should I do? I woke up to find a note pinned to the tree above my sleeping mat. ""We have your dog,"" it says. ""If you want to see him alive again, tell us the location of the ruins."" And it was signed by Narsis Dren's infamous nemesis, Morella the Cruel. Oh, what should I do? By the way, your components are included."
"219317028-0-533";"I am not ready to have a nemesis of my own! Especially not one powerful enough to threaten the mighty Narsis Dren for so many years. Still, Plucky needs me. He's a good dog and he doesn't deserve to be left in the hands of the evil Morella the Cruel. Excuse the quality of this shipment, but as you can see I have a lot on my mind of late."
"219317028-0-534";"The clearing near the river is a perfect place to stage an ambush. I know I'm walking into a trap, but what choice do I have? I have to try to save Plucky from the villainous Morella the Cruel. But my parents didn't raise a milk-drinker. I have a plan of my own. I'll tell you all about it. Next time. Wish me luck!"
"219317028-0-535";"Remember the time I punched the mammoth? I learned a valuable lesson that day—mammoths love mead-soaked fruit balls! As it happens, I'm carrying a pouch full of the delicious sweets at this very moment. And that gives me an idea for how to approach my meeting with Morella the Cruel. Oh, and more components are included with this missive."
"219317028-0-536";"I entered the clearing cautiously. Plucky was tied to a stake, growling at the woman beside him. She wasn't as tall as me, but for a Breton lass she was taller than average. By her manner and her impeccable outfit, I knew she was Morella the Cruel. There were six thugs with her. ""I hope you plan to cooperate,"" she said, tugging on Plucky's tether."
"219317028-0-537";"Valinka here. Please find another shipment of components included with this letter. And in case you were getting anxious about it, Plucky is back with me, all safe and sound. Now that the suspense is out of the way, let me tell you what happened. But next time. We're still trying to put some distance between ourselves and Morella's gang."
"219317028-0-538";"So there I was, in the clearing facing down Morella the Cruel and her gang of thugs. I want to tell you how I said something witty, dispatched the evil-doers, and rescued Plucky. What actually happened was a lot more chaotic. And it all started when I tossed the pouch with the remaining mead-soaked fruit balls to Morella."
"219317028-0-539";"Morella the Cruel caught the pouch of mead-soaked fruit balls. The look on her face told me it was reflex and not a desire for one of the luscious treats that drove her dexterity. As the ground began to shake and Morella's eyes went wide with panic, I quickly grabbed Plucky's leash and ran from the clearing. That's when the mammoth arrived."
"219317028-0-540";"Getting a mammoth to follow you isn't as hard as you might imagine. Since they share a particular fondness for mead-soaked fruit balls with Nords, I'm surprised more of us don't have a line of the giant beasts tagging along behind us. Of course, a hungry mammoth was the last thing Morella the Cruel expected to charge into the clearing that day."
"219317028-0-541";"Plucky and I watched from the tree line as the mammoth trampled through the clearing, trying to get to the mead-soaked fruit balls I tossed to Morella the Cruel. We stayed just long enough to make sure Morella and her gang were fully engaged, then we ran as fast as we could. I guess Bthunzel will have to wait until things calm down."
"219317028-0-542";"Another town, another tavern. A letter caught up with me when I arrived. From my brother, Olgath. He never could put two sentences together, so the meaning of the missive wasn't perfectly clear. But I got the intent. He wants me to come home to attend some sort of celebration. Don't worry. This won't affect the shipment of your components."
"219317028-0-543";"What a pain in the arse! I just want to find a fast way to travel back home but I run into obstacles at every turn! Did you ever try to get a portal from those stuffed robes in the Mages Guild? They charge a small fortune if you aren't one of their milk-drinking band of book readers! I guess I'll just have to keep looking."
"219317028-0-544";"A Khajiit trader! Such wonders I've seen since accepting your contract. And he's even willing to allow me to travel with his caravan—all the way back home. If all goes well, I should arrive in time to attend the celebration, even though I couldn't tell from Olgath's letter what we're celebrating."
"219317028-0-545";"Yadus the Khajiit trader tells such wonderful stories. I never know how much to believe, but they're always amusing and he seems so sincere. He also appears quite fond of Plucky and the two definitely enjoy each other's company. I also made a number of connections that should keep you stocked with components for some time to come. You're welcome!"
"219317028-0-546";"I got to see a trade caravan in operation. From procuring goods at one location, to selling goods at another, these lessons will prove invaluable in expanding my own procurement services. I'm not sure about dealing with the general public, though. Yadus never gets angry, no matter how a customer behaves—while I just want to hit most of them."
"219317028-0-547";"Plucky and I said our farewells to Yadus the Khajiit trader today. It was with more than a touch of sadness that we parted ways, but at least I'm back in Skyrim. As promised, here's another shipment of components. Now I need to find my brothers and figure out why it was so important I drop everything and return home."
"219317028-0-548";"By all the snow in the Nine Holds, I can't believe what my brothers have done to me! Do you know why they called me home? Do you know what we're celebrating? My marriage! Oblivion take the horkers, I don't want to get married! I'm just furious about this! Oh, and here are your components."
"219317028-0-549";"I seriously want to crack skulls together! In order to settle a debt my foolish brothers have accumulated in my absence, they decided to marry me to old Thorgrim Wartnose. They think to sell me as so much cattle? Well, think again! And Olgath gave the amulet of Mara to me! My brother! It wasn't even presented properly—not that it matters, anyway."
"219317028-0-550";"Dear patron. I am not some commodity to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. If and when I decide to accept the amulet of Mara and enter into marriage, it will be of a time and place of my choosing—and with someone I desire. It will certainly NOT be with old Thorgrim Wartnose! Now to tell my brothers what they can do with their ""celebration."""
"219317028-0-551";"Another typical family reunion for the Stoneheavers. It involved a lot of yelling, three separate altercations, plenty of bruises, a few broken bones, and gallons of mead. Great times! I love these get-togethers! And I think I got my point across. Olgath will have to figure out another way to clear his debts, because I'm not getting married today."
"219317028-0-552";"So I didn't marry old Thorgrim, but the celebration wasn't a total loss. We got to talking, and one thing led to another, and … well, I let him show me his artifact, if you catch my meaning. Hey, I'm a healthy Nord woman. I'm young and I have … needs. And the poor old horker isn't all bad. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-553";"Dear patron. Plucky and I are back on the road, following up on some component source leads I gathered while traveling with Yadus the trader. I may even head back toward Bthunzel, provided I don't run into Morella the Cruel and her gang again. I'm feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and ready to go!"
"219317028-0-554";"I came across an odd sight in the wilderness today. A circle of stones stood in an otherwise empty clearing, and strange runes were inscribed on the ground. It was eerily silent in the clearing, but also surprisingly peaceful. Plucky refused to approach the circle, but I decided to sit within it and take a short rest."
"219317028-0-555";"Not much to say today. I'm just sitting in this circle of stones, taking a short rest. I think I hear Plucky barking, but he sounds so very far away."
"219317028-0-556";"I must have dozed off. When I woke up, I was still sitting in the circle of stones, but someone was kind enough to leave a mug of some kind of liquid in the circle with me. How nice of them! I hope it's mead. I suddenly realized I have a powerful thirst. But why is Plucky still barking at me?"
"219317028-0-557";"Bad dog, Plucky! Bad dog! He leaped into the circle of stones and knocked the mug from my hand before I could take so much as a sip of the sweet-smelling liquid. Well, that's interesting. The spilled liquid sizzles and steams as it melts strange patterns in the ground. Perhaps Plucky is a good dog after all."
"219317028-0-558";"It took some effort and a few not-so-gentle nips from Plucky's sharp teeth, but I finally stumbled out of the circle of stones. The place cast some sort of spell over me, but now that I'm outside the circle I can already feel the fog lifting from my mind. It's time to leave this place—and find a worthy treat for Plucky!"
"219317028-0-559";"Dear patron. Forgive my tardiness and the tone of my last few letters. Obviously, I was not myself due to the spell cast by that strange circle of stones. I promise I'll be more careful in the future. Please find the components I've included with this message."
"219317028-0-560";"I met the most interesting Argonian. A traveling alchemist, Aleet-Uka. I encountered him on the road, beside his small cart with its potions and reagents. We got to talking and realized we were heading in the same direction, so he invited me to accompany him. After that incident with the circle of stones, I find the lizard's presence comforting."
"219317028-0-561";"Aleet-Uka enjoys showing off his alchemy expertise. He mixed together some foul-smelling components and handed me the concoction. He was extremely pleased with himself, explaining that when poured into an alcoholic beverage, the potion would prevent the imbiber from getting drunk. Really? What's the point of that? Oh. I hurt Aleet's feelings."
"219317028-0-562";"For a creature one step removed from a pair of boots, Aleet-Uka's feelings are easily bruised. I spend most of my time trying to make up for the latest innocent remark I uttered that sent the poor alchemist into a deep depression. Perhaps I should just accept his worthless potions without offering any opinions. But where's the fun in that?"
"219317028-0-563";"I have to admit, Aleet-Uka's latest potion might actually serve a useful purpose. He said he was trying to craft an elixir of flight so that he could soar above the mountain peaks. Instead, the potion seems to attract birds to the imbiber. We ate well after all those wild geese perched upon Aleet's head and shoulders. Easiest hunt I ever had!"
"219317028-0-564";"With a tinge of regret, I bid farewell to the alchemist Aleet-Uka today. He decided to continue on, while I needed to see a man about a rumor in the little village on the hill. Turns out, he may have a lead on another ruin I can investigate. In the meantime, enjoy this shipment of components!"
"219317028-0-565";"On the way to the village on the hill, Plucky decided to run off and chase a rabbit. Stupid dog thinks that if he catches the rabbit, it will magically give him rabbit meatballs—cooked and ready to eat! If only that were true. Maybe if we catch a few of the long-eared creatures, I can find a cook in town who knows how to prepare the delicacy."
"219317028-0-566";"I followed Plucky as he chased the rabbit, but a strange noise ahead gave me pause. I drew my weapon and approached, using what cover I could to conceal my presence. From my hiding place, I saw a sight that made my blood run cold. Daedric cultists! Three robed figures tossed nets over both Plucky and the rabbit. And the day had started so well."
"219317028-0-567";"How do I get myself into these situations? Now I have to save Plucky and his rabbit from a trio of Daedric cultists who are preparing to begin some kind of ritual. And Plucky and the rabbit are the main components in the foul ceremony! Think, Valinka, think! There has to be something—wait, Aleet's potion! I have an idea …."
"219317028-0-568";"Oh, patron! You should have seen the cultists' faces as I came storming into their camp with a flock of birds. Aleet's potion worked amazingly well, attracting winged creatures of all shapes and sizes. They surrounded me like a cloud of wings and talons—like the fury of Kyne herself burst upon them! Now if I had only planned my next move."
"219317028-0-569";"I charged the cultists, surrounded by all manner of birds attracted to me after I drank Aleet's potion. Now we stared at each other, the cultists confused and nervous, me unsure how best to proceed with my daring plan to rescue Plucky and the rabbit. My moment of surprise was quickly evaporating, but I didn't have a clue as to what to do next."
"219317028-0-570";"All in all, I was beginning to feel a bit silly, what with a flock of birds surrounding me and no clear idea how to finish my daring rescue of Plucky and the rabbit. That was when I think Kyne herself lent a hand. A huge eagle swooped out of the sky. It frightened the other birds so much that they exploded away from me—and right into the cultists!"
"219317028-0-571";"The eagle scattered the birds in all directions. Then the eagle swooped again, this time right at the three Daedric cultists. I barely hefted my warhammer and got in a couple of whacks before the cultists began to run. The cowards! Not to miss my opportunity, I released Plucky and the rabbit. Then we fled toward the village on the hill."
"219317028-0-572";"In honor of our adventure together, Plucky and I decided to let the rabbit go on its merry way. It considered us for a moment, then tipped its head as if acknowledging our gesture. Plucky whined a bit as his hope for rabbit meatballs hopped away, but it was the right thing to do. Your components are included, as per our agreement."
"219317028-0-573";"I found the man I was seeking in the little village on the hill. He's a Dark Elf. Goes by the name of Ilton Beran. He collects lore of all kinds—fascinating and historical facts from across all of Tamriel. If anyone can point me in the direction of an ancient ruin, it's going to be Ilton Beran. I have an appointment to meet with him tomorrow."
"219317028-0-574";"Ilton Beran is an infuriating little man. Small even for an Elf, he carries himself as though he were a giant. And does he love the sound of his own voice! I came close to driving a dagger into my ear on multiple occasions, as he went on and on about one obscure fact after another.  But eventually he got to the subject I originally asked about."
"219317028-0-575";"""The Indaren ruins,"" Ilton Beran said with a dramatic flair. ""You will not find a more haunted location—or a more dangerous one."" Turns out, the Indarens were a wealthy family of Dark Elves who lived in a huge mansion a hundred or so years ago. And then something happened to them, but I had stopped listening by that point in the story."
"219317028-0-576";"What a long-winded blowhard! But at least Ilton Beran was true to his reputation. He provided me with exacting directions to the haunted ruins known as Indaren Manor. He mentioned ghosts and lost treasure and something about unspeakable danger, but who can remember all those boring facts when there's adventure waiting? Components are included."
"219317028-0-577";"This could be it, patron. This could be the adventure that elevates me above that pretender, Narsis Dren. All I have to do is slip into the ruins of Indaren Manor, avoid the ghosts and untold dangers, and find at least one piece of the lost treasure. Easy as melting snow in a blacksmith's furnace! Wish me luck!"
"219317028-0-578";"Who knew ghosts could be so touchy about their state of existence. And Dark Elf ghosts? Well, they're the only ghosts I've ever encountered, but it seems to me they must be the worst of the bunch. When I refused to show the least bit of fear at their spooky mischief, they became sullen and withdrawn. All except for the Veiled Lady."
"219317028-0-579";"I was exploring the haunted ruins of Indaren Manor when I encountered a most terrifying spirit—the Veiled Lady. This regal Dark Elf floated above the wrecked remains of the manor's banquet hall. I could see right through her, but her face was hidden behind a veil of gossamer ghost-silk. Her soft, piercing voice asked, ""Why are you here?"""
"219317028-0-580";"The Veiled Lady's question was appropriate. After all, I had invaded her manor without permission. But none of the other ghosts I encountered hindered my advance, so I didn't expect this one to prove troublesome. ""I seek the lost Indaren treasure,"" I said. Suddenly, the air around the spirit churned and swirled, and her veil pulled back to reveal—"
"219317028-0-581";"I can't describe the ghostly visage revealed when the Veiled Lady's shawl parted. Really. I've tried. The words come out as gibberish and the letters as undecipherable runes. But I can tell you that the sight frightened me to my very core. I was a child again, standing helpless before an angry spirit. And the spirit was drawing closer."
"219317028-0-582";"I was deep in the ruins of Indaren Manor, held fast by fear and the ghostly power surrounding the Veiled Lady. I couldn't even draw my weapon, for all the good it would do against the spirit. ""You have found only doom,"" she moaned, her voice a winter wind whispering through the eaves. I closed my eyes, happy that Plucky was safe in the village."
"219317028-0-583";"Something had changed. I opened one eye to see the Veiled Lady's shawl was back in place and she had stopped moving. There, between us, stood a rabbit. I couldn't be sure, but I think it was the one I rescued from the cultists. It was locked in a contest of stares with the ghost, thereby shattering the spell that held me. So I ran."
"219317028-0-584";"Dear patron. I wasn't able to recover the lost treasure of Indaren Manor. However, I did learn a valuable lesson. Sometimes an act of kindness can save your life—no matter how delicious the rabbit meatballs may be. Or something like that. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-585";"On the road again, and I find myself heading in the direction of the Bthunzel ruins. You'd think that my encounter with the Veiled Lady would have cured me of my fascination with dungeons and adventures, but you'd be wrong. I'm a Nord! Adventure is what we live for! And mead. We love mead."
"219317028-0-586";"I came across an impromptu camp alongside the road. Tents and merchant stalls had been hastily assembled, and the place had the feel of a carnival or bazaar. The festive mood and genuine excitement of the crowd drew me in, and it wasn't long before I was trying to decide what tasty morsels to sample and which heady brews to drink."
"219317028-0-587";"I've met some intriguing people in my journeys, but few have been as bright and fun-loving as Karamel Little-Leaf. I bumped into the Wood Elf at the Seven Traders Bazaar, the traveling carnival I told you about. She's quick with quips and jokes, and she knows how to acquire free drinks—especially when the buyers are male!"
"219317028-0-588";"Karamel Little-Leaf may be my favorite person ever! Even Plucky likes her! We're having a grand old time at the Seven Traders Bazaar. She knows which brewers serve the most potent mead, and she's personal friends with a cook who makes the most amazing rabbit meatballs. She keeps hinting that she has something to ask me. I wonder what it is."
"219317028-0-589";"Why do these things keep happening to me, patron? I hate to burden you with my problems, but you seem to be a good listener. And you do owe me for all the components I send your way. Turns out, Karamel Little-Leaf is a thief! She asked me to help her rob the Seven Traders Bazaar. Oh, what a terrible turn of events!"
"219317028-0-590";"I never had a friend like Karamel Little-Leaf, but I won't be pressured into a life of crime. I reluctantly told her I couldn't help her. Not with her scheme to rob the bazaar, at any rate. I can't believe how weepy I got. Not proper Nord behavior at all! But Little-Leaf gave me a good hug and said she understood. She really is a good friend."
"219317028-0-591";"I'm drowning my guilt in mead. I didn't help Little-Leaf, but I also decided not to warn the merchants, either. Now I feel guilty about doing absolutely nothing! Karamel succeeded at robbing the bazaar. She smiled and blew me a kiss before she disappeared into the wilderness. I hope I see her again. I miss her already."
"219317028-0-592";"Plucky has been trying to lift my spirits, but things haven't been the same since Karamel Little-Leaf went away. The high-spirited little Wood Elf really grew on me. You know what I need? I need an adventure! I think it's finally time to investigate the Dwarven ruins of Bthunzel! Now, where did I put Narsis Dren's map?"
"219317028-0-593";"I'm so angry with Karamel Little-Leaf right now! Do you know what she did when she hugged me? She stole my map to the Bthunzel ruins! The same one I … acquired … from Narsis Dren! She tricked me. Like I was some milk-drinking Breton wench and not a Nord warrior maiden. There will be a reckoning. Of that, you can be sure!"
"219317028-0-594";"Even without a map, I remember the general vicinity of the Bthunzel ruins. If I hurry, I might even be able to catch up with that little thief, Karamel. We'll see how well her jokes and the way she smiles and the funny way she tilts her head serves her when I wrap my fingers around her skinny Wood Elf neck! Your components are included."
"219317028-0-595";"Plucky and I have sneaked up on a camp not far from where I think the ruins of Bthunzel are located. It's worse than I imagined! I found Karamel Little-Leaf—and she's sharing a drink with Morella the Cruel and her thugs! I guess our meeting at the bazaar wasn't an accident. It appears the Wood Elf thief works for Narsis Dren's nemesis!"
"219317028-0-596";"I guess I have a nemesis now. Maybe even two. It appears that Morella the Cruel and Karamel Little-Leaf are working together to find the ruins of Bthunzel before I do. And they stole the map that I stole in order to beat me to it! I may just be mad enough to do something reckless. In true Nord tradition, of course."
"219317028-0-597";"Dear patron. My reckless approach didn't work out so well. Before I could get in more than a dozen hammer swings on Morella's thugs, she cast some sort of spell and vines snaked out of the ground to bind me. I was held fast. And what did Plucky do? He went over to nuzzle Karamel's outstretched hand. Betrayed again, and by my own dog!"
"219317028-0-598";"Since I'm still writing, I assume you realize I escaped from the clutches of Morella the Cruel. The how of things is what makes the tale interesting. As the vines tightened around me and Karamel stroked Plucky's fur, I saw the Wood Elf smile and wink at me. Morella was delivering a villainous monolog while a dark figure snuck up behind her."
"219317028-0-599";"Guess who rescued me. Go ahead. Guess! I'm sure you'll never figure it out. Shor's bones, I hardly believe it—and I was there! Narsis Dren, the famed explorer who once tried to show me his artifact, slipped into the camp and dispatched Morella the Cruel with a single blow to the head! And then Little-Leaf eliminated her thugs. It was remarkable!"
"219317028-0-600";"I suppose I misjudged Karamel Little-Leaf. And Narsis Dren, as well. They were working together to not only recover the map I had appropriated from the explorer, but to also deal with the threat of Morella the Cruel. The Wood Elf explained it all to me over multiple bottles of mead. And she even had rabbit meatballs for Plucky!"
"219317028-0-601";"Dear patron. While I intend to honor my contract with you, I also agreed to accept Narsis Dren's apprenticeship offer. I'm going to accompany him into the ruins of Bthunzel. I expect my first encounter with Dwarven relics to be extremely illuminating. And getting to spend more time with Little-Leaf … pleases me greatly. An added bonus, I think."
"219317028-0-602";"Hello. Due to the high demands of learning at the feet of the great explorer, Narsis Dren, Valinka Stoneheaver will be unable to send you personalized notes for the foreseeable future. But rest assured your regular shipments will continue. And don't worry. I'm sure you'll hear from her again—or my name isn't Karamel Little-Leaf!"

Luckily I was in the middle of my afternoon cup, and scalding hot herbwater deterred him from his path. I followed up with a sharp blow from my walking stick, and left him insensate in the trees."
"219317028-0-769";"After the unpleasantness of the other day, it was a balm seeing a waterfall today. A few Argonian lads enjoyed it as well, sliding and leaping from its height. Plunging to the pool below, swimming with their tails. Having no tail myself, I can only speculate what that's like ... seems most useful. Unless you're buying a pair of breeches."

"219317028-0-811";"Dearie, hope the provisions today find you well. I've caught a sniffle from a hard rain on the trail, and I'm writing this curled up near my campfire. Have a pot of saltrice brew bubbling on some hot rocks. Not looking forward to what comes next, but I'm a big girl. I can handle it."
"219317028-0-812";"Though the saltrice was quite disgusting, it's done just the trick and I'm back on the trail again. Walking with my head held high and enjoying the sunlight makes me feel half my years. Enjoy your provisions today ... I feel quite proud of their quality."
"219317028-0-813";"Last night in a tavern I met a curious little Wood Elf. He was quite friendly, but had dubious taste in libations. He introduced me to a drink called Rotmeth ... a kind of stew beer full of unidentified meats. It tooks a few sips to get used to. But you know what, dearie? This old lady quite likes it! Mmm."
"219317028-0-814";"The last few days I've been traveling with an adventuring band. It's very pleasant to talk with fellow travelers. Apparently they have plans to go sorting through a small cave nearby, and they've invited me to come along. They say there may be treasures worth finding down there. How exotic!"
"219317028-0-815";"Well that was quite exciting! Dearie, have you ever seen a Goblin? Strange little creatures all dressed in simple cloth, rarely bathed and very cranky. They remind me a bit of Gavonne and his siblings when they were younger, actually."
"219317028-0-816";"I hope these provisions find you well. I managed to collect some of them exploring that cave with my new friends. We stumbled on a cavern full of surprisingly frisky skeletons. Now, I'm no expert, but I thought that dead people ... well, that they lay down."
"219317028-0-817";"Well that was bracing! I write you from a drawn bath, steaming away my aches and bruises from the last few days. I'm not sure I'd attempt such an excursion again any time soon, but my cohorts walked away with a dear treasure. A mask of some kind.  I hope they find success in the great city markets."
"219317028-0-818";"These provisions today were dearly won, and I hope they find you well. I encountered a group of strangely dressed men and women in the woods today. They were muscled and shaggy, and had a strange glint to their eyes. I made excuses and quickly returned to the trail. I do not wish to see them again."
"219317028-0-819";"I must be doing something right, as the broker that handles our contract has given me something of a bonus! I can only assume I'm meeting your needs, and I thank you for any kind words you may have put in his ear. Use today's shipment in good health, and may the Eight watch and keep you."
"219317028-0-820";"I've decided to buy some ink and parchment with my bonus. I've seen some fascinating things in my travels, and I feel others may find my descriptions the same. Who knows? Perhaps someday the Mages Guild may find my scribblings worthy of distribution across Tamriel!"
"219317028-0-821";"You may or may not know this, but we provisioners make contacts as we go. Foraging in the wilds will only get you so far. Procurement in cities and towns along my route is essential to making sure I fulfill our contract. This is a long way of saying, if you meet a provisioner Najkeem, slap him and mention my name. He'll understand why."
"219317028-0-822";"Staring up at the sky this evening, I'd swear some of the stars are missing. It's the strangest thing. I know, as a girl, there were points of light in one part of the sky that don't seem to be there anymore. Must be a trick played by an old woman's brain. Still, something fanciful to ponder as I lay on my bedroll tonight."
"219317028-0-823";"May today's provisions be tomorrow's great meals! As I write to you I find myself wondering what adventures you're up to. Crawling through caves, fighting off fearsome Daedra ... makes me glad I have my quiet little life. I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a swordswoman at my age!"
"219317028-0-824";"I received a letter from Gavonne when I stopped into town today. Sounds like he was on the mend, but ended up in some kind of elaborate scheme with a local cowherd and a traveling minstrel. I'll spare you the tedious details, but it sounds like he's going to be confined to his bed for a time more."
"219317028-0-825";"I'm sorry if this letter finds you tardy, but I've been elbow-deep in a challenging contract of late. Please find your provisions enclosed, and if any of them are smeared in pig fat you have my sincere apologies."
"219317028-0-826";"Dearie, I'm pleased to say I've been taken on as a cook at a large estate. It's a unique opportunity for me, and will allow me to gather higher quality provisions for you in the future. Just today, for example, I was out in the lush gardens behind the main house picking ingredients. A delightful start to the week."
"219317028-0-827";"I never mentioned why I was hired on at the estate, did I? Traveling the other day, I came across a man standing next to a cart with a broken wheel. He was quite upset, because his wife was in the midst of giving birth. I happily lent my hands to the cause, and he was so grateful he hired me on the spot. The Eight smiling down on me!"
"219317028-0-828";"Let it never be said that good fortune is given freely, dearie. I fear my time at the estate is already drawing to a close. The child I helped to bring into this world, it turns out … bears little resemblance to the lord of the manor. His gratitude has turned sour, and I feel I may soon outstay my welcome. The drama of the road, I suppose!"
"219317028-0-829";"Back on the open road, and happy to be here. I feel particularly good about the provisions I have for you today. I gathered them in a beautiful forest with a bubbling spring and prancing deer. They were a challenging hunt. I sit this evening enjoying a fine venison steak ... I've lived well today."
"219317028-0-830";"I treasure the few nights I get to share a campfire with a friendly stranger. Last eve I shared a pot of stew with an Altmer of the Summerset isles, roving the land searching out ancient ruins. As hard as my work can be, at least I know where to look. Imagine trying to find the leftovers of long-gone cities? Amazing."
"219317028-0-831";"My Elven friend has invited me to join him in exploring an Ayleid ruin. He found references to its location, deep in the forests, by following scraps of clues scattered across a dozen tomes. Fascinating! I've never seen what a fortress of the Ancients looked like before!"
"219317028-0-832";"Dearie, the sights I've seen today! Glowing stones, magical columns of light, whole walls that shift at the push of a switch … the Ancients were a magnificent race. If their ruins are used to measure them, at any rate. I even found you a few provisions before we went in. I hope they serve you well."
"219317028-0-833";"Adventures in the dark certainly do work your legs! After exploring through several wings of the lost city, my friend cracked the seal on a long-closed doorway. Within the Ancients had left behind a number of guardians. Magical beasts slaved to protect their ancient libraries. I led the charge back to the surface!"
"219317028-0-834";"I parted ways with my Elven friend this evening. Despite our brush with danger, I quite enjoyed his company. I'm left with some unique memories and detailed charcoal rubbings. I'm very grateful for the parchment and writing implements I have in my knapsack. What a story this will make!"
"219317028-0-835";"I was wading hip-deep into a stream to collect some delicious provisions for you (hope you like them, by the way), when an elemental spirit rose up in front of me. She stared at me for a long moment before snatching the net and fish from my hands and disappearing back into the water. What a world we live in!"
"219317028-0-836";"The procurement agents of Skyrim are an honest and helpful lot. The quality of goods I receive never fails to impress. The only real problem I have is that they insist on a round of drinks after every transaction. In most towns, I speak to a few provisioners in a day. This is a lengthy way of saying that I cannot feel my face. Loves, dearie!"
"219317028-0-837";"It's sometimes hard to see the line between untouched wilderness and the grounds of an estate. Today I learned what it's like when a Jarl's men come out of nowhere and seize you for poaching. I hope this missive finds you, as I'm currently sitting the local village's lockup. Eh ... exciting!"
"219317028-0-838";"Sitting in the holding cell, I overheard the local guardsmen talking about a shocking development. Murder is a blow in any community, but the death of someone in a small town rattles everyone there. With my experience as a tracker, and the keen eye of a provisioner, I offered my assistance."
"219317028-0-839";"I hope these supplies make for delicious meals, dearie. I'm free of my cell, out and about in town. I've spent the last few days talking to the villagers, investigating the death of the local blacksmith. He was stabbed in the back with his own dagger, if you can believe that!"
"219317028-0-840";"As my grandmother used to say, the stew thickens! The blacksmith had been seen making time with several of the local ladies. His wife, of course, did not appreciate that kind of thing. That makes the wife the most likely to have done the deed ... but things are sometimes not what they seem. I will investigate further."
"219317028-0-841";"My instincts were right! Though a number of the women in town had reason to see him dead, the blacksmith was killed over a business dispute. He shorted the local mining company coins year after year, and it finally caught up with him. The provisioner's eye sees the truth once again!"
"219317028-0-842";"My aid to the town guards earned my freedom, and so once again I enjoy the brisk air and crisp cobblestone paths of Skyrim. It's quite interesting how different the grains and fruit of different lands taste. I hope these newly sourced provisions make for fresh and tasty meals!"
"219317028-0-843";"The high country is truly breathtaking, when you stop to take it in. Most people my age think of the wilds as forbidding, suicidal to explore. I've found that with a kind demeanor and a sturdy pair of boots, Tamriel is a very welcoming land."
"219317028-0-844";"In letters from home, my sister is constantly asking why I do this. In her mind, walking paths so far from home must be some kind of punishment. Just the opposite! Today I had the luxury of cooking and brewing with an extended family of jovial Nords. The only challenge was learning when to duck when they began throwing kegs to each other."
"219317028-0-845";"On the road again, and thoughts of supper with the Nords make my stomach rumble. Herbed rabbit sausage in fennel gravy! Frothy golden brews, freshly tapped from massive kegs. Game birds stuffed with wild grains and fruit, roasted over a pit fire. Mmm. Makes my humble onion stew seem paltry in comparison."
"219317028-0-846";"I feel particularly good about this cache of supplies, dearie. May it serve you well. The borders of the Ashlands are highly fertile. One must just be willing to look in unconventional places. The mushroom forests are far more lush than a conventional provisioner might consider."
"219317028-0-847";"Fulfilling your contract is a pleasure, dearie. A daily meditative act that allows me to focus on the more ... esoteric challenges I must face. For example, acquiring netch milk. Milking those floating beasts is enough to make me question my choices in life."
"219317028-0-848";"I spoke with a traveler today who turned out to also be a contractual gatherer! I traded him some honey brittle for a very fine pair of boots, and we talked about the vaguaries of the business. It was nice to speak with another professional. So few really understand the trials we face."
"219317028-0-849";"A torrential rain is sweeping through the region, and I find myself with a few days within the walls of a rather nice inn. Dark Elf architecture is a bit austere for my tastes (more of a thatched roof woman, honestly), but this place is actually rather cozy. I'm using this as an opportunity to begin scribbling on my parchment in earnest."
"219317028-0-850";"I've delved into my stores to provide your provisions. I hope my offerings meet your standards! As the rain dances on the rooftops, I'm pages deep into my first manuscript. So far I've focused my writings on my time as a young woman in the Stormhaven aristocracy. All that drama and intrigue seems so foolish now."
"219317028-0-851";"I've spent some time now thinking back to my time as a foolish little maid dancing in the festhalls of Wayrest. All of those nights blend together, but what I do remember is making for delightful writing. I'm certain Gavonne would be scandalized if he were ever to read this. Luckily for me, my nephew is not much for reading."
"219317028-0-852";"From my time in Wayrest to my time in exile, my scribblings continue. When the family was cast out of the heartland it took quite some time to adjust. The best of everything, the glamorous dresses and expensive foods. It was over a year before I got the hang of making even a simple stew."
"219317028-0-853";"I've cleared out the last of my stores for this shipment, dearie, but fear not! The weather has finally cleared. Meantime I've begun chronicling the family's small steps towards a new life. It fills me with pride to think back on how the family rallied around my father's vision for a wilderness trading coster."
"219317028-0-854";"The Ashlands are in full bloom after the protracted rain, and the smell of life fills the air. Gathering provisions and blooming plants go hand in hand, of course. Expect the next few shipments to be particularly choice!"
"219317028-0-855";"Ahh, nothing quite like clearing your lungs after being cooped up inside. I rather think there's something spiritual about travel. Waking with the dawn knowing you'll be falling asleep under different trees, with different sights fading in the evening light. Makes you feel blessed by the Eight! Or at least, makes me feel that way."
"219317028-0-856";"An old friend is running procurements on the border of Shadowfen, and offered to be my guide. I've known her practically since she was an egg. Such a pleasure to see her all grown up with a full head of feathers. One of the nice things about getting old, dearie. You get to see how people turn out!"
"219317028-0-857";"Talk of the Pact has filled my ears these last few days. My guide is a staunch proponent of the alliance between her people and the Dark Elves. I'm glad she's happy, but the few Dunmer I've seen in the fens don't seem to have gotten the message. They still had that arrogant smirk when they spoke to any Argonian local. Hmph."
"219317028-0-858";"The Argonian people are very proud of their cuisine, and I hope some of their unique culinary taste comes through in today's shipment. It takes some time to adjust, but dishes like crawdad salad or swamp eel pie really are a delight. The only thing I can't recommend is the dish called Wriggles-in-Gullet. Yech."
"219317028-0-859";"I spent the day working a saltrice field, seeing firsthand how this staple is cultivated. The pretty people of the big cities think it a disaster if mud sprays their dress. Meanwhile, the people of this village work most of the day fully bent over, tending to a crop that feeds three provinces. Priorities, dearie."
"219317028-0-860";"I hope my shipment arrives intact and dry, dearie. Much as I care for the people of the fens, the constant ... moistness wears on a person. I've stopped off in a temple complex full of Argonian contemplatives. Their architecture is breathtaking, and their dedication extreme. My plan is to spend a few restful days in the cloister."
"219317028-0-861";"My hopes for quiet days at the temple have been dashed. I was taking a late walk last eve, and stumbled upon a dead monk! I had just leaned down to examine the body when a trio of temple guards came round a corner and saw me there. The monks now consider me a murderer! It's been all I can do to keep their knives from my throat."
"219317028-0-862";"Once again I find myself in the middle of an investigation. This time there are no kindly guards to help me along. I spent the better part of a morning explaining myself to the monks, and I think they believe I am not a threat. I've been given a chance to prove my innocence. I'll just have to make the most of it."
"219317028-0-863";"The dead man was a respected member of the order, it seems. I didn't realize it that evening, but his death appears to be some kind of ritual slaying. If I hadn't been paying attention I probably would have tripped over his displayed body. The slashes, the blood, the sigils ... it's all quite curious."
"219317028-0-864";"My careful observations and pointed questions have led me to one conclusion: Argonian monastics are a secretive bunch. No one claims to know anything about the monk's death ... but my inquiries have made me aware of an ancient menhir near the temple grounds. I believe it merits further investigation."
"219317028-0-865";"A bit of excitement last night, dearie! It turns out the menhir was in use by a foul cult, some of its members infiltrating the temple caretakers. Luckily for your old girl, my time on the road left me up to the challenge of fleeing for my life! The loyalist monks rallied and put down the cult, and everything seems to be forgiven. Thank the Eight!"
"219317028-0-866";"While I'm grateful I could help the monks find justice, I turned my ankle quite badly running from those madmen. My plans to continue through the fens seem folly now, so I'm making for the coast by cart. I'm to board a ship for Elsweyr. I've arranged for provisions to continue through my procurement specialists in the meantime, of course."
"219317028-0-867";"Sailing from a Shadowfen port is always challenging, but my ankle in a brace has made everything all the more complicated. It's for the best, though. I find myself quite wearied by the swamp, and the required rest of a few days at sea will be welcome. This evening we tack south across Topal Bay, then west along the coast."
"219317028-0-868";"I had not even considered time at sea would allow for writing. I've carved out a cozy little nook in the back corner of this cargo hold. Rice sacks for pillows, and my foot propped up to heal. I'm using a hatch cover as a writing desk ... and honestly I couldn't be happier. I find I truly do love time with my scribbles."
"219317028-0-869";"I've taken up the story of my father's trading coster, again. Writing it down, it's strange to think how difficult things were. I did much of what I do now for you. Traveled the back country, finding sources for our new clients ... I learned so much in such a short time. Far more than in all my life as a daughter of Wayrest."
"219317028-0-870";"Putting together this pack of provisions made me think of my first hunt, dearie. And so I set to scribbling again. I think the first time I took down a stag was a watershed moment for me. I'd never had blood on my hands before ... and there I was turning that beast into steaks for our clients."
"219317028-0-871";"My father started the business that saved our lives. Writing about his death ... or the feeding frenzy that followed ... I have no interest. Gavonne's father, as you might have surmised, emerged the one with a controlling interest. It's been years. So long, that when my nephew asked me to fulfill his contract I didn't think twice."
"219317028-0-872";"We've arrived in port, and I'm very grateful to be back on dry land. My time at sea was good for my leg and bad for my head, as walking proves much easier and keeping an upbeat attitude much harder. I'm hoping a return to the road will clear my mood, and allow me to stretch my muscles."
"219317028-0-873";"Apologies if my last few missives have got you down. My family's past is not light reading, and I feel my letters are more welcome when I speak positively. So, know today that I've had a wonderful time on the road. Collecting provisions for you again (hope you enjoy) has cleared my head and restored my cheer."
"219317028-0-874";"The sand dunes and savanahs of Elsweyr are a dramatic change from the Argonian fens. The Khajiit, too, are about as different in spirit as you could hope to see from the lizard-folk. Gregarious, friendly, and traders in deliciously sugary treats ... dearie, I am glad to be here."
"219317028-0-875";"The cities of the Khajiit are so different than those of High Rock. I know my father would have called them camps, but I can see the simple beauty in their design. I spoke to one man who had traveled to my homeland as a trader. He said by contrast, his people see the buildings of my people as cages. Points of view, dearie."
"219317028-0-876";"The cat-men of Elsweyr are a friendly lot, and their procurement agents are no exception. Unlike other cultures that speak broadly about food, the Khajiit sample their wares as they show them off. As part of the conversation, I must as well. If I can manage to stand up tomorrow morning, I shall have some lovely items to send your way."
"219317028-0-877";"Today marks a third day in the company of my Khajiiti procurement hosts. My only context for feasts like this are the new year fetes held at the family manor. You ate well knowing that it was one day out of the year. I now find that the idea of anything richer than trail bread is curdling my stomach. It's a new, not very welcome, sensation!"
"219317028-0-878";"The sampling of sweetmeats, wines, brandies, candies, pheasants, ducks, venison, veal, syrup rolls, honey cakes, cordials, milks, and teas has finally come to a close. I've eaten enough in the last few days to fuel a walk around Nirn! I plan on nibbling broth and bread the next few days, and trying not to think of how much moonsugar I've consumed."
"219317028-0-879";"My friend! Your humble servant Gavin returns! After much searching I have joined my dear aunt on the road. Strange how hard it was to follow in her footsteps. No matter, please enjoy the enclosed supplies!"
"219317028-0-880";"Over my aunt's objections, I did all of our bargaining today in the language of the Khajiit. I could barely understand them, but we still managed to get our business done. It's very sad how poorly these cat-men speak."
"219317028-0-881";"It is wonderous to be on the road again. Such a change of pace. At home we ate weak stew and old bread to save goods for shipping. On the road I eat weak stew and old bread for totally different reasons!"
"219317028-0-882";"Another delivery for you! Enjoy. I'll be honest, Auntie is a stick in the mud. She doesn't understand my jokes, ignores my business advice, and hardly ever wants to start fights. She also drinks far less than I, which seems a mistake."
"219317028-0-883";"My friend, I'm very sorry to say, but I'll need to hand my contract back to Auntie Nonette. We received word from home that my mother is very ill. Alphonse, my good-for-nothing brother, still rots in the king's dungeon. Thus it's up to her favorite son to see her along the path to health. Until next time!"
"219317028-0-884";"I am ... very glad to be alone on the road again. Dearie, I hope you won't think ill of me. But that letter from my sister was a fake. Gavin is a ... very challenging man. In fact, if any of shipments have reached you the last few weeks I will be very surprised. I am a bad aunt, I know this. But he would not. Shut. Up!"
"219317028-0-885";"Alone on the road again, and I'm happy to report a great shipment for you today. My headache has cleared, the twitch in my eye has left, and the nightmares have stopped. When I am not being actively tortured, my proficiency at gathering supplies is much greater!"
"219317028-0-886";"I've reached the edge of the savannah, and Valenwood looms before me. It will be nice to walk in the shade again, and already the variety of supplies is a delightful change of pace. I hope to find a Bosmer village to trade a few unique supplies. I also wouldn't mind some more of that Rotmeth. Meat beer! Who knew?"
"219317028-0-887";"Forest magic stiffens your spine in the morning! I went to sleep in a clearing, on my bedroll and under my travel blanket. Just like I've done hundreds of times since I hit the trail. I awoke to find myself in a large cavern, with some kind of tree-spirit leaning over me. Tree-spirit breath smells like mushrooms. I just thought you should know."
"219317028-0-888";"These supplies were picked in the cavern of a forest guardian, dearie. I hope they serve you well. It turns out the forest spirit smelled moonsugar in my pack and was drawn to me. It couldn't speak, per se, but it communicated through some kind of mind-magic. Who knew that spirit beasts had a sweet tooth?"
"219317028-0-889";"The spirit took me on a journey through the depths of the wood. We saw sights I don't think I can adequately describe, and the pure light of the spirit world has reflected into my soul. The lights told me of the past, the future ... I met my spirit beast, and it looked into my soul."
"219317028-0-890";"Dearie, you must accept my deepest apologies. I checked my stores and it's clear I've been sending you provisions, but do not remember having done so. As best I can tell, the cakes I carried away from the Khajiiti feast were spiced with something stronger than moon sugar. If I said anything strange in my last few missives, I am deeply sorry."
"219317028-0-891";"Now that my head is a bit clearer, I've enjoyed the hospitality of the Wood Elves. Their practice of eschewing plants at the table reminds me of raising Gavin. When he was a child he insisted on meats and nothing else. For me, trips to the outhouse clarify the need for a balanced diet."
"219317028-0-892";"I hope this shipment meets your needs, my friend. I'm making my way to the coast, looking to board a ship north. As far and wide as I've cast my net for you, I feel the need to return a bit closer to home. Hopefully Gavin will forgive me for my little lie on the road. If not, I'm sure I can find a sparkly rock to distract him."
"219317028-0-893";"We've put in at Sentinel for a stopover. The richness of the marketplace will hopefully translate to rich goods for you. I'm struck by how formal many of the Redguard people are. They remind me of my grandmother, actually. Only they have curved swords."
"219317028-0-894";"The architecture of Sentinel is breathtaking! The domes, the curved arches, the rich colors. I wish I had an artist's hand, so that I could translate these graceful buildings to my journal. I'll just have to satisfy myself with fond memories and my sister's incredible jealousy."
"219317028-0-895";"It seems wherever I go, little mysteries follow me! A couple I met selling peppers in the marketplace was very distraught. When I asked them what was wrong, they confessed to me that their young son had gone missing. I've offered my assistance to the couple. We shall see where this leads!"
"219317028-0-896";"Nothing is ever simple, dearie. I asked around the marketplace and the boy just seems to have vanished. We did hear quite a story from one of his friends, that he'd disappeared in a cloud of sand. I'll follow this lead, I suppose, but little boys are about as believable as smitten teenagers when it comes down to it."
"219317028-0-897";"The wonders of Alik'r! I followed the story of the sand cloud to the local Mages guildhall. Apparently there are little zephyrs that run around the dunes, dancing and bouncing like children escaping their mothers. I think one of these little creatures may have tried to make a new friend. We shall see!"
"219317028-0-898";"The boy is home safe, I'm happy to say! A day of walking the outskirts with some candies led the wind creatures right to me. From there I followed them back to the dune hollow they called home. The lad didn't even realize there was a problem! His little friends had been bringing him sweets and tasty roots to nibble. The world we live in."
"219317028-0-899";"I hope this shipment is delicious, my dear. I put special care into my selections, as I am now on a ship heading home. I look forward to more work fulfilling your contract, but for now I need to see my family, hear my sister's nagging voice. Even the obnoxious bleating of my nephews sounds like home right now."
"219317028-0-900";"And here it is, I'm home in beautiful Daggerfall city. I'll make my way to the Gavonne homestead tomorrow, but I wanted to be sure to pack you up a package full of care today. Dearie, my trip for your contract has been a chance of a lifetime. I can't wait to see where it leads me next!"
"219317028-0-901";"I erect the spines of greeting and gratitude for allowing me to provide for some of your outfitting needs. I am Veesk-Olan. You do remember our agreement? You may expect regular deliveries of the best materials and crafting components I can acquire. On that, you have my word."
"219317028-0-902";"The wilds of Deshaan are particularly beautiful this time of the season. I spent much of the day sunning myself beside Lake Hlaalu, watching the torchbugs lazily fly by and otherwise letting the mud of contention slide from my scales. Then I remembered to send this package. Use its contents well!"
"219317028-0-903";"Veesk again. I hope your river still runs clear. As I was preparing this shipment, I suddenly noticed how so many of the materials I send remind me of my own scintillating scales. Kind of makes my stomach twist like a swamp eel in a net. Do not fear, however. I won't shirk my duties just because of a little discomfort."
"219317028-0-904";"Oh, honored employer, a storm brews within me. My egg-brothers once again speak badly of my chosen profession. Well, not my profession, exactly. They say that an Argonian who gets squeamish at the sight of fur and hide has no business trying to earn a living as a clothier. I'm so confused! I feel like a fire apple growing on a stormberry bush."
"219317028-0-905";"Honored employer, thanks again for believing in me and continuing to pay for my timely services. Sorry this shipment is late. I won't let it happen again. But I do have a legitimate excuse. I was as sick as a dehydrated mudcrab after removing the hides of deceased guar in the Narsis lowlands. I'm better now."
"219317028-0-906";"Have you even noticed the eyes of a mudcrab. They stare directly into you. And the intelligence within their unblinking orbs! By the Hist, I may never eat another mudcrab cake again! In fact, I have decided to take this poor, defenseless mudcrab with me. As a companion of sorts. I shall call him--Snips! We will be the best of friends."
"219317028-0-907";"Sometimes I hate my egg-brothers. They laughed long and hard after little Snips took off the tip of my finger with his razor-sharp pincers. I told them he was just playing, and for some reason that made them laugh even harder. I hope their scales dry and turn brittle. Here's your shipment."
"219317028-0-908";"Dear patron, please accept this latest shipment. I had a bad incident when I decided to collect snake skin for leather. First, those dry-skinned Ashlanders in the valley southeast of Mournhold? They take umbrage to people who hunt their precious snakes. Second, the snakes reminded me of my egg-brothers. I cried with each skin I harvested."
"219317028-0-909";"Remember my last letter? How bad I felt as I skinned those valley snakes? Well, I'm over it now. As soon as I returned home, my egg-brothers started making fun of me again. That was all it took for me to come up with a new way to control my aversions. I just remember how cruel they can be and picture them as I peel off the skin. Stay moist!"
"219317028-0-910";"Snips, my mudcrab companion, did the cutest thing. He decided he needed to sharpen his claws, so he started cutting my thick, leather travel bags. He turned my bags into a pile of ribbons so fast! And he kept watching me the whole time, seeking my approval. What a good boy! But I was able to salvage today's shipment. I hope it finds you well."
"219317028-0-911";"Veesk wishes the eggs around me had been empty when I was born! While I was recovering from a bad reaction to collecting hides from dead guars, my egg-brothers hid Snips and pretended that the mudcrab cakes for dinner were made with genuine Snips meat! Even the spines of anger and despair refused to erect when they placed the plate before me."
"219317028-0-912";"How cruel my egg-brothers can be! First, they placed a plate of mudcrab cakes in front of me and told me they were made with jumbo Snips meat. Then, when they saw how devastated I was, they broke down into fits of unrestrained laughter. I paused just long enough to send this shipment, but now I need to confront them and find poor Snips."
"219317028-0-913";"Veesk here. Veesk-Olan. Your hireling. Turns out I didn't need to rescue Snips after all. That brave little mudcrab sliced his way out of the crate they trapped him in. I arrived just in time to see Snips chase my egg-brothers out of the house, snipping at their feet and tails with his remarkably sharp claws. I was so proud!"
"219317028-0-914";"Dear patron, have no fear. I have no intention of shirking my commitment to you. But I have decided to start a new project to help me deal with my aversion to any and all crafting components that remind me of my own body parts. I have decided to become a storyteller! And to demonstrate my ability to build suspense, I'll tell you more. Next time."
"219317028-0-915";"As I wrote last time, I plan to become a storyteller. I've always been fascinated by the tales of the Lusty Argonian and the epic poems of Fjokki the Bard. I have an idea for my own character--the adventures of the Green Hood! Doesn't it sound exciting? An Argonian clothier by day, an avenging hero by night! It practically writes itself!"
"219317028-0-916";"""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" That's the title for my first epic featuring the Argonian hero, the Green Hood. In this story, I introduce the mild-mannered Argonian clothier named Kseev-Nalo, who has a bit of an aversion to dealing with reptilian hides. Reminds him of his own skin. And no, this character is not based on anyone we know."
"219317028-0-917";"Veesk-Olan again, expert hireling and soon-to-be-famous writer. I was telling you about my first story, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" We discover early in the tale that the mild-mannered Argonian with the pet mudcrab has a secret life. At night, he dons a green hood and becomes a hero! My spines tingle in anticipation of my coming fame!"
"219317028-0-918";"Here's another shipment. Now where was I? Oh yes, the origin of my new heroic character, the Green Hood. As a young hatchling in Black Marsh, he was taken in and trained as a Shadowscale. But when he was sent to remove an Argonian elder whose only crime was speaking out against injustice, Kseev-Nalo left the job undone and departed for Mournhold."
"219317028-0-919";"You must be wondering: How did a former Shadowscale become a masked hero who defends Argonians who can't defend themselves? Simple, really. He has the skills and abilities, and he cares about his egg-brothers and sisters. His story is so compelling, even Nords and Dark Elves will look forward to every exciting installment!"
"219317028-0-920";"And did I mention that the Green Hood has a pet mudcrab who helps him fight injustice and tyranny and the forces of Molag Bal? His name is Spins, because he's a whirlwind of heroic destruction! Oh, that's good. I need to jot that in my story journal."
"219317028-0-921";"Writing is hard work. Oh, not these letters included with my shipments. I'm talking about pouring the river of my mind onto the pages of my epic tale, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" After just a few days, I feel like the river has run dry. I need a break. I'll get back to it after the rains of imagination once again overflow my banks."
"219317028-0-922";"Patron, I hope this package finds you well. Here, the deep mud of depression threatens to drown poor Snips. I'm not sure what's wrong, but he hasn't tried to clip a tail or a finger with his claws in days. Worse, he even stopped chasing my nasty egg-brothers around. I hope my mudcrab isn't ill."
"219317028-0-923";"There's been no change in poor Snips. He won't eat. He won't playfully snap at loose extremities. He won't snuggle under my knees when we go to sleep. I'm so worried! After consulting with a number of knowledgeable friends and associates, I've decided to seek the alchemist Aleeto in Eastmarch. I will continue to send you components, of course."
"219317028-0-924";"I feared that poor Snips had contracted Llodos plague, but despite my egg-brothers' protests to the contrary, my mudcrab never turned into a ravenous monster. He remains his usual ball of cuddles and coos, even if he seems to be as sad as a willow tree in a desert. So, we're on our way to Eastmarch to find the alchemist Aleeto."
"219317028-0-925";"Patron, excuse the delay. I disembarked in Windhelm and got caught up in the festive celebration. I thought it was just a normal Nord party, but it turns out that they were honoring the tenth year of King Jorunn's reign. Every time I turned around, someone handed me another mug of mead! It took me three days to extract myself from the joyous city."
"219317028-0-926";"My head is still swirling, like angry storm clouds on a windy day. Who knew Nord mead had such a potent kick? I certainly didn't. I think I prefer the bitter taste of bile-beer to this cloyingly sweet beverage. As soon as my head clears and my teeth stop aching, we're off to find someone to help poor Snips."
"219317028-0-927";"Another day, another shipment. And another bout of nausea, I'm afraid. I can't help picturing my own glistening scales every time I remove the hide of a lizard or a snake. But at least I'm not as ill as poor Snips. My mudcrab companion is one unhappy crustacean. But we have an appointment with the alchemist. Soon everything will be better."
"219317028-0-928";"I hope that the alchemist Aleeto proves to be as good as the tales I've heard about her. She does have an impressive shop in Fort Amol, with walls and a ceiling and everything. It's not just an outdoor stall as so many of the lesser alchemists I've met utilize. I hope she can help Snips. He seems to have gotten even worse since last I wrote you."
"219317028-0-929";"Hello. It's Veesk again. I erect the spine of disappointment in your general direction. The alchemist Aleeto refused to see us. She claimed to have no time to deal with a mudcrab and the crustacean following him around. Now what should I do? I'm not sure Snips can last much longer in this sorry state."
"219317028-0-930";"Patron, I realize I have been remiss in describing what's wrong with Snips. And I want to be a writer! Let me rectify. He has been quiet and nonresponsive, and not at all his usual playful self. More recently, he has begun to swell up like an over-full water skin. I fear he's going to explode! If only the alchemist had agreed to help us."
"219317028-0-931";"What a silly scuttle-claw I am! Turns out, there was nothing wrong with Snips. He was just molting! Now he has a nice, new shell and he's so much bigger than he was before. And I've got his old, discarded shell to save as a keepsake. Sorry to have worried you. Enjoy the shipment."
"219317028-0-932";"I was using the clothier workbench in Fort Amol when the alchemist Aleeto happened by. She noticed how much distress I was in, as I was working with fresh snake skin and guar hides. I can't help it, but all I can think of is myself—flayed alive and scaleless for all the world to see—whenever I work with these components. Aleeto frowned and said …."
"219317028-0-933";"""I think I can help you, after all,"" Aleeto said.  ""Come by my shop after dusk and I might just have something to take care of your queasy constitution."" I must admit, what with all the smoke and explosions usually emanating from her shop, I have some trepidations. But here are more components for your use. Hopefully, more will follow tomorrow."
"219317028-0-934";"I entered Aleeto's shop cautiously. Snips, however, scuttled in and started exploring with his usual playfulness. ""Did your creature wipe his claws?"" Aleeto asked. ""I don't want mud all over my nice, clean floors."" Snips clacked his pincers and cheerfully ignored her. I, however, was feeling neither cheer nor curiosity. I was dry with fright."
"219317028-0-935";"Veesk again. Turns out, I was worried about nothing. Alchemist Aleeto might be a bit rough and a little crazy, but she knows how to mix elixirs and concoctions. Now, her soothing stomach potion smelled like Nord socks and tasted like guar dung before she added a few drops of jute root, but it settled my insides. And she's teaching me to make it!"
"219317028-0-936";"Our visit to Fort Amol was a success. Snips is back to his old self—now significantly larger. I learned how to make a potion to ease my work-related nausea. And I found out that Aleeto is also a storyteller! Her tales are wildly improbable, but she's given me excellent advice on how to proceed with ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."""
"219317028-0-937";"The petals of good fortune have opened in my direction! Aleeto introduced me to her publisher, a Dark Elf from Mournhold who provides exciting tales of adventure and is always looking for the next Narsis Dren. He loves the idea of a masked Argonian and offered to publish my first story! Oh, I wallow in the mud of elation!"
"219317028-0-938";"Patron, Veesk-Olan here. I want to assure you that my newfound calling as a storyteller will in no way diminish my obligation to you. Your shipments will continue to arrive on a regular basis. And I will let you read the tales of the Green Hood before the general public--for only a slight increase in our current agreement."
"219317028-0-939";"""Emerging from the mist like an avenging Aedra, the Green Hood struck with the precision of a lightning strike and the force of a thunder clap. The Dres slavers fell, like young trees in a strong wind."" Oh, patron, the water of imagination overflows my banks! You can soon read the finished manuscript. Meanwhile, use these components well."
"219317028-0-940";"Potential patron, forgive the intrusion. I am Uraviin Dres, of House Dres. I know you have an agreement with Veesk-Olan, but I have the connections and experience to provide a higher level of service than that smelly lizard could ever hope to match. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your affirmation of a new working arrangement."
"219317028-0-941";"Potential patron, perhaps my previous letter failed to reach you. I am Uraviin Dres, of House Dres. You really must sign on with my service, for House Dres offers an ongoing stream of components for all of your crafting needs. Besides, how can you stand touching material that were handled by that ... that ... lizard? I await your reply."
"219317028-0-942";"Honored employer, please disregard any letters you may have received from that Dark Elf dryskin, Uraviin Dres. I discovered that she had taken my journal and was trying to steal my patrons with her false promises and fancy words. Do not believe her! She is evil! And she is part of House Dres. Even Snips is afraid of her!"
"219317028-0-943";"Honored patron, this is Veesk again. Please don't end our employment agreement. I really need the work. Your shipment is included."
"219317028-0-944";"No-longer-potential patron, you are dead to me. I don't understand how you could prefer that disgusting lizard over a scion of House Dres, but you will feel the sting of this rejection. House Dres neither forgives nor forgets. Remember that. I remain Uraviin Dres, of House Dres, and you will regret this unwise decision."
"219317028-0-945";"Veesk here. I recovered my journal and sent that vile Uraviin Dres on her way. She certainly made my scales tingle with the fear of a hundred nights! At least I have inspiration for the villain of my epic tale, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" Although writing about her is sure to give me nightmares. Your shipment is included."
"219317028-0-946";"Oh, patron, I have terrible news! While we were visiting Jorunn's Stand, Snips wandered off to explore, as he often does. This time, however, he wandered too close to the cooking fire of Makes-Many-Soups. She has imprisoned poor Snips in a basket and refuses to return him to me. She does assure me, however, that he will taste delicious."
"219317028-0-947";"They call the chef at Jorunn's Stand Makes-Many-Soups. Luckily, she has just one pot to cook in. She can't make a new soup until the pot is emptied. As I consider how to keep Snips from becoming tomorrow's dinner, I'm spreading tales of how diners have gotten ill eating Makes' current soup. That should keep the pot full until an idea strikes me."
"219317028-0-948";"Never disparage a cook or her food--especially when that cook is an angry Argonian with a heavy ladle! She gave me a bump on my head that looks like the peak of Dragonstar Mountain! Makes-Many-Soups still refuses to return Snips to me, however, and the mud of my options has dried into the dust of indecision. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"219317028-0-949";"After another long discussion with Makes-Many-Soups, I got her to reveal that she has a secret passion for steamy tales of romance and adventure. She has a particular fondness for the stories of the Lusty Argonian, it turns out. Perhaps I can use her obsession to save poor Snips. Your shipment is included."
"219317028-0-950";"What a frustrating woman that Makes-Many-Soups is! You don't know what I had to promise her to secure Snips' freedom. Still, anything to keep my mudcrab companion out of the soup pot, right? I will include her as the sexy heroine in ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers,"" Makes-Much-Love. (She suggested the name.) And I have to take her to dinner."
"219317028-0-951";"Snips is free! And Makes-Many-Soups received a few days leave from her post at the cook pot, so I agreed to accompany her back to Windhelm for the meal I promised to buy her. The trip was uneventful, but we did get a chance to talk along the way. I never knew how fascinating the life of a chef could be. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-952";"Dear patron, my meal with Makes-Many-Soups was surprisingly pleasant. We decided to partake of the fare at the Sober Nord, and the food was delicious. Makes was impressed--and when it comes to food, she's very hard to please. The innkeep even served six-ooze parfait, an Argonian delicacy, to end the meal. It was amazing!"
"219317028-0-953";"Not much to report today. Makes and I took a room at the inn and we're just … working out some scenes for my epic tale of romantic adventure, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" Your components are included."
"219317028-0-954";"I erect the spines of happiness and contentment in your general direction, good patron! What a night we shared! And a day. And another night. But now, alas, we must go our separate ways. Makes must return to her post at the cook pot, and I have materials to collect. I am joyful and sorrowful at the same time."
"219317028-0-955";"Before we parted ways, I shared an idea with Makes-Many-Soups to make her cooking fire better. I suggested she add a second or even a third pot. That way, she can prepare more than one soup at a time and give her patrons a choice. ""More than one soup at a time?"" Makes said, stroking my head fin. ""I must consider this radical approach carefully."""
"219317028-0-956";"By the Hist, I'm so depressed! Who would have thought I'd miss Makes-Many-Soups so much after we parted ways in Windhelm. This must be what that condition Fjokki the Bard always writes about--a broken heart. Anyway, here's your shipment."
"219317028-0-957";"Dear patron. Forgive my previous message. There's no reason to burden you with my heartache and sorrow. It's unprofessional. But in case you were worried about me, please don't. Snips has been remarkably good company and I hardly miss Makes-Many-Soups at all now."
"219317028-0-958";"""She stared into the Green Hood's stormy eyes, an impudent smile playing across her scaly lips. 'Yes, hero, I am that good,' Makes-Much-Love declared. 'Now get out there and stop those Dark Elf slavers!"" As always, good patron, any suggestions you have to improve my rousing epic would be much appreciated. And your materials are included."
"219317028-0-959";"Dishonored enemy, I hope you aren't well. That fool Veesk was so absorbed in his writing that he never noticed as I slipped his work journal from his pack. His vicious mudcrab did attempt to slice a few of my fingers off, but Uraviin Dres is nothing if she isn't faster than a bloated crustacean. So I write to let you know--vengeance is mine!"
"219317028-0-960";"Dishonored enemy. Those bandits who recently attacked you? They belonged to me. That's right, you were ambushed! And that's only the beginning! House Dres believes that revenge is a dish best served with a pinch of pepper and a flask of flin. Lots and lots of flin. Bwahaha! Your components are enclosed, though. Use them poorly!"
"219317028-0-961";"Dear patron, forgive the intrusion. It seems that the scaleless Dark Elf known as Uraviin Dres has once again gotten into my journal and sent disturbing letters to my clients. I erect the spine of apology and beg for your understanding. I promise that such an outrage shall not happen again. Stay moist, my patron!"
"219317028-0-962";"My egg-brothers have come to visit. I'm hoping that they behave themselves, but I expect them to be as annoying and bothersome as ever. They continue to tease me about my chosen profession (clothier materials provider) and about my faithful companion (Snips the marvelous mudcrab). Worse, they found the manuscript for ""The Green Hood."" I'm doomed."
"219317028-0-963";"To my surprise, my egg-brothers aren't teasing me about my work-in-progress, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" Instead, they demand that I complete the story so they can find out what happens. They've never been this interested in my work before. I erect the spine of confusion."
"219317028-0-964";"Could it be true? Did I actually create something that my wretched egg-brothers care about? I'm not sure how to feel about that. Is the Green Hood merely a hero for the common folk or is he an icon of modern Argonian literature? Could he be both? My mind swirls with the fallen leaves of indecision! But never fear. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-965";"My egg-brothers devour every page I write, eager to see what the Green Hood and his paramour, Makes-Much-Love, do next. At this point in the tale, Makes has been taken captive by the slavers, while the evil Duvariin Dres has sent her necromantic creations to destroy the Hood—and all of Mournhold in the process! And that's as far as I've gotten …."
"219317028-0-966";"Oh, bother. The turbulent waters of utter confusion fill my head these days. My egg-brothers want the rest of my epic tale of the Green Hood, but I haven't written it yet. My demanding clients (but not you, of course) want more crafting components. And there aren't enough moments in the day to accomplish both tasks. What is a poor Argonian to do?"
"219317028-0-967";"My river runs exceeding slow this day, patron. I wrote well into the darkest hours, burning my candle from both ends, in order to place a few more pages of story before my eager egg-brothers. Then I was up at the crack of daybreak to gather this batch of components for you. Use them well, you slave driver."
"219317028-0-968";"Readers are never satisfied! They demand more and more and then even more! I feel trapped, like a rabbit in a snare, a victim of my own creativity. Oh, the irony of it all! I hoped for fame, found it, and now pray to the Hist that it fades away as quickly as it arrived. Oh, cruel fate! Your components are included."
"219317028-0-969";"I have an idea, patron. As I furiously near the end of my epic tale, ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers,"" I have decided that the Green Hood will sacrifice his own life to save his paramour, Makes-Much-Love. It will be a heroic end, full of drama and emotion. And it will allow me to cleanly step away from this monster I have created."
"219317028-0-970";"""'Don't weep for me, Makes,' the Green Hood said as the bridge began to collapse. 'I did this to save Mournhold. And to save you, my love.' Then the bridge fell away, carrying the Green Hood into the churning waters and away from Makes' out-stretched hand. He was gone, but the Dres slavers were defeated. Mournhold would survive. The end."""
"219317028-0-971";"Now that my epic tale of the Green Hood has been completed and the book will soon be published, I feel an odd sense of emptiness. Whatever shall I do with my free time now that my writing is finished? At least my egg-brothers enjoyed the story. They did give me a sound beating for killing their hero, so I know they really liked it."
"219317028-0-972";"I have decided to rededicate myself to my chosen profession and double my efforts to gather crafting components for all of my patrons. And since you are my favorite, dear patron, you will benefit most from my newfound commitment. As the sun rises every morning, so shall my shipments to you arrive in a safe and timely fashion."
"219317028-0-973";"Snips did the cutest thing today. His claws are so much sharper than even my finest pair of shears. He watched as I cut strips of cloth from a bolt, then mimicked my actions. Between the two of us, the bolt had been cut into sections in record time. Of course, teaching him to measure before he cuts continues to be a challenge."
"219317028-0-974";"Pardon the interruption. This is Uraviin Dres, of House Dres. I have again borrowed the lizard's journal so that I can reach out to his patrons. I have just one question. How can you continue to employ a hireling who has slandered the good name of House Dres with his book full of hateful lies and half-truths? I am beside myself with indignation!"
"219317028-0-975";"Consider yourself blessed to receive yet another letter from the quill of Uraviin Dres. Have you read that lizard's propaganda called the Green Hood? Utter kwama spittle! No lizard could be so heroic! And how he portrayed House Dres? It's a travesty! A crime against the Three! And his so-called villain? How dare he model her after me!"
"219317028-0-976";"There is only one course opened before me, Uraviin Dres, of House Dres. I must write a rebuttal against the cowardly lizard. Disparage his book far and wide so that no one deigns to read it. Make Veesk a laughing stock throughout the lands of Morrowind and beyond! Oh yes, your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-977";"A hundred pardons, honored patron. That tree mold by the name of Uraviin once again absconded with my client journal. I hope whatever messages she sent weren't too disturbing. I wish she would find her own clients and leave me and mine in peace. As a thank you for your continued support, use these components well."
"219317028-0-978";"Once again I am visiting the great city of Windhelm in my quest to source the finest crafting components for your use. To save some gold, this time I'm staying at the less-expensive accommodations, the Cold-Moon Inn. It seems that my tale of the Green Hood has reached this Nord settlement and I find myself with more attention than I am used to."
"219317028-0-979";"One of the Cold-Moon daughters, Innbild, is very friendly. She serves me before any other customers. She finds time to sit with me and ask all kinds of questions. She's about halfway through ""The Green Hood and the Dres Slavers."" She genuinely seems to be enjoying it. But I wonder why she insists on sitting so close whenever we visit?"
"219317028-0-980";"I think that Innbild has a fascination with Argonians. I heard she was very close to a stable hand named Dazzling-Tail before I arrived, and now she's spending time with me. I thought I understood the mating rituals of the dryskins, but the things Innbild has suggested have confused me. I wonder if her sister Innsold can explain them to me?"
"219317028-0-981";"Dryskins are so confusing. Or maybe it's just Nords. All I did was ask Innsold a question about Nord mating rituals. So that I could better respond to her sister Innbild's advances, you understand. All I learned was that such questions make Nord women extremely angry. And now my jaw hurts from where she slugged me. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-982";"Dear patron. While Innsold may be angry with me, she has shown a remarkable fondness for my mudcrab companion, Snips. I believe that Snips shares her affection, because he hasn't tried to lovingly slice off even one of her long, pale, Nord fingers."
"219317028-0-983";"The stink of a fetid peat bog has floated into Windhelm and her name is Uraviin Dres! If I didn't know better, I'd swear she was following me. Perhaps, like me, it is simply business that brings her to this bustling city. However, I fear she has more dastardly plans than merely filling her house coffers.  A new shipment is enclosed."
"219317028-0-984";"That hagraven Uraviin Dres must have tampered with my store of soothing stomach potions. Instead of settling my queasiness while I work, the potion I imbibed made me more ill. I'm as sick as a guar that got into the bile-beer. I will endeavor to persevere, but I really don't feel very good. Still, your shipment is included."
"219317028-0-985";"My stomach churns like a summer storm. It rumbles like an erupting volcano, making me weak as a newborn pup. Innbild came by. Instead of helping, she yelled at me. ""How could you kill the Green Hood!"" she screamed, ""I love him so much!"" Then she stamped off. I hope she returns soon with some soothing mint tea."
"219317028-0-986";"No soothing mint tea for Veesk today. And Innbild never returned. But I was visited by Uraviin Dres. At least I think it was her. Unless it was a fever dream. She came by to gloat, tell me that she had poisoned me. If I wanted to cure, I had to agree to renounce my book. Or pounce on the crook? My mind swims like a drunken eel."
"219317028-0-987";"The next thing I remembered was Snip. He crawled onto my chest and had a long talk with me. For a mudcrab, he's really quite articulate. Sounds just like a Breton noble. Not sure why I never noticed that before. He also has a lovely singing voice. Sang me an old Black Marsh lullaby and put me right to sleep."
"219317028-0-988";"Bad baby skeevers crawling up my arms! Cheese! The cheese smells like purple and tastes like sun! But never fear. Your shipment said it missed you and wanted to be delivered. The components are attached. Torchbugs!"
"219317028-0-989";"There's nothing left inside me and wisps of colored light dance before my eyes. I think I know how the Green Hood felt as the bridge slowly disintegrated beneath his feet …."
"219317028-0-990";"Honored patron, I feel much better! Please excuse any reports that sounded strange, as whatever vile concoction Uraviin slipped into my soothing stomach potion set off a series of rather vivid hallucinations. I'm not sure how close I came to rejoining the Hist, but I'm almost certain things would have been worse if not for Innsold's intervention."
"219317028-0-991";"I'm not sure what Innsold gave me to drink, but I feel almost like my old self again. She stayed with me throughout the dark time, as my mind swam in and out of focus and my sweat turned from hot to cold and back again. When I finally opened my eyes and actually saw her, she smiled and told me never to scare her like that again."
"219317028-0-992";"Today I witnessed the power of a Nord maiden defending a friend. Innsold Cold-Moon first threatened to rip every hair from her sister's head if she didn't stop complaining about how I ended my story. Then she picked up Uraviin Dres and hurled her bodily into an empty stable stall. Well, it was mostly empty. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-993";"When I asked Innsold why she was helping me since it was only a few days ago that she had slugged me in the jaw, she told me to shut up. Then she kissed me and asked if I wanted to learn how to perform a Nord mating ritual. Or seven. I must admit, for a large, scaleless Nord woman without a tail or a visible egg sac, she had me intrigued"
"219317028-0-994";"Dear patron, you don't know how hard it was for me to say goodbye and leave Windhelm. I'm going to miss Innsold Cold-Moon. She advanced my understanding of Nord practices by leaps and bounds--literally! I'm even going to miss her sister, who broke down and hugged me when I told her I had a way to bring the Green Hood back to life."
"219317028-0-995";"Ah, patron, I enjoyed our time together as the swamp beetle enjoys the sun on its shell. But soon Snips and I must move on to other things. You see, the visions I suffered from Uraviin's poison weren't all bad. From them, I came up with a way to return the Green Hood from the land of the dead. And the adventure, as they say, is going to be epic!"
"219317028-0-996";"To make my transition from novice storyteller to full-time writer, I need to find someone worthy to take over my component-sourcing business. I have a particular person in mind, someone who you may not completely trust. But rest assured, not every fetid fruit is rotten on both sides. Your components are included."
"219317028-0-997";"I caught up to Uraviin on the road to Fort Amol. Ostensibly, I was on my way to visit my friend, Makes-Many-Soups, but I was actually seeking the scion of House Dres. We cautiously greeted each other, wary of treachery on both our parts. But to forestall any trouble, I erected the spine of apology and offered to make amends for my story."
"219317028-0-998";"We talked for hours around her campfire. I explained my ideas for the further adventures of the Green Hood and how he would find an ally in a daughter of House Dres, demonstrating that not every Dark Elf is a villain. So that I had the time to write all these adventures, I told her I needed someone to service the clients in my component business."
"219317028-0-999";"Exciting news. I am now a full-time teller of epic stories! I'll remain active in the component-sourcing business, but my new partner will handle the day-to-day gathering and distribution to clients. Allow me to introduce Uraviin Dres, clothier crafting hireling supreme! Please afford her the same respect you always gave to me. And wish me luck!"
"219317028-0-1000";"Patron. Now that you have entered into a partnership with Uraviin Dres, there will be a few changes. First, I will be unable to send you personalized notes for the foreseeable future. That's just not my cup of flin. Second, your regular shipments will continue. Third, I will avenge myself against Veesk. After all, I am a scion of House Dres."
"219317028-0-1001";"I understand you're in the market for a hireling. Someone to acquire components for you. Materials. Of the woodworking variety. Then look no further! I'm Margog the Hammer, and I'm just the Orc for the job. My rates are cheap, my deliveries are on time, and I know Orcs who know Orcs, if you understand my intention."
"219317028-0-1002";"Margog the Hammer here, sending greetings and salutations. I'm proud to say that my business has really taken off. As you can plainly see, the quality of my merchandise is of the highest caliber. It all has to do with my suppliers. I've made arrangements to provide the best materials to you on a regular basis. Arrangements that can't be refused."
"219317028-0-1003";"This latest shipment didn't fall off the back of a merchant wagon--at least not all of it! But I jest. You'll discover as we get to know each other that Margog the Hammer has a wonderful sense of humor. I'm even funnier than most Orcs, or so I've been led to believe. All of my henchmen say so. Of course, that's what I pay them for! Ha!"
"219317028-0-1004";"I have a confession to make. I'm not supplying you with crafting components out of any sense of duty or obligation. I have an ulterior motive. I'm using the profits to finance my grander ambitions. You see, I plan to build an organization that has its fingers in all kinds of related businesses. I guess you could call me an entrepreneur."
"219317028-0-1005";"Some of my business ventures might be considered criminal. I'm all right with that. I supply the necessary services to meet the ever-growing demands, and if that's a crime then I'm a skinny Wood Elf! But never fear, boss. For you, everything will always be above board and totally honest. For the most part. And you have my word on that!"
"219317028-0-1006";"Greetings, boss. It's me, Margog the Hammer. Since you seem interested in my various enterprises, I thought I'd tell you about my latest venture. I'm in the middle of establishing a method for redistributing appropriated goods in the town I call home. Turns out, someone already thinks they have that business locked up--and they're angry with me."
"219317028-0-1007";"Do I care about a filthy Khajiit? Do I care about his claim to have cornered the market on the redistribution of goods acquired by questionable means in my town? Of course not! Who does Splendid-Paws think he is? He's not my boss! He's not even an Orc! If he sends his thugs around here again, I can't be held responsible for what happens."
"219317028-0-1008";"An unfortunate accident befell Splendid-Paws' associates today. They demanded their share of gold from my business. A business they had nothing to do with. That's when the hammer hanging over my work table slipped from its hook and bashed both of the poor fellows in the head. Repeatedly. I hope the Khajiit has a good healer on his payroll."
"219317028-0-1009";"Hello, boss. I hope this shipment of woodcrafting components finds you well. At least, I hope you're feeling better than those thugs the so-called Khajiit crime lord sent to talk to me. I understand one of them may not make it. I imagine this could lead to further trouble between the cat and I, but such is the cost of doing business. Am I right?"
"219317028-0-1010";"With all of my other business ventures going so well, you're probably wondering why I continue to serve as a hireling for crafting components. That's a fair question. Woodworking calms me. It lets me clear my head and relax. Call it a hobby. I figure I might as well make some gold in the process, so here we are. Your materials are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1011";"Well, boss, as I was telling you last time, woodworking calms me. As you know, I'm an Orc, and I have an Orc's temper. Maybe even two Orcs' worth! My other businesses often require me to give my temper free rein. So at the end of the day I need to do something that relaxes me and lets the tension slide away. Sawing and hammering works wonders!"
"219317028-0-1012";"I had a visit from thugs working for the Khajiit known as Splendid-Paws. I decided to open a tavern across from his inn, and that has his fur standing on end. Doesn't he know that competition is good for the digestion? And I'm building the place with my own two hands. Consider it a massive woodworking project to help me deal with my anger issues!"
"219317028-0-1013";"Greetings, boss. Margog here. Another unfortunate accident sent Splendid-Paw's employees to the healer again. That's what happens when you wander into a construction site without paying attention to where you're walking. You fall into a pile of wooden beams and iron nails. Over and over again. Maybe now the Khajiit will mind his own business."
"219317028-0-1014";"My tavern should be ready for its grand opening very soon. I'm going to call the place ""Hammer and Saw"" because woodworking means so much to me. I'm one busy Orc! Crafting supplier, tavern owner, dealer in dubiously acquired goods, conveyer of illicit materials—like I said, an entrepreneur! Speaking of which, your materials are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1015";"While we'd never have cause to be disagreeable to one another, my other business ventures often require me to let my inner Orc out to play. I'm not proud of my violent tendencies, but they do help me keep the gold flowing. Sometimes you have to break a few legs to make a kwama egg omelet, am I right? At least, that's how my uncle explained it."
"219317028-0-1016";"Hello, boss. If I don't sound like my usually cheerful self, that's because I'm upset. I've always felt a little bad after a client or a rival requires me to accidentally injure them repeatedly in the course of a transaction. It's the cost of doing business. But today's transaction has left me feeling out of sorts. Regretful, even."
"219317028-0-1017";"You're probably wondering what could have happened to make old Margog the Hammer into a melancholy horker. Where's the happy-go-lucky Orc with a million ideas that I hired, you're probably asking yourself. Well, he feels bad about something that happened the other day. And instead of evaporating like so much dew, that feeling remains. Guilt."
"219317028-0-1018";"So what did Margog do to feel guilty about? I injured one of my rival's associates! That's right. Splendid-Paws got his fur in a bunch over something or another I did and sent a couple of thugs to teach me a lesson. That never works out well for either Splendid-Paws or his thugs, as you well know. But one of those thugs was Fahdah the Eyeful."
"219317028-0-1019";"Fahdah the Eyeful. She's a Redguard brawler whose brawn is matched by her stunning beauty. I've had the opportunity to watch her work as an interested bystander and her beatings are legendary. She accomplishes more with a look and a snarl, however, than most thugs can even get close to with a barrel full of weapons. I hope the healer can help her!"
"219317028-0-1020";"I admit it. I, Margog the Hammer, busted up Fahdah the Eyeful. I think I broke her arm! And I feel terrible about it! Of course, she and her associate had come into my not-quite-ready-for-business tavern with the express purpose of delivering a message of pain and suffering to me from their boss, Splendid-Paws. But it was Fahdah! What should I do?"
"219317028-0-1021";"Now, boss, in case you think I'm getting soft, let me educate you on the facts. I'm Margog the Hammer! I'm an entrepreneur who enjoys woodworking and sometimes has to put on a tough facade with my various business associates. But I never provide a beating to someone who doesn't deserve it. Fahdah certainly deserved it. So why am I so unhappy?"
"219317028-0-1022";"After talking to the healer, I've determined that Fahdah the Eyeful is going to be all right. Turns out, her arm isn't broken. It's just a bad bruise. She'll be back on her feet and breaking skulls in no time. I'll probably have to watch my back for a while, but at least I'll get to see her around a little more often. Your materials are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1023";"The Hammer and Saw opened its doors today. What a grand turn out we had! The place was packed, the drinks were flowing, and the crowd was happy and excited. It was everything I hoped for. If you ever visit Forlorn, feel free to drop by. Your first ale is on the house! And I'd love to get your opinion on the woodwork."
"219317028-0-1024";"What a strange turn of events. The Khajiit crime lord, Splendid-Paws, decided to pay a visit to my humble little tavern. He rarely leaves the comfort and safety of his inn, but he walked in like he owned the place, surrounded by an entourage of toughs--including Fahdah the Eyeful. He had a drink and toasted to my success. So why do I feel worried?"
"219317028-0-1025";"Have I told you much about the town of Forlorn? It's a small but growing community in the wilds of High Rock. We have an inn, a tavern, a stable, and the usual mix of merchants and crafters. We even have a healer, but she mostly caters to Splendid-Paws and his thugs. We don't have a temple, but traveling priests pass through from time to time."
"219317028-0-1026";"A traveling priest of Mara wandered into town today. I'm not a religious Orc. I barely acknowledge Mauloch. But I'm still dealing with these conflicted emotions concerning my businesses and the necessities of violence when the priest entered my tavern. We got to talking and she actually has me contemplating a more peaceful approach to life."
"219317028-0-1027";"Can Margog the Hammer become Margog the Serene? That's what the priest of Mara says is my best hope for a happy existence. She wants me to ignore my violent impulses. She says I should stop using rude and obscene language. That I should look for the beauty in all things and endeavor to be more friendly. This might just kill me, but I'll try."
"219317028-0-1028";"Greetings, boss. Here's another shipment of crafting materials. I'm trying real hard to maintain a calm, serene exterior, even though everyone around me is as annoying as a room full of skinny Wood Elves. It's taking all of my considerable willpower not to reach for one of my hammers every time someone opens their mouth. But you have a good day."
"219317028-0-1029";"That damn cat and rival crime lord Splendid-Paws! He decided to interfere with my business operations again. This time, he's hired brigands to intercept my shipments of illicit materials. You know, my smuggling endeavors? Oh, pardon my bluntness, but maintaining this serene exterior is starting to wear on my nerves! I really need to hit something!"
"219317028-0-1030";"It's me, Margog the Hammer. I've lost two shipments of smuggled goods in as many days because of those brigands working for Splendid-Paws the Khajiit crime lord. Well, enough is enough! I'm taking a few of my employees and we're going to find these brigands. And when we do, I'm going to serenely and calmly beat them to bloody pulps!"
"219317028-0-1031";"Excuse the terseness, but can't write much. We're on the trail of Splendid-Paws' brigands. Here are your crafting components. I'm feeling better than I have in days. More later. Margog the Hammer."
"219317028-0-1032";"Hello, boss. Margog the Hammer here. I thought you'd like to know that I recovered my stolen goods from the brigands that stole them from me. And I dealt with the brigands. Just like hammering a few nails. The roads around Forlorn should be safer. At least for a while. I guess that serenity, like all things, needs to be practiced in moderation."
"219317028-0-1033";"I returned to discover that we had a new arrival in town. Someone in their infinite wisdom decided we needed some sort of law in our burgeoning community. So now I have to figure out how to deal with Constable Chedric Celd and his pledge to bring order to the wilds of High Rock. I can't tell you how safe and secure I feel now. Really. I can't."
"219317028-0-1034";"Splendid-Paws. Fahdah the Eyeful. Uncooperative merchants. I know how to deal with these things. Constable Chedric Celd? Not so much. He's so full of righteous indignation, stern honor, and unflappable honesty. In fact, he's so incorruptible it makes me want to gag! He refused my bribe and said he'd be watching me. How annoying!"
"219317028-0-1035";"The brave and honorable Constable Chedric, how I detest the man! I should have let Splendid-Paws make the first move, but I had to try to buy his loyalty. I still have my gold, but now the good constable is aware of my possible affiliation with the less-than-honest aspects of society. It's enough to make me consider that crime really doesn't pay."
"219317028-0-1036";"Here you go, another shipment of crafting components. Pardon my tone, but the new constable has crawled up my business and put me in the foulest of moods. If I don't get him to turn his attention in another direction soon, I'm going to lose out on a lot of gold. I might have to arrange for an accident to happen, but you didn't hear that from me."
"219317028-0-1037";"Hello, boss. Margog the Hammer here. I'm in a better mood today. It appears that the good Constable Chedric finally noticed that Splendid-Paws refers to himself as ""the crime lord of Forlorn!"" While he was merely suspicious of me, he's now actively investigating the Khajiit's business dealings. Let's hope he finds something vile and incriminating."
"219317028-0-1038";"One of the suppliers I deal with, a Dark Elf named Beranzen, decided he wanted to expand his options by eliminating the middle man. Unfortunately, that would mean leaving me out of the business altogether.  That, as I'm sure you can understand, isn't what I'd call an acceptable situation. I think we need to have a talk. I'll bring my hammer."
"219317028-0-1039";"The Dark Elf Beranzen, let's call him a collector of lost goods. He always came to me to turn his illicit items into gold. Gold for him. Gold for me. I heard that the thief wants to start shopping for the best deal. He wants to take advantage of the free market, I guess. We're going to have a discussion. After I ship your materials."
"219317028-0-1040";"Sad news, boss. Beranzen and I couldn't come to an equitable agreement. I'm truly sorry that we won't be doing business going forward. And that I had to drop him into the town's pig pen after he accidentally tripped and hit his head on my hammer. Twice. It's unfortunate, but things happen when people try to take advantage of my generous nature."
"219317028-0-1041";"Margog the Hammer, at your service! May these components find you happy and rolling in gold! You may be curious about my cheerful disposition. It's all because good Constable Chedric brought the sword of justice down on Splendid-Paws' illegal operation. That has me feeling ecstatic! Now if you'll excuse me, I have some celebrating to do."
"219317028-0-1042";"That happy moment was short lived. Talk about unfortunate circumstances! All of the witnesses that Constable Chedric had rounded up to speak against the Khajiit crime lord have mysteriously vanished. Oh, there were the usual notes about being called away unexpectedly, but if you ask me, they're swimming with the mudcrabs at the bottom of the lake."
"219317028-0-1043";"My nemesis (I have a nemesis!) Splendid-Paws is free and clear--at least for the moment. But Constable Chedric isn't happy about the turn of events any more than I am. He let us both know it in no uncertain terms. And he warned that he'd be watching us. Both of us. Oh joy! Maybe I have two nemeses. I'll need to think about that. Materials enclosed."
"219317028-0-1044";"Hello, boss. Let me tell you about a new project I've started to help calm my nerves and bring me to a state of serenity. I'm building an elaborate house for the bantam guar that congregate behind my tavern. Have you seen one of those creatures? They're kind of cute--in a lizardy, scaly sort of chicken way. I love the little guys!"
"219317028-0-1045";"Woodworking is so relaxing, especially when I'm working on something that really matters. I was watching a few bantam guar frolicking outside my tavern the other day, pecking for food and doing their little dance, when the sky opened and a drenching rain fell. That's when I decided. Those guar need a place to live--and I'm going to build it!"
"219317028-0-1046";"Margog the Hammer again. Along with this batch of material, here are more details on the bantam guar house I'm building behind my tavern. It's got four entrances, two exits, three levels, and an exterior deck so the guar can sun themselves. I'm also adding two feeding troughs and three fountains so there's plenty of food and water to go around."
"219317028-0-1047";"Calm. Serene. Woodworking does wonders for my aggressive tendencies. I haven't wanted to hit anyone in days! Must have something to do with banging nails into wood, I guess. Anyway, the bantam guar house is almost ready for the little guys to move into. I can't wait to see how they like it! In the meantime, this package is for you."
"219317028-0-1048";"It's done and it's a masterpiece. Maybe my finest work ever. A home worthy of the most noble of bantam guar, with plenty of room for lots of inhabitants. I can't wait to see how they like it. The water and food troughs are full, the doors are open, and it's all ready for the little guys to move in. I had some materials left over, so here you go."
"219317028-0-1049";"Oh no! My perfect bantam guar cottage has become a home for wayward scuttlers! Those pests moved right in and made themselves comfortable, eating all the food and drinking all the water. Now they won't move out and the poor bantam guar remain homeless. I guess I could construct a second house. But I need to hurry before the rainy season begins."
"219317028-0-1050";"Margog the Hammer again. Did you miss me? Here're your components. Have you ever heard the saying, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" Well, that's got me thinking. I have two enemies at the moment: Splendid-Paws and Constable Chedric. They also are opposed to each other. I wonder if I should ally myself with one of them. For convenience's sake."
"219317028-0-1051";"I extended the hand of friendship to Constable Chedric. That was a mistake! He looked like I tried to offer him a poisonous viper instead of a handshake. Then he went on a short tirade about how he would never allow himself to associate with scum like me. If I were a sensitive sort, his words would have cut me like a knife. Instead I just hit him."
"219317028-0-1052";"Hello again, boss. My recent efforts to befriend Constable Chedric have met with failure. The good and noble constable, it seems, is too pure to associate with a common woodworker, tavern owner, and somewhat shady entrepreneur such as me. Oh well. I don't really like the man much, anyway. I guess I should go talk to Splendid-Paws next."
"219317028-0-1053";"Now I'm nervous. That cagey Khajiit showed up at my tavern and offered to buy me a drink before I could do the same at his place. Splendid-Paws has been a thorn in my side almost from the day I met him, but it seems we'd rather team up than allow Constable Chedric to take us both out of the picture. And at least I know there's no poison in my ale."
"219317028-0-1054";"Splendid-Paws the Khajiit crime lord is a surprisingly pleasant fellow. He tells amusing stories, laughs at jokes, and knows how to hold his liquor. He does have an annoying habit of talking about himself in the third person, but I suppose nobody's perfect. He eventually got around to why he was here. ""It's time to retire the constable,"" he said."
"219317028-0-1055";"Boss, this is by no means a confession. It's just talk between business associates, understand? And when Splendid-Paws used the word ""retire,"" he just meant ""put out to pasture,"" ""take out the trash,"" ""dispose of the problem,"" or ""liquidate our stock."" And by ""stock,"" I mean the good Constable Chedric. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1056";"What an amazing world this is. Who would have ever thought that Splendid-Paws the crime lord and Margog the Hammer would ever work together on anything. But as my hunt-mother used to say, you can't take down a mastodon with a single arrow, no matter how steady your aim. In this case, Constable Chedric is our mastodon. And we need two arrows."
"219317028-0-1057";"We decided that we had to be discrete in our efforts to remove Constable Chedric. Make his disappearance too spectacular and we run the risk of bringing even more law-enforcers down upon our little hamlet. We also had to be precise. Missing a target such as the good constable is a sure way to turn the pointed side of the arrow in your direction."
"219317028-0-1058";"So discretion and precision were the keystones of our operation. And since neither of us trusted our own associates to excel at either of those approaches, we decided that a hired expert was in order. We agreed to split the cost, but somehow it fell to me to make contact with the expert. And by expert, I mean the Dark Brotherhood."
"219317028-0-1059";"Hello, boss. I don't know if you've ever tried to set up a meeting with the Dark Brotherhood, but what a pain in the arse! First, I need to perform some sort of ritual with the delightful-sounding name of ""the Black Sacrament."" Where in the world am I going to find a heart, a skull, bones, and flesh? If you have any suggestions, pass them along."
"219317028-0-1060";"What a gruesome ritual! I made an effigy of Constable Chedric, as instructed, but I'm still waiting for the Nightshade petals to arrive from the alchemist. Then I have to sit inside a circle of candles, stab the effigy, and whisper some inane words that don't make a lick of sense. If this is just an elaborate prank, someone's going to get hurt."
"219317028-0-1061";"I was beginning to think the whole ritual thing to summon a representative of the Dark Brotherhood was some kind of prank to make me look silly, but no sooner had I finished reciting the words than a figure in a black-hooded robe stepped out of the shadows. ""Who do you need dealt with, petitioner?"" the hooded figure asked."
"219317028-0-1062";"Those sermons I endured at the side of the priest of Mara must have rubbed off on me, after all. Staring into the depths of that shadowy hood, I suddenly didn't want to go through with this dark contract anymore. What was I thinking, trying to have an officer of the law assassinated by the Dark Brotherhood? I'm sure the figure will understand."
"219317028-0-1063";"""You made a mistake?"" the dark figure said with more than a hint of incredulity. ""That must be the first time such a thing has happened. You mistakenly built an effigy, set up candles, accidentally stabbed the effigy multiple times, and inadvertently spoke the prescribed words of power. Is that what you're telling me?"" I nodded an affirmation."
"219317028-0-1064";"""Let me get this straight,"" the figure in the black-hooded robe said, asking me to clarify the situation for the third time. ""You really didn't mean to contact the Dark Brotherhood? You don't want to have someone put to death? So, in essence, you've wasted my time? Is that what you'd have me believe?"" I nodded earnestly and apologized profusely."
"219317028-0-1065";"Well, boss, deciding not to make a deal with the Dark Brotherhood was the most stressful moment of my life. I was certain that the black-hooded figure wanted to kill something, and if it wasn't going to be for a contract then my blood would have to do. I offered to compensate him for his trouble, hoping I'd live to send you more components."
"219317028-0-1066";"The hooded figure begrudgingly took the gold I offered, mumbling under her breath. ""Stupid, Orc,"" and ""waste of time,"" were the only words I heard clearly enough to understand. Then the figure turned back to me and pointed a wickedly curved dagger. ""One mistake is all you get, Orc,"" the figure said. ""Don't make me regret even that much leniency."""
"219317028-0-1067";"Boss, it's Margog the Hammer here. I have a bit of a dilemma. Since I decided not to go through with the Dark Brotherhood contract, I need to figure out if I'm going to adhere to my deal with Splendid-Paws the crime lord or reach out to Constable Chedric. I'm in a quandary. Neither option really appeals to me, but I can't see an alternative."
"219317028-0-1068";"Here you go. Another shipment of crafting materials. I couldn't sleep last night, anyway, so I figured I might as well do something useful. Now, as dawn breaks over our little town, I need to decide on the lesser of two evils. Should I come up with another way to fulfill my deal with Splendid-Paws, or should I ally myself with Constable Chedric?"
"219317028-0-1069";"My life was much simpler and clear-cut when I was just a woodworker, before I became an entrepreneur. Now things have become exceedingly complex. I find I need to be much more subtle in my dealings. Not everything can be dealt with using a hammer and a nail. That was the thought going through my head as I went out to deal with Constable Chedric."
"219317028-0-1070";"The good constable was surprised to see me when I entered his tiny keep. It was basically a two-story, free-standing tower that served as his office, the town jail, and his living quarters. The life of a law officer certainly isn't glamorous, but I don't suppose glamour is what drives that sort of person. I closed the door behind me."
"219317028-0-1071";"The deed done, my next stop was a visit to my current partner-in-crime, the Khajiit named Splendid-Paws. Usually my rival, the crime lord and I had come to an arrangement of sorts because of the threat posed by Constable Chedric. But now that I had made sure the law officer wouldn't be a problem any longer, I had to deal with Splendid-Paws."
"219317028-0-1072";"""This one would like to know, have you dealt with our problem?"" Splendid-Paws asked. ""Speak plainly,"" I retorted, ""you know I can't understand when you speak cat."" Anger flared across the crime lord's eyes, but he composed himself and said, ""Constable Chedric. Did you do as this one asked and had the law-enforcer eliminated?"""
"219317028-0-1073";"""I've taken care of the good constable,"" I said. ""He won't be bothering me again."" I caught the shift in Splendid-Paws' eyes as he came to the sudden realization that something was terribly wrong. That's when Chedric marched in, all full of law and self-righteousness. ""I accept your confession, cat,"" he declared. ""It's the dungeon for you."""
"219317028-0-1074";"I thought that Splendid-Paws would have put up a fight. Maybe get himself killed trying to escape from Constable Chedric and the long arm of justice. But no. Instead, the crime lord held up his arms and stated simply, ""Splendid-Paws yields, law-enforcer."" He gave me a pointed look as the constable's deputies led him away."
"219317028-0-1075";"Hello, boss. Margog the Hammer, at your service. I hope these components find you well. Things in Forlorn are better than ever, now that the Khajiit crime lord has been locked away. And the deal I made with Constable Chedric should hold for a while, provided I don't engage in anything too overt--at least when the good constable is around."
"219317028-0-1076";"I started another woodworking project. It feels good to have a saw and hammer in my hands again. Sometimes the life of an entrepreneur is too busy and there's no time for the things I love. But this project should keep me occupied. I'm going to build a keepsake chest, carved with scenes from popular legends and stories. It's a great idea!"
"219317028-0-1077";"Hello, boss. The new project is going fine. The chest is beautiful, with a hinged lid and a hidden compartment. I'm trying to decide which story to carve on the lid. Should I go with ""Netches All Around"" or ""The Brave Little Scrib?"" What do you think? Both stories were favorites of mine when I was an Orc cub, so I can't make up my mind."
"219317028-0-1078";"After much deliberation and soul-searching, I decided to go with the story of ""The Brave Little Scrib"" as the carving on my keepsake chest. It's such a heart-warming and uplifting tale! I enlisted Kwela to help me. She's a remarkable artist. I'll use her illustration as the basis for the carving. If it turns out well, maybe I'll make another one."
"219317028-0-1079";"I finished the keepsake chest with its beautiful carving of a scene from the story of ""The Brave Little Scrib."" Almost as soon as I put the piece out to display in my tavern, a traveler offered two-hundred gold to take it off my hands.  Two-hundred gold! I think I might have a lucrative side business in the construction of wooden keepsake chests."
"219317028-0-1080";"I was summoned to Chedric's keep for a private audience with the captive Khajiit, Splendid-Paws. For a prisoner, the crime lord sure seemed content and comfortable in his holding cell. ""Before this one is shipped to the capital for judgment,"" Splendid-Paws said, ""this one would repay you for the service you have provided."" That didn't sound good."
"219317028-0-1081";"So Splendid-Paws wants to repay me for betraying him to Constable Chedric. I don't like the sound of that, but he's on the other side of a locked cage. ""This one is not angry with you, Orc,"" he said calmly. ""This one thanks you for uncomplicating matters for me. This one bequeaths his holdings to you. All of them."" And that sounds worse."
"219317028-0-1082";"Splendid-Paws made me the executor of his criminal and legitimate holdings. Some might see that as a reward, but I was pretty sure the crime lord was setting me up for a fall. A really big fall. What could possibly go wrong, you ask? Well, so did I. ""You also inherit all of this one's debts and obligations,"" Splendid-Paws said with a wicked smile."
"219317028-0-1083";"Well, boss, Splendid-Paws did it. He's effectively tied a Mundus Stone around my neck and tossed me into a deep, dark lake. His debts and obligations, of which I am now responsible, include three wives and thirty-seven children back in Elsweyr, a loan held by Captain Ka'din of the Renrijra pirates, and a blood feud with the Koskit crime syndicate."
"219317028-0-1084";"Here you go, boss. Another shipment of crafting components provided by Margog the Hammer. I plan to continue to fulfill my obligation to you for as long as I'm able, but Splendid-Paws' enemies are already lining up to take a shot at me, his reluctantly named successor. And someone arrived in town today who has been asking a lot of questions."
"219317028-0-1085";"Damn Splendid-Paws and his criminal empire! Damn them to Oblivion! He's cursed me with debts and obligations that will be the death of me unless I can figure a way out of this mess. Do you know who showed up today? One of the cat's brothers or nephews or whatever strange familial ties they share has challenged me for control of the organization!"
"219317028-0-1086";"Her name's Fancy-Fur, and it turns out she's Splendid-Paws' oldest daughter. She wants to fight me for control of the Khajiit's criminal holdings. It's her birthright, she says. I tried to get the cat to just change his mind and give his debts and obligations to her, but he refused. ""If she decides to kill you, so be it,"" Splendid-Paws laughed."
"219317028-0-1087";"This is the instrument of Splendid-Paws' revenge--his headstrong and vibrant daughter, Fancy-Fur. She plans to kill me during our battle to control the Khajiit crime lord's massive amount of holdings. Holdings, I might add, that I have no interest in retaining! But you can't talk sense to an impassioned Khajiit female. Or so my hunt-mother told me."
"219317028-0-1088";"The constable came by before the challenge. I thought he was going to say how sorry he was for getting me into this, but instead he chided me for being stupid enough to fall into Splendid-Paws' trap. ""They call her the Dark Claw,"" he said, ""because she's the death you never see coming."" I guess he thought that would cheer me up. Not so much."
"219317028-0-1089";"No matter what trouble I've gotten myself into, your shipments will continue to arrive on time--at least until Fancy-Fur guts me like a fish. And in that case, I've made arrangements with another woodworker to take over my list of clients. So never fear, you'll be well taken care of. In the meantime, I need to figure out how to survive this mess."
"219317028-0-1090";"Constable Chedric did eventually offer me one piece of advice before he departed to find a good spot to watch the coming battle. ""Lead with your left,"" he said, ""it's your strongest move."" I nodded and asked if he thought I could beat her. ""Not a chance in Oblivion,"" he said, ""but I'll be rooting for you anyway."" Law-enforcers! What good are they?"
"219317028-0-1091";"Margog the Hammer here. Let me tell you about my day. It all started when Splendid-Paws' daughter Fancy-Fur challenged me to a death duel for control of her father's criminal holdings. Holdings I never even asked for! I was tricked into this situation by the Khajiit. It's his way of getting revenge on me for turning him over to the constable."
"219317028-0-1092";"I carried my latest keepsake chest out into the street so I could deliver it to Klari the Alchemist before the battle. She commissioned it a few weeks' back, requesting I carve a scene from ""The Brave Little Scrib"" on the lid. Fancy-Fur approached to take a look at the chest, running a paw over the engraved scene. Tears welled in her eyes."
"219317028-0-1093";"""Brave Little Scrib,"" said Fancy-Fur as she examined my latest keepsake chest. ""That was always my favorite story,"" she said, tears welling in her eyes. ""Father used to read it to me. When he was home."" Something was happening here, but I wasn't sure what it was. ""You crafted this?"" she asked. I did the only sensible thing. I nodded affirmatively."
"219317028-0-1094";"""The tale of the Brave Little Scrib tells the story of a noble soul,"" Fancy-Fur said, ""and you have captured that spirit with marvelous precision."" I replied that I liked to work with wood, and that it was my favorite story, too. She looked deep into my eyes. ""I can't kill such a gifted crafter,"" she said, ""so how will we settle this situation?"""
"219317028-0-1095";"Constable Chedric approached as Fancy-Fur contemplated not killing me. I wasn't completely sure what was happening, but it seemed like our mutual affection for the Brave Little Scrib was going to save my life. ""I see only one solution to this situation,"" Chedric said. ""Explain yourself, law-enforcer,"" Fancy-Fur said, wiping away a tear. So he did."
"219317028-0-1096";"""Marriage!"" Fancy-Fur and I exclaimed. ""It's the only logical solution,"" Chedric continued, a barely perceptible smirk on his lips. ""You get to share control of both families' holdings, and no one has to die in the process."" I looked over at Fancy-Fur. She was sort of attractive, but maybe I ought to take my chances in battle after all."
"219317028-0-1097";"Here you go, boss. More items for your crafting. Meanwhile, Fancy-Fur and I went back into my tavern and had a nice long talk. Turns out, she's a really interesting young woman--for a violent and obsessive Khajiit who happens to be the daughter of my greatest rival. I think we're going to try this marriage arrangement. What could possibly go wrong?"
"219317028-0-1098";"It goes against Orc tradition. It certainly violates every tenet of Khajiit culture. But you know what? Neither Fancy-Fur or I give a skeever's arse about culture or tradition! We've merged our holdings and have agreed to run our operations--both legal and illegal--from a position of cooperation and mutual respect as husband and wife. Eat that, cat!"
"219317028-0-1099";"Fancy-Fur and I went to visit Splendid-Paws today. They're sending him to the capital for his trial tomorrow, but we wanted to let him know how everything turned out. He was as furious as I hoped. Revenge is best when turned on its side, or so my hunt-mother used to say. He promised to make us regret this betrayal as we walked away, hand in hand"
"219317028-0-1100";"Margog the Hammer and Fancy-Fur, at your service! Life has gotten extremely busy, boss, but we promise you'll never miss out on crafting components. Our other businesses are thriving, too. Constable Chedric keeps an eye on us, but he seems more interested than hostile these days. I'm surprised, but I feel as happy as the Brave Little Scrib!"
"219317028-0-1101";"Greetings! I am Aksel Rockbiter. I heard a lot about you. I am sure you have heard of me too. I am the greatest finder of things ever! I have made my first delivery. I hope you enjoy it. More will come soon! - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1102";"Hello. It is me again, Aksel. Aksel Rockbiter. I hope you used my first delivery to make swords that kill people. I like swords. Sharp ones are best, but sometimes I cut myself with them. Anyway, here are some supplies. Enjoy!"
"219317028-0-1103";"Aksel here. Thank you for the monies. I use them to buy potions for Mother. She has pains in her joints. The potions help. I rub them on her joints. Sometimes I do not like this, but she is my Mother. So I rub. I will write soon, Aksel Rockbiter."
"219317028-0-1104";"Guess who this is. No, it is Aksel! I write you again to tell you I have found more supplies for you. You sound like a good blacksmith, so I think you need lots of supplies. And so I bring some. Your friend, Aksel Rockbiter."
"219317028-0-1105";"You have needs, Aksel provides! Once again, supplies for you. I hope you are using them to make swords. Swords are nice. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1106";"Sorry these supplies are late. Mother had her pains again. Much rubbing was needed. I was late filling your order. Please do not fire me. It will not happen again."
"219317028-0-1107";"Someone tried to poke me with a sword today. I hope is was not one of yours, as it broke. I know you would not make such a bad sword, not with the good supplies I send you. Best wishes, Aksel."
"219317028-0-1108";"Mother hit me today. She says my writing is not good. I say it is the thought that matters. She says my thoughts are not good too. I am sad but I still send supplies. I hope you are still my friend. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1109";"I hope you are well. Mother says that maybe you do not make swords at all. May be you make armor. I like swords, but armor is good too. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1110";"I am sorry if you ran out of supplies. Here are more. Please do not fire me. I had to travel very far to find them. I was late getting home and Mother was very worried. She hit me many times. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1111";"Sometimes, I wonder about this line of work. Mother says it is not good for me. Too many people and monsters try to kill me when I look for your supplies. Do not worry, I am still alive. And I am still Aksel Rockbiter."
"219317028-0-1112";"I hope you like what I found for you today. I am very proud of myself. I had to fight a big bear and two little bears for it! The little bears bit my ankles. That hurt but I can still walk. Slowly. Enjoy your supplies."
"219317028-0-1113";"Greetings. Very sore today. Sent what I could find. Hope it is enough. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1114";"Feeling much better today. I know you were worried. Worry no more, my friend. I hope you are happy with your supplies today. I was happy not to be so sore. I think we are both happy. That makes me happy. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1115";"Sometimes, I wish you were a breadsmith. Bread is easy to find! Your supplies are not easy to find. Also, bread is easy to work with too! It is very soft. And if you make mistakes, you can eat them! Think of it, please."
"219317028-0-1116";"Mother says I am dumb. She says that a lot. She says that you will think I do not want to bring you supplies anymore. That is not true! I love bringing you supplies. Here are some more. Please do not fire me. - Aksel (Aksel Rockbiter)"
"219317028-0-1117";"I do not like Mother, sometimes. She is mean. Could I come live with you? I could bring your supplies faster that way. Think of it. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1118";"Forget I said that thing I said yesterday. I love Mother. She told me so and said I could not leave. I leave your supplies for you and now go home to Mother. -Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1119";"Do you have someone to love? I hope so. I have Mother and she says that is all I need. A Mother's love is the best love, I am told. Enjoy your supplies. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1120";"I worked extra hard today to get you your supplies. I hope you are happy. Mother sends her love. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1121";"Today was a good day. Lots of supplies for you. And Mother has gone to visit her sister, so the hut is all mine. It is a very good day. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1122";"Mother still visiting her sister. My friends visited last night. We drank a lot of mead, which Mother does not allow. It was a good night but today is a bad day. My head hurts but I still found supplies for you. -Askel Bockriter"
"219317028-0-1123";"Another bad day. Mother is back. She is mad. After drinking mead, my friends wore all her clothes. It was funny but now they are all ripped. Mother yelled at me. All night. Here are your supplies. I go to sleep now. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1124";"Mother took all my monies! To buy new clothes! I say unfair but she hit me until I gave her the monies. Now I need more so here are some supplies. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1125";"I am not speaking to Mother today. She has all new clothes. With my monies. It is not fair. I will not speak to her until she gives me my monies back. Enjoy your supplies."
"219317028-0-1126";"I did not sleep in the hut last night. Mother yelled too much. I sleeped in a barn. A cow pooped on me during the night. A little got on your supplies but I scraped it off. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1127";"I met a girl today! She is very nice. I like her. She says I am big and strong. Mother says I am little and weak. Her name is Narasgi. The girl, not Mother. I am very excited. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1128";"Narasgi wrote her name on my arm. That is how I remember. She helped me get your supplies today. That is why they are here so soon. Your friend, Aksel."
"219317028-0-1129";"I am very excited again. Tonight, I bring Narasgi home to Mother. Mother will love her, I am sure. I almost forget your supplies, I am so excited, but Narasgi reminded me. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1130";"Mother did not like Narasgi. I am sure you are surprised. I was sure Mother would love her like I do. As soon as we got home, Mother yelled at me and hit me. Then Narasgi yelled at Mother and hit her. There was no dinner."
"219317028-0-1131";"Today was a bad day. Mother was mad at me. Narasgi was mad at me. I hope you are not mad at me too. Have some supplies. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1132";"Mother and Narasgi are not talking to me today. Not sure if this is a good day or a bad one. More supplies for you. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1133";"Good day today. Good supplies for you. And Naragsi talked to me today! She told me to shut up and go away. She still likes me!"
"219317028-0-1134";"Hello again. Mother still not speaking to me. I like it. Naragsi helped me get your supplies. May be you can smell her perfume on them? That is the best smell. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1135";"Mother spoke to me today. Very loudly. She does not like Narasgi. She says Narasgi wants to kill her and eat her. I do not think so. Narasgi is not Bosmer, I do not think. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1136";"It is Aksel again. Narasgi says to ignore Mother. I cannot ignore Mother. I do not know what ignore means. I am confused. But I left supplies for you."
"219317028-0-1137";"Narasgi is very good to me. She is teaching me to write better. You may have seen that writing is hard for me. But no more! I will still get supplies for you, never fear! - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1138";"It is me, Aksel. Narasgi taught me to spell the right way. I am very proud. I hope you enjoy your supplies very much. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1139";"Mother still does not like Narasgi. She says she is bossy and mean. Narasgi tells me to ignore Mother. She told me what that means too, so now I will try. But Mother is hard to ignore.—Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1140";"I am better now. Narasgi likes me again, I am sure. And when Mother talks about her, I do the ignore. This makes me happy. I hope you are happy with your supplies. - Your friend very much, Aksel"
"219317028-0-1141";"How is Mother like a tree? They are both best when they leave! Narasgi told me that joke today. I laughed so hard mead came out my nose. I did not tell Mother the joke. I think she would not like it. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1142";"Mother is mad at me. Every time I see her, I think of Narasgi's joke and I laugh. But I can't tell Mother what is funny. That makes her mad. Enjoy your supplies!"
"219317028-0-1143";"I was bit by wolves today. I was looking for your supplies when I saw a tree. I thought of Mother and laughed again, very loud. Wolves heard me and bit me all over. Some blood is on your supplies. I hope you do not mind. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1144";"Hello, my friend! Another good day today. I spent it with Narasgi. We looked for your supplies, of course. Enjoy your day! - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1145";"It is very strange, how happy I feel. May be it is Narasgi. May be it is Mother not speaking to me again. May be both. Anyway I am happy. I hope you are too. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1146";"I like being Aksel very much. Every time Narasgi says my name, I feel funny in my stomach. Sometimes I throw up, which makes Narasgi laugh. I like to make her laugh but I do not like to throw up. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1147";"I thought a lot today. Thinking hurts my head so I try not to do it. Narasgi is a nice girl. She reminds me of Mother. A lot. I got your supplies. Now I must lie down for awhile, then think some more. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1148";"It is Aksel again. I think I will ask Narasgi to marry me. I think this is a good idea. I think I need to lie down again."
"219317028-0-1149";"Hello friend. I am going to ask Narasgi to marry me. Today. My stomach feels very funny. I hope I do not throw up on Narasgi until after I ask her. Wish me lucks! - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1150";"Aksel here. I asked her. Then I threw up. That was a mistake. Narasgi asked for time to think. I hope it does not hurt her head. I got supplies for you while waiting for Narasgi to think."
"219317028-0-1151";"Narasgi still thinking. I am worried. It does not take me that long to think. Mother says Narasgi does not like me. Sometimes I hate Mother. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1152";"I am very sad. Narasgi is still thinking. Mother is right. She does not love me. Narasgi, not Mother. Mother loves me. She tells me all the time. May be a mother's love is best. I am still sad though. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1153";"Happy, happy, happy! Narasgi will marry me! I am so happy. Mother was wrong! Here are your supplies, I must go see Narasgi again. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1154";"I am happy, Narasgi is happy, Mother is mad. I hope you are happy not mad. Mother yells when she is mad. You do not yell at me. That is why I like you. Plus the monies you send me. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1155";"Narasgi thinks we should get a hut of our own when we are married. Mother thinks Narasgi should get a hut and live there alone. I like Narasgi's idea better. More supplies for you!"
"219317028-0-1156";"This is Aksel. Sorry I was late with your supplies. Mother and Narasgi were fighting and my head hurt. Mother wants to live with us in our hut. Narasgi said over her dead body. Mother said that would be nice. Then they fought. My head hurts again."
"219317028-0-1157";"They are still fighting. Mother and Narasgi. I stayed away all day, getting supplies for you. I am afraid to go back to the hut. I will sleep on the ground tonight and hope the bears do not eat me. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1158";"The bears did not eat me. It is Aksel, if you could not tell. I have not gone home yet. The woods seem safer. I found lots of supplies for you. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1159";"I went home today. Mother is not speaking to me again. But she did speak to tell me she was mad at me. Then she stopped. It was nice. Here are your supplies.—Aksel"
"219317028-0-1160";"Narasgi says that you are not interested in my personal life. I do not believe that as you are my friend. I will keep telling you things but not tell Narasgi. You do not tell her too please. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1161";"Is blacksmith a dangerous job? Narasgi thinks my job is too full of danger. She wants me to do a safer job once we are married. But I like my job. Today I found some good supplies for you. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1162";"Narasgi and me had our first fight. It was about you. I want to keep working for you. She does not want me to. We talked about it all day, sometimes very loudly. We are not talking now. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1163";"Aksel here. We are talking again. Narasgi and me. She wants to get married right away. Mother says we should wait. I have to go lie down and think. I hope it does not hurt too much."
"219317028-0-1164";"My head hurts today. Narasgi and me are getting married tomorrow. We found you some good supplies today and did not fight at all. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1165";"I am married! To Narasgi! Oh, it is me, Aksel. Left you some supplies. Must go now. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1166";"Married life is good! I do not know why I did not get married long ago. But no one would have me, I guess. Must go now. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1167";"Now that I am married, I must provide for my family. Mother and Narasgi tell me this. So I am working extra hard to find you good supplies. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1168";"Narasgi is with me all the time now. Mother has told her she must keep an eye on me. I do not know why. But we find supplies for you very fast now! Your friend, Aksel."
"219317028-0-1169";"Hello. It is me. Aksel. Narasgi and me worked all morning to find supplies for you. Then we looked at huts. For us to live in. Huts cost a lot of monies. We need to find many more supplies for you."
"219317028-0-1170";"Here are your supplies, early today. More hut shopping for me and Narasgi. Life was simpler when I lived with Mother but not as much fun. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1171";"Huts, huts, huts. I am sick of looking at huts! I never want to see another hut! I said this to Narasgi and she growled at me. She never growled at me before we were married. More huts tomorrow I think. - Aksel."
"219317028-0-1172";"I had a good idea. We could live in Mother's hut! With Mother! It would save lots of monies. Narasgi growled at me again. So I went out and found some supplies for you. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1173";"Aksel Rockbiter here. I am sending your supplies before Narasgi and me go looking at huts again. I do not say I am sick of looking at huts anymore. Goodbye for now."
"219317028-0-1174";"Today was a good day. Narasgi said she is sick of looking at huts! We spent all day finding your supplies. I hope you make some good swords with them! - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1175";"We are going to stay with Mother! Oh, this is Aksel. Narasgi says we will live with Mother until we can buy a hut of our own. Now to tell Mother the good news. I left supplies for you in the same place. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1176";"Mother does not want us! I am very sad. Narasgi is very mad. She told me to find your supplies and she will talk to Mother again. I hope they do not hurt each other. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1177";"Mother wants us! She and Narasgi talked and talked. Mother has black eyes from all the talking. And now she wants us to live in her hut! I am so happy. I almost forgot your supplies, but here they are. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1178";"Narasgi moved into Mother's hut today. I moved back in too. Mother made me sleep outside with the pigs since me and Narasgi got married. I will have a good sleep tonight. Supplies are here for you. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1179";"I had a good sleep. I hope you did too. Narasgi snores but I put mud in my ears and slept. Oh, this is Aksel Rockbiter again. I have your supplies, as always."
"219317028-0-1180";"Mother complained about Narasgi snoring. She complained loudly. Then Narasgi looked at her and Mother stopped complaining. That has never happened before. I am happy they are getting along so good. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1181";"A quiet hut is a happy hut. I made that up just now. Me, Aksel Rockbiter! Our hut is very happy. Mother is very quiet. Sometimes I forget she is even here. Life is good. Your supplies are good too. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1182";"More supplies for you! Narasgi sent me out early today. She and Mother are moving furniture. We have only three tree stumps for chairs and one big stump for a table but it took them all day. I am just happy they are happy. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1183";"Do you know any more blacksmiths? Narasgi wants me to make more monies. I will be very busy with more customers but Narasgi does not mind. She says it is good for me to be out in the fresh air. She is very good to me. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1184";"I found another blacksmith! I am very happy. I will try very hard to not mix up your supplies with hers. Narasgi says Mother will help me. I left supplies for you. I hope they are yours. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1185";"Narasgi found me two more blacksmiths to supply. She says we must diverspiffy...spread out. I am very very busy now. Your friend Aksel."
"219317028-0-1186";"Do not worry. You are my best blacksmith. The others mean nothing to me. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1187";"Are you happy with your supplies? Narasgi says your happiness is very important to us. Please let Mother know if you are not happy. She handles all our complaints. - Aksel of The Aksel Rockbiter Supply Company"
"219317028-0-1188";"I am sorry about my last note. Narasgi made me write it. I write this note in secret. I hope you are still my friend even though I find supplies for other blacksmiths. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1189";"Too busy to write much. Your supplies are here. Your friend Aksel."
"219317028-0-1190";"Narasgi and me had our first married fight. I am too tired from finding all the supplies. I can not do this any more. I said this to Narasgi and she said I am a bad husband. Today was a bad day. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1191";"It is Aksel again. Narasgi and me are still fighting. I want to work only for you but Narasgi says that is not enough monies. Mother says she is on my side but when Narasgi is near she says nothing. but I still found supplies for you. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1192";"Narasgi is mad at me. She says I must find supplies for two blacksmiths but I can stop finding supplies for the others. I am happy. I was getting very tired. You are one of the two of course. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1193";"I am very happy today. I am not tired and have so much energy! I found good supplies for you. I think you will be very happy. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1194";"Narasgi and Mother are looking for furniture today. I hope it does not cost too many monies. We do not have many monies. But Narasgi says we need a bed. Mother says straw on the floor is good enough for us. Then she and Narasgi had a fight. -Aksel"
"219317028-0-1195";"I do not like our new bed. It is too high off the ground. I worry about falling out at night and hurting myself. Or landing on Mother on the floor by the bed. Oh, this is Aksel. Your supplies are waiting."
"219317028-0-1196";"I fell out of bed last night. Five times. My ankle hurts. I had to walk on it all day to find your supplies. I hope you are happy. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1197";"My ankle is better today. I am getting used to the bed. I fell out only three times last night! but I stepped on Mother once and she is mad at me. More supplies for you. - Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1198";"I like our new bed. You should get one. It is good to sleep in a bed. Or under it. Mother sleeps there now so I do not step on her at night. I get more rest now so I find you lots of supplies. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1199";"Narasgi and me found supplies for you today. Narasgi told me she loves me. Then she hit me so it must be true. I am very happy. - Aksel"
"219317028-0-1200";"Today was a good day. I think tomorrow will be too. I am happy, Narasgi is happy, Mother is almost happy. I hope you are happy. As always, supplies for you. - Your friend always, Aksel Rockbiter"
"219317028-0-1202";"Thank you so much for allowing me to handle all your enchanting component needs. You will never have reason to regret or fear your arrangement with Melina Cassel. My base of operations is Castle Ravenwatch in the kingdom of Rivenspire, though I range far and wide to gather the best materials for your use. On that, you have my word."
"219317028-0-1203";"Patron. May these components find you well. Do not let the rumors and innuendos trouble you. House Ravenwatch, to whom I owe allegiance, is an ancient and honored house. It wields much respect and power in Rivenspire. Anything you may have heard to the contrary is most likely not true. And it should not affect our arrangement in the slightest."
"219317028-0-1204";"Not only am I an excellent purveyor of enchanting components, I am an accomplished enchanter in my own right. I am still a relative novice, but I grow more skilled every day. Never fear, however. I will never keep the choicest materials for my own use. That would be a conflict of interest. As you can see by this shipment, I share and share alike."
"219317028-0-1205";"Lady Melina Cassel of House Ravenwatch here! I apologize for the tardiness of this shipment, but circumstances beyond my control limit my component collection activities to the darkest hours of the night. I don't want to worry you, but I have a peculiar condition that requires I stay out of the sunshine. I do my best hunting at night, however."
"219317028-0-1206";"Ah, I love the night! The darkness is so peaceful, so serene. I don't see why people find it frightening. The night is not to be feared. It is to be enjoyed! Now, the things that wander around in the darkness are an entirely different matter, but we cannot allow a few hooligans to ruin the experience for the rest of us. Your shipment is enclosed."
"219317028-0-1207";"Melina Cassel again, writing to you in the darkest hours before the dawn. I hope this package of enchanting components reaches you in a timely manner. I continue to endeavor to make sure you rarely notice my peculiar affectation, though I guess I should refrain from mentioning it so often. In the meantime, enjoy these components."
"219317028-0-1208";"Have I told you about Estelle? She is one of the servants at Castle Ravenwatch. She does everything around the castle--she cooks, she cleans, she mends our cloaks. I hesitate to mention, but she also provides a service beyond the call of duty. I will not bore you with the details, but without her, life at the castle would be much more difficult."
"219317028-0-1209";"I suppose I should tell you something about life at the castle. I am one of the wards of Count Verandis Ravenwatch. I live here with Adusa and Gwendis, and they are my very best of friends! In addition to studying enchanting and providing components to patrons such as yourself, I learn to cope with ""our special gifts,"" as the Count calls them."
"219317028-0-1210";"We also have a number of trusted and devoted servants. Estelle is one, as is Kalin, though he often travels with the Count. The castle and its grounds are extensive, and there are many chambers within its thick, stone walls. I love it here! But the Count has so many rules. Sometimes I think the rules hinder us, but I suppose the Count knows best."
"219317028-0-1211";"I was mentioning the rules we must follow here at Castle Ravenwatch. I'm certain they are similar to the instructions your elders set for you. We must not eat to indulgence. We must not kill our food. We must not hunt innocent blood. All rather standard fare. But the Count and Adusa are sticklers that we follow these rules to the letter."
"219317028-0-1212";"As I was saying. Rules. I believe they were created to be broken. Gwendis agrees with me. I'm sure you do, too. How can we strive for greatness if we can't leap over the boundaries that surround us? I say leap, my patron, leap! But don't let Adusa know. She refuses to break so much as an egg, let alone a rule. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1213";"Another evening of resource collection, another shipment of components. Thus, the cycle of patron and hireling continues. On my most recent outing, I happened upon an unusual sight—three happy Scamps dancing merrily within a circle of glowing stones. I watched for a time, fascinated, when I noticed another figure in their midst."
"219317028-0-1214";"The figure that the Scamps were dancing around was a young man, bound in thick ropes and gagged with a piece of ratty old cloth. He looked frightened. Not at all as happy and gay as the prancing Scamps. I felt sorry for the prisoner, but I also wanted to throw off my clothes and run into the circle to dance with the Scamps. Is that strange?"
"219317028-0-1215";"No, patron. I didn't throw off my clothes and run naked into the glowing circle of stones. Just get that image right out of your head this very instant! Although I really wanted to get naked and dance, truth be told. Oh, very well! Imagine away. Here's your shipment of components."
"219317028-0-1216";"So there I was, fascinated by the prancing Scamps and concerned about the captive young man in equal measure. It dawned on me that I was being influenced by some kind of charm or enchantment, and that piqued my interest even more. It was time to live up to the code of House Ravenwatch and take action. After I send you these components."
"219317028-0-1217";"It was a simple matter to startle the prancing Scamps and send them scurrying into the darkness. Stepping into the glowing circle of rocks, however, was another matter entirely. As soon as my foot broke the border of the circle, the desire to start dancing once again rose inside me like lava rushing to erupt from the mouth of a bubbling volcano."
"219317028-0-1218";"It took an extreme effort not to succumb to the silent beat of the enchantment. I drew back my foot. Then, in a burst of inspiration, I kicked out and knocked over one of the glowing stones. The glow faded and the desire to dance popped like a soap bubble. I'm not sure I expected gratitude, but the fear in the captive's eyes seemed uncalled for."
"219317028-0-1219";"Turns out, the fear in the young man's eyes had nothing to do with me. Instead, it was directed toward the menacing figure sneaking up behind me. I barely dodged out of the way as the Daedra-worshiping cultist tried to swing his sword through the spot where my neck had been a moment before. But I haven't forgotten—your components are included."
"219317028-0-1220";"Dear patron, I won't bore you with the details of how I dealt with the Daedric cultist. Nor do I want to burden you with facts about me that would at best upset you and at worst make you see me in an unfavorable light. Suffice it to say, I subdued the villain and followed the Count's strictest rule: Never feed to excess--except on a villain."
"219317028-0-1221";"Now where was I? Oh, yes. The villain. I dispatched the cultist with relative ease and had a quick bite. (Fighting makes me peckish.) Unfortunately, my actions seemed to upset the captive young man, who recoiled from me. I must admit, I was expecting him to be a bit more grateful to me for rescuing him. Perhaps if I remove his bindings …."
"219317028-0-1222";"I guess the old saying is true. Never eat on a first date. The captive I rescued from the cultist is the son of a lesser noble house. Lyam Fontbonne is tall, with dark eyes and a tuft of dark hair. He's also rude and ungrateful. And he had the audacity to call me a monster! If he thinks we're going to have a second date, he's probably mistaken!"
"219317028-0-1223";"It took some doing, but I was able to calm Lyam down. I convinced him that his eyes were playing tricks on him. The stress of almost being sacrificed to a Daedric Prince and all. Of course I didn't bite the cultist! And I never sucked the blood from his neck! Now that that's behind us, I wonder if he has an escort for the High King's ball?"
"219317028-0-1224";"What a wonderful evening! Lyam and I talked for hours on the walk back to Shornhelm. He really is quite charming when he isn't being sacrificed to Daedric Princes. He still seems a little shy around me, and I think I make him nervous, but I'm sure he's going to invite me to attend the High King's ball! Your latest components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1225";"Oh, patron! What did I do wrong? It's been two days and I haven't heard a word from Lyam Fontbonne since we said good night on the steps of his family's home in Shornhelm. I saved him from Scamps! We shared a moment! And now, nothing! I must be a terrible person! But never fear, I haven't shirked my duty. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1226";"Oh happy day! A messenger arrived at the castle today. He brought a letter from Lyam. He apologized for the delay and wants to see me! What should I wear? I need to find Gwendis! She's so much better at these sorts of things. I promise to tell you all about my meeting with Lyam. Next time."
"219317028-0-1227";"Gwendis is amazing. She was so helpful! She advised me all about what dress to wear, how to set my hair, all sorts of things to make my meeting with Lyam unfold as smoothly as possible. He still seemed nervous and a little shy, but he did eventually ask me to attend the High King's ball. I, of course, told him I'd think about it and let him know."
"219317028-0-1228";"Gwendis volunteered to respond to Lyam's invitation to accompany him to the High King's ball for me. She's such a good friend! She let him know that I would be both honored and delighted to attend the ball as his companion for the evening. Now all I have to do is wait patiently for the night of the ball. Arrgh! I don't do patiently very well."
"219317028-0-1229";"While waiting for the High King's ball, I decided I needed a distraction. A short trip into the wilds of Rivenspire to search out new components seemed like a good idea. I hadn't poked around the ruins of the Lorkrata Hills for a while, so that was as good a destination as any. I was immediately successful, as you can see from this shipment."
"219317028-0-1230";"I'm not as alone out here as I had thought. I know someone is watching me. The question is, is this mysterious observer benign or dangerous? Well, either way, they are about to discover that Lady Melina Cassel can be deadly when the need arises. In the meantime, enjoy these components."
"219317028-0-1231";"I slipped into the shadows and moved through the ruins, keeping to the darkness. I was certain that I was nearly invisible to my mysterious observer. In that way, I was able to approach his hiding spot without him noticing. He was so focused on scanning the ruins that he never suspected I was now right behind him. It was time to play with my prey."
"219317028-0-1232";"Interesting. The man who had been watching me in the Lorkrata ruins wasn't as clueless as I suspected. He was a hulking Nord who wore the armor of a Resolute of Stendarr. He moved as fast as a Wood Elf and was upon me in an instant, his weapon at the ready. I smiled and introduced myself. It was the polite thing to do before I ripped his face off."
"219317028-0-1233";"Have you heard of the Resolutes of Stendarr? They're a holier-than-you group of warriors, intent on hunting down and destroying anything they don't understand. The Resolute I met in Lorkrata called himself Jakothon Sacred-Oath. He was everything you think of and more when you hear the words ""religious Nord."" And, yes, he was here to kill me."
"219317028-0-1234";"Why does a Resolute of Stendarr want to kill Lady Melina Cassel? Well, that is the question. It was the first thing I asked him after he made his intentions known. ""Because you are a foul, unholy, ugly creature,"" Jakothon replied. ""Because you are a vampire!"" What an ill-mannered brute! I am in no way ugly! As for vampire, well, he had me there."
"219317028-0-1235";"Does my true nature surprise you, patron? Does it disgust you? Fill you belly with terror and your bowels with dread? Really? If so, I'm disappointed in you. After all, I've served you faithfully and honored our agreement to the letter. I'm not a monster. Count Verandis says we're special. That we have a duty to those who don't possess our gifts."
"219317028-0-1236";"I'm not sure how it would have turned out, but Jakothon and I did not fight that day. While we were in the midst of exchanging harsh words and harsher insults, a pack of mindless bloodfiends emerged from the darkness behind the Resolute and fell upon him with savage gusto. With a sigh and despite our differences, I decided to save the Resolute."
"219317028-0-1237";"I must say, Jakothon Sacred-Oath certainly knows how to dispatch bloodfiends. Once I intervened and gave him a chance to get his bearings, he took down the rest of the bloodfiends with only a modicum of help from me. He didn't thank me. He didn't decide to be my friend. All he said was, ""I'll be watching,"" and he turned and walked away."
"219317028-0-1238";"Since I'm still employed, I'll assume that my being a vampire doesn't concern you--at least not enough to stop receiving enchanting components from me. If you're interested, I'll tell you more about life in House Ravenwatch and how we use our special gifts. For now, please accept these materials as a sort of thank you for your ... understanding."
"219317028-0-1239";"It's me again, Melina Cassel. I'm an enchanter-in-training, a supplier of enchanting materials, and one thing more. I'm a vampire. I live by the same code as all members of House Ravenwatch, a code put in place and enforced by Count Verandis. Our primary goal is to do good works, to use our special gifts to help in any way we can."
"219317028-0-1240";"The rest of our code involves such high concepts as honor and vigilance, noble spirit and restraint. We only feed from willing volunteers, and never to excess. The only exception to that rule is when we encounter criminals and evil cultists. In those cases, we can give the monsters within us full rein. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1241";"Now that you know the particulars of my unique existence, let's get back to the more mundane aspects of my life. The night of the High King's ball is fast approaching, and I have a list of preparations as long as my arm to deal with. That means I need assistance. That means I need Gwendis! She really is an expert at these kinds of affairs."
"219317028-0-1242";"The High King's ball is almost upon us and I still have a hundred-and-one tasks to do. I have to have my hair set and my make-up done. And I need a gown. And a bouquet of the most beautiful flowers in the land. Gwendis says she's working on everything, but I'm starting to become nervous. I want to make a good impression when Lyam comes to call."
"219317028-0-1243";"Gwendis did it again! She brought six women into the castle and four hours later my hair is perfect, my make-up is exquisite, my gown is gorgeous, and I feel beautiful! Now all I have to do is not move for the next six hours until Lyam arrives to take me to the ball. But I haven't shirked my responsibilities, patron! Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1244";"Be still my beating heart! Lyam arrived at our door and he looked simply smashing! (And, yes, contrary to popular belief, our hearts beat quite well, thank you.) How handsome the scion of the Fontbonne family looked in his finery! And, I'm pleased to say, he seemed as impressed by my appearance as I was by his. He took my hand and we were off."
"219317028-0-1245";"Have you ever attended the High King's ball, patron? What a marvelous production! The music, the food, the entertainers! We danced the night away and enjoyed each other's company. My only regret is that the party eventually came to an end. That's the trouble with the night. It never lasts as long as you want it to. Use these new materials wisely."
"219317028-0-1246";"Dawn approached as Lyam walked me to the doors of Castle Ravenwatch. I could sense Gwendis watching from the shadows, but she never revealed herself. Lyam told me how much he enjoyed the evening. We kissed. I wanted it to go on forever. But the sun was rising. Reluctantly, we parted. Now I'm happy and sad at the same time. Isn't that strange?"
"219317028-0-1247";"Do you think it's too soon to see Lyam again? Would it be too forward of me to call upon him? To throw myself upon him and ravish him with sweet kisses? I feel like a school-girl and it feels wonderful! Gwendis claims all the credit, but I think my wit, charm, and beauty had something to do with Lyam's reaction.  But here are more components."
"219317028-0-1248";"I couldn't stand being cooped up in the castle for another moment, so I grabbed my pack and headed out to acquire more enchanting components for my clients. It was either that or go mad waiting for word to arrive from Lyam. His silence can be infuriating at times! Not a note since the ball! But my work provides a distraction--for the most part."
"219317028-0-1249";"A few days away from the castle and worrying about Lyam Fontbonne has done me a world of good. I even got to perform a community service (as the Ravenwatch code commands of us) when I saved a couple of travelers from bandits along the road to Shornhelm. I'm heading home now. And there better be something from Lyam waiting for me when I get there!"
"219317028-0-1250";"Oh joyous day! There was something from Lyam waiting when I returned to the castle. He filled our great hall with the most beautiful flowers I have ever seen! It was like all the colors of the rainbow exploded inside the castle. I guess I did make an impression! But where is everyone? Why is the castle empty? What happened while I was gone?"
"219317028-0-1251";"Other than the flowers from Lyam, Castle Ravenwatch is deserted. Gwendis, Adusa, even the servants have disappeared without leaving so much as a note to tell me where they've gone to. I was especially happy when I arrived to find the flowers, but now I'm concerned about my friends and family. I'm growing irritated with these reversals of emotions."
"219317028-0-1252";"I'm alone in the castle. Gwendis and Adusa are missing. The servants are gone. Even fair Estelle, who usually offers me my evening meal, is nowhere to be found. I'm hungry! And I'm worried about the household, as well. Why couldn't I have one day to revel in Lyam's loving gesture? Your materials are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1253";"Still no word from Gwendis or Adusa. Not even a message from any of our servants. I should be basking in the scent of the beautiful flowers that Lyam sent me after the ball, but instead I'm pacing back and forth and imagining all kinds of horrible fates that may have befallen my family. Well, the time to wait is over. I need to do something!"
"219317028-0-1254";"I took another look around the castle before striking out blindly and I discovered something disturbing hiding behind one of the baskets of flowers. It was a brief note from the Resolute of Stendarr. ""Your prisoners shall be free,"" the note said. It was signed ""Jakothon Sacred-Oath."" The fool! Those are our household servants, not our prisoners!"
"219317028-0-1255";"I need to reach Jakothon and the servants before Gwendis and Adusa find them, otherwise House Ravenwatch might well wind up at war with the Resolutes of Stendarr. I really don't need this trouble right now, patron. Things were going so well before that Nord started following me around. Oh, and enjoy the new materials I've enclosed."
"219317028-0-1256";"If I were a hulking Nord who thought all vampires were fiends and practiced a religion of intolerance and piety, where would I hide? The cathedral in Shornhelm? A Stendarr shrine in the wilderness? Maybe in a cave rumored to be haunted by evil spirits that's actually home to a pack of domesticated wolves? How should I know? I'm not a Nord!"
"219317028-0-1257";"I decided to take a chance and check out some of the caves near Castle Ravenwatch to see if Jakothon was using any of them as a lair. I must say, the hunger pangs are beginning to cloud my judgment, but I won't let a skipped meal or three get the better of me. I just hope I find him and the servants before Adusa does."
"219317028-0-1258";"Have I told you about Adusa-daro? She's the bravest Khajiit I know, always undertaking missions for House Ravenwatch. If she was around when Resolute Jakothon took our servants captive, she would have torn the hulking Nord's arms from their sockets. Since there weren't any extra limbs lying around, I assume she was away when Jakothon came by."
"219317028-0-1259";"I was about to charge into the third cave in the hills around Castle Ravenwatch when Gwendis emerged from the shadows and stopped me. ""There's a Resolute of Stendarr in there,"" she hissed quietly. ""I know,"" I whispered back, ""Jakothon Sacred-Oath."" Gwendis quickly explained that she and Adusa were away when the Resolute ""freed"" our servants."
"219317028-0-1260";"""We should wait for Adusa to return,"" Gwendis cautioned as we watched the cave where the Resolute had taken refuge. I refused. Not only was I hungry, I was angry that Jakothon thought our beloved servants were prisoners in our castle. And his solution was to make our servants prisoners in his cave? I couldn't allow this situation to continue."
"219317028-0-1261";"Gwendis reluctantly agreed to wait as I approached Jakothon's cave. The Resolute emerged, his mighty warhammer held firmly in hand. ""I just want to talk,"" I told him. He said he had freed my prisoners. ""Did they tell you they were captives?"" I asked. ""We pay them, house them, treat them like part of the family. They're your captives, not ours."""
"219317028-0-1262";"""You've taken our household servants captive, Jakothon, and I've come to set them free,"" I said to the Resolute of Stendarr who considered me nothing more than a monster. At least, I thought he did. He gave out a tremendous sigh and lowered his weapon. ""Your servants have been very cross with me, my lady. I apologize for my actions this day."""
"219317028-0-1263";"I couldn't believe my ears! The Resolute actually apologized. To me! Jakothon said he had never encountered monsters such as the Ravenwatches before and didn't know how to deal with us. ""Your servants have spoken very highly of you and your house,"" he added. ""I don't understand it, but it seems I was wrong about you."""
"219317028-0-1264";"Gwendis led the servants back to the castle. I was about to follow when Jakothon cleared his throat. ""My lady,"" he began hesitantly, ""if it's all right with you, I'd like to call upon you in the future. In an un-professional capacity, of course."" I do believe the Resolute wants to court me! My life just gets more interesting every day."
"219317028-0-1265";"I was hungry. I was tired. So I did the only reasonable thing I could think of when a Nord who's also a Resolute of Stendarr asked if he could call upon me sometime. I said I'd be delighted. I felt guilty a moment later, but it's not like Lyam has asked for my hand in marriage or anything. I kissed Jakothon on the cheek and ran back to the castle."
"219317028-0-1266";"Dear patron, how are things in your part of the world? Things here at Castle Ravenwatch have returned to normal. The servants are safe and we're feeding regularly again. Adusa has returned from another one of her secret missions. And I'm back to practicing my enchanting. And collecting components. Here are some materials for you."
"219317028-0-1267";"Lady Melina Cassel, at your service! I've undertaken another trip to enhance my skills and gather components for my clients. This time I'm traveling to Sentinel, deep in the heart of Alik'r, to study with the fabled enchanter, Veroine Gimbert. I met her once in Daggerfall, and she indicated that she remembered me. I wonder what she can teach me?"
"219317028-0-1268";"I'm writing from on board the High King's Gold, a worthy sea vessel, on my way to the city of Sentinel. My servant Estelle accompanies me, providing company and sustenance as necessary on this long journey. I can't wait to study with Veroine Gimbert. I understand she can do things with runes and glyphs that I've never even dreamed about!"
"219317028-0-1269";"Dear patron, it seems we're under attack! The High King's Gold is a superior sailing ship, but there are three vessels flying pirate flags bearing down on us. I can see the ballistae pointing in our direction. I've never participated in a naval battle, but I would have hoped for more even odds for my first such experience."
"219317028-0-1270";"I feel helpless as the ballistae bolts crash into the sea around us and arcane fire flies from the fingers of mages on both sides. I guess if one of the enemy vessels gets close enough, I can employ my unique gifts against them. In the meantime, all I can do is stand back and watch what happens. With luck, these components will still reach you."
"219317028-0-1271";"It appears that the pirate vessels would rather capture our ship than sink it. One of their vessels has pulled up alongside us and has begun the boarding process. I hate to reveal my true nature in such a public fashion, especially this far at sea, but I see no other option. I won't allow the pirates to gain control of the High King's Gold."
"219317028-0-1272";"As I prepared to get all unladylike on the enemy attempting to board our vessel, a fleet of Daggerfall warships emerged from the fog to our west and sailed toward us. For a moment, I thought the pirates were going to stay and fight, but then we heard the shouted orders. ""Disengage!"" someone commanded. ""Fall back!"" shouted another."
"219317028-0-1273";"The pirate ships sailed off, most likely disappointed that the treasures of the High King's Gold wasn't going to fall into their hands this day. Truth be told, I was disappointed as well. I was actually looking forward to bashing a few pirate heads together as they tried to board our vessel. Oh, well. On to Sentinel. New materials included."
"219317028-0-1274";"Sentinel is a desert jewel on the western shores of Alik'r. The spires and domes of the city are a welcome sight as the High King's Gold approaches the harbor. Even Estelle seems thrilled about exploring a new location, and she's still recovering from the excitement of the sea journey and the pirate battle. I hope Veroine is ready for us."
"219317028-0-1275";"Veroine Gimbert is amazing! First, she recognized me for what I am the instant I stepped into her shop. Second, she accepted my condition and then moved onto the reason I had traveled all this way. She started to teach me enchanting techniques I had never been exposed to before. We spent hours as teacher and student. What a great experience!"
"219317028-0-1276";"Patron, it's me again, Melina Cassel. This newest shipment contains components I collected while in the company of the famed enchanter, Veroine Gimbert. She's taught me so much in the time I've been here! But, alas, all good things must come to an end. I've booked passage on a ship heading for Northpoint and we sail on the morrow."
"219317028-0-1277";"Estelle and I have booked passage on the Broken Fin and should be back in Rivenspire in a few days. I plan to use the relative quiet of the sea voyage to review my notes and commit all of Veroine's lessons to memory. Unless the pirates attack us again. Then I plan to reveal my darker side to the rabble in the most direct manner possible."
"219317028-0-1278";"Alas, patron, our return voyage was uneventful. Not a sign of a pirate, not a storm cloud in the sky. Not even an angry wave to rock the ship as it sliced through the water. I admit it, I was a little disappointed. And bored. I was so very, very bored. But we're home again. I'm sure something exciting is happening around Castle Ravenwatch."
"219317028-0-1279";"I was wrong. Nothing interesting is happening at Castle Ravenwatch either. Perhaps I've had all the adventures that were allotted to me. Perhaps I've experienced all of the excitement that I was entitled to. Perhaps the rest of my days will be filled with sadness and regret as boredom overcomes me. Your newest materials are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1280";"Oh, patron, my days are so ... similar! I awaken. I draw sustenance from a servant. I practice enchantments. I collect components. I ship them off. Then I do the same thing all over again! You must think me an ungrateful debutante, living a life of luxury in a castle while complaining about minutia. But it's more than that! I feel unfulfilled."
"219317028-0-1281";"It's me. Melina Cassel. The whining brat who wishes for excitement and adventure. You must find me dreadful! I wish it weren't so, but it's how I feel. And there doesn't seem to be anything I can do to change it. Oh. What's this? A letter! Perhaps it's from Lyam. An invitation to another ball? That would be spectacular! But it has a strange seal."
"219317028-0-1282";"Remember that strange seal on the mysterious letter I received? Turns out it was the mark of the Resolutes of Stendarr, pressed into a circle of silvery wax. Was it a letter from Jakothon Sacred-Oath? I never did find out how a Nord wound up as a Resolute. Perhaps I'll ask him the next time I see him--provided he isn't trying to kill me."
"219317028-0-1283";"Wait a moment. Didn't Jakothon ask if he could call upon me? Yes, I believe he did. Is that what's in this sealed envelope? An invitation from a Resolute of Stendarr requesting a romantic meeting with a vampire? Well, I was hoping for some excitement. I guess I won't know for sure until I read the letter. In the meantime, here are your materials."
"219317028-0-1284";"The seal seemed to spark with arcane light as I broke it and drew forth the folded parchment. It was indeed a letter from Jakothon, but the Resolute wasn't seeking a romantic rendezvous. He apparently needs my help. He requests that I meet him outside the Crestshade Mine at an hour past sundown tomorrow evening. Whatever shall I wear?"
"219317028-0-1285";"I decided to accept Jakothon's invitation and meet him at the Crestshade Mine. He was rather vague about the type of help he required, so I decided to dress for battle. Just in case. There's nothing like an adventure to clear away the cobwebs of boredom! Perhaps I should reconsider my career choice. Maybe the adventurer's life is more to my taste."
"219317028-0-1286";"I'm here, outside the Crestshade Mine, and there's no sign of Jakothon the Resolute. I'd say it isn't like him to be late, but I really don't know the man very well. Wouldn't you imagine that someone who calls himself a Resolute would be punctual? You see my point. I'll wait a bit longer. Just to be polite. Here are more materials for your use."
"219317028-0-1287";"A tall, gaunt man in flowing robes emerged from the mine and approached me. ""You must be Lady Melina Cassel of House Ravenwatch,"" he said with a smooth yet cheerless smile. ""Allow me to introduce myself. I am Mazular al-Abec, and I am in need of an enchanter."" If this rings alarm bells for you, patron, Imagine the noise resounding in my head!"
"219317028-0-1288";"So Mazular al-Abec needs an enchanter. That explained a lot but told me nothing. Where was Jakothon Sacred-Oath? Had he called me here to help Mazular or is there something more sinister going on here? I had to bide my time until I had more information, so I summoned up my most charming smile and asked, ""So what can I do for you, good sir?"""
"219317028-0-1289";"Mazular al-Abec asked me if I had ever heard of the theoretical quartonic runestone. ""The Celerity runestone?"" I blurted out. ""Ah, so you do know it,"" Mazular said. ""Then perhaps you can help me extract the rune from its housing."" I imagine at this point you might be confused, patron, as I don't know the extent of your enchanting training."
"219317028-0-1290";"Camilonwe of Lillandril asserted that it was impossible for there to be only three types of runestones. He theorized the existence of a quartonic runestone, which he named the Celerity rune. He spent the last two hundred years of his life searching for Celerity, but he never found it. Could this Mazular al-Abec really have discovered one?"
"219317028-0-1291";"I agreed to help Mazular, provided he let me talk to Jakothon Sacred-Oath. ""The Resolute of Stendarr?"" he laughed. ""Do you know that the fool actually tried to kill me?"" That was a troubling revelation. It meant that Mazular was a vampire, werewolf, or other creature that preyed on mortals. And probably not a benevolent one. Not like me."
"219317028-0-1292";"Mazular had his followers bring Jakothon out so I could see him. He had been beaten, and he was bound up and blindfolded, but he appeared to be mostly intact. When he sensed my proximity, Jakothon called out, ""Don't trust the Redguard, my lady!"" This earned the Resolute another strike across the head. ""I'll help you, Mazular,"" I proclaimed."
"219317028-0-1293";"It's a wise person who knows when to cooperate. Either that, or a weak one. But I couldn't bring myself to see Jakothon hurt any further by Mazular and his thugs. I had no idea who this Redguard was or why he contacted me, but I knew I was the only one who could save Jakothon. I just had to successfully extract a theoretical rune from its housing."
"219317028-0-1294";"Mazular directed me to a wagon and pulled away the tarp that covered it, revealing a mound of fresh earth. In the mound was a runestone, a rune still embedded within its oddly shaped surface. ""Free the Celerity rune from its housing and you and the Resolute can go free,"" Mazular said. ""After you create a specific glyph for me, of course."""
"219317028-0-1295";"I studied the strange runestone for a few long moments. I didn't know if this was the legendary Celerity rune, but it certainly wasn't any of the usual Potency, Aspect, and Essence runes I normally deal in. I didn't know what purpose Mazular had for the rune, but I sensed that if I let him obtain it terrible things would occur."
"219317028-0-1296";"Here are some new components, patron. Now let me tell you what happened with Mazular and the strange runestone. I took out my rune extracting tools and prepared to begin working on the stone. At least, I hoped that's what it looked like. I only had one chance at this, and all would be lost if Mazular realized what I was actually planning to do."
"219317028-0-1297";"Instead of carefully placing the tip of my blade at the corner of the exposed rune, I drove the blade into the center of the stone with all my vampiric might. The stone cracked with a surprisingly sharp sound, immediately alerting Mazular to my treachery. Jakothon tried to break his bonds as Mazular shouted, ""You will die for that, Breton wench!"""
"219317028-0-1298";"As I leapt back and prepared to defend myself, I watched as Mazular began to cast magic--dark magic. Skeletal warriors began to emerge from the ground, ready to do the Redguard's bidding. But do you know what the best thing about being a member of House Ravenwatch is? Help is never far from my side--help in the form of Adusa-daro and Gwendis!"
"219317028-0-1299";"Three vampires trained in the art of war make for devastating opponents, as Mazular al-Abec discovered that night near the Crestshade Mine. It didn't get any easier for him once I freed Jakothon Sacred-Oath and the Resolute of Stendarr joined the battle.  In short order, his followers were dead and his skeletons were scattered bones."
"219317028-0-1300";"Have I ever mentioned how much I hate users of dark magic? They always have a contingency plan for any situation. I guess you realize what that means. Mazular escaped. But at least he didn't get the rune he was seeking--whatever it was. Once again House Ravenwatch has saved the day. It's what we do."
"219317028-0-1301";"Melina Cassel here, once again sending the finest enchanting materials your way. After last night's excitement, I do believe I might take a short break. A vacation of sorts. Jakothon has invited me to see the sights of Skyrim, and I think I'll accept his kind offer. But never fear. Enchanting components will continue to find their way to you."

"219317028-0-1443";"Greetings. This one is called Zukki-dar, or simply ""Zukki."" He is a Baandari Trader by profession. Zukki knows little of what he is selling, save that he is charging a great deal too much for it, but as he travels the land he will look for items that might be of interest to you."
"219317028-0-1444";"Zukki travels with a caravan of other Khajiit. We are all from Senchal on the Quin'rawl Peninsula of Elsweyr. We have many young ones, and we take them everywhere. Zukki has no idea how they find their way back. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1445";"These young Khajiit are so full of lies and bad manners. Zukki would turn them away if they didn't grow up to be such good salesman. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1446";"Zukki is training a young Khajiit named Tavah. That one would sell you something, steal it back, then sell it to you again. It is not only dishonest, it is highly profitable.  Zukki admires that."
"219317028-0-1447";"Here is your delivery. It is this one's turn to cook for the caravan. Zukki enjoys cooking with moon sugar. Sometimes he even adds it to the food."
"219317028-0-1448";"Tavah's training continues. Today's lesson is to start the day off with a smile. That way it is over and done with. Tavah learns quickly."
"219317028-0-1449";"Many Khajiit distrust the other races. This is bad business. Zukki has no prejudice. He dislikes everyone, equally. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-1450";"This one is growing tired of the young ones.  Kittens are rude and disrespectful, and they are always threatening to run away. This is the only thing that keeps Zukki going."
"219317028-0-1451";"Today the caravan passed a group of fat mercenaries, huffing and puffing their way down the road. They claimed to be ""separatists."" This one thinks they should try separating themselves from their sweetrolls."
"219317028-0-1452";"You may have noticed by now that sarcasm is only one of the many services that Zukki offers. He also specializes in mockery and open derision."
"219317028-0-1453";"Zukki recently noticed that some Argonians are easily irritated and inclined to resent it if you poke them with a stick. He also discovered that you can find out which ones by poking them with a stick."
"219317028-0-1454";"This one believes he has determined the proper number of times you can ask someone to repeat themselves before simply nodding and pretending you understood. Three."
"219317028-0-1455";"It recently occurred to Zukki that his sarcasm is so advanced that stupid people think he is stupid, as well. Consequently, he has been inadvertently making a lot of friends. He hates them all, but he has no idea how to show it."
"219317028-0-1456";"If these Khajiit do not wish to hear a snarky reply, why do they keep asking Zukki stupid questions? Here are your components."
"219317028-0-1457";"It is Zukki. Do you remember him? Oh, wait. This one forgot that he only exists in your world when you need something from him. Take your delivery and choke on it."
"219317028-0-1458";"Forgive Zukki's last outburst. He ran out of wine, which is vital to maintaining his ability to suffer the idiots who surround him. He has corrected this shortfall, and he is currently in the planning stages of a monumental hangover. In the meanwhile, here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1459";"This one can be annoyingly acerbic at times. He knows it is a character flaw. However, Zukki recently noticed that his caustic demeanor unintentionally frightens small children, so it may not be entirely without merit."
"219317028-0-1460";"Here is your delivery. It is always such a pleasure for Zukki to serve you. (For future reference, since it is so difficult to infer tone in a written correspondence, you should just assume that Zukki's are all dripping with sarcasm.)"
"219317028-0-1461";"This one is loathe to admit it, but as an employer, you are actually beginning to grow on him. Zukki wishes you could travel with him occasionally so we could hate the same people."
"219317028-0-1462";"Zukki has decided that the reason he hates all people is because he considers himself to be the best of them, and he know precisely how bad he is. Your delivery is attached."
"219317028-0-1463";"Zukki's philosophy of life is to screw unto others before they screw unto you. In accordance, today's delivery contains stolen goods. (Trust Zukki. They did not deserve them.)"
"219317028-0-1464";"If Zukki were ever to marry, he would marry a female who loves the outdoors. This way, if Zukki decided to lock her out for the night she would still survive. This one is not without compassion."
"219317028-0-1465";"The caravan spent the night in the city, which is always a chore. This one never underestimates the power of idiots, especially when they gather in large groups. Your components are enclosed."
"219317028-0-1466";"Zukki is no bigot, but he thinks Argonians are the most pernicious race of odious vermin that the Divines ever suffered to crawl upon the face of Nirn. But to their great credit, at least they aren't Nords."
"219317028-0-1467";"It occurs to Zukki that you might think him ungrateful for his continued employment, based upon the pessimistic tone of his letters. He will attempt, in the future, to be more optimistic. Forgive him in advance for his almost certain failure in this endeavor. Zukki feels certain he will make a terrible optimist."
"219317028-0-1468";"This one does not enjoy traveling with a caravan, but at least it affords him some protection along the road. Our guards are fairly competent, and might even dispatch an enemy, provided their weapons are pointed just so and the enemy falls upon them in just the right way."
"219317028-0-1469";"The caravan was attacked, but Zukki escaped with minor bruises. It would have been a poor death, anyway. Surely the Divines have something prepared for Zukki on a larger scale. Something with manacles, sharp blades, and a few hundred cheering spectators."
"219317028-0-1470";"This one really isn't a curmudgeon. He can be very charming if people would just do what he asks of them. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1471";"Between people trying to cheat him and people trying to accost him, Zukki feels certain that he has become Nirn's principle means of employment. The entire economy of Tamriel appears to be based on ruining Zukki's day. And that is on a good day."
"219317028-0-1472";"Much as he has tried, this one simply cannot be optimistic about anything. But then, Zukki does not recall anything in his job description about being willing to poop sunshine on demand, so you will just have to deal with it.  Also, this one is out of wine again."
"219317028-0-1473";"Why is it that people seem to take such pleasure at feeling superior to others? Zukki is glad he is not one of them. He is far better than that. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1474";"This one enjoys long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy him. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1475";"Zukki does not know why he works so hard to make others dislike him. It happens quite naturally without all that effort."
"219317028-0-1476";"Zukki is drinking and musing on the nature of morality, while the tavern keeper naps. What is just, Zukki wonders, and what is dishonest? Perhaps the distinction lies in what is right, and what one can rationalize. Wine puts Zukki in a better mood, therefore they won't miss a bottle or two."
"219317028-0-1477";"This one is people-watching in the city. This one has noticed that there are two kinds of people in this world. Zukki doesn't like either of them."
"219317028-0-1478";"There is a stray dog following the caravan, and it fascinates Zukki. One can learn many things from a dog, including loyalty and perseverance. Also the importance of turning around three times before lying down."
"219317028-0-1479";"Zukki has been feeding the dog and growing quite attached to it. It never talks about itself, and when Zukki talks about himself, the dog always looks interested. Also, it growls at the young ones and makes them cry."
"219317028-0-1480";"The dog does not leave this one's side now, which is convenient should the need arise for him to bark violently for no reason, right in Zukki's ear."
"219317028-0-1481";"A Khajiit spends a lot of time on personal grooming. Dogs do not. This dog's idea of personal grooming is to roll in a pile of rotten fish. The dog is also very shaggy and unkempt. This one is surprised how often the dog gets up and Zukki realizes he has been speaking to the wrong end."
"219317028-0-1482";"The dog left Zukki and ran off with a necromancer, presumably for the bones. Zukki is sad at this development, but he should have known better than to trust an animal that is surprised by its own farts."
"219317028-0-1483";"Zukki is another year older today. He may not move as fast as he used to, but he cannot regret getting older. It is a privilege denied to many."
"219317028-0-1484";"Being a year older has gotten Zukki to thinking about retiring from the hard life of the road. The trouble is, he has no other useful skills or talents. Perhaps he could go into teaching?"
"219317028-0-1485";"This one hates growing old. Zukki's whiskers are white and his bones are weary. He is getting so old he is afraid to buy green bananas. Why does old age come at such a bad time?"
"219317028-0-1486";"Did this one already mention that he does not like children? They are loud and sticky. But Zukki has learned many things from them, like how much patience he does not have."
"219317028-0-1487";"This one has never married. He recently heard that married people live longer, but Zukki doesn't believe that. He thinks it probably just seems longer."
"219317028-0-1488";"Zukki has decided that the reason he uses sarcasm so much is because it keeps him from telling people what he really thinks about them."
"219317028-0-1489";"This one lives every day as if it was his last, because one day he will be right. But Zukki is ready to meet his makers. Whether his makers are prepared to meet him is quite another matter."
"219317028-0-1490";"Zukki wonders about the future. What does it hold for him? Where will it take him? He thinks perhaps the future will be just like the present, only more expensive."
"219317028-0-1491";"Has Zukki told you about his brother Yakku, who was borish and spent his youth bullying Zukki? Word has come that Yakku passed away. He was involved in a tragic fishing accident. Zukki did not attend the burial, but he sent a nice letter saying that he approved."
"219317028-0-1492";"The caravan leader keeps a box for lost and found items. Yesterday the box went missing, so Zukki is being very careful not to lose anything until it is found."
"219317028-0-1493";"Zukki meets many Nords in his travels. They may look like idiots and talk like idiots, but do not let this deceive you. They really are idiots."
"219317028-0-1494";"Have I mentioned the Khajiit named Naamah? She travels with the caravan. She is very popular with all the young males, and she knows this. Every night she visits a different bedroll. One might say that she climbed the ladder of popularity wrong by wrong."
"219317028-0-1495";"The female called Naamah continues to annoy this one to no end. This is probably because she lacks the power of conversation, but not the power of speech. Every time she opens her mouth, Zukki gets a fierce desire to be lonesome."
"219317028-0-1496";"Zukki will never understand humans. They work hard to earn gold, and then spend it on things they don't want, to impress people they don't like. How does this make sense?"
"219317028-0-1497";"Another bandit attack on the road. Zukki believes that there are two kinds of people in this world: those who draw steel and stand up for themselves and those who run for the bushes. Bushes are better. They also offer shade."
"219317028-0-1498";"Why are these Altmer so serious? They never smile or laugh. If they find it so hard to laugh at themselves, Zukki would be pleased to do it for them."
"219317028-0-1499";"Zukki has had a very satisfying and productive day. Unfortunately, this was not it. Nonetheless, he has enclosed your delivery."
"219317028-0-1500";"This one is pleased to say that he has no enemies, but he will admit that he is intensely disliked by his friends."
"219317028-0-1501";"When Zukki was a kitten he used to pray for candy. Then he realized that the Divines do not work that way, so he stole some candy and prayed for forgiveness. This one is very good with finding loopholes."
"219317028-0-1502";"There is so much crime and wrongdoings in these lands. This frustrates Zukki. He wishes either that there were less wrongdoings, or that he had more of a chance to profit from them."
"219317028-0-1503";"This one does not like politics, nor does he trust politicians. When he was a kitten, he was told that anyone could become Emperor. He is beginning to believe it."
"219317028-0-1504";"Zukki is used to bad luck and hard times. A seer once told him that he will have a sad life and a sad death. This was very useful because he knew to lower his expectations. Also, Zukki appreciates symmetry."
"219317028-0-1505";"This one has heard it said that ignorance is bliss. Orcs must be the happiest people in the Mundus."
"219317028-0-1506";"Zukki is trying to be healthier. He is eating leaner meats, exercising more, and he has cut down on the wine and the moon sugar. Already, in just fourteen days, he has lost two weeks."
"219317028-0-1507";"This one never believed in luck, but recently he has been reconsidering. Zukki has no other way to explain the continued success of the idiots who surround him."
"219317028-0-1508";"Namah invited Zukki to a party in the city. He agreed to go, but he is not looking forward to it. What is the point? Surely not for Zukki to enjoy himself. If that were the purpose, the host could have sent wine and moon sugar to Zukki's camp by wagon and saved him the long walk."
"219317028-0-1509";"Zukki is writing from the party. It is a most boring affair. When this one is the most interesting person in the room, it is time to leave. But, Zukki's wine glass keeps being refilled by a serving girl, so he has decided to see how intoxicated he can get and how many people he can mock."
"219317028-0-1510";"Namah ran off with a Nord she met at the party. He was very impressive. Seldom has Zukki ever experienced such a small mind in such an enormous head."
"219317028-0-1511";"Zukki has decided that parties are just sad excuses for idiots to drink excessively and rub against each other in the hopes of distracting themselves from the meaningless emptiness of their pathetic lives. This one is shocked. All this time, he thought they were without value!"
"219317028-0-1512";"On the road there are good days, and bad days. This means that some days Zukki will be cranky, and on other days he will be really cranky. Today he is really cranky."
"219317028-0-1513";"Zukki finally got some sleep last night, but he had a dream that he had insomnia. When he woke up he was exhausted, but far too well-rested to go back to sleep."
"219317028-0-1514";"Zukki may be old, but he is not senile. If he burns the whole caravan down it will be on purpose, but he will be sure to send your delivery first."
"219317028-0-1515";"There is a good side to being as old as Zukki. People tend to treat you like an idiot, so you can get away with acting like one from time to time. It breaks up the day."
"219317028-0-1516";"This one has gained weight, and has been drinking too much. Also, his back hurts. If Zukki knew he was going to live this long he would have taken better care of himself."
"219317028-0-1517";"It was Zukki's turn to do the dishes tonight. He didn't do a very good job. This one realized a long time ago that if he does a job badly enough, sometimes he doesn't get asked to do it again."
"219317028-0-1518";"Sikka is one of the caravan guards, and he is always bossing Zukki around like he is the smartest Khajiit in the Mundus. A Khajiit who thinks he knows it all is especially annoying to those of us that do."
"219317028-0-1519";"This one is still angry at his beautiful young Khajiit mistress for not existing. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-1520";"The caravan met up with a troupe of traveling circus performers, but they turned out to be criminals who tried to rob us and we had to fight them off. Zukki did very well because he thought quickly. He went right for the juggler."
"219317028-0-1521";"Your delivery is enclosed. Did I mention the female called Namah grew tired of the Nord she ran off with? She has returned to the caravan, but she still wants nothing to do with Zukki. She says that Zukki is too condescending. Isn't that adorable?"
"219317028-0-1522";"Why is it that every time Zukki opens his mouth, some idiot starts making speeches? Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1523";"This one thinks that Khajiit females should stop having kittens at forty, because Dark Moons! That is a lot of kittens!"
"219317028-0-1524";"Namah says I should eat healthier foods. Why would I do that? Even the healthiest Khajiit is just dying the slowest. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1525";"Namah is infuriating. Zukki hates it when she asks him to drop everything just because he is doing nothing, because he was thinking of doing something and now he forgets what."
"219317028-0-1526";"This one has come to the conclusion that his true purpose in life may simply be to serve as a warning to others. Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-1527";"Zukki found a big jug of strong mead. This one does not know whose jug it is, but he swears he will get to the bottom of it."
"219317028-0-1528";"Why do they put the dye merchant right next to the potion merchant? Zukki just wanted a little extra stamina. This one dyed a little inside."
"219317028-0-1529";"This one met a female minstrel that said she was a harp player, but Zukki noticed she was picking, not plucking. Lyre!"
"219317028-0-1530";"You see the strangest things in the city. Yesterday, Zukki saw a Sorcerer turn into a tavern. This one made a joke. He is not surprised you didn't get it."
"219317028-0-1531";"This one has many irrational fears, but Zukki's greatest fear is that he'll never get over all of his phobias. Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1532";"The caravan met another group of traveling circus performers, but these were not criminals, they were actually somewhat entertaining. But Zukki quickly became bored and his mind wandered. Soon he found himself obsessed with an odd thought. What do circus performers run off to join?"
"219317028-0-1533";"You've made a wise decision, dear. Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods is going to take good care of you in these troubled times. When your other suppliers are coming up short, you can count on old granny to have everything you need."
"219317028-0-1534";"Granny here with a little bundle for her favorite customer. There's a cookie tucked in the parcel in case you get peckish on the road, unless those rapscallion couriers have been helping themselves again. They'll get a stern talking to, be certain."
"219317028-0-1535";"My, my, brigandry certainly is on the rise on the outskirts of Cyrodiil. Granny came across the most beautiful carriage just upturned in a ditch. Had the most beautiful curtains and upholstery. Must have broken some poor dear's heart to have to leave it behind."
"219317028-0-1536";"Now don't let my last message alarm you. Every order from Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods comes with Granny's Guarantee. You'll get your deliveries even if Granny has to hike it out to you herself!"
"219317028-0-1537";"Good news! Granny hears the legion is on the march to give those bandits a good ole sweeping out. You can bet Granny will be right on their heels making sure her customers are getting the best in reclaimed goods every day."
"219317028-0-1538";"The early worm gets the juicy bits, as they say. All the hard work those strapping young legionnaires put in has Granny's business booming again. She'll have to knit them a little thank you during the next slow spell."
"219317028-0-1539";"Granny would like to let you know that she's got a fine surplus of leather sundries she doesn't have room for, so she's taking special orders. Color and suppleness limited by availability."
"219317028-0-1540";"Granny's eyesight isn't so good anymore, so if any of your recent deliveries have suffered from persistent stains she wants to remind you that she's happy to make an exchange or treat the items with her patented spot removal mixtures."
"219317028-0-1541";"Granny is happy to announce the opening of Granny Gravius's Plum Busted Scrap and Salvage. Not everything can meet the exacting standards Granny has for her Gently Used selection, but that don't mean it's no good! All sales final."
"219317028-0-1542";"Granny regrets to inform you that her stock of Gently Used tundra cotton linens are temporarily out of stock, but don't you worry, dear. Granny has received a sizeable selection to her Plum Busted line courtesy of Mr. Piddles."
"219317028-0-1543";"Storm season's a coming to the Gold Coast, so Granny's going to be heading out to check up on her shipping and keep an eye out for new stock. She'll be sending her deliveries same as always though."
"219317028-0-1544";"Greetings from Granny! The road's feeling a bit long to her old bones, but there's adventure and excitement to keep her going. She can't go one day without someone gabbing about some murder or another out here, just like those serials she used to read in her youth!"
"219317028-0-1545";"Contrary to what you might think after Granny's last letter, she got nothing interesting to report. Nobody seems to be able to point Granny to any of these murders and she's beginning to think they're just scuttlebutt! Can't stand busybodies who spread nasty rumors."
"219317028-0-1546";"Hello from Anvil, dear. There's an ache in my knees and the sky's the color of steel, so Granny's arrived just in the nick of time. Sent this off on the last ship braving the sea. Now off to visit the lighthouse keeper. Old friend of Granny's, you know?"
"219317028-0-1547";"Hope you haven't had any delays, dear. Doozy of a storm rolled in since Granny last wrote. Half a dozen ships wrecked trying to make their way to port. Some locals plan to search the coast for survivors, but ole Granny didn't see any."
"219317028-0-1548";"With clearer skies and Granny's stock in order, she'll be heading off from Anvil soon enough. Granny's got to buy a second cart."
"219317028-0-1549";"Off with another package for you and on my own way. Granny's made a new friend for the trip home. A sweet little one-eyed tom she found eating crow along the beach. They're always such a bother, maybe One-Eyed Tom will chase them off for her. He has the nicest purr."
"219317028-0-1550";"You like cats, dear? Ole Granny loves the little darlings, and they're so smart and self-sufficient she can take care of them without much fuss. Sometimes they bring her presents when they're keeping any rodents from nibbling her stock."
"219317028-0-1551";"Granny thinks One-Eyed Tom's going to fit right in with her little darlings, but she's going to have to keep Mr. Piddles outside until she's sure they'll get along or it'll be weeks of shuffling stock into the Plum Busted pile."
"219317028-0-1552";"Just a reminder, Granny Gravious occasionally accepts payment in the form of cat treats. You can address any provisions to Granny or the kitty of your choice. No milk or cheese for Poopsie."
"219317028-0-1553";"With all the new customers Granny's been getting she forgets who knows her little darlings. Mr. Piddles has been meddling in the business lately, but there's Poopsie too, and of course One-Eyed Tom's the newest addition. Oh, let Granny think and get back to you."
"219317028-0-1554";"There's Snaggletooth; Floofty and Scruffy the twins; Mangy Tim, Nubby, Scratchy Pete, Peepers, Danny Drools, Nord the Naked; Hawker, Hocker, and Horker; Mrs. Peaches, Prissy Penny, Hairball, Poopsie ... No, Granny already mentioned Poopsie. Drat! Granny better wait until she gets home."
"219317028-0-1555";"Saw the banners of the Dominion on the march today. Headed to Imperial City, of course, that's where they're always headed. Granny's going to trail behind while the road's clear."
"219317028-0-1556";"It always amazes Granny how dressed up the three armies get to come die in the mud. Silken banners, ornamented saddles and even the gleam of gold. You'd think it a parade!"
"219317028-0-1557";"Big band of those Daggerfall Covenant folk crested a hill within yelling distance of that Dominion group I was telling you about. Could have cut the tension with a knife and buttered your bread with it in the time they spent eyeing each other, but they got to it soon enough. Be following the Covenant for a while now."
"219317028-0-1558";"Found a Dominion boy breathing his last in the aftermath. Poor dear was a blubbering mess. Granny gave up her favorite pillow to ease his passing, but he's quiet now, like a good boy, while Granny works."
"219317028-0-1559";"Granny thinks she paid too much for this extra cart in Anvil, you'd think it about to fall apart the way it's creaking. Granny can see some of those Covenant hooligans throwing her dirty looks, but none of them has the gumption to complain."
"219317028-0-1560";"Why I never, those ill-mannered Covenant have started making mocking calls at poor Granny on the road. ''Caw, Caw!'' ''Caw, Caw!'' The nerve! If they aren't careful One-Eyed Tom is gonna pounce them good."
"219317028-0-1561";"And off they go, darn fools, to Imperial City. Granny'd like to see someone teach them some manners, but she's not going to see them again, she reckons. Just a few years ago Granny could make the trip, but she's not as spry these days."
"219317028-0-1562";"Suffered a recent loss or tragedy? Want to do right by your loved ones, but not sure if you can? Don't let exorbitant interments add to your burdens. Let Granny Gravius's Discount Pyre-Wood make all your worries disappear. Now available by mail or at select temples of Arkay."
"219317028-0-1563";"Oopsie-daisie, Granny didn't mean to send you that flier, she's still working things out with those stubborn clergy about distribution. If you find you should need her Discount Pyre-Wood, Granny can send a special order, but just for you, dear."
"219317028-0-1564";"Oh, Granny shouldn't forget to mention that her wood's good for any sort of burning you might need to do. All genuine reclaimed timber, free of rot, damp, and pests. Any cosmetic blemishes or discolorations you discover won't affect their kindling."
"219317028-0-1565";"Granny nearly forgot, she's been so busy since she got back. Some of her other kitties are Tiny Jane, Scrumples, Scaredy, Percy, Polly, Rusty, Moldy, Splinters, Black-Foot, Sir Rumple-Bottom, Mouse, Mouser. Hmm, Granny's running out of ink. She'll have to tell you about the rest later."
"219317028-0-1566";"Well, it looks like business is taking ole Granny out to Vvardenfell. Not her first time out to that peculiar old island, but it's been a guar's age since she's seen its ashy shores. If Granny finds you a nice souvenir she'll just include it in a future delivery."
"219317028-0-1567";"Greetings from Bravil, dear! Granny's just making final preparations for her trip to Vvardenfell, but she's got a soft spot for this town. She especially likes taking her lunch at the foot of that nice ole statue in the square. It reminds her of all her own little dears."
"219317028-0-1568";"Granny's about to board her ferry out to Morrowind, so she might be out of touch a spell. Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods can keep her deliveries coming on time, so don't fret none about our arrangement."
"219317028-0-1569";"Discerning Customer, this one is pleased to deliver your regular order through Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods. We pray that you are most satisfied with the selection. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1570";"Discerning Customer, you have been randomly selected for a satisfaction survey with your recent order from Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods. A survey will accompany your next order. This one would be eternally grateful for your participation. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1571";"Day 403 of this one's captivity: The wizened one gathers her prisoners with bowls of cream, but Khajiit will not drink. The announcement of another departure offers hope of escape, but this one knows it is a false one. Khajiit consoles himself with cookies, but the cream is gone."
"219317028-0-1572";"Discerning Customer, this one must apologize for any confusion caused by any accompanying correspondence included with your last delivery. A confidential document was packaged instead of your satisfaction survey. This one suggests you dispose of it and not mention this incident in your survey. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1573";"The last time Granny crossed the Niben Bay that nasty Knahatan Flu was starting to creep out of Black Marsh. Granny did the rowing herself back then. Couldn't find a ferrier in a hundred miles willing to ride the river where Granny was hoping to go. Got herself there, you can be sure of that!"
"219317028-0-1574";"Ever ridden a Silt Strider, dear? Granny can't think of a better way to travel. Great view, and the gentle pace isn't too hard on Granny's old bones. Got a doozy taking Granny to the Inner Sea and she thinks this big fella could ford it."
"219317028-0-1575";"The caravaner told Granny he wasn't going to try walking his big bug to Vivec City, so Granny's going to have to hop another ferry. She's a bit forgetful these days, but ole Granny don't remember much city the last time she was there. The big floating rock was nice though."
"219317028-0-1576";"Discerning Customer, please share your responses to the following questions: When thinking of Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods, what are the first five words that come to mind? Have you generally been satisfied with the quality of your orders? Have orders fulfilled by Granny's associates met the exacting standards of Granny's Guarantee?"
"219317028-0-1577";"Discerning Customer, your opinions are important to Granny Gravius and especially to this one. If you could find the time to complete your satisfaction survey it would mean the world to us. An extra cookie has been included for your high esteem."
"219317028-0-1578";"Discerning Customer, this one has not received your reply, no doubt due to overwhelming busyness and contentment with Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods. As an added service this one has taken the liberty of filling in the survey on your behalf. This one is humbled by your glowing praise."
"219317028-0-1579";"Hoo-wee! The ash folk are really starting to turn this place into something. It ain't Imperial City, mind, but it'll really be something when it's finished I bet. If that big ole rock don't fall on it."
"219317028-0-1580";"Granny's been asking around about that big ole rock and why the ash folk seem none too worried about it. Most were tight lipped as usual, but Granny found one who wouldn't shut up about one of their gods holding it there as long as they keep worshiping him. Granny's heard of worse reasons to pray."
"219317028-0-1581";"Now don't go repeating it to anyone you meet, but Granny's thinking about expanding out into the provinces since her business is doing so good. She's heard tell of a Forester's Guild that might be interested in Granny's Discount Pyre Wood business. She's just got to find them."
"219317028-0-1582";"Granny's having second thoughts about setting up shop out here. She's been up and down this twisted city for days now and whenever she asks one of these ash folk about doing business with their Forester's Guild they just give her funny looks and shuffle off faster than Granny can follow. No manners at all."
"219317028-0-1583";"Finally! Granny's found someone willing to show her to the Forester's Guild and she's going to meet with them tomorrow. Granny's tempted to give them an earful about making themselves so hard to find, but she wants to put her best foot forward. Wish Granny luck, dear."
"219317028-0-1584";"Well, the bad news is Granny's Discount Pyre Wood isn't of interest to the Forester's Guild out here, but the good news is Granny's was able to make some other business arrangements that ought to open the way into her expansion into the province. She's going to spring for some Mazte and celebrate!"
"219317028-0-1585";"Sorry, dear, that Granny isn't too chatty today. She got a little too wrapped up in her good fortunes last night. She had these lovelies set aside for you though."
"219317028-0-1586";"Now Granny hadn't planned on an extended trip to this peculiar place, but she was chatting with this affable High Elf who entertained ole Granny with stories of countless Dwarf ruins and she got to thinking about all that stuff just going to waste in a bunch of dusty holes. Granny can't have that!"
"219317028-0-1587";"Granny hired herself one of those caravaners to take her around now, so she's going to take in the sights on her way to some of these Dwarf holds. The caravaner insisted Granny hire a fighter escort, but she's never needed anything of the sort before and she's not about to start now."
"219317028-0-1588";"Did Granny tell you how much she likes these big bugs they ride out here? Silt Striders they're called. Her vision ain't what it used to be, but she can see out near a mile if it's clear. Which it isn't most of the time, mind."
"219317028-0-1589";"Granny's glad she didn't have to slog through the soggy swamp on the way to Balmora, her old knees would have been creaking for certain. The caravaner says it's the last decent place to stop before we head to one of those Dwarf holds."
"219317028-0-1590";"Granny never realized how frugal the ash folk are. You know some of them use big ole bug carcasses for armor? Chitin they call it. Granny's gonna see if she can't rustle up a good bit before she heads back to the mainland. Just let Granny know if you want her to send any in a future shipment, dear."
"219317028-0-1591";"Well, Granny's about to poke her nose into some old Dwarf hold called Arkinghand or some such, so she might be out of touch a spell, but don't you worry. Granny will be back to tell you all about it in no time."
"219317028-0-1592";"Discerning Customer, as our proprietor explores new restocking opportunities in deep, hazardous holes of unknown peril and gruesome expiration this one will continue to offer Granny Gravius's finest Gently Used Goods for your needs. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1593";"Discerning Customer, this one wishes to assure you that if our proprietor should befall any pulverizing by large jagged rocks, mashing in ancient gears, or slow methodical dismemberment by diabolical persons or things, provisions have been made to ensure all deliveries will continue for the duration of your contract. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1594";"Hello again, dear! Granny's back in Balmora and resting her old bones. That Arkinghand place weren't nothing much to write about she's afraid. Granny just couldn't seem to get some of those old Dwarf doors unstuck, so she spent a few days picking over a few dusty rooms. Nearly threw out her back trying to lift an old cog."
"219317028-0-1595";"Granny did find some old plates and cups that'll need a right good polishing, but should fetch a fair price. Granny's going to need to see what the market will bear for such specialty goods, but her gut's telling her that Dwarf goods aren't going to be worth the bother. Plenty of good gently used goods to be found closer to home. And above ground!"
"219317028-0-1596";"Granny's caravaner sure does know how to complain. He keeps telling Granny not to head out into the Ashlands because folk tend to keel over for good out in the wastes. Now, Granny says the only real wasteland is a place where perfectly useful goods are left lying about!"
"219317028-0-1597";"Granny's got to keep it short today. Got some darned lizard-bird thing swooping around us every few minutes."
"219317028-0-1598";"Granny's got to say, she's had it up to her ears with this bird-thing! She was enjoying not being pestered by all these pesky wild critters from up on her big bug and then this winged menace had to stick its beak where it isn't wanted. Granny swatted it with her walking stick, so it's giving her a wide berth now, but it hasn't given up."
"219317028-0-1599";"That fool scaled vulture is still following poor Granny. She can't imagine anything more annoying than a filthy scavenger lingering on your trail waiting for you to keel over and make'em an easy living. What Granny wouldn't give to have One-Eyed Tom on this trip."
"219317028-0-1600";"Granny finally gave that lizard-bird what was coming to it, pretended to nod off this evening and sure enough the chicken-livered beast came swooping down to have a peck of ole Granny. That's when she gave that pesky critter a solid wack on the head, climbed down to give it one last kick, and took some plumage too, for good measure."
"219317028-0-1601";"Granny's almost to the Ashlands, so she figures couriers will be hard to come by. She's sent word back to her place of business to make sure her favorite customer's well taken care of. Don't you worry none about old Granny, she's not going to let any overcooked patch of dirt get the best of her."
"219317028-0-1602";"Good news, loyal customers! Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods is pleased to announce a new line of quality products well suited for any special occasion: Granny Gravius's Rarefied Relics and Antiques!

Quality unmatched for centuries can soon be yours. Return your order form forthwith to secure your place on the waiting list. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1604";"Discerning Customer, this one has included a Dwemer leather scrap with your shipment. Note its suppleness and elasticity. Dwarven machine belts were manufactured to last thousands of hours of heavy use, but we have seen they can last thousands of years. Never risk popping a girdle again! Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1605";"Discerning Customer, attached is an artist's rendition of your home after just one easy order of Dwemer bowls and cups.

"219317028-0-1606";"Discerning Customer, this one is contacting you in regard to your account with Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods. There is nothing wrong with your account; however, you have not responded to the wondrous deals offered by Granny Gravius's Rarefied Relics and Antiques. This one wishes to know if you've received our mailings. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1607";"Discerning Customer, this one regrets to inform you that orders for Granny Gravius's Rarefied Relic and Antiques are no longer being accepted at this time. Any payments included for orders received after this date will be returned within ninety business days. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1608";"Hello, dear. Granny's still shaking the ashes out of her clothes from her jaunt through the Ashlands. Seems she wasn't the first to have the idea of poking around for unclaimed goods. Granny must have seen a dozen departed souls on the first day without so much as a loincloth stuck to their bones."
"219317028-0-1609";"Turns out there's a whole flock of ash folk that have their home out there and they don't leave nothing to waste. Now Granny won't be discouraged by those ash folk's claim to things, so she's having her caravaner take her out in search of their camp. He don't seem too happy about it, but Granny's paying so that's all there is to say on the matter."
"219317028-0-1610";"Wouldn't you know, we happened on a bunch of them Ashlanders following a herd of guar. They seemed even less happy about us being there than Granny's caravaner, but she put them in their place right quick. Granny isn't in the business of taking guff. She got them Ashlanders to lead her back to their tribe camp."
"219317028-0-1611";"The tribe elder was a shrewd one, even for ash folk. Granny can appreciate someone who knows there's a use to everything, and also a customer willing to pay a pretty drake for items of use. She thinks there's good trade to be had swapping our surplus now and again. Got to diversify to stay competitive in this economy."
"219317028-0-1612";"Well, Granny's had about enough of all this dust and she's finished most of her business with the ash folk, so she's going to be heading home. She's going to hop on a boat out of Dagon Fel and dip her toes in the Sea of Ghosts for a few days before she goes inland again."
"219317028-0-1613";"Hello, dear. Granny just wanted to let you know that she's making a little detour. Granny's got it on good authority that a mess of boats got themselves good and stuck in the last big freeze, and the creak in her knees are telling Granny there's a thaw coming."
"219317028-0-1614";"If there's nothing else you should listen to, it's Granny's creaky knees. Just like she figured, the ice flows are getting all slushy. Granny isn't the rower she used to be, but she found a perfectly good dinghy and the cold's good for her arthritis, so she'll be searching for those boats on the morrow!"
"219317028-0-1615";"Whew! Granny's found some muscles she plum forgot existed after all that rowing, but the exercise did her some good, and her business too! She's found herself those boats she'd heard about. Whole fleet of them, just sitting in the ice waiting to finish their voyage."
"219317028-0-1616";"Well, that ice was still sturdy enough for Granny to walk on, though she nearly slipped and busted her bum. At least nobody would have been around to see poor Granny in such a sorry state of affairs. Granny got a good look into some of those boats and she's sure it'll all be worth the trouble once she's got them freed."
"219317028-0-1617";"Near as Granny can tell, she's going to have to hire some helping hands if she plans to reclaim those poor trapped boats. She's going to take a few days to poke around the ports and find some enterprising younger folk that know a little ice ain't much to worry about."
"219317028-0-1618";"Discerning Customer, this one must notify you that Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods has switched to a new gentler packing material for fragile goods. Do not be alarmed by the presence of fur inside parcel. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1619";"REWARD: Lost Cat -- Black and bald, very affectionate, loves to be scratched -- Answers to Mangy Tim. Please contact Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods with information as to his whereabouts. Ask for Hawker."
"219317028-0-1620";"Discerning Customer, this one regrets to have possibly misinformed you in his last correspondence. If one of your recent deliveries included a cat, this was not one of Granny's loyalty gifts. This one would appreciate if the cat was returned expeditiously. This one will credit your account for the trouble. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1621";"Good news, dear. Granny found some nice seafaring folks to work the gently used boats she found in the Sea of Ghosts. They were all smiles, even if they're short on teeth. Got near a dozen perfectly good ships that just needed a little chipping and a bit of airing out."
"219317028-0-1622";"These sea folk have just been a great help, gathering up some previously owned goods on our trip back to the mainland. Between what got left in those boats and found out at sea, old Granny's gonna need another cart or two!"
"219317028-0-1623";"Granny thought about selling those nice boats, but she could tell the sea folk had grown attached to them and Granny's got a head for the long game. She's going to keep the dears in her employ since they've got such a good knack for turning up goods at sea."
"219317028-0-1624";"Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods is pleased to announce new shipping discounts on port to port transactions. Why turn out your pockets when Granny can provide you with someone else's? Never forget, your answer's always within Granny's reach!"
"219317028-0-1625";"GREAT REWARD: Lost Cat -- Missing about a week, used to being indoors -- please consult illustrated likeness -- answers to Mangy Tim, or food. Please contact Hawker at Granny Gravius's Gently Used Goods with any information. He is missed."
"219317028-0-1626";"Granny will bet you didn't realize just how demanding running a good supply business really is before she took your contract, did you, dear? She hopes you don't take it as a hint to upping her service charges at renewal time (which is approaching!) Granny's been happy to know someone's been out there listening to her chatter while she's working."
"219317028-0-1627";"Don't go thinking Granny's going to retire any time soon. Collecting all these bits and bobs for her loyal customers is just what old Granny does, she wouldn't know what to do with herself otherwise. You can count on Granny Gravius to keep your stores filled for many years to come."
"219317028-0-1628";"Not to say that Granny's not looking forward to getting home and taking a nice long break from her travels. Even old Granny needs a vacation now and again. The first things she's going to do is give a great big hug to each of her little darlings. She does hate to leave them for so long."
"219317028-0-1629";"Discerning Customer, this one wonders if you have not seen any patchy black cats in your travels. If you should find any, please send one to Granny Gravius's Gentle Used Goods by express courier and this one shall include a thank you with your next delivery. Fulfillment by Hawker."
"219317028-0-1630";"Granny's got some sad news today, dear. One of her precious kitties got into something he shouldn't have. She knows this sort of thing wouldn't have happened if she'd been home, but it's just the way of things. Not fretting over spilled milk."
"219317028-0-1631";"Don't you worry about, Granny, dear. It's never the same after one of her kitties counts to nine, but the loss passes quickly since Granny knows how to keep her little darlings with her always. She's just got to make a little space for him."
"219317028-0-1632";"Discerning Customer, this one speaks for all of us in the Granny Gravius family when she says thank you for choosing us for your supply needs and we hope you'll renew your business with us again soon. Please accept this cookie as a token of Granny's appreciation. Fulfillment by Black-Foot."
"219317028-0-1633";"It is my extreme pleasure to offer you these fine woodworking materials. Most would balk at hiring a Wood Elf for such a task, but have no fear! This hireling is faithful to your needs. Devotedly yours, Orbinor the Faithful!"
"219317028-0-1634";"I've already met so many fascinating people on my journey. My village is somewhat secluded from the rest of Grahtwood, but I'm glad I decided to undertake this journey as your hireling. I hope you find my current shipment to your satisfaction."
"219317028-0-1635";"With all of my excitement of being hired, I forgot a very important detail! Many would be curious how the Green Pact may influence my current actions. Have no fear! All of my shipments are secured through traveling merchants I've come to meet. Yes, my personal profit may be cut, but I assure you that your gold is being well spent."
"219317028-0-1636";"Another clarification I'd like to make is that I am NOT traveling within Grahtwood for these materials! I've been traveling and trading along Elsweyr. I'd never desecrate the Valenwood for my own profit. Please, take this shipment and my apologies if I alarmed you with that thought."
"219317028-0-1637";"For the past few nights I've been traveling with a group of Redguards. They've been very welcoming, and gladly accepted an extra helping hand. How kind! I always thought the Redguards would be more cold to strangers. Their woodworker does amazing work, though I'm sure not as amazing as what you'll craft from this shipment."
"219317028-0-1638";"Today I watched the Redguard's woodworker as she crafted several bows. Her name is Jossai, an elder with much wisdom to share.  She seemed surprised by my questions, and told me she had never met a Wood Elf interested in woodworking before. She even offered to show me some techniques. I politely declined, of course, but how nice of her to ask!"
"219317028-0-1639";"Elsweyr may be different from home, but the trees feel the same. Sometimes I'll watch as my companions begin to cut a tree down, and I'm amazed how calm they appear. I try not to think about it much. I'd rather imagine the wonderful things you'll create with this shipment!"
"219317028-0-1640";"I wonder what you'll make from my latest shipment? Perhaps a lovely fire staff, or a strong, solid shield! Why, the possibilities are endless. I hope whatever you make helps you throughout your adventures."
"219317028-0-1641";"When I speak of my trade to others, I'm often met with confusion. I know it's not uncommon for Wood Elves to trade for wooden wares, but to make a career out of it does stand out. I can't help it though, my love for woodworking simply cannot be ended! Please enjoy yourself on my behalf as you craft items from the materials in this shipment."
"219317028-0-1642";"Today a Redguard spoke to me about my business practices. He wondered how much profit I made, buying materials as a hireling rather than gather them myself. He balked when I admitted my numbers. Yes, perhaps my current trade will not bring me great wealth, but the thought of you using these materials to their fullest is fulfillment enough."
"219317028-0-1643";"I thank you for the continued faith you've had in me as your hireling. With all of the trade available in Elsweyr, I have no worries in missing my shipment deadlines. Most merchants I meet have crafting materials on hand, and are more than happy to sell or trade them."
"219317028-0-1644";"I've begun to dally about Jossai's tent even more lately. She already taught me several woodworking techniques, though naturally it's simply to sate my curiosity. I could never actually take on the practice myself! No matter how tempting the thought may be…."
"219317028-0-1645";"I've finally gathered the nerve to tell Jossai about the rumors that have been circulating through the camp about us. All she did was laugh, though I've never felt more humiliated. She told me, 'It's not me whom you love, but my trade.' I bit my tongue. Yes, I may have a fascination with woodworking, but I wouldn't say I love it!"
"219317028-0-1646";"The Redguards are often thankful for the meat I bring in, and I'm more than happy to share with them. Last night they offered me a bowl of their stew, which I of course politely declined. Naturally, I've never eaten vegetables, so I can't say I dislike them from personal experience. But the very smell of cooked Green turns my stomach."
"219317028-0-1647";"I can never wrap my head around the thought of eating the Green. All my life I've been taught to respect Y'ffre's wisdom, to not harm the Green which she so lovingly created. The thought of even breaking off a tree branch sets my teeth on edge. How do they do it? Well, no need to answer. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually."
"219317028-0-1648";"Today I've decided to say goodbye to my Redguard companions. Jossai wished to give me a token of thanks, a lovely walking stick that she had carved for sale. I politely declined, of course. I've attached my last purchase from this group, but I'm positive I'll quickly be able to find other merchants to gather crafting material from soon!"
"219317028-0-1649";"Still traveling alone, but I hope to meet another group of travelers soon. The woods can be very dangerous at night. This shipment came from a somewhat shady Nord I met along the road. A fine trader, but not someone who I cared to camp with."
"219317028-0-1650";"Still searching for a group, but I've been able to pick up crafting materials here and there. I'm sure you would hate for your faithful hireling to fall prey to bandits or some such! Always safety in numbers. Still, I'm ever vigilant about my shipments. Please enjoy these materials!"
"219317028-0-1651";"Met that shady Nord on the road again. The good news is that he was able to sell me the materials for this latest shipment. The bad news is that I believe he may be following me. Perhaps I'll travel within the forest for a few days. Just in case."
"219317028-0-1652";"I had a great revelation today. After not meeting a single merchant for days, I stood amidst a grove of trees, worrying about my next shipment. As I looked around I noticed how much dead limber was collected upon the forest's floor. There's no harm in taking what has already fallen! Please enjoy this shipment of freshly collected materials."
"219317028-0-1653";"I've been thinking lately about my current collection methods. Surely Y'ffre does not mind take I that which has already fallen? I'm not hurting the Green in any way. So I've begun to wonder if perhaps I may partake in a meal of fruit that has also already fallen? I'll think upon it, but for now here is your latest shipment."
"219317028-0-1654";"After much thought I've decided against eating fruit, even that which has dropped from the trees. I'm not sure if my stomach could handle it, not to mention the diseases that I might develop. I'm not sure how the other races can handle such a diet. My collection of woodworking materials continues, however. Please enjoy!"
"219317028-0-1655";"I've finally found a group of Wood Elves to travel with, though I haven't been met with the warmest reception. I believe my currently employment is somewhat off-putting for them. I've tried to explain my reasoning, but to no avail. Still, here is your shipment, as promised!"
"219317028-0-1656";"It's odd that my Wood Elf companions are quieter than the group of Redguards I traveled with. The look in their eyes makes the back of my neck crawl, especially when I'm trading for your crafting materials. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be with this group. But have no fear! I'll still make sure my shipments are timely and well stocked."
"219317028-0-1657";"I send you this shipment along with a bit of bad news. I seemed to have unwillingly entered quite a ... debate last night with the Wood Elf group that I'm traveling with. They questioned my loyalty to the Green Pact, and tried to convince me to leave my line of current work. Of course I have no such wish! Still, their words are hard to swallow."
"219317028-0-1658";"I'm often met with skepticism when I talk of my conviction in the Pact. No matter! As long as I hold faith, I don't care what others say. Just because I cannot easily obtain or use these crafting materials does not mean that it goes against my faith to send them to you. I hope you're able to craft a fine piece from this shipment."
"219317028-0-1659";"I met a spot of trouble while collecting this shipment for you. A few of the Wood Elves I'm traveling with happened to catch me as I gathered your materials, and began to question what I was doing. I calmly explained that all I had collected was already fallen, but they simply refuse to listen. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be welcomed."
"219317028-0-1660";"Today I was asked to leave the Wood Elf group I was traveling with. They were quite candid in that they wished to not be seen with someone they so easily called a ''traitor to the pact.'' Well, I never! It's certainly all right, as I'd rather travel on my own than with those who would mock me."
"219317028-0-1661";"I know it may sound odd, but lately I've been dreaming of woodworking. Oftentimes I imagine a woodworker I've met on the road, but sometimes it's my own hands that craft the wood. I always awake feeling guilty … but also excited. I'm not sure who else I can speak of this to. Thank you for being not only my employer, but a steadfast confidant."
"219317028-0-1662";"Are there Wood Elves who are woodworkers? I'm not sure how they would be able to overcome this guilt. It's odd, but I never had these questions before leaving home. I hope you'll enjoy this shipment, and please feel free to ignore my questions. I'm sure I'll find my answers during the course of my journey."
"219317028-0-1663";"I realize that my last few letters may have you questioning my commitment to the Pact. Simply because I have these urges does not mean I will act upon them. I'm sure many Wood Elves go through the same feelings once they've learned of the wonders of woodworking. I'll eventually learn to suppress it, you'll see! For now, it's enough to help you."
"219317028-0-1664";"As always, here is your shipment! You know, I just realized this, but I've never fully explained to my family back home what my current employment entails. I speak of traveling and trading, but never of the materials I work with. I've resolved to send them a letter to correct this, as soon as possible."
"219317028-0-1665";"Do you happen to recall the shady Nord fellow I traded with, after leaving the Redguards? Well, by Y'ffre, I've met him again! I'm not quite sure if it's a stroke of luck or.... No, there's no way this man is following me. That would be ridiculous. Just coincidence, that's all!"
"219317028-0-1666";"Last night I had to sleep in a tree, courtesy of a hungry pack of wolves.  Thank goodness they didn't catch me in a more open area! I'll have to make sure to find a traveling group soon. I could hardly keep my eyes open today as I collected these materials for your shipment."
"219317028-0-1667";"I've met a group of Khajiit that I've begun to travel with. It's harder to trust them than my other traveling companions, but they've shown interest in helping me collect crafting materials for my shipments. As always, my work to you comes first! I'll just make sure to keep my gold close at hand."
"219317028-0-1668";"I've attempted several times to write a letter home explaining my current employment, but somehow the right words elude me. I don't wish them to think ill of me, but I know that if I could speak in person I could explain my unwavering commitment to the Pact. Perhaps it's best to wait until I visit home for such an explanation."
"219317028-0-1669";"Though the Khajiit are far more welcoming than my last group, I find their humor strange. One of them will say something that doesn't appear to be a joke, and the rest of the group will suddenly begin to laugh. I can't help but feel I'm missing something here. Something I never miss, however, is your shipment! Enjoy!"
"219317028-0-1670";"Lately a young Khajiit named Nullini has been asking me questions about the Pact. I'm not sure if she's perhaps considering converting to the Green Pact (an odd choice for someone of her kind), but for now I've decided it's simply a curiosity of the unknown. And who am I to judge her for holding an interest outside the norms of her race?"
"219317028-0-1671";"Today I discussed my diet with Nullini, explaining why I only eat meat. She pointed to my latest shipment. ''You collect that which Nullini's people have felled, yet you cannot eat what we have picked?'' I had a hard time explaining the difference, but adamantly refused her offer of recently cooked vegetables. The very thought turns my stomach sour."
"219317028-0-1672";"Last night Nullini told me, ''My people fall a tree, and your employer crafts it. Why do you accept this, yet cannot work the wood yourself?'' I tried to explain, but she simply shook her head. ''The tree is fallen. The wood is crafted. In the end, all is the same.'' You understand my reasoning, don't you? It's simply different, if I do it myself."
"219317028-0-1673";"I've been thinking of Nullini's question. Why does the thought of others harvesting the Green not offend me? As long as it is not from the Valenwood, and as long as I don't harm the Green myself, I find myself uncaring. I know many of my kind hold this view, but why? I hope this shipment is enough to forgive my never-ending questions."
"219317028-0-1674";"I recently remarked to Nullini how odd it was that she knew so little of Wood Elf customs. I have a hard time reading Khajiit expressions, but I believe I struck a nerve. She snapped at me, ''Well, what do you know of my people?'' And then she stalked right off! You know, I do think she's right. Perhaps it's time to ask some questions myself."
"219317028-0-1675";"The Khajiit's have a strange religion. Do you know they believe themselves the perfect people? I wouldn't imagine the perfect race quite so ... furry. Of course I held my tongue when Nullini told me this. I can't afford to offend those I travel with, lest I disrupt my shipments to you."
"219317028-0-1676";"There are so many Khajiit gods! Nullini was patient as she explained them, but I'm not quite sure why a religion has to be so complicated. When I remarked so, Nullini simply laughed and said, ''Complicated? This one would go mad, should she be told to follow as many rules as you do!'' How funny an outside view can be!"
"219317028-0-1677";"I finally wrote a letter home. It must have been five pages long! I had Nullini look it over. Twice. She told me that any family who would be upset by a son such as myself are fools. I have to admit, I did tear up at that. She pretended not to notice. I never thought a Khajiit would become one of my most steadfast friends."
"219317028-0-1678";"Another camp, another rumor. I'm not shocked that the others think I'm sweet on Nullini, but it is irksome. She takes the comments in stride though. I'm glad to have her wit, as I simply blush and grow silent when a snide comment is made. Nullini's also becoming a reliable partner in collecting my materials, and her fees are quite reasonable."
"219317028-0-1679";"Yesterday, Nullini and I we were approached by one of the young Khajiit. He smirked and asked, ''That one has so many questions for you, Nullini. Tell me, has he asked for a taste?'' She simply waved her hand and replied, ''If he does, he'll get the same answer as you did!'' And then they both laughed! Khajiit truly are the strangest race."
"219317028-0-1680";"I've finally sat Nullini down and explained that her comments may be causing some to think that there was truth in the rumors of our relationship. She raised a brow and told me, ''They will tease, no matter what I say. Should this one simply blush, as you do?'' I told her to continue to do as she feels best, before making a hasty exit."
"219317028-0-1681";"Today a small group of bandits attacked us. The battle was quick, with no losses on our side. As I gathered my arrows, one of my companions lazily asked me, ''Tell me, Wood Elf, which do you find tastier? Breton or Redguard?'' I bit my tongue and went to my tent as she laughed. Despite the attack I've gathered your materials."
"219317028-0-1682";"I'm afraid my last letter may have sounded ungrateful. I've loved this opportunity to travel, and often times enjoy the company of the Khajiit. They have no woodworker, but they've been happy to show me furniture they hope to sell. They are lovely pieces, but I know you'll create something even lovelier with these materials."
"219317028-0-1683";"I'm shocked by how many believe that Wood Elves still eat corpses! I know it's not entirely out of practice, but to think that we all still uphold this tradition is ridiculous. Even Nullini asked me, and I answered so angrily we haven't spoken since. Despite what they may think, the Khajiit were still willing to trade with me for this shipment."
"219317028-0-1684";"I finally was able to make amends with Nullini. She has a quick temper, but also a kind heart. She's become an unexpected confidant during this journey. I will miss her when I leave, though I will not miss her incessant questions. They leave me far too confused. But the one thing I am sure about is being your hireling!"
"219317028-0-1685";"Nullini has been allowed to write this letter, as an apology for Orbinor's rudeness. This one is not allowed to write anything ''unseemly.'' She may not request you send more gold, tell any of Orbinor's silly secrets, or say anything ''untoward'' your most striking person. So, in the words of my most distrustful companion, please enjoy your shipment!"
"219317028-0-1686";"I hope you didn't mind the fact that I allowed Nullini to write you my last letter. She seemed amused by the idea, but I assure you I read the letter over before sending it! Truth be told, that was her fourth draft. She kept writing the most inappropriate things! Still, she did help me gather this latest shipment for your convenience."
"219317028-0-1687";"Hello wise employer, Nullini speaks to you once more. Orbinor has received a letter from home and has refused to leave his tent. This one sends you his shipment in his stead.  She also assures you she is doing all that she can to comfort our friend. Even if it means hunting down his family and skinning them alive. Slowly."
"219317028-0-1688";"I apologize for Nullini's behavior! She had absolutely no right to send that latest letter. I'll make sure she is properly spoken to. If she asked you for more gold, please ignore it! I'm more than happy with our current arrangement. Very happy! I absolutely will not quit and move back home. Absolutely not! Here's your shipment!"
"219317028-0-1689";"I apologize for my rather abrupt letter that came to you with my last shipment. As you may have gleamed, my family has asked me to give up my trade and return home. They simply do not understand me. I feel more lost than ever now. But I will not give up. I believe it is time that I ventured forth and found my own truth. My own faith."
"219317028-0-1690";"If my time with the Khajiit have taught me anything, it's that I know so little of the world outside of Valenwood. I want to meet more people, discover new cultures and ways of thinking. And perhaps, through that, discover more about myself. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so. Please take this shipment, and my thanks."
"219317028-0-1691";"Nullini was upset that I've decided to leave the group, but I believe she understands. I was tempted to ask her to travel with me, but she's actually just recently became engaged! I couldn't be happier for my dear friend and her wife-to-be. If you receive any letters from her, please ignore them! I assure you, I'm quite happy with my current wage."
"219317028-0-1692";"I'm once more a party of one. When did my distrust in the Khajiit change to companionship? Perhaps it was Nullini's questions, no matter how perplexed they made me. Perhaps it was the easy banter, or the incessant teasing. At least I still have my letters to you. They help me organize my thoughts, and give me comfort in these lonely times."
"219317028-0-1693";"You'll not believe this, but I've met that shady Nord again. Yes, the one I've met twice already! Did he follow me? No, that's impossible. I didn't see him once during my time with the Khajiit. At least he sold me the materials for your latest shipment. Still, despite my more open mindset, I did not offer to camp with him."
"219317028-0-1694";"I swear to you, I went the direct opposite way that Nord was traveling! I did! And yet once again I met him on the road. How? How does this keep happening? It goes against all logic. I suppose I should just be grateful for his sales, but still! Now I'm very glad I've never offered to camp with him! Who knows what would happen?"
"219317028-0-1695";"So, I've begun to travel with the Nord. His name is Maginar Troll-Spit, but I'm just to call him Mag. Honestly, he told me this the first time I met him, and I still don't know if he's pulling my leg. This decision was made after a very close call with a particularly vicious strangler. Well, I simply must make the best of it!"
"219317028-0-1696";"Mag has quite a bit of advice for me, all unsolicited. First and foremost, he believes that I should grow a beard. ''Ain't right, a grown man with no proper beard!'' he tells me, stroking his own rather remarkable, crumb covered whiskers. I simply nod rather than argue. At least he's a steady supply of crafting materials for my shipments to you."
"219317028-0-1697";"A nice thing about traveling with Mag is that he's more than happy to help me collect woodworking materials. He always seems to have some on hand to sell me. It's nice to have someone not bound by the Pact to help with these shipments. I hate to admit it, but he's been more useful than Nullini with how quick he collects!"
"219317028-0-1698";"Mag's latest unsolicited advice was directed towards my preferred weaponry. ''A bow? Nonsense! You get yourself an axe and look your prey dead in the eye. None of this sneaky business, ain't honorable!'' Again, I only nodded. The Nord sure has a lot to say about my bow, but he eats my kills happily enough."
"219317028-0-1699";"Last night I learned that Mag has a surprisingly deep knowledge of the Green Pact, and it seems the one thing we agree with on is my interpretation of it. And wouldn't you know it, he actually told me that he once followed the Pact! Him, a Nord! I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I would like to know more if he would tell me."
"219317028-0-1700";"I feel like I've begun quoting Mag quite a lot in my letters to you. Perhaps it's because he doesn't usually let me get a word in when we talk. It was a nice change of pace talking about the Pact with him. For once he seemed to actually listen. His words almost seemed careful, respectful. I wonder why this topic brought such a change?"
"219317028-0-1701";"My last letter spoke too soon. Though Mag is respectful of my interpretation of the Pact, he still has much to say about how I go about my practices. ''You want dead trees?'' he asked me with a chuckle. ''Go to Skyrim! Most every living thing up there freezes to death eventually!'' Well, if Skyrim is so great, why doesn't he go back?"
"219317028-0-1702";"I was trying to conceive a reason a Nord would have to commit to the Green Pact, but the truth was far from any answer I could have surmised. Marriage! Mag married a Wood Elf who was deeply committed to the Pact. He followed it because of, well, because of love. I honestly can't imagine it. Mag? With a Wood Elf? I simply must know more now!"
"219317028-0-1703";"Mag has so much to say about the Pact. ''I didn't much care about not using wood, but the food? Meat! Milk! Eggs! My stomach could barely take it. It felt like my mouth was covered in a layer of grease. And that's from me, a Nord!'' He has yet to speak of his wife, and I'm hesitant to ask. He never writes letters home. What happened to her?"
"219317028-0-1704";"I've begun gathering wood with Mag, collecting from the underbrush as he chops down branches. It's strange, I used to be more squeamish watching the practice. I suppose I've gotten used to the sound of splitting wood, the sight of its pale insides. It barely fazes me anymore, and I'm not sure how to feel about that."
"219317028-0-1705";"Mag finally spoke of his wife, after quite a few bottles of Mead. She grew sick one day, eventually coming close to death. He begged her to take medicine, but she refused. He told me, ''And what of our future cubs? Would she just let them die, for her Pact?'' I know she would have. It's a hard choice, but it's our way of life. I can see why he left."
"219317028-0-1706";"The Pact is not always easy. The Pact is not always fair. There's not always a healer nearby, and medicine is simply not the way of my kind. Perhaps it was not my place to tell you Mag's tale, but I felt the need to share it with someone. Please accept this shipment, and my gratitude. You've always been a trustworthy confidant."
"219317028-0-1707";"I know that Mag's tale is very sad, but I can't help but think about a few... logistics. He spoke of their future children, so that must have meant ... well, it must mean that they, or rather they were at least planning to ... but how? How would that have worked .... Please, feel free to ignore my questions and simply enjoy this shipment."
"219317028-0-1708";"Mag decided to restock his supplies in a nearby Khajiit settlement. We haven't spoken much since we told me about his wife. Honestly, I wish I had never asked. The settlement is nice enough, but Mag wishes to travel on as soon as we can. This shipment was sold to me from local merchants, and I hope their quality is to your liking!"
"219317028-0-1709";"I've decided to stay in the settlement for awhile. Mag simply shrugged when I told him. I asked him one last question before he left. Why stay? Why not return to Skyrim? He told me, ''Sometimes it's better to live in the comfort of sadness, than in the sadness of comfort.'' Huh. Perhaps you'll understand those words better than I."
"219317028-0-1710";"The settlement I'm staying in is nice, but I'm hoping for another group of travelers to arrive soon. I've now journeyed with Redguards, Khajiit, and even a Nord. Who would think I would find such diverse traveling companions? Being a hireling has opened my eyes to the world. Perhaps I should look towards other lands next."
"219317028-0-1711";"Today a most strange family of Wood Elves came upon the settlement. At first I thought them Bretons, simply from the fact that their clothes were, well, cloth. I think I'd be less shocked if they were stark naked! I think I'll speak to them tomorrow. They're the first of my kind I've met in weeks. I'll let you know how it goes."
"219317028-0-1712";"I still haven't spoken to the Wood Elf family. It's odd, I know, but I feel ... strange. Unsure. The father of the family is a woodworker. I thought this would be exciting. I've wondered so often if there was someone of my kind who took up the craft, but now that I have that answer .... Perhaps I'll speak to them tomorrow."
"219317028-0-1713";"Though I'm still unsure why I held such initial hesitation, I've finally spoken to the family. They're quite nice! I wonder if I'm the first Wood Elf they've spoken to in a long time. They told me that they originally lived in Cyrodiil, but moved south after the recent crisis. What a lovely family. I must visit them again tomorrow."
"219317028-0-1714";"The Wood Elf family I've recently become acquainted with has already invited me to travel. I'm not sure why I hesitated to accept. I'm just being silly, that's all. The father's name is Banion, and he's also in need of woodworking material. I believe our travels will be mutually beneficial. Already he's helped me gather this shipment for you!"
"219317028-0-1715";"I'm an embarrassment of a hireling. Yesterday the children of the family helped me gather my materials. The daughter began to snap off twigs from trees, and I chided her, as if she was my own! It took me a moment to remember myself. These children were not raised to follow the Pact, and it's not my place to question that."
"219317028-0-1716";"I don't understand it! Nullini and Mag would help me collect materials, and they would often take from living trees. But the fact that these Wood Elf children share the same practice sets my teeth on edge. I would ask to gather alone, but I don't wish to offend my hosts. What's wrong with me? I really must get a hold of myself!"
"219317028-0-1717";"Little ones can be as curious as Khajiit, and the children in this family are no exception. They'll often ask me about the Pact, and honestly I'm a tad surprised their parents have never explained the practice. Well, it's not my place to ask. I'll just bother you with all my silly thoughts! I hope this shipment can make up for my prattling."
"219317028-0-1718";"Today I was approached by Banion. He raised concerns about my conversations with the little ones. ''We just don't want to give them the wrong idea, is all,'' he explained. ''We don't want them to think they're doing anything wrong by not following the Pact.'' I promised to avoid the topic, but the whole conversation has left me perturbed."
"219317028-0-1719";"I can't help but feel uneasy now. Was I perhaps preaching more than I realized? I may be devoted to the Pact, and I may find it a little odd that Banion and his family don't follow it. But who am I to say what they should believe? I think it's about time I asked them for an explanation. Perhaps that will clear up any misunderstandings."
"219317028-0-1720";"I've done it, I've asked Banion why him and his family don't follow the Pact. And you know what he said? He simply shrugged and told me, ''I just wasn't raised to it. I know plenty of Wood Elves who don't follow it. Most of us outside of Valenwood, really.'' Am I truly so ignorant? Am I the unusual one to them? I need time to think of this."
"219317028-0-1721";"You know, I've realized something. This entire time I've been with this family, I've been ... I've been judging them. I've been judging them just like other Wood Elves judged me. I've been looking down on them, thinking less of them. Me! And it's been as natural to me as breathing. I was so shocked by this I almost forgot to send your shipment!"
"219317028-0-1722";"I've been so curious about this family, but not about the right things. Today I simply asked them about their beliefs. They follow the Eight Divines, but still respect nature. They harm as little of the Green as they can, they give thanks for what they've taken. Even without Y'ffre's guidance, they still show admiration in their own way."
"219317028-0-1723";"The children seem to have sensed my reluctance to speak about the Pact, so they've begun to stick to questions about Valenwood. Oh, I hardly knew how to begin. To speak of the glory of Elden Root, and quiet seclusion of the groves. I suddenly found my eyes wet with tears. I didn't realize how much I missed it all."
"219317028-0-1724";"Thinking back to my last letter, I want to make one thing absolutely clear. I've never been, not one day, ungrateful for the support you've given me. You've let me walk with the Redguards, hunt with the Khajiit. You've opened my eyes to my culture, to my people, myself. And all by just allowing me to be your hireling. Thank you."
"219317028-0-1725";"I'm sorry if this letter is short. Last night Banion brought out some jagga he had traded for. I'm afraid I drank a tad too much. Please enjoy this shipment."
"219317028-0-1726";"In the early morning, before the rest of the family awoke, Banion told me of his wish to travel to Valenwood. He feels it could be a new home, but worries that his family won't be accepted. I couldn't say much. Even I worry about returning. Still, I told him, ''Well, I'm proud to call you a fellow Wood Elf.'' And you know what? I truly am."
"219317028-0-1727";"Yesterday Banion gave me some advice that I've been mulling over for awhile now. He told me that while his family has enjoyed my company, and appreciates my help, that perhaps it was time for me to go home. I do admit I miss it. My home, my woods, my family. But is it the right move to make? I'll have to consider it."
"219317028-0-1728";"I'm glad for my friendship with Banion, but I don't think I'll heed his advice. I've learned much, but I've also unlearned a great deal as well. My viewpoints, my prejudices, my own faith .... I've begun to question so many things. And that's good! That helps me grow. Going home now will only be a step back. It's time to look forward."
"219317028-0-1729";"From the bottom of my heart, I truly wish to thank you for all that you've allowed me to do. Through your patience and patronage, I was able to learn a great deal. About other cultures, and other philosophies, but mostly about myself. I may not have all the answers yet, but I'm excited for what is to come. Nervous, perhaps, but ready and willing."
"219317028-0-1730";"Well met, good smith! I am forge master Ludovic Laumont of the most reputable and renowned Four Irons Smeltery. It is my great honor to provide the finest in materials to artisans such as yourself. Included is your inaugural shipment. May it serve you well."
"219317028-0-1731";"The reputation of the Four Irons is most certainly what brought us your business, but I assure you that it wasn't established overnight. Twelve generations of exacting Laumont business is what has forged our legacy into a household name. Again I bring you that quality today."
"219317028-0-1732";"Pay no attention to stories that the Laumont line emerged from a union between man and flame atronach, or that our children are born from a furnace. We Bretons are prone to flights of fancy and exhibit a natural flare for embellishment."
"219317028-0-1733";"The Laumont talent for metalwork in all its forms didn't materialize from some divine spark. It was hammered into our blood by decades of tradition and refinement, perfected by the hands and hammers of my ancestors so that I might share it with the world."
"219317028-0-1734";"Did I mention Four Irons is a learning institution? It's true! In addition to passing our techniques on to our inherently talented kin, we educate hard working apprentices the world over in the art of metallurgy."
"219317028-0-1735";"Why we're expecting a new apprentice coming all the way from Orsinium to learn the Laumont family's trademark artistry. I'm quite excited at the opportunity to impart the burgeoning society of the Orcs with the benefit of some Breton culture."
"219317028-0-1736";"Excuse the brevity. Our guest will arrive tomorrow and preparations must be made. All orders will continue as scheduled."
"219317028-0-1737";"The adjustment period for the new arrival might be longer than I would normally expect. The boy hasn't said a word since he arrived, though he responds to my direction. Truth be told I wouldn't have thought this hulking brute the same age as my own son had I not been told so before meeting him. His arm is thick as my waist."
"219317028-0-1738";"Well, young Urbek is settling in. We had intended to board him with the other apprentices, but his cot collapsed and he's expressed a preference for the basement. By which I mean he grunted in annoyance and stretched out on the stone floor. He seems comfortable enough."
"219317028-0-1739";"It seems the Orcs of clan Tumnosh are practiced stone breakers and miners. That might explain why the lad they sent me resembles an ox. I've given him a tour of our marvelous metal works and the rich history of the Laumont family that he will be carrying on, but the boy actually yawned. I feel like I'm wasting my breath!"
"219317028-0-1740";"I'm hesitant to put Urbek to work in the forge, even to work the bellows. If you've had any experience dealing with Orcs, the advice would be appreciated. For the moment, I've shown him to our mine and asked him to dig ore."
"219317028-0-1741";"Sheor's blood, that Orc boy can dig. I've got a heap of fresh minerals nearly my own height. You can thank him for ensuring you see a steady supply for the foreseeable future. I think he'd still be going if he hadn't mangled every pickaxe in our stores."
"219317028-0-1742";"Now that Urbek can appreciate where the ore comes from, I think it's time he sees how we transform it into a usable form. He's going to bring up a load from the mine to work with. With any luck he'll be smelting metal suitable of the Laumont seal."
"219317028-0-1743";"I beg your greatest pardons if this delivery was delayed. Urbek drug the entire mine cart up to the smeltery and nearly buried us. It's not in my nature to shout at a learning mind, thank the gods, because I don't think I'd survive angering the boy."
"219317028-0-1744";"At least the boy can clear a mess as fast as he can make one. The smeltery is clear of debris again. Today's lesson won't be anything fancy, but the basics of melting points and mold casting are essential whether you're working with simple copper or something as rare as Ebony."
"219317028-0-1745";"Every apprentice reaches a point where they think they know better than the master, some laborious step seems a waste of time so they take the short cut. I didn't expect Urbek to reach that point so soon. He's begun hammering the ore on my anvil. He'll see reason soon enough."
"219317028-0-1746";"He cracked the anvil. I'm so mad I could spit. Forgive me. Here's your order."
"219317028-0-1747";"My great-great-great-grandfather forged the blades of five dynasties on that anvil, and his great-great-great-grandfather before him cast it right into the foundation of this site. It is the bedrock of this establishment. Now defaced by a great fissure, I'll likely have to replace it entirely!"
"219317028-0-1748";"I realized that in taking you into my confidence with this dilemma, it may reflect poorly on our business relationship. The Four Irons maintains several other working anvils, so there will be no delays in our ongoing service to you, good smith."
"219317028-0-1749";"You needn't linger on any questions of the quality of the services you've paid for. Let me just say that after centuries of daily labor, my ancestral anvil had never once required repair and this should only underscore the exceptional circumstances under which Four Irons produced goods could fail."
"219317028-0-1750";"In fact, the Laumont family can attest that its workmanship has endured many generations, through times of war and peace alike. Why, it's said that the black blade of the Iron Son cut down ten thousand warriors during his reign. Who did that ancient lord of Camlorn entrust to work the rarest iron in Tamriel? The Laumonts, that's who."
"219317028-0-1751";"That reminds me, the Four Irons Smeltery is supremely qualified to handle all forms of metal, both known and unknown to man and mer alike. Such work is prohibitively costly. Why risk it with inferior workmanship when our expertise is always at your service, good smith?"
"219317028-0-1752";"I can only assume the components provided by the Four Irons have served beyond your greatest expectations. We remain humbly at your service."
"219317028-0-1753";"Urbek has finally been convinced of the merits of smelting and heating the metal before beating it into shape. He raw forged a blade he was quite proud of until he shattered it on one of my shields. When I regained feeling in my arm I showed him how to work out the impurities. Progress at last."
"219317028-0-1754";"Are all Orcs so single-mindedly fixated on the physicality of action? This boy has almost no concept of subtlety or finesse. If an act is not punctuated with the percussion of violence, it seems to hold no value. I thought he might explode at any moment when I made him carefully pour our last batch of ingots into their molds. He still has to scour the first batch off the walls and floor."
"219317028-0-1755";"Urbek has reached a competency that it suitable to see honest work. He may be ready to show you his own handiwork soon enough. Rest assured that nothing will be permitted to reach your forge without first being inspected and measured up to the standards of the Laumont family name."
"219317028-0-1756";"I had intended for Urbek to include his own professional correspondence with his first work, as establishing a healthy rapport with their customers is a vital skill for a craftsman, but he has great difficulty with writing. No stylus or paper has been forged that can survive his penmanship."
"219317028-0-1757";"The Laumont family recognizes the value of passion in learning, so Urbek is currently working on a personal project. I've included these components from our stores, which I'm certain you will find more than satisfactory."
"219317028-0-1758";"Urbek is cleverer than he appears. He's been hammering out metal sheets with letters on them, no doubt to refine his metal work and his literacy at the same time. The Laumont genius must be rubbing off at last."
"219317028-0-1759";"THI S URBEK.  URBEK SMASH Y OU THIS LETTER T O GO WITH OTHE R THINGS URBEK SM ASH FOR YOU. THEY A RE STUR DY."
"219317028-0-1760";"URBEK S MASH YOU NEW TH INGS. THESE NOT CRU MBLE BEFOR E URBEK DONE WITH SMAS HING. LITTLE CHIEF LAU MONT SAYS THEY AR E FINE."
"219317028-0-1761";"URBEK WORK OUT WAY TO SMASH WHOLE WORDS INSTEAD OF JUST LETTERS. WRITING GOES FASTER AND NEATER NOW. URBEK PLAN TO SMASH LETTER TO CLAN AFTER WORK FOR YOU IS DONE. URBEK NEVER THINK WRITING COULD BE FUN BEFORE LEARNING TO SMASH LETTERS."
"219317028-0-1762";"Apologies, good smith. When Urbek said he was finally writing you, I did not realize he was literally beating his rude concept of language into sheet metal. I assure you that this additional weight was not counted against your component orders. You are welcome to melt them down and put them to better use, of course."
"219317028-0-1763";"Urbek hasn't said a word to me since I forbade him from using our stock for his literary studies, not that he was talkative in the first place. Perhaps I was too hard on him."
"219317028-0-1764";"After some careful consideration, I've proposed a compromise to Urbek which he has found agreeable. He may continue his unique transcription methods provided he provides his own materials. If his correspondence becomes burdensome to you, don't hesitate to contact me on the matter."
"219317028-0-1765";"LITTLE CHIEF LAUMONT SAYS URBEK CAN SMASH YOU LETTERS AGAIN. URBEK NOT GET THE CHANCE TO WRITE HOME BEFORE, BUT WILL NOW. URBEK GLAD NOT TO WRITE LIKE LITTLE CHIEF LAUMONT. TUMNOSH CLAN THINK URBEK GONE SOFT IF THEY GOT DAINTY BRETON LETTER."
"219317028-0-1766";"URBEK HOMESICK. BRETONS ARE TOO NEAT AND THEIR STONE IS TOO SOFT. URBEK ALWAYS SLEEP BETTER ON THE ROUGH STONE OF ANCESTOR'S QUARRY. URBEK SHOULD BE SMASHING AT ORC FORGES. HOW URBEK SUPPOSED TO IMPRESS FORGE-WIVES WITH FLIMSY BRETON CRAFT?"
"219317028-0-1767";"URBEK HOPE THAT THINGS URBEK SMASH FOR YOU ARE NOT EMBARRASSMENT TO ORC HERITAGE OR PATRON'S WORK. SMASH GREAT THINGS WITH THINGS URBEK SMASH FOR YOU."
"219317028-0-1768";"LITTLE CHIEF LAUMONT SAYS URBEK HAS TROUBLE FINISHING. URBEK'S WORK LACKS POLISH. URBEK THINK SHINING IS FOR MIRRORS AND THE SUN."
"219317028-0-1769";"LITTLE CHIEF LAUMONT SAYS URBEK WILL LEARN TO CUT METAL NEXT. URBEK THINK THIS MIGHT BE LESSON WORTH LEARNING."
"219317028-0-1770";"Eight grant me patience. Urbek just ruined a perfectly good breastplate. Carved the whole thing to ribbons like some feast fowl. Ludicrous as it might sound, steel may be too delicate a metal for his engraving lessons."
"219317028-0-1771";"URBEK WRONG, THIS LESSON IS STUPID."
"219317028-0-1772";"LITTLE CHIEF LAUMONT HAS URBEK MAKING SCRATCHES IN EBONY. IT REMIND URBEK OF WRITING WITH PEN AND PAPER. SO SLOW. HOW DO YOU STAND IT?"
"219317028-0-1773";"URBEK DECIDE TO HELP OTHERS SMASH LETTERS SINCE CARVING WITH PEN AND INK IS DUMB AND SLOW. OTHERS ARE TOO WEAK FOR URBEK METHOD AND SO IS PAPER. URBEK HAVE TO GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT."
"219317028-0-1774";"URBEK NOT SMASH YOU THIS LETTER. URBEK DIP HIS LETTERS IN INK AND PRESS THEM ON PAPER. IT IS MESSY AND STILL SLOW, BUT IT WORK. URBEK SEE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT."
"219317028-0-1775";"These engraving exercises have had an unexpected side effect. I believe Urbek is finally learning to appreciate the results of taking a lighter touch and is attempting more conventional writing again. When I saw him blackened as he was I thought he'd been stoking the fires by hand again, but it was ink that his hands were covered in."
"219317028-0-1776";"URBEK STILL SMASHING NEW STAMPS, BUT HAVE BREAKTHROUGH. URBEK SMASH RAILS TO HOLD LETTERS IN LINE. URBEK CAN SMASH WHOLE LINE INTO INKPAN THEN SMASH INTO PAPER. IT WORK FASTER THAN WHEN URBEK SMASHING WORDS INTO PLATE FOR YOU."
"219317028-0-1777";"Urbek finished new set of stamps. Now Urbek have lower case. It seems like a waste to Urbek to have second set of same letters, but different. Urbek would have just smashed new letters. Tamrielic stupid language."
"219317028-0-1778";"Urbek has smashed you best letter to date. Urbek think you not even know it Urbek who send it if you never seen Urbek's prototyping. This way not as fun for writing, but Urbek see potential."
"219317028-0-1779";"You know I found Urbek reading yesterday? He must be making good progress with his composition. I'm glad I saw the value in encouraging his education. It's not like he'd ever have these opportunities in his homeland, so we must make the most of his time here."
"219317028-0-1780";"When I described the Four Irons as a learning institution to you, good smith, I had only meant to infer that it was a place where aspiring metal workers could learn their craft from the best, but Urbek has proven that we can do more. We can instill culture and elevate our neighbors from their crude lot. I've never been more proud to be a Laumont."
"219317028-0-1781";"No doubt you have studied the art of the forge for some time now, good smith, but don't think that a Four Irons education is merely for apprentices. There are many journeymen and masters who grace us with the intent of exchanging techniques. I assure you that the value of such tutelage is well worth the price."
"219317028-0-1782";"You should know that Urbek's more conventional studies are coming along quite well, as you've no doubt noticed in the quality of the components being delivered. He's finally beginning to acquire the trademark Laumont flourish."
"219317028-0-1783";"Urbek sorry for not smashing you letters sooner. Urbek been busy learning about books. Books not of interest to Urbek before, but since Urbek has been smashing words Urbek taken bigger interest. You know paper is made of smashed trees? Urbek plan to try smashing paper soon."
"219317028-0-1784";"Urbek find book written by Little Chief Laumont. So many words. First half just talk about family and history. Urbek It take forever to get to part that useful for smashing. Prefer to just say what Urbek mean. Is that Breton thing? Urbek hope not to get lessons in wasting words."
"219317028-0-1785";"Smashing wood to paper much harder than Urbek expect. Have to sweep out workshop and pluck out splinters now, but Urbek get back to you."
"219317028-0-1786";"Urbek decide it best to buy paper from now on. Urbek on to something more interesting than smashing wood into paper, so Urbek not stay distracted for sake of curiosity. Also, Urbek has to keep smashing your orders."
"219317028-0-1787";"Just when I think the boy is making progress, he manages to remind me that he still struggles with his backward and unsophisticated roots. Just yesterday he pulverized a cord of firewood on the anvil. I never thought I'd have to explain that one cannot forge wood, but I suppose that made it a learning experience for both of us."
"219317028-0-1788";"I've decided to pair Urbek with another young man in my employ. I am hoping that the other lad's characteristic Redguard discipline will help mold Urbek into a more focused and dutiful student, and I'll admit it'll free me from having to keep so close an eye on our newest apprentice."
"219317028-0-1789";"It should come as no surprise that the Four Irons Smeltery sees quite a few Redguard come through its doors, both for arms and training. Farrokhzad, being a youth of noteworthy potential, was sent to refine his talents here two years ago. He has been a model student, to the surprise of no one."
"219317028-0-1790";"I've taken the liberty of sending some components Farrokh has worked with just so you can see what a more advanced student is capable of. His eye for quality is nearly as good as mine now, and that's why craftworkers across Tamriel send their aspiring talents to the Four Irons."
"219317028-0-1791";"Urbek is, of course, capable of reaching that quality bar, otherwise I wouldn't have him providing you with his work. He just requires more time and oversight to achieve what comes more naturally to a student like Farrokh. It's at the Four Irons that a student like Urbek can learn to make up that deficit."
"219317028-0-1792";"Little Chief Laumont pair Urbek with other apprentice. He doesn't talk so much. Urbek like him already."
"219317028-0-1793";"Farrokh smash metal pretty good. Urbek not see why it so important to smash with care. If things Urbek smashing not strong enough to survive smashing, why Urbek want to turn them into weapons?"
"219317028-0-1794";"Farrokh remind Urbek that most of what Urbek smash meant for customers not as strong as Urbek. Urbek has to learn to gently smash to make some things customers want. Urbek sorry if any things smashed for you were hard to use."
"219317028-0-1795";"Little Chief Laumont decide he want to teach us something new today. Urbek catch Farrokh trying not to yawn. Urbek glad not to be only one tired of all his talk. Urbek laugh with Farrokh about it later. Urbek perfect good Little Chief impression."
"219317028-0-1796";"Urbek think about writing book. Take note of lessons worth learning from Little Chief Laumont and put them in own words. Less words."
"219317028-0-1797";"Urbek perfect way to smash whole page of words at once. Will come in handy for book on smashing. Urbek need to smash more copies of letters."
"219317028-0-1798";"Urbek decide that it better to smash new letters in way better for gentle smashing on paper, so Urbek smash old letters into softer metal. Go much faster than when Urbek first smash letters."
"219317028-0-1799";"Farrokh inform Urbek that there are words for gentle smashing in Tamrielic. When Little Chief Laumont write his fancy letters and gently smash seal in wax it called ''pressing.'' Urbek still prefer to smash letters, but see why that confusing to others."
"219317028-0-1800";"Urbek started smashing book on smashing. Much as Urbek hate to admit it, Little Chief Laumont teach Urbek a lot. Urbek approach smashing metal like smashing rocks and there a lot more to smashing than that. Urbek put that in foreword."
"219317028-0-1801";"All this smashing about smashing stone for Clan Tumnosh making Urbek home sick. Urbek think time to smash new letter home is long overdue. Bet they curious about what Urbek learned since coming to Four Irons Smeltery."
"219317028-0-1802";"Good smith, we are amidst finishing our apprentices' evaluations for this period and the Four Irons Smeltery would welcome any opinions on your experiences with Urbek. This information would of course be confidential and only used indirectly in feedback on his performance. This is, of course, optional on your part."
"219317028-0-1803";"Little Chief Laumont say Urbek have to smash you letter thanking you for your patronage and that it only because of generosity of patrons like you that Urbek get opportunity to study at prestigious institution like Four Irons. Urbek also supposed to ask you for donation to educational fund. Urbek send it soon."
"219317028-0-1804";"Urbek thank you for your patronage. It only because of patrons like you that Urbek get to study at prestigious institution like Four Irons Smeltery. Urbek hope you donate to education fund so that others like Urbek can get same opportunity."
"219317028-0-1805";"Don't worry, Urbek not really care if you donate to Four Irons. Urbek sure you already pay enough for Urbek to send you things for smashing. Urbek do hope you are smashing best you can smash."
"219317028-0-1806";"Urbek get letter back from home. Clan Tumnosh proud of Urbek, they know it must be hard to learn good smithing from such a tiny man, but it help Orc children get early start."
"219317028-0-1807";"Urbek not only one having hard time. Clan mates say they have problem with skinny Elf that visit quarry and cause lots of Dwarf things to attack. Clan says Dwarf things act alive, but made of metal. Sounds like magic, but Urbek not know much about that."
"219317028-0-1808";"Good smith, has Urbek expressed anything unusual to you in his correspondence? He has been extremely distracted at the forge and not in his usual curious manner. I've had to discipline him for nearly smashing my hand this afternoon and even that didn't seem important to him. The way the boy looks up to me, I assume there must be something afoot."
"219317028-0-1809";"Urbek conflicted. Letter left Urbek unsure if things okay with clan back at quarry, but clan mates not ask Urbek to return, so maybe problems already taken care of. Urbek have to think about it."
"219317028-0-1810";"Urbek talk to Farrokh about dilemma. He know a lot about Dwarf things it turn out. Farrokh say Dwarves experts in smashing and making things to do boring work for them. Urbek think Four Irons benefit from invention, but Urbek curious about potential."
"219317028-0-1811";"Urbek decide that Four Irons education not for Urbek. Urbek wish to pursue smashing books and there not much more to learn about that here. Urbek will return to Clan Tumnosh soon and share things learned, but Urbek mostly want to see Dwarf inventions."
"219317028-0-1812";"Apologies for the delay. Urbek's hasty withdrawal from his apprenticeship left me in a bind this morning as I redistributed his duties. I'll admit that this news doesn't come a complete surprise to me, but I had hoped the boy would persevere through his difficulties. Your remaining orders will be expertly fulfilled by my star pupil, Farrokh."
"219317028-0-1813";"I'm sure Urbek was under a lot of pressure to perform, being an Orc. The Orsimer's reputation for metalwork has been embellished to the point that it's unrecognizable from reality and most certainly an impossible standard for an impressionable youth to have to aspire to."
"219317028-0-1814";"In all likelihood Urbek was sent to us to give him some perspective, but perhaps the Laumont name was still too high a standard to approach as a novice. At least, as a novice with so many preconceived notions piled on his admittedly broad shoulders."
"219317028-0-1815";"I would like to note for the record that despite the Four Irons' liberal admission criteria for apprentices, our graduation rate is nearly one hundred percent. In the rare cases of withdrawal it is almost certainly due to extenuating circumstances. Had Urbek chosen to remain with us, I can promise we'd have made a first rate smith out of him."
"219317028-0-1816";"Greetings, patron. This is Farrokh. It is my duty to take over your service in Urbek's place. The void he has left is a large one, but I will do my best to fill it. I will not disappoint his trust in me, nor your high standards."
"219317028-0-1817";"I'm certain that Urbek would want you to know that he greatly enjoyed the work he did for you. It might not have seemed like he liked it here, but it was through corresponding with you his particular genius came to light. I can only hope you will be similarly inspiring to me, though I can't imagine what I would be if I were not a smith."
"219317028-0-1818";"My family cannot claim to have pursued the craft so long as Master Laumont, but the sword and the hammer have been a part of our lineage for some time. I will admit I was tempted to follow Urbek on his journey of discovery, but I am not the free spirit he is. When I return to my father's forge, it will be to take root."
"219317028-0-1819";"Forgive me, I am not usually so forthcoming, but I felt our common acquaintance makes us closer kin than the time we've been speaking would indicate. And truth be told, I miss my friend."
"219317028-0-1820";"Patron, this is likely not something you wish to hear from a professional plying their trade, but for the first time I'm beginning to doubt my path. I've always done what was expected of me, but I've never questioned whether this is what I want for myself."
"219317028-0-1821";"I'm leaving. I thought you should know. I have to see what else is out there, in the world. Perhaps I will find that path was always the correct one, but I don't wish to wonder what could have been if I'd thought to try another. I leave for Wrothgar tonight and I hope Urbek will still be there. It was my pleasure to serve, brief as it was."
"219317028-0-1822";"Good smith, my deepest apologies. Farrokh withdrew from his apprenticeship this morning. You didn't say anything to him that he might have misconstrued as a criticism, did you? He's always been so humble, I can't imagine he'd have taken anything you volunteered to heart. I'll supply you from our stores for the remainder of your contract."
"219317028-0-1823";"I hate to say it, but I think Urbek was a bad influence on Farrokh. I can't think of any other reason why such a dutiful student would suddenly throw away years of hard work. One bad apple spoils the bunch. Perhaps I have been too liberal in accepting apprenticeships."
"219317028-0-1824";"I know the Laumont name and Four Irons' reputation won't be affected by the delinquency of a very miniscule number of drop outs. It's the wasted potential that grieves me most. Farrokh would have been a master in his own right in a handful of years, and Urbek could have been the first Orc to bear the coveted Laumont trademark. Such a tragedy."
"219317028-0-1825";"Some good has come of all this. I have repaired the ancestral anvil that Urbek damaged and left my own mark upon the Four Irons. When my great-great-grandsons tell our customers of the grand Laumont history they may speak of this with pride and a touch of amusement."
"219317028-0-1826";"As much as I love to establish a great rapport with each of my customers, I must attend to my remaining apprentices' evaluations and, of course, the ever growing stack of applications for apprenticeships at the Four Irons. There will be good news for at least two of the aspiring smiths in the stack."
"219317028-0-1827";"Urbek greet you and sorry not to smash you letter since leaving suddenly. Urbek has been busy with family. Clan Tumnosh problems with Dwarf things not all bad. Urbek smash a few apart and then smash them into prototype. Urbek smash you this letter with it."
"219317028-0-1828";"Prototype smash letters fine, but it best for smashing lots of copies of one page over and over. When Urbek finished smashing plates for book on smashing, Urbek smash first book with prototype. Once method perfected, Urbek expect high demand for wordsmithing."
"219317028-0-1829";"Urbek have long road ahead, but he have good company. Farrokh come looking for Urbek and decide to help with new venture. We not forget our first patron when wordsmithing take off. Anytime you think you need words smashed, Urbek take care of you. Wish us luck."
"219317028-0-1830";"Greetings, new patron! We at Velothril Sisters have purchased your contract from Melina Cassel. It is our aim to provide you with the same outstanding level of service. Though we have included our first delivery, we sent our employee Valgus into the field to recover material which will supplement your enchanting."
"219317028-0-1831";"Valgus the Barrow-breaker, at your service. It is my goal to provide you a wide variety of quality enchanting material, pulled straight from the resting places of those who no longer need it. Soon I travel to recover material from an untouched Ayleid ruin. Until then, enjoy something from my private stock."
"219317028-0-1832";"Valgus again. Though I do provide enchanting material, I assure you it is only ever from the long-dead and the much-hated, such as Ayleid flesh-warpers and followers of the Dragon priests. If they passed in this era, I leave them be. (Worm Cultists are an exception. But I do wash the blood off.)"
"219317028-0-1833";"I, Valgus, have arrived at a remote Ayleid ruin located by the Velothril Sisters and scouted by a previous employee. I am fully prepared for whatever dangers may lurk within, be they ghost, creature, or bandit. Tomorrow I will send you the first of many deliveries culled from the ruin. I look forward to sharing what I pull from within!"
"219317028-0-1834";"With great regret, we at Velothril Sisters must inform you of the demise of our employee, Valgus. Please accept this delivery from our reserve. We have assigned our employee Gaereleth to handle your account from this point forward. We offer our apologies for this inconvenience."
"219317028-0-1835";"Hail! I'm Gaereleth Surefoot, a rune diver from Valenwood. The Velothril Sisters reassigned me, so it's good to be working for you. I understand there was an issue with your previous hireling, something about a failure to deliver? Fear not, I'm told there's an untouched Ayleid ruin ripe for the picking. I'll have those runestones to you shortly!"
"219317028-0-1836";"Gaereleth here. Rune diving is a lost art, but it requires a staunch commitment to the Green Pact. You travel along the graht-oak boughs at night. When you spot a runestone glimmer, you drop down by vine, pry it out, and ascend, all without touching the ground. The Green Pact does many things well, but driving away spirits isn't one of them."
"219317028-0-1837";"It's Gaereleth. My instructions were to enter an untouched Ayleid ruin scouted out by a previous employee. I don't have much to go on regarding the interior, but I've brought plenty of vines and sap glue. Fasten enough of them to the ceiling and I'll be able to travel above the empty heads of any skeletal guardians. Rune diving at its best!"
"219317028-0-1838";"With great regret, we at Velothril Sisters inform you of the demise of our employee, Gaereleth. Please accept this complimentary delivery from our reserve. Due to the recent irregularities in your service, we have assigned our most trusted employee Sixul to your account. Again, we offer our profound apologies for this inconvenience."
"219317028-0-1839";"I greet you, patron. My compatriots call me Sixul the Thorough. Velothril Sisters recalled me from Black Marsh to assign me as your hireling. They weren't particular regarding the circumstances, but said they required someone with my particular skills to manage your contract. And a promotion. Call me Sixul the Exceptionally Thorough, if you wish."
"219317028-0-1840";"It is Sixul. According to my instructions, my first task is to rendezvous at an Ayleid ruin. It was apparently discovered by a former employee, of whom Velothril Sisters has provided no details. The entire matter seems ill-advised so I shall research the ruin before setting out. Please, accept this delivery from my private stock."
"219317028-0-1841";"Sixul again. I plan to seek out the local Mages Guild for additional information regarding the Ayleid ruin. I am not a member myself. All they seem to care about these days is locating books that presumably careless Mages Guild members left in remote places. I have no desire to become a glorified librarian's apprentice to forgetful magicians."
"219317028-0-1842";"A minor difficulty. I presented myself to the local Mages Guild as Sixul the Exceptionally Thorough. When I said I worked for Velothril Sisters, the magister gained the same look on her face as most dryskins do when I explain Argonian mating rituals. I was escorted from the premises and told not to return. Of course, I will ignore this suggestion."
"219317028-0-1843";"I have a plan to gain access to the Mages Guild. I purchased a robe to conceal my distinctive scale patterns and elegant crest. I will return and present myself as Hunts-For-Books, an initiate from Black Marsh. (Without practice, most dryskins have difficulty distinguishing unique Argonian voices. I take no offense. Truly, I prefer the anonymity.)"
"219317028-0-1844";"My plan to access the Mages Guild went swimmingly. This is an Argonian joke. Did you enjoy my attempt at levity? No matter. I found a promising book on Ayleid ruins. More promising, there is a lock on the book. Most promising was the note stating it should not be sold to a Velothril Sisters employee. In accordance with their wishes, I borrowed it."
"219317028-0-1845";"The Mages Guild realized their locked book on Ayleid ruins went missing. I am technically fleeing. Please accept this hastily prepared delivery."
"219317028-0-1846";"When pursued by hostile creatures in Black Marsh, one hides in the depths of the swamps. Yet I am not currently in Black Marsh, and the hostile creature pursuing me is an irate Mages Guild magister, so I went where she was unlikely to follow: the foulest sewer in town. I have emerged briefly to send your delivery. I suggest you wash the contents."
"219317028-0-1847";"The magister caught my scent. Because I was in the sewer, you see? No matter. I returned to the sewer, where I stumbled upon a loose collection of people. I am assured they are fine, upstanding citizens who specialize in an alternative form of shipping. In fact, one was willing to deliver your goods. (But please inform me if anything is missing.)"
"219317028-0-1848";"It is not just alternative shipment I found available in this sewer refuge. It seems there are freelance locksmiths as well, so I availed myself of one such entrepreneur. He will open the locked book I borrowed from the Mages Guild, regarding the Ayleid ruin. Until then, please accept additional deliveries from my private stock."
"219317028-0-1849";"I confess to some amount of confusion. The Mages Guild book, the one they explicitly wished to keep from anyone connected with Velothril Sisters, has absolutely no mention of the Ayleid ruin where Velothril Sisters directed me. The book was written long after the Ayleids disappeared from Tamriel. But how does an entire Ayleid ruin disappear?"
"219317028-0-1850";"Please accept this hasty delivery. It seems I am being hunted! The magister has placed a bounty on me for borrowing an ultimately useless Mages Guild book. I ask your pardon for wrapping the delivery in my own wanted posters, but I had already torn down so many of them, and I am not the kind of person to let things go to waste."
"219317028-0-1851";"In the sewers, it seems you can truly find gold amidst the muck. The alternative shipper who has steadfastly delivered your packages asked after my particular inconvenience. When I explained my troubles with the Mages Guild, my new ally proposed a different sort of shipment out of town: me! Soon I shall be free to pursue my original task."
"219317028-0-1852";"If you have never hidden within a bale of hay on a moving cart, allow me to share my thoughts. First, it is extremely uncomfortable. The hay above you leaves no cushion against the cart's juddering on unstable roads. Next, hay is stiff and painful--enough to scratch the thickest scales. Finally, it's worth it if the trip ends with your freedom."
"219317028-0-1853";"Today I bid a fond farewell to my alternative shipping friend. While consulting the temporarily borrowed Mages Guild book, I found mention of a separate Ayleid ruin within a day's journey. Perhaps it can shed light on the original Ayleid ruin the Velothril Sisters assigned me to investigate. Shed light, as in Welkynd stones, you see? No matter."
"219317028-0-1854";"I found the second Ayleid ruin near a small river. (I will refer to it as the River Ruin so it is not confused with the first, missing ruin. Ah, the Missing Ruin! It names itself.) Unfortunately, I was unable to enter the River Ruin. There are nearly a dozen individuals encamped within. All well-armed. Tomorrow, I will seek to learn who they are."
"219317028-0-1855";"The individuals camped in the River Ruin are most certainly bandits. They seem quite complacent and carry open bottles of wine more often than weapons, which means they recently found their way into a large amount of gold. In such a state of mind, it should be no trouble to slip past them and into the River Ruin."
"219317028-0-1856";"I have been seized by the River Ruin bandits. They were quite alert for complacent drunks. When I realized none of them can read, I convinced them this delivery is a hostage request sent to my benefactor. Have no fear, I am called Sixul the Exceptionally Resourceful for a reason. I will soon figure a way out of this unfavorable situation."
"219317028-0-1857";"The bandits who captured me have agreed to pass this along as another ransom request to a second imaginary benefactor, should the first fail to provide payment. Greed can be a useful motivator. The prospect of free gold without the need to do bandit work has intrigued them. Incidentally, please note how committed I am to completing my deliveries."
"219317028-0-1858";"The bandits don't consider me a threat, so I am free to wander the River Ruin. I found five etched panels which clearly depict Ayleid ruins from the Mages Guild book. A sixth panel had been scored clean, with the exception of a stylized Ayleidoon word. I took an etching for later. (Assuming this third imaginary ransom request reaches you.)"
"219317028-0-1859";"Last night, as I pretended to sleep, someone placed a cloak over my head and a dagger at my back. I was told to keep quiet and move quickly, which was rather difficult in the dark. Yet somehow, we departed the River Ruin without alerting the bandits. It seems she is a passing adventurer who noticed my predicament. I am saved!"
"219317028-0-1860";"I am not saved. The adventurer is actually a bounty hunter, looking for me. I believe she was hired by the Mages Guild, but she has not been forthcoming. I admit to some surprise when she allowed this delivery, provided she read the message I sent along with it. Though I am not saved, I do appear safe. For the moment."
"219317028-0-1861";"Today the bounty hunter interrogated me regarding the Missing Ruin. She primarily asked me to retrace my footsteps. I thought it strange she didn't react when I showed her the borrowed Mages Guild book. She plans to send a letter to her masters, and has graciously agreed to pass along this delivery to you."
"219317028-0-1862";"The bounty hunter works for Velothril Sisters! She was hired to track me down if I had not entered the Missing Ruin by a certain date. Now, she is to remain in my company until I successfully retrieve the enchanting material. A bodyguard, of sorts. A bounty guard, you see? No matter. (The phrase made her curl her lip at me.)"
"219317028-0-1863";"I finally learned my bounty guard's name is Eron Salt. It took much questioning on my part for her to even share that. She is not what I would call a converastionalist, especially about herself. Before her arrival I traveled alone. If she doesn't care to speak, I shall continue to travel effectively alone. She'll have to get used to my humming."
"219317028-0-1864";"Having learned all I can from the River Ruin, my next step is to translate the Ayleidoon word found within. Perhaps it can reveal vital information about the Missing Ruin. I certainly hope so, as my enchanting materials are rapidly dwindling. Have no fear, I will find an alternate source if needed. A contract is binding, after all."
"219317028-0-1865";"I fought a troll! That is to say, Eron Salt fought the troll while I drank a potion of invisibility and  called out its weak spots. It was surprisingly effective, and she seems to look at me in a new light. Just this morning, her nod was respectful rather than sarcastic. Now we hunt for the troll's lair."
"219317028-0-1866";"Upon investigation, I am not at all surprised the troll attacked Eron Salt and myself. Within its lair were hundreds of smashed potion bottles and various magical accoutrements. It seems this troll had a taste for the enchanted! Thankfully, there were enough materials recovered from the detritus to restore my stock. Don't mind the troll fur."
"219317028-0-1867";"Arrived in a small village today. The locals were delighted to learn we'd killed the troll that has been eating the traveling peddlers. They informed us of a local mage who would be most appreciative to learn of this, for it seems his orders have gone unfulfilled. Tomorrow we set out for his home. Perhaps he knows Ayleidoon?"
"219317028-0-1868";"Davamin, the mage who lives in the troll-harassed village, was skeptical when I introduced myself as an employee of Velothril Sisters. Though he couldn't place the name, he was certain my employers had a poor reputation. (He put this more rudely than I describe.) Eron Salt suggested his body forcefully house the entirety of her boot. (As did she.)"
"219317028-0-1869";"I mollified the prickly mage Davamin, despite Eron Salt's protestations. I suggested she camp outside the village while I plied Davamin with sweet talk. When that failed, I tried his sweet tooth. I'd noticed the various candies scattered about his laboratory, so gifting him with a particularly delicious Black Marsh slug taffy secured a meeting."
"219317028-0-1870";"According to Davamin, the lettering I sketched while amidst my bandit captives is indeed an Ayleidoon word. The letters form the word Hecul and roughly translate to outcast. The Missing Ruin is really the Outcast Ruin? The Ayleid have a harsh reputation. What could possibly have caused them to erase their own from their records?"
"219317028-0-1871";"Despite my offer of monthly taffy delivery, Davamin could provide no further information on Hecul, the Outcast Ruin. He did write a letter of introduction to Prior Velan, whose clerk's mark graced the book on Ayleid ruins I long ago borrowed from the Mages Guild. If he made the manuscript's copy, he may have access to the original."
"219317028-0-1872";"Prior Velan refuses to speak with us. The brothers at the priory have gently but firmly requested we depart, and Eron Salt wants nothing more than to get moving. She thinks priests are bad luck, as they're always near the dying. When I suggested they best know how to care for them, she threatened to tongue-tie me. I did not press the issue."
"219317028-0-1873";"At great haste, and with the aid of the rarely talkative and always scowling Eron Salt, I returned to the Outcast Ruin. Velothril Sisters is contractually obligated to recover the enchanting material within nine weeks, and tomorrow is the last day. I would prefer more time to prepare, of course. Finding more questions than answers isn't reassuring."
"219317028-0-1874";"Today I enter Hecul, the Outcast Ruin. I will fulfill the letter of my contract, which is to recover one crate of rare enchanting material. I have potions at hand and convinced Eron Salt to lend me her dagger, which bears its own enchantment. I am Sixul the Thorough, and I have done everything I can to succeed on your behalf. Abavarlor."
"219317028-0-1875";"We at Velothril Sisters were disheartened to learn of the demise of our employee, Sixul. We hope this complimentary delivery can allay the inconvenience. We are currently reviewing the most capable employee to continue with your account. Until then, we leave you in the capable hands of Valyne Hlan, the procurer who stocks our personal reserves."
"219317028-0-1876";"This is Valyne Hlan with Velothril Sisters. Formerly with Velothril Sisters. The enclosed delivery was one of theirs. I will explain shortly, but for now I must escape the city."
"219317028-0-1877";"I'm safe. May the Three shelter me from the retribution of Velothril Sisters. Their purses are deep and their tolerance for disloyalty is minimal. It is madness for me to cross them. Yet I cannot allow them to feed another colleague to that accursed Ayleid ruin!"
"219317028-0-1878";"Before proceeding, I must be clear where we stand. Though I departed from Velothril Sisters with much haste, and I did so with a large amount of enchanting material, it was all earmarked for you, an existing client. As long as your planned deliveries continue, I am doing nothing illegal. (Which is what I'll tell the Guard, should they arrest me.)"
"219317028-0-1879";"I must keep off the roads. Did you know Velothril Sisters pays dozens of innkeepers a fee to report on the movements of their employees? It's true, I've seen the reports. Why does a middling procurement business need to spy on its own people? How can they afford to do so?"
"219317028-0-1880";"I arrived at a village with little trust for outsiders. They've grown used to my visits through the years. I wouldn't say they trust me, but they will keep me hidden for a handful of gold. Also, they make a delicious bean curd. I can't expose the darkness beneath the surface of Velothril Sisters on an empty stomach."
"219317028-0-1881";"I owe you an explanation, along with your latest shipment. I worked as a Velothril Sisters procurer for eight years. Though they deliver enchanting material for those such as yourself, the contracts fund their true interests: acquiring dangerous relics from the far corners of Tamriel. For what purpose? I don't know. But it can't be a good one."
"219317028-0-1882";"Velothril Sisters have no real enemies, but in their hunt for forbidden relics they certainly haven't made friends. Their fixation on Hecul, the Outcast (or Missing) Ruin is baffling. My best hope is to find someone who holds Velothril Sisters in low esteem and work to expose them. And pray to the Three, of course. That goes without saying."
"219317028-0-1883";"An armed woman arrived in the village, asking about me. The gold she offered for information was less than what I paid the villagers for silence, so for now I'm safe. It must be one of the bounty hunters Velothril Sisters keeps on retainer. At least it isn't Eron Salt. I hear that woman is relentless."
"219317028-0-1884";"The bounty hunter was, in fact, Eron Salt. She'll soon return with enough gold to bribe the villagers. If I'm to remain a free woman, I must flee. Fear not, the truth is on my side!"
"219317028-0-1885";"The truth may be on my side, but the weather is certainly not. The rains should throw Eron Salt off my trail. I hope."
"219317028-0-1886";"I stumbled across a Nereid today, amidst the rain. I don't know which of us was more surprised. I was still frozen in place as she curled her lips back. She aimed to tear my throat out, I'm sure of it. But then she pointed at me, shrieked in fear, and fled for her watery life. I am not an imposing person. Why would she do such a thing?"
"219317028-0-1887";"Fearful nereids aside, I stumbled across an abandoned hut not far from the road. I can hide from bounty hunters, stay out of the rain, and consider how best to expose Velothril Sisters. After I wring the entire Abecean Sea from my clothes."
"219317028-0-1888";"It is settled. I'll seek out the mage Davamin, the taffy-appreciating mage who is no friend to Eron Salt. Sixul's private reports about his travels suggested Davamin knew more about the Outcast Ruin than he let on."
"219317028-0-1889";"Davamin is dead! A few weeks ago he was found in his home, his throat sliced open, and his vocal cords done up like a bow on a package. It must have been Eron Salt. Isn't that fate what she wished of him?"
"219317028-0-1890";"Please don't think less of me, but I broke into Davamin's laboratory. I recovered his journal, but have no time to read it. His fellow villagers may have spotted me as I slipped from the lab. I write this from their own stables, allowing me to slip your material into the delivery pouch. I believe I have thrown off their trail."
"219317028-0-1891";"I was wrong. I am still being chased by angry villagers. Must run."
"219317028-0-1892";"I stumbled into a cave full of old rubbish. Broken bottles, a terrible smell, and signs of scavenging. This must be the troll lair Sixul and Eron Salt picked clean of materials. They killed the troll, so it's safe for me to rest and review Davamin's journal. At least for the moment."
"219317028-0-1893";"Other than a surprising amount of prurient gossip about the village smith, Davamin's journal contains very little information beyond alchemical notations and notices to restock. I sit here in a dank, dark cave with the pungent odor of troll offal filling my nostrils. My brother would say it is the scent of poor decisions. I can't disagree."
"219317028-0-1894";"Success! I used a thimble of blue-colored oil and some agitating oxide to create a mage's wick, a candle-sized flame that burns a bright white-blue for days. While it burned, I noticed some white-blue ink in the margins of Davamin's journal. He must have used ink to hide his thoughts in plain sight! Now, to investigate."
"219317028-0-1895";"Davamin's hidden journal entries spoke of the meeting with Sixul and Eron Salt. The next entry seemed increasingly worried about the meeting Sixul, based upon additional readings. All entries after that repeat the same word, dozens upon dozens of times: Abavarlor. It sounds Ayleidoon, but what could it mean?"
"219317028-0-1896";"If Eron Salt seeks my trail in remote villages, the city where I started is the safest place to travel. I'm also running low on food. (And I refuse to eat mushrooms that grew in troll dung.)"
"219317028-0-1897";"I found a use for the troll dung mushrooms. You can trade them to shipboard apothecaries for use as ipecacs. In trade, I rented a hammock aboard his captain's moored ship until the day they set sail. Thankfully, Velothril Sisters does not bribe the dockmaster to watch the port. Hard to compete with the purses of Alliance spies."
"219317028-0-1898";"I approached the Mages Guild. Sixul mentioned their dislike of Velothril Sisters, but I am cautious to mention the name until I know why. I made an appointment for tomorrow with one of their guild members who is fluent in Ayleidoon. Perhaps he knows what abavarlor means. I could swear I've heard that name before."
"219317028-0-1899";"I'm back at the ship, apparently safe. It appears the Mages Guild doesn't bribe the dockmaster either. Now to consider my next course of action. Also, to wring out my hair. I had to hide in a barrel of pickled perch, and since my return I have received nonstop innuendo from the Khajiiti boatswain. Most of it is crude, but some is almost poetic."
"219317028-0-1900";"The Little Scrapper set sail today, and I with it. Velothril Sisters bounty hunters, Mages Guild adepts ... who shall pursue me next? Khajiiti boatswains excluded, of course. (Even the clever ones.)"
"219317028-0-1901";"Abavarlor was the last word in Sixul's final update to Velothril Sisters. I remembered it this morning--nearly fell out of the boatswain's hammock. At the time I thought it was an Argonian farewell, or perhaps a prayer for luck. There's no source for this beyond Davamin, and Sixul certainly didn't gain access to his journal. Then how did he know?"
"219317028-0-1902";"I know my path. I must find Prior Velan, the skittish monk visited by Sixul. He knew more of the Outcast Ruin than he let on. I'm tired of being chased and I want answers. If he doesn't share, I'll force it from him. I don't fear retribution from his false gods."
"219317028-0-1903";"I temporarily own a horse. An old nag, rented for a fortnight. She won't get me to Prior Velan any faster than walking, but I'd rather wear out the seat of one pair of breaches than the soles of my only boots."
"219317028-0-1904";"You may wonder why I document my travels. You are insurance, of a sort. If I'm captured, I know of a substantial cache of runestones and can trade its location for your help in escaping. And if I suffer the same fate as my old colleagues? You'll have a record to bring to the Mages Guild, your Alliance, or someone who will take note. That's my hope."
"219317028-0-1905";"No luck at the priory. The brothers insist Prior Velan is not to be disturbed. They said it was an illness, but those smug, cassocked s'wits are poor liars. From Sixul's account, Prior Velan copied the original book on Ayleid ruins for the Mages Guild. He must have seen what was written about the Outcast Ruin. I won't be denied this knowledge."
"219317028-0-1906";"I abducted Prior Velan. Good thing I paid attention when Gaereleth Surefoot showed us how to properly toss a grapnel. I brought him to a hunter's cabin--it's remote, and unused this time of year. He hasn't made a sound since I captured him, but he will. This hunter's cabin has hunter's tools. Also? A hook to hang the quarry."
"219317028-0-1907";"It happened so fast. Prior Velan tore himself down from the hook and forced his way from the cabin. He kept shrieking abavarlor as I chased him, growing more and more distressed. Then he leapt headfirst into a ravine. Didn't even lift his hands. Said one word as he fell: Free. Then he dashed his brains against the rocks at the bottom."
"219317028-0-1908";"I'm tired. I'm scared. It feels as though I'm being watched, but I'm fairly certain that's all in my head. Tomorrow I begin my journey back to the city. I'll go directly to the Mages Guild and insist they explain why they care so much about a book that says nothing. I don't care what happens. I just want to know what this is about."
"219317028-0-1909";"My name is Eron Salt. Valyne Hlan is in my custody. She said she sent you letters. I need to know what she told you about Hecul. No need to write me, I will find you."
"219317028-0-1910";"Something is abavarlor. Contact abavarlor Sisters immediately. Do not allow Valyne abavarlor to proceed. She abavarlor more than she knows. Help. I'm losing abavarlor. Abavarlor."
"219317028-0-1911";"abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor abavarlor"
"219317028-0-1912";"Eron Salt is dead. I watched her unravel before me, like someone had plucked at a thread in a knit cap and tugged until there was nothing but a pile of string. She didn't call out. She just stood there, repeating abavarlor until her jaw was thin strips of bone and gore on the ground. I freed myself from the hook, but I don't know what to do next."
"219317028-0-1913";"I think I'm responsible for Eron Salt's death. Before it began, she kept muttering abavarlor, over and over. I told her she was coming apart at the seams--and a few hours later, she did. How does that make sense? If I could decide someone's fate with my voice, my old landlord would have long since buggered himself to death."
"219317028-0-1914";"I buried Eron Salt today. I wasn't sure how her people did it, what words they say. But I know enough about vengeful spirits to avoid creating new ones."
"219317028-0-1915";"Eron Salt's fate matched what I said to her. This isn't the first time someone's words resulted in someone's death. Davamin annoyed Eron Salt, and it appears her offhand wish for his demise came true. It's as if they were covered in kindlepitch, and the wish for their death was a lit torch. If words throw the torch, what spreads the kindlepitch?"
"219317028-0-1916";"The curse must be a Daedric. Some sort of knowledge trap. The more you learn, the closer you come to peril--like a blind kwama approaching a source of great warmth, not realizing it's a volcano's lip. Once you're over the lip, you fall until another's ill-spoken words burn you to ash. You survive by avoiding words. Life at a priory, perhaps?"
"219317028-0-1917";"I quit. I want nothing to do with this anymore. I'll flee somewhere remote and live a solitary life. Before that, I'll return everything I took from Velothril Sisters. If they want their souls to become Daedric playthings, so be it. As for you? I suggest you burn my letters and sever all contact with Velothril Sisters as soon as you are abavarlor."
"219317028-0-1918";"We at Velothril Sisters have learned of the most unprofessional conduct attributed to our former employee, Valyne Hlan. As she maintained deliveries to you throughout her ill-conceived expedition, our contract with you was not technically in violation. Therefore we shall personally see to all future deliveries. Your discretion is appreciated."
"219317028-0-1920";"This one is thinking about life's great unanswered questions. The greatest of these must surely be, 'What is in it for Zukki?' Your delivery is enclosed."
"219317028-0-1921";"Today was Naamah's turn to cook. She asked Zukki, 'Do you want some dinner?' 'What are Zukki's choices?' he asked. 'Yes or no,' she replied. Zukki is beginning to like her. This worries him."
"219317028-0-1922";"In all his travels, Zukki has learned many wise things. But the wisest of all is this: 'Often the best thing to do is nothing, and nothing is always a clever thing to say.' The young do not understand this. Zukki doesn't know why he keeps making mistakes if these kittens refuse to learn from them."
"219317028-0-1923";"Among the Khajiit, there is a saying. 'A true friend does not stab you in the back.' Zukki does not have many friends, but he is pretty sure that all of them would all stab him in the front."
"219317028-0-1924";"This one is having trouble sleeping. Last night he lay awake, staring at the stars, asking himself, 'Where has Zukki gone wrong?' Then he heard a little voice speak to him. The voice said, 'This is going to take more than one night.'"
"219317028-0-1925";"Khajiit have no sense of humor. A young one traveling with the caravan got put on limited rations because his mother said he was getting fat. So I said to her, 'You've got tubby kitten!' Khajiit have no sense of humor."
"219317028-0-1926";"This one wishes the other Khajiit would just leave him alone. Zukki swears, one day he will snap and strangle one of them. He is reminded of the old Khajiit saying, 'You can attract more flies with honey ... if you pour it over a dead body.'"
"219317028-0-1927";"Zukki was forcibly removed from a local tavern and told he should never come back. In his defense, the tavern had a sign that said, 'Wet Floor.' Here is your delivery."
"219317028-0-1928";"The caravan stayed in town last night so Zukki treated himself to a feather bed at the local inn. This one asked the innkeeper for a wake-up call. When he got to his room, there was a note on his pillow that read, 'You're not getting any younger, you know.' Zukki hates innkeepers."
"219317028-0-1929";"The caravan camped along the beach last night, and Zukki gathered mudcrabs for dinner. There are many ways to prepare a mudcrab, but this one just likes to yell, 'You are going to die!' before dropping them in the boiling water."
"219317028-0-1930";"Last night I showed Jossai my composite horn bow, given to me by my family before I left. She’s the woodworker I mentioned to you earlier. I worried she would find it wanting, but after a few moments inspection she simply plucked the bowstring, looked me straight in the eye, and asked, 'Khajiit gut?' She always knows how to make me laugh!"
"219317028-0-1931";"Apparently there’s a rumor going around that I’m courting Jossai! One of my traveling companions even dared to ask if her 'bedroll was to my liking.'  I’ve never been more insulted in my life! Not only is she older than my mother, she’s also a respected elder who has shown me a great deal of kindness. How dare they insult her like this!"
"219317028-0-1932";"One of my Wood Elf traveling companions refused to hunt with me today. He told me to go back to camp, as he did not want to 'lose Y’ffre’s protection' by accepting my help. I’ve never heard of something so absurd! I went to the other members of the camp for support, but they remained silent. Well if they won’t help, I’ll just hunt by myself."
"219317028-0-1933";"After departing Davamin's village, Eron Salt spoke more angry words about the mage than I've heard her say since we met. Most of them are filthier than the gutters of Windhelm, but 'I'll make a cravat from his windpipe' was particularly inspired. Then he would be tongue-tied, you see? Or perhaps twisting in the wind? No matter."
"219317028-0-1934";"We arrived at the priory. Upon reading Davamin's letter of introduction, Prior Velan went a particularly ashen shade of gray. When I asked what he knew of the Outcast Ruin, he shouted 'Speak not its name!' and bolted from his own office. He made signs to ward off evil as he fled. What does one do when one's host flees the room? (I finished my tea.)"
"219317028-0-1935";"I suspect I am riding a stolen horse. Eron Salt woke me before dawn, insisting I get on a piebald palomino I remember from the priory. The pommel had a stylized 'Prior Velan' sewn into the leather. When I informed my erstwhile companion, she scraped the stitching off and said I was mistaken. I find it best to agree when dealing with bounty hunters."
"219317028-0-1936";"Did you know Velothril Sisters isn't actually a trio of Dark Elf siblings? It was originally a Breton outfit hoping to gain access to relics in Dark Elf lands. The 'three sisters' were a shallow play on our culture's veneration of the Three. All of it calculated, all a false front."
"219317028-0-1937";"The Ayleidoon scholar informed me that 'abavarlor' roughly translates to 'forbidden symbol.' He seemed surprised at my inquiry, then grew suspicious. I made up a story regarding a relic I'd encountered in Cyrodiil, but as I excused myself he approached the magister. She signaled her adepts to take me into custody, so I fled."
"219317028-0-1938";"Why such interest in this Outcast Ruin, and why did Davamin's journal repeat the Ayleid word for 'forbidden symbol?' Could it mean 'forbidden text?' If so, 'abavarlor' most refers to Hecul, the Outcast Ruin's real name. But why did it appear in the first place?"
"219317028-0-1939";"Tomorrow the Little Scrapper makes port. Tonight I spend my last moments of relative calm with the Khajiit boatswain. I told him of the Nereid that fled from me, weeks ago, and he said they fear a curse greater than their own. When I asked what curse I bore, he said, 'the abrasive beauty of a driven woman.' I'll miss the scruffy sea cat."
"219317028-0-1940";"Prior Velan talked. I'm not proud of what I did to make that happen, but it was necessary. He kept saying 'thrice-written, once damned' and 'it comes for my words.' When I asked if he meant Hecul, he shrieked and began babbling. I couldn't make sense of it, half of what he said was 'abavarlor.' I've never seen someone so terrified."
"219317028-0-1941";"Prior Velan was most afraid of the Outcast Ruin's true name. 'Thrice-written, once-damned?' From my records, Sixul wrote it three times. Unless you count the etching he made from the River Ruin's walls. Does that count? I don't know how many times I've written it down. Two times? Three? Only in letters I sent. Do you still have them? Can you check?"
"219317028-0-1942";"Prior Velan said 'It comes for my words' and then would not stop saying 'abavarlor.' His own words became 'forbidden symbols,' replaced with that one Ayleid phrase. Davamin's journal entries kept repeating the word. Eron Salt's letters as well. Is it some sort of infection? Once it begins, does it signal your doom? Sounds like a curse of some kind."
"219317028-0-1949";"Greetings <<1>>!\n\nThe Circle of Champions has heard the rumors; gladiators shudder when they hear your name, the crowd roars when you enter the ring, the bards sing your praises after each match!

Through it all you have been the truest comrade I could ask for. \n\nI have never been good at talking about such things, so let me simply thank you with a token of our friendship. My old tutor Thierren gave me this medallion when I earned my staff. It depicts Julianos, patron of mages. I have always regarded him as my protector, and I hope he will watch over you as well. In years to come, let it remind you of our journeys together."
"219317028-0-2034";"I was talking with dad, telling him what I've been up to. It made me realize how much you and I have done since we crossed paths at that shattered doomvault. I think we've visited half the Daedric shrines and ruins in Tamriel. Not to mention all those dolmen.\n\nI want you to have this family heirloom. Traditionally, it's handed down from mother to daughter. My family isn't big on traditions, but we are sentimental. When mom gave it to me, I thought she was reminding me I wasn't getting any younger. But she told me to give it to the right person when I found them. I'm not sure what that means, but after all we've been through, I thought you should have it. As a remembrance of our adventures."

I'm told I'm supposed to offer you a good thank for giving the little mermaid a proper dunking, but I don't see what's so special about tossing minnows back where they belong. Next time you go fishing, catch something with some meat on its bones so we can have a right feast. Then, at least, I'd have reason to slap your back a bit. \n\nHere's what the Redbeard said I should send you. Enjoy it I guess.\n\n-Hroltar\nTranscription services rendered by Mathim"

"219317028-0-2061";"Hey so … you know I'm bad at this stuff. But just for you, I grabbed a quill and decided I'm writing down my feelings. Ugh, yuck. \n\nEver since that day at the tower, I've been watching you. Not in a creepy way, I swear! I've just been trying to understand. Why me? \n\nI still haven't figured it out. Most people get sick of me by now. But you haven't. And you also happen to be one of just a clawful of people, ever, to keep things interesting. That's pretty amazing.\n\nI tucked in a little gift. A joke, kinda. But when I saw it, it made my eyes go wide and my tail frizz up. And you do too. So. Here you go, or whatever.\n\n- Ember\n\nPS: Yes, I stole it. No, that doesn't make it any less special."
"219317028-0-2062";"You're my best friend. It seems trite to say, the stuff of adventure tales and romance novels, but it's true. I was once a girl with a wooden sword who wished to be a knight. \n\nNow? I'm sworn in service to a true hero, I've seen more of Tamriel than I ever thought I'd see. And you've helped me to be a better person … because I'm *not* that little girl anymore. And my relationships have grown alongside my friendship with you.\n\nA few days back, I slipped off and found … a gift for you. This silly, sacrilegious Stendarr candy jar is something I never would have known existed, if not for you. Let it be a symbol, filled with sweetness, of our companionship. \n\nYour friend,\n- Izzy"
"219317028-0-2065";"Idiots think the hardest battles are the melees of war. They don't know about the battles of the mind. Enemy forces double in size and never tire. They don't respect ceasefires and attack from the shadows instead of facing you on the battlefield honorably. For Ansuul the Tormentor to lend her power to this attack disrespects every code of combat! I don't care if the enemies you faced were your own, you have my admiration. \n\nTake this. Others may not recognize the struggle you underwent, but I see the toll it's taken. I am proud of your every campaign against this foe, ongoing and completed."

"219317028-0-2068";"I'll keep this short. I made you something. Carved it myself. The enchantment's pretty crude, but it's mine too. Been testing it out, and there's not a fishing spot in Tamriel or beyond where this won't have better fish biting faster. \n\nI prefer your company more than anyone else I've met in this world, but seasons change, and all roads diverge eventually. For when that happens, and you're in need of some solace on the end of a fishing line, I hope this helps.\n\nGood hunting (and fishing), \n\n-Sharp \n\nPS: The feather on it is one of mine. Sorry if that's weird. It's what I had on me when I was making it."
"219317028-0-2069";"Seeing beyond my own fateline was extraordinary, a rare and precious gift. As has your friendship, which has had a profound impact along a number of axes. My isolationist tendencies, my hyperfixation on arcane minutia, my rampant ear-hair.\n\nIn celebration of this happy perturbation of my life, I have procured for you a small offertory knick-knack. I contracted with a friend in Sentinel to make the included tea set, inscribed with specific arcanist runes and Apocryphal symbology. It should make exceptional brews and improve your long term health. Theoretically.\n\nYour colleague, \n- Azandar al-Cybiades"
"219317028-0-2070";"In all my time spent pouring over texts, I never considered that the pursuit of knowledge could take another form. I lived among the tomes and the Lurkers for many seasons, and it took meeting you for me to realize that not all knowledge can be gained through ink and paper. There is knowledge in action. I am, of course, referring to combat and your staunch defense of the Infinite Archive. It is not that I did not have a high opinion of you when we met, just that I expected you to be some blade-brained fool. I was wrong to judge you so harshly.\n\nTake this, with my thanks, and know that the Infinite Archive will welcome you the next time you feel the need to defend its halls."
"219317028-0-2071";"Despite the expanse of knowledge that exists across the realms, many mysteries and unknowns still plague an inquiring mind. The arcane knot, for example, whose origin and function are completely unknown. But thanks to you, we now have an opportunity to study it—or at the very least contain it so that its chaotic nature can be controlled. One of the scribes temporarily released the knot to see if it could be contained by a warding spell. His animus shattered. I don't know how long you were exposed to the knot, but I'm impressed.\n\nPlease take this. Only Hermaeus Mora knows what calamity your actions avoided by keeping the arcane knot out of Xoryn's control."

If you're a new homeowner and are wondering where you should start, I recommend that you visit the villa to explore it first! I left a book for you to read that gives you an overview of what you can do with your home.\n\nNext, I'd start with decorating:\n\n- Visit furnishing merchants throughout Tamriel. You can find Home Goods and Achievement Furnishers in each major town, for example.\n\n- Guilds often have furnishings for sale on their vendors.\n\n- Harvesting and fishing may help you uncover (or land) something just right for you.\n\nAnd that really is just the beginning.\n\nEnjoy your new home!"
