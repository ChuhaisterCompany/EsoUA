"66848564-0-974";"Incompetents! Idiots! How could they allow this to happen?"
"66848564-0-1294";"I'll have his heart!"
"66848564-0-1341";"Mauloch, grant me strength. Give me glory."
"66848564-0-1346";"Now it's time for you to finish them."
"66848564-0-1383";"The world is dark. My sweet wife is dead."
"66848564-0-1384";"Psst! You up for helping out a fellow adventurer?"
"66848564-0-1437";"We need everyone we can get."
"66848564-0-1485";"They took him! They took everyone!"
"66848564-0-1489";"Filthy Goblins stole my wine!"
"66848564-0-1536";"Fire! Help! Whoever you are … please help us save the Abbey!"
"66848564-0-1541";"Abbot Durak is cursed. We can't wake him up."
"66848564-0-1554";"Goblins! Goblins must pay!"
"66848564-0-1568";"Of all the boneheaded stunts …."
"66848564-0-1591";"There are wounded to tend to, but I'm wounded myself."
"66848564-0-1633";"The nightmare may be over, but there's still work to do."
"66848564-0-1637";"Here comes that stroke of luck I was counting on."

"66848564-0-1678";"Could you please untie me?"
"66848564-0-1687";"You there! In the name of the Knights of the Flame, I ask your assistance."
"66848564-0-1709";"Wait! Come back!"
"66848564-0-1735";"There is more for us to discuss. We must investigate this further."
"66848564-0-2016";"Well, well. A new arrival."
"66848564-0-2017";"It's been hard to tell friend from foe."
"66848564-0-2018";"The tides can still turn to our favor."
"66848564-0-2046";"Name of Azura! They got Master Muzgu!"
"66848564-0-2068";"If the dreugh attack again, we're all dead."
"66848564-0-2130";"This is not good. Really, just not good."

"66848564-0-2184";"They will pay for what they have done!"
"66848564-0-2187";"What if the heroes of legend have been raised?"
"66848564-0-2192";"Tu'whacca will send his Breath soon."
"66848564-0-2193";"Tu'whacca has great faith in you."

"66848564-0-2240";"I think I know where to find the third Ansei Ward."
"66848564-0-2251";"If there are more rats, then we will simply need more traps."

"66848564-0-2459";"The Midnight Union kidnaped my wife!"
"66848564-0-2479";"It claws at me from within. It wants to get out!"
"66848564-0-2487";"It was slaughter, pure and simple."
"66848564-0-2495";"It was a trap! They knew we would come."
"66848564-0-2521";"You want to make some gold, walker?"
"66848564-0-2522";"Hey! Over here. Could you help a fellow out?"
"66848564-0-2523";"Only the best for Lady Adima!"
"66848564-0-2524";"I just know Hosni's a victim in all of this."
"66848564-0-2525";"Now to save my son."

"66848564-0-2595";"You realize you're walking into a warzone?"
"66848564-0-2602";"Praise the Eight!"
"66848564-0-2613";"Halt! Go no further till you've spoken with me."
"66848564-0-2614";"You! Empty One! Heed my plea!"
"66848564-0-2616";"King Fahara'jad has no authority here!"
"66848564-0-2617";"At last, someone to help me."
"66848564-0-2620";"This is insane. I have committed no crime!"
"66848564-0-2622";"Lucas! Lucas! Can you hear me?"
"66848564-0-2625";"I'm sorry, do I know you? Why are you here?"
"66848564-0-2626";"Out of my way! I'm getting out of here!"
"66848564-0-2627";"I'm worried about Murk-Watcher."
"66848564-0-2630";"Remember—keep this quiet! Just between the two of us for now!"
"66848564-0-2634";"Sir Hughes should know about Dame Falhut's betrayal!"
"66848564-0-2635";"There's something we need to discuss … privately."
"66848564-0-2637";"The Three must not be allowed to wreak their violence again!"
"66848564-0-2643";"Sir Hughes will pay dearly for what he's done!"
"66848564-0-2647";"If you're willing, I might ask for one other favor?"
"66848564-0-2655";"If my orders didn't forbid it, we would certainly find out!"
"66848564-0-2656";"The Three must not be allowed to wreak their violence again!"
"66848564-0-3072";"Come to me, wayfarer."
"66848564-0-3077";"We need a way to root out the bandits."
"66848564-0-3078";"We need to do something."
"66848564-0-3083";"What's next? I can't wait! This is so exciting!"
"66848564-0-3084";"A moment, friend."
"66848564-0-3085";"Both King and Covenant are at risk today."
"66848564-0-3089";"Why has the forest turned against this place?"
"66848564-0-3090";"Stranger, this forest is cursed!"
"66848564-0-3091";"Twice-cursed pig thieves!"
"66848564-0-3093";"You aren't one of the villagers."
"66848564-0-3094";"Ah, my rescuer returns!"
"66848564-0-3098";"Nobody cares about us poor beggars."
"66848564-0-3099";"The more I learn, the less I like it."
"66848564-0-3105";"My regret binds me to this place."
"66848564-0-3109";"I wish I was more of a fighter. Those bastards might return at any moment."
"66848564-0-3112";"I found something important."
"66848564-0-3113";"The spirits of the dead haunt this place."
"66848564-0-3122";"The day I foresaw has finally arrived."
"66848564-0-3124";"Beware, stranger. The Bloodthorn cult prowls the Fens."
"66848564-0-3128";"Oh, poor Poppa …."
"66848564-0-3137";"Oh, my beloved. What you sacrificed for us all!"
"66848564-0-3143";"There was so many of them!"
"66848564-0-3144";"Help us. We can't resist much longer."
"66848564-0-3159";"Go now. Destroy the Bloodthorn threat."
"66848564-0-3160";"Be ready for anything!"
"66848564-0-3164";"There must be a way to win this fight. There has to be!"
"66848564-0-3184";"Finally! I was beginning to think help would never arrive."
"66848564-0-3209";"Oh gods, what have I done?"
"66848564-0-3270";"You may be safer in the desert than in Bergama, wayfarer."
"66848564-0-3280";"This is getting to be absurd!"
"66848564-0-3291";"The other refugees. They're still in danger."
"66848564-0-3300";"This isn't over yet."
"66848564-0-3304";"Now is the time. Ildani must act fast."
"66848564-0-3306";"Good to see that you're still alive."
"66848564-0-3307";"I will see the Withered Hand destroyed."
"66848564-0-3308";"The Wyrd Tree is dying."
"66848564-0-3309";"Don't kill me! I'm not your enemy!"
"66848564-0-3352";"The Wyrd Tree isn't safe yet."
"66848564-0-3383";"You certainly know how to make an impression."
"66848564-0-3394";"With the Midnight Talisman, we can finally take the battle to Angof."
"66848564-0-3395";"If this isn't the dumbest strategy I ever heard, I don't know what is!"
"66848564-0-3396";"I can't do it …."
"66848564-0-3397";"I never should've trusted that fool!"
"66848564-0-3398";"Is that the sound of battle I hear?"
"66848564-0-3400";"A new danger arises in the north."
"66848564-0-3406";"Now where has her ladyship gotten to?"
"66848564-0-3407";"Have heart Captain! The answer to your prayers has arrived!"
"66848564-0-3408";"This better not be another Montclair trick."
"66848564-0-3410";"I tell you, that ship was sent by Stendarr himself!"
"66848564-0-3428";"Those poor people in the mines …."
"66848564-0-3430";"Oh Lamae, when will I learn not to trust Stibbons? He's ruined everything!"
"66848564-0-3442";"Stranger! Aid me!"
"66848564-0-3443";"Dead! And without a scrap of treasure to my name!"
"66848564-0-3452";"I'm dead! And for what? For a book. A book!"
"66848564-0-3474";"All my choices go from bad to worse."
"66848564-0-3476";"I need to figure out how to deal with these Red Rook criminals."
"66848564-0-3477";"Over here. We have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-3483";"We're ready to strike back!"
"66848564-0-3485";"Sand covers all things given time."
"66848564-0-3486";"Please. The people of Crosswych need help."
"66848564-0-3487";"Someone has to stand up to these Red Rook villains."
"66848564-0-3488";"I'm not sure we can win this battle."
"66848564-0-3499";"Can fate be changed, I wonder?"
"66848564-0-3519";"There you are!"
"66848564-0-3533";"Fancy meeting you here."
"66848564-0-3535";"Business isn't what it used to be."
"66848564-0-3537";"How could this happen?"
"66848564-0-3539";"Someone needs to do something."
"66848564-0-3573";"This isn't what I had hoped for."
"66848564-0-3575";"You, there! A word, if you don't mind."
"66848564-0-3598";"Scourge thump those toothless runts!"
"66848564-0-3601";"Do you have a moment? It's worth your time."
"66848564-0-3603";"A little help over here!"
"66848564-0-3648";"My son is missing!"
"66848564-0-3669";"We have to stop her. Now."
"66848564-0-3670";"There is no way I can do this now without your help."
"66848564-0-3671";"These lands hold more mysteries than you can possibly imagine."
"66848564-0-3672";"O Ruptga who set the stars in the sky. Why? Why have you deserted me?"
"66848564-0-3674";"Psst, over here! You, there!"
"66848564-0-3686";"I dare another one of them to come closer!"
"66848564-0-3699";"More refugees! Where are they all coming from?"
"66848564-0-3703";"Welcome to the arse end of nowhere."
"66848564-0-3728";"Uela the Hagraven is the true evil here."
"66848564-0-3825";"I need to get to Shornhelm."
"66848564-0-3848";"Excuse me! I must see the King!"
"66848564-0-3873";"Praise Vivec! An ally. Help me, child."
"66848564-0-3876";"Covenant soldiers are waiting to the north. Tread carefully."
"66848564-0-3877";"Soldier! Urgency impels us. We must keep the Covenant from getting the Coral Heart."
"66848564-0-3878";"We need an edge in this fight."
"66848564-0-3880";"I need more time."
"66848564-0-3881";"They've scaled the walls!"
"66848564-0-3882";"We must return Balreth to his slumber."
"66848564-0-3883";"Where in Oblivion did these things come from?"
"66848564-0-3884";"Ahknara's legend ends here."
"66848564-0-3885";"The hearts of the Dunmer are as dry as their land."
"66848564-0-3886";"The hearts of Dunmer are as dry as their land."
"66848564-0-3887";"The hearts of the Dunmer are as dry as their land."
"66848564-0-3888";"The hearts of Dunmer are as dry as their land."
"66848564-0-3889";"Easy, Siphonix, easy."
"66848564-0-3891";"The river flows so slowly. Much slower than I remember."
"66848564-0-3892";"I'm worried. What's my brother done?"
"66848564-0-3895";"We must restore the balance."
"66848564-0-3897";"Give a girl a hand?"
"66848564-0-3899";"We need an edge in this fight."
"66848564-0-3901";"Here, kwama! Nice kwama. Please don't eat me!"
"66848564-0-3903";"That beautiful snow princess is in danger!"
"66848564-0-3904";"It's time to finish the Oathbound."
"66848564-0-3905";"My head! They cut off my head!"
"66848564-0-3909";"Covenant soldiers are waiting to the north. Tread carefully."
"66848564-0-3911";"There they are, the bastards."
"66848564-0-3912";"No screeching, spellcasting witch will best Norgred Hardhelm!  Ooooh … my head."
"66848564-0-3915";"I'm not a brave Argonian. I shouldn't be doing this."
"66848564-0-3917";"I must find him. I must."
"66848564-0-3918";"Hurry! You must go quickly!"
"66848564-0-3919";"My nightmares will be your playground, worm."
"66848564-0-3922";"Khajiiti defilers have ruined us!"
"66848564-0-3923";"My village—you must help!"
"66848564-0-3924";"It's not safe here!"
"66848564-0-3925";"Did you bring troops?"
"66848564-0-3926";"Soldier, to me!"
"66848564-0-3930";"My friends—captured by the Khajiit!"
"66848564-0-3933";"Run! Goblins have overrun our fields."
"66848564-0-3934";"Those Goblin beasts should suffer."
"66848564-0-3936";"Run. Goblins have overrun our fields."
"66848564-0-3939";"My guar, all gone!"
"66848564-0-3940";"I'm not going back. Jin-Ei can get them himself."
"66848564-0-3941";"Ah, finally! A change in the weather."
"66848564-0-3942";"We need to unbar the gates."
"66848564-0-3943";"To Sovngarde with him!"
"66848564-0-3944";"Tanval must be stopped!"
"66848564-0-3946";"The Omen has pulled Godrun into a deep sleep."
"66848564-0-3947";"Ah, finally! A change in the weather."
"66848564-0-3949";"Ah, you've arrived! There's much to do."
"66848564-0-3953";"Damn the ancients. And their hubris."
"66848564-0-3954";"There's more to do."
"66848564-0-3956";"Another stranger swims into our wallow."
"66848564-0-3957";"All of them!"
"66848564-0-3962";"Sniveling Khajiiti cowards!"
"66848564-0-3965";"I have a plan."
"66848564-0-3969";"What a terrible waste."
"66848564-0-3971";"Look, Varon. Here comes the outsider now."
"66848564-0-3972";"We have much to discuss, you and I."
"66848564-0-3974";"""Honor for the Pact,"" they says. ""Har de har har,"" I says!"
"66848564-0-3978";"You aren't one of my soldiers."
"66848564-0-3979";"So who's this, walking into the fortress?"
"66848564-0-3980";"It can't be. They wouldn't."
"66848564-0-3986";"Turn back, traveler. The pass is closed."
"66848564-0-3989";"You're not here to complain, are you?"
"66848564-0-3990";"Are you ready to commune with the Hist?"
"66848564-0-3991";"Why would someone steal from us?"
"66848564-0-3992";"What happened to our pilgrims?"
"66848564-0-3995";"Find anything interesting out there?"
"66848564-0-3996";"I can't take much more of this abuse."
"66848564-0-3997";"What's this? A visitor in <<1>>?"
"66848564-0-3998";"Will we ever feel safe again?"
"66848564-0-4000";"We must act now."
"66848564-0-4001";"Look at them, prancing about like the Emperor's heirs."
"66848564-0-4003";"I'll root out every cave in this swamp if I have to!"
"66848564-0-4005";"Soldier. Urgency compels us. We must keep the Covenant from getting the Coral Heart."
"66848564-0-4009";"What in Oblivion is the meaning of this?"
"66848564-0-4011";"Those dirty bastards!"
"66848564-0-4013";"Time to skin a cat."
"66848564-0-4014";"Ho, outlander!"
"66848564-0-4015";"I do love a good raid!"
"66848564-0-4018";"Get me out of here!"
"66848564-0-4019";"Quietly, there is danger!"
"66848564-0-4021";"They're burning alive in there, and I can't save them!"
"66848564-0-4022";"You don't look like a Maulborn."
"66848564-0-4026";"This is a damn disaster!"
"66848564-0-4030";"The fate of <<1>> must be decided."
"66848564-0-4032";"I can't believe I'm still alive!"
"66848564-0-4035";"Harken to me, stranger."
"66848564-0-4036";"Oh. no! My poor wasps!"
"66848564-0-4039";"The keystone … I remember it now!"
"66848564-0-4042";"You, there! I could use some help."
"66848564-0-4043";"So many medallions to gather."
"66848564-0-4045";"Have we been led into error?"
"66848564-0-4046";"These words are so final."
"66848564-0-4050";"Mind the wisps!"
"66848564-0-4051";"The Dominion should pay for their crimes."
"66848564-0-4053";"Shh! Stop making so much noise!"
"66848564-0-4055";"What's this?"
"66848564-0-4056";"Careful. There are necromancers about."
"66848564-0-4057";"I have my suspicions."
"66848564-0-4059";"Shore up the defenses on the path. We can't let those scamps off the mountain."
"66848564-0-4063";"The creature won't give up easily."
"66848564-0-4068";"Take these chains away!"
"66848564-0-4069";"You look like someone who can get things done."
"66848564-0-4072";"My crystal! They stole my crystal!"
"66848564-0-4073";"We've been expecting you."
"66848564-0-4079";"So, who's this now, walking into the fortress?"
"66848564-0-4082";"I'll never gamble again."
"66848564-0-4090";"Please! I need your help!"
"66848564-0-4094";"Hurry up and get me out!"
"66848564-0-4113";"I assure you—this looks worse than it really is."
"66848564-0-4114";"This stone was used to contain something. Possibly that Daedric fiend loose in these ruins."
"66848564-0-4116";"I hope he's still alive!"
"66848564-0-4123";"Stranger, may we speak?"
"66848564-0-4124";"Shh! Over here!"
"66848564-0-4129";"Hmm. Where could it be?"
"66848564-0-4130";"My arm .… Feels like it's shattered."
"66848564-0-4131";"Our temple is isolated. Who can aid us?"
"66848564-0-4138";"Hissmir must be notified about recent events in Murkwater."
"66848564-0-4140";"Look out! The swamp creatures have gone mad!"
"66848564-0-4148";"No, not Covenant."
"66848564-0-4149";"There's just too many of them."
"66848564-0-4150";"Be strong. Somebody has to do this."
"66848564-0-4152";"Such terrible slaughter!"
"66848564-0-4153";"Curse the Dominion. If only we had more agents."
"66848564-0-4154";"I know you want to help the Nord Cultural Exchange."
"66848564-0-4155";"Now the game gets really interesting."
"66848564-0-4162";"We're not being paid enough for this!"
"66848564-0-4166";"Traveler, over here! Don't enter Selfora!"
"66848564-0-4167";"Someone suffers. Help them."
"66848564-0-4169";"What will we do?"
"66848564-0-4173";"Shh! Don't attract their attention."
"66848564-0-4174";"It hurts so much …."
"66848564-0-4175";"Oh … it hurts."
"66848564-0-4177";"I'm over here."
"66848564-0-4179";"Hissmir must be notified about recent events in Murkwater."
"66848564-0-4187";"It seems we may be of aid to each other, after all."
"66848564-0-4192";"What's keeping that idiot? He should be back by now."
"66848564-0-4194";"A visitor? To the prison? How unusual."
"66848564-0-4195";"What promises must I keep?"
"66848564-0-4196";"Even dead, I cannot escape this prison."
"66848564-0-4198";"If only she were with the Hist …."
"66848564-0-4199";"I don't believe it!"
"66848564-0-4207";"My apprentice thinks he's the arch-mage of a college."
"66848564-0-4218";"Friend, a moment of your time?"
"66848564-0-4219";"My sister sneaks off into the ruins, and I wind up getting hurt. How typical."
"66848564-0-4228";"This is a damn disaster!"
"66848564-0-4229";"What in Oblivion is the meaning of this?"
"66848564-0-4234";"My holy place has been violated."
"66848564-0-4238";"The livestock's gone mad, and what does he do? Back into the mine, he goes. This isn't turning out well, at all. Not at all."
"66848564-0-4247";"Over here!"
"66848564-0-4252";"Good, good. We have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-4255";"Careful, traveler. Nasty pirates ahead."
"66848564-0-4256";"We've got a mystery to solve, here."
"66848564-0-4257";"We must get the second Fang of Sithis!"
"66848564-0-4259";"Watch it! You'll give me away."
"66848564-0-4267";"Oh, this is so exciting!"
"66848564-0-4270";"Golden Eye, open. Give us your blessing."
"66848564-0-4271";"At last, my vision clears!"
"66848564-0-4273";"Welcome to the council, oh my comrade."
"66848564-0-4279";"One moment. I'm trying to concentrate."
"66848564-0-4280";"Ready for your next task?"
"66848564-0-4281";"How can I work in these conditions? I'm a healer, not a miracle worker!"
"66848564-0-4282";"Why won't he speak to me?"
"66848564-0-4285";"It's past time you returned."
"66848564-0-4292";"This dark magic plagues us!"
"66848564-0-4295";"Why hasn't he come back?"
"66848564-0-4296";"Have you come to help us?"
"66848564-0-4297";"Stop! Trespasser! Halt right there."
"66848564-0-4298";"Hmm. Yes, that's just in line with the third law of arcanodynamics. Excellent."
"66848564-0-4303";"Careful, traveler. Shor's Stone is not safe today."
"66848564-0-4304";"Don't let them see you!"
"66848564-0-4307";"Get out while you still can! It's not safe here!"
"66848564-0-4308";"No, please. I can't take this anymore!"
"66848564-0-4311";"Don't worry. You're going to be okay."
"66848564-0-4314";"Halt, in the name of the King."
"66848564-0-4326";"Ware, traveler. The waters run wild and dangerous here."
"66848564-0-4346";"Ah, adept. A pleasure to see you again."
"66848564-0-4349";"One more thing, outsider."
"66848564-0-4352";"Damn her to the depths of Oblivion!"
"66848564-0-4353";"Narsis must hear of this."
"66848564-0-4354";"Damned nightmares couldn't keep their hands to themselves."
"66848564-0-4355";"Watch your flank, watch your flank!"
"66848564-0-4360";"We're doomed. Doomed!"
"66848564-0-4379";"Reach skeevers in my home. Bastards!"
"66848564-0-4382";"Greetings!"
"66848564-0-4384";"I'm supposed to find help here?"
"66848564-0-4390";"Stop them! Break this crystal!"
"66848564-0-4397";"It is good you have come, comrade."
"66848564-0-4400";"Who's there?"
"66848564-0-4405";"Auri-el, keep me safe. Auri-el, keep me strong."
"66848564-0-4429";"Perhaps that one can help."
"66848564-0-4430";"What a mess."
"66848564-0-4442";"My poor, poor village! My heart weeps for Lower Yorgrim."
"66848564-0-4446";"Damar! By the Eight, where are you?"
"66848564-0-4466";"I wish the others would return already."
"66848564-0-4478";"My poor Inga! I promise you, the Voljar name will not be forgotten."
"66848564-0-4480";"Blasted Stormfist cowards!"
"66848564-0-4486";"If only we had a few furs to keep us warm."
"66848564-0-4504";"Wait! Who's that? Who's over there?"
"66848564-0-4506";"Poor Lower Yorgrim. What a crying shame that's turned out to be."
"66848564-0-4507";"Droi's fever grows worse."
"66848564-0-4509";"Hello! Can I speak to you for a moment?"
"66848564-0-4510";"Ah! Fresh from the warm southern lands! You smell of salt and sunshine."
"66848564-0-4517";"Are you here to help?"
"66848564-0-4528";"Shor's bones, it's good to see you again!"
"66848564-0-4529";"You look competent."
"66848564-0-4536";"I hoped to spot you out here."
"66848564-0-4537";"Of all the things to steal…."
"66848564-0-4539";"Please! You have to help me!"
"66848564-0-4540";"You there! You're needed in Cyrodiil!"
"66848564-0-4541";"These cultists are everywhere"
"66848564-0-4542";"The King's champion returns!"
"66848564-0-4545";"What a beautiful day! We couldn't have asked for better weather for the festival."
"66848564-0-4548";"You!  Get me out of this filthy cage!"
"66848564-0-4549";"You don't look like one of Fildgor's mangy bunch."
"66848564-0-4550";"Over here, Champion."
"66848564-0-4551";"Slow down. That was the middle part."
"66848564-0-4552";"You there! You don't look like an abomination against the Divines."
"66848564-0-4557";"Help! Over here! I need you!"
"66848564-0-4561";"Over here, friend."
"66848564-0-4563";"Hail, stranger! You're just in time."
"66848564-0-4566";"Please. Help a dying old man. I beg of you."
"66848564-0-4567";"Help! Over here! I need you!"
"66848564-0-4572";"Please, help stop this madness!"
"66848564-0-4575";"Come on, Raynor. You can do this. You're a genius, after all."
"66848564-0-4576";"You don't look like a Dwarven construct."
"66848564-0-4580";"We'll never be able to thank you enough!"
"66848564-0-4582";"Ashlanders have tunneled under the walls!"
"66848564-0-4584";"Be welcome, friend."
"66848564-0-4587";"I won't take this lying down!"
"66848564-0-4588";"I've got a plan, but I'll need your help."
"66848564-0-4591";"Outsiders are not welcome here."
"66848564-0-4592";"Over here! Did the General send you?"
"66848564-0-4593";"Hurry, champion!"
"66848564-0-4594";"Beware, stranger. The dead walk the Crest."
"66848564-0-4596";"Come on over! These elves won't loot themselves."
"66848564-0-4600";"Help! Please!"
"66848564-0-4601";"Over here! Help!"
"66848564-0-4602";"Please, I need your help!"
"66848564-0-4604";"Look! A stranger approaches. This may be the chance we've been hoping for."
"66848564-0-4606";"I could use your help, friend."
"66848564-0-4607";"Anuiel guide me! My friends need rescue."
"66848564-0-4608";"<<1>> needs us."
"66848564-0-4609";"A pity I can't be in five places at once …."
"66848564-0-4611";"My Treva! He's gone. Gone!"
"66848564-0-4613";"If we don't get these mammoths under control …."
"66848564-0-4614";"One problem under control. On to the next."
"66848564-0-4618";"If only we had more hearts …."
"66848564-0-4621";"To Oblivion with every Worm!"
"66848564-0-4622";"Stay with me, soldier. The river will not take you today."
"66848564-0-4624";"I can't believe I've come this far and Silvenar is sealed against me!"
"66848564-0-4625";"Please, I need you! Come here, quickly!"
"66848564-0-4626";"By Y'ffre… Something is wrong. This cannot be."
"66848564-0-4627";"What? Who's there?"
"66848564-0-4628";"You're going to make it, soldier. Stay with me."
"66848564-0-4632";"It is time to party hearty!"
"66848564-0-4634";"Ready to begin?"
"66848564-0-4638";"The undead! Y'ffre save us!"
"66848564-0-4644";"Halt! Who goes there?"
"66848564-0-4645";"Stop, in the name of the king!"
"66848564-0-4646";"Just once, I'd like to live somewhere nice. Quiet."
"66848564-0-4648";"Why won't this thing write?"
"66848564-0-4652";"For Pact and glory!"
"66848564-0-4653";"Excuse me, celebrated hero! Could you spare a few minutes for a poor agent of the Pact?"
"66848564-0-4655";"Watch your flank, watch your flank!"
"66848564-0-4664";"Urgent message for you, comrade."
"66848564-0-4673";"I won't let them take grandfather's fortress."
"66848564-0-4674";"Quietly, the Reachmen are all over these hills."
"66848564-0-4676";"I just want to die. Please let it be over."
"66848564-0-4677";"Thanks for your help."
"66848564-0-4678";"Where are they?"
"66848564-0-4681";"The dark vines of the Reach dig deep."
"66848564-0-4693";"Please, I need to speak to you immediately!"
"66848564-0-4694";"Hello, friend!"
"66848564-0-4695";"Message for you, comrade!"
"66848564-0-4696";"The spirits of the dead do not rest quietly."
"66848564-0-4697";"The Worms still coil, my lord."
"66848564-0-4700";"The true test comes. Prepare yourselves!"
"66848564-0-4713";"Watch your step around here, stranger!"
"66848564-0-4715";"Who protects us from our own protectors?"
"66848564-0-4716";"We need to make a stand here!"
"66848564-0-4717";"Battles make one thirsty."
"66848564-0-4718";"They'll pay for this. Oh, yes. They'll pay."
"66848564-0-4720";"I can't believe this. If anyone finds out …."
"66848564-0-4723";"There must be something we can do for the King."
"66848564-0-4724";"Hail, traveler! Join us!"
"66848564-0-4725";"Time grows short. What to do? What to do?"
"66848564-0-4726";"Where did you come from?"
"66848564-0-4728";"Ho there, adept!"
"66848564-0-4729";"Adept, good to see you."
"66848564-0-4730";"Father, we have to get you to safety."
"66848564-0-4732";"No harm shall befall you in this place."
"66848564-0-4734";"Damn her to the depths of Oblivion!"
"66848564-0-4738";"Oh, it's you! How droll to see you again all the way out here."
"66848564-0-4740";"Please … I need help …."
"66848564-0-4741";"When you're done sorting the relics, you can begin on the translations."
"66848564-0-4742";"The magicka-lattice can be disrupted. But the underlying problem remains."
"66848564-0-4753";"Xarxes guide me, I must find a way to save them."
"66848564-0-4754";"The crew's in danger!"
"66848564-0-4756";"Please, help! The research must be saved!"
"66848564-0-4757";"Where could she be?"
"66848564-0-4759";"Are those Worm Cultists still chasing me?"
"66848564-0-4762";"Stop, traveler."
"66848564-0-4763";"Halt. Go no further."
"66848564-0-4764";"Hold! I was sent for you!"
"66848564-0-4767";"Oh, this isn't good."
"66848564-0-4775";"Thank the Divines! Someone new!"
"66848564-0-4783";"So … cold."
"66848564-0-4790";"Not one of these idiots is Guardian material."
"66848564-0-4791";"Geirmund was a man misunderstood in his own day. Fascinating, fascinating."
"66848564-0-4792";"Kyne, bless these drunkards. Don't let them crack their skulls."
"66848564-0-4795";"They're all gone. Help!"
"66848564-0-4796";"So many visitors, so little time."
"66848564-0-4798";"Tower, Steed, and Thief! Where are they?"
"66848564-0-4799";"The Captain will want to hear about this."
"66848564-0-4800";"Stars guide your steps."
"66848564-0-4801";"You smell different, mortal. I could use you."
"66848564-0-4802";"We need to hold this line. Let nothing through!"
"66848564-0-4804";"We've got to close these portals."
"66848564-0-4805";"We must hold the line!"
"66848564-0-4816";"What will I do? What will I do?"
"66848564-0-4817";"Only the brave travel these roads now."
"66848564-0-4818";"Here you are. Hail, Arrow of the King."
"66848564-0-4819";"There's one thing worse than being lost, and that's being bored."
"66848564-0-4820";"Just cause I can't get up doesn't mean I couldn't wrestle you to the ground for staring at me like that, fella."
"66848564-0-4821";"Hold, soldier!"
"66848564-0-4823";"If the Reach are pushing here, then … hmm. Perhaps one of the Argonian trackers."
"66848564-0-4828";"Traveler! You there! A word with you, please."
"66848564-0-4829";"No! How could they? Such evil."
"66848564-0-4834";"We should've been more prepared."
"66848564-0-4835";"Who is this? Who let them in here?"
"66848564-0-4842";"Leave me be, you cowardly bastards! You can't have me or my buried treasure!"
"66848564-0-4844";"What a horror show. Poor Raerana."
"66848564-0-4847";"Guard the fields, she says. Who's going to hurt the crops?"
"66848564-0-4848";"Stars keep us all safe from disease."
"66848564-0-4851";"Be careful! It's dangerous here!"
"66848564-0-4853";"Harnald is going to be so mad!"
"66848564-0-4855";"Such a lovely day for a stroll past Mathiisen."
"66848564-0-4857";"Please. Stars above, help me!"
"66848564-0-4858";"Hold up there."
"66848564-0-4859";"Halt, traveler."
"66848564-0-4860";"Stop a moment, please."
"66848564-0-4861";"Stop, citizen."
"66848564-0-4866";"The Heart of Mara beats within my breast. Keep and sustain me. Keep and sustain me."
"66848564-0-4867";"Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me."
"66848564-0-4868";"Will no one help us?"
"66848564-0-4869";"Quickly, come here!"
"66848564-0-4870";"Going to gut him when I find him."
"66848564-0-4872";"Hello! Can you help me?"
"66848564-0-4875";"Stars above, get over here."
"66848564-0-4877";"Those damned cultists!"
"66848564-0-4885";"If I survive this, I swear I'll never drink again!"
"66848564-0-4886";"Where'd the party go?"
"66848564-0-4887";"You don't look like a draugr."
"66848564-0-4889";"I am sorry. There is no more I can do for him with the supplies I have."
"66848564-0-4891";"I'm so helpless! Won't someone help me?"
"66848564-0-4893";"These old bones aren't what they used to be."
"66848564-0-4894";"Who's this now?"
"66848564-0-4899";"The Captain will want to hear about this."
"66848564-0-4900";"Damn it, what was Harnald thinking?"
"66848564-0-4909";"You look capable."
"66848564-0-4911";"Oh Palith. My daughter. Where are you?"
"66848564-0-4914";"Someone picked a bad time to visit Narsis."
"66848564-0-4915";"Over here!"
"66848564-0-4916";"You there! Over here"
"66848564-0-4917";"It's about time you got here!"
"66848564-0-4919";"The people of Crosswych have had enough!"
"66848564-0-4920";"I'm going to flay that fool Orc alive!"
"66848564-0-4921";"Hey! You there! Be a friend and get me out of here."
"66848564-0-4924";"How'd he even get into the ruin?"
"66848564-0-4925";"Yes, yes, in a moment. No, put that back!"
"66848564-0-4926";"Over here! Soldier, we're here!"
"66848564-0-4927";"You can't just let my village burn!"
"66848564-0-4928";"We have to stop the Bloodthorn!"
"66848564-0-4930";"Keep your head down!"
"66848564-0-4933";"You're not supposed to be here, are you?"
"66848564-0-4936";"I need help. Help!"
"66848564-0-4939";"Finish your preparations. We head out momentarily."
"66848564-0-4944";"You're alive! That's wonderful! Can we talk?"
"66848564-0-4949";"Ah, another mortal happens by."

"66848564-0-5209";"Hold, friend. I would warn you."
"66848564-0-5210";"It's so good to see someone who's, well, alive!"
"66848564-0-5218";"Something doesn't add up here."
"66848564-0-5220";"Keep your weapons sheathed, newcomer!"
"66848564-0-5221";"Be at peace, ancestors. What curse disturbs your rest?"
"66848564-0-5223";"I can't believe I lost everything!"
"66848564-0-5225";"That Goblin. Wait 'til I find it!"
"66848564-0-5231";"Be at peace, ancestors. What curse disturbs your rest?"
"66848564-0-5234";"Come to help the great Lord Diel, have you?"
"66848564-0-5235";"… heh, and they buy them! A true walker, that one."
"66848564-0-5242";"Stranger, I need your help!"
"66848564-0-5243";"You! You are not dead!"
"66848564-0-5244";"Quickly … before it's too late."
"66848564-0-5246";"These seems no end to these damnable Colovians."
"66848564-0-5247";"You there! <<1>> will need your help."
"66848564-0-5248";"Help shore up these walls or we're all dead."
"66848564-0-5249";"Blast it, Sgrugha, stop fussing over me."
"66848564-0-5251";"You there! Want to make a bit of gold?"
"66848564-0-5252";"Hey you! Want to make a bit of gold?"
"66848564-0-5253";"I don't know how we're going to get out of this one."
"66848564-0-5254";"We just need to hold the line until the Moon Hallowed arrives."
"66848564-0-5257";"You there!"
"66848564-0-5258";"How will I ever get it back? I cannot perform without my lute!"
"66848564-0-5259";"Oh, what have I done?"
"66848564-0-5266";"That fool girl. She doesn't know what she's doing."
"66848564-0-5267";"… not there. Like it was scraped out with some kind of tool. Magic of some kind, it must be!"
"66848564-0-5274";"I ask the honor of another favor."
"66848564-0-5285";"By the Light of Aetherius! There you are!"
"66848564-0-5287";"I call upon the powers …."
"66848564-0-5290";"The king must be told the news. He won't like it."
"66848564-0-5291";"I've … got to get out of here …."
"66848564-0-5294";"Moons-be-damned this is aggravating."
"66848564-0-5301";"I'm doomed!"
"66848564-0-5304";"Pardon me! Over here!"
"66848564-0-5305";"I'm ruined!"
"66848564-0-5307";"You there! I have a lucrative proposition for you."
"66848564-0-5308";"The dreugh won't remain calm at this rate."
"66848564-0-5309";"Make it quick, we have a province to run."
"66848564-0-5310";"Zombies! Hordes of the damn things!"
"66848564-0-5322";"It works! It really works!"
"66848564-0-5323";"Curse you, Rilis."
"66848564-0-5326";"Please help me, I don't know what to do."
"66848564-0-5331";"There's trouble. We need you."
"66848564-0-5332";"Now where did he run off to now?"
"66848564-0-5333";"Bring the Light. Hurry!"
"66848564-0-5336";"Welcome, friend, to the Hollow City."
"66848564-0-5337";"What do they want from us? We merely tend eggs."
"66848564-0-5339";"Sometimes the right thing and the wrong thing are the same thing."
"66848564-0-5341";"Little time remains. The hatching ritual must be completed, regardless of the Dominion's presence."
"66848564-0-5342";"Be careful! The Bosmer here will attack!"
"66848564-0-5350";"One foot after the other and eyes forward, Heluin. Best not look at what you've left behind."
"66848564-0-5354";"She is lost to me. What do I do now?"
"66848564-0-5357";"What am I missing here?"
"66848564-0-5358";"The vicecanon knows what she's doing. She'll be all right."
"66848564-0-5359";"The vicecanon knows what she's doing."
"66848564-0-5364";"That's all we can do for now."
"66848564-0-5369";"Can any of you hear me? Where are you?"
"66848564-0-5370";"You're here. Good, good."
"66848564-0-5372";"Please, a moment!"
"66848564-0-5374";"I can't go on like this. Fine. We. We can't go on like this."
"66848564-0-5375";"Nothing but trouble here. I never hear the end of it."
"66848564-0-5376";"I can't believe I finally found it."
"66848564-0-5380";"Why does this always happen to me?"
"66848564-0-5385";"Damn. Everything tastes like blood. That can't be good."
"66848564-0-5386";"Hey. Yeah, you. Come here!"
"66848564-0-5389";"Wayfarer, come speak with me, please."
"66848564-0-5390";"You there! Are you a miner?"
"66848564-0-5391";"They've been captured!"
"66848564-0-5402";"Welcome to Arenthia."
"66848564-0-5415";"Well, maybe this day hasn't been a waste after all."
"66848564-0-5418";"Where can he be?"
"66848564-0-5419";"I just pray to the Eight they're still alive."
"66848564-0-5422";"I was beginning to doubt you would come."
"66848564-0-5423";"And you actually appear to still have your wits about you!"
"66848564-0-5424";"Stop! Stay back!"
"66848564-0-5428";"I really hate hay. I could live forever and never smell hay again."
"66848564-0-5429";"I hear your pain, old one. I'm doing what I can."
"66848564-0-5430";"My father told me someone would come."
"66848564-0-5432";"My father told me someone would come."
"66848564-0-5436";"The fish are no match for this one today."
"66848564-0-5439";"Baan Dar's fingers! I've never read anything more confusing in my life!"
"66848564-0-5441";"I don't know how much more of this I can take."
"66848564-0-5442";"I can't believe this is happening!"
"66848564-0-5443";"Oh, I never should have left him!"
"66848564-0-5444";"Did you really just jump down here? Really?"
"66848564-0-5446";"Keep your voice down. Don't want anyone on the road to hear us."
"66848564-0-5450";"Naemon must be stopped."
"66848564-0-5452";"All this wasted effort. Blasted creatures get into everything!"
"66848564-0-5453";"The unthinkable has happened. Please. I need your help."
"66848564-0-5455";"Hush, father. I won't leave your side."
"66848564-0-5456";"Where is she?"
"66848564-0-5457";"How am I going to get in there?"
"66848564-0-5463";"Am I hallucinating?"
"66848564-0-5466";"Ah, it's about bloody time you showed up!"
"66848564-0-5473";"All my effort, for nothing."
"66848564-0-5474";"The tale spins on and on, but the threads can be broken."
"66848564-0-5484";"May the light of the Moons show us the path."
"66848564-0-5487";"Vampires! Why did it have to be vampires?"
"66848564-0-5489";"He's in for a beating, if he ever shows up!"
"66848564-0-5502";"Do the gods truly have no mercy?"
"66848564-0-5511";"A beating! That's a fine welcome for a prospective soldier."
"66848564-0-5512";"Moons above, how will we get the relics now?"
"66848564-0-5513";"Come and speak with me my friend."
"66848564-0-5515";"Come no closer!"
"66848564-0-5516";"Do you see how the fire spread, soldier? Does that look natural to you?"
"66848564-0-5522";"I feel strong, friends, very strong."
"66848564-0-5523";"<<1>>, <<2>>, <<3>>! Where are you?"
"66848564-0-5524";"Welcome to Willowgrove, traveler."
"66848564-0-5525";"May the Green keep you, traveler!"
"66848564-0-5529";"This couldn't have come at a worse time."
"66848564-0-5531";"That thing ate my soul!"
"66848564-0-5533";"Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me."
"66848564-0-5534";"Hey! Fleshy! Over here!"
"66848564-0-5536";"Please, just go away. Just go away."
"66848564-0-5537";"This one doesn't want to die …"
"66848564-0-5538";"Irresponsible. Completely Irresponsible."
"66848564-0-5541";"Each blade stands alone, even in the midst of a field."
"66848564-0-5542";"New students arrive each day, it seems."
"66848564-0-5548";"I can't let this happen again. Not again!"
"66848564-0-5549";"Please, you must help me save Stibbons!"
"66848564-0-5550";"I just hope our friend was able to recover the key to the Labyrinth, or all our efforts will have been for naught."
"66848564-0-5555";"We'll take out the sentry on western parapet first, then we'll charge the main gate."
"66848564-0-5556";"At last, someone to help."
"66848564-0-5557";"There you are! I have been looking for you!"
"66848564-0-5562";"This bird'll do nicely."
"66848564-0-5566";"Over here!"
"66848564-0-5570";"Pst! You! Help me. Please!"
"66848564-0-5572";"Over here! You aren't with the Wormies, are you?"
"66848564-0-5574";"Ah, here comes the champion. Just in time, as always."
"66848564-0-5575";"What do they put in that White-Eye brandy? Ohh …."
"66848564-0-5576";"The great and wondrous Vanus Galerion has a message for you."
"66848564-0-5582";"Those frozen faces. I can't go down there. I don't want to end up like them!"
"66848564-0-5583";"Ah, there you are."
"66848564-0-5586";"Please, the alliance leaders are waiting."
"66848564-0-5587";"I've lost a fortune in this mine!"
"66848564-0-5588";"Stay vigilant. Pact soldiers were seen on this road only recently. Wherever they are, Aldolin can't be far."
"66848564-0-5589";"Can't hide. Can't hide. They see everything, don't they?"
"66848564-0-5590";"How many must die before this hunt ends?"
"66848564-0-5592";"I have to get her back. She's all I have left!"
"66848564-0-5594";"What does it take to get a rescue around here?"
"66848564-0-5600";"My friend! How good it is to see you!"
"66848564-0-5601";"Foolish Manthir. What exactly do you think is going to happen to you, hm?"
"66848564-0-5602";"We should've expected as much from him. Thinks he's above all the rest of us."
"66848564-0-5603";"You there! Please, help me!"
"66848564-0-5607";"Thieving a thief. How exquisite."
"66848564-0-5608";"Help, help! There's something wrong!"
"66848564-0-5609";"Hmm. Yes, that's just in line with the third law of arcanodynamics. Excellent."
"66848564-0-5610";"Hmm. Yes, that's just in line with the third law of arcanodynamics. Excellent."
"66848564-0-5611";"Over here, initiate!"
"66848564-0-5623";"Prince Azah was looking for you."
"66848564-0-5630";"This one wonders what it tastes like. Does anyone know?"
"66848564-0-5631";"Well, I think my problems may be over…."
"66848564-0-5632";"Ah, a hero! My troubles are over."
"66848564-0-5634";"Hey, slowpaws!"
"66848564-0-5637";"I will not leave you, beloved. The demons will not claim your body for their army."
"66848564-0-5640";"Hey, over here!"
"66848564-0-5641";"I will not leave you, beloved. The demons will not claim your body for their army."
"66848564-0-5642";"Withered Hand, Imperials, … what's next?"
"66848564-0-5646";"The Queen must be told of our victory here today."
"66848564-0-5651";"We've got almost everything!"
"66848564-0-5653";"Mead, mead, mead. I like it morning, noon and eve! How does the rest of that song go?"
"66848564-0-5654";"Stupid cart. I really need to get a new one—oh! Hello!"
"66848564-0-5658";"Curse that mammoth! How is something that big so elusive?"
"66848564-0-5659";"That troll can't have gotten far."
"66848564-0-5660";"There's never a wasp nest around when you need it."
"66848564-0-5679";"This is truly a sign from Ruptga."
"66848564-0-5680";"I leave things to my brother, and this is what happens."
"66848564-0-5684";"Keep calm, just have to keep calm."
"66848564-0-5687";"I've got to get back in there."
"66848564-0-5688";"Oh, tell me, please. Is someone there?"
"66848564-0-5689";"They must be out there. How could this have happened?"
"66848564-0-5692";"Tall Papa, please keep the ghosts at bay."
"66848564-0-5697";"There must be some way to get in. There must be."
"66848564-0-5698";"You there, please. You must help me."
"66848564-0-5702";"Come forward."
"66848564-0-5703";"Come, speak with your Skald-King!"
"66848564-0-5705";"We cured the blight, but Naemon is still out there."
"66848564-0-5706";"Naemon and his undead army must be stopped."
"66848564-0-5713";"Be not afraid."
"66848564-0-5716";"He's too sick to travel again if this fails!"
"66848564-0-5717";"You stomp around like a wounded guar! Do you want the enemy to eat us?"
"66848564-0-5718";"Hold! I have an urgent message for you from the queen."
"66848564-0-5724";"Let me out of here! I taste horrible—I promise! Eat somebody else!"
"66848564-0-5726";"Know that this is <<1>>'s forest and we are his Briars. If you want to join us, you'll need to pay your respects."
"66848564-0-5729";"We must find a way to stop the Colovians."
"66848564-0-5730";"What will it take to remove these Colovians from our land?"
"66848564-0-5747";"The woods are no place for a princess."
"66848564-0-5750";"Ah, what a beautiful day!"
"66848564-0-5756";"Help! Oh, help me! Get me out of here!"
"66848564-0-5757";"How could I be such a fool?"
"66848564-0-5760";"I feel it too, sister. The Hagraven's influence grows stronger."
"66848564-0-5762";"I know the answer lies in the stones … I know it!"
"66848564-0-5763";"Now where have they disappeared to? Good help is so hard to find these days."
"66848564-0-5765";"You're just the type Sergeant Antieve is looking for."
"66848564-0-5766";"Aren't you going to say goodbye?"
"66848564-0-5770";"Search my packs, you will find nothing! This one is innocent! Tell her <<1>>!"
"66848564-0-5771";"I can't believe this. Injured on my first real mission!"
"66848564-0-5775";"Watch out for the Imperial archers!"
"66848564-0-5776";"Where are those scouts?"
"66848564-0-5777";"What do Jone and Jode send us now?"
"66848564-0-5778";"So close to home. So far from help."
"66848564-0-5779";"There were too many of them. Too many!"
"66848564-0-5783";"Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of women and war!"
"66848564-0-5792";"Um … I can't do my job. Not with all this going on!"
"66848564-0-5796";"Hopeless, it's all hopeless. I'll never finish my research now."
"66848564-0-5798";"All right everyone. It's time to start making preparations!"
"66848564-0-5800";"So you have come. Her vision holds true."
"66848564-0-5803";"You there! Untie me!"
"66848564-0-5805";"Where has that confounded guar gotten to now?"
"66848564-0-5807";"Our moment is at hand!"
"66848564-0-5813";"May my brothers and sisters bring the dead to rest."
"66848564-0-5815";"She needs some hope, some reason to live."
"66848564-0-5818";"Over here, friend, when you get a chance."
"66848564-0-5824";"Too old, my tusk! I'll show him too old!"
"66848564-0-5827";"Where are they? Damn the undead."
"66848564-0-5829";"What's happened here? My home!"
"66848564-0-5830";"Please. Have mercy. Let me explain."
"66848564-0-5831";"Reachmen in Northglen. This is terrible."
"66848564-0-5833";"Look at this mess! Damn bloodfiends!"
"66848564-0-5834";"We have to find a way inside."
"66848564-0-5839";"He's still not back!"
"66848564-0-5840";"The line never ends."
"66848564-0-5841";"Shameful. This is not the Dominion we were promised."
"66848564-0-5842";"All this way, and for nothing!"
"66848564-0-5845";"Smell that air. Smells like victory."
"66848564-0-5846";"Oh, a Dominion soldier! Can you help me?"
"66848564-0-5848";"Might I have a word with my husband's new best friend?"
"66848564-0-5849";"Orcs are all about honor and all that, yeah? I wonder if he really tricked me."
"66848564-0-5853";"We have need of you in <<1>>!"
"66848564-0-5854";"Uela the Hagraven is the true evil here."
"66848564-0-5855";"Well met, traveler. Archimbert is the name, though most just call me Bert. You're welcome to warm yourself by my fire."
"66848564-0-5860";"Ha! Now I almost feel sorry for the Imperials! Almost."
"66848564-0-5862";"Hey. Over here."
"66848564-0-5864";"Trust me, Thaendil. Magical transport is the only way this many Redguard could have appeared here so suddenly. We need to cut them off before an entire army is on our doorstep."
"66848564-0-5865";"Speak to me, child."
"66848564-0-5866";"Is that you, <<1>>? I'm over here!"
"66848564-0-5869";"I still can't believe it's all gone. What are we going to do?"
"66848564-0-5870";"I have to … have to get back to the camp!"
"66848564-0-5871";"My wife! What have I done?"
"66848564-0-5872";"Curse this place. I've got to get inside."
"66848564-0-5877";"Those Tamriths! So high and mighty!"
"66848564-0-5881";"The forest sings to me, but it is a song of sorrow. Something must be done."
"66848564-0-5884";"You look like someone who seeks to travel while earning honest coin! \n\nWould you like to hear about a great opportunity for both of these ambitions?"
"66848564-0-5885";"This could be the key to filing in the gaps of the Valenwood variant of the Ayleidoon tongue. If only we had the missing pieces . . ."
"66848564-0-5887";"She'll come back. She has to."
"66848564-0-5890";"<<1>>, I hope you know how much of a bind your little disappearance has put me in!"
"66848564-0-5892";"If he was the thief, then that means … hm. No. But if her name was …. Bah! This is impossible!"
"66848564-0-5894";"Hey! Smart-looking person! Over here!"
"66848564-0-5895";"You, there. This one needs assistance."
"66848564-0-5896";"Not good. This is not good at all."
"66848564-0-5900";"Gods damn these spiders!"
"66848564-0-5901";"You, there, do you serve the Seventh Legion?"
"66848564-0-5905";"Come on, come on. We haven't got all day!"
"66848564-0-5906";"What are you doing here, city dweller?"
"66848564-0-5908";"I'm just sitting here! Did <<1>> send you? Go away!"
"66848564-0-5910";"Greetings, citizen. Do you have a moment?"
"66848564-0-5911";"Over here! Come quickly!"
"66848564-0-5914";"'lo."
"66848564-0-5919";"It's you! Over here! Quickly, I've got something exciting!"
"66848564-0-5926";"Hey! Before you go, come here a moment."
"66848564-0-5941";"We must keep moving forward."
"66848564-0-5944";"To come so far and be obstructed by this vileness … my beloved, I miss you so."
"66848564-0-5946";"<<1>> could be in luck."
"66848564-0-5948";"Where are those bumbling fools?"
"66848564-0-5950";"My poor, poor Crestshade."
"66848564-0-5952";"I am so not going in there."
"66848564-0-5955";"Is there trouble brewing? Or just wasting time again?"
"66848564-0-5956";"Can't … so cold …."
"66848564-0-5957";"Everything … is spinning. So dark …."
"66848564-0-5958";"It cannot be true. Can it?"
"66848564-0-5959";"I'll send that bastard back to the dirt if it's the last thing I do."
"66848564-0-5963";"If I can get just one more recruit, maybe the general will stop hounding me."
"66848564-0-5964";"Arkay protect me. Atkay give me strength."
"66848564-0-5968";"Finally, my friend! I was beginning to worry about you."
"66848564-0-5970";"The Apex Stone could be the key. If only I could get my hands on the tools those ancient priests possessed."
"66848564-0-5972";"You there! Please, you must help!"
"66848564-0-5974";"Hey, over here. I have a message for you."
"66848564-0-5976";"Though many attempt the race, not all shall beat the wind's pace to finish."
"66848564-0-5983";"The bear's jaw … the fox's leg … and the boar's tusk. Hm …."
"66848564-0-5985";"Please, listen to me for just a moment. It's very important."
"66848564-0-5987";"I should have heard news by now."
"66848564-0-5988";"I should have heard something by now …."
"66848564-0-5989";"You've arrived at an auspicious time."
"66848564-0-5990";"Can't quit now. Stay awake, Dathy."
"66848564-0-5991";"Spiders! Damn the gods, why is it always spiders?"
"66848564-0-5992";"Hello there! Please, can you help?"
"66848564-0-5993";"Fascinating. The ebb and flow of magicka … so deft."
"66848564-0-5994";"Skeletons or Daggers. Dry scales, I'm not sure what's worse."
"66848564-0-5995";"Ysgramor watch over us."
"66848564-0-5998";"Where is that blasted lizard?"
"66848564-0-5999";"No screeching, bitter-old Hagraven and her bandit cronies will get the best of Parquier Gimbert!  Ooooh … my head."
"66848564-0-6003";"How long is this going to take …?"
"66848564-0-6009";"Count Verandis! We know you're in there! Open the door, please!"
"66848564-0-6012";"Thrice-damned vampires. You try to wage a proper war and what happens? They attack when you've got them on the run! It isn't right!"
"66848564-0-6013";"Backs straight! Heads back! No sway-backed lollygagging while I'm on watch!"
"66848564-0-6014";"Traveler! A moment, please?"
"66848564-0-6019";"Hmm hmm hmm …."
"66848564-0-6020";"Ah, this is the one! Hail, comrade!"
"66848564-0-6021";"These Wood Elves and their forest spirits. Dull claws are they strange."
"66848564-0-6030";"You have to open those gates eventually, you s'wits!"
"66848564-0-6031";"Auri-El keep and sustain me. Give me strength in this dark time."
"66848564-0-6032";"Stendarr, hear me. Give me the courage to face this darkness. The strong arm to end this corruption."
"66848564-0-6033";"Dethisam, lie down! You need to rest."
"66848564-0-6034";"Uncle! Oh, what's going to become of you?"
"66848564-0-6035";"Then it's settled. No one goes in or out until the talks have concluded."
"66848564-0-6036";"Fools, the lot of you! It's the truth! Stendarr's mercy, when I get out of these binds …."
"66848564-0-6039";"Hmm. A fascinating application of the technique …."
"66848564-0-6040";"You should go no further."
"66848564-0-6041";"Next time I'm in the field … I think I'll bring a great warhammer. Or two … hmm."
"66848564-0-6042";"I never knew that about netches. Have to try that next time I'm in the field …."
"66848564-0-6046";"I'll need a new blade before I go into the field again. Hmm …."
"66848564-0-6049";"But if I form the lattice clockwise … no, no. That would cause an enormous explosion."
"66848564-0-6051";"It's been so long since I was in the field. The sounds of battle …."
"66848564-0-6055";"When did these accursed soldiers appear? Have I been gone so long?"
"66848564-0-6056";"This isn't good. And we don't have the men …."
"66848564-0-6057";"Stop pawing at me and listen! You have to send someone before it's too late!"
"66848564-0-6059";"Rest now, my love. It's all right. At least we're here."
"66848564-0-6060";"This place makes me nervous. The sooner we can get out of here, the better."
"66848564-0-6064";"Finally, a sane person! Hey you!"
"66848564-0-6065";"Please. Stars above, help me!"
"66848564-0-6067";"I wish I had time to help Erold, but my hands are full right now."
"66848564-0-6069";"Oh Divines, grant rest to these fallen ones."
"66848564-0-6077";"There's something else you can help me with."
"66848564-0-6103";"Hark wayfarer! A moment of your time, please."
"66848564-0-6106";"Impeccable timing. Razum-dar's luck strikes again."
"66848564-0-6108";"You there! Are you the courier from Artisans Craftworks in Mournhold?"
"66848564-0-6109";"Where in Oblivion is Hughes?"
"66848564-0-6111";"You there! You don't look like one of these bandits."
"66848564-0-6112";"Can I beg a moment of your time?"
"66848564-0-6114";"Please don't hurt me!"
"66848564-0-6116";"Faolchu is dead … but these spirits linger still."
"66848564-0-6117";"I can't believe it. The whole city … everything … gone."
"66848564-0-6119";"This won't do. This just won't do at all."
"66848564-0-6127";"You've done so much for us in such a short time, Hara. I hope you're not overdoing it."
"66848564-0-6130";"Shada's Tear is eternally cursed, and I am most cursed of all."
"66848564-0-6132";"Shoo! Go play with a Khajiit or something!"
"66848564-0-6145";"I would have words with you, mortal!"
"66848564-0-6157";"The Celestial Mage? In pieces? That's crazy talk."
"66848564-0-6161";"Nerien'eth, don't do this!"
"66848564-0-6162";"Hey, you're alive!"
"66848564-0-6163";"You there, serpent hunter! May we speak?"
"66848564-0-6165";"You're awake!"
"66848564-0-6166";"You there, wet one. This one needs to speak to you."
"66848564-0-6169";"We've got plenty of trouble of our own …."
"66848564-0-6190";"Careful! I erect the spine of warning. Stay back! It's dangerous out here."
"66848564-0-6192";"First they beat me bloody, then the little goats come to play …."
"66848564-0-6198";"Nerien'eth, don't do this!"
"66848564-0-6207";"Curse these Scaled Court vermin! A wellspring of research beneath our feet, and they're tearing it apart. I wish there was someone around who could stop them."
"66848564-0-6219";"Don't attack me. I'm not your enemy."
"66848564-0-6229";"How am I going to do this on my own?"
"66848564-0-6264";"Akatosh be my resolve, Stendarr be my shield, and Arkay light my way. I must try to set things right in this foul place."
"66848564-0-6267";"Well met, friend! It seems we have a new problem."
"66848564-0-6268";"You there! You are known to us. May we speak?"
"66848564-0-6273";"Would you do one more task for me?"
"66848564-0-6289";"Did you come here for crafting certification?"
"66848564-0-6290";"If you came for crafting certification, I can assist you."
"66848564-0-6291";"To me, champion! We are connected through my Apex Stone, so only you can see me. I must ask you to set something right before it is too late."
"66848564-0-6292";"Pause a moment, champion. I bring word from the great warrior."
"66848564-0-6309";"Shoo! Go play with a Khajiit or something!"
"66848564-0-6369";"Kireth! Are you all right? Don't expect me to come down there. You know I can't stand small spaces!"
"66848564-0-6373";"Why do all the best opportunities always involve caves …?"
"66848564-0-6374";"Dead. They're all dead."
"66848564-0-6377";"This is an amazing example of Dwarven crafting. Raynor really needs to come down and see this."
"66848564-0-6379";"I need to find out what happened in the quarry. Where's that Elf we hired?"
"66848564-0-6382";"This skull seems abnormal for an Orc. If only I had my calipers …."
"66848564-0-6384";"Who goes there?"
"66848564-0-6394";"The Silver Dawn is lost, but I swear to make the pack pay."
"66848564-0-6402";"Malacath … I pray your words … aren't lost …."
"66848564-0-6419";"Azurah help me …."
"66848564-0-6474";"Now can we get off this damn beach?"
"66848564-0-6498";"Time for Heem-Jas to save the day."
"66848564-0-6545";"I told Gloorot that setting up house near a Nord barrow would be trouble."
"66848564-0-6547";"Rigurt would like to speak words with you, my friend!"
"66848564-0-6548";"Fool girl. She'll get herself killed!"
"66848564-0-6550";"No amount of gold is worth your life! Now sit down and rest, you idiot!"
"66848564-0-6552";"This wretched mountain will be the death of me. I'm freezing out here!"
"66848564-0-6555";"Over here! Come have a drink with Wrothgar's king!"
"66848564-0-6556";"I was wondering when you'd show up."
"66848564-0-6557";"Reikrs aren't usually that much trouble, but these were organized."
"66848564-0-6560";"Sorry, grandfather. This has to do."
"66848564-0-6562";"You there, outsider. I would speak with you."
"66848564-0-6563";"I don't understand. Why won't it open?"
"66848564-0-6566";"Where is he? There's late, and then there's this."
"66848564-0-6568";"Ah, my friend and ally has returned! Come, let's talk!"
"66848564-0-6570";"This is a great discovery. Why can't she see that?"
"66848564-0-6572";"Oh, Shalda, where are you?"
"66848564-0-6576";"My head! Did anyone see where that rolling bucket of rust happened to go?"
"66848564-0-6578";"Hold, outsider. I bring a message from the king."
"66848564-0-6579";"This is not justice."
"66848564-0-6580";"The drink is ready. Now for the appetizer."
"66848564-0-6581";"The main course? No, no … not yet."
"66848564-0-6582";"All right. I'm finally ready."
"66848564-0-6583";"What a mess."
"66848564-0-6584";"This one committed no crime! Please, help <<1>>!"
"66848564-0-6587";"Come in, come in! Feel free to look around!"
"66848564-0-6588";"Damn soldiers and their damn rules and regulations!"
"66848564-0-6592";"Where could she be? Where could she be?"
"66848564-0-6593";"One more piece. It's almost complete!"
"66848564-0-6594";"All right, Egnatius, where have they taken you?"
"66848564-0-6595";"Time isn't on our side, my friend."
"66848564-0-6596";"It's time to make our move. You're prepared, yes?"
"66848564-0-6597";"Blast, there must be something edible in here."
"66848564-0-6598";"If I were a stronger man, I'd go out and look for it myself."
"66848564-0-6599";"Psst! Over here."
"66848564-0-6602";"Hold a moment, soldier! The Pact needs you!"
"66848564-0-6603";"Malacath's faithful could use your aid."
"66848564-0-6604";"Hold a moment, soldier! The Pact needs you!"
"66848564-0-6605";"Come on, Regilus. You're being stupid."
"66848564-0-6606";"Why do people read this nonsense …?"
"66848564-0-6607";"It will work, I know it."
"66848564-0-6608";"Gods, what a mess …."
"66848564-0-6609";"Gods, what a mess …."
"66848564-0-6610";"Hold a moment, soldier! The Covenant needs you!"
"66848564-0-6611";"I have one last favor to ask of you."
"66848564-0-6612";"Walker, please. Do you have a moment?"
"66848564-0-6613";"Hold a moment, soldier! The Covenant needs you!"
"66848564-0-6614";"Sorry, grandfather. This has to do."
"66848564-0-6615";"Hold a moment, soldier! The Dominion needs you!"
"66848564-0-6616";"Hold a moment, walker! The Dominion needs you!"
"66848564-0-6617";"Does nobody understand true art?"
"66848564-0-6618";"Gods, what a mess. What a frightful mess."
"66848564-0-6619";"Why does the land spin so fast?"
"66848564-0-6620";"Hey! You here to cause trouble too?"
"66848564-0-6621";"That's right, you Daedric pig. Come to Brihana."
"66848564-0-6622";"Gods, what a mess. What a frightful mess."
"66848564-0-6623";"Ready to cause some more trouble?"
"66848564-0-6624";"Good to see you. Do you have time to speak?"
"66848564-0-6625";"That's right, you Daedric pig. Come to Brihana."
"66848564-0-6626";"You've returned! Thank the Eight."
"66848564-0-6627";"Ha! Now that's a sight!"
"66848564-0-6629";"There's nothing out here but snow and more snow. I should have remained at the campfire."
"66848564-0-6630";"I need to remember never to volunteer for anything ever again."
"66848564-0-6637";"I sure wish Master Dren was here."
"66848564-0-6643";"I think I made it. Got away clean. I don't think they followed me."
"66848564-0-6645";"So many … so many dead …."
"66848564-0-6659";"Rotten luck, chief. Rotten luck."
"66848564-0-6662";"Malacath, we have failed you!"
"66848564-0-6676";"Where's your sense of urgency, outsider?"
"66848564-0-6694";"Don't let this opportunity pass you by."
"66848564-0-6695";"There must be some way to convince her. Stubborn girl."
"66848564-0-6698";"Hey! Nobody boards the Prowler without my permission! Get over here!"
"66848564-0-6699";"We'll find gainful employment, Kireth. We just need to keep looking."
"66848564-0-6700";"This forsaken place draws the weak-willed like moths to a flame."
"66848564-0-6702";"See? Was that so hard? This one apologizes for causing you such discomfort, but Raz appreciates all that you have told him."
"66848564-0-6703";"Come here. The guild needs you."
"66848564-0-6705";"Mara's crotch, the next pirate I see gets my ax—right in the privates!"
"66848564-0-6707";"Walker! Walker, a moment!"
"66848564-0-6709";"Psst! Want to make some easy gold?"
"66848564-0-6712";"Over here."
"66848564-0-6713";"Psst. Over here."
"66848564-0-6726";"Oi! Over here!"
"66848564-0-6728";"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
"66848564-0-6730";"Assassin, when you have a moment."
"66848564-0-6732";"Well, this is awkward."
"66848564-0-6733";"What's a nice assassin like you doing in a place like this?"
"66848564-0-6735";"I can't do it … I just can't go back in there …."
"66848564-0-6748";"Come here. We have business."
"66848564-0-6752";"Your half-guildmaster-ness."
"66848564-0-6759";"Care to earn a little extra coin on the side? It's for a good cause."
"66848564-0-6761";"Hey, funny-looking!"
"66848564-0-6767";"How dare the Grand Sermonizer spread such lies!"
"66848564-0-6768";"We should talk. Guild business."
"66848564-0-6769";"This way."
"66848564-0-6771";"This client thinks her sweat doesn't stink!"
"66848564-0-6772";"I wonder, Assassin … do you have a moment to consider a request?"
"66848564-0-6773";"Assassin, the word has been given."
"66848564-0-6774";"Where has that girl gotten to this time?"
"66848564-0-6776";"Assassin, the time to strike is at hand."
"66848564-0-6778";"Psst. You. Over here."
"66848564-0-6794";"Uh … acting guildmaster? A word?"
"66848564-0-6797";"There you are! I've got news for you."
"66848564-0-6829";"The litany has begun."
"66848564-0-6832";"I was wondering when you'd show up."
"66848564-0-6859";"Hey, Initiate! Over here!"
"66848564-0-6860";"This isn't good. This isn't good at all."
"66848564-0-6861";"The family has need of you, Initiate."
"66848564-0-6862";"A moment of your time, Initiate."
"66848564-0-6877";"The Dark Brotherhood is more than a guild, Initiate. It's a family."
"66848564-0-6889";"It's a rare sight to see, so many of the family returning home at the same time."
"66848564-0-6892";"Astara needs you in the Sanctuary."
"66848564-0-6908";"Assassin, they need you at the Sanctuary."
"66848564-0-6924";"Clean cuts. Too clean. Hrm."
"66848564-0-6931";"Are you ready for your first contract?"
"66848564-0-6983";"The Apex Stone could be the key. If only I could get my hands on the tools those ancient priests possessed."
"66848564-0-6984";"Please, listen to me for just a moment. It's very important."
"66848564-0-6985";"Fools, the lot of you! It's the truth! Stendarr's mercy, when I get out of these binds …."
"66848564-0-6986";"When did these accursed soldiers appear? Have I been gone so long?"
"66848564-0-6987";"This place makes me nervous. The sooner we can get out of here, the better."
"66848564-0-6988";"I wish I had time to help Erold, but my hands are full right now."
"66848564-0-6989";"Oh Divines, grant rest to these fallen ones."
"66848564-0-6992";"Please don't hurt me!"
"66848564-0-6993";"I can't believe it. The whole city … everything … gone."
"66848564-0-6994";"This won't do. This just won't do at all."
"66848564-0-6998";"You've done so much for us in such a short time, Hara. I hope you're not overdoing it."
"66848564-0-7000";"Shada's Tear is eternally cursed, and I am most cursed of all."
"66848564-0-7001";"The Celestial Mage? In pieces? That's crazy talk."
"66848564-0-7002";"You there, serpent hunter! May we speak?"
"66848564-0-7003";"Careful! I erect the spine of warning. Stay back! It's dangerous out here."
"66848564-0-7004";"First they beat me bloody, then the little goats come to play …."
"66848564-0-7005";"Curse these Scaled Court vermin! A wellspring of research beneath our feet, and they're tearing it apart. I wish there was someone around who could stop them."
"66848564-0-7007";"Don't attack me. I'm not your enemy."
"66848564-0-7008";"How am I going to do this on my own?"
"66848564-0-7009";"Akatosh be my resolve, Stendarr be my shield, and Arkay light my way. I must try to set things right in this foul place."
"66848564-0-7010";"Well met, friend! It seems we have a new problem."
"66848564-0-7011";"You there! You are known to us. May we speak?"
"66848564-0-7014";"Would you do one more task for me?"
"66848564-0-7015";"To me, champion! We are connected through my Apex Stone, so only you can see me. I must ask you to set something right before it is too late."
"66848564-0-7016";"Pause a moment, champion. I bring word from the great warrior."
"66848564-0-7050";"Lord Vivec, we failed you."
"66848564-0-7064";"It is you. We must speak!"
"66848564-0-7081";"You there! Outlander! I have a proposition for you."
"66848564-0-7084";"Oh, look. Another caring citizen who's going to walk right on by and leave me like this. The gods have cursed me!"
"66848564-0-7085";"Oh, dear Tirwin, how I long to to see you smile."
"66848564-0-7088";"One more day, that is all I ask. Llayne and Menwendel must have a plan to save this place …."
"66848564-0-7089";"The Hero of Vos. I would have a word."
"66848564-0-7107";"You there! Keep your head down and come here!"
"66848564-0-7112";"You're safe now, citizen. Continue your journey in peace."
"66848564-0-7123";"He fell right out of the sky … like a bare-arsed comet!"
"66848564-0-7126";"Help! Someone, please help!"
"66848564-0-7127";"Help! Please, many lives are at stake!"
"66848564-0-7131";"Aren't you …. Yes, it is you. Come, we should speak."
"66848564-0-7132";"Sera! Please, a moment!"
"66848564-0-7133";"Another new face. Wonderful."
"66848564-0-7134";"Hold, citizen."
"66848564-0-7138";"All are welcome to celebrate the New Life!"
"66848564-0-7139";"I have another task for you, outlander."
"66848564-0-7140";"Bah! Dull-clawed, pieces of—. How could this happen, Falura? Argh!"
"66848564-0-7145";"Ah, a fellow outsider in this inhospitable sea of ash. I wonder if we might help each other?"
"66848564-0-7148";"You there! Adventurer!"
"66848564-0-7149";"I can't believe they want us to go outside the House to find Veya."
"66848564-0-7150";"Outlander, a moment, please."
"66848564-0-7152";"I can make it. Just a little farther—Ah! Wait, you're no Reachmen!"
"66848564-0-7154";"Stranger! Help me! We haven't got long!"
"66848564-0-7158";"Due to Lord Vivec's condition, it falls upon us to find a solution."
"66848564-0-7159";"Come to consult the great Divayth Fyr? Well, I'm rather preoccupied at the moment."
"66848564-0-7166";"Who's there? Show yourself."
"66848564-0-7167";"Lady of Mercy, forgive us. Forgive me. I should have said something. I should have warned them."
"66848564-0-7171";"What happened here? Where's the Archcanon?"
"66848564-0-7172";"Perhaps you can aid me. Are you looking for work?"
"66848564-0-7174";"Outlander … my time grows short …."
"66848564-0-7176";"Ah, another hunter seeks a worthy quarry."
"66848564-0-7177";"Will you hunt today, outlander?"
"66848564-0-7178";"Does the hunt call to you, outlander?"
"66848564-0-7179";"Outlander, how do you feel about mudcrabs of unusual size?"
"66848564-0-7180";"There's an ash beetle that should challenge your skills, outlander."
"66848564-0-7181";"The hunt beckons, outlander."
"66848564-0-7182";"Outlander, do you hunt?"
"66848564-0-7188";"I have another task for you, outsider."
"66848564-0-7189";"Outlander, a word."
"66848564-0-7192";"Well done, outlander, well done!"
"66848564-0-7193";"A newcomer, just as the Wise Woman foresaw …."
"66848564-0-7194";"The past and the future are simply two points on the same circle."
"66848564-0-7195";"Remember history or repeat the mistakes of the past."
"66848564-0-7196";"Our past is our strength, outlander."
"66848564-0-7197";"We see the future in the relics of the past."
"66848564-0-7198";"The more we learn about the past, the better prepared we are for the future."
"66848564-0-7199";"We preserve history so that nothing vital is lost."
"66848564-0-7202";"Outlander, over here!"
"66848564-0-7213";"Now there's a lively one! Come, your loving queen demands your attention."
"66848564-0-7214";"Ho! You there! Meaty King Jorunn demands a word!"
"66848564-0-7215";"So many new faces … oh, another one! You there! Speak with your king."
"66848564-0-7221";"I think we have an appointment with some Redoran soldiers."
"66848564-0-7223";"Enter the Library of Vivec and be welcome! If you seek knowledge, perhaps we can come to a suitable arrangement …."
"66848564-0-7244";"Just one frustration after another."
"66848564-0-7251";"How much longer must we wait?"
"66848564-0-7283";"Appointments. Bah! I would expect the name Divayth Fyr to carry more weight with these priests."
"66848564-0-7286";"One last task before your service ends, my friend."
"66848564-0-7289";"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
"66848564-0-7295";"Outlander, we have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-7297";"Greetings, wanderer. Come. Sit and eat and talk with me."
"66848564-0-7298";"You walk among the Urshilaku, outlander. If you come as a friend, speak with me."
"66848564-0-7299";"What business do you have with the Erabenimsun?"
"66848564-0-7307";"Are you aware of our patron, Saint Alessia? Her deeds? Her champion?"
"66848564-0-7320";"Please! Someone! We need help!"
"66848564-0-7323";"Crow-friend, a word!"
"66848564-0-7324";"Damn you, Gascone."
"66848564-0-7334";"Is this how machines feel as their gears wind down?"
"66848564-0-7336";"Got a job for someone who don't mind getting their shoes wet!"
"66848564-0-7337";"Looking for a steady hand with a pickaxe ready!"
"66848564-0-7338";"Looking for a harvester with some guts!"
"66848564-0-7339";"Looking for a forester in need of some extra gold!"
"66848564-0-7340";"Want to help Slag Town become a little more enchanting?"
"66848564-0-7341";"Any alchemists looking for some gold?"
"66848564-0-7344";"I shouldn't have let Variah go in there alone."
"66848564-0-7345";"Damn these shadows …. We have to get to the Cogitum!"
"66848564-0-7346";"The Shadow's got to be approaching the throne by now. We have to hurry."
"66848564-0-7347";"Let us speak."
"66848564-0-7348";"Allies …. We need allies."
"66848564-0-7349";"Come, shadow slayer. We have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-7350";"Greetings, sera. A moment, if you please."
"66848564-0-7352";"This year he'll select me for sure, I can feel the gears rotating in my direction!"
"66848564-0-7355";"Crows …. Why crows?"
"66848564-0-7359";"Someone! Anyone? We need help here!"
"66848564-0-7360";"Another newcomer, eh? Come! Let's talk."
"66848564-0-7361";"By the Eight, I swear I'll destroy every one of these blasted machines if I have to! Somehow …."
"66848564-0-7369";"Come. We need to talk."
"66848564-0-7370";"You don't look pallid—or dead—enough to be with this lot. I could use your help."
"66848564-0-7372";"We'll never put a stop to the disease at this rate."
"66848564-0-7376";"Crow-friend, the Court requires your services!"
"66848564-0-7377";"What an auspicious occasion! What an incredible find!"
"66848564-0-7379";"Damn these shadows …. We have to get to the Cogitum!"
"66848564-0-7382";"Crow-friend, the Court has need of your services!"
"66848564-0-7383";"The attentive bird catches the worm, crow-friend."
"66848564-0-7384";"What audacity! Crow-friend, a word!"
"66848564-0-7386";"There has to be someone willing to help us."
"66848564-0-7389";"Capable combatants needed for hazardous work. Please respond for more information."
"66848564-0-7390";"Combatants needed for a perilous task. Please respond for more information."
"66848564-0-7392";"I hope we didn't lose another one to the Shadow Cleft."
"66848564-0-7393";"The initiate forgot his tabulator. How careless of him."
"66848564-0-7394";"To think the Halls of Regulation would get to this state."
"66848564-0-7395";"You. Newcomer. You appear to need direction."
"66848564-0-7396";"These reports will be the death of me …."
"66848564-0-7397";"Newcomer, are you ready to administer justice?"
"66848564-0-7398";"Gryphon feathers, of all the things."
"66848564-0-7399";"Now we're entrusting our dead to the hands of nebarra."
"66848564-0-7400";"Keelsplitter? These sailors and their pet names …."
"66848564-0-7401";"Someone must be willing to change these filters."
"66848564-0-7402";"Now if I can just find someone willing to deal with the maintenance factotums."
"66848564-0-7404";"There haven't been pilgrims in some time. I'm afraid you've come in vain."
"66848564-0-7424";"No respect. No respect at all! Crow-friend, a word!"
"66848564-0-7425";"The arrogance! A crow enjoys play as much as the next bird!"
"66848564-0-7426";"Friend of Valsirenn, we have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-7427";"Crow-friend, a word!"
"66848564-0-7428";"Crow-friend, the Court requires your services!"
"66848564-0-7430";"You have to believe me. You've imprisoned an innocent man!"
"66848564-0-7432";"Still nothing! Valsirenn, add your divination spell and see if that reveals anything useful."
"66848564-0-7433";"We should talk, my friend."
"66848564-0-7434";"Drat. Which one could he possibly be?"
"66848564-0-7435";"Stop it, now! Come to your senses!"
"66848564-0-7436";"Mara, help me …. Mara, help me find my son!"
"66848564-0-7438";"Did you hear that weeping again? I've had enough of this place …."
"66848564-0-7439";"Wherever could that blasted mercenary be?"
"66848564-0-7441";"That is it! I'm done with this mad forest!"
"66848564-0-7442";"Lotus! Lotus! Where are you precious?"
"66848564-0-7446";"We need to rally our forces, my friend."
"66848564-0-7447";"We're running out of time, my friend."
"66848564-0-7448";"Someone with flesh on their bones! Thank Mauloch."
"66848564-0-7450";"Who wouldn't want such a cozy little home?"
"66848564-0-7451";"No, that won't do. The color must be vibrant!"
"66848564-0-7454";"That storm's worsening by the second. We're running out of time."
"66848564-0-7457";"The more we learn, the more the nature of the threat becomes clear."
"66848564-0-7458";"All are welcome to celebrate the New Life!"
"66848564-0-7460";"I'm sorry, Lorne, but I'm too old and I know too much. We need an impartial eye."
"66848564-0-7461";"Hmm. Most troubling, most troubling."
"66848564-0-7463";"I knew I shouldn't have let her go in. Idiot."
"66848564-0-7465";"No, no, these models just won't do."
"66848564-0-7466";"These blasted guards! Perhaps there's a window … no, that won't do."
"66848564-0-7467";"How can Rigurt negotiate peace if stupid High Elves won't talk to him?"
"66848564-0-7468";"My memories … what else have I forgotten?"
"66848564-0-7469";"Come on, you filthy—you're no Goblin."
"66848564-0-7471";"I have to … keep awake …. The squad …."
"66848564-0-7473";"You there! I do say, you there!"
"66848564-0-7478";"Ahoy! Traveler! Spare a moment for a question in passing?"
"66848564-0-7479";"Why, look at that. It seems help has arrived after all."
"66848564-0-7481";"By Mauloch, that scrawny beanpole is going to get it …."
"66848564-0-7484";"Work for outsiders! The Divine Prosecution requests aid!"
"66848564-0-7485";"We still have work to do, my friend."
"66848564-0-7488";"The Office of Divine Prosecution seeks deputies with moral aptitude!"
"66848564-0-7489";"The Office of Divine Prosecution seeks a temporary botanical assistant!"
"66848564-0-7490";"Don't merely be a visitor to Summerset! Help uphold its justice!"
"66848564-0-7491";"A request from the Office of Divine Prosecution! Animal handling desired!"
"66848564-0-7492";"The Office of Divine Prosecution requires strong-minded assistants!"
"66848564-0-7494";"A thousand curses on you, Madja!"
"66848564-0-7497";"After all that's happened, Summerset remains in danger …."
"66848564-0-7498";"A thousand pardons, but the Battlereeve requires your prompt appearance at the Proxy Queen's court."
"66848564-0-7499";"The news from the Queen's Eye. Could it really be true?"
"66848564-0-7500";"Ah, a fellow warrior! Come! Let us talk!"
"66848564-0-7503";"Summerset requires your services again, friend of Razum-dar."
"66848564-0-7507";"Finally! I was beginning to think you'd never show up here!"
"66848564-0-7508";"Friend of Valsirenn. I have a proposal for you."
"66848564-0-7510";"Honestly, I think she plans to do something rash. She might even attack the guards! Ugh. Nebarra …."
"66848564-0-7511";"You there! Do something useful and come help me!"
"66848564-0-7512";"Come on Alamar, pull yourself together."
"66848564-0-7516";"What kind of monster arranges acacias and begonias in the same beds?"
"66848564-0-7517";"I was hoping you'd wander by. I could really use your help right about now."
"66848564-0-7519";"There you are! The Ritemaster has been waiting for you to return."
"66848564-0-7520";"Didn't those idiots ever learn how to run properly?"
"66848564-0-7521";"You there. Come. I need assistance."
"66848564-0-7522";"Initiate? A word?"
"66848564-0-7526";"Are you ready to set out again?"
"66848564-0-7527";"These curs think they can break me?"
"66848564-0-7533";"Initiate—a moment?"
"66848564-0-7537";"Travelers? Now? Of all the times!"
"66848564-0-7540";"Cloudrest destroyed by shadows … could it be true?"
"66848564-0-7541";"Initiate, we still have much to do."
"66848564-0-7542";"The answers are within our grasp, I know it …."
"66848564-0-7543";"One task yet remains, initiate."
"66848564-0-7544";"Initiate, I require your assistance."
"66848564-0-7545";"Initiate—a word."
"66848564-0-7546";"We must act quickly!"
"66848564-0-7551";"Seeking a sip of fine Russafeld red? Prepare for disappointment."
"66848564-0-7554";"This is what dealing with High Elf nobles gets you, Brengas!"
"66848564-0-7555";"I have a message for you, my friend."
"66848564-0-7558";"Over here. There is much to do, my friend."
"66848564-0-7559";"There you are!"
"66848564-0-7560";"Over here! We must speak!"
"66848564-0-7561";"Where have you been, my friend?"
"66848564-0-7562";"Ah! A wanderer—just the person I need to speak with!"
"66848564-0-7563";"There you are! The Ritemaster sent me to find you."
"66848564-0-7564";"There you are! And just in time!"
"66848564-0-7565";"There you are. I could use your help."
"66848564-0-7566";"There you are! Such perfect timing!"
"66848564-0-7567";"We still have work to do. my friend."
"66848564-0-7568";"Over here! I have a message for you!"
"66848564-0-7570";"Ulliceta … what are you thinking?"
"66848564-0-7571";"Summerset requires your services again, friend of Razum-dar."
"66848564-0-7599";"You, there! How would you like to do something worthwhile?"
"66848564-0-7605";"Gold for favors! Over here!"
"66848564-0-7606";"Over here, ojel!"
"66848564-0-7607";"Who wants to assist the Naga-Kur?"
"66848564-0-7608";"The Naga-Kur need no help. But if you insist …."
"66848564-0-7609";"Who will step forward for the Naga-Kur?"
"66848564-0-7610";"Ojel, come here now!"
"66848564-0-7614";"Get back! You will not cut the scales from me again!"
"66848564-0-7615";"Beeko-friend, over here! Will you speak with me?"
"66848564-0-7616";"Come. We have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-7617";"Ready for another adventure, my friend?"
"66848564-0-7618";"Hey, swamp slug! Over here."
"66848564-0-7619";"Kassandra has a head start. We must hurry, beeko!"
"66848564-0-7620";"I guess it's up to us now …."
"66848564-0-7621";"I think we can help the souls inside the Remnant. I think that's what we're supposed to do."
"66848564-0-7622";"Adventure! Discovery! Join Cyrodilic Collections!"
"66848564-0-7625";"Need someone with no fear and a strong back. That you?"
"66848564-0-7626";"I've got a job for you, if you're interested."
"66848564-0-7633";"Come work for Cyrodilic Collections! We pay for services rendered!"
"66848564-0-7635";"Friend, Cyrodilic Collections has a job for you!"
"66848564-0-7636";"I just don't understand. Who wouldn't want to join such a great expedition?"
"66848564-0-7637";"My friend! Care to help our great organization with a bug problem?"
"66848564-0-7638";"Ruheeva! Welcome! Don't think I've seen you here before."
"66848564-0-7640";"Make whatever preparations you must, Famia. The time has come."
"66848564-0-7641";"Friend, Cyrodilic Collections has a job for you!"
"66848564-0-7642";"Ah, you've arrived just in time! Care to help Cyrodilic Collections once more?"
"66848564-0-7644";"My friend, so good to see you! Care to help our expedition once more?"
"66848564-0-7645";"I have work, and I'm not particular about who takes the job."
"66848564-0-7646";"Beeko! Can we speak? I have a business opportunity!"
"66848564-0-7648";"Hey! Over here, swamp slug."
"66848564-0-7649";"Ready for another adventure, my friend?"
"66848564-0-7650";"New blood! You are needed once again. Come, speak!"
"66848564-0-7651";"You superstitious? Got work if you've got the guts for it."
"66848564-0-7652";"Need someone who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty. That you?"
"66848564-0-7653";"How dare they take Seeks like that! Oh, whatever am I going to do …."
"66848564-0-7654";"I need to get these calendar tablets back."
"66848564-0-7655";"How good it is to see all of the tablets back in their proper place!"
"66848564-0-7656";"I need to get these calendar tablets back."
"66848564-0-7660";"Varona! Drooler! Where are you two?"
"66848564-0-7661";"All right, Chuxu. You can do this. You can do this!"
"66848564-0-7662";"By the Hist, whatever will I do?"
"66848564-0-7663";"Friend of Xukas! A moment, please!"
"66848564-0-7664";"I'll need help gathering all of the components …."
"66848564-0-7666";"Gargh—grrrl—ahhhgh. Mmm! Mmm, mmm!"
"66848564-0-7668";"Join me, ojel. I've been waiting."
"66848564-0-7670";"Our wounds fester and supplies are short. Whatever are we to do?"
"66848564-0-7671";"Hmm. The Blight Bog? Whoever will agree to travel there …."
"66848564-0-7672";"Those poor envoys. How could this happen?"
"66848564-0-7673";"Our offerings! Oh, whatever shall we do …."
"66848564-0-7674";"Hackwing leather? Who will help us gather such a thing …."
"66848564-0-7682";"Walker! New Blood! Come quick!"
"66848564-0-7683";"By the moons! You're alive!"
"66848564-0-7684";"Walker! Where have you been?"
"66848564-0-7686";"A word, five-claw."
"66848564-0-7688";"There you are. Took you long enough."
"66848564-0-7690";"Excuse me, please. I have a message for you!"
"66848564-0-7691";"I wonder where he could have gotten to."
"66848564-0-7692";"Don't worry, sweet boy. Numaia won't let anything happen to you."
"66848564-0-7693";"Be still now. You must save your strength."
"66848564-0-7694";"We cannot wait any longer, Silhu-jo. This one must do something!"
"66848564-0-7695";"Well, aren't you off in a hurry?"
"66848564-0-7696";"A surgical assault. It's the only option, Lord Speaker."
"66848564-0-7697";"Hrrm. So many crises to deal with …."
"66848564-0-7698";"When you have a moment, we should really discuss preparations for our journey."
"66848564-0-7699";"Perhaps a direct approach would be the best?"
"66848564-0-7700";"In need of gold, walker? Spare this one a moment."
"66848564-0-7701";"Watch your step in the Stitches."
"66848564-0-7703";"Ja-Kha'jay, light my path through this madness!"
"66848564-0-7704";"Greetings, walker. Have you a moment to speak?"
"66848564-0-7705";"Ah, yes, the one who approaches might help us with your artifacts!"
"66848564-0-7706";"Time to hunt the hunters, Sarazi. Weak quarry, no glory!"
"66848564-0-7707";"Oh, I hope no one's hurt. This one shudders to think of the damage the beast could do."
"66848564-0-7711";"Blessing be upon you, rhook. Have you a moment to talk?"
"66848564-0-7712";"To fight Dragons, we must first fight Daedra? Of course."
"66848564-0-7714";"That's it! The mural is complete."
"66848564-0-7716";"Azura. Is this truly the path you set me on?"
"66848564-0-7717";"This temple holds the answers, I know it."
"66848564-0-7718";"We should examine that blade of yours. It could be the key to all this."
"66848564-0-7721";"Ziss'vo! I'll show that old bully!"
"66848564-0-7723";"Five-claw, a moment, please."
"66848564-0-7725";"What is this one to do with such unbloodied recruits?"
"66848564-0-7731";"Oy! Wanderer! You have some time?"
"66848564-0-7736";"A moment, please!"
"66848564-0-7737";"Walker, one more thing."
"66848564-0-7741";"A meeting with my half-sister? Why didn't I think of that?"
"66848564-0-7742";"I wonder who I can get to help me."
"66848564-0-7744";"Wait, please! This one needs help!"
"66848564-0-7745";"More and more recruits come, but how are we to train them?"
"66848564-0-7746";"Is Zahari expected to train all these recruits herself?"
"66848564-0-7747";"However will we train so many recruits?"
"66848564-0-7748";"We must quickly train these recruits if they're going to survive."
"66848564-0-7749";"Is this scroll truly worth it? By Jone and Jode!"
"66848564-0-7750";"A Nordic crypt? Who will travel to such a place?"
"66848564-0-7751";"Zahari prays this scroll is worth it."
"66848564-0-7764";"There must be someone who can get rid of you. Er…help you."
"66848564-0-7766";"Time is short, five-claw."
"66848564-0-7767";"This one has had enough of those dungy cultists!"
"66848564-0-7769";"The Euraxians will be here soon, Gharesh-ri."
"66848564-0-7770";"These Dragons are fast becoming a larger issue."
"66848564-0-7771";"Over here, five-claw!"
"66848564-0-7772";"Trust me, he said. Believe in our Lord of Infection and Pestilence, he said."
"66848564-0-7773";"Psst, five-claw! This one has a message for you."
"66848564-0-7774";"Walker! You have a moment to spare, yes?"
"66848564-0-7775";"Ziss'vo! So much work, and our paws are so few!"
"66848564-0-7776";"By Jone and Jode—so much work to do!"
"66848564-0-7777";"Walker! Do not be shy. Come, come!"
"66848564-0-7778";"Bright Moons, walker! Come, speak with Nisuzi!"
"66848564-0-7781";"Careful where you flaunt your wealth, walker. You are a tempting prize indeed!"
"66848564-0-7783";"Psst! Five-claw, over here!"
"66848564-0-7787";"Five-claw, over here!"
"66848564-0-7788";"Ah, there you are."
"66848564-0-7789";"Shor's Bones! Rigurt knew he should have brought more mead."
"66848564-0-7790";"Maces, swords, axes … whatever happened to bludgeoning someone to death with a wheel of cheese?"
"66848564-0-7791";"Don't be sad, horse friend. Gordon will come home soon."
"66848564-0-7793";"Guess not all Khajiit adepts are peace-loving furballs. Wonder who'll take this one down."
"66848564-0-7794";"Peerless blade my big toe …."
"66848564-0-7795";"We'll pluck that bird's feathers one way or another."
"66848564-0-7796";"Five-claw, I have news!"
"66848564-0-7797";"Are Dragons not enough? Now we deal with dro-m'Athra, too! Ziss'vo!"
"66848564-0-7799";"Always with the necromancy … ziss'vo!"
"66848564-0-7800";"Filthy, sour criminals! They'll be sorry …."
"66848564-0-7801";"Over here. This one has a message for you."
"66848564-0-7802";"Why can't the dead ever stay dead around here?"
"66848564-0-7804";"We need to stop these Dragons before they spread outside of Elsweyr."
"66848564-0-7808";"No good can come of that place."
"66848564-0-7809";"Shh, stay down!"
"66848564-0-7810";"You'd think she was possessed or something."
"66848564-0-7816";"I have a task for you, hunter."
"66848564-0-7818";"The glyphs hold the key …."
"66848564-0-7819";"Traveler, a moment of your time?"
"66848564-0-7821";"There must be a way to reach Dragonhold."
"66848564-0-7823";"This may be the first Dragon we face together. Leki willing, it won't be the last."
"66848564-0-7824";"Your next mission awaits, my friend."
"66848564-0-7825";"You! Over here, quickly!"
"66848564-0-7828";"Damned birds …."
"66848564-0-7829";"Damned dungy birds!"
"66848564-0-7831";"Over here, walker!"
"66848564-0-7832";"We must speak about the attack on Pridehome."
"66848564-0-7833";"Our task isn't done yet, Dragonguard. Let's discuss our next step."
"66848564-0-7834";"Dragonguard! Come here! Need your beating skills!"
"66848564-0-7835";"Get over here. Got an errand for you."
"66848564-0-7838";"I have a task, my friend. Come, we should speak."
"66848564-0-7841";"Dark Moons, what could wash away the stench of such soured sugar?"
"66848564-0-7842";"Warrior! May we speak?"
"66848564-0-7850";"I'm here, mother. What do you want from me?"
"66848564-0-7851";"Hear ye, adventurers! Come and find an honest day's work!"
"66848564-0-7853";"Of course a killer's settled in right where a rare plant grows. Hope I can find people to handle this."
"66848564-0-7854";"You'd think Goutfangs would respect folk trying to keep people fed."
"66848564-0-7855";"Easy job, my arse. Meridian temple guardians scarred me more times than I can count."
"66848564-0-7856";"Scholars. Huh. This one should've done more research into how not to die."
"66848564-0-7857";"Shortcut, my arse. Now we're down arrows thanks to some temple guardian."
"66848564-0-7860";"Time to earn your keep, Dragonguard."
"66848564-0-7861";"Hey, Dragonguard. Need you for a spot of looting."
"66848564-0-7862";"A little help over here."
"66848564-0-7863";"Jobs aplenty for willing adventurers! Come, heroes, and speak to Guybert!"
"66848564-0-7864";"Come, adventurers! Guybert has more than enough work to go around!"
"66848564-0-7865";"New Moon, new problems."
"66848564-0-7866";"Damned lizards. Chizbari will make them pay."
"66848564-0-7867";"Damned lizards. Chizbari will make them pay."
"66848564-0-7868";"Steady coin for steady work! Come! Speak to Guybert!"
"66848564-0-7869";"You there! Yes, you! Looking for work?"
"66848564-0-7870";"Heroes seeking fame and fortune, come and speak to Guybert!"
"66848564-0-7873";"I knew if my concoction worked in Skyrim, it would certainly work in Elsweyr!"
"66848564-0-7879";"Please, over here!"
"66848564-0-7880";"Apparently, my bodyguard fell asleep on the job. Again."
"66848564-0-7888";"Hmm. This is bad. Very bad."
"66848564-0-7889";"Hey, walker! Over here!"
"66848564-0-7890";"Dragonguard, over here!"
"66848564-0-7891";"There you are! Walker, over here!"
"66848564-0-7892";"What a waste. What a damn waste!"
"66848564-0-7893";"Ah! There you are."
"66848564-0-7894";"Where's that help I was promised? I can't deal with this on my own."
"66848564-0-7895";"Hold, adventurer! You're the one I seek."
"66848564-0-7898";"Hey walker! I have another message."
"66848564-0-7899";"Hey, Dragonguard!  Over here!"
"66848564-0-7901";"My father won't act, so I will!"
"66848564-0-7902";"Well, if it isn't her majesty's most sought-after soobor—subor—servant."
"66848564-0-7904";"You there! Please! I need help!"
"66848564-0-7907";"I … I have something to talk to you about."
"66848564-0-7908";"Over here, my friend. Time is short."
"66848564-0-7912";"You there! You're the first person we've seen in days!"
"66848564-0-7913";"Father, how could you?"
"66848564-0-7914";"This whole situation, almost makes me want to relinquish the key to my grog cellar. Almost."
"66848564-0-7915";"Another survivor? Meridia be praised!"
"66848564-0-7916";"First time in a princess's chamber, my friend?"
"66848564-0-7918";"Friend … I need your help …."
"66848564-0-7919";"The coven has more planned for Solitude than what we found here, of that I'm certain."
"66848564-0-7920";"It's all gone. Damn it, brother, where are you?"
"66848564-0-7921";"Wait, but what do I see? Brave soul, a word!"
"66848564-0-7925";"Damn. Another dead soldier and no sign of our supplies."
"66848564-0-7928";"Thirty-seven—ah! Dammit. Thirty-eight."
"66848564-0-7929";"I'm free. I can't believe I'm free of her."
"66848564-0-7930";"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please don't make me do this."
"66848564-0-7931";"Hey, partner. Let's talk."
"66848564-0-7933";"Where's that caravan? It should have arrived by now."
"66848564-0-7937";"The Tower of the Wolf … I think we should let it crumble."
"66848564-0-7938";"She-giant's friend, a word!"
"66848564-0-7939";"Get back here this instant, you old fossil! Who do you think you're fooling?"
"66848564-0-7941";"A joyous day for the Bards College!"
"66848564-0-7944";"You best turn around and head back the way you came, traveler. It's not safe here."
"66848564-0-7945";"What are simple folk supposed to do against such evil?"
"66848564-0-7953";"The Chillwind Depths, they aren't safe, traveler."
"66848564-0-7954";"Please, can anybody help us?"
"66848564-0-7956";"Have a passion for alchemy? Be a part of my exciting research!"
"66848564-0-7957";"Who's up for a archeology? Anyone?"
"66848564-0-7958";"Seeking a reliable research assistant with little to no fear of death!"
"66848564-0-7959";"You don't look sick. Do you need a place to stay?"
"66848564-0-7960";"Orkey take you no good, hork-arsed bastards! Straight to Oblivion!"
"66848564-0-7961";"Lord, Mother, and Wizard! What is wrong with this place?"
"66848564-0-7962";"Ah, there you are!"
"66848564-0-7963";"You! Down here, I have need of your assistance!"
"66848564-0-7964";"Finally! Do you know how long I've been standing here?"
"66848564-0-7965";"Ah, a fine hero appears in my hour of need! You there, I require your assistance!"
"66848564-0-7968";"Just think, current Rigurt! What would past Rigurt do?"
"66848564-0-7975";"Wolf attacks? Ghosts? Reachmen raids? I'm getting out of this town."
"66848564-0-7982";"Sailing Giants. I'd have never imagined."
"66848564-0-7983";"Aren't you supposed to be in Riften?"
"66848564-0-7985";"Over here!"
"66848564-0-7986";"Quickly! Over here!"
"66848564-0-7987";"I'm glad I found you."
"66848564-0-7990";"Hold up there, young blood."
"66848564-0-7991";"Another day, another failure. It must be somewhere."
"66848564-0-7992";"What's this? A new antiquarian in the making?"
"66848564-0-7993";"If only I could master it. Maybe then I could find him."
"66848564-0-7994";"I bear a message, friend of Fennorian!"
"66848564-0-7995";"Fennorian's friend! Over here!"
"66848564-0-7997";"Ugh! Stupid thing! I should have never come out here alone …."
"66848564-0-7998";"Couldn't have just been plain old wolves, oh no."
"66848564-0-7999";"Orcs. If they aren't fighting, they're fighting about fighting."
"66848564-0-8000";"I did what she hired me to do. No sense in feeling guilty for not doing more."
"66848564-0-8001";"Where are the Nords who have no fear of the witchery of the Reach?"
"66848564-0-8002";"I have a unique opportunity for scholastic research today. It'll keep you warm!"
"66848564-0-8005";"Are you an individual with a love of tinkering, or a lot of pent up aggression?"
"66848564-0-8006";"If you have any experience with jails, or escapes, I could make use of it!"
"66848564-0-8008";"I need someone who isn't afraid of the dark, or much of anything for that matter."
"66848564-0-8009";"All right, Antiquarian. Are you ready to begin?"
"66848564-0-8010";"Why couldn't the Dwarves' infernal contraptions vanish along with them?"
"66848564-0-8011";"Another day, another infernal harrowstorm."
"66848564-0-8020";"Borfree? Is that you? Whoever you are, come help me this instant!"
"66848564-0-8025";"Oh, poor Hedrynne. I told them to avoid that dreadful place!"
"66848564-0-8027";"You! Down here, I have need of your assistance!"
"66848564-0-8035";"What are you doing down here, Rada?"
"66848564-0-8036";"Welcome back to the sky above, harrier."
"66848564-0-8037";"Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!"
"66848564-0-8040";"You there! Looking for me?"
"66848564-0-8042";"What are you planning, Rada?"
"66848564-0-8043";"The time has come, my friend. Let us speak."
"66848564-0-8044";"Over here! Your favorite yet overqualified messenger brings news!"
"66848564-0-8047";"Oh, Verandis, why didn't you tell us?"
"66848564-0-8048";"There you are. Didn't they ever teach you not to keep a woman waiting?"
"66848564-0-8053";"The Darkstorm has begun."
"66848564-0-8054";"It's now or never, hero."
"66848564-0-8055";"Closer. Come closer. Let me see your face."
"66848564-0-8056";"Damn it, where are they?"
"66848564-0-8057";"Oh, what new horror has that storm unleashed upon us now?"
"66848564-0-8059";"Do I hear the pitter-patter of little scamp feet?"
"66848564-0-8066";"Hey, partner, over here!"
"66848564-0-8067";"On your way to Markarth, harrier?"
"66848564-0-8073";"Oh, master, where are you?"
"66848564-0-8087";"I don't shirk from tough situations, but that cat asks the impossible!"
"66848564-0-8088";"Damn the Thornroot clan! Damn them all!"
"66848564-0-8092";"A solemn Old Life to you, traveler!"
"66848564-0-8094";"You! I've been looking for you."
"66848564-0-8096";"Well, look who it is."
"66848564-0-8097";"A solemn Old Life to you once more, friend."
"66848564-0-8108";"The Wayward Guardians grow in number. And so does our need to arm them."
"66848564-0-8109";"Silver. Perhaps the one true protection against vampires and werewolves. We need more of it."
"66848564-0-8110";"The Wayward Guardians have need of you, harrier."
"66848564-0-8112";"Vile monsters lurk beneath our very feet. They must be slain!"
"66848564-0-8113";"The witches have spoken. Something stirs in the deep."
"66848564-0-8114";"A sacred shrine still stands in the Lost Valley. It must not be forgotten."
"66848564-0-8115";"Even exiles deserve a better fate than that."
"66848564-0-8117";"Why do I always have to deliver the messages?"
"66848564-0-8118";"Over here! I've been looking for you."
"66848564-0-8119";"It's about damn time …."
"66848564-0-8120";"Hunt-Father. I begin to see. You test us, don't you?"
"66848564-0-8121";"Closer. Come closer. Let me see your face."
"66848564-0-8124";"Leave it to an outsider to bring a curse down upon a sacred shrine …."
"66848564-0-8125";"Yes, yes, my vision-dream speaks true! You are the one my mistress seeks!"
"66848564-0-8126";"A word, mercenary."
"66848564-0-8129";"Hey, partner, over here!"
"66848564-0-8130";"Mercenary, we have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-8132";"All right, we still have a lot of work to do."
"66848564-0-8133";"Kaoc! Is this all that's left of us? We won't survive much more of this."
"66848564-0-8136";"Oh, perhaps this bazaar isn't so empty after all. Have a word, friend?"
"66848564-0-8137";"Stranger, I am in need of your help."
"66848564-0-8138";"What a sodding disaster …."
"66848564-0-8139";"Hold, traveler! Borderwatch isn't safe."
"66848564-0-8141";"Looks like the person who hired me has a few secrets of his own."
"66848564-0-8142";"Oh, hello! Can you come over here and help me?"
"66848564-0-8147";"Hello, hello! This one has just the thing to put some swagger in your step for these festivities!"
"66848564-0-8148";"If it isn't my favorite apple-picker!"
"66848564-0-8149";"Was this the place? Hey there, little leaf. Is this the Silent Halls? Hello?"
"66848564-0-8153";"Uncertainty. Fear. Death. The will of Sithis cannot be ignored."
"66848564-0-8158";"Hey! Hey you! Interested in some real Jester's Festival fun?"
"66848564-0-8159";"Hey friend! Over here!"
"66848564-0-8160";"You there, strapping traveler! Do you have a moment?"
"66848564-0-8164";"Would you care to help a friend receive a blessing?"
"66848564-0-8165";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8167";"I should sail out of here and never look back."
"66848564-0-8171";"Hail, wayfarer …."
"66848564-0-8172";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8173";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8174";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8175";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8176";"Want to prove yourself?"
"66848564-0-8181";"Beeko, over here. Rockgrove begs for your aid."
"66848564-0-8188";"Ugh. Again?"
"66848564-0-8189";"Oh, hey, one more thing!"
"66848564-0-8195";"Over here, mercenary! I have news."
"66848564-0-8196";"Mercenary, we should talk!"
"66848564-0-8197";"Mercenary, we must speak."
"66848564-0-8198";"Over here, mercenary!"
"66848564-0-8199";"You have a moment? Something's come up."
"66848564-0-8200";"Does crawling around creepy caves sound like your idea of a good time? Then I have a job for you!"
"66848564-0-8203";"Can you write legibly in the face of danger? Want to get paid for it? Come speak with me!"
"66848564-0-8204";"Hold, adventurer! A moment, please."
"66848564-0-8205";"Adventurer, let us speak."
"66848564-0-8206";"Xi-Tsei. If your path leads to that nest of stone, stranger, I have a request to make of you."
"66848564-0-8207";"Adventurer, a word please!"
"66848564-0-8208";"Ah, mercenary, there you are!"
"66848564-0-8209";"Adventurer, I bring glad tidings!"
"66848564-0-8214";"This worm will see which is harder to bear, her guilt or my wrath."
"66848564-0-8216";"You there. I have something for you."
"66848564-0-8218";"If you have opinions about crows, I have got a job for you."
"66848564-0-8219";"There are many people in Leyawiin who need help. I have a job for you, if you are interested."
"66848564-0-8220";"Fancy yourself a friend to all bugs? I know some that need your help!"
"66848564-0-8223";"Never thought I'd still be alive to see the end. Yet here we are."
"66848564-0-8224";"Kaoc! Is this all that's left of us? We won't survive much more of this."
"66848564-0-8236";"The rushing waters, the whorls of ripples and currents, many tongues. Fascinating."
"66848564-0-8245";"You, reveler! Come speak with me."
"66848564-0-8247";"Mortal, a word."
"66848564-0-8250";"Come, mortal, we have much to discuss."
"66848564-0-8251";"We cannot allow Mehrunes Dagon's servants to possess the Anchorite."
"66848564-0-8252";"The Dread Lady described you well. Come and speak with me."
"66848564-0-8257";"There is more to do, little mortal."
"66848564-0-8258";"The Dread Lady demands an audience, adventurer."
"66848564-0-8262";"Ah, child! Come, come. I have news."
"66848564-0-8264";"Come, little mortal. Let us speak."
"66848564-0-8278";"A festival for jesters and the only fools I see are those in the audience. Don't these idiots know how to indulge?"
"66848564-0-8280";"Little mortal, attend me."
"66848564-0-8292";"You there, the Grasp requests your aid."
"66848564-0-8293";"Mortal! Heed me!"
"66848564-0-8296";"Exotic locales? No, no, that's all wrong!"
"66848564-0-8303";"Hey! Hey, it's me, Calonir! Remember?"
"66848564-0-8305";"You there. Come speak with me."
"66848564-0-8312";"Hey, Nirnling! Yes, you! I've got a message for you."
"66848564-0-8315";"You are requested to appear before the Dread Lady, adventurer."
"66848564-0-8316";"Over here, mortal."
"66848564-0-8317";"Why must I always be the one to fetch you, mortal?"
"66848564-0-8325";"Oh my! Another mortal! Come, you must hear this!"
"66848564-0-8326";"Another message for you, mortal."
"66848564-0-8329";"Your hands know the value of hard work. Come here, dear-heart, and listen to what I have to say."
"66848564-0-8333";"Hey, over here!"
"66848564-0-8337";"We have a mystery to solve, my dear."
"66848564-0-8338";"A traveler? Over here! I can't go in there alone!"
"66848564-0-8339";"Woe be unto this place!"
"66848564-0-8340";"Well, I shouldn't just walk into someone's home, even if they were rude …."
"66848564-0-8342";"Over here! I could use your help."
"66848564-0-8344";"I must be going insane. A skull? But … it talked. It talked!"
"66848564-0-8346";"If you're quite ready, my dears, I believe it's time to finish this business."
"66848564-0-8349";"Ahoy! Have a moment for a sailor seeking their fortune?"
"66848564-0-8350";"Ahem. You there. Here, please."
"66848564-0-8352";"The time has come to find the missing alliance leaders."
"66848564-0-8354";"Over here, dear. We have more work to do."
"66848564-0-8356";"This isn't over yet, my friend."
"66848564-0-8359";"Hey there! Over here!"
"66848564-0-8361";"I must discover the source of this corruption."
"66848564-0-8364";"Lost another one. What could it be?"
"66848564-0-8365";"Over here, friend! No rest for the weary."
"66848564-0-8366";"No ship. No Oblan. No idea where to start. Excellent."
"66848564-0-8371";"This is not good. Rigurt needs help. Again."
"66848564-0-8377";"Before we go our separate ways, can I ask one more favor of you?"
"66848564-0-8378";"Got time for one more task, good-looking?"
"66848564-0-8380";"Attention, marine! There's fighting to be done."
"66848564-0-8383";"House Dufort seeks able marines to drive the Sea Elf menace from our shores!"
"66848564-0-8394";"I could use your help for one last thing."
"66848564-0-8399";"Ahem. You there. Here, please."
"66848564-0-8400";"Ahem. You there. Here, please."
"66848564-0-8405";"Hey, over here!"
"66848564-0-8411";"Over here, good-looking!"
"66848564-0-8418";"0"
"66848564-0-8423";"We could make a good deal of coin with that drink if you control yourself! Ugh!"
"66848564-0-8429";"0"
"66848564-0-8445";"There you are!"
"66848564-0-8457";"Pull yourself together, mate. We've exploring to do!"
"66848564-0-8460";"Well, I shouldn't just walk into someone's home, even if they were rude …."
"66848564-0-8461";"It's such a good idea … I just need a little bit of assistance …."
"66848564-0-8466";"Perhaps they will get bored of Raz? One can only hope."
"66848564-0-8474";"House Mornard needs adventurers! Who's got the sand for the job?"
"66848564-0-8476";"Remember, Taz, a Dragon could swoop down at any moment! Stay vigilant."
"66848564-0-8477";"Mourning will have to wait. We have work to do, my friend."
"66848564-0-8478";"There must be something we can do to keep both Frii and the prisoners safe."
"66848564-0-8481";"We aren't done with this business quite yet, my dear."
"66848564-0-8484";"Vastyr stands in the eye of a gathering storm. We must speak."
"66848564-0-8491";"Don't just repeat yourself, stupid bird! Help me!"
"66848564-0-8493";"Mohair, I know you're hungry, but my robes aren't for eating. Oh, maybe they can help us!"
"66848564-0-8529";"We finally have a moment to think, but there's still work to do."
"66848564-0-8541";"House Mornard needs adventurers! Who's got the sand for the job?"
"66848564-0-8547";"Tides go in, tides go out. Oh, you there, can you see me?"
"66848564-0-8548";"Over here, mercenary!"
"66848564-0-8607";"Hey, mate! Looks like Sir Stefan needs us again!"
"66848564-0-8609";"House Mornard needs adventurers! Who's got the sand for the job?"
"66848564-0-8617";"Mortal, why do you bear the mark of the Great Eye?"
"66848564-0-8621";"Where are all the workers? The overseer was supposed to meet me hours ago!"
"66848564-0-8622";"Why are all the writs for heavily guarded fetchers?"
"66848564-0-8625";"You! Traveler! Over here!"
"66848564-0-8627";"Ho there! Traveler! Can you help me?"
"66848564-0-8636";"Brigands. Scoundrels. Fleshy constructs."
"66848564-0-8638";"Ah, an adventurer. Would you spare a moment for a cipher in need?"
"66848564-0-8642";"I can't believe she just threw me out! What am I going to do?"
"66848564-0-8656";"If you're willing to work, I'm ready to hire."
"66848564-0-8658";"Feh. I could seek help in Necrom, or … you there!"
"66848564-0-8659";"No, no, no! The Master of Secrets will certainly flay me for this!"
"66848564-0-8685";"All right, that should be far enough from the study."
"66848564-0-8689";"Twelvane doesn't know if you can hear her. Help is coming, Vanton."
"66848564-0-8692";"Can anyone help me? I don't want to live in a nightmare!"
"66848564-0-8693";"Temple jobs available here!"
"66848564-0-8694";"Sacred work! It pays well!"
"66848564-0-8695";"Adventurers wanted! Apply here!"
"66848564-0-8696";"Temple jobs available here!"
"66848564-0-8697";"Sacred work! It pays well!"
"66848564-0-8698";"Adventurers wanted! Apply here!"
"66848564-0-8699";"Dangerous work for hire!"
"66848564-0-8700";"The Three have need of you!"
"66848564-0-8701";"The Tribunal pays well!"
"66848564-0-8702";"Dangerous work for hire!"
"66848564-0-8703";"The Three have need of you!"
"66848564-0-8704";"The Tribunal pays well!"
"66848564-0-8720";"If you're willing to work, I'm ready to hire."
"66848564-0-8721";"If you're willing to work, I'm ready to hire."
"66848564-0-8722";"If you're willing to work, I'm ready to hire."
"66848564-0-8729";"Perfect! A witness to our achievement. You there, come see!"
"66848564-0-8732";"I can't believe I'm dealing with this problem. You, your fate walks these halls. Come here."
"66848564-0-8737";"More maligraphies? Can't Tho'at Replicanum take a break?"
