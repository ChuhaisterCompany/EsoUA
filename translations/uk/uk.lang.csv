The passenger's Riding Speed does not contribute to the Multi-Rider Mount's speed.\n\nDrivers and passengers on a Multi-Rider Mount are targeted by enemies individually, taking individual damage and losing individual Riding Stamina. Drivers knocked off their mounts or killed while mounted also cause passengers to dismount, whereas passengers knocked off the mount or killed do not disrupt the driver."
