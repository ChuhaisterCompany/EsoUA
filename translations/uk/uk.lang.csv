"165399380-0-14";"Not now, friend. Please, not now.\n\nWe have so much work to do, and I'm not sure how we'll get it all done."
"165399380-0-208";"The Magis Order write their own laws and must not be trusted - be mindful in your dealings with them."
"165399380-0-304";"Hallo there."
"165399380-0-382";"I'm not leaving. Not without her."
"165399380-0-612";"<I am conditionally invisible.>"
"165399380-0-646";"Man, I hate Bob!"
"165399380-0-901";"Incompetents! Idiots! How could they allow this to happen? Thank the Eight for the Lion Guard."
"165399380-0-906";"Here I am, safe and sound back in Aldcroft. \n\nI have you to thank for that."
"165399380-0-1560";"You! You're not a mudcrab, are you? \n\nAre you one of those damned poachers wandering about and stealing my shells? \n\nYou seem a bit taller, but you won't fool me! I know you're up to no good."
"165399380-0-1652";"Behold the all powerful Important Mage."
"165399380-0-1859";"The Fighters Guild was good enough to let us set up shop in here. Since then, business has been wonderful!"
"165399380-0-1890";"Dark times are upon us, friend. My family struggles to survive, while our beloved nobles bicker ceaselessly about the most meaningless things.\n\nI tell you, just the thought of it makes my stomach want to heave."
"165399380-0-1908";"I am the proud leader of the Knights of the Flame, the sworn protectors of Alcaire.\n\nWe'll eliminate any threat to Duke Nathaniel, no matter what it takes."
"165399380-0-1929";"The tension is thick around here. I'm not used to Bretons and Redguards at odds. Aren't we supposed to be allies?"
"165399380-0-1939";"I'm sorry. We're not ready for business yet."
"165399380-0-2002";"Don't worry about the farm. It's just a place. We can build another one.\n\nWhat's important is that you saved me and my wife. As long as we're together, we can weather anything.\n\nThank you so much. May the Eight watch over you."
"165399380-0-2011";"Hoarfrost Downs used to be a grand little town. Now look at it! Nothing's been the same since Ranser's War."
"165399380-0-2046";"S'rashi welcomes you on behalf of The Even Hand. As a neutral organization, we deal in information, legal and otherwise. This one would be a useful friend.\n\nS'rashi has heard of your exploits. If you're looking for work, S'rashi could use a favor."
"165399380-0-2048";"No one gets in without an invitation. Don't have one, do you?"
"165399380-0-2050";"Move along, vagabond. Unless you've got an invitation?\n\nDidn't think so."
"165399380-0-2071";"The duchess died by my hand. My crime is unforgivable, and I accept full responsibility.\n\nDo what must be done."
"165399380-0-2077";"Yes, what is it? If you don't have business with the treasurer, I would suggest you be on your way."
"165399380-0-2089";"We must uphold the Daggerfall Covenant, no matter what the cost.\n\nWe must purge the unclean filth from all Covenant territories, starting with Stormhaven."
"165399380-0-2120";"Countess Tamrith returns here for her father's funeral, and what does House Montclair do? They attack the upper city!\n\nThe bastards killed more Shornhelm Guards and civilians than I care to think about. It's like Ranser's War all over again!"
"165399380-0-2194";"They come to Alcaire, not as friends, but as foes.\n\nThey camp at our doorstep. They claim diplomacy, but they lie.\n\nThe Covenant is a lie. Our dreams tell it true."
"165399380-0-2196";"She brought them here: Lakana the Faithless. Lakana the Sorceress!\n\nAlcaire suffers as long as she lives. I honored her once, but now she brings misery and death.\n\nNo! What am I saying? Yet these nightmares began with her. She caused this madness!"
"165399380-0-2224";"0"
"165399380-0-2243";"Sir Edmund sent for me, and I came as soon as I could. \n\nSir Hughes does not plead for clemency, yet he says his mind was not his own?"
"165399380-0-2308";"You know. It's actually ironic. I—probably the most unworthy man in all the kingdom—wound up being High King. It makes the entire Covenant look like some kind of circus. \n\nYes, it's better that someone else takes the throne. I accept my fate."
"165399380-0-2319";"I'm a Knight of the Flame. We're sworn to protect Alcaire."
"165399380-0-2365";"You have done much to displease my mistress, yet she is not without mercy.\n\nCome. Listen to my words."
"165399380-0-2473";"My wife ran into Montclair's forces on the road near the Hinault's farm. She managed to make it home, but she's been ill ever since. \n\nNothing seems to help. I just pray this isn't that blood-curse we've been hearing about."
"165399380-0-2502";"You can't travel the roads without fearing for your life. You can't tend your fields or herd your goats without a Nord trying to cut you down.\n\nWhen will Northpoint act?"
"165399380-0-2538";"I am going back to Hammerfell and I am going to build a forge just like this one.\n\nImagine how much business I can do. I could have three smiths working around the clock!"
"165399380-0-2556";"You look into the mirror seeking answers, but there are no answers here for you. \n\nI am here for the countess and the countess alone. You would be wise to be on your way."
"165399380-0-2559";"<Count Hosni doesn't respond.>"
"165399380-0-2560";"<Lady Adima offers no response.>"
"165399380-0-2574";"If only I was younger… faster. I can barely move. I've lived to be a toothless dog."
"165399380-0-2647";"War can be good for business, but not if I can't reach my market.\n\nI desperately want to make it to Shornhelm, but the guard refuses to let me through. They say it isn't safe!"
"165399380-0-2648";"Unless you're buying something from Lanbaar, I'd suggest you move along."
"165399380-0-2650";"Sorry. My skills are reserved for the Shornhelm guard. Even if I'm not busy, I have be ready in case they need me."
"165399380-0-2651";"Blessed Arkay, take these poor souls under your care."
"165399380-0-2665";"Fancy a bit of fishing? We old fools have been fishing here longer than any of us can remember.\n\nThen again, most of us can't remember what we had for breakfast this morning. Aye, it's a good life."
"165399380-0-2685";"It's like we're living inside a tale told around a campfire, and it's a dark tale, indeed!\n\nDriven from our home by vampires … forced to watch as friends and family become bloodfiends. And then there was that … that … abomination!"
"165399380-0-2697";"I can't sleep. I keep thinking about those fiends. What's to stop them from following us and finishing what they started in Crestshade?\n\nAnd to top it all off, I was forced to leave my beloved wife behind when we fled."
"165399380-0-2699";"Everyone wants something from the woodcarver today. Spears, tent poles, fire wood … how do they expect me to keep up this pace?"
"165399380-0-2774";"Spare some gold for a worker down on his luck?"
"165399380-0-2776";"Nothing can save us! They're coming for you, for me, for all of us!"
"165399380-0-2777";"Need something to ride? Most of my stock was killed, stolen, or commandeered by the guard, but the mounts I do have are healthy and strong."
"165399380-0-2778";"That's a fine how do you do! Do you make a habit of barging into a person's house?\n\nYou're lucky. If I weren't so exhausted, I'd knock you over the head with my broomstick."
"165399380-0-2779";"Who are you? Why are you here? You can't arrest me! I'm not breaking any laws!"
"165399380-0-2780";"With all the recent trouble, these streets aren't safe at night. You should be careful and keep a hand on your gold pouch."
"165399380-0-2781";"Come closer. My hearing isn't what it used to be. Are you a soldier? Not one of Montclair's, I hope. Those ruffians! They're cowards, the lot of them, to hit an old woman like me."
"165399380-0-2783";"Please don't disturb my mother. She needs her rest."
"165399380-0-2784";"Ranser may have been an idiot, and Montclair isn't any better, but Shornhelm could really use a king."
"165399380-0-2785";"What is it? Why can't you leave a poor man to his sorrows?"
"165399380-0-2786";"Dry as a bone. I think this well's been cursed!"
"165399380-0-2841";"You're fortunate to have found me, friend! I was just about to pack up and look for a better location."
"165399380-0-2884";"Just passing through, traveler? I'm about to head out myself. Between the bandits and the vampires and the rumors of war, I want to get out of Rivenspire as fast as I can."
"165399380-0-2887";"If that Captain Thayer comes around here again, someone's going to get hurt! That wench called me a coward because I prefer to work here rather than join the Shornhelm Guard. \n\nSense of duty? Pfft! That's a pile of guar-dung!"
"165399380-0-2888";"Just resting the legs for a few minutes here and letting my friends graze. No matter how bad things get, I'm always grateful that I have work that I love.\n\nIt's not everyone who finds their true calling."
"165399380-0-2945";"Something I can help you with today? Feel free to browse and just holler if you need help."
"165399380-0-2954";"At least the shipping lanes are open again. Montclair's foolishness has cost me more gold than I care to think about."
"165399380-0-2957";"My chickens are dying and I can't figure out why. I come out in the morning, and they're just dead. No blood or nothing. Doesn't make sense."
"165399380-0-2983";"Beautiful day, isn't it? The cackling of the chickens is music to my ears. And the crowing of the rooster makes such sweet poetry. They're almost in harmony."
"165399380-0-3090";"Haven't had a good night's rest since my neighbor got those chickens.\n\nThey sent him to Alcaire to drive us mad. I know they did!"
"165399380-0-3094";"Pardon my poor welcome, stranger. Ever since I took in those poor mages from the Guild, there's nothing left to eat in our house but the chairs and tables."
"165399380-0-3106";"If you're not here with food or firewood, I'm not getting out of bed."
"165399380-0-3107";"The shops charge too much, and I don't think they're entirely honest. \n\nAs soon as the roads are a bit safer, I'm going back to Wayrest."
"165399380-0-3109";"Remember the past."
"165399380-0-3111";"It's nothing personal, stranger. I just don't trust you.\n\nWe don't like strangers around here."
"165399380-0-3112";"Such beautiful flowers. Enjoy them while you can, wanderer."
"165399380-0-3113";"The history of this region is fascinating."
"165399380-0-3153";"If we hadn't already lost half the crew, I'd have half a mind to teach these village guards a lesson."
"165399380-0-3179";"Welcome to the Old Goat Inn.\n\nMind your manners, or the Redguards will kick you out."
"165399380-0-3536";"The mill had some room, so they allowed us to set up our alchemy stations in here. Now I have to make sure we haven't forgotten anything."
"165399380-0-3537";"Steel and stone! You just gonna gawk at that anvil or are you gonna do something with it?\n\nBah. If you're gonna linger you may as well buy something."
"165399380-0-3541";"Mauloch's jawbone … needled myself again! Got hands like an ogre, I do! You look nimble though. Need something?"
"165399380-0-3543";"Anything can be made better through enchantment. Anything. Don't believe me? Give it a try."
"165399380-0-3928";"I know I'm a long way from home, but I figure as long as I do my job, my life is nice and quiet.\n\nI do miss the forest, though."
"165399380-0-3929";"When you live in one of the largest cities in the kingdom, you can gather the best ingredients.\n\nOh, and being able to hire an assistant certainly helps!"
"165399380-0-3930";"Welcome to Wayrest, stranger! We have an abundance of shoppers and gawkers from all over Menevia.\n\nI really hope you move along to another city soon."
"165399380-0-3935";"Seems like the campaign against the ogres never ends!\n\nI heard they're still close to Wayrest."
"165399380-0-3956";"That's right. I have a Breton name. I sing Breton songs, and I craft Breton lutes and drums. I actually enjoy it more than bashing in Goblin heads with a jagged piece of metal.\n\nI'd rather sing about bashing in Goblin heads."
"165399380-0-4011";"Thanks, friend. But I'm not the cult's only prisoner."
"165399380-0-4017";"Watch yourself. This place is thick with Bloodthorn cultists."
"165399380-0-4061";"Welcome to the bank of Wayrest. You can trust our security and discretion."
"165399380-0-4062";"You don't leave town without proper equipment, do you? What can I get you?\n\nChoosing the right gear can be a matter of life and death!"
"165399380-0-4063";"Well hello there! I'm sorry it's a bit of a mess in here—we're doing some remodeling.\n\nI have a wide assortment of goods that might interest you. I might have to move some things around, but would you care to take a look?"
"165399380-0-4064";"Sure are a lot of people around here! It's a pity there aren't more mages.\n\nWhat can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-4065";"My father, Noah Georence, crafts the finest armor in Stormhaven.\n\nSo … are you here to admire his handiwork, or are you going to actually buy something? Let's make a deal."
"165399380-0-4066";"After years in the army, I can tell you nothing is better than some solid protection when you're in a fight."
"165399380-0-4096";"Many pursue the arcane arts, but few truly master them."
"165399380-0-4104";"Armor is for those who can't learn how to avoid being hit.\n\nI can teach you how to take down anyone in armor."
"165399380-0-4105";"Anyone can pick up a sword.\n\nLearning to wield it properly requires dedication and constant practice."
"165399380-0-4252";"i'm a test mob."
"165399380-0-4615";"So … cold. I can't imagine a worse fate than to be trapped here. Waiting … watching … feeling.\n\nThat's the worst. I can feel my flesh. It craves destruction. It craves blood."
"165399380-0-4861";"I'm dying, my love….\n\nGregoire, stay with me a little longer…."
"165399380-0-4911";"A friendly face in our little village? That's a good omen!\n\nDon't mind the others. Many are distraught over the loss of our horses. I know the Herd Mother will look after us, as she always has."
"165399380-0-4913";"The Dusklight is the finest inn in Hoarfrost Downs. It's also the only inn in Hoarfrost Downs! What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-4967";"I'm still not feeling well, but you have my thanks!"
"165399380-0-4969";"I want to offer my thanks before you leave! \n\nWithout your help, I would have been dinner for those spiders."
"165399380-0-4970";"Truly, I cannot thank you enough. You've saved my life."
"165399380-0-4982";"Stranger, I'm bold to ask, but have you met a man named <<1>> in the neighborhood?"
"165399380-0-4983";"<This man appears to have been enchanted by the spellbook.>"
"165399380-0-4984";"What can I do for you, stranger?"
"165399380-0-5074";"Good weather for fishing, don't you think? And look at those clouds! You know the old saying: Clouds like mammoths, cast your lines. Clouds like Dragons, run and hide."
"165399380-0-5151";"I'm not sure what I'm doing on top of this hill.\n\nThe weather is quite pleasant, so I suppose it can't be all bad.\n\nMy name? Well, I can't quite recall it! I'm sure it doesn't really matter."
"165399380-0-5245";"There may be vampires and other evils in the world, but we still have fish in the water and crabs on the sand.\n\nI'm not giving up."
"165399380-0-5254";"Welcome to the Wayside Inn. \n\nWhether it's cold beer or fine wine you prefer, we have it all."
"165399380-0-5270";"She meant the world to me, but now, we'll never see each other again.\n\nAt least we won't have other murders like this one. Thank you."
"165399380-0-5273";"No matter what's going on in the rest of Rivenspire, we still have a job to do out here. And that's just what we're going to do!"
"165399380-0-5283";"Now that Northpoint is open again, maybe things around here will get back to normal.\n\nI just wish I knew what was eating all the vegetables in my garden."
"165399380-0-5299";"This one begs your pardon, but Mister Munier tells me when he is expecting guests.\n\nIf you would kindly leave the premises, this would be most appreciated."
"165399380-0-5300";"Amidst the chaos, I have found respite. \n\nAny who come seeking knowledge and reflection are welcome by my campfire."
"165399380-0-5302";"Friend, you have found me again. I cannot fully express my thanks with clumsy words.\n\nI know your path is not an easy one. I will pray each step you take will be surefooted."
"165399380-0-5308";"Fishing without my Annine is not the same.\n\nLife without her will never be the same. I go day to day now."
"165399380-0-5322";"I've been too busy healing the wounded and dying. I haven't had time to help on the battlefield."
"165399380-0-5328";"Arkay sent you! Gods bless you.\n\nPlease, please help! It's Marcel."
"165399380-0-5329";"Oh, a tasty one!\n\nLean down. I'll only chew your face a bit."
"165399380-0-5391";"Always digging. It seems like there are always so many dead people. \n\nCouldn't someone at the mage's guild create some kind of magic shovel? I've seen magic brooms."
"165399380-0-5417";"We must purify the Daggerfall Covenant, no matter what the cost … even if that means hiring mercenaries to do the work."
"165399380-0-5424";"What am I going to do? What am I going to do?"
"165399380-0-5450";"How does that song go? Have you heard it? It's called ""The Orc and the Bear.""\n\nI can't sing it until I remember it properly. Maybe it's called ""The Bear and the Orc."" Is that it?"
"165399380-0-5504";"Clan Murtag defends the Daggerfall Covenant to the death. The honor of all Orcs, Bretons, and Redguards is at stake.\n\nSo says <<1>>, our illustrious leader."
"165399380-0-5575";"Greetings, traveler."
"165399380-0-5586";"I am bound to your will."
"165399380-0-5615";"My children and my people suffer.\n\nThe Planemeld continues … but that's not why I'm restless."
"165399380-0-5628";"Do not interrupt our conversation. We're discussing some important business. The Blackmauls have a lucrative relationship with Clan Murtag."
"165399380-0-5634";"Wherever the guards go, profit is sure to follow. I have an ample supply, if there's anything you happen to need."
"165399380-0-5648";"If Murlog keeps drinking like this, I'm going back to Orsinium. \n\nMy mother warned me about marrying a soldier."
"165399380-0-5653";"You were in my dream. You … saved me.\n\nMalacath curse me, what have I done? What have I done?"
"165399380-0-5654";"Clan Murtag will defend the Daggerfall Covenant to the death!\n\nI see now that we were being influenced, but that's no excuse for our behavior. We'll help make things right in Stormhaven."
"165399380-0-5656";"Clan Murtag no longer requires our services.\n\nWe'll be on our way soon, but I have no doubt our paths will cross again."
"165399380-0-5662";"This nightmare is neverending. All my choices have ended in death and destruction. The Daedra are everywhere now, poisoning my mind with their lies.\n\nYou must save the Daggerfall Covenant. Kill the Omen of Counting Stars!"
"165399380-0-5694";"He's not coming out, is he?\n\nIs he?"
"165399380-0-5837";"I can breathe again. Thank the Eight, I can breathe!"
"165399380-0-5873";"I'm glad you stopped by. I didn't take the time to thank you properly before. \n\nSo thank you. Properly."
"165399380-0-5880";"Why's it called blue wine? It's not actually blue."
"165399380-0-5894";"They took my husband. He was only trying to defend our homes, but the dreugh took him. \n\nPlease, stranger, can you help?"
"165399380-0-5995";"What's this? Another guttersnipe here to whine about the dreugh?"
"165399380-0-6016";"Friend or foe? Declare yourself! \n\nNo one will harm the Abbot, not while I draw breath."
"165399380-0-6017";"<You've found Abbot Durak's unconscious body.>"
"165399380-0-6021";"Abbot Durak led us here for something he called ""Azura's Guardian."" He said it could stop the fires and protect the abbey.\n\nThe two of us were told to wait here outside. Then we got ambushed."
"165399380-0-6028";"An atronach! Simply amazing. \n\nDurak, you were right, my friend. You were right."
"165399380-0-6053";"I have a great deal on my mind right now. Perhaps we could talk another time."
"165399380-0-6055";"This sister has suffered a concussion, and the brother behind me has internal injuries. \n\nIt's an outrage. The Union must be stopped."
"165399380-0-6062";"The fields! The fields are burning!"
"165399380-0-6063";"I don't understand how this could be happening … we have no feud with the Midnight Union!\n\nWhy would they suddenly come here and destroy the Abbey? It doesn't make any sense."
"165399380-0-6072";"The Midnight Union, pfah! And Sister Safia said we could trust them."
"165399380-0-6073";"Azura take them! I planted that cornfield myself."
"165399380-0-6076";"<You've found Abbot Durak's unconscious body.>"
"165399380-0-6089";"Without you, I'd still be trapped in that dream.\n\nNow we must work together to stop this threat to High Rock."
"165399380-0-6093";"You're the one who helped save our fields.\n\nListen—I may have discovered the source of Durak's affliction."
"165399380-0-6094";"The greater part of our task still lies ahead."
"165399380-0-6096";"Did you find the key?"
"165399380-0-6188";"You! You look pretty dangerous. You're drafted. \n\nThere are Goblins here that need killing."
"165399380-0-6189";"I did all that I could but there was just too many of them to fight off."
"165399380-0-6194";"What a glorious day!"
"165399380-0-6225";"Well, at least now we know what brought the Stonechewer Goblins down on us."
"165399380-0-6321";"Life is tedious, but bloodshed relieves the ennui. Don't you think?"
"165399380-0-6332";"If you're heading for Cumberland's Watch, I've bad news. Goblins have overrun the fort."
"165399380-0-6354";"I'm glad to see you again!"
"165399380-0-6355";"You saved my life <<1>>."
"165399380-0-6359";"Please. You have to help me. \n\nThe Midnight Union bandits. I don't know why. I was no threat to them. They attacked me anyways."
"165399380-0-6418";"Look—I have no interest in risking my money on this hand-held ballista contraption. Who would want a bow they have to load and fire with a trigger?\n\nI don't have any gold anyhow … oh … I'm sorry. Thought you were someone else."
"165399380-0-6448";"It was a trap. They knew we were coming!"
"165399380-0-6456";"If you want me to play something for you, you'll just have to wait your turn."
"165399380-0-6505";"We were hunting for a tome called the Book of Circles when we fell prey to an ambush."
"165399380-0-6515";"We can't leave until we've rescued the people these Supernal Dreamers captured."
"165399380-0-6551";"I know you—you're the meddler from Pariah Abbey.\n\nI don't care, so long as you amuse us more than the other guests. Quite frankly, they're gutless and feeble."
"165399380-0-6624";"Oh, praise the Eight you're not a slaver! Feels like I've been hiding up here forever.\n\nYou've got to help me. They put out the signal fire and I need help getting it relit."
"165399380-0-6708";"What business do you have with me?"
"165399380-0-6711";"What is it that you seek?"
"165399380-0-6739";"The guards watch me like a hawk whenever I'm preparing their food.\n\nThe slavers think their wine is safe because they're keeping an eye on it. We should prove they're wrong.\n\nA little poison should do the trick, don't you think?"
"165399380-0-6821";"I barely escaped with my life! Please, you've got to listen to me!\n\nI came here at the behest of the patriarch. I thought it was an honor to be summoned by him. \n\nI was wrong. He's gone completely mad!"
"165399380-0-6842";"Never a dull day in Alcaire. These are thirsty times, my friend."
"165399380-0-6848";"I was beginning to get worried!\n\nI overheard the Supernal Dreamers talking about using me in some sort of ritual. I guess you got here just in time."
"165399380-0-6862";"Do you mind? I prefer to drink in peace."
"165399380-0-6900";"I was enslaved in a Dunmer mine years ago, but I escaped. Now, of all the villages in all of Tamriel, they attack here? \n\nI think maybe I'm cursed. I'm not going anywhere until I'm sure the slavers are long gone."
"165399380-0-6975";"What do you want? Do you make it a habit to accost strangers? \n\nThat's foolish, even in the best of times."
"165399380-0-6978";"Be on about your business."
"165399380-0-6979";"I have to admit, the man knows how to brew a good beer!"
"165399380-0-6980";"Would you look at this? It's just my luck."
"165399380-0-7044";"Being a dockworker has its benefits … the ocean breeze on my face, eating fresh fish for lunch and meeting new people every day.\n\nOn the downside, it stinks like rotten fish and I've gotten more splinters than I can count."
"165399380-0-7084";"I killed her. She deserved it, didn't she?  \n\nI know she did, or I think I know … is this real?"
"165399380-0-7085";"You killed the Omen. May the Eight bless you.\n\nMy mind is free … but my sins remain."
"165399380-0-7182";"These devices would be quite fascinating… if they weren't trying to kill us."
"165399380-0-7196";"Welcome to my realm.\n\nBe at ease and listen to my songs."
"165399380-0-7244";"There were vibrations everywhere. \n\nThere were sounds beyond hearing, just a ringing in the ears. \n\nI think I was close to understanding something."
"165399380-0-7248";"I'm fairly sure one of those runes represented a rather nuanced concept. It symbolizes a lost soul vainly straining to reach apotheosis.\n\nDid I mention that?"
"165399380-0-7252";"Did you hear me?"
"165399380-0-7291";"I don't know what's going on around here, but if you're looking for a good Orcish novel, I can offer a few suggestions."
"165399380-0-7302";"<This knight is too injured to speak.>"
"165399380-0-7303";"So many brave and injured knights. Some will not live to see tomorrow."
"165399380-0-7309";"Whatever dark influence that dominated Sir Hughes, that was the enemy.\n\nThis man is innocent."
"165399380-0-7395";"What assistance do you require, traveler? \n\nIf you're looking for advice, I suggest you remain in Stormhaven … and stay well away from Rivenspire."
"165399380-0-7778";"Welcome to Evermore, stranger.\n\nI fear our court is not suited for visitors at this time, but you are welcome to enjoy any of the services within our city."
"165399380-0-7806";"Welcome to the Anchor's Point—a cozy home in weather fair or foul! How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-7812";"Are you interested in the arcane arts? \n\nMagic is an art, you know."
"165399380-0-7960";"Why hellooooo!"
"165399380-0-8114";"Why hellooooo!"
"165399380-0-8120";"Lorelia sent you, didn't she? She always takes such good care of me."
"165399380-0-8121";"What's going on here? Who are all you people? Who am I?"
"165399380-0-8241";"Blessings of the Eight upon you."
"165399380-0-8245";"Kynareth's good fortune upon you, friend."
"165399380-0-9140";"The streets of <<1>> run red with the blood of Imperial dogs.\n\nThe town is ours again!"
"165399380-0-9226";"We built this bank to last. We built it like a fortress."
"165399380-0-9227";"I can offer you some of the finest swords you've ever seen."
"165399380-0-9228";"Some days, it seems there are more boats coming and going than drops of water in the sea."
"165399380-0-9232";"I'm here to see S'rashi. My business is my own."
"165399380-0-9234";"The forge keeps me  busy, but I've always got time for aspiring blacksmiths.\n\nNeed anything?"
"165399380-0-9235";"War's coming, friend. That's bad news for soldiers, but it's plenty of business for crafters like us who make weapons and armor."
"165399380-0-9236";"Interested in buying? I can offer you a great deal."
"165399380-0-9237";"In this, our chironasium, the enchanters and alchemists of Wayrest share their resources.\n\nAnd you benefit from our collaboration!"
"165399380-0-9241";"Orcs and Redguards aren't subtle, but in battle, they're unmatched. We couldn't ask for better allies."
"165399380-0-9242";"Redguard steel has protected Wayrest for many generations, just as it does today."
"165399380-0-9243";"If you expect me to teleport you someplace, just go away. I'm out of that business."
"165399380-0-9313";"They got him! I killed the Scamps, but they got Master Muzgu."
"165399380-0-9314";"Friend, have you considered that your soul has a real value?"
"165399380-0-9320";"You're not a Supernal Dreamer. Who are you?"
"165399380-0-9321";"There's a good reason these people are down here. It's a matter of simple mathematics."
"165399380-0-9323";"<Master Muzgu has died from poison.>"
"165399380-0-9328";"What's … where am I? Oh, gods, let me go!"
"165399380-0-9374";"I have nothing to say to you. Begone!"
"165399380-0-9375";"Excuse us, this is a private matter."
"165399380-0-9479";"The blasted dreugh are everywhere, and these citizens are brave, but they're no soldiers.\n\nCan you help, stranger? It's desperate."
"165399380-0-9499";"The Daggerfall Covenant means nothing to me. It's political jousting, as far as I'm concerned. \n\nSo long as no one takes away my ale, the king can ally with whoever he wants."
"165399380-0-9974";"Tava's blessings be upon you, wayfarer. You have come for silks and fine wools, yes? Our robes and tunics will ward off the desert heat and your foe's blade in equal measure."
"165399380-0-9975";"The desert is an unforgiving place, wayfarer. Are you sure you are prepared? \n\nTake a look at my goods. You may find something needful."
"165399380-0-9976";"In defense, speed is best. Is it not so? In this armor, you will be swift as a scorpion."
"165399380-0-10040";"Welcome to the Desert Star—Sentinel's most aromatic blossom of culture and refinement. Please, sit and be welcome."
"165399380-0-10044";"Greetings to the Sisters of the Sands. Sit, and abide a while. Our inn is your oasis in the desert."
"165399380-0-10045";"Take your time and browse, my friend! \n\nI'm sure you'll find I have what you've always wanted."
"165399380-0-10046";"My countrymen prefer the simple elegance of the sword—but there is glory to be found in the bow and staff as well. If you have an eye for fine woodcraft, you'll want to see my stock."
"165399380-0-10048";"Hail, O wayfarer. The swords of Alik'r are the finest in all of Tamriel. But mind your fingers! They are as sharp as jackal fangs."
"165399380-0-10061";"Welcome, wayfarer. You have traveled far, is it not so? You may sit and take rest in our hall, but do not tarry long. I have training to offer."
"165399380-0-10101";"Welcome to Samaruik, palace of the all-beneficent King Fahara'jad. I serve His Majesty, and through him I serve our people. \n\nWhat seek you here?"
"165399380-0-10115";"I thought it would be so glamorous to be married to the king's favored general. \n\nI was wrong though. It is not glamorous; it is just lonely."
"165399380-0-10228";"Welcome to Neeneban's Emporium of strange and wonderful things!\n\nCan I interest you in a lizard-catching net … or perhaps a trained lizard?"
"165399380-0-10229";"Another joins us!"
"165399380-0-10230";"I've never enjoyed such fine food and drink!  I don't want to stop!  Why would I?"
"165399380-0-10231";"What?  Oh… welcome to the party!"
"165399380-0-10232";"I've never knew such joy existed.  Nothing else seems important!"
"165399380-0-10268";"There you are! Say, about that drink … I'm afraid I spent my last gold on this one.\n\nMaybe next time!"
"165399380-0-10433";"Thanks for that, but you should have stayed back. That man … he's stir crazy. He's been harassing people for days trying to cause trouble. I just happened to get caught in his sights this time.\n\nWatch your back out there, all right?"
"165399380-0-10533";"I was wealthy a month ago. And then the spiders came. Who knows what brought them, but it didn't stop our production.\n\nNow the spiders are everywhere! I've closed the mines, but the last prospectors haven't come out."
"165399380-0-10579";"Mauloch's sword! I thought I'd met my end! \n\nGet me out of here. We don't have much time!"
"165399380-0-10682";"One cannot simply swing a blade and expect success. Each novice here must forge a blade before learning to wield it.\n\nBy understanding what goes into making the blade, a novice can understand how it must be used."
"165399380-0-10713";"It's my job to keep the beetles in check, but something has gotten them riled up. I'm a farmer, not a warrior. I don't have the weapons or skills to deal with this."
"165399380-0-10749";"<<1>> thinks he's got worries? I brought most of the miners here. Now I have their deaths on my conscience."
"165399380-0-10755";"Welcome, O wayfarer."
"165399380-0-10946";"Running the mines is Kasal's job. I'm just his assistant.\n\nIf you want something, talk to him."
"165399380-0-11086";"I don't like your face, outsider."
"165399380-0-11118";"First sandstorms plague us. Then there's talk of necromancy.\n\nAnd now the Crowns won't leave us in peace!"
"165399380-0-11119";"People are disappearing from the streets, and no one's doing anything!\n\nAll the Crowns care about is keeping their people in power."
"165399380-0-11161";"No one knows what you need better than I do.\n\nYou won't find better deals!"
"165399380-0-11162";"So very busy, but not enough business!\n\nYou'd think with all the danger in this world, more people would want to wear light, inexpensive armor. I know you want some? Right? I smell a sale."
"165399380-0-11174";"No one gets through this door without my permission."
"165399380-0-11315";"You're heading the wrong way, wayfarer. Just so you know."
"165399380-0-11447";"Your pardon, citizen, but I do not have time to speak with you."
"165399380-0-11528";"I wish someone would bring me news of a dead Goblin shaman."
"165399380-0-11578";"Move along. We're waiting to see S'rashi, not you."
"165399380-0-11580";"Praise Azura! We're desperate. I beg you. The Abbey's under attack! They're trying to burn the place down!"
"165399380-0-11608";"If you haven't found out yet where they're holding Miranda, please keep searching. \n\nI'm working up my courage to go confront the kidnappers."
"165399380-0-11609";"Name of Azura!\n\nThis is bad."
"165399380-0-11610";"The Midnight Union has taken over Farangel's Landing.\n\nThey're holding my wife for ransom, but I can't pay it!"
"165399380-0-11614";"You're back. And alive."
"165399380-0-11636";"The Midnight Union? Cowards and traitors. Snuck up on us and attacked, and a few got by into the cave."
"165399380-0-11726";"I'm Lady Miranda's steward. \n\nWho are you, and what do you want here?"
"165399380-0-11729";"Whoever you are, please help me."
"165399380-0-11730";"<Miranda didn't quite make it.>"
"165399380-0-11788";"I don't believe I've ever seen you at any of Hosni's parties.\n\nI'm sorry this one had to be your first."
"165399380-0-11789";"Don't make eye contact with Lady Adima. \n\nIf she thinks you don't like her, she has the guards take you away."
"165399380-0-11790";"A new face? Welcome, stranger!\n\nIsn't this the most wonderful party? Wonderful, wonderful!"
"165399380-0-11815";"We're the Midnight Union! The Supernals should fear us.\n\nInstead, they've turned our shore into their campground. The dogs."
"165399380-0-11833";"Get lost."
"165399380-0-11841";"Leave me alone.\n\nI have more pressing matters at hand."
"165399380-0-11862";"Count Hosni is not present.\n\nAll closed up here, so move along."
"165399380-0-11915";"There's nothing better than a night of drinking … except a day of even more drinking."
"165399380-0-11916";"My wife, Franara, wanted to move out to the country. So here we are, I guess."
"165399380-0-11917";"I don't miss Koeglin Village one bit."
"165399380-0-11968";"The nobles tear at the scraps like rabid dogs. There's nothing left for me here.\n\nI almost wish Montclair would descend upon us and finish the lot of us off."
"165399380-0-12011";"Did my son send you, or are you just one of his feckless, doomed guests?"
"165399380-0-12012";"Keep out, you Supernal brutes! Remember what happened the last time you tried to sneak in?\n\nI may be old, but my stiletto is still sharp."
"165399380-0-12034";"<Count Hosni sleeps deeply, but looks troubled.>"
"165399380-0-12036";"My betrothed lies dead before me, but all I can feel is … relief."
"165399380-0-12038";"Hail, stranger! Welcome to Daggerfall."
"165399380-0-12053";"I need things."
"165399380-0-12058";"I'm a test NPC."
"165399380-0-12066";"Yeah? What?"
"165399380-0-12067";"Move along, you."
"165399380-0-12069";"Lady Adima—she was the Omen of Blood all along. A spirit. Not real …."
"165399380-0-12129";"Hail, stranger! Welcome to Daggerfall."
"165399380-0-12131";"Welcome to the Dusklight. I'm the cook.\n\nThings have been so nerve-wracking lately that I've started to lose my hair. If you find a stray strand or two, it's probably mine. But I wash it quite often, so don't let it concern you."
"165399380-0-12133";"Eggs are such delicate, precious things. Such a thin shell!"
"165399380-0-12134";"A fine weapon is an important accessory in times such as these. Feel free to examine my stock."
"165399380-0-12137";"You'll want to talk to my husband. He handles the customers, I just keep the fire going."
"165399380-0-12141";"If you're looking to protect yourself, I've got just what you need."
"165399380-0-12142";"Four pigs. Four chickens. Nice, even numbers.\n\nEven numbers are good. Not like odd numbers.\n\nWouldn't you agree?"
"165399380-0-12175";"Your Majesty. I humbly beg your forgiveness. My mind was poisoned, and I was not myself.\n\nI vow to make this up to you."
"165399380-0-12178";"It's a beauty, isn't it? Been working on this sword for months. \n\nI think I might send it to King Emeric as a gift."
"165399380-0-12186";"<The body in the water appears to be a Supernal Dreamer. It seems someone was using this dock as a dropoff to supply weapons to the Supernal Dreamers.>"
"165399380-0-12227";"You will pay for your interference, dog! My master will avenge me."
"165399380-0-12258";"I'm just checking the lock to make sure it's still safe. You can never be too sure.\n\nDid you lock your door? I think it's time for you to check it. If it's not locked, you aren't safe."
"165399380-0-12920";"You're not here for food, are you? Our rations are running out."
"165399380-0-12975";"All I hear outside is Montclair this and Montclair that! The Baron has been a true friend to the people of Rivenspire, and I'm sure he has a perfectly good reason for raising arms against the other nobles."
"165399380-0-12976";"My aunt has an opinion about everything. She's especially passionate about politics.\n\nBut she makes a mighty fine pie, though. So I sit here and listen, letting the wonderful aromas coming from her cooking fire fill me with happy thoughts."
"165399380-0-12980";"Hungry? I've got the freshest goods this side of the Darguard Ridge. That's not saying much, but you get the idea."
"165399380-0-13001";"O intrepid traveler! Heed my words before you climb this hill."
"165399380-0-13012";"No one's been in here since the Daedra appeared. Will you help me, stranger? Will you help this restless spirit find peace?"
"165399380-0-13013";"No entry. Duke's orders."
"165399380-0-13030";"It's good to be free at last. Thank you, Empty One."
"165399380-0-13041";"Sweet release! I am unbound!\n\nThank you, stranger. You have my eternal gratitude."
"165399380-0-13095";"After all the gold I've spent here, you'd think these backwater merchants would be more grateful. No patience whatsoever. I miss city life. I miss Wayrest.\n\nBy the way, have you seen Sir Higgens?"
"165399380-0-13117";"Sometimes, a true knight must undertake a mission that requires reading books rather than slaying monsters. Such is what I asked of you. \n\nDid you learn anything in the library?"
"165399380-0-13121";"The forge is closed, especially to strangers.\n\nThe door is over there."
"165399380-0-13124";"Welcome to the Sleepy Sailor. As long as you behave yourself, you're welcome to drink yourself into a stupor."
"165399380-0-13125";"<This man looks like he put up quite a fight before the slavers killed him. He's gripping a letter in his lifeless hand.>"
"165399380-0-13126";"Darima told me you spoke to Sir Hughes about Dame Falhut. Thank you.\n\nYou don't know what a relief it is to have her here. I am an outsider in Alcaire Castle, with no one I can fully trust. Sometimes, I even wonder if I can trust the duke."
"165399380-0-13134";"Have you seen my son? He's been missing four days now.\n\nThere are bad people everywhere right now. Even people in Koeglin can't be trusted."
"165399380-0-13135";"Shh! Just keep moving. I'm spying on the slavers."
"165399380-0-13138";"Who are you? What do you want?\n\nI don't like strangers in my home … especially in times like these!"
"165399380-0-13156";"I have no business with you. Come back when you're proven yourself."
"165399380-0-13166";"We could hear your fight from here, <<1>>.\n\nI take it Dame Falhut is dead. What happened?"
"165399380-0-13170";"<This body is still warm to the touch. The blade in its back bears the sigil of the Knights of the Flame. This weapon obviously belonged to Sir Hughes.>"
"165399380-0-13171";"Why would someone do this? Where were the Knights of the Flame? Why weren't they protecting my wife?\n\nThere must be something … anything … that will explain this. Search the castle!"
"165399380-0-13190";"Good morrow to you, fair person! Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is <<1>>, wandering knight and hero extraordinaire.\n\nCan I just say what a pleasure it is to have a bit of genial company once again? Praise the Eight!"
"165399380-0-13200";"Survivors of the Hinault Farm massacre have been wandering in, but there are still more of our soldiers out there.\n\nLieutenant Fairfax and his unit have yet to return. I hope they found a defensible position to hold up in."
"165399380-0-13203";"Help me! You've got to help me!"
"165399380-0-13204";"When the slavers show up for another attack, they'll be in for a nasty surprise."
"165399380-0-13209";"This ship is nothing but trouble."
"165399380-0-13211";"This ship is nothing but trouble."
"165399380-0-13215";"The constable has lost his mind."
"165399380-0-13222";"You walk among the living, yet you speak to the dead. I've heard only the winds of these caves for so long.\n\nCould you be here to help?"
"165399380-0-13231";"Honor and faith. These hold the Covenant together. Keep them always in your heart, warrior."
"165399380-0-13232";"Too busy, soldier. See Jeggord or Dar-Liurz."
"165399380-0-13233";"This is a bleak homecoming."
"165399380-0-13249";"Have you come to authorize release of our cargo? The Captain wants to talk to you. She's waiting in her cabin."
"165399380-0-13257";"Koeglin Village has been a lot more helpful since you proved our intent. Since we've already had a run-in with the slavers, I've agreed to do what I can to help the village."
"165399380-0-13260";"You don't have any skooma to spare, do you? No? \n\nThat's all right. I've never tried it before. I was just … curious."
"165399380-0-13263";"Work hard. Do not stop for idle chatter."
"165399380-0-13264";"Always more work to do."
"165399380-0-13265";"Don't know why you're here, but I know you'll leave soon."
"165399380-0-13290";"Chatter, clatter goes their teeth. Slither, slather goes their tail.\n\nThey watch us through the cracks in things."
"165399380-0-13291";"Who are you? What business do you have in the warehouse?"
"165399380-0-13310";"Tell me you don't come bringing more bad tidings. I've already heard about the slavers on the shore and the cultists in the hills.\n\nI don't mean to be rude, but I have enough concerns. It's probably better if you speak to Sir Hughes."
"165399380-0-13318";"I hope you will forgive us for not offering a more friendly welcome. The affairs of the region weigh heavily on my husband's shoulders.\n\nThere are also concerns about security here in the castle. You really should speak with Sir Hughes."
"165399380-0-13319";"Welcome to Alcaire Castle, visitor.\n\nI apologize beforehand if I'm a little blunt this morning. The duke and I have had a recent … disagreement, and I'm still attempting to clear my mind of distractions."
"165399380-0-13324";"Step right up and see the spectacle. Don't know if she's innocent or guilty, but it's good for business.\n\nSee anything you like?"
"165399380-0-13349";"Those who seek wisdom and observe the law will find peace in Julianos."
"165399380-0-13350";"Always be open and true to love and the beauty it brings."
"165399380-0-13351";"Honor the spirits, both living and dead."
"165399380-0-13352";"May Zenithar grant you prosperity in all your honest ventures."
"165399380-0-13353";"May Mara grant you peace."
"165399380-0-13354";"May Stendarr grant you clarity in your most trying of times."
"165399380-0-13369";"I'm not afraid of dying. But I am afraid of vampires!"
"165399380-0-13420";"What can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-13476";"My armor is the best protection money can buy.\n\nIf this isn't enough for you, I suggest buying a castle instead."
"165399380-0-13491";"The trick to sturdy gear is tight stitching. As I always say: stitch the sleeve, not the arm!"
"165399380-0-13509";"I must thank you again for interceding on my behalf. Sir Hughes spoke with Dame Falhut, and I was promptly allowed entry.\n\nIf only we could convince them that we came in peace. If only it was that easy!"
"165399380-0-13514";"King Fahara'jad is furious over the death of his daughter. He demands an immediate execution for her murderer."
"165399380-0-13526";"This wouldn't happen in Wrothgar. And if it did, we'd just string the madman up … or burn him … or throw him off a cliff. Whatever was easiest."
"165399380-0-13539";"Stay back. This is no place for the uninitiated."
"165399380-0-13549";"I'm a Knight of the Flame. We're the protectors of Alcaire."
"165399380-0-13550";"I'm a Knight of the Flame. We're the protectors of Alcaire."
"165399380-0-13695";"Please help me! They've taken my husband. They'll kill him. I know they will!"
"165399380-0-13711";"You dare address me uninvited? Go away until you learn some manners, pup."
"165399380-0-13761";"Slavers attacking Koeglin Village? Doesn't make any sense."
"165399380-0-13762";"The way things are going around here, I'm thinking of picking up and moving the family to Wayrest."
"165399380-0-13799";"Looking for a fight? You've come to the right place.\n\nEspecially if you're not one of those weaklings who won't fight to the death."
"165399380-0-13803";"Lakana. My friend. This can't be happening. How can she be dead?"
"165399380-0-13831";"If you're in the market for a reliable mount, I have horses from the Covenant lands.\n\nSometimes, I can manage to get a bear from the mountains near Orsinium!"
"165399380-0-13845";"No one followed you here, did they? I don't want to move again."
"165399380-0-13859";"Didn't I see you talking to those traitors?"
"165399380-0-13860";"My sister's supposed to be coming in from High Rock, but I've been waiting here for hours. I hope nothing's happened."
"165399380-0-13861";"You should be careful who you talk to around here."
"165399380-0-13865";"Haven't seen your face before. Are you one of this new crowd, come for the death-battles?"
"165399380-0-13866";"I knew the days of the Daggerfall Covenant were numbered."
"165399380-0-13880";"It takes much more than simple fabric to make a tailored masterpiece. A true clothier needs what I provide."
"165399380-0-13884";"I love the mix and mingle of alchemical concoctions. That's why I got into the business!"
"165399380-0-13885";"Yes, I am Shornhelm's most prominent enchanter. If you have enchanting needs, I can probably fulfill them. Feel free to examine my stock."
"165399380-0-13897";"Please help me! They've taken my husband. They'll kill him! I know they will!"
"165399380-0-13922";"You! Did Sir Hughes send you to kill me?"
"165399380-0-13932";"Most of my provisions are needed for the soldiers. But I do have some things I can trade, if you've the coin."
"165399380-0-13938";"This camp is all that remains of my regiment."
"165399380-0-13954";"Welcome to the bank of Wayrest. In times of trouble, you should take comfort knowing that we'll keep your money safe."
"165399380-0-13965";"I have a war to direct, soldier. Speak with the others if you need orders."
"165399380-0-13967";"Every day my future becomes more and more bleak. My sister ran off to Cyrodiil so long ago, I can barely remember her … and my brother? He's dead set on being a bandit. A bandit! My own brother!"
"165399380-0-13983";"<The dog whines anxiously.>"
"165399380-0-13984";"<This Breton hasn't been dead very long. His body is still warm.>"
"165399380-0-13985";"Welcome, friend. You can't get better fruits or vegetables anywhere in Daggerfall. I guarantee it!"
"165399380-0-13986";"Flowers for sale!  A posy to gain a sweetheart's favor, perhaps?"
"165399380-0-13987";"Interested in a set of new clothes? Something in silk, perhaps? No one ever leaves my shop empty handed."
"165399380-0-13988";"Welcome to Daggerfall. Move along."
"165399380-0-13989";"I'm busy. Can't you see I'm drinking here?"
"165399380-0-13990";"Unless this is about cargo, I can't talk right now. I'm extremely busy."
"165399380-0-14011";"What are you doing here?"
"165399380-0-14023";"What're you doing back here? Come to give me some coin?"
"165399380-0-14052";"Couldn't stop him!"
"165399380-0-14054";"Leave me to my drink."
"165399380-0-14056";"Welcome to Daggerfall."
"165399380-0-14088";"I'm glad the guards showed up when they did! Those bandits would've killed me!"
"165399380-0-14090";"I'm a little busy. Red Rook bandits are holding hostages at a house down the lane."
"165399380-0-14091";"We almost had him. Catch him before he reaches the King!"
"165399380-0-14096";"The spirit of the Wyrd weeps, for something drives her children mad. \n\nI fear for the innocents in this village."
"165399380-0-14098";"A caution, my friend. If you're following this road, know that Deleyn's Mill is lost!"
"165399380-0-14101";"My executioner? You couldn't lift the axe, let alone deal with all the blood."
"165399380-0-14103";"Thanks again for your help with the Bloodthorn. It was careless of me to get captured. \n\nNow, shall we straighten out this gloomy town of Aldcroft?"
"165399380-0-14108";"<The pig devours a huge chunk of the strange, thorny vine.>"
"165399380-0-14109";"<The pig pauses eating long enough to look up at you with tender affection before going back to its meal.>"
"165399380-0-14110";"Thieves! Daggerfall is full of them! They steal anything that's not nailed down!\n\nThey even stole my livestock."
"165399380-0-14111";"Welcome to the Rosy Lion, friend. Have a seat and I'll pour you a mug of something strong."
"165399380-0-14114";"I've no time to answer questions. Whether the noble houses will be patient is the least of my worries.\n\nWe only have a brief opportunity, so we must attack. Our enemies grow stronger with each passing moment."
"165399380-0-14130";"Ha! Stupid monsters! Nothing gets past Mighty Marie! Best saw in all the land!\n\nAs long as she spins, the mill will be safe."
"165399380-0-14144";"Did you hear? Such terrible news from the Mill."
"165399380-0-14145";"My husband says we're safe in here. I hope he's right, but I think he gives this stupid saw blade too much credit."
"165399380-0-14147";"<This is the corpse of the man from upstairs at the inn. Apparently, his employers weren't happy with his loose talk.>"
"165399380-0-14153";"Right, so here's how we capture a werewolf. You fight the beast and keep it busy. Meanwhile I cast the spell that entraps it. \n\nJust do your part and leave the magic to me. I'm an expert."
"165399380-0-14162";"I'm tired of defending this backwater. There's work to be done in Camlorn and … oh, sorry. I thought you were one of my soldiers."
"165399380-0-14163";"Why does the forest attack us? It makes no sense."
"165399380-0-14165";"Soon there'll be nothing left in Deleyn's Mill worth saving. If not for Bernard's quick thinking and the arrival of the wyrd sisters, we would have all died back there!"
"165399380-0-14170";"Angof the Gravesinger has imprisoned us and we are cut off from the Wyrd. You must set the Guardians free."
"165399380-0-14180";"Who are you to nonchalantly walk through flames and forest? You smell of the city of stone.\n\nHave you come to cleave our forest? Rip up our soil? Haven't the spirits already been enraged enough by your kind?"
"165399380-0-14191";"Hurry! He's trapped in the south tower."
"165399380-0-14192";"You captured one. Good work. \n\nNow for the ritual."
"165399380-0-14194";"Could you help me? I'm next. I know I'm going to be next."
"165399380-0-14201";"There must be something in the air. I've never seen the watch so busy."
"165399380-0-14202";"<This beggar was savagely mauled. Deep slashes appear to have been made by large, sharp claws.>"
"165399380-0-14206";"It was huge! Went right into the river after it struck down poor Guillaume."
"165399380-0-14208";"<This man's spine was twisted several times before he died. The attacker must have been incredibly strong.>"
"165399380-0-14209";"Get out of here! It'll kill you, too!"
"165399380-0-14210";"All I saw was fur and fangs! It killed that one in the alley, too!"
"165399380-0-14211";"It seems like the poor were made to suffer. I wish I had been born into a family of wealth and means."
"165399380-0-14215";"We supply the Lion Guard with whatever arcane gear they may need.\n\nBut we don't have an exclusive arrangement, so if you need something, just ask."
"165399380-0-14216";"Trust me, you don't want to sound like a child's rattle when you're trying to sneak around. \n\nYou want my leathers—strong enough to turn a blade yet silent as a whisper."
"165399380-0-14217";"What a rousing speech! Makes you want to run out and join the Lion Guard!"
"165399380-0-14219";"You don't look like you belong on the docks, friend. It can get kind of rough down here."
"165399380-0-14238";"Welcome, friend. I don't care what you may have heard, but I sell nothing but the best light armor that your gold can buy."
"165399380-0-14246";"I'm telling you, what with werewolves and cultists on every corner, you can't trust an inferior weapon to do the job."
"165399380-0-14247";"You want it sharp? You want it strong? You want it pointy? Well, you've come to the right place!\n\nSwords and daggers. Two-handers and single-hand grips. I've got just what you need."
"165399380-0-14248";"If you want state of the art protection, then you want to encase yourself in heavy metal armor.\n\nNothing gets through my armor. Arrows, axes, blades, my armor laughs at it all. Laughs, I tell you!"
"165399380-0-14249";"Times are tough, but people have to eat, right? There's barely enough for the residents, what with the influx of refugees and all.\n\nStill, if you have the gold, you're welcome to purchase whatever I have left."
"165399380-0-14258";"I stock the finest tools and supplies for runecrafters."
"165399380-0-14260";"Forget those idiots selling their rusty swords and shaft rotted axes. Make your own."
"165399380-0-14271";"I apologize—to all of you. I thought I could fight this off. I was wrong."
"165399380-0-14286";"The Wards are restored and so are we. We can again maintain vigil over the living and the dead, and ensure that both adhere to the divine laws of Tu'whacca.\n\nYour role in this has not gone unnoticed, young one."
"165399380-0-14299";"Looks like we're in time. The Duke hasn't transformed yet, but he's very close. \n\nIf you're sure about this, you'd better act now."
"165399380-0-14303";"Don't hassle the dock workers. They have plenty of work to do and no time for chit-chat."
"165399380-0-14307";"If you've got a problem, you can wait, or you can talk to my associate.\n\nI suggest you wait … or leave."
"165399380-0-14308";"I should never have suggested fleeing to Aldcroft. Brilliant idea, LeBlanc. \n\nNow they're gone. All the women in our group. Kidnapped by cultists and dragged off into the fen."
"165399380-0-14311";"I'm no warrior. I'm a chandler. Candles don't make very good weapons, you know."
"165399380-0-14313";"Help! Free us before the hags come! \n\nWe were traded like so many beads and glass trinkets. How degrading!"
"165399380-0-14314";"Break the stone! Just hit it with your weapon and smash it to bits!\n\nQuickly, before that horrible hag returns."
"165399380-0-14315";"Please, please! You must set me free.\n\nSwing your weapon and break the stone!"
"165399380-0-14326";"By Stendarr, I thought we'd have this figured out by now. We're supposed to be the Daggers' gadgeteers, after all.\n\nI never knew harpies could be so tricky."
"165399380-0-14327";"Did Lord Diel send you? Well, there's nothing new to report, except that my brother is an idiot.\n\nArmel placed dozens of traps and he just realized something. Harpies don't walk! Now we're trying to figure out how to salvage the situation."
"165399380-0-14328";"You're going to help me find the rest of the Daggers? Hmm. I'm not sure you're Dagger material.\n\nYour hands look kind of soft and delicate. Like you've never beaten anything into submission with your own two fists before."
"165399380-0-14330";"I can't do this! I haven't found a single harpy egg, and all around me, enraged harpies are mauling people.\n\nI'm going back to camp before I'm next!"
"165399380-0-14332";"What are you doing back here?"
"165399380-0-14333";"Tu'whacca says this is good. He says all is as it should be, and you have done well ….\n\nI agree with Tu'whacca. I have enjoyed walking the sands with you."
"165399380-0-14334";"Balance is restored. The dead can rest. The living can thrive. And we can return to our vigil."
"165399380-0-14341";"Ah, another one. Here to work with the great Lord Diel, no doubt.\n\nI'm renowned throughout Glenumbra, you know."
"165399380-0-14345";"Don't worry, no one will get past us, not as long as we draw breath!"
"165399380-0-14347";"No matter how much I study, I still have more to learn."
"165399380-0-14348";"Arcane knowledge is secret knowledge, but my bargains are clear and forthright! Take a look at what I'm offering today."
"165399380-0-14349";"I think all this talk of war will affect trade. I must shore up my investments accordingly."
"165399380-0-14350";"Sorry. I was just thinking. I need to walk through the alleys, but I'm afraid of the back-alley murderer."
"165399380-0-14352";"My family has lived in this city for many generations. This statue depicts my great-great-great-grandfather, Ducal."
"165399380-0-14358";"The ghosts of the Alessian army still haunt this place. \n\nIt's been an age since the Battle of Glenumbra Moors raged here, yet the spirits linger."
"165399380-0-14359";"Can't you see I'm miserable? Leave me to my pain."
"165399380-0-14360";"When food is this good, life is great!"
"165399380-0-14362";"It might be unseemly for a woman of noble birth to be drawn to the forge, but I can't help myself.\n\nI find all the muscles and sweating to be … so interesting."
"165399380-0-14373";"Pay no attention to my little friend here. He has a weakness for tall tales. The taller, the better, I'm afraid. \n\nIt's all rubbish, of course."
"165399380-0-14376";"Bhagrun here claimed that the threat that Faolchu poses has been greatly exaggerated. \n\nPoor fool wouldn't know a moth from a mammoth."
"165399380-0-14389";"There's no problem a few mugs of ale can't fix. And this sweet roll is delicious!"
"165399380-0-14390";"Have you ever met a wyrd sister? I think it might be fun to run around in the forest with the nature witches. At least for a little while."
"165399380-0-14392";"I'm writing a letter to my family back in Hammerfell. I have so much to tell them about!"
"165399380-0-14397";"Pay no attention to my little friend here. He has a weakness for tall tales. The taller, the better, I'm afraid. \n\nIt's all rubbish, of course."
"165399380-0-14398";"Bhagrun here claimed that the threat Faolchu poses has been greatly exaggerated. \n\nPoor fool wouldn't know a moth from a mammoth."
"165399380-0-14399";"Is there something I can help you with?\n\nHis lordship keeps me very busy, you know."
"165399380-0-14402";"I'm cold, I'm hungry, and I don't have any gold to my name.\n\nBut at least I'm in Daggerfall."
"165399380-0-14403";"A tidy shop is a profitable shop, my mother always told me.\n\nIf you've got anything to trade, I'll give you a fair price."
"165399380-0-14405";"My horses are beauties! Look how they hold their heads up high.\n\nI treat my horses well, whether they belong to me or if they just happen to rent a stall in my stables."
"165399380-0-14406";"Someday, my husband's ship will return. Until then, I'll come here every day to watch the harbor."
"165399380-0-14407";"I won't complain. I've got too much work to do."
"165399380-0-14409";"No matter how bad things get, as long as I can keep the flowers growing, I have hope for the future."
"165399380-0-14410";"I can never decide. The market has so many choices."
"165399380-0-14411";"Let me sleep in peace."
"165399380-0-14413";"It seems like I'm always working."
"165399380-0-14415";"Keep an eye on your gold. I was robbed and now I'm sleeping in the street."
"165399380-0-14420";"I assume you have my eggs? I really want to … er … get on with my studies. Yes, that's what I told you. Studies, right?"
"165399380-0-14430";"You helped me before. I'm hoping you can help me with one more thing … revenge!\n\nAsk <<1>> why the harpies are in such a state and attacking everyone. He'll claim ignorance. That's a lie. Lord Diel is responsible for all this!"
"165399380-0-14435";"I can't believe we ever agreed to this. What were we thinking? Can we really be that stupid?"
"165399380-0-14447";"What a disaster. Why did we try to be heroes?"
"165399380-0-14460";"<This Orc hasn't been dead for very long.>"
"165399380-0-14461";"Eh? What do you want with this old Huntmaster?"
"165399380-0-14464";"My poor Poppa, what will I do without you? Why would they kill a defenseless old man?"
"165399380-0-14469";"You're on a fool's errand."
"165399380-0-14474";"Angof's corruption defeated us. But never again, thanks to you."
"165399380-0-14475";"The stench of Angof's magic endures. It fouls the air with its wretched odor."
"165399380-0-14476";"Angof's foul influence pollutes the rivers and streams. We must end this corruption now."
"165399380-0-14496";"I had a terrible dream. It was very … bloody."
"165399380-0-14497";"I felt so … furry. And mean. Why was I so mean?"
"165399380-0-14502";"You saved my husband. I can't thank you enough for that. \n\nI'm truly in your debt."
"165399380-0-14503";"I was so worried about Father! How brave you were to rush in there and save him."
"165399380-0-14509";"I'm sorry. I should have told you. I thought I could fight it off.\n\nI was wrong."
"165399380-0-14512";"I can't thank you enough. You have saved my husband and you're well on the way to becoming Camlorn's savior.\n\nWe are truly in your debt."
"165399380-0-14513";"I was so worried about Father. How brave and courageous you were to save him."
"165399380-0-14519";"<<1>> does not like this desert where the dead crawl out of the ground.\n\nThey buy nothing, scare her customers, and want to bite her tail. <<1>> dislikes all of these things!"
"165399380-0-14528";"He's in agony! Do something! Help him!"
"165399380-0-14529";"What's happening to Father? This is so horrible."
"165399380-0-14531";"I should never have suggested fleeing to Aldcroft. Brilliant idea, LeBlanc. \n\nGone. All the women in our group. Kidnapped by cultists and dragged off into the Fens."
"165399380-0-14532";"We're very lucky you came along. Thank you."
"165399380-0-14545";"I thought Poppa was nearby, but now—nothing. \n\nDo you have his pipe? I just want to hold on to him, just a little longer."
"165399380-0-14553";"That's it. I've had it. I'm done with this bog. It's like looking for a needle in a muddy haystack!"
"165399380-0-14560";"I'm wet, I'm muddy, and I'm totally miserable. This was the worst idea ever!"
"165399380-0-14561";"We should never have left Camlorn. This bog is worse than the werewolves."
"165399380-0-14580";"Stranger, a word. You look like the courageous type. I have an opportunity. \n\nYou're sober, aren't you? Good. Are you interested in taking on a contract?"
"165399380-0-14596";"Ah, someone has finally arrived. My father sent me to this godsforsaken beach to round up some layabouts. I think he hates me. \n\nInterested in taking on a contract?"
"165399380-0-14601";"I'm sorry. I need something new to keep me occupied, but I can't decide between the martial arts or the culinary arts.\n\nMayhem or marinades? Fencing or fricasee? Bloodshed or blood pudding? It's a tough choice."
"165399380-0-14619";"I remember this place. It all started here, on the day of the final battle. \n\nWe gave up everything to kill Faolchu. I'll be damned if I just let him come back to life and curse the world again."
"165399380-0-14628";"I miss Orsinium something awful. I'm going to go back there one of these days. Take a ride on one of those ships and sail back home.\n\nOne of these days."
"165399380-0-14634";"Why do you linger while Parmion rallies the troops for the final assault? You're his best officer and our noblest knight."
"165399380-0-14635";"It's been so long since I've seen Leon. It's good just to spend some time with him.\n\nThank you for all you've done for us."
"165399380-0-14636";"I can feel the anger of the wraiths emanating from my sword. You've made the town safe for the living, but damned the innocents of Westtry.\n\nBut Leon is to blame for this, not you. I can't bear to speak to him yet. You tell him of his fate."
"165399380-0-14637";"The lamentations of Westtry's dead have been silenced. Now I can finally tell Rosalind how sorry I am.\n\nThank you, traveler."
"165399380-0-14638";"It's good to have Rosalind back, but she won't speak to me. What happened out there?"
"165399380-0-14639";"There you are, my knight. Did you recover the orders?"
"165399380-0-14640";"Quiet. I have a long-winded speech to give."
"165399380-0-14648";"There were too many of them. They tore us apart …. \n\nCaptain, I have bad news. Commander Parmion is dead."
"165399380-0-14649";"Do you need my assistance, sir?"
"165399380-0-14651";"What a disaster! I should have suspected a trap. And now Commander Parmion's dead. \n\nWhat about Faolchu?"
"165399380-0-14657";"Come, step forward. Let me get the measure of you, friend. It allows me to serve you better. Plus, I like to get to know as many of our members as I can."
"165399380-0-14660";"We can't resist much longer. Soon we'll be forced to answer their call."
"165399380-0-14661";"Welcome back. Are you all right? Were you successful? \n\nWhy … why are you staring at me like that?"
"165399380-0-14662";"It's good to have you back. \n\nSaravith was just starting to babble about time travel magic. But here you are, gender unchanged. As usual, her theories prove to be wildly inaccurate."
"165399380-0-14664";"You're back. And just in time. But the celebration must wait, I'm afraid.\n\nFaolchu's forces have taken all of Camlorn and the Lion Guard's counterattack falters."
"165399380-0-14671";"I was too weak to protect the tomb of my lord, the Iron Son of High Rock."
"165399380-0-14672";"I failed to protect the regalia of my exalted lord, the Golden Prince."
"165399380-0-14673";"I have failed in my duty. I could not defend the trophies of the supreme hunter, the Ivory Lord."
"165399380-0-14674";"I suffer eternal dishonor for failing my lady, the Emerald Princess. I am no longer worthy of the post I hold."
"165399380-0-14676";"Say the word, and I'll follow you into battle, captain."
"165399380-0-14677";"My sword is yours, Captain."
"165399380-0-14678";"Sheathe your weapon. I may be dead, but I am not your enemy."
"165399380-0-14679";"His lordship has a plan, but that's nothing new. He has plans coming out his ears. But this one might actually work out this time."
"165399380-0-14682";"We weren't sure if you'd be coming back to us."
"165399380-0-14708";"Please, we're dealing with serious matters here. The guardians are in desperate need of our aid and any interruption can have dire consequences."
"165399380-0-14720";"Sheathe your weapons. I am no wraith sent to drain your soul."
"165399380-0-14724";"You returned the sky-iron sword to my crypt. You are a true knight and I thank you for your efforts on my behalf."
"165399380-0-14725";"You have an entrepreneurial nature. Continue on this path and one day you'll be as wealthy as I was."
"165399380-0-14726";"You have the cunning and skills of a true hunter. May you always catch whatever prey you stalk."
"165399380-0-14727";"Our duty to High Rock did not end with our deaths. We shall always defend this land. Thank you for assisting us."
"165399380-0-14747";"I offer Mages Guild goods to members who qualify."
"165399380-0-14754";"Thank you. These ancient stones are precious to us."
"165399380-0-14762";"The Mages Guild battles alongside the Lion Guard this day. If we fail to reclaim Camlorn, this entire region will fall into darkness. \n\nWe're making final preparations now."
"165399380-0-14763";"First we lost Camlorn. Then they turned back our offensive. \n\nIf we can't retake this camp, Faolchu's beaten us. Nothing else matters until this is resolved."
"165399380-0-14793";"May the spirits of the Ansei watch over you, child."
"165399380-0-14794";"The corruption. It's gone! \n\nWe did a good thing here this day."
"165399380-0-14795";"The old magic returns. That gives me hope. We may yet restore the Wyrd Tree!"
"165399380-0-14796";"What Angof's doing here sickens me. It's a relief to finally be able to do something about it."
"165399380-0-14802";"I won't just stand here and watch our people die.\n\nGet General Gautier to give the order. My axe thirsts to taste werewolf blood!"
"165399380-0-14806";"Hold on, traveler. You don't want to go that way. \n\nFaolchu and his werewolf legion have taken Camlorn."
"165399380-0-14810";"How in Oblivion did you get in here?"
"165399380-0-14830";"Oh, thank goodness you've come! The bandits tossed us down here. They threatened to kill us!"
"165399380-0-14831";"I'll be all right. I stepped in front of Lord Noellaume to protect him. The Red Rooks didn't appreciate my loyalty."
"165399380-0-14841";"I can't believe we made it! I'm so glad to be out from under those bandits. Thank you!"
"165399380-0-14842";"Arm's not broken. Just sprained. I'll be all right. I can't thank you enough for helping us get out of there."
"165399380-0-14846";"This place is great! I love this place!\n\nI … so … wait a moment. This doesn't look like Aldcroft!"
"165399380-0-14847";"Who's drunk? I'm not drunk. You're drunk!"
"165399380-0-14848";"Hold your horses, I'll get to you in a moment.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, head over to the bar and talk to Phelain. He'd be happy to help you."
"165399380-0-14853";"Can you think of a better place to recruit guards? It's the best place to hear people boasting of great deeds."
"165399380-0-14856";"Your gold won't do anyone any good at the bottom of the well.\n\nInstead of throwing it in there, give it to me. That would certainly make my dream come true."
"165399380-0-14858";"Please help me. Please. A bit of gold for a poor, old woman."
"165399380-0-14859";"The forest aches. Angof's bane is upon it. We must end this."
"165399380-0-14860";"The guardians should have prevented this. Perhaps they aren't as powerful as we imagined."
"165399380-0-14861";"The guardians have provided us with so much through the ages. We must help them in return."
"165399380-0-14862";"I hate to see the trees that shelter us tortured and twisted by these … cultists! It's time to end this."
"165399380-0-14869";"Ah, a new recruit! We could certainly use the help out here."
"165399380-0-14872";"Thank Kynareth I found someone. Just let me catch my breath."
"165399380-0-14879";"I don't know what to do. It's all my fault. If the Duke dies, his blood will be on my hands."
"165399380-0-14883";"I hate meeting new people when I'm not at my best. Is my hair all right? Are my robes on straight?"
"165399380-0-14884";"You survived. Are you still all in one piece?"
"165399380-0-14885";"Good luck out there."
"165399380-0-14910";"A stranger who isn't dressed as a Bloodthorn? I don't know what you're doing out here, but you're a sight for sore eyes!\n\nNow hurry up and cut me loose."
"165399380-0-14919";"I don't understand it. Instead of using their resources to help people, the Bloodthorn cultists insist on causing all kinds of trouble.\n\nIt's such a shame."
"165399380-0-14921";"I can't decide what I want to read next. Should I go with something scholarly such as Glenumbra's People? Or am I in the mood for something a little lighter? Perhaps Lady Veronica's Best Friend?\n\nDecisions, decisions …."
"165399380-0-14922";"I'm writing the ultimate guide to the factions of the Daggerfall Covenant. It's going to be so much better than any of those previously published guides.\n\nYou don't look like much of a reader, though."
"165399380-0-14923";"The book I need used to be on this shelf, but now it's gone!\n\nVaruhl probably placed it on one of the higher shelves again. Just to annoy me."
"165399380-0-14924";"<This woman was in a struggle. She paid with her life.>"
"165399380-0-14925";"<This woman was involved in a struggle. She paid with her life.>"
"165399380-0-14935";"You have the look of a bowman, I think. Or do you wield the staff? Onsi shines on you this day, for I sell both!"
"165399380-0-14937";"This is for you, hero! Thanks again for that timely rescue."
"165399380-0-14970";"What brings you to our pleasant little city? The war? The blood? The thrice-damned werewolves?"
"165399380-0-15015";"The Wyrd Tree screams. The corrupting vines choke it from within.\n\nCan you hear its pain?"
"165399380-0-15030";"I have many fine wares for sale, O wayfarer."
"165399380-0-15031";"You've seen action, eh? Scars are like mugs of ale, friend. Having a few is great, but having too many is … well, no, that's good too. Bad metaphor. \n\nLook, just buy some armor, all right?"
"165399380-0-15038";"The earth weakens. Angof's poison corrupts it. Together we will crush this vile manifestation."
"165399380-0-15041";"Retribution must be swift. Angof will pay for his insolence!"
"165399380-0-15043";"This pollution is almost too much for me to bear. Help us restore balance to the Wyrd Tree."
"165399380-0-15047";"Wait! I'm not your enemy!"
"165399380-0-15050";"You're placing the sacred candles instead of my worthless descendant? Has he no shame at all?"
"165399380-0-15064";"What did great-grandfather tell you? Am I back in good graces?"
"165399380-0-15072";"My little boy's all grown up! I never thought this day would come!"
"165399380-0-15073";"I can't believe it! My baby brother is getting married before me!"
"165399380-0-15074";"I never thought I'd see the day that <<1>> got married. \n\nSeeing how happy he is, I've changed my mind. This is a good thing."
"165399380-0-15076";"I always get so emotional at weddings."
"165399380-0-15107";"There's nothing better than a night of drinking … except a day of even more drinking."
"165399380-0-15128";"I was hoping I'd see you again. I'm so much happier in Crosswych.\n\nMy family here has helped me move past my loss and start a new life."
"165399380-0-15137";"Are you injured? No? Then stop bothering me."
"165399380-0-15159";"The guardians do not answer our call. Without their guidance, we are lost.\n\nThis whole region will fall to the unnatural corruption you see before you."
"165399380-0-15160";"The magic of this forest sheltered us and cared for us. It has never failed us. In return, we must do everything we can to preserve it from Angof's corruption."
"165399380-0-15161";"The wounds inflicted by Angof's minions fester rapidly. They're difficult to heal."
"165399380-0-15163";"I don't care how tough you think you are. No one should go into battle without a good set of proper armor."
"165399380-0-15164";"A good weapon is better than food, better than drink. I sell very good weapons."
"165399380-0-15165";"The armor I sell didn't just fall off the back of a caravan wagon. It's the finest medium-weight armor that your gold can buy.\n\nI guarantee it!"
"165399380-0-15166";"My relief was supposed to be here hours ago! I'm supposed to be enjoying a nice hot bath right about now.\n\nDo you need a suit of light armor? It's cool and it doesn't chafe!"
"165399380-0-15167";"Oh! A customer! Can I help you choose something from our selection of fine woodcraft? Please? \n\nSorry I'm so excited. It's my first day."
"165399380-0-15168";"Spellcaster? I've got what you need."
"165399380-0-15178";"See someone else if you need orders, soldier."
"165399380-0-15179";"Yeah, what is it?"
"165399380-0-15182";"Yes? What is it?"
"165399380-0-15183";"The harsh winds of war sweep the lands of Cyrodiil. The Pact must ride those winds to victory!"
"165399380-0-15187";"It is a fine day for war, yes?"
"165399380-0-15190";"Sorry, soldier. Very busy here right now."
"165399380-0-15194";"Just look at those lost souls. What drives them? Why do they fight on?"
"165399380-0-15201";"Please help me. I'm supposed to find Wyress Ileana, but I'm afraid to go on. It's too dangerous out here."
"165399380-0-15204";"If it is in your heart… pray to Tu'whacca to guide the souls of our fallen to their final rest."
"165399380-0-15234";"Why do you linger, my love? Commander Parmion rallies the troops for the final assault. You're his best officer and our noblest knight. You should be at his side for this moment."
"165399380-0-15235";"The Alessians shall pay!"
"165399380-0-15236";"Be kind to each other. That is our way."
"165399380-0-15273";"<This knight has been slain with three precise slashes between the plates of his armor.>\n\n<The assassin who killed him must have been skilled.>"
"165399380-0-15301";"So much work, so little time."
"165399380-0-15313";"Can you help me? You've come from the woods. Did you meet one of our sisters, Wyress Ileana?\n\nWe haven't heard from her and we're very worried."
"165399380-0-15338";"I'm glad you came along when you did. I wasn't expecting an ambush on a routine inspection.\n\nI'll have to ply this one a bit more to get the answers I need. What did you find in the hold?"
"165399380-0-15351";"I saw them! They went north, toward the cliffs. A guard chased them!"
"165399380-0-15352";"Are you after the prince? They took him toward the cliffs! \n\nHurry!"
"165399380-0-15353";"I saw them running! They went west."
"165399380-0-15383";"By the Eight, look what they've done to my city. \n\nAnd now the Lion Guard is being driven from its own siege camp."
"165399380-0-15384";"Camlorn was a great city before Faolchu dug his claws into it. Just look what he's done."
"165399380-0-15418";"Seeking our help? If so, you're destined to be disappointed.\n\nThis is a dark time for the Beldama Wyrd. We have little aid to offer."
"165399380-0-15423";"Greetings. I am chamberlain to the king. How may I assist?"
"165399380-0-15440";"I haven't had to handle these kinds of problems since I left the Lion Guard. This is beyond what the wyrd sisters usually deal with."
"165399380-0-15455";"Out for a stroll? No? \n\nWhatever you're doing here, it's impressive you've made it this far."
"165399380-0-15459";"Don't pester me. I'm working on a cure. Go bother someone else for a while."
"165399380-0-15469";"Blessed Mara, why is this happening? What did we do to deserve this trouble? \n\nYou better go. They'll be back at any moment to demand more gold from me."
"165399380-0-15493";"I should never have lowered my guard! Thinking that the werewolves would remain in the city was a foolish mistake. I only hope we didn't lose too many lives because of it."
"165399380-0-15494";"The Mages Guild shall be helping the Lion Guard in the battle this day. If they fail to win and reclaim Camlorn, this entire region is at risk of falling to the darkness of the area. \n\nWe're making final preperations now."
"165399380-0-15495";"This might be the last thing these soldiers do in life. Unlike the others, I'll let my troops rest and enjoy each others company for now.\n\nOnce the battle starts, they'll be no more time for such pleasantries."
"165399380-0-15533";"To choose for oneself is simple. To choose for a nation is hard. The heaviest blade is as a feather compared to the trust of one's people.\n\nAbide with me and listen carefully."
"165399380-0-15534";"A goat will run if you strike it. A jackal may bite if you give chase. Only man can choose to do nothing. The path of restraint is often the hardest. I pose to you a question—one that still haunts me."
"165399380-0-15535";"All choices exact a toll, wayfarer. Some are trivial, but some … some linger for generations. I was forced to drink from a bitter cup in my time and all Redguards have paid the price. I wonder if you would have made the same choice."
"165399380-0-15536";"Great heroes often carry the greatest regrets. They lie buried in the sand with the bones and broken blades. Hidden. Forgotten. I had many stories to pass on, but only one is known. Hearken to me …."
"165399380-0-15548";"I was careless. I never thought they'd leave Camlorn to attack us. \n\nI only hope we didn't lose too many lives because of my mistake."
"165399380-0-15550";"It is good to see persons of renown traveling to <<1>> to train with our masters.\n\nI wish you well, traveler."
"165399380-0-15551";"I was careless. I never thought they'd leave Camlorn to attack us. \n\nI only hope we didn't lose too many lives because of my mistake."
"165399380-0-15560";"Know that the Eight themselves look down upon the masters and their students in <<1>>.\n\nOur actions can mean honor or dishonor for generations to come."
"165399380-0-15561";"Not a month goes by without a dozen new mouths to feed.\n\nStill, I've never felt safer than I do at <<1>>."
"165399380-0-15565";"O Noble One, I am a hard worker. Please, I just need a few coins to get back on my feet."
"165399380-0-15595";"Blood of the Forebears! Angof's minions are relentless."
"165399380-0-15598";"Blood of the forebears! Angof's minions are relentless."
"165399380-0-15601";"Return to your time. You learned that Faolchu's weakness is fire. Use that knowledge well.\n\nNow enter the nearby portal. It will take you home."
"165399380-0-15628";"What can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-15636";"You are the first to come here in many long centuries, since this place was sealed.\n\nI despaired of anyone ever finding their way here."
"165399380-0-15642";"You there! You can see me?"
"165399380-0-15650";"Hearken, wayfarer! An opportunity for honor presents itself. Are you open to this challenge?"
"165399380-0-15651";"That lunatic woman … Sep himself wouldn't step in her shadow!\n\nI'd stay off this path, lest she demand some humiliating task from you."
"165399380-0-15654";"And what do you come seeking?"
"165399380-0-15655";"Looking to crack some Daedric skulls? I've got what you need."
"165399380-0-15656";"Daedra don't go down easy. You need the right weapon for the job."
"165399380-0-15658";"What can the Fighters Guild do for you?"
"165399380-0-15691";"You are not marked with the corruption of undeath, nor those that foster it. You are not aligned with them, are you?"
"165399380-0-15692";"I'm not much good with a sword, but I'll do whatever Captain Darien asks of me."
"165399380-0-15696";"Before you speak, stranger, I would have words with you. For centuries, this cell has held me. You are not the first. Others tried to free me and failed.\n\nNo key will open this lock. No weapon will break these bonds."
"165399380-0-15709";"I should never have lowered my guard! \n\nWe're trying to take our camp back, but we're not having much luck."

"165399380-0-15743";"You make this hero business look almost as easy as I do.\n\nSomeday we'll return to that inn and I'll buy you a drink."
"165399380-0-15752";"I tried … but they got me with their evil magic!\n\nThey took the prince … down there. I think it leads out of the city! Please, go stop them!"
"165399380-0-15757";"You found him. I knew you would. The Withered Hand will not harm this family again. We'll see to that. \n\nSafe travels, friend."

"165399380-0-15824";"Welcome to Leki's Blade. Enter with an open heart and a steeled soul."
"165399380-0-15836";"You need to get out of here right now. These mists are poisonous and … wait, are you immune too? Mara's bosom, what's going on?"
"165399380-0-15837";"Saving the day again, eh? Can't say I'm surprised. \n\nBut I'm not about to let you have all the glory. There ought to be enough here for both of us."

"165399380-0-15843";"The great King Casimir sent us to stop Angof.\n\nWith the combined might of the Dragons, the Lion Guard, and you, Angof will surely fall."

"165399380-0-15965";"They killed Heseph. They gave Gelves everything he demanded to keep the townsfolk safe. Even surrendered his own house. \n\nThey killed Heseph anyway. Our beloved mayor. They killed him in cold blood!"

"165399380-0-15989";"I don't suppose you've seen a frightened tailor wandering about. \n\nHis name is Odei Philippe. I'm his wife and I very much want to find him."

"165399380-0-16061";"I'm going to have to sell more if I'm going to meet my quota for the month.\n\nOh, I'm sorry! Where are my manners? I'd like to offer you the finest armor money can buy. Not too heavy, but always strong enough to save your life!"
"165399380-0-16062";"Oh, hello! Just taking a break from working outside. I think I know exactly what you need!\n\nMy armor is so light, you'll forget it's even there."
"165399380-0-16063";"I love having an isolated, quiet place for our studies, but I must admit, some of the alchemists and enchanters working here tend to be a bit … melodramatic.\n\nThat's often the result of seclusion and scholarly pursuits."
"165399380-0-16072";"Have you ever seen such madness? Every farmer and family have fled to Evermore because of the Reachmen.\n\nIt'll only be a matter of time before the guards start turning them away. And then where will they go?"
"165399380-0-16084";"Have a care around those banekin, friend. They're small but vicious—I saw a man lose his foot to one just the other day."

"165399380-0-16123";"I wasn't always a merchant, you know. Believe me, it's not like I want to be one. Do I look like a salesman to you? \n\nDon't answer that."
"165399380-0-16124";"Greetings! I can see you have an eye for fashion. You'd look quite fetching in blue, I think …."

"165399380-0-16130";"Crosswych isn't the best place to visit right now. If you do enter the town, try not to get noticed by the Red Rooks.\n\nIf you're good in a fight, though, you could join our resistance. We could really use the help."
"165399380-0-16133";"I pity these foolish Bretons, with their hot iron casques and rusty metal plates. You and I know that in battle swiftness is best."
"165399380-0-16134";"Blessings be upon you. \n\nI apologize for my sparse stock, but we must take heart. In times like these even trifles feel like treasures."
"165399380-0-16135";"Brave meeting! Come to look over my gems? They can be yours … for the right price. \n\nPoint one out and let's make a deal."
"165399380-0-16136";"A fellow clothier, is it? Well, you've got your work cut out for you in Evermore. Some folk are wearing nothing but rags and bandages.\n\nGot a few things that might help. Take a look."
"165399380-0-16138";"If it's provisions you want, look elsewhere, stranger. Too many hungry mouths in Evermore nowadays."
"165399380-0-16139";"Looking for a weapon, eh? Well, If your enemy's got a head, I've got a blade that'll cut it off. \n\nHave a look for yourself."
"165399380-0-16140";"Hmm? Bah—let me sleep."
"165399380-0-16147";"I won't do it. I won't pay any more hard-earned gold to those Red Rook dogs. \n\nIt's time for action, I say!"
"165399380-0-16202";"These soldiers won't last much longer and I don't have enough magic to extend my ward to protect them.\n\nDarien told me about the amulets. Did you get them? With any luck, they'll work like the talisman you're carrying."
"165399380-0-16223";"Tamien sent word to the Lion Guard. They'll help us get the town back to normal."
"165399380-0-16224";"Thanks for reminding me of my duty. \n\nI'll make certain this never happens again."

"165399380-0-16228";"It's good to see you again.\n\nThese soldiers won't last much longer. Did you get the amulets Darien wanted?"
"165399380-0-16252";"You're <<1>>? You've made quite a name for yourself. I'd shake your hand, but I'm pretty sure something would snap.\n\nTo what do I owe the pleasure?"
"165399380-0-16297";"Traveling with mages always makes me queasy.\n\nI'll stay here and guard Gabrielle. Be careful out there."
"165399380-0-16327";"When I heard the King was sending troops up here to go after Faolchu's master, I wasn't about to be left out of the action. \n\nBy the way, is this your dog?"

"165399380-0-16332";"By the Eight, never creep up on a person. You're likely to get beheaded. \n\nYou must be Wizard Benele's friend."
"165399380-0-16333";"Stay back—this area's trapped. Don't get caught like I did. \n\nI've been watching to see how it works. The trap has guardians. They're the key to disarming it, I believe."
"165399380-0-16392";"That spirit. His gaze, so hard and cold. \n\nHe won't stop looking at me. He looks right through me. Why? Why am I so cold?"
"165399380-0-16430";"Greetings. You may believe fate brought you this way, led you to speak to me. I say: give the credit to your legs and your heart. They are what have brought you to me.\n\nI am working to prove that fate's bite has no sting."
"165399380-0-16477";"You're the Covenant scum who knocked me out and tied me up.\n\nI'm going to carve your heart out with a spoon."

"165399380-0-16500";"You are the one who wishes to destroy my master. \n\nI know what you seek. I would tell you if I could, but instead, I must thwart you."
"165399380-0-16501";"Someday, the Red Rooks will pay for what they've done here."
"165399380-0-16503";"Has it finally happened? Is this nightmare over?"

"165399380-0-17407";"Why is my father still a prisoner? This wasn't his fault!\n\nPlease, you must tell the guard to release him."
"165399380-0-17410";"Please, you have to listen to me! My family's in danger! No one will listen. No one!\n\nI'll tell you everything I know, but you have to help me. I'm begging you! If they know I've been captured, they'll kill them!"
"165399380-0-17417";"Hail, stranger! Welcome to Daggerfall. Have you come to aid in defense of this great Alliance against the unwashed hordes that seek to see us dead? Will you do your part to keep the Ebonheart Pack and the Aldmeri Dominion from killing us all?"
"165399380-0-17422";"Please, don't get involved."
"165399380-0-17424";"Please, don't get involved."
"165399380-0-17486";"I wanted to run. I should have run. Mother wanted us to go far, far away. But she's in no condition to go anywhere. Not really. \n\nAll I can hear are his whispers. Tainted-Heart found Camp Tamrith because of me."
"165399380-0-17511";"Something I can do for you?"
"165399380-0-17517";"I need someone to escort my brother!"
"165399380-0-17518";"I hear you're going to escort me."
"165399380-0-17587";"You! I know you.\n\nYou went into that tunnel up north, the one the Reachmen used."
"165399380-0-17621";"Did you see something on the horizon? I only came down for a moment."
"165399380-0-17640";"I thought I was hidden here!"
"165399380-0-17658";"Playing with the little girls of the forest? A game with me though, many have come to regret!\n\nHow exactly does my new playmate plan to win?"
"165399380-0-17697";"Looking for fine wordcraft and fair prices? I've got what you need!"
"165399380-0-17739";"We don't get many visitors nowadays. Don't get me wrong, though. I'm pleased to see another soul.\n\nI'd offer you something to eat, but I'm afraid I've already finished most of it."
"165399380-0-17750";"Don't get in my way."
"165399380-0-17761";"All the Khajiit do is complain, complain, complain. We've better things to do than pamper the pets."
"165399380-0-17762";"I'm not worried. Do I look worried? Then leave me alone."
"165399380-0-17770";"The sooner those unwanted guests leave, the better."
"165399380-0-17772";"How I long for a bit of quiet!"
"165399380-0-17794";"What can I get for you?"
"165399380-0-17832";"A bit of bruising and a few broken ribs won't stop me from getting my report to Shornhelm. I've got to let my superiors in House Tamrith know what happened at Crestshade."
"165399380-0-18053";"Not many still take to the waters. To me, it seems like a fine place to stay."
"165399380-0-18080";"You did it! I heard you were headed here, so I rushed over to help, but you had already finished before I arrived.\n\nI never thought, when we were scouting the Imperials near here, that you would be the one to kick them out of the garrison. Amazing!"
"165399380-0-18095";"Time is against us, my friend. I must remove the Remnant from this place before it is too late.\n\nI … I need you to do something for me first, though."
"165399380-0-18101";"Hi."
"165399380-0-18110";"For the last time, stay out of ….\n\nOh, apologies. You are not another one of those Evermore soldiers. We have been trying to keep them out of the Reachmen's camp, for their safety and ours. But, like most, their skulls are too thick to understand."
"165399380-0-18136";"Can't you see I'm busy?"
"165399380-0-18159";"Come closer, my friend, and look upon my armor! Do you see the fine metal rings? The shining buckles? True craftsmanship is in the details!"
"165399380-0-18192";"I'm not here to cause trouble. I've earned a living in the desert for the past twenty years. I know what you'll need. Would you like to see my wares?"
"165399380-0-18198";"Adventure? Interested in gore and glory, hm? Well, hard to keep at it when you're hungry! Step up and buy your fill."
"165399380-0-18208";"Everyone deserves variety in their diet. I provide that."
"165399380-0-18209";"Oh! Popped in for a bit of a respite as well, I see.\n\nIf you'd like some provisions, I might be able to help you out while we're both resting in here."
"165399380-0-18220";"Begone, accursed thing! I … hmm … you're not a bloodfiend. \n\nPlease, whoever you are, help us. Help the spirits of Crestshade. They tore our spirits from our living flesh."
"165399380-0-18238";"Stranger, I'm surprised to see any friendly faces out here.\n\nDid you meet any Covenant soldiers on the road?"
"165399380-0-18239";"If you're looking for pleasant conversation, find a bard.\n\nI'm looking for soldiers, not friends."
"165399380-0-18317";"Welcome to the war.\n\nWe're losing ground to Covenant raiders. If we don't hold the line here, they'll push us back to Ebonheart and take all of Zabamat."
"165399380-0-18320";"Whatever happens, we can't let the Covenant retrieve the Coral Heart."
"165399380-0-18321";"You've been in the belly of Daggerfall's beast. Did you find <<1>>?"
"165399380-0-18322";"<This soldier was stabbed in the back.>"
"165399380-0-18365";"I'm Holgunn, the Nord commander here in Davon's Watch. My men are the spine and strong arm of the Ebonheart Pact. \n\nI've heard good things about you. Let's see if they're true."
"165399380-0-18366";"I am Grandmaster Tanval, commander of House Indoril. \n\nI've heard of you. You may be of help."
"165399380-0-18367";"I'm the Nord commander here in Davon's Watch. We are the spine and strong arm of the Ebonheart Pact."
"165399380-0-18372";"Welcome to what used to be the front lines, soldier. Something very strange is happening out here.\n\nI'm just a grunt. And not a very smart grunt, at that. Maybe you can sort things out for me."
"165399380-0-18373";"What? Today, of all days? What was it about today that made these spirits become so restless?"
"165399380-0-18375";"Ahknara ambushed us. She used a flask of blinding light to stun us, then ran back through the door behind me.\n\nWere you able to activate the plates?"
"165399380-0-18376";"Are the assassins now feeding the earth with their blood and bone?"
"165399380-0-18377";"Are you here to help? There's much to do, but the Dunmer and Argonians aren't even talking to each other!"
"165399380-0-18378";"Stranger, you've picked a bad time to visit Senie. \n\nThe volcano's burning up the town! You'd think these thick-headed louts would accept some help."
"165399380-0-18379";"Look at the devastation! And in the face of all this, they still argue.\n\nYou can't believe it either, can you?"
"165399380-0-18380";"Stranger, you have come at a bad time. The ground bleeds, and many are hurt.\n\nIf you wish my time, first you must help."
"165399380-0-18405";"Blessings of the Three, traveler."
"165399380-0-18412";"<This soldier has several stab wounds on her back and neck. The assassins must have ambushed her.>\n\n<Someone ran across the floor and used the trapdoor in the corner. Strikes-from-Shadows may be down there.>"
"165399380-0-18414";"I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it."
"165399380-0-18415";"Is it bad?"
"165399380-0-18419";"Thanks for helping us on the Starved Plain.\n\nWith the spirits guarding us, we need not fear on this front."
"165399380-0-18436";"Captain Hjolm will be forever honored, along with the others slain here. Their deaths will fuel our conviction to slaughter the Covenant."
"165399380-0-18481";"Help me. By the Three, set me free!"
"165399380-0-18498";"Why are you here, stranger?"
"165399380-0-18506";"This is not a good day for Senie, traveler."
"165399380-0-18523";"The brazier, did you light it? Did you do anything to it?"
"165399380-0-18524";"Quietly! The enemy abounds. What do you seek?"
"165399380-0-18529";"Those tents … they seem so far away.\n\nWhat? So what if I'm lazy?"
"165399380-0-18531";"Someone came! Did Father send you?\n\nI fell and twisted something. Damn my ankle!"
"165399380-0-18533";"These warmer climes warp our fine northern wood terribly. I feel like I'm constantly making repairs."
"165399380-0-18536";"Did you hear? There's been another murder!"
"165399380-0-18549";"You're standing a little close, don't you think?"
"165399380-0-18550";"I have heard of your deeds. Finally, we meet!"
"165399380-0-18568";"Why do you insist on interfering, dryskin?"
"165399380-0-18570";"You don't look to be Daggerfall Covenant, and you're not one of ours. Who are you?"
"165399380-0-18578";"You have to get the Heart."
"165399380-0-18582";"<Sings-With-Reed says nothing. Her attention seems focused inward.>"
"165399380-0-18584";"A traveler. This is a strange time to visit Senie."
"165399380-0-18589";"Ready to wring some Orc necks?"
"165399380-0-18598";"Well, you're a warm hut in a blizzard.\n\nWhat news? Could you keep that <<1>> out of the Covenant's hands?"
"165399380-0-18640";"Praise Vivec, child. Tell me you're here to pray instead of fight.\n\nIt pains me to see this holy site bathed in impure blood."
"165399380-0-18642";"Um, your pardon. Have you seen any kwama around? Maybe west of the town?\n\nIf you do, I don't suppose you could lead them to my mine, could you?"
"165399380-0-18643";"I, uh … your pardon. Have you seen any kwama around? Maybe west of the town?\n\nI don't suppose you could lead them to my mine, could you?"
"165399380-0-18647";"I'll wait right here."
"165399380-0-18661";"What can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-18662";"I stand ready to assist <<1>>."
"165399380-0-18663";"Welcome, traveler."
"165399380-0-18691";"The destruction! The loss of life! This slaughter was totally unnecessary."
"165399380-0-18706";"Help me, outsider."
"165399380-0-18707";"We'll gather up the survivors and begin our work anew. The afflicted need us, and they need the Tear.\n\nI'll just try to keep in mind that I always need to look before I leap."
"165399380-0-18715";"He's dead."
"165399380-0-18718";"Be wary of Khralek."
"165399380-0-18723";"Troll's blood! Why have you come for training today? Fort Arand is under threat.\n\nThe Covenant stands poised to gut us as easily as a horker lazing in the sun."
"165399380-0-18727";"Orcs to the south, mercenaries camped outside by the lake, and now people are missing.\n\nI'm not sure how much more we can take."
"165399380-0-18754";"How do you fight something you can't see? It isn't fair!\n\nI can't cut the throat of the plague. I can't smash its bones. I can only wait until it fills me with its blackness and takes my life bit by bit."
"165399380-0-18755";"It's about time you showed up! I was beginning to get a bit charred around the edges."
"165399380-0-18757";"I told you, we're leaving this forsaken place. I'd rather ….\n\nWait. You're not my husband! What do you want? Narsis isn't safe, stranger. Not that House Hlaalu cares."
"165399380-0-18758";"Vivec guide you, traveler."
"165399380-0-18759";"My head. Where am I?"
"165399380-0-18760";"I don't suppose you're here to buy a weapon?\n\nNo, you probably just want me to fix another wagon wheel or something. Everyone just wants to get out of here."
"165399380-0-18761";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-18772";"Shade find you."
"165399380-0-18773";"You! What are you doing here? Why do you disturb me?"
"165399380-0-18781";"I'm sure that witch is around here somewhere."
"165399380-0-18789";"I don't know why I put up with him."
"165399380-0-18813";"Running is hard work."
"165399380-0-18814";"Why has our village suffered so?"
"165399380-0-18818";"Who are you, stranger? Were you sent by the Tribunal?\n\nNo, of course not. What would they care for the problems of five little people grubbing in the dirt for a living?"
"165399380-0-18819";"My wounds will heal."
"165399380-0-18821";"I know this place. We made our last stand here, many years ago.\n\nGone! Why am I here? Why have I been summoned?"
"165399380-0-18823";"Wait. This is where the final battle took place. Why am I here?"
"165399380-0-18824";"Run, friend! Get out of here before the Covenant soldiers come back!\n\nI'm staying put, so I can direct other survivors to safety. But if I see another Dagger uniform, I'm leaving!"
"165399380-0-18826";"""Just read some old runes,"" he said. He didn't mention how … active the dead are here."
"165399380-0-18827";"What are you doing? Hide, fool!"
"165399380-0-18830";"These filthy pirates want to sell us all into slavery. Please, find a way to save us!"
"165399380-0-18840";"A Brother of Strife walks near Ash Mountain, so the Ordinators sent me to learn how bind it. ""Read some old runes,"" they said. ""No danger,"" they said.\n\nThe dead are very active. I need help."
"165399380-0-18848";"I have much to do. The fate of Narsis hangs in the balance!"
"165399380-0-18849";"So you're the guar who raised me.\n\nThis had better be astonishingly important, or I'll do unspeakable things to your fleshy mortal form."
"165399380-0-18851";"These cursed shalk are after my blood. They've got me pinned here. Please, help me!"
"165399380-0-18853";"Ugh! Please, help me."
"165399380-0-18857";"Augh. It burns!"
"165399380-0-18859";"Why? Why did they do this?"
"165399380-0-18897";"You've done us a great service, friend."
"165399380-0-18914";"You judge us from another era, but you should know: we could have chosen power or chosen death. \n\nIf power destroyed the enemy, then nothing else matters."
"165399380-0-18915";"The Chimer were powerful. We thought we could face any challenge. Even at the end, we were arrogant and proud. \n\nBut I will not believe our sacrifice was in vain."
"165399380-0-18940";"Did you need something? I don't have as many things to sell as I did before the war, but you might see something useful."
"165399380-0-18942";"I know it seems strange that I'm in this dark place, but the pain of losing him once was unbearable. \n\nI can't lose him again."
"165399380-0-18952";"Common filth! You dare to disturb my slumber?"
"165399380-0-18953";"What is this thing, Eanen? Why is it looking at us?"
"165399380-0-18971";"The roads aren't safe, but I haven't a choice if I want to sell my goods, do I? Why don't you buy something from me and make my journey worth the while?"
"165399380-0-18978";"I couldn't find him. Did you?"
"165399380-0-18981";"You bother me now? Half-wit!"
"165399380-0-18985";"I had to change my breeches before I came home. Don't tell my father."
"165399380-0-18986";"I hope this war with the Covenant ends soon, preferably with us slaying their men, selling their women and children into slavery, burning their towns, and salting their fields.\n\nThose ruthless barbarians deserve no better."
"165399380-0-18987";"Your help is appreciated, outsider."
"165399380-0-18988";"You cannot put the yolk back in its shell."
"165399380-0-18999";"Why do you meddle in our affairs?"
"165399380-0-19003";"These once-fertile lands have been reduced to ash and dust.\n\nMy fair <<1>> must be ashamed of me. I am a poor protector."
"165399380-0-19004";"Have a care, traveler. My lord Hrogar's fields are overrun with hideous Goblins and spiders. Whatever business you have here, best come back another day."
"165399380-0-19005";"These Goblins are merciless, stranger. They don't feel pity or remorse or fear, and they won't stop until they're killed."
"165399380-0-19006";"I wish I could make them pay for what they've done!"
"165399380-0-19029";"This once-grand hall has been reduced to ruins."
"165399380-0-19030";"Watch out, traveler. Troll's bones, the Goblins could be upon us any moment!\n\nI won't go down easy."
"165399380-0-19031";"We've been members of the Fighters Guild forever. In fact, that's how my wife and I met! When we retired from all the fighting, it just made sense to go into business selling what we know. And we do know our weapons!"
"165399380-0-19032";"My stock isn't what it used to be, what with the war and all. But I still have a decent selection, if you want to have a look."
"165399380-0-19033";"These are hard times, my friend. I hope you find something to your liking. I could certainly use the gold."
"165399380-0-19034";"Some armor can be too light, and some armor can be much too bulky and heavy. But the armor I carry is just right. Take a look and see for yourself."
"165399380-0-19037";"If you're going to be dabbling in the arcane, I can tell you that quality ingredients are essential. Unless you don't mind singeing your eyebrows, that is."
"165399380-0-19038";"Ooooh… my head…. where am I?"
"165399380-0-19039";"No matter the troubles assaulting our fair city, my vault stands strong. You may bank with me in complete confidence. Your personal items will be perfectly safe within our secure facility."
"165399380-0-19041";"Oh, good! Someone new! I was worried that business would be slow, what with the rumors of war and vampires and all.\n\nFeel free to look around and don't hesitate to let me know if you need any help!"
"165399380-0-19046";"I saw the Goblins capture Gar. They took him into a cave near the beach.\n\nPlease, you've got to save my brother!"
"165399380-0-19050";"Nice to see someone who's not walking around looking like their pig just died. Let me know if there's anything you need."
"165399380-0-19087";"Well met! The Vale of the Ghost Snake doesn't get many visitors."
"165399380-0-19096";"The dreugh attacks have killed most of my kinsmen. I thirst for revenge but <<1>>, has stayed my hand."
"165399380-0-19099";"And what do you think of that … man?"
"165399380-0-19100";"What do you want, outsider?"
"165399380-0-19101";"Strangers aren't welcome here. Be on your way."
"165399380-0-19128";"<The dog whines anxiously.>"
"165399380-0-19142";"I hate relying on others, but I owe you my life. I will not forget that. If it wasn't for you and Drathyra, I'd be ashes in our ancestral hearth."
"165399380-0-19144";"Thank you for helping me save my mother. I'm sorry I panicked. It won't happen again. \n\nThere's more steel in me than even my father suspects."
"165399380-0-19148";"I'm sure the Covenant troops have eaten them all.\n\nUncivilized savages."
"165399380-0-19150";"Reconsidered my offer?"
"165399380-0-19158";"I've never seen Hrogar so drawn down by sorrow. It pains me."
"165399380-0-19165";"Well, look who's back! Good to see you again."
"165399380-0-19166";"Siege weapons win wars, no matter what the generals tell you."
"165399380-0-19168";"If you question the value of siege weapons, try to take an enemy keep without them!"
"165399380-0-19169";"Hail! <<1>> wants all able bodied fighters to report to him immediately."
"165399380-0-19170";"So many people have left or simply disappeared. My profits are falling faster than the level of mead in a Nord fest hall. Please tell me you're here to buy something!"
"165399380-0-19171";"By the Three! Good to see you again, my friend."
"165399380-0-19174";"Rest assured, the Maulborn pose no threat to House Hlaalu. My husband guarantees it."
"165399380-0-19183";"While you wait for the cure, my fine wares will keep you strong and healthy."
"165399380-0-19187";"It was chaos. Pure chaos."
"165399380-0-19210";"Welcome, landstrider. Good to see you again."
"165399380-0-19213";"Ah, the landstrider! Welcome to the war."
"165399380-0-19215";"Did you find him?"
"165399380-0-19216";"I've got a message for you!"
"165399380-0-19217";"How could he be so stupid? I told him where to deliver the shipment. But he thinks he knows everything! That's why things get messed up.\n\nMy apologies. Just talking to myself. Don't mind me."
"165399380-0-19223";"Please, you have to get this crazy woman away from me! I've done nothing, but she keeps insisting I'm a smuggler or something.\n\nI'm innocent!"
"165399380-0-19225";"I have no intention of letting an amateur screw up my investigation.\n\nTurn around and walk away. Now."
"165399380-0-19227";"How curious to see a creature like you."
"165399380-0-19236";"Didn't my messenger reach you?\n\nNo matter. You're here now. Speak."
"165399380-0-19240";"It's true. I was cowering here when Mavos cast his spell . Don't worry,  I was hoping you'd survive the entire time. \n\nAhem. Do you know how to bind Balreth?"
"165399380-0-19241";"Father was sure Balreth was the only way to defeat the Covenant army. But it seems he may have been a bit hasty in his actions."
"165399380-0-19245";"Please, help me. My son died before my very eyes. What do I do?"
"165399380-0-19246";"Here to kill me? I wouldn't blame you. But save this mage, at least. \n\nYou can leave me to die."
"165399380-0-19257";"I have no quarrel with you. We shall speak.\n\nBut know that if you would help those trying to murder our Hist, I will speak with my teeth instead of my tongue."
"165399380-0-19259";"Writhing worm. You have no idea what you've done."
"165399380-0-19260";"Wretched meatsack. Let me return to the dream of death."
"165399380-0-19268";"He killed them all. They're all dead."
"165399380-0-19269";"Say something. Speak now, before I hack you apart!"
"165399380-0-19270";"<Ulov glares at you.>"
"165399380-0-19272";"We were going to expand the plantation. We wanted to trade the useless cat-men for some strong Bretons and Redguards."
"165399380-0-19273";"He hasn't said anything. Hasn't moved. He's just watching."
"165399380-0-19275";"You bring Ra-shadda the Idol of the Hollow Moon, yes? Moons guide you, stranger."
"165399380-0-19279";"Beware, soldier. There's a curse on the keep."
"165399380-0-19280";"Have you seen my husband? We got separated when those Khajiiti animals started rioting."
"165399380-0-19281";"Ha ha! It's all green. Can't you see it?"
"165399380-0-19305";"Soldier! There is a curse on the keep!"
"165399380-0-19317";"What do you want, outsider?"
"165399380-0-19319";"Watch your step among the Mabrigash, outsider."
"165399380-0-19320";"I'm a respected House Hlaalu merchant. How dare they treat me this way!"
"165399380-0-19321";"Miserable, cowardly Khajiit!"
"165399380-0-19324";"I hope they suffered at your hands!"
"165399380-0-19326";"The undead fascinate me. Their energies are so potent."
"165399380-0-19329";"Keep your voice down and act like you're helping me.\n\nI can't go into details. Not here. But I know you've been trying to find the missing people for House Hlaalu."
"165399380-0-19336";"<Star is a cat. Upon closer examination, you notice a small silver key hanging around the cat's neck. She seems well-trained for a city cat.>"
"165399380-0-19338";"I hate all this waiting around."
"165399380-0-19372";"At least the plague doesn't hurt the plants. That would be a shame."
"165399380-0-19373";"I've done nothing wrong, I promise. Please don't take me away.\n\nI'll find a way to pay for the bread. I swear it!"
"165399380-0-19375";"Living trash. You have no idea what you've done."
"165399380-0-19376";"Begone! Your living breath pollutes our bone-dry air."
"165399380-0-19379";"You found us. I apologize for my earlier abruptness. \n\nWe heard you confirmed that our people were taken."
"165399380-0-19380";"You must be the one Slips told us about. She said an outsider was hired to find our people.\n\nThat's a strange thing for an outsider to do, even for Hlaalu gold. What are you really up to?"
"165399380-0-19381";"Madras has a plan. And with your help, it's sure to succeed."
"165399380-0-19382";"House Hlaalu can lock the gates, but they can't lock up the truth.\n\nIf the guards won't help, we'll do it ourselves. Damn Hlaalu! Damn the plague! I just want my family back."
"165399380-0-19385";"How did you get in there? Madras doesn't let just anyone attend his secret meetings.\n\nWait! You're the outsider working for Councilor Ralden. Please tell me you haven't bought into Madras's foolishness."
"165399380-0-19401";"Sick workers, poison fumes, enraged kwama … could anything else go wrong?"
"165399380-0-19403";"Sorry, I haven't time for pleasantries. We're having a bit of a crisis, here."
"165399380-0-19404";"Were you successful in the mines?"
"165399380-0-19405";"Come and join us. This spot is safe, above the smelly fumes. Safe for the little scribbles."
"165399380-0-19424";"Don't judge us too harshly. We do things our own way here."
"165399380-0-19432";"Everyone screaming, everyone dying. Why do you taunt me, filth?"
"165399380-0-19434";"The wind is alive with butterscotch! Can't you feel it?"
"165399380-0-19468";"Before you ask, yes, I've been following you. No, I have nothing to do with the missing people or the plague. And no, I'm not here to fight you.\n\nThere, that's out of the way. Feel better? Now let's talk about why Giron wants you dead."
"165399380-0-19470";"Ralden isn't here. He and Giron left some time ago.\n\nAnd Giron's connection to the Maulborn makes me a little concerned."
"165399380-0-19471";"There you are, outsider. I came as quickly as I could.\n\nMadras and the others left for the ruins. They want to save our people but they're going to get themselves killed."
"165399380-0-19489";"Curious how some people want to escape the plague, while others continue to arrive.\n\nI wonder why that is?"
"165399380-0-19511";"I'm such a fool! Why did I think a gang of untrained villagers could handle this? I led them to their deaths, and it's my fault."
"165399380-0-19512";"Giron betrayed me. He killed our people. Put Llodos plague in the corpses. Said it made it more potent. He bled them into the lake."
"165399380-0-19515";"What brings you to this gods-forsaken Dark Elf dung hole? The beer in this land is fit only for pigs. Good thing we brought our own.\n\nHave the Elves asked you to help beat back the Covenant yet? Bah! To Sovngarde with them."
"165399380-0-19518";"Still alive, I see. I suppose that justifies Naryu's confidence in you.\n\nDid you find them? How's Ralden? Are they inside?"
"165399380-0-19522";"I've got the key and the location you seek, as promised.\n\nOur plan might have worked a little too well. You can still hear screams coming out of Madras's house."
"165399380-0-19526";"Giron betrayed me. He killed our people and put Llodos plague into their bodies. Said it made it more potent.\n\nHe needed a large supply of potential corpses. That's why he wanted Narsis locked down."
"165399380-0-19529";"Soldier, be warned. There's a curse on the keep."
"165399380-0-19536";"Things have been strange around the fort lately."
"165399380-0-19537";"An army travels on its stomach, and this one won't get anywhere without me."
"165399380-0-19610";"Welcome, traveler. We don't have much yet, but I can show you what's in stock if you like."
"165399380-0-19641";"Ohhh … ahhh … snakes …."
"165399380-0-19643";"The snakes are agitated. They sense something is happening in the Vale."
"165399380-0-19678";"The pain of losing him once was unbearable. I can't lose him again."
"165399380-0-19679";"I can't find him. \n\nSo hard to go on without him."
"165399380-0-19680";"I won't lose him again."
"165399380-0-19682";"Soldier! There's a curse on the keep."
"165399380-0-19683";"This pain is so hard to bear."
"165399380-0-19687";"If you're looking for honest work, look elsewhere. There's little enough of that to go around.\n\nAnything dishonest goes through One-Eye, unless you want to find out how she got that name. Catch my meaning?"
"165399380-0-19688";"Don't trust the mead here, friend. If you're lucky, they'nt done nothin' more than piss in it."
"165399380-0-19689";"Rich times for some, not for all. Chee-Dooka and I have been … less than fortunate.\n\nBut, the sea brings new breeze each day. That is the saying, is it not?"
"165399380-0-19690";"No, these breads are Eilara's! No stealing!"
"165399380-0-19693";"Hard enough making a living with the tariffs from Skyrim. Now the elf Houses want their cut! Not to mention the thieves right before me!\n\nWhen I next head north, perhaps I'll stay there."
"165399380-0-19695";"I thought coming home would mean the end of hardship. Turns out, It's no easy feat to feed a family in the swamps."
"165399380-0-19697";"I take my creature comforts as they come. You don't know when you'll next have a warm meal or a dry spot to nap."
"165399380-0-19705";"I have no reassurance to offer. Do what you think best in the time remaining."
"165399380-0-19713";"<This corpse has stretched, bruised flesh. Its clothes are soaked with blood. Judging from the exit wound in the soldier's back, something tore its way out of her from within.>"
"165399380-0-19716";"<Tiril glares at you.>"
"165399380-0-19725";"No one keeps their forge as hot as an Avani. You'd have to journey to the heart of Ash Mountain to find a fire this strong. \n\nYou're welcome to work … if you think you can handle it."
"165399380-0-19727";"My Lady Almalexia bids you carry a message to Disciple Sildras."
"165399380-0-19748";"The Llodos plague is a curse upon us! A curse, I say!"
"165399380-0-19750";"Speak."
"165399380-0-19751";"I appear at my lord's behest.\n\nOr perhaps I was always here, and you merely lacked the ability to see me."
"165399380-0-19756";"Step up, step up. Ahhh… you look like a fine player, yes. No silly games for you. No. Not for you. You are a true adventurous spirit, a gambler. Perhaps I can convince you to try a -real- game. What do you say?"
"165399380-0-19759";"We'll all be reunited in Sovngarde, won't we? That's what I tell myself."
"165399380-0-19762";"If you're planning to use the pass to Mournhold, find another route. It's not safe."
"165399380-0-19764";"Gods, why did I ever set foot in this stinking pit? Was it duty or stupidity?\n\nCome to mock me like the rest, have you? Well, fear not. I've no dignity left."
"165399380-0-19768";"I'm waiting."
"165399380-0-19777";"I speak to <<1>>, and only her."
"165399380-0-19780";"This place has seen better days."
"165399380-0-19782";"If you're here to complain about that Dominion soldier, I've heard everything already."
"165399380-0-19789";"Need to report back. Maulborn. They're trying to make the plague stronger."
"165399380-0-19790";"<<1>>'s the name. I was working as a guard in the trading camp before the Maulborn attacked. \n\nThis Elven scout was lucky I came along when I did. She was getting her arse handed to her."
"165399380-0-19795";"I fear I've done terrible harm to the morale of my people in Ebonheart.\n\nI will do all I can to convince them to work with House Dres. They, at least, have been constant in their defense against the Daggerfall invaders."
"165399380-0-19810";"Shadowfen is full of challenges."
"165399380-0-19811";"What?"
"165399380-0-19812";"I'm eager to prove my worth."
"165399380-0-19813";"New challengers are always welcome."
"165399380-0-19827";"I've heard the stories about Ahknara, but she's a Redguard, not a Daedra."
"165399380-0-19851";"I purchase what I need from our allies.\n\nFor the Ebonheart Pact! Blood and glory!"
"165399380-0-19852";"What an amazing thing, this Ebonheart Pact. Safety, strength in numbers, and increased profits.\n\nWhat can I get for you today?"
"165399380-0-19853";"I love our new alliance! Now I can sell to three times as many people!"
"165399380-0-19855";"Master Samtri always talks about walking the narrow path, but I just want to learn how to cast spells and such."
"165399380-0-19856";"Anchors fall from the sky! Daedra spill from the shadows!\n\nSometimes it feels like we're the only thing keeping this world together. Pray we don't fail."
"165399380-0-19857";"We learn to anticipate the ebb and flow of Magicka.\n\nThat's the difference between an acolyte and a mage."
"165399380-0-19858";"Fear not. I intend no mayhem."
"165399380-0-19859";"The Eight provide all the protection I need, but I do look good in heavy armor."
"165399380-0-19860";"I've all manner of potables for the discerning palate. Care to look over my stock?"
"165399380-0-19861";"The path to enlightenment is exceedingly narrow and must be tread carefully. Are you prepared to walk this path?"
"165399380-0-19862";"A chicken in every cooking pot! It's more than a house councilor's promise. It's a way of life when you strive to create the perfect bite!"
"165399380-0-19863";"Anyone can pick up a sword. Learning not to cut yourself with it requires dedication and constant practice."
"165399380-0-19865";"This place is great! I can't wait for my turn to dance in the fire pit."
"165399380-0-19867";"Not all members of House Hlaalu are simple merchants. I deal in alchemy. But I only work with the most advanced practitioners of the craft."
"165399380-0-19868";"You need something. I know you need something. Something alchemical, perhaps? What do you need?"
"165399380-0-19869";"Welcome to the Flaming Nix. Our fire pit adds a level of entertainment not seen in the other, so-called, finer establishments."
"165399380-0-19871";"My enchantments are the finest in the land. But quality has a cost my friend, quality has a cost."
"165399380-0-19874";"Welcome, friend. You won't find a better stable in all of Morrowind!"
"165399380-0-19877";"My weapons are without equal. They are oiled, sharpened, and polished to perfection. Leave lesser weapons to farmers and footpads. Heroes deserve the best."
"165399380-0-19879";"I like to write poetry when the forge isn't too busy. Someday, I'll be as famous as Fjokki!"
"165399380-0-19882";"Benus believes that his weapons are without equal. That's only because they've never been tested against my armor."
"165399380-0-19883";"I really can't talk right now. Master Benus would rather we didn't mingle during business hours."
"165399380-0-19884";"I erect the spine of welcome. Welcome to the bank of Mournhold."
"165399380-0-19885";"Don't leave town without the proper equipment! Let me get you outfitted right."
"165399380-0-19886";"What do you need today? I just received a new shipment, so take a look at what's in stock."
"165399380-0-19887";"Welcome, friend. What bit of arcane wonder can I sell you today?"
"165399380-0-19888";"My armor can withstand a charging ogrim. Can your armor do that? I don't think so."
"165399380-0-19889";"You look like someone who appreciates a good weapon."
"165399380-0-19890";"I know exactly what you need. You won't find better deals anywhere else in the city!"
"165399380-0-19891";"Be welcome and wallow. Gaze upon this wonderful armor and prepare to open your gold pouch very wide."
"165399380-0-19892";"If you're looking for the Bank of Mournhold, you've come to the right place. Your valuables will be safe with us."
"165399380-0-19893";"Care to trade in your old bag for a larger one? I'll give you a great deal."
"165399380-0-19895";"Welcome to Hissmir, stranger."
"165399380-0-19901";"Our curse is misunderstood by outsiders. We wish to remain here in peace, as we always have."
"165399380-0-19929";"Those nix-hounds won't take me! Won't make me into a husk.\n\nBled myself with my own blade. No use to them now. That'll show them."
"165399380-0-19931";"Looking to craft some sturdy lightweight armor? War's at our doorstep, so now's the time."
"165399380-0-19933";"You look like you can handle yourself in a fight. The Pact needs your help here."
"165399380-0-19934";"I knew someone would come to free me. Vivec wouldn't allow his priestess to suffer like this.\n\nHe sent you, didn't he?"
"165399380-0-19949";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-19950";"Pardon my tears. I recently lost my wife, and ….\n\nI'm sorry. Can I help you?"
"165399380-0-19960";"Who are you? What do you want with me?"
"165399380-0-19965";"<Tiril glares at you.>"
"165399380-0-19967";"Didn't my messenger find you? \n\nNo matter. You're here now. Talk to me."
"165399380-0-19974";"Care for a drink?"
"165399380-0-19975";"Please, I need your help!"
"165399380-0-19976";"You approach the Vale of the Ghost Snake. Tread carefully, outsider."
"165399380-0-19978";"Visitors to Stillrise Village are rare.\n\nHave you spoken to our chief? You should pay your respects."
"165399380-0-19979";"A stranger to Stillrise? You have some surprises in store for you here.\n\nIf you haven't spoken to <<1>>, you should."
"165399380-0-19984";"Good day. What are you drinking?"
"165399380-0-20007";"We perform an important service, you know. If not for us, the Dark Elves would never see a massive log or a long, smooth piece of wood … especially the lady Elves, if you know what I mean."
"165399380-0-20008";"I signed up to guard these wagons for the money. And guarding's the only thing I take money for. You got that?"
"165399380-0-20009";"I tried the drink at the inn, but I think I'll stick with our own mead.\n\nI can't take this local stuff. It's made out of mold or something."
"165399380-0-20010";"Some of the boys like to flirt with the Elf girls. I don't know why. They're so little. There's nothing to them!"
"165399380-0-20024";"Welcome to <<1>>.."
"165399380-0-20037";"I tried to visit the Maulborn camp. Figured they'd need some work done on their boots. But they sent me away.\n\nHow rude is that?"
"165399380-0-20041";"The grandmaster is very busy today. Move along."
"165399380-0-20052";"This Khajiit is not here to challenge. You have won your right to lead. All here will follow you, if you spare them!"
"165399380-0-20054";"The Trials are not for the faint of heart."
"165399380-0-20060";"They came out of nowhere. Attacked the caravan. I'm fine, I just hope my brother's all right."
"165399380-0-20061";"We never had a chance."
"165399380-0-20062";"Don't tell my sister, but I'm not really injured. I'm just terrified."
"165399380-0-20083";"Yes, yes. Finally, a discerning customer."
"165399380-0-20090";"We were going to expand the plantation. We wanted to trade the useless cat-men for some strong Orcs and Nords."
"165399380-0-20092";"Welcome to <<1>>."
"165399380-0-20093";"This plantation was built on suffering. It's only right that it should end in suffering."
"165399380-0-20107";"I'm not getting paid enough for this."
"165399380-0-20111";"By Sithis, keep your head down! Activate the Zaht stones and drive back the Kothringi!"
"165399380-0-20112";"What can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-20113";"You need something?"
"165399380-0-20117";"Ughhh."
"165399380-0-20130";"My love, I've found the right mixture. You've heard it before, I know, but this time I feel it in my scales.\n\nDrinking this will allow me … allow all of us … to commune with the Hist. We'll regain what our people lost!"
"165399380-0-20134";"Years of work, and it all comes to this. I almost don't believe it."
"165399380-0-20144";"Will you hear my plea?"
"165399380-0-20145";"<This Khajiit is carrying a map and a sealed message addressed to ""Vahara."" An area north of the plantation is circled on the map.>"
"165399380-0-20146";"<This dead Khajiit clutches a message.>"
"165399380-0-20147";"<This woman's body has a crumpled note beneath it.>"
"165399380-0-20148";"Please show mercy to Vahara. She wields no weapons, nor does she harbor ill thoughts against you."
"165399380-0-20154";"What's this? \n\nThis is my father's shield. Where'd you get this?"
"165399380-0-20155";"Speak to Captain Diiril if you need something."
"165399380-0-20156";"Why won't Mournhold send reinforcements? This pass leads straight to the city."
"165399380-0-20157";"The Gorge is closed. If you're going to Mournhold, find a different way."
"165399380-0-20158";"You're here to make a deal, right?\n\nWe show you the Dominion's treasure ship, you take their prize, and we all stay alive. Much better than the alternative!"
"165399380-0-20180";"We're a peaceful order, but right now I could easily knock a few Vereansu heads together!\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, these people need my healing skills. Healer Senar can tell you more."
"165399380-0-20181";"Please, not now. The Vereansu drove us from the village and I must attend to the ill."
"165399380-0-20182";"<A broken Dwarven construct near a major road? Unusual, to say the least.>"
"165399380-0-20183";"<<1>> would have me believe you single-handedly rid this … port of Dominion meddling. I would be dubious, but <<2>> corroborated her story.\n\nNow we don't need to fight a war with these pirates. We have you to thank for that."
"165399380-0-20185";"Hmm. I see cunning in your eyes and smell blood on your weapon. But if you're a Vereansu, I'm a bloated netch.\n\nWhat brings you to Muth Gnaar?"
"165399380-0-20186";"Dolril came out of nowhere and saved me. I owe him my life!"
"165399380-0-20202";"Ha, what a sight! Ulawa thinks he's the best of the barrel, I suppose.\n\nA couple of rounds of cards and I'll win myself those pants right off him!"
"165399380-0-20203";"What business brings you here?"
"165399380-0-20214";"My family! We're free! We're finally free."
"165399380-0-20217";"Who would take the relics? Their only value is historic!"
"165399380-0-20223";"There's war, and then there's just slaughter. \n\nThe Maulborn fight without honor. I don't expect we'll be taking any prisoners."
"165399380-0-20224";"Don't tell the stable master, but I can't stand the smell of guar."
"165399380-0-20225";"My family runs a stable in Windhelm. It's much nicer than this place."
"165399380-0-20226";"As soon as we finish repairs and fill the cart, we're heading back to Eastmarch."
"165399380-0-20227";"You're still alive. Good! After I found poor Kanat, I wasn't sure. \n\nWe've got some help from Narsis. Things are looking up."
"165399380-0-20239";"I can't believe someone would steal from the Root Stewards. It's unthinkable."
"165399380-0-20240";"I can feel the wind at my back, like a caress. It's very peaceful, but you're interrupting its flow. Why?"
"165399380-0-20241";"I heard a songbird yesterday. Today, it's gone. Nothing is permanent, even beauty. Perhaps it is the same with our relics."
"165399380-0-20247";"Kaoc! Do you make a habit of barging into houses?"
"165399380-0-20248";"I sense changes coming to our Vale, and we may have no say in the matter."
"165399380-0-20252";"Ready for a fight? Once the archers start shooting, the Maulborn will swarm this overlook.\n\nLet me know when you're ready."
"165399380-0-20261";"Where could they be? The pilgrims were supposed to arrive hours ago."
"165399380-0-20262";"<This pilgrim's clothing is torn, but unstained.>"
"165399380-0-20263";"<This pilgrim's body is cold to the touch.>"
"165399380-0-20264";"I need your help! They captured <<1>>!"
"165399380-0-20265";"Change of plans! Those crates the archers destroyed? The plague is spreading quicker than Dragon's breath. Can't go that way."
"165399380-0-20266";"I warned that fool Diiril not to go on ahead.\n\nIf he's not a husk yet, he's probably a feast for one. That plague moves like lightning."
"165399380-0-20270";"A stranger to Stillrise? You have some surprises in store for you here. If you have not spoken to <<1>>, you should."
"165399380-0-20272";"Greetings, stranger. Visitors to Stillrise Village are rare. Have you spoken to our chief? His dwelling is at the top of the hill."
"165399380-0-20297";"Quick, untie me before they come back and put my soul into that horrid purple rock!"
"165399380-0-20303";"We only sought to help the afflicted."
"165399380-0-20305";"I can't get out. I don't want to die."
"165399380-0-20313";"Please leave me be. I must focus on the sick."
"165399380-0-20315";"Stop, traveler, and listen.\n\nI'll be brief. Try to keep up with me."
"165399380-0-20326";"My wife got away, but I'm trapped. I'll never see her again."
"165399380-0-20327";"My whole family, dead. I'll never get out of here alive."
"165399380-0-20349";"You are trespassing in the Kingdom of Zuuk. Depart immediately."
"165399380-0-20356";"Qa'jhirr, at your service."
"165399380-0-20357";"I'm sorry. I don't believe I know you."
"165399380-0-20373";"Events like these are gifts from Vivec. Peril keeps the mind sharp and the eye keen."
"165399380-0-20374";"What a horrible fate to befall these people."
"165399380-0-20375";"The curate insists I treat this heretic like an ambassador. I don't know why. Those are her people outside screaming for our blood.\n\nI'd rather cut her head off and kick it over the wall to her barbarian kin. That would send a message."
"165399380-0-20377";"Did you recover any medallions? I hope so. \n\nI don't know what I was thinking—that I could just go out there and find them all by myself."
"165399380-0-20386";"It may be a ruin in a swamp, but this town has resources perfect for the Fighter's Guild."
"165399380-0-20393";"Sundries to sell, or buy! My inventory runs low, so if you have what I need, I'll pay well."
"165399380-0-20394";"Cheap prices here! No returns, no questions asked!"
"165399380-0-20395";"Without a proper laboratory, we can't continue our research.\n\nWith luck, Stormhold will send us supplies; otherwise, we're wasting our time here."
"165399380-0-20396";"And how can this humble servant aid you, muthsera?"
"165399380-0-20397";"Looking for action? You've come to the right place."
"165399380-0-20398";"Best not to swim in the swampwater. Why not take a boat instead?"
"165399380-0-20400";"Here to hone your skills with the blade, eh? Welcome to Hissmir."
"165399380-0-20402";"Some dismiss the swamp. Me, I see it as a trove of ancient lore!"
"165399380-0-20403";"Mud. Flies. Lizards. And not a single decent tavern. How was I supposed to know that cat was the Archmage's familiar?"
"165399380-0-20418";"<<1>> is waiting for you on the docks. She has some important news for you.\n\nI'll get this back to <<2>> and <<1>>, after setting aside a cut for you and your crew. Don't worry. I excel at counting coins."
"165399380-0-20422";"My friend, you have no idea how good it is to be free again."
"165399380-0-20428";"It's been a pleasure having you work for me. As long as I'm boss of this town, you're welcome in <<1>>."
"165399380-0-20431";"A stranger to Stillrise? You have some surprises in store for you here.\n\nIf you have not spoken to <<1>>, you should."
"165399380-0-20432";"Greetings, stranger. Visitors to Stillrise Village are rare. Have you spoken to our chief? His dwelling is at the center of town."
"165399380-0-20433";"I know this will sound atypical, but are you willing to risk heresy?"
"165399380-0-20435";"I've heard enough complaints about the Dominion soldier here. Please don't provide me with another."
"165399380-0-20436";"If you're here to complain about the Dominion soldier's presence, I've already heard every complaint you can imagine."
"165399380-0-20446";"Tread lightly. The swamps are an unforgiving teacher."
"165399380-0-20455";"""My love, you cannot know how lonel—""\n\nOh, I didn't see you. How embarrassing. Don't mind me."
"165399380-0-20457";"Keep your head down. The invaders in Percolating Mire are indiscriminate in their killing."
"165399380-0-20460";"We've got the raiders on the run! \n\nDidn't hurt that their machines turned against them."
"165399380-0-20469";"You don't need healer training, they said. You're a trader, they said. No one ever gets hurt on a caravan. Hmmph."
"165399380-0-20470";"Say, I'm good at this. Maybe I will become a healer."
"165399380-0-20473";"Excuse me. I'm busy."
"165399380-0-20475";"Fruitful travels to you, wanderer.\n\nHave you one to remember in our marshes?"
"165399380-0-20476";"This is no place for the living, not anymore. If you're here to honor lost friends, you should come back next season.\n\nMaybe things will be better by then."
"165399380-0-20482";"You've returned. And you have the amulet! My mother will take it as a sign."
"165399380-0-20492";"Leave me to my grief."
"165399380-0-20493";"<Tiril glares at you.>"
"165399380-0-20494";"I grieve. Dominion soldiers destroyed my home. \n\nWithout help from the Shadowscales, I wouldn't have escaped."
"165399380-0-20495";"Is it done? Is it killed?"
"165399380-0-20497";"Hold! Who are you?"
"165399380-0-20498";"Walk softly, friend. Worm Cult necromancers infest these swamps."
"165399380-0-20499";"Keep still, or the Worm Cult will spot you! What are you doing here?"
"165399380-0-20501";"Can I help you find something to sate your appetite? We have many delicacies here, from all over Skyrim and Morrowind."
"165399380-0-20502";"And you interrupt me for what? I've half a mind to throw my mug, except that'd be a good waste of ale."
"165399380-0-20503";"Victory requires strength, courage, a good weapon, and a great teacher. Hope you are prepared!"
"165399380-0-20505";"Yes, I am new to … swordplay. But I have known the fine edge of blades since I was hatched. Shall I show you my wares?"
"165399380-0-20506";"There's nothing better than fresh meat, but you can't be picky on the trail. I can show you how to keep it tasty for months!"
"165399380-0-20507";"Truly talented. And in more than the arts, let me tell you. But quite out of your league.\n\nI see you making anything but friendly conversation with Attiri, it'll be the last words your tongue says."
"165399380-0-20508";"Dung-for-brains over here hardly knows the business end of a weapon. If he's going to watch our stock, he needs to learn to use it as well.\n\nNow, what can I help you with?"
"165399380-0-20510";"Experiments don't have to be boring. But they frequently aren't delicious."
"165399380-0-20511";"To augment what was once plain is as close to divine as any of us will see. Shall I show you my craft?"
"165399380-0-20512";"Welcome to Stormhold's forge, friend. Keep back from the fire, and we'll get along fine."
"165399380-0-20513";"I have a little bit of this and a little bit of that. All those little things can be yours to drink."
"165399380-0-20514";"You won't find better armor anywhere, friend."
"165399380-0-20515";"I earn my bread in steps and song. But if you're buying a round, I won't turn it down."
"165399380-0-20516";"See anything that catches your eye?\n\nDon't be shy. Everything's negotiable."
"165399380-0-20517";"If I can't make what you need, then you probably don't need it at all."
"165399380-0-20518";"Heavy armor is a greater burden on your assailant than on you."
"165399380-0-20519";"Your backpack is poorly made. Also, it's too small.\n\nYou want all your provisions to fall out? No? Buy one of my packs!"
"165399380-0-20520";"Your riches will be well looked after. I swear on my mother's egg-tooth."
"165399380-0-20522";"I worry about Gethis. He insists on working after his wife's murder, but it weighs on him."
"165399380-0-20541";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-20542";"A traveler! Welcome. Rest at our hearth as long as you wish.\n\nShall I prepare you some food and drink?"
"165399380-0-20565";"Getting here was not easy. My scales are scuffed and cracked from the climb."
"165399380-0-20567";"The Scamps do not know fear.\n\nTroll's blood, I've tried to teach them."
"165399380-0-20581";"I want to wake up. I want this to be a dream.\n\nYesterday life was good. My Tiril was alive. What happened?"
"165399380-0-20617";"Visitors to Stillrise Village are rare. Have you spoken to our chief? His dwelling is atop that hill."
"165399380-0-20653";"You there!  You look like someone who can handle a… troublesome situation."
"165399380-0-20654";"Greetings Traveller. I have need of you! Are you prepared to join the glorious ranks of the many brave souls that have come before you to go out to do my bidding?"
"165399380-0-20655";"I gottah have them shards, <<1>>!!"
"165399380-0-20656";"How can I be a noble without my expensive crystal?"
"165399380-0-20657";"Can you help a fella out?"
"165399380-0-20659";"The Supernal Dreamers! They stole my Crystal of Power!"
"165399380-0-20661";"Ah, you've come—and just in time. Vox has summoned Daedric cultists to make up for the Maulborn losses.\n\nMother Morrowind ordered us to wait for the one who brings the blessing of Veloth to arrive."
"165399380-0-20683";"I follow your lead, my friend."
"165399380-0-20695";"You look brave and wise. What is your name?"
"165399380-0-20697";"My father, Tanval Indoril, commands here. Speak with him."
"165399380-0-20707";"If you've got business, then let's get on with it. I've got to catalogue a slew of broken hilts before the next fortnight."
"165399380-0-20708";"A symbol is nothing without fine men and women behind it. That is what I build, in these old ruins. The backbone of the Fighters Guild."
"165399380-0-20709";"Stormhold is ill-equipped for the kind of experiments I'd like to perform, but the sheer number of artifacts buried here makes up for it."
"165399380-0-20710";"When you're as old as I am, you don't care if anyone agrees with you or not.\n\nMakes research much more enjoyable."
"165399380-0-20720";"If you want to work on your technique, you can't be afraid to get burned. Come closer and I will show you."
"165399380-0-20722";"What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-20728";"<<1>> has seen much suffering, but we survive. We always survive."
"165399380-0-20729";"These Covenant soldiers are not lions. They are insects."
"165399380-0-20731";"The Worm Cultists tore up my hut looking for the <<1>>.\n\nMiserable toad-lickers."
"165399380-0-20746";"We are allowing no one to approach the Hist, especially strangers claiming they wish to help us.\n\nWe just caught a Dark Elf trying to poison the tree."
"165399380-0-20749";"Hail, citizen. What seems to be the trouble?"
"165399380-0-20754";"I think I'm stuck."
"165399380-0-20755";"Halp, <<1>>!!"
"165399380-0-20756";"Thank the Eight, you aren't one of these Supernal Dreamers."
"165399380-0-20759";"Thank the Eight you are here!"
"165399380-0-20761";"Please! Can you get me out of here?"
"165399380-0-20764";"Greetings, stranger. Visitors to Stillrise Village are rare. Have you spoken to our chief? Her dwelling is at the center of town."
"165399380-0-20765";"A stranger to Stillrise? You have some surprises in store for you here. If you have not spoken to <<1>>, you should."
"165399380-0-20770";"You've done a fine job here. Drathus told me all about it while you were in there. \n\nThat may have been why we were late. But you won anyway, eh?"
"165399380-0-20774";"Halp, <<1>>!!"
"165399380-0-20775";"I should probably give up gambling."
"165399380-0-20776";"I'm not captive anymore! And I'm still rich!"
"165399380-0-20781";"Alexandra stands now inside the coral. She has stolen its heart, and it dies a slow death. We are joined, and I feel its pain as I feel my own."
"165399380-0-20786";"You made it out!"
"165399380-0-20787";"Step quietly traveler. There's a mountain of an Orc nearby."
"165399380-0-20791";"You've done a fine job here."
"165399380-0-20803";"Mourn for me, or they'll suspect I'm alive."
"165399380-0-20817";"Tanval's Vanguard pushed us out of the city. I don't know how we'll get them out of there. The grandmaster bends to their every whim."
"165399380-0-20818";"Out safely, I see. Thanks again for your timely aid."
"165399380-0-20832";"Did the reinforcements from Fort Virak make it to the village?"
"165399380-0-20854";"I am a merchant full of goodies."
"165399380-0-20915";"I came to pay my respects to our beloved sovereign, but it seems his body has already been taken south to Bangkorai Garrison. \n\nNo doubt it's safer there."
"165399380-0-20917";"Have you come looking for a steed, friend? Fallen knights mean riderless horses! Misfortune for them means savings for you! Have a look at my stock."
"165399380-0-20945";"You don't look much like a smith … too clean, says I. \n\nIf you want to get your hands dirty, have a look at my materials. They may cost a bit more than most, but quality like this don't come cheap."
"165399380-0-20960";"If it's a drink you want, speak with Mortine. I've got my hands full."
"165399380-0-20984";"Welcome to Evermore. Can I interest you in a fine riding beast?"
"165399380-0-21022";"These filthy pirates want to sell us all into slavery. Please, find a way to save us!"
"165399380-0-21056";"I'm lost. Horribly, horribly lost.\n\nThen again, if you're here, I'm sure you're lost, too."
"165399380-0-21071";"More soldiers coming? You know what that means. More mouths to feed."
"165399380-0-21072";"These soldiers seem nervous. They want to end this fight and move on, but for some reason, the general has them waiting for reinforcements.\n\nOf course, I don't mind staying for a few more days. I hate packing."
"165399380-0-21074";"I thought we would be moving on by now, but the general wants us to put up more walls.\n\nMaybe he's planning something more elaborate. I wouldn't know."
"165399380-0-21085";"It has been a long time since I've made a sale."
"165399380-0-21090";"Don't know why I even bother fishing. These damn crows snatch the blasted thing right off the line before you can pull it ashore."
"165399380-0-21111";"At last! Someone who can appreciate my wares!"
"165399380-0-21113";"What? You just walk up and start talking to everyone you see? Maybe I want to be left alone.\n\nPox! There's a patrol. Just pretend like you're talking to yourself."
"165399380-0-21114";"Stop! Stay away!"
"165399380-0-21124";"I hope you're not headed for Deepcrag Den."
"165399380-0-21126";"Quiet! I think I hear something!"
"165399380-0-21135";"Greetings! Have you heard of the once-great Volek family? I'm the last of my line."
"165399380-0-21136";"Over here! You have the look of someone who deals in gold and blood."
"165399380-0-21137";"I pray that you will help us, land-strider."
"165399380-0-21143";"Enjoy the gratitude of Sen Dres."
"165399380-0-21144";"We don't get a lot of call for horses, the swamps being what they are. But I'm here to supply the Vicecanons if they need my services."
"165399380-0-21148";"Never clean. Never clean enough."
"165399380-0-21151";"I've been in port a week. If you can even call this a port."
"165399380-0-21152";"When you've sailed for as far and as long as I have, the swamps don't bother you much. It's the people that get to me."
"165399380-0-21154";"Don't mind me. I'm traveling with these folks because they're paying for my drinks."
"165399380-0-21158";"I don't trust the Shadowscales. Sure, they're on our side. But they're secretive, unaccountable, and all they know how to do is kill."
"165399380-0-21163";"The Dark Elves of Kragenmoor are a tough audience. They do not dip their tails in the River of Humor."
"165399380-0-21165";"<<1>> was a kind woman. She tended eggs, you understand? She was a midwife to Argonian hatchlings.\n\nAnd they butchered her. The Dominion cut her down and left her to rot."
"165399380-0-21169";"My scales are dry with disappointment."
"165399380-0-21172";"Before the Three, as is my right and my duty, I greet you as the eldest of the Brothers Randoro."
"165399380-0-21173";"Own no weakness or fault. I greet you as one of the performing Brothers Randoro."
"165399380-0-21174";"Justice does not know sleep, and the honor of your house is yours alone. I greet you as the youngest of the Brothers Randoro."
"165399380-0-21175";"Welcome to Lukiul Uxith. If you're here to slaughter Covenant soldiers, you should hurry before they're all dead."
"165399380-0-21176";"Not so loud. You'll betray our position."
"165399380-0-21179";"Please. Our swamp is being corrupted. I need help to prepare, so I can stave off our destruction."
"165399380-0-21188";"What is it you wish, child?"
"165399380-0-21189";"If we had an army of heroes like you, we'd never lose a battle."
"165399380-0-21190";"I owe you a drink, partly for saving us, but mostly for proving that Aanthis was wrong."
"165399380-0-21191";"Thank you for saving us—especially my friend, Meejapa.\n\nI'm glad he's alive. I just wish he'd shut up."
"165399380-0-21192";"You there! What is your name?"
"165399380-0-21197";"Thanks for meeting me here. I'm glad I don't have to face this alone."
"165399380-0-21203";"Waxhuthi! It hurts."
"165399380-0-21216";"If you're another Dominion retainer come to mock our hatching ritual, we won't stop you. Not that we have a choice."
"165399380-0-21220";"I'm sorry. I don't believe I know you."
"165399380-0-21237";"This is a disaster! Some scavengers are lost in the mire and I can't spare anyone to go look for them.\n\nAny chance you can help me?"
"165399380-0-21243";"Tear this room apart if you have to.\n\nThere has to be something here that can help us against the plague."
"165399380-0-21274";"<Belronen Telvanni's corpse remains where it fell in the duel. The only wound he bears is a tiny cut on his arm.>\n\n<There is a crumpled note tucked into his belt.>"
"165399380-0-21276";"Fenila lent Belronen her blade before the duel. I insisted Vamen and Belronen swap weapons.\n\nYou'd think she was Ash Mountain, the way she fumed."
"165399380-0-21278";"Lord Vivec, I was here when Belronen issued his challenge. He would still live if not for Fenila! She stoked the Telvanni's rage, urging him not to back away from an insult to his honor.\n\nShe called herself his friend. Curious way to show it."
"165399380-0-21288";"Get ready. The lizards should arrive at any moment."
"165399380-0-21291";"The swamp's gone mad. We sure could use some help."
"165399380-0-21341";"Ah, it's you! Good. We need someone here who can get things done."
"165399380-0-21346";"With the death of the alchemist Merdyndril, our contract is fulfilled. \n\nI'm not sure we could have accomplished it without you."
"165399380-0-21347";"You're full of surprises. Not that I doubted you.\n\nThanks for your help."
"165399380-0-21348";"Well. Looks like both of us survived."

"165399380-0-21355";"Silent Mire used to be a busy place. Now I think I should find a new location to set up shop."
"165399380-0-21356";"The mire provides to me, and I provide to you."
"165399380-0-21357";"Oh? Would you like to shovel hot coals for a while? Be my guest."
"165399380-0-21358";"You've found the Mournhold crafters' circle. What're you looking for?"
"165399380-0-21359";"Welcome to the crafters' circle. Feel free to look around."
"165399380-0-21360";"I can't believe so much of my stock survived that ordeal. My wares're in fine condition. See for yourself."
"165399380-0-21384";"The kwama went crazy! It wasn't supposed to be like that!"
"165399380-0-21401";"Quiet or they'll notice us!"
"165399380-0-21402";"What? Oh, I thought you were one of the Ashlanders.\n\nI don't know if I can do this."
"165399380-0-21409";"Finally, the Voleks have paid for their crimes. Thanks to you."
"165399380-0-21413";"The Voleks have all been slain, but Eyes-that-Glint is still dead. \n\nWe are as bad as the Voleks."
"165399380-0-21421";"Father! Oh, Father! Why did this happen to you?"
"165399380-0-21424";"I was so not ready for this. Tribunal save us!"
"165399380-0-21425";"I hope you drank one of Edrasa's potions. Otherwise, this is going to be a short visit."
"165399380-0-21426";"These bindings are an indignity. Uncomfortable, too.\n\nYou, there. Untie me."
"165399380-0-21427";"Please, I can't get out. I don't want to die."
"165399380-0-21428";"My wife escaped, but I'll never see her again."
"165399380-0-21429";"You have to help me. My son died before my eyes. What do I do?"
"165399380-0-21430";"My whole family. Dead. I'll never leave here alive."
"165399380-0-21436";"Hail! I am Rigurt the Brash. I lead our Glorious Expedition for Nord Cultural Exchange to the Dark Elves.\n\nExcuse please, Dunmer. The proper term for puny ones is Dunmer. Small, I mean. Not puny."
"165399380-0-21437";"The imps attacked as I was passing through Deleyn's Mill. Now my wagon is damaged and I'm stuck out here. Perhaps the kind stranger would care to buy something before everything spoils?"

"165399380-0-21441";"Welcome to Shad Astula. I maintain the school's collection of manuscripts and books."
"165399380-0-21452";"Who are you that shatters Vox's wards and defies her will? Why hasn't she consumed your soul, as she has with all the others? How very interesting."
"165399380-0-21455";"Without your help, I would have been food for baby spiders."
"165399380-0-21481";"Please get me out of here! Do whatever she says.\n\nYou can't imagine the indignities she's promised me if you fail."
"165399380-0-21482";"You dare trespass in the Kingdom of Zuuk? Begone!"
"165399380-0-21496";"The prisoner's in the tower. Up the path and enter the tower on your left."
"165399380-0-21515";"Why do you intrude in the Kingdom of Zuuk? Be on your way!"
"165399380-0-21529";"I still feel the Fang of Sithis clacking at me.\n\nGet it away from me, quickly!"
"165399380-0-21539";"Well met. I'm studying the ruins throughout Shadowfen.\n\nShould you find anything significant, please bring it to me."
"165399380-0-21540";"We're all doomed. Almalexia save us!"
"165399380-0-21542";"My masters do not want this one to speak in public."
"165399380-0-21543";"Your Ebonheart Pact must be so proud. Everyone is free, except those of us who serve House Dres."
"165399380-0-21545";"Have you come to hear my daughter Ophalia's music? She's performed in some of the Pact's largest cities."
"165399380-0-21552";"Clothing, fine raiment here, the finest in Mournhold."
"165399380-0-21568";"Another mortal seeking power! I will be amused to see yet another destroyed.\n\nWait … your scent is different! Perhaps you can wield the will of the ancients and survive their price."
"165399380-0-21569";"Please, traveler. Our swamp is being corrupted. I need help to prepare, so I can stave off its destruction."
"165399380-0-21575";"Welcome back, Deputy Envoy! Did you have luck making our cultural exchanges? We're still waiting to hear from the damn registrar."
"165399380-0-21606";"Things are in some disarray here at the monastery. Did you need something important?"
"165399380-0-21615";"Who are you that shatters Vox's wards and defies her will? Why hasn't she consumed your soul, as she has with all the others?\n\nAh. No soul. How very interesting."
"165399380-0-21629";"Make haste or soon I will be no more."
"165399380-0-21630";"I heard Ruvali scream. When it came from below, I took a few swings at it, but we can't kill this thing unless it's in a body."
"165399380-0-21632";"The son listened when cunning Boethiah whispered in his ear. He tried to steal an artifact from the Tribunal Temple—the hammer known as the Judgment of Veloth.\n\nMany of the Tribunal's faithful died gloriously that day!"
"165399380-0-21633";"I don't see this thing. Ruvali said you chased it down here."
"165399380-0-21634";"He hasn't said anything. He hasn't moved. He's just watching."
"165399380-0-21656";"I don't recommend going into <<1>>, if that's where you're headed."
"165399380-0-21657";"This place is crawling with wasps. Feels like home."
"165399380-0-21671";"The Dremora may be tough, but they're not that smart. How dare they invade our shrine!"
"165399380-0-21676";"Turn back, traveler. There was an explosion and now Selfora is overrun. I was injured trying to get to the inn."
"165399380-0-21683";"Please, you must help the woman! I beg you!"
"165399380-0-21699";"I'm sorry. I don't believe I know you."
"165399380-0-21700";"Tirinaat told me what happened at the temple. You stand alone, so I must ask: how did our Ashkhan face his death?"
"165399380-0-21707";"Poor Vox, mad with grief, vowed revenge upon the Three. Beautiful Boethia whispered in the mother's ear, revealing that faith isn't as strong as the bond between a mother and her child.\n\nVox had been wronged. She had been pushed too far."
"165399380-0-21729";"Welcome back to the fight, my friend.\n\nThis mountain's been rumbling for hours, and we're stuck out here, blades in our hands and no one to stab."
"165399380-0-21732";"The storm rages, but here I am, out of the rain.\n\nHow goes the battle, my friend?"
"165399380-0-21733";"My friend. I see you've come to stop me. Thank Vivec you're here."
"165399380-0-21734";"With the final ward down, the way is clear. \n\nFortunately, Walks-in-Ash has restored some measure of my strength."
"165399380-0-21747";"Thank you for rescuing Elynisi. I hope you can help us."
"165399380-0-21758";"Can't keep fighting. We need help. Our village … is under attack."
"165399380-0-21761";"I never thought I'd be so happy to get back in this inn."
"165399380-0-21762";"Need help. Our village is under attack. Defend it."
"165399380-0-21767";"Impressive! Her memory detected your presence! Look how her power grows!\n\nYour time is running out. This is so exciting! I think you'll have only one chance to stop her."
"165399380-0-21786";"There's nothing here but withered roots and dead earth, but it's too soon for Tanval to join the dust. He still has a part to play."
"165399380-0-21787";"Look at him, my friend. Garyn's death has ruined him.\n\nHistory won't remember him as a great general. They'll just remember him as this."
"165399380-0-21788";"You shattered my wards. You entered my Hollow in service to a false god.\n\nI'm impressed you made it this far. But your interference ends here!"
"165399380-0-21789";"We've already dispatched messengers to Kragenmoor. Shor's bones, I hope we don't need to evacuate Ebonheart."
"165399380-0-21793";"My gods have forsaken me, but you radiate divine favor.\n\nI sense power in you. Have you come to set us free?"
"165399380-0-21794";"The power in your hands is familiar, yet I cannot place it. It almost feels ….\n\nOh, what I would give to be able to feel anything. To feel the touch of wind on my face, my hand on another's."
"165399380-0-21795";"A visitor? Strange. Your hands. Your body. Solid. Whole. \n\nWhere did you come from?"
"165399380-0-21810";"Please … I must have peace if I am to complete this ritual."
"165399380-0-21813";"No time to wait around while some other House grabs this spot. House Hlaalu has coin to make!\n\nWe'll honor the fallen by doing what we know best. Filling our pockets with gold."
"165399380-0-21824";"Can I help you?"
"165399380-0-21831";"You bring chaos and destruction to our ordered afterlife. Why are you here?"
"165399380-0-21832";"What do you seek, mortal?"
"165399380-0-21838";"Return with the stone, or we have nothing more to discuss. Follow the magical steps we used to bind Sadal."
"165399380-0-21839";"You again?"
"165399380-0-21851";"Mortal! Come closer. I cannot harm you in my current state."
"165399380-0-21857";"My gods have forsaken me, but your gods favor you. \n\nI sense great strength in you."
"165399380-0-21859";"You've done it! At last! The power in your hands. It's Veloth's blessing, isn't it? \n\nI remember now. I was a priest at the shrine before the woman came. Vox. I will have my revenge!"
"165399380-0-21864";"You've done it! By the Three, you've done it!"
"165399380-0-21865";"I've never met anyone like you. I doubt I ever will again. You've saved us."
"165399380-0-21869";"It's as though the storm still blows, but I can see the sun on the horizon."
"165399380-0-21870";"We must reforge the links in Sadal's chains, or we'll all be ashes in his inferno."
"165399380-0-21878";"You saved the woman. You have my thanks."
"165399380-0-21880";"I spent three days haggling over treacle-sap and fermented fish sauce. And look how well that's worked out for me!\n\nThree curses on their house, those lizards."
"165399380-0-21893";"The Daedra. They drove me mad. And now they've done the same thing to Mother. \n\nIt can't go on. She must be stopped. Go. The Reservoir of Souls stands open. We'll join you on the other side."
"165399380-0-21902";"I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in this inn."
"165399380-0-21949";"You walked in our skin and wrought our judgment. You exposed the lie at the core of all truth.\n\nThis may be lost on you. It does not matter."
"165399380-0-21953";"How did you make it through the Daedra, stranger? \n\nWe're having a damned hard time just holding back the tide."

"165399380-0-21978";"I have shown you everything I can remember."
"165399380-0-21979";"We have to stop Vox here and now. This power is not hers to control."
"165399380-0-21980";"Dominion troops have been spotted in this area. Steer clear, if you've a mind to keep your head."
"165399380-0-21981";"The Tribunal will not stand for this. Even in death, life, whatever this is—I can't allow Vox to continue."
"165399380-0-21987";"Another visitor to <<1>>? This isn't exactly the main route."
"165399380-0-21988";"We won't last much longer. Every day, the cannibals get more desperate."
"165399380-0-21993";"Excuse me for not rising. I'm not as spry as the hatchling I once was.\n\nLook out there, outsider. What do you see? Sadness? What of the ones who can never find their way to this place of rest? What of the ones lost to us forever?"
"165399380-0-21994";"Hold the tower, he said. Keep the ferals in check, he said. If we ever get out of this awful place, I'm going to demand hazard pay."
"165399380-0-21996";"Am I cursed to watch the world go on without me?\n\nWere my crimes that great?"
"165399380-0-21998";"We're pushing them back! We'll keep them hammered. You get that next ward down!"
"165399380-0-21999";"Balreth is too powerful. Portals everywhere. We're doomed.\n\nWho are you? Where did you come from?"

"165399380-0-22003";"I knew someone would come. I never gave up hope."
"165399380-0-22004";"Your reason surpassed the arbiter's trap. In doing so, you revealed yourself to us.\n\nYou do not fully comprehend. Such is your imperfection."
"165399380-0-22005";"Thanks again, friend!"
"165399380-0-22006";"I knew I wasn't abandoned. The Three watch over you!"
"165399380-0-22013";"It's good to see you alive."

"165399380-0-22036";"It is good to have our city back. My steel has been sullied by the touch of Imperial dogs. Soon, we strike back!"
"165399380-0-22037";"The Imperials fled with their tails between their legs. They headed southeast, to some dig site. A Dwarven ruin. Dogs are probably going to make a fortune from their finds."

"165399380-0-22040";"News Imperial defeat is never bad news, my friend."

"165399380-0-22219";"Beware! This is a place of angry death."

"165399380-0-22383";"Welcome to the Fish Stink. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-22388";"Come here. Quietly, please."
"165399380-0-22394";"You did it. The Echo of Vox is defeated and the fires and spirits have dissipated."

"165399380-0-22425";"About time you got here! I've been dodging spiders for what seems like forever.\n\nWait, you're not Raynor."
"165399380-0-22426";"Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! I require your immediate assistance."
"165399380-0-22433";"You've done well, for a mortal."

"165399380-0-22531";"You'll have to wait with the rest if you're seeking passage, f'lah. I don't care if King Emeric himself is banging on the gates. These manifests need to be checked and filed before we embark."

"165399380-0-22602";"Hello, traveler! I am but a humble merchant searching for new markets for my fine goods."
"165399380-0-22612";"We can't survive much longer here. Every year, the cannibals are more desperate."
"165399380-0-22618";"They're going to turn me into one of the unliving. You've got to save me!"
"165399380-0-22619";"I don't want to die. Please!"
"165399380-0-22620";"I don't want to be a zombie! Save me!"
"165399380-0-22621";"They're going to turn us into zombies. You've got to help me!"
"165399380-0-22630";"All my bags are genuine Skyrim auroch hide.\n\nThere isn't one stitch from any of those weird critters around here."
"165399380-0-22633";"Forgive my wheezing. The road from Dhalmora is long and my stock is ample. I could have loaded my burden onto a Guar, but I can't bring myself to do it. They look too much like family."
"165399380-0-22634";"It's a bad time to visit Davon's Watch. The Daggers could come over the walls at any moment.\n\nYou should buy some of my father's armor. You won't find better in all of Stonefalls."
"165399380-0-22635";"You buying or just talking?"
"165399380-0-22636";"As far as you know, the leather in my boots isn't from anyone in my family.\n\nExcuse me. That's a joke."
"165399380-0-22640";"Welcome to Narvyn's Arcane Emporium. Glad you found us. And by us, I mean me. Because a mage needs no one. Just his mind and good equipment. And every mage knows the best equipment can be found at Narvyn's.\n\nAm I going too fast for you?"
"165399380-0-22642";"I do not like the Khajiit, but Bakkhara was at least one of us. Why she crept off to Valenwood's Elden Tree, I will never know."
"165399380-0-22643";"Why don't you grab a drink and join us?"
"165399380-0-22645";"Hello, stranger. Just talking about the giant rats around here. \n\nHectur, the owner, goes after them like he's a great hero. He thinks it makes him look brave."
"165399380-0-22646";"Greetings, stranger. Long journey?"
"165399380-0-22647";"Pardon me, I'm showing this scale sister around town before we take up blades for the Pact."
"165399380-0-22648";"Stupid Khajiit! It's no wonder we made slaves of them. Bakkhara is going to waste her gifts creeping around Valenwood."
"165399380-0-22653";"I've been beaten lower than a dock rat. What's it to you?"
"165399380-0-22655";"What took you so long? And who's your sparky new friend?"
"165399380-0-22661";"These fumes … I feel terrible."
"165399380-0-22662";"I don't feel very well .…"
"165399380-0-22675";"In all my years, I've never seen anything like this."
"165399380-0-22739";"Good timing. I think I almost have this contraption figured out. Did you get the parts?"
"165399380-0-22749";"Looking to shape some metal? I've got what you need."
"165399380-0-22752";"Were you successful in the mines?"
"165399380-0-22755";"They say their spirits are here, you know. The lost souls who can't return to the soil. They say that this Vox … she enslaves them to do as she pleases.\n\nDo you think that's true? Are they not truly free from life's burden?"
"165399380-0-22756";"We're safe. I would prefer not to do that again."
"165399380-0-22757";"Honor to you, my friend."
"165399380-0-22758";"My shield brother is gone. He died as well as anyone could.\n\nLet's return to Kragenmoor and drink to his memory."
"165399380-0-22766";"Meht, my mouse, is not feeling well. His last meal sits ill with him. I will stay with him until he gets better."
"165399380-0-22775";"Your pardon. I know you have urgent business, but I must entreat your aid."
"165399380-0-22777";"You have to help me. I watched my son die before my eyes. What do I do?"
"165399380-0-22779";"Do you need something, citizen?"
"165399380-0-22781";"My whole family. Dead. I'll never leave here alive."
"165399380-0-22784";"Did you harvest the kwama cuttle?"
"165399380-0-22792";"<The corpse of an Argonian female lies in the dirt. Even though her body is slashed and burned, she appears to be dressed in the accoutrements of a tree-minder.>"
"165399380-0-22798";"Raynor showed up right after you went inside. \n\nWe heard scary noises from behind the door. What was in there?"
"165399380-0-22799";"I appreciate the help you gave my sister, even if she is rash and impetuous. Was the control rod useful?"
"165399380-0-22809";"Comrade."
"165399380-0-22811";"Hello."
"165399380-0-22812";"Beware! This is a place of angry death."
"165399380-0-22813";"I should do my best to comfort this man. He's dying."
"165399380-0-22814";"I like the ambiance out here.\n\nThere's a quiet in the air. So pleasant compared to that screaming from below."
"165399380-0-22823";"Stretch your tail here in peace."
"165399380-0-22824";"Be welcome and wallow, soldier. We aid Mistress Reesa in her humble works."
"165399380-0-22834";"What are you doing here?\n\nNo matter. I have goods to trade. They're just trifles, except for that odd statue."
"165399380-0-22848";"What? What are you doing out here?"
"165399380-0-22850";"Three bless you! We're grateful for your help."
"165399380-0-22856";"For speed on the battlefield, light armor is the best choice!"
"165399380-0-22858";"Protection and speed—that's what my armor offers!"
"165399380-0-22859";"This one offers weapons to fit every hand!"
"165399380-0-22860";"My wares are small but powerful. Don't risk battle without their protection!"
"165399380-0-22861";"Light armor is for cowards who plan to run. Invest in heavy armor and you will never regret it."
"165399380-0-22863";"What a pleasant surprise! I didn't think you'd get out of that gorge alive, but I'm happy to have been wrong."
"165399380-0-22864";"Hmm. There's something about you."
"165399380-0-22865";"Those pirates are digging … and drinking. We can take advantage of that."
"165399380-0-22866";"You look like someone who appreciates armor that doesn't slow you down!"
"165399380-0-22867";"Why wear armor that won't stop a dagger or that will rust if it rains? Try my armor on for size!"
"165399380-0-22868";"My weapons will keep you alive out there, warrior!"
"165399380-0-22869";"Small items pack great power. My wares will make a believer out of you!"
"165399380-0-22870";"I sell the best protection available. Anything less will leave you dead on the battlefield!"
"165399380-0-22872";"You go into battle unprepared, expect to die. Equip yourself well, warrior."
"165399380-0-22873";"While heavy armor suits clods who plod around the battlefield, light armor is best for the nimble of foot and mind!"
"165399380-0-22874";"The wise choose both protection and speed, qualities in which my armor excels!"
"165399380-0-22875";"It's the little things that make the difference in battle, friend. See for yourself!"
"165399380-0-22876";"When some Elf is poking at you with his little sword, you'll be glad you bought good armor from me!"
"165399380-0-22893";"I suppose I must now see to the farm. \n\nIt won't ever be the same, you know."
"165399380-0-22898";"Three gods. One faith.\n\nI trust you have practiced your devotions for the day."
"165399380-0-22909";"I'm going to die and rot in this swampy grave. No hope.\n\nI can't even get a dry pair of socks! Can't a soul die in a dry pair of socks?"
"165399380-0-22934";"What? Give up my invitation? Never!"
"165399380-0-22935";"I'm glad you're with us on this."
"165399380-0-22937";"Those pirates aren't just digging. They're drinking, too. Good."
"165399380-0-22957";"What do you want? Do you have an invitation?\n\nNo invitation, no passage."
"165399380-0-22958";"Control. We must learn control."
"165399380-0-22959";"I can't wait to get to the Academy! I want to become an officer and help lead the Pact."
"165399380-0-22960";"The instructors think they'll be able to contain my innate power. Ha!"
"165399380-0-22962";"I may not look it, but I'm glad to see you."
"165399380-0-23029";"Tell me, how did your invitation arrive?\n\nIn the claws of a bird of prey? In the fist of a charmed giant? I got mine from a terrifying ghost!"
"165399380-0-23047";"I've never been this far from home. I can't believe I'm doing this."
"165399380-0-23048";"Just wait till I get over to that school and show them what I'm made of. They'll be amazed!\n\nWhat're you looking at, s'wit?"
"165399380-0-23049";"My father said I was the most amazing wizard he'd ever seen. \n\nThey'll probably make me class hortator."
"165399380-0-23052";"Hello again my sweet… wait a minute. You aren't my sweet at all! Where is Orana?"
"165399380-0-23053";"Oh great, my father is convincing strangers to do his dirty work now. He couldn't talk me out of it and neither will you."
"165399380-0-23054";"Hello stranger, forgive me for not offering more hospitality but my family is in something of a crisis right now."
"165399380-0-23116";"You must be invited to enter the Shad Astula Academy of Magic.\n\nYou don't seem the type. Still, I've known unassuming students who achieved great success."
"165399380-0-23131";"Welcome to Shad Astula, proud training ground for the next generation of House and Pact leaders.\n\nMay I see your invitation?"
"165399380-0-23144";"There must be a way to fix things."
"165399380-0-23205";"I expect my students to strive for excellence. I demand brilliance, determination, and eagerness to embrace the ineffable mysteries of our noble calling."
"165399380-0-23213";"You have a touch of the Hist about you. It's strange."
"165399380-0-23218";"You want something, featherless?"
"165399380-0-23227";"I knew you could do it. Well done!\n\nNow to business. Something threatens this Academy, but your presence here will save the day. I have seen it in a vision!"
"165399380-0-23229";"I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in this inn."
"165399380-0-23230";"Thank you for rescuing Elynisi. I hope you can help us."
"165399380-0-23231";"Thanks again, friend!"
"165399380-0-23232";"I knew the Three wouldn't abandon me!"
"165399380-0-23237";"Vivec guide your steps, soldier."
"165399380-0-23238";"Troll's blood! I was hoping you'd show up here."
"165399380-0-23239";"Welcome in the name of the Three. How do you like Ebonheart?"
"165399380-0-23241";"Sun on my scales! Welcome. You have seen my cousins in the Argonian quarter, I hope?"
"165399380-0-23246";"When you came around, it was a lucky day for Shadowfen"
"165399380-0-23247";"I can fetch you a beverage if you'd like. If you're looking to make a more … intimate request, you'll have to speak with one of our courtesans."
"165399380-0-23255";"Find the amulet, she said. Use the wand, she said. \n\nWhat if it sets things on fire? I could burn the whole Academy to the ground."
"165399380-0-23262";"Those Dominion dryskins are all safely dead, I trust."
"165399380-0-23267";"Hello, traveler. I'm Selfora's healer. Not that it means much now. \n\nThis disaster has left me short on supplies. All I've got left are bloody rags and soothing words."
"165399380-0-23327";"What do you want? Can't a man drink in peace?"
"165399380-0-23328";"What rubbish! Fish magic from a pond? Vivec's buttocks, what does that even mean?"
"165399380-0-23332";"Asked me to do one simple thing. Bring student-rats back to instruction hall. But Hadmar can't do anything right."
"165399380-0-23348";"You were unconscious for hours. At least it seemed like hours.\n\nHow do you feel? I was worried about you."
"165399380-0-23349";"This is terrible! The Academy's in danger, the Arch-Mage is missing, and I'm locked in here with you."
"165399380-0-23352";"The Dominion fought like starving kagouti to get to this place. The fleshflies will surely feast upon their bodies.\n\nPoor fleshflies."
"165399380-0-23355";"I remember you! You helped us save Deepcrag Den!"
"165399380-0-23357";"<The dead Argonian's wrists bear fresh shackle-scars. A sticky substance oozes out from beneath his body.>"
"165399380-0-23359";"Master send me to make sure you safe. \n\nYou smell all right. Look funny, though."
"165399380-0-23364";"Hail and such. Keeping the ash out of your eyes?\n\nYou know, you look like a smart one. Any interest in a business arrangement?"
"165399380-0-23366";"Mayhem? Make things go boom?"
"165399380-0-23367";"Hadmar's glad to see you. Arch-Mage said you'd be here soon. And here you are."
"165399380-0-23368";"Wait, where am I? Why are we up so high?\n\nThat blasted banekin! It could have warned me."
"165399380-0-23369";"About time you summoned me. I thought you'd leave me sitting in that cell forever."
"165399380-0-23371";"Destroy the Lens! Release the students from its spell."
"165399380-0-23373";"We were going to expand the plantation. Sell the useless Cats for some strong Bretons and Redguards."
"165399380-0-23380";"You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. \n\nI'm so glad you're all right."
"165399380-0-23386";"Good to see you up and around. \n\nI knew you'd be fine, but Lena wouldn't leave your side. You gave her a good scare."
"165399380-0-23396";"Once again my people need me, but I dwindle and fade."
"165399380-0-23400";"The Dominion will never make us flatten our spines."
"165399380-0-23413";"Beware! Daedra assail this humble shrine."
"165399380-0-23417";"I thought I was the only one fool enough to be sneaking around this place. Are you trying to get killed? Run for it while you can."
"165399380-0-23420";"Well done, friend. That hag had no business keeping me here. You did the right thing."
"165399380-0-23421";"It's not all bad. At least I get a feather bed, right?\n\nAsk my son to come up to the tower. I'd like him to meet his … er, new stepmother."
"165399380-0-23441";"Be welcome, my friend. We have few luxuries here, but we will trade with what we have."
"165399380-0-23455";"I hoped and prayed someone would come along."
"165399380-0-23457";"Why are you bothering me? Want to end up in the stocks?"
"165399380-0-23458";"While I've enjoyed finding treasures, it's probably time for me to seek a new direction."
"165399380-0-23473";"<This victim looks like he suffered many wounds. Sometimes exploration can have quite a cost.>"
"165399380-0-23478";"I've heard these mushrooms are delicious, but I'm not going to eat them. They glow like lanterns! That's not appropriate mushroom behavior! I disapprove."
"165399380-0-23483";"I'm giving up tomb excavation for good. I think I'll grow mushrooms."
"165399380-0-23485";"Not so loud! You'll betray our position!"
"165399380-0-23496";"I came all the way from Saint Veloth's Shrine to lend my skills to this effort."
"165399380-0-23503";"Welcome. Are you a scholar of the Mages Guild? \n\nWait, don't tell me."
"165399380-0-23504";"I can't talk. I have to concentrate on not being seen. If I can't see her, she can't see me!"
"165399380-0-23512";"No, another monster! I'd almost escaped. Don't hurt me!"
"165399380-0-23526";"Hush, fool. Do you want to give my position away?"
"165399380-0-23527";"Another fan of my music, eh? What brings you to Whiterun?"
"165399380-0-23528";"Welcome to Riften. I don't have time to be polite. We need help. If you're willing, I'll love you forever. If you're not, get out of my way."
"165399380-0-23529";"What brings you to White Rose, stranger? Did you take a wrong turn somewhere?"
"165399380-0-23530";"No, father, please. Don't beat me! I'll learn the song!"
"165399380-0-23531";"Mother, why don't you understand? I'm not some milk-drinking schoolgirl!"
"165399380-0-23534";"Dark winds flow through the woods these days."
"165399380-0-23537";"You'll not get a word out of me."
"165399380-0-23559";"Hello."
"165399380-0-23560";"I was afraid I was the only person here. I'm glad to see a friendly face."
"165399380-0-23561";"Alas, poor me.  Misfortune and ruin abound.  Excuse me, but do you think you could help?"
"165399380-0-23562";"Greetings, I could use some help with a troubling situation."
"165399380-0-23563";"You there! I've been robbed by Supernal Dreamers!"
"165399380-0-23564";"Oh, my poor antique crystals."
"165399380-0-23565";"Hail, greetings, and welcome! Are you friendly to those of my ilk?"
"165399380-0-23567";"<Cough> Can you help me?"
"165399380-0-23572";"What are you doing up here? It's too high for your kind! You have no wings. If you fall, you'll go ""splat!""\n\nI'd be sad to eat your tasty bits. Mostly."
"165399380-0-23574";"It's a shame that some of my kwama must be put down."
"165399380-0-23576";"What's this Daedric ruin doing here? What's its purpose? \n\nOh gods, is that blood coming out of my ear?"
"165399380-0-23578";"Come to join me in exile, featherless one?"
"165399380-0-23581";"You heading into that cave, too? The last one who went in there didn't come out."
"165399380-0-23583";"I am trapped and forgotten, like so many others."
"165399380-0-23584";"Hey, you! You're awake, yeah?"
"165399380-0-23585";"Hey, you! A minute to help an old man?"
"165399380-0-23589";"<Cough> Can you help me?"
"165399380-0-23592";"empty"
"165399380-0-23596";"I will take the prisoner to be questioned. Please speak with Dajaheel."
"165399380-0-23600";"Where? This body. This isn't my body!"
"165399380-0-23612";"It is an honor to work with <<1>>."
"165399380-0-23613";"Quick, you have to get me out of here before they come back. I'm next!"
"165399380-0-23614";"Please help me!"
"165399380-0-23615";"Quick, you have to get me out of here before they come back. I'm next!"
"165399380-0-23616";"Want do you want?"
"165399380-0-23617";"I'm so very tired of being kidnapped."
"165399380-0-23619";"Hi, I'm an escape artist with amnesia. Can you help me?"
"165399380-0-23620";"Quick, you have to get me out of here before they come back. I'm next!"
"165399380-0-23621";"Quick, you have to get me out of here before they come back. I'm next!"
"165399380-0-23623";"The swamp's blood boils with dark magic."
"165399380-0-23624";"The swamp has always had teeth. But those teeth now have venom."
"165399380-0-23638";"Want do you want?"
"165399380-0-23639";"Please, I must concentrate."
"165399380-0-23640";"Well, that was exciting. Let's never do it again."
"165399380-0-23641";"Thank you for freeing me!"
"165399380-0-23642";"What's that? Ha, made you look."
"165399380-0-23643";"Thank you for saving me from the Dreamers."
"165399380-0-23644";"Oh, there you are!"
"165399380-0-23645";"Thank you for freeing me! You rock!"
"165399380-0-23647";"We'll hold the line here. We can't let the rotgorges wash over the village like a poisonous wave."
"165399380-0-23648";"Rotgorges … stranglers … they used to be a nuisance. Now, they're proving deadly."
"165399380-0-23649";"I wasn't going to let you go away without saying goodbye."
"165399380-0-23650";"I know I gave you a hard time and all, but ….\n\nGah. I'm sorry. There, I said it."
"165399380-0-23651";"Hadmar's glad you're all right. I'm proud to call you my friend."
"165399380-0-23652";"Goblins are disgusting."
"165399380-0-23653";"I've never liked Goblins."
"165399380-0-23668";"It's good to see you again. If my prince would allow it, I'd show you just how grateful I am."
"165399380-0-23670";"What are you doing here? Turn back while you have the chance."
"165399380-0-23714";"That damn giant almost killed me. He did more damage than all the Reach combined."
"165399380-0-23720";"Sinmur was the most frightening thing I'd ever seen. It stepped on the soldier right next to me, squashed him flat!"
"165399380-0-23721";"I need to go somewhere far from this chaos. Maybe I'll try Riften."
"165399380-0-23727";"No time to talk. This barricade's gotta be built!"
"165399380-0-23728";"How much higher do we need to make these things?"
"165399380-0-23729";"Why don't some of these damn soldiers help out?"
"165399380-0-23730";"What hope is there that these barricades will hold?"
"165399380-0-23731";"The enemy is upon us. Be wary."
"165399380-0-23734";"Waiting for the next attack is the worst part for me."
"165399380-0-23735";"The Reach will regret the day they decided to tangle with us."
"165399380-0-23736";"Will the Reachmen ever go away?"
"165399380-0-23737";"All's well that ends well. Or as well as it's going to get, anyway.\n\nI'm glad to see you're still in one piece."
"165399380-0-23739";"This is just the beginning. Sinmur will destroy the Rift if he's not stopped."
"165399380-0-23740";"What good are barricades against a monster like that?"
"165399380-0-23741";"You're here to help against those savage bastards, yeah? You deserve a drink."
"165399380-0-23742";"I need a rest. I haven't slept since the Reach's first attack."
"165399380-0-23743";"The Reachmen will break against Shor's Stone walls if they dare to attack again."
"165399380-0-23744";"They never saw it coming. I hope we can secure the town and recover the survivors."
"165399380-0-23745";"The Ordinators must be vigilant in our pursuit of preserving the peace for the Tribunal.\n\nSadly, we can't be everywhere at once. And so Magistrix Vox grows bolder every day."
"165399380-0-23746";"I have no idea how the Reach got here, but we have to drive them out."
"165399380-0-23750";"Maybe we should abandon Shor's Stone."
"165399380-0-23751";"We can use all the help we can get around here."
"165399380-0-23764";"You'll not get a word out of me."
"165399380-0-23773";"If we don't work, we don't eat. Company doesn't pay us for sitting outside the mine."
"165399380-0-23777";"I can keep busy here, but my brother Adon can't work with those Goblins running loose in the mine."
"165399380-0-23778";"You ask me, sweeping's better than mining … but I doubt I'll get paid as much."
"165399380-0-23779";"Might … might … might as well drink my troubles away!\n\nYou wanna use the well? I'm not going to!"
"165399380-0-23781";"So the Maulborn lied to everyone. I figured as much. This doesn't bode well for Narsis, though."
"165399380-0-23782";"Thragnar the Breaker. You've heard of me, of course."
"165399380-0-23798";"Those Reach dogs will think twice about messing with <<1>>!"
"165399380-0-23810";"I don't trust the Maulborn. Not one bit.\n\nAnd I bet they're behind the Serk situation. That wouldn't surprise me at all."
"165399380-0-23829";"The Reach forces were too much for us. I've never seen them in such numbers or working together."
"165399380-0-23844";"Thallik is pleased with my Reachmen for unleashing the giant, Sinmur. He has asked that you guard Vernim Wood while his priests perform rituals upon us."
"165399380-0-23845";"You see that thing? That's what's left of the Reachmen gathered at Vernim."
"165399380-0-23859";"I pray all is not lost."
"165399380-0-23877";"I save people!"
"165399380-0-23879";"Be careful, stranger! The farm isn't safe."
"165399380-0-23888";"You bear the implements of my thralls, yet skin and sinew drape your bones. \n\nYou're more than a wandering collection of ritual components. But what, precisely?"
"165399380-0-23933";"You've returned. With a number of dripping presents. Excellent work."
"165399380-0-23982";"We must hurry."
"165399380-0-24004";"This place is lost to time, wanderer. You could never understand its significance."
"165399380-0-24022";"I'm trying to grieve. Bother me later. And bring a bottle."
"165399380-0-24023";"These poor souls need our help."
"165399380-0-24030";"They came from the darkness."
"165399380-0-24037";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-24064";"You'll not get a word out of me."
"165399380-0-24066";"The Goblins deserve freedom as much as we do."
"165399380-0-24067";"I'll teach those Goblins what's good for them."
"165399380-0-24085";"I didn't think we were going to make it out of there … Dajaheel. Belron."
"165399380-0-24095";"Don't gawk, do something!"
"165399380-0-24114";"Too late. You've come too late."
"165399380-0-24145";"Baltis fired our cook, so you are going to have to cook anything yourself. Feel free to use the cooking pots on the fire."
"165399380-0-24154";"So much death. My students, my egg-siblings … none survived the Dominion's experiments. Now, the lamias take their bodies for food.\n\nPlease, help me recover their bodies so they can return to the Hist!"
"165399380-0-24155";"The Reach forces were too much for us. I've never seen them in such numbers or working together."
"165399380-0-24185";"<<1>> still mourns, but you've brought him hope. I thank you.\n\nIf you're leaving, I can show you a quicker way out."
"165399380-0-24223";"If I were alive these caves would be silent. No bothersome cultists, no damned Elves, I'd even squash the rats for good measure."
"165399380-0-24224";"I am doing what I can, but the weapons wielded by the Worm Cult have a cruel bite. \n\nWe should have been more careful. Considering what we came here to do, we should have known there would be danger."
"165399380-0-24258";"Beware … this is a place of angry death."
"165399380-0-24272";"Good to see you up and around. Figured you were crossing the bridge to Sovngarde for sure."
"165399380-0-24277";"You're the one Holsgar pulled out of the water.\n\nI'm glad you're up. I could use your help."
"165399380-0-24309";"Wondrous.\n\nYou touched <<A:1>>, yes? Then our minds join within the Hist itself."
"165399380-0-24316";"Can you use that weapon, friend? I need your help."
"165399380-0-24317";"Listen, stranger. My brother is missing."
"165399380-0-24318";"Mind yourself. There are bandits about."
"165399380-0-24319";"Butchered! Their blood poisons the ground. The work of those who serve, or those who forget their place?\n\nWe'll rend the swamps barren before they tear our roots from the earth!"
"165399380-0-24320";"Our thoughts turn against us. Who else would have the will but the flesh-walkers?\n\nIs it time for the Song of Sithis to bring the Void? Shall they taste fear, and then nothing?"
"165399380-0-24321";"We heard the wails, felt the trembling of roots. But what our brother says of the flesh-walkers, it cannot be!"
"165399380-0-24323";"What did you do?"
"165399380-0-24326";"Maggot. You dare summon me?"
"165399380-0-24327";"You're up. Good. Maybe you can help.\n\nI know our village is about to be attacked, but <<1>> won't listen to me. She's a fool!"
"165399380-0-24331";"Welcome back. The villagers you rallied are ready to move."
"165399380-0-24332";"Why have you summoned me?"
"165399380-0-24333";"You're not part of my expedition. Interesting. \n\nThis is no random chance. I believe you're the answer to our problem."
"165399380-0-24342";"Come to prove your courage? So did my brother. Now he's gone."
"165399380-0-24345";"N/A"
"165399380-0-24357";"Mudcrabs! Delicious creatures."
"165399380-0-24358";"Ho there. Feeling better?"
"165399380-0-24359";"We've got bigger trouble now."
"165399380-0-24360";"I failed in my mission."
"165399380-0-24361";"Ah, our mysterious guest. My husband Holsgar was the one who found you.\n\nIf you're looking to buy supplies, you've come to the right place."
"165399380-0-24362";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought for sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-24368";"I've got a lot of work to do. Sorry."
"165399380-0-24369";"That daughter of mine. You mark my words—she'll never amount to anything."
"165399380-0-24370";"Watch your feet. Don't want to end up with pig droppings on them shoes of yours."
"165399380-0-24386";"Don't talk to me. I'm a shrub."
"165399380-0-24387";"My husband, Geilund, went fishing yesterday morning. He never came home.\n\nI went looking for him this morning with my dog, and now my dog has wandered off!"
"165399380-0-24388";"<<1>> wants me to follow him."
"165399380-0-24408";"Ah, you're one of ours. Thought there might have been a survivor in the camp. Not that the lamia would leave any."
"165399380-0-24416";"The Dominion cut away my sight. They thought it would muzzle a Shadowscale? Ha!"
"165399380-0-24438";"The mud of war flows slowly into the lazy river, turning the clean water dark and bitter. The time has come to divert the stream."
"165399380-0-24439";"We plan. We plot. We send troops hither and yon. And with all of that, the balance of power never seems to shift one way or the other. It's maddening!"
"165399380-0-24440";"The best fighters use every weapon at their disposal. I combine arcane arts with martial weapons, and that works amazingly well for me."
"165399380-0-24441";"A mage requires more than study and practice to succeed. You must make every use of magic as natural as taking a breath. Only then will you be ready to experience the true essence of magicka."
"165399380-0-24442";"The storm of battle overwhelms all things. Be the storm."
"165399380-0-24443";"The Mages Guild always maintains an air of neutrality, but I really want to experience this Nord festival. I admit I find all the excitement rather exhilarating."
"165399380-0-24444";"A sharp blade solves more problems than it creates. At least that's been my experience."
"165399380-0-24445";"Your best friend is a good weapon. Treat it well and it will never fail you."
"165399380-0-24446";"This is my shadowy alcove. Go find your own."
"165399380-0-24447";"Too cold, too cold! Magrus scorch the day Tender-Paws decided to come to this frozen wasteland! Still, this one is here to help. You want to be trained, yes?"
"165399380-0-24448";"It's hard to be sneaky with you standing here talking to me. Is there something I can do for you?"
"165399380-0-24449";"The sword is but a tool. The true weapon in any battle is the body and the mind that wields it."
"165399380-0-24450";"The trees always tell a tale, provided you have the skill and patience to listen."
"165399380-0-24451";"Haunted forest? Rubbish, I say!"
"165399380-0-24452";"The forest teaches us so much, gives us so many things. I just love nature!"
"165399380-0-24453";"The rolling netch gathers no moss. Think about it."
"165399380-0-24454";"Have you met my sister, Gabbi? I never understand what she's talking about, but she always seems to make a certain amount of sense."
"165399380-0-24457";"Windhelm was desperately in need of alchemists, so we traveled a long way and here we are!"
"165399380-0-24458";"Any news, traveler? I long to hear something, anything, that doesn't involve Nords and mead and battle. \n\nAh, but I'm sure you're here for another matter. Our enchantments are the best in Skyrim. But the best will cost you, as I'm sure you are aware."
"165399380-0-24459";"I've come a long way to practice my craft and I've grown particularly fond of this city."
"165399380-0-24460";"Forge's no place for games. If you're here to work, get to it.\n\nI've got a few things if you're short on supplies—but let's make this quick. The metal's going cold."
"165399380-0-24461";"Feel free to make use of our anvil. It's right over there."
"165399380-0-24462";"The celebration has been good for business. Thanks to all the visitors, we've never been busier.\n\nHave a look around. Our goods are the best in the city. We charge a little more, but it's definitely worth it."
"165399380-0-24463";"You look light on your feet. No bulky metal plates for you, eh? \n\nI've got plenty of items that will help you craft some sturdy, lightweight armor. Just shout if you see anything you like."
"165399380-0-24464";"Hello, friend. Don't you love the smell of freshly cut wood? That's the smell of unlimited possibilities. \n\nWe sell the finest products in the land, but quality will cost you, so I hope you've a full purse!"
"165399380-0-24465";"Are my husband and his daft cousins having another one of their silly competitions? They never include me because I'm clearly the better merchant. Let me show you what I have."
"165399380-0-24466";"Hail, friend, and well met! Are you here for the celebration? In that case, what you're wearing just won't do. You need a new set of armor. May I show you something that matches your eyes?"
"165399380-0-24467";"My son, Galmar, is the battlemaster in the Fighters Guild. Me? I just sell them armor. Made right here in Windhelm at Coldheart's forge. Finest armor in all the land!"
"165399380-0-24468";"Welcome, traveler. Your armor looks a bit battered and beat up. I can replace it with genuine Nord-crafted plate mail. And the price is right."
"165399380-0-24469";"My deals may seem harsh, but I assure you my prices are fair. And no one carries more potent arcane equipment than I do. You have my word on that."
"165399380-0-24470";"I'm competing with my cousins. I plan to sell the most weapons by the end of the cycle and win the purse of gold. You can help me by making a purchase today."
"165399380-0-24471";"I sell the keenest blades in all the land. You look like someone who appreciates a fine blade. Feel free to take a closer look at my wares."
"165399380-0-24472";"I bet you need a new bag. Let me help organize your life with a larger backpack."
"165399380-0-24473";"A fool and his gold are soon parted, but you don't look foolish. We will keep your valuables safe and sound."
"165399380-0-24474";"Time is gold, and today I have a short supply of both. There's just so much to do! King Jorunn doesn't celebrate the tenth anniversary of his rule every day, you know. Do you need something?"
"165399380-0-24475";"Eh. Good to see you again, mate."
"165399380-0-24489";"What happened? Did … did you see those Covenant soldiers?"
"165399380-0-24499";"Where did you find him?"
"165399380-0-24504";"<<1>> wants me to follow him."
"165399380-0-24528";"<<1>> wants me to follow him."
"165399380-0-24535";"We made it. We have you to thank for that. \n\nMay Kyne always guide your steps, and may Shor always keep your soul."
"165399380-0-24536";"I loved Tillrani, I really did, but I'm not going to let Trynhild run out of here lusting for revenge.\n\nI forbid it!"
"165399380-0-24537";"I'm going to kill Covenant soldiers. They let you do that in the Pact army.\n\nIf I have to, I'll just buy an axe and start walking west."
"165399380-0-24538";"They're dead. Everybody's dead, Littrek. Everybody's dead."
"165399380-0-24550";"Watch yourself. There are bandits about."
"165399380-0-24594";"Too many. There were just too many of them."
"165399380-0-24595";"We wouldn't be here if you hadn't helped us. \n\nYou have our thanks."
"165399380-0-24596";"I just couldn't help it.\n\nI ran! I'm sorry."
"165399380-0-24598";"The soldiers chased me in here. I thought I might burn alive!"
"165399380-0-24599";"Here be bandits."
"165399380-0-24600";"Have you come to prove your bravery? So did my brother. Now he's gone."
"165399380-0-24601";"Tillrani told us to run. I thought of the water and all those calm days in the surf. What was I thinking?"
"165399380-0-24602";"The Daggerfall Covenant attacked the village and set fire to everything!"
"165399380-0-24603";"The Daggerfall Covenant attacked the village and set fire to everything!"
"165399380-0-24610";"Looks like a hard road to Davon's Watch."
"165399380-0-24637";"The soldiers are everywhere! Where's Tillrani? I thought I'd be safe with her!"
"165399380-0-24641";"I fear the flames. The heat is drying my scales from here.\n\nWe must escape down the river, so we can swim again another day."
"165399380-0-24642";"Good to see Vivec has kept you safe. We'll make it out of this.\n\nI trust Rana, and I trust myself. We'll make it out."
"165399380-0-24643";"Rolly, what happened? How could they do this?"
"165399380-0-24644";"The Covenant has made a mistake. I'm going to make them pay for what they've done today.\n\nThey'll regret the day they crossed me!"
"165399380-0-24645";"<Rexus whines sadly at the smell of smoke and stench of death.>"
"165399380-0-24647";"I wish I wasn't so weak. I'd grab a sword and run those bastards down!"
"165399380-0-24649";"We were reunited, and then all this happened. Damn them!"
"165399380-0-24691";"You're in luck, warrior. Whatever you need, I have it right here!"
"165399380-0-24705";"How clever of you to have found me. I carry the finest merchandise and offer the best prices you'll find anywhere!"
"165399380-0-24709";"Greetings, warrior! Peruse my wares, please. The best goods at the lowest prices in all of Cyrodiil!"
"165399380-0-24751";"Ah, a fellow traveler. This one is pleased to meet you. Hazari's wares are yours, if they please you."
"165399380-0-24752";"Hail, wayfarer. Stendarr guide you on the perilous roads of Cyrodiil. Mayhaps my wares would interest you?"
"165399380-0-24753";"Greetings. May your membranes always be moist. If you have need of any supplies, perhaps I can assist?"
"165399380-0-24766";"I thought Tillrani was always a bit paranoid. Today? Today I think she's right. We've got to get the civilians ready to move."
"165399380-0-24767";"All the stuff that was in there! We have to go back and get some. The evil baby man must be gone now, right?\n\nWow! Did you see that, and that other, and, and….\n\nAw, come on, Rolly!"
"165399380-0-24768";"I swear, if he goes back to that cave again, I'm going to punch him in the throat."
"165399380-0-24791";"We Nords love the wind and sea! From the docks here in Windhelm, our ships sail across the world. I know every vessel in port, where it's from and where it's going."
"165399380-0-24793";"I don't know. Tillrani did keep us all safe for years. But Rana is captain now. We should listen to her, right?"
"165399380-0-24796";"Is it true? There's going to be an evacuation?"
"165399380-0-24797";"We came as soon as we heard.\n\nI'm not the sort to skeeve out of a fight, but if Tillrani and Rana both agree, well, that says something."
"165399380-0-24799";"I can't believe this. First, bandits. Now the Covenant!\n\nI wish Dedring was here."
"165399380-0-24800";"We've got things for sale other than iron here, if you're interested."
"165399380-0-24817";"You're awake! When <<A:1>> took you and the vicecanon, I sent for troops to carry you away from <<2>>. The vicecanon can explain why you're on this ship.\n\nI prayed for Sithis to keep you from the void. Did you hear me, in your sleep? No matter."
"165399380-0-24818";"Please, vicecanon … ten more minutes of sleep."
"165399380-0-24843";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24845";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24846";"Lower Yorgrim is dying. We have nothing left to offer you. I suggest you look for somewhere safer to rest this night."
"165399380-0-24847";"If you seek sanctuary, you've come to the wrong place.\n\nThis is my war council and you have interrupted its proceedings."
"165399380-0-24848";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24849";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24853";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24854";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24856";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24857";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24858";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24859";"Hi, I'm a mood test dummy."
"165399380-0-24931";"You came. Thank you. \n\nWe're going to need all the help we can get."
"165399380-0-24959";"Are you heading to the shrine?"
"165399380-0-24960";"I thought the tale the traveling merchant told us was just a story.\n\nBut with all the chaos, it's hard to know what to believe anymore."
"165399380-0-24966";"I can't believe this is happening to me."
"165399380-0-24967";"Yes?"
"165399380-0-24969";"Come to Cyrodiil! See the world and grab some glory. Join the Pact in arms!"
"165399380-0-24979";"This one welcomes you to Eyevea! Flowing robes of the finest cloth await your beautiful eyes."
"165399380-0-24987";"My apologies, but these are dangerous times. I watched my soldiers turn into mindless slaves. I had to make sure your will was still your own."
"165399380-0-25008";"You made it. It's about time!"
"165399380-0-25009";"I have many fine goods, direct from Davon's Watch."
"165399380-0-25014";"A fever curse grips poor Droi. If we don't cure him soon, I fear he'll become one of the bewitched."
"165399380-0-25015";"Go away and leave me to my drink."
"165399380-0-25016";"So? Speak."
"165399380-0-25017";"They say the Daggers are coming. Just a few years ago it was, ""the Dark Elves are coming.""\n\nHrr. Either way, our children are too big to hide."
"165399380-0-25021";"After you helped our escape from Silaseli, Roselle and Oriane have been sending us out in scouting parties to find a new home. We have a future again, thanks to you."
"165399380-0-25034";"Why do you approach me? Do you want to end up like the rest of the bewitched? \n\nOr perhaps you believe Kyne will protect you?"
"165399380-0-25035";"I've got to get the meadery open again. I made a promise!"
"165399380-0-25036";"You fought on Bleakrock, yes?"
"165399380-0-25043";"If I hadn't taken a dagger in the ribs, I'd deal with these damn Stormfists myself!"
"165399380-0-25051";"The bees are too agitated! They must be calm to produce the most flavorful honey."
"165399380-0-25053";"Stupid Stormfists. Stupid Orcthane. What a mess they made!"
"165399380-0-25057";"Have you said your devotions to the Three today?"
"165399380-0-25076";"Kyne must be smiling. To think some refugees from an island could help win a battle like this!"
"165399380-0-25079";"The women here all hate me. No idea why. Maybe I should move to another town? I hear Cropsford is nice."
"165399380-0-25080";"The Covenant flooded the docks. We tried to surrender, but they didn't want prisoners. \n\nMany of us were gutted and thrown into the sea."
"165399380-0-25081";"I'm not sure what we would have done without your help."
"165399380-0-25082";"I love this town. It's so peaceful, unlike most of Cyrodiil since this stupid war began."
"165399380-0-25083";"This one finds Vlastarus to his liking. A simple life, easy work, and the others keep danger at bay. Fezdal plans a long stay."
"165399380-0-25084";"These ironwood trees are so tough, it's a race to see what breaks first—the axe or my arms."
"165399380-0-25085";"The people here drive me crazy, all so happy. Maybe there's something in the water. An army could wipe out the town at any minute. But no one seems concerned.\n\nIf it weren't so dangerous on the roads, I'd be long gone."
"165399380-0-25086";"The water here tastes so sweet! I'm just happy to be alive after fleeing Pell's Gate."
"165399380-0-25090";"By the docks. Seyne is defending the fishermen, but the Covenant will soon pull her down. You must help her!"
"165399380-0-25094";"I fell fighting beside Captain Rana. She hid me here and ran onto the ship. \n\nShe's after the Covenant commander. He's the one who burned Bleakrock."
"165399380-0-25095";"If they try to take the villagers, we'll stop them in their tracks."
"165399380-0-25097";"Why are you here? I'm the prince's chosen one. What does he want with you?"
"165399380-0-25098";"Can you see how wonderful this is? My prince has made all my dreams come true!"
"165399380-0-25099";"If those bastards push on the tomb, we'll push back. We are not mice.\n\nWe are men."
"165399380-0-25108";"Don't tell me you have a problem too."
"165399380-0-25110";"Thank Kyne you've returned. \n\nEveryone. They're all gone. My family is gone."
"165399380-0-25112";"My son …."
"165399380-0-25113";"<This man's throat has been cut, as if taken in a surprise attack.>"
"165399380-0-25114";"Who are you? Did Skorvild send you?"
"165399380-0-25126";"Need a blade? \n\nI hope not. I don't have any to spare."
"165399380-0-25129";"Looking for rations? \n\nKeep going down the river, friend. Everything here is spoken for."
"165399380-0-25133";"Get out of my sight!"
"165399380-0-25138";"My love …."
"165399380-0-25144";"Travel down the river is not cheap. It's a good thing your friend here is a fast talker."
"165399380-0-25163";"A cold wind blows, giants stomp through our village, and we have nothing but the shirts on our backs to keep us warm.\n\nYou've picked a poor time to visit Lower Yorgrim."
"165399380-0-25166";"The Breton dies here.\n\nAre you ready?"
"165399380-0-25167";"The commander of this vessel is the one who led the slaughter at Bleakrock. \n\nThis ship will be his grave."
"165399380-0-25169";"We … we won! We're still alive!\n\nI can't wait to see Trynhild again. I have so much to tell her."
"165399380-0-25170";"I did it! I gutted one of those fools just as he was going for Father. We won!"
"165399380-0-25171";"After all we lost at Bleakrock, it means so much to be able to cheer.\n\nVictory for the Pact!"
"165399380-0-25172";"I can't wait to tell Rolly I lived! She'll be so happy!"
"165399380-0-25174";"That turned out all right, didn't it? \n\nThe commander says I could do well in the army. I'm going to sign up."
"165399380-0-25175";"Thank you, Hero of Bleakrock. You're the Hero of Bal Foyen!"
"165399380-0-25176";"Those Daggers are nothing to joke about, but today, we have something to celebrate. Go well."
"165399380-0-25210";"I understand I have you to thank for driving the Covenant from these docks. \n\nThe Pact owes you a debt."
"165399380-0-25214";"I should have checked the window. \n\nNords tend to break things, not sneak through them."
"165399380-0-25260";"Thanks for dealing with that ugly Orc for me! That should teach the rest of those Stormfists a lesson."
"165399380-0-25265";"Take my advice. Go and forget you ever met us."
"165399380-0-25266";"Thank you for your work, but we no longer have need of you here."
"165399380-0-25267";"You're interrupting my prayers. What is it?"
"165399380-0-25268";"I've no time for pleasantries. Speak."
"165399380-0-25276";"I don't know what I'm going to do. Trynhild wants to run off and join the war. Littrek already has a sword.\n\nMy home, my family … what else can they take from me?"
"165399380-0-25277";"I've never trained with a sword. Do you think maybe I could just use a wood axe?"
"165399380-0-25278";"No, Littrek. Hold the blade like so.\n\nSorry, friend. No time to talk right now."
"165399380-0-25279";"Rolly, what are you thinking? You've got that look in your eye."
"165399380-0-25281";"I'm thinking about joining up. I think the Pact needs a few stubborn curs like me."
"165399380-0-25282";"I can't believe how few of us have made it. All that death. And for what?"
"165399380-0-25283";"Shor take the whole Covenant!\n\nLook after Brend and Faltha. I already miss those milk drinkers."
"165399380-0-25284";"Someone stole my sweetroll!"
"165399380-0-25285";"I'm going to join up, and nothing Mother says will stop me. \n\nI'm not too young. I can hold a sword. I'm ready to fight. I'm better than my daft brother Littrek, anyway."
"165399380-0-25287";"Has to be sharp. Has to be very, very sharp. Has a lot of work to do, yes?\n\nMany new friends to make."
"165399380-0-25288";"Eiman, be brave. I'll send you off with the other villagers. You'll be safe.\n\nI need your help. We need to make the Covenant pay for what they did on Bleakrock. All right?"
"165399380-0-25289";"Hey there, my friend. Vivec keep you safe. \n\nMay Vivec keep us all safe, eh?"
"165399380-0-25307";"You search the body and find the maguffin."
"165399380-0-25316";"I'm ready to start making mead!"
"165399380-0-25317";"The Daggers are cowards. They attack the weak and hide behind tricks.\n\nThese soldiers thought I was a defenseless farmer. I've corrected that error."
"165399380-0-25318";"Some of the Daggers came up here looking for fresh game. That's not what they found.\n\nThere are some civilian families here, but you can move on. I'll protect them."
"165399380-0-25322";"Go away … honey … so yummy."
"165399380-0-25327";"We followed you and Yraldar dealt with the remaining Stormfists before heading back out. The meadery is completely secure now.\n\nRoruld is already at work downstairs. We want to start filling orders as quickly as we can."
"165399380-0-25348";"And what can I offer you?"
"165399380-0-25349";"Dangerous times to walk the roads alone, but one must earn a living."
"165399380-0-25350";"Do you know the secret to Nord courage? It's mead. Makes them too bold to back down, and too numb to feel pain.\n\nSo, feel like getting brave?"
"165399380-0-25351";"I don't have much of a selection, but on the other hand, I don't have much competition out here."
"165399380-0-25353";"Just as the mud is moved by the river, my goods follow a stream of coins.\n\nThe current is … uh, slow and … er, muddy. Or something like that."
"165399380-0-25368";"I'm the official greeper—I … I mean, greeter.\n\nWelcome to Voljar's Meadery."
"165399380-0-25370";"Best deals this side of Alten Corimont, and my goods aren't even stolen."
"165399380-0-25373";"<<1>>, at your service! I bring the best these marshes have to offer!\n\nAfter all, why brave the leeches when I've done it for you?"
"165399380-0-25377";"Is it safe out there?"
"165399380-0-25378";"Who are you? What are you doing out here?"
"165399380-0-25380";"The Covenant attacked the docks. We surrendered. We're fishermen. We spear fish, not men.\n\nBut today, we were the Covenant's catch. The ones they caught, they gutted and threw into the sea."
"165399380-0-25383";"Mind yourself, stranger. Many dangers roam Lower Yorgrim this day."
"165399380-0-25384";"You should talk to our leader, Skorvild. He knows exactly what Lower Yorgrim needs right now."
"165399380-0-25409";"I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it."
"165399380-0-25413";"I wouldn't go that way if I were you, traveler."
"165399380-0-25430";"This fermented honey tastes wonderful!"
"165399380-0-25431";"I heartily recommend the flavor of the day. It's delicious!"
"165399380-0-25432";"As good as ever. You'd never know Roruld wasn't a true Voljar."
"165399380-0-25434";"Thanks!"
"165399380-0-25435";"Thank you!"
"165399380-0-25437";"It wasn't Droi we had to worry about. Ghain was under the witches' control the entire time. I just thought he was drunk and moody.\n\nOnce the Captain left, he attacked me."
"165399380-0-25438";"You did it, didn't you? Ormi is dead. You avenged my brigade. Thank you."
"165399380-0-25439";"Fresgil told us what happened.\n\nThank you for saving our friend. We'll honor those we lost this day. We'll make them proud!"
"165399380-0-25440";"You did what we were too frightened to do. Thank you."
"165399380-0-25442";"If you're looking for a hired blade, look somewhere else. I don't do that anymore."
"165399380-0-25452";"Sahun's alive? He wasn't killed? \n\nI have been such a fool."
"165399380-0-25453";"Why would you do this to yourself, mother? To all these people?\n\nListen, traveler. I know she did horrible things, but she's still my mother. Kyne must forgive her. The goddess never gives up on her people."
"165399380-0-25454";"My poor Denskar and Littrek. If only there'd been more of us …."
"165399380-0-25467";"Kyne's cleansed me. She's forgiven me for everything I've done.\n\nHow could I have been so foolish? I hurt so many people during my crisis of faith."
"165399380-0-25469";"Hi, I've got a quest that you start from an inventory item. \n\nType ]createitem 1854"
"165399380-0-25499";"By the docks. Seyne's defending the fisherfolk but she'll soon be overtaken. You must help her."
"165399380-0-25543";"I'm so glad I could save all these lives. \n\nAnd all these coins, as well. These poor, innocent coins. I will protect them."
"165399380-0-25544";"Did Captain Hamar send you? Are you our support?"
"165399380-0-25546";"It's about time Windhelm sent someone. What took you so long?"
"165399380-0-25553";"<You see shackle marks on the Argonian's neck and wrists. A broken link of gold chain is embedded in his scales.>"
"165399380-0-25554";"I must never forget the lives lost because of my mistakes.\n\nI took a trophy from that Breton. It will … remind me."
"165399380-0-25556";"Comrade! I'm heading to Fort Zeren to join the defenders. Perhaps I'll see you there."
"165399380-0-25557";"Can I interest you in any of my wares, serjo?"
"165399380-0-25576";"While hunting on Bleakrock, we ran into bandits sometimes … bandits and wolves.\n\nNever fought in a war before. I wonder what tomorrow will be like."
"165399380-0-25579";"Be careful, Geilund. You're not a hero.\n\nYou be careful too, friend."
"165399380-0-25580";"I've been practicing since we got to the fort. I think I'll be able to pitch in here and there at the edges of the battle."
"165399380-0-25582";"Darj told me to stay out of the way. He said I shouldn't look threatening during the battle. \n\nI think I can do that."
"165399380-0-25583";"Father and I are training hard. I think we'll be ready."
"165399380-0-25584";"Watch your form there, son. Hold the sword higher, over your heart.\n\nAnd take care during the battle, friend."
"165399380-0-25597";"I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it."
"165399380-0-25598";"I don't want to look at my wounds. You do it."
"165399380-0-25611";"Glad to see you. I came to be with my men. The Daggers almost had us.\n\nGo. Darj has need of you."
"165399380-0-25612";"The Daggerfall Covenant attacked the village and set fire to everything!"
"165399380-0-25614";"I did it! I gutted one of those bastards just as he was stepping out of a portal.\n\nWe won!"
"165399380-0-25615";"You did well Littrek.\n\nAnd you, as well, my friend. Thank you."
"165399380-0-25618";"Vlastarus is a wonderful place to live, but lately I worry about our safety."
"165399380-0-25622";"You look brave … brave like my Gena.\n\nPlease. Help me?"
"165399380-0-25623";"It just ignored the flute. \n\nIf this nix-hound hadn't saved me, I would have been eaten."
"165399380-0-25649";"The flute. It ate the flute. \n\nIf the nix-hounds I tamed hadn't saved me, I would have been next."
"165399380-0-25654";"She's safe. Wounded, out of breath, and unnerved, but safe."
"165399380-0-25663";"I am Nurnhilde, Queen of the Nords. I come to you from Sovngarde with an urgent demand."
"165399380-0-25672";"See anything you'd like to buy? \n\nI've got to get back home."
"165399380-0-25688";"Well met, my friend!"
"165399380-0-25690";"These dock workers would sleep the day away, if they could. It dries my scales.\n\nSorry, friend, too busy to talk."
"165399380-0-25691";"What can I do for you, friend? I'm waiting on my lady love, the beautiful Famdii.\n\nIsn't it a beautiful day?"
"165399380-0-25693";"No time for you. Got to keep my eyes open. We had a fishing vessel go out yesterday, and it hasn't come back yet.\n\nWeather's been good. So it could be trouble."
"165399380-0-25694";"My whole life. Spent my whole life with him. And what do I have to show for it?\n\nNothing. Shor's buttocks."
"165399380-0-25695";"The cool water flows and cleanses the mind. Stay a while and listen to the water, yes?"
"165399380-0-25696";"They seem very intent, yes? Training as if there is no tomorrow.\n\nI think perhaps it is time I went west to join my cousins in Lukiul Uxith."
"165399380-0-25700";"You need some fish, yes? What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-25703";"There's a fish in these waters named Firescales. It's said to be nearly six feet long with eyes like coals. \n\nEver seen such a thing? If you do, steer clear. Dangerous fish. Dangerous fish."
"165399380-0-25706";"All these freaks are running around the Ashlands these days! Shellbacks used to know their place, Vivec curse them. And these trolls from the north. Can smell them from up here. \n\nWhat?"
"165399380-0-25708";"Are you here to stand with Fort Zeren?"
"165399380-0-25709";"Do you stand with Fort Zeren?"
"165399380-0-25710";"Thanks. It's the rare soul who stops to help an opponent."
"165399380-0-25711";"The Covenant flooded the docks. We tried to surrender, but they didn't want prisoners. \n\nMany of us were gutted and thrown into the sea."
"165399380-0-25714";"Wars come and wars go, but the Hist endures."
"165399380-0-25715";"Your victory at Zeren will be welcome news to the Pact.\n\nHowever, I have to report some grave losses at the dockyards."
"165399380-0-25716";"The barracks are clear. How did you fare against Halskar?"
"165399380-0-25720";"I wonder if this Pact of ours will actually accomplish anything meaningful."
"165399380-0-25722";"This is terrible!"
"165399380-0-25723";"So you're the one I've heard about! Darj speaks highly of you."
"165399380-0-25724";"What happened? My neck is killing me and I feel like I drank an entire barrel of mead."
"165399380-0-25725";"Kyne sent us a miracle, my friend.\n\nWhen some of the witches showed up here, I thought we were finished. Then they started tending to our wounds. They left without saying a word. I'm so confused!"
"165399380-0-25727";"I have been waiting for you to arrive."
"165399380-0-25731";"Fresgil says you're the one who helped me. Thank you.\n\nI'm not really sure what happened, but I think I've had enough rest and relaxation."
"165399380-0-25732";"My apologies, but these are dangerous times. I can't simply greet a traveler with open arms after I watched my soldiers turn into mindless slaves.\n\nI had to make sure your will was your own."
"165399380-0-25744";"Well met. As you can see, I've gathered the remaining Bleakrock veterans. \n\nWe're family now, to hear Aera tell it. We'll see."
"165399380-0-25747";"<Aera doesn't look up. Tears stream down her face as she quietly sobs.>"
"165399380-0-25754";"I've been praying for Trynhild, telling her about our victory at the fort.\n\nI think … I think she'd be proud of me."
"165399380-0-25755";"How's a father supposed to feel? You're not supposed to outlive your daughter.\n\nAnd Aera …."
"165399380-0-25756";"Rolly. Rolly, why did you have to leave me? \n\nI'm so sorry I went to the cave, sister. I'll never do it again."
"165399380-0-25758";"It's sad to have lost so many people. \n\nBut honestly, my friend, I'm just glad to be alive."
"165399380-0-25759";"After all we've been through, I'm just so tired. So tired."
"165399380-0-25760";"My friends are all dead. Faltha. Brend. Runs-in-Wild. \n\nJust a short while ago, we were hunting together on Bleakrock."
"165399380-0-25761";"They're all gone. They're going down the river to meet the sea. I'm going to miss them.\n\nVery, very much."
"165399380-0-25765";"<Aera doesn't look up. Tears stream down her face as she quietly sobs.>"
"165399380-0-25766";"Despite the pain, I'm glad we're standing together today to lament the loss of friends and comrades.\n\nThat may be selfish, but it's true."
"165399380-0-25767";"We survived the trial Vivec set for us. Hard to believe, even now."
"165399380-0-25768";"The stump still acts up, of course, but at least I'm around to complain."
"165399380-0-25769";"Damn that brother of mine. He went and got himself killed.\n\nAnd damn the Daggers, too. Every last one of them."
"165399380-0-25770";"My Pa and brother are dead. I can't believe it.\n\nI can't imagine what my mother must be feeling."
"165399380-0-25771";"I expect you've come to learn the secrets of great mages?\n\nThere's ultimately one secret. Do not compromise. If you believe something is true, you must require the Mundus to act in accordance with your will."
"165399380-0-25779";"Spies in the trees, assassins in the shadows. We must stay vigilant!"
"165399380-0-25780";"You're here! I knew you would show up! And you're here to make a deal, right?\n\nWe show you to the Dominion's treasure ship. You take their prize, and we all stay alive. Much better than the alternative!"
"165399380-0-25781";"This is the last straw, the final insult of many!"
"165399380-0-25784";"Eh, you're a fine one, aren't you? S'jash say we take orders from you, no questions.\n\nMaybe I'm done with this place now. No offense, friend."
"165399380-0-25785";"Thank you for keeping S'jash alive. He knows about the best jobs.\n\nWe will find another one soon, yes?"
"165399380-0-25796";"A bit of gold to keep out the cold?"
"165399380-0-25797";"There's nothing in this city worth doing. It's all snow and more snow.\n\nNot a decent cornerclub anywhere. Someone really should open one."
"165399380-0-25800";"Please help me! I pushed her down and now she's gone.\n\nIt was the only way I could get away from those horrible monsters!"
"165399380-0-25801";"These Daedra worshiping cultists have stolen my Crystal of Power!"
"165399380-0-25802";"Hey there. Hungry? I'm your woman."
"165399380-0-25803";"Kyne keep you, friend! Come to turn some trash into treasure?"
"165399380-0-25805";"The river delivers you to Bal Foyen. Welcome.\n\nHungry?"
"165399380-0-25806";"We saw the boat, so we came to help. With drink, and food, and … you have coin, yes?"
"165399380-0-25809";"This is wrong. Something is terribly, terribly wrong."
"165399380-0-25811";"The last sunset stained the land like a great battle. It seemed a portent.\n\nWho knows what the next eve will bring?"
"165399380-0-25812";"Greetings! Are you here to learn our secret techniques?\n\nI must warn you, if you're a spy from the Mages Guild, I'll have to cut your head off."
"165399380-0-25821";"Ah, you're back! Lieutenant Koruni's plan worked perfectly. And she says she owes her success to you. Good job!"
"165399380-0-25822";"I no longer know my own brother's heart, but now I know yours.\n\nEven though Fildgor escaped with my crown and my mortal remains, you have performed a great service this day."
"165399380-0-25825";"Whatever your problem is, soldier, someone else will have to solve it. This camp is going to be the death of me."
"165399380-0-25826";"Thirsty? Brew your own!"
"165399380-0-25827";"You rescued my soldiers. For that, you have my thanks."
"165399380-0-25834";"All this mud makes me thirsty.\n\nIs it the same with you? I can help."
"165399380-0-25835";"You swim now into Bal Foyen. Welcome.\n\nHungry?"
"165399380-0-25855";"Looking for rations? \n\nKeep on going down the river, friend. Everything here is spoken for."
"165399380-0-25860";"Keep that thing away from me!\n\nI was already bitten once and I don't want to be a feast for that vile creature!"
"165399380-0-25862";"Scales here is about to have a really bad day if she doesn't come with me right now.\n\nThat bite … it's spreading faster than she realizes."
"165399380-0-25867";"The fight on Bleakrock was hard. The fight for Bal Foyen will be harder. \n\nWill you take a moment and pray with me?"
"165399380-0-25868";"This pup is confident that we'll repel the Daggers. After Bleakrock, I'm not confident in anything.\n\nThe only things I trust are my blade, my sergeant, and you."
"165399380-0-25869";"Endril. Aide to Centurion Mobareed, commander at Fort Zeren. We're here to secure the docks.\n\nIf the Covenant attacks, we'll be ready for them."
"165399380-0-25870";"A one-legged Nord versus the Daggerfall Covenant. Ha! \n\nPoor milk-drinking Daggers. They're as good as dead."
"165399380-0-25871";"Whatever comes down the river, I'm ready.\n\nLet's see whose teeth are sharpest, yes?"
"165399380-0-25872";"Damn that brother of mine. Went and got himself killed.\n\nAnd damn the Daggers, too. Every single last one of them."
"165399380-0-25875";"Let's move!"
"165399380-0-25880";"My baby! She was so beautiful. Why did the Three let this happen?"
"165399380-0-25881";"I hate to even ask this, but can you help us?"
"165399380-0-25911";"They try to get to the hatchlings, again and again.\n\nThey have much to learn, yes?"
"165399380-0-25915";"What can I do for you, friend? I'm waiting on my lady love, the beautiful Famdii.\n\nGorgeous day, no?"
"165399380-0-25921";"I'll be fine, don't worry. The surgeon will get me patched right up."
"165399380-0-25922";"You did great, Tryn. Don't worry. The healer will fix you up.\n\nShe did great, didn't she?"
"165399380-0-25923";"Thanks for your help back there. We're now family by blood and steel.\n\nDon't worry: I treat my family well. Ha!"
"165399380-0-25924";"Just need a bit of a rest.\n\nBlasted stump. Shouldn't've tried to kick with it."
"165399380-0-25925";"The wind sings a victory song, yes? \n\nI think I'll take some time to bask in the sun and forget about killing."
"165399380-0-25939";"I'm a little busy at the moment. Come back later."
"165399380-0-25940";"I love coming out here and basking in all this nature!"
"165399380-0-25941";"Mead or milk? Are you a Nord or a gnat?"
"165399380-0-25943";"I am recovering, but the process is slower than I'd like."
"165399380-0-25944";"Man, I hate this place. It's filthy and full of filthy people. I just, well, I just hate this place. I like being outside."
"165399380-0-25948";"My, you're a hardy one!"
"165399380-0-25949";"There's more to battle than strength and physical training. Knowledge is also power. What can I teach you today?"
"165399380-0-25951";"The river has brought us victory, yes? After Bleakrock, it is well deserved.\n\nNow, I think I will take some time to bask in the sun and forget about death."
"165399380-0-25953";"I bring news from Fort Zeren. It's grim, I'm afraid."
"165399380-0-25954";"The Skald-King holds you in high regard, and so do I."
"165399380-0-25955";"Get me out of this filthy cage!"
"165399380-0-25961";"This chamber contains the remains of the honored cupbearers who served the rulers of Skyrim."
"165399380-0-25991";"This chamber contains the remains of advisors who served the throne. Trusted counselors, viziers, and shamans are buried here."
"165399380-0-26027";"Yeah, I'm kinda new around here, but still don't try anything. Are you new too?"
"165399380-0-26029";"No, no! The story's all wrong! The temple's version should be right, but it's not.\n\nToo late to start over, too late to end. What to do …."
"165399380-0-26031";"Your help during these troubled times has been most appreciated."
"165399380-0-26032";"Like a wolf pack, we'll work together to take down Fildgor Orcthane."
"165399380-0-26033";"War makes strange egg-brothers, it seems."
"165399380-0-26034";"The time has come to crush Fildgor and the Stormfist Brigade once and for all."
"165399380-0-26065";"Watch yourself on the roads, stranger. Bandits and monsters at every step. I'm camping out here until someone restores order in Cyrodiil."
"165399380-0-26067";"Well met, my courageous friend! The time of our victory is at hand!"
"165399380-0-26079";"All this talk of war makes me thirsty. I need a mead."
"165399380-0-26087";"I've been waiting for you to arrive."
"165399380-0-26089";"I have a request, stranger. I know we've just met but are you willing to risk heresy for the greater good?"
"165399380-0-26090";"The Three keep you, traveler. Are … are you willing to risk heresy to save the soul of Ebonheart?"
"165399380-0-26095";"Who are you? Where did you come from? What am I doing here?\n\nWait, I think it's all coming back to me …."
"165399380-0-26098";"The big ones spotted your approach. Be warned. Cradlecrush isn't the idyllic place it once was."
"165399380-0-26099";"Your scent is familiar, but I do not know you. Why do you interrupt my courtship of the Hound?"
"165399380-0-26101";"We'll hold out as long as we have to. Nothing's getting past my blades!"
"165399380-0-26102";"Ah, the challenger finally arrives! Let's see how well you play the part, shall we?"
"165399380-0-26139";"I would tell you a tale of feasts and frivolity, but our tongues are as tied as our hands."
"165399380-0-26141";"The Silvenar, first of the wild children with eyes open. He alone knows the ways and wiles of the Valenwood!\n\nWhat use is the Green Lady to him, I ask you? A distraction, nothing more."
"165399380-0-26143";"You're not one of my soldiers. Do you need something?"
"165399380-0-26152";"My friend! It's good to see you again. As you can see, I've gathered the remaining Bleakrock veterans. \n\nTo hear Aera tell it, we're family now. We'll see."
"165399380-0-26154";"How is a father suppoesd to feel? You're not supposed to outlive your daughter.\n\nAnd Aera …."
"165399380-0-26157";"At least I've got my Tryn, right? \n\nAnd Rexus. He's a good boy."
"165399380-0-26158";"It's hard to take in a big city like this. Look at it all.\n\nDid you see the Hist Tree? Kind of amazing."
"165399380-0-26159";"We're out in the big world now. Tryn and I are going to get some real training."
"165399380-0-26160";"Going to get a custom wooden leg made up here in the city. Then old Hoknir will be back to fighting fit."
"165399380-0-26163";"Welcome to camp, my friend. \n\nAfter Bal Foyen, I thought for sure that Seyne and I would be reassigned immediately. Still haven't heard from command, though."
"165399380-0-26165";"My men insist that Tryn's death wasn't in vain, that she gave her life in defense of the powerless.\n\nThe Pact is stronger, but my heart is weaker. My Tryn …."
"165399380-0-26169";"Our protector returns. \n\nThis time with Darj has been a challege, but it's time we found work. Maera and I are used to selling, trading, and making things."
"165399380-0-26170";"Hope you're taking care of yourself. I'm just trying to find one of my lighter dresses. It's so much hotter in the Ashlands than it was on Bleakrock."
"165399380-0-26171";"Sometimes, I still talk to Rolly in my head. I ask her things, like, ""What should I do now?""\n\nThe Earth-Turners are joining the army, but I'm much better with a cookpot than I am with a blade."
"165399380-0-26172";"The Earth-Turners are going to make stone-blood warriors. \n\nBut I'm still not used to being in command."
"165399380-0-26173";"Darj asked me to be part of his new command! Exciting times. \n\nIt won't replace my fallen friends, but I'll fight to make sure they didn't die in vain."
"165399380-0-26174";"Still got some details to sort out. Lot of supplies to gather before we make for Deshaan."
"165399380-0-26175";"I have my own group of irregulars! I'm proud to receive so much responsibility. Kyne willing, we'll make a difference in this war. \n\nThe Pact will remember Bleakrock! I can't wait until we muster out."
"165399380-0-26176";"Amazing, how these warriors handle themselves. I think we could learn a lot from them. If father would let us."
"165399380-0-26177";"I don't trust these guild mercenaries. Littrek may think they're heroes, but I know their type.\n\nShor's bones! If Darj hadn't proven himself worthy, I don't know where we would be."
"165399380-0-26178";"Ah, my fellow hunter. Nice to see you from this height. With the new foot, I'm as agile as an ice wolf."
"165399380-0-26179";"It's funny, these Fighters Guild contractors. They're all hunting Daedra. \n\nWhy Daedra? Who's paying for that?"
"165399380-0-26180";"Trynhild won't stop talking about these spell-slingers. It's all I can do to convince her not to join the Mages Guild."
"165399380-0-26181";"Oh, hey! Good to see you again. \n\nHave you seen what those mages can do? Saw one pull a Daedra out of thin air. Wish I had that kind of power."
"165399380-0-26182";"Justice and honor, friend. Seyne and I finally have our orders. We're being sent to Deshaan to help with some local troubles there."
"165399380-0-26183";"May the Three bless you … and us, as well.\n\nAs long as our faith remains strong, we'll be ready."
"165399380-0-26198";"Whickmuz greets you, walker. It is always pleasant to have visitors, no?"
"165399380-0-26207";"Please don't beat me. Yesterday's bruises still hurt."
"165399380-0-26208";"The Worms come down now and then to take some of us into the castle."
"165399380-0-26209";"Keep your head down, or they'll take you away, too."
"165399380-0-26210";"What hope? What hope is there for us?"
"165399380-0-26211";"Worm Cult murderers killed my clan and turned us all into these … shades! Those dogs!"
"165399380-0-26212";"My brother Gahznar and I were sacrificed on a black altar and sent here to slave away.\n\nSo here we are. What choice do we have but to serve?"
"165399380-0-26213";"My wretched cousin had me sold off to the Worm Cult as a sacrifice so he could steal my wife and my home.\n\nIf I ever get out of here…."
"165399380-0-26214";"Famazar wishes he at least had his wares. Even Worms need new clothes, yes?"
"165399380-0-26215";"I miss the smell of the oasis at dawn. This place has no scent."
"165399380-0-26216";"What? You think it's only you provincials the Worm Cult murders?"
"165399380-0-26225";"Please help! The Worm Cult's got her!"
"165399380-0-26226";"Please, you've got to save her! The Worm Cult's taken her!"
"165399380-0-26238";"Ouze was always a sad place, but now it's dangerous as well."
"165399380-0-26245";"I see victory in your eyes! What did you find on the Stormfist scouts?"
"165399380-0-26249";"<The Giant stares at you blankly.>"
"165399380-0-26314";"Hail and well met."
"165399380-0-26317";"Something in the story seeks to destroy me. You must not allow this!\n\nI will summon my allies, but I cannot do this alone. Will you help?"
"165399380-0-26324";"Another traveler wanders in. But you don't look like a bard."
"165399380-0-26373";"Taste this. I think it needs a pinch more salt."
"165399380-0-26375";"Herbs. Who needs them? Fancy folk, that's who."
"165399380-0-26464";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-26486";"A fine gathering. A fine gathering, indeed."
"165399380-0-26488";"Looks like you've been busy!"
"165399380-0-26489";"Great party. Plenty of mead. And plenty of memories …."
"165399380-0-26491";"Looks like you've been busy!"
"165399380-0-26492";"I can't believe this happened. All of my friends …."
"165399380-0-26494";"This Voljar mead tastes so good! I can't feel my nose!"
"165399380-0-26495";"I like hard work, but I like hard drinking even better!"
"165399380-0-26509";"You must help my daughter! <<1>>, he's attacked us!"
"165399380-0-26510";"We'll never be the same again."
"165399380-0-26511";"Ouze was always a sad place, but now it is dangerous, too."
"165399380-0-26513";"You did well. Better than I or my master expected. Now, only one task remains."
"165399380-0-26516";"How could this have happened?"
"165399380-0-26523";"Come over here immediately!"
"165399380-0-26531";"You've stumbled into the wrong place, stranger.\n\nIt's not safe here. I'd recommend leaving as soon as you can. And be careful outside."
"165399380-0-26532";"Let me out of here! Please. This isn't right!\n\nYou're killing me! You gave me to these creatures and they're going to use me as food. Why would you do such a thing?"
"165399380-0-26543";"I save people!"
"165399380-0-26554";"I'm tired of being stuck in here all day long. Such a shame. When we walk in the beautiful sunlight, we burst into flames.\n\nThough I suppose it does make taking a stroll more exciting."
"165399380-0-26556";"The graveyard of Ouze has been at peace for many years. No longer."
"165399380-0-26557";"Did you need help with something?"
"165399380-0-26558";"An outsider? Jaruk has not seen one in many years. Outsiders tend to fear us.\n\nCome, pull up a chair. Let us entertain you. It's not like we're going anywhere."
"165399380-0-26560";"Please, help. The Orcs …."
"165399380-0-26562";"You need a drink, my friend!"
"165399380-0-26563";"Sweeping up after a bunch of rowdy road workers is an endless task."
"165399380-0-26564";"That bard said he was from Solitude. Probably went to the Bards College there. \n\nYou know, I think I like educated men."
"165399380-0-26565";"Not now … sleeping …."
"165399380-0-26566";"The women won't stop talking about that fancy-pants bard and how handsome he is. It's shameful, really."
"165399380-0-26567";"We work hard. Usually for days on end. It's good to relax and have a bit of fun every now and then."
"165399380-0-26572";"Perhaps a ship will arrive soon. We could use the supplies."
"165399380-0-26575";"Remarkable what sells in the Ashlands. Mushrooms, kwama eggs. Trade here bears little resemblence to trade in Skyrim.\n\nWhat do they do without horker fat?"
"165399380-0-26576";"Sorry, I'm talking to this nice Khajiit. She has a unique perspective on what it takes to trade with the Dark Elves."
"165399380-0-26578";"Gold! Gold for the poor!\n\nA giant destroyed my home, and now I'm cold and hungry."
"165399380-0-26583";"That mangy wolf bit me!"
"165399380-0-26585";"The wolves are almost worse than the giants!\n\nI just pray we survive the night."
"165399380-0-26586";"If you're looking for my wife, Eiraki, you can find her inside."
"165399380-0-26592";"Welcome back, friend. You survived the challenge and helped the giants take back the stronghold.\n\nI couldn't have asked for a better resolution to this situation. Well done!"
"165399380-0-26594";"You've made contact with Majorn's son, Valeric. He's a troubled young man, ashamed of his heritage.\n\nMajorn simply wishes to end the conflict with his son. For this reason, my lord requests to meet with you."
"165399380-0-26595";"There was nothing I could do."
"165399380-0-26597";"My poor wife! The giant swung its club and shattered her leg.\n\nOh, what am I going to do?"
"165399380-0-26598";"Look, I appreciate what Skorvild does for the village. Everybody does. But I find him a bit too … intense. Know what I mean?"
"165399380-0-26599";"Don't mind my cousin. She never could keep her opinions to herself."
"165399380-0-26600";"These are dangerous times to walk the roads alone, but one must make a living."
"165399380-0-26601";"I'm not as strong or as fast as I used to be."
"165399380-0-26603";"There's nothing left."
"165399380-0-26604";"Something out there smells terrible. Whatever it is, I'm sure it attracted the giants and wolves to our village."
"165399380-0-26609";"Get me out of here!"
"165399380-0-26610";"Been busy on the roads lately, guess everyone wants a chance to see the Green Lady while she's here. Anything I can provide you with?"
"165399380-0-26611";"Mammoth tusks fetch a high price, but they aren't worth the risk. I'll stick to safer stock. Can I interest you in anything?"
"165399380-0-26612";"My stock isn't as plentiful as it once was, thanks to those thieving Drublog, but you're welcome to browse what remains."
"165399380-0-26615";"The spinners say the things you dream are worth more than the things you have, but don't get any bright ideas. I'm a pragmatist. Cash only."
"165399380-0-26616";"I must speak with you."
"165399380-0-26617";"I don't much envy merchants tied down to a stall. I belong on the open road, seeing new things and meeting new people. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-26658";"Greetings."
"165399380-0-26667";"Ouze was always a sad place, but now it's dangerous as well."
"165399380-0-26677";"I'm Berj's assistant. He keeps me pretty busy."
"165399380-0-26679";"Welcome to Cragwallow!"
"165399380-0-26680";"Ouze is in terrible danger as long as the Worm Cult's here."
"165399380-0-26681";"Ouze was always a sad place, but now it's dangerous as well."
"165399380-0-26683";"We're all doomed. Almalexia save us!"
"165399380-0-26684";"Be careful! Whatever attacked us might still be nearby."
"165399380-0-26689";"We had to lock Scales up so she wouldn't try to escape. It's nothing to worry about. More about her safety … and everyone else's.\n\nIt won't be long until she starts getting that crazed look in her eyes."
"165399380-0-26690";"Valeric's plan might actually work this time!\n\nI don't remember ever saying that before. Can't get too excited, though. There are a hundred ways this could still go horribly wrong."
"165399380-0-26691";"Ha! This one's special concoction has changed the scent of the hunters. The bloodfiends will never find them now.\n\nSometimes I surprise even myself."
"165399380-0-26692";"I'm going through so many changes right now. Feeling so many … sensations. It's wonderful. It's amazing. It's … is that urine I smell?\n\nI must write this in my journal so I never forget this moment."
"165399380-0-26693";"You're back. It's good to see a friendly face jus before the end."
"165399380-0-26694";"Please, leave me alone. I don't want to talk about what happened over there."
"165399380-0-26698";"Don't look at me!"
"165399380-0-26704";"Look at that sky. Get you something while you admire the view?"
"165399380-0-26707";"Don't sit here and chat. The Reachmen are everywhere!"
"165399380-0-26736";"It's a grim road, isn't it? Some spirits to calm your nerves?"
"165399380-0-26737";"With Majorn destroyed, perhaps we will finally have some peace.\n\nValeric believes we need to leave this place and find a better home for our kind. Jaruk hopes that such a place really exists."
"165399380-0-26741";"I was a fool for losing control like that. I can't thank you enough for helping me through that. I don't know what I would have done if the bloodlust had taken me."
"165399380-0-26742";"Valeric says the cure isn't working. I'm changing … becoming one of them.\n\nHe offered me a place in his family, so he could teach me how to control my … urges."
"165399380-0-26743";"The Three guide your steps. Need something for the road?"
"165399380-0-26749";"You must be curious as to why I summoned you.\n\nI want to give you an opportunity to learn my son's true intentions. His fire is admirable, but he does more harm than good."
"165399380-0-26750";"We wait for you, forest-elf. We will rip and tear your soft flesh."
"165399380-0-26751";"Friend of the Silvenar, the Green Lady went by! The way is blocked to you, but I can clear it.\n\nShall I lend you my aid?"
"165399380-0-26760";"You never know where the river will take you. Why not buy something on the way?"
"165399380-0-26761";"I was sent here to break the Reach encampment, but they were too much for me and my squad."
"165399380-0-26762";"The fort's much more pleasant without those Stormfists all over the place. Now what can I do for you? If you need it, I probably sell it."
"165399380-0-26764";"I'd like to taste boar someday. Maybe seasoned with thunderbug legs."
"165399380-0-26765";"Nilara needs to get out and do more if she wants any respect."
"165399380-0-26767";"Those Ra Gada brigands think they can take anything they want? Oh well, we'll show them how wrong they are!\n\nAs soon as <<1>> finds her spine again. Gods, I wish she wasn't the only one left!"
"165399380-0-26768";"What'll we do now?"
"165399380-0-26781";"Not all Bosmer wish me to be united with the Green Lady. Thankfully, I have allies like you."
"165399380-0-26798";"Beware! This is a place of angry death."
"165399380-0-26805";"You ruined it! His return. You brought his wrath!"
"165399380-0-26806";"My stock turns over quickly, so buy now before it's gone."
"165399380-0-26810";"Please, outsider, leave us be. The Ternion monks want no part in the war that rages across this land."
"165399380-0-26813";"The Ternion monks survived this long by avoiding conflict and remaining isolated.\n\nThis war that rages across Eastmarch, it must not come here. Our sacred temple has been sealed, closed to outsiders. You may not enter."
"165399380-0-26832";"Ouze is in terrible danger as long as the Worm Cult's here."
"165399380-0-26834";"We've done our part, now you do yours. Make sure the Reach do not return."
"165399380-0-26866";"<<1>> was once a great senche tamer. But now I have no senche. There is nothing left."
"165399380-0-26877";"Dinner will be ready when I'm done cooking it."
"165399380-0-26882";"I need you to wait by the docks for my signal - they'll never know what hit 'em!\n\nWait, you're not one of mine. You've stumbled into the wrong place."
"165399380-0-26884";"What'll we do now?"
"165399380-0-26885";"This structure is fascinating! How do the Ternion monks travel to and from the temple area?\n\nLarge birds? Maybe they climb like Bosmers? Or maybe they transform into insects and ride the winds up and down? I'd love to see that!"
"165399380-0-26904";"Can I interest you in something?"
"165399380-0-26926";"The dead aren't supposed to walk around, and they certainly aren't supposed to attack innocent loggers!"
"165399380-0-26949";"Xuth. Life is hard in this part of the Ashlands. Some Roasted Pike for the road?"
"165399380-0-26953";"If it were up to me, this gate would stay closed."
"165399380-0-26954";"What can the Pact do for you, traveler?"
"165399380-0-26957";"Kaoc, dryskin. You bother me. Buy what you need and move on."
"165399380-0-26958";"Soup! Soup for everyone!"
"165399380-0-26960";"Don't disturb the Skald-King. He needs his rest."
"165399380-0-26961";"We expect the Skald-King to make a full recovery. It will just take time."
"165399380-0-26964";"King Jorunn's son is worried and I don't blame him. Our healing magic is strong, but it's not much good against Daedra-corrupted poison.\n\nThe King won't awaken on his own."
"165399380-0-26965";"You again? If you do anything to harm my father, I will personally hunt you down and feed you to a Kagouti. Remember that."
"165399380-0-26974";"Listen to them howl! I wonder what stories they tell their cubs."
"165399380-0-27022";"Please, traveler. You have to help us!"
"165399380-0-27023";"Please, stop! The Worm Cult slaughtered my brother.\n\nDon't … don't let the family end up like him."
"165399380-0-27024";"Sal said you found <<1>>. I hope he comes back soon."
"165399380-0-27029";"What'll we do now?"
"165399380-0-27031";"I need you to wait by the docks for my signal - they'll never know what hit 'em!\n\nWait, you're not one of mine. You've stumbled into the wrong place, stranger."
"165399380-0-27032";"At last. I'd begun to give up hope. The Green Lady, she must be warned.\n\nYou, are you a friend to the Bosmer? I cannot see you clearly … Who are you?"
"165399380-0-27052";"You're walking, but you're not dead. You picked the wrong day to visit our camp, stranger."
"165399380-0-27053";"Did you find them? Is my family all right?"
"165399380-0-27056";"The Silvenar needs to be free to join with the Green Lady. Surely all Bosmer understand that?"
"165399380-0-27057";"If the Silvenar does not join with the Green Lady, I fear for the fate of the Bosmer."
"165399380-0-27058";"You picked a bad time to visit the Lost Knife Mine, stranger."
"165399380-0-27063";"Keep your voice down."
"165399380-0-27075";"Please, get me out of here!"
"165399380-0-27099";"Thanks!"
"165399380-0-27100";"Thank you!"
"165399380-0-27102";"I returned to Jakild after you went to the Barrow. We've been hiding in here.\n\nDid you find those Covenant milk-drinkers? Did you stop them?"
"165399380-0-27258";"We've held the Sea Vipers back so far, and we'll carpet the floor in dead Maormer before we let them pass.\n\nIf you wish to help us protect the sphere, speak to Cirnean. I'd welcome another sword to the cause."
"165399380-0-27261";"My father is strong. In fact, he's the strongest man I've ever known.\n\nHe'll pull through this. He has to."
"165399380-0-27263";"<This soldier appears to have died recently.>"
"165399380-0-27282";"Why do you continue to follow me? The Argonian that followed me couldn't handle the ordeal. You won't fare any better. Leave now before it's too late.\n\nToo many have already died on my behalf. I must handle this on my own."
"165399380-0-27288";"I apologize about the mess. Normally we keep this place quite clean!\n\nThe Sea Vipers insist on bleeding all over our floors. Awfully rude behavior for guests!"
"165399380-0-27289";"My apologies, stranger, but make sure to stay out of the line of fire. I can't let Dennir and Tharel get too far ahead of me in their count before we run out of invaders to kill."
"165399380-0-27290";"Don't worry about me. A lucky hit from one of the Sea Viper archers. He suffered far worse in the exchange.\n\nI'll be up in a few minutes … just need to catch my breath."
"165399380-0-27292";"I'm not even supposed to be here yet! I'm just an apprentice!\n\nI only arrived last week. Stormwardens swear to die for duty … I just didn't expect to do it so soon."
"165399380-0-27293";"If I were alive these caves would be silent. No bothersome cultists, no damned elves, I'd even squash the rats for good measure."
"165399380-0-27295";"He's dead. My <<1>> is dead."
"165399380-0-27299";"Kyne bless you! We'll join Ysgramor with honor, thanks to you."
"165399380-0-27300";"Boo! What, you've never seen a dead man before?"
"165399380-0-27318";"I love setting things on fire!"
"165399380-0-27320";"Quick! Untie me!"
"165399380-0-27321";"Quick! Untie me!"
"165399380-0-27322";"Quick! Untie me!"
"165399380-0-27323";"Quick! Untie me!"
"165399380-0-27324";"Please, get me out of here."
"165399380-0-27326";"By Anuiel's grace, I need your help.\n\nMaormer attacked our ship, and captured the surviving crew!"
"165399380-0-27328";"If I wore flesh these caves would be quiet. No bothersome cultists, no creepy elves, I'd even squash the rats for good measure."
"165399380-0-27339";"Did my sister, Eitaki, send you?"
"165399380-0-27340";"I saw you take out some of these bastards. That can only mean we're taking back the mine."
"165399380-0-27352";"Watch out, the mammoths are loose! We're all in danger!"
"165399380-0-27353";"If I live through this, I'm never leaving the library again."
"165399380-0-27354";"He's doomed and it's all my fault. I ran like a coward and left him there."
"165399380-0-27358";"This is a good place for me to continue my research. It's mostly quiet here, and the people keep to themselves, which I appreciate."
"165399380-0-27362";"Please. Help the dead find their rest."
"165399380-0-27380";"Are you a Jarl, a General, or a member of the gods-cursed Tribunal? No? Then shove off!"
"165399380-0-27381";"We meet again, my friend. I fear I am in some difficulty."
"165399380-0-27390";"Are you real or just part of this dream? Ouch! I hurt all over. Feels like my body is being crushed. And not in a fun way.\n\nWhy have you followed me? This experience, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
"165399380-0-27400";"Last evening's sunset stained the land red. It seemed a portent.\n\nWho knows what the next eve will bring?"
"165399380-0-27401";"Arm yourself well, friend. This area's deadly."
"165399380-0-27411";"How can we hope to defeat the evil that surrounds us?"
"165399380-0-27414";"I can feel the pull of evil magic, deep within the mine. Can't you?"
"165399380-0-27418";"Along came a traveler, seeking and offering wisdom on the path to enlightenment."
"165399380-0-27423";"Perhaps it's good that the mine's sealed off. Nothing but death awaits inside."
"165399380-0-27427";"No one who made it out of the mine will talk about it. It must have been horrible."
"165399380-0-27430";"The Worm Cultists killed several of our farmhands and used animus geodes to collect their souls!"
"165399380-0-27431";"Can I interest you in something?"
"165399380-0-27432";"Here. Take this."
"165399380-0-27434";"Those cultists ruined any chance we had of establishing contact with the Falmer. We were so close, damn them."
"165399380-0-27444";"Those damned Worm Cultists have ruined any chance we had of establishing communication with the Falmer. \n\nWe were so close. Our studies were nearly complete."
"165399380-0-27454";"Thanks to you, the mine is ours again."
"165399380-0-27456";"Not all Bosmer wish me to be united with the Green Lady. Thankfully, I have allies like you."
"165399380-0-27457";"If the Silvenar does not join with the Green Lady, I fear for the fate of the Bosmer."
"165399380-0-27458";"The Silvenar needs to be free to join with the Green Lady. Surely all Bosmer understand that?"
"165399380-0-27460";"The Pact is sealed! Long live the Ebonheart Pact!"
"165399380-0-27461";"Yes, yes, hooray for the Pact. Can we go back where it's warm now? I'm freezing out here!"
"165399380-0-27462";"My people trusted my sister. Loved her. Great Queen Nurnhilde, they called her. Leader of the Nords. Then the Akaviri attacked. The people lost their Queen and I lost my sister.\n\nThe realm wept the day she died."
"165399380-0-27463";"Yes? What do you want?"
"165399380-0-27464";"Thank you for helping my brother. He needs more friends like you.\n\nI'll make sure he wakes up after we finish our conversation."
"165399380-0-27467";"We're still alive! I never would have guessed that would be the result of all this.\n\nNow I need some rest. To study the Ternion monks and the Three Old Gods. Fascinating stuff. And, truth to tell, I don't want to go into any more dreams for awhile."
"165399380-0-27510";"I could use your help."
"165399380-0-27511";"I can sense Jorunn's troops coming up the mountain. But they will be too late.\n\nI am sorry, but this all falls to you. You are the only one who can reach Fildgor in time."
"165399380-0-27512";"I like animals better than people. They don't complain as much."
"165399380-0-27513";"Where have you been?"
"165399380-0-27519";"Thanks for helping us."
"165399380-0-27520";"What did you find when you took down the messenger?"
"165399380-0-27521";"Please, I need help. Something prevents me from rooting in Treehenge. I must take my place among the matrons!"
"165399380-0-27523";"Help! Everything's in chaos. The sacred brew is in danger!"
"165399380-0-27529";"My tale nears its end. I pray to Y'ffre it goes well.\n\nBut there could be a dark ending. Silvenar is closed against me."
"165399380-0-27535";"Get back! Wait, you're no stinking Reachman. \n\nWhere did you come from?"
"165399380-0-27539";"We've been busy questioning our prisoner. Did you find what you came for?"
"165399380-0-27547";"Get out of here! There's Gray Vipers to the East. They catch you, you'll be picking apples for them too."
"165399380-0-27548";"Don't bother me. I don't fill up enough baskets with apples, I don't eat today. Go away."
"165399380-0-27552";"Rumor says the Worm Cult infests Taarengrav."
"165399380-0-27557";"Stop, stranger! Come no closer, or I'll carve you apart.\n\nState your business, or be on your way."
"165399380-0-27561";"It gets tiring being holed up in here all day long. A shame when you walk into the sunlight and burn to death.\n\nMakes taking a stroll that much more exciting I suppose."
"165399380-0-27562";"An outsider? Jaruk has not seen one in many years. Outsiders tend to be afraid of us.\n\nCome, pull up a seat. Let us entertain you. It's not like we're going anywhere, heh."
"165399380-0-27590";"My friend. Fond greetings will have to wait."
"165399380-0-27592";"<<1>> didn't like how the Ra Gada treated him, but at least he's in one piece!\n\nThank you for saving him. I … I don't know what I'd do without him."
"165399380-0-27593";"I found some new dresses amongst the Ra Gada's possessions. Hope some of them fit me."
"165399380-0-27601";"We fled Hackdirt with only what we could carry. The little food we had is almost gone. We are not hunters; how will we survive?"
"165399380-0-27602";"The Black Daggers roared into Hackdirt like a swift tide over mudflats, sweeping all before them. Only we few escaped their wrath."
"165399380-0-27603";"Everyone here's given up. They're just waiting to die. They all make me sick."
"165399380-0-27604";"I can't seem to move. I just think about my husband and our son. I'll never see them again. Why am I still alive?"
"165399380-0-27605";"Why are you talking to me? Enemies are in the Hall!"
"165399380-0-27606";"What'll we do now?"
"165399380-0-27610";"My tale nears its end. I pray to Y'ffre it goes well."
"165399380-0-27611";"The Maormer savages will die for this!"
"165399380-0-27612";"Welcome to the Withered Tree. What would you like to end your drought?\n\nNo, I don't think it's clever either. The owner makes me say it."
"165399380-0-27616";"Thank you!"
"165399380-0-27619";"There are too many wounded!"
"165399380-0-27626";"Are you really going to help us take back the mine? That would be so great!"
"165399380-0-27662";"Don't sit here and talk to me, we've got enemies crawling across the countryside!"
"165399380-0-27670";"I broke another one! Cultists die too quickly!"
"165399380-0-27676";"Rumors proclaim that the Ebonheart Pact is having a secret meeting here. Why that should hinder humble travelers, though, is beyond me.\n\nWe've been on the road for so long!"
"165399380-0-27677";"We've been traveling for days now, trying to escape the Stormfist Brigade and their Orc raiders to the west.\n\nWe finally arrive at a safe place, and they turn us away."
"165399380-0-27678";"They say we are allies, friends. But when we need a place to rest, we're turned away!\n\n""Important business,"" they say. ""The inn is full."" Rubbish! It's because we're not Nords!"
"165399380-0-27686";"Welcome to Windhelm! You are just in time for powerful party! Powerful party!"
"165399380-0-27687";"Listen, if you're part of this group, I already explained this a dozen times. Feel free to enter Fort Amol, but the inn is full. There's no more room.\n\nAnd the Jarl's keep is off limits, too, of course."
"165399380-0-27689";"So few … ah, but it's good to finally see them again!"
"165399380-0-27691";"<<1>> and <<2>> were killed as we secured this exit. They will be buried with honor.\n\nThank you for saving the captain, my friend. We couldn't have done this without you."
"165399380-0-27692";"Swords are vulgar weapons. Edherien is blinded by how shiny they are."
"165399380-0-27693";"We Bosmer must learn swordplay, regardless of what Elphiniel thinks."
"165399380-0-27694";"You'd be surprised how much wood these Bosmer buy. They can't harvest it themselves, so this one makes a fortune."
"165399380-0-27697";"Cold … cold … since the accident, always so cold.\n\nOh! I didn't see you there."
"165399380-0-27698";"Edherien and Elphiniel are always arguing. I come out here just to hear myself think!"
"165399380-0-27704";"I can't wait until they get the meadery back up and running."
"165399380-0-27705";"After we report this, Thalmor warships will return and burn these bastards to ash for what they've done.\n\nLive with honor, my friend, and remember the fallen."
"165399380-0-27706";"<<1>> mentored me from my first days at sea. I will do my best to pass on his wisdom and traditions to his children.\n\nThank you for all you've done for us."
"165399380-0-27707";"Many good mer lost their lives to the Maormer in the attack. When we return, we'll scour the beaches and caves clean of their filth."
"165399380-0-27708";"Honor and praise, my friend. You've may very well have saved the Thalmor fleet with this rescue."
"165399380-0-27709";"I surprised a few of those Maormer bastards along the path up here. Now that we're all armed, we'll be fine.\n\nThank you for the assistance. May Auriel guide your blades in battle."
"165399380-0-27713";"Where's that lazy skeever? I'm going to kill ….\n\nWhat do you want? Someone steal your gold pouch or something?"
"165399380-0-27714";"Go away. I'm busy."
"165399380-0-27715";"I hope the Silvenar returns soon. The Green Lady needs him."
"165399380-0-27716";"I hope the Silvenar returns soon."
"165399380-0-27726";"The Green Lady needs the Silvenar to return."
"165399380-0-27736";"Bosmer are to be admired for their resourcefulness. Even in Shadowfen do they speak of the rotmeth. \n\nI am here to ensure this remains true."
"165399380-0-27737";"Bosmer drink strange things. I'm all for a well cooked steak. I'll even eat bugs! But throwing all that in a mammoth skin to rot for years on end?\n\nI'll stick with jagga."
"165399380-0-27738";"Up in the morning, down at night. Morning comes, they're up again!\n\nThe trees are ready for a fight. Watch where you step! They do …"
"165399380-0-27739";"The tales of Nords and their mead drinking are legendary, but Jeggi here. He's absolutely epic.\n\nHe's been drinking for two days straight now. Two days!"
"165399380-0-27740";"Oh yes, Naryu …. Whatever you say, Naryu …."
"165399380-0-27741";"Hello my excellent friend. Thank you for joining me on this auspicious occasion!"
"165399380-0-27744";"What a gathering of diverse troops! Nords and Dark Elves and Argonians, side by side and all together!\n\nJust let the Stormfists try to cause trouble here. They wouldn't stand a chance."
"165399380-0-27746";"These fools didn't even see it coming."
"165399380-0-27748";"Where? This body. This isn't my body!"
"165399380-0-27752";"I've always been fond of this overlook."
"165399380-0-27772";"Can't a man walk ten feet without being harassed every step of the way?\n\nLeave me to my business, please."
"165399380-0-27773";"The Maormer will pay for this!"
"165399380-0-27776";"Don't come near me! I'll gut you if you touch me!"
"165399380-0-27814";"Fancy meeting you out this way. So far from the crowds. Now run along while you still can."
"165399380-0-27816";"Back off! If you're with these monsters, I'll slice you open!"
"165399380-0-27817";"It's about time you arrived."
"165399380-0-27835";"Welcome back, my most excellent friend! How goes the hunt?"
"165399380-0-27838";"Why are you bothering me?\n\nI'll need to speak to my guards about letting every peasant disturb us."
"165399380-0-27841";"A gathering! A feast! A time to drink!\n\nWho am I kidding? It's always time to drink!"
"165399380-0-27842";"Prince Irnskar must emulate the wolves and find his inner peace. If not, he may undo all of his father's hard work."
"165399380-0-27843";"I must apologize. If you seek the King, he's currently busy within the city and cannot receive visitors. He has important matters to deal with, as you can well imagine."
"165399380-0-27848";"She's caught, I'm sure of it! Held in the Worm Cult's festering pits. We've got to rescue her!"
"165399380-0-27867";"If Gelds sent you over here to have me fetch something, tell him to go jump in the river."
"165399380-0-27868";"I told them to leave me if I were captured, but Y'ffre bless them for not listening."
"165399380-0-27869";"Why hold a summit in such a frigid place? You want our respect? Come to Mournhold and dine like real nobles. Don't send us on a damn camping trip."
"165399380-0-27870";"Did you know? It's pronounced Con-un-leekar, not Corn-loon-licker. I feel so silly now!"
"165399380-0-27871";"Thanks for helping me back there. I don't want to think about what those rieklings were going to do to me."
"165399380-0-27878";"We meet in dark times."
"165399380-0-27879";"Another of Aera's guardians? Save your breath. I refuse to run. If Betar-Nes was the best the Worm Cult can send against me, I have little to fear."
"165399380-0-27880";"Let me guess: you're looking for Worm Cultists, right?"
"165399380-0-27881";"<Golun was stabbed repeatedly until he died. A faintly glowing object is scarcely visible beneath him, as though he'd tried to hide it.>"
"165399380-0-27883";"You look familiar. You're one of Sergeant Aera's friends, aren't you?"
"165399380-0-27884";"What a peaceful, lazy day. It's perfect."
"165399380-0-27892";"These damn cats follow us everywhere!\n\nIt's like they've never seen an Argonian before. Why do the Nords keep so many cats around? You'd think they were the Khajiit."
"165399380-0-27893";"I never imagined how exciting this could be!"
"165399380-0-27927";"The Arrow of the King! You're most welcome."
"165399380-0-27934";"Ready?"
"165399380-0-27938";"This bond is as much your work as anyone's.\n\nThe Green Lady and the Silvenar will celebrate for some time, expressing their joy in many ways. Still, I am certain they can make time for you."
"165399380-0-27971";"Shandi has much to do, much to do. Rhymes don't find their own way into words, no."
"165399380-0-27973";"<A skeleton lies here. Whatever armaments it may have worn at one time are gone, but a journal remains behind.>"
"165399380-0-27977";"Stop staring and close your mouth or I'll call a guard."
"165399380-0-27978";"Well, hello there."
"165399380-0-27979";"Nice to see a friendly face around here."
"165399380-0-27980";"Who knew that war mostly consists of sitting around and waiting for something to happen? I was promised action!"
"165399380-0-27997";"Just because I'm not a soldier doesn't mean I can't defend myself. I am a Nord, after all."
"165399380-0-27998";"Oh, hello. Are you here to see my grandfather?"
"165399380-0-28001";"You're fortunate I intervened."
"165399380-0-28002";"The camp is on high alert. Watch your step. You wouldn't want a Pact soldier to mistake you for one of those Stormfist brutes."
"165399380-0-28003";"Finally! I've escaped that snake-infested mud-hole they call a city. Stormhold's no city; it's the only dryland to speak of south of Deshaan.\n\nSuch a wretched pit with no culture."
"165399380-0-28005";"You don't find a hero of the Pact on your doorstep without a reason. What brings you to a backwater like Fullhelm?"
"165399380-0-28006";"I hate all this sitting around and waiting."
"165399380-0-28026";"Pinooh is always happy to meet new people."
"165399380-0-28029";"The General appreciates my cooking. But that harlot of his … she's demanding and rude. Not to mention over-dressed."
"165399380-0-28047";"I'm worried about my twin brother, Thalm. \n\nHe's down there with those stinking Stormfists. Not a true Nord in the bunch. Not a one!"
"165399380-0-28048";"Be quiet. I don't want them to notice you—or me, either, for that matter."
"165399380-0-28053";"We've been overwhelmed by Reachmen led by a Ghost Giant!"
"165399380-0-28055";"Go away. I don't want them to hurt my husband, Ogmann. If they see us talking, they're liable to kill him."
"165399380-0-28056";"Thank you for helping us. I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't come by."
"165399380-0-28057";"I need to keep busy or I'll worry so. I don't like these Stormfist thugs. Don't like them a bit."
"165399380-0-28058";"Leave me alone! Do you want the Stormfists to come over and chop my hand off?\n\nThey'll do it. Or worse! I've seen how cruel they can be."
"165399380-0-28059";"My younger brother, Holguss, is in the mine. I promised our parents that I'd look after him, but I never should have let him follow me from Windhelm."
"165399380-0-28060";"Can't talk. Very busy. Leave me alone."
"165399380-0-28061";"Stupid Fildgor. He thought he could just force us to help him.\n\nHa! We showed him."
"165399380-0-28063";"I feel so helpless. I wish there was something I could do that wouldn't just make the Stormfists angry."
"165399380-0-28064";"It feels good to have those rotten Stormfist thugs out of our hair. Thanks!"
"165399380-0-28065";"My wife toils away in the mine while I stand here and wait for my stew to boil. What a life!"
"165399380-0-28066";"Hjolard sad. All my friends are gone."
"165399380-0-28067";"You're fortunate I intervened."
"165399380-0-28068";"This isn't the best time to visit Lost Knife Cave, traveler."
"165399380-0-28071";"Greetings, Master Drenduf. As always, your memories are alive in me. How may I serve?"
"165399380-0-28072";"I need help. Things haven't been normal for a long time."
"165399380-0-28073";"The cultists. They came out of nowhere. Aera. She was leading them!  She demanded I join the cult. \n\nSurprised … surprised her."
"165399380-0-28078";"Resilient. Determined. I like you. I take it you've dealt with my would-be assassin?"
"165399380-0-28079";"Told you something bad was going to happen.\n\nI wasn't going to let you walk into this trap alone. So I followed you."
"165399380-0-28080";"We've been overwhelmed by Reachmen led by a Ghost Giant!"
"165399380-0-28082";"<Examine the corpse.>"
"165399380-0-28086";"Told you something bad was going to happen.\n\nI wasn't going to let you walk into this trap alone. So I followed you."
"165399380-0-28126";"Work is so much better without Fildgor's ruffians standing over us."
"165399380-0-28127";"I'm going to kill that old Dunmer. He's probably laughing, enjoying a drink, thinking me dead."
"165399380-0-28139";"Thank you for all your hard work here in Fort Amol.\n\nI can't say that Vurlop was as useful as I'd hoped, but he served his purpose, right? I mean, just look at me! Stunning, am I not? A Breton leading the Nords. Who would have thought of it?"
"165399380-0-28141";"My sturdy little assistant! Where have you been?"
"165399380-0-28148";"The trick is to look busy and not draw attention to yourself."
"165399380-0-28149";"Isn't <<1>> just charming? He's seen so much, yet he told me he's never seen anything so beautiful as … as …. \n\nOur fort. Er … excuse me."
"165399380-0-28154";"King Jorunn's breathing is shallow. The poison Dhalen used. It's tainted. Daedric.\n\nI'm not sure what it's doing to this poor man, but I don't think he will survive."
"165399380-0-28155";"I can't believe the Stormfists had the audacity to disrupt this proceeding and attack the Nord king. Their actions are so … undignified."
"165399380-0-28157";"Where's my father? What did our so-called allies do to him?\n\nI'll kill every single Argonian and Dark Elf myself if my father's been harmed!"
"165399380-0-28169";"This is not the best time to visit Lost Knife Cave."
"165399380-0-28171";"My twin brother, Thalm, is safe and sound. Thanks for helping him."
"165399380-0-28172";"I hope the trolls stay in the west dig. We have enough problems as it is."
"165399380-0-28173";"I've hidden weapons around the mine, just in case Fildgor's goons come back. We won't get caught with our pants down again!"
"165399380-0-28174";"I'm glad that's over. I don't think Fildgor's fools ever realized how little we actually produced for them."
"165399380-0-28176";"Can you distract Ganthis Fancypants so my brother and I can sneak off to get a drink? There's not much mead in Shadowfen, and what the Argonians drink … well, I'd rather taste rotmeth.\n\nNo? Oh, well."
"165399380-0-28178";"My brother <<1>> and I haven't broken anyone's bones in days.\n\nHe gets twitchy. Don't bother him."
"165399380-0-28193";"News from Vernim Wood!"
"165399380-0-28198";"Be careful if you're going through to Treehenge. The spriggans have been on guard ever since the Worm Cult's invaded. \n\nI haven't been able to convince them to let anyone pass. If I don't get to the grove soon, it'll be too late."
"165399380-0-28203";"Yes, I'm Haraldar's sister. Mother demanded at least one female to help even things up a bit back home.\n\nI'm happy to see the meadery up and running again. We'll do our best to live up to the Voljar family's standards."
"165399380-0-28211";"Don't sit here and chat. Our enemies are everywhere!"
"165399380-0-28233";"You did great work today. Thank you."
"165399380-0-28234";"Know what I like to do? Fish!"
"165399380-0-28235";"Feels good to remove my helm for awhile. I can't stand helm hair."
"165399380-0-28237";"Have you seen all the Pact soldiers? Fort Amol is crawling with them!\n\nAnd do you know what that means? My till is full!"
"165399380-0-28241";"So many new people to meet. So little time."
"165399380-0-28242";"Fort Amol sure is busy. The inn needs lots of mead and wine."
"165399380-0-28247";"What … what do they put in that meat? Meal? Mead? Mead! It's so yummy!"
"165399380-0-28249";"This mead's going to give me a headache. It'll be massive. I'm sure of it. But first, I'm going to get very, very drunk. \n\nYou should join me."
"165399380-0-28250";"Nothing like a crowded inn full of good food, good drink, and good company to bind the Pact together."
"165399380-0-28251";"These Stormfists and their Orc allies are starting to get on my nerves. They better give us the order to attack soon or I might have to deal with this situation in my own way."
"165399380-0-28253";"I really only know four chords, but no one seems to mind."
"165399380-0-28261";"You've done well. Now that the sphere is safe, we can mop up what remains of these dungy Sea Vipers.\n\nThe Thalmor thank you for your assistance."
"165399380-0-28265";"The Nords are an interesting people. Always drinking. Always fighting. Always happy.\n\nIt makes me wonder what's wrong with Fildgor Orcthane."
"165399380-0-28280";"These soldiers don't appreciate my music. They'd rather sing along to bawdy drinking songs. I wish I knew some."
"165399380-0-28281";"Even officers need to relax every now and then. And an inn! The last place my troops camped was cold, hostile, and barren. And we ran out of mead."
"165399380-0-28282";"Glad you're back. We've got a little problem."
"165399380-0-28284";"There's got to be a clue here somewhere."
"165399380-0-28285";"I find that quiet contemplation helps me prepare for battle."
"165399380-0-28286";"<Her body appears to have been mauled by an animal.>"
"165399380-0-28288";"<This Nord male appears to have been stabbed to death.>"
"165399380-0-28314";"We must hurry."
"165399380-0-28316";"Shor preserve us! Help!"
"165399380-0-28318";"Please! I couldn't stop him!"
"165399380-0-28320";"Please! I couldn't stop him!"
"165399380-0-28332";"Your courage and compassion are welcome, but I fear it's far too late for anything to be done."
"165399380-0-28347";"I need to keep my skills sharp, but that tree isn't a very challenging target. It doesn't move or shoot back or anything."
"165399380-0-28348";"A newcomer, eh? I hope you'll stay for dinner."
"165399380-0-28355";"Welcome to Windhelm and to the finest stable in the city! We also run the best inn, if that's what you're looking for. It's right over there."
"165399380-0-28356";"Sure, we have the best stable, but you're better off at the Sober Nord. It's much nicer than our place."
"165399380-0-28359";"What can you tell me about Nord mating rituals? I'm not sure how to respond to some of the things Innbild has been suggesting."
"165399380-0-28360";"That Nurara sure is great! Did you see how I impressed her?"
"165399380-0-28375";"Welcome to the Cold Moon Inn. We only attract the lowest class of customers. No offense."
"165399380-0-28377";"What?"
"165399380-0-28381";"I continue to work on my masterpiece. The one song that will win the heart of the woman I can't live without.\n\nShe'll surely swoon and accept my hand in marriage the moment she hears it. I … just need to finish it first."
"165399380-0-28387";"Were you able to catch Thorulf?"
"165399380-0-28389";"A grim day. Who could have seen this coming?"
"165399380-0-28392";"Stay back. I know what I have to do."
"165399380-0-28394";"Stay back. I know what I have to do."
"165399380-0-28397";"Grandfather is himself again. I can hear it in his voice. We owe you a great deal."
"165399380-0-28406";"What happened? I heard a terrible commotion from below.\n\nDid he—is my brother dead?"
"165399380-0-28429";"Hi there! I'm Undead Green Flavor Clippy!"
"165399380-0-28438";"Furu's been leading us around for weeks now. She keeps promising she'll find us a new home and some work so we can settle down.\n\nIf promises were gold, we'd be wealthy misers by now!"
"165399380-0-28445";"I'm learning how to use my brains!"
"165399380-0-28446";"Nice to see you, friend!"
"165399380-0-28447";"Hey, man."
"165399380-0-28454";"Well met! Let me buy you a drink, my newfound friend."
"165399380-0-28455";"If you need something, please talk to Master Benus. I have a lot of work to do today."
"165399380-0-28466";"I do not want more trouble. It's bad for business. And business is often trouble enough, yes?"
"165399380-0-28470";"Please, stay and browse. If something catches your fancy, Jainda will put it aside for you."
"165399380-0-28471";"Brother says I'm too small to fight. I'll show him. I'll wet my claws on his blood!"
"165399380-0-28472";"This one feels a storm brewing. My fur's standing on end. Hurts my old joints to be up and about.\n\nBest stay inside until it passes, kitten."
"165399380-0-28473";"You'd think my kitten brother had learned after a few cuffings. Stubborn takes a lot of licks to beat out of the young ones."
"165399380-0-28474";"Hrr, what'sit want from Fazaddu? No more room, no more. Bring more sugar next time."
"165399380-0-28475";"Greetings, honored one. I trust your travels have been pleasant?"
"165399380-0-28476";"You talk to the girls, that's fine. You want more, you talk to me."
"165399380-0-28477";"When I asked for a room, I wasn't expecting a mat and some linens. Ah, well. My time of riches is far behind me."
"165399380-0-28478";"No caravans, no kids. Protection is extra.\n\nWant me to kill an Orc? It'll cost you more … but I'll kill Elves for free."
"165399380-0-28479";"I work all day, then they yell at me for napping. Jainda's tongue is too quick to lash.\n\nShe probably needs a nap too."
"165399380-0-28490";"Fighting only hurts those that cannot defend themselves. And with the troubles the Houndsmen have brought about, I thought it was wise to prepare.\n\nI see now that I may have been … mistaken."
"165399380-0-28507";"Get out of here, I'm busy."
"165399380-0-28512";"Spare a coin for a stranded traveler, friend?"
"165399380-0-28513";"If <<1>> asks for gold, don't give him any. \n\nHe's got this crazy idea that he's a stranded traveler. He's lived here all his life! Too much sugar for that one."
"165399380-0-28514";"Is it time for feasting yet? I'm starving!"
"165399380-0-28515";"This place is a mess! Maybe you've got time to wander about, but we've work to do!"
"165399380-0-28516";"Silvenar, Green Lady … who cares? Our city's in shambles because of them."
"165399380-0-28517";"I'm not usually a gossip, but when you hear about Dunmer in Malabal Tor, it's hard not to talk."
"165399380-0-28520";"Never trust a Dark Elf. My mother said their skin is a reflection of their soul."
"165399380-0-28521";"Praise the Silvenar! Praise the Green Lady! Pass the rotmeth!"
"165399380-0-28522";"Nothing like a feast after a hard-fought battle."
"165399380-0-28535";"All that fighting works up my appetite. I could eat a whole roast mammoth leg, bone and all!"
"165399380-0-28536";"Hope you're not here to buy eggs. This celebration's all but cleaned me out!"
"165399380-0-28537";"I've brought everything to the celebration! Well, what little the Hound didn't devour."
"165399380-0-28538";"Fortunately, the Houndsmen didn't destroy all my stock!"
"165399380-0-28539";"I know all the best songs. And if I don't, I make them up."
"165399380-0-28543";"There's nothing like fresh meat washed down with aged rotmeth! This is the best posting I've ever had with the Guild!"
"165399380-0-28544";"You have business with the Guild, hrr?"
"165399380-0-28546";"Not right now. I'm much too busy to talk."
"165399380-0-28559";"I've visited every known Ayleid well in Cyrodiil, yet I still have no clue as to how they work or why they exist. The Ayleid culture was so interesting … aside from the slavery, torture, and cruelty, of course."
"165399380-0-28578";"There was a scream and the sound of fighting. When we arrived, Golun was dead. It happened so fast."
"165399380-0-28588";"You're safe! I thought Boethiah meant to destroy you too. Glad I was wrong."
"165399380-0-28589";"You stopped the ritual, praise Y'ffre!\n\nThe Worm Cult failed to summon Mauloch! One less Daedric Prince for Malabal Tor to worry about now."
"165399380-0-28611";"My prayers are answered!\n\nPlease, lend me your talents for a time. My comrades have been captured."
"165399380-0-28612";"Please, I require assistance. Maormer attacked our ship, and captured some of the crew."
"165399380-0-28634";"There's something wrong across the river. Trolls! They don't usually get this close to major settlements.\n\nI hope they don't decide to come over here."
"165399380-0-28635";"Darkwater, across the river, is crawling with trolls. The poor Argonians that were living there probably ended up as troll food.\n\nI can't think of a worse way to go than that."
"165399380-0-28643";"Nice weather, eh? For the season, I mean."
"165399380-0-28675";"You handled yourself pretty well in the caves. Impressive work.\n\nWe'll be fine, now that the captain's safe again."
"165399380-0-28692";"The Stormfists have been dealt with and the duplicates rounded up.\n\nBut whatever poison attacks the King grows worse with each passing hour. We can't help him without more information."
"165399380-0-28706";"Those who give the orders, whether intended or not, can alter any outcome."
"165399380-0-28707";"Shor's blood! You're a serious one, aren't you? Why not stop and enjoy the springs with us?"
"165399380-0-28729";"What?"
"165399380-0-28731";"<The sabre cat-mauled corpse of the Worm Cultist is settling into the mud. It will be devoured by scavengers before long.>"
"165399380-0-28735";"Velyn Harbor's being overrun. We have to do something!"
"165399380-0-28736";"The Ra Gada came out of nowhere! Velyn Harbor is under attack!"
"165399380-0-28737";"Velyn Harbor's usually safe. Why'd they attack now?"
"165399380-0-28738";"Meow?"
"165399380-0-28749";"We fled Darkwater Crossing when the trolls attacked. If not for Stormy-Eyes, we wouldn't have found this place."
"165399380-0-28750";"We were sleeping. There was a rumble and some shouting.\n\nNext thing I know, Pulls there grabs my arm and yells that we have to go. Those trolls. They almost got us."
"165399380-0-28751";"All my supplies, my stock of goods. All smashed by some oaf of a troll! I'm ruined!"
"165399380-0-28752";"I don't have a lot left, but I split my supplies with the rest of the camp."
"165399380-0-28753";"The Skald-King. Bah! He gave us Darkwater Crossing and what good did it do us?\n\nHe probably knew the trolls were coming. Probably sent them our way!"
"165399380-0-28754";"Stormy-Eyes, he's special. We owe our lives to him a dozen times over."
"165399380-0-28755";"This one is ready now. As mud is my mother, no trolls shall pass."
"165399380-0-28756";"The King has been good to us, and we're grateful. We came here after the Aldmeri attacks on our land and the King gave us Darkwater Crossing. Even helped us rebuild it.\n\nI just wish he had provided soldiers to protect us, though."
"165399380-0-28757";"<The body of a dead Worm Cultist.>"
"165399380-0-28759";"Sister-of-Wind was injured when the trolls attacked. She's still unconscious and I'm worried about her.\n\nStormy thinks he can save her, but he needs supplies that were left behind when we fled."
"165399380-0-28760";"Too much to do and too little time."
"165399380-0-28764";"Yes?"
"165399380-0-28766";"Laughs has what you need to slick your crest or spin your tail."
"165399380-0-28767";"The Lieutenant died for Velyn Harbor. We should remember his sacrifice.\n\nIn his name, I think I can help out a little more, too."
"165399380-0-28769";"I never thought we'd have to take up arms ourselves to protect Velyn Harbor, but the city's worth it!"
"165399380-0-28770";"It's been a long time since I've handled a weapon."
"165399380-0-28799";"Who dares?"
"165399380-0-28834";"Nice to see you again, friend. Have you tried the mead? I didn't think Roruld could do it, but I'm happy to say I was wrong."
"165399380-0-28845";"Dralof found this amazing hot spring. It really opens the pores."
"165399380-0-28846";"Isn't it nice out here? The water's so warm and bubbly!\n\nTake off your armor and soak with us."
"165399380-0-28848";"You're back! Did you get the bath salts?"
"165399380-0-28849";"Did you bring the bath salts? They say they make the water tingle!"
"165399380-0-28850";"You're still dressed? The hot water can't do its thing if you don't jump in!"
"165399380-0-28854";"Let's finish this!"
"165399380-0-28869";"Poor Sister! I've never seen such terrible injuries!\n\nStormy said that everything would be all right. Told me to sit and rest. I hope he can really save her!"
"165399380-0-28873";"Did you bring the items I requested?"
"165399380-0-28887";"Hey, you! You're awake, yeah?"
"165399380-0-28905";"The spirits told me you were close.\n\nI spoke to the Ternion monks. They admitted the King and the Prince, but not me. I left the fold. They remember that. But they will help the King."
"165399380-0-28909";"I'm glad to see a friendly face.\n\nYou are friendly, right?"
"165399380-0-28913";"I'm searching for ingredients for a potion. It will make me grow a full, flowing beard. Just like my father's."
"165399380-0-28914";"If you follow this road, you'll cross into the Rift."
"165399380-0-28915";"Did you hear that Bleakrock was hit hard by the Daggerfall Covenant? I have family out that way. I hope they're safe."
"165399380-0-28917";"You made it back. And you're not bleeding, frozen, or gibbering! Damn sight better than those Cultists, eh? \n\nAndrin's people will help me back to Riften. And then, mead, lots of it."
"165399380-0-28918";"People claim many things. Some claim to be the best gamblers. Others the best lovers.\n\nMe? I'm the best hunter you'll ever meet. No question about it. I've never lost a hunting competition. Not a one."
"165399380-0-28919";"The lizard mocks me. I'm the best hunter in Eastmarch, but he shows up and out hunts me. Twelve rabbits! I need to figure out his secret."
"165399380-0-28924";"Steady-Hand swears he's the best hunter in Eastmarch. Says he can nab more rabbits in a minute than anyone else.\n\nI've got an idea, if you don't mind bending the rules a bit. Come back and talk to me after you equip the hunting bow."
"165399380-0-28943";"I'm staying, no matter how bad things get. Mark my words, 500 years from now, there'll still be Dorans in Chorrol."
"165399380-0-28944";"Every tremor brings another piece of my house down around my ears. I hear there's a portal to Oblivion at the bottom of the fissure!"
"165399380-0-28945";"I don't care if the fissure and earthquakes are punishments from the gods. Not even they can chase the Motierres from Chorrol!"
"165399380-0-28965";"A customer! Welcome, how can I help you?"
"165399380-0-28971";"Thank you for getting me out of there."
"165399380-0-28974";"Just when things were going so well, all this had to happen."
"165399380-0-28982";"The balance of the world tilts precariously and the gates of the dead shiver in anticipation.\n\nThe Daedric Prince succeeds at his unholy task. This pocket proves that."
"165399380-0-28986";"No one expects an Altmer to enjoy fighting, but I can change their minds."
"165399380-0-28987";"Though the ground shakes and fumes taint the air, Harzad is here to help."
"165399380-0-28988";"Can you help me? Please!"
"165399380-0-28993";"Welcome to Weynon Priory, friend. In these troubled times, helping hands are welcome."
"165399380-0-28994";"If you've come to join the Quickstep Bandits, you're too late. The Black Daggers killed my whole gang. But they'll pay, if it's the last thing I do!"
"165399380-0-28999";"I don't see that bard fellow with you. Did those creatures kill him?"
"165399380-0-29010";"Who are you? Z'en! What've we done?"
"165399380-0-29011";"Gods, let it not be my time yet!"
"165399380-0-29013";"""Don't trust the Orcs,"" I said. But did they listen?\n\nNow they're dead, all dead."
"165399380-0-29019";"It isn't enough to drive the Drublog back to the forest. We have to kill them all!"
"165399380-0-29020";"The Drublog have taken too much from us! We have to start taking from them."
"165399380-0-29039";"Z'en, have you abandoned us?"
"165399380-0-29040";"What's the purpose of all this, if Z'en won't protect us in our time of need?"
"165399380-0-29041";"I told them not to forsake Y'ffre for Z'en! I told them!\n\nThat's why I'm still alive. I put my trust and faith in Y'ffre."
"165399380-0-29086";"Don't believe a soldier's life is all fame and glory. Taking a life isn't heroic.\n\nYour enemy has a family, just like you and … like I did. No one deserves to die. No one."
"165399380-0-29116";"If I have to comb through the Worm Cult's filth to find her, I'll strangle her with my bare hands."
"165399380-0-29119";"Please, don't interrupt my meditation."
"165399380-0-29120";"The Worm Cult! Y'ffre help us. What are they doing here?"
"165399380-0-29133";"How goes the search?"
"165399380-0-29135";"How goes the search?"
"165399380-0-29153";"I'm currently well employed, friend, and not taking requests."
"165399380-0-29175";"Fair day, traveler. Best steer clear of here. Vernim wood is not safe."
"165399380-0-29176";"You'll want to steer clear. Danger on the road ahead."
"165399380-0-29218";"Thank you for helping us …."
"165399380-0-29247";"We all walk the river's edge. What do you see on your journey?"
"165399380-0-29249";"I traveled many days to commune with the Hist. I cannot wait to begin the trials."
"165399380-0-29250";"Looking to taste what's come down the river? Or brew your own?"
"165399380-0-29251";"You're clearly a person with a refined palate. Interest you in some swamp cuisine?"
"165399380-0-29252";"I failed. I failed the Trial of the Heart. To have come so far to fail. Why?"
"165399380-0-29253";"Which trial do you look forward to? I cannot wait to partake, and have my mind judged by the Hist."
"165399380-0-29255";"I was to partake in the Trials. And then that Dominion soldier showed up. The Hist speaks with a High Elf! Pah!"
"165399380-0-29256";"Don't let the river knock you around, friend. Toughen up those scales."
"165399380-0-29257";"Looking to hit something? Trust me, I understand."
"165399380-0-29348";"Canonreeve Valano, at your service."
"165399380-0-29368";"Just trying to keep folks happy, you know? Have any requests?"
"165399380-0-29369";"I can't go back to the lines. So much blood and death. I can't do it."
"165399380-0-29370";"Hard to keep warm here. Even harder when your man is on the front lines."
"165399380-0-29524";"Sinmur is alive again …  how can this be? How can we fight this monster?"
"165399380-0-29525";"Now we know what the Reach were here for—reviving that monster Sinmur. The bastards."
"165399380-0-29530";"<Yiri says nothing.>"
"165399380-0-29532";"Please, let the poor girl be. She just lost her father."
"165399380-0-29618";"It's rude to interrupt someone while they're eating! Hmm, or is it the other way around?"
"165399380-0-29619";"Ever wrestle a mammoth? It ain't pretty."
"165399380-0-29620";"A dull blade will betray you. Care for your weapons as you'd care for a lover, and they will both stay true."
"165399380-0-29621";"People think that manipulating magical energy is easy. You and I know nothing could be farther from the truth."
"165399380-0-29622";"I'm working on an alchemical recipe for a self-silencing spell.\n\nFirst test subject will be my fool brother. I'm so tired of his bellyaching!"
"165399380-0-29638";"I heard tell of honest work in these parts. I've no want to turn to brigandry as long as there's work to be had."
"165399380-0-29639";"Another local. How lucky I must be today."
"165399380-0-29640";"The ground yields to one's step here, not like those parched lands up north. It reminds me of my home, far from here. Good memories and bad."
"165399380-0-29641";"Blessings of the Eight upon you. You … do know of the Eight in this land. Don't you?\n\nAh, Stendarr, how you send me almost too many burdens to bear."
"165399380-0-29650";"This is humilating. I was hoping for a little decency, but these Hlaalu savages have trussed me up like a spit roast.\n\nI suppose it's better than being impaled on a Dwemer sphere's blade."
"165399380-0-29656";"Blah ablh"
"165399380-0-29660";"You'll need more than claws to get through well-forged armor. A small sword in between the cracks does the job in half the time!"
"165399380-0-29665";"What's done once will be done again."
"165399380-0-29666";"There is strength in you, to do what must be done."
"165399380-0-29670";"I don't care how thick your skull is—everybody needs a strong helm. Gotta protect our pretty faces, eh?"
"165399380-0-29672";"Many years I have traveled, in search of the finest luxuries!\n\nHave you ever lain on a rug that once graced the steps of the White-Gold Tower? Or drank from a cup forged in the bowels of Ash Mountain?"
"165399380-0-29679";"I saw her head toward the water."
"165399380-0-29680";"She went into the crypt …."
"165399380-0-29683";"This will be a celebration to remember!"
"165399380-0-29684";"So. You're the one who's working with this beast?\n\nFunny. You look familiar somehow."
"165399380-0-29702";"Did you hear my singing? I'm certain all of Silvenar heard me!"
"165399380-0-29703";"We did it! We played at the handfasting! I hope this makes Dadazi happy."
"165399380-0-29704";"This is just one small step. First the handfast, then … well, I don't know what comes next, but it'll be great!"
"165399380-0-29705";"Again, I must thank you! We got to perform at the handfast because of you!"
"165399380-0-29710";"My da's starving, and I'm too weak to hunt. I just need a few coins to buy some food. Something to get me back on my feet."
"165399380-0-29712";"Kind stranger will bless Halarel with a favor, no? Some scraps, or a sweetroll? My belly needs medicine, before it goes into knots again."
"165399380-0-29713";"Which do you like better—the drummer, or the flautist? I'm partial to the dancer, myself. Very provocative."
"165399380-0-29716";"That is my sister dancing. She hopes to perform in Elden Root one day.\n\nI think maybe they are not ready for our kind of dancing."
"165399380-0-29738";"Don't waste my time, if you know what's good for you."
"165399380-0-29739";"A fair day to you, friend. Care to try your strength against mine?\n\nI may not look like much, but in Morrowind, I arm-wrestled many a Nord warrior to his knees!"
"165399380-0-29740";"Ah, a fellow traveler. If you wish, I can relate some of my adventures to you. I've been told they are quite exciting.\n\nI'm a storyteller by trade, you see. Words are my instrument."
"165399380-0-29741";"Some say Khajiit cannot retract their claws. It is not so.\n\nI am skilled in massaging away the hardest knots. My warm pads will melt your cares away, friend."
"165399380-0-29742";"Are you the mercenary we've heard so much about?\n\nI am skilled in the ways of the harp. Shall I strum a tune to relax your sore muscles?"
"165399380-0-29743";"This dress is ridiculous! How can I cook a decent meal in this?\n\nWell, if you're interested in Bosmer cuisine, let me know. I'll change into something more practical."
"165399380-0-29744";"Finally. I thought I'd be paid for nothing. I warmed up my steps just in case, worry not.\n\nWhat kind of dancing do you need? I'm versed in the rotes of many cultures."
"165399380-0-29745";"Well. This is quite a pickle I've gotten myself into.\n\nI've been hoodwinked into this. The cat outside said I couldn't leave until everyone else left. Whatever indignity you're here to inflict, let's make it quick."
"165399380-0-29746";"I don't have all day to be waitin' around."
"165399380-0-29748";"My sword arm's getting stiff with all this waiting. Maybe I'll get some practice in before I leave."
"165399380-0-29769";"The best horses aren't just strong, they're smart. Now I'll be honest—these ladies aren't guild scholars, but they're sharper than most. \n\nSo what do you say? Need a ride?"
"165399380-0-29775";"The last of the Heritance has been driven out. Silsailen is safe once again, thanks to you."
"165399380-0-29781";"I feel … I'll never leave that cavern, no matter how far away I travel."
"165399380-0-29806";"Welcome to my home, friend. Get you some mead?"
"165399380-0-29844";"Hey there, traveler. Come to watch the trials? Or join perhaps?"
"165399380-0-29901";"Yeah?"
"165399380-0-29953";"I can't believe we got this far, only to have this happen."
"165399380-0-29988";"You're adorable."
"165399380-0-29989";"I hear you adventurers go around murdering potential threats. Ever think of reasoning with them?"
"165399380-0-30026";"The giant left us little more than our lives. We have no wares and no coin to rebuild. My mother is too proud to admit it, but this may be the end for us."
"165399380-0-30033";"I don't really stand on ceremony, so out with it. I'm very busy today."
"165399380-0-30034";"Why my father continues to cater to these … foreigners … baffles me."
"165399380-0-30039";"You really shouldn't be in here. The Skald-King is extremely busy right now."
"165399380-0-30040";"Celebration is fine, but we must stay vigilant. Especially with so many visiting dignitaries in the city."
"165399380-0-30041";"What a humble chamber for such an important king. We could all learn a lesson from this impressive dryskin."
"165399380-0-30042";"Ten years and they throw a party. Only the Nords."
"165399380-0-30043";"With all the work the ambassador has given me, I won't get to attend any of the celebration."
"165399380-0-30046";"I remember when we didn't have to put up with all this Pact nonsense. That was when I was young and I ran the forge. Now my daughter's daughter stokes the fires. And I sit in here. Alone."
"165399380-0-30050";"This one is not worthy to talk to such an accomplished traveler.\n\nThis one expresses astonishment and admiration!"
"165399380-0-30068";"Soon as my brother is well, I'm out of here. I'm brokering a deal to buy blades in Mathiisen."
"165399380-0-30088";"Feel free to browse, friend. Best prices in all the Rift."
"165399380-0-30097";"Well done!"
"165399380-0-30103";"And that was the last time Geirmund was ever seen.\n\nOh. Yes?"
"165399380-0-30135";"Riften welcomes those who mind their own business."
"165399380-0-30138";"<This Dark Elf appears to have died beside a nest of kwama eggs.>"
"165399380-0-30155";"The view from up here is amazing."
"165399380-0-30158";"A thousand pardons, but please do not stray too far from the walls while in our village. It is for your own safety, and ours.\n\nOur shops are still open, for your convenience."
"165399380-0-30160";"I'd heard rumors you were here, stirring up trouble. Fortunately, you're easier to find than I expected."
"165399380-0-30163";"You've done it! Now, we name you to the crowd."
"165399380-0-30165";"When you sit, you exercise muscles that can atrophy if you stand or walk around too much."
"165399380-0-30167";"Well done, champion."
"165399380-0-30178";"What were we thinking?"
"165399380-0-30179";"Oh thank Kyne! Can you see to Jakaral? \n\nHe lured the giants away from us so we could escape."
"165399380-0-30195";"I have news from Vernim Wood!"
"165399380-0-30272";"My wife and her cousins run the shops on Merchants Row. Me? I take care of the house. \n\nI assume you don't have a problem with that."
"165399380-0-30276";"Between the fumes and the berserk kwama, I didn't think I'd make it out of there."
"165399380-0-30277";"Please don't make me go back in the mine yet. The kwama went crazy!"
"165399380-0-30282";"I like working as a librarian, but this isn't much of a library."
"165399380-0-30284";"Trade's picking up in the harbor, isn't it?"
"165399380-0-30285";"The Ra Gada won't get their hands on our gold so easily!"
"165399380-0-30286";"I hope things get back to normal soon. My business is suffering!"
"165399380-0-30287";"Not sure what was worse, the smell of the fumes in the cave or the taste of the potion Edrasa just gave me."
"165399380-0-30288";"I sell armor. I don't normally use it myself."
"165399380-0-30301";"I got a whiff of those fumes and my head's still pounding. Small wonder the kwama went crazy."
"165399380-0-30304";"Work piles up faster than dead bodies, doesn't it?"
"165399380-0-30305";"Fighting leaves one with a powerful appetite, no?"
"165399380-0-30306";"Remarkably, we lost very little from the marketplace, but the residential district was nearly burned to the ground."
"165399380-0-30310";"They say there are fumes in the mine, but I don't see how that's possible. We're raising kwama, not digging for minerals."
"165399380-0-30370";"I love listening to the roar of drunken Nords, but it's far too dangerous for me to go inside that drinking hall.\n\nMost Nords don't care much for Altmer."
"165399380-0-30375";"Another round of drinks! Another song! \n\nAha! And I see I have another ardent admirer."
"165399380-0-30379";"Apologies. Betting is closed. Come back later."
"165399380-0-30385";"Get down! Don't let them find me!"
"165399380-0-30386";"I've never seen anything like it. The attackers used Dwarven spheres and spiders!"
"165399380-0-30391";"If you plan to fight in the arena, I suggest you use your own weapon. These tend to snap on impact."
"165399380-0-30397";"Ahh. I saw you around at Geirmund's. Here to save me. How nice! \n\nHow nice."
"165399380-0-30399";"Unless you've got business with me, leave me be.\n\nEven if you do have business with me, I don't give a fig. Piss off."
"165399380-0-30408";"Hmm. You look like you could win a bar fight. But what about a drinking contest? That's a real challenge."
"165399380-0-30411";"What are you looking at?"
"165399380-0-30428";"Why we feed and house that stupid dog, I'll never understand. The damn flea bag bit me again!"
"165399380-0-30440";"Just look at them over there! Win one battle and think they've won the war."
"165399380-0-30441";"The Maulborn know we're here, but they don't care. I guess they're not frightened by a handful of house guards."
"165399380-0-30444";"First Narsis and now here! All we can do is watch. There aren't enough of us to challenge them."
"165399380-0-30457";"I don't feel so good."
"165399380-0-30460";"We're lucky. My wife Taderi and I made it out alive."
"165399380-0-30461";"This poor one didn't make it. What a shame."
"165399380-0-30462";"If not for Viros, I wouldn't have survived."
"165399380-0-30463";"It hurts so much."
"165399380-0-30471";"You nearly scared me to death when you and Elynisi came through that door."
"165399380-0-30472";"There was an explosion … then the wall collapsed on top of me … by the Three, it hurts!"
"165399380-0-30473";"Whenever I get nervous, I pace. Unless something changes, I'm going to wear a hole in this floor."
"165399380-0-30474";"I'm hoping to find something for my nix hound, Anther, to eat."
"165399380-0-30475";"I can hear the ghosts wailing outside. What do they want with us?"
"165399380-0-30476";"That woman came into town. That's when all this terrible trouble started."
"165399380-0-30477";"I hid in the chamber below the temple when the explosion occurred. I'm lucky to be alive."
"165399380-0-30478";"I hope that Aamela can help my brother Nilus."
"165399380-0-30479";"We're lucky the inn had so many books. We've been able to keep the fire going, but we'll run out of books soon. Then we'll have to burn the holy texts."
"165399380-0-30480";"I'm so nervous. I just can't seem to get any sleep."
"165399380-0-30482";"People often say I look just like my sister, but I don't see the resemblance."
"165399380-0-30483";"We were lucky enough to survive the explosion, but now we're surrounded by hostile spirits!"
"165399380-0-30484";"My husband, Dural. We were separated on our way to the inn. He never made it, and they won't even let me go out to look for him."
"165399380-0-30513";"The Maulborn really made a mess of things.\n\nWe've got a lot to clean up before we're ready to open."
"165399380-0-30515";"The Maulborn really care about the little people. We received more help from them than we have from the Houses or the Tribunal."
"165399380-0-30516";"Ani? Is that you? I hope they let me in soon. And I hope it's warm in there. I'm so cold."
"165399380-0-30517";"They call it the Llodos plague, and we're here to get help for my brothers. It's taking so long, though. So many people are sick."
"165399380-0-30518";"Why have the Three abandoned us? A mother shouldn't watch her daughters wither. That's not … not how it's supposed to be."
"165399380-0-30519";"Father thinks we don't see him pray to the Tribunal. I know it's hopeless, but he wants to help."
"165399380-0-30520";"My daughters deserve better than this, but there's nothing more I can do. We must keep up appearances, however. For their sakes."
"165399380-0-30521";"I'm not sure about all this. The Maulborn seem too good to be true, if you ask me."
"165399380-0-30522";"I've been helping my sister, but now I'm starting to get the shivers. I hope I don't have the plague, too."
"165399380-0-30523";"This is unacceptable! People are dying, actually dying! There are dead bodies piled in carts! I won't let them cart off my wife like some … dead peasant!"
"165399380-0-30524";"Please, go away. I don't want to spread the plague."
"165399380-0-30527";"I have a bad feeling about this place. The Maulborn are friendly enough, but something isn't right …."
"165399380-0-30529";"I feel … wrong. Not just sick. Something's very wrong."
"165399380-0-30532";"This damn plague! I need help, but I don't trust these Maulborn cultists. Who are they? Where did they come from? Why haven't we heard about them before?"
"165399380-0-30533";"I'm writing to my cousin to let him know about this plague. I want him to leave Mournhold before the plague spreads there."
"165399380-0-30534";"My brother's a scholar. A master of divination and illusion. It hurts so much to see him like this."
"165399380-0-30535";"I'm sorry, do I know you? Dalyn says I'm hallucinating, but I don't know if he's real."
"165399380-0-30536";"The Maulborn have special healers called nostrums. That's why they were able to develop a cure so quickly.\n\nFeel my head. Do I feel warm to you?"
"165399380-0-30539";"For a group of healers and care-givers, the Maulborn sure carry around a lot of weapons."
"165399380-0-30541";"I was just telling handsome Belos here about a quiet place I know. But my, look at you! I think you might be more fun."
"165399380-0-30542";"Wherever we are, wherever we go, my sister finds someone to flirt with. We came here to help, but she's more interested in aiding the not-quite-sick among the crowd. And those with a bit of muscle tone. Typical."
"165399380-0-30544";"I miss my brother and my father. I even miss my brother's silly little nix-hound. Does that mean I'm dying?"
"165399380-0-30545";"Ginger! No! My poor, poor nixie. My brother and my nix-hound, both victims of this damn plague!"
"165399380-0-30546";"Please go away. It hurts to talk."
"165399380-0-30547";"There's a breeze up here. It's cold, but it keeps the stink of the Serk away."
"165399380-0-30549";"Please, can you spare some gold? I want to hire a cart to bring my sick cousin to the Serk."
"165399380-0-30550";"Who are these Maulborn and where did they get this miraculous cure?"
"165399380-0-30552";"I'm here for the cure, that's all. Please tell this woman that I'm not interested."
"165399380-0-30553";"You know, I never appreciated the hired help before I got sick. When I'm well again, I'm giving gifts to all my servants."
"165399380-0-30554";"I feel terrible, but I'm not worried. Vunden will take care of me."
"165399380-0-30556";"Alaru means everything to me. I'm not leaving her side."
"165399380-0-30557";"I came here so my dear Urynnar could be cured, but I've been inspired. If they'll have me, I'm going to join the Maulborn and make sure others get the help they need."
"165399380-0-30559";"As soon as I get well I'm going to join the Maulborn. I want to help others, just as they helped me."
"165399380-0-30560";"My wife's been helping out since she arrived. She's sick, but she still goes out of her way to lend a hand."
"165399380-0-30563";"Pardon? We're not open for business yet. Be a while."
"165399380-0-30566";"The Hlaalu allowed me to set up shop here in the Gorge if I promised to help clean up."
"165399380-0-30572";"Look at all this trash! It's hard to decide what to keep and what to burn."
"165399380-0-30573";"Velyn Harbor nearly boiled over. Glad you put a lid on it."
"165399380-0-30574";"Wish I'd been here for the excitement. Might've made a profit. Still, plenty of good weapons ready for sale."
"165399380-0-30575";"Mastering a weapon can take a lifetime. Of course, it helps when the weapon's a masterpiece. \n\nLucky for you, that's all I sell."
"165399380-0-30579";"Hurry up. I've got me some hot metal to work."
"165399380-0-30584";"Magic always comes with a price, but my prices are eminently reasonable."
"165399380-0-30585";"A good suit of armor is all that stands between you and your enemy."
"165399380-0-30586";"I don't know about bringing my wares to Velyn Harbor. This place is dangerous."
"165399380-0-30587";"Fermented meat, spoiled milk, and honey! Those make a good Bosmer brew.\n\nIf you want something else, I can help you, too."
"165399380-0-30608";"What can I help you with? Something mystical, I hope."
"165399380-0-30609";"I'm trying to stay on the down-low. Just keep walking."
"165399380-0-30614";"This Vox is evil. Word of her plague has spread to the north. We came from Eastmarch to help our Pact allies."
"165399380-0-30615";"Looking for a little excitement? The Fighters Guild can provide it."
"165399380-0-30616";"Ready to fight for the Dominion? I sure am! Defending Velyn Harbor gave me a taste of battle, and I hunger for more."
"165399380-0-30617";"She scares their gods and the Dark Elves send only a handful of soldiers to confront her?\n\nIf this was Eastmarch, Vox's head would already be on a pike."
"165399380-0-30619";"Hey there, friend! Just looking for an ale? Or a chance at the trials?"
"165399380-0-30621";"Well met. You look a little lost. Are you looking for the kegs? Or the competition?"
"165399380-0-30623";"Velyn Harbor survived, but many of our homes burned."
"165399380-0-30624";"It's amazing the Drublog didn't run off with all this stuff!"
"165399380-0-30625";"Please, don't bother me! I'm trying to write the Ballad of Velyn Harbor! It was much simpler to free the harbor than to sing about it!"
"165399380-0-30626";"I'm here to help with the reconstruction. There's money to be made here!"
"165399380-0-30627";"Relax! We're just cleaning up the beach. Invasions make such a mess."
"165399380-0-30628";"What do you want? We're not doing anything wrong!"
"165399380-0-30629";"All the fighting scared away the fish. The mudcrabs are feasting, though."
"165399380-0-30630";"Have you seen my cat? She's gone. Did one of those Drublog eat her?"
"165399380-0-30631";"You! You're the one that helped the Fists and formed the militia! Wish you'd stick around to help with clean-up."
"165399380-0-30632";"My oxen got loose when the Drublog attacked. I'm lucky they didn't end up roasted or slaughtered, I guess."
"165399380-0-30633";"Damn Drublogs' blood must've poisoned the worms! Fish ain't biting!"
"165399380-0-30634";"I have no idea how we're going to rebuild."
"165399380-0-30635";"I don't know who lived here before, but I don't think they're coming back."
"165399380-0-30636";"We cornered a few of the Ra Gada and their pet Wood Orcs on the ship. They can't leave the harbor, but no one wants to go in and clear them out, yet."
"165399380-0-30637";"The mayor of Velyn Harbor died during the attack. We need to find a new leader."
"165399380-0-30638";"We have a lot of work to do. The Drublog destroyed almost everything."
"165399380-0-30639";"They say our mayor was poisoned. Those Drublog Wood Orcs wouldn't do something like that.\n\nAt least, I don't think so."
"165399380-0-30640";"You look familiar …. Oh! You fought the Drublog!"
"165399380-0-30641";"Velyn Harbor's been exciting lately. I could do with a little less excitement."
"165399380-0-30642";"I'd like to get the worst of this cleared away by nightfall."
"165399380-0-30643";"Looks like someone started a fire in here."
"165399380-0-30644";"Just like always. My partners'll talk while I work."
"165399380-0-30645";"I should be grateful, I know, but rebuilding will be hard work."
"165399380-0-30646";"I appreciate what the Fists of Thalmor and the new militia did, but we need to rebuild! I need to find some help."
"165399380-0-30647";"It's a good thing some of the townsfolk fought back. I would never have had the courage to do that!"
"165399380-0-30648";"The Ra Gada won't mess with us again!"
"165399380-0-30758";"I weep for my gentle guar! I wish we could have saved them all."
"165399380-0-30768";"Don't know you. Don't care to, either.\n\nBack off while your face is still in one piece."
"165399380-0-30769";"Eh, what's that? Barely understand you people from around here. I'm no scholar myself, but at least I know normal speech!"
"165399380-0-30770";"Not bad, not bad. Certainly not my usual tastes, but I won't turn down the local … delicacies.\n\nOh, you're not one of Rejmina's? A thousand pardons."
"165399380-0-30771";"I think they've watered down my drink again! I should kick'n that door and show 'em what we do to drink-robbers 'round here!"
"165399380-0-30772";"I wish the Silvenar would visit here. I hear his beauty brings awe to man and mer alike."
"165399380-0-30773";"You can make so many meals out of meat!\n\nI can't imagine what it might be like to … grow something and eat it. That's against the Green Pact!"
"165399380-0-30775";"I can't sleep at night with all the wolves howling."
"165399380-0-30776";"They say you should wrestle wolves when you're feeling lonely. I tried it once, but it didn't make me feel any better."
"165399380-0-30777";"Why would I ever leave Deepwoods? I mean, aside from the fear of getting eaten by wolves?"
"165399380-0-30779";"These blades aren't bad. Doubt they could hold up to our Colovian armor, but for a backwater hovel like this, it's good quality."
"165399380-0-30780";"What? What?"
"165399380-0-30781";"Found a curious waterlogged book in the river a few days back. It's a fascinating read!"
"165399380-0-30782";"This ale's not bad. Least, they told me it was ale. It's sweet, like Ma used to make."
"165399380-0-30783";"Mmm mmm. I could get used to this view."
"165399380-0-30785";"I've got half a mind to up and leave this swamp-hole. Never seen an insect dwarf a dog! And I certainly don't want to find out if they can bite like one."
"165399380-0-30786";"Grateful just to have a dry place to set my old bones. This'll be my last tour with the captain, methinks."
"165399380-0-30787";"Got no business with you, unless you want to meet one of my arrows close up."
"165399380-0-30788";"Never again. I'm done with games for good. I've got to find a way to get that ring back!"
"165399380-0-30795";"Such terrible things happen here."
"165399380-0-30796";"Those evil cats need to be punished for this."
"165399380-0-30798";"My songs are silent now, for my heart mourns."
"165399380-0-30803";"Be quiet. Those cat bastards didn't see me sneak in here. I'm safe, for now."
"165399380-0-30817";"Welcome to Sanguine's Dem … Deme … Sanguine's … Sanguine's party! \n\nLeave the Divines at the door and come have a good time!"
"165399380-0-30819";"This is ridiculous. I've been waiting in line for … what day is it?"
"165399380-0-30823";"I love this place! We don't have anything like it in Skyrim."
"165399380-0-30834";"This temple has survived three purges, four wars, and an attempted crusade. And you know why? Because it's Sanguine! He's not that evil!"
"165399380-0-30841";"Sanguine was here once. I saw him! He waved at me. Well, he told me to move along. What an honor!"
"165399380-0-30848";"I don't understand why everyone hates Daedra. I mean, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, sure. But Sanguine seems harmless. He's certainly more fun than the Divines."
"165399380-0-30849";"Stay away from those ogrim. Very unfriendly creatures! And they smell bad, too."
"165399380-0-30853";"I left my family for this place. And you know what? I don't miss a single one of them."
"165399380-0-30856";"Those Dremora don't scare me. Give me a sword and I'll take them down a peg or two."
"165399380-0-30858";"Why would anyone ever want to leave this place?"
"165399380-0-30860";"Nice to see you! I just stopped by for one drink, but they taste so good!"
"165399380-0-30861";"I enjoy the arena games. The blood, the stabbing! It's all so exciting!"
"165399380-0-30863";"You missed the best fight last night. I caught an arm!"
"165399380-0-30885";"Welcome to Sanguine's Demesne! Put down your weapons, grab a drink, and join the celebration!\n\nActually, hang on to your weapons. The Daedra can get a little feisty."
"165399380-0-30887";"Let me guess. You're here for the party, right? It's through the door at the end of the tunnel."
"165399380-0-30894";"Seen any Drublog nearby? I'm afraid they're going to come back and finish off what they started."
"165399380-0-30895";"I am very drunk, and standing is surprisingly difficult."
"165399380-0-30896";"We've seen more than our fair share of sorrow. It's my job to comfort everyone who lost sons and daughters to this madness, even when my own daughter is gone as well.\n\nI trust you're not here to add to our troubles?"
"165399380-0-30900";"Praise Sanguine! That temple makes this swamp almost tolerable."
"165399380-0-30902";"Thane Mera isn't home right now. She has so much to do what with the Konunleikar and all the visiting dignitaries."
"165399380-0-30903";"What do you think? I so want a suit of Nord armor, but I'm not sure this works for me. Perhaps I should go for the light armor instead."
"165399380-0-30904";"Lots of people in Windhelm right now. It's rather exciting."
"165399380-0-30907";"Ten cheers for the Skald-King! One for every year of his reign!"
"165399380-0-30908";"Cheer? I say ten drinks for King Jorunn. And then ten more!"
"165399380-0-30909";"Ooh. This Nord beverage makes my head all fuzzy. What was I singing again?"
"165399380-0-30919";"Saint Veloth taught us to respect the Daedra, not fear them."
"165399380-0-30934";"We'll get through this. Vox just caught us off guard."
"165399380-0-30937";"Healer says I'll be fine, but by Veloth, how it hurts. \n\nWatch out for the tails on those clannfear."
"165399380-0-30944";"I'm appealing to the saints to heal my injury. I think it's starting to work."
"165399380-0-30947";"Cursed Daedra smashed the holy reliquary. Will I ever polish it again?"
"165399380-0-30954";"Holy Veloth was a warrior as well as a philosopher. We're not afraid of Daedra."
"165399380-0-30962";"I'm trying not to be angry at Magistrix Vox. She's misguided and lost.\n\nI'll redouble my prayers for her."
"165399380-0-30964";"I heard there was another stranger visiting the Vale. How tedious."
"165399380-0-30966";"This is the Vale of the Ghost Snake, outsider. What do you want here?"
"165399380-0-30967";"Why are you here, outsider?"
"165399380-0-30973";"Treat the snakes with respect, and they will respect you."
"165399380-0-30974";"Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who actually does any work around here."
"165399380-0-30978";"The Coiled Path requires a light tread."
"165399380-0-30982";"What? Never seen a Nord who could use magic?"
"165399380-0-30983";"What? Never seen a Nord use magic before?"
"165399380-0-30984";"May Kyne guide my way and light my path. \n\nAnd may Kyne forgive my parents for raising a daughter cursed with magic."
"165399380-0-30987";"Just wait till the instructors see true Argonian magic in action. I'll be in the advanced class in no time."
"165399380-0-30988";"I can't believe I'm drinking with these Dark Elves. They enslaved my people, and now they're teaching me magic.\n\nThis is going to take some getting used to."
"165399380-0-30989";"I'm one of the first Argonians admitted to the Academy since slavery was outlawed and the institution decided to open its doors to all members of the Pact. \n\nI hope I can handle the pressure."
"165399380-0-30990";"You must be new. Did they tell you how hard this place is?\n\nI'm in my second session and I'm still struggling with illusions, alterations, and military strategy."
"165399380-0-30991";"The Academy better not disappoint me. I waited my whole life for this honor."
"165399380-0-30993";"I think that instructor over there just offered to sell an Academy invitation. For gold!\n\nI must be mistaken. Why would an instructor do such a thing?"
"165399380-0-30994";"No! My report was almost finished when a shadow cluck ate it! I can't believe I have to start over!"
"165399380-0-30995";"My friends and I trained all our lives for this.\n\nA shame I was the only one who got selected. Maybe next season for them."
"165399380-0-30996";"I'm so nervous. I'd kill for some flin right about now."
"165399380-0-30997";"Maybe now that his report's gone, Belvo'll pay some attention to me.\n\nWhat? Belvo just needs some help with his priorities."
"165399380-0-31026";"I was looking for Sergeant Aera, but the Thane tells me she was slain valiantly defending her from the Worm Cult."
"165399380-0-31028";"I wonder if something happened to the water? Too much blood, maybe?"
"165399380-0-31029";"It's great the Redguard Ra Gada are gone, but we need to bring back the fish!"
"165399380-0-31030";"The fish aren't biting. I think all the excitement has them worried. Guess I'll need some new bait …."
"165399380-0-31035";"If you're looking for my sister, get in line. She's out at the stables today.\n\nIf you want something to drink, grab a table and wait your turn."
"165399380-0-31045";"Well met, traveler. Good to have another strong arm in the field."
"165399380-0-31053";"Nothing like a Dark Elf covered in mud to brighten my day."
"165399380-0-31054";"This isn't the most humiliating thing One-Eye's done to a nosy fellow. She's got a leather collar for the ones that really scrape her scales."
"165399380-0-31055";"So much decoration, so little useful coverage. It's a wonder the Pact hasn't fallen to bandits, if this is what they suit their soldiers in."
"165399380-0-31056";"He's a handsome one, Neeta-Li. At least, I think it's a ""he."" \n\nEither way, handsome. I'd take 'em home, no question."
"165399380-0-31057";"This spot has the best rays in the afternoon. If I don't stake my claim, some other mud-scale gets here first."
"165399380-0-31058";"You must got something better to do than bother me, now don'tcha?"
"165399380-0-31059";"Your smell pleases me. Many nights spent in the swamps, I gather?"
"165399380-0-31060";"Can't you see we're having a conversation, here?"
"165399380-0-31061";"Warm welcome, kitten. S'jash sits at the bow, if you wish to speak with him."
"165399380-0-31062";"I've no quarrel with you, stranger. Leave me to my drink. It's the only rest I get all day."
"165399380-0-31063";"My patience for these whining merchants wears thin. Perhaps I should bite one of their noses off to get them back in line."
"165399380-0-31064";"Don't get much shore leave nowadays. Think you could leave a body to enjoy herself, won'tcha?"
"165399380-0-31066";"I'm collecting letters. We give them to the guards, to pass to family in quarantine. Deliver any for you?"
"165399380-0-31067";"I know this scaly rat took my ledger. He thinks he can fool me, but I know!\n\nFilthy beasts, the whole lot of them!"
"165399380-0-31068";"Why isn't High Kinlord Rilis or our new Queen doing anything about this plague? Never would have happened in the old days."
"165399380-0-31069";"I've heard stories of the Maormer sniffing around Auridon lately. \n\nWouldn't be surprised if those Sea Elves started this plague business. Their ships are full of sea rats!"
"165399380-0-31070";"I've got my eye on you, stranger."
"165399380-0-31071";"Soon as this is all sorted, I'm going to Shattered Grove. Friend told me the critters there are so friendly, they come right up and let you pet them.\n\nIn the meantime, got work to do."
"165399380-0-31072";"I am so glad my daughter Elenya went off with that Telenger fellow. She's part of an important Mage Guild project now!\n\nDon't know what I'd do if she got this nasty plague."
"165399380-0-31074";"Shh. Quiet. I'm just pretending to be sick so I can be with my husband. They put him in quarantine last week, I'm so worried about him.\n\nDon't tell anyone."
"165399380-0-31076";"Someone has to keep an eye on goings-on. That someone is me."
"165399380-0-31077";"Dimarra hopes the Dominion goes home soon. Too many eyes have seen this one.\n\nSomeone from Tenmar will find this one. No, let it not be so!"
"165399380-0-31082";"Monkeys. The worst thing those Khajiit brought with them. That and the fleas, but at least those don't screech when you take their bananas.\n\nGreedy monkeys."
"165399380-0-31083";"Mmm, what have we here? What a fragrant vision of beauty!\n\nCome a little closer. Feel that rumbling, kitten? You would like to … have more of a taste. Is that not so?"
"165399380-0-31085";"I seem to inspire nothing but snickers from the others on the decks.\n\nI don't mind. I prefer to stay down here."
"165399380-0-31086";"There's no use worrying so. Turan will make himself sick. Nothing to do about it, it is.\n\nAs soon as I'm well again, I'll show him there's no reason to worry."
"165399380-0-31087";"My egg-brother was once in the Shadowscales. A few hours earlier, and it would have been me.\n\nCertainly would have been a better fit. He got himself killed on his first contract. 'Course, didn't help that his first contract was me."
"165399380-0-31088";"The jungle rat Bosmer think they can keep our docks from us. I saw 'em laughing.\n\nWell, I'll spit and roast the next one I get my hands on. We'll see how much they laugh then."
"165399380-0-31091";"What? You need directions or somethin'? There's the door."
"165399380-0-31092";"Nothing like the smell of fresh fish at sunrise! Well, except old fish at sundown. That's a smell to remember, I tell you."
"165399380-0-31093";"All this shore leave's making me crazy in the head. If the captain doesn't get back soon, I … I don't know what I'll do."
"165399380-0-31094";"This ship's not free, friend. You buy your way, or you work your way. Or you swim. Ha!"
"165399380-0-31096";"Nope, not on my list. Can't take any shipments unless you're on my list. No exceptions."
"165399380-0-31104";"We ain't got room for wanderers. All bunks're taken.\n\nYou're welcome to sleep in the barn, if you don't mind the rat droppings."
"165399380-0-31108";"I don't know what's turned my stomach so horribly. True, this place is less than gourmet, but I thought a mug of mead would be safe!"
"165399380-0-31112";"Hrr, stop that infernal drum-beating! You shake the ground with that noise!"
"165399380-0-31113";"Are you from the swamps, traveler? Seem comfortable enough in the muck, from the looks of it."
"165399380-0-31115";"Aye, and who might you be? Don't look like you're from this stinkmire.\n\nTake my advice—you don't want to die in a place like this. So keep your nose clean."
"165399380-0-31116";"You don't find a lot of moments for peace and quiet in a place like this. Got to carve them out for yourself, or you'll go mad like the rest of 'em."
"165399380-0-31118";"I have One-Eye's trust to keep her accounts. And that trust is not for sale."
"165399380-0-31121";"You want better stock? Come back in, oh, let's say a month. If I'm still here, I may have something worth your time."
"165399380-0-31123";"We're missing a few barrels, but that's understandable. This must be the seediest place I've ever brought trade to, but I keep coming back.\n\nWhen the coin's this good, it's hard to turn down."
"165399380-0-31124";"By the looks of things, I should start importing weapons and armors. Conflict is always good for business."
"165399380-0-31127";"Rotmeth's not for the faint of heart. Or of stomach!\n\nAslohild knows how to brew it, though. Just like home."
"165399380-0-31128";"See them in the cages there? Yeah. You don't want to be them."
"165399380-0-31129";"Watch out! Some invaders made it inside!"
"165399380-0-31130";"We've cornered some of the invaders inside. But there are too many for us to handle alone."
"165399380-0-31131";"There aren't enough of us to rush inside. We'd just get killed."
"165399380-0-31132";"I'm not going in there without back-up! Where's the Captain?"
"165399380-0-31133";"If the Lieutenant wants us to go in there, he's going to have to tell me himself. There's at least a half-dozen invaders inside!"
"165399380-0-31134";"If you want to go in there, that's your problem. We're just here to keep anyone from getting out."
"165399380-0-31135";"We can't go in there! We're the last line of defense Velyn Harbor has! It's a fool's errand!"
"165399380-0-31137";"If they come out, we'll try to hold them off. But we can't just go inside and die."
"165399380-0-31140";"The bugs never stop, you know! Blasted creatures must be a curse sent down by Shor himself!"
"165399380-0-31141";"Four hundred seventeen thousand, six hundred and … thrice curse you! Now I've lost count!\n\nUgh. I'll be here until the next moon at this rate."
"165399380-0-31142";"Do you see them? The eyes in the leaves? They are always watching, you know. Their lids fell off, long ago.\n\nThey think I don't hear them. Know they follow me. But I do. And I'll catch one, soon enough!"
"165399380-0-31147";"We need more actors in Skyrim. We have an annoying bard or two in every inn, but no real actors."
"165399380-0-31148";"Theater makes me feel so cultured. I usually don't understand what's going on, but that's hardly the point."
"165399380-0-31149";"I hear there's a war going on out there. If it's all the same to you, I think I'll stay in here."
"165399380-0-31150";"The architecture reminds me of my summers in Vvardenfell. I find it to be very peaceful."
"165399380-0-31154";"Something you need? Anything for a discreet friend."
"165399380-0-31171";"A place in the center market. What a stroke of luck for us!"
"165399380-0-31172";"We have been lucky, some might say. I say that willpower overrides luck."
"165399380-0-31173";"The Rothalen family has overcome many hardships. We are Dunmer—we will rise from the ashes once again!"
"165399380-0-31174";"Unless you have food and drink, get out."
"165399380-0-31181";"I found my husband Dural! He was hiding in the temple."
"165399380-0-31187";"Thank you so much for your help."
"165399380-0-31188";"Anther and I wanted to say thanks!"
"165399380-0-31195";"My sister and I can't bear to be separated. Thank you for saving us."
"165399380-0-31197";"Selfora will recover and prosper. Salima and I will see to it."
"165399380-0-31204";"Please respect the peaceful nature of the Tribunal Temple."
"165399380-0-31205";"Welcome to the Tribunal Temple. May your worship bring you solace."
"165399380-0-31206";"Things are stressful with only one of the Three in residence. Even Almalexia can't be in multiple places at the same time."
"165399380-0-31207";"Please keep your voice down. We whisper to maintain the serenity of this holy place."
"165399380-0-31208";"We help those who come to the Temple seeking aid. Often, we can deal with problems before they ever reach the Tribunal."
"165399380-0-31209";"I'm training to become a priest. Today I'm practicing my Temple voice."
"165399380-0-31210";"My wife has been studying to become a Tribunal Priest. I'm very proud of her."
"165399380-0-31211";"My sister came to ask the Tribunal to reprimand Shad Astula's irresponsible mages. She's seeking a compromise when she should be demanding recompense!"
"165399380-0-31212";"The Academy continues to use my farm for their training exercises, and it's starting to interfere with my ability to make a living. I don't want to complain, but the Tribunal has to do something!"
"165399380-0-31213";"I represent my people to the Dunmer in an effort to maintain good relations. Things are going well. Only a few Dark Elves have mistaken me for a servant."
"165399380-0-31215";"I come from a long line of diplomats. The Dark Elves have often spoken with us Nords, in peacetime and in war. They are not fools and do not shy away from dealing with people bigger than they are. I can respect that."
"165399380-0-31216";"My husband and I visit Mournhold often, but lately many more diplomats from Skyrim make the journey. Have you met Rigurt? He's one of our newest envoys."
"165399380-0-31221";"The Treethane says we just have to set our roots and recover. Easy thing to say when you haven't lost everything.\n\nWhat am I saying? We've all lost something here. There's just too much to take in."
"165399380-0-31222";"I'm the apothecary of the village. Or at least I was until those brutes came in and ransacked my supplies.\n\nAh, there's nothing for it but to salvage and move on. We've got our lives, at least."
"165399380-0-31223";"Come to try your hand against old <<1>>? I may be blind, but I can smell you from here, Goblin-spawn."
"165399380-0-31237";"We're all trying to do our best to help each other. I hesitate to call this tragedy a good thing, but … it has brought us together.\n\nI just wish it didn't come at such a cost."
"165399380-0-31239";"I don't care what the others say. The Drublog aren't going to stop with one raid, and we need to be ready.\n\nI may just be one Bosmer, but any Drublog shows its face, I'll show it the business side of my blade."
"165399380-0-31240";"I'm luckier than some. I got out of the way just in time.\n\nNever thought I'd find myself hiding in a stew pot, but whatever works, right?"
"165399380-0-31241";"Sorry, I'm a bit busy looking for reagents. Old remedies for wounds and such.\n\nThe beetles I need are getting harder and harder to find."
"165399380-0-31242";"My boy took the fight to those Drublog. He said, ""Mamma, we've got to chase them as far away as possible.""\n\nI wish I'd stopped him. I wish I could have."
"165399380-0-31247";"Students concentrate best on a full stomach. If you're hungry when you cast a spell, you might turn someone into a tasty pie by accident. And we wouldn't want that to happen, would we?"
"165399380-0-31256";"The start of the season is always exciting. New faces at the Academy mean new customers. And new customers mean more sales. \n\nAnd that means more gold in my coffers. Life is good."
"165399380-0-31257";"When the Drublog burned the town, so many people lost everything."
"165399380-0-31264";"This used to be my home. I never thought I'd outlive it."
"165399380-0-31303";"An unprecendented opportunity for research! And perhaps a way to stop this from happening again.\n\nAuri-El protect those that gave their lives here today."
"165399380-0-31308";"Stars. Almost too tired to stand. But we need to examine these pylons before they cool. They could help us prevent this kind of assault on Firsthold in days to come."
"165399380-0-31335";"Velyn Harbor's under attack, and the townsfolk are fleeing to Greenshade! I don't know what the lieutenant's thinking, but we've got to get everyone out of here!"
"165399380-0-31342";"The lieutenant's trying to rally the civilians, but I just want them to get to safety!"
"165399380-0-31343";"Oh … who would do this, and why? Am I being punished? Why take my family and leave me to suffer?"
"165399380-0-31344";"Stop right there. I've got three murders and a heartbroken girl to deal with here. I don't need any more complications."
"165399380-0-31346";"<This woman's throat was slashed and the skin of her ring finger appears torn.>"
"165399380-0-31363";"Er, hello. I thought you were someone else. Share my fire if you must, but don't stay long. I'm expecting someone, any minute now."
"165399380-0-31388";"We've waited for Falinesti's return for so long."
"165399380-0-31389";"The chill at nightfall can catch one unawares. I like to stay close to a warm fire."
"165399380-0-31399";"""A blade is only as good as its bearer."" Pah! Let the expert come at me with a dull blade, and I will prove him wrong."
"165399380-0-31401";"I don't know what's in this, but it tastes divine."
"165399380-0-31403";"Adzi is still sore about that one time. She should know better than to make me angry."
"165399380-0-31404";"I once split an arrow in half with a following shot. My training partner broke my hand for that."
"165399380-0-31405";"Ooh, it hurts …."
"165399380-0-31406";"Jarakh came to find new trading opportunities, but all he found was danger."
"165399380-0-31424";"I was hoping you'd come back. Thank you again for all you've done.\n\nJorald will stay with me as long as I need. He's so very kind. Don't worry for me."
"165399380-0-31425";"Good to see you again. Raerana is resting inside. Go ahead and talk to her, if you want. Just don't get her upset.\n\nShe said it would help her sleep if I watched over her. So here I am."
"165399380-0-31426";"Well met. If hunger afflicts you, I've got the cure! What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-31431";"Honor and blood. May His hand guide your blade."
"165399380-0-31432";"They broke my husband's arm and tied him up! Lady Noellaume even lost her family heirloom! This is awful."
"165399380-0-31590";"You must be here for the secret meeting. Sign in and head downstairs. Madras has already started."
"165399380-0-31592";"In the name of the Aldmeri Dominion, I bid you welcome!\n\nHmm, was that formal enough? I'm still working on my royal-ese."
"165399380-0-31617";"Everyone just has to wait. I'm cooking as fast as I can."
"165399380-0-31663";"Hmm … what? Go away … I'm trying to sleep."
"165399380-0-31664";"Goblin troubles? Rabble-rousing Argonians? What do I care? It isn't like I'm getting paid much anyway."
"165399380-0-31665";"If I can't work, I might as well rest."
"165399380-0-31666";"This trouble will be resolved soon enough. We have to make sure the gear's ready when the mine is!"
"165399380-0-31667";"Damn Goblins! They take our jobs and now they've taken the mine!"
"165399380-0-31668";"Stay down! They're shooting arrows!\n\nI hope the Guard does something about them soon."
"165399380-0-31675";"That was so exciting! A real rescue, with adventure and disguises and everything! You're my hero!"
"165399380-0-31676";"Narsis has been cursed. Plague take us all!"
"165399380-0-31677";"Do what you can to assist our comrades. The skin-stealers are ruthless combatants."
"165399380-0-31681";"The Dominion will pay for this treachery."
"165399380-0-31682";"Strangers seldom find peace in Stillrise. I suggest you leave while you can."
"165399380-0-31683";"Why don't you leave me alone?"
"165399380-0-31684";"Please … there must be some way to end this."
"165399380-0-31685";"We have it better here in Stillrise than most. If it weren't for the necromancers and the whiny villagers, this village would be a paradise."
"165399380-0-31686";"Stillrise is cursed, and now we've got outsiders making trouble. I hope you aren't going to add to our sorrows."
"165399380-0-31687";"I am just so tired."
"165399380-0-31697";"Your presence merely reminds me of what I cannot have. Begone!"
"165399380-0-31698";"Those fools playing soldier … can't they just let it all end?"
"165399380-0-31700";"Some people don't know a blessing when they see one."
"165399380-0-31704";"Go away! If they spot me, there's no telling what they'll do!"
"165399380-0-31705";"Don't bother us! We're training!"
"165399380-0-31708";"Now that you see our true shape, are you horrified?"
"165399380-0-31709";"Don't look at me, damn you!"
"165399380-0-31710";"Now you see our horror, firsthand. You must end this torment! I don't care what happens to us, just so long as this curse ends!\n\nPlease, when the time comes, make the right choice!"
"165399380-0-31711";"You want to die? Of course not. But if you did, would you want to take everyone else with you?"
"165399380-0-31712";"I'm sorry for the soldiers, but the rest of us have endured too much. It's time for this to end!"
"165399380-0-31713";"This isn't what I agreed to. It needs to end."
"165399380-0-31723";"Your time will come, too, stranger, if you stay in Stillrise much longer."
"165399380-0-31724";"The Shaman did his best, but we need this to end, now!"
"165399380-0-31726";"Bet you didn't expect this! Welcome to Stillrise!"
"165399380-0-31730";"What are you trying to do? Get me caught?"
"165399380-0-31731";"Watch it. You're likely to get hit standing there."
"165399380-0-31745";"The ruins crawl with Dominion. Watch yourself out there."
"165399380-0-31748";"Go on and sit down. Enjoy a meal. At least the food is still good in Riften."
"165399380-0-31755";"Are you enjoying yourself at this fine celebration?"
"165399380-0-31756";"I can't thank you enough for freeing me and the others. \n\nI shudder to think what might have happened to us if not for your timely intervention."
"165399380-0-31757";"Without your help, who knows what would have happened to us.\n\nBut what about next time? You can't just follow us around and keep us safe, you know."
"165399380-0-31758";"I feel like I'll never be safe again. \n\nFleeing the horrors of Camlorn, then taken in the night by cultist thugs. When will it all end?"
"165399380-0-31759";"What I wouldn't give to be in a nice warm inn, drinking a pint of ale. Or three."
"165399380-0-31760";"I just need to rest for a bit. I'm sure I'll be all right soon."
"165399380-0-31761";"I'm sure we'll find someplace safe in a few days."
"165399380-0-31763";"To know your weakness is to know your enemy's strength."
"165399380-0-31764";"I'm not arrogant, just better than you."
"165399380-0-31765";"I know, I know. I'm amazing."
"165399380-0-31768";"<This bandit was executed with a single slash to the neck.>"
"165399380-0-31771";"I'm doing what I can, but my family's falling apart."
"165399380-0-31798";"You're the first interesting thing to walk into Narsis in a long time."
"165399380-0-31808";"Unless I killed a friend of yours and yer here to get even, back off. \n\nI'm lookin' for someone and it's not you. It's yer lucky day."
"165399380-0-31810";"The Cultists came out of nowhere. It was chaos. Netapatuu fought back. We all would have died if not for him."
"165399380-0-31812";"We're just researchers. We don't stand a chance. The others are dead, or worse."
"165399380-0-31825";"Not much to do in Ivarstead except drink, fish, hunt, and, well, drink. \n\nI like it here."
"165399380-0-31826";"Welcome to the Horker's Tusk Tavern. Fancy a drink?"
"165399380-0-31931";"Step right up, they have pretty good drink here. You won't find much rat hair in it at least."
"165399380-0-31932";"Haven't seen you here before. Or I don't remember it at least. But welcome to our little tavern. Well, it's not mine, but I kinda feel I belong here, you know what I mean? Well, anyway, hello!"
"165399380-0-31950";"This one will be staying down."
"165399380-0-31952";"Maybe I should go talk to her instead of sending illusions.\n\nNah, that's a horrible idea. I'd probably throw up or something."
"165399380-0-31953";"Isn't this conjuration simply adorable? But when is Drifts going to come over and talk to me?"
"165399380-0-31955";"He insists on sending her small illusions. What a coward.\n\nHe should just go and talk to her!"
"165399380-0-31956";"I'm glad he's going to hurt."
"165399380-0-31958";"I think she's badly hurt."
"165399380-0-31963";"What is it?"
"165399380-0-31968";"I hope our soldiers take the fight all the way to Auridon. I want blood for blood."
"165399380-0-31969";"Look at these magnificent projections. I wonder what they do?\n\nAre they wards? A test of some sort? Maybe mood lighting? I just don't know."
"165399380-0-31970";"I'll never forget him."
"165399380-0-31971";"It's so hard to say goodbye to a friend."
"165399380-0-31972";"I can't believe I lost that fight! I was cheated out of my invitation!\n\nAh, it doesn't matter. My family's gold secured me a new one, and here I am."
"165399380-0-31973";"I need to cast a spell. Conjure a familiar, levitate a groundskeeper, blow something up.\n\nIf instruction doesn't start soon, there's no telling what I might do."
"165399380-0-31974";"I just arrived and I'm already overloaded with work.\n\nConjurations, illusions, healing salves, Pact diplomacy, leadership training. What's next?"
"165399380-0-31975";"My first assignment. Study the flame. Determine what fuels it.\n\nI'm pretty sure the wax and wick fuel it. But it can't be that simple, can it?"
"165399380-0-31976";"My invitation? I don't have it with me. Someone took it, all right?\n\nMy family is dealing with it. Now go bother a Nord, why don't you."
"165399380-0-31978";"What did I drink?"
"165399380-0-31980";"House Hlaalu. That's where I'm going after the Academy certifies me. Merchants need magic, and they pay well.\n\nHey, got any flin?"
"165399380-0-31981";"By Kyne, don't these chattering Dark Elves ever shut up? They're driving me crazy."
"165399380-0-32009";"The Mages Guild will never give up. No werewolf, undead or not, will harm the people of Glenumbra.\n\nWe'll find out how Faolchu fell and we'll put him right back in the grave."
"165399380-0-32010";"We've been at this for weeks.\n\nThe Mages Guild is comprised of the wisest scholars, but even I'm starting to doubt if we can really learn anything here."
"165399380-0-32013";"Is he a friend of yours? This one is doing what she can for him but it is difficult.\n\nAt least he's alive. That makes him lucky compared to the other pilgrims we found in the storm."
"165399380-0-32016";"Never would have thought that I, a mere farmer's son, would one day explore the ruins of the Glenumbra Moors. \n\nI'll never forget this experience."
"165399380-0-32021";"The Mages Guild has never been known as a militaristic force. You tend to find us in ruins, searching for lost knowledge.\n\nBut sometimes even scholars need to take up arms."
"165399380-0-32028";"These lost spirits refuse to rest. They just wander about, lost in the dream of battle.\n\nThe Alessian Order had the wrong intentions, but I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy."
"165399380-0-32033";"The Alessian army was driven by faith to put a quick end to anyone who didn't share their beliefs.\n\nIf only we'd learn these lessons from the past."
"165399380-0-32034";"The remnants of the last battle of Glenumbra Moors still linger.\n\nThat means there's a connection, something that holds them here. But what?"
"165399380-0-32035";"My brother was almost killed by one of Faolchu's werewolves.\n\nI couldn't bear losing him, and I don't want anyone else to suffer such pain. That's why I'm here. We'll find a way to stop Faolchu."
"165399380-0-32037";"We've been out here digging around for hours, and we haven't found one clue. It's hopeless!"
"165399380-0-32041";"This site was the breaking point of the Battle of Glenumbra Moors.\n\nThe Alessian army made one of their last stands here. The Direnni army was able to defeat Faolchu and prevail. We need to figure out how."
"165399380-0-32059";"Burns. My chest is like fire.\n\nSovngarde take me."
"165399380-0-32060";"I begged him not to go on this pilgrimage, but he wouldn't listen. \n\nIf I lose him, my heart will break."
"165399380-0-32067";"I can't stand to watch him suffer any more. I know he'll soon be lost to me."
"165399380-0-32071";"Y'ffre's bones! A brave adventurer! Please, won't you help me?"
"165399380-0-32075";"Welcome to Ivarstead. Stay out of trouble and we'll both be happier."
"165399380-0-32079";"<This body has been stripped of all possessions.>"
"165399380-0-32080";"Just get me some food in my belly and I'll be back at those stairs.\n\nDamned avalanche didn't kill me. I'm not going to give up now."
"165399380-0-32081";"To save a life is the greatest of pleasures. It is why I choose to heal. \n\nThis one would not have lived without your help. Take pride in that. May you always help the innocent in times of need."
"165399380-0-32082";"If you hadn't shown up, I would have been burying my husband now instead of watching him stuff his face. Thank you!"
"165399380-0-32098";"<This corpse is badly burned. His death was recent, no more than a day ago. A note on the body may explain what happened.>"
"165399380-0-32099";"I've been by the Prince's side since he could hold a sword. And I'll be with him until he puts it down again."
"165399380-0-32114";"You need somethin', friend? Got more than enough to do for two of me, so let me be unless you're looking for work."
"165399380-0-32115";"Somethin' you need, stranger? Go talk to Pa."
"165399380-0-32116";"I don't know you. State your business and don't make me angry."
"165399380-0-32121";"<Malsia holds a broken soul gem in her hand.>"
"165399380-0-32123";"Haven't caught much today."
"165399380-0-32159";"<<<1>> lies dead near the shrine to Mauloch. Blood still oozes from a stab wound in his chest.>"
"165399380-0-32169";"I almost had the bugger, but that right tusk came from nowhere! I'm going to have bruises in the morning, I tell you!"
"165399380-0-32170";"I don't know how the mammoths got out, but they certainly aren't coming back in on their own!"
"165399380-0-32171";"Ugh, my head … it's the only thing that doesn't hurt."
"165399380-0-32172";"I saw what you did up there! You took on the Green Hunters! Are you crazy?"
"165399380-0-32181";"<This man was killed by a massive club. He was stripped of all valuables, including his shirt.>"
"165399380-0-32182";"<This woman was stomped by a massive boot. All valuables have already been looted.>"
"165399380-0-32209";"J'Eeja's wares are yours, friend, for a mere pittance."
"165399380-0-32235";"I think that so-called Witch of the Moors puts on airs."
"165399380-0-32238";"My little Firwin … is that you? I can't see you clearly.\n\nI'm so tired, dear."
"165399380-0-32348";"Arfanel must have sent you. The Queen's Eyes see all, eh?"
"165399380-0-32355";"Oh … another guest. Splendid. Vesta will be so pleased. Have you told her you're here? If not, just run into the house and let her know."
"165399380-0-32356";"Welcome to Narsis, where people vanish in the night and a flesh-rotting plague ravages those unfortunate enough to still be here.\n\nThis must be your lucky day."
"165399380-0-32368";"We can rebuild, with time. I don't think many others share that feeling."
"165399380-0-32369";"If we were better stewards of the forest, the forest would have protected us. Don't you see?"
"165399380-0-32370";"I knew this day would come. We should have taken the fight to the Drublog when we were strong. When we were ready."
"165399380-0-32371";"Things are much more peaceful up here. Simpler.\n\nIf I could, I'd live in the treetops. Think of how wonderful that would be!"
"165399380-0-32372";"Me? I'm not hiding. What makes you think that?"
"165399380-0-32384";"Even in this place of war, knowledge can still be found … by those interested in such things."
"165399380-0-32419";"Divines bless you, friend! I am a good man who's fallen on hard times. I have eleven starving children that will surely die without a morsel to eat today. Won't you spare a silver for an honest man and his adoring children?"
"165399380-0-32438";"Greetings, traveler! Welcome to the Pilgrim's Rest, the best inn in Ivarstead."
"165399380-0-32442";"I often wonder if you could get a rock to grow if you cared for it enough."
"165399380-0-32443";"Though it is rare, there are members of the wyrd that are not Bretons."
"165399380-0-32450";"I never thought much of the wyrd, but the way they've taken us in shows they have good hearts."
"165399380-0-32451";"I never thought of living in a tree, but I could get used to this."
"165399380-0-32452";"Thank you for your help, stranger."
"165399380-0-32453";"When can we get back to our lives?"
"165399380-0-32462";"Where I am from, the trees are not so green."
"165399380-0-32464";"Simple toil is good for the heart, or so the wyresses say."
"165399380-0-32465";"I'm glad to be back at camp rather than at that mill."
"165399380-0-32466";"This camp may not be what the survivors from the mill are used to, but it will have to do."
"165399380-0-32468";"What are we to do when the earth itself rises to harm us?"
"165399380-0-32469";"Apples, apples, where are those apples?"
"165399380-0-32470";"Many of the Wyrd dislike fire, but I find I have an affinity for it."
"165399380-0-32495";"Be careful if you're going to Crosswych. Red Rooks have taken over the town. \n\nWe're getting ready to fight back though. If you want to lend a hand, you can join the resistance."
"165399380-0-32496";"You want to watch your step in Crosswych. The place is crawling with Red Rook thugs.\n\nOf course, we'll take any help we can get. If you feel like getting involved, talk to Tamien at the inn."
"165399380-0-32501";"A pact was forged here many years ago. No Baelborne may walk this land. Any of that bloodline who ignore this decree shall be dealt with.\n\nHarshly."
"165399380-0-32503";"Every Baelborne who dares to return to this land shall fall."
"165399380-0-32508";"I have more important things to do than give you directions to the inn."
"165399380-0-32509";"Excuse me, I am much too busy to deal with you right now."
"165399380-0-32526";"You did a great thing this day. If you need anything, you can always find me here."
"165399380-0-32527";"You saved my life. You're a hero."
"165399380-0-32532";"No refunds, no returns. No exceptions."
"165399380-0-32534";"Belarata is closed. All you'll find is a shady Khajiit selling rubble and old spoons."
"165399380-0-32582";"Always happy to serve. Get you something?"
"165399380-0-32583";"Running orders to Mathiisen, but I can stop for a moment. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-32604";"You'd be surprised what bounties the sea provides. Share in the bounty?"
"165399380-0-32605";"From the Skywatch docks to your pack. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-32606";"Weary steps? I have something for that."
"165399380-0-32607";"My deals are the best deals! Taste the value!"
"165399380-0-32608";"Why wait for the high prices in Firsthold? Enjoy bargains for a weary traveler."
"165399380-0-32609";"Great prices for a weary traveler, here. Test my claim?"
"165399380-0-32631";"How did you manage to get here? You must have had quite a swim.\n\nSadly, that skill doesn't qualify you to attend the Academy."
"165399380-0-32632";"Serving the needs of a fort isn't the same as setting up a shop in a city."
"165399380-0-32633";"I've got a quest for you."
"165399380-0-32662";"I'm a duel monster!"
"165399380-0-32664";"I saw a big light over the tree and came this way. Do you need anything?"
"165399380-0-32665";"Before you have any of my brother's drinks, I'd recommend getting some solid food in your stomach."
"165399380-0-32678";"I'll never understand why we didn't build one large stable instead of these two smaller ones. It makes no sense!"
"165399380-0-32686";"Don't tell the stablemaster, but I can't stand the smell of guar."
"165399380-0-32699";"Move aside. I have house business to attend to."
"165399380-0-32747";"I've never seen Mournhold this crowded before."
"165399380-0-32763";"I'm waiting for word from Narsis. I hope things have returned to normal."
"165399380-0-32764";"Thanks to your efforts, order and peace are restored. Crosswych will be back to normal in no time."
"165399380-0-32779";"I'm rather busy right now. Come back later."
"165399380-0-32780";"Do not interrupt me!"
"165399380-0-32781";"<Raynor Vanos doesn't say a word.>"
"165399380-0-32830";"Shoveling guar droppings has one thing going for it. Job security."
"165399380-0-32831";"The Academy turns out the best leaders and mages in the world. And now I'll be a part of it all."
"165399380-0-32836";"You really ought to visit Crosswych when we're not quite so overrun with … pests."
"165399380-0-32843";"This would never happen in Summerset! Where is a justiciar when you need one?"
"165399380-0-32844";"He sold me a welkynd stone! Do welkynd stones dissolve in the rain? I think not!"
"165399380-0-32845";"Don't believe anything that swindler says. Look what his garbage did to my brother. It's not safe!"
"165399380-0-32846";"Ugh … feels like I've been trampled by a mammoth."
"165399380-0-32852";"Another fine night. Or is it day? Doesn't matter. The drinks are still coming."
"165399380-0-32864";"Between the armies tearing up the countryside and the demons terrorizing the island, the dust never stops flying. And it all seems to settle on my doorstep."
"165399380-0-32866";"I have to speak to the King, but they won't let me into the castle."
"165399380-0-32873";"Here to taunt the blind man too? The captain doesn't deserve this mockery!"
"165399380-0-32874";"Will that woman ever stop sweeping? It makes me exhausted just watching her. Not that I mind watching her, you understand…."
"165399380-0-32879";"I'm on a business visit from Vvardenfell. With the Argonians emancipated and Shadowfen open to the free market, there's plenty of money to be made."
"165399380-0-32882";"Much hotter and more humid down here than in Solstheim. Have to say that I like it."
"165399380-0-32890";"Monsters, soldiers, and demons. As long as they leave me to my work, I don't care what they do to each other."
"165399380-0-32893";"I have a great many staves to choose from. Summon powerful magicks with a flick of the wrist!"
"165399380-0-32895";"You will always be welcome in Crosswych."
"165399380-0-32897";"Well done. Well done indeed. \n\nWe'll make sure that something like this does not happen again."
"165399380-0-32901";"I've paid my debt to society. Unfortunately, I haven't paid my tab to Six-Coins."
"165399380-0-32904";"Shh! They'll hear you!"
"165399380-0-32909";"Ever been to the ruins at Bogmother? That's where we returned my mentor, Bran-Na, to the swamp."
"165399380-0-32912";"The Dunmer no longer take us as slaves. But that doesn't mean they take us seriously.\n\nI'm fine with that. The less they know about us, the better."
"165399380-0-32914";"Stormhold's a great city. You give us ten years and it'll be the crown jewel of the Pact."
"165399380-0-32915";"I understand why we need Argonian and Dunmer vicecanons. But what do we need a Nord for? Drunken tie-breaker?"
"165399380-0-32920";"I've got a lot on my mind, and all this noise isn't helping me think. Do I need to get lost in the swamp to get a moment of peace?"
"165399380-0-32923";"If you see that bastard Five-Coins, tell him … don't tell him anything. He doesn't deserve it."
"165399380-0-32927";"They say you can actually go talk to the Dunmer gods. Given the way the Dunmer treated us … do you think that also means you could punch them?"
"165399380-0-32933";"Something has occurred within the Mages Guild, and now I'm being terribly inconvenienced."
"165399380-0-32934";"Wagers only interest me if the stakes are high."
"165399380-0-32936";"I tried to find one of the magisters to assist my lady, but no one's available."
"165399380-0-32938";"My miners will take care of any Red Rooks hiding out in dark corners of the mine. It'll restore their confidence, to send these shiftless rogues running. \n\nMuch obliged to you, for all your help here in Crosswych."
"165399380-0-32939";"A banekin delivered my invitation! Walked right into the house and dropped it in my porridge.\n\nNow I want to see who else got one!"
"165399380-0-32940";"I've been studying at Shad Astula for two seasons now. I can't wait until I get my certificate and take my place as a Pact officer."
"165399380-0-32943";"Thanks for your help on the trail. I might've not made it home without your help."
"165399380-0-32949";"Fishing's pretty good here. The screams and flashes from the Imperial City don't seem to bother the fish any."
"165399380-0-32950";"Hello! Welcome to Admand Brothers Lumber Works. Please don't bother my workers, we have orders to fill."
"165399380-0-32951";"There's plenty of good fishing on Lake Rumare. This is our spot; go find your own."
"165399380-0-32952";"I rue the day I agreed to work here. We have been paid in thin stew for a week. I shall not work without pay."
"165399380-0-32954";"You don't want to talk to me. Yves is the smart one, apparently. I do the work, he drinks the ale. Yes, don't waste your time talking to the dumb Admand brother."
"165399380-0-32955";"Who?\n\nYou about scared me out of my pelt. At least there's flesh on your face. Where did you come from?"
"165399380-0-32959";"I can't believe what I just heard. Magistrix Vox was a paragon of virtue!"
"165399380-0-32968";"I thought they were all dead. Glad to find it isn't so."
"165399380-0-32969";"Never got to repay those Sea Drakes. I'll kill them some other time."
"165399380-0-32970";"I may have only five working fingers, but that's enough to hold a mug."
"165399380-0-32971";"I told you to get out. Glad you ignored me."
"165399380-0-32978";"Nightcaller Molacar inspires me. His interpretation of Vaermina's sendings in our dreams has shown us our true path!"
"165399380-0-32979";"I hope there's a sacrifice this time. It's been too long since we made an offering to Vaermina."
"165399380-0-32980";"I worry that we misread Vaermina's intent. A nightmare may be inspired by a spoiled serving of swamp eel pie. Then would it be Vaermina's will we follow, or the swamp eel's?"
"165399380-0-32981";"Nords boast that they can hold their liquor. What they mean is that they don't care what they do when they're drunk."
"165399380-0-32985";"I don't want your help or your pity. I have willingly offered myself to Vaermina. Only she can save Cyrodiil. If my sacrifice brings peace to others, I go gladly."
"165399380-0-32990";"Don't get on Vori's bad side. She may look pleasant, but I heard she flayed a failing student. For botching their spell! Can't count how many times I've done the same."
"165399380-0-32998";"A pilgrim, I see. Vaermina's shrine lies just down the path. Worship will continue for some time."
"165399380-0-32999";"I'm glad we have two smaller stables instead of one big one. Working near my sister all day would drive me crazy!"
"165399380-0-33000";"A new face! That's a rare occurrence. Welcome to the Everfull Flagon!"
"165399380-0-33004";"You're not one of the Flagon regulars."
"165399380-0-33012";"Therich and I grew up in Daggerfall, but people there weren't very tolerant of our relationship. We moved here five years ago and instantly felt accepted.\n\nFunny how the smallest minds are found in the biggest cities, isn't it?"
"165399380-0-33015";"Talmo has been whining about his stupid flag for days. I'm glad it's gone!"
"165399380-0-33016";"So many refugees here, it's not an Imperial town anymore. I'll be glad when this war is over and the newcomers can go home."
"165399380-0-33017";"Why have you wandered into the Cliffs of Failure, mortal? Are you curious as to what you must face here? Do you wonder why we haven't destroyed you? Or why these mages are bound before us?\n\nI have answers, of course—if you are willing to listen."
"165399380-0-33018";"The land's plenty fertile. The main problem with farming here is armies tromping through—ruining fields, stealing livestock, and burning homes. All we can do is build and hope for the best."
"165399380-0-33019";"Has Therich talked to you about his dumb wall idea yet? Stick around long enough and he will. What a nut!"
"165399380-0-33020";"I don't see what's so ridiculous about building a wall around Vlastarus. We'd all be a lot safer!"
"165399380-0-33022";"I can't believe these chickens eat so much. Where do they put it all?"
"165399380-0-33029";"You have no idea what you just walked into. You should never have come here."
"165399380-0-33030";"Yes, yes. I see, I see. You would make a fine addition to my forces."
"165399380-0-33031";"Ah, a new recruit! Splendid! I have a good feeling about you. Yes, I really do.\n\nTogether, I'm sure we can win this contest. Good fortune follows me, or so I've been told."
"165399380-0-33033";"Cursed, Daedra take it! Cursed! A curse on all curses!"
"165399380-0-33050";"I don't know what I'm going to do about Darvell."
"165399380-0-33053";"Everyone thinks I'm crazy, even my wife."
"165399380-0-33054";"If it weren't for Vastae, I'd have left town a long time ago. Everyone here is so concerned about the fissure and earthquakes and such, they don't take the time to appreciate music. It'd do them some good to relax a little."
"165399380-0-33055";"I try to keep what's left of Chorrol as neat as I can. I hope to eventually plant a small spice garden. The food here is so bland!"
"165399380-0-33057";"You want to help? Walk along the fissure and watch for monsters."
"165399380-0-33062";"Halion is an unappreciated genius. Chorrol doesn't deserve him. Isn't he great?"
"165399380-0-33067";"The waters of life flow strongly through this village. Despite the dangers from the fissure, the people remain. I admire them, though I will not stay."
"165399380-0-33074";"What? My friend's looking for an heirloom that was put in the wrong coffin. Keep moving."
"165399380-0-33080";"There's never anything new here. The danger scared away the best merchants. Not that we have the money to buy anything, with Asvorn just hanging around the tavern all day and night."
"165399380-0-33083";"This is a cursed place, wayfarer. Satakal's flames will consume all who dwell here. I await the end. What sense to flee when all Cyrodiil burns?"
"165399380-0-33084";"Hard to believe there aren't any beds available in town. I think it's anti-Orc racism!"
"165399380-0-33086";"If you're looking for a bed, check at the Oak and Crosier. I'm full up."
"165399380-0-33087";"Times are hard here, stranger. If not for the help we get from Weynon Priory, this would be a ghost town."
"165399380-0-33155";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-33171";"<You can see a resemblence between this young man and Nelulin. This must be Iwelien, Velatosse's younger son.>"
"165399380-0-33175";"We have such lovely flowers here. I can think of a thousand places to plant them around the city."
"165399380-0-33181";"Why are you here? Why have you come searching for this damned fleet of the lost?"
"165399380-0-33184";"You'll be in my songs, friend.\n\nThank you."
"165399380-0-33185";"I could hear the giants howling from here. How many did you kill? A hundred? A thousand?"
"165399380-0-33224";"You … you came with us to stop Molag Bal, didn't you?\n\nI'm sorry you got caught up in this stupid game, too. Well, take my life. Finish me. I refuse to participate in this travesty."
"165399380-0-33225";"Stay away from Mim!\n\nDon't … don't make this one hurt you. Mim will win this game. Mim will beat everyone and get us out of here. All of us!"
"165399380-0-33226";"I can end this nightmare … one step and it would all be over. No more worries. No more unpleasant options. I wouldn't have to hurt anyone ….\n\nJust one single step."
"165399380-0-33227";"You came back. I was afraid I'd imagined our earlier discussion.\n\nMy mind plays tricks on me. Especially when the craving gets really bad."
"165399380-0-33233";"I see your skin is still on your bones. I searched the rest of the ship, but there's no sign of the journal. \n\nDid you have better luck?"
"165399380-0-33238";"What do you want? Can't a Nord drink in peace?"
"165399380-0-33251";"Well met, stranger. I suppose you demand a song."
"165399380-0-33277";"Maybe you can convince Ravila. She's actually talking about breaking the rules.\n\nBy the Tribunal, that's just not done!"
"165399380-0-33278";"Why does anyone care what I do? It's not like any of you are the boss of me."
"165399380-0-33279";"I think Ravila should be allowed to do what she wants. We're all free now, after all."
"165399380-0-33292";"What a creepy place! It feels like something's tugging at my mind.\n\nFind my brother and the scholars. And hurry! I don't know how long we can resist the binding spell."
"165399380-0-33306";"Did you see? The villagers. They're starting to remember.\n\nThe Thane threatened my daughter and I actually stood up to him. Of course, he knocked me down, but still. We're returning to our old selves!"
"165399380-0-33308";"My mind is clearing, I remember more and more. I was studying to be a healer once."
"165399380-0-33314";"Your interference will be tolerated. To a point."
"165399380-0-33344";"Welcome to the Everfull Flagon, friend. Have a mead. The first one is always on the house!"
"165399380-0-33352";"All the way from Narsis and we have to wait out here like common … commoners! I blame it on all this Pact nonsense."
"165399380-0-33353";"We avoid getting the plague, escape the Maulborn, and dodge falling anchors. So what happens? We get waylaid by Dunmer bureaucracy. Oh, the irony of it all!"
"165399380-0-33354";"The wheels of Mournhold turn exceedingly slow, but they do turn. I, for one, support their efforts. With these procedures in place, we remain safe and secure."
"165399380-0-33361";"Good to see you again, friend!"
"165399380-0-33362";"Lunk likes the pretty sky. And the rocks. Lunk likes rocks."
"165399380-0-33363";"I'm sticking with the Captain. If anyone can get us out of here, she can."
"165399380-0-33364";"This is a bad place. A very bad place. It chills my scales."
"165399380-0-33369";"Damn these crowds! We're going to lose our entire shipment!"
"165399380-0-33370";"The registrar still won't see us. And now our guar steaks are beginning to spoil in their carts."
"165399380-0-33385";"The Maulborn turned out to be evil. I never would have believed it!"
"165399380-0-33398";"Rats in the supplies. Lord Vivec sent them, I know it. Just as in the scriptures … a living parable!"
"165399380-0-33399";"You hold a knife one way, it cuts through an onion. Hold it another way, and it cuts through three Orcs in no time flat. Screams, carnage. Sorry, what can I get you?"
"165399380-0-33400";"Mother Almalexia teaches us that work is good for the soul. I believe her. But I wish that sleeping was good for the soul too."
"165399380-0-33404";"Avani's fires must be tended. Always. Dries my scales!"
"165399380-0-33411";"Look what I found: some long-lost relatives. The shock of seeing me has knocked them out from under the crown's control, but it won't last. \n\nThat be the crown right there. What're you going to do with it, mate?"
"165399380-0-33421";"I don't know what you did, but something changed! Everyone can feel it."
"165399380-0-33473";"Are you waiting to see the registrar, too? You're not the only one."
"165399380-0-33494";"I just returned from business outside the city. Now I can't even go back to my own home!"
"165399380-0-33497";"Why do we have to wait for the registrar? It's taking so long!"
"165399380-0-33498";"I'm tired of waiting for these silly little Elves to get their act together. I'll sell my rabbit meatballs right here."
"165399380-0-33501";"And another weary visitor washes up on Mournhold's crowded shores."
"165399380-0-33526";"I can't believe it. I haven't had good rabbit meatballs since I left Skyrim!"
"165399380-0-33532";"I don't know. Tillrani did keep us all safe for years. But Rana is captain now. We should listen to her, right?"
"165399380-0-33539";"A new contestant arrives, peering out from cold, cold eyes. But what does this mean? Only the Shadow Court can glean!\n\nChoose wisely or we shall see your demise!"
"165399380-0-33548";"Where do you think you're going? We're in line here."
"165399380-0-33551";"It feels like I've been waiting here forever."
"165399380-0-33552";"I don't think this line is ever going to move."
"165399380-0-33576";"No one may enter Daggerfall Castle without special permission at this time."
"165399380-0-33577";"We can't allow you to enter right now. My apologies."
"165399380-0-33578";"We can't wait any longer. As soon as the roads are clear, we need to get our caravans moving again."
"165399380-0-33579";"Belosi's orders are very, very precise. She wants to get her caravan back on the road as soon as possible."
"165399380-0-33580";"We must be cautious. I believe the Maulborn still pose a serious threat."
"165399380-0-33582";"We make many decisions in life that we truly believe are correct when we make them.\n\nThis body, for example. It was a gift from the lord of this realm. He said it would grant me the power to topple the corruption of Glenumbra. He lied."
"165399380-0-33649";"<The glowing crystal hums with power.>"
"165399380-0-33652";"Ebonheart this. Pact that. Bah! This alliance hasn't made any of you any cleaner.\n\nNow watch where you step. I just swept that spot."
"165399380-0-33653";"The damn registrars had me running all over the place. No more."
"165399380-0-33656";"Not now! I have to find it!"
"165399380-0-33657";"Travel in the Ashlands can be slow. I can sell you some strong legs to get you going."
"165399380-0-33658";"Oh, are you here to clean? I think the fire pit needs sweeping, and my daughter always leaves spell components in the corners. Be quick about it, please."
"165399380-0-33663";"This book is fascinating. It attempts to disprove the fourteenth law of arcane pyrodynamics by applying Magnus' theorem of non-conjoined thaumaturgic vectors to Geirmund's system of harmonic resonance. \n\nWhat do you think?"
"165399380-0-33666";"There is nothing you could possibly say that would interest me. Begone, netch fart."
"165399380-0-33667";"Such treatment! I shouldn't have to wait for the registrars. I'm not some … commoner!"
"165399380-0-33669";"Compared to the inside of a noble's home, I don't mind tending to a nice damp well. Smells ever so much better."
"165399380-0-33670";"I'm not a Dark Elf. Apparently she thinks she could get preferential treatment.\n\nGuess what? We're both waiting."
"165399380-0-33671";"Got to get the old planks ready. The Perch are biting off the coast!"
"165399380-0-33675";"Have you ever just stood and gazed into the water? The river flows through us all. Truly."
"165399380-0-33685";"By the Three, your gear looks worn. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-33687";"My father's the best armorsmith in all the Ashlands. Just ask him."
"165399380-0-33694";"Things were easier for me before the Telvanni decided to abscond with all of their knowledge and goods.\n\nBut, no matter. Can I be of assistance?"
"165399380-0-33711";"I love this place! Kemirik knows how to show his customers a good time."
"165399380-0-33813";"How positively exciting! You have won the game that could not be won. You defied the laws of this realm.\n\nOh, well done! Well done!"
"165399380-0-33814";"Leave me! You must take the others and go. That is your only option."
"165399380-0-33815";"When you make your final decision, remember the reason we all came to this dreadful realm. You must select whoever you feel will best serve you in the battles ahead.\n\nWhatever you decide, I know it will be the correct choice."
"165399380-0-33816";"I had allies and friends once. I understand this was not an easy choice for you.\n\nHelp me restore my mortal self and you will have my support. On this, you have my word."
"165399380-0-33817";"Yes, yes. You decided to serve me because I have the best chance to win. I understand that. You want to survive.\n\nListen to what I say and do not question my orders. Do this and we shall escape this game."
"165399380-0-33820";"How good to see you again! And on the winning side! Wonderful!\n\nMy dear friend Relmus told me so much about you. As I told Relmus, if you help me, I shall help you. It's as simple as that."
"165399380-0-33827";"Molag Bal plays such cruel games with the people of his realm.\n\nTo put those who have failed in their life in a never ending battle, it's just, I don't want to think about it.\n\nI'm thankful that you saved me. What now?"
"165399380-0-33868";"You have come to Haj Uxith in its most desperate hour."
"165399380-0-33875";"I grieve to see Khajiit like those on the streets below."
"165399380-0-33877";"Not an ideal post, but I'm sure this is temporary."
"165399380-0-33878";"By the end of each day, Jul-dar is exhausted."
"165399380-0-33879";"Welcome to my wife's inn! Please, make yourself at home."
"165399380-0-33880";"The dust makes cleaning impossible, so why try too hard, yes?"
"165399380-0-33881";"Why must we work so hard for so little?"
"165399380-0-33883";"I sharpen my claws against the stones. It feels good."
"165399380-0-33884";"There's no reason we can't all get along, provided the ale flows."
"165399380-0-33885";"They say all cats are grey at night, but I don't believe it."
"165399380-0-33886";"The winds singe my fur! I can't wait to leave this place."
"165399380-0-33897";"House Hlaalu maintains a very strong presence in Mournhold. We support free trade throughout the Ebonheart Pact."
"165399380-0-33924";"Do you make a habit of entering homes that clearly don't belong to you? Please leave at once!"
"165399380-0-33935";"If you're here for the auction, you're early.\n\nWe only show the merchandise on Middas and Fredas."
"165399380-0-33937";"Cause no trouble, and I'll cause no pain."
"165399380-0-33941";"The dead may not speak, but they have so much to say."
"165399380-0-33948";"The other houses are jealous of House Dres."
"165399380-0-33951";"We disagree about many things, outsider, but it all comes down to this: our Hist tree is dying.\n\nBah! I will say no more until you have passed the Trials of Body and Spirit."
"165399380-0-33969";"We're still getting set up, fair traveler. Offer you something to tide you over?"
"165399380-0-33971";"Perhaps Venthin will listen to you. An alliance is Morrowind's best hope."
"165399380-0-34159";"Best stay back, citizen. Those people are from the cursed town of Phaer. They might be carriers of a deadly plague."
"165399380-0-34201";"Did you hear about the magister? The Ordinators are keeping it quiet, but I heard it was murder.\n\nWhat a pity. He was a favorite of Almalexia."
"165399380-0-34202";"I don't know who you are, but I know you shouldn't be here."
"165399380-0-34206";"A well-balanced blade that holds its edge and cuts without effort? Priceless.\n\nHow many can I get you?"
"165399380-0-34221";"The right tool for the right job, I always say. If you've got the gold, I'm sure I can provide you with the right tool.\n\nThe rest is up to you."
"165399380-0-34223";"My secret to a great sauce? Pork fat and a barrel of butter!"
"165399380-0-34224";"Free samples? If you want charity, go bother someone in the Tribunal Temple."
"165399380-0-34225";"One good thing about war: business is booming. And that means profits continue to rise."
"165399380-0-34226";"Our techniques may not be as fancy as the master smiths on the other side of the city, but our metal is just as strong."
"165399380-0-34227";"Ma crafts all our armor. If it doesn't fit, she'll be happy to resize it for you."
"165399380-0-34228";"Mournhold has become a dangerous place, friend. All of Deshaan, really.\n\nYou don't want to be caught without a sturdy weapon when an enemy appears."
"165399380-0-34229";"Step right up! No need to wait! I can put you in a fine suit of armor before the grass waves in the afternoon breeze."
"165399380-0-34232";"I make leather look good. And my armor will do wonders for you, too. Ready to buy something?"
"165399380-0-34243";"Hold on, hold on.\n\nWhere do you think you're going? Are you mad?"
"165399380-0-34245";"To have come so far, and be turned away at the gate. Damn the Skywatch guard!"
"165399380-0-34246";"Don't, don't come closer. I can feel the fluid in my throat now."
"165399380-0-34247";"I can't believe they won't let us in. We pay coin into the Queen's purse like everybody else!"
"165399380-0-34248";"You'll want to keep back. Who knows if the damned of Phaer are catching?"
"165399380-0-34251";"I grow weary of conversation. House Dres requires no help from lesser creatures."
"165399380-0-34259";"Don't feel bad for this one. He got what was coming to him."
"165399380-0-34278";"Thou wouldst speak to me? Thousands of years, the highest arcana, and I must speak to you? Ahem. \n\nWhat may I get you, valued customer?"
"165399380-0-34281";"Yeah, you're fine. Go on through. These folks still need to pass inspection."
"165399380-0-34290";"Welcome to the city of Skywatch, and the Festival of Defiance. Can I answer any questions for you?"
"165399380-0-34306";"This one was told Perch are running today. Best get out there while you can."
"165399380-0-34334";"In town for the celebration, are you? You'll find all manner of debauchery here, if you're one to debauch, that is."
"165399380-0-34336";"Buy a sword, get a mug of mead! You won't get a better deal than that, and I can tell you from experience, this batch isn't half bad."
"165399380-0-34337";"I can't wait until closing time. I don't want to miss the drinking contest! Thane Jeggi is sure to win. And his victory belch is a wonder to behold!"
"165399380-0-34345";"This woman will live. I have made sure of that. She is too valuable to lose so early in the contest.\n\nYou may have accomplished her task, but I know she will help me in the end. For this reason, her life is not forfeit."
"165399380-0-34347";"So you ended up with my rune? Interesting. You're either working with the cat or you killed him. I'd prefer the latter, of course, but perhaps that's just me.\n\nStill, there's a way for everyone to win today."
"165399380-0-34353";"Do you see my court jester? Isn't he handsome? In life, I knew him and other members of the Shadow Court. We worked together on more than one occasion. Doesn't he dance like a Daedra?\n\nOh, but you must be wondering why I'm here to greet you."
"165399380-0-34368";"Honor and faith. Please keep your distance from the door. This ruin is off limits to those such as you."
"165399380-0-34394";"No time to talk, I'm getting out of here!"
"165399380-0-34415";"This one never expected this development."
"165399380-0-34433";"<The researcher shows signs of being savagely mauled.>"
"165399380-0-34434";"<The claw marks on her back suggest this researcher was trying to escape the ruins when she was attacked by a mist tiger.>"
"165399380-0-34435";"<The researcher's body has stab wounds and claw marks, consistent with a spriggan attack.>"
"165399380-0-34459";"Please help me—these women are crazy, they're going to kill me for no reason!"
"165399380-0-34460";"Turn around and leave. This pitiful excuse for a man has wronged all three of us. It's none of your business."
"165399380-0-34461";"Don't interrupt me while I'm working!"
"165399380-0-34462";"Never enough provisions, but we do what we can."
"165399380-0-34463";"This will be Erning's last picnic. I hope he enjoys it."
"165399380-0-34465";"Erning is a three-timing bastard. He gets whatever Adrienne gives him. I think she's looking for an excuse not to kill him though. Maybe just maim him a little…."
"165399380-0-34472";"Got gold? Spend it here. Don't waste your money on the trash for sale by other merchants!"
"165399380-0-34476";"Best deals in town—quality goods, no watered-down ale or stale beer here!"
"165399380-0-34477";"I heard the Maulborn have spies in the city. Maybe that's what all this fuss is about."
"165399380-0-34494";"Seems silly, doesn't it? Sweeping the front porch when our house is in ruins. I just don't know what else to do.\n\nAt least no one's tried to stab me in the last few days."
"165399380-0-34496";"That was an impressive bit of work. I was right to doubt <<1>>'s claims about the amulet. Thank you for sparing my hide that bit of unpleasantness."
"165399380-0-34497";"Is it still after me?"
"165399380-0-34499";"You should get out of here. Imperial troops assume everyone new is here to support the rebellion."
"165399380-0-34504";"Did you really just leap down into this slime pit?\n\nYou're either remarkably brave or really stupid. My guess? A little of both."
"165399380-0-34565";"I can do this. I really can. All I have to do is … oh, who am I kidding? I can't do this! There's no way!\n\nWhy did I ever think I could make it in the Fighters Guild?"
"165399380-0-34568";"Yeah? What do you want?"
"165399380-0-34571";"The stronghold is under attack!"
"165399380-0-34576";"You have my eternal thanks!"
"165399380-0-34620";"Some of those Dunmer travelers invited me for a drink. They probably want to see what a drunk Argonian looks like."
"165399380-0-34621";"Can't talk. I'm on duty. Last time I did, I got latrine cleaning for a month. Not going to make that mistake again.\n\nBloody Sovngarde, I'm doing it again!"
"165399380-0-34626";"The dead outnumber the living in Cheydinhal. Sometimes I wonder which group is better off."
"165399380-0-34629";"This isn't a safe place for anyone not in the Imperial army. Get across the river!"
"165399380-0-34639";"My family has lived here for three generations. Now our home is gone, all gone."
"165399380-0-34642";"Just let me rest. Hilio is doing all he can, for me and the others. Nothing you can do."
"165399380-0-34643";"Get away! This is my hiding place—go find your own!"
"165399380-0-34644";"So many dead and wounded. No cause is worth this!"
"165399380-0-34645";"If I can just fix this old cart, Junia and I can load up our few remaining possessions and get out of here."
"165399380-0-34647";"<You recognize this figure's familiar face from the images projected by the Speaking Stones. It is none other than Eboric Direfrost, his features frozen in abject horror.>"
"165399380-0-34650";"Ah, a new guest has joined our little party! And will you provide amusement and interesting diversion? I think you just might, at that!"
"165399380-0-34661";"You have questions, yes?"
"165399380-0-34666";"You aren't one of our soldiers."
"165399380-0-34669";"<Borgath obviously hasn't been dead very long.>"
"165399380-0-34674";"Have no fear. I shall be free in a moment.\n\nBut why wait when you're standing right there. A little help, please."
"165399380-0-34700";"You helped us get out of that terrible place. I won't forget that."
"165399380-0-34701";"I was almost out of those ropes, but I still appreciate your help. Thanks."
"165399380-0-34725";"This is no place to dally, friend. I'm waiting for the Vicecanons to arrive as soon as they've stabilized Stormhold.\n\nUntil then, travel on this road is not advised."
"165399380-0-34729";"You so much as smirk and I'll gut you."
"165399380-0-34730";"Talk fast, stranger. You look like a spy to me."
"165399380-0-34733";"This poor soldier. He didn't have to die. At least the Khajiit got away. How long can he manage to survive, though, I don't know. My clan can be very persistent."
"165399380-0-34746";"Welcome to the Hissing Guar! How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-34754";"This one doesn't understand the game the little Elf and the snake thing are playing, but we have something important to do! We need to get into this tower. The key to our victory, it's in there! I know this to be true!"
"165399380-0-34755";"We shall help you enter the tower. But first, you must help us against these foul Wood Elves. Do not listen to their lies!\n\nThey murder our children! For no reason! Please, you must help me save the little ones!"
"165399380-0-34756";"By the First Forge! Welcome, bloodkin."
"165399380-0-34761";"I may be sleeping in this tent by myself. Jena refuses to leave our house, battered as it is. If you heard that thing groan with every breeze, you'd be sleeping out here too."
"165399380-0-34762";"Have you seen Brielus? Is he still setting up that stupid tent? He thinks our house is about to fall down, but I'll chance it. I'm not sleeping in a tent."
"165399380-0-34765";"Look at these. Water damage. Loose ropes. It's amazing they survived at all.\n\nDid you need something?"
"165399380-0-34770";"Who are you and why are you here? Stop staring at me!"
"165399380-0-34777";"Where is everyone? No more drinkers in town?"
"165399380-0-34778";"Are you the new bartender? More mead!"
"165399380-0-34806";"By Malacath's bloody mace, I feel so much better! That unbearable cloud of fear and confusion has finally lifted. I assume that this is your doing?"
"165399380-0-34809";"You should not be here. This place is dangerous."
"165399380-0-34811";"I know, I know. The signal fire is out. There's nothing I can do though. I had just stepped outside to relieve myself and all these slavers came out of nowhere. \n\nHow was I to stop them? I'm a lighthouse keeper—not a soldier."
"165399380-0-34825";"Do you have a comb? These damn slavers messed up my hair."
"165399380-0-34827";"I'm in your debt. I will pray for Rupta to guide you in all your journeys."
"165399380-0-34828";"Knowing that Captain Angarthal is dead will keep me warm for many nights to come. You fight well, friend."
"165399380-0-34857";"Anyone who wants to join the Fighters Guild in Mournhold has to talk to me. Are you good in a fight? Ready to serve and protect? While the army is off to war, it falls to us to deal with the Daedra.\n\nLet me know if you want to sign up."
"165399380-0-34858";"You enter the Mages Guild at a most difficult time, friend. Please bear with us."
"165399380-0-34859";"Even in our time of grief, the work of the Mages Guild must go on."
"165399380-0-34860";"The Mages Guild always has numerous irons in the fire. We could always use some help."
"165399380-0-34861";"Why are you still here?\n\nThe one person in this entire place that has free rein to come and go as you please, and you come back? I'll never understand some people."
"165399380-0-34864";"What's going to happen to us? Why won't they let us leave the city?"
"165399380-0-34866";"Since you're working for Councilor Ralden, you've been granted access to come and go as you please.\n\nDon't abuse the privilege. And don't disappoint these people. They're counting on you."
"165399380-0-34872";"I'm sure you must find my predicament endlessly amusing."
"165399380-0-34873";"The plague is coming and they lock down the city!\n\nThey're going to get us all killed."
"165399380-0-34874";"They have no right to do this.\n\nI have family in Mournhold. We know it's safe there. The Tribunal would never let harm come to their city."
"165399380-0-34875";"Do I look feverish to you? We should never have left Eastmarch."
"165399380-0-34880";"I'll recover. Don't let them send me home, please! I want to make my father proud and return as a Thalmor guard."
"165399380-0-34881";"Don't look at this one with pity in your eyes! This one is tougher than she looks, I promise you. I will finish this cursed school and join the Thalmor to protect the Dominion."
"165399380-0-34882";"This one just has to stay strong, a while longer. This one is sure they'll send us to the Thalmor soon. Right?"
"165399380-0-34883";"I won't let them beat me. I won't! This is all just part of the training, to make us strong, right?"
"165399380-0-34897";"Ha ha! Look at the poor fool, Adima. Does he think he can defeat your mistress in her own realm?"
"165399380-0-34899";"It would be amusing, Count Hosni, if his insolence weren't so insulting. But he'll get his comeuppance. I just hope we're there to see it."
"165399380-0-34917";"What are you doing here? Get away from our prisoner!"
"165399380-0-34995";"I've got weapons if you've got coin. Let's keep this brief, eh?"
"165399380-0-35019";"If our queen could see us, she'd send help immediately!"
"165399380-0-35020";"This is madness. Why wasn't <<1>> around to stop these pirates?"
"165399380-0-35021";"Have we met? Got knocked on the head by one of the pirates. I think it was a pirate.\n\nI don't feel so good."
"165399380-0-35022";"Pirates or not, I have wares to move. Schedules don't keep themselves."
"165399380-0-35023";"No matter what happens, we must honor our commitment to the Fighters Guild."
"165399380-0-35027";"Bloody black-hearts! I sailed out as the pirates sailed in. Their mages blasted my boat!\n\nBarely made it to shore. If I can't fish, how do I find the gold to fix this thing?"
"165399380-0-35030";"Sharp. Pointed. Makes a clear statement to your enemies.\n\nNobody will make swords for you but Zhosh, so get them right here."
"165399380-0-35031";"I don't know why everyone's standing around. We don't fish? We won't eat!"
"165399380-0-35033";"Look, I just want to do what's right. Anyone who wants to grab a pole can fish, but I won't turn over our catch for free."
"165399380-0-35034";"We're all tired, we're all frightened, and we're all hungry! I just want to make sure I get my fair share!"
"165399380-0-35039";"You look like you could use a drink. Listen well, friend. Ale makes everything better."
"165399380-0-35042";"My food isn't anything to write home about, but it is hot and filling. Let me get you something."
"165399380-0-35043";"I drink, therefore I brew. Heehee. Just a little brewer humor.\n\nCan I get you something wet and wondrous to drink?"
"165399380-0-35048";"Bless you for what you've done! I never thought we'd see our homes again."
"165399380-0-35049";"<<1>> really acquitted himself.\n\nHe's no <<2>>, you understand, but few people are."
"165399380-0-35050";"Enough with <<1>>, I say. <<2>> has room for one hero, and I say it's <<3>>!"
"165399380-0-35051";"I fed one of the pirates to a strangler. He kept screaming, even when he was inside it. Not sure how to feel about that."
"165399380-0-35060";"Welcome to Daggerfall, stranger. Enjoy your stay."
"165399380-0-35061";"Go away. Leave me be. There's nothing for you here."
"165399380-0-35066";"Seems like the war in Cyrodiil never ends. We need more soldiers willing to do their part. That's the only way we'll win this damn war."
"165399380-0-35068";"<This Veiled Heritance officer looks like he was killed recently.>"
"165399380-0-35073";"Our Lady Almalexia has asked us to keep an eye on Vox's forces until her champion arrives.\n\nWe'll make our stand here if her troops attempt to leave this place. Though we may fall in battle, we do so in the name of our Lady."
"165399380-0-35084";"Who are you? And why are you dragging that frost witch behind you?\n\nOut with it."
"165399380-0-35106";"Outrageous! What kind of protection can the vicecanons offer if they can't protect a Dunmer in his own home!"
"165399380-0-35109";"The dryskins do not welcome our prayers. But they are confused.\n\nI don't pray for their dead. I pray for those who live in these dark times."
"165399380-0-35130";"I thought it'd be safe for us here in Riften after we escaped Northwind. But just look at this place …."
"165399380-0-35134";"Finally, we're away from those Reach bastards."
"165399380-0-35135";"I saw horrible things at the mine. Is anyone trying to save the ones who didn't escape?"
"165399380-0-35142";"You know the deceased? I do hope so. Too many people have come, as if this is a spectacle for entertainment.\n\nBow your head as you leave. The Hist watches us all."
"165399380-0-35143";"All must return to the swamps, eventually. We are but borrowing a spark of life from the world. It must be passed on for life to continue.\n\nTake comfort in that, if nothing else."
"165399380-0-35163";"Please don't tell the guards we're here. We need a place to stay, just for a little while."
"165399380-0-35164";"We've been watching this place. No one lives here anymore. Just leave us be. I'm only trying to keep my family safe."
"165399380-0-35166";"Lookin' for armor? I'm your man. What'll it be?"
"165399380-0-35185";"Greetings. Please excuse the mess. Sinmur has disrupted everything."
"165399380-0-35186";"Welcome, friend. How may I help you?"
"165399380-0-35188";"Welcome to Menoit's Emporium. If I don't have what you need, then you don't really need it."
"165399380-0-35210";"Be quiet! Those thugs haven't found me yet. I can stay down here for days."
"165399380-0-35214";"The Midnight Union's retreated—and I never got a chance to clout one of them!"
"165399380-0-35215";"I guess I'll be replanting half the field. But thanks for saving what you did."
"165399380-0-35233";"This horse is not for sale. So don't ask."
"165399380-0-35234";"Well, what'll it be? Don't waste my time."
"165399380-0-35257";"Once we defeat the Imperials, we can start rebuilding Cheydinhal. We must re-take this town!"
"165399380-0-35331";"Looking for something specific?"
"165399380-0-35333";"Sorry, little busy here. Speak to Hadriss if you need something."
"165399380-0-35335";"Keep walking, hero. If I had business with you, you'd never see me coming."
"165399380-0-35336";"Armor is like tree bark—a tough outer coating protecting the tender insides."
"165399380-0-35389";"Are they gone yet? Damned cats nearly ate me!"
"165399380-0-35401";"Well, what is it? I've got a lot to do today."
"165399380-0-35420";"As soon as I can, I'm leaving this cursed town. I've been indentured to these Nords far too long."
"165399380-0-35422";"Is Thane Fjora still alive? I couldn't stay in Nimalten anymore. Who knew that Riften was even worse?"
"165399380-0-35423";"May your sword always strike true!"
"165399380-0-35424";"I pray for the souls of those we have lost. You should do the same."
"165399380-0-35426";"Don't mind Akarn. He's surly until he's drunk."
"165399380-0-35433";"Sorry, just enough mead for us two. Go find your own!"
"165399380-0-35434";"Dark clouds gather over Aldcroft. You don't need magicka to see that."
"165399380-0-35462";"Never extend your claws unless you intend to use them. The same is true of magic. If you're going to cast a spell, you may as well unleash a monsoon of magicka."
"165399380-0-35483";"Welcome to Shadehome. Need a bed for the night?"
"165399380-0-35485";"Yes, I sample my own wares. What of it? With all that's been going on out there, we all deserve a few drinks."
"165399380-0-35486";"First time Mari's been able to sleep since Sinmur's attack. Please don't wake her."
"165399380-0-35489";"The secret to my wonderful physique? Why, I cook my own food, of course."
"165399380-0-35492";"We're hanging by a thread here. One more setback and we've lost this war."
"165399380-0-35494";"Bed and brew. We've got the best of both! Just go on in and see my wife, Bolfrosti. She'll get you set up."
"165399380-0-35495";"Ready for a real battle?"
"165399380-0-35500";"Hey there! Skills getting rusty or looking for new ones?"
"165399380-0-35502";"What sort of gear are you missing?"
"165399380-0-35503";"Hey, I saw you earlier! Next to the injured elf girl.\n\nGlad you could help her and, well, everyone here. Don't suppose you'd be willing to help me with something as well?"
"165399380-0-35504";"When the guild calls, all must answer."
"165399380-0-35507";"You want to poke someone with something sharp? Come talk to me!"
"165399380-0-35509";"Do Guar look … tasty to you?"
"165399380-0-35512";"Greetings, traveler. Not even Sinmur can shut us down!"
"165399380-0-35515";"Sorry, can't help you. Too much paperwork. Go talk to someone else."
"165399380-0-35517";"I've found that my workers perform better when I watch them closely.\n\nTakes a lot of effort on my part, but productivity has never been better."
"165399380-0-35521";"Did you take my favorite pole? Someone did."
"165399380-0-35529";"I have the finest woven cloth in the north. What is it you're looking for?"
"165399380-0-35531";"Ignore Eager. His shadow frightens him and it's dark in here. Nimalten's a nice place, full of friendly folk!"
"165399380-0-35532";"I was told Eastmarch was a nice place. It wasn't. So I came here. And what did I find? Bandits, Reachmen, giants. \n\nI should dig a hole to live in."
"165399380-0-35533";"First it was bandits attacking on the roads, now Fjora is attacked right here in town. I'm sick of it."
"165399380-0-35536";"This store was my life. What now, retire?"
"165399380-0-35544";"Don't worry about us, stranger. The giant made a mess of things, but we'll rebuild.\n\nI hope someone kills that thing, and soon."
"165399380-0-35557";"We were thinking of starting a family. But now? Everything we'd worked for, gone in an instant."
"165399380-0-35561";"The fish aren't biting anymore. Something's scaring them off."
"165399380-0-35562";"The Covenant sends troops here to watch over us. Are we children?"
"165399380-0-35564";"These are joyless times in Riften."
"165399380-0-35566";"One moment. I'm reading."
"165399380-0-35567";"I appreciate Sifvid taking me in and giving me work here. But it's been five years. Any longer and I'll grow scales and gills. I want to see the world. You know what I mean?"
"165399380-0-35571";"I can hardly wait to strike the bandits. Until then, we train."
"165399380-0-35573";"I love listening to songbirds. So does Dimi!"
"165399380-0-35574";"I may not have everything you want, I'm afraid. Those Red Rook thugs help themselves to my stock and leave me precious little to sell."
"165399380-0-35577";"Take care. The shrine downstream was once a site of great evil. Perhaps it still is, as the fishing is poor here."
"165399380-0-35578";"Greetings, adventurer. Come, check out the finest that Nimalten has to offer!"
"165399380-0-35581";"Welcome to my inn. A room for the night, a meal, or both?"
"165399380-0-35585";"If you find a hair in your drink, blame the dog. Mutt sheds like a dead pine."
"165399380-0-35589";"Another time, friend."
"165399380-0-35591";"Hungry? I got anything you'd want right here."
"165399380-0-35592";"Bandits ambushed my companions and me while we escorted these merchants here. Poor bandits."
"165399380-0-35593";"I've got a stalwart band of mercenaries at my back. What more could I ask for?"
"165399380-0-35601";"The last person that made a joke about my cooking ended up wearing a pot of stew. Just saying."
"165399380-0-35603";"Well, I must say, I was quite annoyed with those Red Rook ruffians. They took anything that wasn't nailed down."
"165399380-0-35605";"Much obliged to you for all your help."
"165399380-0-35607";"Prepared to learn the intricacies of our craft?"
"165399380-0-35608";"In these times, the talents of all mages are welcome."
"165399380-0-35609";"How can I help outfit you?"
"165399380-0-35610";"Don't fool with alchemy unless you know what you're doing!"
"165399380-0-35611";"The Rift may be falling apart, but at least the guild library is still here."
"165399380-0-35612";"The rare and unusual are my specialty. Care to look?"
"165399380-0-35613";"Organizing these books is a losing cause. Mages are such slobs."
"165399380-0-35614";"Enter our hall, friend. Unlike some guilds, all are welcome here."
"165399380-0-35619";"Feast yer eyes, pilgrim! The great Vithon Battlewolf and his, er, battle wolf. We won't see his likes again, as Mother always said, curse her tongue."
"165399380-0-35622";"I don't know why they didn't just kill us all."
"165399380-0-35624";"I wish those two would shut up. I can't hear myself think."
"165399380-0-35625";"Nothing on those pirates' belts but empty pockets.\n\nI suppose that makes sense. They came here hoping to fill them."
"165399380-0-35634";"Bloody pirates, swimming up from below!\n\nI should get down to the hold, help finish them off. But, oh, it hurts …."
"165399380-0-35641";"Pirate mages blasted the deck. If I don't put out the cinders, the Prowler will go up like a torch!"
"165399380-0-35644";"Don't get a blade from those other guys. They're rubbish! Buy from me!"
"165399380-0-35652";"We were destined to meet. Why are you saving so much from my low, low prices? It is your destiny."
"165399380-0-35653";"Ten days in the cage for two underweight fish. Seems a little extreme, doesn't it?"
"165399380-0-35656";"Shoulda chopped off that bum's hands, insteadda throwin' him in the cage. Gives us all a bad name."
"165399380-0-35657";"Welcome. How can I help you today?"
"165399380-0-35658";"Walk with courage."
"165399380-0-35665";"Yes? What is it?"
"165399380-0-35676";"I have plenty to sell. And I've saved you a trip to the market!"
"165399380-0-35679";"If you can find these goods cheaper … well, you'll have to walk pretty far to find bargains like this."
"165399380-0-35681";"I was up all night reading this book. But I'm so close to being done. Just a few more chapters, I promise."
"165399380-0-35682";"I always prefer a walk in the country to a crowded marketplace."
"165399380-0-35686";"How may I help?"
"165399380-0-35687";"We meet across a crowded table of goods. We lock eyes. \n\nAnd I ask you what you want to buy."
"165399380-0-35690";"Oh, hello. I saw you coming. Last week, I believe it was."
"165399380-0-35701";"Praise to the Three! Can you spare a bit of gold for one of Almalexia's faithful?"
"165399380-0-35702";"Damn, but you live up to your reputation. I guess I'll have to tell Raz his obnoxious crowing was spot on."
"165399380-0-35709";"Almalexia be praised! Such wisdom and faith to emerge from the mouth of an Argonian."
"165399380-0-35710";"What a strange and beautiful land this is. It's so very different from Skyrim."
"165399380-0-35712";"An Argonian singing the praises of the Three? That's just not … right."
"165399380-0-35713";"I never thought I'd see the day. An Argonian, walking free and worshiping the Tribunal. It's … inspiring."
"165399380-0-35714";"All our meager belongings … lost."
"165399380-0-35715";"These poor excuses for soldiers need to get into shape! We'll never re-take Camlorn with this sorry bunch."
"165399380-0-35716";"Well, hello there. Enjoying the scenery back here?"
"165399380-0-35718";"I have as much sympathy as the next soldier, but I don't think I can take much more of this woman's incessant whining."
"165399380-0-35719";"Those damn marauders! My egg-sister hasn't stopped weeping since they robbed us."
"165399380-0-35723";"I can't abide by all this fog and rain. I miss the bright sun and the heat of the desert."
"165399380-0-35724";"I'm proud to be part of the Lion Guard."
"165399380-0-35726";"Please, can you spare anything to help my egg-family?"
"165399380-0-35733";"A squire's job is harder than you might imagine. We tend to the horses and care for the armor and weapons. If it's not shiny and sharp, the officers take it out of our hides!"
"165399380-0-35735";"How rude! I'm trying to have some peaceful contemplation time out here."
"165399380-0-35737";"If Rigurt sent you, you're wasting your time."
"165399380-0-35738";"Stay away from those chickens! It's my duty to guard them and I take my duty very seriously."
"165399380-0-35739";"Such amazingly large mushrooms! How do they grow so big?"
"165399380-0-35742";"I miss the swamp already, but I'm also looking forward to attending the Academy."
"165399380-0-35752";"The Lion Guard showed up and practically took over. I've been with the town watch for a long time and I've never seen Aldcroft this busy."
"165399380-0-35756";"No matter the trouble, people always want something to drink. Sad but true. And I always have plenty of business."
"165399380-0-35757";"What are we going to do with all these refugees from Camlorn? And what about Hircine's curse? I heard that some of the refugees are actually werewolves!"
"165399380-0-35765";"The Lion Guard are amazing. I'd sign up in an instant if I didn't have Marguerite to worry about."
"165399380-0-35766";"Leave me be, pup. I have fish to catch!"
"165399380-0-35767";"Don't mind my father. He's a bit of a grump. But he does make a tasty fish stew."
"165399380-0-35779";"The refugees make such a mess. They should all go back to wherever it was they came from."
"165399380-0-35783";"Metal's just like anything else. Raise the heat high enough, and it'll do anything you want. \n\nSee anything you like?"
"165399380-0-35792";"Sadly, there's little more I can do for these poor people. I'm at the limit of my abilities."
"165399380-0-35797";"Just because the Lion Guard has set up in town, that doesn't mean the town watch can slack off.\n\nWe won't relinquish our duties to a bunch of fancy-pants soldiers. Not on my watch!"
"165399380-0-35807";"You know, it's good not to be the weirdest thing in town for a change."
"165399380-0-35808";"I'm just here to eat. A soldier's gotta eat."
"165399380-0-35810";"We're happy to help our neighbors, but how long are they planning to stick around? You know the old saying, guests and fish start to stink after three days."
"165399380-0-35828";"Who are you? Speak quickly!"
"165399380-0-35850";"With the Covenant guards and Fighters Guild here, I don't think we'll have to worry about the Red Rooks anymore."
"165399380-0-35859";"Miraculous. To think that the Dwemer of old Volenfell settled as far as Stros M'Kai! \n\nMy brother and I have scoured the ruin's exterior for some time now, but we have never been able to get inside."
"165399380-0-35864";"I don't care who's fighting who. There's always more laundry."
"165399380-0-35871";"I'm a long way from home, but my work never changes."
"165399380-0-35872";"I'm good … It's a wonderful thing, traveling.\n\nSo much interes-intra … new. Like-like Breton wine. So interes- … it's great stuff."
"165399380-0-35874";"Welcome to Shor's Stone. Are you hear to help against the Worm Cult?"
"165399380-0-35876";"Did you happen to see a beautiful woman with fiery red hair walk out of the inn? Yeah, neither did I. Damn."
"165399380-0-35877";"Everyone wants to stable a horse, but I'm the only one who cleans up the next day."
"165399380-0-35878";"On a day like this, nothing tastes as good as a mug of cider."
"165399380-0-35881";"Crosswych needs a stronger Mages Guild presence."
"165399380-0-35884";"Delicious. This is delicious!"
"165399380-0-35886";"I've been writing a letter to my family. They keep asking questions about politics here, but I don't have answers for them."
"165399380-0-35887";"I don't ask questions. I just keep working."
"165399380-0-35895";"I haven't seen anything suspicious. And I'm not looking for trouble."
"165399380-0-35896";"Take it from me: the best garments are the ones you make yourself. I've got some goods that might help, if you're interested."
"165399380-0-35902";"I might have some things that would interest you. My collection is quite extensive."
"165399380-0-35905";"I've got to get these nuts to Mister Rodynak. He's paying me to haul them down to that Redguard camp later today.\n\nIf the knights won't let them into the market, we'll bring the market to them."
"165399380-0-35908";"All day long, I work as a carpenter. Then I get to come home and work on my house."
"165399380-0-35909";"We sealed up the well in case the Pact tries this route again, but we still need to get fresh water!"
"165399380-0-35914";"I don't like this. I don't like this at all. An army of Redguards down there, and the Knights of the Flame don't look happy to see them.\n\nMight be a good time to take that vacation I've been planning."
"165399380-0-35915";"I'll talk to anyone who wants to join the Fighters Guild … and a few people who won't."
"165399380-0-35917";"There's danger ahead. You'll need more than a weapon and armor."
"165399380-0-35918";"I'm sure Dalen is fine. I probably shouldn't worry."
"165399380-0-35919";"I know that a fight isn't always won by the soldier with the best weapons or gear.\n\nYour survival depends on skill."
"165399380-0-35925";"For those with an aptitude for magic, the Mages Guild provides endless opportunity."
"165399380-0-35926";"I hate this nonsense between the Duke and those Redguards. \n\nI need a book from my room, but Master Curmalen insists we have to stay out here. Neutrality be damned!"
"165399380-0-35930";"I don't just drink. I study. I research.\n\nIn fact, I do a lot of research."
"165399380-0-35932";"I'm writing a very polite letter to the duke.\n\nThen I'm going to tie it to a rock and throw it at Alcaire Castle."
"165399380-0-35934";"I was going to sell apples today, but someone started throwing them at people. Then the guards shut me down.\n\nNow everyone gets rocks for free instead. Go figure."
"165399380-0-35938";"Let's see. Apples, apples, apples … as long as I'm baking with apples today, I'll do fine.\n\nWhat can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-35945";"Don't mind me. I'm just a groundskeeper here and this place needs careful inspecting. The captain wants this place spit-shining.\n\nHe gets like that every time there's a hit of trouble, always finding every bleeding little fault."
"165399380-0-35947";"Stay safe."
"165399380-0-35957";"My wife hunts game. I hunt for bargains."
"165399380-0-35958";"I've got a little of this, a little of that."
"165399380-0-35992";"So many choices! I can't decide."
"165399380-0-36000";"That's a great inn, but I can't stay in there all day drinking. Sometimes, I need to step outside and get some air."
"165399380-0-36012";"So many wolves. I hate wolves. Always preferred cats myself."
"165399380-0-36017";"Watch your step, stranger."
"165399380-0-36018";"I watch the guards. The guards watch me.\n\nWe understand each other."
"165399380-0-36020";"I don't know you. Be on your way."
"165399380-0-36021";"Why are you here, stranger? When will you leave?"
"165399380-0-36022";"We've claimed this house as part of our encampment.\n\nThat means you should turn around and walk out. Good day to you."
"165399380-0-36023";"Dangerous times. If we are lucky, Ruptga walks with us."
"165399380-0-36024";"Who are you? I do not know you."
"165399380-0-36026";"As we travelled here I saw a ghost, and so now I pray to Tu'whacca to guide the lost soul to final rest."
"165399380-0-36027";"You'd best watch your step around here."
"165399380-0-36028";"I like a warm fire, but I don't care much for strangers."
"165399380-0-36029";"You are not supposed to be here."
"165399380-0-36036";"I could stay here like this all day."
"165399380-0-36037";"This sure beats working."
"165399380-0-36038";"What a beautiful day! I just wish I knew why it smells like wet fur over by the river."
"165399380-0-36040";"What a view!\n\nI had a friend who used to throw cats from a wall like this. Then my friend got caught, so now he just enjoys the view. He won't get caught again!"
"165399380-0-36041";"This stonework is amazing! The use of the arch to provide structure and support … it's ingenious!"
"165399380-0-36044";"I wish I could teach these chickens to clean up after themselves. That would be something to see!"
"165399380-0-36045";"War this and war that! That's all anyone's talking about these days. Well, that and the back-alley murders.\n\nAnd to think, Daggerfall used to be such a safe city."
"165399380-0-36046";"I got here early. It's tough to get a good seat when Pitof's giving the lecture."
"165399380-0-36047";"I could sit here all day. Just listening to Pitof makes my spirit soar!"
"165399380-0-36048";"Do you mind? I'm trying to listen to this."
"165399380-0-36049";"You look like you could use a little inspiration. Have a seat and trust in the gods, my friend."
"165399380-0-36051";"I hope you're here to pray and listen to the words of the faithful, because that's why I'm here."
"165399380-0-36052";"You really should be more respectful. This is a cathedral, not an ale hall."
"165399380-0-36053";"It's so peaceful here. Let's keep it that way."
"165399380-0-36054";"Don't talk to me. Talk to your gods."
"165399380-0-36056";"What a great view! If one of those ships hits the rocks, I'll be able to see everything!"
"165399380-0-36057";"I'm supposed to visit my cousin in Camlorn, but now I'm worried. I heard something about werewolves! Do such creatures really exist?\n\nOh, I don't know what to do!"
"165399380-0-36058";"Good book. Very violent. Lots of action. It's called ""Everybody Dies.""\n\nI wonder how it ends …."
"165399380-0-36061";"Please. Leave me alone. I'm miserable!"
"165399380-0-36062";"I love gardening. It's so relaxing."
"165399380-0-36063";"This is a perfect place to plant flowers."
"165399380-0-36064";"Don't have time to talk, friend. Too much to do!"
"165399380-0-36065";"Daggerfall's always busy this time of year."
"165399380-0-36066";"I swear, it seems like there's always something going on around here, but I never have a clue as to what it is."
"165399380-0-36067";"Well, hello there, stranger. Pull up a chair and sit for a while. I'd love to hear about your adventures."
"165399380-0-36068";"Innkeep said I was too drunk to drink! How rid … how red … how stupid is that?\n\nI do my best drinking when I'm drunk! Ask anyone. Ask Aldimonwe over there. She'll tell you!"
"165399380-0-36069";"The drama of courtly life can't compete with the contents of a good book."
"165399380-0-36070";"You really must go and bother someone else. I'm close to convincing Neomi to come and see my collection of antique riding crops.\n\nIf you know what I mean."
"165399380-0-36071";"Please go away now. I've almost got Michebert to finally ask me over to see his antique riding crops and I don't want anything to get in the way.\n\nI really need to see a good riding crop today."
"165399380-0-36072";"Another one of my shipments has been delayed. They say that there's some kind of trouble at Camlorn and Aldcroft. It's really quite vexing."
"165399380-0-36073";"How did these barrels wind up here? They should have been unloaded with the rest of the cargo.\n\nI say, heads will roll over this!"
"165399380-0-36074";"So much to do. We're always busy this time of year!"
"165399380-0-36076";"Not now, stranger. I'm listening to Pitof's discourse."
"165399380-0-36077";"Fall down on your knees and pray, stranger! Let the words of the Eight fill you with hope and joy."
"165399380-0-36078";"I'm tired of all the long-winded speeches. What we need here is a good riot. That would get my blood boiling!"
"165399380-0-36079";"Such talk is all well and good, but I don't want more bloodshed. We need to find a peaceful solution to this situation."
"165399380-0-36080";"More talk of war. I feel ill."
"165399380-0-36081";"How exciting! The thought of all these brave people gallantly risking their lives for us!\n\nI do believe I'm getting a little flush."
"165399380-0-36082";"I love watching other people work. And you know what would make it even better? A glass of wine and a bowl of grapes to munch on while I'm watching!"
"165399380-0-36083";"I'm ever so thankful that my family is wealthy. I come here everyday to pray for our good fortune."
"165399380-0-36084";"I hate being caught in the middle of this. They just won't listen to reason!\n\nI knew Francine was stubborn, but even Jean is acting like such a dolt. And all because of a little misunderstanding about a dog."
"165399380-0-36085";"I'm not talking to Jean, I'm not listening to Etienne, and I'm not listening to you.\n\nMy cute little puppy is not a menace to society. She's not!"
"165399380-0-36086";"Francine won't listen to me. She's so sensitive about that damn, ugly little dog of hers.\n\nDid she tell you that it bit me? Took a nip out of my ankle. It's a menace—it's a menace, I tell you. A menace!"
"165399380-0-36098";"What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-36112";"I surrender!\n\nWait, you're not one of those mutineer bastards. Please, you have to help me!"
"165399380-0-36134";"Why? Why must she always complain?\n\nSo irritating! I should've never left the army."
"165399380-0-36148";"Can't you see that I'm trying to write? Someone has to document these strange sounds coming from Norvulk Ruins, for posterity!"
"165399380-0-36150";"I appreciate that my brother lets me stay here, but I wish he would at least let me help out.\n\nHe wants me to stay away from the stable, so I'm just supposed to entertain myself here at the house."
"165399380-0-36151";"I know the Murtag clan Orcs are at Shinji's Scarp fighting them, but I can't help feeling nervous when I know there's an army of ogres just over the hill."
"165399380-0-36199";"<The corpse of this pirate is warm to the touch.>"
"165399380-0-36201";"<The Khajiit's dead face is frozen in a rictus of pain.>"
"165399380-0-36203";"Thanks for getting us out of those crypts. From now on I think I'll do my drinking right here in this alley. It's sufficiently draugr-free."
"165399380-0-36204";"Ten cheers for King Jorunn! Ten drinks for Jofarr!"
"165399380-0-36205";"Two minutes. We were only out of the crypts for two minutes before those two drunken idiots ran off. Jofarr's probably been eaten by a troll at this point. To Oblivion with them. It's time they learn self-reliance."
"165399380-0-36206";"<Wounds mark this Bosmer's chest and back, as if it were attacked from all sides.>"
"165399380-0-36232";"Bad archers always depress me."
"165399380-0-36240";"Do I know you? Oh yeah, you're the one who helped us back at the farm.\n\nNow we just need to get back to Camlorn. Guess you can't help us with that."
"165399380-0-36241";"Oh! It's you! My hero! I can't thank you enough for talking me into leaving that house! \n\nWhat was I thinking?"
"165399380-0-36247";"You hold my lock of hair, yet you are not him. Why follow the words of another?\n\nDo you bring me a message from him? Is he delayed?"
"165399380-0-36258";"Marq's special brew is all gone, but the house stuff's not too bad."
"165399380-0-36259";"I miss those Goblins. The food was free, and clothing was optional."
"165399380-0-36272";"You want mead, right? That's all anyone around here wants. How about you dare to be different?"
"165399380-0-36290";"Is… is this really it? Where's the mead? The songs?"
"165399380-0-36292";"Good to see you again, friend. Any luck finding my goods?"
"165399380-0-36294";"Watch yourself traveling these roads alone, stranger."
"165399380-0-36295";"Greetings. I don't suppose you know a man named Kalodar? He's my father.\n\nHe left on a hunting expedition years ago, promising to return in a few months. My mother gave up on him, but I never have."
"165399380-0-36298";"I've already been places, don't you see? From the icy reaches of Skyrim to the salty bays of Black Marsh, I've already seen it. \n\nI just want to stay where I am now."
"165399380-0-36300";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36301";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36302";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36303";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36304";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36305";"I'm glad you're awake. When Holsgar brought you in, everyone thought sure you'd die."
"165399380-0-36337";"If you were wounded in the battle, go see Odette in the infirmary downstairs. She will see that your wounds are treated."
"165399380-0-36341";"I don't ask what's in the boxes. I just fix them."
"165399380-0-36344";"You're not drinking enough! Go buy yourself a mug of something strong.\n\nAnd get one for me while you're over there."
"165399380-0-36363";"Please wait outside. We'll be with you as soon as we can."
"165399380-0-36401";"I just moved here. I'd be more comfortable if I saw more Orcs in this neighborhood.\n\nEverything here is so peaceful. It drives me crazy."
"165399380-0-36424";"They landed so fast. The Redguard were on the docks before anyone knew what was happening."
"165399380-0-36436";"The Fighters Guild won't let me join, just because I don't know how to fight!\n\nIf I can't join, how am I supposed to learn? It's just not fair."
"165399380-0-36481";"Who are you? Get away from me!"
"165399380-0-36483";"Who are you? Get away from me!"
"165399380-0-36488";"Never fear, citizen. She has five more minutes to move that cart or I'll burn it to the ground."
"165399380-0-36489";"I could fix this a lot faster if that Imperial wasn't glaring at me."
"165399380-0-36498";"Just waiting for my ship to come in."
"165399380-0-36507";"I wonder what's out beyond that ocean. Islands? Another continent? Someone else looking back towards me?\n\nMakes you think, doesn't it?"
"165399380-0-36508";"Welcome to the Cloudy Dregs. Don't let the name fool you—you won't find better accommodations in all of Stormhaven."
"165399380-0-36510";"Just leave me to my chickens.\n\nPeople here leave me alone, and that's just the way I like it."
"165399380-0-36522";"The Drublog refuse to tell me anything. After what happened in Velyn Harbor, I can guess why.\n\nYou helped at the harbor. Can I count on you here too?"
"165399380-0-36524";"Collecting a bounty seems like a decent way to make some money. I could pay for some improvements to my house!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not thrilled about the chance that I might die."
"165399380-0-36525";"I know why you're here. You're looking for the reasons we went to Velyn Harbor, right?\n\nI can't say anything. My uncle commands me to be silent. I'm sorry."
"165399380-0-36526";"Drunk? No.\n\nNo no no no no. Not drunk."
"165399380-0-36530";"Your arrogance shall be your undoing, mortal!"
"165399380-0-36531";"Get out, before I beat you senseless."
"165399380-0-36540";"I didn't expect to make it out alive. I don't want to think about what we did to that man."
"165399380-0-36553";"I miss my home.\n\nThis city has too much stone and not enough trees for my taste."
"165399380-0-36554";"Have you seen the guillitone in the marketplace? I think they're going to do something about that Dreamer cult.\n\nI'll be glad when this is all over."
"165399380-0-36556";"Have you seen the guillitone in the marketplace? I think they're going to do something about that Dreamer cult.\n\nI'll be glad when this is all over."
"165399380-0-36564";"Don't tell the guards I'm up here! I just wanted a quick drink.\n\nI'm sorry I made such a terrible mess. Blame the liquor, not me!"
"165399380-0-36565";"Working in a garden is almost as nice as living in the forest.\n\nAt least, that's what I keep telling myself."
"165399380-0-36577";"My father named me after a flower. My mother taught me to tend her garden.\n\nI got sick of it, so I moved out here to be a carpenter. I made the right choice."
"165399380-0-36584";"I told <<1>> someone would come to stop this madness.\n\nAnd here you are, but you're too late."
"165399380-0-36594";"Welcome to the house of the Eight. Enter and may you find whatever it is you seek."
"165399380-0-36598";"Look what the sea spat out, Lambur. Might be just what we need. You interested in some easy money?"
"165399380-0-36599";"If it looks like you need help, I'll kill some Goblins for you."
"165399380-0-36606";"Hurry! The Worms' corruption is eating away at me!"
"165399380-0-36611";"<This farmer was mauled to death by sabre cats. A tattered note is clutched in her hand.>"
"165399380-0-36613";"Hey, you're not a guard. Get me out of here. Please!"
"165399380-0-36614";"I'm tired of chasing that damned Breton."
"165399380-0-36616";"I can't believe it. Trelan and Iriana were finally on their way off this rock!"
"165399380-0-36617";"Cursed Sea Drakes, nothing but mean."
"165399380-0-36619";"Camping here was such a bad idea. But we didn't know."
"165399380-0-36620";"I don't think we'll see Iriana alive again."
"165399380-0-36628";"This one regrets ever coming to Stros."
"165399380-0-36632";"I miss Ebonheart. I wish I was home."
"165399380-0-36657";"I'm a master trader from House Hlaalu! I'm welcome everywhere. But these people want to sacrifice me to some snake!"
"165399380-0-36668";"If you're here to visit, pull up a chair.\n\nIf you're here to cause trouble, talk to the Orc."
"165399380-0-36676";"Don't you be causing any trouble, understand?\n\nBertrand might be friendly and forgiving, but I like to break things."
"165399380-0-36677";"Seeking potions and elixirs? Fortune favors you! I've just finished bottling a new batch. \n\nHave a look."
"165399380-0-36686";"Please, release the bindings."
"165399380-0-36687";"They want to grind my bones into flour. Please, untie me.\n\nMurk-Watcher would like to assure you that any bread made from an Argonian would not taste very good."
"165399380-0-36688";"When my arms are finally free, I'll flail the hide from those Blackmaul thugs with my bare hands."
"165399380-0-36691";"This is the part where I trust you."
"165399380-0-36692";"This is the way things were meant to be. Raerana and I, together forever. Who knows, I might even become a farmer, in time."
"165399380-0-36693";"Thank you, for Rilyn and for my family. \n\nRilyn will keep me safe, forever. For now, I just need to rest."
"165399380-0-36719";"Velyn Harbor is a beautiful city. We'll restore it to its glory, I'm certain of it."
"165399380-0-36723";"I'm not sure if I should welcome you or curse you."
"165399380-0-36727";"I hope we survive this ordeal. I've been at sea so long my children will be grown by the time I return home."
"165399380-0-36734";"The magicka, it fades too quickly! I can't correct for the fluctuations in time. No!\n\nWait … is someone there? Quickly! If you ever want to see the city again, come to me!"
"165399380-0-36753";"You probably don't want to get too close to that village."
"165399380-0-36754";"Pirates? Who said anything about pirates? I certainly didn't. I'm just an honest business woman waiting for her ship to come in.\n\nSo to speak."
"165399380-0-36767";"What you did here was impressive. I hope the rest of Velyn Harbor realizes that.\n\nI also hope they'll welcome an Argonian trader. Not all of us are warriors or fanatics."
"165399380-0-36812";"Why would she want to go in alone? I swear, if the Silvenar finds out about this, I'll never hear the end of it!\n\nSorry, I'm trying to keep an eye on <<c:1>>. Not having much luck, though."
"165399380-0-36813";"I hear the man buried here was brave. I wish I had met him.\n\nThe ice will melt in his honor."
"165399380-0-36814";"Let me catch my breath before the next round, small one."
"165399380-0-36815";"Let me catch my breath before the next round, small one."
"165399380-0-36816";"I don't understand why the Drublog did this. Please, don't judge all Orcs by the actions of a few vicious idiots."
"165399380-0-36821";"This city is far too warm.\n\nI've made some bad choices in my life. Now I'm paying for them … unless I can get someone else to pay for them. Got any coin?"
"165399380-0-36822";"That's right. Look at the freak! Maybe if you pitied me and gave me some coin, you could feel better about yourself!"
"165399380-0-36823";"I don't care about the Covenant's wars. I just need some food and a safe place to sleep."
"165399380-0-36826";"I've spoken to some of the Mabrigash Wisewomen. They've been perfectly polite."
"165399380-0-36830";"This isn't good. I wish my partner Varon was here. He'd know what to do. Wait, no I don't. Varon would wring my neck for being down here.\n\nSo, um, fair warning. This could be bad. Real bad."
"165399380-0-36834";"Sep's vultures! Keep away from me, or I'll ….\n\nOh, my mistake. You're not with the invaders."
"165399380-0-36847";"Welcome to Craftland! I sell racial components.\n""]addmoney 9999999"" to afford your purchases.\n""]tradeskill grantall"" to get the skills you need!\n""]tradeskill list"" to see the tradeskills you have.\n""]tradeskill addinspiration"" to add inspiration."
"165399380-0-36853";"Don't get me wrong. This is a nice place, but it can't compare with Orsinium."
"165399380-0-36855";"I don't care about war. I just want to live my life in peace."
"165399380-0-36859";"That buffoon is still behind me, isn't he? I suppose as long as I don't make any sudden moves, I'll be fine. \n\nI just want to finish my ale in peace."
"165399380-0-36860";"I shouldn't talk with my mouth full, but I can't stop eating!\n\nThis bread is wonderful! Warm and chewy and … oh … so, so good!"
"165399380-0-36862";"Have you seen the guillitone in the marketplace? I think they're going to do something about that Dreamer cult.\n\nI'll be glad when this is all over."
"165399380-0-36865";"Oh, we're not set up here to sell produce right now. Emilien's fault, wherever he is."
"165399380-0-36871";"Nothing to see here! This one just forgot her key.\n\nYamaea is a servant in this house, but now she can't get back inside. She sincerely hopes she has not done anything to offend her generous employer."
"165399380-0-36878";"If you want to buy something, speak to my brother."
"165399380-0-36905";"If your pockets are getting too full, I'm the man you need to talk to."
"165399380-0-36916";"Speak to the captain. She's the one who likes to talk."
"165399380-0-36929";"We'll hold the Fighters Guild as long as we can."
"165399380-0-36933";"What brings you to this trashpit?"
"165399380-0-36936";"What brings you to this trashpit?"
"165399380-0-36937";"Just because I'm Altmer doesn't mean I support the Aldmeri Dominion.\n\nI walked away from conquest and war a long time ago. Life is too short, even for me."
"165399380-0-36938";"Some days, I feel like we've got too many cooks in this kitchen. It's not easy being Leobois' apprentice."
"165399380-0-36939";"We didn't mean to cause any trouble. How could love between two people cause so much suffering?"
"165399380-0-36941";"I came to see if the king of this land needed soldiers, but xuth! These Bretons are most unfriendly to outsiders. \n\nNow I just sit and drink and wait for work to come my way."
"165399380-0-36943";"If you possess sufficient power, I have the knowledge you seek."
"165399380-0-36969";"You're a welcome sight. I've rescued everyone but Crenard, <<1>>, and Mekag. Any luck?"
"165399380-0-36971";"Headman Bhosek threw my sweet Jakarn into the Grave!"
"165399380-0-36973";"You are wanting to forge metal, yes? Akethi has what you need."
"165399380-0-36974";"Fashion—bah! My garments don't turn heads, but it's better to be frumpy and warm than stylish and dead, eh?"
"165399380-0-36975";"Greetings, I have everything a young alchemist can want."
"165399380-0-36976";"Greetings, what can I help you with?"
"165399380-0-36977";"Greetings. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-36979";"Greetings, how can I serve you?"
"165399380-0-36981";"<Captain Helane doesn't seem to see you.>"
"165399380-0-36985";"I shouldn't have stood up. Look how swollen that ankle is."
"165399380-0-36986";"My, that felt good!"
"165399380-0-36988";"Thanks for breaking me out back there.\n\nListen, while you're in a heroic mood, want to help me get something I left with the Goblins?"
"165399380-0-37009";"I thought we were all dead. You and the captain got us out, but it was damn close."
"165399380-0-37010";"Helane may be a murderous witch, but she does have good taste in books.\n\nDon't bother looking for One-Legged Elvinn. I already set him free."
"165399380-0-37012";"Sit down, warm your bones.\n\nSee the two dead pirates? They killed Lazy Gwael. I liked him. Only pirate I ever knew who liked rats.\n\nNow, the pirates who killed him are rat food. Seems fitting, doesn't it?"
"165399380-0-37016";"Fair warning—don't drink the rum in the desk below. I'd guess someone poisoned it.\n\nThis is a nice bed."
"165399380-0-37017";"If you're looking for that bastard Jakarn, he's at the tavern with a Redguard girl."
"165399380-0-37018";"Hey there, glad to see you made it out."
"165399380-0-37058";"Stop right there! No one enters, Chief Tazgol's orders."
"165399380-0-37059";"Greetings, stranger. You are not a cultist. Help us defeat these necromancers!"
"165399380-0-37071";"The wards. They're active! That's impossible.\n\nNo one outside my … organization … should have been able to activate them. If the Maulborn are using this base, the entire city is in danger!"
"165399380-0-37080";"Soon we will fade from this plane once more. We have you to thank for returning us to peace."
"165399380-0-37117";"I know you. You were in the sewers, right?\n\nYou saved me, didn't you. I don't remember much, but I remember you."
"165399380-0-37118";"Hear a lot of noise going on up there? Anything I need to be concerned about?"
"165399380-0-37127";"Just leave me alone, would you?"
"165399380-0-37128";"Tedras must be strong if he hopes to get through his teachings. Let us hope they do not send him on many boats."
"165399380-0-37129";"Well, we were on our way to get registered and start these classes, but well, you can see a certain someone here doesn't handle the sea very well."
"165399380-0-37170";"How much longer must I wait? I need this loan!"
"165399380-0-37183";"I knew Ela would find someone to help us. But even with our lives saved, what about our livelihood?"
"165399380-0-37185";"If only I could see <<1>> one more time. But the Ra Gada monsters probably skinned and ate him by now."
"165399380-0-37220";"This one is not going to run away. This one likes working here.\n\nThis dog, however, does not believe me."
"165399380-0-37229";"We used to stop here every other season. I doubt we'll be coming here again, after all this.\n\nI'm done being sentimental. I just want to get everyone out, alive and mostly unharmed."
"165399380-0-37249";"I can almost see Bangkorai from here.\n\nI knew I would have to leave home when I married into a Breton family, but now, I don't think I can ever go back."
"165399380-0-37266";"I have a job. I don't live in a swamp. People here don't try to kill me.\n\nThe way I figure it, I'm better off than most Argonians."
"165399380-0-37268";"I miss the ocean.\n\nI left home so I could go on an epic journey, but I don't think I've reached my destination yet."
"165399380-0-37290";"You've inspired a number of Velyn Harbor's citizens to join the militia. You rescued them, now they'll protect the town when you're gone.\n\nThank you!"
"165399380-0-37310";"You can always tell which potions are the most potent—they taste the worst. So let me tell you, friend, I sell the worst tasting potions in all of Glenumbra."
"165399380-0-37325";"A good meal isn't complete without the perfect brew … or beer … or cider.\n\nYou get the idea."
"165399380-0-37352";"We're ready to settle down finally. But not here. Anywhere but here, I hope."
"165399380-0-37378";"Chief Tazgol is leading an attack on Carzog's Demise!"
"165399380-0-37387";"I unlocked the door. Now we can retrieve my gem.\n\nI'll see you inside."
"165399380-0-37391";"Whatever it is, I didn't do it."
"165399380-0-37397";"These ruins don't interest me, but the pay does. \n\nI'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be searching for. I just try to look busy."
"165399380-0-37444";"I'm not going to just hand you my best gear, soldier. You better damn well earn it."
"165399380-0-37445";"If you're the best of the best, I'll give you some of the best gear we've got.\n\nIf you're another half-wit recruit looking for a quick advantage over our enemies, you're wasting my time, soldier."
"165399380-0-37446";"Seems like our war with the Dominion and the Pact never ends.\n\nThat's why it's a good idea to never let up on your training."
"165399380-0-37447";"What can I say? I got tired of swinging a sword.\n\nWhen you want to do the job right, drop a giant rock on someone. I have what you need to launch really big rocks."
"165399380-0-37452";"Thank you for settling the Mammoths. I don't know what we would've done without you."
"165399380-0-37453";"<<1>> tells us you're quite the hero! Well done!"
"165399380-0-37454";"<<1>> tells us you're quite the hero! Well done!"
"165399380-0-37455";"Those Daedra took off with their tails between their legs! Well, the ones with tails, anyway."
"165399380-0-37491";"I knew I'd find you here! \n\nWe're still raising funds for our next voyage, but it's only a matter of time. If you ever decide you want to set out to sea, let me know! We could use a heroic crewman like you!"
"165399380-0-37492";"Quite the motley crew, aren't we?"
"165399380-0-37494";"It's a wonderful day for a sailing trip, isn't it, friend? Especially if it gets me off this rock before Bhosek chops off my head."
"165399380-0-37495";"I remember you! You tricked me to get into that library. You said my wife was seeing someone else! I had to leave Wayrest to get away from that lying, deceitful, treacherous ….\n\nExcuse me. I've got a great job in Wayrest now. Thank you!"
"165399380-0-37497";"My life is better here in Wayrest. I have you to thank for that.\n\nI'm also grateful that this tavern isn't troubled by crocodiles. That's a nice change of pace."
"165399380-0-37519";"Hey! The captain's looking for you."
"165399380-0-37522";"The Dwemer were wonderful machinists. We could learn much from studying their works."
"165399380-0-37525";"If the others were unharmed, maybe there is hope for my sweet <<1>>!"
"165399380-0-37526";"I don't know why we're still here. <<1>>'s the boss, so we wait on her orders.\n\nI could use a strong drink right about now."
"165399380-0-37528";"That was amazing! I'll need to get myself some of that oil now.\n\nUh, but don't mention that to <<1>>."
"165399380-0-37534";"I trust you are here to help. Dark rituals are being performed around the island. \n\nI first smelled the corruption on the wind. Then my shaman found evidence at an Ayleid ruin nearby."
"165399380-0-37535";"Summoning spirits can be dangerous work. I heard about you. About how you entered the ruins of Baelborne tower.\n\nYou must not undo the sacrifices that have already been made. My master sent me to give you advice and guide you to the right decision."
"165399380-0-37541";"Nyah, go away! Supper's not for another hour, at least!"
"165399380-0-37543";"It's such an honor to work here! <<1>>'s rotmeth is legendary. His family's made it for generations. I wonder if I'll ever be trusted with their secrets!"
"165399380-0-37544";"I'd still be in <<1>> if those blasted Houndsmen hadn't stirred up trouble.\n\nMaybe <<2>> will come to his senses soon."
"165399380-0-37546";"Isn't <<1>> a marvel? He's from Summerset! The songs he plays are from all over!"
"165399380-0-37563";"What is this place? What happened to the tower? What … what have you done?\n\nThe Baelbornes hired you, didn't they? But you don't understand. You don't know what I gave up to stop them. I lost everything! I lost my … my baby."
"165399380-0-37564";"Please hurry! If nobody stops them they'll eat everything, even the trees!"
"165399380-0-37565";"There's something not right here. The forest, the beasts … everything's wary. Watching."
"165399380-0-37572";"What … what's going on? Where am I?\n\nWait, I know you. I feel like we just talked but … I can't remember anything."
"165399380-0-37578";"I walked in here and this young man nearly fell on my head!\n\nAnd you? Were you successful?"
"165399380-0-37592";"Have you ever been in love—madly, desperately, stupidly in love? If so, you know how I feel. Madria and I were meant to be together.\n\nIf only I weren't so hateful in her father's eyes."
"165399380-0-37600";"You'd better not be here to talk about Remius. I hear enough of him from my daughter, who needs to learn obedience. Remius - bah! He'll never have Madria."
"165399380-0-37601";"You… you look familar. Have we met? My memory is hazy, I took ill on a recent trip to Deshaan."
"165399380-0-37602";"Father doesn't understand. Remius and I love each other. We must be together!"
"165399380-0-37607";"The work around here never ends. I'm just resting for a bit."
"165399380-0-37612";"Shoveling mud! I suppose it's better than getting my skull bashed in by a Goblin or being eaten alive by a zombie. And I'm getting paid for it, so it could be worse."
"165399380-0-37613";"I hope Amadour comes up with new pumpkin recipes soon. I'm sick of eating fried pumpkin every day."
"165399380-0-37624";"No time for idle chatter. I'm testing a new way of growing corn. I flood the field, keeping the plants wet all the time. I just have to figure out why half my crop keeps dying."
"165399380-0-37642";"If I catch that pervert Shagol staring at my backside one more time, he'll get this shovel between the eyes. That should teach him."
"165399380-0-37660";"Joy to you. Have you ever seen a pleasanter place? Dirt upon one's hands, life growing, the smell of manure on the breeze. No more the soldier's fate for me."
"165399380-0-37661";"Quickly … you've defeated the guardian, but it will return soon. You need to get inside the city and locate the three spinners."
"165399380-0-37662";"Every night, I pray to Arkay to kill me in my sleep. Every morning, I wake up, still here. I hate this place. There's nothing to do, everything's always dirty, and I'm dressed in rags. Someday I'm going to beat Octavimus to death with this broom."
"165399380-0-37668";"Cropsford's not much, but it's good enough for me. Start a family, grow crops, grow old, and pass it along to your children. Who needs anything more?"
"165399380-0-37693";"At times it is a hard decision: grow crops or wallow in the waters."
"165399380-0-37695";"I've been praying to Z'en for the Drublog to stand down. None of us would survive against their mad rage."
"165399380-0-37696";"We haven't had a good night's sleep ever since the Drublog arrived.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give for them to up and leave."
"165399380-0-37697";"The Drublog should be ashamed of what they're doing to this valley. They destroy the Green without a care."
"165399380-0-37699";"I've heard rumors that <<1>> has been seeing the Drublog chief's son.\n\nA fool's folly. She's too good for that lout."
"165399380-0-37700";"We can't go that way."
"165399380-0-37703";"I hope my lackwit twin isn't bothering you. Ever since the accident… Well, just look at him."
"165399380-0-37712";"Do you know why we're building more walls? I sure don't.\n\nNo one tells me anything, but I think there's something odd going on."
"165399380-0-37718";"I thought we would be pulling up stakes by now, but the general wants more walls.\n\nI don't ask. I just do."
"165399380-0-37719";"I thought we would be moving on by now, but the general wants us to put up more walls.\n\nThat means I don't have much time to talk to wanderers. Excuse me."
"165399380-0-37720";"Everyone around here is on edge. I mean, it's a dangerous place, but I think they're ready to move on."
"165399380-0-37722";"I don't have any food to spare, but I can certainly sell you some brew."
"165399380-0-37728";"Hey there. Interested in one of my girls? They're the finest mares on the Isle."
"165399380-0-37731";"Hungry?"
"165399380-0-37732";"Did my sisters send you to aid us?"
"165399380-0-37735";"My darling daughter. No. She … she can't be dead. No, no, no."
"165399380-0-37736";"Have my sister's sent you to aid us?"
"165399380-0-37737";"New to <<1>>? Walk softly around the Bloody Fists."
"165399380-0-37740";"Thirsty, traveler?"
"165399380-0-37751";"Don't know why I bother. The fools sink these boats as fast as I fix 'em."
"165399380-0-37752";"Kaleen's never getting off this island. No one's gonna sail with her ever again."
"165399380-0-37753";"The Spearhead's no Maiden's Breath, but at least she doesn't have a giant hole in her side.\n\nI'd be happy if we never saw land again."
"165399380-0-37754";"Stros M'Kai is a depressing place. Too many Redguards waving their damn swords around. At least on the Spearhead, no one wants to kill me except Irien.\n\nShe'll come around. She's crazy about me."
"165399380-0-37755";"What do you want?"
"165399380-0-37758";"I'm looking forward to seeing Jakarn in action. I hear he's an incredible sailor. Lots of … stamina."
"165399380-0-37759";"Blade's edge, we're setting sail with the famous Jakarn!\n\nElethien and I have a bet on who's going to bed him first."
"165399380-0-37760";"I'd give my sword arm for him!"
"165399380-0-37761";"I can't wait to see Jakarn's battle scars. I'm sure he's got them everywhere."
"165399380-0-37762";"Wherever Captain Lerisa goes, I go. Even on this tub. Can't wait until we get our own ship again."
"165399380-0-37764";"Ah! Don't sneak up on me."
"165399380-0-37766";"<This body has multiple stab wounds and several blunt impact wounds. It's been stripped of anything valuable.>"
"165399380-0-37767";"I can't hold a sword yet, but I can hold a book. Perhaps I should find a book that will teach me to fight with my left hand!"
"165399380-0-37768";"Really, how do they eat this stuff? I'm going to teach Fenlil a thing or two about cooking."
"165399380-0-37769";"<This body had its head bashed in. There are no valuables.>"
"165399380-0-37770";"The Spearhead's a good ship but she's no Maiden's Breath. At least she'll get us away from Stros M'Kai.\n\nLooking forward to getting to know Lambur better. I like an Orc with a quick blade and a quicker tongue."
"165399380-0-37771";"When active, Dwemer spiders have an extraordinary capacity for learning.\n\nNow I have to stop Andrilion from teaching Clanker to bring him drinks."
"165399380-0-37774";"Wonderful. Now I've been ordered to follow Neramo on another fool's errand. At least the drinks are free."
"165399380-0-37775";"To be on the seas once again. This is paradise.\n\nHeadman Bhosek is a cruel master. If Kaleen will have me, I will join the Spearhead's crew."
"165399380-0-37776";"This should be an interesting voyage. Quite a crew Kaleen has thrown together!"
"165399380-0-37777";"Captain Kaleen took her time getting off this damned island. Doesn't surprise me. Orc problems aren't her problems.\n\nBut we'd be stuck here if not for your help. I won't forget that."
"165399380-0-37782";"I think I'm on the verge of a breakthrough. Stand back! This could be messy."
"165399380-0-37785";"I don't want to die out here! You've got to help me!"
"165399380-0-37789";"The bounty of the sea nourishes my family. Early word of approaching ships brings coin from Headman Bhosek as well."
"165399380-0-37791";"I thought I was the last one left out here. Well, get up here and fight beside me. Today is a glorious day to die!"
"165399380-0-37842";"The witches use magic the likes of which I've never seen before. I don't entirely trust it, but it does seem to be working."
"165399380-0-37843";"Kyla … my poor Kyla …."
"165399380-0-37844";"She needs time. Her daughter died right in front of us. The imps just kept tossing bolts of fire. They wouldn't stop. It took everything I had just to keep the flames at bay.\n\nSomething evil corrupts the forest spirits. It must be stopped!"
"165399380-0-37845";"In <<1>>, the wise look for protection against the blades of the Bloody Fists."
"165399380-0-37847";"I still can't believe this is happening. The forest has never turned on us before.\n\nAnd there are so few of us now. I hate to say it, but this might really be the end of Deleyn's Mill."
"165399380-0-37850";"Peace to you, wayfarer, but I have naught to sell. Speak with my mother below."
"165399380-0-37863";"How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-37865";"Some gather firewood only when they see snow fall. The spring sun will thaw their corpses."
"165399380-0-37867";"I don't have time for idle chatter. This wheel won't fix itself."
"165399380-0-37876";"Larus is stubborn as an ox. Maybe it comes from hauling this cart around all day."
"165399380-0-37877";"Need a weapon? These Redguards love swords, but I sell all varieties."
"165399380-0-37879";"My poor Jakarn! I don't want to think about what they're doing to him down there. He's a Prince! He doesn't belong in the Grave."
"165399380-0-37880";"<<<1>> died recently, blood still oozing from his wounds.>"
"165399380-0-37882";"Shhh. Don't tell Ufgra you saw me here. She's always finding something for me to do."
"165399380-0-37887";"A fortunate tide brings you to my stall, traveler."
"165399380-0-37890";"Khajiit make me nervous. We must be desperate to be hiring all these conscripts."
"165399380-0-37891";"My darling son's gone off on some fool errand. I hope he returns in one piece."
"165399380-0-37892";"We weren't supposed to be here so long. The general's waiting for something, but I don't know what it is. Reinforcements, maybe?\n\nI don't care about his reasons. I care for the wounded."
"165399380-0-37896";"Selling supplies to these grunts is child's play! I don't think the moron commanding them was ready for this mess.\n\nOf course, it is also my distinct pleasure to sell to discriminating travelers such as yourself."
"165399380-0-37899";"You'll have to come back later I'm afraid. My master is out on a grand adventure at the moment."
"165399380-0-37911";"The melodies ease my mind. I like being around all these musicians."
"165399380-0-37914";"Excuse, please. This one must entertain the guests."
"165399380-0-37915";"Shove off. Can't get into their coinpurses with you standing around."
"165399380-0-37916";"Excuse me. A hundred guests to feed before evening. Lots to do and only ten fingers to do it with."
"165399380-0-37917";"Yeah, yeah, welcome to Skywatch. I've got work to do."
"165399380-0-37918";"The quarry faces the hunter at last. You won't stop me from claiming my prize!"
"165399380-0-37920";"What can this one get you?"
"165399380-0-37930";"Zally admits, she likes to keep the upstairs clean. Warmer up here, and fewer drunken hands to squeeze her tail."
"165399380-0-37931";"Nice to get some warmth into these old bones. The mistress is kind to give us time to rest."
"165399380-0-37932";"Come, sit by the fire. Nice and warm."
"165399380-0-37936";"They keep asking me if I have trouble getting things off the top shelf. Geniuses."
"165399380-0-37937";"No, we don't know any of the ""Lusty Argonian Ballads."" Sit."
"165399380-0-37938";"Don't worry. The beer's better than the music. What can Mic get you?"
"165399380-0-37945";"My father met my mother in a tomb not far from here. He said when their eyes first met, he was struck dumb. She cut him down from the spider nest, and they're together ever since.\n\nPerhaps I'll meet a lass the same way. Keep up the family tradition!"
"165399380-0-37954";"Yeah? What'll it be?"
"165399380-0-37955";"You look tired. The best beds in all of <<1>> are right upstairs!"
"165399380-0-37957";"Kaleen's still hiding behind Lambur, eh? If I catch her alone, I'll suck her eyeballs out."
"165399380-0-37958";"Go 'way. We're drinking here."
"165399380-0-37960";"Hmm? Don't want any. Stop bothering me."
"165399380-0-37962";"Don't bother Grubulash. She's obsessed when researching."
"165399380-0-37964";"<A slit throat marks the end of this Breton's adventures in the exciting city of <<1>>. The backpack next to the body has been emptied.>"
"165399380-0-37965";"Nothing like a good book, is there? And this is nothing like one, I'm afraid."
"165399380-0-37978";"So far, Cropsford hasn't been ravaged by this war. Some say we've been lucky. I say we've been blessed by Zenithar."
"165399380-0-37991";"No man can resist my charms. It's good to know I've still got it!"
"165399380-0-37996";"The only good Goblin is a dead Goblin. With its head cut off."
"165399380-0-38000";"Elves …."
"165399380-0-38011";"<The monkey seems agitated and keeps looking eagerly toward the coastline.>"
"165399380-0-38043";"Leave me to my drink, stranger. If I can't remember what matters, might as well forget it all."
"165399380-0-38047";"Cropsford may seem peaceful, but trouble is everywhere."
"165399380-0-38057";"Who's there? <<1>>? \n\nNo, you're someone else. Please, don't kill me. I've nothing of value to steal."
"165399380-0-38059";"No matter where I travel, my bargains are all the same!"
"165399380-0-38066";"I'm in the mood for skewered Goblin. You with me?"
"165399380-0-38067";"You'd have to walk awfully far to find bargains like mine … farther than I do!"
"165399380-0-38068";"By the thousand scales of Satakal! What savings!"
"165399380-0-38073";"The prisoner must pay for his crimes. It is the only way to restore order to the kingdom."
"165399380-0-38075";"My customers all say the same thing: Mahbub knows quality. Mahbub knows bargains."
"165399380-0-38084";"If you've got extra junk you want to get rid of, I'll give a decent price for it.\n\nIf you're looking to buy, my prices won't break you. I'm not that kind of merchant."
"165399380-0-38093";"We weren't prepared for the Aldmeri Dominion to assault Farwatch Tower. Now we're scrambling to keep them contained."
"165399380-0-38116";"Blasted elves! How dare they attack Farwatch!\n\nWe're not prepared for this. If they launch a full assault, we're doomed."
"165399380-0-38121";"<The monkey looks at you hopefully.>"
"165399380-0-38126";"Death is but another moment in time. Quickly, continue your mission or my sacrifice will be worthless."
"165399380-0-38129";"Death came before all but life. It will come again to us all. I shall linger, though, to see your mission conclude."
"165399380-0-38132";"The future is always uncertain. You did what was necessary. Continue, and you may yet save Silvenar."
"165399380-0-38133";"Hey. Get you something? A room, maybe a drink?"
"165399380-0-38159";"Glad to see you made it out."
"165399380-0-38163";"Glad to see you made it out."
"165399380-0-38167";"Glad to see you made it out."
"165399380-0-38172";"I'm standing here trying to figure out how much this stop is going to cost us. The Queen's time is valuable, you know. \n\nKeeping up with noble fashions alone sets us back several gold a day."
"165399380-0-38173";"Just jotting this stop down for posterity. Ahem. ""The Queen was a stickler for tradition, and would not eschew the dead.""\n\nNo, that doesn't sound good at all."
"165399380-0-38174";"Damn this delay. Her majesty is too good for this pomp and circumstance.\n\nWe should be out with the people, not wasting our time with the dead."
"165399380-0-38175";"The countryside is beautiful, is it not? Just wish my lovely wife were here to enjoy it with me."
"165399380-0-38176";"<Qawi squeaks happily. He seems very fond of you.>"
"165399380-0-38181";"Are you with the Thalmor? Thank Y'ffre, I knew they'd send help!\n\nThey wiped our camp out. When the patrol disappeared, I thought … wait, where are the rest of you?"
"165399380-0-38182";"Stay wary, traveler. Unnatural creatures stalk these woods.\n\nWe paid the price for our ignorance. Learn from our mistakes."
"165399380-0-38201";"My wife will never know what happened to me."
"165399380-0-38208";"Just being back on a ship brings more memories. I'm looking forward to the voyage."
"165399380-0-38211";"Run while you still can! There's no telling when they'll strike again!"
"165399380-0-38214";"Damn that Kaleen. Won't sail with her again, no money in it."
"165399380-0-38215";"A Breton fighting for the Direnni? Somewhat surprising though not unheard of considering the current circumstances.\n\nWait a moment. That armor …. I've heard stories about you. They say you fight as if Auri-El himself blessed you."
"165399380-0-38219";"I pray that blessed Tava sends a ship soon. Never again shall I sail on the Spearhead."
"165399380-0-38220";"Ask anyone. If you want the best, you need to make it yourself."
"165399380-0-38221";"How can I help you, friend?"
"165399380-0-38222";"<The captain doesn't seem to notice you. He's staring intently at something behind you.>"
"165399380-0-38223";"I bring fine powders, tinctures, and concoctions from far away lands."
"165399380-0-38241";"Favorable winds no longer fill Captain Kaleen's sails. I fear she is landbound forever."
"165399380-0-38244";"Wanna drink? Better than the stuff the tavern serves!"
"165399380-0-38249";"Know, O wayfarer, that Bloody Bhosek will soon be no more. Await the sign and strike with us!"
"165399380-0-38252";"Soon, the fates shall descend on Headman Bhosek and he shall be no more!"
"165399380-0-38253";"Shh! Don't give me away. Soon as I get a chance, I'm climbing those vines and robbing this place."
"165399380-0-38256";"Hoping to see Bhosek? So am I, for three days now!"
"165399380-0-38257";"I'm sorry, but I don't really feel like talking. I've been trying to find a quiet minute all day. \n\nI need to pray for my son. He's missing, you see."
"165399380-0-38258";"The gods have abandoned Stros M'Kai. All live only at the whim of Headman Bhosek."
"165399380-0-38261";"Don't irritate him, please. He can be quite cruel."
"165399380-0-38265";"My daughters! They spend all day working in that inn.\n\nI'm so proud of their success, but now they're all grown up! This house is so big and empty when they're away."
"165399380-0-38267";"I don't see ""Meet Disreputable Stranger"" on the headman's agenda, so you'll need to wait for another day."
"165399380-0-38268";"Don't touch anything! Everything's in its proper place; I don't want anything moved."
"165399380-0-38269";"The waters of justice flow around this cursed town, avoiding all in it."
"165399380-0-38270";"Isn't he done talking yet? I've been waiting forever!"
"165399380-0-38271";"I hate this place, don't you? But I can't drag Gurilda away from her books until she's read every last cursed one."
"165399380-0-38272";"This place would be nice, if Bhosek weren't around."
"165399380-0-38279";"Surprised to see me? So were the Sea Elves. I didn't even have time to say ""Mages Guild!"" before they killed me. \n\nAnd now, here sits poor old Beddi. Stuck because of that stupid bet."
"165399380-0-38280";"I'm waiting for someone … someone who isn't you.\n\nI think it would be best for you to leave now."
"165399380-0-38287";"Stars above, more interruptions. Is this important? I'm monitoring a very delicate experiment right now."
"165399380-0-38303";"You haven't seen a sneaky little Goblin around here, have you? I'm gonna kill that thing, no matter what Amadour says."
"165399380-0-38310";"On behalf of the Knights of the Flame, I came here to pay my respects.\n\nYou saved my order and now my king, friend. I have a feeling I will hear about many more of your accomplishments in the future. I'm honored to know you."
"165399380-0-38311";"You remind me of my old self. Proud, and full of hope."
"165399380-0-38312";"In all the years I've known him, I've never seen Godrun so emotional. \n\nI'm sure the king will forgive him, but I worry that he will not be able to forgive himself."
"165399380-0-38314";"<This man was killed by wild beasts.>"
"165399380-0-38315";"<This man is dead. Beetles have been gnawing on the corpse.>"
"165399380-0-38316";"<This woman was killed by wild beasts.>"
"165399380-0-38317";"<This woman looks to have drowned.>"
"165399380-0-38318";"The souls of the dead are restless. Ancient warriors who died in battle against the Bretons now rise. Who calls to them, and why?"
"165399380-0-38320";"The hills and valleys of this land are so beautiful. Even the light is different here than in my homeland."
"165399380-0-38328";"Ho, there! You're who I think you are, aren't you?"
"165399380-0-38329";"<This Scamp is not obviously aggressive. Around its neck is a choker bearing an inscription.>"
"165399380-0-38331";"The souls of the dead are restless. Ancient warriors who died in battle against the Bretons now rise. Who calls to them, and why?"
"165399380-0-38332";"Hello there! Are you enjoying the festival?"
"165399380-0-38337";"You return, new scent? To free the one who is trapped?"
"165399380-0-38341";"I'm drafting a report for command. I hope you don't mind accolades.\n\nIf it was up to me, you'd get the biggest damned medal they'd make!"
"165399380-0-38345";"Where am I? The attack … the lieutenant was injured. I pulled him into a bush to hide. \n\nAfter that … voices, dead ones! I struck at them … the lieutenant! He isn't …?"
"165399380-0-38356";"Who are you? Why does Lyris walk with you?"
"165399380-0-38364";"I've supplies for the seasoned traveler, and those who're just starting out. Please take a look."
"165399380-0-38365";"Pass … friend."
"165399380-0-38366";"You bring sunlight in your wake. Welcome and be blessed."
"165399380-0-38371";"Ah! The savior of Silvenar. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-38372";"Who's there? I thought I said I wasn't to be disturbed!"
"165399380-0-38375";"Shandi is a funny one! I hope she stays for the next feast."
"165399380-0-38387";"Time I spend talking to you is time away from my patients."
"165399380-0-38396";"Trouble follows like hyenas after the wounded. I wish they were dealt with as easily."
"165399380-0-38401";"Just when things were settling down, the Khajiit make a mess."
"165399380-0-38402";"So many tomes. So little time."
"165399380-0-38403";"Did you hear what happened to the Mane? Disaster comes for us all eventually, but a Daedra? Unthinkable!"
"165399380-0-38405";"Welcome to my home. Do you like it?\n\nGreat. Thanks for stopping by. Now leave, before I throw you out."
"165399380-0-38406";"And so we meet again. Tabakah and I were actually just on our way back to the Abbey.\n\nWe heard Abbot Durak was here so we came to tell him that the shrine was cleansed. I guess you beat us to it, though."
"165399380-0-38407";"Ah! <<1>> did not hear you approach! Too busy … helping the shopkeeper, ah … organize her wares! So organized now!\n\nAnd, um … <<2>> is nice this time of year, yes?"
"165399380-0-38408";"Oh! It's you. I can't believe it! \n\nI was just praying for Azura to watch over the king, and you show up at that very moment? This can't be a coincidence."
"165399380-0-38412";"Queen Ayrenn decided a warrior would be her best ambassador to Silvenar. I agree."
"165399380-0-38414";"You know, I was thinking. If Vaermina's Omens were really driving people mad, does that mean they weren't responsible for their decisions?\n\nNever mind—don't answer that."
"165399380-0-38416";"Ah … good to see you again, my friend. Your fame is growing fast. \n\nI hear your name all the time now. Better you take the spotlight, and I can stick to the shadows, eh?"
"165399380-0-38417";"It's you! You … you are amazing!"
"165399380-0-38418";"The Silvenar is saved, thanks to you! Our city will sing your name for years to come!"
"165399380-0-38419";"You set those Houndsmen running with their tails between their legs! Get it? Tails? You know, because they're … Houndsmen!\n\nHave a drink … it'll sound funnier then!"
"165399380-0-38441";"The spirits of the tree told me to follow you. They spoke of great suffering in Aldcroft.\n\nI'm here to aid in any way that I can."
"165399380-0-38442";"Hello again. We decided that a few of us should come to help the refugees here."
"165399380-0-38454";"Hail, friend! I was ordered to bring news of our victory at Camlorn to the main camp here in Aldcroft."
"165399380-0-38455";"No, I'm not gonna do your laundry too. Bug off."
"165399380-0-38457";"Thank goodness for the Sea Drakes. They may be bad people but the wrecks they cause are great!"
"165399380-0-38460";"You … you are not one of them. You have not the taint. Help us. Free us from this torment!"
"165399380-0-38463";"Piss off. Find your own junk pile."
"165399380-0-38465";"There you are, Vestige. We must speak at once."
"165399380-0-38475";"Any word of ships approaching?"
"165399380-0-38477";"Hark at Kaleen, acting like she owns the town. I wish her a bitter fate!"
"165399380-0-38481";"The pain is bad enough. The surprise and betrayal, worse."
"165399380-0-38485";"One definitely tires of seeing one's own blood."
"165399380-0-38503";"Don't tell the others, but maybe going back to Kaleen would be better than sitting around here."
"165399380-0-38510";"Things are settling down, now the town is free of the Red Rooks. \n\nI confess, it was a bit exciting, being part of the resistance."
"165399380-0-38517";"I was thinking I might join the Fighters Guild.  See the world, have some adventures."
"165399380-0-38533";"Thank you for what you have done."
"165399380-0-38534";"I wanted to say thank you again."
"165399380-0-38535";"Congratulations. You are a true hero."
"165399380-0-38536";"Is this not peaceful? I seek refuge here when the cruelty of Bhosek and his minions overwhelms me."
"165399380-0-38541";"Um, hello. That was a bit of a predicament. The Remly brothers do set a good trap, I must say. That one trussed me up tight.\n\nBut now that you're here … wait a moment. Who are you?"
"165399380-0-38552";"Raw seaweed. That's the secret. I could eat it for hours on end."
"165399380-0-38561";"Just keeping my fingers warm, friend. I'll be playing in the tavern later tonight."
"165399380-0-38568";"Careful. Bhosek's Fists watch strangers closely. Step out of line and you'll get beaten."
"165399380-0-38570";"You have freed me! But my warriors still cry out for an end to their torment."
"165399380-0-38573";"Exquisite, isn't it?"
"165399380-0-38580";"You're not a Supernal Dreamer. Who are you?"
"165399380-0-38582";"Have you seen the guillotine in the marketplace? I think they're going to do something about that Dreamer cult.\n\nI'll be glad when this is all over."
"165399380-0-38585";"This waiting's killing me. I gotta get to sea again soon."
"165399380-0-38593";"I didn't realize the harpies would be in so much agony. They hate being trapped like that.\n\nI'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this."
"165399380-0-38594";"Something's not right. Gelvin hasn't returned yet and Lord Diel's getting more and more impatient.\n\nBy Azura, he doesn't look like he intends to do much research, either. I think he likes to watch those creatures suffer."
"165399380-0-38596";"Ah, you're back. Much more reliable than those damn Daggers. I don't see their leader, Gelvin. He didn't come back with you? More gold for the rest of you, I suppose.\n\nNow, hand over the eggs, please."
"165399380-0-38597";"Greedy, ignorant, ugly, son of a mammoth's ass! That Diel can go leap in the river."
"165399380-0-38608";"Enjoying <<1>>? It's a fine place, until you get your throat slit."
"165399380-0-38611";"Welcome! What will you have?"
"165399380-0-38614";"Something fishy's going on here. I think Lord Diel hasn't been entirely truthful with us.\n\nBut how did you find me? Granette sent you, didn't she?"
"165399380-0-38615";"Ready to fight for the Dominion?"
"165399380-0-38616";"Hope I can help you find something magical."
"165399380-0-38617";"How can this one serve you?"
"165399380-0-38620";"Learn from your experiences."
"165399380-0-38621";"Knowledge is power. Power is power. Learn to wield both."
"165399380-0-38622";"<<1>> will need your help dealing with these muskarse invaders. You're up to the task, yes?"
"165399380-0-38638";"I didn't want to do it, but it had to be done. \n\nI just hope he forgets all this when he gets back to his right mind … if he gets back to his right mind, I suppose."
"165399380-0-38639";"We'll work through the night if we have to. We're putting out to sea as soon as possible. This will be my last visit to Koeglin Village."
"165399380-0-38640";"Have you ever noticed you just can't find a specific book when you really need it?\n\nGuess I'll just have to keep looking."
"165399380-0-38641";"Oh, it hurts! It hurts!"
"165399380-0-38647";"Yes? What do you need?"
"165399380-0-38648";"Get back, monster! I won't give in!"
"165399380-0-38660";"I'm glad Gelvin came to his senses.\n\nHe doesn't realize it yet, but sometimes you have to make wrong decisions for the right reasons. This was one of those times."
"165399380-0-38662";"I'm glad my brother came to his senses.\n\nI don't care if Diel is a bastard. As long as he pays Gelvin for his work and no one gets hurt, that's all that matters to me."
"165399380-0-38663";"I do hope you have both the thief and the egg with you. For everyone's sake."
"165399380-0-38664";"I need to think about all this, but I think I'm all right with how it turned out.\n\nThank you for helping us. Without you, the Daggers would have disbanded and we'd all go hungry again."
"165399380-0-38678";"Why did Zeht make this place such a desert? The horses' troughs never remain filled."
"165399380-0-38679";"Bhosek's horses live better than we do, curse him."
"165399380-0-38682";"Step back and wait your turn!"
"165399380-0-38683";"You're not staying for dinner too, are you?"
"165399380-0-38684";"This town's history is fascinating. Did you know that many of the Dwarven relics still function?"
"165399380-0-38691";"The quality of Orcish arms and armor are excellent, but their other goods …"
"165399380-0-38692";"He's going to survive. He has to!"
"165399380-0-38693";"No one is going to help us. We're all going to die here!"
"165399380-0-38694";"These northern lands are not to my liking. The mud is frozen, the trees do not speak to me, and the winds are bitter. I long for Black Marsh."
"165399380-0-38697";"It is gone. Everything. Torn away by the winds of death."
"165399380-0-38698";"Huh. More driftwood washed up from the sea. I'm Tazgol's forge-wife, so watch your tongue or I'll pull it out."
"165399380-0-38715";"Gelvin's sister gave up his location so easily. Now where is that damn thief?\n\nAnd where in the Eight is my damn egg?"
"165399380-0-38738";"Ah, see, another outlander. May you prosper in Sentinel more than I have. Stay moist."
"165399380-0-38746";"My sister the mercenary needs to get out of the house and find a job. If I bought her a new dagger, do you think she'd get the hint?"
"165399380-0-38747";"In Orsinium we would have settled this zombie nonsense before breakfast. If these Redguards are afraid of the dead, what good will they be against the living?"
"165399380-0-38748";"The dry side of the city is best, yes?  Less salt on the whiskers … and fewer guards."
"165399380-0-38749";"This one is happy he is a groundskeeper and not a dockworker. Eilam does not enjoy being eaten by zombies."
"165399380-0-38750";"The risen dead, almost within the city walls! This is what happens when a Forebear is king."
"165399380-0-38751";"Thank the Eight for imported mead. Little taste of home overseas, yeah? Ha!"
"165399380-0-38752";"You'll need a stout back to bear the weight of this armor—but you look like you're up to it. Have a look."
"165399380-0-38753";"You look dry! Wash the sand down with a pint, eh?"
"165399380-0-38754";"Quite a place, the Sentinel market. And the prices are acceptable—even for foreigners."
"165399380-0-38755";"I'm afraid these aren't for sale at present. I'm cataloguing inventory for the Mages Guild. They're obsessed with acquiring books like these.  \n\nYou should speak to them if you haven't already. Membership certainly has its benefits."
"165399380-0-38756";"I only swim here when the Redguards are not looking. The water is cool, and clean. \n\nToo clean."
"165399380-0-38758";"Those crates behind the target are brand new. A noble catches an arrow in the calf and suddenly it's safety first. What a joke."
"165399380-0-38759";"Why is it so hot here? Smells like … goats. Why does it smell like goats?"
"165399380-0-38760";"How do these Redguards stay cool while wearing so much fabric?"
"165399380-0-38763";"Glag works us hard, but he pays well. I guess he misses Wrothgar."
"165399380-0-38766";"This cat follows me all over town. And when he begs for food, he gets it.\n\nI should have been born a cat."
"165399380-0-38770";"Leki's Sparring Ring is closed to outsiders, but you may observe if you wish."
"165399380-0-38780";"By Tava's red feathers, I'm sick to death of these monkeys! I buy a brand new fez from the bazaar, and they make off with it."
"165399380-0-38782";"I'm going to go home, lock the doors, draw the windows shut, and sit quietly until this all blows over.  \n\nMay Onsi's justice come swiftly!"
"165399380-0-38783";"Have you been to the palace yet? It is a nest of asps and jackals. \n\nIf you are looking for the truth, you would be better served by speaking to the people."
"165399380-0-38790";"The Frozen Palms has become quite raucous since the Nord took over. If you prefer to drink in peace as I do, you should stay here or seek out the tea house."
"165399380-0-38792";"I stopped sparring here a long time ago.  Still enjoy watching, though."
"165399380-0-38793";"You have need of these goods, is it not so?"
"165399380-0-38797";"I hope he still has a few bottles of the seventy-four in here. This year's batch was shamefully harsh. Quite undrinkable."
"165399380-0-38799";"I have not seen much movement across the bridge since the docks came under attack. It is probably a good idea to stay indoors, wayfarer."
"165399380-0-38834";"Look at that statue. I wonder who that was? \n\nI bet he was some Forebear's ancestor. Think they're better than us, you know."
"165399380-0-38845";"We used to get more caravans from the south, but trade has been light recently.\n\nWith all this trouble at the docks, the well of prosperity may go dry before we know it."
"165399380-0-38852";"I meet you at last. I saw you defeat the scheming Redguard who rules Stros M'Kai. I see great events swirling about you."
"165399380-0-38853";"That's the package to be delivered to Magula, right?"
"165399380-0-38854";"I have a package for you."
"165399380-0-38888";"I can't wait to tell Haraldar that this bastard is dead. It won't bring Inga back, but I know I'll sleep better now."
"165399380-0-38898";"So Gelvin killed the bastard? I didn't think he had it in him.\n\nIt still doesn't change the fact that he botched our entire deal. I told you to talk him out of it."
"165399380-0-38899";"Diel's gone, but I don't feel any better. These people depended on me and I failed them.\n\nI can't even do one job correctly."
"165399380-0-38900";"Thank you for helping my brother. I was worried there for a bit, but it looks like everything worked out in the end."
"165399380-0-38901";"Wait. Does this mean I get to build more traps and gadgets now?\n\nThis is most excellent news."
"165399380-0-38902";"I knew Gelvin would come through!\n\nWe chose a good leader for the Daggers."
"165399380-0-38940";"What can I tell you about the magical arts?"
"165399380-0-38958";"Good to meet you here, where the river runs to the sea.\n\nCan I get you something from guild stores?"
"165399380-0-38968";"And what do you want? You're just here to gawk at the weaponry, aren't you? Make a purchase or shove off."
"165399380-0-38970";"Stand up straight, soldier! And tell me why I should train you."
"165399380-0-38972";"Good, good. You are safe."
"165399380-0-38975";"The Daggers, the new champions of Daggerfall, have been victorious this day!\n\nHah, I always wanted to say that. Well, actually, I wanted to say that since about five days ago. When we formed. But still."
"165399380-0-38976";"Gelvin actually went through with it. I'm surprised, to say the least.\n\nA little disappointed. A little happy. I'm so confused!"
"165399380-0-38978";"This is Abnur Tharn. The Master and I are very busy. This had better be important.\n\nWait a moment. I don't know your face. Identify yourself, immediately!"
"165399380-0-38984";"Oh, my head. No more drinking, I swear."
"165399380-0-38986";"I'm a little busy here. These guar don't skin themselves."
"165399380-0-38996";"<The body is warm to the touch. The odor of charred flesh suggests he was burned inside his armor.>"
"165399380-0-39006";"You're new to Daggerfall, aren't you? I know everyone in town."
"165399380-0-39007";"Thank Kynareth I found you! You don't know how many people I met who had been torn apart by these cultists and their creatures."
"165399380-0-39008";"Who's this, now? I bet you've got a wild tale or two to share."
"165399380-0-39009";"I hope you're not expecting a performance. I had to sell off my equipment and instruments just to make ends meet.\n\nTimes are tough, my friend."
"165399380-0-39010";"It's a fine day, isn't it? The fish are biting, and the water is soothing."
"165399380-0-39011";"Since the war began, the market has never been busier."
"165399380-0-39012";"I wasn't going to ask you for coin. I'm no beggar. I prefer to sleep out here, where it's warm."
"165399380-0-39017";"<<<1>>'s breathing is labored. She is not aware of her surroundings.>"
"165399380-0-39020";"Bloodthirsty savages! If they won't join the Covenant, they should be wiped out!"
"165399380-0-39037";"You don't look wounded. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-39043";"Urn …."
"165399380-0-39053";"Greetings! Blessings of Arkay upon you."
"165399380-0-39054";"I'm dying, aren't I? Hjorik keeps telling me I'm not, but I know I am."
"165399380-0-39056";"When the Empire was strong, the madness that has overcome Bruma would not have been possible."
"165399380-0-39063";"I couldn't take it down there anymore. I tried to help, but all that pain …. I just need a rest, just for a little while."
"165399380-0-39069";"Every day, the piles of dead and wounded grow and our supplies dwindle."
"165399380-0-39087";"<Sud-Hareem keeps his focus on the center of the room. He pays you little mind.>"
"165399380-0-39091";"Greetings, traveler! Blessings of Arkay upon you."
"165399380-0-39108";"No one said anything about haunted ruins and necromancers! I didn't sign up for this."
"165399380-0-39109";"Superbly done, as expected. I'll just take a look around now that you've cleared the way."
"165399380-0-39110";"Nothing but dusty tomes and rusty weapons. I expected tagging along with Neramo to be more lucrative."
"165399380-0-39111";"Foul cultists, defiling the souls of the dead. I hope we find more of them so I can cut down a few myself."
"165399380-0-39113";"Redguard architecture is so elegant, don't you think?\n\nFor human structures, that is."
"165399380-0-39114";"Did you see the way that one looked at me? They all look at me like that.\n\nDo you think it's the tusks?"
"165399380-0-39117";"My husband was supposed to meet me here for a drink after work. A few glasses of wine, some Redguard poetry ….\n\nI suspect I chose the wrong tavern. Or the wrong husband."
"165399380-0-39119";"I don't trust that Khajiit as far I can throw him, but then again, I don't have to pay him much."
"165399380-0-39123";"Too hot for me today. A person blessed with wisdom knows when to stay in the shade."
"165399380-0-39125";"The king, Ruptga's blessings be upon him, invites all his kinsmen to enjoy this garden.  \n\nWe need such tranquility in troubled times, is it not so?"
"165399380-0-39127";"There are far too many foreigners in the palace for my liking.  Present company excepted, of course. \n\nDo mind the carpets, though. Blessings!"
"165399380-0-39128";"Have you come to speak to the Forebear king? I have waited long and long and he does not even lift his eyes. \n\nSuch is the way of things for Crowns in Sentinel."
"165399380-0-39129";"Water is life. Without johad wells, our cities couldn't prosper.\n\nI dare not leave it while that Argonian lingers. I've heard distressing rumors."
"165399380-0-39131";"When I heard the commotion from the docks, I came here. There is no safer place than the house of the king. Is it not so?"
"165399380-0-39133";"The palace has been like a tomb since the news of trouble at the docks. I am sorry, wayfarer, but I fear you may not receive much hospitality today."
"165399380-0-39138";"I've no idea what most of this is, but I'm fairly certain you can't find it in Alinor. Smells like profit."
"165399380-0-39139";"I've not seen the dead wandering the streets yet, thank Tu'whacca!"
"165399380-0-39145";"There are foul doings at the docks. May Onsi's justice be visited upon those responsible."
"165399380-0-39151";"Is there a reason you're in the chief's chambers? \n\nIf not, be on your way!"
"165399380-0-39152";"Greetings, friend of Lambur. How can an old Orc help you?"
"165399380-0-39155";"Fair breezes unto you! I have all manner of needful things if you've a mind to buy. Please, feel free to browse."
"165399380-0-39157";"I don't have much left, but I'm still in business. For now, at least."
"165399380-0-39159";"You were among the crew that arrived with Lambur, yes? I envy you, free to see the world and make of your life whatever you wish."
"165399380-0-39166";"Rajhin's shadow! <<1>> thought you another monster, coming up to …. \n\nDo not surprise Zahra again!"
"165399380-0-39202";"Wait! Stop! Please don't hurt me."
"165399380-0-39205";"Beer! It brings us together. Can I interest you in some liquid courage?"
"165399380-0-39213";"This one does not sail the seas for riches. Instead, the riches sail to him."
"165399380-0-39247";"These bodies stink worse than High Elf perfume. Makes you wonder if these cultists were dead before they attacked."
"165399380-0-39248";"So many dead. You'd think even Bretons would know better than to attack an Orc fortress."
"165399380-0-39253";"Watch where you step. Still plenty of fresh corpses fouling up the place.\n\nCan't burn them soon enough, if you ask me."
"165399380-0-39255";"You stand on Orc soil, outlander. Tread carefully. This is not a good time to visit our island."
"165399380-0-39256";"Who're you? This is a dangerous place for the unwary."
"165399380-0-39258";"Ah, my friend! <<1>>'s compatriots had the <<2>> appraised! Its enchantments are much diminished, but still worthy of study. They even found a buyer in Morrowind!\n\nSuch songs they will sing of us! May Khenarthi's breath carry them far and wide!"
"165399380-0-39261";"Eyes of Akatosh! You just scared the oblivion out of me!\n\nI guess that's what I get for reading these scary books."
"165399380-0-39264";"Who … who are you? What are you doing in here? Everyone was supposed to be gone."
"165399380-0-39294";"I don't care what they say, I wasn't drunk! I saw something!"
"165399380-0-39307";"You have entered my son's dream. Some uncorrupted part of him has sent me to tell you what you need to know."
"165399380-0-39328";"I am sure that among Your Excellency's many virtues, generosity is paramount!"
"165399380-0-39329";"I hate taking things without asking, but a man's got to eat. If you saw anything, just keep it to yourself, all right?"
"165399380-0-39330";"Outlander. Have you met Lokra, the chief's daughter? She has a fascination with the lives of adventurers like you. It's unfortunate."
"165399380-0-39331";"This desert sun has dried my scales. Would that I could buy some fresh water!"
"165399380-0-39332";"Wanna kill something? I got what you need."
"165399380-0-39335";"We should just eat all the horses and be done with it."
"165399380-0-39336";"Curse this leg. I hate sitting here while Bruma burns!"
"165399380-0-39337";"The guards won't let me drink from the fountains. They won't let me climb the trees to eat figs.\n\nI must depend upon the generosity of strangers … like you."
"165399380-0-39338";"In the name of Morwha the compassionate, have mercy on a child of poverty."
"165399380-0-39339";"Don't mind me. A little dust-up with the town guard. Nothing serious. Just keep walking, all right?"
"165399380-0-39341";"You are a stranger to me. What do you want?"
"165399380-0-39342";"Is it too much to ask, that I have a few moments of peace?"
"165399380-0-39343";"I keep telling him to lie still and be quiet, but like all Nords, he's too thick-headed to listen to reason."
"165399380-0-39352";"Tall Papa aid me. Have you been to the docks, wayfarer? Half my inventory is missing. Probably ruined or looted. \n\nFahara'jad better settle this or he'll have a riot on his hands."
"165399380-0-39353";"My husband was supposed to meet me here. He was due to arrive at port today … oh, Ruptga help me."
"165399380-0-39362";"Just keep moving. Around here, folks are as likely to knife you as talk to you."
"165399380-0-39365";"Don't mind Dommy, she just likes to fuss over me. I'll be up on my feet and hacking cultists to bits in no time."
"165399380-0-39366";"Auri-el knows, I'm here to serve. What can I help you with?"
"165399380-0-39367";"Fivefold venerations, my friend. You've come to make a deposit, yes?"
"165399380-0-39386";"Thank you, again. Our injuries will heal, but I'll never forgive those Sea Drakes!"
"165399380-0-39395";"Thank you for your help in Vinedusk. It was a glorious battle."
"165399380-0-39405";"You're a true hero of Reaper's March. Your efforts will not be forgotten."
"165399380-0-39406";"Fine work, my friend. Vinedusk salutes you."
"165399380-0-39409";"Don't bother me, traveler. I must be ready to aid the Prince at a moment's notice."
"165399380-0-39410";"Such a waste of the Prince's time. That such a great man should be made to follow along after Ayrenn. Like a tamed hound!\n\nNaemon is no hound. He is a wolf."
"165399380-0-39427";"My husband died in the invasion … but I never liked him anyway. \n\n<<1>>, now that's a lizard I could wrap my fingers around!"
"165399380-0-39430";"<<1>> lives to drink and sell another day!"
"165399380-0-39432";"Thank you for saving me.\n\nThere has been so much death, so much destruction. I don't know if I can stay in Murkwater any longer."
"165399380-0-39435";"Murkwater is so quiet now."
"165399380-0-39445";"<This hunter hasn't been dead for very long. A notice of some kind lies on the ground nearby.>"
"165399380-0-39450";"Let the alliances fight over the castles. As long as they leave Cropsford alone, I don't care what they do to each other."
"165399380-0-39459";"Hey there. Want to know how to think like a Bramblebreach Bosmer?"
"165399380-0-39460";"Don't think I've seen you in the Rosy Lion before."
"165399380-0-39462";"These old cliffs and valleys … there are too many places to hide."
"165399380-0-39466";"Azartah exists to serve. How may I help?"
"165399380-0-39468";"Do you think the town walls are strong and solid? I think so. I think we're well and truly safe here."
"165399380-0-39480";"How do I look? Had to stretch the leather straps a little to make the armor fit, but I think I still make quite the impression. \n\nI'm ready for adventure… again. Perhaps we'll cross paths in the bottom of some dungeon, eh?"
"165399380-0-39548";"Wind, water, and sunshine. Everything that adds spice to life is also needed to clean clothes.\n\nIt is good that I enjoy my work, as there is always so much of it."
"165399380-0-39562";"This is not good. This is not good at all. These trees are unfamiliar. And there are spriggans and lurchers everywhere."
"165399380-0-39585";"A fine day here in Daggerfall."
"165399380-0-39593";"Don't look so shocked. I'm a member of the Mages Guild, not an Ebonheart spy."
"165399380-0-39616";"This one welcomes you to this humble Fighters Guild hall."
"165399380-0-39633";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-39658";"Just between you and me, my husband Beaubel and I are making a killing off these grunts."
"165399380-0-39662";"You look like someone who can appreciate the finer wares I have to offer."
"165399380-0-39667";"What? Not all of Clan Murtag are warriors. Who do you think they get their armor from?"
"165399380-0-39671";"Huh?"
"165399380-0-39672";"Who's there?"
"165399380-0-39684";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-39687";"TEST Text for bug reproduction purposes."
"165399380-0-39696";"You want to sign up? You ready to fight for your king?\n\nThe Covenant needs strong arms fighting for Cyrodiil. You sign up now and I'll make sure you get out there to fight those poxy Ebonheart and Aldmeri bastards right away. So, what say you?"
"165399380-0-39705";"And so your journey brings us together again. I was wondering if I might encounter you during my trip back to Wayrest."
"165399380-0-39712";"My Savior! My greetings and blessings upon you."
"165399380-0-39713";"Stay low! The Stormfists don't know we're here yet and I want to keep it that way."
"165399380-0-39723";"What can I fill you with today?"
"165399380-0-39724";"If I don't have it, you don't need it."
"165399380-0-39725";"Poor Mingor. He's not very bright. He'll never catch a fish that way."
"165399380-0-39726";"I know I could shoot these fish, if only they'd stop moving!"
"165399380-0-39742";"Trouble in the woods? Send the Wood Elf. He can deal with it. Bah!\n\nWhy do people think all Bosmer have an affinity for nature? That's like saying all Nords love mead. Oh. Wait a moment …."
"165399380-0-39743";"Something is wrong here, very wrong."
"165399380-0-39758";"I can't believe a spriggan got the drop on me. I'm going to turn that thing into kindling!"
"165399380-0-39761";"Hail, friend. We do meet each other in the most interesting places, don't we?"
"165399380-0-39762";"Well if it isn't the hero of Camlorn."
"165399380-0-39763";"You look hungry!"
"165399380-0-39764";"Well I'll be. What are you doing here?"
"165399380-0-39765";"You think you can handle Orcish brew?"
"165399380-0-39766";"The river of plenty flows through my stall, adventurer."
"165399380-0-39767";"I cannot wait until my next assignment. Orcs abhor ""outsider magic."""
"165399380-0-39770";"What're you hungry for?"
"165399380-0-39777";"The dreugh have become unsettled since the Dominion arrived."
"165399380-0-39778";"<The corpse of <<1>> looks different than the others you've seen at <<2>>.>"
"165399380-0-39781";"I agreed to guard this fool of a forester, but I never signed on to fight an army of trolls.\n\nI think we should head back to Windhelm and consider this camp to be a lost cause."
"165399380-0-39783";"Thulvald was right to bring me along. He never would have survived that troll attack without me.\n\nBut I've never heard of trolls roaming around in such large numbers. This is all very strange, if you ask me."
"165399380-0-39789";"Hmm? Can I help you with something? \n\nThe Fort Amol Guard barracks are off limits, so I hope you don't plan on trying to get inside."
"165399380-0-39845";"Nice night for a drink."
"165399380-0-39846";"I really needed this drink. These Dark Elves have the right swill for when you're trying your best to forget."
"165399380-0-39873";"The others can hide in the manor and church. I'm staying here. This is the most fun I've had in a long time."
"165399380-0-39874";"There's no end to these creatures!"
"165399380-0-39875";"Don't stop, now. Keep moving! More guards are on the way!"
"165399380-0-39884";"We are ready to attack. We await only your success with the door."
"165399380-0-39885";"Get this door open, and we'll fight our way to the relic!"
"165399380-0-39886";"We're with you. Captain Kaleen's going to lead us in as soon as you open the door."
"165399380-0-39887";"Orcs are dying, worse than dying. Get us in there!"
"165399380-0-39889";"<<1>> lives to drink and sell another day!"
"165399380-0-39890";"I have never seen anyone activate the welkynd stones before!"
"165399380-0-39905";"Same old crap, every day. If Tazgol would let us join the Covenant, we'd have stuff worth buying."
"165399380-0-39917";"The others have gone on ahead. I delayed here to discourage pursuit."
"165399380-0-39918";"Worry not, life still flows strongly through me. The others are waiting for you. I will be safe here."
"165399380-0-39919";"Stubborn Orcs. I told Master Peverel this was a mistake. They're not even part of the Covenant!"
"165399380-0-39920";"She was the beauty of the sea, the Silverfish. But her captain drank and she fetched aground. Such was the will of the Divines."
"165399380-0-39923";"This island's too small for a man of my ambition."
"165399380-0-39924";"Hard to make a living hunting around here. Between the Orcs, the Ayleid ghosts, and the cultists, game's scarce."
"165399380-0-39948";"Beds? Ha! There's some mulch piles if you're not tough enough to sleep on the ground."
"165399380-0-40032";"Lesser being … there is a void within you. I find it intriguing."
"165399380-0-40035";"Do not cross the Shadowscales. We have a long reach and even longer memories."
"165399380-0-40038";"Can you believe this? I thought I'd be in the tavern, three sheets to the wind by now."
"165399380-0-40052";"You want a drink? Go see the other girl. I'm all out."
"165399380-0-40054";"This place isn't safe for strangers. What are you doing here?"
"165399380-0-40075";"Be gone from this temple, there is nothing for you here."
"165399380-0-40106";"I shall remain aboard until we reach Daggerfall, my friend.\n\nAn island full of Orcs would try my patience."
"165399380-0-40127";"I see now. You were only thinking of the clan when you fled with my horn. You knew how great a threat my descendents faced, and that we would be needed to defend our land one final time.\n\nLet them come, then! None will break our line!"
"165399380-0-40145";"First time visitor to the Harvest Festival? Enjoy yourself. We love visitors!"
"165399380-0-40146";"This whole festival seems like a lot of nonsense, but it's all in good fun. What's the harm?"
"165399380-0-40148";"An outsider, are you? You're in for a few surprises before the day is out, I'll wager."
"165399380-0-40149";"It's a lovely day for a festival, isn't it? It's all so exciting!"
"165399380-0-40190";"<Cirion's body lies motionless.>"
"165399380-0-40203";"Wayfarer, what interest have you in a goat herder with no goats?"
"165399380-0-40262";"I don't think I can eat another bite."
"165399380-0-40265";"Enter and be welcome, friend! Make yourself at home!"
"165399380-0-40268";"More food! Keep it coming! I'm starving over here!"
"165399380-0-40269";"Where does Airia put it? She eats like twelve Orcs, that's for sure. She must have a hollow leg or something."
"165399380-0-40270";"After my thirteenth victory, they made me the judge. But I really want to get back in there are show them how to eat!"
"165399380-0-40271";"We're so busy because of the King's festival! It's almost enough to make me forget how terribly I miss Betra. Almost!"
"165399380-0-40283";"One cask of mead? Is that all they expect us to get through? What kind of contest is this?\n\nI'm sure I'll need another dozen."
"165399380-0-40284";"Tell Old Man Jeggi that he's going down! This year the trophy belongs to me!"
"165399380-0-40285";"Sorry, boys! If anyone's winning this contest, it's going to be me. Let's have another round!"
"165399380-0-40286";"They asked me to judge this contest, but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I've never had a drop of mead in my life."
"165399380-0-40292";"You're standing too close. I'm trying to watch the bard perform. She's very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean."
"165399380-0-40293";"Please, friend, I need to concentrate. I am the judge of this competition, after all."
"165399380-0-40297";"Her voice is as soothing as the healing mud of Black Marsh."
"165399380-0-40303";"Since Arani started performing here, the number of male customers has increased dramatically."
"165399380-0-40315";"I just joined the Royal Work Crew! I'll be repairing the roads of Eastmarch in no time."
"165399380-0-40320";"The Cold-Moon Stables might be larger, but we provide a much better level of service."
"165399380-0-40322";"Another busy day at Windhelm Bank. It's the safest spot in town."
"165399380-0-40324";"As soon as I finish my chores, Papa says I can go watch the eating contest!"
"165399380-0-40378";"I can't believe my partner and I have to travel all the way out here from Wayrest. What do you want?"
"165399380-0-40383";"You really know how to make an entrance! But forcing your way into the Prince of Murder's realm … that takes exceptional bravery. Or is it unprecedented stupidity? No matter.\n\nClearly, you came here for a purpose."
"165399380-0-40385";"You've come to put hammer to anvil, yes? I have some goods you might be interested in. \n\nRemember that Onsi's eyes are upon you. Mind the angle and strike true."
"165399380-0-40389";"Welcome, friend! Has the sun gone to rest yet? My scales dry and crack in this heat. Fortunately I have potions and ointments of all kinds—far better than those found in the marketplace."
"165399380-0-40390";"So you're an enchanter? Or just getting out of the heat? \n\nI sell enchantments—top quality only. Poor enchantments can cause … complications."
"165399380-0-40391";"How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-40418";"I am Oromin, head of Thalmor affairs here in the fair city of Woodhearth.\n\nYou may speak if you have business with me, otherwise I would ask that you leave me to my work. Fariel may be more suited to help you."
"165399380-0-40424";"Wayfarer! Would you be wise in the ways of the desert? Hearken to what I have to tell you."
"165399380-0-40426";"<The corpse of an Altmer female lies cold upon the stone floor. She has clearly been dead for a considerable length of time.>"
"165399380-0-40428";"Didakah is a wise man. Didakah purchases very shiny object for what he told is a great price. This one is wise indeed, and now owner of a new shiny."
"165399380-0-40429";"Welcome to my store, Adept!"
"165399380-0-40431";"Eyes open, my friend. We are not out of this yet."
"165399380-0-40432";"To learn is to live! To live is to eat! To eat, you must cook! To cook … you must have the right supplies."
"165399380-0-40434";"Hmm hmm hmm … by Stars, Moons, and Green! Sorry, sorry. The whole pub broke into song last night in Skywatch. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-40439";"And what, my good adept, can I do for you today?"
"165399380-0-40449";"Do you smell that? The magicka on the air, fragrant as the wind off of a sand dune. Ahh.\n\nWhat can this one help you with?"
"165399380-0-40452";"You the one with the delivery for Dariah?\n\nShe's right back there. Tell her no more excuses. I'm ready to eat my biscuits!"
"165399380-0-40495";"Why does the Dominion send Hazazi to places like this?"
"165399380-0-40501";"My eggsister's mind is dry with madness. Do not buy from her. Purchase what you need from me."
"165399380-0-40503";"Scales can only protect you so much, adept. I recommend heavier plates to keep you safe."
"165399380-0-40504";"You have to believe me when I tell you this. The Lord, the Mother, and the Wizard all three want you to buy from me."
"165399380-0-40505";"Spices, sauces, sausages, more! You name it, I've got it galore!"
"165399380-0-40506";"The Mages Guild is fortunate indeed! This Eyevea … the perfect place to practice spellwork and sell my leatherwork!"
"165399380-0-40518";"Welcome, welcome, welcome! To the best selection of heavy plate armor on this island full of wizards! I don't regret coming here at all!"
"165399380-0-40520";"Rigurt is glorious master of ceremonies of glorious Corn-loon-licker! I am so proud!\n\nBut don't tell him where I am. I want to enjoy the party, not work it."
"165399380-0-40521";"Tell me honestly … how do my eyebrows look? No, never mind. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-40522";"Strong wood and taught bow strings, newly made by the finest crafters in Daggerfall. And now, awaiting your light touch."
"165399380-0-40523";"Joyful day! Know, wayfarer, that the waters of magicka flow freely from these robes."
"165399380-0-40524";"Peace be upon you, wayfarer. If I can give you some friendly advice? Don't bother with robes. They are for scholars and old women."
"165399380-0-40525";"I know you're looking for me. I'm showing myself to tell you to leave. Tell Thorinor you found me dead. It'll be true enough soon.\n\nI'm going to end my life before I turn."
"165399380-0-40526";"A blade in the hand is worth two in the back, if you catch my meaning. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-40527";"Bright steel and hot coals! What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-40528";"Heavy bags weigh down even the greatest Arch-Mage. Allow me to lighten your load?"
"165399380-0-40542";"Sorry, sorry. Much to catalog, less time to talk. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-40545";"I'll have to make another trip to Woodhearth soon to replenish my ingredients. If you have your own, you're welcome to use my tools."
"165399380-0-40546";"Fine woodwork from Cyrodiil and beyond!"
"165399380-0-40549";"There's so much to learn on Eyevea! Like, who knew there were this many kinds of brew in the world?"
"165399380-0-40569";"Hey there adept! Be one of the first to get new goods just off the boat from Auridon!"
"165399380-0-40572";"Greetings traveler."
"165399380-0-40576";"Welcome to Longhaven! Used to be a busier place, before the trouble with the mist started. But we won't let that be an excuse for poor hospitality."
"165399380-0-40577";"Turn back. That way's bad omens. Even the air's turned against them in Longhaven."
"165399380-0-40578";"Begone. I must finish my prayers and purify my spirit before I meet my foes in battle."
"165399380-0-40585";"You kept your head and did very well, my friend. The Fighters Guild owes you a debt.  \n\nBefore you go, you should take that crystal over there. I'm no scholar, but I bet it's a Light of Meridia. That's probably why Ifriz kept it behind the barrier."
"165399380-0-40588";"Enough idle talk. Let us hunt."

"165399380-0-40637";"The kagouti walk amongst the guar, but do not hunt unless the guar strays from her herd. Then wooden wasps would fly, bringing the guar down to the mud."
"165399380-0-40681";"Enak is a valued assistant. I am disappointed at his failure to outwit this door, however."
"165399380-0-40683";"Brelynd pays well. Good thing for her or I'd be using her head for a battering ram."
"165399380-0-40684";"You there! Have you seen my squad?"
"165399380-0-40691";"Who are you? Were you part of the fleet?"
"165399380-0-40692";"Bless Y'ffre, I'm glad you came by! Have you seen any other marines along the beach?"
"165399380-0-40693";"I lost a lot of friends in that storm. Give me some good news."
"165399380-0-40737";"<You can reach your hand through the opening in the head to deposit your choice of reagents.>"
"165399380-0-40744";"<Tied to a blood-stained post is the body of a Wood Elf marine. He appears to have died recently.>"
"165399380-0-40748";"Rum. Nothing but rum.\n\nWho do I have to gut for a flagon of wine around here?"
"165399380-0-40751";"""Let's open an inn!"" he says. ""We'll be rich and have the time of our lives!"" he says. We're in the middle of nowhere and get hardly any customers!\n\nWe'd have been happier farming."
"165399380-0-40754";"Cabbage, salted pork, rum … dear gods, the Prowler will smell like a flux-riddled mammoth if we can't improve her stores."
"165399380-0-40755";"Rasala thinks we made a mistake opening an inn here. Sure, we're off the beaten track, have trouble getting supplies, and our only customers are bandits who never pay. \n\nWe just need more time to work things out!"
"165399380-0-40756";"In Alik'r I played for royalty. Here … nobody.\n\nI agreed to play for a portion of the inn's profits. That Leono, he really pulled one over on me."
"165399380-0-40878";"So … weak …."
"165399380-0-40903";"I'll handle this, Zur. You can come out and see in a moment.\n\nSo, someone has come to help us at last!"
"165399380-0-40929";"<A strange aura surrounds <<c:1>>'s corpse. His body is warm to the touch. A faint smell of sulfur permeates the room.>"
"165399380-0-40977";"Ah, what a terrible existence."
"165399380-0-41005";"I suppose I'm getting used to the taste of mead. Still, I'd pay good gold for a jug of flin."
"165399380-0-41010";"Are you lost? Ambassador <<1>>'s quarters aren't open for visitors."
"165399380-0-41012";"Floors that don't sway. Sand that creeps into boots. Bugs the size of anchors!\n\nMay the gods see me posted to a proper ship."
"165399380-0-41016";"I make the finest ales throughout the Frostwater Tundra."
"165399380-0-41019";"If you're not here to help, get off my ship."
"165399380-0-41020";"One soup. As long as it's delicious, that's all anyone ever needs!"
"165399380-0-41023";"This Elf is mad! I deal in reagents, not instruments of death!"
"165399380-0-41024";"I am honored to represent the Fighter's Guild in General Godrun's presence."
"165399380-0-41027";"There's no situation so bad that a dead horse can't make it worse."
"165399380-0-41031";"This company needs a good minstrel, then perhaps there would be someone worth conversing with."
"165399380-0-41042";"Can you fight? We have a serious situation here and we need all the sword and spell-arms we can get."
"165399380-0-41069";"Maormer, eh? This could be fun."
"165399380-0-41075";"Repairs go faster with a drink in hand!"
"165399380-0-41082";"Have the sigil-trees been reactivated yet?"
"165399380-0-41090";"Well, there. You look like someone who could use some coin. How about running a simple errand for me? It'll pay well."
"165399380-0-41094";"The situation developing across Eastmarch has the Mages Guild quite concerned."
"165399380-0-41095";"The Fighters Guild is watching the situation here in Skyrim very closely."
"165399380-0-41096";"My oh my, these soldiers sure are a thirsty lot! I can hardly keep up with the demand!"
"165399380-0-41097";"I've got this! You keep moving."
"165399380-0-41101";"Gods' bless! I'll handle this."
"165399380-0-41104";"You look like a person of great intelligence. Allow me, wayfarer, to let you in on a secret."
"165399380-0-41106";"All of these wars and rumors of war make it very difficult for scholars to advance their studies."
"165399380-0-41109";"Fortune favors you! Keep it up. I'll take over here."
"165399380-0-41116";"If you wish to raid Sercen, wait your turn. Our claim takes precedence.\n\nIf you wish some coin, I offer a task."
"165399380-0-41160";"You don't look like much. This one hopes <<1>> knows of what he speaks."
"165399380-0-41174";"A good drink cures whatever ails you. And I know how to make very good drinks."
"165399380-0-41175";"Soup is for dryskins! Now a stew. A stew is a meal!"
"165399380-0-41176";"I have to commend the Nords. They certainly know how to throw a grand party. Almost makes me sorry that I'm stuck inside catching up on Mages Guild paperwork. There's always paperwork. It never seems to end."
"165399380-0-41179";"A strong plan wins a battle, and a perfect plan wins the war."
"165399380-0-41184";"Oh, perfect. My favorite people. The very faces of my failure … and now you've tracked me down just to watch me die?\n\nYou're just like my sister and the rest of the Thalmor. No sympathy whatsoever."
"165399380-0-41185";"The time has come to destroy the Mortuum Vivicus."
"165399380-0-41188";"Sauce. That's the secret to great cooking. A good sauce. And spice.\n\nA good sauce and a little heat can hide any other imperfections in your cooking techniques."
"165399380-0-41189";"The best armor in all of Skyrim! Get it here and get it now! No waiting!"
"165399380-0-41192";"Ugh. My stock is probably ruined."
"165399380-0-41193";"Oh! Hey there! Welcome to my eatery! Are you feeling hungry? Me, I'm always hungry."
"165399380-0-41194";"Greetings, wayfarer. I'm sorry, but I have nothing to sell. I'm just packing up my sister's things."
"165399380-0-41195";"These Redguards are slow to reopen their shops. Halinad is not slow, and has much to sell. Please look."
"165399380-0-41196";"I'm leaving. I can never fish here again. This has ruined it."
"165399380-0-41197";"Fish aren't biting. I'm afraid they might never bite again."
"165399380-0-41198";"I always hated this boat. Now I'm going to have to pay some Argonians to yank the damn thing out. To Sovngarde with the Alik'r!"
"165399380-0-41199";"Fair winds and blessings, my friend!"
"165399380-0-41214";"This one promises to bring money next month! No, next week!"
"165399380-0-41215";"I wasn't stealing, I just slipped and put my hand in his coin pouch!"
"165399380-0-41217";"Shor's bones! Look what the jackals dragged in! Ha! I'm just yanking your helmet-horns. What'll you have?"
"165399380-0-41218";"I'm trying to write a ballad about the Harvest Festival. You'd be amazed how hard it is to find words that rhyme with ""festival."""
"165399380-0-41220";"This is my first Harvest Festival, but I'm having a wonderful time!"
"165399380-0-41223";"They can sacrifice all the apples and grain they want, just tell them to keep their hands off the wine!"
"165399380-0-41224";"If you're not careful, this desert air will turn your tongue to jerky. How about a drink?"
"165399380-0-41225";"I foresaw your coming, strange one. In my vision, you bought many of my finest items.  \n\nYou don't want to buck the forces of prophecy do you?"
"165399380-0-41226";"You'll need to bear more than water across the dunes. Why not make sure you have room for all that is needful?"
"165399380-0-41227";"Your belly growls like a duneripper! You should sit and abide for a while. Even the mightiest heroes have to eat."
"165399380-0-41228";"Cast your eyes over my wares. I swear by Tava's bright feathers, we've got everything you might need."
"165399380-0-41233";"You checking up on me?"
"165399380-0-41235";"You … did I overhear you correctly? Vampires were the source of the creatures and the corrupted mist? Tell me it isn't so."
"165399380-0-41236";"You look light on your feet. Have a look at my stock of armor. You might find something you fancy."
"165399380-0-41238";"Greetings! I sell the finest garments from Alik'r and beyond. You'll need a fresh tunic if you're heading off into the dunes."
"165399380-0-41239";"You address the seneschal of King Fahara'jad's court. Spare me your foreign preambles and tell me your business here."
"165399380-0-41244";"Swords aloft, warriors! With the blessings of Onsi's bright blade, the Covenant banner marches forward. Are you ready to make war upon the enemies of the Alik'r?"
"165399380-0-41246";"By Onsi's bright blade, I welcome you, wayfarer. You are in the Sentinel branch of the House of Leki, patron of swordswomen and swordsmen. In this place, we honor her through meditation and combat."
"165399380-0-41247";"I'm afraid I can't tarry. I'm on an errand for the Mages Guild. They don't like to be kept waiting—especially Master Eteldil."
"165399380-0-41249";"Cordial greetings, and welcome to the tower: an isle of knowledge amidst a vast sea of ignorance.  \n\nHave you come for training?"
"165399380-0-41251";"Well met! I'm the resident librarian. We don't have much, but what we have I care for. Have you found anything to add to our collection?"
"165399380-0-41253";"Here at the priory, I have found the peace I never knew as an adventurer. Perhaps someday you will find this as well.\n\nIf you're looking for work, Mael is in need of assistance."
"165399380-0-41254";"Akatosh's blessings upon you. All are welcome to worship at the eternal flame of Akatosh."
"165399380-0-41256";"<<1>> asks how I find you so swiftly. I tell him I look for the one trudging as if their feet were stuck in the soft mud-sucks of Black Marsh.\n\nUp, up. Lift your feet up. Surely you've seen Zaeri run enough by now that you recognize good form, yes?"
"165399380-0-41257";"Ah, a visitor! Do you have a moment to talk about Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time?"
"165399380-0-41282";"The horses are restless. I think they sense the taint of necromancy better than we do."
"165399380-0-41356";"<Indanas was slain.>"
"165399380-0-41362";"You have my gratitude."
"165399380-0-41363";"Y'ffre knows what would have happened to me if you hadn't come along."
"165399380-0-41367";"This one owes you her life."
"165399380-0-41368";"Did you kill it? Is the Hollow Lord dead?"
"165399380-0-41369";"Have you slain Sangur?"
"165399380-0-41372";"Welcome to <<1:)>>! Though … normally, everyone isn't stranded by a storm this way."
"165399380-0-41378";"My friends are going to murder you for this, just you wait!"
"165399380-0-41390";"You are the outsider who has done so much for my people. I am grateful.\n\nPerhaps when this is over, my people can live without fear or worry."
"165399380-0-41391";"What's this now?"
"165399380-0-41418";"Who knew that being a stablehand was such hard work? If I had some money, I'd leave this place and never look back."
"165399380-0-41455";"Curse those Arbordawn idiots! I'll be bald for life!"
"165399380-0-41456";"Why am I stuck in this forsaken mud pit near all these tree lovers?"
"165399380-0-41457";"Please excuse me, but I need to finish packing the Great Mage's tent. I want to be done when <<1>> returns!"
"165399380-0-41458";"Can you believe where we are? A Falinesti site! I've dreamed of visiting a site like this since I was a little boy in Aldcroft. I can't believe I'm actually here!"
"165399380-0-41480";"It's peaceful here, isn't it? As long as the cold doesn't bother you. The fish here taste much better than those caught in warmer lakes."
"165399380-0-41494";"Now what were we talking about? Oh, I remember!\n\nBefore my people will even listen to you, you need to perform an honor deed. It has to be an act that benefits my clan. Something they would expect one of us to be able to accomplish."
"165399380-0-41498";"The sun and salt are bad for injuries. If you are wounded, get to the encampment in the shadow of those towers. <<1>> will have you up in no time."
"165399380-0-41499";"Unless you're in serious pain, I can't help you right now. I have too many patients to attend."
"165399380-0-41504";"This one can't believe you crossed this chamber without so much as an illusion to mask your presence. You are so brave! This one? Zur's whiskers were twitching inside the Dark Elf's head!"
"165399380-0-41506";"Trying to do everything myself is killing me."
"165399380-0-41507";"The ship was too close to shore, even before the storm hit. I said as much before she sank."
"165399380-0-41510";"Can you heal my wounds? Better yet, heal the others. If they stop moaning and groaning, I can finally get some rest."
"165399380-0-41513";"An Altmer ship would have survived the tempest intact."
"165399380-0-41514";"I'll wait until there's more room amongst the injured. My wound isn't as bad as some of the others I've seen."
"165399380-0-41516";"I'm not used to seeing so much open space. This is my first sea voyage."
"165399380-0-41518";"A little privacy, please!"
"165399380-0-41519";"It's a wonder anyone survived! Did you see the wreck?"
"165399380-0-41520";"A lot of folks were injured in the storm. Good thing there's a town nearby, even if it is full of Khajiit."
"165399380-0-41521";"Everyone's ready to pass the blame, even folks who know nothing about ships and sailing."
"165399380-0-41522";"Have you no shame?"
"165399380-0-41526";"Strange winds blow lately. The air's full of salt and sorrow!"
"165399380-0-41527";"Nasimar prepared for such an event, but there are more injuries than expected. Sleep is best for them now."
"165399380-0-41529";"Many new faces, many new clients, yes? Business will be good for Duharr soon!"
"165399380-0-41555";"You don't look tough enough to have beaten the lamia champion, but even a mighty storm starts with a light breeze.\n\nStill, an honor deed is an honor deed. Maybe the council of elders will actually agree to meet with you."
"165399380-0-41556";"You're lucky, outsider. The only thing keeping me from sticking my knife in you right now is our code.\n\nBut if you think I'm going to help you, think again."
"165399380-0-41557";"I don't remember the last time I talked to an outsider. Killed one? Sure, I do that all the time. But talk? That's a new one for me.\n\nI was born and bred in these woods. Never ventured outside its borders. Always wondered what was out there."
"165399380-0-41558";"Faraniel is like a sister to me. I almost convinced her to give up her foolish plan, and then you showed up!\n\nWell, since you made it this far, we might as well try it her way. I guess any chance—no matter how remote—is worth the trouble."
"165399380-0-41559";"Use the portal behind me to reach the council.\n\nThey didn't want to meet with you at first. They can be extremely stubborn when they want to be. But when I dropped the lamia champion's head at their feet, they quickly changed their minds."
"165399380-0-41565";"I see the delight in your eyes. You want something special, yes?"
"165399380-0-41566";"Did you come in with the storm? I'm sure you've worked up a thirst out there."
"165399380-0-41567";"He may be a drunk, but <<1>> is one sleek walker. Wait and see."
"165399380-0-41572";"This is a great privilege, allowing you to stand here. Never before has an outsider been permitted to set foot on this platform. My daughter, however, was insistent that we speak with you.\n\nWe shall hear what you have to say."
"165399380-0-41573";"Spew forth your lies and be quick about it. I have a great many things to contemplate today."
"165399380-0-41574";"You poor child! Dealing with those disgusting lamias as you navigated the Moonless Walk must have been so unnerving. Such horrible creatures!\n\nNow, sad little Faraniel mentioned that you bring us news from Nirn. What is it?"
"165399380-0-41575";"You've accomplished much, outsider. Survived the Moonless Walk, performed an honor deed. Well done!\n\nI shall listen to your words and consider them with great respect. I promise you this much, at least. Now tell me. Why are you here?"
"165399380-0-41576";"Everything this one sells is fresh. Except for what's clearly marked old."
"165399380-0-41577";"There's nothing like a good fire to warm one's weaponry, my friend."
"165399380-0-41581";"Hey, look. A hero came to save the day."
"165399380-0-41597";"You don't look like you belong in this awful place."
"165399380-0-41598";"I have work to complete before the Taskmaster returns."
"165399380-0-41610";"This one has an escape plan. So simple. So elegant. This one just needs the machines to stop working and away we go."
"165399380-0-41613";"Alexis? Is that you Alexis? I've missed you so!"
"165399380-0-41615";"Don't know why I bother. I no sooner patch one hole then another quake hits and more of the walls fall apart."
"165399380-0-41617";"Welcome to the Oak and Crosier. Don't worry about that fissure. It's been rumbling and shaking for years, and we're still here.\n\nHow can I help you?"
"165399380-0-41620";"What is it? I need to record my latest observation of the fissure's activity before foolish chatter wipes it from my mind.\n\nPlease go away."
"165399380-0-41623";"I'm sitting on a pier, ready to end it all, and <<Ac:1>> appears. ""Don't give up,"" he says. ""The Green provides for all its saplings, you just need a patch of sun.""\n\n<<2>> comes to me the next day, looking for sailors! To think I nearly gave up."
"165399380-0-41624";"And the Mane spoke, ""Look to Riddle'Thar! Did he surrender ja-Kha'jay to Skooma Cat and the others? No! He kept it close for all of us, under his belly for all to follow!""\n\nIt is true, you know?"
"165399380-0-41626";"When I don't catch enough to feed my family, I sleep beneath the docks. It's safer that way."
"165399380-0-41627";"Welcome to my humble abode! A place with a roof costs much more than an open area like this."
"165399380-0-41630";"What do you think goes on inside these buildings? Why live inside at all, when Mistral is so beautiful?"
"165399380-0-41639";"What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen a Nord wait for a magic tree to return from … wherever?"
"165399380-0-41640";"I don't care what Mother says. I'm not going home until I see Falinesti with my own eyes! In the meantime, can I get you something?"
"165399380-0-41641";"I hope those fool Arbordawn cultists don't come back here. They have this look in their eyes that chills my bones. Crazy fools!"
"165399380-0-41643";"The ale's weak, the bread's stale, and the weather's too warm. I hope this whole village slides into the fissure soon."
"165399380-0-41646";"Farisel's going to crack one joke too many and end up eating Blodrat's sword. I'd pay to see that!"
"165399380-0-41651";"Don't know why I come in here. Can't be the ale or the company."
"165399380-0-41652";"Another traveler, by the looks of you. If you're heading north, you may want to explore the Sancre Tor ruins. It's a major historical site; many former emperors are buried there.\n\nI couldn't get close—too many undead. But you might."
"165399380-0-41656";"Too many foreigners in Chorrol nowadays. I hope that fissure swallows every non-Imperial here!"
"165399380-0-41658";"Sit down and rest a while, friend. Don't try to move any of the furniture though. We had to nail it to the floor because of all the quakes."
"165399380-0-41663";"Between the vapors from the fissure and the dust from the earthquakes, cleaning this place is a never-ending task.\n\nExcuse me, please."
"165399380-0-41692";"I have the finest in armor available. Well, some of it's not all that fine, but it's still decent quality."
"165399380-0-41703";"The view is quite entrancing. If only smells didn't waft upward."
"165399380-0-41704";"I've never had such a difficult time deciding. Especially in a shop with such few goods."
"165399380-0-41705";"I love <<1>>, but it is good to see Altmeri faces again."
"165399380-0-41707";"I do hope <<1>> comes to his senses. Since grandmother died, he isn't himself.\n\nHe's never been a heavy sleeper. Lately he's taken to wandering <<2>> at night! He's even changed the way he dresses!"
"165399380-0-41708";"<<1>> was built on an ancient Khajiiti temple. Without proper maintenance the ruins could collapse, taking the city with them!"
"165399380-0-41736";"I don't have anything to steal, or sell. No sugar, nothing."
"165399380-0-41737";"I am unused to begging, but with so many mouths to feed, what choice do I have?"
"165399380-0-41738";"We'll be cleaning up after that storm for some time to come. And I don't just mean the docks."
"165399380-0-41740";"Some dislike the way <<1>> runs <<2>>, but this is such a tiny island. Storms, pirates, even the Maormer threaten us, yet we are still here!\n\nOur leader, she is clever, yes? She sees what must be done and does it! How many others can say the same?"
"165399380-0-41744";"I'll not leave my cousin behind. You're on your own from here."
"165399380-0-41748";"Maormer just walking around like they own the place. Mark my words, this entire island will regret dealing with those sea rats."
"165399380-0-41749";"What good is a wall if the sand blows over it? I'll have words with the Magistrate about this."
"165399380-0-41752";"We simply let their ship dock right here in town? <<1>> has lost her mind."
"165399380-0-41757";"So. I bet, then I roll the dice? Or is it the other way round? \n\nTall Papa help me."
"165399380-0-41758";"Oh, hello. You caught me off guard. My pretense is that I am doing research, but I really come to watch Bailiff Trayard. \n\nBy Tall Papa's starry breeches, he is handsome beyond measure."
"165399380-0-41770";"Before you ask, no, you can't have my bed. Now go find some other place to stay."
"165399380-0-41775";"Unless you're offering to pay my debts to Uncle Thakh, I'd appreciate it if you let me be."
"165399380-0-41780";"A thousand pardons, wayfarer, but I am still taking inventory. \n\nI believe Nabeenim across the street is offering general goods. Visit her and convey my regards."
"165399380-0-41788";"In her tale, Aranias was volatile and she swung between anger, shame, and hope. Feared by her own parents because of her abilities, she faced the bandits alone.\n\nThis made her bitter and hardened against others. Vulnerable to outside influences."
"165399380-0-41792";"I don't actually need new armor or anything. I just like coming here to get warm."
"165399380-0-41797";"I hate to admit it, but there is a certain charm to this place. If only it were cleaner."
"165399380-0-41798";"Heaven's sun shines brightest on Redguard steel. Gaze upon my wares. You'll not find better blades in all Tamriel."
"165399380-0-41803";"If you cleave to Fahara'jad and the Covenant, do not expect a warm welcome here in Bergama. There are many Crowns here, and they disapprove of such new-fangled ideas."
"165399380-0-41804";"Only in Bergama would the honored warriors of the Covenant be forced to train in a goat sty such as this. Accursed Crowns. I hope my writ of transfer comes soon."
"165399380-0-41815";"The wine selection here isn't all that impressive. But at least they have some bottles from the Hegathe vineyards. All you get in the inn is cactus pear cordials—at twice the price, to boot."
"165399380-0-41817";"This music is fine if you've an ear for the traditional. The performance is predictable, though—just like everything else Crowns produce."
"165399380-0-41819";"I must ask you to find another table, wayfarer. I have this man drunk enough to bet, but not so drunk that he falls asleep. It is a delicate dance that requires my careful attention."
"165399380-0-41826";"Someone tell this doddering old coot to place his bet."
"165399380-0-41832";"Our honored dead may be rising to plague us, but someone has to keep the spirits flowing. I don't know about you, but dread makes me thirsty."
"165399380-0-41834";"I am certain I can win my money back. Certain as sunrise. Just a few more games, then I walk away for good."
"165399380-0-41846";"Malooc take all this disappearance nonsense—I just want my writ of ownership! Those goats will starve before I get them back to Kozanset."
"165399380-0-41847";"Greetings, my friend! You have a fair amount of equipment there. I'd wager you need something to hold it all."
"165399380-0-41849";"I've watched this Forebear and Crown staring each other down for hours. Even a stump-brained Orc like me knows to stay out of that mess."
"165399380-0-41856";"Magicked goods are hard to come by in Redguard country, but I think you'll find this assortment of soul gems impressive nonetheless."
"165399380-0-41857";"Being an Orc in Bergama is miserable. Getting charity out of a Crown is like squeezing ale out of a skeever's arse."
"165399380-0-41859";"Hrm. Quiet today. I don't like it."
"165399380-0-41862";"These Crowns don't pay us Orcs much, but it's better than living on the street. \n\nI guess."
"165399380-0-41865";"Do you mind? I get so little time to write in this cursed place."
"165399380-0-41879";"Many tasty bugs hide in the crevices of old stone like this. And I am hungry."
"165399380-0-41901";"My father catches fish with his bare hands. Soon as I find one, I'm gonna do the same."
"165399380-0-41913";"Desolation overwhelms this one. The horse is missing, gone in the night. Without a horse, the wagon does not move. Where the wagon stays, this one stays. Purchase some goods?"
"165399380-0-41918";"How can this humble servant aid you?"
"165399380-0-41929";"You haven't seen my sister Thiirril, have you?"
"165399380-0-41930";"Curse those decadent Nibenese, trying to spread their foul Daedra worship across Cyrodiil. A few came to Chorrol, but we chased them out. I hope wild animals tear them to pieces on the road!"
"165399380-0-41990";"I haven't the heart to tell him there aren't any fish in there."
"165399380-0-42042";"Tava's blessings to you. You are new to Sentinel, I think. You wonder how I know? The sun has barely kissed your cheeks yet."
"165399380-0-42047";"Keep some distance from the beast. It is only my long exposure to it that allows me to tolerate the smell."
"165399380-0-42094";"Ah, I think it's working. I can feel the soul-meld unraveling."
"165399380-0-42096";"It feels like my very essence is being shredded."
"165399380-0-42101";"The city returns to life, thanks to you. The Mages Guild and the Fighters Guild have joined forces and believe the time to strike is fast approaching.\n\nWar is coming, champion. May the light guide us."
"165399380-0-42116";"<<1>> asks for patience. Easy for her to say when my men are still out there! The longer we wait, the fewer will come back."
"165399380-0-42121";"This is my favorite spot in the priory. Nature's beauty is spread before me, yet I can feel the warmth of Akatosh's presence at my back."
"165399380-0-42124";"I've been told this staff casts an opacity spell over the windows, and it needs to be renewed constantly.\n\nI suspect the older acolytes are playing a trick on me."
"165399380-0-42135";"Please speak to an acolyte. I am preparing for our next service to Akatosh."
"165399380-0-42170";"Urp, land … have we reached land?"
"165399380-0-42191";"Another day, another dead Daedra."
"165399380-0-42212";"Tu'whacca's breath, how could we have left so many bodies beneath the waves for this long? Had we cared for our honored dead properly and buried them, none of this would have happened."
"165399380-0-42214";"I heard a stranger helped save the Great Tree. Thank you!"
"165399380-0-42215";"Just got to clear away this brush before auntie gets mad. Thank Y'ffre that foul green stuff is gone!"
"165399380-0-42216";"I'm sorry, but I can't talk long. I'm preparing for the trip back to the shipyards at Tava's Blessing. Some of our finest warships are berthed there, and they always need fresh provisions."
"165399380-0-42218";"I thought the most dangerous things in the shallows were mudcrabs. May Mauloch yank out my tusks if I ever swim again."
"165399380-0-42219";"As soon as I finish taking inventory, I'm off to Wayrest. If you see a weasel-faced diplomat, tell him he'll have to book passage with a different captain."
"165399380-0-42220";"The dryskins' boats sink and suddenly I am everyone's friend."
"165399380-0-42221";"Watch your step, ground walker."
"165399380-0-42225";"Hello. I think you must have the wrong person.\n\nI only speak to two kinds of people, and you seem to be neither of them."
"165399380-0-42226";"Ya? Need something to wash that salt out of your throat, am I right?"
"165399380-0-42243";"How did someone like you get an invite to the party?"
"165399380-0-42291";"You are the one who struck the Ra-Netu? You will forgive me for not taking your hand in friendship."
"165399380-0-42292";"Oh! Hello, wayfarer. I am sorry, my mind wanders."
"165399380-0-42293";"I am ashamed to be working with what's going on downstairs. This old warehouse may well become sacred ground."
"165399380-0-42297";"Welcome to Cyrodiil, soldier. Here to help out in the war?"
"165399380-0-42308";"War is certainly good for business. We're having trouble keeping up with demand. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-42332";"Very flammable materials here. Watch your tail."
"165399380-0-42339";"Kill any ogrim lately? Wouldn't mind bashing a few of their thick skulls myself."
"165399380-0-42369";"Please stand away. This area is for the royal family and their consorts alone."
"165399380-0-42395";"My brother was suppposed to meet me here well over an hour ago. I don't doubt he's still squandering his money in that damned gambling hall."
"165399380-0-42400";"We've got a good view of the island here, but our situation's less than ideal."
"165399380-0-42401";"Brilliant works from Breton masters left to crack and peel here in the desert sun. It's a travesty! I should have known these Crowns would fail to recognize their value."
"165399380-0-42410";"I'm drinking mead! Well, I'm pretending to drink mead. But it tastes pretty good.\n\nNow I'm eating fried guar. Yum!"
"165399380-0-42412";"I like having firm ground under my feet, but treebranches over my head would make things even better."
"165399380-0-42413";"The temple of the Crescent Moons has such a beautiful view of the island. If only this one came here under better circumstances."
"165399380-0-42415";"You're in a sorry state, friend. Head up the beach and rest."
"165399380-0-42421";"I never want to see another ship. I'll stay on this island for the rest of my life, if I have to! They can't force me to go back, can they?"
"165399380-0-42426";"What is it? Rasha finally figured out a way in? If not, let me rest."
"165399380-0-42427";"I hope you're here to help us get into that ruin. Rasha sure doesn't know the way in. I've sharpened my sword into a toothpick waiting."
"165399380-0-42429";"That Crown priest over there has been muttering to himself for hours. The only thing worse than a muttering Crown is a loud Crown."
"165399380-0-42430";"You want to talk to someone, talk to my sister, Rasha. She likes to talk."
"165399380-0-42431";"Crown priests are intolerable. Couldn't we have a moment's peace to bury our sacred dead before the hectoring begins?"
"165399380-0-42433";"The sword is the soul … without the sword I am lost."
"165399380-0-42446";"Fair winds, O wayfarer. You stand at the foot of Leki's Blade: swordsmen's most holy site. All who place their trust in the blade are welcome here."
"165399380-0-42448";"It's a relief to be here in the Hollow City, but I wonder if I'll ever see my home again."
"165399380-0-42455";"I went days without a sip of mead when we were in the Tower of Lies."
"165399380-0-42461";"I wouldn't go up there. The dead roam freely in Juras Fall."
"165399380-0-42464";"Weapons! Freshly imported from the mainland!"
"165399380-0-42465";"Exotic foods from the mainland! So fresh it's still damp!"
"165399380-0-42472";"I've entirely too many manifests to go over. I almost wish more boats had sunk. It would save me the paperwork."
"165399380-0-42474";"I've been here for hours. If I'd known that alit were on the contraband goods list, I'd never have brought them here."
"165399380-0-42475";"Getting out of the heat? You won't find a better place to duck work."
"165399380-0-42476";"These dune-dwellers are suspicious in the extreme. In the Alik'r sharp ears and noble bearings stand out, so we are watched constantly. That's just the price of doing business here."
"165399380-0-42478";"I hope you've got this zombie nonsense well in hand. Some of this inventory is perishable!"
"165399380-0-42479";"I can't wait to get back to Woodhearth. I've had enough goat meat, thank you very much."
"165399380-0-42480";"This lot stinks of Aldmeri treachery. When they make their move, I'll be ready."
"165399380-0-42481";"My wife … she didn't even like fishing, but I bullied her into it. I thought it would make for a fine afternoon. I'll never forgive myself."
"165399380-0-42508";"I was guarding this tree when the others were seeds in the wind."
"165399380-0-42511";"Hello again. I guess by now you've figured out that I'm not just a researcher."
"165399380-0-42514";"We've come upon a great deal of fresh meat and have decided to have a feast. You are welcome to stay."
"165399380-0-42519";"Hi there."
"165399380-0-42520";"What do you want? Good way to die, bothering me now."
"165399380-0-42521";"Do you come to worship? The temple is open to all who revere the moons, whether they be khajiit or not."
"165399380-0-42534";"Please, leave us to our training."
"165399380-0-42551";"Do not disturb the ritual, cub. Our harvest depends upon it."
"165399380-0-42565";"There's something strange going on here!"
"165399380-0-42576";"Let me guess—another new recruit. And you're here to fight for the Pact?"
"165399380-0-42577";"I long for quieter times, but I fear they will never come to Cyrodiil."
"165399380-0-42578";"Careful—this is a live firing range. Are you supposed to be here?"
"165399380-0-42579";"Another soldier to join the fight?"
"165399380-0-42580";"Repairs will take a while, but the Quay will recover in time."
"165399380-0-42582";"Pardon, wayfarer, but there is much work to be done and few hands to do it. Speak with Roshan, please."
"165399380-0-42584";"Nothing like the smell of a freshly oiled trebuchet, is there? Well, how can I help you?"
"165399380-0-42585";"This one is glad the Dominion was here. <<1>> could have died without your help."
"165399380-0-42586";"Escaping death at the hands of those savages gives me a thirst. Fortune favor you!"
"165399380-0-42587";"Y'ffre bless you, my friend! We're lucky you came along when you did.\n\nI broke open my personal reserve for this occasion. Nothing settles the nerves like a tankard from back home."
"165399380-0-42589";"Something strike your fancy? The sea bears strange fruit of late."
"165399380-0-42614";"You want words? Talk to <<1>>."
"165399380-0-42622";"Please, join the festivities! My sister, she dances! <<1>> plays music from distant lands! Even <<2>> plays a wonderful fool!\n\nWhen he stops drinking, anyway. Which is never."
"165399380-0-42626";"Bold bandits are not long for this world. Mark my words—they'll think twice before reaving along these shores again."
"165399380-0-42636";"Alik'ri forges are hotter than any in Tamriel—and the hottest steel births the keenest blades."
"165399380-0-42638";"Magics are not welcome here, wayfarer. The forge must be kept pure. If you practice the dark arts, have a care and do it outside."
"165399380-0-42656";"Tell no one, wayfarer, but I have always favored the bow. I only train here to please my father. Hopefully the Disciples will take note of my weakness and send me home."
"165399380-0-42669";"Maybe <<1>> is right, we have been lucky. Still, this one will rest more easily when word arrives from <<2>>."
"165399380-0-42670";"We were very lucky to survive this storm. Khenarthi smiles upon us, or perhaps we are just lucky. Either way, <<1>> is grateful."
"165399380-0-42687";"<The wooden ring Darius mentioned is not on this body.>"
"165399380-0-42714";"The storm, it brings strange fish, yes?"
"165399380-0-42715";"<<1>> fishes up an Elf! ""Throw it back!"" this one says, ""You cannot eat it. You cannot use it as bait. What good is an Elf?""\n\nWhat does he do? He keeps it! If it dies, <<2>> will never hear the end of it!"
"165399380-0-42716";"You are here to trade? Not to cause trouble? This one is sorry he must ask, but it pays to be careful, no?"
"165399380-0-42773";"<The wooden ring Darius mentioned is not on this body.>"
"165399380-0-42774";"<The wooden ring Darius mentioned is not on this body.>"
"165399380-0-42778";"Today you saved <<1>> from destruction. Khenarthi herself must watch over you."
"165399380-0-42779";"These totems seem to harness a combination of wind and spirit! I wonder if I can ….\n\nExcuse me. Do you mind?"
"165399380-0-42780";"You're slow, but you turned the tide of battle. <<1>> admits that counts for something."
"165399380-0-42782";"Think of the power the Maormer must command to control a creature like that. But the cost? It's simply too great."
"165399380-0-42783";"What the Maormer planned with that storm atronach was madness. Did they realize their own lives would end if they succeeded? If so, did they care?"
"165399380-0-42786";"You saved many of our brothers and sisters. Thank you for so bravely charging into battle."
"165399380-0-42788";"I ran out of Maormer to kill. If you find any more, let me know."
"165399380-0-42789";"The Prowler is headed to Auridon, and we're happy to ferry you there. When you're ready, hop in the launch. We'll set you up with your own bunk."
"165399380-0-42790";"<<1>> seems happy to join the Dominion now, but it won't last. I give it less than a year til they forget what happened here."
"165399380-0-42799";"<<1>> is gone, and I wasn't there to stop it. We may have won today, but why does it feel like I lost?"
"165399380-0-42802";"Don't mourn for <<1>>. You made sure her sacrifice had meaning.\n\nGods favor you, friend."
"165399380-0-42803";"We swept the shoreline. <<1>> captured some Maormer. <<A:2>> slaughtered the rest.\n\nYou fought well."
"165399380-0-42826";"The time has come. The Great Shackle must be destroyed."
"165399380-0-42832";"Your pardon, please. This one is too worried to speak with you at this time."
"165399380-0-42833";"No teeth marks on you, huh? Well, just wait!"
"165399380-0-42835";"I thought I would rot in that cage forever."
"165399380-0-42836";"Someone needs to pay for locking me away in this dung heap!"
"165399380-0-42855";"How did someone like you get an invite to the party?"
"165399380-0-42856";"I'll have a glass of wine."
"165399380-0-42906";"These days I have time to talk. What would you ask of this old warrior?"
"165399380-0-42919";"Come up for some fresh air? I've been sparring all day. The breeze up here is always so refreshing."
"165399380-0-42924";"Your purse looks heavy, wayfarer. Can we help safeguard your valuables?"
"165399380-0-42949";"I was beginning to think you wouldn't make it. I've already begun Aranias' story."
"165399380-0-42968";"You were a fine character. Most enjoyable. And it looks like you made quite an impression on Aranias."
"165399380-0-42973";"Thank the gods!"
"165399380-0-43027";"Dogs and … sons of dogs! Jackals and fiends! Swords aloft …! Come, brothers! Come and …."
"165399380-0-43064";"I am all right … just tired. Go and tend to the others."
"165399380-0-43076";"These green recruits need to be shown how a real soldier fights."
"165399380-0-43077";"This one'll be doing repairs 'til the big cat catches the little one!"
"165399380-0-43080";"Hope for no more bad weather, but this one's shoulder is acting up. There's another storm on its way!"
"165399380-0-43125";"Have you seen my ribcage? That milk drinking wizard scattered me across three of these piles."
"165399380-0-43130";"Do you hear the call of Sithis? It was drowned out by the wailing spirits, but now they're at rest."
"165399380-0-43132";"Where's the lieutenant? She was supposed to rendezvous with the landing party hours ago."
"165399380-0-43133";"Hey, you saved us from <<1>>! My brother and I didn't want to fight you earlier, but that wizard controlled our bodies. Or what's left of them! Ha!\n\nCome, dance with me in the fountain!"
"165399380-0-43142";"How do you fight the weather? I'd like to kill more of these Maormer, but I'll follow the sergeant's lead."
"165399380-0-43143";"The gods are certainly playing games with us today."
"165399380-0-43144";"Luck's been bad ever since we hit this damned beach."
"165399380-0-43150";"This appears to be the body of Zakavit. He appears to have been poisoned."
"165399380-0-43151";"I was beginning to think you wouldn't make it. I've already begun Aranias' story."
"165399380-0-43158";"Little Elf thought he could get away from Oblan. He was wrong."
"165399380-0-43159";"I'm afraid this one is about to die. I didn't realize how frail Bosmer were."
"165399380-0-43179";"You … you cut my bindings?\n\nYou're not one of them, are you? I can tell. Please, get me out of here!"
"165399380-0-43182";"I told the last of your cretins that I was more than adequate for the time being, thank you. I would appreciate some privacy."
"165399380-0-43185";"This residence is meant as a retreat for acolytes of Akatosh. Please don't disturb anything."
"165399380-0-43203";"Release me, or you're next!"
"165399380-0-43206";"Everyone here, from the newest acolyte to the abbess, partakes of the chores necessary to run the priory. It keeps us humble in Akatosh's sight."
"165399380-0-43215";"I'm looking for the rest of my squad. Have you seen them around the beaches?"
"165399380-0-43235";"We must be vigilant. Daedra can be as devious as dark clouds on a sunny day."
"165399380-0-43242";"Would you do a mate a favor? I'd wager a meat-walker like you would like to put your hands on some treasure that ain't cursed. I could arrange that."
"165399380-0-43248";"I hope Nelhilda and the others are safe in that Hollow City. \n\nA few people stayed here. If anyone finds there way here, at least they will find a friendly face."
"165399380-0-43259";"If you have come to search my remains for the gems I was accused of stealing, then you are both a coward and a fool.\n\nYou will not find the gems here, only the corpse of a good woman who did not deserve this dishonor."
"165399380-0-43260";"And thus, Longhaven is cleansed of the rank pollution of the undead.\n\nCherish victory, but do not let vigilance falter. We cannot fathom what evils lie undiscovered in this wild land."
"165399380-0-43276";"The jaws of the Dominion close upon Pelidil now. He will not escape this time."
"165399380-0-43342";"I don't believe we've met. I'd prefer to keep it that way."
"165399380-0-43343";"I remember you. You helped free us from the Everfull Flagon. Thanks for that."
"165399380-0-43345";"This place is great! They have the most delicious mead!"
"165399380-0-43347";"I still enjoy mead. Just not the enchanted kind. And not all the time."
"165399380-0-43349";"All this traveling has really taken it out of me. I'm so tired!"
"165399380-0-43350";"I like to come out here and just look at the trees. \n\nIt doesn't look anything like my memories of our lost home, but it is rather beautiful here."
"165399380-0-43351";"The hero of the Everfull Flagon! Nice to see you again, my friend."
"165399380-0-43352";"Well met, my friend. \n\nWe have met, haven't we? I confess, my memory isn't what it used to be."
"165399380-0-43353";"I couldn't do it."
"165399380-0-43359";"Should have listened to father. Should have gone to work for Hadran at the Caravan."
"165399380-0-43360";"Don't eat me! This one will taste terrible! Wait. You're not a troll! Thank Jode!"
"165399380-0-43361";"Feels good to be somewhere safe again. I don't know how much longer we would have survived out there.\n\nI'm just going to enjoy this quiet time for as long as it lasts."
"165399380-0-43362";"All this bickering becomes tiresome. While I agree we can't just leave our brothers and sisters out there, Darien's right. We need a plan."
"165399380-0-43363";"Everything we saw out there … it was maddening.\n\nThere's no way we can win this. There's just no way."
"165399380-0-43365";"I refuse to leave our guildmates to rot in the wilds of this wicked place! I don't care about the dangers.\n\nHow would you feel if it was you still out there? Wouldn't you want us to come find you?"
"165399380-0-43366";"My apologies for that display. The whole rash comment—just a figure of speech, of course.\n\nSo! I suppose you know more about this place than any of us? Like, where I can get a decent drink?"
"165399380-0-43368";"I do not expect this group to blindly trust me. That would be foolish.\n\nI plan to instill them with confidence so that when the others arrive they will follow me without question."
"165399380-0-43404";"Greetings, soldier. You stand in a holy place. The Elder Scrolls are a sacred charge of the Aldmeri Dominion. We must keep the scrolls from those who would defile or misuse them."
"165399380-0-43406";"The pieces begin to fall into place. With the King's aid, we shall assemble a force worthy of Meridia's blessing."
"165399380-0-43418";"I thought I heard something."
"165399380-0-43419";"It's just the wind. No one's there."
"165399380-0-43420";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-43421";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-43422";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-43423";"I heard something. I know I did."
"165399380-0-43425";"Show yourself!"
"165399380-0-43426";"What was that?"
"165399380-0-43432";"I'm glad Vanus made it. I was afraid we lost the old braggart.\n\nVanus and I go way back. I'm not sure we could continue this mission without him."
"165399380-0-43433";"We all knew we'd be fighting for our lives and the lives of the people of Nirn when we agreed to undertake this mission.\n\nI never expected anything different."
"165399380-0-43438";"I will take it from here, my friend. We have many things to do before we can assault the planar vortex.\n\nContinue to build our forces. I promise we won't march against Molag Bal without you."
"165399380-0-43490";"The air is heavy, like velvet in my throat. It is a wonder these blades do not rust before my eyes!"
"165399380-0-43495";"Welcome, friend. We need to discuss the preparations for the coming assault, but I wanted to wait until you arrived.\n\nDo you have any questions before we begin?"
"165399380-0-43496";"With the slightest amount of assistance from the Mages Guild, I have figured out how to cross the Chasm and reach the planar vortex. The effort, however, will require the work of our combined forces.\n\nKing Dynar will explain everything shortly."
"165399380-0-43497";"Look at this place! All fancy and formal. Everyone gathered, putting aside their differences to overcome a greater evil. How heroic! I expect this means that we're all going to die.\n\nHeroically, of course."
"165399380-0-43498";"Vanus has assured me that his plan will work. We just have to put aside our differences and work together."
"165399380-0-43499";"The Mages Guild and Fighters Guild, working together! I never thought I'd see the day!\n\nBut with you helping us, I'm sure that everything with turn out fine."
"165399380-0-43500";"It is time to have our revenge!"
"165399380-0-43502";"Let's make this quick. There're monsters out there that need killing."
"165399380-0-43503";"This is so exciting! My first council meeting! At least, my first that didn't involve Wood Elves and a dark forest."
"165399380-0-43504";"All that work and worry, and here we are, helping the Mages Guild! It's like a dream come true.\n\nI can't wait to delve into a few more of these Coldharbour dungeons!"
"165399380-0-43505";"The probability that any of us will survive this adventure, based on every calculation I could reference, is exceedingly infinitesimal.\n\nCould be worse, I suppose."
"165399380-0-43506";"I represent the people of Haj Uxith. My soldiers are your soldiers, as promised."
"165399380-0-43508";"Molag Bal will shiver in fear at our approach! He will feel the might of me and my sisters!"
"165399380-0-43510";"I'm curious to examine this plan that Vanus has come up with."
"165399380-0-43511";"If this one wasn't shaking in his fur at the thought of facing Molag Bal, I would find this gathering to be extremely fascinating!"
"165399380-0-43512";"Remember our deal. I help you, then you help me.\n\nEverything else is just so much sound and fury."
"165399380-0-43518";"I'm not strong enough. \n\nHe's going to kill the Wilderking."
"165399380-0-43541";"I didn't escape the fields with much, but you're welcome to take a look."
"165399380-0-43547";"Don't bring the war in here with you. I don't want to hear it. I served my time in the Covenant army, and I want nothing more to do with it."
"165399380-0-43551";"As soon as the cart is fixed, I shall return to my mother in Bergama. Crowns I can suffer, but never again do I want to see another beetle! Jahi offered a fat purse if I would stay here as cook, but I would rather sell everything and go."
"165399380-0-43552";"I don't feel safe leaving the house anymore. The war seems to be right outside our doors."
"165399380-0-43554";"Peace be upon you, wayfarer. Do you have a thirst that I can satisfy?"
"165399380-0-43555";"Welcome. Whatever Vlastarus has to offer is yours, for the right price."
"165399380-0-43563";"I'm rather busy right now. Come back later."
"165399380-0-43564";"Do not interrupt me!"
"165399380-0-43565";"<Raynor Vanos doesn't say a word.>"
"165399380-0-43574";"This ram doesn't want to move. The training grounds always get the worst equipment."
"165399380-0-43578";"I'm still a Shadowscale, sight or no sight. I protected <<1>> from the lamias, yes?"
"165399380-0-43591";"Everything is so beautiful here. I never thought I'd see anything like it.\n\nI think my people are starting to understand how important this decision really was. For all of us."
"165399380-0-43592";"Please, take care where you step. Whoever killed this man may have left something behind."
"165399380-0-43593";"Faraniel seems so at peace here in this city.\n\nMaybe she was right all along."
"165399380-0-43596";"We'd just put out for Haven when the storm hit. Our ship foundered on some rocks and we had to swim back to land.\n\nNow we wait for another vessel to hire us on."
"165399380-0-43597";"Fighting an opponent you know nothing about is like going into battle unarmed.\n\nStudy him first—what he wants, how he moves. If you can discover this, he is defeated before blades are drawn, yes?"
"165399380-0-43599";"Hush! This one is busy! Can you not feel the skooma flowing through the streets? If you cannot, listen! It is all around us!"
"165399380-0-43600";"I hope we made the right choice by coming here.\n\nBeing surrounded by all this though - it's so overwhelming."
"165399380-0-43601";"Well, I'll be. Who knew what we were missing out on all this time?"
"165399380-0-43602";"I have not seen this type of greenery before. It's fascinating."
"165399380-0-43615";"If Aranias does not receive help, she will die."
"165399380-0-43621";"I'm scared. Is it okay to be scared?\n\nLook at all of this! I've moved the land on my island… but. Tell me I can do this."
"165399380-0-43622";"There is… an island. There is an island out there. I can feel it reaching. I can almost touch it."
"165399380-0-43624";"We receive strange looks from your people. I expected nothing less. They still think we are monsters.\n\nWe will prove otherwise. We will show them the power of the lamias and how our aid will help win this battle."
"165399380-0-43630";"It isn't every day a bard comes to <<1>>! What better way to set aside our cares than by listening to songs of far off lands?"
"165399380-0-43631";"Isn't <<1>> wonderful? He's been to every port between here and <<2>>!"
"165399380-0-43632";"Anyone can sing. This one is here for news from afar!"
"165399380-0-43633";"<<1>> has come to <<2>>! We'll be drinking rotmeth to a spinner's yarns before the month is out!"
"165399380-0-43647";"Can I help you, or are you just going to stand there and stare?"
"165399380-0-43650";"It is my task to show the Imperial the sights of Alik'r."
"165399380-0-43653";"Leave me alone."
"165399380-0-43657";"This used to be a place of repose, of learning. Now … I don't know.\n\nIf my heart weighs this heavily, it is probably best if I leave this place."
"165399380-0-43669";"Your skill with siege weapons will make a difference in many battles. Learn to use them here."
"165399380-0-43674";"If you remember that gates are a keep's weak points, you know what tool to use to break in."
"165399380-0-43678";"Our caravan was set upon nearby while <<1>> and I were … occupied elsewhere. I suppose we are stuck until another travels through here."
"165399380-0-43685";"You don't plan to patronize this place, do you?\n\nNever mind. Forget I said anything."
"165399380-0-43688";"Walk softly, warrior. You are in the presence of great power."
"165399380-0-43692";"Some of those creatures are still out there, but we'll deal with them now that you've cut off the source."
"165399380-0-43694";"I heard you were the one that came to Longhaven's aid. I thank you, friend."
"165399380-0-43696";"I hope those filthy elves didn't raid my shop."
"165399380-0-43698";"If the beetles rush us, I will give my life to buy a few moments for the others to escape. \n\nMy son died in the fields, and I hold no fear in my heart at the thought that I might join him."
"165399380-0-43706";"Look, Barbas! A surprise mortal.\n\nI hope you aren't here to cause trouble for me."
"165399380-0-43714";"Into the portal, hurry!"
"165399380-0-43719";"Welcome to Willowgrove! Thanks for visiting!\n\nI'm sorry we don't have enough spare honeymead to offer you a sample. We're running a bit low at the moment."
"165399380-0-43720";"Oh! Come to sample our honey-mead?\n\nMy apologies, but we're running a little low at the moment. Hopefully things will be resolved soon and we should be overflowing again."
"165399380-0-43721";"Must a man watch his livelihood slip through his fingers like sand, and his friends take Tu'whacca's guidance to the Far Shores? It is almost more than I can bear."
"165399380-0-43722";"I … ain't got no bah-dee!"
"165399380-0-43740";"Careful, soldier. Siege weapons are dangerous to the unwary."
"165399380-0-43742";"I have played in these fields since I was a child! I will not simply walk away!"
"165399380-0-43744";"How can I help you, soldier?"
"165399380-0-43757";"Hail, warrior. Have you come to gaze upon the Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma?"
"165399380-0-43759";"I must ready these supplies. A thousand apologies."
"165399380-0-43762";"It is beyond my importance to speak with you. Best to seek out Jahi, at the house near the center of the field."
"165399380-0-43763";"I wonder what <<1>> intends for these Dominion fools. If he has any honor it will be nothing pleasant, mark my words!"
"165399380-0-43764";"It will be good to leave this forsaken rock! How do the cat men stand being so still all the time?"
"165399380-0-43765";"Comings and goings, records of supplies, dialogues between the Helmsreeve and the Aldmeri envoys, the paperwork never ends!\n\nA moment's rest! Is that so much to ask?"
"165399380-0-43766";"Had the Dominion simply sailed on by, it wouldn't have come to this. Whatever happens next is on their heads, not ours."
"165399380-0-43772";"This place is like the northern wastes of my homeland. The sky dominates the landscape.\n\nI could sit here and look at it for days."
"165399380-0-43817";"Brewing fermented liquids in this dry climate is much more difficult than working in my beloved swamp. But foul ale is better than no ale at all, I always say."
"165399380-0-43822";"Magic and magical tomes abound in this strange land!"
"165399380-0-43825";"The Fighters Guild is watching the situation here is Deshaan very closely."
"165399380-0-43856";"Even strangers are welcome at our table, though we have little to share."
"165399380-0-43864";"In the days of the Empire, rabble like the Black Daggers were hunted down and left to dangle from trees along the roadside."
"165399380-0-43872";"With the Empire gone, who protects people like us? No one, that's who!"
"165399380-0-43876";"The Dark Lord's vile scheme fails today."
"165399380-0-43879";"Though I live in squalor like the rest, I will not die here with them. Somewhere in Cyrodiil, there is a place unsullied by chaos and war. I will find it!"
"165399380-0-43883";"This one cannot find anything since fleeing the chaos in Hackdirt!"
"165399380-0-43890";"I cannot lose him too. Elethlin is all I have left, but I fear he will leave me soon."
"165399380-0-43891";"Perhaps this place is worthless enough that no one will bother us here. Who knew Hackdirt was of value to any but us?"
"165399380-0-43902";"Let Iirenir rest, please. She hasn't had a good sleep in weeks, not since those damned Black Daggers kicked us out of our home.\n\nI could use some sleep too, but I can't seem to relax."
"165399380-0-43916";"Now that I've got me sea-legs for this deck, so to speak, I think I'll navigate these waters just fine. \n\nMe and my new old friends."
"165399380-0-43918";"The war has been our undoing. You see us at the end of our days, treasures stolen and safety gone."
"165399380-0-43922";"Bird-people, unsavory sellswords, and dung in the streets. This Kozanset is a shaveskin paradise, yes? \n\nHa! Lucky for you, I sell many blades. Have a look."
"165399380-0-43924";"You look like a wise walker to Khunzum—not like these unclawed Redguards. They spit on this Baandari's goods and wares. \n\nBut you know better. You know quality. Only the best from Khunzum."
"165399380-0-43925";"Do you tire of wares that do not meet your impeccable standards? I see the woe on your face—you need not try to hide it. Look, then, at my sweet goods! I have spotless items from all across Tamriel!"
"165399380-0-43926";"I am thinking you need more bags. Easier to hide things, yes?"
"165399380-0-43927";"This one's wagon would not break if we did not stea— … if we did not buy so many heavy things!"
"165399380-0-43930";"Ah. Come in, come in, walker! You have traveled far to see this one, yes? \n\nI know; you seek something lost. Hanubina-ko may help you find it. This one sees through mist and stone to speak with the moons and stars."
"165399380-0-43937";"I don't know who sent you, but the answer is ""no."" I just want to be left alone. Please leave."
"165399380-0-43943";"Soreheels tried to cook the bird people, but their meat tastes dry and sour. The shaveskins do not want to buy it. They make strange faces and run away. Now what is this one to do with it?"
"165399380-0-43944";"Good ale loosens the tongue and also the purse strings, is it not so? \n\nI have some things you might like—old Khajiiti spices. Nothing illegal, mind you. At least it was not illegal when last I was in the khaj. You will take a look, yes?"
"165399380-0-43945";"Between Soreheel's lead bottom and Wheelbreaker's clumsy carpentry, we will never get the wagon out of this stinking village. \n\nI do not wish to stay here. I'm far too young and sleek for such a place."
"165399380-0-43949";"The only way to reach Molag Bal's planar vortex is to take control of the Chasm."
"165399380-0-43959";"Andrathel does a much better job at coating these bowls. I don't know who coated these, but the honey is caramelizing.\n\nWe don't have the spare honey to waste on bad batches of mead."
"165399380-0-43980";"Even the best chef can only do so much with inferior ingredients. But I am grateful for what Desh-Wazei and the other farmers provide. And I do make a delicious casserole surprise!"
"165399380-0-43981";"In my experience, a community's success depends in large part upon the quality of its brewmaster. And make no mistake. I am the best brewmaster you'll find in this Hist-forsaken realm."
"165399380-0-43982";"Visitors to our ancient city are a rare commodity. Almost as rare as some of the wares I sell. Let me show you what I have available this fine day."
"165399380-0-44009";"Icy water is the key to long life. First I work up a sweat, then I jump in the lake."
"165399380-0-44011";"Oljorn is crazy, but it's all I have for entertainment out here."
"165399380-0-44053";"It was truly unwise to let things get so out of hand."
"165399380-0-44065";"May those bastards' evil souls languish here for all eternity!\n\nNow we must only nullify the wrong they did to me in life. If you will take the gemstones back to Darius, he can present them to the authorities and prove my innocence."
"165399380-0-44083";"Never had I thought to hear an apology from such as she. Truly, I too am to blame for being too quick to fight."
"165399380-0-44090";"With you here, maybe I don't need to worry so much about getting my ship back from these cursed Sea Elves."
"165399380-0-44093";"Pelidil will pay for what they did to Asteril. They will all pay."
"165399380-0-44094";"I never thanked you for helping us back in Woodhearth. Asteril was my friend, and because of you we can catch the ones that did this to her."
"165399380-0-44097";"Well met, Queenseye. Grim work to be done here, and we're glad to have you with us."
"165399380-0-44100";"Those bastards. If they hadn't outnumbered me …."
"165399380-0-44101";"<The harpy doesn't seem to be afraid or aggressive.>"
"165399380-0-44115";"Fancy a drink? All the finest libations in Tamriel, here. All the worst, as well."
"165399380-0-44117";"Those Maormer pirates came from the water. They're all over <<1>>!"
"165399380-0-44121";"We can't let those Maormer pirates reach <<1>>. They'll butcher our families!"
"165399380-0-44124";"What are you doing here?\n\nDoesn't matter. If you're in the mood to cave in some Sea Viper skulls, I don't really care."
"165399380-0-44125";"Why, it's you. We do seem to meet in the strangest places."
"165399380-0-44126";"Not one Sea Viper will make it through this door."
"165399380-0-44129";"<This Wood Orc's neck was snapped with incredible force. A blood trail leads off the edge of the cliff, and huge claw marks are gouged in the rock. It appears something tumbled off.>"
"165399380-0-44163";"Let me work on this barrier, you help stop the daedra coming through the portals!"
"165399380-0-44169";"I think our friends have the Chasm well in hand. What say we pop in for a chat with Molag Grunda?"
"165399380-0-44232";"These mages are crazy. Fearless, but crazy. The little wood elf says she can get this barrier down. I'll just make sure no one attacks her in the meantime."
"165399380-0-44256";"Hey.\n\nSquad got separated. <<1>> and I found <<2>>. They hurt him bad."
"165399380-0-44263";"We're not safe. Not yet."
"165399380-0-44267";"<The marine <<1>> is dead.>"
"165399380-0-44268";"A ringing head is bad.\n\nBut when it remains somewhat head-shaped … that is good, yes?"
"165399380-0-44275";"At last, a messenger! Welcome, oh winged deliverer. What does my prince have to say to me, after all these years?"
"165399380-0-44279";"What are you doing here? Get away, this is my place!"
"165399380-0-44280";"Greetings! This magical projection presents my current plan to my allies. Separated and alone, I decided to complete our mission. Personally.\n\nI entered the Black Forge through a side door with the intention of destroying the Great Shackle beyond."
"165399380-0-44286";"Oh, it's just you. What a relief! I hate guard duty. Especially portal guard duty. You never know what's going to pop out and kill you where you stand."
"165399380-0-44308";"My friend! To escape death so triumphantly is constant thrill, yes?\n\nNot so thrilling for the Maormer, of course."
"165399380-0-44313";"Move on, fetcher."
"165399380-0-44319";"You must be here to work with that matchmaker lug. If so, the boss says I can't touch you. \n\nWhich is a shame, because some of that stuff you're wearing looks pricey."
"165399380-0-44321";"""No robbery, extortion, or drunken revelry until after the wedding.""\n\nBloody Wildur and his blasted daughter. What are we supposed to do, eh? Are we the Ungodly, or ain't we? Pooey."
"165399380-0-44322";"Let me be clear: I don't like you, and I don't like your smarmy friend inside the tent. \n\nStay out of my way, lest you want me to show you the color of your guts."
"165399380-0-44344";"Vanus is amazing with his portal placement. Conjuration has never been a strength of mine."
"165399380-0-44378";"My name is Halelah, and I have a gift for you."
"165399380-0-44379";"It's finished. My masterpiece. What do you think? Be honest now."
"165399380-0-44392";"I greet you, walker. Study my wares; there is sure to be something to your liking."
"165399380-0-44393";"Please buy from Airal. He refuses to move until all his wares are sold. This one tires of the cold and his sullen company."
"165399380-0-44410";"Do you honestly believe that this collection of misguided mistfits can actually challenge the Lord of Brutality?\n\nI take it back. You are as stupid as you are brave!"
"165399380-0-44411";"Ah, darling! Perhaps you could say something to your companions? They refuse to let me participate in their little council.\n\nThe Ayleid actually told me to shut up and be quiet! How terribly droll of the man."
"165399380-0-44412";"I wish that Zur were here. He would have been shaking in his fur at the thought of going up against Molag Bal, but he also appreciated a good council meeting."
"165399380-0-44423";"Lord Sanguine has decreed a revel! Talk to Skeewul and join us!"
"165399380-0-44431";"Lord Sanguine provides needed relief in dire times like this. Do you wish to participate? I have a special drink, brewed just for this occasion!"
"165399380-0-44434";"The world is going to Oblivion, so we might as well enjoy life while we can. Talk to Skeewul if you want to join in!"
"165399380-0-44437";"There are no unhappy folk at Lord Sanguine's revels. The war, those alliances, the Empire—none of that matters anymore.\n\nJoin us, talk to Skeewul!"
"165399380-0-44440";"Feel free to look, but don't touch the prisoners. Sylvian wants them alive, for now."
"165399380-0-44460";"My father would be very proud of us, I think. \n\nYou have ensured that the honor of the Ash'abah will abide. I am grateful that I can count you as one of our tribe."
"165399380-0-44463";"To know that young girl masquerading as a scholar's apprentice was actually one of the most dangerous necromancers in the Alik'r Desert …?\n\nI still cannot understand it."
"165399380-0-44464";"I still feel like such a fool. To have shared my knowledge with that evil girl, and the whole time ….\n\nI am very grateful that she is no longer a threat. If things had not turned out this way, I don't know if I could've forgiven myself."
"165399380-0-44465";"Look at you. First you drive the risen dead from the Sentinel docks, and then you drive them from all of Alik'r.\n\nI must confess. I am impressed."
"165399380-0-44467";"When I think back to when this all started, when the Withered Hand had captured me and was holding me beneath the city … I can't believe how far we've come.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but we defeated the Withered Hand. We're heroes now!"
"165399380-0-44478";"This is our spot. You're welcome to sit by the fire for a time, but you'll need to make your own camp, if you're staying."
"165399380-0-44479";"I hope the fish keep biting. We'll be here a while."
"165399380-0-44480";"This camp is primitive, but at least we're alive and out of harm's way, for the time being."
"165399380-0-44481";"I can't believe they dragged me out into the middle of nowhere. It's cold and wet and all my books are ruined!"
"165399380-0-44485";"She killed them all. Froze them solid. How am I supposed to defeat that? I had to run, right? I had to hide or I'd be killed too!"
"165399380-0-44490";"Watch it, stranger. <<1>> put me here to keep an eye on his daughter's dowry."
"165399380-0-44502";"Hold. In the name of the Dominion."
"165399380-0-44532";"The city has been empty for so long. It's good to finally see a new customer in here."
"165399380-0-44533";"Welcome to the Shining Star, my friend! You won't find a more warm and inviting place in all of Coldharbour!"
"165399380-0-44534";"Welcome, friend. I come from a long line of master brewers, and I guarantee that my beverages are the best you'll ever drink in this horrid land."
"165399380-0-44535";"If you're looking for something to eat, just give me a moment. I'm not used to these crowds."
"165399380-0-44536";"I represent the Fighters Guild here in the Hollow City."
"165399380-0-44537";"My job is to establish the Mages Guild hall here in the Hollow City."
"165399380-0-44538";"I'm almost sorry to be stuck inside these walls. I'd love to get out there and get into the thick of the battle!"
"165399380-0-44539";"A secure vault makes for a confident heart."
"165399380-0-44544";"To see everything so alive and full of energy pleases me greatly. It is a stark contrast to the world outside these walls.\n\nIt reminds me of my time in Glenumbra, when things were … better."
"165399380-0-44545";"This city is dreadful. All the bright colors. The blooming flowers and trees. The … life!\n\nMaybe I should go back outside again. I think I prefer Coldharbour's stark landscape to this … wonderland."
"165399380-0-44547";"Finally, I can just relax in a nice, warm room. A glass of fine wine in my hand.\n\nI think I'll draw a nice hot bath to soothe my weary body. I just wish I had a servant or two to deal with these mundane tasks."
"165399380-0-44550";"Hungry? Of course you are. C'mon over and let Firuin take care of you."
"165399380-0-44559";"The wonders of war never cease. Every ram that shatters against a keep door, every trebuchet set afire, it's all coin in my pocket. Hurray for war, I say!"
"165399380-0-44561";"Aetis drives us like he fears the war will end tomorrow. Can't come soon enough for me."
"165399380-0-44563";"Last load of logs broke our wagon wheels. Now Aetis says we have to cut them all in half."
"165399380-0-44572";"Sorry, no time to talk. Vanus is running me ragged."
"165399380-0-44573";"You'll want to talk to Vanus. I'm just his assistant."
"165399380-0-44625";"Valenwood just keeps getting stranger and stranger. I might have to change my route entirely."
"165399380-0-44632";"People call this one a coward for not fighting. Ziss on them. Getting drunk when things turn dangerous takes real courage!"
"165399380-0-44647";"Just policing up the last of these damned Imperials. Most scattered like bloodflies when we threw down our sheathes. Cowards all."
"165399380-0-44664";"These claws are only good for one thing—slashing prices!"
"165399380-0-44681";"My head feels as if a dozen Orcs are pounding on war drums inside my skull."
"165399380-0-44682";"I am proud to lend my magic to such great personages as you and Vanus Galerion."
"165399380-0-44683";"Just give the word and my hammer will be by your side!"
"165399380-0-44711";"Greetings. I guard this Transitus Shrine for the Dominion. Do you have questions for me?"
"165399380-0-44713";"<This Bosmer was tortured to death. There is nothing left to be done.>"
"165399380-0-44736";"I hate this place. I miss the warmth and golden glow of Alik'r."
"165399380-0-44741";"Greetings, soldier."
"165399380-0-44744";"Don't leave me here!"
"165399380-0-44745";"Please … help me!"
"165399380-0-44759";"I came along with the original force. I wanted to show my support for this important effort."
"165399380-0-44760";"What a dismal land this is! Why don't they ever send me somewhere nice?"
"165399380-0-44761";"It's like stepping into the past. We're walking around in a piece of history! Look at the architecture!"
"165399380-0-44762";"I find it rather inspiring to see the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild working together. It gives me hope for the future."
"165399380-0-44763";"I fear for the mages still lost in the wilds of Coldharbour. I do hope we find them all before too much time has passed."
"165399380-0-44764";"We need to gather our forces and end this! If we stand back and do nothing, the Planemeld will destroy our world."
"165399380-0-44765";"If you're thinking of venturing outside the city, you'll need the toughest armor you can afford. Lucky for you, I have exactly what you need."
"165399380-0-44766";"It's hard maintaining stock in a place like this. Especially with such a high demand. But I'll show you what I've got."
"165399380-0-44767";"I wasn't sure what it would be like when I got here, but it isn't too bad. I might even be able to turn a profit!"
"165399380-0-44768";"As soon as I can take a break, there's so much I want to search and explore!"
"165399380-0-44769";"Irrki's heart beats with a thousand sorrows! But if you wish to purchase a sword, this one will show you what she has."
"165399380-0-44772";"What a spectacular day! I almost feel like singing!"
"165399380-0-44773";"Despite the lack of ingredients I'm used to dealing with, this desolate place isn't half bad."
"165399380-0-44774";"Enchanting requires concentration and precision, but I'm just not feeling like myself today."
"165399380-0-44775";"My forge is your forge, friend."
"165399380-0-44776";"If you need something, step right up! My work is in high demand right now. High demand."
"165399380-0-44777";"I left my family back in Windhelm to come here. I hope I don't live to regret it."
"165399380-0-44778";"This ancient city is pretty impressive."
"165399380-0-44785";"You… You're the one from the mine. Leave me alone! \n\nIsn't it bad enough to see me this way?"
"165399380-0-44802";"Hmm. This one smells wood smoke. You should wet your throat before you go. Easier to breathe with some sugar on the tongue, yes?"
"165399380-0-44808";"Greetings, walker. As events have turned from foul to fragrant, it falls upon Manabi to see to the blessings of this temple. She must see to this thing, but may the moons ever light your path."
"165399380-0-44811";"This one's task is to render our temples sleek and fragrant once more, as should be any Temple of the Two-Moons Dance.  It would be too much to ask for the invaders of Dune to have been tidy about it, yes? This one thought as much."
"165399380-0-44818";"Valenwood is a trove of rare ingredients."
"165399380-0-44819";"The forest is rich with spiritual energy, so be careful. It makes the gems … anxious."
"165399380-0-44820";"The Elf Queen demands garments, demands leathers—demands, demands, demands! But isn't that just the way of the world?"
"165399380-0-44821";"Welcome to Marbruk. Jewel of Valenwood. A good place to spend some coin!"
"165399380-0-44822";"Most Altmer wouldn't trust a Wood Elf with their money. Fair enough, but trust is the Dominion's foundation, is it not? We have to start somewhere."
"165399380-0-44826";"The best woodcraft is both strong and flexible. Just like me, yes? Ha!"
"165399380-0-44827";"Mead from meat, wine from grapes … by the end of the night it all tastes the same."
"165399380-0-44828";"What? You think an Orc doesn't know his spices? That he can't please the delicate Altmer palate? Pah. Then you haven't tried my cooking."
"165399380-0-44829";"If one more Bosmer tells me that he's ""enchanted to meet me"" I'm moving back to Summerset."
"165399380-0-44830";"Equipment is at a premium in Valenwood, but I've orders to see guild members supplied."
"165399380-0-44831";"I'm the hall steward."
"165399380-0-44833";"A fine day for fine goods, no?"
"165399380-0-44834";"War brings high demand for armor, but it makes metal costly, especially in Valenwood. The Bosmer rely on imports."
"165399380-0-44835";"The finest silks, the finest thread, the beauty of Nirn woven into a robe."
"165399380-0-44839";"This is a good place to have one's mind opened. The magic runs deep here, and there is much more quiet."
"165399380-0-44840";"Keep an eye peeled; this wood is full of the remnants of the Ayleid civilization."
"165399380-0-44841";"The law of meat, hide, and bone obligates us to use every fleshy thing in the air, on the earth, and beneath the sea. Hence the superiority of Bosmer leathercraft."
"165399380-0-44842";"Normally, I'd say these woods are no place for riding, but these are no ordinary woods. Seems like the beasts know their way better than I do, sometimes."
"165399380-0-44843";"It is not the horse that makes the mount, but the master. Take care of your animal and your animal will take care of you."
"165399380-0-44845";"Lay aside ancient enmities, or take up arms and make me rich. I'm not particular."
"165399380-0-44846";"Sometimes claws do not suffice. Sometimes only the skill of the able craftsman will do."
"165399380-0-44855";"You strike an imposing figure, friend. And you look like you might not be shy about using it to make a little coin, yes? I've got a little problem, and I think the answer just stepped onto this balcony."
"165399380-0-44856";"Careful. Sure, you look like you can handle yourself, but this place is full of unscrupulous rats. \n\nEspecially Angore. Bastard thinks he can get away with ripping me off. Say, you interested in helping me settle accounts? For pay, of course."
"165399380-0-44862";"I'm quite busy at the moment, sorry. I'll be lucky if this haul allows me to keep myself fed, much less pay off my debts. Please leave me to my work."
"165399380-0-44864";"Do you know how to read?"
"165399380-0-44875";"Go away."
"165399380-0-44876";"Something is very wrong here."
"165399380-0-44878";"What captains are going to come out here to trade when there are magical hurricanes destroying entire fleets?"
"165399380-0-44879";"Test stuff"
"165399380-0-44895";"We meet again, fellow knight! Wonderful day to sally forth, wouldn't you say?"
"165399380-0-44897";"You can go in, if you want. This one knows you drove the muskarse mage out of our inn, after all!\n\nBut this one must have you know the inn is closed for now. It is unsleek and foul-smelling, unfit for visitors."
"165399380-0-44899";"What luck that someone came along. Don't worry about me. My companions need help!"
"165399380-0-44903";"Don't mind <<1>>. We're together again, and it's all thanks to you."
"165399380-0-44906";"I've been waiting forever to spend time with my darling. A little privacy?"
"165399380-0-44907";"Red-Ears hears you, walker. Though his mate and he are very grateful for your assistance, the inn remains closed for now.\n\nUntil I wash, and I wash, and the filth and soot alll scrub away. Then and only then may Dune's inns accept visitors."
"165399380-0-44912";"Not going to make the same mistake this time. I've got a system."
"165399380-0-44913";"What is this? Who are you?"
"165399380-0-44914";"You're not with them, are you? Help me!"
"165399380-0-44915";"You fight well. I don't suppose you're here for us?"
"165399380-0-44916";"Daedra apparently don't have a big interest in looting. My goods are completely fine, even after all the chaos! And a good thing, too! With all of the destruction in the Merchant's District, people are going to need me.\n\nDo you need anything?"
"165399380-0-44917";"You get what you deserve. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nStrength. Strength and steel, these are the only things that matter."
"165399380-0-44918";"Leave me be, sera. I am considering the homilies of blessed Almalexia as I hone my body.\n\nThe next s'wit to cross blades with me will surely be passed under the axe, mark my words."
"165399380-0-44919";"Zur hates standing in the green goo. No amount of licking gets it out of one's fur."
"165399380-0-44931";"Whatever it is you want from me, make it quick.\n\nWith Dune having so recently been subject to a Daedric incursion, I don't exactly have much time to deal with you."
"165399380-0-44934";"Hmm? Oh, excuse me. I lost a bit of time for my studies with the Daedra and all.\n\nIt's imperative I show my family I deserve to leave this dump and return to Auridon. So, I hone my magics constantly. I'm sure you'll understand, I am, thus, busy."
"165399380-0-44936";"Many of us will be remaining here, to fill in for those guards of Dune who died in its defense. Just between you and me, I'd rather be on the front, but orders are orders."
"165399380-0-44946";"It's pretty from here, isn't it, Aleswell? Majestic even. Up close, inside, it's very different. I prefer the view from here."
"165399380-0-44949";"Banking is an unfamiliar art, deep in Valenwood. But I am an eager student."
"165399380-0-44961";"Fortunately, we didn't get hit as hard as most. We won't be able to take another storm like that though."
"165399380-0-44963";"I have roamed this land since before many of these trees were seeds. In that time I have wanted to know how I came to be. \n\nYet here you stand with the answer and I hestitate, uncertain."
"165399380-0-44994";"The water flows once more! Our souls are no longer bound by <<1>>'s magic."
"165399380-0-45000";"Spare a coin for a veteran's meal?"
"165399380-0-45017";"Now that the storm's over, everyone here is really just trying to pick up the pieces. If you are looking for work or trade, I'd recommend Mistral. They didn't get hit as hard as the rest of us."
"165399380-0-45027";"Do you see how strong these ants are? They can carry a dead bug three times their size!"
"165399380-0-45031";"Kamu crossed the Chasm, with most-fragrant companions by his side! \n\nThis one grieves for the friends we lost today, however, and for the losses yet to come."
"165399380-0-45038";"Animal husbandry; one of the few jobs here that doesn't violate the Green Pact. But Marbruk's where the money is."
"165399380-0-45039";"Just the person I was looking for. King Dynar is rallying our forces near the Reaver Citadel."
"165399380-0-45054";"I shouldn't be able to see you. It looks like the Mourning Stone brought the spirits out in the temple courtyard. Can you hear me?"
"165399380-0-45064";"Cadwell takes some getting used to, I must admit, but he really is an amazing fellow. He ….\n\nWait a moment! What happened? Where's the rest of your team?"
"165399380-0-45107";"Many outsiders who visit Bramblebreach are weary. They carry weapons and have seen much violence.\n\nIf you are one of them, please stay a while. Relax. Daydream a little."
"165399380-0-45108";"The spirits told me another outsider has come to visit Bramblebreach."
"165399380-0-45109";"Don't mind Uunril. Welcome to our home."
"165399380-0-45110";"Does everyone break into each other's houses where you come from?"
"165399380-0-45113";"Welcome to Bramblebreach."
"165399380-0-45115";"Shh. Don't tell Galesse my hiding place."
"165399380-0-45116";"I can't tell if it's laughing … but I think it is."
"165399380-0-45128";"You look like a confident person. I wish I was confident."
"165399380-0-45130";"You scared them away! I almost had one."
"165399380-0-45132";"My poor brother Thragaer. He's really looking for them."
"165399380-0-45136";"I thought the battle behind us was dreadful, but this place … it boggles the mind!\n\nStill, we've made it this far. Victory is within our grasp, especially now that the Radiant Lady stands with us."
"165399380-0-45137";"Meridia and Molag Bal have always hated each other with a fiery passion, but that hatred has cost so many of our lives.\n\nI have a notion to show them both why Vanus Galerion's power should be feared!"
"165399380-0-45138";"Most people dream of lusty Argonians or delectable dishes. But not old Darien. Oh, no—I dream about planar vortexes and blinding lights of Meridia! How is that possible?\n\nAnd why do I keep asking questions that no one can answer?"
"165399380-0-45139";"I've seen so many things in my life. This though, I could've never imagined something as big as this.\n\nThere have been far too many people who have given up their lives so we could stand here. We have to ensure they did not die in vain."
"165399380-0-45141";"If only we could have known about … all of this. If we'd have known about this before everything happened. Maybe my people could have stopped it.\n\nOr maybe it's just wishful thinking."
"165399380-0-45147";"Quickly, untie me! They could be back at any moment!"
"165399380-0-45170";"<Examine the corpse.>"
"165399380-0-45174";"You're welcome to share my fire. Or is there something else you need?"
"165399380-0-45175";"They say the war will affect us all. That we should all care about what is happening. Well, I do! Nord mead is so much easier to come by when Dominion soldiers are raiding supply caravans in Cyrodiil. I like the softer stuff."
"165399380-0-45176";"I like these little guys, but I can't help wondering how they might taste."
"165399380-0-45179";"I came here after hearing rumors of vampires and some kind of magical cursed skull. It all sounded quite interesting. That is, until I heard some hero went and destroyed it for the sake of the village."
"165399380-0-45180";"Come and have a look! Any traveler can benefit from Shajamah-ja's finely stitched goods."
"165399380-0-45181";"These are dangerous times. Don't leave unprepared."
"165399380-0-45183";"Fada thought merchant life wouldn't be so bad. Certainly safer than picking pockets. But, you know, this one sometimes misses the thrill of the hunt."
"165399380-0-45187";"We heard a lot of the merchants left Longhaven, so we decided to try our luck here. Even if the claims that the place is cursed turn out to be true, it can't be any worse than dealing with Bashshi-ra in Woodhearth."
"165399380-0-45200";"Nirnroot wine. This one sings its praises!"
"165399380-0-45203";"I'm just passing through to resupply before I head out to hunt for more Dark Anchors. Everyone has their share of problems, but none of it will matter either way if we don't destroy those Anchors."
"165399380-0-45207";"Oh, it's you again! I heard a rumor that you ended up saving Longhaven. Maybe I'll return there one of these days and take up hunting again."
"165399380-0-45224";"I'd planned this painting as a gift to Queen Ayrenn, if only people would stop getting in the way."
"165399380-0-45233";"The Dominion is looking for more able-bodied fighters. I think I'll answer the call."
"165399380-0-45239";"I can't believe the Thane tricked us like that. And he hurt Bernt! If the Thane shows his face in here again, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!"
"165399380-0-45240";"That so-called Thane threatened me for tampering with the casks. \n\nMy father pushed him away from me and that dreadful … creature … he knocked my father down. I was afraid he might kill him."
"165399380-0-45242";"Damned bloodfiend took a piece out of my arm."
"165399380-0-45247";"When you hunt lizards on the sands, you must know their favorite basking spots.\n\nI make sure the softest and warmest pits are clear of debris. Then, the lizards come to me."
"165399380-0-45248";"Crime is the brother of civilization, I suppose."
"165399380-0-45389";"It's almost like that girl doesn't realize how ridiculous she looks flouncing about like that."
"165399380-0-45391";"You look bored. C'mon over and have a drink!"
"165399380-0-45395";"This passage leads to an old sanctuary built by the first Altmer to travel to Valenwood. It is now in the hands of the Maormer, but the rightful rulers will soon reclaim it. I suggest avoiding the place until then. The Maormer protect it fiercely."
"165399380-0-45396";"This is my favorite fishing hole. I'm glad the Altmer left it alone, even though the guards give me grief when I try to visit."
"165399380-0-45412";"Have you seen my husband, Cassirion? If he's ogling that Bosmer dancer again … and on top of that the Green Artisan stole my wedding gift!"
"165399380-0-45420";"I have to travel to Marbruk every day for work. It is a long walk, but Shalirr has many mouths to feed."
"165399380-0-45421";"Come to use this Transitus Shrine? A wise choice. Do you have questions?"
"165399380-0-45423";"O, I beseech you! Let none of them remain safe from your blade, let your righteous wrath flow through them and leave not a scrap behind … and let my family be yet alive…."
"165399380-0-45424";"It is all gone … everything and everyone … just gone, in the blink of an eye!"
"165399380-0-45457";"Every able-bodied soul is needed to oppose our enemies. We will either bury old divisions, or bury our families."
"165399380-0-45464";"Stand back, vile beast, lest I slay you in no uncertain terms!\n\nOh, it's you. Taking a stroll, then? Enjoying the beautiful countryside?"
"165399380-0-45465";"Welcome to our humble guildhouse.\nThe presence of the Thalmor in Woodhearth has been a mixed blessing for us.\nI fear you'll find the bureaucracy as vast as our collection of rare knowledge."
"165399380-0-45466";"Arkay preserve me, I thought you were one of them for a moment!"
"165399380-0-45469";"The horses were screaming and something hit me … I feared I would die here."
"165399380-0-45470";"My husband Calastil hasn't left his bed since his favorite dog Pluck was stolen by the Green Artisan. I'm worried for his health."
"165399380-0-45475";"You are always welcome here, warrior."
"165399380-0-45486";"My heraldic cane was stolen by the Green Artisan! I can't show my face in court without it. How humiliating!"
"165399380-0-45487";"I'm sleeping."
"165399380-0-45490";"Don't bother Lowindor, he's pretending to be asleep."
"165399380-0-45491";"An Altmer researcher from Summerset told me the Bosmer here worship a god they call the Wilderking. She is determined to search for this Wilderking in that treacherous forest, discover if he is real, and if he is in fact a god.\n\nSuch a brave girl."
"165399380-0-45492";"Go away."
"165399380-0-45508";"Truly it is a beautiful place now that the stains are washing away and the rightful owners have reclaimed this place. Oh, I wish Asteril could see it. Perhaps she is looking down on me now."
"165399380-0-45509";"Not a bad haul. Good condition, too. We can use these to resupply our soldiers."
"165399380-0-45510";"I've kept the forge running hot if you need to use it. Retaking this place isn't without its benefits for the Dominion."
"165399380-0-45511";"Looking for supplies?"
"165399380-0-45512";"The battle made this one a bit hungry. Let's cook up something nice, yes?"
"165399380-0-45513";"Hard-fought and well won. You're making quite a name for yourself you know."
"165399380-0-45514";"It's surprising how many of our own supplies and armaments the Maormer managed to take from us on their raids. But you've seen to it that they're back in our hands. Well done."
"165399380-0-45520";"It feels good just to be able to sit by a warm fire and read again. It's been too long, really.\n\nIf anything, it's a nice distraction. Takes my mind off everything that went on back at the cliffs."
"165399380-0-45535";"Thank you for not giving up on me back at the cliffs even though I had already given up on myself.\n\nI was so close to just stepping off that edge …."
"165399380-0-45536";"This one apologized for stabbing Juline. She … didn't seem to accept it, though. This one thinks she's going to need time to forgive Mim.\n\nMim hope she knows that what Mim did was for her own good. To save her. Sounds strange, even to Mim, yes?"
"165399380-0-45537";"Fariel wants me to remain here for a time as her representative. Holding the sanctuary could greatly strengthen the military might of Woodhearth. We've driven the Maormer out, but they won't stop the raids. They never do."
"165399380-0-45551";"Marbruk gardens are beautiful, yes?\n\nAzurdat planted these. Of course they are beautiful."
"165399380-0-45558";"Best get back to Shrouded Vale before it's too late."
"165399380-0-45561";"Make your selection quickly. This potion requires my utmost concentration."
"165399380-0-45562";"You want my services? Fine. It seems any fool is allowed to meddle in the arcane these days."
"165399380-0-45600";"An outsider! Don't tell me anything about the world. I want to see it for myself."
"165399380-0-45601";"Hello, I hope you are enjoying our village."
"165399380-0-45608";"Compared to other Bosmer settlements, Woodhearth is downright civilized. At least, they don't constantly try to steal your tools here."
"165399380-0-45612";"I traveled Tamriel studying the art of weaponsmithing. And then war brought me back to Woodhearth."
"165399380-0-45613";"Treethane Fariel herself commissioned one of my blades. I was humbled, truly humbled."
"165399380-0-45616";"Greetings, warrior. I guard this Transitus Shrine for the Covenant. Do you have questions for me?"
"165399380-0-45617";"So much soil to till for the planting, so little time."
"165399380-0-45618";"Bosmer brew is poison. Mead from the guts of insects. Blech."
"165399380-0-45621";"This one sells a wide variety of meats and also plants for those of delicate digestion."
"165399380-0-45641";"You are always welcome here, warrior."
"165399380-0-45646";"A hunter's weapon is no mere tool. It's an extension of himself."
"165399380-0-45653";"It's imperative that I be left to catalog our supplies. Leave me to it, if you don't mind."
"165399380-0-45675";"Eee! Eee!"
"165399380-0-45686";"We're going to scare our friend Khalima. She loves it when we scare her. Once she stops chasing us she laughs. \n\nI haven't seen her laugh … but I'm sure she does. She loves us!"
"165399380-0-45688";"Aha. A guest! How wonderful!\n\nI wonder, would you help my friend and I with a little experiment?"
"165399380-0-45695";"See? <<1>> has more sense in him than half the Albatross crew.\n\nHe never did like <<2>>. Next time, I'll trust the monkey."
"165399380-0-45701";"Found the old Everfull Flagon, eh? Interesting place, the Flagon. Glad someone's finally got it sorted out. Good show!"
"165399380-0-45704";"If the fight reaches these walls, I plan to be ready."
"165399380-0-45705";"I'm a merchant by trade, but a warrior at heart."
"165399380-0-45706";"Even for a well-traveled denizen of the planes such as myself, this place is way beyond my comfort level. I fear it won't get any easier from here on in."
"165399380-0-45707";"There's no time to rest. We have to keep moving. I'll make sure our flank is protected while you clear the way ahead."
"165399380-0-45709";"I prefer to fight from a distance. The longer the better. So I'm quite content to hold up in this city for the duration of this engagement."
"165399380-0-45714";"Look at this! I'm actually sweating! I can't remember the last time I performed this much physical exertion.\n\nThis better be worth it. Usually Kireth deals with these things while I deal with the research and planning."
"165399380-0-45723";"Come to buy some of my astonishing Nirnroot wine? Well, I hate to break your heart but I'm all out."
"165399380-0-45725";"I greet you, wayfarer. Doubtless you have come for my renowned Nirnroot wine. I grieve to say that I have no more at present."
"165399380-0-45755";"Zur does not like this place. It has everything this one despises—great heights, impenetrable darkness, deadly opponents …. But it also has things that fascinate this one.\n\nZur is so conflicted!"
"165399380-0-45811";"I don't care for this job, I'm just here for the free food."
"165399380-0-45814";"Ignore my brother, we're professionals. Laurosse isn't paying us enough to fight Orc warbands. Much less haul this cooking bowl around."
"165399380-0-45818";"Laurosse is so cute when he's fumbling with life skills."
"165399380-0-45833";"That was a close call. Thanks for helping me in there.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm really starting to dislike Daedric death traps."
"165399380-0-45842";"The planar vortex is destroyed. Molag Bal's Planemeld is at an end."
"165399380-0-45846";"My time has finally come it seems. I have … I have lived far longer than any of my people.\n\nFinally … I will … I will be able to join them once more."
"165399380-0-45848";"I fear the King's wounds are too extensive for us to heal.\n\nHe … he doesn't have much time left."
"165399380-0-45934";"Do not fear. This one won't jump.\n\nBut the thought has occurred."
"165399380-0-46003";"Talk to Maelen. He makes the deals around here."
"165399380-0-46005";"When I'm not terrified of dying, this job's pretty boring."
"165399380-0-46006";"If you have need of swords, speak with Maelen. His word guides us."
"165399380-0-46008";"Have to keep practicing. There's a war on, you know."
"165399380-0-46013";"A swift stream yields the tastiest fish. Few know this, but Minal shares with you."
"165399380-0-46015";"Welcome! Siege weapons win the wars, you know, no matter what the generals say."
"165399380-0-46020";"It is good that Mangeth likes to talk. He could not repair a siege engine to save his life."
"165399380-0-46063";"Slowly, now. You've been through an ordeal. Take a few moments to collect yourself."
"165399380-0-46064";"Run here, check on this, note down that—someday I'm going to stab Sorcalin with this quill."
"165399380-0-46067";"No time to talk, soldier. Grand Warlord Sorcalin keeps me running all day."
"165399380-0-46069";"I finished training yesterday. Had too much to drink. Need time to recover. Just go away."
"165399380-0-46084";"We'd better win this war, with all the crap I've had to haul for you soldiers."
"165399380-0-46089";"This one honors you for your service to the Dominion, walker. Nezashun will soon join you on the battlefields."
"165399380-0-46140";"What a dismal location for a battle! I can't wait until this whole thing is over and I can return to Auridon and put all this nonsense behind me."
"165399380-0-46151";"What destruction! What death! Oh, this entire situation brings a smile to my face."
"165399380-0-46171";"I can't believe you came here. And killed that monster of a man. Thank you."
"165399380-0-46175";"Used to be known as Fangs-Like-Steel. I changed my name when posted here."
"165399380-0-46178";"Greetings, wanderer. If you have come to speak with an augur, there are none present at this time. Augur Volso was the last to have blessed this refuge, and he passed to his reward several months ago."
"165399380-0-46185";"Smashing. So glad you could join us. Welcome to the Fighters Guild, which is rather a mundane name, isn't it? \n\nThough it is precise. They fight things and they're in a guild. Works rather well, actually, come to think of it."
"165399380-0-46189";"These Argonians don't know what cold is really like. Where I grew up, even our fires froze solid."
"165399380-0-46190";"Moth Priest Crassius is practically an augur. The ancestor moths sing to him, when outsiders are not about. His wisdom guides us in this refuge."
"165399380-0-46191";"Though the Elder Scrolls we studied have been taken from us, this is still a holy place. Walk reverentially here."
"165399380-0-46192";"I'm just an acolyte here, as you can tell from the vital tasks I've been given. Speak with Moth Priest Crassius in the temple, if you seek answers to questions."
"165399380-0-46193";"The cold here torments my body, but the serenity of this refuge soothes my spirit."
"165399380-0-46194";"While the Way of the Peaceful Fist cannot prevail against the hordes that stole our Elder Scrolls, it is sufficient to defend ourselves against wayfarers who come to despoil this refuge."
"165399380-0-46195";"Greetings, wayfarer. If you seek knowledge, speak with Moth Priest Crassius in the temple. My advice extends only to cooking."
"165399380-0-46196";"Onto the backs of a few fall the duties of many."
"165399380-0-46197";"Going crazy around this place. I need some live targets."
"165399380-0-46198";"Welcome to the Mages Guild enclave."
"165399380-0-46202";"Welcome. Is there anything the Mages Guild can do for you?"
"165399380-0-46203";"Greetings. You've stumbled across the Mages Guild enclave here in Nimalten."
"165399380-0-46204";"Welcome. Are you here on Mages Guild business?"
"165399380-0-46205";"I don't understand what you people see in this city. I mean, compared to the rest of Coldharbour, it's a bloody rathole."
"165399380-0-46206";"Welcome to the Mages Guild. Make yourself at home."
"165399380-0-46208";"This one is having some difficulty translating these pages. Your distraction is welcome."
"165399380-0-46212";"Gindur and I have a bet. Whoever collects the most Altmer ears in the first month of battle wins a dozen bottles of sujamma.\n\nI'm going to enjoy drinking that."
"165399380-0-46221";"You think generals are demanding? Try keeping a bunch of whiny merchants fed and supplied. Then you'll know what work really is."
"165399380-0-46236";"Oh, thank Y'ffre you're not one of the Wood Orcs, and you're not one of the strange people in that cave."
"165399380-0-46239";"I hope you've got a job for us. I'm sick of eating gritty bread at every meal."
"165399380-0-46242";"There's always another sword to sharpen, another piece of armor to clean. The work never ends around here."
"165399380-0-46251";"It is an honor to assist Grand Warlord Dortene. On the battlefield, I would be but one sword amongst thousands. Here, with Dortene, I help guide the course of the war."
"165399380-0-46257";"Going into battle without a siege weapon is like eating mountain bear hash without any teeth. You might live through it, but it won't be pleasant."
"165399380-0-46258";"Grand Warlord Zimmeron is demanding, but at least the constant movement keeps me warm."
"165399380-0-46259";"I do all the work and Ulg gets all the credit. I'll have my own shop one day and run her out of business."
"165399380-0-46262";"Organizing this camp is a never-ending task. No sooner do I get one pile straightened out and someone else makes another mess somewhere else."
"165399380-0-46331";"Get out of here, before they spot you. They'll kill us all!"
"165399380-0-46333";"When you're tired of being regular army, come join us. The food's good, the pay's good, and we take the jobs we want, not those some general forces on us. No suicide missions for us!"
"165399380-0-46343";"Another one who likes to stand around and watch work being done, eh? Well, this statue's not going to carve itself."
"165399380-0-46344";"There's nothing like a little ale after being on duty. Unfortunately, I never seem to stop at just a little."
"165399380-0-46345";"I hate always having to cook, but I'm the only one in camp who doesn't burn the food."
"165399380-0-46347";"I will bring honor and glory to my clan and the Covenant!"
"165399380-0-46349";"Greetings. When I sight on the target, I picture an Elven face there. My aim is true every time."
"165399380-0-46351";"Growing up, I longed to be a warrior. Now that I am, I long for home. I wonder if I'll ever be happy."
"165399380-0-46352";"Asheeus likes to talk. Why don't you go bother him and let me do my work?"
"165399380-0-46353";"Welcome to Gottlesfont Priory. You come at a sorry time, as we will soon close our doors, perhaps forever."
"165399380-0-46354";"Greetings, warrior. I pray that the Eight watch over you as you head to battle. Remain here as long as you like."
"165399380-0-46356";"I don't know why Dortene hasn't had all those trees chopped down. Hard to see if enemies are coming."
"165399380-0-46357";"These creatures show up in the night, try to take everything from Mura. This one has worked hard to make friends, find people who would accept her.\n\nMura will not allow these beasts to kill her friends."
"165399380-0-46362";"Even the fish here are foolish. No southern fish would bite at hooks in this cold. They would be sensibly buried in the mud, waiting for the weather to become liveable."
"165399380-0-46367";"The sisters are in the cathedral. They're in charge of the priory now, what's left of it."
"165399380-0-46369";"Only vigilance keeps the enemy from our gates."
"165399380-0-46373";"I love the feel of a skull splitting under my sword. But I hate all this waiting."
"165399380-0-46374";"Deliveries of supplies never stop around here. If the weather weren't so nice, it'd be pretty miserable."
"165399380-0-46375";"Do not stare so, warrior. Though Redguard mages are rare, we do exist."
"165399380-0-46376";"I keep thinking I see movement by the rocks. Must be shadows playing tricks on my eyes."
"165399380-0-46377";"Soldiers step out of line, they answer to me. A couple hundred laps around the camp usually straightens them out."
"165399380-0-46378";"Keep a sharp eye, soldier. We've spotted enemy spies out there. An army might not be far behind."
"165399380-0-46379";"How lucky am I? Apprentice to some of the best crafters in the Covenant!"
"165399380-0-46396";"It's, uh, good you got here when you did. You were much more, eh, merciful than I was about to be to those creatures."
"165399380-0-46397";"This one knew Ronyssa's daughter. She was a good girl. Full of life.\n\nWhat evil could have done this to us?"
"165399380-0-46398";"I still don't know what happened out there. I've never felt fear like that before. \n\nI just froze. Sorry about any trouble I gave you back there."
"165399380-0-46401";"We can use all the help we can get here. We've already lost a few brave scouts."
"165399380-0-46451";"Looks like the previous owner took a fall off the rocks in back. Bad luck for him, good luck for me. This place is mine now; go find your own."
"165399380-0-46470";"This cave is quite lovely, but have you seen the nightmarish landscape outside? How do you people keep your sanity? \n\nI believe I'll just remain indoors. Do let me know if I'm needed for anything heroic, won't you?"
"165399380-0-46494";"Tu'whacca's breath! Are all my efforts doomed to failure? Is there nowhere I cannot be found?"
"165399380-0-46516";"<Maujad appears to have been struck down by unholy magic.>"
"165399380-0-46531";"Are you with those loggers? Damn Admands. I never should have trusted them. Now they're chopping down all my trees."
"165399380-0-46534";"Dibella's legs! But you are a bold one! Even the bards of Wayrest sing of your exploits. \n\nI must confess—I had hoped to meet you one day. We sharpen our blades on the same whetstone, if you take my meaning."
"165399380-0-46540";"I've served the Thalmor for almost twenty years now, as an advisor in the matter of healing arts."
"165399380-0-46586";"I will stay your execution since you came all this way. But choose your words carefully. I'm not a patient king."
"165399380-0-46598";"Thank you for saving me."
"165399380-0-46612";"The lightest and finest armor, that's all I sell!"
"165399380-0-46613";"If you trust your life to inferior armor, you deserve the death you'll receive. I sell only the best."
"165399380-0-46628";"My armor protects and conceals. Neither heavy nor light armor does both!"
"165399380-0-46631";"Light armor gives you stealth and speed, both vital on the battlefield!"
"165399380-0-46638";"No armor defeats my weapons. No arrow straighter, no blade sharper!"
"165399380-0-46640";"Some think of my wares as trinkets. Think that if you will, but one of my trinkets could very well save your life!"
"165399380-0-46646";"Heavy armor repels heavy blows. What foe delivers the lovetaps that lighter armor can turn away?"
"165399380-0-46651";"Wisdom lies in being prepared for all eventualities. My weapons will ensure that."
"165399380-0-46654";"There's nothing like the feel of a good, skull-splitting weapon in your hand, is there? Go ahead, take a look."
"165399380-0-46655";"<It appears to be the corpse of an unfortunate mage. Possibly a low-ranking member of the Mages Guild based on his garb.>"
"165399380-0-46657";"Like a pebble rolling down from a mountaintop, sometimes the smallest of things can have great effects."
"165399380-0-46703";"It's well known that everyone attacks the least-armored foe on the battlefield. Don't make yourself a target—wear heavy armor."
"165399380-0-46704";"Please! Please! I can't breathe! I can't … breathe! Let me out!"
"165399380-0-46705";"To make an impact on the battlefield and impress the generals, you need siege weapons. Check out my stock!"
"165399380-0-46709";"Ahh … it's the Mane's pet. Are you here to let me out? I can't wait to dig my fingers into your very soul."
"165399380-0-46757";"That was close."
"165399380-0-46759";"Fire … pain! Faolchu … repent. Please … release me."
"165399380-0-46760";"This one is grateful for your help."
"165399380-0-46777";"Sorry, stranger. I'm here on important business with the Mages Guild seeking some rogue members of our organization. I don't have time for idle conversation."
"165399380-0-46781";"Vanus is a dear man. In many ways, he is family to me. Since he has given you his trust, I'm willing to set aside our differences. But under different circumstances, you and I would be sworn enemies."
"165399380-0-46782";"This one's eye is on you. Make one move against the Queen and this one will cut you down."
"165399380-0-46788";"Mind the skies. There are harpies about."
"165399380-0-46794";"<This man is wearing the uniform of a Mages Guild acolyte. His face is contorted in fear and pain. However he died, it was sudden and unpleasant.>"
"165399380-0-46799";"For soldiers, this is a waystation, one place among many they will see in Cyrodiil. For myself, it is home and I would be nowhere else."
"165399380-0-46800";"I hate to say it, but this place is starting to get a bit overwhelming.\n\nNah, I'm just kidding. This has been exciting so far! I'm having a great time!"
"165399380-0-46806";"And how can I help you, warrior?"
"165399380-0-46808";"Let them attack. I'm eager to prove myself in battle."
"165399380-0-46820";"It took a bit of work, but I was able to track you down. Just one of my many gifts, if you must know."
"165399380-0-46822";"You soldiers better use these furnaces. I'm not hauling all this wood for nothing, you know."
"165399380-0-46841";"Shimmy tries to be patient, but he never holds out for long."
"165399380-0-46843";"Huh. Another soldier. You here to break things or buy something?"
"165399380-0-46846";"This one is clever, always taunting her foe to strike first. I will not fall to her wiles this time."
"165399380-0-46857";"If you want to see them in action, hire us. Talk to Milva inside and make a deal, get us out of this damned place."
"165399380-0-46883";"There's nothing like a good meal after a hard day. Sadly, this is nothing like a good meal."
"165399380-0-46895";"I'd rather clean up after pigs than soldiers. At least pigs don't crap where they sleep."
"165399380-0-46897";"Go … away …."
"165399380-0-46925";"Don't mind me. I'll be fine. It takes more than a few Daedra to finish me off."
"165399380-0-46937";"Thank you."
"165399380-0-46960";"In Hammerfell, it is said that any food is preferable to starvation. Those who speak so have never tasted army food."
"165399380-0-46961";"Everyone complains about my cooking, but no one offers to do it themselves. Typical."
"165399380-0-46973";"Speak with Roshan. I just work here."
"165399380-0-46977";"The enchanting facilities upstairs are open to all who wish to use them."
"165399380-0-46982";"An army that attacks here, gets crushed. I look forward to that."
"165399380-0-46986";"Excellent fighters, these orcs. I once saw Thoga slice an Elf's head clean off his shoulders. We laughed for days about that one."
"165399380-0-46993";"This post will not be taken while I can wield my sword."
"165399380-0-46994";"Take care of your mount, and he'll take care of you."
"165399380-0-46995";"Yeah, I'm wearing human armor, so what? Mine was stolen at Fort Ash. How do Bretons fit their heads into these tiny things?"
"165399380-0-46996";"Bad food, poor pay, and deadly work. If the ale weren't good, I'd quit."
"165399380-0-46998";"Only constant vigilance keeps the enemy from our door. I am honored to do my part for the Covenant."
"165399380-0-47001";"Dydier spends too much time atop the tower. War looks glamorous when you're high above the bloody fields."

"165399380-0-47118";"Want armor that doesn't clank loudly with every step, slowing you down and alerting your enemies? Look no farther!"
"165399380-0-47121";"Moderation in all things, including armor. I have what you need, warrior!"
"165399380-0-47122";"Want to cut through armor to get to the delicious meat inside? The tools you need are right here!"
"165399380-0-47124";"Without the right accessories, you're not ready for war."
"165399380-0-47127";"Fear no blade or arrow in my armor!"
"165399380-0-47174";"Fur in your food is just an added bonus, friend."
"165399380-0-47175";"Ah! Another sharp-minded citizen!\n\nDo you also prefer not to be ravaged by Reachmen?"
"165399380-0-47177";"When the troops cram in here before deployment, you could die of thirst in this place. Take me days to find your body too."
"165399380-0-47178";"Ah! Did you hear the voice of reason and come to listen more closely?\n\nThe Reachmen are at the city's doorstep. Something must be done, must it not?"
"165399380-0-47180";"Drink up, soldier. No ale out in the field."
"165399380-0-47215";"Sharul fights for coin, not politics. Coin purchases more two-moon cordial."
"165399380-0-47217";"Not all mercenaries are motivated by greed. Some choose this life for reasons no less honorable than yours."

"165399380-0-47226";"You've a mind to weave enchantments, I take it? Do be careful with the equipment. Like everything in my shop it's spotless … and expensive. \n\nI've a few enchantments of my own if you're interested. Have a look."
"165399380-0-47228";"<The doe's throat was recently slashed.>"
"165399380-0-47231";"This staging area requires constant supervision. I serve as General Marenil's eyes and ears throughout the camp."
"165399380-0-47233";"If it were up to me, I'd toss those mercenaries out of camp. They're nothing but spies who'll sell out to the highest bidder."

"165399380-0-47242";"Ah—Nabina-ko is glad to finally see someone with jah in their purse. You've come to look over my potions, yes? Each is a fragrant gem, walker. Potent as skooma and sweet as sugar! Behold!"
"165399380-0-47243";"You, there! The Covenant is threatened by more than filthy Reachmen and Imperial conscripts! The Pact and the Dominion are poised to pounce. We must take up the sword to defend our homeland!"
"165399380-0-47247";"Blessings of St. Pelin be upon you. What brings you to the house of the Divines? Do you need aid or shelter?"
"165399380-0-47249";"Few come here. The tavern seems more popular with soldiers."
"165399380-0-47253";"By Zenithar, it's good to see someone with a heavy purse again—we haven't had a deposit in days. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-47254";"Greetings, my friend. You've come to make a deposit, yes?"
"165399380-0-47255";"Comrade … Aelif never thought to see you again. What are you doing here?"
"165399380-0-47256";"Perhaps the gods do not intercede on mortals' behalf. But I'm unwilling to take that chance before battle."
"165399380-0-47264";"I heard there was an important meeting going on. I'm sure they meant to invite me. After all, important meetings lead to quests, and quests are my speciality!\n\nI'm always ready to smite evil and preserve the natural beauty of Coldharbour."
"165399380-0-47266";"Enough. Enough! I'm ending this story now."
"165399380-0-47269";"I find the wisdom of my ancestors soothes me on the eve of battle."
"165399380-0-47284";"I cannot wait to return to Hammerfell. This city stinks of dog and bird droppings."
"165399380-0-47285";"I am a long way from Ash Mountain and the warm climate of Stonefalls.\n\nBut I have committed my time and talent to helping the Mages Guild here in Coldharbour. Hopefully, this will soon be over and we can return to our homes."
"165399380-0-47286";"Nice Fighters Guild hall! It's got all the comforts of home. But I'm ready to get out there and fight. \n\nYou can only plan so much. Sometimes you need to swing your damned axe and move forward."
"165399380-0-47297";"Until we take back the Imperial City, no one crosses this bridge!"
"165399380-0-47305";"Yes?"
"165399380-0-47306";"General Braning is a harsh taskmistress. My work never seems to end. Get out into the field as soon as you can, before she finds something for you to do."
"165399380-0-47307";"Halt! No one passes here."
"165399380-0-47317";"You can't get through here. Even if you survive the monsters, the bridge is in ruins."
"165399380-0-47334";"Fancy yourself a clothier? Well, I'm the best in town. You'll need some of my goods if you want to keep up."
"165399380-0-47349";"Soldiers cut down trees to make siege engines, which in turn cut down soldiers. I sense a lesson in this, but it escapes me."
"165399380-0-47350";"The captain of the Bjoulsae Queen still hasn't furnished me with her manifest! I suspected smuggling, but the guard won't even help me enforce the laws."
"165399380-0-47352";"Talk to Golvy if you wish to purchase. Rest assured, machines made by me fulfill their duties."
"165399380-0-47364";"We are ready. We await only General Marenil's orders to attack. Until then, we try not to go crazy with boredom."
"165399380-0-47369";"The general likes his home tidy. If the books aren't lined up like soldiers on review, he makes me run laps around the house."
"165399380-0-47373";"I've been following Angranel around for years now, keeping her house and making her meals. This is the nicest place we've ever stayed. It's usually a leaky tent with mud floors."
"165399380-0-47389";"Quiet in here right now. No stabbings, no bodies to toss out the door, no broken furniture. I could get used to this."
"165399380-0-47392";"Yeah, what is it? If the sarge sent you, tell him I'm not coming. I'm going to sit here and drink until I pass out or piss myself. Or both."
"165399380-0-47399";"<The torn and bitten flesh of this recently murdered victim displays remarkably little blood for such a violent death.>"
"165399380-0-47409";"Siege weapons win wars, no matter what the generals tell you."
"165399380-0-47426";"The other soldiers laugh at me, but my soul yearns for sweet, gentle music. If only my father had let me become a bard, instead of forcing me into the army!"
"165399380-0-47428";"These louts better be ready for the battle of their miserable lives, because they haven't seen anything yet!"
"165399380-0-47430";"I am proud of the Guilds and what we have accomplished thus far, but it isn't over yet. I hope we can continue this unprecedented cooperation a while longer, for I fear our greatest challenge is yet to come."
"165399380-0-47433";"So you have fought your way to Molag Bal's gates, outsider. Saying I am impressed would be an understatement.\n\nAs promised, I have come to give you a gift from my people. It will aid you in your coming battles."
"165399380-0-47445";"These poor bastards. They're just trying to find some place safe, but disaster seems to follow after them."
"165399380-0-47446";"Here's someone who's seen a battle or two. You've read the writing on the wall, haven't you, my friend?"
"165399380-0-47462";"Vanus wants me to round up this interesting bunch and lead them into the battle. This should be … challenging? Yes, that's a word.\n\nI understand you're going in ahead of us. Be careful in there. And leave a few Daedra for us to deal with!"
"165399380-0-47599";"We've come from Senalana to help secure the Mane's ascension."
"165399380-0-47612";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47613";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47614";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47616";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47617";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47618";"Thank you for your help in Greenhill."
"165399380-0-47619";"Your work here and in Falinesti should be a beacon for others."
"165399380-0-47620";"Your work here and in Falinesti should be a beacon for others."
"165399380-0-47621";"Your work here and in Falinesti should be a beacon for others."
"165399380-0-47622";"Your work here and in Falinesti should be a beacon for others."
"165399380-0-47623";"Dune and Willowgrove wouldn't be the same without your help, my friend."
"165399380-0-47624";"Dune and Willowgrove wouldn't be the same without your help, my friend."
"165399380-0-47625";"Dune and Willowgrove wouldn't be the same without your help, my friend."
"165399380-0-47626";"S'ren-ja salutes you, walker."
"165399380-0-47627";"S'ren-ja salutes you, walker."
"165399380-0-47628";"S'ren-ja salutes you, walker."
"165399380-0-47650";"Leave this business with the Reachmen to the militia. A pack of howling hill-dwellers dressed in skins is not a matter worthy of your skills."
"165399380-0-47656";"When times are tough, there's always beer! … I hope."
"165399380-0-47660";"Welcome to the Bay-Tar's Mess, mate! \n\nBe careful not to step on any toes here; everyone's a little on edge, and I only allow one bar-fight per day."
"165399380-0-47663";"Ah-ha! Another would-be brewer. I can always tell."
"165399380-0-47664";"Greetings, customer! Or so I hope. \n\nMy other customers say I sample these delectable morsels far too often. But how else can I be sure of their quality? Eh?"
"165399380-0-47665";"Those Reachmen—by St. Pelin's sacrifice, they're inhuman. I saw their faces beneath the rotten leathers. Black eyes … like a troll's eyes. Gods help us."
"165399380-0-47711";"I trust you plan to purchase something?"
"165399380-0-47712";"What can I get you today?\n\nEverything's made right here in town by my father, Merail Avani."
"165399380-0-47722";"It is time, Vestige. Sai Sahan's strength has returned. You must accompany him to his ancestral home in the Valley of Blades."
"165399380-0-47750";"Hail, friend. I apologize for the mess. The chapel is usually a bit more … tidy."
"165399380-0-47752";"Are you headed to the Mages Guildhall? I've been waiting on a shipment of nirnroot for days! Magister Sernays will not be best pleased. If he says anything about turning Jernald into a goat, you'll let me know, right?"
"165399380-0-47754";"We set out for Skyrim in a few days. I hope the drovers Dalmi sends with us smell better than the last bunch."
"165399380-0-47757";"Honor to you, traveler. You don't look like one of those poor devils out on the street. But if you've come for work, I'm afraid there's none to be had."
"165399380-0-47758";"I'd rather drink alone if it's all the same to you, f'lah."
"165399380-0-47760";"I ask Master Larhoth for guidance. He says ""poke sharp end"" into the fighting doll. Fine advice, no?"
"165399380-0-47784";"They get you to join up, too? \n\nFrankly, I'm just here for the chow."
"165399380-0-47837";"Greetings, warrior. I have mounts for sale, if you need one. Do not travel Cyrodiil on foot!"
"165399380-0-47838";"Looking for a mount? I have the fastest ones in all Cyrodiil!"
"165399380-0-47839";"If it's a mount you want, a mount you shall have. None finer in all of Cyrodiil!"
"165399380-0-47885";"May St. Pelin watch over you, traveler. I'm afraid I can't tarry. There are many here who require my attention."
"165399380-0-47888";"Ah, hello there, my lovely! You look thirsty. See anything you like? Of course you do. Ha—by Dibella, I'm such a tease! Can I get you something?"
"165399380-0-47889";"You a sailor? I don't suppose you're setting out anytime soon? I'm a fair carpenter—I just need a way out of this town."
"165399380-0-47891";"If you're thirsty, you'll want to talk to Mortine. Dibella knows she'll want to talk to you. \n\nIf it's grub you're after, you're talking to the right person. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-47896";"This inn has quite an impressive library. I'm surprised the Mages Guild hasn't ransacked the place."
"165399380-0-47915";"Have you any news from Northglen? My aunt lives there, but I've not seen her among the refugees."
"165399380-0-47918";"I left Sentinel shortly after the dead started rising. I've got a real talent for migrating to doomed cities."
"165399380-0-47921";"Divines bless you, friend! Rivenspire has become a hard place to earn a living. My eleven children will surely starve today without a morsel to eat.\n\nWon't you spare some gold for an honest man and his poor children?"
"165399380-0-47922";"Are you Smythe?"
"165399380-0-47936";"Divines give me strength—in my time I've helped both the poor and the wounded, but never both at once."
"165399380-0-47938";"He told me he wished he could stay, but he couldn't be in two places at once. I think I proved him wrong."
"165399380-0-47940";"Once again, you succeeded at the task set before you. Well done, my friend."
"165399380-0-47941";"I didn't fight my way up here just to wiggle my toes in front of a fire. There's killing to do!\n\nIf Verandis tells me to wait here one more time, I may just have to stab him."
"165399380-0-47942";"I'm trying to talk some sense into the Countess. She needs to abandon all this Light nonsense and start trusting in herself and her own abilities.\n\nBesides, she's much too pretty to hide her head inside a prayer book all the time."
"165399380-0-47966";"Sebazi greets you, walker. Return when you have risen higher in the Fighters Guild."
"165399380-0-47968";"Greetings, comrade. You must rise higher in the Fighters Guild to hear of the contracts I offer."
"165399380-0-47969";"My contracts are for high-ranking members of the Fighters Guild. I cannot offer them to you yet."
"165399380-0-48064";"Solid ground, beautiful surroundings, and a customer! What more could an Elf want?"
"165399380-0-48065";"I thought I heard the jingle of coins approaching. Care to make a purchase?"
"165399380-0-48116";"Soldiers … soldiers everywhere! They've turned our holy site into a slave camp.\n\nGet out of here while you still can!"
"165399380-0-48118";"Your sharp claws played no small part in the rise of the new Mane, walker. Be proud of your achievement and know you have the eternal thanks of the Khajiiti people."
"165399380-0-48120";"My friend, you definitely bring the party. A new Mane, dead Daedra in the streets … I can't wait to draw steel with you again."
"165399380-0-48123";"Blood and toil! The new Mane will do just fine … thanks to you."
"165399380-0-48124";"Impressive work. Very impressive work indeed!"
"165399380-0-48253";"Many pray for the return of the Walking City. I seek to honor Falinesti's memory."
"165399380-0-48302";"Your soul is restored. I can see its light within you. And you have saved your world from a great calamity. \n\nBut know this, mortal. The forces of Oblivion are legion, and the God of Schemes is but a single player in a complex battle for supremacy."
"165399380-0-48358";"You have done much for Shornhelm and Rivenspire. I hesitate to ask more of you, but I am concerned about Tainted-Heart. \n\nI sent one of my best Captains, Janeve, to track him and hopefully eliminate him."
"165399380-0-48368";"I would simply like to escape this prison."
"165399380-0-48388";"I have some beverages for sale, but do exercise caution. The penalties for spell-weaving while inebriated are … severe."
"165399380-0-48434";"Quite a battle! I suspect you'll need a few things before you set out again. \n\nMy stock's a bit sparse, but I still have a few items for sale."
"165399380-0-48437";"You were leading the charge, eh? I can tell from the state of your armor … no offense. Why not buy a shiny new breastplate? Mara knows you've earned it!"
"165399380-0-48438";"It is difficult to find a blade worthy of Onsi's blessing outside the Alik'r—but I do have a few fine swords worth inspecting. Take a look."
"165399380-0-48440";"Care to have a look?"
"165399380-0-48442";"Are you bound for southern Bangkorai? It's an unforgiving place, my friend. Why not have a bite before you leave?\n\nMight be your last good meal for a while."
"165399380-0-48444";"I don't know about you, but laying siege to a fortress and killing a half-dozen Imperial soldiers makes me thirsty!"
"165399380-0-48447";"I would like to put him with the rest of the wounded, but it is too dangerous to move him. \n\nI fear it will not be long before Tu'whacca comes to claim him."
"165399380-0-48448";"I thought the Garrison would be a little … I don't know … grander. What a dump. \n\nGlad I'm not one of the poor bastards who died for this place."
"165399380-0-48450";"The battle for the Garrison has left us all weary, friend. These tents are sparsely furnished, but might afford you some rest and comfort. Shall I prepare one for you?"
"165399380-0-48451";"Just have to … walk it off."
"165399380-0-48453";"Bah! Imperial cowards …. Dogs and sons of dogs! They were right to pierce me with an arrow. Attacking me with a sword is … is an errand for fools."
"165399380-0-48455";"Say what you want about the Imperials, but they make damn decent armor. It's a real shame we beat it all to pieces."
"165399380-0-48456";"Well, I took down six or seven before I fell. \n\nIf I don't make it … and you see the priest speaking my eulogy—tell him I took fifteen. Mauloch loves a good tale."
"165399380-0-48465";"Don't suppose you saw a loose squirrel foot around here …?"
"165399380-0-48466";"If you've come to mock or assault these soldiers, I suggest you move on."
"165399380-0-48468";"The healers tell me they might be able to save my arm, but it'll never be the same.\n\nI say cut it off. By Leki's first lunge, I will not be weighed down by a useless limb."
"165399380-0-48469";"I've not been north of the Garrison since I was a child. It is good to see a little green in the world."
"165399380-0-48470";"Hmph. I guess this is Yagramak's last brawl. Damn shame. \n\nIf I see Mauloch, I'll put in a good word for you."
"165399380-0-48471";"""Uuth! The stables need tending to!"" ""Uuth, the horses need feeding!"" Mauloch's left tusk, I'm tempted to just eat the cursed beasts. \n\nWell, you here for a horse or what?"
"165399380-0-48472";"We lost too many Lion Guards taking back this pile of rocks. Far too many. \n\nIf Queen Arzhela's commitment to the Covenant falters after this, I'll march on Evermore myself."
"165399380-0-48478";"Ah, the flame. It can bring comfort on a cold night, or reduce one's enemies to embers on the wind. \n\nForgive an old Elf his ramblings. You are welcome here among the Mages Guild."
"165399380-0-48525";"Treat your mount well and it will never betray you."
"165399380-0-48526";"These Wood Elves have a way with animals—when they aren't trying to eat them, that is. I've had much success raising strong horses here. If it's a trustworthy steed you seek, you'll find no better than these."
"165399380-0-48536";"We must arm ourselves, body and soul, for the obstacles ahead.\n\nTo do any less is an insult to those who have gone before us."
"165399380-0-48545";"Peer review and cooperative research is the root of all arcane development.\n\nThe Psijics formed for just such a purpose, did you know that? And from them came we, the Mages Guild."
"165399380-0-48557";"Come to do some blacksmithing, eh? Well take up the tongs and get to it! \n\nI've got some goods here you might like. Fair prices too. Interested?"
"165399380-0-48586";"Traveling to Onsi's Breath? Do you wish to be enslaved?\n\nImperial soldiers will drag you into the mines if you're not careful. That's how they caught us."
"165399380-0-48640";"I'm sorry, I'm retired."
"165399380-0-48641";"Delectable sweets from the heart of Elsweyr, brought here at great expense!\n\nYou seem quite the discerning walker. Care to browse?"
"165399380-0-48642";"Delicious fruits from the Summerset arbors! Our grapes are the freshest this side of the Abecean!"
"165399380-0-48660";"What is it?"
"165399380-0-48674";"This one makes soup. Tasty, fills your belly, keeps the plague away."
"165399380-0-48675";"So many people have gone. Damn the plague! Who am I going to sell my delicious beverages to?\n\nBah, maybe it's time for me to move on."
"165399380-0-48709";"He's always just, and always right. We'll scrub the town until it's bright.\n\nHe leads us down a golden path, away from filth and free from wrath."
"165399380-0-48726";"The Order of St. Pelin thanks you for your aid here at the Garrison. We owe you a great debt."
"165399380-0-48727";"Why are we even bothering to heal these flyblown Imperials? They're bound for the dungeon or the gallows. \n\nNothing but a waste of effort and supplies, if you ask me."
"165399380-0-48728";"I'm terribly sorry, but the inn is closed for business."
"165399380-0-48730";"I only listen to the fire."
"165399380-0-48739";"A poultice to bind your wounds? Restorative elixirs to sooth your skin? <<1>> has it all!"
"165399380-0-48746";"My father is an influential tribune, you Covenant cur! He won't stand for his son being treated like … like chattel."
"165399380-0-48770";"Please, walker. Shoo! Go away!"
"165399380-0-48773";"I lost my head back there. <<1>> says it's not cowardice if you're transformed into a bear by a town full of crazy people. I guess that's true."
"165399380-0-48774";"You know, my time as a bear was somewhat liberating.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad you saved me, but it was fun while it lasted."
"165399380-0-48780";"Not only did they kidnap us from our own homes, they tried to turn us into bloodfiends!"
"165399380-0-48814";"Any enemy of Montclair is a friend in my book. Thanks for releasing me."
"165399380-0-48868";"What's Rivenspire coming to? Tales of vampires roaming the countryside. Bandits camped outside our town. The noble houses at war.\n\nAnd people want to know why I spend my days drinking in this inn!"
"165399380-0-48892";"What's the rush, my friend? I have a message for you."
"165399380-0-48894";"Time to explain"
"165399380-0-48907";"Please, get me out of here. I saw what they did to the others. It is a fate worse than death."
"165399380-0-48908";"I'm tired of trying to convince people to buy my wares. I'm just going to lay it out here and you can tell me if you see anything you want.\n\nYou should definitely buy something, though. I mean it."
"165399380-0-48919";"The power we seek is close! I can feel it!"
"165399380-0-48927";"My father told me how you kept Mother's condition a secret. I … I thought you were better than that.\n\nI think you need to leave me alone until this is done, Verandis."
"165399380-0-48995";"And the thorn in my side returns. Your prince has accepted the gift I offered. He is a visionary. He sees beyond convention.\n\nBut what about you? Do you still question the value of my blessing?"
"165399380-0-49037";"I worry about Verandis. I know I shouldn't. He's brilliant and strong. But this whole thing with Montclair and the death of Lleraya. It has him all torn up inside."
"165399380-0-49056";"Please, I just want to be alone right now. A dear friend didn't survive the occupation and … and I don't feel like talking about it."
"165399380-0-49059";"I should probably be more frightened, what with fighting vampires and dodging blood curses and all. But damn if I'm not having fun!"
"165399380-0-49071";"For centuries I languished, trapped in the husk of that cold machine.\n\nMy dear Klathzgar; he only wanted us to be together. But once I was in the machine, I could no longer express my feelings. He may never have even realized I was conscious."
"165399380-0-49091";"Fifteen apologies, but my stock is khaj-dry. Dungy Imperials stole nearly everything I did not sell to the Knights. \n\nLuckily for you, Sanua-la is good at hiding things. Take a look."
"165399380-0-49092";"Oh, just leave me alone!\n\nThe horses are all dead or carried off. I don't have anything left for you.\n\nI'm sorry, just go."
"165399380-0-49093";"Usually, where there are soldiers there is drink and song. But these Knights of St. Pelin, they pray, and complain, and drink only water. \n\nYou are more fun, yes?"
"165399380-0-49094";"You have seen battle this day, yes? You must eat! What will you have? Greedy-Gut will put on the pot. It is not healthy to go to bed with an empty belly."
"165399380-0-49099";"Hrmph. Not much left in stock, but if you see something you want, just let me know."
"165399380-0-49107";"Mind your eyes, you knave. Do I look like some mangy Baandari hustler to you? In the guild we have rules about fraternization and lewd advances."
"165399380-0-49120";"Hey there, friend. You're blocking my view of the fire. And the heat, too. Mind shifting a bit?"
"165399380-0-49122";"Before all this trouble, dinner conversation consisted of all manner of interesting subjects. Now all that anyone wants to talk about is Montclair and vampires.\n\nI just want life to get back to normal around here."
"165399380-0-49128";"I've decided to record my experiences with the creatures of the night. You know, vampires and such like. \n\nWhen I'm done, I intend to compile them into a novella. It'll make me a wealthy man, I tell you!"
"165399380-0-49131";"So many dead. So many wounded. \n\nThose Imperials may not wear animal skins, but at heart they're as bad as the Reachmen."
"165399380-0-49132";"When I shipped out with these knights, I thought I'd be using my needle and thread to mend their tunics, not their wounds. Maybe you can use these goods for something a bit less … gory."
"165399380-0-49133";"I never really thought this day would come. But it is what Verandis has been training me for.\n\nI guess we're really going in there. Into the Doomcrag. It's a bit scary, but I'm with Verandis to the end."
"165399380-0-49139";"Welcome to the Sloshing Tankard! Please don't take the name literally—I'm sick to death of cleaning these floors."
"165399380-0-49143";"I'm looking for someone, and she is not you. Leave me be."
"165399380-0-49190";"I prefer the woods of <<1>>, but sometimes you go where the work takes you."
"165399380-0-49192";"Dominion troops are stingy with coin, but you're an adventurer of refined tastes. Yes, one who appreciates quality wares."
"165399380-0-49195";"Gravedigging doesn't pay too well, but there's never a shortage of work."
"165399380-0-49203";"<There's a dead knight on the floor of this cell.>"
"165399380-0-49205";"Turn back now. And take the other mortals with you.\n\nYour flesh and blood is too fragile to withstand the power of the cursed relic."
"165399380-0-49227";"I trust you have spoken to Tamrith and Dorell. Are the soldiers standing guard at the second portal?"
"165399380-0-49234";"This one enjoys the great tree, but truly appreciates those who gather in its shade."
"165399380-0-49241";"The roads are dangerous. Be sure you're well stocked, friend."
"165399380-0-49245";"I don't make many sales here. Come, take advantage of my misfortune. I need to move stock!"
"165399380-0-49246";"The Imperials' tricks are undone, but your stone city will still fall.\n\nThrough crows' eyes I spy your weak defenses. These lands belong to the Reach, and we will soon sweep through!"
"165399380-0-49247";"You can buy in Redfur. Or you can buy from me, to save some coin."
"165399380-0-49322";"Very funny I find it that you have come so far from your stone city.\n\nAre you a little lamb lost in the forest? I could have this crow shepherd you back home."
"165399380-0-49370";"Look at this! We leave you alone for a bit and look what happens. The Countess, the Baron, even the little vampire—down and out for the count!\n\nWell, we're here now. So what are you waiting for? Go and kick Montclair's arse!"
"165399380-0-49384";"I'm not going to be a refugee forever. Life's too short to always be on the run."
"165399380-0-49391";"Things are just so wretched these days. So much misery and filth … how are we supposed to live like this?"
"165399380-0-49406";"I never thought I'd get away from them! I've never run so fast in my life."
"165399380-0-49414";"I'm not sure why, but it seemed like the Baron expected me to turn into some kind of vampire or something."
"165399380-0-49418";"Thank you for helping Verandis. For helping me.\n\nIf it hadn't been for you, well, I … I don't want to think about it."
"165399380-0-49422";"Eselde is still breathing. That's a good sign, right? Of course it is!"
"165399380-0-49440";"House Ravenwatch is in your debt, Five-Claw.\n\nThank you."
"165399380-0-49461";"<The multiple cuts on this Wood Elf's body appear to have come from an axe. His hands are calloused, and he wears the simple clothing of a tradesman.>"
"165399380-0-49462";"We need <<1>> alive. But if she runs, I'm putting an arrow through her ankle."
"165399380-0-49482";"I don't guess you've run into a big, lumbering, brute of an Orc in your travels? Name's Storgh. Was a friend of mine, emphasis on the ""was.""\n\nI'm in a pile of trouble because of him."
"165399380-0-49505";"It's finally over, isn't it?\n\nWhat a terrible price we had to pay for this victory, though. A lot of good men and woman died—including Verandis. For a vampire, he turned out to be an honorable man."
"165399380-0-49511";"Please, they might come into the tent at any moment! The only chance I have is to get away while they aren't looking!"
"165399380-0-49533";"Being the only Orc in the order has its benefits, I suppose. Like … well …. \n\nUhm. I'm sure I can come up with something. Eventually."
"165399380-0-49541";"Divines forgive us. To be bested by a flock of leather-clad draftees … I almost hope this wound proves fatal. Better to die than to live with this choking shame."
"165399380-0-49550";"Greetings. I have a wide selection of rare delicacies, if you are buying. Eggs from the legendary Wamasu, perhaps?"
"165399380-0-49553";"Do you see something you like?"
"165399380-0-49554";"You know the best thing about being a cook? You are never out of work. Sand storms, invasions,  occupations … but still, everyone needs to eat!\n\nSpeaking of which, you look famished. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-49555";"Each new piece I unpack is bought immediately. Take a look, before everything is sold from under your very nose!"
"165399380-0-49557";"Look at your posture! Why do you hunch over so? \n\nWeighed down by your burdens, I'll wager. Luckily for you, I have many backpacks and satchels to sell."
"165399380-0-49569";"Is a gold drake too much to ask from one as noble-looking as you?"
"165399380-0-49572";"The Grandeya is outside? I hope she finds the palace to her liking."
"165399380-0-49574";"I can understand killing people, but trampling plants? It's inhuman!"
"165399380-0-49579";"Please tell my dear sister that I'm still waiting for that apology."
"165399380-0-49581";"Please. Release me. I have to get back to Lorelia. I have to."
"165399380-0-49582";"Please get me out of here! These Daedric cultists have been torturing me!"
"165399380-0-49608";"Even in the south, I can't seem to keep these old bones warm. Heh! Share my fire if you like, as long as you bring no trouble with you. This war is for younger men than I."
"165399380-0-49629";"May the Light bathe and bless these people. May it guide their way and grant peace to those they have lost."
"165399380-0-49667";"They dragged him into an alley, dragged him like a sack of horse feed! Then … oh, Tu'whacca help me.\n\nPray for my son, O wayfarer. And for me."
"165399380-0-49670";"A city can be repaired. A heart will mend. But memories can never be erased."
"165399380-0-49674";"I can no longer hold a weapon properly in these hands. Too many broken bones over the years."
"165399380-0-49675";"My beautiful abomination! How you shine in the dark. \n\nBut heed a mother's warning."
"165399380-0-49676";"Be wary, my friend. There are worse things than Imperials in the deep deserts of Hammerfell."
"165399380-0-49678";"Some drink to forget. I drink to honor the fallen. Is that a crime?"
"165399380-0-49687";"This used to be a quiet place. And then we built walls. Suddenly our town became a city, ripe for plunder."
"165399380-0-49688";"We had hoped you would come. We have watched you ever since you first emerged from Coldharbour. \n\nIf you were like other mortals you would soon turn. But you are unique."
"165399380-0-49692";"I sent my husband to the market to see if any vegetables are left.\n\nMeanwhile he's busy looking for produce at the bottom of every bottle at the inn."
"165399380-0-49694";"Disturb me not. I pray for the dead."
"165399380-0-49697";"I don't recall an appointment for this hour. Come back another time."
"165399380-0-49698";"Tread carefully. An army is massing under our feet. I don't know how this happened.\n\nSomehow the Covenant has managed to fill this ruin with troops, and more seem to be arriving as if out of thin air."
"165399380-0-49701";"I used to own a goat farm, but the smell got to me after a while."
"165399380-0-49705";"My scales bake in this sun. I welcome the heat, but not the arid air."
"165399380-0-49706";"Please tell my beloved brother that he has a better chance of squeezing fire salts out of an ice cube than he does of receiving an apology from me."
"165399380-0-49708";"<This Khajiit mercenary was recently slain. There are no visible wounds on the front of his body.>"
"165399380-0-49710";"I tend to their child's education, but not much longer. She's already quite the lady."
"165399380-0-49714";"If you're not here on Dominion business, I'll need you to move along. My time is precious."
"165399380-0-49715";"Sorry, friend. If you're here for goods I'm afraid my supply has run dry. \n\nI was researching the kwama in Burroot mine, but I had to abandon everything. Even my research was left behind in that mine."
"165399380-0-49771";"You have come seeking a steed, is it not so? I have given the Imperials naught but wheezing mares and half-dead nags. I have saved my best stock for you!"
"165399380-0-49774";"Hail, friend! I heard shouting about Imperials invading or somesuch. Is that true? I … well … I don't really get out much.\n\nI've been busy, you see? Take a look at the fruits of my labor—the best enchantments in all of Bangkorai."
"165399380-0-49776";"Just because I can't chop wood doesn't mean I can't hawk it! What do you need?"
"165399380-0-49777";"You want supplies? I have supplies. Fresh down the river today."
"165399380-0-49789";"Let me guess … another sticky-fingered Mages Guild docent, yes? \n\nWell, we have labored long and long to assemble this collection. Tell your heretical masters if they want to plunder our cultural heritage, they'll have to look elsewhere."
"165399380-0-49793";"According to this ledger, the Imperials ate more than half of our emergency food stores. Zehts tears…. Looks like we'll be eating nothing but salted lamb until the next harvest."
"165399380-0-49798";"So much to do to prepare for the Grandeya!  I have tried to keep the palace tidy in her absence, but those Imperials lived like wild animals."
"165399380-0-49799";"Tell me you found something good, hero. It's not like the fate of Rivenspire is hanging in the balance or anything."
"165399380-0-49807";"What're you looking at? Just 'cause I'm an Orc I can't enjoy the finer things? Go swallow sand!"
"165399380-0-49814";"I like the sound of the water. It's soothing. Plus, I get burned a lot. You know how it is. Get you something?"
"165399380-0-49815";"My blades are as good as any a fancy-dress High Elf would make. Try one, and see!"
"165399380-0-49818";"Who says High Elves are fragile? C'mon! Hit me! Or … just browse my wares. That's fine too."
"165399380-0-49819";"Leather has so many uses, don't you think? Armor, especially useful. Try some on today!"
"165399380-0-49820";"I can tell you're smarter than most of the unwashed masses that pass by our stall. Try my armor … special, just for you!"
"165399380-0-49827";"I'm not sure how Montclair and his troops stand this armor. It's itchy and it smells like rotten mudcrab meat."
"165399380-0-49830";"I find it hard to believe that Baron Dorell allowed a smuggler to dig a tunnel into his city—and right under his very nose!\n\nStill, it is our good fortune that this tunnel exists. The Light truly shines on those who need it."
"165399380-0-49851";"Participating in this ceremony means you accept a dark fate. Will you proceed?"
"165399380-0-49896";"I thought my son might be hiding here, in his office. But all I found was his journal. You might as well have a look."
"165399380-0-49899";"Letting a noble woman wander alone through a city full of vampires and bloodfiends. What was Skordo thinking?"
"165399380-0-49905";"<The soldier's throat is slit, and there are numerous bruises on her exposed skin.>"
"165399380-0-49917";"Verandis sent me to help. He said he needed to do some more research. I swear, the man's got his head buried in that old book you found in Lorkrata. But if it wasn't that, it'd be something else. He loves his research, that's for sure."
"165399380-0-49922";"Can't talk now. The pretty lady said it's sleepy time. Ssshhh!"
"165399380-0-49958";"Sit awhile if you wish. Speak your prayers. The wood will hear them. Y'ffre is there."
"165399380-0-49972";"Are those two still arguing like kittens?\n\nMinshur finds it quite difficult to enjoy his book with them prattling on in this way."
"165399380-0-49980";"Who are you? Where is my mother? She always brings the water to these falls!"
"165399380-0-50009";"I had hoped to save Lleraya from this fate. Or else, I should have been the one to end her campaign. I'm sorry this unfortunate task fell to you."
"165399380-0-50016";"I've heard a lot about you. Finally, we meet in person."
"165399380-0-50018";"Are you looking for the Captain? You will find her at the city's docks.\n\nShe said something about a 'great beauty' that she needed to see."
"165399380-0-50019";"This ship … she's impressive. Maybe someone will give her to me.\n\n""Commodore Jimila."" Ha! What do you think of that?"
"165399380-0-50022";"I'm surprised there's only one vessel. They must have been absolutely packed in here."
"165399380-0-50024";"It smells like boiled cabbage and feet in here.\n\nPirates."
"165399380-0-50037";"Ah, that look. So familiar. Your mouth is dry, your blood boils in your veins, while your skin turns cold as ice. \n\nYour body does not accept the blessing for what it is. It resists."
"165399380-0-50044";"The itching … it just won't stop!"
"165399380-0-50060";"Wood Elves … hmph. I serve my potions in the finest glass, and what do they do? They pour the tonics into their filthy deer bladders then cast the bottles aside! \n\nSavages!"
"165399380-0-50061";"I'll never feel right again."
"165399380-0-50066";"These Wood Elves have scads of leather, but bolts of fabric are few and far between. Makes a career in clothing quite an ordeal, let me tell you."
"165399380-0-50068";"I pity these High Elves tramping about in their metal pants. Leather and cloth are so much finer, don't you think? Of course you do.\n\nIs there anything I can help you with?"
"165399380-0-50070";"I get a lot of strange looks for my choice in armor. It requires some talent to imbue ebony with Daedric essence, you know.\n\nI consider it a point of pride. A mark of my trade, if you will."
"165399380-0-50084";"The raw destructive power imbued in a staff of quality is enough to make a difference on any battlefield.\n\nImagine: An entire army hurling bolts and blankets of fire, frost, or lightning. Majestic."
"165399380-0-50088";"Nobody makes bows like the Bosmer!\n\nNo, really. Nobody does. Everyone else cuts down trees, it's insane."
"165399380-0-50091";"Sorry, friend. I have no time to chat. One of my subordinates recently came across something very interesting. Something that could make our time in this dreadful land worthwhile."
"165399380-0-50096";"If you've come to work wood, I'd keep your wits about you. The locals stage protests now and again.\n\nIt's bizarre, but you get used to it."
"165399380-0-50187";"Please, get me out of here! I've changed! Please!"
"165399380-0-50189";"You! You did this to me! \n\nSai Sahan, my love … let me out, would you? I promise you an eternity of delights …"
"165399380-0-50193";"Since we've had more high elves and khajiit around, the food has gotten much more varied in Elden Root."
"165399380-0-50265";"What do you want with this old woman?"
"165399380-0-50298";"My heart goes out to Arzhela. I admire her strength in shouldering so much responsibility in the wake of so much tragedy.\n\nI look forward to seeing King Eamond and the children avenged."
"165399380-0-50443";"I'll tell ya, these Khajiit are tough on fabric. Mending claw-marks is a full-time job, but I still sell some goods on the side. Have a look."
"165399380-0-50444";"This one has many accounts to settle before the Moons rise and fall. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-50445";"You can trust this one implicitly. Or, if you do not trust her, trust the guards and their blades. What can I do for you?"
"165399380-0-50446";"We may be far from the front, soldier, but there's still much to do. Now, report!"
"165399380-0-50447";"I can tell, you've got brains and smarts both. Smarts enough to buy from me! So what do you need?"
"165399380-0-50490";"Greetings, walker! Rabamak has many spotless goods. You will come and look, yes?"
"165399380-0-50522";"If you want a horse, then we have something to talk about. If you want gossip, find the tavern."
"165399380-0-50616";"I've got all manner of guild goods here, readily available. Especially to one such as you."
"165399380-0-50625";"I have a delicate spell matrix in progress here. So please, speak quickly. I don't want to lose all this work."
"165399380-0-50626";"Many and many are the inner mysteries of Alchemy. If you seek to learn more, you are speaking with the right woman."
"165399380-0-50627";"Do not be fooled by my eggbrother's words. My goods are just as moist as his."
"165399380-0-50629";"Don't mind my friend. She's always looking for an excuse to tear down <<1>>."
"165399380-0-50637";"<<1>> wasn't garrisoned at <<2>> to protect it. The Dominion put her there to keep a boot beside our necks."
"165399380-0-50650";"<<1>> means well, this one is certain.\n\nPerhaps ""certain"" is too a strong word."
"165399380-0-50651";"I try to share my love of culture with friends. Some take to it better than others."
"165399380-0-50673";"I have no idea where the funds for these projects are going to come from, but it's my responsibility to find that funding.\n\nPerhaps I should reopen my family's salt mine."
"165399380-0-50679";"I ensure the reception and distribution of all Thalmor-requisitioned goods here in Elden Root.\n\nIf you don't mind, I must be about the day's inspections."
"165399380-0-50748";"I am doing my very best to reconcile the diverse culinary preferences of the Dominion.\n\nThe Khajiit prefer their food with moon-sugar, which doesn't respond well to the aging in Wood Elf meats. High Elves, of course, prefer neither. Impossible!"
"165399380-0-50756";"Oh, hello. I was just napping.\n\nIt's just the thing after a stout meal and a pitcher of warm jagga … a good nap."
"165399380-0-50761";"You want to know what happened to Falinesti? The real truth is, nobody has a clue!"
"165399380-0-50762";"Every Wood Elf thinks they have some special claim on the walking city of Falinesti. They don't, or they'd know where it went!"
"165399380-0-50763";"Such a shame, how the Argonians were treated. My friend has lived in <<1>> for decades. Will the Dominion think her a spy, too?"
"165399380-0-50764";"One grows used to the mistrust and suspicion, outside of the Black Marsh. I've learned to smile with my mouth closed. That usually helps."
"165399380-0-50768";"Long as you haven't come to take my things, you're welcome to loiter in my home for a bit.\n\nI'm a touch busy, I'm afraid. Probably won't make the best company."
"165399380-0-50839";"This one moves things into and out of the vault for Ahmussa. Speak to her for any banking business you have.\n\nShe keeps the records and logs. This one … he mostly forgets."
"165399380-0-50840";"My favorite thing about the Elden Tree is the gardens. They're cultivated, but also wild. The same plants you see elsewhere in <<1>>, but here kept safe from harm and disease.\n\nJust like pets. Except … plants. Plant pets?"
"165399380-0-50841";"I used to live down in the Middens. It's a hard place to stop living once you start—once you're down it's hard to get back up, right?\n\nSo, once I came into some money I got out of there. I can't go back. I just wish I could have brought my friends."
"165399380-0-50842";"The Thalmor asked me to do something with this plaza space. Ideally, I would use it for something that would appeal to the entire Dominion. Perhaps a monument?\n\nOr a tea house! I would prefer that."
"165399380-0-50857";"I've never experienced a carnival before. I think I need a moment to just appreciate it all. With all of the darkness in the world, it's nice to have something like this."
"165399380-0-50866";"It's good to see you!"
"165399380-0-50891";"Don't come too close!"
"165399380-0-50894";"Huh?"
"165399380-0-50914";"Freedom. Freedom at last! And Uela dead. Dead!"
"165399380-0-51047";"Zeht's tears, what a mess. It's a miracle that these laborers were even able to lift a pick, let alone meet Imperial Legionnaires in battle. \n\nWithout your help the losses would have been … catastrophic. You have our thanks."
"165399380-0-51052";"Well these Imperial louts weren't paid much, I can tell ya that. I've been rooting through their pockets for hours and all I've found is a wad of lint, a handful of drakes, and a half-eaten wedge of cheese."
"165399380-0-51053";"That runt on the left was called Fibias … the one on the right was named Marano. I always favored a sword in my old dog-fighting days—but I gotta tell ya, thumping those slavers to death with a mining pick was pretty damned satisfying."
"165399380-0-51065";"Greetings, warrior of the Dominion. Bask in the presence of this revered artifact."
"165399380-0-51066";"You are welcome here, soldier. Even more so if you've come to defend our Elder Scroll."
"165399380-0-51069";"Gaze upon the Elder Scroll if you must, but do not linger unless you are here to defend it."
"165399380-0-51078";"I was worried for a moment there. I gave you the antidote but then you passed out. I thought I mixed it wrong!"
"165399380-0-51086";"My brother Brendar went into the barrow last night and still hasn't returned. Do you think he's okay?"
"165399380-0-51088";"Thank Kyne someone came. I thought I'd die down here. I was surprised I even woke up at all. Did my sister send you to find me?"
"165399380-0-51089";"That mine was like a prison … worse than a prison. If I had my way, we'd throw those Imperials' bodies down the main shaft with a heap of firesalts and blow the whole damned thing to Oblivion."
"165399380-0-51121";"A small bottle of wine, a pair of boots, and some pickled hoarvor for the road … not so much to fret over, yes? So why the stockade? This one is just going to steal them back tomorrow, no?"
"165399380-0-51127";"The Wood Elves … aheh … they do not eat plants, yes? So where do they get their ale? Fermented milk!\n\nThey call it ""jagga,"" yes? Hearty, sweet, and it goes down smoothly! <<1>> could drink forever!"
"165399380-0-51128";"If the prices of moon-sugar were not so high, there is so much more this one could make. As it is, we must make do with what the Bosmer provide."
"165399380-0-51134";"You. You must reach my brother."
"165399380-0-51136";"You … you're not one of these cultists. Get me out of here."
"165399380-0-51137";"My friend, I'm so glad to see you!"
"165399380-0-51138";"Thank you again. I made sure to put myself in harm's way to protect my little brother. Unfortunately, he learned nothing and thinks I caused us to get caught. \n\nAh, youth."
"165399380-0-51155";"My … my friend. I never thought to see you again. Please, end me. Put me out of my misery one more time."
"165399380-0-51156";"Ah … my brother's keeper. Here to taunt me in death as you did in life?"
"165399380-0-51171";"Count Verandis is a kind and caring master. I am grateful for everything he's done for me."
"165399380-0-51189";"This business about the Covenant invasion makes you want to crawl in a hole and drink, don't it?"
"165399380-0-51190";"Arms for the war effort? I give you a special price. I wouldn't want you to think I profit from misfortune."
"165399380-0-51191";"Some put faith in the Divines, some put faith in the Tribunal. Me? I put faith in my armor is stronger than your sword."
"165399380-0-51193";"Yes, I make armor. It's nothing glamorous. Lots of sweat, lots of hard work. If you need supplies, I sell them."
"165399380-0-51194";"A little bit of this, a little bit of that. And maybe some of … no that's perfect.\n\nAlchemy is a delicate but rewarding art."
"165399380-0-51195";"You spend a lot of time thinking about weapons? About armor? Plenty do. They spend good coin on what they take into battle. But then they don't give a second look to the enchanter.\n\nMight as well charge into battle naked, I say."
"165399380-0-51196";"The way I see it, the world has a certain hierarchy. You've got your kings, your generals, and your blacksmiths. After all, what's a king or a general without a good weapon?"
"165399380-0-51197";"Have something you need to keep safe? This is the place. Best service in Tamriel, too."
"165399380-0-51198";"I won't pretend it's the best stock in Tamriel, but I'd trust my life to it, and you'll get no better guarantee anywhere."
"165399380-0-51203";"Crafting warm, sturdy clothing is the most important job on the island. Think you're up to it? I've got a few goods you might like. \n\nTake a look."
"165399380-0-51204";"Times like these, it pays to know the art of alchemy. Reagents are more dangerous to acquire, sure, but everyone wants potions. Very profitable."
"165399380-0-51205";"Pains me to think of leaving this place behind. But maybe it's time I did. The danger is too great."
"165399380-0-51206";"Take a load off. Our banks are the most secure places in all Tamriel. We pride ourselves on our services."
"165399380-0-51216";"<The horse eyes you nervously as if he's expecting to be beaten.>"
"165399380-0-51231";"Can't last much much longer …."
"165399380-0-51232";"Warn … warn <<1>> …."
"165399380-0-51233";"We're about to run a shipment back to Wayrest if you'd like to come aboard."
"165399380-0-51252";"I wanted to show the guard that I appreciate all they do for us. After giving it some thought, I decided to shore up their defenses instead."
"165399380-0-51255";"Why have we been visited with these disasters? Sometimes it feels like all of Rivenspire has been cursed."
"165399380-0-51256";"I'm writing a letter to my sister. Let her know what's been happening here in Rivenspire. Sometimes the town criers blow everything out of proportion."
"165399380-0-51257";"Now is not a good time, friend. I have a lot of thinking I need to do."
"165399380-0-51263";"My Lord … my Count … Your Highness? Oh, who cares? We don't need to stand on ceremony. Not us!\n\nMe and good old Verandis, showing the world how vampires are supposed to behave …."
"165399380-0-51270";"The people in this town aren't very welcoming."
"165399380-0-51271";"How may I be of assistance?"
"165399380-0-51283";"I keep hoping to see my wife or a few others from Crestshade coming this way.  I promised my wife I would not go back to town. I wish I hadn't made such a promise."
"165399380-0-51289";"Holding down the fort while you have all the fun? Remind me again why I volunteered for this mission.\n\nWell, don't get your robes in a bunch. I'll keep the way out clear of skeletons until you get back."
"165399380-0-51302";"Frost trolls, in <<1>>? The world has gone mad."
"165399380-0-51328";"I am praying for strength and courage. I should not be hiding from those foul creatures. Arkay watches over me, surely."
"165399380-0-51352";"In the springtime so fair, \nthe ladies sow the seed.\nWhen harvest rolls around,\nI'm still drinking mead …."
"165399380-0-51375";"My father was working here during Ranser's War. He disappeared and we never heard from him again.\n\nI've been looking forward to meeting this man Althen for a long time."
"165399380-0-51397";"Another one, eh? Come to gawk at Titus the Mad?\n\nWell, I'm not insane, no matter what you may have heard. And I might be your only hope to defeat the Anka-Ra."
"165399380-0-51417";"By the Eight … who did this? What happened to my people?"
"165399380-0-51420";"""Alchemist,"" they call me. My dear traveler, I am no mere alchemist—I'm a miracle worker!\n\nWhat do you need?"
"165399380-0-51423";"I'm positively enchanted to make your acquaintance. Ha! Get it? I … oh, never mind.\n\nWhat do you need today?"
"165399380-0-51424";"It's dangerous out there. Goblins, pirates, and beasts! What I've got here will keep you safe."
"165399380-0-51425";"Protect yourself! The armor I sell will keep your pretty skin intact."
"165399380-0-51427";"Don't let these meat-heads get to you. A good set of lightweight armor is worth every bit of effort you put into it."
"165399380-0-51429";"There's no steel better than Orc steel. What more do you need to know?"
"165399380-0-51430";"Come to try your hand at some alchemy? I started out as a brewer. Worked great for a while. But when my beer started turning people into mudcrabs, I figured it was time for a change."
"165399380-0-51431";"Think you're strong now? Give enchanting a try. A few soul gems and a bit of elbow grease is all it takes. You'll be arm-wrestling trolls in no time!"
"165399380-0-51436";"Without a well-crafted, carefully maintained weapon, you can end up as a meal for some wild animal. Or worse. All sorts of dangerous things out there, my friend."
"165399380-0-51440";"You can always buy armor, of course. But wearing pieces you made yourself will give you more confidence."
"165399380-0-51444";"Pointed metal pieces, or iron casings are all well and good, I suppose, for your common adventurer. But understanding the mysteries of enchantments? That is for the refined, well-traveled and intelligent adventurer."
"165399380-0-51447";"I love mixing different reagents, trying different things. Mind you, I've singed my fur a time or two with some unexpected results, but alchemy is for the adventurous, I always say."
"165399380-0-51449";"Perhaps I deserve this. The death, the suffering. I am to blame for this disaster.\n\nLock me up and throw away the key. I must pay for these crimes."
"165399380-0-51463";"Awake! The long eons of silence have finally come to an end.\n\nI speak in the coarse tongue of our servants so that you may understand. Knowledge is the key that opens this door, and none may pass who have not gained knowledge."
"165399380-0-51534";"Shor's bones, look at those sunken cheeks! You need a good meal and fast. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-51536";"Kyne curse those Daggers! They burned everything. Ten years ago I would have killed the lot of them before they stepped off the boat. Old age—bah! If you run into Holgunn, tell him to split an Orc at the shoulder for old Vestalgar."
"165399380-0-51538";"Bah! Off with you, troll bait! You're ruining the show!"
"165399380-0-51540";"Honor to you, sera. Welcome to the Watch House Inn. Those netch-brained Daggers won't trouble you here—I hope. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-51546";"I'm just going to ignore our farmyard neighbors at present and simply go on about guild business. The business of selling magical paraphernalia."
"165399380-0-51547";"As with all creatures, time brings change, and with change, wisdom.\n\nThe Mages Guild grew from the Psijjics, often held as the wisest of mages. Lord Sotha would grant them room to grow."
"165399380-0-51558";"I'd be happy to help with anything you may need.\n\nAs long as it's mystical, and you're paying."
"165399380-0-51578";"Not every Orc wants to wield a heavy mace or hammer. Some of us prefer the use of staves and other magic implements."
"165399380-0-51587";"Is there anything this humble perquisitor can get for you? Everything is ours, I swear. We would never knowingly distribute the temple's relics."
"165399380-0-51588";"Bah! I can't take this waiting any longer! If our regiment doesn't march on Cyrodiil soon, I'm going to rent a mule and ride there myself."
"165399380-0-51594";"Out traveling and exploring, are you? Let any evil-doer or riled up creature know you mean business with a finely-crafted and sharp blade!"
"165399380-0-51595";"We've been waiting on a troop of reservists for days now. At this rate the war for Cyrodiil will be over before we even get there."
"165399380-0-51601";"You look dry, my friend. Fancy a drink?"
"165399380-0-51700";"I thought for sure that dropping a mountain on top of you would turn you into a fine paste. Not sure how you got out of there, but I'm glad I was wrong."
"165399380-0-51705";"I'm glad the Light saw fit to guide you back to us, my friend. If not for you and Verandis, we all would have died in there.\n\nThe Count's name will be remembered. I promise you that."
"165399380-0-51715";"Got sturdy shields and long-range weapons. Safety first, right?"
"165399380-0-51787";"Have you come looking for a steed, friend? Fallen knights mean riderless horses! Misfortune for them means savings for you! Have a look at my stock."
"165399380-0-51800";"My mounts are bred strong to cross mountainous terrain. The Gold Coast Trading Company is one of my best customers. I'm also happy to take care of your animal, for a fair price."
"165399380-0-51805";"Welcome, friend! Don't believe my sister, over at Skywatch. I breed the best mares on the island. Just you see."
"165399380-0-51820";"I left my family back in Windhelm to come here. I hope I don't live to regret it."
"165399380-0-51821";"My horses are beauties! Look how they hold their heads up high.\n\nI treat my horses well, whether they belong to me or if they just happen to rent a stall in my stables."
"165399380-0-51823";"Hello. How may I be of service?"
"165399380-0-51836";"What? Haven't you ever seen a Wood Elf before? I know I'm still learning my trade, but the armor I craft isn't half bad.\n\nFor a Wood Elf."
"165399380-0-51917";"If you're heading into the White, you'll need some strong armor—heavier the better! \n\nJust shout if you see anything you like."
"165399380-0-52071";"It's strange. The Star-Gazers have been around in some form or another for a very long time. But no one really knows how they started."
"165399380-0-52075";"I've spent so much time on the water, it is dry land that seems to pitch beneath my feet.\n\nAll a matter of perspective anyway, is it not?"
"165399380-0-52083";"These beasts belong to the embassy staff. They are not for sale. So don't ask.\n\nOne of those little Bosmer creatures sells horses outside of the big tree. Assuming you can even afford one."
"165399380-0-52088";"These docks aren't all they once were."
"165399380-0-52089";"I'm pretty good with knives. I know how to fillet fish, butcher livestock. I can gut an enemy on the battlefield too, if I need to. But honestly, I prefer to cook."
"165399380-0-52109";"I'd be careful if you go in there to talk to poor Nuhran. He's … twisted.\n\nWhatever's happened to him, I … I just don't know."
"165399380-0-52221";"Do you mind?"
"165399380-0-52222";"Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to wait your turn, my lovely."
"165399380-0-52317";"They built that fort for a reason, friend. Why not buy some protection of your own?"
"165399380-0-52319";"I regret I can offer you no hospitality today. I lost my husband to the sea, and now I am alone and without so much as a half-gold piece to my name.\n\nBut if you care to stay and talk awhile, I would be grateful. My days and nights are so lonely now."
"165399380-0-52361";"<This soldier appears to have been killed recently, but his limbs are stiff and cold to the touch,  and the blood is frozen in his veins.>"
"165399380-0-52388";"You look a little dry, stranger. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-52407";"Why have you come here?"
"165399380-0-52425";"Hands to yourself or I chop—I mean, please refrain from touching anything. Please."
"165399380-0-52426";"Well met! Welcome to the Dead Wolf Inn! Not the most flattering name, I know. But at least you needn't worry about being mauled, right? Because the wolf is dead, you see …. Oh dear, that sounds awful. Let's just start over. \n\nHow can I help you?"
"165399380-0-52446";"This adventure is over, but another one awaits. Would you like to return to Raid Heaven and claim your rewards?"
"165399380-0-52732";"The Anka-Ra seem to be coming from burial sites like this one around Craglorn. \n\nThere is a ritual that can consecrate this ground for a time and keep the Anka-Ra from rising, but you must protect me while I perform it."
"165399380-0-52733";"The Anka-Ra seem to be coming from burial sites like this one around Craglorn. \n\nThere is a ritual that can consecrate this ground for a time and keep the Anka-Ra from rising, but you must protect me while I perform it."
"165399380-0-52763";"You are a friend of the queen, yes? Hazazi recognizes you from the sketch. Though this one thinks it may not do you much justice."
"165399380-0-52824";"Sometimes I can't even hear myself think, what with all the hustle and bustle at the temple. I can't expect the Three to hear us through all that noise and bother, so I came out here to pray for an end to all of Deshaan's troubles."
"165399380-0-52825";"Plenty of dangerous folk out there on the moors. The trick is to be the most dangerous one. I've got the tools if you've got the talent. Take a look."
"165399380-0-52826";"Come to look at my knives? Well, be careful. These aren't for buttering your bread."
"165399380-0-52828";"The squalls haven't been kind so my stock's a little thin. But what I've got is fresh as milk and roses!"
"165399380-0-52829";"Welcome to the Redfur Fighters Guild. Such as it is.\n\nI suppose you'd like to take a look at my stock?"
"165399380-0-52852";"Ah, you come to see what is on offer in Redfur. Even here, this one can procure useful things for mages. Have a look."
"165399380-0-52865";"We boast a unique Mages Guild hall, nestled here in the great tree."
"165399380-0-52933";"Hey! Hey you …. Don't tell my boss I'm here. I'm supposed to … I don't remember what I'm supposed to do. Damn. I hope it wasn't important."
"165399380-0-52952";"Poor, poor Monster. You didn't deserve this. It should have been me. I've had more than enough time, and you were always so strong and healthy."
"165399380-0-53041";"Welcome to the arena of Rahni'Za, initiate. This is a trial of stamina, strength, and teamwork. \n\nWhen you are ready to put your discipline to the test, give the command. Then I will commence the trial."
"165399380-0-53084";"<Incoherent mumbling>"
"165399380-0-53085";"Guh …."
"165399380-0-53087";"I did not think any beating heart would ever undertake these trials again. And you say you have come to avenge us? Hmm.\n\nI would help you, if I could. If these arms were more flesh than spirit. If I could grip steel and strike at the betrayer."
"165399380-0-53096";"I never dreamed that our avenger would arrive so soon. Thank you for defeating the betrayer. There's no saving the Sword-Disciples, but at least their spirits may find rest."
"165399380-0-53098";"The path to the final trial lies below. You will need to find the True Path through the darkness. It will lead you to Abelazar the betrayer. \n\nIf you would avenge us, this is the path you must take."
"165399380-0-53101";"Abelazar bested the Trial of Air like it was nothing. Like he had been born a bird and had spent his whole life flying.\n\nWe should have seen through him then."
"165399380-0-53103";"The story of the Wilderking has come to an end, and the story of the Wilderqueen has begun. \n\nFew Bosmer realize how fragile their relationship with the Valenwood really is, but you and I know. We've seen the sacrifice required to preserve it."
"165399380-0-53644";"Glad to see a friendly face. I've a few goods and extra cots prepared if you're in need of some rest. Just have a care walking around the injured."
"165399380-0-53682";"I truly enjoy my work. Creating graceful armor that protects you completely? It's very satisfying."
"165399380-0-53683";"I suppose you wish to see my fine gems? I don't stint on the quality of my stock. Prepare to be impressed."
"165399380-0-53684";"You carry many things. Small things, bigger things? You need to put them in something, yes?\n\nPunirai's Put-ins. Bags, to put things in!"
"165399380-0-53711";"Listen closely. You were right to help Titus. Had Tarish-Zi been able to gather his forces, there would have been nothing you could do to stop them."
"165399380-0-53736";"Have a look at my woven creations. There is no reason one can't look good while protected by light armor."
"165399380-0-53737";"Sure, sure. Steel and iron are fine for armor—if you want to make sure your enemies know you're nearby.\n\nBut leathers, tanned and treated, that's for those of us who prefer a more subtle approach."
"165399380-0-53800";"The alchemist's suppressant works wonders. I may not be cured, but I certainly feel much, much better."
"165399380-0-53806";"Sometimes soup really is the best medicine. Hot, tasty, and made with your own two hands! Well, not your hands. That would be disgusting."
"165399380-0-53808";"You look a little parched, friend. Perhaps I can assist you with that."
"165399380-0-53838";"I do not live here, nor do I intend to remain here.\n\nYour purchases will help ensure my future relocation to somewhere more… magical."
"165399380-0-53882";"Looking to wet your whiskers? This one thinks you've come to the right place."
"165399380-0-53885";"It's been difficult getting everything I usually stock, but so far I've managed. What I lack in selection, I make up for in bulk. So what can I get you?"
"165399380-0-53886";"No, I'm not worried. This will pass. Trouble comes and trouble goes. It's the way of the world."
"165399380-0-53888";"We're trying to clear as much room as we can for the refugees from Elinhir. I hear the destruction out that way is pretty bad."
"165399380-0-53889";"You look like you could use a strong drink. I know I could."
"165399380-0-53890";"My food was voted ""least likely to cause a stomach ache"" in a region-wide cooking competition. Lucky for you!"
"165399380-0-53891";"There's a lot of uncertainty in Belkarth these days, but you can rest assured we'll take good care of your valuables here."
"165399380-0-53893";"The Fighters Guild only recently arrived in Belkarth. We're here to help with the Celestial threat."
"165399380-0-53895";"I first came here because of my brother, Oscar. I had to make sure he stayed out of trouble."
"165399380-0-53905";"Gods walk with you, outsider."
"165399380-0-53909";"We didn't ask the Pact to come to our sacred refuge."
"165399380-0-53911";"Few remember the old ways or the Three Old Gods. But we try. We try."
"165399380-0-53992";"It … won't be long now. Even without the flowers, I'm glad we came. Being in this place … with Hartmin … this is how I want my final moments to be."
"165399380-0-54000";"They … they handed me over to the nereids. My own people!\n\nA sacrifice to Shada they called it. My life … I could feel it slipping away. I don't know how much longer I could have lasted."
"165399380-0-54001";"You are not Yokudan. You are their enemy. \n\nWhy are you here? How are you here?"
"165399380-0-54049";"It's about time! We sent a runner to Belkarth days ago!\n\nWait—you're not the reinforcements we requested, are you? Damn it."
"165399380-0-54151";"I sell armor crafted by the finest smiths in High Rock, Skyrim, and Hammerfell. Only the strongest plate and mail in my shop, that's for sure."
"165399380-0-54152";"Leather from Valenwood, metalwork from Skyrim, produced by the best crafters in Hammerfell."
"165399380-0-54153";"Yahiri's wares are sleek-fit and stitched to perfection. And do not worry—all my fabrics are troll-tested, so you can count on both style and safety, yes?"
"165399380-0-54155";"With all the mages here in Craglorn, you'd think business would be better."
"165399380-0-54186";"I have traveled to many places, seen many strange things. The discerning shopper appreciates my wares."
"165399380-0-54189";"My wife told me that I need to move more product, so I took the shields out of a crate and put them in a barrel. I don't know how that's supposed to help our business, but she's always been the brains in the family."
"165399380-0-54190";"They say the caves of Craglorn contain plants that don't grow anywhere else. I wouldn't recommend looking for them, though. Much too dangerous."
"165399380-0-54191";"Come for enchantments? By Tava's red feathers, you'll not find better."
"165399380-0-54192";"Working a huge stone forge on the second floor of a broken-down warehouse is dangerous, sure, but the gold's too good to pass up.\n\nCan I help—wait. Did you hear a creak? Please tell me you didn't hear a creak."
"165399380-0-54193";"Less fashion, more function—that's my motto. Don't get me wrong. I clean up all right. But a pretty shirt isn't worth a damn on a dead man."
"165399380-0-54194";"Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing with my life. My father wanted me to become a banker in Daggerfall. Instead, I'm in the middle of nowhere, selling backpacks to people with more armor than sense."
"165399380-0-54196";"The Mages Guild must guide the people of Craglorn through this difficult time. We will accept any aid offered."
"165399380-0-54228";"I worry about Hara. She's been working so hard since the Celestials appeared. I tell her she'll wear herself out, but she doesn't listen."
"165399380-0-54259";"This one roams, for this one knows: Those who themselves roam often have needs.\n\nAnd Mulabez, he satisfies these needs, yes?"
"165399380-0-54261";"What can I do for you? It pays to store your items in a bank vault, no matter what's happening in town."
"165399380-0-54262";"Shausa meets many travelers upon the road, and of all of them she asks one question.\n\nDo you need anything?"
"165399380-0-54264";"It's a hard life, traveling with your wares. I imagine that is why few do it."
"165399380-0-54265";"I love traveling this part of Valenwood. It's very different from the forests of Summerset, which I find both refreshing and pleasant.\n\nI often run across individuals in need of supplies, as well."
"165399380-0-54269";"Don't mind me! Just your average traveling peddler of sundries, I swear.\n\nI can prove it, too! Have a look at my wares, you'll see."
"165399380-0-54366";"This one believes that each piece of wood can have only one ideal use. As a woodworker, Splinter-Paws must find this ideal use. Only then can he create a useful object, and if it is the will of Jone and Jode, an object of lasting beauty."
"165399380-0-54369";"I stock only the freshest herbs and the finest spices. Let me know if you see anything you like."
"165399380-0-54370";"Quality leather goods here, at honest prices!"
"165399380-0-54371";"I have many quality items crafted of the finest woods in all of Tamriel. Would you like to peruse my inventory?"
"165399380-0-54372";"Mine is an honest profession. I'll take your measurements anew every time I see you. The rest of the world will size you up once and expect you to fit those measurements forever."
"165399380-0-54375";"This one thinks you have come to make a deposit, yes?"
"165399380-0-54389";"Well met, friend. Are you interested in the study of Alchemy?"
"165399380-0-54390";"Pulemu welcomes you, honored guest, and hopes she can be of service to you."
"165399380-0-54401";"Trading runs in my family, though I wish I had chosen a warmer climate to ply my trade. \n\nStill, business is good when there are soldiers camped nearby."
"165399380-0-54403";"I'm rather enjoying my stay in Fort Amol. Not every town I bring my wares to is so accommodating. Deldwine's Inn is very nice and there are lots of friendly soldiers."
"165399380-0-54404";"I know this is a bit of a rustic set-up, but I promise you, my armor is as good as any you will find in Windhelm."
"165399380-0-54410";"Will you say a prayer for those who have fallen behind the walls of Rahni'Za, the great school of blades?\n\nFor the great Sword-Disciples, who have been reduced to mindless thralls?"
"165399380-0-54413";"Someone around here needs to make sure work gets done—goods get sold. And it's usually me. Did you want to see my stock?"
"165399380-0-54439";"You mean there's not going to be a hostage exchange? \n\nDirt-eating liars! We'll kill you all and feed your remains to the seagulls!"
"165399380-0-54446";"Gods' mercy … what's going on? Why don't you just kill me …? To let me linger like this … it's wrong!\n\nWait. You're not one of them, are you? Where in Oblivion am I? Who … who are you?"
"165399380-0-54556";"This timber does not speak as the Hist does, but it does have a voice. Each branch begs for purpose—for meaning. You need only listen."
"165399380-0-54558";"Don't have many ingredients to work with here in Coldharbour. Ones that won't kill you I mean. But you're welcome to look over what I've got."
"165399380-0-54564";"Even with the alchemists camped here in the mill, I can still get plenty done.\n\nSpeaking of, need anything?"
"165399380-0-54566";"I handle the woodworking for the village here—most of it anyway. Anything I can help you with?"
"165399380-0-54567";"Bokeeus whispers secrets to the wood. Our craft requires trust as much as a steady hand, yes?"
"165399380-0-54571";"There's been a shift. Since the forming of the Pact. Dunmer are using more and more wood, less and less bone. I molded bone once. Things change."
"165399380-0-54572";"Getting your hands on proper woodworking materials in this swamp can be a nightmare.\n\nThat's why I'm here."
"165399380-0-54573";"You need something? If not, I've got wood to cut."
"165399380-0-54580";"I can't tell you how relieved I am to find you. I'm Ibrula—a friend of the Star-Gazers.\n\nI'm trying to gain entry to this temple, but the Celestial Warrior's army of Anka-Ra have sealed the door. I need help to get past them and disable the seals."
"165399380-0-54584";"Wanna know a secret? I'm a terrible woodworker. Can't plane a board to save my life. But you know what they say. Those who can, do; those who can't, sell!"
"165399380-0-54585";"This one assures you—none of the wood here violates the Green Pact.\n\nIf it did, we would not hear the end of it."
"165399380-0-54590";"Every port needs a gifted woodworker—especially if it's a proper naval yard. There's always work to be done, so let's make this quick, eh?"
"165399380-0-54592";"We have less trees here in the Reaper's March than many other places, so a fine carpenter is a rare and cherished thing. This one, he is a fine carpenter. \n\nWhat do you need?"
"165399380-0-54593";"Of course I am distressed over the recent incursion of Daedra here in Dune. But looking on the bright side, it is certainly going to increase demand for my services."
"165399380-0-54595";"Yeah, I work with this lot of rowdy Nords. It's a struggle, but an artist can't always pick where their materials come from, you know? Anyway, what can I get you?"
"165399380-0-54602";"Sanabi's stock is not the finest, but you cannot expect quality in a place such as this. We work with what we have."
"165399380-0-54627";"A well-made and carefully maintained weapon made from treated wood can last a lifetime. Or two!"
"165399380-0-54628";"I left the Grahtwood, because I have the gift of working with wood. Not a skill prized by many of my people."
"165399380-0-54637";"The city may fall, but the goblets must be saved. So says Shada.\n\nThe Yokudans will destroy everything if they gain this power."
"165399380-0-54647";"Please, do come in. Here at the Parchment and Horn, we do our best to ensure a relaxing stay for any journey to Marbruk. Even yours."
"165399380-0-54718";"I love the feel of smooth planks and the smell of sawdust. Making beautiful, durable wooden weapons is a useful skill to have."
"165399380-0-54735";"I never expected to end up in a place like this, let alone selling foodstuffs to any wanderer who passes by. Still, I like to be useful."
"165399380-0-54755";"Bah. The teeth on these saws are flatter than mine!\n\nAh, carpentry … It's a labor of love. Unrequited I'm afraid. What can I get you?"
"165399380-0-54756";"Fresh flavors! Exotic spices! A queen's bounty of flavor for the discerning cook! Come, have a look!"
"165399380-0-54776";"Woodworking takes patience, discipline, and absolutely everything I have for sale! Buy now because supplies are limited."
"165399380-0-54780";"I wasn't sure I would be able to ply my trade in Grahtwood, given how touchy some Wood Elves are about their trees. So far so good."
"165399380-0-54789";"I hate it here. I'd rather do my tailoring somewhere warmer and safer. Less remote."
"165399380-0-54790";"Can I interest you in anything?"
"165399380-0-54793";"Wooden wonders for sale. This is what I sell.\n\nYou will buy them, of course."
"165399380-0-54795";"Trust me when I tell you that none but an Argonian truly knows quality leather or hide. We live it, you know?"
"165399380-0-54796";"I weave fabrics while I meditate.\n\nI seem to do a great deal of meditation—after all, I have so many garments to sell!"
"165399380-0-54797";"Bark-Scraper does not understand this hate for fine woodcraft here in Elden Root. But then, the little walkers do many things that make no sense."
"165399380-0-54833";"The forests and fields of Greenshade are a treasure trove ingredients and foodstuffs. I forage and explore and always find something interesting."
"165399380-0-54851";"Care to lighten my load? It's a long way to where I'm going."
"165399380-0-54852";"I shouldn't have bought so much stock. Care to trade? I could use a lighter pack, and I'll give you a fair price!"
"165399380-0-54853";"The road is long. Best stock up while you can, eh? Never know when you'll have another chance!"
"165399380-0-54855";"I'd shake your hand but, y'know … wood sap. \n\nWhat can I get you?"
"165399380-0-54861";"Most Nords don't really appreciate the gift of magic or what I do.\n\nIncluding me. I'd rather be a lumberjack."
"165399380-0-54871";"You've come seeking power. I can see it in your eyes. Look on my wares. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for."
"165399380-0-54876";"Channeling arcane power is an art. You'll need soul gems if you wish to perfect it."
"165399380-0-54897";"Interested in creating your own plane meld?\n\nSorry. Bad joke."
"165399380-0-54901";"Do you see something you like?"
"165399380-0-54916";"Some of the other mages do not care for such rustic quarters, but I rather like it here. Stone buildings are too confining."
"165399380-0-54917";"Hail, O wayfarer. I must admit, I am uneasy around so many Orcs. But a carpenter must go where the wood is, yes?\n\nWhat can I help you with?"
"165399380-0-54979";"Sturdy, eye-catching clothes are a must for any true privateer. \n\nYou could buy some from the scoundrels here in town, but isn't it more satisfying to make your own?"
"165399380-0-54998";"It sure is a fine time to be a worker of wood. Plenty of good, strong wood to go around—and plenty of demand for it."
"165399380-0-55006";"I am quite sure my posting to this … backwater was a mistake. I am sure the situation will be rectified soon."
"165399380-0-55007";"You're in luck, I've recently re-stocked. Have a look."
"165399380-0-55009";"I must've upset someone high up in the guild to end up posted here. Ah well, things will change eventually. In the meantime, I still have some interesting items to show you."
"165399380-0-55044";"I don't remember why I came here, but I have every regret for doing so.\n\nIf I could move backwards through time, I would slap myself."
"165399380-0-55066";"Wood's hard to come by out in the Alik'r. You should stock up while you can."
"165399380-0-55069";"The wise cook knows that the secret to cooking is patience. And the right ingredients, of course.\n\nAs it happens, I have such ingredients, all for sale at fair prices."
"165399380-0-55079";"We have to import a fair amount of wood, but the warm sun and dry wind here cure it wonderfully."
"165399380-0-55110";"Well, well, well, look what the Khajiit dragged in. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-55128";"With the power of the Earth Forge, we can arm the Guild. Deal with any number of enemies!\n\nLucky for us we have Guildmaster Merric to lead us, eh?"
"165399380-0-55130";"The quality of the lumber here is wonderful!\n\nIt's been quite an asset for the Guild, I can tell you."
"165399380-0-55132";"If I may be of assistance, do let me know. Otherwise, I shall be occupying myself with my own duties here."
"165399380-0-55133";"Since Guildmaster Merric took over, our stores have been top quality!. If you should need anything, just ask comrade!"
"165399380-0-55146";"My dear friend, what did you get into? This is worse than moon-sugar withdraws."
"165399380-0-55148";"You must be from outside. I'm glad to see someone's noticed us.\n\nA word of advice, though. Don't drink the water in here. Don't even touch it."
"165399380-0-55157";"All the new faces in the Forge since Merric was made Guildmaster! \n\nIt's a boon for us grunts on the ground to have a seasoned veteran at the top. Can't wait to see what changes he makes!"
"165399380-0-55158";"Another day, another new Guildmaster. First the lizard, now the Redguard. I remember when there was a real Council, and the Guild was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHmph. Hope we return to that, someday."
"165399380-0-55159";"It's good to see a strong man of Alik'r leading the Guild! May Tall Papa guide his judgment, and the guild prosper forevermore!"
"165399380-0-55160";"You should know, not all of my people were like that snake Aelif. We of Elsweyr are the proud claws of the guild. We would never betray our comrades!"
"165399380-0-55161";"This Dwemer machinery is maddening. I'd love to repair some of it but … well. They didn't leave a lot of instructions behind."
"165399380-0-55163";"I wonder what Merric is up to. What he's thinking about … If he's thinking of me.\n\nHe's an impressive fellow, you know? But then, so are you."
"165399380-0-55165";"You're in luck, warrior. Whatever you need, I have it right here!"
"165399380-0-55221";"Please, help. I was with the research team that was sent to investigate this wing of the temple.\n\nThe others drank the water, but Nahlia and I refused to drink it. They attacked me, and then they captured Nahlia and took her deeper into the wing."
"165399380-0-55226";"Where do these undead keep coming from? Have you seen how they gather around the nereids? It's as if they're worshiping them.\n\nI wonder if that's what happens, eventually, when you drink the water. You start worshiping nereids and turn undead."
"165399380-0-55249";"The water. Don't drink the water.\n\nIt turns your mind. The nereids will control you. Shada will control you. She made us take Nahlia."
"165399380-0-55267";"I can't believe Klause and the others would have done this. This is all because of the water?"
"165399380-0-55268";"I don't know how I can repay you or Ralai for saving me. It was horrible. They captured me and handed me over to the Nereids. My life was being drained away.\n\nI don't know how much longer I could have lasted."
"165399380-0-55292";"I miss the soft-hearted cypress trees back home. These Craglorn maples are too rigid and creaky—like an old man's knees. But I ramble. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-55294";"Have you tried the local food? Bah! Bland as my auntie's ash tea. A true cuisinier needs what my wagon carries. Exotic flavors at rock-bottom prices!"
"165399380-0-55371";"Friend of the Star-Gazers. Look at this place. Here, the mages of Craglorn fended off the Prince of Schemes and his Dark Anchors.\n\nBut the sweet taste of victory quickly turned bitter."
"165399380-0-55375";"You there! You must set me free!"
"165399380-0-55378";"I thought I heard the tell-tale sounds of the living outside these doors.\n\nBe warned: the once-refreshing waters of this place run rancid with an unholy magic—a curse that grants great strength and unnatural long life, but for a price."
"165399380-0-55388";"How this fool ever possessed the power to control such mighty atronachs, I'll never understand."
"165399380-0-55405";"I don't know why the Serpent has bound the monarch atronachs like this. I'm not sure I want to know. He must have some purpose."
"165399380-0-55419";"The atronachs are bound to the gem of command. Use the gem on each focus stone to summon the atronachs. Then we may speak with them."
"165399380-0-55448";"I suppose I should thank you. I couldn't have bound the atronachs or defeated the air monarch on my own.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the end of the Serpent's mad plans, but I'd wager this sets him back for a while."
"165399380-0-55450";"Kelmen believes there is a fourth Atronach roaming Craglorn. Could this one have been created by the Serpent?"
"165399380-0-55452";"Between cities, it's usually just me on the road. Well, me, and the other idiots looking for a profit.\n\nSpeaking of profit … anything I can do for you?"
"165399380-0-55459";"Enjoy the fruits of the robust Stormhaven agricultural community!\n\nBuy your produce here!"
"165399380-0-55460";"The freshest produce and food stock of the fertile Deshaan plains, grown locally by only the finest of Dres plantations!"
"165399380-0-55613";"Things like this aren't supposed to happen in Elinhir. They just aren't."
"165399380-0-55614";"How did I fail to see this coming? It was my responsibility to protect them. The city was my responsibility."
"165399380-0-55621";"Ugh. No time for chatter. Too many wounded!"
"165399380-0-55625";"Of all the … oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
"165399380-0-55683";"Hara wanted me to stay with these Mage women to keep an eye on things. But I might have had a little too much wine …."
"165399380-0-55774";"This one has many accounts to settle before the Moons rise and fall. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-55775";"Your riches will be well looked after. I swear on my mother's egg-tooth."
"165399380-0-55776";"Now how did I know it was you who was helping the aspects?\n\nThey convinced me that they are what they say they are. The time has come to restore what was shattered and lost."
"165399380-0-55777";"May prosperity find you. You are here to make a deposit—is it not so?"
"165399380-0-55793";"You. I remember you, though we have not met. \n\nI am glad you arrived before the Scaled One. I believe this place is no longer safe."
"165399380-0-55803";"Fascinating creatures. Such uncomplicated lives. Kill or be killed. Consume or be consumed."
"165399380-0-55829";"The ruse is dropped, and the thief emerges from the shadows. You see the truth.\n\nForgive me. I wore the guise of Hara because I didn't know who to trust, but neither could I rest while the Serpent preyed on the other Guardians."
"165399380-0-55940";"The Scaled One craves magic. But you have stopped him from gathering it. For now."
"165399380-0-56108";"Yeah? Did the Dremora send you to finish me off?"
"165399380-0-56112";"While we have a moment, we should try to fortify our position. Find supplies throughout the district and bring them back here. If we get enough, we can upgrade our defenses."
"165399380-0-56177";"It's strange, all these people pouring into Belkarth. We used to be such a quiet town. \n\nWell, maybe not quiet. Just anonymous."
"165399380-0-56341";"If you're looking for the dumbest man in all of Cyrodiil, your search is over."
"165399380-0-56394";"How may I serve?"
"165399380-0-56434";"Many pursue the arcane arts, but few truly master them."
"165399380-0-56436";"Learn from your experiences."
"165399380-0-56687";"Wha … who are you? Flee, fool—before they come for you too!"
"165399380-0-56889";"What is it? You're one of them, aren't you? Traitor! Leave me to die in peace!"
"165399380-0-56988";"You fool! Flee this dungeon—get out! Leave now or you'll never see sunlight again."
"165399380-0-57021";"Another Daedra lover. So, it's my turn now?"
"165399380-0-57103";"Well, I'm glad to see you, no mistake. I'd rather have been rescued by Imperials, but you'll do."
"165399380-0-57474";"You and I have a common enemy; the Serpent and his Scaled Court. If you will stay your hand and hear what I have to say, I can offer you a unique opportunity to see this enemy slain.\n\nWill you listen to my offer?"
"165399380-0-57657";"Keep your head down! There's Dremora all over the place."
"165399380-0-57721";"Why are you here? This is my spot. Hurry, go away before they see you!"
"165399380-0-58636";"Hello there! Are you enjoying the festival?"
"165399380-0-58752";"This one has much to offer. From as far away as the Summerset Isles—enchanting and mystical!"
"165399380-0-58753";"My enchantments are the finest in the land. But quality has a cost my friend, quality has a cost."
"165399380-0-58754";"Anything can be made better through enchantment. Anything. Don't believe me? Give it a try."
"165399380-0-59194";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59195";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59197";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59198";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59199";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59200";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59219";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-59746";"I'm the receiver"
"165399380-0-59963";"I may be grateful for the help you provided me earlier, but you aren't one of us.\n\nFor your own good, stay out of this. Kurog will be the death of you, mark my words."
"165399380-0-59965";"You're one of Kurog's pet outsiders, aren't you?\n\nKurog has always had strange ideas, but I think he was drunk when he invited you here. From what I've seen, that's how he makes all his important decisions."
"165399380-0-59981";"Something catch your eye? Something hard to find? Something exotic?"
"165399380-0-59982";"Yes, yes. Finally, a discerning customer."
"165399380-0-59983";"Something I can help you with today? Feel free to browse and just holler if you need help."
"165399380-0-60353";"<The Scamp doesn't appear to be able to speak, but it does offer some basic services.>"
"165399380-0-60355";"I am starting this quest."
"165399380-0-60356";"You're on a layer, and when you turn in this quest, should remain on this layer with me."
"165399380-0-60503";"Have you seen my dogs? A horrible noise spooked one of them and all three ran off in different directions. They're my babies and I can't go on without them!"
"165399380-0-61132";"hi"
"165399380-0-61151";"yes, what is it?"
"165399380-0-61642";"You're not part of my expedition. Interesting. \n\nThis is no random chance. I believe you're the answer to our problem."
"165399380-0-61920";"You did a great thing this day. If you need anything, you can always find me here."
"165399380-0-63192";"When will they let us in the quarry again? This one has mouths to feed. No stone means no pay."
"165399380-0-64937";"Quiet! Can't you see I'm working here?"
"165399380-0-64949";"Get out of my face, outsider. You helped Bazrag, so I'm not inclined to knock out your teeth right now, but that could change at any moment."
"165399380-0-65080";"The captain wants a report. So I'm trying to figure out what happened here."
"165399380-0-65095";"A fool and his gold are soon parted, but you don't look foolish. We will keep your valuables safe and sound."
"165399380-0-65100";"You can rest assured we'll take good care of your valuables here."
"165399380-0-65101";"You may bank with me in complete confidence."
"165399380-0-65102";"You can trust our security and discretion."
"165399380-0-65103";"Time is gold, and today I have a short supply of both. Do you need something?"
"165399380-0-65104";"This one has many accounts to settle before the Moons rise and fall. What do you need?"
"165399380-0-65105";"Your riches will be well looked after. I swear on my mother's egg-tooth."
"165399380-0-65106";"Auri-el knows, I'm here to serve. What can I help you with?"
"165399380-0-65107";"Take it from me: your goods are safe here."
"165399380-0-65108";"Once you ask us to store an item of yours, our guarantee is that nobody will ever touch it again.\n\nExcept for you. Usually."
"165399380-0-65109";"Welcome. Shall I attend to your account?"
"165399380-0-65111";"Greetings, my friend. You've come to make a deposit, yes?"
"165399380-0-65112";"A secure vault makes for a confident heart."
"165399380-0-65113";"This one thinks you have come to make a deposit, yes?"
"165399380-0-65114";"Your purse looks heavy, wayfarer. Can we help safeguard your valuables?"
"165399380-0-65229";"Your timely arrival was a blessing from Trinimac, outsider!\n\nThe forge-mother promises that our temple will never again be a target for hatred and persecution. Next time, we'll be prepared!"
"165399380-0-65233";"<This frozen Orc wears an ornate bracer on one raised wrist.>"
"165399380-0-65765";"<This cultist and his uniform are too badly mangled to be of any use.>"
"165399380-0-65873";"A pox upon me! I didn't think I'd survive to tell me tale to another living soul!"
"165399380-0-66008";"I … I'm trying to look heroic. Is it working, do you think? Is Eveli looking this way?"
"165399380-0-66211";"I surrender! I surrender!\n\nYou killed some of our best soldiers. I know when I'm outmatched."
"165399380-0-66217";"How could something like this happen? We just wanted to spread the word of Trinimac, not start a civil war."
"165399380-0-66221";"Am I glad to see you!\n\nI was about to start putting arrows into the soldiers when you showed up. No way was I going to let them get close to the high priestess!"
"165399380-0-66411";"Is there something I can do for you?"
"165399380-0-66424";"<The harpies killed the merchant, but you find an official-looking document tucked within her robes.>"
"165399380-0-66605";"The clans, you earned their respect by what you did in there.\n\nFollow me. I can lead you back to the keep. The path should be safe enough now."
"165399380-0-66728";"I knew this mountain was going to be the death of us."
"165399380-0-66948";"Greetings. I'm sorry, I was looking for someone. I'll take my leave."
"165399380-0-67154";"Did you see that guy just now? Ran by without so much as a ""by your leave."" He's going to hurt someone."
"165399380-0-67156";"The next fool to run into me is going to get a sound beating! Plowed into me like an angry echatere and ran right up those stairs."
"165399380-0-67157";"I thought things would improve as the city neared completion, but what do we get? Rude and impatient hooligans running hither and yon!\n\nThis is why we can't have nice things. I hope a guard beats his head in."
"165399380-0-67158";"Orcs should know better than to run wildly past the Mages Guild. What if I had been in the midst of casting a spell? He could have been turned into a chicken and it would have served him right!\n\nHe went up those stairs like his arse was on fire!"
"165399380-0-67174";"Please, I need your help. The priests inside the temple are at the mercy of these … fanatics! Please, I think they want to kill my brothers and sisters in Trinimac!"
"165399380-0-67232";"<This man looks like he was only recently killed.>"
"165399380-0-67376";"No one's allowed on the ramparts. Not unless they're a soldier or a guard.\n\nAnd you don't look anything like a soldier or a guard, do you?"
"165399380-0-67455";"Greetings champion. Thank you for returning me to my prince."
"165399380-0-67523";"Come, come! Our goods are clearly lonely. Come and spend some time, and also money. Spend the money first."
"165399380-0-67595";"Such a sad and dismal day. But Rigurt knows how to fix that! I have most excellent Nord gifts for everyone!\n\nNo face can stay sad when it has one of Rigurt's most excellent gifts in its mouth!"
"165399380-0-67598";"If anyone asks, just tell them that you know us.\n\nWhat? It's research! How often do we get to attend a king's funeral and coronation?"
"165399380-0-67599";"Kireth's plan worked, just like she said it would. I'm really quite surprised.\n\n""Just walk in and act like we belong,"" she said. They even handed me a drink! I can't remember when I had such fun."
"165399380-0-67628";"Greetings, Vestige.  Though, I can hardly call you that anymore, can I? Let us say, Meridia's Champion, the Hero of Coldharbour, the Savior of Tamriel."
"165399380-0-68587";"<An outfit available to wear at the wedding.>"
"165399380-0-68588";"<An outfit available to wear at the wedding.>"
"165399380-0-68590";"<An outfit available to wear at the wedding.>"
"165399380-0-68592";"<An outfit available to wear at the wedding.>"
"165399380-0-68822";"<This emaciated corpse is covered in welts, but there are no obvious mortal wounds. The insides of the nostrils, mouth, and ears are coated in soot.>"
"165399380-0-70195";"Well hello there."
"165399380-0-72122";"I am sorry I misled you. I really thought that Tsatva had been taken. Foolish sentiment, yeah? Not a mistake I'll make again, trust me."
"165399380-0-72148";"Another one, eh? Come to gawk at Titus the Mad?\n\nWell, I'm not insane, no matter what you may have heard. And I might be your only hope to defeat the Anka-Ra."
"165399380-0-72163";"My mounts are bred strong to cross mountainous terrain. The Gold Coast Trading Company is one of my best customers. I'm also happy to take care of your animal, for a fair price."
"165399380-0-72173";"It's good you've arrived. You should talk to Hara, if you haven't already."
"165399380-0-72177";"It's strange. The Star-Gazers have been around in some form or another for a very long time. But no one really knows how they started."
"165399380-0-72209";"The Anka-Ra seem to be coming from burial sites like this one around Craglorn. \n\nThere is a ritual that can consecrate this ground for a time and keep the Anka-Ra from rising, but you must protect me while I perform it."
"165399380-0-72210";"The Anka-Ra seem to be coming from burial sites like this one around Craglorn. \n\nThere is a ritual that can consecrate this ground for a time and keep the Anka-Ra from rising, but you must protect me while I perform it."
"165399380-0-72259";"There's a rumor going around that the most recent grand melee was won by an unarmed and unarmored Imperial! \n\nHard to believe. Especially when others add that he also appeared seemingly out of nowhere. Sounds like magical trickery to me."
"165399380-0-72260";"Welcome to the arena of Rahni'Za, initiate. This is a trial of stamina, strength, and teamwork. \n\nWhen you are ready to put your discipline to the test, give the command. Then I will commence the trial."
"165399380-0-72267";"I did not think any beating heart would ever undertake these trials again. And you say you have come to avenge us? Hmm.\n\nI would help you, if I could. If these arms were more flesh than spirit. If I could grip steel and strike at the betrayer."
"165399380-0-72271";"I never dreamed that our avenger would arrive so soon. Thank you for defeating the betrayer. There's no saving the Sword-Disciples, but at least their spirits may find rest."
"165399380-0-72272";"The path to the final trial lies below. You will need to find the True Path through the darkness. It will lead you to Abelazar the betrayer. \n\nIf you would avenge us, this is the path you must take."
"165399380-0-72273";"Abelazar bested the Trial of Air like it was nothing. Like he had been born a bird and had spent his whole life flying.\n\nWe should have seen through him then."
"165399380-0-72313";"Listen closely. You were right to help Titus. Had Tarish-Zi been able to gather his forces, there would have been nothing you could do to stop them."
"165399380-0-72333";"It's been difficult getting everything I usually stock, but so far I've managed. What I lack in selection, I make up for in bulk. So what can I get you?"
"165399380-0-72334";"No, I'm not worried. This will pass. Trouble comes and trouble goes. It's the way of the world."
"165399380-0-72335";"We're trying to clear as much room as we can for the refugees from Elinhir. I hear the destruction out that way is pretty bad."
"165399380-0-72336";"You look like you could use a strong drink. I know I could."
"165399380-0-72337";"My food was voted ""least likely to cause a stomach ache"" in a region-wide cooking competition. Lucky for you!"
"165399380-0-72338";"There's a lot of uncertainty in Belkarth these days, but you can rest assured we'll take good care of your valuables here."
"165399380-0-72339";"The Orcs of the Dragontail Mountains were powerful allies in the fight against the Daedra, but now something's driving them from their lands and into ours."
"165399380-0-72340";"The Fighters Guild only recently arrived in Belkarth. We're here to help with the Celestial threat."
"165399380-0-72341";"The Mages Guild isn't very popular here in Craglorn. The last time we were here, our representative was tied to the back of a horse and run out of Elinhir. And that was merciful compared to what happened to the others."
"165399380-0-72342";"I first came here because of my brother, Oscar. I had to make sure he stayed out of trouble."
"165399380-0-72363";"They … they handed me over to the Nereids. My own people!\n\nA sacrifice to Shada they called it. My life … I could feel it slipping away. I don't know how much longer I could have lasted."
"165399380-0-72364";"You are not Yokudan. You are their enemy. \n\nWhy are you here? How are you here?"
"165399380-0-72373";"I sell armor crafted by the finest smiths in High Rock, Skyrim, and Hammerfell. Only the strongest plate and mail in my shop, that's for sure."
"165399380-0-72374";"Leather from Valenwood, metalwork from Skyrim, produced by the best crafters in Hammerfell."
"165399380-0-72376";"With all the mages here in Craglorn, you'd think business would be better."
"165399380-0-72383";"Don't bother haggling. I can't control the prices. Supply and demand, you see."
"165399380-0-72384";"My wife told me that I need to move more product, so I took the shields out of a crate and put them in a barrel. I don't know how that's supposed to help our business, but she's always been the brains in the family."
"165399380-0-72385";"They say the caves of Craglorn contain plants that don't grow anywhere else. I wouldn't recommend looking for them, though. Much too dangerous."
"165399380-0-72386";"Come for enchantments? By Tava's red feathers, you'll not find better."
"165399380-0-72387";"Working a huge stone forge on the second floor of a broken-down warehouse is dangerous, sure, but the gold's too good to pass up.\n\nCan I help—wait. Did you hear a creak? Please tell me you didn't hear a creak."
"165399380-0-72388";"Less fashion, more function—that's my motto. Don't get me wrong. I clean up all right. But a pretty shirt isn't worth a damn on a dead man."
"165399380-0-72389";"Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing with my life. My father wanted me to become a banker in Daggerfall. Instead, I'm in the middle of nowhere, selling backpacks to people with more armor than sense."
"165399380-0-72391";"The Mages Guild must guide the people of Craglorn through this difficult time. We will accept any aid offered."
"165399380-0-72403";"That's the third caravan this week. Besides what's happening at Elinhir and the giant crater outside, we'll be out of business by the end of the year."
"165399380-0-72405";"It may just be my imagination, but it feels cold and dark now that the stars have fallen from the sky."
"165399380-0-72406";"I worry about Hara. She's been working so hard since the Celestials appeared. I tell her she'll wear herself out, but she doesn't listen."
"165399380-0-72436";"Will you say a prayer for those who have fallen behind the walls of Rahni'Za, the great school of blades?\n\nFor the great Sword-Disciples, who have been reduced to mindless thralls?"
"165399380-0-72469";"I can't tell you how relieved I am to find you. I'm Ibrula—a friend of the Star-Gazers.\n\nI'm trying to gain entry to this temple, but the Celestial Warrior's army of Anka-Ra have sealed the door. I need help to get past them and disable the seals."
"165399380-0-72504";"Only the most skilled warriors earn the right to study under the Sword-Disciples of Rahni'Za.\n\nThe Trial of Fire is the test that separates the worthy from the unworthy . With its completion, you begin your first step into our school."
"165399380-0-72536";"I hear you've come to help, and let me tell you, we're all grateful."
"165399380-0-72538";"Shada will destroy you … she'll destroy you all!\n\nShe's going to save us. She'll do anything to save us."
"165399380-0-72539";"My dear friend, what did you get into? This is worse than moon-sugar withdraws."
"165399380-0-72541";"You must be from outside. I'm glad to see someone's noticed us.\n\nA word of advice, though. Don't drink the water in here. Don't even touch it."
"165399380-0-72554";"Please, help. I was with the research team that was sent to investigate this wing of the temple.\n\nThe others drank the water, but Nahlia and I refused to drink it. They attacked me, and then they captured Nahlia and took her deeper into the wing."
"165399380-0-72556";"Where do these undead keep coming from? Have you seen how they gather around the Nereids? It's as if they're worshiping them.\n\nI wonder if that's what happens, eventually, when you drink the water. You start worshiping Nereids and turn undead."
"165399380-0-72562";"What did we do? Nahlia—she's going to be used in the sacrifice. The waters turned us against our own people."
"165399380-0-72563";"The water. Don't drink the water.\n\nIt turns your mind. The Nereids will control you. Shada will control you. She made us take Nahlia."
"165399380-0-72566";"It's over. Thank you. \n\nWe took Nahlia. You have to save her. I hope it's not too late."
"165399380-0-72580";"I can't believe Klause and the others would have done this. This is all because of the water?"
"165399380-0-72590";"I miss the soft-hearted cypress trees back home. These Craglorn maples are too rigid and creaky—like an old man's knees. But I ramble. How can I help you?"
"165399380-0-72591";"Have you tried the local food? Bah! Bland as my auntie's ash tea. A true cuisinier needs what my wagon carries. Exotic flavors at rock-bottom prices!"
"165399380-0-72626";"Friend of the Star-Gazers. Look at this place. Here, the mages of Craglorn fended off the Prince of Schemes and his Dark Anchors.\n\nBut the sweet taste of victory quickly turned bitter."
"165399380-0-72627";"You there! You must set me free!"
"165399380-0-72629";"I thought I heard the tell-tale sounds of the living outside these doors.\n\nBe warned: the once-refreshing waters of this place run rancid with an unholy magic—a curse that grants great strength and unnatural long life, but for a price."
"165399380-0-72637";"How this fool ever possessed the power to control such mighty atronachs, I'll never understand."
"165399380-0-72653";"The atronachs are bound to the gem of command. Use the gem on each focus stone to summon the atronachs. Then we may speak with them."
"165399380-0-72663";"I suppose I should thank you. I couldn't have bound the atronachs or defeated the air monarch on my own.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the end of the Serpent's mad plans, but I'd wager this sets him back for a while."
"165399380-0-72664";"Kelmen believes there is a fourth Atronach roaming Craglorn. Could this one have been created by the Serpent?"
"165399380-0-72672";"That flesh abomination killed thousands of Yokudans as they assaulted this place. That you took it down so easily—could Zal'ik's magic be weakening?\n\nIn any case, the cloud of poison has begun to move."
"165399380-0-72695";"Folks said I was mad to build a huge stone forge on the second floor of a rickety warehouse. I did it, anyway! Sure, you might get crushed in a fiery collapse, but you can't beat the view!"
"165399380-0-72697";"Such terrible times these are. At least we are safe here in Belkarth.\n\nI heard that Elinhir did not fare so well. In fact, I hear that the entire Eastern portion of Craglorn is overrun with atronachs."
"165399380-0-72698";"This one thinks the Star-Gazers should spend less time looking at stars and more time gazing down here. Walkers starve while they shuffle around in their silly robes, comfortable in their observatory. Ziss on them!"
"165399380-0-72699";"Quite an impressive library for some paltry inn, eh? I haven't seen many Dragonstar thugs or traders up here for story time, though. Damn odd, that."
"165399380-0-72700";"Keep it nice and orderly. And if you see anything suspicious, let me know."
"165399380-0-72701";"Can't you see I'm eating? Off with you, troll-bait."
"165399380-0-72703";"This can't be happening! The mages haven't turned against us. They wouldn't! This is … just a silly nightmare isn't it? I'm going to wake up and my Itinia will still be alive …."
"165399380-0-72705";"What do you want? This one has gold! Jewels! Slaves! Riches beyond your wildest fantasies! Release me and this one will make you wealthier than anyone in Tamriel!"
"165399380-0-72706";"I demand that you release me at once! Do you have any idea who I am? You'll regret this injustice for the rest of your short life!"
"165399380-0-72707";"Well, my situation can't get any worse … so now it can only get better! Onwards and upwards!"
"165399380-0-72708";"All my friends have gone mad. The town is in ruins. What's going to happen to me?"
"165399380-0-72724";"Things like this aren't supposed to happen in Elinhir. They just aren't."
"165399380-0-72725";"How did I fail to see this coming? It was my responsibility to protect them. The city was my responsibility."
"165399380-0-72726";"Behave yourself. These people have suffered enough. I won't let any more harm come to them."
"165399380-0-72727";"Did you hear that? Spellfiends, howling in the tunnels. Terrible sound."
"165399380-0-72728";"No mage is going to get the better of me."
"165399380-0-72729";"Good luck out there."
"165399380-0-72730";"I've been waiting days for a reputable escort to Evermore. Nothing but low-born hooligans and toothless drovers in this Eight-forsaken place. I'll not have my things handled by such people."
"165399380-0-72731";"Ugh. No time for chatter. Too many wounded!"
"165399380-0-72735";"Of all the … oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
"165399380-0-72746";"I studied at the mage school for a little while. In the healing arts. I did not think they would turn against us."
"165399380-0-72755";"There's nothing left. It's all gone."
"165399380-0-72756";"If it weren't for Minerva, we'd all be dead."
"165399380-0-72757";"How long do we have to hide in this sewer? We should arm ourselves and kill them all!"
"165399380-0-72758";"What if Minerva isn't really on our side? What if she's just gathered us here to kill us?"
"165399380-0-72766";"My father always said it was a mistake, handing control of Elinhir over to the mages."
"165399380-0-72768";"Gone. Everything's gone."
"165399380-0-72778";"Hara wanted me to stay with these Mage women to keep an eye on things. But I might have had a little too much wine …."
"165399380-0-72785";"I trust that you've come to harass us like the others. Let me save you the effort. Until such time as we're physically removed, we will remain here to conduct our research. Now begone."
"165399380-0-72796";"Now how did I know it was you who was helping the aspects?\n\nThey convinced me that they are what they say they are. The time has come to restore what was shattered and lost."
"165399380-0-72803";"You. I remember you, though we have not met. \n\nI am glad you arrived before the Scaled One. I believe this place is no longer safe."
"165399380-0-72809";"Fascinating creatures. Such uncomplicated lives. Kill or be killed. Consume or be consumed."
"165399380-0-72820";"Halt. This mile gate is a restricted area. Only members of the Covenant will be granted passage. Now be about your business."
"165399380-0-72821";"You want something? Go talk to the lieutenant. I got a lot on my mind. Strategy, you see? So take off."
"165399380-0-72824";"The ruse is dropped, and the thief emerges from the shadows. You see the truth.\n\nForgive me. I wore the guise of Hara because I didn't know who to trust, but neither could I rest while the Serpent preyed on the other Guardians."
"165399380-0-72835";"Here to join up? We're offering decent pay for a hard day's work. And with this much rock to move … well … there's plenty of job security."
"165399380-0-72853";"The Scaled One craves magic. But you have stopped him from gathering it. For now."
"165399380-0-72866";"Antonia Gratas. Sixth Legion ahorse. \n\nI have some items you might find useful. Purchase something or be on your way."
"165399380-0-72867";"Greetings, walker! You mean to enter the Seeker's Archive, yes? This one thinks you have the brains of a ja'khajiit. That is good! Crazy people need my goods most of all!"
"165399380-0-72868";"Careful. There are dangerous doings in Elinhir. I'd prefer to run for the hills, but we can't very well move the farm, can we? Zenithar preserve us.\n\nBut enough blather. Do you need supplies?"
"165399380-0-72869";"Headed up to Rahni'Za? Hope you enjoy boring lectures. Me? I prefer a merchant's life. The open road. Exotic locales. And happy customers!"
"165399380-0-72895";"It's strange. The longer I spend here, the more clouded my mind becomes. Memories that to me are only days gone are becoming as fleeting as a dream. I suppose at least there is comfort that you aided me in stopping Tarish-Zi before it was too late."
"165399380-0-72898";"It's strange, all these people pouring into Belkarth. We used to be such a quiet town. \n\nWell, maybe not quiet. Just anonymous."
"165399380-0-72903";"Mauloch gnash it! Of all the damned tuskless, ogre-brained …. Argh!\n\nWhat do you want?"
"165399380-0-72909";"I knew settling near the city would eventually lead to trouble, but Alarice just had to live close to her mother. Now we've got giant monsters running wild in our garden. \n\nI guess it puts a visit from the in-laws into perspective."
"165399380-0-72911";"If those mages want this farm, they're going to have to come and take it."
"165399380-0-72912";"Keep your head down. It is not safe here."
"165399380-0-72913";"Have you come to slay Iron Orcs? If so, give this one a wide berth. What I do will be … messy."
"165399380-0-72914";"Get out of here. No telling when they'll come back."
"165399380-0-72917";"Those aren't Orcs, they're monsters! Mauloch help us!"
"165399380-0-72920";"They call it liquid courage. I'm not sure that's the right name. More like liquid forgetfulness.\n\nA toast—to our dear, lost friends. And to the Thief, whatever she may be."
"165399380-0-72973";"Who are you? You've got to get away! It's not safe. Run … run while you can."
"165399380-0-73112";"You and I have a common enemy; the Serpent and his Scaled Court. If you will stay your hand and hear what I have to say, I can offer you a unique opportunity to see this enemy slain.\n\nWill you listen to my offer?"
"165399380-0-73327";"<Holstagg ignores everything around him.>"
"165399380-0-73334";"You're not a Stone-Fish. State your business or move along, if you please."
"165399380-0-73336";"Every life is a battle waiting to unfold."
"165399380-0-73345";"Come to spit on us like the rest of these thugs? I'll tell you what I told the others. We're here to compete in the Arena, nothing more."
"165399380-0-73487";"Please, leave Holstagg be. He's had a trying day."
"165399380-0-73528";"Thanks for the delivery."
"165399380-0-73660";"I erect the spine of welcome."
"165399380-0-73944";"Pacrooti welcomes you! So much of his business is carried out through couriers, it is nice to finally place names with faces!"
"165399380-0-74667";"<The ominous shadow belongs to a tiny spider feasting upon a long-dead Scamp. Neither poses any threat whatsoever.>"
"165399380-0-74874";"None of us is getting any younger, you know."
"165399380-0-75714";"<The miner only hums a simple melody when you speak to them.>\n\nTEMP: (For Puzzle - Hammer, Wolf, Torch, Torch, Owl)"
"165399380-0-75810";"Halt!"
"165399380-0-78762";"The fabricant hums happily when you pet it."
"165399380-0-80183";"Slag it, I still feel like I should be doing something to help."
"165399380-0-80184";"We must remain rational until we know more."
"165399380-0-80195";"How could an enemy slip right under our noses?"
"165399380-0-80305";"Only a select few are allowed to join the Sapiarchs. They only accept mages of exceptional skill and quality to join their ranks. Why, to even be put under consideration is near impossible for most."
"165399380-0-80323";"So this is the city of Lillandril, huh? It is certainly breathtaking. Not as much glowing as I imagined, but still. Wow."
"165399380-0-80409";"The factotums didn't even flinch at the alarm. Just going about their duties. I aspire to such efficiency."
"165399380-0-80410";"I don't buy it. It would take an army to break into the Cogitum Centralis, and we've seen no sign of attack. Probably a wayward skeevaton clogging the vents again."
"165399380-0-81832";"<The corpse of this Leimenid is covered in pus and rotting flesh. It appears that she's been infected with the cult's disease.>"
"165399380-0-82482";"I'm sorry, have we ever met? Do I know you? I'm quite bad with faces, I'm afraid."
"165399380-0-82884";"This may sound a little strange, but do you mind helping me out?\n\nI've written a play, you see, but I'm too embarrassed to show it to anyone yet. Would you mind running some lines with me? Just so I can get a feel for it?"
"165399380-0-82896";"Tell me something, traveler. What do you think of that bard over there?"
"165399380-0-82979";"Welcome to Rellenthil Greenhouses. Is there something I can help you with?"
"165399380-0-83080";"The Ceporah Tower truly is a sight to behold, isn't it? I've actually done quite a bit of research on its origins, if you have any questions."
"165399380-0-83176";"So you really beat a Daedric Prince? Unbelievable.\n\nMakes being an ambassador seem a bit dull in comparison. Not that I'm not proud of my work, of course. But perhaps a battle or two is overdue. My axe arm is feeling a tad rusty."
"165399380-0-84043";"I've had a lot of time to reflect on my actions in Shimmerene. To truly see how I let my prejudice blind me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still not pleased that we've opened our borders. But if my home is changing, then so must I."
"165399380-0-84046";"My, my, I have heard such tales about you. Would you consider giving the troupe rights to your story? I've always thought I'd make a rather good Nocturnal.\n\nAh, but now is not the time for such talk. Be merry, my little sneak. You deserve it!"
"165399380-0-84047";"Good work, soldier. You've done a great deal for the citizens of this island."
"165399380-0-84048";"It was hatred that changed my son. Hate of the new. Hate of those different from us.\n\nAnd here you are, a newcomer. The very reason we're all still alive. I hope your actions change the minds of many others, before they too take the wrong path."
"165399380-0-84049";"Only someone truly amazing would be able to change a Sapiarch's mind. Of course, from what I've seen, you were certainly the right candidate.\n\nI just hope the Mages Guild is allowed to participate in the tower's protection."
"165399380-0-86766";"Is that a heroic silhouette I spy?"
"165399380-0-91889";"Now that the corruption has gone, we can come back to marvel at the words of our loved ones, their final works that paint the whorl of their lives.\n\nGo, stranger, look upon the Wall of Life, feel the brush strokes of those who came before you."
"165399380-0-91890";"You have banished the corruption from our Wall of Life? Then you are worthy of the respect we bestow upon this sacred place.\n\nI come now to see young Vijari-ma off to the peaceful arms of Khenarthi, and to read once again the words of my ancestors."
"165399380-0-91891";"Mother Yalusara raised me. She had no children of her own, but after her husband died, she took in troubled orphans such as this one.\n\nShe was strict, but fair. When she made her passage here so many Moons ago, many of her children gathered to mourn."
"165399380-0-99627";"Want to collect stuff?"
"165399380-0-102571";"<Ghalor's eyes are vacant. He's oblivious to the world.>"
"165399380-0-103147";"Summerset Isle—our ancestral home and the primary seat of power for the High Elves."
"165399380-0-108706";"Don't worry, she will be fine after some rest."
