Fissure explosions will damage the Antiquity, regardless of its location in the dig site. However, any Antiquity directly struck by a Fissure's explosion will automatically break, resulting in a failed excavation.\n\nNOTE: Upgrading the Trowel, will allow you to selectively detonate fissures, converting them from a hazard to a dirt-clearing boon!"
"155022052-0-287";"Now that you've chosen an Antiquity to seek, you'll need to Scry for its location.\n\nClaim facets that are adjacent to the facets you already control, beginning at the large crystal found at the bottom of the Eye. Carefully select additional facets to reach the glowing Foci!"
"155022052-0-288";"You claimed a Foci! These special facets help you narrow your search.

"155022052-0-289";"You unlocked Coalescence! While Scrying, use this skill to select a hexagonal cluster of facets. All facets in the cluster will magically change to match the facet at the center.\n\nUse Coalescence to help set up a large move, or bridge the gap between disconnected facets of the same type.\n\nNOTE: Using an Antiquarian skill while Scrying does not consume one of your limited turns. Instead, you expend a Magicka Charge. The crystals located at the top of the Antiquarian's Eye display your remaining charges. You can replenish these Magicka Charges by claiming Foci."
"155022052-0-290";"You upgraded the Coalescence skill! This enhanced version of the skill allows you to exert your influence over a larger, snowflake-shaped pattern of facets.\n\nNOTE: Upgrading Antiquarian skills does not increase their Magicka Charge cost.

"155022052-0-291";"You unlocked Dilation! This skill mimics the standard Scry action with one important difference. Rather than only gaining facets in proximity to the selected facet, you claim ALL facets of that type that touch your area of control, as well as those directly adjacent.\n\nUse Dilation to extend your area of control in all directions, dramatically increasing your influence over the Eye!\n\nNOTE: Using an Antiquarian skill while Scrying does not consume one of your limited turns. Instead, you expend a Magicka Charge. The crystals located at the top of the Antiquarian's Eye display your remaining charges. You can replenish these Magicka Charges by claiming Foci."
"155022052-0-292";"You upgraded Dilation! This enhanced version of the skill allows you to extend your claim to EVERY contiguous facet of the same type.\n\nRemember that Dilation works in all directions, allowing your to work towards many Foci at the same time!\n\nNOTE: Upgrading Antiquarian skills does not increase their Magicka Charge cost. And like before, using these skills does not consume a turn."
"155022052-0-293";"You unlocked Farsight! This skill lets you cast a line straight out from any facet you control, claiming all the facets along that line, up to 4 facets away.\n\nUse Farsight to claim facets or Foci that are just out of reach, or to set up powerful combos with your other skills.\n\nNOTE: Using an Antiquarian skill while Scrying does not consume one of your limited turns. Instead, you expend a Magicka Charge. The crystals located at the top of the Antiquarian's Eye display your remaining charges. You can replenish these Magicka Charges by claiming Foci."
"155022052-0-294";"You upgraded Farsight, increasing its range from 4 facets to 6. Now, you can reach even farther!\n\nHave you tried following up Farsight with the Dilation skill? Purchase the Future Focus passive to acquire more Magicka Charges, allowing greater tactical flexibility while Scrying!\n\nNOTE: Upgrading Antiquarian skills does not increase their Magicka Charge cost. And like before, using these skills does not consume a turn."

If the Antiquity is caught in the explosion, however, it will instantly break.\n\nTry chaining multiple Fissures together into one massive, site-clearing explosion! It's a great—albeit risky—way to remove a lot of dirt."
"155022052-0-299";"You upgraded your Heavy Shovel! Now, there is a chance that using the Heavy Shovel will not reduce your Intuition meter.\n\nTry using the Heavy Shovel to clear deep tracts of soil. Just be careful not to break the Antiquity while doing so!"
"155022052-0-300";"You upgraded Augur! Your heightened mystical senses can now locate Antiquities buried even deeper. Additionally, the skill provides more accurate results, better indicating where the Antiquity lies.\n\nTry using your upgraded Augur to locate well-hidden Antiquities!"
