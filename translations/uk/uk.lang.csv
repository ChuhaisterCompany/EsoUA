"232026500-0-3960";"Yes, the cure worked perfectly."
"232026500-0-3962";"We can't kill the Duke. Camlorn needs him."
"232026500-0-3968";"What's the next step?"
"232026500-0-3972";"I'm searching for a hunter named Gloria Fausta."
"232026500-0-3976";"Yes, I have it here."
"232026500-0-3991";"So was I meant to learn my true nature?"
"232026500-0-4001";"I also killed <<1>>."
"232026500-0-4003";"I'm glad you stayed to close it."
"232026500-0-4005";"Yes, free to leave this place."
"232026500-0-4015";"I did as you asked."
"232026500-0-4016";"I found the lost treasure. It was a vault full of ancient tomes and scrolls."
"232026500-0-4026";"Richard Dusant is dead, but his spirit thought you might be able to use this."
"232026500-0-4040";"I'm here to help. I know how to defeat Faolchu."
"232026500-0-4049";"The councilors support the resistance."
"232026500-0-4050";"What's next?"
"232026500-0-4056";"<<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-4057";"The serpent ate the goat."
"232026500-0-4060";"The Red Rook enforcers shouldn't bother those people anymore."
"232026500-0-4071";"What does it mean?"

"232026500-0-4079";"Yes, I have it here."
"232026500-0-4084";"Go find Sir Lanis. He's not far."
"232026500-0-4090";"Let Sir Lanis know I'll send anyone else I find to join him."
"232026500-0-4091";"Istraga is dead. Here is its scale."
"232026500-0-4111";"Reward?"
"232026500-0-4115";"As promised, I found a winner."
"232026500-0-4118";"I think I have what you really wanted all along."
"232026500-0-4119";"I have the supply pack, but the gemstones were cursed. I left them."
"232026500-0-4121";"How did this happen?"

"232026500-0-4252";"Is this gift something I actually want?"
"232026500-0-4253";"So Lake Halcyon will be safe?"
"232026500-0-4258";"I've done it."
"232026500-0-4262";"I have. How can I help save the lake?"
"232026500-0-4263";"I certainly hope so."
"232026500-0-4278";"With Reezal-Jul dead, the refugees should be safe now."
"232026500-0-4282";"I disrupted the meeting by killing the Bloodthorn envoy while disguised as a Red Rook."
"232026500-0-4283";"I disrupted the meeting by killing the Bloodthorn envoy while disguised as a Red Rook."
"232026500-0-4315";"He got to the destination."
"232026500-0-4321";"Wyress Delphique suggested I come here."
"232026500-0-4445";"King Fahara'jad sent me to help."
"232026500-0-4453";"Victory for the Pact!"
"232026500-0-4467";"You seem quite sure of that."
"232026500-0-4473";"I anointed all I found."
"232026500-0-4475";"Captain Hjolm sent me to retrieve these plans from the enemy. When I returned I found him dead."
"232026500-0-4476";"The Heart is ours."
"232026500-0-4478";"I was attacked by an enraged spirit. He said you would destroy us all."
"232026500-0-4480";"I burned down their siege gear, as you requested."
"232026500-0-4481";"We've won the day?"
"232026500-0-4482";"Your father told me to report to you."
"232026500-0-4484";"The ritual is complete."
"232026500-0-4485";"Is it done?"
"232026500-0-4487";"I'm glad I could help."
"232026500-0-4488";"The Orcs call themselves the Oathbound. You'll want to look at these documents."
"232026500-0-4489";"Thank you for the warning."
"232026500-0-4490";"He was part of a cult, sacrificing Pact troops. Here's their ritual book."
"232026500-0-4494";"Ahknara is dead."
"232026500-0-4499";"Here is the cap for you, Reesa."
"232026500-0-4502";"It's done. The supplies are burning nicely."
"232026500-0-4505";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-4508";"It's done. Gruznak is dead."
"232026500-0-4517";"I uncovered some disturbing information."
"232026500-0-4520";"I did what you and your brothers wanted. The Ashlander supplies are burning."
"232026500-0-4521";"I found your pants, too."
"232026500-0-4523";"There's a note from his father also."
"232026500-0-4527";"Balreth, the Brother of Strife, is ravaging Stonefalls."
"232026500-0-4529";"He is married and thought little of you."
"232026500-0-4530";"I spoke with a Mage from the past and learned how to bind Balreth."
"232026500-0-4531";"Balreth's power was imbued into a pair of magecrafted guardians."
"232026500-0-4532";"No. He's not in Othrenis. You must go on with your life."
"232026500-0-4533";"His tomb lies to the west."
"232026500-0-4536";"I recovered the relics."
"232026500-0-4537";"I see your whole family got here safely."
"232026500-0-4539";"I witnessed the birth of the Brothers. They used Daedric essence and Nede blood in a ritual."
"232026500-0-4545";"It's done. Seeks-the-Night is dead."
"232026500-0-4552";"What happened? Where are Gar and Bjorick?"
"232026500-0-4553";"<<1>> and I defeated the Goblin Warlord and the spider queen."
"232026500-0-4557";"I'm glad they made it."
"232026500-0-4558";"The, er, general sent me to report to you. What do you need?"
"232026500-0-4559";"So the fort is ours?"
"232026500-0-4560";"<<1>> is in the keep. He's turning soldiers into zombies."
"232026500-0-4561";"Why would Tanval steal the Coral Heart?"
"232026500-0-4562";"I need to speak with your grandmaster."
"232026500-0-4564";"That's good, but Vaermina is after the king."
"232026500-0-4567";"Rhavil attacked me. I had to kill him."
"232026500-0-4572";"She said she'd stay out of trouble. And with the totem I got all of the residents out."
"232026500-0-4573";"Yes. The spellplague curse is broken."
"232026500-0-4575";"You recognize the name?"
"232026500-0-4577";"Do you want this idol?"
"232026500-0-4582";"The pirate captain is dead."
"232026500-0-4584";"I hope you both prosper under this arrangement."
"232026500-0-4585";"I'm not sure you'll always be able to remain isolated."
"232026500-0-4586";"Where will I get so many weapons?"
"232026500-0-4591";"He plans on arming his group and launching an attack on the Maulborn."
"232026500-0-4592";"I met someone who knows where they are."
"232026500-0-4595";"I'm sorry to give you bad news."
"232026500-0-4596";"Here's the cuttle."
"232026500-0-4597";"I met someone who knows where they are."
"232026500-0-4598";"Where are they?"
"232026500-0-4600";"Is there anything else you need me to do?"
"232026500-0-4602";"Ithis Omalor is dead. He was sent to attack you by Magistrix Vox, but didn't know why."
"232026500-0-4603";"Ithis feared for his life. He agreed to surrender if I led him out of the ruins."
"232026500-0-4604";"Rhavil's behavior does sound suspicious."
"232026500-0-4606";"I recovered your cargo and manifest from the raiders."
"232026500-0-4609";"I found this note. I think there's something suspicious about the General's new retainer."
"232026500-0-4611";"The beasts at the shrines were deliberately drawn by piles of offal."
"232026500-0-4619";"I've been sent to help, Sergeant."
"232026500-0-4621";"Let's finish this, already!"
"232026500-0-4622";"Hang on. Open your eyes. Come on, now."
"232026500-0-4624";"So you'll free him and put a stop to this?"
"232026500-0-4628";"I completed the Trial of the Fang."
"232026500-0-4629";"The Dominion won't threaten Hissmir anymore."
"232026500-0-4630";"I recovered the relics from <<1>>."
"232026500-0-4631";"Dominion soldiers killed the pilgrims. I've slain them in turn."
"232026500-0-4636";"You were the one who summoned the Daedra?"
"232026500-0-4637";"Ragna knew something was wrong from the start."
"232026500-0-4638";"I'm happy to surprise you."
"232026500-0-4640";"Yes. The <<z:1>> is safe."
"232026500-0-4641";"From what I've found, someone is framing the Shadowscales for the murders."
"232026500-0-4642";"Yes, they're safe. Are you all right?"
"232026500-0-4643";"Where is <<1>>?"
"232026500-0-4651";"Yes. The grandmaster's son is being held in a tomb west of town."
"232026500-0-4652";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-4653";"I'm done."
"232026500-0-4654";"I'm ready to help you stop Tanval."
"232026500-0-4656";"So you propose a partnership, then?"
"232026500-0-4662";"I've used the Ashlanders' medicine on dying soldiers at the Wise-Woman's request."
"232026500-0-4664";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-4671";"Yes, Sergeant. He engaged the Maulborn without regard for his own safety."
"232026500-0-4672";"Saryvn was captured when he wandered away from the fort. He didn't find the book. I did."
"232026500-0-4675";"The Vereansu leader is dead."
"232026500-0-4676";"How is it spreading so quickly?"
"232026500-0-4689";"I did what I had to do."
"232026500-0-4695";"I've freed your guards."
"232026500-0-4700";"I made the mixture. The wasps became very angry."
"232026500-0-4702";"Drillk, I need that keystone."
"232026500-0-4703";"I've recovered the keystone, so to speak. I seem to have absorbed it."
"232026500-0-4704";"I found this Ayleid relic in the Temple of Sul. It awakens the pilasters inside."
"232026500-0-4707";"Nothing will control those constructs again."
"232026500-0-4708";"Here are the medallions I found."
"232026500-0-4715";"I did what I had to do."
"232026500-0-4717";"I've brought you a letter from <<1>>."
"232026500-0-4720";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"232026500-0-4721";"Didn't you destroy her?"
"232026500-0-4724";"<<1>> said the Aldmeri Dominion landed nearby."
"232026500-0-4725";"Ulov is dead."
"232026500-0-4726";"When should I unseal it?"
"232026500-0-4731";"I've defeated the guardian atronachs. I should be able to call them to us."
"232026500-0-4732";"We defeated him together."
"232026500-0-4733";"<<1>> sent me. I've collapsed the Scamp cave entrances."
"232026500-0-4734";"Walks-in-Ash said the Covenant has attacked here, and sent me to help."
"232026500-0-4735";"You mean she'll escape again?"
"232026500-0-4736";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-4741";"I have your crystal shards"
"232026500-0-4742";"I found all the shards."
"232026500-0-4743";"I recovered the crystal shards."
"232026500-0-4744";"Here are the shards."
"232026500-0-4745";"I recovered the shards."
"232026500-0-4746";"I'm here to destroy Vox."
"232026500-0-4756";"Are you all right now?"
"232026500-0-4757";"I see you did too."
"232026500-0-4759";"Yes you are."
"232026500-0-4760";"There you go."
"232026500-0-4761";"You made it!"
"232026500-0-4763";"You're free!"
"232026500-0-4765";"Borolg is dead."
"232026500-0-4766";"Yes. I also stabbed his corpse with your dagger."
"232026500-0-4772";"The Dreadlord is dealt with."
"232026500-0-4806";"I've fought it."
"232026500-0-4849";"What's next?"
"232026500-0-4913";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-4931";"What are your plans?"
"232026500-0-4942";"Here. I wrote it all down. Take my notes."
"232026500-0-4943";"Captain Dunveril has been slain."
"232026500-0-4946";"How did you get here before me?"
"232026500-0-4948";"The Ordinators have summoned their men to guard the walls."
"232026500-0-4949";"Take it and make sure your family doesn't starve."
"232026500-0-4951";"The gorge is safe now."
"232026500-0-4956";"What can I do with the keystone?"
"232026500-0-4966";"The Shadowscales have defeated the Dominion at Murkwater."
"232026500-0-5035";"He didn't surrender. He fought to his last breath."
"232026500-0-5037";"I couldn't find any evidence as to who placed the vials of noxious fumes."
"232026500-0-5043";"I've made all of the exchanges."
"232026500-0-5045";"How does this help me stop Vox?"
"232026500-0-5046";"Drillk would've died had I taken the keystone from him. We can't use it."
"232026500-0-5059";"Your mercenaries have recovered nicely."
"232026500-0-5060";"The Maulborn sacrificed their own troops so that Vox could escape with the Judgment of Veloth."
"232026500-0-5061";"I'll do my best to defeat Vox."
"232026500-0-5062";"Acolyte Eldri said you needed these Dremora hearts."
"232026500-0-5065";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5068";"Let's end this."
"232026500-0-5069";"I think that's the last of them."
"232026500-0-5070";"I suppose it was a fitting end."
"232026500-0-5076";"The portal is open."
"232026500-0-5077";"Is that it? Is it over?"
"232026500-0-5082";"What are you?"
"232026500-0-5085";"I have them. Saervild wasn't a traitor. A Dominion spy stole his skin."
"232026500-0-5087";"<<1>> sent me. These supplies are for you."
"232026500-0-5088";"I used the keystone to free the prisoners. We won't have it against the Dominion."
"232026500-0-5090";"Are you at peace?"
"232026500-0-5092";"Here are your remains. May they bring you peace."
"232026500-0-5093";"I took care of it. Carina is dead and I've retrieved your orders."
"232026500-0-5094";"Yes. I â€¦ absorbed it."
"232026500-0-5096";"Your father died defending Selfora. The town is safe now."
"232026500-0-5105";"Happy to help, Master."
"232026500-0-5106";"Garyn sent me. How can I help?"
"232026500-0-5107";"Is there anything else I can do?"
"232026500-0-5110";"Yes, we found this tome and crystal in Mzeneldt."
"232026500-0-5114";"I was able to get the wine from Hectur."
"232026500-0-5117";"talk to the guy"
"232026500-0-5118";"I have it."
"232026500-0-5120";"The spider did most of the work."
"232026500-0-5122";"All the creatures you spoke of are dead."
"232026500-0-5124";"That doesn't make it right. Return the items, or I'll make sure the guards hear of this."
"232026500-0-5131";"Tanval wished you to follow him as interim leader of our forces in Stonefalls."
"232026500-0-5139";"The Talking quest"
"232026500-0-5142";"A giant spider construct and this Dwarven relic."
"232026500-0-5154";"There are fewer of Vox's fanatics now."
"232026500-0-5155";"I killed a number of Vox's forces at Eidolon's Hollow."
"232026500-0-5163";"This is for you."
"232026500-0-5166";"What now, Guildmaster?"
"232026500-0-5169";"What are we looking for?"
"232026500-0-5170";"The Fang <<1>> found drove him to choose death over losing it."
"232026500-0-5171";"What do we do now?"
"232026500-0-5182";"Did Vox kill you, spirit?"
"232026500-0-5183";"How am I going to save your students?"
"232026500-0-5187";"Yes, here are the encoded scrolls."
"232026500-0-5191";"What's the next step?"
"232026500-0-5196";"Are you both all right?"
"232026500-0-5204";"Your father's in the tower with the Daedra Lord. It's a long story."
"232026500-0-5205";"I see your father found you."
"232026500-0-5206";"Your father's dead, and the Daedra Lord's banished. It was a sordid task, but it had to be done."
"232026500-0-5213";"Your students passed their tests."
"232026500-0-5214";"Here's what I was able to find."
"232026500-0-5215";"Feyne will be happier in Narsis."
"232026500-0-5220";"<<1>> died of poison."
"232026500-0-5221";"You don't have to give me a present."
"232026500-0-5234";"Ulov is dead."
"232026500-0-5247";"I closed the Daedric portals."
"232026500-0-5251";"I found his body and this necklace."
"232026500-0-5256";"The Seneschal said I should speak with you â€¦ Your Grace."
"232026500-0-5257";"I will."
"232026500-0-5261";"I'm sorry, but I didn't learn the performance."
"232026500-0-5264";"Everything got hazy. And then I saw a mammoth â€¦ being chased by a cat."
"232026500-0-5265";"The Fang <<1>> took strongly affected him. He survived â€¦ but barely."
"232026500-0-5266";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5267";"Sheogorath put me through another trial. But I have the third book."
"232026500-0-5268";"I'm here to help. The Companions sent me."
"232026500-0-5269";"I saw him return to life but couldn't stop it. What now?"
"232026500-0-5270";"I'm just glad I was able to get some of your people out."
"232026500-0-5273";"Your family is safe, Gjakil."
"232026500-0-5274";"Just good to see you all awake."
"232026500-0-5275";"I found these books around the island."
"232026500-0-5277";"What will happen to the refugees now?"
"232026500-0-5279";"I found this runestone in the Goblin camp, in the hand of a dead Nord."
"232026500-0-5280";"The cultists imbue the Reachmen with dark powers. Stral is at the ruin."
"232026500-0-5282";"The Seneschal said I should speak with you â€¦ Your Grace."
"232026500-0-5285";"I have the shards."
"232026500-0-5287";"Uh, yes. Here are the crystals. I guess."
"232026500-0-5288";"Yes, here they are."
"232026500-0-5289";"I found the five shards."
"232026500-0-5290";"Yes, I have them right here."
"232026500-0-5300";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-5301";"I think you're safe now."
"232026500-0-5302";"Here we go."
"232026500-0-5303";"Here's the part where you reward me."
"232026500-0-5304";"What's my reward?"
"232026500-0-5305";"I think you can make it home safely from here."
"232026500-0-5306";"How's that freedom working out for you?"
"232026500-0-5307";"Erâ€¦ sure."
"232026500-0-5311";"I have slain the Twilight Boss!"
"232026500-0-5312";"I killed him."
"232026500-0-5313";"Give me the prize."
"232026500-0-5314";"I've killed Remelie."
"232026500-0-5315";"Remelie is dead."
"232026500-0-5316";"The boss is dead."
"232026500-0-5317";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-5318";"Cloggg is dead; justice is done."
"232026500-0-5319";"I do."
"232026500-0-5328";"I said, I didn't kill Remelie."
"232026500-0-5329";"Hah!"
"232026500-0-5331";"Remelie is dead."
"232026500-0-5332";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5333";"Haha, I laugh at your misfortune."
"232026500-0-5334";"Give me the prize."
"232026500-0-5338";"Narsis sent me to provide assistance."
"232026500-0-5339";"I've come to report that the Obsidian Gorge is safe once more."
"232026500-0-5342";"Yes. Here are the Graveborn hearts."
"232026500-0-5345";"You're right. The Maulborn are experimenting on the afflicted."
"232026500-0-5346";"Reporting in, captain."
"232026500-0-5348";"For Melril!"
"232026500-0-5351";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5352";"Here's the Cartulary. What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5356";"Are you all right?"
"232026500-0-5359";"You fought bravely."
"232026500-0-5364";"I'm sorry. Your husband is dead. I brought the relics to you, to pay off his debt."
"232026500-0-5365";"Your husband would want you to have these. You can sell them and start fresh."
"232026500-0-5376";"I've secured the Hall. I'm afraid the axe Wuuthrad is missing."
"232026500-0-5379";"I don't know. I just heard you needed help."
"232026500-0-5380";"The tree-minder said you'll make a fine healer."
"232026500-0-5381";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5389";"Thank you. What can I do to help?"
"232026500-0-5392";"Glad you both made it."
"232026500-0-5393";"What's happened here?"
"232026500-0-5395";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5398";"I've killed him, Hoknir."
"232026500-0-5400";"The bandits were contracted by the Daggerfall Covenant to steal a Daedric artifact."
"232026500-0-5401";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5409";"Thank you, Jofnir."
"232026500-0-5413";"I'm ready, Rana. What do we do now?"
"232026500-0-5414";"I found evidence of a necromancer working with the Covenant."
"232026500-0-5415";"The caverns are safe, now."
"232026500-0-5417";"The Frozen Man had him. He's all right now."
"232026500-0-5419";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5421";"I'm just glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5427";"Here, let me untie you."
"232026500-0-5429";"You're welcome, Valaste."
"232026500-0-5430";"You're going to be fine, Geilund."
"232026500-0-5442";"Then we've done everything we can."
"232026500-0-5477";"Just tell me what's going on."
"232026500-0-5478";"Captain Rana sent me. I'm here to help."
"232026500-0-5479";"I'm here to help you. Captain Rana sent me."
"232026500-0-5480";"It's time to evacuate."
"232026500-0-5483";"What happens now?"
"232026500-0-5490";"Did you all make it back safely?"
"232026500-0-5491";"Where have they gone, Aera?"
"232026500-0-5492";"Did I get them all?"
"232026500-0-5496";"We've won the day?"
"232026500-0-5499";"They've all lost children to the war. They blame Kyne."
"232026500-0-5501";"We held?"
"232026500-0-5504";"Thank you, Jofnir."
"232026500-0-5508";"Your idea worked great."
"232026500-0-5509";"My head hurts."
"232026500-0-5511";"I hope that sends the message you wanted."
"232026500-0-5519";"Did anyone else survive?"
"232026500-0-5520";"I'm with you, Darj."
"232026500-0-5525";"Here are the pelts you requested."
"232026500-0-5548";"Yes. There are fewer Shadowed Path necromancers now."
"232026500-0-5557";"We've repelled the Covenant attack there. Did the signal fires work?"
"232026500-0-5558";"<<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-5561";"Praxin and his squad succumbed to the whispers."
"232026500-0-5564";"Will Droi recover now?"
"232026500-0-5566";"Go to Windhelm and have them send someone to clean up this mess."
"232026500-0-5567";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5571";"I found these notes in weapon caches hidden around the city."
"232026500-0-5572";"You wanted to speak to me?"
"232026500-0-5573";"Hadring was attacked during the race. I had a chance to speak with him before he died."
"232026500-0-5574";"I found a camp outside the city. You should see these."
"232026500-0-5575";"King Jorunn sent me to tell you he's fine."
"232026500-0-5582";"Halskar's dead. I found these orders in a lockbox, along with these relics."
"232026500-0-5588";"Yes. I found Atirion and killed him."
"232026500-0-5589";"Good to see she's safe."
"232026500-0-5593";"I killed <<1>>."
"232026500-0-5595";"Yes, I recovered several items."
"232026500-0-5596";"I completed the tasks for the Argonian and Dark Elf leaders."
"232026500-0-5598";"We eliminated the Orcthane's spymaster and shaman."
"232026500-0-5599";"You wanted to speak to me?"
"232026500-0-5600";"Now there are a few less of them."
"232026500-0-5602";"I'll find your body and your crown. Also, I still need to return your amulet to your tomb."
"232026500-0-5604";"Yes."
"232026500-0-5606";"I have your banner here."
"232026500-0-5607";"Yes, Captain Juras is at rest."
"232026500-0-5608";"You'll let her go? Just like that?"
"232026500-0-5610";"Is there anything else I should know about siege weapons?"
"232026500-0-5612";"I've brought back the pieces of your Crystal."
"232026500-0-5613";"I'll head for Skuldafn immediately."
"232026500-0-5622";"Yes. They're in the crystal."
"232026500-0-5624";"The Bad Man is no more."
"232026500-0-5625";"Yes. I hope this is enough."
"232026500-0-5627";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-5637";"I collected these notes from the Stormfist scouts."
"232026500-0-5639";"General Noramil sent me."
"232026500-0-5641";"Someone called the Hound. But he won't be troubling you any longer."
"232026500-0-5642";"Here are the ceremonial gems you wanted."
"232026500-0-5644";"<<1>> and <<2>> are safe now."
"232026500-0-5646";"Will you be taking over for <<1>>?"
"232026500-0-5647";"The Worm Cult can't enslave you again?"
"232026500-0-5650";"Lob the Cleaver is dead."
"232026500-0-5658";"<Place the sword and shield beside Lothgar's body.>"
"232026500-0-5676";"Don't make me regret my decision."
"232026500-0-5678";"Your brother sent me to find you."
"232026500-0-5682";"Raynor is right. You almost died in here."
"232026500-0-5683";"Kireth is right. You don't need anyone's approval."
"232026500-0-5685";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5686";"You mentioned I would receive power for helping you."
"232026500-0-5701";"Will your new prison hold him?"
"232026500-0-5705";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5711";"The Shrikes destroyed your ship."
"232026500-0-5712";"Where are you heading now?"
"232026500-0-5716";"Let me try."
"232026500-0-5717";"Where can I find Fildgor?"
"232026500-0-5719";"The Ebonheart Pact is sealed and Fildgor lives."
"232026500-0-5720";"Fildgor is dead, and the Ebonheart Pact is sealed."
"232026500-0-5725";"I defeated the Covenant necromancer who corrupted the barrow."
"232026500-0-5731";"They've sealed the ruins. No one can get in or out."
"232026500-0-5734";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5736";"Be careful on the road."
"232026500-0-5742";"I'm glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5746";"I found more ore."
"232026500-0-5748";"What did the cult want with you?"
"232026500-0-5753";"Yes. I destroyed the manifest."
"232026500-0-5754";"Can you make it from here?"
"232026500-0-5755";"The sailboats are burning."
"232026500-0-5760";"Go well, Treva."
"232026500-0-5765";"Yes. Are you drunk?"
"232026500-0-5766";"The Worm Cult was here. I've pushed them out of Riften, but they left with a shard of Wuuthrad."
"232026500-0-5778";"Do you think the Bosmer and Drublog will ever stop fighting?"
"232026500-0-5780";"Don't worry about it. Here are the ingredients you needed."
"232026500-0-5783";"Are you all right?"
"232026500-0-5784";"I did everything I could."
"232026500-0-5785";"Have we made a difference?"
"232026500-0-5788";"I hope things will settle down at the mine now"
"232026500-0-5789";"Their union has been a long time coming."
"232026500-0-5790";"Glad to help."
"232026500-0-5791";"She's floating all around you."
"232026500-0-5797";"You're welcome. The cult can't try that again?"
"232026500-0-5806";"Fildgor's spies have infiltrated Fort Amol!"
"232026500-0-5807";"I'm not so sure."
"232026500-0-5816";"I got the deed to your mine."
"232026500-0-5821";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5826";"I convinced the Dark Elves and Argonians to return to the Prince's meeting."
"232026500-0-5827";"I had to kill you to stop the Cult."
"232026500-0-5828";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-5831";"I did. Are you going to make it?"
"232026500-0-5843";"What will we do about Thorulf?"
"232026500-0-5846";"Yes, it seems they did."
"232026500-0-5851";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5856";"The High-King sent me. What can I do?"
"232026500-0-5857";"Ganthis sent me to look into the murders."
"232026500-0-5859";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-5865";"Fildgor's agents tried to kill me, too."
"232026500-0-5872";"Here is your silk."
"232026500-0-5873";"Here is your silk."
"232026500-0-5880";"I was proud to do my part."
"232026500-0-5885";"He escaped. I let him go to save you."
"232026500-0-5886";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5889";"I'll avenge you!"
"232026500-0-5891";"Are you going to be all right?"
"232026500-0-5896";"I have a dispatch from Fort Morvunskar."
"232026500-0-5899";"Just tell me what's going on."
"232026500-0-5900";"Can I help?"
"232026500-0-5901";"Can I help?"
"232026500-0-5902";"Can I help?"
"232026500-0-5903";"I hope you and Rigvar have learned a lesson here."
"232026500-0-5928";"Is this Jorunn's Stand?"
"232026500-0-5931";"The spirit <<1>> sent me to you."
"232026500-0-5932";"I'm here to help."
"232026500-0-5933";"Good to see you too, Vigrod."
"232026500-0-5935";"You believe the Worms were pawns?"
"232026500-0-5936";"I've collected amulets from the bodies of fallen Pact soldiers."
"232026500-0-5952";"Second courier? What do you mean?"
"232026500-0-5953";"The militia is here. It looks like they made it."
"232026500-0-5954";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-5955";"What will you do next?"
"232026500-0-5956";"Mera Stormcloak sent me."
"232026500-0-5957";"Perhaps. Maybe you'll tell me more about yourself."
"232026500-0-5958";"I've got your family treasures. I must say, they aren't what I expected."
"232026500-0-5959";"I found one of Wuuthrad's shards. I didn't see any Riften guards up there."
"232026500-0-5963";"The lamia queen is no more."
"232026500-0-5967";"What now?"
"232026500-0-5971";"All right. If you insist."
"232026500-0-5972";"Yes. The bath salts are dangerous."
"232026500-0-5983";"What will your people do now?"
"232026500-0-5985";"I have the Sigil here. Your mother asked me to find it."
"232026500-0-5990";"I saved as many villagers as I could."
"232026500-0-5992";"<Open Hadmal's chest.>"
"232026500-0-6009";"Yes, my Queen."
"232026500-0-6010";"Pay up. I beat your record."
"232026500-0-6011";"What happens now?"
"232026500-0-6012";"I'm glad I was here to help."
"232026500-0-6013";"So it worked?"
"232026500-0-6021";"You'll find all the proof you need, inside."
"232026500-0-6022";"I have your gear."
"232026500-0-6023";"The Queen asked me to meet her here."
"232026500-0-6027";"Any time, my Queen."
"232026500-0-6032";"What do you mean?"
"232026500-0-6042";"Well met. I have urgent news for Thane Fjora."
"232026500-0-6043";"Yes. But I burned their bodies."
"232026500-0-6048";"They'll need some more recruits."
"232026500-0-6053";"Yes, I have it here."
"232026500-0-6055";"You mean the ghostly mammoths, I expect?"
"232026500-0-6091";"You should be safe here. I'll find your husband."
"232026500-0-6092";"It's not safe here. You should get out now."
"232026500-0-6093";"You had no choice. You did what you had to."
"232026500-0-6094";"Garil is dead."
"232026500-0-6095";"What am I missing?"
"232026500-0-6096";"Garil is dead."
"232026500-0-6097";"You're a liar and a cheat, Enthis."
"232026500-0-6098";"You're a liar and a cheat, Turil."
"232026500-0-6124";"The party's in full swing. Now's your best chance."
"232026500-0-6125";"Sorry, Mael. He was killed by trolls. I have your supplies though."
"232026500-0-6137";"Yes, it's gone."
"232026500-0-6153";"Yes. They should be dying like flies."
"232026500-0-6156";"What's next?"
"232026500-0-6159";"Yes, she's dead again."
"232026500-0-6161";"What's wrong?"
"232026500-0-6164";"That's it?"
"232026500-0-6165";"A map."
"232026500-0-6166";"Thank you, I think."
"232026500-0-6167";"Just glad I could help, Thane."
"232026500-0-6168";"I'm glad to have entertained."
"232026500-0-6169";"Why was the shard so vital to Gullveig?"
"232026500-0-6175";"The spies drank from the goblet."
"232026500-0-6176";"Very. What's our next move?"
"232026500-0-6181";"Thank you, your Grace."
"232026500-0-6183";"I killed some of the flame atronachs."
"232026500-0-6191";"I spoke to all three of them. Are they ill?"
"232026500-0-6195";"The Black Daggers need to set better ambushes."
"232026500-0-6197";"Yes, you'll find him there."
"232026500-0-6198";"I told Bar-Neeus of your scheme. He gave me a package for you."
"232026500-0-6202";"Glad to be of service. About my paymentâ€¦"
"232026500-0-6211";"Golden Jack is dead. I win."
"232026500-0-6214";"I dropped them off."
"232026500-0-6215";"Yes. I took care of him. He was a mage named Sanessalmo."
"232026500-0-6218";"I'm ready to put an end to the Worm Cult."
"232026500-0-6220";"I've read those two books and talked to your very odd friend."
"232026500-0-6223";"I don't know. I just heard you needed help."
"232026500-0-6224";"<Add Linele and Lolann's names to the logbook.>"
"232026500-0-6226";"What was that?"
"232026500-0-6227";"You can ask his assistant Anenwen if you don't believe me."
"232026500-0-6232";"I got an autographed book for you â€¦ but I discovered something."
"232026500-0-6234";"I spoke with <<1>> before he died. He would have wanted you to have this."
"232026500-0-6250";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6252";"I meant it. You were trying to save lives, right?"
"232026500-0-6256";"I'm here to help."
"232026500-0-6257";"I think your Worm Cult problems are settled, for now at least."
"232026500-0-6270";"Sorry, I couldn't work out a deal for you."
"232026500-0-6274";"I'm glad to hear it. Raerana said you might reward me."
"232026500-0-6278";"I'm sure your faith will be rewarded someday."
"232026500-0-6281";"Always happy to kill Worm Cultists."
"232026500-0-6282";"What do we do now, Raz?"
"232026500-0-6283";"She'd be proud, Raz. She didn't die in vain."
"232026500-0-6284";"Well fought, Lakhazga."
"232026500-0-6295";"When will I speak to you again?"
"232026500-0-6300";"What now, Aldarch?"
"232026500-0-6301";"Yes, here they are."
"232026500-0-6303";"I should report in to her, right?"
"232026500-0-6304";"I accept, your Majesty."
"232026500-0-6306";"But they will now?"
"232026500-0-6308";"How did you do that?"
"232026500-0-6324";"Job's done, Gorgath. Varnedo is dead."
"232026500-0-6330";"Here's <<1>>."
"232026500-0-6331";"I've brought <<1>> back."
"232026500-0-6334";"Some of the troops made it off the field, and we destroyed their supply hut."
"232026500-0-6336";"We wiped out the cultists and stopped the ritual."
"232026500-0-6359";"Ready to get out of here?"
"232026500-0-6363";"Ready to join your friends and head back to the surface?"
"232026500-0-6364";"They are spirited."
"232026500-0-6365";"Yes. I killed Khralek."
"232026500-0-6369";"Malsia! Can you hear me? Malsia?"
"232026500-0-6370";"Don't worry. I brought <<1>> the herb she needs."
"232026500-0-6373";"What about my reward?"
"232026500-0-6374";"Smart? Because I reported Nilwen?"
"232026500-0-6378";"Odunn said you might want these glowflies."
"232026500-0-6379";"You turned <<1>> against me."
"232026500-0-6390";"Is this staff yours?"
"232026500-0-6397";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6398";"It had to be done."
"232026500-0-6399";"You did the right thing."
"232026500-0-6404";"Why won't you listen to reason?"
"232026500-0-6405";"Tanion is dead."
"232026500-0-6409";"Thanks."
"232026500-0-6410";"I left Fjar behind."
"232026500-0-6411";"All three officers are dead."
"232026500-0-6412";"I'll let you give the cuttle to Boril."
"232026500-0-6422";"It's all true. I saw it with my own eyes."
"232026500-0-6423";"He was totally useless."
"232026500-0-6425";"Thanks. I think."
"232026500-0-6426";"Is there anything I can do?"
"232026500-0-6427";"What happened back there?"
"232026500-0-6429";"I put the spirit to rest."
"232026500-0-6430";"I put the spirits to rest."
"232026500-0-6436";"We've won?"
"232026500-0-6440";"I left Hald behind."
"232026500-0-6441";"I left Hilka behind."
"232026500-0-6444";"Tamien Sellan told me to bring the villagers here to hide."
"232026500-0-6446";"I rescued the villagers and destroyed the Bloodthorn boats."
"232026500-0-6447";"Tamien and I stopped the necromantic ritual and rescued his father, but the Bloodthorns escaped."
"232026500-0-6450";"Yes, that's the truth."
"232026500-0-6458";"Your son sent me here to cast your spell. He should be here shortly."
"232026500-0-6466";"Help Captain Kaleen and I pull off her heist."
"232026500-0-6480";"I'm sorry she escaped, your majesty."
"232026500-0-6487";"The witch Drodda froze you with a spell. She's dead now."
"232026500-0-6493";"The treasure. It's cursed. What happened here?"
"232026500-0-6495";"<Claim bounty.>"
"232026500-0-6510";"I'll side with Angof the Undying."
"232026500-0-6512";"Can you get a warning to Firsthold in time?"
"232026500-0-6514";"I came to warn you of a Daedric attack, but it looks like I'm too late."
"232026500-0-6526";"Yes. I was never here."
"232026500-0-6527";"I'm sorry, Elanwe."
"232026500-0-6528";"What now?"
"232026500-0-6535";"I'll side with Thallik of the Wormcult."
"232026500-0-6536";"I'll side with Kinlady Estre."
"232026500-0-6547";"End"
"232026500-0-6550";"Enter Castle Vault"
"232026500-0-6557";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6567";"I came to speak with you about High Kinlady Estre and the Veiled Heritance."
"232026500-0-6568";"The Battlereeve said you're looking into a Veiled Heritance connection here?"
"232026500-0-6572";"My message?"
"232026500-0-6573";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6574";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6575";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6576";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6577";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6580";"I gave Marq his brew and he left the Goblin camp."
"232026500-0-6581";"I did what I could."
"232026500-0-6587";"Your long debate has been decided."
"232026500-0-6588";"Your long debate has been decided."
"232026500-0-6602";"I've done all that you've asked."
"232026500-0-6603";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6604";"You're welcome. What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6605";"Was that good?"
"232026500-0-6627";"I rescued your assistants."
"232026500-0-6629";"You should go."
"232026500-0-6630";"You should leave before she changes her mind."
"232026500-0-6631";"It's not really my business."
"232026500-0-6635";"Yes, in a crocodile's stomach."
"232026500-0-6637";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6641";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6643";"<<1>> agreed to collect wamasu lightning for you."
"232026500-0-6644";"I charged the amulet, but it didn't protect me from the lightning."
"232026500-0-6647";"Your crew is all accounted for, then?"
"232026500-0-6649";"There's a safe haven to the west. The Hollow City."
"232026500-0-6654";"I'm glad you survived the Tower of Lies."
"232026500-0-6657";"The pirate leader is dead."
"232026500-0-6659";"I thinned them out. Here's <<Az:1>> you wanted."
"232026500-0-6660";"<<1>> fled. She was working for <<2>>."
"232026500-0-6661";"Yes, <<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-6684";"Very well, I'll help you."
"232026500-0-6685";"Very well, I'll help you."
"232026500-0-6686";"Here. Take them."
"232026500-0-6690";"What about the others?"
"232026500-0-6693";"<<1>> was the poisoner. She was working for <<2>>."
"232026500-0-6694";"The workers made it to safety."
"232026500-0-6700";"I've recovered three journals."
"232026500-0-6705";"I have something for you."
"232026500-0-6708";"Who are you?"
"232026500-0-6713";"<<1>> says you'll have the finest weapons in <<2>>."
"232026500-0-6724";"They're all at peace now."
"232026500-0-6731";"I ran into some trouble, but it was nothing I couldn't handle."
"232026500-0-6735";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-6742";"I got all but Aranias. She fled the island for Greenshade."
"232026500-0-6772";"The archers should be less of a problem now."
"232026500-0-6787";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6789";"No. Your lover is long dead."
"232026500-0-6795";"I found it."
"232026500-0-6796";"Yes, and I brought back some of your valuables."
"232026500-0-6802";"Yes, it's done."
"232026500-0-6813";"One head has been removed."
"232026500-0-6817";"Happy to help."
"232026500-0-6822";"I did. But he left me to die over there."
"232026500-0-6835";"I destroyed the ones I found."
"232026500-0-6837";"Help Captain Kaleen with the big heist she's got planned."
"232026500-0-6838";"Was the Eye destroyed?"
"232026500-0-6839";"I found this."
"232026500-0-6842";"I delivered the petitions, despite an Imperial ambush."
"232026500-0-6846";"Yes, here's the book."
"232026500-0-6852";"I'm glad I could help."
"232026500-0-6855";"You're not cut out for warfare. Follow your passion and make weapons."
"232026500-0-6857";"Your mother is right. Keep at this and you'll make a great fighter."
"232026500-0-6859";"What is this place?"
"232026500-0-6861";"The bargain with the Toothmaul tribe is void. Nelanya was driven off."
"232026500-0-6877";"And you forgot?"
"232026500-0-6888";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6890";"I salvaged what I could."
"232026500-0-6891";"Yngrel is a lot bloodier now."
"232026500-0-6892";"I found his remains â€¦ and this letter addressed to you."
"232026500-0-6893";"I decided to keep it. The Covenant needs it."
"232026500-0-6895";"I destroyed it. No one will ever use it again."
"232026500-0-6897";"I have them."
"232026500-0-6923";"What do you think we should do?"
"232026500-0-6924";"What are you going to do?"
"232026500-0-6940";"Captain Kaleen needs help with a heist. You in?"
"232026500-0-6941";"You owe me a favor."
"232026500-0-6942";"I'll talk to the Farseer."
"232026500-0-6944";"I'm a friend of the Green Lady."
"232026500-0-6946";"Is <<1>> all right?"
"232026500-0-6950";"Nelanya is dead, and the bargain with the Toothmaul tribe is void."
"232026500-0-6953";"I worked things out. He'll still transport you to Anvil Island, but expects help from your contacts."
"232026500-0-6956";"A bandit was carrying this."
"232026500-0-6959";"Her last wish was to kill the bandit leader."
"232026500-0-6961";"Have you spoken to the Wood Orcs yet?"
"232026500-0-6965";"And my reward?"
"232026500-0-6966";"<<1>> is dead. [Lie]"
"232026500-0-6969";"Have you spoken to the Wood Orcs yet?"
"232026500-0-6971";"Thank you. I think we've contained the Dro-m'Athra."
"232026500-0-6972";"You're Khali, right? <<1>> sent me."
"232026500-0-6974";"So you'll release Raston?"
"232026500-0-6976";"Why did you send me to stop the necromancers if there wasn't a real Ayleid warlord?"
"232026500-0-6977";"Dulini sent me to retrieve these."
"232026500-0-6987";"How did you do that?"
"232026500-0-6988";"Captain Kaleen sent me. She needs your help with a heist."
"232026500-0-6989";"Captain Kaleen sent me. She'd like you to help with a big heist she's planning."
"232026500-0-6990";"What's going on?"
"232026500-0-6992";"Captain Kaleen needs help with a big heist she's planning. Interested?"
"232026500-0-6993";"How about a trip off this island?"
"232026500-0-6994";"Help Captain Kaleen and I pull off her heist."
"232026500-0-6995";"How about a trip off this island?"
"232026500-0-6996";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-6997";"Why would Z'en kill his own follower?"
"232026500-0-6999";"Dulini sent me to retrieve these."
"232026500-0-7005";"Captain Kaleen needs help with a heist. You in?"
"232026500-0-7006";"You owe me a favor."
"232026500-0-7014";"How can I stop them?"
"232026500-0-7015";"I'm a friend of the Green Lady."
"232026500-0-7016";"The small army of Maulborn that got away. Is it still on the loose?"
"232026500-0-7019";"The Lava Queen is defeated."
"232026500-0-7023";"I think we're done here."
"232026500-0-7024";"I'm glad I found your things."
"232026500-0-7031";"Here's the key."
"232026500-0-7032";"I tracked down Rama and killed him."
"232026500-0-7033";"Rama is dead. Here's his sword as proof."
"232026500-0-7046";"Why would Molag Bal even give her the possibility of escape?"
"232026500-0-7049";"Your plan was to wait around for a stranger to help you?"
"232026500-0-7051";"Thank you for showing me the holy sites of <<1>>."
"232026500-0-7052";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7056";"What's wrong?"
"232026500-0-7057";"At great cost, their leader Vardan separated his spirit from his flesh."
"232026500-0-7060";"We'll get him, Shazah."
"232026500-0-7061";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7063";"I'm not Tazia. Actually, <<1>> sent me to help you."
"232026500-0-7064";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7065";"I'll do what I can."
"232026500-0-7066";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7067";"Thank you, Tazia. Shuzura said something about a few coins?"
"232026500-0-7068";"Thanks â€¦ I think."
"232026500-0-7069";"Yes. Here they are."
"232026500-0-7071";"You suppose? Isn't that good news?"
"232026500-0-7073";"As promised, I have your drawings."
"232026500-0-7078";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7089";"Sounds good. Now where's my coin?"
"232026500-0-7091";"I found your note and an artifact you might be interested in."
"232026500-0-7092";"You're welcome, priestess."
"232026500-0-7095";"Your son died collecting these kwama eggs for you."
"232026500-0-7097";"Your master won't be coming back. I found this."
"232026500-0-7100";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"232026500-0-7101";"blah"
"232026500-0-7102";"So you'd say the Boast went well?"
"232026500-0-7106";"Here's your shield back."
"232026500-0-7112";"He's dead. He sacrificed himself so that the artifact could be destroyed."
"232026500-0-7116";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7118";"I have them."
"232026500-0-7119";"Yes. Here's the crown."
"232026500-0-7120";"<<1>> sent me to help you with your problem."
"232026500-0-7121";"Actually, can I help you? Clan Mother Shuzura sent me."
"232026500-0-7122";"I couldn't let you die."
"232026500-0-7123";"Good luck getting to Daggerfall."
"232026500-0-7124";"The offerings have been made."
"232026500-0-7127";"Do you really think the sap will heal your brother?"
"232026500-0-7132";"So I'm in?"
"232026500-0-7134";"Here's the produce I collected."
"232026500-0-7137";"I didn't do anything to him."
"232026500-0-7141";"I'll do what I can."
"232026500-0-7142";"I found this note and bracelet. Were they your brother's?"
"232026500-0-7145";"This the crown you're looking for?"
"232026500-0-7148";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7149";"I took care of some of them for you."
"232026500-0-7154";"We're moving along."
"232026500-0-7161";"He admitted his men planted the dreugh eggs. Arcady Charnis witnessed it."
"232026500-0-7162";"Alive, last I saw, and with your scout."
"232026500-0-7166";"I found this <<z:1>> with your name on it."
"232026500-0-7168";"I hope it stays lit for you."
"232026500-0-7169";"I bring news of <<1>>'s death."
"232026500-0-7171";"The Bloody Hand has one less skirimisher."
"232026500-0-7181";"I found this."
"232026500-0-7184";"The cult seeks a powerful relic beneath Carzog's Demise."
"232026500-0-7186";"I'm sorry. Your son is dead. I found this journal near his body."
"232026500-0-7189";"I released the spirits, but Carzog's Demise is the cult's target."
"232026500-0-7190";"Observe the Ceremony"
"232026500-0-7194";"Get what over with?"
"232026500-0-7195";"Odei was supposed to meet me on this end of the pass."
"232026500-0-7197";"I found this note under Ilessan Tower."
"232026500-0-7198";"Yes."
"232026500-0-7199";"I hid the books."
"232026500-0-7200";"I found this journal. It contained a message addressed to you."
"232026500-0-7202";"I found this necklace. Does it belong to you?"
"232026500-0-7203";"I found this recipe."
"232026500-0-7209";"A little extra gold and you buy our silence."
"232026500-0-7211";"Has the battle been won?"
"232026500-0-7212";"The First Mane told me to bring you the Claw, actually."
"232026500-0-7213";"I hope your brother is safe."
"232026500-0-7215";"I killed the Timberscar chieftain."
"232026500-0-7216";"I've recovered a horn we can use to control these spirits; we can use them to fight the cult."
"232026500-0-7217";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7218";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7219";"I will."
"232026500-0-7220";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7225";"Good to know."
"232026500-0-7231";"What happens now?"
"232026500-0-7235";"What are you talking about?"
"232026500-0-7237";"I'll see what I can do."
"232026500-0-7238";"I will."
"232026500-0-7252";"No. Naemon seeks to corrupt all of Valenwood."
"232026500-0-7253";"Here, these gems are for you."
"232026500-0-7255";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-7256";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-7257";"And my reward?"
"232026500-0-7268";"How true were those visions?"
"232026500-0-7274";"Firsthold is under siege. The guard at the gates asked me to pass on a request for reinforcements."
"232026500-0-7277";"Then it worked?"
"232026500-0-7280";"I'm proud to stand with you, Khali."
"232026500-0-7281";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-7282";"I need to think about what you've said."
"232026500-0-7283";"Here's the poison. Where's my money?"
"232026500-0-7285";"You have to give him a chance. He's your son. There's always hope."
"232026500-0-7286";"I was happy to help."
"232026500-0-7287";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-7288";"Here you are."
"232026500-0-7289";"It's better for him if you end it now. Nobody should come back like that."
"232026500-0-7290";"He's dead. I found his journal and brought the cure."
"232026500-0-7291";"Dead. I found his journal and brought the cure."
"232026500-0-7306";"Daedra killed him. But he died blessed and at peace."
"232026500-0-7307";"Daedra. Before he died, he blessed me so I could do what he could not."
"232026500-0-7310";"The Red Rook enforcers have been dealt with."
"232026500-0-7315";"I'm looking for Angof."
"232026500-0-7320";"So you'll leave with us?"
"232026500-0-7321";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7326";"These should help."
"232026500-0-7338";"I have your mushrooms."
"232026500-0-7341";"I'm glad they made it back."
"232026500-0-7343";"I worked things out. He'll still transport you to Anvil Island."
"232026500-0-7344";"I come with a message from your brother."
"232026500-0-7345";"I bring a petition. Chief Tazgol wishes to join the Daggerfall Covenant."
"232026500-0-7347";"Good luck to you."
"232026500-0-7349";"Yes, I have them here."
"232026500-0-7351";"Yes, I stopped them."
"232026500-0-7368";"I wish you luck."
"232026500-0-7369";"You must tell the workers the truth."
"232026500-0-7370";"I destroyed the lute and left the bard in a cage."
"232026500-0-7380";"I faced and killed several Dremora."
"232026500-0-7381";"Yes, I think I have enough."
"232026500-0-7382";"I believe we had an arrangement."
"232026500-0-7383";"Of course. They're right here."
"232026500-0-7384";"What is the Heart of Valenwood?"
"232026500-0-7387";"Yes, but warn the runners to beware of ambushers."
"232026500-0-7395";"I have the herbs and the case, just as you asked."
"232026500-0-7398";"We'll get him, Khali."
"232026500-0-7400";"It's done. The giants appear to have accepted the offering."
"232026500-0-7401";"The cultists need a new leader."
"232026500-0-7402";"That's what Laryaril said."
"232026500-0-7407";"Yes. I destroyed them."
"232026500-0-7410";"What is the Heart of Valenwood?"
"232026500-0-7419";"I found this diary. I think it belonged to your cousin."
"232026500-0-7420";"I found this urn with your name on it."
"232026500-0-7421";"I see you made it out alive."
"232026500-0-7422";"What just happened? Where did she go?"
"232026500-0-7424";"Fildgor is dead, and the Ebonheart Pact is sealed."
"232026500-0-7431";"You should tell the others that <<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-7433";"Your problem was a spriggan matron. I took care of it for you."
"232026500-0-7434";"Here is Blackheart's Skull."
"232026500-0-7440";"The High Elf <<1>> brought it to a place of power. I don't know where."
"232026500-0-7446";"Yes, but they won't come back here."
"232026500-0-7451";"I'm glad I was able to help."
"232026500-0-7469";"But she's coming with Andur to destroy you."
"232026500-0-7472";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-7473";"<Check for signs of life.>"
"232026500-0-7485";"What now?"
"232026500-0-7496";"Drillk, I need that keystone."
"232026500-0-7497";"What do you have to say?"
"232026500-0-7500";"I killed the cultists and stopped their rituals."
"232026500-0-7513";"I found it in a <<z:1>>."
"232026500-0-7515";"What should we do now?"
"232026500-0-7516";"What should we do now?"
"232026500-0-7524";"Do you have a plan?"
"232026500-0-7528";"What happened?"
"232026500-0-7530";"What happened?"
"232026500-0-7534";"What's my next step?"
"232026500-0-7536";"<<1>> bought us enough time to save some of the eggs."
"232026500-0-7538";"Is there anything else you need right now?"
"232026500-0-7543";"What about the corruption in the trees?"
"232026500-0-7550";"I'm listening."
"232026500-0-7557";"Vampires were using the mist to create thralls of your hunters."
"232026500-0-7566";"You're welcome. Now, go back to your husband."
"232026500-0-7571";"I'll go immediately."
"232026500-0-7572";"Why am I on a ship?"
"232026500-0-7574";"Why am I on a ship?"
"232026500-0-7584";"I'll go immediately."
"232026500-0-7593";"<Hand over the instructions.>"
"232026500-0-7607";"Yes. I stopped the ritual and freed your crewmen."
"232026500-0-7608";"I stopped the ritual and freed your crew."
"232026500-0-7625";"So you've officially joined the Dominion?"
"232026500-0-7626";"So, this is the Great Shackle?"
"232026500-0-7627";"What will you do next?"
"232026500-0-7632";"What will you do next?"
"232026500-0-7633";"You mentioned information for the Mages Guild earlier."
"232026500-0-7634";"You mentioned information for the Mages Guild earlier."
"232026500-0-7639";"I have a list of supplies that Leono needs."
"232026500-0-7641";"The magicka matrix?"
"232026500-0-7656";"You were right. I found this on the other side of the portal."
"232026500-0-7663";"So you've officiaIly joined the Dominion?"
"232026500-0-7665";"Armin wants you to know he succeeded and will soon be home."
"232026500-0-7667";"I found this note. I thought you might want it."
"232026500-0-7668";"I found this letter about you, Wardiya."
"232026500-0-7670";"I have a delivery for you from <<1>>."
"232026500-0-7672";"That'll have to do."
"232026500-0-7673";"I have something that belongs to you."
"232026500-0-7677";"Sinien stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"232026500-0-7681";"Here's a letter from <<1>>. He said you'd pay."
"232026500-0-7683";"I have some items intended for you."
"232026500-0-7685";"A woman named <<1>> wanted you to have this."
"232026500-0-7686";"Yes. It won't trouble the mine any longer."
"232026500-0-7695";"You can make it to the Hollow City from here?"
"232026500-0-7704";"What happened?"
"232026500-0-7705";"What do I need to do now?"
"232026500-0-7706";"Thank you, Feluni."
"232026500-0-7707";"Thank you, Feluni."
"232026500-0-7708";"Thank you, Feluni."

"232026500-0-7711";"She's dead."
"232026500-0-7713";"How do I set you free?"
"232026500-0-7715";"I had to kill <<1>>. He was selling guests at the Caravan into slavery."
"232026500-0-7720";"The Wilderking told me to find you."
"232026500-0-7721";"So this is Volenfell? I followed your journal entries."
"232026500-0-7726";"Atia? I think this belongs to you."
"232026500-0-7727";"I'm glad I could help."
"232026500-0-7728";"I expect my fair share of the reward too."
"232026500-0-7733";"I found these robes in a bandit camp."
"232026500-0-7734";"Rathisa says your wish has come true."
"232026500-0-7743";"Who are you?"
"232026500-0-7744";"Tertius is still looking for your son."
"232026500-0-7747";"I'm happy to have been of service."
"232026500-0-7748";"It's for the best, I believe."
"232026500-0-7750";"Is this yours? It bears your name."
"232026500-0-7752";"Are you certain?"
"232026500-0-7753";"What is it?"
"232026500-0-7754";"Thanks."
"232026500-0-7755";"Thank you."

"232026500-0-7759";"Yes. I will join the tribe."
"232026500-0-7761";"I think this note is about you."
"232026500-0-7767";"I hope the Mages Guild can help him."
"232026500-0-7770";"I have recovered all of the relics."
"232026500-0-7773";"A friend of yours, <<1>>, asked me to bring you some fish."
"232026500-0-7774";"How do I set you free?"
"232026500-0-7776";"What about the rest of the Maormer?"

"232026500-0-7836";"<<1>> sent me to tell you that Munya is dead."
"232026500-0-7847";"I've just come from Arenthia. The city is free, but the Mane â€¦."
"232026500-0-7861";"He would not violate his oath."
"232026500-0-7863";"Here is the note, your debt is no longer due."
"232026500-0-7871";"You are strong to do this Bakkhara."
"232026500-0-7876";"So the Chasm is clear?"
"232026500-0-7888";"I have a delivery for you."
"232026500-0-7892";"I was told to report to you."
"232026500-0-7893";"Is there nothing else to learn?"
"232026500-0-7899";"I found this near the ruins in Mist Morrow Vale."
"232026500-0-7910";"A priestess of the lunar clergy told me I'd find you out here."
"232026500-0-7911";"You are welcome, Shazah."
"232026500-0-7912";"My Queen, we've lost one of the Lunar Champions to the Dark Mane."
"232026500-0-7914";"Enter Slave Quarters"
"232026500-0-7915";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-7918";"You're sure, then?"
"232026500-0-7919";"You're sure, then?"
"232026500-0-7921";"This note is for you. You're more than you seem."
"232026500-0-7922";"So now our forces can move freely through the Orchard?"
"232026500-0-7923";"Enter Slave Quarters"
"232026500-0-7924";"So you're leaving? What will happen to The Fading Tree?"
"232026500-0-7926";"Your brother wants you, way up north."
"232026500-0-7928";"What we saw â€¦ could it be the future of the Dominion?"
"232026500-0-7929";"Bright Moons, Khali."
"232026500-0-7930";"Yes. I see you and the others made it out all right as well."
"232026500-0-7933";"I have a delivery for you."
"232026500-0-7934";"Do you need anything?"
"232026500-0-7935";"Is there anything else I need to know?"

"232026500-0-7942";"Your children will honor our agreement, correct?"
"232026500-0-7957";"I put an end to the troubles in <<1>> and <<Ac:2>>."
"232026500-0-7971";"She hoped they would spare Bergama."
"232026500-0-7972";"I understand."
"232026500-0-7989";"I didn't do this to take command. You know your business hereâ€”you're in charge."
"232026500-0-7990";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-7994";"What did you do to Selene?"
"232026500-0-7995";"How do I set you free?"
"232026500-0-7997";"The staff is gone. Vicereeve Pelidil stole it."
"232026500-0-8005";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-8014";"Where is the Oghma Infinium?"
"232026500-0-8018";"<Give her the items.>"
"232026500-0-8023";"The Hollow City is safe. You should go there."
"232026500-0-8036";"Take the others to the Hollow City. You'll be safe there."
"232026500-0-8042";"And you're ready to set sail?"
"232026500-0-8049";"With her help, I found proof of her innocence."
"232026500-0-8052";"Things seem to have worked out."
"232026500-0-8057";"I recovered your lute."
"232026500-0-8062";"I'm glad I inspire such confidence."
"232026500-0-8065";"Very well."
"232026500-0-8066";"It's too dangerous. Who knows what it might do to you?"
"232026500-0-8067";"I found this pendant. Is it yours?"
"232026500-0-8069";"I destroyed the gem."
"232026500-0-8070";"I'm glad I was able to help."
"232026500-0-8071";"Actually, I have some bad news. Trolls have taken the mine, and your workers are dead or fled."
"232026500-0-8074";"So, about that treasure."
"232026500-0-8078";"I'm right here."
"232026500-0-8079";"I'm ready for duty. I don't need training."
"232026500-0-8082";"I found Zariya's remains."
"232026500-0-8083";"That might take some time."
"232026500-0-8105";"What will happen to Leki's Blade?"
"232026500-0-8106";"What will happen to Leki's Blade?"

"232026500-0-8127";"The Great Shackle is destroyed?"
"232026500-0-8132";"I'm ready for duty. I don't need training."
"232026500-0-8147";"Will you be all right now?"
"232026500-0-8152";"What do I need to do then?"
"232026500-0-8160";"What should we do now?"
"232026500-0-8161";"What should we do now?"
"232026500-0-8162";"I've just come from speaking to priestess Kauzanabi-jo."
"232026500-0-8169";"Scholar Zhoreh wants you to send Shiri back to Bergama."
"232026500-0-8178";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-8179";"Are you sure you can find the way?"
"232026500-0-8184";"What shall I do with the matriarch's body?"
"232026500-0-8186";"Do you sing that for everyone?"
"232026500-0-8193";"How did you find me?"
"232026500-0-8194";"Are you coming ashore?"
"232026500-0-8197";"So, I can have the axe?"
"232026500-0-8199";"What will you do?"
"232026500-0-8200";"What now?"
"232026500-0-8213";"He's alive, wounded, but alive."
"232026500-0-8216";"About the sword â€¦."
"232026500-0-8218";"Take the sword back to Cyrodiil."
"232026500-0-8226";"Right. The book?"
"232026500-0-8232";"<Search the backpack.>"
"232026500-0-8233";"<Search the backpack.>"
"232026500-0-8236";"What's next?"
"232026500-0-8237";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-8238";"Is that the last of them?"
"232026500-0-8245";"I have the key that opens the way to the Labyrinth."
"232026500-0-8257";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-8265";"The people you were paid to look for are all dead."
"232026500-0-8266";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-8275";"You are welcome, Ansei Halelah."
"232026500-0-8282";"Thank you. I think we've contained the Dro-m'Athra."
"232026500-0-8289";"It's done. The wispmother is dead."
"232026500-0-8290";"Thank you, Jofnir."
"232026500-0-8293";"That wasn't the tricky part?"
"232026500-0-8296";"Where is everyone?"
"232026500-0-8297";"It's more than spiders. They were taken by a spider Daedra."
"232026500-0-8298";"You don't remember anything? Even <<1>>?"
"232026500-0-8302";"Aldolin is dead."
"232026500-0-8308";"Here it is, but what do you mean?"
"232026500-0-8316";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-8318";"I found her, but she wouldn't return. She's been co-opted by a Bosmer tribe."
"232026500-0-8319";"I found her about to be co-opted into a Bosmer tribe. I convinced her to return."
"232026500-0-8320";"No one else is coming back. Fanrel wants her vengeance."
"232026500-0-8321";"Was this the revenge you wanted?"
"232026500-0-8333";"Dinwenel sent me. She said you could use some help."
"232026500-0-8334";"Sounds like Dinwenel sent me just in time."
"232026500-0-8335";"Dinwenel sent me. She said you could use some help."
"232026500-0-8350";"I have it right here. Manthir says he's done dealing with you."
"232026500-0-8351";"I managed to get the silks."
"232026500-0-8353";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-8354";"Your soul was placed in this body of stone and soil. From you, the Hollow were made."
"232026500-0-8355";"You are the master to which the Hollow are only copies."
"232026500-0-8356";"I found all the items the Artisan stole."
"232026500-0-8372";"Why didn't you tell me Arenthia had been invaded?"
"232026500-0-8373";"What am I supposed to do?"
"232026500-0-8376";"So it's not strange at all the lunar priest knew you'd be here?"
"232026500-0-8380";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-8400";"Yes. I consecrated her remains as you asked."
"232026500-0-8402";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-8403";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-8405";"Yes, I have the ash."
"232026500-0-8406";"I have the ash right here."
"232026500-0-8407";"I have the ash you wanted."
"232026500-0-8408";"Good luck with your music."
"232026500-0-8410";"Thank you, now get out of here."
"232026500-0-8415";"Pellingare deserves a chance. He goes to trial."
"232026500-0-8416";"I have news about your cousin."
"232026500-0-8421";"I was asked to find you. There are dead at Tava's Blessing that need consecration."
"232026500-0-8423";"<<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-8424";"Scout Yanul sent me to help."
"232026500-0-8427";"I've just come from <<1>>. <<2>> sent me. The island was attacked by Maormer."
"232026500-0-8434";"Details from Major Cirenwe and Fariel to bring you up to speed."
"232026500-0-8438";"What we saw â€¦ could it be the future of the Dominion?"
"232026500-0-8439";"I'm proud to stand with you, Shazah."
"232026500-0-8441";"Find <<1>>"
"232026500-0-8447";"Bright Moons, Shazah."
"232026500-0-8453";"It's done. When will you know the results?"
"232026500-0-8455";"What should I do?"
"232026500-0-8476";"I came across the remains of your band and killed the wispmother."
"232026500-0-8483";"Here's the mammoth's tusk as proof of the kill."
"232026500-0-8484";"Here's the troll's arm as proof of the kill."
"232026500-0-8485";"I killed the wasp. Here's its head."
"232026500-0-8488";"Pellingare deserves death. I will look the other way."
"232026500-0-8496";"I'm ready."
"232026500-0-8499";"I'll find a way."
"232026500-0-8500";"I think she wants you to have her sword."
"232026500-0-8501";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-8502";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-8503";"Thank you."
"232026500-0-8516";"As you say, Sai."
"232026500-0-8517";"Here is the Ring of Stendarr's Mercy. The Abbey of Blades was destroyed."
"232026500-0-8521";"You needed to know the truth."
"232026500-0-8522";"She's in a better place now."
"232026500-0-8535";"Your sister? I thought you hated each other."
"232026500-0-8536";"Family? Does that mean your brother is staying?"
"232026500-0-8537";"I have the Tear of Anurraame right here. Take it."
"232026500-0-8553";"Heloise killed Gennove Hinault. She decided to take her own life."
"232026500-0-8554";"Something was wrong with Heloise. She decided to go away to keep people safe."
"232026500-0-8557";"Where am I supposed to go?"
"232026500-0-8560";"<<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-8561";"<<1>> is dead."
"232026500-0-8568";"What am I supposed to do?"
"232026500-0-8578";"The Mages Guild will expect you keep your promise."
"232026500-0-8579";"What will you do now?"
"232026500-0-8605";"I found your notes. The Veiled Heritance was using them to create liches."
"232026500-0-8611";"Yes. You and the tree can both be at peace now."
"232026500-0-8615";"I suppose so."
"232026500-0-8616";"I suppose so."
"232026500-0-8617";"I suppose so."
"232026500-0-8618";"The undead are gone from the ruins?"
"232026500-0-8622";"I found the remains of four members and a note that mentioned you. Here are their rings as proof."
"232026500-0-8623";"I found your contract in Barrow Trench. I have your ingredients."
"232026500-0-8626";"Get out of here."
"232026500-0-8627";"No. I've spoken with him enough."
"232026500-0-8629";"Probably so. I'm here to help."
"232026500-0-8630";"Thank you, Jofnir."
"232026500-0-8632";"Thank you, Jofnir."
"232026500-0-8633";"Thank you, Jofnir."

"232026500-0-8642";"The question is settled now."
"232026500-0-8644";"Yes â€¦ though it's the Wilderqueen now."
"232026500-0-8647";"Is there anything more I can do?"
"232026500-0-8649";"Is this book really going to help us?"
"232026500-0-8650";"Iniel stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"232026500-0-8651";"Iniel stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."

"232026500-0-8653";"And the spell remains intact?"
"232026500-0-8654";"I killed the vampire commander. His name was Maldred."
"232026500-0-8672";"So you didn't know anything about this?"
"232026500-0-8674";"Where did you get the extra coin?"
"232026500-0-8679";"What happens now?"
"232026500-0-8683";"Will you take her back to Evermore yourself?"
"232026500-0-8685";"The queen sent me to see how I can help."

"232026500-0-8727";"Not really. But I fulfilled the contract."
"232026500-0-8728";"Gray Vipers. I've met my quota of them."
"232026500-0-8729";"I cut some down for you."
"232026500-0-8730";"No, but I did fulfill the contract."
"232026500-0-8731";"Your trust is well placed."

"232026500-0-8918";"Do you think that's wise?"
"232026500-0-8923";"Won't the Worm Cult just try to reclaim this place?"
"232026500-0-8927";"What are you going to do now?"

"232026500-0-15217";"I'm sorry, they got away. But I did recover the stolen Redmaiden."
"232026500-0-15218";"Where will you run?"
"232026500-0-15219";"Here, I found this near the body of Mikget."
"232026500-0-15220";"I have the gem Telofasa was sent to retrieve."

"232026500-0-15296";"I'm sorry, they got away."
"232026500-0-15318";"You should be proud of your accomplishments."
"232026500-0-15319";"So both Ordinator Nilera and Priest Sovisa are free?"
"232026500-0-15335";"Is that why I gathered the materials you needed while you wove the basket?"
"232026500-0-15336";"I completed one of the tasks you said Zenithar favors."
"232026500-0-15341";"Of course. Here are the five medallions."
"232026500-0-15342";"At least they don't have High King Emeric, Queen Ayrenn, or Prince Irnskar yet."
"232026500-0-15343";"What about the map?"
"232026500-0-15344";"So now we go to Amenos?"
"232026500-0-15345";"Yes. I retrieved the last of the vulk'esh scoria."

"232026500-0-15701";"What happens now, Raz?"
"232026500-0-15703";"So you can complete your survey of Embervine now?"
"232026500-0-15705";"So what now, Lady Arabelle?"

"232026500-0-15716";"There's a powerful guardian on Y'ffelon. Frii believes they can turn it against the Firesong."
"232026500-0-15717";"Build anew? What do you mean?"
"232026500-0-15720";"I could only choose one of you, Joslin. I chose you."
"232026500-0-15721";"The curse is lifted. You're free, Octin. But we couldn't save Joslin, too."

"232026500-0-15848";"I repaired the shrines and killed the chimera."
"232026500-0-15850";"You don't need to do that, Lady Arabelle."

"232026500-0-15982";"Yes, I have all the ingredients you asked for."
"232026500-0-15983";"You think whatever threatens Hermaeus Mora's realm is in the Telvanni Peninsula?"

"232026500-0-15988";"Meet me at the old Necrom Bindery. I'm working with someone named Leramil the Wise."
"232026500-0-15989";"Hermaeus Mora chose me to help save Apocrypha and Nirn from opposing Daedric Princes."
"232026500-0-15990";"Is there anything else I can do to help, Scruut?"
"232026500-0-15991";"Hermaeus Mora said we could still save reality if we work together, Leramil."
"232026500-0-15992";"I thought Daedric Princes couldn't enter a rival's realm without permission."
"232026500-0-15993";"Right. We should listen to Curate Gadayn's speech. But are you sure we can rest now?"
"232026500-0-15994";"Ulfengar says they will stay, but only if the Consortium meets his demands and cleans the mine."
"232026500-0-15995";"I thought you needed me to free them to cause a distraction?"
"232026500-0-15996";"I burned the corrupted scrolls, but I found Cipher Sabinius dead. He had this blank scroll."
"232026500-0-15997";"Here are the books. Do you know what he has planned?"
"232026500-0-15999";"Here are the relics I found."
"232026500-0-16000";"Solni Nrayn? I have a delivery for you."
"232026500-0-16001";"So you poisoned him?"
"232026500-0-16006";"Before you go, Folsi did promise me something for bringing you that letter."
"232026500-0-16007";"Hermaeus Mora said we had time. The seals won't be easy to break."
"232026500-0-16008";"I wish you the best of luck going forward."
"232026500-0-16009";"It seems like you've thought of everything."
"232026500-0-16010";"You're finally out of the Feral Gallery. How does it feel?"
"232026500-0-16011";"You're welcome."
"232026500-0-16012";"What's that?"
"232026500-0-16013";"It looks like you're finally free."
"232026500-0-16014";"This is for you. <Give Rilasi the replica talisman>"
"232026500-0-16015";"I wish you and Nathyn every happiness together."
"232026500-0-16016";"I'm interested in work. Where do I start?"
"232026500-0-16029";"I cleared Hermaeus Mora's enemies from Bastion Nymic and defeated the Herald."
"232026500-0-16031";"Good luck in your rise to power."
"232026500-0-16032";"Thaddeus needs the glyphic. He shouldn't be long."
"232026500-0-16033";"What's next, Sharp?"
"232026500-0-16034";"And you were able to resist Sondivel's magic."
"232026500-0-16035";"This isn't the end, Sharp. We can still save her."
"232026500-0-16036";"What's next for you, Sharp? Do you think you'll help out Mevei and Federo again?"
"232026500-0-16037";"Sure. Let's keep working together on your project."
"232026500-0-16038";"So back to our travels, then?"
"232026500-0-16039";"I'll be here when you're ready to take on the adversary."
"232026500-0-16040";"I'd like that, Azandar."
"232026500-0-16041";"We freed Hermaeus Mora from Vaermina's dream, but Torvesard recovered part of the memory."
"232026500-0-16045";"Neither Valinna or Mephala will be able to lead the scribes now."
"232026500-0-16046";"What's my reward for defeating Valinna in Scrivener's Hall?"
"232026500-0-16047";"What's my reward for defeating Valiina in Scrivener's Hall?"
"232026500-0-16048";"What's my reward for defeating Valinna in Scrivener's Hall?"
"232026500-0-16055";"These are for you. <Give Rilasi the real and replica talismans>"
"232026500-0-16061";"So you're all set to put on your show?"
"232026500-0-16062";"Ulfengar and the others are leaving. They can't trust the Consortium to keep them or Necrom safe."
"232026500-0-16113";"I will leave the spell to you."
"232026500-0-16114";"I will leave the spell to you."
"232026500-0-16116";"Be careful with that prism."
"232026500-0-16121";"I wish you luck in finding a cure."
"232026500-0-16145";"Is it over?"
"232026500-0-16146";"Is it over?"
"232026500-0-16147";"Is it over?"
"232026500-0-16148";"I found the Dreamstone."
"232026500-0-16149";"I found this Dreamstone."
"232026500-0-16150";"Here, I found the Whispering Dreamstone. It wasn't easy to recover."
"232026500-0-16151";"I'll talk to Twelvane."
"232026500-0-16157";"I recovered these kwama eggs."
"232026500-0-16160";"I recovered the missing merchandise."

"232026500-0-16165";"I gathered the Dremnaken teeth."
"232026500-0-16167";"I gathered the ship manifests you asked for."
"232026500-0-16182";"I defeated Vro-Kuul-Sha. Here are the personal effects of the fallen Armigers."
"232026500-0-16184";"The Walking Nightmare has been taken care of, and I collected the research notes."
"232026500-0-16186";"I defeated Valkynaz Dek and rescued the captives."
"232026500-0-16188";"I dispatched the Prime Cataloger. Here are the molted skins from several of its tomeshells."
"232026500-0-16190";"I defeated Runemaster Xiomara and collected the arcane residue from the warriors."
"232026500-0-16192";"I killed Corlys the Chainmaker and placed your mystic trackers on his caraven."
"232026500-0-16226";"Before you go, Folsi did promise me something for bringing you that letter."
"232026500-0-16243";"Glad I could help."
"232026500-0-16246";"I hope the order rebuilds successfully."
"232026500-0-16261";"You seem concerned."
"232026500-0-16262";"I've got the book I found in Cipher Dreyla's pack."
