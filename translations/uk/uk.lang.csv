"228103012-0-8950";"Can I ask you some questions?"
"228103012-0-8957";"I'm risking my life to protect your stables. What aid can you offer me?"
"228103012-0-8970";"Tell me about the Wyrd Tree."
"228103012-0-8972";"What should I do with this creature?"
"228103012-0-8973";"Who are you? Do you live in Deleyn's Mill?"
"228103012-0-8974";"Why do the Wyrd care so much about saving these people?"
"228103012-0-8981";"Was that supposed to happen?"
"228103012-0-8983";"Your mages have opened a door into the past."
"228103012-0-8991";"No, but I have the other reagents you asked for."
"228103012-0-8997";"Don't worry, Your Majesty. Everything will work out."
"228103012-0-9000";"What's your group doing out here?"
"228103012-0-9006";"You can run away. I'll stay here and fight."
"228103012-0-9016";"I've learned the recipe."
"228103012-0-9018";"I'm not sure what's going on."
"228103012-0-9021";"Here are the Alessian orders."
"228103012-0-9023";"Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?"
"228103012-0-9026";"Take the soldiers and kill Faolchu. I'll rescue Alana."
"228103012-0-9027";"I'll deal with Faolchu. See if you can find Alana."
"228103012-0-9028";"I sent the remaining troops to kill him."
"228103012-0-9037";"You're a woman."
"228103012-0-9041";"Alana? Is that really you?"
"228103012-0-9042";"I found this amulet on a fallen Ash'abah warrior."
"228103012-0-9046";"Come with me."
"228103012-0-9049";"I think so."
"228103012-0-9053";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-9057";"I have learned the recipe."
"228103012-0-9059";"I have learned the recipe, Great Sage."
"228103012-0-9067";"Do you know why they took the regalia?"
"228103012-0-9069";"Who was the Iron Son?"
"228103012-0-9070";"Who was this Golden Prince?"
"228103012-0-9071";"Who was the Ivory Lord?"
"228103012-0-9072";"Who was the Emerald Princess?"
"228103012-0-9086";"It's done. Your spectral knights are free."
"228103012-0-9088";"I'll keep you safe. Just destroy those vines."
"228103012-0-9096";"What can you tell me about the Tears of the Dishonored?"
"228103012-0-9097";"It's time to set the elemental guardians free."
"228103012-0-9099";"You must have seen this ritual performed many times. What's the correct order?"
"228103012-0-9100";"How did the Withered Hand corrupt the temple?"
"228103012-0-9102";"I'll keep you safe. Destroy the vines."
"228103012-0-9103";"I'm here to protect you. Are you ready?"
"228103012-0-9104";"I'll make sure you have the time you need to destroy the vines."
"228103012-0-9107";"Yes. She said her contingent is intact and ready to fight."
"228103012-0-9108";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-9109";"What requirement?"
"228103012-0-9110";"Slow down. Tell me what's going on."
"228103012-0-9111";"What'll we do when we get to them?"
"228103012-0-9116";"Let's move out!"
"228103012-0-9117";"That's what one of the guards told me. Sound like you need a plan."
"228103012-0-9119";"I'm ready to escort your recruit."
"228103012-0-9122";"The Duke suggested you could help me capture a werewolf."
"228103012-0-9128";"Commander Ales sent me to help you."
"228103012-0-9138";"You're one of the women from Camlorn?"
"228103012-0-9150";"Can I ask some questions?"
"228103012-0-9163";"I need another disguise."
"228103012-0-9170";"How do I do research?"
"228103012-0-9173";"I have learned the recipe."
"228103012-0-9175";"I have."
"228103012-0-9177";"I've learned the recipe."
"228103012-0-9180";"How do I do research?"
"228103012-0-9181";"How do I do research?"
"228103012-0-9187";"Do you know where your brother is?"
"228103012-0-9193";"I came here looking for you. Why aren't you at the wedding?"
"228103012-0-9199";"The Lion Guard holds the courtyard. Your father sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-9200";"NYI - TOC"
"228103012-0-9201";"NYI - TOC"
"228103012-0-9203";"I came to talk about Casnar at-Tarin."
"228103012-0-9205";"Actually, I take issue with you. Casnar's just a good excuse to give you a few new scars."
"228103012-0-9208";"That seems reasonable enough."
"228103012-0-9212";"I have more questions."
"228103012-0-9216";"You knew I was coming?"
"228103012-0-9218";"Can't I just find your father?"
"228103012-0-9221";"I'm ready to prove myself."
"228103012-0-9222";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-9223";"I have."
"228103012-0-9231";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"228103012-0-9233";"Don't lie. You helped the Imperials, didn't you?"
"228103012-0-9243";"Why don't the cultists attack you?"
"228103012-0-9257";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-9258";"I'm here to help you."
"228103012-0-9259";"What should I do?"
"228103012-0-9267";"I still don't understand why you joined the cult."
"228103012-0-9271";"Your great-great-grandson asked me to place the candles."
"228103012-0-9274";"Why are the Lion Guard here?"
"228103012-0-9275";"Save your insults for the Bloodthorns. I'm here to rescue you."
"228103012-0-9277";"What next?"
"228103012-0-9279";"I have learned the recipe."
"228103012-0-9282";"Who was Sir Granden?"
"228103012-0-9284";"Tamien told me to find you."
"228103012-0-9285";"I have the ingredients for your werewolf cure."
"228103012-0-9291";"The spell is broken."
"228103012-0-9292";"Get to the inn. It's safe there."
"228103012-0-9293";"Get to the inn. It's safe there."
"228103012-0-9295";"No. I can't risk it. But I won't kill you. Gloria, capture him!"
"228103012-0-9296";"Your Grace, we know you have the curse."
"228103012-0-9298";"General Gautier's troops are right behind me. I cleared a path for them."
"228103012-0-9302";"Tell me about your tribe."
"228103012-0-9303";"How did Marimah become the leader of the Ash'abah?"
"228103012-0-9304";"What's the history of your tribe?"
"228103012-0-9309";"Why are you looking for harpy eggs?"
"228103012-0-9310";"How do I set you free?"
"228103012-0-9312";"Tell me more about the spell you want me to cast."
"228103012-0-9313";"I have questions about the Midnight Talisman."
"228103012-0-9325";"Why is it important to find out how Faolchu died?"
"228103012-0-9326";"What do you know about the new guard captain?"
"228103012-0-9331";"Can you explain what we're about to do?"
"228103012-0-9334";"What can you tell me about the Battle of Glenumbra Moors?"
"228103012-0-9338";"Can I ask you about the war?"
"228103012-0-9351";"One of your sisters asked me to find you."
"228103012-0-9353";"You said the desert belongs to the dead?"
"228103012-0-9356";"What happened? Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-9367";"It was a Dremora. Is the talisman all right?"
"228103012-0-9386";"I'm here to help. What happened?"
"228103012-0-9405";"What news is there from the surrounding lands?"
"228103012-0-9409";"Your pig was in an alley, chewing on a strange vine."
"228103012-0-9412";"I have some questions about these vines."
"228103012-0-9429";"We're here to help. Are you all right in there?"
"228103012-0-9432";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"228103012-0-9433";"What is the Bloodthorn cult?"
"228103012-0-9434";"Who is Angof?"
"228103012-0-9435";"Stibbons sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-9438";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-9440";"What's a lurcher?"
"228103012-0-9446";"<Take the Ansei Ward.>"
"228103012-0-9453";"You're not coming with me?"
"228103012-0-9459";"What happened to the wyrd?"
"228103012-0-9462";"I have some questions, Chamberlain."
"228103012-0-9492";"What should I do next?"
"228103012-0-9495";"Is the cure ready?"
"228103012-0-9497";"I'd prefer one skilled in restoration magic."
"228103012-0-9500";"I'd prefer one skilled in swordplay."
"228103012-0-9504";"What do you want me to do?"
"228103012-0-9509";"You expect me to take on Faolchu by myself?"
"228103012-0-9516";"<Examine the tome.>"
"228103012-0-9525";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-9526";"Who was Leki?"
"228103012-0-9531";"Yes. Please continue."
"228103012-0-9534";"Yes. Go on."
"228103012-0-9537";"Go on."
"228103012-0-9541";"Go on."
"228103012-0-9544";"How's Faolchu going to know the portal is open?"
"228103012-0-9545";"Did I pass the spirits' test?"
"228103012-0-9553";"How would I prove myself?"
"228103012-0-9555";"What can you teach me?"
"228103012-0-9561";"I'm listening."
"228103012-0-9566";"Yes, I'm ready."
"228103012-0-9568";"What do you know about <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-9570";"Do you know of <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-9572";"I came to ask about <<1>>."
"228103012-0-9574";"I'm ready to answer your riddle."
"228103012-0-9581";"I'm willing to learn."
"228103012-0-9583";"You're one of Gennove's sons? I'm here to rescue you."
"228103012-0-9586";"These knights wish to raise your grandson as a revenant, according with his wishes."
"228103012-0-9588";"The Queen has offered her services against the Imperials in place of raising Prince Adrien."
"228103012-0-9589";"I will accept your offer. You're right, we cannot continue with this necromantic ritual."
"228103012-0-9590";"<<1>> was right. We will need his strength to defeat the Imperials."
"228103012-0-9595";"How do I return to the present?"
"228103012-0-9601";"Don't worry. I'm here to help you."
"228103012-0-9605";"Is what <<1>> says true? You're not trying to stop the undead here at all?"
"228103012-0-9607";"I'd like to see what's in the hold of your ship."
"228103012-0-9620";"So you really think fate determines every action we take?"
"228103012-0-9622";"I have questions about the treasure and the ruins."
"228103012-0-9629";"<Remove the tile.>"
"228103012-0-9630";"<Remove the tile.>"
"228103012-0-9631";"<Remove the tile.>"

"228103012-0-9640";"<Remove the tile.>"
"228103012-0-9662";"Goblins? Is that what you're researching?"
"228103012-0-9679";"Where did you get this badge?"
"228103012-0-9680";"<Check Dusant's backpack for suitable offerings.>"
"228103012-0-9685";"<Check Dusant's backpack for a suitable offering.>"
"228103012-0-9690";"<Examine the contents of Dusant's backpack for an offering.>"
"228103012-0-9691";"Here's your alchemical equipment."
"228103012-0-9695";"What are you doing down here?"
"228103012-0-9702";"Notes?"
"228103012-0-9707";"I found them."
"228103012-0-9715";"Now about your master key …?"
"228103012-0-9722";"Where have you been?"
"228103012-0-9727";"What's that?"
"228103012-0-9731";"No. I was trying to stop them."
"228103012-0-9735";"Why did they come to Tava's Blessing?"
"228103012-0-9736";"I have learned the reicpe."
"228103012-0-9738";"It was a group effort."
"228103012-0-9740";"And the potion is ready?"
"228103012-0-9745";"What's the plan now?"
"228103012-0-9761";"Where are the Lion Guard soldiers?"
"228103012-0-9764";"How? We've lost so many already."
"228103012-0-9766";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"228103012-0-9769";"What do you propose?"
"228103012-0-9771";"What do you suggest we do?"
"228103012-0-9775";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-9776";"Where do you think Angof is hiding?"
"228103012-0-9780";"Do you have worm's head caps?"
"228103012-0-9781";"Do you have any flame stalks?"
"228103012-0-9786";"Do you have any worm stalk caps?"
"228103012-0-9787";"Do you have any flame stalk caps?"
"228103012-0-9789";"That's a big lizard."
"228103012-0-9796";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-9800";"Let's look for him then."
"228103012-0-9801";"Are you well enough to continue?"
"228103012-0-9831";"Why are you helping Elara?"
"228103012-0-9891";"I'm here to help. You need to convince the townsfolk to follow Tamien Sellan."
"228103012-0-9898";"The way is clear. Find <<1>> near the dockhouse."
"228103012-0-9906";"Yes. Let's go."
"228103012-0-9907";"The Red Rooks killed the mayor of Crosswych?"
"228103012-0-9909";"Get to safety. I'll take care of the wolves."
"228103012-0-9910";"I'm not a Red Rook. I'm here to stop them."
"228103012-0-9911";"I have learned the reicpe."
"228103012-0-9913";"Why do you seek revenge?"
"228103012-0-9915";"Q3333: Text not visible to the PC."
"228103012-0-9916";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-9924";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-9925";"Why is this man tied up? Is he a criminal?"
"228103012-0-9930";"What's going on outside of Evermore?"
"228103012-0-9933";"So Evermore is under Sir Renchant's rule?"
"228103012-0-9936";"What is the blessing for?"
"228103012-0-9957";"Where should I look for your soldiers?"
"228103012-0-9964";"I think it has something to do with this talisman. Why aren't you affected?"
"228103012-0-9968";"How do you know Uwafa?"
"228103012-0-9969";"Could you tell me more about the pearl?"
"228103012-0-9970";"Walking stone? Is that poetic or literal?"
"228103012-0-9972";"You don't know?"
"228103012-0-9993";"I'm here to help the resistance."
"228103012-0-10003";"I have a few questions."
"228103012-0-10006";"Ah"
"228103012-0-10009";"Can I ask a few questions?"
"228103012-0-10010";"What can I do to help?"
"228103012-0-10014";"Are you sure it was Heloise?"
"228103012-0-10026";"I was sent to help you with the Withered Hand."
"228103012-0-10041";"Here are the amulets I acquired."
"228103012-0-10046";"Then let's go."
"228103012-0-10052";"Let's begin."
"228103012-0-10055";"Who were the Nedic Peoples?"
"228103012-0-10058";"I've never heard of giant Goblins."
"228103012-0-10061";"Tell me of Orsinium."
"228103012-0-10066";"Sabine Lancarl wants us to report on Imperial activity to the south."
"228103012-0-10075";"Yes. What is it you want me to do?"
"228103012-0-10076";"He will cheat. You will watch for treachery unless you wish to be at war with the Fighters Guild."
"228103012-0-10079";"<<1>> sent me to end the talks."
"228103012-0-10082";"I'm no coward. I'm here to ensure that you never ally with the Withered Hand."
"228103012-0-10086";"Give up now. I will not let you enslave these people, too."
"228103012-0-10089";"You are correct."
"228103012-0-10092";"Wait a minute. Is that really fair?"
"228103012-0-10093";"Others?"
"228103012-0-10103";"Let's continue our patrol."
"228103012-0-10104";"Sure. Let's capture an Imperial again."
"228103012-0-10105";"What happened down here?"
"228103012-0-10108";"What does that mean?"
"228103012-0-10109";"You know me?"
"228103012-0-10114";"Do you see now? The Withered Hand are not to be trusted."
"228103012-0-10121";"Do you have any idea how the spell works?"
"228103012-0-10141";"What's your role in the King's Guard?"
"228103012-0-10144";"Who are the King's Guard?"
"228103012-0-10146";"I'm not sure this test proved your claims."
"228103012-0-10147";"What guardians? Tell me what you've seen."
"228103012-0-10149";"Yes, I suppose you're right."
"228103012-0-10151";"You seem to be badly hurt. These herbs might help you."
"228103012-0-10152";"<<1>>, I need to speak to you."
"228103012-0-10162";"One of your soldiers sent me."
"228103012-0-10167";"I hear you're looking for reinforcements."

"228103012-0-15404";"You must have found something to do for fun around here."
"228103012-0-15406";"Did you see anything suspicious during the race?"
"228103012-0-15408";"Prince Irnskar asked me to speak with you."
"228103012-0-15419";"I charged Viper's Strike for you."
"228103012-0-15421";"I defeated the Stormfist commander."
"228103012-0-15422";"What's the matter?"
"228103012-0-15423";"You seem very devoted to training."
"228103012-0-15429";"I've seen your family name before."
"228103012-0-15437";"Do you really kill Mages Guild members?"
"228103012-0-15438";"What happened up here?"
"228103012-0-15439";"I'm reporting as ordered."
"228103012-0-15440";"Walks-In-Ash sent me to help you."
"228103012-0-15445";"Let me in. I have important information for the captain."
"228103012-0-15447";"Let me in. I have important information for the captain."
"228103012-0-15450";"Where did you come from?"
"228103012-0-15452";"I'm new to the war. I was told to speak with you."
"228103012-0-15453";"Will lighting a few fires really help?"
"228103012-0-15454";"Are you all right, King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-15461";"Hello."
"228103012-0-15464";"Where did you last see your friend?"
"228103012-0-15471";"I've come to kill that Orc."
"228103012-0-15472";"What else"
"228103012-0-15473";"The watchfires are lit."
"228103012-0-15475";"Snap out of it. Aranya's worried sick about you."
"228103012-0-15476";"What's wrong?"
"228103012-0-15477";"What is Lukiul Uxith?"
"228103012-0-15485";"Can you tell me anything about the Brothers of Strife?"
"228103012-0-15486";"Of course, Seyne."
"228103012-0-15489";"Who are you? Why did you send me a contract to kill Armando?"
"228103012-0-15492";"You're ready for the Covenant?"
"228103012-0-15493";"You and Runs-in-Wild seem to be getting along."
"228103012-0-15494";"How do we look?"
"228103012-0-15495";"Hmmm…I…uh…"
"228103012-0-15500";"Someone said he likes to drink wine."
"228103012-0-15504";"People have been complaining about rats."
"228103012-0-15508";"Someone told me he is paranoid about fires, as a fire wiped out his wares recently."
"228103012-0-15512";"I was hoping you'd answer some questions."
"228103012-0-15515";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-15527";"What can you tell me about the Brothers of Strife?"
"228103012-0-15530";"What do you know about <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-15531";"Prince Irnskar would like you to attend the war council."
"228103012-0-15537";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-15539";"King Jorunn wants you to know that he's in control."
"228103012-0-15543";"He doesn't look like a monster to me."
"228103012-0-15544";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-15545";"What do you mean, spreading?"
"228103012-0-15546";"You said heresy. Have you upset the Three?"
"228103012-0-15547";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-15550";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-15553";"King Jorunn, Thane Harvald asked me to give you this."
"228103012-0-15554";"So I should return the old Nord cup to this chamber?"
"228103012-0-15557";"Prince Irnskar sent me to talk to you."
"228103012-0-15564";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-15566";"What can you tell me about this book?"
"228103012-0-15568";"Here's the mead you asked for."
"228103012-0-15570";"What is it?"
"228103012-0-15574";"Rumor has it that he runs Poison for the Blacksails."
"228103012-0-15578";"So I got this uniform, now I'll just try to blend it."
"228103012-0-15582";"Heard the key to the Storeroom is in the First Mate's Strongbox, but he doesn't let people near it."
"228103012-0-15586";"You're a spy from the Aldmeri Dominon."
"228103012-0-15587";"There's Black Spittle on board. They plan on using it on someone in town."
"228103012-0-15591";"So, uhhh, what should I do?"
"228103012-0-15595";"Ok, I'm here."
"228103012-0-15596";"Let Eiman go."
"228103012-0-15599";"Very funny, I'm here, so let's get started."
"228103012-0-15602";"Me too. I got bored herding Guar. So where is <<1>> anyway?"
"228103012-0-15604";"Sounds like Markus is hiding in his basement."
"228103012-0-15608";"Sounds like Markus has some poison in the basement."
"228103012-0-15612";"So, uhhh, what should I do?"
"228103012-0-15614";"I'm with you. Can't people clean up now and again? I know we're theives, but come on."
"228103012-0-15615";"Who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-15617";"Covenant soldiers? Here?"
"228103012-0-15636";"You wanted to speak to me?"
"228103012-0-15639";"How is the Skald-King doing?"
"228103012-0-15641";"What's next?"
"228103012-0-15665";"Where will you hold the war council?"
"228103012-0-15666";"If you tell me what's wrong, I may be able to help."
"228103012-0-15668";"Do you have any mead you'd be willing to part with?"
"228103012-0-15669";"Do you have any mead you'd be willing to part with?"
"228103012-0-15670";"Telvanni?"
"228103012-0-15671";"You don't remember anything?"
"228103012-0-15675";"What now?"
"228103012-0-15678";"This place is teeming with Guards, any advice?"
"228103012-0-15679";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-15681";"Yes, they spoke of a battle. They were generals in it."
"228103012-0-15682";"Where can I find Bitterblade?"
"228103012-0-15684";"Are you ready for this?"
"228103012-0-15685";"<Poke the giant.>"
"228103012-0-15689";"What's going on? Where am I?"
"228103012-0-15692";"Are you Lorak? Eveline sent me."
"228103012-0-15698";"What can you tell me about the Dark Brotherhood?"
"228103012-0-15700";"Hey, seems like you're hitting the drinks a bit heavy."
"228103012-0-15702";"Anything you can tell me about this place?"
"228103012-0-15705";"I hope so. I've been burning his roots."
"228103012-0-15711";"I was at the Harvest Festival. How did I get here?"
"228103012-0-15717";"I heard the royal work crew needs a break."
"228103012-0-15719";"Berj told me to decide which meal to serve at the party."
"228103012-0-15721";"Berj sent me over. He wants me to decide what to serve at the party."
"228103012-0-15725";"Here's the goat you wanted."
"228103012-0-15726";"The cooks said you have the key to the storeroom."
"228103012-0-15731";"Here's some more mead for the party."
"228103012-0-15733";"No trouble at all."
"228103012-0-15734";"You seem to really like wolves."
"228103012-0-15736";"Everyone's hoping to hear a song or two."
"228103012-0-15743";"What do you mean, play the part?"
"228103012-0-15745";"How can I stop <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-15750";"The Silvenar? How did you get in here?"
"228103012-0-15752";"Don't worry, you're safe now."
"228103012-0-15756";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-15757";"What will you do now, Rana?"
"228103012-0-15758";"What will you do now, Darj?"
"228103012-0-15772";"How did this conflict start?"
"228103012-0-15778";"I'm sorry I was too late to save you."
"228103012-0-15782";"How do I do that?"
"228103012-0-15786";"And what task is that?"
"228103012-0-15788";"What did you do on Bleakrock?"
"228103012-0-15789";"<<1>> asked me to investigate what happened."
"228103012-0-15791";"Did you see what happened?"
"228103012-0-15792";"Have you received any orders yet?"
"228103012-0-15795";"Do you really need to lock her up?"
"228103012-0-15796";"What are you hoping for from command?"
"228103012-0-15798";"Sir Cadwell? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-15799";"Was locking her up necessary?"
"228103012-0-15800";"Was locking her up necessary?"
"228103012-0-15801";"Was locking her up necessary?"
"228103012-0-15802";"Was locking her up necessary?"
"228103012-0-15809";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-15812";"Do you remember how you were injured?"
"228103012-0-15814";"Did you see who attacked you?"
"228103012-0-15818";"You thinking of rejoining the Fighters Guild?"
"228103012-0-15823";"What kind of trouble?"
"228103012-0-15824";"I'd like to help."
"228103012-0-15829";"Hold still. You've lost a lot of blood."
"228103012-0-15835";"Are you the guardian of Ouze?"
"228103012-0-15837";"I saved a few villagers, but Dalaneth is still missing."
"228103012-0-15843";"Where are you headed, Darj?"
"228103012-0-15854";"<Examine the broken blade.>"
"228103012-0-15855";"And what do we do after that?"
"228103012-0-15856";"<Examine the rock.>"
"228103012-0-15857";"Valeric mentioned you have a plan to save the hunters."
"228103012-0-15859";"People remember having fun, then listening to the bard. Then they were attacked."
"228103012-0-15862";"Valeric mentioned that you could help me with the poachers."
"228103012-0-15863";"Have you seen a bard?"
"228103012-0-15864";"Valeric mentioned that you could help me with the poachers."
"228103012-0-15866";"I'm looking for Valding the Bard."

"228103012-0-15871";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-15888";"I'm not sure what I should do with you."
"228103012-0-15889";"The bard was a thief. His enchanted lute attracted the rieklings."
"228103012-0-15892";"Where did you come from?"
"228103012-0-15905";"Come with me before the Hound corrupts you as well."
"228103012-0-15907";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-15908";"I want to ask you something before I go."
"228103012-0-15915";"It seems so."

"228103012-0-15968";"Indraseth is responsible for the Hound."
"228103012-0-15971";"Yes, go ahead."
"228103012-0-15973";"I brought you information about using soul gems."
"228103012-0-15976";"I brought you maps of Dwarven ruins."
"228103012-0-15980";"What did you do?"
"228103012-0-15985";"Your father had a lot of followers. Are you worried about them?"
"228103012-0-15988";"She wanted to fight the ancients. That's why she lost control."
"228103012-0-15993";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-15994";"Do you remember the attack?"
"228103012-0-15995";"Why have you called me here?"

"228103012-0-16000";"Why have you called me here?"
"228103012-0-16002";"How will you clear the path?"
"228103012-0-16008";"I've brought you their entrails."
"228103012-0-16009";"I can't let this bloodshed continue."
"228103012-0-16014";"And what now? The hunters are dead. Valeric is no longer a threat."
"228103012-0-16015";"And what now? The poachers are dead. Valeric is no threat."
"228103012-0-16016";"And what now? The poachers are dead. Valeric is no threat."
"228103012-0-16017";"The deed is done, just as you asked."
"228103012-0-16027";"Is the Skald-King here?"
"228103012-0-16036";"Before I do anything, I need some questions answered."
"228103012-0-16048";"Do you really believe this offering will bring a good harvest?"
"228103012-0-16050";"Do you always let strangers participate in the festival?"
"228103012-0-16051";"Tell me about High Kinlord Rilis."
"228103012-0-16052";"Why did the Ternions offer to aid the Skald-King?"
"228103012-0-16059";"Join you for what?"
"228103012-0-16060";"I can save King Jorunn."

"228103012-0-16070";"Prince Irnskar sent me to talk to you."
"228103012-0-16089";"Why did you stop working as a hired blade?"
"228103012-0-16095";"What exactly is this plan?"
"228103012-0-16097";"Why keep the gate closed?"
"228103012-0-16104";"Are you ready?"
"228103012-0-16109";"Eyes-of-Steel asked me to challenge Hald Bitterblade."
"228103012-0-16112";"I brought a Dreamwalker to help."

"228103012-0-16175";"You must be Jomund."
"228103012-0-16178";"Where did you hide the notes and the ore sample?"
"228103012-0-16201";"King Jorunn knows something is wrong. He's trying to escape, but he doesn't know how."
"228103012-0-16203";"Jorunn believes his sister is alive. He chases her through his dreams."
"228103012-0-16211";"One of us must die? Why?"
"228103012-0-16212";"You've been poisoned. The Argonian was trying to heal you."
"228103012-0-16215";"One of us must die? Why?"
"228103012-0-16216";"You need to get out of here. This is a trap."
"228103012-0-16229";"What will the spell do?"
"228103012-0-16231";"It had to be done. Now what do we need to do?"
"228103012-0-16232";"What can you tell me about Stormhold?"
"228103012-0-16235";"A choice had to be made. What do I do next?"
"228103012-0-16236";"What can you tell me about Stormhold?"
"228103012-0-16241";"You surrender?"
"228103012-0-16242";"Yes. It's almost time for the miners to make their move."
"228103012-0-16247";"That's right. Go find Eitaki."
"228103012-0-16248";"Fildgor is dead. I saved your sister's spirit and the Crown of Freydis."
"228103012-0-16249";"Your sister's spirit and the Crown are safe. Fildgor awaits your judgment."
"228103012-0-16259";"I have a question."
"228103012-0-16262";"The King knows he's in his own mind, but he won't give up."

"228103012-0-18015";"I think they're telling me which doors to go through."

"228103012-0-18018";"Captain Viveka sent me. I'm here to help."

"228103012-0-18022";"I wanted to ask you something."
"228103012-0-18027";"Can I ask you something?"
"228103012-0-18028";"Can I ask you something?"
"228103012-0-18029";"May I ask you a question?"
"228103012-0-18032";"And that's unusual?"
"228103012-0-18035";"I have a question for you."
"228103012-0-18039";"You've heard of Bar-Neeus?"
"228103012-0-18040";"Elenwen said you were the betrayer!"
"228103012-0-18043";"Have you been attacked recently?"
"228103012-0-18046";"I understand. You had no choice."
"228103012-0-18047";"I understand. You had no choice."
"228103012-0-18050";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-18052";"You sure he's the only one in there?"
"228103012-0-18054";"What've the cultists been doing?"
"228103012-0-18055";"No. You were expecting him?"
"228103012-0-18062";"How have you been, Aera?"
"228103012-0-18067";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-18072";"Nice to see you again."
"228103012-0-18074";"Can you describe what happened?"
"228103012-0-18082";"I'm not here to fight you. Just come with me—"

"228103012-0-18110";"What makes you think the mercenaries plan to turn against you?"
"228103012-0-18116";"Aera, I was attacked in Betar-Nes's home. The cult knows I'm here."
"228103012-0-18118";"That's right. Can you walk?"
"228103012-0-18119";"Hendil had you on his list. Said to give you some salve?"
"228103012-0-18121";"Hendil sent me. I have this salve—"
"228103012-0-18122";"Hendil sent me. I have some salve for you?"
"228103012-0-18124";"How did Estre do this?"
"228103012-0-18128";"You spoke like you know Razum-dar?"

"228103012-0-18172";"What now?"
"228103012-0-18173";"What's this memorial you spoke of?"
"228103012-0-18175";"Where did your Grandfather get a blade like that?"
"228103012-0-18177";"Recognize this sword, Thorulf?"
"228103012-0-18186";"She's sending her men to the werewolves as we speak."
"228103012-0-18194";"Are you feeling better?"
"228103012-0-18196";"If you don't drink, your cover is as good as blown."

"228103012-0-18229";"Here they are."
"228103012-0-18233";"Why is Hendil's home under guard?"
"228103012-0-18234";"I'm not sick. But I do need to get in there."
"228103012-0-18237";"You're being manipulated, Merion. It's some kind of spirit."
"228103012-0-18238";"You're safe now, I think. Do you still want to marry that thing?"

"228103012-0-18244";"My friend in the Mages Guild … she wants more than a book of drinking songs."
"228103012-0-18251";"I know. Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-18252";"Sorry, it's not for sale. Who's Sanessalmo?"
"228103012-0-18256";"I met your assistant. So this was all your fault!"
"228103012-0-18257";"What will you do with your grandfather's body?"
"228103012-0-18258";"I'm sorry, Velatosse. I found a journal while I was searching Hendil's home."
"228103012-0-18260";"Hendil and Amuur dragged you down here. They just ran off."
"228103012-0-18262";"What are you talking about? What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-18265";"To protect him? What about all these people?"
"228103012-0-18270";"What now?"
"228103012-0-18271";"Hendil's salve was a drug. He was feeding people to his son Tancano—a vampire."
"228103012-0-18274";"I don't want to spend that much. Anywhere I can get something a little less expensive?"
"228103012-0-18281";"Is Windhelm always this busy?"
"228103012-0-18282";"Why are you smiling?"

"228103012-0-18297";"Is it always so crowded?"
"228103012-0-18299";"What will you do now, Hallfrida?"
"228103012-0-18300";"Where can I find Thane Mera?"
"228103012-0-18301";"Do you craft the armor yourself?"
"228103012-0-18303";"There's a temple to Sanguine in the area?"
"228103012-0-18306";"Where did the Daedric influence come from?"
"228103012-0-18314";"What should I do with the shard, Ysgramor?"
"228103012-0-18318";"I think it was a success."
"228103012-0-18319";"Won't you and the guard investigate Yiri's story?"
"228103012-0-18323";"Explain yourself. Why do all of this?"
"228103012-0-18326";"The animals of the grove grew violent. To protect the village, Merormo turned everyone to stone."
"228103012-0-18328";"This valley is an unusual place."
"228103012-0-18336";"Ready as I'll ever be."
"228103012-0-18337";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"228103012-0-18339";"You're trying to impress someone?"
"228103012-0-18341";"What's good here?"
"228103012-0-18343";"Um, you're a Khajiit?"
"228103012-0-18344";"I heard the Mages Guild is interested in books."
"228103012-0-18345";"What do you know about Dremora?"
"228103012-0-18346";"There sure are a lot of snakes around here."
"228103012-0-18350";"This is the only way?"
"228103012-0-18355";"How would you do that?"
"228103012-0-18362";"Why single out Bar-Neeus?"
"228103012-0-18365";"Why Bronorr?"
"228103012-0-18366";"What will you do now, Centurion?"
"228103012-0-18367";"Teldur is dead, but he was no traitor. It was Canonreeve Valano all along."
"228103012-0-18369";"Where are the other members of the Queen's entourage?"
"228103012-0-18371";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-18372";"Those are unusual ingredients for an Altmer brewmaster, aren't they?"
"228103012-0-18375";"What's your hurry?"
"228103012-0-18381";"Take <<1>> to Anvil."
"228103012-0-18394";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-18396";"Who is High Kinlord Rilis?"

"228103012-0-18404";"What do you know about Mehrunes Dagon?"
"228103012-0-18406";"So you support the Veiled Heritance?"
"228103012-0-18408";"What do you think about the issues between Estre and Ayrenn?"
"228103012-0-18410";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-18415";"They'll transport you to Anvil for a share of the treasure."
"228103012-0-18418";"Are you interested in the King's festival?"
"228103012-0-18419";"Are you related to the blades merchant?"
"228103012-0-18420";"Are you competing in the Konunleikar?"
"228103012-0-18421";"Khammo offers you his prized fish bones from his treasure trove."
"228103012-0-18426";"I spoke with <<1>>."
"228103012-0-18433";"I did what I could for the people of Silsailen."
"228103012-0-18438";"Can we win this war?"
"228103012-0-18439";"Can we win this war?"
"228103012-0-18440";"Where's the best place to get a drink around here?"
"228103012-0-18441";"Sorry, I'm not from around here."
"228103012-0-18444";"I found this letter addressed to you. Who's Rilyn?"
"228103012-0-18446";"Are you all right? I just spoke with someone who told me you had your cane stolen."
"228103012-0-18448";"I'll check the valley for anything unusual."
"228103012-0-18452";"I found your journal. You murdered the Frostmoons!"
"228103012-0-18456";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-18462";"And the scout knows where the cultists are?"
"228103012-0-18463";"Have you seen the Silvenar before?"
"228103012-0-18465";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-18475";"You couldn't have known."
"228103012-0-18476";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-18477";"How can I help?"
"228103012-0-18479";"Who are you? Where are you?"
"228103012-0-18481";"I dug up the chests, but they were filled with junk."
"228103012-0-18485";"You know where the city is?"
"228103012-0-18493";"I'm at the Queen's service."
"228103012-0-18494";"That looks a lot like the portal the Daedra were coming through."
"228103012-0-18497";"What happened to the other prisoners?"
"228103012-0-18499";"I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to free you."
"228103012-0-18501";"Nothing will come through that portal but more Daedra."
"228103012-0-18515";"I'm supposed to tell you <<1>> sent me."
"228103012-0-18519";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-18520";"Will you be all right?"
"228103012-0-18521";"What about Raerana?"
"228103012-0-18522";"When did Raerana and Jorald get here?"
"228103012-0-18523";"What'll you do now?"
"228103012-0-18524";"Tell me about Vikonn."
"228103012-0-18525";"Tell me about Flavia."
"228103012-0-18526";"Tell me about Pria."
"228103012-0-18527";"So you were close to Svein?"
"228103012-0-18528";"I'm supposed to tell you <<1>> sent me."
"228103012-0-18531";"I found them, but the burglar was already dead."
"228103012-0-18532";"I found some salted meat. I think it's been poisoned."
"228103012-0-18538";"Did you see what happened?"
"228103012-0-18539";"Your captain sent me. She said you needed some help?"
"228103012-0-18543";"Time? What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-18549";"Aren't you concerned what will happen to you?"
"228103012-0-18550";"I found them, but the burglar was already dead."
"228103012-0-18553";"I found some salted meat. I think it's been poisoned."
"228103012-0-18557";"What are you going to do with him?"
"228103012-0-18561";"Yes. I want to ask you about—"
"228103012-0-18563";"I found a letter from someone named Rilyn. Do you know him?"
"228103012-0-18564";"Doesn't look like the giant caused you any trouble."
"228103012-0-18565";"I've heard rumors about your stall."
"228103012-0-18569";"Terrible. What's going on?"
"228103012-0-18596";"Keep your voice down, battlereeve. Razum-dar sent me."
"228103012-0-18600";"I know where your food comes from."
"228103012-0-18601";"You know you're eating people."
"228103012-0-18602";"I found this inventory. Condalin and the Canonreeve were arguing about this earlier."
"228103012-0-18604";"The plot was real. We fought Astanya and her assassins, and won."
"228103012-0-18611";"Tell me the answer. Now."
"228103012-0-18612";"Tell me the answer, or I'll let Iroda know your scam."
"228103012-0-18613";"Tell me, or I'll see you clapped in irons."
"228103012-0-18614";"What's it going to cost me?"
"228103012-0-18616";"How much is this answer going to cost me?"
"228103012-0-18618";"How much will this impact my coinpurse?"
"228103012-0-18620";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-18625";"An officer's uniform. Looks like you were right."
"228103012-0-18627";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-18629";"Why were you bound here, spirit?"
"228103012-0-18632";"I'm a sworn agent of the queen! A very important person. No, a hero!"
"228103012-0-18634";"That's not what I've heard."
"228103012-0-18635";"You said Leel was your spiritual leader. What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-18641";"Can I ask you something?"
"228103012-0-18647";"On behalf of the Queen, I'm here to arrest you for treason!"
"228103012-0-18651";"I'm looking for a Redguard named Varnedo."
"228103012-0-18652";"Ow. I take it your plan worked?"
"228103012-0-18662";"I think there's been a mistake."
"228103012-0-18663";"What do you want me to do?"
"228103012-0-18664";"What can I do for you?"
"228103012-0-18668";"What about the rest of the villagers?"
"228103012-0-18669";"Who are you spying on?"
"228103012-0-18672";"Is someone trying to catch you?"
"228103012-0-18677";"I hear you were talking to a Redguard. Varnedo, maybe?"
"228103012-0-18678";"Erronfaire needs you back at the docks. Now."
"228103012-0-18680";"Captain Erronfaire sent me, she needs you back at the boat."
"228103012-0-18684";"Captain Erronfaire sent me to find you. She wants you back on the Wave Cutter."
"228103012-0-18685";"Why? Who are you going to fight?"
"228103012-0-18687";"Are you going to war?"
"228103012-0-18688";"Don't worry. I'll heal."
"228103012-0-18692";"Who are you? What's wrong?"
"228103012-0-18693";"What more can you tell me?"
"228103012-0-18699";"Malareth sent me."
"228103012-0-18721";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-18735";"What's the job?"
"228103012-0-18738";"I heard that <<1>> is purusing <<2>>"
"228103012-0-18744";"What happened to Degail?"
"228103012-0-18749";"Where can I find Degail?"
"228103012-0-18751";"Where can I find Degail?"
"228103012-0-18757";"No thanks. I'm just looking around."
"228103012-0-18763";"I've been looking for you. Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-18766";"The same voice spoke to me. I think the shrines are cleansed."
"228103012-0-18767";"On behalf of the Queen, I'm here to arrest you on counts of treason."
"228103012-0-18769";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-18771";"I heard <<1>> has a daughter who stays by herself during the day."
"228103012-0-18775";"I discovered <<1>> is struggling with money."
"228103012-0-18779";"So, uhhh, what should I do?"
"228103012-0-18785";"I'm interested to know more about <<1>>, do you know her well?"
"228103012-0-18789";"Let's get started."
"228103012-0-18792";"I have a couple of questions."
"228103012-0-18796";"I've got them."
"228103012-0-18800";"Got them. Pretty easy job, actually."
"228103012-0-18816";"Can you tell me about your battle with Sinmur?"
"228103012-0-18818";"Why is Wuuthrad so powerful?"
"228103012-0-18832";"Ready to get out of here?"
"228103012-0-18833";"Ready to join your friends and head back to the surface?"

"228103012-0-26777";"What makes you think Casnar is missing?"
"228103012-0-26779";"The missing persons case is solved. Can't we check if Casnar was a victim?"
"228103012-0-26782";"May I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-26784";"What's going on? Who are these people?"

"228103012-0-26830";"Sinien? How'd you get here?"
"228103012-0-26831";"Why the hostility?"
"228103012-0-26832";"Why are you opposed to the wedding?"
"228103012-0-26836";"What do you want from this forest, again?"
"228103012-0-26837";"Why doesn't the mead affect you?"
"228103012-0-26838";"I overheated the sap vats and completed the Trial of Body."
"228103012-0-26840";"What type of wolves are we dealing with here?"

"228103012-0-26864";"You're a new mage?"
"228103012-0-26865";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-26869";"Why are you so suspicious?"
"228103012-0-26870";"You seem cheerful."
"228103012-0-26873";"And if they're not?"
"228103012-0-26875";"Aren't you wounded? Why are you out here?"
"228103012-0-26876";"That staff was an illusion. Where's the real one?"
"228103012-0-26882";"What do I do?"
"228103012-0-26884";"Remind me what the warriors believe."
"228103012-0-26885";"Remind me what the warriors believe."

"228103012-0-26936";"What happened after the last time we spoke?"
"228103012-0-26938";"Felari sent me to help. She said you were attacked?"
"228103012-0-26939";"Tell me about Cropsford."

"228103012-0-26984";"I don't hear anything."
"228103012-0-26985";"The lieutenant isn't coming. You're both long dead."
"228103012-0-26986";"She didn't make it."
"228103012-0-26990";"She didn't make it."
"228103012-0-26991";"She didn't make it."

"228103012-0-27039";"General Thoron sent me to you."
"228103012-0-27045";"What do you do around here?"
"228103012-0-27047";"Killing all those people was necessary?"

"228103012-0-27067";"How can I help?"
"228103012-0-27068";"Why does he hate you?"
"228103012-0-27076";"What do you do when you're not resting?"
"228103012-0-27079";"Does it worry you, being on the outskirts of town?"
"228103012-0-27080";"The Khajiit I just defeated mentioned the same."
"228103012-0-27082";"<<1>> said there was a fire at your plantation."
"228103012-0-27085";"You're working hard."
"228103012-0-27091";"Hold on. Who or what is Selene?"
"228103012-0-27092";"You said you'd just returned to town. What were you doing?"
"228103012-0-27095";"Did any ships survive the hurricane?"
"228103012-0-27102";"I'll leave you to it."
"228103012-0-27107";"So this isn't your field?"
"228103012-0-27109";"Can we force our way through?"
"228103012-0-27111";"Draval didn't make it. What happened?"
"228103012-0-27115";"Did you just bind up my legs with vines?"
"228103012-0-27117";"Actually, I take issue with you. Casnar's just a good excuse to give you a few new scars."
"228103012-0-27118";"How can you be sure of that?"
"228103012-0-27120";"Tell me about Zenithar."
"228103012-0-27126";"Are you injured?"
"228103012-0-27127";"Where will you go now?"
"228103012-0-27129";"Your husband sent me to consecrate your remains."
"228103012-0-27145";"Possibly. What do you know about  <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-27149";"Someone I spoke to on my way into town mentioned you're having some kind of problem?"
"228103012-0-27151";"There has to be something. Just tell me."
"228103012-0-27157";"Who are these hostages they're holding?"
"228103012-0-27158";"Major Cirenwe wants us to split up the tasks."
"228103012-0-27164";"What do you suggest?"
"228103012-0-27167";"Where did they take her?"
"228103012-0-27168";"Wait. Aranias is supposed to demonstrate her power on a Bosmer?"
"228103012-0-27172";"He doesn't look well, my lady."
"228103012-0-27173";"Who were you speaking to when I came out?"
"228103012-0-27178";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"228103012-0-27179";"Have you seen these people before?"
"228103012-0-27181";"What's so special about this ruin?"
"228103012-0-27182";"How did you end up here?"
"228103012-0-27183";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-27184";"Halindor said he'd just returned from business?"
"228103012-0-27185";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-27189";"Is there anything else I need to know?"
"228103012-0-27196";"I'm alive, and you're going to live too. Make a run for the exit."
"228103012-0-27199";"What are the Dro-m'Athra?"
"228103012-0-27200";"The Stonefire Cult?"
"228103012-0-27201";"What happened to your husband?"
"228103012-0-27203";"How did you end up in the tower?"
"228103012-0-27208";"My Queen, you're hurt."
"228103012-0-27210";"Everyone made it here all right?"
"228103012-0-27215";"How did the Veiled Heritants get here so quickly?"
"228103012-0-27220";"Why are you dancing on the table?"
"228103012-0-27221";"What do you suggest?"
"228103012-0-27226";"I've been sent to tell you I don't need training."
"228103012-0-27227";"The city is a safe haven, a place where we can regroup and organize."
"228103012-0-27228";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-27229";"I'm still figuring it out myself. I was told that we'd use this area as a safe haven."
"228103012-0-27230";"I'm still figuring it out myself. I was told that we'd use this area as a safe haven."

"228103012-0-27233";"How do I find her remains?"
"228103012-0-27236";"What do you think about all this?"
"228103012-0-27237";"What's your plan?"
"228103012-0-27238";"What are you planning to do?"
"228103012-0-27243";"When did these people arrive?"
"228103012-0-27244";"You said you can't decide, but … what do you think should be done with her?"
"228103012-0-27245";"You'll be all right."
"228103012-0-27247";"What happened at Pell's Gate?"
"228103012-0-27255";"I'm ready, Bowenas."
"228103012-0-27256";"I'd like to learn more about them."
"228103012-0-27259";"Calm down. I'm no enemy. I'm here to rescue you."
"228103012-0-27269";"I'm an agent of the queen. I'm here to help you."
"228103012-0-27270";"Are you scared of your brother?"
"228103012-0-27274";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-27275";"You helped to contaminate the Johads, didn't you?"
"228103012-0-27278";"What are your thoughts on the current situation?"
"228103012-0-27279";"What are your thoughts on the current situation?"
"228103012-0-27280";"What are your thoughts on the current situation?"
"228103012-0-27282";"You should get out of here."
"228103012-0-27284";"Anything else I should know about this place?"
"228103012-0-27288";"Is this all that made it back?"
"228103012-0-27290";"Is this all that made it back?"
"228103012-0-27292";"Anything else I should know?"
"228103012-0-27296";"Why did you leave your pack?"
"228103012-0-27302";"I'm looking for the designs for this ship."
"228103012-0-27304";"I'm looking for the designs for this ship."
"228103012-0-27305";"I'm looking for the designs for this ship."

"228103012-0-27317";"I'm with the Dominion. I'm here to rescue you."
"228103012-0-27325";"Borgath didn't make it, but I set Sinfay and Vikord free."
"228103012-0-27337";"I thought we just needed to drive them back."
"228103012-0-27341";"Why raid this place?"
"228103012-0-27343";"Why isn't Klovag with you?"
"228103012-0-27344";"Where did everyone come from?"
"228103012-0-27345";"I found him, but he's not coming."
"228103012-0-27346";"Why was I summoned?"
"228103012-0-27347";"Why was I summoned?"
"228103012-0-27348";"Why was I summoned?"
"228103012-0-27350";"There was. I need to find some ritual components for Pircalmo."
"228103012-0-27351";"Your skin is a strange color. Are you ill?"
"228103012-0-27352";"Why do you like it here so much?"
"228103012-0-27356";"I only have two of the ships' designs."
"228103012-0-27357";"Yes. I have the ship designs right here."
"228103012-0-27358";"These woods are cursed."
"228103012-0-27359";"You will die here!"
"228103012-0-27360";"And now they've been raised?"
"228103012-0-27367";"I only have two of the ships' designs."
"228103012-0-27368";"I'm looking for some hoarvor chitin."
"228103012-0-27370";"I'm looking for the designs for this ship."
"228103012-0-27371";"Yes, it's all here. Now drink this and go."
"228103012-0-27377";"What happened to Arakh?"
"228103012-0-27378";"You need to stop spreading rumors about Sarolion."
"228103012-0-27380";"I spoke to her. She agreed to stop spreading rumors, and seemed actually to be sweet on you."
"228103012-0-27384";"You're Pircalmo? I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-27388";"What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-27390";"I recovered your sword."
"228103012-0-27395";"Do we really need to attack Molag Bal?"
"228103012-0-27396";"Is this our entire force?"
"228103012-0-27398";"Yes. I have the ship designs right here."
"228103012-0-27399";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-27400";"What makes these new warships so special?"
"228103012-0-27401";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-27402";"We need to get out of this place."
"228103012-0-27403";"Are you the artificer who arrived with the Mages Guild?"
"228103012-0-27404";"Just glad I could help. Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-27405";"Why are you building ships at Tava's Blessing?"
"228103012-0-27409";"Is it working? What's wrong?"
"228103012-0-27410";"What happened to Alasan?"
"228103012-0-27412";"I've got the cores. What was that all about?"
"228103012-0-27414";"Tell me about rams."
"228103012-0-27415";"It looks good."
"228103012-0-27417";"It's kind of ugly."
"228103012-0-27419";"Open."
"228103012-0-27420";"Open."
"228103012-0-27421";"Unlock."
"228103012-0-27422";"Open."
"228103012-0-27423";"Key."
"228103012-0-27424";"Open."
"228103012-0-27425";"You have to stop! Pircalmo didn't break your contract."
"228103012-0-27428";"Then the High Elves are worried about Akkhuz-ri's fall?"
"228103012-0-27429";"It's been a journey. How does the common Khajiit feel about this?"
"228103012-0-27430";"The Wood Elves aren't worried about the Mane's fall?"
"228103012-0-27432";"Are you following me?"
"228103012-0-27434";"You're just going to give up?"
"228103012-0-27456";"Where are they?"
"228103012-0-27457";"So Aranias will now become the ""Wilderqueen""?"
"228103012-0-27458";"I've done what I could."
"228103012-0-27459";"I've done what I could."
"228103012-0-27464";"What's left to be afraid of?"
"228103012-0-27466";"How do you intend to do that?"
"228103012-0-27467";"You can do this."
"228103012-0-27468";"Who is Mane Akkhuz-ri?"
"228103012-0-27470";"What happens now?"
"228103012-0-27471";"I decided I don't need battlefield training."
"228103012-0-27473";"Grand Warlord Zimmeron told me to report to you."
"228103012-0-27478";"General Dar-Liurz sent me over here."
"228103012-0-27484";"Do you have any suspects?"
"228103012-0-27485";"Tell me of the Mages Guild."
"228103012-0-27489";"Olvyia Indaram sent me for munitions."

"228103012-0-28156";"Why are you doing this again?"
"228103012-0-28157";"Want to come in this cave with me?"
"228103012-0-28158";"What was the plan again?"
"228103012-0-28179";"Why do you have to die?"
"228103012-0-28187";"Can I ask a few questions?"
"228103012-0-28188";"Why don't you just tell me what you're talking about?"
"228103012-0-28189";"I defeated the Thane and freed your souls."
"228103012-0-28190";"<Take disguise.>"
"228103012-0-28195";"What happened to him?"
"228103012-0-28196";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-28205";"What do we need to do to launch phase two?"
"228103012-0-28208";"<Examine the corpse.>"
"228103012-0-28212";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-28221";"The two-pronged attack is under way. What's the next step?"
"228103012-0-28224";"Why aren't you down there?"
"228103012-0-28225";"Pircalmo, what's going on up here?"
"228103012-0-28226";"What will you do with it?"
"228103012-0-28228";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-28229";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-28240";"She didn't survive the battle."
"228103012-0-28241";"Everything all right here?"
"228103012-0-28242";"Some of the Argonians planned to attack your soldiers."
"228103012-0-28245";"[Lie] Some of the hunters were sparring earlier. That's probably what your scouts heard."
"228103012-0-28246";"What is <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-28247";"Talk 09"
"228103012-0-28249";"Would you mind sparring with me? I'm looking to join the division championships."
"228103012-0-28250";"Can you open the way for us?"
"228103012-0-28252";"We're here to stop the Sea Vipers."
"228103012-0-28258";"Why so jumpy?"
"228103012-0-28261";"Did you serve a Wood Elf named Rollin last night?"
"228103012-0-28265";"This isn't much of an encampment."
"228103012-0-28266";"Have you spoken with Captain Rawan?"
"228103012-0-28267";"Where did you come from?"
"228103012-0-28268";"What else do you know about the third Ward?"
"228103012-0-28269";"You really think the Withered Hand is weakened?"
"228103012-0-28271";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-28276";"Worry me about what?"
"228103012-0-28279";"<<1>> went rogue because the army ignored his warning and pirates killed his family."
"228103012-0-28284";"What's next?"
"228103012-0-28285";"Duzal-ja sent me. I'm here to collect his order of meat pies?"
"228103012-0-28289";"Just as you asked."
"228103012-0-28291";"I'm looking for a necklace. A Wood Elf gave it to you?"
"228103012-0-28297";"Harpies? Hags? Anything else?"
"228103012-0-28298";"Hey, how did you know who I am?"
"228103012-0-28299";"Hey, how did you know who I am? Have we met?"
"228103012-0-28303";"Yes. Pelidil is dead."
"228103012-0-28305";"I'm passing through."
"228103012-0-28307";"What does that mean?"
"228103012-0-28313";"What do you think it is?"
"228103012-0-28314";"You must take it back."
"228103012-0-28315";"Indaenir is the Silvenar?"
"228103012-0-28316";"Yes, it's true."
"228103012-0-28321";"Who are all these people?"
"228103012-0-28322";"Can you explain a bit more about this plan?"
"228103012-0-28326";"Yes, Naemon is finally at rest."
"228103012-0-28329";"Is Maritus Blasio a relative of yours?"
"228103012-0-28334";"Was Divyth Dorayn a relative of yours?"
"228103012-0-28335";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"228103012-0-28336";"The King said you might be willing to aid us."
"228103012-0-28342";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-28345";"Which of us should stay behind?"
"228103012-0-28346";"Have you noticed anything unusual?"
"228103012-0-28349";"Not why I'm here. Was Enide Geta related to you?"
"228103012-0-28356";"Do you know Varana Scaeva?"
"228103012-0-28357";"Glad I could help. Can I take the urn now?"
"228103012-0-28358";"How do you know it was the water?"
"228103012-0-28367";"How did your tribe end up in <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-28369";"What is your role in this tribe?"
"228103012-0-28370";"Who are you looking for?"
"228103012-0-28376";"Do you have spare warriors I can take?"
"228103012-0-28378";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-28379";"It's blank."
"228103012-0-28384";"Isn't harming plant life a violation of the Pact?"
"228103012-0-28385";"Alanya is safe. I've convinced Ranneth not to kill her."
"228103012-0-28386";"How did you get injured?"
"228103012-0-28387";"Why would Shiri visit her cousin in Satakalaam?"
"228103012-0-28389";"How did you get injured?"
"228103012-0-28390";"Why would Shiri visit her cousin in Satakalaam?"
"228103012-0-28391";"What would you suggest?"
"228103012-0-28394";"Why do you need someone with experience?"
"228103012-0-28395";"How did that happen?"
"228103012-0-28399";"What do you mean, sort out the Mane?"
"228103012-0-28405";"Can you brief me on the situation here?"
"228103012-0-28406";"What would you suggest?"
"228103012-0-28407";"What would you suggest?"
"228103012-0-28408";"What would you suggest?"
"228103012-0-28411";"What do you think Shiri is planning?"
"228103012-0-28412";"Why isn't this break in the wall guarded?"
"228103012-0-28416";"What can you tell me about the competition?"
"228103012-0-28426";"I'm ready to compete in the Summoner Division Championship."
"228103012-0-28429";"What can you tell me about Hectahame?"
"228103012-0-28433";"Was that it?"
"228103012-0-28434";"Was that it?"
"228103012-0-28435";"Are you following me?"
"228103012-0-28440";"I'm ready to compete in the Swordmaster Division Championships."
"228103012-0-28443";"Yes, I'd like to compete."
"228103012-0-28448";"What's happening in Cheydinhal?"
"228103012-0-28453";"Gilraen said you were a healer."
"228103012-0-28457";"What can you tell me about the relics?"
"228103012-0-28465";"The engine has been destroyed."
"228103012-0-28469";"What will you do once Tertius finds your son?"
"228103012-0-28472";"What is the fighting all about?"
"228103012-0-28473";"I could use your help."
"228103012-0-28475";"What does Marcellus want?"
"228103012-0-28476";"Tell me about the Canonreeve."
"228103012-0-28479";"Is this all fun and games to you?"
"228103012-0-28482";"Come with me. I could use you."
"228103012-0-28485";"What's happening here?"
"228103012-0-28489";"Yes and no."
"228103012-0-28493";"What's happening in Cheydinhal?"
"228103012-0-28494";"What is the Canonreeve doing in the Hollow?"
"228103012-0-28495";"I need to get into the pyramid."
"228103012-0-28497";"What will happen to the Centurion?"
"228103012-0-28498";"Throne Keeper Farvad, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-28499";"I could use some help."
"228103012-0-28501";"So you sent a pregnant woman off on her own?"
"228103012-0-28502";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-28506";"I'm here to challenge <<1>> to an honor fight."
"228103012-0-28507";"Tell me about Belya."
"228103012-0-28512";"What can you tell me about the Shadowed Path?"
"228103012-0-28513";"What's in this special drink?"
"228103012-0-28521";"Hello? Are you <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-28522";"What about those cultists in the temple district?"
"228103012-0-28523";"Why do you need to keep the Arenthians out of there?"
"228103012-0-28525";"Who or what are you hiding from?"
"228103012-0-28527";"Why are you fighting?"
"228103012-0-28529";"Tell me about yourself, Sir Cadwell."
"228103012-0-28532";"You're sure these altars are necromantic?"
"228103012-0-28533";"You want me to enter the Labyrinth on my own?"
"228103012-0-28534";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-28537";"Is it finished, then?"
"228103012-0-28540";"What just happened?"
"228103012-0-28545";"Why are you fighting?"
"228103012-0-28547";"The honor was all mine, Talia."
"228103012-0-28548";"The honor was all mine, Talia."
"228103012-0-28549";"Have you figured out what these altars are?"
"228103012-0-28550";"Where did you hear this rumor?"
"228103012-0-28551";"So just walk into a haunted town full of angry cursed army? Really?"
"228103012-0-28553";"What's the problem?"
"228103012-0-28559";"Was anyone else with Prince Azah?"
"228103012-0-28560";"How did you learn about Shiri?"
"228103012-0-28561";"Why did Shiri come here?"
"228103012-0-28562";"Was anyone else with you and the prince?"
"228103012-0-28565";"How did you learn about Shiri?"
"228103012-0-28566";"You've been hunting Fadalia?"
"228103012-0-28567";"What's wrong with the other merchants' goods?"
"228103012-0-28569";"How did that happen?"
"228103012-0-28570";"How did that happen?"
"228103012-0-28571";"I've lost my repair kit."
"228103012-0-28575";"Having a dispute with the local brewer?"
"228103012-0-28577";"Throne Keeper Farvad, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-28578";"Throne Keeper Farvad, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-28579";"Why don't you leave?"
"228103012-0-28581";"You want to leave Cheydinhal?"
"228103012-0-28583";"What's next? You mentioned an Oblivion gate."
"228103012-0-28584";"What dark deed? What is Shiri planning?"
"228103012-0-28587";"How does Tu'whacca think you can help me?"
"228103012-0-28589";"You're the prince. You really want to take this risk?"
"228103012-0-28591";"You think you're well-suited for this fight?"
"228103012-0-28600";"I've practiced as much as I need to."
"228103012-0-28602";"The Queen said something about Molag Bal?"
"228103012-0-28603";"What dark deed? What is Shiri planning?"
"228103012-0-28604";"What dark deed? What is Shiri planning?"
"228103012-0-28606";"Can you tell me about your mission boards?"
"228103012-0-28609";"Can you tell me about your mission boards?"
"228103012-0-28612";"So, now you're the Valkynaz of the Citadel?"
"228103012-0-28617";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"228103012-0-28619";"Why are you called <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-28620";"What is your role in this tribe?"
"228103012-0-28621";"Thank you for your help,  Countess."
"228103012-0-28624";"Can I ask you some questions?"
"228103012-0-28625";"Congratulations are in order."
"228103012-0-28630";"What is your role in this tribe?"
"228103012-0-28633";"Forgive me. I didn't mean to offend someone of your stature."
"228103012-0-28640";"I'm ready to duel."
"228103012-0-28641";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-28644";"Why do the Orcs stand in your way?"
"228103012-0-28652";"I deactivated the wards. What's next?"
"228103012-0-28653";"Why aren't you outside fighting?"
"228103012-0-28658";"I have other questions."
"228103012-0-28663";"Very well. I'll feed an elder spider."
"228103012-0-28664";"I'll have <<1>> feed your children."
"228103012-0-28666";"I was able to help before."
"228103012-0-28669";"What should we do?"
"228103012-0-28680";"Do you have anything that could help my lizard?"
"228103012-0-28681";"Where else can I find racing lizards?"
"228103012-0-28683";"I'm looking for a racing lizard."
"228103012-0-28684";"Why would the villagers turn to the Nereids?"
"228103012-0-28685";"So Malgoth observed the Meat Mandate?"
"228103012-0-28686";"The Right of Theft can even compel the dead?"
"228103012-0-28688";"I'm looking for a racing lizard."
"228103012-0-28695";"Have you seen an Altmer woman pass this way?"
"228103012-0-28701";"What is a Shadowscale?"
"228103012-0-28703";"How can <<1>> help me find <<2>>'s hunters?"
"228103012-0-28706";"You've been hiding a harpy on your balcony?"
"228103012-0-28707";"You've been hiding a harpy on your balcony?"
"228103012-0-28709";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-28710";"Why didn't I win?"
"228103012-0-28711";"Can I try the race again?"
"228103012-0-28713";"Who is General Malgoth?"
"228103012-0-28717";"Where is she again?"
"228103012-0-28726";"How do I track the Senche?"
"228103012-0-28727";"You have a lute."
"228103012-0-28729";"The Senche killed your dog?"
"228103012-0-28732";"How did the other Altmer react when you asked a Wood Elf to marry you?"
"228103012-0-28734";"Yes. What do these shrines do?"
"228103012-0-28735";"I've done what you asked."
"228103012-0-28736";"Tell me more about the Falinesti Faithful."
"228103012-0-28740";"Did you really think you could walk into a camp of Wood Orcs?"
"228103012-0-28742";"Egannor sent me. I'm here to free you."
"228103012-0-28745";"Egannor sent me. I'll get you out."
"228103012-0-28749";"What's your plan?"
"228103012-0-28750";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-28754";"I'm not helping you in blind vengeance. You're on your own."
"228103012-0-28755";"All right. I'll help you get vengeance on these Orcs."
"228103012-0-28758";"While I'm busy taking heads, what will you be doing?"
"228103012-0-28762";"I have your heads."
"228103012-0-28765";"I have not seen a forest spirit."
"228103012-0-28770";"I'm curious. How do you control the land?"
"228103012-0-28772";"Another hurricane? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-28773";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-28774";"But you said there is some way I can help?"
"228103012-0-28785";"Tell me more about Vanus Galerion."
"228103012-0-28786";"There's a body behind that wall."
"228103012-0-28790";"Why aren't you welcome in Bruma?"
"228103012-0-28799";"What's going on in here?"
"228103012-0-28802";"Thragof said one of you is a traitor. What do you have to say for yourself?"
"228103012-0-28803";"Do we know where to go from here?"
"228103012-0-28805";"Are the priests returning to Tu'whacca's throne?"
"228103012-0-28806";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-28807";"Does that mean you know how to open the gate?"
"228103012-0-28808";"Do you know how to open the gate?"
"228103012-0-28809";"What was your wish?"
"228103012-0-28810";"What's happening here?"
"228103012-0-28812";"Did you find something?"
"228103012-0-28813";"<<1>> told me you found an artifact."
"228103012-0-28814";"What did you find?"
"228103012-0-28817";"I don't think she was expecting guests."
"228103012-0-28819";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-28823";"How are you doing, Khali?"
"228103012-0-28824";"Don't worry, Erinel. Laurosse sent me to rescue you."
"228103012-0-28832";"It would help if your forest spirits weren't attacking me."
"228103012-0-28833";"<<1>> is guarding our retreat. The way should be clear."
"228103012-0-28835";"What are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-28837";"How have you survived in this place?"
"228103012-0-28838";"Do you know the Groundskeeper?"
"228103012-0-28839";"So you're the cook?"
"228103012-0-28840";"Did you come through when Vanus opened the portal?"
"228103012-0-28841";"Are these facilities adequate for your needs?"
"228103012-0-28842";"Anything new going on?"
"228103012-0-28843";"Why aren't we affected by the blight?"
"228103012-0-28844";"What is Bruma like?"
"228103012-0-28845";"Do we really need a bank when the world is coming to an end?"
"228103012-0-28846";"Do you think the Fighters Guild is prepared for this mission?"
"228103012-0-28847";"How are you doing for supplies?"
"228103012-0-28848";"Any word from the missing fighters?"
"228103012-0-28849";"Have you had any word from the missing mages?"
"228103012-0-28850";"What's the role of the Mages Guild in all this?"
"228103012-0-28851";"Does the Mages Guild know anything about this city?"
"228103012-0-28855";"What will happen to all the feral Bosmer here?"
"228103012-0-28856";"It's your fault those Mages died."

"228103012-0-32291";"Is this hamlet your home?"
"228103012-0-32295";"Why do you ask?"
"228103012-0-32297";"Yes. I do. What will this ritual do exactly?"
"228103012-0-32302";"Hey, anything interesting going on?"
"228103012-0-32304";"So is that guy over there <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-32306";"You're the one called the Sentinel?"
"228103012-0-32308";"Here's your amulet back."
"228103012-0-32310";"It's probably best if you stay here and rest."
"228103012-0-32311";"The Sentinel sent me to get a bud from your branches."
"228103012-0-32317";"If you help me now, I'm sure the Sentinel will allow you to grow normally again."
"228103012-0-32318";"I've done what you asked."
"228103012-0-32320";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-32322";"It's not good news."
"228103012-0-32325";"What can you tell me about Armando?"
"228103012-0-32326";"I'm looking for a minstrel named Sorion. Have you seen him?"
"228103012-0-32331";"Can we lower the drawbridge?"
"228103012-0-32333";"What more can we do?"
"228103012-0-32336";"Yes. I have the pure heartwood."
"228103012-0-32341";"You should go over and talk to that woman. She keeps looking at you."
"228103012-0-32344";"I found this sword near where one of the missing Orc's was last seen."
"228103012-0-32345";"Let's stop <<1>>."
"228103012-0-32346";"I'm ready if you are."
"228103012-0-32349";"We shouldn't confront Renchant first?"
"228103012-0-32350";"How can I free you?"
"228103012-0-32361";"And how do we do that?"
"228103012-0-32366";"Who was Anconath?"
"228103012-0-32367";"Verandis wants the troops to stay here and guard our flank."
"228103012-0-32368";"Verandis has ordered the troops to remain here and guard our flank."
"228103012-0-32369";"No. I heard he died suddenly. What happened?"
"228103012-0-32371";"What will you do?"
"228103012-0-32374";"Why did you call your ship the Albatross?"
"228103012-0-32375";"What else do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-32389";"We met in the tower. You were struck by lightning."
"228103012-0-32394";"I'm here to help. Captain Gaercroft sent me."
"228103012-0-32397";"How did the situation get so desperate?"
"228103012-0-32399";"Have the Imperials taken your supplies as well?"
"228103012-0-32406";"Did you make this amulet?"
"228103012-0-32407";"The guild?"
"228103012-0-32408";"What's happening in North Glen?"
"228103012-0-32409";"Actually he wants to trade the poultices for your bows."
"228103012-0-32418";"What spurred you to found this school?"
"228103012-0-32419";"Why didn't you tell me this before?"
"228103012-0-32421";"I'm just glad it worked out so well."
"228103012-0-32423";"What about the Baandari?"
"228103012-0-32425";"I'm here to help. Captain Gaercroft sent me."
"228103012-0-32427";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-32428";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-32429";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-32430";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-32431";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-32433";"Why did Leonce throw you out of the inn?"
"228103012-0-32434";"I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-32437";"I'm looking for a scout named Isabeth."
"228103012-0-32440";"What's wrong with Laetille?"
"228103012-0-32443";"People are killing each other in the streets."
"228103012-0-32446";"I'm looking for some Dominion scouts. Have you seen them?"
"228103012-0-32449";"Can you send me back down to the caldera?"
"228103012-0-32456";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-32457";"I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-32461";"Whose arrival?"
"228103012-0-32462";"I'm looking for some Dominion scouts."
"228103012-0-32470";"Actually, she's just concerned with healing her wounded."
"228103012-0-32471";"[Lie] It is as he says. The thief bumped into us as he fled. I chased after him."
"228103012-0-32474";"I'm ready to go right now."
"228103012-0-32479";"I'm looking for a group of scouts."
"228103012-0-32484";"Where did this blessing come from?"
"228103012-0-32486";"What did you do to Laetille?"
"228103012-0-32489";"Do you really believe there is no cure?"
"228103012-0-32498";"Jode's Chariot?"
"228103012-0-32502";"[Lie] I saw the thief. He ran off as though the blades of Mephala were at his back."
"228103012-0-32504";"A voice told me that the prince was blessed by Arkay."
"228103012-0-32509";"I didn't see anything."
"228103012-0-32525";"<<1>> was the cause of all of this."
"228103012-0-32526";"A mockery? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-32531";"<Release bonds> You're free to go. Peras is waiting outside."
"228103012-0-32542";"Did I miss anything while I was traveling?"
"228103012-0-32543";"Were we the only ones to escape?"
"228103012-0-32546";"How did you know Aulus?"
"228103012-0-32549";"Did you really steal the moon-sugar?"
"228103012-0-32560";"The chasm?"
"228103012-0-32562";"Yes, he did. We need to return to his camp."
"228103012-0-32565";"I'll keep that in mind."
"228103012-0-32566";"Yes, I was."
"228103012-0-32577";"<<1>> gave me this <<2>>."
"228103012-0-32581";"Yes. Silver-Paws sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-32584";"What happened to start this?"
"228103012-0-32588";"<Release bonds> You're free to go. Peras is waiting outside."
"228103012-0-32590";"I've heard that you help the less fortunate."
"228103012-0-32593";"Why are you so anxious to help resolve the situation in Shornhelm?"
"228103012-0-32598";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-32602";"He's only concerned for his daughter."
"228103012-0-32614";"Any idea where Reezal-Jul disappeared to?"
"228103012-0-32615";"I need another disguise."
"228103012-0-32619";"Why are you doing this?"
"228103012-0-32624";"The traitors have been dealt with. But Montclair is gone. He left General Reezal-Jul in charge."
"228103012-0-32625";"Who do I give these to?"
"228103012-0-32630";"What?"
"228103012-0-32637";"Why do you call this place the Run Inn?"
"228103012-0-32638";"Where will you take the survivors?"
"228103012-0-32640";"What needs to be done with the bud?"
"228103012-0-32641";"I'll take care of Garron."
"228103012-0-32647";"What do you need?"
"228103012-0-32650";"Where will the parley take place?"
"228103012-0-32651";"You really think the Imperials want peace?"
"228103012-0-32652";"Why hire the guilds when you have guards?"
"228103012-0-32653";"What are you unhappy about?"
"228103012-0-32666";"I have the rutter right here. <Show the rutter>"
"228103012-0-32673";"I'm with you. What do we do next?"
"228103012-0-32674";"Why not buy some?"
"228103012-0-32681";"What happens if we fail?"
"228103012-0-32687";"Yes, I have it."
"228103012-0-32694";"What do you need?"
"228103012-0-32698";"Yes, it's true."
"228103012-0-32702";"Tell me your story, first."
"228103012-0-32707";"What is the Golden Claw?"
"228103012-0-32710";"What more is needed?"
"228103012-0-32714";"Yes, it's true."
"228103012-0-32719";"Excuse me. I would like to speak with you."
"228103012-0-32720";"Who's Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-32723";"How have you been by the way?"
"228103012-0-32730";"You must be Cadwell."
"228103012-0-32746";"Can you tell me more about this concoction you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-32747";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-32751";"What have you learned so far?"
"228103012-0-32752";"What's wrong with him?"
"228103012-0-32756";"Are you … sane?"
"228103012-0-32760";"What else should I know about Puddles?"
"228103012-0-32761";"I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-32765";"Are you sure you want to go through with this, Wylon?"
"228103012-0-32767";"I can sense the power of the relic. It doesn't feel particularly benign to me."
"228103012-0-32780";"I'm curious about the wyrd."
"228103012-0-32784";"I have some questions for you."
"228103012-0-32788";"You're holding up, then?"
"228103012-0-32791";"I'm curious about the wyrd."
"228103012-0-32800";"Can you tell me more about Marien's necklace?"
"228103012-0-32802";"I'll meet you there."
"228103012-0-32807";"Do we really need to keep searching?"
"228103012-0-32808";"You suggested I could help with something?"
"228103012-0-32809";"What do you mean? Where are you going?"
"228103012-0-32823";"If this is a blessing from Arkay, shouldn't a priest of Arkay recognize it?"
"228103012-0-32825";"I certainly don't."
"228103012-0-32833";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-32837";"Is there another way in?"
"228103012-0-32838";"Where is the rest of your team?"
"228103012-0-32841";"How go the repairs?"
"228103012-0-32842";"Have any Imperials been sighted outside the walls?"
"228103012-0-32843";"What have you done to the prince?"
"228103012-0-32848";"I have a few more questions."
"228103012-0-32852";"What's happened at Pelin Graveyard?"
"228103012-0-32855";"What does the book say?"
"228103012-0-32863";"What brings you to Bangkorai Garrison?"
"228103012-0-32864";"Tell me about the Mages Guild."
"228103012-0-32865";"It's a book. Can you tell me anything about it?"
"228103012-0-32867";"Do you know what it was after?"
"228103012-0-32869";"I'm finished."
"228103012-0-32870";"Aryette, I am a vampire."
"228103012-0-32877";"<<1>> sent me to meet with you."
"228103012-0-32882";"You realize this wasn't your fault?"
"228103012-0-32885";"Are the Imperials defeated then?"
"228103012-0-32887";"I haven't seen them."
"228103012-0-32889";"I have <<1>>."
"228103012-0-32894";"Did you find <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-32896";"<<1>> is dead."
"228103012-0-32898";"Can you tell me anything about Dame Marcelle?"
"228103012-0-32904";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-32913";"What's the situation, Raz?"
"228103012-0-32914";"A writer I know wants to meet a vampire. Are you interested?"
"228103012-0-32921";"Why are you tending to these Imperials?"
"228103012-0-32928";"<Keep Reading>"
"228103012-0-32933";"I have a few questions before I go."
"228103012-0-32934";"What are these Sentinels?"
"228103012-0-32935";"A friend of mine wants to meet a vampire. Interested?"
"228103012-0-32938";"There's a writer who wants to meet a vampire. Interested?"
"228103012-0-32942";"Can you tell me anything about Dame Marcelle?"
"228103012-0-32946";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-32947";"Did she see how to destroy them?"
"228103012-0-32949";"What are you doing back here?"
"228103012-0-32969";"<Examine the Soul Gem>"
"228103012-0-32971";"The decision is mine?"
"228103012-0-32978";"Did Moira's Hope's survivors make it to Hoarfrost?"
"228103012-0-32982";"I gathered that from your note—I mean, what do you need?"
"228103012-0-32989";"Who is Duraeg of the Dark Witnesses?"
"228103012-0-32998";"At least you made it this far."
"228103012-0-33000";"And how's the talk going so far?"
"228103012-0-33001";"Are you ready?"
"228103012-0-33004";"How's it going so far?"
"228103012-0-33005";"How's it going so far?"
"228103012-0-33006";"How's it going so far?"
"228103012-0-33015";"What brought the wyrd to these ruins?"
"228103012-0-33016";"Are you the wyress she rescued?"
"228103012-0-33017";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-33018";"How's it going so far?"
"228103012-0-33019";"How's it going so far?"
"228103012-0-33032";"Can you tell me about House Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-33033";"Are you sure you're ready for this?"
"228103012-0-33034";"We need to work together."
"228103012-0-33036";"Can you remember anything?"
"228103012-0-33038";"Let's go."
"228103012-0-33039";"Open the portal."
"228103012-0-33040";"Will you align with Captain Gaercroft?"
"228103012-0-33041";"You don't appreciate the bailiff's advances?"
"228103012-0-33042";"I'm looking for information about <<1>>."
"228103012-0-33045";"Do you know <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-33046";"I'm looking for information about <<1>>."
"228103012-0-33047";"That depends on what you're proposing."
"228103012-0-33049";"Hey, anything interesting going on?"
"228103012-0-33051";"Hey, anything interesting going on?"
"228103012-0-33053";"You want to help me distract him?"
"228103012-0-33055";"So is that guy over there <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-33061";"What can you tell me about Armando?"
"228103012-0-33062";"I just saw the barmaid looking in your direction."
"228103012-0-33064";"You should go over and talk to that woman. She keeps looking at you."
"228103012-0-33065";"What are the markers?"
"228103012-0-33067";"What does this rune do?"
"228103012-0-33068";"Why do you need me to do this?"
"228103012-0-33070";"What was he doing to you?"
"228103012-0-33074";"I'm not badly injured, though."
"228103012-0-33075";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-33078";"It was Isabeth's choice. And you need this alliance."
"228103012-0-33081";"Why leave your gates open when bandits attack?"
"228103012-0-33083";"<Follow the dog.>"
"228103012-0-33086";"Verandis needs your troops to stay behind."
"228103012-0-33087";"Verandis needs your troops to stay behind."
"228103012-0-33088";"Perhaps I can help?"
"228103012-0-33091";"Verandis wants your troops to stay behind to guard us here."
"228103012-0-33092";"Verandis wants your troops to stay behind to guard us here."
"228103012-0-33103";"You don't think the Baandari deserve anything in return for their help?"
"228103012-0-33108";"Sounds like a grim job."
"228103012-0-33112";"What happened at Flyleaf Catacombs?"
"228103012-0-33120";"I have a few questions."
"228103012-0-33122";"I'm ready to give you my recommendation."
"228103012-0-33130";"A skyshard?"
"228103012-0-33131";"But you do it anyway?"
"228103012-0-33139";"I have some questions for you."
"228103012-0-33145";"Why do you try to stop us, spirit?"
"228103012-0-33146";"You think the High King should crown you as King of Shornhelm?"
"228103012-0-33149";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-33150";"Who are you?"

"228103012-0-33156";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-33157";"Yes. Knight Commander Cheryline said this would be the worst of it."
"228103012-0-33161";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-33162";"Maybe he's just deep in prayer."
"228103012-0-33163";"You don't look much like a knight."
"228103012-0-33168";"I'm all right now. What happened to the Imperials?"
"228103012-0-33172";"What are these ruins?"
"228103012-0-33173";"I do have some questions."
"228103012-0-33174";"This power. Something about it feels wrong to me."
"228103012-0-33176";"Tamrith and Dorell won't wait. They want to see this through to the end."
"228103012-0-33182";"Why did Tharn try to help you?"
"228103012-0-33184";"The Houses refuse to wait this time."
"228103012-0-33185";"The Houses refuse to wait this time."
"228103012-0-33188";"How did it get so bad here?"
"228103012-0-33192";"What's wrong?"
"228103012-0-33200";"I'm here to talk about Teeba-Ja."
"228103012-0-33201";"<Hand him the <<1>>.>"
"228103012-0-33203";"The Vinedusk Rangers told me to speak with you."
"228103012-0-33217";"Tell me more about Almalexia."

"228103012-0-43754";"Have you seen a young Nord woman? Wears a flower in her hair?"
"228103012-0-43755";"She's a friend who's gone missing. I'm trying to find her."
"228103012-0-43762";"Have you seen a young Nord woman? Wears a flower in her hair?"
"228103012-0-43763";"Have you seen a young Nord woman? Wears a flower in her hair?"
"228103012-0-43764";"That's all I had to do to prove myself?"
"228103012-0-43771";"A woman saw Hildegard speaking with Chanter Nemus before she fled in tears."
"228103012-0-43775";"Yes, I saw your notice. What is it about?"
"228103012-0-43779";"I'm looking for a young Nord woman. Wears a flower in her hair."
"228103012-0-43783";"What was that about the Silver Dawn?"
"228103012-0-43786";"The Count told me that the Black Dragon is the First Sword of the Order of the Hour."
"228103012-0-43793";"We're ready to go now."
"228103012-0-43795";"We're ready to go back to Anvil now."
"228103012-0-43798";"Do you have one of the Primate's seals?"
"228103012-0-43799";"[Lie] What do you mean? Can't you tell I'm a servant?"
"228103012-0-43801";"Why didn't you return to the Sanctuary, Hildegard?"
"228103012-0-43804";"You abandoned us when we needed you the most. It was foolish and dangerous."
"228103012-0-43806";"We're a family, Hilde. We protect each other. We're stronger together."
"228103012-0-43808";"Deadhollow Halls sounds a little ominous. What can you tell me before we go?"
"228103012-0-43810";"You need to make sure Hildegard gets to the Sanctuary safely."
"228103012-0-43811";"The Hideaway isn't real descriptive. What can you tell me about it?"
"228103012-0-43812";"Underground Sepulcher. This isn't a tomb robbery, is it?"
"228103012-0-43813";"Glittering Grotto doesn't sound so bad. Nice even."
"228103012-0-43814";"I'm really supposed to go rob a sewer?"
"228103012-0-43816";"What should we do?"
"228103012-0-43817";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-43818";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-43830";"How do we get there?"
"228103012-0-43832";"How do we get in it?"
"228103012-0-43833";"What do we do after we get to Blackwood?"
"228103012-0-43834";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-43835";"What do you think this all means?"
"228103012-0-43836";"I saw. But who's Primate Jonas?"
"228103012-0-43837";"What is this place exactly?"
"228103012-0-43840";"What's your story?"
"228103012-0-43846";"Who would know <<1>>'s whereabouts?"
"228103012-0-43847";"We're in disguise. Why can't we walk through the front door?"
"228103012-0-43855";"Where is this amazing entrance you've uncovered?"
"228103012-0-43860";"Do you know what we'll be up against in there?"
"228103012-0-43877";"Can I help you with something?"
"228103012-0-43886";"Primate Artorius is dead."
"228103012-0-43888";"I want to know who Exulus the Wispmother is and why you posted this bounty."
"228103012-0-43891";"Can you tell me anything that will help me defeat Exulus?"
"228103012-0-43892";"We found a page from his journal. It had the pass-phrase for the crypt's guardian."
"228103012-0-43893";"What do you think about all of this?"
"228103012-0-43895";"What do you know about the dowry heist?"
"228103012-0-43897";"Why does the Iron Wheel think we stole the dowry?"
"228103012-0-43899";"Velsa said you could help me score heists."
"228103012-0-43900";"Why would <<1>> marry <<2>>?"
"228103012-0-43904";"I'd like to talk to you about the bounty you posted."

"228103012-0-43911";"I'm here about the bounty you posted."
"228103012-0-43914";"Tell me more about these disturbances."
"228103012-0-43915";"Where can I find the relics mentioned in your bounty?"
"228103012-0-43916";"<Remain silent.>"
"228103012-0-43924";"I have business inside the castle."
"228103012-0-43927";"I am?"
"228103012-0-43931";"I want to face your best gladiator in the arena."
"228103012-0-43935";"Your name sounds familiar. Any relation to Fortunata ap Dugal?"
"228103012-0-43939";"Contract's complete. I have a new one. I need to kill the Governor."
"228103012-0-43943";"Commander Scipio is dead and Count Carolus has been informed."
"228103012-0-43947";"How did you learn the Iron Wheel plans to depart?"
"228103012-0-43953";"Who is Mighty Chudan?"
"228103012-0-43958";"Was you getting beaten up part of the plan?"
"228103012-0-43970";"<<1>> sends her regards. [<<2>> dies]"
"228103012-0-43971";"It's time I decided what to do with you."
"228103012-0-43975";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-43978";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-43983";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-43985";"Are you okay?"

"228103012-0-43991";"What are we walking into exactly?"
"228103012-0-43992";"Why are you surprised I took the job?"
"228103012-0-43997";"Is this the biggest job you've ever pulled off?"
"228103012-0-43999";"You said you were from the Thieves Guild. What is that?"
"228103012-0-44000";"All right. Take us to Abah's Landing."
"228103012-0-44001";"Where is <<Ac:1>>?"
"228103012-0-44002";"I want to talk about what happened in <<1>>."
"228103012-0-44003";"I had some questions about the Thieves Guild."
"228103012-0-44019";"Why does <<1>> want my help?"
"228103012-0-44020";"What makes <<1>> think there was a traitor?"

"228103012-0-44034";"What are you holding?"
"228103012-0-44036";"Why won't a servant's disguise work inside the Iron Wheel headquarters?"
"228103012-0-44037";"Couldn't you make me an Iron Wheel uniform?"
"228103012-0-44041";"After what I learned at Iron Wheel Headquarters, I have questions."
"228103012-0-44045";"I want to talk about our trip to recover <<1>>."
"228103012-0-44048";"What do you know about the dowry heist?"
"228103012-0-44050";"Why does the Iron Wheel think we stole the dowry?"
"228103012-0-44052";"Are you safe here? Isn't the Iron Wheel after you?"
"228103012-0-44054";"Welcome back. Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-44056";"You must notice a lot from this vantage point."
"228103012-0-44057";"How can you be certain?"
"228103012-0-44059";"Where is your former Sanctuary, exactly?"
"228103012-0-44069";"Before we proceed, I have some questions."
"228103012-0-44073";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-44076";"Why is <<1>> your least favorite person?"
"228103012-0-44081";"Excuse me?"
"228103012-0-44085";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-44086";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-44087";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-44088";"Is the Thieves Guild everything you thought it would be?"
"228103012-0-44093";"I had some questions about <<c:1>>."
"228103012-0-44099";"How did you manage to remove the dye from your clothes?"
"228103012-0-44100";"An interesting collection of thieves you've put together here."
"228103012-0-44101";"When were you inside <<c:1>>?"
"228103012-0-44105";"You seem comfortable in your role in the Thieves Guild."

"228103012-0-44123";"How does <<1>> gain from this wedding?"
"228103012-0-44126";"Before we left for <<c:1>>, <<2>> said you had been inside. Did you ever walk Malooc's Path?"
"228103012-0-44128";"You said you were a danger to your wolf clan. Can you tell me about that?"
"228103012-0-44133";"What can we do about <<1>>?"
"228103012-0-44135";"What does <<1>> want?"
"228103012-0-44136";"How did your findings at Bthanual turn out?"
"228103012-0-44137";"Have you made any progress with that memory orb from Mzulft yet?"
"228103012-0-44138";"Glad to see you made it back from Coldharbour."
"228103012-0-44139";"I thought you and Kireth would've stayed in Wrothgar for awhile."
"228103012-0-44140";"Did exploring Bthanual help advance your career?"
"228103012-0-44141";"What happened with the memory orb we found in Mzulft?"

"228103012-0-44152";"So what have you been up to since we stopped the Maulborn plague?"
"228103012-0-44153";"Do you still have that dress you wore at Fort Amol?"

"228103012-0-44159";"It's good to see you again, my friend!"
"228103012-0-44165";"I'm not here because of the ritual."
"228103012-0-44169";"I'm ready now. Take me back to the heist."
"228103012-0-44177";"Before I go, can you remind me about a few things?"
"228103012-0-44178";"What's the Brotherhood's reputation like these days?"
"228103012-0-44179";"Ready as I'll ever be."
"228103012-0-44189";"I can read the Litany of Blood."
"228103012-0-44193";"What if I kill the wrong person?"
"228103012-0-44194";"Why didn't the Listener just tell me who to assassinate?"
"228103012-0-44197";"These pedestals used to be empty, right?"
"228103012-0-44206";"Why would you think I'm here to kill you?"
"228103012-0-44209";"Are your cakes really that popular?"
"228103012-0-44213";"I have a cake voucher."
"228103012-0-44226";"Why does Elam want you to wait here?"
"228103012-0-44228";"I thought you were running around with Astara?"
"228103012-0-44229";"Is everything amusing to you?"
"228103012-0-44241";"How do I reach the Governor's private pantry?"
"228103012-0-44243";"Is poison really the best option for this kill?"
"228103012-0-44245";"I need to speak with you about the dockmaster."
"228103012-0-44249";"Aren't you coming?"
"228103012-0-44252";"Has Hildegard gone missing before?"
"228103012-0-44257";"What is it you do here?"
"228103012-0-44269";"There's something you need to know."
"228103012-0-44275";"Any idea who the Provincial Governor wants dead?"
"228103012-0-44293";"You're acting very strangely."
"228103012-0-44296";"What's going on in Kvatch?"
"228103012-0-44299";"Before I go and speak with her, can you tell me what Mirabelle was so upset about?"
"228103012-0-44300";"How long has Hildegard been missing?"
"228103012-0-44305";"I take it that's not the way things are usually done?"
"228103012-0-44314";"Tell me about Lyra Viria."
"228103012-0-44317";"Do you think anyone in here can really help us?"
"228103012-0-44318";"I'll handle the Chanter. Where can I find him?"

"228103012-0-44324";"What exactly happened to your former sanctuary?"
"228103012-0-44327";"Here's the wyrd blossom you wanted. Can Kireth return to work now?"

"228103012-0-44362";"I killed the Black Dragon."
"228103012-0-44365";"Do you want me to kill the Black Dragon?"
"228103012-0-44368";"Yes. I'm curious about the notice you posted."
"228103012-0-44372";"You want me to just go up and kill a random person in cold blood?"
"228103012-0-44374";"How do you know so much about a secret organization of assassins?"
"228103012-0-44375";"You mentioned that some of the people on the list are associates of yours?"
"228103012-0-44381";"Why do you think Anvil is the place to get noticed?"
"228103012-0-44384";"Has anyone else approached you about this job?"
"228103012-0-44386";"Keep talking like that and you'll have more than one murderer to worry about."
"228103012-0-44389";"I understand that you received a threatening sweetroll recently."

"228103012-0-46319";"I need to know more about those locations before I head out."
"228103012-0-46336";"Any idea why visitors have been scarce?"
"228103012-0-46338";"Can you tell me what happened in the mine?"
"228103012-0-46340";"Revus believes he might have a royal kwama egg you can use."
"228103012-0-46341";"How did you get locked in there?"
"228103012-0-46342";"Baladas said it's a queen egg for the mine. It's just, well, preserved."
"228103012-0-46346";"So are you sure this is the tomb you were looking for?"
"228103012-0-46351";"Do you know anything about divine energy?"
"228103012-0-46366";"What are these stones?"
"228103012-0-46372";"How do I find these shrines?"
"228103012-0-46379";"Why don't you have a key to your own mine?"
"228103012-0-46382";"Why are you concerned that something improper is going on with the mine?"
"228103012-0-46386";"What kind of resistance should I expect?"
"228103012-0-46388";"Well, I was sent to ask you about the transfer of divine energy."
"228103012-0-46390";"These notes are helpful, but could I ask you a few more questions?"
"228103012-0-46395";"I'm looking into something for Lord Vivec."
"228103012-0-46396";"How do we find the secret entrance?"
"228103012-0-46399";"Tell me about the scroll you gave to me."
"228103012-0-46407";"I'm still not sure I understand what you need me to do."
"228103012-0-46408";"Deshaan, if you will."
"228103012-0-46409";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-46410";"Grahtwood, please."
"228103012-0-46411";"I should place an item on the tomb"
"228103012-0-46415";"Greenshade, if you will."
"228103012-0-46416";"Auridon is my destination."
"228103012-0-46417";"Malabal Tor, if you please."
"228103012-0-46418";"Reapers March, if you will."
"228103012-0-46419";"Stonefalls, if you please."
"228103012-0-46420";"Shadowfen is my destination."
"228103012-0-46422";"Eastmarch, if you please."
"228103012-0-46423";"The Rift, please."
"228103012-0-46427";"Is that the emergency? The people want to see Lord Vivec?"
"228103012-0-46429";"You're just going to read the documents? I thought we could discuss what I learned."
"228103012-0-46434";"I need make an offering"
"228103012-0-46435";"Are you going to keep singing?"
"228103012-0-46440";"Do you always sing to people who just try to talk to you?"
"228103012-0-46445";"You were right. A hidden passage led to an older section of the tomb."
"228103012-0-46452";"Glenumbra, please."
"228103012-0-46458";"Rivenspire, if you will."
"228103012-0-46460";"Alik'r Desert, if you please."
"228103012-0-46461";"Bangkorai, if you please."
"228103012-0-46469";"Glirion said I should introduce myself."
"228103012-0-46471";"What kind of resistance should I expect?"
"228103012-0-46478";"What do you do here?"
"228103012-0-46486";"No. Whatever killed those people tore them apart like a ravenous beast."
"228103012-0-46489";"Calm down. I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-46493";"You really didn't know about this?"
"228103012-0-46496";"How long will you be meeting with this Councilor Rayveth?"
"228103012-0-46498";"He said he was attacked by something called ""The Ruddy Man."""
"228103012-0-46505";"That looked like no dreugh I've ever seen."
"228103012-0-46508";"I'm not sure. I need to consult with my contact."
"228103012-0-46511";"Tell me more about Stromgruf and your missing items."
"228103012-0-46516";"Where can I find Farseer Kuamta?"
"228103012-0-46518";"Why are so many Ashlanders here?"
"228103012-0-46519";"A rampage?"
"228103012-0-46523";"You mentioned a tomb?"
"228103012-0-46525";"Your brother rules over the Ashlander tribes?"
"228103012-0-46530";"I'm <<1>>. What happened here?"
"228103012-0-46533";"I've come to pay my respects, farseer."
"228103012-0-46538";"Can you tell me more about the job?"
"228103012-0-46539";"Can you tell me more about the job?"
"228103012-0-46540";"What is a Bthark Prism?"
"228103012-0-46541";"Why is Artisan Lenarmen trying to abduct you?"
"228103012-0-46543";"Tell me about the workers who are still missing."
"228103012-0-46547";"What happened exactly? Did Lenarmen ambush you?"
"228103012-0-46548";"Neramo mentioned the Heart of Lorkhan. Do you think it's here?"
"228103012-0-46549";"When do you plan on coming out of the shadows?"
"228103012-0-46556";"You're awfully—"
"228103012-0-46557";"You're awfully…—"
"228103012-0-46558";"What language was that greeting in?"
"228103012-0-46559";"What language was that just now?"
"228103012-0-46560";"What language was that just now?"
"228103012-0-46561";"What language was that just now?"
"228103012-0-46564";"You seem to have a knack for getting into tight situations."
"228103012-0-46567";"I guess that old scroll was wrong."
"228103012-0-46571";"I'm looking for the Hleran Ancestral Tomb. Do you know anything about it?"
"228103012-0-46575";"She said there's a tomb nearby, but restless spirits haunt its halls."
"228103012-0-46580";"You're not forgotten. Your descendent, Drelyth Hleran, sent me."
"228103012-0-46589";"Who are the beasts that brought you here?"
"228103012-0-46592";"What's Chodala going to do?"
"228103012-0-46595";"Where is the Cavern of the Incarnate?"
"228103012-0-46599";"Galgalah has her."
"228103012-0-46600";"You've dealt with a puzzle like this before?"
"228103012-0-46601";"You mentioned a Dwemer control rod?"
"228103012-0-46606";"This is about Chodala and the Nerevarine, right?"
"228103012-0-46615";"Any hint in that old scroll about what we'll find down here?"
"228103012-0-46625";"I communed with the Incarnates, just as the Wise Woman commanded."
"228103012-0-46630";"You were right. It was the Hleran tomb. Your ancestor, Dranoth, told me to give you this spear."
"228103012-0-46637";"I spoke to some of the Incarnates and they gave me these scrolls."
"228103012-0-46643";"How can I help you if I can't talk during the council?"
"228103012-0-46648";"Here's your Dwemer control rod, Neramo."
"228103012-0-46651";"If the hold stands there may still be time."
"228103012-0-46657";"You managed to get everyone out?"
"228103012-0-46663";"Yes, I have it here."
"228103012-0-46666";"Try Incarnate Ranso's scroll."
"228103012-0-46667";"Perhaps Incarnate Aduri's scroll is the best to counter this argument."
"228103012-0-46668";"Incarnate Danaat's scroll should disprove that assumption."
"228103012-0-46670";"I'm not here to hurt you. Are you a prisoner here?"
"228103012-0-46671";"Are you a prisoner here?"
"228103012-0-46672";"What do you mean, ""everywhere?"""
"228103012-0-46673";"I'm here to help. Are you a prisoner here?"
"228103012-0-46676";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-46685";"She said you were her champion and that I would need your help."
"228103012-0-46689";"What just happened here?"
"228103012-0-46690";"So what should we do?"
"228103012-0-46696";"Did Malur give you the scroll?"
"228103012-0-46699";"What will House Hlaalu do about the mine?"
"228103012-0-46701";"What about these kwama egg-hands? Could they help?"
"228103012-0-46704";"I'll go back to Ald'ruhn and seek out Seryn."
"228103012-0-46705";"Malur Rethan is dead."
"228103012-0-46711";"What happened back there?"
"228103012-0-46713";"What happened back there?"
"228103012-0-46716";"Can I ask you something?"
"228103012-0-46728";"The kwama's queen is dead. Foreman Lathdar is furious."
"228103012-0-46731";"Don't relax yet. The foreman says Gnisis remains shut down due to the death of the kwama queen."
"228103012-0-46733";"Don't relax yet. The foreman says Gnisis remains shut down due to the death of the kwama queen."
"228103012-0-46736";"If you love eggs so much why do you leave them in an unguarded open-air hatchery?"
"228103012-0-46739";"If you have no idea which heap contains the royal egg, how do we know which heap to take to Gnisis?"
"228103012-0-46740";"If you have no idea which egg is which, how do we make sure we get the right egg to Gnisis?"
"228103012-0-46742";"So how do we keep the queen from hatching?"
"228103012-0-46743";"So how do we get the eggs out?"
"228103012-0-46744";"Maybe you should have left the skull where you found it?"
"228103012-0-46745";"So how do we get the eggs out?"
"228103012-0-46747";"Do you have any better ideas?"
"228103012-0-46748";"Do you have any better ideas?"
"228103012-0-46749";"Do you have any better ideas?"
"228103012-0-46750";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-46752";"So that's it? You're giving up?"
"228103012-0-46753";"That's it? You're giving up?"
"228103012-0-46754";"That's it? You're giving up?"
"228103012-0-46755";"The egg is hatching?"
"228103012-0-46777";"There's a new kwama queen in the nursery. It just hatched and appears healthy."
"228103012-0-46779";"There's a new kwama queen in your mines. It just hatched and appears healthy."
"228103012-0-46781";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-46782";"I'm just glad things are somewhat back to normal."
"228103012-0-46794";"Can you arrange passage for me?"
"228103012-0-46795";"Grahtwood, please."

"228103012-0-46944";"Can you tell me anything about this song?"
"228103012-0-46947";"Take this. It's a tonal inverter. It should disrupt the staff's power for a short amount of time."
"228103012-0-46953";"We did what was necessary."
"228103012-0-46957";"We defeated Chodala and brought back Sunna'rah."
"228103012-0-46960";"The Archcanon seemed to know that Sunna'rah wasn't going to help Lord Vivec."

"228103012-0-46980";"Did House Redoran ever show up to help with the mines?"
"228103012-0-46981";"Not exactly. A Dark Elf swept in, bought the deed, and gave it to a wizard named Jinrisa."
"228103012-0-46983";"Never mind me—you were being attacked by Daedra!"
"228103012-0-46987";"Tell me more about Savarak."

"228103012-0-47006";"What exactly are these Stones of Cold Fire?"
"228103012-0-47011";"I got the deed back from Jinrisa. You can give it to Firuth, as you planned."
"228103012-0-47014";"What flaw made you fail to fulfill the prophecy?"
"228103012-0-47015";"They decided you weren't the Nerevarine. Why?"
"228103012-0-47016";"What ended your quest to become the Nerevarine?"
"228103012-0-47019";"Sun-in-Shadow thought you might be interested in the deed to some land outside of Vos."
"228103012-0-47020";"Relax, I'm here to help. What was that you said about cultists?"
"228103012-0-47025";"You must be Tythis. Trilam told me the situation with your sister."
"228103012-0-47029";"Actually, Lord Vivec sent me to see what the cultists are up to."
"228103012-0-47031";"Yes. Master Firuth agreed to endorse you."

"228103012-0-47040";"What do you know about this place?"
"228103012-0-47046";"Councilor Eris sent me to ask about the investigation to find his daughter."
"228103012-0-47047";"Eris said if I had questions about Veya, I could come to you."
"228103012-0-47048";"Eris said if I had questions about Veya, I could come to you."

"228103012-0-47056";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-47059";"Her diary and those records I recovered may be able to help you."
"228103012-0-47062";"Is there no cure for this affliction?"
"228103012-0-47063";"How did you become afflicted?"
"228103012-0-47065";"Why would you agree to this?"
"228103012-0-47086";"Veya's friends are trying to get a letter to someone named Drevis, but I lost them."
"228103012-0-47094";"Where can I find the Overseer?"
"228103012-0-47095";"The Council rejected your petition."
"228103012-0-47096";"I have a few questions about the Council and the magisters."
"228103012-0-47101";"The Overseer? I need to find her for Lord Vivec!"
"228103012-0-47107";"Lord Vivec needs to borrow the Blessing Stone again."
"228103012-0-47110";"I retrieved the Blessing Stone."
"228103012-0-47114";"I need to speak with Magister Gothren."
"228103012-0-47115";"I'd like to speak to Magister Gothren."
"228103012-0-47116";"Why would you help me?"
"228103012-0-47118";"Thanks. What's next?"
"228103012-0-47120";"I'm here about the job you posted."
"228103012-0-47121";"Lord Vivec said I could ask you some questions."
"228103012-0-47125";"Lord Vivec said to ask you for guidance in this matter."
"228103012-0-47130";"No, the tonal inverter worked fine. Azura wants you to help me get to the Clockwork City."
"228103012-0-47135";"I need to speak with the magister about my associate, Sun-in-Shadow's, petition for advancement."
"228103012-0-47136";"I'm here about the job you posted."
"228103012-0-47139";"Something like that. His servant sent me here to gather up Gothren's stolen goods."
"228103012-0-47141";"Who is Falura?"
"228103012-0-47148";"Ralasa Delvi sent you?"
"228103012-0-47149";"Councilor Eris just wants to find his daughter. Will the note you received help me accomplish that?"
"228103012-0-47151";"I want to know where Veya is and what that note says about her."
"228103012-0-47152";"If I do this, Halinjirr's crops might never grow back."
"228103012-0-47154";"What do you mean by less conventional?"
"228103012-0-47156";"I want to know where Veya is and what that note says about her."

"228103012-0-47162";"Why have you been avoiding House Redoran's soldiers?"

"228103012-0-47168";"What makes skooma so dangerous?"
"228103012-0-47174";"I have the staff, but the last time it nearly killed you."
"228103012-0-47177";"Falura Uveleth uncovered Halinjirr's activites."

"228103012-0-47226";"I was told you have information on retrieving items from Nchuleft."
"228103012-0-47230";"Did you find further adventure in Wrothgar?"
"228103012-0-47234";"I've already accepted the job, actually."
"228103012-0-47235";"I secured Otheri's journal, as promised. Here it is."
"228103012-0-47236";"Arith has it."
"228103012-0-47240";"So, is being the Mouth of Magister Gothren all you thought it would be?"

"228103012-0-48688";"That's the Clockwork City? It's so small!"
"228103012-0-48691";"I need to talk to you about Farwen."
"228103012-0-48692";"I need to talk to you about Farwen."
"228103012-0-48693";"I need to talk to you about Farwen."
"228103012-0-48694";"You know how to operate that terminal?"
"228103012-0-48695";"What do you hope to discover?"
"228103012-0-48696";"You don't seem very concerned that this place is a death trap."
"228103012-0-48698";"You mentioned a family disagreement?"
"228103012-0-48699";"So Veya is your daughter?"
"228103012-0-48700";"Did the other miners make it out?"
"228103012-0-48702";"A dark Daedric pact? That's what I helped you achieve?"
"228103012-0-48704";"Why keep me in the dark?"
"228103012-0-48708";"Are you not frightened of what is to come?"
"228103012-0-48717";"I thought I would visit under better circumstances than the last time we met."
"228103012-0-48719";"You don't seem to like the idea that the councilor wants help in this matter."
"228103012-0-48720";"Sergeant Faldrus sent me. He said you needed help finding your daughter."
"228103012-0-48721";"Tell me more about this note you want me to follow."
"228103012-0-48722";"Tell me more about Veya's brother."
"228103012-0-48723";"Why have you been avoiding House Redoran's soldiers?"
"228103012-0-48724";"Why do you care what happens to Veya?"
"228103012-0-48725";"You're part of the Morag Tong too, aren't you?"
"228103012-0-48727";"Sounds like you had some experience getting on Veya's bad side."
"228103012-0-48728";"Veya couldn't wait, so we went to find the soldiers who were scouting the old fort."
"228103012-0-48729";"We can still save Eris and the rest of the councilors."
"228103012-0-48732";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-48733";"How do I get to Sadrith Mora?"
"228103012-0-48734";"Do you really believe Davyth Fyr would vaporize you for a late shipment?"
"228103012-0-48736";"I came to find you to ask you—"
"228103012-0-48739";"Where did this young woman go?"
"228103012-0-48740";"Did you see where she went?"
"228103012-0-48742";"I have some questions, before I head out."
"228103012-0-48743";"Can I ask you about this job?"
"228103012-0-48744";"Can I ask you about this job?"
"228103012-0-48745";"You think Barbas was able to enter the Clockwork City?"
"228103012-0-48746";"Lord Vivec, there are still some things I don't understand."
"228103012-0-48747";"Lord Vivec, there are still some things I don't understand."
"228103012-0-48748";"Lord Vivec, there are still some things I don't understand."
"228103012-0-48749";"Lord Vivec, there are still some things I don't understand."
"228103012-0-48750";"Lord Vivec, there are still some things I don't understand."
"228103012-0-48751";"Are you doing all right after all this?"
"228103012-0-48752";"Are you doing all right after all this?"
"228103012-0-48756";"Were you able to figure out how to restore Vivec's power?"
"228103012-0-48758";"We've been through a lot."
"228103012-0-48760";"Tell me about the Battleground games."
"228103012-0-48762";"Tell me about Team Deathmatch."
"228103012-0-48763";"Tell me about the Battleground games."
"228103012-0-48766";"You've gotten the blessing, I take it?"
"228103012-0-48767";"Does the blessing usually have this effect?"
"228103012-0-48771";"Why aren't you helping her set things up?"
"228103012-0-48772";"Theyo told me to come help you place the wards."
"228103012-0-48773";"Theyo told me to come help you place the wards."
"228103012-0-48774";"Theyo told me to come help you place the wards."
"228103012-0-48775";"Can you take me to distant shores?"
"228103012-0-48779";"Grahtwood, please."
"228103012-0-48780";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-48781";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-48782";"You must be Farwen."
"228103012-0-48785";"Is the hag behind all these troubles?"
"228103012-0-48786";"These are the weapons the Reachmen are making at the Forge?"
"228103012-0-48787";"What is that thundering sound?"
"228103012-0-48789";"The trees are spies? You're rambling."
"228103012-0-48790";"Where are they keeping the other captives?"
"228103012-0-48791";"Tell me about Capture the Relic."
"228103012-0-48794";"Yes. I found a creature in Gascone's office—some kind of Daedra. A pale woman by the looks of it."
"228103012-0-48796";"You shouldn't have followed me. You're lucky to be alive."
"228103012-0-48797";"Falkreath is a refuge?"
"228103012-0-48798";"I saw. Those Reachmen were like slavering animals."
"228103012-0-48801";"What are you planning?"
"228103012-0-48802";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-48803";"Your bloodlust. It's not natural."
"228103012-0-48810";"Are you exploring this old tomb?"
"228103012-0-48813";"What do you know of our enemy?"
"228103012-0-48818";"Yes. His shadow came to life and stabbed him."
"228103012-0-48822";"You mentioned an artifact. What did you and Skaldir discover that was so terrible?"
"228103012-0-48824";"Who are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-48826";"Who are the other people you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-48828";"I'm looking for a mage named Adeber. Do you know where he is?"
"228103012-0-48832";"He is. I'm sorry."
"228103012-0-48833";"Yes. I dealt with the shadow. You're safe now."
"228103012-0-48837";"I'm not here to harm you. Mages are being killed by their own shadows. Skaldir was one of them."
"228103012-0-48841";"Actually, I'm here about your brother."
"228103012-0-48844";"Yes. Bonafryd wants you to find a safe place to hide."
"228103012-0-48848";"What are you asking me to do?"
"228103012-0-48851";"You mentioned the Psijics?"
"228103012-0-48854";"What do you plan to do with this lantern and the lens?"
"228103012-0-48856";"Do you know anything about this Daedric artifact?"
"228103012-0-48858";"Bonafryd? How did you find me?"
"228103012-0-48862";"All right. We'll finish this investigation together."
"228103012-0-48864";"I'm sorry, but I think the person I'm meeting with wants me to come alone."
"228103012-0-48932";"Here's the rubbing from the ancestral tomb."
"228103012-0-48943";"Can you tell me more about this Clockwork City?"
"228103012-0-48947";"Do you have any plans for Vos now that Savarak is dead?"
"228103012-0-48949";"Who is this Eerika you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-48950";"Glad to see you survived."
"228103012-0-48951";"Why rally at the Hall of the Dead?"
"228103012-0-48952";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-48953";"You sound tired. Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-48955";"How do you know so much about Sotha Sil?"
"228103012-0-48956";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-48957";"You're wounded. Are you going to be alright?"
"228103012-0-48958";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-48959";"I thought this place was supposed to be safe."
"228103012-0-48960";"You think the Jarl's hall is still standing?"
"228103012-0-48961";"You're going to defend this spot by yourself?"
"228103012-0-48962";"What's it mean to be a Thane?"
"228103012-0-48963";"You seem pleased to see Eerika become Jarl."
"228103012-0-48965";"What's being a Thane entail, exactly?"
"228103012-0-48966";"I'm sorry about your father."
"228103012-0-48971";"What can you tell me about your order?"
"228103012-0-48972";"Yes. I have the black soul gem."
"228103012-0-48973";"Sovor Saryoni is dying. He thinks your experiment may be the key to saving his life."
"228103012-0-48978";"What's happening to Vivec again?"
"228103012-0-48986";"I brought the black soulgem."
"228103012-0-48987";"You're right to be worried. Divayth Fyr and I are investigating a Daedric plot in Clockwork City."
"228103012-0-48991";"I recently disrupted a Daedric plot in the Clockwork City."
"228103012-0-49008";"Yes. Could you tell me more about how this oil is used?"
"228103012-0-49011";"Yes, I'm going to find your flash stone and pellets. But what do you use them for?"
"228103012-0-49014";"Can you tell me more about these metallic fibers?"
"228103012-0-49017";"Razgurug said you're looking for wood husks and coal?"
"228103012-0-49020";"I am. Can you tell me about them?"
"228103012-0-49023";"What can you tell me about these satchels?"
"228103012-0-49033";"Vigil? Why are you guarding this field?"
"228103012-0-49034";"What were you doing out here when you found the mysterious portal?"
"228103012-0-49037";"Maybe we can help each other. I'm going after the Shadow, but I need information."
"228103012-0-49041";"Can you tell me more about Slag Town?"
"228103012-0-49044";"I found a way to pursue the Shadow of Sotha Sil. Gloaming Gates."
"228103012-0-49056";"I'm not here to discuss Sotha Sil. It's Gascone."
"228103012-0-49059";"Yes. Varuni wants you to conduct a city-wide search to bring him in for questioning."
"228103012-0-49062";"Why do you need me to gather supplies?"
"228103012-0-49065";"Yes. I've silenced the Bloodroot Forge, for now."
"228103012-0-49072";"No thanks. I need to track a missing person.  Luciana said you might have something that can help."
"228103012-0-49074";"Tell me about the Everwound Wellspring."
"228103012-0-49075";"Do you want me to find Sherizar?"
"228103012-0-49076";"What makes you think there's something wrong with the oasis?"
"228103012-0-49077";"Sherizar's the Wellspring's new apprentice."
"228103012-0-49078";"Speaking of apprentices, we were curious about the last few that were selected."
"228103012-0-49079";"Idrono said we should talk to you about—"
"228103012-0-49080";"Are you sure Snuffler can follow Gascone's trail?"
"228103012-0-49083";"It's too late to help the apprentices, but we should get out of here."
"228103012-0-49084";"I dealt with Lector Naril. But what do we do about this machine?"
"228103012-0-49085";"Do you remember how you got here?"
"228103012-0-49086";"You're dead! How can you be talking to me?"
"228103012-0-49092";"Falkreath Hold will stand another day, thanks to me."
"228103012-0-49096";"I'm looking for a mage named Adeber. Bonafryd sent me to warn him. His life may be in danger."
"228103012-0-49100";"What do you know about the Skeleton Key?"
"228103012-0-49101";"You have a prison in the basilica?"
"228103012-0-49102";"What did you do to that corpse?"
"228103012-0-49112";"What exactly would I be signing up for?"
"228103012-0-49113";"I did you a favor when I spared your life. Tell me what you know."
"228103012-0-49127";"Where can I find these Gloaming Gates?"
"228103012-0-49130";"Tell me about this contract."
"228103012-0-49136";"Here you go."
"228103012-0-49137";"You mentioned Sotha Sil. Who is he?"
"228103012-0-49139";"Why did Sotha Sil hide the Clockwork City here?"
"228103012-0-49140";"What do you hope to find in Clockwork City?"
"228103012-0-49149";"How do you get the plants to grow in metallic soil?"
"228103012-0-49151";"A new apprentice every year? Why do you need so many apprentices?"
"228103012-0-49152";"Did Gascone do this to you? Where is he?"
"228103012-0-49153";"What happened to Gathel?"
"228103012-0-49162";"Tell me about this covenant."
"228103012-0-49163";"Why did you mention Clavicus Vile earlier? Are his agents in the Clockwork City?"
"228103012-0-49164";"I'm looking for Chancellor Gascone. Have you seen him?"
"228103012-0-49167";"Chancellor Gascone? Varuni sent me to find you.  We have some questions."
"228103012-0-49176";"How can I become a citizen?"
"228103012-0-49178";"It seems I won't be welcome in the city until I've found a sponsor."
"228103012-0-49186";"What have you done? Did you make a deal with these shadow cultists?"
"228103012-0-49187";"I killed him. He sold the city out to Clavicus Vile."
"228103012-0-49189";"He may be holding out for a better deal. He definitely knows things about our enemies."
"228103012-0-49191";"Start talking."
"228103012-0-49193";"Who are these cultists that were chasing you? Do they serve Clavicus Vile?"
"228103012-0-49196";"Was that really your shadow?"
"228103012-0-49206";"Tell me about this key."
"228103012-0-49211";"You let these Daedra in. You endangered everyone in Clockwork City."
"228103012-0-49215";"Is Raynor in trouble?"
"228103012-0-49216";"What will be lost?"
"228103012-0-49217";"Yes. Explosive oil harvested from dangerous firepot spiders."
"228103012-0-49218";"Yes, details would be nice."
"228103012-0-49220";"Who is the Astronomer?"
"228103012-0-49222";"What are the stars, exactly?"
"228103012-0-49230";"How do you propose we find this BAL-167?"
"228103012-0-49231";"What have you learned?"
"228103012-0-49232";"I'm sorry, but Constable Baldan's thugs knocked her out and dragged her off."
"228103012-0-49233";"I'm looking for a Dark Elf. Constable Baldan's thugs took her. Know where she might be?"
"228103012-0-49236";"I'm looking for a Dark Elf arrested by Constable Baldan. Know where she might be?"
"228103012-0-49239";"I'm looking for a Dark Elf. Baldan's thugs might have dragged her through here. Know anything?"
"228103012-0-49242";"I'm looking for a Dark Elf arrested by the Constable Baldan. Know where she might be?"
"228103012-0-49245";"Here's your core."
"228103012-0-49246";"Who is Divayth Fyr?"
"228103012-0-49249";"Actually, I came down here to find you. We should leave."
"228103012-0-49250";"I need to ask the crows something."
"228103012-0-49251";"Have you ever seen something like this before?"
"228103012-0-49261";"Can you tell me more about the Halls of Regulation?"
"228103012-0-49262";"That device can play Sotha Sil's memories?"
"228103012-0-49265";"I captured Kireth's abduction on this memory stone. Neramo has incriminating documents, too."
"228103012-0-49267";"You think he knows more than he's letting on?"
"228103012-0-49271";"I'm not a spy. I just want to talk."
"228103012-0-49272";"I'm here to register as a citizen."
"228103012-0-49273";"Constable Drados gave me this canteen as a gift for you."
"228103012-0-49275";"Why do you need to keep the stars stable?"
"228103012-0-49277";"What is the Mnemonic Planisphere?"
"228103012-0-49278";"So, what's next for you?"
"228103012-0-49281";"Why do you have to lose your memory?"
"228103012-0-49283";"Actually, they agreed to talk. But they want something of yours as tribute. A silver treasure."
"228103012-0-49293";"Did one of you steal a key from the Clockwork Basilica?"
"228103012-0-49295";"How did you get here?"
"228103012-0-49297";"Who are Kireth and Raynor?"
"228103012-0-49299";"Why do you need my help?"
"228103012-0-49300";"You think I can help you?"
"228103012-0-49303";"Who is Luciana Pullo?"
"228103012-0-49306";"Luciana mentioned the Clockwork Apostles."
"228103012-0-49324";"I'm not here to steal your treasure. I want an audience with the Duke of Crows."
"228103012-0-49326";"What else can you tell me about Divayth Fyr?"
"228103012-0-49333";"Are you fully restored?"
"228103012-0-49334";"I seek the key you stole from the Clockwork Basilica, your grace."
"228103012-0-49344";"Why are you fighting these Exarchs?"
"228103012-0-49345";"How did you get here?"
"228103012-0-49346";"What more can you tell me?"
"228103012-0-49348";"The Motionless Guardian?"
"228103012-0-49349";"Wait a minute. You said if I defeated the Exarchs, you'd give me the key."
"228103012-0-49351";"I guess. How do you plan to accomplish this?"
"228103012-0-49354";"I thought no one really knew Sotha Sil. How can you be sure something is wrong?"
"228103012-0-49356";"What's it like working for Provost Varuni?"
"228103012-0-49357";"You don't like working for Sotha Sil?"
"228103012-0-49358";"Lamp inventory?"
"228103012-0-49359";"Sotha Sil is definitely behaving strangely. He's made lots of odd demands."
"228103012-0-49363";"Actually, Divayth wants you and Raynor to help me with an important task."
"228103012-0-49366";"Sotha Sil asked me to find you."
"228103012-0-49367";"Where were you? Luciana and I nearly died fighting the Shadow."
"228103012-0-49375";"I'm listening."
"228103012-0-49376";"Do you have any lamp tubes like the ones in the loqutorium?"
"228103012-0-49377";"What are you talking about? You're taking me to the key now, right?"
"228103012-0-49380";"I need clockwork filaments. Have any on hand?"
"228103012-0-49381";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-49382";"Here's everything that was on your list."
"228103012-0-49383";"Yes. Neramo and Raynor constructed a working lamp. Kireth will deliver it soon."
"228103012-0-49384";"So I'll have to sneak past guards to get the lamp into position?"
"228103012-0-49385";"Yes. I placed the lamp. Everything is prepared."
"228103012-0-49387";"What can you tell me about these disappearances?"
"228103012-0-49388";"I think I have the right to know what you were really up to."
"228103012-0-49391";"Can you tell me more about Sotha Sil?"

"228103012-0-50219";"Justice has to be served. I'm going to tell the Sapiarchs the truth. You're going free."

"228103012-0-50394";"I was raised in Coldharbour by Molag Bal himself. I used to play hide-and-seek with his nephew."

"228103012-0-50428";"We'll perform together. What did you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-50432";"I trained with the Dragon Priests at the Throat of the World."
"228103012-0-50433";"I learned juggling from King Fahara'jad himself. He has a few hobbies."
"228103012-0-50434";"No one trained me. I've emerged from the womb already juggling knives."
"228103012-0-50435";"Do you have a sister?"

"228103012-0-50499";"[Let Rinyde Unmask Hopefuls] I understand. I won't interfere."

"228103012-0-50508";"I've spoken to Alchemy, and have a message from her about Larydel."
"228103012-0-50510";"I'm looking for a young High Elf called Arathel. Do you know anything about that?"
"228103012-0-50515";"Here's the amplification elixir you requested."
"228103012-0-50521";"Arathel's mother sent me to investigate his disappearance."
"228103012-0-50526";"No. I found a dead drop containing this note. It instructed me to meet someone here."
"228103012-0-50531";"Your mother's the one who sent me. I need to get you back to Mother's Den."
"228103012-0-50533";"Yes, you were under the influence of an illusion enchantment. Erudil sent me to help you."
"228103012-0-50541";"Have you ever heard of the Court of Bedlam?"
"228103012-0-50543";"I have a few questions before I head to Rellenthil."
"228103012-0-50548";"We learned the false Aldarch belonged to a Daedric cult called the Court of Bedlam."
"228103012-0-50553";"What do you mean the Dragon was your prize?"
"228103012-0-50554";"Why did you become a lich?"
"228103012-0-50556";"How did you wind up like that?"
"228103012-0-50560";"How might you be able to assist me?"
"228103012-0-50562";"What did you do to the Dragon bones?"
"228103012-0-50564";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-50568";"Any idea how I can hold her attention?"
"228103012-0-50572";"We're investigating reports of unusual occurrences here in Rellenthil."
"228103012-0-50576";"The Proxy Queen sent me to investigate the unusual deaths at this keep."
"228103012-0-50581";"I hope you can find rest now."
"228103012-0-50582";"What are you all doing out here?"
"228103012-0-50584";"Who are the Direnni?"
"228103012-0-50589";"Were Dragons really so fearsome?"
"228103012-0-50594";"I'm confident Orryn's getting his comeuppance in the hereafter."
"228103012-0-50595";"Wait, how do you know the killer is a Daedra?"
"228103012-0-50601";"Why won't the guards let you inside the keep?"
"228103012-0-50608";"She said that Nedoril attacked someone, and something about creatures."
"228103012-0-50612";"Arresting me would be a mistake. I found evidence of a Daedra summoning ritual."
"228103012-0-50619";"Who was that?"
"228103012-0-50628";"We will. First, we need to find that mage. Any ideas?"
"228103012-0-50631";"Are you and Hyircil going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-50635";"I'd like to talk to you about your investigation."
"228103012-0-50636";"I have some information related to your investigation here."
"228103012-0-50637";"Just how illegal is what we're about to do?"
"228103012-0-50641";"Why were you so mistrustful of Silurie? If you accepted her help earlier it could have saved lives."
"228103012-0-50645";"Enough. Last chance—who are you?"
"228103012-0-50651";"I ran into your mercenary on the way here. She says she quits."
"228103012-0-50652";"Do you know about Maestro Forte's expedition?"
"228103012-0-50665";"Don't worry, you're alive. Can I ask your name?"
"228103012-0-50671";"Andewen saved his life. He can't remember anything, but there are Daedra nearby."
"228103012-0-50675";"That does all seem strange, but what does it mean?"
"228103012-0-50678";"I just came through the door, to get back to our original time."
"228103012-0-50692";"Why do I hear a woman's voice reading these inscriptions?"
"228103012-0-50693";"What's a Sea Sload?"
"228103012-0-50701";"The Sea Sload K'Tora is working with the Court of Bedlam—including the Canonreeve's son."
"228103012-0-50705";"There has to be a catch. What is it?"
"228103012-0-50707";"Anything else I should keep in mind?"
"228103012-0-50710";"Nedoril's more than foolish. He killed a High Elf and is working with the Sea Sload."
"228103012-0-50718";"How did you know I came to collect aurialis?"
"228103012-0-50721";"I think you're hiding an aurialis. Show me where it is, or I'll rip your garden apart."
"228103012-0-50722";"A room at the local inn?"
"228103012-0-50723";"There has to be a catch. What is it?"
"228103012-0-50725";"You lied about there being no aurialis."
"228103012-0-50728";"I agreed to collect aurialis. I'm keeping my word."
"228103012-0-50729";"Conservation is important. I'll spare the plant."
"228103012-0-50737";"As an earl in the Court of Bedlam, why should I believe a word you say?"
"228103012-0-50740";"Livestock? You mean these bugs?"
"228103012-0-50746";"What are you doing here? What are you putting in this barrel?"
"228103012-0-50752";"Actually, I found the mer sabotaging you. And he said Vaerelel paid him to do it."
"228103012-0-50758";"Why would you think I'm here to rob you?"
"228103012-0-50763";"Why would I sell Tindoria's supplies to you?"
"228103012-0-50767";"I'm going to complete my contract with Tindoria."
"228103012-0-50768";"If you're paying double, I'll take that deal."
"228103012-0-50770";"I've gathered your reagents, but there was a … complication."
"228103012-0-50781";"Vaerelel?"
"228103012-0-50782";"Tindoria was your student?"
"228103012-0-50783";"Can you tell me about Vaeralel and Tindoria's relationship?"
"228103012-0-50787";"When was the last time anyone saw the abyssal pearl?"
"228103012-0-50795";"Nocturnal's earl says the words you remember are a spell that will reveal the Heart's location."
"228103012-0-50796";"The words are a key to unlock the stone inside whatever you hid it in."
"228103012-0-50799";"Do you remember anything else about this supposed spell?"
"228103012-0-50800";"Do you remember anything about this at all?"
"228103012-0-50809";"How do we activate the portal?"
"228103012-0-50812";"Why would you move the pearl and not tell anyone?"
"228103012-0-50813";"How were you able to evade capture?"
"228103012-0-50817";"I know about your relationship, but I don't know how it led to this attack."
"228103012-0-50820";"You hid the Heart of Transparent Law in Nocturnal's realm?"
"228103012-0-50825";"I should look into this."
"228103012-0-50826";"I should look into this."
"228103012-0-50827";"I should look into this."
"228103012-0-50828";"I should look into this."
"228103012-0-50829";"Are you sure this is where it is?"
"228103012-0-50830";"You intend to return to your people?"
"228103012-0-50837";"What did the crow mean by ""the featherless one walks the path once more""?"
"228103012-0-50838";"Did you remember where the stone is?"
"228103012-0-50839";"So you did accept an offer from Nocturnal?"
"228103012-0-50840";"The crows said you made a deal with Nocturnal. Do you have any memory of this?"
"228103012-0-50841";"What kind of aid did she offer you?"
"228103012-0-50842";"What did you agree to?"
"228103012-0-50843";"What did you agree to?"
"228103012-0-50845";"You think K'Tora is here?"
"228103012-0-50846";"We had no choice. A Maormer Sea Mage meant to use Sea Keep's power to destroy the coast."
"228103012-0-50852";"Can you tell me more about your expedition?"
"228103012-0-50862";"Killers? You mean killer."
"228103012-0-50864";"What's happening to the Ritemaster?"
"228103012-0-50865";"You think this is exciting?"
"228103012-0-50872";"Can you tell me more about your companions?"
"228103012-0-50873";"He was a business rival? I guess that makes you a suspect in his murder?"
"228103012-0-50876";"I found the Ul'vor Staff."
"228103012-0-50882";"If you know the locations, why do you need my help?"
"228103012-0-50885";"That back door is quite a vulnerability. Why didn't you seal it off completely?"
"228103012-0-50886";"Why keep on meeting in secret? There must have been a better way."
"228103012-0-50887";"I'm ready. Cast the spell and reveal where the Heart is hidden."
"228103012-0-50888";"I found this letter. Halimorion might have been abusing his Wood Elf workers—Farril specifically."
"228103012-0-50891";"Why did he think we were coming?"
"228103012-0-50892";"Yes. I've copied the book, though the phrasing was a bit strange."
"228103012-0-50901";"Nocturnal killed him. She has the Heart of Transparent Law now."
"228103012-0-50902";"Nocturnal has the Tower Stone."
"228103012-0-50904";"Nocturnal has the Tower Stone."
"228103012-0-50905";"I found this journal. Celan definitely killed Halimorion. Looks like he fled to a nearby shrine."
"228103012-0-50906";"You sound dissapointed."
"228103012-0-50907";"Where are Valsirenn and the Ritemaster?"
"228103012-0-50911";"I saw K'Tora's memories, but I'm not totally clear on what happened to you."
"228103012-0-50916";"You've been pierced by an arrow. Tell me everything you know. Quickly."
"228103012-0-50920";"Not exactly. Celan is dead. Killed by another Ghost of the Green."
"228103012-0-50924";"The Ritemaster is dead. Nocturnal killed him."
"228103012-0-50925";"A Wood Elf called Celan killed Halimorion, but a second Ghost of the Green shot and killed Celan."
"228103012-0-50931";"The Ritemaster is dead. Killed by Nocturnal's hand."
"228103012-0-50933";"The Ritemaster is dead. Killed by Nocturnal's hand."
"228103012-0-50937";"Nocturnal betrayed your Prince when she killed the Ritemaster and took the Heart for herself."
"228103012-0-50938";"The Triad is no more. Nocturnal betrayed the others and took the stone for her self."
"228103012-0-50939";"The Triad is no more. Nocturnal betrayed the others and took the stone for her self."
"228103012-0-50940";"Sotha Sil says that Nocturnal stole his secret for using life energy as a source of power."
"228103012-0-50941";"Is there any truth to what he said? About getting into the Tower?"
"228103012-0-50943";"Can you open it?"
"228103012-0-50945";"Nocturnal has the Heart of Transparent Law. This could be her doing."
"228103012-0-50947";"Did the Sapiarchs tell you what was going on?"
"228103012-0-50948";"Did the Sapiarchs tell you what was going on?"
"228103012-0-50950";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-50952";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-50955";"You don't seem very worried about Erilthel."
"228103012-0-50958";"What happened to the cult here?"
"228103012-0-50959";"How could I help you?"
"228103012-0-50961";"Ah … sure. How are you?"
"228103012-0-50964";"How's Erilthel holding up?"
"228103012-0-50967";"Isn't that still an option?"
"228103012-0-50969";"We can't give up."
"228103012-0-50971";"Who's your master?"
"228103012-0-50972";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-50975";"Your master?"
"228103012-0-50976";"Your master?"
"228103012-0-50977";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-50978";"Tell me about the gifts you brought with you."
"228103012-0-50979";"What does Rigurt need to do to secure an audience with the Proxy Queen?"
"228103012-0-50981";"Anything Rigurt should know before he meets with the Proxy Queen?"
"228103012-0-50982";"Enigma needs help preparing for her role as the Nord battle maiden, Hildegrom."
"228103012-0-50983";"Thanks for providing Rigurt with a writ of authenticity."
"228103012-0-50984";"Here are the recommendation, the writ, and the tickets you asked for."
"228103012-0-50985";"I need you to write a recommendation for Rigurt, the Nord ambassador."
"228103012-0-50986";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-50987";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-50989";"I need a writ of authenticity for Ambassador Rigurt of Skyrim."
"228103012-0-50990";"An artist named Tableau wishes to arrange a meeting with you at the nearby sinkhole."
"228103012-0-50991";"Why are you doing work for a noble?"
"228103012-0-50993";"Any idea how all these animals escaped?"
"228103012-0-50994";"You could threaten her with the information Justiciar Rolumdel provided. That might work."
"228103012-0-50998";"Justiciar Rolumdel suggested I remind you about that incident at the Battlereeve's dinner party."
"228103012-0-50999";"No. Talomar just asked for help finding his indrik, Lotus. Have you seen her?"
"228103012-0-51000";"She's been kidnapped. They left a note, demanding we meet with an Orc named Ghrum."
"228103012-0-51003";"I'm a friend of Tableau's. I'd like to see her."
"228103012-0-51005";"I think you'd best explain yourself."
"228103012-0-51006";"Why do you say that?"
"228103012-0-51013";"Manacar wants you to go back to Lilawen and become the famous artist he knows you can be."
"228103012-0-51015";"I think Tableau is capable of making her own decisions. Why can't you respect that?"
"228103012-0-51017";"Mehdze sent me to rescue you."
"228103012-0-51020";"I found your notes."
"228103012-0-51023";"Naliara's fine, but she quit."
"228103012-0-51028";"I'm here for a Deathlands Ale."
"228103012-0-51029";"Aren't you going to affect the past even more by staying back?"
"228103012-0-51030";"A dog spoke to you?"
"228103012-0-51032";"Someone hid a scroll at the marked location. <Show Talerion the scroll.>"
"228103012-0-51035";"A dog spoke to you?"
"228103012-0-51039";"The Ritemaster of the Psijic Order sent me to get your permission to enter the College of Sapiarchs."
"228103012-0-51041";"The Ritemaster of the Psijic Order sent me to get your permission to enter the College of Sapiarchs."
"228103012-0-51043";"Is there anything I should know about the College of Sapiarchs?"
"228103012-0-51046";"Is there anything I should know about the College of Sapiarchs?"
"228103012-0-51049";"I need to enter the College of Sapiarchs. The Proxy Queen said she would send word."
"228103012-0-51058";"Who was she?"
"228103012-0-51059";"Tell me what happened here."
"228103012-0-51060";"Wait. I'm a friend of the Mother of Rats. I'm trying to find a High Elf named Arathel."
"228103012-0-51063";"You wanted to talk to me?"
"228103012-0-51066";"Why did you call me here?"
"228103012-0-51067";"Why did you call me here?"
"228103012-0-51070";"I recovered the items stolen from Alinor Palace for Justiciar Rolumdel."
"228103012-0-51071";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-51072";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-51074";"I need two tickets to your next performance."
"228103012-0-51076";"Yes, I acquired items from the Khajiit, Breton, and Argonian just as he asked."
"228103012-0-51077";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-51078";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-51082";"The Proxy Queen promised she'd send word to grant us access to the College of Sapiarchs."
"228103012-0-51089";"Did the Goblins build this?"
"228103012-0-51090";"You think it'll be that bad?"
"228103012-0-51091";"What do you think will play better with the crowd?"
"228103012-0-51092";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-51093";"Why are you trying to make a record of the battles that occurred here?"
"228103012-0-51094";"It doesn't sound like you're Mehdze's biggest admirer."
"228103012-0-51096";"I'm looking for cultural items related to Summerset's newly arrived immigrants."
"228103012-0-51097";"I'm looking for cultural items related to Summerset's newly arrived immigrants."
"228103012-0-51098";"I'm looking for cultural items related to Summerset's newly arrived immigrants."
"228103012-0-51102";"Do you often get sensations like this?"
"228103012-0-51104";"What just happened?"
"228103012-0-51105";"Talomar asked me to help search for his indrik."
"228103012-0-51113";"How can I reach the Crystal Tower by going through your realm?"
"228103012-0-51114";"You still haven't told me what you want in return."
"228103012-0-51116";"I'm listening, Darien."
"228103012-0-51119";"Darien, why do you have Leythen out here when he's supposed to be a prisoner?"
"228103012-0-51121";"Darien said you were willing to put us in contact with Mephala."
"228103012-0-51124";"The Ritemaster of the Psijic Order sent us to warn you. The Crystal Tower has been compromised."
"228103012-0-51125";"Who was that anyway? Your boss?"
"228103012-0-51126";"I thought you didn't believe us."
"228103012-0-51129";"Tell me more about the tower sentinels."
"228103012-0-51130";"What could be in there that would be worth this much havoc?"
"228103012-0-51135";"What did you do to Leythen?"
"228103012-0-51137";"You're Valsirenn's husband? Why do you serve the Daedra now?"
"228103012-0-51141";"What do you suggest?"
"228103012-0-51143";"Who was that?"
"228103012-0-51147";"Nocturnal threatens us all. I've made a deal with Clavicus Vile. Now I want to negotiate with you."
"228103012-0-51148";"I've come to make a deal with you. I have already spoken to Clavicus Vile."
"228103012-0-51150";"I've come to make a deal with you. I have already spoken to Clavicus Vile."
"228103012-0-51151";"I found them. Leythen helped me determine Nocturnal's true plan. She wants to remake reality."
"228103012-0-51152";"I've attempted to make a deal with both Clavicus Vile and Mephala. I await their responses."
"228103012-0-51154";"Do you know a way inside the museum?"
"228103012-0-51155";"A hunted Sapiarch? That must be one of the tower sentinels. I came here to find them."
"228103012-0-51157";"No, I'm looking for a couple of Sapiarchs. Hannayel and Imedril. Are they here at the Academy?"
"228103012-0-51159";"This temple is a trap! We need to leave this forest, now."
"228103012-0-51164";"What are we looking for exactly? I don't know much about indriks."
"228103012-0-51169";"I was attacked by the other indriks when I was searching for Lotus. Is that normal?"
"228103012-0-51173";"If Vile and Mephala open the way, what's our plan for assaulting the Crystal Tower?"
"228103012-0-51174";"Best of luck."
"228103012-0-51176";"Is that why you sent for me?"
"228103012-0-51179";"Sapiarch Larnatille sent me to find you and the other tower sentinel."
"228103012-0-51181";"I'll protect the diamond. Sapiarch Larnatille sent me to find you. Hannayel is safe."
"228103012-0-51183";"One of the sentinels is under the protection of Razum-dar. The other one was slain by Mephala."
"228103012-0-51187";"And this Oracle mentioned me by name?"
"228103012-0-51194";"And this Oracle mentioned me by name?"
"228103012-0-51196";"Why did you come here to begin with?"
"228103012-0-51198";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"228103012-0-51199";"You have a problem with these people?"
"228103012-0-51200";"The outcasts claim you're trying to run them off the land. Is that true?"
"228103012-0-51207";"Vivienne asked me to speak to Emile. She believes he didn't murder Haladan."
"228103012-0-51217";"Your betrothed sent me to bring you back."
"228103012-0-51231";"Why would the gargoyles suddenly come to life?"
"228103012-0-51236";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-51238";"We've made a deal with Clavicus Vile and Mephala. We're going into the Tower."
"228103012-0-51243";"I found Justiciar Avanaire's journal."
"228103012-0-51245";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"228103012-0-51246";"How are your injuries?"
"228103012-0-51247";"We've made a deal with Clavicus Vile and Mephala. We're going into the Tower."
"228103012-0-51255";"Any theories?"
"228103012-0-51261";"Your daughter asked me to find you. The island is swarming with Maormer. Follow me."
"228103012-0-51264";"What are you looking for down here?"
"228103012-0-51269";"Sorry, not everyone made it."
"228103012-0-51271";"What exactly is this pearl?"
"228103012-0-51274";"We need divine energy to repair the Transparent Law crystal?"
"228103012-0-51275";"Stealing the stone won't be easy if Nocturnal is actively using it."
"228103012-0-51276";"Stealing the stone won't be easy if Nocturnal is actively using it."
"228103012-0-51278";"Did you suspect this at all?"
"228103012-0-51282";"I'm looking into Haladan's murder. Can you tell me what happened when Emile came back to the city?"
"228103012-0-51285";"Can I trust you to help us in this?"
"228103012-0-51286";"Are you ready to do this?"
"228103012-0-51287";"What do you know about this Saltbreeze Cave?"
"228103012-0-51288";"Why did you join the Court? What did you hope to accomplish?"
"228103012-0-51290";"How are you feeling?"
"228103012-0-51291";"How are you feeling?"
"228103012-0-51294";"You saw Haladan's body. What do you think happened to him?"
"228103012-0-51295";"We have a plan, but it involves a deal I made with Clavicus Vile and Mephala."
"228103012-0-51298";"Raz, what are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-51299";"Raz, what are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-51300";"Raz, what are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-51301";"Raz, what are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-51303";"We're heading to the Dreaming Cave. Hopefully, Vile and Mephala will honor their end of the bargain."
"228103012-0-51304";"Who are you? What are you doing down here?"
"228103012-0-51305";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-51309";"Have you seen any other outsiders down here? There are people missing from above."
"228103012-0-51315";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-51316";"Can you tell me a little about yourself?"
"228103012-0-51317";"Huh. I always got the impression you didn't like me."
"228103012-0-51321";"He actually gave me this book. It has a chapter on dueling customs."
"228103012-0-51322";"The Orc you insulted wants to face you in a duel. What does he need to do to make that happen?"
"228103012-0-51323";"I'm searching for an High Elf dueling foil."
"228103012-0-51326";"Yes. Roguzog stands ready to fight. He awaits Lirendel in the ruins west of the city."
"228103012-0-51327";"So you'll attune us to the Resolute Diamonds?"
"228103012-0-51328";"What happened exactly?"
"228103012-0-51329";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-51330";"Nocturnal's threat is more of a danger to you than me right now."
"228103012-0-51331";"Nocturnal's threat is more of a danger to you than me right now."
"228103012-0-51333";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-51334";"Can you tell me anything more about the cultists?"
"228103012-0-51337";"Spellbreaker? Was that what you wanted all along?"
"228103012-0-51344";"We still don't know what happened to Karnhar and the others."
"228103012-0-51346";"What was the Saviors' sacrifice?"
"228103012-0-51347";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-51350";"They didn't make it. I'm sorry."
"228103012-0-51357";"<Take sample of diseased corpse for later research.>"
"228103012-0-51358";"Here's a book on Altmer dueling rules."
"228103012-0-51363";"You mentioned a shield? Is that the prize Jorvuld agreed to give you?"
"228103012-0-51367";"<Take sample of disease concentrate for later research.>"
"228103012-0-51369";"We can enter the tower and reach Nocturnal from here?"
"228103012-0-51370";"Can we get in this way?"
"228103012-0-51372";"Can we get in this way?"
"228103012-0-51375";"Can you tell me a little about yourself?"
"228103012-0-51379";"What will happen if I burn your body?"
"228103012-0-51380";"What will happen if I light the brazier?"
"228103012-0-51381";"I've heard your song, but I have to know—what really happened here?"
"228103012-0-51388";"Nocturnal has taken control of the Crystal Tower. How do we ascend the tower from here?"
"228103012-0-51394";"Nocturnal is using the Crystal Tower for her own means. You and your allies were caught in it."
"228103012-0-51395";"What brought you to Lillandril?"
"228103012-0-51402";"Anyone in specific you want me to talk to regarding the Queen's decree?"
"228103012-0-51408";"I was wondering how your name ended up in the Divine Prosecution's observation log."
"228103012-0-51410";"You're not a High Elf. Have you lived in Summerset long?"
"228103012-0-51412";"I was wondering how your name ended up in the Divine Prosecution's observation log."
"228103012-0-51414";"Any ideas on how to break Pavo's character?"
"228103012-0-51415";"What do you know about Tanelwen's character, Inspector Vale?"
"228103012-0-51422";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-51426";"Not well. Daedra chased her from her hut and she came here, but all I found was this note."
"228103012-0-51427";"What's the Path to Alaxon?"
"228103012-0-51428";"I heard you made complaints in Shimmerene. Care to tell me about it?"
"228103012-0-51432";"Do you know how we can get through the gate?"
"228103012-0-51434";"The vessel? The last Light? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-51443";"You're in the Academy Stacks. You were possessed, I think."
"228103012-0-51448";"How did you fix it when the gem fell out before?"
"228103012-0-51453";"All right, I'll help you investigate the monastery."
"228103012-0-51463";"Darien sacrificed himself to restore the Dawnbreaker so I could repair the tower crystal."
"228103012-0-51467";"Transparent Law was made whole by the power of the Dawnbreaker."
"228103012-0-51468";"The stone is reforged by the power of the Dawnbreaker."
"228103012-0-51469";"The stone is reforged by the power of the Dawnbreaker."
"228103012-0-51471";"What can you tell me about Lorne?"
"228103012-0-51472";"You didn't suggest talking to Emile directly. Why?"
"228103012-0-51475";"Where can I find the people that have been sequestered?"
"228103012-0-51476";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-51481";"Yes. I've cleared out Scalecaller Peak."
"228103012-0-51489";"Fang Lair is free of the necromancers and their undead."
"228103012-0-51493";"What happened to the pearl? Did you destroy it?"
"228103012-0-51499";"Why didn't you bring an escort?"
"228103012-0-51501";"Good to see too, Lodiss. How are Ila and Jorvuld?"
"228103012-0-51503";"How long has the acropolis been this way?"
"228103012-0-51505";"No sign of Lotus, but something seems strange about the feed in her pen."
"228103012-0-51507";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-51508";"Tell me more about why you were sent to Summerset?"
"228103012-0-51509";"Why did the Ebonheart Pact send you to Summerset?"

"228103012-0-51513";"What's your story?"
"228103012-0-51517";"I'm here on Rigurt's behalf."
"228103012-0-51518";"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-51525";"You must be Mehdze. Naliara's fine, but she quit."
"228103012-0-51526";"Why do you use a cave as your port?"
"228103012-0-51527";"Tell me more about Madja's mutiny."
"228103012-0-51528";"Yes, he did. He wanted to make sure you're all right."
"228103012-0-51532";"Won't dumping these shipments leave you destitute?"
"228103012-0-51534";"What do you mean by darker forces?"
"228103012-0-51535";"Madja is dead and Nubani is fine. She'll meet with you later."
"228103012-0-51541";"Tell me more about the items you want Rigurt to acquire."
"228103012-0-51542";"Tell me more about the people you want us to talk to."

"228103012-0-51550";"I met a Psijic Sage inside the Monastery. She was looking for information as well."
"228103012-0-51552";"Valsiren wants to call for a gathering of Summerset leaders."

"228103012-0-51563";"What kind of deals?"
"228103012-0-51570";"What's an Undaunted?"
"228103012-0-51586";"It seems like they were expecting someone named Zaan. Any idea who that is?"
"228103012-0-51587";"Without the wards that keep people out, you need a new way to protect the tower."
"228103012-0-51589";"You're leaving? Is that wise?"
"228103012-0-51590";"It is."
"228103012-0-51591";"It is."
"228103012-0-51592";"It is."

"228103012-0-51620";"I recovered the items that were stolen from Alinor Palace."
"228103012-0-51621";"Lorne mentioned that some aspects of this case remind her of your first encounter with the Ghost."
"228103012-0-51624";"What exactly should I be looking for in the Wood Elf cottage?"
"228103012-0-51628";"We can't give up."
"228103012-0-51631";"You seem somewhat reluctant to accept the help of a newcomer."
"228103012-0-51632";"What's a justiciar?"
"228103012-0-51637";"Why would Darien set Leythen free and go with him to Summerset?"
"228103012-0-51638";"Do we have any idea what he's planning?"
"228103012-0-51644";"Someone scratched the word ""Eluvein"" into the wall."
"228103012-0-51652";"They were here though. This journal belonged to Karnhar."
"228103012-0-51654";"Yes, tell me what this is really about."
"228103012-0-51658";"Don't you need the shrine to contact Mephala?"
"228103012-0-51661";"How?"
"228103012-0-51666";"Can you tell me more about Ebon Stadmont?"
"228103012-0-51671";"I thought this language was ancient. How can you read it so easily?"
"228103012-0-51674";"What's wrong with the doors in this forest?"
"228103012-0-51676";"I'm sorry, but I have to know—who are the Keepers?"
"228103012-0-51678";"I only know you were trapped here."
"228103012-0-51682";"Couldn't you have arrested Nedoril instead of executing him?"
"228103012-0-51689";"Squire Bayenor said you wanted my help with that imminent threat."
"228103012-0-51692";"Tell me about the three adventurers you sent to investigate the Sea Sloads."
"228103012-0-51695";"Battlereeve Tanerline sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-51699";"I think you should tell me about the Sea Sload first."
"228103012-0-51703";"Battlereeve Tanerline sent me, and I'm as real as you are."
"228103012-0-51706";"The Orc you insulted wants to face you in a duel. What does he need to do to make that happen?"
"228103012-0-51708";"Anything I should know about Shimmerene before I head out?"
"228103012-0-51709";"I have a few more questions about all this, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-51710";"I have a few more questions about all this, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-51711";"I have a few more questions about all this, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-51722";"Are you sure you can win this duel?"
"228103012-0-51725";"What brings you to Summerset?"
"228103012-0-51728";"You seem more upset about your reputation than Niralin's safety."
"228103012-0-51738";"If the key doesn't work, how do we get through?"
"228103012-0-51740";"This was your plan all along?"
"228103012-0-51741";"Tell me about the three adventurers who volunteered to help you."
"228103012-0-51742";"You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?"
"228103012-0-51743";"You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?"
"228103012-0-51744";"You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?"
"228103012-0-51747";"Do you know anything else about the Sea Sloads?"
"228103012-0-51748";"Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sloads?"
"228103012-0-51749";"How are you going to investigate K'Garza?"
"228103012-0-51750";"What do you mean that Grog is chained up as a gift to appease the Sea Sload?"
"228103012-0-51751";"Why does Grog think the Sea Sload is responsible for the influx of undead?"
"228103012-0-51752";"Aren't you going to help me?"
"228103012-0-51755";"Is a permanent solution to the geysers even possible?"
"228103012-0-51757";"After I set Grog free, he ran off on his own."
"228103012-0-51758";"What is going on?"
"228103012-0-51761";"Is there anything I can do for your injuries?"
"228103012-0-51762";"I see you were able to make it back to the city."
"228103012-0-51763";"The Sea Sload threat is real. The marines didn't make it, but here's their report."
"228103012-0-51767";"Tell me more about hulkynds."
"228103012-0-51769";"Who is this Ghost of the Green?"
"228103012-0-51770";"Who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-51771";"What can you tell me about Lorne and Soravil?"
"228103012-0-51772";"Tell me what you know about the abyssal geysers."
"228103012-0-51774";"So you're a hulkynd?"
"228103012-0-51776";"Why is that especially important now?"
"228103012-0-51782";"What are you planning to scout?"
"228103012-0-51784";"Can we use the blood on the sickle to find out who the killer is?"
"228103012-0-51787";"Who are you anyway?"
"228103012-0-51788";"Aren't there other keepers who could help us?"
"228103012-0-51791";"You said there are undead here?"
"228103012-0-51792";"What exactly are we hoping to find here?"
"228103012-0-51803";"What makes this Eye of Remembrance so special?"
"228103012-0-51807";"Place an element of ritual onto the table"
"228103012-0-51814";"Do you know anything about that pearl we found?"
"228103012-0-51816";"I'd like to know more about your position in the Psijic Order."
"228103012-0-51819";"Just how was someone able to break into the vault?"
"228103012-0-51823";"Place an element of ritual onto the table"
"228103012-0-51827";"Place an element of ritual onto the table"
"228103012-0-51831";"Why have you been trying to contact me?"
"228103012-0-51835";"Why have you been trying to contact me?"
"228103012-0-51838";"Why have you been trying to contact me?"
"228103012-0-51841";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-51843";"How do you propose I unlock the chains?"
"228103012-0-51844";"Have you quit being Telenger's assistant then?"
"228103012-0-51847";"So, Soravil did all this just to hurt you."
"228103012-0-51853";"Yes, Grog uncovered information about the Sea Sload called K'Garza."
"228103012-0-51857";"Why did you open the Illuminus in the first place?"
"228103012-0-51862";"And what is the plan, exactly?"
"228103012-0-51865";"I'll lead you out of Karnwasten."
"228103012-0-51866";"If you're not Glardir, who are you?"
"228103012-0-51869";"Are you going to tell us who you are yet?"
"228103012-0-51871";"How does the story go? Who are you?"
"228103012-0-51877";"Who is Torchbug?"
"228103012-0-51885";"What did the Sload and the High Elf talk about?"
"228103012-0-51888";"Do you often deputize total strangers?"
"228103012-0-51890";"Yes. You're the Brave Little Scrib."
"228103012-0-51892";"Yes, I'm interested in contract work."
"228103012-0-51895";"What is the Psijic Order?"
"228103012-0-51900";"Tell me more about the Divine Prosecution."
"228103012-0-51901";"What kind of assignments can I expect?"
"228103012-0-51905";"What's your interest in the cultural items you requested?"
"228103012-0-51906";"Can you tell me anything more about the stolen items?"
"228103012-0-51907";"What's so hard about getting into character?"
"228103012-0-51908";"We did as you asked. Rigurt shouldn't have to wait five weeks to see the Proxy Queen."
"228103012-0-51909";"What do you mean it changed?"
"228103012-0-51910";"I saved the Oracle from Mephala's realm. They tried to use her to find Artaeum."
"228103012-0-51917";"Were you in command of the keep before it fell into the hands of the Maormer?"
"228103012-0-51922";"Who are the Maormer and why did they attack you?"
"228103012-0-51923";"What can you tell me about the keep we're infiltrating?"
"228103012-0-51924";"Have you had any other visions we need to worry about?"
"228103012-0-51927";"A pie? Are you a baker?"
"228103012-0-51930";"Yes, very. So you're Investigator Vale?"
"228103012-0-51935";"If you didn't steal the pie, then who did?"
"228103012-0-51938";"Who stole Investigator Vale's pie?"
"228103012-0-51944";"I stopped Nocturnal, but I don't know what became of her."
"228103012-0-51949";"All right. Who is the guilty party?"
"228103012-0-51957";"What was that Soravil was talking about? A death-memory ritual?"
"228103012-0-51958";"I have a few more questions about all this, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-51959";"This map will show me where the time breaches are located?"
"228103012-0-51962";"What is your role here in the Psijic Order, Celarus?"
"228103012-0-51963";"You are Tanelwen. Try to focus."
"228103012-0-51968";"What does it take to become a Psijic?"
"228103012-0-51970";"So, what's next?"
"228103012-0-51972";"So what's next?"
"228103012-0-51973";"You have another friend that needs rescuing, right?"
"228103012-0-51974";"You're not a wretched beggar. You're the victim of an enchantment."
"228103012-0-51978";"What can you tell me about the Sea Mage we're after?"
"228103012-0-51983";"I have a few more questions about all this, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-51984";"You have a name: Wheedle, the Beggar Prince."
"228103012-0-51986";"Yes, I sealed all the breaches on Summerset."
"228103012-0-51998";"That's because you were never diseased at all. You aren't the Beggar Prince. You are Pavo."
"228103012-0-51999";"And what purpose would that be?"
"228103012-0-52000";"Yes. The Illuminus caused you to believe you were a beggar. Erudil is looking at the book now."
"228103012-0-52004";"The Illuminus caused you to believe you were a beggar. Erudil is looking at the book now."
"228103012-0-52005";"How did you become involved with Pandermalion?"
"228103012-0-52014";"What's the situation?"
"228103012-0-52017";"Why does your affair merit this much destruction?"
"228103012-0-52019";"What should we do?"
"228103012-0-52028";"Is there a Meridia cult on Summerset?"
"228103012-0-52029";"What do you know about other daedric cults on Summerset?"
"228103012-0-52031";"What do you know about other daedric cults on Summerset?"
"228103012-0-52037";"Rescuing Pavo caused the book to change again?"
"228103012-0-52038";"Why would the Court of Bedlam destroy a shrine to Meridia?"
"228103012-0-52039";"She said she's going to stir up stories in the library."
"228103012-0-52041";"I broke the Illuminus's hold on Tanelwen."
"228103012-0-52042";"Why did they lock you in a cage?"
"228103012-0-52045";"Her persona was brave to a fault. Scaring her with a spider broke the spell."
"228103012-0-52048";"What's a dead Skaafin doing in a monastery devoted to the Eight?"
"228103012-0-52049";"What are they doing to  these newcomers?"
"228103012-0-52053";"What is the Dreaming Cave?"
"228103012-0-52054";"What was that projection you were looking at?"
"228103012-0-52055";"What is this projection of yourself?"
"228103012-0-52056";"Emile, I'm here to talk about Haladan's murder. Did you really kill him?"
"228103012-0-52057";"Why can't we use the Dreaming Cave to contact Meridia?"
"228103012-0-52058";"Where can I find Leythen?"
"228103012-0-52064";"Will this barrier prevent us from using the Dreaming Cave?"
"228103012-0-52065";"Will this barrier prevent us from using the Dreaming Cave?"
"228103012-0-52066";"How do you know we can trust Leythen?"
"228103012-0-52067";"How do you know we can trust Leythen?"
"228103012-0-52072";"Lorne told me about her husband—and your wife."
"228103012-0-52081";"Shouldn't Leythen be locked away somewhere?"
"228103012-0-52082";"Why is Leythen out here?"
"228103012-0-52083";"Why is Leythen out here?"
"228103012-0-52084";"That mammoth by the toppled wall. It looks like it bashed its own head in."
"228103012-0-52089";"Yes. He said you had books for me."
"228103012-0-52092";"Is there anything else you can tell me about these attacks?"
"228103012-0-52096";"You scribbled those skeevers on the walls to recruit worshipers for a Daedric Prince?"
"228103012-0-52100";"You painted those skeevers so that people could find you? In a place that outlaws daedric worship?"
"228103012-0-52101";"You painted those skeevers so that people could find you? In a place that outlaws daedric worship?"
"228103012-0-52102";"You painted those skeevers so that people could find you? In a place that outlaws daedric worship?"
"228103012-0-52105";"What's the significance of these religious articles I'm supposed to recover?"
"228103012-0-52106";"Vinelore said she was taking Lotus to the inner paddocks. Who would you rather trust?"
"228103012-0-52109";"What exactly happened to the Cult of Meridia?"
"228103012-0-52111";"What's important about the Rose-of-Archon?"

"228103012-0-52113";"How much of a threat are reef vipers?"
"228103012-0-52114";"Tell me about your colleague."
"228103012-0-52115";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-52118";"Arathel's innocent. An evil sorcerer tried to use him to kill the Sapiarch, but the boy refused."
"228103012-0-52119";"Any idea what that could be?"
"228103012-0-52121";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-52124";"Who do the Sapiarchs believe your friend murdered?"
"228103012-0-52128";"Associates like Manacar?"
"228103012-0-52129";"You're wounded. I'll find Lotus."
"228103012-0-52133";"How did you get involved in this? I thought you said Artaeum was sent away."
"228103012-0-52146";"Tell me about Russafeld winery."
"228103012-0-52147";"I found this note and pendant near Nafarion's corpse. He wished for you to have them."
"228103012-0-52150";"TOC"
"228103012-0-52158";"Manacar mentioned you owed him a favor."
"228103012-0-52161";"Can you tell me more about gryphons?"

"228103012-0-52186";"There was a wrecked cart in the pass, but no bodies. I did find this locket."
"228103012-0-52188";"What is going on? We thought you were kidnapped."
"228103012-0-52189";"What is going on? We thought you were kidnapped."
"228103012-0-52191";"How do you know Manacar?"
"228103012-0-52193";"It seems you and Tableau have grown awfully close since we last met."
"228103012-0-52196";"Who were those bandits with you?"
"228103012-0-52200";"I think they founded the town, based on what I could glean from that statue's inscription."
"228103012-0-52207";"I understand you're good with languages."
"228103012-0-52210";"I need your help with a translation."
"228103012-0-52212";"I found a journal that belonged to someone named Rultari. A child of the family here."
"228103012-0-52218";"A letter from a relative who didn't approve of bringing the sick onto the estate."
"228103012-0-52221";"I'm not leaving anyone behind."
"228103012-0-52223";"What are you doing to Faidur?"
"228103012-0-52225";"I came here to return the people you've taken."
"228103012-0-52227";"How long have you been like this?"
"228103012-0-52229";"How did you end up down here?"
"228103012-0-52230";"Khavid told me where to find you. He's wounded."
"228103012-0-52231";"We need to get out of here."
"228103012-0-52237";"Do you really expect Leythen to help us?"
"228103012-0-52238";"Are you sure this is the right thing to do? Leythen is our enemy."
"228103012-0-52239";"Are you sure this is the right thing to do? Leythen is our enemy."
"228103012-0-52241";"Shouldn't Valsirenn ask Leythen for this favor?"
"228103012-0-52243";"What's going on between you and Valsirenn?"
"228103012-0-52245";"What was that about with Valsiren just now?"
"228103012-0-52246";"What was that about with Valsiren just now?"
"228103012-0-52247";"What was that about with Valsiren just now?"

"228103012-0-52249";"What should I do once I get to Ebon Stadmont?"
"228103012-0-52252";"What are your thoughts on what happened?"
"228103012-0-52253";"Do you know anything about what happened?"
"228103012-0-52254";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-52262";"Excuse me?"
"228103012-0-52265";"What should I be looking for?"
"228103012-0-52267";"What am I looking for?"
"228103012-0-52270";"Is the island dangerous?"
"228103012-0-52271";"Tell me about your father."
"228103012-0-52272";"You don't care for sailing?"
"228103012-0-52280";"Why is the Ritemaster sending you to Rellenthil?"
"228103012-0-52289";"Nocturnal's earl said that the ancient phrase is a spell."
"228103012-0-52292";"How did the Court know we were going to be here?"
"228103012-0-52294";"You knew exactly when and where to contact me. How?"
"228103012-0-52295";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"228103012-0-52299";"How do you know so much about this?"
"228103012-0-52300";"How many people made up your fleet?"
"228103012-0-52301";"How do you know so much about this?"
"228103012-0-52310";"Nuzir trusted me to recover the shipments. Why should I betray him?"
"228103012-0-52311";"If this is a school, where are the professors?"
"228103012-0-52317";"Can you tell me a little about this place?"
"228103012-0-52318";"Yes. Here's your dueling foil. I've got a copy of his name as well."
"228103012-0-52319";"Enough threats. I hearby formally issue Roguzog's challenge."
"228103012-0-52320";"Why do you think the Canonreeve's son Nedoril and his friends gather at the sinkhole?"
"228103012-0-52330";"The words are a key to unlock the stone inside whatever you hid it in."
"228103012-0-52332";"Maybe we should leave the Heart of Transparent Law hidden away."
"228103012-0-52334";"Is going after the stone really our only option?"
"228103012-0-52337";"Did you tell the Ritemaster?"
"228103012-0-52339";"And what did it mean?"
"228103012-0-52345";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-52346";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52347";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52348";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52349";"I'm not a memory. Oriandra sent me to rescue you."
"228103012-0-52352";"Why are you experimenting on the indriks?"
"228103012-0-52354";"Why aren't you more concerned about this mind trap?"
"228103012-0-52355";"How will I know a spell particle when I see it?"
"228103012-0-52357";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52360";"You're at odds with Faidur?"
"228103012-0-52363";"What else can you tell me about the sinkholes and the sounds coming from the manor?"
"228103012-0-52364";"No Cainar. It's time to leave. You have to wake up!"
"228103012-0-52366";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-52367";"Tell me what happened."
"228103012-0-52369";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52371";"What did you want to see me about?"
"228103012-0-52373";"I'm going to find Lotus."
"228103012-0-52374";"Why would the vandal target you specifically?"
"228103012-0-52378";"How do you know this Wood Elf, Eslion, is responsible?"
"228103012-0-52381";"Why do you think the strangler infestation and the vandalism are related?"
"228103012-0-52387";"Your family doesn't seem terribly interested in this land."
"228103012-0-52390";"Are you Eslion?"
"228103012-0-52394";"Even if the stranglers were an accident, why were you vandalizing Vinafwe's work in the first place?"
"228103012-0-52397";"What brought you to Summerset?"
"228103012-0-52401";"Could this plague have been dormant until the sinkholes exposed it to the surface?"
"228103012-0-52403";"Nubani actually told me quite a bit about your days at sea. Including your smuggling."
"228103012-0-52404";"Who was it?"
"228103012-0-52408";"Curtaros sent me to find you. He said to meet him at the old lovers' tree."
"228103012-0-52409";"Curtaros sent me to find you. He said to meet at the old lovers' tree."
"228103012-0-52413";"Why did you start smuggling items into Summerset?"
"228103012-0-52416";"I poisoned them as you instructed."
"228103012-0-52417";"I'll testify on your behalf. [Eslion Goes Free]"
"228103012-0-52419";"You broke the law, Eslion. You have to face the consequences. [Eslion Goes to Jail]"
"228103012-0-52421";"Do you really think he'll cause more problems if released?"
"228103012-0-52423";"You're caught in a mind trap. Take these items and remember who you are, Miriya."
"228103012-0-52426";"How do you survive down here?"
"228103012-0-52427";"Where did you say the people from above went again?"
"228103012-0-52430";"Curtain call? Wait, I just killed you! After you killed Andewen!"
"228103012-0-52431";"The Ritemaster is dead. Killed by Nocturnal's hand."
"228103012-0-52432";"Thanks for helping me, but who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-52439";"Nocturnal's no longer working with the other Daedric Princes."
"228103012-0-52440";"What did you mean to tell the Ritemaster?"
"228103012-0-52445";"Wait! I still have questions. Who are you?"
"228103012-0-52448";"I already know the basics of crafting jewelry."
"228103012-0-52450";"What materials do I need?"
"228103012-0-52455";"Where can I find pewter dust?"
"228103012-0-52459";"Don't worry. Ruliel sent me to look for you."
"228103012-0-52460";"How do I refine this dust?"
"228103012-0-52462";"How'd you end up here?"
"228103012-0-52464";"And what purpose would that be?"
"228103012-0-52465";"I have pewter ounces. What now?"
"228103012-0-52468";"Nothing good. See for yourself."
"228103012-0-52478";"What are you drinking?"
"228103012-0-52480";"What have you become?"
"228103012-0-52481";"Why do Arillas and the others call you their Saviors?"
"228103012-0-52482";"How did Corgrad come to be buried?"
"228103012-0-52484";"What else can you tell me about Traitor's Vault?"
"228103012-0-52492";"What do you know about this Keelsplitter?"
"228103012-0-52493";"Where can I find pewter dust?"
"228103012-0-52494";"Is there anywhere I can purchase pewter dust?"
"228103012-0-52495";"I have a ring. Does that mean I'm certified?"
"228103012-0-52496";"Why would I deconstruct something?"
"228103012-0-52497";"What exactly is deconstruction?"
"228103012-0-52504";"Thanks for helping me, but who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-52509";"Will you tell anyone what you found here?"
"228103012-0-52510";"If you can use your station to help these people, please do. They have no where else to go."
"228103012-0-52511";"Are you recovering?"
"228103012-0-52513";"The Triad is no more. Nocturnal betrayed the others and took the stone for her self."
"228103012-0-52517";"You're safe now. Miranrel is waiting for you by the road."
"228103012-0-52518";"You're safe now. Miranrel is waiting for you by the road."
"228103012-0-52520";"How did you end up so close to a gryphon nesting ground?"
"228103012-0-52521";"Right …. So, what happened in here?"
"228103012-0-52524";"These ruins, what is this place?"
"228103012-0-52535";"How do I research traits?"
"228103012-0-52536";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-52539";"Who is Telenger the Artificer?"
"228103012-0-52541";"Your caretaker, Josajeh, sent me. I need your help to find time breaches in Summerset."
"228103012-0-52545";"Your master sent me. He told me to collect a map, some Psijic Seals, and the Augur of the Obscure."
"228103012-0-52549";"What kind of dog is Eustasia?"
"228103012-0-52550";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-52581";"Why are the yaghra invading the island?"
"228103012-0-52584";"I can take care of myself."
"228103012-0-52585";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-52586";"I've cleared out Moon Hunter Keep."
"228103012-0-52588";"Indrik heart?"
"228103012-0-52589";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-52590";"I made my way through the March of Sacrifices."

"228103012-0-52639";"Go on."
"228103012-0-52643";"I should look into this."
"228103012-0-52649";"The Sea Sload called itself K'Tora."
"228103012-0-52650";"The Sea Sload called itself K'Tora and mentioned an Abyssal Cabal."
"228103012-0-52651";"Tell me more about Cloudrest."
"228103012-0-52652";"Your son Vandoril asked me to travel here. He believed you were in danger."
"228103012-0-52653";"You were down below when this happened?"
"228103012-0-52654";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-52656";"What do you know of Z'Maja?"
"228103012-0-52657";"Tell me more about the Welkynars."
"228103012-0-52658";"I can't help but notice the gryphon behind you."
"228103012-0-52659";"How was Z'Maja able to use this magic?"
"228103012-0-52660";"How are your companions?"
"228103012-0-52661";"Will rebuilding your order be difficult?"
"228103012-0-52662";"Are your fellow Welkynars well?"
"228103012-0-52663";"How goes training new riders?"
"228103012-0-52664";"What are you doing in Shimmerene?"
"228103012-0-52678";"Tell me about yourself."

"228103012-0-52759";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-52771";"I've collected an indrik heart for you."
"228103012-0-52772";"You seem rather happy that Nafarion died."
"228103012-0-52773";"How can the Crystal Tower exist on multiple planes at the same time?"
"228103012-0-52777";"How can the Crystal Tower exist on all planes at once?"
"228103012-0-52781";"Are you really going to eat an indrik heart?"
"228103012-0-52784";"Why would Nocturnal betray the triad and take the Heart?"
"228103012-0-52786";"Why did you set us up?"
"228103012-0-52788";"How were the Princes planning to enter the Crystal Tower?"

"228103012-0-52791";"How did you know what Nocturnal was planning?"
"228103012-0-52792";"Nocturnal has the Heart of Transparent Law. Maybe that has something to do with this."
"228103012-0-52793";"What are the Sapiarchs doing exactly?"
"228103012-0-52800";"What does Clavicus Vile want?"
"228103012-0-52802";"Your master?"
"228103012-0-52803";"Your master?"
"228103012-0-52808";"Why does the door concern you?"
"228103012-0-52816";"Does the Proxy Queen know who you are?"
"228103012-0-52818";"So K'Tora has been controlling your actions for all these years?"
"228103012-0-52819";"Why are so few allowed to join?"
"228103012-0-52826";"Do you have any idea what happened to Arathel?"
"228103012-0-52827";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-52830";"Who are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-52833";"We've made a deal with Clavicus Vile and Mephala. We're going into the Tower."

"228103012-0-52839";"How's your sister, Rinyde?"
"228103012-0-52840";"Tell me about joining the House of Reveries."
"228103012-0-52868";"I'm willing to risk it."
"228103012-0-52871";"Why did you join the Court? What did you hope to accomplish?"
"228103012-0-52873";"What's the Green Pact you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-52879";"Manacar couldn't deliver the heart because he had another obligation."
"228103012-0-52882";"I'm ready to begin the assault of the Crystal Tower."
"228103012-0-52883";"Who are you, anyway?"
"228103012-0-52885";"How did your meeting with the Proxy Queen go?"
"228103012-0-52889";"Why are you called Igeke Rat-Bite?"
"228103012-0-52890";"Who are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-52891";"Sober Storn? Odd name for a Nord."
"228103012-0-52896";"How well do you know Arathel?"
"228103012-0-52899";"What can you tell me about Mirulon and his group?"
"228103012-0-52903";"So what are you going to do next?"
"228103012-0-52905";"So there never was any treasure to begin with?"
"228103012-0-52907";"Are you ready to face him?"
"228103012-0-52908";"So you wanted to become an explorer like Gjadil?"
"228103012-0-52910";"You're talking like it's already over."
"228103012-0-52914";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-52931";"Why are you so interested in the situation here? Are you a vigilante or something?"
"228103012-0-52935";"Learn what?"
"228103012-0-52940";"You're alive. Just keep doing what you normally do and everything will be fine."
"228103012-0-52941";"What did you mean when you said that Mirulon aims to bend Arathel's mind?"
"228103012-0-52946";"What were you and your friend talking about before I arrived?"
"228103012-0-52955";"Here's what I was able to find."
"228103012-0-52957";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-52959";"A code? Can you figure it out?"
"228103012-0-52962";"Tell me what you know about the abyssal geysers."
"228103012-0-52965";"How did Teraniel get the better of you and Hyircil?"
"228103012-0-52966";"Is there anything I can do to help with the investigation?"
"228103012-0-52967";"What's your history with the Divine Prosecution, and these two?"
"228103012-0-52970";"What does foreign magic have to do with believing us?"
"228103012-0-52971";"Are all your cases like this?"
"228103012-0-52972";"Back in the ruins, you said you and Silurie used to play there. Why?"
"228103012-0-52973";"I should place a book."
"228103012-0-52984";"I should place a book."
"228103012-0-52985";"I should place a book."
"228103012-0-52986";"I should place a book."
"228103012-0-53007";"What happened to the portal?"
"228103012-0-53033";"You think you're a poor student?"
"228103012-0-53040";"You mentioned the Staff of Towers?"
"228103012-0-53043";"Predicament? What's the matter?"
"228103012-0-53046";"Loremaster Celarus sent me to speak with you."
"228103012-0-53049";"Yes, I recovered all four."
"228103012-0-53055";"Who was Tenerive?"
"228103012-0-53059";"Are you all right, Josajeh? Celarus is worried about you."
"228103012-0-53062";"Yes, I closed all the time breaches."
"228103012-0-53065";"Why do you say that?"
"228103012-0-53066";"Have you made any progress with the staff?"
"228103012-0-53072";"Yes, I placed all the Psijic Seals and closed the breaches."
"228103012-0-53075";"Sure, Loremaster. What's on your mind?"
"228103012-0-53079";"So that's it? The Sea Sload escaped?"
"228103012-0-53080";"Yes. I collected all four fragments."
"228103012-0-53083";"Yes. The Loremaster sent me to collect my gear."
"228103012-0-53086";"Yes, all the breaches in Rivenspire are sealed."
"228103012-0-53089";"Yes. Are you all right, Josajeh?"
"228103012-0-53092";"Josajeh?"
"228103012-0-53095";"No one was hurt. Why did you do it, Josajeh?"
"228103012-0-53098";"So she's being ejected from the Psijic Order?"
"228103012-0-53101";"The Augur seems fond of Josajeh, and she's a powerful mage. What if she took it into exile?"
"228103012-0-53103";"You're right. We can't risk the Augur falling into the wrong hands. It should go to the vault."
"228103012-0-53105";"Celarus agreed to let the Augur leave the island … under your supervision."
"228103012-0-53115";"Do you have any idea where you'll go?"
"228103012-0-53118";"Celarus asked me to inform you that the Augur of the Obscure will not be returning to the vault."
"228103012-0-53121";"What exactly is this Augur of the Obscure, anyway?"
"228103012-0-53125";"What can you tell me about these Psijic Seals?"
"228103012-0-53127";"So you're Celarus's apprentice?"
"228103012-0-53134";"Yes. I'd like to go to Summerset."
"228103012-0-53135";"I'd like to leave Summerset."
"228103012-0-53136";"Grahtwood, please."
"228103012-0-53137";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-53138";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-53146";"I have a few questions first."
"228103012-0-53160";"Thanks for helping me, but who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-53161";"Why aren't you more concerned about this mind trap?"
"228103012-0-53165";"I'm here about a favor for Vindilwe."
"228103012-0-53167";"Why do you care so much about this one indrik?"
"228103012-0-53168";"You're more than just a keeper here, aren't you?"
"228103012-0-53171";"Have any theories as to what we'll find in the Conservatory?"
"228103012-0-53180";"Yes. Let's get moving."
"228103012-0-53199";"I need you to summon together leaders and influential members of Summerset first."
"228103012-0-53201";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-53203";"Where do you think you'll travel first?"
"228103012-0-53204";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-53205";"How's the meeting going so far?"
"228103012-0-53215";"What's the first order of business, Acting Conservator?"
"228103012-0-53217";"How are things with Elise?"
"228103012-0-53221";"We need to make sure the Crystal Tower is protected into the future. So we don't fail again."
"228103012-0-53222";"That's why we need to make sure the Tower is protected now. So we don't fail again."
"228103012-0-53230";"Did you bring all these people here?"
"228103012-0-53231";"You brought all these people here?"
"228103012-0-53234";"I need to speak to Kinlady Avinisse."
"228103012-0-53240";"Where's Valsirenn right now?"
"228103012-0-53263";"You must have some idea where these bottles are."
"228103012-0-53270";"Is there anything else you can tell me about these attacks?"
"228103012-0-53271";"What am I looking for?"
"228103012-0-53272";"What do you mean? What's this have to do with Nocturnal?"
"228103012-0-53273";"Veya from Balmora? You're Nocturnal's earl? How did that happen?"
"228103012-0-53278";"And why would your Master want to help?"
"228103012-0-53288";"I don't have time to sit for a painting."
"228103012-0-53290";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-53293";"Didn't you lead an expedition into Ebon Stadmont?"
"228103012-0-53296";"Do they know about what we discovered in Traitor's Vault?"
"228103012-0-53302";"You're recruiting?"
"228103012-0-53308";"The Fighters Guild is recruiting?"
"228103012-0-53312";"The Mages Guild?"
"228103012-0-53315";"The Mages Guild?"
"228103012-0-53318";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-53321";"Did you see Brengas with her? His cousin said he may be in trouble too."
"228103012-0-53324";"And you have no idea what language the voice is speaking in?"
"228103012-0-53325";"You remember where you hid the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"228103012-0-53326";"You remember where you hid the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"228103012-0-53328";"Complications, Raz? That sounds ominous."
"228103012-0-53331";"Cloak-and-dagger work? Sounds ominous."
"228103012-0-53334";"Valsirenn said you remembered something."
"228103012-0-53336";"You remembered something else?"
"228103012-0-53337";"Do you know where your father ran off to?"
"228103012-0-53338";"Do you know anyone by the name of Wendlain?"
"228103012-0-53340";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-53341";"I'm sorry I didn't arrive in time to save Cartorrel."
"228103012-0-53342";"I'm sorry for your loss. She left this letter for you."
"228103012-0-53344";"Maybe in a bit. I had some things to ask first."
"228103012-0-53354";"Remind me about the significance of the Heart of Transparent Law."
"228103012-0-53359";"Do you know why Sotha Sil wants to see me?"
"228103012-0-53361";"Darien and Leythen are returning to Artaeum. They both will fight with us."
"228103012-0-53362";"You haven't been able to determine anything useful about the pearl?"
"228103012-0-53365";"How can we help protect the Crystal Tower?"
"228103012-0-53366";"How can we convince the Sapiarchs to accept help?"
"228103012-0-53368";"What are you doing with the abyssal pearls?"
"228103012-0-53370";"What are you doing with these pearls?"
"228103012-0-53371";"What are you doing with these pearls?"
"228103012-0-53372";"What are you doing with these pearls?"
"228103012-0-53376";"What do you mean about Tableau's stage name?"
"228103012-0-53378";"Remind me, what's going on again?"
"228103012-0-53383";"You don't seem very concerned for your husband."
"228103012-0-53384";"Why haven't you looked for them yourself?"
"228103012-0-53385";"Why do you need me for this? You are the most powerful mages on Nirn."
"228103012-0-53388";"The Triad is no more. Nocturnal betrayed the others and took the stone for her self."
"228103012-0-53389";"What are you going to do about your late husband?"
"228103012-0-53392";"You said Josajeh might use the mine as a springboard to an unfamiliar place?"
"228103012-0-53395";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53397";"How did you know what Nocturnal was planning?"
"228103012-0-53398";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53399";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53401";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53404";"I don't think you've been completely truthful about what happened here."
"228103012-0-53406";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53408";"If the ritual has already begun, how do I stop it?"
"228103012-0-53415";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53416";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53417";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53418";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-53419";"What have you been up to since we stopped that shadow on Dranil Kir?"
"228103012-0-53422";"I saved Clockwork City from Nocturnal. I even saved Sotha Sil."
"228103012-0-53425";"What do you do here?"
"228103012-0-53428";"Sure. What did you want to talk about?"
"228103012-0-53433";"I wanted to ask you something."
"228103012-0-53443";"Do you know where Razum-dar is?"
"228103012-0-53444";"How's everything in the House of Reveries?"
"228103012-0-53445";"How are you, Andewen?"
"228103012-0-53447";"How can I reach the Crystal Tower by going through your realm?"
"228103012-0-53453";"The one with the lute?"
"228103012-0-53457";"Can you tell me more about your work here?"
"228103012-0-53459";"Could you tell me more about what exactly you're doing out here?"
"228103012-0-53460";"Is Mehdze going to pay me for doing all this?"
"228103012-0-53464";"I can help you run some lines."
"228103012-0-53471";"What's been going on since the last time I saw you?"
"228103012-0-53472";"What's been going on since the last time I saw you?"
"228103012-0-53473";"What's been going on since the last time I saw you?"
"228103012-0-53474";"Cinucil sent me to find you. What are you doing in this vault?"
"228103012-0-53477";"There's a lot of blood on your hands. You think you deserve his forgiveness?"
"228103012-0-53480";"I'd like to learn more about Artaeum."
"228103012-0-53481";"I am an investigator for the Proxy Queen. I have some questions."
"228103012-0-53485";"I'd like to know more about the Ceporah Tower."
"228103012-0-53492";"I found a secret room in the barracks where a Daedric summoning took place. Did you know about that?"
"228103012-0-53494";"How are you different from the Mages Guild?"
"228103012-0-53495";"Are things returning to normal now that the Daedra is gone?"
"228103012-0-53498";"You seem awful touchy."
"228103012-0-53499";"Before we go to the Dreaming Cave, can I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-53510";"It was a unique experience. I'll say that much."
"228103012-0-53514";"I appreciate you coming to vouch for me."
"228103012-0-53519";"I'm just whatever's needed at the time."
"228103012-0-53523";"Are you absolutely certain Josajeh interfered with your research?"
"228103012-0-53526";"Celarus told me that the Augur will light a path to the fragments. What does that mean?"
"228103012-0-53528";"You made it home, I see."
"228103012-0-53531";"What have you been up to since you escaped?"
"228103012-0-53532";"It's not my business either way. I was just the go between."
"228103012-0-53535";"Who are you looking for?"
"228103012-0-53538";"Andiryewen said you wanted to talk to me?"
"228103012-0-53546";"How does this ward breaker work?"
"228103012-0-53553";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53554";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53555";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53556";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53557";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53558";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53559";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53560";"How is the Ritemaster doing?"
"228103012-0-53564";"Darien, why do you have Leythen out here when he's supposed to be a prisoner?"
"228103012-0-53565";"What did you mean, Nocturnal's earl has your sword?"
"228103012-0-53571";"Who is Vykosa?"
"228103012-0-53574";"You said you were a member of the Silver Dawn?"
"228103012-0-53577";"I see you picked up a new a friend."
"228103012-0-53578";"Why do you need wolfsbane?"
"228103012-0-53579";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-53580";"Do you think you can really be cured?"
"228103012-0-53581";"I don't have the necessary ingredients."
"228103012-0-53582";"I have the necessary ingredients."
"228103012-0-53584";"Why didn't you kill Narazda?"
"228103012-0-53585";"Why not ask Adonatus to cure you?"
"228103012-0-53586";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-53587";"So you're going to help us defeat Vykosa?"
"228103012-0-53588";"Who is Moon-Caller?"
"228103012-0-53589";"Tell me more about Clavicus Vile."
"228103012-0-53590";"Is she close?"
"228103012-0-53591";"Tell me about the garden."
"228103012-0-53592";"Why would you have bad memories about this room?"
"228103012-0-53593";"So you're a werewolf."
"228103012-0-53594";"What did you give to Adonatus?"
"228103012-0-53595";"Tell me more about Clavicus Vile."
"228103012-0-53600";"Tell me about the Hunting Grounds."
"228103012-0-53601";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-53612";"What can you tell me about this indrik we're hunting?"
"228103012-0-53613";"Where exactly are we?"
"228103012-0-53615";"I didn't find the ingredients, though. You'll still be a werewolf."
"228103012-0-53616";"I also have the ingredients to cure you."
"228103012-0-53630";"Your father seemed to think you shouldn't be here."
"228103012-0-53631";"Who were those women who attacked us?"
"228103012-0-53633";"But then you would be miserable."
"228103012-0-53636";"What can I expect from the Wispwood?"
"228103012-0-53637";"What did Tarcyr do to these Nords?"
"228103012-0-53638";"Any idea who Balorgh is?"
"228103012-0-53642";"What makes your group so special?"
"228103012-0-53645";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-53647";"Why do you need Hircine's boon?"
"228103012-0-53650";"What exactly is that light?"
"228103012-0-53659";"How can you complain that he's not respecting your wishes, when you refuse to respect his?"
"228103012-0-53670";"I wish both you and Pan luck."
"228103012-0-53671";"I seek information about Margus Derius."
"228103012-0-53674";"I'm still working on getting you that item."
"228103012-0-53679";"Does your black market deal in Argonian antiquities?"
"228103012-0-53682";"I haven't found your assistant yet."
"228103012-0-53686";"Safe journey to you."
"228103012-0-53687";"You're Eshundir the smuggler? I need to ask you about something."
"228103012-0-53688";"I still want to find out about Margus Derius."
"228103012-0-53694";"Yes, so far."
"228103012-0-53696";"You think things are that dire?"
"228103012-0-53697";"I'm here to rescue you. Xode sent me."
"228103012-0-53698";"Easy. I'm here to rescue you. Xode sent me."
"228103012-0-53701";"What kind of help do you need?"
"228103012-0-53706";"How do we bind the Wuju-Ka?"
"228103012-0-53708";"I'm a friend of Concordia. I recovered these antiquities for Cyrodilic Collections."
"228103012-0-53711";"I recovered these antiquities from the Sunless Hollow, but there was no sign of Margus Derius."
"228103012-0-53713";"What happened down here?"
"228103012-0-53717";"Eshundir was murdered, but I learned that the antiquities are leading Margus to something important."
"228103012-0-53721";"Before you go, tell me more about the Psijic Order."
"228103012-0-53723";"Could you tell me more about the mind trap before you go?"
"228103012-0-53724";"Thanks for helping me, but who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-53727";"Concordia wants us to talk to local Argonians with knowledge of antiquities from Murkmire."
"228103012-0-53730";"You really plan to pursue this Remnant of Argon?"
"228103012-0-53733";"Do you know where I can find the other captives?"
"228103012-0-53735";"What can you tell me about the Teeth of Sithis?"
"228103012-0-53745";"I need to find the Remnant of Argon."
"228103012-0-53754";"I'm not one of the Blackguards. I need you to tell me what you told them."
"228103012-0-53758";"I'm not one of the Blackguards. I'm trying to stop them from finding the cursed skull."
"228103012-0-53762";"I'm not one of the Blackguards, but I need to know what you told them."
"228103012-0-53766";"Yes. The Blackguards forced them to decipher a woodcut Margus found inside the nightmare idol."
"228103012-0-53769";"Is this xanmeer really that dangerous?"
"228103012-0-53772";"Yes, I have a few questions."
"228103012-0-53773";"Best of luck with your performance."
"228103012-0-53774";"Best of luck with your performance."
"228103012-0-53779";"No questions from me. Let's get going."
"228103012-0-53780";"What's that?"
"228103012-0-53783";"I found these pieces of a map."
"228103012-0-53797";"But we don't know where the island is located."
"228103012-0-53799";"Shouldn't you be preparing for the bonding ritual? You are the Moss-Skin suitor, right?"
"228103012-0-53807";"I'm working for Cyrodilic Collections. What can you tell me about Tsofeer Cavern?"
"228103012-0-53811";"My name is <<1>>. I'm helping Famia investigate a nearby xanmeer."
"228103012-0-53815";"All right. You don't need me to escort you any further?"
"228103012-0-53818";"I'm not sure what you're talking about."
"228103012-0-53819";"<Press the panel.>"
"228103012-0-53820";"I plumbed Frostvault and cracked open the Vault of Mhuvnak."
"228103012-0-53822";"This place is connected to the Wrathstone?"
"228103012-0-53823";"<Torch and scatter Meridia's sacred words.>"

"228103012-0-54517";"Does your tribe usually seek help from outsiders?"
"228103012-0-54521";"Anything else I should keep in mind for the next match?"
"228103012-0-54522";"Learn anything about Seeks-the-Dark?"
"228103012-0-54523";"What can you tell me about the Hall of Beasts?"
"228103012-0-54524";"Do you think you could help with the fight?"
"228103012-0-54525";"Tell me about Drakeeh."
"228103012-0-54526";"Learn anything else new?"
"228103012-0-54527";"The Vampire's Pen?"
"228103012-0-54528";"Learn anything new about Seeks-the-Dark?"
"228103012-0-54529";"Why did the Blackguards target you?"
"228103012-0-54530";"You don't seem very grateful for the rescue."
"228103012-0-54533";"Why are you looking for sealed scrolls?"
"228103012-0-54534";"Why are you looking for sealed scrolls?"
"228103012-0-54547";"Tell me more about the Argonian antiquities."
"228103012-0-54548";"I'm working for Cyrodilic Collections. Tell me about the armor you're interested in."
"228103012-0-54553";"Tell me more about the Blackguards."
"228103012-0-54561";"My name's not Mateem. It's <<1>>."
"228103012-0-54562";"Who is Fat Gixthi?"
"228103012-0-54564";"Who's Uraz?"
"228103012-0-54565";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-54566";"Why do you need candles lit for the Lost Legion?"
"228103012-0-54568";"What's going on?"
"228103012-0-54570";"What did I just witness?"
"228103012-0-54571";"How do I use the fire stones to find Kishi?"
"228103012-0-54572";"If novices keep dying, why is Mewah-Jez permitted to remain the war-teacher?"
"228103012-0-54574";"What's so important about your staff?"
"228103012-0-54575";"If Kishi leads the hatchlings to their death, why is he still allowed to hold his position?"
"228103012-0-54577";"Is this just a vision? Or is this really happening?"
"228103012-0-54579";"Why isn't the war-chief concerned about the deaths of the novices?"
"228103012-0-54586";"Do you believe Xukas heard something outside?"
"228103012-0-54587";"Anything I should keep an eye out for?"
"228103012-0-54588";"You're not coming with us?"
"228103012-0-54595";"Tell me about these tablets."
"228103012-0-54597";"What can you tell me about the Swallowed Grove?"
"228103012-0-54605";"What's happening?"
"228103012-0-54606";"You keep saying the Dead-Water are going extinct. How does no one else notice?"
"228103012-0-54607";"It was some kind of hunt. I think. But at the end—"
"228103012-0-54608";"What did the Ayleids want?"
"228103012-0-54609";"Is something wrong?"
"228103012-0-54611";"Do you know anything about the Swallowed Grove?"
"228103012-0-54613";"What can you tell me about these dream-wallows?"
"228103012-0-54614";"Do you know much about the Swallowed Grove?"
"228103012-0-54615";"What is starblossom for?"
"228103012-0-54617";"You're coming with us?"
"228103012-0-54618";"Do you know anything about the Swallowed Grove?"
"228103012-0-54622";"Aren't you staying behind?"
"228103012-0-54632";"Yes, he told me to gather these ingredients. He also knew the tablets were stolen."
"228103012-0-54634";"Tell me a bit more about this dispute."
"228103012-0-54640";"I'm here to talk to you about Nurhei and Paheiza's claim over the saltrice farm."
"228103012-0-54643";"<Remain silent.>"
"228103012-0-54646";"I have a few questions."
"228103012-0-54652";"I'd like to know who I'll be working with."
"228103012-0-54653";"How is the Wrathstone connected to this place?"
"228103012-0-54654";"What have you been doing since we last crossed paths?"
"228103012-0-54655";"There's something living in the caves here?"
"228103012-0-54656";"We know the Veeskhleel used you, Haxara. We just don't know why."
"228103012-0-54658";"No, but I found this pendant and some arrows."
"228103012-0-54661";"What can you tell me about the vault you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-54662";"I'm here on behalf of Sulahkeesh about the saltrice farm dispute."
"228103012-0-54663";"What's so important about this wooden box, anyway?"
"228103012-0-54675";"I'm here to talk about the saltrice farm."
"228103012-0-54679";"I don't understand why Mewah-Jez replaced Bhoki as the war-teacher."
"228103012-0-54682";"Why was Bhoki stripped of his title as trainer?"
"228103012-0-54683";"Why was Bhoki stripped of his title as trainer?"
"228103012-0-54684";"Will the war-chief really permit an outsider to walk the Path of the Lily?"
"228103012-0-54685";"Will the War-chief listen to us?"
"228103012-0-54692";"Did you find a wooden box in a nearby hackwing's nest?"
"228103012-0-54693";"I'm looking for a lost ceremonial box."
"228103012-0-54694";"Paheiza stole from her sister to pay for her skooma habit."
"228103012-0-54698";"You think you'll be able to get them to talk when Chuxu could not?"
"228103012-0-54699";"Your judgment seems harsh. Did they really deserve to die?"
"228103012-0-54701";"You must meet Sulahkeesh at the town's entrance. But first, rub this oil on your scales."
"228103012-0-54704";"I happened to find some letters between you and Paheiza."
"228103012-0-54706";"Yes, I was able to collect your hunting bow."
"228103012-0-54708";"Sulahkeesh wants you to negotiate with Nurhei at the town's entrance."
"228103012-0-54710";"I happened to read some letters between you and Nurhei."
"228103012-0-54716";"Why is it up to me?"
"228103012-0-54721";"Yes, I was able to recover the branch."
"228103012-0-54722";"Have you always carried this Hist branch with you?"
"228103012-0-54723";"Tell me about your travels."
"228103012-0-54724";"No, but I found these in the nest."
"228103012-0-54725";"How does creating art honor Sithis?"
"228103012-0-54726";"I've collected the ruin pieces, if that's what you mean."
"228103012-0-54727";"Any advice before I start the next part of the Path?"
"228103012-0-54728";"What should we watch out for?"
"228103012-0-54729";"What do you know of this place?"
"228103012-0-54730";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-54733";"She doesn't seem to care about anyone but herself. Did you hear anything that might help us?"
"228103012-0-54736";"Easy does it. What tree?"
"228103012-0-54739";"What can you tell me about this dreaming tree?"
"228103012-0-54743";"Can we talk about what just happened?"
"228103012-0-54747";"Where is Famia? Did she leave with Kassandra?"
"228103012-0-54749";"What is Kassandra thinking?"
"228103012-0-54751";"What can you tell me about the Deepmire?"
"228103012-0-54752";"Have you seen Famia?"
"228103012-0-54754";"The War-Chief plans on making you the tribe's trainer again."
"228103012-0-54755";"How would you punish Haxara for what she's done?"
"228103012-0-54758";"Tell me about Sithis."
"228103012-0-54763";"There's no way you could have fixed what Ree-Nakal had done. We've spared him a life of pain."
"228103012-0-54768";"Why do you feel you're safe among the Dead-Water tribe?"
"228103012-0-54770";"What if your daughter really is a threat to the Hist? You've caused a lot of harm already."
"228103012-0-54772";"You really think she's that much of a danger to your tribe?"
"228103012-0-54773";"Easy. Dajaleen sent me. You were the one who discovered the body?"
"228103012-0-54776";"Why do you need the nightbloom vines?"
"228103012-0-54778";"Are you Sulosya? I was told I could find him here."
"228103012-0-54780";"I'm searching for the Skin Taker. Sulosya says you chased them off."
"228103012-0-54785";"I'm sorry. I'm getting the jellies and you're doing what again?"
"228103012-0-54786";"Hold on. I might have something to treat your injury."
"228103012-0-54791";"Where can I find the swamp jellies?"
"228103012-0-54792";"Will there be more Blackguards waiting for me at this hideout?"
"228103012-0-54797";"Is there anything I can do for you?"
"228103012-0-54801";"I found this grave-stake at a nearby camp. Is it the one you're looking for?"
"228103012-0-54804";"You think you can really fix this?"
"228103012-0-54805";"Why are you asking me to destroy your artwork?"
"228103012-0-54808";"It was certainly unexpected."
"228103012-0-54816";"What exactly is a grave-stake?"
"228103012-0-54817";"Why do you want me to recover the grave-stakes?"
"228103012-0-54819";"Tell me about Tun-Zee."
"228103012-0-54823";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-54825";"You don't sound like the other Argonians I've spoken to here in Murkmire."
"228103012-0-54826";"I found the Skin Taker. She won't trouble anyone again."
"228103012-0-54829";"I found the Skin Taker. She won't hurt anyone again."
"228103012-0-54835";"Why do you want me to recover the grave stakes?"
"228103012-0-54836";"Why do you want me to recover the grave stakes?"
"228103012-0-54841";"I need to find Beehuna's dowry for the bonding ritual."
"228103012-0-54845";"Where do you think I should start my search?"
"228103012-0-54847";"Explain to me how I'm supposed to find the dowry again."
"228103012-0-54848";"Who's Naheesh Oleen?"
"228103012-0-54855";"Do you have any thoughts about the missing eggs?"
"228103012-0-54856";"I found these herbs mixed in with the apples over there. Is that normal?"
"228103012-0-54858";"I found this plant mixed in with the fruit. Is it supposed to be there?"
"228103012-0-54860";"Why are you helping us?"
"228103012-0-54863";"Why can't you sneak into the depot with me? You just pick-pocketed that Orc."
"228103012-0-54865";"Nothing out of the ordinary other than these herbs. I found them buried in a fruit basket."
"228103012-0-54866";"Will this save the Dead-Water tribe?"
"228103012-0-54869";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-54870";"The northern section of the village is in ruins?"
"228103012-0-54873";"Why is the northern part of your town in ruins?"
"228103012-0-54900";"You never suspected Ree-Nakal had bad intentions?"
"228103012-0-54908";"Who is this Tsojei person you keep talking about?"
"228103012-0-54911";"What can you tell me about this aloe?"
"228103012-0-54912";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-54914";"I need to know who I'm fighting with. Who are you, really?"
"228103012-0-54917";"Can you tell me more about the kidnappers? The Blackguards?"
"228103012-0-54918";"Why are you so intent on finding a renewal charm?"
"228103012-0-54924";"Lady Laurent demands recompense. The information you provided didn't lead to a renewal charm."
"228103012-0-54928";"What's an ojel and why are you so hostile?"
"228103012-0-54929";"Why do you have such a problem with outsiders?"
"228103012-0-54933";"Can you tell me anything about mushrooms?"
"228103012-0-54934";"No questions from me. Let's start the raid."
"228103012-0-54940";"Here's the key. What about the charm?"
"228103012-0-54942";"You want me to save Kishi and then send him away?"
"228103012-0-54951";"Do you know anything about this xanmeer we're entering?"
"228103012-0-54952";"There must be a way for Lady Laurent and Stibbons to observe your renewal rite."
"228103012-0-54956";"What can you tell me about your tribe?"
"228103012-0-54957";"How long do you think you need to stay under there?"
"228103012-0-54961";"I've cleared a path. Head back to Root-Whisper."
"228103012-0-54962";"I've cleared the way. Head back to Root-Whisper."
"228103012-0-54963";"What more can you tell me about the envoys?"
"228103012-0-54968";"Tell me more about these offerings."
"228103012-0-54976";"Why do you need hackwing leather? Why not choose a safer animal to hunt?"
"228103012-0-54977";"I don't understand what the frogs have to do with a musical instrument."
"228103012-0-54980";"Where do I find the frogs you need?"
"228103012-0-54987";"What is this bonding ritual everyone is so occupied with?"
"228103012-0-54988";"I just need some branches for a ritual."
"228103012-0-54993";"Next season? That seems a little fast."
"228103012-0-54999";"What's the ritual of renewal?"
"228103012-0-55000";"What's Stibbons doing in the mud again?"
"228103012-0-55001";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-55002";"You don't trust Many-Whispers?"
"228103012-0-55003";"How did you get past all the monsters?"
"228103012-0-55005";"Tell me more about Many-Whispers."
"228103012-0-55007";"What's so special about a renewal charm?"
"228103012-0-55008";"Why are you down in this cavern full of undead creatures?"
"228103012-0-55009";"Can you tell me more about the ritual of renewal?"
"228103012-0-55011";"Can you tell me about the preparations again?"
"228103012-0-55015";"Are you sure you want to go through with this?"
"228103012-0-55018";"Why not just attend the ritual yourself?"
"228103012-0-55022";"Why entrust me with this task?"
"228103012-0-55023";"Is that egg really Stibbons?"
"228103012-0-55026";"What is the bonding ritual?"
"228103012-0-55028";"If your eggs are in danger, why not cancel your ceremony?"
"228103012-0-55029";"What do you expect me to find?"
"228103012-0-55031";"Do all the Murkmire tribes participate in your bonding ritual?"
"228103012-0-55032";"What troubles the Bright-Throat tribe?"
"228103012-0-55039";"Voh-Vastei?"
"228103012-0-55041";"I witnessed some of your argument earlier. Why were things so heated?"
"228103012-0-55056";"Who is Mewah-Jez?"
"228103012-0-55057";"The Bright-Throats are known for their egg tending."
"228103012-0-55070";"Who is Mewah-Jez?"
"228103012-0-55079";"Anything special about this hunting bow?"
"228103012-0-55080";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"228103012-0-55088";"Have you done a vision quest?"
"228103012-0-55094";"Do you know anything about the Remnant of Argon?"
"228103012-0-55106";"Tell me about your role as nisswo."
"228103012-0-55120";"I found some of Ree-Nakal's writings. She's been experimenting on these eggs."
"228103012-0-55122";"I need to ask your Hist about the Remnant of Argon."
"228103012-0-55126";"Was taking the eggs really necessary?"
"228103012-0-55129";"No. It seems fine. What happens now?"
"228103012-0-55132";"Can you tell me more about why that tree grew?"
"228103012-0-55135";"Why come to me for this? Don't the tribes have ways of dealing with this kind of crime?"
"228103012-0-55137";"We believe so. We should know for sure soon."
"228103012-0-55138";"Why was Bhoki stripped of his title as trainer?"
"228103012-0-55144";"They'll need to be careful. Kassandra made her own allies—the Blackguards."
"228103012-0-55150";"We learned a riddle about the Remnant of Argon. What happened here?"
"228103012-0-55158";"One of them talks about Blackguards searching for relics Argonians use to communicate with the Hist."
"228103012-0-55163";"Why are you doing this? I thought you hated what Bhogyi did?"
"228103012-0-55164";"Will you be all right now?"
"228103012-0-55167";"What can you tell me about Sulosya?"
"228103012-0-55170";"You're mad at me for saving you?"
"228103012-0-55171";"Things weren't so hopeless as you thought."
"228103012-0-55172";"She refuses to speak to you?"
"228103012-0-55174";"You want to go back to the Teeth?"
"228103012-0-55175";"Now that Shuxaltsei is dead, what will you do?"
"228103012-0-55183";"You mentioned Naga. What are they?"
"228103012-0-55184";"Tell me more about this Remnant of Argon."
"228103012-0-55185";"The murders are what I'm here to discuss. Milzus said you know where the bodies were found?"
"228103012-0-55190";"The sap-speaker needs your help. I was sent to fetch you."
"228103012-0-55193";"I was told you're a hunter. What do you make of the skinned bodies you found?"
"228103012-0-55194";"Why use me as an envoy? Why not contact Captain Jimila directly?"
"228103012-0-55196";"She didn't make it."
"228103012-0-55202";"I worked with Captain Jimila in the past."
"228103012-0-55203";"Having trouble?"
"228103012-0-55204";"I'm here on behalf of Nesh-Deeka to offer you a deal."
"228103012-0-55210";"What happened between you and the Dragonstar Caravan Company, exactly?"
"228103012-0-55219";"How are you recovering?"
"228103012-0-55221";"Who was the victim you found?"
"228103012-0-55222";"If the Skin Taker is a Blackguard, she might not be working alone."
"228103012-0-55227";"What brings you to Murkmire, Lady Laurent?"
"228103012-0-55228";"What are you waiting for?"
"228103012-0-55233";"Julitta? Is that the name of the Skinner?"
"228103012-0-55234";"I've heard that name before. I spared Hostia when Jaxsik wanted to murder her."
"228103012-0-55236";"Why are the Naga-Kur so unfriendly to outsiders?"
"228103012-0-55239";"Did you know Julitta's mother?"
"228103012-0-55240";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-55242";"Why would Hostia do this after we spared her life?"
"228103012-0-55243";"Do you ferry travelers?"
"228103012-0-55244";"You don't trust Many-Whispers?"
"228103012-0-55248";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-55250";"A Root-House lizard …?"
"228103012-0-55253";"What's this argument about?"
"228103012-0-55255";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-55256";"Did you steal this man's coin purse?"
"228103012-0-55263";"You knew about this village?"
"228103012-0-55266";"And how were you swindled?"
"228103012-0-55267";"Because I chose to exile you?"
"228103012-0-55268";"I see your interests haven't changed much."
"228103012-0-55276";"How are you, Nisswo?"
"228103012-0-55279";"A ku-vastei?"
"228103012-0-55284";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-55287";"Do you know the flavor of fear?"
"228103012-0-55295";"Teeba-hatsei?"
"228103012-0-55298";"What's the problem?"
"228103012-0-55299";"What offerings?"
"228103012-0-55308";"How goes recruitment?"
"228103012-0-55309";"How goes the war effort?"
"228103012-0-55310";"I'll go wherever I like, Pact scum."
"228103012-0-55311";"Why do you care?"
"228103012-0-55314";"Excuse me?"
"228103012-0-55317";"Did Stibbons really transform into an egg?"
"228103012-0-55320";"This is goodbye then."
"228103012-0-55322";"So you've known Xukas for a long time?"
"228103012-0-55330";"Why won't she let you light the fire?"
"228103012-0-55334";"Is that why your fire is out?"
"228103012-0-55337";"You seem pretty excited about this relic business."
"228103012-0-55347";"What are grave-stakes?"
"228103012-0-55354";"Do you have any idea where Ree-Nakal might be keeping your children?"
"228103012-0-55357";"What were you using the dragonthorn for?"
"228103012-0-55361";"Her notes mentioned other matured hatchlings being being sequestered. I don't think these are them."
"228103012-0-55364";"What happened to Stibbons?"
"228103012-0-55366";"You think they'll accept her?"
"228103012-0-55368";"I'll escort you back to the village."
"228103012-0-55369";"What did you mean when you said you didn't know what the Hist's relief meant for Haxara's daughter?"
"228103012-0-55378";"Rootmender?"
"228103012-0-55383";"What are you and Varona doing here in Murkmire?"
"228103012-0-55384";"What are you and Varona doing here in Murkmire?"
"228103012-0-55385";"What are you and Varona doing here in Murkmire?"
"228103012-0-55386";"If you have to choose between her and your tribe, you'll always pick her. That's why you must leave."
"228103012-0-55389";"What will the two of you do now?"
"228103012-0-55390";"What is this game?"
"228103012-0-55397";"I'm not a member of the Blackguards."
"228103012-0-55400";"Just traveling. What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-55406";"Is that a ship above us?"
"228103012-0-55408";"Why is there a boat in a tree?"
"228103012-0-55409";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-55410";"You're studying this wreck?"
"228103012-0-55413";"Why the concern?"
"228103012-0-55416";"I lost the trail. Can you help me look for it?"
"228103012-0-55421";"I'd like to leave Murkmire."
"228103012-0-55422";"Grahtwood, please."
"228103012-0-55423";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-55424";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-55425";"Yes. I'd like to go to Murkmire."
"228103012-0-55427";"Do all the Murkmire tribes participate in your Bonding Ritual?"
"228103012-0-55429";"Why choose someone in Ruxol's condition to be your tribe's suitor?"
"228103012-0-55431";"Do you always have to steal things?"
"228103012-0-55433";"Are there always so many?"
"228103012-0-55434";"You know how to perform the binding ritual?"
"228103012-0-55436";"I think you made the right choice."
"228103012-0-55437";"<Remain silent.>"
"228103012-0-55438";"Why did you become an arbitrator?"
"228103012-0-55443";"I've never seen a swamp jelly before. What are they?"
"228103012-0-55445";"<Remain silent.>"
"228103012-0-55456";"You're implying I shouldn't be here?"
"228103012-0-55457";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"228103012-0-55458";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"228103012-0-55459";"What will happen if Kassandra gets to the Remnant first?"
"228103012-0-55464";"Do Shadowscales not welcome the Brotherhood?"
"228103012-0-55465";"Do Shadowscales not welcome the Brotherhood?"
"228103012-0-55469";"What can you tell me about the Blackguards?"
"228103012-0-55476";"Leave the waking world? Does that mean one of them will die?"
"228103012-0-55478";"Couldn't I guide the tribe? Why does it need to be Xukas or Jaxsik-Orrn?"
"228103012-0-55479";"We met before—in the dream-wallow, right?"
"228103012-0-55480";"Actually, we never got properly introduced."
"228103012-0-55481";"Is Haxara usually this emotional?"
"228103012-0-55483";"I saw the note. What exactly are these Death-Hunts?"
"228103012-0-55494";"I don't know what you're talking about."
"228103012-0-55497";"Your Hist looks old and barren. Will releasing you from the Remnant bring it back to life?"
"228103012-0-55498";"What is shunatei?"
"228103012-0-55500";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-55503";"What's your next move?"
"228103012-0-55506";"What's wrong with the Imperials?"
"228103012-0-55507";"I gathered all the frogs except for the sun-blessed toads."
"228103012-0-55511";"I'd like to know who I'll be working with."
"228103012-0-55512";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-55513";"What about Dead-Water? Will you leave your village?"
"228103012-0-55514";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-55516";"Who were you talking to when I arrived?"
"228103012-0-55524";"What do you plan to do with this Remnant of Argon if we find it?"
"228103012-0-55528";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-55534";"What do you know about this Vakka-Bok Xanmeer?"
"228103012-0-55537";"If Kassandra doesn't stop, we might have to fight her. Are you prepared for that?"
"228103012-0-55540";"We found one vakka stone. We can find another."
"228103012-0-55541";"I'm going after them."
"228103012-0-55552";"How do you know?"
"228103012-0-55556";"I am a little suprised to see you in the nesting area. Given what happened."
"228103012-0-55576";"What are you doing here, Jee-Lar?"
"228103012-0-55602";"Euraxia's final order, she sent an assassination squad to kill the last Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-55603";"Do you think the Imperials have any chance of actually regrouping after this?"
"228103012-0-55604";"So what was Euraxia's final order?"
"228103012-0-55606";"Khamira thinks you might know where Euraxia sent her last orders to the Imperials."
"228103012-0-55607";"Khamira thinks you might know where Euraxia sent her last orders to the Imperials."
"228103012-0-55609";"Tharn said to report to you for my orders."
"228103012-0-55611";"Do you know anything about Captain Saulinia or Prefect Calo?"
"228103012-0-55613";"Where were you returning from, Zamarak?"
"228103012-0-55615";"Zamarak and I came to warn you. The Euraxians are about to attack. You need to get into the town."
"228103012-0-55618";"I'm not one of Euraxia's soldiers. Tsazii sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-55621";"You can grieve later. Right now you have to take your family and get inside the town."
"228103012-0-55624";"All right. What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-55626";"You had another one of your dream-visions? What did you see?"
"228103012-0-55628";"Wait. You didn't know you could make traps?"
"228103012-0-55632";"You think we'll have to fight our way in?"
"228103012-0-55636";"What situation are we talking about?"
"228103012-0-55638";"Triangulants? Is that a real word?"
"228103012-0-55642";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"228103012-0-55643";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"228103012-0-55644";"What kind of weapon is powerful enough to stop the war?"
"228103012-0-55646";"Are you going to help me gather the mushrooms?"
"228103012-0-55649";"Dagaril-dro sent me. I need to learn the story of Khunzar-ri and the demon."
"228103012-0-55653";"Cadwell had another vision. He saw the necromancer Zumog Phoom approaching Riverhold."
"228103012-0-55656";"The first triangulant?"
"228103012-0-55663";"How do you know who I am?"
"228103012-0-55664";"I'm here to find out what Euraxia asked you to do with her final order."
"228103012-0-55665";"I'm here to find out what Euraxia asked you to do with her final order."
"228103012-0-55673";"So you figured out where the next triangulant for the map can be found?"
"228103012-0-55676";"Dagaril-dro sent me. I need to learn the story of Khunzar-ri and the demon."
"228103012-0-55681";"Cadwell, what did you see?"
"228103012-0-55685";"It's me, Cadwell. What are you seeing?"
"228103012-0-55688";"Euraxia's final order was to eliminate the last Dragonguard. The Dragons deemed them a threat."
"228103012-0-55689";"Euraxia's last command was to eliminate a group known as the Dragonguard. She deemed them a threat."
"228103012-0-55692";"Dagaril-dro sent me. I need to learn the story of Khunzar-ri and the demon."
"228103012-0-55696";"You know where the final triangulant is located?"
"228103012-0-55700";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-55701";"Are you and Hadaz miners?"
"228103012-0-55702";"There are still a lot of cultists down there. Do you think you'll be able to clear them out?"
"228103012-0-55707";"You're the one that's been following him, aren't you?"
"228103012-0-55710";"Who's the Speaker of the Mane?"
"228103012-0-55711";"Saulinia has orders to kill someone they believe is the last Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-55714";"Are you really the queen of Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-55725";"Why not talk to Abnur Tharn directly about destroying the weapon?"
"228103012-0-55727";"How are you able to avoid Abnur Tharn's detection?"
"228103012-0-55729";"I met your shadow on the way here. Her name is Khamira. She's an agent of the Speaker of the Mane."
"228103012-0-55732";"If finding the weapon gives us a chance to stop the Three Banners War, it's worth the risk."
"228103012-0-55734";"If the weapon is as dangerous as Khamira says, maybe we should destroy it."
"228103012-0-55736";"I heard there's a problem with the adeptorium's water supply."
"228103012-0-55737";"Shouldn't we try to open this door?"
"228103012-0-55741";"What's the Baan Dar Span?"
"228103012-0-55744";"Who would wear a habit like that?"
"228103012-0-55747";"Silhu-jo? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-55750";"What is it?"
"228103012-0-55753";"The Halls of Colossus?"
"228103012-0-55756";"He did it to save you."
"228103012-0-55760";"Dragons have returned. Euraxia sent the assassin because she thought you knew how to stop them."
"228103012-0-55761";"I'm sorry."
"228103012-0-55765";"Slow down. Took who? What happened?"
"228103012-0-55766";"We came here to try and stop the dragoons before they found you all."
"228103012-0-55767";"We came here to try and stop the dragoons before they found you all."
"228103012-0-55780";"I gathered the samples. Where's Najirra going?"
"228103012-0-55782";"How does the whistle work, exactly?"
"228103012-0-55791";"So, what's your idea for getting us into the palace without alerting Euraxia's guards?"
"228103012-0-55792";"Permanently? You want us to kill your own sister?"
"228103012-0-55805";"Iokkas sent me. I have an antidote that will help."
"228103012-0-55816";"What do you mean? Why does Zumog Phoom need Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-55819";"And then what?"
"228103012-0-55836";"How long do you think it will take for the Prowl to recover?"
"228103012-0-55837";"She's Queen Khamira now, and she remembers you, too. We need your help."
"228103012-0-55841";"The old castellan suggests we enter through the crypts. He gave me the master key."
"228103012-0-55849";"What are you seeing this time?"
"228103012-0-55850";"What are you seeing this time?"
"228103012-0-55855";"Is it really a good idea to split up our party?"
"228103012-0-55859";"Why would Euraxia dig up the royal family?"
"228103012-0-55864";"Can you tell me more about the town of Hakoshae?"
"228103012-0-55866";"Cadwell, tell me what happened."
"228103012-0-55867";"What's happening Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-55868";"What's happening Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-55871";"A festival?"
"228103012-0-55872";"How'd the Daedra get here if it wasn't summoned?"
"228103012-0-55873";"What were they doing to you, Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-55877";"Tell me more about your town."
"228103012-0-55881";"The magnate has allowed me to join the festival, and said I should speak to you."
"228103012-0-55884";"What did Captain Calsivius mean when he said that you broke the seal?"
"228103012-0-55887";"How did you know that panel would stop the flow of poison gas?"
"228103012-0-55890";"Khamira, those were your parents. And Captain Nala-do died defending you. Are you sure …."
"228103012-0-55893";"Why are you here, Nala-do?"
"228103012-0-55894";"I'm here to complete the Proof of Strength. The magnate gave me permission."
"228103012-0-55895";"How are you and these other spirits here?"
"228103012-0-55897";"How are you and these other spirits here?"
"228103012-0-55905";"I found the flower. Here you go."
"228103012-0-55907";"Cadwell? What's wrong with you?"
"228103012-0-55915";"What's happening to you?"
"228103012-0-55921";"I have, and was told to speak to you."
"228103012-0-55923";"Cadwell … faded away. We stopped Zumog Phoom, but not before he reanimated the Betrayer."
"228103012-0-55924";"Cadwell's old body was resurrected, but our Cadwell was lost in the process."
"228103012-0-55928";"What was the riddle again?"
"228103012-0-55929";"A bowl."
"228103012-0-55932";"A candle."
"228103012-0-55933";"A potion."
"228103012-0-55941";"Her family has led Hakoshae since its founding. She's well-respected and scholarly. Does that help?"
"228103012-0-55946";"I'm the traveler who completed the Proving Festival."
"228103012-0-55947";"The location indicated on the map, what is that place?"
"228103012-0-55948";"What do you think it all means?"
"228103012-0-55949";"What do you think it all means?"
"228103012-0-55950";"Cadwell said your pendant was the key."
"228103012-0-55951";"How do we get inside?"
"228103012-0-55958";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-55959";"Whose daughter is missing?"
"228103012-0-55998";"Tell me everything the attuned memories have shown you."
"228103012-0-55999";"What's the job?"
"228103012-0-56002";"This power they spoke of. Do we know what it is?"
"228103012-0-56008";"Why would a spirit abduct the magnate?"
"228103012-0-56009";"Tasnasi sent me to recruit you for a job."
"228103012-0-56010";"What do you think Captain Calsivius was trying to do?"
"228103012-0-56014";"Isn't the return of the Dragons kind of a big deal?"
"228103012-0-56021";"You can't stop the eclipse?"
"228103012-0-56022";"Are you working under the orders of the Morag Tong?"
"228103012-0-56023";"What gate do you speak of?"
"228103012-0-56025";"What gate do you speak of?"
"228103012-0-56026";"Where is Quintus?"
"228103012-0-56028";"Are you worried about Quintus coming after you again?"
"228103012-0-56030";"Tasnasi wants you to join her crew."
"228103012-0-56032";"Can you make out what's on the complete tablet?"
"228103012-0-56033";"Why do you crave revenge?"
"228103012-0-56035";"Do you think you can find the missing piece?"
"228103012-0-56039";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-56047";"I'm here for the focus Sereyne pawned to you."
"228103012-0-56048";"I'm actually investigating the abduction of Ishu's daughter."
"228103012-0-56052";"That seems to be the case. Will you speak the truth?"
"228103012-0-56056";"I'm here for the focus Sereyne pawned to you."
"228103012-0-56061";"I've got your lute."
"228103012-0-56062";"I got your focus back."
"228103012-0-56065";"He told me to seek out a Wood Elf who stays up late at night. She may have seen something."
"228103012-0-56067";"Tasnasi has a job. She wants you to join her crew."
"228103012-0-56071";"He was headed back to the Temple, last I saw him."
"228103012-0-56074";"Tell me more about Tajirri."
"228103012-0-56083";"Yes, I'm looking for a hat stolen from a shrine?"
"228103012-0-56089";"I found this hidden note. I suspect the gambler Tajirri wrote it."
"228103012-0-56092";"Why are Akaviri relics in a Khajiiti tomb?"
"228103012-0-56099";"You and Khasda obviously have history. What went down between you two?"
"228103012-0-56105";"You're suggesting they made some sort of Daedric pact?"
"228103012-0-56107";"Why are you doing this?"
"228103012-0-56109";"They aren't your visions. The Skooma Cat is playing tricks on you."
"228103012-0-56113";"I think I'm fine."
"228103012-0-56116";"What would smugglers want with Ishu?"
"228103012-0-56119";"Is that a threat?"
"228103012-0-56122";"What's changing?"
"228103012-0-56123";"I already knew you were the Skooma Cat. I thought you said you'd let Sizenza go if I took her place."
"228103012-0-56131";"Before we do that, a stranger spoke to me. She said Ishu's daughter left town years ago."
"228103012-0-56136";"I found another note. This one has a poem written on it."
"228103012-0-56141";"I have a few questions, if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-56147";"Not before we find Ishu's daughter."
"228103012-0-56150";"Who are you, anyway?"
"228103012-0-56151";"Tell me about these hunters I'm hunting."
"228103012-0-56152";"Rideza the Rogue?"
"228103012-0-56156";"I have more questions about this monster."
"228103012-0-56159";"Is there a problem?"
"228103012-0-56162";"So Rideza was Ishu's daughter, and she … stole his cat?"
"228103012-0-56174";"I couldn't help but notice your fine Khajiiti food."
"228103012-0-56180";"Rakhzargo mentioned that some farmhands have gone missing."
"228103012-0-56183";"So, this was all just part of the show?"
"228103012-0-56185";"Does that mean you can clear your name and return home?"
"228103012-0-56196";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-56197";"How did you end up in these caverns in the first place?"
"228103012-0-56198";"Where can I find concentrations of Daedra?"
"228103012-0-56203";"Yushiha told me how you're driving her clan to violence."
"228103012-0-56209";"Khamira wants us to gather at the Moon Gate of Anequina."
"228103012-0-56211";"Tell me about being an investigator."
"228103012-0-56213";"Khamira wants us to gather at the Moon Gate of Anequina."
"228103012-0-56216";"Same here. Shouldn't there be more people?"
"228103012-0-56217";"How did the Euraxians get inside the town so fast?"
"228103012-0-56221";"Khamira wants us to gather at the Moon Gate of Anequina."
"228103012-0-56222";"Khamira has agreed to your terms, but she needs your troops at the Moon Gate."
"228103012-0-56224";"Are we ready for this?"
"228103012-0-56232";"What do you mean, Zamarak?"
"228103012-0-56233";"You used to be an honor guard to Khamira's parents, right?"
"228103012-0-56236";"Who is this Caldathir, exactly?"
"228103012-0-56237";"Why do you want this Marzula-jo's notes?"
"228103012-0-56238";"Did you not hear me before? Marzula-jo's spells had terrible consequences."
"228103012-0-56242";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-56243";"Are you able to portal us down to the core?"
"228103012-0-56249";"How's that?"
"228103012-0-56254";"When did your Moon-Bishop start having visions?"
"228103012-0-56262";"Where will you go now?"
"228103012-0-56270";"How did you finally figure out how to move the moons, Khamira?"
"228103012-0-56272";"We did it together."
"228103012-0-56279";"Does necromantic energy always affect you this way?"
"228103012-0-56305";"Phylactery?"
"228103012-0-56311";"What have you done with the Moon-Bishop?"
"228103012-0-56318";"I'm ready to demonstrate my fighting skills."
"228103012-0-56319";"Slow down. Arum-Khal? Who is that?"
"228103012-0-56323";"Having second thoughts on becoming Queen of Anequina?"
"228103012-0-56325";"I don't know what to say."
"228103012-0-56328";"As a matter of fact, I brought the dusk mushrooms just for you."
"228103012-0-56332";"Yes. He said we need to go to the Redfur Trading Post, the Baandari Trading Post, and Rawl'kha."
"228103012-0-56339";"Sizenza, it's not real. This isn't your temple."
"228103012-0-56345";"You're making an anchor?"
"228103012-0-56351";"Vastarie and I are trying to stop Arum-Khal. We need information."
"228103012-0-56355";"Remind me. Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-56356";"I'm not a poacher. What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-56357";"What went wrong?"
"228103012-0-56361";"Remind me. Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-56365";"What's the job?"
"228103012-0-56371";"Your mother wants you to help me find some missing farmhands."
"228103012-0-56372";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-56377";"Guards? For a moon-sugar farm?"
"228103012-0-56380";"This Moonlight Blade, right? What is it?"
"228103012-0-56385";"And what do you think that problem is?"
"228103012-0-56386";"It sounded more like she was another servant. She claimed they hid the Wrathstone for her."
"228103012-0-56390";"What kind of monster did you see?"
"228103012-0-56393";"When I entered this cave, I saw a mage speak to the daedroth through a projection."
"228103012-0-56398";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-56402";"Any idea of who might be behind this?"
"228103012-0-56403";"Sheogorath's hold on the temple should be gone now."
"228103012-0-56406";"Seems the moon-sugar thieves don't mind the threat of cave-ins."
"228103012-0-56409";"Who are you? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-56415";"Together? I thought I only needed this weapon."
"228103012-0-56425";"Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-56428";"What did you do with Euraxia's hand-maiden?"
"228103012-0-56434";"Vastarie said if we destroy undead with the sword near at hand, it will gradually strengthen itself."
"228103012-0-56437";"No. Queen Khamira sent me. You're safe now."
"228103012-0-56438";"I'm just here to try and talk to the General, that's all."
"228103012-0-56443";"Vastarie says the door is locked."
"228103012-0-56447";"You must have some idea where this hidden Akaviri shrine is located."
"228103012-0-56448";"I have some questions for you."
"228103012-0-56461";"What's wrong with Erilthel?"
"228103012-0-56478";"I thought he was beyond redemption."
"228103012-0-56480";"Is there no way to save him? He said the realm was collapsing."
"228103012-0-56483";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-56489";"Has the aqueduct ever gone dry before?"
"228103012-0-56496";"What can you tell me about S'rendarr's Cradle?"
"228103012-0-56499";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-56502";"That Akaviri spirit seemed to recognize you. Any idea why?"
"228103012-0-56503";"Why give the killer a moniker like Skin Taker?"
"228103012-0-56505";"Why give the killer a moniker like Skin Taker?"
"228103012-0-56507";"Saulinia has orders to kill someone they believe is the last Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-56512";"Why are you worried about Vazbi trying to restore the water?"
"228103012-0-56514";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-56516";"Is that what you and the magnate were talking about?"
"228103012-0-56517";"You seem to know a lot about aqueducts."
"228103012-0-56519";"Where can I find the second gate?"
"228103012-0-56522";"I want to know more about our client, Ishu."
"228103012-0-56528";"Is there something out here that the Euraxians want?"
"228103012-0-56534";"With King Narilmor dead, we should be free to leave Garlas Malatar, correct?"
"228103012-0-56539";"What's next for you, Thunderboots?"
"228103012-0-56548";"Do you know what the war council is meeting about?"
"228103012-0-56549";"Yes, you seemed to recognize all those items. What haven't you told me?"
"228103012-0-56554";"You mentioned a Dragon attack?"
"228103012-0-56555";"Can you tell me more about your ranch?"
"228103012-0-56556";"Is this whistle you want me to recover unique?"
"228103012-0-56557";"It's a big canyon. How are we going to find whoever it is we're looking for?"
"228103012-0-56560";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56561";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56562";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56563";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56564";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56565";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56568";"Remind me about this weapon you're looking for."
"228103012-0-56572";"Is what Khamira said true? Is she really the heir to the throne of Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-56575";"Do these surges of energy have something to do with the Dragons?"
"228103012-0-56579";"Is that gravestone important?"
"228103012-0-56580";"Are you all right? You don't look so good."
"228103012-0-56588";"Why do you think you dreamed about this gravestone?"
"228103012-0-56591";"You defeated a Dragon!"
"228103012-0-56593";"What can I do to help?"
"228103012-0-56597";"I'm <<1>>. Khamira asked me to recover these documents and give them to you."
"228103012-0-56601";"I found the documents and gave them to Nala-do. She went to Riverhold to confer with Gharesh-ri."
"228103012-0-56605";"Neither. Abnur Tharn sent me to find the source of the undead that attacked the outpost."
"228103012-0-56606";"You decimated the Khajiiti Defense Force and now you expect me to talk to you?"
"228103012-0-56612";"Khamira, what happened after you leaped off the cliff?"
"228103012-0-56615";"Khamira and I killed the necromancers in the mountain, but Euraxia has an army of them."
"228103012-0-56620";"What's your plan for saving Vazbi?"
"228103012-0-56621";"Can you tell me anything about the people that kidnapped Vazbi?"
"228103012-0-56622";"The Stricken came to S'rendarr's Cradle for healing?"
"228103012-0-56625";"We need to talk about the Stricken."
"228103012-0-56644";"I just got back, Cadwell. Tell me what's wrong."
"228103012-0-56650";"Salvation?"
"228103012-0-56654";"I didn't feed on your sister, but she did tell me how you're driving her clan to violence."
"228103012-0-56658";"There was a letter from Abnur Tharn. Do you know anything about it?"
"228103012-0-56660";"I'm just here to try and talk to the General, that's all."
"228103012-0-56666";"I'm just here to try and talk to the General, that's all."
"228103012-0-56667";"Is he alive?"
"228103012-0-56678";"Do you have any other plans?"
"228103012-0-56681";"Where will you go?"
"228103012-0-56689";"Tell me more about the Proof of Reverence."
"228103012-0-56690";"Tell me about Captain Saulinia."
"228103012-0-56692";"If you had people on the inside, why not escape earlier?"
"228103012-0-56693";"What can you tell me about the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-56697";"Yes. Take a look."
"228103012-0-56701";"If your clan has always been peaceful, why does Rakazsa want them to attack travelers?"
"228103012-0-56702";"All right, show me how Euraxia keeps the Khajiit in line."
"228103012-0-56703";"Let's skip the tour and get on with the parley."
"228103012-0-56705";"Tell me more about the Proof of Strength."
"228103012-0-56708";"Won't that also alert Euraxia to our presence?"
"228103012-0-56711";"Zamarak, you keep starting to tell me something but you never finish. Tell me what you want to say."
"228103012-0-56714";"Tell me about the Proof of Wisdom."
"228103012-0-56715";"Are you sure? Rimmen looks peaceful to me."
"228103012-0-56717";"The workhouse accepts only Khajiiti workers?"
"228103012-0-56721";"You're saying the Khajiiti merchants are treated unfairly?"
"228103012-0-56724";"What do you mean, her success?"
"228103012-0-56728";"You're one of Euraxia's necromancers?"
"228103012-0-56732";"You didn't have any difficulty getting here?"
"228103012-0-56737";"Vazbi? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-56739";"Can you tell me anything that will help?"
"228103012-0-56740";"What do you know about the Abode of Ignominy?"
"228103012-0-56741";"What can you tell me about the missing farmhands?"
"228103012-0-56743";"Can you tell me more about your farm?"
"228103012-0-56748";"You want me to take your eldest son along on my investigation?"
"228103012-0-56750";"Tell me more about this rival farmer, M'zum."
"228103012-0-56751";"We came to warn you. The Dragons consider you a puppet and they plan to betray you."
"228103012-0-56760";"Do you know why the adeptorium is under attack?"
"228103012-0-56764";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-56765";"Tell me more about Dragonhorn Tower."
"228103012-0-56767";"What are you doing here, Raz?"
"228103012-0-56771";"Where is M'zum's Fragrant Moons Plantation?"
"228103012-0-56772";"You don't seem to get along with your family very well."
"228103012-0-56773";"Where are we and how did we get here?"
"228103012-0-56779";"We failed. The parley was a disaster."
"228103012-0-56784";"Anything I should keep in mind while we're inside the plantation grounds?"
"228103012-0-56785";"Who are the Redhands?"
"228103012-0-56786";"I work with Gharesh-ri. I heard about the attack on the adeptorium and came to help."
"228103012-0-56788";"What can you tell me about the ossuary?"
"228103012-0-56789";"What do you make of this journal we found?"
"228103012-0-56790";"This claw I found is strange. Any idea what creature it might have come from?"
"228103012-0-56791";"M'zum's workers seem scared of some sort of beast."
"228103012-0-56794";"Zumog Phoom? What's happening to you?"
"228103012-0-56800";"What exactly do you do here?"
"228103012-0-56801";"What should I look for at Honey-Breeze Homestead?"
"228103012-0-56804";"One of Euraxia's battlemages. I killed her, but I was too late to save the Grand Adept."
"228103012-0-56806";"We have a lead, but first we need to visit Honey-Breeze Homestead."
"228103012-0-56810";"The Euraxians attacked the Desert Wind Adeptorium, killed the Grand Adept, and stole information."
"228103012-0-56814";"Slow down. What's attacking the farm?"
"228103012-0-56822";"Your father is safe farther down the hill. I cleared the path. You should go to him."
"228103012-0-56828";"Who were you talking to when I arrived?"
"228103012-0-56829";"Your father is safe farther down the hill, and I cleared the path. You should go to him."
"228103012-0-56830";"Your father is safe farther down the hill. I cleared the path. You should go to him."
"228103012-0-56847";"What should I search for in your mother's cellar?"
"228103012-0-56849";"Tell me more about your father."
"228103012-0-56850";"We believe you may be missing moon-sugar."
"228103012-0-56860";"How have things been, Ashur?"
"228103012-0-56863";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-56870";"I recovered one piece of the mural. Rajhin's Shadow stole them."
"228103012-0-56873";"Tell me about the Morag Tong."
"228103012-0-56874";"You seem eager to leave."
"228103012-0-56879";"Yes, I saw your job posting. What kind of work are you offering?"
"228103012-0-56884";"Can you tell me more about the people I'm recruiting?"
"228103012-0-56888";"Who are the Hollowfang clan?"
"228103012-0-56889";"[Launch the Hemo Helot at Grundwulf]"
"228103012-0-56890";"I destroyed the Hollowfang clan and defeated the Dragonguard vampire, Grundwulf."
"228103012-0-56892";"Dragon blight?"
"228103012-0-56893";"<Try to smash the seed.>"
"228103012-0-56894";"I put an end to Maarselok's corruption with the help of the Changeling, Selene."
"228103012-0-56908";"Can you tell me more about your faith?"
"228103012-0-56909";"Natrada told me I could see Alkosh here."
"228103012-0-56910";"Tell me about Sunspire."
"228103012-0-56911";"How long have you served at the temple?"
"228103012-0-56912";"What can you tell me about Azin-jo?"
"228103012-0-56926";"Isn't it odd that the thief left a clue?"
"228103012-0-56927";"Tell me more about the mural you were restoring."
"228103012-0-56931";"Why are the cultists at war?"
"228103012-0-56932";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-56939";"Yes. They're both safe."
"228103012-0-56942";"Yes. They're both safe."
"228103012-0-56945";"Yes. They're both safe."
"228103012-0-56949";"No more games. If you stole the crystal, give it back."
"228103012-0-56952";"I have the blossom, but I spotted a Nereid in the glade. She demanded I leave."
"228103012-0-56967";"Can you tell me anything about the Betrayer?"
"228103012-0-56973";"What about you, Zamarak? What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-56976";"Isn't this your family tomb?"
"228103012-0-56977";"How did you die?"
"228103012-0-56978";"I thought Jone and Jode were guiding us?"
"228103012-0-56981";"Is this a royal tomb?"
"228103012-0-56983";"What was stolen?"
"228103012-0-56998";"I need to know more about this Khasda we're robbing."
"228103012-0-56999";"I'd like to know more about the Stitches before I go there."
"228103012-0-57002";"What was that you were saying about Tasnasi?"
"228103012-0-57004";"Why were you tied up in that basement?"
"228103012-0-57006";"I wouldn't expect a Wood Elf to be an expert mechanist."
"228103012-0-57007";"What's happening to you?"
"228103012-0-57016";"What's this focus you need me to recover?"
"228103012-0-57018";"What can you tell me about the Avernos?"
"228103012-0-57024";"What do you do here?"
"228103012-0-57026";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-57028";"How do you know Tasnasi?"
"228103012-0-57030";"What's your story?"
"228103012-0-57032";"Why were you practicing in the bottom of a canyon?"
"228103012-0-57033";"Who did you say gave you the lute?"
"228103012-0-57034";"Tell me more about Dashing Dasalzo."
"228103012-0-57037";"I heard you're an adept? Why would an adept be in a place like this?"
"228103012-0-57042";"What's the problem?"
"228103012-0-57045";"Who are all these people?"
"228103012-0-57048";"You said you already tried negotiating with the Goblins?"
"228103012-0-57050";"What was your part of the plan, again?"
"228103012-0-57053";"What's your part of the plan?"
"228103012-0-57057";"What's your part of the plan, again?"
"228103012-0-57060";"Can you go over the plan, again?"
"228103012-0-57062";"Let's go over your crew's roles."
"228103012-0-57069";"What's my part of the plan?"
"228103012-0-57074";"What were those images we saw? The ones with the Betrayer and the moon-priests?"
"228103012-0-57077";"The Betrayer has been destroyed. But what about you?"
"228103012-0-57078";"Are you okay now?"
"228103012-0-57080";"Are you okay now?"
"228103012-0-57081";"Remind me what we're doing here, again."
"228103012-0-57082";"Tell me more about Rakazsa."
"228103012-0-57083";"What happened to your Clan Mother?"
"228103012-0-57084";"What's the plan now?"
"228103012-0-57087";"What's the next part of the plan?"
"228103012-0-57096";"I was able to find some of her notes."
"228103012-0-57102";"Any tips for the Proof of Strength?"
"228103012-0-57105";"Where are we in relation to the south tower?"
"228103012-0-57106";"Why shouldn't I kill any of the guards?"
"228103012-0-57107";"Yes, I killed the Nereid. Were your egg-mother's notes helpful?"
"228103012-0-57109";"Why would smugglers target Ishu?"
"228103012-0-57117";"Are you all right after the failed teleportation?"
"228103012-0-57118";"What are these quotes you keep whispering? About the Whispering Claw?"
"228103012-0-57121";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"228103012-0-57122";"What about Nazdar and Vole?"
"228103012-0-57123";"Are you hurt? What happened?"
"228103012-0-57125";"You're certain you can help Nazdar?"
"228103012-0-57127";"Will you be safe here?"
"228103012-0-57128";"Any idea where we're going to find these keys?"
"228103012-0-57129";"Where's the vault?"
"228103012-0-57130";"Where did Khasda take her?"
"228103012-0-57131";"You're not coming with me?"
"228103012-0-57132";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-57135";"Were you really going to kill Magnate Feina-Darak?"
"228103012-0-57136";"I was attacked by a Dragon?"
"228103012-0-57140";"What will you do next?"
"228103012-0-57141";"What's going to happen to the crew?"
"228103012-0-57142";"Does that mean you're taking over?"
"228103012-0-57143";"What will happen to your crew?"
"228103012-0-57144";"What prompted your return?"
"228103012-0-57145";"What are you doing here, Tharayya?"
"228103012-0-57146";"What's your business with Abnur Tharn?"
"228103012-0-57151";"I couldn't help but overhear your conversation earlier. Some sort of trouble?"
"228103012-0-57155";"Khamira has agreed to your terms, but she needs your troops at the Moon Gate."
"228103012-0-57157";"Do you really believe that?"
"228103012-0-57162";"What are you talking about? You tried to kill the Stricken?"
"228103012-0-57163";"What are you talking about? You tried to kill these Unsullied?"
"228103012-0-57164";"What are the Stitches?"
"228103012-0-57165";"Tell me more about Khasda."
"228103012-0-57167";"What were the Imperials doing here?"
"228103012-0-57168";"Can you tell me more about Cicatrice?"
"228103012-0-57169";"I want to hear more about your egg-mother's research notes."
"228103012-0-57174";"Khamira wants us to gather at the Moon Gate of Anequina."
"228103012-0-57175";"I need more details about what happened to your companions."
"228103012-0-57178";"A rage of Dragons?"
"228103012-0-57181";"It's over now. We need to move on."
"228103012-0-57182";"It's over now. We need to move on."
"228103012-0-57183";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-57184";"Is the Mane here?"
"228103012-0-57186";"Khamira didn't say where she was going?"
"228103012-0-57187";"Abnur Tharn said you should return to Riverhold."
"228103012-0-57196";"Gharesh-ri said you could use my help."
"228103012-0-57198";"Do you know what exactly happened to the Nereid to corrupt her this way?"
"228103012-0-57202";"You mentioned your mate likes to hide. Any idea where I should look for him?"
"228103012-0-57203";"You said you're a priest of Two Moons. What is that?"
"228103012-0-57205";"Where did your friend, Zargha, go?"
"228103012-0-57207";"You said you're a monk of Two Moons. What is that?"
"228103012-0-57209";"Why did you put Khamira in charge of the city's defenses?"
"228103012-0-57217";"You seem extremely interested in enticing people to hunt Dragons. Why is that?"
"228103012-0-57220";"How are your companions?"
"228103012-0-57221";"What will happen to the oasis now?"
"228103012-0-57223";"It looks like I arrived ahead of Euraxia's forces."
"228103012-0-57232";"What does Grundwulf hope to accomplish by drinking the Dragon's blood?"
"228103012-0-57234";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-57235";"What can you tell me about Nisaazda?"
"228103012-0-57237";"Why do they think this smelly fork will help them hide from Dragons?"
"228103012-0-57239";"I encountered an odd character after I rescued Zargha. I think he's responsible for this."
"228103012-0-57243";"What's wrong with you?"
"228103012-0-57244";"What's your sacred mission?"
"228103012-0-57247";"Have you seen a cultist named Marthine?"
"228103012-0-57248";"How have you been surviving?"
"228103012-0-57249";"What kind of supplies do you need?"
"228103012-0-57251";"Gharesh-ri was injured and the Dragons breached the walls, allowing the Euraxians to pour in."
"228103012-0-57254";"You're Cadwell's head?"
"228103012-0-57257";"Yes. I even found a sack of moon-sugar."
"228103012-0-57262";"Euraxians were sent to get information for Zumog Phoom. He wants to recover the Betrayer's body."
"228103012-0-57265";"Why do you refer to Euraxia as the Usurper Queen?"
"228103012-0-57266";"How did Euraxia become queen of Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-57267";"What is a lich, exactly?"
"228103012-0-57275";"Your friend Filbert sent me. I'm here to set you free."
"228103012-0-57278";"What's the story behind the Skooma Cat?"
"228103012-0-57279";"What are you going to do with the fork I brought you?"
"228103012-0-57280";"Tell me about the Moon-Bishop."
"228103012-0-57285";"You want me to leave you alone here?"
"228103012-0-57292";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57294";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-57298";"The Dragons have been causing trouble?"
"228103012-0-57301";"What's Cadwell doing that requires my help?"
"228103012-0-57306";"I'm ready now."
"228103012-0-57307";"Don't you mean Banekin Run, Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-57309";"Why do you follow Peryite?"
"228103012-0-57312";"Can you tell me more about Predator Mesa?"
"228103012-0-57316";"I came to offer my help. Did you find out anything about Euraxia's final order?"
"228103012-0-57320";"What should I be looking for, again?"
"228103012-0-57321";"What are you three doing in Orcrest?"
"228103012-0-57322";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57323";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57324";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57327";"What is this place? The sentinels seem like part of the ruins."
"228103012-0-57328";"The Speaker of the Mane?"
"228103012-0-57332";"Did you find Grundwulf?"
"228103012-0-57342";"What can you tell me about these cultists?"
"228103012-0-57344";"You really like to show off your magic, don't you?"
"228103012-0-57351";"So Euraxia wasn't sent to conquer Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-57352";"You said the sword and the phylacteries are both gates. What did you mean?"
"228103012-0-57359";"He didn't make it, but he left a note. The cultists are summoning iron atronachs."
"228103012-0-57362";"I helped overthrow Euraxia, defeat the Betrayer, and stop the Dragons on the Plane of Jode."
"228103012-0-57364";"Us? Why would you want to help stop the assassination of the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-57366";"Khamira is fine, but she is resting for now. The main threat has been dealt with for now."
"228103012-0-57367";"Khamira is fine, but she is resting for now. The main threat has been dealt with for now."
"228103012-0-57372";"I can deliver the letter, but why is the Mane writing to Abnur Tharn?"
"228103012-0-57373";"How do I know we can trust you?"
"228103012-0-57382";"What did you see in your real vision?"
"228103012-0-57383";"What is the sacred sugar you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-57384";"Have you seen anything else that may have been a true prophecy?"
"228103012-0-57385";"Was anyone else harmed?"
"228103012-0-57396";"Can I ask you a few questions before you leave?"
"228103012-0-57397";"Can I ask you a few questions before you leave?"
"228103012-0-57398";"Did you learn anything important here in the manor?"
"228103012-0-57399";"Do you think we can trust Prefect Calo?"
"228103012-0-57400";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"228103012-0-57403";"Why didn't you help me against the Dragon?"
"228103012-0-57408";"Why did Alkosh come here?"
"228103012-0-57409";"You said he's the Dragon King of Cats? What's that mean?"
"228103012-0-57410";"You really believe a Divine is among us?"
"228103012-0-57427";"So Zumog Phoom can control you?"
"228103012-0-57429";"You're leaving, Tharn?"
"228103012-0-57430";"What are you going to do?"
"228103012-0-57432";"What are you going to do?"
"228103012-0-57433";"Is sparring really the best way to determine if I'm fully recovered?"
"228103012-0-57435";"You don't believe that was Alkosh?"
"228103012-0-57436";"Why did you decide to become the keeper of this shrine?"
"228103012-0-57447";"Were you and Aneshi close when you were the princess of Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-57453";"I restored the mural. Now tell me why you stole the pieces in the first place."
"228103012-0-57454";"What happened to Khamira?"
"228103012-0-57461";"You really grew up in Rimmen Palace?"
"228103012-0-57462";"I met you before, at the Falinesti Winter Site in Grahtwood."
"228103012-0-57467";"What will happen now that sanity is restored?"
"228103012-0-57473";"Khamira's ready. We can begin the coronation."
"228103012-0-57475";"I'm ready. What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-57484";"I found this keg of rotmeth beside the road. I believe it belongs to you."
"228103012-0-57485";"Are you still going to ask Tarazur to test the brew?"
"228103012-0-57496";"Is that tombstone important?"
"228103012-0-57504";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-57508";"How does all this lead to you falling out a window?"
"228103012-0-57511";"I'm listening."
"228103012-0-57514";"Here's the orb."
"228103012-0-57515";"So, Tu'heaiba hired you to find this Jewel of Baan Dar? Tell me about it."
"228103012-0-57518";"Why is Tu'heiba's location written on a note in a barrel?"
"228103012-0-57520";"Tell me about your time as the King's Claw."
"228103012-0-57521";"What should I know before we enter the Scar?"
"228103012-0-57522";"Why did Abnur Tharn send you to help me?"
"228103012-0-57530";"If the note is accurate, she's set camp near Darkpool Mine."
"228103012-0-57534";"Wait, you're going to raise him from the dead?"
"228103012-0-57536";"I didn't see where he went."
"228103012-0-57539";"This is the Way of Jode?"
"228103012-0-57542";"This is the Way of Jone?"
"228103012-0-57543";"Yes, I know Jakarn, but I'm here to pay for Fez'skar's release."
"228103012-0-57549";"I found the ledger, but it's encoded."
"228103012-0-57558";"I'm afraid not. But she told me where he is. Ruddy Fang slavers are holding him in the Tangle."
"228103012-0-57562";"Easy does it. What's the matter?"
"228103012-0-57567";"May I ask you some questions?"
"228103012-0-57568";"Are you all right, Zamarak?"
"228103012-0-57570";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"228103012-0-57575";"Saulinia is dead, but so is the Dragonguard. Did Khamira accept your terms of alliance?"
"228103012-0-57576";"Yes, I've got the key."
"228103012-0-57577";"Not yet. Tell us where you hid the Jewel of Baan Dar, first."
"228103012-0-57578";"Don't move, Fez. I'll get you out of there."
"228103012-0-57583";"What are you really doing here, Calo?"
"228103012-0-57586";"What's the story behind this Moonlight Blade?"
"228103012-0-57587";"What now? How do we find your friend?"
"228103012-0-57588";"What's in the missing package?"
"228103012-0-57595";"So, you and Mazza-Mirri know each other?"
"228103012-0-57596";"Tell me more about Rajhin."
"228103012-0-57598";"Why will these items please Rajhin?"
"228103012-0-57600";"Do I have to steal these items?"
"228103012-0-57601";"I still have questions, Mazza-Mirri."
"228103012-0-57613";"Jakarn, what are you doing?"
"228103012-0-57616";"So, why do you hesitate?"
"228103012-0-57626";"Fez'skar is dead. He jumped off a cliff trying to get the Jewel of Baan Dar."
"228103012-0-57634";"How is Khamira handling her new role, Lyrrsazhi?"
"228103012-0-57635";"We killed Euraxia after Nala-do died, but the Dragons and necromancers are still working together."
"228103012-0-57639";"That was weird."
"228103012-0-57646";"The Dragonhorn at the adeptorium? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-57648";"Star Haven?"
"228103012-0-57659";"You don't have any regrets about killing your sister?"
"228103012-0-57672";"Javad Tharn was your son? He tried to destroy Reaper's March."
"228103012-0-57673";"When we faced Mannimarco and Molag Bal, you were stronger than this. What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-57678";"What will happen to your clan, now that he's gone?"
"228103012-0-57679";"Do you live in Riverhold?"
"228103012-0-57686";"You look ill. What's your affliction?"
"228103012-0-57691";"We should come up with a plan for negotiating with Euraxia."
"228103012-0-57696";"Remind me. What's happening here again?"
"228103012-0-57697";"Remind me. What's happening here again?"
"228103012-0-57699";"Remind me. What's happening here again?"
"228103012-0-57704";"You really find Abnur Tharn attractive?"
"228103012-0-57705";"You don't know how to use the Dragonhorn?"
"228103012-0-57707";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57708";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-57712";"[Lie] Sugar-Slinger is expecting me."
"228103012-0-57715";"I still don't understand why you were in exile, Zamarak."
"228103012-0-57716";"Where can you take me?"
"228103012-0-57717";"Grahtwood, please."
"228103012-0-57718";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-57719";"Stormhaven is my destination."
"228103012-0-57720";"Take me to Rimmen."
"228103012-0-57721";"[Lie] Sugar-Slinger wants me back in Riverhold."
"228103012-0-57728";"Actually, I'm here to pick up a package for Rigurt."
"228103012-0-57730";"Will you show me the invoice again?"
"228103012-0-57732";"I don't owe you anything. In fact, I might report you to the Imperials for extortion."
"228103012-0-57735";"Yes, but I had to reimburse Thadarra for the delivery fee."
"228103012-0-57737";"Yes. Thadarra paid your delivery fee."
"228103012-0-57739";"I have the crystal."
"228103012-0-57741";"I brought honey flowers, but aren't you supposed to add them in the beginning?"
"228103012-0-57744";"The Nord ambassador, Rigurt, would like you to sample his sweetbread."
"228103012-0-57745";"Should sweetbread be tough?"
"228103012-0-57747";"We found this necklace and scarf near the smuggler camps."
"228103012-0-57752";"Sugar cakes?"
"228103012-0-57757";"Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-57764";"What's wrong with them?"
"228103012-0-57766";"What kind of information do these scrolls contain?"
"228103012-0-57768";"We apologize, Lady Izza. We only wanted to impress you."
"228103012-0-57774";"They can't make it, but they let me borrow a lute and drum."
"228103012-0-57778";"You have an awful lot of cats."
"228103012-0-57784";"Why did you abduct Zinthia?"
"228103012-0-57785";"Why do you need Hircine's blessing, exactly?"
"228103012-0-57788";"Are you sure this powder will work?"
"228103012-0-57789";"Has Rideza been troubling Riverhold for long?"
"228103012-0-57794";"Why didn't you tell me that Zinthia was a cat?"
"228103012-0-57795";"Any suggestions on how to interrupt the rituals?"
"228103012-0-57799";"Is this tea really that good?"
"228103012-0-57804";"Do you know where the Dragon went?"
"228103012-0-57807";"How did you wind up as part of the ritual?"
"228103012-0-57808";"Snap out of it, Zamarak. We need to find Zumog Phoom and stop his ritual."
"228103012-0-57809";"What was the purpose of that ritual?"
"228103012-0-57810";"How are things back in town? Have the Euraxians attacked yet?"
"228103012-0-57813";"The Dark Behind the World?"
"228103012-0-57814";"You've been luring people into bondage."
"228103012-0-57818";"Not that I'm aware of."
"228103012-0-57822";"Are you ready to accept that your faith is misplaced?"
"228103012-0-57824";"What will you do, now that you're free from the Dragons?"
"228103012-0-57825";"Khunzar-ri?"
"228103012-0-57826";"What will you do with Azin-jo?"
"228103012-0-57830";"How will your temple recover from this?"
"228103012-0-57831";"How did the Dragon convince you he was Alkosh?"
"228103012-0-57832";"What will you do with the people you lured here?"
"228103012-0-57840";"Why can't you come with me yourself?"
"228103012-0-57845";"You're remembering more about the time before you became a Soul Shriven?"
"228103012-0-57847";"What kind of spells will we trigger?"
"228103012-0-57849";"Won't Euraxia have the palace on high alert?"
"228103012-0-57852";"Who is this Shalani you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-57856";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-57859";"Tell me more about the Dragons."
"228103012-0-57861";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-57865";"You must know something about the Anequina Dragonhorn."
"228103012-0-57867";"Why does everything seem to point back to the legends of Khunzar-ri?"
"228103012-0-57870";"Where are Zamarak and Prefect Calo? I thought they were going to meet us here."
"228103012-0-57871";"Cadwell, it's me. What's going on?"
"228103012-0-57872";"I don't have any questions. Let's set out."
"228103012-0-57878";"What kind of trap?"
"228103012-0-57879";"Scare the horses and set fire to the supply carts. Basically cause general mayhem."
"228103012-0-57881";"What can you tell me about this place, the Ashen Scar?"
"228103012-0-57882";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-57884";"Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-57886";"What's an Alfiq, again?"
"228103012-0-57892";"Where is the Shadow Dance Ruins?"
"228103012-0-57893";"Why are you here?"
"228103012-0-57894";"How could the Betrayer get in here without your pendant?"
"228103012-0-57895";"Do you know what the relic is?"
"228103012-0-57896";"What do you mean, attuned?"
"228103012-0-57900";"Are you sure this is wise, Khamira?"
"228103012-0-57901";"How do you know all this, Khamira?"
"228103012-0-57909";"Are you attuned to the Lunar Lattice now?"
"228103012-0-57911";"Do you have any advice on fighting the Betrayer?"
"228103012-0-57912";"Why don't you try talking to him about it?"
"228103012-0-57913";"Tell me more about your half-sister, Euraxia."
"228103012-0-57914";"xxx"
"228103012-0-57915";"But won't it eat my soul?"
"228103012-0-57918";"But won't it eat my soul?"
"228103012-0-57921";"Can I use Volendrung again?"
"228103012-0-57922";"Do you plan on acquiring more of the greater artifacts?"
"228103012-0-57923";"There's no chance of me bringing the Wabbajack into Cyrodiil?"
"228103012-0-57924";"xxx"
"228103012-0-57926";"How will this stone help you summon a spirit?"
"228103012-0-57935";"Tell me about your horse."
"228103012-0-57939";"You're sure that no one at S'rendarr's Cradle wears a habit like this?"
"228103012-0-57940";"This guar belongs to <<1>>."
"228103012-0-57944";"You can speak?"
"228103012-0-57946";"Look what I've got."
"228103012-0-57948";"Look what I've got."
"228103012-0-57950";"Look what I've got."
"228103012-0-57952";"I'm working with Mizzik to find your daughter. Any details you can share would help."
"228103012-0-57958";"I found three bottles of wine."
"228103012-0-57968";"Do you have any thoughts on why the Khajiit consider this master a pariah?"
"228103012-0-57969";"Is this Vhysradue really an Akaviri warrior?"
"228103012-0-57971";"Have you dealt with this bird before?"
"228103012-0-57972";"I thought you were against killing any guards."
"228103012-0-57974";"You can keep things quiet?"
"228103012-0-57982";"Do you really think the Moonlight Blade can destroy Arum-Khal?"
"228103012-0-57987";"Are you feeling all right?"
"228103012-0-57991";"Can you tell me more about the Temple of the Hidden Moon?"
"228103012-0-57994";"What makes Arum-Khal more dangerous than other liches?"
"228103012-0-57997";"You said Arum-Khal wants to be free of Azurah? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-58003";"What will happen to your soul when this realm expires?"
"228103012-0-58008";"Why can't you trek through the sewers to find the dead drop yourself?"
"228103012-0-58010";"How much time do we have?"
"228103012-0-58013";"Any word on Abnur Tharn or Zamarak? Did they return from the Shadow Dance Ruins?"
"228103012-0-58014";"Look what I found."
"228103012-0-58016";"I found this head. Another one of your toys?"
"228103012-0-58018";"I have this cheese."
"228103012-0-58021";"So, you couldn't beat the location of the jewel out of Fez'skar?"
"228103012-0-58029";"Wait, you think he's going to double-cross us? I thought you said he was your friend."
"228103012-0-58030";"How do you feel about holding the Proving Festival after so long?"
"228103012-0-58036";"I brought you fresh game from a hunter's trap."
"228103012-0-58037";"What man with the pot on his head?"
"228103012-0-58041";"You seem rather happy, given all that's happened."
"228103012-0-58044";"So, you're some sort of priest?"
"228103012-0-58045";"What have you been doing since we met in Summerset?"
"228103012-0-58046";"Tell me more about Peryite."
"228103012-0-58047";"What happened at the other sites you visited before you found this gravestone?"
"228103012-0-58056";"What can you tell me about Azura?"
"228103012-0-58060";"I remember you, Vastarie. We worked together once before, in Grahtwood."
"228103012-0-58065";"How did you become so famous?"
"228103012-0-58069";"What will you do next, Rigurt?"
"228103012-0-58095";"Can you tell me more about this dro-m'Athra, Zalsheem?"
"228103012-0-58103";"What were you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-58106";"Why are Akaviri relics in a Khajiiti tomb?"
"228103012-0-58107";"Why are Akaviri relics in a Khajiiti tomb?"
"228103012-0-58109";"Would you still want to free Fez'skar if you didn't need the jewel?"
"228103012-0-58112";"Remind me why retrieving the Jewel of Baan Dar is so important?"
"228103012-0-58115";"How did you become a vampire?"
"228103012-0-58119";"How's that?"
"228103012-0-58124";"What's next for you, Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-58127";"So you're done hunting Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-58129";"Why do you think Fez left the chest on that cliff?"
"228103012-0-58134";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-58137";"Why are you willing to sell a fellow Khajiit into slavery?"
"228103012-0-58142";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58143";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58144";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58145";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58146";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58147";"Reference"
"228103012-0-58148";"What did you say those dark spirits were called?"
"228103012-0-58155";"I see many kinds of Khajiit here. Mind if I ask them a few questions about themselves?"
"228103012-0-58163";"What brings all of you here?"
"228103012-0-58166";"Please do share your insights about the Alfiq."
"228103012-0-58167";"I'm curious as to what you have to say about the Alfiq, yes."
"228103012-0-58168";"Why don't you tell me about the Senche-raht?"
"228103012-0-58169";"Uh, what surprise?"
"228103012-0-58173";"What knowledge do you think would help?"
"228103012-0-58174";"Yes, please do tell me more about the Khajiit."
"228103012-0-58175";"What happened to your companions?"
"228103012-0-58176";"I was wondering if you could share more knowledge of the Pahmar-raht."
"228103012-0-58177";"Now that you mention it, yes, learning more about the Pahmar-raht sounds useful."
"228103012-0-58180";"You're quite an eclectic bunch."
"228103012-0-58184";"What have you been doing since the last time I saw you?"
"228103012-0-58185";"Are you going to return to Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-58186";"Now that the Dragon is dead, are you going back to Riverhold?"
"228103012-0-58187";"What do you plan to do next?"
"228103012-0-58188";"You were kicked out of Rimmen?"
"228103012-0-58189";"Have you yourself seen any necromancers?"
"228103012-0-58190";"Are Dragons why you left Riverhold?"
"228103012-0-58192";"Where is the Moon Gate of Anequina?"
"228103012-0-58194";"So, what actually happened to you at the Shadow Dance Temple?"
"228103012-0-58195";"Why are Akaviri relics in a Khajiiti tomb?"
"228103012-0-58200";"You know how to use the Dragonhorn?"
"228103012-0-58203";"Speaking of Dragons, what happened after Khamira and I entered the temple?"
"228103012-0-58209";"Won't the water rust your armor?"
"228103012-0-58224";"What are you doing to Sizenza?"
"228103012-0-58225";"What are these Shades of Arum-Khal, exactly?"
"228103012-0-58230";"I need a moment to prepare."
"228103012-0-58231";"Why have you come to Riverhold?"
"228103012-0-58235";"Why are you teaching them?"
"228103012-0-58236";"What's so bad about learning the pantheon?"
"228103012-0-58237";"So, this moon-priest showed up offering food if you listen to him?"
"228103012-0-58240";"You collect cursed items. Are you cursed, too?"
"228103012-0-58241";"Are you cursed?"
"228103012-0-58245";"How did Khamira seem to you?"
"228103012-0-58246";"What kind of impending doom are we talking about?"
"228103012-0-58249";"Isn't the Dragon threat over now?"
"228103012-0-58250";"Khamira is fine. As a matter of fact, she sent me to find out what happened to you."
"228103012-0-58252";"Your injuries, do you need to see the healers?"
"228103012-0-58253";"Khamira sent me to find out what happened to you and the others."
"228103012-0-58257";"What will you do now, Zamarak?"
"228103012-0-58258";"That's what brought me here. Khamira wants to know what happened after we entered the Moon Gate."
"228103012-0-58262";"What will you and the Cygnus Irregulars do now?"
"228103012-0-58270";"You think Kaalgrontiid is still a threat?"
"228103012-0-58271";"Khamira said she wanted you as her King's, or rather Queen's Claw?"
"228103012-0-58273";"How has the adeptorium been since the Dragon attack?"
"228103012-0-58274";"It is something. How are things going in the Ashen Scar?"
"228103012-0-58275";"Did you come to attend the queen's coronation?"
"228103012-0-58276";"Why is the mural so important to you?"
"228103012-0-58277";"The stories are true."
"228103012-0-58279";"How are you doing, Mizzik?"
"228103012-0-58280";"What are you doing here, Iokkas?"
"228103012-0-58281";"How is the Prowl now that the poachers are gone?"
"228103012-0-58282";"Weren't you leaving to go on a new mission?"
"228103012-0-58283";"What does a queen do, exactly?"
"228103012-0-58284";"So I guess your days as an agent of the Mane are behind you now?"
"228103012-0-58285";"What's next for the Speaker of the Mane?"
"228103012-0-58288";"What's next for Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-58289";"Your true calling? Adept or Queen's Claw?"
"228103012-0-58291";"Did you determine what happens next for the Cygnus Irregulars?"
"228103012-0-58296";"Why did you steal the mural pieces?"
"228103012-0-58302";"Where have you been since the last time I saw you?"
"228103012-0-58303";"What happened to the Amulet of Kings?"
"228103012-0-58304";"Have you seen or heard from the other Companions?"
"228103012-0-58305";"Cadwell! What have you been up to since we last saw each other?"
"228103012-0-58307";"What are these descrying stones, exactly?"
"228103012-0-58312";"Where is the chancel?"
"228103012-0-58318";"Is this Alfiq really a spirit? She seems like flesh and blood to me."
"228103012-0-58338";"Those Khajiit that attacked us. You don't recognize them?"
"228103012-0-58339";"You still believe this Dragon is Alkosh?"
"228103012-0-58346";"Cadwell! I didn't expect to find you here."
"228103012-0-58354";"So why do you hesitate?"
"228103012-0-58355";"So why do you hesitate?"
"228103012-0-58356";"So why do you hesitate?"
"228103012-0-58359";"Care to explain your side of this misunderstanding?"
"228103012-0-58363";"You mentioned someone named Dasalzo?"
"228103012-0-58366";"You're worried about Abnur Tharn?"
"228103012-0-58367";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58368";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58369";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58370";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58371";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58372";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58373";"Can you remind me what we're doing here again?"
"228103012-0-58378";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-58379";"How am I to collect the mural pieces now?"
"228103012-0-58386";"Sure. What are the words of your beginnings?"
"228103012-0-58394";"Do you know anything else about this Thannar?"
"228103012-0-58397";"You said Na'ruzz claimed the Bone Pits before?"
"228103012-0-58399";"Which two kingdoms ruled?"
"228103012-0-58411";"What else can you tell me about Zav'i and Akumjhargo?"
"228103012-0-58416";"Couldn't you or your brother take charge?"
"228103012-0-58417";"You think she'll be good for the Stitches?"
"228103012-0-58418";"So, Shando-ri was really able to redeem Arum-Khal?"
"228103012-0-58421";"Can't we use the horn as it is?"
"228103012-0-58422";"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-58427";"What do you need?"
"228103012-0-58432";"Looking for some new recruits?"
"228103012-0-58433";"I'll visit where I like, Dominion cur."
"228103012-0-58435";"Snap out of it. We need to find Phoom and stop his ritual."
"228103012-0-58436";"How can I get to Phoom?"
"228103012-0-58437";"Aren't those the robes I stole for Rajhin?"
"228103012-0-58438";"What was the purpose of that ritual?"
"228103012-0-58439";"I just came to see how things are doing now."
"228103012-0-58443";"I haven't seen Haduras. Where is he?"
"228103012-0-58444";"I'd like to hear more about your grandfather's legacy."
"228103012-0-58446";"How have you been?"
"228103012-0-58450";"What happened to you during the battle at the Moon Gate?"
"228103012-0-58454";"What's happening to you?"
"228103012-0-58455";"Cadwell's old body was resurrected, but our Cadwell was lost in the process."
"228103012-0-58457";"What's your relationship to Grundwulf?"
"228103012-0-58461";"Will you be sticking around?"
"228103012-0-58466";"You patched things up with Jubani?"
"228103012-0-58469";"You're not drunk again, are you?"
"228103012-0-58471";"Any word on Abnur Tharn or Zamarak? Did they return from the Shadow Dance Ruins?"
"228103012-0-58474";"How are things?"
"228103012-0-58476";"How's leadership treating you?"
"228103012-0-58480";"Sereyne? You don't recognize me?"
"228103012-0-58485";"Are things that bad?"
"228103012-0-58487";"No one sent me. What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-58491";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-58496";"I want to know more about the Akaviri Potentate."
"228103012-0-58497";"Can you tell me more about the Akaviri?"
"228103012-0-58500";"Where is Riverhold?"
"228103012-0-58501";"Are you able to portal us down to the core?"
"228103012-0-58502";"No valuables?"
"228103012-0-58503";"What were you doing out here by yourself?"
"228103012-0-58505";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-58508";"You're sure you're just tired?"
"228103012-0-58510";"You look like you're ready for the ceremony."
"228103012-0-58511";"What's next for Cadwell?"
"228103012-0-58512";"Did you determine what happens next for the Cygnus Irregulars?"
"228103012-0-58515";"K'har Zhab Hall. What is that?"
"228103012-0-58516";"Remind me. What's our current situation?"
"228103012-0-58520";"What's an assassination squad?"
"228103012-0-58533";"Remind me. What's the significance of the Moon Gate again?"
"228103012-0-58534";"Remind me. What's the significance of the Moon Gate again?"
"228103012-0-58535";"Why am I locked in this room?"
"228103012-0-58545";"Who are these attackers?"
"228103012-0-58553";"What are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-58554";"Why do you think you had a dream about this gravestone?"
"228103012-0-58593";"I'd like to know more about you all. First, who are you?"
"228103012-0-58596";"Why do you believe the Dragon is the source of the blight?"
"228103012-0-58597";"If your plan is such a gamble, why not try something less risky?"
"228103012-0-58598";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-58600";"I joined your expedition in Malabal Tor to find Selene."
"228103012-0-58601";"You sound like you don't agree with this plan."
"228103012-0-58603";"How confident are you that Selene will keep her vow?"
"228103012-0-58604";"Allanwen believes we need Carindon to succeed."
"228103012-0-58605";"Both times you attacked unprovoked."
"228103012-0-58606";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-58607";"You think she's going to turn Allanwen and Gadnalon against us?"
"228103012-0-58608";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-58612";"Are you having trouble keeping control?"
"228103012-0-58651";"There's another Dragon who might help us, but we don't know where to find him."
"228103012-0-58653";"Elsweyr is in danger. We seek the Dragon Yahgrondu to help us save it."
"228103012-0-58654";"She'll help us, but we need to return a temple bell you stole."
"228103012-0-58655";"Kaalgrontiid? We dealt with him at Jode's Core."
"228103012-0-58656";"Where have you been since we worked together in Northern Elsweyr?"
"228103012-0-58666";"Tell me more about this Dragonguard seal."
"228103012-0-58668";"How did you become an expert on the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-58672";"What does this ritual involve?"
"228103012-0-58674";"How are we going to cleanse the bell now?"
"228103012-0-58678";"We'll be on our way as soon as you tell us where to go."
"228103012-0-58681";"I have some questions about what you need me to do."
"228103012-0-58686";"Yes, I found a map to a Dragonguard sanctuary."
"228103012-0-58695";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-58697";"Let's go to one of the Dragonguard temples."
"228103012-0-58702";"Let's travel to the Abbey of Blades."
"228103012-0-58704";"Why do you call this place Dragonhold?"
"228103012-0-58707";"Why do you call it an aegis?"
"228103012-0-58711";"Why would a legend be forbidden?"
"228103012-0-58715";"You sacrificed yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings. You should be dead!"
"228103012-0-58716";"Tharn, tell me more about the Dark Aeon."
"228103012-0-58718";"Of course. What have you been doing since we last met, Sai?"
"228103012-0-58719";"You were the captain of the Dragonguard? So you know how to hunt Dragons?"
"228103012-0-58720";"Perhaps these maps will help. They show the locations of two Dragonguard sanctuaries."
"228103012-0-58724";"Why should I trust you?"
"228103012-0-58725";"Thanks for your help."
"228103012-0-58727";"You were lying in Selene's Web and you're lying now."
"228103012-0-58728";"How do you know this Yahgrondu will help us?"
"228103012-0-58730";"Any idea what purpose these ritual sites serve?"
"228103012-0-58731";"Why would prophecy be a more accurate term?"
"228103012-0-58737";"The cult is mining a strange green stone. Nahfahlaar thinks it can amplify magic."
"228103012-0-58740";"Tell me more about Black Heights."
"228103012-0-58741";"Tell me more about Khenarthi's Breath Temple."
"228103012-0-58743";"You stole the bell to buy your ship?"
"228103012-0-58744";"Tell me more about Moonlit Cove."
"228103012-0-58745";"The Confederacy?"
"228103012-0-58746";"I'm sensing that you and Abnur Tharn don't get along."
"228103012-0-58747";"No, but I found another journal. It says that the Dragonhorn resides in Dark Water Temple."
"228103012-0-58755";"I found another journal. It says a Dragon named Vahlokzin stole the Dragonhorn."
"228103012-0-58758";"I found a journal. The Dragonguard came here in search of the Horn of Ja'darri."
"228103012-0-58760";"He can't stop. He says Khenarthi is the key."
"228103012-0-58762";"We learned of a Dragonguard weapon called the Horn of Ja'darri. It's a powerful Dragonhorn."
"228103012-0-58777";"How are you feeling?"
"228103012-0-58778";"You mean your attunement, don't you?"
"228103012-0-58779";"You believe he made it?"
"228103012-0-58783";"Let's open it and find out."
"228103012-0-58785";"Yes, I've collected them all. What is Vijari doing here?"
"228103012-0-58790";"You're Khunzar-ri? The mythic Khajiit hero?"
"228103012-0-58794";"The scion of Anequina?"
"228103012-0-58796";"We can go anywhere by walking the Jonelight Path?"
"228103012-0-58801";"So how can we stop Kaalgrontiid?"
"228103012-0-58802";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-58806";"Dak'radhi's the one doing this. I saw his memories."
"228103012-0-58810";"Could you look at this list of ingredients and tell me if you've got any idea what I'm looking for?"
"228103012-0-58817";"I'm ready."
"228103012-0-58823";"Tharn, you don't look so good."
"228103012-0-58830";"Tell me how to stop this, Tharn."
"228103012-0-58840";"I'll defend you. Let's finish this."
"228103012-0-58843";"I'm really here."
"228103012-0-58845";"I'm ready to depart. (Fast Travel to Vahlokzin's lair)"
"228103012-0-58846";"And the Horn of Ja'darri is an opportunity?"
"228103012-0-58849";"Sai is fine. We defeated Vahlokzin and retrieved the Horn of Ja'darri."
"228103012-0-58851";"Abnur Tharn will be remembered."
"228103012-0-58852";"Where are Sai Sahan and Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-58856";"I'm here about a Dragon cult that may be recruiting in your city. They wear dark robes."
"228103012-0-58863";"What does this alternative method involve?"
"228103012-0-58865";"I need to see General Renmus today."
"228103012-0-58870";"I need diplomatic papers to get me and a friend in to see General Renmus."
"228103012-0-58875";"I was. Everything's ready for our appointment."
"228103012-0-58888";"Are you Safik? Your sister sent me to check on you and your friends."
"228103012-0-58889";"I'll help, but Safik seems worried."
"228103012-0-58891";"The hero of Dragonhold?"
"228103012-0-58892";"Khamira, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-58894";"He helped Tharn contain the explosion. They saved Tamriel. He didn't know Abnur's fate, though."
"228103012-0-58934";"Have you really decided to leave your old life behind you, Za'ji?"
"228103012-0-58935";"Other than a celebration, do you have any plans for the future, Za'ji?"
"228103012-0-58939";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-58943";"I suppose it's the thought that counts."
"228103012-0-58946";"So, no more talk of leaving the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-58947";"I agreed to investigate your daughter's disappearance."
"228103012-0-58950";"What happened on Dragonhold at the very end, Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-58954";"We're looking for Lahini. She's missing."
"228103012-0-58960";"Yes. Think you can convince Kazahn over there to talk?"
"228103012-0-58961";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-58966";"Queen Khamira sent me to offer the Shields a position in the restored Elsweyr Confederacy."
"228103012-0-58969";"What will you do back in Cyrodiil?"
"228103012-0-58970";"Tell me what you know about Lahini, and we'll be on our way."
"228103012-0-58973";"We plan to travel to a nearby island and hunt the Dragon down. That's why we need a ship."
"228103012-0-58977";"I'd like to hear more about Senchal. Let's walk together."
"228103012-0-58978";"I'd rather meet you in the city's outskirts."
"228103012-0-58981";"Yes, I think I can."
"228103012-0-58985";"A note. The cult is recruiting at an underground arena in the Black Kiergo."
"228103012-0-58988";"Tell me more about the Black Kiergo."
"228103012-0-58989";"You lost your lady love? Who was she?"
"228103012-0-58993";"Why do you think Nartise stole your ship?"
"228103012-0-58997";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-58999";"What's your point?"
"228103012-0-59000";"Are you absolutely sure? They might have gone somewhere else to hide, right?"
"228103012-0-59005";"Who's Ra'khajin?"
"228103012-0-59006";"Tell me more about the Order of the New Moon."
"228103012-0-59007";"Not yet. Can you walk?"
"228103012-0-59010";"My friend and I are initiates. Here's our pendant."
"228103012-0-59011";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-59016";"We need to focus on finding Lahini."
"228103012-0-59018";"I'm ready to head to Wind Scour Temple in Alik'r."
"228103012-0-59021";"You're welcome. What happens now?"
"228103012-0-59025";"This has something to do with the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-59028";"Can you ring the bells again? I want to see the lanterns glow."
"228103012-0-59030";"Darkness? Sai said you were speaking in riddles."
"228103012-0-59035";"How long have you been in Senchal?"
"228103012-0-59037";"I'd rather take my own approach. Perhaps we should split from Za'ji and Caska."
"228103012-0-59041";"You opened that portal?"
"228103012-0-59046";"You and Sai Sahan don't seem to get along."
"228103012-0-59047";"What do you mean you no longer have the ship?"
"228103012-0-59053";"Who's Khunzar-ri?"
"228103012-0-59055";"Do you think Nartise will drown?"
"228103012-0-59059";"Do you think they'll rescind on their offer to sail us to the island?"
"228103012-0-59061";"It doesn't sound like we have a choice."
"228103012-0-59065";"The cultists were stockpiling aeonstone in some sort of amphitheater."
"228103012-0-59068";"Any idea where we should look for another entrance?"
"228103012-0-59078";"What was Grundwulf doing with his voice? Magic?"
"228103012-0-59080";"Nishzo was dead, but I did find his piece of the tapestry."
"228103012-0-59084";"Yes, we're about to set sail now."
"228103012-0-59089";"Aeliah wants to help us slay the Dragon."
"228103012-0-59090";"The Order of the New Moon, a Dragon cult. They're led by the Dragon Priest Ra'khajin."
"228103012-0-59093";"I'd like to know more about Grundwulf."
"228103012-0-59098";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-59101";"I'm not sure why, but I think they're after the Clan Mother."
"228103012-0-59106";"Well, you certainly sound better."
"228103012-0-59108";"How do you want to proceed?"
"228103012-0-59114";"All the more reason for us to slay this Dragon."
"228103012-0-59120";"What goals do we share?"
"228103012-0-59124";"I need to know why the cult attacked you."
"228103012-0-59127";"Any idea what we can expect on the island?"
"228103012-0-59130";"The statue represents Ja'darri. The inscription mentions a red beast's horn and a divine mask."
"228103012-0-59132";"What do you think Laatvulon is doing?"
"228103012-0-59139";"I'm ready, lets go."
"228103012-0-59140";"Are you sure you want to come along? You could let Sai Sahan know what we learned."
"228103012-0-59142";"Looks like that's Akaviri."
"228103012-0-59143";"Za'ji said you might be able to help the Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-59147";"I accept Khenarthi's blessing."
"228103012-0-59149";"What is Pridehome? Why are we attacking it?"
"228103012-0-59160";"What about the aegis protecting the island? Aren't we supposed to be lowering it?"
"228103012-0-59161";"Why do you want to find a way to battle the Dragons?"
"228103012-0-59162";"How did you convince the elders in Elden Root to go along with this plan?"
"228103012-0-59163";"What have you been up to since Coldharbour?"
"228103012-0-59164";"I still can't believe you're alive. How did you survive the sacrifice?"
"228103012-0-59165";"I found a note and half-melted token of some kind."
"228103012-0-59173";"The cult plans to attack Pridehome."
"228103012-0-59175";"Sai Sahan would like your crew to join us as members of the Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-59177";"Sai Sahan wants to reform the Dragonguard. Will you become a member?"
"228103012-0-59179";"How would you like to join the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-59180";"Yes. They're called the Order of the New Moon and they're a sizable force."
"228103012-0-59181";"I found this token. Someone said you might pay for it."
"228103012-0-59199";"We're in. I have the location of the cult's fortress in the Tenmar Forest."
"228103012-0-59201";"What happens when we find the wounded Dragon?"
"228103012-0-59202";"You were supposed to make a delivery to Auberic Dufont."
"228103012-0-59205";"Do you do good business out here in the marketplace?"
"228103012-0-59207";"I'd like to participate in your hunting expedition."
"228103012-0-59228";"Kaalgrontiid is trying to become a god. The floating island is part of his plan."
"228103012-0-59233";"Is the Dragonguard ready to face Kaalgrontiid?"
"228103012-0-59234";"How did you know where to find me?"
"228103012-0-59238";"We have to go to a statue of the Forgotten Mane, south of here. There should be bells nearby."
"228103012-0-59240";"Lady G hosts a hunting expedition where wealthy customers can hunt people."
"228103012-0-59245";"Yes, I'm ready."
"228103012-0-59247";"Yes, I used it to reach the roof of the training hall."
"228103012-0-59250";"His grave? He died here in this warehouse?"
"228103012-0-59252";"Here, Sai. You should take the Dragonhorn."
"228103012-0-59253";"So Sai is in a bad mood?"
"228103012-0-59254";"Old companion?"
"228103012-0-59257";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-59260";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-59266";"Try not to move. Your wounds look pretty severe."
"228103012-0-59270";"I'm here on behalf of Lady Ghisliane. The Orc is my bodyguard."
"228103012-0-59279";"That depends. Is the Order of the New Moon recruiting today?"
"228103012-0-59289";"The Dragon seemed to know you."
"228103012-0-59290";"Me? How is that possible? I thought you were accessing Anequina's memories."
"228103012-0-59294";"Do you know where they went?"
"228103012-0-59296";"I've seen it happen from time to time."
"228103012-0-59297";"Before we depart, can we review what we learned at the Dragonguard sanctuaries?"
"228103012-0-59301";"I'm sorry about Tajahir."
"228103012-0-59308";"Are you all right, Marekki?"
"228103012-0-59313";"Are we truly prepared to face a Dragon?"
"228103012-0-59318";"Is that why you've come to the Abbey of the Blades?"
"228103012-0-59322";"Hello, Allanwen. What brings you to the Abbey of Blades?"
"228103012-0-59328";"Yes, of course. Do you know where they took Galeneth?"
"228103012-0-59330";"Calm down. Daini sent me to rescue you, not recruit you. You should get to safety."
"228103012-0-59332";"Are we truly prepared to face a Dragon?"
"228103012-0-59335";"Any idea what lies ahead?"
"228103012-0-59336";"I'd like to train with the grappling bow some more."
"228103012-0-59337";"What is this shrine?"
"228103012-0-59341";"Is that Lyris Titanborn's axe?"
"228103012-0-59344";"Is that Lyris Titanborn's axe?"
"228103012-0-59348";"Is that Lyris Titanborn's axe?"
"228103012-0-59351";"We found the tomb of Khunzar-ri."
"228103012-0-59352";"This is all I was able to salvage."
"228103012-0-59356";"There were Dragonguard here searching for the Horn of Ja'darri."
"228103012-0-59358";"The inscription also mentions a fight with the Black Beast."
"228103012-0-59364";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"228103012-0-59365";"We're looking for two Dragons battling each other, one red and the other black."
"228103012-0-59369";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-59372";"Why have you chosen to fight Dragons?"
"228103012-0-59375";"How are you here? I watched you sacrifice yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings!"
"228103012-0-59378";"Have you brought the Horn of Ja'darri with you?"
"228103012-0-59383";"Khamira is studying the claw now. What's General Renmus doing here?"
"228103012-0-59386";"What's the Jonelight Path and how will it help us reach Dragonhold?"
"228103012-0-59391";"How did you come up with this plan to meet General Renmus?"
"228103012-0-59393";"You want me to drink the sullied water?"
"228103012-0-59394";"Why did smugglers take over Moonlit Cove?"
"228103012-0-59395";"Can you tell me more about the grappling bow?"
"228103012-0-59399";"You know the place?"
"228103012-0-59401";"I'm with you, but what about the others?"
"228103012-0-59404";"Tell me more about your uncle and his gourmet moon-sugar."
"228103012-0-59408";"How many thieves attacked your camp?"
"228103012-0-59421";"We learned about Ja'darri. She fought Laatvulon alongside you and the Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-59423";"Ra'khajin served the Dragons."
"228103012-0-59427";"Where's Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-59428";"Slow down. What happened here?"
"228103012-0-59429";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-59430";"Yes. I've completed the dungeon."
"228103012-0-59432";"I'm not allied with any graverobbers. What happened here?"
"228103012-0-59433";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-59434";"Yes. I've completed the dungeon."
"228103012-0-59449";"Yes, he's studying them now. He suggested I talk with you about the grappling bow."
"228103012-0-59453";"There must have been a way for the Dragonguard to reach it."
"228103012-0-59457";"Do you have any ideas?"
"228103012-0-59462";"Tell me more about Blademaster Kasura."
"228103012-0-59464";"I haven't seen Blademaster Kasura since the night Mannimarco attacked. How is she and the abbey?"
"228103012-0-59468";"Yahgrondu is in a mine on the southern coast. There's limestone nearby."
"228103012-0-59473";"Were you able to spot anything?"
"228103012-0-59475";"What should we search for in Wind Scour Temple?"
"228103012-0-59481";"You said these caravaners were criminals. What else do you know about them?"
"228103012-0-59482";"Where have you been?"
"228103012-0-59492";"What do you need my help with?"
"228103012-0-59499";"Any ideas?"
"228103012-0-59500";"How do you know about this warehouse?"
"228103012-0-59504";"Why don't you come with us, Kasura?"
"228103012-0-59507";"The cult seeks a divine mask that belongs to the Pride of Alkosh. We need to find it first."
"228103012-0-59514";"What happened to you after the island started to rise?"
"228103012-0-59518";"How do we destroy the focal points?"
"228103012-0-59519";"What do you know about this place?"
"228103012-0-59521";"State dinners? Are you a diplomat of some kind?"
"228103012-0-59523";"Who are you? Did you write this letter?"
"228103012-0-59524";"A Dragonguard tried to lower the drawbridge. She left a note behind, which contains a riddle."
"228103012-0-59527";"We only have one what?"
"228103012-0-59533";"What about the portal at the New Moon Fortress?"
"228103012-0-59536";"After you train with the Dragonhorn, what happens next?"
"228103012-0-59537";"What's next for you, Kasura?"
"228103012-0-59538";"Have you spoken with the other Companions lately?"
"228103012-0-59542";"How does this cantor's tonic work?"
"228103012-0-59549";"I drank your cantor's tonic. What am I looking for again?"
"228103012-0-59555";"Decipher them how?"
"228103012-0-59561";"Vijari! You have to stop dancing! It's changing you!"
"228103012-0-59569";"I'm curious—why were you offering that High Elf a hoarvor?"
"228103012-0-59573";"Yes, I found Selloe. She promised to arrange a meeting with Lady G if I did a job for her."
"228103012-0-59575";"That happened so long ago. Can we be sure the Dragonhorn still exists?"
"228103012-0-59578";"It is possible that the Dragonguard who left the journals may have already reclaimed the Dragonhorn?"
"228103012-0-59597";"What do you do here?"
"228103012-0-59598";"Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-59602";"Why does the Forsaken Citadel contain Akaviri tomes?"
"228103012-0-59604";"I saw your job posting. What kind of work are you offering?"
"228103012-0-59609";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-59610";"What do you know about Pridehome?"
"228103012-0-59611";"How is Nahfahlaar doing?"
"228103012-0-59612";"Yes, your mother found relief. The dreams should stop. She told me to tell you she loves you."
"228103012-0-59615";"Did Elden Root send you here to free Selene?"
"228103012-0-59616";"I'd like to review what we've learned so far."
"228103012-0-59617";"Are you all right, Aeliah?"
"228103012-0-59621";"It's a disguise. Sort of. This Auberic is expecting a well-dressed courier to deliver his token."
"228103012-0-59625";"Having doubts about this plan?"
"228103012-0-59627";"Do you know much about Dragons?"
"228103012-0-59629";"Like what?"
"228103012-0-59630";"Khamira invited the entire Dragonguard to Senchal?"
"228103012-0-59634";"I thought you're a nature spirit."
"228103012-0-59638";"And what mission are you and Caska currently on?"
"228103012-0-59652";"It's good to see you, too, Zamarak. Have you been here long?"
"228103012-0-59654";"Are you and the Cygnus Irregulars still working for Khamira?"
"228103012-0-59657";"It sounds like you're going to be very busy, Khamira."
"228103012-0-59658";"What's next for Sai Sahan?"
"228103012-0-59659";"Are you really upset that Khamira didn't mention you?"
"228103012-0-59670";"Tell me about the nature spirit."
"228103012-0-59672";"What about Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-59677";"I want to know more about you and your position."
"228103012-0-59678";"Tell me about the situation in Senchal."
"228103012-0-59706";"You seem to have some animosity toward Sai Sahan. Do you two have a history?"
"228103012-0-59708";"Tell me more about yourself and your crew."
"228103012-0-59713";"I want to join the Order of the New Moon."
"228103012-0-59717";"I'd rather take my own approach. Perhaps we should split from Za'ji and Caska."
"228103012-0-59719";"Do you coordinate all the Dragon hunts here?"
"228103012-0-59721";"I killed Turo."
"228103012-0-59723";"It seems Aeliah also wants to join in our Dragon hunt."
"228103012-0-59729";"The cultists are following?"
"228103012-0-59730";"That looks like a smuggler camp. You really think Maezi is down there?"
"228103012-0-59732";"I need to make paint with these ingredients. Any idea what they could be?"
"228103012-0-59736";"I'd like to know more about you."
"228103012-0-59737";"No, but a note I found tells us where they planned to take it."
"228103012-0-59742";"It's been awhile since I last saw you. Have you spoken with the other Companions lately?"
"228103012-0-59747";"Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"228103012-0-59751";"Do you think our companions are Dragonguard material?"
"228103012-0-59757";"I recovered the gourmet moon-sugar from the two drop points."
"228103012-0-59762";"Tell me about this plan of yours, Zhasim."
"228103012-0-59767";"We haven't spoken much. Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-59771";"Here's the rest of the gourmet moon-sugar."
"228103012-0-59772";"Why are you so sure you want to join the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-59776";"Tell me more about Dirge Truptor and Chizbari. Why might their talents interest me?"
"228103012-0-59781";"Tell me more about Laatvulon."
"228103012-0-59792";"Tell me about these sand-whales."
"228103012-0-59793";"Where are you off to next, Vigwenn?"
"228103012-0-59794";"Tender Claw is a thief?"
"228103012-0-59795";"How did you manage to corral all these terror birds?"
"228103012-0-59800";"Why do you and Safik want to leave South Guard?"
"228103012-0-59802";"Tell me about Khenarthi's Breath Temple."
"228103012-0-59803";"I want to hear more about this incident with Za'ji."
"228103012-0-59822";"Why are you so reluctant to talk about Turo?"
"228103012-0-59823";"Who is Antonia, eactly?"
"228103012-0-59826";"Yes, I destroyed all the totems. How do we dispel the magic on the locket?"
"228103012-0-59827";"Tell me more about these dreams. Are they always the same?"
"228103012-0-59830";"How are you and Za'ji getting along?"
"228103012-0-59831";"You expected otherwise?"
"228103012-0-59832";"Tell me more about this coven of witches. You mentioned pushing them into the sea?"
"228103012-0-59833";"What happened here, exactly?"
"228103012-0-59834";"Can you tell me more about the island?"
"228103012-0-59835";"Still hanging around Southern Elsweyr?"
"228103012-0-59836";"I thought you were heading north?"
"228103012-0-59837";"Weren't you and Daini heading north?"
"228103012-0-59838";"So you're not going to return to Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-59840";"How are things at Moonlit Cove?"
"228103012-0-59841";"Have you finished investigating the academy?"
"228103012-0-59843";"What manner of curse did the battlemage place on these weapons?"
"228103012-0-59845";"Why does your client want to settle the dead in the Forsaken Citadel?"
"228103012-0-59846";"What's so special about these lilies?"
"228103012-0-59847";"So, these mushrooms are just for cooking?"
"228103012-0-59848";"What more can you tell me about this new skooma?"
"228103012-0-59852";"What have you been up to, Sai?"
"228103012-0-59859";"What does springmint do?"
"228103012-0-59860";"Why would a Goutfang master steal rice?"
"228103012-0-59861";"What's special about this temple dust?"
"228103012-0-59862";"What's so important about this temple?"
"228103012-0-59863";"Has that guardian always been at the temple?"
"228103012-0-59864";"What's something?"
"228103012-0-59865";"It was no trouble."
"228103012-0-59866";"If you care about Lahini's safety, why refuse to help find her?"
"228103012-0-59872";"Anything you can tell me about this Reliquary of Stars?"
"228103012-0-59873";"Anything else you can tell me about the place this Akaviri soldier was buried?"
"228103012-0-59874";"What if the bandits already looted the grave?"
"228103012-0-59876";"You mentioned that Senchal was close to rioting. Did something happen?"
"228103012-0-59877";"The smugglers split the moon-sugar into three portions. Maezi and you will track the one in Senchal."
"228103012-0-59883";"I thought your relationship with Daini was just professional. Why the change of heart?"
"228103012-0-59885";"How long have you been with Za'ji's crew?"
"228103012-0-59886";"You think these Orcs will join the Order of the New Moon?"
"228103012-0-59887";"What should I do about Ethruin?"
"228103012-0-59888";"Are the Supernal Dreamers a threat?"
"228103012-0-59892";"What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-59895";"Remind me about our adventures in Anequina."
"228103012-0-59898";"My apologies, Caska. The New Moon Fortress. Remind me what we found there."
"228103012-0-59902";"Have you seen Za'ji and Aeliah lately?"
"228103012-0-59903";"We need to find the source of the aegis that protects this island."
"228103012-0-59908";"We'll do all we can."
"228103012-0-59909";"If the smugglers aren't driven out, won't the cove become polluted again?"
"228103012-0-59910";"Can you open the portal to the island?"
"228103012-0-59913";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-59916";"For a little bit of research, you seem to know a lot about this aeonstone."
"228103012-0-59918";"You still plan to soak in the springs?"
"228103012-0-59923";"Is that all you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-59925";"I found this note addressed to you along with this stone. It was next to a body."
"228103012-0-59926";"I didn't hear anything."
"228103012-0-59938";"The Dragon Vahlokzin stole it from the Dragonguard. Now we have it back."
"228103012-0-59945";"Yes. Nahfahlaar said the stone could absorb magical energy and amplify it."
"228103012-0-59948";"Just like old times, right?"
"228103012-0-59949";"What is the Wall of Life?"
"228103012-0-59950";"What is your relationship to Ka'ishka and Vijari?"
"228103012-0-59951";"What's Nahfahlaar doing here?"
"228103012-0-59953";"You were able to convince the other Dragons to stay away?"
"228103012-0-59958";"Laatvulon's cult is attacking a temple called Pridehome. Do you know why?"
"228103012-0-59960";"Vijari is your husband, right?"
"228103012-0-59961";"What can you tell me about the Wall of Life?"
"228103012-0-59962";"Adara'hai is your sister?"
"228103012-0-59968";"You were raised in a temple. You must know something about all this."
"228103012-0-59969";"Nahfahlaar mentioned the Pride of Alkosh. He said Laatvulon was afraid of them."
"228103012-0-59971";"What are we looking for?"
"228103012-0-59972";"You're home. Ka'ishka's here. Her sister is singing the Dusk-Canticles for you."
"228103012-0-59976";"We're still trying to figure that out."
"228103012-0-59989";"When will Abnur Tharn arrive?"
"228103012-0-59990";"When will Abnur Tharn arrive?"
"228103012-0-59991";"When will Abnur Tharn arrive?"
"228103012-0-59992";"Khunzar-ri said something about using the claw's power to walk the Jonelight Path."
"228103012-0-59998";"What brings you to the sanctum, general?"
"228103012-0-60002";"You seem eager to reach Dragonhold and take on Kaalgrontiid."
"228103012-0-60003";"I need to find a divine mask, buried alongside the hero Ja'darri."
"228103012-0-60004";"Are you ready to face Kaalgrontiid?"
"228103012-0-60020";"I found the pieces of the tablet."
"228103012-0-60024";"They're warriors born during the eclipse who are trained in Pridehome and protect time."
"228103012-0-60030";"Does the scroll you found mention anything about this mysterious ally of theirs?"
"228103012-0-60031";"Do you have any theories on what this ritual was supposed to accomplish?"
"228103012-0-60033";"How do you think King Jorunn will react to all this?"
"228103012-0-60037";"Have you found any other survivors?"
"228103012-0-60039";"What does that medallion do?"
"228103012-0-60045";"I'm not a cultist. Nomu sent me. He's waiting for you at the rendezvous spot. Head there now."
"228103012-0-60046";"I'm not a cultist. Nomu sent me to find you. He's waiting at the rendezvous spot. Head there now."
"228103012-0-60047";"How did you hear about aeonstone?"
"228103012-0-60054";"We've seen a lot of undead. Are all these witches necromancers?"
"228103012-0-60055";"How many witches are there on this island?"
"228103012-0-60057";"What have you been up to?"
"228103012-0-60058";"What have you been up to?"
"228103012-0-60059";"What have you been up to?"
"228103012-0-60060";"Are you hiring me to do something illegal?"
"228103012-0-60061";"If you're so known for your goods, why would it be bad if word got out about these deliveries?"
"228103012-0-60062";"You said your product spoils quickly?"
"228103012-0-60063";"You mentioned these goods would spoil?"
"228103012-0-60064";"Probably due to your depth perception, what with the eye patch and all."
"228103012-0-60065";"So you and Tender Claw are actual thieves?"
"228103012-0-60066";"Yes, I delivered the token. As for the Orc, it's a gift for Lady G."
"228103012-0-60069";"I'm taking part in the hunt. Here's my token."
"228103012-0-60071";"Who's the Red Beast?"
"228103012-0-60074";"The remedy is medicine?"
"228103012-0-60075";"Wait, this is medicine?"
"228103012-0-60076";"Wait, this is medicine?"
"228103012-0-60078";"I still have questions, Clan Mother."
"228103012-0-60091";"Why didn't you tell me your product was medicine?"
"228103012-0-60092";"I delivered your medicine just as you asked."
"228103012-0-60093";"I delivered your medicine just as you asked."
"228103012-0-60103";"Will Zhasim's uncle be upset if we can't recover the gourmet moon-sugar?"
"228103012-0-60108";"You think Zhasim's uncle will be all right with that?"
"228103012-0-60110";"So you're looking forward to traveling with Zhasim between here and Wrothgar?"
"228103012-0-60112";"Do you think you can actually establish a trade route between here and Wrothgar?"
"228103012-0-60119";"If they hadn't been ambushed, they wouldn't have needed my help."
"228103012-0-60122";"How did you get kidnapped anyway?"
"228103012-0-60125";"What can you tell me about your friends, Tajahir and Marekki?"
"228103012-0-60127";"So, do you know anything at all about this exhibition you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-60133";"What's the situation, Caska?"
"228103012-0-60137";"Focus, Za'ji. Why would your mother write a letter to Pridehome?"
"228103012-0-60139";"Your sister asked me to bring her to you. I found her in this sack."
"228103012-0-60142";"Excuse me?"
"228103012-0-60149";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-60150";"Do you know if Nahfahlaar is injured?"
"228103012-0-60154";"Are you and Marekki recovered from Lady Ghisiliane's hunt?"
"228103012-0-60156";"Have you been able to spot Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-60161";"Are you recovering from your ordeal?"
"228103012-0-60164";"Is it how you remember it?"
"228103012-0-60168";"What will you do with what you've learned?"
"228103012-0-60172";"Have you worked on a tapestry like this before?"
"228103012-0-60175";"Were you here when the tapestry was stolen?"
"228103012-0-60179";"What do you do for Captain Za'ji?"
"228103012-0-60180";"What do you do for Captain Za'ji?"
"228103012-0-60181";"You sailed on the Perfect Pounce before Za'ji was captain?"
"228103012-0-60182";"Is that what brought you to Senchal? Studying the Akaviri?"
"228103012-0-60183";"Why have you decided to join us now?"
"228103012-0-60191";"What aid can the Shields of Senchal offer our Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-60192";"How do you feel about our upcoming Dragon hunt?"
"228103012-0-60198";"How will the rest of the Shields accept your decision?"
"228103012-0-60201";"Tell me about the Undaunted Celebration."
"228103012-0-60203";"I had to kill Ra'khajin to get it, but I obtained the mask."
"228103012-0-60205";"Fighting Dragons? That must be exciting."
"228103012-0-60208";"I'd like to go over all that we've learned so far."
"228103012-0-60212";"I'd like to participate in your hunting expedition."
"228103012-0-60213";"This is your house?"
"228103012-0-60214";"You live in this house?"
"228103012-0-60215";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60216";"With the Cult gone, what will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60217";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60218";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"228103012-0-60219";"Do you three always travel together?"
"228103012-0-60220";"Where are you going next?"
"228103012-0-60221";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-60222";"Did you try to cheat this wood elf?"
"228103012-0-60230";"What do you do here on the waterfront?"
"228103012-0-60235";"Are you guarding the bank?"
"228103012-0-60238";"General Renmus did say that the Order of the New Moon was moving north."
"228103012-0-60241";"Do you know any love stories?"
"228103012-0-60242";"Do you know any stories about war?"
"228103012-0-60243";"Do you know any stories about strange places?"
"228103012-0-60251";"Are you worried about the Dragons?"
"228103012-0-60257";"How about a sad story?"
"228103012-0-60258";"Tell me a happy story."
"228103012-0-60269";"Tell me something scary."
"228103012-0-60270";"Do you know any stories about finding treasure?"

"228103012-0-60290";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-60291";"Have you ever faced a Dragon before?"
"228103012-0-60295";"Let's go over what we know about the Order of the New Moon."
"228103012-0-60296";"How do you think our Dragonguard will fare in this final battle?"
"228103012-0-60297";"How are you holding up, Aeliah?"
"228103012-0-60298";"Do you think we'll be defeated?"
"228103012-0-60299";"You seem more confidant than usual, Za'ji."
"228103012-0-60314";"Do you have an idea of how to get to the alcove?"
"228103012-0-60315";"Tell me more about this key and secret chamber."
"228103012-0-60327";"There was also a tapestry depicting Ja'darri with the Mask of Alkosh."
"228103012-0-60330";"Wait. Before we empower the mask, I have some questions."
"228103012-0-60352";"So you were always confident we would win?"
"228103012-0-60357";"That is what our order was formed to do."
"228103012-0-60361";"How are you, Caska?"
"228103012-0-60365";"How are you feeling after our victory?"
"228103012-0-60380";"Remind me what we're up against, Aeliah."
"228103012-0-60381";"Remind me what we're up against, Aeliah."
"228103012-0-60382";"What's your next step?"
"228103012-0-60394";"I'll head to Storm Talon Temple and meet you there. (Fast Travel to Stormhaven)"
"228103012-0-60395";"Let's head for Dark Water Temple right now. (Fast Travel to Eastmarch)"
"228103012-0-60396";"Let's head back to the abbey. (Fast Travel to Abbey of Blades)"
"228103012-0-60397";"What can you tell me about Caska?"
"228103012-0-60416";"You called me something several times now. Ahkahtuz. What does it mean?"
"228103012-0-60420";"I was looking for a piece of an old tapestry."
"228103012-0-60425";"Do you think your crew is up for the challenge of being part of the Dragonguard?"
"228103012-0-60428";"I wasn't told the cult's objective. Is there anyone who might know more?"
"228103012-0-60434";"How have things been otherwise?"
"228103012-0-60436";"Couldn't the Dragonguard use the same portal we did to reach Dragonhold?"
"228103012-0-60438";"Nahfahlaar challenged Laatvulon, but I don't know where they are."
"228103012-0-60446";"You're Lahini? Is your mother named Buzinda?"
"228103012-0-60448";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"228103012-0-60451";"I gathered these saliva covered bones for you."
"228103012-0-60455";"What can you tell me about Sand Whales?"
"228103012-0-60456";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60457";"What can you tell me about the Order of the New Moon?"
"228103012-0-60462";"Are you sure you want to join the Order of the New Moon?"
"228103012-0-60465";"Tell me more about the Black Kiergo Arena."
"228103012-0-60467";"Tell me more about the Order of the New Moon."
"228103012-0-60473";"Can you give me more details about this trial I must pass?"
"228103012-0-60477";"What happens now?"
"228103012-0-60484";"Does Daini care for a lot of people around here?"
"228103012-0-60485";"I'll keep her safe."
"228103012-0-60486";"How will these goods help you escape South Guard?"
"228103012-0-60490";"You're an exorcist?"
"228103012-0-60494";"Did you have any candidates in mind?"
"228103012-0-60500";"I'm sorry, but I found this note and stone next to a body. I believe it was J'saad's."
"228103012-0-60504";"My stomach is full of sacramental water and skooma. Now what?"
"228103012-0-60505";"What's keeping you so busy?"
"228103012-0-60507";"Will you be staying in Senchal for a while?"
"228103012-0-60511";"Can you tell me more about Ra'khajin?"
"228103012-0-60512";"Icereach? That island of witches we dealt with? What did you find out about their ritual and patron?"
"228103012-0-60514";"What about Nahfahlaar?"
"228103012-0-60517";"How did you learn about the Icereach Coven?"
"228103012-0-60519";"Are you some sort of performer?"
"228103012-0-60532";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-60535";"What have you been up to since we defeated Molag Bal?"
"228103012-0-60537";"How are you alive? I watched you sacrifice yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings!"
"228103012-0-60540";"There's something you need to know. Sai Sahan is alive."
"228103012-0-60543";"I'm ready to go. (Fast Travel to the Meeting Place)"
"228103012-0-60545";"How has being Khamira's Queen's Claw been?"
"228103012-0-60546";"Are you and the Cygnus Irregulars still working for Khamira?"
"228103012-0-60547";"What's the threat?"
"228103012-0-60551";"Can you remind me how the cleansing ritual works?"
"228103012-0-60555";"That's right. What brings you out here? Another exorcism?"
"228103012-0-60556";"So it's really over? We killed Kaalgrontiid?"
"228103012-0-60560";"How am I to infiltrate the cult?"
"228103012-0-60562";"I was told you needed help with something."
"228103012-0-60565";"What do we need to do?"
"228103012-0-60566";"Where are these dro-m'Athra coming from?"
"228103012-0-60568";"What about Ka'ishka?"
"228103012-0-60569";"Where are you headed next?"
"228103012-0-60570";"What happens to the dro-m'Athra when they die?"
"228103012-0-60574";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-60583";"Will you tell me about the magic provided by King Jorunn's wizards now?"
"228103012-0-60586";"The medallion led me to these burned bodies. I found this charred note on one of them."
"228103012-0-60589";"Were you able to accomplish anything while we were rescuing Fenn?"
"228103012-0-60590";"It was a long road to defeat Laatvulon."
"228103012-0-60594";"I found notes on werewolves and netherroot, and a potion made from netherroot and other ingredients."
"228103012-0-60598";"Where do you think we should look?"
"228103012-0-60603";"What should we expect to find at these Gray Host camps?"
"228103012-0-60605";"Closer?"
"228103012-0-60609";"Why do you think we can learn more at the center of the camp?"
"228103012-0-60610";"I'd like to know more about Ja'darri."
"228103012-0-60611";"You said you sensed another power in Elsweyr. Can you tell me more?"
"228103012-0-60612";"I found another note on a strange bloodfiend."
"228103012-0-60622";"What's next for the Shields of Senchal?"
"228103012-0-60624";"What kind of business is Sormund into, exactly?"
"228103012-0-60628";"What do you want me to do once he gets here?"
"228103012-0-60632";"Who's missing?"
"228103012-0-60633";"Bazler found me. Are you hurt?"
"228103012-0-60635";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60637";"How did you know where to find me?"
"228103012-0-60639";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-60640";"Narz sent me to look for you and the captain."
"228103012-0-60646";"What is this group you belong to?"
"228103012-0-60649";"Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"228103012-0-60650";"How do we determine why some bodies were exhumed and not others?"
"228103012-0-60653";"Tell me about this group you belong to."
"228103012-0-60664";"What else do I need to do?"
"228103012-0-60666";"I didn't kill him. He argued with a woman he called Sister Balra. She murdered him."
"228103012-0-60672";"Tell me what you found out."
"228103012-0-60676";"She kept you prisoner?"
"228103012-0-60677";"Are you sure you're up to talking to the high king?"
"228103012-0-60684";"Tell me how your mother would have handled that."
"228103012-0-60690";"This looks like the jar of refined brew we found in Tzinghalis's laboratory."
"228103012-0-60693";"What else do I need to do?"
"228103012-0-60695";"Have you had an opportunity to scout out the Gray Host camp?"
"228103012-0-60700";"You really think Solitude is in danger?"
"228103012-0-60703";"Why do we need a copy of the orders?"
"228103012-0-60704";"Tell me what you're thinking."
"228103012-0-60708";"I've obtained the specimens."
"228103012-0-60709";"Arkay's sacred oil?"
"228103012-0-60712";"We need some of Arkay's sacred oil."
"228103012-0-60715";"Tell me more about Castle Dour."
"228103012-0-60716";"The high priest said you took all of the sacred oil. The princess needs some of it."
"228103012-0-60718";"Tell me about this warding spell."
"228103012-0-60721";"Makob told me you were trapped in here."
"228103012-0-60726";"Why do you think Honoria left?"
"228103012-0-60728";"How do I destroy these totems?"
"228103012-0-60730";"What do you need Dragon spit for?"
"228103012-0-60732";"Dragons eat horses?"
"228103012-0-60733";"How fresh do these bones need to be?"
"228103012-0-60737";"How do you plan to test the elixir?"
"228103012-0-60746";"How is it you know so much about Dragons?"
"228103012-0-60757";"Everyone thinks you're dead. I'm seeking the cause of a curse turning people into zombies."
"228103012-0-60761";"Are you sure you're all right?"
"228103012-0-60769";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-60771";"Our old companion?"
"228103012-0-60774";"When will Abnur Tharn arrive?"
"228103012-0-60777";"Who's your friend?"
"228103012-0-60779";"Who are you talking to?"
"228103012-0-60782";"Were you expecting the place to be deserted?"
"228103012-0-60783";"The Icereach Coven can summon deadly magical storms. One storm already destroyed Kilkreath Temple."
"228103012-0-60786";"Tell me more about the witch sticks you said you found and destroyed."
"228103012-0-60790";"What are you talking about, Lyris?"
"228103012-0-60794";"How is everyone handling the loss of your crew members?"
"228103012-0-60799";"What did you see?"
"228103012-0-60803";"Tell me about draugr."
"228103012-0-60804";"Take me to Mournhold."
"228103012-0-60805";"Take me to Wayrest."
"228103012-0-60806";"Take me to Elden Root."
"228103012-0-60807";"I smashed a witch pike and freed some prisoners."
"228103012-0-60811";"We're going to have to face your father."
"228103012-0-60816";"Any idea where we're going to find the ritual site?"
"228103012-0-60817";"Who stabbed you?"
"228103012-0-60820";"How do we stop the harrowstorm?"
"228103012-0-60821";"You don't have to go with us."
"228103012-0-60823";"You think the sentry was telling the truth?"
"228103012-0-60826";"Are you ready to go back to Blackreach?"
"228103012-0-60830";"We should have expected an attack from Blackreach."
"228103012-0-60831";"That acolyte, she's just like Priest Direnna at the stables."
"228103012-0-60834";"Lyris and I uncovered a plot against Jorunn the Skald-King. We have to warn him."
"228103012-0-60837";"Did the storm cause your brethren to change?"
"228103012-0-60839";"Did he show any signs before he attacked you?"
"228103012-0-60840";"The Icereach Coven developed a ritual that turns people into a new kind of bloodfiend."
"228103012-0-60845";"Why can't King Jorunn just send us to Haafingar. Isn't he the High-King of Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-60848";"What do you think we saw down there?"
"228103012-0-60851";"A few of your soldiers escaped, but a harrowstorm claimed everyone in the barrow."
"228103012-0-60854";"What happened to Karthwatch?"
"228103012-0-60856";"Then let's get down there and do this."
"228103012-0-60859";"How do I find the ritual site?"
"228103012-0-60860";"How do we reach the catacombs?"
"228103012-0-60864";"The harrowstorm. It destroyed most of Karthwatch."
"228103012-0-60866";"Any new revelations in there?"
"228103012-0-60870";"Using the harrowstorms? How?"
"228103012-0-60873";"At least there are some survivors. What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-60875";"Svana and I are here to help. Tell me who you are and what happened here."
"228103012-0-60878";"I have the key."
"228103012-0-60880";"What are they doing with the harrowed?"
"228103012-0-60884";"Bone wolves?"
"228103012-0-60885";"Lyris and I saw soldiers herding the harrowed toward the Temple of the Divines."
"228103012-0-60894";"Fenn's message says he secured lodging on the south side."
"228103012-0-60896";"Is drinking your answer to everything?"
"228103012-0-60899";"<<1>>, your majesty."
"228103012-0-60903";"He was fleeing pursuit and gave me a bundle of papers before he died."
"228103012-0-60911";"Brondold said you might know something about the smuggled goods from Sentinel."
"228103012-0-60914";"What do you make of the notes and the key?"
"228103012-0-60915";"Why would your father send someone to bully Maugh?"
"228103012-0-60921";"Tell me more about the storm you saw."
"228103012-0-60924";"Do you remember anything else about these job postings?"
"228103012-0-60925";"Why the smuggler?"
"228103012-0-60927";"I'm looking for Fennorian. His notes said he was working with you."
"228103012-0-60939";"Your brother Fenrar sent me. He's concerned for your safety."
"228103012-0-60944";"Which way did they go?"
"228103012-0-60948";"What's special about Bjora?"
"228103012-0-60950";"Tell me how to get into the ruined Dwarven tower."
"228103012-0-60951";"Priest Bavian sent me. I'm here to help."
"228103012-0-60953";"Does Bjora know she's from the Reach?"
"228103012-0-60956";"How did you get free?"
"228103012-0-60964";"Maybe those blocks on the pedestals in front of the pillars do something?"
"228103012-0-60965";"What do you know of this place?"
"228103012-0-60968";"What's happened to you?"
"228103012-0-60971";"She said the witches revealed she's a queen of the Reach."
"228103012-0-60975";"Is that all you care about, Maugh? Fun?"
"228103012-0-60980";"What do I need to wear?"
"228103012-0-60983";"We killed the witches that entranced you."
"228103012-0-60984";"Actually, I arrived late. Has a musical instrument sold yet?"
"228103012-0-60990";"Can you tell me more about the Pyre Watch?"
"228103012-0-60991";"I saw you arguing with this vampire. He healed you?"
"228103012-0-60992";"Tell me about the attackers. Do you know anything about them?"
"228103012-0-60993";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-60994";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"228103012-0-60995";"Who are these Draugrkin, exactly?"
"228103012-0-60997";"Did you buy a musical instrument here?"
"228103012-0-61000";"We're friends. And we need your help to devise a defense against the harrowstorms."
"228103012-0-61005";"I suppose they will. I have the lute you wanted."
"228103012-0-61008";"So, you want me to find the other instruments that Nel pilfered?"
"228103012-0-61010";"What else do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-61014";"Do you have any guesses about what might lie ahead?"
"228103012-0-61015";"How are you holding up?"
"228103012-0-61016";"The Draugrkin are packing these urns with ashes and bones? Why?"
"228103012-0-61019";"You know Lyris?"
"228103012-0-61023";"I don't have any lockpicks."
"228103012-0-61024";"How do these traps work?"
"228103012-0-61027";"I came to tell you that they finished setting up the traps."
"228103012-0-61030";"The traps are placed."
"228103012-0-61033";"Why were you kicked out of the mine?"
"228103012-0-61034";"Proof of a plot against the high king. Care to explain what's in these crates?"
"228103012-0-61038";"Some sort of ritual, maybe?"
"228103012-0-61042";"What more can you tell me about this Blood Queen, Lady Essenia?"
"228103012-0-61043";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-61045";"Do you think that vampire really knows where Adusa is?"
"228103012-0-61049";"The lodge was empty, but I found a letter for the Breton. Orders to send the shipment to Kilkreath."
"228103012-0-61056";"I found proof that Captain Ageran was looking for the missing miners."
"228103012-0-61058";"I was sent to warn the temple priests."
"228103012-0-61077";"We'll take our chances. Now, tell us everything you know about Adusa."
"228103012-0-61083";"That's Fennorian of House Ravenwatch. He's investigating the Icereach Coven, just like us."
"228103012-0-61087";"What's wrong, Gwendis?"
"228103012-0-61090";"Should we tell Elle what we discovered?"
"228103012-0-61091";"Other fragments?"
"228103012-0-61094";"This proves Overseer Urlvar gave miners to a vampire in exchange for the mine's protection."
"228103012-0-61097";"Brondold isn't coming. He's dead."
"228103012-0-61098";"Are you all right, Gwendis?"
"228103012-0-61101";"I have some questions about your investigation."
"228103012-0-61102";"You don't look so good. Maybe you should turn back."
"228103012-0-61104";"Greymoor Keep?"
"228103012-0-61107";"Will you be able to make it back safely?"
"228103012-0-61116";"What happened to your wife?"
"228103012-0-61118";"Tell me what happened here."
"228103012-0-61120";"A priest said a vampire came this way. Is that what happened here?"
"228103012-0-61123";"How did an assassin get that close to the queen?"
"228103012-0-61127";"The caravan was destroyed. I found this arrow and a bottle of Markarth mead."
"228103012-0-61133";"It's not Jorunn you need to be concerned with. It's the Icereach Coven."
"228103012-0-61137";"We were gathering evidence to convince the high king of the threat to your kingdom."
"228103012-0-61146";"Why would you give them that information?"
"228103012-0-61154";"What can you tell me about this medallion?"
"228103012-0-61158";"Do you have anything that can trap him?"
"228103012-0-61166";"I see you found the vampire assassin."
"228103012-0-61168";"How do you intend to find this patron Kjalnar mentioned?"
"228103012-0-61169";"You did everything you could. It's a wonder you weren't affected by the harrowstorm."
"228103012-0-61170";"Do you really intend to rebuild the Pyre Watch?"
"228103012-0-61173";"Reachmen occupied her camp. She says they plan to destroy the bridge."
"228103012-0-61174";"Has Fennorian changed your view of vampires?"
"228103012-0-61186";"What did you hear?"
"228103012-0-61190";"Did Fenn inform you of our findings?"
"228103012-0-61192";"Ena sent me to find you."
"228103012-0-61195";"It's true, we have proof."
"228103012-0-61199";"Yes, the bridge is safe now."
"228103012-0-61200";"No sign of the vampire assassin yet."
"228103012-0-61202";"No one I spoke to has seen a man with an eye patch."
"228103012-0-61204";"How can they summon a storm underground?"
"228103012-0-61208";"They also mentioned an Ashen Lord."
"228103012-0-61212";"We tracked down and killed the queen's assassin."
"228103012-0-61216";"Here are your ancestor's remains."
"228103012-0-61223";"Are you in charge of Solitude now?"
"228103012-0-61225";"It looks like Solitude weathered the storm."
"228103012-0-61230";"How long had you served Svargrim?"
"228103012-0-61231";"I have no idea what's happening here."
"228103012-0-61232";"Svana's alive, but I can't say the same for the high king."
"228103012-0-61237";"Any word from your hold?"
"228103012-0-61238";"No one told me to expect the Skald-King."
"228103012-0-61239";"What are you and Skald-King Jorunn doing here?"
"228103012-0-61246";"You knew Princess Svana?"
"228103012-0-61247";"The Gray Host was behind the attacks on Western Skyrim. High King Svargrim … we had to kill him."
"228103012-0-61253";"Do you think Svana's ready to rule Western Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-61254";"I'm ready to depart now. (Fast Travel to Riften)"
"228103012-0-61259";"What can you tell me about this mine?"
"228103012-0-61261";"We killed Tzinghalis and brought back a map and a communique. The enemy calls itself the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-61266";"Bloodthirsty creatures?"
"228103012-0-61268";"So what do we do next?"
"228103012-0-61270";"So what do we do next?"
"228103012-0-61274";"The old wolf?"
"228103012-0-61278";"What do you think is happening here?"
"228103012-0-61279";"I was just going about my business when I saw that he was injured."
"228103012-0-61282";"I'm not here to hurt you. I need to talk to you about Brondold."
"228103012-0-61287";"Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-61292";"Careful, you're talking about the high king's daughter."
"228103012-0-61297";"I need lockpicks."
"228103012-0-61298";"What's the situation in Karthwatch now?"
"228103012-0-61300";"Fenn's message says he secured lodging on the south side."
"228103012-0-61301";"What did you see when the storm appeared?"
"228103012-0-61305";"Do Reachmen often take prisoners?"
"228103012-0-61309";"Why did you come to the barrow?"
"228103012-0-61310";"What did your ancestor do to deserve a traitor's burial?"
"228103012-0-61313";"Aren't you concerned for the survivors?"
"228103012-0-61316";"Remind me, how are we going to test the elixir?"
"228103012-0-61317";"What is the Midnight Barrow?"
"228103012-0-61318";"I heard about the mine collapse. What happened?"
"228103012-0-61321";"Why did you volunteer to be Fenn's test subject?"
"228103012-0-61326";"Do you want to put a stop to the test?"
"228103012-0-61329";"A journal from one of the miners. It seems something was hunting them."
"228103012-0-61337";"You think alchemy caused the mine collapse?"
"228103012-0-61343";"Who are the Draugrkin?"
"228103012-0-61344";"You think they were trying to hide where they came from?"
"228103012-0-61345";"What's the Reach?"
"228103012-0-61346";"Job postings?"
"228103012-0-61347";"The elixir works. Svana tested it herself and withstood a harrowstorm."
"228103012-0-61351";"Have you dealt with anything like this before?"
"228103012-0-61352";"Where is Morthal?"
"228103012-0-61353";"What makes you think Old Mjolen can help?"
"228103012-0-61356";"I took the meat to the camp, just like you asked."
"228103012-0-61359";"<Pet Pickle> Good boy."
"228103012-0-61360";"Where will I find your ship?"
"228103012-0-61362";"Why did they send you out here?"
"228103012-0-61365";"Yes, I have it."
"228103012-0-61366";"Job postings?"
"228103012-0-61369";"I found this medallion nearby, beneath a broken window."
"228103012-0-61373";"Were you with the mining party?"
"228103012-0-61376";"I found one of the miners. He says that the creatures captured his friends."
"228103012-0-61378";"Why is there bad blood between High King Svargrim and Jorunn the Skald-King?"
"228103012-0-61379";"What sort of proof will persuade High King Svargrim to listen?"
"228103012-0-61380";"A soldier accused me of being a spy. Are your people always so suspicious?"
"228103012-0-61381";"Can you explain what this is all about?"
"228103012-0-61382";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-61383";"How do we know the smugglers and Reachmen are even connected?"
"228103012-0-61384";"Tell me about this tunnel collapse."
"228103012-0-61386";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-61388";"What caused all this destruction?"
"228103012-0-61393";"That letter indicated that the coven was using the miners for various purposes."
"228103012-0-61394";"How do you feel?"
"228103012-0-61399";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-61404";"He stayed behind to distract the creatures."
"228103012-0-61406";"How did you escape from those creatures?"
"228103012-0-61407";"Do you think Mugha survived?"
"228103012-0-61408";"Mugha, right? What happened here?"
"228103012-0-61412";"I was sent to warn the temple priests. I'm looking into the coven for Queen Gerhyld."
"228103012-0-61417";"Wait, what are you giving me?"
"228103012-0-61428";"Watching your mother die in front of you must have been devastating. Do you need some time?"
"228103012-0-61434";"You said I'm saving the Bards College?"
"228103012-0-61437";"Tell me about this instrument you want me to recover."
"228103012-0-61439";"Mugha survived, but the others didn't. Mazog altered the stonemelt recipe and caused the collapse."
"228103012-0-61448";"Are you really High King Svargrim's daughter?"
"228103012-0-61449";"I met a priest outside. He said you needed assistance."
"228103012-0-61452";"Mazog altered the recipe to try and take the strain off the miners."
"228103012-0-61457";"What kind of punishment will Mazog receive for causing the cave-in?"
"228103012-0-61462";"We can do this, Svana. We have to at least try."
"228103012-0-61465";"Can you tell me anything else about the Breton and the laborers?"
"228103012-0-61466";"Do you know what they're doing in there? We need to get inside."
"228103012-0-61475";"I'm here about the notice. What sort of work are you offering?"
"228103012-0-61479";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-61481";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-61482";"Tell me about the Draugr you mentioned."
"228103012-0-61483";"Is there anything you can tell me about Chillwind Depths?"
"228103012-0-61484";"Do you really believe these berries can bestow the strength of a Giant?"
"228103012-0-61493";"Bloodfiends? I came to warn the temple about Reachmen."
"228103012-0-61494";"I want to hear about House Ravenwatch."
"228103012-0-61495";"Aren't you a vampire?"
"228103012-0-61496";"What exactly happened at Kilkreath Temple?"
"228103012-0-61506";"It sounds like you've lost your faith."
"228103012-0-61512";"A view of blue with me and you."
"228103012-0-61513";"A jewel of blue rules the view."
"228103012-0-61514";"A jewel of blue cues virtue."
"228103012-0-61515";"A drake of grey survives some way."
"228103012-0-61516";"A day away makes a drake grey."
"228103012-0-61517";"A drake of grey survives the day."
"228103012-0-61518";"We can't make more elixir without the sacred oil, right?"
"228103012-0-61519";"Are you all right? Your father's revelation seemed to hit you pretty hard."
"228103012-0-61520";"What do you think is really going on here?"
"228103012-0-61521";"Your mistress wants you to give me the lute."
"228103012-0-61525";"I heard there's a sickness spreading."
"228103012-0-61529";"How will I know Nelfthea when I see her?"
"228103012-0-61530";"No, she died fighting off invading Giants that attacked the coast."
"228103012-0-61534";"Who was she talking to?"
"228103012-0-61537";"Calm down and tell me who you are and what happened to you."
"228103012-0-61542";"And the other guy?"
"228103012-0-61544";"Tell me about your sister."
"228103012-0-61545";"Tell me more about the ingredients you need."
"228103012-0-61548";"What else can you tell me about Chillwind Depths?"
"228103012-0-61549";"I only hope it's not too late to save your sister."
"228103012-0-61556";"What did you say this place was called?"
"228103012-0-61559";"Your sister asked me to check on you."
"228103012-0-61561";"Have you uncovered anything we can use to halt these storms?"
"228103012-0-61562";"Who is this ally she was talking about?"
"228103012-0-61563";"Do I know you?"
"228103012-0-61567";"What about the Icereach Coven medallions? They seemed to protect Fridelja in Karthwatch."
"228103012-0-61570";"Raynor? How did you get here?"
"228103012-0-61575";"I have the parts. I saw some strange things …."
"228103012-0-61578";"Have you and your father never gotten along?"
"228103012-0-61580";"What can you tell me about Chief Urzikh?"
"228103012-0-61581";"Who is Overseer Thulsgreg?"
"228103012-0-61583";"Why do you dislike Chief Urzikh so much?"
"228103012-0-61586";"Are you all right with all this, Svana?"
"228103012-0-61589";"What else can you tell me about this sickness?"
"228103012-0-61596";"The assassin killed more people as he fled out the city gate. A priest identified him as a vampire."
"228103012-0-61603";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-61604";"Is splitting up really a good idea?"
"228103012-0-61605";"Do you really need to know why your father betrayed his kingdom?"
"228103012-0-61606";"What did we just witness, Fenn?"
"228103012-0-61608";"How do we find Svargrim?"
"228103012-0-61609";"What happens when we find Svargrim?"
"228103012-0-61610";"Svana, about your father …."
"228103012-0-61611";"This tunnel leads to the surface?"
"228103012-0-61612";"Do we have a plan?"
"228103012-0-61614";"I don't understand why Svargrim hasn't unleashed the harrowstorm yet."
"228103012-0-61615";"What's the quickest way up there?"
"228103012-0-61616";"Are you able to fight?"
"228103012-0-61617";"How are you going to fight them all?"
"228103012-0-61618";"What's causing these stone husks to animate?"
"228103012-0-61619";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-61620";"I was told you wanted to talk to me."
"228103012-0-61625";"You might want to get someplace safe until this is over."
"228103012-0-61627";"Why do you think eating the same food that the giants eat would give us their strength?"
"228103012-0-61631";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-61632";"Who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-61637";"She gave me keys to investigate the offices."
"228103012-0-61640";"What just happened here?"
"228103012-0-61641";"Your grandfather's notes imply some kind of sacred mission."
"228103012-0-61646";"What are these traps supposed to catch?"
"228103012-0-61647";"Whoever extinguished the other fires might have tampered with it."
"228103012-0-61655";"Not well. The Icereach Coven assassinated Queen Gerhyld. Now Svargrim distrusts us even more."
"228103012-0-61658";"Here are the wolf bones and deathbell you asked for."
"228103012-0-61664";"I have some questions before we set out."
"228103012-0-61669";"You're a prisoner down here?"
"228103012-0-61672";"I'm looking for someone who wears a patch over his left eye."
"228103012-0-61676";"We should find Lyris first."
"228103012-0-61679";"Can you tell me more about the Mining Consortium?"
"228103012-0-61680";"How did you get into this line of work?"
"228103012-0-61691";"What do you think we're dealing with here?"
"228103012-0-61693";"I found this note from Ena to someone named Ulang."
"228103012-0-61699";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"228103012-0-61710";"Why are you here with the Jarl of Whiterun?"
"228103012-0-61711";"Tell me more about your mission."
"228103012-0-61729";"Why do you dislike Overseer Thulsgreg so much?"
"228103012-0-61730";"Undead wolves attacked Havil's farm. And he saw Freiwen's ghost. He thought you could help."
"228103012-0-61742";"So what now?"
"228103012-0-61743";"You really think there's something beside the Gray Host buried here?"
"228103012-0-61745";"Tell me more about the island."
"228103012-0-61746";"Yes, I'm here to defend Kyne's Aegis."
"228103012-0-61750";"Bring me a foe worth fighting!"
"228103012-0-61760";"What are you doing down here, Kireth?"
"228103012-0-61767";"Why do you oppose the chief?"
"228103012-0-61769";"What's with the dead body behind you?"
"228103012-0-61770";"What have you been up to, anyway?"
"228103012-0-61771";"Where did Kireth and Raynor go?"
"228103012-0-61775";"Why are the thanes feuding?"
"228103012-0-61777";"Tell me about Thane Hraldi and Thane Svyne."
"228103012-0-61783";"Where should we look for this mushroom?"
"228103012-0-61789";"Any idea what's attacking the miners?"
"228103012-0-61793";"Freiwen is still alive. But her curse will kill her soon. She asked me to give you this locket."
"228103012-0-61798";"I found some ritual notes and a broken focus."
"228103012-0-61801";"Why did Havil call you a clever woman?"
"228103012-0-61804";"Can't the two of you put your feud aside?"
"228103012-0-61818";"Are you angry with your grandfather for keeping this from you?"
"228103012-0-61824";"How did you learn about this solution?"
"228103012-0-61828";"Chief Urzikh seems pretty confident it will work."
"228103012-0-61836";"Tell me about these Sea Giants."
"228103012-0-61839";"Tell me more about Kyne's Aegis."
"228103012-0-61840";"What else do you know about Lord Falgravn?"
"228103012-0-61845";"What do you think Essenia did to these vampires?"
"228103012-0-61847";"Why would Essenia do this to her own kind?"
"228103012-0-61850";"<Add Ingredients to Solution.>"
"228103012-0-61866";"What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-61868";"I assaulted the Stone Garden and ended the madness within."
"228103012-0-61870";"What vampire threat? Why are you two here?"
"228103012-0-61871";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-61872";"I stormed Castle Thorn and eliminated the Thorn Legion."
"228103012-0-61895";"I overheard Ironbelly tell the witch that the fliers were distributed. I found one on his body."
"228103012-0-61903";"The thanes put aside their differences. They agreed to meet with you and Rigurt."
"228103012-0-61939";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-61940";"Could you talk to the high king about this threat? He might listen to you."
"228103012-0-61941";"Did you get a good look at the assassin?"
"228103012-0-61944";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-61945";"Do you know where your missing miners might have gone?"
"228103012-0-61946";"You don't think the Blue Palace is safe?"
"228103012-0-61949";"Is Vhysradue really an Akaviri warrior?"
"228103012-0-61952";"Where are Kireth and Raynor?"
"228103012-0-61955";"What happened to you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-61957";"You don't remember anything?"
"228103012-0-61959";"Why are there refugees in Blackreach?"
"228103012-0-61960";"What's so special about these power nodes?"
"228103012-0-61961";"What does the master scepter do?"
"228103012-0-61962";"What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-61964";"Before we go, let's review what we already learned about the coven's plans."
"228103012-0-61976";"What do you think caused the mine collapse?"
"228103012-0-61978";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"228103012-0-61979";"Who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-61991";"Lyris is in Solitude. I thought you tried to avoid large cities?"
"228103012-0-61992";"Did Fenn tell you what we've learned?"
"228103012-0-61994";"You mentioned that your research included the Blackreach legends. Anything we should know?"
"228103012-0-61995";"You really think we should split up?"
"228103012-0-61997";"Strange sticks?"
"228103012-0-61999";"Why not speak to Svana yourself?"
"228103012-0-62002";"So you haven't seen or heard about anything suspicious going on down here?"
"228103012-0-62004";"How did you get involved with this mining operation?"
"228103012-0-62005";"What can you tell me about these attacks?"
"228103012-0-62009";"Have you seen any locations where bandits could hide down here?"
"228103012-0-62012";"What happened with the horde of harrowfiends?"
"228103012-0-62015";"What about the harrowfiends?"
"228103012-0-62016";"What about Old Mageka? She'll want to know about the people we rescued."
"228103012-0-62017";"Svargrim's dead and Svana's fine, but she needed a moment. She asked me to check on you."
"228103012-0-62020";"What happened with the horde of harrowfiends?"
"228103012-0-62021";"What do you think we'll find at the Grinning Horker?"
"228103012-0-62026";"Tell me about Kilkreath Temple."
"228103012-0-62035";"Did you know the Skald-King was coming?"
"228103012-0-62036";"What do you need?"
"228103012-0-62040";"What about your guests?"
"228103012-0-62041";"What should we do now, Svana?"
"228103012-0-62044";"Meaning what?"
"228103012-0-62050";"Any ideas on where we can get more netherroot?"
"228103012-0-62051";"Why is that?"
"228103012-0-62052";"Tell me about Karthald."
"228103012-0-62059";"They're making it as we speak, but he says they'll need more netherroot soon."
"228103012-0-62062";"What have you and your crew been up to since we last met?"
"228103012-0-62063";"What will you do after all this?"
"228103012-0-62064";"What will happen to Kilkreath Temple?"
"228103012-0-62065";"You appear to be in good spirits."
"228103012-0-62066";"What will become of Karthald?"
"228103012-0-62067";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-62068";"What is the Ravenwatch planning?"
"228103012-0-62069";"Will you be staying in Skyrim for a while?"
"228103012-0-62071";"What will you and Phebe do after this?"
"228103012-0-62072";"What will you and Claudina do next?"
"228103012-0-62073";"How is Mor Khazgur?"
"228103012-0-62074";"How are things in Mor Khazgur?"
"228103012-0-62075";"What will you do after this?"
"228103012-0-62076";"What will you do after this?"
"228103012-0-62077";"How is the garrison holding up?"
"228103012-0-62078";"Which is?"
"228103012-0-62079";"How have things been in Dragon Bridge?"
"228103012-0-62080";"How are you feeling?"
"228103012-0-62082";"How have things been in Morthal?"
"228103012-0-62083";"Do you think you can hold the village?"
"228103012-0-62084";"What can I expect to find up ahead?"
"228103012-0-62085";"Can you explain what this is all about?"
"228103012-0-62090";"Will you be leaving Western Skyrim now?"
"228103012-0-62091";"What are you going to do now, King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-62092";"Do you think Eastern and Western Skyrim might reconcile?"
"228103012-0-62093";"What are you doing here, King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-62094";"Do you think Svana is ready to become the ruler of Western Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-62095";"Are you here to take over the Reach?"
"228103012-0-62096";"Svana was impressive. She really stepped up when her kingdom needed her."
"228103012-0-62097";"What happened to you before you found this place?"
"228103012-0-62102";"Who are these people?"
"228103012-0-62103";"Fenrar established a safe camp in the ruins below Karthwatch."
"228103012-0-62110";"How exactly did you wind up like this?"
"228103012-0-62115";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-62116";"Tell me about your caravan agent."
"228103012-0-62118";"What of the other afflicted?"
"228103012-0-62122";"I was wondering, how do you communicate with the palace from down here?"
"228103012-0-62123";"What do you mean, it rests on Fenn's shoulders?"
"228103012-0-62124";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-62125";"What are you doing with the harrowed?"
"228103012-0-62136";"Rigurt the Brash sent me. He needs the howlwater."
"228103012-0-62139";"Why is Solitude ignoring you?"
"228103012-0-62142";"What exactly is howlwater?"
"228103012-0-62144";"Ena lives in town but has camps up here?"
"228103012-0-62147";"How do you know these people?"
"228103012-0-62148";"I have it right here."
"228103012-0-62150";"What's he planning to do with your soldiers?"
"228103012-0-62151";"Tell me about Ulang."
"228103012-0-62152";"What did you do to offend her, Narsis?"
"228103012-0-62157";"You said they threatened Ulang. Where is he now?"
"228103012-0-62158";"You were working with the Reachmen?"
"228103012-0-62163";"What will it take for you to attend the meeting at Jarl Morryn's lodge?"
"228103012-0-62166";"I'd like to see the last journal of Maelmoth the Mysterious."
"228103012-0-62171";"What were the side entrances used for?"
"228103012-0-62173";"Yes, she let me borrow the journal."
"228103012-0-62178";"What should we expect the medallion to do?"
"228103012-0-62179";"Any idea where you're going next?"
"228103012-0-62181";"Are you sure you're able to conduct this meeting?"
"228103012-0-62182";"Do you think Solitude will finally provide the supplies you need?"
"228103012-0-62185";"You said you'll bury this place?"
"228103012-0-62186";"Why didn't the librarian let you borrow Maelmoth's journal?"
"228103012-0-62190";"Before we go inside, I have some questions."
"228103012-0-62191";"xxx"
"228103012-0-62192";"xxx"
"228103012-0-62193";"xxx"
"228103012-0-62194";"xxx"
"228103012-0-62198";"Lieutenant Korleva thought you could use some help."
"228103012-0-62213";"What are we going to do in Karthwatch?"
"228103012-0-62215";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-62216";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-62218";"You're sure that's the same vampire from the Blue Palace?"
"228103012-0-62227";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-62228";"Tell me what you know about the abyssal geysers."
"228103012-0-62230";"Do you think you can get Jarl Reddharn to listen to us?"
"228103012-0-62231";"What do you plan to do while you're waiting for the Skald-King?"
"228103012-0-62232";"So let's go to Haafingar and deal with the coven."
"228103012-0-62236";"When will your palace be completed?"
"228103012-0-62237";"Tell me more about Viggol."
"228103012-0-62238";"You really think there's an alternate route into the keep?"
"228103012-0-62239";"Any idea what the Gray Host's plans for Stone Garden are?"
"228103012-0-62241";"The riddle mentions flowers. What do you make of it?"
"228103012-0-62242";"What can you tell me about Arkasis?"
"228103012-0-62247";"I'm sure Svana could use more help right now."
"228103012-0-62250";"The riddle seems to focus on flowers and numbers."
"228103012-0-62255";"How are you going to make your father listen?"
"228103012-0-62264";"I will help clear a path."
"228103012-0-62274";"The riddle deals with doors."
"228103012-0-62278";"Can you tell me more about this Pale Man?"
"228103012-0-62279";"Yes, I have."
"228103012-0-62282";"Why do you want me to talk to these people?"
"228103012-0-62284";"You said something happened to your legs?"
"228103012-0-62289";"Aerolf sent me to hear your story about the Pale Man."
"228103012-0-62293";"Do you have any idea what door is correct?"
"228103012-0-62294";"Aerolf sent me to ask you about the Pale Man."
"228103012-0-62299";"Do you think Fenn's disappearance is related to whatever drew him to Blackreach?"
"228103012-0-62306";"They both saw the Pale Man past the mountains on the coast, north of Solitude and Dragon Bridge."
"228103012-0-62308";"How did it elude you before?"
"228103012-0-62312";"Why do we need to assemble a draugr?"
"228103012-0-62314";"You mentioned dousing the body with alchemy?"
"228103012-0-62317";"How do we find the Pale Man's lair?"
"228103012-0-62323";"I got what you asked for. What now?"
"228103012-0-62327";"What have you discovered so far?"
"228103012-0-62331";"The monster you called the Pale Man is dead."
"228103012-0-62335";"It appears to be a practical joke. Touching it unlocked the door to the Mysterium!"
"228103012-0-62338";"Pack mates. That's an interesting turn of phrase."
"228103012-0-62340";"Tell me about Tzinghalis."
"228103012-0-62341";"The book mentioned several items, but that bottle seemed especially important."
"228103012-0-62346";"What were you and Fenn doing before he disappeared?"
"228103012-0-62348";"Svana is fine. She handled herself well down there."
"228103012-0-62351";"I thought the high king agreed to help the holds?"
"228103012-0-62354";"Princess Svana has a plan to help the people."
"228103012-0-62355";"Can you find Viggol?"
"228103012-0-62358";"Why doesn't your father want us in Castle Dour?"
"228103012-0-62361";"Have you picked up Viggol's trail, boy?"
"228103012-0-62364";"Tell me more about the Dragon Cult."
"228103012-0-62367";"How did the Gray Host get a large force inside the city walls?"
"228103012-0-62370";"Will you and Rigurt get the thanes to agree to a treaty?"
"228103012-0-62371";"The Antiquarian Circle?"
"228103012-0-62374";"Jarl Reddharn sent us. He said he hasn't heard from the soldiers he sent to the barrow."
"228103012-0-62375";"Can you tell me what happened in there earlier?"
"228103012-0-62376";"Did you know Freiwen?"
"228103012-0-62379";"Let's find out. How does it work?"
"228103012-0-62382";"Why can't you teach me how to use the Eye?"
"228103012-0-62384";"I didn't kill him. He argued with a woman he called Sister Balra. She murdered him."
"228103012-0-62385";"What can you tell me about the Dragon Cult?"
"228103012-0-62388";"Why these particular Dragon Mounds?"
"228103012-0-62390";"What can you tell me about the Antiquarian's Eye?"
"228103012-0-62391";"What is the goal of the Antiquarian Circle, exactly?"
"228103012-0-62392";"What is the University of Gwylim?"
"228103012-0-62394";"Do you dislike Chief Urzikh?"
"228103012-0-62395";"Yes, I have them."
"228103012-0-62399";"Why didn't you tell me your plan earlier?"
"228103012-0-62402";"We won't know until we're closer."
"228103012-0-62405";"Do you really think Dragons could threaten Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-62408";"Then drop the barrier and let's finish this."
"228103012-0-62410";"Let's go."
"228103012-0-62411";"What have you been doing since we last met?"
"228103012-0-62418";"Tell me what you think you figured out."
"228103012-0-62423";"Follow me back to the road."
"228103012-0-62424";"The Antiquarian Circle?"
"228103012-0-62428";"I belong to the Antiquarian Circle. I'm not sure I remember seeing you."
"228103012-0-62434";"What should I do next?"
"228103012-0-62435";"Is there any way to test it?"
"228103012-0-62437";"Trust yourself. If you think your theory is correct, let others know."
"228103012-0-62438";"Caution is best. Tell Gabrielle what you've done, but don't jump to conclusions."
"228103012-0-62441";"How should I decide what antiquities to pursue?"
"228103012-0-62442";"What kinds of objects will I find out there?"
"228103012-0-62443";"Where are you headed next?"
"228103012-0-62444";"What will happen to Stone Garden?"
"228103012-0-62445";"Where will you and your pack go?"
"228103012-0-62447";"How did you and Fenn cross paths?"
"228103012-0-62453";"I've been tasked by the Swords of Solitude to deal with the Giant you encountered."
"228103012-0-62458";"The Swords of Solitude sent me. Can you tell me anything about the werewolves that took your goats?"
"228103012-0-62461";"We'll all go. Tell me what you heard."
"228103012-0-62471";"What are you going to do now, King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-62472";"What are you doing here, King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-62473";"Are you here to take over the Reach?"
"228103012-0-62475";"I found another survivor. He told me to look for you."
"228103012-0-62477";"Can you tell me more about this Khajiit?"
"228103012-0-62478";"Why did you go with Captain Mavvok?"
"228103012-0-62479";"Do you have any idea what took your crew members?"
"228103012-0-62480";"What's your business in Solitude?"
"228103012-0-62482";"There's nowhere else you can get the sacred oil?"
"228103012-0-62483";"You have a pet mammoth?"
"228103012-0-62484";"Maybe she's too far away to hear you."
"228103012-0-62488";"Do you think we can we trust Svargrim's swordthane?"
"228103012-0-62490";"I'd love a drink."
"228103012-0-62492";"I'm not interested."
"228103012-0-62497";"You don't have to do this if you're not feeling up to it."
"228103012-0-62500";"I've been tasked with proving Skreg is a cheat and defeating him."
"228103012-0-62503";"How did you get here before I did?"
"228103012-0-62505";"I would have thought this was Rada al-Saran's castle."
"228103012-0-62506";"Where should we start our search?"
"228103012-0-62515";"What's next for you and Telline?"
"228103012-0-62516";"[Lie] I don't know anything about Blackreach."
"228103012-0-62518";"I've been to Blackreach. Look for a massive Dwarven lift and head down."
"228103012-0-62520";"I'll take a look. [Take the Book]"
"228103012-0-62521";"I'm not interested. [Refuse the Book]"
"228103012-0-62526";"What did you see?"
"228103012-0-62528";"Fenn found Tzinghalis's notes. They turned the entire keep into a witch pike."
"228103012-0-62530";"Can you really do that?"
"228103012-0-62531";"Whatever is necessary? Are you sure about that?"
"228103012-0-62532";"I hear your husband is tracking creatures in the mine."
"228103012-0-62535";"Any idea how we find Svargrim?"
"228103012-0-62539";"Are skeevers safe to eat?"
"228103012-0-62543";"Do you think this amulet really calmed the storm?"
"228103012-0-62544";"What do you think is actually going on here?"
"228103012-0-62548";"Why won't they speak with you?"
"228103012-0-62549";"We're just trying to find Alchemist Rasir."
"228103012-0-62553";"So they're using vampire dust to turn people into these fiends?"
"228103012-0-62558";"Have you seen Skor at all?"
"228103012-0-62560";"Do you think he could have survived something like that?"
"228103012-0-62563";"You don't believe in the supernatural?"
"228103012-0-62573";"How did you escape?"
"228103012-0-62576";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-62580";"Can you explain what this is all about?"
"228103012-0-62582";"Before we get on with this investigation, I'd like to catch up with you for a bit."
"228103012-0-62589";"I was sent to warn the temple priests and find evidence of the Icereach Coven for the queen."
"228103012-0-62591";"<<1>> said you could tell me about the Shademother."
"228103012-0-62607";"I have the cure."
"228103012-0-62612";"What can you tell me about the Shadowgreen?"
"228103012-0-62613";"I collected the energy we need."
"228103012-0-62620";"What are your plans going forward?"
"228103012-0-62621";"Will you take over as High Queen?"
"228103012-0-62622";"Do you think Svargrim passed on to Sovngarde?"
"228103012-0-62627";"Tell me more about your experiment."
"228103012-0-62632";"Do you have a copy of the sonnet? I seem to have lost mine."
"228103012-0-62634";"Tell me what you know about these vampires."
"228103012-0-62638";"Yes. Verita said you can use it better than anyone."
"228103012-0-62641";"Can we go over excavation again?"
"228103012-0-62643";"What exactly is a Dissonance Apparatus?"
"228103012-0-62644";"Could you remind me how the Antiquarian's Eye works?"
"228103012-0-62645";"Can you tell me anything more about Midnight Barrow?"
"228103012-0-62649";"I have been tasked with assisting your studies."
"228103012-0-62657";"How do I operate the Dissonance Apparatus?"
"228103012-0-62658";"The Coterie tasked me with assisting your research."

"228103012-0-63003";"I've been to Karthwatch, princess. We're too late. A harrowstorm has already destroyed the town."

"228103012-0-63007";"How badly are you hurt?"
"228103012-0-63011";"Should we ask Jarl Morryn for advice?"
"228103012-0-63012";"If we catch Old Hjaalsdottir, will you attend Jarl Morryn's meeting?"
"228103012-0-63013";"Who is your husband?"

"228103012-0-63067";"You'll support her then?"
"228103012-0-63068";"Will you be returning to Morthal?"
"228103012-0-63069";"Did the other refugees lock you out of the grotto?"
"228103012-0-63070";"Why?"
"228103012-0-63073";"Your wife sent me to help. Tell me what happened."
"228103012-0-63074";"Mother Lamae, would you tell me more about the gifts you've given me?"
"228103012-0-63077";"Both. Why?"
"228103012-0-63079";"You know, I think you should just hand the meat over."
"228103012-0-63082";"I have your kiviaq."
"228103012-0-63084";"What's so special about Solitude's walls?"
"228103012-0-63088";"You heard whispers and saw spirits?"
"228103012-0-63090";"Then we should search Tzinghalis's Sanctum."
"228103012-0-63096";"Remind me, what are we doing here again?"
"228103012-0-63097";"Why are the Ravenwatch here in Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-63102";"Who are you, by the way?"
"228103012-0-63107";"Did Magister Fridelja learn anything that might help us?"

"228103012-0-63115";"Did you make contact with your Ravenwatch allies?"
"228103012-0-63118";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-63119";"You seem tense."
"228103012-0-63122";"Are you a priest from the Temple of the Divines?"
"228103012-0-63128";"I would have thought this was Rada al-Saran's castle."
"228103012-0-63129";"Svana, about your father …."
"228103012-0-63130";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-63131";"Do you plan to stay in the smuggling and black market business?"
"228103012-0-63132";"So you're done dealing with the Reach?"
"228103012-0-63138";"Could it have something to do with the ritual I saw the witch perform at the barrow?"
"228103012-0-63150";"Can we talk about the situation in Morthal?"
"228103012-0-63151";"Why does this town have a garrison?"

"228103012-0-63170";"How do we stop it?"
"228103012-0-63174";"Do you think the danger has passed?"
"228103012-0-63184";"Those urns from Bangkorai you mentioned earlier. What's so special about them?"
"228103012-0-63186";"What will the chief do to her when she finds out?"
"228103012-0-63194";"Sorry, what's a … Salskap?"
"228103012-0-63198";"I explored part of the castle with Gwendis to stop a Gray Host experiment."
"228103012-0-63201";"Brondold isn't coming. He's dead."
"228103012-0-63210";"Why did Maxten curse you in this way?"
"228103012-0-63214";"I'm here to join the Antiquarian Circle."
"228103012-0-63215";"That's an unusual chair."
"228103012-0-63220";"Why do you call yourself an eccentric?"
"228103012-0-63224";"What brings you to the Gwylim Annex here in Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-63227";"Anything else you can tell me about the Frozen Coast?"
"228103012-0-63228";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-63240";"How did you make it out?"
"228103012-0-63241";"Well met. And you are?"
"228103012-0-63248";"What exactly happened at Kilkreath Temple?"
"228103012-0-63249";"Evska mentioned you are married to Jarl Reddharn."
"228103012-0-63253";"We should talk about Jarl Hagridden."
"228103012-0-63262";"You said Freiwen enjoyed visiting the farm?"
"228103012-0-63265";"Tell me more about Old Mjolen."
"228103012-0-63275";"Tell me more about this protection rune you gave me."
"228103012-0-63284";"So, you're a warrior?"
"228103012-0-63291";"Do we have enough evidence to convince the king and queen of the danger?"
"228103012-0-63293";"Have any advice for me?"
"228103012-0-63294";"Why can't you go to the auction yourself?"
"228103012-0-63295";"Who are you, again?"
"228103012-0-63299";"How did you get into the antiquity hunting business?"
"228103012-0-63301";"Edjar can lead us to Fenn, but first we need to fulfill the bargain Fenn made with him."
"228103012-0-63308";"How do you like Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-63310";"I found this letter next to a man passed out from mead. It says you need help."
"228103012-0-63316";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-63318";"What do you think happened to the miners?"
"228103012-0-63323";"I saw a memory where you called Maxten your love."
"228103012-0-63336";"What will you do about those creatures still stalking the mine?"
"228103012-0-63340";"Tell me about Kilkreath Temple."
"228103012-0-63341";"Tell me about Kilkreath Temple."
"228103012-0-63342";"Tell me about Kilkreath Temple."
"228103012-0-63346";"Do you have any clue why Lady Thorn would want to build an army?"
"228103012-0-63348";"Tell me more about this Lady Thorn."
"228103012-0-63350";"Why are there still so many harrowstorms occurring?"
"228103012-0-63351";"How should I go about dispersing the harrowstorms?"
"228103012-0-63352";"You said the Kjenstag ruins would overwhelm Maxten. What spirits reside there?"
"228103012-0-63355";"What do you know about those mindless creatures?"
"228103012-0-63356";"Rasir hid the cure before testing it, but he told me where to find it."
"228103012-0-63358";"How do you know Aerolf?"
"228103012-0-63361";"How do you feel?"
"228103012-0-63365";"So about this medallion we discussed in the swamp …?"
"228103012-0-63366";"What will you do now that your daughter is home?"
"228103012-0-63367";"I did find that bottle."
"228103012-0-63373";"How do you know Aerolf?"
"228103012-0-63374";"They did. Hafskjar was instrumental in rescuing her."
"228103012-0-63376";"Where do you think you will go?"
"228103012-0-63377";"Is the cure permanent?"
"228103012-0-63386";"How have the people of Morthal accepted her return?"
"228103012-0-63388";"Will you include all the mistakes in your book?"
"228103012-0-63392";"So Talfyg lied the whole time?"
"228103012-0-63393";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-63394";"Why would Lady Thorn reanimate dead vampires?"
"228103012-0-63397";"What was her plan to build the army?"
"228103012-0-63398";"What do you think House Ravenwatch will do with the information?"
"228103012-0-63399";"Why do you think we can learn more at the center of the camp?"
"228103012-0-63400";"What brought you out here? Ravenwatch business?"
"228103012-0-63403";"Svana was impressive. She really stepped up when her kingdom needed her."
"228103012-0-63404";"I'm trying to stop the Gray Host. We need to talk to Arana's sister."
"228103012-0-63405";"Worthy? You sacrificed your own people."
"228103012-0-63407";"Hello, Gwendis. Do you need help with your investigation?"
"228103012-0-63411";"Why is House Ravenwatch investigating the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-63414";"So how do we follow them without a keystone of our own?"
"228103012-0-63415";"It's written by a Gray Host pentarch. Apparently, this is the Library of Arkthzand."
"228103012-0-63416";"The note says the pentarch figured out how to use the void portals. It mentions shards like this."
"228103012-0-63417";"This is related to what we learned in Western Skyrim, isn't it?"
"228103012-0-63418";"Tell me about what you learned."
"228103012-0-63419";"Why are there so many void portals in and around the library?"
"228103012-0-63421";"Are you the only member of the Ravenwatch investigating this?"
"228103012-0-63423";"What's House Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-63425";"The apparatus somehow focuses the void energy. I think he tried to use it to stabilize a breach."
"228103012-0-63426";"What are you hoping to accomplish at the Bangkorai Garrison?"
"228103012-0-63430";"She mentioned Reach witch prophecies. Do you know what she's talking about?"
"228103012-0-63431";"We came a long way to ask you about the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-63438";"Scholar Diel says the missing scholars ran in two different directions."
"228103012-0-63442";"Isn't there anything at all you can tell me about the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-63445";"Scholar Diel sent me to find you. She has a camp outside the garrison's walls."
"228103012-0-63450";"Scholar Diel sent me to find you. She has a camp outside the garrison's walls."
"228103012-0-63455";"Scholar Diel sent me to find you and the scholars. She has a camp outside the garrison's walls."
"228103012-0-63458";"I'm looking for information about the Gray Host of the First Era."
"228103012-0-63459";"I'm looking for information about the Gray Host of the First Era."
"228103012-0-63462";"Can you tell me anything about Viridian Watch?"
"228103012-0-63464";"Shelaria said the historical record is incomplete concerning the details of the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-63468";"Lady Belain convinced Nathari to perform a ritual required by the dark prophecy."
"228103012-0-63469";"Tell me more about Rada al-Saran."
"228103012-0-63471";"Does it have something to do with the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-63475";"Secret passage? But isn't this your castle?"
"228103012-0-63479";"Secret passage? But isn't this your castle?"
"228103012-0-63483";"<Place the Undaunted banner.>"
"228103012-0-63484";"<Place the Undaunted banner.>"
"228103012-0-63485";"What kind of creature was he?"
"228103012-0-63488";"This letter suggests Count Verandis was a member of the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-63494";"What sort of work are you offering?"
"228103012-0-63495";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-63496";"Tell me about the Ard's Stonehands."
"228103012-0-63497";"What sort of things do you need done?"
"228103012-0-63501";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-63507";"Have you figured out the truth behind Rada al-Saran's plots, Verandis?"
"228103012-0-63510";"What do you hope to find at the Arkthzand orrery?"
"228103012-0-63513";"What are you searching for?"
"228103012-0-63514";"How has Markarth fared since the Gray Host's attack?"
"228103012-0-63518";"What do you mean, serve your time?"
"228103012-0-63520";"So what's your job in this crew?"
"228103012-0-63521";"Remind me about this connection to the Dark Heart."
"228103012-0-63525";"Verandis sent me, actually. He didn't mention you'd be here."
"228103012-0-63529";"Could this Darkstorm be related to the harrowstorms of Western Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-63532";"What's so interesting about that trinket?"
"228103012-0-63536";"Seems like you've been busy since I saw you last."
"228103012-0-63537";"You seem anxious to see Verandis."
"228103012-0-63538";"Can you decipher the message?"
"228103012-0-63539";"Arana's sister sacrificed much of her clan to attempt to awaken the Dark Heart."
"228103012-0-63540";"Do you think I can use the void portals to reach the door?"
"228103012-0-63547";"Tell me about the darkness."
"228103012-0-63548";"What does Namira have to do with this?"
"228103012-0-63551";"What do you know about these talismans?"
"228103012-0-63554";"What are we dealing with?"
"228103012-0-63558";"Why do you think this Nighthollow Testament is what we're looking for?"
"228103012-0-63559";"How do you want to do this?"
"228103012-0-63562";"I found some sort of old insignia. Will that work?"
"228103012-0-63567";"Do you think it's some kind of trap?"
"228103012-0-63571";"What should I do next?"
"228103012-0-63573";"What do you make of the memory we saw?"
"228103012-0-63579";"Will any of that help you figure out what the Dark Heart is?"
"228103012-0-63582";"If the path is blocked, how do we get to this chamber?"
"228103012-0-63586";"Any other advice on reaching the chamber?"
"228103012-0-63587";"What should I do next?"
"228103012-0-63589";"I thought Exarch Tzinghalis corrupted Verandis's research, but the memory tells a different tale."
"228103012-0-63593";"What do you mean, unconventional?"
"228103012-0-63598";"Why are you recruiting outsiders to deal with the harrowstorms?"
"228103012-0-63599";"Tell me more about these harrowstorms."
"228103012-0-63600";"I know something about harrowstorms from my time in Western Skyrim."
"228103012-0-63603";"You got into a fight with Ard Caddach?"
"228103012-0-63606";"We knew Verandis was part of the Gray Host, but he cut ties with them centuries ago."
"228103012-0-63607";"What should I do next?"
"228103012-0-63608";"You wanted to speak with me, Ulfra?"
"228103012-0-63615";"The mortal I resurrected went mad, Tzinghalis. The experiment failed."
"228103012-0-63619";"You've built a grand castle, old friend. But I must know, have you considered my request?"
"228103012-0-63623";"I went to Verandis's study in the dream and tried to read his journal."
"228103012-0-63627";"Verandis attempted to resurrect humans and vampires using stone husks."
"228103012-0-63633";"I found another insignia. It appears to be undamaged."
"228103012-0-63635";"What did we just see?"
"228103012-0-63636";"Is that why she is working with Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-63637";"I found this strange stone at the site where the land was sundered from Tamriel."
"228103012-0-63641";"Rada al-Saran has a laboratory? I thought he left that sort of thing to others."
"228103012-0-63643";"You seem conflicted about Rada al-Saran."
"228103012-0-63644";"Any idea what this place might have been?"
"228103012-0-63646";"Why didn't you tell Gwendis about being a member of the Gray Council?"
"228103012-0-63650";"Gwendis and I discovered your connection to the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-63654";"Verandis has promised to help you find out more about the Gray Host and their current plans."
"228103012-0-63657";"Didn't Nathari's sacrifices already awaken the Dark Heart?"
"228103012-0-63665";"Tell me more about Lost Valley."
"228103012-0-63666";"Arana tells me you two know each other from when she was part of the Ghostsong clan."
"228103012-0-63667";"What can you tell me about the ancient Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-63668";"I came here for information about the Gray Host of the First Era. What can you tell me?"
"228103012-0-63670";"Can you make sense of it?"
"228103012-0-63673";"What are we trying to achieve by doing this?"
"228103012-0-63677";"I'll take a look, but what do you think caused all this damage?"
"228103012-0-63683";"Uh, good bunny? You're such a brave bunny?"
"228103012-0-63684";"If <<1>> is so skittish, won't she run when she sees me?"
"228103012-0-63685";"What will the two of you do now?"
"228103012-0-63689";"Tell me more about the storm."
"228103012-0-63690";"Apprentice Fialyn said she needed help restoring the village's wards."
"228103012-0-63691";"What did Rada al-Saran mean, feed on the souls of Markarth?"
"228103012-0-63694";"Remind me, where is Ravenwatch Castle again?"
"228103012-0-63696";"Remind me. Why are we going to this island again?"
"228103012-0-63698";"This is an impressive castle that Rada al-Saran has had constructed."
"228103012-0-63699";"What about your own research, Tzinghalis?"
"228103012-0-63701";"I would like to continue our discussion of an alliance with the mortals later, my friend."
"228103012-0-63702";"I spoke with Ulfra and Tzinghalis."
"228103012-0-63703";"Why did you invite me here if you're unwilling to talk about this?"
"228103012-0-63707";"We know that Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain are seeking something called the Dark Heart."
"228103012-0-63713";"Shouldn't I go with you to confront Boss Trenlor?"
"228103012-0-63714";"Ard Caddach says we can reach the place where the land was sundered by going through Nchuand-Zel."
"228103012-0-63715";"Your plan was to get thrown into this ancient prison?"
"228103012-0-63716";"Bradan, you need to know. Every Reachfolk that dies today feeds the Dark Heart."
"228103012-0-63719";"Lady Belain and the Gray Host want to kill as many of you as they can to feed an arcane relic."
"228103012-0-63721";"Why would Arana go after Lady Belain?"
"228103012-0-63723";"Where is the ritual site?"
"228103012-0-63726";"Tell me more about your sister."
"228103012-0-63727";"I bring information about the witch-rebels from Count Verandis Ravenwatch."
"228103012-0-63731";"Are you ready to face Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-63734";"Any guesses as to what we're charging into?"
"228103012-0-63735";"So Ard Caddach and Arana are working together now?"
"228103012-0-63739";"Why did Arana run off on her own?"
"228103012-0-63742";"Seems that way."
"228103012-0-63745";"Will you and Fennorian be all right here on your own?"
"228103012-0-63746";"Are you tempted by Rada al-Saran's offer?"
"228103012-0-63749";"You're saying it wasn't meant to be a gateway?"
"228103012-0-63750";"That's what Arana claims."
"228103012-0-63752";"Adusa wants to get you out of here. She's not sure why you came back in the first place."
"228103012-0-63756";"Do you really think Verandis could restore Markarth?"
"228103012-0-63758";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-63760";"About Verandis …."
"228103012-0-63762";"Tell me what you have planned."
"228103012-0-63763";"How can that be?"
"228103012-0-63769";"Where are you headed?"
"228103012-0-63770";"About the last time we saw each other …."
"228103012-0-63771";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-63772";"Any sign of Verandis or Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-63773";"What makes you think heading toward the Darkstorm is our best course?"
"228103012-0-63775";"Tell me what happened."
"228103012-0-63776";"What should we do if we don't find Verandis?"
"228103012-0-63778";"When Verandis stops it, he'll be trapped here. He's staying behind."
"228103012-0-63781";"What's a briarheart?"
"228103012-0-63784";"Are you ready to face Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-63788";"Arana couldn't stop Lady Belain, but she led me to another keystone. I have it right here."
"228103012-0-63791";"What will happen to you here?"
"228103012-0-63793";"You aren't coming?"
"228103012-0-63798";"What about your history with Freyleth?"
"228103012-0-63799";"What else can you tell me about the totem?"
"228103012-0-63806";"Yes. Ard Caddach asked me to help you find her."
"228103012-0-63809";"Why do you want me to speak with Shaman Ulvoch?"
"228103012-0-63811";"Yes. We defeated her. But Arana, what happened to you?"
"228103012-0-63814";"Lady Belain took me to the Dark Heart chamber. Arana arrived. She helped me defeat Belain."
"228103012-0-63818";"I thought the darkcap mushroom was only supposed to weaken Boss Trenlor."
"228103012-0-63821";"Arana and I defeated Lady Belain, Rada al-Saran fled, and Verandis stopped the Dwarven machine."
"228103012-0-63823";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-63827";"What message do you think Bradan wants to deliver?"
"228103012-0-63828";"You can thank Verandis. He was able to restore their lives after we defeated Rada al-Saran."
"228103012-0-63829";"I killed Rada al-Saran and Verandis restored the lives lost to the Dark Heart."
"228103012-0-63832";"What can you tell me about these mushrooms?"
"228103012-0-63836";"What are your plans for Markarth now that there's peace?"
"228103012-0-63837";"Tell me your thoughts on the other rulers here."
"228103012-0-63841";"What brings you to the Reach?"
"228103012-0-63845";"What brings you to Skyrim?"
"228103012-0-63848";"What brings you and the Skald-King to Markarth?"
"228103012-0-63849";"You think Rada al-Saran's got more plans for the Reach?"
"228103012-0-63851";"Arana died helping me defeat Lady Belain."
"228103012-0-63855";"You seem to hold Svana in high regard."
"228103012-0-63858";"What more can you tell me about this fungal mold?"
"228103012-0-63860";"I thought you had to stay behind."
"228103012-0-63866";"You seem troubled."
"228103012-0-63869";"All right. What's my assignment?"
"228103012-0-63870";"How do you feel about leading the Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-63875";"I'll remember that."
"228103012-0-63878";"Why is this strange egg so dangerous?"
"228103012-0-63883";"Something went wrong with the restoration ritual."
"228103012-0-63884";"Senan and some of the others fought back. He was mortally wounded by another clan member."
"228103012-0-63885";"The rebel leader might be Arana. They're gathering in the eastern hills."
"228103012-0-63892";"Was the message earlier from him?"
"228103012-0-63894";"Have you met with Svana or Skald-King Jorunn?"
"228103012-0-63896";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-63897";"I'm looking for the witch-rebels. I need to speak to them."
"228103012-0-63900";"The real enemy is Lady Belain. She convinced Nathari to sacrifice your clan."
"228103012-0-63904";"What are you doing out here, anyway?"
"228103012-0-63906";"I just want to know what happened to you. Was it the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-63910";"Why do you care what happens to this Kathad?"
"228103012-0-63911";"I just need to ask you something. Do you happen to know anything about the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"228103012-0-63914";"Here's your package. It has your name on it and everything."
"228103012-0-63916";"Lady Belain and Nathari both believe that sacrificing your clan will awaken the Dark Heart?"
"228103012-0-63917";"I thought Verandis was going to try to locate the rebels and their leader."
"228103012-0-63918";"We gathered the offerings and placed them at the wards."
"228103012-0-63924";"Tell me more about Freyleth."
"228103012-0-63925";"Why should I help you rescue a vampire?"
"228103012-0-63927";"Did we do something wrong?"
"228103012-0-63928";"You're the leader of the witch-rebels?"
"228103012-0-63931";"Yes. I obtained a map that might lead to a place we can find it. Bthar-Zel."
"228103012-0-63932";"Yes. I have the components."
"228103012-0-63937";"Tell me more about Nighthollow Keep."
"228103012-0-63938";"I'm in search of land that was sundered from Tamriel. It happened somewhere in the Reach."
"228103012-0-63943";"Why would you make a deal with someone like Mannimarco?"
"228103012-0-63944";"The currents flowing through the darkness?"
"228103012-0-63951";"Yes, I acquired a darkcap mushroom."
"228103012-0-63953";"What was that you mentioned about auramancy?"
"228103012-0-63954";"Why did a projection of Verandis appear when I examined that trinket?"
"228103012-0-63958";"I have a map that might lead to the keystone."
"228103012-0-63959";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-63960";"Any idea how to open the door?"
"228103012-0-63961";"Do you know what happened to Arana?"
"228103012-0-63962";"Why would Talfyg seek you out? Who are you?"
"228103012-0-63964";"Are you sure you'll be all right?"
"228103012-0-63967";"What's Fenn examining over there?"
"228103012-0-63968";"You saw that projection, right?"
"228103012-0-63969";"We destroyed the corrupted plants. You should be able to complete the ritual now."
"228103012-0-63971";"So what's next for Adusa-daro?"
"228103012-0-63972";"What are you going to do about Freyleth and the Lothid clan?"
"228103012-0-63973";"I'm ready to head to Ravenwatch Castle now. <Fast Travel>"
"228103012-0-63976";"How do you know Adusa-daro?"
"228103012-0-63977";"How did you get involved with the Lothid clan?"
"228103012-0-63979";"Have you decided to join the Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-63980";"Will the Crow-Eye clan recover from the effects of that unnatural storm?"
"228103012-0-63981";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-63986";"Do you think the Lothid clan will accept Freyleth as their leader?"
"228103012-0-63991";"Tell me more about darkcap mushrooms and the Blinds."
"228103012-0-63992";"Why did Boss Trenlor throw you down here?"
"228103012-0-63993";"Why did you kill that vampire?"
"228103012-0-63995";"What will happen to the Lothid clan now?"
"228103012-0-63996";"What do you know about Bthar-Zel?"
"228103012-0-63997";"Why have you brought the Gray Host to the Reach?"
"228103012-0-63998";"Do you really think someone in Understone Keep knows about the land sundered from Tamriel?"
"228103012-0-64002";"What do you know about the Nighthollow Archive?"
"228103012-0-64003";"This could be a trap."
"228103012-0-64008";"What could Arkasis be doing with gray reliquaries?"
"228103012-0-64011";"Yes. I also learned that Lady Belain is a vampire. She's in league with the Gray Host."
"228103012-0-64014";"What makes you say that?"
"228103012-0-64017";"What did you and Caddach argue about?"
"228103012-0-64019";"What's Hroldan Ring?"
"228103012-0-64021";"How have you been since we last saw each other, Shelaria?"
"228103012-0-64022";"Gleaned any insights into Arkasis's research?"
"228103012-0-64025";"How are you dealing with your connection to the Dark Heart?"
"228103012-0-64028";"So what now?"
"228103012-0-64030";"I don't see any sigils."
"228103012-0-64036";"Before I go, remind me what Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain are doing again."
"228103012-0-64040";"Greetings, Longstep. I'm surprised to see you so far from Valenwood."
"228103012-0-64043";"I did not expect to find a member of House Indoril here. Why did you join the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-64046";"I'd hardly call forging a permanent peace between vampires and humans a hobby, Sanctus."
"228103012-0-64049";"Another riddle, Gazes?"
"228103012-0-64052";"It's good to see you, Vem. How are things in the Empire?"
"228103012-0-64055";"Mortal blood is not as plentiful as mead, Uls. It's not wise to gorge yourself like this."
"228103012-0-64059";"Tell me more about what I need to do."
"228103012-0-64061";"For what purpose?"
"228103012-0-64064";"Your wife sent me to find you. She was worried that you might have gotten lost."
"228103012-0-64071";"Gwendis told me you broke free from this castle."
"228103012-0-64074";"Why do you need to take Gwendis into a side door?"
"228103012-0-64077";"Your wife sent me to find you. She was worried that you might have gotten lost."
"228103012-0-64088";"Vampires, Dwarves, Reach witches … who does the Dark Heart really belong to?"
"228103012-0-64089";"Is that why she is working with Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-64090";"Did the Ravenwatch send you here?"
"228103012-0-64093";"Do you know anything about the co-conspirators Arkasis is working with?"
"228103012-0-64094";"Did you find what Talfyg wanted to show you?"
"228103012-0-64101";"How deep a connection are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-64104";"What do you need from me?"
"228103012-0-64109";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"228103012-0-64116";"I'm no exarch, dear Faustine. I want nothing to do with grandiose titles or Styriche's army."
"228103012-0-64121";"Why do you care about this Gray Host and the Reach?"
"228103012-0-64131";"Tell me more about the Despot of Markarth."
"228103012-0-64132";"We'll stop Rada al-Saran, Gwendis."
"228103012-0-64133";"How do we get to the sanctuary realm?"
"228103012-0-64136";"Is it really as bad as all that? The Reach, I mean?"
"228103012-0-64143";"What does this Prophecy of the Dark Heart actually say?"
"228103012-0-64150";"The Gray Host has come to the Reach. Count Verandis wants to help stop them."
"228103012-0-64152";"How will personal items help you learn anything about Nighthollow Keep?"
"228103012-0-64155";"Except for Lady Belain."
"228103012-0-64160";"How is Arkasis connected to Lady Thorn?"
"228103012-0-64161";"You recognized some of these things. What can you tell me?"
"228103012-0-64164";"What do you need from me?"
"228103012-0-64167";"You believe?"
"228103012-0-64175";"I found these unusual plants around the ritual pyre."
"228103012-0-64182";"I came on my own. Why is this place so important?"
"228103012-0-64183";"Give me a foe worth bragging about!"
"228103012-0-64184";"I drove the True-Sworn pillagers from Black Drake Villa and extinguished their plans."
"228103012-0-64186";"What deal do you mean?"
"228103012-0-64188";"Yes. I completed the dungeon."
"228103012-0-64215";"I came here for information about the Gray Host's defeat in the First Era. What can you tell me?"
"228103012-0-64216";"How will information help get us an audience with Ard Caddach?"
"228103012-0-64226";"You look as out of place in this court as I do."
"228103012-0-64230";"Tell me more about Ard Caddach."
"228103012-0-64233";"People keep referring to Caddach as ""Ardhun."" What does that mean?"
"228103012-0-64235";"What do you need help with?"
"228103012-0-64238";"What's the rebellion all about?"
"228103012-0-64242";"Have you given any thought to what you'll do now that the threat has passed?"
"228103012-0-64243";"Tell me more about the wards that protect your village."
"228103012-0-64259";"Did Verandis mention what he wants to discuss with me?"
"228103012-0-64261";"Your rebellion. Do you plan to overthrow Markarth?"
"228103012-0-64266";"Is this about the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-64267";"Maybe we can still catch up to her."
"228103012-0-64270";"Tell me more about you and your rebels."
"228103012-0-64280";"Are you really a witch?"
"228103012-0-64289";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-64294";"Will I see you again?"
"228103012-0-64300";"Do you still think the spirits sent me to help you?"
"228103012-0-64308";"What's next for the Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-64310";"What comes next now that you've declared peace?"
"228103012-0-64311";"Do you believe this peace will last?"
"228103012-0-64313";"What will you and the rebels do now?"
"228103012-0-64314";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-64315";"What should I write in this message?"
"228103012-0-64317";"Will your people be safe now?"
"228103012-0-64320";"You seem anxious to see Verandis."
"228103012-0-64321";"Blond giant? Do you mean Lyris Titanborn?"
"228103012-0-64326";"Blond giant? So you saw Lyris Titanborn?"
"228103012-0-64330";"Scout Fulgof sent me to help. He said you were looking into a problem."
"228103012-0-64334";"Lyris said to look for a letter dealing with Rada al-Saran and a Reach hero. I think this is it."
"228103012-0-64336";"All right, I'll play your game."
"228103012-0-64338";"Ard Caddach sent me to his advisor, Lady Belain. They asked me to find the rebel leader, Arana."
"228103012-0-64339";"I don't understand how a Reach hero could teach a Redguard swordmaster anything."
"228103012-0-64348";"So, what does a shaman's apprentice do exactly?"
"228103012-0-64350";"Where did you come from?"
"228103012-0-64374";"Do you know anything about the ancient defeat of the Gray Host?"
"228103012-0-64375";"Tell me more about the spirits your clan reveres."
"228103012-0-64376";"What's the purpose of the wards?"
"228103012-0-64377";"Scholar Diel sent me to find you and the scholars. She has a camp outside the garrison's walls."
"228103012-0-64388";"Who was that you were arguing with?"
"228103012-0-64391";"I see you finally got the army you so desperately sought, Styriche."
"228103012-0-64394";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-64396";"I see you finally got the army you so desperately sought, Styriche."
"228103012-0-64402";"What dark things do you speak of?"
"228103012-0-64404";"How many of your clan were in Markarth?"
"228103012-0-64405";"It's true, the dead have returned to life."
"228103012-0-64406";"Who's traveling with you?"
"228103012-0-64407";"The road must be hard on you."
"228103012-0-64408";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-64409";"It's true. The dead have returned to life."
"228103012-0-64411";"What kind of performance?"
"228103012-0-64418";"Is there really silver in Bthar-Zel?"
"228103012-0-64420";"Why do you think I'll find the keystone in Bthar-Zel?"
"228103012-0-64423";"It didn't take long for Verandis to make contact with the rebels."
"228103012-0-64426";"Tell me more about this ritual."
"228103012-0-64432";"Tell me more about the Snake in the Stars."
"228103012-0-64435";"How could Lady Belain get into the ruins ahead of us?"
"228103012-0-64438";"Tell me more about the darkness you're sensing."
"228103012-0-64441";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-64445";"Do you worry about encountering the Gray Host out here?"
"228103012-0-64446";"What's your mission this time?"
"228103012-0-64447";"When will you see them next?"
"228103012-0-64448";"Do you know what your next mission will be?"
"228103012-0-64449";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-64450";"Why are you sorry?"
"228103012-0-64451";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-64452";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-64453";"What is it?"
"228103012-0-64473";"Tell me more about the Vateshran's Rites."
"228103012-0-64475";"Why do you refer to yourself as ""we?"""
"228103012-0-64476";"What do you mean that Vateshran Hollows behaves strangely?"
"228103012-0-64477";"Can you tell me more about Old Life?"
"228103012-0-64478";"You read fortunes? Very well, tell me mine."
"228103012-0-64479";"I noticed colorless splotches dotting the landscape."
"228103012-0-64480";"What do you think has happened to it?"
"228103012-0-64481";"What will happen to the Rites?"
"228103012-0-64482";"Is Aydolan lost forever?"
"228103012-0-64488";"What do you do here?"
"228103012-0-64489";"What do you do in Vateshran Hollows?"
"228103012-0-64490";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-64491";"Can you help me understand the Choosing?"
"228103012-0-64496";"You use animal entrails to tell the future?"
"228103012-0-64497";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-64498";"How long do you plan on staying out here?"
"228103012-0-64501";"Has your opinion of outsiders changed?"

"228103012-0-64510";"Tell me more about Reachmen veneration of Mehrunes Dagon."
"228103012-0-64511";"Why didn't you warn me before?"
"228103012-0-64515";"What is a handfasting, exactly?"
"228103012-0-64516";"Chief-of-chiefs? Does that mean you're in charge of all the clans?"
"228103012-0-64517";"What's the favor?"
"228103012-0-64523";"I get the sense that these clans don't really like each other."
"228103012-0-64524";"Why are you and Arana at odds?"
"228103012-0-64527";"Why don't you think the Gray Host will attack Markarth?"
"228103012-0-64528";"You don't seem happy about this impending marriage."
"228103012-0-64530";"Why don't you and Chief Six-Ford get along?"
"228103012-0-64534";"How did you become the Despot of Markarth?"
"228103012-0-64535";"You seem relatively indifferent to these proceedings."
"228103012-0-64537";"Why are you so hostile toward the Six-Ford clan?"
"228103012-0-64538";"You don't seem happy about this impending marriage."
"228103012-0-64543";"Why don't you and Chief Eagleseer get along?"
"228103012-0-64544";"Is there something you want me to tell Madearn for you?"
"228103012-0-64550";"I burned the paper and then …."
"228103012-0-64552";"Eslyn and Madearn weren't inside the cave. I found this note."
"228103012-0-64556";"What if I can't convince them to come back to Hroldan Ring?"
"228103012-0-64562";"Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear wants you to return and complete the handfasting."
"228103012-0-64563";"Did you get to know Eslyn in the handfasting cave?"
"228103012-0-64568";"Tell me more about this vateshran we're going to see."
"228103012-0-64569";"Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear wants you to come back to Hroldan Ring."
"228103012-0-64574";"Why were you selected to marry Madearn?"
"228103012-0-64575";"What else can you tell me about this vateshran we're looking for?"
"228103012-0-64578";"Master Pythis betrayed you."
"228103012-0-64583";"Why do you want the Dwarven construct destroyed?"
"228103012-0-64586";"You never noticed the Gray Host working around here?"
"228103012-0-64590";"I found Arana. We destroyed Lady Belain before she could restore the Nighthollows."
"228103012-0-64591";"I found Arana. We destroyed Lady Belain before she could restore the Nighthollows."
"228103012-0-64592";"What do you know of the Black Drake Villa?"
"228103012-0-64593";"You mentioned someone hired you to find the book?"
"228103012-0-64601";"Do you know the story of Faolan Red Eagle and Rada al-Saran?"
"228103012-0-64605";"Who would want to destroy this villa?"
"228103012-0-64607";"I have questions about our search."
"228103012-0-64611";"Plunder?"
"228103012-0-64615";"Yeah, it's me. I'm back for more."
"228103012-0-64625";"The vateshran knows you helped the clans. She said we need to go to the cave beneath the redoubt."
"228103012-0-64631";"What do you think the words of the song mean, Lyris?"
"228103012-0-64645";"What can you tell me about the Lothid clan?"
"228103012-0-64647";"Are all Old Life shrines the same?"
"228103012-0-64649";"What do you plan to do while we're gone?"
"228103012-0-64653";"Medone sent me to rescue your people and stop the briarheart rituals."
"228103012-0-64654";"Take me to Mournhold."
"228103012-0-64655";"Take me to Wayrest."
"228103012-0-64656";"Take me to Elden Root."
"228103012-0-64657";"Tell me about Adusa-daro."
"228103012-0-64665";"Can you tell me how the feud between the Eagleseer and Six-Ford clans began?"

"228103012-0-64680";"You don't think we should end the feud?"
"228103012-0-64682";"You're worried about Eslyn, aren't you?"
"228103012-0-64685";"You meant to go to Faolan's Ire?"
"228103012-0-64689";"Are you fond of Eslyn now?"
"228103012-0-64691";"Where's Madearn?"
"228103012-0-64694";"Are you sure the fragment is at the Giant's camp?"
"228103012-0-64695";"You seem conflicted."
"228103012-0-64696";"You seem happy that Madearn's here."
"228103012-0-64698";"Why deal with someone like Mannimarco?"
"228103012-0-64699";"What happens after I bring Eslyn and Madearn here?"
"228103012-0-64700";"Are you coming with me to find the keystone?"
"228103012-0-64706";"Eslyn and Madearn found a way to end the feud without the handfasting."
"228103012-0-64715";"What happens now?"
"228103012-0-64716";"So you have a history with Adusa-daro?"
"228103012-0-64717";"Why do I need a disguise?"
"228103012-0-64718";"I told Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear I wouldn't force Eslyn and Madearn go through with the handfasting."
"228103012-0-64719";"The chief-of-chiefs insisted on going through with the handfasting. I agree with her."
"228103012-0-64722";"She told me to convince you to do the handfasting. I refused."
"228103012-0-64725";"What happens now?"
"228103012-0-64726";"She told me to force you to perform the handfasting. I refused."
"228103012-0-64729";"Do you think this will work?"
"228103012-0-64731";"She says the handfasting is the only way to end the feud. I agree."
"228103012-0-64734";"Are you ready for what comes next?"
"228103012-0-64735";"You need to decide soon."
"228103012-0-64736";"Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear says the handfasting is the only way to end the feud. I think she's right."
"228103012-0-64741";"Are you ready for what comes next?"
"228103012-0-64743";"Who do you think these people are?"
"228103012-0-64744";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-64745";"Do you have any regrets?"
"228103012-0-64746";"Do you regret your decision?"
"228103012-0-64748";"What do you think will happen now?"
"228103012-0-64752";"How do you feel about what just happened?"
"228103012-0-64753";"You seem unhappy about facing your sister."
"228103012-0-64754";"You seem unhappy about facing your sister."

"228103012-0-64763";"How's Karthwasten?"
"228103012-0-64764";"You're welcome."
"228103012-0-64765";"How do the Crow-Eye fare?"
"228103012-0-64766";"You don't like being thanked for your work?"
"228103012-0-64767";"Is life in the Ravenwatch everything you expected?"
"228103012-0-64768";"What have you been up to since we last spoke?"
"228103012-0-64769";"How are you doing?"
"228103012-0-64770";"How did you know to come help?"
"228103012-0-64773";"Anything you want to say before we go?"
"228103012-0-64775";"How does the orrery work, exactly?"
"228103012-0-64776";"Ard Caddach wants to know if you're willing to become his new counselor."
"228103012-0-64779";"Can you tell me more about this friend you want me to meet?"
"228103012-0-64782";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-64786";"Are you ready to lead the Ravenwatch?"
"228103012-0-64787";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-64788";"I understand."
"228103012-0-64789";"What will you and the other leaders do now?"
"228103012-0-64790";"Back to your books now that this is over?"
"228103012-0-64797";"You mentioned refugees?"
"228103012-0-64800";"Tell me about your clan."
"228103012-0-64806";"What is this place?"

"228103012-0-65321";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-65323";"I was too late. He was already dead when I found him."
"228103012-0-65326";"What leads are you looking into?"
"228103012-0-65329";"It's an order from Emperor Leovic. He told Jirich to move the Ambitions but the last line's in code."
"228103012-0-65330";"Your records include information on the Ambitions?"
"228103012-0-65336";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-65338";"Councilor Sophus has been murdered too, but Faleria is safe. These notes were by each of the bodies."

"228103012-0-65355";"You sacrificed yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings. You should be dead!"
"228103012-0-65356";"How did you meet Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-65358";"Rada al-Saran has a laboratory? I thought he left that sort of thing to others?"
"228103012-0-65359";"Vandacia lured out Destron by threatening Calia. We couldn't hold him back."
"228103012-0-65361";"You said you knew Eveli had that book when we first found you. How?"
"228103012-0-65365";"If you die, your energy just returns to Mehrunes Dagon. That's not really an option."
"228103012-0-65370";"How are you dealing with your connection to the Dark Heart?"
"228103012-0-65372";"Do you know where your family might be?"

"228103012-0-65388";"Erithel? You're one of the infiltrators Commander Axius mentioned? Where's your partner?"
"228103012-0-65392";"Commander Axius sent me. Are you one of the infiltrators he sent to rescue the hostages?"
"228103012-0-65396";"How did you and Seeks-the-Dark get involved with this?"
"228103012-0-65397";"I'm not sure we could have beaten Vandacia without Sombren and Calia's help."
"228103012-0-65402";"Mehrunes Dagon won't stop trying to capture the Ambitions. Will you continue to help us?"
"228103012-0-65405";"You and Tenarei Vels are after the same quarry."
"228103012-0-65406";"Tell me more about this Golden Anvil we are searching for."
"228103012-0-65407";"Learn to control your power. And carry on."
"228103012-0-65410";"I'm sorry about Destron, but we stopped Vandacia and saved Tamriel."
"228103012-0-65413";"Speaking of losses, how did the Black Fin Legion and the Ivory Brigade fare in the battle?"
"228103012-0-65415";"So, the Ambitions were an elaborate scheme to merge Dagon's power with Nirn so he could conquer it."
"228103012-0-65418";"What else do you know about this place?"
"228103012-0-65426";"I'd like to know more about your faith."
"228103012-0-65429";"That's right."
"228103012-0-65430";"Who were the trade-ministers?"
"228103012-0-65434";"Why were you locked up?"
"228103012-0-65435";"What did you learn?"
"228103012-0-65439";"The Painted Eye have me and an associate to keep them occupied."
"228103012-0-65440";"Commander Axius sent me to free everyone."
"228103012-0-65444";"Will you be fine on your own?"
"228103012-0-65445";"Keep your voice down. The Painted Eye still controls Borderwatch."
"228103012-0-65449";"Is the Painted Eye keeping any other hostages in the fortress?"
"228103012-0-65450";"We're missing a hostage—an Ayleid scholar. The Painted Eye dragged him off to the keep."
"228103012-0-65454";"Who hired you to steal the relic from the Ayleid ruin?"
"228103012-0-65456";"Where should I look for the scholar that the Painted Eye is interrogating?"
"228103012-0-65457";"Do you think that's where he kept the anvil?"
"228103012-0-65459";"We'll get you free. But we need information on the Ayleid ruin that the Painted Eye is looking for."
"228103012-0-65463";"Commander Axius really closed the chapel so you could study it?"
"228103012-0-65466";"Why do you think this is where Phalevon is buried?"
"228103012-0-65470";"What about the relic?"
"228103012-0-65474";"What will you tell the Thieves Guild about what happened here?"
"228103012-0-65476";"And how you dropped out of the rafters?"
"228103012-0-65480";"You're already thinking about your next job?"
"228103012-0-65483";"What did you find out?"
"228103012-0-65484";"You did well in that fight."
"228103012-0-65485";"We're looking for a Breton named Quistley Silvelle. Have you seen him?"
"228103012-0-65487";"Do you know anything about Sithis cults?"
"228103012-0-65489";"Why are you the one responsible for Quistley?"
"228103012-0-65494";"That letter to Amnis suggests that Vandacia went to the Salvitto Estate."
"228103012-0-65496";"Councilor Vandacia. Where is he?"
"228103012-0-65499";"Salvitto gave us his invitation and this strange coin."
"228103012-0-65501";"Should we head directly for the docks?"
"228103012-0-65503";"We need to purchase some attire for a formal event."
"228103012-0-65504";"I represent Eveli Sharp-Arrow. She wants to turn over the item you sent her to recover."
"228103012-0-65505";"Remind me, what's Vandacia want with the Ambitions again?"
"228103012-0-65507";"Why are you suddenly worried about Vandacia's forces?"
"228103012-0-65511";"We need information. We're looking for Quistley Silvelle."
"228103012-0-65516";"It looks great on you, Eveli."
"228103012-0-65519";"It's supposed to be a long voyage. What should we do now?"
"228103012-0-65521";"Do you think we should wait and see what Vandacia has to say?"
"228103012-0-65522";"Where are we, Eveli?"
"228103012-0-65524";"Why did Calia lose control like that?"
"228103012-0-65527";"What were you trying to do?"
"228103012-0-65530";"What do you mean when you say Calia's power will consume her?"
"228103012-0-65533";"Governor Keshu suggested we might want to leave Gideon for a while."
"228103012-0-65535";"Tell me more about your mentor."
"228103012-0-65539";"Is Quistley the type to join a cult?"
"228103012-0-65542";"We're not nobles. We're here to stop whatever Vandacia has planned."
"228103012-0-65545";"But I found the key."
"228103012-0-65548";"Can you tell me where you came from? How Vandacia captured you?"
"228103012-0-65550";"Sombren says you mentored him. Helped him control his power."
"228103012-0-65553";"You should have told us your mentor was a Dremora."
"228103012-0-65556";"Have you ever heard of this attunement process before?"
"228103012-0-65557";"Do you think we should trust Xynaa?"
"228103012-0-65558";"Tell me about these trials. What's the Path of the Obelisks?"
"228103012-0-65559";"What should I be doing while you attune the twins?"
"228103012-0-65562";"What's the experiment?"
"228103012-0-65565";"Can you tell me more about this Phantasmal Censer?"
"228103012-0-65566";"Tell me about your pupil, Tiras."
"228103012-0-65567";"Why are you conducting this experiment in Veyond?"
"228103012-0-65568";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-65572";"So, what are these runes for, again?"
"228103012-0-65573";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-65574";"You don't think what Revus is doing will work?"
"228103012-0-65579";"Yes, I painted all the runes. What's next?"
"228103012-0-65583";"Of course. Can you remind me of what to do again?"
"228103012-0-65584";"Tell me more about the person who sent me this message."
"228103012-0-65585";"How did you survive being imprisoned in here?"
"228103012-0-65586";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-65587";"Yes. Here are all the apples I was able to collect."
"228103012-0-65592";"What was happening to the Golden Anvil?"
"228103012-0-65594";"Any idea who sent the courier?"
"228103012-0-65595";"Did we do something wrong?"
"228103012-0-65601";"Yes, Tiras thinks it's a waste of time. But what do you think?"
"228103012-0-65602";"I'm helping Bastian Hallix find his foster brother."
"228103012-0-65603";"Can you tell me more about the Sul-Xan?"
"228103012-0-65607";"What do you know about this place?"
"228103012-0-65610";"Do you know what we should be looking for?"
"228103012-0-65611";"How is it you make your special cider?"
"228103012-0-65612";"What is a clouded Varla Stone?"
"228103012-0-65618";"What do you think the vampire knows?"
"228103012-0-65622";"Slow down. What just happened?"
"228103012-0-65626";"I was helping Bastian Hallix find his foster brother."
"228103012-0-65628";"First tell me how you wound up in that cell."
"228103012-0-65630";"How does that help us save Tiras?"
"228103012-0-65638";"Yes. What do I need to do?"
"228103012-0-65645";"What can you tell me about Keshu?"
"228103012-0-65646";"What do you know about Gideon?"
"228103012-0-65647";"Were you surprised by Vandacia's treachery?"
"228103012-0-65651";"Farrul Lupus was murdered. Does this have something to do with Emperor Leovic's secret?"
"228103012-0-65654";"What happens if you return empty-handed?"
"228103012-0-65658";"You said Leovic told Farrul things but you don't know specifics. Anything you can remember may help."
"228103012-0-65661";"Have you learned anything more about this cult?"
"228103012-0-65663";"If we find Quistley alive, don't do anything rash."
"228103012-0-65665";"What's your plan?"
"228103012-0-65666";"We saved your life. The cultists planned to sacrifice you."
"228103012-0-65667";"You don't want to deliver Quistley to Larz-Tul?"
"228103012-0-65669";"What do you want to do about Quistley and Tenarei?"
"228103012-0-65678";"I'd like to board, please."
"228103012-0-65679";"We're here to travel to the event."
"228103012-0-65681";"We have a strange book, a secret that may concern the fate of the world, and a murdered steward."
"228103012-0-65687";"The coded message led us to Leovic's steward, but he was murdered by the Dark Brotherhood."
"228103012-0-65693";"How did the murderer get in and out of the watchtower without the brigadines noticing?"
"228103012-0-65699";"How long have you been the governor of Gideon?"
"228103012-0-65700";"You had no idea Vandacia was the leader of a Daedric cult?"
"228103012-0-65701";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-65703";"The other visions showed the twins' past. Why is this one different?"
"228103012-0-65711";"That was only a vision, Calia. We haven't been defeated yet."
"228103012-0-65712";"A deciphered document claims the vault is in the ojel-bak. Do you know where that is?"
"228103012-0-65713";"Commotion?"
"228103012-0-65719";"Despite appearances, this isn't over yet, Destron."
"228103012-0-65724";"So Vandacia is going to win? Mehrunes Dagon is going to claim our world?"
"228103012-0-65726";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-65727";"The Ambitions are people. They should get to decide their own fate."
"228103012-0-65732";"The Waking Flame cultists were in the annex when we arrived."
"228103012-0-65733";"What's the Spidernest?"
"228103012-0-65734";"Commander Ortin asked us to find Talaise. Any idea where we should look?"
"228103012-0-65741";"Any thoughts on how we should approach this?"
"228103012-0-65746";"Are you all right? You seem nervous."
"228103012-0-65747";"Will you be all right hanging on to that strange book?"
"228103012-0-65748";"What do you know about Leyawiin?"
"228103012-0-65750";"You really think the Waking Flame cultists are out here?"
"228103012-0-65751";"What happens if we can't avoid the Sul-Xan?"
"228103012-0-65760";"Commander Ortin asked us to locate Talaise. Any idea where she might be?"
"228103012-0-65765";"I'm trying to find Talaise. Any idea where we should look?"
"228103012-0-65778";"Do you think we should take a look in the pantry?"
"228103012-0-65779";"Where'd you learn that?"
"228103012-0-65782";"Do you think it's true? That you were created to transform the power Dagon placed inside you?"
"228103012-0-65787";"Can you keep Calia and Destron from destroying themselves?"
"228103012-0-65791";"Who are you? What brought this curse on the castle?"
"228103012-0-65793";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-65795";"How so?"
"228103012-0-65799";"The duchess says her son Mathen was cursed."
"228103012-0-65802";"Why burn the remains?"
"228103012-0-65804";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-65805";"Ajum-Shei?"
"228103012-0-65806";"I found an old ring and a journal belonging to Alizinda."
"228103012-0-65809";"Your mother, Duchess Astella, asked us to speak to you. She said you're both victims of a curse."
"228103012-0-65812";"No. Some strange lines written out. Have a look."
"228103012-0-65815";"We found Mathen, but Alizinda didn't place the curse on Giovesse. Someone else did."
"228103012-0-65818";"What can you tell me about Borderwatch?"
"228103012-0-65819";"How did they manage to take over Borderwatch?"
"228103012-0-65822";"What can you tell me about the Painted Eye?"
"228103012-0-65831";"Your mother is responsible for the curse. She told us to find your armor so we can break the spell."
"228103012-0-65834";"Does this sound like the usual way the Dark Brotherhood operates?"
"228103012-0-65836";"Eveli, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-65839";"Why me?"
"228103012-0-65840";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-65841";"How have you been since I visited the House of Reveries?"
"228103012-0-65842";"I'm looking into the disappearances and the strange way people are acting when they return."
"228103012-0-65847";"I'm helping Alchemy with your problem. She suggested I hear your story for myself."
"228103012-0-65852";"I'm looking into the disappearances and the strange way people are acting when they return."
"228103012-0-65853";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-65861";"Tell me about yourself."
"228103012-0-65863";"All the victims wanted to reminisce about the past and disappeared again after sudden accidents."
"228103012-0-65873";"Councilors Sophus and Abor were murdered, just like Jirich. You need to go to Leyawiin Castle."
"228103012-0-65881";"Mathen abducted her. What did you mean, ""spare him the pain?"""
"228103012-0-65884";"How does Ajum-Shei's gem help the ritual?"
"228103012-0-65885";"How are your wounds?"
"228103012-0-65887";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-65888";"You mean you're still trapped here despite breaking the curse?"
"228103012-0-65891";"He said the choice is yours."
"228103012-0-65895";"Why did Deet-Loh go into the ruins?"
"228103012-0-65897";"I'm no assassin. Councilor Lovidicus sent me to warn you. He wants you to go to Leyawiin."
"228103012-0-65898";"You really don't have any idea what the secret of the Longhouse Emperors pertains to?"
"228103012-0-65902";"Aid one another? What are you proposing, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-65904";"Councilor Lovidicus and Captain Rian sent me to warn Vandacia and get him to go to Leyawiin Castle."
"228103012-0-65910";"What makes you say that?"
"228103012-0-65914";"What if the one who led Annyce out here returns?"
"228103012-0-65919";"You're not the first person to disappear recently."
"228103012-0-65925";"Aid one another? What are you proposing?"
"228103012-0-65928";"This is all for show, right?"
"228103012-0-65929";"I don't have anything to compare her to, but she might know more than she's letting on."
"228103012-0-65933";"Are you that worried about Annyce?"
"228103012-0-65934";"How do you know the vault is Daedric?"
"228103012-0-65935";"Tell me more about the Mysterium Xarxes."
"228103012-0-65936";"What's my motivation again?"
"228103012-0-65943";"Do you think you father is up ahead?"
"228103012-0-65944";"Did Baron Zaudrus say anything to you?"
"228103012-0-65945";"What about forcing my way through?"
"228103012-0-65948";"For treasure."
"228103012-0-65949";"To find glory in battle."
"228103012-0-65951";"To serve our captain."
"228103012-0-65956";"To see new lands."
"228103012-0-65957";"To find rare artifacts."
"228103012-0-65958";"To meet Sithis."
"228103012-0-65960";"Because your crew is your family."
"228103012-0-65961";"Because there's strength in numbers."
"228103012-0-65962";"Because you'd have no one to talk to."
"228103012-0-65967";"Unless what?"
"228103012-0-65968";"The letter talks about opening a Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in Bloodrun Cave."
"228103012-0-65969";"The letter talks about opening a Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in Bloodrun Cave."
"228103012-0-65977";"This must be the place."
"228103012-0-65978";"I wasn't able to apprehend the Dark Brotherhood agent, but I recovered this letter."
"228103012-0-65984";"I found a letter. It talked about reestablishing a Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in Bloodrun Cave."
"228103012-0-65986";"Tell me more about the Longhouse Emperors."
"228103012-0-65991";"So they're not in any danger?"
"228103012-0-65993";"Why didn't you follow them?"
"228103012-0-65995";"I need to know about Cres."
"228103012-0-66003";"Annyce was dreaming of being part of Captain Wereshark's crew. Is that why we saw pirates outside?"
"228103012-0-66008";"Explain what happened."
"228103012-0-66012";"I know you're not really Annyce, Cres."
"228103012-0-66017";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-66018";"Do you know anything about this place?"
"228103012-0-66019";"I have the silk you requested."
"228103012-0-66023";"Making a deal with Daedra rarely leads to anything good. We need to send Cres back to Oblivion."
"228103012-0-66025";"That sounds like a perfect fit for them. They should join your troupe."
"228103012-0-66027";"These people seem devastated by being woken from their dreams."
"228103012-0-66029";"Of all the places you could have chosen, why Farmer's Nook?"
"228103012-0-66031";"What will you do if you stay?"
"228103012-0-66032";"If you don't return, won't someone come looking for you?"
"228103012-0-66034";"Remind me about the Daedric weapons."
"228103012-0-66035";"Tell me more about that book you're carrying."
"228103012-0-66037";"Are you ready to face Baron Zaudrus?"
"228103012-0-66040";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-66043";"What do you think will happen to the Sul-Xan?"
"228103012-0-66044";"Um, do you know where the ship is headed?"
"228103012-0-66045";"Uh, no. We only met recently."
"228103012-0-66047";"Waking vision?"
"228103012-0-66052";"What's the Idol of Xet?"
"228103012-0-66053";"You should know that the Painted Eye's demands were a ruse."
"228103012-0-66054";"What will you and your forces do now?"
"228103012-0-66056";"There are still more than a few."
"228103012-0-66057";"Why are you in a rush to get back into Borderwatch?"
"228103012-0-66058";"Why's that?"
"228103012-0-66059";"She's gone. Why?"
"228103012-0-66060";"I didn't really have time to study it."
"228103012-0-66061";"Here you go."
"228103012-0-66065";"I'm looking for Imperial caches in a hidden annex chamber."
"228103012-0-66069";"What were the cultists up to?"
"228103012-0-66070";"What will you do next?"
"228103012-0-66071";"Why are you after the Imperial cache?"
"228103012-0-66072";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-66073";"What will you do next?"
"228103012-0-66074";"How is your father?"
"228103012-0-66075";"What can you tell me about Doombringer Eshil?"
"228103012-0-66077";"Do you think it works like the one outside?"
"228103012-0-66080";"What was happening in that weird open space we came through to get here?"
"228103012-0-66086";"There's another warded door ahead?"
"228103012-0-66093";"Are you sure you're completely over that curse? You don't sound so good."
"228103012-0-66094";"So, what's next for you two?"
"228103012-0-66095";"No secrets. At least none that I could tell. Just a signet ring and a scroll written in code."
"228103012-0-66097";"Tell me more about this contact of yours that can break Imperial codes."
"228103012-0-66099";"I found Emperor Leovic's signet ring and a scroll written in an Imperial code."
"228103012-0-66102";"Yes, but it's written in code. Can you decipher it?"
"228103012-0-66105";"You can talk to me now. What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-66108";"We're here on behalf of Leyawiin and Gideon. We're looking for the Four Ambitions."
"228103012-0-66109";"So tell me, who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-66110";"What can you tell me about this vault?"
"228103012-0-66119";"We're here on behalf of Leyawiin and Gideon. We're looking for the Four Ambitions."
"228103012-0-66120";"So tell me, who are you exactly?"
"228103012-0-66121";"What else can you tell me about this vault?"
"228103012-0-66128";"How were they able to portal so deep into the vault?"
"228103012-0-66131";"That was an impressive display of power."
"228103012-0-66132";"Did you know your brother could do that?"
"228103012-0-66137";"So what do you suggest?"
"228103012-0-66138";"You learned enough? You're leaving?"
"228103012-0-66139";"Who are these so-called professionals you mentioned?"
"228103012-0-66140";"What happened at the fort?"
"228103012-0-66145";"We believe so. The cultists certainly seemed to think so. And Destron demonstrated great power."
"228103012-0-66149";"What do the runes do?"
"228103012-0-66152";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-66153";"You didn't say anything about a horn before."
"228103012-0-66157";"Why have you summoned me, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-66161";"Did the spirits tell you how to fix the volcanic vents?"
"228103012-0-66163";"Why would cultists attack the sanctuary?"
"228103012-0-66166";"You don't sound excited."
"228103012-0-66167";"I'm looking for Imperial caches in a hidden annex chamber."
"228103012-0-66174";"What are you doing here, Eveli?"
"228103012-0-66177";"So, what's the prank?"
"228103012-0-66181";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-66183";"Actually, one of your people is responsible for the missing people, both Argonian and Imperial."
"228103012-0-66187";"Do you think your people would be willing to help the Argonians enter the xanmeer?"
"228103012-0-66189";"What's the Clutch of Nisswo?"
"228103012-0-66190";"Why have you summoned me, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-66194";"Why did you do it?"
"228103012-0-66200";"What do you hope to find in the concealed annex?"
"228103012-0-66202";"We think the murders have something to do with a secret of the Longhouse Emperors."
"228103012-0-66203";"Why are you so interested in figuring out who their high priest is?"
"228103012-0-66207";"What's it like to have Eveli as a sister?"
"228103012-0-66209";"What else do you know about Farrul Lupus?"
"228103012-0-66210";"Tell me more about the book you were sent to retrieve from Black Drake Villa."
"228103012-0-66211";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-66213";"I'm ready. What would you suggest?"
"228103012-0-66215";"Let's just say … <<1>> has a new shine about him."
"228103012-0-66219";"What are you going to do with the relics we recovered?"
"228103012-0-66222";"Find a new mystery to unravel. And make sure to destroy that horn."
"228103012-0-66223";"Find a new mystery to unravel. And, just in case, don't let anyone blow the horn."
"228103012-0-66224";"That's right. Do you know something?"
"228103012-0-66228";"What can you tell me about Annyce?"
"228103012-0-66231";"I heard Igmund went missing for a little while."
"228103012-0-66232";"Who were those Goblins I just fought?"
"228103012-0-66234";"That was the last time you saw her?"
"228103012-0-66235";"Who was Bugtail to you?"
"228103012-0-66240";"What makes you say that?"
"228103012-0-66242";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-66247";"They sent whatever they found to Vandacia and apparently ordered the cultists to attack Leyawiin."
"228103012-0-66248";"You won't come with me to defend the councilors?"
"228103012-0-66252";"Councilor Vandacia is behind everything. He's the high priest of the Order of the Waking Flame."
"228103012-0-66255";"Vandacia tricked us all. I only learned the truth after events at the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary."
"228103012-0-66257";"Are you angry with Olik?"
"228103012-0-66260";"Are things resolved between you and the Imperials now?"
"228103012-0-66263";"Why do you think Quistley Silvelle is in this cave?"
"228103012-0-66268";"First tell me if Lyranth is your Dread Lady. That's who wrote the letter."
"228103012-0-66271";"Do you think she's like your brother, or the others?"
"228103012-0-66272";"How can you tell?"
"228103012-0-66273";"What does this cult want with the Blackfeather Court?"
"228103012-0-66274";"How did you end up in Blackwood? That's quite a distance from where we last met."
"228103012-0-66275";"What sort of work are you hiring for?"
"228103012-0-66277";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"228103012-0-66278";"What sorts of things do you need done?"
"228103012-0-66280";"How are these items going to help Leric's luck improve?"
"228103012-0-66281";"Tell me more about this Minotaur."
"228103012-0-66282";"You said you work for the Chamber of Legates?"
"228103012-0-66286";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-66296";"What's an Imperial consul doing in the Reach?"
"228103012-0-66299";"Why are a pair of thieves rescuing hostages?"
"228103012-0-66300";"What was your dream about?"
"228103012-0-66305";"You were under a spell. We woke you up."
"228103012-0-66308";"What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-66311";"Are you sure Renna is here?"
"228103012-0-66313";"Did this Quistley Silvelle run away from home?"
"228103012-0-66314";"Did this Quistley Silvelle run away from home?"
"228103012-0-66315";"Did this Quistley Silvelle run away from home?"
"228103012-0-66316";"Did this Quistley Silvelle run away from home?"
"228103012-0-66317";"Did this Quistley Silvelle run away from home?"
"228103012-0-66322";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66323";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66324";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66326";"Did you tell Tenarei why you were going to Deepscorn?"
"228103012-0-66330";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66331";"It was a success. <<1>> definitely got some sideways looks."
"228103012-0-66333";"I think <<1>> will need a good bath after that."
"228103012-0-66337";"Who's the target?"
"228103012-0-66338";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66339";"You can sense these wards?"
"228103012-0-66341";"The ward was in place until I destroyed it. How could the cultists get in here before us?"
"228103012-0-66342";"What is the Idol of Xulunaht?"
"228103012-0-66343";"What's the prank, and who is the target?"
"228103012-0-66345";"How have you been, Clever?"
"228103012-0-66346";"Why do you like pranks so much?"
"228103012-0-66350";"How have you been, Feathermoth?"
"228103012-0-66352";"Rigurt's not with me this time."
"228103012-0-66353";"What will you do now, Alchemy?"
"228103012-0-66357";"What seems to be the trouble?"
"228103012-0-66367";"Do you have a favorite prank of all time?"
"228103012-0-66374";"What do you plan to do?"
"228103012-0-66375";"What can you tell me about this enchanted lantern?"
"228103012-0-66379";"What do you know about this tragic affair you mentioned before?"
"228103012-0-66382";"So, you're a writer?"
"228103012-0-66384";"Can you tell me more about these Four Winds?"
"228103012-0-66388";"The village needs your help. Bandits have taken everything they own."
"228103012-0-66392";"Will you use them to aid the village?"
"228103012-0-66396";"I found this letter on a body in the wilderness. They said to deliver this letter and ring to you."
"228103012-0-66397";"You want to marry your dead suitor?"
"228103012-0-66403";"Bandits threaten the Stonewastes. Satul-Sa is dead. We request your help."
"228103012-0-66408";"Your parents and Larz-Tul both demand your presence."
"228103012-0-66409";"Your parents and Larz-Tul both demand your presence."
"228103012-0-66410";"Otumi-Ra? Can you hear me?"
"228103012-0-66413";"You heard about Councilor Jirich?"
"228103012-0-66418";"Tell me more about that strange book you found."
"228103012-0-66422";"What'll happen if King Boar eats too many apples?"
"228103012-0-66423";"I need a ticket?"
"228103012-0-66424";"How many fermented mudcrab apples do you need?"
"228103012-0-66426";"What are you thinking?"
"228103012-0-66428";"What if that doesn't work?"
"228103012-0-66431";"We found him, but Ladarah isn't responsible for this curse. Someone else is responsible."
"228103012-0-66433";"Apparently, the spell involved burying Mathen's armor under clumps of heartsbane."
"228103012-0-66435";"I come on behalf of the village. Satul-Sa is dead and they are under attack."
"228103012-0-66441";"If it means you'll join us, I am ready."
"228103012-0-66444";"Are you sure your grandmother wasn't just making up a story?"
"228103012-0-66446";"Why are you so interested in a hero everyone else has forgotten, anyway?"
"228103012-0-66448";"Sombren has an idea, but the twins are losing control of their powers."
"228103012-0-66452";"What are you doing in the Deadlands?"
"228103012-0-66453";"What will the twins learn from these obelisks?"
"228103012-0-66454";"No, thank you. Does this mean you will join us?"
"228103012-0-66458";"You can't give up. We can do this."
"228103012-0-66459";"I'm curious about the relics we're going after."
"228103012-0-66460";"I'm curious about the relics we're going after."
"228103012-0-66462";"I'm curious about the relics we're going after."
"228103012-0-66465";"How did you unlock that cage so easily?"
"228103012-0-66466";"Did you know these people?"
"228103012-0-66468";"What's their plan?"
"228103012-0-66471";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66472";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66479";"What do you need from me?"
"228103012-0-66481";"Why do you want to push this over?"
"228103012-0-66483";"Who was this old foe of Xynaa's?"
"228103012-0-66485";"Why would Xynaa drain your power and toss you down here?"
"228103012-0-66487";"I thought you weren't joining us?"
"228103012-0-66491";"Yes, here. I believe this is it."
"228103012-0-66493";"What's it like to have Eveli as a sister?"
"228103012-0-66494";"What's it like to have Eveli as a sister?"
"228103012-0-66495";"How are we supposed to find the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary?"
"228103012-0-66496";"He told me to use the Phantasmal Censer. After I did, he disappeared."
"228103012-0-66500";"What else do you know about Farrul Lupus?"
"228103012-0-66501";"Tell me more about the book you were sent to retrieve from Black Drake Villa."
"228103012-0-66502";"What do you know about the ones who tried to take you captive?"
"228103012-0-66503";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-66505";"Revus said you know a lot about this sort of thing. Why aren't you helping?"
"228103012-0-66508";"Tell me more about the book you were sent to retrieve from Black Drake Villa."
"228103012-0-66509";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-66510";"You're poisoned? Will you be all right?"
"228103012-0-66514";"I see you've got Bevene. Will she make it?"
"228103012-0-66518";"Cataclysmic results?"
"228103012-0-66522";"Saving her is the right thing to do."
"228103012-0-66523";"Those seeds are worth more than the life of one stranger."
"228103012-0-66527";"Tell me about your wife."
"228103012-0-66529";"So, where will he end up?"
"228103012-0-66530";"The Black Fin Legion needs help defending Fort Redmane against the Order of the Waking Flame."
"228103012-0-66532";"Tell me about this seed we're searching for."
"228103012-0-66533";"You came all the way to Blackwood for this?"
"228103012-0-66534";"What can you tell me about War Chief Zathmoz?"
"228103012-0-66540";"Tell me about the Blackfeather Court."
"228103012-0-66541";"You mean the mirrors?"
"228103012-0-66542";"How did you end up in Blackwood?"
"228103012-0-66543";"What are you?"
"228103012-0-66544";"You mean the mirrors?"
"228103012-0-66545";"You mean the mirrors?"
"228103012-0-66546";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-66547";"Stub conversation."
"228103012-0-66549";"Survey stone?"
"228103012-0-66555";"Tell me more about the Sul-Xan."
"228103012-0-66557";"What's so special about these singing frogs?"
"228103012-0-66559";"A huge Argonian? How huge?"
"228103012-0-66561";"If Ghemvas destroys everyone that ventures within its grasp, what chance do I have?"
"228103012-0-66563";"So what do we do now?"
"228103012-0-66572";"How will I do that?"
"228103012-0-66573";"What will the Blackfeather Court do now?"
"228103012-0-66574";"Your letter mentioned that you had information."
"228103012-0-66588";"Tell me more about the book you were sent to retrieve from Black Drake Villa."
"228103012-0-66589";"The Black Fin Legion needs help defending Fort Redmane from the Order of the Waking Flame."
"228103012-0-66591";"The Black Fin Legion needs help defending Fort Redmane from the Order of the Waking Flame."
"228103012-0-66597";"Stay close to the twins. We think Vandacia is going to try to capture the three of you."
"228103012-0-66598";"That army will protect you from Vandacia and his cultists."
"228103012-0-66599";"Be careful today. Your job is to stay alive and protect your sister."
"228103012-0-66600";"Why leave soldiers behind when this is where Vandacia is going to attack?"
"228103012-0-66601";"Are you sure you don't need me here?"
"228103012-0-66602";"What else have you heard from your scouts about the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"228103012-0-66604";"Do you think Vandacia is still here?"
"228103012-0-66605";"What does this lockbox hold?"
"228103012-0-66612";"Who do you think can help us?"
"228103012-0-66613";"Who do you think can help us?"
"228103012-0-66614";"Who do you think can help us?"
"228103012-0-66616";"How are you feeling after that blow?"
"228103012-0-66620";"Where am I?"
"228103012-0-66622";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-66623";"Where are we headed?"
"228103012-0-66624";"Where are we headed now?"
"228103012-0-66625";"What can we expect to encounter in the Gallery?"
"228103012-0-66626";"Is there any way to fix it?"
"228103012-0-66627";"Can I ask you something before we set out?"
"228103012-0-66629";"What do you mean? Why did it come to life?"
"228103012-0-66631";"Do you plan to use one of the doors as well?"
"228103012-0-66635";"Are you planning on going back to Morrowind soon?"
"228103012-0-66637";"If you are Mehrunes Dagon's enemy, why do you live in his realm?"
"228103012-0-66638";"The letter isn't signed. It asks that we come to the Amnis Manor on the south side of town. Alone."
"228103012-0-66639";"The caretakers didn't tell you anything about your parents?"
"228103012-0-66640";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-66641";"What did the keepers of your vault tell you about your parents?"
"228103012-0-66643";"Does Alchemy usually take an interest in local troubles?"
"228103012-0-66647";"Do you know any more about this attack?"
"228103012-0-66648";"Malosza sent me to aid your people."
"228103012-0-66649";"Tell me more about Rockgrove."
"228103012-0-66650";"Malosza said you were one of the guards."
"228103012-0-66662";"They allowed themselves to be killed to give you that power."
"228103012-0-66663";"You are more than your parents' choices."
"228103012-0-66664";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-66665";"I found some fragments of a burned note in the fireplace. Was that yours?"
"228103012-0-66670";"What was it you were doing there?"
"228103012-0-66674";"I'm here to rescue you."
"228103012-0-66676";"Not a chance. I'm getting you out of here."
"228103012-0-66678";"I'm not going to leave you here."
"228103012-0-66681";"Tell me more about the shrine."
"228103012-0-66682";"Can you tell me anything more about the curse?"
"228103012-0-66684";"What sort of mess are we talking about?"
"228103012-0-66687";"Everything seems normal then? Nothing unusual?"
"228103012-0-66693";"This is a dream, Annyce. You need to wake up."
"228103012-0-66696";"Where is Captain Wereshark?"
"228103012-0-66698";"How did you get down here so quickly?"
"228103012-0-66699";"She wanted to enjoy the dream a little longer. She's part of Captain Wereshark's crew."
"228103012-0-66704";"What do you know about this device?"
"228103012-0-66705";"What happened to Morgane?"
"228103012-0-66708";"Why are you trading places with the people in this town?"
"228103012-0-66715";"Are you still upset about losing the dream?"
"228103012-0-66716";"How you are two getting along?"
"228103012-0-66718";"How are things between you now?"
"228103012-0-66721";"Will you and your sister be all right?"
"228103012-0-66722";"Sounds like you are finally getting along."
"228103012-0-66725";"Oh? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-66727";"How is Bugtail doing?"
"228103012-0-66734";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-66739";"The Ambitions were rattled by what we learned in the Deadlands."
"228103012-0-66740";"Yes, and no. The Ambitions won't be consumed by their power but they're still in danger."
"228103012-0-66741";"What seems to be the trouble?"
"228103012-0-66743";"Any idea what it was they were doing to Eolaf?"
"228103012-0-66747";"Do you think Larz-Tul will fall for this ruse?"
"228103012-0-66749";"What do you hope to find in the concealed chamber?"
"228103012-0-66750";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-66751";"What sort of assistance do you need?"
"228103012-0-66754";"Yes, but it's written in code. Can you decipher it?"
"228103012-0-66755";"Can you tell me anything about the book Eveli found at Black Drake Villa?"
"228103012-0-66756";"Can you tell me anything about the book Eveli found at Black Drake Villa?"
"228103012-0-66757";"Will you be all right hanging on to that strange book?"
"228103012-0-66758";"Will you be all right hanging on to that strange book?"
"228103012-0-66759";"What do you know about Leyawiin?"
"228103012-0-66760";"What's next for you and Stibbons?"
"228103012-0-66761";"Why leave a perfectly good xanmeer empty?"
"228103012-0-66762";"I heard a voice. The Sorcerer Rectavius spoke to me."
"228103012-0-66763";"What did you learn?"
"228103012-0-66768";"Have you ever seen this chapel before?"
"228103012-0-66782";"Did you learn anything else about the sorcerer?"
"228103012-0-66785";"Have you been drinking?"
"228103012-0-66786";"Death, my brother."
"228103012-0-66787";"Death, my brother."
"228103012-0-66790";"What can you tell me about Alchemy?"
"228103012-0-66792";"Have you heard anything about the strange occurrences in Farmer's Nook?"
"228103012-0-66797";"What's next for the two of you?"
"228103012-0-66800";"Will you write about this?"
"228103012-0-66807";"Aren't all Daedra evil?"
"228103012-0-66809";"How are things in Orsinium?"
"228103012-0-66811";"How are you feeling after what happened at Xynaa's sanctuary?"
"228103012-0-66812";"I am sorry for what you went through in the Deadlands."
"228103012-0-66813";"How did you get down here so quickly?"
"228103012-0-66814";"How did you get down here so quickly?"
"228103012-0-66815";"Tell me more about this contact of yours that can break Imperial codes."
"228103012-0-66816";"Tell me more about this contact of yours that can break Imperial codes."

"228103012-0-66827";"Any second thoughts about turning your back on Aetherius?"
"228103012-0-66829";"Has Sombren been able to teach you anything yet?"
"228103012-0-66830";"Saint Pellentine's story probably didn't look quite so rosy when he was in the middle of it."
"228103012-0-66836";"Will you be all right hanging on to that strange book?"
"228103012-0-66837";"How many more of these rituals do you think there are?"
"228103012-0-66845";"What do you think? Should we take Sombren into Gideon?"
"228103012-0-66848";"Who were you arguing with just now?"
"228103012-0-66849";"What do you think about all of this?"

"228103012-0-66859";"Any thoughts on what to do?"
"228103012-0-66860";"I want to ask you some questions."
"228103012-0-66861";"Stay close to the twins. Vandacia might find some way to get at them."
"228103012-0-66863";"Reading about adventures is not the same as living through them. Be careful today."
"228103012-0-66864";"You want me to give a speech?"
"228103012-0-66865";"Can you tell me what I'm supposed to do?"
"228103012-0-66868";"What do you mean by even if it kills her?"

"228103012-0-66938";"What information do you think you'll find in the ledger?"
"228103012-0-66939";"What did you mean that this behemoth was corrupted?"
"228103012-0-66940";"Do you think we've seen the last of Dagon?"
"228103012-0-66941";"What have you been up to since we last saw each other?"

"228103012-0-66969";"What's next for you and Scipion?"
"228103012-0-66976";"Talaise is in the pantry. The assassin murdered her. Pretended to be her to get into the watchtower."

"228103012-0-67028";"What will you do next?"
"228103012-0-67030";"I spoke with the spirits of your apprentices. They showed me how to close the gate."

"228103012-0-67066";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-67068";"What does the future hold for you?"
"228103012-0-67070";"This was once your life not too long ago."
"228103012-0-67075";"Quistley only reaches out to you when he's in trouble?"
"228103012-0-67079";"Dreams? What dreams?"
"228103012-0-67084";"This is Faric Gemain. We've been investigating the murder of Priestess Rolaine."
"228103012-0-67088";"You think she was caught?"
"228103012-0-67093";"Only if we fail."
"228103012-0-67097";"You're not troubled by abandoning the afterlife?"
"228103012-0-67099";"You think we have time for that?"
"228103012-0-67100";"Didn't the Silvelles tell you anything about your family?"
"228103012-0-67103";"We found the ring. Do you have Bastian's letter?"
"228103012-0-67109";"Will Nuxul be all right?"
"228103012-0-67115";"What can you tell me about Naxhosa's bandits?"

"228103012-0-67136";"What's your job?"
"228103012-0-67137";"Who hired you to bring me the letter?"
"228103012-0-67138";"Do you still want to be an adventurer after all this?"
"228103012-0-67141";"What do you make of all this, Bastian?"
"228103012-0-67146";"Why don't you believe her claims?"
"228103012-0-67150";"I heard you were looking for help. Brigadine Antonius sent me."
"228103012-0-67153";"What's next for you and Scipion?"
"228103012-0-67155";"The Dibella priest said Calia and Sombren headed to a ruin outside of Gideon."
"228103012-0-67158";"I found Vinnus in the Deadlands. He left you a note."
"228103012-0-67159";"Why did Vinnus go into the portal if it was so dangerous?"
"228103012-0-67162";"Hello again, Percius. We need attire for a formal event. Can you help us?"
"228103012-0-67163";"What's the Happy Averno Shipping Company?"
"228103012-0-67169";"Faleria has protection and is going to search her records, but I was too late to save Sophus."

"228103012-0-67173";"Sombren, what's going on?"
"228103012-0-67177";"Councilor Abor has been murdered."
"228103012-0-67181";"How do you feel about Sombren taking your book with him?"
"228103012-0-67194";"What's happening in the sky?"
"228103012-0-67196";"Sombren took Calia somewhere to teach her how to control her power where they won't endanger others."
"228103012-0-67203";"Maybe the destruction isn't the point?"
"228103012-0-67204";"Here. It's orders from a Dark Brotherhood matron. They want to establish a sanctuary in the area."
"228103012-0-67208";"Do you have any memories of your sister?"
"228103012-0-67214";"Definitely! You're a famous adventurer now."
"228103012-0-67217";"Tidings about your wife? What's going on?"
"228103012-0-67220";"I know Eveli Sharp-Arrow."
"228103012-0-67221";"We still don't know what ojel-bak means or where to find it, do we?"
"228103012-0-67223";"You sure you want to march into territory full of hostile Argonians?"
"228103012-0-67226";"The count says he did it to protect his wife. And you."
"228103012-0-67229";"Do you think Lord Silvelle would have ever told you about your sister?"
"228103012-0-67240";"Will you and your sister be all right here?"
"228103012-0-67241";"This is really your first time out of the vault?"
"228103012-0-67242";"You must have some opinion on what we should do next."
"228103012-0-67244";"Any idea who sent the courier or what the message is about?"
"228103012-0-67246";"If you didn't kill the councilors, Leyawiin demands to know what you're doing in Blackwood."
"228103012-0-67251";"Do you believe Count Auzin's story?"
"228103012-0-67253";"Tell me more about the situation here in Leyawiin."
"228103012-0-67255";"What happened to me when I approached that skyshard?"
"228103012-0-67261";"What else can you tell me about Councilor Jirich?"
"228103012-0-67262";"Count Auzin told us of the danger you were in."
"228103012-0-67266";"Tiras' voice isn't in your head. I hear it too."
"228103012-0-67270";"What do we do when we find Tiras?"
"228103012-0-67271";"What do you mean, governor?"
"228103012-0-67277";"You seem to be in much better spirits."
"228103012-0-67278";"Remind me about what we know so far."
"228103012-0-67280";"Have you changed your mind about making a stand in Gideon?"
"228103012-0-67284";"She appears as pleased to find you as you are to find her."
"228103012-0-67287";"Its been a while, Eveli. What have you been up to since Orsinium?"
"228103012-0-67288";"I'd like to practice combat again."
"228103012-0-67289";"Right. Sounds like they know where to find one of the Ambitions, too. From Leovic's secret."
"228103012-0-67291";"Sophus is dead, but I managed to warn Faleria."
"228103012-0-67292";"Can you trust Sombren after that?"
"228103012-0-67293";"Sombren thinks he can teach you. At least, he's going to try."
"228103012-0-67294";"Never mind about my outfit, Lyranth. What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-67299";"What's next for Eveli Sharp-Arrow, hero of Blackwood?"
"228103012-0-67300";"I'm sorry about Destron."
"228103012-0-67301";"What's Sombren doing? Why did he bring you out here?"
"228103012-0-67302";"What next for Blackwood, Governor Keshu?"
"228103012-0-67305";"I'd like to know more about your faith."
"228103012-0-67308";"Are the councilors still alive?"
"228103012-0-67311";"I don't think you're being punished."
"228103012-0-67314";"What's the Dark Brotherhood's interest in the council?"
"228103012-0-67318";"Any ideas on how we go about lowering it?"
"228103012-0-67320";"Any thoughts on where we might find clues?"
"228103012-0-67323";"What if it's not there?"
"228103012-0-67324";"I could use your help with locating the sigils."
"228103012-0-67333";"Did the document tell you where to find the Four Ambitions?"
"228103012-0-67335";"This experience seems to have really changed your outlook."
"228103012-0-67338";"What will you and the twins talk about?"
"228103012-0-67346";"Deetum-Jas hired me for the job in Bloodrun Cave."
"228103012-0-67347";"What Dark Elf? What cave?"
"228103012-0-67354";"He claims he was looking for his missing people."
"228103012-0-67355";"He claims he was looking for his missing people."
"228103012-0-67356";"He claims he was looking for his missing people."
"228103012-0-67357";"I rescued him from the cultists. They certainly thought he was an Ambition."
"228103012-0-67359";"I believe so. I rescued him from the cultists before they could sacrifice him."
"228103012-0-67366";"How can you get power out of a skull?"
"228103012-0-67367";"How can you get power out of a skull?"
"228103012-0-67369";"I destroyed all the documents."
"228103012-0-67371";"Is Faves Anthones part of the Morag Tong?"
"228103012-0-67372";"Tell me something about yourself."
"228103012-0-67376";"Deetum-Jas hired me to take notes for you inside the Daedric ruin."
"228103012-0-67380";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-67382";"Did you meet with Irenni Elendis recently?"
"228103012-0-67385";"You don't sound so sure."
"228103012-0-67388";"Here's your inkwell. Is it really that valuable?"
"228103012-0-67391";"At least she's all right."
"228103012-0-67394";"The next time?"
"228103012-0-67395";"Why is this inkwell worth so much trouble to you?"
"228103012-0-67397";"Yes, I took a few notes while inside."
"228103012-0-67399";"Have you ever been to Stormhold?"
"228103012-0-67406";"Who else is attending Keshu's celebration?"
"228103012-0-67407";"What's next for the Ivory Brigade?"
"228103012-0-67409";"Remind me what we're dealing with."
"228103012-0-67410";"Remind me, what are we dealing with again?"
"228103012-0-67411";"Remind me, what are we dealing with again?"
"228103012-0-67412";"It looks like Edvilda was trying to sell your mother false information about a puzzle box."
"228103012-0-67415";"Hope, my brother."
"228103012-0-67416";"Nightmares, my brother."
"228103012-0-67417";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-67418";"Are you two here to steal something?"
"228103012-0-67421";"What's your interest in Sai Sahan?"
"228103012-0-67424";"What are you two doing here?"
"228103012-0-67425";"What's next for Lady Laurent?"
"228103012-0-67426";"So, no lingering effects concerning the voriplasm or your duplicates?"
"228103012-0-67427";"Any word from House Telvanni about our adventures in Veyond?"
"228103012-0-67428";"What's the news from Tel Naga?"
"228103012-0-67429";"You did all you could for him."
"228103012-0-67430";"Any thoughts on why Bahsei needed the xanmeer?"
"228103012-0-67431";"The life of an adventurer is never dull."
"228103012-0-67432";"He's been busy in Blackwood, as you know."
"228103012-0-67433";"Sul-Xan?"
"228103012-0-67434";"What can I expect from Bahsei?"
"228103012-0-67435";"Tell me more about your apprentices."
"228103012-0-67437";"What exactly is the Nightwielder's Tome?"
"228103012-0-67438";"How were things at Farmer's Nook after I left?"
"228103012-0-67440";"How is your own work going?"
"228103012-0-67441";"Why is it your job to perform the last rites for this priest?"
"228103012-0-67442";"What are your plans for Leyawiin now, councilor?"
"228103012-0-67443";"I'm surprised you got invited to this affair."
"228103012-0-67445";"Have you been able to bring Phalevon's legend to light?"
"228103012-0-67446";"How are your friends? Have they recovered?"
"228103012-0-67447";"What are you doing here, duke?"

"228103012-0-67451";"What will you and the village of Stonewastes do now?"
"228103012-0-67455";"How can I even be sure that you're really Nocturnal?"

"228103012-0-67626";"Why are you working for Tumma-Maxath?"
"228103012-0-67627";"You wouldn't happen to know what happened to Nocturnal's Shade Sickle, would you?"

"228103012-0-67648";"We found Arelette for you. Now help us find Onimiril."
"228103012-0-67655";"I found the crow eggs."
"228103012-0-67656";"I found the crow eggs."
"228103012-0-67657";"Onimiril seems to think it's connected to Avanchnzel in the Rift."

"228103012-0-67662";"You don't seem very appreciative of the effort."
"228103012-0-67663";"He certainly knows how to hold a grudge."
"228103012-0-67668";"Once you destroy the eggs, what will you do?"
"228103012-0-67671";"Once you take the eggs somewhere safe, what will you do?"
"228103012-0-67674";"Yes, <<1>> hired me on your behalf."
"228103012-0-67676";"You said these crows have some connection to Nocturnal?"
"228103012-0-67679";"Why did you give up the daggers?"
"228103012-0-67684";"Yes, I destroyed them. That should slow the Sul-Xan down."

"228103012-0-67752";"I made the blessing solution."
"228103012-0-67755";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-67756";"Are you all right now?"

"228103012-0-68134";"Where should I go to look for allies?"
"228103012-0-68135";"Remind me about the Black Fin Legion."
"228103012-0-68147";"Prince Vaugr?"
"228103012-0-68148";"You both went to great lengths to escape your lot in life."
"228103012-0-68153";"Who protects Stonewastes while you're here?"
"228103012-0-68155";"Have you kept busy since the battle of Stonewastes?"
"228103012-0-68156";"What are your plans now?"
"228103012-0-68157";"How have you fared since our last meeting?"
"228103012-0-68158";"Your legend will also grow from this."
"228103012-0-68183";"Who is this Im-Makka?"
"228103012-0-68187";"I saw more souls rise up when Sul-Xan killed some captives."
"228103012-0-68190";"What next for Blackwood, Governor Keshu?"
"228103012-0-68191";"What next for Blackwood, Governor Keshu?"
"228103012-0-68192";"What are you doing here, duke?"
"228103012-0-68193";"Is the real Stibbons in any danger?"
"228103012-0-68195";"Yes. And one we'll pass."
"228103012-0-68197";"Do you think you'll be able to make peace with your father?"
"228103012-0-68200";"Tell me more about the Knights of the Silver Rose."
"228103012-0-68201";"Do you know where the knights have taken your relics?"
"228103012-0-68202";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-68203";"What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-68204";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-68212";"Didn't we meet in the Gold Coast?"
"228103012-0-68213";"Didn't we meet in Southern Elsweyr?"
"228103012-0-68214";"Did they mention anything about the items from your temple?"
"228103012-0-68215";"You're willing to besiege a fortress for one of these items yourself."
"228103012-0-68219";"Any idea what we should expect?"
"228103012-0-68220";"Are you going to leave the moment you have what you want?"
"228103012-0-68221";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-68222";"How were you able to cleanse the area?"
"228103012-0-68223";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-68224";"What's so important about this artifact you're seeking?"
"228103012-0-68225";"What was it you gave to Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-68226";"What will you do now that this is over?"
"228103012-0-68227";"Just what are you planning?"
"228103012-0-68228";"What's that item supposed to do?"
"228103012-0-68229";"flv 1"
"228103012-0-68230";"flv 2"
"228103012-0-68231";"flv 3"
"228103012-0-68232";"Tell me more about nymics."
"228103012-0-68235";"The Longhouse Emperors had a plan to banish Dagon with something called the egonymic."
"228103012-0-68237";"Tell me about what brought you out here."
"228103012-0-68238";"What can you tell me about the Dread Cellar?"
"228103012-0-68239";"What is the Battlespire?"
"228103012-0-68240";"Here's the effigy."
"228103012-0-68242";"Who are you two?"
"228103012-0-68243";"What can you tell me about our mission?"
"228103012-0-68244";"How is your injury?"
"228103012-0-68248";"We found this in your vault. Do you know what it is?"
"228103012-0-68251";"Any idea why it's broken?"
"228103012-0-68253";"The monster was siphoning energy from them before I killed it."
"228103012-0-68254";"What are you doing here, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-68255";"What makes you want to subject yourself to that?"
"228103012-0-68258";"How will the pendant reveal Lyranth's hidden lair?"
"228103012-0-68261";"Your guess is as good as mine."
"228103012-0-68262";"How did Pibiha get kidnapped by the Waking Flame?"
"228103012-0-68263";"Remind me. What's going on, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-68266";"Lyranth said she asked you to look through the Longhouse Emperors' documents? Did you find anything?"
"228103012-0-68267";"Its misery?"
"228103012-0-68270";"We're real. What do you mean about needing life?"
"228103012-0-68273";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-68274";"What happened here, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-68277";"No. All I found was this letter."
"228103012-0-68281";"How do we find the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"228103012-0-68283";"I was told you might have a tincture of befuddlement for purchase."
"228103012-0-68285";"I assume there's more to your plan than just the potion of disguise?"
"228103012-0-68286";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-68287";"What does the letter signify?"
"228103012-0-68293";"Do you want me to call off the ritual?"
"228103012-0-68295";"What's your history with the Dread Cellar?"
"228103012-0-68296";"How would knowing his past have made a difference in your mission?"
"228103012-0-68301";"Fargrave? Never heard of the place."
"228103012-0-68304";"I assumed the order would appreciate a gift of this magnitude."
"228103012-0-68306";"The portal key and Lyranth. For you, Sister Celdina."
"228103012-0-68308";"The enchanted blade Sister Celdina provided incapacitated Lyranth, just as we planned."
"228103012-0-68315";"I just returned, acolyte. What's happening here at the base?"
"228103012-0-68316";"Seeing as I just returned, care to enlighten me about what's going on here at the base?"
"228103012-0-68317";"Nokvroz? Is he someone important?"
"228103012-0-68320";"Do you know Valkynaz Nokvroz?"
"228103012-0-68321";"What was it like when the cataclyst was activated?"
"228103012-0-68322";"What are we looking for exactly?"
"228103012-0-68324";"This potion you plan to create will make me look just like the dead cultist?"
"228103012-0-68326";"How did you know about all this to begin with?"
"228103012-0-68328";"How do I craft the effigy?"
"228103012-0-68330";"What is the Witchmother coven?"
"228103012-0-68332";"We still have the memory vessel. Maybe Madam Whim can make sense of the memories we gathered."
"228103012-0-68335";"Here's the memory vessel."
"228103012-0-68339";"Can you tell me about your investigations?"
"228103012-0-68348";"Do you want to talk about these new memories?"
"228103012-0-68349";"Here's the effigy."
"228103012-0-68351";"Do you feel any responsibility for this?"
"228103012-0-68352";"You two were close before this?"
"228103012-0-68355";"You found their stronghold? You found Deadlight?"
"228103012-0-68358";"Tell me more about your clan."
"228103012-0-68359";"What should I know about Rynkyus?"
"228103012-0-68362";"I found a portal key and the instructions, yes."
"228103012-0-68363";"Are you … studying?"
"228103012-0-68367";"We came here to find the souls of the Longhouse Emperors. Any thoughts on how to set them free?"
"228103012-0-68371";"Here's the man's journal. The Ravener drained him for its hunt."
"228103012-0-68372";"Familiar? You've been here before?"
"228103012-0-68374";"Emperor Moricar? I need to ask you about your daughter."
"228103012-0-68380";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-68385";"I found a Bladebearer sword at Burning Gyre Keep, along with Nokvroz and the Waking Flame cultists."
"228103012-0-68386";"That's what Emperor Moricar's spirit told us."
"228103012-0-68390";"What can you tell me about Jynd and Zynoahz?"
"228103012-0-68394";"Why did you destroy the souls of the emperors? We could have learned more from them."
"228103012-0-68397";"What do you mean, intense?"
"228103012-0-68398";"You mentioned a strange book. Tell me about it."
"228103012-0-68401";"It sounded like they perfected the cataclyst process."
"228103012-0-68408";"What should I be looking for in the gaol?"
"228103012-0-68410";"What are we looking for here?"
"228103012-0-68411";"Zynoahz is trying to duplicate the cult's plans. Nokvroz wants to build his own cataclyst."
"228103012-0-68414";"Shouldn't you come with us?"
"228103012-0-68418";"I explored a good deal of it."
"228103012-0-68421";"This ring looks like a companion piece to the Anchorite's amulet."
"228103012-0-68426";"Why do you want to know?"
"228103012-0-68427";"Why is Tephilaz so crucial to Wretched Spire's peace?"
"228103012-0-68430";"Tell me more about Wretched Spire."
"228103012-0-68433";"What makes you so invested in keeping the peace?"
"228103012-0-68436";"How do you know we're headed the right way?"
"228103012-0-68437";"We defeated Sister Celdina, but Valkynaz Nokvroz captured the Anchorite."
"228103012-0-68440";"What are you going to do?"
"228103012-0-68448";"Sombren used his power to access this hidden chamber, but he couldn't open that chest over there."
"228103012-0-68455";"I saw some of your memories in this room."
"228103012-0-68456";"What do you mean, Sombren has turned to Mehrunes Dagon?"
"228103012-0-68462";"Jynd is trying to duplicate the cult's plans. Nokvroz wants to build his own cataclyst."
"228103012-0-68467";"How does devouring Atrozu accomplish that?"
"228103012-0-68469";"What kind of signs are you looking for?"
"228103012-0-68471";"Why do you need to return to Fargrave?"
"228103012-0-68475";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68477";"What happens after you kill the Ravener?"
"228103012-0-68478";"What are you doing here, Rogatina?"
"228103012-0-68480";"If Lyranth has you, why does she need my help?"
"228103012-0-68487";"I'm interested. Tell me about these jobs."
"228103012-0-68488";"You said you work for House Hexos?"
"228103012-0-68492";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-68493";"What's an Imperial consul doing in the Reach?"
"228103012-0-68494";"What's an Imperial consul doing in the Reach?"
"228103012-0-68496";"Who are the Gleaners?"
"228103012-0-68497";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"228103012-0-68498";"What's your job?"
"228103012-0-68499";"Do we have other options?"
"228103012-0-68501";"Inscribe runes? For what?"
"228103012-0-68505";"We attuned the Mother Stones, what next?"
"228103012-0-68506";"Why do we need to find an altar?"
"228103012-0-68510";"How do you feel?"
"228103012-0-68512";"Let's do this."
"228103012-0-68513";"What's the Blood Pit? And how do you know Elegian?"
"228103012-0-68514";"How did Lyranth help you remember something?"
"228103012-0-68519";"Are you aware that someone murdered Tephilaz?"
"228103012-0-68525";"Having second thoughts? I figured you'd be eager to find out what Elegian knows about your past."
"228103012-0-68530";"You think his rambling words are some sort of clue?"
"228103012-0-68532";"Ask"
"228103012-0-68533";"We're looking for the Riven Cataclyst. Can you help us?"
"228103012-0-68537";"We found Elegian. He told us we can find the Riven Cataclyst by going to Annihilarch's Summit."
"228103012-0-68540";"Do you think you might have been imprisoned here?"
"228103012-0-68543";"What makes you say that?"
"228103012-0-68544";"We found a memory stone in the 4th Vault. Lyranth believes you can access its contents."
"228103012-0-68549";"What if Sister Celdina has already created an army of Incarnates?"
"228103012-0-68551";"What's the first thing you remember?"
"228103012-0-68552";"Have you been to Annilhilarch's Summit?"
"228103012-0-68553";"Do you have any idea how Nokvroz changed you into this form?"
"228103012-0-68557";"So we can only free one spirit?"
"228103012-0-68558";"So you think you can steal the power from Sombren?"
"228103012-0-68569";"Vontan is dead. He was dying when I found him."
"228103012-0-68571";"Were you able to decipher those symbols?"
"228103012-0-68578";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68579";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68580";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68581";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68582";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68588";"What do you think we'll face on the climb to the top?"
"228103012-0-68590";"What other threats are you expecting us to face?"
"228103012-0-68592";"Tell me about the mortal blood."
"228103012-0-68599";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68600";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68602";"Wouldn't Nokvroz's fortress be protected against a portal key used by the Waking Flame?"
"228103012-0-68603";"What can you tell me about Ardent Hope?"
"228103012-0-68606";"What's my fortune?"
"228103012-0-68607";"What's my fortune?"
"228103012-0-68608";"What's my fortune?"
"228103012-0-68609";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-68610";"What's my fortune?"
"228103012-0-68611";"You think this will be enough?"
"228103012-0-68612";"We need this portal key attuned to get us inside Ardent Hope."
"228103012-0-68617";"What's our plan, Lyranth?"
"228103012-0-68619";"Do you think we stand a chance?"
"228103012-0-68620";"We'll do our best."
"228103012-0-68621";"Do you know what the abomination was?"
"228103012-0-68622";"What happens to the Dread Cellar now?"
"228103012-0-68623";"Do you think you and Lucilla will reconcile?"
"228103012-0-68624";"What will you do next?"
"228103012-0-68625";"Will you ever forgive Martus?"
"228103012-0-68628";"Maybe he wanted this."
"228103012-0-68630";"Then why work with the Waking Flame cultists? Why kill those people?"
"228103012-0-68632";"Who are you, exactly?"
"228103012-0-68634";"You said something about a pocket realm?"
"228103012-0-68636";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-68638";"Any advice for us, Madam Whim?"
"228103012-0-68639";"We're not done yet, Lyranth. Where are the others?"
"228103012-0-68644";"Tell me more about the Dread Lady."
"228103012-0-68646";"He said we could find the Riven Cataclyst by going to Annihilarch's Summit."
"228103012-0-68649";"Why do you hate the Daedra residents so much?"
"228103012-0-68653";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-68664";"A key of of some sort. It's covered in runes."
"228103012-0-68667";"Yes, you have, but we need to reach the summit now."
"228103012-0-68668";"How do you talk to Atrozu?"
"228103012-0-68671";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-68672";"What does the magic stored in the twisted rod do?"
"228103012-0-68678";"What happens once we step through that portal?"
"228103012-0-68681";"You really hate Valkynaz Nokvroz, don't you, Arox?"
"228103012-0-68684";"You're going to lose a lot of your clan in this battle, Rynkyus."
"228103012-0-68688";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-68689";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-68694";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68695";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68696";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68697";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68698";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68699";"Rogatina said the situation was apocalyptic. Care to explain?"
"228103012-0-68700";"Any idea who might be helping the Dagon cult?"
"228103012-0-68701";"Can you make sense of those symbols I found at Vontan's hovel?"
"228103012-0-68702";"Tell us what happened to you, Dothaz."
"228103012-0-68724";"What more do you know about Vontan?"
"228103012-0-68745";"Noroth asked me to check for any mortal witnesses of Tephilaz's death."
"228103012-0-68751";"Why do we need these specific vintages?"
"228103012-0-68752";"I know Lyranth. It's not like her to not show up for a meeting."
"228103012-0-68755";"Not interested in trading souls, but what's the matter with that person sitting on the floor?"
"228103012-0-68758";"The Anchorite sent me. What can you tell me about the Waking Flame and their votive runes?"
"228103012-0-68759";"Madam Whim said Lyranth is searching the Shambles for the cult's local leader, Sister Celdina."
"228103012-0-68760";"Why do you think there's another way to get inside the bathhouse?"
"228103012-0-68761";"Crystals? What are you talking about?"
"228103012-0-68762";"I'm <<1>> and this is the Anchorite. She thought you wanted to meet at Fargrave's southern gate."
"228103012-0-68765";"I stopped the ritual, but Sister Celdina escaped."
"228103012-0-68766";"What sort of business is the House of Whims?"
"228103012-0-68767";"Someplace hot? That's not a lot to go on."
"228103012-0-68768";"Tell me more about the Shambles."
"228103012-0-68770";"I found this note. I can't make sense of it."
"228103012-0-68771";"I found this strange note."
"228103012-0-68772";"Madam Whim sent us. She said your collection might contain something to decipher a Dagonic code."
"228103012-0-68773";"Are you sure about this?"
"228103012-0-68774";"Will the Anchorite be all right by herself?"
"228103012-0-68775";"We think this note is written in code. It belonged to Sister Celdina."
"228103012-0-68776";"You seem reluctant to deal with Madam Whim. Why?"

"228103012-0-69253";"Skoedal said he was going to kill you and Madam Whim once Uxark and the rest of her clan return."
"228103012-0-69257";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-69259";"Why are these defenses shutdown?"

"228103012-0-70139";"Excuse me? I don't understand."
"228103012-0-70149";"You seemed concerned that the Ravener spoke. What does it matter?"

"228103012-0-70169";"Tufeh, you made it to Fargrave?"
"228103012-0-70171";"Who are you hiding from?"
"228103012-0-70175";"Are you talking to yourself?"
"228103012-0-70178";"How do you plan to do that?"
"228103012-0-70181";"Madam Whim said you paid the price for this information. What did it cost us?"

"228103012-0-70211";"What did Lord Leobert do?"
"228103012-0-70215";"Remind me about using the lucents."
"228103012-0-70220";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-70223";"What are you looking for?"
"228103012-0-70225";"Three ships never arrived at Gonfalon Bay. Have you seen anything?"
"228103012-0-70228";"Robber knights?"
"228103012-0-70231";"What are the vulk'esh?"
"228103012-0-70232";"Tell me about your wife."
"228103012-0-70233";"What's so important about these vulk'esh scoria?"
"228103012-0-70235";"After rogue knights darkened the beacon, the keeper spotted three ships before the storm rolled in."

"228103012-0-70252";"What's the blessed awl?"
"228103012-0-70253";"Tell me what happened."
"228103012-0-70262";"Tarazka mentioned the Ascendant Order."

"228103012-0-70306";"What will you be doing?"
"228103012-0-70307";"You think some of the others may turn on us?"
"228103012-0-70310";"But where do we find her treasure?"

"228103012-0-70403";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-70404";"Where are we?"
"228103012-0-70409";"The Gilded Lute of Sir Brenvale is yours. How are you feeling?"
"228103012-0-70419";"The dispelling powder was made by the mage who created the medallions. It's safe."
"228103012-0-70422";"We've got the hilt, and the Iron Knot's trial is complete. You must be pleased."
"228103012-0-70433";"Can you tell me more about Whalefall?"
"228103012-0-70434";"Yes, I'm acting as her second. She said you used to know her as a child?"
"228103012-0-70436";"Did you see the list of guests?"
"228103012-0-70439";"Here, I retrieved the blessed awl."
"228103012-0-70442";"The cookpot to the campfire?"
"228103012-0-70444";"flv 1"
"228103012-0-70445";"flv 2"
"228103012-0-70446";"flv 3"
"228103012-0-70447";"How do Jakarn and I get off the island once we find the alliance leaders?"
"228103012-0-70448";"What else should I know about Amenos?"
"228103012-0-70449";"Remind me what we're doing here again."
"228103012-0-70450";"Perhaps one of your competitors?"
"228103012-0-70451";"Lady Arabelle wants us to go with you. We need to get to Amenos without being noticed."
"228103012-0-70455";"The Ascendant Order altered the medallions. Delric was killed when he put on his medallion."
"228103012-0-70457";"You don't recognize Jailer Mannick's name?"
"228103012-0-70459";"How will you and Anton survive on your own?"
"228103012-0-70461";"Are you stuck in there?"
"228103012-0-70462";"How did you end up here?"
"228103012-0-70466";"How do we get to the dock in the south?"
"228103012-0-70468";"Why do you think Lady Arabelle is in danger?"
"228103012-0-70471";"Yes. Here you go, I'll slide it under the door."
"228103012-0-70474";"Isobel and I are trying to enter the catacombs. But we can't find a key."
"228103012-0-70477";"Actually, I need to give you this poem to get the key. It was a weird conversation."
"228103012-0-70478";"I'm looking for a key to the catacombs."
"228103012-0-70479";"Actually, I need a key to the catacombs. Do you have one?"
"228103012-0-70480";"I gave her the poem. She blushed and said she would read it later."
"228103012-0-70481";"Are you here to talk to your mother?"
"228103012-0-70491";"How do you know what Zenithar wants from you?"
"228103012-0-70496";"I guess destroying the idols and tome was enough to break the curse."
"228103012-0-70497";"What if it's still not enough to buy a ship of your own?"
"228103012-0-70498";"Praying to Zenithar isn't necessary?"
"228103012-0-70499";"How do you know Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-70503";"I think it had a clue about Redheart. Oldstone Woods?"
"228103012-0-70506";"What's your idea?"
"228103012-0-70509";"Valessea contacted us. Said she couldn't reach you. The medallions, the order altered them."
"228103012-0-70512";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-70517";"What did you hear, Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-70522";"I have some questions before I release you."
"228103012-0-70524";"How did Amunara's hirelings wreck the trial?"
"228103012-0-70525";"Why would the Ascendant Order kidnap Dockmaster Arnauld when they'd already bribed him?"
"228103012-0-70530";"Do you think anyone else is secretly working for the Ascendant Order?"
"228103012-0-70533";"Eldertide bastards?"
"228103012-0-70534";"TOC"
"228103012-0-70535";"TOC"
"228103012-0-70539";"I gave you the dispelling powder. Didn't you use it yet?"
"228103012-0-70542";"I'm not here to fight you. You're Caska, right? Za'ji has been very worried about you."
"228103012-0-70544";"We know the Ascendant Order has been attacking people all across High Isle."
"228103012-0-70547";"I was happy to help."
"228103012-0-70554";"Why do we need rare vintages?"
"228103012-0-70562";"Your retainers were killed. I found these orders from the Ascendant Magus."
"228103012-0-70564";"Your retainers were killed. I found these orders from the Ascendant Magus."
"228103012-0-70566";"Why hold the banquet without the guests of honor?"
"228103012-0-70569";"What do these wards normally do?"
"228103012-0-70570";"What is next for me?"
"228103012-0-70572";"Do you often take over festivals like this?"
"228103012-0-70575";"Tell me more about the Society of the Steadfast."
"228103012-0-70579";"Lord Bacaro said several nobles will be in attendance."
"228103012-0-70581";"What kind of plan, Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-70585";"I want to request the song Stagger and Sway."
"228103012-0-70590";"Lady Arabelle sent me to find you and the other alliance leaders."
"228103012-0-70594";"We still need to find High King Emeric and Prince Irnskar."
"228103012-0-70597";"Lady Arabelle sent me to find you and the other alliance leaders."
"228103012-0-70600";"You're aware of the Ascendant Order?"
"228103012-0-70603";"Tell me more about House Mornard."
"228103012-0-70604";"Tell me more about House Dufort."
"228103012-0-70605";"That's right, I'm helping Lady Arabelle. How did you know?"
"228103012-0-70606";"We found a note from the Green Serpent leader."
"228103012-0-70609";"That's right, I'm helping Lady Arabelle. You're well informed."
"228103012-0-70615";"Adistair asked me to give this to you."
"228103012-0-70616";"I think she was pleased."
"228103012-0-70619";"Duchess Elea has been investigating the Ascendant Order. I have her notes."
"228103012-0-70622";"Any ideas on how we get inside?"
"228103012-0-70631";"I'm here with High King Emeric and Queen Ayrenn. We came to rescue you."
"228103012-0-70635";"How many people knew about the plans to transport the alliance leaders to High Isle?"
"228103012-0-70639";"What's the Evergrowth?"
"228103012-0-70640";"Why do I need a rune of compulsion?"
"228103012-0-70641";"Why do I need a rune of compulsion?"
"228103012-0-70643";"How do we protect the delegates until the peace talks?"
"228103012-0-70645";"Good work, Jakarn. Do you know where we can find him?"
"228103012-0-70650";"You accepted bribes from the Ascendant Order. You got yourself into this."
"228103012-0-70661";"Are you sure you want to investigate the cave in person?"
"228103012-0-70662";"The alliance leaders aren't safe here at Mandrake Manor?"
"228103012-0-70663";"Remind me. What's happening on High Isle again?"
"228103012-0-70664";"Sergeant Brusic sent me to find you and the prisoners."
"228103012-0-70666";"NYI"
"228103012-0-70667";"How do you want to proceed?"
"228103012-0-70668";"What did Amunara do to you?"
"228103012-0-70673";"I found a book that mentions a wind spirit associated with the motes in this area."
"228103012-0-70677";"How can you be sure the counterspell won't make things worse?"
"228103012-0-70687";"I'm sorry, Rayan."
"228103012-0-70690";"What sort of arcane disturbance?"
"228103012-0-70694";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-70696";"You mentioned tales of your exploits before. Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-70697";"Tell me about this ritual you're going to perform."
"228103012-0-70698";"I am. What do I have to do?"
"228103012-0-70701";"How do you know Bacaro Volorus?"
"228103012-0-70702";"Who exactly are you?"
"228103012-0-70705";"Do you know anything about the corruption spreading through the grove?"
"228103012-0-70708";"I'm aware. Mender Senna sent me to help."
"228103012-0-70709";"There's also a partially destroyed note about experimenting with volcanic energy."
"228103012-0-70715";"How do you know Bacaro Volorus?"
"228103012-0-70716";"What's so important about these Vulk'esh scales?"
"228103012-0-70718";"How do you want to do this, Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-70719";"This is all the archdruid's fault?"
"228103012-0-70724";"I'm prepared. What do I need to do?"
"228103012-0-70729";"You said you could help us stop this."
"228103012-0-70731";"How do we get into the Undergrove?"
"228103012-0-70732";"What do you think the Ascendant Magus is planning?"
"228103012-0-70733";"Do you know who he is underneath that helm?"
"228103012-0-70734";"Why do you dislike High King Emeric so much?"
"228103012-0-70735";"I received this summons. I'm supposed to be at that meeting."
"228103012-0-70742";"I'm looking into Mender Roslenn's disappearance."
"228103012-0-70748";"Who are <<1>> and <<2>>, exactly?"
"228103012-0-70749";"Tell me more about Oblan."
"228103012-0-70750";"I found this journal."
"228103012-0-70751";"We're looking for a missing scepter."
"228103012-0-70755";"I'm <<1>>, and I'm helping Rigurt. What happened last night?"
"228103012-0-70757";"I'm here with Rigurt the Brash. Can you tell me what happened?"
"228103012-0-70762";"How?"
"228103012-0-70764";"How does the Spoon of Undo work?"
"228103012-0-70770";"Jimila said you probably found trouble."
"228103012-0-70771";"How did you get yourself in this situation?"
"228103012-0-70774";"You must be Meryline's father."
"228103012-0-70775";"I'm trying to help this Khajiit and his captain find their missing ship."
"228103012-0-70776";"Where can I find the items you asked for?"
"228103012-0-70782";"Yes, I found everything you asked for."
"228103012-0-70783";"How did you come to be on this island?"
"228103012-0-70786";"We learned that traitors placed lodestones on the ships to draw the storm to the vessels."
"228103012-0-70790";"Who was returned to you?"
"228103012-0-70793";"I'm looking for a healer named Roslenn."
"228103012-0-70796";"Master Healer Viralaine drugged you. You've been sleeping for some time."
"228103012-0-70799";"Do you really think you can cure a Vampire?"
"228103012-0-70800";"Do you think you'll be all right?"
"228103012-0-70801";"Roslenn doesn't remember all of what happened, but she seems all right."
"228103012-0-70809";"You've looked better, Jakarn. Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-70812";"How will you get your prisoners out of here without a ship?"
"228103012-0-70814";"What's your history with Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-70815";"Why didn't you go in after the Ascendant Order when you saw they had a prisoner?"
"228103012-0-70816";"Is this the supply caravan?"
"228103012-0-70820";"No, he didn't."
"228103012-0-70825";"What do you hope to accomplish, Magus?"
"228103012-0-70828";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-70835";"What else do you remember about last night?"
"228103012-0-70836";"We met him, too. The Ascendant Magus is Count Damard Dufort. But he got away."
"228103012-0-70839";"Count Damard is a member of the Ascendant Order. He plans to seize the Silver Swan."
"228103012-0-70841";"Tell me what happened, duchess."
"228103012-0-70843";"Count Damard told the steward to take command of another ship and sail to All Flags Islet."
"228103012-0-70844";"Why is that the bad news?"
"228103012-0-70845";"Were those crystals glowing?"

"228103012-0-70899";"Why didn't you wait for me?"
"228103012-0-70902";"I still have the supplies."

"228103012-0-70915";"Tell me about your husband."
"228103012-0-70916";"Why did you push to accompany me?"
"228103012-0-70924";"Actually, I'd like to enter the prison stockade."
"228103012-0-70925";"What's so important about these Vulk'esh scales?"

"228103012-0-70962";"NYI"
"228103012-0-70964";"Wait. Your wife is worried about you. She hired me to find you and get you to an extraction point."
"228103012-0-70968";"Can you tell me anything more about <<1>>'s special drink?"
"228103012-0-70970";"I believe this is all a mistake. <<1>> really is a diplomat."

"228103012-0-71067";"Did you talk with High King Emeric and Prince Irnskar before the attack on All Flags Islet?"
"228103012-0-71068";"You really think Jorunn the Skald-King will be disappointed he wasn't here for all this?"
"228103012-0-71069";"Since we learned that the Ascendant Magus is Count Damard, will you punish House Dufort?"
"228103012-0-71074";"You don't seem too upset that your wife betrayed you."
"228103012-0-71075";"Remind me about that author thing."

"228103012-0-71093";"Are you really leaving, Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-71099";"Are you sure you're all right traveling with me? You clearly don't think highly of Dunmer."

"228103012-0-71108";"I'm looking for a Pahmar you may have working here."

"228103012-0-71112";"You don't think there's a chance these peace talks will succeed?"
"228103012-0-71113";"What happened to you?"
"228103012-0-71117";"I have all the vulk'esh scoria I could find. I'll give them to you outside."
"228103012-0-71118";"What's next for you, Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-71121";"We need to get you and the other leaders to Memorial Hall. The wards there can protect us."
"228103012-0-71125";"It's good to see you again, Jakarn. What have you been up to since we last saw each other?"
"228103012-0-71126";"You and the other leaders need to retreat to Memorial Hall."
"228103012-0-71132";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-71135";"Here's the bracelet."
"228103012-0-71137";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-71139";"How do you want to do this?"
"228103012-0-71142";"Ember has been searching for you for a long time. Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-71144";"Do you remember what happened the day you were taken?"
"228103012-0-71147";"I followed him to his house and found his cache. Here's proof."
"228103012-0-71149";"The innkeeper won't give the scepter back to Rigurt until someone pays last night's tab."
"228103012-0-71151";"How does Jhaka know how to track down mercenaries?"
"228103012-0-71155";"Ember said you have a lead about the mercenaries who kidnapped you."
"228103012-0-71158";"I need information about an old band of mercenaries, Kestrin's Blades."
"228103012-0-71159";"Now can you tell us what you remember about the Skywatch job?"
"228103012-0-71160";"Ember wanted to find you."
"228103012-0-71161";"Player Ask"
"228103012-0-71170";"Can Rigurt have his scepter of office back, then?"
"228103012-0-71171";"You honestly don't understand the cause of all this trouble?"
"228103012-0-71173";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-71174";"Tell me more about Y'ffelon and Mount Firesong."
"228103012-0-71175";"How was Anton selected for the game at Whalefall?"
"228103012-0-71176";"You wouldn't take revenge yourself?"
"228103012-0-71177";"What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-71179";"What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-71180";"I'm still not sure what happened here."
"228103012-0-71182";"Is last night coming back to you now?"
"228103012-0-71184";"Didn't you even look in the bag Rigurt gave you?"
"228103012-0-71186";"So what happened here?"
"228103012-0-71188";"Your father wants you to stay in his tent."
"228103012-0-71193";"King Fahara'jad is looking for Song?"
"228103012-0-71195";"Are you hurt?"
"228103012-0-71198";"Any thoughts on the Emerald Eye?"
"228103012-0-71200";"We know Song's family runs the Emerald Eye and we heard about some kind of ritual."
"228103012-0-71202";"If you knew all of this, why haven't you tried to rescue Song yourself?"
"228103012-0-71204";"The Emerald Eye might put up a fight."
"228103012-0-71205";"They're keeping Song in some place called the Motalion Necropolis."
"228103012-0-71208";"Do you have doubts about finding Song?"
"228103012-0-71215";"Why did you run in here by yourself?"
"228103012-0-71220";"Are you Azamel? We're looking for a woman named Song."
"228103012-0-71228";"What did that relic actually do?"
"228103012-0-71232";"Is something wrong?"
"228103012-0-71235";"What's Brokerock Mine?"
"228103012-0-71236";"What is Bad Blood Mine?"
"228103012-0-71237";"What is Bad Blood Mine?"
"228103012-0-71238";"What is Bad Blood Mine?"
"228103012-0-71239";"Why would you need an escort?"
"228103012-0-71241";"It sounds like you and your father don't get along."
"228103012-0-71242";"It sounds like you and your father don't get along."
"228103012-0-71244";"What more can you tell me about the Hadolids?"
"228103012-0-71246";"You said there were strange noises and missing guards in?"
"228103012-0-71248";"What will happen to the mine now?"
"228103012-0-71249";"What will happen to the mine now?"
"228103012-0-71252";"Is that what you want to do in the future?"
"228103012-0-71253";"Is that what you want to do in the future?"
"228103012-0-71254";"Is that what you want to do in the future?"
"228103012-0-71258";"The Ascendant Magus was Count Damard Dufort."
"228103012-0-71260";"Do you think any of the alliance leaders will refuse the invitation?"
"228103012-0-71261";"How do I convince the delegates to stay?"
"228103012-0-71263";"So we just destroy them?"
"228103012-0-71264";"Will King Jorunn be angry about what's happened here?"
"228103012-0-71276";"You don't …? Nevermind. I'm looking for a Dark Elf named Kiv. Has he been here?"
"228103012-0-71278";"You want to go after him?"
"228103012-0-71280";"Actually we're looking for a guy named Kiv Lindres. You know him?"
"228103012-0-71281";"Did you talk with High King Emeric and Prince Irnskar before the attack on All Flags Isle?"
"228103012-0-71283";"What will you do about House Dufort?"
"228103012-0-71284";"Are you here on behalf of the Abbey?"
"228103012-0-71287";"We learned that Count Damard Dufort was the Ascendant Knight."
"228103012-0-71290";"No, but I did find this scroll."
"228103012-0-71297";"How is the Abbey?"
"228103012-0-71300";"Deep druids?"
"228103012-0-71301";"Are you going to talk to her about the treasure?"
"228103012-0-71302";"Isobel got your letter. Were you injured?"
"228103012-0-71304";"Sorry, who are you?"
"228103012-0-71308";"Tarazka mentioned the Ascendant Order."
"228103012-0-71311";"I found this map piece near <<1>>'s body."
"228103012-0-71312";"What do you need the map pieces for?"
"228103012-0-71313";"I found this piece of a map on Ferone's body."
"228103012-0-71314";"A note on <<1>>'s body led me to this piece of a map."
"228103012-0-71315";"What more can you tell me about the treasure?"
"228103012-0-71329";"What's happened? Where is she?"
"228103012-0-71330";"Hard to believe his poetry didn't win Aurelia over."
"228103012-0-71334";"Are you a devotee of Zenithar?"
"228103012-0-71337";"Take me to Mournhold."
"228103012-0-71338";"Take me to Wayrest."
"228103012-0-71339";"Take me to Elden Root."
"228103012-0-71340";"How do you know Jakarn?"
"228103012-0-71341";"You fought in a war?"
"228103012-0-71342";"Lady Laurent, are you all right?"
"228103012-0-71345";"What do you remember about Tobin Moorcroft?"
"228103012-0-71348";"What do you want?"
"228103012-0-71351";"The trees attacked you?"
"228103012-0-71354";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-71355";"Can you tell us any more about Kiv?"
"228103012-0-71359";"Was that the bloodmage you were fighting?"
"228103012-0-71360";"Are you Julles Laurdon? We're trying to track down Kiv Lindres."
"228103012-0-71368";"What do you want?"
"228103012-0-71369";"Um, all right."
"228103012-0-71376";"Um, remind me, captain. Which vessel is yours again?"
"228103012-0-71378";"What attacked the two of you?"
"228103012-0-71379";"What do you want?"
"228103012-0-71380";"Stibbons? That's not you, is it?"
"228103012-0-71388";"Yes. But Stibbons and I ended the curse. How do you feel now?"
"228103012-0-71392";"How can we trust you, Kiv?"
"228103012-0-71397";"Do you think the Ascendant Order followed you out here?"
"228103012-0-71398";"What have you been up to since we last met?"
"228103012-0-71399";"What if this is a trap?"
"228103012-0-71400";"Yes. What's the plan?"
"228103012-0-71405";"So this weapon will be made of a bone and a chopping block?"
"228103012-0-71412";"Is there anything more you can tell us?"
"228103012-0-71415";"She's gone? Do you know where she went?"
"228103012-0-71416";"Actually we'd like to know a ship's destination. It's captained by someone named Marso."
"228103012-0-71417";"Elzugoth sent us. She said you'd worked out a trade?"
"228103012-0-71418";"Aurelia's mother asked us to find her. She left a note behind and took off."
"228103012-0-71423";"We're looking for a man named Nilsmon? He might have been drinking here recently."
"228103012-0-71425";"Nari? Titus Stolo sent me to rescue you and deal with some alliance intelligence."
"228103012-0-71429";"Yup, here you go."
"228103012-0-71431";"Tell me more about this curse, Stibbons."
"228103012-0-71432";"We also recovered the medallions that the Ascendant Order stole."
"228103012-0-71442";"Do you think Za'ji's treasure is really here?"
"228103012-0-71446";"Why do we need to get the water flowing?"
"228103012-0-71447";"Why do you think something is wrong?"
"228103012-0-71453";"What will happen now that the curse is lifted?"
"228103012-0-71454";"So now what?"
"228103012-0-71457";"That's our last stop?"
"228103012-0-71460";"You think this thing will work?"
"228103012-0-71464";"Those wounds don't look good."
"228103012-0-71468";"What were you and that Khajiit talking about?"
"228103012-0-71472";"Why didn't you pick up the other scales in here and use those instead?"
"228103012-0-71474";"Your mother was worried. She asked us to look for you."
"228103012-0-71476";"Do you know anything about Sword's Rest Isle?"
"228103012-0-71477";"You heard, then. Aurelia doesn't want to go home yet."
"228103012-0-71480";"What can you tell me about the tabulator and the analysis."
"228103012-0-71482";"Here's the information."
"228103012-0-71483";"Yes, here it is. Lady Arabelle asked me to deliver it to you."
"228103012-0-71488";"How did you and Za'ji get picked to transport Queen Ayrenn to the peace conference?"
"228103012-0-71490";"It's good to see you, too, Caska. Za'ji has been very worried about you."
"228103012-0-71493";"How did you and Za'ji get picked to transport Queen Ayrenn to the peace conference?"
"228103012-0-71497";"What have you been discussing?"
"228103012-0-71499";"Do you want to go to Rivenspire?"
"228103012-0-71502";"Are you all right? Your mother was worried when your letters stopped arriving."
"228103012-0-71505";"Is there anything else you can tell me?"
"228103012-0-71508";"Are you all right, Captain?"
"228103012-0-71510";"Who took her? Which way did they go?"
"228103012-0-71512";"What about you, Isobel?"
"228103012-0-71515";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-71518";"You don't seem much like a knight in training."
"228103012-0-71520";"Yes, I did. I'll give them to you outside where it's much safer."
"228103012-0-71521";"Yes, I did. I'll give them to you outside where it's much safer."
"228103012-0-71523";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-71525";"And who are you?"
"228103012-0-71528";"Can we talk more about Dame Madach? How long have you known her?"
"228103012-0-71531";"Did you know that Dame Madach was dying?"
"228103012-0-71538";"Why are we looking for a hilt? Didn't you say the Iron Knot valued martial skill?"
"228103012-0-71540";"Who are the other aspirants?"
"228103012-0-71549";"You're really the leader of the Aldmeri Dominion?"
"228103012-0-71550";"How fares the alliance?"
"228103012-0-71551";"What are the vulk'esh?"

"228103012-0-71601";"I'm not sure I've heard of a knightly order of mages before."
"228103012-0-71606";"How fares the alliance?"

"228103012-0-71613";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"228103012-0-71615";"Sure thing."
"228103012-0-71620";"If you're asking that does that mean you're not here on … business?"
"228103012-0-71621";"Why would you need to hide from Naryu?"
"228103012-0-71625";"You really think the Ascendant Order wanted us to find and deliver the medallions?"
"228103012-0-71626";"What about the other pirate?"
"228103012-0-71629";"What are you doing in the Bay?"

"228103012-0-71641";"Is Stonelore Grove really that dangerous?"
"228103012-0-71647";"Do you think he will push you harder at your magic studies now?"
"228103012-0-71656";"Will restoring the wards return everything to normal here?"
"228103012-0-71659";"You seem happy."
"228103012-0-71661";"Who exactly are you?"
"228103012-0-71662";"I'll answer your questions about Zenithar."
"228103012-0-71664";"High Isle? Where's that?"
"228103012-0-71665";"Jakarn mentioned you used to be an agent for High King Emeric."
"228103012-0-71666";"Do you plan to continue assisting Lady Arabelle?"

"228103012-0-71706";"What just happened?"
"228103012-0-71715";"After rogue knights darkened the beacon, the keeper spotted three ships before the storm rolled in."
"228103012-0-71719";"Why is the Ascendant Order here?"
"228103012-0-71723";"Not yet. I'd like to learn more about Tales of Tribute."
"228103012-0-71725";"I want to learn more about Taverna."
"228103012-0-71729";"Tell me about Valessea."

"228103012-0-71733";"Can you tell me a little about yourself?"
"228103012-0-71734";"Brahgas seems like quite the gambler."
"228103012-0-71735";"I'm ready to play. Razhamad said you were a good teacher."
"228103012-0-71736";"Rahazmad sent me to you to learn how to play."
"228103012-0-71740";"I have some questions if you don't mind."
"228103012-0-71744";"Yes, I know how to play Tribute."
"228103012-0-71746";"I've played a game with a borrowed deck, now what?"
"228103012-0-71748";"Are druids common on High Isle?"
"228103012-0-71750";"I don't think I've ever met a druid before."

"228103012-0-71759";"Have you tried an offering? Or prayer?"
"228103012-0-71766";"So, what now?"
"228103012-0-71767";"You sure you want to make this journey alone?"
"228103012-0-71770";"Why do I have to go to Gonfalon Bay to play the game?"
"228103012-0-71771";"Someone told me I should talk to you about Tales of Tribute."
"228103012-0-71772";"Bonnie sent me to you to learn about Taverna."

"228103012-0-71787";"Could this be a trap?"
"228103012-0-71788";"Sorinne told me I should ask you about daily challenges."
"228103012-0-71789";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-71791";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-71792";"I'd like to collect my reward."
"228103012-0-71793";"Are you all right now?"

"228103012-0-71814";"Thank you. Just the pass phrase now, right?"
"228103012-0-71824";"Razhamad said you'd fill me in on some details of the club."
"228103012-0-71832";"Why can't you cast your counterspell here?"

"228103012-0-71897";"What more can you tell me about the Sable Knight?"
"228103012-0-71903";"The captains believe the Order's leaders are Breton nobles, and the delegates didn't wash ashore."
"228103012-0-71905";"What's our next move?"
"228103012-0-71906";"Shouldn't we search the seas around High Isle?"
"228103012-0-71912";"Are you going to attack me again?"

"228103012-0-73373";"Druid Laurel isn't a Firesong and we're not here to hurt you. Can you tell us what happened?"
"228103012-0-73374";"We didn't find the wyress, but we found a map that indicates they're interested in Hag Fen."
"228103012-0-73376";"Were you able to recall any of those stories?"
"228103012-0-73378";"So you agree we need to go to Bangkorai and talk to Glenmoril Wyrd?"
"228103012-0-73379";"That was the Firesong Druids. We're not with them. Druid Laurel is a Stonelore Druid."
"228103012-0-73384";"You're the ancient nature spirit, Frii?"
"228103012-0-73386";"Any suggestions on how I should distract the thugs?"
"228103012-0-73387";"Can you tell me anything else about this mission of yours?"
"228103012-0-73389";"How have you been, Raz?"
"228103012-0-73394";"Do you have anything really … memorable? I want to surprise some friends."
"228103012-0-73395";"Can you say more about the research that brought us here?"
"228103012-0-73401";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-73403";"There's something missing?"
"228103012-0-73407";"Where is Devyric taking Druid Laurel?"
"228103012-0-73408";"No one wants to hear you play?"
"228103012-0-73411";"So you can't pay me right now?"
"228103012-0-73415";"The Firesong?"
"228103012-0-73418";"Do you have thoughts on who constructed this place?"
"228103012-0-73420";"What should we do next?"
"228103012-0-73422";"We also stopped whatever the Firesong Druids were doing with those crystals."
"228103012-0-73423";"Why do you think the energy created the storm?"
"228103012-0-73425";"Tell me about these relief efforts."
"228103012-0-73427";"Why are the alliance leaders at Gonfalon Palace?"
"228103012-0-73433";"You think the Ascendant Order still poses a threat to the peace talks?"
"228103012-0-73436";"Lady Arabelle sent me. She'd like to get the peace talks underway."
"228103012-0-73442";"What's the good news?"
"228103012-0-73447";"Why bother with the thugs? Shouldn't we just find the treasure?"
"228103012-0-73448";"You've dealt with Grandvache before?"
"228103012-0-73449";"Can you tell me more about Roneiia?"
"228103012-0-73450";"You said you were hired by House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-73452";"What's wrong with you, Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-73455";"Do you often receive gifts from unidentified admirers?"
"228103012-0-73457";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-73459";"The note doesn't reveal much, but the bottle bears the House Dufort seal. It's a Singular Amber."
"228103012-0-73461";"This bottle of wine. Do you recognize it?"
"228103012-0-73465";"Can you tell me who hired you to make this delivery? Was it Ashcroft's Fine Goods and Imports?"
"228103012-0-73469";"Were you mistaken about the ingredients used to make the poison?"
"228103012-0-73472";"We found recruitment handbills directed at disillusioned druids."
"228103012-0-73475";"Will it take you long to survey the cave?"
"228103012-0-73476";"I found this green crystal in the box."
"228103012-0-73477";"How so?"
"228103012-0-73483";"Do you have any Tribute tips, Raz?"
"228103012-0-73485";"What do the Sea Elves want?"
"228103012-0-73488";"Here are my chips. Let's play."
"228103012-0-73493";"Sir Stefan Mornard sent me. He was concerned that the druids never answered his call."
"228103012-0-73497";"That was the Spirit of Stone?"
"228103012-0-73498";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"228103012-0-73500";"Do you know where we are, Ryvana?"
"228103012-0-73503";"I found a journal written by Lord Bacaro. In it, he admits to being the Ascendant Lord."
"228103012-0-73511";"Lord Bacaro is the Ascendant Lord. He sent the poisoned wine to you and Duchess Elea."
"228103012-0-73515";"What exactly is the Elsweyr Dragon Defense Force?"
"228103012-0-73518";"Sir Stefan sent me. What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-73519";"Captain Samara said I should speak with you for more details about the trials."
"228103012-0-73523";"Tell me more about these Sea Elves."
"228103012-0-73525";"Anything more you need from me here?"
"228103012-0-73530";"Have you heard anything about the druid village at Tuinh?"
"228103012-0-73531";"Sir Stefan said there were Sea Elves near Suncleft Cove."
"228103012-0-73532";"I checked on all the sites Sir Stefan asked me to investigate."
"228103012-0-73533";"Sir Stefan's fine, but Count Mornard was killed, as were Archdruids Rahval and Ellic."
"228103012-0-73536";"What do you mean, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-73543";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-73548";"Let's play."
"228103012-0-73549";"Bacaro already has the gauntlet, but Count Stefan and Druid Laurel have the crown and staff."
"228103012-0-73550";"I need to meet Yves Grandvache."
"228103012-0-73553";"Why can't we just start the peace talks?"
"228103012-0-73554";"What are you?"
"228103012-0-73555";"If Octin broke the tablet, how come you got cursed, too?"
"228103012-0-73556";"What happens if Lord Bacaro gets all three items of the Druid King's regalia?"
"228103012-0-73558";"Do you know which of these is the sacred tree?"
"228103012-0-73559";"I'm <<1>>. Sir Stefan sent me to investigate the cove. Can you tell me what happened here?"
"228103012-0-73560";"I have the sacred sap."
"228103012-0-73562";"How do I retrieve the fire shard?"
"228103012-0-73563";"If you're not with the Dreadsails, who are you?"
"228103012-0-73567";"Roneiia was the Eye of the Queen you mentioned? She didn't die?"
"228103012-0-73568";"That was the Spirit of Stone?"
"228103012-0-73569";"That was the Spirit of Stone?"
"228103012-0-73570";"What's the Deeproot?"
"228103012-0-73574";"Shouldn't we chase after Redblade?"
"228103012-0-73575";"What is the Deeproot?"
"228103012-0-73578";"Why did you decide to take Frii to Galen?"
"228103012-0-73579";"Are you going back to the Mages Guild?"
"228103012-0-73580";"Are you sure you want to go to Galen with Druid Laurel?"
"228103012-0-73581";"The Dreadsails ransacked Tuinh and took captives. But I found them at Suncleft Cove."
"228103012-0-73586";"Why would the Draoife invite you to observe?"
"228103012-0-73587";"Why wouldn't the Eldertide Druids want your help?"
"228103012-0-73588";"Is it safe for you to leave Vastyr right now?"
"228103012-0-73589";"Sir Stefan wants me to join you at the meeting of the Draoife."
"228103012-0-73593";"What's going on, Count Stefan?"
"228103012-0-73594";"What are you thinking, Raz?"
"228103012-0-73598";"What did you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-73599";"Don't tell me you put the crown in the library."
"228103012-0-73601";"We have the fire shard. What's next?"
"228103012-0-73604";"Tell me about the fishing holes and scenic spots you marked on my map."
"228103012-0-73605";"Tell me about these fishing holes and scenic viewpoints."
"228103012-0-73606";"What's it feel like, Joslin?"
"228103012-0-73607";"I'm interested, tell me more."
"228103012-0-73612";"Lord Bacaro is the Ascendant Lord. He believes he's the descendant of the last Druid King."
"228103012-0-73616";"Captain Siravaen is still on the island?"
"228103012-0-73619";"Yes, Druid Fenas says only one of you can be saved. He wants me to choose."
"228103012-0-73620";"Druid Fenas says only one of you can be saved. He wants me to choose."
"228103012-0-73627";"What's it like being a sprite, Octin?"
"228103012-0-73632";"Za'ji and Caska said you might know why Bacaro has come to this location."
"228103012-0-73637";"Tell me everything that happened, Laurel."
"228103012-0-73640";"Any idea why Lord Bacaro would take Frii to Y'ffre's Path?"
"228103012-0-73644";"Why did the wyress send you to find this tablet?"
"228103012-0-73647";"You know Dhulef?"
"228103012-0-73648";"Why is a member of the Mages Guild working with a druid?"
"228103012-0-73654";"I surveyed the locations you gave me"
"228103012-0-73655";"When did you first notice druid camps appearing in the area?"
"228103012-0-73656";"This tablet that Wyress Tola sent Dhulef to examine. Do you know what these symbols mean?"
"228103012-0-73658";"Tell me about yourself. Why did you join the Defense Force?"
"228103012-0-73661";"Tell me a bit about yourself."
"228103012-0-73662";"Druid Laurel is different. The druids you met were of the Firesong Circle."
"228103012-0-73664";"It does seem that the crystal has some connection to the lava flow."
"228103012-0-73668";"What did you step on, Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-73673";"How have you been since Earthen Root Enclave?"
"228103012-0-73675";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"228103012-0-73676";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"228103012-0-73677";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"228103012-0-73686";"You seem confused, Octin."
"228103012-0-73687";"You think Octin's in trouble?"
"228103012-0-73689";"Didn't we deal with the Firesong Druids at Earthen Root Enclave?"
"228103012-0-73691";"What have you been up to since the events in the Graven Deep?"
"228103012-0-73692";"You're a druid?"
"228103012-0-73693";"That was the Spirit of Stone?"
"228103012-0-73694";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-73695";"What was all that about druids?"
"228103012-0-73696";"What was all that about druids?"
"228103012-0-73697";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"228103012-0-73698";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"228103012-0-73699";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"228103012-0-73700";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"228103012-0-73701";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"228103012-0-73702";"What are you doing here, Dhulef?"
"228103012-0-73703";"What can you tell me about Sea Elves?"
"228103012-0-73708";"You didn't trust the druids?"
"228103012-0-73709";"Did you notice anything when Archdruid Michiel took Wyress Tola?"
"228103012-0-73711";"Can you tell me anything else about this nature spirit, wyress?"
"228103012-0-73719";"What is it you do here, Dhulef?"
"228103012-0-73720";"What do you do here, Dhulef?"
"228103012-0-73721";"All right. What do you want me to do?"
"228103012-0-73727";"Tell me more about Galen."
"228103012-0-73728";"Bacaro summoned that spirit to destroy the Stonelore Druids and to deal with us."
"228103012-0-73731";"Count Mornard sent me to ask if you have any idea where the Firesong might be holding Sir Stefan."
"228103012-0-73734";"What training?"
"228103012-0-73737";"I want to hone my skills."
"228103012-0-73740";"Why would the Draoife invite you to observe?"
"228103012-0-73743";"Archdruid Ellic thinks Sir Stefan is at Castle Tonnere. And the Eldertide seed is there, too."
"228103012-0-73744";"What do you think the stone carvings are meant to tell us?"
"228103012-0-73745";"Are you spying on the Dreadsails?"
"228103012-0-73746";"Stefan Mornard wants me to join you at the meeting of the Draoife."
"228103012-0-73750";"Tell me about your vendetta against Sealord Nalos."
"228103012-0-73753";"I tried the Gonfalon seafood gumbo, the ornaug filet, and the fish biscuits."
"228103012-0-73754";"I tried the Gonfalon seafood gumbo, the ornaug filet, and the fish biscuits."
"228103012-0-73755";"I tried the Gonfalon seafood gumbo, the ornaug filet, and the fish biscuits."
"228103012-0-73758";"What do you think the Dream of Kasorayn means?"
"228103012-0-73759";"I'd like to know more about this prophecy."
"228103012-0-73760";"Tell me about the Druid King."
"228103012-0-73761";"Tell me about the Druid King."
"228103012-0-73763";"Tell me more about the sacred seeds."
"228103012-0-73767";"Here's what I found."
"228103012-0-73770";"I will take the test."
"228103012-0-73771";"They're torturing you?"
"228103012-0-73774";"Captain Siravaen is here. She's going after Sealord Nalos while I'm rescuing you."
"228103012-0-73777";"Archdruid Ellic asked me to find you and recover the Eldertide seed."
"228103012-0-73780";"Can you tell us anything else about Sealord Nalos and his plan to attack Vastyr?"
"228103012-0-73784";"Yes. Here's your sacred seed."
"228103012-0-73787";"Umindior? Quen needs your help with the job."
"228103012-0-73790";"Laurel is fine, but Lord Bacaro has all three regalia and Frii. We think they're headed to Y'ffelon."
"228103012-0-73792";"Lord Bacaro has declared himself the new Druid King."
"228103012-0-73797";"Is there any significance to the waterfalls?"
"228103012-0-73800";"So what do you propose, Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-73804";"Archdruid Rahval sent me. Sir Stefan requested that the druids help defend Vastyr and he agreed."
"228103012-0-73805";"Why aren't the spirit motes affecting us in the same way?"
"228103012-0-73806";"The note says two people used an ancient relic."
"228103012-0-73811";"Did you learn anything else while you had Neri's attention?"
"228103012-0-73816";"Can you lead us to the sacred seeds, Frii?"
"228103012-0-73818";"Are you sure Archdruid Orlaith and the sacred seeds are here?"
"228103012-0-73820";"Another song? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-73822";"Told to wait for you? You mean the song that you hear?"
"228103012-0-73824";"This elixir, you know how to make it?"
"228103012-0-73826";"Where am I?"
"228103012-0-73828";"What do you need me to do?"
"228103012-0-73830";"What can I do, my king?"
"228103012-0-73832";"The spirit Elder Aiven summoned? I guess so."
"228103012-0-73834";"We need to find Druid Laurel."
"228103012-0-73836";"Isn't there any way to stop it?"
"228103012-0-73838";"I defeated Lord Bacaro, but Frii took the place of the mountain spirit. They contained the eruption."
"228103012-0-73845";"Are the Eldertide Druids here going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-73847";"Tell me about the relic you found, then I'll help you."
"228103012-0-73851";"Tell me more about this torch and beacon?"
"228103012-0-73852";"What about the sacred seed?"
"228103012-0-73854";"That's why I'm here. Sir Stefan requests that the druids help defend Vastyr from the coming attack."
"228103012-0-73856";"You think the Dreadsails plan to attack Glimmertarn?"
"228103012-0-73858";"Is there anything besides Frii that the Firesong would want in there?"
"228103012-0-73861";"Frii, are you all right? What is this place?"
"228103012-0-73863";"Yes. Here's the sacred seed."
"228103012-0-73869";"No prey."
"228103012-0-73877";"Where did you find the tablet?"
"228103012-0-73878";"Where did you find the tablet?"
"228103012-0-73882";"Two Sea Elves activated the relic. It makes them amorous. Minahel has a plan to dampen its effects."
"228103012-0-73887";"Where did you get food and wine?"
"228103012-0-73892";"Why would the Chronicle feel sad?"
"228103012-0-73893";"No pay."
"228103012-0-73894";"Do you recognize this key, Kiko?"
"228103012-0-73895";"Is the Stonelore seed safe?"
"228103012-0-73897";"Why is Archdruid Orlaith doing all this?"
"228103012-0-73898";"Tell me more about Mount Firesong."
"228103012-0-73899";"Have you seen an Eldertide druid captive here?"
"228103012-0-73900";"Have you seen any other captives here?"
"228103012-0-73903";"Why do you have to stay in Vastyr?"
"228103012-0-73904";"Shouldn't we just keep Frii away from the Firesong Circle?"
"228103012-0-73905";"With Archdruid Rahval dead, who leads the Stonelore Circle?"
"228103012-0-73906";"Should we leave Frii here while we look for the seeds?"
"228103012-0-73907";"What exactly is the Ivy Throne?"
"228103012-0-73908";"What can you tell me about Ivyhame?"
"228103012-0-73909";"Have you always been able to sense the sacred seeds?"
"228103012-0-73910";"Can Archdruid Orlaith force you to regrow the seeds?"
"228103012-0-73913";"Is Vastyr safe now?"
"228103012-0-73914";"What else can we expect to find in here?"
"228103012-0-73917";"You said you have a choice. What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-73918";"Where's the Temple of Y'ffelon?"
"228103012-0-73921";"How will you return your regalia to Y'ffre?"
"228103012-0-73922";"Who's Elder Verline?"
"228103012-0-73923";"The Firesong captured Druid Laurel. They took her to Y'ffelon."
"228103012-0-73924";"The Druid King said I should help you complete the ritual."
"228103012-0-73925";"How do I summon Urdiir the Guardian?"
"228103012-0-73926";"What of Elder Verline and the servants of the Allwither?"
"228103012-0-73931";"You think you understand the riddle?"
"228103012-0-73935";"Why did your wife transform into a forest wraith?"
"228103012-0-73940";"This ritual says it lasts a lunar cycle."
"228103012-0-73944";"Would the Firesong take Sir Stefan off the island?"
"228103012-0-73945";"Why did you ignore Sir Stefan's warnings about trouble among druid circles?"
"228103012-0-73946";"Why didn't you pay attention to Stefan's concerns about the druids?"
"228103012-0-73947";"You and your wife are Eldertide Druids?"
"228103012-0-73948";"I have some difficult questions to ask you, duchess."
"228103012-0-73955";"Your friend told me you'd like these."
"228103012-0-73958";"You said you're training as a sea witch. What magic can you do?"
"228103012-0-73961";"The note and the wine are the same. Do you have any idea where the gift came from?"
"228103012-0-73966";"Why would someone try to kill you and also try to make it look like you killed Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-73968";"What's silverbloom and where do I find it?"
"228103012-0-73972";"Any idea where to look for this cloth?"
"228103012-0-73975";"I've killed a Dragon before."
"228103012-0-73978";"I have it right here. And I brought the magic cloth to cover the relic."
"228103012-0-73981";"Do you recognize it?"
"228103012-0-73984";"A song only you can hear told you how to open the sealed door?"
"228103012-0-73987";"Why do you think a druid is behind this? The courier described a knight under a hooded cloak."
"228103012-0-73989";"I found crates and this shipping label addressed to you in an Ascendant Order stronghold."
"228103012-0-74102";"Are you handling contracts for House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-74103";"You said you work for House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-74107";"What can you tell me about the work?"
"228103012-0-74108";"What's an Imperial consul doing in the Reach?"

"228103012-0-74136";"What are forest wraiths?"
"228103012-0-74137";"I saw a Firesong druid kill one of the Eldertide and threaten your wife."
"228103012-0-74138";"So there's no chance of restoring Octin?"
"228103012-0-74139";"Do you think you can help him restore Joslin to her original form?"
"228103012-0-74140";"Why do you think Gwenaelle's still alive?"
"228103012-0-74141";"How will we tell which forest wraith is actually Gwenaelle?"

"228103012-0-74145";"What will become of Y'ffre's Path without the Chronicle?"
"228103012-0-74146";"What was it like, becoming a forest wraith?"
"228103012-0-74156";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-74160";"Why did Dhulef go off on his own?"

"228103012-0-74178";"Remind me: What happened in the Cathedral District?"
"228103012-0-74179";"Shouldn't we just keep Frii away from the Firesong Circle?"
"228103012-0-74180";"The Firesong attacked. Archdruid Orlaith killed Rahval and Ellic, and took their seeds."
"228103012-0-74181";"The Firesong attacked. Archdruid Orlaith killed Rahval and Ellic, and took their seeds."

"228103012-0-74191";"Can you lead us to the seeds, Frii?"
"228103012-0-74195";"What did you and Frii learn?"
"228103012-0-74196";"Why do you care about protecting these Fauns?"
"228103012-0-74197";"The Firesong have the seeds, should we try and get them?"

"228103012-0-74222";"What is this room?"
"228103012-0-74223";"I'm going to Fauns' Thicket. Are the fuzzy little animals dangerous?"
"228103012-0-74227";"Lady Arabelle would like you to represent Galen at the peace talks."
"228103012-0-74230";"Will you and your partner be safe when we free you?"
"228103012-0-74233";"Druid Laurel is different. The druids you met were of the Firesong Circle."
"228103012-0-74236";"Maybe he was really affected by that activated relic after all?"
"228103012-0-74238";"Lady Arabelle wants you to represent the druids of Galen at the peace talks."
"228103012-0-74239";"I saw your notice. What are you doing here?"

"228103012-0-74255";"What if Frii refuses to go along with this plan?"
"228103012-0-74256";"How do we get to your ship, captain?"
"228103012-0-74257";"Frii wants to help Druid Laurel. They're with Dhulef now."
"228103012-0-74258";"You don't need me to do anything else?"
"228103012-0-74259";"How do you want to proceed, Sir Stefan?"
"228103012-0-74260";"I freed the captives, including Dhulef. He told me Archdruid Orlaith brought Frii and Laurel here."

"228103012-0-74275";"I'm surprised they left any Dreadsails behind. I assumed they'd all be part of the armada."
"228103012-0-74276";"How did they capture your ship?"
"228103012-0-74279";"The harbor chain has been released. Can you get us to Vastyr in time to help?"

"228103012-0-74289";"Did you have any trouble getting the leaders here?"
"228103012-0-74291";"Why send people to the cathedral? Wouldn't Castle Mornard be more defensible?"
"228103012-0-74295";"How long can Vastyr withstand this kind of assault?"
"228103012-0-74296";"Should we go after Druid Laurel?"

"228103012-0-74316";"What do you think of Sir Stefan's plan?"
"228103012-0-74317";"How did the Firesong find us, anyway?"
"228103012-0-74318";"What do you know about the Temple of Y'ffelon?"

"228103012-0-74429";"Have you been hiding Frii?"
"228103012-0-74431";"I don't understand. What could trouble a nature spirit?"

"228103012-0-74863";"Is there anything we can do for Frii?"
"228103012-0-74864";"Is it really that bad being the count, Stefan?"
"228103012-0-74865";"How are you and Count Stefan getting along, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-74866";"Are you interested in becoming an elder or an archdruid, Ryvana?"

"228103012-0-75139";"What kind of magic are you testing?"
"228103012-0-75149";"What do you think Frii knew?"
"228103012-0-75154";"You're relieved I took the job?"
"228103012-0-75158";"How does this job compare to Llanshara?"
"228103012-0-75161";"What are you going to be doing in the meantime, Dhulef?"
"228103012-0-75162";"You're important to me, Quen."
"228103012-0-75169";"What else do you think the Firesong Circle could do?"
"228103012-0-75170";"Before I forget, Foucault Pierrane demanded a private dinner in exchange for the brandy."
"228103012-0-75172";"What do you remember of Druid King Kasorayn?"
"228103012-0-75175";"How are you going to learn more about the Dusksabers and their clients?"
"228103012-0-75176";"You aren't a follower of Hermaeus Mora?"
"228103012-0-75177";"I think Dralys suspects a traitor as well. He warned me to be cautious of you."
"228103012-0-75179";"The Chronicle told me to pour Y'ffre's rain on its roots and the spirit orb."
"228103012-0-75181";"Gwenaelle is safe now."
"228103012-0-75183";"What happened to you at Ivyhame?"
"228103012-0-75184";"Shouldn't we wait to see what the Draoife decides?"
"228103012-0-75185";"Do you think the druids of Galen are ready to follow a Mornard?"
"228103012-0-75186";"Yes, Frii is very confident. Do you think we'll encounter any trouble on our way there?"
"228103012-0-75187";"Why was Ignace here with the druids?"
"228103012-0-75195";"Is there anything we can do for Frii?"
"228103012-0-75197";"Tell me more about the peace talks."
"228103012-0-75203";"How are things going at Y'ffre's Path?"
"228103012-0-75204";"Who's looking after Y'ffre's Path in your absence?"
"228103012-0-75205";"Who's looking after Y'ffre's Path in your absence?"
"228103012-0-75206";"Any progress undoing the curse on Joslin?"
"228103012-0-75207";"Have you found a way to restore Octin yet?"
"228103012-0-75208";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-75209";"Has anyone else come through your camp recently?"
"228103012-0-75211";"Why do you want me to investigate the caravan and the shrine?"
"228103012-0-75213";"I'm here because Rilasi hired me to help her stop the relic from being stolen."
"228103012-0-75215";"I didn't expect to see you out here, Ashur."
"228103012-0-75216";"What happened?"
"228103012-0-75217";"Tell me more about the details of the audit."
"228103012-0-75221";"Did you mention a Kwama queen?"
"228103012-0-75225";"Who exactly are you?"
"228103012-0-75227";"Who are the Remnants?"
"228103012-0-75228";"I'd like to know about the Apogee of the Tormenting Eye."
"228103012-0-75229";"We have similar powers. Where did you learn yours?"
"228103012-0-75230";"You dealt with the Painted Eye already?"
"228103012-0-75234";"Deception? Danger? What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-75237";"Why would you do that?"
"228103012-0-75239";"Shadeya did this. She left a ransom note."
"228103012-0-75242";"I'll just give these to you."
"228103012-0-75245";"This is about that threat you foresaw? Something about the unraveling of reality?"
"228103012-0-75250";"Hermaeus Mora said you would guide me."
"228103012-0-75254";"Who exactly are we up against?"
"228103012-0-75255";"Tell me about Hermaeus Mora."
"228103012-0-75256";"Who are you again?"
"228103012-0-75257";"Tell me more about Apocrypha and its connection to Nirn."
"228103012-0-75258";"What do you know about the enemy that threatens Apocrypha?"
"228103012-0-75259";"How do I know I can trust you?"
"228103012-0-75260";"Tell me more about the locations I need to visit."
"228103012-0-75264";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-75265";"What if Rilasi tells the high priest about you working for the Baandari?"
"228103012-0-75268";"Passengers from the Stormwing may have brought a plague to Necrom."
"228103012-0-75269";"You don't want to be remembered as the port master who let a plague overrun Necrom, do you?"
"228103012-0-75271";"Different how?"
"228103012-0-75272";"So what will you do now, Rilasi?"
"228103012-0-75273";"The Lark of Rosgard is gone. I have the Talisman of Saint Vorys."
"228103012-0-75277";"I found Port Agent Randas where you said, but he was really sick."
"228103012-0-75278";"I'm accompanying Cindieth, an auditor sent by the Consortium. Who are you?"
"228103012-0-75280";"What are you going to do in Necrom?"
"228103012-0-75281";"Who's Valinna?"
"228103012-0-75284";"Who are the Scribes of Mora?"
"228103012-0-75289";"Tell me about the Remnants."
"228103012-0-75290";"How do we learn that?"
"228103012-0-75291";"What do you make of what we found?"
"228103012-0-75292";"Tell me more about yourself."
"228103012-0-75296";"Can we follow her into the Crux?"
"228103012-0-75299";"Zenkif sent me to help defend the Cenotaph."
"228103012-0-75300";"What was the shrine for?"
"228103012-0-75301";"I saw other grotesque creatures inside."
"228103012-0-75302";"Prelate Faram is an imposter. He's the leader of the Hidden Kindred cult and a follower of Peryite."
"228103012-0-75304";"So, you really intend to leave? Cindieth believes without your help, this mine will fail."
"228103012-0-75308";"Why's the book of the pact empty?"
"228103012-0-75311";"What's next for High Isle and the archipelago, Duchess Elea?"
"228103012-0-75313";"Tell me more about Luaffyn Romavel."
"228103012-0-75318";"So what does the future hold for you now?"
"228103012-0-75319";"Who are the Scribes of Mora?"
"228103012-0-75320";"Who are the Scribes of Mora?"
"228103012-0-75321";"There's a rift to the Deadlands in Scrivener's Hall?"
"228103012-0-75323";"There's a rift to the Deadlands in Scrivener's Hall?"
"228103012-0-75324";"There's a rift to the Deadlands in Scrivener's Hall?"
"228103012-0-75325";"There's a rift to the Deadlands in Scrivener's Hall?"
"228103012-0-75326";"Do you think Cindieth will be able to keep her promise to help you?"
"228103012-0-75327";"So what does the future hold for you now?"
"228103012-0-75329";"Do you think you'll be able to convince the Consortium to help the survivors?"
"228103012-0-75333";"Are there any other survivors?"
"228103012-0-75339";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-75345";"I saw Naryu on the Telvanni Peninsula."
"228103012-0-75346";"I haven't seen Naryu since Balmora."
"228103012-0-75350";"Who is this thief, and why is he so interested in this relic?"
"228103012-0-75355";"Did you deliver the druid relic?"
"228103012-0-75356";"What's next for you?"
"228103012-0-75357";"Where are you headed after this?"
"228103012-0-75359";"What's next for High Isle and the archipelago, Duchess Elea?"
"228103012-0-75360";"It's part of a plot to attack Hermaeus Mora. I was told that fate sent me here to stop it."
"228103012-0-75362";"Why are there portals to Apocrypha in an abandoned book bindery, Leramil?"
"228103012-0-75365";"What are you doing in Apocrypha, Ysgild?"
"228103012-0-75368";"What can you tell me about the Disquiet Study?"
"228103012-0-75369";"How did Vorm get turned into a floating book?"
"228103012-0-75372";"So you're going to stop studying druid history, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-75373";"So you're going to stop studying druid history, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-75374";"So you're going to stop studying druid history, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-75375";"So you're going to stop studying druid history, Laurel?"
"228103012-0-75376";"What do you want to talk about, Count Stefan?"
"228103012-0-75378";"What do you want to talk about, Count Stefan?"
"228103012-0-75379";"Yes, I can see you. What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-75382";"You'd really set aside the leadership of House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-75383";"The prelate is actually a Peryite priest named Blightcrown. They got away with part of the relic."
"228103012-0-75385";"Have you determined what the Hidden Kindred plan to do with the relic and the rite?"
"228103012-0-75386";"Do you have plans for yourself?"
"228103012-0-75391";"Tell me more about the Necropolis."
"228103012-0-75392";"You'd really set aside the leadership of House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-75393";"You'd really set aside the leadership of House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-75394";"You'd really set aside the leadership of House Mornard?"
"228103012-0-75395";"What's next for Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-75396";"What's next for Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-75397";"What's next for Lady Arabelle?"
"228103012-0-75398";"Wait, that floating book is your brother?"
"228103012-0-75401";"Will the trap try to stop me?"
"228103012-0-75402";"What do you think Vorm meant by 'family favorites?'"
"228103012-0-75406";"What can you tell me about your family's favorite books?"
"228103012-0-75410";"I'm <<1>>. We heard the place was abandoned."
"228103012-0-75414";"Master Shelreni seems very intent on acquiring that book she mentioned."
"228103012-0-75416";"How are you handling this?"
"228103012-0-75417";"What's the last thing you remember on the ship?"
"228103012-0-75419";"So you really don't remember what happened to you?"
"228103012-0-75422";"You think this mystery cipher was lying?"
"228103012-0-75423";"Do you remember a strange, new cipher?"
"228103012-0-75424";"One of the books spoke of the Chorus as a ""shared vision."""
"228103012-0-75425";"That's the second time you've mentioned a Chorus. What is that?"
"228103012-0-75426";"You said it's dangerous. What will we face in the Rectory?"
"228103012-0-75427";"Master Shelreni sent us to help open a path into the tower. Tell me what happened here."
"228103012-0-75432";"Same, but I saved these pages concerning the relic, lost memories, and the Infinite Panopticon."
"228103012-0-75436";"A gift?"
"228103012-0-75438";"What is the Esoterica Corporea?"
"228103012-0-75439";"How long do minds stay in the Chorus?"
"228103012-0-75440";"So you located the hidden entrance to the Infinite Panopticon?"
"228103012-0-75443";"Tell me about your father."
"228103012-0-75444";"You don't remember why you took these books?"
"228103012-0-75445";"A rogue mind?"
"228103012-0-75446";"What can I expect to find in there?"
"228103012-0-75447";"Have you encountered a rogue mind before?"
"228103012-0-75451";"So, how do we follow the mysterious cipher?"
"228103012-0-75452";"You think the Hidden Kindred are already inside?"
"228103012-0-75453";"Master Shelreni murdered you? Why?"
"228103012-0-75458";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-75460";"Remind me. What do we think the enemy is trying to find in the Infinite Panopticon?"
"228103012-0-75463";"I'm looking for Reynila Treviri."
"228103012-0-75465";"I delivered your flowers. What can you tell me about Reynila?"
"228103012-0-75469";"Brelynn Ardas? I have a delivery for you."
"228103012-0-75470";"Deredrien is a fence who moves specialty items. Harn said she and Reynila used to be friends."
"228103012-0-75471";"Can I ask you more about your amnesia?"
"228103012-0-75475";"I have some questions before we find Federo."
"228103012-0-75476";"Sharp didn't know either. We're trying to track down the Reformer. What can you tell us about him?"
"228103012-0-75477";"Do you trust Federo to give us the information we're after?"
"228103012-0-75478";"You said you know what we need to do?"
"228103012-0-75489";"I need to talk to Master Shelreni. Where can I find her?"
"228103012-0-75490";"Tell me about yourself, Vorm."
"228103012-0-75493";"How did you end up becoming a book?"
"228103012-0-75496";"What are you planning to do now?"
"228103012-0-75503";"Do you understand what Blightcrown's corruption is doing?"
"228103012-0-75505";"You mentioned something called the Hush. What is that?"
"228103012-0-75506";"What is a cipher?"
"228103012-0-75507";"Tell me more about Quires Wind."
"228103012-0-75508";"Cipher Sabinius had instructions from someone called the First Servant."
"228103012-0-75509";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-75510";"Are you at peace with remaining this way?"
"228103012-0-75511";"Your father made his decision. You disagree?"
"228103012-0-75526";"I found this missive, do you know anything about it?"
"228103012-0-75527";"Will you return to the Cloisters?"
"228103012-0-75528";"Tell me more about the illness affecting the Keepers of the Dead."
"228103012-0-75529";"What will you do now that you're free from the cycle?"
"228103012-0-75530";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-75531";"Speaking of fate, anything happen here recently that could be connected to Hermaeus Mora?"
"228103012-0-75540";"I've been asked to give this to you."
"228103012-0-75541";"What do I need to do?"
"228103012-0-75544";"Why exactly do you need me to deliver these flowers?"
"228103012-0-75549";"The knowledge you seek can destroy reality."
"228103012-0-75553";"Torvesard said you hoard secrets. That you stole memories from him and Vaermina. From everyone."
"228103012-0-75556";"I thought you said Reynila was the one sending mercenaries after you."
"228103012-0-75558";"Deredrien betrayed Reynila. She sold her out to the Reformer and led mercenaries to the campsite."
"228103012-0-75559";"I'm helping Sharp, but we only just met. He remembers nothing of his life before a few years ago."
"228103012-0-75560";"Sharp and I have some questions for you first."
"228103012-0-75561";"Why did you think that?"
"228103012-0-75577";"Do you know what you'll say?"
"228103012-0-75578";"Do you know what you'll say?"
"228103012-0-75579";"Do you know what you'll say?"
"228103012-0-75580";"Do you know what you'll say?"
"228103012-0-75582";"Why did you hide the Itinerant Staff in the Deadlands?"
"228103012-0-75586";"He went fishing, like you thought. But he fell sick."
"228103012-0-75589";"Do you trust Mazandi?"
"228103012-0-75591";"Cipher Huzmargo sent me to uncover why you're killing these minds."
"228103012-0-75595";"Wards? What wards?"
"228103012-0-75596";"Keshargo seems to trust you, but you worked for Valinna."
"228103012-0-75612";"What can you tell me about Peryite?"
"228103012-0-75613";"You seem very worried about the abbot."
"228103012-0-75616";"So, the Chorus is safe now?"
"228103012-0-75617";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-75619";"Which portal should I use to reach the vault?"
"228103012-0-75622";"Why do you think Leramil may be part of the threat foreseen?"
"228103012-0-75623";"Is there a difference between the Great Eye and the Golden Eye?"
"228103012-0-75624";"So what does the encoded letter contain?"
"228103012-0-75626";"Why do you keep calling me proxy, Leramil?"
"228103012-0-75630";"Are you sure Master Shelreni is our best lead right now?"
"228103012-0-75631";"What happened? Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-75632";"Both light and shadow can be deadly."
"228103012-0-75635";"The only letter I've seen is the one from Dacia saying she didn't love Nathyn. Did you write that?"
"228103012-0-75637";"I found Sathile Dreloth's research notes. I also found a letter. Did you write this?"
"228103012-0-75638";"We still don't understand exactly who or what Delmon is."
"228103012-0-75639";"If Delmon has been dead for so long, how could he be responsible for what happened in the lab?"
"228103012-0-75645";"What do you know about the relic Velis Faram is looking for?"
"228103012-0-75647";"What else can you tell me about Prior Durdryn and his tomb?"
"228103012-0-75648";"Tell me about the catacombs."
"228103012-0-75649";"She hired me to come rescue you."
"228103012-0-75650";"You infected your own son with the Knahaten Flu?"
"228103012-0-75651";"You could consider Sathile's other option. Or, you could just leave."
"228103012-0-75652";"Are Abbot Ilvel and the other keepers going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-75653";"What kind of relics are down in the catacombs?"
"228103012-0-75654";"What's the difference between an assembly and a conclave?"
"228103012-0-75658";"And you can help us avoid detection?"
"228103012-0-75663";"Tell me what happened here."
"228103012-0-75667";"I have some questions before we head to Ald Isra."
"228103012-0-75673";"I have some questions."
"228103012-0-75683";"Can we help you first?"
"228103012-0-75685";"What did you call him when you saw him?"
"228103012-0-75690";"Dimik-ei remembers you. She says she's your sister. Apparently you grew up together."
"228103012-0-75693";"Why did you hide the Itinerant Staff in the Deadlands?"
"228103012-0-75695";"<Lie> Dreynis said you could have the prism."
"228103012-0-75699";"Heard any good gossip recently?"
"228103012-0-75702";"I found this jar in the servants quarters."
"228103012-0-75703";"Who exactly are you?"
"228103012-0-75704";"You mentioned a fated glyphic. What's that?"
"228103012-0-75705";"What can you tell me about Underweave?"
"228103012-0-75706";"You've been keeping your son isolated?"
"228103012-0-75708";"What do you make of the two letters we found here?"
"228103012-0-75709";"What do you think about the choice?"
"228103012-0-75718";"Here. I found more of Dreynis's research."

"228103012-0-76027";"It gives the location of the Reformer's new hideout. And it sounds like he still has Dimik-ei."
"228103012-0-76028";"How do the Mnemonic Fragments work?"
"228103012-0-76030";"A tracking spell? Like the one you used to find the Reformer's other hideout?"

"228103012-0-76080";"Wait a moment. You said something about the particulars?"
"228103012-0-76087";"Check your list. I hereby invoke the twenty-sixth statute of the Necrom Agreement and demand entry."
"228103012-0-76089";"Shelreni's here? I saw her mouth outside. He said the masters are in danger. Let's go get Shelreni!"

"228103012-0-76131";"What are you going to do while I go to the camp?"
"228103012-0-76132";"And what happens if we run into Sathile?"
"228103012-0-76136";"Deception? Danger? What's going on here?"
"228103012-0-76141";"These pages talk about Master Shelreni's arrangement with Torvesard."

"228103012-0-78403";"They're instructions for Endegor, from Torvesard."
"228103012-0-78409";"What can you tell me about Stri the Fate-Eater?"
"228103012-0-78411";"What can you tell me about tharrikers?"
"228103012-0-78413";"What else can you tell me about Hessedaz the Baleful?"
"228103012-0-78415";"What can you tell me about the Recollection leaders?"
"228103012-0-78417";"What are we trying to learn in here?"
"228103012-0-78418";"What can you tell me about Oakenclaw?"
"228103012-0-78448";"Can you tell me anything else about the Recollection?"
"228103012-0-78450";"Tell us what you're trying to do, Torvesard. Make us understand."
"228103012-0-78456";"We investigated all three disturbances. What now?"
"228103012-0-78458";"Torvesard plans to use relics of Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala to locate Prince Ithelia."
"228103012-0-78475";"Tell me more about Verses."
"228103012-0-78485";"Hermaeus Mora speaks to you?"
"228103012-0-78486";"Wait, verses?"
"228103012-0-78491";"What about the relics? How do they fit in?"
"228103012-0-78496";"Very well. This is the Echonir."
"228103012-0-78559";"Why do you call me proxy?"
"228103012-0-78560";"Were you close to Lady Weatherleah?"
"228103012-0-78561";"Is Black-Glove Garm always this obstinate?"
"228103012-0-78565";"Will you remind me of who is involved?"
"228103012-0-78568";"Yes. How do I use it?"
"228103012-0-78573";"Why do you think these deserters took control of Fort Colovia?"
"228103012-0-78578";"What will your parents think of all this?"
"228103012-0-78585";"I'm not sure when the auction will begin."
"228103012-0-78586";"How can we get to a sunken shrine?"
"228103012-0-78587";"I'm as surprised as you are, Torvesard."
"228103012-0-78591";"Hermaeus Mora told me to seek your counsel."
"228103012-0-78593";"I'm here with Master Bogvir."
"228103012-0-78595";"Why is it disturbing?"
"228103012-0-78596";"I'm here with Master Bogvir."
"228103012-0-78597";"It sounds like the Recollection want the Oathsworn to join them."
"228103012-0-78600";"What can you tell me about the Lodge of the Axe?"
"228103012-0-78601";"Actually, I was hoping to talk to you."
"228103012-0-78602";"What does that mean, the Last Tomorrow?"
"228103012-0-78603";"You think this is your fault?"
"228103012-0-78604";"Yes, I dealt with the rituals."
"228103012-0-78608";"You're asking a lot of questions about necromancy."
"228103012-0-78609";"Why are you so suspicious of Uriel?"
"228103012-0-78612";"I am curious."
"228103012-0-78615";"Do you share Aquilia's doubts about your mother's death?"
"228103012-0-78618";"Were you present the day Lady Weatherleah died?"
"228103012-0-78621";"Betu listens to your commands?"
"228103012-0-78623";"Did you find Lady Weatherleah's body?"
"228103012-0-78626";"Did you see anyone else?"
"228103012-0-78629";"We must be missing something."
"228103012-0-78632";"What sorts of disturbances and disorder?"
"228103012-0-78635";"I've already been to a place you mentioned."
"228103012-0-78636";"Why do they call you Leramil the Wise?"
"228103012-0-78643";"Isn't this the wine that the guests have come to bid on at the auction?"
"228103012-0-78653";"Did you say there are bears in the passage?"
"228103012-0-78654";"Here's the payroll. Calvo stayed behind to repeat the chime sequence at the required intervals."
"228103012-0-78658";"Lord Valente's wife is Ursilia Valente. She seems to know you and wants to talk to you."
"228103012-0-78663";"Lord Valente's journal explains everything. Here, take a look."
"228103012-0-78665";"Here is the confession letter."
"228103012-0-78668";"Actually, we wanted to know if you were close to the cook, Edric Brussiner?"
"228103012-0-78673";"We found the cook dead in the garden with a note confessing to poisoning Lady Weatherleah."
"228103012-0-78676";"Actually, we were wondering if you served Lady Weatherleah tea the morning she died?"
"228103012-0-78679";"An aura of Daedric power?"
"228103012-0-78681";"Tell me more about the Echonir."
"228103012-0-78682";"What else should I know about Elenglynn?"
"228103012-0-78683";"Pelena poisoned Lady Weatherleah."
"228103012-0-78686";"This is Elenglynn. We believe it's the shrine of a Daedric Prince."
"228103012-0-78689";"We know you had Uriel killed."
"228103012-0-78691";"What ingredients do you need?"
"228103012-0-78693";"What happens now?"
"228103012-0-78696";"Yes, I found the ingredients you requested."
"228103012-0-78697";"Yes. Pelena Weatherleah was our killer."
"228103012-0-78700";"We are. How did you wind up in that cage?"
"228103012-0-78705";"Since prison is a temporary solution at best, why don't you send Ithelia down a different path?"
"228103012-0-78707";"Mortals change all the time. And we saw different versions of you on the Many Paths."
"228103012-0-78715";"Are you sure you want to stay here, Calvo?"
"228103012-0-78716";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-78717";"Remind me about Leramil the Wise."
"228103012-0-78718";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-78719";"Why are the Blind Path invading?"
"228103012-0-78720";"Yes. I defeated the Blind Path cultists in Bedlam Veil."
"228103012-0-78728";"Why was Haldain logging in that forest?"
"228103012-0-78729";"Why was Halidain logging in that forest?"
"228103012-0-78732";"What did you make of the memory the Echonir revealed to us?"
"228103012-0-78734";"Tribune Alea and I kept Recollection and Daedric forces from invading Skingrad at Rustwall Estate."
"228103012-0-78737";"Grimmer sent me."
"228103012-0-78738";"How could everyone forget a Daedric Prince?"
"228103012-0-78739";"I'm not sure why a Daedric Prince needs my help."
"228103012-0-78740";"Tell me about Torvesard."
"228103012-0-78743";"A new design? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-78753";"If King Nantharion used the staff at these locations, there's no guarantee he's still there now."
"228103012-0-78754";"I did have help, you know."
"228103012-0-78755";"So that's it? Three relics, a spell, and reality is healed?"
"228103012-0-78758";"Shouldn't the Skein of Secrets show us where Ithelia is?"
"228103012-0-78759";"Tell me more about what you think King Nantharion is up to."
"228103012-0-78761";"What last matter is that?"
"228103012-0-78766";"Tell me more about Legionary Calvo."
"228103012-0-78767";"We found this seed in Ostumir. Beragon thinks you might be able to tell us something about it."
"228103012-0-78771";"King Nantharion planted wildburn seeds at Terthil Farm and Hastrel Hollow."
"228103012-0-78774";"We did lose Gadayn. While we were seeking the shattered titan to defeat Ithelia."
"228103012-0-78776";"I'm <<1>>. Beragon thinks the Recollection may be recruiting its members from among your people."
"228103012-0-78781";"It may be lost, but Ithelia seemed to know where to find it."
"228103012-0-78783";"What exactly is the Well of Miscarcand?"
"228103012-0-78786";"Tribune Alea followed Ithelia and King Nantharion into these ruins?"
"228103012-0-78787";"The Recollection? Never heard of them."
"228103012-0-78790";"Could Tham still be alive?"
"228103012-0-78791";"Tell me a little about yourself."
"228103012-0-78792";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-78793";"Those vampires recognized you."
"228103012-0-78796";"King Nantharion said that Count Calantius has refused his offers to work together."
"228103012-0-78799";"You charged down here by yourself? What were you thinking?"
"228103012-0-78801";"Survivors? The note didn't mention any survivors."
"228103012-0-78805";"Pretty well. We recovered the Lamp of Clarity and a blade called Abolisher."
"228103012-0-78808";"What's the problem?"
"228103012-0-78811";"What do you make of our choices?"
"228103012-0-78814";"What's the stone do?"
"228103012-0-78817";"Hermaeus Mora had allies. Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. Together they defeated Ithelia."
"228103012-0-78820";"You explored Niryastare before?"
"228103012-0-78821";"Tell me about Feldagard Keep."
"228103012-0-78822";"What's going on at the Outcast Inn?"
"228103012-0-78823";"Tell me more about the situation at Feldagard Keep."
"228103012-0-78824";"I defeated King Nantharion, but Ithelia regained her power and departed with Shardmarshal Vargas."
"228103012-0-78825";"It's not safe. Vampires still overrun the town. But what do you mean, your husband's last excursion?"
"228103012-0-78828";"What do you think Grivier can tell us?"
"228103012-0-78829";"We saw the Terror's orders. We know you've been leading the townsfolk right to the vampires."
"228103012-0-78832";"What do you think we should do, Maerenah?"
"228103012-0-78833";"Do you know where they are headed?"
"228103012-0-78837";"What's next for Leftwheal Trading Post?"
"228103012-0-78840";"You really think the Recollection has a spy in Vashabar?"
"228103012-0-78847";"How do you know so much about the Oathsworn Pit?"
"228103012-0-78848";"How do you know so much about the Oathsworn Pit?"

"228103012-0-78858";"Tell me about the legionary whose orders I recovered."
"228103012-0-78860";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-78861";"A long journey ahead? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-78862";"Who's Black-Glove Garm?"
"228103012-0-78863";"Who is Black-Glove Garm?"
"228103012-0-78864";"Who is Black-Glove Garm?"

"228103012-0-78866";"What do you know about the Recollection?"
"228103012-0-78867";"Who's Axeborn Khurga?"
"228103012-0-78868";"Who's Axeborn Khurga?"
"228103012-0-78869";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-78870";"Are you going to be all right?"
"228103012-0-78873";"What can you tell me about the Lodge of the Axe?"
"228103012-0-78874";"What can you tell me about the Lodge of the Axe?"
"228103012-0-78875";"What sorts of sacred items was the ship carrying?"
"228103012-0-78876";"Did Scruut say why she thinks a forge will restore Abolisher?"
"228103012-0-78877";"What do you know about this shrine of Azura?"
"228103012-0-78878";"What can you tell me about the last time you were here?"
"228103012-0-78880";"How did you learn about Ayleid puzzles?"
"228103012-0-78881";"This is the Echonir, a relic that reveals memories. And that was the Daedric Prince, Ithelia."
"228103012-0-78885";"What's the Staff of Many Paths?"
"228103012-0-78886";"How will I recognize Dulzush Forgefire?"
"228103012-0-78888";"Any idea where Ithelia and Torvesard are or what they're up to?"
"228103012-0-78889";"Do you have a way to get back to Nirn, Gadayn?"
"228103012-0-78891";"How will Torvesard free Ithelia with the Blade of Unraveling?"
"228103012-0-78892";"What do you mean, one way or another?"
"228103012-0-78895";"Who has the answers you're looking for?"
"228103012-0-78896";"Why does the Staff of Many Paths matter?"
"228103012-0-78898";"What should I know about the Terror of the Weald and his gang of vampires?"
"228103012-0-78900";"What can you tell me about the town of Sutch?"
"228103012-0-78911";"Sounds like you and Balandrus had a falling out."
"228103012-0-78914";"You have explosives in your alchemy shop?"
"228103012-0-78916";"Both the orders and Rosalyn mentioned something about an army."
"228103012-0-78922";"What is the Staff of Many Paths?"
"228103012-0-78923";"What did the Recollection want?"
"228103012-0-78924";"What did the Recollection want?"
"228103012-0-78925";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-78926";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-78927";"What are you going to do now?"
"228103012-0-78928";"King Nantharion and Shardmarshal Vargas escaped."
"228103012-0-78933";"The letter suggests the servants are hiding in the catacombs."
"228103012-0-78934";"Tracking down Ithelia was what brought me here. Maybe the answer is connected to her in some way."
"228103012-0-78938";"Why did the Recollection attack?"
"228103012-0-78941";"Captain Leronus is dead. Me and Tribune Alea are the only reinforcements."
"228103012-0-78946";"What now?"
"228103012-0-78952";"Ithelia said she was leaving our world. Why are the Shardborn still attacking?"
"228103012-0-78955";"What are you going to do while we wait for a sign, Leramil?"
"228103012-0-78965";"Decided you needed to fight more Daedra, Tribune Alea?"
"228103012-0-78973";"Why does everyone keep saying Daedra can't change? Didn't we see Ithelia change?"
"228103012-0-78974";"I thought Beragon and Tribune Alea were right behind us."
"228103012-0-78978";"So even before she remembered why, Shardmarshal Vargas was drawn to this place?"
"228103012-0-78981";"Shardmarshal Vargas said she banished Beragon and Tribune Alea to the Many Paths."
"228103012-0-78985";"How can we stop the ritual?"
"228103012-0-78988";"Tell me about these sites you want me to investigate."
"228103012-0-78989";"Just someone who happened by and decided to help him rescue survivors. Why did you invite him here?"
"228103012-0-78992";"Tell me about these sites you want me to visit."
"228103012-0-78993";"Tell me about these sites you want me to visit."
"228103012-0-78994";"Tell me about these sites you want me to visit."
"228103012-0-78995";"Tell me about these sites you want me to visit."
"228103012-0-78999";"I'm not sure I understand how Ithelia escaped."
"228103012-0-79000";"How did Ithelia escape?"
"228103012-0-79001";"Why do we need to stop the ritual?"
"228103012-0-79002";"I'm a necromancer, you know."
"228103012-0-79005";"I recovered a fragment of the Primordial Shattered Titan."
"228103012-0-79007";"How exactly do I use the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79008";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-79011";"Something blocked me from using the Skein of Secrets?"
"228103012-0-79017";"Tell me more about what happened here."
"228103012-0-79018";"The Recollection doesn't like you very much."
"228103012-0-79019";"Tell me more about these five loyal retainers."
"228103012-0-79020";"How long have you and Elfbetta been together?"
"228103012-0-79021";"Have you seen something like this before?"
"228103012-0-79022";"Do their reports mention anything else?"
"228103012-0-79023";"What do you make of this?"
"228103012-0-79024";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-79025";"Narsis Dren is an … interesting … person to work with."
"228103012-0-79037";"A mirror world? Can you describe it?"
"228103012-0-79041";"Is that a problem? Most people can't see fate."
"228103012-0-79050";"I'd like to hear more about your creature show."
"228103012-0-79051";"What did you bring us down here to show us, greenspeaker?"
"228103012-0-79053";"Is there anything else we need to do?"
"228103012-0-79066";"This house is enormous. It's all yours?"
"228103012-0-79067";"Why do you live in Skingrad?"
"228103012-0-79068";"You said no Bosmer who honors the Green would deal with a wildburn seed. What about Sorilen?"
"228103012-0-79073";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"228103012-0-79074";"What do you do for Fa-Nuit-Hen?"
"228103012-0-79076";"What's the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79077";"Do you know anything about the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79078";"The Blind mentioned needing the Echonir for her Prince. Do you know who that is?"
"228103012-0-79079";"How will things be interesting?"
"228103012-0-79081";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-79083";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-79086";"What will you do now?"
"228103012-0-79090";"What do we know so far?"
"228103012-0-79095";"Tell me more about <<1>>'s death."
"228103012-0-79098";"I'm listening. Go ahead."
"228103012-0-79124";"Who is she?"
"228103012-0-79127";"Did you try asking her to leave?"
"228103012-0-79128";"Narsis is…otherwise indisposed. He sent me ahead to deliver the Emblem."
"228103012-0-79131";"This performance in Fargrave seems important to you."
"228103012-0-79133";"So you have control of your portal magic again?"
"228103012-0-79135";"Tribune Alea thinks some of your people might be part of the Recollection."
"228103012-0-79137";"How did you grow this forest so quickly?"
"228103012-0-79138";"What can you tell me about the Dawnwood?"
"228103012-0-79139";"Are you really a king?"
"228103012-0-79140";"How did you become King of the Dawnwood?"
"228103012-0-79155";"I understand that some Wood Elves here don't follow the Green Pact."
"228103012-0-79156";"She mentioned a drink called Sage's Dream. She wants you to make it for her."
"228103012-0-79157";"Any idea why this drink is so important to her?"
"228103012-0-79160";"Yes, I did. It describes a drink made by Ayleids called the Sage's Dream."
"228103012-0-79164";"Can you tell me who you are and what you're doing here?"
"228103012-0-79165";"Tell me what you do remember."
"228103012-0-79168";"Why do you hate this lamp?"
"228103012-0-79172";"The other Ithelia can't control her power. She's a threat to my reality. This lamp led us here."
"228103012-0-79173";"Can I ask you about the Many Paths?"
"228103012-0-79176";"What about the echoes and other strange things around the inn?"
"228103012-0-79181";"Do you know where the Shrine of Inevitable Secrets is located?"
"228103012-0-79182";"I'm looking for the Shrine of Inevitable Secrets."
"228103012-0-79192";"All of this is your realm?"
"228103012-0-79193";"What do you know about the Blind Path?"
"228103012-0-79196";"What will you do with the captured Recollection soldier?"
"228103012-0-79197";"What's the purpose of the signal fires again?"
"228103012-0-79198";"What makes you say that?"
"228103012-0-79201";"We spoke at Elenglynn. What brought you here?"
"228103012-0-79204";"What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-79211";"I'm helping Constable Yabren with an investigation. Can I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-79216";"I'm not really sure."
"228103012-0-79226";"I sense something familiar about you."
"228103012-0-79232";"I'm not here for a job. I'm assisting Constable Yabren with an investigation."
"228103012-0-79238";"I'm not here to buy food. I'm assisting Constable Yabren with an investigation."
"228103012-0-79245";"What's the message?"
"228103012-0-79250";"Are they really that bad?"
"228103012-0-79253";"How will following the maligraphies uncover Tho'at Replicanum's nymic?"
"228103012-0-79260";"He was poisoned. We found the same residue in Lady Weatherleah's teacup."
"228103012-0-79262";"So that's it? We defeated Tho'at Replicanum?"
"228103012-0-79264";"So that's it? We defeated Tho'at Replicanum?"
"228103012-0-79265";"Do you know where they took Constable Yabren?"
"228103012-0-79279";"Good to see you again, Narsis. I heard you could use some help."
"228103012-0-79280";"Elfbetta sent me. How can I help?"
"228103012-0-79285";"At least they didn't stick you in a bottle this time."
"228103012-0-79286";"You know something about the Lamp of Clarity and Abolisher?"
"228103012-0-79287";"You're not coming to Niryastare?"
"228103012-0-79290";"It's a note from Edric. He discovered Pelena's involvement with Uriel's murder."
"228103012-0-79299";"You're a werewolf?"
"228103012-0-79305";"You're willing to work with the Wood Elves now?"
"228103012-0-79308";"Yes. I defeated the mercenaries. They didn't have a chance to dump the barrels of elixir."
"228103012-0-79313";"What should I ask these townsfolk about?"
"228103012-0-79314";"What will these items do?"
"228103012-0-79318";"Remind me. What's happening in West Weald?"
"228103012-0-79319";"Remind me. How did we get here?"
"228103012-0-79327";"I'm curious about your whistle and compass."
"228103012-0-79342";"What can you tell me about the Skyvault?"
"228103012-0-79343";"Do you know what The Blind is after?"
"228103012-0-79347";"Where did Torvesard go?"
"228103012-0-79348";"Any idea how we get inside?"
"228103012-0-79349";"Tell me about Commander Merian."
"228103012-0-79352";"What's this part of the keep used for?"
"228103012-0-79356";"What do you have in mind?"
"228103012-0-79357";"Tell me about the attackers."
"228103012-0-79360";"The Daedra were using portals under the keep to bring in reinforcements. That path has been closed."
"228103012-0-79364";"Any thoughts on how to do that?"
"228103012-0-79365";"Any idea what Mirrormoor is?"
"228103012-0-79369";"Tell me about this feeling."
"228103012-0-79372";"You fought in Cyrodiil?"
"228103012-0-79387";"What's the Hall of Barons?"
"228103012-0-79388";"Who is the Mad Architect?"
"228103012-0-79389";"What did the Echonir show you?"
"228103012-0-79390";"What happened here?"
"228103012-0-79393";"Is King Nantharion here?"
"228103012-0-79395";"You look injured."
"228103012-0-79410";"Your debut?"
"228103012-0-79414";"How can I help?"
"228103012-0-79415";"Vargas closed the portals leading farther into the ruins."
"228103012-0-79418";"What are these Aetherial shards used for?"
"228103012-0-79423";"What are Lady Sowerra's options?"
"228103012-0-79428";"What do you think the Blind is after?"
"228103012-0-79431";"What are your options?"
"228103012-0-79436";"What are Sir Klauser's options?"
"228103012-0-79439";"You heard right. Laeni and Clendagal are fed up. They want to leave, start a new life."
"228103012-0-79440";"Before we get down to business, how about we share a mug of jagga. It's Ciiril's best!"
"228103012-0-79441";"Before we get down to business, how about we share a mug of jagga. It's Ciiril's best!"
"228103012-0-79442";"I gave the fathers the jagga and told them about the marriage. They didn't change their minds."
"228103012-0-79443";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave the village."
"228103012-0-79444";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Clendagal and Laeni are going to leave town."
"228103012-0-79445";"Not well. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave the village so they can be wed."
"228103012-0-79446";"Laeni and Clendagal may not have to leave after all. Take a look at this."
"228103012-0-79448";"Actually, I think I have. Take a look at this."
"228103012-0-79449";"You think a seedpod will be a good symbol for the ceremony?"
"228103012-0-79450";"Can you tell me more about the mosaic you want me to recover?"
"228103012-0-79451";"A Rite of Propagation. Laeni and Clendagal are going to ask the village to sanction their marriage."
"228103012-0-79455";"You did a great deal for the couple as well."
"228103012-0-79456";"How will this be good for the village?"
"228103012-0-79457";"The start of a new story?"
"228103012-0-79458";"How do you feel about all of this?"
"228103012-0-79459";"You said your fathers want to grind each other into bonemeal?"
"228103012-0-79462";"This is Leramil the Wise. I'm helping her look for Torvesard."
"228103012-0-79468";"Congratulations on your appointment. You have a new act?"
"228103012-0-79471";"I was sent here by Commandant Salerius to destroy crates of misprinted invitations."
"228103012-0-79475";"Legionary Calvo recognized the leader of the bandits. It was Marius Gallo."
"228103012-0-79481";"What do you know about Miscarcand?"
"228103012-0-79483";"What happens to Vashabar now that King Nantharion is dead?"
"228103012-0-79485";"You think the Recollection is beaten?"
"228103012-0-79488";"You don't think you can take back the fort on your own?"
"228103012-0-79489";"Beragon? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-79490";"Beragon? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-79491";"Tell me a little about yourself."
"228103012-0-79497";"You said someone stole a staff from Oathsworn Pit?"
"228103012-0-79498";"You said someone stole a staff from Oathsworn Pit?"
"228103012-0-79499";"Who are you?"
"228103012-0-79501";"King Bazrag? What are you doing here?"
"228103012-0-79504";"You should know, Amaurel mentioned she had a sister."
"228103012-0-79509";"What exactly happened in Bedlam Veil?"
"228103012-0-79510";"What exactly happened in Bedlam Veil?"
"228103012-0-79511";"I don't think I've met you before."
"228103012-0-79512";"I didn't expect to find you here."
"228103012-0-79513";"I don't think I've met you before."
"228103012-0-79514";"I didn't expect to find you here."
"228103012-0-79516";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-79518";"Good to see you again."
"228103012-0-79519";"Good to see you again."
"228103012-0-79520";"Elfbetta has requested that I accompany you into Wendir."
"228103012-0-79521";"Elfbetta has requested that I accompany you into Wendir."
"228103012-0-79586";"Tell me about Torvesard."
"228103012-0-79587";"Tell me about Torvesard."
"228103012-0-79588";"I'm not sure why a Daedric Prince needs my help."
"228103012-0-79589";"Why do you call me proxy?"
"228103012-0-79590";"Why do you call me proxy?"
"228103012-0-79591";"Why do you call me proxy?"
"228103012-0-79592";"Why do you call me proxy?"
"228103012-0-79596";"Are you all right?"
"228103012-0-79597";"You seem upset."
"228103012-0-79598";"What's the Lodge of the Forge?"
"228103012-0-79599";"Who's Dulzush Forgefire?"
"228103012-0-79603";"What are you doing?"
"228103012-0-79608";"Other than your father, all the recent deaths were laborers. Ranchers and quarry workers both."
"228103012-0-79610";"They confirmed the seriousness of fatigue fever, but they claimed to know nothing about any crimes."
"228103012-0-79613";"Can you tell me my fortune?"
"228103012-0-79614";"Why are you here instead of the Maelstrom Arena?"
"228103012-0-79616";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-79617";"What are you doing out here?"
"228103012-0-79628";"What are you doing in such a dangerous place?"
"228103012-0-79631";"If you're a Tribute player, why are you in such a dangerous place?"
"228103012-0-79647";"What do we need to do?"
"228103012-0-79648";"Will you return to Rivenspire now, Fennorian?"
"228103012-0-79649";"How will Torvesard free Ithelia with the Blade of Unraveling?"
"228103012-0-79650";"Where do we go now?"
"228103012-0-79651";"What are you two doing out here?"
"228103012-0-79652";"What's the Molag Bal Paradox?"
"228103012-0-79653";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-79654";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-79655";"What do we do now?"
"228103012-0-79656";"What do we do now?"

"228103012-0-79664";"What are your thoughts on the paradox?"
"228103012-0-79667";"I have some thoughts."
"228103012-0-79673";"Tell me about this town, Yabren."
"228103012-0-79679";"Tell me more about your father, Yabren."
"228103012-0-79682";"How have you been?"
"228103012-0-79683";"Do you want to talk about the Molag Bal Paradox again?"
"228103012-0-79688";"I have some thoughts."
"228103012-0-79695";"Can you remind me about Curate Gadayn?"
"228103012-0-79696";"Can you remind me about Curate Gadayn?"
"228103012-0-79697";"You've been spending time with Curate Gadayn?"
"228103012-0-79698";"Can you remind me about Curate Gadayn?"
"228103012-0-79701";"Do you remember anything about the invasion?"
"228103012-0-79702";"Can you tell me anything about the invasion?"
"228103012-0-79703";"Do you know how the Recollection invaded?"
"228103012-0-79704";"Do you recall what happened?"
"228103012-0-79710";"Do you know where to find the Shrine of Inevitable Secrets?"
"228103012-0-79723";"I'm here to ask you some questions on behalf of Constable Yabren."
"228103012-0-79725";"I already have a job. I'm working with Constable Yabren. Can I ask you some questions?"
"228103012-0-79735";"Can you move away from it?"
"228103012-0-79736";"Can you move away from it?"
"228103012-0-79737";"Can you move away from it?"
"228103012-0-79741";"I'm helping Constable Yabren with an investigation. Can I ask you a few questions?"
"228103012-0-79744";"I'm here to ask you some questions on behalf of Constable Yabren."
"228103012-0-79745";"Where did Torvesard go?"
"228103012-0-79750";"Where did Torvesard go?"
"228103012-0-79752";"I didn't do all this by myself, you know."
"228103012-0-79753";"Did it work? Did we repair the fabric of reality?"
"228103012-0-79757";"Hermaeus Mora wants me to return to Apocrypha?"
"228103012-0-79758";"I did want to ask what you thought of what happened. How Ithelia agreed to leave this reality."
"228103012-0-79760";"Leramil thinks West Weald might also be Torvesard's next destination."
"228103012-0-79762";"So, what's next for you, Beragon?"
"228103012-0-79763";"I need to tell you, Leramil. Hermaeus Mora made you all forget something significant."
"228103012-0-79764";"That thing you're trying to remember, it's Ithelia the Prince of Paths."
"228103012-0-79765";"You're forgetting the Daedric Prince Ithelia. Don't you remember anything?"
"228103012-0-79766";"It's been an adventure, that's for sure. Do you remember … Ithelia?"
"228103012-0-79767";"You said that if Torvesard succeeded, reality would end. Were you wrong?"
"228103012-0-79773";"You said that if Torvesard succeeded, reality would end. Were you wrong?"
"228103012-0-79774";"You said that if Torvesard succeeded, reality would end. Were you wrong?"
"228103012-0-79775";"Why are you here instead of the Maelstrom Arena?"
"228103012-0-79776";"What do you do for Fa-Nuit-Hen?"
"228103012-0-79777";"Too late? What do you mean?"
"228103012-0-79778";"Are you the leader of Vashabar now?"
"228103012-0-79780";"What else can you tell me about Votary Nahlia?"
"228103012-0-79783";"What does Hermaeus Mora want me to do?"
"228103012-0-79791";"What do you think I should do?"
"228103012-0-79796";"He asked me to help you investigate a magical anomaly."
"228103012-0-79800";"How are you involved with the Legion?"
"228103012-0-79805";"This village is called Vashabar, you said. Can you tell me about it?"
"228103012-0-79806";"Why can't you just ignore what your fathers think and get married?"
"228103012-0-79822";"How exactly do I use the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79823";"What is this place?"
"228103012-0-79824";"We're not here to gloat. I need a Sage's Dream so the Ithelia of my reality can control her power."
"228103012-0-79828";"I need to make a Sage's Dream so my Ithelia can control her power."
"228103012-0-79832";"Anything specific I should know before we face Balandrus?"
"228103012-0-79834";"You're safe and Balandrus is dead. That's all that matters."
"228103012-0-79842";"Who is the Mad Architect?"
"228103012-0-79843";"What is the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79844";"Do you know anything about the Echonir?"
"228103012-0-79848";"How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?"
"228103012-0-79849";"What are we supposed to do if we find Ithelia?"
"228103012-0-79850";"What are we supposed to do if we find Ithelia?"
"228103012-0-79851";"What are we supposed to do if we find Ithelia?"
"228103012-0-79855";"I can try to close those doors."
"228103012-0-79858";"Tell me about these sites you want me to visit."
"228103012-0-79861";"How did Ithelia escape?"
"228103012-0-79871";"This is Elenglynn. We believe the shrine is dedicated to a Daedric Prince."
"228103012-0-79874";"How will things be interesting."
"228103012-0-79875";"What did the Echonir show you?"
"228103012-0-79887";"I have many questions for you."
"228103012-0-79888";"We were trying to calm the unstable magic. Who are you?"
"228103012-0-79889";"What are you suggesting?"
"228103012-0-79895";"Ulfsild didn't send us. Who is she?"
"228103012-0-79897";"What are you going on about?"
"228103012-0-79898";"The Crow seems to think I can learn more about Scribing from the Luminaries."
"228103012-0-79900";"What are you planning to do now?"
"228103012-0-79913";"Is that a problem? Most people can't see fate."
"228103012-0-79914";"Who's Lady Valente?"
"228103012-0-79923";"It sounded like the Blind knew you."
"228103012-0-79928";"It sounded like The Blind knew you."
"228103012-0-79929";"How long have you been Chef Donolon's apprentice?"
"228103012-0-79930";"Why are you here instead of the Maelstrom Arena?"
"228103012-0-79931";"What do you think you owe, Maerenah?"
"228103012-0-79932";"How do you know about a spare vault key?"
"228103012-0-79934";"Do you have an extra lockpick?"
"228103012-0-79936";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"228103012-0-79938";"She's going to report in to the Mages Guild and request some assistance here."
"228103012-0-79939";"How do we do that?"
"228103012-0-79946";"Yes, here are your ingredients."
"228103012-0-79947";"Remind me about the Recollection."
"228103012-0-79948";"Remind me: Who are the Recollection?"
"228103012-0-79949";"Remind me: Who are the Recollection?"
"228103012-0-79951";"I'm listening."
"228103012-0-79953";"<Continue to Listen>"
"228103012-0-79954";"Were you able to convince Count Calantius to send more legionaries to Rustwall Estate?"
"228103012-0-79955";"How did you find me?"
"228103012-0-79956";"Why do you live in Skingrad?"
"228103012-0-79957";"You're sure the Vashabar Wood Elves aren't responsible for the Wildburn?"
"228103012-0-79967";"It looks like Ulfsild's notes lead to Auridon."
"228103012-0-79969";"What's the significance?"
