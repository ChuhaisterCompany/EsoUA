"187173764-0-9040";"This one never trusted Ambassador Tarinwe. At least we'll have an embassy in Elden Root."
"187173764-0-9125";"Northpoint was liberated, but did you hear what Baron Dorell did? He arrested his own son! That man is heartless, I tell you, Heartless!"
"187173764-0-9144";"High King Emeric's truly blessed. He's survived another attempt on his life!"
"187173764-0-9268";"The Crestshade refugees are safe, but Captain Janeve didn't survive the battle. I heard she died a hero."
"187173764-0-9318";"I heard you convinced Martin Dathieu to enlist in the guard. I hope he's half the soldier his father was."

"187173764-0-9349";"That traitorous bastard Montclair is hiding atop the Doomcrag! Reports from the front say the guard are now in control of the Shrouded Pass."

"187173764-1-632";"I grew up with Sir Hughes. Thank you for sparing his life."
"187173764-1-769";"You saved King Emeric, didn't you? I can't wait to tell my friend we met."
"187173764-1-970";"The Knights of the Flame say you saved their order. That's high praise."
"187173764-1-2114";"Oh! I know you! Ingride Vanne told me to give you her regards!"
"187173764-1-2151";"Sir Hughes was once a good man, but killing Duchess Lakana could not be forgiven."
"187173764-1-2650";"So you are the one King Fahara'jad has placed his faith in? I hope it is well-founded."
"187173764-1-2685";"My friend Mordroc said you helped him...wouldn't share specifics though..."
"187173764-1-2726";"What you have done at Tu'whacca's throne...we will never forget."
"187173764-1-2764";"What you accomplished at Tava's Blessing was a miracle! The gods are surely with you!"
"187173764-1-2989";"The liberator of Satakalaam! I salute you!"
"187173764-1-3023";"Some lucky bastard solved Frodibert Fontbonne's last puzzle. Wish that were me!"
"187173764-1-3037";"Glad you got that lunatic Serge off Miranda Arcole's neck. Well done."
"187173764-1-3050";"You were involved in that mess at Farangel's Landing, weren't you? Sad business."
"187173764-1-3055";"I heard you had to kill Master Muzgu to stop the Supernal Dreamers. Tough choice."
"187173764-1-3056";"Say, didn't you save Master Muzgu? We're clan-brothers! Can't thank you enough."
"187173764-1-3098";"Count Hosni's so thrilled with what you did for him, he's throwing another party!"
"187173764-1-3148";"I hear old Aphren's Hold is no longer haunted...if that was you, you have my thanks."
"187173764-1-3174";"You brought Constable Pascal to justice, didn't you? That poor man."
"187173764-1-3190";"Poor Princess Lakana! Thank you for trying to save her."
"187173764-1-3646";"I'm just glad there were some survivors at the Mill. It could have been so much worse."
"187173764-1-3648";"I heard that Duke Sebastien was a werewolf, but they cured him."
"187173764-1-3656";"I heard that Duke Sebastien was a werewolf, so they killed him."
"187173764-1-3676";"They say the Wyresses drove an old witch out of the Hag Fen. Even so, the Wyrd Sisters make me nervous."
"187173764-1-3692";"Someone told me that Duke Sebastien is a werewolf. Can you believe it?"
"187173764-1-3872";"There is too much skooma coming into the Alik'r. Someone needs to stop these Bandaari!"
"187173764-1-3873";"It's about time someone put a stop to the skooma trade here. You are a hero, my friend."
"187173764-1-3925";"There's the one that defeated the corrupted spirit inside of the Wyrd Tree."
"187173764-1-3956";"An undead werewolf took over Camlorn? An undead ... Werewolf? How does that even work?"
"187173764-1-3968";"Rumor is the soldiers at the Redoubt are going to move on to Cath Bedraud.  May the Eight protect them."
"187173764-1-4056";"The mines at Crosswych are invaluable. I'm not surprised the Red Rooks tried to take control of the place."
"187173764-1-4111";"Angof's gone, but I wonder how long his creepy vines are going to stick around."
"187173764-1-4118";"Heard they found some dead treasure hunter out by Badwater Mine. Cursed gemstones."
"187173764-1-4119";"It seems some treasure hunter looted the Old Badwater Mine. Good for them."
"187173764-1-4278";"You were the one who saved Camp Tamrith and killed Reezal-Jul? I hope you made him suffer."
"187173764-1-4476";"You're the hero who defeated Alexandra Conele at Vivec's Antlers!"
"187173764-1-4481";"I understand you were instrumental in crushing the Daggerfall army at Davon's Watch."
"187173764-1-4508";"There were rumors of Dark Elves disappearing near Malak's Maw. Turns out a gang of Orcs were behind it."
"187173764-1-4523";"I recognize you! Donel Fontbonne sends his thanks for finding his inheritance."
"187173764-1-4545";"I was sad to hear about the troubles in Silent Mire. Pirates, kidnapping. Is no place safe anymore?"
"187173764-1-4561";"The hero who defeated General Serien is always a welcome sight."
"187173764-1-4564";"General Godrun says he owes his life to you...and his honor."
"187173764-1-4567";"You saved countless lives, uncovering Rhavil Urano's treachery."
"187173764-1-4595";"There was a problem at Deepcrag and I heard the owner sent his wife away.  Very curious."
"187173764-1-4600";"I grew up in Narsis. I can't be this stupid plague almost turned the place into a ghost town."
"187173764-1-4642";"You helped strengthen the Pact in Stormhold. Thank you."
"187173764-1-4652";"Omin Dres won't shut up about you."
"187173764-1-4675";"I heard the Vereansu attacked Muth Gnaar because the monks were using some sort of Daedric artifact."
"187173764-1-4703";"When Drillk died, so did the source of the Knahaten Flu. You protected us all."
"187173764-1-4732";"You're the hero of Ash Mountain, the slayer of Balreth!"
"187173764-1-4951";"Strangers in black helped House Hlaalu at the Gorge. Do you think ... No, that's impossible. They're all gone now."
"187173764-1-4956";"I heard rumors you found a keystone. To hold such power!"
"187173764-1-5037";"Did you hear about Deepcrag Den? The poison leak? No one is really sure what happened."
"187173764-1-5046";"This Drillk thinks himself a king, does he? Fine, as long as he bows to the Pact."
"187173764-1-5060";"Can you believe it? I saw Almalexia herself! I am forever blessed by the Healing Mother."
"187173764-1-5061";"How could anyone, let alone a Dark Elf, desecrate the Shrine of Saint Veloth? It's scandalous!"
"187173764-1-5077";"Magistrix Vox was finally defeated. What a shame, I heard she used to be one of Almalexia's hand maidens."
"187173764-1-5088";"You couldn't free those Imperial soldiers from White Rose. They're the enemy."
"187173764-1-5094";"I served time in White Rose. Horrible place. You made the right choice, friend."
"187173764-1-5096";"Magistrix Vox nearly destroyed Selfora, just because the people refused to bow down to her."
"187173764-1-5131";"If it weren't for your heroism and Tanval's sacrifice, Stonefalls would've been destroyed by that monster."
"187173764-1-5269";"I heard that you were there when the Reachmen released Sinmur's ghost."
"187173764-1-5359";"I hear you taught the Reachman Stral a bloody lesson."
"187173764-1-5364";"Why'd you give Tavo's treasure to the debt collector? Such a shame."
"187173764-1-5365";"You're the one who sent that debt collector in Kozanset packing. Your chivalry has no equal!"
"187173764-1-5376";"The liberator of Fallowstone Hall! Your bravery is legendary."
"187173764-1-5409";"A strong Argonian woman become leader of the Fighters Guild...and she's slain! Typical."
"187173764-1-5415";"I heard you uncovered a lost shrine in Fungal Grotto. How eerie."
"187173764-1-5429";"Have you heard? A High Elven woman named Valaste returned Eyevea to the Summerset Isles!"
"187173764-1-5483";"I don't care if they're under control. I'm not going to Lower Yorgrim until the giants go away."
"187173764-1-5496";"You're the one who saved For Zeren. Terrible what happened at Foyen Docks, though."
"187173764-1-5501";"Weren't you at Foyen docks? I hear they never would have held without you."
"187173764-1-5504";"Have you heard of that Sees-All-Colors? Cannot believe the Fighters Guild let her live."
"187173764-1-5509";"I was relieved to hear that Voljar's Meadery has reopened. Good mead warms the soul!"
"187173764-1-5575";"I heard there was an attempt on Jorunn the Skald-King's life."
"187173764-1-5602";"I heard that the ghost of Queen Nurnhilde was seen in Fort Morvunskar."
"187173764-1-5613";"Seems as if the Pact leaders are preparing to take on the Skald-King's traitorous brother."
"187173764-1-5624";"My brother joined that Bad Man cult. Word is they're all dead now. I never liked my brother much."
"187173764-1-5644";"Who did the Hound think he was to steal the Green Lady's sister, Rajhin himself?"
"187173764-1-5650";"Now Cradlecrush is crawling with giants? Is that better? Really?"
"187173764-1-5701";"Divines protect you, just as you protected our honored Keepers."
"187173764-1-5719";"The Nords can be valuable allies. That is, when they're not fighting among themselves."
"187173764-1-5720";"At last the troublemaker, Fildgor, is dead. The Pact can move forward and I can return home."
"187173764-1-5734";"Let me get this straight. The King was poisoned and an Argonian saved him by entering his dreams? That's a little far-fetched."
"187173764-1-5736";"I hear the Silvenar ate his advisor's heart. Bosmer memorial rituals are nasty business."
"187173764-1-5784";"You're the one who stopped Thallik from opening the portal to Oblivion!"
"187173764-1-5789";"To be with the Silvenar on his wedding day. Must have been a real honor for you."
"187173764-1-5827";"It can't have been easy to sacrifice Arithiel. What an awful choice."
"187173764-1-5831";"Spy or not, Aera Earth-Turner deserved better than death."
"187173764-1-5851";"You helped Arithiel stop Mauloch? If only I could walk in her shadow!"
"187173764-1-5865";"Can Dark Elves, Nords, and Argonians actually work together? If not, this alliance is doomed."
"187173764-1-5885";"You were at Fullhelm Fort. You save Thane Unnvald's life!"
"187173764-1-5886";"You're the one who caught the traitor Thorulf. Too bad about Thane Unnvald - but Hallfrida's a good leader."
"187173764-1-5935";"They say Ysgramor himself appeared after the ghost of Sinmur was defeated."
"187173764-1-5955";"You exposed Captain Cularalda's true colors. Velyn Harbor owes you for that."
"187173764-1-6012";"I've heard tales of your valor at Ezduiin. Bravely done!"
"187173764-1-6027";"Bet the dead of Tanzelwil had a lot to say about Ayrenn."
"187173764-1-6095";"I heard you drove those cannibals out of the Forgotten Crypts. Must've been a horrifying scene down there."
"187173764-1-6096";"My friend Sela's been talking about you! Thanks for helping her, and kicking out those corpse-eating lunatics."
"187173764-1-6156";"All of Wayrest is talking about you. You're a hero for taking down those Pellingares."
"187173764-1-6161";"You completed Geirmund's three challenges? Unbelievable."
"187173764-1-6181";"You fought the agents of Mehrunes Dagon, and won! The savior of Firsthold!"
"187173764-1-6197";"I've heard of your deeds in Phaer, traveler. That was justice well done."
"187173764-1-6270";"Captain Khammo makes a fantastic pirate. You really turned his life around."
"187173764-1-6300";"The goodness you showed that Aldarch at Torinaan. Divines bless and keep you."
"187173764-1-6304";"I heard what you did at the Guard, traveler. Auri-el keep you safe."
"187173764-1-6379";"Is it true, Lodorr came back from the dead? And you killed him again? Fantastic!"
"187173764-1-6426";"I heard Bloodthorn assassins tried to kill King Casimir."
"187173764-1-6446";"They let a Red Rook help the Lion Guard at Eagle's Brook? I hope the soldiers double checked their supplies afterwards."
"187173764-1-6447";"My cousin trades with Eagle's Brook. I hope his business doesn't suffer after that attack."
"187173764-1-6480";"Estre was a traitor! And deserved to be put down."
"187173764-1-6526";"I heard you let that woman at Phaer have real justice. Auri-el would approve."
"187173764-1-6603";"You wouldn't catch me anywhere near that Crypt of Hearts! Leave that to braver folk like yourself."
"187173764-1-6654";"I heard that people were beaten and starving down in that Tower of Lies prison. I wonder if they were hungry enough to...never mind."
"187173764-1-6657";"This one lost friends in Haven. But you avenged them, I hear. Many owe you their thanks."
"187173764-1-6924";"You kept the Silvenar and the Green Lady from harm. You're alright."
"187173764-1-6965";"Blaise from the Mage's Guild told me that you're one to be trusted."
"187173764-1-6966";"They say Aera Earth-Turner was working with the Worm Cult."
"187173764-1-6976";"I heard you battled the Worm Cult in Rulanyil's Fall. What would they want with an old museum like that?"
"187173764-1-6996";"I heard about Mathragor. You know what it means to settle a score."
"187173764-1-6997";"After all he'd been through, you couldn't let Mathragor get his justice? Figures."
"187173764-1-7019";"I lost a lot of money betting against you in that Crucible fight. You're a lucky one."
"187173764-1-7032";"I hear that troublemaker Captain Rama wound up dead. What a shame, eh? Ha ha!"
"187173764-1-7033";"So, you caught that captain who set the Goblins on Cumberland's Watch. Nice work."
"187173764-1-7060";"You stood against the darkness at Moonmont. The Dro-m'Athra. Moons be praised!"
"187173764-1-7209";"Have you heard about the Daggers? They killed an entire flock of harpies with their bare hands. Makes the Fighters Guild look like amatuers."
"187173764-1-7211";"Not one in a million can claim they've slain a Maormer Stormreeve. Damned impressive!"
"187173764-1-7252";"This one has heard how you saved the Mane at Driladan Pass."
"187173764-1-7253";"Someone said the Daggers have gone north to look for work. Anyone know who  the Daggers are, by the way?"
"187173764-1-7280";"You stood against the Daedra in Dune. Bright moons be praised!"
"187173764-1-7285";"Sud-Hareem's a friend of mine - I want to thank you for saving him and his son."
"187173764-1-7289";"Sud-Hareem told me what happened in Spindleclutch - you helped him make a hard choice. The right choice."
"187173764-1-7343";"This one wonders if Captain Khammo enjoys Anvil. You must visit him sometime."
"187173764-1-7398";"I heard what happened at Moonmont, Hallowed. Moons be praised for your bravery."
"187173764-1-7400";"There's the one that made peace with the giants in Lower Yorgrim."
"187173764-1-7402";"You're the one who discovered Vicereeve Pelidil's involvement with the Veiled Heritance."
"187173764-1-7424";"From what I've heard, the Orcthane deserved a traitor's death."
"187173764-1-7431";"They say Argonians can smell skin-stealers. Must be why they went after the lizards first."
"187173764-1-7434";"You slayed Captain Blackheart! Thank the divines for brave souls like you."
"187173764-1-7524";"Did you hear that someone actually escaped from the Lightless Oubliette?"
"187173764-1-7536";"The Hatching Pools recover, due to your efforts. You are truly a friend to the Hist."
"187173764-1-7557";"Did you hear about the town of Long Haven? Vampires were luring the villagers into the mist."
"187173764-1-7572";"It's good you killed that skin-stealing alchemist. Paid him back for Hrondar, eh?"
"187173764-1-7574";"The Dominion never should've gone to Loriasel. The lamias ate them for breakfast!"
"187173764-1-7626";"Did you hear that Vanus Galerion was rescued from the Black Forge?"
"187173764-1-7656";"I heard that they discovered a Light of Meridia floating above the Library of Dusk."
"187173764-1-7709";"The Thizzrini champion, here before me!"
"187173764-1-7710";"This one has heard of your bravery. You drove the Colovians from Arenthia!"
"187173764-1-7727";"Hey there. My friend Stibbons wanted me to say hello, tell you 'thanks again'."
"187173764-1-7728";"Apparently, they found this crazy old Breton lost in the desert. Stibbons...that was his name."
"187173764-1-7767";"You saved those poor mages trapped within Elden Hollow. An honorable deed."
"187173764-1-7798";"You are the one they say joined the Ash'abah. I cannot imagine why."
"187173764-1-7799";"If it is true that you have joined the Ash'abah...you are not welcome in my home."
"187173764-1-7804";"The official word is that Vicereeve Pelidil used Prince Naemon for his own evil ends."
"187173764-1-7871";"Bakkhara says you convinced her to put down her brother. He was always arrogant, that one."
"187173764-1-7876";"They say Molag Grunda guarded the gatehouse on the Chasm. I didn't see her. Nor did I want to."
"187173764-1-7915";"The Hallowed! You stood with the Champions at Rawl'kha!"
"187173764-1-7929";"You are the Hallowed. The one that walked the Path with the Mane! Bright moons!"
"187173764-1-7971";"You exposed the Magistrate in Bergama. Thank you for seeing justice was served."
"187173764-1-7972";"Justice Istah still languishes in the stocks in Bergama! With no evidence, how can this be?"
"187173764-1-8105";"My son studies at Leki's Blade. He told me you saved the school from great danger. Thank you!"
"187173764-1-8106";"The old master of Leki's Blade is a traveling teacher now. She has more students, thanks to you."
"187173764-1-8124";"With the Great Shackle destroyed, has the Planemeld been stopped?"
"187173764-1-8125";"With the Great Shackle destroyed, has the Planemeld been stopped?"
"187173764-1-8126";"With the Great Shackle destroyed, has the Planemeld been stopped?"
"187173764-1-8127";"With the Great Shackle destroyed, has the Planemeld been stopped?"
"187173764-1-8152";"It is the calm after the storm. We must pick up the pieces and continue, despite all the things we lost."
"187173764-1-8178";"I heard that someone closed the portal at Moonhenge, and escaped while the Daedric realm was collapsing."
"187173764-1-8194";"Bright moon, you are the one who chased down Pelidil's ship and defeated him!"
"187173764-1-8199";"I love the trained bugs at Sarandel's Carnival. They're just so colorful!"
"187173764-1-8200";"I don't know the tribe in the Gray Mire, but I know your deeds there. May the Hist remember you always, friend."
"187173764-1-8275";"You recovered all three of the Ansei Wards. This is a cause for joyful celebration!"
"187173764-1-8282";"You've been beneath the Grimwatch. You've seen the Khajiiti ruins. Fascinating!"
"187173764-1-8290";"The Fighters Guild was cruel to cast out Sees-All-Colors. She was brave to do as she did."
"187173764-1-8297";"Those mines needed to be closed. I'm glad you convinced Kasal to finally do so."
"187173764-1-8298";"Shagora doesn't remember her friend Seqbar, but she's very fond of you."
"187173764-1-8553";"Montclair bastards! Attacked the Shornhelm Guard at Hinault Farm! But I heard everything turned out fine."
"187173764-1-8554";"You! You were the one who helped Lieutenant Fairfax and the guard at Hinault Farm. You have my thanks."
"187173764-1-8649";"You were the one that helped Count Ravenwatch explore the Lorkrata ruins? Did you find something to stop the blood-curse?"
"187173764-1-8686";"The queen's a strong woman. Glad she's taking care of the city, not some regent."
"187173764-1-8687";"Did you hear about Duke Renchant? Dead! And well-deserved, may he rot forever!"
"187173764-1-8716";"Sheogorath, in Southpoint? The tales can't be true, can they? No, of course not."
"187173764-1-8717";"I wonder how long Southpoint's mayor will survive in the Shivering Isles. Hopefully, not very."
"187173764-1-8771";"Now that Rivenspire is safe, High King Emeric finally decided to crown a ruler for Shornhelm. It's about time, I say!"
"187173764-1-8786";"I heard the Jade Dragoons were nearly destroyed by frost trolls. Frost trolls!"
"187173764-1-8800";"I saw several Reachmen run north, headed home. May a werewolf devour them before they get there!"
"187173764-1-8808";"I'm not surprised Duke Renchant's dead, but I didn't think the queen would...take care of things herself."
"187173764-1-8882";"I knew we never should have trusted Baron Montclair. Thanks for saving the city."
"187173764-1-8918";"The garrison's ever protected the pass, and it's ours once more. And the less we hear about Imperials or Reachmen, the better."
"187173764-1-8940";"What the Imperials didn't steal or destroy will soon be for sale to desperate people. That's the hidden cost of any war."
"187173764-1-8943";"The Blacksap Rebellion out of Cormount, and its leaders on trial. I never thought I'd see the day."
"187173764-1-8944";"Cormount was like a wasp's nest. You were a bold one to shove your hand inside."
"187173764-1-8947";"Don't believe the rumors. Prince Naemon died protecting the queen in the Orrery."
"187173764-1-9005";"You helped the High King select Queen Eselde? What an excellent choice, friend!"
"187173764-1-9006";"All hail King Alard, ruler of Shornhelm! May his wisdom and courage guide us for years to come!"
"187173764-1-9040";"You made certain the Khajiit will have a voice in Elden Root. Thank you, walker."
"187173764-1-9125";"Lord Ellic Dorell must have been working with the Montclairs. Why else would his father throw him in the stocks?"
"187173764-1-9144";"They say someone brought High King Emeric back from the dead. From the dead! I don't know what to believe any more."
"187173764-1-9268";"You were the one who saved Camp Tamrith and killed Reezal-Jul? I hope his end was long and painful."
"187173764-1-9318";"The guard certainly needs more recruits, but who thought that Martin Dathieu would make a good soldier?"
"187173764-1-9319";"The guard certainly needs more recruits, but who thought that Martin Dathieu would make a good soldier?"
"187173764-1-9320";"The guard certainly needs more recruits, but who thought that Martin Dathieu would make a good soldier?"
"187173764-1-9321";"The guard certainly needs more recruits, but who thought that Martin Dathieu would make a good soldier?"
"187173764-1-9349";"I can't believe our troops are climbing the Shrouded Pass. I guess it's the only way to reach the Doomcrag, but I wouldn't want to be up there!"
"187173764-1-9363";"Someone was playing with Daedric magic out at the Edrald estate. Opened a portal to Oblivion and everything!"
"187173764-1-9369";"Someone was playing with Daedric magic out at the Edrald estate. Opened a portal to Oblivion and everything!"
"187173764-1-9370";"Someone was playing with Daedric magic out at the Edrald estate. Opened a portal to Oblivion and everything!"
"187173764-1-9371";"Someone was playing with Daedric magic out at the Edrald estate. Opened a portal to Oblivion and everything!"
"187173764-2-769";"Heard you were the one who saved the king's life...thank you!"
"187173764-2-970";"What happened at Firebrand Keep was downright embarrasing. Glad you restored order."
"187173764-2-2114";"Ingride Vanne speaks highly of you. If you're high in her esteem, you're high in mine."
"187173764-2-2650";"They say you are the one who fights the Withered Hand. Tu'whacca watch over you."
"187173764-2-2685";"One night I met a monkey who claimed to be an Orc! Imagine that!"
"187173764-2-2726";"The Throne Keeper says you cleansed Tu'whacca's throne. Truly one favored by the gods."
"187173764-2-2764";"I am told the threat to Tava's Blessing has subsided thanks to you. It is an honor to meet you."
"187173764-2-2989";"I hear you helped drive the damned Imperials out of Satakalaam. Long live the Covenant!"
"187173764-2-3098";"So Count Hosni's back to normal -- thanks to you, eh, stranger?"
"187173764-2-3174";"Captain Curran told me of how you helped him in Koeglin Village. Well done."
"187173764-2-3190";"It is rare for General Thoda to offer word of praise, but he speaks highly of you."
"187173764-2-3646";"You cut the forest and the forest cuts back. Bet those witches had something to do with all these nature problems."
"187173764-2-3648";"Someone told me that Gloria Fausta gave her life to cure Duke Sebastien of the werewolf's curse."
"187173764-2-3656";"Did you hear? Duke Sebastien was a werewolf and he ate his entire family."
"187173764-2-3676";"Someone has finally defeated that old crone, Mother Murk. Maybe the Hag Fen will be safer now."
"187173764-2-3692";"You won't see much of Duke Sebastien anymore. He's a werewolf, so they locked him up and threw away the key."
"187173764-2-3925";"I heard that someone killed all the cultists and saved the Wyrd Tree."
"187173764-2-3956";"If an Orc was in charge, Camlorn would have never fallen to a bunch of mangy werewolves."
"187173764-2-3968";"Bet the Lion Guard could use another strong Orc. Maybe I'll head to the Redoubt and offer my services."
"187173764-2-4056";"I worked the Crosswych mines a while back. Glad to know the town is safe again."
"187173764-2-4111";"You saved Glenumbra? Really? I guess I'm impressed."
"187173764-2-4476";"If you hadn't stopped the Covenant from summoning Sadal, we'd all be dead."
"187173764-2-4481";"The hero of Davon's Watch. What I wouldn't have given to see Balreth destroy the Daggerfall army."
"187173764-2-4508";"House Redoran spotted Orcs at Malak's Maw. They were harassing travelers. Everything's under control now, praise Almalexia!"
"187173764-2-4545";"Some of the lizard folk were attacked in Silent Mire. It's just an old swamp, so at least nothing valuable was ruined."
"187173764-2-4561";"You defended Fort Virac against General Serien. A friend of mine fought there!"
"187173764-2-4564";"You're the one who killed Skull Crusher, aren't you? Brave Meeting!"
"187173764-2-4567";"Because of you, the Pact was able to defend Vivec's Antlers."
"187173764-2-4595";"I heard you helped the Deepcrag miners. That was mighty brave of you."
"187173764-2-4600";"Almost joined the Maulborn myself. They seemed like good people doing good work. Did they fool me!"
"187173764-2-4642";"I'm glad Stormhold is safe again. But why did the killer restrict himself to Dunmer?"
"187173764-2-4652";"That was a brave deed, rescuing Sen Dres."
"187173764-2-4675";"The Muth Gnaar monks use an ancient Daedric artifact to heal. How dare the Vereansu interfere with their holy work."
"187173764-2-4732";"Did you really defeat the Daedra Balreth blindfolded?"
"187173764-2-4951";"Even if you hadn't destroyed those shipments, I'm sure the Tribunal would have stopped the plague before it reached Mournhold."
"187173764-2-4956";"They say Shadowscales are killers in the night. Then how do they explain Murkwater?"
"187173764-2-5037";"Rumor has it that Deepcrag Den was sabotaged. By one of its own workers!"
"187173764-2-5060";"Maybe the restrictions in Mournhold will ease now that the Temple is safe again."
"187173764-2-5061";"I can't believe Vox smashed Saint Veloth's reliquary. Thank you for helping to restore it."
"187173764-2-5077";"You were at Eidolon's Hollow and survived? You must be stronger than a mammoth!"
"187173764-2-5096";"Why would Vox attack her own people in Selfora? It's madness!"
"187173764-2-5131";"You're the hero who defeated Sadal at tormented spire. My respect."
"187173764-2-5269";"You're the one who warned the Pact about Sinmur's ghost."
"187173764-2-5359";"You were with Dajaheel and Belron when Stral was defeated."
"187173764-2-5376";"Is it true Wuuthrad was stolen from Fallowstone Hall?"
"187173764-2-5409";"This one thinks that Sees-All-Colors got what was coming to her. Traitorous Argonian scum."
"187173764-2-5415";"Well, if it isn't the new King of the Grotto! You ask me, those beasts got what was coming to them."
"187173764-2-5429";"The Mages Guild is recruiting to fill roles on their fancy new island refuge. Eyevea, I think? Impressive."
"187173764-2-5483";"You won't catch me visiting Lower Yorgrim. There are too many giants in that place."
"187173764-2-5504";"A noble Khajiiti woman like Aelif is murdered, and an avowed Daedra-worshiping Argonian is given a role in the Fighters Guild leadership. This one is sickened."
"187173764-2-5509";"Heard the Orcthane sent thugs to harass the owners of Voljar's Meadery. But you can't keep a good Nord down."
"187173764-2-5575";"Aren't you the Champion of Windhelm? The one that stopped Fildgor Orcthane?"
"187173764-2-5602";"Did you hear? Someone stole Queen Nurnhilde's body from the Royal Tombs."
"187173764-2-5613";"The King and his councilors are camped at Jorunn's Stand, getting ready to move against Fildgor Orcthane. It's about time, I say."
"187173764-2-5624";"The Bad Man! The Bad Man! The Bad Man is dead!"
"187173764-2-5644";"You rescued the Green Lady's sister? Is she unmarried? You should introduce me."
"187173764-2-5650";"Mess with the mammoths and you get the giants rilled up. Just look at what happened at Cradlecrush."
"187173764-2-5701";"By the Empyrean Light, it's the savior of the Keepers!"
"187173764-2-5719";"King Jorunn is truly merciful to let his traitorous brother live."
"187173764-2-5720";"I heard someone gave Fildgor a warrior's death. Was that you?"
"187173764-2-5734";"You saved the King. You are a friend to all Nord people this day."
"187173764-2-5736";"What was the Silvenar's advisor, the one who died? Terrible shame."
"187173764-2-5784";"Did you hear that Thallik tried to open a portal to Oblivion?"
"187173764-2-5789";"You were at the Green Lady's wedding, weren't you? She must have been resplendent."
"187173764-2-5865";"So Fildgor poisoned his own brother? And he expects the Nords to follow him? He's more foolish than I imagined."
"187173764-2-5935";"Aren't you the one who defeated the ghost of Sinmur?"
"187173764-2-5955";"Why did those Wood Orcs think the Covenant could take Velyn Harbor? Madness."
"187173764-2-6012";"Amazing to think you've been in the field with Telenger himself. Simply amazing."
"187173764-2-6027";"Amazing to stand at the heart of Tanzelwil, isn't it. You can hear the Ancestors whisper."
"187173764-2-6156";"Look there! It's the one who brought those Pellingare brats to justice!"
"187173764-2-6161";"Your reputation spreads far and wide, Geirmund's Guardian."
"187173764-2-6181";"My brother was stationed at Firsthold. Thank you, traveler."
"187173764-2-6300";"The Divines walked at your side at Torinaan. Auri-el bless you."
"187173764-2-6304";"So you're the one that saved the Queen, eh? You don't look that special."
"187173764-2-6379";"Caught the King's old mage red-handed in Lodorr's tomb, did you? You've got my thanks."
"187173764-2-6426";"Did you hear about the attempt on the King's life? Someone saved him!"
"187173764-2-6446";"You helped save Eagle's Brook? I thought you'd be taller."
"187173764-2-6447";"I heard cultists took over Eagle's Brook. We should double our security here."
"187173764-2-6480";"Lady Estre was our true Queen! Damn you for killing her!"
"187173764-2-6603";"You walked into the Crypt of Hearts...and survived? I don't believe it!"
"187173764-2-6654";"This one was glad he was not in a hole in the ground called the Tower of Lies. Only in Coldharbour is a hole called a tower."
"187173764-2-6657";"They say Lord Gharesh-ri saved Haven from pirates. But this one knows it was you."
"187173764-2-6924";"You showed those Wood Orcs. It's what they get for betraying the Green Lady."
"187173764-2-6976";"Say, you're the one who exposed that swindler Endarwe, aren't you? Ha! Ayleid warlord my arse."
"187173764-2-7019";"Hail, Champion of the Crucible!"
"187173764-2-7209";"Saw that group that calls itself the Daggers earlier. Never seen people drink so much. Wonder what they're celebrating."
"187173764-2-7211";"You're the one who stopped the Maormer offensive! Divines bless you!"
"187173764-2-7252";"Thank you for saving the Mane at Driladan Pass."
"187173764-2-7253";"I heard that poor Lord Diel met a tragic end in the Shrieking Scar. About time someone took care of that bastard."
"187173764-2-7280";"You saved my life, traveler. I was in Dune the day of the attack. Thank you."
"187173764-2-7400";"I heard that Skorvild baited the giants into attacking Lower Yorgrim."
"187173764-2-7402";"Can you believe there was a spy in the Thalmor at Woodhearth?"
"187173764-2-7424";"It must have been hard for King Jorunn to kill his own brother."
"187173764-2-7431";"When did the skin-stealers take Hrondar? Weeks ago? Months? Years?"
"187173764-2-7434";"Look there! That's the one what bested Captain Blackheart and banished his crew!"
"187173764-2-7524";"Have you heard that King Lalorian has returned? He's going to lead the Fighters Guild now."
"187173764-2-7536";"My hatchling lives because of you. I tell all I see, so your legend will grow in the Hist."
"187173764-2-7557";"You're the one who helped that Dunmer vampire hunter drive the vampires out of Long Haven."
"187173764-2-7626";"Vanus Galerion tried to destroy the Black Forge all by himself. He was captured, but someone rescued him."
"187173764-2-7656";"Someone told me that the Library of Dusk is a trap for smart people. I guess we're safe then."
"187173764-2-7709";"The Thizzrini champion! Here, before me!"
"187173764-2-7710";"You were with the Resistance at Arenthia. Bright moons!"
"187173764-2-7804";"The Veiled Heritance is broken, there is a new Silvenar, and we have you to thank!"
"187173764-2-7876";"I heard you were there when Molag Grunda was defeated. Well done."
"187173764-2-7915";"Moons guide you on path, Hallowed. Guide you in all things."
"187173764-2-7929";"You...you are the Hallowed. You walked the Path with the Mane!"
"187173764-2-8124";"I heard the Great Shackle was destroyed! I hope that means the Planemeld has been stopped."
"187173764-2-8125";"I heard the Great Shackle was destroyed! I hope that means the Planemeld has been stopped."
"187173764-2-8126";"I heard the Great Shackle was destroyed! I hope that means the Planemeld has been stopped."
"187173764-2-8127";"I heard the Great Shackle was destroyed! I hope that means the Planemeld has been stopped."
"187173764-2-8152";"Hah! The Hero of Coldharbour walks among us."
"187173764-2-8178";"Did you really destroy the Daedric portal at Moonhenge all by yourself?"
"187173764-2-8194";"Thanks to you, Vicereeve Pelidil is dead and the Dominion has one enemy fewer."
"187173764-2-8199";"This one knows the truth. The Argonians in the Gray Mire were spies. You did well to send them away."
"187173764-2-8200";"The storyteller at Sarandel's Carnival ... how could he get Bosmer history so wrong?"
"187173764-2-8275";"You are the one who destroyed the Withered Hand! You are a hero!"
"187173764-2-8282";"I had a sister stationed at Grimwatch. Thanks for what you did for them."
"187173764-2-8290";"The Fighters Guild is a nest of snakes. They should have put that Argonian to the sword."
"187173764-2-8649";"There's an Ayleid ruin under the Lorkrata Hills? I never suspected such a thing!"
"187173764-2-8686";"If the Duke were an Orc, he'd have killed himself by now. He brings shame to Evermore."
"187173764-2-8687";"Glad to see the queen finally show her backbone. The duke deserved death for what he did."
"187173764-2-8771";"I heard what you did at the Doomcrag. I don't know if I could have been as half as brave as you, but thanks for what you did."
"187173764-2-8786";"A terrible shame about General Endare. I suppose you had to do what was best."
"187173764-2-8800";"A little bird spoke to me outside the inn. Said the Reachmen's leader was dead. Never had a bird talk to me before."
"187173764-2-8808";"The queen killed the Duke. Strong, decisive. I like that. And she's a widow. Hm...."
"187173764-2-8882";"I heard the battle in the Fevered Mews was touch and go. Glad you won the day."
"187173764-2-8918";"The garrison's safe now, but there'll soon be another fight. Another way to raise our weapons in battle. Mark my words."
"187173764-2-8940";"My family's together for the first time since the Imperials left! Praise the gods, we've survived!"
"187173764-2-8947";"King Camoran Aeradan knows his place. He made no attempt to use the Orrery for himself."
"187173764-2-9040";"This one heard you captured the High Elf ambassador for her crimes in Elden Root. Well done, walker."
"187173764-2-9125";"Lady Lleraya was a vampire? I'm glad you defeated her and saved Northpoint."
"187173764-2-9144";"Other kings step back, but High King Emeric charges ahead! He's lucky someone keeps saving him from disaster."
"187173764-2-9318";"Captain Thayer certainly found a bumper crop of guard recruits at Hoarfrost Downs. I wonder how he did it."
"187173764-2-9319";"Captain Thayer certainly found a bumper crop of guard recruits at Hoarfrost Downs. I wonder how he did it."
"187173764-2-9320";"Captain Thayer certainly found a bumper crop of guard recruits at Hoarfrost Downs. I wonder how he did it."
"187173764-2-9321";"Captain Thayer certainly found a bumper crop of guard recruits at Hoarfrost Downs. I wonder how he did it."
"187173764-2-9349";"Baron Dorell and Countess Tamrith led the assault against Baron Montclair! We never would have taken the Shrouded Pass without their leadership!"
"187173764-2-9363";"Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!"
"187173764-2-9369";"Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!"
"187173764-2-9370";"Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!"
"187173764-2-9371";"Daedric magic at the Edrald estate? I'm just glad you were able to close that portal!"
"187173764-3-769";"Look here. If it isn't King Emeric's own champion. The hero of the Covenant!"
"187173764-3-970";"Knights of the Flame came very near dissolution, were it not for you."
"187173764-3-2114";"The Vanne Family says you saved their farm. Well done."
"187173764-3-2650";"Is it true the Impervious Vault was robbed? I did not deem that possible!"
"187173764-3-2685";"My friend Mordroc told me you saved him from being a monkey. Crazy talk!"
"187173764-3-2726";"The dead had risen at Tu'whacca's throne, but you returned them to their rest. Thank you."
"187173764-3-2764";"To think that necromancer at Tava's Blessing had such dark plans. Thank the gods you stopped him!"
"187173764-3-2989";"The nerve of the Imperials to attack Satakalaam! You gave them what they deserved!"
"187173764-3-3098";"Heard what you did at the at-Tura Estate. Tava bless you."
"187173764-3-3174";"I know you. You exposed the mad constable in Koeglin Village. Ruptga guide you!"
"187173764-3-3190";"I hear you resolved the standoff at Alcaire Castle. I am glad no blood was shed."
"187173764-3-3646";"Those witches helped at the Mill? That really surprises me."
"187173764-3-3648";"I heard that Duke Sebastien was ill, but Gloria Fausta cured him. Royalty have all the luck!"
"187173764-3-3656";"Did you hear what happened in Aldcroft? They killed the Duke."
"187173764-3-3676";"The Hag Fen is a strange place, even with the Wyresses watching over it."
"187173764-3-3692";"Turns out that Duke Sebastien's a werewolf, What a world we live in!"
"187173764-3-3925";"I hear someone helped the Wyrd Sisters save the Wyrd Tree."
"187173764-3-3956";"Glad to hear Camlorn is safe again. I imagine that it will take years to rebuild it, however."
"187173764-3-3968";"I heard you helped the soldiers camped at the Redoubt. Thank you for that."
"187173764-3-4056";"If I'd been in Crosswych, I'd have put my mining pick right into Sternes Gelves back."
"187173764-3-4111";"Tales of Angof's defeat by your hand have begun to spread. You're starting to make quite a name for yourself."
"187173764-3-4476";"Praise Vivec, you were there to stop Alexandra Conele from capturing the coral heart!"
"187173764-3-4481";"Davon's Watch would have been overrun if you hadn't been there."
"187173764-3-4508";"I would have enjoyed tangling with the Orcs at Malak's Maw. They're strong fighters. Almost as strong as Nords."
"187173764-3-4545";"Argonians in Silent Mire had a bit of pirate trouble recently, but I heard some stranger saved them."
"187173764-3-4561";"Good thing you stopped General Serien. Too bad about Tanval's son, though."
"187173764-3-4564";"You fought at Shinji's Scarp, huh? Heard that was quite a battle."
"187173764-3-4567";"Drathus told everyone who would listen how you discovered that spy."
"187173764-3-4595";"The Dark Elves sure like their kwama eggs. I think they taste terrible, but that's just my opinion."
"187173764-3-4600";"Plague in Narsis? Hah! Those Dark Elves wouldn't know a real plague if it crawled out and bit them."
"187173764-3-4642";"Nasty business in Stormhold. You must enjoy having the ear of the vicecanons."
"187173764-3-4652";"Anyone who has House Dres's respect has mine."
"187173764-3-4675";"Don't know why the Ashlanders attacked a holy order, but at least someone stopped them."
"187173764-3-4732";"Are you the one I should thank, for saving my home from Balreth?"
"187173764-3-4951";"The moment the plague disappeared from the Gorge, traders were selling their wares again. Amazing."
"187173764-3-4956";"I wonder what the Dominion thought when they saw you burn their ship."
"187173764-3-5037";"Deepcrag kwama mine had some trouble recently. I always wondered why they call it a mine? They just harvest eggs."
"187173764-3-5060";"The Ordinators seem on edge. What are the Dark Elves so nervous about?"
"187173764-3-5061";"Some of my Dark Elf friends are still upset that Saint Veloth's shrine was attacked. And by one of their own, no less."
"187173764-3-5077";"If you hadn't defeated that nasty little Elf, Vox, I'm sure our great King Jorunn would have taken care of her."
"187173764-3-5096";"I heard there's a crater in the middle of Selfora now and not much else."
"187173764-3-5131";"Is it true Tanval sacrificed himself to seal Sadal away?"
"187173764-3-5269";"Can you believe the Reachmen raised Sinmur's ghost? It's a good thing you were there."
"187173764-3-5359";"You're the hero who made Stral pay for the deaths of Dajaheel and Belron."
"187173764-3-5376";"I'm trying to compose a song about your heroics at Fallowstone Hall."
"187173764-3-5409";"This one is not sure what to think about a Redguard leading the Fighters Guild. Strange times we live in."
"187173764-3-5415";"Heard you wiped out that Goblin tribe in Fungal Grotto. Maybe I can go visit the place now."
"187173764-3-5429";"It's great to hear the Mages Guild have a new refuge for study and contemplation. Scholars should have a safe place to study, don't you think?"
"187173764-3-5483";"I heard that someone overthrew the giant leader in Lower Yorgrim."
"187173764-3-5504";"This one does not know what to think. A Khajiiti woman slain and a Daedra-worshipper advising the Fighters Guild? Strange times we live in."
"187173764-3-5509";"I love mead. I love Voljar mead. Well, really, I love any mead. I'm not that particular."
"187173764-3-5575";"You're the one that saved Jorunn the Skald-King in Windhelm. Hail, hero!"
"187173764-3-5602";"The rumor is that some stranger helped route the Stormfist Brigade from Fort Morvunskar."
"187173764-3-5613";"We Nords will route out that bastard Fildgor. He won't be able to hide in the hills for very long."
"187173764-3-5624";"Good riddance to those mad cultists and their Bad Man tree."
"187173764-3-5644";"This one doesn't grasp the Hound's goals, but thanks you for thwarting them."
"187173764-3-5650";"The Stormfist Brigade made a critical mistake at Cradlecrush. They should have left the mammoths alone."
"187173764-3-5701";"Rilis XII is an embarrassment and an abomination. You did well to destroy him."
"187173764-3-5719";"High-King Jorunn rules unopposed and Fildgor yet lives. The divines truely smile on the sons of Skyrim."
"187173764-3-5720";"I heard there was a fight at the entrance to Sovngarde. I wish I could have seen such a thing!"
"187173764-3-5734";"I'm starting to think the Skald-King is invincible. Not even poison can kill the smug bastard!"
"187173764-3-5736";"I presume it was quick for the Silvernar's advisor, in the end. You have my sympathies."
"187173764-3-5784";"You were at Faldar's Tooth, when Thallik tried to open a portal to Oblivion!"
"187173764-3-5789";"I'm glad you put an end to this Hound business. All Bosmer are in your debt."
"187173764-3-5865";"Maybe Jorunn deserved this fate. Maybe Fildgor was right all along. The Nord people must stand together."
"187173764-3-5935";"You're the favored one, the one Ysgramor appeared to."
"187173764-3-5955";"Good riddance to cowards. Captain Cularalda has no place in the Dominion!"
"187173764-3-6012";"You stood in the ruins of Ezduiin. The halls of the Ancients."
"187173764-3-6027";"Thank you for standing beside the Queen at Tanzelwil, traveler. Stars watch over you."
"187173764-3-6156";"You did us all a favor by saving Wayrest, but what were you doing down in those sewers?"
"187173764-3-6161";"Hail, Geirmund's Guardian!"
"187173764-3-6181";"Firsthold...so much death. I hear the place still smells of fire and death."
"187173764-3-6300";"I've heard tell of your devout work at the holy site of Torinaan. Divines bless you."
"187173764-3-6304";"You saved our high-and-mighty Queen, eh? Pah, Naemon should have had the crown!"
"187173764-3-6379";"Heard you found some witch raising Draugr in the Hall of the Dead. We live in dangerous times."
"187173764-3-6426";"There's the person that uncovered the plot against the King. Hail, hero!"
"187173764-3-6446";"Trusting a bandit? The Lion Guard should be ashamed of itself."
"187173764-3-6447";"You know what happened in Eagle's Brook? That's what happens when you rely on magic."
"187173764-3-6480";"Ayrenn should have been the one put to death at Skywatch. Bah!"
"187173764-3-6603";"Is it true? Did you really explore the Crypt of Hearts?"
"187173764-3-6654";"Bad enough to come to Coldharbour, but to end up in the Tower of Lies, toiling away? Glad some of those people were saved."
"187173764-3-6657";"The Jackdaws should never attacked Haven. They got what they deserved."
"187173764-3-6924";"You saw a spectral wolf that spoke like a man? Takes all kinds, I guess."
"187173764-3-6976";"Is it true you saved those priceless relics from the Worm Cultists in Rulanyil's Fall? What a brave gesture!"
"187173764-3-7019";"Champion of the Blessed Crucible, this one salutes you!"
"187173764-3-7209";"Lord Diel was talking about expanding the docks of Daggerfall to the north. Guess someone took care of those harpies."
"187173764-3-7211";"They say the storms from Tempest Island would've drowned and blasted us all, were it not for your heroics."
"187173764-3-7252";"My sister was among the soldiers you saved at Driladan Pass."
"187173764-3-7253";"So Diel messes with the harpies to try to turn a profit, and they find his body covered in claw marks? I'd call that justice."
"187173764-3-7280";"I can't imagine...all those people killed at Dune. Thank you, traveler."
"187173764-3-7400";"Now that the giant threat is over, I'm going to start trading in Lower Yorgrim again."
"187173764-3-7402";"I understand we've you to thank for uncovering the spy in Woodhearth."
"187173764-3-7424";"Now that Fildgor is gone, perhaps the Stormfist clan will accept with the one true king."
"187173764-3-7431";"I heard Ten-Maur-Wolk was full of Daedra. You're no milk-drinker, that's for sure."
"187173764-3-7434";"Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Scourge of Blackheart!"
"187173764-3-7524";"I heard a rumor that someone braved the Lightless Oubliette and saved the last Ayleid King."
"187173764-3-7536";"May Ruuvitar rot. Do we slaughter Dominion children in their cribs? It is not done!"
"187173764-3-7557";"The moors outside of Long Haven were home to vampires. Can you imagine!"
"187173764-3-7626";"I feel safer knowing that the Black Forge was destroyed."
"187173764-3-7656";"There's the hero who freed the researchers from the Library of Dusk. Well done, friend!"
"187173764-3-7709";"Hah, my brother was at your final match at Thizzrini! Well done!"
"187173764-3-7710";"You helped the Clanmother retake Arenthia! Bright moons and well done!"
"187173764-3-7804";"Valenwood still exists because you defeated the Veiled Heritance. I honor you."
"187173764-3-7876";"Taking the Chasm was necessary, but by the soul of Tu'whacca I would prefer never to have to fight over ground like that again."
"187173764-3-7915";"You are the Hallowed! Bright moons be praised!"
"187173764-3-7929";"The Hallowed that walked the Path. This one is not worthy to stand before you."
"187173764-3-8124";"I was beginning to think this fight was hopeless, but with the Great Shackle destroyed, we might just have a chance here."
"187173764-3-8125";"I was beginning to think this fight was hopeless, but with the Great Shackle destroyed, we might just have a chance here."
"187173764-3-8126";"I was beginning to think this fight was hopeless, but with the Great Shackle destroyed, we might just have a chance here."
"187173764-3-8127";"I was beginning to think this fight was hopeless, but with the Great Shackle destroyed, we might just have a chance here."
"187173764-3-8152";"Is it true that you faced Molag Bal himself? This one shivers just thinking about it."
"187173764-3-8178";"The Daedra opened a portal at Moonhenge, and some hero collapsed it single-handedly."
"187173764-3-8194";"A friend sailed on the Prowler when you defeated Vicereeve Pelidil. The stories he tells!"
"187173764-3-8199";"Argonians, exiled from the Gray Mire. Will the Dominion do so to Khajiit, one day?"
"187173764-3-8200";"I never thought I'd enjoy a stage magician before I went to Sarandel's Carnival."
"187173764-3-8275";"Truly the gods sent you here to save us from the Withered Hand...thank you!"
"187173764-3-8282";"I heard you fought beside the Champions at Grimwatch! By the Green!"
"187173764-3-8290";"This one thinks the Fighters Guild is confused...why let a Daedra-worshipper live? Yes?"
"187173764-3-8649";"Folks are saying that Count Ravenwatch discovered an Ayleid manuscript in the Lorkrata ruins. Good thing you were there to help him!"
"187173764-3-8686";"Blood is thicker than water. The queen's soft-hearted where her family's concerned, even when it's the Duke."
"187173764-3-8687";"I hear the Duke's gone. Good riddance! I never did trust him."
"187173764-3-8771";"We haven't had a real king since Ranser, and he was a little bit crazy. I hope our new ruler isn't quite as warlike as the last one."
"187173764-3-8786";"You kept the Falinesti Faithful safe in Grahtwood. I know a few. Good sorts."
"187173764-3-8800";"The Reachmen are off-guard. Something's gone wrong with their plans, it seems."
"187173764-3-8808";"They say the queen herself killed Duke Renchant. Good for her!"
"187173764-3-8882";"Shornhelm is safe, thanks to you! We'll make sure those Montclairs never come back!"
"187173764-3-8918";"I rejoice to know Bangkorai Garrison is under Covenant control once more."
"187173764-3-8940";"Those bastard Imperials killed my dog, so I took as many of their lives as I could. Now they'll fear the name Hallin's Stand."
"187173764-3-8947";"You aided Queen Ayrenn in her ratification, correct? You do look like someone to know."
"187173764-3-9040";"Will the High Elves build our embassy even uglier than theirs? But no, this one shouldn't complain."
"187173764-3-9125";"The Montclairs have been forced out of Northpoint. Thank you for fighting for us, friend."
"187173764-3-9144";"The Covenant's leader should've been King Fahara'jad. No one would dare attack him as they do King Emeric."
"187173764-3-9318";"Dathieu? The son of King Ranser's traitor general? Do we really want another Dathieu serving in the army?"
"187173764-3-9319";"Dathieu? The son of King Ranser's traitor general? Do we really want another Dathieu serving in the army?"
"187173764-3-9320";"Dathieu? The son of King Ranser's traitor general? Do we really want another Dathieu serving in the army?"
"187173764-3-9321";"Dathieu? The son of King Ranser's traitor general? Do we really want another Dathieu serving in the army?"
"187173764-3-9349";"You there! I saw you fighting at the Shrouded Pass. You were remarkable, if you don't mind me saying."
"187173764-3-9363";"I've heard of cold feet, but why would anyone open an Oblivion portal just to stop a wedding?"
"187173764-3-9369";"I've heard of cold feet, but why would anyone open an Oblivion portal just to stop a wedding?"
"187173764-3-9370";"I've heard of cold feet, but why would anyone open an Oblivion portal just to stop a wedding?"
"187173764-3-9371";"I've heard of cold feet, but why would anyone open an Oblivion portal just to stop a wedding?"
"187173764-4-5409";"A strong Redguard man leading the Fighters Guild! Tall Papa be praised, it is as it should be!"
"187173764-4-5429";"The spirit of Shalidor returned and advising the Mages Guild! The times we live in."
"187173764-4-5504";"I can't believe they're making Guildmaster at-Aswala listen to that Argonian scum. He should have killed her when he had the chance!"
"187173764-4-8290";"Guildmaster at-Aswala truly has the mercy of Tall Papa. He let that Argonian traitor leave the guild with her life!"
"187173764-5-5409";"About time there was a strong Redguard leading the Fighters Guild. He'll keep the outlanders in line!"
"187173764-5-5429";"The return of Arch-Mage Shalidor! Truly a reason for all sons of Skyrim to smile."
"187173764-5-5504";"The new Guildmaster was merciful to let that Argonian traitor stay in the Fighters Guild, don't you think?"
"187173764-5-8290";"That Argonian traitor should have been put to the blade. Guildmaster at-Aswala is kinder than I'd have been!"
