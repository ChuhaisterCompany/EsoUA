"15453358-0-18";"Time nearly disintegrated this book. I'm surprised the contents are still legible. We should handle this with care, the binding won't last much longer unless we take precautions."
"15453358-0-19";"Orcs of the past depicted historical figures in their armor. It's a practice we're only just now rediscovering. I'm sure the origins go back even farther, too. This was just the first one produced with some kind of consistency."
"15453358-0-20";"This book smells like some Orc stuffed it in his boot and kept it there for the last few centuries. Still, a good read."
"15453358-0-21";"If stories are to be believed, Torug gro-Igron loved bows and became proficient while hunting game. Most of the time he's depicted wielding dual axes, but that might be artistic interpretation."
"15453358-0-22";"Orcs are just rediscovering these kind of precise metalwork techniques. They were lost to us during the fall of Orsinium in 1E 980, and it is only by historical accounts such as these that we're able to reclaim them."
"15453358-0-23";"This book looks like it went through the jaws of a sabre cat and then came out the other end. A few of the words were hard to make out, but with a little effort you can parse it out."
"15453358-0-24";"There's an old folktale about a warrior named Urzatash the Bloody who picked a bar fight with the wrong Orc and got his face punched in. In the story, he has to live with a concave face for the rest of his life. Maybe it was based on some truth."
"15453358-0-25";"This is in great condition. Someone took great efforts to preserve this book. It looks as though there was a bit of restoration done to the inside binding but otherwise, this has all the original material."
"15453358-0-26";"The leather binding on this book is odd. It's soft, but hasn't completely disintegrated over time. Someone might have replaced it early on, or tried to pretty it up to make it part of a display."
"15453358-0-27";"Maces are an Orc favorite, always have been. The ones addressed in this book seem particularly brutal. Maces with pointed heads are an entirely different breed of weapon."
"15453358-0-28";"It's rare to find descriptions of Orc craftsmanship that include the word beautiful. The author seems to have great reverence for the detail found in the shields they describe."
"15453358-0-29";"This book looks ... flat. The text is still legible, but it looks like a mammoth stepped on it. The binding is crushed, the pages thinned, and the cover is almost comically stretched out."
"15453358-0-30";"I've never known an Orc to carry a staff that didn't look like it could double as a bludgeoning weapon if push came to shove. Even though many of these practices were lost to history, it seems as though instinct carried this one through to present day."
"15453358-0-31";"A good read. The author posits some theories that I've not heard debated, but perhaps they were at the time it was written. I don't think it matters nearly as much as the design itself. Note that Turog is featured once again here."
"15453358-0-32";"Despite Harald's desire for a uniform army in Skyrim, sagas from this period still revolve around grandiose warriors with storied weapons. Either exceptions were made for those who could provide their own equipment, or the skald took creative liberties."
"15453358-0-33";"The author omits the fact that insignias had to be approved by the king himself and were withheld from those who were in Harald's poor graces. Though this occasionally resulted in exacerbating feuds, the social pressure brought many rivals in line."
"15453358-0-34";"There are quite a few comedic works featuring a blustery, madcap brawler named Korm No-Toes. This is the first historic mention I've seen of him. Makes me wonder if some of his unlikely feats and misfortunes are based on true events."
"15453358-0-35";"Many of Skyrim's pre-Imperial forts were built during this period since the lack of infighting allowed for more substantial construction to proceed unmolested. Blocks were chiseled from catapult stone as they were whittling palisades down to arrows."
"15453358-0-36";"While minting the royal insignia in steel might appear to be a needless extravagance during a period of material shortages, Ugron assures me that the placement of the medallion is one of the most commonly struck locations on the body during a melee."
"15453358-0-37";"Perhaps it's due to their stature, but historically Nords do possess a predilection for enormity, whether it be for mugs, cheese wheels, mounts, daggers, or anything really. Not a people fond of half-measures. I can respect that."
"15453358-0-38";"I am told that some Nords also swore by using troll spit to enhance their grip in battle. I can't confirm this, but judging by the smell it might have been involved in the binding of this book."
"15453358-0-39";"Nord helmets in theatrical productions tend to be woefully inaccurate representations of their traditional designs, much to the chagrin of the Bards College."
"15453358-0-40";"Thankfully, Harald emphasized practicality, thus sparing the Nords from the same dark period of preposterously proportioned cod pieces found in High Rock around this time."
"15453358-0-41";"This movement toward common fittings didn't entirely carry on in the weaponsmithing trade, but was embraced by blacksmiths for the manufacture of common tools and hardware."
"15453358-0-42";"Eschewing the need for buoyancy made Nord heavy infantry second to none in their resilience, except arguably the Orcs. One account claimed that one of these shields could crumple an Elven cuirass with a full speed charge."
"15453358-0-43";"Imposing features are common in armor design. Imperial cuirasses have, at times, been molded into the shape of a powerful physique. Both the Aylieds and the Akaviri employed Daedra-like masks to inspire fear, with the former going so far as to wear wings."
"15453358-0-44";"It's unclear how commonly Nords employed magic in war. Clever Men and Women likely assumed advisory roles to rulers far more often than they were seen on the battlefield, but this does present evidence that such things occurred."
"15453358-0-45";"Swords are some of the most commonly found weapons from this period of Nord history, but it's unclear if that is due to their popularity or a large surplus that never saw battle in favor of some other instruments of death."
"15453358-0-46";"This book has some kind of material spread on it. It's almost waxy in appearance. It must have been some kind of resin to preserve the pages … and it seems to have done the job!"
"15453358-0-47";"I love the sass in this entry! I don't think it was necessarily meant to be funny, but the ""needlessly large buckle"" part made me laugh out loud!"
"15453358-0-48";"The leather on the binding of this book is hard as stone! I nearly dropped it and was terrified it would shatter into a thousand pieces! We should take extra care with this one."
"15453358-0-49";"This is an interesting read! It's as much a comment on the history of the time as well as an insight into what these Elves valued in their weaponry."
"15453358-0-50";"This book has a strange, golden hue to it. Or maybe I'm imagining things? There's a lot of golden imagery in this book, it made my heart all ... fluttery! I may have stared at this for a bit too long."
"15453358-0-51";"It makes me sad to see the state of this one. The pages are all torn up, the binding came unraveled and some of the ink is in danger of fading."
"15453358-0-52";"I would give anything to hear about the favored killing moves of the Elves that wore these gloves. How fascinating!"
"15453358-0-53";"It must have been so beautiful to see the sun gleaming off the eagle-like helms of this army. While reading this, I could picture it with such clarity! I wonder what that means …."
"15453358-0-54";"I think some heavy restoration went into this book. The binding certainly isn't the original material. Not that I'm complaining! At least the text is authentic, that's really the part that matters."
"15453358-0-55";"I think someone with a mace beat this book thoroughly before it came into our hands. This poor thing is so mangled it's barely legible!"
"15453358-0-56";"The author writes about felling enemies with such beautiful language. It practically reads like poetry! It must have been inspiring for the warriors reading it."
"15453358-0-57";"This book looks like it will crumble to dust at the slightest provocation. We should be extremely careful when handling it, if we need to handle it at all!"
"15453358-0-58";"I like to imagine myself as a smith during this time, following these directions. It must have been terrifying to try and make something to these grand specifications. The pressure is unimaginable!"
"15453358-0-59";"The ink in this book is remarkably well preserved. It almost looks as though someone just penned it moments ago! I wonder how it remained so well preserved."
"15453358-0-60";"Amazing! The craftsmanship of this metal spine allows it to move almost as well as an animal's spine. But, which animal? Pretty remarkable that a race that constantly recoiled from messy mortality used natural structures in their designs!"
"15453358-0-61";"Such a small conduit! It makes me think this belongs to an automata of some sort. Perhaps a vamidium? The metal features several reinforcing clamps. The Dwarves clearly designed this to withstand tremendous pressure."
"15453358-0-62";"These metal strips all curve inward from edges that clearly must attach to another component. Resembles a rib cage, I'd say. Probably built to protect vulnerable components while allowing access to talented architects."
"15453358-0-63";"A series of connected ebony plates and Dwarf-metal accents? It almost resembles the structure of a snake. I've heard tales of similar creatures in the Clockwork City. By Auri-El, if I ever make it to that place, I'll faint on the spot!"
"15453358-0-64";"Interesting. Traces of ebony make me think this cog was set within that type of metal. So, black and bronze? Someone was building for drama! You don't often see that kind of alloying in Dwarven work."
"15453358-0-65";"Given the size, these gears belong to something smaller than a Dwarven Centurion, but bigger than a Dwarven Sphere. How exciting! An as-yet unknown animunculus just waiting for assembly!"
"15453358-0-66";"These shafts connect to a frame. Is the Dwemeris inscription supposed to be instructions? They clearly socket into another segment of a larger machine. Something with multiple limbs by the looks of it."
"15453358-0-67";"This translucent stone makes a sound when properly placed in its setting. I can feel a bit of a zing when I touch it, so it has residual charge left. Extraordinary! I wonder what this relic empowers!"
"15453358-0-68";"Aha! This clearly belongs to a vamidium. I would say a quadruped. Perhaps a horse? The Dwemeris inscription appears much fiercer than the ones I've seen on other mechanical mounts. Could this object be a weapon of war?"
"15453358-0-69";"This handle clearly belongs to some sort of vamidium, but the ebony styling is unlike any I've seen before. I can scarcely imagine watching someone take that grip in hand and swing their leg astride a hissing steed!"
"15453358-0-70";"Hmm. Amalien can correct me if I'm wrong, but I definitely get the sense that these plates were meant to protect and reinforce a limb or other potential load-bearing element. They look quite sleek by Dwarven standards!"
"15453358-0-71";"Judging by the minor scrapes I see, these metal plates overlay each other, forming what might be a neck? Odd, considering Dwarves prided themselves on precision. Someone must have attempted to reassemble it, only to fail."
"15453358-0-72";"This plate clearly connects to a spinal and neck structure that holds inner workings of a vamidium's shoulder-machinery. It lacks some sort of stone, though. Perhaps a resonator sockets in there somehow."
"15453358-0-73";"Four limbs! Four! A quadruped! The shapes indicate a large dog or wolf, perhaps. Oh, but I shouldn't get my hopes up. Knowing my luck, they'll wind up belonging to some ugly, four-legged crab."
"15453358-0-74";"These are vamidium dog or wolf paws, which makes me wonder if Dwarves saw these creatures the same way Solitude's Nords see their silver wolves. Probably not. Of all the races of Tamriel, the Dwarves were the least sentimental."
"15453358-0-75";"Ah, precious aetherium! These gems might provide some form of vision, perhaps serving as lenses in a farseeing device? Certainly not meant for a person of Dwarven scale. These probably belonged to a vamidium or other large animunculus."
"15453358-0-76";"Ah. A wolf's head shaped in metal. For all their brooding and reclusiveness, it seems even Dwarves weren't immune to the dog's inherent charm! Everyone loves a loyal dog, right? Given the scale, this wolf almost certainly wants for a rider."
"15453358-0-77";"Map of the Direnni Hegemony, circa 1E 484. I note some discrepancies in the topography. There are some, shall we say, natural borders that don't align with the current lay of the land, or maps drawn a mere twenty years after."
"15453358-0-78";"This is an Orcish map. Hard to believe it's real. Hardly anything from the time of first Orsinium survived the war that broke it. This map outlines the territory claimed around the Bjoulsae River. There's a settlement marked: Golkarr."
"15453358-0-79";"An annotated draft of the political map of the kingdom of Rivenspire once belonging to the royal cartographer of Shornhelm. The lines have been redrawn numerous times in varying colors of ink. It seems the nobility was quite divided on the matter."
"15453358-0-80";"An Alik'r nomad tribe's map with a sparse frame of reference and no borders to speak of. Sentinel appears to be the only significant settlement of note. Instead, there is a focus on landmarks and hazards. A giant serpent's body is woven throughout."
"15453358-0-81";"I'd date this around the early to mid First Era. The kingdom of Ojwambu occupies the southern half of Bangkorai. It was sacked by the warlord Mahgzoor Rockhand, likely in retribution for driving the Goblins from their lands in Hammerfell."
"15453358-0-82";"Stonefall's early history is replete with tales of struggle and invasion. The borders shifted a lot during the Merethic and First Eras. This map displays a fleeting moment in time when ancient borders resembled those of the present day."
"15453358-0-83";"From the dark shading in the northern region, it seems likely this map dates to soon after the first eruption of Red Mountain. Sometime very soon after 1E 668. Deshaan experienced significant climate disruption during this period."
"15453358-0-84";"This is a treat! An Ayleid map of the Shadowfen region from very early in the First Era. The rendering of Stormhold looks almost aspirational. Several marks on here imply they had planned several locations for settlement."
"15453358-0-85";"Skyrim, the Old Holds. Eastmarch, specifically--the former heartland of the Nord Empire."
"15453358-0-86";"Oh, this seems to be a map of the Rift! It's hard to miss Lake Honrich and the Treva River. A much more temperate climate than the rest of Skyrim, really."
"15453358-0-87";"Oh! Clearly this is one of the Summerset Isles! Auridon, in fact. Nine Prows Landing is marked on it, too, which makes me think it's an early map."
"15453358-0-88";"Hmm, this is difficult to read, but I believe it's a map of the southeast Valenwood. This region is known as the Grahtwood, after the graht-oaks that are found in great numbers there."
"15453358-0-89";"This looks like southwestern Valenwood to me. Yes, this must be Greenshade."
"15453358-0-90";"An old depiction of Malabal Tor, the Bosmeri heartland. See, here's Silvenar, and over here is Falinesti--the summer site, I believe. Of course, no one's seen it in a very long time."
"15453358-0-91";"A map of the March. This land I know well. Bosmer, Khajiit, Colovians, and Imperials have fought over this place for centuries uncounted. The battles I could tell you of!"
"15453358-0-93";"An aged depiction of Wrothgar if my eyes aren't mistaken."
"15453358-0-94";"Vvardenfell's unique, volcanic geography makes Vvardenfell one of the most difficult places in Tamriel to map. The island's silhouette, however, is unmistakable."
"15453358-0-95";"I'd recognize this map anywhere. Home. Summerset Isle. This map is old, but it's not too old. I've seen maps drafted by the Aldmer, and honestly, the landmarks are barely recognizable."
"15453358-0-96";"Difficult to say with certainty since its shores change so often, but I'm fairly confident this map depicts southern Black Marsh. Specifically the Murkmire region."
"15453358-0-97";"Ah! Hard to mistake this map, given the recent troubles in the region. It's Anequina sure enough. Northern Elsweyr, I mean."
"15453358-0-98";"Ah, the wonders of Pellitine committed to history in genuine Elsweyr ink! Just glorious!"
"15453358-0-99";"You can tell from the grain pattern here, the person who made this repurposed wood from another object. These minor warps make it no less beautiful. Hard to believe, given its finish, but I think this box used to be part of a ship."
"15453358-0-100";"Much of the imagery from the Aldmer carried over into the descending cultures, like the High Elves. Amalien knows how fond her people are of aquiline imagery. That might explain the bird figurine. The Magnus connection is a bit puzzling, though."
"15453358-0-101";"Despite the object's age, the miniscule aspects of this music box seem to be in perfect working order. We should take care when handling it, though. Amalien, please resist the urge to take it apart."
"15453358-0-102";"An ancient dance, eh? Judging by the spacing and the painstaking notation, it's definitely a High Elf creation. Ugh. We're so stuffy! Remind me to show you some real dancing once I grease the rear axle of my chair!"
"15453358-0-104";"When Ysgramor set sail from Atmora to avenge the Night of Tears, he sent out a call for warriors to join him. Those who answered his call won everlasting renown as the Five Hundred Companions. One of those mighty heroes likely wore this very headpiece!"
"15453358-0-105";"The skalds say that Ysgramor and his companions were the first to wear the blue war-paint so many Nords still favor today. Supposedly Ysgramor slew so many frost giants that he was covered in their blue blood. The rest of his foes fled the field!"
"15453358-0-106";"An important discovery! No one remembered what markings Ysgramor and his Five Hundred Companions wore on their faces. The spiral designs are symbols of death. The Atmorans wore them to show that they sought a glorious end in battle!"
"15453358-0-107";"An excellent example of Dwemer craftsmanship. The geometric etchings likely symbolize wisdom and authority; the white stones, nobility. This crown would have been worn by a Dwarven architect or other high ranking artisan."
"15453358-0-108";"I love the Dwarves dearly, but the word narcissistic hardly captures the brazen vanity of their culture. They adorned practically everything with stylized faces that presumably match their own. This vivid tattoo follows that theme brilliantly."
"15453358-0-109";"A simple design, but one imbued with great symbolic importance. We rarely find a Dwarven pillar, forge, or animunculus that lacks a bearded face. I think we can safely infer that such facial ornamentation conveyed a sense of skill, wisdom, or authority."
"15453358-0-111";"The Sea of Pearls is known for the myriad shells that wash up on its islands' shores. Many of them have whorls consistent with nautilus shells, which tend to be lightweight but incredibly durable."
"15453358-0-112";"I'm not exactly an expert on the Sload, or anemones for that matter, but I know swamp anemones tend to grow in brackish areas. Much like the swampy region in the center of the Thrassian Archipelago, where I imagine these are from."
"15453358-0-113";"I've read that dense corals provided the entire foundation of Thras. They probably mined it in much the same way we mine iron and stone, right?"
"15453358-0-114";"Do you think this was made out of Sload themselves? I think it could be harvested without killing the creature, but I imagine it would painful. Like flaying."
"15453358-0-115";"Was there any metal in Thras? If not, I'm curious how this metal came into their possession. It's not as if they had a flourishing trade relationship with the peoples of Tamriel."
"15453358-0-116";"Over the years, many artists have imagined Snow Elf attire as being made of fashionable furs from head to toe. Long fur capes, decorative hats, fluffy boots …. The stitching on the sides suggests these were made for clothes."
"15453358-0-117";"Snow-cedar is incredibly durable. The Snow Elves apparently bred them to be able to withstand intense cold and lack of nutrients, but I've never seen parts of one separated from the living tree before!"
"15453358-0-118";"These carvings appear to venerate Auri-El. My research indicates he occupied a place of special significance for Snow Elves. This metal is quite flexible, too. I'm not sure what the original purpose of this was."
"15453358-0-119";"These are inert now, but I see evidence of magicka smelted into the metal itself. The scorch marks suggest it was fire magic, or at least a very mild form of it. These marks are from use, not from a singular blast of heat."
"15453358-0-120";"These are incredibly small. The detail is astounding! I can't even begin to speculate what these might have held together. To be honest, we rarely see such fasteners in Elven apparel. They appear almost Dwarven in their construction."
"15453358-0-121";"The charm itself is small, but it certainly resembles other depictions of Y'ffre—the Forest god of the Wood Elves. Given these hollows on either side of his head, I'd say this is part of a series of charms."
"15453358-0-122";"Some folk might look at this monstrous thing and think Maormer, but it's Wild Hunt imagery, to be sure. Apparently, Wood Elves can shift into all manner of hideous beast during a Wild Hunt. This one seems part snake, part fish?"
"15453358-0-123";"Too small to be a ring. It almost looks like a ring's ring, as odd as that sounds. It seems like it's made from the same material as the other charms from the area. Does this have anything to do with the Wild Hunt?"
"15453358-0-124";"A small carving, but nonetheless haunting. This thing is pretty monstrous, but I'm not even sure what kind of monster you'd qualify it as. Too creepy not to be related to the Wild Hunt, right?"
"15453358-0-125";"I'll be honest ... I don't really know what I'm looking at here. I suppose it could be a face? If you squint? Given the bizarre shape and the greenish hue of the metal, I'd say this is a relic of the Wild Hunt."
"15453358-0-126";"Unusual--this metal band is about the size of a neck-ring, but I have a sense that it's incomplete.  Dwarven work, for sure; the geometric design is quite common in Dwemer artifice. If it's a torc, where's the rest of it?"
"15453358-0-127";"These clean notches--I recognize them. They're Dwemer symbols for sound or song. As many of you know, sound played an essential role in Dwarven life and magical praxis. I often wonder if that included singing."
"15453358-0-128";"A twisted strand of Dwarven metal, marked with Dwemer notches signifying power. By itself, the piece has no purpose. But joined with other pieces--braided together into a neck-ring, perhaps--this strand would vastly boost the strength of the whole."
"15453358-0-129";"Strange; I've never encountered a Dwemer torc equipped with these shield-like extensions. Designed to amplify the voice, perhaps? Or to protect the wearer's throat from harm? To what purpose? An armored gorget would seem more practical."
"15453358-0-130";"Quartz, common, shaped with no great skill or design. Considering the workmanship of the other pieces that make up this magical torc, I must wonder if the original focusing stone was replaced with an inferior one by some lesser artisan."
"15453358-0-131";"An outstanding find! See the intricacy of the twisted knots? This is clearly the upper hoop of one of Malacath's Brutal Bands! With the hoop, the core, and the loop, it forms a perfect ring."
"15453358-0-132";"Look, a piece of Malacath's Brutal Band! This is obviously from a ring that belonged to a prominent member of Malacath's Brutal Breed, a cult that rose from the ashes of Orsinium around 1E 1000. A fascinating group!"
"15453358-0-133";"This ritual urn bears the mark of the Brutal Breed. An Orc named Borug gro-Bashnarz founded the cult and served as its head supplicant. Legends attribute him as the one who received the Brutal Bands from Malacath himself. Hard to believe, even for an Orc."
"15453358-0-134";"Another amazing find! This can only be the core of one of Malacath's Brutal Bands. Notice the intricate carving, the runework. The cult claimed the rings were forged in the Ashpit and presented to them by Malacath himself."
"15453358-0-135";"A pouch of ritual dust associated with the cult known as Malacath's Brutal Breed. A wonder it survived. It truly is well preserved. Must have something to do with how the leather was treated. Or maybe it really contains dust from the Ashpit?"
"15453358-0-136";"At first blush, there was nothing exceptional about this plain, leather belt, but its appearance is deceiving. There are hollow channels beneath the surface that I can only describe as veiny and the inside of the loop is studded with teeth!"
"15453358-0-137";"I don't recognize the style of this doublet. Probably a bespoke piece commissioned by a wealthy patron. The suppleness of the leather is beyond exquisite. It doesn't creak when stretching and snaps back elastically. Wearing it is like a warm hug."
"15453358-0-138";"Typically, a gorget would sit closer to the throat and fully encompass the neck. This wide scoop would offer limited protection from anything other than arrows deflected upward after striking the carapace. It would provide ample room for a bulky helmet."
"15453358-0-139";"Unusual design. The spine and chest are heavily reinforced from the front and rear, but the flanks and abdomen are completely exposed. The benefit to mobility would hardly outweigh the sacrifice in protection. Thick spikes appear entirely aesthetic."
"15453358-0-140";"This is a strange, hybrid design. Normally an encompassing piece like this would strap under the ribcage to protect the abdomen and extend down past the legs. This does neither, offering coverage to the kidneys, hips, pelvis, and little else."
"15453358-0-141";"How odd. This figure of an Elven woman bears hallmarks of Aldmeri depictions of Mara, but it's too rudimentary. Was it the work of a child? Maybe it was unfinished."
"15453358-0-142";"I'm intrigued by the religious overtones in this depiction of Rislav smiting his brother Dorald. I'd always assumed the appellation ""Rislav the Righteous"" was ascribed to him by historians, but this panel dates to the time of his rule."
"15453358-0-143";"Direnni scholars have long held the belief that Prince Aiden's brilliance as a strategist was what carried the day for his vastly outnumbered forces, but a controversial theory speculates that the Direnni army's movements on the battlefield bordered on prophetic and attributes their success to superior methods of communication. The enchantments on this case suggest it is an anchor for some form of teleportation. If only I had another to test the idea."
"15453358-0-144";"Unfinished wood block, stained black with ink. Circa 2300 of the First Era. Took a rubbing of the carved face. It is a diatribe calling citizens of Wayrest to demand secession from the Alessian Empire, citing prejudice against Elven heritage."
"15453358-0-145";"This wooden figure appears to be an Orc, but its features are greatly exaggerated to appear menacing. Based on the deliberate defacement and hostile appearance, I believe the Nedes did not have a friendly relationship with local Orc clans."
"15453358-0-146";"A palatial portrait of the Direnni royal family! This likely would have hung in the halls of the Adamantine Tower at the heights of their rule. I'd love to know more of who's depicted here, but there's a lack of distinguishing features. In fact, the family resemblance borders on simulacra. It's hard to believe a royal artist would be so lazy. Though, despite mingling with Nedes, only pureblooded Direnni rose to power. That would mean ... ew, no. Maybe they really did reproduce through sorcery?"
"15453358-0-147";"It's remarkable how little the Tamrith house seal has changed over the course of centuries. It makes this hard to date, but it's real and it's old. Impressive, since these were widely counterfeited during King Ranser's war to falsify correspondence."
"15453358-0-148";"Now these are quite hard to come by. Yric Flowdys had these gold coins specially minted to commemorate the completion of Northpoint's construction in c.1E 900. Only a few hundred were stamped and most remain in private collections."
"15453358-0-149";"It's so rare to find Ayleid architectural art still intact! The Alessian Order took a special glee in wiping out Elven culture. I think the only reason there's any left at all was because they were more interested in wiping out the Elves themselves. This beautiful relief pictures the legendary Spire of Erokii while it still stood. Now the inglorious ruins are simply known as Doomcrag. One day I'll convince someone to carry me to the summit to study the spire's remains."
"15453358-0-150";"The tip of this spade-shaped tool forks like the tongue of a serpent, but the only sharpened edge sits along a slot at the base, facing the handle. I can't help but liken it to the cheese servers of Wayrest, but religious engravings suggest otherwise."
"15453358-0-151";"What exquisite steel. Dark whorls of gray flow through a sea of silver like the Ra Gada themselves. I've seen the stylistic elements etched in this metal worn by members of the Crowns in Sentinel, but this nominal gauntlet is clearly ceremonial."
"15453358-0-152";"I'm amazed this glass rod has survived intact for thousands of years. It's light as a feather and remarkably hard, thanks to the magicka still clinging to it. It vibrates when stuck into sand. After some experimenting, I determined the intensity would rise and fall in proximity to water. Ancient Elves must have used these to travel safely across the Alik'r Desert. Well, as safely as would be possible, there would still need to be water within a half-day's travel for this to detect it."
"15453358-0-153";"What could rightly be confused for an ugly, ruddy gemstone appears to be a lacquered clod of reddish-brown dirt. The insignia of the Knights of St. Pelin is pressed into the surface. This could be a relic of the late Pelin's martyrdom."
"15453358-0-154";"This tree root has been shaped, by unconventional means, into the appearance of a woman with stag horns and cloven feet. The wood is unmarred by tool marks and the bark remains intact. This was likely a work of magic by a local wyrd."
"15453358-0-155";"For such a far flung and advanced civilization, we know very little about Dwemer daily life. While they were notoriously reclusive, it's presumed that they engaged in some form of commerce, if only with each other. This bar of Dwarven metal is more than a simple ingot. It has a band of beautiful blue crystal through it with the name Arkngthamz-Phng inlaid and a series of Dwarven numerals. These could represent the volume, or weight, or identifier, or its harmonic resonance, or even a secret code!"
"15453358-0-156";"A bit rusty, but still in good condition. Late First-Era by the look of it. These appear to be modeled after the designs of the Dwemer observatory found on Stros M'kai. The Hunding name is inscribed, but this device is far younger than that bloodline."
"15453358-0-157";"It resembles a tiny waterwheel made from iron and the flexible bark of tropical trees. It would have crumbled to dust long ago if not for a thick grease smeared over everything. It looks just the right size to fit on the end of a Dwemer steam pipe!"
"15453358-0-158";"I first thought all the divots on these Dwarven metal plates to be more of their typically abstract art or the result of some sort of projectile testing, but I finally figured it out! They're plots of stars in the night sky! I was thrown off by the sheer volume of points on each plate compared to what I can observe by the naked eye. Perhaps their observatory is powerful enough to peer through to Aetherius itself? Could it have guided the Dwemer there and that's why they left Tamriel behind?"
"15453358-0-159";"Sapping tools from the Seamount clan's conquest of Betnikh, formerly Betony. Contrary to claims by the current chief, Stonetooth Fortress was likely built on the bones of Breton defenses. This chisel could split a keystone if properly applied."
"15453358-0-160";"This spherical stone eye has numerous winding tendrils curving out from its surface. I've counted them eight times and gotten eight different results. It does faintly emit a Daedric energy, but there's no enchantment that would alter its shape."
"15453358-0-161";"This lends a shred of credence to the so-called Almanac of Betony as more than florid Breton embellishment. While I've seen little evidence of an impregnable fortress carved from this island's imposing cliffs, this foundation block proves the Empire did construct fortifications here during Reman II's reign. If Skyspire Keep did exist, it was likely constructed according to conventional legion codices. I suspect most of the keep's stone was used to create Stonetooth Fortress."
"15453358-0-162";"While certainly brittle from lack of care over the centuries, I'm impressed by how well the skin held together. The Nedes were accomplished leatherworkers, perhaps due to a nomadic nature. Though I'm curious about the quality of their wine."
"15453358-0-163";"A delightful instrument. This is Nord made, probably from a mammoth tusk considering the size. The bronze bands are scuffed and without decoration, suggesting this was a practical item and not decorative."
"15453358-0-164";"Chimer military insignia stand out as unique among Mer since their designs didn't incorporate House sigils. Nonetheless, I can determine this belonged to the legendary General Balreth by the striking flourishes of color that signify unparalleled honors. I must admit to feeling some sadness while holding these badges. Balreth sacrificed everything to protect his people from the Nede hoard. These represent the last remnants of his life before his transformation."
"15453358-0-165";"The bronze work and distinct etched patterns point to a First Era Dunmer creation. I'd guess the three prominent figures on its base almost confirm it. But its spiraling snake design is unlike any I've seen from the Dark Elves."
"15453358-0-166";"Such a grotesque visage. The sharp features resemble a Mer, and the crude leather-wrapped wood construction suggest Ashlander work. I don't recognize the syntax of the Daedric script on the forehead. Clearly, this is more than a simple war mask."
"15453358-0-167";"At first I wondered why this specific slice of Tamriel would be painted in such detail. With Gabrielle's help, I discovered someone magically marked a trail on it from Summerset to Morrowind. This could be the precise path that Saint Veloth himself walked on his pilgrimage! Such fortune that some early Dunmer used linen instead of parchment or it may not have survived the centuries. We placed it in a stasis spell to prevent further degradation, which sadly means no one may touch it."
"15453358-0-168";"How adorable! The doll resembles the mysterious Hist trees found in Black Marsh. Don't dolls usually look like the children they're intended for? Perhaps this is hard evidence that Argonian children start off as Hist saplings?"
"15453358-0-169";"At first glance, I thought this was an oversized coin. Clavicus Vile's unmistakable image often appears on early currency intended as an offering to the Daedra. But the hinged clasp shows it was meant to be worn. What is this other figure here?"
"15453358-0-170";"A most curious scroll case. One single piece of carved onyx with no apparent way of opening the cylinder to remove its contents. Sigils etched in silver suggest some connection to ancient Argonian royalty. The few texts we have about Shadowscale mention a protection compact for the old rulers. Such an ornate case could indeed carry such a document. I won't destroy such a unique case, but I see no other way of getting inside."
"15453358-0-171";"The runes marked on these small bones can predict the future, if you know how to read them. The augur shakes them up in a bag, then pours them out on the ground, looking for alignments and connections. Casting the runes is a rare talent!"
"15453358-0-172";"Now here's something I didn't expect to find in Skyrim: a lord's banner from distant Akavir. Leaders in Akaviri armies fastened these banners to the back of their armor so their soldiers could easily identify them in the thick of the fight."
"15453358-0-173";"Oh, that's immense! The sheer size of the piece makes it clear: this headdress belonged to a Giant … and not just any Giant. Here we see unusually deft workmanship and ornamentation for a Giantish artifact. These tusk-like horns are shaped from mammoth ivory, and the prongs securing them in place are made of hammered gold. Only a Giant of great importance—a high chieftain such as the legendary Sinmur, say—would claim authority over their fellows by wearing anything like a crown!"
"15453358-0-174";"A decorative shield boss, Nordic, mid-4th century First Era. Nord shields grew larger over time in the later years of the Nordic Empire, and accomplished warriors began to adorn the center boss with scrollwork and natural designs."
"15453358-0-175";"This is unusual. One might attribute it to Haafingar heraldry, but I think it's far older than Solitude's standard. In the Old Way of the Nords, the She-Wolf embodied commitment and fertility; I suspect this brooch belonged to ancient sword-maiden."
"15453358-0-176";"No common warrior could afford a sword-hilt of mammoth ivory. The Dragon-head motif also marks this as the heirloom of a royal line. The metal here is bronze, not gold—a weapon of war, not a lord's decoration. This, then, is what's left of a battle-sword belonging to a Nord king or prince from the time of the Ysgramor Dynasty. I wish I could have seen the blade itself. It must have been marvelous. By Nord standards, at least."
"15453358-0-177";"A longship's steering oar, early 2E 1st century. This one belonged to a successful raiding captain, I think. The runes spell out boasts about the plunder they took during each of the captain's voyages."
"15453358-0-178";"Here's a real find! This was a Dragon Cult mask. Dragon Priests believed that they became living vessels of their Dragon-gods' spirits and spoke with divine authority when they donned these masks. An oaken one like this probably belonged to lesser clergy."
"15453358-0-179";"What have we here? The old sagas of the proto-Nords describe glass-like sunstones that allowed a longship captain to see the sun's location even on a cloudy day, but their secret was lost long ago. Yet here we have a stone as clear as glass--just as the legends claim. The mighty Ysgramor himself was said to have used a stone such as this in his voyages! And these runes inscribed around the stone's perimeter identify it as a gift of great favor from a Nord High King. Truly, a remarkable find!"
"15453358-0-180";"A traditional Dematah gaming set, eh? Incomplete, but still lovely. Basalt is a rather heavy and coarse stone for delicate work such as this, but the carver chose a deliberately abstract style for the pieces. Not uncommon in early Dunmer craftsmanship."
"15453358-0-181";"A sinister motif rendered in such a lovely medium! The chalice is exquisite, as you can see; Dunmeri work of the highest quality. But if you look closely at these figures depicted around the base, you can see the collars and chains. They're slaves."
"15453358-0-182";"A rare find. The ring bears two emblems: one Dwemeri, one Chimeri. This, then, is a token of high office from the short-lived peace of Resdayn, in the days of the First Council. Lord Indoril Nerevar and the Dwarf-King Dumac ruled jointly and wisely … for a time. Soon enough Dwemer and Chimer turned against each other in a bitter war, to no one's surprise. Ah, well. The size of this signet and the royal flourishes show that this ring belonged to a high councilor of the realm."
"15453358-0-183";"Well, this is an easy one: the token itself proclaims it to be from the Festival of Defiance, which clearly references Skywatch's celebration of freedom from the Sload."
"15453358-0-184";"The scales on this snake pipe possess so much detail, but who would want to press their lips to it, unless … Maormer? That explains the shape—a snake—but what kind? The blue and green bands shift into each other hypnotically. Does it charm people?"
"15453358-0-185";"I can't overstate the magnitude of this discovery. An aetherquartz sphere like this--also known as a calian--is the physical embodiment of a High Elf's honor and status in the High Elf community. I keep mine in a small willow wood box, but it's a fraction of the size and it's completely transparent. Whoever created this one managed to embed a translucent eagle in the rose-colored glass! This had to belong to a Grand Athelan or similarly important religious figure. Marvelous!"
"15453358-0-186";"Wood Elf work, this. The horn is made from the end of a timber-mammoth tusk, and the mouth-piece is carved bone. The inscribed image depicts a hunting scene, of course. Likely the owner sounded it to mark the start of the chase."
"15453358-0-187";"Interesting. This gold statuette appears to be a representation of the Daedric Prince Meridia--the personification of the element of light, at least to the Ayleids. A small sculpture such as this probably resided in a noble's house shrine."
"15453358-0-188";"Don't be deceived by the common materials of this headpiece—it's a Wood Elf treasure. This is a crown of the Camoran Dynasty, rulers of the ""walking city"" of Falinesti. From season to season the great Elden Tree moves to different sites within the Valenwood, although no one seems to have seen it in some time. Naturally, the Wood Elf monarchs had a different crown for each of Falinesti's seasons. This is a winter crown, which would have been worn when Falinesti took its rest in Grahtwood."
"15453358-0-189";"This looks Ayleid, and given the area it was found, it makes sense. Though, there are a few Bosmer touches to the design that make me think this was some kind of collaboration."
"15453358-0-190";"I've never seen a Bosmer sigil like this. It seems like a mark of protection made with graht-oak, but it looks sinister in nature, as though whatever it was protecting the wearer from was a great evil. This would have been worn with serious intent."
"15453358-0-191";"There are a great many tales about the Eldest and the pilgrims of Valenwood. One describes a mother and her young daughter seeking refuge in the Den of the Eldest. As promised, the mother bequeaths her firstborn to the Eldest in exchange for wisdom. It is said that the daughter stays there for many years until she is a woman grown. She buries her childhood shoes in the soil in hopes they will help the Eldest grow. Could the tales be true? Are these the shoes of the girl raised by the Eldest?"
"15453358-0-192";"Wood elf priests have venerated Y'ffre through song and story since time immemorial. The images inscribed on this bone illustrate an ancient Bosmer tale--and the hollowed-out bone can be played like an instrument, a traditional accompaniment."
"15453358-0-193";"This is no Bosmeri work. See, the scabbard is made of thin wood staves beneath the fine leather, and the gemstones are precisely faceted in a style commonly found in Ayleid jewelry. Not very practical for a weapon of war."
"15453358-0-194";"Throughout the centuries, the Silvenars of the Bosmer have worn no special badge of office; every Wood Elf of the Valenwood knows the Silvenar on sight. But from time to time, Silvenars find it useful to carry some token of authority that outsiders can easily recognize. The extravagant carving of this bone scepter shows that a Wood Elf artisan crafted this to impress foreigners. The leaves in the scrollwork are actually stranglers--a subtle warning, it would seem.  A truly unique find."
"15453358-0-195";"Khajiiti work, for certain--brass, with silver filigree. This is a temple censer, used to burn aromatic incense pleasing to the divinity or spirit being honored. The figures in the decorative scrollwork appear to be priests greeting the moons."
"15453358-0-196";"A Khajiiti djerid, 1E, twelfth or thirteen century. It's a hunting dart--more of a small javelin, really. This one is noteworthy for the exceptional decorative carving of the shaft and the colorful streamers affixed just behind the barbed head."
"15453358-0-197";"Incredible! This is the ceremonial headdress of an ancient Mane of the Khajiit. Each single braid comes from a highly honored Khajiit warrior or clan-mother; when the Mane put on this crown, he figuratively donned the strength and wisdom of an entire people. Pity that some of the hair is lost, and the silver clasps have dulled somewhat. Still, it's astonishingly well preserved! A rare find, indeed!"
"15453358-0-198";"A beautiful piece. Someone very meticuously carved this to resemble a winged-cat, but still took the time to make it a functioning pipe, though it's thicker than most modern ones."
"15453358-0-199";"Despite its age, this design doesn't look too different from modern day fishing rods. The embellishments are certainly unique, though. A lot of Khenarthi specific imagery. I doubt the additional weight made it any easier to fish."
"15453358-0-200";"Pilazjo was a legendary Khenarthian Rawlith Khaj master who trained from an early age on the Isle of Three Temples. A jealous king traded him to Ne Quin-al as part of a pact of friendship between their two kingdoms. Common practice at the time, but very difficult for Pilazjo himself. The warrior left a collection of blunted training swords in his home adeptorium as a reminder to the hadaliit he left behind. These swords became precious heirlooms—locked away in adeptoriums throughout Elsweyr."
"15453358-0-204";"This is incredible! Dark and horrible, of course, but still incredible! Given the markings, this could have been part of a torture rack within Heart's Grief itself."
"15453358-0-205";"Strange. These are magically inert and without mechanical locks, leading me to believe they were ensorcelled shackles. They're also quite fashionable, don't you think? If I had to be imprisoned I wouldn't be too unhappy about these. Any thoughts?"
"15453358-0-206";"Torture devices recovered from Coldharbour aren't unexpected. To find one so well preserved, however, is exciting. But that's not the most astounding part about this piece. It's what's inside that really boggles the mind. (Nothing gruesome, don't worry, Amalien). It seems to be a scrap of regalia, one that would only be found on the uniforms of commanding officers aboard the All Flags Navy. Perhaps one of the captains that was brought into Coldharbour was tortured in this device. Ghastly."
"15453358-0-207";"Looks Nedic to me. The stitching makes it irrefutable. The design suggests whoever wore this was important, in a position of power or worship. Maybe it belonged to a member of the Perena's clergy?"
"15453358-0-208";"There doesn't look to be anything inherently magical about this, but this is no ordinary piece of jewelry. If I had to guess, I'd say it's Nedic. The serpent cradling the stone seems reminiscent of the ones I've seen in Craglorn's ruins."
"15453358-0-209";"Mamireh, Akamon, Roshadon, and Rok'dun the Flame, referred to as the Four, were among the most prominent Yokudan warriors of the first invasion of the Nedic homelands. They were Ansei of the first rank, of course, and before undergoing initiation they were required to give up their most treasured weapons. Supposedly, Akamon's sandal-bearer carried the shards of his master's first dagger as a daily reminder of his sacrifice."
"15453358-0-213";"The face is worn off which makes it difficult to determine who the artist was attempting to depict. Given that it came from Wrothgar, it might be some totem or figure from the first Orcs? Ugron can shed some light on it this, I'm sure."
"15453358-0-214";"Judging by rugged styling and extreme aging, I'd pin this as early First Era. Definitely Orcish, but I'm not sure if any of it is distinctive enough to determine which area it's from, or which clan. It is quite large, even by Orc standards."
"15453358-0-215";"Much of the archeological evidence of the first Orsinium vanished during the thirty-year siege, but this looks like a relic of Chieftain Torug gro-Igron to me. Torug died long before the siege began, but I've read numerous accounts describing a bell he erected in the gathering-place of that first modest village that eventually became Orsinium. The chief rang this bell to gather the clan for fellowship at first. Later, they rang it to gather the clan for war."
"15453358-0-216";"What an incredible piece! I'm sure the lion hair was incredibly expensive, especially at the time. This probably belonged to one of the powerful merchant families of Hew's Bane. Maybe a symbol of their power passed down through generations!"
"15453358-0-217";"More snakes! Honestly, it seems like they appear in every corner of Tamriel! I don't recognize the aesthetic here. It certainly isn't Yokudan. The locking mechanism seems quite sophisticated, though."
"15453358-0-218";"You may have discovered the spoils of the fledgling Thieves Guild's first heist in Abah's Landing! Few families could match the power of the Vadaya family during the high days of merchant rule. Lady Vadaya commissioned an elaborate portrait of herself, only to have it stolen out from under her nose and replaced with a fake. Unwilling to lose face, the Vadayas accused the rival Mizh family of orchestrating the theft, pitting the two houses against one another to this very day."
"15453358-0-219";"Here's a pretty thing. This resembles the rings one might find in the nose of an unruly bull. Far more ornate, though. Much larger, too. This is an odd discovery. The rocky terrain around Kvatch is better suited for goats than cattle."
"15453358-0-220";"According to Imperial histories, Anvil enjoyed a rich statuary tradition in the early years of the First Empire--before the Alessian Order made such artistic expression more difficult. This face appears very eroded, though."
"15453358-0-221";"We've stumbled upon something truly dangerous here. The cover should serve as your first clue; black leather that seems to shiver into goosebumps at the slightest touch. And the contents are no better. Page after blood-stained page depicting murders of every variety. What I find most disturbing is this ""Rite of Penance."" It's not like the Black Sacrament. The sigils and physical components feel consistent with a summoning ritual. But what could an assassin summon that's worse than himself?"
"15453358-0-222";"This definitely seems Dwemeric in origin, but it's not something I recognize. As you all know, discerning the function of Dwarven machines is thirsty work. It looks like someone repurposed it, though. Some ancient scavenger, perhaps."
"15453358-0-223";"Not really sure what I'm looking at here. Seems like some kind of rough-forged grappling hook, but judging by the size, it could probably bear a mammoth's weight."
"15453358-0-224";"Tribunal priests and religious enforcers make it very difficult to learn much about the mysterious Sixth House. From what little information we can find, this noble house played a major role in the War of the First Council between the Chimer and the Dwarves. Always a secretive group, House Dagoth deployed these strange, beetle-shaped locks on their doors to taste the blood of those who sought entry--a valuable precaution in wartime, and consistent with the Dark Elves' inherent wariness."
"15453358-0-225";"For once in my august career, I am at a loss. This object clearly performs some vital function in Sotha Sil's secret lair. Beyond that, I have no idea. I hope you won't try to regale me with tales of his fanciful ""clockwork kingdom."" It's preposterous."
"15453358-0-226";"Some kind of religious scourge. Used for self-flagellation no doubt. Mauloch's jawbone, this tool is ancient. The Daedric script here--see how it gives way to these more geometric runes? What were these Dark Elves punishing themselves for?"
"15453358-0-227";"Is this a pot? Or a vase? Or an urn of some kind? I've never seen such an oddly shaped vessel. It appears to be made of some strange, striated stone. Something artificial no doubt. It's almost like the craftsman built it in layers—one on top of the other. And what's inside? Roland's Tear flowers, perfectly preserved. And a note, as well? It simply says, ""Forgive me."" How perplexing. Nonetheless, this would likely fetch a king's ransom in a Vvardenfell auction house. Quite a find!"
"15453358-0-228";"Can't say as I've ever seen an object like this in Summerset. Everything there is so pristine. This vessel appears misshapen and cheap. Even so, the glass appears almost iridescent. Why would someone use such beautiful materials for something so hideous?"
"15453358-0-229";"This appears to be an ancient badge of office. And what's this symbol? A great eye with three ebony pupils floating in a viridian iris. I suppose it could be literal. What creature in Summerset has three eyes?"
"15453358-0-230";"I can scarcely believe it. This is a genuine kinlord's tree! This grand document details the bloodline of a High Elf calan, all the way back to the first Aldmer ancestor who stepped foot on Tamriel's shores! Notice the Jephrine motifs and twisting branches? Very few High Elves can trace their lineage back this far. The resources that went into creating a chart like this ... let's just say it would take far more gold than I'm likely to see in this lifetime. And we High Elves live a long time!"
"15453358-0-231";"Some kind of trap. Difficult to say if it's for animals or people. Knowing Nagas, it's the latter. Looks like they repurposed a crocodile's skull so it latches onto the torso of any who trigger it. Look at the size of it. Never seen a crocodile that size."
"15453358-0-232";"What a beautiful stone-carving! Argonians don't often dwell on death, but they do like to commemorate it with one of these grave stakes (or xul-vaat's in the lizards' native tongue). When an Argonian dies, their kin plant this stake as a memorial."
"15453358-0-233";"By Auri-El, look at this crystal bowl! Difficult, given those shimmering facets in the glass. It seems to gather up sunlight, doesn't it? I can barely look at it without squinting! Legends tell of a tribe of Argonians who could wield the power of Magnus with precious stones. The sheer radiance of this crystal makes me think those stories are true. I just can't believe they fashioned it into a bowl. Not a weapon, jewelry, or armor. A bowl. It must have contained something truly marvelous."
"15453358-0-234";"If you look close, you can tell this is a fabrication. A real claw would have faded over time. This looks made out of some kind of stone, and though the inscription is faded, there's definitely something written on it."
"15453358-0-235";"Interesting design here, it's made for a Khajiit face certainly but it doesn't look all that well constructed. There are inadequacies there that can't be attributed to just time."
"15453358-0-236";"While I'm sure this would be a controversial opinion, I feel in my gut that this cloth belonged to Queen Anequina Sharp-Tongue. It's widely agreed upon that the queen spent time meditating in the temple of Jode's Light during her time. Many times her story is overshadowed by Khunzar-ri, but she was an equal force, one that is awe-inspiring even today! If the stories are to be believed, this cloth holds the tears of the queen, when she returned to her temple after Khunzar-ri's death."
"15453358-0-237";"What a unique and fascinating weapon! It's spear-like in shape, but massive in size. Only a giant could properly wield such a tool! A Pahmar-Raht, maybe? No, it's still too big."
"15453358-0-238";"Well, this shield is certainly ... tall. Lugging this around would have taken a considerable amount of effort. But the thickness makes it almost impenetrable. And what is this ironwork? It's unlike any I've seen."
"15453358-0-239";"By Syrabane's ring, this is magnificent! I never thought an iron sphere could look so beautiful. There's something about it that's just so … intriguing. I can almost hear it whispering to me. Even now, my hands tremble with the thought of letting go! These symbols here—unlike any I've seen. Akaviri? Or even Dovah? No. that's not possible. Seems the charming magic imbued into this iron is still quite potent. Meant to lure a beast to its doom, no doubt! Someone take this thing away from me!"
"15453358-0-240";"A handsome piece! Horker-tusk ivory, if I'm not mistaken. Nord ivory-hunters waiting for the sea-ice to thaw often passed the time by carving small toys and trinkets for their sweethearts. The weathered runes probably commemorate a loved one."
"15453358-0-241";"The silver filigree clearly show that this horn belonged to an important thane. I don't recognize this ivory, though. A horn from a supernatural beast such as a Dragon might confer magical strength or good fortune on any who imbibe from it!"
"15453358-0-242";"The belt or girdle of a Nord king is nearly as important as his crown. It symbolizes strength, vitality, martial prowess, and of course wealth. The sheer magnificence of this huge gold buckle indicates that it was part of a king's regalia in the early decades of the First Nordic Empire. Look, here, you can see the depiction of victory over the Dragon Cult, and here you can see the very first Moot of the Nords, which King Harald summoned to his mead-hall sometime around 1E 184. Extraordinary!"
"15453358-0-243";"Is this some kind of Psijic folio? At last! A chance to reveal their shrouded mysteries! Their hidden truths! Wait—why is it blank? Is this a joke? An unused booklet? An Elf tries not to get her hopes up …. How depressing."
"15453358-0-244";"Appears to be some kind of wand. Beech or Hickory, I think. So plain in appearance that some might use it in a game of fetch with the family dog. But I'd advise against that. There's a powerful magic at its core."
"15453358-0-245";"I've never seen one of these! A famed Ritemaster's Slate. According to Psijic tomes, ritemasters like Iachesis used these unassuming objects to write theorems and spells, then store them in a harmless demiplane for later use. A journal unlike any other! I only wish I could travel to the strange realm these theorems reside in. Do the thoughts move or talk? Are they reduced to ash, then reassembled? I fear we will never know."
"15453358-0-246";"Ha! Do you know what this is? It's no treasure from a clam, I can tell you that. This is a genuine grummite pearl! According to Divayth Fyr's tome of oddities, these creatures lurk in bogs all over Sheogorath's realm, the Shivering Isles."
"15453358-0-247";"Even a paradise holds danger--especially one that once resided in a Daedric realm. Notice the six equal sides, each marked with a different symbol. Disturbing, yes? And don't roll it! That way lies madness. Literally. We should lock this away immediately."
"15453358-0-248";"I've read about objects like this, but I've never actually seen one. The great mage, Shalidor, apparently traveled to several planes of Oblivion, gathering crystals from at least five different realms. Using an exceedingly dangerous transmutation spell, he managed to merge these crystals into an alloyed spell-focus like this. Centuries of neglect have left this one inert, but you're not likely to find a denser agglomeration of Padomaic matter."
"15453358-0-249";"This is a beauty. Most of the free-standing anvils in Old Orsinium melted into slag or still gather dust in Redguard treasure vaults. To see one in such great condition ... it melts this tusker's heart!"
"15453358-0-250";"I've only seen something like this once--an artist's rendering we found in a Worm Cult hideout. It's radiating ... something. I can't really explain it, but I'm detecting a gap in the flow of natural magicka."
"15453358-0-251";"Difficult to say with certainty where this throne came from, but I think we can safely assume Wood Elves created it. Even a master carpenter couldn't achieve results like the draping under the seat with conventional tools and methods."
"15453358-0-252";"Well, this is unmistakably Wood Elf craft. Granted, I haven't spent as much time around the Bosmer as Ugron and Amalien, but I'm fairly certain you can find chimes like this in present day settlements. Still ... I sense something peculiar here."
"15453358-0-253";"Wood Elf villages produce the most proficient bonesmiths in Tamriel, but some Nord bone-dressers display a similar talent. While I'd never display such a macabre item in my home, there is a certain beauty to the craftsmanship. I guess."
"15453358-0-254";"There's old magic clinging to this statue. No great surprise there. Ancient Argonian statuary always seems to carry some vaguely malignant power. Not an out-and-out curse, mind you! But something on that creepy spectrum."
"15453358-0-255";"I've seen a few weathered mosaics depicting a feather like this alongside strange Aldmeri triremes, but I've never seen the genuine article. Looks like some kind of meteoric substance to me, but the color's unique. Gabrielle can probably speak to that."
"15453358-0-256";"You found this in Rivenspire? Hardly a surprise there. That region attracts unsettling relics like a sweet roll attracts children. The crystal clearly has Ayleid origins, but I've never seen a varla or welkynd stone with such an angry hue."
"15453358-0-257";"A sap relic that didn't come from Black Marsh? What a welcome surprise! I've never seen such a beautiful Wood Elf antiquity. I associate the Bosmer so much with bone, and rotmeth, and insect parts that I forget what wonders the Green Pact can produce!"
"15453358-0-258";"An Ayleid sword, eh? Truly wondrous craftsmanship. Pity they probably used it to slaughter any of our ancestors who defied their supremacy. Odd that they would venerate this broken blade. Whoever wielded it must have commanded a great deal of respect."
"15453358-0-259";"This isn't particularly old, but it's still noteworthy. We don't fully understand where it came from, but that obelisk in Craglorn stirred up all sorts of arcane mischief. Looks like it even managed to bend natural law here."
"15453358-0-260";"What a gorgeous scabbard. I suspect this belonged to a high-ranking Yokudan warrior—perhaps even a sword saint! I'm especially intrigued by this array of stones. They must be aetherial fragments of some kind."
"15453358-0-261";"Wow! Given the iconography on this pyramid, I think we can safely assume this object predates the rise of the Tribunal! See how there's no reference to Almsivi? These marks venerate the old gods: Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura."
"15453358-0-262";"King Emeric has a trove quite similar to this. Most people never get to see it, of course. But you'd be surprised how far a well-placed invisibility spell can get you in Wayrest Castle!"
"15453358-0-263";"What a prime example of Orcish musical craftsmanship. People tend not to associate music with Orcs, but we have a deep cultural investment in percussion instruments. I can pretty much guarantee this served as a war drum."
"15453358-0-264";"This architecture looks Elven, certainly, but the silhouette and the stone clearly differ from that of the Ayleids, Dwarves, Chimer and other mainland mer. Given the location, it's almost certainly Snow Elf architecture."
"15453358-0-265";"What a gorgeous triptych. Someone clearly placed a fixative spell on the frame. The painting itself is probably far older than it looks. I have no idea what place it's meant to depict, though."
"15453358-0-266";"I've seen a little bit of everything, and I can say with total certainty, I have never seen anything like this. I haven't the foggiest idea how it operates, what it's made of, or what it does. You have my deepest apologies."
"15453358-0-267";"It's been quite some time since I've seen such a well-preserved Chimer table. The volcanic rock seems consistent with the pre-Tribunal aesthetic. The sigil in the center is particularly noteworthy. Could this really have belonged to the Sixth House?"
"15453358-0-268";"A bust of Saint Nerevar. A worthy discovery, to be sure. You don't often find such realistic depictions of Dunmer religious figures. The sculptor may have spent some time in the Imperial City. I see similarities to Bruma School works. 1E 2800's perhaps?"
"15453358-0-269";"A brilliant stone basin of some variety, eh? Obviously, this served as some devotional object to the Khajiiti moon-gods, Jone and Jode. The smaller pools depict various lunar phases. Difficult to say what the Khajiit actually used it for, though."
"15453358-0-270";"I find Argonian relics endlessly fascinating—particularly those from their ""stone nest"" period. This appears to be some sort of basin. Best not to assume, where Argonians are involved, but it stands to reason they'd use this for Hist sap rituals."
"15453358-0-271";"Ah, a relic from the homeland! It's clearly a sarcophagus. The question is, who's buried inside? Judging by the state of the stone, I'd say late first Era. A servant of one of the pretender-kings that took power after the Alessian secession, perhaps?"
"15453358-0-272";"Here's a pretty cup. Sturdy, too! This predates the rise of Harald by a few centuries at least. Difficult to identify the figure on the side with certainty, but here's a good rule of thumb: if the artwork predates Harald, it's a depiction of Ysgramor."
"15453358-0-273";"What a find! I'd have to take a closer look, but the body of the brazier looks like stalhrim! Can you imagine? Ice infused with divine power, making it hard as steel! I've only ever seen it employed in arms, armor, and burial rituals."
"15453358-0-274";"A Na-Totambu ceremonial gong! I've only ever seen the disc--never the frame. Looks like they fashioned it to resemble their everything-deity: Satakal. According to myth, the snake devours itself in a never-ending cycle of rebirth. Brilliant, eh?"
"15453358-0-275";"I've got to say, the realism of this guar statue is positively uncanny! Sculpting busts of famous saints is one thing, but sculpting a beast like this in such vivid detail is pretty remarkable for ancient Dark Elf statuary."
"15453358-0-276";"You don't see many of these. An Ayleid light fixture like this probably shed light over the banquet hall of some cruel sorcerer king. That's definitely meteoric iron, and the welkynd stones are in fine condition. On the whole, a worthy discovery."
"15453358-0-277";"Gilded, Imperial bust depicting a winged bull? It's got to be Morihaus, the bull-faced lover of Alessia. The questions with Morihaus is always, ""How literal is too literal?"" and ""Is this literal enough?"" I'm sure Reginus and Amalien have opinions …."
"15453358-0-278";"I've seen one of these before. In the stacks, back in the Imperial City. The Moth Priests used it for ritual washing, or something. I assume clean hands are preferred when handling an Elder Scroll!"
"15453358-0-279";"I can scarcely believe I'm saying this, but you may have discovered a sculpture of the mother of the First Empire, Saint Alessia. You see? She still bears the shackles of Ayleid enslavement, and holds the Amulet of Kings aloft. It's her. It's Paravant."
"15453358-0-280";"What a spectacular example of early-Tribunal sacerdotal architecture! Few races take their religious designs more seriously than the Dark Elves. The Hand of the Tribunal decorates the central dais, but this clearly honors one over the other two."
"15453358-0-281";"What’s this? The White-Gold Tower rendered in miniature? Odd that it doesn't include the city itself. Doubly odd that it's giving off such a strong magical aura. What function did this serve? And what's this light radiating from the top?"
"15453358-0-282";"I've seen markings like this before, on the walls of Yasammidan. These etchings appear inert, but I'd still mind how you speak around it. Ensorcelled gates—even long abandoned ones—aren't something to tinker with."
"15453358-0-283";"From the design of the plinth, I'd date this back to early First Era—at least a millennia before the Thrassian illness laid Elsweyr low. I doubt any of the sixteen kingdoms outside Pellitine would have had the resources to craft something like this."
"15453358-0-284";"A Khajiiti ornamental mirror. Interesting. You'd expect to find an object like this in one of the grand palaces of Anequina or Pellitine. The fact that it survived in such a war-torn region speaks to its quality, I think."
"15453358-0-285";"We don't often see renderings of sea serpents. Fascinating! It's a bit difficult to determine the age given the corrosion, but we can deduce its origin easily enough: Pyandonea. The Sea Elves do love their snakes!"
"15453358-0-286";"Don't know if we can call this an antiquity. Age doesn't mean anything in Oblivion, and this is definitely Daedric Prince-craft. A display piece of some kind. Or a warning to keep the servants in line."
"15453358-0-287";"A whale totem, eh? The Nord god, Stuhn, still has totemic roots. Never seen something like this hewn from opal, though. You typically only see this kind of stone in Elsweyr. Can't imagine the Atmorans traded with the Khajiit prior to the Dragon War."
"15453358-0-288";"A fully intact stained glass window? Simply remarkable! Someone clearly packed it away with great care. One can't help but wonder why they squirreled such a masterpiece away. I've never seen a window like this in the Khajiiti temples I've visited."
"15453358-0-289";"To the untrained eye, this sconce might appear to portray Kynareth, but it depicts nothing of the sort. This is a votive chandelier to the Daedric Prince, Meridia, guaranteed. Hardly the sort of thing you'd want lighting your dining room table."
"15453358-0-290";"Well, this is quite a discovery! Ayleid, by the looks of it. Sorcerer kings ruled the Tamrielic heartlands for centuries, but I've never seen one of their crowns. It seems fixed onto the skull, but I don't see any rivets."
"15453358-0-291";"Ah, an Ayleid sconce of some variety. I can't imagine it's a lightwell. Far too small for Aetherial conduction. And this glass fragment at the center—is it a broken welkynd stone? It certainly does resemble a lightwell. Curious."
"15453358-0-292";"You find quite a few jeweled eyes in the dungeoneering business, but an entire skull fashioned from precious stones? That's a true prize. Shows all the signs of a Dragon Cult relic. Probably some sort of ritual focus used during sacrifices."
"15453358-0-293";"What a fascinating bauble! Dwarven-make, obviously. But what does it do? Those circular elements at the center of each facet might fit into some secondary device. I've never see a Dwarven key that actually looks like a key!"
"15453358-0-294";"This is a remarkable find. We don't see many fox totems in Skyrim. The style is unique as well. Atmoran totemic art typically features harder edges and more abstract shapes. I'm honestly not sure who made this."
"15453358-0-295";"Never seen anything like this, and I've spent many cold nights in Khajiiti tombs. The Riddle'Thar cult swept a lot of Khajiiti myths under the rug during the Elsweyr reunification. You think this is one of the spirits they scrubbed from the pantheon?"
"15453358-0-296";"I've always loved Khajiiti needlework. The color and texture on this tapestry are tremendous, despite its age. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I suspect that winged figure is an artist's depiction of Khenarthi--the Khajiiti goddess of the wind."
"15453358-0-297";"What a stirring landscape! It resembles the work of Reman II's court painter, Emilia Polus. She revolutionized the art of landscape painting--serving as a bridge between dreamy Alessian scenery-painting and the stark realism of early Potentate works."
"15453358-0-298";"If I didn't know any better, I'd say this chair is of Snow Elf make. What a remarkable find! Icy stone would have been murder on the bum, but I suppose any cushioning would have disintegrated over the ages."
"15453358-0-299";"Always good to see a relic from the homeland. A tusk arrangement like this usually marks an entrance of a chief or forge-wife's longhouse. The scale of these tusks is pretty damned impressive. Haven't seen a mammoth that size in my lifetime."
"15453358-0-300";"No great mystery who this belonged to. Every Breton knows those motifs! It's a throne of House Spenard. Good riddance to poor sovereigns! Rivenspire's suffered more than its fair share of despots, but the Spenards put the others to shame."
"15453358-0-301";"Ah, this exhibits the masterful craftsmanship one would expect from a Na-Totambu relic! These gold motifs seem consistent with Ra Gada heraldry, but the purple interior matches the hue of Ruptga prayer beads. The lack of star motifs seems odd, too."
"15453358-0-302";"It's rare to find a Yokudan statue that isn't wielding a sword. Well done. This looks like a depiction of Morwha—the fertility goddess. Based on the items she's holding, I'd say this statue came from Yokuda itself."
"15453358-0-303";"A Wood Elf ritual cauldron, eh? I find Bosmer magic absolutely fascinating! This is the first Wood Elf spell-focus I've seen, though. I was under the impression they could weave their magic with singing alone. What did they put in this bowl?"
"15453358-0-304";"This is fascinating. You don't see a lot of frost weaponry with the Dwemer. I don't know why. Maybe it's because they hated the cold? They lived underground and relied on thermal heat from the earth to power their society. Naturally averse?"
"15453358-0-305";"This looks like some kind of shimmer-thrower--you know, like the ones the Baandari use during festivals? We haven't seen much in the way of Dwemer frivolity but if this was a kind of firelight show, that could prove everyone wrong! How exciting!"
"15453358-0-306";"Even after all this time, this still carries traces of magical energy. You can feel the hairs on your arm rising whenever you touch it. Can you imagine harnessing this sort of power during a siege?"
"15453358-0-307";"A Dwarven star chart! Marvelous! I think Guildmaster Vanus has one like this in his private study, but I doubt he has any clear idea of what it actually depicts. The key constellations appear on one of the discs, obviously. Beyond that? I'm not sure."
"15453358-0-308";"Nedic architecture--my specialty! This shrine conforms to the Nedic architectural aesthetics we found in Craglorn, with a few notable exceptions. The central element strongly resembles a Mundus Stone, but I don't recognize the constellation."
"15453358-0-310";"This may be the rarest coin ever minted by Tamrielic hands. Shortly after Akatosh’s final Alessian visitation, a renowned Ayleid smith named Lirulorne struck a handful of masterwork coins for the fallen empress’s consort, Morihaus. Some interpreted the gesture as reparations for humanity's long enslavement, others considered it simple tribute. Whatever the case, the peerless craftsmanship and extravagant composition proves that even the conquered recognized the divine legitimacy of Alessia's rule."
"15453358-0-312";"I think it's fairly obvious that this is a depiction of the Gold Coast. A beautifully rendered one at that."
"15453358-0-313";"Given the relative position of the land to the Dragontail Mountains, this has to be a map of Craglorn. Marvelous!"
"15453358-0-314";"I think we're all in agreement that this is a map of Coldharbour, yes? Take it from someone who knows: Coldharbour is hard to forget."
"15453358-0-315";"I believe this is a map of Hew's Bane. It has a very distinctive shape. Does anyone else think it looks like a horse?"
"15453358-0-316";"Unusual. Most old books one discovers in the Reach are plunder carried off from neighboring lands. The Imperial officer who wrote this text was likely part of the garrison Empress Hestra posted to this land in the 11th century of the First Era."
"15453358-0-317";"A shame that few examples of Reach leatherworking survive from the author's time. It would be interesting to compare modern Reach iconography with the designs and tooling of First Era clans. Do the same animals still appear?"
"15453358-0-318";"Interesting. Reach footwear does not seem to have changed much at all across the centuries. I have seen new examples of the hide-and-fleece boots described by the author in the market stalls of Markarth. They are almost identical."
"15453358-0-319";"Our Imperial author omits the fact that Reachmen frequently rebuilt their bows; composite bows degrade quickly in damp climates. However, the sturdy horn or hardwood that forms the end of each limb was often re-used for generations."
"15453358-0-320";"I find it difficult to believe that even multiple layers of toughened leather could provide much resistance to puncture, but Ugron assures me that well-made hide armor can dissipate the power of a thrust or arrow surprisingly well."
"15453358-0-321";"I see few modern examples of the sort of sharpened antlers and flaked stone the author describes. I believe that over the centuries Reachmen have grown more skilled at metalwork, and simple iron knives are growing commonplace in this land."
"15453358-0-322";"I must say, I am surprised that this tome is so well preserved. The binding is falling apart, of course, but the parchment has stood up to the centuries quite well. I suppose few of the book's Reachman owners spent much time handling it."
"15453358-0-323";"Note the use of antlers in headwear. That tradition long predates the observations of an Imperial officer from the middle of the First Era. The antlers are meant to show respect for Hircine, Lord of the Hunt and chief among the Reachman deities."
"15453358-0-324";"Greaves and shoulderpieces are the most durable elements of a Reachman's armor. Warriors often cover up or repair battle damage by re-carving the images. After years of use, the original design is often completely obscured."
"15453358-0-325";"Interesting. The style of weapon our Imperial officer describes seems to have fallen out of favor across the centuries. Most Reachman maces I see now are wooden cudgels reinforced with hammered bands of copper or iron."
"15453358-0-326";"I wish Lieutenant Nestoro had made some effort to illustrate the clan markings and designs that she encountered during her time. I am very curious about clans that have died out, and whether their markings are appropriated by later clans."
"15453358-0-327";"I presume that the purpose of the rather outlandish shoulder-pieces is intimidation, not armor. I doubt whether a few rib-bones or small animal skulls provide any real protection from enemy blows."
"15453358-0-328";"I have never seen a Reach witch without a staff. I wonder if there is a correlation between the type of wood used to fashion a staff and the elemental energy it channels. Is it the shape or the substance that dictates a staff's magical properties?"
"15453358-0-329";"The author makes a fascinating observation about swords beaten into new shapes. I wonder how many Reachman cleavers and choppers began their lives as Breton longswords or Nord greatswords. Have any historic blades been ruined in this way?"
"15453358-0-335";"Here's a pretty thing. Breton make, I should think. But the band is too broad and heavy for simple decoration. It lacks ostentation. Is it just me or does it seem like something's missing? Like this is just part of a greater whole?"
"15453358-0-336";"This looks like a jewelry setting for precious stones and signets. Breton by the looks of it. Late fifth century, 1E. But there's something else — an engraving that reads, ""Vigor through Blood."" Gracious. That's a bit unsettling."
"15453358-0-337";"This appears to be a signet of some kind. Ancient Breton heraldry. The shield is flanked by boars and snares. Or are they nooses? Difficult to say. Can't say as I've ever seen a coat of arms this ... ominous."
"15453358-0-338";"This metal band is too thin to be a ring on its own. I'd say it's the inner loop of a larger ring--a signet maybe. There's an engraving here. Looks like an Elven name to me, but the styling's too angular for merish work."
"15453358-0-339";"Polished onyx stones cut in the High Rock style. They're too small to serve as the centerpiece of a ring or necklace, but maybe accent stones? Yeah. See the prong-scratches? I bet they flanked a larger precious stone--or even a signet."
"15453358-0-340";"This strand is so thin and lustrous I almost thought it was spider silk. Now I see it's actually threaded silver! The only place I've ever seen jewelry like this is around the necks of High Elf Sapiarchs."
"15453358-0-341";"I don't think I've ever seen a pearl this large and lustrous--and believe me, I attended more than my fair share of soirees in the Imperial City's Nobles District. I'm no naturalist, but it must come from a deep sea shellfish of some variety."
"15453358-0-342";"That's quite an array of pearls there. Based on the curious shape and the pinker hue, I believe these come from freshwater shellfish. Anyone could have fished them out, but the High Elf aesthetic of this pouch they're in makes their origins quite clear."
"15453358-0-343";"Hmm. Elf-craft for sure. Looks like some kind of jewelry clasp, but it's made entirely out of coral. Don't find many items like this outside the Summerset Isles. Judging by the intricacy, it must have belonged to someone important. A curate maybe."
"15453358-0-344";"These appear to be polished quartz beads. Several Tamrielic cultures employ beads like this in religious practice--particularly the High Elves and Khajiit. Now that I take a close look at them, though, they might not be quartz after all."
"15453358-0-345";"Look at the precision here. These hinges seem impossibly small, but they open as easily as a well-greased tavern door. I can't even begin to imagine the tools required for making something like this."
"15453358-0-346";"Is it just me, or do these look like eyes? Perhaps from an insect, or even a crab! I also detect a hint of blue in what I think are the sockets. Do I dare to consider that these eyes were fashioned from aetherium? Of course I do!"
"15453358-0-347";"The shafts here seem to connect to a central frame; something ovoid and squat from the looks of it. Animunculi mimic organic shapes more often than not, so what could this be? An insect of some kind? Difficult to tell."
"15453358-0-348";"This bizarre component looks like the beating heart of the animunculus with slots to accommodate other pieces. Obviously, we can't read the inscription, but they could be instructions for how to assemble whatever goes around this structure."
"15453358-0-349";"Wings! How beautiful! Though they're separate from whatever Dwarven creature they made fly, I think it's quite obvious we're dealing with an animunculus that might resemble some kind of beetle. A rather large one, at that!"
"15453358-0-350";"The design is so delicate I'm almost afraid to handle them too roughly. Not that I don't trust Dwarven craftsmanship, but we should take care not to break them. They look entirely functional, almost like they should be sitting below an overgrown cicada."
"15453358-0-351";"The plating on the neck allows the head to move back and forth, which might be considered unsettling if the head itself wasn't so adorable. It's the head of a beetle, or scarab, which is quite exciting! An undiscovered animunculus!"
"15453358-0-352";"Dwarven arms and armor are crafted from alloys whose secrets vanished with the Dwemer, but even after centuries upon centuries they remain stronger than anything we can make today. This particular helm reminds me of an ant with prominent antennas. Hardly the sort of emblem to strike fear into one's enemies, but then again, ants show fearlessness and unity of purpose in their tiny wars. Or perhaps Amalien's habit of unfounded speculation is rubbing off on me."
"15453358-0-353";"Reachfolk are not known for their fine art, but their folk art has a rawness of emotion that never fails to impress me. This simple painting depicts the greatest hero in the history of the Reach, the legendary rebel named Red Eagle."
"15453358-0-354";"This isn't just a piece of any ordinary glass. There's latent magical energy in this, I can feel it without even touching it. On a hunch, I held it up to the light and I can confirm that it somehow changes the light coming through."
"15453358-0-355";"I'm surprised by the thoroughness of this. Authentic maps of the Reach are hard to come by, especially before 1E 1000. I wonder who put this to paper, and how they went about acquiring that information."
"15453358-0-356";"I'll be honest, I'm not sure what I'm looking at. Almost looks like farming equipment, but I doubt they had anything so sophisticated. I'd believe it was a weapon before I'd believe it was anything agricultural."
"15453358-0-357";"This looks like a mining tool, from somewhere around 1E 240 if I had to guess. Quite sophisticated for its time, but maybe that's due to the size. This looks like a personal apparatus. Not used for large scale ore extraction, certainly."
"15453358-0-358";"During the first era, ten Reach kings ruled the region. We know precious little about the kings themselves, but I came across an Imperial account of a Reach chief named Noldan. When his clan submitted to Imperial forces, he gifted the Imperial commander his flint spear, purportedly dipped in blood. Unfortunately for the Imperial, Noldan coated the spear in lethal poison, not blood. Those who handled it before the deception was discovered suffered miserable deaths. So, let's handle this with care."
"15453358-0-359";"A map of Western Skyrim, eh? Damned odd to find an ancient map that leaves out the holds east of Morthal. The cartographer probably worked as a caravaner--marking trade routes near Solitude's sphere of influence."
"15453358-0-360";"I'm surprised at the condition of this. I'd take care handling it from here on out, the binding is particularly weak. The fact that it's survived all this time is a wonder."
"15453358-0-361";"Interesting. It's a shame that these original symbols haven't survived the passage of time. I would be curious to know in what ways they inspired current Imperial garb."
"15453358-0-362";"Our author writes about this so casually. I suppose he couldn't have possibly known the kind of influence the Akaviri would have on the Empire at the time, though the very act of writing this account might suggest he at least had an inkling."
"15453358-0-363";"Bows are pretty standard across all disciplines, races and times. It sounds like the ones this soldier describes are similar to the type of weapon we see today. A string, a curved length of material and some tension. That's all you need."
"15453358-0-364";"The Akaviri's style of armorsmithing changed the Imperial legions irrevocably. It took a great deal of time, of course, but no one can dispute their influence."
"15453358-0-365";"I'd be curious to know the kind of material the ancient Akaviri fashioned their daggers out of. Shame the author doesn't specify."
"15453358-0-366";"I imagine tensions were high between the Akaviri and the Imperials at the time, but I wish our author had consulted with an actual armorsmith while writing this account. More clarity on the handwrappings would likely be fascinating."
"15453358-0-367";"By far the most unique aspect of the ancient Akaviri's armor. Even the author sounds impressed, as he well should be. The distinct shape and flare was likely something that had never been seen before in Tamriel."
"15453358-0-368";"The Akaviri were certainly not the first to go light on the legs when it comes to armor, but it seems to have surprised our dear author. I shudder to think of what kind of stiff plate armor the Imperials had to walk around in at the time."
"15453358-0-369";"I wonder what the soldiers who first went up against the Akaviri thought of the maces described here. Must have been quite a sight with those long spikes."
"15453358-0-370";"""Dragons in flight,"" huh? Seems fortuitous, considering what they saw Reman as. That's definitely something that hasn't fallen out of style."
"15453358-0-371";"The words here are nearly illegible. Time faded the ink almost completely. Let's be even more gentle with this tome than we think we need to be. I'd hate to lose it."
"15453358-0-372";"The rings the author describes baffle me. What function could those have possibly served? The Akaviri of old seem too practical to do anything for style alone."
"15453358-0-373";"You can almost hear the reverence our author had for these weapons. Not surprising. I'm sure they looked something fierce against the swords being made in Tamriel at the time."
"15453358-0-374";"Something in Black Marsh just refuses to let Argonians rest easy. Even pinned down by their xul-vaat burial stakes, dead lizard folk still manage to stand up and cause trouble. You'll often see them wearing masks like this, though this one is far older and hewn from higher-quality wood. Native Argonians won't explain the practice. Part of me wonders if they put their dead in masks because they don't want to see a beloved egg-brother's face when they have to beat him back into the grave."
"15453358-0-375";"Well, this is no Argonian relic, that much is obvious. Note the curvilinear design elements. I'd say it's Kothringi; the question is, what does it depict? A lot of these shapes seem reminiscent of waves. Some kind of nautical deity?"
"15453358-0-376";"What a magnificent vessel! Given the location, one might assume it's of Argonian make, but I assure you, this is Kothringi craftsmanship. Their shipbuilding tradition is very idiosyncratic. Unusual paddle placement, shallow draft, and a sail! Intriguing!"
"15453358-0-377";"I recognize this style from the First Era, shortly after Reman II took the Ruby Throne. It absolutely boggles the mind to see something so old so undamaged. We should count ourselves very lucky for such a find."
"15453358-0-378";"It's hard to tell without having the fully formed piece, but this looks Ayleid in origin to me. Barsaebic Ayleids, to be specific. Those worn symbols might have been to honor the Aedra."
"15453358-0-379";"There is no way to tell whether or not this tool was truly used by Saint Kaladas. But given the area in which it was found, its age, and the relatively well-preserved nature, I'm inclined to at least entertain the theory. Kaladas constructed the The Great Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin and some records say he was fond of using highly ornamented tools like this during the process. I suppose it would make sense. Buildings constructed without painstaking measurement rarely last this long."
"15453358-0-380";"This is a map of the Blackwood region. The parchment is worn, but it is still detailed, especially along the coast. There is something strange here, though I can't put my finger on it. Still, the map shows caves even I've forgotten about!"
"15453358-0-381";"Well! Does anyone else find this stone as unsettling as I do? It doesn't feel necessarily evil, just ... immensely powerful. I would not use this to juggle, is what I'm saying."
"15453358-0-382";"This inscription is faded almost completely, like it's been worn smooth. It looks as though whoever handled this rubbed it down over time. Whether that was on purpose, or merely a function of the signet itself, I can't say."
"15453358-0-383";"Ooh, spooky! I'm positive this is some kind of bridge that once held jewels for a ring, but the open spaces kind of make the whole thing look like a grinning fanged mouth! Daedra, anyone?"
"15453358-0-384";"At first glance, it might be missed, but the prongs (that I assume were likely fashioned to hold jewels of some kind) are actually conduits for magicka. They're specially crafted to keep the integrity of the prongs even when dealing with powerful magic."
"15453358-0-385";"Has anyone else noticed the hooks on the inside of this loop? They're miniscule, but I would think putting such a thing around your finger would be rather painful. I don't recommend anyone trying it."
"15453358-0-386";"Can anyone make out the carving here? It's so small, it actually took me a bit to notice it. This link of chain radiates powerful magicka, but without knowing what this symbol is, I can't really guess at what kind."
"15453358-0-387";"This looks Imperial in design, perhaps from as far back as the Alessian Empire. This is most certainly part of a larger set. The broken links on either end suggest this was part of a full chain at some point in time."
"15453358-0-388";"This is definitely Hircine's symbol! That could mean any number of things, but since it's etched into this chain I'm going to guess it's from a necklace or some kind of specialized armor to honor this particular Daedric prince."
"15453358-0-389";"I don't know who would want to wear such a ghastly piece of jewelry, but I assure you, this is part of a chain that one might wear around their neck. I wouldn't be caught dead in something like that, but Ayleids had a taste for the avant garde."
"15453358-0-390";"This kind of clasp came into fashion in the First Era, specifically around 1E 100 during the Enduin Artistic Movement. For a brief and shining moment, function was in fashion. As a jewelry collector, I must confess, I'm envious."
"15453358-0-391";"A roll of perfectly preserved leather. Surprisingly supple for its age. Judging by the texture, I'd say it came from something large and reptilian. A wamasu or haj mota perhaps?"
"15453358-0-392";"Precious stones are hard to come by in Black Marsh, but some still find their way into the region. Argonians use polished blue jaspers like this in their jewelry. But this one is faceted. Unusual."
"15453358-0-393";"You find a lot of these glass beads in Kothringi burial cairns. Typically on a string or in a small pouch. They didn't use them as currency, but often wore them on their wrists or ankles. One of the few items of clothing they favored."
"15453358-0-394";"A real Lilmothiit waist sash! It's not an actual Lilmothiit tail. At least, I don't think it is. Do Lilmothiit even have tails? Question for another time. This one is made from a strip of wolf fur, I think. I've never seen a wolf in Black Marsh, though."
"15453358-0-395";"Here's a relic I wouldn't mind taking for my personal collection. You can't buy cord this strong in any market I've visited. Looks like something nautical. Boat rigging, or the lead on a harpoon. Beautiful. Just beautiful."
"15453358-0-396";"Now, this is what we in the tomb-studies tradition call a mixed blessing. Hand-etched glass, perfect symmetry in the carving, etc. It's a masterpiece. And that's why I can virtually guarantee it's cursed."
"15453358-0-397";"An array of perfectly preserved feathers? Quite a curious find. People don't often go to such lengths to maintain something like this. I don't recognize the exact species, but they resemble the betva-hen feathers naheesh elders often wear."
"15453358-0-398";"We don't often see such weighty metalwork in Argonian relics. Too heavy for steel. Whatever the alloy, I wouldn't wear it. Reginus often accuses me of being big-headed, but even a neck as strong and graceful as mine would struggle under this weight!"
"15453358-0-399";"Teeth! Always a macabre favorite of mine! Most of the time we find teeth from terrestrial or semi-aquatic species in Argonian antiquities, but these look like shark teeth. Maybe these came from an ancient maritime operation?"
"15453358-0-400";"Long strips of fabric, not leather. Unusual. We most often see Argonian fabrics in bandages or poultices, but these are pristine. I suppose they might have used them as a belt or other accessory for an Argonian of high station."
"15453358-0-401";"Difficult to make out what this tapestry scrap might be depicting, what with all this worked-in dirt. We might be able to identify it eventually; it will just take some long and careful cleaning."
"15453358-0-402";"This weaving pattern is fairly distinctive. You often see this sort of thing in Trans-Niben fabrics. The technique may have originated in Elsweyr, but the nobility in Leyawiin made it famous."
"15453358-0-403";"I have no idea what's smeared all over this tapestry, but I'm pretty sure it's not blood. Ambergris, maybe? Shame. The weaving on this is remarkable."
"15453358-0-404";"Based on the imagery, I'd say this was torn from a larger tapestry. The sort that might take a decade to weave. Alas, fabrics rarely withstand the ravages of time."
"15453358-0-405";"Looks like a dog got hold of this. I'm not joking. Look at the stretching here and the crusting at the edges. Whoever gave this to their mutt had no idea how valuable it is."
"15453358-0-406";"Seems that someone might have used this scrap as a quilt patch. Well-worn, that's for certain. Treat this one with care or it's liable to come apart."
"15453358-0-407";"This looks like a woman's face? Difficult to tell with all the fraying. Whoever she is, she's a subject of adoration. Mara or Dibella most likely."
"15453358-0-408";"There's a compass on this scrap, I'd bet my chair on it! Odd to see map in tapestry form. A mapestry as it were! Ugron, I know you're groaning, but the world deserves more hilarious portmanteaus!"
"15453358-0-409";"Someone used this to wipe down surfaces--polishing boots or something like that. Damn shame. What imagery I can make out is quite beautiful."
"15453358-0-410";"Doesn't look like this tapestry scrap has seen the light of day in well over a century. Someone likely kept it squirreled away, hoping to reunite it with other fragments. Hopefully, we can finish the work they left undone."
"15453358-0-411";"Is it just me, or does this look like someone used it as a napkin? Maybe even a babe's bib. You'd be surprised how many priceless relics make it onto peasants' kitchen tables."
"15453358-0-412";"This might be the face of Zenithar! Alas, it's been pierced about a dozen times. Seems some bow-toting iconoclast used it as target practice. Joke's on them. Desecrating a rendering of the Divines is seven years bad luck!"
"15453358-0-413";"Someone tried to fix this scrap of tapestry with needle and thread. Unfortunately, they botched the job. This needlework is sloppy, but with patience we can remove it."
"15453358-0-414";"Ugh, what a mess. Looks like a whole family of moths ate their fill of this tapestry scrap. We might be able to fix it. It will take a lot of patience and creativity, though."
"15453358-0-415";"Just look at the blues in this tapestry scrap. I've never seen such rich azure pigments. Acquiring vibrant colors like this would cost a small fortune. Some wealthy noble must have really loved their weaving."
"15453358-0-416";"Some treatise on axe-making, it seems? Intriguing. I wouldn't have expected to find some ancient Dark Elf text in the Deadlands, but with all that's happening in Tamriel and beyond nowadays, I shouldn't be surprised."
"15453358-0-417";"Seems this book caught fire at some point. No surprise there. The Deadlands are hard on paper. The only reason any of it remains is the Dark Elf binding. They know a thing or two about lava."
"15453358-0-418";"The text here is curious. Perhaps it's the smudging, but I'd say this writing hews closer to the ancient text of the Chimer than the more recent Dark Elf style. Note the length of the brush strokes and broader spacing. This is very old indeed."
"15453358-0-419";"This is remarkable! Mortal text secreted away in a Daedric realm for gods know how long! I wager this dates back to the early years of the Tribunal. If I'm right, it means my theories of Dark Elven fire-retardant parchment are true!"
"15453358-0-420";"Most of this text is smeared and illegible. Like it got caught in a rain storm or washed away in a flood. For the longest time I thought the Deadlands was simply a blanket of fire that stretched in every direction. Seems it's a bit more complicated."
"15453358-0-421";"These pages are just shredded, eh? Looks like some hungry Daedroth mistook it for a juicy banekin. Still, there's quite a lot here. See the diagrams? I thought it was a rendering of Mehrunes' Razor, but it may be a different dagger entirely!"
"15453358-0-422";"This book is black as coal. Separating the ink from the ash may prove difficult. I suspect it will be worth the effort, though. Whoever wrote this was a Dark Elf of no small fortune. The quality of the materials is opulent by early Dark Elf standards."
"15453358-0-423";"No small amount of blood on this. Hard to tell if it's Daedric or mortal. Orc and Dremora blood stains the same. Same goes for Dark Elves, I wager. Just be wary about where you store these pages. Banekin can smell blood no matter how old it is."
"15453358-0-424";"See these notes in the margins? Looks like some Hexos treasure hunter got their hands on it for a bit. Couldn't have been long. The notes end here, near these fang-punctures. Can't tell if they came from an Ogrim or a Daedroth. Either way, it was fatal."
"15453358-0-425";"I can't imagine how these pages withstood centuries of exposure without being destroyed. They're lightly singed, granted. But on the whole, they seem almost untouched. They may have rested in some Dremora's treasure room for a time."
"15453358-0-426";"Someone put a lot of effort into trying to conceal this. Maybe they intended to dig it up again later? Unfortunately, the ground in the Deadlands never stays in one place for long. We're just lucky it didn't fall down a crevasse or burn in lava."
"15453358-0-427";"Sad to think that the person who wrote this likely never escaped. Personally, I'd love to explore the crags and gullies of a Daedric realm! Sure, the wheels of my chair would probably catch fire immediately, but nothing ventured nothing gained!"
"15453358-0-428";"You see the seal of the Tribunal in the margins here? It's a brave Elf would travel the Deadlands bearing a symbol like that. Mehrunes Dagon has many enemies, but I hear he hates Sotha Sil and Almalexia above all others."
"15453358-0-429";"Looks like an Ogrim used this as a table napkin. Luckily, some of the text remains. Diagrams of a sword, too. Those Ogrims are ugly beasts. Even so, it's hard to stay mad at them. They're sort of adorable, right? Just me? Fair enough."
"15453358-0-430";"This length of wood isn't naturally occurring. It's a knotted cane of some kind--hewn from one of the trees in the Ashen Forest, I suspect. I can't imagine there are many Dremora walking the Deadlands with a limp. And they don't grow old. Curious."
"15453358-0-431";"I don't recognize this heraldry. It's the work of Dremora, no question, but this clan doesn't appear in any of my Daedrology texts. I know there are potentially thousands of Dremora clans, but I thought we had a firm grasp of which clans serve Dagon."
"15453358-0-432";"Camilonwe's treatise on liminal bridges remains the foremost work on sigil stones, but there's still a lot we don't know. For instance, he explores the sigil process in great detail, but barely references how someone could acquire a morpholith to begin with. This enchanted chisel might be the key. Do you see these Daedric runes? Words like ""extract"" appear many times over, and its curvature seems perfect for working with spherical objects. Daedra might use this to excavate exotic morpholiths!"
"15453358-0-433";"Looks like a work-table--not for simple handicraft, though. Dremora must have used this for some arcane pursuit. See this unusual scoring here? Alchemy or Enchanting, I wager. You don't find this sort of thing in Tamriel. So much the better."
"15453358-0-434";"Call it macabre, but I just adore torture devices. Torture is abhorrent, of course! Even so, we can learn a great deal about a culture by examining their worst impulses. In the case of Daedra, that's practically all their impulses, but still. Fascinating."
"15453358-0-435";"This appears to be a map of Mehrunes Dagon's realm. Cosmic matters like the width and breadth of a Daedric realm are outside my area of expertise, but I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. The vellum it's made from is unsettling to say the least."
"15453358-0-436";"This isn't the product of Tamrielic hammer and tongs, I can tell you that. Looks like Obsidian at a distance. Ebony if you squint. But the metal's foreign. There's a grain to it, see? And these horns? Pulled from the head of some Daedric beast, I wager!"
"15453358-0-437";"The beveling on this horn doesn't appear natural. And you see the hole here at the bottom? I suspect someone attached this to something—a weapon or piece of armor. It might have acted as an offensive element or something to deflect blows."
"15453358-0-438";"Small rivets, eh? The Daedra do like their fasteners. I dare you to find a piece of Daedric armor that isn't blanketed in rivets, pins, and spikes. These seem special though. Ugron's the authority, but they look like they're made of voidsteel."
"15453358-0-439";"I must admit, the silhouette of these metal plates is quite fetching. Sleek lines, sharp corners, and simple, robust filigree. Pity that they're likely the product of some bloodthirsty Dremora's labors."
"15453358-0-440";"What a curious substance. This appears to be some sort of unguent or polish. Daedra do not place great emphasis on wound care, so I'm assuming it's the latter. Even more interestingly, this smells quite pleasant. Unlike any Dremora craft I've seen before."
"15453358-0-441";"Rugged. A little knobby. I'd bet this came off the back of a Clannfear. Those beasts are far smarter than people think. I doubt they'd take kindly to someone wearing the hide of one of their own. Still, it seems to make damn fine strapping."
"15453358-0-442";"This looks like part of a larger set. I don't recognize the symbols on the band, it's not any symbology I'm familiar with. It also looks rather tarnished. Like someone attempted to scratch the symbols out."
"15453358-0-443";"The Ruinblood clan is one of the most powerful Dremora clans that serve Mehrunes Dagon. You don't mess with these rascals! This coil definitely bears their symbol, but it looks like something was stacked on the top and bottom of it."
"15453358-0-444";"Looks like part of a ring. Not anything fancy--definitely not something made for ornamental purposes. I would say this is a piece of jewelry meant to signify rank. The symbols on the inside are definitely Daedric."
"15453358-0-445";"A ruby perhaps? Or something far darker. The Daedra use all manner of exotic stones in their work. I'm near certain this one does not exist on Nirn."
"15453358-0-446";"A ring, obviously, but what a strange material. Not quite metal, or at least not like any I've ever seen. It's quite old, but you can still make out the places where the shank itself was tapered, possibly where a stone was set?"
"15453358-0-447";"Looks like part of a ring to me. We don't really have the whole picture here, but I'll note that the craftsmanship on this is sturdier than your average piece of jewelry. This ring was constructed to withstand a great deal of punishment."
"15453358-0-448";"Well, this is a pretty thing, isn't it? The facets on this stone speak to an older gem-cutting technique. First Empire, maybe. Difficult to tell without the gallery rail. I thought it was a ruby at first, but now--you think this could be a diamond?"
"15453358-0-449";"The lack of corrosion here is quite remarkable, given the context. I'm told the Deadlands exacts a heavy toll on Tamrielic objects! This band is clearly of Imperial make, and not cheaply fashioned either. I doubt it made its way to Oblivion by mistake."
"15453358-0-450";"These are so cute! Are they tiny, little Xivilai horns? They could have come from a small statue, or maybe a piece of jewelry? Maybe some mortal sculptor in the Deadlands fancied them?"
"15453358-0-451";"This is incredibly well-preserved. Some kind of consecrated oil? Is it magical in origin? I can't imagine a vessel like this could survive the hardships of the Deadlands without arcane assistance."
"15453358-0-452";"Enchanters used this—of that I am certain. Note the configuration of this crystal apparatus. I do find it odd that the Daedra use enchanting methodology popular in Tamriel. Regrettably, magical concerns fall outside my area of expertise."
"15453358-0-453";"What's this? Daedra using runic magic? Mara's mercy, that is odd. Telenger's treatises on runic praxis reference several potential origins for runestones, but none of them extend into the realms of Oblivion! Runes transcending the veil? What a discovery!"
"15453358-0-460";"A remarkable find. This is a piece of a sabaton, or armored footwear. It appears Nord in origin, but the draconic embellishments are very unusual. I date it to the Nord Empire, fourth or fifth century 1E."
"15453358-0-461";"Articulated bands of ancient steel, likely Nord in origin. I believe these are the lames of a pair of sabatons, or armored boots. These bands protected the top of the wearer's foot."
"15453358-0-462";"This piece belongs to a First Era Nord sabaton of unusual design. The draconic embellishments suggest the wearer was a hero of high regard. But how it got to the Systres, I couldn't say."
"15453358-0-463";"Quite a find! This is a steel poleyn, or knee-plate, from an armored sabaton. The steel appears to be of Nord manufacture, First Era. However, I do not recognize the motif. I think it's supposed to represent a Dragon's face?"
"15453358-0-464";"I have never seen something quite like this. Clearly it's the shin-piece from sabatons of the highest quality, but I'm not sure it's even steel. I think these overlapping scale-like bits might be dragonhide!"
"15453358-0-465";"This has to be one of the most distasteful antiquities I've ever had to catalogue. It's still twitching. This tentacle matches the description of no living being on Nirn. Clearly a Daedric relic of some kind."
"15453358-0-466";"A most distressing relic, I must say. This thing is still leaking ocular fluid? It is not an eye from a mortal race, I can tell you that. Leaving further examination for colleagues with stronger stomachs."
"15453358-0-467";"Coils and coils of this thread, definitely made from the sinews of a Daedra.I sense an unpleasant warmth still radiating from the relic. Why a Seeker's corpse would be utilized in such a fashion is hard to fathom."
"15453358-0-468";"I believe this eyeball twitches to stare at me while I'm not looking. Unsettling, to say the least. Daedric origin, I believe, but which Daedra? Unsure."
"15453358-0-469";"This armor sheathing bears more than a passing resemblance to the skin of the creatures known as Lurkers. These beings serve the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora, and are rarely seen beyond the plane of Apocrypha."
"15453358-0-470";"I've only seen two other onyx gems like this--both in Na-Totambu tombs in Hammerfell. The sheer size is astounding, but its origins are far more exciting. To my knowledge, the only place onyxes like this can be found is Yokuda!"
"15453358-0-471";"These unique gems were considered a sign of royalty in Yokuda since before the rise of the Na-Totambu. It has something to do with the golden inclusions, I believe. The Yokudan's enemies, the Lefthanded Elves, embedded them in many of their weapons."
"15453358-0-472";"A golden disk? Without the other pieces, it's difficult to tell what it belonged to. Some kind of jewelry, I should think, but it's far too large for a crown or necklace. The inlays appear vaguely Yokudan, but different. Lefthander, perhaps?"
"15453358-0-473";"Well, this is a vicious looking accessory! Clearly some sort of snake skin, but I don't recognize the pattern. Looks a bit like those sep adders you find around Hew's Bane. Much bigger though! Maybe it's some giant, slithery cousin."
"15453358-0-474";"What a curious relic. It's a belt clasp, certainly, but the metal and configuration are quite unique. Do you see how it cinches from the left? This may have belonged to a Lefthander noble from ancient Yokuda!"
"15453358-0-475";"These bits of metal seem forged to resemble snake fangs. Never a good sign. I can't say for certain, but given the irregular finish and these scratches, I'd say they're a few hundred years old at least. Mid to late 1E, for certain."
"15453358-0-476";"What a delicate piece! Crafting links this small would be a laborious process, but the results speak for themselves. It's certainly Elven. Maormer, I should think, based on the pattern and the bluish hue of the silver."
"15453358-0-477";"Oh, black pearls! According to the Bedtime Tales of Borwaeliel, they're the result of Trinimac slicing off a handful of Hermaeus Mora's beady little eyes and scattering them across the Eltheric. So, be careful handling them!"
"15453358-0-478";"Don't often see beads hewn from meteoric glass. From my experience, the arcane potential of the glass has a lot to do with its physical dimensions. Based on the holes here, I'd say they were strung on a chain or thread to make some kind of necklace."
"15453358-0-479";"This stone is cold to the touch! Strange, considering I don't detect any frost-related enchantments. Gems infused with mystic spellcraft sometimes turn cold. No one knows why. It must have some power over perception or natural limitations."
"15453358-0-480";"You don't often see something like this. It looks like part of a ring, certainly, but it's not metallic. I've seen rings made from vines and bits of shell, but nothing like this. It's some sort of stone."
"15453358-0-481";"I've seen stones like this in High Rock, but rarely. It almost resembles turquoise, but brighter and creamier. Like a Topal Sea blue. Lovely! There must be more to it, though. You see these etchings? I don't recognize the shapes."
"15453358-0-482";"I adore gold jewelry, but this stone framing does have a rustic charm. The central groove seems ground down to accommodate a second loop. Even without the central element, though, it's lovely. And at least a thousand years old, I should think."
"15453358-0-483";"Given the age of this pouch, it's miraculous that this resin has retained its viscosity. Resin stored in this way could have a dozen uses--mostly medicinal, but also aesthetic. Khajiit on the Valenwood border sometimes use it as armor varnish."
"15453358-0-484";"These flakes of igneous rock are very delicate. Given the size and the patterning, I'd say an ancient jeweler used them as accent pieces in a ring or necklace. Their iridescence is quite fetching."
"15453358-0-485";"The color of the ink is curious. Either it's aged exceedingly poorly, or the author used a pigment made from crushed berries. Was this an attempt to appear close to the ancients he described or perhaps, more likely, a lack of funding?"
"15453358-0-486";"Triangles often appear in Breton art, but almost always in relation to Julianos. Perhaps the looping symbol etched on this book's cover is inspired by the God of Wisdom."
"15453358-0-487";"Do you see those sketches in the margins? It's an old symbol Druids still use as a mark of their combined circles. Finding that symbol outside of Druid lands probably means the site is from 330 1E. Possibly even older!"
"15453358-0-488";"I unearthed a lot of Breton archery tools outside the Crypt of Hearts, but I can't be sure I found anything like what this book describes. There was a drawing on the lower half of the page, but it didn't survive the perils of time."
"15453358-0-489";"Helvaine Ragon revolutionized Breton chest pieces in the First Era when the armies of Orsinium fought the Bjoulsae River Tribes. I wonder if this author found one of her sets of armor."
"15453358-0-490";"Strange. I've been delving into permits and records of expeditions leading into old Breton crypts and grave sites, but I haven't found any record of this author. Could these be findings from unsanctioned digs?"
"15453358-0-491";"I think there was something glued to the pages of this section, perhaps a swatch of the leather used to make the gloves? Regardless, the pages are bare of any added materials now, and all that remains is dreadfully sticky."
"15453358-0-492";"It looks like some pages were torn from the back of this book, but the text seems complete. Maybe there were diagrams too? Why anyone would tear pages from a book is beyond me."
"15453358-0-493";"See those little circles surrounding some words? You can tell they aren't original to the book since the ink is slightly darker. Whoever had this book was either very bored or took issue with the author's diction."
"15453358-0-494";"Whoever had this book before it was buried definitely didn't like the author's interpretations of the artifacts. See the notes in the margin? They seem more frustrated with each line! No wonder the owner tossed it to the wayside."
"15453358-0-495";"I had to carefully wipe the dirt off these pages before I could make out the words. Whoever buried this book, did it with purpose. I can barely move it without releasing dirt onto my reading table."
"15453358-0-496";"The drawings on these pages appears to match the style of master artisan Rumlirdilmo. His later work seemed oddly Breton-inspired. I'll have to compare these against his sketch books."
"15453358-0-497";"Our library has accounts and even a few manuals on how the druids and Breton mages of old made their staffs. The other books are organized from completely fabricated assumptions to factual guides. I wonder where this one falls."
"15453358-0-498";"There are rumors that Breton warriors used to put skyshard slivers in the hilts of their swords. I was really hoping this book would confirm that theory or offer a new insight. Oh well, perhaps the next one will have some answers for me."
"15453358-0-499";"By the look and make of this, I'd say it's druidic. Something used in cooking, perhaps, given the markings on the bottom. The elk could be a depiction of one of the lesser spirits revered by druids, Una the Green Elk."
"15453358-0-500";"Druidic artifacts are not my area of expertise, but I think it's quite hard to argue that this is of druid make. While the mortar is long gone, I believe this pestle was used for food stuffs rather than any magic or poultices. The design is thinner."
"15453358-0-501";"I've seen these before, I believe it's a very old cooking instrument. It has ridges on the side as if it once fit in to a larger piece. I am not sure I have ever encountered anything that would satisfy, but it certainly is an interesting puzzle."
"15453358-0-502";"The base of this strange pot has a hollow compartment. I believe this is where grain was stored. The top half acts as a grinder, so that the grain can be made into a paste with relative ease. A very smart druidic invention. Fascinating!"
"15453358-0-503";"It's hard to tell, given that we only have the spout to what I imagine was once a kettle, but if you look closely the engravings tell quite a story! If I'm not mistaken, this spout is decorated with symbols of Y'ffre--or the Green Man, rather."
"15453358-0-504";"The craftsmanship on this piece is quite stunning, and remarkably well preserved. It would not take an expert to know that this is some kind of strainer. The holes are carefully placed. But a keen eye like mine also spotted the druidic style of weaving."
"15453358-0-505";"This appears to be part of a larger whole. The pieces on the top and bottom seem jagged, as if broken apart, but the chamber itself remains intact. The scorchmarks indicate this was perhaps some kind of small oven? Maybe it served other functions."
"15453358-0-506";"At first glance, this looks like nothing more than a butcher's block, but it was clearly attached to something else. It seems like a platform—something that had a foundation. For stability? The knife marks in it are deep, it was obviously well used."
"15453358-0-507";"One might think this was a broom made for exceptionally small people. It is indeed fashioned like a broom, but you can tell by the softness of the bristles (even after all this time) that it was more likely used for blending ingredients."
"15453358-0-508";"Druids of old often tempered their clay with wood ash and plant fibers. I think this is one such example. With the sheer width of the bottom of this pitcher, I would guess it was used to cool extremely hot liquids during cooking."
"15453358-0-509";"I nearly missed it, but there's a prayer to an Elk of Arrows woven into this cowl. Given the location and age, I would argue this cowl is evidence of overlap between the druid's True Way and Reach theology. Don't balk! Hircine and the druids actually have quite a bit in common. What is more willful and valuable in nature than the relationship between hunter and hunted? The natural cycle of life and death is Y'ffre's will too!"
"15453358-0-510";"You wouldn't expect a bunch of vinebeards to be master stonecutters, but the druids really knew how to work a chisel. You find megaliths like this all over the Systres, but this one is in particularly good shape."
"15453358-0-511";"A fascinating design, not something you're likely to see in a Tamrielic navy, obviously. Its origin is no doubt Pyandonea, the home of the Sea Elves. Though, it's worth noting, their designs tend to be more pragmatic than this extravagant piece."
"15453358-0-512";"This looks to be a map of High Isle, but there are some ports I've never heard of. Rockroost? Castle Notte? I'll study it more closely, but that may take some time. The parchment is very thin and weathered. This map must be exceedingly old."
"15453358-0-513";"A solid piece made of brass and other metals, I date this to the era of the Breton Coinlords. Say 1E 2330, give or take a decade. A well-preserved if unremarkable example of that period in history."
"15453358-0-514";"An excellent find. An early example of druidic craftsmanship from the Systres Archipelago, I think. You can tell based on the knotwork around the edges, wyrd symbology from elsewhere uses entirely different patterns."
"15453358-0-515";"A funerary urn made of purest orichalcum, tooled in a style I have seen only rarely. The runes are clearly not of the Tamrielic continent, and the imagery makes heavy use of winged figures. To answer your inquiry, Ugron, without opening it I cannot in good concious say whether this is a burial urn for the fabled Sinistral Elves. I have contacted famed researcher Trilam Heladren at the University of Gwylim for consultation."
"15453358-0-517";"Finding a Sload artifact this far from their ritual pits is certainly strange. But then, it came from a dig site on Galen. The residual energy is unmistakable in origin. Perhaps a member of the All Flags Navy brought it back from Thras?"
"15453358-0-518";"A fine example of druidic craft just post-diaspora, if I'm not mistaken. These flat stones each bear a single rune, though I confess I'm unfamiliar with this particular sigil."
"15453358-0-519";"Notice the delicately embossed Allessian crest near the throat and the fine detail work at its chape. While every captain was gifted a treated leather scabbard, to find one in such great condition is only the first hurdle. After the loss of nearly half the fleet, the remaining All Flags Navy captains signed the Concordat of Fraternity and pledged their sailors to the cause of peace. Part of this pledge included the symbolic destruction of their swords, scabbards included."
"15453358-0-520";"Ooh, I don't recognize this material! It feels much different than your standard leather or hide, there's a toughness to it but it's also incredibly supple. It's almost otherworldly! Do you think it could be something Daedric?"
"15453358-0-521";"Are these...garlic bulbs? They're nearly petrified but if they've held their shape reliably I can think of no other explanation. And the other components must be some kind of pepper, or root, by that logic."
"15453358-0-522";"The markings in this fabric almost look like runes. I don't recognize any of the symbols. Perhaps it's a language? But with the five of us, I feel as though we'd be hard pressed to find something we weren't at least tangentially aware of."
"15453358-0-523";"These clasps are so shiny! At first, I was sure they were silver or some kind of polished metal, but as soon as I held them I knew I was wrong. They're so light, they almost feel hollow! The carvings are so intricate but the material hasn't weakened."
"15453358-0-524";"This fur is incredible coarse. It feels almost like horse tail, but the way it's layered is much closer to that of a wolf or a beast of the north. The harshness of it almost acts as armor."
"15453358-0-525";"Knots and twisted lines mean more to the druids than almost any other group, but this symbol isn't used very often. I think this is the sign for the True Way. If druids follow the True Way, they'll please Y'ffre. Maybe that's why the wear the symbol."
"15453358-0-526";"Druids put more intention behind their knots and twisted cords than almost any other group on Nirn. With the two distinct knots on the rope, I suspect it harkens back to the Breton's history as hailing from both man and mer."
"15453358-0-527";"So many tassels and chains of braided leather. I heard some druids braid their blessing and prayers into their leatherwork. Three strands, three circles. Perhaps there is something there."
"15453358-0-528";"Hmm, these look similar to the branch-like growths of the forest wraiths. Given the druid circles' connection to the wraith, I wonder if these were harvested from slain wraiths or given freely."
"15453358-0-529";"I've heard of this pattern, the translations call it the Knots of Earthbones. Myths abound about Y'ffre's body turning into the very foundation of Nirn."
"15453358-0-530";"How unusual, a belt buckle made of buoyant steel. Perhaps intended for a sailor's belt? The properties of frog metal are well documented, though its origins are still a bit murky."
"15453358-0-531";"Thread made of silver is not all that uncommon, especially in the workshops of magic-minded craftsfolk. But the skill with which this has been spun is breathtaking. It reminds me of the jewelry worn by Sapiarchs, actually."
"15453358-0-532";"How intriguing, this pot contains a blend of sea water (Eltheric, I believe) and ground pearl. Leaves such a delightful sheen on materials when applied. Do you think it was ceremonial or mystical in nature?"
"15453358-0-533";"These brackets are made up a few different metals, and sized for a belt of some kind. Interesting, if a bit of over kill. Why would you need multiforging techniques to brace something that holds up your breeches?"
"15453358-0-534";"I'm not even sure where to start. It took a great deal of research to even determine the beast of origin. I was very surprised to learn it's Indrik hide. Not a material you regularly find in the finest of clothing, let alone used as a humble belt strap."
"15453358-0-535";"Odd. The shape of Y'ffelon is akin to modern charts, but there's just as much druid influence on this map as there is mainland Breton. It's as if there were two cartographers, both given equal input. A married couple, perhaps?"
"15453358-0-536";"To think a digsite amidst strong volcanic activity could produce such a wonderful specimen! We know so little about the Vulk'esh, perhaps this petrified egg will be an opportunity for novel study."
"15453358-0-537";"Interesting, you don't often see this kind of wood outside of a shipyard. But I can see the logic behind using it for a drafting surface. The material is sturdy, can withstand any weather, and as you can see with your own eyes, it'll last a lifetime."
"15453358-0-538";"Most puzzling. Druidic in origin, but the box has no discernible hinges, keyhole, or opening. When I hold it in my hands, I swear I can feel something alive scuttling around inside of it. What could its purpose be?"
"15453358-0-539";"These pages are worn by time and fragile as leaves. Perhaps the faded drawings just inspire the comparison. What's more, the druidic runes on the page are subtly different than those associated with any of the three druid circles. Fascinating."
"15453358-0-540";"Ashamed to say that I almost dropped this. I felt it beat in my hand, like it was alive. Yes, it's anatomically correct, but it's made of hardened tree sap. Outside of druidic magic, I can't fathom how or why someone would make such a thing."
"15453358-0-541";"There's a spell carved here! Definitely druidic, and mentions something about donning the ""skin of the forest."" Does the pattern on the other side look like a face to you, too? I swear it kept flashing me an impish grin out of the corner of my eye."
"15453358-0-542";"I've seen wheels like this in the crushing tombs in Alik'r Desert. Granted, those wheels were larger and their grooves were deep from use. This plate spun though, that much I can confirm just from the way it's fashioned."
"15453358-0-543";"Here we see a representation of the impressive architectural techniques of the druids. Their homes are conical-shaped to help regulate temperatures on hot days."
"15453358-0-544";"The song inscribed on the drum wheel sounds familiar. I think it's 'Streaming Flags of Northsalt' but there's an extra line in the melody that doesn't align with how mother sang it."
"15453358-0-545";"Oh, copper! Mages on mainland Tamriel use it to detect magic, so I wonder if its used in the Systres to detect ammonites. If that's the case, perhaps this music box has some magical properties."
"15453358-0-546";"A comb from a music box and it's not even a little rusted. I must confess that I started plucking at it while I cataloged this find. The notes are clear and crisp, it probably makes a delightful sound when played with intention."
"15453358-0-547";"Judging by the depictions of the enormous skeletons, this must be a map of Fargrave. It's a little disjointed. The Plaza of Portals are depicted, but the rest of the points on the map seem to defy my very gaze. It's disorienting, to say the least."
"15453358-0-548";"Now this is sturdy craftsmanship. Judging by the age, I'd say this was put together some time after the signing of the Concordat of Fraternity. A good deal of Breton workers brought their families to High Isle and put down roots in the shipyards then."
"15453358-0-549";"See the hinges on the side? It must have been attached to a larger piece, looking at the size of bolts. It looks Breton in design, but I'm not sure what the purpose was. Something for cooking, perhaps?"
"15453358-0-550";"Detailed analysis suggests this clay was excavated from beneath one of the stone circles in the heart of Galen. Druidic practices make regular call for dolmen clay in rituals from the mundane to the fantastic."
"15453358-0-551";"A carved wooden handle, oak from the deep vales of Galen. I have no doubt. More intriguing is the hair! Chimera, I believe. A possible leap, but look how its warp and weft is so consistent? Subtly different than a lion's mane, which is the tip-off."
"15453358-0-552";"Unpleasant, but well worth the discomfort. Clings to skin with a subtle grip, and spreads itself out over a human body if given the chance. Living ritual implements like this have been rumored for years, but this was my first chance to study one."
"15453358-0-553";"A solid clod of material with a rich aroma, druids from Galen make use of this mulch in tending to their precious herb gardens. When mixed with other ritual materials it could prove a potent activator, potentially unleashing hidden potential."
"15453358-0-554";"Through alchemical and magical means this bark has been harvested in a still-living state. You could plant this in the ground and grown a whole stand of trees, if you were so inclined. I can only guess at its ritual purpose for the druids."
"15453358-0-555";"These little budlings are still alive, believe it or not. This moss is called ""Grove Carpet"" by Galen druids. Practically indestructible in bud form. Sprinkle even ancient budlings in some water and you'll have a lush plant in a matter of days."
"15453358-0-556";"A vibrant pigment, but not the reds or oranges you might expect from the beautiful phoenix moth. This deep brownish hue comes from crushing the moth pupae, a ritualistically completed act done in preparation of some Galen rituals."
"15453358-0-557";"An extremely ornate inner garment, I've never seen this level of care and detail given to an early Tribunal era weave like this. Whoever this was made for must have played an incredibly influential role in the region."
"15453358-0-558";"I've seen natural kwama materials used in thousands of different ways, and the scrib chitin shaped for these pieces was done by a master artisan. I suspect a student of the Saruse school of ashlands materials shaping."
"15453358-0-559";"A simple clerical stole in the Velothi style, but with a unique shape language and exquisite craftsmanship. I've seen hundreds of examples of these kinds of garments, and this is a wholly singular piece. No doubt a priest of great esteem."
"15453358-0-560";"What an ingenious use of natural materials. These clasps were carved from netch beaks, each interlocking set at a time, the small toothsome ridges used to hold and keep the hooked fasteners in place. Delightful."
"15453358-0-561";"By far the most ostentatious sash I've ever laid eyes upon. Crafted in traditional Velothi style, but with materials and a level of care far beyond what I'd expect from a simple clergy's garb."
"15453358-0-562";"I understand why this came straight to my desk, clearly Dwemer in origin. Fairly standard construction, but the surface feels texturally quite different. I suggest one of my more experimental colleagues test its properties."
"15453358-0-563";"A belt of unusual properties. An accident in one of the storage rooms destroyed a number of relics by fire. This simple loop was covered with ash but untouched otherwise. I would have put this in the ephemera file otherwise, fascinating."
"15453358-0-564";"Exhilarating. This appears to be a set of breeches crafted with materials and techniques common to the Sload of Thras. But symbology, treatment, and context all scream Dwemer. I've never seen such clear evidence of collaboration between these cultures."
"15453358-0-565";"These pivot points remind me strongly of those we've seen on constructs from across traditional Dwemer regions. But they're sized for a flesh and blood wearer, perhaps part of some armor? A standout relic of their culture."
"15453358-0-566";"I've never seen this before. Daedric scales culled and cured by what looks like Nirn techniques? What culture would cultivate a Daedra for their skin, and use them in a set of greaves?"
"15453358-0-567";"A wide silk ribbon, such as you might use for a medal. There is a faint pattern woven into the silk, showing birds in flight. It seems to be ancestor silk, but I haven't seen its like."
"15453358-0-568";"Interesting. This appears to be the hook or ring that secured an amulet to its chain. As you can see, it's shaped like an eagle's talon. Altmeri, I think. But I don't recognize the metal."
"15453358-0-569";"Good metal, this.  The Ayleids were masters of meteoric iron and crafted many fine blades from it. But I do not think this was part of a weapon. What is the significance of these interlocking rings?"
"15453358-0-570";"Here we see an example of Ayleid jewelcraft at its best. This is the mounting for a large stone, unfortunately missing. If meteoric iron was the servant of the Ayleids, palladium was their delight."
"15453358-0-571";"Judging by its size and cut, this jewel was the center of a large piece such as a medallion or a crown. Its innate magicka gives it that striking color. Could it be an Ayleid welkynd crystal?"
"15453358-0-572";"Ebony is a notoriously difficult material to work. But here the jewelsmith produced hundreds of fine links, interlocked in a martial pattern of tiny crossed swords. Ancient Dark Elf work, I think."
"15453358-0-573";"These curious prongs represent the mandibles of a large beetle, perhaps a shalk. It's a common design element in Dark Elf jewelry. This cradle secured a gemstone to a pendant or amulet."
"15453358-0-574";"How lovely and clever! The mandibles of this shalk-beetle chain clasp close and lock to secure a fine chain. The shalk is rendered in a beautiful red-hued gold. Something from Morrowind, I suppose."
"15453358-0-575";"Ah. An amulet in the form of an ebony shalk-beetle, although it's missing the gemstone and the prongs or bridge that would have secured it. Clearly Dark Elf work, but old. Very old."
"15453358-0-576";"A strange, luminous gemstone unlike any I have seen before. The rounded face and flat back suggest it was once mounted on something like a pendant or amulet."
"15453358-0-577";"This is curious. Definitely First Era, maybe soon after Veloth led the Chimer here. Note that the coastlines are very well-defined, but when we get into the interior regions the mapping becomes much more sketchy."
"15453358-0-578";"Obviously a candle, probably made of yellow beeswax, set in a glass container, used as an offering to the dead. Not surprising given the proximity to Necrom, a city devoted to the Dark Elf ancestors."
"15453358-0-579";"Hah! This vase was definitely used as a mixing vessel for water and wine. This figure portrays Veloth the Pilgrim, who led the Chimer out of Summerset, either in the Dawn Era or the Late Middle Merethic. Good find!"
"15453358-0-580";"An excellent find! This vestment considers of a cloth undercoat covered with unique silks, reinforced with ornamental beads. Probably the ceremonial robe used by a pre-Tribunal priest. Did this belong to traveling clergy? Or, as was so common in the past, was it something robbed from a tomb and used as a trade good? Either way, a fascinating look into early Dark Elf religious iconography."
"15453358-0-581";"Craftsmen in Vivec City started grinding dried funnelcap mushrooms into paste around 100 2E. The paint is deceptively simple to make for how potent it is. I'd be careful, it tends to stain."
"15453358-0-582";"I expected sporecrafters to rely exclusively on fungal agents, but this marking uses pigment made from beetles. Perhaps the design demanded a darker palate or perhaps the designers of this marking wanted to pay homage to decomposers."
"15453358-0-583";"I know this powder; you see that bright yellow all over battlefields after the fighting is done. Bloodtooth mushrooms feast on the carnage, but as their supply of blood withers their spores change from red to yellow."
"15453358-0-584";"I read a few accounts where the sporecrafters plucked milkcaps right out of the ground to make perfectly spherical dots. They'd plant the milkcaps again. And if the mushrooms survived, then the next harvest would be a good one."
"15453358-0-585";"The shapes used here look like they're emulating the netch shield mushroom. I don't always understand plant names. Why is a mushroom a better defense than an actual shield?"
"15453358-0-586";"Sporecrafters used their fingers to paint their designs, but that made the designs less uniform. Around the end of the 1st Era, they started growing stamps and brushes out of mushrooms like this one. Pretty innovative if you ask me."
"15453358-0-587";"A disagreement between opinionated Dark Elves discussing whether it was more appropriate to use funnelcap or flapjack pigment for their body paints. I suspect that most sporecrafters likely use whichever mushroom is at their disposal."
"15453358-0-588";"Well, this is a winding mechanism if I ever saw one. But what does it wind? I've seen something similar used for drum heads, but this one is so delicate."
"15453358-0-589";"A giant's handful of metal cubes. All the same size. What purpose do these serve? And, yes, they're crafted from wispmetal. Are these cubes used in some sort of Apocrypha game that servitors of Mora play when not finding obscure lore?"
"15453358-0-591";"It looks like the Sporecrafters use puspocket powder in their paints. Some folklore says these mushrooms have soporific capabilities, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Still, not something I'd slather around my eyes."
"15453358-0-592";"I suspected the Sporecrafters used setting sap. I've never seen it made from mushrooms, but their secretions can keep paint from spreading or fading. It's valuable when you need to preserve warpaint."
"15453358-0-593";"I can't even get the paint I put on my eyelids for special occasions to match, but the Sporecrafters solved that problem. They use these little stones to transfer the paint to their faces. It's perfectly even on both sides!"
"15453358-0-594";"Paint runs. It smudges and smears if your hand twitches or is anything less than perfect. These little spongecap mushrooms are more practical for wiping away access paint than cloth. Who cares if mushrooms get stained."
"15453358-0-595";"Cultures throughout Tamriel use grinding stones to crush dried plant matter to dust. Whoever used these, had them for a long time, see how smooth the rock faces are? It's likely that these were heirlooms, passed down between the generations."
"15453358-0-596";"Drying twine can either be completely innocuous or something that's imbued with strong magical properties. Sporecrafters can sometimes put spells on the twine to help leech moisture from their mushrooms and speed up the process."
"15453358-0-597";"Don't be deceived with how simple this purse appears, the stitching along the drawstring reveals a powerful inscription. It's a blessing of dirt and decay, a recognition of the end all mortals face. Macabre to be carrying around on a daily basis."
"15453358-0-598";"This has to be the finest form of Apocryphal wispmetal I've ever seen! It's almost like a fabric. A weighty fabric. But it's such a small swatch. It must have covered something sacred."
"15453358-0-599";"Well, well - a darklight gemstone. These give off a light that makes unseen colors glow. Explorers in Apocrypha once used a special chalk to mark their way through book mazes, then used these stones to make their formerly invisible marks visible."
"15453358-0-600";"What's a mechanical device without springs? But to make them from Apocryphal wispmetal seems a bit much when normal springs would work. Seems like they sought to match metals throughout the device."
"15453358-0-601";"Intriguing. This map purports to be of Apocrypha, but while the major locations, like Cipher's Midden, are there, they're in different locations. Perhaps this was done by someone with second-hand information?"
"15453358-0-602";"An absolutely fantastic find, and surprisingly well preserved. Some of the mushrooms detailed in this tome haven't been seen in centuries. I must fight the urge to flip through its pages on account of how delicate they are."
"15453358-0-603";"The fossilization process has captured, in exquisite detail, the intricate internal structure of this mysterious creature. But, one question still nags at me. What is the original organic material? Surely bone would've been far too cumbersome."
"15453358-0-604";"I wish you could've heard the scream I let out when the team uncovered this monstrous fossil. Joy and disgust in equal measure. I'm not quite sure where to begin with this specimen. Its bone breaking mandibles or its terrifying enormity."
"15453358-0-605";"How curious it is to find that Apocrypha is littered with these nautilus fossil structures. The creature itself is common enough in the seas west of Tamriel, but nowhere near the size we're finding in Apocrypha."
"15453358-0-606";"Immediately one must take note of the segmented nature of this fossil. I'm inclined to believe this is a tail, with the curled horns at its end acting as some sort of defensive structure. I hope to find more of this creature nearby."
"15453358-0-607";"The Cliff Strider has always occupied my curiosity since I was a child. The power of a reptile made all the more deadly by its gift of flight. This exquisite specimen is the first step towards my full dive into Cliff Strider taxonomy."
"15453358-0-608";"Ugron, you should've seen how my hands trembled when I held this stunning piece of glass artistry. It is so easy to lose yourself in its deep blue hues. Perhaps they used a pigment made from Stoneflower petals and Black Anther? Remarkable."
"15453358-0-609";"Strange.  A base fragment of larger column that broke away at some point. The most obvious curiosity is the dark liquid pool at its center. I attempted to drain away the fluid, but it filled itself up to the previous level."
"15453358-0-610";"Adding more pieces to this artifact has awoken a swirling mass above the well's pool. I don't feel it poses a threat, but it's certainly uncomfortable to witness. Perhaps one of you could explain this effect."
"15453358-0-611";"Unlike the swirling mass, these tendrils are quite real. This well creates a small puncture in the skin between us and Oblivion. So far, the tendrils appear relatively docile. You know, for otherworldly tendrils."
"15453358-0-612";"Such roiling darkness should not hold its shape like this, yet here it is. How could one even transport this piece? Based on the shadowy composition, I'd estimate an association with the Daedric Prince Namira."
"15453358-0-613";"Quite obvious that we're not dealing with typical glass! I can't determine from this fragment whether it's just an illusion, or if it provides a stable portal. Though, I think a permanent entrance into Oblivion would be quite dangerous."
"15453358-0-614";"The stone legs are curious. You commonly see shaped sandstone among Dwarven construction, but the runes are Daedric. Could this be evidence that some Dwemer consorted with creatures from Oblivion? What a find!"
"15453358-0-615";"This provides quick, even heating for large-batch mixtures. The sand is from Morrowind, but I would guess Saint Vorys brought this method back following his march on Elsweyr. Baandari have used sand baths to make tea and coffee since the late first era."
"15453358-0-616";"A bit of a misnomer--these are made from hard metals, not stone. Rotation speed is indicated in Old Aldmeris, and the runework is like nothing I've ever seen. So delicate and precise, still working after all these years! I used one to stir my tea."
"15453358-0-617";"The Telvanni that used this weren't the type to throw bundles of foraged reagents in, say, a craft bag or something. The dividers indicate every precaution taken to prevent cross-contamination of reagents. Very focused on high potency and yield."
"15453358-0-618";"My alchemist consult said the metal is practically non-reactive, but my jeweler friend reacted quite strongly upon examining it. If this funnel were any more luxurious, it'd be crusted with rubies. It's pure platinum, late first era."
"15453358-0-619";"This is an ancient Nord design from early first era, likely reclaimed when Nords were driven from present-day Morrowind. Sturdy, dependable piece. The only alteration made by subsequent users is an added spout for pouring."
"15453358-0-620";"Fascinating. This is Ashlander in origin! Only Ashlanders know how to properly season and enchant this porous rock to eliminate cross-contamination between use. Cleaning it wrong could spell disaster. Best of luck with it!"
"15453358-0-621";"Impurities make this easily traceable to Azura's Coast, early second era. Useful in storing and preserving certain low-humidity solvents and reagents--it keeps dry things dry. I've owned one myself for many years. It's where I keep my sense of humor."
"15453358-0-622";"Incredibly common sublimation tool, similar to an alembic. I suspect this one is Dwemer in origin from the choice in brass over copper, a superior heat conductor. A tempered retort, on the other hand, is something one hears form Verita on a daily basis."
"15453358-0-623";"Very sturdy material. No surprise how this has remained intact after all these years. It's used for precise titration of extremely potent mixtures, but unfortunately, residue trapped in the stopcock suggests that it was last used to manufacture skooma."
"15453358-0-624";"Remarkably useful for filtering out alchemical impurities. I've read historical accounts of the ancient vacuum bellows being operated by lowly assistants or slaves. Better a bellows than being asked to use one's own breath, I suppose."
"15453358-0-625";"If I didn't know better, I'd have said the artisan who crafted this box used a dark stain to get this unique color. But no, this is inkwood straight from Apocrypha. What did it contain, though?"
"15453358-0-626";"The etchings on this cylinder indicate an arcanist prepared it. But they don't look like any I've run into before. Perhaps they indicate a form of runic magic I'm not aware of. Regardless, the dark metal acts as if imbued."
"15453358-0-627";"The runeforms on this strange metal comb are all the same. And they all seem to set off some form of arcanist's magic. So, a triggering comb? Definitely not something for hair. And it's definitely made from wispmetal."
"15453358-0-628";"Why would anyone make gears out of green calcite? It's such a soft mineral. But perhaps this rich mauve sheen strengthens it enough to make it a worthwhile material for gears. My ruby won't scratch it."
"15453358-0-629";"No questions about this one. It's a grooved shaft that one uses to tighten or loosen something. What would this have opened ... or closed? A tomb maybe? And it's crafted from wispmetal - a rare Apocrypha metal."
"15453358-0-630";"Given the lack of birds and other feathered species in Apocrypha, the ancient scholars of Hermaeus Mora used seeker claws in place of traditional quills. Their sharp points, deadly while alive, would have made for excellent writing instruments."
"15453358-0-631";"A vial of ink produced by a watcher. A precious material, not lightly given to a mortal. Even Hermaeus Mora's most faithful followers. This small amount could have been carried as a sign of an arcanist's commitment."
"15453358-0-632";"This is a rare find! I've never seen vestments quite like these before. My guess is this ancient stole was worn by Hermaeus Mora's faithful servants. Every detail has been accounted for. Typical of ciphers. Hidden pockets for quills, vials of ink, and even sheaves of paper. The material is dark, likely to hide ink stains from fevered writing and research. I can faintly see where there were once embroidered tentacles on the cloth, representing commitment to Mora's service."
"15453358-0-633";"A surprisingly well preserved arch from the heart of Reaper's March. You can still see a few claw markings at the base and again at the top of the curvature."
"15453358-0-634";"Breton architecture and its infatuation with pointed arches have always intrigued me. Perhaps a residual element of Direnni cultural elements still making themselves known in their design?"
"15453358-0-635";"An archetypal carving of sorts, representing some mytho-historical concept in Yokudan storytelling. Most likely something you would find in a dungeon or tomb, if my last visit to Hammerfell gives me any insight."
"15453358-0-636";"An exceptional example of the sacred architecture seen in Morrowind ancestor worship. The red cloth acts as a resting place for idols, a vibrant space for one's predecessors to luxuriate."
"15453358-0-637";"How beautiful. Perhaps this is a cultural piece of artistry to accompany performances on the Vossa-satl, or Frog-Pipes."
"15453358-0-638";"Clearly a shrine, most likely to Dibella, but whatever statue or effigy lay at the center is long since gone."
"15453358-0-639";"I love when we get to examine a Clockwork City artifact. The mechanisms here are structural, meant to allow two distinct sub-areas of a construct to work together."
"15453358-0-640";"High Elf craftsmanship at its finest. The crystal has to be more than just a decoration, no?"
"15453358-0-641";"An antique, but one still used today. These massive vessels serve to holdfast what little water falls in the arid region of Elsweyr."
"15453358-0-642";"A beautiful example of rural Khajiiti architecture. We normally focus on their impressive temples, it's sometimes pleasant to focus on the day-to-day."
"15453358-0-643";"Black soul gems. A cruel way of entrapping mortal souls. Don't worry, I've made sure they are empty."
"15453358-0-644";"This unique cachet of currency from the Infinite Archive is curious in the extreme. The preoccupation of Daedra with these eyeball-focused signets is worth extensive study."
"15453358-0-645";"A large purse of soul-forged currency. Traded by the Daedra and scholars of the Infinite Archive. Magickal analysis clearly indicates the presence of soul gems in the stamping of these signets, and I can only guess at where this font of mystic power originates."
"15453358-0-646";"A substantial satchel of the currency traded by the hierophant of the Infinite Archive. My investigation implies a direct causal link between understanding of the aetheric index at the heart of the Archive and obtaining these iconic signets. Perhaps the reason for their value within the enclosed space that is that realm."
"15453358-0-647";"The craftsmanship is exquisite. Almost has me believing that these tentacles actually move."
"15453358-0-648";"While my knowledge in fabrics leaves much to be desired, I examined each strand of fabric and discovered something curious. Any guesses?"
"15453358-0-649";"These tentacles seem to be working together for a stronger grip, forming a tendril of sorts … but to carve and bend materials in such a manner."
"15453358-0-650";"Mora's markings are of course instantly recognizable, but these pedals at the base stick out like a sorcerer's staff."
"15453358-0-651";"Apocrypha's everlasting green illumination is one phenomenon I've always debated: magicka, or soul energy?"
"15453358-0-652";"Interesting. The stone carving appears to depict the tentacles of Hermaeus Mora or his watchers. This motif is often seen in artifacts from Apocrypha. Upon closer inspection, it looks to be a fragment of a larger piece."
"15453358-0-653";"The residual arcane energy trapped within this stone clearly marks it as Apocryphal in origin. It is an ornate carving, perhaps it was used as an altar or ritual site by ancient denizens of Apocrypha?"
"15453358-0-654";"What a stunning engraving! The iconic hourglass pupil of Hermaeus Mora is clearly visible in the stone eye at the center. Mora's image never appears idly, this artifact would have had an important purpose to his followers."
"15453358-0-655";"Ah, it appears someone treated this book very poorly in the past. This looks to be the torn cover of a book of arcane knowledge. It's a historian's worst nightmare, actually. What I wouldn't give to have the rest of the text!"
"15453358-0-656";"The course of history can often be traced to the contents of one single page. In typical Apocrypha style, the contents of this page seem to be encoded, but from the format of the information, it looks to be an index or reference of some sort."
"15453358-0-657";"This manuscript looks so naked without a cover! I'm surprised it's fared this well over the years without added protection. Though, I suppose, the watcher ink text would be resilient to the elemental forces of Apocrypha."
"15453358-0-658";"Ah, an arcane light source. This would have been perfect for reading in the strange atmosphere of Apocrypha and lighting up dark archives. I can't determine why it would need so many different colors, though."
"15453358-0-659";"I've yet to deduce the meaning behind the symbols rising from this arcane fire."
"15453358-0-660";"Who knew Mora could be so cruel to his own eyes that serve him."
"15453358-0-661";"Entry 1: On one of my personal travels, I happened to discover a small light of sorts. It seems to pulsate whenever I hover it over my books, specifically that detail Apocrypha."
"15453358-0-662";"A facsimile, clearly. But so well made it's clear the forger had access to an original during the creation process. Why would anyone make such a thing? And how? And why?"
"15453358-0-663";"A product only of Apocrypha, clearly. But perhaps it serves some other function? The tentacles are deeply unnerving."
"15453358-0-664";"Is this alive? Does this hold a mind and will of its own? Or is it merely an extension of the Inevitable Knower?"
"15453358-0-665";"Clearly the fossilized remains of a large creature that once lived in ancient Apocrypha. The elongated spine denotes a serpentine biology. The creature likely moved without the use of legs."
"15453358-0-666";"Ugh, how did I get stuck with this one? Obviously this was a slug of enormous size. It probably ate anything it came across and left a disgusting slime trail behind it. Need I say more?"
"15453358-0-667";"What a bizarre find! At one point this looks like it was part of an ancient ruin, an arcane sanctum. Mora's ancient ciphers likely used it as an entrance to a safehouse for knowledge and research, perhaps before the establishment of Cipher's Midden."
"15453358-0-668";"Fascinating, this looks to be a rare instance of recognizable plant matter from Apocrypha. It is a very strange tree. It must have been grown early in the history of Apocrypha, before the ecology became so saturated with arcane energy."
"15453358-0-669";"How lovely! I don't recognize the pattern, but I think these gloves are very old. This is wamasu-hide, magically cured. Wamasu are native to Black Marsh, but the design looks Elven. The Barsaebic Ayleids, perhaps?"
"15453358-0-670";"Ah, an aetheric fragment! There are many varieties, of course. Welkynd stones, varla stones, skyshards, and more. All are very rare, and very valuable. I am not sure I know this particular type."
"15453358-0-671";"Interesting. These fine tools are gravers, picks used for etching fine designs in metal or stone. They're made of Dwarven metal, which makes sense. You need a very hard metal to scratch another metal. What was made with them, I wonder?"
"15453358-0-672";"Armor plate, articulated, made of dwarven metal. I think it must be a piece of a Dwemer animunculi, an animated machine used for labor or for war. Beyond that, I can't say."
"15453358-0-673";"I confess, I am not sure what to make of this. It appears to be a series of hoops or pipes made from dwarven metal, connected in the center by a piston-like mechanism. I suspect it is a decorative element or embellishment for a Dwemer animunculi."
"15453358-0-674";"This stitching is so light, so thin. Under normal circumstances I would assume it was used in creating a nobleman's wardrobe. Someone with money to spend who doesn't care about durability. But this substance seems quite magical. Amalien?"
"15453358-0-675";"There are runes etched into the soft leather that look like others I've seen from the Hunting Grounds. I consulted Runes and Daedric Symbols by Zirpar Giralvel and discovered that these runes promise the wearer a successful hunt."
"15453358-0-676";"Gloamium is an odd material. It looks like ordinary silver and it melts like iron, but these rivets don't feel like either of those metals. They're cold to the touch and won't warm even after I set them down by the fire."
"15453358-0-677";"I read about an experiment conducted in Valenwood around the turn of the era to suspend a shadow in liquid. The experiment supposedly didn't succeed. I think you just discovered proof to contradicting that assumption."
"15453358-0-678";"The inner cover proclaims this as a book of poetry to dazzle and capture the attention of others. Given the content, I doubt the attention is amorous. Unless the author believed that guts are a suitable gift for their beloved."
"15453358-0-679";"Our consultations for the Circle regularly force me to look up variations on the word fascinating. Just to be sure my missives to the group don't sound repetitive. Daedric in origin, I would say this chain is mesmeric. Reginus?"
"15453358-0-680";"If I was a scholar at a lesser institution like Shad Astula I might presume this necklace clasping was crafted at a bucolic jewelery near Cyrodiil. Instead, as I am rigorous, I tested it and found a number of Daedric micro-etchings beneath my lens."
"15453358-0-681";"An exquisite likeness of an Aureal Daedra and the companion piece to a similar cameo of a Mazken Amalien is examining. The detail on this is remarkable, perhaps done with specialized tools. At the very least, would require a master craftsman's skill."
"15453358-0-682";"A yoke to a necklace of exquisite beauty, the style of crafting is something I've never quite seen before. It seems almost as if made by two pairs of hands, two different artisans, though its diminuative size makes that almost impossible."
"15453358-0-683";"A cameo of a Dark Seducer, companion to a Golden Saint cameo being examined by Reginus. The detail is remarkable, almost as if the artisan made this piece at a larger scale to capture fine details and somehow reduced it in size again to fit on a necklace."
"15453358-0-684";"This looks to be a lovely representation of the historic Imperial metalsmithing style. Note the ornate handle on the decanter. The care taken in its construction indicates the Imperial appreciation of winemaking goes back further than I once thought."
"15453358-0-685";"A stunning find. The artistry demonstrated on the crystalline back of this hand mirror indicates it must have belonged to someone very important. The Ayleids weren't known for excessive vanity, but this would've been a precious keepsake."
"15453358-0-686";"This is not just any scabbard. Most Legion equipment, even historic armaments, tend toward practicality over ostentatious shows of rank. But the gilding on this scabbard suggests it was presented to its owner, perhaps as a commendation for their duty. King Rislav's crest is impressed in the metal. It's impossible to say if the king himself presented it, but certainly the recipient would have been a member of his court."
"15453358-0-687";"Take care with this map. The vellum is quite fragile. Such a beautiful depiction of the West Weald should be treasured. It does highlight the roads and other travel features. Perhaps this was meant for Colovian merchants?"
"15453358-0-688";"Despite its age, the tapestry's linen has held up quite well. My research suggests the gold pattern comes from Breton make. At least, I assume it was gold. Difficult to tell through the years of dirt."
"15453358-0-689";"I love the weight of a nice wool tapestry. And they last a long time. The pastoral scene is quite pleasant, but I can't tell exactly where it's supposed to depict."
"15453358-0-690";"Underneath the wear from age, this is quite a beautiful piece. I'll wager a guess it depicts one of the nicer Colovian estates. The ornate gateway in the Imperial style gives it away."
"15453358-0-691";"This fresco is fairly weathered and cracked. The artist clearly took inspiration from the rolling hills of the Gold Road. If you look closely, some of the leaves in the top left corner look like Bird Cherry leaves."
"15453358-0-692";"Pottery is often repaired long after the piece has been fired, but these cracks that are filled with vibrant red look about as old as the Pitcher. Perhaps they were intentional. Given the artwork, the red could represent blood or wine."
"15453358-0-693";"This sculpture is enormous! I can't imagine how long it took to make. It seems odd to me that the Ayleids needed to cast such large tree sculptures. Trees are common enough in the environments surrounding some ruins."
"15453358-0-694";"There are a lot of Welkynd Stones embedded in the material of this tree, but only on the branches. If I were to use these stones to store energy, I'd place them within reach. Perhaps the Ayleids didn't intend to use the stones' power."
"15453358-0-695";"The crystals embedded on this tree sculpture resemble some I've seen in Ayleid ruins off the Gold Coast. Surely it's welkynd, but I've never seen blue mist emit from them. No odor, but harmless."
"15453358-0-696";"You'd not believe how many it took to unearth an arch of this size. The meteoric iron used suggests Ayleid heritage. Possibly from a caved-in ruin? I know who'd like this one."
"15453358-0-697";"Strange to have a window that's riddled with cracks and that you can barely see though. But, oh, surely there's more to it than that! I'll sleep on this and have another look in the morning."
"15453358-0-698";"Clearly the Ayleids were trying to craft something of importance out of welkynd with this. A weapon to fight the rebellion? A shame they only discovered it near the cusp of their demise."
"15453358-0-699";"This is a sturdy find! Based on the texture and color of the stone, I can confidently say this slab originated in the Heartlands, near Cyrodiil. The River Niben is known for the quality of its basalt."
"15453358-0-700";"This looks to be an excellent example of an ancient blacksmithing component. The quality of this artifact is quite remarkable, especially given the fissures that seem to run across the exterior."
"15453358-0-701";"I haven't seen one of these in a while, good find! It's typical for blacksmiths to use decoctions of various metals in their work. The right mixture of ores can strengthen a forged item, much like finding the right balance of flavors in a cooked meal."
"15453358-0-702";"Leave it to the Ayleids to inscribe even their bracing with runes and enchantments. I can't make out what the markings may have imbued this artefact with. Maybe a blessing of strength or durability on whatever was forged here?"
"15453358-0-703";"You really need my help with this? It's an anvil, obviously. Looks decently worn, but from use, rather than time. It's in the Ayleid style, which places it firmly from the First Era. Anything else?"
"15453358-0-704";"Now this is truly ancient! First Era, maybe? I can't place what this artefact would be used for. The crescent shape suggests some form of lunar worship, but the material is an unusual metal that's been treated to resemble stone. Very intriguing."
"15453358-0-705";"I wish my fingers were as clever as whoever carved this! The fine details on this metal brace indicate a level of diligence and attention to detail that even Ugron could appreciate. Looks to be part of something larger, but I'm not sure what."
"15453358-0-706";"Few relics survive the eons unscathed. This mirror is no exception, it's got cracks running all over the surface. Still, it would have been a lovely vanity item for some ancient lady's compact. I wonder when it was broken."
"15453358-0-707";"The cogs and gears contained inside this base rival anything created by the Dwemer. But the style of the exterior is distinctly Ayleid. It's a conundrum. I need to consult my books and see if the two cultures ever shared their crafting skills."
"15453358-0-708";"Too large to be an earring, too small to be a key. The crystal at the end is clearly worn from touch, and it fits nicely in the hand. This was made to be used and handled, I just don't know what for."
"15453358-0-709";"Just a simple wheel made from iron. The outside rim appears smoothed, from years of hands passing over it. Something's off about its weight, however. It seems to change? Inconsistent."
"15453358-0-710";"A largely unremarkable stone crucible, with metallic residue as evidence of its original use. The only notable detail is this embedded icon of Hermaeus Mora. Who could guess that the One Who Knows might enjoy jewelry?"
"15453358-0-711";"I've used little stoves like this in my office in Solitude. Quite effective in heating a room on a cold Skyrim evening. The vent on top is curious, and dangerous I must say. Perhaps its for making food?"
"15453358-0-712";"A rod comprised of several wheels of various materials. I believe one is lead, perhaps another copper. Each wheel also has differing textures, some gritty while others more fine-grained. These remind me of sharpening stones."
"15453358-0-713";"This may look like a simple rack for a work table, but these ornate tentacles tell another story. I believe that they conduct power from Hermaeus Mora into the tools hung here."
"15453358-0-714";"Would be a nice piece of furniture if not for its immense weight. Wrought iron legs with stone shelving? My back hurts just thinking about lifting it into my study."
"15453358-0-715";"For as old as these brass legs are, they appear in remarkable condition. The foot rests appear worn a bit, but I don't see the stress fractures that I expected. I wonder what accounts for their unusual strength?"
"15453358-0-716";"A well-worn desktop made of a thick stone slab. I see etchings and gouges from tools, so likely this was once used as a work table. Somehow, it reminds me of the ancient stone coffins I've found."
"15453358-0-717";"A simple for smaller items, even with clear Daedric decorations. Perhaps it channels power from Oblivion into whatever sits on the shelves. Perhaps a now-dispelled enchantment that contained cursed items?"
"15453358-0-718";"Beautiful decorative pieces. Jade stones set inside brass holders. The use of two stones side by side is unique and gives them the appearance of eyes. No doubt part of a larger design."
"15453358-1-77";"I concur. These irregularities are taking great liberties with the region. This map from the same year omits Camlorn entirely. This hardly seems like a mere oversight. I believe this was a deliberate attempt to obfuscate their shrinking territories."
"15453358-1-78";"Wasn't that the name of the Orc king from the thirty-year siege? I'd read that he invaded Stormhaven and blockaded Wayrest's trade lanes. There wasn't any mention of an Orc settlement. Was Golkarr an early casualty of the war?"
"15453358-1-79";"If they were anything like their descendants, then I'd say that's an understatement. The three major houses are constantly vying for control. It's a miracle that the kingdom isn't in a constant state of civil war, especially without a king on the throne."
"15453358-1-80";"Not unlike the sea serpents scrawled in naval charts, eh? This must be Satakal, the Yokudan serpent god. They believed we all dwell upon the serpent, so it's safe to assume that this is a symbolic representation."
"15453358-1-81";"Attacks like these were used to justify the sacking of Orsinium, despite the fact that Goblins did not occupy the city. According to oral histories, the Orc clans and Goblin tribes maintained a truce within the Dragontail Mountains, but did not mingle."
"15453358-1-82";"Indeed. Only a cartographer in service to the First Empire of the Nords would draft such a map. I'd date this to around the year 400 in the First Era."
"15453358-1-83";"Ah yes. The Sun's Death! I see several roads leading away from the darkened areas. Perhaps these were Dunmer escape routes, showing the way to new settlements?"
"15453358-1-84";"These marks don't necessarily imply settlement locations. I suggest they could be warnings. The Argonian population would not take kindly to encroachment in this era. They were much more isolated then."
"15453358-1-85";"Windhelm in particular is the oldest human settlement in all of Tamriel. One wonders what stories and treasures have been forgotten in this ancient land."
"15453358-1-86";"And Giant territory, too! I wonder if any Giant burial grounds are marked on this map? I've heard that Giants seek out their ancestral burial grounds when they feel death drawing near."
"15453358-1-87";"Or perhaps someone chose to note that location on this map since it is culturally significant, Amalien. Haven't I seen you do that yourself when you're sketching out your own maps?"
"15453358-1-88";"Curious--Falinesti is marked on the map. I know that the city hasn't been seen in many years, but even in the days when it was accessible, I thought that the Walking City's location was uncertain."
"15453358-1-89";"Yes, this seems quite old. Modern maps of the region evince High Elf influence. Remember, the Dominion has tried to influence Greenshade both culturally and architecturally. This map seems to predate their concerted attempts to do so."
"15453358-1-90";"Interesting. Several Ayleid holds and cities are marked on the map: Abamath, Belarata, Ilayas. This map must have been made early in the First Era, shortly after the Ayleids withdrew to the Valenwood. Some of these sites were lost for centuries."
"15453358-1-91";"The region's history of conflict no doubt shaped the warrior cultures of the nomadic Khajiit tribes. The rest of Tamriel knows the Khajiit as traveling merchants, but Anequina--the northern Khajiit realm--has always been a martial kingdom."
"15453358-1-93";"I don't see any references to the original thirteen strongholds. Of course, Imperial cartographers never spent much time digging into the details of Orcish stronghold-law."
"15453358-1-94";"Ha! Tribunal priests are the true impediments to cartography in the region. I can scarcely believe how often the island is locked away, reopened, and so on. Travel to the island is quite simple nowadays, but you'll find many doors closed to outsiders."
"15453358-1-95";"Amalien has the right of it. This map seems more utilitarian than strictly decorative. Something belonging to a ship's captain or a trader perhaps."
"15453358-1-96";"You're right, Verita. And you certainly weren't exaggerating when you spoke about the shores and terrain shifting. Just look where the cartographer placed Blackrose Prison and Lilmoth."
"15453358-1-97";"Hmm. It's clearly quite old, but the cartographer didn't include the boundaries of Elsweyr's sixteen kingdoms. I suppose the artist rendered it shortly after the northern half of the province consolidated under the Anequine banner."
"15453358-1-98";"Things certainly looked cleaner when this cartographer set paint to parchment. Look at these brush strokes. I doubt even Archmagister Vanus Galerion could match this Khajiit's artistry with the brush and pen."
"15453358-1-99";"Some of the oldest wooden relics on Summerset have a similar appearance. If they managed to turn something utilitarian like a boat into a magnificent object like this ... well, I would hate to be a woodworker looking at this."
"15453358-1-100";"I assume you're talking about the sun marking? I've seen it in some of the mosaics in Firsthold. Particularly around Torinaan's ruin. It looks more like heraldry than religion iconography to me. Maybe Torinaan's calan-sigil."
"15453358-1-101";"Legends speak of Aldmeri music that could ease the mind and ward off grief entirely. A valuable property for such a long-lived race. Obviously, this mechanism isn't capable of such things, but hearing an Aldmeri melody would likely bring joy to any Elf."
"15453358-1-111";"The Sload didn't have much use for shells in general. Way I hear it, they eschewed most tools. Slippery grip, you see? But they did use armor occasionally (if All Flags logs can be believed). Their flabby bodies couldn't boast much natural protection."
"15453358-1-112";"Do you think the Sload could have used these for necromantic purposes? Perhaps the unique slimy properties of the anemone aided in their particular magic, and that's why their skill with it is so refined!"
"15453358-1-113";"Undoubtedly. The Sload used the tangled nest of coral formations to get around, but they must have developed a way to harvest it as well. I can't even begin to imagine how. This coral feels hard as stone, and I can't imagine a Sload swinging a pick!"
"15453358-1-114";"Perhaps they shed the stuff! Many seaborn creatures shed their skins to grow, right? Crabs and that sort of thing. I can almost imagine some pink, smelly thing climbing out of a leathery shell!"
"15453358-1-115";"They likely gathered it from the bottom of the sea—from shipwrecks and the like. Maormer that strayed too close. Maybe even Yokudans or Lefthanded Elves. Even so, this metal feels lighter than most. Buoyant even."
"15453358-1-116";"Snowy sabre cats would have been abundant in the areas Snow Elves nobles inhabited, especially at the time. It's not out of the question to say they could have been the main source of material for clothes and a variety of other resources."
"15453358-1-117";"There are some alchemical practices that can petrify wood in a matter of hours. It makes for a strong, nearly indestructible material that can be used in a lot of different ways, though it's hard to tell what it was used for here."
"15453358-1-118";"Many worshiped Auri-El at the time, and still do! Not just the Snow Elves. We know so little of their history, even that may be a matter of debate. Though I will concede the area that this was found supports the theory."
"15453358-1-119";"The shape is a little vague, but these almost seem like the soles of shoes to me. They would be the right length for an Altmer foot, if we're going with the theory that this is Snow Elf in origin. I suppose it could just as easily be a cooking utensil."
"15453358-1-120";"Is that really so odd? Snow Elves and Dwarves coexisted for untold centuries in what is now Skyrim. These rivets might be evidence of cross-cultural collaboration, right? Both civilizations had so much to teach each other!"
"15453358-1-121";"This looks like Y'ffre, I agree. But his aspect seems far less distant than normal. He appears to be howling, or snarling behind a matted wreath of leaves. That's more than a little unsettling."
"15453358-1-122";"You don't often see serpent imagery in Wood Elf crafts, but yes, I'd agree with Ugron. Creatures summoned up by the Wild Hunt defy all attempts to identify them. They might appear like snakes one moment, then fish the next. Ghastly."
"15453358-1-123";"Wood Elves caught up in a Wild Hunt ritual supposedly change into strange animals, but some say turning into water is also one of their capabilities. This might be a depiction of a Bosmer that has become ... liquified."
"15453358-1-124";"Careful with this charm. It's old, but the fangs on that thing are still sharp enough to cut. The Wild Hunt is said to strip the flesh from bone in the blink of an eye ... this might be a reminder."
"15453358-1-125";"If I'm not mistaken, shapeless beings often appear in the hunt. According to this tome of Bosmeri history, Wood Elves transformed by the ritual sometimes take on the aspect of ""great writhing tongues, unfettered by lips or teeth."" Gross."
"15453358-1-126";"The torc seems incomplete because it is incomplete. Dwarves probably forged jewelry like this from several different strands braided together. Makes sense. Metallurgists tell me the Dwemer combined different metals to make their eponymous alloy."
"15453358-1-127";"Singing? Not in any fashion that a High Elf would take pleasure in, I wager. Dwarves prized cold logic over beauty, and I can't think of anything less logical than singing. They likely let their instruments do the talking."
"15453358-1-128";"The Dwarves probably fashioned neck-rings (or torcs, to be precise) for many different purposes. Necklaces often harness powerful enchantments, so I'm not surprised to find a piece of a torc that boosts the strength of the object's magic."
"15453358-1-129";"Ah, I've got it! This torc was created to harness tonal architecture—the Dwarven craft of using sound to shape reality itself. It was a powerful form of magic … or machinery. Although I'm not sure the Dwarves differentiated between the two."
"15453358-1-130";"Common quartz, yes, but not in the context of this magical torc. Quartz is a crystal, and crystals possess many unusual qualities regarding the transmission of sound. To carve or shape this stone might have ruined its natural resonance. Or so I guess."
"15453358-1-131";"From the Malacath cult that rose to prominence after the sack of the first Orsinium? Are you sure? As I understand it, only a handful of those ever existed. And aren't they cursed as well? Perhaps we should put it back ...."
"15453358-1-132";"Fascinating? My research refers to them as Malacath fanatics intent on wiping out the Bretons and Redguards for every real and imagined slight perpetrated by them against the Orcs. Those rings represent vengeance, nothing more."
"15453358-1-133";"Right. I remember that story. From the Orsinimum Codex. Malacath appeared before him and gifted him with a ring for every member of the cult--after they sacrificed an entire village of Bretons to the Ashpit. Ghastly."
"15453358-1-134";"As with every legend, I am sure there is a kernel of truth to the story. I've seen forgeries over the years, but only a limited number of the true rings were known to exist. This is definitely one of them. An Orc can always tell."
"15453358-1-135";"That's what the legends tell us. Another gift from Malacath to his most-devoted followers. Of course, they were also quite mad. Violent fanatics who swore to die for what they believed in. And they did, too. A brutal and relatively short existence."
"15453358-1-136";"I pricked my finger on one of those pointy teeth. It felt like something was sucking at the wound as I pulled away! If I was going to make a bloodsucking belt, why would I put the teeth on the inside of the band? Maybe this was an instrument of torture?"
"15453358-1-137";"Touching this dredged up an unpleasant memory I'd hoped never to relive. It reminded me of the work of a Bosmer tanner I met in Valenwood who was a devoted practitioner of the Green Pact. The lifelike feeling makes my skin crawl."
"15453358-1-138";"It's not my area of expertise, I know, but it seems that there is a deliberate gap between the plating and where it would sit on the collar. Honestly, it reminds me of a drain basin. What purpose would that serve?"
"15453358-1-139";"Tested the metal where the enamel paint was flaking. Daedric. The rare material might explain the minimal coverage, but why use so much of it on superfluous spikes then? An armorer this skilled creating something so impractical ... it must be ceremonial."
"15453358-1-140";"There are a series of holes spanning the entire circumference of the waist, presumably for fastening. It's excessive in my opinion. This many points of contact wouldn't improve stability much and be more prone to buckling. I can't see another function."
"15453358-1-141";"That's Nedic sculpting, actually. Devotional idols were common, though I've never seen one depicting an Elven Divine before. Her pose suggests she's in a lover's embrace. It's clear that there's another piece to this figure."
"15453358-1-142";"Your penchant for assumption is intolerable, Reginus. Dorald was a priest of the Alessian Order who attempted to impose a theocracy on the Colovians. Rislav's defiance of the Empire was seen as the rebuke of a tyrannical cult."
"15453358-1-144";"An expert, if dry, assessment, Ugron. This sort of vague, incendiary language smacks of propaganda meant to weaponize the populace for private interest. It strains credulity that Wayrest endured a thousand years of oppression before revolting."
"15453358-1-145";"It depends on the clan. There's ample evidence of harmony between Nedes and Orcs in Craglorn. But you're right—clans in Stormhaven tended to take a more offensive posture against non-Orc neighbors and each other. We hadn't learned the value of unity yet."
"15453358-1-147";"The telltale mark of authenticity here is the inscription. It's written in Aldmeris, signifying pride in their Elven heritage. Breton nobility ceased the practice around the time that High Rock joined the Alessian Empire."
"15453358-1-148";"Incorrect. Those figures were a deliberate attempt by unscrupulous archeologists to inflate their value. My own research suggests Flowdys circulated these coins through all Northpoint's trade to spread word of his new trade port."
"15453358-1-150";"It's safe to say that the serpent imagery throughout this piece represents the First Serpent, Satakal, in Redguard mythology, best known for devouring itself. Modern devotees are said to shed their skin in gruesome rituals with winding daggers."
"15453358-1-151";"Not necessarily. Stories of the Firehide clan's battles with the Yokudans in Alik'r persist in the oral tradition. They describe warriors for whom war was a dance and could turn aside a blade with two fingers."
"15453358-1-153";"I think the symbolism is clear, but my research indicates that these were carried by the entire Bangkorai Garrison in the decades following his self-sacrifice. Given their penchant for bloodletting rites, these were likely created by the knightly order."
"15453358-1-154";"This root is similar to the one Verita studied, though it depicts a scaled woman similar to a Lamia, but retaining more human qualities than any of the beastfolk I've seen. I can't tell if these figures are different aspects of one woman or several."
"15453358-1-156";"Frandar Hunding was a master navigator. He'd have to be to guide a fleet the size of the first Ra Gada to undiscovered lands without losing any ships. It may bear his name in honor of his legacy, even if he had nothing to do with its creation."
"15453358-1-157";"It does appear to be Goblin in make, though the markings are different from the Dogeater tribe who currently reside here. Goblins were likely the only inhabitants of these isles between the Dwemer's disappearance and the Redguard colonization."
"15453358-1-159";"Heavy, orichalc screws with a ring for attaching rope or chain. These would have been driven into wood gates and palisades under cover of darkness to allow the Orcs to pull down barricades from a safe distance prior to an attack."
"15453358-1-160";"Given the Ayleid's enthusiastic veneration of Daedra, this eye probably represents Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of knowledge. He's not often idolized. Maybe because he's reclusive compared to so many of the Princes ... or because he's hard to depict."
"15453358-1-162";"Note the shape of the neck and design of the strap. This is a warrior's wineskin. The owner may have raided Stonefalls during the Nedic campaign against the Chimer in this area. Such brutal work would require easy access to intoxicants."
"15453358-1-163";"I believe this dates to sometime early in the First Era. Stonefalls endured an invasion by the First Empire of the Nords in that time. It seems likely that this horn heralded the army's rampage upon the land."
"15453358-1-165";"My apologies Reginus, but I don't think the figures represent the Tribunal. See the postures? These are the ""Good Daedra"" as Ashlanders call them. But why would nomads from the last era have such intricate metalwork?"
"15453358-1-166";"These aren't full Daedric sentences; they're more like words of power. An attempt to infuse the mask with healing hedge magic. Seems this was a shamanic medicine mask. However, words like ""stasis,"" ""wither,"" and ""barren"" confuse me."
"15453358-1-168";"An interesting idea, but we may not need to go that far. I surmise these dolls were used to imprint a connection between Argonian hatchlings and the Hist. Notice how the bark still feels tacky? Perhaps it was once covered in sap for early exposure."
"15453358-1-169";"Based on the region, the posture of supplication to Vile, and the obvious lack of any clothing, I believe the figure to be Kothringi. This must date to before their shift to worship of Z'en. Or belong to a lone cult that held on to the old ways."
"15453358-1-171";"Is the talent in the bones, or in the caster? I suspect that more than a few augurs put on a good show of pouring out the bones before telling their visitors what their visitors want to hear. Still, this set is old and well-preserved."
"15453358-1-172";"Not so surprising--Akaviri armies fought their way across Morrowind and Skyrim during the First Akaviri Invasion, 1E 2703. The invaders conquered huge parts of both realms before Reman stopped them at the Pale Pass."
"15453358-1-174";"Lovely! The stylized leaves in the design appear to represent ash trees, renowned for the strength and durability of their wood. Perhaps the owner held a special reverence for the Kynesgrove and sought the Keepers' blessing?"
"15453358-1-175";"Sorry, but that animal's face does not say ""commitment and fertility"" to me. The snarling expression reminds me of carved doorposts I've seen near the River Yorgrim. I think this brooch is a warlike thane's house emblem."
"15453358-1-177";"Curious that a wooden artifact of this age is in such good condition. These are no common runes—an ancient enchantment clings to the oar. Perhaps the oar's owner followed the Old Ways of the Nords and sought the blessing of their animal gods?"
"15453358-1-178";"Of course it's a Dragon Cult mask—anyone can see that. Let me offer a more scholarly assessment: The mask's warlike design suggests a more aggressive posture—something that a Dragon worshiper might wear into battle."
"15453358-1-180";"The pieces look so oddly proportioned! I suppose these smaller tokens represent slave races? Argonians have complained about Dematah's troubling themes for centuries. I'd say this vindicates those claims! Is it just me, or is this board larger than usual?"
"15453358-1-181";"Figures of Dark Elves at ease repose around the upper rim, supported in their indolence by those whom they have enslaved. Rather cynical, in its way. Likely this great cup graced the table of a high-ranked noble from one of the Dunmeri Great Houses."
"15453358-1-183";"Perhaps a favor from the very first one? In 1E 2260? I read a journal account from that very festival stating that several different favors passed around, including ribbons for those whose families served in the All Flags Navy."
"15453358-1-184";"Charm people? Hardly. That feeling you have is natural reaction to peerless craftsmanship. And the presence of a snake does not always mean Maormer were involved. I could see a Mer crafting this elegant item simply because they like snakes!"
"15453358-1-186";"A hunting scene, or a scene of the Wild Hunt? It seems to me that the monstrous figures are chasing the human-shaped figures, not the other way around. The Bosmer rarely depict their ancient ritual--this is an unusual find!"
"15453358-1-187";"The figure lacks the cowl and wings often seen in Meridia's depictions. That would seem to date it to the waning days of the Ayleid Empire, when Elves like the Barsaebics distanced themselves from their Heartland kin who served darker masters."
"15453358-1-189";"As I understand it, these totems in Ayleid culture were only used as a last resort. It wasn't common practice to have one unless a couple was truly having trouble conceiving."
"15453358-1-190";"The talisman itself is made out of tar. We might be looking at something from the tar-pit burial sites in Ouze where the Bosmer who were rejected from the Green Pact were buried. Some say alive."
"15453358-1-192";"Gryphon or harpy bone, perhaps? It resembles a large bird's femur, but it's much too big for any ordinary avian. I suspect that the creature whose bone this was may have played an important part in the story inscribed here."
"15453358-1-193";"Many Ayleid clans fled to the Valenwood during the collapse of their empire, but the style is representative of the height of their civilization: ME 850 or 900, I think. Most likely this was a noble's treasure carried away into exile."
"15453358-1-195";"Priests? No, these figures are warrior-monks, not priests. I think this censer comes from one of the temples of the Two-Moons Dance. The prominence of the moons in the design and the martial poses of the Khajiit would seem to make that pretty clear."
"15453358-1-196";"This djerid belonged to a very important Khajiit; the streamers are a badge of high rank. I believe this was the weapon of a hunt-lord, leader of one of the March's nomadic tribes. Naturally, skill in the hunt was a vital test of fitness to lead."
"15453358-1-198";"This has to be Khenarthi, right? I wonder if all pipes made around this time were modeled after her. Or if they started as idols and then turned into pipes along the way? It looks like this one is holding something in its claws."
"15453358-1-199";"Keep in mind, the Khajiit of this area were renowned fishermen. Their innovations vastly exceeded others of the time, and they took it very seriously. These embellishments were likely a token of respect and reverence rather than functionality."
"15453358-1-204";"I don't like the look of this. While I agree with Amalien on it being part of a rack, I think it's more likely it came from the Vile Laboratory. The material on the ends mimics Dwarven metal - but it's colder and lighter or something. Daedric simulacra?"
"15453358-1-205";"Given where this was found, I wonder if we should consider the possibility of this being from the Lightless Oubliette. The blue crystal residue might be a clue! There were no white or gold colored crystals allowed inside the prison."
"15453358-1-207";"I'd defer to you and Verita on matters Nedic, but this cloth seems saturated in arcane residue. I've seen the work of hedge mages trying to master ""soul magic."" This bears all the telltale signs. Did any of the Nedes meddle with anima?"
"15453358-1-208";"Yes, a prime example of Nedic stonecraft-jewelry! A stonesmith likely created it for a Nede of high station--a queen, or a princess perhaps? You're right to point out that serpents often appear in Nedic ruins, but I've never seen one in their jewelry."
"15453358-1-213";"The size and weight seem wrong. Orcish effigies are heavier--more roughly hewn. Judging by the figure's attire, it could be a tiny depiction of King Thagore. Though even that feels like a stretch. One of the arms is missing. I wonder what it carried."
"15453358-1-214";"Yes, definitely Orcish make. The material looks like coal-hardened potash. According to Thugbo gro-Thutt's ""History of the 13 Clans"" map, clan Nazhag was closest to reported deposits at the time. It must be from them."
"15453358-1-216";"This thing is hideous. I don't think any self-respecting merchant lord would wear this, much less have it specifically made for them. There has to be something more to this. Look at the stitching! That kind of detail would take months to perfect."
"15453358-1-217";"Look closer. These snakes bear all the traits of early Maormer craftsmanship. In fact, I think it would be more accurate to call them sea serpents. You can tell from the shape of the snout and that distinctive head-frill."
"15453358-1-219";"Let's not sidestep the obvious, Reginus. This clearly hung from the snout of an ancient minotaur. It displays a level of craftsmanship we don't typically see in Minotaur attire, though. And what are these etchings. Clasped hands?"
"15453358-1-220";"Look at the position of the neck. It seems to be looking up, to me. Fishermen in Anvil swear that broken statues rest at the bottom of the pond under the famous mermaid. Could something or someone be looking up at her? I'd check, but I can't swim!"
"15453358-1-222";"I think this used to be a Dwarven rod of some kind;  a device used to direct animunculi, or inscribe their strange maths on hard surfaces. These modifications don't appear to incorporate any of the devices complex machinery, though."
"15453358-1-223";"Crabs, Ugron! Chimer used these to guide the movements of truly massive creatures. Sure, places like Ald'ruhn make it seem like Ashlanders simply killed giant crabs like Skar, but who's to say these creatures weren't used for transportation as well?"
"15453358-1-225";"Don't be so quick to dismiss such things, Verita. The Clockwork City is a very real place. I think. In any case, this looks like some sort of ancient vessel. I see a crystaline residue inside. Residual accumulation from some kind of alchemical solution?"
"15453358-1-226";"I know precious little about Sotha Sil's followers, but a mad mage I spoke to insisted that Sotha Sil's followers--the Clockwork Apostles--worship Sotha Sil, obviously, but they've also turned their back on Daedra-worship entirely! Can you imagine?"
"15453358-1-228";"Yeah, looks like aetherquartz to me. High Elf aldarchs use it in their sacred chalices, and the like. I doubt this started as a shoddy decanter. Someone melted an object down and reshaped it into this."
"15453358-1-229";"It's not literal. High Elf jurisreeves—inspectors of a sort—travel in groups of three, just as they have since the Aldmer first arrived on Summerset Isle. One member of a quorum is called the admanen, or ""listening eye."" I've never seen one wear a badge."
"15453358-1-231";"A member of an extinct species, if memory serves. Helstrom crocodiles died out during the Second Empire's march on Black Marsh and the subsequent environmental disaster called the ""Great Burn"" in 1E 2828. Good riddance. Today's crocodiles are big enough!"
"15453358-1-232";"Try again, Reginus. Argonians use their grave stakes to pin down their dead so they don't rise again as bog blights. But that's not all that noteworthy. What is interesting is the material. Argonians rarely work in stone. This xul-vaat is clearly ancient."
"15453358-1-234";"When Elsweyr was divided, Anequina had a reputation for being a land of warriors. But Pellitine had money, and they could hire the muscle they needed. This may have been a calling card of sorts."
"15453358-1-235";"The Thrassian Plague came down along trade routes in Elsweyr. It's likely they didn't have any means to combat it, and even once they started, by then it was already too late. This may have been an early attempt at protection."
"15453358-1-237";"That's because it's not a traditional weapon. The spiked shaft here is meant to penetrate heavy scale and not let go, but only if loosed at great velocity. From a ballista or similar weapon, I wager."
"15453358-1-238";"Oh, sweet Gabrielle, that's because the material is extremely rare. Meteoric-Iron was used to construct this monstrosity of war. The question is why? Overcompensation at its finest. Perhaps its gaudy nature is meant to be ornamental."
"15453358-1-240";"The small figures depicted in the design have bared weapons, so I doubt that this was some lonely hunter's love-token. More likely, the runes were meant as a charm or prayer for protection in battle. A shame they are too worn to make out clearly."
"15453358-1-241";"Dragon-horn is too rare a commodity to serve as some Nord's lucky mead-cup. Still, the silver chasing on this piece is exceptional. In my estimation, this is an early 1E 22nd-century funerary piece commissioned for a jarl's burial."
"15453358-1-243";"Giving up so soon? That's hardly the Amalien I know. Look closer. Just there, near the spine and along the edges. See those glyphs? Barely visible to the eye? This book may have played a role in secret Psijic correspondence."
"15453358-1-244";"Old Elves and their crazy magic. It reminds me of a pestle of some kind. For dipping, stirring, or crushing. I hear the Psijics can read water. Some kind of powerful augury based on watching ripples. Maybe they make the ripples with this?"
"15453358-1-246";"The works of Divayth Fyr aren't exactly the most reliable books on the subject, Amalien. Even so, this doesn't resemble any pearl I've seen before. Was it always this yellow? Is that a unique property of grummite pearls?"
"15453358-1-247";"A Sheogorath relic? Maybe, but it may relate to the Altmer. This could be a meditation hexahedron. They considered the numbers 3, 5, and 8 to be sacred. Hmm. In retrospect, they used meditation octagons. Very well. A Madness Cube it is."
"15453358-1-249";"Just look at those hammer-strike indentations. It seems like 1E Orcish smiths wielded tools even larger than those used by Orcs today. I've never lifted hammer or tong personally, but I don't see how tools that size would allow for finer touches."
"15453358-1-250";"Fascinating! Makes one wonder how the Antiquarian's Eye managed to find it. It clearly comes from Oblivion. The question is, what part of Oblivion? The connection to Molag Bal seems clear enough, but the shapes resemble crystals from the Spiral Skein."
"15453358-1-251";"Too right, Ugron. I spent some time in Elden Root recently, and I saw all manner of Green-wrought marvels there. Only thing that puzzles me is the shade and the grain. It doesn't resemble any of the furniture I saw in Grahtwood."
"15453358-1-252";"It's the teeth, Verita! I've never seen fangs like that on a Wood Elf chime. Did you notice those brass rings? Why use metal to hang something when gut and sinew would do? I wager those teeth belong to rare quarry. A long extinct beast, perhaps!"
"15453358-1-253";"Come now, Verita, this is one of the rare Kjervilde Craniums! A product of the late First Era's most eminent taxidermist! Did you take note of the pristine condition of the bone and the brilliant gold etchings? This is an object of rare beauty!"
"15453358-1-254";"A result of the lizard-people's close ties to Sithis, no doubt. What I find odd is the more realistic aesthetic. Most Argonian stone-carvings appear blockier. More abstract. And what of this polished stone? It lacks the texture of an Argonian egg."
"15453358-1-255";"By all the stars ... it's a Sun Bird relic! Back in the Merethic, an order of Aldmeri explorers managed to pierce the veil between Mundus and Aetherius using raw magic of the Ehlnofey. Or something. This might have been a focus--an orienteering tool!"
"15453358-1-256";"I met a band of explorers in Shornhelm a few years back. They swore up and down that a red crystal lies at the heart of the Doomcrag. I did some digging in Erokii afterward. Found a broken fresco depicting the creation of a crystal, but nothing else."
"15453358-1-257";"Yes. Almost makes one wonder why the Wood Elves don't request other things, like clothes that don't smell like old mammoth cheese. I've never seen a tree in Malabal Tor leak sap like this. Could it have come from Falinesti?"
"15453358-1-258";"I still detect some residual magic swimming between the shards. Difficult to determine the nature of the enchantment after all this time, but it definitely feels tied to the illusory school ... something to do with minds and mortal will."
"15453358-1-259";"Yes indeed! It's difficult to determine if this is Tamrielic matter transformed by the obelisk's impact, or some fragment of the obelisk itself. I'd like to conduct some experiments on it. Those striations seem overloaded with magicka!"
"15453358-1-260";"You're likely right, Amalien. Yokudans wielded powerful magic where stones were concerned. The Redguards' distaste for magic makes discussing it a little awkward. But these stones absolutely possessed some magical potency."
"15453358-1-261";"Exactly right, Amalien. Odd to find such a fine, polished object carved in the Chimeric tradition. Velothi asceticism and Boethian values drove them to work in unconventional materials, even during their Golden Age. This feels modern. Overly geometric."
"15453358-1-262";"Judging by the filigrees, I'd date it back to the 1E 2200's. I've seen paintings of Bretonic All-Flags warships with similar patterning around the prow. This coffer may have contained a bounty for a captain who participated in the attack on Thras."
"15453358-1-263";"I sense some faded magic here. Did your people enchant these drums, Ugron? It's something in the runes. there's an intention there that seems ... well, it seems very angry, to be perfectly honest. Sorry!"
"15453358-1-264";"Unquestionably. That leads us to puzzle over what purpose it served. Based on its shape, one might mistake it for a wayshrine. But it can't be that. Look inside. The metallic shrine indicates a religious function."
"15453358-1-265";"I do. Home. Aldmeris. The beginning place for all the mer of Tamriel. I doubt the real Aldmeris looked anything like this. But just looking at it stirs up a feeling in me ... like entering my father's house after a long journey abroad."
"15453358-1-266";"That's your problem, Reginus. You have no imagination! This came from the Clockwork City—a world of arcane wonders where anything is possible! Based on these ""exodromal notes"" we received, it seems this is some sort of remembering-device. I guess?"
"15453358-1-267";"Yes, this is definitely First Council-era craftsmanship. Note the script surrounding the seal. Dagoth written in Daedric runes. The other Houses went to great lengths to scrub House Dagoth's legacy from the history books. This is quite a discovery!"
"15453358-1-268";"The shapes featured in his panoply definitely match some of the pieces in the Gwylim First Council collection. Bit more conservative than I'd expect, though. I always had the sense that Chimer armor favored form over function. More exposed skin, etc."
"15453358-1-269";"Not just any lunar phases. These seventeen arrangements correspond to the seventeen distinct furstocks of the Khajiit. The question is, what significance would a pool of water have? Perhaps new Khajiit were anointed in sacred water from Moonlit Cove?"
"15453358-1-270";"Look again. I've seen enough executioners' axes to know old blood when I see it. The Argonians worship Sithis. They used to have a whole school of priests dedicated to the dark. Nisswos they were called. This looks like their handiwork."
"15453358-1-271";"Undoubtedly. The Alessian collapse struck High Rock harder than most, given the Bretons' natural stubbornness and distaste for a unified governing structure. Warring fiefs sprung up all over the peninsula in the centuries that followed."
"15453358-1-272";"Can't say as I approve of such a sweeping principle, but it does tend to be correct. This certainly features Ysgramor, flanked by Atmoran runes.The Draconic silhouettes and ruby inlays clearly indicate this chalice belonged to someone of high station."
"15453358-1-273";"I assume you're citing old Skaal stories, Amalien? Personally, I've never seen any compelling evidence of a godly connection to this material. The world is full of naturally occurring substances with fantastical origin stories. Stalhrim is no different."
"15453358-1-274";"Yeah, a handful of Crowns in Bergama tried to bring me into the fold. Just trust me on this: nothing good ever comes from snake worship. People bound to this idea of death and rebirth always wind up as wild-eyed cultists. Just the way of the world."
"15453358-1-275";"There's a reason for that, Gabrielle. This isn't a sculpture at all. I'm surprised that you--a mage--haven't considered the possibility that this is a real guar magically transformed into metal. Probably the work of some Telvanni apprentice!"
"15453358-1-276";"Take note of the number of sconces in the chandelier--eight welkynd stones in all to honor the Eight Divines. This lends credence to my theory that Elven numerology played a role in Ayleid civilization, just as it does in modern High Elf culture."
"15453358-1-277";"The sculptor clearly did not intend for the viewer to take this as a literal depiction. The vacant, bovine affect on the subject's face reveals no heroic personality, and the wings are far too small. This is a symbolic representation of the subject."
"15453358-1-278";"Yes, I met several Moth Priests during my years in university. The older priests made a point of washing their hands before, after, and sometimes during a reading. This residue in the bowl is interesting. Some kind of cleaning agent, perhaps?"
"15453358-1-279";"I suspect this is a Bretonic work--perhaps given to Hestra as a gift after High Rock's admission to the Empire. As you know, the Alessian Order placed tight restrictions on graven images of Alessia. We'll likely never know what she really looked like."
"15453358-1-280";"Yes, the Mournhold aesthetic is difficult to miss. And as you all know, Almalexia serves as that city's patron deity. While all the Tribunes are the subjects of religious adoration, Almalexia-worship cleaves closest to Tamrielic norms, stylistically."
"15453358-1-281";"This isn't the White-Gold Tower. It's the Direnni Tower. Surely you can recognize the differences between the two? The light is a puzzle, though. Judging by the weight, this stone might house a metal core, just like the genuine article."
"15453358-1-282";"Ugron, always the worrier! As you said, any magic this gate might have harnessed dissipated centuries ago! The structure doesn't conform to any Chimeric aesthetic I'm aware of. It almost seems like something conceived in Oblivion itself!"
"15453358-1-283";"Odd to find it in Khenarthi's Roost, unless Khenarthia was a client state of Pa'alatiin by that point. As for the crystal itself, I've never seen the like. I've found similar opal spheres used in Magrus worship. Perhaps a meteoric ritual object?"
"15453358-1-284";"The image is really something, eh? Masser and Secunda--or Jone and Jode--swimming in wispy clouds .... It's sort of romantic, I think. I could weave a glamour like this for a moment or two, but to set an image in glass permanently? That's rare spellcraft."
"15453358-1-285";"Excellent deduction, Reginus! You might be missing something, though. As you know, tapestries featuring the Sea Elf king, Orgnum, often depict him with three hands. You see? Three hands--three coils. This might be a sculpture of Orgnum himself!"
"15453358-1-286";"This has all the hallmarks of Molag Bal. Torture, exhibitionism, the sharp-edged aesthetic, and so on. I doubt he uses it to motivate by fear. His whole realm of Coldharbour is a manifestation of fear and exploitation. This is something else."
"15453358-1-287";"I recognize the Stuhn connection, but this statue feels less devotional than other Stuhn-precursor carvings I've seen. It feels like a purely aesthetic exercise. See the whorls supporting the whale? Do they look like clouds to anyone else?"
"15453358-1-288";"That's because the Khajiit never placed this window in one of their ancestral temples. See the similarities to Imperial glasswork? Clearly, Khajiiti glassworkers made this for a converted temple. Perhaps the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin."
"15453358-1-289";"As Daedric Princes go, she's not all that bad. What interests me is the craftsmanship. Someone built a shrine to her in Skyrim, granted. But this hardly seems Nord-inspired. Those curled arms feel Nibenese to me. Odd to find it in Colovia."
"15453358-1-290";"I doubt any amount of strength could yank that crown off, Reginus. It's spell-locked. Tight. It probably has to do with all this meteoric glass. Do you see the inset stones? They're exerting force on the iron."
"15453358-1-291";"I've seen something like this before in a Barsaebic ruin down south. You're right about the size, Reginus. I think the Ayleids used that stone in conjunction with the meteoric iron to help it function at reduced size. I'm no mage, though."
"15453358-1-292";"Not just any sacrifices. Given the scarcity of Atmoran jewelry, I have a hunch that precious stones are far less common there--or perhaps just more difficult to excavate. Ruby effigies would be reserved for extremely important services only."
"15453358-1-293";"No. Look at the seams and gears. This thing comes apart somehow, guaranteed. I'd bet my left tusk that it's a coffer of some kind. No idea what we might find inside, though. Maybe a specialized dynamo? A gem of some kind?"
"15453358-1-294";"Well, as you know, the Atmorans associated foxes with Shor—the totemic analogue for Lorkhan. No Elf would ever depict Lorkhan in such a flattering shape. But the smooth contours and sharp features feel Merish to me. Consider me stumped!"
"15453358-1-295";"Undoubtedly! Note the sword and the figure's morphology. You can correct me if I'm wrong here, but this doesn't match any Khajiiti furstocks I'm aware of. Ohmes-raht come close, but the facial features are completely different. I think it's Boethra!"
"15453358-1-296";"Yeah, it's Khenarthi. She seems to be ushering that spectral Khajiit somewhere--presumably the Sands Behind the Stars. Khajiiti and Nord theology both present Kynareth as a guide to paradise. Odd considering how remote each civilization is from the other."
"15453358-1-297";"It might be an early Laenius. I'm no artist, but as far as I'm concerned, Gavros Laenius doesn't get anywhere near the credit he deserves. No one renders water like him. The Niben seems to wash across the canvas! Gorgeous!"
"15453358-1-298";"It really makes one wonder how these children of the Aldmer managed the cold. The South Eltheric Ocean is hardly a frigid wasteland. In any event, this seat looks fit for royalty. A prince or high-ranking cleric perhaps?"
"15453358-1-299";"Alas, I think the Bretons plundered most of these monolithic ivories after the sack of Orsinium in 1E 980. The Daggerfall ivory trade helped fuel the Bjoulsae economic expansion that catapulted High Rock to prominence in the centuries that followed."
"15453358-1-300";"Yes, prior to its dissolution by House Dorell, House Spenard's territory was in a perpetual state of famine. Frestrien Spenard I to Frestrien Spenard VI maintained an era of misrule that lasted for one-hundred eighty-six years."
"15453358-1-301";"Is tethering military pomp to religious expression really that odd? For the Yokudans, warfare and religion were practically synonymous! Your comment about the stars does raise questions, though. Ruptga without stars is like Akatosh without a Dragon."
"15453358-1-302";"A fair observation, Ugron. Ra Gada-era sculptors rarely took the time to render softer details like those flowers. Bloody conquest took priority. The lack of orichalc does give me pause, though. Yokudan statuary normally features a metallic element."
"15453358-1-303";"I've traveled with enough Wood Elves to know you should never ask what they put in their pots. If I had to guess, I'd say they probably filled it with bones and viscera. Blood to please Hircine, and bones to honor Y'ffre."
"15453358-1-304";"It's possible, I suppose. They did spend quite a lot of time around volcanoes and heated geysers. Even so, if anyone could learn to harness the power of the cold during wartime, it would be the Dwarves."
"15453358-1-305";"Amalien gives the Dwarves too much credit. As usual. This looks more like a weapon to me. Some kind of complex ballista that could fling projectiles at a distance. This could change the war in Cyrodiil if someone managed to rebuild it."
"15453358-1-306";"Yes, quintessentially Dwemer in its design and application. They were so much more technologically advanced than other races, their mastery over the arcane allowed them to fire shocking projectiles."
"15453358-1-307";"Open your eyes, Gabrielle! This is a treasure trove of Dwarven astronomical scholarship! The three orbiting spheres could be guardian equation-bodies, but we should at least consider the possibility that they are Dwemeric Aetherbell beacons. Right?"
"15453358-1-308";"For once, we agree! Culturally distinct constellations do exist, but the Nedes' conception of the stars mirrors our own in more ways than I can count. Perhaps they meant to re-write the stars in some way? To merge traditional archetypes into new wholes?"
"15453358-1-312";"It's interesting to think about maps drawn before and after the construction of Varen's Wall. Each tell quite a different story about the land and its people!"
"15453358-1-313";"Few places in Tamriel have changed hands more than Craglorn. Just by the sheer amount of different ruins that can be found there, it's hard to tell what perspective this was drawn from."
"15453358-1-314";"Coldharbour is supposed to emulate Nirn itself, but it always surprises me how innocuous it looks when depicted in a map. Those brave enough to document it did so with little bias, it seems."
"15453358-1-315";"Prince Hew set up the first semblances of a city near the harbor on the east side of the peninsula. It wasn't much at first, but over time it transformed into a sprawling commercial port, despite the harsh environment."
"15453358-1-335";"Yeah, we're missing something. See that groove along the inside and these hollows on the top? Curious. Judging by the weight, I'd say this is a knight's ring; a symbol of membership in one of High Rock's older chivalric orders."
"15453358-1-336";"""Vigor through Blood"" was a lesser-known credo of the Pale Order. Their popular motto was, ""victory unaided, death unsung."" Still severe, but it allowed them to sidestep accusations of vampirism — a common charge for vassals of the Spenard dynasty."
"15453358-1-337";"It's the coat of House Aurmine. My research indicates they were eager vassals of the despot king, Festrien Spenard I. But honestly, we only know about them because they patronized a chivalric band called the Knights of the Pale Order."
"15453358-1-338";"The engraving on this band is Cyrodilic. And did you notice the post-script? It reads, ""killed at my hand!"" Ghastly! Knights of the Pale Order supposedly kept lists of all the Direnni warriors and magisters they slayed. This must be an enemy of note."
"15453358-1-339";"Look closer, Ugron. There's writing on them! Mara's mercy, it's tiny. Unless I'm mistaken, the script reads, ""Austerity, Autonomy, and Ferocity."" By the Eight. I bet these fellows were a hoot at palace gatherings."
"15453358-1-340";"It's not High Elf work, Gabrielle. This is Aldmer craftsmanship. Syrabane taught my ancestors how to thread silver like this for talismans and magic pendants. We lost the knack for it though. Classic Altmer, right? We forget all the important stuff!"
"15453358-1-341";"Ouster troubadours sing songs about great Eltheric clams found out in the reefs near Thras and sea-dwelling Ehlnofey with hearts made of pearl. Reginus will claim it's bawdy metaphor, but I think pearls like this might hold real Aurbic power!"
"15453358-1-342";"Those aren't just any freshwater pearls, Reginus. It's a set of Nilumin River Pearls! Aldmer divers called them ""Tears of the Ehlnofey."" Ancient alchemists ground them into powder remedies and some Aldhessia healers even wore them as talismans."
"15453358-1-343";"That clasp belongs to magic necklace. It's wild magic, though. Primordial energy. You only find magic like that in old, old places — rivers and reefs where the Earth Bones never quieted down. I feel the touch of the Ehlnofey on this for sure."
"15453358-1-344";"Aetherquartz! We High Elves use it in all sorts of things, but most notably in our calian spheres and high ascendant jewelry. Curates and mages use ground pumice and ocean sand to smooth them out. These are remarkable. The finest I've ever seen!"
"15453358-1-353";"Hero, or monster? Red Eagle fought a war of brutal raids and bloody atrocities, terrorizing the Imperial soldiers attempting to pacify the Reach in the 11th century of the First Era. By the end of his rebellion slaughter was all that he knew."
"15453358-1-354";"Vampires! Don't you see it? This could confirm that clans once thrived beneath the Reach. I've read accounts of their hidden, mountain bastions being decorated with glass that counteracted dangerous sunlight. Elegant and practical!"
"15453358-1-355";"Safe to assume it wasn't the ancient Reachfolk themselves. This reeks of Imperial pretense. And since there are some pockets of land unlabeled, I'd guess they're the Reachclan strongholds that the Imperials never managed to penetrate."
"15453358-1-356";"Your instincts are correct. Though I would hesitate to call this a weapon. I think it's more tactical than that. See the grooves at the base? That would have easily cut through foliage and made tracks through all kinds of terrain."
"15453358-1-357";"I don't think this is just any mining tool! Look at the engravings. Amalien can correct me if I'm wrong, but these look like Dwemer markings to me. This thing is unique, there's a magical component to it. Or at least there used to be. Any ideas?"
"15453358-1-359";"The map clearly depicts a settlement near present-day Karthald. No great surprise, there. Reachmen and Nords have fought over that stretch of territory since time out of memory. Apparently, the tower is far older than I suspected!"
"15453358-1-375";"That focal shape is clearly a spade—the symbol of the Kothringi God of Agriculture, Z'en. A fascinating deity, that Z'en. We know the Wood Elves swear on him for vengeance's sake. I doubt the Kothringi version keeps blood-debts in his portfolio."
"15453358-1-376";"Idiosyncratic indeed. The boat's design is clearly canoe-like--appropriate given the shallow, narrow waterways of Black Marsh. But why a sail? Taking a boat like this onto the open water would be suicidal, even for sailors as talented as the Kothringi."
"15453358-1-377";"If you're right, we could very well be looking at the spade of a soldier sent to conquer the swamps of Black Marsh during Reman's rule. Apparently he lost more men to the harsh conditions than he did the fighting."
"15453358-1-378";"Gideon was originally founded by the Ayleids, wasn't it? The name of that settlement is sadly lost to time, but perhaps this belonged to one of the first to settle in Black Marsh after leaving greater Cyrodiil."
"15453358-1-380";"What strikes me about this map is that the lines appear to have been drawn in squid ink. See how it faded to brown, like the parchment, rather than gray or black? The use of squid ink suggests a sailing vessel rather than a cartographer's shop."
"15453358-1-381";"The color reminds me of blood. It's also huge. Excessively so. This has Sanguine written all over it. It's so lavish but also unsettling. It feels warm to the touch! Or I might be imagining things."
"15453358-1-382";"I would be less inclined to believe that this was some kind of worry talisman, or a token of good luck. The inscription, though faded, was clearly detailed enough to suggest this was quite an expensive piece. Perhaps from a noble family?"
"15453358-1-383";"While I am not outright horrified by this artifact, I am puzzled by it. I agree that it once belonged to a ring, but I can't determine the make of it. Based on the condition of the materials, I would date this piece somewhere in the mid-First Era?"
"15453358-1-384";"While this is clearly very old, I'm still fascinated to see the prongs separate from whatever they once held. Many rings from the mid-First Era had this kind of crude fastening system with heavy handed smithing, making the prongs near unbreakable."
"15453358-1-385";"Whoever fashioned this ring definitely didn't want it flying off at any provocation. Seems like they eliminated the very possibility. I've never been quite so serious about my own jewelry, but to each their own."
"15453358-1-386";"My eyes aren't what they used to be, but it looks to me like some kind of skeletal motif. It's hard to make out, but if you tilt it on its side, you can see the segments of bone that make up a body. Legs, arms, a face, maybe?"
"15453358-1-387";"Call me crazy, but the little symbol etched into the metal almost looks like it reads ... Lamae Bal. It's pretty faded, so for all I know it could say Lemon Bat! But I wonder if this belonged to--or was made by--a vampire."
"15453358-1-388";"Amalien has the right of it, though I'm not sure this would have been from any kind of armor. See the cracks in the connecting metal? I'd wager this was jewelry once upon a time. This metal wouldn't protect you from much of anything."
"15453358-1-389";"Sharpness like this, even after centuries, suggests this design was intended specifically for intimidation. There's no practical purpose to spikes like this ... other than to make sure everyone knows you're not some toothless runt."
"15453358-1-390";"I find the evolution of clasp-making in history thoroughly fascinating! Anchored clasps like this give a good deal of stability to a piece of jewelry or chain and can still be found in pieces today. It's practically timeless."
"15453358-1-391";"Right you are, Reginus. Though I find the styling more interesting than the source. Note the scalloped edges and parchment-thin cuts. No Argonian leatherworker touched this. This Kothringi craftsmanship! Dating back to the early 2E 200's at least!"
"15453358-1-392";"According to my research, the Kothringi preferred faceted stones because they scattered the light like fish scales. Combined with these prey-feathers, this stone would be a powerful fetish for hunters and harpooners."
"15453358-1-393";"The Kothringi didn't consider these beads clothing. They were wearable instruments! Kothringi measured the worth of most things by their sound. My Argonian friend, Ree-Tei, told me the only reason they wanted gold was because of the clink it made!"
"15453358-1-394";"There was a species of long-legged swamp wolves that went extinct in the 2E 10s. Lost huge numbers during the Great Burn and never recovered. You see a few of their features in the Blackwood dire wolf, though. Must have crossbred a bit."
"15453358-1-395";"The weave of the rope is very tight, but that's not the only source of its strength. I see metallic strands woven into the cord. Kothringi smiths might have been capable of a feat like that, though I've never seen it executed this seamlessly."
"15453358-1-396";"Come now, Ugron. I've never known you to be superstitious. Yes, the skull motif is disquieting from an aesthetic perspective, but Argonians utilize skeletal imagery in many Sithis effigies and idols. This definitely dates back to the xanmeer period."
"15453358-1-397";"They're wraxu feathers! An extinct relative of the Elsweyr terror bird! According to Varid's Guide to Unusual Birds, they grew as tall as mammoths with tails as long as wagon tongues! Alas, they died out during the Reman Incursion's Great Burn, 1E 2830s."
"15453358-1-398";"Verita's right. I'd wager this is a mix of bog iron, nickel, and something else--probably imported. What interests me is these symbols. Plenty of hard angles like you'd see in any xanmeer-period piece, but I don't recognize some of these patterns."
"15453358-1-399";"Not likely. These are pad-sa teeth. Pad-sa sharks are scrappy survivors with a range that goes from freshwater to salty and everything in between. You usually find them far upriver along the coast--from the mouth of the Niben to the Topal Bay."
"15453358-1-400";"They remind me of funerary wraps; the kind you might find securing a bog-blight's mask to its head. I wager these kept a mask in place too. The question is, what kind? The weave is tight and rugged. Not the sort of thing you'd imagine on a priest."
"15453358-1-430";"This appears to be a rod of some kind--not unlike the vine rods our Imperial centurions carry. The Dremora place great emphasis on discipline and order in battle. Perhaps they use this cane to correct wayward varlets?"
"15453358-1-431";"I found a catalogue of Divayth Fyr's early explorations of the Oblivion in the Mages Guild library. He sketched out the heraldry of hundreds of clans. This one appears to belong to the Mindcleaver clan. Not much information beyond the name, though."
"15453358-1-434";"Reginus has a thing for torture devices? That explains a lot. Well, Scholar Buca's weird obsessions notwithstanding, a gibbet like this makes a lot of sense, given the fact that death doesn't scare Daedra. Pain motivates everyone--mortal and Daedra alike!"
"15453358-1-435";"This is the work of a Dremora. You see the ragged edges? The parchment was roughly flensed. From what, I'd rather not speculate. Odd that they'd choose this one region to chart. Gabrielle seems to think the Deadlands are broad beyond comprehension."
"15453358-1-437";"This horn's definitely organic. If I had to guess, I'd say it's a Daedroth horn. Plenty of those crocodile-face brutes wander the Deadlands, and according to Zexelax's Guide to Lesser Daedra, those horns on their head can blunt the sharpest swords!"
"15453358-1-438";"Aye, the smith who hammered these out used voidstone, but I don't think it's voidsteel. This looks like some kind of bespoke alloy--the sort of thing you'd only find in a Daedric realm. This sandy hue and matte finish have me stumped."
"15453358-1-439";"These plates do seem more restrained than the standard Daedric panoply. People often say that Daedra lack imagination, but I think distinctive objects like this prove they're more creative than scholars give them credit for."
"15453358-1-440";"This smells nice because it isn't the work of Dremora! Unless I miss my guess, I'd say a Golden Saint made this. An Aureal, I mean. According to my research, they compulsively polish their armor. As for why you'd find it in the Deadlands? I have no idea."
"15453358-1-441";"I'd like to take a closer look at this at some point. The resilience, durability, and dependability of Daedric materials remains a subject of serious debate in the Guild. What elements of a Daedra corpse endure and which discorporate seems totally random."
"15453358-1-442";"It's hard to make out, but these look like the symbols of Dremora Mindcleaver clan. As far as I know, they were deposed by the Firescourage and Ruinblood clans at some point. Maybe this thing predates that?"
"15453358-1-443";"Aren't the mages of the Ruinblood clan experts in magic that involves blood? That might explain the color. I wonder if that's cosmetic, or genuine. With Dremora, I guess you never know."
"15453358-1-444";"Daedric indeed! These are symbols of the Firescourge clan. They're kind of like foot-soldiers that serve Mehrunes Dagon. Not an imaginative group, but still powerful. I wonder if this was worn by one of their members?"
"15453358-1-445";"You're right about this stone being otherworldly, Reginus. It's a searing stone—a crystalized fragment of Daedric dynamism. I have no idea if it's mined or hand made. No member of the Mages Guild has ever had a chance to study one."
"15453358-1-446";"I think this is made of morpholith! It's a very rare mineral and usually only found in pocket realms of Oblivion. They can only be harvested by Daedra! Most of the time the mineral is unstable, but somehow this one isn't. At least ... I think."
"15453358-1-447";"The symbology is interesting. At first glance, I thought the design was merely twin horns, but upon closer inspection I see it resembles Nibenese depictions of Morihaus--or even Belharza the Man-Bull, scarce though they may be."
"15453358-1-448";"It's almost certainly a diamond of Imperial make. The shape makes that clear enough. The question is, how did it achieve that crimson hue, and why was it in the Deadlands to begin with? Did some Alessian mage pierce the veil on purpose?"
"15453358-1-449";"This band is sturdy. Imperial. It's not a legionary's ring, though. Looks like the sort of thing a forge wife might make herself before her wedding. Heavy, regal, well-polished. Someone important wore this. Based on the location, I'd say a battlemage."
"15453358-1-450";"I think they're too big for Xivilai. These look closer to Colovian minotaur horns to me. I haven't heard much about minotaurs making their way to the Deadlands, if such a thing is even possible. Could it have some connection to Morihaus or Belharza?"
"15453358-1-451";"I'm confident that this substance has arcane properties, but the origin of it is puzzling. The vessel has what looks like the Amulet of Kings etched into it, but I don't recognize these side-elements. Are those horns?"
"15453358-1-460";"Dragons sometimes formed alliances with mortals and gave their allies powerful gifts. The Dragon Nahfahlaar once gave his horn to the Khajiit hero Ja'darri. I suspect this armor might have been a Dragon's gift, too. But to whom?"
"15453358-1-461";"These belong to the sabatons of no ordinary warrior. Only a Nord champion of the highest standing would wear armor forged with a draconic motif. I think it belonged to a previously unknown Dragonborn!"
"15453358-1-462";"The sabatons must have belonged to one of the heroes who came to High Isle with the All Flags Navy in the First Era. People from all over Tamriel joined the expedition to meet the threat of the Sload."
"15453358-1-463";"I'm not so sure that this is of Nord make at all. The Dragons of the early First Era sometimes made alliances with lucky mortals, and bestowed arms and armor as gifts to those who fought at their side."
"15453358-1-464";"Definitely dragonhide. How exciting! I have heard of Dragon fangs and talons used for weapons, but arms and armor crafted from dragonhide are extraordinarily rare. Whoever wore this must have been a mighty hero or a great king indeed!"
"15453358-1-465";"Runes have been etched quite deftly into the soft flesh. Hmm. Hard to make out what this inscription means, but I can make out Hekhem and Meht. Tentative examination suggests it is from a Daedric Watcher."
"15453358-1-466";"I can confirm this unusual relic comes from no creature of Nirn. My assumption is that it might be from a Daedric Watcher, but that would be pure conjecture. I imagine it has a deeply unpleasant smell."
"15453358-1-467";"I contacted a colleague from the Mages Guild to have a look at this. A great deal of magicka was expended during its creation. According to my associate, close examination of the relic could result in a splitting headache and a long bout of aphasia."
"15453358-1-468";"I took a tome on Daedric oddities from the shelf, and by Mauloch, I think the eye followed my hand straight to the text. As if it was reading it. Has to be a Watcher eyeball, right? Right?"
"15453358-1-469";"By examining the edges of this sheathing, I've noted that this skin appears to have been harvested from a living being. Whether this was done willingly or not is hard to tell."
"15453358-1-470";"I met a Redguard in Sentinel who swears that the peak-mines of Hattu Mountain still hold a fortune in jewels like this. Just a matter of getting at them. Hunding Zealots make it hard to get anything done there. Real shame."
"15453358-1-471";"I find the entire Sinistral Mer narrative unconvincing. Lefthanded Elves? What does that even mean? In any case, yes, the Chrysocollas were not just a sign of royalty, but also a symbol of invincibility in battle. Oft enchanted, or so I've read."
"15453358-1-472";"I've seen this shape before. The configuration lends itself to defensive enchantments. You typically find it embossed on shields, but given size, maybe this belonged to a belt? That setting in the center must have supported a massive jewel!"
"15453358-1-473";"I'm no naturalist, but I'd guess this came from a Yath Asp. We're lucky they never made it to Tamriel. The Crowns say they're huge, have a temper like Malooc, and used to serve Lefthanded Elves as pets--and also maybe garments by the looks of it."
"15453358-1-474";"This metal looks like an alloy--nine parts steel and one part orichalcum. Redguards call it Singersteel. According to the myths, the Yokudans used orichalc to drive the Elves out. Maybe the Lefthanders got their hands on a bit of orichalcum as well?"
"15453358-1-475";"I've seen adornments like this before--far too many times. They're Sea Elf charms. Sailors wear them on ankle bracelets, necklaces, and earrings in honor of their disgusting snake-king, Orgnum. Fair warning: They're almost certainly cursed!"
"15453358-1-476";"You're right, Reginus. This is Sea Elf work. According to legend, King Orgnum was the first person on Tamriel to work in silver. He drew it out of the ground like splinters from a wound. Strange, given that he's a creepy vampire wizard!"
"15453358-1-477";"Fairy tales aside, deep black pearls like this have fascinating origins. Some occur naturally, but most come from Maormer pearl farms where Surfpeelers insert snake scales into Pyandonean Snap-Mussels. It's an interesting--if unsettling--process."
"15453358-1-478";"I've never studied smaller shards of meteoric glass working in concert, but it's possible that stringing these beads together on a magical conductor--an enchanted chain, for instance--they might exhibit power comparable to a larger, intact shard!"
"15453358-1-479";"I saw a gem like this at the College of Sapiarchs once. It was part of a collection of focal relics—items that magnify perception or dampen unruly phenomena during rituals. Maybe this aids with concentration? I could use something like that!"
"15453358-1-480";"You came close to the truth, Reginus, as usual. This appears to be some kind of petrified wood. Difficult to tell what kind based on its size, but given the terrain, I'd hypothesize that it's some manner of oak."
"15453358-1-481";"The stone's larimar. Merchants in Daggerfall call it sea-stone because of the color. So far as I'm aware, it only exists in the Systres archipelago. Makes it very expensive and very, very rare. As far as the etchings are concerned, I'm stumped."
"15453358-1-482";"You see this grinding method in pre-Direnni High Rock antiquities--mostly in cookware, though, not jewelry. Whoever made it was a true master of both stonecraft and magic. It radiates protective energies. Something akin to a shielding spell."
"15453358-1-483";"Do you smell that? It's odoriferous oak resin. Some people call it the Tears of Y'ffre. Wood Elves argue about whether Green Pact permits its use, but nature worshipers in Summerset and High Rock use it all the time in Jephre-worshiping ceremonies."
"15453358-1-484";"We often see volcanic jewelry coming out of the Systres--part of the druidic tradition, I'm told. They hold their Mount Firesong, in very high esteem. Whoever wore a ring with these flakes inlaid must have been a figure of import."
"15453358-1-510";"Stonelore Druids call sculptures like this storystones. They depict major figures in their ruling council, the Draoife, mark major events, and some even serve as stargazing tools, though I've never seen one used in that way."
"15453358-1-511";"The traditional serpent head design is also absent. I believe this is a helm from the fleet of Admiral Uhlchesis, a cultist of Hermaeus Mora and scourge of the Eltheric Ocean."
"15453358-1-512";"See that smudge in the corner? It looks like there was something drawn there! The basic outline isn't familiar, perhaps a druid made it? Their symbols put even Aldmeri runes to shame in terms of intricacy!"
"15453358-1-513";"A fair assessment, my friend, but what of the broader socio-political context of this item? My people committed some truly barbarous acts during their time as rulers of the Systres Archipelago. Does that not bear mentioning?"
"15453358-1-514";"Observe, too, how they've explored the concept of the True Way through various symbolic imagery. The transition between pre-circle and post-circle culture is still evident, with some elements disappearing even a few years after this piece was made."
"15453358-1-517";"If only there had been academics on hand when the armada returned from the final confrontation. Think of the knowledge we could have gained! We know the Sload are extremely skilled in magics, is it possible that this crystal was once a ritual implement?"
"15453358-1-518";"A representation of the Eldertide sacred seed, I believe! I visited a druid site on High Isle once and saw many of these chits being made by hand. Though these days they are mostly baubles for tourists, I expect."
"15453358-1-520";"I've seen something like this before, and I'm sorry to say that I don't believe it's Daedric in origin, Amalien. It is rare, however. I believe this to be from the hide of a Faun, the beastfolk found in the Systres."
"15453358-1-521";"Looks like it was connected to a larger piece, but I don't think this was for practical purposes. This wouldn't protect you, at least not in the traditional sense like a steel cuirass might. Magical protections? Sure. But that's not my forte."
"15453358-1-522";"I've read old accounts from hunters in the Systres that markings like this are meant to warn others of a Faun Lord's territory. We don't know enough about their dialect to say for certain what those symbols actually mean other than for us to stay away."
"15453358-1-523";"Look closely, if you examine past the carvings you can see a ring in each clasp. I believe that indicates bone. These are made from antlers. Given how the bone formation falls off in certain places, I'd guess the original sample was quite large."
"15453358-1-524";"Oh, oh! I know what this is! Fauns, the big beastfolk around the Systres, they used to grow this kind of hair on their...shins? Is that the right term? Old depictions of them usually had it growing up from their hooves."
"15453358-1-525";"Why does only one of the clay disks have this important symbol? There are three druidic circles and three disks. It stands to reason that the True Way appears on the disc representing the circle of the druid wearing it."
"15453358-1-526";"Verita, you just assume the knots stand for man and mer? Could they not also symbolize Bretons and druids? Or civilization and nature? The druids honor many dichotomies. Oh! It could be Y'ffre and Ehlnofey!"
"15453358-1-527";"If your theory is correct, Ugron, then the promise braided into these strips of leather is one of unity. Some of the braids contain four strands, perhaps there was a fourth circle that is more secretive than the Firesong."
"15453358-1-528";"Druids? Kill the wraiths? Amalien you know about the druids, do you honestly believe that they would fight a creature of nature? No, these brambles must be a type of grass. It's probably good protection and insulation."
"15453358-1-529";"I know of no bone that is knotted or any myth of the Aedra to mention knots. Reginus, question whether your translation is accurate, are you certain these aren't Knotted Roots? That would make more sense given the image."
"15453358-1-530";"Very true. Whenever you're dealing with a piece like this, determining whether it's a primary-source creation from an alchemical process. Old Syrabane in action again! Or made from a reclaimed chunk of Thrassian material is a useful step."
"15453358-1-531";"I agree. Consider too, the broader implications of silverweaving in Aldmeri culture. The purity, the disconnect from broad Tamriel norms. Whatever this stitching was intended for, clearly it was highly valued by the crafter."
"15453358-1-532";"I'm not familiar with any cultures that make regular use of pearlwater in ceremonies, though most sea-faring groups do make use of oceanic byproducts. The aesthetic effect is quite pleasant. Verita, what mystical implications might this have?"
"15453358-1-533";"The materials, as well! Gold, frog metal, silver, stahlrim. Needlessly complex, but quite potent from an arcane perspective. If I had to guess, these metals were chosen as much for their symbolic properties as for their physical ones."
"15453358-1-534";"The fact that Indrik was used indicates either this piece was connected to a sacred relic of Aldmeri faith, or perhaps just that the crafter had access to a dead Indrik. Either way, it's a unique opportunity to study the material properties of the hide."
"15453358-1-535";"I think it's safe to localize this map's creation as taking place during the ""Green Years"" of the Systres. Note the prominence of Vastyr, a settlement that represents harmony between druids and mainlanders to this day. No comment on the married couple."
"15453358-1-536";"Honestly, I thought it far more likely this would be some alloy pressed into an ovoid shape by volcanic pressure. I've asked some of my old friends at the University to consult, quite a find indeed."
"15453358-1-537";"It's entirely possible that this was used in a shipyard, Reginus. I'm no expert, but the wear and tear on this surface doesn't seem typical of a typical drafting table. Some aggressive woodworking was done on this thing. I'm surprised it tilts!"
"15453358-1-542";"A wooden plate with a stained looping symbol? I'm surprised your mind went to Alik'r and not Balfiera, Urgon. This plate is clearly druidic, though I must confess that I don't think I've seen this symbol on any pre-diaspora druidic artifacts."
"15453358-1-543";"Impressive architecture? I question the structural integrity of those columns. One maelstrom or blizzard and clay foundations become brittle. The windows in their towers are ingenious though. They could help funnel fresh air throughout the village."
"15453358-1-544";"I know this tune! It's 'The Waves Crashed Over Aldmeris.' I guess I never thought to connect the two before, but it seems pretty likely that the one you know Gabrielle, evolved from the Elder Folk. How could it not? They're so similar!"
"15453358-1-545";"In seeing this key, my first thought was not to remark on the potential magical properties but instead to wonder at why it was made from copper in the first place. Druids do not usually craft with metals, certainly not copper. This is going to plague me."
"15453358-1-546";"I wondered who was playing that music. I found myself doing the same and thumbing this comb while I researched it. I'm no expert on music, but the scale doesn't sound like anything I've heard or seen before."
"15453358-1-547";"It's disorienting, but given the ink and the paper I would surmise that this was penned by a mortal hand. Given what happens to mortals when they spend too long in Oblivion, I suspect the phenomenon known as ""the Drain"" might play a factor here."
"15453358-1-548";"See the design along the legs? Ugron could speak to this better than I, but it seems reminiscent of designs of the All Flags Navy. Could it have been left behind from one of the crews after the signing? Or just made by one of the laborers that stayed?"
"15453358-1-549";"I believe this is actually part of some kind of work station. The grooves in the bottom of the tray are indicative of a great deal of use, they're worn by time and rough treatment. Not delicate enough for cooking, or anything artistic, I'd imagine."
"15453358-1-557";"The Dark Elf priesthood is a mystery to me, especially prior to Tribunal-era cultural norms, but this strikes me as quite similar to some early Necrom-region vestments I've seen before. It's also one of the least ugly Dunmer garments I've seen."
"15453358-1-558";"Incredible what the Dark Elves can do with these little bugs. This garment is obviously ceremonial, but as with all ashlands garb it's functional as some measure of protective armor. For clergy in dark places, no doubt."
"15453358-1-559";"Dark Elves are so unlike my own people. Ornament where we would make things functional. The reverence for death sewn into the details of this stole screams Necrom to me, but I suppose it could be related to a lesser city of the dead somewhere else."
"15453358-1-560";"I have never once looked at a netch and considered its parts fit for clothing. A lack of imagination on my part, I suppose. Micro-runes carved into these clasps seem to indicate a connection to Dark Elf death culture. Fascinating."
"15453358-1-561";"No simple clergy, this, just as you say Reginus. I believe this was for an Archcanon of the Dark Elf ancestor cult. I recognize some of the micro-runes. The way that the Elves of Morrowind view death is endlessly fascinating to me."
"15453358-1-562";"Nothing I've thrown at this will dent it. Fire, ice, poison, acid, crushing, smashing, blades ... this surface has been made safe against every test I had. I understand strong armor, but why?"
"15453358-1-563";"That would have been a missed opportunity. This was woven with a complex set of fibers that seemed to resist everything my students came up with to test its properties. It made for an entertaining lecture, at least."
"15453358-1-564";"I think collaboration might be a strong word. I've found some supporting Thrassian documentation to indicate contractual workings for mages of great power in other cultures. Still, a unique find."
"15453358-1-565";"While we know the Dwemer made a variety of constructs to integrate with mortal frames, it's extremely rare to find any left behind after their departure. These joints most likely helped the wearer bear up under heavy loads, or move across uneven terrain."
"15453358-1-566";"I believe this is originally from a Harvester, you can see where the scales sat upon the serpent body. But I share your confusion, perhaps one of the lost cultures? Ayleid?"
"15453358-1-567";"That's because this ribbon is an extraordinarily well preserved example of ancient silk. With the proper baths and treatments, ancestor silk can last centuries. I don't recognize the pattern, though."
"15453358-1-568";"It's palladium. A rare ore much-loved by Ayleid jewelers for its luster and durability. The ancient High Elves weren't the only ones who admired birds."
"15453358-1-569";"The three-ring loop is a triquetra. It symbolizes land, sea, and sky. This one appears to be an amulet or medallion of great age, although it's missing the central stone."
"15453358-1-570";"Note how the prongs intended to secure the missing stone are cleverly disguised as delicate wings. I imagine this was part of a pendant or amulet, but we have neither the base nor the jewel."
"15453358-1-571";"A welkynd stone? How exciting! It's said that each welkynd came from a star that fell from the sky. Imagine that--a piece of Aetherius in your hand! The Ayleids greatly prized them."
"15453358-1-572";"What exquisite craftsmanship! Strong as steel, yet supple. The sword motif suggests this was a necklace or pendant belonging to a noble military commander. An ancient Hortator, surely!"
"15453358-1-573";"A common design element, perhaps. But the workmanship is far from common, my friend. Nor is this your typical gold. It is a rare gold alloy invented by the jewelsmiths of ancient Morrowind."
"15453358-1-574";"That red-hued gold is a Chimer alloy dating back to early Morrowind. It fell out of use by the War of the First Council. The stylized technique, however, reminds me of ancient Altmer work."
"15453358-1-575";"Beetles symbolized knowledge to the ancient Chimer. And shalks, with their sharp mandibles and fiery spit, symbolized dangerous knowledge--magic. This amulet was meant to ward off pernicious spells."
"15453358-1-576";"I can identify the gemstone. It's a lucent, a crystal found in the planes of Oblivion. They have the curious ability to store and discharge magicka. Some Daedric devices make use of lucents."
"15453358-1-577";"And the ink. That looks like squid ink. And the parchment itself has a faint aroma of salt. I'd say that this is a nautical chart, and an ancient one at that. The name Necrom isn't used here, but there was definitely a settlement already flourishing."
"15453358-1-578";"Ah, my dear Reginus, what you miss is the etchings along the side of the glass. They're faint, but they indicate that the provenance of the item goes back to the early days of the Necrom Abbey, perhaps to Prior Durdryn himself."
"15453358-1-579";"Indeed! It is a black-figure ceramic with a dried red clay foundation. The figures are etched into the clay and painted black before firing, with highlights of red and white pigment. Definitely Chimer origins, not the later Dunmer."
"15453358-1-588";"Given its wispmetal construction, I'd say be careful of what it winds up or opens since it likely originates from Apocrypha. Perhaps it's a portal key of some sort to that realm?"
"15453358-1-589";"I've run into these before in a ruined temple to Mora, neatly placed on a copy of Musica Ephemera. Sadly, a tomeshell nearby took the book after I moved the cubes off it. Maybe they're wards of some sort?"
"15453358-1-598";"If you hold it up to the light, you can see a faint arcanist's rune. I think it means ""move away."" Is this some sort of repelling device that only arcanists can use?"
"15453358-1-599";"It's cut into a cabochon and almost flawless. Yet, I see a rune inside it, almost as if it's floating. The artistry and magical skill needed to form this gemstone is prodigious. Could an artistic arcanist have crafted this stone?"
"15453358-1-600";"It is a bit odd to see mechanisms using materials from Apocrypha, but there must be a purpose to it. Perhaps the device required certain similar resonances within its metal workings. So, sound-oriented?"
"15453358-1-601";"Possible. More likely Hermaeus Mora chose to do a little redecorating. He has the power to do that, you know. Still, the major landmarks are all here, but I would not use it to give someone directions."
"15453358-1-602";"After some extensive alteration magic and a few sleepless nights, we've been able to strengthen the bindings of this beautifully ornate book. I daresay I have a few more sleepless nights ahead of me as I delve into the tome's contents."
"15453358-1-603";"I'm inclined to agree. It is likely a creature of this size and complexity would've favored a more forgiving organic material. Perhaps something like cartilage? It would be far easier to heal than bone, and certainly lighter."
"15453358-1-604";"Yes, it is certainly a sight to behold. Its size aside, it reminds me of the crawlers that would scurry from beneath the upturned rocks of my youth. In fact, if you'll permit a bit of childish curiosity, I say we send this specimen to Ugron."
"15453358-1-605";"I'll preface this by saying this is far beyond my area of expertise, but is it possible that Tamrielic nautili are stray visitors from Apocrypha? Perhaps the little ones are pulled into our plane by some primordial tide?"
"15453358-1-606";"Note to self, while eating lunch a few yards away from the dig site, I realized that the curvature of the fossil reminded me of a standing caterpillar. Additionally, the curled horns seem similar to barb like defensive growths on larval insects."
"15453358-1-607";"It is truly astounding how much character has been captured by this taxidermist. At times it really does feel like this Cliff Strider will spring to life right in the middle of my study. I'll have to keep them in mind for future projects."
"15453358-1-608";"An impressive find, Reginus. How old do you posit this glass art to be? It's worth noting how the Tribunal is shown as being in equal balance. A clue to its origin being a place of organized worship rather than a personal or private creation."
"15453358-1-609";"Look closely at the stone enclosure and you'll see lines worn away on the exterior. They appear organically arranged. Perhaps where roots grew around it? Suggests that this existed underground for a significant period."
"15453358-1-610";"Unmistakably the influence of Hermeus Mora, but I agree that it poses no threat. I passed my hand through the haze and it didn't appear to acknowledge my presence. I don't think this was an actual sacrificial well, but a iconic replica."
"15453358-1-611";"I do not often suggest caution when examining our findings, but I must insist we stay clear. These sorts of punctures are used by cultists to bring creatures into our realm. The First Era Graykeepers of Skyrim used these wells for combat often."
"15453358-1-612";"Nice guess! However, the frame holds its shape using coherence energies specific to Namira or Hermaeus Mora. A minor Namira cult in Western Skyrim called the Night Knives rimmed their tables with similar shadows."
"15453358-1-613";"Did you know that glass handicraft goes back into the Merethic era? Early versions used obsidian which gave it a darker hue than what we expect today. Given the inky appearance, I believe this pane to be made of that polished crystal."
"15453358-1-614";"Many cultures used stone, not just the Dwarves. That said, these were constructed using ancient tools is correct. Look at the curve of each leg - they aren't exact, even if you account for age. The craftsmen did not have the tools for precision."
"15453358-1-625";"Interesting. This container held some form of glyphic. See how the inkwood has a slight purple sheen to it? I've seen this kind of discoloration when this type of wood is exposed to a glyphic for a period of time."
"15453358-1-626";"This metal most certainly is imbued! And these runeforms indicate sound manipulation of some sort. As if when matched with another rune, a sound would ring out."
"15453358-1-627";"I see a tiny symbol on the edge - a golden eye. Of course that points right to the Keeper of Forbidden Knowledge. What use would Mora's adherents have for this bit of metal, though? I agree it must be part of a larger item."
"15453358-1-628";"The unusual coating on this gear must be from an unguent arcanists use to strengthen tome bindings. If you ever see a row of books with a strange mauve shimmer to them, chances are an arcanist bound them in Apocrypha. Oh to have such a volume!"
"15453358-1-629";"If it has anything to do with burial chambers, whatever was buried must have been extremely tiny. In other words, I think this belongs to a mechanism of some kind. Not a tomb. And not Dwemer given the nature of the metal."
"15453358-1-630";"Seeker claws would have also been ideal for another reason: their arcane resilience. Their claws would not have been corroded by watcher ink or other magical elements used in the writing of enchanted texts."
"15453358-1-631";"That makes sense, Gabrielle, but everything in Apocrypha has some larger purpose. I posit that even in trace amounts, this watcher ink was used for writing important arcane texts."
"15453358-1-633";"Fighting tactics. This must have been situated at the heart of a battle, perhaps an abandoned mine or crypt. The Khajiiti warriors would have have used this to gain the high ground and strike at their enemy."
"15453358-1-634";"Perhaps, but you can see how modern Breton structures focus on practicality rather than estoric forms. The endless ""men vs. mer"" argument. Either way, I sometimes find myself gazing at the grandeur of their creations."
"15453358-1-635";"I've done some reading and can't find a specific legend or folktale that would seem to relate to this symbol. I wonder if this was meant to evoke a specific concept or was this more esoterica?"
"15453358-1-636";"You can see clearly where the Velothi influence has shaped this altar. These are usually seen in temples or tombs, but I believe this might have spent some time outdoors in a Dunmeri necropolis."
"15453358-1-637";"It's very interesting to me you immediately leapt to the Frog-Pipes. The role of these amphibians in Argonian culture is something I find both delightful and fascinating."
"15453358-1-638";"Perhaps a Dibella sect local to this region? The modern Gold Coast enjoys lavish luxuries, but perhaps this group was more frugal."
"15453358-1-639";"And yet it still functions when removed from the greater whole. The designs of Sotha Sil are unbelievable. Literally, I do not believe this. How does this thing work?"
"15453358-1-640";"I sense the lingering presence of magicka in the crystal. Not just a light source. Perhaps some kind of defense mechanism?"
"15453358-1-641";"This brushed metal is coated with an alloy that keeps it from pitting or allowing disease to flourish. An ingenious usage of materials, and one used for centuries in that part of the world."
"15453358-1-642";"The wood and stone seem to be well maintained, most likely using local customs and materials."
"15453358-1-643";"This was brought in its entirety from the Deadlands and re-assembled just as it was in the field. This casual manner of storing such vile treasures is challenging."
"15453358-1-647";"Best temper your sight and self, Amalein, for it might blind what's truly here. What we can learn about Apocryphal design."
"15453358-1-648";"Another one of your games, Reginus? A skim through my fingers tells me it's definitely not magicka, and yet the feeling is somehow familiar."
"15453358-1-649";"The finishing and texture don't match the other Apocryphic relics we've found at all. Either that, or someone never bothered to finish with a polish."
"15453358-1-650";"The One Who Knows holds secrets and truths of Tamriel's history, perhaps even Nirn, that are beyond our understanding. Certainly, beyond mine."
"15453358-1-651";"Perhaps the beads of light hold malachite to absorb magicka? Elven armor is embroidered with it in Summerset."
"15453358-1-652";"The additional context helps here. This may have been an ancient grave marker for Mora's faithful, given the permanence of the stone carving and the tentacular design. More research is needed on the burial customs of Apocrypha."
"15453358-1-653";"Reginus is right, there's still a strong arcane energy emanating from within. I believe this fragment may have been used as a grounding anchor for spellwork, or perhaps as a way to mark confluences of energy within Apocrypha."
"15453358-1-654";"I'm no expert on arcane research, I'll leave that to Gabrielle, but it seems the use of Mora's eye here denotes a connection between the Prince himself and the user. Perhaps something to do with understanding the Prince's vision for the world?"
"15453358-1-655";"I've tried to decipher the title of this book, but it's written in a script that defies analysis. Since Hermaeus Mora's ancient followers could hail from anywhere in Tamriel, I'm not optimistic about about my prospects."
"15453358-1-656";"I agree with Ugron, this page looks like an attempt to organize important information. Moreover, the paper itself is resistant to arcane tampering. I got very little out of it when I tried to examine its magical qualities."
"15453358-1-657";"The loss of the cover also appears to have saved this text from the tomeshells. Without a hard cover, the bare manuscript wouldn't have been much use as a home for them!"
"15453358-1-658";"Ancient followers of Hermaeus Mora may have tied their emotions to the shifting colors. Perhaps it was actually a locus for meditation, reflecting their mood or mindset externally."
"15453358-1-659";"Strange symbols rising from a fire, Apocryphal tentacles. Have you tried asking an Arcanist?"
"15453358-1-660";"Hard to say for sure that Mora had a hand in this. Perhaps some natural process created this situation? After all, they're so cute."
"15453358-1-661";"Entry 2: After consulting Ugron and dismissing his word of caution for the sake of an Antiquarian's pursuit of knowledge, I decided to apply pressure to one of its surfaces and discovered it diffuses colored light!"
"15453358-1-662";"I've seen stranger in some of the dark places beneath Tamriel. My guess? Someone had a lot of time on their hands."
"15453358-1-663";"I don't believe they're cause for alarm. I have only minor facility with magic, but perhaps the tentacles are ritualistic in some way?"
"15453358-1-664";"A mind doesn't mean free will, Reginus. The movement seems controlled, like it's observing us as we're observing it."
"15453358-1-665";"While it is probable this creature didn't have legs as we know them, Ugron, the curvature of the ribs suggests an unusual anatomy. Perhaps this was one of the many levitating creatures of Apocrypha?"
"15453358-1-666";"Verita offers a correct, if shallow analysis. The lack of teeth in this fossil means the slug had to break down its food some other way. If its biology is anything like the creatures of Tamriel, it may have used a digestive acid to consume its food."
"15453358-1-667";"I'd like to point out that what appears to be preserved vines are actually fossilized tentacles. Apocrypha's ecology has very little true plant life, as most of the organisms have been infused with vast quantities of arcane energy over time."
"15453358-1-668";"Gabrielle, this is in fact a kind of biological node. Note the tentacular formations around the so-called trunk and the bulbous growth at the top. It could be the sensory organ of a yet-undiscovered species!"
"15453358-1-669";"These are not gloves, Amalien. They are the inner lining for a pair of armored gauntlets. You can tell by the grommets and reinforced panels where armor plates would be attached. Yet I am not familiar with the style."
"15453358-1-670";"This is aetherium, one of the rarer forms of aetherial fragment. It is only found in the caverns beneath Skyrim. How glass that falls from the sky winds up underground, I could not say. The Dwemer powered many devices with crystals such as these."
"15453358-1-671";"I have seen similar etching tools in the Nedic ruins of Hammerfell. Many Nede artisans salvaged tools left behind by the Dwemer of Volenfell after the Dwarves disappeared. They were far better than anything the Nedes could craft for themselves."
"15453358-1-672";"Not a piece of a machine, but a piece of armor. The length and the curvature are a good match for a muscular forearm, and the articulated section aligns with the wrist. I believe this is a Dwemer vambrace, but I'm afraid it's incomplete."
"15453358-1-673";"The decorative element is actually quite functional. When I tap the pipes with a hammer, they ring like a bell. I suspect they were fitted to an armor plate or the casing of a mechanism. Something to do with Dwemer tonal magic, perhaps?"
"15453358-1-674";"I wouldn't just call this ""quite magical,"" but extremely magical. I believe this stitching is made from creatia, the very substance, the substrate, of the Daedric Realms. Evergloam, I'd guess, given they seem to be made from the shadows themselves."
"15453358-1-675";"It strikes me as odd that there would be runes for successful hunts etched into the inside of these leathers. Unless the wearer didn't want to give their intentions away, or they didn't want to show an allegiance to Hircine."
"15453358-1-676";"Materials from Nocturnal's realm have strange effects here on Mundus. Darkling mana makes paint so black no light escapes from it and court fletched arrows never fly where they're aimed. It's not beyond reason to think these rivets have odd properties."
"15453358-1-677";"Verita would hate this, but I spread a drop of some of this oil on a rag I use for keeping my chair in good condition. I didn't think anything would happen, but then the rag darkened. I think this oil imbues whatever it contacts with shadows. '"
"15453358-1-678";"I am not a fan of poetry. Still, I admit that the poems stole my focus. I lost an entire days work in their pages. When I finished, I found a feather tucked into the last page that I do not remember seeing there before."
"15453358-1-679";"I quite like transfixing. Definitely Daedric, but the links are made from an alchemical admixture of saltwater. The tomes I referenced indicate there are only a few realmic bodies that might fit the bill. Notes back to you Amalien."
"15453358-1-680";"An excellent observation. And quite true, these were done by a follower of a Prince with pretensions of normalcy. Or delusions. Hmm. These micro-runes also contain a surprising amount of magickal power."
"15453358-1-681";"This relic sat on my desk as I worked on other artifacts, and I would swear this thing is looking at me. Making strange faces. I wouldn't mention it in an official note I had not caught it trying to sneak a peek at my notes on its Dark Seducer twin."
"15453358-1-682";"One artisan clearly was an arrogant master of their craft. They took extravagant glee in showing off their skill, though the half of the yoke they've made seems somewhat sterile as a result."
"15453358-1-683";"After some odd comments from colleagues I took up outside my office after hours to read a book and listen. A strange sort of lilting song started up as dusk settled in. I confirmed it with my own eyes, this cameo sings when no one is around to observe it."
"15453358-1-684";"You'll note, Reginus, that this decanter is also quite large. It could easily have held several bottles of wine. This wasn't used for average meals, but large feasts and celebrations. It's a centerpiece of sorts."
"15453358-1-685";"While my own knowledge of ancient beauty practices is limited, I don't think this mirror was purely for superficial purposes. The carvings around the glass suggest a religious purpose to me. Perhaps a symbolic way of looking within oneself?"
"15453358-1-687";"While the map does depict the West Weald, it is definitely not of Colovian make. Redguard maps frequently use this style of coloration and goatskin vellum. Merchants from Hammerfell could use this to navigate trade routes."
"15453358-1-688";"You should double-check your research as this is decidedly of Imperial crafting. Colovia, in particular. We've found tapestries of similar color and design across the region. This quality of weaving implies it hung in one of the local estates."
"15453358-1-689";"It may surprise you to hear that it doesn't depict a real location at all. I believe this is a scene from that old tale of The Gentle Prince. Those trees are exactly as Colovian retelling describes. The Prince wandered that forest looking for love."
"15453358-1-690";"I agree with your analysis, Reginus, though which estate could it be? That type of architecture came into fashion during the Second Empire, and that vine work has always been popular. However, I don't recognize the region."
"15453358-1-691";"I'm more interested in the story behind the painting than the trees in it. There aren't many folktales that this fresco could be showing but I think it's either the 'Lady of the Vine' or 'The Widow's Bull'. Both originated in Colovia around 2E 107."
"15453358-1-692";"That vibrant red comes from crushed hot peppers imported from Esroniet. They were unbelievably popular in Cyrodiil around 2E 53. I found evidence of a growing Sanguine cult gaining footholds in the Imperial City at the time as well."
"15453358-1-693";"I know that Aylied's held trees in high regard. There are known symbols of knowledge which include threes and branches. I haven't seen a tree sculpture in any of the ruins I've been to, but it does not seem out of place for this to carry the same meaning."
"15453358-1-694";"See how the tree grows right out of the base? I'm certain this was cast all at once from Meteoric Iron. The Ayleids used Aetherial materials a lot in their construction. Meteoric Iron binds really well to the stone used in their carvings."
"15453358-1-695";"Gwylim has a similar sculpture. I once pointed out how similar Ayleid and Aldmeri architecture are and was met with glares from students. I wonder if they're even aware of who our founder is."
"15453358-1-696";"I treated those that brought it here to some mead. Many Ayleid ruin structures hold meteoric iron, but part of me feels that this one's eerie grandeur was meant to be flaunted outside. Not a ruin."
"15453358-1-697";"Of course! Welkynd stores magical energy. The dials help distribute the energy and act as pockets for them. To peer into other realms, maybe? Perhaps the magic was too great and caused the cracks?"
"15453358-1-698";"Alessia and her rebellion were quick to attack. Creating a weapon with something they knew little about would be impractical. This must be when they were just testing its capabilities."
"15453358-1-699";"An astute observation from Gabrielle, but the cut of this slab is what intrigues me. It's certainly not natural - perhaps it had some use among historic Nedic peoples."
"15453358-1-700";"You know, it's not uncommon for cracks like these to form on smithing stands that have been exposed to the enormous heat and pressure of sustained use. It's the sign of a successful smith and enviable craftsmanship."
"15453358-1-701";"It's not just about strength, though many may believe so. The addition of differing ores and decoctions can also increase the flexibility of a tool. An important characteristic, unless you want your sword to shatter the first time you hit something."
"15453358-1-702";"It's the strangest thing. I've been studying the carvings on this bracing, and I still can't make it out. It's non-reactive to any spells I've tried on it. I need to dig deeper. There must be some ancient form of magicka I've overlooked!"
"15453358-1-703";"Good start, but there's more here. The shape of the anvil itself is reminiscent of the Wild Elves. This smith may have had a penchant for imbuing their creations with nature magic. Magical farming tools, maybe?"
"15453358-1-704";"I practically had to pry this out of Reginus's hands. But it was worth it. There are some notches on the back that suggest this item wasn't an object of worship itself, but part of a larger piece. I suspect it may be a sculpture or art piece."
"15453358-1-705";"Reginus wanted me to look at this one. The craftsmanship is apparent, even with age. Looks to me like a miniature carved pillar. It could have something to do with Ayleid tombs or burial customs. More study is needed."
"15453358-1-706";"Perhaps the shattering was intentional? A meditation on the perils of vanity and selfishness? There's something about this mirror that doesn't sit right with me. It's cracked, but how have all the pieces stayed together over the years?"
"15453358-1-707";"I've never seen Ugron so grumpy as when I noticed the tiny metal keys hidden beneath the gears. They're aligned for the gears to hit them, but I'm not sure what will happen when they do. We're still missing something."
"15453358-1-708";"Reginus was right on his second guess. It's a key or trigger of some kind. The teeth at the other end from the crystal certainly make it seem it should lock into place somehow. The Ayleids never cease to surprise me."
"15453358-1-709";"Such a curious little wheel! Reginus is right about its oddly shifting weight. The jade gem holds a simple magic: when someone spins this wheel, it stays in motion until stopped. Who would need such a thing?"
"15453358-1-710";"I've found shallow pans like this inside old Dwemer ruins, typically near areas where they built constructs. I assume they're related to the metalwork Dwarves were known for. Could this be evidence of Dwemer residing in Apocrypha?"
"15453358-1-711";"One could produce food, though that's not the intended purpose. This stove can achieve very high levels of heat that would over-char your nightly leg of lamb. No, this device is meant for smelting metals. See how it attaches to a larger fixture?"
"15453358-1-712";"An excellent inference, Ugron, though these aren't for blades. Jewelry artisans use lapidary wheels like this for cutting and polishing gemstones. A row of them like this would be used by quite an expert."
"15453358-1-713";"Don't leap to conclusions about these decorations. Many cults adorn their tools with Mora's symbol. But for reverence, not power. The ancient Enraptured Order would drape octopuses across worktables as a sign of respect."
"15453358-1-714";"You should train with my clan, Reginus. They carry heavier furniture than this without any pain. Though, did you notice it belongs to a larger piece? I wonder if it was even meant to be moved."
"15453358-1-715";"We shouldn't discount simple high-quality craftsmanship. It's likely not even brass but some less common metal more suitable to sustaining heavy weight. These iron entanglements may help with support."
"15453358-1-716";"I've seen similar stone coffins in my explorations, and I agree with the comparison. Not quite sure how to describe the sensation, but it feels dead. Have you noticed how cold it is to the touch?"
"15453358-1-717";"An interesting supposition, though we'd have to test it for Daedric emanations. However, it does remind me of displays used by jewelers to show off their wares."
"15453358-1-718";"Unsurprising that they look like eyes since Hermaeus Mora worshipers designed them. Decorative pieces like these appear on a number of furnishings and weaponry recovered from cultist bases. But are these more than decorative?"
"15453358-2-77";"The Direnni had some of the most powerful mages in the world at the height of their reign. Maybe they weren't just changing the maps? What if their Camlorn really did disappear? Like the Dwemer? Or Artaeum? Maybe we'll find it! Wouldn't that be something?"
"15453358-2-78";"It may never have been built. I doubt a treacherous ruler like Jolie would have tolerated Orcs for neighbors even if Golkarr was established peacefully. The justification for the razing of Orsinium was likely just the first of Jolie's many betrayals."
"15453358-2-79";"The stewardship of these assorted baronies and counties was at the pleasure of the king. Holdings of the nobility would have shifted constantly as individuals gained or fell out of favor. These drafts may be as close to final as was possible."
"15453358-2-80";"I've spoken at length with nomad tribal chieftains. Most claim that the dunerippers we see now are a fraction of the size of those the first Ra Gada encountered. Could be a correlation, but any evidence has long been weathered away by shifting sands."
"15453358-2-81";"If it was prior to the Siege of Orsinium, it was probably after the exodus of Orcs and Goblins in 1E 874. That narrows the fall of Ojwambu and establishment of Hallin's Stand to the seventy-four years between! We're close!"
"15453358-2-82";"If that's true, then pity the poor cartographer who needed to redraw this map only a few years later. Morrowind pushed hard to expel the Nords. Empires based on brutality rarely last long."
"15453358-2-83";"The idea that a cartographer managed to create a map in these conditions defies credulity. Red Mountain's eruption, the end of the First Council's war, the curse of Azura .... An artist probably rendered this as a historical map a hundred years later."
"15453358-2-84";"You may be right. There are stories of an enormous battle between local Argonians and the Barsaebic Ayleids for control of the land where they'd construct Silyanorn. A shame that they could not live together in peace."
"15453358-2-85";"I'm reminded of one: There's an old Nordic legend about how the hero Wuundig fought a mighty Daedra here and melted it with a flaming hammer. The hot springs of Eastmarch are what's left of the monster."
"15453358-2-86";"Giant burial grounds are less interesting than you might think. They take few belongings to the grave, and their kin do not tend the place where they are laid. You'll find little more than large bones and scraps of mammoth leather."
"15453358-2-87";"Hmmm ... you're right. I definitely do that. And I see that there's a note about potential locations for the Mages Guild, which puts this at around 2E 230, so much later than I had hoped!"
"15453358-2-88";"Uncertain? No, although I can understand why you might think so. Falinesti moved with the seasons, traveling to different parts of the Valenwood. From year to year, it took root in the same spot during each season--this map marks its winter site."
"15453358-2-89";"Yes, the Bosmer only barely tolerate my people. Hard to blame them. Travelers don't know the true layout of the area because they stick to the cities for trade and travel. This is detailed enough that it might be from the Wood Elves themselves!"
"15453358-2-90";"More likely the map was created by a cartographer working from older source material--mapmakers often incorporate the work of their predecessors into new maps, correcting and improving it. This parchment is old, but it's not three thousand years old."
"15453358-2-91";"Despite the name, the Reaper's March is more than just a battlefield. It's a melting pot of cultures. Yes, the Khajiit fought bloody wars here, but they also traded with other peoples and prospered in peaceful times."
"15453358-2-93";"Not Imperial, Ugron. I detect a Breton influence on this. It seems overwrought to me--almost florid. A High Rock artist likely designed this as a commemoration of the first sack of Orsinium."
"15453358-2-94";"As you well know, few maps are original works. I'd wager this is a composite of several different maps -- perhaps even Dwemer ones!"
"15453358-2-95";"Odd that it doesn't include Auridon or Artaeum. I guess the cartographer wanted to express Summerset's primacy in the region."
"15453358-2-96";"Black Marsh is virtually impossible to map effectively. Just ask any Imperial cartographer who's tried it. Very few make it back out of that gods-forsaken place alive, and those that do are always disappointed."
"15453358-2-97";"Yes, this clearly depicts the region just after the Thrassian Plague. It's quite odd to see a fully rendered map of the province. Travel in Elsweyr leans heavily upon word of mouth—mostly to keep Baandari caravaners employed."
"15453358-2-98";"I couldn't agree more. The world could use a return to classical penmanship and painting. Alas, I doubt we'll find much high culture in Southern Elsweyr nowadays."
"15453358-2-99";"Maybe they took it from High Lord Torinaan's flag-swan! A lesser-known prophesy foretold that the lost children of Aldmeris would ""make of their branches a new home on distant shores."" The branches bit never made sense. Maybe they meant wooden ships!"
"15453358-2-100";"Could this be a symbol from Aldmeris itself? We High Elves like to pretend we know everything about our place of origin, but what little we do know feels like wild conjecture to me. What if this is what they saw in their sky? A sun unlike any other!"
"15453358-2-101";"I'm not so sure. This sounds like a mourning song. The sting of death was far more acute for my ancient kin since it reminded them of their mortal curse. I reminds me of traditional High Elf requiems."
"15453358-2-111";"Apparently the nautiluses surrounding the island of Agonio are particularly large. Since it was the largest island in the archipelago, maybe it had more abundant resources which allowed them to grow larger than normal."
"15453358-2-112";"I have heard some truly unsettling accounts of the Sload's process of ... maturing. Some anemones have similar reproductive behaviors. I am not suggesting there's a direct connection, but consider it if you must! I'd rather not, personally."
"15453358-2-113";"Take a hard look at the plates. Subtle variations in the color and the pattern of hollows. Different corals probably provided different advantages in battle. Lightness, durability, etc. Best part: it won't sink you to the bottom of the sea."
"15453358-2-114";"Thank you for that vivid description, Amalien. Yes, it may well be a natural waste product. Or perhaps harvested from their young. What little scholarship exists on the subject implies that the Sload do not treat their children well."
"15453358-2-115";"Ha! I've got it! Frog-Metal! Syrabane discovered an alchemical alloy in the mid-First Era to provide armor for early Elven marines. It prevented them from sinking to the bottom if they fell overboard. The Sload would take a keen interest in such a thing!"
"15453358-2-116";"I'm no tailor, but I do have an eye for style. These are cut in such a way that they would be the inner lining of either a hat or possibly even gloves. You can clearly see where the outer layer was pulled away from the stitching."
"15453358-2-117";"I'm sure the Snow Elves made this! They would have certainly found a way to solidify the wood and make use of it. Maybe they even made armor out of it, it's tough enough. And there are marks on this piece that look deep enough to be from a sword!"
"15453358-2-118";"Since this is so flexible, even after all this time, I wonder if it was some kind of wearable display of worship. Something emblazoned on different surfaces, either on armor or someone's shield. They could have even worn it over their regular clothes!"
"15453358-2-119";"Oh! Maybe the Snow Elves figured out a way to make traversing the snow easier. Metal soles that melt the snow while you walk! Or for recreation? How fun would it be to glide along freshly melted tracks of snow?"
"15453358-2-120";"Whatever their origin, they're masterfully smithed. I doubt even a modern Elven clothier could craft something so tiny. It requires a jeweler's focus. This would help create a sturdy object without sacrificing aesthetics. That's the Elven way, after all."
"15453358-2-121";"Perhaps he's unleashing the power of a Wood Elf Wild Hunt! Y'ffre demanded that the Wood Elves keep their shape as part of the Green Pact, but ironically, he allows them to change it again in times of great need. Gods are strange that way."
"15453358-2-122";"I've read stories about a monster created from the Wild Hunt--one that had the body of a serpent and jaws like a shark. It's said to still exist in shallow waters around Valenwood. Maybe it used to be a Wood Elf!"
"15453358-2-123";"Yes! I've heard of Bosmer changing into fearsome waves of blood instead of animals! Wouldn't that be amazing to see? I mean ... horrifying, yes. But still, what a sight!"
"15453358-2-124";"Don't wolves feel a bit too obvious to you? Creatures of the Wild Hunt take on multiple traits--all of them horrifying. This could be a depiction of King Dead Wolf-Deer! He's half-wolf, half-crocodile, or something. And some say he still prowls Valenwood!"
"15453358-2-125";"Can you even imagine seeing a giant tongue chasing after you? It's really too bad that the Wild Hunt leaves no survivors—not even those who willingly take part. I guess we'll have to wait until the Wood Elves feel aggrieved enough to summon up another!"
"15453358-2-126";"But what magic does is possess? These tiny notches in the strand are undoubtedly aligned with Dwemeris script. I believe they stand for knowledge; this strand shapes and binds the magic of the torc with Dwemer lore. Knowledge is the foundation, you see."
"15453358-2-127";"A metallurgist once told me that metals in an alloy are like tones in harmony. An apt metaphor, yes? I doubt the Dwarves recognized any distinction between song and sound, to be honest. Tonal magic and ancient song both lead to wisdom of a sort."
"15453358-2-128";"Be careful with these markings. Even the simplest Dwarven bauble, crafted for diversion and little else, can be lethal if mishandled! When the pieces of the torc are joined together, we'll find out what this device was intended to be."
"15453358-2-129";"Tonal architecture! I've seen the things the Dwarves made with it, of course, but I never imagined I'd actually see a device used by tonal architects in the course of their work. Why, who knows what Dwemer wonders were shaped by this torc?"
"15453358-2-130";"My dear colleague Reginus is, as usual, more right than he lets himself admit. Different crystals naturally conferred different tonal properties. Every piece of this torc was exactingly shaped to focus the specific resonance of this crystal. Perfect!"
"15453358-2-131";"Nonsense! If scholars such as us balked every time a curse was mentioned, we'd never accomplish anything! This upper hoop represents Malacath's blessing of the scourge, by the way. A defense for the wearer."
"15453358-2-132";"What do you know of slights and vengeance, my esteemed colleague? Some Orcs believe the Brutal Breed had the right idea and were saddened when they were wiped out. Not me, mind you, but some among my kind."
"15453358-2-133";"And you're certain this urn contains the ritual oil used to anoint the Brutal Bands? It is believed that every cultist carried the oil to apply to their rings as a sort of prayer or request for perseverance in the face of endless adversity."
"15453358-2-134";"I concur. Moreover, I would go so far as to say this is the core to the head supplicant's band itself! See that symbol? With the slash and the angle? That's a portion of Malacath's true name! I've seen it before, trust me!"
"15453358-2-135";"They would place their Brutal Bands in the dust while they slept, thinking that would charge them with energy from Malacath's domain. I wonder if the Mages Guild could devise a test to determine if the dust actually originated in Oblivion?"
"15453358-2-136";"So, it definitely drinks blood. You can feel it pulse when doing so, and this seems to empower its enchantments. Unless someone volunteers to try it on, that's as much as I can discern. If I wanted a garment to drain the life out of me, I'd buy a corset."
"15453358-2-137";"Amalien's suspicions are correct. I've, unfortunately, had enough experience with evil necromancers to know what Elf leather feels like. This skin isn't technically alive, but it still acts like it. It even seems to heal cuts and abrasions."
"15453358-2-138";"I just cleaned some rust out of that channel, Reginus, and it turned out to be dried blood. Finding it on bits of used armor isn't unusual, but what if it really is a drain? If the owner was a vampire, feeding in battle would be messy business, I think."
"15453358-2-139";"I don't think so, Ugron. There are some powerful magic worked into this metal. Enough so that I question whether the material was chosen for its resilience, or because it takes especially well to enchantment. It's frightening, honestly."
"15453358-2-140";"Maybe it was stitched in place? They seem about the right span for stringing a leather cord through. What about bolts or screws? We are only seeing a small piece of a bigger picture. I'm sure it'll all make sense when put together!"
"15453358-2-141";"You were right! This new figure fits snugly with the Mara, but I never expected her lover to be a Man! Is he meant to be Lorkhan? I don't think I've ever seen evidence of Aldmeri culture being welcomed with such open ... arms."
"15453358-2-142";"So Dorald's hirsute appearance is symbolic, as a stand in for Marukh. I suppose Rislav's unlikely victory over Emperor Gorieus's legions were viewed as divine favor. Did you notice Queen Belene's resemblance to Gabreille in the coronation panel?"
"15453358-2-144";"Then you might find Lost Orsinium and The Pig Children enlightening. You'd be surprised the number of indignities people are willing to suffer. The emphasis on increasing Imperial tithes does support your assertion money was behind this movement."
"15453358-2-145";"I believe the metal objects protruding from this effigy was stabbed into the figure with ritual intent, for cursing, if you will, but I've found no evidence of spellcraft. It might have been used in prayers to Daedra though, or simply just cathartic."
"15453358-2-147";"The inscription appears to be: ""By Arkay's grace we live and die, but there is no end to the Tamrith line."" I'd say they were tempting fate with that credo, but they've made good on their word thus far."
"15453358-2-148";"The archeologist weren't the only ones. These coins are a little on the light side. The difference in gold weight wouldn't have been noticeable without finer instruments than were commonly employed by traders in the middle-First Era."
"15453358-2-150";"Testing on a moist—but firm—cheddar, showed that even this long-dull edge can slice a layer thin enough for light to pass through, suggesting that the flensing rituals of Satakal were more restrained in earlier eras. Self-consumption remains unconfirmed."
"15453358-2-151";"This steel is nearly as strong as orichalcum, but it still wouldn't survive the full force of a blow. If there's truth to the stories of Yokudan's catching swords with their fingers, it wasn't due to the strength of their armor."
"15453358-2-153";"I can confirm that the dirt within the lacquer is from Bangkorai and that the blood soaked into it came from the same person, but I can't identify who that would have been. Unfortunately, this new information could support either theory."
"15453358-2-154";"Another figure, another animal. This one is a wolf woman with six breasts. My theory was that these figures were representations of Hircine, but this latest one casts doubt on that. Perhaps these are totemic Divines, like the Atmorans worshiped?"
"15453358-2-156";"I wouldn't be too quick to rule out Frandar's influence. The Yokudans were advanced enough to have their own navigational devices prior to encountering the observatory. It's entirely possible that Frandar was the first to adopt this design."
"15453358-2-157";"I was skeptical, but I decided to test Amalien's theory and sure enough the wheel fit over the end of a broken steam pipe. It's a bit unstable, but the moving parts whir around at a surprising speed. This mechanism could easily power a number of tools."
"15453358-2-159";"Whale-bridle, from the clan's seafaring days. Their stories claim their ancestors tamed killer whales in the Abecean Sea and trained them for war. Riders could harpoon ships and steer them using the whales' strength. Evidence of a long-lost tradition."
"15453358-2-160";"Third time's a charm! And a pattern! The Ayleids here must have considered Hermaeus Mora their patron. If they held knowledge in such high regard, some of these ruins may have been part of a college. I can practically hear the library calling! Can you?"
"15453358-2-162";"Yes, brutal indeed. These faded symbols on the sides are marks of the Rontha, the largest of the tribes to invade Stonefalls. Uniquely vicious, they branded items or people captured from battle. I suspect they were not this skin's original crafters."
"15453358-2-163";"Yes, perhaps a blast from this announced Vrage the Butcher himself. We know he enjoyed traveling to survey his conquered territory. I gave the horn a small toot and it has quite a nice tone. Sounded regal, and not terrifying as I imagined."
"15453358-2-165";"Fine eye, Amalien! An Ashlander work with this snake design points to one answer: the Mabrigash tribe. Amazing that they already occupied Deshaan so soon after the split. Perhaps they believed lit candle fixtures would placate their angry Ghost Snake."
"15453358-2-166";"Daedric meanings often shift over time. Given the context, these words hew closer to ""return,"" ""deflate,"" and ""dry out"". Could be references to the Thrassian Plague? We know it reached this far east, so I'd guess tribes used the mask to heal victims."
"15453358-2-168";"Magical analysis dates the doll to sometime in the Merethic. I exposed the doll to a vial of Hist sap and the leaves grew iridescent. Perhaps if we had a Circle member more knowledgeable in Argonian history, they could help explain these mysteries."
"15453358-2-169";"Analysis shows that the medallion is extremely old—early Merethic era or even perhaps before. But that makes no sense so perhaps my ritual was faulty. Also, despite appearances this isn't silver. It's some other metal I haven't seen before. Strange."
"15453358-2-171";"Casting-bones are passed from teacher to student down through the generations; they get their power from the skill and renown of their previous owners. Each new augur adds a bone and its rune to the collection--and this is a large set indeed."
"15453358-2-172";"Ah, the origin of the Dragonguard. The Akaviri recognized Reman I as the Dragonborn and swore allegiance to him. This lord may have been one of the last Akaviri to raise swords against the future Emperor—or one of the first to bend the knee to him."
"15453358-2-174";"This belonged to a fighter, not a priest. The ash-leaves are also emblems of Shor's hall that lies in a distant grove of Sovngarde, guarded by god-touched heroes; the bearer of this shield meant to find death in battle and join their ranks."
"15453358-2-175";"Warlike? No, cursed! The connection is clear: the brooch is the emblem of a family whose lords are werewolves. The Jurgalds ruled Lower Yorgrim for centuries, and they embraced Hircine's curse. Could this be the cloak-clasp of a Jurgald thane?"
"15453358-2-177";"Nord captains of the time often took their steering oar from ship to ship. A carved oar was the emblem of an experienced navigator, something that showed other Nord warriors that they could trust the captain's ability to find a way across the seas."
"15453358-2-178";"As Verita notes, this is a Dragon Faithful's war-mask. I'm no carpenter, but the way it's been hewn right down the center might indicate a sword stroke. Perhaps this fellow met his end under the blade of a rebelling Nord."
"15453358-2-180";"Each side has an extra token because this set is a variation known as Traitor's Dematah. A very popular variant among Dunmer nobles in the middle of the First Era. You could replace an opponent's ""slave"" with one of your own—""turning a traitor,"" you see?"
"15453358-2-181";"House Dres, I believe. They have been at the forefront of the Dunmeri slave trade since the middle of the First Era; here is the House Dres linked-chain symbol. And these slave figures appear to be laboring in a saltrice field. 1E, 26th century."
"15453358-2-183";"I have to disagree, Amalien. The ship portrayed on one side exhibits a later art style, as does the lettering on the other. I'd say more like early 2E given the lettering style alone. I know that disappoints you, but I do know my engraving history."
"15453358-2-184";"Don't be dense! Look at the contours of the face, and this salt-glazing technique! You're just being contrary. The residue inside looks green and flaky--perhaps the ashy remains of some seaweed they find particularly aromatic. I bet it smelled terrible!"
"15453358-2-186";"Sounding a horn to commence a hunt? I doubt it. The last thing a Wood Elf would do is announce the beginning of a hunt to the whole forest. Nor do the Bosmer use the Wild Hunt for mere decoration. No, this horn is blown to signal the end of the hunt."
"15453358-2-187";"Many Ayleid clans fled to the Valenwood in the aftermath of the Alessian Rebellion. I believe this to be a Bawn or Anutwyll heirloom carried away from one of those fallen strongholds around 1E 243. That means it could date back to the Merethic Era!"
"15453358-2-189";"There's a theory that Ayleid culture died out in this area because they became unable to reproduce with one another, and mated with the local Bosmer instead. I wonder if this was a gradual shift that was met with resistance?"
"15453358-2-190";"It's said the spirits of Ouze were restless ... maybe that means they haunted the surrounding area? These could have been talismans the locals wore to ward off ghosts! Or to keep the spirits from crawling back out of those creepy tar-pits."
"15453358-2-192";"You're close, Amalien. It's the femur of a terror bird, more commonly found in the plains east of the Valenwood. I recognize the story: It's the account of a bold chief's raid against the khajiit of Anequina, 6th century 1E."
"15453358-2-193";"Perhaps, but some Ayleid ruins in these lands predate the collapse of their empire. This storm-cloud emblem, here, belongs to the lords of Ilayas, a stronghold founded centuries  before the empire's decline. This scabbard has been here a long time!"
"15453358-2-195";"I believe this censer hung in the temple at Rawl'kha--the very place where Rid-Thar-ri'Datta revealed his epiphany. You can tell by the alignment of Jone and Jode in the scrollwork. Could it have been hanging in the sacred hall at that very hour?"
"15453358-2-196";"Hunt-lords were skilled hunters, but the nomadic tribes saw war as a hunt, too. A great hunt-lord was a warrior of high renown as well as a provider for the people--leader of a fierce army and master of wide lands. A king, in other words."
"15453358-2-198";"Upon closer inspection, I wonder if these were made ironically. Khenarthi is said to carry the souls to the Sands Behind the Stars. Perhaps she's carrying the soul of someone who indulged a bit too much."
"15453358-2-199";"There are stories of a famous fisherman around this time named Fazjum. In one of them, he caught a Desert Sucker the size of a horse that was terrorizing the waters. He was said to have a fishing rod exactly like this!"
"15453358-2-204";"Oh, you're right! How did I not see that? It's so obvious when you look closely. That mechanism is incredibly sophisticated.  In that case, perhaps it belonged to a Xivilai torturer. How exciting!"
"15453358-2-205";"While I agree these are from Coldharbour itself, I'm hesitant to jump to conclusions based on mere residue. The Lightless Oubliette was a detention facility for servants of Meridia. Manacles seem too kind a punishment for what goes on in that place."
"15453358-2-207";"Meddle? I suppose. Based on my research, a sect of Nedic mages called the Eternal Watchers, used their souls as a means to lock away a lich called Virmaril the Betrayer. This could belong to one of them."
"15453358-2-208";"Yes, many Nedes wisely kept their reverence for the Serpent constellation at arm's length. Recent events in Craglorn make the dangers of flirting with such a powerful entity abundantly clear."
"15453358-2-213";"Looks like a little Diagna to me. Redguard sword-god. Apparently, fighters from the Order of Diagna kept totems like this for luck during the siege of Orsinium. It probably fell from the purse of a Redguard warrior as an Orcish warrior struck them down."
"15453358-2-214";"More likely, it's from the Barzanakh clan. According to the stronghold tales, the entire Barzanakh clan ate out of a single bowl. The tradition supposedly ensured that everyone took their share, and no more. Always assumed that was metaphorical. Fascinating."
"15453358-2-216";"Music rarely offers a true account, but one Redguard folksong describes several bizarre costuming fads that took hold in Prince Hubalajad's court. Fake beards, not wigs, were briefly in fashion. Sadly, tailors often died trying to procure the materials."
"15453358-2-217";"The hinterlands of Hew's Bane crawled with Maomer slavers in the latter years of the First Era. According to local legends, one group used ""snake magic"" and ensorcelled locks when capturing slaves to ensure that they remained docile and compliant."
"15453358-2-219";"Not clasped, Verita. The hands seem to be struggling over the same object--trying to steal it from one another. Is it the Amulet of Kings? Might this imply some discontent about Imperial governance? Or even stand as a call to rebellion?"
"15453358-2-220";"We don't have nearly enough evidence to be able to associate this disembodied head with the Mermaid of Anvil. I'll grant you, the stone appears similar in composition, but the face looks like statues of regent council lords in nearby Kvatch to me."
"15453358-2-222";"Chimer fell into a real rut in the latter days of the Merethic. You don't often see Chimer-modified tools like this, but my best guess is that some opportunistic herder repurposed the rod's shaft as a simple nix-prod. Probably blasphemous, but effective."
"15453358-2-223";"Dark Elves do have a long (and disturbing) tradition of bizarre animal husbandry. My question would be, where's the evidence of similar creatures? Ald'ruhn proves the crabs' remains last a long time. I've never seen any remains that approach that size."
"15453358-2-225";"Just so, Gabrielle! Sotha Sil borrowed all manner of ideas from the dwarves. This vessel is his answer to the Dwemeric dynamo core. If you conducted a test on that residue, I think you'll find it shares many of the same properties as soul gems!"
"15453358-2-226";"I can't. No matter who they worship now, the Dark Elves are still children of the Velothi tradition. Then again, if a living god tells you to abandon a belief, who would refuse? Present day apostles probably can't even remember the Good Daedra's names."
"15453358-2-228";"It was a calian--one of the precious spheres we High Elves receive as youths. If we commit a grave offense, an ascendent curate smashes it and demands we repair it. Seems an apraxic mer chose to make a decanter of it instead. It's ... disheartening."
"15453358-2-229";"I beg your pardon, Amalien, but I don't think this belonged to a jurisreeve. At least not a jurisreeve as we currently understand the term. This looks like a religious talisman of some kind. Perhaps the jurisreeve tradition began as a religious order?"
"15453358-2-231";"Pretty remarkable that it's lasted this long! I believe it's the work of the Dead-Water tribe. No tribe in Black Marsh comes close when it comes to carcass dressing and taxidermy."
"15453358-2-232";"Yes, Argonians abandoned stonework millennia ago, making this stake a true oddity. Apparently, ancient and modern Argonians exercised similar burial traditions. It's really too bad that the Argonians will react to this insight with a collective shrug."
"15453358-2-234";"Could this be a famed killing claw of Vashrjo the Killer? He was a famed Pellitine assassin that was rumored to have killed high ranking officials in Anequina. Apparently he'd leave a fake claw by the body so they knew who committed the deed."
"15453358-2-235";"In the earliest days of the Thrassian Plague, Khajiit healers started with simple masks like these to prevent the spread of infection. It quickly became evident that they were not sufficient, however, so they were abandoned and never iterated on."
"15453358-2-237";"I defer to Ugron on matters military, of course. It's the cultural motifs I find most interesting! The Dragonguard were the children of two worlds: Imperial and Akaviri. This bolt reflects those merging aesthetics."
"15453358-2-238";"No soldier would strap this to their arm like a tower shield. More likely, they planted it in the ground like a pavise. Meteoric-Iron is resistant to most elements, so if you wanted to avoid getting burnt to a crisp fighting Dragons, this would help."
"15453358-2-240";"You're half-right, Ugron. The bared weapons in the design tell us that this pendant depicts a scene of conflict. But no self-respecting Nord warrior would seek magical advantage in battle. No, this image commemorates an old warrior's victories."
"15453358-2-241";"Could this horn have belonged to Jarl Vundarr Openhand of Hjaalmarch? The skalds of his day composed songs about his wealth and generosity. He was said to have been buried with a king's ransom in barrow-treasure."
"15453358-2-243";"Of course! A group as powerful and secretive as the Psijic Order wouldn't just set ink to parchment like some common mage. I only wonder how they managed to make these markings. A magic plume, or do they simply will the glyphs into being?"
"15453358-2-244";"You may be right, Ugron. The tip of the wand seems darker and more gnarled than the rest. I suspect the Order's scryers tap the surface of their basins with this ensorcelled tool to get a better view of the world, and perhaps even the future!"
"15453358-2-246";"I read about some mage from High Rock who tried to transport grummites to Tamriel so he could harvest them for pearls. Locals razed his tower to the ground, with him inside. Good thing too. Can you imagine creatures like that making it into our waterways?"
"15453358-2-247";"You and your fancies. This is made of bone. From a sea animal. And the age places it in the First Era, when the Altmer ruled the island. It's a chance cube, used in the ancient Altmer practice of creating stories in a group. Harmless, but entertaining."
"15453358-2-249";"Orcs of the First Era knew orichalc better than Argonians know mud. If they used larger tools, they definitely had a reason. In any event, I wager an anvil this big found more use in siegecraft fabrication than armorsmithing."
"15453358-2-250";"Molag Bal practices all sorts of bizarre alchemy in his Vile Laboratory. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to pry some facet of Mephala's realm into his own. Corrupting the essence of another Prince would be difficult, but not impossible."
"15453358-2-251";"I can explain that easily enough. This seat didn't come from Elden Root. It came from Falinesti--the walking city, and true home of the Wood Elves! Trust me on this one. Once you run your hand over the wide grain of Falinesti, you never forget it."
"15453358-2-252";"Yeah, I'm no naturalist, but those teeth look closer to swamp leviathan fangs than sabre cat cuspids. We might have proof of an Oddoak—ugly shape-shifting beasts that Y'ffre charged the Wood Elves with slaying back in the Merethic. Good find."
"15453358-2-253";"Orcs dress bones better. Eh. Debate for another time. Apparently, Kjervilde killed each of her subjects with a single arrow to the heart. Can't say as I've ever heard of an arrow that can fell a mammoth all at once, but few things surprise me anymore."
"15453358-2-254";"Cultural exchange with the Kothringi, maybe? But that would set the origins of Kothringi culture farther back than we thought. As for the egg, it's metaphorical. Eggs represent beginnings. So, a depiction of Sithis consuming some origin? Tough to say."
"15453358-2-255";"Yeah, I've read about them. I even traveled to Alinor to investigate. I'm sorry, Amalien, but I didn't find any proof of a successful journey to Aetherius. It makes sense for the Aldmer to have tried, but we need more proof than a beautiful glass feather."
"15453358-2-256";"It's definitely Ayleid-make, but I doubt they meant for it to look like this. Something corrupted its Aetherial resonance. This band ... it almost feels diagnostic in design. Perhaps this was their attempt to understand the red crystal. To fix it even?"
"15453358-2-257";"The graht-oak of Silvenar produces objects like this from time to time, but only at the urging of the Silvenar himself. Someone well-attuned to the Green could probably coax some Y'ffrine miracle out of it, but that's well outside our capabilities!"
"15453358-2-258";"Makes sense that Ayleid sorcerer kings would wield weapons capable of bending their subjects' minds—especially during the civilization's latter days when their appetites turned dark as coal. No race, no matter how depraved, will stand for that forever."
"15453358-2-259";"I think the magicka stored in this fragment is largely spent at this point. Removing it from the crash-site might have diminished its connection to the obelisk, resulting in a slow degradation of its potency. It's inert, yes, but still beautiful!"
"15453358-2-260";"Sort of begs the question: why did a Yokudan warrior who could call a magical sword to hand at will need a scabbard? I guess this could have been purely ornamental. Or maybe having a physical anchor made summoning the weapon easier."
"15453358-2-261";"Nerevar and Dumac's warm relationship likely led to some cultural exchange. Dwemer society was too intransigent to absorb traditions from other cultures, but even the most pious Chimer probably wanted a break from stone and chitin-carving at some point."
"15453358-2-262";"I've seen the paintings you're referring to Ugron. I agree, the patterning is similar. But this tree-shaped relief gives me pause. I wonder if this contained a bribe for nobles who helped Merchant-Lord Etien Lenac claim the throne of Wayrest in 1E 1270."
"15453358-2-263";"No need to apologize, Gabrielle. Orcs worship Malacath. My people's connections with Daedric ritual ran twice as deep when they stretched this drum. The runes are Malacath devotionals. Grudge-marks. When the warcaller beat this drum, battle was certain."
"15453358-2-264";"Auri-El, by the looks of it. Seems a little abstract, honestly. Elves make a point of including Elven likenesses in their shrines to reinforce their familial connections to the Divines. This probably rested near a statue of the Chief Divine himself."
"15453358-2-265";"It pains me to admit that I don't recognize this school of painting. It's so vague, yet evocative. Proud spires, floating obelisks, wispy, concentric clouds .... The artist really made an effort to capture Elven majesty there."
"15453358-2-266";"Exactly right! I have it on good authority that Sotha Sil (one of the Dark Elf gods) keeps his memories stored away in a great orrery full of stars. Another name for manufactured memory stones, I suppose. Who knows what memories this contains!"
"15453358-2-267";"Really makes you wonder--what threat did Dagoth pose to the Tribunal? I try to avoid Dark Elf politics, personally, but to wipe all mention of the Sixth House from the record seems excessive to the point of suspicious."
"15453358-2-268";"Speaking of skin, I wish this bust included color! Dark Elf portraiture leans toward monochromatic, abstract compositions. I'm desperate to know if they conceptualize Nerevar with gold or ashen skin. I bet it's gray. Dark Elves are master revisionists."
"15453358-2-269";"Possibly. It doesn't explain the larger pools, though. Maybe the Twilight Cantors played a role? Priestesses of that order often sing at religious ceremonies and enjoy a rich bathing culture. I can definitely see one of them anointing ja'khajiit in this."
"15453358-2-270";"I assume you haven't visited Black Marsh recently. The Nothing-Speaker tradition is still very much alive in the southern and central regions of the province. I've even met one. He seemed cheerful enough ... but I wouldn't put blood rituals past him."
"15453358-2-271";"We Bretons are a stubborn lot, it's true. I did some digging, and it looks like those seals on the side derive from House Moorcroft heraldry. This knight might have died in the Gavaudon Troubles, just before the flight from Wayrest. Fascinating!"
"15453358-2-272";"One of Ysgramor's heirs, no doubt! We identify Harald as the thirteenth in Ysgramor's line, but his forebears likely adorned their weapons, armor, even their silverware with Ysgramor's image. His face would lend legitimacy to any official act."
"15453358-2-273";"Stalhrim is undeniably mortal-made. Focus on the brazier. I don't recognize any of these markings as burial motifs, but stalhrim was traditionally used in funerary rituals. I know Nords abhor spellcraft, but this looks like an arcane focus to me."
"15453358-2-274";"Honestly, Ugron. Satakal is not a sinister deity. It's the personification of a timeless theme. What I find most astounding is the scale. Many Tamrielic religions profess belief in reincarnation. But reincarnation of Mundus itself? That's truly something."
"15453358-2-275";"There's a far more plausible--albeit less palatable--explanation for this. I've found several bronzed beetles in Dunmeri ancestral tombs. This beast likely suffered a similar fate. We can only hope it wasn't still breathing when they sealed it in metal."
"15453358-2-276";"You give the Ayleids too much credit, Reginus. The Heartland Elves turned to Daedra-worship long before Ayleid ironsmiths crafted this chandelier. If anything, it should feature sixteen stones to honor their cursed Daedric pantheon!"
"15453358-2-277";"Obviously, the bust is symbolic. But that does nothing to prove Morihaus looked like you, Reginus! Surely, the existence of minotaurs is proof enough that chimeric creatures exist. A demigod exhibiting those traits is well within the realm of possibility!"
"15453358-2-278";"Sure, keeping the scrolls clean makes sense. But have you considered the possibility that they were scrubbing off something from the scrolls? Some aetherial residue that could deaden their fingers like the scrolls deaden the eyes? Think about it!"
"15453358-2-279";"Mara's mercy, Reginus! For once in your life, can you just appreciate the majesty of what our friend uncovered? Obviously, the sculptor did not have the benefit of firsthand knowledge, but this is the truest depiction of Alessia we've ever seen!"
"15453358-2-280";"By ""Tamrielic norms,"" I assume you mean worship of the Eight Divines? You might consider Orc and Argonian religious practice before swinging the word ""norm"" around. Anyway, it's a remarkable altar—especially considering it's all in one piece."
"15453358-2-281";"Well, it's not a simple lamp to read by, I can tell you that! It seems like a beacon of some kind—something to be seen at a great distance. The Direnni might have used it as a geographic marker to gauge the distance of objects from the Adamantine Tower!"
"15453358-2-282";"The inscription reads, Infernace. A command word, perhaps? Or simply the name of the realm it led to? With the appropriate ritual, an ancient Chimer might have been able to coax an atronach out of this thing. Fascinating."
"15453358-2-283";"The hue seems too dark for meteoric glass. This metallic banding is curious too. It's almost like they were trying to keep something contained in the sphere. Seers might have used it as a scrying stone. It follows, given the Magrus connection. Curious."
"15453358-2-284";"Am I the only one who noticed the third moon in the background? Enduring magical images are all well and good, but a genuine artistic expression of the Dark Moon? That makes me think this mirror might be a little more sinister than it looks."
"15453358-2-285";"I guess that's plausible if we're just speaking metaphorically. I've tried to turn myself into a horse more than once and never met with much success. For a mage--even an immortal one--to turn himself into a gigantic sea monster? That's a stretch."
"15453358-2-286";"It may be hard to believe, but this is what passes for art in Coldharbour. Some people insist that lesser Daedra are incapable of creative expression and appreciation for art, but I can definitely imagine a Dremora Kynreeve staring at this for hours."
"15453358-2-287";"Amalien, these rumors of flying whales are patently absurd. Nord warriors ""cross the whalebone bridge"" to reach Sovngarde. Flying whales are just a cultural metaphor for the transition from Nirn to Aetherius. In any case, they look like waves to me."
"15453358-2-288";"Makes sense. Bruk'ra wander-kings all but annexed the city after Darloc Brae's conquests. It's possible that the Imperials finished construction on the Chapel of Zenithar by then. But if the Khajiit did convert it, Imperial histories would never admit it."
"15453358-2-289";"If there's a difference between Nibenese and Colovians, you would barely notice. In any case, I'd date this back to 1E 1900's. Some Daedra-worshiper probably took it to the coast to escape the Alessian Order's inquisitors. Guess it didn't work out."
"15453358-2-290";"No great surprise there. The Saliache were a proud and possessive people. Reign rarely passed to heirs without some kind of arcane intrigue. Perhaps this king suffered a devious, over-ambitious son and sealed the crown onto his head as a final insult."
"15453358-2-291";"It's certainly a lightwell, but our focus should be the crystal. The magicka it's radiating feels less manufactured than a welkynd stone. This is a raw Aetherial Fragment. Untamed. The way it resonates with the iron … let's not jostle it too hard."
"15453358-2-292";"But why a Dragon skull? Prior to the Dragon War, those brutes had little cause to contemplate their own mortality. Unless ... a Dragon itself suffered the sacrifice? Maybe Dragon Priests gathered to watch Alduin administer such a rite. A ghastly thought!"
"15453358-2-293";"A coffer? Come on! The Dwarves would never use a device like this for something so prosaic! This is a testing device--a puzzle. And judging by the number of pinions, cylinders, and junction-points, I'd say it's a test none of us are likely to pass."
"15453358-2-294";"You know, Atmorans did learn a few things from the Elves prior to the fall of Saarthal. Honestly, I'm surprised we don't find more cultural crossover in art from that period. Ysgramor's heirs must have gone to great lengths to destroy items like this."
"15453358-2-295";"Boethra--the Khajiiti variant of Daedric Prince, Boethiah? The presence of a katana, the cloak, and the imperious expression all fit. Ancient Khajiit honored her as a patron of warriors and rebellious exiles. That feline companion's a puzzler, though!"
"15453358-2-296";"It's not odd at all! Choice plays a central role in the process of death and rebirth for both Nords and Khajiit. Both have to earn their way to paradise. Kyne and Khenarthi reward courage and faithfulness respectively. A personal escort makes sense."
"15453358-2-297";"I find this work puzzling. The Alessians placed severe restrictions on artists prior to their decline which grew into cultural taboos. Imperial painters didn't resume painting the Imperial City in its entirety until the final years of the First Era. Odd."
"15453358-2-298";"Truth is, we know next to nothing about the Snow Elves' governmental structure, because Ysgramor and his companions wiped the slate clean during their invasion. The Atmorans weren't all that clever, but they were certainly thorough."
"15453358-2-299";"No need to remind me. From what I hear, ivory restitution was one of Kurog's demands when Emeric invited him to join the Daggerfall Covenant. We took tusks as part of our Ranser's War spoils, too. We Orcs always get what we're owed ... eventually."
"15453358-2-300";"That's because all six rulers were the same person! I've found a wealth of documents that describe the rulers' appearance and manner as identical. ""The line of Frestrien bore stern features that appeared wrought from pale marble …."" He was a vampire!"
"15453358-2-301";"The lack of stars on the relic itself doesn't necessarily mean it didn't feature stars in another way. The oil reservoir has a layer of crystalline build-up--some kind of meteoric fuel, I bet. The light this lamp shed probably resembled starlight!"
"15453358-2-302";"Look at the stone. This Morwha's rendered in gypsum alabaster--a favored material of the Yokudans' hated enemies, the Sinistral Mer. The sculptor probably acquired the stone during the early days of the Ra Gada, thus explaining the lack of orichalc."
"15453358-2-303";"I'm not so sure, Ugron. I've seen etchings like this in Wood Elf wild patches and sapling-chapels. I think they refer to growth and abundance. They may have filled it with soil and summoned Green Pact relics out of it."
"15453358-2-304";"Frost magic can do a lot of good during a siege. Freeze the enemy, glaze the gates and parapets, etc. Even so, I'd hate to see one of these deployed in the field. The last thing Cyrodiil needs right now is an arms race."
"15453358-2-305";"I'm no metallurgist, but this metal could likely endure tremendous heat; so I agree with Amalien on that. To Ugron's point, yes, I strongly suspect this is a weapon of war. Something used to rain fire down upon one's enemies."
"15453358-2-306";"If it's shock value we're going for here (and no, I won't apologize for that) I'd like to throw in the possibility of this being a component of a security system. The Dwarves were extremely talented at keeping people out of places."
"15453358-2-307";"Aetherbells? You mean Dwarven vessels that ""dive"" through the realms of Aetherius and Oblivion? Honestly, Amalien, do you have even a shred of evidence to support the idea that those even exist? These are clearly constellation markers. Nothing more."
"15453358-2-308";"Seems pretty hubristic for the Nedes, don't you think? In any event, I don't detect any significant magical potency here. If they were trying to channel aetherial energy through this altar, it's all but faded now. Still a beautiful piece, though!"
"15453358-2-312";"I'd be curious to see a map of this area from the First Era, if such a thing could ever be found. All that remains of the great Ayleid settlements is broken marble and subterranean dangers. A fitting end for such a terrible people."
"15453358-2-313";"Yes. Nedes, Orcs, Yokudans, Ayleids, Dwarves ... the list goes on and on! It's almost comforting to know that despite its tumultuous history, the land itself remains largely unchanged."
"15453358-2-314";"I can't imagine this map will stay accurate for long. Correct me if I'm wrong, Gabrielle, but I believe Daedric realms change as often as their ruling Prince's mood. Who knows what Coldharbour will look like in centuries to come."
"15453358-2-315";"You make it sound so glorious, Reginus! The truth is that Price Hew was a irresponsible clod. This map doesn't tell the full tale of his blundering."
"15453358-2-335";"You're exactly right, Ugron. I've seen a ring like this in Alard Dorell's private collection. It belonged to a Knight of the Pale Order! Defunct now, but rightly feared during the latter years of the Direnni's flight from High Rock."
"15453358-2-336";"We shouldn't rule out the possibility they were vampires, Gabrielle! I found eye-witness accounts of Pale Order Knights awash in blood who somehow grew stronger as battles wore on. Even if they weren't vampires, I'd wager some dark magic was at play!"
"15453358-2-337";"This belonged to a Knight of the Pale Order? Y'ffre's bones! Just whispering their name on Balfiera Island can get you cast off the Adamantine Tower headfirst. Legends say they butchered Elves by the cartload and never grew tired. Spooky stuff!"
"15453358-2-338";"Quite right, Amalien. But the Knights of the Pale Order didn't just count their victories against Direnni foes. They notched their shields and scabbards for any unassisted triumph. Elves, trolls, Orcs, Goblins … anything they killed in single combat."
"15453358-2-339";"I doubt the Knights of the Pale Order spent much time with the palace elite — or even with each other! According to these genealogical records, none of them ever married. Seems they kept their own counsel and preferred to travel, dine, and fight alone."
"15453358-2-340";"It's certainly lovely on its own, but take a closer look. See the intermittent tarnishing? I'd say someone strung beads or pearls on this. Perhaps both. If what Amalien said about Syrabane's influence is true, some magic pearls might not be far off."
"15453358-2-341";"I don't dispute the arcane potential of pearls. Unlike most stones, they have living origins. This makes them unique in the world of enchantment. Even so, to claim they share some special connection with basic physical laws seems a bit far-fetched."
"15453358-2-342";"I can attest to that Elven obsession with pearls--but not just in healing. Fandamorien's ""Treatise on Vigor"" spends a whole chapter detailing the augmentative power of pearls on both mages and athletes. Maybe the Ehlnofey really do favor these things."
"15453358-2-343";"Aldmer wizards like Maelor the Twin and Surillion Ocean-King wore necklaces of power that incorporated all kinds of watery stones and pearls. They had names, just like the mages who wore them. But they were collectively known as Pearls of the Ehlnofey."
"15453358-2-344";"Judging by the arcane energies they're emitting, I think these beads might predate the High Elves, Amalien. Based on the holes and the uniformity of the shapes, I wager these belonged to a magic necklace. Far more powerful than their modern successors."
"15453358-2-353";"A monster in more ways than one. Faolan, the Reach warrior known as Red Eagle, may have been the first briarheart. The black mark on the chest of the figure in this painting represents Red Eagle's transformation at the hands of the Hagravens."
"15453358-2-354";"I recently read an account of Reach folklore describing a force called the ""Night Lords,"" and how they thirsted for Reach children's blood. I wonder if this could be a remnant of the villains of that story."
"15453358-2-355";"It looks like both Red Eagle Redoubt and Markarth are accounted for, but rendered by a dismissive hand. I think Ugron is right. I'd place this map around Empress Hestra's reign, and definitely long after the disapperance of the Dwemer."
"15453358-2-356";"There are old Imperial reports of Reachfolk using such tactics to lead their enemies. They knew their land incredibly well and could often confuse adversaries with fake trail markings to get them into better position. Maybe this is what they used."
"15453358-2-357";"Oh! Considering where it was found and how specific the apparatus seems to be, my guess is that it was used to extract aetherium! Raldbthar Dwarves would probably have experimented with devices like this before moving on to heavier machinery."
"15453358-2-359";"The question remains, just how old is this map? Based on the age of the vellum, I'd date it at 1E 400s. That might explain the conspicuous absence of Whiterun. The cartographer sought to write the hated king, Olaf One-Eye, out of the history books!"
"15453358-2-375";"Z'en is not an inherently vengeful deity. ""Payment in kind"" can mean equitable trade, basic fairness, and so on. By all accounts, the Kothringi were decent folk who placed great emphasis on forthrightness. Perhaps reverence for Z'en played a role."
"15453358-2-376";"Never underestimate a Kothringi's skill in a boat! They probably used this along the coast--never venturing too far out into the Topal Bay. It's sturdy enough to cross the Niben, and small enough to navigate the swamp. A perfect vessel for Blackwood."
"15453358-2-377";"That may explain why the spade itself is so well-preserved. Bogs are notorious for degrading things lost to their depths at a much slower rate than other environments. Perhaps this was lost below the surface for all these years."
"15453358-2-378";"Yes! The Aedra angle is an interesting one, too. The Barsaebic Ayleids left to avoid their Daedra-worshiping kin during the Narfinsel Schism. It makes sense given the location!"
"15453358-2-380";"Regius is right about this map, the focus on waterways shows a sailor's eye. See how the Snake Tail River opens into marshlands instead of carrying on to the Niben itself? That might date the map between the flood of 2E 218 and the Crow's Storm of 2E 255."
"15453358-2-381";"The shape is a curiosity. Uneven, for certain, but I noticed one side is smooth. This could be for any number of reasons, but I think the most reasonable is that it was fixed against something once. A necklace, maybe? A ring?"
"15453358-2-382";"Is it just me, or does holding this inspire a sense of reckless indulgence? Like, gazing at it, I feel like I could do anything! I don't really sense anything magical about the piece itself, but it's been touched by a powerful being. Possibly Daedric!"
"15453358-2-383";"I agree it looks rather forbidding, but I wonder if this might have looked less threatening and more luxurious with the jewels intact.  I defer to Amalien on Daedric anything, but I'd also consider looking at a less malevolent origin."
"15453358-2-384";"Perhaps it was made for combat? Or some other kind of rigorous activity? It seems Daedric in origin, and I can think of at least one Daedric Prince who never gives his followers a moment's rest: Sanguine."
"15453358-2-385";"There are accounts of the Daedric Prince Sanguine giving mortals these kinds of rings when they attended his parties. Some say they would tighten unexpectedly to keep those who were bound to party from giving in to exhaustion. Definitely don't put it on!"
"15453358-2-386";"Ooh, maybe it's part of a necromancer's talisman! We should try it on a pile of bones and see if anything happens!"
"15453358-2-387";"Vampires are not my area of expertise, but I can tell you this thing stinks of Alteration magic. If it does involve vampires, it could have something to do with their ability to transform into bats."
"15453358-2-388";"I agree about Hircine, but I think this symbol is even more telling. The angle and style of the symbol is commonly found outside of ruins where those afflicted by Lycanthropy used to congregate. It was both a warning and an invitation."
"15453358-2-389";"I wouldn't discount the magical components of this piece. There's a good deal of latent Alteration magic present in this component, and this is only part of a whole. Whoever wore this likely did not need any help intimidating others."
"15453358-2-390";"Mages are still quite fond of this kind of clasp for many of their more powerful adornments. Amulets of power, charmed wristbands and the like all tend to feature this kind of clasp to ensure your enchanted silver doesn't get lost in a dungeon."
"15453358-2-391";"The Kothringi's distaste for clothing is well-known, but someone definitely wore this. Perhaps as a robe or kilt? It carries arcane power, for sure. Something primal--helping the wearer find success on a hunt, I'll bet."
"15453358-2-392";"A powerful fetish indeed! According to Kothringi folklore, bog-blue jaspers come from the gizzards of ""geels-ha butcher eels""--massive river predators that swallow haj mota whole! This stone holds tremendous cultural--and maybe magical--power."
"15453358-2-393";"Let's not overstate, Amalien. The Kothringi were well aware of gold's value outside Black Marsh. But, it is true that musicality played an oversized role in their cultural expression. Judging by the size, they probably wore these around the waist."
"15453358-2-394";"Whatever its origin, this tail is heavily enchanted. Kothringi magic is so unusual that I almost missed it. It heightens the wearer's senses, I think. Or their reflexes. Perhaps both? At any rate, it's only one part of a larger garment. Still, remarkable!"
"15453358-2-395";"I believe Reginus has the right of it. Wealthy Kothringi sailors probably used this in their boats or even wore it around the waist. The coloration here indicates to me that something was strung on it. Glass beads or talismans. Both functional and lovely."
"15453358-2-396";"I wouldn't dismiss Ugron's concerns out of hand, Verita. I detect deep reservoirs of chaotic energy in the glass. It means to make some sort of trade, I think. Not uncommon in enchanted Argonian relics, but still unsettling."
"15453358-2-397";"I saw a bas relief in a xanmeer near Soulrest that depicted a bird like that--devouring an egg framed by the sun. I figured it was an illustration of Argonian reincarnation, but now I'm thinking these birds might have some cultural connection to Sithis."
"15453358-2-398";"We often consider Helstrom the immortal capital of the Argonian people, but I've found evidence of a struggle for regional hegemony in Soulrest. Greater coastal access in Soulrest allowed for more imports of foreign goods and aesthetics."
"15453358-2-399";"I gave up trying to identify Argonian varnishes some years ago, but these teeth are very well preserved--too well preserved to be a simple tool. I suspect they featured in some ceremonial dress. Perhaps to channel the shark's resilience? Or appetite?"
"15453358-2-400";"You're right, Ugron. This pattern—reminiscent of a Khajiiti cross weave—most often appears in Argonian martial gear. Tsojei grip wraps, armor and shield straps, etc. A wealthy warrior probably used this with a helmet of some kind!"
"15453358-2-430";"Yeah, a Kynval or Kynreeve definitely used this to direct their unit and administer punishment. But that's not all. See the notches here? The Dremora cracked this over the back of other wayward soldiers too. Ruinachs and Daedroths, maybe? Bold move!"
"15453358-2-431";"The lack of information on Mindcleavers is no accident. Dagon's current favorites, the Ruinbloods, purged all evidence of their existence. I found a Firescourge scroll that described them as a hated secret police, deposed by an alliance of smaller clans!"
"15453358-2-434";"I doubt this is intended for Daedra. The width of the gibbet limbs implies a variety of scale--from the broadest Orc to the scrawniest Wood Elf. By Mauloch, you could probably fit a Pahmar in there if you really worked at it. Gruesome."
"15453358-2-435";"Gabrielle is right! I know a reputable Daedrologist who says the Deadlands are spotted with seven hundred and seventy-seven different fortifications. There's only a handful here, so these must be really important!"
"15453358-2-437";"I've read Zexelax's Guide, and half of it's utter fiction. A Daedroth horn can deflect a sword stroke or two, sure. But without alchemical hardening, it would never hold up to serious abuse. Some Daedric spellsmith put a lot of work into this."
"15453358-2-438";"Oblivion minerals are hard to categorize. Every Daedric realm operates by its own set of peculiar rules, and the materials of Princely realms often mimic their master's temperament. The composition of a Deadland ore may change by the hour!"
"15453358-2-439";"It's only because this is an item with utility. Daedra can't create anything that lacks utility. That's not hyperbole. Only creatures of Aedric origin can create objects for their own sake. If you find me a Daedric still life, I'll change my mind!"
"15453358-2-440";"The Mages Guild's surveys of Oblivion indicate there's far more void-travel than we suspected. Dremora and Aureal societies are both highly regimented and warlike. Given the existence of Fargrave, it's certainly possible that they engage in trade."
"15453358-2-441";"Oh, Gabrielle, there are so many theories about Daedric remains! We have to discuss this over tea some time! My theory is, high concentrations of dynamic forces result in longer shelf-life. That's why Dremora's hearts persist for so long!"
"15453358-2-442";"I'm no expert on Dremora, but when two clans work together to put another down, it doesn't take an expert to know that is no small matter. The fact that these symbols are scratched out is telling as well."
"15453358-2-443";"The weight of this coil and the significance of it seems worth mentioning. This was obviously something worn by a very high ranking Dremora, or perhaps worn to signify rank to others? Perhaps there were other clans stacked around this coil?"
"15453358-2-444";"One of their leaders maybe. A Markyn? I always get their tusking ranks mixed up. The craftsmanship suggests this was constructed for more than your average grunt, at any rate. Something to show off their rank to the lower castes and their peers."
"15453358-2-445";"Oh, it's mined. I know it! It's a ""naturally occurring"" mineral in the Deadlands. As if anything is natural there, right? Exciting, since anything occurring naturally in the Deadlands is some aspect of Dagon's will in physical form. Marvelous!"
"15453358-2-446";"I think if it were unstable, we'd have known by now. That's the last word I'd use to describe this, it's been meticulously rendered. If Daedra cared at all about wealth, this would probably be quite pricy."
"15453358-2-447";"Ooh, that's interesting, Reginus! But if that's the case, why in Y'ffre's name was something like this in the Deadlands? Perhaps an Imperial mage stumbled upon Dagon's realm by accident? Or some Dremora are interested in Belharza's legend?"
"15453358-2-448";"I found a summoning ritual in Maborel's Tome of Rites that uses a diamond as its primary focus. This is Nibenese spellcraft, of course, so the crimson hue in the diamond is no accident. Whatever this summoned relates to St. Alessia somehow."
"15453358-2-449";"I think you're right about it belonging to an Imperial battlemage, Ugron. See the scoring on the interior of the band? They're Isandor grips—meant to keep the ring from slipping off. You find them on livelier magic rings that vibrate on the finger."
"15453358-2-450";"Note the curvature of the horns. This twisting slope corresponds with Tertia Gallus's heretical renderings of Belharza from 1E 1300s. This distinctive horn shape is one of the only aesthetic features that sets him apart from his famous father."
"15453358-2-451";"Yes. Morihaus's horns I should think. Or his son Belharza's. I've always considered this business about Morihaus and Belharza being actual bull-men specious drivel, but they don't make it easy! Early Alessian priests might have honored them with this oil."
"15453358-2-460";"Gift, or tribute? King Olaf One-Eye took the Dragon Numinex captive around that time. I have heard the Dragon paid for its life by providing the kings of Skyrim with draconic armor. Rewards for great champions."
"15453358-2-461";"Not every Nord who masters the Voice is a Dragonborn. Yes, a Tongue is a great champion, and wields a power akin to a Dragon's. But the kings of Skyrim often chose such heroes to be their elite guards and captains."
"15453358-2-462";"Amalien is correct. Many Nords joined the All Flags Navy, including a band known as the Dov-rha Axethanes. They were elite warriors who served as guards and champions to the kings of Skyrim in the last years of the First Era."
"15453358-2-463";"Indeed. Ancient Nord chronicles sometimes mention Dov-rha warriors or Dov-rha thanes ... dov-rha being a Nordic word for Dragon. But only a great champion or beloved chief would wear armor of this sort."
"15453358-2-464";"These belong to a Dov-rha axethane of the 1E Nord Empire--the kings of Skyrim awarded their bravest warriors with armor crafted from Dragons. Likely handed down for generations until a Nord hero of the All Flags Navy brought them to High Isle."
"15453358-2-465";"Never seen anything quite like it. It appears to have been harvested for some dark purpose. Honestly, it appears ready to crawl across my face and push through my nostril. I'd strongly advise caution."
"15453358-2-466";"The normally soft and pliable sclera has a hard, almost keratin-esque quality to it. I wouldn't advise handling it with bare hands. Objects like this often leave stains that are impossible to wash off."
"15453358-2-467";"I took some time to reread Elizanev's Treatise on Otherworldly Garments. Apparently, when threaded through a needle and sewn into a piece of linen, this thread will make the linen move and undulate in a distasteful and organic fashion. Horrific!"
"15453358-2-468";"This thing definitely moves of its own accord, but I don't know if that indicates life, or just an unsettling enchantment. I'm obliged to wonder, if this eye can perceive what we're doing, is there someone watching on the other end?"
"15453358-2-469";"Well noted, Ugron, but the skin lives still. My research indicates that some sort of alchemical treatment might be preserving this sheathing in a state of quasi-life. Further study is required. Unfortunately."
"15453358-2-470";"According to my studies, most of the onyx mines in pre-Ra Gada Yokuda were seized from the Lefthanded Elves as spoils of war. The Redguards' ancestors never really developed the knack for this sort of gemcutting. I think this is a Lefthander relic."
"15453358-2-471";"Chrysocollas are strongly associated with defense, but in the Yoku tongue, the term defense is just a different tense of offense. They placed far less emphasis on defense as a concept that than the Lefthanders did. This is definitely Elven."
"15453358-2-472";"It's from a belt, all right--a Lefthander shield-girdle. According to Zirad's Guide to Yokuda, Lefthanded Elves worked hard to protect the abdomen because that was the throne of the soul. Also, no one likes being disemboweled."
"15453358-2-473";"According to Yokudan histories, the boundary between pet and livestock was a hazy line for the Lefthanders. Yath Asp leather was stout stuff--resistant to cuts and gouges. It was the perfect material for a stylish war girdle."
"15453358-2-474";"There's a story about The HoonDing Gong. Apparently, Diagna crashed his fist against it and swords fell from the walls of the Orichalc Tower like needles from a dry pine! I wouldn't tell a Crown that Lefthanders made belts from sacred metal!"
"15453358-2-475";"These are of Sea Elf make, but they're not like the trinkets that pirates wear now. See this banding? This is venom-crucible steel. Sea Elves stopped making it due to the cost of the materials. It's a wicked kind of metal, but still, masterful work."
"15453358-2-476";"The chain's enchantments are extraordinary! They seem bound to the concept of focus at the expense of potential outcomes. Not unlike Psijic time-hewing. Paring down choice is a dangerous prospect, but there must be some utility to it."
"15453358-2-477";"I read a treatise on Sea Elf pearl culturing as a teenager. I had a lot of free time! Anyway, there was some debate about whether mer-made pearls had alchemical potential similar to natural pearls. Based on this discovery, I think they do!"
"15453358-2-478";"If meteoric beads like this have real magical potential, it's strange that you don't see more mages wearing them. I discovered a bead like this in a Sea Elf wreck near Vulkhel Guard. Maybe the Pyandoneans are the only ones who've mastered the craft."
"15453358-2-479";"I'm more interested in its origins than its powers. This gem cutting technique is foreign to me. It almost looks like a lapidary tumbled it in a sand pail after the final cuts. Sea Elves favor unusual cuts. I wager this came from Pyandonea."
"15453358-2-480";"Wood Elves adore working with petrified wood, but this doesn't show any signs of Elven craftsmanship. It's of Breton make. Given the magic its radiating, I'd wager a druid made this at least eight hundred years ago. Probably more!"
"15453358-2-481";"The etchings are draoifoglyphs--druidic runes. It's not my area of expertise, but I think they say something like, to root or to grasp firmly. The stones feel a bit heavy, don't they? Maybe they're meant to hold something in place."
"15453358-2-482";"This is a real find. This framing bridges the gap between Nedic stonework and early Direnni aesthetics and draws from the best of both traditions. Druids were master stonecutters and fair hands at magic--I'd say they made this."
"15453358-2-483";"In High Rock, we mostly hear about the wyrd sisters using Y'ffre Tears in their witch's brews, but I read it also played a large role in druidic spellcraft. They'd apply it to their staves, wax their beards with it, and so on. Fascinating!"
"15453358-2-484";"Dark Elves love their volcanoes, but yes, I understand that an entire circle of druids base their religion around Firesong. I read that it represents immovable strength. Maybe the magic invested in these flakes has something to do with that?"
"15453358-2-510";"People find the primacy of stone in druid culture unusual, but really, stone is no less natural than trees. What's unique about the druids is their belief in manmer's ability to enhance or perfect nature. Quite unlike other animists like the wyrd."
"15453358-2-511";"It's said that Admiral Uhlchesis' fleet raided the shores of Alinor more than a dozen times before his dark master called him to Apocrypha. They sacked enough gold for a hundred helms, though most of his ships were thought lost after their leader left Nirn."
"15453358-2-512";"That smudge--as you so inaccurately put it--is an eighth of the sigil of Admiral Bendu Olo. If this map of High Isle bears his personal seal, and not that of the Empire, then it likely dates beck to 1E 2241."
"15453358-2-513";"A good note, Gabrielle, thank you. I was planning to write a small paper on some of the relics coming in from the Systres. Let's co-author a piece and incorporate just this angle in our findings. I will follow up."
"15453358-2-514";"One of the elements I find most interesting is these leftover reliefs showcasing the Archdruid. A figure of great debate among scholars, after the breaking of the druids into different sects his symbology disappears almost overnight."
"15453358-2-517";"I believe you're onto something. Notice the facets and how they refract light towards a distant point. I posit that this is just part of a focusing crystal once used to collect and store energy, whether magical or otherwise I'm not entirely sure."
"15453358-2-518";"By tradition these stones allowed the druids to tell long-form stories over days or even weeks! Each person chose a stone to add to a central area. The order and placement of the stones add meaning and context, a remarkable tale-telling custom."
"15453358-2-520";"Interesting. Fauns have historically had contentious relationships with the other inhabitants of the Systres, but they weren't always violent. Whoever made this must have had quite the quarrel with them."
"15453358-2-521";"I read a troubling tale once about a group of Fauns who stuffed a man's mouth full of garlic cloves after tying him up. They are known to adorn themselves in the pungent bulbs. Could this be something of theirs?"
"15453358-2-522";"Well, whatever this was it clearly wasn't meant to be worn by a Faun Lord themself. These markings might have more power to them than just a good warning if someone went to the trouble to sew them into fabric."
"15453358-2-523";"By the feel of them, I'd say they're Faun antlers. They're not particularly old, likely fallen during a molt. And our talented crafter found themselves quite lucky while adventuring through the Systres."
"15453358-2-524";"I've heard this as well. No one is quite sure when or why Fauns had this hair or when it disappeared, but I can see why any crafter from the past might have wanted a material such as this for making apparel. It's certainly...tough."
"15453358-2-525";"A targeted piece of apparel and you think it stops at denoting which group a member belongs to? Haven't you read about the Raven's Green necklace? The True Way on these dials implies that only one of the circles actually follows in Y'ffre's footsteps."
"15453358-2-526";"Regardless of what the knots symbolize, did either of you happen to look at the cord itself? It looks like it's made out of cotton and flax. That's probably what the knots symbolize, two materials they use to make clothing."
"15453358-2-527";"A fourth circle? How marvelous, though even I find that hard to believe. A better explanation would be that the fourth strand in the braid represents Y'ffre so that the promise of unity between the circles extends to the one they all worship."
"15453358-2-528";"Now that you mention it, these brambles look like a type of grave grass we had on Summerset. That must be their origin. The druids wear them to keep the lifeforce of their departed loved-ones by their sides."
"15453358-2-529";"Reginus' translation is accurate though the druids take it much less literally. They regard this weaving symbol as the Knots of the Earthbones, but describe the Earthbones as more of the lines of natural energy that flow through the ground."
"15453358-2-530";"All indications suggest this was primary source. If the papers are true and Syrabane himself did develop the process to artificially create the metal, this may have been forged by his hand. It's certainly old enough."
"15453358-2-531";"Disconnect from broad Tamriel norms, you say. Regardless of the editorializing, it's beautiful. If the stories are true and Syrabane did teach my people this art, it's a gift we can never repay him for. I wish we still had the knack."
"15453358-2-532";"Symbolically, the pearl's association with the hard shells of clams could represent some kind of defensive element? I can think of a half dozen ways to incorporate pearlwater in protective magics, though I've never seen a reagent quite like this."
"15453358-2-533";"I believe I may have an answer. A tiny stamp on one of the braces, a maker's mark. Syrabane himself, from the time of the All-Flags Navy. Perhaps, as you said, Verita, he forged this melting pot of metals in symbolic resonance to the armada."
"15453358-2-534";"I am going to go with the former. Or at least, I posit that the crafter at least had some respect for Summerset social norms. I believe the beast was dead for some time before the strap was cut free, fitting for a beast so majestic."
"15453358-2-535";"Not a literal marriage, then. That explains Y'ffelon, and the depiction of Vastyr in its infancy suggests this was charted sometime around 1E 2240. A shame the union didn't last, but I suppose two centuries together is more than most of us dare hope for."
"15453358-2-536";"Isn't it fascinating how warm it remains even this long removed from the field? If their eggs are this sturdy perhaps the rumors of these beasts swimming in seas of magma below ground are not all that far-fetched!"
"15453358-2-537";"I have to agree. I see heavy Breton influence in the construction, but it's early. Probably right around the time of the first shipyards in Gonfalon Bay!"
"15453358-2-542";"This turnstyle doesn't have a druidic symbol, see the coloration and angle? It's more likely that whoever stained this wood is a Breton paying homage to the druids. That's the only way I can explain the different techniques and patterns."
"15453358-2-543";"Blizzards aren't exactly concerns for the druids of the Systres. Besides, druids construct using multifaceted stones and cover them with clay from the banks of Y'ffre's Tears for a smooth finish. I doubt anything could topple those towers."
"15453358-2-544";"Amalien's wild theory may not be far from the truth. I wrote to a fellow Antiquarian on High Isle who said the druids sometimes call the song 'Blessings of Stone.' This melody may be one of the things the Aldmer passed down to the Bretons."
"15453358-2-545";"Druids generally prefer working with bronze or iron if they have to. But, what if this key wasn't forged by a druid? See how it's been polished? Druids prefer their metals to tarnish naturally. This was probably made by a Breton crafter in Galen."
"15453358-2-546";"Did you take a look at some of the lower class music books? This comb can play a variety of tunes from 'Ballads from Balfiera'. I'm not sure what tune this comb plays, but I'd wager that it comes from the Nedic traditions."
"15453358-2-547";"Verita is right! There are a great deal of landmarks here that I don't recognize from modern portrayals of Fargrave. Could they be ancient, forgotten fortifications of the Celestial Palanquin? Or just the wanderings of a withering mortal mind?"
"15453358-2-548";"Reginus is correct. I'd hazard to say this might have been made by the engineers and laborers tasked with the construction of the monument that commemorated the fleet's triumph over the Sload."
"15453358-2-549";"Ah! Interesting, thank you, Verita. Now that I examine it more closely, I see what you mean. There are also grooves on the sides, perhaps this was a drawer? It could have been an attachment to store tools within a larger work station."
"15453358-2-557";"Aesthetic commentary aside, a beautiful piece of clothing meant to venerate an ancestor priest. The role the dead play in Dark Elf culture is hard to understand, but you need only look at the time and attention given to this piece to see it firsthand."
"15453358-2-558";"Easy to forget, given the Dark Elf view on undeath, that tending to ancestors can sometimes be hazardous. The original wearer of this garment no doubt looked to this padding to ensure longevity in their role."
"15453358-2-559";"You're exactly correct, Thumog. A garment from far-flung Necrom, the end-goal of so many pilgrimages. The finery draped around these ancestor priests no doubt helped ease the minds of many families, proof that their loved ones were in good hands."
"15453358-2-560";"This kind of adaptation is a hallmark of Morrowind culture, further back than we have written records. I find fascinating the duality of the fine cloth these were meant to adorn and the humble nature of the material itself. Symbology for life and death?"
"15453358-2-561";"The need for Dark Elf pilgrims to connect with those who have gone before no doubt prompted this finery. Imagine this glowing in the light of a hundred candles, the peace and serenity it would bring to those gathered for a reverential ceremony."
"15453358-2-562";"Dwemer scholars explored the length and breadth of Nirn, and well beyond. Perhaps this plating was proof against the extremes they might encounter in seeking the truths of Aetherius. Could have used this during a few rough expeditions myself."
"15453358-2-563";"Dwemer, with post-diaspora techniques and an advanced fiberweave I've seen used in a scant few artifacts. The artisan's name has been lost to time but I recognize their split anvil maker's mark from other works of exceptional quality."
"15453358-2-564";"More than we've ever been able to prove before. The Dwemer reaching out to other regions for support in their more advanced workings is a fascinating concept. Was this a common practice, or was this more like a favor repaid to a specific artisan?"
"15453358-2-565";"They're also extremely well insulated from adverse conditions, as we've seen with several other pieces recently. Just imagine what a person wearing these greaves could endure."
"15453358-2-566";"You mock me when I contextualize everything through Dwemer culture but ... this was done by the Deep Elves. I've found minimal evidence for Dwemer cultivation of Daedra populations, however, so this represents an extreme outlier in Dwemeric practices."
"15453358-2-567";"It's older than you think. In fact, this is not Nibenese silk at all. The bird pattern is Ayleid, from the early First Era. Everyone knows the Heartland Elves were the first to weave ancestor silk."
"15453358-2-568";"Oh! Of course. I should have put two and two together. Yes, the Ayleids often used feather and talon motifs in their work. I'd love to see the rest of this medallion; it must have been impressive."
"15453358-2-569";"I've seen this triquetra  before, in the ruins of Nenalata. It was the emblem of the royal house. This medallion might have been looted from a king's tomb when the Alessian Order razed the city."
"15453358-2-570";"Ah. The so-called ""feathered jewels"" were associated with House Dynar, the royal line of long-lost Nenalata. I always wondered what exactly the ancient scribes meant by that turn of phrase."
"15453358-2-571";"Aetherial gems were potent tools in the hands of a mage. This one likely belonged to an Ayleid sorcerer-king. I recall an ancient text that described the ""blue gem"" of a king of Nenalata. Could this be one such gem?"
"15453358-2-572";"You are both wrong. This chain dates back to the High Velothi culture. The sword-pattern honors Boethiah, Daedric patron to the ancient Chimer. The Hortators came later."
"15453358-2-573";"Beetle motifs in Morrowind make me think of High Velothi mages. When Veloth led the Chimer to their new home, they drew inspiration from creatures they found there. Beetles came to symbolize knowledge."
"15453358-2-574";"Ancient Altmer design motifs rendered with alloys found in Morrowind point to the High Velothi culture. Why, this predates the Battle of Red Mountain and Azura's Curse by hundreds of years!"
"15453358-2-575";"Not quite. Ancient Chimer texts refer to ""those who wear the shalk."" Apparently, the most powerful mages of High Veloth had amulets in the form of ebony shalks, and were granted the title ""Ur-Mage."""
"15453358-2-576";"High Velothi ur-mages, the most powerful sorcerers of the ancient Chimer, wore ""a light upon the breast"" for protection when dealing with Daedra. This lucent might be one of those very stones!"
"15453358-2-577";"Agreed. I would go so far to say that this is Akaviri in origin. It could be a set of battle plans from an early invasion, but I think it was an early portolan chart, used for early, peaceful trade between the continents."
"15453358-2-578";"Agreed that the votive comes from an earlier age, Gabrielle, but unlikely that it dates from Prior Durdryn's time. The etchings portray a well-developed Necrom, with structures built long after its founding. Ancient still, though."
"15453358-2-579";"Note the vertical hole bored from the bowl to the base. This was likely a grave offering, a krater used by the deceased in life. On their passing, the family bored the hole in the base to provide libations in the afterlife."
"15453358-2-588";"It's so tiny. And cute. And I think built to go flush with whatever it belongs to - so that it isn't easily seen. And that makes me think this belongs to something artistic. Oh, and that rune hiding inside it? I think it means find. Interesting!"
"15453358-2-589";"I think your tomeshell didn't like being near something crafted from a dead friend, Gabrielle. I see two smaller runes on each one. I think they mean attract and oppose. So, some form of movement is involved with these, I'd say."
"15453358-2-598";"Shift it a bit more in the light, Reginus, and it says attract instead. I think. Depending on the light, it can either draw something in or push something out. Oooh, I need to study arcanist runes more!"
"15453358-2-599";"That rune is the maker's mark of Adonia of the Heart's Ache - an artist from the First Era. Adonia's voice sent many an erstwhile suitor to their graves when they got too ... persistent. And anything Adonia crafted involved music in some form."
"15453358-2-600";"I can see an argument for the metal choice being pure aesthetics. But look more closely at the wispmetal wire holding the springs together. It's an eye. Hermaeus Mora. The device these came from must have honored the One Who Knows. I'm sure of it!"
"15453358-2-601";"The lands of Oblivion represent the minds of the Daedric Princes, and warp and change as they themselves change and grow. In a century's time, our maps of Apocrypha will be as out of date and this one seems to be."
"15453358-2-602";"I can't even begin to describe the amount of care that must've gone into this work's creation. The detailing and characterization of every included fungus is the closest fungal research has ever come to poetry. This is nothing short of a masterwork."
"15453358-2-603";"But cartilage often breaks down long before the fossilization process begins. I'm starting to lean towards a type of chitin. Not external like we see in crustaceans, but an internal structure not dissimilar to fungal cell walls. Much to consider."
"15453358-2-604";"A vile and horrible thing. A stone nightmare made all the more loathsome by the omission of its sender's names. I won't get any work done while this sits in my study and none of my assistants want to move it."
"15453358-2-605";"Considering these fossils also resemble curled up tentacles, I'll posit an even more terrifying thought. Could nautili be severed appendages made sentient? Silly, perhaps, but there's a flittering connection that should be explored further."
"15453358-2-606";"Additional note to self, we've found several more of these fossil structures without any sign of additional segments. Could these in fact be chitinous defense plating of some large, larval like creature? I can already feel Verita's unamused eyebrow."
"15453358-2-607";"Twice now I've passed your study and stifled a scream at the sight of your Cliff Strider … friend. And once again, I must politely decline your offer to, ''get to know him."" I'll leave its delicate bones and leathery skin to you."
"15453358-2-608";"On the contrary, its simplicity makes it far more likely to be a private piece. Those of means often flagrantly display their favored member of the Tribunal. This beautiful glass was likely commissioned by someone of simple means, but fierce devotion."
"15453358-2-609";"Some remote Dunmer cultures once built these rings of stone deep below ground much like a water well. It was common practice to drop sacrificial animals down the well to satiate their chosen Daedric Prince. This may be the base of such a well."
"15453358-2-610";"I believe you are both correct. Once a well, I believe this was changed into a ritual idol for worshippers of Hermaeus Mora. So, Dunmer in origin but repurposed by others, perhaps Nords? Cults in Skyrim have gone largely unstudied."
"15453358-2-611";"Your caution is well-taken, Ugron, but we are fine. This is not an invasion point, but a reverent decoration. The tendrils a like a potted plant used by Nord cultists to adorn their ritual sites. They're as dangerous as a fern."
"15453358-2-612";"This frame's composition flows from Apocrypha, no question. The additional decorations make that clear. The energy similarities you noticed could mean Mora and Namira have a closer relationship than I realized!"
"15453358-2-613";"We've found trinkets made of obsidian glass in the graves of Nedic leaders. It's uncommon for that culture to make a mirror with this swirling decoration, but I know of shrines in northern Hammerfell where this would fit right in."
"15453358-2-614";"If you compare the stone craftmanship to the etchings in Hositte's From Pebbles to Boulders, you'll see a perfect match with ancient Nedic work. The Daedric runes are uncommon, but not unheard of. A pleasure to see the handiwork up close."
"15453358-2-625";"Look closely at the lower right inside corner. See that partially obscured maker's mark? If I'm not mistaken, that's the Girvayne family's symbol. They crafted pieces for musicians in the First Era. So, this may be part of an instrument."
"15453358-2-626";"This metal puzzles me still. This isn't wispmetal quenched in tomeshell gore, is it? Given the slight striations I'm seeing ... yes, it must be. An Oblivion rarity!"
"15453358-2-627";"Perhaps it belongs to an arcanist's locking device, where you need to line up symbols exactly to open it. That said, the overall shape of the comb reminds me of a music box's mechanism."
"15453358-2-628";"A faint rune on this gear marks it as being something an arcanist crafted. My sense of it, not knowing what greater machinery it once ran, is that it means eternal. Not a bad thing to ask for when working with gears."
"15453358-2-629";"Oh, you're right, Ugron! There's an arcanist's rune right on the tip, too. I think it's a rune of bonding of some sort. Adherence? Not adhesive. Maybe if we find its mechanized companions, it will magically stick to the correct piece."
"15453358-2-630";"I do wonder how the claws were harvested. Seekers are fierce adversaries. Perhaps the ancient scholars gathered them from deceased corpses? Or maybe the claws were collected from live specimens as a punishment for sloppy research."
"15453358-2-631";"There's a more obvious explanation for this quantity of watcher ink. Given Mora's preference for contracts, this vial was used by lesser watchers to sign mortals into their service. After all, how much ink does one need to sign their name?"
"15453358-2-633";"Perhaps. This stone does look more polished than some of the other Khajiit structures we've seen here. Perhaps a descendant fighting a battle of preservation."
"15453358-2-634";"Friends, this is a well. These usually reside in the countryside, possibly near an idyllic cottage. As for the arch, if it's not broken, why fix it?"
"15453358-2-635";"""A first for knowledge usually leads to a thirst for more,"" as the saying goes. We should investigate further, without a doubt. Our understanding of this fascinating people is under-developed."
"15453358-2-636";"If you've never had the opportunity, attending a ceremony on one of the Dark Elf high holy days is incredible. Seeing generation upon generation of the dead walking between the gravestones is a moving, and sometimes terrifying, experience."
"15453358-2-637";"I had the privilege of attending a Vossa-satl performance in Shadowfen, it was a difficult time, and the music helped clear the mind. A whole chorus of these little statues winked at us from the shadows as I listened."
"15453358-2-638";"More likely time, theft, and exposure has scoured away whatever made this shrine unique. Still a beautiful piece, and one worth preserving."
"15453358-2-639";"Seht's ways are mysterious, very true. I've done some research and tried to place it within the schematics I have here in the library. Nothing matches exactly, but hope springs eternal."
"15453358-2-640";"I'll have to consult with Ugron, he may have some insight into the conceptual elements behind this. Thank you Gabrielle, a unique discovery indeed."
"15453358-2-641";"We've seen similar vessels in the Hammerfell region. But other techniques, like rain-catchers, supplement the base vessels. I'd imagine originally this had some kind of awning or cover as well."
"15453358-2-642";"Was that a joke, Amalien? Well maintained? In any case I agree Reginus, temples and arches are all well and good. But the lay-architecture that stands the test of time is truly the most lasting imprint a people can have on a region."
"15453358-2-643";"I've braved research expeditions to the Daedric realms before and frankly I cannot recommend it. Still, it's a unique chance to study the culture and mindset of Daedric societies."
"15453358-2-647";"Mortal make, it seems. But guided by a Daedric hand."
"15453358-2-648";"The fabric itself may be resonant with Daedric energy, but each thread is laced with a fated strand of Apocrypha itself. Perhaps weaving it into something puts the wearer in fate's favor? Mora, always mysterious!"
"15453358-2-649";"As history has taught us countless times: a weapon or tool is hailed for its use rather than its appearance. And yet, what an appearance this has."
"15453358-2-650";"They're treadles, Ugron. I loved using these on my loom back in Summerset. High Elf children can tend to be cruel just as they are cunning, and having a hobby helped channel my frustrations."
"15453358-2-651";"I've traded with Malachite and could recognize its glow with my eyes closed - this is brighter and more absorbing. It seems to power something for infinite use, and neither magicka is hardly endless."
"15453358-2-652";"As much as I hate to disagree with Ugron, he sees graves everywhere. No, likely this carving had a different purpose - you'll note there's no epitaph. For a culture so concerned with hoarding knowledge and writing, this would be a major oversight."
"15453358-2-653";"You're not seeing the whole picture. This base contains conduits for the flow of energy, yes, but this is not the entirety of its purpose. It must be part of a larger mechanism, perhaps enabling an arcane energy transfer."
"15453358-2-654";"Amalien's last note got me thinking. I exposed the engraving to arcane energy, which caused the stone itself to glow green! When placed in context with the whole, this item must have conferred some of Mora's powers on his ancient scholars."
"15453358-2-655";"Valiant effort, Reginus. But you have left out one key piece: Apocrypha is a realm of secret and forbidden knowledge. This text is probably written in an ancient code, which is why the title is impossible to decipher."
"15453358-2-656";"I'm not sure why I didn't see this before. It's a table of contents! Granted, the page numbers and sections keep shifting. I'm not sure if it's part of the arcane cipher, or because the information is literally moving around in the pages."
"15453358-2-657";"Amalien makes good points, though it is also crucial to note that watcher ink was a rare resource in ancient Apocrypha. It is difficult to obtain and therefore only used sparingly. This text undoubtedly contains precious secrets."
"15453358-2-658";"Hmm, I'm not sure that's correct, Verita. Mora's followers were more concerned with research than meditation. In fact, I believe the colored light was likely used to decode hidden messages and reveal secrets written in special ink."
"15453358-2-659";"The tentacles seem to be docile so it didn't really cross my mind to involve an outside collaborator. I've found endless knowledge inside books but Arcanists unnerve me."
"15453358-2-660";"My analysis leads me to believe a mage attempted to wrest control of this Watcher from Mora, violently. Perhaps it holds secrets the Knower wished to keep."
"15453358-2-661";"Entry 3: I awoke in the middle of the night with a surge of inspiration. Some research later, the light now shines across formerly blank tomes and pages, revealing words and symbols my eyes have never seen. Discovery!"
"15453358-2-662";"Profit, would be my guess. Someone must have realized too late they were tricked by this beautiful creation and thrown it away."
"15453358-2-663";"That's all well and good, but the cold fire of the brazier seems more practical than mystical. A cold fire will burn paper, after all, and is more than bright enough to read by."
"15453358-2-664";"Well said. But well. It's also a light. With how murky Apocrypha can get, all the time, maybe they just wanted some light?"
"15453358-2-665";"You're both missing a key idea: tentacles. What if these aren't ribs, but rather the hardened remains of tentacles? They could have been used to scoop prey into an oddly situated mouth at the center of the body. Apocrypha has no shortage of wonders."
"15453358-2-666";"You're both right, of course. But the bone in the skull area is porous, suggesting a large nasal cavity. What other use would a slug have for such a sense unless it was a hunter that tracked its prey by smell?"
"15453358-2-667";"Amalien's point raises a question: were the tentacles beneficial to the safehouse in some way? They could have been used as a trap to stop intruders and prying eyes from stealing Mora's secrets. Do ciphers still use similar security measures today?"
"15453358-2-668";"I hate to add to the conflict, but it's not purely ecological or biological. This organism is a melding of a plant from Tamriel with the arcane forces of Apocrypha. It was nurtured in volatile arcane soil and became something else altogether."
"15453358-2-669";"My colleagues did not recognize this as Dwemer work. The Dwemer had few sources for leather of exceptional quality, so they sometimes obtained materials from Ayleid artisans. But they would have only used it for work of great importance."
"15453358-2-670";"Aetherium crystals powered many Dwemer marvels, yes. But this is not a simple power source. Somehow, this crystal has been hollowed out. I believe this is a resonance chamber for a device harnessing Dwemer tonal magic. An incredible find!"
"15453358-2-671";"These are no common picks. The high artisans of Volenfell often began important projects by forging the tools they would need for the work. I believe these tools were made to craft a special piece of armor, and likely never used again."
"15453358-2-672";"Ah, I know this design! This repeating squared-arrow pattern comes from Santaki, a Dwemer city that stood in what is now the Alik'r Desert. This was part of a mighty armored gauntlet crafted by the Rourken smiths of Hammerfell long ago."
"15453358-2-673";"My colleague's insight serves her well. I have seen similar mechanisms in the Dwemer ruins of Stros M'Kai. The smiths of Bthzark were skilled in the art of tonal architecture. I think these pipes were fitted to gauntlets that harnessed tonal magic."
"15453358-2-674";"I strongly sense the chill of Evergloam, good guess Amalien. Imagine what a thief might do with a set of gloves or a mask stitched with these? The power of the Shadow Queen herself imbued into a garment. Oh my."
"15453358-2-675";"Verita interpreted the runes too literally. When etched into armor these would help them hunt victory on the battlefield. These runes are etched in a place where they are easy to conceal. These are thieves' leathers blessed for successful heists."
"15453358-2-676";"Verita's correct. I read a story of a watchman in Alinor who accidentally embedded a fleck of gloamium in his eye in 2E 367. The story goes that he lost sight during the day, but could see perfectly well at night. I bet these rivets do the same."
"15453358-2-677";"We found several more writings about this liquid that were previously viewed as farcical. If enough of it is used, the material becomes nearly impossible to detect. I'm glad this sample is tightly sealed."
"15453358-2-678";"The poems reference knights and knaves so I think they deal with the Blackfeather Court. There's a record of an Imperial scribe going missing in 2E 219. The scribe was found several days later with a pocket full of jewels. Payment, I suppose."
"15453358-2-679";"The Shivering Isles. Under magical examination the salt crystals appear to the same as those taken from the Enjaen Sea to the East of the realm's main landmass. I read a paper once noting that the seawater also held trace metals in the water. Riveting."
"15453358-2-680";"I referenced the University's collection of Dementia-crafted items, to great success. Originating in that cursed county seat within the Shivering Isles, this clasping no doubt bears a tragic tale all its own."
"15453358-2-681";"I can confirm after a visit Reginus' desk that this cameo is indeed ""making faces"" at him. I've arranged a consulation with an Arcanist Gabrielle knows through her correspondence series, perhaps he will have some insights into this phenomenon."
"15453358-2-682";"The other artisan to this piece was, for lack of a better phrase, a mad genius. Artistry for the sake of it, needless complexity, to the point where their half of the yoke is most likely quite difficult to actually slip into place against a chain."
"15453358-2-683";"After Reginus' time with the Aureal cameo I thought it might be interesting to bring both companion pieces together for co-examination. A note here for the files: never do that again. My eyebrows are still growing in and Reginus will be bruised for weeks."
"15453358-2-684";"I'm also intrigued by the engraved decorations. Looks like a ring of bears dancing around the outside of the decanter. I suppose Count Calantius's love for his ursine companion has historical precedent."
"15453358-2-685";"Spot-on as always, Reginus! In fact, the carvings around this mirror are indicative of Daedric worship, specific to the First Era. With the right spell, this mirror could be used to view other planes. I wonder if those other planes could look back?"
"15453358-2-687";"It's not for merchants. This is a Redguard military map. See the emphasis on the landscape over cities or towns. An invading force needs to know the safest paths through the region. Based on its age, I suspect this comes from the War of Rihad."
"15453358-2-688";"Ah, another classic tapestry from the great weaver Rhea Truiand. Her work was in high demand among estates in the last First Era. In fact, a brutal feud started between two families over one of her pieces. Perhaps this very one!"
"15453358-2-689";"Good catch with those trees. The Gentle Prince was very popular among Colovian children in the early Second Era. Most likely this was hung in a child's bedroom or playroom. Merchant families loved the story of a Prince gaining wealth from hard work."
"15453358-2-690";"Be fair to yourself, Gabrielle. This isn't your specialty. The tapestry depicts the long-destroyed gateway to the Cruscellio lands. That family line was supposedly wiped out, but claiming lineage has become popular."
"15453358-2-691";"This painting is of the 'Lady of the Vine' folkstory. It's confirmed by the scroll at her feet. The Lady also looks a lot like a portrait of Countess Ornelda Calvus, which makes sense since she published the first record of that story as well."
"15453358-2-692";"There was a master vase painter in Cropsford in the early second era who specialized in black figure pottery. All the details you see here are extremely difficult to get precise with the pottery slip. This has to be Martina Russus's work."
"15453358-2-693";"I found a book from called 'Scholar's Rite' by Telburnalin. It looks like these trees were crafted for Ayleid scholars. Each branch represents the students they guided to enlightenment."
"15453358-2-694";"I looked into the combination of the tree shape and materials used to make this tree and I think it was connected to a ritual of Magnus. The Ayleids had temples dedicated to sight, light, and insight and it's possible this was created by one of them."
"15453358-2-695";"I'd wager it was how you put it to them, Verita. As for this sculpture, the Ayleids in the past used Welkynd to store magicka. Small cracks in the crystals might be letting it seep through."
"15453358-2-696";"I sense a faint trace of Daedric influence on parts of it, far from dangerous now. This might be the remnants of a Daedraphile kingdom after the Alessian slave rebellion. No, I'm certain of it!"
"15453358-2-697";"I've never known welkynd to crack from too much magic. But you're right, Amalein. This window wasn't meant for simple gazing. And someone saw something they shouldn't have with this."
"15453358-2-698";"Focus on the lenses. It appears to concentrates light rays when the sun is at its peak and stores it in the crystal. Simple, yet resourceful. Even now, welkynd burns bright in their ruins."
"15453358-2-699";"Actually, this slab may be even older than Verita thinks. The polish of the stone, the smoothness of the lines, they all point to Ayleid culture! Rocks can teach us so many things!"
"15453358-2-700";"I can tell you've both been neglecting your arcane studies a bit. Don't those cracks remind you of anything? Perhaps some magically-charged Ayleid ruins? This smith likely made enchanted weapons."
"15453358-2-701";"Yes, Ugron, strength and flexibility are important, but we're talking about the Ayleids here! Their culture was infused with magic. Their decoctions probably contained elements to enchant their tools and weapons as they forged them."
"15453358-2-702";"Don't strain yourself, Gabrielle. The markings aren't runes or enchantments. It's an inscription. It reads: 'To my stalwart smith with love. May your back never ache and your fire never dim.'"
"15453358-2-703";"Moreover, has anyone noticed how relatively small the anvil is? Its size suggests the smith had a proclivity for forging precision tools like daggers or arrowheads over swords or axes. You can't overlook the details on these things!"
"15453358-2-704";"Finally got a chance to examine this again when Verita wasn't looking. Further analysis suggests this is an Ayleid decoration of some kind. It resembles the ornaments we've found on some of their larger remnants, like their palanquins and staffs."
"15453358-2-705";"Of course it's miniature, it's a child's toy! Or a novelty item of some sort. Not everything is as serious as Ugron wants it to be. This item broke off at some point long ago. Even so, it would have been an exquisite gift, from all the detail."
"15453358-2-706";"I knew it! I couldn't sleep last night and found myself musing over the mirror. The cracks are intentional! When gently manipulated, the shards can slide together to create a smooth reflective surface. Ayleid craftsmanship never ceases to amaze me."
"15453358-2-707";"I haven't seen one of these since I was a child. It's a music box. Amalien was surprisingly astute with the keys, but even her nimble fingers can't get the melody to play. I'm eager to hear whatever ancient song this box contains."
"15453358-2-708";"Gabrielle is spot-on. It's the trigger for a music box. I had one as a child, and it had the same sort of teeth at the end. The crystalcruft ornament is decorative, probably made to complement the overall design of the music box it came from."
"15453358-2-709";"You should use your hands for more than holding books, Gabrielle. Such a wheel would aid a laboring craftsman greatly. Attached to a grinding or polishing tool, a lapidary could focus on refining a gem's facet without the need for a treadle."
"15453358-2-710";"Your fixations lead you astray, Amalien. The Dwarves likely used this for the same reason as armies do across Tamriel. For smelting alloys to repair armor. Perfect for quickly making a number of small rings or fasteners."
"15453358-2-711";"The decorative metal tendrils on the base caught my attention. I tested the stove's ability, and it does get unbearably hot. However, the tendrils stayed cold to the touch. I can't tell if its a quirk of the metal or Hermaeus Mora's influence."
"15453358-2-712";"Weapons, jewelry, what's really the difference? With the recent uptick in endowing jewels with magical properties, even a well-faceted diamond could cause physical harm."
"15453358-2-713";"Amalien's intuition seems right this time, Reginus. These tentacle radiate a very slight Daedric power. Nothing dangerous, likely? But any tools hung on this rack would likely be imbued with some Apocryphal energies over time."
"15453358-2-714";"Most certainly not. Examining these gnarled legs reveals they were once fused to a great slab of metal. What managed to separate these shelves from its larger structure is an open question, but I do not wish to meet something that strong."
"15453358-2-715";"The entanglements help more than you realize. They're not made of iron, but an unusual Daedric metal only found in Apocrypha. The strands infuse the brass legs providing significantly more strength. How rare to see something like this on Nirn!"
"15453358-2-716";"You two have scared yourself into thinking this table is imbued with death when there's a simpler explanation. The table's stone absorbs heat, yes. An excellent quality for a jeweler working with hot metals."
"15453358-2-717";"I performed all the tests I could for Daedric influence or curses in general. None of the results came back positive. Just a simple gem holder with an unsettling design. Or is it? It is."
"15453358-2-718";"Good catch, Amalien. These pieces have a unique function. They seem to amplify and channel magicka that's directed at them. If arranged properly, they may funnel energy to a central point. An effective way to enchant jewelry, I'd guess."
