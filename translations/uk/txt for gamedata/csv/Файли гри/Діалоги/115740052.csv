"115740052-0-1406";"Does that not make them angry? I've heard they see the trees as their brothers and sisters."
"115740052-0-1407";"Can't speak for how they feel about it, but we avoid cutting anything near their home, the Wyrd Tree."
"115740052-0-1408";"The Wyrd interest me. Someday, I hope to learn more about them."
"115740052-0-1443";"You're a fool to cross me, mortal. I wish your presence in Quagmire. Come to me."
"115740052-0-1448";"You've fought so hard, and all for nothing! You will die in this dream!"
"115740052-0-1452";"Thieves! You and your Orcs are nothing more than liars and thieves!"

"115740052-0-1454";"We're the liars? How dare you! We want to know what happened to our friends and family members. Where are you holding them?"
"115740052-0-1455";"And what gives you idiots the right to order us about? This is as much our home as it is yours!"
"115740052-0-1461";"Then have at you!"
"115740052-0-1487";"Did the witch send you here <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-1518";"All quiet, Captain. Perhaps we're out of the woods after all."
"115740052-0-1520";"What news, soldier?"
"115740052-0-1521";"Very good. Dismissed."
"115740052-0-1522";"Yes, Captain."
"115740052-0-1602";"Say, Moreau. You ever hear someone rummaging around your things in the middle of the night?"
"115740052-0-1603";"No."
"115740052-0-1604";"Several folks around the Mill have been talking about it, and I've heard it too."
"115740052-0-1605";"Must be rats. Or maybe squirrels."
"115740052-0-1606";"Then they are rats or squirrels of good taste. A ring handed down in my family for generations is now missing."
"115740052-0-1607";"I'm sure your ring will turn up...someplace. We should concentrate on our duties, though, with all the spriggans about."
"115740052-0-1608";"Maybe so. Still, I haven't looked for it at the docks. I'll head there after our shift."
"115740052-0-1629";"Didn't turn out the way you expected, did it?"
"115740052-0-1695";"sighs and shakes his head."

"115740052-0-1709";"My head is swollen with words. Give me a sword. Let them out!"
"115740052-0-1710";"The stars keep moving. The sky is bent. It makes me seasick."
"115740052-0-1711";"I tried to keep the words in the books. They flew out and bit me."
"115740052-0-1712";"What were you saying, Orsiln? I am having trouble focusing."
"115740052-0-1726";"Think me Ranser, do you? No, I am not the mad king. I am his betrayer. Enter the past and hear my tale—a traitor's tale, it is."
"115740052-0-1754";"So … hungry."
"115740052-0-1759";"Hello."
"115740052-0-1760";"Good day to you."
"115740052-0-1761";"Hello again."
"115740052-0-1762";"Good to see you."
"115740052-0-1763";"A moment of your time?"
"115740052-0-1764";"Hi."
"115740052-0-1775";"Angof told me to watch for you. He's offered a small fortune … for your head!"
"115740052-0-1779";"Hail, friend."
"115740052-0-1780";"Greetings."
"115740052-0-1781";"Greetings, friend."
"115740052-0-1782";"Come here a moment."
"115740052-0-1788";"Poor deluded fool."
"115740052-0-1794";"Yes?"
"115740052-0-1795";"What is it?"
"115740052-0-1796";"Do I know you?"
"115740052-0-1797";"What can I do for you?"
"115740052-0-1798";"Well met."
"115740052-0-1799";"Hail!"
"115740052-0-1803";"Oh, it's you."
"115740052-0-1808";"Don't underestimate the Lion Guard. Lord Magister Averos has dealt with your kind before."
"115740052-0-1814";"Your fear of those ignorant witches is laughable, but I'll take of them. Once these bothersome Lion Guard lackeys have been dealt with, my servants will tear the wyrd apart."
"115740052-0-1815";"Ignorant warlock! You know nothing of war. Why leave the safety of Camlorn's walls, when we can force the Lion Guard to destroy themselves besieging them?"
"115740052-0-1816";"Laughable! No mere mortal can best me. Averos will fall, as so many have before him. I'll tear his heart out myself!"
"115740052-0-1818";"Cease your prattling, warlock. I have not forgotten your part in my resurrection, but you must not forget my power."
"115740052-0-1819";"The city is ours. No army stands a chance against my werewolves."
"115740052-0-1825";"The Fellwatch is a menace. Someone should do something about them."
"115740052-0-1850";"Clear to the east?"
"115740052-0-1851";"No enemies to the north."
"115740052-0-1852";"All goes well?"
"115740052-0-1853";"Easy. Banaril will help."
"115740052-0-1854";"They argue still?"
"115740052-0-1855";"Nothing to report."
"115740052-0-1856";"No Maormer, at any rate,"
"115740052-0-1857";"Yes. Stop bothering me."
"115740052-0-1858";"I can still perform my duty."
"115740052-0-1859";"Do they ever cease?"
"115740052-0-1893";"Be careful!  Stay back... oh, please don't hurt her..."
"115740052-0-1903";"Ebonheart Flag Recovered!"
"115740052-0-1904";"Aldmeri Flag Recovered!"
"115740052-0-1908";"At last, the outsider who rallies my knights to rebellion! I'm going to enjoy this!"
"115740052-0-1911";"It's over. I'm doomed..."
"115740052-0-1917";"Good day, I've come to buy...what do you mean, I have no credit with you? I...see. Well. Perhaps another day."
"115740052-0-1924";"Good day, I've come to buy...I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a bother, but I just thought...I see."
"115740052-0-1925";"I've just been to the shops...again. We cannot buy anything! How can I feed the children?"
"115740052-0-1926";"I know it's difficult, but I'm doing the best that I can."
"115740052-0-1927";"Your best does not put food on the table, or clothes on our backs. I'm so ashamed. Everyone is talking about us."
"115740052-0-1928";"I don't care what everyone is saying, I am doing what I can. What would you have me do? Steal?"
"115740052-0-1929";"No...no...it's just that.... Never mind. I'll make do."
"115740052-0-1960";"Get off my ship!"
"115740052-0-1961";"You'll not steal my treasure!"
"115740052-0-1962";"I'll take my revenge on you!"
"115740052-0-1969";"You do not belong here, mortal. Turn back!"
"115740052-0-1973";"Othrenis will tolerate your presence... briefly. Be swift, stranger."
"115740052-0-1977";"I heard there's treasure out by those old ruins, but it's guarded by spirits."
"115740052-0-1978";"That damn fool noble's going to get himself killed. Fishing out by those harpy nests? What's he thinking?"
"115740052-0-1979";"Someone saw Red Rooks out by the docks. Lousy thieves. Hope they haven't stolen anything from the Mill."
"115740052-0-1980";"I've heard sounds of a battle out by Westtry, but there's no one to be seen. It's the work of spirits, or worse."
"115740052-0-1981";"There's trouble in the air. Dark times are coming. I can tell."
"115740052-0-1982";"Have you heard? The Aldmeri Dominion is pushing back against the Imperial forces in Valenwood. I hope the war doesn't come to High Rock. We've had enough troubles."
"115740052-0-1983";"I've heard that the Ebonheart Pact is lead by a man named Joruun. Seems unlikely that anyone can get the Dunmer and Argonians to stop killing each other for very long."
"115740052-0-1984";"I don't know if there's another culture in Tamriel that can match the military might of the Redguards."
"115740052-0-1985";"What happened to Emperor Varen? I thought he was supposed to unify all of Tamriel under his banner. We don't seem that unified to me."
"115740052-0-1990";"Hm. Well, I heard the Mages' Guild is looking for old artifacts, Maybe they'd have some luck searching that old cave on the coast near Daenia."
"115740052-0-1991";"Have you noticed the horrific stench coming off the Tarn? It's enough to make Aldcroft unlivable. Alchemist Thetis is looking into it."
"115740052-0-1992";"Personally, I've been worried that the Aldmeri Dominion might attack us. I hope Daggerfall Tower can keep us safe."
"115740052-0-1993";"Have you heard? Aldcroft's been flooded with refugees from Camlorn. They say werewolves drove them from their homes."
"115740052-0-1994";"Something strange has been happening in Cyrodiil.They're executing prisoners in the Imperial City. Lots of them."
"115740052-0-1995";"There's an envoy from the Aldmeri Dominion that claims they just want to restore order, but I don't believe that for a second. Bretons were once enslaved by elves. It won't happen again."
"115740052-0-1996";"The Ebonheart Pact is the real threat. The Dunmer can't be trusted, the Nords are barbarians, and the Argonians worship trees."
"115740052-0-1997";"Something terrible happened when Emperor Varen disappeared. I can feel it in my bones."
"115740052-0-1998";"The only - and I mean only - chance for peace in Tamriel is a Breton Emperor."
"115740052-0-1999";"I know we're supposed to be allied with Orsinium... but it's only a matter of time before that falls apart."

"115740052-0-2015";"05 - Goodbye."
"115740052-0-2016";"06 - Best of luck."
"115740052-0-2017";"07 - Safe travels."

"115740052-0-2031";"Ow! Damn bugs."
"115740052-0-2032";"N'wah! You'll die like the rest!"
"115740052-0-2054";"Thank you so much! I'm never leaving Reywell again!"
"115740052-0-2075";"Noticed? They're sleep walking with their eyes open."
"115740052-0-2081";"I know what you're planning, Your Grace."
"115740052-0-2083";"What are you doing here? Leave my room at once!"
"115740052-0-2084";"I won't allow Alcaire to fall into Redguard hands."
"115740052-0-2085";"Alcaire in Redguard hands? Tears of Zeht! You've gone mad!"
"115740052-0-2086";"I'm sorry, but this is the only way."
"115740052-0-2087";"No! Please!"
"115740052-0-2088";"I'm sorry, I can go no farther than the conclave's borders with you.  If you wish to find me again, speak to the Wise Woman."
"115740052-0-2089";"My initiate will accompany you on your trial.  She will not interfere but will witness your success... or bring back your corpse."
"115740052-0-2093";"Pray hard, outlander!  Hope that your status as Blightbane holds true!"
"115740052-0-2094";"That was amazing!  I've never seen anyone fight like that, whether or not they have Meridia's blessing... which it seems that you do, my friend."
"115740052-0-2097";"weeps softly to herself."
"115740052-0-2098";"sputters and comes to life, filling the air with choking red dust."
"115740052-0-2099";"No! Help!"
"115740052-0-2100";"Thank you, <<1>>. I will stay here until I am ready to travel. Please... speak to the hunter Thistlewhip."
"115740052-0-2101";"Tamriel needs a strong Emperor. Preferably a Breton."
"115740052-0-2102";"An Altmer may have founded the Mages' Guild, but it's clear that Bretons are some of the greatest mages in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-2103";"I'm glad the Orcs are on our side. Someone's got to keep the Nords at bay."
"115740052-0-2104";"Redguards are so distrustful of the Mages Guild. I wonder if magic is what drove them from Yokuda?"
"115740052-0-2105";"I've heard that Orc craftsmen produce some of the finest weapons and armor in the Covenant."
"115740052-0-2106";"Oh no. No!"
"115740052-0-2107";"This is taking too long. I think I'm lost again. I better go back to where I was before..."
"115740052-0-2108";"Have you been to the trading house in Wayrest? All kinds of things for sale there."
"115740052-0-2109";"Anyone can join the Mages Guild. The guild needs more than just spellcasters."
"115740052-0-2110";"The Fighters Guild is dedicated to keeping the peace in Tamriel. Well, for a price. They're always looking for new members."
"115740052-0-2111";"Everyone knows that there's a Thieves Guild in every major city, but you have to know where to find them."
"115740052-0-2112";"If I were you, I'd steer clear of the Dark Brotherhood. Thieves are one thing, but the Dark Brotherhood traffics in murder."
"115740052-0-2133";"I need a real cure! Damn you and your lies!"
"115740052-0-2134";"You're hiding the cure from us! I know it!"
"115740052-0-2135";"Hey <<1>>!  Wait, I want to talk to you."
"115740052-0-2136";"Someone in Crosswich asked me collect fifteen ocelot spleens for an ocelot spleen flambe. So, I killed him. Probably did him a favor. He was clearly posessed by Sheogorath."
"115740052-0-2137";"Everyone knows that Bretons make the best mages, hands down. It's not just part of our culture, it's in our blood."
"115740052-0-2138";"It's been a while since anyone but the Redguards have explored the deep desert where the Dwemer once lived. Do they know what's out there, under the sand?"
"115740052-0-2139";"Did you know that the orcs claim the ruins around Orsinium were built by their ancestors? They look Elven to me."
"115740052-0-2140";"You know, the Redguards may be brilliant tacticians, but the Daggerfall Covenant runs on Breton gold."
"115740052-0-2141";"Everyone has to make money somehow."
"115740052-0-2142";"Hm. Well, I'm going to the battlemaster in Wayrest to join the fight against the Dominion and the Pact."
"115740052-0-2143";"I've been thinking of joining the Mages Guild. I know a little about magic."
"115740052-0-2144";"Is that so? Good to know."
"115740052-0-2145";"I've heard the Fighters Guild will hire anyone who can hold a blade or cast a spell."
"115740052-0-2147";"You found it. Thank you. Please, take the locket to my wife. I think I can rest now..."
"115740052-0-2149";"Someone said you could tell me who's getting kickbacks from Sugar.  Good gold in my hand, right here, if you give me a name."
"115740052-0-2150";"I'll take your gold but truth is I don't know.  Sugar's paid off half the dock officers on the Stonefalls coast but from what I hear your crew is an honest one.  More's the pity."
"115740052-0-2152";"It's someone on my crew.  I'll find out one way or another, meanwhile, take this for your trouble."
"115740052-0-2153";"We are doomed..."
"115740052-0-2154";"Why did this happen?"
"115740052-0-2157";"Who are you?  Why are you following me?  Mind your own business or we'll have trouble."
"115740052-0-2159";"deflates and stops squirming."
"115740052-0-2160";"Hey! You there!"
"115740052-0-2161";"bows his head in thanks to you."
"115740052-0-2163";"S'wit! Do you think your meddling will stop us? The Blight will engulf you all!"
"115740052-0-2164";"I am ready for you, Lord Gette. I am yours to command. Do as you will."
"115740052-0-2165";"Make it stop! Make it stop! Make it stop!"
"115740052-0-2166";"I... I'm free!"
"115740052-0-2167";"Come hither, fair maiden."
"115740052-0-2168";"Stop!  Enough!  I thought I could get rid of you but I see it's not the case... listen to me - let's talk about this."
"115740052-0-2169";"Stop meddling in affairs that don't concern you!  Stop investigating or you'll regret it!"

"115740052-0-2199";"Esteemed Father, may I introduce <<1>>."
"115740052-0-2200";"Hissss. Chik-chitter!"
"115740052-0-2202";"Back off. This here's Maleron's private tent."
"115740052-0-2203";"You're not welcome back here. Shove off."
"115740052-0-2204";"You shouldn't be snooping around. You might get hurt."
"115740052-0-2205";"screeches in rage as the nest is destroyed!"
"115740052-0-2207";"I offer you my deepest thanks. Please accept this humble blessing as a gift."
"115740052-0-2212";"Psst! Meet me at the southwest edge of the docks."
"115740052-0-2216";"Do you imagine you can just walk away after killing my pets? I think not."
"115740052-0-2217";"I don't want to go back. Divines help me!"
"115740052-0-2218";"Help me, please! They're going to burn me alive!"
"115740052-0-2219";"There are... too many. Need to take... a rest...."
"115740052-0-2222";"Who dares to wrest me from my grave?"
"115740052-0-2224";"This witch burns... and so will you!"
"115740052-0-2227";"What are you doing?  Thief!"
"115740052-0-2228";"There! I see a Bosmer hunting camp!"
"115740052-0-2230";"I hope my son hasn't sent another fool to dig up my grave."
"115740052-0-2243";"Dig! Dig I say! Dig for the Bones...."
"115740052-0-2249";"This one's hide is mine!"
"115740052-0-2250";"Eat, mortal! Eat the Bones...."
"115740052-0-2251";"Down! Get down here now!"
"115740052-0-2252";"Now... Die!"
"115740052-0-2253";"This one will make a fine coat for my wife."
"115740052-0-2254";"This one looks delicious."
"115740052-0-2255";"Ah, fresh prey."
"115740052-0-2256";"cackles wildly."
"115740052-0-2258";"We'll see who gets hurt!"
"115740052-0-2259";"I'm sorry. I can't go on...."
"115740052-0-2268";"What? Quarantine? You'd lock me up after all we went through at Fort Arand? I served House Redoran loyally for years. Now you throw me in a pen?"
"115740052-0-2269";"I don't care if you're Akatosh himself. You might become sick. You could poison others. I have no choice. Guard!"
"115740052-0-2270";"Don't insult me with an armed escort from my own brother-in-arms. I'll go."
"115740052-0-2274";"Thank you. Now that I've received the blessings of the Three, I will leave my fate in their hands."

"115740052-0-2293";"Stop!  You've made your point!  I'd rather survive and see this place succeed than let you waste my blood here.  I'll do as you ask.  Now get out of my inn!"
"115740052-0-2295";"Ah, that's the herb I need."
"115740052-0-2296";"Damn it. I need more of that herb."

"115740052-0-2302";"Who dares to raise the flag of challenge?"
"115740052-0-2304";"Ha! We have you now, skooma peddler!"
"115740052-0-2310";"Don't try to run. I'll cut you down!"
"115740052-0-2311";"Your days of selling skooma are over."

"115740052-0-2320";"Ah, well. I didn't like that guy much anyway."
"115740052-0-2321";"Let 'em run. We'll get our money... one way or another."
"115740052-0-2324";"Who are you? How dare you disrupt my business!"
"115740052-0-2325";"This is not the way to Aldcroft. I'll take my chances and run there myself."
"115740052-0-2326";"We made it to Aldcroft. May the eight praise you!"
"115740052-0-2327";"appears and throws itself at you."
"115740052-0-2328";"This is one mistake you won't make again."
"115740052-0-2329";"You aren't one of mine. Imposter!"
"115740052-0-2330";"I'll be right - urp! - back."
"115740052-0-2334";"Run, little pest, run!"
"115740052-0-2340";"We shouldn't go this far. We need to train along the road leading to the siege camp north of Aldcroft."
"115740052-0-2342";"This is too far for me. I'll meet with you when you return, but for now, I'll stay in Aldcroft."
"115740052-0-2348";"I have learned so much! I'm going to run to the siege camp. Head over when you're ready."
"115740052-0-2354";"You defy me?"

"115740052-0-2359";"Ah! I hate being this weak!"
"115740052-0-2370";"Aldcroft is the other way, traveller."
"115740052-0-2371";"I didn't fall down this time. Can we talk?"
"115740052-0-2372";"Kill her! Kill the witch!"
"115740052-0-2373";"You leave me no choice. Your lives are now forfeit."
"115740052-0-2374";"Come closer, <<1>>. I have been expecting you."
"115740052-0-2375";"Then some fool attacked me and got the ring."
"115740052-0-2376";"That ring was powerful, but it wasn't necessary for Angof's plans."
"115740052-0-2377";"Do you even know what Angof's plans are?"
"115740052-0-2378";"He's plotting the downfall of the Covenant. Our part is imbuing the corpses you bring us with something... unspeakable. It kills the living, rasies them from the dead, and makes them subservient to his will."
"115740052-0-2379";"That would explain those wolves. Those things give me the shivers! They're just like Faolchu and his army in Camlorn."
"115740052-0-2380";"Yes, the wolves are like him, but nowhere near as powerful... or corrupt."
"115740052-0-2381";"I'll just be glad when this job is done."
"115740052-0-2382";"Of course you will."
"115740052-0-2383";"I don't know, Adrisu. These Lion Guard lackeys were more trouble than we expect."
"115740052-0-2384";"True enough. The Covenant still has some life, after all. They had to lose a city before they realized it."
"115740052-0-2385";"If they keep getting supplies run in through Aldcroft, we're going to have a hard time finishing this."
"115740052-0-2386";"That's why we need those corpses. People can't live without fresh water, Didier. As soon as they drink from the tarn, we'll have exactly what we need."
"115740052-0-2387";"You know what we really need? We need is to get this over with! The money only goes so far towards keeping my sanity."
"115740052-0-2388";"Angof's doing something up at Cath Bedraud. Is it worse than what's going on here?"
"115740052-0-2389";"I don't know what you mean by that. How could it be worse? He's doing the work of our master."
"115740052-0-2390";"I heard he's raising an army in the name of Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-2391";"""Raising?"" What an interesting choice of words. Yes, his army will sweep over this land, erasing what little remains of the Covenant. Soon, Daggerfall will be a memory."
"115740052-0-2392";"That's fine by me, Adrisu. After Angof pays us, we can find plenty of other places to spend his money."
"115740052-0-2393";"In the ancient heart of Valenwood, evil stirs among the shadows. The mysterious Bosmer sorceress Selene has led her tribe here, away from the ravages of the Camoran Civil War, to raise a new army."
"115740052-0-2395";"Pssst!  Let me out!  Let me out I say!  Help!  Let me out of this bottle!"
"115740052-0-2403";"Goodbye.  Thank you for your help!"
"115740052-0-2404";"<<1>>, I implore you to help my brothers face the Alessians. If they overrun our camp, we will never find the thief."
"115740052-0-2405";"The Alessian advance falters. My past self is in the Alessian Camp. Speak to me. For me, it will be the first time we ever meet."
"115740052-0-2406";"Raven's echo has given us the clue we need. Return to me, <<1>>, so we may speak further."
"115740052-0-2407";"Ah, you're a beautiful one. Bleed for me!"
"115740052-0-2408";"I want to feel my blade inside you!"

"115740052-0-2410";"Hello, my pretty. Looking forward to tonight?"
"115740052-0-2411";"I look forward to shaking the breath from your tiny throat."
"115740052-0-2412";"Ha ha! Oh, my pretty, you have such intriguing ideas!"
"115740052-0-2414";"Look who it is? The samaritan who took my ring. I think I'd like that back now!"
"115740052-0-2415";"Oh, having second thoughts about the ring? Well, sorry to disappoint but someone took it from me, probably some you sent!"
"115740052-0-2416";"I don't know who you are, or how you got here, but it is the last mistake you're likely to make."
"115740052-0-2418";"I can't wait to get home to my family. Thank you for helping me."
"115740052-0-2419";"I'm glad to be away from that place. I still feel sick from the torture."
"115740052-0-2420";"Please hold a moment. I'm afraid I still feel the effects of what they did to me."
"115740052-0-2421";"Please, no. Someone help me!"
"115740052-0-2427";"Drink. Drink, and be mighty!"
"115740052-0-2428";"Go forth and destroy our enemies!"
"115740052-0-2429";"Thank you for your help, <<1>>; we weren't sure we were getting out of that one alive!"

"115740052-0-2452";"You're here to take our rum, aren't you?  Not if I have anything to say about it!"
"115740052-0-2456";"Brothers! Where are you? Why do you not answer my calls?"
"115740052-0-2457";"What are you doing?!  Stop!"
"115740052-0-2485";"I've got to report my findings to my superiors. This information could cripple our enemies."
"115740052-0-2486";"Did you hear that? I thought I heard a noise."
"115740052-0-2489";"What is this vision I see?"
"115740052-0-2495";"No! You cannot take that! Hircine, my lord, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-2496";"I shall find you again soon, mortal!"
"115740052-0-2503";"What a terrible dream! Er... what am I doing out here?"
"115740052-0-2504";"No... no! Keep them away!"

"115740052-0-2524";"We are overrun, heroes! Help, quickly!"
"115740052-0-2525";"I'm free. Now to get out of here. But there's one more thing …."
"115740052-0-2526";"They have broken through! Master Gemin, I am... sorry..."
"115740052-0-2531";"reels in a Blue Mackerel."

"115740052-0-2550";"Praise Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-2551";"It is done."
"115740052-0-2552";"Help me!"
"115740052-0-2553";"Help! Please!"
"115740052-0-2554";"Dog!"
"115740052-0-2555";"Idiot!"
"115740052-0-2556";"You stink."
"115740052-0-2557";"Not very bright, are you?"
"115740052-0-2558";"Stand away, or you'll be sorry."
"115740052-0-2559";"I will bathe in your blood!"
"115740052-0-2560";"You want a beating?"
"115740052-0-2561";"Prepare to die."
"115740052-0-2562";"Confound it!"
"115740052-0-2563";"Oh bother!"
"115740052-0-2564";"Oof!"
"115740052-0-2565";"Ow!"

"115740052-0-2569";"What?"
"115740052-0-2570";"What's this?"
"115740052-0-2571";"Howling Harpies!"
"115740052-0-2573";"Kill that one!"
"115740052-0-2575";"Kill!"
"115740052-0-2578";"Rest. I need rest."
"115740052-0-2580";"Aye."
"115740052-0-2581";"Yes."
"115740052-0-2582";"Surely."
"115740052-0-2583";"No."
"115740052-0-2584";"Nay."
"115740052-0-2585";"I think not."
"115740052-0-2586";"Ho there."
"115740052-0-2587";"Hello."
"115740052-0-2591";"Puny mortal - defeat and death lies before you!"

"115740052-0-2613";"That's all for you!"
"115740052-0-2614";"Glorious!"
"115740052-0-2623";"I'll take that."
"115740052-0-2624";"This will do."
"115740052-0-2625";"I have it."
"115740052-0-2626";"Here we are."
"115740052-0-2627";"Greetings."

"115740052-0-2635";"I need your help."
"115740052-0-2636";"If I may ask a favor."
"115740052-0-2637";"Can you help me, friend?"
"115740052-0-2638";"If you would."
"115740052-0-2639";"A qucik favor?"
"115740052-0-2640";"I've a favor to ask you."
"115740052-0-2641";"Understood."
"115740052-0-2642";"Very well."
"115740052-0-2643";"As you say."
"115740052-0-2644";"It will be done."
"115740052-0-2645";"I obey."
"115740052-0-2646";"At once."
"115740052-0-2647";"Wait."
"115740052-0-2648";"Wait a moment."
"115740052-0-2649";"Don't make me trounce you."
"115740052-0-2650";"I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-2651";"Of all the... blast!"
"115740052-0-2652";"Here, take this."
"115740052-0-2653";"Take it."
"115740052-0-2654";"I'll wait here."
"115740052-0-2655";"Here I stay."
"115740052-0-2656";"This won't do."
"115740052-0-2657";"Try again."
"115740052-0-2658";"You'll have to do better than that."
"115740052-0-2659";"Well done."
"115740052-0-2660";"Very good."
"115740052-0-2661";"That will do."
"115740052-0-2662";"That will do."
"115740052-0-2663";"Stop thief!"
"115740052-0-2664";"Thief! Thief!"
"115740052-0-2665";"Help! Murder!"
"115740052-0-2666";"Murderer! Stop!"
"115740052-0-2668";"Merciful Aedra!"
"115740052-0-2669";"Great Reman's ghost!"
"115740052-0-2670";"Do you challenge my authority here? Duel me!"
"115740052-0-2679";"Ha! I told you my kin would rescue me!"
"115740052-0-2680";"Ha! You're the worst abductor I've ever had!"
"115740052-0-2682";"gallops into the enclosure."
"115740052-0-2689";"staggers. The shield around it seems to weaken."
"115740052-0-2690";"We must speak. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-2691";"Please hurry!"
"115740052-0-2692";"Ha! Foolish <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-2693";"hears terrified cries coming from the nearby thicket."
"115740052-0-2697";"Thanks! I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-2699";"You down there. Come up out of the tomb. We have important matters to discuss."
"115740052-0-2701";"dies down."
"115740052-0-2705";"Stay!"
"115740052-0-2721";"whickers anxiously as it leaves its familiar surroundings. It stops following."
"115740052-0-2722";"Please stay close to me. I'm afraid to go on alone."
"115740052-0-2727";"Please stay close. I can't make it alone!"
"115740052-0-2733";"points at the skull."
"115740052-0-2734";"points at the ribs."
"115740052-0-2735";"points at the spine."
"115740052-0-2736";"points at the pile of bones."
"115740052-0-2737";"uses a Scroll of Recall."
"115740052-0-2743";"grunts with surprise and runs off."
"115740052-0-2757";"I'm ready. I'm coming."
"115740052-0-2789";"gasps her last breath."
"115740052-0-2803";"Ooh, nice find!"
"115740052-0-2804";"Hey, I was going to take that! Give it to me!"
"115740052-0-2805";"You! Get off my beach, Dominioner dog!"
"115740052-0-2829";"This is a pleasant surprise. The cause of so many headaches is here!"
"115740052-0-2830";"My pets will make short work of you!"
"115740052-0-2831";"Abandon ship!"
"115740052-0-2832";"The ship's on fire!"
"115740052-0-2833";"Flee for your lives!"
"115740052-0-2834";"Swim to shore!"
"115740052-0-2839";"I will destroy you myself!"
"115740052-0-2840";"You haven't stopped me, mortal."
"115740052-0-2868";"Help! <<1>>'s an Imperial! Hic!"
"115740052-0-2869";"Twice betrayed, the children of Veloth await his return within the shadow of the mountain."
"115740052-0-2870";"The Three stole Lorkhan's blessing, but he freely gives it to the one who guards our lord!"
"115740052-0-2871";"The lost house sleeps, yet he sings to us of days when he'll clear the land of our foes!"
"115740052-0-2872";"The n'wah and the false shall be razed from our lands. We will bask in the glory of Lorkhan's vessel!"
"115740052-0-2882";"We have no time to lose. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-2883";"Your form is weak, but my children will transform into beautiful creatures. We will rebuild the Chimer Empire!"
"115740052-0-2884";"We will make sacrifices. Nerevar will not have died in vain!"
"115740052-0-2885";"Three traitors fell upon our champion, yet they demand fealty?"
"115740052-0-2886";"Who is this mortal who dares to awakens me? You toy with the will of a god... and I am his chosen vessel!"
"115740052-0-2887";"Our god... lives!"
"115740052-0-2891";"How strange. I believe this tea has gone stale."
"115740052-0-2906";"hears a loud explosion from the House Hlaalu base camp."
"115740052-0-2910";"is placed, armed, and ready!"
"115740052-0-2911";"Is it clear? I'm coming out."
"115740052-0-2912";"You are an intruder here! Get out!"
"115740052-0-2913";"Crelie? I see you're still trying to aid Marcel. How ... kind of you."
"115740052-0-2914";"Give me a moment to unseal the door."
"115740052-0-2915";"Sorry, friend. You know too much."
"115740052-0-2916";"You dare destroy one of my servants? I will not be stopped so easily!"
"115740052-0-2917";"This tears at my soul! We must destroy it!"
"115740052-0-2918";"Ah, another recruit comes calling. We always welcome more help for defending the Codex. Ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-2919";"Now you shall feel death's embrace!"
"115740052-0-2920";"I will drain you before another Maruhkite falls!"
"115740052-0-2921";"No! The ward fades. My power... is gone."
"115740052-0-2922";"awakens one of its brethren!"
"115740052-0-2923";"Quick! Run and hide!"
"115740052-0-2924";"Now teeth come in the dark! Aieee!"
"115740052-0-2925";"Don't stick up! Run away!"
"115740052-0-2926";"Raw meat, raw meat! Aieee!"
"115740052-0-2927";"No, no, the sky is too far! A place of greater safety!"
"115740052-0-2928";"My son was a traitor to his family and his people. He knew the time would come when he'd have to pay."
"115740052-0-2929";"No! I'd never kill my son. This must be a nightmare!"
"115740052-0-2930";"Once again, I'm in control... and now, I'll add your body to the pile of corpses!"
"115740052-0-2943";"What is this treachery?"
"115740052-0-2944";"Our master will avenge us!"
"115740052-0-2945";"hears something rustling in the bushes at the base of the tree."
"115740052-0-2947";"The intruders are here! Withdraw to the archives!"
"115740052-0-2948";"Enough! The trial is over."
"115740052-0-2949";"has entered Blightwater falls, and can use Carelleth's Potion."
"115740052-0-2950";"has left Blightwater falls, and can no longer use Carelleth's Potion."
"115740052-0-2951";"So it's true then - we're trapped down here."
"115740052-0-2952";"Yes. These beds will be our final resting place."
"115740052-0-2953";"So be it. At least the Archives will be safe. Our lives are meaningless next to the secrets held within."
"115740052-0-2954";"breaks when you pick it up. Only a kwama worker could safely collect this egg."
"115740052-0-2955";"takes the egg and carries it back towards the queen."
"115740052-0-2956";"No one lives! No one leaves!"
"115740052-0-2957";"You cannot stop the Seeker!"
"115740052-0-2961";"begins to follow you."
"115740052-0-2962";"No! I won't let you hurt my family!"
"115740052-0-2963";"Hold a moment, friend. You are not an easy one to find."
"115740052-0-2969";"Alessia, grant me strength!"
"115740052-0-2974";"This cannot be..."
"115740052-0-2975";"Who dares enter the Archives!?"
"115740052-0-2982";"The codex is once again safe."
"115740052-0-2986";"Excellent. You have the stone. Proceed, mortal, and come to my shrine."
"115740052-0-2987";"At last! Fresh air! My thanks to you, friend."
"115740052-0-2988";"Yes. This dust will return the light to my shrine. Bring this and the stone when you come to my shrine."
"115740052-0-2990";"Sounds good. This place is a bit too damp for my liking."
"115740052-0-2991";"Begin the ritual! We must seal the archives!"
"115740052-0-2996";"What magic is this? Show yourself, fiend! Guards, attend!"
"115740052-0-2998";"Who trespasses in our refuge? Have you neither reverence nor fear?"
"115740052-0-2999";"I wasn't expecting to see you here. Where's Falena?"
"115740052-0-3000";"What's the meaning of this? Are you mad?"
"115740052-0-3001";"I don't want to fight you, friend! I don't know what demons control you, but I will leave you to them."
"115740052-0-3010";"Psst! Hey, you! Come here."
"115740052-0-3018";"When Galthis rules Stormhaven, I will return for Sir Hughes!"
"115740052-0-3019";"When Galthis is king, Hosni At-Tura will not elude me again."
"115740052-0-3020";"When the Night Terror has seized Stormhaven, General Godrun will obey me again!"
"115740052-0-3033";"Vaermina warned me you would come. You will die here … and in your world!"
"115740052-0-3034";"After you're dead, I will return and assume your King Emeric's form."
"115740052-0-3035";"When I awaken as Emeric, I will tell everyone of your sacrifice within the dream to save my life."
"115740052-0-3046";"Attention!  A brave soul approaches the arena!"
"115740052-0-3047";"It costs 1 gold to enter!"
"115740052-0-3048";"Looks like Dalomer's been hitting the bottle again."
"115740052-0-3051";"You should have never attempted to sneak into our lair, fool! This mistake will be your last."
"115740052-0-3057";"I was right about you. You are a fool to attempt to slay one such as myself!"
"115740052-0-3067";"We shall destroy these beasts together. Stand your ground!"
"115740052-0-3068";"Impressive, but it shall not be enough!"
"115740052-0-3069";"Enough of this!"
"115740052-0-3075";"pulls the lever, opening a nearby gate."
"115740052-0-3076";"If that filthy cur has anything to say, he can say it to someone else. I'm tired of the sound of his voice."
"115740052-0-3077";"I understand, Brelayne. If you can forgive me for one day, I would be... grateful."
"115740052-0-3078";"Brelayne, I know I don't deserve your respect, but give me this moment as an act of charity."
"115740052-0-3082";"I've wasted enough time treating with you."
"115740052-0-3083";"Well? Speak quickly."
"115740052-0-3084";"It appears I've wasted my time. Leave, then."
"115740052-0-3087";"Speak to me when you're ready to leave. I'll get us out of here safely."
"115740052-0-3088";"This one can be killed."
"115740052-0-3099";"Your soul is rich with power."
"115740052-0-3100";"A pity I must leave your vessel, mortal. You'll see you have no lasting damage. Go in peace."
"115740052-0-3101";"The untouched soul is sweet. Quite... warm."
"115740052-0-3102";"I will wrap myself around your soul, but only for a moment, mortal."
"115740052-0-3108";"Brothers, the ritual is complete: The archives are sealed. Now on to final death at the hands of our enemies. For Alessia!"
"115740052-0-3109";"You're mad if you think I'm heading into the cultist's lair. I'll wait right here until you get back."
"115740052-0-3110";"House Indoril will fall! The Daedra will tear Aldsotha apart!"
"115740052-0-3111";"When Aldsotha falls, House Dres will rise to claim it!"
"115740052-0-3138";"Should I... follow?"
"115740052-0-3139";"Too tired. I'll just sleep here...."
"115740052-0-3143";"Did you come bearing gifts, my friend?"
"115740052-0-3144";"Splendid! Please take a seat, young lad."
"115740052-0-3145";"What... where am I?"
"115740052-0-3146";"Why have these men brought us here? What do they want?"
"115740052-0-3147";"The Maruhkites are monsters masquerading as men. They brought us here only to do ill."
"115740052-0-3148";"Then... I pray the end comes quickly."
"115740052-0-3149";"Betrayed! So cold. I must feed...."
"115740052-0-3150";"You're not one of them, but their stench lingers on your flesh. Interesting. Please, come speak to me."
"115740052-0-3152";"I trust you won't make this too dull."
"115740052-0-3153";"This one needs more bones, Lord Aurignae. More bones to finish the tower."
"115740052-0-3154";"Yes. That is justice. Seeing that was almost worth dying for...."
"115740052-0-3155";"You expect me to pull soldiers off the line to dig them out of the barrow?"
"115740052-0-3156";"My work is off-schedule. Kvata vako! Unacceptable!"
"115740052-0-3157";"Do not raise your voice to me, necromancer. Finish the device, then I shall pay you."
"115740052-0-3159";"rises from the vents."
"115740052-0-3160";"Go to your rest, my brethren. Awaken when the faithful return, so that we may test their might."
"115740052-0-3162";"The undead are here! They're attacking the Sylvan Mines! Ready your weapons!"
"115740052-0-3163";"Garghalgahakllg!"
"115740052-0-3164";"Another assassin? Another fool for me to kill."
"115740052-0-3165";"We have trouble! The undead of the Rivergraves are heading this way! Something horrible is leading them. We don't have time to get everyone out. They'll be on us in minutes!"
"115740052-0-3166";"I didn't think I could be bested by someone like you. If you have any pity, make your blow swift."
"115740052-0-3167";"May the Tribunal help us all. Get out there! Get us any help you can gather. We'll stand and fight!"
"115740052-0-3168";"swallows the package whole."
"115740052-0-3171";"The fight is about to begin! All bettors to the stands!"
"115740052-0-3174";"Stop! How dare you steal from the Maruhkites!"
"115740052-0-3175";"What a fight! Come collect your winnings, or place a bet on the next match!"
"115740052-0-3177";"sniffs around, looking for the source of the smell."
"115740052-0-3181";"She's on her own, then. I won't take a fall for her!"
"115740052-0-3182";"She's got a lot to answer for!"
"115740052-0-3183";"is frightened by the scent of your nix-hound boots."
"115740052-0-3184";"Open this door right now, or I'll batter it down!"
"115740052-0-3185";"is free. It begins to follow you."
"115740052-0-3186";"falls over, slightly intoxicated."
"115740052-0-3187";"Wait for me out here."
"115740052-0-3188";"All right, let's go."
"115740052-0-3189";"sets the dry branch on fire."
"115740052-0-3190";"catches ablaze from the nearby fire, burning off the poison."
"115740052-0-3191";"oozes a poisonous mist when its petals are cut."
"115740052-0-3192";"We have a new challenger!  <<1>> has travelled here to fight for the title of Champion.  Stand and salute those that are about to die!"
"115740052-0-3196";"Ah! Get it off!"
"115740052-0-3197";"What happened?"
"115740052-0-3201";"Enough talk. We don't need you around here!"
"115740052-0-3206";"Lets see how <<1>> can handle the fighting dwarves!"
"115740052-0-3207";"Lets see how <<1>> can handle the fierce arena lions!"
"115740052-0-3208";"Lets see how <<1>> can handle the MUTATED BEAST!"
"115740052-0-3209";"This is the event we all have been waiting for!  Lets see how <<1>> can handle the Champion of the Bloodfields!"
"115740052-0-3211";"All Hail <<1>>  the Champion of the Bloodfields!"
"115740052-0-3215";"What's happening? Quickly, get Anahsu! Hold on, friend. Help is on the way."
"115740052-0-3216";"Someone help! Anahsu has collapsed!"
"115740052-0-3217";"That's too bad. I was just beginning to like you."
"115740052-0-3218";"And so you've come to die! I gave you your chance, but now the Mabrigash will do with you as we please."
"115740052-0-3219";"is being stalked by a hungry hoarvor!"
"115740052-0-3224";"This vessel is far too weak to defeat you. Interesting."
"115740052-0-3225";"I don't feel well. We should get back to the camp as soon as possible."
"115740052-0-3230";"You're no dream spirit—you're real. Can you help me?"
"115740052-0-3231";"Those betrayers, the outlaws—they haunt my dream."
"115740052-0-3235";"oozes with a strong aroma."
"115740052-0-3236";"Leave the barrow. This one is too busy overseeing the undead to bother with you."
"115740052-0-3241";"Mehna, you can't hold me here any longer. I'm leaving!"
"115740052-0-3242";"Cur! Did you think I'd let this insult stand? You will rue this day. I promise you!"
"115740052-0-3247";"Your end comes now!"
"115740052-0-3254";"An intruder? I shouldn't have trusted House Dunmer!"
"115740052-0-3255";"I know nothing about this. I thought you said this place was safe!"
"115740052-0-3256";"The Vereansu will prevail! House Dunmer will fall!"
"115740052-0-3267";"falls to pieces! Tiny lizards scatter, seeking a place to hide!"
"115740052-0-3268";"Ha ha! Hold. Hold! You beat me."
"115740052-0-3278";"Soon all of the Mabrigash will fall to the will of our Master. You cannot stop us."
"115740052-0-3289";"I see you, spy! You'll die here!"
"115740052-0-3290";"You'll regret that, n'wah!"
"115740052-0-3291";"Intruder!"
"115740052-0-3296";"You think Titanborn's actually here in the city?"
"115740052-0-3298";"What do you mean? What about the bounty?"
"115740052-0-3300";"Gods. That's just ... madness. It can't be true."
"115740052-0-3301";"You there! We're looking for an oversized Nord woman, too big to miss. Have you seen her?"
"115740052-0-3302";"Who, me? I … I don't know. I don't think so."
"115740052-0-3303";"You don't think so? That's not very convincing. Come now, tell me what you know."
"115740052-0-3304";"I don't know anything! Just leave me alone, will you?"
"115740052-0-3305";"I will, this time … but I've got my eye on you."
"115740052-0-3306";"Kill him!"
"115740052-0-3315";"That's my tea, friend. Speaking of tea, it's about time for mine."
"115740052-0-3316";"falls asleep."
"115740052-0-3317";"begins convulsing as the poison takes effect."
"115740052-0-3318";"Ah, there you are. We were beginning to wonder...."
"115740052-0-3319";"Finally, I am whole again. I don't know what I've done to deserve a second chance. \n\nPerhaps I'll return to Mournhold and start a new life. Thank you... friend."
"115740052-0-3320";"What a cruel joke! To live again, further from life than ever before. I think you put more than bones in there."
"115740052-0-3321";"How are you feeling, my friend?"
"115740052-0-3322";"Well enough, Lyris. Well enough. We have the location of the Balac, do we not? And our foretold friend has arrived! The wheel revolves. We cannot ask for more."
"115740052-0-3323";"Must you always speak in riddles, old man?"
"115740052-0-3324";"We abide in the ""Gray Maybe."" What can any of us speak but riddles? If our enemies have their way, there will be no more riddles... only the dead and deadly certainty."
"115740052-0-3325";"He's always like this. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did trying to pull a straight answer out of him."
"115740052-0-3326";"No, no more talk from me. I tire. Lyris, you must apprise our friend of the situation."
"115740052-0-3327";"Ghwahhhhhhhhhhh nughhhhhhhhhhh."
"115740052-0-3328";"You won't live another day, vile creature!"
"115740052-0-3329";"That should be enough to clear the area!"
"115740052-0-3330";"Who desires death? Who would dare enter the arena willingly?"
"115740052-0-3331";"I'll send your soul to the coil. Mortal! Embrace death!"
"115740052-0-3333";"The portal stone is in the next room. I'll quicken it for you."
"115740052-0-3334";"He really believes in you, you know. The Prophet, I mean."
"115740052-0-3335";"I never put much faith in prophecy. Talking about fate and destiny makes it too easy to lose sight of what's real."
"115740052-0-3336";"All I can do is try to keep the old man from losing touch. Keep him from... falling into himself. Some days, he's barely here."
"115740052-0-3337";"I just hope you appreciate the trust we've placed in you."
"115740052-0-3338";"Show yourself! I know you're here!"
"115740052-0-3339";"I didn't expect you to come. Now I'll finally have my revenge!"
"115740052-0-3340";"Is that what you think? Then maybe I should finish what I started...."
"115740052-0-3341";"Quickly, friend! While she's distracted!"
"115740052-0-3342";"You think you can hold me in that petty vessel, mortal? I'll be watching you...."
"115740052-0-3344";"Zombies are creepy."
"115740052-0-3345";"They sure are."
"115740052-0-3346";"This is an ill turn of events. Now our plans must change... somehow."
"115740052-0-3347";"The anchor of the axis is broken... broken, but not destroyed! Here, we have it. And here, we may repair it."
"115740052-0-3348";"Yes! There is still a chance for redemption. A hope, at least. The Balac may be restored, distant pieces... reunited."
"115740052-0-3349";"And this task we shall entrust to you, for who else could do it? Not I. Not this feeble old man... but I could tell you how...."
"115740052-0-3354";"This place holds only death and we added more to it when we came here. But still we found more writing that read, ""What you take from Life will help you face Death."""
"115740052-0-3355";"What the Dwemer made here, we cannot even imagine. But we found a machine that had this written on it, ""The Force of the fire is withstood only by the grip of winter."""
"115740052-0-3356";"Time doesn't touch these halls, frozen as they are. My order fought a huge battle here. Each time one of us fell, they shouted, ""Only Death will let you slip from Winter's Grasp."""
"115740052-0-3365";"Master Vemar, this brave stranger has discovered an insidious plot against our flock!"
"115740052-0-3366";"I am well aware of what this stranger has done. This oversight will soon be rectified."
"115740052-0-3367";"I don't understand what you mean, Diviner."
"115740052-0-3368";"Fool! The faithful will flood from the great temple. House Dres will be the harbinger of a new age!"
"115740052-0-3378";"By the Three! I've been looking for you for days."
"115740052-0-3379";"Pathetic! My clannfear will make quick work of you!"
"115740052-0-3380";"What madness is this? Who dares to defile this sacred place?"
"115740052-0-3381";"Such incompetence! I'll take care of this one myself."
"115740052-0-3383";"You don't belong here!"
"115740052-0-3402";"Don't meddle in our affairs, or you'll suffer, just as the herder did!"
"115740052-0-3403";"What do you think you're doing? That's our food!"
"115740052-0-3405";"Who dares disturb my indoctrination? Vemar will hear of this insult!"
"115740052-0-3406";"You! You will pay for all the mayhem you've caused me. Slay this infidel!"
"115740052-0-3407";"loses interest and runs off on its own."
"115740052-0-3409";"Eight save us. Lakana is dead!"
"115740052-0-3410";"By the gods! They've murdered the duchess!"
"115740052-0-3411";"So does Malacath teach us the value of strength, even as we conquer his minions."
"115740052-0-3412";"Not going. Apeneck finds another way!"
"115740052-0-3413";"collapses to the ground, severely weakened."
"115740052-0-3414";"Thank... you..."
"115740052-0-3415";"You dare to interfere? I will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-3416";"I'm so sorry for this. I... I have no other choice."
"115740052-0-3417";"I knew you were stronger than that. Keep your eyes open. There's more to come."
"115740052-0-3418";"I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I have to do this. I must... for my own life."
"115740052-0-3419";"Did you think death would stop me? My phylactery sustains me!"
"115740052-0-3420";"Hello, are you lost? It's dangerous to go alone!"
"115740052-0-3421";"Enough of this! I need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-3422";"has recovered from its weakened state."
"115740052-0-3423";"gets up and runs off, its rage dissipated."
"115740052-0-3424";"Please, hold for a moment! I beg you!"
"115740052-0-3425";"The door is closed for a reason, s'wit!"
"115740052-0-3426";"Until you've finished the job, there's no way you're getting inside."
"115740052-0-3429";"Through Mournhold's law, the Morag Tong has issued a writ of execution on the one standing before me. That victim now dies."
"115740052-0-3430";"Hey, you look familiar. Do I know you?"
"115740052-0-3431";"Have I seen you in Mournhold?"
"115740052-0-3432";"I could have sworn.... I'm sorry. I'm usually really good with faces!"
"115740052-0-3433";"I don't think so."
"115740052-0-3434";"You're drunk, and I know you're mistaken."
"115740052-0-3435";"Apparently not this time. I must be going."
"115740052-0-3436";"My men are dropping off your supplies as we speak. Four crates of skooma per our agreement, plus the supplement."
"115740052-0-3437";"You need to keep your little rag-tag establishment under better control. We noticed the escaped alits on our way to the drop off. It puts the lives of my men in danger."
"115740052-0-3438";"Well, get more. Those alits have obviously been given the supplement, and your ""haunted forest"" stories won't keep Mournhold authorities out forever."
"115740052-0-3439";"Yes, they are well hidden in the mountain gap. My men will keep an eye on it until they recognize yours have claimed it. Farewell."
"115740052-0-3440";"Stop! Get away from there!"
"115740052-0-3441";"I've grown very fond of our little business arrangement, although I can't say my betting customers would share that sentiment."
"115740052-0-3442";"You House Dunmer worry too much. I have people clearing them out."
"115740052-0-3443";"So I can pick up the shipment in the usual place?"
"115740052-0-3444";"I highly doubt that Mournhold authorities will ever suspect House Dres in connection with a place such as this."
"115740052-0-3445";"So does Molag Bal teach us to be vigilant against the mists of deceit."
"115740052-0-3446";"You look much smarter than the last cretin they threw down here. Perhaps you'll be more amusing."
"115740052-0-3447";"Say hello to the little play-gods in the temple for me!"
"115740052-0-3453";"Your blood shall feed the earth, mortal!"
"115740052-0-3454";"So does Mehrunes Dagon test all Dunmer through trials of war and strife. You have overcome all the trials, as we have since time immemorial. Enter, child, for you are welcome."
"115740052-0-3464";"I'm so sorry...."
"115740052-0-3465";"Galseth? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-3466";"materializes from the mist to bring havoc on her foes."
"115740052-0-3467";"You are not worthy to touch me, n'wah. Unhand me! Return me at once!"
"115740052-0-3468";"If you will not return me, I will haunt your dreams until you are mad with despair. Do not test my patience... or my power."
"115740052-0-3469";"You have done well, mortal. Perhaps we will meet again."
"115740052-0-3470";"You! You will pay for this insult, fetcher!"
"115740052-0-3471";"I see you've finally arrived! You're just in time to marvel at my creations... before I destroy your petty vessel and add it to my army."
"115740052-0-3472";"Did you really think I would fall? I wield power you cannot possibly comprehend!"
"115740052-0-3473";"What is this? You are strong, but I will win this day!"
"115740052-0-3479";"I'll run ahead to check on preparations. Follow me down when you're ready."
"115740052-0-3481";"We made it. I hope Edros will be all right."
"115740052-0-3482";"Away! Get away from here!"
"115740052-0-3483";"Be on your guard! The patriarch knows our plans!"
"115740052-0-3486";"Quickly, strike at the phylactery!"
"115740052-0-3487";"You will not fail me, servant. Arise!"
"115740052-0-3488";"No! This cannot be!"
"115740052-0-3489";"Let us leave this accursed temple. Quickly!"
"115740052-0-3494";"Almalexia preserve me!"
"115740052-0-3499";"Thank you. It's much quieter up here."
"115740052-0-3500";"I can hear it again... like bells in the earth...."
"115740052-0-3501";"This is too real!"
"115740052-0-3502";"I never thought I'd be so happy to see my tent again."
"115740052-0-3509";"Very well. Thank you for your counsel."
"115740052-0-3510";"Then Sir Hughes will have his wish and Lakana will be avenged. Go ahead, Sir Edmund."
"115740052-0-3511";"Rise, old friend. You will not die this day."
"115740052-0-3512";"Forgive me, my old friend."
"115740052-0-3513";"Then my punishment is living in disgrace."
"115740052-0-3514";"One clean blow. Strike swiftly now."
"115740052-0-3517";"catches Maleah's scent and runs off, squeezing through a small gap in the pallisades."
"115740052-0-3518";"faints from the poison of the musk screal flower."
"115740052-0-3520";"Get away from there!"
"115740052-0-3521";"I shall return to the village, but you must stop the wagons!"
"115740052-0-3522";"Is this a dream? What's going on here?"
"115740052-0-3523";"I must get back to the village. Farathan will be quite cross!"
"115740052-0-3527";"Your head will make a fine trophy."
"115740052-0-3528";"snores."
"115740052-0-3529";"This isn't the way to the camp. We have to turn back!"
"115740052-0-3534";"I saw dreugh dragging Arcady toward the statue of King Joile! That way!"
"115740052-0-3556";"He's waiting for you in the other room. Follow me."
"115740052-0-3557";"Better now, dear woman, for I see our foretold friend has arrived. The wheel revolves. Hope sprouts when triumph shines near. Can we ask for more?"
"115740052-0-3558";"We abide in the ""Gray Maybe."" What can any of us speak but riddles?"
"115740052-0-3559";"sighs."
"115740052-0-3560";"But never mind that! Come close my friend, and speak with an old man. The Planemeld continues, and I have much to tell you...."
"115740052-0-3593";"Who calls upon the Stone Warden?"
"115740052-0-3595";"barks at the cow, and the cow starts to follow."
"115740052-0-3596";"Here I am! Come quickly!"
"115740052-0-3597";"You dare to enter my sanctum?"
"115740052-0-3598";"They have outlived their usefulness, as have you. Enjoy your last few breaths!"
"115740052-0-3599";"You think you can stop me from flooding this place! Ha!"
"115740052-0-3600";"Kill her then! It's the only way!"
"115740052-0-3605";"Foul abomination! In the name of Hermaeus Mora, I command you to desist!"
"115740052-0-3606";"Impressive."
"115740052-0-3607";"Begone, mortal!"
"115740052-0-3609";"I wanted to wait until you were both here … to die together!"
"115740052-0-3611";"They're torturing the Chief Constable at the lighthouse. You've got to help him!"
"115740052-0-3614";"moos contentedly."
"115740052-0-3615";"Hey! Can you help me? Look in the cave!"
"115740052-0-3617";"<You hear vague, ominous whispers.>"
"115740052-0-3620";"No! Don't let her get the Water Stone!"
"115740052-0-3621";"Wait! I can hide in those rocks to the north!"
"115740052-0-3622";"Team One has interacted with the big red box. Oh Nooo!"
"115740052-0-3623";"Team Two has interacted with the big red box. Oh Nooo!"
"115740052-0-3624";"Team Three has interacted with the big red box. Oh Nooo!"
"115740052-0-3629";"I'm free of this accursed necropolis! The merchant at the gates... take us to her. Hide us in her caravan. We must escape!"
"115740052-0-3633";"You will pay for defiling my altar!"
"115740052-0-3666";"Who dares attempt to destroy my work? You will pay for this!"
"115740052-0-3672";"opens the Keening Box."
"115740052-0-3676";"Taros? Have you finally come to see me?"
"115740052-0-3683";"I want to live! Get away from me!"
"115740052-0-3686";"Take this missive to Councilor Miluru immediately."
"115740052-0-3688";"Yes. Come closer."
"115740052-0-3692";"You may not enter without Tirinaat's permission."
"115740052-0-3693";"This is Tirinaat's yurt. Do you have permission to enter?"
"115740052-0-3694";"Has Tirinaat given you her permission to enter?"
"115740052-0-3695";"Outlander! That is forbidden!"
"115740052-0-3696";"Hold! Do not place that amulet on my grave! Are you seeking my destruction?"
"115740052-0-3697";"If you do not complete your appointed task, I will take the amulet from your corpse and place it there myself!"
"115740052-0-3698";"So you could not rest after ordering my murder. Dres lapdog! I will not be silenced so easily!"

"115740052-0-3851";"Those n'wah will do anything for a spot of food. Why shouldn't enjoy watching them do it?"

"115740052-0-3854";"Wait here. I won't be long."
"115740052-0-3855";"Come along."

"115740052-0-3889";"You fool! I knew you'd come to steal the sword. The Imperial army shows no mercy to thieves!"
"115740052-0-3892";"Captain, I have grave news."
"115740052-0-3893";"Save your breath! Guards, put this traitor into custody."
"115740052-0-3894";"Disobeying an order can have harsher consequences than you think. We'll deal with you soon enough."
"115740052-0-3895";"Unhand me, guard! I will not be dragged to the irons like a thief. The councilor will hear of this. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-3896";"Why is this blade in my hand? No!"
"115740052-0-3897";"cracks and shatters."
"115740052-0-3898";"What happened? I'm free? I'm finally free!"
"115740052-0-3899";"I don't know how you did it, but you've freed me. I thought my confinement would be eternal."
"115740052-0-3900";"I'm off to reunite with my sister. I can sense her presence nearby...."
"115740052-0-3901";"Can it be? After countless years... freedom?"
"115740052-0-3902";"Was this your doing? You have my eternal gratitude. It's been so long. I had given up hope."
"115740052-0-3903";"At last, I can sense my sister's presence. I must go to her."
"115740052-0-3904";"I cannot allow you to break the seal!"
"115740052-0-3905";"Stop, slave!"
"115740052-0-3906";"Calling you ""brother"" makes my skin crawl!"
"115740052-0-3907";"You disgust me! I'd take your head as a trophy, but it's so ugly, I'd have to bury it."
"115740052-0-3909";"Dumac take you! I'm cursed just by looking at you!"
"115740052-0-3910";"I'd rip your traitorous heart out if I didn't think your blood would poison me."
"115740052-0-3911";"I curse the day you were born! Not even Vivec could find a use for worthless n'wah like you."
"115740052-0-3912";"Keep your putrid mouth shut, s'wit! Even a cliff racer couldn't survive the stench of your fetid breath."
"115740052-0-3913";"What pathetic insults! You'll eat your words. I'll feed them to you on the point of my sword!"
"115740052-0-3924";"Good fight. You're worthy to join the Fighters Guild as far as I'm concerned, sera."
"115740052-0-3927";"Thank you. You can tell the Ordinators they'll get my full cooperation."
"115740052-0-3929";"Another victim for the caldera? Your blood shall fuel my creation!"
"115740052-0-3931";"I cannot die! Not yet!"
"115740052-0-3932";"How dare you interfere! From your soul, I will strengthen the plague. From your death, thousands more will die!"
"115740052-0-3933";"I will not bow to those traitors. I choose death!"
"115740052-0-3935";"Friend, have you considered the real value of your soul?"
"115740052-0-3936";"You there! Will you let your soul fall into the hands of Daedra?"
"115740052-0-3937";"Do you think you have nothing? You always have your soul!"
"115740052-0-3938";"I'd best not die today. The wife would never forgive me, and neither would my mistress!"
"115740052-0-3939";"Troll's blood! You've got a bit of a fire in your belly, don't you? I'd gladly fight at your side."
"115740052-0-3940";"Next time I won't let you win. Tell the Steward to send me someone stronger next time."
"115740052-0-3941";"You've fought well. I've seen what you can do and I'm sure the Steward has, as well."
"115740052-0-3944";"rolls a one!"
"115740052-0-3945";"rolls a two!"
"115740052-0-3946";"rolls a three!"

"115740052-0-3948";"What? What is…?"
"115740052-0-3949";"Not you, that's for sure, haha!"
"115740052-0-3960";"You will never reach the Canonreeve. Come! I will be your opponent."
"115740052-0-3961";"Well fought."
"115740052-0-3962";"I don't know how you caught wind of the Canonreeve's plan, but you will not stop us."
"115740052-0-3963";"You won't stop me. My Prince is coming, with an army that will end this war for the Altmer."
"115740052-0-3964";"Death … is not the end!"
"115740052-0-3965";"What did you think you could do here?"
"115740052-0-3978";"You there! I wish to speak to you."
"115740052-0-3981";"You! My revenge begins here, and your corpse will join all the others..."
"115740052-0-3982";"Brought out of the bones only to be sent back again... without my revenge... a curse on you!"
"115740052-0-3983";"This is the price you pay! This is the price he will pay for my torment and slaughter!"
"115740052-0-3988";"The Three have abandoned me! I must flee this wretched temple."
"115740052-0-3990";"No! I can feel it crawling on my skin. I won't let you take me away!"
"115740052-0-3991";"What's this? You're no priest. You want to poison me!"
"115740052-0-4000";"The Three! They finally speak to me!"
"115740052-0-4001";"Thank you. You have no idea. My path is finally clear."

"115740052-0-4010";"House Father, you have been accused of necromancy. You have aided the spread of plague throughout Stonefalls."
"115740052-0-4011";"Soon it will spread through all of Morrowind. It already filters into Deshaan!"
"115740052-0-4012";"You don't deny these accusation? You would threaten Deshaan's safety?"
"115740052-0-4013";"I no longer answer to the Tribunal Temple. I've discovered the true path. I fulfill my master's will."
"115740052-0-4014";"The disease will engulf you all. When my master rises, we will crush the Almsivi! \nThe Great Houses will bow down to no one!"

"115740052-0-4043";"I'm much better, now that I can see you're safe. I couldn't go on if I didn't know you were safe."
"115740052-0-4044";"My wife and my children are my life. We've been blessed this day... and we've been blessed by this stranger's deeds."

"115740052-0-4101";"Who … are you?"
"115740052-0-4102";"All too easy."
"115740052-0-4103";"There will be no place for rabble like you when the Pellingares rule Wayrest!"
"115740052-0-4105";"You peasants were simply out-classed."
"115740052-0-4125";"Thank you. After all these years, my spirit is finally free!"

"115740052-0-4136";"Hang on! There's more headed this way."

"115740052-0-5251";"If you're the best they have to offer, Stormhold is guaranteed to fall!"
"115740052-0-5252";"'Bout time someone taught that mercenary a lesson!"
"115740052-0-5253";"Give those mercenaries what they deserve!"
"115740052-0-5254";"Looks like someone's here to put these mercenaries in their place!"
"115740052-0-5261";"I thought this would be my last pilgrimage. Thank you, friend."
"115740052-0-5262";"Did Neekta send you? She escaped not long after the dryskins fell upon us."
"115740052-0-5263";"Have you seen Neekta? She led our pilgrimage to Bogmother, but lost sight of us when we were captured."
"115740052-0-5264";"We come here each wet season. It is not for these outsiders to defile."
"115740052-0-5265";"I saw Neekta under Bogmother's shadow. Please, help her, as you have helped us."
"115740052-0-5269";"rumbles as a strange creature climbs from its depths."
"115740052-0-5270";"Do you think yourself too good to have a drink with me? Look at me! I am of the superior race! You should feel honored that I even show interest in you."
"115740052-0-5271";"Master Lorkus, this creature seeks to destroy what you have created!"
"115740052-0-5272";"Ha! You think to stop us with your primitive swamp-magic?"
"115740052-0-5273";"I will show you what true power is!"
"115740052-0-5274";"The fools seek to despoil Bogmother even as we speak. Her wrath will not be contained!"
"115740052-0-5276";"Stay awake. Please, Marimah. Try to stay awake."
"115740052-0-5278";"Wait! Please don't leave me out here alone!"
"115740052-0-5294";"I've marked the weak one! Assassinate him!"
"115740052-0-5297";"I cannot accept that. You will be jailed until your background can be fully investigated."
"115740052-0-5298";"Captain, may I ask why you are harassing my slave?"
"115740052-0-5299";"That's a good trick. I'll have to remember that one!"
"115740052-0-5300";"You hear me boys? This one doesn't leave the camp alive!"
"115740052-0-5304";"Yes, that's done it... but now I must flee! There are only two Soul Gems left. My dear assistants, I fear one of you must stay behind."
"115740052-0-5308";"Stop, stop, please! By the stars, I think this is far enough."
"115740052-0-5313";"Stop this! Imprison the elves!"
"115740052-0-5314";"Fire! Fire! Escape, quickly!"
"115740052-0-5315";"These are dangerous criminals. Do not allow them to escape!"
"115740052-0-5318";"Get away! Away! Away!"
"115740052-0-5319";"I'll tell you nothing! Die!"
"115740052-0-5320";"All right, all right! I've seen some strange people around here lately. Used to just be smugglers from the east paying us a visit, but not these guys. That's all I know, I swear!"
"115740052-0-5322";"attracts Flashflitters almost immediately and is soon glowing brightly from the insects swarming over it."
"115740052-0-5324";"mutters incoherently before wandering off toward the ruins."
"115740052-0-5327";"Stop, please! Listen, a bunch of Khajiit moved in just east of here. Crazy looking cats, and ugly too. They've been showing up around here, late at night. They don't belong here."
"115740052-0-5328";"Not the face! I... I'll talk. Those Khajiit to the east? They're part of some crazy cult. They're looking for stranglers around here. People that won't be missed. Can't say what for."
"115740052-0-5329";"Fine, I'll talk! That Khajiit cult in Bloodgutter's been paying us to take people to them. Only been there once, but... they're doing something bad there. Go look yourself! They're just to the east."
"115740052-0-5330";"Stand away from the cargo, citizen!"
"115740052-0-5335";"Intruder or visitor? Looks like another rescue from Lei-Kai."
"115740052-0-5350";"Enough! I'm beaten. Leadership of the Cult of the Fang now falls to you."
"115740052-0-5356";"It's finally over. Did they agree to our terms?"
"115740052-0-5358";"Feed, my children. Fatten with blood."
"115740052-0-5370";"Remember what you have seen."
"115740052-0-5371";"Remember the fear."
"115740052-0-5372";"You will know it again."
"115740052-0-5374";"I have other duties to attend to. I'll be here in the camp if you need me."
"115740052-0-5375";"No, no, it's all wrong! We have to start over."
"115740052-0-5376";"Let's add a little sweetness to it."
"115740052-0-5377";"Not enough kick. More spice!"
"115740052-0-5378";"We need to thicken this up some."
"115740052-0-5379";"Yes, yes, that's it! It smells wonderful."
"115740052-0-5380";"What's that? No!"
"115740052-0-5381";"We must escape before she returns!"
"115740052-0-5383";"You must stay. I insist."
"115740052-0-5384";"I will inform the camp of today's events. Farewell."
"115740052-0-5385";"Leave that alone! Will you deny me my rest?"
"115740052-0-5386";"If this fails, Keira, I will not sit idle any longer."
"115740052-0-5387";"Stop. This village has been seized by Nagas."
"115740052-0-5388";"I told you that I would remember you at the inn, twit. You'll not interfere with my activities in this town again!"
"115740052-0-5389";"Lookie at what we have here boys. Take his stuff and throw him into the ocean."
"115740052-0-5392";"Calm night seas and a strong wind. It's a smuggler's life."
"115740052-0-5393";"When the Blood Cat calls the Sangiin will rule."
"115740052-0-5394";"Can someone keep that bloody bird quiet!"
"115740052-0-5397";"Be sure to keep the braziers stoked brother."
"115740052-0-5398";"Have we received word from our Blood cat brothers in the south?"
"115740052-0-5399";"For who can control the urges of blood?"""
"115740052-0-5400";"I must deliver my report. Fate smile on you."
"115740052-0-5406";"Bleet!"
"115740052-0-5414";"Do not think you will get away so easily!"
"115740052-0-5431";"Is this nightmare over?"
"115740052-0-5432";"Where am I? I have to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-5433";"So much blood... in my eyes, in my teeth!"
"115740052-0-5435";"You've come too late. They're already gone."
"115740052-0-5437";"You there! Stop where you are!"
"115740052-0-5438";"This is a mistake. We should just kill the prisoners and be done with them. And those merchants? I hardly consider them worthy of joining us."
"115740052-0-5444";"Thief! Guards, apprehend this scoundrel!"
"115740052-0-5445";"Arr!"
"115740052-0-5446";"Grr!"
"115740052-0-5447";"Rarg!"
"115740052-0-5452";"Everyone is trying to kill me!"
"115740052-0-5453";"What's this? The trees were right!"
"115740052-0-5454";"Stop it! Stop the screaming!"
"115740052-0-5461";"The blood of our people fuels the Dunmer's war."
"115740052-0-5463";"The Knahaten Flu set the other races against us. It proved that we must reject foreign influence and protect our own if we are to survive these trying times."
"115740052-0-5464";"Can you help us? Please...."
"115740052-0-5465";"The fire comes.... It will consume us!"
"115740052-0-5466";"It's close now.... I can feel the burning!"
"115740052-0-5467";"You're too late!"
"115740052-0-5468";"Turn back! These ruins are not for the living."
"115740052-0-5470";"Seems we've an eavesdropper. You won't leave here alive, dog!"
"115740052-0-5471";"You've got your quarry, lizard. I expect to be paid in full."
"115740052-0-5472";"With the insurgents gone, our work with the Worm Cult can continue. You've earned your freedom."
"115740052-0-5473";"You will tremble at our might once we've obtained the Skull! The Worm Cult shall crush you all!"
"115740052-0-5474";"You will not live to see it, lukiul."
"115740052-0-5478";"You would choose those two wrinkled old frumps over me? You must be blind!"
"115740052-0-5479";"How could you? I was not meant to die like this!"
"115740052-0-5480";"You idiot! Do not dare leave me behind. Come back here and free me! Telenger, please!"
"115740052-0-5482";"We've come to help."
"115740052-0-5486";"Good. All done. Going back to shore to pass out."
"115740052-0-5487";"What's going on here up there?"
"115740052-0-5488";"Think we won. Going to go throw up some more."
"115740052-0-5489";"Bah! The Master will be furious."
"115740052-0-5493";"is locked."
"115740052-0-5495";"Another gangling one? Pray, what boon do you seek?"
"115740052-0-5497";"As we all shall rejoin the Hist, so has our egg-brother journeyed ahead. May the Tree shade your path."
"115740052-0-5504";"New life courses through me!"
"115740052-0-5505";"This doesn't taste like it usual..."
"115740052-0-5508";"Shade-Tail is gone already. I fear the worst."
"115740052-0-5509";"Psst!! <<1>>! Wait, I want to talk to you!"
"115740052-0-5517";"Foolish and cowardly man! You would not even try and save me when the cursed of Alakar killed me!"
"115740052-0-5518";"Let me tell you the truth, my weak husband-that-was. I am better off dead than living a life with you! Weak-willed, sand-spined, cowardly mongoose!"
"115740052-0-5519";"At first, my worthless husband, I did not want to die. But now? I am strong, and powerful and I will make your life a misery for ETERNITY!"
"115740052-0-5521";"What... what have you done? Now here is the ghost of my wife, come to haunt me. Oh, <<1>>, why did you do this terrible thing to me? Oh, poor Jarakhad.  Woe is Jarakhad, twice over cursed by Alakad..."
"115740052-0-5523";"Your choices are wrong. Now, face the consequences."
"115740052-0-5524";"reacts to the smell of musk."
"115740052-0-5525";"You're not taking me alive!"
"115740052-0-5527";"doesn't react to the worker."
"115740052-0-5534";"Sweet Mother, hear our prayers. Sweet Mother, your children cry for vengeance!"
"115740052-0-5535";"More sorcery! The gods will curse you for this!"
"115740052-0-5537";"Your completion of the ritual has saved us."
"115740052-0-5538";"Free at last! Perhaps one day you will be justly rewarded for releasing me. Hahahahaha!"
"115740052-0-5539";"You'll not be takin' Inerri's hard-earned trophy bird! Die!"
"115740052-0-5540";"Ah, I see you found aid, Elennae? Perhaps now you will manage to be useful!"
"115740052-0-5547";"This orb is poorly attuned. It should be easy to disrupt."
"115740052-0-5548";"stops to smell the cheese."
"115740052-0-5549";"The necromancer is drawing power from here as well! I wonder how much power is being drawn...?"
"115740052-0-5560";"Not that way! I will not leave the ruins until my task is done."
"115740052-0-5561";"Thank you for your help! You should talk to Telenger, he will know what to do next."
"115740052-0-5563";"Do let me know how well digging in the mud works for you, Meliara. An excellent use of your time, I am sure."
"115740052-0-5564";"Taking help, Meliara? I see you are not above seeking aid either!"
"115740052-0-5565";"Meliara is already back at our camp, pointedly avoiding questions about her search for this crown. Do try not to let her tak all the credit for your work."
"115740052-0-5567";"I'm still not persuaded."
"115740052-0-5568";"We've been over this."
"115740052-0-5569";"Not to my satisfaction."
"115740052-0-5570";"You won't be satisfied until we break the agreement with the Worm Cult."
"115740052-0-5571";"How can we be sure of their intentions?"
"115740052-0-5572";"Mannimarco's goal lies far from Black Marsh."
"115740052-0-5573";"Some must feed the Tree for the good of all. So it's always been."
"115740052-0-5574";"Will that excuse killing our own?"
"115740052-0-5575";"This council yields no fruit, Shathlen. Let us recess."
"115740052-0-5582";"That will keep them back for a while. The Dominion reigns!"
"115740052-0-5585";"Debts are always repayed... in one way or another."
"115740052-0-5587";"Wait. You must not go there unprepared."
"115740052-0-5589";"Good hunting, stranger. I will meet you at the shrine's mouth."
"115740052-0-5590";"What? How did you... no matter! You will fall before the power of Fharel the Necromancer!"
"115740052-0-5591";"Even if I am killed, my minions will remain! They will..."
"115740052-0-5594";"Thank you! That was terrible!"
"115740052-0-5601";"The Master demands supplication. Do not question his will."
"115740052-0-5602";"You toy with powers greater than you know."
"115740052-0-5603";"Hmm, that is interesting. This one smells something strange and unnoticed before. A perfume perhaps? Or cats...."
"115740052-0-5606";"Fool! Your insolence is no matter. The faithful will make use of your corpse."
"115740052-0-5607";"Your soul is weak! You are no use to us."
"115740052-0-5608";"Arg!"
"115740052-0-5612";"I only wanted to recover what was mine!"
"115740052-0-5613";"Do you know what kind of people you're working for?"
"115740052-0-5614";"I am not a thief. The items I took belong to me!"
"115740052-0-5615";"The people of White Rose Village are not who you think they are."
"115740052-0-5616";"comes alive with overgrowth and the Tear of Andrial shatters! Y'ffre is pleased by the offering."
"115740052-0-5622";"I knew you'd lead me to the treasure! Give me the treasure and maybe I'll let you live!"
"115740052-0-5623";"It's impolite to listen at windows."
"115740052-0-5625";"Intruder! You will not undo our work!"
"115740052-0-5626";"I control the very power of death! You cannot think to defeat me!"
"115740052-0-5627";"The wards shall sustain me!"
"115740052-0-5628";"No! The barrier... falls...."
"115740052-0-5629";"You... you will pay for that!"
"115740052-0-5633";"Honored one, the Uxith-Ei would like to speak to you."
"115740052-0-5635";"The scent... it is back. Come, follow Ma'Zarman."
"115740052-0-5636";"The trail leads here. We must find what is giving off this smell."
"115740052-0-5637";"You find something good, yes? Or you peeking at sneaky letters?"
"115740052-0-5638";"What is it? Why does a list of names interest you so?"
"115740052-0-5640";"Finally, you arrive! Now you shall join me as one of my own!"
"115740052-0-5642";"You... were not weakened. I was... betrayed."
"115740052-0-5644";"Thank you for saving my life! My memories are starting to return. I can't stay in this pit another second."
"115740052-0-5648";"Let us drink!"
"115740052-0-5651";"crumples over from drinking too much."
"115740052-0-5652";"bursts from the earth in a cloud of dust!"
"115740052-0-5653";"Thank you. The corruption in my ward is gone … but the other wards … you must find them."
"115740052-0-5655";"The eggs must not be disturbed."
"115740052-0-5657";"You waste your flesh. But I can redeem it."
"115740052-0-5658";"I'm here, Relazar. We all are."
"115740052-0-5659";"What is this?"
"115740052-0-5660";"It's the end."
"115740052-0-5663";"Stop!"
"115740052-0-5665";"Our water!"
"115740052-0-5671";"It is dangerous here, stranger! I have... angered the spirits."
"115740052-0-5673";"Begone, interloper!"
"115740052-0-5675";"throws water from the bucket."
"115740052-0-5679";"begins to flee as it senses the wand nearby."
"115740052-0-5681";"Enough! Enough! Have it your way!"
"115740052-0-5682";"No! Do you realize what you've done? You've destroyed everything we've created here!"
"115740052-0-5688";"Oh, thank you! The Huntress was going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-5690";"You bellowed?"
"115740052-0-5691";"We got a job. Go north to Ten-Maur-Wolk. I'll meet you there later."
"115740052-0-5695";"So glad of you to finally arrive. I expect you brought my coin? I... who are you? You're not the Imperials! You'll not leave here alive."
"115740052-0-5696";"How dare you!\n\nIt doesn't matter, fool! I will still triumph at Moonhenge!"
"115740052-0-5697";"You have no idea how much it cost me to create that!\n\nYour doom will fall at Moonhenge!"
"115740052-0-5698";"Your betrayal will not go unpunished, worm.\n\nAfter my triumph at Moonhenge, I will see to you!"
"115740052-0-5699";"Death will be slow for you, traitor.\n\nFace me at Moonhenge, if you dare!"
"115740052-0-5700";"Thank you... for this... release."
"115740052-0-5701";"Sound the alarm, an intruder! Do not let them hide or escape!"
"115740052-0-5702";"There's a spy in our midst! Sound the alarm!"
"115740052-0-5704";"There it is! Finally I will be rid of this!"
"115740052-0-5705";"Take the Skull, friend! You must... protect yourself!"
"115740052-0-5706";"You're a wily one, but your journey ends here."
"115740052-0-5711";"You dare to turn the dead against me?"
"115740052-0-5714";"No... what is this? I cannot be... destroyed!"
"115740052-0-5720";"Ha! You cannot think to use the Skull! You know nothing of its power!"
"115740052-0-5721";"feels the mudcrab begin to struggle. Pull the string!"
"115740052-0-5722";"feels the string break! The mudcrab is lost."
"115740052-0-5729";"Let us get underway. We have much work to do before we can call this mission a success."
"115740052-0-5744";"This drink is wonderful, but it's a bit more tart than I remember. I'll just take a seat for a moment and think on my actions while I enjoy this."
"115740052-0-5756";"I have an urgent message for you! We need your help!"
"115740052-0-5770";"There we are. Let's see what they have that I can use..."
"115740052-0-5772";"Hey, you, over there! I'm in here! I need to talk to you!"
"115740052-0-5773";"Can you even hear me? Hello? I'm in here!"
"115740052-0-5774";"Hey, pay attention to me! I'm in here! You remind me of my wife. She never listens to me, either!"
"115740052-0-5775";"No! Get away from that!"
"115740052-0-5776";"Every king needs a crown."
"115740052-0-5778";"runs his hands over the metal of the crude crown. His eyes glaze over and his thoughts seem miles away."
"115740052-0-5779";"No! We will not abandon our own to this plague! Move all the newly afflicted to the sick house. Send for more blankets and fresh water. We will not let this sickness beat us!"
"115740052-0-5781";"shakes his head briefly."
"115740052-0-5789";"You'll never catch me, fool!"
"115740052-0-5790";"Let go of me!"
"115740052-0-5791";"Vandal! Cut that out!"
"115740052-0-5799";"Thank you friend."
"115740052-0-5800";"Thank you friend."
"115740052-0-5803";"I come anon. My body will sink into the earth. My soul will be caught in your branches. Give me the strength to be calm."
"115740052-0-5810";"Remember us! Remember your people, Remember your duty!"
"115740052-0-5813";"Fight on! The... Dominion... reigns..."
"115740052-0-5815";"Teach this one a lesson."
"115740052-0-5816";"They're like children playing with their own droppings."
"115740052-0-5818";"Witless buffoon. You fell for my plan. Now the estate will be mine!"
"115740052-0-5820";"Where did all these fires come frome? The entire village is burning!"
"115740052-0-5821";"I can't believe this! I'm going to lose everything! Where did these fires come from?"
"115740052-0-5822";"Did anyone see where that atronach came from? When I find out who's responsible for this..."
"115740052-0-5823";"There will be an investigation into this, I assure you! We will find out who caused this and they will suffer!"
"115740052-0-5851";"By right of steel and blood, light and magicka, the Champion carries his name."
"115740052-0-5852";"His blade sang the song of glory, the glory of the Ayleid, children of the sun."
"115740052-0-5853";"Our foe, our bane, the giant-men of the north, fell with their feral king, Yotunmir, by the Champion's might."
"115740052-0-5857";"What's going on?"
"115740052-0-5858";"Where are you taking me …?"
"115740052-0-5859";"Please. I don't understand. I was … I was …."
"115740052-0-5860";"Oh. Oh. It's a dream. I see."
"115740052-0-5861";"In a cave. What a strange, strange dream."
"115740052-0-5864";"Get inside and kill the General! I shall make sure the Imperials do not follow and flank you. The Dominion prevails!"
"115740052-0-5865";"Please, listen to yourself! Our purpose was to protect Valenwood and its inhabitants, not massacre them. Why must you do this?"
"115740052-0-5866";"No, Amyrlin, stop! What are you doing? These are your allies! Your family!"
"115740052-0-5867";"Who dares?"
"115740052-0-5869";"I feel like… like I'm getting my will back!"
"115740052-0-5870";"Neither man nor mer can stop the rain."
"115740052-0-5873";"Wait! I don't have to follow you! I'm free!"
"115740052-0-5874";"I did not rise to the rank of General by yielding to swine such as you! For the Empire!"
"115740052-0-5875";"This isn't over, Dominion dogs! Not... over..."
"115740052-0-5880";"We will extinguish this."
"115740052-0-5881";"The flames are out of control! Retreat! Every man for himself!"
"115740052-0-5882";"Now is the time! For Valenwood! For the Dominion! Charge!"
"115740052-0-5885";"gets confused and wanders off."
"115740052-0-5888";"Hey, you! Hand over all your money, or you're gonna get it!"
"115740052-0-5889";"Our bellies churn like the tides do before a storm."
"115740052-0-5890";"Calm waters are prosperous waters."
"115740052-0-5893";"Back so soon? Show me what you ... wait, you're not one of my men!"
"115740052-0-5896";"The scent stops here. Go on ahead. This one will stand watch."
"115740052-0-5899";"The totem is remade?"
"115740052-0-5920";"If you're not going to help me, I'll find my own way back."
"115740052-0-5940";"Who passes?"
"115740052-0-5941";"You must be purified!"
"115740052-0-5945";"Times were simpler before Zud-Reen found the giant's skull."
"115740052-0-5947";"Your fires are spreading, Dominion churl! You'll be burned alive along with me!"
"115740052-0-5948";"You think I did not plan for this contingency? I will drag your body through the forest while the Wood Elves weep for their dead hero!"
"115740052-0-5949";"I will not be defeated by the likes of you! We will have this land, and all will tremble at the sight of our banners!"
"115740052-0-5951";"conjures a shield of force to protect himself. Drag him through the flames to break it!"
"115740052-0-5957";"Stop! See what is before you, not the lies of the Huntress!"
"115740052-0-5970";"Come with me to the bridge. We can speak safely there."
"115740052-0-5971";"What are you doing? Stay away from me!"
"115740052-0-5972";"Are you reckoned wise among your people? We shall see."
"115740052-0-5979";"I knew it! I knew you came to the farm just to kill me!"
"115740052-0-5986";"The skull is safe with us. We have protected it for years."
"115740052-0-5989";"You would summon me? Hircine has given me to power to destroy any who stand in my way. Come. Feel the wraith of Valenwood! Come and challenge me!"
"115740052-0-5990";"I'm not stopping here! Those things are too close! I'll meet you at the castle, Phinis!"
"115740052-0-5995";"Ma'jhad is too smart for you! You fell into Ma'jhad's trap, yes you did. Die, fool!"
"115740052-0-5997";"Thank... you."
"115740052-0-6004";"I've got to get away from here!"
"115740052-0-6018";"The Omen of Blood controls my dreams. Free me from it."
"115740052-0-6020";"The Omen's influence increases. Soon others will fall."
"115740052-0-6021";"You've done it. I'm … free."
"115740052-0-6024";"It's trapped me in the manor house. Find me."
"115740052-0-6035";"Master Vardishal! The Imperial legions approach, driving beasts of fire before them like dogs!"
"115740052-0-6036";"Hold your ground! Do not give these Imperials even an inch!"
"115740052-0-6037";"Defilers! You would see all of Valenwood burn just to make a point?"
"115740052-0-6038";"Amorline! Amorline! Where are you when we need you? You abandoned us for your precious Hircine!"
"115740052-0-6039";"Burn, fools! Such is the fate of all who defy the Empire!"
"115740052-0-6040";"We are not lost yet! I swear to you, invaders, that not even death shall halt our promise of renewal!"
"115740052-0-6041";"This mirror is not for your eyes. Look away. Go away."
"115740052-0-6042";"Nature has been violated. It must be undone."
"115740052-0-6043";"Stop! I yield!"
"115740052-0-6046";"Which coterie sent you?"
"115740052-0-6047";"No trade was scheduled!"
"115740052-0-6048";"A raid! Defend our work!"
"115740052-0-6056";"No! Get away from that! I won't let you destroy her very memory!"
"115740052-0-6069";"Mages of Starvale! We have delivered upon our promise! Let this scarred land be renewed!"
"115740052-0-6076";"My mother … she was in the dream too! Is she …? I have to get home!"
"115740052-0-6077";"She lives? My vessel is not prepared!? Then you will be my vessel!"
"115740052-0-6098";"Snakes! Damn you, Devanir!"
"115740052-0-6099";"Argh! Jemmaril, bring me another glimmerwine!"
"115740052-0-6100";"Thank you again, friend. I am going to return to camp and ensure my apprentices are... cooperating."
"115740052-0-6123";"Hey. What are you trying to pull here? This isn't the way!"
"115740052-0-6152";"Hey, where are you taking me? Why are we going this way? You're making me nervous."
"115740052-0-6153";"No! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-6154";"I am ruined! Xane, why did you abandon me to this fate?"
"115740052-0-6158";"You are decieved! Do not do this!"
"115740052-0-6169";"That sword! You loved it more than you ever loved me!"
"115740052-0-6170";"When they came, they took us into the courtyard… I thought you would rescue us. Where were you?"
"115740052-0-6171";"Why, father? Why did you abandon us? Why did you let us die?"
"115740052-0-6172";"Sorry General. We can't deploy so many against the Ironhand Ogres. Why do you ask for three regiments?"
"115740052-0-6173";"Vengeance. Emeric trusts me. I can make Wayrest suffer as Orsinium did!"
"115740052-0-6174";"I won't refuse allies, but don't forget who's in charge."
"115740052-0-6175";"Of course, General. After we sack Wayrest and kill the king, you can have the city. We just want the people."
"115740052-0-6179";"The Scamps are going to kill my sister! Someone has to rescue her!"
"115740052-0-6180";"Oh, my poor deluded sister! Thank you for saving her, as confused as she is!"
"115740052-0-6183";"Chase them! We have to chase them away. Away!"
"115740052-0-6184";"If you won't give it to me, I'll take it from your corpse!"
"115740052-0-6185";"You're a Dreamer in disguise! You can't fool me!"
"115740052-0-6187";"I can't believe I'm still alive after that. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-6189";"I will not see this curse take another."
"115740052-0-6190";"She'll live. I need to speak with you in private. Bring the talisman."
"115740052-0-6196";"Ahhhhhhhhhh! It buuuurrrrnnns!"
"115740052-0-6200";"I can follow you no further."
"115740052-0-6201";"I fade ... back to Aetherius ...."
"115740052-0-6202";"PLACEHOLDER: Rise and destroy these fools!"
"115740052-0-6203";"This one is grateful, young one. Please. Meet Dro-Dara in the storehouse. There it will be safe."
"115740052-0-6204";"You killed them all! I won't be your sacrifice!"
"115740052-0-6205";"I remember."
"115740052-0-6206";"This was once my family's home. What has it become?"
"115740052-0-6207";"The courtyard. It is there."
"115740052-0-6208";"No cure! Only pain and death!"
"115740052-0-6216";"Someone has to make them pay, someone has to make them suffer!"
"115740052-0-6217";"The thought of the poison coursing is such a beautiful picture!"
"115740052-0-6219";"Oh, Stendarr! What's wrong with me?"
"115740052-0-6237";"We must maintain the purity of the Daggerfall Covenant. Raiment got what he deserved!"
"115740052-0-6238";"Please, you have to help us."
"115740052-0-6239";"We need your help."
"115740052-0-6240";"Help! Please, anybody!"
"115740052-0-6247";"You there! Hello? Look up here. I need your help!"
"115740052-0-6254";"will not leave the Dro-Dara Plantation."
"115740052-0-6255";"Murk-Water has had his vengeance."
"115740052-0-6260";"Vaermina, drink this blood I now spill!"
"115740052-0-6267";"Stay away! It's a trap!"
"115740052-0-6268";"Save the duchess! Her life's in danger!"
"115740052-0-6280";"Get those plans back as fast you can! May the Eight protect you!"
"115740052-0-6281";"You cannot stop the bloody hand of The Three!"
"115740052-0-6285";"If this is what it's come down to, then so be it!"
"115740052-0-6295";"What have you done? You meddling creature of flesh!"
"115740052-0-6315";"Ooh! Here's one that'll fetch a high price!"
"115740052-0-6344";"Excuse me, good sir or madam! Hello! Won't you come speak with me?"
"115740052-0-6350";"Help! It burns! Put it out!"
"115740052-0-6361";"Let's get going then."
"115740052-0-6391";"Did Edain send you with his little toy sword? I will rise again!"
"115740052-0-6395";"Hold, mortal. You must go no farther."
"115740052-0-6399";"Sir Hughes is here, but I need to speak to you before you see him."
"115740052-0-6409";"Daedra worshiper!"
"115740052-0-6410";"You won't take me for your bloody sacrifices!"
"115740052-0-6411";"Practice your dark arts elsewhere!"
"115740052-0-6412";"Enemy of the Eight! Get away!"
"115740052-0-6427";"Kill her!"
"115740052-0-6440";"They're going to rob us!"
"115740052-0-6441";"They say slavers are around."
"115740052-0-6444";"Why are you helping them?"
"115740052-0-6445";"I demand to be let on board."
"115740052-0-6447";"They'll kill us all!"
"115740052-0-6448";"We're not letting them off."
"115740052-0-6449";"The villagers will just have to be patient."
"115740052-0-6450";"No one likes the situiation, but we have to accept it."
"115740052-0-6451";"Don't worry. I'm sure everything will be straightened out soon."
"115740052-0-6452";"You people have to just calm down. Stop asking questions."
"115740052-0-6453";"We have the situation under control."
"115740052-0-6462";"There must be a way House Tamrith can benefit from this nonsense."
"115740052-0-6468";"Lie still. I'm sure Balcone will return with help."
"115740052-0-6469";"I get out of ropes. Juicy woman. Eat your face! Juicy. Sweet."
"115740052-0-6470";"Please don't say things like that, Marcel."
"115740052-0-6474";"Crelie? What happened to me?"
"115740052-0-6475";"Marcel, I was afraid you weren't in there anymore."
"115740052-0-6481";"I heard she killed a Knight of the Flame and stole that armor."
"115740052-0-6482";"You think the constable would lock up a real Knight of the Flame?"
"115740052-0-6483";"I'll admit I was surprised he broke up with Sabyssa. She's gorgeous!"
"115740052-0-6484";"I'd be careful you don't say that too loud. I heard Sabyssa was once quite a swordsman."
"115740052-0-6485";"You know, underneath all that steel, that knight actually has a pretty attractive figure."
"115740052-0-6486";"I don't know. I could've sworn I'd seen her up at Castle Alcaire."
"115740052-0-6487";"You have to admit… he has been acting strange lately."
"115740052-0-6488";"I'll say. That's one forge I wouldn't mind firing up!"
"115740052-0-6489";"I'm just joking around. I'm a happily married man!"
"115740052-0-6490";"Can't trust those Redguards."
"115740052-0-6491";"They don't believe in the Alliance. Why should we?"
"115740052-0-6492";"Duchess Lakana has the duke twisted 'round her finger."
"115740052-0-6493";"Duchess Lakana brought the Redguards here!"
"115740052-0-6494";"The duchess wants to take control of Alcaire."
"115740052-0-6495";"How can we allow an armed camp outside our walls?"
"115740052-0-6496";"If the Redguards attack, the knights will protect us. Right?"
"115740052-0-6497";"What about the Orcs? What if they're in on it?"
"115740052-0-6498";"Sir Hughes won't let the castle fall."
"115740052-0-6499";"I bet Duchess Lakana enthralled the duke!"
"115740052-0-6500";"Duke Nathaniel's too enamored to see straight."
"115740052-0-6501";"Ssh! The duchess' spies could be listening."
"115740052-0-6502";"Cause trouble, and I'll call the Knights of the Flame!"
"115740052-0-6503";"I've no interest in speaking with you, outsider."
"115740052-0-6504";"Don't make me call the knights. Away with you!"
"115740052-0-6505";"Haven't seen many travelers here since the Redguards arrived."
"115740052-0-6506";"Don't let those Redguards trick you."
"115740052-0-6554";"Help! Please help me before I'm torn apart!"
"115740052-0-6555";"Help me! Help! Oh, Mara, please, please protect me."
"115740052-0-6561";"You should have gone to the camp, Crelie."
"115740052-0-6562";"Hush."
"115740052-0-6565";"Let us dance then!"
"115740052-0-6566";"Let us dance then!"
"115740052-0-6567";"Defend yourself then!"
"115740052-0-6568";"Loyalty will prevail!"
"115740052-0-6569";"Not bad."
"115740052-0-6570";"Well fought."
"115740052-0-6576";"Stormhaven is doomed! Mark my words! The Covenant will be our downfall!"
"115740052-0-6602";"I can't do this myself."
"115740052-0-6606";"You must be the rescue party. How sad."
"115740052-0-6607";"I think I can walk."
"115740052-0-6611";"Crelie?"
"115740052-0-6624";"Coward! You fear me."
"115740052-0-6625";"Dare you look me in the eye?"
"115740052-0-6628";"Scared? You should be."
"115740052-0-6629";"I despise weakness … so I despise you."
"115740052-0-6630";"Who's next?"
"115740052-0-6631";"Who dares challenge me?"
"115740052-0-6632";"Do you think you've got what it takes to defeat me?"
"115740052-0-6633";"Will nobody face me?"
"115740052-0-6634";"Show me what you've got!"
"115740052-0-6635";"Face me in the arena!"
"115740052-0-6636";"Verin. It's been some time since you left for help."
"115740052-0-6637";"There! Let us go."
"115740052-0-6642";"Kill it quickly before it gets us both!"
"115740052-0-6643";"Thank you! I'll see you back at the mill."
"115740052-0-6644";"Where's Marcel?"
"115740052-0-6652";"I've waited my whole life for a find like this."
"115740052-0-6653";"Yes, I sacrificed my men! So what?"
"115740052-0-6654";"I wanted immortality! What man doesn't?"
"115740052-0-6664";"You. The one who took my daughter's life. We have much to discuss, you and I."
"115740052-0-6665";"These mortal trappings mean nothing! There is no hope for any of you!"
"115740052-0-6666";"The Remnant … it's cracking. You did it!"
"115740052-0-6671";"I'll put these flames out!"
"115740052-0-6675";"Thanks to your bravery, the heirs of Suturah are dead."
"115740052-0-6685";"Are you my next victim?"
"115740052-0-6687";"Crelie! Goodbye!"
"115740052-0-6688";"Bad dreams? Don't talk to me about dreams!"
"115740052-0-6689";"People in Stormhaven are too tense these days."
"115740052-0-6690";"Thugs in the streets! What's Wayrest coming to?"
"115740052-0-6694";"Fool! Your interference will not be tolerated!"
"115740052-0-6695";"What? Kill the intruder!"
"115740052-0-6696";"Oh, no! Help me! I've been discovered! Don't let them get me!"
"115740052-0-6697";"My head ... this pounding ... don't touch me!"
"115740052-0-6698";"My aching back!"
"115740052-0-6704";"To think it has all come to this. Curse my foolish pride!"
"115740052-0-6705";"I can feel it. The Lightless Remnants are calling me."
"115740052-0-6709";"No one will stand in Angof's way!"
"115740052-0-6710";"Don't hurt me! I didn't do anything wrong."
"115740052-0-6711";"Die, mortal! This one is chained by command of Angof!"
"115740052-0-6712";"You're too late! Verrik's already on his way to the castle! Your king is already dead!"
"115740052-0-6722";"Our best wasn't good enough. One of them got past us."
"115740052-0-6728";"For the Bloodthorn! For Angof!"
"115740052-0-6730";"What a brave king you are, Casimir. You can't hide from me!"
"115740052-0-6731";"My thanks, friend. That was too close for comfort. I'll meet you in Aldcroft."
"115740052-0-6737";"The power threatens to break free. I can feel it … the power. I could consume it. Become stronger than I ever imagined …."
"115740052-0-6740";"Isn't that magnificent? A pity House Dorrell couldn't claim this prize."
"115740052-0-6743";"screeches in anger!"
"115740052-0-6744";"<Glutton the pig squeals and runs away.>"
"115740052-0-6745";"What are you doing near that vine? Well, you won't live to reveal our secret!"
"115740052-0-6753";"What was that? Did you see something?"
"115740052-0-6761";"You need not fear my minions. They won't harm you without my say so."
"115740052-0-6765";"It worked! By Julianos, it worked. Well, that should hold the ugly cur."
"115740052-0-6766";"Take the werewolf to the cave. I'll tell Sergeant Armoil it worked."
"115740052-0-6769";"The flesh-beast caved this tunnel in! Now we're cutoff from the master."
"115740052-0-6770";"I'm going to look for a way through."
"115740052-0-6771";"Don't stray far, my pets!"
"115740052-0-6772";"To me, my pet! Come!"
"115740052-0-6773";"Ha! I can smell the fear on you."
"115740052-0-6774";"I'll meet the others there. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-6775";"Now the legendary werewolf lord shall fulfill Molag Bal's true purpose. Arise, minion. Arise from the dead!"
"115740052-0-6778";"I serve no one, Reachman!"
"115740052-0-6779";"Serve or suffer, cur. I've bound you to my will. Glenumbra's destruction is your only goal."
"115740052-0-6780";"Today I submit to you, Angof. But one day soon I will rip out your heart and eat it whole."
"115740052-0-6783";"Empty boasts from Molag Bal's newest slave. Come, Faolchu. We have business to attend to."
"115740052-0-6792";"Fools! Your Duke has been blessed with Hircine's Curse! He will destroy everything he loves."
"115740052-0-6793";"You have failed! Angof has sealed your fate."
"115740052-0-6802";"She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault."
"115740052-0-6803";"If anyone can translate that tome, it will be Veraya. But we must remain on our guard."
"115740052-0-6804";"It is needed. Take the blood to Xane, and we can begin."
"115740052-0-6805";"Got him! No, no I haven't. Mudcrabs. Now we need another werewolf."
"115740052-0-6806";"They cannot even begin to comprehend what we've found. To think this power has laid dormant for centuries!"
"115740052-0-6811";"Guard, gather the troops! Seal off the docks! No one gets past us. No one!"
"115740052-0-6812";"The Dreamer has awakened,\nHis former wrath abhorred\nWith Reason's grace\nDishonor chased\nAnd Hosni's house restored."
"115740052-0-6831";"It's true! Faolchu was tall as a tree, with claws like greatswords."
"115740052-0-6832";"Yes, yes. And he breathed fire and ate warriors, armor and all. I've heard it all before."
"115740052-0-6833";"Now we may finally learn how Faolchu was defeated."
"115740052-0-6834";"And maybe we'll find out how tall the horker really was."
"115740052-0-6837";"Crelie? I'm all right now. Could you untie me?"
"115740052-0-6850";"Gods! I feel it burning within me!"
"115740052-0-6851";"What is this? I've never felt such pain!"
"115740052-0-6852";"I'm glad you're helping Alexia. Will you aid me as well?"
"115740052-0-6857";"These stones belong to Angof now!"
"115740052-0-6874";"The spirits of Westtry belong to me!"
"115740052-0-6875";"IGNORE THIS FOR NOW, AUDIO"
"115740052-0-6878";"Guard! Salute when I approach!"
"115740052-0-6879";"I hope this works!"
"115740052-0-6880";"There, I think that's done it. Come with me."
"115740052-0-6881";"Good! It worked! That's a perfectly fine ward, if I do say so myself."
"115740052-0-6882";"Sebastian? What are you doing? No!"
"115740052-0-6883";"Father? No, get away from me!"
"115740052-0-6885";"Er, I think that time I overdid it. Let's find another one."
"115740052-0-6886";"They say Camlorn is overrun with werewolves."
"115740052-0-6887";"They found a dead beggar with his throat torn out."
"115740052-0-6888";"The guards seem nervous. I wonder what's going on."
"115740052-0-6889";"You're liable to see all types in Daggerfall."
"115740052-0-6890";"More people are disappearing in the woods."
"115740052-0-6891";"Pray to the Eight that the troubles don't find you, too."
"115740052-0-6892";"I came here expecting things to be better."
"115740052-0-6893";"The city is clean. I'll admit that much."
"115740052-0-6894";"I found a strange vine in my garden the other day."
"115740052-0-6895";"Better get inside before it gets too late."
"115740052-0-6896";"Blood and sand! This city is a maze!"
"115740052-0-6897";"They say the dead are walking again in the north."
"115740052-0-6898";"The swineherd's prize pig got loose again."
"115740052-0-6899";"The Hare and Dragon Inn has good ale."
"115740052-0-6900";"D'you think the Lion Guard would have me?"
"115740052-0-6901";"Bah. Breton cities. Too many Bretons, not enough armorers."
"115740052-0-6903";"If I could choose any trade, I'd be a smith!"
"115740052-0-6904";"King Casimir is a fine king, but Emerich is better."
"115740052-0-6909";"Seems like everyone's looking over their shoulders these days."
"115740052-0-6910";"I've had no trade with Camlorn since it was attacked."
"115740052-0-6911";"I've heard stories of Gravesingers here in Glenumbra."
"115740052-0-6912";"The servants are fearful of being on the streets after dark."
"115740052-0-6913";"Kareem makes the most beautiful gowns!"
"115740052-0-6914";"I heard we haven't had lumber shipments for days."
"115740052-0-6915";"I should have stayed in Sentinel."
"115740052-0-6916";"Lerineaux must have every one of his ships docked here today."
"115740052-0-6917";"The Casimir bloodline could do with some Redguard influence."
"115740052-0-6918";"I met a Beldama wyrd once. She cured my gout."
"115740052-0-6919";"It's a comfort to have the Lion Guard here."
"115740052-0-6920";"The docks are packed with strange crates."
"115740052-0-6931";"For House Deleyn!"
"115740052-0-6932";"For the kingdom of Daggerfall!"
"115740052-0-6933";"For the knights of the king!"
"115740052-0-6934";"In the name of the king!"
"115740052-0-6935";"Honor and steel!"
"115740052-0-6937";"For the knights of the king!"
"115740052-0-6938";"In the name of Casimir!"
"115740052-0-6939";"Honor and steel!"
"115740052-0-6940";"May the mist of the bog never blind you."
"115740052-0-6941";"Sometimes, all it takes to turn good into evil is the passage of time."
"115740052-0-6942";"A flower has no more virtue than mud or decay."
"115740052-0-6944";"I serve Daggerfall, as do we all."
"115740052-0-6945";"The Covenant is ours to shepherd."
"115740052-0-6948";"Speak to Helene. There are still questions that require answers."
"115740052-0-6956";"Go to the crypt. I'll meet you there and show you how to discover the secret you seek."
"115740052-0-6958";"How dare you enter my bog. Begone or suffer the consequences."
"115740052-0-6961";"I will suck your strength from your bones!"
"115740052-0-6962";"You'll never recover the Ansei Wards!"
"115740052-0-6963";"Stand back, your Majesty! I'm not sure how the Vault will react!"
"115740052-0-6964";"I hope this works …"
"115740052-0-6965";"It worked! Go quickly. I don't know how long it will stay open!"
"115740052-0-6972";"At last, the chains of corruption fall away! We are free of Angof's hold!"
"115740052-0-6973";"Speak, champion of the guardians. We are in your debt."
"115740052-0-6974";"Leon! Leon, are you here?"
"115740052-0-6975";"I forsake the mercy of Stendarr and deliver myself to you, Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-6976";"What? Molag Bal? Leon, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-6977";"I will not condone this madness!"
"115740052-0-6978";"Rosalind?"
"115740052-0-6979";"No! What have I done? Rosalind! Please!"
"115740052-0-6991";"Captain Rosalind! Over here, by the well!"
"115740052-0-6993";"Muriel's poultice should do the trick. Now get back into the fight!"
"115740052-0-6995";"About time you returned."
"115740052-0-6996";"We make our final stand here. The Alessians are rabble and their numbers mean nothing. This land is ours and we intend to keep it."
"115740052-0-6997";"Today Faolchu and the Alessians meet their end at our hands. Today we celebrate our victory!"
"115740052-0-6999";"Captain … Faolchu's headquarters. We were ambushed … surrounded. Alana and the others …."
"115740052-0-7000";"The armor has shattered!"
"115740052-0-7001";"<The dog whines and stops following you.>"
"115740052-0-7002";"Is everyone all right in here?"
"115740052-0-7003";"Fire! That tent is on fire!"
"115740052-0-7004";"Hmm. It must have burned itself out."
"115740052-0-7005";"Is it over?"
"115740052-0-7006";"How did I get here?"
"115740052-0-7007";"Is this rage not my own?"
"115740052-0-7008";"I have nothing to say to you, Leon."
"115740052-0-7009";"Keep your distance, husband. Just stay away."
"115740052-0-7010";"I don't think I can ever forgive him."
"115740052-0-7011";"Everything will be all right, Leon."
"115740052-0-7013";"It's finally over. Westtry is free."
"115740052-0-7014";"The nightmare has ended. We're free."
"115740052-0-7019";"Your puny weapons are no match for my fangs and claws."
"115740052-0-7020";"I'm glad you're here to protect us, Captain Rosalind."
"115740052-0-7021";"Rosalind! Thank Mara you're here."
"115740052-0-7022";"Westtry will survive, thanks to you Captain Rosalind."
"115740052-0-7023";"No! Not fire!"
"115740052-0-7024";"Have you come to liberate us? Ascend, emerge, and let us speak."
"115740052-0-7027";"By my blood, the corruption is washed away."
"115740052-0-7028";"The oasis is usually so safe!"
"115740052-0-7029";"Thank you! The poison … it burned …."
"115740052-0-7030";"I tried to run, but their strikes were so fast!"
"115740052-0-7031";"Without your aid, we'd be slaves. Forced by the Bloodthorns to smite our own descendants."
"115740052-0-7032";"Even kings may bend a knee to those they honor. Release us to our final rest."
"115740052-0-7033";"Back away! This ship is off-limits."
"115740052-0-7034";"Once again, the Iron King's flame will burn those who try to steal his blade."
"115740052-0-7035";"Once more, the pride of the Golden Prince protects his treasures."
"115740052-0-7036";"Once more, the Ivory Lord's tusk defends his treasures."
"115740052-0-7037";"Once more, the Green Aegis defends its lady's resting place."
"115740052-0-7041";"You dare challenge me, knave? Then face my wrath!"
"115740052-0-7042";"Weaklings! I have a wolf's claws and a wolf's heart. You can't prevail against me!"
"115740052-0-7045";"You got what you deserved, wench!"
"115740052-0-7046";"You betrayed us first!"
"115740052-0-7047";"You're a fool, Zariya, even in death!"
"115740052-0-7048";"Hillid the Blade, you cowardly liar!"
"115740052-0-7049";"Show yourself!"
"115740052-0-7050";"Islaif the Highwayman, you dirty dog!"
"115740052-0-7051";"Thadret, being your sister was my greatest dishonor. You disgust me!"
"115740052-0-7052";"Someone approaches. Worry not, my dove!"
"115740052-0-7053";"Please don't get bruised again, dear."
"115740052-0-7054";"Wait! I need to talk to you!"
"115740052-0-7055";"Move out, troops! Camlorn will be ours once more!"
"115740052-0-7057";"That was strange. What just happened?"
"115740052-0-7058";"Why did you do that? What was that odd light?"
"115740052-0-7059";"That was such a strange sensation."
"115740052-0-7060";"What was that about?"
"115740052-0-7061";"You better not have put a hex on me!"
"115740052-0-7063";"Eat Magicka, you rotting husk."
"115740052-0-7064";"Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-7067";"You have a deal, Bloodthorn. I will take the girl."
"115740052-0-7088";"Citizens, your courage and loyalty are legendary!"
"115740052-0-7089";"That is why we, the soldiers of the Lion Guard, have come to you."
"115740052-0-7090";"We care not for your past or your station, only the courage for which you are famed!"
"115740052-0-7091";"Join us! Teach these Dominion dogs to fear a true Breton!"
"115740052-0-7092";"Join the Lion Guard. For the Covenant! For King Casimir! For the High King!"
"115740052-0-7093";"I brought the hawthorn berries you need."
"115740052-0-7094";"Here, this poultice should help. Stay strong. Have you seen Leon by any chance?"
"115740052-0-7095";"Rest easy, soldier. I need to check on Leon."
"115740052-0-7102";"Stay close and let my power flow over you."
"115740052-0-7103";"When I call, come to me. My power shall protect you."
"115740052-0-7104";"I shall tell you when to return to my side. If you are close, I can shield you from the spirit's attacks."
"115740052-0-7105";"The tide of battle turns! To my side, now!"
"115740052-0-7106";"The winds of battle turn against you! Come here and I shall protect you!"
"115740052-0-7107";"The spirit casts a spell that shall shake the very ground beneath you! To my side, now!"
"115740052-0-7108";"It is defeated."
"115740052-0-7109";"What's this? You're not my idiot descendant. You're not even a member of my family!"
"115740052-0-7122";"Ah, the witch's puppet has come! Time to end your interference once and for all!"
"115740052-0-7123";"Destroy this foulness! Set the Wyrd Tree free!"
"115740052-0-7128";"I may try my luck at gro-Ram's. With luck, I'll make enough gold to leave Bergama."
"115740052-0-7133";"Warrgh!"
"115740052-0-7151";"Run, stranger. I can't hold back Lord Velian's wraith."
"115740052-0-7152";"You're too late. Sellan's soul will power my magic."
"115740052-0-7154";"No. I will not be denied."
"115740052-0-7166";"Back to the desert, nomads!"
"115740052-0-7167";"He's dishonored the family name!"
"115740052-0-7168";"It's just like the Forebears to insult our traditions."
"115740052-0-7169";"His desert blood is an affront to our heritage."
"115740052-0-7170";"Tiela's prudish ways sickened Casnar. I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-7171";"Say something bad about Casnar again. I dare you!"
"115740052-0-7172";"If something happened to him, the Crowns will pay!"
"115740052-0-7173";"Stuck up prig! She's not worthy of his affections!"
"115740052-0-7175";"Begone, Angof. I did your bidding. This city is mine now."
"115740052-0-7176";"You are still my creature, slave. I made you."
"115740052-0-7177";"I devoured Camlorn. All of Glenumbra will be mine!"
"115740052-0-7178";"Vain creature. The Lion Guard stands at your door. You have failed."
"115740052-0-7179";"They are weak and I will crush them. Camlorn is mine!"
"115740052-0-7180";"You dare challenge me? Prepare to feel my wrath!"
"115740052-0-7181";"Archers! There's your target. Ignite, draw back, and release!"
"115740052-0-7182";"The fire shall not destroy me again!"
"115740052-0-7183";"No! You can't kill me. Not again."
"115740052-0-7184";"One of you! Thump this ignorant trash!"
"115740052-0-7185";"screams in agony."
"115740052-0-7186";"I heard something move upstairs. Let's check it out."
"115740052-0-7198";"Listen to me! You must listen!"
"115740052-0-7200";"The sacrifice has made this holy place pure again. We can begin the ritual whenever you are ready."
"115740052-0-7202";"<The werewolf shudders, overwhelmed by the containment magic.>"
"115740052-0-7203";"We're leaving Merovec's Folly. I'll wait for you on the road."
"115740052-0-7204";"Here goes nothing."
"115740052-0-7209";"It's done! But something's not right."
"115740052-0-7217";"I see you, little mortal."
"115740052-0-7218";"I've guarded this talisman for untold centuries. And you hope to purge me from it? Never!"
"115740052-0-7219";"I will personally send you back to Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-7220";"You seek to see into the past. I can guide you."
"115740052-0-7221";"I can show you how Faolchu met his death."
"115740052-0-7222";"If Faolchu has risen, then he must die again."
"115740052-0-7223";"howls with rage!"
"115740052-0-7225";"I liked you, friend. I did. I'm sorry it had to come to this."
"115740052-0-7226";"Hey, this works."
"115740052-0-7232";"There you are, my love. I was starting to worry about you."
"115740052-0-7233";"We're so close to defeating the Alessians. Despite the odds, I think we're finally going to win."
"115740052-0-7234";"You fight like a lion. Always have. What a sight! I never tire of watching you, my love."
"115740052-0-7236";"Do what you have to do and find those orders. Then find me at camp. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-7237";"It can't end like this! Not like this!"
"115740052-0-7238";"Use the fire. Faolchu's afraid of the flames."
"115740052-0-7239";"Fool! You may have destroyed one of my slaves, but I have so many more."
"115740052-0-7243";"How nice of you to come see us. We don't have visitors very often."
"115740052-0-7244";"laughs at you."
"115740052-0-7245";"Where do you think you're going?"
"115740052-0-7246";"For the King of Worms!"
"115740052-0-7247";"Angof will pay for this insult!"
"115740052-0-7248";"What do we have here? A real hero, it seems."
"115740052-0-7249";"People of Bergama, we are gathered today to witness the bond of marriage between Casnar and Tiela."
"115740052-0-7250";"Their union marks a great day for the citizens of Bergama, Crowns and Forebears alike."
"115740052-0-7251";"Their love is a testament to the kinship that all Crowns and Forebears share with each other."
"115740052-0-7256";"I do."
"115740052-0-7262";"With blade, a king defeats his enemies. In flames, a kingdom is forged. Through strife, a king prevails."
"115740052-0-7263";"They took the prince! Down the path! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-7264";"That way! They went that way!"
"115740052-0-7265";"You have passed the Trial of Kings. The vault shall open."
"115740052-0-7266";"Yes! That's it! One of these ripples you've created must lead to the doorway!"
"115740052-0-7268";"You cannot kill what is already dead!"
"115740052-0-7269";"Approach the vault. I will speak to you there."
"115740052-0-7271";"The prince! Someone help! They took him!"
"115740052-0-7274";"begins summoning skeletons!"
"115740052-0-7275";"My king ... I await you beyond the veil."
"115740052-0-7277";"The trap is sprung! Now we move on Koeglin Village. See if you can keep our quarry occupied, my dear."
"115740052-0-7278";"Where are you going?"
"115740052-0-7279";"Fine. I'm heading back to the tower."
"115740052-0-7280";"It shall be done, my king. The mortal will have a taste of death."
"115740052-0-7281";"Gennove makes a good point, but I think I can help. Come talk to me when you have a moment."
"115740052-0-7282";"Tormented souls of the dead arise and kill these interlopers!"
"115740052-0-7288";"I'm here. Talk to me when you're ready to check on the Hinault family."
"115740052-0-7303";"Please … you must hurry!"
"115740052-0-7308";"I'll have you free in no time, my love."
"115740052-0-7309";"Thank you, my sweet."
"115740052-0-7310";"Get the injured inside. Anyone who can still stand, guard the doors."
"115740052-0-7313";"Stand close. The wraith is preparing a large attack!"
"115740052-0-7316";"Now take the cursed crown to the noble and set me free."
"115740052-0-7318";"I've waited for freedom for so long, I don't know what I'll do with it."
"115740052-0-7321";"Someone should check on the Hinaults."
"115740052-0-7323";"Mama ... no!"
"115740052-0-7324";"Marrec! No!"
"115740052-0-7337";"Participant added."
"115740052-0-7338";"Participant removed."
"115740052-0-7342";"Have you come to meddle, as well? I could always use more corpses!"
"115740052-0-7343";"Your bones will make an excellent throne."
"115740052-0-7353";"No! No, don't! What ... who are you?"
"115740052-0-7354";"I won't let you! Wait. You're not a bloodfiend."
"115740052-0-7358";"It's time for you to go back now."
"115740052-0-7359";"Over here, friend!"
"115740052-0-7363";"You're making a grave error."
"115740052-0-7382";"You are unworthy of the treasure of Dresan Keep!"
"115740052-0-7384";"Who is it? Who comes to these ancient corridors after all these years?"
"115740052-0-7395";"Stay back, foul creature!"
"115740052-0-7396";"Monster? What did I …?"
"115740052-0-7397";"She's a bloodfiend! She entered our farmhouse and killed our father!"
"115740052-0-7398";"No! That can't be true!"
"115740052-0-7399";"They've broken into the vault. Stop them, fools!"
"115740052-0-7400";"Enough! Get the Ansei Wards out, now!"
"115740052-0-7401";"The Ansei Wards are ours, fool! Soon, all Alik'r will fall!"
"115740052-0-7412";"Who dares trespass in my city? Find them. Kill them. Bring me their bones!"
"115740052-0-7415";"Keep watch. I won't be long."
"115740052-0-7416";"I lit the signal fire. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-7417";"The Orc I know and love would never utter such words."
"115740052-0-7418";"Nura? Is it really you? It's been so long."
"115740052-0-7419";"We've suffered enough of this curse."
"115740052-0-7420";"I'll head back to the inn. Good luck fighting Faolchu!"
"115740052-0-7421";"By the grace of Mara, I've been allowed to take you beyond this mortal realm."
"115740052-0-7422";"Finally, a release from the suffering of this world."
"115740052-0-7423";"Come, my love. We have the rest of eternity to be together."
"115740052-0-7424";"That's the signal. Lion Guard, charge!"
"115740052-0-7430";"Don't let up. Quickly, now. More fire!"
"115740052-0-7431";"Set fire to the entire building. For Camlorn!"
"115740052-0-7432";"Make the beast pay. Archers, more fire!"
"115740052-0-7434";"There's too much activity in these ruins as of late."
"115740052-0-7469";"We will meet again."
"115740052-0-7491";"You did it! Wings of Akatosh, what was that thing?"
"115740052-0-7498";"This town belongs to the Red Rooks now!"
"115740052-0-7502";"Thank you, champion."
"115740052-0-7510";"This is the Hinault Farmhouse. Why don't you go up and see if anyone is home?"
"115740052-0-7516";"We must consider negotiation, my son."
"115740052-0-7517";"To the dogs with that! Hira has killed my mother—he killed your wife!"
"115740052-0-7518";"What you say is true. But many more wives and sisters will die if we take up the sword."
"115740052-0-7519";"This cave has made a coward of you! We must fight!"
"115740052-0-7523";"You're a fool, Merien. I will use your son as my tool, as I used you."
"115740052-0-7524";"The Goblins approach, my lord. They will slaughter our scouts!"
"115740052-0-7525";"Many of our noblest warriors will be slain! How can you turn your back to them?"
"115740052-0-7526";"We must hold this pass or the war is lost. Their sacrifice will be remembered always."
"115740052-0-7527";"The blades are forbidden! We must not use them!"
"115740052-0-7528";"Taking up those blades may lead to something far worse than death!"
"115740052-0-7529";"Without them, our people—our civilization—will die."
"115740052-0-7533";"I spent my early years as a Maiden of the Spirit Blade…"
"115740052-0-7534";"As early … as early as I can …"
"115740052-0-7535";"… remember…"
"115740052-0-7539";"I think I can walk. I'm going to return to the house and make sure everyone is all right."
"115740052-0-7540";"Good luck, friend. You're always welcome in my home."
"115740052-0-7543";"Who rang the bell? Is there a cave-in? You! Get away from that bell!"
"115740052-0-7545";"You may have beaten my guards, but you can't defeat me."
"115740052-0-7548";"You'll die for interfering with the Red Rooks!"
"115740052-0-7579";"I'll protect you as best I can."
"115740052-0-7587";"Let's see how you handle a cave-in."
"115740052-0-7588";"Quickly now, before Angof knows we're here."
"115740052-0-7589";"Stay close. You have to keep them away from me until I complete the ritual."
"115740052-0-7597";"We did it! Come on. Let's get inside before anything else tries to stop us!"
"115740052-0-7599";"Wait, are you leaving?"
"115740052-0-7613";"Treachery! Soldiers, clear those abominations but leave the necromancer!"
"115740052-0-7614";"Fool. You will learn what happens when you interfere with the Withered Hand."
"115740052-0-7615";"That damned dog keeps approaching me. I think it wants me to follow it."
"115740052-0-7616";"I know why you have come here. I'm prepared to offer you aid."
"115740052-0-7617";"Mauloch's teeth, I hate dogs. Someone needs to get rid of the creature."
"115740052-0-7618";"I saw harpies carry someone off to the north!"
"115740052-0-7619";"Seems as though someone took care of those harpies."
"115740052-0-7620";"I saw smoke off toward Deleyn's Mill. Something terrible must have happened there."
"115740052-0-7621";"Did you hear what happened at Deleyn's Mill? At least there were some survivors."
"115740052-0-7622";"This is terrible! I heard the Red Rook bandits have completely stopped all trade."
"115740052-0-7623";"Really? Could mean more work for me, if traveling merchants need guards."
"115740052-0-7633";"The dog probably wants a handout, like half the peasants in the city. At least a dog won't bite the hand that feeds it."
"115740052-0-7634";"Did you hear? Some stranger saved King Casimir's life."
"115740052-0-7635";"Really? Who was it?"
"115740052-0-7636";"Really? Who was it? Any idea where the stranger came from? I'd like to buy that hero an ale!"
"115740052-0-7640";"No campfire smoke. That means no fresh supplies … or not many soldiers to cook for."
"115740052-0-7641";"Either way, that's good news for us. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-7643";"There aren't many Imperials patrolling the walls. Not enough."
"115740052-0-7644";"They can't properly garrison the fortress. Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-7646";"Their pickets are poorly organized. I see big gaps in their patrol patterns."
"115740052-0-7647";"Maybe their commander is just lacking in experience. We need more information."
"115740052-0-7649";"He's down! Hold onto him! Tie him up!"
"115740052-0-7650";"Good work. Take him to the tent on the camp's hill."
"115740052-0-7651";"We've learned all we can out here. Come talk to me."
"115740052-0-7663";"No, please! I cannot die!"
"115740052-0-7665";"For Crosswych!"
"115740052-0-7675";"I'll run ahead and secure the prisoner. Meet me there."
"115740052-0-7682";"I don't have anything! Please, let me go!"
"115740052-0-7683";"What happened?"
"115740052-0-7686";"Help! I've been captured!"
"115740052-0-7690";"Bertrand? Bertrand! That's simply unacceptable! A rat? Really? And just where am I supposed to find another butler all the way out here?"
"115740052-0-7695";"The Fighters Guild has shown their hand. Soldiers, kill these treacherous dogs on sight!"
"115740052-0-7705";"One moment. I must concentrate."
"115740052-0-7706";"You clever witch."
"115740052-0-7713";"We must stop Shiri."
"115740052-0-7715";"A king must tend to each of the bright flames of his kingdom equally."
"115740052-0-7716";"A king must use tactics and strategy, never risking his kingdom with reckless actions."
"115740052-0-7717";"A king must be neither too close nor too distant from those who serve his kingdom."
"115740052-0-7719";"Thank you! I can make it back to the village."
"115740052-0-7722";"So you are the vain fool who seeks to pry Glenumbra from my grasp."
"115740052-0-7723";"That's right, keep them coming. You can never destroy too many zombies."
"115740052-0-7724";"Captain Ondre, ma'am! Imperials at the east gate!"
"115740052-0-7726";"I will take the bones to the altar."
"115740052-0-7727";"The ritual has begun. Be on your guard."
"115740052-0-7728";"Leki's blade! That's Uwafa, Veraya's son. Protect me!"
"115740052-0-7729";"Almost done! Just a bit longer!"
"115740052-0-7730";"Uwafa! Your mother will never again walk the sands of Alik'r!"
"115740052-0-7731";"Rise, dead of Alik'r. Rise and tear this priestess apart!"
"115740052-0-7732";"Veraya will live again! And you shall feel her wrath!"
"115740052-0-7733";"Die, fool. Die!"
"115740052-0-7734";"No! You will not consecrate Veraya!"
"115740052-0-7735";"You ... you will pay dearly for this. You will pay with your eternal souls!"
"115740052-0-7736";"My son! No, you've killed him!"
"115740052-0-7741";"I will get <<1>> back to our allies on the other side of the camp, the miners you have freed here."
"115740052-0-7742";"You killed him, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-7747";"They're too strong! Retreat!"
"115740052-0-7749";"We have the supplies! Fall back to the garrison!"
"115740052-0-7750";"Curse you for your unkindess! I will never rest easy while my murderer lives."
"115740052-0-7754";"I'm free. Quickly, my friend. Head to the village!"
"115740052-0-7755";"Imperial raid! Protect the supplies!"
"115740052-0-7759";"What is this we have here, Larus?"
"115740052-0-7760";"A fool of course, Falco. Let's put it to work in the mines!"
"115740052-0-7762";"I am so happy! Wait … something is wrong. I feel …. Ugh!"
"115740052-0-7778";"Someone's coming. Get them!"
"115740052-0-7781";"Get out of Kerbol's Hollow, Reachmen!"
"115740052-0-7782";"An outsider's seen us. We need to run."
"115740052-0-7793";"Imperial raid! You stop the porters. I'll take care of their escorts!"
"115740052-0-7799";"You dare meddle with the Supernal Dreamers?"
"115740052-0-7802";"Taste the flames of Oblivion."
"115740052-0-7803";"Go, my minions! Slash and rend."
"115740052-0-7804";"Why won't you die?"
"115740052-0-7805";"In Vaermina's name, die."
"115740052-0-7821";"What happened? I have to get to Koeglin Villlage. Meet me there!"
"115740052-0-7826";"Where is it? Tell me!"
"115740052-0-7827";"Ahhhhh!"
"115740052-0-7829";"We've got him here. Now we need him to talk."
"115740052-0-7848";"I … didn't expect that to work."
"115740052-0-7849";"How are you doing that?"
"115740052-0-7850";"You may be on to something!"
"115740052-0-7851";"I told you it wouldn't work!"
"115740052-0-7852";"Idiot. That's how the last one got killed."
"115740052-0-7853";"You should just give up."
"115740052-0-7854";"I'm never getting out of here."
"115740052-0-7856";"Today is a good day, my friends. Our sacred guardians are restored!"
"115740052-0-7857";"The specter of undeath threatened our kingdom, our lives! The sands of the Alik'r howled with the outrage of our honored ancestors!"
"115740052-0-7858";"Now though, the spawn of Suturah are dead, and they will remain that way! The Withered Hand is scattered!"
"115740052-0-7859";"Many of you already know this, but all this was accomplished only because of this one who stands here before you."
"115740052-0-7860";"The spirit of Divad raises his blade in salute. Someday, this hero's song will be sung in the Chants of Praise."
"115740052-0-7861";"All hail our great protector! All hail the hero of the Alik'r!"
"115740052-0-7862";"The Baelbornes deserve to suffer!"
"115740052-0-7863";"They destroyed my family. Stop!"
"115740052-0-7864";"Die, meddler!"
"115740052-0-7865";"Damn you and your cold heart! I will never rest easy while that murderess lives!"
"115740052-0-7868";"Come, speak with me before you enter the Vault."
"115740052-0-7871";"Ma seate … auta! Auta!"
"115740052-0-7878";"Stibbons! Could you come and put this lovely crown away, please?"
"115740052-0-7879";"Of course, my lady."
"115740052-0-7880";"There we are, my lady. Safe and sound."
"115740052-0-7881";"No! That's not the right crown!"
"115740052-0-7882";"Why? Why isn't he bound?"
"115740052-0-7884";"You betrayed me! Betrayed me!"
"115740052-0-7886";"I'll go see about more fish for the stew, my lady."
"115740052-0-7888";"Beware! They covet this blade, and shall come for it!"
"115740052-0-7911";"Oh, dear. I seem to be dead. How very inconvenient."
"115740052-0-7912";"I feel drawn to this place now … bound to it somehow."
"115740052-0-7914";"I'm free! Er, now what?"
"115740052-0-7918";"I … I only know how to be a servant. How pathetic."
"115740052-0-7920";"Stibbons! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-7921";"I … of course, my lady. Let me just put this away for you."
"115740052-0-7928";"If you'll excuse me, my lady, I think this stew could use more fish."
"115740052-0-7929";"If you'll excuse me, my lady, I must attend to the stew."
"115740052-0-7947";"Halt. This is a restricted area."
"115740052-0-7952";"You again? I relish adding your skull to my collection!"
"115740052-0-7957";"Come to the lion's tomb!"
"115740052-0-7972";"What … no. Vaermina? No."
"115740052-0-7974";"Here we go!"
"115740052-0-7977";"May the Lady of the Lake bless you, friend!"
"115740052-0-7978";"I'll tell everyone of your kindness, stranger!"
"115740052-0-7979";"She'll make these fiends pay. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-7980";"Wait a moment, please!"
"115740052-0-7981";"NPC notifies the player that he is going to run away and depop!"
"115740052-0-7982";"Oh no! The coal! You fool!"
"115740052-0-7983";"Put it out, you idiot! Put it out!"
"115740052-0-7984";"Get clear, it's going t-"
"115740052-0-7985";"I'll wait by the waterfall. May our Lady keep you safe."
"115740052-0-7998";"Where are you going? We need to light the signal fires."
"115740052-0-8000";"I must speak with you in the tower, where the curse fell."
"115740052-0-8004";"Maurice … what is this? It's beautiful."
"115740052-0-8016";"How dare you destroy the artifacts of binding!"
"115740052-0-8017";"Soon my children. With each essence, we draw closer to the dream."
"115740052-0-8018";"We must work quickly, before the Daedric Prince's servants can stop us."
"115740052-0-8019";"We have nearly enough essences now. Tell Apostle Marian it is time to prepare."
"115740052-0-8022";"After I kill you I shall raise you up and make you my slave!"
"115740052-0-8023";"We'll do what we can to help. Just stay away from his vines."
"115740052-0-8024";"You and your friends will all die!"
"115740052-0-8025";"Get to the light, before his magic destroys you!"
"115740052-0-8026";"You did it. Now hurry! Through the portal you go!"
"115740052-0-8028";"Where are you going? This isn't the right way!"
"115740052-0-8029";"I'm heading back to camp. See you there."
"115740052-0-8030";"No! Don't kill my pack!"
"115740052-0-8036";"NPC notifies the player that he is about to run away due to leaving a subzone."
"115740052-0-8048";"Over here! Quickly, before the Imperials see you!"
"115740052-0-8055";"The Red Rooks have betrayed us! Kill the curs! Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-8056";"The Red Rooks dare betray us? Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-8063";"TEST: Protector - Over Here"
"115740052-0-8064";"TEST: Protector - Protection Taunt"
"115740052-0-8068";"You sicken me. You're finished here, Manard."
"115740052-0-8071";"No!"
"115740052-0-8097";"You obviously had something to do with this. Now die!"
"115740052-0-8101";"I'm going in - keep them away from the door."
"115740052-0-8108";"I'll free the others. Go on. Help the sergeant."
"115740052-0-8109";"There's always a hero in every town. They always come after me, and they always die!"
"115740052-0-8110";"Why are we leaving town?"
"115740052-0-8118";"Poor little thing. I'm glad we could at least ease her passing."
"115740052-0-8125";"Come talk to me."
"115740052-0-8134";"At last I've found you."
"115740052-0-8135";"Where can they have gone?"
"115740052-0-8143";"Stop! I … I won't hurt you. I have control. Use the medallion, quickly!"
"115740052-0-8144";"People of Hallin's Stand, rise up!"
"115740052-0-8145";"You don't know your own strength!"
"115740052-0-8146";"Our numbers are greater than the Imperials'."
"115740052-0-8147";"They can't stand against an army of proud Redguards!"
"115740052-0-8148";"The time for our boldest deeds has come!"
"115740052-0-8149";"Rise up! Throw down the Imperials!"
"115740052-0-8150";"Leave your couches and cups!"
"115740052-0-8151";"Set down your scrolls and shovels!"
"115740052-0-8152";"The Warrior Wave rises in your hearts!"
"115740052-0-8153";"Feel the power of Onsi's fire in your limbs!"
"115740052-0-8154";"Take up your axes! Take up your rocks!"
"115740052-0-8155";"Seius' last day has dawned!"

"115740052-0-8158";"Step forward, mortal."
"115740052-0-8164";"What pathetic creature meddles with my magic?"
"115740052-0-8165";"Quickly! Use this portal!"
"115740052-0-8166";"After that, I need to rest. Please excuse me!"
"115740052-0-8170";"Farewell."
"115740052-0-8171";"Thank you!"
"115740052-0-8172";"We're here!"
"115740052-0-8173";"Let's get going."
"115740052-0-8174";"You old goat! I ought to run your Thieves Guild out of town."
"115740052-0-8175";"I'm terribly frightened, My Lady Governor … you uptight whelp."
"115740052-0-8181";"They'll never forgive me."
"115740052-0-8182";"It's not my fault. I couldn't refuse Seius."
"115740052-0-8183";"No! I won't let them get to me."
"115740052-0-8188";"Dare you to enter my dark hole? Tear you apart, my crows will!"
"115740052-0-8195";"The Governor's not going to like this…"
"115740052-0-8202";"Well, what are you waiting for? He's down there … somewhere. Probably."
"115740052-0-8204";"I'll protect you, Mr. Curio!"
"115740052-0-8212";"Can anyone hear me? Help me!"
"115740052-0-8213";"Let us find <<1>> soon, for I fear what he will do without supervision."
"115740052-0-8214";"Such a pity I hadn't unearthed this place initially. Could you imagine the fame?"

"115740052-0-8239";"Vandal! Destroying my art, you will regret!"
"115740052-0-8261";"Be prepared for action!"

"115740052-0-8274";"The flag has been stripped and returned!"
"115740052-0-8303";"Ha! I'm not leaving the city. Got better things to do than follow you out there."
"115740052-0-8306";"Mine! Hungry!"
"115740052-0-8307";"They're using the ravens to communicate … but with whom?"

"115740052-0-8315";"Fight my illusions! You'll never determine which spirit is truly mine!"
"115740052-0-8316";"That was … a lucky guess …."
"115740052-0-8317";"You have ended me but doomed Rivenspire! Let the power of the Remnant burst free!"
"115740052-0-8318";"You will face one of my prized beasts!"
"115740052-0-8319";"My lion will make short work of you!"
"115740052-0-8331";"No! I can't give in to this temptation. I must remove the Remnant from this place … take it to the plane of my master. We need to talk … one last time."
"115740052-0-8334";"You dare turn my own magic against me?"
"115740052-0-8341";"I will free them, you can count on me."

"115740052-0-8387";"We're here."
"115740052-0-8392";"That feels better. Did an Argonian make this?"
"115740052-0-8393";"An Argonian savage made this?"
"115740052-0-8394";"Think, traveler. Do you want to meet your ancestors today?"
"115740052-0-8397";"No. You'll destroy us all!"
"115740052-0-8398";"I need your help again."
"115740052-0-8403";"Thanks! I'll spread the warning of the Worm Cult!"

"115740052-0-8413";"Fool. You think to tame the coral?"
"115740052-0-8414";"I'll see you dead."
"115740052-0-8415";"The coral must listen. Be still."
"115740052-0-8416";"No. She has the coral heart. Quickly, inside. Stop her!"
"115740052-0-8420";"Fall back! Fall back!"
"115740052-0-8421";"Retreat!"
"115740052-0-8424";"The Covenant have Galyn … she's on their ship. Help her. Please!"
"115740052-0-8425";"You're too late. The heart is mine!"
"115740052-0-8426";"You won't burn? Then freeze!"
"115740052-0-8427";"Have a taste of lightning!"
"115740052-0-8428";"You found Girvas' hatchling? Good."
"115740052-0-8429";"I've caught you bloody-handed, Argonian!"
"115740052-0-8430";"Morvani, are you … Lord, Mother, and Wizard! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-8431";"Hold on Morvani. I've got you."
"115740052-0-8434";"Not for long."
"115740052-0-8435";"Conele! Run while you can."
"115740052-0-8436";"You've arrived, so let's begin."
"115740052-0-8437";"Let's see if we can put these spirits to rest."
"115740052-0-8438";"The fallen will not be disturbed!"
"115740052-0-8439";"You've meddled enough."
"115740052-0-8440";"Why do you defile the dead?"
"115740052-0-8441";"Fear the fury of the unliving!"
"115740052-0-8442";"By your bones, I compel you! Serve us, spirits!"
"115740052-0-8443";"Fool! You don't have the power to compel me."
"115740052-0-8444";"Lead your men to the lands beyond! Begone!"
"115740052-0-8445";"You won't stop me. The Coral Heart is mine!"
"115740052-0-8448";"An imposter! He's stolen the sacred book!"
"115740052-0-8450";"A word with you. Over here. Away from the brothers."
"115740052-0-8454";"Let's get going."
"115740052-0-8455";"The Covenant's been bombarding the city for days."
"115740052-0-8456";"If Davon's Watch falls, all of Stonefalls is in danger."
"115740052-0-8457";"I came to fight with my old comrade, Tanval."
"115740052-0-8458";"Poor bastard. Didn't even get a soldier's death."
"115740052-0-8459";"Damned Covenant! Will this bombardment ever stop?"
"115740052-0-8463";"Commander Holgunn."
"115740052-0-8464";"I have duties with my father. Fight well."
"115740052-0-8467";"Who dares to challenge Gruznak?"
"115740052-0-8469";"I'll have your head, runt!"
"115740052-0-8473";"Get ready, we'll leave in just a moment."
"115740052-0-8475";"What? I'll add your skull to that pile, meddler!"
"115740052-0-8476";"You've done it. Come speak to me."
"115740052-0-8477";"Thank you for bringing me here. I appreciate it."
"115740052-0-8478";"appears to have been trapped!"
"115740052-0-8483";"Defend me while I perform the ritual."
"115740052-0-8484";"From the depths of Ash Mountain, Balreth, I summon you!"
"115740052-0-8485";"You face a Nord now, scum! Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-8487";"Destroy the Covenant army!"
"115740052-0-8496";"When are the guards going to do something about our missing people?"
"115740052-0-8497";"I assure you, we're doing everything we can. We're stretched thin as it is, but …."
"115740052-0-8498";"Excuses! When your family disappears, what excuse will you use then? I'll find them myself. Just stay out of my way!"
"115740052-0-8500";"Father said the Akaviri War was like this."
"115740052-0-8501";"Such senseless death and destruction."
"115740052-0-8514";"Did you hear? Wild dogs have filled the streets of Camlorn. It's like an epidemic!"
"115740052-0-8515";"No, that's not the way I heard it. It's werewolves! They've taken over the city! Duke Sebastien must have angered the Daedric prince Hircine himself!"
"115740052-0-8516";"Werewolves? Well, that's certainly more interesting than wild dogs. But a lot more dangerous, too. I think I'm going to avoid that area for the foreseeable future."
"115740052-0-8517";"A dead werewolf brought back to life? Am I really expected to believe that such a thing is possible?"
"115740052-0-8518";"I know how it sounds, but it's true! Someone did what the Lion Guard couldn't and saved the city."
"115740052-0-8519";"I'm just happy that Camlorn is safe. A baker there makes the best bread! It's warm and cheesy and delicious."
"115740052-0-8520";"You mean Olwaf? I heard he was one of the people turned into a werewolf. He's all right now, but I'm not sure I'd be rushing to get a loaf of his bread anytime soon."
"115740052-0-8521";"My goodness! How right you are! Who wants fur in their warm loaf of cheesy bread?"
"115740052-0-8522";"is trapped!"
"115740052-0-8523";"Please, no more."
"115740052-0-8524";"Divines! Someone help me."
"115740052-0-8525";"I don't even know what you want."
"115740052-0-8528";"And that's why we should seal the city. We can't allow more afflicted into Narsis."
"115740052-0-8529";"That makes perfect sense, old friend, but we can't cut ourselves off from the outside world."
"115740052-0-8530";"If you truly care about our people, you'll seal Narsis and be done with it. We can't take any more chances."
"115740052-0-8531";"There's my brave pantsless warrior. Do you remember anything from last night?"
"115740052-0-8532";"<You hear screaming.>"
"115740052-0-8533";"I heard that Dominion soldiers have landed at Farwatch. Can you tell me anything else?"
"115740052-0-8534";"Not much. The Elves landed and there's been fighting throughout the area."
"115740052-0-8537";"My daughter is stationed there! I hope she's all right."
"115740052-0-8538";"You're looking into matters that don't concern you, outsider."
"115740052-0-8546";"Ha! Now you feed the buzzards with us, Amil!"
"115740052-0-8550";"You think you can take the little branch from Marra'var? Think again, you clawless cur!"
"115740052-0-8556";"An invader in our camp? You'll die for this!"
"115740052-0-8558";"There you are, my sweet, uh, briarheart. I battled a witch last night."
"115740052-0-8559";"Who has rung bell and woken Sa'dir? Who has made me fall from my high place?"
"115740052-0-8560";"Was she frightened off by your nakedness? Put some pants on, you sot!"
"115740052-0-8562";"You persist in annoying me. You are as irritating as a marsh fly."
"115740052-0-8563";"Arise, slave, and destroy my enemies!"
"115740052-0-8564";"In Molag Bal's name, I call you forth!"
"115740052-0-8565";"Quickly, now! Aid me!"
"115740052-0-8566";"You will not defeat me! Attack, slaves!"
"115740052-0-8567";"Come, my children. Aid me!"
"115740052-0-8568";"Begone, outsider. This is not your affair."
"115740052-0-8569";"You are to blame for all this. You and your foolish mate."
"115740052-0-8570";"You will all pay for your disrespect! I will have my revenge!"
"115740052-0-8573";"No! My army isn't complete! You won't destroy my slaves!"
"115740052-0-8574";"Here to steal our loot, eh? Get em, lads!"
"115740052-0-8575";"No! The Hist calls to me. Pulls me back!"
"115740052-0-8576";"Father! I've brought the head of the Goblin Warlord!"
"115740052-0-8578";"No."
"115740052-0-8579";"We've got to kill the Goblin Warlord and the spider queen while we have the chance. Follow me."
"115740052-0-8597";"Keep your eyes open. The Goblins could attack at any moment."
"115740052-0-8598";"Defend the hall! Slay the Goblins!"
"115740052-0-8599";"By Ysgramor, we've won the day."
"115740052-0-8600";"It's you! Huzzah!"
"115740052-0-8603";"The hero of Daggerfall! I'm honored!"
"115740052-0-8604";"Hey, you saved the King!"
"115740052-0-8605";"Look, it's the hero who saved King Casimir!"
"115740052-0-8606";"Have you heard from your brother out at the farms?"
"115740052-0-8608";"Your presence has aroused the Serpentbound!"
"115740052-0-8609";"They send you into the heart once more, then?"
"115740052-0-8610";"If you wish my aid, I'll be here."
"115740052-0-8611";"It's this way."
"115740052-0-8616";"Hop right in. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe."
"115740052-0-8620";"I will see this done, no matter what the cost."
"115740052-0-8621";"Hold! Hold there, sera!"
"115740052-0-8622";"Please! I've told you everything I know!"
"115740052-0-8623";"One more lie, and I make you stop talking. Permanently. Understand?"
"115740052-0-8624";"This is the first part of the conversation!"
"115740052-0-8627";"Stay out of my way. You've been warned."
"115740052-0-8636";"Um, could I have that letter back? I'd really appreciate it."
"115740052-0-8642";"You're going to get it now!"
"115740052-0-8643";"You're not welcome here, Dark Elf."
"115740052-0-8644";"Sleeeeeeep."
"115740052-0-8655";"Welcome to Sentinel City!"
"115740052-0-8660";"Why do I always drop things when I'm in a hurry?"
"115740052-0-8661";"Not here. Just look in the pack."
"115740052-0-8662";"If these problems persist in Sentinel, I think I'll consider moving away."
"115740052-0-8663";"Where would you go?"
"115740052-0-8664";"I don't know. There's too much destruction here. I need beauty in my life."
"115740052-0-8665";"Have you considered the comfort of Dibella?"
"115740052-0-8666";"Of course not! I follow Morwha, not the idle worship of vain women."
"115740052-0-8667";"There is neither death nor destruction if all you choose to see is yourself. Dibella has taught us this lesson."
"115740052-0-8668";"I'm looking for solace, not self-satisfaction. You can keep your cult to yourself."
"115740052-0-8669";"Fair enough. But don't cry to me about ugliness when I've offered you a chance to escape."
"115740052-0-8672";"We've already talked about this, Sadal. We have no choice."
"115740052-0-8676";"House Hlaalu wants us to believe that our friends and family left Narsis without saying a word."
"115740052-0-8677";"But we have proof that they were abducted. And what does Hlaalu do? Nothing! They seal Narsis and refuse to let us act."
"115740052-0-8678";"No more waiting! We'll save them ourselves. We'll bring the abducted villagers home!"
"115740052-0-8679";"What's that noise? Rats! They have the plague! Run!"
"115740052-0-8680";"Have you tasted the water lately?"
"115740052-0-8681";"Of course I have. I'm not a camel."
"115740052-0-8682";"Did it taste funny to you?"
"115740052-0-8683";"I don't think water can taste anything but bad in the desert."
"115740052-0-8684";"I mean, more than usual? Almost like sulfur, but fouler. Almost like death."
"115740052-0-8685";"Ha, is that so? Have you tasted death, my friend?"
"115740052-0-8686";"No, and I hope I never have to anytime soon. I hope the water isn't rancid."
"115740052-0-8687";"Maybe the king is feeding us from the Tears of the Dishonored."
"115740052-0-8688";"Nothing strengthens a king's rule like a panic."
"115740052-0-8689";"And nothing overthrows a king quite like a water shortage."
"115740052-0-8690";"Let's hope he cleans up the Rain Catchers soon, then. There's enough unrest in this land as it is."
"115740052-0-8691";"I've started seeing more Orcs in our desert as of late."
"115740052-0-8692";"Aye. Ugly folk, they are."
"115740052-0-8693";"That's an understatement. I wish they would stick to their lands."
"115740052-0-8694";"We're allies with them now. There's nothing we can do about it."
"115740052-0-8695";"As long as I don't have to speak with them, I guess I can tolerate it."
"115740052-0-8696";"Better be careful, friend. Given your appearance, they might mistake you for one of their own."
"115740052-0-8697";"I'd rather be confused with an Orc than a Breton. You can smell the magic on them."
"115740052-0-8698";"Oh yeah? And what does that smell like?"
"115740052-0-8699";"Cowardice. And rotten cheese."
"115740052-0-8700";"Do you see the signs I see?"
"115740052-0-8701";"What're you talking about?"
"115740052-0-8702";"The signs of war. The Crowns say they're everywhere, if you look hard enough."
"115740052-0-8703";"You mean those backward, frightened fools?"
"115740052-0-8704";"They're not fools. They've seen the signs of the gods. Onsi is preparing us for war.."
"115740052-0-8705";"Typical Crown talk. Sitting around, waiting for the gods to intervene."
"115740052-0-8706";"Well, what have the Forebears been doing? Forming useless alliances?"
"115740052-0-8707";"No. They've been focusing on the reality around us. You'd be wise to listen more closely to them."
"115740052-0-8708";"I'm sorry to hear about your wife's passing. Have you had her consecrated yet?"
"115740052-0-8709";"Thank you, friend. We have kept her body in our home a few more days."
"115740052-0-8710";"Because of the Withered Hand?"
"115740052-0-8711";"Yes, indirectly. Their influence here has caused ritual prices to rise. I could not afford it."
"115740052-0-8712";"By the gods, that is horrific. Is nothing sacred now?"
"115740052-0-8713";"Indeed. I didn't think you could put a price on sanctity."
"115740052-0-8714";"If I were to give those necromancers credit, I'd say that this was part of their plan."
"115740052-0-8715";"Are you assuming there are Withered Hand among the temple priests?"
"115740052-0-8716";"Be quiet. You never know whose ears are listening."
"115740052-0-8717";"What's the matter? You look shaken today."
"115740052-0-8718";"I think I saw your mother walking around the desert outside the city yesterday."
"115740052-0-8719";"That's impossible. My mother's been dead for three years."
"115740052-0-8720";"I know."
"115740052-0-8721";"What did you do? Did she say anything?"
"115740052-0-8722";"I don't know. I ran. The dead are sacred, and I'm not one to dishonor them by disturbing their slumber."
"115740052-0-8723";"So you ran away? That's not exactly honorable as well."
"115740052-0-8724";"I'd rather be a coward than a blasphemer. Maybe she'll show up at your door today. If she does, you try talking to a corpse."
"115740052-0-8725";"Our king is a shrewd man."
"115740052-0-8726";"How do you mean?"
"115740052-0-8727";"Haven't you heard? Somebody cleared the Rain Catchers. Our water is clean again."
"115740052-0-8728";"And how does this make the King shrewd?"
"115740052-0-8729";"Because he had someone clear the Rain Catchers silently and without drawing attention to it."
"115740052-0-8730";"And before the people started to grumble. I see what you mean."
"115740052-0-8731";"Exactly. I imagine this hero as a tall, honorable Redguard with shining armor and a brilliantly curved sword. What do you think?"
"115740052-0-8732";"I don't know. I'm beginning to trust fewer and fewer of our people as it is. Especially with those necromancers running loose in the desert."
"115740052-0-8733";"I may have been harsh before about our Covenant brethren."
"115740052-0-8737";"Those warriors are doing what our men cannot. They're fighting our honored dead."
"115740052-0-8739";"And I have a good mind to commend them for bravery. They're defying the gods in order to save our land."
"115740052-0-8741";"Are you still troubled, my friend?"
"115740052-0-8742";"Of course I am. As long as there are men on earth, there will be signs of strife."
"115740052-0-8743";"That's not quite a Crown way of thinking. What changed your mind?"
"115740052-0-8744";"No, it isn't. There've been some hopeful events as of late."
"115740052-0-8745";"Such as what?"
"115740052-0-8746";"Onsi has sent us brave warriors to fight against evil."
"115740052-0-8747";"Yes. These strangers do ease the tensions some."
"115740052-0-8748";"The Forebears look to these brave souls as guardians for a new age. I can't share their optimism, though. To me, they're more signs of trouble ahead."
"115740052-0-8749";"Don't be so pessimistic. There's still hope."
"115740052-0-8750";"If hope can only come through eternal struggle, then may Onsi put his sword to rest forever."
"115740052-0-8751";"I will never understand magic. It's too illogical. I cannot understand why Julianos allows it in this world."
"115740052-0-8752";"Death is permanent, despite how some men manipulate it. Why would death magic be any different?"
"115740052-0-8753";"I hope Saturah's children abide by those same rules."
"115740052-0-8754";"We'll never know unless the Withered Hand are wiped out completely."
"115740052-0-8755";"You're right! The only way to truly kill a necromancer is to kill all necromancers."
"115740052-0-8756";"The Ansei Wards have been restored, but I don't understand why I still see the dead walking around."
"115740052-0-8757";"Or hope that he has no friends willing to revive him."
"115740052-0-8758";"Save the villagers! Find our people!"
"115740052-0-8759";"The Withered Hand were powerful magicians. You can't expect their power to wane automatically."
"115740052-0-8761";"blows the whistle."
"115740052-0-8763";"Rhavil?"
"115740052-0-8764";"You don't give up, do you?"
"115740052-0-8765";"You're back. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-8767";"Your interference grows tiresome, outsider!"
"115740052-0-8768";"After I destroy you, nothing will stand in Vox's way."
"115740052-0-8769";"I'm free? Thank you."
"115740052-0-8770";"For a moment there, I thought my natural charisma might have failed me."
"115740052-0-8771";"Why must I follow?"
"115740052-0-8773";"There you are. Good to see you made it."
"115740052-0-8783";"I'll chop your head clean off."
"115740052-0-8784";"This won't take long."
"115740052-0-8785";"Come at me!"
"115740052-0-8786";"Don't be timid."
"115740052-0-8787";"This should be fun."
"115740052-0-8788";"Try to put up a decent fight."
"115740052-0-8795";"Legions of Akaviri invaded our shores."
"115740052-0-8796";"They came, killing and burning, though we never knew why."
"115740052-0-8797";"I died as the flood came. It swept them all away."
"115740052-0-8798";"The waters took friend and foe alike."
"115740052-0-8799";"The tides rolled in, crushing all in their path."
"115740052-0-8800";"The Akaviri were defeated, but at what cost?"
"115740052-0-8801";"Die, Akaviri! Die!"
"115740052-0-8802";"I'll watch your back while you crush spider eggs."
"115740052-0-8803";"Destroy the spider eggs. Rouse the spider queen. Death to the Goblins!"
"115740052-0-8804";"Don't be foolish, Captain. Boredom is the only danger these soldiers face."
"115740052-0-8805";"Weapons out. Here they come."
"115740052-0-8806";"For Bjorick! For Hrogar! For Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-8807";"Kyne speed you to Sovngarde, beast."
"115740052-0-8808";"We've won the day! I'll meet you at the hall."
"115740052-0-8809";"General, we must enforce protocol. If—"
"115740052-0-8810";"Enough! Not another word about protocol, Captain. Remember your place!"
"115740052-0-8811";"You there! Hold a moment!"
"115740052-0-8813";"Is this the place? Quarantine Serk?"
"115740052-0-8814";"We're almost there. Soon, the Maulborn will give us the cure!"
"115740052-0-8815";"If they get to me in time."
"115740052-0-8816";"Of course they will. You'll be fine."
"115740052-0-8817";"If it doesn't work, you should know I've always …."
"115740052-0-8818";"Don't say it. There's a cure. There has to be."
"115740052-0-8824";"Their leader comes! Take him down."
"115740052-0-8825";"Who's fallen? And where are my sons? Find them!"
"115740052-0-8826";"You should be able to hear me now."
"115740052-0-8827";"Are you following me?"
"115740052-0-8828";"Not so close. He's getting suspicious."
"115740052-0-8829";"There he is. Let's follow him."
"115740052-0-8830";"He went into that shack. Wait for him to leave."
"115740052-0-8836";"He's out. That was fast."
"115740052-0-8837";"Try to get inside that shack."
"115740052-0-8840";"Oh for … what now, Rhavil?"
"115740052-0-8841";"So you're the meddler who undid all of Rhavil's work."
"115740052-0-8842";"Such a waste of my time."
"115740052-0-8843";"The dead depend on you. You must consecrate them."
"115740052-0-8844";"A communication spell? Let's see who Rhavil called."
"115740052-0-8846";"That woman wore a Covenant uniform."
"115740052-0-8847";"Rhavil must be working for the enemy."
"115740052-0-8848";"Go to his house and see what you can find. I'll send my guards."
"115740052-0-8849";"You won't take me! Conele gave me potions."
"115740052-0-8850";"Ha ha ha! Ow! I quit."
"115740052-0-8851";"Got the coin? The boss don't buy promises."
"115740052-0-8852";"It arrived on our ship. You'll all be very rich very soon."
"115740052-0-8853";"Then we've got your supplies: weapons, food and drink, medicine … and protection."
"115740052-0-8854";"Well, you're tougher than you look."
"115740052-0-8855";"Oof! I yield, friend. Good fight!"
"115740052-0-8856";"All right, you got me. Say, you're not bad!"
"115740052-0-8857";"Quick! The coral weakens."
"115740052-0-8858";"Ha ha ha! Stop! I need more mead."
"115740052-0-8859";"Whoa, sabre cat! Let's go back to drinking."
"115740052-0-8860";"I feel it! The coral speaks to me."
"115740052-0-8861";"I'll meet you in its heart."
"115740052-0-8862";"My friend! Can you hear me?"
"115740052-0-8863";"The coral is dying. The Breton stole its heart!"
"115740052-0-8864";"The dreugh serve us now, but it's not enough. Find me at the heart."
"115740052-0-8865";"Take our heart. Keep it safe. The coral and I can now live without it."
"115740052-0-8867";"Quickly, friend! Over here."
"115740052-0-8871";"It's about time someone paid that Khajiit a visit."
"115740052-0-8872";"You there! Please, I have an urgent message."
"115740052-0-8873";"Eyes open, now."
"115740052-0-8875";"I'll be here if you change your mind."
"115740052-0-8876";"Is someone there? Help me! Please!"
"115740052-0-8877";"Enough, I yield. You fight like wamasu!"
"115740052-0-8882";"Excellent work! Meet <<1>> and me when you're finished."
"115740052-0-8883";"<Beast scream>"
"115740052-0-8887";"You have disobeyed my orders for the last time!"
"115740052-0-8888";"Enough! I will drag you back to Oblivion with me!"
"115740052-0-8889";"You bear a gift? How thoughtful! But I can't accept it without providing one of my own."
"115740052-0-8890";"I know! I'll share the same gift I gave <<1>>. Now you can play skeever-wicket with your own skull! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-8898";"Hey! Over here! Help me!"
"115740052-0-8899";"The Hist is in my mind. So strange! I must … I must …."
"115740052-0-8907";"What? What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-8908";"I've returned. My thanks."
"115740052-0-8909";"No one goes into the Gorge. Got that?"
"115740052-0-8910";"Do we say why the pass is closed?"
"115740052-0-8911";"Tell them there's death in the pass. Leave it at that."
"115740052-0-8912";"Yes, Commander!"
"115740052-0-8913";"It worked! Oh, and it's so beautiful. I must tell the others!"
"115740052-0-8918";"High Rock and Hammerfell!"
"115740052-0-8920";"I give myself to the power of death!"
"115740052-0-8936";"Glory for the Pact!"
"115740052-0-8937";"Tanval, no! The Coral Heart is too powerful."
"115740052-0-8938";"Tanval, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-8939";"Psst! Thanks again, friend!"
"115740052-0-8940";"Hey! You nix-hound!"
"115740052-0-8941";"The flag has been stripped due to stealthing!"
"115740052-0-8944";"You're the one who saved us. Tall Papa bless you!"
"115740052-0-8945";"You there! Thank you for saving our city!"
"115740052-0-8946";"Hallin's Stand will eventually return to normal."
"115740052-0-8947";"You saved the grandeya from the Imperials, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-8951";"Who disturbs my rest?"
"115740052-0-8952";"Get away from that!"
"115740052-0-8953";"Ah, Stormcrag. Good timing. Come here!"
"115740052-0-8954";"Sorry, Captain. Didn't mean to eavesdrop."
"115740052-0-8955";"News of the General's death will spread quickly. We must maintain order."
"115740052-0-8956";"More Dark Elf discipline and protocol? That's what caused this mess."
"115740052-0-8957";"That's why I want to appoint you as my aide and advisor, so our discipline doesn't blind us again."
"115740052-0-8958";"Me? Yes, I'd be happy to help keep the fortress on track."
"115740052-0-8959";"Oh, no—they're still fighting out here."
"115740052-0-8960";"You push the limits of my hospitality, Captain."
"115740052-0-8961";"Surely we can compromise on the matter."
"115740052-0-8962";"Remember, Grandmaster, the urgency of our business."
"115740052-0-8963";"As you say, Captain. As you say."
"115740052-0-8964";"You're stronger than these Maulborn idiots!"
"115740052-0-8965";"Morrowind shall be laid waste! Vox will break this land!"
"115740052-0-8966";"Thank you for saving me! I knew Dolril would send help."
"115740052-0-8967";"Thank the Tribunal! It was getting so hot in here!"
"115740052-0-8968";"Praise Vivec! Did Dolril send you?"
"115740052-0-8969";"I understand you've had your differences with the grandmaster, but I'd hope your loyalty would lie with House Dres."
"115740052-0-8970";"It gives me great pleasure to watch him squirm. When I grow weary of that, then I may consider assisting him."
"115740052-0-8971";"I wish you'd reconsider. The future of House Dres is at stake!"
"115740052-0-8973";"Archers! To your positions!"
"115740052-0-8974";"Once the arrows start flying, they'll be on us in no time."
"115740052-0-8975";"We did it! All right, back to the cave."
"115740052-0-8976";"Mind you don't go running off with this."
"115740052-0-8979";"Psst! Someone's here. Get scarce."
"115740052-0-8980";"Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-8981";"Glad we understand each other."
"115740052-0-8982";"Mercy! I yield!"
"115740052-0-8985";"You don't look so tough."
"115740052-0-8987";"You can't imagine the horrors in that thing!"
"115740052-0-8988";"Ho, outlander!"
"115740052-0-8990";"Here all along, was it? By Sithis, it was right under my feet!"
"115740052-0-8991";"Look what you've done! I've lost count!"
"115740052-0-8992";"I'll feed your heart to my cat!"
"115740052-0-8993";"Useless cat!"
"115740052-0-8994";"Once I dispatch you, Hissmir will be ours!"
"115740052-0-8995";"Wait a breath!"
"115740052-0-8996";"You'd kill our people to save them? What madness is that?"
"115740052-0-8997";"My warriors won't allow you to perpetrate this foolishness."
"115740052-0-8998";"You should've stayed out of this!"
"115740052-0-8999";"You can't be so cruel. This is eternal torment!"
"115740052-0-9000";"My acolytes won't allow you to curse us with life!"
"115740052-0-9003";"Hey! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-9004";"What the—?"
"115740052-0-9007";"I'll take those!"
"115740052-0-9008";"You there! I will cloak you in shadow. Enter the portal and witness our victory."
"115740052-0-9009";"You've felt the true splendor of my gift to <<1>>. What gift have you for them, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-9010";"I will follow them to make sure they remain safe."
"115740052-0-9011";"Preserve their existence or end it forever. Which will it be? Probably the boring one."
"115740052-0-9012";"Please, find any other survivors, then come see me!"
"115740052-0-9013";"What a beautiful sight it is! One-Eye can't wait to get her talons on it."
"115740052-0-9014";"S'jash will take care of this. You have business to attend to with One-Eye."
"115740052-0-9015";"Heartless oaf! You'd destroy everyone in <<1>>, despite the ones who clearly wish to go on? All to end a pain and sickness they can no longer feel? How delicious."
"115740052-0-9016";"Callous brute! You would remove their capacity to truly die, forcing them to suffer their endless existence until the end of time? Are you too weak to allow them the rest deserved by all mortal creatures? How intoxicating."
"115740052-0-9017";"I must inform the vicecanon of this situation!"
"115740052-0-9018";"Now begone."
"115740052-0-9019";"That accursed rock contains more horrors than Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-9020";"Inside that thing is … nothing! You cannot imagine!"
"115740052-0-9021";"Death will release me from the nothingness inside that thing."
"115740052-0-9022";"It seems we have an unexpected guest!"
"115740052-0-9023";"Here's your hero, Elf."
"115740052-0-9027";"Someone, please help me!"
"115740052-0-9028";"The other one, the Elf? He ran right past me. Well, a good deed is its own reward."
"115740052-0-9029";"Open the windows! Out of my way! Don't let them bite you!"
"115740052-0-9042";"The Kothringi are upon us! Quickly, activate the Zaht stones."
"115740052-0-9043";"Such power! Were it ever to fall into the Kothringi's hands …."
"115740052-0-9046";"Neposh knew the terms when he summoned me!"
"115740052-0-9047";"You say for this next trial I'll need to run? Fine."
"115740052-0-9051";"Ha! I knew you'd be no trouble!"
"115740052-0-9052";"The Zaht stone must not be activated!"
"115740052-0-9053";"You are intriguing. Won't you come with me?"
"115740052-0-9054";"What? Who? Where is my eggspawn?"
"115740052-0-9069";"Why are you searching my belongings?"
"115740052-0-9070";"Get away from me, brigand!"
"115740052-0-9071";"You've upset her! Leave, so I may calm my wife."
"115740052-0-9072";"Neposh, is your brainshell cracked? Bargains with Daedra? I am ashamed."
"115740052-0-9073";"What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-9074";"Don't let him reach the lava."
"115740052-0-9075";"Balreth is bound forever. Let's return to Ash Mountain."
"115740052-0-9076";"Ah! Khasaad has found you."
"115740052-0-9077";"The new Hand has arrived. Notify Almalexia that her champion is here."
"115740052-0-9078";"Well met, Hand of Almalexia."
"115740052-0-9079";"You received Veloth's blessing and have come to the Hollow, just as I have foreseen."
"115740052-0-9080";"The blasphemer Vox has sealed herself behind powerful wards. While these wards are in place, she is hidden from me."
"115740052-0-9081";"Three wards protect her—one bound to the living, one to the dead, and one to the Daedric planes."
"115740052-0-9082";"Destroy these wards. Then you will be able to enter the blasphemer's lair."
"115740052-0-9085";"Divines bless you!"
"115740052-0-9086";"Wait! This is one of the places on the map."
"115740052-0-9088";"Don't leave us! We can't do this without you!"
"115740052-0-9089";"Quiet, fool! I paid you for your discretion… remember?"
"115740052-0-9090";"It was just idle talk, friend. I assure you, I had nothing to do with it."
"115740052-0-9091";"Hey, Rhavil! No offal today. The temple's forbidden all sales."
"115740052-0-9092";"Look here, it's that fancy sod was in our camp. Hey, fancy man! Fallen on any swords lately? Hah!"
"115740052-0-9093";"Saying we shouldn't help the Dunmer. Hah! Like a Nord would ever turn down a fight."
"115740052-0-9094";"The drunk one took your advice, silver tongue! He now regrets it. For shame."
"115740052-0-9095";"Enough! I surrender!"
"115740052-0-9096";"Victory is yours! I submit!"
"115740052-0-9097";"I'm going to enjoy stomping you into the dirt."
"115740052-0-9098";"Finally! A real challenge!"
"115740052-0-9099";"Aanthis!"
"115740052-0-9100";"Hold. What do you have there?"
"115740052-0-9101";"Where are you going?"
"115740052-0-9102";"Let this one through."
"115740052-0-9103";"It is done. Meet me back at my lodge."
"115740052-0-9104";"Heed my call … Balreth, I summon you!"
"115740052-0-9105";"More coming! Keep them away from father."
"115740052-0-9106";"Why do you wait here among the common people?"
"115740052-0-9107";"Such trivia can wait. I would speak with you."
"115740052-0-9108";"Meet me in the Temple, for events of epic proportions are unfolding."
"115740052-0-9109";"I'll take these weapons to town and get help."
"115740052-0-9110";"Claws out! We're ambushed!"
"115740052-0-9111";"This is good. Now we need to find the second landmark."
"115740052-0-9112";"Here! This is on the map, as well."
"115740052-0-9113";"There, see how the symbols point? On to the treasure!"
"115740052-0-9114";"Jone and Jode, it really is here!"
"115740052-0-9115";"Look out!"
"115740052-0-9118";"This way is not on the map. We must go back."
"115740052-0-9144";"Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-9145";"The older ruins are suprisingly complex. Lizards never built these."
"115740052-0-9146";"We've found no evidence of a prior civilization."
"115740052-0-9147";"At least the lizards are resilient. They'll serve us nicely."
"115740052-0-9150";"What do you think of my new slaves?"
"115740052-0-9152";"Their skin will give your flesh sculptures great color and texture."
"115740052-0-9153";"Indeed! My masterpiece will rival the Wailing Wheels of Vindasel!"
"115740052-0-9154";"Your revolt will fail, slave. You are mere animals!"
"115740052-0-9155";"Alessia has shown us the way, Elf. We are slaves no longer!"
"115740052-0-9163";"Hey, where are you going?"
"115740052-0-9164";"I really need to speak to you."
"115740052-0-9165";"What's going on out here?"
"115740052-0-9166";"Serpentine!  Serpentine!"
"115740052-0-9167";"Door is locked."
"115740052-0-9168";"Well done, my son."
"115740052-0-9181";"Somebody help me!"
"115740052-0-9182";"Look at what we have here. Give us everything you got, shop keeper."
"115740052-0-9183";"Thank you! Here, it's not much, but I appreciate your help."
"115740052-0-9185";"They say you killed Angof. I thought you'd be taller."
"115740052-0-9186";"I know you! You're the savior of Glenumbra!"
"115740052-0-9187";"In honor of your victory at Cath Bedraud, I owe you a keg."
"115740052-0-9188";"My clan's from Glenumbra. Thanks for slaying that Angof!"
"115740052-0-9189";"You're the one who exposed the Dark Council!"
"115740052-0-9190";"Has the bloodfiend menace truly been stopped?"
"115740052-0-9191";"Are the vampires of Rivenspire truly gone?"
"115740052-0-9192";"Well met, vampire slayer of the Doomcrag!"
"115740052-0-9193";"The Viridian Woods thrive, thanks to you!"
"115740052-0-9194";"Thank you for saving Princess Elara!"
"115740052-0-9195";"May the Viridian Sentinel guide you."
"115740052-0-9196";"Hail the hero of the Viridian Woods!"
"115740052-0-9197";"I can't believe you defeated King Eamond!"
"115740052-0-9198";"All hail the scourge of the undead!"
"115740052-0-9199";"Good day, Champion of the Necropolis."
"115740052-0-9200";"General Tharn was no match for you!"
"115740052-0-9201";"The Grandeya of Hallin's Stand praises your bravery."
"115740052-0-9202";"Captain Dhakir sends his regards, friend."
"115740052-0-9203";"Blade's edge, it's the victor of Hallin's Stand!"
"115740052-0-9204";"Namurrah's champion! Hallin's Stand toasts your victory!"
"115740052-0-9205";"Onsi bless the slayer of Suturah's spawn."
"115740052-0-9206";"You proved the bravery of the Ash'abah!"
"115740052-0-9207";"By your might, the Withered Hand is broken in Alik'r!"
"115740052-0-9208";"Thanks to you, the dead of Motalion have returned to their rest."
"115740052-0-9209";"Thank you for saving King Emeric."
"115740052-0-9210";"You stopped old Vaermina, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-9211";"I hear King Emeric thanked you personally!"
"115740052-0-9212";"Wayrest has a lot to thank you for."
"115740052-0-9213";"If you're here, those Imperials won't attack again!"
"115740052-0-9214";"You saved the garrison from certain disaster!"
"115740052-0-9215";"Arkay bless you for saving the garrison."
"115740052-0-9216";"Your courage at the garrison is the talk of Evermore!"
"115740052-0-9217";"Who would have thought Sir Renchant was a traitor?"
"115740052-0-9218";"If not for you, we'd be paying taxes to Cyrodiil now."
"115740052-0-9219";"Thanks to you, Gharzu's extortion is finished!"
"115740052-0-9220";"You're the one the queen spoke of. Divines bless you!"
"115740052-0-9224";"The prince meant well, but you were right to stop him."
"115740052-0-9226";"I saw Queen Therese leading ghostly troops south."
"115740052-0-9227";"I've seen what Adrien has become. What a sacrifice!"
"115740052-0-9228";"I saw Prince Adrien leading skeletal troops south."
"115740052-0-9234";"Queen Arzhela must get back on her feet. Evermore needs her!"
"115740052-0-9239";"Quiet! You want the guards to hear?"
"115740052-0-9240";"The knight regent's lackeys? Let them listen."
"115740052-0-9241";"You're going to get us locked in the stocks … or worse!"
"115740052-0-9258";"Well met, sentry. Anything to report?"
"115740052-0-9260";"I know. Why do we trust this Orc and his gang?"
"115740052-0-9263";"Another of the usual."
"115740052-0-9273";"Not yet. It might be a while."
"115740052-0-9275";"Time to raise prices!"
"115740052-0-9276";"Sir Renchant isn't fit to polish the throne, let alone sit on it."
"115740052-0-9277";"Er, yes, we are having nice weather."
"115740052-0-9278";"What? Didn't you hear what I said?"
"115740052-0-9279";"What shall we have for dinner tonight?"
"115740052-0-9281";"Aye. The citizens are smiling at us again."
"115740052-0-9283";"Anything for Evermore!"
"115740052-0-9284";"Enchanted swords! Runes and staves! All at Todrak's!"
"115740052-0-9285";"Come to Todrak's for all your arcane needs!"
"115740052-0-9286";"Why carry a common sword? Buy from Todrak!"
"115740052-0-9287";"Heard from your brother in Hallin's Stand?"
"115740052-0-9288";"Zeht's tears, no. No word yet."
"115740052-0-9289";"Stay strong. The priest says Tu'whacca won't test us forever."
"115740052-0-9290";"He would say that. He has a jackal's smile."
"115740052-0-9291";"is about to leave the event area!"
"115740052-0-9294";"You really shouldn't be walking around alone around here. Tell you what, you give us everything you got, and we won't kill you."
"115740052-0-9295";"Thank you so much! I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-9309";"Big dumb fleshbag! Zix is king here! You die now!"
"115740052-0-9310";"Away with you, mortal! This soul belongs to Zix!"
"115740052-0-9313";"Over here! Help!"
"115740052-0-9314";"Aaaiiiiggghhhhh!"
"115740052-0-9318";"It's not like you're safer here, minstrel. Goblins go wherever there's prey. I'd keep an eye out, if I were you."
"115740052-0-9319";"Are you insane? I'm not going anywhere until they clear those ruins."
"115740052-0-9320";"Are you still here? Aren't you performing at a banquet in Wayrest tomorrow?"
"115740052-0-9321";"The roads aren't safe. Goblins are in the ruins nearby. No amount of silver is worth losing my head to the Bonesnap tribe."
"115740052-0-9322";"So with the Bonesnap Goblins handled, will you head to Wayrest?"
"115740052-0-9323";"Eager to get rid of me? I thought I could stay here, play some inspiring songs …."
"115740052-0-9324";"Don't even think about it, minstrel. I'll shoot you full of arrows if you so much as whistle."
"115740052-0-9325";"Ouch. And here I thought the Goblins were cruel! Blessed Mara, heal my wounded heart."
"115740052-0-9326";"There's no way I'm going back there!"
"115740052-0-9327";"We'll meet you in the secured area. For the Pact!"
"115740052-0-9331";"The ward has been dispelled. Go find Serien. We'll join you as soon as we've recovered our strength."
"115740052-0-9332";"Drillk! Remember your duty!"
"115740052-0-9333";"My mind … my memories! I remember now! I think I might be sick …."
"115740052-0-9334";"Who calls me? Stand and fight!"
"115740052-0-9335";"Who dares take my ashes?"
"115740052-0-9336";"Hold! I will help defend the walls."
"115740052-0-9337";"I am beaten. You have my aid."
"115740052-0-9338";"On your guard. We don't know what's up ahead."
"115740052-0-9342";"What is the meaning of this intrusion?"
"115740052-0-9350";"The tear is kept below in the basement. Let's go get it!"
"115740052-0-9351";"Stop! This one belongs to Zix!"
"115740052-0-9352";"Zix will have you, too!"
"115740052-0-9353";"Get behind this stump before you're seen!"
"115740052-0-9354";"Thank the Tribunal I found you!"
"115740052-0-9355";"Look everywhere. Any clues we find may lead us to the cure."
"115740052-0-9356";"Something must be done about the Vanguard. Now."
"115740052-0-9357";"The grandmaster's son is in peril. He must be saved."
"115740052-0-9358";"Let nothing stand in your way. Save the scion of House Dres!"
"115740052-0-9359";"Seen any loose guar, stranger?"
"115740052-0-9360";"Remember, they like to be scratched under the chin."
"115740052-0-9361";"We wish you luck, traveler."
"115740052-0-9362";"The hopes of Stonefalls go with you!"
"115740052-0-9363";"It's a mistake to provoke House Dres."
"115740052-0-9364";"You will be my hand of vengeance!"
"115740052-0-9365";"Sun on your scales, friend."
"115740052-0-9366";"Keep your tail straight and your belly wet."
"115740052-0-9367";"Die, Volek, for Eyes-that-Glint!"
"115740052-0-9368";"What'd you find? What is that?"
"115740052-0-9369";"That's the recipe for the Llodos Plague. We've done it!"
"115740052-0-9370";"Rrraaarrrgghh!!!! testing!!!?"
"115740052-0-9371";"I'm leaving before something bad happens to me, too!"
"115740052-0-9372";"Please! There's another way!"
"115740052-0-9373";"Wait … what's happening?"
"115740052-0-9374";"You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?"
"115740052-0-9375";"You resist my plague? Let's try a stronger version!"
"115740052-0-9376";"No, not that! Arrhhh!"
"115740052-0-9377";"I shall experiment upon your body."
"115740052-0-9378";"I told you, Varon. Our champion survives!"
"115740052-0-9381";"Honor to you and your noble house."
"115740052-0-9382";"Learn from the past. Peer through the window."
"115740052-0-9385";"Honor to you and your noble house."
"115740052-0-9386";"View the past. Open the window."
"115740052-0-9387";"Dark magic is loose in Heimlyn Keep."
"115740052-0-9394";"We've got to put an end to this."
"115740052-0-9395";"The Keeper will know what to do."
"115740052-0-9396";"Meet me on the north road when you finish."
"115740052-0-9397";"You have wandered far. Rest now … with me."
"115740052-0-9398";"Why do you resist? I offer you peace."
"115740052-0-9399";"Begone, spirit!"
"115740052-0-9400";"Be strong, stranger!"
"115740052-0-9401";"Come. You've seen the danger firsthand."
"115740052-0-9402";"Oh, thank you. If you succeed, bring the medallions to me, north of Muth Gnaar."
"115740052-0-9403";"Over here! I could use a little help, please!"
"115740052-0-9404";"Spirits of the bog! Creatures of nature!"
"115740052-0-9405";"Show me your wounds! Reveal your injury!"
"115740052-0-9407";"It's done. Meet us outside and we'll conclude this foul business."
"115740052-0-9408";"Farona Telvanni! Stand and face me."
"115740052-0-9409";"They come!"
"115740052-0-9410";"Sacred Lady! Please! I didn't realize …."
"115740052-0-9411";"I shall forgive you, provided you aid my agent who stands before you."
"115740052-0-9412";"Yes, Sacred Mother. Your will is my own."
"115740052-0-9413";"As for you, my champion, you have done well. I grant you the authority to deal with the murderer who flouts my power."
"115740052-0-9414";"The Dominion attack. Such madness!"
"115740052-0-9415";"These Aldmeri will learn we aren't such easy prey."
"115740052-0-9416";"Watch out for the Dominion! They attack from the shadows."
"115740052-0-9425";"The courtyard is ours!"
"115740052-0-9426";"The vessel calls to souls long lost!"
"115740052-0-9427";"No! I must not fail!"
"115740052-0-9428";"Not Garyn! Not Garyn!"
"115740052-0-9429";"Ah, the meddler. Still working for that so-called goddess?"
"115740052-0-9432";"So impressed by Almalexia's stolen grandeur that you've fallen for her lies?"
"115740052-0-9433";"I killed Magister Navisdyn to show the weakness of your imposter god."
"115740052-0-9434";"And while she runs around trying to find a murderer, we—but you'll see soon enough. When the Temple falls, and the city will follow."
"115740052-0-9436";"What's happening?"
"115740052-0-9437";"Now that that's done, I'll clean up in here and then meet you outside."
"115740052-0-9438";"You've won nothing, dog!"
"115740052-0-9439";"Fool!"
"115740052-0-9440";"To me, warriors!"
"115740052-0-9441";"The map guides us, my friend. Lead on!"
"115740052-0-9442";"Sun warm your scales, landstrider."
"115740052-0-9443";"I need your help."
"115740052-0-9450";"The Daggerfall Covenant took my son!"
"115740052-0-9451";"No, Holgunn. The Covenant must pay!"
"115740052-0-9452";"I can help you treat the injured."
"115740052-0-9453";"You'd poison them. Ashlanders are all the same."
"115740052-0-9454";"Curate! Curate!"
"115740052-0-9455";"Ashlanders have tunneled under the walls!"
"115740052-0-9462";"Heed me, Kagesh warriors!"
"115740052-0-9463";"I bid you let this one pass unharmed."
"115740052-0-9464";"Follow us! Our castle is nearby."
"115740052-0-9465";"Trolls take you, registrar! Bah! We go home now."
"115740052-0-9466";"Abandon this foolishness, and you may yet live!"
"115740052-0-9468";"Damned scorpions! They killed my goat!"
"115740052-0-9471";"Why bother, stupid mortal? Give up."
"115740052-0-9472";"What are these bog-pickers to you? Abandon this folly!"
"115740052-0-9473";"Envoy Rigurt, I regret to inform you that you'll need to wait a few more days."
"115740052-0-9475";"No! Wait, you can't leave. It's highly irregular—think of the paperwork!"
"115740052-0-9476";"You mustn't do this, my son. Defying the Tribunal is a death sentence."
"115740052-0-9477";"Enough, Mother! Your faith in false gods blinds you to the truth."
"115740052-0-9478";"You mustn't say such things, Meram."
"115740052-0-9479";"Silence, Mother! The Daedric Princes return. I welcome them as the true gods of this land."
"115740052-0-9480";"Please, Meram! Come back. I don't want to see you get hurt."
"115740052-0-9481";"All right, lads—time to don our fancy new Elf clothes!"
"115740052-0-9482";"My child, why have you spilled innocent blood? What has led you to perform such evil?"
"115740052-0-9483";"You are a lie, Almalexia! A false god! I renounce you as the imposter you are!"
"115740052-0-9484";"You show no remorse and your crimes cannot be ignored. Let this be a lesson to all who would oppose the Tribunal."
"115740052-0-9485";"I warned you! Meet your doom!"
"115740052-0-9487";"It is done!"
"115740052-0-9488";"No, my lady! Mercy! I beg of you! He's my only son!"
"115740052-0-9489";"What mercy did Meram show his victims? I am sorry, dear Urili, but he has earned this punishment."
"115740052-0-9490";"Ahhhh!"
"115740052-0-9491";"Thanks, friend. I'll make my way out of here once I catch my breath."
"115740052-0-9492";"I thought I was going to die down here. I can find my own way out."
"115740052-0-9493";"That was terrible! The world almost lost beautiful Natan!"
"115740052-0-9494";"Blech! I hate the taste of sand!"
"115740052-0-9497";"Your corpssse shall feed the hatchlingsss!"
"115740052-0-9498";"There are too many. We must try again."
"115740052-0-9499";"Beware, unscaled one. Ssethreka is near. She will try to stop you."
"115740052-0-9502";"I can't go much farther. Are we there yet?"
"115740052-0-9507";"I can't go on. I have to go back. Meet me at the entrance to town when you're ready to take me to the inn."
"115740052-0-9508";"Those mercenaries were armed. Do you think they were bandits?"
"115740052-0-9509";"I don't know. Hram and Heyazzin are still up there, aren't they?"
"115740052-0-9510";"A goat herder and a crazy old man don't stand a chance against bandits!"
"115740052-0-9511";"They didn't stop to harass us for coin, so they're probably just mercenaries."
"115740052-0-9512";"False gods. False justice. Meram was right. The Daedric Princes must return. And blood must flow!"
"115740052-0-9516";"Please don't hit me!"
"115740052-0-9517";"If they see us talking, I'll be punished!"
"115740052-0-9518";"Please leave me alone."
"115740052-0-9519";"I hope I get a full portion of gruel tonight."
"115740052-0-9520";"So… thirsty…"
"115740052-0-9521";"Let them die. Let them rot. Let them feel my pain. No false gods can stop me!"
"115740052-0-9522";"If they see us talking, I'll be punished!"
"115740052-0-9523";"You get used to the whippings after a while."
"115740052-0-9524";"Will this day never end?"
"115740052-0-9525";"Yes, Urili, yes. Let your plague spread across the land as your rage fills you and makes you strong. But you need Veloth's hammer. You must take it for your own."
"115740052-0-9526";"The Judgment? That's what my son sought to possess. Yes! It will be mine! And with Judgment in my hand, the Tribunal shall fall!"
"115740052-0-9527";"Go. Gather your followers. Spread your plague. Wield the hammer. With it, you can devour living souls and unleash your true power!"
"115740052-0-9528";"Heh heh. You think to hide from me, intruder?"
"115740052-0-9529";"I. See. You. Heh. Heh heh."
"115740052-0-9533";"You've ruined our life together!"
"115740052-0-9536";"Elynisi? Thank the Three you made it! We feared the worst. Have you brought help?"
"115740052-0-9537";"It was a close call. I'd be dead if not for this traveler's assistance."
"115740052-0-9538";"You've chosen a bad time to visit Selfora, stranger. Spirits roam the streets and unquenchable fire consumes the town. Selfora is lost."
"115740052-0-9539";"Don't be too hasty, Meldras. Our new friend is powerful. I've seen what the traveler can do."
"115740052-0-9540";"You! The meddler from my memories. Have you come to die?"
"115740052-0-9541";"I will have your power! And the Tribunal's as well!"
"115740052-0-9542";"Another one. But there's something different about this one."
"115740052-0-9543";"You're right, Meram. This one's … solid."
"115740052-0-9557";"<<1>>, let our visitor speak. We can't continue without help."
"115740052-0-9558";"What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-9559";"Radithax, if you will."
"115740052-0-9560";"Of course. May Sithis watch over you, my friend."
"115740052-0-9561";"Ah, this one has a body that I can rend."
"115740052-0-9574";"Our allies have broken through! Press the attack!"
"115740052-0-9575";"The Vanguard is breaking! We're forcing them back!"
"115740052-0-9576";"They've surrendered. The Vanguard has surrendered!"
"115740052-0-9577";"This tail-suckler has no worth to the Night Mother."
"115740052-0-9585";"Meddling fool! Your interference ends here!"
"115740052-0-9586";"You think removing me is that easy? Face my protectors!"
"115740052-0-9587";"Bah! Those were just fodder. There are more to come!"
"115740052-0-9588";"Gather round! Watch as I teach this upstart a lesson."
"115740052-0-9589";"Come, now. Show us your prowess."
"115740052-0-9590";"What is this? Petty magics for a petty people …"
"115740052-0-9592";"Through your wisdom and judgment, you have earned Vivec's favor. Receive our blessing."
"115740052-0-9593";"Selfora is dead! You will not save her!"
"115740052-0-9594";"No! It cannot be!"
"115740052-0-9595";"Behold! I bear the Hammer of Veloth, priest. I have come to rally my people against the taint of the Three."
"115740052-0-9596";"Praise to the Three, Magistrix Vox. To what do we owe the honor of your visit?"
"115740052-0-9597";"What are you saying, Vox? Have you gone mad?"
"115740052-0-9598";"Mad? You want to see mad? Let me show you true madness …."
"115740052-0-9603";"It worked! Oh no … I don't have control!"
"115740052-0-9606";"So this is the Reservoir of Souls? How strange!"
"115740052-0-9607";"It's so good to have my body back again."
"115740052-0-9613";"I am yours, beloved."
"115740052-0-9614";"My love! Protect me!"
"115740052-0-9615";"What is this place? Gods, what is that?"
"115740052-0-9616";"Captain, get out of Kragenmoor. You may leave with your head or without it. Your choice."
"115740052-0-9617";"Grandmaster, don't do this. What Tanval does, he does for the Pact."
"115740052-0-9618";"I don't care a drake about the Pact right now. Get out."
"115740052-0-9619";"It's all over."
"115740052-0-9620";"You'll regret this"
"115740052-0-9630";"Take this portal. We'll meet you on the other side."
"115740052-0-9632";"You there! A little help would be very appreciated!"
"115740052-0-9635";"Soldiers! To me for healing!"
"115740052-0-9636";"For the honor of House Indoril!"
"115740052-0-9637";"Blood for the Pact!"
"115740052-0-9639";"Hands off—that's Imperial property! Razak's Wheel shall be your grave!"
"115740052-0-9640";"There is no moisture in your angry stares."
"115740052-0-9642";"Have you heard the one about the Telvanni chef?"
"115740052-0-9643";"For comprehending the necessity of imperfection, you have earned the blessing of Sotha Sil."
"115740052-0-9644";"Stay moist, audience."
"115740052-0-9645";"Be welcome and wallow in the River of Humor."
"115740052-0-9646";"Damned Imperials! I hope scorpions lay eggs in their bellies."
"115740052-0-9647";"The tower was consumed in a fireball, you see."
"115740052-0-9648";"As the Imperials fled, I heard some of them say they were going to a dig site. A Dwarven ruin. To the southeast, maybe?"
"115740052-0-9649";"I hope Tall Papa is listening. Whatever horrors lay dormant in there? Slice the Imperials to ribbons! For the jackals to eat!"
"115740052-0-9650";"The Imperials got what was coming to them at Razak's Wheel."
"115740052-0-9651";"Wasn't it the same hero that helped the grandeya reclaim the city?"
"115740052-0-9652";"I wouldn't be surprised. Not many around these days with that sort of courage."
"115740052-0-9653";"Come! I'll show you how an Orc fights."
"115740052-0-9654";"Your spirit will give me the power I need! Together we will triumph over the Tribunal!"
"115740052-0-9655";"Freed at last … not safe here.\n\nCome. My camp is at the ruins."
"115740052-0-9658";"Quiet Down you!"
"115740052-0-9659";"No. I can't lose! Not this way! I had a deal."
"115740052-0-9660";"You're too late. Vox has the artifact. The Judgment of Veloth is hers!"
"115740052-0-9661";"Where is she? Where is this Vox?"
"115740052-0-9663";"I may fall, but you were too late to stop Magistrix Vox! She will destroy you all!"
"115740052-0-9664";"You have tried my patience long enough! Feel the wrath of Veloth's Judgment!"
"115740052-0-9665";"You have done it, my child."
"115740052-0-9667";"Bandits? Someone, help me!"
"115740052-0-9668";"I'm going to find a place to lay low. Tall Papa watch over us both."
"115740052-0-9673";"I'm going back to Cyrodiil. It's much safer there!"
"115740052-0-9674";"Mercy! Please … I won't do it again."
"115740052-0-9675";"Ha! You can't kill me!"
"115740052-0-9676";"You dare summon me? You will burn!"
"115740052-0-9677";"I yield! I will serve you for now."
"115740052-0-9678";"A mortal? How intriguing."
"115740052-0-9679";"I shall assist you, as long as it pleases me."
"115740052-0-9680";"Ah, Balreth. Again."
"115740052-0-9681";"Finish this and release me!"
"115740052-0-9682";"To me! Draw Magicka from my aura."
"115740052-0-9683";"<<1>>! The outsider disputes your challenge."
"115740052-0-9684";"Kaoc! I yield. Curse you, I yield!"
"115740052-0-9688";"Stand, supplicant. I know what you seek."
"115740052-0-9689";"We've done it! The general is dead!"
"115740052-0-9690";"Flyin', flyyin' in the sky,  cliff racer flies so high, flyinnn'"
"115740052-0-9691";"What's that noise? I hate that song!"
"115740052-0-9692";"Troll's blood, shut your trap!"
"115740052-0-9693";"Shut your fish hole!"
"115740052-0-9694";"That'll teach him."
"115740052-0-9695";"Oww. What'd I do?"
"115740052-0-9696";"How dare you summon me, Tidyn! You shall suffer for this outrage!"
"115740052-0-9697";"Now! Use the decanter to capture the weakened echo!"
"115740052-0-9698";"All right, everyone! Let's put our town back together."
"115740052-0-9699";"The ferals … they're coming."
"115740052-0-9700";"Freedom at last! General Raetus will want to thank you."
"115740052-0-9701";"Damn rats. I hate 'em!"
"115740052-0-9702";"You've betrayed us! I … my mind … no!"
"115740052-0-9703";"The undead are close behind us. We must hide the remains of the weapon. Now."
"115740052-0-9704";"The automatons are still active. We'll die down here!"
"115740052-0-9705";"We will see this done, or Molag Bal's hunters will chew on our bones."
"115740052-0-9706";"You won't live to expose me!"
"115740052-0-9707";"Goodbye and good luck!"
"115740052-0-9708";"I still think this plan is madness."
"115740052-0-9709";"Damn it! Curano is dead. The weapon will be lost forever."
"115740052-0-9710";"No, there's still hope. Ostarand will have to do it."
"115740052-0-9711";"Oblivion take you! I can't."
"115740052-0-9712";"We can still succeed. But you'll have to enact the sacrifice, my friend."
"115740052-0-9713";"Now, summon the guardians! Touch Balreth's prison to draw them in."
"115740052-0-9714";"What will you do now, worms?"
"115740052-0-9715";"Mortals, burn in my flames unending!"
"115740052-0-9716";"Daedra! Hear me! Return to your purpose."
"115740052-0-9717";"Balreth cannot walk the world of mortals. You must cage him again!"
"115740052-0-9718";"Fulfill your ancient vows. Imprison Balreth!"
"115740052-0-9719";"We obey."
"115740052-0-9720";"Forgive us, mortal master."
"115740052-0-9721";"We barely survived the last wave. Valasha's injured. We'll never hold against the dead and the constructs."
"115740052-0-9722";"Ostarand is right. You need time. I'll lead the dead away, down another branch in the tunnels."
"115740052-0-9723";"Lanath, don't! You'll never survive the swarm!"
"115740052-0-9724";"If my death buys you the time it needs … For Delodiil! And Meridia!"
"115740052-0-9726";"The Brother is bound!"
"115740052-0-9727";"My love. Ostarand. If you're going to do it, you have to do it now. I'm dying."
"115740052-0-9728";"I can't. Don't die on me Valasha! I can't do this!"
"115740052-0-9729";"You must, my love. Or Molag Bal has won …"
"115740052-0-9730";"It's what she wants Ostarand. This is why we came here. Do it."
"115740052-0-9731";"Goodbye my love … my Valasha."
"115740052-0-9734";"I can't hold them. You have to go!"
"115740052-0-9735";"I'm not leaving you!"
"115740052-0-9736";"We died when we agreed to this quest. We just kept walking a while. Hide the crystal. Hide the tome. Go!"
"115740052-0-9743";"We need to get away. Meet me outside the prison."
"115740052-0-9744";"I will open the portal. Takes just a moment."
"115740052-0-9746";"Here we go …"
"115740052-0-9747";"What in the name of Vivec do you put in this stuff?"
"115740052-0-9748";"Look, I've got clean socks!"
"115740052-0-9749";"Oh, I love you guys!"
"115740052-0-9750";"You know, I like when Valen sings."
"115740052-0-9751";"Her idea of a hot meal was burning down the tower."
"115740052-0-9755";"Avert your claws and stretch your tails."
"115740052-0-9756";"What is worse than a Dark Elf slaver's whip?"
"115740052-0-9757";"A Dark Elf slaver's wit."
"115740052-0-9758";"Dark Elves are not very funny."
"115740052-0-9759";"You are drying my scales, audience."
"115740052-0-9760";"Keep your teeth sharp."
"115740052-0-9761";"I heard … voices, just before you arrived. The past may not lay quietly here."
"115740052-0-9764";"Let's move."
"115740052-0-9765";"I'll open a portal so you can return."
"115740052-0-9766";"I'll see you down the river, comrade."
"115740052-0-9767";"Mara bless him, I made that bracelet for Nuzal."
"115740052-0-9768";"Her father made that doll from an old shirt. It always smelled like him."
"115740052-0-9769";"They put me so far from my children."
"115740052-0-9770";"My aura will restore your magic!"
"115740052-0-9772";"Hold the portal. We don't want to be trapped here."
"115740052-0-9773";"Looks like it's just us. Stay close."
"115740052-0-9774";"Stand clear of the flames."
"115740052-0-9775";"The Coral Heart can break his shield. Defend me."
"115740052-0-9776";"Now! Forward the Pact!"
"115740052-0-9777";"Fall back. I need a moment to rest."
"115740052-0-9778";"Glory for the Pact!"
"115740052-0-9779";"Fall back!"
"115740052-0-9780";"He's too powerful. We'll never break him."
"115740052-0-9781";"Finish it. Finish what we started."
"115740052-0-9782";"I think you'll have to finish him without my help, my friends."
"115740052-0-9783";"Sadal! Let's end this."
"115740052-0-9784";"For the Pact! For Garyn!"
"115740052-0-9785";"Thank you, my friends."
"115740052-0-9786";"Kyne preserve us! Another ward. Can you open it?"
"115740052-0-9787";"Protect Tanval!"
"115740052-0-9788";"Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-9789";"Cut those skeletons down. Don't let them reach Tanval."
"115740052-0-9790";"Shor's bones, he's strong. What do we do?"
"115740052-0-9791";"Tanval! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-9792";"Tanval, you old bastard!"
"115740052-0-9793";"Tanval. I'll see you in Sovngarde, my shield brother."
"115740052-0-9794";"Burn! Burn in flames."
"115740052-0-9795";"Fire will consume you."
"115740052-0-9796";"The Nedes are nought but dust and ash. Now you will join them."
"115740052-0-9797";"Scorch. Scorch and melt."
"115740052-0-9798";"Stonefalls will burn."
"115740052-0-9799";"Ha ha ha ha ha! Foolish mortal!"
"115740052-0-9800";"Taste the flames of Oblivion."
"115740052-0-9801";"Insects! Shrivel and scorch in my fire."
"115740052-0-9802";"No!"
"115740052-0-9803";"The wind dies. His shield is broken. Attack now."
"115740052-0-9804";"Summon the guardians."
"115740052-0-9805";"I'll open a portal. Time to get out of here."
"115740052-0-9806";"Lovely."
"115740052-0-9807";"What happened? He just fell over dead!"
"115740052-0-9813";"Weaklings. You think to enter my realm?"
"115740052-0-9816";"Those poor creatures. May their souls find soft mud-wallows."
"115740052-0-9817";"Get clear."
"115740052-0-9818";"Pretty confident, isn't he?"
"115740052-0-9819";"You! This travesty ends now."
"115740052-0-9821";"Wait! Before you do anything with the keystone …."
"115740052-0-9824";"I'll tell the others what happened. Thanks again!"
"115740052-0-9826";"The storm breaks. Let the lightning strike."
"115740052-0-9828";"Sithis, Lord of the Void, hear my plea! I seek to defend the honor of the Night Mother!"
"115740052-0-9829";"Spirit of the Hist, receive—Xuth!"
"115740052-0-9830";"You landstriders are all insane, and Bakkhara is the worst of you. Khajiit or no, sneaking into Dominion territory is suicide."
"115740052-0-9832";"Betrayer! Face me or my prisoner dies!"
"115740052-0-9834";"Hsst! Over here!"
"115740052-0-9835";"Strike swiftly!"
"115740052-0-9836";"Everyone, attend. I erect the spine of amusement."
"115740052-0-9837";"This performance is an ancient one. Attend. Ahem."
"115740052-0-9838";"One day, in full view of the n'wah, the mehra of Koal Canton crushed some muckspunge pulp into a netch's tentacles."
"115740052-0-9839";"In response, the morag of Koal Canton released their kwama across the anmor and poured their shein upon the ground."
"115740052-0-9840";"Only after the mehra was burned in a sujamma molag and put to the dagon was the mora safe to travel again."
"115740052-0-9841";"Xuth, that made little sense."
"115740052-0-9842";"Argonian! In the sacred name of the Mirthless, die!"
"115740052-0-9844";"Oh! That's terrible!"
"115740052-0-9845";"Your blood will cleanse this holy place!"
"115740052-0-9846";"My blood boils inside me. How can this be?"
"115740052-0-9850";"You're no Shadowscale. You know nothing of our ways!"
"115740052-0-9851";"Xuth! You are no heretic. I've dishonored the Night Mother!"
"115740052-0-9852";"Now she sees it! The terror grips her heart."
"115740052-0-9853";"I've never credited the furballs with an overabundance of intelligence. What exactly is it she expects to find at the Elden Tree?"
"115740052-0-9854";"Herbs? Relics? I have no clue. I expect to have her corpse towed back to the guild before long."
"115740052-0-9855";"How did Bakkhara even survive that trip? I hear there were Worm Cultists involved."
"115740052-0-9856";"The way I hear it, a pack of mercenaries and free-blades helped her. Fitting, for the mangy creature."
"115740052-0-9857";"Feh. Such talk makes me wonder what you say about me when my back is turned."
"115740052-0-9858";"Done! Come look what I found."
"115740052-0-9859";"My wine! Which of you vermin took it?"
"115740052-0-9860";"Husband, you work too hard. Let me help."
"115740052-0-9861";"Don't worry, dear. The potion you concocted has been a great help today."
"115740052-0-9862";"I'll help all I can. I'll gather more plants in case I need to make more potions."
"115740052-0-9863";"I'm fine!"
"115740052-0-9864";"Look at me! Look at me!"
"115740052-0-9865";"I'm the king of Ebonheart!"
"115740052-0-9866";"Whoo! Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-9867";"Listener and Speaker, I challenge the outsider. I ask for your blessing."
"115740052-0-9868";"I hear your plea."
"115740052-0-9869";"And I approve it."
"115740052-0-9870";"Then the outsider will mock the Night Mother no more."
"115740052-0-9871";"Another looter come to steal Ayleid treasures?"
"115740052-0-9872";"This temple is sacred. You shall pay for your insolence!"
"115740052-0-9873";"Supplicant! You are summoned for one final act."
"115740052-0-9876";"You won't regret letting me live. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-9877";"By Vivec, it works!"
"115740052-0-9878";"Please forgive me! I'll never do such a foolish thing again!"
"115740052-0-9879";"Foolish, selfish woman! I'm sending you to my mother's netch farm in Stonefalls."
"115740052-0-9880";"Not your mother's! Not netches! Anything but that, dear husband."
"115740052-0-9882";"What the heck does that fool think he's doing? I'm going to smash him!"
"115740052-0-9883";"Hey, you'd better be careful who you insult, you stinking sack!"
"115740052-0-9884";"If you don't shut your hole, I'll shut it for you!"
"115740052-0-9886";"That'll teach that foo!"
"115740052-0-9887";"Man, that guy really packs a punch…I mean kick"
"115740052-0-9888";"Did you hear the one about the Nord with the wooden leg?"
"115740052-0-9889";"Nords are all fat, drunk fools! Am I right?!"
"115740052-0-9891";"They wanted to know about the keystone. I told them nothing!"
"115740052-0-9892";"They kept asking the same questions over and over."
"115740052-0-9907";"Curano is right. With any luck the constructs will hold back the dead!"
"115740052-0-9910";"Those were Ancient Ones. Ayleids in a Dwemer ruin. What went on here?"
"115740052-0-9911";"A sacrifice? What did they come here to do?"
"115740052-0-9912";"Without a soul in the crystal, there will be no way to repair the weapon. It must be done, Ostarand."
"115740052-0-9913";"Giving yourself willingly to the river's current. Noble."
"115740052-0-9914";"Valasha's journal remains. Perhaps it will shed more light on what's going on here."
"115740052-0-9915";"Such bravery, in the face of certain death."
"115740052-0-9916";"The dead centurion. A fitting resting place for my Valasha."
"115740052-0-9917";"Now just have to hide the tome."
"115740052-0-9918";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-9919";"The crystal is in that steam centurion. We must destroy it!"
"115740052-0-9920";"You're too late, mortal! His soul will fuel the Mortuum Vivicus!"
"115740052-0-9921";"Foolish mercenary, he's going to get himself killed."
"115740052-0-9926";"Good. The road brought you to Ebonheart."
"115740052-0-9927";"May Vivec watch your steps."
"115740052-0-9928";"Back to the shadows, fiend."
"115740052-0-9933";"How dare you? Death for your insolence!"
"115740052-0-9934";"You can't kill the commander, filth!"
"115740052-0-9935";"The Akaviri are upon us!"
"115740052-0-9936";"To me, troops! Back, you devils!"
"115740052-0-9937";"Sorry, everyone. I lost myself for a moment there."
"115740052-0-9938";"What's that smell? Did another stinking lizard get in here?"
"115740052-0-9940";"Over here! We need help to close these portals."
"115740052-0-9941";"You've doomed us all! Prepare to die!"
"115740052-0-9950";"Destroy the intruder!"
"115740052-0-9956";"Who dares?"
"115740052-0-9957";"As you wish."
"115740052-0-9958";"Oh, come to me. Come to me, please."
"115740052-0-9960";"Please, mistress. Hit me!"
"115740052-0-9961";"<Haldyn cheers … and then dies.>"
"115740052-0-9962";"Follow me."
"115740052-0-9963";"Who are you? What do you want?"
"115740052-0-9969";"Comrade, to me!"
"115740052-0-9970";"One!"
"115740052-0-9971";"Two!"
"115740052-0-9972";"Three!"
"115740052-0-9973";"Four!"
"115740052-0-9974";"Five!"
"115740052-0-9975";"Six!"
"115740052-0-9976";"Seven!"
"115740052-0-9977";"Nine!"
"115740052-0-9978";"Ten!"
"115740052-0-9979";"Ready or not, here I come!"
"115740052-0-9980";"I give up!"
"115740052-0-9981";"Found you! Let's play again!"
"115740052-0-9982";"Eight!"
"115740052-0-9983";"Now, let's get started…"
"115740052-0-9985";"I feel the Eye upon me. Praise to the Eye!"
"115740052-0-9986";"Yes, yes. Keep to the shadows where no flame burns."
"115740052-0-9987";"The books, the books. Oh, the sweet books."
"115740052-0-9989";"You're here. Veloth be praised."
"115740052-0-9993";"Save Ja-Reet. He's in that hut over there."
"115740052-0-9997";"Excellent. Send the Diadem to my master. Let it pass beyond the veil."
"115740052-0-9998";"I take my leave.Travel in the sight of the Eye."
"115740052-0-10000";"Stay sharp!"
"115740052-0-10001";"Aelif will start the ritual."
"115740052-0-10003";"Who summons me?"
"115740052-0-10004";"Hush, spirit. Aelif will ask the question."
"115740052-0-10005";"You got me!"
"115740052-0-10006";"You have 60 seconds to defeat me punk!"
"115740052-0-10007";"Another one down!"
"115740052-0-10008";"Back off! Only Blacksails are allowed on the ship!"
"115740052-0-10011";"What do you wish to know?"
"115740052-0-10012";"I will tell you what I can."
"115740052-0-10013";"Aelif demands the name of your murderer."
"115740052-0-10014";"Who killed you, Jofnir?"
"115740052-0-10015";"It was the Argonian, my subordinate, Sees-All-Colors."
"115740052-0-10016";"This one knew it would be so."
"115740052-0-10017";"Begone, spirit. Aelif is done with you."
"115740052-0-10018";"I have done as you asked. Release me to walk in Sovngarde."
"115740052-0-10019";"Go. Aelif will call for you again, soon."
"115740052-0-10020";"Sovngarde indeed."
"115740052-0-10021";"Wait! Don't go in! Stop!"
"115740052-0-10024";"Can't wait any longer! I'm going in!"
"115740052-0-10026";"Come forth, Echo of Vox! Come forth, vile parasite! Face your doom!"
"115740052-0-10027";"Ease up, now. The fire is very close."
"115740052-0-10028";"Give us some more, but not too much. We are not quite there yet."
"115740052-0-10029";"Let the fire loose, now. Give it all you can!"
"115740052-0-10030";"It is too hot, comrade! Cool it down with the lever. Release the pressure!"
"115740052-0-10031";"Anyone could be a skin-stealer. Anyone!"
"115740052-0-10032";"You'll never find all of us. We're everywhere!"
"115740052-0-10033";"My kind of answer. Let them come!"
"115740052-0-10034";"As I suspected, your sensitivity is impressive. You could see the pattern. Now I know you can help us against the coming danger."
"115740052-0-10035";"That … did not sound good."
"115740052-0-10036";"About time we got some backup, eh?"
"115740052-0-10037";"We will not fail you!"
"115740052-0-10038";"That's the fire I'm looking for! Stand back. I shall prepare the core."
"115740052-0-10039";"We're routed! Fall back!"
"115740052-0-10040";"Now we're there! Almost done, comrade. Give me a large fire. Make it twice as hot as the last one."
"115740052-0-10041";"For the Chimer! For Veloth!"
"115740052-0-10044";"What in Sovngarde?"
"115740052-0-10045";"That's it. The fire is perfect. Stendarr smiles upon us both!"
"115740052-0-10046";"Yield to the power of the Prince of Destruction!"
"115740052-0-10047";"I shall break your will!"
"115740052-0-10048";"Your master is weak! Ours is all-powerful!"
"115740052-0-10049";"I tried so hard to prevent this bloodshed."
"115740052-0-10050";"Begone, wretch! Now you will meet the same fate!"
"115740052-0-10052";"Cease your meddling, scum! The Redguard's soul will fuel the Mortuum Vivicus. Nothing you can do can stop it!"
"115740052-0-10053";"This is ridiculous. How can there be fish in there? What would they eat?"
"115740052-0-10054";"Run!"
"115740052-0-10055";"That was impressive! Sort of, I mean."
"115740052-0-10056";"Save yourself!"
"115740052-0-10057";"B'vek's buttocks! What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-10058";"Kill it! Don't let it eat me!"
"115740052-0-10059";"I think that counts as a success. Thanks, f'lah."
"115740052-0-10060";"I helped to find this place, years ago … Stendarr's will. Comrade, this news is disquieting."
"115740052-0-10061";"I am glad you are here with us. I've made preparations to work the Prismatic crystal, to reforge the weapon from the time of the Ancients."
"115740052-0-10062";"In truth, I thought this weapon would just be a powerful symbol. It seems we have great need of this important relic."
"115740052-0-10063";"Welcome to the Earth Forge! Quite a sight, is it not?"
"115740052-0-10067";"Ah, Valeyn, you walked right into my trap! Wait, who are you?"
"115740052-0-10068";"Another student? Another new Maulborn soldier …."
"115740052-0-10071";"Oh, good, you're finally awake!"
"115740052-0-10072";"Ahh! Leave me alone. Don't hurt me."
"115740052-0-10073";"Hee hee hee!"
"115740052-0-10074";"Fools! Do you truly think you could hide that trinket from the God of Schemes?"
"115740052-0-10075";"The people of Abagarlas serve me even in death! My devoted, kill them! Kill them and bring me the crystal."
"115740052-0-10076";"That blasphemy must not be allowed to be reforged! Bring that crystal to Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-10077";"Remember this day, mewling wretches. My followers serve me even in death."
"115740052-0-10078";"Back away from gate. Coming through!"
"115740052-0-10079";"Master send me. Said to rescue you."
"115740052-0-10080";"Time to go! I come back for other two later."
"115740052-0-10081";"Oh, you need pretty girl now? Wait, wait. One second."
"115740052-0-10082";"I summon nasty Elf now."
"115740052-0-10083";"Valeyn said you would come. Now you die, and I leave with my new army."
"115740052-0-10084";"Hurry! You must destroy the Jagged Lens."
"115740052-0-10085";"I will not forget you, my friend."
"115740052-0-10086";"Kind stranger! Kazdi begs you release her before hungry snake-ladies return!"
"115740052-0-10087";"He lied! You want the Fang!"
"115740052-0-10088";"No! They've left Kazdi to die. Curse Brute-vitar!"
"115740052-0-10089";"It's gone. I'm free."
"115740052-0-10090";"Now I'll need a larger fire, comrade! Double the heat of the last one."
"115740052-0-10091";"Now we need an even hotter fire, the largest yet. Twice the size of the last one!"
"115740052-0-10092";"We've done it. Very well done, comrade!"
"115740052-0-10093";"Another one for the fires. Taste my power!"
"115740052-0-10094";"What have I done to my ship?"
"115740052-0-10095";"Follow, comrade."
"115740052-0-10096";"Jofnir visits a remote Dwemer ruin just before his death. No coincidence."
"115740052-0-10097";"And now the guild openly opposes a Daedric Prince! Risky, risky."
"115740052-0-10098";"To throw the guild against such power. Foolish."
"115740052-0-10099";"This one remembers when we fought Goblins, bandits."
"115740052-0-10100";"Small contracts. ""One and done,"" yes?"
"115740052-0-10101";"Almost there. Be on your guard."
"115740052-0-10102";"I knew it! The beam unlocked that huge door. Go check it out."
"115740052-0-10103";"And here we are. Ragnthar."
"115740052-0-10104";"This one will just be a moment."
"115740052-0-10105";"The sound of gears … watch yourself!"
"115740052-0-10106";"Seek Ja-Reet's memories. Say what should have been said."
"115740052-0-10107";"You've untangled memories. The Hist blesses you."
"115740052-0-10108";"Come. Meet me beneath the Hist tree."
"115740052-0-10109";"This one cannot wait to taste the air in Ragnthar."
"115740052-0-10112";"Enough! Enough, curse you! I yield!"
"115740052-0-10113";"The witch gets her way. I'll stick to the terms of our deal."
"115740052-0-10116";"Crow Mother sent you, didn't she? I'm not staying in this cursed place."
"115740052-0-10117";"I can't stand to be alone anymore. I'll keep you both here for eternity."
"115740052-0-10118";"At last! I owe you my life, stranger. Is my son here?"
"115740052-0-10119";"I'm going to take what I need and find my son. Farewell."
"115740052-0-10120";"You have failed me, Doshia."
"115740052-0-10121";"Build me a small fire first, and I shall tell you when you are close."
"115740052-0-10122";"Leave me alone, you cursed hag."
"115740052-0-10123";"They mean to kill us both, my love. I won't let them hurt you!"
"115740052-0-10126";"I hear the Fang. It calls to me."
"115740052-0-10127";"Wuff"
"115740052-0-10128";"There you are. What did you find out?"
"115740052-0-10129";"Blasted portal magic. So temperamental."
"115740052-0-10130";"A toll! A toll! A toll for the featherless one."
"115740052-0-10133";"The featherless has paid the toll. Let this be known throughout the wood!"
"115740052-0-10136";"I've been waiting for this my entire life."
"115740052-0-10137";"Me, too, Lena. I want to learn how to unleash my inner powers."
"115740052-0-10138";"Ah, but before we unleash we must learn to control."
"115740052-0-10139";"Of course, Hadmar. Whatever you say, Hadmar."
"115740052-0-10140";"Help! The cat's after me!"
"115740052-0-10141";"Intruder! Are you here to take him away from me?"
"115740052-0-10143";"If they notice you, hide and put the disguise back on."
"115740052-0-10144";"I yield! Take the invitation and leave me alone."
"115740052-0-10145";"To the center."
"115740052-0-10146";"First, we attune your spirit to Shalidor's."
"115740052-0-10147";"Isn't this better, my love? No more bickering?"
"115740052-0-10148";"Bickering? I think there will be a lot of bickering when my son gets here."
"115740052-0-10149";"Ready. When you're set, use the orb before you."
"115740052-0-10150";"You have a son? I can't wait to meet him. He can stay here with us. There's plenty of room."
"115740052-0-10151";"Great. Just great."
"115740052-0-10154";"Help!"
"115740052-0-10155";"Can anyone hear me?"
"115740052-0-10156";"I'm not dead!"
"115740052-0-10157";"Help!"
"115740052-0-10158";"Can anyone hear me?"
"115740052-0-10159";"I'm not dead!"
"115740052-0-10160";"A spirit has been destroyed! Protect them!"
"115740052-0-10161";"Thank you for freeing me."
"115740052-0-10162";"Thank you for freeing me."
"115740052-0-10164";"The bards of Skyrim will sing this tale for years!"
"115740052-0-10165";"Defend me, friend! The brandy won't keep the demons away!"
"115740052-0-10166";"Gather 'round all who'd hear."
"115740052-0-10167";"The story I have to tell."
"115740052-0-10168";"About Ysgramor, greatest of us all."
"115740052-0-10169";"Did it work? Can I drink again?"
"115740052-0-10170";"It worked, friend. Come on and see!"
"115740052-0-10171";"Kwama Queens are pretty, Kwama Queens are kind. All the kwama eggs here, they're mine, mine, MINE!"
"115740052-0-10172";"Will anyone help me?"
"115740052-0-10173";"Damn Supernal Dreamers."
"115740052-0-10174";"Help! I've been robbed!"
"115740052-0-10176";"I've been robbed!"
"115740052-0-10177";"You there!"
"115740052-0-10178";"I miss my crystals."
"115740052-0-10181";"<cough> <cough>"
"115740052-0-10182";"The Kwama Queen is … dead … long live … the Kwama … ack!"
"115740052-0-10183";"I can take a life from afar as if swatting a fly. Run. Run far away."
"115740052-0-10185";"I'm … I'm changing! You did this to us!"
"115740052-0-10187";"I'm not going that way."
"115740052-0-10188";"No … please … I don't want to!"
"115740052-0-10189";"No! It burns!"
"115740052-0-10190";"Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
"115740052-0-10191";"I can't wait to see the look on his face! If it's precious enough, I might hang it on the wall."
"115740052-0-10192";"What's the meaning of this? Sheogorath!"
"115740052-0-10193";"You remembered!\n\nAh, Shalidor. You never write. You never visit."
"115740052-0-10194";"I put a tiny curse on these books. Just a small one!\n\nLong story short, Shal: you can never read these books."
"115740052-0-10195";"Just now, I made a deal with your lackey here. How long have you wanted those books? Eternity?"
"115740052-0-10196";"Your ""deals"" are hardly fair. What farce have you contrived this time?"

"115740052-0-10198";"Curse you, Mad God!"
"115740052-0-10199";"Boring! Be more imaginative, Shal. Like, ""Curse you, Mad God! May you become cheese eternally gnawed by skeevers!""\n\nUnfortunately, I have no more time for constructive criticism. Do stay in touch!"
"115740052-0-10205";"Come to me, mortal. This is the way in."
"115740052-0-10206";"You shouldn't go out again. The swamp has gone mad."
"115740052-0-10207";"Someone has to. The Tree-Minder needs us."
"115740052-0-10208";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-10209";"This must be the familiar the Arch-Mage told us about."
"115740052-0-10210";"shudders and cracks, releasing hissing fumes."
"115740052-0-10211";"Maybe so, but you're injured."
"115740052-0-10212";"We have to get out there, or the village is done for!"
"115740052-0-10213";"There's a book on the prison warden's desk. That may be it."
"115740052-0-10214";"Hsst! Over here!"
"115740052-0-10215";"That's not the way to the prison warden's office."
"115740052-0-10216";"You are persistent, aren't you."
"115740052-0-10217";"What stirred up the bog beasts?"
"115740052-0-10218";"I don't know, but we'd better get back out there."
"115740052-0-10219";"is reasonably content."

"115740052-0-10225";"is so happy."
"115740052-0-10226";"is so happy to be freed."
"115740052-0-10227";"is relieved to be free."
"115740052-0-10231";"My poor children and I deserve a better resting place."
"115740052-0-10232";"Hurry, then. We lost two more to the stranglers."
"115740052-0-10233";"I'll do what I can."
"115740052-0-10234";"Use these harps to teach me the tune."
"115740052-0-10235";"Ha! Kazdi escapes!"
"115740052-0-10238";"Don't forget to light the brazier! Ah, yah daft fool."
"115740052-0-10241";"My soul's on fire!"
"115740052-0-10242";"Can I help you?"
"115740052-0-10243";"I'll think of him as I read this."
"115740052-0-10247";"She screamed so softly when she died."
"115740052-0-10248";"Did you see all the blood?"
"115740052-0-10252";"Door is locked, generous one."
"115740052-0-10254";"<<1>> said I'd find you inside, but reported nothing of your Dominion prisoner."
"115740052-0-10255";"No! I've nearly unlocked its secret!"
"115740052-0-10256";"Another lizard shall sustain me!"
"115740052-0-10257";"You won't end my righteous work!"
"115740052-0-10258";"I hear you up there! Get down here and help me!"
"115740052-0-10259";"You'll make a fine test subject!"
"115740052-0-10261";"Here is some dialogue."
"115740052-0-10262";"We should feed <<1>> to wamasu. But for now, let's recover <<A:2>>."
"115740052-0-10263";"Xuth! What has that monster done to <<A:1>>?"
"115740052-0-10264";"Let's keep moving!"
"115740052-0-10265";"Look at this! Give me a moment …."
"115740052-0-10266";"This is extraordinary! If I'm reading this correctly, the Na-Totambu are buried here! Those were the ancient kings of Yokuda!"
"115740052-0-10268";"I think I know what we need to do. Come speak to me when you're ready."
"115740052-0-10271";"Yokudan constructions frequently featured descriptive tablets for pilgrims. With any luck we'll find one still intact."
"115740052-0-10273";"Out here! It's me, Shalan. Help! I'm surrounded!"
"115740052-0-10274";"Let's go!"
"115740052-0-10275";"No! Kazdi escapes!"
"115740052-0-10277";"No. Kazdi cannot survive in a cage!"
"115740052-0-10279";"Kazdi is free to go? Truly?"
"115740052-0-10281";"Kazdi will not forget. A thousand blessings upon you!"
"115740052-0-10282";"Can you help an Argonian find his lost brother?"
"115740052-0-10289";"Remarkable. Just remarkable!"
"115740052-0-10297";"Let's get this done."
"115740052-0-10299";"You have done well, but you must still prove yourself worthy to claim the Cartulary."
"115740052-0-10301";"The Cartulary is yours to claim. Farewell, wanderer. We shall not meet again."
"115740052-0-10309";"We head up from here."
"115740052-0-10310";"Through here waits the other stone."
"115740052-0-10311";"This isn't my land. I need to find my way home."
"115740052-0-10312";"Keep going! I'll watch your back. \n\nNow you face Belron, Worms! Die!"
"115740052-0-10313";"He told me I could go home. I only have to find the way."
"115740052-0-10314";"Hello? Are you lost, too?"
"115740052-0-10315";"You have a rare mind, Valaste. Not once in a century is a Mer with your talent born. We have accepted your application to join our august and storied Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-10316";"I grow tired of excuses, Nahrina. When will Tavo return?"
"115740052-0-10317";"Pleasure doing business with you, friend. Sorry for your loss, Nahrina."
"115740052-0-10319";"Disrupt the ritual, I'll keep him busy."
"115740052-0-10320";"Be on guard."
"115740052-0-10321";"Good riddance, Thragnar the Failure! To freedom!"
"115740052-0-10322";"Thanks, friend. See the boss for your reward."
"115740052-0-10323";"Die!"
"115740052-0-10324";"Let's get back to the surface."
"115740052-0-10325";"My shield, lost … my blade, shattered! What bears a knight with missing means? Only despair …."
"115740052-0-10326";"My sword and shield, in another's hands? A theft unparalleled! Honor demands satisfaction, in the name of my liege!"
"115740052-0-10328";"I deny your claim upon me. Begone, foul trickster!"
"115740052-0-10329";"How dare you stand in my presence! Show deference to your new liege lord!"
"115740052-0-10331";"Fine! Leave the Chateau. I didn't like you anyway!"
"115740052-0-10337";"<<1>> found another to help? Praise Sithis."
"115740052-0-10338";"Another body. Thanks for lending your sight."
"115740052-0-10339";"<<1>> regains his spirits. Good work, outsider."
"115740052-0-10340";"I slipped <<1>> past the lamias. Go, speak to him."
"115740052-0-10341";"Would you behold a shortcut?"
"115740052-0-10342";"Fine, then! My advocate will be contacting you about this!"
"115740052-0-10343";"I'll show myself out. But I'm not taking that dreadful portal!"
"115740052-0-10344";"I bring memories of your aid to the Hist."
"115740052-0-10346";"I hear the Hist! Am I free?"
"115740052-0-10347";"You've led me back to moisture. Hist be with you."
"115740052-0-10348";"I rejoin my egg-siblings in the Hist."
"115740052-0-10349";"Nothing's left. No hope. No hope at all."
"115740052-0-10352";"Well done! The family would be so proud, if you hadn't already murdered most of them."
"115740052-0-10355";"Wait, come back!"
"115740052-0-10358";"I knew it. I was right in choosing you."
"115740052-0-10359";"Close the portal, if you can. Though you may want to deal with those Scamps first."
"115740052-0-10360";"The portal will take a moment to destabilize. In the meantime, mind the angry Daedra."
"115740052-0-10362";"Interesting. Well, I suppose."
"115740052-0-10363";"This one's frozen! Is it someone you know?\n\nGuess who I am, and I might let him go."
"115740052-0-10364";"Our brother's pain won't relent, flesh-walker. We abjure him from the Hist!"
"115740052-0-10365";"Fish aren't biting today. Not even a nibble."
"115740052-0-10366";"I wish Miss Trynhild would give me a nibble."
"115740052-0-10367";"You're such a dog, Otroggar."
"115740052-0-10368";"That's offensive. I'm clearly a stallion."
"115740052-0-10369";"So what about you and Littrek, eh?"
"115740052-0-10370";"Littrek's a child. And he smells of pigs."
"115740052-0-10371";"It's a small island, Svilda. Can't be choosy."
"115740052-0-10372";"It's big enough for me."
"115740052-0-10373";"""Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart…."""
"115740052-0-10374";"Oh, for Kyne's sake. Just stop."
"115740052-0-10375";"What? I'm a good singer!"
"115740052-0-10376";"I thought you were slaughtering a goose."
"115740052-0-10377";"How rude! Digging through my things. What manners!"
"115740052-0-10378";"Keep walking! There couldn't possibly be traps."
"115740052-0-10379";"You'll make a lovely squirrel. So inquisitive!"
"115740052-0-10380";"Astounding! You've accomplished the impossible! Leaping small rocks!"
"115740052-0-10381";"My friends! You found them! I have so many.\n\nLook around. Meet them all."
"115740052-0-10382";"Doesn't Arawe look splendid? Always so shiny."
"115740052-0-10383";"This is Oriell. We're brothers! I'm better looking."
"115740052-0-10384";"Tarak of the Silver Claw! Always joking. He's much happier as a vase."
"115740052-0-10386";"No! You monster!"
"115740052-0-10387";"Why? Why?"
"115740052-0-10388";"Hey! Get out of there, pig!"
"115740052-0-10393";"Please! They've taken my husband!"
"115740052-0-10394";"Another stranger swims into our wallow."
"115740052-0-10398";"This way."
"115740052-0-10399";"Why do you fight, you milk-drinking dogs?"
"115740052-0-10401";"Eiman!"
"115740052-0-10402";"You're lucky I came at all."
"115740052-0-10403";"Don't call me Rolly."
"115740052-0-10404";"Go in there again, and I'll leave you to rot."
"115740052-0-10405";"We're going. Dumb ox."
"115740052-0-10406";"Rolly! You came to save me!"
"115740052-0-10407";"You should've seen it, Rolly. That cave is incredible."
"115740052-0-10408";"He had treasures! He was child-sized, like an evil baby man."
"115740052-0-10409";"You don't have to tell me twice."
"115740052-0-10410";"Ha ha! Got you! Try again."
"115740052-0-10411";"Ooh, so close!"
"115740052-0-10412";"Hey, over here! Ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-10413";"What have you got, clever squirrel? Do you have a guess?"
"115740052-0-10414";"Here I am! Or am I here? \n\nGuess wrong, and you're mine, my dear."
"115740052-0-10415";"No fair!"
"115740052-0-10416";"This is where I keep my friends. Go on. Introduce yourself."
"115740052-0-10418";"Mad God! We had a deal!"
"115740052-0-10419";"And here's your island, just as we agreed."
"115740052-0-10421";"You'll never defeat the Covenant!"
"115740052-0-10422";"This is not what we agreed to, Mad God! Leave this place."
"115740052-0-10423";"Vicecanon? Is everything all right?"
"115740052-0-10424";"Careful, mage. Remember who you're talking to."
"115740052-0-10425";"The <<A:1>> holds her in some form of trance. We must wake her!"
"115740052-0-10426";"Our mortal friend has arrived! Be quiet now, Shally. Adults talking."
"115740052-0-10427";"By the Egg!"
"115740052-0-10428";"Look up, greedy squirrel! See something shiny? Don't break your neck!"
"115740052-0-10429";"Who are you? Please, don't hurt me. \n\nGuards! Intruder!"
"115740052-0-10430";"I'll meet you on the other side of that door."
"115740052-0-10431";"Darj, bring them through."
"115740052-0-10432";"An intruder! Guard the thrall!"
"115740052-0-10433";"Fool! You serve Molag Bal well today by destroying Meridia's servant!"
"115740052-0-10434";"Idiot! Must I do everything? In Molag Bal's name, die!"
"115740052-0-10436";"Go! Close the portals! I will see this done."
"115740052-0-10437";"You've done it! Did you feel the air shift?"
"115740052-0-10438";"We must do something."
"115740052-0-10439";"Hmm. There's something here, but I can't put my claw on it. No matter."
"115740052-0-10440";"It seems so real, doesn't it? You'd think we weren't in a dream."
"115740052-0-10441";"I recognize those nests, those houses. I've seen them in Shadowfen … but where?"
"115740052-0-10443";"We learned about this portal from Sheogorath's books. At least something useful was gleaned from reading all that nonsense.\n\nNow stand back!"
"115740052-0-10444";"I shall return you to Tamriel."
"115740052-0-10445";"That crystal is entrancing Lyris. You must break the spell!"
"115740052-0-10446";"The Black Forge is ahead, but the way is barred. \n\nHurry—I cannot keep his eyes off you for long."
"115740052-0-10447";"Molag Bal is strong—but for the moment, his gaze is on me. Find Lyris, and quickly."
"115740052-0-10448";"He suspects. I cannot hold his attention any longer. I shall open a rift in Oblivion ahead. Run!"
"115740052-0-10449";"You! Your interference will cost you your flesh as well as your soul."
"115740052-0-10450";"Mr. Flint! Wake the crew!"
"115740052-0-10452";"They're coming for my treasure, Mr. Flint!"
"115740052-0-10455";"Looking for someone who likes travel! And bogs!"
"115740052-0-10458";"You can do this adept. You've proven yourself, that you're up to this. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-10459";"All this time, you never suspected me! Molag Bal truly is the master of lies!"
"115740052-0-10462";"The time is right to reclaim a lost friend."
"115740052-0-10464";"You're up! Good. Go let Captain Rana know."
"115740052-0-10465";"Look! A puny! Arga gonna eats it!"
"115740052-0-10466";"No fair! You ates the last one!"
"115740052-0-10467";"A boon for my servant. Receive my power and destroy them!"
"115740052-0-10468";"We have to evacuate."
"115740052-0-10469";"We must make sure everyone's accounted for."
"115740052-0-10470";"I want everyone to partner up. Even you, Mathor."
"115740052-0-10471";"Rana has no idea what she's doing."
"115740052-0-10472";"Did I ever risk your lives like this?"
"115740052-0-10473";"No one gets left behind."
"115740052-0-10474";"Everyone stay calm. We've done all this before."
"115740052-0-10475";"We stick together in the Barrow, we'll have no trouble."
"115740052-0-10476";"The dead can hurt you. Stay with Captain Rana."
"115740052-0-10478";"What do you think you're doing? Stop That!"
"115740052-0-10479";"Sever her connections to Molag Bal! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-10480";"Leave that be! That's private!"
"115740052-0-10483";"Be careful. I sense powerful spells at work here."
"115740052-0-10484";"They should have been back by now. Captain Alhana said they'd meet us here after an evening of prayer, right?"
"115740052-0-10485";"That's what she said, but I don't see them. Maybe what the traveling merchant said is true."
"115740052-0-10492";"High Rock and Hammerfell!"
"115740052-0-10494";"Aelif, you miserable failure! You are not worthy of my gifts!"
"115740052-0-10500";"Renounce your barbarian gods!"
"115740052-0-10501";"The wind blows hot today."
"115740052-0-10507";"Embrace the Tribunal!"
"115740052-0-10508";"Embrace them? I've never even met them."
"115740052-0-10509";"The south gate … Denskar and Littrek are in over their heads."
"115740052-0-10510";"Unbelievers will be smitten!"
"115740052-0-10511";"I don't think that's the word you were looking for."
"115740052-0-10517";"Sergeant Seyne. You must help Seyne!"
"115740052-0-10520";"I'm all right. Go find Trynhild and Rana. They're on the other side of the docks."
"115740052-0-10523";"Does the wind carry any news?"
"115740052-0-10524";"None you couldn't scent yourself."
"115740052-0-10525";"No word of Covenant invasion, then?"
"115740052-0-10526";"No, but one can feel the thunder building."
"115740052-0-10527";"We lost another guar today."
"115740052-0-10528";"Was it that same alit?"
"115740052-0-10529";"I think so. No footprints, but the tooth marks seemed right."
"115740052-0-10530";"After the Daggers leave, you and I will hunt it."
"115740052-0-10531";"How many guar does Mother think we can spare?"
"115740052-0-10532";"They're only going to Davon's Watch."
"115740052-0-10533";"But we've lost so many to predators this year."
"115740052-0-10534";"We'll get them back once the refugees are safe."
"115740052-0-10535";"<Drunken singing>"
"115740052-0-10537";"Blood for the Pact!"
"115740052-0-10542";"Well fought! Meet me outside."
"115740052-0-10545";"Do you have any guar intestines?"
"115740052-0-10546";"You plan to cook them or read them?"
"115740052-0-10547";"It's for the meal. Unless you wanted a reading?"
"115740052-0-10548";"Hrrk. No, thanks. I'd prefer to ask tea leaves."
"115740052-0-10549";"Don't you think Fetches-Glitter acts strange?"
"115740052-0-10550";"Only when he's talking to you."
"115740052-0-10551";"Why does he always bring me little gifts?"
"115740052-0-10552";"That's how Dark Elves woo their mates. Remember?"
"115740052-0-10553";"But we're not Elves. It's not our way."
"115740052-0-10554";"We were all raised in slave camps. What's ""our way""?"
"115740052-0-10555";"I heard you tossing and turning last night."
"115740052-0-10556";"It's nothing. Just dreams."
"115740052-0-10557";"About the plantation?"
"115740052-0-10558";"You never wake up feeling the lashes again?"
"115740052-0-10559";"You have to help Captain Rana."
"115740052-0-10560";"Get going. I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-10563";"Move, you corpulent cretin! Get your bulk clear of the chute!"
"115740052-0-10564";"Next load is ready! Get a move on, ogrim!"
"115740052-0-10565";"I haven't climbed through a window since I was a young girl. They've gotten smaller."
"115740052-0-10566";"Ouch!"
"115740052-0-10567";"Ugh, my head is killing me. Didn't think I drank that much"
"115740052-0-10568";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-10569";"Kazok's axe hungers for blood!"
"115740052-0-10592";"By the Ebony Blade, this is it. We've found the shrine!"
"115740052-0-10608";"Stop the mortal!"
"115740052-0-10610";"Kill the mortal bloodsack!"
"115740052-0-10612";"Covenant mages are opening portals inside the fort!"
"115740052-0-10615";"I saw the whole thing. Well done! I wish I could have helped, but you had everything under control."
"115740052-0-10617";"No! No freedom for them! These fetchers will suffer for killing my men!"
"115740052-0-10618";"Time for a thumpin!"
"115740052-0-10619";"Rraagh! Get out of my head!"
"115740052-0-10629";"I'm going to make you suffer for that."
"115740052-0-10630";"Memories remain tangled. This weakens our roots."
"115740052-0-10632";"What's going on over here?"
"115740052-0-10633";"We go now to a secret passage. It is, really, a storage tunnel. But today, it is a secret from the Covenant."
"115740052-0-10634";"Quiet! Someone's coming!"
"115740052-0-10635";"I feel like I'm being torn apart! Aarghh!"
"115740052-0-10636";"You don't feel the pain that I have suffered."
"115740052-0-10637";"Kyne has forsaken us. She let our children die. Now we'll take her children as our own!"
"115740052-0-10638";"I hoped to find you over here."
"115740052-0-10642";"Kyne's followers have no place here! This grove belongs to us now. We'll use these people as we see fit."
"115740052-0-10643";"Stop, please! Leave her alone!"
"115740052-0-10644";"Oh, mother! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-10645";"My son! You're alive! I thought I lost you."
"115740052-0-10646";"Kyne, hear my prayers. My mother turned away from you, but she was wrong. She acted as she did because of her grief."
"115740052-0-10647";"She devoted her life to you. If you restore her, I'll return to the war. I'll take up my weapon to fight for your honor, and our people, once more."
"115740052-0-10648";"Please, goddess. I lost my brother and my father. Don't take my mother from me as well."
"115740052-0-10654";"Where is that confounded cook? I wonder if he's forgotten my drink order."
"115740052-0-10655";"That's not right."
"115740052-0-10656";"Not the effect I was looking for."
"115740052-0-10657";"Oh, my. That's pleasant."
"115740052-0-10658";"<Davilia coughs.>"
"115740052-0-10659";"Please, help me get to safety."
"115740052-0-10661";"The Covenant is upon us!"
"115740052-0-10662";"The Daggers are murdering us."
"115740052-0-10663";"To arms! The Covenant is here!"
"115740052-0-10664";"Hurry! We must warn Davon's Watch."
"115740052-0-10665";"Someone help me, please!"
"115740052-0-10666";"I just know the netch will help turn the tide of battle."
"115740052-0-10669";"You will fall!"
"115740052-0-10678";"What? What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-10679";"Form up! Hold the line!"
"115740052-0-10680";"Destroy that thing! Hack it apart!"
"115740052-0-10681";"Back, foul demon!"
"115740052-0-10682";"Captain, wait!"
"115740052-0-10683";"I didn't sign up for this!"
"115740052-0-10684";"Ancestors, preserve us."
"115740052-0-10685";"Daedra! Face me! Or are you afraid?"
"115740052-0-10686";"That's not possible…"
"115740052-0-10692";"Hold your ground!"
"115740052-0-10696";"Check on my wife. Aera's in the tower, just over there."
"115740052-0-10703";"Indrasa? What have you heard about the Covenant attack?"
"115740052-0-10704";"Nothing since the residential quarter was bombarded."
"115740052-0-10705";"They're just over the wall, huh?"
"115740052-0-10706";"If you see a ladder, run."
"115740052-0-10707";"There's been a new push. They're inside the walls!"
"115740052-0-10708";"Nothing since the army pushed them back."
"115740052-0-10709";"What? Should we evacuate?"
"115740052-0-10710";"I heard the Hero of Bal Foyen helped them!"
"115740052-0-10711";"I'm staying. Give me your best dagger."
"115740052-0-10712";"Bal Foyen? That's the Argonian mudhole to the east, yes?"
"115740052-0-10713";"Think we'll launch a counterstrike against the Covenant?"
"115740052-0-10714";"Don't we always?"
"115740052-0-10715";"Sometimes Mother Almalexia forbids it."
"115740052-0-10716";"Sometimes Lord Vivec demands it. Best to leave such decisions to the gods."
"115740052-0-10717";"What are you doing for dinner tomorrow?"
"115740052-0-10718";"Hmm. I thought I'd try Uveran's Cornerclub."
"115740052-0-10719";"My father got a fine guar steak from Fetches-Glitter."
"115740052-0-10720";"From the Argonian? I hope it doesn't poison you."
"115740052-0-10724";"That Vixen is a nice looking Dunmer, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-10725";"Sure, but be careful what you say, she's deadly!"
"115740052-0-10726";"She doesn't scare me. I'm just the Nord to tame her!"
"115740052-0-10727";"Hurry, friend. Bal Foyen is under attack!"
"115740052-0-10735";"Horker! Get back here!"
"115740052-0-10736";"Horker! To me!"
"115740052-0-10737";"Heel, boy!"
"115740052-0-10739";"I need swords on my walls, Sergeant. Arm the peasants if you have to."
"115740052-0-10740";"Help me hold off these Daggers while the fishermen get away."
"115740052-0-10741";"You're not one of my soldiers! Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-10742";"Please stay on the customer side of the counter."
"115740052-0-10743";"Customers aren't allowed back here."
"115740052-0-10744";"If you insist on breaking the rules, I'll have to call the guards."
"115740052-0-10745";"We appreciate your custom."
"115740052-0-10746";"Please come again."
"115740052-0-10748";"You have fulfilled your purpose. Well done, worm."
"115740052-0-10750";"What's happening? Everything fades away!"
"115740052-0-10751";"Small one, leave the rot-memory. Come to us and speak."
"115740052-0-10752";"Nela! Another mead."
"115740052-0-10753";"Girl! More shein."
"115740052-0-10754";"Could I get a sujamma over here?"
"115740052-0-10755";"Here you are, Swannie."
"115740052-0-10756";"Your esteemed ladyship."
"115740052-0-10757";"You throw it up, you lick it up."
"115740052-0-10758";"Cursed undead. They're everywhere!"
"115740052-0-10759";"Someone's got to light the signal fire."
"115740052-0-10760";"It's time to make a tough choice."
"115740052-0-10761";"All able hands are ordered to report to Darj."
"115740052-0-10762";"We're going to need all the help we can get."
"115740052-0-10764";"We must make sure that word of the Covenant reached Davon's Watch."
"115740052-0-10765";"We must make sure that word of the Covenant reached Davon's Watch."
"115740052-0-10766";"I thank you for your service, mortal. Your assistance has been … noted."
"115740052-0-10767";"Please! You have to help me!"
"115740052-0-10768";"You did it! The guardians are here! What are they waiting for?"
"115740052-0-10769";"Again!"
"115740052-0-10770";"Back to it."
"115740052-0-10771";"No weakness. No breaks."
"115740052-0-10772";"I must return to my training."
"115740052-0-10773";"You're too late, weakling! Fildgor has his prize. He's in Cradlecrush by now!"
"115740052-0-10774";"Soldier. What's the mood of the people?"
"115740052-0-10775";"A new caretaker now carries the relics from the royal tombs. I hope you prove to be better at the job than this despicable Nord."
"115740052-0-10776";"Your prowess is impressive, champion. Come up here so that—"
"115740052-0-10777";"They're worried about Ash Mountain, serjo."
"115740052-0-10778";"Mountains also spit fire in Skyrim. We don't worry about it."
"115740052-0-10779";"With respect, the volcanoes of Morrowind are … different."
"115740052-0-10780";"Soldier. What's this rumor about Ash Mountain?"
"115740052-0-10781";"Something about an ancient magical weapon, serjo."
"115740052-0-10782";"So what? It's broken now? Stolen by the Covenant?"
"115740052-0-10783";"Sealed, serjo. By the Indorils and the Hero of Bal Foyen."
"115740052-0-10784";"The Goblins have captured Gar. They took him into a cave near the beach."
"115740052-0-10785";"My King! The Stormfist cheated! These Nords have been poisoned!"
"115740052-0-10786";"Your brother Fildgor sends his greetings, false king. He wants you to know that he has returned from exile to claim what is his by birth and by right. Your rule is over, pretender! Prepare to die!"
"115740052-0-10787";"Poison? Fildgor? What is the meaning of this? Guards! Seize that woman!"
"115740052-0-10788";"For Fildgor! For the rightful king of Skyrim! Show no mercy!"
"115740052-0-10789";"Please! Is there anything you can tell me? My son left five days ago and I haven't heard from him since."
"115740052-0-10790";"That was a nasty beast!"
"115740052-0-10791";"This way, squad!"
"115740052-0-10792";"On your feet, you louts! We're going back in."
"115740052-0-10793";"Burn them all!"
"115740052-0-10795";"Serjo? I don't like the look of the ash clouds to the west."
"115740052-0-10796";"Cloudgazing, soldier? Shouldn't you be catching pickpockets?"
"115740052-0-10797";"The mountain's stirring. You can feel it in your belly."
"115740052-0-10798";"The only thing stirring my belly is a need for Falkreath venison."
"115740052-0-10799";"The ash clouds to the west are breaking up."
"115740052-0-10800";"You're still going on about that volcano?"
"115740052-0-10801";"The Indorils say it's cursed. An abode of Daedra."
"115740052-0-10802";"If the Indorils were infallible, they wouldn't have needed the Hero of Bal Foyen."
"115740052-0-10803";"About time the drink arrived."
"115740052-0-10804";"This drink seems to have gone right to my head. I may have to lay down."
"115740052-0-10805";"You there. Any orders from Indoril or the One-Eye?"
"115740052-0-10806";"No. There's rumor they seek an ancient weapon."
"115740052-0-10807";"Ancient weap—\n\nWe need to murder the Covenant, not dig holes!"
"115740052-0-10808";"It's only what I heard, serjo."
"115740052-0-10809";"Soldier! Any news from the expedition?"
"115740052-0-10810";"Few made it back. They were badly burned."
"115740052-0-10812";"Burned! Was it some kind of fire weapon?"
"115740052-0-10813";"They say it walked like a man. They'd be dead if not for the Hero of Bal Foyen."
"115740052-0-10814";"I'll watch your back. Finish the General off!"
"115740052-0-10815";"I'll meet you back at camp!"
"115740052-0-10818";"Stay away from me, you monster!"
"115740052-0-10819";"Damn it, woman! You need to come with me now! The sun hurts me more than you know. We need to get inside!"
"115740052-0-10820";"Come down here and look around. The cup belongs on one of these altars, but I do not know which one."
"115740052-0-10821";"That appears to be the correct altar. Very good. I will see you in the next chamber."
"115740052-0-10822";"That was the wrong altar. You have awakened the dead."
"115740052-0-10832";"Time to go, Scales. We need to make sure you don't turn into one of these creatures."
"115740052-0-10833";"What are you doing? No! Don't let him take me!"
"115740052-0-10834";"The book you carry belongs on this pedestal. However, a page was torn out when it was plundered."
"115740052-0-10835";"Excellent. Who knew you could read ancient Nord? One chamber remains. Mine. Bring my amulet and meet me there."
"115740052-0-10836";"That is not the right page. Try again, mortal."
"115740052-0-10842";"I need some fortification if I'm going to attend the council. I'll head over after I drink this bottle."
"115740052-0-10843";"I told you to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-10844";"Move along!"
"115740052-0-10845";"You want me to run you in?"
"115740052-0-10846";"All right, all right!"
"115740052-0-10847";"Mercy, friend."
"115740052-0-10848";"Would I get fed?"
"115740052-0-10849";"We've been at Dock for too long, and I don't like it. I feel like we're being set up."
"115740052-0-10850";"Well, I'm dying for action, this sitting around doesn't suit me too well. So if someone wants to try anything, then I'll make sure to do them the way the Blacksails did in the old days. You know, make a spectical of it all."
"115740052-0-10851";"Well, keep your pants on. Kyle doesn't like it when things get too wild. I've got to get back, but spread the word, if I catch anyone messing around my quarters, then I'm going to thump them, hard."
"115740052-0-10852";"I can't wait to get back to the surface, I hate it down here."
"115740052-0-10853";"You're not kidding. I don't know what <<1>> is thinking, but he's been acting crazy lately, and how he has us hole up in this dank, dark place. I don't like it."
"115740052-0-10854";"You know with all the Blacksails leaders getting murdered by every crazy way, even by their own poison. I guess I don't blame <<1>> for being nervous, but can't hide forever. I'd rather go out with a bloodied blade than wetting my blankets."
"115740052-0-10855";"What's your opinion of the Fighters Guild, soldier?"
"115740052-0-10856";"I've never had a problem with them."
"115740052-0-10857";"You don't regard them as upstart amateurs?"
"115740052-0-10858";"The guild is apolitical, not unprofessional."
"115740052-0-10859";"I'd love to get that sword at Riidras Avani's store."
"115740052-0-10860";"What's stopping you?"
"115740052-0-10861";"Can't afford it. Maybe someday."
"115740052-0-10862";"Being lowborn must be awful. I couldn't stand it."
"115740052-0-10863";"You ever fought the Daggers?"
"115740052-0-10864";"A few times. And the Dominion, when I served in Shadowfen."
"115740052-0-10865";"Is it true their soldiers drink the blood of infants?"
"115740052-0-10866";"Uh, no. Most of the Covenant soldiers we met drank beer."
"115740052-0-10867";"Think we'll ever have peace in Cyrodiil?"
"115740052-0-10868";"I hope not. Strife keeps our culture strong."
"115740052-0-10869";"Huh. Ever served on the front lines?"
"115740052-0-10870";"By the Three, no. That's for lowborn like you. No offense."
"115740052-0-10871";"Look for survivors!"
"115740052-0-10872";"Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-10873";"The whispers grow louder! We must hurry."
"115740052-0-10874";"My head's pounding. Hard to think."
"115740052-0-10875";"Who wanders into my web? More playthings?"
"115740052-0-10876";"Come to me, my pets."
"115740052-0-10877";"I can taste your delicious fear."
"115740052-0-10878";"Closer, my prey. Closer."
"115740052-0-10879";"Kill them all! No mercy!"
"115740052-0-10880";"The Orcthane plans to use them at the dragonshrine to usurp my father's throne."
"115740052-0-10881";"Fildgor's at Skuldafn with the Crown of Freydis and the body of Queen Nurnhilde. For what purpose?"
"115740052-0-10882";"A necromantic ritual, perhaps?"
"115740052-0-10883";"The Crown is a powerful artifact. I shudder to think what the Orcthane can accomplish with it."
"115740052-0-10884";"I don't like the idea of that bastard using our fabled crown. And I hate that he has our beloved queen's body."
"115740052-0-10885";"Father! You honor us! I'm glad to see you up and around."
"115740052-0-10887";"My brother seeks to pull my sister's soul from Sovngarde. The Crown of Freydis will see the soul, not the man."
"115740052-0-10888";"It's good to see you well, Jorunn. We've been discussing how to approach Skuldafn."
"115740052-0-10889";"Yes, yes. We discuss and we strategize while Fildgor digs in and strengthens his defenses."
"115740052-0-10890";"So, have we come to any conclusions?"
"115740052-0-10891";"The Stormfists have fortified the primary path to the dragonshrine. A frontal assault would take time that we may not have."
"115740052-0-10892";"Time is a luxury we don't possess. If Fildgor completes this ritual, all is lost."
"115740052-0-10893";"That's why you wanted to see those scouting reports! You think there's another way into Skuldafn."
"115740052-0-10894";"There is always another way. Champion, may we speak?"
"115740052-0-10895";"Anything interesting happen to you lately?"
"115740052-0-10896";"Saw a mudcrab the other day."
"115740052-0-10897";"Ugh, so what? Those things are everywhere. Like rats."
"115740052-0-10898";"This one was three paces wide and eating a guar."
"115740052-0-10899";"What do you know about the Dark Elf Ashlanders?"
"115740052-0-10900";"Not much. They keep to themselves. I think they worship Daedra."
"115740052-0-10901";"I heard they don't live in towns because the Dark Elf houses hate them."
"115740052-0-10902";"Just between us, I heard Ashlanders accuse the Tribunal gods of murder."
"115740052-0-10903";"Avani's a great blacksmith. His daggers are sharp enough to cut the air."
"115740052-0-10904";"He certainly has female admirers. I wonder why he never remarried."
"115740052-0-10905";"He still mourns his wife. Have you seen him in the evenings?"
"115740052-0-10906";"He takes flowers to the Akaviri War Memorial. He talks to her stone."
"115740052-0-10907";"When I was younger, I wanted to be a mage."
"115740052-0-10908";"They say anyone can cast, but few have real talent."
"115740052-0-10909";"I wasn't talented. After three months of training, I could barely light a candle."
"115740052-0-10910";"You wouldn't have liked it. The Mages Guild is all dust and rules."
"115740052-0-10911";"Why's everyone fighting over Cyrodiil? What's it worth?"
"115740052-0-10912";"Didn't you know? The emperor's dead. They're fighting over the throne."
"115740052-0-10913";"So what? The only good thing the Empire ever gave us was flin whiskey."
"115740052-0-10914";"The emperor did keep the peace. We weren't raided by High Rock or Summerset."
"115740052-0-10915";"The Tribunal priests say a saint named Veloth led the Dark Elves here."
"115740052-0-10916";"Here? To this wasteland of ash and fungus? Did he hate them?"
"115740052-0-10917";"This is their promised land. That's why they fight so hard to keep it."
"115740052-0-10918";"Seems less like a promise and more like a threat."
"115740052-0-10919";"Hurry up, Gaston! What in blazes are you doing in there?"
"115740052-0-10920";"Your gold. Now. Unless you want to bleed."
"115740052-0-10921";"Our job is done. It was a pleasure working with you!"
"115740052-0-10922";"Awakened at long last! Crow's Wood shall be mine!"
"115740052-0-10923";"Why won't you die?"
"115740052-0-10924";"My strength returns. Let the Pact see that I am on the road to recovery."
"115740052-0-10925";"Farewell, friend. I'll be sure the ritual goes properly next time."
"115740052-0-10926";"You won't stop the Orcthane!"
"115740052-0-10927";"Misery and death all around. This pleases me!"
"115740052-0-10928";"Come to me. Enter my web. Join me, forever."
"115740052-0-10929";"Closer. Come closer. Embrace the darkness."
"115740052-0-10930";"Can't … resist. Must … obey."
"115740052-0-10931";"Incorruptible creatures! You dare to defy me! I'll kill you all!"
"115740052-0-10934";"You wish to hear the story of the Silvenar and the Green Lady? I will do one better."
"115740052-0-10935";"Come forward and witness my creation!"
"115740052-0-10936";"The Hound calls the Green Lady, and she will answer. The Silvenar will be no more!"
"115740052-0-10939";"Come to me my minions!"
"115740052-0-10942";"You've done it! But … something draws me away!"
"115740052-0-10945";"What happened here? There are dead and injured people all over the place! And who are you?"
"115740052-0-10946";"What insolence! You have no right to be here!"
"115740052-0-10947";"Thanks for the help! Come on, let's rally at the Watchtower!"
"115740052-0-10948";"We barely made it, thanks for the help, I'm going to head back to help secure the Tower!"
"115740052-0-10949";"Brothers and sisters! The newcomer has made an offering to the Bad Man! Join with me in celebration!"
"115740052-0-10950";"They come. Like stands against like. Choose wisely!"
"115740052-0-10951";"Bad Man, stern hand of the harvest, master of blight and plenty, accept this gift! Feed, and grow stronger."
"115740052-0-10952";"My head is pounding. I wonder if we'll ever see the commander again?"
"115740052-0-10953";"We'll get through this. Don't let the whispers get inside your head. Fill it with pleasant thoughts."
"115740052-0-10955";"So, you must be the one causing so much trouble for my troops. Well, that ends here. To me, my honor guard!"
"115740052-0-10956";"You don't look like you'll last very long in here. Bormolg, Dumolg! Rip the intruder apart!"
"115740052-0-10957";"You think you're really something, don't you? Let's see you defeat three elite Orcs!"
"115740052-0-10958";"No … I must not fall! Please do not fail me, friend."
"115740052-0-10959";"Son of a troll! If you want something done right, you just have to do it yourself."
"115740052-0-10960";"Majorn, my master, would like to speak with you."
"115740052-0-10962";"Quick, get to the Captain! She's holed up in a cave near the hill."
"115740052-0-10963";"Listen, cousin. Skorvild's as crazy as an outhouse skeever."
"115740052-0-10964";"Quiet! Do you want Eiraki to hear you?"
"115740052-0-10965";"Look around, cousin. What difference does it make now?"
"115740052-0-10967";"May his hunger never be sated. May his roots grow ever deeper!"
"115740052-0-10970";"I said I'd help you, right? My friend'll watch your back."
"115740052-0-10972";"Fool! I serve the Worm Cult now!"
"115740052-0-10973";"Keep going!"
"115740052-0-10974";"I thought I'd never get out of this place. Thank you."
"115740052-0-10975";"I'm … free! We must leave, quickly!"
"115740052-0-10976";"You dare to oppose me?"
"115740052-0-10977";"The river brings danger to Boulderfall."
"115740052-0-10978";"Who trespasses here? Show yourself!"
"115740052-0-10979";"Please, keep to your feet. We are needed."
"115740052-0-10980";"<<1>> here will get you up to speed. Until we meet again."
"115740052-0-10982";"Valeric won't hold me back any longer. I'll become stronger than the ancients and destroy them all!"
"115740052-0-10983";"What have you …."
"115740052-0-10985";"You've done it! We're safe!\n\nCome, find me! I wish to speak to you once again."
"115740052-0-10986";"The Green Lady is mine!"
"115740052-0-10987";"You think to stop me, mortal? Then, let us begin the game!"
"115740052-0-10989";"Find your way to Boulderfall. Speak to Centurion Gjakil."
"115740052-0-10991";"What do you think you're doing?"
"115740052-0-10994";"You dare violate the ancient grounds!"
"115740052-0-10996";"Look, I know Sheor and the Bad Man are very similar."
"115740052-0-10997";"Of course they're similar. They're the same deity!"
"115740052-0-10998";"I disagree. The Bad Man has always been the Breton god of famine. Sheor wasn't associated with the harvest crop until centuries later."
"115740052-0-10999";"Nonsense. Historically, the two are one in the same."
"115740052-0-11000";"You're mistaken. Sheor is a trickster. The Bad Man is specifically associated with crop failure. Appeasing him assures a healthy crop. They couldn't be more different."
"115740052-0-11001";"That doesn't make sense. If he can be appeased, why do they call him ""the Bad Man""?"
"115740052-0-11004";"You're too late! <<1>> was weak! Unworthy in the eyes of Mauloch!"
"115740052-0-11005";"<<1>>'s blood is on your hands, whelp!"
"115740052-0-11006";"We will hold a massacre in Mauloch's honor!"
"115740052-0-11007";"Rise! Defeat my foes!"
"115740052-0-11008";"Why does my father still sleep, priest?"
"115740052-0-11009";"Our healing magic maintains his life, but the Daedric poison is strong. I'm not sure we can overcome it."
"115740052-0-11010";"If my father dies, the Ternion monks will suffer. Understand that, healer. Now save your King."
"115740052-0-11011";"Why can't I find it?"
"115740052-0-11012";"The Dragon must be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-11013";"I will find it!"
"115740052-0-11015";"Come, Dreamwalker. King Jorunn is ready. It is time for you to get involved."
"115740052-0-11016";"Not to worry. I've done this many times, many times. Never entered a king's dreams, though. Or battled Daedric magic. Hmm. But I'm sure everything will be just fine."
"115740052-0-11017";"Be sure to hold the King down. If he begins to thrash around, hit him with a rock. Kidding, kidding!"
"115740052-0-11018";"Very cold. Must be as quick as possible. Find the fires. Their warmth will keep you alive. Walls … coming down. Stay near the light. Must remember, stay near the light."
"115740052-0-11019";"Very sad. The King's soldiers. They fell in battle but are raised in a dream. Rage fills them. And they are strong. Wish I had the strength to fight them. This is going to be a challenge to say the least."
"115740052-0-11020";"What is this madness? Visions of warriors lost. A woman. Beckoning to me. Strange. Beautiful. But something is wrong here. I need to be very careful. Wish there was a way to figure out the truth."
"115740052-0-11021";"Arrrggghhh!"
"115740052-0-11022";"To me my hungry little ones!"
"115740052-0-11023";"You dare speak of peace? Bleed and die, whelp!"
"115740052-0-11024";"We've taken back what was once ours! You are too late, outsider!"
"115740052-0-11025";"You fight to defend corpses, fool!"
"115740052-0-11026";"Hey—this is our treasure! Stop right now!"
"115740052-0-11028";"You bring ruin to the valley and my people!"
"115740052-0-11029";"Mauloch! I give my blood!"
"115740052-0-11030";"Thank the gods! Please, you have to let me out of here."
"115740052-0-11031";"We have what we came for. The dirt's all yours, friend!"
"115740052-0-11032";"Stop right there, stranger. This is our claim."
"115740052-0-11033";"No! Hot, hot, hot! I'm burning up in here!"
"115740052-0-11035";"The ritual is almost complete! Soon the draugr will obey my every command!"
"115740052-0-11036";"You can't stop me. Let Eastmarch tremble before my army of undead!"
"115740052-0-11037";"You need to leave! Whatever's happening to me, it isn't safe. Now go!"
"115740052-0-11038";"We've got to hide! That lodge there. Let's get inside!"
"115740052-0-11039";"Excellent! Now that we have the book, perhaps we have a chance!"
"115740052-0-11040";"Rise Sinmur! Return, and taste the blood of Ysgramor's heirs!"
"115740052-0-11042";"You! You've been a thorn in my side for too long. Come then, interloper. Come and die!"
"115740052-0-11046";"Ah! I didn't think it would be like this! The pain!"
"115740052-0-11047";"The dead rise within the caverns! They smell worse than you do."
"115740052-0-11048";"The cultists are almost there. Move faster!"
"115740052-0-11049";"The cultists have breached my tomb. There's no time left!"
"115740052-0-11050";"No … my sister is gone. And I will honor her memory by living my life."
"115740052-0-11051";"Your sister cared for you deeply. Why fight this dream? Why not give in? You can be with her once more."
"115740052-0-11052";"You can't stop me. I will not give in so easily. I will live on because of my sister."
"115740052-0-11053";"I'm going to check on the others!"
"115740052-0-11054";"Thank you, stranger. To Sovngarde I go!"
"115740052-0-11055";"Hurry! One of the Worm Cultists took an animus geode into that cave!"
"115740052-0-11056";"<<1>>? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-11057";"Tell my family … I love them."
"115740052-0-11058";"Grandfather! You're dead?"
"115740052-0-11059";"I'll miss you."
"115740052-0-11060";"You were always the bravest lass."
"115740052-0-11061";"Tell your grandmother … tell her I'll wait for her at Ysgramor's side."
"115740052-0-11062";"Father! I was so worried."
"115740052-0-11063";"Quickly, before more come! Follow me downstairs!"
"115740052-0-11064";"Where've you gone, bastard of Sep? You can't hide forever!"
"115740052-0-11065";"Thanks for the help. See you outside!"
"115740052-0-11066";"No! It can't end like this. I can't be defeated! Not again!"
"115740052-0-11067";"We need to get the chieftain's attention.\n\nThat drum! In the treasure pile."
"115740052-0-11068";"We cannot leave the fortress. If we go any further I will need to return to the barracks."
"115740052-0-11069";"I'm heading back to the barracks. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-11070";"I'll go help the others!"
"115740052-0-11071";"Thank you, mortal, for releasing my children! Once Orulu and Neechar leave the shrines, they'll carve a swath of destruction in your name!"
"115740052-0-11072";"I will not be denied! Spirits of Sovngarde, answer the call of the rightful King of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-11073";"Ha! As long as the Circle of Iron exists, my children will destroy Nirn!"
"115740052-0-11075";"Look out for that furry beast!"
"115740052-0-11076";"Here he comes! To Sovngarde with him!"
"115740052-0-11077";"You've done it! Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-11078";"The circle may rust, or it could roll out to sea. No matter! I'll destroy you!"
"115740052-0-11079";"Can you believe Jorunn defeated his brother? Fildgor must have been drunk or something."
"115740052-0-11080";"If that fool Jorunn thinks we're going to die for him, he's dumber than I thought. I'd sooner stab him in the back than stand at his side."
"115740052-0-11081";"I am made of fire, smoke, and terror! I'll find a new vessel and come after you!"
"115740052-0-11082";"It's coming!"
"115740052-0-11083";"Help me!"
"115740052-0-11084";"Spirits of Sovngarde, protect me!"
"115740052-0-11085";"I died for this? For Jorunn? I bet he never lifted a sword in his life! But his sister, Nurnhilde. She was a true warrior!"
"115740052-0-11086";"By Kyne, Fildgor could fight, too. Now that's a man I'd die for! But no. We get a bard king. He won't survive a year, I'd wager."
"115740052-0-11087";"We'd be better off. Making an alliance with the Dark Elves? Jorunn's a traitor, if you ask me. A damned puppet king!"
"115740052-0-11088";"This one wishes Beralagr's paw had not been broken. The bear, she can not dance well now."
"115740052-0-11089";"I sense an intruder! Stormfists! To my side!"
"115740052-0-11090";"At least she can scare merchants into giving us food."
"115740052-0-11091";"Too little, too late, you fool. Neither you nor your supposed Skald-King can stop us."
"115740052-0-11092";"This is true. We eat better now than when she danced."
"115740052-0-11093";"Thank you!"
"115740052-0-11094";"As you wish. Meet me at Fallowstone Hall as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-11095";"On to Fallowstone Hall!"
"115740052-0-11096";"Come now! We've no time to waste."
"115740052-0-11097";"Shor keep them. These warriors never stood a chance."
"115740052-0-11098";"Move! I can't let them down."
"115740052-0-11099";"I cannot wait. If you have the courage, find me at Fallowstone Hall!"
"115740052-0-11101";"Give in to your dreams. Submit to the darkness!"
"115740052-0-11102";"Never! I will wake from this dream. I will find my brother and any others who put our people at risk. They will all fall to my blade! This I swear!"
"115740052-0-11103";"You underestimate me and my allies, foul creature!"
"115740052-0-11104";"I remember when my sister sat upon her throne. My brother and I would tease her endlessly about being the queen."
"115740052-0-11105";"Sister! This can't be. This must be part of my dream."
"115740052-0-11106";"Jorunn, my beloved brother. It's been so long. I wish the news I bring you wasn't so dire."
"115740052-0-11107";"What is it, Nurnhilde? What's wrong?"
"115740052-0-11108";"It's Fildgor. I know why our brother stole my body and the crown. He plans to call forth my spirit and merge it with his own. He believes that by possessing me, he shall become the rightful king."
"115740052-0-11109";"Please, friend, leave us so that we can talk. I'll join you in the waking world shortly."
"115740052-0-11110";"Interesting. Very interesting. I remember reading something … a reference to Ayleid wells …."
"115740052-0-11111";"Let's see. A little of this. Perhaps some tincture of lich blood.\n\nThere!  Since you brought the ore, you can test it!"
"115740052-0-11112";"The others … are they free of the Worm Cult's grasp?"
"115740052-0-11113";"Thank you. Now I can go to my rest with a glad heart."
"115740052-0-11119";"They killed my husband!"
"115740052-0-11120";"They stole our souls!"
"115740052-0-11121";"We're not done yet!"
"115740052-0-11122";"I can open a portal for you. But after all this, I only have the energy to teleport you and your son."
"115740052-0-11123";"That's fine. Our friend here has done more than enough for us already and deserves some time to rest. Come Irnskar, let's go."
"115740052-0-11124";"You are welcome to join us at our camp if you wish. Whatever you decide, thank you for what you have done."
"115740052-0-11125";"Well done! Now, be swift. I must keep these dark energies under control until you free the other Keepers."
"115740052-0-11126";"<The giant grunts irritably and looks like it wants you to turn around.>"
"115740052-0-11127";"<The giant growls angrily and turns back toward Cradlecrush.>"
"115740052-0-11128";"You dare? Come, then. I'll feast upon your sweet, sweet blood!"
"115740052-0-11134";"I told you to be careful!"
"115740052-0-11136";"Esteemed allies. I stand before my ancestors, at this holy dragonshrine, to seal our pact for the greater good."
"115740052-0-11137";"I stand on this mountain to proclaim how far the Argonians have come from the swamps of Black Marsh. In the name of my people, I add my voice to form this Ebonheart Pact."
"115740052-0-11138";"You attack us? You're nothing but a puppet, dancing at the end of my evil father's strings!"
"115740052-0-11139";"I represent the Dunmer and the Tribunal. I stand on this frigid rock to affirm our place in the Ebonheart Pact. I fervently hope we can move this along, because it's freezing up here."
"115740052-0-11141";"The Nords offer the Crown of Freydis. This symbol of power and wisdom provides the Pact with the strength and authority of our Nord ancestors."
"115740052-0-11143";"The Dunmer offer the Judgment of Veloth, an artifact of ancient magic. This provides the Pact with our skills and the blessing of the Tribunal."
"115740052-0-11144";"The Argonians offer the Mnemic Egg, sacred symbol of birth and life, thus granting our wisdom and the memories of the Hist to the Pact. With these offerings, the Pact is sealed. Let our nations become one."
"115740052-0-11145";"Further, the Dunmer call for a single leader to hold this Pact together. We believe Skald-King Jorunn is the one to lead us!"
"115740052-0-11146";"Let our enemies tremble at our combined might! I accept the role of High King of the Ebonheart Pact. We have much to discuss here. Please, Champion, return to Jorunn's Stand and tell my son what has transpired here."
"115740052-0-11149";"Let me just add a pinch of purified frost salt and see what happens."
"115740052-0-11150";"Big man said you'd be showing up soon. He's upstairs with the lizard girl."
"115740052-0-11152";"Get moving, lads. I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-11153";"Yes sir!"
"115740052-0-11154";"Let's go, brother!"
"115740052-0-11156";"Brother. Why did it come to this?"
"115740052-0-11157";"I was wrong, brother. Please, spare me. I am capable of helping you!"
"115740052-0-11158";"No, brother. I know all too well what you are capable of. The King's judgment stands."
"115740052-0-11159";"May the spirits forgive you, Fildgor, for I have not."
"115740052-0-11171";"I  will do more research and talk to Jomund. An interesting find indeed.."
"115740052-0-11172";"You found the messenger! Was she carrying Osanne's letter?"
"115740052-0-11173";"Ela! You said I could do the torchin'!"
"115740052-0-11174";"Then go, by Jode! I'm not stopping you."
"115740052-0-11190";"Quickly, over here! I haven't much time!"
"115740052-0-11191";"I'll make sure this letter is destroyed."
"115740052-0-11194";"Look, my husband's bow! He's been here. We must get past that door!"
"115740052-0-11196";"Why do you hate us, Nord? Your own King declared us allies, but still you turn us away."
"115740052-0-11197";"Don't put words in my mouth, Dark Elf. I said you could enter Fort Amol. But the inn is full, so you can't stay. Official business of the kingdom takes precedence, after all."
"115740052-0-11198";"This is ridiculous! And we've come such a long way. We'll find somewhere else to rest. Somewhere not filled with such … such hate!"
"115740052-0-11200";"I can feel the chill touch of Coldharbour draining away. Well done."
"115740052-0-11201";"Their focus wanes. Keep going."
"115740052-0-11202";"Another portal closed."
"115740052-0-11203";"We've found Thallik Wormfather! Come to the portal in the central ruins!"
"115740052-0-11204";"Ready to burn? Then come into the fire!"
"115740052-0-11206";"We need to figure out what happened here."
"115740052-0-11207";"The Hound sends fresh meat to my lair!"
"115740052-0-11208";"Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-11209";"What is it? Why are you following me?"
"115740052-0-11210";"I feel you approaching—but you're too late."
"115740052-0-11211";"Took you long enough, Commander."
"115740052-0-11212";"I thought I was being followed. We have to be smart about all this."
"115740052-0-11213";"Don't insult my intelligence. I know we only get one chance at this. Besides, word from the inside is that things are going well."
"115740052-0-11215";"Good, good. I took care of things on my end. I stuffed all of the duplicates in Marla's house. As long as no one goes snooping around in there, we'll be fine."
"115740052-0-11216";"The Green Hunters attack! Let them taste steel!"
"115740052-0-11217";"Wolf-brothers! Rend that soft flesh!"
"115740052-0-11218";"You're too late! You'll never stop Fildgor's plans."
"115740052-0-11219";"Help me, hunters! I need you!"
"115740052-0-11220";"We've had the dead searching for the shards of Wuuthrad. And we found one."
"115740052-0-11221";"Prove your value to us, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-11222";"I'm going to scout around a bit, make sure the creatures have retreated."
"115740052-0-11223";"Quickly. Open the portal!"
"115740052-0-11224";"The Nord don't need the help of the weakling Argonians and the cowardly Dark Elves. We can win this war on our own!"
"115740052-0-11225";"Your uncle Fildgor has allied himself with the Stormfist clan and the Orcs, my Prince. We need all the help we can get. You need to apologize to the delegates and get them back to the table before this rift grows any wider."
"115740052-0-11226";"Let the Pact shatter and fall for all I care! We need no one but ourselves! You grow old and weak, Harvald, like my father. This conversation is over."
"115740052-0-11227";"Thallik Wormfather retreated through the portal to Arcwind Point! Go quickly! Captain Hrosta is there already."
"115740052-0-11228";"I am ready to receive ambassadors in style! Ladies can't resist cultural garb! Get dressed and meet me by the docks."
"115740052-0-11229";"I'm here, Gwaering! No one can stop our union now!"
"115740052-0-11230";"Green Lady! Remember the Green Pact! Come to me!"
"115740052-0-11231";"How dare you threaten us?"
"115740052-0-11232";"No! We belong together!"
"115740052-0-11233";"The Orcthane's soldiers! There are too many of them! Someone, help!"
"115740052-0-11234";"Welcome to bustling city of Windhelm for King Jorunn's amazing Corn-un-licker celebration. We greet the ambassadors of the glorious Dark Elf and Argonian nations with stinky arms and open fish."
"115740052-0-11235";"Let Rigurt be the first to welcome … one moment please. Let me just check my notes … Ambassador Flies-of-Steel and Ambassador Normal! Ha!"
"115740052-0-11236";"How amusing. King Jorunn sent his court jester to receive us. Bravo! Bravo I say!"
"115740052-0-11237";"What an … interesting form of greeting. I may never truly learn to understand the dryskins. Perhaps we should head to the inn, Yeveth?"
"115740052-0-11238";"Yes. Cracking suggestion. Perhaps they'll have something other than … what's that awful Nord beverage … ah, yes. Mead."
"115740052-0-11242";"Wuuthrad is not for you, little one."
"115740052-0-11243";"I'm afraid this has made Sinmur even more dangerous. Quickly, we must speak!"
"115740052-0-11244";"Well done! Take the portal back to the Ebonheart Pact camp."
"115740052-0-11245";"You! You will not stop Valcent!"
"115740052-0-11246";"The Worm Cult will prevail!"
"115740052-0-11247";"What are you doing in here? Get out!"
"115740052-0-11248";"By the blood we consume, by the hills and vales we protect, let the spirit of the Silvenar and the body of the Green Lady become as one.\n\nBefore Y'ffre and those gathered, for this generation, and those who came before and go after … be joined!"
"115740052-0-11249";"Not another cat! I hate cats! They make me itch."
"115740052-0-11250";"Thank you for setting me free. I'll never forget this."
"115740052-0-11251";"What in Kyne's name was that?"
"115740052-0-11252";"You just have to poke your nose into things that don't concern you, don't you? You can join the rest of the bodies in here!"
"115740052-0-11254";"Ysgramor protects me still. I'll see you there."
"115740052-0-11255";"Kyne, what they did to Tirora. I have to stay strong. I'll see you back at the Hall."
"115740052-0-11256";"Aye, thank you! Onward, for glory!"
"115740052-0-11257";"I give my spirit to <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-11265";"I can't leave the Crypts until I find my husband!"
"115740052-0-11266";"We have them on the run! Frostfang, their chieftain, is trapped in the basement. It's through the trapdoor. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-11267";"Rawrrrr!"
"115740052-0-11268";"Your suspicions have merit, my Thane."
"115740052-0-11269";"Surely no harm could be done to Ysgramor's axe."
"115740052-0-11270";"I beg your leave to speak to this stranger myself."
"115740052-0-11271";"State your case, stranger."
"115740052-0-11272";"Meet me outside."
"115740052-0-11273";"Forgive my grandfather's behavior. He's not himself."
"115740052-0-11274";"That's strange. Where are the guards?"
"115740052-0-11278";"Move or call out and you lose your tongue. Simple, right?"
"115740052-0-11282";"Is that you, Cirion? I don't know how you defeated those banekin but I'll be glad to send more."
"115740052-0-11283";"Are you an idiot? We're surrounded by the enemy!"
"115740052-0-11284";"Ah. It's the outsiders. So the Keepers are afraid to face me. Very well. You'll die in their stead."
"115740052-0-11285";"The big bad Stormfists are outside? Maybe we should go upstairs so I can protect you, all proper like."
"115740052-0-11286";"I'm going to enjoy this!"
"115740052-0-11287";"People really frustrate me sometimes."
"115740052-0-11288";"We must get into the Vault. I hope I'm wrong about why the Reachmen are here."
"115740052-0-11293";"So you've finally come to the aid of the King."
"115740052-0-11295";"Get away from there!"
"115740052-0-11296";"Dhalen said you were coming after us. Let's see how you handle two of the best warriors of the Stormfist Brigade!"
"115740052-0-11297";"Well done. Too little, too late, though. The false king is dead. Once you join him, Fildgor will rule this land."
"115740052-0-11298";"Is that it, master, is that what we came here for?"
"115740052-0-11299";"Yes, Wuuthrad is now ours. If the others have done their part, the Nords are doomed!"
"115740052-0-11300";"The portal awaits, master."
"115740052-0-11301";"Good. But you're not done yet."
"115740052-0-11302";"Whew, that was a close one."
"115740052-0-11307";"Tervur Sadri!"
"115740052-0-11308";"Time to go!"
"115740052-0-11317";"While I keep you busy here, the thane gets a final recruitment offer. If she refuses, she dies."
"115740052-0-11320";"What would you do to save a loved one?"
"115740052-0-11321";"What about my daughter? The Worm Cult has promised to bring her back and you're in the way!"
"115740052-0-11322";"Do you remember my husband? My son? The Worm Cult will bring them back and you're in the way."
"115740052-0-11323";"Vaermina's will be done!"
"115740052-0-11324";"Your legend ends now, hero of Bal Foyen."
"115740052-0-11325";"You've grown into a beauty, my child."
"115740052-0-11326";"But I see you have another visitor."
"115740052-0-11328";"The undead! They march on Fullhelm!"
"115740052-0-11329";"My lord. We're holding the stairs, barely."
"115740052-0-11330";"Anyone in here who can fight, get yourself outside."
"115740052-0-11331";"I take orders from the Sea Vipers now!"
"115740052-0-11333";"Might be the booze, but that doesn't sound right. Start over."
"115740052-0-11334";"All these handsome soldiers! Maybe the alchemist can brew something that will attract them to me."
"115740052-0-11335";"Really? You're that desperate for attention?"
"115740052-0-11336";"Your problem is, you wouldn't know a good opportunity if it bit you on the nose."
"115740052-0-11337";"What do you think the Skald-King will do about his brother, Fildgor?"
"115740052-0-11338";"I don't know, but I hope he decides something soon. All these outsiders milling about make me nervous."
"115740052-0-11339";"The lizards aren't so bad. Just a bit odd. But the Dark Elves are an arrogant bunch, the lot of them."
"115740052-0-11341";"I admit it. I'm still a little uneasy about the Argonians joining the alliance and all."
"115740052-0-11342";"The keep! The keep's on fire!"
"115740052-0-11343";"The keep! The keep's on fire!"
"115740052-0-11344";"It doesn't sit right with everyone, true. But I can't fault their bravery or skill in battle."
"115740052-0-11345";"There is that. And they have a remarkable tendency to find warm spots where they can sun themselves."
"115740052-0-11346";"Help! Someone! It's grandfather!"
"115740052-0-11350";"I'll see you at Fallowstone Hall!"
"115740052-0-11351";"I have string in one pocket, rocks in another, and a dead toad in my shoe."
"115740052-0-11352";"You were kicked in the head as a sap egg, weren't you?"
"115740052-0-11353";"Well, isn't that nice? Do you have any sandwiches?"
"115740052-0-11354";"Quickly, follow me. This place is crawling with Reachmen!"
"115740052-0-11355";"Hurry, before they spot us!"
"115740052-0-11356";"I can't see anything from here. I need to get inside their camp."
"115740052-0-11358";"We need to move; people are dying in there!"
"115740052-0-11359";"Time to get myself captured. Do your part!"
"115740052-0-11364";"I have a little joke I'd like to tell. It had Mary down at the Quartermasters rolling on the floor with laughter. Clearly it was a good one. Would you like to hear it?"
"115740052-0-11365";"Please, try to never talk to me, I hate you, everyone hates you. You're very annoying. Go away."
"115740052-0-11366";"So you see, there were these two peanuts, they were walking through the park, enjoying the day. I know it's silly that peanuts are walking or enjoying anything, but that's the key to the joke. And you know what happened? One was assaulted. Get it?"
"115740052-0-11367";"Hmmm…<<1>> seems rather down…I wonder what I could to for him…her…well, whatever, I wonder what I can do to cheer <<1>> up?"
"115740052-0-11368";"I know! I'll throw <<1>> a birthday party! I'm sure she…he…or whatever, will love it! Everyone loves birthday parties! Now, I wonder if those kind of people even have birthdays? Well, no matter, a party it is!"
"115740052-0-11369";"The ones who once served you now serve me, Jorunn!"
"115740052-0-11370";"They've got Kireth too! She's in the tent behind the Dragon mound."

"115740052-0-11379";"Mead, mead, mead!\nI drink it morning, noon, and eve.\nI like it spiced and sweet and powerful!\nI'll soon be rung, and that's quite laudable!"
"115740052-0-11381";"Mead, mead, mead!\nI drink it morning, noon, and eve.\nI like it spiced and sweet and powerful!\nI'll soon be drunk and that's quite probable!"
"115740052-0-11382";"Mead, mead, mead!\nI drink it morning, noon, and eve.\nI like it spiced and sweet and powerful!\nI'll soon be drunk, and that's quite probable!"
"115740052-0-11385";"Wait, that's not how it goes! It's ""probable,"" not ""laudable."""
"115740052-0-11386";"What? That doesn't even make sense! What's probable? That I'm going to get drunk? That's a given fact!"
"115740052-0-11387";"Now I'm confused. I think I need more mead."
"115740052-0-11388";"I don't like this song anymore. Let's sing something else."
"115740052-0-11389";"But getting drunk isn't laudable. You should be able to hold your mead a lot better than that."
"115740052-0-11390";"Shut up, Bellin. Now my head hurts."

"115740052-0-11395";"You ruined everything!"
"115740052-0-11396";"I would have ruled forever, with her at my side!"
"115740052-0-11397";"I waited years to have her!"
"115740052-0-11401";"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"115740052-0-11402";"What in Oblivion are you doing?!"
"115740052-0-11403";"I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-11404";"The Nords are so loud. And they have so many strange customs. But it's so very exciting!"
"115740052-0-11405";"Look! Over there! Those strange creatures. Is that part of the celebration?"
"115740052-0-11406";"Perhaps they have trained these giant creatures to dance or sing! That would be amazing to see!"
"115740052-0-11407";"<Thane Unnvald screams in pain.>"
"115740052-0-11408";"Quickly, to the ship! We must prevent the Maormer from finding the manifest!"
"115740052-0-11409";"What's that? Some sort of marinade?"
"115740052-0-11410";"Good thinking, outsider. You'll fit in here, yet."
"115740052-0-11413";"I'll take root in <<1>> for as long as I can."
"115740052-0-11414";"Your efforts are wasted. Come to the waterfall. Follow the light."
"115740052-0-11415";"So you want to make some City flavor? Talk to me to find out how."
"115740052-0-11416";"Go away! If you're infected, you'll kill us all!"
"115740052-0-11417";"We're not infected, you idiot! I'm trying to find my husband!"
"115740052-0-11419";"I don't care if you're looking for Nerevar. You're not getting in here."
"115740052-0-11420";"This is getting us nowhere. There's got to be another entrance through the crypts."
"115740052-0-11421";"You can't defeat me that easily!"
"115740052-0-11422";"You'll never defeat the Worm Cult!"
"115740052-0-11423";"You think you'd stand against the Worm Cult? We will have her soul!"
"115740052-0-11424";"I can't hold on much longer."
"115740052-0-11426";"I was relieved to hear that they discovered a cure for the Llodos plague."
"115740052-0-11427";"I heard the plague took quite a toll before it was finally stopped."
"115740052-0-11428";"It was a troubling time. But now we restore our towns and our farms. We Dark Elves find strength in adversity."
"115740052-0-11429";"I'll do anything to see <<1>> take root in this sacred grove!"
"115740052-0-11431";"I heard the Orcthane stole his sister's body from the Royal Crypt in Fort Morvunskar."
"115740052-0-11433";"I don't understand Nord burial traditions, but why in the world would he do such a thing? The dead should be left in peace."
"115740052-0-11436";"Who knows what drives a man like Fildgor? But it's an insult to our great queen! And it's also kind of creepy."
"115740052-0-11437";"Have you been to Windhelm yet? I hear the Konunleikar festivities are amazing."
"115740052-0-11438";"The corn and what? Don't take this the wrong way, but you Nords seem to constantly celebrate everything."
"115740052-0-11439";"Yes, I suppose we do. We work hard and we play harder! But the Konunleikar is special. It honors the Skald-King's ten years on the throne."
"115740052-0-11440";"Your soul will be mine!"
"115740052-0-11441";"Fildgor was defeated in fair combat ten years ago. No honorable Nord would accept him as king now."
"115740052-0-11442";"And he adds to his dishonor, bringing these Orc bastards to fight for him. Calls himself Orcthane. Bah!"
"115740052-0-11443";"The Orcs are fearless fighters, though. I'll give them that. Pity we have to kill them all."
"115740052-0-11444";"Follow me, valiant. I'll lead you out."
"115740052-0-11445";"Did you see that Dark Elf, Naryu? She looks good in that dress! I hope she stops by the inn soon."
"115740052-0-11446";"All these fine Nord women, and you make puppy eyes at a haughty Dark Elf? That's a waste of time. They think we're savages."
"115740052-0-11447";"But her dusk-colored skin, her fierce eyes. Her … bossiness. She just makes me want to … well, I like her!"
"115740052-0-11448";"Damn it! Broken!"
"115740052-0-11449";"Please … I'm sorry!"
"115740052-0-11450";"I can see my prison! The fortress, on the hill. Come up!"
"115740052-0-11451";"I received a letter from my sister in Narsis. She says things are back to normal now that the Llodos plague has ended."
"115740052-0-11452";"That is good news. Praise Almalexia! I thought that damned disease was going to spread forever."
"115740052-0-11453";"I'm thankful my sister and her family were spared. I know others who weren't that lucky."
"115740052-0-11454";"Join my drowned dead!"
"115740052-0-11455";"Witness my power! Drowned dead! Rise and devour!"
"115740052-0-11456";"Undead of the deep! Heed my call! Destroy!"
"115740052-0-11457";"This isn't possible!"
"115740052-0-11458";"Have you visited the tavern yet? They won't serve you anything else until you try the mead."
"115740052-0-11459";"They do go on and on about the stuff. That's why I avoid the inn. Everyone wants to buy you a mead."
"115740052-0-11460";"I avoid the inn for other reasons. Mostly because of all the loud, drinking Nords that constantly seem to fill the place."
"115740052-0-11461";"Maybe those eggs down there are in better shape. Do me a favor and take care of the undesirables down there. I'll stay here and supervise."
"115740052-0-11462";"You're not safe here, Fjora. Listen to reason."
"115740052-0-11463";"No one threatens me, you hear me?"
"115740052-0-11465";"Want to rescue the Silvenar? You must get by me first!"
"115740052-0-11466";"That's just the first group! More are coming!"
"115740052-0-11467";"Almost done! Protect me a little while longer!"
"115740052-0-11468";"Defend me till I've recovered, and we can escape!"
"115740052-0-11469";"Why do Nords love mead so much? Every inn or tavern I go to offers the stuff."
"115740052-0-11470";"Mead is delicious! And it has important historical and cultural value. Without mead, we wouldn't be Nords."
"115740052-0-11471";"An acquired taste, I suppose. Perhaps I can treat you to a glass at the Cold Moon later?"
"115740052-0-11473";"What do you think about this Ebonheart Pact Alliance? Dark Elves, Argonians, and Nords united for the common good."
"115740052-0-11474";"When the Pact was formed ten years ago, I never expected it to last. But it endures. We never would have defeated the Akaviri without each other."
"115740052-0-11475";"Indeed. Our Argonian allies have earned my respect. And I find you Nords to be an honorable and brave people. Now about that drink …?"
"115740052-0-11476";"Productive bugs, these kwama. They're practically laying money down here."
"115740052-0-11477";"Oh, this is good stuff. Old Selos must have been raking in a fortune."
"115740052-0-11478";"We'll have this place cleaned out in no time."
"115740052-0-11479";"So you believed there was gold in here. Fools."
"115740052-0-11480";"I heard that after the Queen died in battle, Fildgor challenged his brother Jorunn for the throne. Fildgor lost."
"115740052-0-11481";"What a dishonorable thing to do, to ignore the rules of succession. It's a wonder any Nord would follow Fildgor."
"115740052-0-11482";"Perhaps the Skald-King should have killed him instead of exiling him. But I imagine it would be hard to kill your only brother."
"115740052-0-11483";"Have you tried this mead the Nords are so fond of? It's rather sweet and tasty."
"115740052-0-11484";"Yes. I had no choice. You can't seem to turn around in this city without some burly Nord woman foisting the stuff on you."
"115740052-0-11485";"I met a Nord who said he was planning to re-open a nearby meadery. Called the place Voljar's, I think. He kept rambling on about bees."
"115740052-0-11486";"Wriggle all you want, little worm. These fish will not escape my hook."
"115740052-0-11487";"Enjoy the taste of success. These morsels have to sleep again. Sometime."
"115740052-0-11488";"I know. But I must retake Fallowstone. I fear the worst. Let's go. We can talk on the way."
"115740052-0-11489";"Yes sir! I'll see if I can't head him off!"
"115740052-0-11490";"<<1>>, I've heard reports that the Reach are moving all their prisoners to Northwind Mine. Get up there, see what's going on. This is far larger in scope than I first thought!"
"115740052-0-11491";"Whatever you say! I'll see what I can find out."
"115740052-0-11492";"You ask too many questions."
"115740052-0-11493";"A murder? On my watch!"
"115740052-0-11494";"My brethren move to take Nimalten. They need you out of the way."
"115740052-0-11495";"I doubt I could take you in a fair fight. Luckily, I don't have to."
"115740052-0-11496";"Drop those weapons, murderer!"
"115740052-0-11497";"You'll pay for this, Sadri!"
"115740052-0-11498";"Ah, Nervyna. I suspected you were smarter than your father."
"115740052-0-11500";"Well, well … you'll have to catch me first!"
"115740052-0-11501";"By Vivec, no!"
"115740052-0-11502";"How goes the investigation?"
"115740052-0-11504";"I will locate my equipment, and join you on the boat."
"115740052-0-11505";"A book! We've made a book! Now the bard can sing the story!"
"115740052-0-11506";"Stay back! It's still here!"
"115740052-0-11507";"It's here!"
"115740052-0-11508";"What's your plan, Gjakil?"
"115740052-0-11509";"You're too late, worm! My gem strips your Captain of her memories as we speak!"
"115740052-0-11510";"Why do you fight? You are merely a pawn of the Thalmor."
"115740052-0-11511";"No. It cannot end this way!"
"115740052-0-11512";"<<1>>! Someone's broken into the brewery!"
"115740052-0-11513";"I'm headed for Boulderfall outpost. Sinmur stomped in that direction."
"115740052-0-11517";"Kyne guard you, my friend. Good luck. I'll see you again soon."
"115740052-0-11518";"Vigrod."
"115740052-0-11519";"Tovisa! What news?"
"115740052-0-11520";"The Reachmen take their prisoners to Northwind Mine. That settlement has been lost to the tribes."
"115740052-0-11521";"As always, you're my eyes and ears. Head back there. I'll send you relief as soon as we've secured the Hall."
"115740052-0-11522";"The Three watch your steps."
"115740052-0-11526";"Pain makes victim delirious. She falls in and out of consciousness. The troll bite is enflamed and it begins to ooze."
"115740052-0-11527";"Please, Stormy. There must be something you can do."
"115740052-0-11531";"We'll keep back until the way is clear."
"115740052-0-11532";"It has to be in here somewhere. It has to be!"
"115740052-0-11534";"No! Bath salts bad!"
"115740052-0-11535";"Meet me down near the barn! We need to stick this ugly head on a pike!"
"115740052-0-11536";"You help those who let the innocent die. You're no better than they are!"
"115740052-0-11538";"Run! Run my wolf brethren! Save yourselves!"
"115740052-0-11539";"Prepare for ultimate relaxation!"
"115740052-0-11540";"Come on! Open!"
"115740052-0-11541";"You want me? Come and get me."
"115740052-0-11542";"Hey! Over here! Behind the roots and corpses!"
"115740052-0-11543";"Aelif is certain we'll find what we need just beyond this door."
"115740052-0-11544";"Who are you to disturb our roots?"
"115740052-0-11545";"The Green cries out! What poisons it?"
"115740052-0-11546";"Are you here as a friend, or an enemy?"
"115740052-0-11547";"If you want to try again, Fjar, you only need to ask."
"115740052-0-11548";"Why? So you can embarrass me again, lizard? I don't think so."
"115740052-0-11549";"It can be done. Don't give up yet."
"115740052-0-11550";"You cheated, Vurila! Sharp, pointy arrows aren't good enough for Dark Elves! You had to make your arrows explode!"
"115740052-0-11551";"Why do you care what arrows I used? The lizard didn't care, and it's his challenge."
"115740052-0-11558";"If you want to win this contest, come talk to me."
"115740052-0-11559";"How's it feel to lose, lizard?"
"115740052-0-11560";"Shut it, scaleless one. I'm still a better hunter than you."
"115740052-0-11561";"We call upon our honored ancestors to pass on their memory and wisdom."
"115740052-0-11563";"My Queen, look out!"
"115740052-0-11565";"Your ancestors disavow you, false one! The Veiled Queen is the rightful heir, and Norion shall end your reign!"
"115740052-0-11566";"No! Wait! I …."
"115740052-0-11568";"Follow me! I'll show you a shortcut."
"115740052-0-11569";"The vine should be strong enough to hold you … I hope!"
"115740052-0-11570";"Bones and blood, bathed in red. Joined together, walking dead."
"115740052-0-11572";"Thallik … I failed."
"115740052-0-11573";"Help me! She's gone mad!"
"115740052-0-11575";"May the spirit of our ancestors bless us and guide us."
"115740052-0-11576";"May we honor their memories with our actions and our thoughts."
"115740052-0-11577";"The seed takes root!"
"115740052-0-11578";"The Ancients bless you for your prayers."
"115740052-0-11579";"Bitter and dull, drink blood from your skull. Rise up, darkness. Rise up!"
"115740052-0-11580";"You won't stop her. You won't stop her. She'll eat your heart. Devour it whole. Never stop her. Never, never, never …."
"115740052-0-11581";"Protect me as I complete my prayers to the ancestors!"
"115740052-0-11582";"I'll use the sphere to destroy our enemies!"
"115740052-0-11583";"Die with the rest of the stormwardens!"
"115740052-0-11588";"May the ancestors bless you."
"115740052-0-11589";"May the ancients guide you through your days."
"115740052-0-11590";"May we be honored by your humble prayers and offerings to us."
"115740052-0-11591";"Go on. I'll gather my things and be right behind you."
"115740052-0-11592";"You can't stop us! What was started long ago shall finally be completed!"
"115740052-0-11593";"We shall join as one. Molag Bal, accept our offering! Make us your weapon! Make us invincible!"
"115740052-0-11594";"You will be the first sacrifice to our lord, Molag Bal! Now you shall witness our power!"
"115740052-0-11596";"What is that stuff, Dralof? It burns!"
"115740052-0-11597";"This doesn't feel very relaxing."
"115740052-0-11602";"Yes, of course! The knife must be destroyed as well. Throw it in!"
"115740052-0-11603";"Where are you going with those weapons?"
"115740052-0-11604";"You face the Skald King now, Worms! Come and die on my blade!"
"115740052-0-11606";"You let my family die in Bal Foyen. The Worm Cult will bring them back to me and you're in the way."
"115740052-0-11607";"The Worms crumble before us! <<1>> awaits. Stand strong and he will fall before us!"
"115740052-0-11609";"Shor's Bones! The monster's down! Well done, my friends, well done!"
"115740052-0-11610";"You let them die!"
"115740052-0-11611";"Damn you!"
"115740052-0-11612";"You are no queen, Ayrenn. You are a spoiled child. Give up this charade and let the Veiled Queen lead our people to glory!"
"115740052-0-11613";"You hear about Master Selos? Poor bastard got it in his sleep. They're still looking for the guy that did it. Just goes to show that no one is safe I guess."
"115740052-0-11614";"Follow me, and stay close!"
"115740052-0-11615";"Hold! I was sent for you!"
"115740052-0-11616";"Ambush! Watch yourself."
"115740052-0-11618";"The ancestors have forsaken you, Ayrenn!"
"115740052-0-11620";"Did you think it would be easy to enter my shrine? Your pain amuses me."
"115740052-0-11621";"This will be quick."
"115740052-0-11622";"There. It's done."
"115740052-0-11623";"Let's go."
"115740052-0-11624";"I ask you, scale-scholar: what is the Hist?"
"115740052-0-11625";"The trees themselves. The ground beneath our feet? The water that flows down the river? The breath of a new eggling?"
"115740052-0-11626";"All are correct. The Hist flows from the sap to our veins, and connects everything in between."
"115740052-0-11627";"Now to find the others."
"115740052-0-11628";"Meldil! Thank Auri-El he's still alive!"
"115740052-0-11629";"Meldil. Have you seen the others?"
"115740052-0-11630";"Martyrs of Mauloch! Blood of the Forgotten Tribe! Hear our call for vengeance!"
"115740052-0-11631";"Quickly, head to the barn!"
"115740052-0-11632";"Fool! You think you can trifle with the Veiled Heritance and live to tell the tale?"
"115740052-0-11635";"Foolish girl! Our people will never name you their queen!"
"115740052-0-11636";"The Veiled Queen will lead us!"
"115740052-0-11637";"Nothing will stop Mauloch's rise from Ashpit!"
"115740052-0-11638";"Why struggle, Ayrenn? This can only end one way!"
"115740052-0-11639";"Kill this weakling! Prove you are worthy of my presence."
"115740052-0-11640";"Pathetic. Kill this whelp!"
"115740052-0-11641";"You waded through Molag Bal's own minions like a mammoth through grass.\n\nImpressive, whelp. I will be watching … and waiting."
"115740052-0-11642";"I've found the Mallari-Mora! The secrets of Aetherius will be mine!"
"115740052-0-11643";"Traveler, I must speak with you. Meet me at the vault entrance on the ruin's edge."
"115740052-0-11644";"Sal, where are you?"
"115740052-0-11648";"You have betrayed your people!"
"115740052-0-11649";"Mercy and civility is for the weak!"
"115740052-0-11650";"True Altmer do not consort with savages and beasts!"
"115740052-0-11651";"Foolish girl! I serve the Veiled Queen! She is our true leader!"
"115740052-0-11652";"The last urn's above us. Hurry! The Worm's binding me to his will."
"115740052-0-11653";"What separates us, one from the other?"
"115740052-0-11654";"Scales, skin, blood and bone? We are one in the Hist, of course."
"115740052-0-11655";"No. Nothing separates us. The Hist is then, now, and forever. We are always one in the Hist."
"115740052-0-11656";"Another question. The river's current carries away an egg-brother. What do you feel?"
"115740052-0-11657";"I feel nothing. My egg-brother would be one with the Hist, returned and whole."
"115740052-0-11658";"Those we meet on the river nourish us, just as the Hist does. Enjoy their presence, mourn their loss, and rejoice in the Hist."
"115740052-0-11659";"Good luck!"
"115740052-0-11663";"What's this?"
"115740052-0-11664";"Look alive, soldiers! We've got wolves to skin!"
"115740052-0-11665";"Your lives are forfeit!"
"115740052-0-11666";"The ancestors honor your prayers."
"115740052-0-11667";"May the light of the Eight bless you and guide you."
"115740052-0-11668";"Let your reign be long and peaceful."
"115740052-0-11669";"What's that horrible sound? Stop it!"
"115740052-0-11671";"It's finished. Let's get out of this dark place. Follow me."
"115740052-0-11672";"Your majesty! Let me come with you!"
"115740052-0-11673";"The ritual is complete. You may go."
"115740052-0-11674";"I can handle myself. I was a warrior long before I became a Queen!"
"115740052-0-11675";"Watch out!"
"115740052-0-11676";"I'll be back soon, madam."
"115740052-0-11679";"Rain, pour forth your healing powers."
"115740052-0-11680";"Let the waves crash!"
"115740052-0-11681";"I'll be your opponent, wretch!"
"115740052-0-11682";"I am undone!"
"115740052-0-11688";"Some is here! Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-11694";"Stop right there, criminal scum!"
"115740052-0-11699";"The shard. You seek the shard?"
"115740052-0-11700";"It gives understanding. Power."
"115740052-0-11701";"Let us test your power."
"115740052-0-11702";"Die, mortal!"
"115740052-0-11714";"What delightful folly is this?\n\nThe Keepers have enlisted an outsider to face me? You fools have fallen so low."
"115740052-0-11717";"There are easier ways to prove your bravery, mortal. Turn back, or you'll share the Keepers' fate."
"115740052-0-11718";"She came this way…"
"115740052-0-11719";"Use the fragment when you return. I'll find you."
"115740052-0-11720";"I can smell you! Stay away!"
"115740052-0-11721";"I can't control it!"
"115740052-0-11722";"Why couldn't you have left me alone?"
"115740052-0-11723";"The last urn is above us. Unless you're thinking of running?"
"115740052-0-11724";"Free me, please! The agony!"
"115740052-0-11728";"Return that book to Valaste. Tell her fire will show her the words …."
"115740052-0-11729";"Well done! I am Shalidor, young one. And I think you'll do nicely …."
"115740052-0-11730";"Help me!"
"115740052-0-11731";"Destroy that thing! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-11733";"Stars guide you! A small spell to help you along the way."
"115740052-0-11734";"A token of my thanks."
"115740052-0-11735";"My thanks. This spell will cloak you from the spirits."
"115740052-0-11736";"Here. This spell will help you move past the spirits."
"115740052-0-11737";"Ah, Telenger's latest pawn approaches. Hold a moment, before we continue the game."
"115740052-0-11738";"Leave some for the rest of us, ya lush!"
"115740052-0-11739";"Beware!"
"115740052-0-11740";"Magic bars the gate!"
"115740052-0-11741";"Finally out of those caves!"
"115740052-0-11742";"Giants!"
"115740052-0-11743";"This smell funny to you? Eh, bottoms up!"
"115740052-0-11744";"I have no way to truly repay you, friend."
"115740052-0-11746";"Stop! You can't cross. Molag Bal's demons rampage in the Imperial City!"
"115740052-0-11747";"An enemy approaches! Attack!"
"115740052-0-11748";"This one is trouble, we must finish this quickly."
"115740052-0-11749";"I saw the face of Stral Blackthroat. Please, let me forget!"
"115740052-0-11750";"Vigrod … how could you abandon us?"
"115740052-0-11751";"I refuse to fall to Blackthroat's fury! Vigrod, curse you for leaving us!"
"115740052-0-11752";"Your minions are defeated, your reign is over. Begone!"
"115740052-0-11753";"I refuse to let go. Sovngarde will not have me!"
"115740052-0-11754";"Vigrod … you left us to die!"
"115740052-0-11755";"Slithering seaweed. Do you return for more pain?"
"115740052-0-11756";"Now! Strike while we can."
"115740052-0-11757";"Even your rage empowers me. Now die."
"115740052-0-11758";"I'm staying here till Silsailen is safe again."
"115740052-0-11760";"Thank you. I'll untie the rest. You get that gear for us."
"115740052-0-11761";"Come on, help us out here. We have deadlines to meet!"
"115740052-0-11762";"You know the rules. No one's allowed inside without authorization and I don't see your paperwork."
"115740052-0-11763";"I don't believe this. I'm not leaving until you let us in."
"115740052-0-11764";"They're all the same! Give a Nord a helmet and they get all high and mighty. It's no wonder the palace is still a wreck."
"115740052-0-11767";"Sadri! You double-crosser."
"115740052-0-11768";"The gold, Tervur. Where's the gold?"
"115740052-0-11769";"Think you can make fools of us, Sadri? Get him!"
"115740052-0-11770";"Justice is done. I must return to my squad. Fare well."
"115740052-0-11772";"See you at the Beach."
"115740052-0-11773";"Get 'em!"
"115740052-0-11774";"Thank you."
"115740052-0-11775";"Good luck."
"115740052-0-11776";"Did you see that? The lighthouse beacon exploded!"
"115740052-0-11777";"I see it! The … the tower is on fire!"
"115740052-0-11778";"How did this happen? What will we do?"
"115740052-0-11779";"I can't allow you to muck about in here. Know that it was Varaine Pellingare who ended your life."
"115740052-0-11780";"Help me, please! The Worm Cult…."
"115740052-0-11781";"The Worms are undoing my essence, tearing at my spirit. Stop them!"
"115740052-0-11782";"The ritual's almost complete. Stop the Worms!"
"115740052-0-11783";"Oh no! Here they come again!"
"115740052-0-11784";"Please, help me! They killed my family!"
"115740052-0-11785";"Difficult riddle, that one."
"115740052-0-11786";"Guess who knows the answer to that riddle?"
"115740052-0-11787";"You'll never figure that out alone."
"115740052-0-11788";"Yiri! Look out!"
"115740052-0-11789";"We're losing her. Amuur! Bring me that salve!"
"115740052-0-11790";"Quickly!"
"115740052-0-11791";"This is the last of the salve, sir. I hope it's enough."
"115740052-0-11792";"We can get more later. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-11793";"Yes, just like that. Apply the salve."
"115740052-0-11794";"Please. Don't let me die."
"115740052-0-11795";"She's alive. That's all that matters. Take her to quarantine."
"115740052-0-11796";"Everyone! Today we add a new name to the Guardian rolls."
"115740052-0-11797";"A champion, standing here beside me, will watch over the Rift. Let us cheer this victory!"
"115740052-0-11798";"Your loot or your life… On second thought, I'll have them both."
"115740052-0-11799";"Get over here, you mug! This one's putting up a fight!"
"115740052-0-11800";"Hey, get off your butt and make with the killing!"
"115740052-0-11801";"Watch out! The giants are hurling boulders into the arena!"
"115740052-0-11802";"Lob's dead! Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-11803";"I can't believe they killed a skald. A bladeless minstrel."
"115740052-0-11804";"Thanks. What about Viveka? Gullveig dragged her into that damned cave. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-11805";"We'll begin with the tale of <<1>>, Ysgramor's son."
"115740052-0-11806";"This next shrine is to <<1>>. He led the Companions alongside Ysgramor as the Nord tide swept the elves from Skyrim."
"115740052-0-11807";"One of <<1>>'s greatest accomplishments was taking up the mantle of leadership upon the death of Ysgramor. The Companions would have fallen apart if not for his commanding presence."
"115740052-0-11808";"The last shrine is to <<1>>, the harbinger of us all. He led the Companions to Skyrim and drove the elves howling to distant lands."
"115740052-0-11810";"With his mighty axe Wuuthrad in hand, none could resist Ysgramor. Soon, all foes fled before him."
"115740052-0-11811";"Only one, the dread half-giant Sinmur, leader of Skyrim's giant clans, dared to face Wuuthrad and Ysgramor."
"115740052-0-11815";"Companions! Rise and honor Skald Svari as she ascends to the post of Sage."
"115740052-0-11816";"<<1>>, we are here to honor your courage, wisdom, and strength. You have proven yourself worthy to be our next Sage."
"115740052-0-11817";"Do you swear to uphold the tenets of the Companions and to defend Fallowstone Hall with your life?"
"115740052-0-11818";"I do."
"115740052-0-11819";"You want my soul? Just try and take it, Worm!"
"115740052-0-11820";"Nice work. The axe shard is nearby. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-11822";"Help! Giants!"
"115740052-0-11824";"Hide from my song, my pet."
"115740052-0-11825";"Intruder! Get them! Kill them!"
"115740052-0-11826";"Well, well. Our intruders seem to have found us."
"115740052-0-11827";"I'm afraid I can't take let you reveal my identity to the city magistrate. It might be bad for business."
"115740052-0-11829";"Please, get in front of me as I start playing."
"115740052-0-11830";"To arms! We're under attack!"
"115740052-0-11831";"Sorry, did you say something? I was deep in thought…"
"115740052-0-11832";"Allene Pellingare! I should have known your family was behind this!"
"115740052-0-11833";"Fool! Don't just stand there! Do something!"
"115740052-0-11835";"Investigator Lienne? You are a meddlesome little wench! Are these fools with you? You can all die together."
"115740052-0-11836";"Your father is already on his way, Allene. Surrender now. Don't bring any further shame on your family."
"115740052-0-11837";"I'll cut your heart out, you whore-spawn!"
"115740052-0-11838";"Impressive deeds, hero. One of my Companions could not have done better. Celebrate your victory!"
"115740052-0-11840";"I'll make the new batch right away, sir."
"115740052-0-11842";"Allene! No!"
"115740052-0-11843";"Make this batch extra potent, Amuur."
"115740052-0-11844";"It's ready, sir. I put an extra dose in. Here you go."
"115740052-0-11846";"To me, men! Let these curs taste steel!"
"115740052-0-11847";"Hold!"
"115740052-0-11848";"I'll put you down myself, dog!"
"115740052-0-11849";"What …?"
"115740052-0-11852";"They took out my whole brigade, and I'm ready for some payback. Let's move!"
"115740052-0-11853";"Charge!"
"115740052-0-11854";"This one shall open the door!"
"115740052-0-11855";"leaves the grove and dies."
"115740052-0-11856";"You'll never leave here, alive."
"115740052-0-11857";"Take them down!"
"115740052-0-11858";"I've had enough of this. End it, now!"
"115740052-0-11859";"No …. This can't be! I will not fail!"
"115740052-0-11860";"I'll handle this myself!"
"115740052-0-11861";"I must return …. Estre will make me stronger!"
"115740052-0-11862";"Rilis! Not so fast!"
"115740052-0-11863";"Ah, good. Now let's see if I can banish the Daedric influence from this creature."
"115740052-0-11864";"Hm. That should not have happened."
"115740052-0-11865";"High Kinlord Rilis!"
"115740052-0-11866";"You're safe."
"115740052-0-11867";"Over here! Come help me!"
"115740052-0-11868";"Bring the reserves! And seal the exits. We must be cautious."
"115740052-0-11869";"O my sweet love, she waits for me,\nThrough storm and shine, cross land or sea.\nI run to her and together we,\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss"
"115740052-0-11870";"Her graceful shape I heave up high\nAnd in one hand I hold her nigh\nHer waiting lips are never dry\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss"
"115740052-0-11871";"Come the morn, she goes \nThe taste of her remains\nAnd in my mind, I see us sway\nSway as we kiss\nSway as we kiss"
"115740052-0-11872";"Hurry, Amuur! We've got to get back before someone notices we're gone."
"115740052-0-11873";"Someone's here! Leave him! We must find Tancano!"
"115740052-0-11874";"I'll see you back at camp!"
"115740052-0-11875";"Sure thing! I'll meet you by the well in town."
"115740052-0-11876";"Hold them, Amuur. We can't let them get any further. They can't know the truth!"
"115740052-0-11877";"I sensed the field disperse. I would speak with you."
"115740052-0-11882";"Son, let me in! They can't find you like this! They'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-11883";"Tancano! They're coming for you!"
"115740052-0-11884";"It's a good thing the Wood Orcs didn't get as far as the marketplace!"
"115740052-0-11885";"Are you kidding? They overran the inn and the barracks."
"115740052-0-11886";"Get back! Don't hurt him! It's not his fault!"
"115740052-0-11887";"At least they're gone now, thanks to the Fists and our new militia!"
"115740052-0-11888";"The new blood smells fresh. Please, father. Let them in."
"115740052-0-11889";"Fresh blood! And my next thrall!"
"115740052-0-11890";"Don't hurt him! He's just sick! He'll get better!"
"115740052-0-11891";"My son. Tancano? Why did the gods curse him?"
"115740052-0-11892";"What do we have here? A lamb sent to slaughter?"
"115740052-0-11893";"You dare challenge the power of Mehrunes Dagon?"
"115740052-0-11894";"Flame atronachs, shield me!"
"115740052-0-11895";"Estre! Stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-11896";"Madness? This is power! True power!"
"115740052-0-11897";"Estre! You've gone too far!"
"115740052-0-11898";"No! I've only gone where Ayrenn fears to tread!"
"115740052-0-11899";"It sickens me. You pawns cling to life!"
"115740052-0-11900";"Watch out for those sigils on the ground!"
"115740052-0-11901";"Destroy the stone. We'll see you back in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-11902";"At last, my transformation is complete! Now you die, you all die!"
"115740052-0-11903";"What are you doing? Get away from me!"
"115740052-0-11914";"What a fascinating result!"
"115740052-0-11915";"Oh. Oh no. You're not the right person!"
"115740052-0-11916";"I found you!"
"115740052-0-11917";"Here, take this. I'm so sorry."
"115740052-0-11918";"Be thankful you two don't have any children. My daughter Allene is distant and aloof, and my son is a sniveling coward. It makes me fearful about the future of the Pellingare family."
"115740052-0-11919";"If you see my daughter Allene, tell her I want to speak with her. That girl needs to get her head on straight."
"115740052-0-11920";"Let me just get this open."
"115740052-0-11922";"No! <<1>> is mine! All mine!"
"115740052-0-11923";"What? What's happening?"
"115740052-0-11924";"So warm. Never thought I'd feel warmth again."
"115740052-0-11925";"My friend! We have a problem!"
"115740052-0-11926";"Let's get out of this dump, boys. They got nothin' for us here."
"115740052-0-11928";"What? What happened to me?"
"115740052-0-11929";"I haven't seen her since the attack. I've got to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-11930";"No, only the raging Drublog. Z'en, why have you abandoned us?"
"115740052-0-11931";"No, the poor girl. I can't imagine these beasts left her alive!"
"115740052-0-11932";"Dalaneth! No! She didn't deserve this!"
"115740052-0-11933";"C'mon, fish! I know you're out there!"
"115740052-0-11938";"I have seen it from a distance. Too many people and too much noise for me."
"115740052-0-11943";"You ready? Let's go see what we're up against."
"115740052-0-11944";"That's it, right? I thought they were going to kill us both!"
"115740052-0-11945";"I forbid it, young lady! No daughter of mine is going to be courted by a Nord stable boy."
"115740052-0-11946";"Oh, mother, but I'm bored! There hasn't been anyone to flirt with except Orama since we reached these wretched shores. And she's no fun to flirt with at all."
"115740052-0-11947";"I don't know why I bother guarding you horrible people."
"115740052-0-11948";"I won another stupid contest today."
"115740052-0-11949";"That's the plan. What do you want, a medal?"
"115740052-0-11950";"Ooo! If I win a contest, can I get a medal? I like medals."
"115740052-0-11951";"This is what we came here for. Let's take out these buggers!"
"115740052-0-11953";"That is your proof—planted goods?"
"115740052-0-11954";"You did it! Now, I must perform the ritual."
"115740052-0-11956";"I protest this treatment."
"115740052-0-11957";"Shut up! I always knew you were up to something."
"115740052-0-11958";"Tell it to the skeevers. Now move!"
"115740052-0-11963";"Success! Just one more ward to go!"
"115740052-0-11964";"The wards are down! Find Razum-dar! He'll get you moving."
"115740052-0-11965";"There you are. I'm leaving,"
"115740052-0-11966";"Why should I care?"
"115740052-0-11967";"Are you kidding? You were there. You saw what I saw. Those… things… tore Sylas apart."
"115740052-0-11969";"I told you we weren't going to talk about that didn't I?"
"115740052-0-11970";"Yes, but get your stuff and join me. When those things come out of Arx, they aren't going to care who is in their way. They're going to destroy everything … just like Sylas!"
"115740052-0-11971";"Listen, what happened to Sylas was bad, I know, but I'm not going to abandon my post here for some childish fears you have. You want to run and get yourself killed in some backwater town? Go ahead."
"115740052-0-11972";"And what if they show up here? You're just going to die here? You can't fight those things."
"115740052-0-11973";"Better to die with a sword in my hand then with claws at my back. Listen, you do what you want to do but I'm staying here."
"115740052-0-11974";"Fine."
"115740052-0-11975";"The picture of true love, those two!"
"115740052-0-11976";"Don't ruin such an innocent love."
"115740052-0-11978";"An accountant's greed is rarely distracted. Come, speak with me."
"115740052-0-11979";"May the ancestors bless us with their wisdom and protection."
"115740052-0-11980";"Let's end this."
"115740052-0-11981";"Norion got what he deserved. Time this ritual was ended."
"115740052-0-11982";"A very disgraced general overcomes her anger. How very uplifting."
"115740052-0-11983";"True love denied. How interesting. How cruel."
"115740052-0-11984";"He fears others, yet you force him from seclusion. How kind."
"115740052-0-11985";"Thank you for your help but, sadly, you're no longer useful to me. Prepare for death!"
"115740052-0-11986";"Good, you're both here. We're going after Estre."
"115740052-0-11987";"My men are here to ensure order, madam. You approved Hendil's contract yourself."
"115740052-0-11988";"When Hendil first proposed this, I had no idea things would get so bad."
"115740052-0-11989";"And your security is my concern. Stay with your family. Keep them healthy."
"115740052-0-11990";"You can't know the truth!"
"115740052-0-11991";"… and thus I elevate Estre and bestow on her —"
"115740052-0-11992";"Another fool going to an early grave."
"115740052-0-11994";"You have done well, Mystic. Continue to follow my plan."
"115740052-0-11995";"Send more bodies as you finish with them. We need all you can supply."
"115740052-0-11996";"The Pact draws closer; remain strong. If we succeed, all these lands will belong to the Reach!"
"115740052-0-11997";"How could you think that? Are you mad?"
"115740052-0-11998";"Don't you see? No one stands between us now! Our life together can begin!"
"115740052-0-11999";"What? No, Raerana! Everything I did, it was all for you, for us!"
"115740052-0-12000";"You are mad! You killed everyone I love! Get away from me!"
"115740052-0-12001";"No! Get away! Ahh!"
"115740052-0-12002";"Ahhh, morsels for me."
"115740052-0-12003";"Blasphemer! First your eyeballs, then your face!"
"115740052-0-12004";"Merormo. For your crimes against the laws of the Aldmeri Dominion, and nature herself, you are hereby sentenced to death. Guards!"
"115740052-0-12005";"What's the trouble out there, younglings? Konia, Brunna—answer me!"
"115740052-0-12006";"My attendants! How you will suffer!"
"115740052-0-12007";"Fine! Fine. Ware, though. My men tell me of outsiders in town. Keep an eye out."
"115740052-0-12009";"What is this? New treats for me?"
"115740052-0-12010";"My sisters! You will pay for this forever!"
"115740052-0-12013";"Fire on the deck!"
"115740052-0-12016";"Hold! I must speak with you."
"115740052-0-12017";"Wake up, new friend. Wake up!"
"115740052-0-12018";"Now, out of here! Save the Queen."
"115740052-0-12028";"You again? Get out of here! This is none of your concern!"
"115740052-0-12029";"Revenge!"
"115740052-0-12030";"A moment, Urcelmo. I would hear what this one has to say."
"115740052-0-12031";"Queen Ayrenn, I fear for your safety. Please disregard what was said just—"
"115740052-0-12033";"Razum-dar was mentioned. He acts on my behalf. If you won't investigate, I will."
"115740052-0-12035";"Apologies, my queen. As you will."
"115740052-0-12036";"You are a capable woman. But you must be wary."
"115740052-0-12037";"You, come with me. We'll investigate the temple together."
"115740052-0-12038";"Hold it right there!"
"115740052-0-12041";"It's a trap!"
"115740052-0-12042";"Urcelmo! I see you've met my latest toy."
"115740052-0-12043";"Astanya! Traitor! Come down here and face me!"
"115740052-0-12044";"Our ""Queen"" has betrayed us. I wanted her head. I'll settle for yours!"
"115740052-0-12045";"Kill them!"
"115740052-0-12046";"I'll eat your heart!"
"115740052-0-12047";"Let's tell Malanie about that damn cat lurking around here."
"115740052-0-12048";"Aye. If Razum-dar is near, then trouble usually follows."
"115740052-0-12049";"So be it, Astanya!"
"115740052-0-12050";"It's not over yet, Battlereeve!"
"115740052-0-12051";"The Dominion won't last. The Veiled Heritance will see to that!"
"115740052-0-12052";"The Dominion will last long after your corpse cools! Now come down here and face your death!"
"115740052-0-12053";"Incompetents! I'll have to take care you myself."
"115740052-0-12054";"We need to report back to the Queen. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-12055";"What are you going to do about that Dominion soldier?"
"115740052-0-12056";"They mock our traditions!"
"115740052-0-12057";"Get the Dominion scum out of here!"
"115740052-0-12059";"Pilgrims have gone missing since that Elf arrived!"
"115740052-0-12061";"Eraral-dro commanded me to stay. I can't leave!"
"115740052-0-12062";"Please, friends, I will do what I can to pass along your concerns."
"115740052-0-12063";"What about the Dominion soldier? What will you do about him?"
"115740052-0-12064";"How dare you allow this to continue!"
"115740052-0-12065";"The Dominion will harm the Hist!"
"115740052-0-12066";"The Hist will abandon us if a Dominion soldier communes with it!"
"115740052-0-12067";"The Dominion will destroy us all!"
"115740052-0-12068";"We'll have to handle this ourselves."
"115740052-0-12069";"By the Three, what's happening? What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-12070";"We did it! Er, you did it."
"115740052-0-12071";"Condalin, take our friend here."
"115740052-0-12072";"Don't worry about us, we'll find our way out."
"115740052-0-12073";"Mara be merciful. What's happened here?"
"115740052-0-12074";"We made it out. Now to see to Tovisa's injuries."
"115740052-0-12075";"The way to Shor's Stone should be clear of the Reach, I hope."
"115740052-0-12076";"Thank you. Come to the Green Ladies' shrine."
"115740052-0-12078";"Come closer. But do it slowly."
"115740052-0-12081";"I just don't know how much more of this I can take!"
"115740052-0-12082";"It's endless. Endless suffering and no refuge in sight."
"115740052-0-12083";"If only we could rest for a little while, or forever."
"115740052-0-12084";"Don't you understand? This is torture!"
"115740052-0-12085";"You're right. I don't understand. This is paradise."
"115740052-0-12086";"You're insane. You're totally and absolutely insane."
"115740052-0-12087";"I don't understand. You'd rather die than live forever?"
"115740052-0-12088";"This isn't life. It's an endless torment!"
"115740052-0-12089";"Not everyone feels that way. Don't choose death for all of us."
"115740052-0-12090";"The only queen I serve is the Veiled Queen!"
"115740052-0-12091";"You are under arrest, Canonreeve. For treason against the Queen."
"115740052-0-12092";"This is fine, traitor. We could use the exercise."
"115740052-0-12096";"Traitors. Scum!"
"115740052-0-12097";"I live only to serve the Queen!"
"115740052-0-12098";"We are finished here. Raz can't stand the stink of the forge anymore."
"115740052-0-12104";"Over here, my friend!"
"115740052-0-12106";"You cannot stop the people and their true Queen!"
"115740052-0-12107";"You're too late! The ritual is complete!"
"115740052-0-12108";"Lord Dagon, my family has been ever faithful. Now, in my hour of need, I request your aid."
"115740052-0-12109";"Your plot's exposed. Your supporters crushed. And you come crawling to your Lord. What do you have left to offer me?"
"115740052-0-12110";"Anything! Everything! I offer my very soul, if it means I have power. The power to rule."
"115740052-0-12111";"So be it. I imbue you with a taste of my true power. Corrupt the shrines in Torinaan. Then, move on to Firsthold …."
"115740052-0-12112";"Why won't everyone listen to Shaman Chirah?"
"115740052-0-12113";"Perhaps because this mess is all his fault?"
"115740052-0-12114";"He was just trying to save us. No one objected, back then."
"115740052-0-12115";"Untie me, quickly. We must find the shard!"
"115740052-0-12116";"Welcome to Shad Astula. Here you will learn to master your innate abilities and become leaders for the Pact."
"115740052-0-12117";"It won't be easy. Some of you will struggle. Others will even leave the Academy."
"115740052-0-12118";"It's up to you. Work hard and you'll prosper. Slack off, and it's back to the kwama mines."
"115740052-0-12119";"Let me tell you about the Academy grounds. Pay attention! There will be a test."
"115740052-0-12120";"Instruction halls occupy the eastern building."
"115740052-0-12121";"The testing field to the west provides a safe place to practice your spells."
"115740052-0-12122";"Administration sits atop the hill, including the Arch-Mage's office."
"115740052-0-12123";"There are a couple of rules we need to go over."
"115740052-0-12124";"You may not cast spells on other students or the instructors. You may practice on the servants, however."
"115740052-0-12125";"All students are required to remain at the Academy until the end of this season's session."
"115740052-0-12126";"Finally, report any suspicious activity to an instructor immediately."
"115740052-0-12127";"The Shad Astula Academy was founded by the Great Houses and blessed by the Tribunal."
"115740052-0-12128";"We have no connection to the mongrel Mages Guild. They accept anyone!"
"115740052-0-12129";"For the first time ever, the Academy has opened its doors to the entire Pact. You're lucky to be here. Don't squander this opportunity."
"115740052-0-12130";"Members of all the Great Houses are welcome here. Even House Dres. Provided you receive an invitation, of course."
"115740052-0-12131";"You have earned this privilege. Unless you are highborn or wealthy, of course."
"115740052-0-12132";"The highborn and wealthy grace us by their presence, and we thank them for their contributions."
"115740052-0-12133";"Use of skooma is forbidden. If you want to unwind, confine your intake to mazte and flin."
"115740052-0-12134";"Drinks stronger than that are prohibited. Except the instructors. They have free access to the beverage cellar."
"115740052-0-12135";"And the Instructors' Lounge in Administration is strictly off limits! Understand?"
"115740052-0-12136";"Maybe we should look for that hidden entrance."
"115740052-0-12139";"Please, I did just as you asked!"
"115740052-0-12140";"Yes. Yes you did."
"115740052-0-12142";"Stop Thief!"
"115740052-0-12143";"We don't abide by no riff-raff in this town."
"115740052-0-12145";"Good work, citizen."
"115740052-0-12146";"Shut your mouth. You're under arrest."
"115740052-0-12147";"Someone kill this bastard."
"115740052-0-12148";"Sure you do. Faritaale?"
"115740052-0-12149";"With pleasure."
"115740052-0-12150";"No more delays! Ready the cargo, today. I'm just waiting for the order to go through."
"115740052-0-12151";"Now the dead will rise and consume you!"
"115740052-0-12152";"Steel spit. We need to take out their commander, Bernardine. Only way to make sure they don't keep coming after Moroth."
"115740052-0-12153";"I'm ready when you are!"
"115740052-0-12154";"Those cultists'll think twice before bringing their filth around here again."
"115740052-0-12155";"This is what we came here to stop. Let's do it!"
"115740052-0-12156";"Let's go already!"
"115740052-0-12157";"Are we done? Can we get out of here now?"
"115740052-0-12158";"There they are. Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-12159";"I'm warning you. One more time and I'm throwing you out of here."
"115740052-0-12160";"That's it. You're out of here!"
"115740052-0-12161";"Thank you!"
"115740052-0-12166";"King's Arrow! I have some news you might find interesting."
"115740052-0-12167";"The Pact has found us!"
"115740052-0-12168";"Ouch!"
"115740052-0-12169";"Ugh, what hit me?"
"115740052-0-12170";"Ahh! Help! It burns!"
"115740052-0-12171";"Where'd that bastard go?"
"115740052-0-12172";"Thanks! I'll go back to the camp and let <<1>> know I'm alive."
"115740052-0-12173";"Is anyone still alive out there?"
"115740052-0-12174";"Hand in hand, we snuck through the gardens and sat on a bench beneath the moon. The way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine."
"115740052-0-12175";"Our love is forbidden. Still, we care for each other deeply. He plans to tell his parents of our love soon."
"115740052-0-12176";"Let's take her out quickly. Be done with this place."
"115740052-0-12177";"I've returned, my love. I missed you so much."
"115740052-0-12178";"The spring … it's clearing!"
"115740052-0-12179";"<<1>>'s head is thicker than I thought. My servants! To me!"
"115740052-0-12180";"My mother's necklace. She gave it to me. Told me to give it to the woman who would … who would become my wife."
"115740052-0-12182";"Apologies. I didn't expect Lodorr to be so active."
"115740052-0-12183";"Is this … is this what I think it means? Oh, Maurice! This is the happiest day of my life."
"115740052-0-12184";"I must be certain that Lodorr's essence is truly gone."
"115740052-0-12185";"I was afraid of this."
"115740052-0-12186";"Greetings, child. We have been waiting for someone to summon us."
"115740052-0-12187";"I didn't steal your necklace, my lady! I swear to you. Your son gave it to me. Maurice, please tell her!"
"115740052-0-12188";"Silence! My son would never give my necklace to a lowly serving girl. I don't know which is worse, your lies or your thieving fingers."
"115740052-0-12189";"Maurice! Please! Tell her of our love. The time we've spent together. Why won't you say anything?"
"115740052-0-12190";"I'm sure she didn't mean to steal it. She's been working awfully hard. Perhaps exhaustion …."
"115740052-0-12191";"Enough! I'll hear no more excuses. Punish her with the whip and then lock her in the tower."
"115740052-0-12194";"Don't hurt us! We give up!"
"115740052-0-12195";"What's he done to you, mother?"
"115740052-0-12196";"Thank you, and good luck!"
"115740052-0-12197";"You think you've stopped me? My corruption will spread again!"
"115740052-0-12198";"Lord Dagon, give me strength!"
"115740052-0-12199";"Step forward. And see what the Divines would show you."
"115740052-0-12203";"Meet you outside, then."
"115740052-0-12204";"From distant Atmora, my lord and father Ysgramor gathered the Five Hundred Companions. My brother Ylgar and I were proud to be among the chosen."
"115740052-0-12205";"A mighty fleet the harbinger of us all led from Atmora, across the seas to the shores of Skyrim."
"115740052-0-12206";"Firwin! I promised I'd protect you, did I not?"
"115740052-0-12207";"Come, my daughter. We'll hunt together!"
"115740052-0-12208";"I gave her this gift. We'll be a family once more!"
"115740052-0-12209";"But the tale of the landing is not mine to tell. I give way to my brother, Ylgar."
"115740052-0-12210";"Alas, my elder brother Yngol, right arm of our father, perished in a great storm during the crossing. Grieving, Lord Ysgramor and I led our diminished host onto the shores of Skyrim."
"115740052-0-12211";"Come, child. Let's get you to safety."
"115740052-0-12212";"Look, father. It's Eranamo!"
"115740052-0-12213";"You! I told you I'd kill you if I ever saw your face again!"
"115740052-0-12214";"Now, father. Don't get upset. Please, I never meant to hurt anyone."
"115740052-0-12215";"You deserve no forgiveness. Lorkhan take you!"
"115740052-0-12216";"Father, no!"
"115740052-0-12217";"Please, do something!"
"115740052-0-12218";"The elves who'd held Skyrim for time immemorial fell like grass before our blades! The Companions of Lord Ysgramor soon ruled all the land."
"115740052-0-12219";"Behind the shields and swords of the Companions, others settled here from faroff Atmora. Our people prospered and the fame of Ysgramor, harbinger of us all, spread across Tamriel."
"115740052-0-12220";"Mara guard your steps."
"115740052-0-12221";"Even the giant Sinmur fell to the might of Ysgramor and Wuuthrad!"

"115740052-0-12223";"I'm sorry, father. It had to be done."

"115740052-0-12225";"Damn it, Merormo! You coward. Statues? Restore them, now!"
"115740052-0-12226";"Good. Now, to make sure you don't teleport away."

"115740052-0-12235";"Eranamo, what you've done is unforgiveable."
"115740052-0-12236";"Fine. Your life is yours. My last act as your father is to spare you. Now leave! Flee Auridon. And never come back."

"115740052-0-12245";"For treason and murder, the sentence is death. Do you have anything to say?"
"115740052-0-12246";"Ungrateful. How can you treat your own son this way?"

"115740052-0-12334";"Time to put an end to your impudence. The Veil shall fall over Auridon! Nothing can stop it."
"115740052-0-12335";"Lower your blades, friends. This one doesn't look like a werewolf to me."
"115740052-0-12336";"My Lord, you must go now!"
"115740052-0-12337";"I will not! The Dragon does not flee its lair!"
"115740052-0-12338";"Take care of it before he causes a problem. I will not be threatened by a damn cat."
"115740052-0-12339";"Ilara. She must get out. How does she get out?"
"115740052-0-12340";"Where does she go? How does she get home?"
"115740052-0-12341";"Dark Moon. Dull claws! Where am I?"
"115740052-0-12342";"Let her out! Dark moons, let her out!"
"115740052-0-12343";"Fascinating!"
"115740052-0-12344";"Indeed."
"115740052-0-12345";"They're coming for you! Wait. What was that?"
"115740052-0-12346";"Wish me luck."
"115740052-0-12347";"Look, it's working."
"115740052-0-12348";"Almost there."
"115740052-0-12350";"What do we have here? A lizard with a crown?"
"115740052-0-12351";"Death to the King!"
"115740052-0-12355";"Disguse amulet fails."
"115740052-0-12356";"Good riddance."
"115740052-0-12357";"So you're the ones killing my precious flock."
"115740052-0-12359";"Steady, girl. We'll find a better life somewhere else."
"115740052-0-12360";"C'mon Whinnie. We've got a lot of ground to cover."
"115740052-0-12361";"Search the recruits! One of Ayrenn's agents is in disguise."
"115740052-0-12362";"You did it. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-12364";"Damn it, they're here!"
"115740052-0-12366";"Psst. Over here. Quickly."
"115740052-0-12374";"Yes? Who's there?"
"115740052-0-12376";"I am Eboric Direfrost, of Falkreath.\n\nIn the record vaults of Windhelm, I discovered that I am the last living heir of Direfrost Keep, a vast castle that my family funded through generations of witch-hunting."
"115740052-0-12377";"Make the werewolves pay!"
"115740052-0-12379";"At last, I understand! The Ice Witch placed a curse on the Birthrunes of my ancestors, and placed them in the possession of her most powerful followers. The Direfrosts cannot rest until all of the Birthrunes are consumed by the Eternal Flame!"
"115740052-0-12380";"None of these soldiers should recognize us."
"115740052-0-12381";"If we see the Centurion … he's another story."
"115740052-0-12382";"Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-12383";"I need a moment, hold on. Will you speak with me?"
"115740052-0-12384";"This is the Direfrost Flame I read about in Windhelm. Legend has it I can contact my ancestors if I light it. I'd like to know what happened here."
"115740052-0-12385";"The Marines are here. Go! We'll cover you."
"115740052-0-12386";"That was Earran. With the leader of the Pact force, Rela."
"115740052-0-12387";"Lion Guard, hold your ground!"
"115740052-0-12388";"Let's finish this!"
"115740052-0-12389";"We made it. Get in there and find General Mandin. I'll signal the others to move in."
"115740052-0-12390";"Time for me to head back to the mine. We'll take care of any Red Rook stupid enough to stick around. Ha!"
"115740052-0-12391";"We need to make plans. This sort of thing must never happen to Crosswych again."
"115740052-0-12392";"Perhaps I could help you with that."
"115740052-0-12393";"I was rather hoping you'd say that. Come, we should get started right away."
"115740052-0-12395";"Test Artie SAT 5"
"115740052-0-12396";"Test Artie SAT 6"
"115740052-0-12397";"Test Artie SAT 7"
"115740052-0-12398";"Test Artie SAT 8"
"115740052-0-12399";"Test Artie SAT 9"
"115740052-0-12400";"Test Artie SAT 10"
"115740052-0-12406";"Eranamo! Face my blade."
"115740052-0-12407";"Your men aren't as good as you think, Earran!"
"115740052-0-12409";"What's this? Earran's traitor?"
"115740052-0-12410";"Idiots! Don't let them escape."
"115740052-0-12413";"The crown is mine! Jorunn and his house will fall!"
"115740052-0-12414";"This should work."
"115740052-0-12415";"Now! Use the crystal on the stone!"
"115740052-0-12416";"Put those damn fires out! It's time to wipe out all traces of those Direnni!"
"115740052-0-12417";"I will tear you to pieces! You are nothing before me!"
"115740052-0-12418";"Get up, Ilara. You're going to the Cave."
"115740052-0-12419";"The Cave? Why? She didn't do anything! Don't put Ilara in there!"
"115740052-0-12420";"Special order from Tanion. Maybe this'll keep your shortie friend from getting out of line."
"115740052-0-12421";"One fine day in the middle of the night, two dead kings got up to fight. Back to back they faced each other, drew their bows, and stabbed themselves!"
"115740052-0-12422";"Baham might make it out of here. You're just dead weight, cat."
"115740052-0-12423";"More Direnni? Put an end to these pests. Now!"
"115740052-0-12424";"The Chill of Icereach flows through my veins. Aaaaargh!"
"115740052-0-12426";"Why did you throw her in here? She did nothing wrong!"
"115740052-0-12427";"You don't belong here, cat. None of you belong here!"
"115740052-0-12428";"I was starting to hope you weren't coming in. Look at all this treasure!"
"115740052-0-12429";"Razum-dar? What's going on here?"
"115740052-0-12430";"My Queen, this one apologizes. We must speak with you at once!"
"115740052-0-12431";"Our friend here will tell the tale."
"115740052-0-12433";"What's the meaning of this? Who let that cat in here?"
"115740052-0-12434";"Wait, what's happening? I feel … strange."
"115740052-0-12435";"My skin! My fur! What, what—aargh!"
"115740052-0-12436";"Fools can't resist cursed treasure! Now you are mine to control. Kill the intruder!"
"115740052-0-12437";"By the Eight, what's happening? I can't see!"
"115740052-0-12438";"Very well. If you will excuse me, Your Majesty, I have much to do."
"115740052-0-12439";"Hope he's done with her soon. This place gives me the creeps."
"115740052-0-12440";"Yah. Bats are as bloodthirsty as the shorties. The spiders about as pretty as a cat."
"115740052-0-12441";"Just another cave pest. End them!"
"115740052-0-12442";"You'll never break us!"
"115740052-0-12443";"You'll never leave here alive."
"115740052-0-12446";"Another Dominion hound, sniffing around where they're not wanted!"
"115740052-0-12447";"Well, well. A mortal? Oh, what fun we shall have together!"
"115740052-0-12448";"How are you resisting me? I can't seem to grasp your soul!"
"115740052-0-12449";"By the Eight, I'm finally free!"
"115740052-0-12450";"Done looking around? Want to see what things are really like?"
"115740052-0-12452";"Captain Landare!"
"115740052-0-12453";"Artinaire? Report!"
"115740052-0-12454";"It's the Daedra, Captain! They've returned in force!"
"115740052-0-12455";"We've been overrun. I barely made it back. We—"
"115740052-0-12456";"Arti! What happened?"
"115740052-0-12457";"They're back, Captain. The patrols may not last long!"
"115740052-0-12458";"Curse this town!"
"115740052-0-12460";"Zaban!"
"115740052-0-12461";"Intruders! Quickly. Awaken Mistress Bandu!"
"115740052-0-12462";"Hey! Give my falcon back!"
"115740052-0-12467";"I am free, at last. But the crone of Icereach still lives!"
"115740052-0-12468";"You have come to a very bad place."
"115740052-0-12469";"I am myself again!"
"115740052-0-12470";"Have you come to kill us, Lizard Bones?"
"115740052-0-12471";"No, I have come to save you. Listen to me, child."
"115740052-0-12472";"Your troops grow weak, Thallik. The Worm Cult isn't what it once was. And this mage isn't going to change that."
"115740052-0-12473";"You throw peasants at me, Estre. You confuse weakness with boredom. My mage will do just fine."
"115740052-0-12474";"Believe what you will. When I am victorious and you grovel before me, I will remind you of this moment and how wrong you were."
"115740052-0-12475";"You two bicker like a couple of married old Nords. You didn't even notice the new arrival."
"115740052-0-12476";"Another one? Where do they all come from? I swear, they pop up like rabbits."
"115740052-0-12477";"This one is different. Special. I think this one will make a good addition to my team."
"115740052-0-12478";"You want to help them, Tsona-Ei? Fool! You can't defy the Crown of Bones. Kill them!"
"115740052-0-12479";"No! I can't! Not my own blood!"
"115740052-0-12480";"Ha ha ha. Most entertaining."
"115740052-0-12481";"Eagles? Forward!"
"115740052-0-12482";"Take the docks! Remember South Beacon!"
"115740052-0-12483";"I hope I remember the recipe correctly. It's been so long since I tried to do anything more complicated than downing a mug of mead in one gulp."
"115740052-0-12484";"One more thing … there! That should do it!"
"115740052-0-12485";"Take the potion and pour it into the three casks. I … need … some mead!"
"115740052-0-12486";"I will manipulate the anchor and summon the portal!"
"115740052-0-12487";"Hurry, we must go now!"
"115740052-0-12488";"Don't think I don't know what you're up to! Now, die!"
"115740052-0-12489";"You persist in your folly. Well, then, come in and be killed."
"115740052-0-12490";"As heir to the name Rilis, I command the vault be open!"
"115740052-0-12491";"Sorondil! Leave this place, bastard. Or face the wrath of my loyal guards!"
"115740052-0-12492";"Father! I'm your son! Don't turn me away. It's mine by right!"
"115740052-0-12494";"Ignorant blood sack! I'll have your skull for a drinking cup!"
"115740052-0-12504";"Raynor? Get your head out of that book! It's time to leave this horrible place."
"115740052-0-12505";"Leave me alone, sister. I'm busy."
"115740052-0-12506";"That does it! Remember, Raynor, you asked for this!"
"115740052-0-12507";"Kireth! What was that for? I—wait, where am I?"
"115740052-0-12508";"Works every time."
"115740052-0-12509";"And Pirtar. He's the last."
"115740052-0-12510";"All right. We'll find them."
"115740052-0-12512";"Got it! Meet you inside."
"115740052-0-12513";"Good, you all made it. Here's the plan."
"115740052-0-12518";"Sorondil, what's happening? What did you do?"
"115740052-0-12519";"Don't worry, mother. It's safe now. Trust me."
"115740052-0-12521";"Thank you!"
"115740052-0-12522";"Rise Sinmur! Return, and taste the blood of Ysgramor's heirs!"
"115740052-0-12523";"There's plenty of mead. Plenty for everyone! Drink up!"
"115740052-0-12524";"Our celebration will never end, my friends. Drink up! There's plenty more!"
"115740052-0-12526";"Wretched child! Leave this place."
"115740052-0-12527";"Leave me! I'm a Rilis and I'm here for what is rightfully mine!"
"115740052-0-12528";"As you wish, bastard. Guards, take him!"
"115740052-0-12530";"We may never know what happened to us, but at least we are no longer lost in a fog of mead and enchantment."
"115740052-0-12531";"No! Stop them!"
"115740052-0-12532";"Protect me. I'll return the favor once I have my helm."
"115740052-0-12533";"We'll make our way to the Hollow City, when we've recovered a bit."
"115740052-0-12534";"Good, good. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-12535";"Rilis has ruled here for centuries. How has that warped, twisted our souls?"
"115740052-0-12536";"Stop with your whining. It's my destiny to claim my birthright!"
"115740052-0-12537";"Your quest ends here, bastard."
"115740052-0-12538";"Damn my ancestors. Help! Protect me!"
"115740052-0-12541";"Pathetic mortal. You'll never stop the Mistress."
"115740052-0-12545";"We're almost there. I can feel the power in the air."
"115740052-0-12549";"There! The helm! And it's mine. All mine."
"115740052-0-12550";"Fool! The helm is meant for kings, not misbegotten bastards."
"115740052-0-12551";"The Great Hall is barred at the entrance to the Frost Steps. There must be a trick to opening the gate. Dare I go further? Will I ever return?"
"115740052-0-12552";"I am! I am a Rilis!"
"115740052-0-12553";"Take it, then. And see what it means to be a Rilis."
"115740052-0-12554";"At last. My birthright!"
"115740052-0-12556";"So there are draugr in this Keep as well. How long has the Keep been in disuse?\n\nToday keeps getting better and better."
"115740052-0-12557";"Stand back. And behold the scion of Castle Rilis!"
"115740052-0-12558";"I've traveled here for naught. The gate to the crypt is locked, probably opened by the pair of pressure plates here. And me with no companion.\n\nWithout the Torch, I can't light the Flame. Regrettable, but I'll return. I've yet to explore the summit."
"115740052-0-12559";"What? What's happening to me?"
"115740052-0-12562";"Come on, then! I'll bury you in the sand!"
"115740052-0-12565";"What's happening to me? Help me! Help! I am. A Rilis!"
"115740052-0-12566";"We warned you. Tried to stop you."
"115740052-0-12567";"Only those with pure blood can master the helm."
"115740052-0-12568";"Welcome to the family. Slave."
"115740052-0-12569";"Not a slave! I'm a Rilis! I'm one of you!"
"115740052-0-12571";"Would you like a drink?"
"115740052-0-12572";"I'm sworn to carry your burden."
"115740052-0-12573";"I pose to you, scale-scholar: what is the Hist?"
"115740052-0-12574";"The trees themselves, of course. The ground beneath our feet? The water that flows down the river? The breath of a new eggling?"
"115740052-0-12575";"All are correct. The Hist flows from the sap to our veins, and connects everything in between."
"115740052-0-12576";"Mother. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-12578";"I'll wait for you. Get back here as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-12579";"Here it is. Cower before the Rod of Kravari!"
"115740052-0-12582";"You're tougher than I thought, but let's see how you handle this."
"115740052-0-12586";"By order of High Kinsman Rilis the twelfth, begone from this place!"
"115740052-0-12587";"Sorondil! I'll spill your blood!"
"115740052-0-12588";"Who disturbs my slumber?"
"115740052-0-12589";"Cur! I will show you why Rilis chose me to be captain!"
"115740052-0-12590";"Intruders? Here?"
"115740052-0-12591";"Trespassers will be pursued, beaten, and sent to Oblivion."
"115740052-0-12592";"This is a test SAT for Alexis."
"115740052-0-12594";"We are starting to leave the area where I know there are Werewolves. Let's turn back."
"115740052-0-12595";"I am going to return to the Sergeant. My orders don't allow me to tarry."
"115740052-0-12596";"That's the last of them. Let's get back to the vault entrance."
"115740052-0-12598";"Let me show you my disappearing knife trick. The trick is that it disappears into your eye socket! Ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-12599";"Why aren't you laughing? Don't you get the joke? My death is my masterpiece."
"115740052-0-12600";"These Lights of Meridia can free me from Molag Bal's bondage. Find them and bring them to me."
"115740052-0-12601";"Ah, you've returned! And with the stone fragments in hand!"
"115740052-0-12602";"Ayrenn's spy is here!"
"115740052-0-12603";"Dispose of that pest!"
"115740052-0-12604";"Looks harmless, right? Wait, what's that tingling?"
"115740052-0-12605";"Brother, no!"
"115740052-0-12606";"Is that …?"
"115740052-0-12607";"<<1>>!"
"115740052-0-12609";"Cat, I warn you. Leave before someone dies."
"115740052-0-12610";"Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-12611";"We're leaving, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-12613";"Beyond this door lies the Ancestral Chamber at the very heart of Tanzelwil. If I complete the ritual and receive the ancestors' blessing, the people will finally accept me as King Tamlien's heir."
"115740052-0-12614";"I have a big nose."
"115740052-0-12615";"My cat's breath smells like cat food."
"115740052-0-12616";"Flyin', flyyin' in the sky,  cliff racer flies so high, flyinnn'"
"115740052-0-12617";"Flyin', flyyin' in the sky,  cliff racer flies so high, flyinnn'"
"115740052-0-12618";"Flyin', flyyin' in the sky,  cliff racer flies so high, flyinnn'"
"115740052-0-12619";"This is a fort, not a summer camp. Stand guard like an attack could happen at any time. Understand?"
"115740052-0-12620";"Yes, Lieutenant!"
"115740052-0-12621";"Show me your swing. Put your arm into it!"
"115740052-0-12622";"Good. Keep practicing. You might turn into a soldier yet."
"115740052-0-12623";"I told you, Xohaneel. We will not aid the outsider while our factions continue to argue about the fate of our beloved Hist tree."
"115740052-0-12624";"I'm not spending another minute in this camp! Thank you, friend!"
"115740052-0-12625";"How entertaining! An elegant kill."
"115740052-0-12626";"Is this working? Can you see me? I'll try to show you what's going on inside the library while you smash those lenses. Here goes …."
"115740052-0-12627";"Did you see that? I'll make some adjustments while you search for the next lens."
"115740052-0-12628";"Drink up! The only thing keeping you from becoming a shriven is my Special Blend!"
"115740052-0-12629";"It's working! I switched the widgets with the gadgets and that seemed to do the trick. Now let's see if I can get a view into the other part of the library …."
"115740052-0-12631";"Lady Laurent, we need to get out of here. This place is a trap. Young Raynor has already been caught in its spell."
"115740052-0-12632";"All right, I think I made the proper adjustments. Now let's see if I can spot my brother …."
"115740052-0-12633";"Oh, Telenger, let's just stay here. You and I. Forever."
"115740052-0-12634";"No, the glamour has taken you as well!"
"115740052-0-12635";"Come, my dear. Let us find a quiet corner among all these beautiful books."
"115740052-0-12636";"She's lost. Damn! I need to escape before I also succumb to the spell. I'll leave them a note in case the effects wear off."
"115740052-0-12637";"Time for a different approach."
"115740052-0-12638";"Awaken, my darling! I need you to wake and smash this rabble to pieces!"
"115740052-0-12639";"A spell? Why haven't I been affected? Wait, I just heard the door unlock! It should be safe now. Come meet me in the gallery at the top of the ruins."
"115740052-0-12640";"That was … unexpected. I must be doing something wrong. I'll give it one more try while you hunt down the last lens."
"115740052-0-12641";"This is Line 1 of Conversation 1."
"115740052-0-12643";"This is Line 3 of Conversation 1."
"115740052-0-12644";"This is Line 1 of Conversation 2."
"115740052-0-12645";"This is Line 2 of Conversation 2."
"115740052-0-12646";"This is Line 3 of Conversation 2."
"115740052-0-12647";"This is Line 1 of Conversation 3."
"115740052-0-12648";"This is Line 2 of Conversation 3."
"115740052-0-12649";"This is Line 3 of Conversation 3."
"115740052-0-12650";"This is Line 1 of Conversation 4."
"115740052-0-12651";"This is Line 2 of Conversation 4."
"115740052-0-12652";"This is Line 3 of Conversation 4."
"115740052-0-12653";"Hey! What are you doing? Are you mad?"
"115740052-0-12654";"Proctor, are you still heading to Velyn Harbor?"
"115740052-0-12655";"Indeed I am. You can accompany me, if you wish."
"115740052-0-12656";"The same goes for the rest of you. You lot are lucky we rescued you, if I do say so myself. There's no telling what the Imperials would have done to you, otherwise. Mercy is in short supply on both sides of this war."
"115740052-0-12657";"I'll take that as a compliment. Follow me and I'll ensure we all get back safely. If you're up for a day-long walk."
"115740052-0-12658";"Thanks for your help, citizen. I hope we'll meet again, taking the fight to the Imperials."
"115740052-0-12659";"I convinced my brother to wear the helm, and then led the mob who killed him."
"115740052-0-12660";"Mother wore the helm after father died. We never found her body."
"115740052-0-12661";"I wore the helm at the Battle of Ten Maws. I slew my son with my bare hands."
"115740052-0-12662";"Uncle hid the helm from me for years. I ripped his throat out on my birthday."
"115740052-0-12663";"The helm is our power source. And our curse. Only a true son of Rilis can wear the helm. Now. Begone!"
"115740052-0-12664";"Thank the gods. I found you!"
"115740052-0-12665";"My husband was a fool to trust that witch."
"115740052-0-12666";"He wasn't the only one, ma'am."
"115740052-0-12667";"Queen Ayrenn herself was to travel through here! I spent months preparing!"
"115740052-0-12668";"I'm sure she'll reschedule once Dawnbreak is rebuilt."
"115740052-0-12669";"Rebuilt. Damn, Sinyon. He should have listened to me!"
"115740052-0-12672";"I can't believe this mess."
"115740052-0-12673";"Daedra in Auridon. Never would have thought I'd see the day."
"115740052-0-12674";"Wonder if we'll get a pay raise for this."
"115740052-0-12675";"Pff. I'm more worried about getting out of here alive."
"115740052-0-12676";"How's your granddaughter?"
"115740052-0-12684";"Shipped out to South Beacon with her patrol. My daughter is so happy she's somewhere nice and safe. Pah. Safe. No place is safe with the war."
"115740052-0-12685";"Eh. Calm down. Ciranya's a smart girl. She'll do your ancestors proud."
"115740052-0-12686";"What was the name of that girl at that bar a few years ago?"
"115740052-0-12687";"The barmaid? Eminie. That was almost fifty years ago, you old fool."
"115740052-0-12688";"What? No, no. Yeah, it was. She's worth remembering, though."
"115740052-0-12689";"What was it you were telling me the other day about those lizard people?"
"115740052-0-12690";"What? The Argonians? I heard an old sailor telling this story about these trees. Mist trees, I think he said. The lizards crawl down out of the trees when they're born, and they can't mate without the -"
"115740052-0-12691";"Oh just stop. That's ridiculous."
"115740052-0-12692";"Hey, don't you have a grandson in the service?"
"115740052-0-12693";"Stars yes. He's so proud, walks around with that ridiculous helm on all the time. Just got a missive from him, he made it through the North Beacon raid."
"115740052-0-12694";"Auri-El protect him. That must have been terrible."
"115740052-0-12698";"I am coming for you, dear heart!"
"115740052-0-12699";"Destroy that crystal over there. I'll take out the crystal by the door."
"115740052-0-12700";"Time to destroy this crystal and move on."
"115740052-0-12701";"Onward we go!"
"115740052-0-12702";"We failed."
"115740052-0-12703";"Hush, Qor. Just rest."
"115740052-0-12707";"No! Not again! Leave him be! Rulanir has suffered enough!"
"115740052-0-12708";"Be careful! They'll show you no mercy! They never show mercy …."
"115740052-0-12709";"Stop! You've done enough! Leave Faindor alone!"
"115740052-0-12710";"No! Please end this!"
"115740052-0-12711";"The registrar still won't see us. And our guar steaks are beginning to spoil in their carts."
"115740052-0-12712";"Damn these crowds! We're going to lose our entire shipment!"
"115740052-0-12713";"Thanks to this stranger you live, Erning. If we ever see you again, there will be no mercy."
"115740052-0-12714";"You won't! I'll never come back, I swear!"
"115740052-0-12715";"I don't remember the last time things were this hectic."
"115740052-0-12716";"Good riddance. I never want to see this spot again."
"115740052-0-12717";"Let me go! It was only a reconnaissance mission!"
"115740052-0-12718";"Make it stop! Why are you doing this?!"
"115740052-0-12719";"I'm telling you, it's perfect. Once we're in, nobody will care that we're Altmer. We just might make it through this war alive."
"115740052-0-12720";"Can you believe we have to register to enter the city?"
"115740052-0-12721";"I heard the Maulborn have spies in the city. Maybe that's what all the fuss is about."
"115740052-0-12722";"Don't worry. I'll be home soon. Be strong for mommy."
"115740052-0-12723";"Auri-El give me strength. Auri-El give me strength. Auri-El give me strength. Auri-El give me strength."
"115740052-0-12724";"How did I get here? I think I was trying to get back to someone. Hm? Oh yes, another drink, please."
"115740052-0-12725";"I'll feast upon your soul!"
"115740052-0-12726";"You're a fool to come down here!"
"115740052-0-12727";"I'll eat your soul!"
"115740052-0-12728";"[alarm sound]"
"115740052-0-12729";"After all your years of service? Why?"
"115740052-0-12730";"Thanks, friend. I'm getting out of here. You should too, before more of them show up!"
"115740052-0-12735";"Help! They're going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-12739";"And now I'm dead. At least I don't hurt anymore."
"115740052-0-12740";"Pascal's dreams are mine!"
"115740052-0-12741";"I overheard an Ordinator. She said that Magistrix Vox was behind the recent troubles."
"115740052-0-12742";"Magistrix Vox? I remember her. She was always so devoted to the Tribunal."
"115740052-0-12743";"Sometimes too much devotion can be worse than too little. You never know what drives someone to do evil."
"115740052-0-12744";"News from the Gorge has arrived. The Maulborn have been defeated."
"115740052-0-12745";"I'll order the merchant caravans to get back on the roads immediately."
"115740052-0-12746";"Are we sure that's a good idea? We can't be sure the threat is really over."
"115740052-0-12747";"You worry too much, Haladir. Send the caravans on their way."
"115740052-0-12748";"A horrifying sight! The residents of Direfrost Keep appear to have been fleeing, but now they're frozen in time, trapped in this icy tomb for all eternity."
"115740052-0-12749";"There you are!"
"115740052-0-12750";"And so the last champion falls. Interesting. Find me at the entrance to my watch to receive your … reward."
"115740052-0-12752";"The ""Transmute Fog"" spell turned out more useful than I thought. Would never have gotten through the last door without it."
"115740052-0-12753";"Ah ha! I found you!"
"115740052-0-12755";"You have accomplished the impossible! Now for your true reward. Prepare to face … me!"
"115740052-0-12757";"You have to wait your turn. The line forms to my left."
"115740052-0-12759";"Why do we have to wait out here? Our cargo is going to be ruined!"
"115740052-0-12760";"I've been looking for you."
"115740052-0-12763";"Hurry before one of those lumbering morons come back."
"115740052-0-12764";"Let me just grab a weapon before I go to meet Skordo at the rendezvous. Maybe I'll take out an ogrim or two on my way."
"115740052-0-12765";"You look troubled, soldier."
"115740052-0-12766";"When do you think we're going to strike this camp and move on?"
"115740052-0-12767";"You've got time to rest and recover. Don't waste it worrying."
"115740052-0-12768";"No! Not again! Please, free him! Free Anconath from this torment!"
"115740052-0-12769";"I don't give a damn what your cult wants. This is an Imperial mission."
"115740052-0-12770";"Careful, Siro. We wouldn't want the Tharns to think you were rude to their guests."
"115740052-0-12771";"Don't think you can threaten me. I've served the Empire loyally for twenty years. I've vacationed with the Tharns!"
"115740052-0-12772";"Yes, we're all very impressed."
"115740052-0-12773";"You listen, and you listen well. These Bosmer build walls. Powerful walls. Walls that will keep you safe while we expand our empire. We can't afford to waste them on this Planemeld nonsense your cultists keep babbling about."
"115740052-0-12774";"You don't understand its importance because you don't understand the Planemeld. Every soul we use in our ritual brings us closer to joining the realms together. You'll have all the walls you could want, then. Ebon-spired, unbreachable walls."
"115740052-0-12776";"You have to wait your turn, sera. The line forms to my left."
"115740052-0-12777";"You haven't heard the last of this!"
"115740052-0-12778";"I can't believe you selected someone other than my master. I'll try to make your death as painless as possible."
"115740052-0-12779";"After everything our master promised you, you do this to us?"
"115740052-0-12780";"You need to be alive. You have to be! I need you to help me."
"115740052-0-12781";"I … I didn't do it. I swear. He was like this when I found him."
"115740052-0-12782";"Enough looting for now. Get some carts, and start stacking them with bodies. They'll need them up at the fort."
"115740052-0-12783";"Bodies, huh? You want us to make some fresh ones?"
"115740052-0-12784";"You want to start a riot? Use the ones in the street, first."
"115740052-0-12786";"You! Deliver a message to <<1>>. The Mages Guild has everything we need for the ritual."
"115740052-0-12787";"I don't answer to you, necromancer. Find her yourself."
"115740052-0-12788";"You think anyone will notice if I add you to the pile? If you don't know, find someone who does!"
"115740052-0-12789";"Aren't you done fixing that yet?"
"115740052-0-12790";"I'll have it done right away, sera."
"115740052-0-12792";"You did it! Now follow me, quickly!"
"115740052-0-12793";"Come back! Don't leave me!"
"115740052-0-12794";"Somehow, I knew I'd find you here."
"115740052-0-12795";"We leave the wamasu in the heart of the Imperial aquifer."
"115740052-0-12796";"Won't it melt the columns that hold the streets up?"
"115740052-0-12797";"Eventually, yes. But for now it guards our escape route. Once the ritual completes, that's the only way the others will make it out of <<1>> alive."
"115740052-0-12798";"Help me push it into the water!"
"115740052-0-12799";"If I have to fix it myself, you'll end up pulling it!"
"115740052-0-12800";"Get a hold of yourself, Arakh! Ifriz isn't one of ours. He's the bastard that runs this place."
"115740052-0-12802";"You're being manipulated. Here's our roster. You won't find Ifriz on it."
"115740052-0-12803";"Let me see that! I'm sure I knew him. Didn't I?"
"115740052-0-12804";"We need to figure a way to get out of this Tower of Lies."
"115740052-0-12810";"I'm not going back with you. That life is over."
"115740052-0-12811";"Here—take this. Consider yourself fully paid. By your own laws, I'm a free woman."
"115740052-0-12812";"So, you've found yourself a champion, eh <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-12813";"Know this. If I see you again, we will not part under such … amicable terms."
"115740052-0-12814";"I knew I shouldn't have trusted you!"
"115740052-0-12815";"Don't be so dramatic. You've bread and shelter here, which is more than you had in High Rock."
"115740052-0-12816";"Oh, father. How could you do this to me?"
"115740052-0-12818";"I heard my name. What do you need?"
"115740052-0-12819";"Did I hear my name?"
"115740052-0-12820";"You can't keep us in here, Rarli! The guard has no right to keep us prisoners."
"115740052-0-12821";"By the Three, you whine like a spoiled child! The city is locked down for your own protection."
"115740052-0-12822";"My wife has disappeared, but the guards refuse to act!"
"115740052-0-12823";"How terrible! I heard Slips-Through-Fingers lost her egg-sister."
"115740052-0-12824";"We never should have left Eastmarch."
"115740052-0-12825";"Our protection? So we're just supposed to sit here and rot as the plague takes us? The House Guard are no better than the Maulborn!"
"115740052-0-12826";"Three runes to place and activate, but only one opens the door. Look around before you choose."
"115740052-0-12827";"Evil gathers beyond these doors."
"115740052-0-12828";"Long have we guarded this tomb, watching over the bones of the evil Sinmur. Enter, champion!"
"115740052-0-12829";"You have arrived. I shall guide you as I am able."
"115740052-0-12830";"Did you hear about the Serk? There is no cure!"
"115740052-0-12831";"I knew it! The Maulborn are as dangerous as the Covenant these days."
"115740052-0-12832";"Why do the guards allow them to camp so close to town? Bah! Worthless, the lot of them."
"115740052-0-12833";"Thanks! I'll make my way out of here."
"115740052-0-12834";"Your frozen souls will haunt this place forever!"
"115740052-0-12835";"You haven't won."
"115740052-0-12836";"I'm getting out of here. No more Kwama mining for me!"
"115740052-0-12838";"Step up, step up! The dockside frog races are about to begin!"
"115740052-0-12839";"And go!"
"115740052-0-12840";"We have a winner!"
"115740052-0-12841";"You cannot run from us, flesh-thing. Everywhere you go, we are there."
"115740052-0-12842";"And I said this would be fun. Let's get out of here, Come on!"
"115740052-0-12843";"You seek to free us with the Attunement Stone? Don't bother. We don't covet freedom. We covet your flesh."
"115740052-0-12844";"And we will have it. Grind your skin and bones between the rocks to take your nourishment."
"115740052-0-12845";"The Elf-things rooted us here. So we ended them, consumed them."
"115740052-0-12846";"Apologies, flesh-thing. Sirdor is long dead. We took his form to bring you here."
"115740052-0-12848";"You delay the inevitable."
"115740052-0-12849";"What don't you understand? No free fish!"
"115740052-0-12850";"Once the pirates are out of <<1>>, I'll pay you double … no, triple! Triple for each fish!"
"115740052-0-12851";"You've never fed me when I fell on hard times. If you want fish, catch them yourself."
"115740052-0-12852";"Death to the afflicted! Death to the followers of false gods!"
"115740052-0-12853";"What hope do you have, flesh-thing?"
"115740052-0-12854";"Halt!"
"115740052-0-12856";"Boy did you walk into the wrong house!"
"115740052-0-12857";"When I was young, I thought Mother didn't know anything. Now I wish I'd listened to her more."
"115740052-0-12858";"Mother would take us here, to remember our ancestors. Her father. I loved those visits."
"115740052-0-12859";"Have you ever wondered what's out there? What lies beyond? It's time I found out!"
"115740052-0-12860";"This land is so beautiful. I don't want to leave. I should have listened to Mother."
"115740052-0-12861";"I'm so scared. Mother?"
"115740052-0-12862";"The time is now. Seek me by the cliffs outside Davon's Watch. Hurry."
"115740052-0-12863";"The time is now. Seek me by the cliffs outside Daggerfall."
"115740052-0-12864";"The time is now. Seek me by the sea outside Vulkhel Guard. Hurry."
"115740052-0-12865";"This one is a prize of the Master. Now her mind is ours!"
"115740052-0-12866";"Ahh… there is no better sight than students, studying. Good thing, too, as there is a test tomorrow! Keep at it, and don't disappoint. You are on the cusp of greatness."
"115740052-0-12867";"You sought Sirdor's Attunement Stone? You seek to free us? Don't waste your energy. Here you will stay. Here, our roots will drink your blood."
"115740052-0-12868";"Alanwe! Wait!"
"115740052-0-12869";"Now we're in business! This is the one I was talking about, Elvira!"
"115740052-0-12870";"Alanwe. Do you have a moment? I was hoping to speak to you about a new lesson plan. But I think I may have a more pressing issue."
"115740052-0-12871";"I wanted to speak to you, as well—what's this I hear about you teaching advanced destruction? I want the students able to defend themselves in the backwoods of Tamriel, but I don't want them learning how to fight a war—or burning the school down."
"115740052-0-12872";"And yet you hired a war wizard—can this conversation wait? Your husband—"
"115740052-0-12873";"Nerien'eth? What is it?"
"115740052-0-12874";"The flame of faith has sputtered, and gone out."
"115740052-0-12875";"He thinks you and I are having an affair."
"115740052-0-12876";"An affair? With you?"
"115740052-0-12877";"The growth of hatred chokes the faithful. Burn away this taint."
"115740052-0-12878";"The touch of the Daedra has stained this site. Wash away the slime."
"115740052-0-12879";"Danger still looms at this site. Dispatch the interlopers."
"115740052-0-12880";"Please … hurry … my time is running out …."
"115740052-0-12881";"Your work is done, penitent. Go to the center of Torinaan. End this corruption."
"115740052-0-12882";"Any sign of those slavers?"
"115740052-0-12883";"No, they've been quiet on this side. Haven't made a move."
"115740052-0-12884";"Well, be ready. They're desperate in there."
"115740052-0-12885";"Do what you can there. Firsthold already burns beneath my gaze."
"115740052-0-12886";"I was just following orders!"
"115740052-0-12887";"For the Veil!"
"115740052-0-12888";"As you wish, mistress."
"115740052-0-12889";"By Sheor's beard … it's a massacre in here!"
"115740052-0-12890";"It is good work. If you want to make a stew, you must gut a few fish, no?"
"115740052-0-12891";"Now come! Let us undo this altar."
"115740052-0-12892";"This one still feels a magic presence. There must be another altar."
"115740052-0-12893";"So. Oraneth sold her soul completely. The Thalmor will not be happy with this."
"115740052-0-12894";"Bakkhara, look! Just as you feared - the ritual is complete. See how the darkness gathers?"
"115740052-0-12896";"Ah. We have company. We'll continue this later."
"115740052-0-12897";"No, damnit. It's getting on my nerves."
"115740052-0-12898";"It's quiet on the other side. Still nothing here?"
"115740052-0-12899";"Don't I know it. Somebody better do something soon."
"115740052-0-12900";"Deputy seemed pretty edgy. I think something is going to happen soon."
"115740052-0-12901";"Really? Didn't you say that the last time you came by?"
"115740052-0-12902";"I'm telling you, I think this is it. There's been some stranger around, offering to help. Things are going to happen."
"115740052-0-12903";"So when are they going to give us the word? I want to get those bastards."
"115740052-0-12904";"Do I look like the constable calls me in for planning? I just carry orders."
"115740052-0-12905";"All right, sorry. It's not your fault, I know."
"115740052-0-12906";"Mine, all mine …."
"115740052-0-12907";"No! Stay away!"
"115740052-0-12910";"An outsider with an offering. Curious."
"115740052-0-12911";"Where there is light, there is shadow."
"115740052-0-12912";"Alanwe, I don't think your husband enjoys my company."
"115740052-0-12913";"They say that when someone professes another's dislike for them, they really mean the opposite."
"115740052-0-12914";"He hisses at me when I walk past."
"115740052-0-12915";"Stop it."
"115740052-0-12916";"Report, guardsman."
"115740052-0-12917";"It's true! I don't know what you see in him. You realize in the grand scheme of your marriage—he's the one who wins?"
"115740052-0-12918";"The men say those slavers have yet to make a move."
"115740052-0-12919";"Keep checking. They surprised us once. I don't want it happening again."
"115740052-0-12920";"Faindor!"
"115740052-0-12921";"What?"
"115740052-0-12922";"How many times do I have to tell you not to rewrite Nerien'eth's texts? It's incredibly irritating. And insulting."
"115740052-0-12923";"His books are wrong. All of this is pointless conjecture. You lot should be paying me to fix his work. The incoming classes will benefit greatly from my edits."
"115740052-0-12924";"By the Empyrean Light! The Altmeri do not openly criticize their elders! Were you conceived by Orcs? What's wrong with you?"
"115740052-0-12925";"I might as well be an Orc, the way my parents shipped me off to you. But you know that, don't you, Alanwe? You're all such lovely Elves."
"115740052-0-12926";"I … apologize. Put the books back where you found them, and I shall leave it at that. You have talent, Faindor. Don't waste it showing off. If you think you can do better, prove it to us, when the time comes."
"115740052-0-12927";"Please, have you read this garbage? Your husband knows nothing about conjuration. What does he even teach here? What is his purpose? Besides paying for this building? He's an insult to your kind. Your kind meaning mages. All the mages. In the world."
"115740052-0-12928";"An unusual bargaining session, but I'd best go check my stock."
"115740052-0-12929";"Give me those shoes or I beat you to death and take them! Choose!"
"115740052-0-12930";"Do you think I'll give up this prize easily?"
"115740052-0-12931";"After I kill you, I'll make you my slave!"
"115740052-0-12932";"We won't let you condemn us!"
"115740052-0-12933";"I'll end our curse even it means your death!"
"115740052-0-12934";"Fool! Our strength is eternal! You can't defeat us!"
"115740052-0-12935";"You won't get past me! I won't die for those weaklings!"
"115740052-0-12939";"Where's Ganise? I have to find her!"
"115740052-0-12940";"Please wait! I have to talk to you!"
"115740052-0-12941";"I have to go back! Dolril is in trouble."
"115740052-0-12942";"Wait! We have to protect the Tear!"
"115740052-0-12943";"I'm going back for the Tear. Meet me at the monastery"
"115740052-0-12944";"Combine the juices and the spines just so!"
"115740052-0-12945";"Now, according to my previous notes, I need a small catalyst."
"115740052-0-12946";"Isn't it grand! Wait, what's that burning smell …."
"115740052-0-12948";"For pity's sake, get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-12949";"Then arise as Svari, Sage of the Companions of Fallowstone Hall!"
"115740052-0-12952";"Wait! What are you doing? What is happening?"
"115740052-0-12954";"Thank you. <<1>> has behaved quite erratically since his return."
"115740052-0-12955";"This should be far enough."
"115740052-0-12957";"It's easy for you to stay calm. Those merchants could lose a lot of coin … and lives!"
"115740052-0-12958";"Ha, run while you can. If you return to Silent Mire, we'll meet again."
"115740052-0-12959";"You fight like an animal! Good work. I'll meet you outside."
"115740052-0-12960";"Get …. Find …."
"115740052-0-12962";"Prepare yourself. Move your paws quickly."
"115740052-0-12963";"Now! Destroy the crystals!"
"115740052-0-12964";"Good. Now to examine … the body?"
"115740052-0-12965";"Yes. Whatever Oraneth unleashed here may be even stronger than she. Prepare yourselves."
"115740052-0-12967";"Everybody out! Oraneth would undo us all!"
"115740052-0-12970";"It's quiet out there …"
"115740052-0-12971";"Don't. You say it again, I'll kill you."
"115740052-0-12972";"Really? Squashed him flat?"
"115740052-0-12973";"Yep. The giant walked off with Dagimar's head between his toes. Bet that caused a blister after a mile or so."
"115740052-0-12974";"Figures they'd send you. Die, Goblin-lover!"
"115740052-0-12975";"Mistress Bakkhara, what are you doing? We must go!"
"115740052-0-12976";"No, you must go! Warn the Guild. Warn Tamriel! Quickly now - Bakkhara can't hold this forever."
"115740052-0-12977";"What in Oblivion was that?"
"115740052-0-12979";"Thank you! I'll try to make it back to Trelan."
"115740052-0-12981";"<<1>>! Thank the gods you're alive!"
"115740052-0-12982";"The fog has lifted, Vestige. The path before us has been revealed. It is both dark, and twisted. \n\nCome to the Harborage. We have an unexpected guest who demands your presence."
"115740052-0-12984";"… inherent fallacy. Clearly magic obtains its strength and form from nature, as proposed by …"
"115740052-0-12985";"Nonsense! Magic underlies and defines nature. Nature is merely the manifestation of the mundane aspect of magic."
"115740052-0-12986";"And the powers we employ in our spellcraft?"
"115740052-0-12987";"That's the arcane aspect of magic, the hidden elements we draw upon."
"115740052-0-12988";"Your mind works in amusing ways, Danir. Perhaps more research is needed."
"115740052-0-12989";"<<1>>! You're safe!"
"115740052-0-12990";"Yes, I'm fine, but you're not. Please sit down, rest."
"115740052-0-12992";"Have you put in at Vulkhel Guard recently?"
"115740052-0-12993";"I know! The tariffs are killing us. That witch of a watch captain is pocketing the money, mark my words."
"115740052-0-12994";"I heard she was arrested in some kind of scandal. The Green take her."
"115740052-0-12995";"A friend of mine is setting up a trading concern in Vulkwasten. He asked me what kind of meat Wood Elves like."
"115740052-0-12996";"Err. Uh. I'm going to say boar. And fish. We love fish."
"115740052-0-12997";"Okay. I'll let him know. I say you shortfolk are strange."
"115740052-0-12998";"When's the next time your people are heading to the mainland?"
"115740052-0-12999";"There's some kind of event in Dune coming up. I was hoping to put in at Velyn Harbor sometime next month."
"115740052-0-13000";"Ah. I feel that ache. The caravan overland is so tedious. Damn that river. If we could put in at Arenthia, think of the time we could save!"
"115740052-0-13001";"You're on your own today. I'm not going near those docks."
"115740052-0-13002";"Oh come now. Zombies in the water?"
"115740052-0-13003";"I saw one! Pale skin, dead eyes, clawing at my boat. I speared it and rowed back as fast as I could."
"115740052-0-13004";"That's nonsense. Zombies don't swim."
"115740052-0-13005";"Neither will you, if one grabs you."
"115740052-0-13006";"What a beautiful day for fishing! Get up, you lazy oaf."
"115740052-0-13007";"Did you hear? Thane Fjora was attacked by one of her councilors!"
"115740052-0-13008";"I bet it was Golun."
"115740052-0-13009";"Why him?"
"115740052-0-13010";"Oh? And what of the water zombies?"
"115740052-0-13011";"Now for the true test! I've tamed the most exotic and dangerous beasts from the dark corners of Tamriel to test these challengers!"
"115740052-0-13012";"They're gone. One of the Skald King's best uncovered Worm Cult on the docks. Wiped them out!"
"115740052-0-13013";"There were Worm Cultists? Here?"
"115740052-0-13014";"The first monstrosities—presented for your entertainment—come from the ashlands of Morrowind. These creatures laid waste to an entire village before I captured them!"
"115740052-0-13015";"And you thought I was crazy."
"115740052-0-13016";"He's got the shifty eyes. And his name sounds evil. Who names their kid Golun?"
"115740052-0-13017";"Without further ado, it is my great honor to present… a magically corrupted strain of Shalk. I call them… Incineration Beetles!"
"115740052-0-13018";"What a night! I can't believe what's going on around here. Soldiers all over."
"115740052-0-13019";"This is the Companions' fault. Never liked them hanging around town like that anyway."
"115740052-0-13020";"I don't know about that, but the Reachmen sure want something in that mine."
"115740052-0-13021";"Well, how do you like being part of the Pact now? They cleaned things up, eh?"
"115740052-0-13022";"What? Town's a mess, Sinmur's back, Fallowstone's overrun. Don't need friends like that."
"115740052-0-13023";"Come on, the Pact helped us out of a jam. I'm happy to have allies like that."
"115740052-0-13024";"Sergeant Aera was a Worm Cultist!"
"115740052-0-13025";"I don't believe it. Fjora said Aera saved her life. She's a hero!"
"115740052-0-13026";"Someone saw Aera run into the crypt."
"115740052-0-13027";"So what? I bet she was chasing Worm Cultists, killing the last of them."
"115740052-0-13028";"You're heading to Lost Prospect? Skip it."
"115740052-0-13029";"Why?"
"115740052-0-13030";"Nobody who goes there ever comes back. It's crawling with zombies."
"115740052-0-13031";"Bah, just rumors. If that was true, the Watch'd take care of it."
"115740052-0-13032";"The Watch has bigger problems. Like that giant. I'd avoid Lost Prospect, if I was you."
"115740052-0-13033";"You heard about Lost Prospect? I told you!"
"115740052-0-13034";"You told me what?"
"115740052-0-13035";"Viveka just got back from there. Killed a lich and lots of zombies!"
"115740052-0-13036";"Shor's Blood! What happened? How did she survive?"
"115740052-0-13037";"One of Jorunn's soldiers saved her. Killed the lich and the zombies too. Damn fine work!"
"115740052-0-13038";"It is a trap!"
"115740052-0-13039";"Aye, it's safer here, but I miss Fullhelm. And that hardass Ironhand."
"115740052-0-13040";"What about old Wandering Eye?"
"115740052-0-13041";"Ha! Thorulf was an odd duck for sure. He'd stare out that window for hours."
"115740052-0-13042";"Ugh! Creepy. And the way he looked at Mistress Hallfrida was just, well … obscene."
"115740052-0-13043";"Don't worry about Hallfrida. Any man lays a hand on her will get a dagger in his belly."
"115740052-0-13044";"Guldir! Wait 'til you hear. Thorulf was with the Worm Cult!"
"115740052-0-13045";"No! You're not serious. Is he dead?"
"115740052-0-13046";"He got away. Tricked the Thane into trying to kill himself. Old Ironhand's still alive, though."
"115740052-0-13047";"Thank Dibella! How was he saved?"
"115740052-0-13048";"The Skald King's bodyguard saved Ironhand and the whole fort, from an army of undead no less!"
"115740052-0-13049";"Guldir! Wait 'til you hear. Thorulf was with the Worm Cult!"
"115740052-0-13050";"No! Old Wandering Eye? Did they kill him?"
"115740052-0-13051";"The Thane's bodyguard got him. Bless them for that. But Old Ironhand's dead."
"115740052-0-13052";"No! What happened?"
"115740052-0-13053";"Thorulf tricked him into burning himself alive. Hallfrida's Thane now. If not for that bodyguard, they'd all be dead."
"115740052-0-13054";"Where are the Three when you need them most? Nowhere!"
"115740052-0-13055";"Keep your voice down, Belera. The Hands of Almalexia don't tolerate blasphemy."
"115740052-0-13056";"But we have to tolerate indifference? Where's the justice in that?"
"115740052-0-13058";"I heard the Reachmen are up in the mountains, and maybe at Fallowstone Hall too"
"115740052-0-13059";"Really? Then why is Vigrod here? Shouldn't he be at the Hall?"
"115740052-0-13060";"No idea. It's just a rumor. Like the one about Reachmen with trained bears up in the mountains."
"115740052-0-13061";"Did you hear about Fallowstone Hall? Vigrod and someone from the Pact took it back!"
"115740052-0-13062";"That's a relief. Don't know why Vigrod left the Hall in the first place."
"115740052-0-13063";"He's always looked after Shor's. Knowing Vigrod, he's taking the losses at the Hall pretty hard."
"115740052-0-13064";"This looks promising. Let's start searching!"
"115740052-0-13075";"These challengers are surpisingly fierce! But here's the real reason you've come today!"
"115740052-0-13076";"I give you the most dangerous creature the wastes of Alik'r have ever spawned!"
"115740052-0-13078";"Prepare yourself, combatants! Pray to your gods and make your peace. You face the Stinger!"
"115740052-0-13079";"What? Impossible? How did you win?"
"115740052-0-13081";"Please, help me!"
"115740052-0-13082";"From the volcanic island of Vvardenfell. A creature of fury that knows no mercy. The vicious … the cruel … the Troll King!"
"115740052-0-13083";"The door is there, to the west."
"115740052-0-13084";"I can't believe all this horrible talk about the Maulborn."
"115740052-0-13085";"They do seem to be completely devoted to their cause."
"115740052-0-13086";"Yes, but their cause is evil! What don't you understand about that?"
"115740052-0-13087";"The price you're asking is outrageous."
"115740052-0-13088";"Don't want to pay? That's fine, I'm sure I can find someone who'll meet my price over in Skywatch."
"115740052-0-13089";"The Green take you. I won't have those upland upstarts outselling me. Your price is met."
"115740052-0-13090";"This way!"
"115740052-0-13091";"So what do your people value? I'm thinking of seeking trading partners in Vulkwasten."
"115740052-0-13092";"Well. Don't bother with booze. Most Bosmer don't imbibe. Meat. They always need more meat."
"115740052-0-13093";"I sunk some coin into a farm a few years back. I'll have to speak with my man in Greenwater."
"115740052-0-13094";"The quality of the steel from Mathiisen is excellent. Have you seen the blades they're making up there?"
"115740052-0-13095";"Oh yes. I've got an in with the foreman. Getting some for a great price."
"115740052-0-13096";"Bah. Damn you tallies and your nepotism. I need a stepstool to get a fair deal around here."
"115740052-0-13097";"You no take mammoth!"
"115740052-0-13098";"I say, did you see that Khajiit scum near the temple grounds? Disgusting, letting a mongrel near the house of Auri-El."
"115740052-0-13099";"I quite agree. Too bad they put in the hunting ban. Our fathers had quite the time, eh?"
"115740052-0-13100";"Just so! And well put, sir, well put."
"115740052-0-13101";"The stink. That's the worst part."
"115740052-0-13102";"You know what, you're right. At first I thought those nasty little teeth were the worst part. But the smell! Ugh."
"115740052-0-13103";"Comes of eating all that meat. What normal folk could stomach—ugh. What normal folk could stomach a meat drink?"
"115740052-0-13104";"Why would you ever go to that horrible little backwater?"
"115740052-0-13105";"I'm telling you, the beasts of Shattered Grove come right up to you. Bears eat right out of your hand!"
"115740052-0-13106";"Amazing. Can't wait to try out the blade Father gave me. Good Mathiisen steel against bear-flesh!"
"115740052-0-13113";"Lyris, child. Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-13114";"Yes, Prophet. I'm fine. The Vestige freed my mind from the Daedra's control."
"115740052-0-13115";"Thank the Divines. Your loss would have thrown all into chaos."
"115740052-0-13116";"They won't take me again. Not alive, at least."
"115740052-0-13117";"Sorry, but I can't be caught or killed. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-13128";"Stop! You two—hold it right there!"
"115740052-0-13129";"The Reachmen talked of an ancient tomb down here, something about the Companions."
"115740052-0-13130";"I heard the shamans talk of ""Sinmur,"" some ancient creature, evil I'd guess."
"115740052-0-13131";"I need to get out of here. Those shamans are looking for some long-dead monster!"
"115740052-0-13133";"The shamans found a tomb deep in the mine. I'm not staying around to see what they're up to!"
"115740052-0-13134";"Dark powers gather ahead."
"115740052-0-13135";"Reach shamans seek Sinmur, an ancient foe of the Companions."
"115740052-0-13136";"I sense the spirit of Sinmur drawing near!"
"115740052-0-13137";"If Sinmur walks again, death and devastation will stalk the land!"
"115740052-0-13138";"We have a challenger! Let's welcome them to the party!"
"115740052-0-13139";"Who dares disturb the rest of <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-13141";"Awaken, thralls! Destroy these tomb robbers!"
"115740052-0-13142";"I am <<1>>! Meet your doom!"
"115740052-0-13144";"Fitting, only the gods can save you now!"
"115740052-0-13145";"I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-13146";"They've taken Tovisa and the rest into the mine!"
"115740052-0-13147";"Just a little bit further."
"115740052-0-13149";"It will be over soon."
"115740052-0-13150";"I can help."
"115740052-0-13151";"No, don't!"
"115740052-0-13154";"Damn! Discovered!"
"115740052-0-13155";"Now we'll see what the Mad God has in store. Be brave, adept."
"115740052-0-13159";"Ho, friend!"
"115740052-0-13160";"After you."
"115740052-0-13162";"No! No hit in face! Byz sweep!"
"115740052-0-13163";"By the Three, we will rebuild, dear. We will rebuild."
"115740052-0-13164";"The Dominion took everything from us. I'll kill them. I'll kill them all."
"115740052-0-13165";"I'll kill them. I'll kill them all."
"115740052-0-13166";"Get away from here! I don't want to be let out!"
"115740052-0-13167";"Mother! You left me …. I'm all alone."
"115740052-0-13168";"The other students, the other mages, they all hate me."
"115740052-0-13169";"You were the only one …."
"115740052-0-13170";"And now you're gone."
"115740052-0-13171";"Shalidor! Eyevea is lost … you're obsessed! Can you even hear me?"
"115740052-0-13172";"That island was as much my home as yours. My work, my legacy, locked away forever."
"115740052-0-13173";"I can't do this anymore. I've moved on, but you never will."
"115740052-0-13174";"Goodbye … you silly old man."
"115740052-0-13175";"Ulfie … my love? I swear I just heard you. Where did you go?"
"115740052-0-13176";"Let's see here …."
"115740052-0-13177";"It works! I knew it would, of course."
"115740052-0-13178";"Into the tunnel you go. Now to get that door open!"
"115740052-0-13179";"At long last—Bthzark! Come, we'll talk of our next move inside."
"115740052-0-13180";"A happy side effect of restoring the power is that I can get this door open for you. There! That should do it!"
"115740052-0-13181";"These writings could prove crucial to understanding the schematics."
"115740052-0-13182";"That should do it! Remember, we're looking for both the schematics for the device and the core that can power it!"
"115740052-0-13183";"My love. Must I wait forever?"
"115740052-0-13184";"Why won't you come to me, my love?"
"115740052-0-13185";"If you so much as squawk, I will fill you full of arrows."
"115740052-0-13187";"Byz go tell chief you want talk."
"115740052-0-13188";"One less Goblin to deal with."
"115740052-0-13189";"You dare steal from me? Krif voth ahkrin!"
"115740052-0-13190";"Ah. Korthor's awake."
"115740052-0-13191";"My priests will make quick work of you! Luft Dinokii!"
"115740052-0-13192";"The shadows move, adept. Watch yourself!"
"115740052-0-13193";"Wait! I don't wish to fight. Let us talk."
"115740052-0-13194";"Eyes to the sky! Another group!"
"115740052-0-13195";"Good luck!"
"115740052-0-13196";"Curse it, I know he left some money in here."
"115740052-0-13197";"Found it! Time to get drinking!"
"115740052-0-13198";"That fool better have saved some for me!"
"115740052-0-13199";"Congratulations. You've passed the first trial."
"115740052-0-13200";"To arms!"
"115740052-0-13201";"Yeah, they bested the finest sloths, drunkards, and fools we had to offer!"
"115740052-0-13202";"Adorable. Shall we give them a pendant?"
"115740052-0-13203";"I say, let's see how these soft skins fair against a real challenge!"
"115740052-0-13204";"Thank the Eight it's quiet today. Did you hear what happened to Dame Dabienne in Koeglin Village?"
"115740052-0-13205";"She said some stranger showed up and got her set loose. She was lucky. You don't find people like that every day."
"115740052-0-13207";"It's good to know the war hasn't taken all the heroes from this world. Gives me some hope we'll get through this."
"115740052-0-13208";"Enough of this! Now you shall die!"
"115740052-0-13209";"Stop!"
"115740052-0-13210";"An enchanted saddle-warmer? You're too generous, Sir Brice. I don't go riding often these days, but I do appreciate the gesture."
"115740052-0-13211";"Fools! You cannot stand against the might of Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-13212";"The Eye may be fragile. Please let me examine it."
"115740052-0-13213";"Cease your meddling, mortal. The Master has plans for the Redguard."
"115740052-0-13214";"You make it hard to resist your advances, but I don't want to rush into anything."
"115740052-0-13215";"Quite the little fighter. We're not done with you yet!"
"115740052-0-13216";"Indeed I would, Yarelion … if that were truly the case. I'm afraid you gentlemen will have to excuse me now."
"115740052-0-13217";"Hah! You're too late! I've found him. The Redguard is mine!"
"115740052-0-13218";"My master has plans for your pure soul, Merric. You should feel honored."
"115740052-0-13219";"Welcome to the fight, comrade. Claws out, and watch yourself!"
"115740052-0-13220";"More coming. Brace yourself!"
"115740052-0-13221";"What was that voice?"
"115740052-0-13222";"So does that mean you will consider my request for your hand?"
"115740052-0-13223";"Perhaps you should tell him the truth, Ilise. That you and I plan to sell the estate and elope to Summerset Isle!"
"115740052-0-13224";"I had an awful battle with some monsters over this way."
"115740052-0-13225";"Go on without me. I … uh … have to do something over here."
"115740052-0-13226";"Well, here we go. Please stay close!"
"115740052-0-13227";"Now let's see if this works. It sure stinks!"
"115740052-0-13228";"I found this in Skyrim, at the bottom of a lake."
"115740052-0-13229";"Here goes!"
"115740052-0-13230";"Is it working?"
"115740052-0-13231";"It took so long before I found Belarata. Well! Let's begin."
"115740052-0-13232";"What's that noise?"
"115740052-0-13233";"There it is! Good luck!"
"115740052-0-13234";"""Our fates through the years are tied. A lover's kiss? Not one denied."""
"115740052-0-13235";"""Our hearts awoke from blissful sleep, where battles break and maidens weep."""

"115740052-0-13241";"Come, she waits."
"115740052-0-13242";"A sword with a poem etched into it. Also, the name ""Belarata."""
"115740052-0-13243";"I'm off to Deepwoods! Wish me luck!"
"115740052-0-13244";"I'm his now! Beware when next we meet!"
"115740052-0-13245";"There's too much power! I can't contain it!"
"115740052-0-13246";"The Keep has been abandoned for ages, sealed by unyielding frost—the locals say that it is haunted. Despite this, I hope to reclaim my ancestral home.\n\nShould ill-fortune befall me, I have left these Speaking Stones behind to tell my tale."
"115740052-0-13247";"The Keep has been abandoned for a generation, its entrances sealed by decades of accumulated layers of ice.  The locals keep away, frightened by stories of a witch's curse on the Direfrost family."
"115740052-0-13248";"There is an undeniable presence here, and dread consumes me. Despite my fear, I cannot help but investigate. Should ill-fortune befall me and I do not survive, I have left these Speaking Stones behind to tell my tale. I will start in the Main Hall."
"115740052-0-13249";"It looks clear now! Hurry. Meet me back at the manse!"
"115740052-0-13250";"By the Green, I could use a drink. Smell that fresh brew!"
"115740052-0-13251";"Stendarr. My head!"
"115740052-0-13252";"Giant snakes? Ahhh!"
"115740052-0-13253";"Here they come!"
"115740052-0-13256";"Is… is this the way out?"
"115740052-0-13257";"Netches are worse than kwama! Oh, what have I done?"
"115740052-0-13258";"Hold a moment. We should speak."
"115740052-0-13259";"Everyone! Gather around the fire. Our visitor has introduced me to a new delicacy. This one thinks it will be a most fragrant experience."
"115740052-0-13260";"This door bears a threefold seal. All of the runes must be found and activated to open it."
"115740052-0-13261";"Ysanne, why are you here? I don't think gawking at that knight is such a good idea."
"115740052-0-13262";"What do you mean, not a good idea? You expect me to show pity for someone who's working with slavers?"
"115740052-0-13263";"You really believe that? She's a Knight of the Flame. There's no way she was working with the slavers."
"115740052-0-13264";"Then why'd the constable have her locked up? You don't have an answer for that, do you?"
"115740052-0-13265";"I don't understand the constable's reasoning, but I have enough sense to realize that something's not right here."
"115740052-0-13266";"Do you still seek to free us with Sirdor's Stone? We already told you—we don't need your kindness. It comes ages too late. And if you think we won't flay you when we're free—we believe sharp laughter is the way your kind would respond."
"115740052-0-13267";"This is … unpleasant. Our mind feels … pulled apart …."
"115740052-0-13268";"This light … reminds us of the sun."
"115740052-0-13269";"You will die as Sirdor did, and we will drink you, as well."
"115740052-0-13270";"I have returned, my love!"
"115740052-0-13271";"<<1>>, we've got a new ally here!"
"115740052-0-13272";"My love? I cannot … your sword! Where is …."
"115740052-0-13273";"A pure soul, Doshia. Don't fail me."
"115740052-0-13274";"Kyne, give me strength."
"115740052-0-13275";"Agh. Aaaaaaaagh!"
"115740052-0-13276";"I can't wait to see my family."
"115740052-0-13277";"Noooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!"
"115740052-0-13278";"You lied? Stay away from me!"
"115740052-0-13279";"You are tired! Let me come closer!"
"115740052-0-13280";"You are not <<1>>! Get back!"
"115740052-0-13281";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-13282";"My friend, no! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-13283";"My head! I need a moment."
"115740052-0-13284";"B'vek, I'll have my revenge."
"115740052-0-13285";"Your revenge, your silk was worthless. Mine was the finest quality."
"115740052-0-13286";"Did an Ashlander tell you that?"
"115740052-0-13287";"I hate your face!"
"115740052-0-13288";"<<1>>, at long last I return!"
"115740052-0-13289";"<<1>>! You have been gone only a day, but it feels like an age."
"115740052-0-13290";"Yes, true. But you … where have you been?"
"115740052-0-13291";"Each day is an age without you."
"115740052-0-13292";"It is a long story, but come! Aetherius awaits!"
"115740052-0-13293";"Yes, together forever, as was always meant to be."
"115740052-0-13294";"So long, my friend, and thank you. For everything!"
"115740052-0-13295";"Ha! Durak. You say we betrayed you, but the Spirit Wardens and the Midnight Union were never allies."
"115740052-0-13296";"Indeed. We serve two very different mistresses. Our dream is your nightmare. Welcome to the new world, Abbot!"
"115740052-0-13297";"How's he doing?"
"115740052-0-13298";"He'll live, but he won't be swinging a sword anytime soon."
"115740052-0-13299";"Stay with him. We may need to move fast if they attack again."
"115740052-0-13300";"You never forget that smell. A Dragon Priest's tomb."
"115740052-0-13301";"A frost barrier. Look for a way to bring it down."
"115740052-0-13302";"Worthless!"
"115740052-0-13303";"Now, let's see if I can dislodge this."
"115740052-0-13304";"Something's … happening."
"115740052-0-13308";"This doesn't seem right …."
"115740052-0-13309";"Ahh, my favorite mortal. Shalidor finally figured out how to let you in. You're here to kick me out, I know. But fighting isn't really my thing. Haskill?"
"115740052-0-13310";"Very good, sir. Ahem. Have at you, adept. We will now face each other in honorable combat. On your guard."
"115740052-0-13312";"Just remember to point the wand away from you, dearie!"
"115740052-0-13313";"Where's my catalog? I must document my finds!"
"115740052-0-13315";"All right, that's enough. Break it up you two!"
"115740052-0-13316";"Let's move."
"115740052-0-13317";"Look, pup, someone to play with you!"
"115740052-0-13318";"Puppy doesn't like you, does he?"
"115740052-0-13327";"You don't want this war, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-13328";"This should let you talk to the Drublog without bloodshed."
"115740052-0-13329";"Fresh meat for The Crucible, eh?"
"115740052-0-13330";"Let's feed 'em to the Durzog!"
"115740052-0-13331";"Good idea. Get 'em boys!"
"115740052-0-13332";"Hmph. I guess that'll do. Open the gates!"
"115740052-0-13333";"What madness is this, restless spirits? Why have you left the sanctity of the Coiled Path?"
"115740052-0-13334";"Be calm, spirits. Trust in the wisdom of the Ghost Snake."
"115740052-0-13335";"How are the house repairs going?"
"115740052-0-13336";"Slow. I was having new mortar shipped in, but the constable won't let them unload the cargo from the ship."
"115740052-0-13337";"Strange days. The slavers, the ship, and now this knight in the stocks … our peaceful village isn't so peaceful any more."
"115740052-0-13338";"Easy, just put the sword down."
"115740052-0-13339";"Quiet! How many more of you are there?"
"115740052-0-13340";"You're Veiled Heritance, aren't you? I should ask you the same thing."
"115740052-0-13341";"Oh this is an easy one!"
"115740052-0-13342";"Over here! Untie Khajiit!"
"115740052-0-13343";"Piss off!"
"115740052-0-13344";"Another outsider! But this one … I have seen this one in my visions. We must speak."
"115740052-0-13345";"This is an outrage! I want to speak to the man in charge of this tribe, you crazy woman!"
"115740052-0-13346";"Everyone, stay back! No one's getting on or off that ship until further notice."
"115740052-0-13347";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-13348";"That look on your face was amazing!"
"115740052-0-13349";"Did you get it? Did your invitation arrive?"
"115740052-0-13350";"Rub it in, why don't you? If you must know, Shad Astula has rejected me. Again."
"115740052-0-13351";"Nonsense. I'm sure it's just a clerical error. You'll be in the Academy next season, for sure!"
"115740052-0-13352";"New challengers appear from the cold wastes. Are they worthy enough to face The Pack? Let the games begin!"
"115740052-0-13354";"Go back to your homes. You'll be much safer there."
"115740052-0-13355";"Impressive. Let's see if they can handle something a little harder, eh?"
"115740052-0-13356";"The Green Lady is mine by right. I have captured the Silvenar. She must yield to me."
"115740052-0-13357";"Are you hurt, Elf?"
"115740052-0-13358";"<<1>>! Stay back!"
"115740052-0-13359";"Though I am in Silvenar's city, I have power. Chieftain, cut them down!"
"115740052-0-13360";"I warned you, <<1>>! You chose to stand against your people!"
"115740052-0-13361";"No! Brother! Stay your hand!"
"115740052-0-13362";"Go! See where they have gone. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-13363";"I'm sure we'll have the situation resolved soon. Until then, you'll have be to be patient."
"115740052-0-13364";"My daughter! This is not loyalty. You're this hound's pet!"
"115740052-0-13365";"<<1>>. You have much to answer for."
"115740052-0-13366";"I leave <<1>> to you, <<2>>."
"115740052-0-13367";"The Hound … I know who he truly is. It does not bode well."
"115740052-0-13368";"Stay beside me, friends. We face the cult together!"
"115740052-0-13369";"Kyne's Breath. Can it be? The Five Hundred Companions?"
"115740052-0-13370";"Sinmur is dead. You have won a great victory this day!"
"115740052-0-13371";"Rise Jorunn, Skald King. Rise and greet me as the true champion of the north."
"115740052-0-13372";"You have united not just the Nords. The ancient Elves and the crafty lizard folk stand with us as well."
"115740052-0-13373";"Your champions! We've met. A hard road lies ahead of you. But for now, savor this victory."
"115740052-0-13374";"Companions! Three cheers for the Skald King and his brave champions! Wormcrushers and giantslayers!"
"115740052-0-13375";"Again!"
"115740052-0-13376";"Once more!"
"115740052-0-13379";"For the Pact and the north!"
"115740052-0-13380";"Ysgramor! I am not worthy."
"115740052-0-13381";"I had help, my liege."
"115740052-0-13382";"Thank you, Ysgramor!"
"115740052-0-13385";"Companions! We ride to Sovngarde!"
"115740052-0-13386";"Yes. Let's get you inside, dear. This has been a difficult day. But I'm here now."
"115740052-0-13387";"I … I think I need to lie down for a moment."
"115740052-0-13388";"Get away from my things!"
"115740052-0-13389";"Not so fast there, Shalidor. Only invited guests at the Chateau. We have standards, you know."
"115740052-0-13390";"Damn you, Mad God!"
"115740052-0-13391";"Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Shally."
"115740052-0-13392";"Annnd … off you go!"
"115740052-0-13393";"Just the two of us. Now we can talk in peace."
"115740052-0-13395";"It looks as like there's some fight in our challengers, after all. Take them down!"
"115740052-0-13396";"Gahhh!"
"115740052-0-13398";"I've known this clan for years. We've never been allies, but this hostility is unexpected."
"115740052-0-13399";"This one thanks you, stranger. Please, come to meet in the storehouse!"
"115740052-0-13400";"Thanks to you, young one. I will find my own escape now."
"115740052-0-13401";"You fight well! Thank you for freeing me, friend!"
"115740052-0-13402";"Haskill? Oh, Haskill! Show them what the Wabbajack can do!"
"115740052-0-13403";"The pigs, Haskill! Toss those huggable, squeezeable piglets!"
"115740052-0-13404";"Now you've gone and done it. I've never seen Haskill so angry! At someone else, I mean."
"115740052-0-13405";"Be wary. Talk to these ""guests"" carefully before you try to throw anyone out."
"115740052-0-13406";"I can hear you, Shally! Don't bother my guests!"
"115740052-0-13407";"You're the only one that thinks you're funny, Mad God!"
"115740052-0-13408";"Only two more to go. This trial is child's play."
"115740052-0-13409";"I'm going to bind you to haunt a little old lady in Wayrest! Does that sound fun, Shally?"
"115740052-0-13410";"Hardly."
"115740052-0-13411";"Those poor souls. Sheogorath's ""family."""
"115740052-0-13412";"How do you keep getting back in here? I blame Haskill."
"115740052-0-13413";"Apparently, not everything is under your control!"
"115740052-0-13414";"Not yet, anyway."
"115740052-0-13415";"So much for Uncle Leo."
"115740052-0-13417";"Why do you disturb me?"
"115740052-0-13418";"She's gone. You're too late."
"115740052-0-13419";"… as our agreement stipulates, ""By fire and sword."""
"115740052-0-13420";"Drublog do not slaughter those who keep us fat with plunder!"
"115740052-0-13421";"<<1>> insists Velyn Harbor must burn."
"115740052-0-13422";"Tell your ""Captain"" my decision stands!"
"115740052-0-13423";"Back inside, you s'wit."
"115740052-0-13424";"Intruders! Over here!"
"115740052-0-13425";"The constable says be ready.  He's got a plan."
"115740052-0-13427";"Of course, of course. Care to join me? Oh, never mind. I'm going."
"115740052-0-13428";"He won't be pleased."
"115740052-0-13429";"Ha! Then he will meet my fist and those of my people!"
"115740052-0-13430";"Leave me, dog! I've heard enough barking."
"115740052-0-13431";"There they are! Get 'em!"
"115740052-0-13432";"I made it! Did you miss me? Find anything exciting before I got here?"
"115740052-0-13433";"Hey, handsome! Did you send this fine bottle of wine to little old me?"
"115740052-0-13434";"What? Are you talking to me?"
"115740052-0-13435";"No, I'm talking to the other good-looking House Dres guy over there. Look, if you didn't send this to me, just say so and I'll show my gratitude to somebody else."
"115740052-0-13436";"Well, I'm the only House Dres courier who delivers wine in Mournhold, so that bottle must have come from my supply. And it certainly looks good next to you. You mentioned gratitude. How thankful exactly are you thinking?"
"115740052-0-13437";"Why don't you come upstairs and find out? Someone has to help me drink this wine."
"115740052-0-13438";"Good. You've arrived."
"115740052-0-13439";"Kneel down, lover. Let's have some fun."
"115740052-0-13440";"Well, that was fun! Hey! Didn't you see my signal? Go get the key!"
"115740052-0-13444";"Don't worry. You won't see me again if I can help it."
"115740052-0-13445";"Wait, I—"
"115740052-0-13446";"This is an outrage! Let me speak to the man in charge of this tribe, you crazy woman!"
"115740052-0-13447";"This is madness! What kind of people are you? I demand to speak to the man in charge here!"
"115740052-0-13448";"Follow me."
"115740052-0-13449";"There are just a few of us left. I don't know how much longer we can hold."
"115740052-0-13450";"The Colovians were at our doorstep. Ask Shazah about that. Now some of them are hiding within the fort."
"115740052-0-13451";"<<1>> is up here. Mind your feet."
"115740052-0-13452";"Welcome one and all to the Frozen Arena! The site for today's grand melee! The winner of this contest will face the most feared  collection of monsters in all of Tamriel! Without further ado, begin the melee!"
"115740052-0-13453";"About time you got here. What took you so long?"
"115740052-0-13454";"Come on. Let's see what's down here."
"115740052-0-13455";"No, this can't be right. Damn it! These tunnels were supposed to be sealed off. Well, into the fire and all that. Follow me."
"115740052-0-13456";"The Nords have been sent packing, to their Halls of the Dead!"
"115740052-0-13457";"And there go the Altmer! High Elves, laid low!"
"115740052-0-13458";"These Dunmer will never again know the wonders of Morrowind!"
"115740052-0-13459";"The Argonians should feel right at home, face down in the mud!"
"115740052-0-13460";"No time to lick their wounds. The Khajiit are defeated!"
"115740052-0-13461";"And there we have it! The winners of the Grand Melee!"
"115740052-0-13462";"What? No! How did you find those clothes? I hid them so well!"
"115740052-0-13463";"I would have chosen otherwise."
"115740052-0-13465";"You conniving little witch! This was my idea!"
"115740052-0-13466";"Alits? Really? Search around. There should be a door somewhere nearby. I'll keep an eye out."
"115740052-0-13467";"Let me guess. The door won't open? There's got to be something controlling it. Look around a bit. And watch out for those creatures. They're … ugly."
"115740052-0-13468";"You got past my men. Did Tharayya put you up to this? She's still out there, isn't she? Kill these fools."
"115740052-0-13469";"Pathetic! I'll have to do this myself!"
"115740052-0-13470";"Hmm. Just a moment. Aelif recognizes this set up."
"115740052-0-13471";"You must destroy the totems before the Hound comes. Quickly, now!"
"115740052-0-13472";"Yes! These crystals control access to the room ahead. Comrade, focus on that first crystal."
"115740052-0-13473";"By the Mace! It worked! Comrade, come to this crystal here. Merric, you focus on the one by the door."
"115740052-0-13474";"Sheogorath's ""Uncle"" is a Flesh Atronach. Why am I not surprised?"
"115740052-0-13475";"I've got it!"
"115740052-0-13476";"I hate to say it, but I told you so. You should've listened to me."
"115740052-0-13477";"That's it! Merric, you hold that beam. Aelif will use the last crystal to open the door. We are almost there."
"115740052-0-13478";"I wouldn't say it too loud if I were you. There's another set of stocks right there next to the constable."
"115740052-0-13479";"I don't care if the constable was brainwashed by some cult. I still say there's something suspicious about that woman."
"115740052-0-13480";"Well. You aren't at all what I was expecting."
"115740052-0-13481";"Let's talk."
"115740052-0-13482";"Just one more beam and we are through this door!"
"115740052-0-13483";"This is going to be so much fun!"
"115740052-0-13484";"Our army moves on Carzog's!"
"115740052-0-13487";"Success! Let's go. Sees-All-Colors must be close."
"115740052-0-13488";"Feels like the old days, Aelif. Let's get this done!"
"115740052-0-13489";"Commander <<1>>, what's wrong?"
"115740052-0-13490";"The Bloodthorns have raised a spectral army from the depths of the ruins. We can't defeat them!"
"115740052-0-13491";"Get the wounded back to the fortress. We'll put an end to this!"
"115740052-0-13492";"Remember, you can take clothes from hampers or off dead Sea Drakes."
"115740052-0-13493";"Oh, and try not to get killed."
"115740052-0-13498";"Wait, you're not my … what have you … did you poison me?"
"115740052-0-13499";"I'll gut you like a stuck pig … cut your eyes out … roast you …."
"115740052-0-13500";"Urk …."
"115740052-0-13501";"Oh, my, captain, are you feeling okay?"
"115740052-0-13502";"Like you did my crew? No, that won't happen again."
"115740052-0-13503";"Aw. She fell down."
"115740052-0-13504";"You first."
"115740052-0-13505";"I owe you for this. Thanks. Now, let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-13506";"They store everything on the upper level."
"115740052-0-13507";"What's happening, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-13508";"Neramo! Glad you're here. What did you find out?"
"115740052-0-13509";"Stay away from Helane. She's a monster!"
"115740052-0-13510";"These Sea Drakes give pirates a bad name. Kill every last one of them you see!"
"115740052-0-13511";"Word of advice. Don't let them capture you. If you can't get away, die fighting."
"115740052-0-13512";"Captain Lerisa never leaves anyone behind. Make sure she's safe."
"115740052-0-13513";"Good. Now to collect four more."
"115740052-0-13514";"Rashomta's statue will be marked with the spider seal."
"115740052-0-13515";"Sahdina's statue should have the scorpion seal at its base."
"115740052-0-13516";"The cultists have somehow sealed the doors with the welkynd stones."
"115740052-0-13517";"Find a way into the ruins."
"115740052-0-13518";"I need to find Kaleen!"
"115740052-0-13519";"There is another woman. You can't compare to her. It's over."
"115740052-0-13520";"Oh, Hosni! How can you be so cruel?"
"115740052-0-13521";"Cruel? Now that I see you clearly, it's a wonder I'm so lenient. Begone."
"115740052-0-13522";"You took on Daedra! Are you crazy?"
"115740052-0-13523";"Wait'll I tell the others! They'll never believe it!"
"115740052-0-13524";"Well done! Let's head to the central tree. There, I can force out the rest."
"115740052-0-13526";"Good job! I knew you could do it. Meet me inside."
"115740052-0-13527";"The staff is fully charged. Quickly, meet me at my tomb."
"115740052-0-13528";"It is done! Meet me at the west end of the graveyard."
"115740052-0-13529";"<<1>>, this bloodshed ends … with your death."
"115740052-0-13530";"The Drublog will pay in kind for this massacre! I will have their blood!"
"115740052-0-13531";"Z'en answers my prayers! The Drublog will finally pay!"
"115740052-0-13532";"What fool dares enter the lair of the Maulborn? Wait. We know you. Magistrix Vox will be pleased with us when we display your head on a pike!"
"115740052-0-13533";"Enough of this nonsense! I'll deal with you myself!"
"115740052-0-13534";"My city, my people, shall not be harmed!"
"115740052-0-13535";"The scent of Daedric magic permeates the air. Those who practice forbidden magic shall pay dearly for their crimes!"
"115740052-0-13536";"It seems I am in your debt again, champion. Your friend. She thinks to hide from me, but I heard her words of warning. She cares for you. But Farona is wounded. I shall take her to the Mages Guild where she can receive care. Find her there."
"115740052-0-13537";"The cult's leader entered that thing and didn't come out."
"115740052-0-13538";"I'm off. Don't get murdered."
"115740052-0-13539";"One moment, and I'll open this door for you."
"115740052-0-13540";"Let's go!"
"115740052-0-13541";"Stay … stay back. Attacking the … the city. Stay back!"
"115740052-0-13542";"These look valuable, don't they?"
"115740052-0-13546";"Technically, I've been banned from the Crucible, but they can't possibly turn away a group of fresh fighters,"
"115740052-0-13550";"I hate boats. All the rocking and back and forth and back and … by the Three! I think I'm going to be sick again!"
"115740052-0-13551";"I told you you shouldn't have eaten right before we … oh my, that's just gross!"
"115740052-0-13552";"Our friend looks more blue than usual."
"115740052-0-13553";"I hate you both so much right now."
"115740052-0-13554";"Ahh, it's good to be back! Guards, would you be so kind as to open the gates? I bring fresh fighters for the games!"
"115740052-0-13555";"No, no, hear me out. How many Tharns does it take to rule an Empire?"
"115740052-0-13556";"Would you shut up? I'm trying to work here."
"115740052-0-13557";"None. The one on the throne is a patsy and the one in the tower isn't useful anymore!"
"115740052-0-13558";"That's not even funny. Get back to work, would you?"
"115740052-0-13559";"What? It's true. Lord Mannimarco is going to peel his skin off and make a particularly ugly flesh atronach out of him, mark my words."
"115740052-0-13560";"And if you don't help me, I'll make sure you're sewn up right alongside him. Now shut up!"
"115740052-0-13561";"You ain't allowed in here, Talres. You know that."
"115740052-0-13562";"The crystals hum with power. Go to the center. You should find the key to Prince Maleel's tomb there."
"115740052-0-13563";"I brought you some new competitors! Surely, you can make an exception. Now, be a good lad and open the gates?"
"115740052-0-13565";"He sounds a bit upset, adept."
"115740052-0-13566";"I'll be the judge of it! Let's see if they've got the right stuff. Durzogs, attack!"
"115740052-0-13567";"I'd guess Haskill will be waiting outside. Let's go."
"115740052-0-13569";"You dare open my tomb? Come, then, and feel the scythe's blade!"
"115740052-0-13573";"Well, there's your answer. Now kindly open the gates; there's a good lad!"
"115740052-0-13574";"Walk this way."
"115740052-0-13575";"Watch that torch! I don't want to see our friend here with any new burn marks. You hear me, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-13577";"That's done it! Now we can push these monsters back!"
"115740052-0-13581";"Heh, the catmen love a good hallucination. I can't wait to see their faces!"
"115740052-0-13582";"A good scare will be good for those Wood Elves. Always taking things so seriously, ""Green Pact"" this and ""Green Pact"" that."
"115740052-0-13583";"won't budge."
"115740052-0-13584";"Let's get back to work!"
"115740052-0-13586";"Baan Dar's tail, what is this? This one has never seen such things!"
"115740052-0-13587";"If it isn't our old friend, Talres! I hope you've brought the money you owe us."
"115740052-0-13588";"Don't be ridiculous! Your man forfeited the match. I owe you nothing!"
"115740052-0-13589";"Lies! There was no forfeit. You lost, and now it's time to pay. Coin or flesh, the choice is yours."
"115740052-0-13590";"Now, now. Surely, we can come to some mutually beneficial arrangement …."
"115740052-0-13591";"Enough talk. Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-13592";"I am the Blessed Crucible! You are nothing!"
"115740052-0-13593";"Let my legend live on."
"115740052-0-13594";"When will they send me some worthy opponents?"
"115740052-0-13595";"Just remember. Laugh a little bit every day. It'll do you good."
"115740052-0-13596";"Well, that was rather unpleasant."
"115740052-0-13597";"This is where we part, my friends. I will see you inside. Speak to my giant friend here, to gain entrance."
"115740052-0-13598";"Over here."
"115740052-0-13599";"Why must <<1>> still consult with that apparition? May this be the last time I light those accursed candles."
"115740052-0-13600";"Hmph. What beast only talks through a ritual? I don't trust it."
"115740052-0-13601";"That red barrier is blocking the door. We'll need to turn it off somehow in order to get through."
"115740052-0-13603";"Hm, that was strange. Speak with me."
"115740052-0-13604";"See you when the dust settles. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-13605";"I… what was that? For a moment I thought I sensed something. Was it my sweet Risa?"
"115740052-0-13606";"Poor mother, my sorrow is great to have caused you pain. I wish you would not grieve any longer."
"115740052-0-13607";"Do you know what I've been through? Where've you been?"
"115740052-0-13608";"Be at peace, mother."
"115740052-0-13609";"No more moon-sugar candy. Feluz promises!"
"115740052-0-13610";"Hah! That'll be the day. My father warned me!"
"115740052-0-13613";"Excellent!"
"115740052-0-13615";"For the Lord of Brutality!"
"115740052-0-13616";"All I did was provoke a showdown that was coming anyway."
"115740052-0-13617";"You ready for anything?"
"115740052-0-13618";"All right then."
"115740052-0-13619";"Tell me, are those Redguards here to cause trouble? I'm so worried. My father lives outside the walls."
"115740052-0-13620";"Sorry. I was just asking."
"115740052-0-13622";"Well done. Now, to leave this place."
"115740052-0-13623";"Please. Speak with me."
"115740052-0-13624";"Hey! You hate each other! Remember?"
"115740052-0-13625";"Go, join the fracas! This is your cue. Action!"
"115740052-0-13626";"Employing dead Ayleids as the mechanism to unbar this door is actually quite clever."
"115740052-0-13627";"Oh yeah! Get em'!"
"115740052-0-13628";"I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-13629";"No matter. Come. Face me yourselves!"
"115740052-0-13630";"The Fork is mine! You shall not have it! Dir Nu!"
"115740052-0-13632";"Ahh … there you are."
"115740052-0-13633";"Splendid, splendid! But wait? Do I hear someone approaching?"
"115740052-0-13634";"Oh, it's simple my king. The Mages Guild caused this in-fighting. It's all their fault!"
"115740052-0-13635";"The Mages Guild? This mewling puppy? You want trouble? Here is trouble! For the Pact!"
"115740052-0-13636";"Over here. I have a question for you."
"115740052-0-13637";"What's the plan?"
"115740052-0-13638";"Vardan is in the spirit realm, beyond the portal. He has the relic, and we must get it!"
"115740052-0-13639";"We'll hold here, as long as it takes."
"115740052-0-13640";"This way."
"115740052-0-13641";"Use this to defeat them!"
"115740052-0-13642";"I'll meet you at the door."
"115740052-0-13643";"We don't abide cheaters in the Blessed Crucible! You're gonna pay for that!"
"115740052-0-13644";"No, Firwin!"
"115740052-0-13645";"It's still here. There must be a way to clear it!"
"115740052-0-13646";"What have you done? The pressure has grown too great! Now we have to start over."
"115740052-0-13647";"Mother? Mother!"
"115740052-0-13648";"That bastard!"
"115740052-0-13649";"That is one. Now let's head to the next site."
"115740052-0-13650";"We've done it, dearie! Follow me, it's time you were introduced to the Dance!"
"115740052-0-13651";"Only one remains."
"115740052-0-13652";"I hope we don't run into any werewolves again. I've had enough of those beasts."
"115740052-0-13653";"The archery range is just up this hill."
"115740052-0-13655";"Good luck, have fun!"
"115740052-0-13656";"Hurry! Take that to the hill. The first fires will be lit soon."
"115740052-0-13657";"This should seal Fort Grimwatch for now."
"115740052-0-13658";"So you decided the fate of the relic."
"115740052-0-13659";"Time for me to seek new adventures… farewell."
"115740052-0-13660";"Freedom at last! Where in Oblivion am I? Need to find some higher ground."
"115740052-0-13661";"The first Mane? Incredible!"
"115740052-0-13662";"My parent's graves. My mother died in childbirth."
"115740052-0-13663";"My father was distant. Cold. I think he blamed me for my mother's death."
"115740052-0-13664";"I ran off to become a mercenary when I was sixteen. I never saw my father again. He was murdered by an old enemy."
"115740052-0-13665";"Father? Papa, is that you?"
"115740052-0-13666";"Oh no! That must be them! Please—you have to protect me!"
"115740052-0-13667";"This should do nicely."
"115740052-0-13668";"Go! Kill the Lava Queen and end this. I'll hold off the guards!"
"115740052-0-13669";"This can't be! It … it looks like my childhood home in Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-13670";"Bleed, you bastard! Die like the monster you are!"
"115740052-0-13672";"I'll meet you outside."
"115740052-0-13678";"This … this can't be right!"
"115740052-0-13679";"Well played! Well played, indeed!"
"115740052-0-13680";"Never speak to me again."
"115740052-0-13681";"The Mages Guild cannot turn on the Dominion so easily. You are a part of this world, like it or not."
"115740052-0-13682";"Either you're with the Dominion or you're against us. You want to be removed from this world? Fine. I'll do it for you."
"115740052-0-13683";"Here, let me show you the path to exile!"
"115740052-0-13684";"You can't ignore the world around you!"
"115740052-0-13685";"Ah. Good catch, jester. Soldiers! Give this Mage the gift of exile."
"115740052-0-13687";"Champion of the Blessed Crucible, we salute you!"
"115740052-0-13688";"Her mind and soul are already ours! Abandon your pathetic rescue!"
"115740052-0-13689";"My Queen, you don't understand. The Guild does not belong to any alliance. We merely wish to study in peace and solitude."
"115740052-0-13690";"Hey! Quiet down front! I am trying to watch the queen's speech!"
"115740052-0-13691";"Hey, Queenie! You missed a mage! This one is a member of the guild, too."
"115740052-0-13692";"A collection of foolish thoughts, that. All to sell more books. Don't expect to find much truth in a tome such as that."
"115740052-0-13693";"Such impertinence! Razum-dar, Captain Odreth! Take care of this serf."
"115740052-0-13694";"You killed my favorite cat! Such a loyal pet."
"115740052-0-13696";"Looks like I'll have to handle this myself. You face Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri! In her full glory!"
"115740052-0-13700";"Fire! There's fire there!"
"115740052-0-13701";"Fire bad! Gah!"
"115740052-0-13702";"Helthar hide!"
"115740052-0-13703";"Smoke? Why does Helthar smell smoke?"
"115740052-0-13704";"Aiyee!"
"115740052-0-13705";"Everyone, we have a fresh barrel of Rotmeth here!"
"115740052-0-13706";"Careful, keep your head down."
"115740052-0-13707";"It's my old mercenary camp."
"115740052-0-13708";"Varen was our commander. We were fighting to free the empire from the yoke of the Longhouse Emperors."
"115740052-0-13709";"I tried to be a good soldier, but the rest of the unit … they treated me like a freak. I think they were afraid of me."
"115740052-0-13710";"They liked to hide my armor so I'd fail inspection. Bastards. In a camp full of people, I never felt so alone."
"115740052-0-13711";"No! What … what have you done? The deal has been broken. My … my child. What will become of my child?"
"115740052-0-13712";"Do you remember anything? Where you came from? Who you are?"
"115740052-0-13713";"My head is pounding. I think … I think my name is … Stefan …."
"115740052-0-13714";"Excellent. I'm ready."
"115740052-0-13715";"'Bout time, you lazy rat. I'm near empty. Fill me up before I have you whipped!"
"115740052-0-13716";"Ladies, entertain yourselves. I'll be right back."
"115740052-0-13717";"That's some strong stuff."
"115740052-0-13718";"Whoa. Need to sit down."
"115740052-0-13719";"Ev'thing … looks … funny."
"115740052-0-13720";"He's asleep? Already?"
"115740052-0-13721";"They don't usually nod off 'til after."
"115740052-0-13722";"Did they just pick Bhosek's pockets?"
"115740052-0-13723";"I won't tell if you won't."
"115740052-0-13724";"Ahh, good. I believe this will work."
"115740052-0-13725";"Now throw the lever and we will see what happens."
"115740052-0-13726";"Abnur Tharn, you traitorous bastard! I should have expected to find you here!"
"115740052-0-13727";"Here you are, Tharwab—the shipping logs that show Bhosek's defiance of the king's decrees."
"115740052-0-13728";"Come on. It's time to go."
"115740052-0-13729";"On your feet! Man your stations! Prepare to sail!"
"115740052-0-13730";"Don't be a fool, Titanborn. I'm trying to help you. Your hatred poisons you! Warriors are like steel. When you lose your temper, you lose your worth."
"115740052-0-13731";"Help me? You betrayed us all, then went back to licking Mannimarco's boot before the smoke cleared!"
"115740052-0-13732";"I did what I had to do. And, as a show of my good intentions, I have a gift for you. But, be warned. Coldharbour will not give it up, easily."
"115740052-0-13733";"I must say that my research does not often produce such spectacular results. Most gratifying!"
"115740052-0-13734";"Stand back. No damned pile of pebbles is going to stop me now!"
"115740052-0-13735";"I hope they see this signal in Eagle's Brook. Now I should go see Edgard at the inn and make sure everyone is safe."
"115740052-0-13736";"It's good to have you back. Are you thirsty for Daedric blood, old friend?"
"115740052-0-13737";"Did I hear that correctly? You passed me off as an Ayleid warlord?"
"115740052-0-13738";"Don't worry. I paid your family for the body."
"115740052-0-13739";"You paid my …. How long were you going to let people think I was a famous dead person?"
"115740052-0-13740";"You aren't getting any less dead, so somewhere around ""forever,"" I think. Look at it this way: now you're dead and famous."
"115740052-0-13741";"You mean you're going to keep doing this? Every day?"
"115740052-0-13742";"What brings you to Wayrest, traveler?"
"115740052-0-13743";"The marketplace. The crafters. The Mages Guild! The three-story chironasium! I've never been to a city this big before!"
"115740052-0-13744";"Then I know you'll enjoy your stay … if you stay out of dark alleys. And away from the docks. And near crowds. I'm sure you'll be perfectly fine!"
"115740052-0-13745";"Oh, yes. I'll have to hire a security staff, I think. We don't want any more surprise necromancers. Now go back to your body. I'll figure out what to do with you later."
"115740052-0-13746";"This is worse than Oblivion."
"115740052-0-13747";"I'm heading to the wyress camp site!"
"115740052-0-13748";"Prophet, Mannimarco captured Sai Sahan! He's torturing him to find out where the Amulet of Kings is hidden. We have to rescue him!"
"115740052-0-13749";"And where are you going in such a hurry, hero?"
"115740052-0-13750";"We'll meet you at the beacons! See you there, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-13752";"I'm grateful for your help. I'll head to the camp of the wyresses shortly. You can find me there."
"115740052-0-13753";"So. The schematics were here. Someone took them."
"115740052-0-13754";"I doubt they escaped."
"115740052-0-13755";"My brother should be able to decipher these. Interesting."
"115740052-0-13756";"Continue looking for the schematics. I'll meet up with you shortly."
"115740052-0-13757";"We're holding them for the moment. Herdor, are we ready to move?"
"115740052-0-13758";"Almost, sir. Gloo needs more time to prepare. And the villagers are still on the run."
"115740052-0-13759";"I'd tell her to work faster, but her eyebrows are still regrowing. Damn. We need more options."
"115740052-0-13760";"Sai! What's happened to you? What have they done?"
"115740052-0-13762";"Lyris! Lyris, I can see you! Are you really there?"
"115740052-0-13764";"Sai, you need to hold on. We're going to find you. I'll make sure of it."
"115740052-0-13765";"<<1>>! What happened?"
"115740052-0-13766";"I must get the schematics to my workshop. Join me if you wish to return to town.\n\nCome, Clanker."
"115740052-0-13767";"That thing was stronger than it looked. I'll be fine. Let's get inside."
"115740052-0-13768";"Be wary, assistant."
"115740052-0-13769";"Here they come!"
"115740052-0-13770";"Just a few moments more."
"115740052-0-13771";"Done! Let's get in there."
"115740052-0-13779";"If you'll allow me …."
"115740052-0-13780";"Did you hear that? That sounded like … no, it couldn't be."
"115740052-0-13781";"Just stay with me. We'll get out of this somehow."
"115740052-0-13782";"My daughter … she … she can't be gone."
"115740052-0-13783";"She's gone. I'm … I'm sorry. But we have to extinguish these fires somehow, otherwise we're going to join her."
"115740052-0-13784";"We don't abide cheaters in the Crucible. Double rations for the team that brings me their heads! Let the Grand Melee begin!"
"115740052-0-13785";"Yanabir, this is my new friend. Tell us what the Pariah's Hand is up to this year."
"115740052-0-13786";"Dollie, I'd like you to meet my new friend. We've come to learn what your plan is for this year's Boast."
"115740052-0-13787";"Help! They mean to feed me to their beasts!"
"115740052-0-13788";"Free at last!"
"115740052-0-13789";"Well, I'm done here. Come see me in <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-13790";"I've learned a lot from you, I think. I'll try to be brave from now on!"
"115740052-0-13791";"I'm ready this time! Let's do it!"
"115740052-0-13792";"No … my beautiful daughter. Please, say something! You have to be all right. You have to be."
"115740052-0-13793";"We have to go. We can't stay here any longer. Your daughter's gone."
"115740052-0-13794";"We just can't leave her here like this. I have to say goodbye. Wait! What are you doing? What's happening?"
"115740052-0-13796";"Excellent! You're doing very well!"
"115740052-0-13797";"Oh dear. Please, save me! Help!"
"115740052-0-13798";"Help! Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-13799";"We're going to die! I just know it!"
"115740052-0-13800";"That's … unbelievable. Come get me out of here."
"115740052-0-13801";"Did you just . . . wow. I need to quit drinking."
"115740052-0-13802";"Come on, pretty bug … time to give up your innards."
"115740052-0-13803";"Hot guts! That's what I'm talking about!"
"115740052-0-13804";"We did it! The voices … the whispering … it's gone!"
"115740052-0-13805";"This whole time, it was like watching myself from a distance. I felt … disconnected."
"115740052-0-13806";"But now, this is the best I've felt in years. Like I've been reborn! And I owe it all to you. Thank you."
"115740052-0-13807";"Let's get out of here! We need to rescue Sai, then we've got a world to save!"
"115740052-0-13810";"Hey! Can you help?"
"115740052-0-13811";"Shove off, this is my spot!"
"115740052-0-13812";"Who are you? Why are you dressed as a brother?"
"115740052-0-13813";"One never knows what's going to happen when working on Dwemer devices."
"115740052-0-13814";"I'm running a game here, lady. Get gone before my partner comes back with my ring."
"115740052-0-13815";"Your ring? Are you stealing Rid-Thar's ring? Thief! Thief!"
"115740052-0-13816";"Oh hush. And look, my partner's come back! Let's talk, partner! There's a lot of coin in it for you."
"115740052-0-13817";"Hah, see that priestess? My partner is wise. Very wise!"
"115740052-0-13818";"I know where she's going."
"115740052-0-13819";"Both of you make the Moons weep. Dark Moon stalk your steps!"
"115740052-0-13820";"Go after her! If you're a part of the story, you can enter!"
"115740052-0-13821";"You see, thief? There are still good and true people in this world."
"115740052-0-13822";"You're both idiots. At least I can sell this robe for a coin or two. Drinks for Jurak tonight!"
"115740052-0-13823";"Help! Someone help me! Sheor's beard, I didn't think today would end this badly!"
"115740052-0-13824";"The Daggerfall Covenant needs a stronger ruler, Emeric. Your reign as High King has come to an end. I'm taking Wayrest."
"115740052-0-13825";"Damn it, Godrun. We've been friends for years …! How can you just betray me like this?"
"115740052-0-13826";"Last place I saw it was over by my boat."
"115740052-0-13827";"Careful now! Those mudcrabs are tough!"
"115740052-0-13828";"I'm just going to stay over here. You know. Don't want to crowd you."
"115740052-0-13829";"We have them on the run! Everyone move up to the tower!"
"115740052-0-13830";"Oh gods!"
"115740052-0-13831";"Huh. Maybe it's not work—"
"115740052-0-13832";"You there! Are the Houndsmen gone?"
"115740052-0-13834";"Tell your soldiers to stand down, Sergeant. When the reinforcements come, we march south."
"115740052-0-13835";"Stand down? What do you mean? This is our chance to finish the ogres off!"
"115740052-0-13836";"Sounds like it worked! I'm going to go bask in the devastation."
"115740052-0-13837";"<<1>>, my love. Thank the gods you're alive."
"115740052-0-13838";"I'm well enough to walk. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-13839";"Where'd I put that blasted shield!"
"115740052-0-13840";"The cats keep teasing me about my … vocation. Say I don't know what's funny. But they'll see. We've trapped some wee critters from the forest!"
"115740052-0-13841";"You're going with some critter underfoot tricks?"
"115740052-0-13842";"Baan Dar himself will be laughing when those cats start running from our mice. Hah!"
"115740052-0-13843";"Sounds funny, Dollie. Good luck with your tricks. Traveler, can I speak to you in private?"
"115740052-0-13844";"We have been feasting and drinking on our own trickery, Aniel! Hidden traps, potions of transformation … the Hand is at its finest this year."
"115740052-0-13845";"Good to hear! Do you think you'll earn your way into the Dance?"
"115740052-0-13846";"Oh yes. The Khajiit are first in the eyes of Baan Dar! And we will prove ourselves worthy of the Dance!"
"115740052-0-13847";"Come along, my friend, we should be away. Let's go meet Dolirdor."
"115740052-0-13848";"Let's talk about this, I have an idea."
"115740052-0-13849";"What creatures  have come to visit my tomb? Come join me, the others will be here soon."
"115740052-0-13850";"I'm not alone you know. The others, they keep me company. I feel them coming now."
"115740052-0-13851";"Can you see them? No? Oh, they can be so shy. You just need to be properly introduced. Let me show you."
"115740052-0-13852";"Join my nightmare."
"115740052-0-13853";"Now do you see?"
"115740052-0-13855";"No, no! This is all wrong."
"115740052-0-13856";"I don't want you to see anymore. Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-13857";"I won't be alone. I can't."
"115740052-0-13858";"Look what you've done, How can I manage now?!?"
"115740052-0-13859";"I'll take care of this myself."
"115740052-0-13860";"Some of the taxes from the citizens could go to help local merchants expand."
"115740052-0-13861";"When you think about it, we merchants shouldn't have to pay taxes at all. We're bringing business into the village!"
"115740052-0-13863";"Don't question my orders! Just tell the commander we need more soldiers and more supplies."
"115740052-0-13864";"Yes, General. If you say we need them, then we need them."
"115740052-0-13866";"Let's hope our luck holds. Prepare for the next attack."
"115740052-0-13867";"That's enough, sergeant. Prepare for the next attack."
"115740052-0-13868";"Let's hope we made the right call. Now, go."
"115740052-0-13869";"Our recruit saved them, sir. We're lucky they were here."
"115740052-0-13870";"We did what we had to do, sir."
"115740052-0-13871";"Yes, sir."
"115740052-0-13872";"We could have saved lives. We knew those people."
"115740052-0-13873";"You dare step foot on our ship?"
"115740052-0-13875";"Another shipment of supplies?"
"115740052-0-13877";"So we're moving camp and more supplies are coming? Sounds like this campaign's going to be longer than we thought."
"115740052-0-13878";"Where did Jakarn hide the gem?"
"115740052-0-13879";"Maybe you should ask your Headman. The king of crooks!"
"115740052-0-13880";"Careful what you say, Elf."
"115740052-0-13881";"I'm not afraid of you. My family could buy this whole island."
"115740052-0-13883";"Captain, this isn't easy for me to say, but I want to apologize for ignoring your warnings."
"115740052-0-13884";"It was nothing, my King. I apologize if I was impertinent in my duty."
"115740052-0-13885";"Not at all, Aresin. Rise, please. In service to Daggerfall, our friend here is to have any support the watch or the knights can provide."
"115740052-0-13886";"Of course. We'll do whatever we can to help find Angof and determine his motives. All of Daggerfall stands behind our hero."
"115740052-0-13887";"Tell me quickly and truthfully. How do we fare?"
"115740052-0-13888";"Maraya … I don't understand. I know we wed for political reasons, but I thought that over the years you actually came to … I thought you loved me. If I've lost your support, then I have lost everything."
"115740052-0-13889";"I rue the day my father gave you my hand in marriage. You're not worthy of being my husband, and you're certainly not worthy of being my king!"
"115740052-0-13890";"You will see, beast. You will see."
"115740052-0-13891";"Everyone dead? This one is getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-13892";"My condolences to your families for the hardship you've had to face. My soldiers and I failed to protect you as we were sent to do. I will ensure that I find who is responsible for this, and avenge our people."
"115740052-0-13893";"Fascinating!"
"115740052-0-13894";"Curse it, I can't use my hands! Assistant, you'll need to free me."
"115740052-0-13895";"My friend, I must speak with you."
"115740052-0-13896";"What about the cult? You crazy old wizard!"
"115740052-0-13897";"Nonsense, dear. Just send down one of our most capable assistants."
"115740052-0-13900";"How are we looking, Gloo?"
"115740052-0-13901";"Rangers! We face the elite troops of the Colovian army! They've attacked us in our homes. They threaten our lives, and our founder! Are you afraid of them?"
"115740052-0-13902";"No! You're not. These dogs will learn the cost of war! They will learn what it means to face the Vinedusk Rangers!"
"115740052-0-13903";"That's what I want to hear! Recruit, grab some of the admixture Gloo's prepped. We'll scout ahead."
"115740052-0-13904";"We have enough admixture to set Arenthia ablaze if we want to. Which would make some nice after-battle entertainment, now that I think about it."
"115740052-0-13905";"Stop the bloodshed. We should talk."
"115740052-0-13906";"You cross Zurana? You die!"
"115740052-0-13910";"We can do this one of two ways. The quick way … or the slow way."
"115740052-0-13911";"Let's go back to the village."
"115740052-0-13914";"This should be the work of a moment."
"115740052-0-13915";"Just need to attune this spell matrix …."
"115740052-0-13916";"Mephala! You face Telenger the Artificer! Learn what it means to snare one such as me in your web!"
"115740052-0-13917";"Rise, blast you! Why won't you rise? This spell should work on an Ayleid!"
"115740052-0-13918";"Yes! Feel that destructive power of fire!"
"115740052-0-13919";"Don't you wish you could just bathe in the flames sometimes? Feels so. Invigorating."
"115740052-0-13920";"Are you done in there, Glooredel?"
"115740052-0-13921";"Ah, good. It's time to leave. Rangers! We move!\n\nYou, get outside and start the carnage. The fun starts now!"
"115740052-0-13922";"Hey there! Need any help?"
"115740052-0-13923";"You! Hey you!"
"115740052-0-13925";"Nanwen! What in Oblivion? You look … good. Endarwe will be thrilled to see you!"
"115740052-0-13927";"We cannot resist much longer. They will break us."
"115740052-0-13928";"We will resist as long as we are able."
"115740052-0-13929";"No telling what those Sea Drakes have done to Iriana. And Shamal too."
"115740052-0-13930";"Iriana's dead by now. We need to get out of here before those bastards return."
"115740052-0-13931";"You're too late! Gar Xuu Gar comes!"
"115740052-0-13932";"Trelan is hurt, bad. Now what are we going to do?"
"115740052-0-13933";"Nothing. We can't attack a whole camp of Sea Drakes."
"115740052-0-13934";"But we can't leave Iriana to those jackals."
"115740052-0-13935";"So, see anything?"
"115740052-0-13936";"Nothing. Those dogs hit us and ran off."
"115740052-0-13937";"I hear you, but we can't do anything with Trelan hurt."
"115740052-0-13938";"I want to skin those Sea Drakes!"
"115740052-0-13939";"I can't believe they ambushed us like that and took Iriana."
"115740052-0-13940";"We thought we were safe. But no place is safe on this island."
"115740052-0-13942";"I feel sick."
"115740052-0-13943";"I need another drink."
"115740052-0-13946";"Come on <<1>>. Your friend saved my life, but apparently didn't have time to save yours."
"115740052-0-13948";"<<1>>? I didn't think I'd see you again!"
"115740052-0-13950";"Soon, I'll be dead. And you'll be back to where you started. With nothing."
"115740052-0-13951";"hoots excitedly as he spots a buried item."
"115740052-0-13952";"Then you can die screaming."
"115740052-0-13953";"Try and keep up!"
"115740052-0-13954";"Hope you're not keeping score!"
"115740052-0-13955";"We're sticking together from now on. I promise."
"115740052-0-13956";"Thank you."
"115740052-0-13957";"Let's get back to work, friend."
"115740052-0-13958";"We've got the sap, brother. One trip to the alchemist, and you'll be right as rain!"
"115740052-0-13959";"Are you insane? Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-13961";"Blessing of my house and kin upon you."
"115740052-0-13962";"You are like the champions of old. Thank you."
"115740052-0-13963";"Please, Alanaire, just play."
"115740052-0-13964";"It's beautiful!"
"115740052-0-13965";"How did you get in here? Sabina! Crispus! Take them!"
"115740052-0-13966";"Story? No, it is a vision of what is to come, shaped according to my whim!"
"115740052-0-13967";"You assured us you could handle these foolish Altmer, Matriarch, and they are slaughtering your soldiers. Our storm spell is nearly complete, but we need the time you promised us."
"115740052-0-13968";"My nestlings will tear these Altmer intruders to pieces."
"115740052-0-13969";"Talk is cheap. Stormreeve Neidir demands action. Kill them or so help me your head will be mounted on the mast of my ship."
"115740052-0-13970";"I will see to it personally."
"115740052-0-13971";"Interlopers! We can't allow them any farther into these caves! Kill them!"
"115740052-0-13972";"Bloodthorns! To arms! The Red Rooks have betrayed us!"
"115740052-0-13973";"Fool! The Silvenar is mine to control, and mine alone!"
"115740052-0-13974";"Well met, Founder. I hope the Colovian dogs did not disturb you?"
"115740052-0-13975";"Stand up, soldiers. I'm dead, not divine. I'm fine. They were afraid even to look on my old bones."
"115740052-0-13976";"We've cleared the Colovians out, Founder. Even got you a gift!"
"115740052-0-13977";"A gift?"
"115740052-0-13978";"Victory."
"115740052-0-13979";"Hurry, friend! We must check on Nendaer! Follow us!"
"115740052-0-13980";"Forever! Just the two of us, you'll see!"
"115740052-0-13981";"You won't take her! I'll see you dead, just like the rest!"
"115740052-0-13982";"No! She'll never be yours! She's <<1>>'s!"
"115740052-0-13983";"Wait, don't go! Please, help me."
"115740052-0-13984";"The head of the survey team, <<1>>. <<2>> swore to protect her."
"115740052-0-13985";"Killed recently … is that the lieutenant's sword? He must be nearby!"
"115740052-0-13986";"You're going to use my coin to buy a gown? \n\nWait until you get to Aetherius, <<1>>. You'll have me to deal with again …."
"115740052-0-13987";"You're just jealous of how good I'm going to look!"
"115740052-0-13988";"Two sets of tracks. One moving slowly, the other limping. We're getting close!"
"115740052-0-13989";"The rain's washed away any sign of tracks. Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-13990";"Wounds made by a sword … and tracks heading south. Heavier going than coming, so they must've took something from here."
"115740052-0-13991";"The Captain, he … you've got to stop him!"
"115740052-0-13992";"You're hurt! Who did this?"
"115740052-0-13993";"<<1>>!"
"115740052-0-13994";"We've found the invaders!"
"115740052-0-13995";"Watch your step!"
"115740052-0-13996";"Hear ye, hear ye! All residents of Daggerfall! Stay indoors tonight for your own safety!\n\nThe watch is looking into a series of murders and they don't want you to be the next victim."
"115740052-0-13997";"Hear ye, hear ye! The curfew has been lifted! The murderer has been caught and the assassin has been dispatched by the champion of the King."
"115740052-0-13998";"Hear ye, hear ye! Travel through the woods of Daenia is highly discouraged at the present time! An unknown corruption has agitated the usually peaceful spirits of the vale."
"115740052-0-13999";"Hear ye, hear ye! The danger to the Daenia woods has passed! The Beldama Wyrd report that a mighty champion assisted them in healing the land's corruption!"
"115740052-0-14000";"Hear ye, hear ye! Messengers from the Lion Guard have brought word that they have begun a quarantine of the city of Camlorn. They assure the King that the plague there shall not spread."
"115740052-0-14001";"Hear ye, hear ye! A runner from the Lion Guard has just brought news that Camlorn has been liberated! The werewolves of Camlorn have been vanquished!"
"115740052-0-14002";"Hear ye, hear ye! The villain Angof—wanted Reachmage, necromancer, and enemy of the crown—has been slain at Cath Bedraud!"
"115740052-0-14003";"Of course, <<1>>! It's a beautiful first kill!"
"115740052-0-14004";"How could I not? But … the spinners have summoned me. I must go to Silvenar."
"115740052-0-14005";"Then you'll …."
"115740052-0-14006";"If the spinners say I am, then I must be. We … we weren't meant to be."
"115740052-0-14007";"The Green Lady? But that's impossible!"
"115740052-0-14008";"No! You must refuse. <<1>>, we will not be torn apart like this!"
"115740052-0-14009";"<<1>>, please. My part in this story is … over."
"115740052-0-14010";"Then the story is wrong!"
"115740052-0-14011";"You shouldn't have come, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-14012";"They fear him, <<1>>! With Hircine's aid, we could …."
"115740052-0-14013";"The Daedric Prince? I won't hear any more. If you think I'd turn against my people, you're mad."
"115740052-0-14014";"I don't care what it takes. <<1>>, I won't let this die. I'll do anything for you!"
"115740052-0-14015";"Anything? Then stop! My duty is to my people. I will protect them from any threat. Even you!"
"115740052-0-14016";"<<1>> …."
"115740052-0-14017";"Take back the amulet, <<1>>. Take it, and remember what we once were."
"115740052-0-14018";"This isn't over. This is not the end!"
"115740052-0-14020";"He can't be!"
"115740052-0-14022";"Ahh …. Welcome to my web, mortals."
"115740052-0-14023";"Mephala! A Daedric Prince herself in these tunnels! I should have known."
"115740052-0-14024";"Do be quiet, Artificer. Your companion is far more intriguing."
"115740052-0-14025";"Come, child. Speak with me."
"115740052-0-14026";"Trust nothing she says, assistant."
"115740052-0-14027";"I miss the days when this town was safer."
"115740052-0-14028";"You should be careful what you say in public, my friend."
"115740052-0-14029";"When Hosni was in town, you knew where everyone stood. I don't trust that Khajiit he left here."
"115740052-0-14030";"Any news from Farwatch? I fear the worst."
"115740052-0-14031";"I'm happy to report that a messenger just brought word. The Dominion soldiers have been repelled from Farwatch."
"115740052-0-14033";"I've had it with the Dominion! They're going to keep raiding our shores until we push them back to Summerset!"
"115740052-0-14034";"Damn straight I did! The Covenant needs swords, so I enlisted."
"115740052-0-14035";"That's wonderful news, Commander. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-14036";"Did you sign up?"
"115740052-0-14037";"Ahh, I felt something happening up here. Well done! Can't wait to see you inside."
"115740052-0-14038";"Falinesti return to us."
"115740052-0-14039";"Falinesti cleanse us."
"115740052-0-14040";"We worship you."
"115740052-0-14041";"Ayleids! Damn you, help me!"
"115740052-0-14042";"Stay back! I hold destruction in my hands!"
"115740052-0-14043";"Leave, now, or I'll use this relic to obliterate you!"
"115740052-0-14044";"Help me! Help me, damn you all!"
"115740052-0-14045";"Renwic! Surrender now, and I'll spare your worthless life."
"115740052-0-14046";"Magic cannot save you. Surrender or die!"
"115740052-0-14047";"You will not harm my people. Draw steel!"
"115740052-0-14048";"Targoth! Bury this elf-loving fool. Those who remain will accept exile or die."
"115740052-0-14049";"We beg you."
"115740052-0-14050";"Grace us with your presence."
"115740052-0-14051";"You must return."
"115740052-0-14052";"Seems the same savior of Velyn Harbor was the force behind Silvenar's recovery."
"115740052-0-14053";"I don't believe it. No one could be that good!"
"115740052-0-14054";"The Khajiit could use someone like that, if the stories are true."
"115740052-0-14055";"Shh, come here. And be quiet."
"115740052-0-14056";"You'll get nothing from me!"
"115740052-0-14057";"Yes commander!"
"115740052-0-14058";"All right, we've got work to do."
"115740052-0-14059";"We've lost many securing this beach. Search for supplies and see if you can find wounded worth saving. Strict triage—we are bound to lose more before this day is over and I don't want to waste healing on the dead."
"115740052-0-14060";"As for you .…"
"115740052-0-14061";"Shipwrecked soldiers and waterlogged vessels could come onto shore at any moment. I need you to direct the survivors and search for more out at sea. We're going to need as many capable fighters as we can get. Move out."
"115740052-0-14062";"You … you're bluffing. You'd never do something that stupid."
"115740052-0-14063";"Oh, you must have missed my fire in the village. It was glorious."
"115740052-0-14064";"Gods, you weren't joking? Festius! That's our commander. He and his aides command the assault from inside the ruins! Just stop, please!"
"115740052-0-14065";"Very brave. You've earned this."
"115740052-0-14066";"Just like old times, isn't it? I do like to have such a useful too— uh, ally, with me."
"115740052-0-14067";"I want every corner of this cave searched. Just because that lamia matriarch's dead doesn't mean we get sloppy. If we get ambushed someone's falling on their own sword."
"115740052-0-14068";"Did you hear that the Duke of Camlorn was kidnapped? First he lost his city and now this."
"115740052-0-14069";"Root, earth, water, grow. Spirit of the Green, sprout and show."
"115740052-0-14070";"Right. Gloo, get up there. I need to confer with our friend here."
"115740052-0-14071";"And we wait."
"115740052-0-14072";"Hmm? Yes, dear. That's terrible."
"115740052-0-14073";"Excellent. Go ahead, my new friend. Speak to it."
"115740052-0-14074";"Who disturbs me?"
"115740052-0-14075";"Did you hear that the hunter Gloria sacrificed herself to save the Duke? Would you do that for me, Bruno?"
"115740052-0-14076";"Hmm? Yes, dear. Of course, dear."
"115740052-0-14077";"I would speak to you again, mortal. Come through the mirror, to Quagmire."
"115740052-0-14078";"Quickly! Over here!"
"115740052-0-14079";"Bruno, Bruno! Jacqueline told me that she saw the Duke turn into a werewolf! Isn't that terrifying?"
"115740052-0-14080";"Hmm? Werewolf? Yes, dear. Right away, dear."
"115740052-0-14081";"I tire of sitting here, Meleril. We should head to Saintsport."
"115740052-0-14082";"Why?"
"115740052-0-14083";"This waiting rots my limbs and wearies my mind."
"115740052-0-14084";"There you are. Do not panic, only you can see me. Come, we have to talk."
"115740052-0-14085";"I saw a large group of soldiers leaving the Lion Guard camp. I wonder what's going on?"
"115740052-0-14086";"Hmm? Oh, yes. I heard they're going to try to retake Camlorn."
"115740052-0-14087";"They're scum over there. They just lure ships onto the rocks and strip the wrecks."
"115740052-0-14088";"Bruno, did you hear the good news? They say the Lion Guard liberated Camlorn. Now all these refugees can go home."
"115740052-0-14089";"All true, Meleril. Yet at least we would earn coin."
"115740052-0-14090";"You go if you want. I'm staying here and waiting for a ship."
"115740052-0-14091";"Hmm? Really, dear? That's great news, great news indeed."
"115740052-0-14092";"Peace, Meleril. No call for such talk. I remain and will pray for patience."
"115740052-0-14093";"I don't want any loafing around! Don't care if you're tired from scaling that sheer cliff. I'd ask you to do it again in a second. Spread out and search this place. We'll need all the supplies we can get."
"115740052-0-14094";"Shamal must leave this evil place!"
"115740052-0-14095";"How in the Eight do you expect to trap a flying harpy with a trap set on the ground? You're an idiot, you know that, right?"
"115740052-0-14096";"Looks like we found the Remly brothers."
"115740052-0-14097";"You know I hate it when you yell at me, brother. Now calm down and help me figure out how to get a harpy to trip a wire on the … ground. Hmm, I see the problem now."
"115740052-0-14098";"My fondest memory, used against me for such dark purpose."
"115740052-0-14100";"I can't, Merano, I just can't."
"115740052-0-14101";"You can, you must. I know you want to."
"115740052-0-14102";"But it would be wrong, I think. And dangerous."
"115740052-0-14103";"Nonsense. You kiss him, I stab him, and then you're free!"
"115740052-0-14104";"You make it sound so simple."
"115740052-0-14105";"It is. Let's do it tonight!"
"115740052-0-14106";"Tonight? Hush—someone's listening."
"115740052-0-14108";"I heard Dunmer were spotted just down the river."
"115740052-0-14109";"Really? I've never seen one before. Hope they aren't planning a raid."
"115740052-0-14110";"I know what you mean. My heart might give out if there's another battle."
"115740052-0-14111";"The Green Lady knows the forest's will. She'd give up her life rather than shirk her duty."
"115740052-0-14112";"You have the scroll. Rejoice that you did not fail. Vardan will be pleased."
"115740052-0-14113";"I live to serve my masters."
"115740052-0-14114";"Go west to the Ayleid site. The scroll's ritual should enable you to succeed where the others failed."
"115740052-0-14115";"I will not fail you, mistress!"
"115740052-0-14116";"Hircine laid a trap and I walked into it. If I'd known, would I've chosen a different path?"
"115740052-0-14117";"Ahead waits <<1>>. I hope you are both strong enough to overcome this."
"115740052-0-14118";"Captain! Blessed Y'ffre, I found you."
"115740052-0-14119";"Sister Safia was never worthy of you."
"115740052-0-14120";"At one time there was a spark between Safia and I, but she doesn't hold a candle to you."
"115740052-0-14121";"Durak is weak. The Shard should be ours."
"115740052-0-14122";"Stealing from Durak will be as easy as stealing a sweetroll from a baby."
"115740052-0-14123";"Good. This should be the last conduit. Let's take it apart."
"115740052-0-14124";"Now, read the scroll! The ritual it holds will send you into the spirit realm."
"115740052-0-14125";"Should you succeed, I will follow."
"115740052-0-14126";"In the name of the Bloodthorns, enter the spirit realm!"
"115740052-0-14127";"Failure again! Perhaps an ancient curse lingers here. I will try the ritual in our lair."
"115740052-0-14130";"Lord Gharesh-ri is wounded, but alive!"
"115740052-0-14131";"There's never anything new here. Perhaps a ship will come soon."
"115740052-0-14132";"The ambassador must know about this!"
"115740052-0-14133";"There you are, my poor darling. You must have been sleepwalking again. You were gone when I woke up."
"115740052-0-14134";"Yes, dear. Sleepwalking. Again."
"115740052-0-14135";"Wait … is that Gelvin up there? What in Malacath's name is he tangled up in?"
"115740052-0-14136";"Was my little cuddle bear frightened? You're safe now. I'll get you to my mother's. Have you snug as a bug in a rug in no time. And don't worry. I'll kill anyone or anything that gets in our way."
"115740052-0-14137";"Yes, dear. I'm sure you will."
"115740052-0-14138";"Well, that's enough excitement for one day. Come along, dearest. The sooner we get you to safety, the sooner I can get back to work."
"115740052-0-14139";"Well, look who's here."
"115740052-0-14140";"Thank you, old friend. Thought I was going to become bird food before you got here."
"115740052-0-14141";"Thanks, stranger. For nothing."
"115740052-0-14142";"Don't forget to thank the kind stranger for helping you, dear."
"115740052-0-14143";"Let me guess, you want into the Bloodthorn's secret lair?"
"115740052-0-14144";"I unburdened their secret entrance of its lock."
"115740052-0-14145";"This is a fresh kill. Be alert. Whatever did this could be watching us."
"115740052-0-14146";"May those who met their demise find peace now."
"115740052-0-14147";"That's all that Lord Diel asked us to do. Let's head back, but I want to have a chat before we enter the camp."
"115740052-0-14148";"How long are we going to wait, Uggnath?"
"115740052-0-14149";"Until a ship comes in."
"115740052-0-14150";"Maybe we could kill Kaleen and take the ship back."
"115740052-0-14151";"Ha! That'd end the waiting 'cause we'd be dead!"
"115740052-0-14152";"It's only her and Lambur. Mostly."
"115740052-0-14153";"More'n enough to take any ten of us. Sit down and shut up."
"115740052-0-14154";"What's this? Yes, I feel your power. But how do you work?"
"115740052-0-14155";"Strange that such a small thing can cause such terror. It must be destroyed!"
"115740052-0-14156";"Hold on. Let's think about this."
"115740052-0-14157";"What's to think about? It killed hundreds of Orcs!"
"115740052-0-14158";"The cultists did that. In the right hands, this could defend the Covenant against invaders."
"115740052-0-14159";"I'm not giving that thing to the people who leveled Orsinium!"
"115740052-0-14160";"Nah, nah, nah, 's'not how it was."
"115740052-0-14161";"Were too."
"115740052-0-14162";"You can't keep them like this, Lord Diel. They're in pain!"
"115740052-0-14163";"I can do what I like with them. After all, I'm the one investigating why these birdies have become so very, very angry."
"115740052-0-14164";"She didn't wanna stop raidin'. Fahahaha … Fararara … the king made her!"
"115740052-0-14165";"You don't know nothing."
"115740052-0-14166";"Do too, ya drunk."
"115740052-0-14167";"In the morning, I'll be sober but you'll still be stupid."
"115740052-0-14168";"Ha! You won't be sober in the mornin'."
"115740052-0-14169";"Argh! When Gelvin gets back, he won't stand for this!"
"115740052-0-14170";"Dealing with fools and idealists makes me thirsty. I need a drink."
"115740052-0-14171";"Only one of these will unbar the way. Choose carefully."
"115740052-0-14172";"Choose carefully where you place your mark. Only one will open the path."
"115740052-0-14173";"We're nearly there! Choose and be done with it!"
"115740052-0-14174";"A proper application of magic to these stones … and the way is open!"
"115740052-0-14175";"You go and talk to him. I'll wait out here. Remember what I said. Daggers first. Ideals second."
"115740052-0-14176";"Your efforts honor us, champion."
"115740052-0-14177";"I feel the spirits of my warriors return to rest. And so I shall follow."
"115740052-0-14178";"Be bold, warrior. The cultists still plague this island. You will meet them again, to their sorrow."
"115740052-0-14180";"Give me a moment … to get my bearings. Let's go over events on the way back."
"115740052-0-14181";"Why do evil lairs always smell so bad?"
"115740052-0-14182";"This place reminds me of the Grave. Great memories …."
"115740052-0-14183";"At last—success! I can enter the spirit realm. The next phase of our mission can begin!"
"115740052-0-14184";"TestPen5 - Event Enter Range"
"115740052-0-14185";"TestPen5 - Event Max Range"
"115740052-0-14186";"Follow me. The best view is just ahead."
"115740052-0-14188";"Wrong way. I'm heading back."
"115740052-0-14189";"You found something, didn't you? What is it?"
"115740052-0-14190";"<<1>>, remember your soldiers! You failed them all, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-14191";"So strong! We'll delight in wearing your skin!"
"115740052-0-14192";"Then … it's over."
"115740052-0-14193";"<<1>>, you've brought me a present? Ah, a strong vessel for us to fill!"
"115740052-0-14195";"A fresh meal! Prepare to die!"
"115740052-0-14196";"Something's wrong. All the doubt, the fear, the loneliness … it's all coming back! I … I have to push through this! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-14197";"These lost souls are barely aware of their humanity. The guards don't even beat them anymore."
"115740052-0-14198";"This place is a labyrinth of hopelessness, built to compound the misery of those who labor here."
"115740052-0-14199";"Watch your step. All the mining has made these tunnels unstable."
"115740052-0-14200";"So many Daedric beasties, so little time. We need to keep moving."
"115740052-0-14201";"Have you seen Ornandel?"
"115740052-0-14202";"Never mind. I'll check his house."
"115740052-0-14203";"We'll drink Vulkwasten's rotmeth until it's gone!"
"115740052-0-14204";"Your Daggers have done a good job, Gelvin. Even if you did … lose your way for a bit. Still, you've earned your pay."
"115740052-0-14205";"Did you get all the pieces?"
"115740052-0-14206";"Yeah, I stashed them in the footlockers all around camp. I bet the commander makes her run fifty laps this time!"
"115740052-0-14207";"Fifty? Let's hope the beast gets a lashing."
"115740052-0-14208";"All right, let's get back to it. Act natural."
"115740052-0-14209";"Stendarr defend us! That thing! It's the source of all my fears! I can hear it whispering to me. Taunting me!"
"115740052-0-14211";"I'll catch up with you later. These Bloodthorns need to be robbed."
"115740052-0-14212";"I'm happy that we were able to help, my lord. This gold will be a big help to the Daggers."
"115740052-0-14213";"Next time I need assistance, I shall call upon the Daggers again. Now—You, on the boat! Be careful with that!"
"115740052-0-14214";"Return, <<1>>. Return and leave your memories behind."
"115740052-0-14215";"Make sure to keep that fire under control!"
"115740052-0-14216";"You did the right thing, old friend. Don't beat yourself up over it."
"115740052-0-14217";"I hope you're right, Bumnog. I hope you're right."
"115740052-0-14218";"I'm gonna rob this place clean, later."
"115740052-0-14219";"We could always ask them to leave the island."
"115740052-0-14220";"The stench of these Orcs is unbearable."
"115740052-0-14222";"Send for me if you need me, sire."
"115740052-0-14223";"Another one of S'rashi's debt collectors sent to die."
"115740052-0-14224";"I'll see you later. This place needs robbing."
"115740052-0-14225";"This isn't right! What … what's happening?"
"115740052-0-14226";"I'm staying here. Come back when you're ready."
"115740052-0-14227";"Let's go. We must stop this"
"115740052-0-14228";"That's what cats get when they try to blackmail the Veiled Heritance."
"115740052-0-14229";"You wandered into the wrong hollow, friend."
"115740052-0-14230";"Justiciars to arms! No one leaves alive."
"115740052-0-14231";"This is a good spot. Let's talk here before we return to the camp."
"115740052-0-14232";"Oblivion take the Canonreeve. This had better be worth it."
"115740052-0-14233";"And what do we have here? Someone who bypassed the Thalmor guards? Hmm …."
"115740052-0-14234";"You there. Could I speak with you?"
"115740052-0-14235";"Now we can put this meadery back together again. Thanks!"
"115740052-0-14237";"Guards! What in the Divine's name are you … oh no!"
"115740052-0-14238";"I'm sorry I failed you. I know you were all counting on me."
"115740052-0-14239";"Something's not right. They're … pulling me away!"
"115740052-0-14240";"Please, this way. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-14241";"This way!"
"115740052-0-14242";"You're almost there!"
"115740052-0-14243";"Ga—ah!"
"115740052-0-14244";"As you ordered Canonreeve."
"115740052-0-14245";"I don't want to die!"
"115740052-0-14246";"Justice is done."
"115740052-0-14248";"Get into that uniform and act natural. Should fool some of them at least."
"115740052-0-14249";"Now you are one of us."
"115740052-0-14250";"Go. Spread our gift."
"115740052-0-14251";"Anytime you're ready."
"115740052-0-14252";"Ah, there you are Vestige. Come to the Harborage. We must speak."
"115740052-0-14253";"This one is eternally grateful. May Jode's smile keep you safe."
"115740052-0-14254";"It is done. Good luck."
"115740052-0-14255";"What is the meaning of this interruption? Why have you contacted me?"
"115740052-0-14256";"And the blessing. Jone watch over you."
"115740052-0-14257";"It is done. Protect the Claw!"
"115740052-0-14258";"You! Get away from that!"
"115740052-0-14259";"We'll make sure of that. Spread out and get ready!"
"115740052-0-14260";"You're too late! My army feeds!"
"115740052-0-14261";"We have something important to discuss, but not here. It's not safe."
"115740052-0-14262";"Meet me at the wayshrine near the Lion Guard Redoubt. It's safer there!"
"115740052-0-14263";"No! You will not have him!"
"115740052-0-14264";"Over there! It's Mereel!"
"115740052-0-14265";"Sud-Hareem? I thought you were dead. They came in the night. Overwhelmed us."
"115740052-0-14266";"Who did this? Where's At'avar?"
"115740052-0-14267";"The relic is mine, it obeys my every command!"
"115740052-0-14268";"I don't know. At'avar and Faulor ran farther in when we were attacked."
"115740052-0-14269";"It's part of me now, you cannot have it!"
"115740052-0-14270";"Can you fight?"
"115740052-0-14271";"Yeah. Maybe I'll stay conscious this time."
"115740052-0-14272";"I … what? The pain's gone!"
"115740052-0-14273";"What's happened? So weak …."
"115740052-0-14274";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-14275";"First the blood fiend, now a gargoyle. That settles it. Vampires."
"115740052-0-14276";"Vampires? You think they know what they're dealing with?"
"115740052-0-14277";"If not, they're in for a painful lesson."
"115740052-0-14278";"So I've you to thank for dropping the barriers to the temple sanctum."
"115740052-0-14279";"Can I get you anything?"
"115740052-0-14280";"As you say."
"115740052-0-14281";"Thank Stendarr, the poison's subsided. You'll be all right."
"115740052-0-14282";"Did you hear that?"
"115740052-0-14283";"Look, it's breathing. Satisfied now, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-14284";"There's someone alive over here!"
"115740052-0-14285";"All right, you lizard! Here's the meat I collected. Pay up!"
"115740052-0-14286";"Help me get this cocoon open."
"115740052-0-14287";"<<1>> is a hunter! A hunter of great skill! She always gets her quarry, and she always, always will! Oh, the humilitude …."
"115740052-0-14288";"Hold a moment. Come here, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-14289";"<<1>> is a hunter, he hunts both east and west! If you ever need a hunter, <<1>> is the best!\n\nI'll never be able to show my face in Hissmir again …."
"115740052-0-14290";"Faulor? Can you hear me?"
"115740052-0-14291";"Boss? They have At'avar. Their leader took him farther in the ruins. Nasty looking bloodsucker."
"115740052-0-14292";"I don't care how nasty their leader is. We're smashing in every vampire head we see until I get my son back. You in?"
"115740052-0-14293";"How can I say no to a plan like that?"
"115740052-0-14294";"Your perfitudity has been exposited! Now, pay up, <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-14295";"Help, please. The urn. Not much time!"
"115740052-0-14296";"It will come to pass. I have seen the signs! Stendarr's justice will fall hard upon his wayward Redguard children!"
"115740052-0-14297";"No!"
"115740052-0-14298";"Spare us, Stendarr!"
"115740052-0-14299";"Your torment is amusing, but I have no time for it."
"115740052-0-14300";"When his blow strikes, none will be spared! Those who bow to the headman will be cleansed by the pure waters of the sea!"
"115740052-0-14301";"Deliver us, Stendarr, from the infidels!"
"115740052-0-14302";"Flee now, those who would be saved! Abandon this wicked place and you may escape the destruction!"
"115740052-0-14303";"Those who choose to stay, your fate is sealed. Stendarr's wrath is coming, beware!"
"115740052-0-14304";"Still alive, are we? Come, I will make spigots of your throats."
"115740052-0-14305";"Quickly, to Carzog's to deal with this threat!"
"115740052-0-14306";"Yes, sir!"
"115740052-0-14307";"We were wrong!"
"115740052-0-14308";"He is angry!"
"115740052-0-14312";"You won't stop the Red Rooks. I'll gut you!"
"115740052-0-14313";"Release us! Free us from this torment!"
"115740052-0-14314";"A curse binds us! Kill the vile necromancer below!"
"115740052-0-14315";"Unseal the gate. Seek me within. End this curse!"
"115740052-0-14317";"Ha! Found you!"
"115740052-0-14318";"Glad I found you! I've got news."
"115740052-0-14319";"Excellent. This altar is intact. It needs only to be attuned."
"115740052-0-14320";"Well, that took you long enough. Did you get stuck in the mud?"
"115740052-0-14321";"Excuse me. Could I speak with you for a moment?"
"115740052-0-14322";"Die!"
"115740052-0-14323";"Moonlight mote it be."
"115740052-0-14324";"Run!"
"115740052-0-14325";"They'll kill us all!"
"115740052-0-14326";"We can't fight ghosts!"
"115740052-0-14327";"Please, Noble Bhosek, reconsider your—"
"115740052-0-14328";"Made my decision, live with it."
"115740052-0-14329";"But this is unfair! My goods stolen, my livelihood—"
"115740052-0-14330";"Your problem. Stop wasting my time!"
"115740052-0-14331";"Let the Bright Moons shine down."
"115740052-0-14332";"The cool light of the moons preserve us."
"115740052-0-14333";"To Oblivion with your interference. For the Empire!"
"115740052-0-14335";"What are you doing? Return the horn or our spirits will never rest!"
"115740052-0-14337";"Help me. See if you can rouse that citizen over there. Hurry."
"115740052-0-14347";"Marius! I'm onto your treachery. You won't get this poison!"
"115740052-0-14348";"Thank you for entrusting the poison to me. I'll dispose of it safely."
"115740052-0-14349";"If you set foot in Cyrodiil again, you're dead. Do you hear me, Rhea? Dead!"
"115740052-0-14350";"She should be nearby."
"115740052-0-14351";"Almost there, hurry! I must not keep her waiting."
"115740052-0-14352";"I warned you, but you just don't listen! Stay back!"
"115740052-0-14353";"You've doomed thousands of Covenant soldiers to death. To think I once called you ""friend."""
"115740052-0-14354";"You're a fool. Thousands will die horrible deaths thanks to you. Get away from me."
"115740052-0-14355";"Let's move out!"
"115740052-0-14356";"I can see your fear!"
"115740052-0-14359";"Help me close this portal before more daedra pop out of-"
"115740052-0-14360";"You're too late. The city is ours! Tremble before the power of the Stonefire cult!"
"115740052-0-14361";"Thanks, friend. I'll close this portal once and for all."
"115740052-0-14362";"You there, soldier, come here!"
"115740052-0-14363";"Get word to the Captain, we need a dozen men ready for travel north. Firsthold is under attack!"
"115740052-0-14364";"Sir! Yes sir!"
"115740052-0-14365";"As you say, sir. I'll get to the Captain at once."
"115740052-0-14366";"Get everyone aboard; we're leaving for Daggerfall!"
"115740052-0-14367";"Yes, ma'am!"
"115740052-0-14368";"Make sure that no one gets past you, Shukul. Cover my escape!"
"115740052-0-14369";"Do you feel that? Like ice running down Zahra's back … care is needed!"
"115740052-0-14370";"Wrongness surrounds us. Step softly!"
"115740052-0-14371";"There!"
"115740052-0-14372";"We've arrived. Welcome to Daggerfall."
"115740052-0-14373";"Help! Keep these beasts away from Esan!"
"115740052-0-14374";"I know what you're planning, your Grace."
"115740052-0-14375";"I won't allow Alcaire to fall into Redguard hands."
"115740052-0-14376";"On your faces! Go! Go! Go!"
"115740052-0-14377";"You want to stay alive out there? You need to get in shape!"
"115740052-0-14378";"The barrier is down! Brace yourselves, Mages, the Daedra come!"
"115740052-0-14379";"Take a break!"
"115740052-0-14380";"Hold, Mages! This is no Daedra. What are you doing here, stranger?"
"115740052-0-14382";"You'd think the guards would've found something by now!"
"115740052-0-14383";"What, you expect them to do their jobs? Ha!"
"115740052-0-14384";"Any word on your friend?"
"115740052-0-14385";"Nothing. They've kept the morgue locked tight."
"115740052-0-14386";"The swamps've never been so dark, I say."
"115740052-0-14387";"Lock your doors tonight. They found another one."
"115740052-0-14388";"Let them come. I won't go down without a fight!"
"115740052-0-14389";"Did you hear? They finally found the killer."
"115740052-0-14390";"Hope they bled him dry for it!"
"115740052-0-14391";"Slept straight through the night! Feels like the first time in forever."
"115740052-0-14392";"Make sure you don't sleep away another morning, or you'll be short a job!"
"115740052-0-14393";"Give back that stone, graverobber!"
"115740052-0-14394";"In the name of Jone and Jode, let this artifact be filled with moonlight."
"115740052-0-14395";"Heard the Shadowscales aren't taking any more contracts."
"115740052-0-14396";"Shh! You think no contracts means no ears in town?"
"115740052-0-14397";"Sanctioned killers on our doorstep, and we're worried about invaders?"
"115740052-0-14398";"I wouldn't say that too loud. Shadowscales have a lot of friends in these parts."
"115740052-0-14399";"Hsst! It's the walker in shadow and in light!"
"115740052-0-14400";"I saw strange lights coming from <<1>>. I thought it was deserted?"
"115740052-0-14401";"Daedric ruins are never deserted. Stay away, if you know what's good for you."
"115740052-0-14402";"I'm looking for a matching piece. Know where I'd find such an artifact?"
"115740052-0-14403";"<<1>>, but you better have gold to spend. Few are willing to scrounge in Daedric ruins!"
"115740052-0-14404";"You hear the vicecanons rooted out a Dominion camp in those Daedric ruins?"
"115740052-0-14405";"Take care of this nuisance. He's trying to help the lizards."
"115740052-0-14406";"Yeah, but they had outside help. Typical."
"115740052-0-14407";"<<1>> hasn't picked up his mead cask in a while. Wonder what's wrong?"
"115740052-0-14408";"You hadn't heard? The Dominion killed him at <<1>>. Pretty serious stuff."
"115740052-0-14409";"Who else is going to drink this swill!"
"115740052-0-14410";"Seems even our hatchlings aren't safe. A friend of mine lost an egg!"
"115740052-0-14411";"Horrible! What happened?"
"115740052-0-14412";"I didn't want to pry. They'd worked so hard for that child."
"115740052-0-14413";"They say the Hist weeps with happiness when an Argonian hatches. How can a tree weep?"
"115740052-0-14414";"What nonsense. Everyone knows the Hist isn't a tree!"
"115740052-0-14415";"Oh? Maybe it's a giant Argonian dungpile! Now who's the silly one?"
"115740052-0-14416";"I just got word. I'm an uncle! An uncle!"
"115740052-0-14417";"What's the lucky tot's name?"
"115740052-0-14418";"I can't pronounce Argonian names. Have to settle for calling him ""Junior."""
"115740052-0-14419";"I saw the Keeper in town not too long ago. He looked so sad!"
"115740052-0-14420";"Didn't you hear? The hatching almost didn't happen."
"115740052-0-14421";"This is it! I found the key! Now we can go to the vault and see if we can get the device to work."
"115740052-0-14422";"I see why he's been upset. If all those unborn withered away … unthinkable."
"115740052-0-14423";"How could those Bosmer attack a nursery? Have they no shame!"
"115740052-0-14424";"You can't trust a creature that eats its own kind. Savages, the lot of them."
"115740052-0-14425";"What could the Dominion want with a dead Hist?"
"115740052-0-14426";"I didn't know the Hist could die! What does a dead Hist look like?"
"115740052-0-14427";"Dead's not quite right. It's like it's born backwards. When it dies, it turns into an egg. Or so they say."
"115740052-0-14428";"No! You can't beat me!"
"115740052-0-14430";"Sounds like someone's been in the swamp too long …."
"115740052-0-14431";"Did you hear? The alchemist is dead!"
"115740052-0-14432";"The who? You mean that crazy Altmer?"
"115740052-0-14433";"Indeed! What an evil creature. The world's better off with him gone."
"115740052-0-14434";"The Hist is saved! Maybe they'll bring it to Stormhold."
"115740052-0-14435";"I heard it was going to the Dunmer lands. A shame."
"115740052-0-14436";"What were the Dominion trying to do with the Hist?"
"115740052-0-14437";"Glad we don't have to find out. I heard the vicecanons are returning victorious!"
"115740052-0-14438";"Did you know there're still people in the old Imperial prison?"
"115740052-0-14439";"They left them to die? How heartless!"
"115740052-0-14440";"They're Imperials. They'd leave their own mother to die if it gave them an advantage!"
"115740052-0-14441";"I wonder what the Kothringi were like? Warriors? Diplomats?"
"115740052-0-14442";"They found one alive, did you hear?"
"115740052-0-14443";"Yeah, but he's probably mad. How could you survive, if your entire race died around you?"
"115740052-0-14444";"Finally got my shipment of scribs in! Seems the Renrijra've turned to different prey!"
"115740052-0-14445";"One's coming. Wait until I give the signal."
"115740052-0-14446";"Or the Khajiit lost their taste for kwama. Best not question a blessing, I suppose."
"115740052-0-14447";"I'm glad that Altmer didn't make it through the trials of the Hist. Couldn't be good intentions, whatever he wanted."
"115740052-0-14448";"Agreed. But another stranger completed the trial. I wonder what they asked?"
"115740052-0-14449";"What do you think those relics down in Bogmother did? Anything?"
"115740052-0-14450";"Only the swamps know, and they're not telling."
"115740052-0-14451";"Now!"
"115740052-0-14452";"Get up. There is no time for rest in the world of dreams."
"115740052-0-14453";"I must return the relics to their rightful places, and quickly!"
"115740052-0-14454";"My fine ladies and handsome gentleman, it is time for music. Relax and listen to my songs. Let the music soothe you."
"115740052-0-14455";"See that? That's a Dwemer memory device. I've seen them before, but never one that was intact."
"115740052-0-14456";"I see a keyhole and a picture of an orb of some kind. Why don't you see if that journal over there says anything important."
"115740052-0-14457";"I would give it all, Mira. The sword, the keep, the kingdom … all of it for you …."
"115740052-0-14458";"Ah, I hoped I'd find you two down here. I repaired the lift. What did you find?"
"115740052-0-14459";"Indal, please don't go."
"115740052-0-14460";"I have no choice. It's my duty, 'Tayah."
"115740052-0-14461";"Take this token. Pray for Indal. Promise?"
"115740052-0-14462";"I promise, Indal. Stay safe."
"115740052-0-14463";"I… I forgive you father."
"115740052-0-14464";"Jone and Jode … keep this one's brother safe."
"115740052-0-14465";"Watch over Indal. Keep him safe in the fighting to come."
"115740052-0-14466";"Bring him home. He's all I have left."
"115740052-0-14467";"Do'Krin Monastery? Is this a dream? It feels so real."
"115740052-0-14468";"Indal, I'm here. I'm sorry, brother. I am dead."
"115740052-0-14469";"'Tayah? This can't be true. This must be a dream."
"115740052-0-14470";"This is a dream for you, but I speak truth."
"115740052-0-14471";"A kindly stranger has fulfilled your sister's prayer."
"115740052-0-14472";"Jone and Jode saw fit to reunite us one final time."
"115740052-0-14473";"This can't be goodbye."
"115740052-0-14474";"Your 'Tayah will always be with you. I love you, brother."
"115740052-0-14475";"I love you, sister."
"115740052-0-14476";"Just for a moment. We need to get back to town, safer there."
"115740052-0-14477";"As soon as you're rested, we'll go. No sense running back to town just to have you die on me."
"115740052-0-14478";"Raynor, this device fills up glass orbs with old lore, like filling a decanter with fine wine!"
"115740052-0-14479";"A memory device? You found one that works?"
"115740052-0-14480";"It's intact. But we need a glass orb to see if it actually works."
"115740052-0-14481";"Did you figure out what kind of lore the device contains?"
"115740052-0-14482";"I see two important bits of lore. One explains how Dwemer used soul gems to power their constructs. The other contains a map of Dwemer ruins across Tamriel."
"115740052-0-14483";"Soul gems? That knowledge would open a lot of doors for us. A lot of doors."
"115740052-0-14484";"But think about what we can do with those maps! Access to every ruin. Those are the doors we should be opening!"
"115740052-0-14485";"Are you suggesting that we become common … treasure hunters? Well, think how famous we'll become if we bring both bits of lore to the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-14486";"I don't think we can, brother. I think there's only enough power in this device to make one imprinting."
"115740052-0-14487";"But we've worked so hard to get them to listen to us. This is our chance, sister."
"115740052-0-14488";"I'm not sure. But our friend here has found an orb we can use. Hey! What do you think we should do?"
"115740052-0-14489";"I am so sorry, my sister. I failed you."
"115740052-0-14490";"<<1>>, we need to go. It's not safe here."
"115740052-0-14491";"Fine, you stubborn fool. <<1>> and <<2>>, keep an eye on <<3>>."
"115740052-0-14492";"You got it, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-14493";"Don't worry, we'll be ready for them next time."
"115740052-0-14494";"Don't stay too long. Meet us back at the tavern."
"115740052-0-14495";"You who were condemned. Hear me. Your only hope of being released is to tell us why the dead have been risen."
"115740052-0-14496";"Your precious Champion struggles and twists, like a bug in amber. Your Champion is mine, now."
"115740052-0-14497";"You cannot stop the inevitable. The city is ours. Soon I will hold your ""Mane"" in my hand, and my Dark Mane will walk the Path. The soul of the Khajiit will be lost to darkness!"
"115740052-0-14498";"Don't take long. We must press on with our efforts."
"115740052-0-14499";"You would've been proud of our friends. Taking on that giant Storm Atronach without my help. They're almost as brave as our Rangers, you know?"
"115740052-0-14500";"Aunt? Uncle? You're alive! I'm overjoyed. I tried looking for you. Luckily the Moon-Hallowed and our friend were able to clear the city."
"115740052-0-14501";"We're proud to say we could help you during the invasion. Good luck on your Path!"
"115740052-0-14502";"You've saved one of greatest treasures of the Dominion. Dune is once again a shining jewel in the desert. Thank you."
"115740052-0-14503";"Thank you. I thought I was done for."
"115740052-0-14504";"Eagles, advance!"
"115740052-0-14505";"Aldmeri Dominion!"
"115740052-0-14506";"The Thalmor commands!"
"115740052-0-14507";"You cannot stop the forces of Javad Tharn!"
"115740052-0-14508";"I'm not a traitor! I just joined the winning side."
"115740052-0-14509";"Damn it Jorunn. Why force my hand like that? \n\nI'm sorry, I need to read these after-action reports."
"115740052-0-14510";"Sorry, I need a moment. More news from the front in Cyrodiil."
"115740052-0-14511";"Emeric, you silly fool. I'll never let you get away with that.\n\nSorry, I need to read these after-action reports."
"115740052-0-14512";"Aha! You'll fetch a pretty penny in Balmora!"
"115740052-0-14513";"Raargh!"
"115740052-0-14514";"Thank you, my friend. I'll see you on the other side!"
"115740052-0-14515";"What are you doing? You should have destroyed it!"
"115740052-0-14516";"We'll speak of this outside. Tersely."
"115740052-0-14519";"The ogres are running! We can move up! Sound the horn!"
"115740052-0-14520";"We need to find that intel. Get back in there!"
"115740052-0-14521";"Please, speak with me. I have no one else to turn to."
"115740052-0-14522";"It's an Eye of the Queen! Get him!"
"115740052-0-14523";"'Tayah, no! What's going on?"
"115740052-0-14524";"This one would speak with you again, traveler."
"115740052-0-14525";"Again Remius? You need to give up. Almerel will never let you have her."
"115740052-0-14526";"I'll never give up. Madria and I will be together, no matter what her father says!"
"115740052-0-14527";"Well, best of luck to you, Remius."
"115740052-0-14528";"Wish me luck, Lulius. I'm going to see Almerel again."
"115740052-0-14529";"You need more than luck to change Almerel's mind.  You need help from the Divines themselves!"
"115740052-0-14530";"Let's see if I can speak to this one."
"115740052-0-14531";"Come here, little one …."
"115740052-0-14532";"Yes. That would be so helpful. Thank you."
"115740052-0-14533";"It's that fool Remius again. Madria, go inside. Now."
"115740052-0-14534";"Just wanted to be sure you were well protected. Go ahead, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-14535";"Nice work. See you at the temple door."
"115740052-0-14536";"I wish you'd give him a chance, father."
"115740052-0-14537";"Off it goes. Follow it to find the skulls and then meet me at the Stone Table."
"115740052-0-14539";"Let's keep after it! They can be quick!"
"115740052-0-14542";"One more to go."
"115740052-0-14544";"Third and last!"
"115740052-0-14545";"They come for the beacon!"
"115740052-0-14546";"Last one. Then we can talk to the skulls."
"115740052-0-14547";"More of them! Watch yourself!"
"115740052-0-14548";"Let's take the skulls to the stone table to interrogate them."
"115740052-0-14549";"It is done. Thank you, Hallowed. I shall meet you at the temple entrance."
"115740052-0-14550";"Almerel—I am here once again, to beg for your daughter's hand in marriage."
"115740052-0-14551";"Never! My daughter will not marry a Breton without renown or prospects. Crawl back in your hole!"
"115740052-0-14552";"I'll never give up. Madria and I are meant to be together!"
"115740052-0-14553";"Never. I'll see her dead first!"
"115740052-0-14554";"Jone and Jode wax, rising into the darkness."
"115740052-0-14555";"The fullness of the two moons hang in the darkness above."
"115740052-0-14556";"With regret, the Bright Moons wane from the sky."
"115740052-0-14557";"The inner sanctum should be open to we pilgrims, now."
"115740052-0-14558";"Merely touch the senche, and unlock the way to the reliquary."
"115740052-0-14559";"Jone and Jode be praised. The Golden Claw, intact."
"115740052-0-14560";"An intruder, a Tharn! Destroy him!"
"115740052-0-14561";"That old cart broken again? Long past time you two bought a new one."
"115740052-0-14562";"You know Larus. He thinks he can fix anything."
"115740052-0-14565";"Hey there, Lorene. Busy as usual, eh?"
"115740052-0-14566";"At least I work sometimes, Ilwen, unlike you. Go make yourself useful for a change."
"115740052-0-14567";"Make sure you get that wine stain out of my shirt, Swifty. I want to wear it this weekend."
"115740052-0-14568";"Your hands are idle, as always, Ilwen. Feel free to wash it yourself."
"115740052-0-14569";"It is done. Bright moons be praised."
"115740052-0-14570";"Indaenir, the tunnel is finally clear. Akkhuz-ri will return to Marbruk and send soldiers to reinforce this location."
"115740052-0-14571";"Yes. Yes. That makes sense. Perhaps it's better if I go out into the pass and try to discover why Naemon ordered the undead to attack in the first place."
"115740052-0-14572";"Yes. Both of you go. Find out what Naemon is planning and report to Marbruk. Don't try to do all this on your own … and of course, may bright moons light your path."
"115740052-0-14573";"My crew will rig the mast with your entrails. Get up, boys. Time to earn your keep!"
"115740052-0-14574";"I've been underground too long. I can't wait to get back out into the forest."
"115740052-0-14575";"I didn't think I was being disrespectful."
"115740052-0-14576";"Sometimes, people are just impossible to understand."
"115740052-0-14577";"Be ready. This one is counting on you to watch his … er, her back."
"115740052-0-14578";"Asteril, is that you?"
"115740052-0-14579";"Yes. Come closer, my queen. I have something for you."
"115740052-0-14580";"A gift in memory of Prince Naemon … Vicereeve Pelidil sends his regards."
"115740052-0-14581";"What is this?"
"115740052-0-14582";"So you are trying to assassinate the queen … I mean ""me""?"
"115740052-0-14583";"You will die, and the true king of Alinor will rise again!"
"115740052-0-14584";"Argh! Divines, that hurt!"
"115740052-0-14585";"Hurry. There's no time to waste!"
"115740052-0-14586";"I think that should do it. The altars are all cleansed. I think we can finish the path now. What's that?"
"115740052-0-14587";"You are too late! The city is ours! Your faith cannot overcome the Master's Mace!"
"115740052-0-14588";"Be careful up ahead. Some of my friends came to a bad end during the fight with the Whisperer. We don't go there anymore."
"115740052-0-14589";"The Stone Table is where the Bosmer who violated the Pact received their judgment. Let's see if they remember it."
"115740052-0-14590";"Ha! We need no release. The Shade of Naemon heralds a new age—an age where we will be restored, and you are the ones who will be judged."
"115740052-0-14591";"Hold on. How do you know that? Did the Shade actually tell you that?"
"115740052-0-14592";"He doesn't have to. When the forest is transformed, who do you think will inhabit the Shadow Wood? We will!"
"115740052-0-14593";"Naemon does not have the power to release any of you, but I do. Help us, and you'll have your chance at freedom."
"115740052-0-14594";"I'll tell you. Don't listen to that fool. The Shade seeks to corrupt the forest—to create a new realm—it's called the Shadow Wood."
"115740052-0-14595";"There are already rifts between here and the Shadow Wood. Your only hope is to close them. Now, do as you promised. Release us!"
"115740052-0-14596";"You won't live to tell this tale!"
"115740052-0-14597";"The forest is haunted!"
"115740052-0-14598";"We must flee!"
"115740052-0-14599";"We've angered the forest!"
"115740052-0-14600";"Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-14601";"Careful, Shazah."
"115740052-0-14602";"Enough of this! I'll return to Tharn, and together we'll …."
"115740052-0-14603";"No! Get away from me! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-14604";"Aah!"
"115740052-0-14605";"You're going to need my help to scare the Chieftain."
"115740052-0-14606";"These woods are cursed!"
"115740052-0-14607";"Yes! This should work! The Fang is attuned with the Daedra's essence."
"115740052-0-14608";"Fire! The Abbey's on fire! Help!"
"115740052-0-14609";"Hear ye, hear ye! Citizens are warned to beware of traveling to Koeglin Village! The town was recently attacked by slavers who are suspected of still being in the area!"
"115740052-0-14610";"Hear ye, hear ye! The warning on travel to Koeglin Village has been lifted! The Knights of the Flame have sent word that order has been restored!"
"115740052-0-14611";"Hear ye, hear ye! A Redguard Army is encamped outside Alcaire Castle! The Knights of the Flame have sent word that negotiations are under way to avoid a conflict!"
"115740052-0-14612";"Hear ye, hear ye! The King has called for a day of mourning following the death of Duchess Lakana at Alcaire Castle! The Knights of the Flame say her killer has been brought to justice!"
"115740052-0-14613";"Hear ye, hear ye! The Ironhand Ogres have been driven back to Shinji's Scarp, but General Godrun warns they remain a serious threat to all Stormhaven!"
"115740052-0-14614";"Hear ye, hear ye! The Ironhand Ogres are no longer a threat to Stormhaven! General Godrun and the Orcs of Clan Murtag defeated the Ogres at the Battle of Shinji's Scarp!"
"115740052-0-14615";"Hear ye, hear ye! The King has decreed a no tolerance policy for the cult known as the Supernal Dreamers! No mercy will be given for those found guilty of aiding or consorting with cult members!"
"115740052-0-14616";"Hear ye, hear ye! The Court wishes to assure citizens that rumors of the King's illness have been greatly exaggerated! The King is quite well! In other news, the King says the Supernal Dreamers cult is no longer a threat to the people of Stormhaven!"
"115740052-0-14617";"Stay behind me, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-14618";"Try to keep up, Hallowed!"
"115740052-0-14619";"Dark Moons! This one is even stronger than the one outside."
"115740052-0-14620";"Let's see this done!"
"115740052-0-14621";"Right behind you, sister."
"115740052-0-14623";"Stage left, we have the founder of the Mages Guild, Vanus!"
"115740052-0-14624";"Stage right, we have your old, old, old, old, old friend, Archmage Shalidor!"
"115740052-0-14625";"And backstage we have Valaste, your new friend and confidant in the Mages Guild!"
"115740052-0-14626";"But what's this? Why, it's King Emeric and his friends from the Daggerfall Covenant! No doubt he's got kind words to share. Take it away, Your Highness!"
"115740052-0-14628";"For perpetuating the use of magic, we hereby burn you at the stake. Let your corruption be gone from this land once and for all!"
"115740052-0-14631";"Fildgor's troops sweep through the west as they press their assault. Our scouts report that they're fortifying their holdings in the east, as well."
"115740052-0-14632";"So the Stormfists have you trapped. That's Nord tactics, for you. You can't win battles just by swinging your axe and yelling at the top of your lungs."
"115740052-0-14633";"Seems like nobody wants you around. Hah! So, this is the final scene. Save your friends. Then I'll give you me book."
"115740052-0-14634";"I would suggest you keep your jabs in check, Dark Elf. At least we don't hide behind the skirts of a supposed god-woman."
"115740052-0-14635";"You dare insult my lady Almalexia? I would have your head on a pi —"
"115740052-0-14636";"Will you two stop it? You whine more than my egg-brother, and he's newly hatched. We need to work together."
"115740052-0-14637";"You will not tell me what to do, scaley one. I am the Prince of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-14638";"Stop it! All of you! This is the kind of behavior that got us into this mess in the first place. We need to work together to figure things out. Together."
"115740052-0-14639";"Enough! I'll get the money to Many-Eyes as soon as I can."
"115740052-0-14640";"Sheogorath is so much smarter than I am …. I'm like a child before him …."
"115740052-0-14641";"I would have given up the island for her. She never gave me the chance to decide …. My wife …."
"115740052-0-14642";"I have new orders from Pale-Heart, come speak to me at the excavation site."
"115740052-0-14643";"Books are my only friends … what happens when even books turn on me …?"
"115740052-0-14644";"I'm getting out of here, I'll meet you at Jorunn's Stand!"
"115740052-0-14645";"How'd you get in a cocoon, anyway?"
"115740052-0-14646";"I assume one of Praxin's specters did it to me after the vampires moved on."
"115740052-0-14647";"Really? I didn't know spectral spiders could do that."
"115740052-0-14648";"Learn something new every day."
"115740052-0-14649";"Cut the talking. Stay focused on finding At'avar."
"115740052-0-14651";"At'avar! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-14652";"Easy, boss. We'll find him."
"115740052-0-14653";"What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-14654";"I told you that we need to be patient. You're always in such a hurry! It's starting to get on my nerves."
"115740052-0-14655";"Last I saw her, Mereel was standing watch. If she's alive, she can't be far."
"115740052-0-14656";"You're enjoying that body too much, I think. Why, I have a mind to …."
"115740052-0-14658";"Hey, Mereel. That last one looked like your mother."
"115740052-0-14659";"Joke's on you, smooth-skin. I don't have a mother."
"115740052-0-14660";"Hide behind the rocks nearby and wait for Yjarnn. You wouldn't want him to know you were following him, now would you?"
"115740052-0-14663";"Rest well, Praxin. You cheated at cards, but you didn't deserve this."
"115740052-0-14665";"You have done well, Hallowed. But the city's heart is still tainted with darkness."
"115740052-0-14666";"Where are you going? I can't leave Murkwater."
"115740052-0-14667";"I won't allow Alcaire to fall into Redguard hands."
"115740052-0-14668";"I'm sorry, but this is the only way."
"115740052-0-14670";"This is where our own men turned on us. We had no choice … no options."
"115740052-0-14671";"Sir … my head … it hurts so much …."
"115740052-0-14672";"Tu'whacca's breath! Too many! I can't take it!"
"115740052-0-14673";"What else could I do? It was them, or us. They were insane, I tell you … insane."
"115740052-0-14674";"Get … out … of … my … head …."
"115740052-0-14675";"The voice … it speaks to my soul. I know what I must do."
"115740052-0-14676";"Kill them! Kill them all! The Whisperer demands it!"
"115740052-0-14678";"Watch and learn, maggot."
"115740052-0-14680";"Oh, that's right. They're dead. Just like you're about to be. You know, you were a real pain in my side. I sent you after Yjarnn and Marla, but somehow you survived."
"115740052-0-14681";"Then I sent you to sabotage the Prince, but instead you brought the Pact together. Well, if you want something done, you just have to do it yourself."
"115740052-0-14682";"Wait! Don't kill me! I … I can help you. Jorunn's still alive. You need me!"
"115740052-0-14683";"No one likes a liar, Nord. No one."
"115740052-0-14684";"Let's talk, hero. Why did I ever let Varon convince me to come to Eastmarch?"
"115740052-0-14686";"It's opening! Get ready everyone!"
"115740052-0-14687";"Moon Hallowed."
"115740052-0-14688";"Best move quietly. The enemy is within."
"115740052-0-14689";"Let's move!"
"115740052-0-14690";"We're right behind you, captain!"
"115740052-0-14691";"Meet me by those rocks over there. I want to get out of the wind."
"115740052-0-14692";"Let's move! I want that last Stone found and smashed! Or do you lot want to climb another cliff? It's only going to get rainier!"
"115740052-0-14693";"The flesh of the leader will add even more power to the ritual. We will be unstoppable!"
"115740052-0-14694";"You promised us release! May your lies bind your soul to the Ooze!"
"115740052-0-14695";"The Ooze thins … I'm free!"
"115740052-0-14696";"I deserve no less, I suppose."
"115740052-0-14697";"I have lived with the burden of my crimes so long … thank you."
"115740052-0-14698";"You understand. There is no resisting the second age, or the soon-to-be glory of Naemon."
"115740052-0-14699";"When will you realize, you don't matter? Naemon will call me into his service, and I will be free!"
"115740052-0-14700";"Oh how quaint. A mortal."
"115740052-0-14701";"Need? This one needs nothing but the Fang!"
"115740052-0-14702";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-14703";"… is madness! You need this ship! You need us!"
"115740052-0-14704";"My sister! Where is she? No matter, Sithis will bring us together in time."
"115740052-0-14705";"What …?"
"115740052-0-14706";"Shazah! We're ready!"
"115740052-0-14707";"Those monkeys won't escape me!"
"115740052-0-14708";"Ah, you must be here to save me. You caused quite a commotion out there, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-14709";"Where are you going? The castle's tower isn't this way. Turn around!"
"115740052-0-14710";"You still awake up here?"
"115740052-0-14711";"Barely. Only thing I heard was you snorin' in the hut."
"115740052-0-14712";"Shut up. I don't snore."
"115740052-0-14713";"Yeah, right, I'm out of here."
"115740052-0-14714";"Hey, you ready to get off of here?"
"115740052-0-14715";"About time. You're 10 minutes late!"
"115740052-0-14716";"There you are. Never leave us stranded again."
"115740052-0-14717";"Who's out there? If you're one of the Stormfists, you'll regret it if you come in here!"
"115740052-0-14718";"The light of the Moon Hallowed will shine forth."
"115740052-0-14719";"Bright moons guide your actions today, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-14720";"Vicecanon … oh, no. We're too late."
"115740052-0-14721";"We'll find who did this."
"115740052-0-14722";"Did you find any sign of who did this to him?"
"115740052-0-14723";"Wait! Over there!"
"115740052-0-14725";"Another barrier. Shazah can crack it!"
"115740052-0-14726";"Moonmont should be the heart of lunar light in Reaper's March. Instead, we are surrounded … by darkness."
"115740052-0-14727";"The altars are aligned, the darkness thrown back. Destroy the barrier, Shazah!"
"115740052-0-14728";"Stop! Don't move, or I'll strike you down!"
"115740052-0-14729";"The Stormfist bastards did their worst, yet I am still alive. Thanks to you."
"115740052-0-14730";"Seed and spleen, that was uncomfortable. I think my tail's gone numb."
"115740052-0-14731";"For blood, for glory, for power and might,\nWe of the Guild will always fight.\nFor good or evil, day or night,\nWe of the Guild will always fight.\n… Just so long as the price is right!"
"115740052-0-14732";"So many dead fools. And me, nearly one of them."
"115740052-0-14733";"Pay for your choices with your life."
"115740052-0-14734";"The Sedormis keystone belongs to the Ayleid! <<1>> must return it!"
"115740052-0-14735";"Gahh! I think my arm's broken. Gods-damned whispers!"
"115740052-0-14736";"Guard the totem. Javad Tharn has prepared a construct that can ravage this town, and I must retrieve it."
"115740052-0-14737";"You're mine now, ""Champions!"""
"115740052-0-14738";"Thank you for helping me restore my sanity … use this keystone well."
"115740052-0-14739";"Where is he?"
"115740052-0-14740";"I don't know. He should be in here."
"115740052-0-14741";"Khali! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-14742";"What?"
"115740052-0-14743";"What is this sorcerery, priest? What's happening to my father?"
"115740052-0-14744";"The dream … it's leaving the King's body. How … how is this happening?"
"115740052-0-14745";"Well now. What have we here?"
"115740052-0-14746";"The false king and his foreign allies can throw challengers at me as often as they want. I so enjoy killing them."
"115740052-0-14747";"You may have taken their lives, but Longclaws's daughters are not gone."
"115740052-0-14748";"Look at your soldiers, Jorunn. This is what happened to us. Locked away in some crypt like commoners. No one cared that we died, especially you. We were just pawns for you!"
"115740052-0-14749";"We had families. The day we died for you, we lost our lovers. Our children. You know how it feels, don't you? Yet you didn't care. You threw us out there. You let us be killed by the Akaviri!"
"115740052-0-14750";"No. I respected and cared for each and every one of you. With each of your deaths, I lost brothers and sisters. But we fought for what we all believed in. We fought for our freedom!"
"115740052-0-14751";"Listen to them. Listen to their wailing cries. They died because of you. You threw their lives away. Now you are paying for it!"
"115740052-0-14752";"All right, which one of you anchor huggers called me soft? Care to step up and defend that claim?"
"115740052-0-14753";"Shut up and go back to your drink, seaweed breath."
"115740052-0-14754";"Oh, is that so? Well, let's see how you all like it at the bottom of the reef! Let's get 'em boys!"
"115740052-0-14755";"What's going on here? Time to crack some skulls!"
"115740052-0-14756";"Well, this turned out to be an interesting hunting trip. So much for knowing the area like the back of your hand, right, sister?"
"115740052-0-14757";"Yes, yes, go ahead. Mock me, little brother. I should just leave you in this cave. Maybe you'd lose a foot to the frost and the people would call you the Gimp Prince. That would be the last time you mocked me, that's for sure."
"115740052-0-14758";"Oh, I think I would write a ballad about how an ice demon and I dueled upon the mountain tops and I drove my blade into him as he took my foot. All the ladies would find me heroic. Maybe I should let my foot fall off."
"115740052-0-14759";"Sounds like something you'd do. You're the only man I've ever known to write an epic about how you fell down and broke your nose. Did that Nord lass you brought home really believe that story about you and the troll?"
"115740052-0-14760";"This cave goes on forever. And the cold. It's bitter to the bone. I think I'm starting to lose the feeling in my legs. I hate when that happens."
"115740052-0-14761";"You sure do whine a lot, you know that? We'll find a way out of here. Stop worrying so much."
"115740052-0-14762";"Oh, I forgot. There's no need to worry! The great and wonderful Nurnhilde is here!"
"115740052-0-14763";"You hush, now, brother! Fildgor showed me how to find my way out of a cave, or any closed area, really. You just need to find the wind. Once you do that, you can figure out where it's coming from. And that's the way out. Simple!"
"115740052-0-14764";"Come on, Jorunn. We have to keep moving. We're almost there. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-14765";"Please, brother. It's just a little bit farther. You have to hold on. I … I need you. I can't become Queen without my brothers at my side. I … I just can't do it. Stay with me, brother. Wake up!"
"115740052-0-14766";"Queen Nurnhilde has spoken for you. You may cross to the Bridge."
"115740052-0-14768";"I've been looking for you."
"115740052-0-14769";"You're too late, champion! Fildgor sent us to end this false king's reign!"
"115740052-0-14770";"Go ahead. Put them on the table. I expect they'll recognize it."
"115740052-0-14771";"Let me explain how things work around here."
"115740052-0-14772";"I will bring the Crown of Freydis to my brother. Don't worry, I give you my word that this is finished."
"115740052-0-14773";"Walk this way."
"115740052-0-14774";"Selene promised <<1>> would hunt tonight. And here you are.\n\nThe Forest Mother was right again. See how she takes care of us, my daughters?"
"115740052-0-14775";"Yet this one wonders—what kind of prey walks so willingly into the hunter's lair?"
"115740052-0-14776";"Unlock the cage, please! They mean to sell Tand into slavery!"
"115740052-0-14777";"Perfect! I couldn't have done it better myself."
"115740052-0-14778";"Now, let me see that thing."
"115740052-0-14779";"We have much need of someone like you, Aranias."
"115740052-0-14781";"Good. That's finished. Now, let's close these shadow rifts."
"115740052-0-14785";"Here we go."
"115740052-0-14786";"Yes, young one. We have a problem in the Valenwood that will require your talents specifically."
"115740052-0-14787";"Many thanks. We must get out of here!"
"115740052-0-14788";"Ahh, right on time. Welcome back."
"115740052-0-14789";"I-I would be honored to help however I can."
"115740052-0-14790";"An opportunity has arisen to strike a devastating blow to the Dominion, to divide the Bosmer."
"115740052-0-14792";"The Bosmer in Greenshade claim allegiance not to King Camoran, but to a man they call ""The Wilderking."""
"115740052-0-14794";"Killing this Wilderking will drive the Bosmer mad. He is very elusive though, so I will need your help to find him."
"115740052-0-14798";"You realize we are entrusting you with an important task, I hope, my dear."
"115740052-0-14799";"Of course, Lady Estre. You can count on me."
"115740052-0-14800";"This should do it."
"115740052-0-14801";"Finally, this nightmare will come to an end."
"115740052-0-14802";"With all respect, Your Majesty, this proves our suspicions were well-founded … you should have heeded my father's warning."
"115740052-0-14803";"It is not the place of the dishonored to correct the king, Ash'abah. You are dismissed."
"115740052-0-14804";"I meant no disrespect, Your Majesty, only that … you know where to find us. I will take my leave."
"115740052-0-14805";"Are you insane, Shifty? You'll kill us all!"
"115740052-0-14806";"Mortal worm! Get away from there!"
"115740052-0-14807";"That's the point, friend! This is no way for a man to live."
"115740052-0-14810";"Hold nothing back. I break my oath as Keeper to see Rilis finished, and if he escapes, all of Tamriel will pay for our folly."
"115740052-0-14811";"Look for the glimmers of the past I spoke of. Hopefully, they will help us figure out how to put the Blackroot clan back to rest."
"115740052-0-14812";"Ha ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-14813";"I've wanted this for so very long. Now get out of my way. All of Tamriel will learn I am free when I set the land ablaze."
"115740052-0-14815";"What in Nirn?"
"115740052-0-14817";"Come on! You can do it! Just one more bite!"
"115740052-0-14818";"This is the most revolting display of power eating that I've ever witnessed. Hey! Down in front!"
"115740052-0-14819";"That bowl of jiggling jelly looks delicious! Can I get the recipe?"
"115740052-0-14820";"I think I'm going to be ill."
"115740052-0-14821";"I could eat more than all of these contestants combined! They dishonor the King with this poor showing!"
"115740052-0-14823";"Blades ready, comrade. These constructs know no mercy."
"115740052-0-14824";"The skill it took to craft these constructs. Amazing."
"115740052-0-14825";"Just think what this place must have looked like in the time of the Dwemer."
"115740052-0-14826";"You aren't like the others. You should keep your own face, it suits you better."
"115740052-0-14827";"No one can outdrink Thane Jeggi! He's got this contest in the bag!"
"115740052-0-14828";"I'm not sure about that. The Nord woman from Whiterun looks like she can hold her mead."
"115740052-0-14829";"What interesting customs you Nords have. Drink too much and throw up, all to honor your King."
"115740052-0-14830";"If they were serving hundred-year-old flin, I'd enter this contest in a heart beat."
"115740052-0-14831";"They're running low on mead! I wonder what happened to that shipment from Voljar's Meadery?"
"115740052-0-14832";"Stay away from my new face!"
"115740052-0-14833";"What's that over there?"
"115740052-0-14834";"What are you doing? Hide, before the Dominion spots you!"
"115740052-0-14835";"More wonders. And a split in the path. Which way shall we go, comrade?"
"115740052-0-14836";"They brought him past the cave. Strange … it is an old smell."
"115740052-0-14837";"They dragged him up this rise, straight ahead. He didn't struggle."
"115740052-0-14838";"I don't care how big it is. It's in my way, it dies."
"115740052-0-14839";"Thank you, friend! Quickly, meet me in that cave!"
"115740052-0-14840";"Skordo set up a rendezvous point in the north part of the pit. I'll see you there!"
"115740052-0-14841";"Holy Divines, look at the size of that thing!"
"115740052-0-14842";"Damn, she didn't make it. Find your ancestors, friend. And know that Vikord will avenge you."
"115740052-0-14843";"You continue to impress, my friend! You've beaten Blackheart. Now to finish him for good."
"115740052-0-14845";"Please! I must find him!"
"115740052-0-14846";"Farewell, my son. Tell your mother I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-14849";"You Altmer are so predictable. So arrogant."
"115740052-0-14850";"Sud-Hareem! You've escaped!"
"115740052-0-14851";"Yes, Praxin. The Whisperer is gone."
"115740052-0-14852";"I don't feel so good."
"115740052-0-14853";"No. You can't be real. I was going to rescue you. And then I heard her voice."
"115740052-0-14854";"It's over, Praxin. You can rest now."
"115740052-0-14855";"Boss, I don't think he's listening."
"115740052-0-14856";"You aren't real. You're one of her illusions. I won't let you stop us!"
"115740052-0-14857";"What is this rat doing in here? Get out you damn thing!"
"115740052-0-14858";"Why is nothing ever easy?"
"115740052-0-14859";"No! Stop! How dare you!"
"115740052-0-14860";"You're not getting away that easily!"
"115740052-0-14861";"What a skeever!"
"115740052-0-14863";"I tell you Galdas, that was impressive work. An adept facing Sheogorath himself!"
"115740052-0-14864";"Working along side Valaste herself. The Mistress of Incunabula, and an ancient Arch-Mage. Making a tart seems pretty simple in comparison."
"115740052-0-14865";"It's a whole new chapter in the Guild. All thanks to one person. Amazing."
"115740052-0-14866";"Ready!"
"115740052-0-14867";"Set!"
"115740052-0-14868";"We have a winner!"
"115740052-0-14869";"Spikeball!"
"115740052-0-14870";"Please return to the starting line."
"115740052-0-14871";"That might be our best chance to get inside."
"115740052-0-14875";"A moment. This may be crucial."
"115740052-0-14876";"Its people were devoted to Prince Meridia, the radiant one. They lived in peace and assumed themselves safe from any dangers."
"115740052-0-14877";"Where is my meal, woman?"
"115740052-0-14878";"Coming right away, dear. I hope this works."
"115740052-0-14879";"The city's defenders did what they could, but they were no match for Molag Bal's forces. Everyone outside the walls was slaughtered, but the warriors and mages managed to seal the gates to protect those huddled within."
"115740052-0-14880";"The Ayleid King single-handedly protected one of the gates. As he fought, he prayed for assistance. And his prayers were answered."
"115740052-0-14881";"Meridia warded the city and pushed it into Coldharbour. The city arrived intact, but many of its inhabitants were either killed or scattered by this realm's protective spells. Even the Ayleid King was captured."
"115740052-0-14882";"The survivors lost faith, however. One-by-one, they left the safe confines of the city to try to return to Nirn. They were foolish, and they paid the price for rejecting Meridia's edicts."
"115740052-0-14883";"I say that the day has finally arrived! The Great Mage, Vanus Galerion. The Ayleid King. And you, our last, best hope. You must gather your allies and bring them here."
"115740052-0-14885";"Stay away from the eggs, you monster!"
"115740052-0-14887";"It's about time. This better be good!"
"115740052-0-14888";"This tastes … different than usual."
"115740052-0-14889";"A Dominion soldier, in the enclave? We must be more vigilant!"
"115740052-0-14890";"The time of hatching has come. We gather by the boughs of the Hist …."
"115740052-0-14891";"Ah well. We're not picky, are we girls? Fresh meat is good meat, no?\n\nLet's find out how this meat tastes!"
"115740052-0-14892";"Long ago, this city existed in Nirn. It was alive and vibrant and went by a different name."
"115740052-0-14893";"But Meridia has enemies, such as the despicable Molag Bal. The Prince of Murder sent minions from Coldharbour to destroy her beloved city."
"115740052-0-14894";"As fortune would have it, the Ayleid King Laloriaran Dynar was visiting the city. A skilled warrior and tactician, he quickly took command of the city's defenses."
"115740052-0-14895";"Meridia felt compassion for her followers, but she also saw an opportunity. Molag Bal's open portal worked both ways. The time had come to take the battle to Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-14896";"Still, Meridia had accomplished the impossible. She stabbed a dagger into Molag Bal's side. A portion of her realm was in his domain—and he could not touch it."
"115740052-0-14897";"Meridia foresaw a day when an opportunity would arise. An overconfident Molag Bal. Champions from another plane. On that day, this city would become the focal point for the assault against the Lord of Schemes."
"115740052-0-14898";"Mortal weakling! I don't know how you got past my illusions, but it will avail you nothing!"
"115740052-0-14899";"Hah! Guess it still hasn't gotten old. I'll meet you up ahead, at the bustling Pact town of Heartholdhelm!"
"115740052-0-14900";"There's no time. Run!"
"115740052-0-14901";"Return to the void. Return. Return …."
"115740052-0-14902";"You! Hurry up, the Worms are on the move."
"115740052-0-14904";"Go ahead, outsider. Strike the first blow."
"115740052-0-14905";"Good to see you again Halindor. Make sure to check on your wife soon."
"115740052-0-14906";"Look, another one."
"115740052-0-14907";"Amazing these halls remain intact."
"115740052-0-14908";"And still more active constructs."
"115740052-0-14909";"Sithis, exchange my life for the void! Ahhh!"
"115740052-0-14910";"I can't hold back the void for much longer!"
"115740052-0-14911";"Your feet must move, Rahim. Now attack. Attack!"
"115740052-0-14912";"Your sword has not earned its rest yet—it must stay wakeful and swift. Only the bloodied blade deserves the scabbard. Strike!"
"115740052-0-14913";"You must follow through on your swing, my friend. Wide arcs—like the crescent moon."
"115740052-0-14914";"Lift your chin. Shoulders up. Now strike!"
"115740052-0-14915";"That's the last of them, General. The village is clear."
"115740052-0-14916";"An easy victory! Vullain is the first to fall, but there will be more."
"115740052-0-14917";"Now, per the Meat Mandate, let us feast on the fallen."
"115740052-0-14918";"This will require all my concentration. Stay vigilant, yes?"
"115740052-0-14919";"I can hear <<A:1>>. Such … rage!"
"115740052-0-14920";"Wha…? How did you get here so soon? Halindor said they would stop you!"
"115740052-0-14921";"You killed Ifriz, Eilram! What else could there possibly be left to talk about?"
"115740052-0-14923";"Selene blessed them with her gift—the gift of spirit life. See their hunt begin anew!"
"115740052-0-14924";"Gwilir! If you had half a brain in your head, you'd run and hide."
"115740052-0-14925";"Skordo, you're free! By Y'ffre, you don't know how relieved I am to see you."
"115740052-0-14926";"I'm really sorry, Skordo! I didn't mean to cause so much trouble!"
"115740052-0-14927";"You led an army of Daedra right toward us! You ignorant, scatterbrained, sorry excuse for a Wood Elf, weakling!"
"115740052-0-14929";"I'll never do anything like that again! I promise!"
"115740052-0-14930";"Thanks again for your help. Now excuse me while I go find that good-for-nothing Wood Elf and introduce his backside to my very large boot."
"115740052-0-14933";"Help from a Dremora? Why doesn't that reassure me?"
"115740052-0-14934";"Only Blackheart's trusted are allowed in here and you're nothing of the sort. Time to die!"
"115740052-0-14935";"This portal leads to the Hollow City. We shall talk again when we are safely inside its walls."
"115740052-0-14938";"Return to Daggerfall quick as you can, comrade. Sees-All-Colors must know!"
"115740052-0-14939";"Freedom. I remember this feeling. It will be fleeting though, if Molag Bal has his way."
"115740052-0-14943";"Rise my soldiers. Back to your bodies, and take up arms."
"115740052-0-14944";"What have they … no, this cannot be!"
"115740052-0-14946";"Why do you command us from the Ooze?"
"115740052-0-14947";"A powerful one, unknown to me, has stolen my bow."
"115740052-0-14948";"Bark and birth! What have they done?"
"115740052-0-14949";"By your command …."
"115740052-0-14951";"Now your keystone removes the rest of the barrier! See where it fits?"
"115740052-0-14952";"The Dominion …. They'll doom us all!"
"115740052-0-14953";"Sithis, I implore you! Shield our unhatched eggs from the void!"
"115740052-0-14954";"This is where the bodies were rumored to have been condemned and where the General's body lay. It is rumored that he was buried with a bow of unequal value, but his army would protect it for all eternity."
"115740052-0-14955";"Saying a line to my parent."
"115740052-0-14956";"I think that's the last of them!"
"115740052-0-14957";"Poor Cirion. You don't want to play with your fellow Keepers?"
"115740052-0-14958";"They are not Keepers. Not any longer."
"115740052-0-14959";"They selected an intelligent course of action. What better way to keep rickety old Rilis in check than a few Daedra? Ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-14960";"I will find a way to silence you, Rilis. You've become too dangerous to imprison."
"115740052-0-14961";"If you want to silence me, you'll need power like mine. Daedric magic. What is there to fear?\n\nI was a mere Kinlord. You are a Keeper. Surely you can resist corruption where I fell."
"115740052-0-14962";"Stop!"
"115740052-0-14963";"Your oath is to keep me imprisoned, Keeper. What does it matter how you do it?"
"115740052-0-14964";"Be silent."
"115740052-0-14965";"You could accomplish so much. The enemies of Auridon brought low by the power of the Keepers."
"115740052-0-14966";"Were that I could lay my hands on you and choke the life out of you all over again."
"115740052-0-14967";"Eh, you know, he comes and goes … oh yeah, there he is."
"115740052-0-14968";"Cirion's right, of course. The Keepers work for my benefit, now. However, I made sure they still served their sacred stations. They'll fight you to their last breath."
"115740052-0-14969";"You're going to fight your way through all of the Keepers? How amusing! They are stronger than they once were, you know."
"115740052-0-14970";"Keeper Areldur watches the first stone. Let's see if she's learned from me in our time together."
"115740052-0-14971";"Ah. That's much better. I'd say it feels like I regained the use of a limb. If I had any."
"115740052-0-14972";"Merric ran off after some other Daedra. Get after him! Don't let her take him!"
"115740052-0-14973";"Ahaht-Ei! No!"
"115740052-0-14974";"Merric? Comrade? What happened? Where did you go?"
"115740052-0-14975";"That's a perfectly good portal. I should know, I made it!"
"115740052-0-14977";"It was nothing. It was nothing."
"115740052-0-14978";"The Daedra are resisting the ritual! Help me fend off this monster!"
"115740052-0-14979";"They're covered in so much filth, they're starting to grow together. Here, I'll show you."
"115740052-0-14980";"Keep your boots on! We're only here until the eggs hatch."
"115740052-0-14981";"Then the lizards get theirs, and we leave this muckwallow for good."
"115740052-0-14982";"They're almost like the spinners from back home. Couldn't we spare them, sir?"
"115740052-0-14983";"What part of ""no survivors"" don't you understand, private? These savages are the enemy. Once they complete the ritual, they die like the rest."
"115740052-0-14984";"But, sir!"
"115740052-0-14985";"If you're so keen to argue, talk to the Alchemist. It's his order."
"115740052-0-14986";"Sir, I … yes, sir."
"115740052-0-14987";"And remember, try to relax!"
"115740052-0-14988";"Mind what bumps in the night, now!"
"115740052-0-14989";"Remember, vacations are about enjoying the little moments!"
"115740052-0-14990";"Give the old lug my love before you rip his skull open, will you?"
"115740052-0-14991";"Let me help."
"115740052-0-14992";"A near miss! Hurry, join me at the altar so that we can finish the warding ritual."
"115740052-0-14993";"I do so enjoy fire."
"115740052-0-14994";"I'm impressed with the Keepers. It takes a strong will to control a Daedroth of that size. \n\nI wonder what Daedra you could bend to your will."
"115740052-0-14995";"Voranil lies ahead. I never liked him. He hums off-key."
"115740052-0-14996";"How I marvel at your efficiency! You really are quite good at killing Keepers."
"115740052-0-14997";"Give Valaste my best!"
"115740052-0-14998";"Sometimes I like to amuse myself by having my minions tear each other to pieces. The winner gets to keep fighting!"
"115740052-0-14999";"Daedric power is not granted cheaply. The Keepers are paying for their new powers with their service. To me."
"115740052-0-15000";"Much better. Only one stone remains. This is far more entertaining than I thought it would be."
"115740052-0-15001";"I love it when I draw this detail.  The views up here are amazing."
"115740052-0-15002";"I find you so agreeable, in fact, that I simply must meet you in person.\n\nClear a path, gentlemen. Let's entertain our guests."
"115740052-0-15003";"You've faced darkness before, adept. Remember your training."
"115740052-0-15004";"No cheating, Shalidor! Don't ruin this for me."
"115740052-0-15005";"Justice is a swift wind, this day. I will perform rites for the lost ones and return to <<1>>. Thank you."
"115740052-0-15006";"How easily you slaughter Daedra and Keeper alike. How much more powerful could you be made with my gifts? You are fascinating."
"115740052-0-15007";"Hey! Uh - I'm not doing anything!  Just - uhm - tying my boot! Yeah."
"115740052-0-15008";"You would steal that which has already been stolen? Then enter the Shadow Wood and seek it … though you will find only death."
"115740052-0-15010";"Right this way."
"115740052-0-15011";"And please, try not to make a mess of things."
"115740052-0-15012";"Happy adventuring."
"115740052-0-15013";"I will consume you as well!"
"115740052-0-15014";"Ahh … the ebb and swell of magicka. How I missed this."
"115740052-0-15015";"All right, let's get this started. Gol … ro … so … me-aka?"
"115740052-0-15016";"Woo hoo! Take that, you damned Elves. Wait. I just lost my place."
"115740052-0-15017";"Alooo-saba … takeo? Takeeeo? Taco? How do you pronounce this?"
"115740052-0-15018";"All right. I think I've got it! Malla Aloo takeo!"
"115740052-0-15019";"And now my work begins."
"115740052-0-15020";"Strike true, pig child. Don't make me wait."
"115740052-0-15021";"Please! No! Show mercy!"
"115740052-0-15022";"Arkay, protect me. I will be with you soon."
"115740052-0-15023";"No, wait. Please, don't kill me! Show mercy! Mercy!"
"115740052-0-15024";"Tomes! Attend me."
"115740052-0-15025";"Now … I reclaim what was taken from me. Eyevea! Hear my call!"
"115740052-0-15026";"Monsters! You're all monsters! You'll pay for these murders!"
"115740052-0-15027";"Why? Why would you murder him? Barbaric orcs!"
"115740052-0-15028";"Turn back! The Keepers guard this tomb."
"115740052-0-15029";"I'll see you dead before you harm this stone!"
"115740052-0-15030";"Something is wrong. I sense … Adept, Valaste. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-15031";"I never thought I'd be free of you, Blackheart."
"115740052-0-15032";"But the day has finally come, and I'll be rewarded handsomely for this."
"115740052-0-15033";"Raynor? Raynor! He can't hear me. Why can't he hear me? Raynor!"
"115740052-0-15034";"My new master has waited long enough, and I think it's time you died for good.\n\nIt's been fun, Captain. No, it hasn't."
"115740052-0-15035";"If we let it, this darkness could suffocate you. Mage Light will fix that!"
"115740052-0-15036";"Where are you going? The temple is the other way, come back here."
"115740052-0-15037";"Give us the cat, snake, and we'll end your life quickly."
"115740052-0-15038";"Yeah, it's locked. Thought it'd be open, really. Sorry."
"115740052-0-15039";"You fool! I borrowed money to buy this new sword, just because you promised treasure."
"115740052-0-15040";"I'm not sure how much longer I … we … can go on like this. It's unbearable."
"115740052-0-15041";"Leave the outsider alone, warm bloods! You will not harm him!"
"115740052-0-15042";"That chest. Perhaps the fork is in there."
"115740052-0-15043";"Not another memory! My mind is full!"
"115740052-0-15044";"Are you sure we're not wasting our time? How many people has this crystal killed now?"
"115740052-0-15045";"Patience. Rest assured, Ilmyris contains the knowledge that Naemon's Shade will need."
"115740052-0-15046";"No, the roots, they envelop the whole forest … and at the center, such pulsing … augh!"
"115740052-0-15047";"Pulsing. The heart. At last. Let me see."
"115740052-0-15048";"Wait! What are you doing? The crystal will drive you mad!"
"115740052-0-15049";"Magnificent! Such truth, such clarity of sight. Everything leads to Hectahame…."
"115740052-0-15050";"Yes, let's talk about that sword. It's bigger than you are!"
"115740052-0-15051";"Leave it to the Daedra to fill a cave with bones and muck."
"115740052-0-15053";"Maybe if I cut you in half with it, you'd stop laughing."
"115740052-0-15054";"Over here! We need you!"
"115740052-0-15055";"Ha! You try to draw it and you'll fall over. I'm more likely to die of laughter than a sword thrust from you!"
"115740052-0-15056";"You have the brains of mudcrabs. Perhaps the caravan out of Dragonclaw still needs guards."
"115740052-0-15057";"Hey! Wait for us!"
"115740052-0-15058";"Will you hold still? This illusion requires precision, which I cannot achieve with your tail constantly twitching!"
"115740052-0-15059";"My friends, you came just in time. I'm almost done."
"115740052-0-15060";"Your blood will temper my thirst, your bones will end my famine!"
"115740052-0-15061";"Ah, you hear Merric there, at the forge. He has already begun."
"115740052-0-15062";"This Prismatic Weapon could be a powerful force against Molag Bal, yes?"
"115740052-0-15063";"It is a difficult task we undertake today. To hunt a comrade."
"115740052-0-15064";"Seems like we were just here, yes?"
"115740052-0-15065";"Let us summon our old friend. He will know where his murderer hides."
"115740052-0-15066";"Damn it, cat! Can't you let an old ghost be at peace?"
"115740052-0-15067";"Not just yet, old Nord. Aelif has one more question for you. Where is Sees-All-Colors? Where does she hide?"
"115740052-0-15068";"You know I can't … I can't tell you. He holds me bound."
"115740052-0-15069";"Tell Aelif, or she will show you what it means to be bound!"
"115740052-0-15070";"Ah! She … she sought out the Mortuum Vivicus! It's … it's in the Halls of Submission! Don't go comrades, she's …."
"115740052-0-15071";"Enough! Aelif is up to the challenge. But don't worry, Jofnir. She will let Molag Bal know how helpful you've been."
"115740052-0-15072";"Hmm. Very convincing. But is the illusion applied … everywhere? Perhaps this one should take a moment in private to double-check, yes?"
"115740052-0-15073";"There were no miscalulations, I assure you. Now excuse me, I must wash the smell of cat from my robes."
"115740052-0-15076";"<A blaring horn sounds.>"
"115740052-0-15077";"These swords … they must be a clue. Now where did those fools run off to?"
"115740052-0-15078";"So most of the Pact's forces have moved to Fort Amol. I'm glad I can stay here in Windhelm."
"115740052-0-15079";"I'm still not sure how I feel about working alongside the Dark Elves and the lizard folk. Excuse me, the Argonians."
"115740052-0-15080";"King Jorunn wants us all to work together. I hear that Prince Irnskar and the King are heading to Fort Amol shortly."
"115740052-0-15081";"I just heard from Fort Amol. Someone tried to assassinate King Jorunn! Luckily, some stranger saved him."
"115740052-0-15082";"Assassination! Was it one of the Dark Elves? The Argonians? I never trusted them!"
"115740052-0-15083";"It was one of Fildgor's agents. No one from the Pact would do such a thing! King Jorunn lives, but I hear he was poisoned. I pray to the Eight that he recovers."
"115740052-0-15084";"These poor creatures. Just … slaughtered. Nothing ever changes."
"115740052-0-15085";"Help me … destroy … the crystal …."
"115740052-0-15086";"The council has decided we will honor the contract to fight the Daedra. Meridia continues to provide coin through her worldly servants. But we cannot allow a murderer to remain Guildmaster."
"115740052-0-15087";"I understand."
"115740052-0-15088";"We have decided to award you a new title. The Light of the Guild. You will advise the new Guildmaster in all matters relating to the Daedra for the rest of your days. Penance for the blood on your hands."
"115740052-0-15089";"Thank you, Countess. I will not let you down."
"115740052-0-15090";"You are dismissed. Merric, present yourself to the council."
"115740052-0-15091";"Merric at-Aswala. In light of your service to the guild. In light of your sound judgment and brave heart, we cannot think of anyone more appropriate than you. You, Merric, are to be the new Guildmaster of the Fighters Guild."
"115740052-0-15092";"It will be your responsibility to oversee completion of the contract established by Sees-All-Colors."
"115740052-0-15093";"Remain vigilant against the forces of Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-15094";"The Guild is a shield, a bastion for the people of Tamriel. Wear it well."
"115740052-0-15095";"You've been quiet, Merric. What do you have to say about all this?"
"115740052-0-15096";"I … Thank you, council members. I accept this position with honor and grace. I swear to my ancestors, I will not let you down."
"115740052-0-15097";"Now, Guildmaster, please see our friend out. We have much to discuss, and little time in which to plan. Comrade! We wish you well in your travels, and look forward to our next encounter."
"115740052-0-15098";"Come, comrade. You can't do much good hiding in this forge. Let's get you back into the fight!"
"115740052-0-15099";"Sees-All-Colors. Present yourself to the council."
"115740052-0-15100";"Merric at-Aswala. Present yourself to the council."
"115740052-0-15101";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-15102";"A hidden passage. Connected to another section of the Imperial Underground, no doubt. We should investigate."
"115740052-0-15103";"There could be some useful evidence down here. Let us look closely before moving on."
"115740052-0-15104";"Asteril had a sister? A twin, perhaps? That would explain much. Raz suspects these tunnels will reveal the rest."
"115740052-0-15105";"Seems that Voljar's Meadery has been shut down."
"115740052-0-15106";"What? They make the finest mead in Eastmarch. What happened?"
"115740052-0-15107";"No one knows for sure, but Stormfists were seen in the area. The place appears to be shut down."
"115740052-0-15108";"I was just at the Sober Nord, enjoying the newest beverage from Voljar's Meadery."
"115740052-0-15109";"Oh? I thought the place had been closed down."
"115740052-0-15110";"It's open for business again, though now five brothers are running the place."
"115740052-0-15111";"Have you heard? The Stormfists have captured Cradlecrush, an old Orc stronghold."
"115740052-0-15112";"That old place? Next you'll tell me it's raining dogs. Have you been drinking?"
"115740052-0-15113";"Well, yes, I'm always drinking. But I heard that from someone sober."
"115740052-0-15114";"Fildgor's Stormfists no longer hold Cradlecrush. Giants drove them out."
"115740052-0-15115";"Really? That's unusual. Normally the giants keep to themselves."
"115740052-0-15116";"The Stormfist were stupid enough to steal their mammoths. I heard a brave champion helped them defeat Lob the Cleaver to win the day."
"115740052-0-15117";"Keep your eyes open and your weapon ready. The shadows here are not your friend."
"115740052-0-15118";"Onward!"
"115740052-0-15119";"More outsiders! Show them the penalty for entering the Moonless Walk!"
"115740052-0-15120";"Come, outsider! While they are distracted, we shall find a safer place!"
"115740052-0-15121";"You've done it, comrade!"
"115740052-0-15122";"The lizard put you up to this? I'll eat her young!"
"115740052-0-15125";"That door has a barrier? It didn't when I last came through here. Let's look around, there must be a way to disrupt it."
"115740052-0-15127";"Zur told you our friend would find us, Gadris. You worry too much."
"115740052-0-15128";"Zur thinks he saw some dried scathecraw over here … yes, here it is!"
"115740052-0-15129";"Ah, Zur's finest potion yet! You will drink it now, yes?"
"115740052-0-15130";"I will help the Khajiit, Elf! I know the best way into the tower!"
"115740052-0-15131";"Don't be ridiculous, snake! The Khajiit needs expert help, and that means I'm going to provide it."
"115740052-0-15132";"You there, wait! I need to speak to you!"
"115740052-0-15133";"Wait, outsider, a moment more of your time."
"115740052-0-15134";"Leave <<1>> for now. We have to disrupt the summoning ritual! I'll destroy the bone piles if you keep the undead at bay."
"115740052-0-15135";"<<1>>! I'll save you!"
"115740052-0-15136";"Run to the gates! You'll be safe there!"
"115740052-0-15137";"Make a run for the gate. They'll protect you."
"115740052-0-15138";"We're pushing back the Maormer. Run for the gate!"
"115740052-0-15139";"Run to the gates. The guards will protect you."
"115740052-0-15142";"Where are you going?"
"115740052-0-15143";"Bowenas is gone! Someone took her!"
"115740052-0-15144";"This grows more taxing by the hour."
"115740052-0-15145";"We need to activate the sigil-trees."
"115740052-0-15146";"Don't let the clerk know, all right?"
"115740052-0-15147";"She wants to meet me? Now?\n\nOut of my way!"
"115740052-0-15148";"Time for you to leave. I …."
"115740052-0-15149";"<<1>>, murdered? These treacherous Khajiit have plotted with the Maormer to slay our noble envoy!"
"115740052-0-15150";"How dare you! <<1>> was our guest. You go too far, Vicereeve!"
"115740052-0-15151";"Outrageous! More Dominion treachery. I will conduct my own investigation!"
"115740052-0-15152";"No sea-rat will show me up. I'll get to the bottom of this myself!"
"115740052-0-15153";"Speak with me a moment, comrade."
"115740052-0-15154";"Hsst! Quick, over here!"
"115740052-0-15155";"Follow me. The exit is this way."
"115740052-0-15157";"You're too late! The Stonefire burns brightly! The Dro-m'Athra are unbound and they shall destroy you!"
"115740052-0-15158";"These things crawled out of a hole on the western side of the fort."
"115740052-0-15159";"We need to get the barrier up."
"115740052-0-15160";"We need to clear the fort, so we can launch a counter-attack."
"115740052-0-15161";"Commander Sangur is at the last sigil-tree, inside the center cavern."
"115740052-0-15162";"Things don't look good. Let's see if we can help."
"115740052-0-15163";"It pains me to see the forest suffer like this. I can sense the Green itself calling out for vengeance."
"115740052-0-15164";"It'll take a moment to weaken the circle. Keep the undead away from me!"
"115740052-0-15166";"It's working! I'll weaken the next circle."
"115740052-0-15167";"One last circle! We can do this. We must do this!"
"115740052-0-15168";"Our time is now, my children! Swarm forth and reclaim what is ours!"
"115740052-0-15169";"Speak with the Mane. I'll see what I can do to help the injured."
"115740052-0-15170";"Indaenir, stop trying to save everyone! You cleared the tunnel and that is enough. Akkhuz-ri will return to Marbruk and send reinforcements here."
"115740052-0-15171";"Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the Summoner Arena, and the qualifying rounds of the Summoner Division Championship!"
"115740052-0-15172";"Our first challenger, from parts unknown, the enigmatic, the inscrutable, the dangerous … Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15173";"Facing off against the Beast from the East! The Ladykiller! The Heartbreaker! The one, the only …"
"115740052-0-15174";"Jawsnap!"
"115740052-0-15175";"And Jawsnap goes down! The Mysterious Stranger goes on to Round Two!"
"115740052-0-15176";"You will die and then rise again to serve me!"
"115740052-0-15177";"Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-15178";"You must be the Tharn's contact?"
"115740052-0-15179";"<<1>>, I command you! By the <<2>>, return to your prison!"
"115740052-0-15180";"Ahh! That won't hold me for long!"
"115740052-0-15181";"Lizards set … lizards ready …!"
"115740052-0-15182";"And now, for round two!"
"115740052-0-15183";"She's stronger than an Ansei Ward and swifter than a desert sandstorm!"
"115740052-0-15184";"The Princess of the Pack! The Warrior of the Wolves! You know her! You love her!"
"115740052-0-15185";"Serit the Sensational!"
"115740052-0-15186";"Serit the Sensational is no more! The Mysterious Stranger moves on to Round Three!"
"115740052-0-15187";"Go!"
"115740052-0-15188";"The <<1>> wins!"
"115740052-0-15189";"The <<1>> wins!"
"115740052-0-15190";"The <<1>> wins!"
"115740052-0-15191";"Nice work!"
"115740052-0-15192";"Ezreba understands. She will be going now, never to return."
"115740052-0-15193";"Now to wake him up. Smelling salts should do the trick."
"115740052-0-15194";"What … what happened? Who are you?"
"115740052-0-15196";"Another word and you're dead. Get up."
"115740052-0-15197";"Master, I know what you're planning. I won't let you throw your life away!"
"115740052-0-15198";"This is your escort. Follow them, and don't speak."
"115740052-0-15199";"You won't see me, but I'll be watching. Try anything and you'll be the first to die."
"115740052-0-15200";"Nod if you understand me."
"115740052-0-15201";"Such a good boy!"
"115740052-0-15202";"He's all yours! I'll go on ahead, but I'll be nearby."
"115740052-0-15204";"<<1>>, I beg you to reconsider."
"115740052-0-15205";"You're too important, <<1>>. If the Dominion lost you, we would be lost."
"115740052-0-15206";"Then I'll recover the Mourning Stone. Farewell, my dearest friend."
"115740052-0-15207";"Farewell, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-15208";"You've interfered for the last time. Now I will end you!"
"115740052-0-15209";"Now become one of us."
"115740052-0-15210";"Can the Mysterious Stranger remain undefeated? Let's start round three and find out!"
"115740052-0-15211";"Our next challenger, from the highest reaches of Elden Root …."
"115740052-0-15212";"Master of Mayhem! Baron of Beasts!"
"115740052-0-15213";"The Diabolical Demon of Darkness … Doradrin!"
"115740052-0-15214";"And Doradin is dominated! And that means our qualifying champion for the Summoner Division, moving on to the main arena, is—the Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15215";"I've heard enough."
"115740052-0-15216";"His orders! Had to follow his orders!"
"115740052-0-15217";"There, there. You did what you had to."
"115740052-0-15218";"As did I."
"115740052-0-15219";"Finally, our children are avenged."
"115740052-0-15220";"You can't do this, master."
"115740052-0-15221";"The Dominion will thrive without me. It's far stronger than it knows."
"115740052-0-15222";"The tempest is coming. You cannot stop it!"
"115740052-0-15223";"Good. You've arrived."
"115740052-0-15224";"Sea-rat coward! I'll have your head for this!"
"115740052-0-15225";"Welcome, Centurion Gavo. Right this way."
"115740052-0-15226";"I have his scent. And soon, his heart."
"115740052-0-15227";"Stop, all of you! This madness ends now!"
"115740052-0-15228";"Then I should recover the Mourning Stone. Farewell, <<1>>. I …."
"115740052-0-15229";"I know, <<1>>. I know."
"115740052-0-15230";"Excellent! Bring the crystal with you. You will need it to free me from my bonds."
"115740052-0-15231";"All right, I have my gear. Let's go."
"115740052-0-15232";"No! Gods' mercy, stay back!"
"115740052-0-15233";"The gods can't hear you. Scream louder."
"115740052-0-15234";"Keep her away from me."
"115740052-0-15236";"Sorry I was delayed. It was harder to get rid of Tzik'nith than I thought it would be."
"115740052-0-15237";"I wasn't sure the illusion would last long enough to make it across the chamber, but it did."
"115740052-0-15238";"As the end approaches, this one must admit that he will miss our time together."
"115740052-0-15239";"This wave of the Hollow are beaten. Report to Commander Sangur at the northern end of the fort."
"115740052-0-15241";"I will see my falllen brothers and sister avenged even if it the last thing I ever do."
"115740052-0-15242";"My father has been chief of the tribe for twenty-six years. We would not know what to do without him."
"115740052-0-15243";"Who would have believed the Withered Hand would poison our water?"
"115740052-0-15244";"We must hurry. So many Ash'abah have already died."
"115740052-0-15245";"That's everything. Meet me at my father's tent."
"115740052-0-15246";"Tell us what you're doing here. Who is behind the attack on Arenthia?"
"115740052-0-15247";"The truth, Centurion. Or your life."
"115740052-0-15248";"We are in league with the Stonefire cult."
"115740052-0-15249";"The cultists are here. They are hidden behind the walls of the temple district."
"115740052-0-15250";"They're performing a ritual. Preparing the way for a dark anchor."
"115740052-0-15251";"They work to the dark orders of Javad Tharn, the necromancer."
"115740052-0-15252";"Just what we needed."
"115740052-0-15253";"<<1>>, my master was a fool to doubt your power. I'll help you wreak the vengeance you seek, if you allow me."
"115740052-0-15254";"Such a spectacular, willing garment! Very well."
"115740052-0-15255";"I can't fight him for long! Quickly, place the <<1>> in the pedestals!"
"115740052-0-15256";"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!"
"115740052-0-15257";"I've reconsidered what our combined power could do, <<1>>. I willingly give myself over."
"115740052-0-15258";"I knew such power would tempt you! Very well."
"115740052-0-15259";"Hurry! Place the <<1>> in the pedestals!"
"115740052-0-15260";"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!"
"115740052-0-15261";"Ready!"
"115740052-0-15262";"Fight!"
"115740052-0-15263";"<<1>> wins!"
"115740052-0-15264";"<<1>> wins!"
"115740052-0-15266";"Hey! A little help here!"
"115740052-0-15267";"Are you all right? I was sent by the Mages Guild to help."
"115740052-0-15268";"Please, Father! There must be some way!"
"115740052-0-15269";"I know. I'm the one who sent for you. Did me a whole lot of good."
"115740052-0-15270";"The Vestige awakens, once again. Come here, we must speak."
"115740052-0-15271";"You must accept this, Talia. My time has come. Go … prepare the potion. I must speak with our guest."
"115740052-0-15272";"I do not like this, but I will do as you say, Father."
"115740052-0-15273";"You cannot stop the Shadow Wood. It is an inevitability."
"115740052-0-15274";"Leave the shadow rifts alone, or you will suffer for it."
"115740052-0-15275";"Desist, living one! You meddle with forces you cannot understand."
"115740052-0-15276";"You go too far. Now you will experience the Shadow Wood for yourself!"
"115740052-0-15277";"You! I won't wear a poisoned outfit."
"115740052-0-15278";"Leave it to an Altmer to grasp for power and sow disaster. I would have been able to keep these Daedra under control.\n\nIf these shaveskins have harmed my sister, I will unclaw them."
"115740052-0-15279";"This one knew she was alive! Bakkhara is close, I have her scent. This will be easier than I thought.\n\nPerhaps I can save my sister and return home with a cadre of Daedric servants, as well."
"115740052-0-15280";"Look at all these Daedra. They would be a force to be reckoned with under the banner of the Mages Guild …."
"115740052-0-15284";"My sister's scent ends here, at this portal. The altar that keeps it open must just be beyond. You stay here."
"115740052-0-15285";"Come closer."
"115740052-0-15286";"Look what they've done to our home! Rip them apart!"
"115740052-0-15287";"Sameer … Sameer … rouse yourself! Or do you want to miss the battle?"
"115740052-0-15288";"Bera, notify the guild council. Tell them we'll meet them here upon our return."
"115740052-0-15289";"Ra Gada! You all know that the Elves are outside our walls. These … infidels call us barbarians. They would drive us from this land."
"115740052-0-15290";"But what the Elves do not know … is that Ruptga himself guided us to these shores! He decreed that the Alik'r would be our home!"
"115740052-0-15291";"Today, the infidels will see the strength of the Shehai! Onsi will guide our blades! Today, the sands will run red with Elven blood!"
"115740052-0-15292";"An impressive tactic."
"115740052-0-15293";"More constructs!"
"115740052-0-15294";"Surely, this must be the last."
"115740052-0-15295";"An Auroran? Here?"
"115740052-0-15296";"Order's up, Gil!"
"115740052-0-15297";"Do you need anything, Salori?"
"115740052-0-15298";"Halt! Come no closer!"
"115740052-0-15299";"I'm fine. Just reading."
"115740052-0-15300";"Sure thing. Call me if you need me."
"115740052-0-15301";"Are you still waiting?"
"115740052-0-15302";"Yes. She's late as usual. Can I get some more water?"
"115740052-0-15303";"Certainly. Be right back."
"115740052-0-15304";"Then let us not keep him waiting."
"115740052-0-15305";"How's everyone doing over here?"
"115740052-0-15306";"Pork for me and another drink for Riahl. And a new personality for Blodrat, please!"
"115740052-0-15307";"I will fight today in your honor, father."
"115740052-0-15308";"Ah, much better! Now, follow me out of this foul place! Then we can talk."
"115740052-0-15309";"You'll make it out of here, I know you will."
"115740052-0-15310";"Food and drink coming right up. Can't help Blodrat though."
"115740052-0-15311";"Keep up the jokes, Farisel. You'll be wearing that chair soon."
"115740052-0-15312";"There's only one more chamber where they could be hiding my son. The fight will be bloody. You all served me well, my friends. If you leave now, I will think no less of you."
"115740052-0-15313";"Come on, boss, you think we'd really walk out on you now? Who knows? Dying might be an adventure! Right, Faulor?"
"115740052-0-15314";"We all love At'avar. Everything between him and us dies."
"115740052-0-15315";"Thank you my friends. And you, outsiders, I already owe too much. But I hope you'll join us for this last push."
"115740052-0-15316";"Finally! <<1>> will find this fabled brush."
"115740052-0-15317";"I'm goin' out!"
"115740052-0-15318";"What? What is this?"
"115740052-0-15319";"Hmm, you have such intricate stitching …."
"115740052-0-15320";"Please, no! This one will stop looking!"
"115740052-0-15321";"I tire of this. Leave or die, it matters not."
"115740052-0-15322";"That can't be good. We need to get those wards down, fast!"
"115740052-0-15323";"<A distant war horn sounds.>"
"115740052-0-15325";"A little less noticeable now. Follow me."
"115740052-0-15326";"Go, help my master! I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-15327";"<<1>>! Get out of my body, now!"
"115740052-0-15328";"Silence! None command <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-15329";"Stay back!"
"115740052-0-15330";"The champion is dead! Let's return to the camp where your friend was killed. There's a portal stone there that we can use to reach the council."
"115740052-0-15331";"Great rescue, but now what? Do you have a plan or are we making this up as we go along?"
"115740052-0-15332";"You've had enough, Verene. Time for you to go."
"115740052-0-15333";"All right. I'm leavin'. Be back later."
"115740052-0-15334";"See you there!"
"115740052-0-15335";"I'll return shortly. You'll be safe here, I promise. Why not get to know a few of these Shadow Walkers while I'm gone."
"115740052-0-15338";"Can't make it up ladder. Goin' to sleep on floor."
"115740052-0-15343";"Good news! The council has agreed to meet with you!"
"115740052-0-15344";"At last! This book had best be worth the price."
"115740052-0-15345";"We would have been if that stranger hadn't arrived. Honestly, what good is a town guard if they refuse to protect their people?"
"115740052-0-15346";"Their ancestors were eating people, Firouz! Gods you're naive!"
"115740052-0-15347";"They were protecting the people - our honored dead deserve to be guarded just as we do.  Would you have the soldiers cut down their ancestors like jackals?"
"115740052-0-15348";"By Tava's red feathers, I thought we were going to be overrun."
"115740052-0-15349";"We shouldn't go outdoors, Firouz. The dead may have already reached the city."
"115740052-0-15350";"We would have heard something. They make a noise. Its… I do not even want to think about it."
"115740052-0-15351";"If we move quickly, we might be able to make it to Farrokh's house."
"115740052-0-15352";"Sometimes blessings aren't enough, Bahbiq."
"115740052-0-15353";"I do not understand.  The vault was thrice-blessed by Ruptga."
"115740052-0-15354";"Amen."
"115740052-0-15355";"To Oblivion with this Withered Hand! Dogs and sons of dogs, all of them."
"115740052-0-15356";"Well may this blessing carry: Tall Papa, watch over Fahara'jad's champion, and may all his enemies eat sand."
"115740052-0-15357";"My father would not want us to surrender!"
"115740052-0-15358";"What? What is that?"
"115740052-0-15359";"Keep to your feet."
"115740052-0-15360";"Wait! I only wanted to make something beautiful!"
"115740052-0-15361";"At'avar! Wake up! Wake up!"
"115740052-0-15362";"I don't like this."
"115740052-0-15363";"Have to agree with the elf, boss. There's some serious magic here. This place screams 'ambush'."
"115740052-0-15364";"Ambush. What a lovely idea."
"115740052-0-15365";"Whew! Harder than expected. Let's see if it was worth it."
"115740052-0-15367";"Gods be good. I'm saved."
"115740052-0-15368";"Come quickly then. Meet me at my tent in the camp!"
"115740052-0-15369";"Not now. Not ever!"
"115740052-0-15370";"Here. I've marked on your map where my father says we can find the ingredients. Lead the way!"
"115740052-0-15371";"Now you die, mortal!"
"115740052-0-15372";"We should discuss this, Sameer. Come with me."
"115740052-0-15373";"I will strike him down. It is my duty."
"115740052-0-15374";"Your sacrifice will be remembered, brother."
"115740052-0-15375";"Welcome to the Arenthia resistance!"
"115740052-0-15376";"Death to the living!"
"115740052-0-15377";"People of Arenthia, do not fear us."
"115740052-0-15379";"Don't be. True honor need not be named. Goodbye, brother."
"115740052-0-15380";"Comply with the instructions of my officers and you will be treated fairly."
"115740052-0-15381";"We have no wish to harm you, and look forward to the day where we are all equals."
"115740052-0-15382";"But do not doubt our resolve. We are committed, and we are not going anywhere."
"115740052-0-15383";"I dread this task, but I will do it for our people."
"115740052-0-15385";"<You hear sounds of battle.>"
"115740052-0-15387";"Haqmir! Haqmir! What is going on? What is happening?"
"115740052-0-15388";"You traitorous bastard!"
"115740052-0-15389";"I will hang your face in Bramblebreach for all to see."
"115740052-0-15390";"I must win!"
"115740052-0-15391";"Then you must be exiled. I'm sorry, brother."
"115740052-0-15392";"Don't be sorry. True honor need not be named. Goodbye, my brother."
"115740052-0-15395";"Die traitor!"
"115740052-0-15396";"I'll make leather out of you!"
"115740052-0-15397";"Why, a glimpse of your enemy: <<1>> and his prize."
"115740052-0-15398";"Then gaze upon your doom: Ruuvitar and his prize! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-15399";"A moment, my mortal trifle. Come close. I have one last secret to whisper in your ear."
"115740052-0-15400";"That's her! It's the lying spirit!"
"115740052-0-15401";"Welcome back to Thizzrini Arena for the Final Rounds of the Swordmaster Division Championship!"
"115740052-0-15402";"You're too late. The dark anchor shall be created!"
"115740052-0-15403";"The base is almost ready."
"115740052-0-15404";"Only the ritual remains."
"115740052-0-15405";"Excellent. Javad will be pleased."
"115740052-0-15406";"Welcome our challenger! From parts unknown, the enigmatic, the inscrutable, the dangerous … Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15407";"I know you will be victorious, my son. May Onsi guide your blade!"
"115740052-0-15408";"That was for Saronor, bitch! Ahem. Search the house. I'll get rid of … this."
"115740052-0-15409";"And our first combatant … the dashing and talented … Sir Harin!"
"115740052-0-15411";"Give me a moment, Sameer. I must make my offering to Onsi. Come to my tent when you are ready to enter the battle."
"115740052-0-15412";"Off limits. You aren't getting through."
"115740052-0-15413";"Sir Harin has been defeated! The Mysterious Stranger takes Round One!"
"115740052-0-15414";"Now, the moment you've been waiting for! She'll dice you with a smile, and stab you with a smirk!"
"115740052-0-15415";"Our own Swordmaster Champion, the lovely Zara!"
"115740052-0-15416";"Zara has been defeated! And the new champion of the Swordmaster Division is … the Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15417";"If you'll follow me, I'll give you your prize."
"115740052-0-15418";"I found something behind the house! Meet me back there!"
"115740052-0-15422";"My work here is done. I must now attend to my cousin."
"115740052-0-15423";"I'll lead you in. Just need a second to change."
"115740052-0-15424";"What do you mean there's no room?"
"115740052-0-15425";"Just what I said. There's no more room."
"115740052-0-15426";"You've got room for that drunken wench but not for an honest Orc?"
"115740052-0-15427";"Go try your luck at the Oak and Crosier. I've got no room here, for Orcs or anyone else."
"115740052-0-15428";"Ladies and gentlemen, creatures and beasts, constructs of all types! Welcome to the Summoner Division main event!"
"115740052-0-15429";"Today, a double feature of blood and brawn!"
"115740052-0-15430";"Our challenger, from parts unknown, the enigmatic, the inscrutable, the dangerous … Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15431";"By chance, or by destiny, I found him while braving the frigid wastes of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-15432";"Welcome the Colossus of Winterhold! The Titan of Terror! The one and only … Wallbreaker!"
"115740052-0-15433";"The Bane of Winterhold has fallen!"
"115740052-0-15434";"But is the Mysterious Stranger prepared for what's next?"
"115740052-0-15435";"Just follow me, my dear."
"115740052-0-15436";"After … after you!"
"115740052-0-15437";"Wow … you're … really tall!"
"115740052-0-15439";"Your powers wane, fool. Keep control of this shell! You will need it to destroy the Lunar Champions."
"115740052-0-15440";"Now an intruder has breached the temple. Destroy them. Do not fail me!"
"115740052-0-15442";"A lovely compliment from a lovely woman. I heard you might like some company. Spend some time with me?"
"115740052-0-15443";"I … I can't. I'm on duty."
"115740052-0-15444";"But you have come to <<1>>, lovely woman! You deserve a chance to relax!"
"115740052-0-15445";"Oh … umm. I am at Pa'alat, after all …."
"115740052-0-15446";"Welcome to the Final Rounds of the Sorcerer Division Championship!"
"115740052-0-15447";"Presenting our challenger, from parts unknown! The enigmatic, the inscrutable, the dangerous … Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15448";"And our first combatant, a merciless mage with the power of ice magic at his fingertips, accompanied by a calculating cadre of cunning companions!"
"115740052-0-15449";"May I present … Irgun the Icemage!"
"115740052-0-15450";"Let the battle begin!"
"115740052-0-15453";"Darkness awaits you!"
"115740052-0-15454";"Tell Sangur the barriers are up and I'm headed to the Hollow's lair."
"115740052-0-15455";"Oh, good. A guard. And I thought this was going to be boring."
"115740052-0-15456";"Excellent! Head down to the holding cells and free my companions. I'll guard our way out of here."
"115740052-0-15457";"Please … I can't take any more."
"115740052-0-15458";"This one knew the vessel was weak."
"115740052-0-15459";"The Tharn will be displeased."
"115740052-0-15460";"End this flesh before you. It is not fit to breathe."
"115740052-0-15461";"Gah—ah!"
"115740052-0-15462";"We will meet again."
"115740052-0-15463";"No more lives need to end. It is up to you."
"115740052-0-15464";"You want me to disband the Shadow Watch? Never."
"115740052-0-15465";"The Shadow Watch has grown too powerful and too aggressive."
"115740052-0-15466";"Too aggressive? You haven't seen aggressive. We will cut down every last one of you!"
"115740052-0-15467";"Light it up."
"115740052-0-15468";"They cast a shield spell on the gate! We're trapped!"
"115740052-0-15469";"We'll deal with the gate. Just keep them away from us until we're done."
"115740052-0-15470";"You've been judged and found wanting, Xiven!"
"115740052-0-15471";"Enough fun and games. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-15472";"No. No!"
"115740052-0-15473";"Irgun has been defeated!"
"115740052-0-15474";"Well done. Let's get in there."
"115740052-0-15475";"Now on to our final round!"
"115740052-0-15476";"And now, the scintillating sorceress from Solitude!"
"115740052-0-15477";"The magical maelstrom of malevolence!"
"115740052-0-15478";"Our very own … Malarel the Magnificent!"
"115740052-0-15479";"Locked. Must be a key around here somewhere."
"115740052-0-15480";"The outsider has come, An-Jeen-Sakka, just as the Hist tree foretold. Perhaps now we can finally settle our disputes and do what is best for the Hist and for Nirn itself."
"115740052-0-15481";"And the new champion of the Sorcerer Division is … the Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15482";"Malarel, why don't you call one of your friends to help you? I'll allow it."
"115740052-0-15484";"We're out of time! The Daedra have broken out of Ilmyris!"
"115740052-0-15485";"Our defending champion needs no introduction!"
"115740052-0-15486";"He's one of our own! A summoner, a charmer, a wrangler, and the fiercest of warriors!"
"115740052-0-15487";"Without further ado, Thizzrini Arena's own Master Summoner and champion …"
"115740052-0-15488";"Tholbor the Thunderous!"
"115740052-0-15489";"Shoo! Get off my family's land!"
"115740052-0-15490";"Divines bless you! Those chains really hurt."
"115740052-0-15491";"That's the spirit! Follow me."
"115740052-0-15492";"Look at the treasures he's collected … perhaps the fork is here as well?"
"115740052-0-15493";"Old Korthor's set up an ice barrier … hmm."
"115740052-0-15494";"There, the ice barrier is down. We can get through!"
"115740052-0-15495";"On my way!"
"115740052-0-15496";"And now, the final contender in the qualifying rounds of the Sorcerer Division Championship!"
"115740052-0-15497";"She hails from darkest Valenwood!"
"115740052-0-15498";"The Mistress of Malice! The Princess of Pain!"
"115740052-0-15499";"The one and only … Einnel!"
"115740052-0-15500";"Einnel has been defeated! And the Mysterious Stranger moves on to the Sorcerer Division Finals in the main arena!"
"115740052-0-15501";"Hey! Is someone up there? Help me! Please!"
"115740052-0-15502";"Be right there!"
"115740052-0-15503";"We have heard enough. Use the portal and return to my daughter's side. You have given us much to discuss, outsider."
"115740052-0-15504";"Welcome one and all, to the qualifying rounds of the Sorcerer Division Championship!"
"115740052-0-15505";"The challenger, from parts unknown! The enigmatic! The inscrutable! The dangerous! Say hello to … The Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15506";"Our first contender hails from war-torn Cyrodiil! A deserter from the Colovian army! A former member of the feared Alpha Division!"
"115740052-0-15507";"The Imperial Inquisitor himself … Ravius!"
"115740052-0-15508";"Ravius falls to the Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15509";"And now, Round Two!"
"115740052-0-15510";"The next combatant, a mystical mer of unknown origin!"
"115740052-0-15511";"He claims to come from a subterranean realm in the depths of Nirn itself!"
"115740052-0-15512";"Here he is, folks … Norirtil the Nefarious!"
"115740052-0-15513";"Norirtil will be returned to the earth from which he came!"
"115740052-0-15514";"Then we leave our brother with the truth, flesh-walker."
"115740052-0-15516";"Who dares disturb my slumber?"
"115740052-0-15517";"You'll never best my generals!"
"115740052-0-15518";"A lucky feat, mortal. The staff is still mine."
"115740052-0-15519";"Insect! You will never hold the staff. Never!"
"115740052-0-15520";"The staff is mine!"
"115740052-0-15521";"My my, you people certainly are eager to die …."
"115740052-0-15522";"My life for Maleel!"
"115740052-0-15523";"You'll never reach Maleel!"
"115740052-0-15524";"You've already lost! While you charged in, we went behind and killed your king! Ha!"
"115740052-0-15525";"Someone's inside. They said this place would be deserted!"
"115740052-0-15526";"No one here. Perfect."
"115740052-0-15527";"As good a place as any. If that clerk has any sense, he'll find it."
"115740052-0-15531";"Been looking forward to this all … who in Oblivion are you?"
"115740052-0-15532";"You have been judged! You won't escape!"
"115740052-0-15533";"I'll execute you myself!"
"115740052-0-15534";"So, why do we even have a Mages Guild here?"
"115740052-0-15535";"The king thinks it's important, I suppose … keeping up appearances for the rest of the Covenant."
"115740052-0-15536";"Is it true what people say? About the banekin dancing atop the tower at night?"
"115740052-0-15537";"I heard there's a High Elf in there who eats nothing but fire salts all day long."
"115740052-0-15538";"Our deeds today will be remembered for generations to come, brother. Lead on!"
"115740052-0-15539";"Morwha's bosom! Let us give the tower a wide berth, shall we?"
"115740052-0-15540";"I'm afraid so. My brother said he saw a man turned into a monkey just by walking in the tower's shadow."
"115740052-0-15541";"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Swordmaster Arena and the qualifying rounds of the Swordmaster Division Championships!"
"115740052-0-15542";"Our first challenger, from parts unknown, the enigmatic, the inscrutable, the dangerous … Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15543";"And all the way from Daggerfall, the Sabre of Salvation! The Cutlass of Caring! Here he is … Mirten!"
"115740052-0-15544";"Mirten has fallen! The Mysterious Stranger has taken Round One!"
"115740052-0-15545";"And now, on to Round Two!"
"115740052-0-15546";"Our next contender was once expelled from the Vinedusk Rangers for her overzealous ferocity!"
"115740052-0-15547";"You may know her as the Lightning Knife, the Shocking Striker, or the Thunderbug!"
"115740052-0-15548";"But we know her as … Thael the Impaler!"
"115740052-0-15549";"Thael the Impaler has been eliminated!"
"115740052-0-15550";"Did you hear that? They must have gone through the crypt! Quickly! We must stop them!"
"115740052-0-15551";"And now. The third and final qualification round!"
"115740052-0-15552";"Our next challenger is a fearsome opponent from Rawl'kha!"
"115740052-0-15553";"Her blade may appear blunt, but it is heavy enough to sever limbs from torsos!"
"115740052-0-15554";"This must be the source of the Daedra. You must stop it, whatever it is. Bakkhara's claws have been unsharpened."
"115740052-0-15555";"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you … Rayfa the Reaper!"
"115740052-0-15556";"Rayfa is down! We have a new challenger for the main arena! The Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15557";"You mentioned Dwemer ruins in your message. Where might they be?"
"115740052-0-15558";"Further down the tunnels, beyond the door. That's where the kwama first broke through."
"115740052-0-15559";"We have to get there. I'd like to see those ruins."
"115740052-0-15560";"My son … you failed me. Now, you will die!"
"115740052-0-15561";"Another sacrifice? How delicious. Let's see if you're strong enough to become one of my pet thralls."
"115740052-0-15562";"Please … hurry … one of us must be saved …."
"115740052-0-15563";"Pack your things, wife. We are going back to Bergama."
"115740052-0-15564";"But my husband, we have just arrived! I cannot bear another journey across the sands so near to the birth."
"115740052-0-15565";"We have no choice, my love. Ra-Netu are emerging from the waves. We aren't safe here."
"115740052-0-15566";"Tu'whacca preserve us."
"115740052-0-15567";"Peace, Jalinah. Save your tears to water our grapes. Now quickly, prepare your things."
"115740052-0-15568";"The lighting—it burns! Keep away from me!"
"115740052-0-15570";"Ah, there you are. I'm glad this works. I have good news for you."
"115740052-0-15575";"Amazing! Do you know what this is? This is Rkugamz!"
"115740052-0-15576";"Give me a minute to catch my breath."
"115740052-0-15582";"Hey! Stranger! Come here. I may be able to help you."
"115740052-0-15585";"You think you can steal from the Crosstree Bandits?"
"115740052-0-15586";"Walk away. The Crosstree Bandits won't stand for competition."
"115740052-0-15587";"By the Divines, what is that noise?"
"115740052-0-15588";"Why would they attack us? Don't they know we're here to help?"
"115740052-0-15589";"Something has altered these kwama. I've never seen anything like it. They're as aggressive as the miners …."
"115740052-0-15590";"We are doomed if we stay here."
"115740052-0-15591";"Spirits? Bah."
"115740052-0-15592";"Ladies and gentlemen. Fiends and friends. We now present the main event!"
"115740052-0-15593";"No doubt, you've heard our contender's name mentioned with awe and respect. The Mysterious Stranger, champion of all three arena divisions, has issued a challenge to duel for the Grand Championship!"
"115740052-0-15594";"I am excited to announce that this challenge has been accepted by the reigning champion!"
"115740052-0-15595";"Without further ado, here to defend her title as the Grand Champion of Thizzrini Arena …!"
"115740052-0-15596";"Please give a warm welcome to … Ishalga, the Queen of Pain!"
"115740052-0-15597";"Sweet Mara, look at them … someone's going to have to fight through that."
"115740052-0-15598";"Your winning streak is over! Ishalga will paint these walls with your blood!"
"115740052-0-15599";"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new Grand Champion! Give a big cheer for … The Mysterious Stranger!"
"115740052-0-15600";"You're too late."
"115740052-0-15601";"Now, quickly, destroy the crown. Place it in the furnace. Burn that abomination. For the Queen and the Dominion!"
"115740052-0-15602";"I'll require accomodations for myself and my aide. You'll provide them, of course?"
"115740052-0-15603";"Erm … that will not be necessary. Khajiiti fare is too … cultural for my palate."
"115740052-0-15604";"Naturally. Will you be dining with us, as well?"
"115740052-0-15605";"If we kill the challenger, Ishalga said we can keep the skooma. It's worth a fortune!"
"115740052-0-15606";"There they are! Get them!"
"115740052-0-15607";"I told you!"
"115740052-0-15608";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-15609";"I'll burn down the forest! You hear me spirits?"
"115740052-0-15610";"No! Let us go. I'll lead my tribe back to Shrouded Vale!"
"115740052-0-15611";"I'm being foolish…"
"115740052-0-15612";"You there, come here."
"115740052-0-15613";"We did not expect you so soon, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-15614";"One must arrive early to see the truth of things."
"115740052-0-15615";"The truth? But we have nothing to hide, Inspector."
"115740052-0-15616";"I hear that often, Clan Mother. Far too often."
"115740052-0-15617";"The great storm was not kind to us. Still, we have the matter in hand."
"115740052-0-15618";"I can't help but notice the abundance of vermin about, Clan Mother."
"115740052-0-15619";"Do you?"
"115740052-0-15620";"Indeed, we brought in a specialist. This one assures you, Inspector, the matter will be resolved shortly."
"115740052-0-15621";"Will you be staying with us long, Inspector?"
"115740052-0-15622";"As long as necessary. One can only tolerate so much fresh air."
"115740052-0-15623";"Truly? Then we'll endeavor to make your stay comfortable."
"115740052-0-15624";"Don't fret overmuch. If my duty requires it, I can tolerate such … rustic accomodations."
"115740052-0-15625";"I'm telling the others!"
"115740052-0-15626";"Clan Mother, tell me your thoughts on the skooma trade."
"115740052-0-15627";"Moon-sugar is more than a spice, to some of us. Using it to brew skooma is an abomination."
"115740052-0-15628";"Then you would have no idea who might supply such an operation …?"
"115740052-0-15629";"None in this one's employ. We want nothing to do with skooma, Inspector. If we learn any of our customers brew the stuff, you'll be the first to know."
"115740052-0-15630";"How was your voyage to our island? You arrived before the great storm, yes?"
"115740052-0-15631";"Yes, we arrived in Mistral before it struck. I understand the rest of the fleet was not so lucky."
"115740052-0-15632";"My condolences, Inspector. Khenarthi's price is not always so high. We can only hope she'll return some of those she has taken."
"115740052-0-15633";"Place the crystal into the machine. Then insert an antipodal rod into each pillar to start the unmelding process."
"115740052-0-15634";"One Daedric portal closed, as promised! Now that's how to do it … with style!"
"115740052-0-15635";"Kargand! You live, yes?"
"115740052-0-15636";"The Withered Hand sent me here to die. I'm quitting."
"115740052-0-15638";"Coming!"
"115740052-0-15639";"<<1>> offers his deepest thanks for saving him."
"115740052-0-15641";"<<1>> is free! Thank you, walker!"
"115740052-0-15644";"I heard the Maormer talking about calling beasts from the sea!"
"115740052-0-15645";"There's no question, <<1>>. Your specialist certainly showed the vermin their place."
"115740052-0-15646";"Of course, Inspector. We could expect nothing less of our specialists!"
"115740052-0-15647";"<<1>>, make a note. ""Unorthodox methods, but vermin-free."""
"115740052-0-15648";"There's no change, auntie. The sickness is spreading."
"115740052-0-15649";"Sir."
"115740052-0-15650";"Tell me, Clan Mother. Wherever did you find this specialist of yours?"
"115740052-0-15651";"Rajhin's own luck, Inspector. As though ja-Kha'jay provided us with the one we most needed."
"115740052-0-15652";"Tell the spinner she must do something. It can't spread to the plantation!"
"115740052-0-15653";"She's doing all she can. I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-15654";"Quaint. Might I suggest a more rigorous selection process? Freelancers are not always so … competent."
"115740052-0-15655";"As you can see, vermin aren't tolerated at <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-15656";"A spectacular display. If all your hirelings are as capable as your specialist, you've no need to worry."
"115740052-0-15657";"This one is delighted by your words, Inspector."
"115740052-0-15658";"I said ""if,"" Clan Mother."
"115740052-0-15659";"Ah, more mortal blood! And what experiment shall I subject you to, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-15660";"Now that my strength has returned, I can open a portal to the Hollow City."
"115740052-0-15661";"This portal will only remain open for a few minutes. I hope to see you again in the Hollow City."
"115740052-0-15662";"The nightmare is over Kargand. Rest."
"115740052-0-15663";"This one is strong enough to open a portal now. We shall go to this Hollow City Zur has heard so much about."
"115740052-0-15664";"The portal shall remain open for only a few minutes, my friend. Zur hopes to see you again in the Hollow City."
"115740052-0-15665";"Soldier, look after these people. Once they're settled, report back to <<1>>."
"115740052-0-15666";"This poison causes nothing but pain!"
"115740052-0-15667";"I am here, sister."
"115740052-0-15668";"There's a trick to getting into the gatehouse proper, but for the life of me I can't remember what it is. Not to worry, though. I'm sure it will come back to me."
"115740052-0-15669";"It's all coming back to me! There's a lever across the chamber. Just give it a good tug and that flywheel will be spinning in no time."
"115740052-0-15670";"Ah, of course! I remember now! There's a flywheel in each of the side antechambers. We need to start them spinning to open the main door."
"115740052-0-15671";"What an impressive door! Look at that craftsmanship. Remarkable! Grunda always had good taste, I have to say."
"115740052-0-15672";"Get up, scum. This is what you get for brewing skooma."
"115740052-0-15673";"It's a long walk to <<1>>. Don't try anything stupid."
"115740052-0-15674";"Come this way."
"115740052-0-15675";"This one understands."
"115740052-0-15676";"Soldier, keep watch. Head to <<1>> in the morning."
"115740052-0-15677";"Darien has rushed on ahead, as usual. I shall proceed with caution and see if I can keep him focused on the task at hand."
"115740052-0-15678";"What, no tea? No biscuits? We are not barbarians!"
"115740052-0-15679";"Well, that was disappointing. Hardly worked up a sweat!"
"115740052-0-15680";"I'm more than ready to get out of this awful place. Meet me outside, there's a good chap."
"115740052-0-15681";"I heard nothing…"
"115740052-0-15682";"Approach, newcomer. Converse with me."
"115740052-0-15683";"Tall Papa give me peace. Does this pile of wood have a bottom?"
"115740052-0-15684";"Be glad we have a barricade to clear. Had Tava's winds blown toward the bay, the whole dock would have burned."
"115740052-0-15685";"Taking our honored dead with it, no doubt."
"115740052-0-15686";"Shame they built it in such a hurry. This crate was filled with Cyrodilic wine."
"115740052-0-15687";"What a sad waste."
"115740052-0-15689";"Oh, I remember this! I know how to get back from here! I'll meet you back at my parents' tent."
"115740052-0-15690";"On that island, each stone, root, and flower was meticulously placed and nurtured by magic; a unique form of magic only ever to be wielded by two Altmer."
"115740052-0-15691";"I don't think this is the right way. I'm going back to my hiding spot."
"115740052-0-15692";"One of those two Altmer is now awake on this island."
"115740052-0-15693";"This doesn't seem like the right way to me. Maybe we should head back."
"115740052-0-15695";"Pain lies ahead. Turn back, master. This is not the place for us."
"115740052-0-15696";"Master, no! The flames burn us! It hurts, it hurts!"
"115740052-0-15697";"Make the bad men go away."
"115740052-0-15698";"Now picture an island."
"115740052-0-15699";"The island of Silatar."
"115740052-0-15700";"What-what have you done to me? You witch!"
"115740052-0-15701";"Quiet down, Ferhad! And Sit! There. Good dog. From now on, if you want a biscuit, we are going to have some new rules."
"115740052-0-15702";"Mmmmm. Mmmmm. I have a feeling I'm not going to like this."
"115740052-0-15703";"Oh I am! I am the perfect man for the job. Just tell me what you need, and I can make it happen!"
"115740052-0-15704";"I'll see you on the Two Moons Path."
"115740052-0-15705";"That's it. Again."
"115740052-0-15706";"What's going on here? No one move!"
"115740052-0-15707";"This one is so sorry, Juline. I do this because I must. One of us has to make it out of here and get back to our mission."
"115740052-0-15708";"Why, my dear friend? Why have you done this?"
"115740052-0-15714";"To ashes and embers, as it should be."
"115740052-0-15715";"Now for the rest of them. You lead. I shall strike from the shadows."
"115740052-0-15716";"Kill them."
"115740052-0-15717";"Hearken to me, Redguards! Now we see Ruptga's retribution for our Forebear king's blasphemous rule!"
"115740052-0-15718";"He shares water with Breton witches and Malooc's cursed sons! He has turned his shadow on Yokuda's true ways."
"115740052-0-15719";"Priest. I do not seek conflict so soon after tragedy, but you must go from here—immediately."
"115740052-0-15720";"Yes mistress."
"115740052-0-15721";"Do you give this command in Fahara'jad's name?"
"115740052-0-15722";"It is so. You are fomenting insurrection in time of war. Were you not a priest, I'd arrest you."
"115740052-0-15723";"You can silence me, sword-bearer, but Ruptga's will shall yet be done."
"115740052-0-15724";"We found the Mourning Stone on that pedestal. Wait, that's <<1>>! What's he doing up there?"
"115740052-0-15725";"Centurion Gavo! Good day, sir."
"115740052-0-15726";"At ease, soldier. A good day indeed!"
"115740052-0-15727";"Back from the docks, sir?"
"115740052-0-15728";"Yes. Inventory went well."
"115740052-0-15729";"I'll be in the tower. Make sure I'm not disturbed."
"115740052-0-15731";"Zara, my dear. Allow me to make our friend a little easier to kill!"
"115740052-0-15732";"Ishalga, my lovely! You honor me!"
"115740052-0-15733";"<<1>>, you did what mother could not."
"115740052-0-15734";"I did what I knew to be right. To restore our family's honor."
"115740052-0-15735";"I can't oppose you. I don't slay the living, only the dead."
"115740052-0-15736";"Run along, little worm. A brief reprieve only. I'll find you and your kin."
"115740052-0-15737";"You've proven worthy of our name. Do you understand?"
"115740052-0-15738";"Yes, Mother. I'll dance beneath the two moons, as you've taught me."
"115740052-0-15740";"Tell my father, the king, what they're planning. I'll summon the guard to the vault!"
"115740052-0-15741";"Oh, thank you. The rest who opposed Faenir have already escaped."
"115740052-0-15742";"Then we must complete your training."
"115740052-0-15743";"Deal with them, I am nearly finished."
"115740052-0-15744";"Yes, mistress."
"115740052-0-15745";"No interruptions. Yes, sir."
"115740052-0-15746";"Filth."
"115740052-0-15747";"Now, to Faenir, quickly. My blade does not enjoy being denied a meal."
"115740052-0-15748";"Lead on. I shall strike from the shadows."
"115740052-0-15749";"Tholbor, I can't let this whelp defeat you! I think it's time for you to get a second wind!"
"115740052-0-15750";"I was here first!"
"115740052-0-15751";"Let this one make things a bit more interesting."
"115740052-0-15752";"No you weren't! This one was here long before you."
"115740052-0-15753";"This one needs a quick refresher, then she will have your head!"
"115740052-0-15755";"Worthless animal. Burn in the fires of Oblivion."
"115740052-0-15756";"So the girl failed to eliminate you. No matter. I will remedy that."
"115740052-0-15757";"This changes … nothing."
"115740052-0-15758";"It's too late … he can't be stopped …."
"115740052-0-15759";"There he is! Looks like they've got him under guard."
"115740052-0-15761";"This one gives thanks."
"115740052-0-15762";"<<1>>? Ah, I understand."
"115740052-0-15763";"Spider weaves the web around its prey …."
"115740052-0-15764";"Scorpion's poison courses through its prey …"
"115740052-0-15765";"You don't have the will for this. But I do, cub."
"115740052-0-15770";"I saw one of the bandits press a stone over here to deactivate the traps."
"115740052-0-15771";"Over here! They appear to be in some sort of catatonic state."
"115740052-0-15772";"Ah!"
"115740052-0-15773";"Something's wrong here …."
"115740052-0-15774";"Into the chute! Come on!"
"115740052-0-15776";"Raz will meet you back at the Thalmor headquarters. The Trethane must learn of this immediately!"
"115740052-0-15777";"I smell death in here, Sameer. Gods, look at the walking bones! Do these Elves have no shame?"
"115740052-0-15778";"This is the right thing to do, Haqmir. I am sure of it."
"115740052-0-15779";"I accept my sentence. I will go."
"115740052-0-15780";"Nonsense. You will make a great king. I love you, Haqmir."
"115740052-0-15781";"I just want to make you understand!"
"115740052-0-15782";"Freedom! I'll add you to my wardrobe!"
"115740052-0-15783";"Thallik told me about you. Said I had nothing to fear. But you do. You do."
"115740052-0-15784";"How dare you interrupt my special time with Kinlady Estre!"
"115740052-0-15785";"You beat one of the champions. Impressive! Now the game is finally getting interesting!"
"115740052-0-15786";"Do try to hurry, Coristir. This rabble isn't worth our time."
"115740052-0-15787";"Well … that's not good."
"115740052-0-15788";"Thanks again and be careful. Watch out for the traps!"
"115740052-0-15789";"The guilty are drawn to us like torchbugs to honey. Come and be judged, mortals."
"115740052-0-15790";"Beautiful, aren't they?"
"115740052-0-15791";"Mara bless you! I thought for sure I was going to be burned alive!"
"115740052-0-15792";"What … what was I doing? I … I need to find the others."
"115740052-0-15793";"I've got to get out of here. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-15797";"I heard something click. It sounded like you got it open."
"115740052-0-15798";"Come forward, Erunor, caretaker-to-be."
"115740052-0-15799";"I, Erunor, in accordance with the Oath of Protection, stand ready."
"115740052-0-15800";"On behalf of the Wilderking, will you care for the Fading Tree?"
"115740052-0-15801";"I am honored to serve the Wilderking and our people."
"115740052-0-15802";"The Fading Tree is yours to protect. May the years pass quickly."
"115740052-0-15803";"Erunor! Seeing you gladdens my heart!"
"115740052-0-15804";"Had I known sooner about you … about us …."
"115740052-0-15805";"I thought we would have more time. And now, we shall."
"115740052-0-15806";"Prepare for our journey, beloved. I will join you soon."
"115740052-0-15807";"I leave joyfully, knowing you'll be with us."
"115740052-0-15808";"Arise, my beauty! Taste the air once again!"
"115740052-0-15809";"Yes, your father commands you. Kill!"
"115740052-0-15810";"Back foul temptress! I'll hear no more of your lies!"
"115740052-0-15811";"I am sorry my brother. The risk is too great. I cannot let you live."
"115740052-0-15812";"The Harvest Heart is destroyed!"
"115740052-0-15813";"My children are free!"
"115740052-0-15814";"Now, now, Tharn. No telling my secrets."
"115740052-0-15815";"Go to your room, Abnur. I will deal with you shortly."
"115740052-0-15816";"And you. The thorn in my side. The pebble in my shoe. How strong are you? Shall we test your limits?"
"115740052-0-15817";"How infuriating! The process drains the energy from most victims, yet you keep fighting!"
"115740052-0-15818";"Your strength surprises me. But how much more can you take, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-15819";"How dare you betray me, Tharn? Your suffering will be legendary!"
"115740052-0-15820";"Mannimarco! You dare attack the chancellor of the Elder Council?"
"115740052-0-15821";"His power wanes, Vestige! Strike him down, while his attentions are on me!"
"115740052-0-15822";"Ah, dear Lyris. Your old position at the Foundry is still available. We'll even give you your own set of unbreakable chains."
"115740052-0-15823";"Bakkhara … I'm not beyond redemption. Don't do this."
"115740052-0-15824";"I'm sorry Kargand, there is no other way."
"115740052-0-15825";"No!"
"115740052-0-15826";"How … how did I get here? I … I need to get away!"
"115740052-0-15827";"Oh, my poor Kargand. I'm so sorry it ended this way."
"115740052-0-15828";"We have gathered here to usher the Champions onto their next path. The trial path."
"115740052-0-15832";"Impressive. Most impressive. No one in the history of my games has ever defeated two champions. But now, you must face one more challenge."
"115740052-0-15833";"Defeat my guardians and reach the portal to claim your reward!"
"115740052-0-15834";"Help! I'm trapped! Please, help me!"
"115740052-0-15835";"You won't face the Observer alone. We're in this together."
"115740052-0-15836";"A barrier spell on the door? How pedestrian! Give me a moment and I'll open the way."
"115740052-0-15837";"By the Master's grace, I summon these fonts. May they power me with his wrath to crush my enemies."
"115740052-0-15838";"I can feel his power coursing through me! Minions of Molag Bal! Hear my words and defeat the enemies of the Mace!"
"115740052-0-15839";"Time to take care of you myself!"
"115740052-0-15840";"The Shackle sends metaphysical chains of energy across the planar chaos to latch onto our world."
"115740052-0-15841";"While the Dark Anchors have been able to pull portions of Nirn into Coldharbour, the Great Shackle has the power to steal our entire world."
"115740052-0-15842";"I must be weaker than I thought. That took a lot out of me. Once we get inside, you take the lead."
"115740052-0-15843";"I appreciate the help, and I won't forget this. I'll return the favor one day. You can count on that."
"115740052-0-15844";"You have my thanks, friend!"
"115740052-0-15845";"Rest for now my brother. The Mages Guild will help you. We will purge this corruption from your soul."
"115740052-0-15846";"Defend me while I cast this extremely powerful and fantastically impressive spell."
"115740052-0-15847";"Let's move out! The Great Shackle isn't going to destroy itself, you know."
"115740052-0-15848";"I did it. The Great Shackle has been shattered! The threat of the Planemeld is no more!"
"115740052-0-15849";"Enough! We can discuss this back in the Hollow City. I'll open a portal before this entire place collapses on top of us!"
"115740052-0-15850";"You dare interfere in my master's plans?"
"115740052-0-15851";"You saved me! I'm sorry, but I need to run. I have to find the others!"
"115740052-0-15852";"Such an interesting mortal."
"115740052-0-15853";"Your assistance might be just what I require."
"115740052-0-15854";"Foolish mortal. He escaped to my sanctum, but he cannot escape his fate."
"115740052-0-15855";"This creature is no different than those who burned your farm."
"115740052-0-15856";"Aranias, my child. Raise the ground up to trap this animal."
"115740052-0-15857";"Aranias. Do you remember how helpless you were when your farm burned?"
"115740052-0-15858";"The trick is small stitches, you see …"
"115740052-0-15859";"We shall see, Treeminder. We shall see."
"115740052-0-15862";"Talk to Hautt and Hridi. Perhaps they remember where they hid the lute and daggers."
"115740052-0-15864";"If you would follow me."
"115740052-0-15865";"As you can see, our artisans have built some small amount of civilization amidst this barbaric wilderness."
"115740052-0-15866";"Marbruk will soon be a jewel of the Dominion in this backward territory."
"115740052-0-15867";"As one would expect, we have encountered scattered protests. Nonsense about ""protecting the trees."""
"115740052-0-15868";"The local Bosmer are disorganized and flighty. Such outbursts usually fizzle out of their own accord."
"115740052-0-15869";"Ah, the Mages Guild. If you would follow me inside."
"115740052-0-15870";"The Bandit's reign of terror ends today!"
"115740052-0-15871";"Shazah. My daughter. It's good to see you again."
"115740052-0-15873";"Father?"
"115740052-0-15876";"You've become so adept with magic, my daughter. Your wisdom has far exceeded my own."
"115740052-0-15878";"No! Not yet! I can't …"
"115740052-0-15879";"Father, you are my guide. Why are you here? What am I to learn from this cleansing?"
"115740052-0-15880";"My Shazah, always so eager to learn. Cub, you and your sister have a connection that transcends knowledge. Now, you must face my past. Pray at the lunar shrines."
"115740052-0-15881";"Thank you for your wisdom, Father. Goodbye."
"115740052-0-15882";"You. Come with me."
"115740052-0-15886";"Behold, the Mages Guild. The paint is still fresh. A marvelous addition to the city."
"115740052-0-15887";"Work remains, of course, but one does what one must on the fringes of the Dominion."
"115740052-0-15888";"The vault is below. Follow me."
"115740052-0-15889";"Puny, wingless, mortal fools! I'll feast on your flesh after my little pet rips it from your bones!"
"115740052-0-15890";"You killed my darling creature! I'll tear out your hearts and serve them to my father on a silver platter!"
"115740052-0-15891";"Don't … don't let it take me! No!"
"115740052-0-15892";"It was all … worth it."
"115740052-0-15893";"Pardon me. I would speak with you."
"115740052-0-15895";"This is your last chance to turn tail and run before I destroy you."
"115740052-0-15898";"We have to get to the bottom of this."
"115740052-0-15899";"The fact that Jofnir's killer is still out there is unacceptable."
"115740052-0-15900";"And where is Sees-All-Colors through all of this?"
"115740052-0-15901";"Whoever did this will pay with their life."
"115740052-0-15902";"Don't worry, Svalkmar. Justice will be served."
"115740052-0-15904";"Still no word on Sees-All-Colors."
"115740052-0-15905";"She played such an active part in the original investigation."
"115740052-0-15906";"When I get my hands on that scaley —"
"115740052-0-15907";"We know Svalkmar. We all want justice."
"115740052-0-15908";"And we'll have it. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-15909";"I'll start the ritual. Get ready to defend me."
"115740052-0-15911";"Good job! You held them back long enough for me to complete this portion of the ritual."
"115740052-0-15912";"Defend me while I perform this portion of the ritual."
"115740052-0-15913";"Thank you for assisting me. This portion of the ritual is complete."
"115740052-0-15916";"That'll show them. No one attacks my island."
"115740052-0-15920";"I understand your concerns but think of the potential rewards. These woods have long been rumored to house a powerful forest spirit."
"115740052-0-15922";"There is something off about these Bosmer. Something wild. Feral. Are you sure they just won't attack us?"
"115740052-0-15923";"I agree with the Apprentice. How are we to get past these Bosmer if they try to stop us?"
"115740052-0-15924";"One more adjustment … there! Now I can draw even more energy from the mage!"
"115740052-0-15925";"We have visitors it seems. Perhaps they can be of assistance."
"115740052-0-15927";"Regardless of what he's told you, Magistrate, Istah and his bailiffs have made no progress in their investigation."
"115740052-0-15928";"Our work is finished. Let us return to Longhaven."
"115740052-0-15929";"Captain Ethrel, look at me, we're going to make it through this."
"115740052-0-15930";"Captain … Captain! Damn it all."
"115740052-0-15931";"Honestly, I'm more worried about the Withered Hand than these disappearances, Councilman. We just have to give Istah more time."
"115740052-0-15933";"I don't know. Bailiff Fakimal—the one who lives at the northwest edge of town—I heard he was ignoring evidence in the case."
"115740052-0-15934";"We can't believe everything we hear. You have my word though, if necessary, I will deal with Istah."
"115740052-0-15935";"The person behind the disappearances is definitely a Crown. No doubt about it."
"115740052-0-15936";"Because there were shreds of a Crown dishdasha left at one of the crime scenes."
"115740052-0-15937";"Now that's low, even for you. How could you possibly know that?"
"115740052-0-15938";"Are the bailiffs covering that up? This is the first I've heard of it."
"115740052-0-15939";"Strange winged beasts—pets of the vampires … or were they once Bosmer themselves?"
"115740052-0-15940";"The web-weavers make fitting companions for the vampires and their enthralling mist."
"115740052-0-15941";"Our brother Istah has not visited the fellowship house much of late."
"115740052-0-15942";"Truly? What possible reason would the guards have for keeping out a bailiff?"
"115740052-0-15943";"No, but one of the bailiffs was here. Believe it or not, the guards almost didn't let him in."
"115740052-0-15944";"His Crown dishdasha was all shredded up. I suppose it happened when he arrested someone. I just gave him a new one."
"115740052-0-15945";"Your mug is empty. How can you resist the fragrant aroma of the Everfull's Special Blend?"
"115740052-0-15946";"You draw your sword when you're frightened, Khali. Just like when you were a little girl."
"115740052-0-15947";"This vault holds many rare plants that no longer exist in the Summerset Isles. Do take a closer look. I am no scholar of botany, but I know something about our specimens."
"115740052-0-15948";"Mother? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-15949";"Even as a cub, you were filled with such anger. After I died, that anger grew. Now, you laugh and curse in turn."
"115740052-0-15950";"Mother, Namu … we lost you so long ago. And you were gone so much. Why are you here?"
"115740052-0-15951";"Hey! Are you down there? I need to speak to you!"
"115740052-0-15952";"I know, Khali. But you and Shazah had each other. A bond that transcends your rage. Now, face your past. Face my rage. Pray at the lunar shrines."
"115740052-0-15953";"Wait! Don't go!"
"115740052-0-15954";"Justice Istah. You are hereby found guilty of obstructing an investigation, and conspiring against the people of Bergama."
"115740052-0-15955";"This room holds Ayleid relics uncovered across Valenwood. Interesting, aren't they?\n\nWe've removed any dormant traps, that we know of, so feel free to examine them more closely. I will answer any questions you have about them."
"115740052-0-15956";"The promised one has finally arrived. The Light of Meridia is yours to claim. With it, you can finally set me free."
"115740052-0-15957";"I do not know from where these charges originate, Magistrate, but I am innocent. You will see. The truth will come to light."
"115740052-0-15958";"You will remain here until a thorough investigation has been completed. I am sorry, Istah."
"115740052-0-15959";"Mane Akkhuz-ri, it is a pleasure to meet you. The Khajiit and their faith will be the Dominion's bulwark against the darkness."
"115740052-0-15960";"Thank you, my Queen. May the Bright Moons guide us in our new endeavor."
"115740052-0-15961";"Behold. The Staff of Magnus."
"115740052-0-15962";"Glad you made it. Just hold the keys up to the pillars and we'll be on our way."
"115740052-0-15963";"What? What happened? Where is it?"
"115740052-0-15964";"This must be the main ""living"" quarters. Faenir must be near. At last, my prey is within reach."
"115740052-0-15965";"Come on you dogs! We need to get this load of bodies out of here. Alasan is waiting."
"115740052-0-15966";"So that explains what we saw as we slew them. They bound themselves to the skull. Dark magic often comes with a heavy price."
"115740052-0-15967";"Chosen of Marbruk, your queen has arrived! Present yourselves!"
"115740052-0-15968";"Bear witness to the glory of Queen Ayrenn, hope of the Dominon!"
"115740052-0-15969";"Our ticket's up. Ladies first!"
"115740052-0-15970";"This one is no lady."
"115740052-0-15971";"No! We must treat with them!"
"115740052-0-15972";"That should do it. If that doesn't get my clan's attention, nothing will. Now let's get the head of the champion and get out of here!"
"115740052-0-15973";"So this is the outsider that Faraniel has been dragging around the forest? Interesting."
"115740052-0-15974";"Let me handle the talking. I have a way with words."
"115740052-0-15975";"My woodland friends, I come with good tidings from the Mages Guild. We seek a relationship of mutual learning."
"115740052-0-15976";"My friends, there is no need for weapons. We come in peace!"
"115740052-0-15977";"The maiden has decreed that you have no place here! You'll feed the earth tonight."
"115740052-0-15978";"You knocked down an old man!"
"115740052-0-15979";"I've had just about enough of this."
"115740052-0-15981";"I think everyone needs a drink. How about some more mead!"
"115740052-0-15982";"Jone and Jode, you have shown the way to Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. This one is your humble servant."
"115740052-0-15983";"By your light this one will lead his people. By your light will this one imbue balance to the Khajiit."
"115740052-0-15984";"Jone and Jode have spoken. Shazah, Khali … you were both born beneath the same moon. Never before has this happened. Never before have the Bright Moons gifted us this way. Forevermore you will be known as the ""Lunar Champions."""
"115740052-0-15985";"We … we understand. The Mane is strong, and we are … we are new."
"115740052-0-15986";"Yes, we understand. We're an embarrassment! We didn't ask for this. We were born this way, moons-be-damned!"
"115740052-0-15987";"You're <<1>>'s ally, yes? Please, disable these traps so she can make it to us safely."
"115740052-0-15993";"We have been trying to transplant this unusual variety of Redwort plant into Summerset for some time."
"115740052-0-15994";"We found these in a Valenwood cave, of all places."
"115740052-0-15995";"Crimson Nirnroot. We thought it was a Nord tall-tale."
"115740052-0-15996";"Alchemists pay a dear price for this plant. It will be the jewel of the royal gardens."
"115740052-0-15998";"Scholars believe this relic was broken into pieces when it fell from the heavens. They believe there may be others in Hectahame, the legendary center of Valenwood."
"115740052-0-15999";"This helm is actually from our own collection, but one of our Bosmer … allies … stole it, and then returned it in exchange for a song."
"115740052-0-16000";"The tree-gifts. We're not actually sure what it does."
"115740052-0-16001";"Sir Cadwell came through again! That crazy knight is starting to grow on me. Should I be worried?"
"115740052-0-16002";"This should do it!"
"115740052-0-16003";"Hello again! Need a way out?"
"115740052-0-16004";"It's not much further."
"115740052-0-16005";"You must be the ugliest princess ever rescued from a tower, Tharn."
"115740052-0-16006";"We don't want any more mead! Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-16008";"Shor's bones! We've been deceived!"
"115740052-0-16010";"Your souls are mine! You may as well drink up and accept your fate."
"115740052-0-16011";"I want to hear you beg or I'll cut off the supply of Special Blend!"
"115740052-0-16015";"Outsider! Step forth and hear the decision of the council of elders."
"115740052-0-16016";"These three cups contain moon-sugar elixir, a sacred potion. They will allow the light of the moons into your souls. Champions, step forth and drink the elixir."
"115740052-0-16017";"This third cup is for the Moon Hallowed, who will walk with the Champions on their path. Hallowed, step forward and drink the elixir."
"115740052-0-16018";"Hallowed, speak to <<1>> or <<2>> and begin to walk the path of trials. Bright Moons go with you."
"115740052-0-16019";"Hope to see you again somewhere less … horrible."
"115740052-0-16020";"I guess I have to be the hero this time, right?"
"115740052-0-16021";"Don't worry about me. Imagine the stories I can tell once I break out of this place."
"115740052-0-16022";"I … I'll make you proud."
"115740052-0-16023";"Do you think it's funny to torment Hazazi? My tail swishes angrily at you."
"115740052-0-16024";"This is a dark moon, but Azsu's claws are bared and he will do what he must."
"115740052-0-16025";"What in Oblivion is that?"
"115740052-0-16026";"You worthless rag! This tomb can't hold me forever!"
"115740052-0-16029";"More are coming! We have to leave him!"
"115740052-0-16030";"That hut. This place … are those supposed to be Knahaten flu victims?"
"115740052-0-16031";"Colovian bastards. Where are you?"
"115740052-0-16032";"I know there are more of you. I can smell you!"
"115740052-0-16033";"Come out and face me!"
"115740052-0-16034";"What's going on here?"
"115740052-0-16035";"Nelhilda, please come here."
"115740052-0-16036";"What is it, father?"
"115740052-0-16037";"I need to get this off my chest. I made the deal that doomed us. I made the bargain with the Daedric Prince."
"115740052-0-16038";"Father! Why would you do such a thing? I lost my love to this cursed place because you weren't selling enough mead?"
"115740052-0-16039";"How can I ever forgive you for this? I never want to see you again!"
"115740052-0-16040";"Come, mortal. Let's not waste time, shall we?"
"115740052-0-16041";"Nelhilda was the only thing that kept me sane in this dread place. What will I do now?"
"115740052-0-16042";"Why are your clothes all wet?"
"115740052-0-16043";"Mother! What do you think of this tree? How about this island you're standing on?"
"115740052-0-16044";"The ground is soaked. I will need new shoes now."
"115740052-0-16045";"I made it!"
"115740052-0-16046";"What? You made the ground soggy?"
"115740052-0-16047";"The island. I made this little island!"
"115740052-0-16048";"What? Ara, what do you mean you made it?"
"115740052-0-16049";"These trees, those rocks, none of this was here yesterday. The ground is wet because I used my magic to pull it up from under the water."
"115740052-0-16050";"Oh, Ara. What have you done?"
"115740052-0-16051";"Mother? What's wrong? Why are you walking away?"
"115740052-0-16053";"Oh good, another projection of Tharn! Maybe if we ignore him he'll go away."
"115740052-0-16055";"We have a prisoner. Perhaps he can shed some light on where we can find this forest spirit."
"115740052-0-16056";"This must be where I am to meet my guide."
"115740052-0-16057";"So they killed Ahainar-jo? His death will not be a hollow one. We've managed to capture a prisoner."
"115740052-0-16060";"Not very big, is it? Oh well. Now, cast the ritual from the book."
"115740052-0-16061";"What … what just happened? He's gone!"
"115740052-0-16062";"Look at the coward run. This isn't worth my time. Let me know when you finally find someone worth the effort to kill."
"115740052-0-16064";"Brace yourself … wait. Who are you?"
"115740052-0-16065";"You smell friendly. Brace yourselves! Here they come!"
"115740052-0-16066";"Very well, let's see what he has to tell us."
"115740052-0-16067";"Why? Why my love? Why is this happening?"
"115740052-0-16068";"Seems like no matter who's in charge mages aren't appreciated."
"115740052-0-16069";"I hope you like it here. You're about to become a permanent resident!"
"115740052-0-16070";"No, it's worse now. One of those drunken brutes almost broke my arm yesterday."
"115740052-0-16071";"The Hunt … it's turned them. This never would have happened if the Dominion had stayed intact! Damn the eagle banner!"
"115740052-0-16072";"I'm glad you two showed up. You can help us find … nng."
"115740052-0-16073";"This militia is falling apart. How much longer does <<1>> expect to keep it together?"
"115740052-0-16074";"<<1>> said to be patient, and he's never led us astray."
"115740052-0-16075";"Even if you strike me down, Naemon will destroy you."
"115740052-0-16076";"There you are. We've made progress."
"115740052-0-16077";"My father's medical team? Dark moons!"
"115740052-0-16078";"We're not safe yet, my love. I can hear … more coming!"
"115740052-0-16079";"Norvir loved this lute, but never played a note. Every day he came home from the market to stare lovingly at the lute. ""Some day,"" he thought, ""When I retire, I will have all the time to play."" That day came—but so did Graccus."
"115740052-0-16080";"Colovians, here? These bastards killed my mother. Let's take them out!"
"115740052-0-16081";"Erunor … I thought you loved me."
"115740052-0-16082";"Nng! The pain! I can't go on much longer like this."
"115740052-0-16083";"Thara lived her life by the hourglass. She scheduled everything. She had a place for everything. Her life was order—some jested she was switched with an Altmer child at birth. With order came happiness for her. Graccus ended both."
"115740052-0-16084";"Fardel was never far from this mug. After the death of his wife to plague, he found comfort only in drink. He was loved and supported, but never escaped the darkness. He lived a life of quiet melancholy. Graccus ended that quiet. Ended everything."
"115740052-0-16085";"You killed my mother, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-16087";"I don't know what it is, but I can feel a strong magical presence here."
"115740052-0-16088";"What's wrong, my heart? Are you wounded?"
"115740052-0-16089";"I don't know. I feel weak. I don't know what's happening."
"115740052-0-16090";"You're weak, just like your mother!"
"115740052-0-16091";"Your strikes lack strength!"
"115740052-0-16092";"You … you bastards!"
"115740052-0-16093";"Hold on a little longer, my love … damn it. Yet more coming. Help us!"
"115740052-0-16094";"Through there, the doorway!"
"115740052-0-16095";"You notice how one merchant almost soil himself?"
"115740052-0-16096";"I did! He almost passed out when we told him <<1>> sent us."
"115740052-0-16097";"Can you believe these militia members? They still think they have control."
"115740052-0-16098";"<<1>> did good job infiltrating and taking control. We make whole camp refuge for bandits soon."
"115740052-0-16099";"We can't hold this place. Got to get out of here. Follow, if you would live."
"115740052-0-16100";"Local merchants so weak, easy to extort."
"115740052-0-16101";"Just wait till we don't have to tip-toe around these milita goodies."
"115740052-0-16102";"This magic is incredibly potent. We may need to combine our efforts to open this door."
"115740052-0-16103";"I have a bad feeling about this. We can still turn back. We have our lives to think about."
"115740052-0-16104";"The fauna is fascinating in here. It's infused with magic."
"115740052-0-16105";"Nonsense, Draval. Think of all the terrifyingly beautiful things we've seen here. I could release an entire codex from today's findings alone."
"115740052-0-16106";"You need to help them—she's slaughtering us!"
"115740052-0-16107";"Quickly, return to the barrier!"
"115740052-0-16108";"The Cleansing is complete. <<1>> and <<2>> have left the path of the Lunar Champions behind."
"115740052-0-16109";"The portal is closed!  We make a most effective team, my friend."
"115740052-0-16110";"Watch and learn, my friend. Watch and learn. Let me show you how to close a Daedric portal."
"115740052-0-16111";"These creatures do not frighten me. Let us close this portal."
"115740052-0-16112";"Watch your step!"
"115740052-0-16113";"Don't trip!"
"115740052-0-16114";"So nice to see you again, my dear Selene.\n\nYour secrets belong to me, now. Even in death you will help me in so very many ways."
"115740052-0-16115";"My Queen! I've failed you."
"115740052-0-16116";"You made a deal with the Guild. Not with me.\n\nYour soul will make me one of the most powerful mages in the Guild."
"115740052-0-16117";"Listen, everyone! We're going to the Hollow City! Join us! We're Nords and we can handle whatever Coldharbour throws our way!"
"115740052-0-16118";"You won't be sorry if we ever get into an actual battle."
"115740052-0-16119";"I know—he says I have to spar with <<1>>."
"115740052-0-16120";"True, but now he's making us do the same weapon drills as the other recruits."
"115740052-0-16121";"Well, with <<1>> back in charge we're finally getting some respect."
"115740052-0-16122";"You ready to admit defeat yet?"
"115740052-0-16123";"Not on your scrawny life."
"115740052-0-16124";"A challenge? Good. I saw which tent you came out of, meddler. I'll make your death a painful one."
"115740052-0-16126";"The Den of Lorkhaj … it's even more beautiful and horrible than I could have imagined. Come, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-16127";"The Dremora are keeping the seal intact! You'll have to kill them too!"
"115740052-0-16128";"The Dremora replaced the destroyed crystals!"
"115740052-0-16129";"These crystals are powering a seal protecting the sigil stone. We're trying to break them, but it'll take time."
"115740052-0-16130";"What is that?"
"115740052-0-16131";"Focus! Our friend hunts for us."
"115740052-0-16132";"We're trying to destroy the crystals protecting the sigil stone! Keep that abomination off of us!"
"115740052-0-16133";"We did it! You were amazing! Now let's get that sigil stone before the Daedra advance."
"115740052-0-16134";"Where did he go? What just happened here?"
"115740052-0-16135";"Leave me here, my love. Find safety. I can fend for myself."
"115740052-0-16136";"Don't say that. You'll be well. There's still hope, love. There's still hope."
"115740052-0-16137";"What's wrong? What's happening?"
"115740052-0-16138";"Run. Get out of here!"
"115740052-0-16139";"No, love. I won't. I can't leave you!"
"115740052-0-16140";"Get out of here before I hurt you!"
"115740052-0-16141";"Help me! You're the only one I can trust. Save your Queen!"
"115740052-0-16142";"I've finally put you down, cat. Just try to meddle now!"
"115740052-0-16143";"Please, <<1>>. You must eat. You're wasting away to nothing!"
"115740052-0-16144";"No! <<1>> is mine! You won't take him from me!"
"115740052-0-16145";"We trusted you! How could you betray your own people?"
"115740052-0-16146";"I didn't betray the people. I joined them in ending the rule of a tyrant!"
"115740052-0-16147";"Oh, thank you! Let's meet by the wayshrine, just east of this tower. I'll be fine. As long as the Daedra think I still belong to Drasilla, they won't harm me."
"115740052-0-16148";"Follow me! Before more of them come. We have to get out of here."
"115740052-0-16149";"Andur demonstrates amazing potential."
"115740052-0-16150";"Why are we bothering with this girl and her clods of dirt? Andur could melt them with hardly a thought."
"115740052-0-16151";"What do they call her? The Rock Witch? Hilarious. Provincial."
"115740052-0-16152";"Her parents invited me to witness her powers firsthand."
"115740052-0-16153";"She lifted the ground up under my very feet."
"115740052-0-16154";"Her demonstration today will not be one of skill, but of character."
"115740052-0-16155";"Andur has one of the little beggars in the field, away from the house."
"115740052-0-16156";"Aranias will demonstrate her talents on the other."
"115740052-0-16157";"Her demonstration will determine how we employ her talents."
"115740052-0-16158";"Good. Good. Now, tear this animal apart."
"115740052-0-16159";"Please."
"115740052-0-16160";"Please let us go."
"115740052-0-16161";"No! I won't do it!"
"115740052-0-16162";"Your nagging is becoming more annoying than my persistent rash. We finally have a secure base—to go back outside without a plan is even too foolhardy for me."
"115740052-0-16163";"You want us to hide behind these walls? To leave our comrades to die while you sip wine and lounge about? You have no honor, knight!"
"115740052-0-16164";"Don't lecture me about honor, Elf! You have no idea what I've seen or what I've gone through!"
"115740052-0-16165";"A moment, gentlemen. Postpone your exchange of harsh words long enough to acknowledge our visitor."
"115740052-0-16166";"My daughters and I will be delighted to feast on your blood."
"115740052-0-16167";"Attend me, soldiers! We have a war to win and time grows short."
"115740052-0-16168";"What in Auriel's name is this? Who are you?"
"115740052-0-16169";"So that's the last Ayleid, huh? I thought he'd be more … dusty. Isn't that what happens when Elves get really, really old?"
"115740052-0-16170";"Shut it, you fop."
"115740052-0-16171";"Who's in charge of this group? Step forward and address me."
"115740052-0-16172";"Captain Alphaury was killed. We have no commanding officer at present."
"115740052-0-16173";"Then allow me to rectify that. I shall lead you. We shall recover your comrades and complete your mission. If that does not work for you, your services are no longer needed."
"115740052-0-16174";"I don't know who you are, but you aren't Fighters Guild. You have no authority over us!"
"115740052-0-16175";"Do you challenge me, then? Do you want me to kill you to prove my combat prowess to your companions?"
"115740052-0-16176";"I wouldn't necessarily mind seeing that. He is kind of annoying."
"115740052-0-16177";"Darien! Don't make this any more difficult than it already is!"
"115740052-0-16178";"How can you expect us to lay down our lives for someone we never met? Trust is earned on the battlefield!"
"115740052-0-16179";"If you want to survive, if you want to win this, you must trust me. Allow me to explain why you need my leadership."
"115740052-0-16180";"We shall work this out. I understand your reservations. But with my leadership, the Fighters Guild will help us win this war."
"115740052-0-16181";"Shazah … I've missed you. You left me alone in the dark."
"115740052-0-16182";"Ahh, you remember her?"
"115740052-0-16183";"Shazah? Is that you? You're alive? You're safe?"
"115740052-0-16184";"Of course I'm alive. Safe and sound …."
"115740052-0-16185";"Your sister is safe. Her soul has been purified by darkness. Come, join her. Come join your sister."
"115740052-0-16186";"Oh, you want her free? Here is your sister, free. Your sister, my new Dark Mane!"
"115740052-0-16187";"Let her go! Show yourself, you bastard! I'll take your face off with my claws."
"115740052-0-16188";"It seems I have the wrong sister … weakling child!"
"115740052-0-16189";"Ah, my old friend! I thought we'd lost you."
"115740052-0-16190";"Fine! I'll take care of you myself."
"115740052-0-16191";"What? It … it can't be!"
"115740052-0-16192";"So good to see you all again, my friends! I'm glad we all made it here safely."
"115740052-0-16193";"Vanny! You're alive! That's wonderful!"
"115740052-0-16194";"Ah, dear Nalia! My heart fills with delight at the sight of you! Yes, I am safe."
"115740052-0-16195";"Where have you been, old friend? Trying to win the war all by yourself again?"
"115740052-0-16196";"Well, yes, but I ran into a bit of trouble. Our friend here showed up and lent me a hand."
"115740052-0-16197";"Well, then, you have our thanks. I'm not sure we could have gone on without … without Vanus …."
"115740052-0-16198";"Cheer up, dear Nalia. I'm here now. But our mission isn't finished. We have to destroy the planar vortex and end the Planemeld."
"115740052-0-16199";"Do you have a plan, old friend?"
"115740052-0-16200";"I know what we need to do, I'm just not sure how we go about doing it. We need to discuss this with the Fighters Guild. We need a council of war."
"115740052-0-16201";"Dark Mane! Attend me! May the shadows of your dead god imbue you with strength!"
"115740052-0-16202";"Praise Tall Papa that the ogrim couldn't find the keys to the cages.  I've almost got these knots untied. Help me finish so I can get out of here."
"115740052-0-16205";"Skordo sent you, didn't he? Thank Tall Papa!"
"115740052-0-16206";"I won't kill your precious Fariel. When we take Woodhearth, I'll keep her for myself."
"115740052-0-16207";"What? Who are…"
"115740052-0-16208";"Speak of her now, snakecharmer."
"115740052-0-16209";"Did you hear? Some puffed up Altmer took the great stone out from Mourning Springs and an army of skeletons rose from the depths!"
"115740052-0-16210";"Yes! But some walker was there to crush them back down with lightning, walls of water … real five-clawed stuff!"
"115740052-0-16211";"Yes! And a good thing, too! This one does not like to think about what would have happened otherwise."
"115740052-0-16212";"Still nothing."
"115740052-0-16213";"What do they think they are playing at? We paid them, yes?"
"115740052-0-16214";"Who knows? Maybe they got caught? It wouldn't be the first time."
"115740052-0-16216";"Climbs, if they don't make the drop soon, let's cut our losses and make for the mainland."
"115740052-0-16217";"This one does not like it, but perhaps you are right. Still, keep checking, will you?"
"115740052-0-16219";"<<1>>, my friend! You have fish to share with <<2>> today?"
"115740052-0-16220";"No, they are hiding! Sometimes they sneak a nibble, but that is all. Perhaps something is wrong with the water?"
"115740052-0-16221";"Ah, perhaps so. The storm, it has broken a great many things. Why not the water, as well?"
"115740052-0-16222";"Three and six. A good haul."
"115740052-0-16223";"Ah, our friends! They must have recovered from the storm, yes?"
"115740052-0-16224";"It had to happen sooner or later. ""The crossed tree never falls,"" or so they say."
"115740052-0-16225";"Still, all these soldiers mucking about … it makes me nervous."
"115740052-0-16226";"You worry for nothing, little one. Their roots have grown for many years. It will take more than a few elves to tear them up."
"115740052-0-16227";"You have meddled with my affairs long enough. It is time to end this."
"115740052-0-16228";"Yes. The time has come to end this. This evil."
"115740052-0-16229";"What are you doing here? Your ward is broken, Ansei! You are no threat to me!"
"115740052-0-16230";"I cannot believe <<1>> let those sea snakes into port again!"
"115740052-0-16231";"This is the fourth horse in a month. Wonder why I keep losing them…."
"115740052-0-16232";"And without a charter or anything! You would think they owned the place."
"115740052-0-16233";"At least the Dominion has arrived. Maybe they can talk some sense into the Headwoman."
"115740052-0-16234";"Or replace her. <<1>> can only benefit from Dominion rule. If that Betmer buffoon is allowed to continue in her post, I —"
"115740052-0-16235";"Hush, <<1>>! You must not speak of our hosts, so. After all, someone may be listening!"
"115740052-0-16236";"Did you hear? That Maormer ambassador was plotting against us all along!"
"115740052-0-16237";"It is as I said, <<1>>. No good can come of them!"
"115740052-0-16238";"Quite right, my dear. It is a good thing <<1>> was here to put them in their place."
"115740052-0-16239";"It was not all his doing. From what I understand, we have another to thank for that bit of business!"
"115740052-0-16240";"Is that so? Well. If the Prince was not directly responsible, he was at least involved in the matter. In any case, I am glad it's over. I couldn't bear another moment with those salty ruffians about."
"115740052-0-16241";"Now! Take the ward and use it to trap Alasan!"
"115740052-0-16242";"This one knows there is an entrance to the tower somewhere nearby! Kamu … must … get … in!"
"115740052-0-16243";"Attention, please! I have called you all here because the moment of destiny fast approaches."
"115740052-0-16244";"The Great Shackle has been destroyed, but not before a planar vortex was established. We must destroy this vortex before it sucks the very essences of Nirn into Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-16245";"The Fighters Guild shall deal with the Chasm's defenders, but blades have little power against magic."
"115740052-0-16246";"And that's where my mages come in."
"115740052-0-16247";"Our scouts report that some kind of magical fixtures block access to the path across the Chasm. Mages there already work on a way to overcome these fixtures, and we are prepared to lend our strength when the main force arrives."
"115740052-0-16248";"A sound plan. Plays to our unique strengths. But this one wonders, what if the mages can't overcome Molag Bal's magic?"
"115740052-0-16249";"What a ridiculous question! Of course my mages can overcome this magic!"
"115740052-0-16250";"Ah, magic! The solution to all life's problems. I love magic! It's so … magical."
"115740052-0-16251";"I have absolute confidence in Vanus and his mages."
"115740052-0-16252";"Thank you, your lordship. But to be honest with you, I'm not feeling as confident as Vanus about this."
"115740052-0-16253";"We shall fight with all our strength. There is no other option. Lives will be lost, but hopefully a world will be saved."
"115740052-0-16254";"Know that the Chasm is only the first stage of this battle. The planar vortex abides within the very heart of Molag Bal's lair."
"115740052-0-16255";"Oh, this just gets better and better!"
"115740052-0-16256";"Darien! Mind your tongue!"
"115740052-0-16257";"Darien only seeks to lighten a tense situation. Still, we have to try. To do nothing is to doom Tamriel to certain destruction."
"115740052-0-16258";"Well, when you put it that way, there are a lot of lovely ladies that need to be saved …."
"115740052-0-16259";"Yes, well, be that as it may, we launch our assault on the Chasm immediately. The King needs to talk to the champion and I must discuss some final details with the mages. The rest of you have your own preparations to see to, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-16260";"Citizens of Arenthia, bright moons hang above us."
"115740052-0-16261";"We have thrown back the Colovian invaders. We have reclaimed our homes."
"115740052-0-16262";"Keep your heads held high, for your part in the fight will not be forgotten."
"115740052-0-16263";"We rejoin the March, beneath the Eagle's banner! Aldmeri Dominion!"
"115740052-0-16264";"Citizens of Arenthia, your eyes did not deceive you."
"115740052-0-16265";"Your Mane was corrupted, your streets haunted by Daedric cultists."
"115740052-0-16266";"This one stands before you, humbled. Your Mane no longer."
"115740052-0-16267";"The next Mane, whoever they are, must have your trust and loyalty."
"115740052-0-16268";"I grow weary of this situation. It's time to put an end to Ifriz's interference."
"115740052-0-16269";"Bright moons light your path as we leave Arenthia's darkest hour."
"115740052-0-16270";"You need to kill Ifriz. I need him dead. It seems we have a common goal to discuss."
"115740052-0-16271";"Shazah? Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-16272";"No! I've waited for so long! You won't stop me!"
"115740052-0-16273";"Your sorrow is misplaced. Your sister is at peace. Together, you and she have walked the Two Moons Path to its end."
"115740052-0-16274";"No! Damnit … I had to let you go once already. I'm not ready to lose you again."
"115740052-0-16275";"Her soul is at peace now. She has traveled beyond the Path to Aetherius. The light of the Bright Moons surrounding and guiding her."
"115740052-0-16276";"How can I trust anything I've seen? The Path has shown me terrors, lies … failure."
"115740052-0-16277";"Shazah … don't cry. Tharn can't hurt me now. I'm at peace. Soon I'll be with Mother and Father."
"115740052-0-16278";"Please … don't leave me."
"115740052-0-16279";"Goodbye, my sister. You will be the Mane. You will lead the Khajiit with wisdom and strength. Know always that I love you."
"115740052-0-16280";"Hallowed, Champion, your journey is complete. Return now to Dune, and begin to walk the next path in your lives."
"115740052-0-16281";"You there. You're searching for me, aren't you? Let us speak quickly. I don't have much time."
"115740052-0-16282";"You broke the Ansei Ward? You think that will stop me? I am not finished!"
"115740052-0-16283";"Hey, Aruz! I owe you one! For Borgath!"
"115740052-0-16284";"You are undone by your own heroics, dog. I may not be a lich, but I have an army of undead!"
"115740052-0-16285";"Grab the key. It's in that chest over there. I'll go back and check on the others. Meet me by the passage door."
"115740052-0-16286";"You will die. You will die and then you will join my army."
"115740052-0-16287";"There is no one but the dead here, hero. We made sure of that."
"115740052-0-16288";"Well done, little mortal. You killed Ifriz and I didn't have to lift a finger. Delightful!"
"115740052-0-16289";"You and I will meet again, I think. I look forward to seeing what trouble you get into next."
"115740052-0-16291";"Wait! That's my sister! After her, Hallowed!"
"115740052-0-16292";"Your journey as Champions is complete. The final cleansing begins. Relax your bodies, calm your minds."
"115740052-0-16293";"On your feet friend. You're going to tell us all about this forest."
"115740052-0-16294";"I've already told you. The forest is all we live for. You are no threat to me."
"115740052-0-16295";"We shall see."
"115740052-0-16296";"Who's that? Is that a Dremora?"
"115740052-0-16297";"Let the light of Jone and Jode wash away your doubts, your regrets!"
"115740052-0-16298";"The cleansing is complete. Moon Hallowed, step forward and speak to me."
"115740052-0-16299";"They're dead in the water! Mages! Prepare your spells!"
"115740052-0-16300";"Cast at will!"
"115740052-0-16301";"We have incoming! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-16302";"Stand your ground! Wreck these Maormer!"
"115740052-0-16303";"A sea serpent? Damn those Maormer!"
"115740052-0-16304";"Brace for impact!"
"115740052-0-16305";"Load the fire launchers! Burn that beast down before it sinks us!"
"115740052-0-16306";"It did not like that! More incoming! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-16307";"Man the fire launchers! Destroy that damnable snake!"
"115740052-0-16308";"Mage gates? They are teleporting. Prepare to repel boarders!"
"115740052-0-16309";"Mages, capture those portals! We'll use them to launch an attack!"
"115740052-0-16310";"I want that serpent dead! Man the fire launchers! Drop it in the sea!"
"115740052-0-16311";"Well done! Quickly, before they recover!"
"115740052-0-16312";"Enter the portals! Board their ship!"
"115740052-0-16313";"I can do this. Just like forgetting my notes. Here we go."
"115740052-0-16314";"Oh, wow. Master Telenger's spell is easier than I thought. I think I …."
"115740052-0-16315";"Something's wrong. What's going wrong? I did it right!"
"115740052-0-16316";"It's … I need … help!"
"115740052-0-16317";"Ahhh …."
"115740052-0-16318";"What do you have to say now?"
"115740052-0-16319";"Nothing to you, whorespawn. Your kind will never rule the forest, not as long as Selene is its guardian."
"115740052-0-16320";"What's going on here? You've summoned Daedra into our forest!"
"115740052-0-16321";"We're working on it … please, I'm trying to …."
"115740052-0-16322";"You're a monster! Our contract is broken. The Green has spoken."
"115740052-0-16323";"No! Wait!"
"115740052-0-16324";"We'll see about that little one."
"115740052-0-16325";"Radithax, are you hurt?"
"115740052-0-16326";"I'll be fine. I have the marsh in my veins."
"115740052-0-16327";"Watch out! It's going to ram us!"
"115740052-0-16328";"Your father, he will not miss you?"
"115740052-0-16329";"No, all that longwhisker cares about is sheep! ""Where are they grazing, <<1>>? What did you feed them? Where did the little one wander off to?"""
"115740052-0-16330";"It is a wonder his fur has not fluffed and coiled!"
"115740052-0-16331";"But still, he provides for you, no? And your mother, before she …."
"115740052-0-16332";"Yes. Yes, he is owed for that. And if not for him, we would not have met. We would not be so happy as we have come to be!"
"115740052-0-16333";"He will live with us, then? Once we are wed?"
"115740052-0-16334";"If … if your parents will have it, this one will not stand in the way."
"115740052-0-16335";"Onward! Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-16336";"Oh, <<1>>! How is it we came to find each other? You, a herdsman! Me, the daughter of a great merchant!"
"115740052-0-16337";"Two moons smiled on us and danced us across ja-Kha'jay! And now, once we are wed—"
"115740052-0-16338";"Once mother approves, you mean?"
"115740052-0-16339";"Of course, love! How could <<1>> forget? But once we are together, we bring our dance to the world, yes? On one of your father's finest ships!"
"115740052-0-16340";"It will be wonderful, my dear! But come, you must speak with mother! Surely, we cannot marry without her consent?"
"115740052-0-16341";"Of … of course, my love. Next time we see her, she will know all we plan and we will ask her for her blessing. Aheh. How could she say no?"
"115740052-0-16342";"Our ship has sunk. We must find someone to hire us until the next comes in."
"115740052-0-16343";"Perhaps we should ask the local government? They will need help rebuilding after that gale, no?"
"115740052-0-16344";"I'm not too keen on that. A little town like this won't be able to pay up front. We're leaving on the next boat we can get, right?"
"115740052-0-16345";"You have a better idea? Spit it out."
"115740052-0-16346";"Hey, ideas aren't my strong suit! I'm just saying. Look at this place. Do they look like they can afford us?"
"115740052-0-16347";"You have a point. <<1>>, what else?"
"115740052-0-16348";"Let's ask around. I'm sure something will come up."
"115740052-0-16349";"<<1>>! You used to be in the military! Does the Dominion hire sellswords?"
"115740052-0-16351";"Ha! What gave you that idea? … Seriously, keep down about that! I deserted, remember?"
"115740052-0-16352";"Ha! Coward."
"115740052-0-16353";"You weren't there! You would've fled too, if you'd seen what they asked us to do!"
"115740052-0-16354";"Both of you, calm down! <<1>>. Do they?"
"115740052-0-16355";"I don't know, sometimes? They have a lot of gold. When they hire mercenaries it's to fight someone they can't be bothered with or to chop an enemy down to size. If there's anything left you're paid well. If there isn't …."
"115740052-0-16356";"So, where are we goin'?"
"115740052-0-16357";"I'm thirsty. Let's find the inn."
"115740052-0-16358";"Why do you hesitate, girl? You cannot turn back now."
"115740052-0-16359";"We can't. They kicked us out, remember?"
"115740052-0-16360";"No. When?"
"115740052-0-16361";"Ha! Of course you don't remember! You were on your sixth flagon of Plum Brandy!"
"115740052-0-16362";"Six? That seems low."
"115740052-0-16363";"Theg, this was after three drams of White-Eye and a flagon of Moon-Sugar Double. You're lucky to be alive."
"115740052-0-16364";"Hmm. I forgot. They mix brews with moon-sugar, here."
"115740052-0-16365";"Yes, and in most Khajiiti ports. Now, let's think of a way out of this mess, shall we?"
"115740052-0-16366";"We must speak no more."
"115740052-0-16367";"Hey mortal! Come on over here!"
"115740052-0-16368";"I'm free of this place! Yes!"
"115740052-0-16369";"This disease … we've been here for weeks, and we still know nothing about it. If we can't understand how it's spread, how can we treat it?"
"115740052-0-16370";"We've already lost <<1>> and <<2>>! If we don't leave Orcrest now, the whole team will succumb!"
"115740052-0-16371";"Quickly. The Wilderking is weak. I must get him to the tower. You should come too."
"115740052-0-16372";"Quickly, I have opened another portal! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-16373";"Elphirion, General Malgoth and the rest of the Blackroot troops are almost upon us."
"115740052-0-16374";"Then it's time. Distribute the Nereid elixir and prepare to defend the village against the Blackroot."
"115740052-0-16375";"No, that plan is madness!"
"115740052-0-16376";"Silence, Glonnir. Our sacrifice today will ensure our sister villages live on."
"115740052-0-16377";"You mages are as treasonous as your scent is foul. We had an agreement."
"115740052-0-16378";"I have waited long for this."
"115740052-0-16379";"I have done nothing to your kind, and yet you come into my home, kill my thrall.\n\nYou had best live the rest of your life looking over your shoulder. My kind have ways of returning to finish our business."
"115740052-0-16380";"I can't hold this up much longer…"
"115740052-0-16381";"I beg you, stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-16382";"Don't be weak. Now stand aside, for I wish to feed."
"115740052-0-16383";"The flu has ravaged the city and the Colovians will be here in days. You have to get your daughter out of here!"
"115740052-0-16384";"No! I cannot allow this to go on!"
"115740052-0-16385";"Fool! Then I will take your blood myself!"
"115740052-0-16386";"The ward must not remain broken! Quickly! You must repair it!"
"115740052-0-16387";"Don't worry, this will get you inside with a minimum of fuss."
"115740052-0-16388";"One more after this one."
"115740052-0-16389";"Old friend, it's too late for me. Shazah is in your hands now. Get her home safely. I'll do what I can before the end."
"115740052-0-16390";"I'm afraid we might need to cut our walk short, Councilman."
"115740052-0-16391";"Quiet. We are being watched."
"115740052-0-16392";"We shall see, my pet."
"115740052-0-16393";"Shazah, please try to be brave. I'm sorry I won't be there for you and your sister, and I pray that the Flu never reaches Dune. Look after our family, and remember always. Your father loves you. Moons above, he loves you."
"115740052-0-16394";"Thiirril, you look simply ravishing today."
"115740052-0-16395";"Trouble the living no longer, lady of spiders!"
"115740052-0-16396";"And for your sins you are thus judged. The same fate awaits them all!"
"115740052-0-16397";"You thought you had escaped, but your fate was decided the moment I laid eyes on you, Faenir. There is nowhere your filth can run that I shan't follow!"
"115740052-0-16398";"Thanks for agreeing to find my lute. I'm going to make a run for it!"
"115740052-0-16399";"Dark Master, know that I remain ever faithful."
"115740052-0-16400";"This one waits and watches for your sign."
"115740052-0-16401";"The fate of Greenhill will be as nothing to Arenthia's fate."
"115740052-0-16402";"Just speak in her ear when Marasadra is to act."
"115740052-0-16403";"Please, Thiirril. Don't be that way. I've been so lonely."
"115740052-0-16404";"Here is another scene. Let's watch."
"115740052-0-16405";"Elphi, I can't do this. I'm scared. I don't want to die."
"115740052-0-16406";"No … I must pay for my crimes. I cannot live with this shame."
"115740052-0-16407";"An outsider pardons this traitor? I will have no part of it!"
"115740052-0-16408";"No! Ahhhhh!"
"115740052-0-16409";"Remember the master's riddle! Bow, and accept your exile with honor."
"115740052-0-16410";"I … forgive me. This is my duty. I accept it gladly."
"115740052-0-16411";"Ever shall you scour the sands, and protect our people. So it is written."
"115740052-0-16412";"Master … be at ease. I will protect the school in your place."
"115740052-0-16413";"Where are we? What is this place?"
"115740052-0-16414";"It's all right, Laenril. The poison itself is slow."
"115740052-0-16415";"The Blackroot will have cut our throats long before you felt its effects."
"115740052-0-16416";"Here. We'll drink it together and I'll fight by your side till the end."
"115740052-0-16417";"Until the end."
"115740052-0-16420";"My fate is sealed. I accept your judgment."
"115740052-0-16421";"This is madness! She only did this to help!"
"115740052-0-16422";"The curse is lifted. Go in peace."
"115740052-0-16423";"I am sorry, Tafa."
"115740052-0-16424";"Be at peace, friend. I will watch over the school."
"115740052-0-16426";"You're a fine figure of a woman, Engitaale. I love to watch you work."
"115740052-0-16427";"I cannot believe how afflicted we are, to have such a plague of beetles come upon us in this way."
"115740052-0-16428";"I have heard that bleak happenings likewise afflict the harbor in Sentinel."
"115740052-0-16429";"Zeht's Tears! We are beset by these tragedies most cruelly."
"115740052-0-16430";"You just don't think you like me, but you'll come around. I'm patient."
"115740052-0-16431";"There! That woman, follow her!"
"115740052-0-16432";"I think I can actually sense the blight attempting to corrupt my mind. I've never felt anything like this."
"115740052-0-16433";"You see! A vision of a Wood Elf. That must be where we should go. Come on, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-16434";"Jahi must be livid, to have such an infestation now."
"115740052-0-16435";"Why should it be that it would upset her more now than at any other time?"
"115740052-0-16436";"She has just brought on so much new help of late, it is likely costing her dearly each day that we have no water to sell."
"115740052-0-16437";"Greenhill has been lost to us."
"115740052-0-16438";"Stay where you are and remain our eyes and ears."
"115740052-0-16439";"Our mortal hands will reach out to you soon."
"115740052-0-16440";"Remain faithful dark sister."
"115740052-0-16441";"Hail, friend. I am glad you have come. I have forgivness to ask of you."
"115740052-0-16442";"What is this?"
"115740052-0-16443";"My brother and I threw the stones that broke your windows. I've some coin and a few goats you may take as recompense."
"115740052-0-16444";"Spare your apologies, Cro—I mean neighbor. I splintered your fence with a rake. By Zeht, I think we are even."
"115740052-0-16445";"We turned on each other so quickly. May those responsible eat sand for driving us to this."
"115740052-0-16446";"Master Pircalmo, Lady Alanya. Please accept my apology."
"115740052-0-16447";"Um, don't worry! I thought it was my fault too!"
"115740052-0-16448";"… What he means to say is, these sorts of misunderstandings happen. We're not the type to hold a grudge."
"115740052-0-16449";"Right. Yes. That. That's what I meant."
"115740052-0-16450";"I'd like to extend you a more permanent offer here. We could use someone with your diligence and knowledge."
"115740052-0-16451";"I don't really follow. I don't want to put Alanya at—"
"115740052-0-16452";"Dear, she's offering you a job. You'd be the town mage."
"115740052-0-16453";"Really? I mean, yes! Absolutely. Uh, if it's all right with you, dear."
"115740052-0-16454";"I think I'd quite like that. No more stone tables, though, Ranneth."
"115740052-0-16455";"It would be our honor to have you both here."
"115740052-0-16456";"Prepare the cave temple! It's a suitable place for a celebration."
"115740052-0-16457";"Hello, Angiente. If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone."
"115740052-0-16458";"I never see you doing any work, Angiente. You should try it. Now go away."
"115740052-0-16459";"Even the water here seems to be somehow tainted."
"115740052-0-16460";"The corruption has spread to these plants as well. It's like they're dead … but not dead at the same time."
"115740052-0-16461";"Burn!"
"115740052-0-16462";"You will die first."
"115740052-0-16463";"Your life ends now!"
"115740052-0-16464";"Why won't you die?"
"115740052-0-16465";"Into the ground. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-16466";"Quickly. Bury yourself!"
"115740052-0-16467";"Your bones will turn to ash!"
"115740052-0-16468";"Look. Another one."
"115740052-0-16469";"General Malgoth, the troops … half of them are dead! The other half …."
"115740052-0-16470";"Are dying, including us. This is poison. The villagers poisoned themselves to poison us."
"115740052-0-16471";"What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-16472";"The Meat Mandate you idiot! Elphirion knew she couldn't win on the field, but she'll still manage victory. To the Nereid temple. Perhaps we can beg a cure."
"115740052-0-16473";"Will there be no end to these interruptions?"
"115740052-0-16475";"Get my daughter out of here, Sergeant! I'll hold them off."
"115740052-0-16476";"Listen, everyone! We're going to the Hollow City. Anyone who doesn't want to leave can stay here with Bernt. But real Nords will come with me!"
"115740052-0-16477";"Captain, you have to pull back! There's too many of them!"
"115740052-0-16478";"It invoked the Right of Theft, and commanded we march against the Dominion."
"115740052-0-16479";"Place the essences in the magicka conduits. That should disrupt the binding spell that seals the cage."
"115740052-0-16480";"Good luck, and see you by the stones."
"115740052-0-16481";"Turn back…."
"115740052-0-16482";"Back to your master, wretched thing!"
"115740052-0-16483";"By Stendarr! Are you all right Aelif?"
"115740052-0-16484";"<<1>>! Thank the Hist!"
"115740052-0-16485";"What happened in there? How did these worms find the Forge?"
"115740052-0-16486";"We were finishing up when they appeared. They were after the crystal and tome. How did they know? How did they know about this place?"
"115740052-0-16487";"Aelif does not know. Merric, this whole thing is madness. She has us hunting Daedra, and now they come calling on our doorstep …."
"115740052-0-16488";"Aelif! Behind you!"
"115740052-0-16489";"Come face me, if it's the bow you desire."
"115740052-0-16490";"The bow is a boon to our army; you will not have it."
"115740052-0-16491";"You will soon join us and fight at Malgoth's side."
"115740052-0-16492";"I hope you've prepared for undeath."
"115740052-0-16493";"Naemon warned me about you, and I prepared."
"115740052-0-16494";"You will die, and then you will serve us!"
"115740052-0-16495";"You'll get used to this realm. As will all of Valenwood."
"115740052-0-16496";"Aelif, Merric. I do not rest easily."
"115740052-0-16497";"Dark moons! Guildmaster Iceblade, what's happening?"
"115740052-0-16498";"I was murdered, comrades. Seek my killer. Let me find peace."
"115740052-0-16499";"Jofnir, wait! Who killed you?"
"115740052-0-16500";"Interesting. Very interesting. Aelif has her suspicions."
"115740052-0-16501";"Our forces are gathered and the time has come to strike fast and strike hard. Time is not on our side, so we must make every moment count."
"115740052-0-16503";"Now. To battle!"
"115740052-0-16504";"It worked! I did it! I can't believe it!"
"115740052-0-16505";"Good luck."
"115740052-0-16506";"You've … freed us."
"115740052-0-16507";"Rid-Thar-ri'Datta … the First Mane?"
"115740052-0-16508";"You have arrived in Reaper's March at a critical time. The soul of the Khajiiti people, and the entire Dominion, are in crisis."
"115740052-0-16509";"What were you doing down there? You saw, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-16510";"The Wood Elf known as Finedrin has been found guilty of the following crimes …."
"115740052-0-16512";"Stealing rotten tomatoes and other refuse from stablemaster Semiral's midden-heap…."
"115740052-0-16513";"Dumping said refuse on the head of the Altmer commander, Faruin during his visit to the Clan Mother …."
"115740052-0-16514";"And finally, knocking over the cart of Atrius the merchant while attempting to avoid capture."
"115740052-0-16515";"For all of these crimes, this one sentences him to the stocks until such time as he shows proper repentance."
"115740052-0-16516";"This person is our enemy! Quickly! Kill the intruder!"
"115740052-0-16517";"Oh, you want heartwood? Please, take it. Just clutters up the place."
"115740052-0-16518";"Troops are already inside, fighting and holding ground, causing a distraction so that you can deal with Molag Bal's ability to call reinforcements."
"115740052-0-16519";"Enough with the games, Sheogorath. Are you going to relinquish the island to us or not?"
"115740052-0-16520";"I'm doing it this time, Atli. I'm going into that lake."
"115740052-0-16521";"Skordo the Knife, pride of the Fighters Guild, will aid you in your initial assault. Let his strength sweep away your foes and keep you safe."
"115740052-0-16522";"The lamia will join you for your initial assault. Allow her ferocity and determination to lead you to victory."
"115740052-0-16523";"Darien the Brave joins you on your first assault. Allow his courage to be your beacon in the darkness."
"115740052-0-16524";"Close the reinforcement portal. That is your first priority. Gabrielle and her forces will join you then for the push to the Labyrinth."
"115740052-0-16528";"That's nice, dear."
"115740052-0-16529";"All right, all right. Settle down. I'll just gather my things and go. Valaste! Dearie, why don't you come over here?"
"115740052-0-16530";"Once the Labyrinth is opened, you must make your way through Molag Bal's personal sanctum and find the portal to the planar vortex."
"115740052-0-16534";"That is your ultimate objective. If we are to end the Planemeld, we must disrupt the planar vortex and cease its destructive storm."
"115740052-0-16538";"Take your brave companion and venture forth! Close the reinforcement portal so that our forces can wage war on the Daedric Prince. Then open the Labyrinth and lead us to the planar vortex. Our destiny is in your hands!"
"115740052-0-16539";"Uncle Sheo? Are we going somewhere?"
"115740052-0-16540";"Yes, little one. You're coming with me. Home to the Shivering Isles! Won't that be nice?"
"115740052-0-16541";"Mad God, stay back! Valaste isn't yours to take!"
"115740052-0-16542";"Isn't she though? I can see it on her face, smell it in the air. She's crazy, mad, a lunatic. All that time with Uncle Sheo's stories and she's got the urge to visit the Isles. My Shivering Isles."
"115740052-0-16543";"I can do this. Nothing to it."
"115740052-0-16544";"Water sure looks cold."
"115740052-0-16545";"Too windy. Just too windy right now. I'll try again later."
"115740052-0-16546";"I'm back. I didn't jump in. It was too windy."
"115740052-0-16547";"Y'ffre's bones! What in Oblivion is he doing? We have to stop him! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-16548";"I'll begin the rebinding spell. You take care of that mage!"
"115740052-0-16549";"Now, use the blood rune on the final seal! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-16550";"That portal up there is our final destination? Doesn't seem too far. There is an entire army of Daedra between here and there, but it's not too far at all."
"115740052-0-16551";"You! Tharn wants to speak to you! Go to the Daggerfall Mages Guild! Quick quick!"
"115740052-0-16552";"You! Tharn wants to speak to you! Go to the Vulkhel Guard Mages Guild! Quick quick!"
"115740052-0-16553";"You! Tharn wants to speak to you! Go to the Davon's Watch Mages Guild! Quick quick!"
"115740052-0-16554";"I know, dear."
"115740052-0-16555";"Whew, it's cold out here."
"115740052-0-16556";"We need a launcher pointed in that direction! Brace for impact!"
"115740052-0-16560";"I cannot follow you into Tu'whacca's Sanctum. My mission leads elsewhere."
"115740052-0-16561";"Please Andur. Stop burning everything. The fire … it hurts."
"115740052-0-16562";"I will burn this entire forest down if I have to!"
"115740052-0-16563";"You will go no further."
"115740052-0-16564";"For Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-16565";"What? You son of a bitch!"
"115740052-0-16566";"Gah! Are you insane? Get away from me, you brutish she-troll!"
"115740052-0-16567";"Lyris! Stand down!"
"115740052-0-16568";"He's done nothing but lie to us from the beginning! I don't care what he says, he'll always be Mannimarco's toady!"
"115740052-0-16569";"Please. Mannimarco wants me dead! Did I pretend to capitulate to him? Yes, I did. Do you have any idea how many lives I saved by doing so?"
"115740052-0-16570";"The only thing you saved was your holdings and your own hide, you pompous ass!"
"115740052-0-16571";"Enough! Abnur had no choice, Lyris. And we are guilty of our own deceit, are we not? The time has come for the Vestige to know the truth!"
"115740052-0-16572";"What's this? The Vestige doesn't know? Oh, this is rich!"
"115740052-0-16573";"Vestige. Until now, you have only known me as the Prophet. But that is not my true name. I … am Varen Aquilarios!"
"115740052-0-16574";"Sire, don't …!"
"115740052-0-16575";"Our fallen Emperor, in the tattered robes of a Moth Priest, blind as a newborn kitten!"
"115740052-0-16576";"I am sorry I deceived you, Vestige."
"115740052-0-16577";"I do! I want to go with Uncle Sheo! He's got the butterflies! I love butterflies!"
"115740052-0-16578";"Hmm, this is a conundrum. A riddle, a … choice. I tell you what, mortal. Why don't we let you decide? Should Valaste stay? Or come with me to the dear old Isles?"
"115740052-0-16579";"I'm going to stay right here. For … tactical reasons.\n\nI have full confidence in your ability to handle this."
"115740052-0-16580";"I'll be right down!"
"115740052-0-16581";"Snakes! Giant snakes, coming from the sea!"
"115740052-0-16582";"That poor Netch. It must have been wounded by the Dwemer constructs."
"115740052-0-16583";"Stand back. We don't know what it's capable of."
"115740052-0-16584";"It's a Netch. They're the most docile—"
"115740052-0-16585";"Y'ffre's bones! The corruption is coming from the den of the Eldest! We need to get there—quickly!"
"115740052-0-16586";"The mortal's decided to let Valaste stay! So, this is where I say my goodbyes. Mortal, nice working with you! Shalidor … never change."
"115740052-0-16587";"Yes, I'm … all right, Shalidor. I'm myself again."
"115740052-0-16588";"Valaste … are you?"
"115740052-0-16589";"Have you heard what happened in Arenthia? Damned Collies have taken the city."
"115740052-0-16590";"Well, you'd better settle in. I hear their General is like fire from Oblivion."
"115740052-0-16591";"The mortal's decided to let Valaste go with me! Valaste, dearie, come on over. You're coming with Uncle Sheo."
"115740052-0-16592";"Moons above, I hope so. Heh, if all of your people are like you Ciramaire, Arenthia will have a long time to wait."
"115740052-0-16593";"My wife's sister lived there, yeah. She's come to live with us."
"115740052-0-16594";"Don't worry. The Eagles will kick them out. That's why we formed the alliance, right?"
"115740052-0-16595";"Bah! Stuff your Moons into your fur, Aru."
"115740052-0-16596";"Yay! The butterflies! I love to watch them flutter!"
"115740052-0-16599";"He's … he's won again. Please don't take her, Mad God!"
"115740052-0-16600";"Oh, don't worry, she's in good hands! And this is where I say my farewells. Mortal, nice working with you! Shalidor … never change. Say goodbye, dearie."
"115740052-0-16601";"It's not safe to talk in the streets. Now, I can speak openly."
"115740052-0-16602";"Goodbye! I'll miss you!"
"115740052-0-16603";"Until next time, Magelings!"
"115740052-0-16604";"You can turn around now."
"115740052-0-16606";"What am I looking at?"
"115740052-0-16607";"Have you heard? Some bandits looted a temple of Arkay in Cyrodiil."
"115740052-0-16608";"Did you move the trees?"
"115740052-0-16609";"And the rocks. They frame the lighthouse nicely, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-16610";"Word is they're holed up in Fort Sphinxmoth, far to the north."
"115740052-0-16611";"Not surprising, really. With the fighting in Cyrodiil, the Imperials eat each other alive."
"115740052-0-16612";"Aranias. You cannot just…"
"115740052-0-16613";"I need to sit down."
"115740052-0-16614";"I can't … contain it … I'm sorry!"
"115740052-0-16615";"Stop! Don't hurt her! Pariel, it's me!"
"115740052-0-16616";"Oh, my beloved. What has happened to you?"
"115740052-0-16617";"Don't worry, my love. Hircine will answer my prayers. We will be together."
"115740052-0-16618";"Peace, my love. It will all be over soon."
"115740052-0-16619";"Forgive me."
"115740052-0-16620";"I got the barrier down. Molag Grunda has to know we're coming. The Chasm is nearly ours!"
"115740052-0-16621";"Y'ffre guide me. I hope this works."
"115740052-0-16623";"Free at last!"
"115740052-0-16625";"By the Eight. Indaenir!"
"115740052-0-16626";"What happened here?"
"115740052-0-16627";"Look. Indaenir."
"115740052-0-16628";"Perhaps you should take a few steps back, Mane?"
"115740052-0-16629";"To me, my friends!"
"115740052-0-16631";"I'm sorry!"
"115740052-0-16632";"You're lucky they're alive! How many more ships will you sink?"
"115740052-0-16633";"It was an accident."
"115740052-0-16634";"Accidents are spilling water. Dropping glass. You lifted a ship out of the ocean with a wall of rock!"
"115740052-0-16635";"I didn't mean to. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-16636";"Your mother and I will discuss your punishment. Go!"
"115740052-0-16637";"How did you get over here?"
"115740052-0-16638";"I am not so decrepit I am incapable of leaping from one rock to the next."
"115740052-0-16639";"I'm sorry I missed that."
"115740052-0-16640";"Who were you talking to a moment ago?"
"115740052-0-16641";"You're old. You were hearing things."
"115740052-0-16642";"Aranias. You were talking to someone. Who was it?"
"115740052-0-16643";"It was the island."
"115740052-0-16644";"I don't understand."
"115740052-0-16646";"This island has fed and sheltered me all my life. It'll never leave me and I'll never leave it."
"115740052-0-16647";"You have done well, friend. Come, I would have words with you."
"115740052-0-16648";"Your hide will make a wonderful rug for the master.\n\nSurrender, and I'll devour you quickly."
"115740052-0-16649";"This is my home. We can speak privately inside."
"115740052-0-16650";"Oh look, more gloom and death."
"115740052-0-16651";"Follow me. I know a shortcut."
"115740052-0-16653";"Don't be frightened. This is a friend."
"115740052-0-16654";"The harpies are not our enemies. Will you help me convince the others?"
"115740052-0-16655";"Wait, why are you in my tent? Who are you?"
"115740052-0-16656";"Receive the touch of the first Mane. And exult in the moonlight."
"115740052-0-16666";"Selene protects! Selene destroys! Selene will rule all!"
"115740052-0-16672";"You father and I leave for Summerset in the morning."
"115740052-0-16673";"I won't do it again, I promise. I'll try harder. Don't leave me behind."
"115740052-0-16674";"Don't grovel. It's unbecoming. We will return with help to control your temper."
"115740052-0-16675";"How much more can I apologize? I said I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-16676";"No, Ara. It's just … you need training. What you did to the ship, that scares people."
"115740052-0-16677";"What sort of training, Father?"
"115740052-0-16678";"Go back to selling trinkets, Leja. You do your job, and we'll do ours."
"115740052-0-16679";"You hid those eggs on purpose, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-16680";"See? I knew that would work! A word of advice. Guard your pluckables. Grunda enjoys plucking out eyes, spleens … anything pluckable, really."
"115740052-0-16681";"Say no more, child. We haven't time for troublemakers."
"115740052-0-16682";"They're up to something. They must be."
"115740052-0-16695";"Good luck with … whatever it was, mortal!"
"115740052-0-16696";"Furthermore, the coucil has decided to expel you from the Fighters Guild. We will report you to the proper authorities for the murder of Jofnir Iceblade. You are dismissed."
"115740052-0-16697";"Yes, countess. I understand."
"115740052-0-16698";"The Valenheart … it saved Indaenir!"
"115740052-0-16699";"Saved him? Cariel?"
"115740052-0-16700";"The Valenwood brought him back! It's Y'ffre's will."
"115740052-0-16701";"What happened?"
"115740052-0-16702";"Indaenir, you're … Y'ffre has chosen you. You're the Silvenar."
"115740052-0-16703";"I'm going to go let Raz know. I'm sure he's pushed into the grotto by now with the Vinedusks."
"115740052-0-16704";"Yes, and Queen Ayrenn must be informed as well."
"115740052-0-16705";"Insolent intruder! The mage belongs to me!"
"115740052-0-16706";"This is getting tiresome. I almost preferred the harpies."
"115740052-0-16707";"Harpies are the least of your problems if you don't pay up."
"115740052-0-16708";"Good. I'll be back next week. Prices might be going up."
"115740052-0-16709";"Come on, <<1>>. Merciful Ruptga, how long must we put up with these thieves!"
"115740052-0-16710";"We've got your gold. No need to make threats."
"115740052-0-16711";"Let's see it then. Better not've shorted me."
"115740052-0-16712";"It's all there. We don't want to end up like the others."
"115740052-0-16713";"Dark moons, another barrier. I grow tired of this."
"115740052-0-16714";"My friend, you've done it! Quickly now, you must run!"
"115740052-0-16715";"Khali's blade is yours, my new friend."
"115740052-0-16716";"I fight for the warriors! The Hist tree must endure!"
"115740052-0-16717";"I fight for the scholars! The Hist tree's suffering must end."
"115740052-0-16718";"There! Get those senche to rest. Khali will handle the crystal."
"115740052-0-16719";"Another one that didn't make it. We are running out of defenders Gilraen."
"115740052-0-16720";"We have to hold out as long as we can. You know the plan. We hold the center until we can muster the strength to make a final advance on Erthas."
"115740052-0-16721";"We know the plan Gilraen but the longer we wait, the less we have to make that push. We have to move now."
"115740052-0-16722";"If we pull in our troops now we'll face the followers of Dagon at our backs as soon as we make our push. We'll be slaughtered. You know this Elolir."
"115740052-0-16723";"This will only take a moment. Glad I paid attention to the monk's lessons."
"115740052-0-16724";"There, done."
"115740052-0-16725";"What do we do now than? We're getting slaughtered."
"115740052-0-16726";"Laeneval, see if you can aid those defenders. They'll need your healing before the battle is done."
"115740052-0-16727";"Mortals are always so amusing. I offer information, aid for your quest, and you shun me."
"115740052-0-16728";"You expect us to trust a creature of the planes? Ridiculous!"
"115740052-0-16729";"You can destroy the Eldest but you cannot have the heart. It belongs here in the Shadow Wood. You will bring it to me."
"115740052-0-16730";"A mer as arrogant as a kyn. How delightful! I do so love watching egotistical braggarts stumble."
"115740052-0-16731";"Be gone, foul creature! We don't have time for your games."
"115740052-0-16732";"I may allow you to reconsider and accept my offer. Of course, I may not. I haven't decided yet."
"115740052-0-16733";"You there. Find out where that creature is lurking. I want her watched."
"115740052-0-16734";"I'll see what I can do."
"115740052-0-16735";"Is this all you've got, you bastards? Come at me!"
"115740052-0-16736";"I can hear him! I'm coming Uncle Sheo!"
"115740052-0-16737";"They're coming through the gates again! We've got to stop them!"
"115740052-0-16738";"Nice work! They'll think twice before they try to get down here again. I'll stand guard while you restore the mages' portal."
"115740052-0-16739";"Die, Colovian dogs!"
"115740052-0-16740";"Hah. They sent a house cat to fight their battles. Desperate failure."
"115740052-0-16741";"Khali … Shazah … be safe …."
"115740052-0-16742";"Let's get moving. We can do this."
"115740052-0-16743";"That was fun! Meet us outside when you're ready."
"115740052-0-16744";"As soon as I sensed that you sealed Molag Bal's portal, I figured it was safe enough to follow you."
"115740052-0-16745";"Yes, Queen Ayrenn. Akkhuz-ri witnessed Indaenir's rebirth."
"115740052-0-16746";"His spirit was gone from the mortal world. The Valenwood restored him."
"115740052-0-16747";"Indaenir?"
"115740052-0-16748";"The Mane speaks the truth, Queen Ayrenn."
"115740052-0-16749";"Cariel herself said Y'ffre chose him. This one agrees."
"115740052-0-16750";"Then rise Indaenir. It is I who have the honor of bowing to you."
"115740052-0-16751";"Queen Ayrenn, please. I —"
"115740052-0-16752";"People of the Aldmeri Dominion. I present to you, your new Silvenar."
"115740052-0-16753";"Come, you must leave this place! Follow me!"
"115740052-0-16754";"Count your victories while you may. Your every step brings the heart closer to me."
"115740052-0-16755";"Gabrielle has assembled a team of mages and scholars to aid you inside the Labyrinth, as we need all of the fighters for the main assault."
"115740052-0-16756";"Elolir, go check on those defenders. They took a big hit with the last wave and I want them to be ready for whatever comes next."
"115740052-0-16757";"I'll make sure they're ready."
"115740052-0-16758";"Yes. Bring me the heart, and I will grant you a merciful death. Maybe."
"115740052-0-16759";"Let's just hope we can hold."
"115740052-0-16760";"Your hopeless heroism ends here!"
"115740052-0-16761";"That was fun, but I guess the main assault needs me. Don't get yourself killed while I'm gone."
"115740052-0-16762";"At attention, whelps! We've got a challenger!"
"115740052-0-16763";"Look alive out there! I don't want to see sloppy swordsmanship!"
"115740052-0-16764";"This one cannot comprehend … all of this by his hand?"
"115740052-0-16765";"Akkhuz-ri … this one should have fought harder. Fought against the darkness. But he was weak."
"115740052-0-16766";"Well done! Fadalia will be eager to see you after that showing!"
"115740052-0-16767";"This one is no longer fit to wear the Mane. That much is clear now. All must be told of his decision."
"115740052-0-16768";"I command here! Die!"
"115740052-0-16769";"I'll let the others know that you've got a way in!"
"115740052-0-16770";"The master's secret must be revealed …."
"115740052-0-16771";"This hallowed ground is cursed with our blood."
"115740052-0-16772";"She hasn't the strength. You must be stronger."
"115740052-0-16773";"Another fine batch of flesh! Fadalia, you've done well."
"115740052-0-16774";"You've done well! Now, we must secure this place."
"115740052-0-16775";"Children of the sea! Your bonds cannot hold the tempest!"
"115740052-0-16776";"My sister's pawn, come once more to do her bidding."
"115740052-0-16777";"Ayrenn will get what's coming to her soon enough."
"115740052-0-16778";"Your cause is hopeless, and you are outmatched."
"115740052-0-16779";"Why won't you just die?"
"115740052-0-16780";"The entrance is hidden in plain sight."
"115740052-0-16781";"I must call an arbiter to oversee my punishment. Leki protect you, friend."
"115740052-0-16782";"It's working. Just a little more."
"115740052-0-16783";"The fools haven't the strength to face me, so they send an outsider? Pitiful."
"115740052-0-16784";"I'll enjoy adding your skull to my collection!"
"115740052-0-16785";"I have achieved immortality!"
"115740052-0-16786";"This … can't be!"
"115740052-0-16787";"appears to want to turn around."
"115740052-0-16788";"Another obstacle. Look how the rubble blocks those doors. Come talk to me when you have a moment."
"115740052-0-16789";"Too… many. They are throwing everything at the gate.\n\nI just need to catch my breath…"
"115740052-0-16790";"Good. This should work."
"115740052-0-16791";"Hurry! We have to save the Heart!"
"115740052-0-16793";"Thanks to my sister, I am restored, and now … I will have my vengeance!"
"115740052-0-16794";"You've disgraced our town long enough!"
"115740052-0-16795";"Ugh! A rotten egg? Don't think this is over, child!"
"115740052-0-16796";"Gather everyone who will stand with us to drive these bad eggs out of town!"
"115740052-0-16797";"Father. The dead can't offer their forgiveness, but I can. Stand with us."
"115740052-0-16798";"Rise minions!"
"115740052-0-16799";"Stop them, before it's too late!"
"115740052-0-16800";"I don't know if the harpies will ever be able to trust us."
"115740052-0-16801";"Maybe this is the first step. What do you think?"
"115740052-0-16802";"There you are, you swindler!"
"115740052-0-16803";"Giant snake glands? I think these are edible, but don't these things attract other snakes?"
"115740052-0-16804";"By the Unwritten Law, <<1>> must answer the outsider's challenge."
"115740052-0-16805";"I will cleanse the blade. You keep them off of me!"
"115740052-0-16806";"We did it! I think."
"115740052-0-16807";"Well, isn't that nice? Molag Bal, the grateful Prince that he is, has sent out a welcoming committee!"
"115740052-0-16808";"Can we get a move on? These things stink something awful. Besides, we must be close to the portal by now."
"115740052-0-16809";"Why do the mission objectives always have such large and powerful guardians?"
"115740052-0-16810";"Well done, my friend! We make an excellent team, if I do say so myself."
"115740052-0-16811";"Tu'whacca says to keep it up. You are doing a good job."
"115740052-0-16812";"Yes! Yes! We are close now!"
"115740052-0-16813";"Don't lose hope, my friend. We're depending on you!"
"115740052-0-16814";"That's It! Just a bit more!"
"115740052-0-16815";"There! It is done! Come quickly now! We must stop this woman Shiri! Meet me at the central tomb!"
"115740052-0-16816";"What, what's going on? I'm up, I'm awake."
"115740052-0-16817";"If I have to dump one more cartload of bodies, I'm going to scream."
"115740052-0-16818";"Fool! Just do it and shut up for one more day."
"115740052-0-16819";"Then we can leave, get out of this cursed place?"
"115740052-0-16820";"Yes. I've stolen almost everything we need. One more day and we'll be ready."
"115740052-0-16821";"I need to get back. See you later."
"115740052-0-16822";"Bah! I'll kill you myself!"
"115740052-0-16823";"I can't take this anymore. Why must we stay?"
"115740052-0-16824";"Hush, Cloelia! They'll hear you."
"115740052-0-16825";"I don't care anymore, I can't live like this. I want to go home!"
"115740052-0-16826";"We have no home to go back to, darling. We need to wait until this is over, one way or another. Then we can rebuild. But we need to be patient."
"115740052-0-16827";"Patience! You are a font of patience. You have nothing but patience. Try doing something for a change!"
"115740052-0-16830";"My lost clan awaits Seris in the darkness. Even though the blade that banished him was not in my hand, his end was my doing."
"115740052-0-16831";"You have been a most useful weapon, little mortal. Take the Labyrinth key, with my thanks."
"115740052-0-16834";"You will pay for killing my brothers! This is for Uwafa! This is for Alasan!"
"115740052-0-16835";"My father will soon be raised. There is nothing you can do."
"115740052-0-16836";"And this is for all my family! I die, but my father will avenge me! Suturah will avenge us all!"
"115740052-0-16837";"I recognize this moment. The day the Elden Accord was signed! The Mane was a good leader, Hallowed. A good soul."
"115740052-0-16838";"The day, so long ago, Rid-Thar-ri'Datta first became Mane. A controversial moment, at the time. But an important moment for my people."
"115740052-0-16839";"Khali was so angry. We both were. The priests were never very kind to us … but look at you and I today. Khali … I wish you were here."
"115740052-0-16840";"Look up there! The top of the central pillar."
"115740052-0-16841";"Drown in the river, Breton. I never agreed to this."
"115740052-0-16842";"Back up, lizard. Your breath offends me. And you most certainly did agree to this."
"115740052-0-16843";"No! I've been in close contact with the Hidden Armigers. They were angling for a kill on that Cariel wench."
"115740052-0-16844";"This is what I'm saying. You agreed to the documents in exchange for her location. The Ring of Daggers had what you wanted."
"115740052-0-16845";"Enough talk of spy networks. We'll talk about this again tonight."
"115740052-0-16846";"How do you explain this, lizard? We had a deal."
"115740052-0-16847";"Yes, Argonian. I recall the details of the deal quite clearly."
"115740052-0-16848";"And the loss of a hundred troops was not in the deal!"
"115740052-0-16849";"Pah, you are both overreacting. What do you care for front-line soldiers? You both received your shipments."
"115740052-0-16850";"This kind of attack draws attention, lizard. Play us like this again, and you'll learn that cats have sharper claws by far."
"115740052-0-16851";"We have an opportunity to replace the battlereeve. Ayrenn's head of military matters could be taken out, easily. And perhaps replaced with one of our own?"
"115740052-0-16852";"Tantalizing, Ren-dro. I'll have to talk with the Armigers to see what kind of payment we could offer."
"115740052-0-16853";"Don't wait for their pitiful offer, Ren-dro. The Ring of Daggers knew this was coming. We have a tentative offer. Here."
"115740052-0-16854";"Three estates in Cyrodiil? A tract of land in Stonefalls? Isn't this offer a bit presumptive, Ren-Dro?"
"115740052-0-16855";"The lizard is right, Cassel. Your next offer had best not be built on promises and lies."
"115740052-0-16856";"All right, let's head out. We've got portals to stabilize, you know!"
"115740052-0-16857";"<<1>> is mine!"
"115740052-0-16858";"All right. Farvad, Talia … you know what to do."
"115740052-0-16859";"All right, let us open the door then."
"115740052-0-16861";"Tu'whacca demands justice be done!"
"115740052-0-16864";"Yes! That did it. Lead on."
"115740052-0-16865";"Tu'whacca walks with you, and so will I."
"115740052-0-16867";"This wall will not stand before the power of an Ansei Ward."
"115740052-0-16868";"It is done. Tu'whacca says it is time for us to go in."
"115740052-0-16869";"Excellent. We shall put down Shiri as my father put down Suturah before."
"115740052-0-16870";"It is done. Lead on."
"115740052-0-16871";"It is done. Alik'r is safe again. Come, hero. Gather my ward."
"115740052-0-16872";"I have opened a portal to Sentinel. You three may enter, but I must speak with your friend."
"115740052-0-16873";"Get out of my way, girl. I have no patience for this!"
"115740052-0-16875";"I thought I would be more satisfied at his death. I guess it won't bring back those he's killed."
"115740052-0-16876";"(THIS SHOULD NOT PLAY)"
"115740052-0-16877";"Hopefully, that's the last of the veil. Let's see if we can get through that door now."
"115740052-0-16879";"I live … again! And you … you will die!"
"115740052-0-16880";"You!"
"115740052-0-16881";"Sir!"
"115740052-0-16882";"Get the Fighters Guild to provide security for the meeting. We wouldn't want our illustrious Alliance leaders to wind up dead, would we?"
"115740052-0-16883";"Right away, sir!"
"115740052-0-16884";"You!"
"115740052-0-16885";"Yes, sir!"
"115740052-0-16886";"Here's the coordinates for the island of Stirk. Take a couple of people with you and port over. Make sure it's safe and establish a temporary camp there."
"115740052-0-16887";"I'll get on that, sir!"
"115740052-0-16888";"You're still here? Get a move on and meet your spymaster. We've got a lot of work ahead of us."
"115740052-0-16889";"There's the sarcophagus. Open it, quickly!"
"115740052-0-16890";"I should think you've gotten quite enough of running blindly into draugr-filled caves. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-16891";"Oh, yes please. Let's do get out of here."
"115740052-0-16892";"But, I wanted to punch a draugr!"
"115740052-0-16893";"Jofarr, outside is where they keep the mead."
"115740052-0-16894";"An excellent point. Let's be off, then!"
"115740052-0-16895";"Well, that was easy. Come on, Borald."
"115740052-0-16896";"At last!"
"115740052-0-16897";"Wait for her to leave. I must speak with you."
"115740052-0-16898";"The Lava Queen doesn't abide cheaters. Time to die!"
"115740052-0-16899";"I smash you to bits!"
"115740052-0-16900";"You don't belong here, heathen! The Obsidian Husk is a holy stone, not fit for your filthy hands!"
"115740052-0-16901";"I tire of waiting. What news from the General, much honor be upon him?"
"115740052-0-16902";"The runner has not yet returned, ma'am. I am certain that our great leader is attending to vital business. If I may venture a suggestion, perhaps we -"
"115740052-0-16903";"I know that the General has forbidden executions until the Withered Hand has been dealt with, but these scheming asps represent the worst of Sep's children. Ourkinsmen suffered unspeakable shame at their hands, and I will not see them ransomed."
"115740052-0-16904";"From the icy tundra of Whiterun, the most dangerous beast the frozen reaches have ever spawned!"
"115740052-0-16905";"Prepare yourself, combatants! Pray to your gods and make your peace. You face the Stinger!"
"115740052-0-16906";"This way."
"115740052-0-16907";"I can finally close my eyes."
"115740052-0-16908";"Job for Cariel!"
"115740052-0-16909";"We have a new contender!"
"115740052-0-16910";"And here's the release! Look at them go!"
"115740052-0-16911";"No way. Do it yourself."
"115740052-0-16912";"What? Why?"
"115740052-0-16913";"A magnificent upset! The newcomer wins!"
"115740052-0-16914";"And it's over!"
"115740052-0-16915";"I am certain that the General has plans for them. With respect, we should wait for his ruling."
"115740052-0-16916";"<<1>> is a homicidal maniac, and <<2>>? Let's just say I'm not her favorite person."
"115740052-0-16917";"You are right, private - of course. But there is no harm in being prepared. Tell the men to assemble a detail - five bowmen with sharp eyes and stone hearts … and I suppose a priest as well. Even these dogs deserve Tu'whacca's last rites."
"115740052-0-16918";"Why is <<1>> displeased with Cariel?"
"115740052-0-16919";"I may have collapsed a building on top of her. Accidentally."
"115740052-0-16920";"Ah, yes. This one forgot about that. \n\nVery well. Raz will take care of it. And he will send <<1>> your warmest regards."
"115740052-0-16921";"Damn you, Lyranth! I see your hand in this. I'll make sure you join your clan in the darkness."
"115740052-0-16922";"Mortal fools, duped by an outcast kyn. I will take great pleasure in ending your lives!"
"115740052-0-16923";"Dammit, Raz, not so close!"
"115740052-0-16924";"The word has been given."
"115740052-0-16925";"Come forth, children of the dark moon!"
"115740052-0-16927";"A moment, please."
"115740052-0-16928";"I grow weary of your meddling. Prepare to die!"
"115740052-0-16929";"Our representative, Captain Alphaury, is in charge of security on Stirk. He assures us that all is well there, but keep your wits about you. Good luck."
"115740052-0-16930";"Please. Don't let them hurt me. Not again, not like … please."
"115740052-0-16931";"There we are. After you, your majesty."
"115740052-0-16933";"I'll wait for you on the other side."
"115740052-0-16934";"Meet me below the Wood Orc fort. The Orcs must pay."
"115740052-0-16935";"You can't stop <<1>>. Hail Sithis!"
"115740052-0-16936";"A search party won't be necessary, Laurosse. It seems you still have much to learn about me."
"115740052-0-16937";"Erinel! I'm so glad to see you, though your presence is … something of a surprise. I should have known you'd navigate the woods with ease."
"115740052-0-16938";"You should have, my sweet. And if you ever call me 'delicate' again … well, those aren't words for polite company."
"115740052-0-16939";"Indeed, my dear. You have me at a loss again."
"115740052-0-16940";"No! Damn you, First Mane!"
"115740052-0-16941";"Sister! Please reconsider!"
"115740052-0-16942";"This is the way it must be. Sister, do not weep for me."
"115740052-0-16943";"Friend, it is Azei! I must speak with you!"
"115740052-0-16944";"There has to be a way to get out of here … wait a moment … something bad is about to happen …."
"115740052-0-16945";"This creature is now contained. Leave this place … sister."
"115740052-0-16946";"Sometimes I hate it when I'm right. Here they come!"
"115740052-0-16947";"Come on! We need to find a way out of here."
"115740052-0-16948";"I need to get this door open. Hold them off while I work on this!"
"115740052-0-16949";"Pssst. Over here. This one used an illusion spell. Very little effort."
"115740052-0-16950";"The door's finally open! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-16951";"Fjar, reporting in, sir."
"115740052-0-16952";"Not rid of me yet. Sir."
"115740052-0-16953";"Returning to duty."
"115740052-0-16954";"<<1>> is tainted by evil. He will never again be fit to lead our people."
"115740052-0-16955";"Our hope lies with these women, the Champions. One of them will be Mane. You must help them walk the Path … for you are the Moon Hallowed."
"115740052-0-16956";"Without a new Mane, the Khajiit will fall. The Dominion will fall. Walk well in the light of Jode and Jone, and you shall succeed. Moon Hallowed."
"115740052-0-16957";"That giant portal up ahead is the thing we need to smash? Hopefully this won't be too easy."
"115740052-0-16958";"Been a while since we heard from you, sweetheart. We started thinking you might have run off. But you wouldn't do that, would you?"
"115740052-0-16959";"Oh no, I wouldn't think of doing that. We are all friends here—is it not so?"
"115740052-0-16960";"Yeah, we're all friends here. You're smart, Feraj. 'Course, being smart doesn't make up for being late. And you are very late."
"115740052-0-16961";"The days have not been kind to us. You see, the harpies … please, just a few more days!  I will pay what you are owed—with interest!"
"115740052-0-16962";"I have to be honest with you, Feraj. That's not what I wanted to hear. So it's either the money or your teeth. I'll give you a minute to decide which."
"115740052-0-16963";"So, what's the bet?"
"115740052-0-16964";"A hundred gold says there's an attempt on our lives within the week."
"115740052-0-16965";"That's a sucker bet! The Hidden Armigers have hit us at least once a week for the past three months."
"115740052-0-16966";"All right. Three hundred says when the Dominion spies contact us, it'll be Cariel, not Razum-dar."
"115740052-0-16967";"Cariel? That wench knows better than to show her face around me. Mark my words, I'm going to have to hunt her down to slit her throat."
"115740052-0-16968";"And after you do, that three hundred gold will buy you enough ale to celebrate for a year!"
"115740052-0-16969";"I'll take that bet!"
"115740052-0-16970";"And share the ale, if you win. Let's go. We have a lot of work to do."
"115740052-0-16971";"Ah, health and vitality! Welcome back!"
"115740052-0-16972";"And now stamina returns. How I've missed you, old friend!"
"115740052-0-16974";"For the initial assault, Cadwell will assist you. Don't be fooled by his bizarre antics, for his heart is full of courage and honor."
"115740052-0-16979";"No! What's happening to me?"
"115740052-0-16980";"Is it true? Did Hilka really sell us out?"
"115740052-0-16981";"It seems so."
"115740052-0-16982";"Come on, Hald. You know how angry she is. I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner."
"115740052-0-16983";"Yeah, but treason? Doesn't that seem a bit too, I dunno, subtle? Besides, she's the most patriotic of all of us."
"115740052-0-16989";"Turns out I'm glad you came, Virian. I'm calling in that favor."
"115740052-0-16990";"Overcompensation."
"115740052-0-16991";"You mean you called me here without knowing if you needed me, Thrush? Ugh. What's the favor?"
"115740052-0-16992";"Yeah. Maybe."
"115740052-0-16993";"I need you to contact the other spy networks, the Eyes of the Queen of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Ring of Daggers in the Daggerfall Covenant."
"115740052-0-16994";"Is someone out there? I'm in a cocoon! Help!"
"115740052-0-16996";"I knew that coward was a liability. If I ever see Hald again I'll gut him myself."
"115740052-0-16997";"Get off it, Hilka. You can't honestly think Hald was capable of this."
"115740052-0-16998";"Why because he had it rough? That only makes him more susceptible. He didn't have the stomach for the work anymore. Kind of like some other people I know."
"115740052-0-16999";"All right, knock it. Let's just get through the rest of today without losing anyone else."
"115740052-0-17000";"Over here. I know what Talmo wants. But I have an alternative proposal for you."
"115740052-0-17001";"Fjar was the traitor? Family-man Fjar? I could kill that Daedra-spawn. Thragof, give me a month and dispensation, and I'll have his entire family in Pact hands."
"115740052-0-17002";"Stendarr's Mercy, Hilka. Don't you think that's taking it a bit far?"
"115740052-0-17003";"Contact. You do mean with the tips of my daggers. Repeatedly. Right?"
"115740052-0-17004";"A traitor's a traitor, Hald. All traitors get what's coming to them."
"115740052-0-17005";"No, no, this is a diplomacy thing. No killing."
"115740052-0-17006";"Waste of a favor, Thrush. Should've asked for something your lackeys couldn't do. We're even after this, you know."
"115740052-0-17007";"No! This cannot be!"
"115740052-0-17008";"I know, but this is important. Thanks, Naryu."
"115740052-0-17009";"Nobody's getting anything right now. Cool off, the both of you. Fjar's not getting away from us. If the higher ups want Fjar, you'll be the first to know."
"115740052-0-17010";"Murderer! I will crack open your bones!"
"115740052-0-17011";"My son! You took my son!"
"115740052-0-17012";"You've come too late. The ritual has begun, and you cannot strike me down."
"115740052-0-17013";"Gadris' teleport spell worked! This one is here! Be careful, friend. The Dwarven constructs have awakened."
"115740052-0-17015";"Whatever you say, Thrush."
"115740052-0-17016";"Over here! The constructs have moved away from the forge."
"115740052-0-17017";"Here they come!"
"115740052-0-17018";"Ready!"
"115740052-0-17019";"Fire!"
"115740052-0-17020";"Another little skeever? We'll gut you like the others."
"115740052-0-17021";"Get out! Get out of my house!"
"115740052-0-17022";"I'll even ride with you as far as Auridon. Let's go."
"115740052-0-17023";"Dro-m'Athra, free yourselves and destroy the intruder!"
"115740052-0-17026";"They won't see reason. Their hatred runs too deep."
"115740052-0-17027";"Some wounds take longer to heal. They have an abundance of time to learn that lesson."
"115740052-0-17028";"The barrier is down! But before we proceed, I need to speak with you."
"115740052-0-17030";"Once the Drom'Athra are free, all of Reaper's March shall be ours!"
"115740052-0-17031";"It's done. They're all dead."
"115740052-0-17033";"It's not enough. For what you're asking, I need more."
"115740052-0-17034";"How can I possibly deliver the whole village?"
"115740052-0-17035";"Your village sits below a volcano. Volcanoes erupt. With the right prodding."
"115740052-0-17036";"Now, Nidras …. Hmm. I guess he went upstairs. That boy's steps are as light as feathers."
"115740052-0-17037";"The floodwaters rise! Our deal is good then, yes?"
"115740052-0-17038";"Yes. The village will be ours, and you shall have your gold."
"115740052-0-17039";"Oh, how exciting! I wonder if I should've washed my hair first …. Nah!"
"115740052-0-17040";"Denthis, Dithis! You two guard the portal. Tell anyone coming through to push ahead. The source of the reinforcements must be cut off!"
"115740052-0-17041";"I'll scout on ahead. We need to know what we're going to face at that gatehouse."
"115740052-0-17042";"I will not stand for this! I won't let you harm my children!"
"115740052-0-17043";"Excellent! Now, how do I get out of here?"
"115740052-0-17044";"That was not part of our deal. Enjoy your gold."
"115740052-0-17045";"More of them coming! Keep those bows ready!"
"115740052-0-17046";"It is done. Soon, your father will be dead."
"115740052-0-17047";"Then at last, I will lead."
"115740052-0-17048";"You will, indeed, rule at last. When the rockslide swallows the entire stronghold."
"115740052-0-17049";"What fortune!"
"115740052-0-17053";"Hmm. Perhaps <<1>> should examine her purchase."
"115740052-0-17055";"I've fought beside each of you. I know you're worthy of  Sovngarde. It won't be long before we feast together in the Hall of Valor!"
"115740052-0-17056";"No! I won't let you harm my children!"
"115740052-0-17058";"No! What are you doing? No!"
"115740052-0-17059";"You're no guard. Grab that key on the table and open these cages!"
"115740052-0-17060";"Another successful mission, but we're not finished yet!"
"115740052-0-17061";"The diversion I set up is working. Hurry before the Daedra notice and come after us!"
"115740052-0-17062";"Enter the garden and collect the Lifeshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance."
"115740052-0-17063";"Enter the frozen alcove and collect the Flameshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance."
"115740052-0-17064";"Enter the library and collect the Mindshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance."
"115740052-0-17065";"You would think Zur would be fearless in the face of darkness. You would be wrong."
"115740052-0-17066";"Help me find <<1>>! She must've gone further!"
"115740052-0-17067";"That's the beast that webbed me! Take care, friend."
"115740052-0-17068";"I hope you know what you're doing, friend."
"115740052-0-17069";"Well done, my friend. Now enter the oubliette and set me free."
"115740052-0-17070";"<<1>>! Do you know how long I've been looking for you?"
"115740052-0-17071";"I'm sorry, sweetness … how did we get here again?"
"115740052-0-17072";"Strange … we were in a mine. But we're outside your father's house now …."
"115740052-0-17073";"Never mind that silly daydream, my dearest."
"115740052-0-17074";"You silly oaf! Oh, I can't stay mad at you, love!"
"115740052-0-17075";"Creature! I gladly take my love's place!"
"115740052-0-17076";"Hush now, sweetling. Come, and rest."
"115740052-0-17077";"You have done well to make it this far, but there is still more to do to set me free."
"115740052-0-17078";"You're in my head! Get out, get out!"
"115740052-0-17079";"There, now. Isn't that better? Don't fight, just … let go."
"115740052-0-17080";"My body is imprisoned within a pillar of darkness, generated by the ebon shards to each side."
"115740052-0-17081";"Place a Light of Meridia in both of the sconces. Each will create a beam of light that will strike a nearby crystal."
"115740052-0-17082";"By rotating the crystals, you can change a beam's direction. You may need to rotate a crystal multiple times to connect the beams and form a path of light to the ebon shards."
"115740052-0-17083";"Adjust the crystals until the beams of light destroy the ebon shards. Then the pillar of darkness will collapse and I shall be free."
"115740052-0-17084";"Hello again, Manthir. Fine day this, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-17085";"Surely you know by now. I want us to be married. I will return the coin I stole in exchange."
"115740052-0-17086";"I'm so happy you feel the same way!"
"115740052-0-17087";"Yes, yes. Let's get on with it. Make your demand, Farwen."
"115740052-0-17088";"I thought as much. So I must marry you or be gutted by the fat cat's thugs. Oh, very well …."
"115740052-0-17089";"I, Manthir, acknowledge that you Farwen rightfully stole my coin, and in exchange for its return, I agree to marry you."
"115740052-0-17090";"Cadwell, your mastery of portals does you proud!"
"115740052-0-17091";"I-I'm sorry Haidar."
"115740052-0-17092";"That strange gem over there may be important. Or valuable. Maybe you should take it."
"115740052-0-17093";"Go. I will follow your lead, and deal with the tears as we find them."
"115740052-0-17094";"I have waited a very long time for this moment. You have done well, my child."
"115740052-0-17095";"Molag Bal's Dark Anchors form a vortex that sucks Nirn into his dark realm. We must break these vile chains."
"115740052-0-17096";"My power is greater in this between place."
"115740052-0-17097";"The Dark Prince will need stronger chains than that to stop me. Come, we have things to discuss."
"115740052-0-17098";"I feel faint …."
"115740052-0-17100";"What're you doing, foreman?"
"115740052-0-17101";"Me? Uh, I'm just practicing. Nothing more!"
"115740052-0-17102";"Better not shoot any harpies. That's our job. And you don't want to take our job away, right?"
"115740052-0-17103";"What're you looking at? Get lost."
"115740052-0-17104";"<<1>> sent another poor bleeding heart, boys! Get in here!"
"115740052-0-17105";"The harpies are much bolder. We need more coin, for supplies and the like."
"115740052-0-17106";"I've heard disturbing rumors about your methods …."
"115740052-0-17107";"Something is coming through the tear!"
"115740052-0-17108";"Have you heard about the traveler stirring up trouble in town … and look who's here."
"115740052-0-17109";"Keep your opinions about our work to yourself."
"115740052-0-17110";"Father! You need to know what's going on out there!"
"115740052-0-17111";"Who is this? Someone come to help?"
"115740052-0-17112";"Enough! I have no patience for your theories!"
"115740052-0-17113";"Fine. If you want the truth, come talk to me."
"115740052-0-17116";"Ugorz! Put out that fire!"
"115740052-0-17117";"I'm beside myself. You truly believe you've won.\n\nI didn't expect our little friends there could kill Erthas, but I stand corrected. All this trouble because of one Bosmeri woman? You are Gilraen, of the Whisper Grove, are you not?"
"115740052-0-17119";"I am.\n\nAre you … Mehrunes Dagon?"
"115740052-0-17121";"It was you who rallied this peasant village to contend with me. Fascinating that a mortal could be so troublesome.\n\nI need a replacement for your Erthas. Come. Meet with me, and I will close this Gate, spare your people."
"115740052-0-17122";"Get up here, Zirani! It's time for your beatings."
"115740052-0-17123";"Trust a Daedric Prince? You must think I was born yesterday. Still …."
"115740052-0-17124";"I think … I think I have little choice. Tell the others to get as far away from here as they can."
"115740052-0-17125";"We must put aside our differences and work together or this assault is doomed from the start."
"115740052-0-17126";"How do we know this isn't a ruse? A clever plan to divert our forces while your armies take the Imperial City?"
"115740052-0-17127";"I thought backstabbing was your favorite tactic, Emeric!"
"115740052-0-17128";"Please! Are you both so arrogant? Your weapons are children's toys compared to the horrors that Molag Bal commands!"
"115740052-0-17129";"I will not wager the future of my people on the word of a snow barbarian and an adolescent female. I fear for Tamriel's future if either of you were to sit upon the Ruby Throne!"
"115740052-0-17130";"Since when do you care about your people? You never lift a finger except to count your gold!"
"115740052-0-17131";"Please, my lords! This bickering is pointless!"
"115740052-0-17132";"I need to conserve my energy for dealing with the Shackle, so I leave the hacking and slashing up to you."
"115740052-0-17133";"We need to locate the source of energy that provides the power for the Shackle."
"115740052-0-17134";"Remarkable! This could be what we were looking for."
"115740052-0-17135";"Very interesting. It appears to be similar to the cage I was imprisoned in at the Black Forge. Examine this pedestal and tell me what you make of it."
"115740052-0-17136";"The chains bind both planes. We cannot use the light until those chains are destroyed. Go quickly!"
"115740052-0-17137";"No! What have you done! Oh, wait. You reversed the energy flow. Good work! Now go upstairs and find the other conduits."
"115740052-0-17139";"We have to hurry! Molag Bal knows we're here!"
"115740052-0-17140";"Thank you. I thought I was done for!"
"115740052-0-17141";"By Akatosh's scales—your help is welcomed!"
"115740052-0-17142";"I grow weary of your games, Meridia!"
"115740052-0-17143";"Go, Warriors of Light! These dark chains must be broken!"
"115740052-0-17144";"You cannot stop me, Meridia. This realm will be mine!"
"115740052-0-17145";"We're running out of time. I'll make sure these anchors are destroyed. You have to keep moving! Place the light and disrupt this vortex."
"115740052-0-17146";"I beg of you, daughter. Try to forgive me. What I did was a foolish mistake. I never imagined anyone else would be at risk."
"115740052-0-17147";"Hello? Can you let me out of this cage, please?"
"115740052-0-17148";"I don't know what to do. I'm so angry at him … and yet … my father is all I have left."
"115740052-0-17149";"You, there! Over here! Would you be so kind as to open this cage?"
"115740052-0-17150";"What nerve, running your mouth right in front of me!"
"115740052-0-17151";"I think I can forgive you, father, though it may take time. For now, it's best if we leave this place."
"115740052-0-17152";"Oh, my dear girl. I will do everything in my power to make this up to you and to the others."
"115740052-0-17153";"Go on! Damn that hurts … I'll make sure nothing follows after you. Go!"
"115740052-0-17154";"I'm sticking with her, my friend. Gabrielle and me, we've been through a lot. I'm not going to leave her alone."
"115740052-0-17155";"Darien …."
"115740052-0-17156";"No one else dies today. That's an order. Come on, let's go set the light in place."
"115740052-0-17157";"By the Kwama Queen that hurts! No worries, I'll be all right. Should have done more stretches. Try not to do anything heroic without me. I'll only be a moment."
"115740052-0-17158";"He … he has arrived! I can't …."
"115740052-0-17159";"Keep watch while I close this."
"115740052-0-17160";"I believe that is the focal point. Place the light and let's finish this."
"115740052-0-17161";"Take your hands off me!"
"115740052-0-17162";"<<1>>! What's happening?"
"115740052-0-17163";"Bring me the heart!"
"115740052-0-17164";"Go! Get away from me! Run!"
"115740052-0-17165";"Your pitiful town won't survive without our protection."
"115740052-0-17166";"We can do without you. Go, and never return."
"115740052-0-17167";"And we'll run out anyone else who tries to bully us too!"
"115740052-0-17168";"May the sands take your accursed town!"
"115740052-0-17169";"If we see you again, we'll throw you to the harpies!"
"115740052-0-17170";"There's a ladder to the south that leads up into the city."
"115740052-0-17172";"These are the great leaders of Tamriel? Pathetic. But how convenient to have them gathered together in one place, so I can crush them like insects."
"115740052-0-17173";"I swear, I'll keep my nose so clean I could whistle through it!"
"115740052-0-17174";"Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-17175";"Stay back, Countess!"
"115740052-0-17176";"Come, father. We need to make plans to travel to the Hollow City."
"115740052-0-17177";"The insects fight back! How amusing, and yet so very sad."
"115740052-0-17178";"I keep thinking of Gamirth and what happened to him. I don't think I can forgive you, father, but I'll try not to hate you."
"115740052-0-17179";"Here it is, just as promised!"
"115740052-0-17180";"No, Nelhilda, please! What will we do? What will we do?"
"115740052-0-17181";"Listen, everyone! I am going to the Hollow City. We will be safer there. It is time for most of us to leave this cursed tavern."
"115740052-0-17182";"You can stay here, father. In your precious tavern. Think about what your success has cost you and remember all that you have lost."
"115740052-0-17183";"Maybe one day Nelhilda will find it in her heart to forgive me. I'll stay here and wait. Help anyone who happens by. And drink. There's always drink."
"115740052-0-17184";"The light approaches. It brightens the shadows. It attempts to break the darkness."
"115740052-0-17185";"But the darkness is strong. Our father, our god—he is the darkness. He shall repel the light."
"115740052-0-17186";"Our father approaches. He will consume the light. He will tear it apart. He will destroy it. He will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-17187";"Our father has spoken. He wishes us to challenge you and you alone."
"115740052-0-17188";"All of Nirn shall be mine!"
"115740052-0-17189";"Let's hope this works."
"115740052-0-17190";"All right then."
"115740052-0-17191";"What … what's going on? No!"
"115740052-0-17192";"You believe that light can destroy my Planemeld? Your Prince thinks I would allow this? She is more foolish than I thought."
"115740052-0-17193";"Oh, how sad. You were drafted into a war you could never win. My council shall destroy you. I shall enjoy watching a hero die!"
"115740052-0-17194";"I live to serve. It will be my pleasure to destroy this one, my lord."
"115740052-0-17197";"Most curious. This light powers you somehow. Meridia … where are you hiding?"
"115740052-0-17198";"Merely fetching those who would stand against you."
"115740052-0-17199";"Well done! With Molag Grunda defeated, the entirety of the Chasm is now under our control."
"115740052-0-17200";"I tire of this game. Now you shall die!"
"115740052-0-17201";"Quickly, get behind my shield!"
"115740052-0-17202";"The light is ready! Quickly, release it!"
"115740052-0-17203";"Gathwen is rounding up the troops. I asked her to keep an eye on Darien, as well. He's a terror with a sword, but sometimes I think he takes too many chances."
"115740052-0-17204";"Meet me outside. We have things to discuss and I find these Daedric halls extremely distasteful."
"115740052-0-17215";"I will harvest your soul for the Deadlands."
"115740052-0-17216";"Know that you may jump from here and rejoin your friends below. What power I still possess shall keep you safe."
"115740052-0-17217";"The harpy's matriarch … was this the reason they started attacking in the first place?"
"115740052-0-17218";"Tharn is quite correct. We have little choice in the matter."
"115740052-0-17219";"Where in blazes is everyone? This should be the right spot …."
"115740052-0-17220";"I knew we couldn't be that lucky. The Shade has blocked the way."
"115740052-0-17221";"Let's see."
"115740052-0-17222";"These pedestals look as if they're still active."
"115740052-0-17223";"Yes, I know what to do."
"115740052-0-17224";"Tu'whacca extends his hand! You need only enter the portal, and you will be transported back to the desert below."
"115740052-0-17225";"Help … me …."
"115740052-0-17226";"Bakkhara? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-17227";"Now you're in for it, you weak-willed swabs!"
"115740052-0-17228";"I warn you—the Naemon you faced before was fettered by fear … and mortality. I have no such limitations."
"115740052-0-17229";"You are throwing your life for naught. The Heart is already corrupted. There's nothing you can do about that now."
"115740052-0-17230";"Rise my pretties!"
"115740052-0-17231";"Very well. Come and witness my wrath achieved. Then you will die."
"115740052-0-17232";"Y'ffre's bones! He's turned so many … we have to stop this!"
"115740052-0-17233";"As formidable as you may be, I fear we couldn't get through here in the physical realm."
"115740052-0-17234";"A house of stone? But how did they get the stone to move?"
"115740052-0-17235";"They dug it up and broke it into pieces and brought it here. I saw the wagons."
"115740052-0-17236";"I wonder if I could climb it."
"115740052-0-17237";"No!"
"115740052-0-17238";"You're no fun!"
"115740052-0-17239";"There's your proof, Master Pellingare. It was your children responsible for this madness."
"115740052-0-17240";"Hrmf. Belike I'll just have to rely on me old shaman's tricks to put right me new crew."
"115740052-0-17241";"These creatures the Prince throws at us are nothing!"
"115740052-0-17242";"I like Nords! They fight so cheerfully!"
"115740052-0-17243";"Let these creatures see the true power of my people. Nothing can stop us now."
"115740052-0-17244";"We must be getting close and that must be making them nervous. Why else throw all these monsters at us?"
"115740052-0-17245";"We're approaching that vile portal of wrong-doing. I can feel it in my bones. It feels like … evil."
"115740052-0-17246";"No matter how many creatures the Dark One sends against us, I will make each and every one of them bleed."
"115740052-0-17247";"Ah finally, a formidable foe!"
"115740052-0-17248";"Ah, another beautiful creature has fallen under Molag Bal's spell of evil! We must set her free!"
"115740052-0-17249";"Now that is a worthy adversary! There will be no shame if we lose this battle."
"115740052-0-17250";"With that portal closed, Molag Bal's reinforcements won't be able to overwhelm us. Now let's get to the Labyrinth."
"115740052-0-17251";"Another victory! I'm going to run out of room on my scabbard! Where will I mark my kills?"
"115740052-0-17252";"This victory satisfies me greatly. Now let us go forth and find more blood to spill!"
"115740052-0-17254";"Let's show them how we fight back in Skyrim, my friends!"
"115740052-0-17255";"This one shall miss you, my beloved. But this one must not despair."
"115740052-0-17256";"This one has children … young ones that depend on me. Ahirunz shall find a way to return to them. On this pendant, so Ahirunz swears!"
"115740052-0-17257";"The way is open. Destroy Seris. Painfully. He deserves whatever horrors you decide to inflict upon him."
"115740052-0-17258";"Jode's bones! What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-17259";"I will not leave my children!"
"115740052-0-17260";"I'm sure you know where you're going, but we still have work to do in the Orchard."
"115740052-0-17261";"Come talk to me. I must explain your role in the next stage of the ritual."
"115740052-0-17262";"Come. I need to explain the next steps to you. At this point, we can't afford for anything to go wrong."
"115740052-0-17263";"My poor daughter. Why did you do this?"
"115740052-0-17264";"I'm tired of the forest realm. I want to see how the world has changed in our absence."
"115740052-0-17265";"And ye're prepared to abandon family, father? Friends? The Wilderking?"
"115740052-0-17266";"I've given enough time to each, I think. I want to see the world before I die."
"115740052-0-17267";"Ha! We'll make a necromancer of you yet."
"115740052-0-17268";"Help! Is anyone there? Help!"
"115740052-0-17269";"I'll have that open in just a moment."
"115740052-0-17270";"Yahyif! These people are alive!"
"115740052-0-17271";"By the Divines! What are civilians doing down here?"
"115740052-0-17272";"Drugged. I'm guessing kidnapped from the city."
"115740052-0-17273";"Damn it. Right, you stay here and help these people. I'll take our friends to find Pellingare."
"115740052-0-17274";"What did ye get?"
"115740052-0-17275";"Time has changed our coin's worth. I couldn't buy much with our savings."
"115740052-0-17276";"And here I'd taken to dreaming of a juicy Valenwood steak."
"115740052-0-17277";"Do not fret, my friend. I liberated some supplies they won't miss."
"115740052-0-17278";"Ha! Ye're an artist my friend, a genuine artist."
"115740052-0-17280";"The Den of Lorkhaj … it's even more beautiful and horrible than I could have imagined. Come, Hallowed."
"115740052-0-17281";"Khali? Is that you? You're alive? You're safe?"
"115740052-0-17282";"Let her go! Show yourself, you bastard! I'll burn your flesh from your bones!"
"115740052-0-17283";"Khali? Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-17284";"No! I … I had to let you go once already. I'm not ready to lose you again."
"115740052-0-17285";"How can I trust anything I've seen? The Path has shown me terrors, lies … failure."
"115740052-0-17286";"Please … don't leave me."
"115740052-0-17287";"Khali … I've missed you. You left me alone in the dark."
"115740052-0-17288";"Go away! You'll ruin everything!"
"115740052-0-17289";"Return to Davon's Watch quick as you can, comrade. Sees-All-Colors must know!"
"115740052-0-17290";"Of course I'm alive. Safe and sound …."
"115740052-0-17291";"Return to Vulkhel Guard quick as you can, comrade. Sees-All-Colors must know!"
"115740052-0-17292";"How do you feel about the Dominion questioning our village?"
"115740052-0-17293";"Sir? What's going on?"
"115740052-0-17294";"Wait—Master Pellingare! Damn it!"
"115740052-0-17295";"If it leads to them letting us stay here, or better yet making us part of the Dominion, I'm all for it."
"115740052-0-17296";"You would want to be part of the Dominion?"
"115740052-0-17297";"The Bosmer that have been so kind to let us live here are part of the Dominion. So why wouldn't we want to join them?"
"115740052-0-17298";"That's true, but what if they were to ask us to take arms against our brethren?"
"115740052-0-17299";"Our brethren? You mean to consider those who would take up arms along side our former slave masters our brethren? I would sooner call a mudcrab brother than anyone who would fight alongside a Dunmer!"
"115740052-0-17300";"I didn't think about it that way."
"115740052-0-17301";"Search for him in Reaper's March, near Fort Grimwatch. I sense his presence there."
"115740052-0-17302";"Khali … don't cry. Tharn can't hurt me now. I'm at peace. Soon I'll be with mother and father."
"115740052-0-17303";"Goodbye, my sister. You will be the Mane. You will lead the Khajiit with wisdom and strength. Know always that I love you."
"115740052-0-17304";"Tearing your soul out never fails to amuse me, Gasteau. I'll return it to you. Eventually."
"115740052-0-17305";"Bring out the prisoners!"
"115740052-0-17306";"Burn them!"
"115740052-0-17307";"I'm manipulating the Husk's powers.\n\nQuick! Use it to protect you!"
"115740052-0-17309";"Take this, you mangy fleabags!"
"115740052-0-17310";"Let the pride of Haj-Uxith spill the blood of these deceivers!"
"115740052-0-17311";"That should bring them down a notch. Now finish it!"
"115740052-0-17312";"By the Ebony Blade, I will end you."
"115740052-0-17313";"Your corpse will feed my children!"
"115740052-0-17314";"No longer shall the forces of darkness only be used for evil. We stand by you, champion!"
"115740052-0-17315";"The stone belongs to my mistress Mephala. Return it, and your death will be swift."
"115740052-0-17316";"I will offer your heart to the Silver Spider."
"115740052-0-17317";"You'll never get past us!"
"115740052-0-17318";"Are you proud of being members of the Fighters Guild? Your lot is little more than sellswords.\n\nWe'll make you powerful as followers of Mephala. Be grateful."
"115740052-0-17319";"We killed her. How unfortunate.\n\nWe'll search the roads for more."
"115740052-0-17320";"We would have remade you in Mephala's image, but you've slaughtered others of the flock.\n\nYou deserve only death."
"115740052-0-17321";"Ha! Looks like we killed another one."
"115740052-0-17322";"I don't know how mother will take this."
"115740052-0-17323";"Come on! You're a warrior! Stand and defend yourself before I slit your throat!"
"115740052-0-17324";"You're lucky regulations restrict me to a hundred paces of the city walls!"
"115740052-0-17325";"Aaah! What is that?"
"115740052-0-17326";"Adamir! Timiwe! I will kill you both."
"115740052-0-17327";"Now, just calm down. I haven't made any decisions yet."
"115740052-0-17328";"This is it. The Dominion plan to drive us out of <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-17329";"We'll handle this lot. We owe you. Use the tunnel to get back to the entrance!"
"115740052-0-17330";"The entrance is the only way out of here! Use the side tunnel!"
"115740052-0-17331";"Argonians of <<c:1>>. Rebellion cannot be tolerated in <<2>>. The Dominion's enemies must remain outside of its borders.\n\nPack up your belongings. In a few days' time, my soldiers will escort you to <<c:3>>."
"115740052-0-17332";"I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice."
"115740052-0-17333";"Where will we go? What will we do?"
"115740052-0-17334";"It's all right, everyone. We must do as <<1>> says. We will find a new home, somewhere."
"115740052-0-17335";"Captain Cinnar! I have detained the Artisan! No time to thank me, I must return to my rounds."
"115740052-0-17336";"Halt, thief!"
"115740052-0-17338";"It looks like we stay, old friend."
"115740052-0-17339";"It is done."
"115740052-0-17340";"Two-Blades! You're alive! We arrived as soon as we could."
"115740052-0-17341";"Argonians of <<c:1>>! As long as this tribe pledges itself to the Dominion, you will always have a home in <<2>>."
"115740052-0-17342";"Thanks to our friends, not all was lost today."
"115740052-0-17343";"Is <<c:1>> blind? Every one of these Sea Elves is a venomous serpent waiting to strike! We should've cleansed this place of Maormer scum the moment we arrived."
"115740052-0-17344";"I'm glad you are all so excited! Please, if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can."
"115740052-0-17345";"By Zeht's tears—what's going on here?"
"115740052-0-17346";"If it means we belong, we'll pledge. Right, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-17347";"Yes, praise the Divines! Whatever allows us to stay."
"115740052-0-17348";"You got what you wanted out of my children! You promised to return the favor! I don't care what it takes, just keep them away!"
"115740052-0-17349";"Keep us away from what?"
"115740052-0-17350";"You said this would be simple!"
"115740052-0-17351";"Come on. Let's get some answers."
"115740052-0-17352";"There he is."
"115740052-0-17354";"They're here! They are not to proceed further, Garron! Do you hear me?"
"115740052-0-17355";"You couldn't just leave it sitting here, could you, Blackheart? Paranoid bastard."
"115740052-0-17356";"A lich! Hope you're ready for a second death, you undead bastard!"
"115740052-0-17358";"The Redguard's iron will cannot be overcome with standard interrogation techniques. Physical tortures appear to be useless."
"115740052-0-17359";"I have therefore instructed the Daedra to move Sai Sahan into the Halls of Torment. The Duchess will be most pleased to have a new … guest."
"115740052-0-17360";"His flesh is strong, but perhaps her tortures of the mind will break him. I have come too far to allow this upstart swordmaster to thwart my plans. I will find the amulet, one way or another."
"115740052-0-17361";"<<1>>!"
"115740052-0-17362";"<<1>>, what have they done?"
"115740052-0-17363";"You will not break me, King of Worms!"
"115740052-0-17364";"What does it look like? They dug up my barrow!"
"115740052-0-17365";"You cannot break the will of a son of Yokuda! I spit on you!"
"115740052-0-17366";"What? Why?"
"115740052-0-17367";"Wouldn't stop asking about the roots."
"115740052-0-17368";"The roots? Why would they care about the …. Oh no."
"115740052-0-17369";"Told them they were asking for trouble, but did they listen? Went right to the Barrowbough. Idiots."
"115740052-0-17370";"Hey, friend! Listen, we have a problem."
"115740052-0-17372";"So, Sai Sahan is alive, and he has not been broken. An important piece of the puzzle, to be sure, but where is he being kept?"
"115740052-0-17374";"This is the information we've been looking for!"
"115740052-0-17376";"By the Empyrean Light, move faster! The more bones you find, the sooner we can all get out of this pit."
"115740052-0-17377";"I am a Justiciar of the Thalmor. I do not shovel, Orc."
"115740052-0-17378";"Just my luck they would pair me with a slave driver like you. Why don't you pick up a shovel and help me?"
"115740052-0-17379";"Don't slow down now! I will not suffer the humiliation of failure—not to a Canonreeve."
"115740052-0-17380";"What horror is this?"
"115740052-0-17381";"See to this one's brother. Bakkhara will destroy Canonreeve Oraneth's final altar, which sustains this realm."
"115740052-0-17382";"Oraneth will be pleased with this progress.\n\nYou Orcs know how to dig in the dirt, I'll give you that."
"115740052-0-17383";"It is done."
"115740052-0-17385";"Come on! We're almost there!"
"115740052-0-17386";"Have at thee, vile Shackle! We're going to give you a damned good thrashing!"
"115740052-0-17387";"Jolly good! And, as soon as you deal with the planar vortex, everything will be as right as rain!"
"115740052-0-17388";"We have to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-17389";"The Shackle formed a planar vortex. Kind of like an Oblivion straw that will suck Nirn right through and into Coldharbour. Quite amazing how I knew that!"
"115740052-0-17390";"What? Explain yourself, man! What planar vortex?"
"115740052-0-17391";"There we have it. We can talk here or back at the Mages Guild, at your discretion."
"115740052-0-17392";"<<1>>! We need your help. It's an emergency!"
"115740052-0-17393";"<<1>>! Who put you back together? Are you to blame for these Worm Cultists?"
"115740052-0-17394";"Not at all! Well, not exactly. I'll let my friend fill you in."
"115740052-0-17395";"Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-17396";"I'll talk to them. Make them understand. Maybe I'll get through this time."
"115740052-0-17398";"Be ready."
"115740052-0-17399";"Allene! Varaine! It's your father! I love you, and I want to talk to you!"
"115740052-0-17400";"It's all right. These people are here to help you."
"115740052-0-17401";"Thank you for coming, all of you."
"115740052-0-17402";"We have all heard the grumblings. But if this is to be our home, we must end this talk of defying the Dominion."
"115740052-0-17403";"Y'ffre can give us hatchlings, <<1>>. Peace with the Dominion is our only chance of survival."
"115740052-0-17405";"You tail-lifting fool! Do we ignore the slave pen they built around us? This Wood Elf god you follow corrupts your mind."
"115740052-0-17406";"While you whisper to trees, the Dominion measures our wrists for manacles! I cannot allow this."
"115740052-0-17407";"<<1>>, you turn our people away from the Hist. I sanction you for your heresy!"
"115740052-0-17408";"<<1>>, what are you saying?"
"115740052-0-17409";"<<1>>, no!"
"115740052-0-17410";"Hail Sithis!"
"115740052-0-17412";"Forgive me."
"115740052-0-17413";"Queenseye! You are needed at once!"
"115740052-0-17414";"His power keeps growing! It's nothing like we practiced!"
"115740052-0-17415";"Something's wrong! His body isn't like the others!"
"115740052-0-17416";"You've done it! You've freed me!"
"115740052-0-17417";"Leave me alone, you she-demons! I've done nothing wrong."
"115740052-0-17418";"Oh but you have, Tom! You've been hiding from us. The Captain knows."
"115740052-0-17419";"Me? Never! I'm here, aren't I? I'll go see the Captain. We'll straighten this out. Just let me through, kind lady. Did I mention you look positively glowing today?"
"115740052-0-17420";"You will indeed be seeing the Captain .… Seize him!"
"115740052-0-17421";"No! Leave me alone. By the King's shaft, I'll scream!"
"115740052-0-17422";"A one-way door. Looks like we can only go forward from here. I hope the others are all right."
"115740052-0-17423";"A most unexpected end. But such a magnificent hunt! My Hounds will sing of it for ages. \n\nNow, return to Haras. Tell him he may rest."
"115740052-0-17424";"You didn't think we forgot our promise, did you? Shadow Walkers, attack!"
"115740052-0-17425";"I pledge my life to the Silver Spider, and swear by the Ebony Blade to work in her shadow for as long as I live. I beg you, treacherous Mephala, who threads the Needle with the Hair of Wives, shroud me in your splendor."
"115740052-0-17426";"Let your cunning be mine, and I will serve as your hands in endless treachery.\n\nI will spin for you an everlasting web to ensnare your foes and bring others to your fold. Already we, your servants, have built for you an army to rival all before it."
"115740052-0-17427";"Lust is love, lies are truth, death is life."
"115740052-0-17428";"I'm going to see who needs help back by the portals. Cadwell is up at the Gatehouse. The two of you can deal with Molag Grunda."
"115740052-0-17429";"Look what they did to me! <<1>> has the key. She took it downstairs. Please, get that key!"
"115740052-0-17430";"Thank you. Now just give me a moment to deal with my nakedness situation."
"115740052-0-17431";"Did you think it would be that easy? My minions will tear you apart."
"115740052-0-17432";"You deal with the crystal! We'll take care of our new guests."
"115740052-0-17433";"Is someone out there? I could use a little help in here!"
"115740052-0-17434";"What's this? Who disturbs Captain Blackheart at his rest?\n\nCome a long way to die."
"115740052-0-17435";"Let me fix that complexion for you!"
"115740052-0-17437";"Ah, that was delicious! Why don't we head over to the pools and take a nice, relaxing soak?"
"115740052-0-17438";"Ah, my dear <<1>>. You've grown lovelier in my absence."
"115740052-0-17439";"No! You cannot do this! I cannot fail!"
"115740052-0-17441";"Farewell … my friend."
"115740052-0-17442";"This one can't believe you conquered such a beast.\n\nBakkhara will handle the ritual altar. Finally, the Canonreeve's folly can be undone."
"115740052-0-17446";"So you're the one who's taken our blessed stone! I should have killed you when I had the chance, you damned peasant!"
"115740052-0-17447";"When you're ready to leave this place, let me know."
"115740052-0-17448";"Pellingare!"
"115740052-0-17449";"He's dead, you bastard! Yahyif is dead!"
"115740052-0-17450";"Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you!"
"115740052-0-17451";"Two kings and a queen with barely a thimble of patience between them. Reaching a compromise will be no small task, I promise you."
"115740052-0-17452";"Sir!"
"115740052-0-17453";"Careful with that, you clumsy fool! Do hurry it up. We're missing everything!"
"115740052-0-17454";"I never weary of your charms, Lady Laurent."
"115740052-0-17455";"Vanus Galerion, as I live and breathe! Thank you so much for this opportunity. I had no idea the summit was to be held on the legendary island of Stirk!"
"115740052-0-17456";"It seemed a fitting choice. It was here that the leaders of the First Era assembled the All Flags Navy to do battle with the Sload."
"115740052-0-17457";"I can't wait to see what surprises Molag Bal's realm has in store for us!"
"115740052-0-17458";"We are waging war, not embarking on a sightseeing expedition, milady."
"115740052-0-17459";"Fear not, Vanus. I can take care of myself and my useless lump of a manservant."
"115740052-0-17460";"Stibbons! Haven't you finished tying those bags yet? You really are hopeless."
"115740052-0-17461";"Farewell, milady. We must dash. We're expected at the summit."
"115740052-0-17462";"Here's Telenger the Artificer, himself! Must it always take a crisis to pull you away from your toys, Telly?"
"115740052-0-17463";"Vanus. Your robes smell of failed experiments and your words of failed wit."
"115740052-0-17464";"Tell me, Telly, what Dwemer rubbish pit did you crawl out of this week?"
"115740052-0-17465";"You really must learn to respect your betters, old friend."
"115740052-0-17466";"Do let me know when one happens by, won't you?"
"115740052-0-17467";"I don't have the time or the energy, Telenger, so I'll bid you good day."
"115740052-0-17468";"Captain Alphaury. Has the island been secured?"
"115740052-0-17469";"Aye. All ships in the area have been diverted away from the island, and the wards are in place."
"115740052-0-17470";"And the alliance leaders?"
"115740052-0-17471";"They'll be here any moment. You three should get over there as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-17472";"We're on our way. Thank you, Captain."
"115740052-0-17473";"We must make haste."
"115740052-0-17474";"I can't imagine venturing outside the city. There are so many horrible places out there."
"115740052-0-17475";"I heard the Lightless Oubliette is the worse, Molag Bal only keeps his greatest enemies there."
"115740052-0-17476";"As long as we stay inside the walls, Molag Bal's minions shouldn't be able to drag us off to the Court of Contempt."
"115740052-0-17477";"I heard that Molag Bal is trying to pull Tamriel into Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-17478";"You just heard that? Didn't you know that's why we're here?"
"115740052-0-17479";"He must be using lots of Daedra and some sort of machine to accomplish that!"
"115740052-0-17480";"Enter my mind, Vestige, and walk with me through the shadows of past events."
"115740052-0-17481";"Fadalia, your life is spared. Leave, and never return."
"115740052-0-17482";"So the Wood Elves have a friend who's not afraid to fight? Good. Give me your best."
"115740052-0-17483";"My disciples, this stranger speaks the truth. We must go to the graveyard."
"115740052-0-17484";"I will explain more soon. But for now, call upon an arbiter. She must hear my confession as well."
"115740052-0-17485";"Leki grant me strength … I must not delay any longer!"
"115740052-0-17486";"Ahh, quite the view from up here, eh? I meant the landscape. Don't get any ideas."
"115740052-0-17487";"All right, let's find the rest of me! Try searching the Wormie camps, or knocking some skeletons around until my bits fall out."
"115740052-0-17488";"Efficient little nitwits. Could be a part of me in every skeleton here!"
"115740052-0-17489";"Soldier, I appreciate your vigilance, but the Argonians in <<c:1>> are guests. Refrain from any further displays of zeal or I'll have you scrub down the barricade. Dismissed."
"115740052-0-17490";"Follow me, Vestige, and learn of the events that precipitated our current crisis."
"115740052-0-17491";"That was my femur! Wait, no, my femur bends to the left. Carry on!"
"115740052-0-17492";"Ha, that tickles!"
"115740052-0-17493";"Look at all the dirt on my bones! I used to bathe weekly to keep myself presentable."
"115740052-0-17494";"My pelvis is filthy! What did the Wormies do, use it as a shovel?"
"115740052-0-17495";"Ah, that's the last one. Quickly, now! Drop my pieces on the ground and I'll put myself back together."
"115740052-0-17496";"Sai Sahan is where? Oh no …"
"115740052-0-17497";"<<1>>? What have you done?"
"115740052-0-17498";"What will you make us lose this time, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-17499";"You should have left, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-17500";"<<1>> will not forgive you again."
"115740052-0-17501";"Why, <<1>>? Why return?"
"115740052-0-17502";"My part in the story began when I awoke on the steps of the Abbey of the Moth Priests, with no memory of my prior life."
"115740052-0-17504";"The Moth Priests took pity upon me and brought me into their fold. I was weak and near death."
"115740052-0-17505";"The master commands your death."
"115740052-0-17506";"<<1>>! You were banished, yet you dare return?"
"115740052-0-17508";"<<1>>, listen to me! We're in danger. Necromancers are trying to kill the Barrowbough!"
"115740052-0-17509";"You warn of danger. <<1>>, who leveled nations with his girth!"
"115740052-0-17510";"It was there I first set eyes upon the Elder Scrolls and devoted my life to their study."
"115740052-0-17511";"Merciful Stendarr, hear my prayer. I've never prayed to the Divines before. Even when my wife… even when you took my wife, I accepted it as fate. But At'avar, how can I accept that?"
"115740052-0-17512";"The Scrolls allowed me to glimpse the very fabric of reality, but each profound insight dimmed my vision and eventually left me permanently blinded to the light of the world."
"115740052-0-17514";"If anyone deserves your mercy, it is At'avar. Please, Stendarr, free him from this curse. Bring me back my son."
"115740052-0-17515";"Together? Since when have you done anything that wasn't for yourself?"
"115740052-0-17516";"<<1>>, wait!"
"115740052-0-17518";"<<1>>!"
"115740052-0-17519";"The first companion, Lyris Titanborn, daughter of giants, was the mightiest warrior in the service of the Emperor."
"115740052-0-17520";"Next, Abnur Tharn, a powerful sorcerer and Grand Chancellor of the Imperial Elder Council."
"115740052-0-17521";"The Redguard swordmaster Sai Sahan, leader of the Imperial Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-17522";"The Imperial Emperor, Varen Aquilarios, who attempted to light the Dragonfires and failed."
"115740052-0-17523";"And finally, Mannimarco the traitor. The King of Worms. A powerful necromancer, and your executioner."
"115740052-0-17524";"The time has come, Champion."
"115740052-0-17525";"Stendarr protect us all."
"115740052-0-17526";"There it is. The Dragonfire brazier. Mannimarco, you're certain this will work?"
"115740052-0-17527";"It will work, my liege. The Amulet of Kings will rekindle the Dragonfires, and ensure your rightful place as Emperor. You have my word."
"115740052-0-17528";"It better work, Mannimarco, or you'll find your neck at the business end of my axe."
"115740052-0-17529";"My Lord, I wonder if you'd muzzle your half-giant pet? She really is annoying."
"115740052-0-17530";"Enough, both of you! We are here to ensure My Lord's rightful claim to the Ruby Throne."
"115740052-0-17531";"Quickly, now! Into the portal!"
"115740052-0-17532";"Abnur, begin the ritual. I have a destiny to fulfill."
"115740052-0-17533";"Hello, what's this?"
"115740052-0-17534";"Tongues of Xarxes! What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-17535";"Make it go away! Make it go away!"
"115740052-0-17536";"The companions assemble once more. Travel to the harborage; it is time for our final preparations."
"115740052-0-17537";"By the lighting of the Dragonfires, I claim my rightful lineage! By the fires of creation, let me be reborn! By the will of Akatosh, I proclaim myself … Dragonborn!"
"115740052-0-17539";"Varen Aquilarios, you are no heir to Alessia! You will pay for your sacrilege! The veil between Tamriel and Oblivion tears and splits asunder!"
"115740052-0-17540";"Unlock the tower door!"
"115740052-0-17541";"This isn't supposed to happen! What's the meaning of this? Mannimarco, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-17542";"What's happening? The sky is opening up! This is bad! This is very bad!"
"115740052-0-17543";"Thank you, living one. I will relish this vengeance and then enjoy my rest."
"115740052-0-17544";"Behold the fate of the King of Worms."
"115740052-0-17545";"Stop. Before you enter this village, a word with you."
"115740052-0-17546";"Please! No more! It was a misunderstanding, great one! Let me serve you. Let me prove my loyalty. No more, I beg of you!"
"115740052-0-17547";"Mannimarco's torment will be endless. The God of Schemes will use him to set an example. All who follow him will know, you cannot hope to betray the greatest of betrayers."
"115740052-0-17548";"I cannot help but pity him, despite all he has done."
"115740052-0-17549";"But, this is not why you were called here, Vestige. Come. Sai Sahan would speak with you first."
"115740052-0-17550";"We should not tarry from our task."
"115740052-0-17551";"Gullible fools! The veil between Oblivion and this world has been torn! My master, Molag Bal, is free to claim Tamriel for his own!"
"115740052-0-17552";"Oops! Are my vines getting in your way?"
"115740052-0-17553";"I'll open a portal to hasten your journey."
"115740052-0-17554";"Akatosh! Forgive me! Have mercy on our souls!"
"115740052-0-17555";"You've done your part. Get back to <<1>> when you can."
"115740052-0-17556";"Psst. Over here!"
"115740052-0-17557";"There you are."
"115740052-0-17558";"Oh, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-17559";"Wow. I wish <<1>> could have seen that thing."
"115740052-0-17560";"Long ago it was written—so long as the Amulet of Kings was borne by Alessia's heirs, Tamriel would be protected from the forces of Oblivion. But the Soulburst tore the veil between worlds, and gave Molag Bal the opportunity he desired."
"115740052-0-17561";"Thank you for freeing us! You can't imagine the things we've seen."
"115740052-0-17562";"Those fools! What are they doing?"
"115740052-0-17563";"The town is just down the path."
"115740052-0-17564";"Everything must follow the appropriate process, or a judgment can't be reached. We must begin again."
"115740052-0-17567";"That man can be rather … trying."
"115740052-0-17569";"What is this? The abbey burns!"
"115740052-0-17570";"I've read about such things, but the books don't do it justice."
"115740052-0-17571";"I can't stand that man."
"115740052-0-17572";"Molag Bal's Dark Anchors pierce the torn veil, and seek to draw Nirn into the depths of Coldharbour. These terrible engines of destruction have been appearing all throughout Tamriel."
"115740052-0-17573";"The worms and their master will pay for this!"
"115740052-0-17574";"Kasura!"
"115740052-0-17575";"There!"
"115740052-0-17576";"Kasura! Are you injured? What happened?"
"115740052-0-17577";"Ah, Sai Sahan and company, at last! My pet has been waiting for you."
"115740052-0-17578";"Thank you, friend! Meet us in Longhaven when we're all out of here. I'm sure Nivrilin will reward you for this!"
"115740052-0-17579";"Kill a few more of those overgrown lizards for me! I'll see you in Longhaven."
"115740052-0-17580";"You have this one's gratitude. Jone and Jode protect you."
"115740052-0-17581";"Areldur! You live!"
"115740052-0-17582";"I … perhaps you are right. Forgive an old warrior's foolish notions. This is not the time for silly dreams. You should go speak with Lyris now."
"115740052-0-17583";"I do, though I've seen better days. The High Kinlord's power has grown.\n\nHe would not have been able to escape our predecessors as he has escaped us today. We need to go after him."
"115740052-0-17584";"My lord, with your permission."
"115740052-0-17585";"You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now."
"115740052-0-17586";"All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind—not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel."
"115740052-0-17587";"Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own."
"115740052-0-17588";"That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice."
"115740052-0-17589";"I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day."
"115740052-0-17590";"Stay down, Keeper, you're injured.\n\nIf the others yet live, we should find them—then deal with Rilis, if we can. He has already escaped. I will not suffer further dishonor by losing lives to him."
"115740052-0-17591";"By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade of fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straight into the heart of a Daedric Prince."
"115740052-0-17592";"You're ever the optimist. An Altmer should not fear the end, Cirion.\n\nI would give the lives of all four of us to stop Rilis. The High Kinlord will rend Tamriel apart if he gets to the surface. And it will be our fault."
"115740052-0-17593";"Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago."
"115740052-0-17594";"It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn."
"115740052-0-17595";"Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along."
"115740052-0-17596";"There is a difference between fearing death and throwing your life away, Areldur. \n\nAnd as long as I lead the Keepers, you will do neither. If the others live, we'll find them."
"115740052-0-17597";"We stand united once more—the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!"
"115740052-0-17598";"Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go."
"115740052-0-17599";"Jahi sent you, didn't she?"
"115740052-0-17600";"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have cut the plant. Please, spare me."
"115740052-0-17601";"Honored leaders! You have seen the face of our enemy!"
"115740052-0-17602";"Molag Bal threatens every living being in Tamriel! The Mages Guild and the Fighters Guild have agreed to join forces to launch an assault on Coldharbour!"
"115740052-0-17603";"Your restlessness trapped us here in the first place!"
"115740052-0-17604";"There are a vast number of Elf bones in <<Ac:1>>. If we all use them together, we can drive out the invader!"
"115740052-0-17605";"Once more you bring danger upon us, then beg for our help to end it. No longer! You'll remain beneath the Barrowbough until the world forgets you!"
"115740052-0-17607";"How many more of your friends must die, Sai Sahan? Where is the Amulet of Kings?"
"115740052-0-17608";"Trust in us! Sanction our actions! Give us your blessings! We will not let you down!"
"115740052-0-17609";"Oh, that one is definitely mine. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-17610";"We will pour every iota of our strength into those items. Take them to the crypts beneath the ruined chapel."
"115740052-0-17611";"I am the Snake. I hide in the tall grass and close on my prey with lightning speed. I'm cunning, agile, and fierce."
"115740052-0-17612";"Vanus is right. The Guilds are our best and only choice. Send them to Coldharbour!"
"115740052-0-17613";"It is strange to return to these mountains. Memories of youth flood my mind, each one bringing its own sorrow, or its own smile."
"115740052-0-17614";"Kasura often said that rudeness is a weak man's imitation of strength. She is wise beyond her years. You will like her, Snow Lily."
"115740052-0-17615";"I hate to admit it, but I agree with Emeric."
"115740052-0-17616";"Watch. My prey does not see me coming until it's too late."
"115740052-0-17617";"As do I. It appears that much of the distrust between our alliances was sown and nurtured by the God of Schemes."
"115740052-0-17618";"I'm the Spinner. The village expects more of me, and I failed them."
"115740052-0-17619";"I didn't have a choice! It was just one plant—I would have died otherwise."
"115740052-0-17620";"Molag Bal thrives on deception and chaos, but if you'll forgive me, this Alliance War is of your own making."
"115740052-0-17621";"Let's not forget the struggles that got us to this point. We're almost home. We just have a bit further to fight."
"115740052-0-17622";"Are you all insane? You do realize what we need to do, right? We have to fight a Daedric Prince. Amulet or no, this is going to mean more death. Vestige! Come here. I'll tell you what they're afraid to mention."
"115740052-0-17623";"Arkay, forgive me. When I realized what they were doing to us, I tried to throw myself from this tower."
"115740052-0-17624";"From such desperation, I found the anger and strength to resist this torment. We must slay the flesh abomination. We can do this. Together."
"115740052-0-17625";"Countess Hakruba. Gather the surviving members of both Guilds in the <<1>>. The champion and I will go there now to open the portal."
"115740052-0-17626";"Stibbons! Thank the Radiant Mother you're all right. When I saw <<1>> with your jewels, I feared the worst!"
"115740052-0-17627";"Poor Quintus.  Always a little clumsy … in his research, in murdering people. In … relationships."
"115740052-0-17628";"It's Voranil! Areldur, see to him."
"115740052-0-17629";"By the Empyrean Light! Let's hope he lives."
"115740052-0-17630";"Ah, here come some new friends. Let's see if I've still got the touch."
"115740052-0-17631";"Slaughter. Still delightful after all these years."
"115740052-0-17632";"Deceive and strike. The way of the Snake is dark and calculated. Remember this."
"115740052-0-17633";"All right? How can you say that? They have my dear Lady Laurent's jewels! She will be quite distraught if I don't retrieve them."
"115740052-0-17634";"At least you're alive. That's something! I know a secret tunnel by the pools. I can lead you there while our friend fetches your lady's jewelry. What do you think?"
"115740052-0-17635";"Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes."
"115740052-0-17636";"So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought it over. I'll do it."
"115740052-0-17637";"Snow Lily, no! You should not need to give your life this way. This is my duty—penance for my numerous failures. This is my chance to make things right."
"115740052-0-17638";"The Scrolls said nothing of this moment, and so I am not bound to their dictates. Vestige, I ask that you let me do this one thing. All that has happened was because of my hubris. I shall be the one."
"115740052-0-17639";"We'll be right behind you, Vanus."
"115740052-0-17640";"Sire, you've done enough. This was Mannimarco's doing, not yours."
"115740052-0-17641";"As the one who will fight the Daedric Prince, the Vestige should decide."
"115740052-0-17642";"I don't see you leaping to volunteer, Tharn. Saving your own backside again?"
"115740052-0-17643";"Hard as it may be, Lyris, don't be an idiot. I am the only one who knows the ritual and we don't have time to teach anyone else."
"115740052-0-17644";"That's enough. It won't be decided here and now. Vestige, come here. I have some final words for you."
"115740052-0-17645";"Follow me. The hidden entrance will not be obvious."
"115740052-0-17646";"Has he been slain?"
"115740052-0-17647";"He's not the model of well-being, but he lives.\n\nAre you satisfied, Cirion? I'm eager to pursue the High Kinlord."
"115740052-0-17648";"Patience, Areldur. I need you to heal him. And Imiril is still unaccounted for. We'll need her to face Rilis."
"115740052-0-17649";"The energy source is aligned—I think it's animating! Kill for your masters, Stormfist!"
"115740052-0-17650";"A valiant effort, but the invasion will proceed as planned. My storm will behead Malabal Tor, and the Maormer army will feast on its remains."
"115740052-0-17651";"The storms are powerful, now! You'll die before I let you touch the Conduit Stone!"
"115740052-0-17652";"It's too late to stop the storm, now. Your death will be the first of many."
"115740052-0-17653";"Here, let me take care of them for you."
"115740052-0-17654";"I am the Tiger. I use brute force to destroy my prey. I am strong, proud, and fearless."
"115740052-0-17655";"I stand toe-to-toe with my prey and deliver a ferocious killing blow!"
"115740052-0-17656";"Use superior strength to overcome your prey. The way of the Tiger is to dominate. Remember this."
"115740052-0-17657";"Look. Such power I have now. Almost like the old days."
"115740052-0-17658";"You should have listened to me …."
"115740052-0-17659";"Now your nightmare begins!"
"115740052-0-17660";"Your blood tastes of the Father …."
"115740052-0-17661";"It's time for a new era to begin in Tamriel. An age of calamity and suffering."
"115740052-0-17662";"We'll use your blood to paint the walls!"
"115740052-0-17663";"That was an excellent example of a daring display gone wrong. I will cherish your skull on my mantle. Now to burn Tamriel above!"
"115740052-0-17664";"Your bones will finish this altar. An altar for my Oraneth."
"115740052-0-17665";"Your bodies will feed the darkness. And the darkness will win this war for the Altmer."
"115740052-0-17666";"I run Darkshade now!"
"115740052-0-17667";"I offer these lives in honor of the Forest Mother."
"115740052-0-17668";"This is what happens to those who defile the forest. Your bodies will feed the dirt."
"115740052-0-17669";"You are neither the first or the last to fall. Our shadow will blanket this land."
"115740052-0-17670";"Your death was always part of the Spinner's plan."
"115740052-0-17671";"You've defiled the Obsidian Husk. Mephala will not be pleased."
"115740052-0-17672";"Your bodyguards are dead, Tharayya! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-17673";"I am the Wolf. I howl and the rest of the pack responds. Sharp-toothed and hungry, we hunt together."
"115740052-0-17674";"Working together, we take down the toughest foe."
"115740052-0-17675";"Hunt as a pack. The way of the Wolf is to move in numbers. Remember this."
"115740052-0-17676";"These Daedra tried to keep me from my dear Lady Laurent. It's time to make them pay!"
"115740052-0-17677";"I held back fiends and vampires here, to buy time for our people to escape. Fear and anger made me strong. We will finish this. We must!"
"115740052-0-17678";"I will send every last drop of anger, hope, and desire I possess through that staff. That will draw out the abomination. I will not fail you. I will not fail Crestshade."
"115740052-0-17679";"Divines protect us! It's the monster!"
"115740052-0-17680";"Over there, Voranil! We've found her."
"115740052-0-17681";"I see her. Let's hope she lives. We'll need her before the day is done."
"115740052-0-17682";"No more! Mura will not stand for it! You won't hurt any more of Mura's friends!"
"115740052-0-17683";"Hold! This has gone on long enough!"
"115740052-0-17684";"She's going to be fine, with a little restoration magic. We should be considering how to handle the High Kinlord."
"115740052-0-17685";"Even if we defeat him, how do we contain him? He's already escaped once.\n\nIf we could control Daedric magic perhaps this wouldn't have happened. What do you think, Cirion? Fight fire with fire?"
"115740052-0-17686";"Stay your tongue, Voranil. You insult your lineage by even thinking it. Does the High Kinlord's fate appeal to you so?\n\nWe go with my plan and divide his essence among us. He can't escape his prison if he's not whole."
"115740052-0-17687";"On your feet, Keeper."
"115740052-0-17688";"Imiril? My fellow Keepers? You are free? Did I succeed?"
"115740052-0-17689";"Thanks to you, the Keepers' Oath is fulfilled."
"115740052-0-17690";"We are free from Daedric corruption. We should have heeded your warnings."
"115740052-0-17691";"I remember ….\n\nWhere is Rilis?"
"115740052-0-17692";"Banished from this realm. With hope, all the way to Oblivion."
"115740052-0-17693";"Your sacrifice ensures he will never return."
"115740052-0-17694";"You think you've beaten me? How amusing!\n\nHaven't you noticed that the pact I've made protects me from death?"
"115740052-0-17695";"What happens now?"
"115740052-0-17696";"We can lay our burdens down.  Say your goodbyes to those who aided us. You'll be leaving them, soon."
"115740052-0-17697";"Thank you, my friends. For everything."
"115740052-0-17698";"Ignore his words, Keepers. Begin the separation."
"115740052-0-17699";"I'm not confident this will work, Cirion!"
"115740052-0-17700";"Ha ha ha! What are you lot doing? Oh, I do so love to see magic. Is that what this is? This isn't as grand as the spells I learn from the Daedra, but I don't expect much from mortal Altmer."
"115740052-0-17701";"Remember, children—you'll never keep me here of your own accord. Not when the Daedra fight for me.\n\nPerhaps you'd fare better if you had Daedra on your side! Ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-17702";"His madness nears delirium. Ignore him, Keepers. Bind the High Kinlord!"
"115740052-0-17703";"By the Light Empyrean, the Keepers of the Banished Cells hereby condemn Rilis XII to imprisonment unending."
"115740052-0-17704";"Oh, my. It looks like you've won. Old Rilis' days of freedom are over, it seems."
"115740052-0-17705";"Together, my friends … focus your energy …."
"115740052-0-17706";"It's working! I can feel that … thing. It's coming! Get ready!"
"115740052-0-17707";"It's a shame you lack the power to stop me more permanently. Perhaps the Daedra could help you with that. I hear Daedric Pacts can be lucrative!"
"115740052-0-17708";"Praise the Eight and all their glory! You did it!"
"115740052-0-17709";"Meet me at the other end of the graveyard, near the southern wall. I shall look for you there."
"115740052-0-17710";"I think we are done here and I'm eager to see what waits beyond this mortal life. Farewell. Your kindness will be remembered."
"115740052-0-17711";"I can leave this world knowing I did my best. May Tu'Whacca guard you for your kindness to us."
"115740052-0-17713";"You should not have lit the flame! The mistress will delight in a new slave."
"115740052-0-17714";"This doorway's been sealed. There must be another way to the summit."
"115740052-0-17715";"We did well, stranger. I am thankful that the threat posed by that creature ended here."
"115740052-0-17716";"I knew this day would come."
"115740052-0-17717";"Of what do you speak, O priest?"
"115740052-0-17718";"The sea vomits forth its dead. The gods are punishing us for our refusal of shelter to the Kothringi."
"115740052-0-17719";"You mean the plague-infected folk whose Crimson Ship we turned away?"
"115740052-0-17720";"Yes. We left them in the grip of the Knahaten Flu. And why? Because we feared."
"115740052-0-17721";"But to give them shelter would have put our whole city at risk."
"115740052-0-17722";"The gods tested our courage, and we failed. Mark my words, this plague of undead is our atonement."
"115740052-0-17725";"No! Not —"
"115740052-0-17726";"We saved some of the townsfolk and the abomination was destroyed."
"115740052-0-17727";"I am at peace with what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you."
"115740052-0-17728";"Easy to say … far harder to do."
"115740052-0-17729";"They think they have an advantage, do they? Ha! Just wait until their plan crumbles around them!"
"115740052-0-17730";"I grieve for those we lost, but I'm happy we were able to foil Reezal-Jul's plan."
"115740052-0-17731";"Where is the Amulet of Kings?"
"115740052-0-17732";"Pick up those feet, maggots! Move! Move! Move!"
"115740052-0-17733";"Seems my secret is a secret no more."
"115740052-0-17734";"Father? Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-17735";"Wasn't expecting to run into a beetle. It must have followed my scent."
"115740052-0-17736";"You poisoned the johads? But why?"
"115740052-0-17737";"Father! Your wound …."
"115740052-0-17738";"My last wish was for the johads to remain within the family, but … it caused nothing but strife."
"115740052-0-17739";"No, you can't die! Not now!"
"115740052-0-17740";"Listen! I wish for your happiness. Promise me … the johads …."
"115740052-0-17741";"We will find happiness, Father! I swear to you."
"115740052-0-17742";"It's frosty as the edge of Skyrim up here!"
"115740052-0-17743";"Speak to me, friend. Don't be afraid."
"115740052-0-17744";"No Direnni shall get past these gates! Do you understand me?"
"115740052-0-17745";"Quickly! We must find Kasura!"
"115740052-0-17746";"According to my notes, I need a relic called the Torch of Heirs to light the Flame, located in the Hall of the Dead.\n\nMy map shows the Hall down this side passage, it seems."
"115740052-0-17747";"Did you hear that? That Khajiit doomed her own village—she's the reason it is here! Must have made a pact with the Daedra! How awkward. In future dealings with the Khajiit, try not to think about her. Think of helpful Mezha-dro! Or someone better."
"115740052-0-17748";"I know this! The day the Elden Accord was signed! The Mane was a good leader, Hallowed. A warrior."
"115740052-0-17749";"Make sure these orders circulate among the troops. They need to be prepared for what's to come."
"115740052-0-17750";"That Orc must have made a deal with that Dremora Lord. He betrayed his village, doomed it to reside in Coldharbour! Stupid Orcs and their stupid fights over ugly rock huts. Not that this one has anything against Orcs. Just stupid Orcs."
"115740052-0-17751";"Follow me, quickly! Before any more of them return!"
"115740052-0-17752";"So that elf is a traitor! He's turned on his own people for profit! Must have something to do with the Dunmer village getting pulled into Oblivion. This one is glad to see even elves can make poor life decisions."
"115740052-0-17753";"High King Emeric of the Daggerfall Covenant."
"115740052-0-17754";"Queen Ayrenn of the Aldmeri Dominion."
"115740052-0-17755";"Jorunn Skald-King of the Ebonheart Pact."
"115740052-0-17756";"Here, friend. Brackenleaf has sent me to give you the next part of your trial."
"115740052-0-17757";"Who disturbs the Heart of the Barrowbough?"
"115740052-0-17758";"<<1>>, enough with the theatrics. You need to let us in!"
"115740052-0-17759";"<<1>>? What are you doing here? Who is with you?"
"115740052-0-17760";"The day Rid-Thar-ri'Datta became the first Mane. He had to crack some skulls, mark my words. But my people are better for it today."
"115740052-0-17761";"Damned priests. Treating us like that. Even Shazah couldn't stomach it. But look at us. You and me, today. Shazah … I wish you were here."
"115740052-0-17762";"Look up there! The top of the central pillar."
"115740052-0-17763";"And now for the summit. There are many reasons not to go.\n\nI can hear blasting winds at the top of that ladder, and there is a chill that strikes the bone. Any manner of beast could be waiting for me. But I will not shame my family by walking away."
"115740052-0-17766";"Can anyone hear me? What's happening?\n\nMy blood boils, yet I feel no pain! Somebody, help me!"
"115740052-0-17768";"No! Stay away!"
"115740052-0-17769";"Vestige! Meet me at the Harborage. We are ready to rescue Sai Sahan."
"115740052-0-17770";"The bone scepter? No! Please, don't wake him!"
"115740052-0-17771";"Go with Abnur! Save Sai Sahan from the Halls of Torment!"
"115740052-0-17772";"Go with Lyris! Save Sai Sahan from the Halls of Torment!"
"115740052-0-17773";"Oh, joy. We've been here less than five minutes and Sahan is already getting maudlin and weepy."
"115740052-0-17774";"Shut up, Tharn! Don't let him get to you, Sai. Let him roll his eyes. Maybe he'll find a brain back there."
"115740052-0-17775";"So much destruction! What could have done this?"
"115740052-0-17776";"I'm afraid I've seen this before. Keep an eye skyward, Titanborn!"
"115740052-0-17777";"I demand you release the prisoner immediately! Your detention of a Maormer citizen is in direct violation of the treaty we long ago signed with <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-17778";"Do you mean the spy we caught skulking around our wrecked ships? He stays put."
"115740052-0-17779";"Where's my son? Help me! Please! I need to find my son!"
"115740052-0-17780";"Then I'll raise this matter with Headwoman <<1>> in <<2>>. She should know the Dominion for what they really are—High Elf arrogance, at the point of a sword."
"115740052-0-17781";"I'm so frightened. I don't know what to do."
"115740052-0-17782";"Your life is a lie, Sai Sahan. You failed to become a sword-singer. You failed in your sworn duty to protect your Emperor. To this day your former companions mock you for your incompetence and call you a fool!"
"115740052-0-17783";"Becoming a sword-singer is child's play, Sai. I mastered it in an afternoon. Here, let me show you."
"115740052-0-17784";"No! You are not real! I have heard your lies and borne your torment, day after day, year after year! You will not break me!"
"115740052-0-17785";"So much yelling. So much screaming. I need to stay strong. Stay strong."
"115740052-0-17786";"Be on your guard."
"115740052-0-17788";"Guard! Why won't you help? We need help!"
"115740052-0-17789";"Esteemed High King Emeric, I thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I would not presume to waste your time without good reason."
"115740052-0-17790";"Cat's Eye ""Key."" Would you listen to these bumpkins? Who says ""Key?"""
"115740052-0-17791";"We've known each other for some time, Master Galerion. You aren't known for your capricious whims. Tell me though—who is your companion?"
"115740052-0-17792";"Your Majesty, this is Queen Ayrenn's personal representative, here to speak with you about the impending Coldharbour crisis."
"115740052-0-17793";"Exactly. Call it Cat's Eye ""Kway,"" like the Divines intended."
"115740052-0-17794";"What are you on about? It's Cat's Eye ""Kay."" What imbecile says ""Kway?"""
"115740052-0-17795";"My mother. The harbormaster."
"115740052-0-17796";"Bumpkin."
"115740052-0-17797";"Your Majesty, this is Skald-King Jorunn's personal representative, here to speak with you about the impending Coldharbour crisis."
"115740052-0-17798";"So Queen Ayrenn sends her personal champion into the stronghold of her greatest enemy? Either she has a lot of faith in you, or she's trying to get you killed. Hm. I'm intrigued. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-17799";"The Skald-King sends his personal champion into his enemy's stronghold? Either he has a lot of faith in you, or he's trying to get you killed. Hmm. I'm intrigued. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-17800";"I have a good feeling about these tunnels. Perhaps we'll actually find Pellingare tonight."
"115740052-0-17801";"Eyes skyward! Here it comes!"
"115740052-0-17802";"That was your opinion last night, too."
"115740052-0-17803";"Yes. And one day some Divine will reward me for my unwavering optimism."
"115740052-0-17804";"Come, you wretched souls. Feed me!"
"115740052-0-17805";"Oblivion take you!"
"115740052-0-17806";"And when you get there, tell all your friends who sent you back!"
"115740052-0-17807";"Tell Cariel that I hope to drop in for a visit very soon. From an upper story. She'll know what I mean."
"115740052-0-17808";"The day is ours, my friends, but Kasura and her people have a long task ahead of them if they are to rebuild the abbey."
"115740052-0-17809";"They're already inside. If we're lucky, they haven't made it to the heart of the Barrowbough."
"115740052-0-17810";"So you've been mingling with the enemy, have you, Dariah? Just so you know—I already knew that."
"115740052-0-17811";"Oh, I love to mingle, Your Majesty. I'm going to mingle their heads right off their necks one of these days."
"115740052-0-17812";"Why would a crypt need a secret entrance?"
"115740052-0-17813";"It's a wonder there's an unplundered crypt in all of Skyrim! You Nords could learn a thing or two from the builders of Hammerfell."
"115740052-0-17814";"Perhaps Hammerfell could also teach Nibenay the virtue of good manners."
"115740052-0-17815";"And why are there intruders in the roots of the Barrowbough? <<1>>, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-17816";"What do you mean, ""no chance of hurricanes?"""
"115740052-0-17817";"It says they're unseasonable to <<1>> this time of year."
"115740052-0-17818";"Then what would you call the hurricane that smashed <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-17819";"Unseasonable, I suppose."
"115740052-0-17820";"The flame of my heart now resides within you."
"115740052-0-17821";"Carry it with honor, and protect my forest with pride. I will now return you to <<1>>."
"115740052-0-17822";"Hunt well, and tend my forest with care."
"115740052-0-17823";"This is the worst vacation."
"115740052-0-17824";"What  do you mean?"
"115740052-0-17825";"Not a day here before the hurricane hits. Then a Dominion fleet smashes ashore, which means our leave is well and truly canceled."
"115740052-0-17826";"Could've been worse. You could've introduced me to your mother."
"115740052-0-17827";"When you put it like that …."
"115740052-0-17828";"We're gone three hours and the Maormer attack the city? Typical! Always missing the real fight."
"115740052-0-17829";"You have to admit, the temple was interesting."
"115740052-0-17830";"Stone, water, and talkative ghosts. What about that is interesting?"
"115740052-0-17831";"Every part?"
"115740052-0-17832";"You're hopeless."
"115740052-0-17833";"Where is the Amulet of Kings? Tell me, or I'll gut you like a fish with your own sword!"
"115740052-0-17834";"Newest of the Briars, you have my blessing. Good luck, and return to my forest any time."
"115740052-0-17835";"Now, let's see about this curse."
"115740052-0-17836";"Done! Good as new."
"115740052-0-17837";"My sweet Musi! You did it! Good girl!"
"115740052-0-17838";"Such a stubborn Elf! Perhaps your companion will be more willing to listen to reason."
"115740052-0-17839";"They've broken through!"
"115740052-0-17840";"What a waste of time!"
"115740052-0-17841";"Obstinate fools, both of you!"
"115740052-0-17842";"The hour has arrived, Vestige. The final confrontation with the God of Schemes is at hand. The Five Companions gather at the Harborage. Meet us there."
"115740052-0-17843";"What a mess. Apologies, Vanus, but I'm going to check on my Lion Guard."
"115740052-0-17844";"I can still hear my heart beating. Am I alive? What should I do?"
"115740052-0-17845";"Where is everyone? I can hear wails and screams, but I can't see anyone! I need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-17846";"Watch yourselves, outsiders. Give us a good reason, and the Armigers will cut you down where you stand!"
"115740052-0-17847";"We'll burn you …."
"115740052-0-17848";"Freeze you …."
"115740052-0-17849";"What was that? Something touched me! Mauloch, help me! I think I'm going insane!"
"115740052-0-17850";"And shatter you."
"115740052-0-17851";"Any questions? I didn't think so."
"115740052-0-17852";"Honored Skald-King, I am here with the personal champion of Queen Ayrenn …."
"115740052-0-17853";"Honored Skald-King, I am here with the personal champion of High King Emeric …."
"115740052-0-17854";"You dare to bring a Dominion lapdog here?"
"115740052-0-17855";"You dare to bring a Covenant lapdog here?"
"115740052-0-17856";"Silence, Thrush! Master Galerion, please continue."
"115740052-0-17857";"Dearest? Brena? Can you hear me? I think something happened. Are you all right, my dearest?"
"115740052-0-17858";"Just rest easy, my love. I'm sure you will be fine. I feel so strange. So … confused. But don't worry, my dearest. Everything will be fine."
"115740052-0-17859";"My companion hopes to speak with you about the impending Coldharbour crisis."
"115740052-0-17860";"I have heard tales of this one. The Skald-King favors the bold, even among his enemies! Come, champion. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-17861";"Thanks again, my friend. Stendarr defend you."
"115740052-0-17862";"We rise to fight beside you!"
"115740052-0-17863";"Help us protect the roots!"
"115740052-0-17864";"Invaders! Cut them down!"
"115740052-0-17865";"We rise again. But for how long?"
"115740052-0-17866";"Hurry, to the gate!"
"115740052-0-17867";"Here we are. Watch your step as you descend."
"115740052-0-17868";"Enemies at the inner gate! Come quickly, we'll drive out the Worm Cult!"
"115740052-0-17869";"How dare you intrude within my …. What? It's you!"
"115740052-0-17870";"What's happened here? Where is Gilraen?\n\nSpread out and search for her."
"115740052-0-17871";"Now, a toast! To finding my true form at last!"
"115740052-0-17872";"No! The tail is right, but why so many scales? My family will never accept me like this."
"115740052-0-17873";"We've waited here long enough. They're not coming. Montclair's men probably killed them."
"115740052-0-17874";"I know … I just do not understand how this happened. I always thought the baron was a good man."
"115740052-0-17875";"I don't know. I heard rumors he's associated with vampires. Who cares though, we leave tomorrow and put it all behind us."
"115740052-0-17876";"Tread lightly. Few living have been permitted to walk among these honored dead."
"115740052-0-17877";"Divad Hunding, son of Frandar do Hunding Hel Ansei No Shira, the greatest of the Sword Saints. The hearth of every household in Hammerfell has small alcove containing a copy of his father's greatest work, The Book of Circles."
"115740052-0-17878";"Ra Abah was a warrior of great renown. He fought alongide Frandar Hunding in the seven great battles against the Armies of Hira, and survived. At the final battle at Hattu Mountain, more than three hundred thousand gave their lives."
"115740052-0-17879";"Ansei Kalam, master of polearms, and his daughter Ra Adia. They swept through these mountain passes like a tempest, driving out the bandit tribes that had harrassed our people for two decades."
"115740052-0-17880";"The twins of sword and spear, Ra Hasa and Ra Huzar, and their mother, Ansei Satameh the Tigress of Dragonstar."
"115740052-0-17881";"It seems fitting that the Ring of Stendarr's Mercy lies with my father's greatsword. We will need both for the battles that lay before us."
"115740052-0-17882";"It's just you and me now."
"115740052-0-17883";"I had hoped otherwise, but I suppose it was always going to end this way. For all of us."
"115740052-0-17884";"If only you had realized that before you let your undead children bury half the city down here. If your vanity had allowed you to alert the guards this—\n\nI don't suppose that matters very much to you. Let's get on with this."
"115740052-0-17885";"Tell the lovely Copper Dariah that this one looks forward to seeing her lithe figure in her tight leathers."
"115740052-0-17886";"Tell the lovely Dunmer, Naryu, that she is very welcome to disguise herself as a serving girl and show off for this one."
"115740052-0-17887";"Raz! Inappropriate."
"115740052-0-17888";"This one has no regrets."
"115740052-0-17889";"That's old Dethin Halde's skull. As fine a man as ever lived, but he's no scholar."
"115740052-0-17890";"Nothing! I'm trying to help!"
"115740052-0-17891";"Once again you bring us suffering. Banishment is too good for you, this time."
"115740052-0-17892";"How touching! Your friends are here to save you. Pity they arrived too late. It's time for your next round of torture. You'll enjoy this one."
"115740052-0-17893";"And darkness falls. This only gets better as we go along."
"115740052-0-17894";"begins to shake."
"115740052-0-17895";"Sai, my love. Where is the Amulet? If you tell me, this will all be over and we can finally be together."
"115740052-0-17896";"That sounded like my voice! What's going on? I never said that!"
"115740052-0-17898";"Arkay, lord of the seasons, please forgive my children their trespasses, and forgive me mine for refusing to allow their departure from this world."
"115740052-0-17899";"It's done. Too late, but it's done."
"115740052-0-17900";"Intruders! They're after the amulet! Don't worry, my love. My sisters will deal with these pests."
"115740052-0-17901";"I knew I'd find them here! Interesting. I've never been to this area before but it's … breathtaking!"
"115740052-0-17902";"All right, the Countess has given us our orders! Let's head west and see if there's any truth to those disturbing rumors!"
"115740052-0-17903";"I'll deal with them. You'll be safe here, my love."
"115740052-0-17904";"Greatly Esteemed Queen Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri, it is my great honor to present to you …."
"115740052-0-17905";"Vanus, you're so formal! I remember the patience and kindness you showed an awkward, freckled waif all those years ago on fair Summerset! You captured this child's heart then, and it remains with you to this day."
"115740052-0-17906";"You warm an old man's heart, my Queen. I remember well those halcyon days."
"115740052-0-17907";"As do I, my old friend. Sorry about all these guards. I'm told they're necessary. These are dark days."
"115740052-0-17908";"A wise precaution, my Queen. My counsel would be no different. If you'll permit it, my companion would like to speak with you."
"115740052-0-17909";"Ah yes. Let me meet this hero I've heard so much about. It's not often the heroic deeds of one who, by all rights, should be considered a mortal enemy, reach my ears. Come, let's talk."
"115740052-0-17910";"Be thankful my hand was stayed. You deserve to die down here next to your children. Yahyif and I risked our lives to come down here to save your noble hide."
"115740052-0-17911";"Too late, once again. Come, my pet. Time for your next session!"
"115740052-0-17912";"That's the last of them! We have all the pieces. We should go to the Constellation Room and put <<1>> back to sleep!"
"115740052-0-17913";"I'm not giving you a choice. Now move."
"115740052-0-17914";"Please, just end this. I don't want to live."
"115740052-0-17915";"You dare interrupt me? <<1>>, my son … see to this intruder!"
"115740052-0-17916";"Give my best to Thrush. Tell him I hope we can dance again, soon."
"115740052-0-17917";"I thought you said this bastard wouldn't be able to speak."
"115740052-0-17918";"He shouldn't be able to achieve coherent thought. We'll have to watch him carefully."
"115740052-0-17919";"No! It hurts, it hurts!"
"115740052-0-17920";"Where is the Amulet of Kings? This can all be over if you just tell me. You can finally rest. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Sai?"
"115740052-0-17921";"Have I been here two years, or two thousand years? I can no longer tell. But I will never break! Never!"
"115740052-0-17922";"This one will meet you at the barn. Try not to get killed along the way."
"115740052-0-17923";"Sai is in pain. Release his bonds, quickly!"
"115740052-0-17925";"Protect the leaders! Defeat Molag Bal's minions and close the unstable rifts!"
"115740052-0-17926";"Peace at last."
"115740052-0-17927";"The weapon is ready, comrade. Take it from the anvil, and follow us into battle!"
"115740052-0-17928";"Ah-hah! That's it. It's in the well water."
"115740052-0-17929";"You have done it, Vestige! Bring him through the portal, quickly!"
"115740052-0-17930";"I won't let you kill him, Andur!"
"115740052-0-17934";"1"
"115740052-0-17935";"2"
"115740052-0-17936";"3"
"115740052-0-17937";"4"
"115740052-0-17938";"5"
"115740052-0-17939";"Calm down, shaveskin. Your courage is commendable, but highly misplaced. We are here to help."
"115740052-0-17940";"Leave this place! I won't let you wake him!"
"115740052-0-17941";"Stay back, vampire! I'll stick you with this sword. I mean it!"
"115740052-0-17943";"Stop acting like a coward, Dathieu! I am your king and I will lead you to victory today."
"115740052-0-17944";"Your Majesty, you've clearly lost your mind. I'm sorry, but you leave me no choice."
"115740052-0-17945";"It is done. No further lives need be thrown away today."
"115740052-0-17946";"Traitor! But your feeble betrayal won't stop Reezal-Jul's magic! We shall live forever, but not you. I curse you and will scatter your bones! Die, you treacherous dog!"
"115740052-0-17947";"You killed Sees-All-Colors."
"115740052-0-17948";"You saved Sees-All-Colors."
"115740052-0-17949";"I'll never get used to this place. Come here, Vestige. I'd like a word before we skip off merrily to our doom."
"115740052-0-17950";"Molag Bal will undoubtedly set his most powerful servants in our path. Prepare for the worst."
"115740052-0-17951";"This place is alive with pain and suffering. This must be where Molag Bal torments those who displease him."
"115740052-0-17952";"Look there! Is that Mannimarco?"
"115740052-0-17953";"Mannimarco! He was a back-stabbing hypocrite with delusions of godhood. The fool got precisely what he deserved!"
"115740052-0-17954";"Are you insane? That worm didn't deserve your mercy!"
"115740052-0-17955";"Ha! Sorry, trolls—no dessert today!"
"115740052-0-17956";"Thanks barrels! Meet me on the Evermore Docks and I'll have your reward!"
"115740052-0-17957";"You actually released me? Naive fool! Future generations will pay for your weakness!"
"115740052-0-17958";"Molag Bal is here. I can feel his presence. Sense his foul breath upon the wind."
"115740052-0-17959";"Cowards, the lot of you! This mine belongs to House Selos. You are intruders, and will be disciplined as such!"
"115740052-0-17960";"Go away! Leave us alone! I don't want to become a bloodfiend!"
"115740052-0-17961";"Gabrielle, focus all your energy into this! We can't let up!"
"115740052-0-17962";"I'm … doing … my … best!"
"115740052-0-17963";"These are some ugly bastards! Is this the best Molag Bal can throw at us? I'm hardly working up a sweat!"
"115740052-0-17964";"This may well be our last battle. Let's make them remember it!"
"115740052-0-17965";"You must hurry! My shield can't withstand much more of this!"
"115740052-0-17966";"Almost … there!"
"115740052-0-17967";"I can feel it, Vanus! We can beat this! We can—Darien, behind you!"
"115740052-0-17968";"Have no fear, beautiful Gabrielle! I have this under control!"
"115740052-0-17969";"You have to hurry! We can't hold them back much longer."
"115740052-0-17970";"Darien! Get back here! Darien!"
"115740052-0-17971";"Help! Don't let him take me!"
"115740052-0-17972";"That's the wrong way! There might be more of those things that way! I'm going back to my house."
"115740052-0-17973";"No! What are you … what …."
"115740052-0-17974";"Rejoice! Soon we will have a new member of our family - Draven!"
"115740052-0-17975";"Patience, friends. I will speak to each of you individually."
"115740052-0-17976";"I don't recognize you. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-17977";"That carcass is mine! You won't leave here alive!"
"115740052-0-17978";"All right, let me see what components I have left. I should be able to cobble something together to slow a giant monster down …."
"115740052-0-17979";"What about that exploding squirrel you built when we were children? Or do you think that'd be too much?"
"115740052-0-17980";"Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time, forgive me for my hubris. Grant your divine power to the Vestige and restore your protection to Tamriel, that my sacrifice might not be in vain."
"115740052-0-17981";"Death is simply life's next great adventure, and I am prepared to make the journey. I hope to see you all again one day, in Sovngarde. Until then, it has been my greatest honor."
"115740052-0-17982";"I am honored to make this sacrifice. When you think of me, I hope you remember me fondly, and sing songs of this day while you toast to my memory."
"115740052-0-17983";"History may not remember your sacrifice, but those present here will never forget it."
"115740052-0-17984";"Divines of Tamriel! With this vessel of your power, the Amulet of Kings, I call upon your strength!"
"115740052-0-17985";"Let this noble sacrifice be a testament to our desire to set things right and restore balance to the Mundus!"
"115740052-0-17986";"Your champion stands ready! Accept this offering and imbue this vestige with your glory! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!"
"115740052-0-17987";"You there, wet one. This one needs to speak to you."
"115740052-0-17988";"You won't believe who escaped from the Lightless Oubliette!"
"115740052-0-17989";"Someone actually got out of that place? Who was it?"
"115740052-0-17990";"Dynar, the last Ayleid King. I saw him ordering around the Fighters Guild."
"115740052-0-17991";"New trinkets, but the box has not been opened. The time for gifts has not yet come."
"115740052-0-17992";"Molag Bal tried to pull Nirn into Coldharbour, but thankfully his plans were foiled."
"115740052-0-17993";"The Great Shackle? Whoever it was, they must have been exceedingly brave to defy Molag Bal of his greatest invention."
"115740052-0-17994";"I heard someone destroyed the Great Shackle."
"115740052-0-17995";"That was fun, but the main assault needs me now. Don't get yourself killed while I'm gone."
"115740052-0-17996";"We have spilled much blood, but now your army calls for my aid. Perhaps we shall see each other again if the Great Egg wills it."
"115740052-0-17997";"Alas, fine friend, the Fighters Guild has need of me. Do stay out of trouble while I'm gone."
"115740052-0-17999";"When the truth is silenced, it is the people who are shackled."
"115740052-0-18000";"Sind!"
"115740052-0-18001";"Tand! You're alive!"
"115740052-0-18002";"I thought I'd never see you again."
"115740052-0-18003";"What? How did you get down here?"
"115740052-0-18004";"Come here."
"115740052-0-18005";"Please, no lecture! This one is sorry."
"115740052-0-18006";"You deserve one. We were worried about you!"
"115740052-0-18007";"Tand knows."
"115740052-0-18008";"Life is a story, yes? We must live through it together. You cannot skip to the last page, win a life in a gambling den."
"115740052-0-18009";"Tand knows, he just … wanted to make you and Muzag proud."
"115740052-0-18010";"We are proud of you! Your father, your sister, me. You do not need a lot of coin to make us proud."
"115740052-0-18011";"Tand knows!"
"115740052-0-18012";"We're here for you. You know that. We'll get through this. This is nothing like the time with those Colovians, yeah? The time you almost lost your eye?"
"115740052-0-18013";"Heh, that was a bad one. This one loves you, Sind."
"115740052-0-18014";"I love you too, Tand."
"115740052-0-18015";"<<1>>, a moment? This recruit survived the shipwreck without injuries. You mentioned something about <<Ac:2>>, yes?"
"115740052-0-18016";"Very good, <<1>>. I'll take it from here."
"115740052-0-18017";"<<1>> is this way."
"115740052-0-18018";"<<1>>, this recruit wishes to speak with you."
"115740052-0-18019";"We should speak privately. Before you depart, let's meet by the statues north of camp."
"115740052-0-18020";"Would you look at it go! Hmm? Yes, wonderful, put them on the workbench."
"115740052-0-18021";"Who dares to defy the Dutchess of Anguish? I will tear out your heart and make you feast upon it!"
"115740052-0-18022";"What death do you prefer, mortal? Slow and painful, or quick and painful?"
"115740052-0-18023";"Here are the <<mz:1>>. A little dusty, but they'll do."
"115740052-0-18024";"I think I'll kill you quickly, then resurrect you and kill you slowly—an eternity of agony. It will be glorious."
"115740052-0-18025";"Aieeeee!"
"115740052-0-18026";"Quite simple to use. Point it at the Daedra you want to absorb and the <<z:1>> does the rest."
"115740052-0-18027";"Vampire or bloodfiend, you will fall to Adusa's terribly swift blades! Oh, it's just you. Never mind, then."
"115740052-0-18028";"This doesn't look like a safe place. I'm going back into hiding!"
"115740052-0-18029";"I don't think so."
"115740052-0-18030";"What in Oblivion? What is this? Release me, at once! Release me, or I'll tear this plane apart!"
"115740052-0-18031";"Ignore it. Just empty threats. It knows it's trapped."
"115740052-0-18032";"You insufferable mortals! I'll shroud you all in unending dream, make you face your worst nightmares! You'll die clawing your eyes out, I swear it!"
"115740052-0-18033";"It's losing the fight. The stone just needs to hold a little bit longer."
"115740052-0-18034";"I have plenty of time to wait, mortal. Eventually, you'll slip, and your prison will fail. Then I will cover you in nightmares."
"115740052-0-18035";"Draven! What's going on? No one will tell me a thing!"
"115740052-0-18036";"Come and sit, dear. Everything will be all right."
"115740052-0-18037";"I can't be the only one who thinks something strange is going on!"
"115740052-0-18038";"Kerbol and the lot of them! They're some kind of cult!"
"115740052-0-18039";"Renoit … let it rest. Soon I'll be better—doesn't that count for something?"
"115740052-0-18040";"Yes, that's it! <<AC:1>> thirsts for souls!"
"115740052-0-18041";"And if I twist, just so …."
"115740052-0-18042";"The power! I'd forgotten how it feels!"
"115740052-0-18043";"Follow, outsider. Come see my Prince's glorious domain!"
"115740052-0-18044";"You won't leave here alive!"
"115740052-0-18045";"Look what happened! They came out of nowhere. Captain Janeve is missing, half the refugees are dead. Healer Odylie is doing what she can to help."
"115740052-0-18046";"What've you done to my husband?"
"115740052-0-18048";"I'll see you back in Thormar, dearie."
"115740052-0-18049";"No! You won't defeat me again!"
"115740052-0-18050";"You've nowhere to fly, fiend! You can't escape me!"
"115740052-0-18051";"<<1>>! You live?"
"115740052-0-18052";"Yes, <<1>>. Despite your efforts!"
"115740052-0-18053";"My Prince's children were legion! They should have overwhelmed you!"
"115740052-0-18054";"Molag Bal's chattel are nothing to me."
"115740052-0-18055";"Blasphemy!"
"115740052-0-18056";"Stranger! If you're a foe to Molag Bal, stand with me!"
"115740052-0-18057";"Fools! I'll feast upon your eyes!"
"115740052-0-18058";"Ugh. Disgusting."
"115740052-0-18059";"There's no turning back now, Draven. You are a part of this village now."
"115740052-0-18060";"I'll let you handle this one. I'll take the next."
"115740052-0-18061";"We showed them!"
"115740052-0-18062";"Don't be alarmed. Soon the pain will subside."
"115740052-0-18063";"No … stop! You're in my head!"
"115740052-0-18064";"Don't interrupt the ritual!"
"115740052-0-18065";"Divines protect me!"
"115740052-0-18066";"Are they gone? I thought you were going to take me to the barn."
"115740052-0-18067";"We'll do this together, then. You fight them head-on. I'll strike from the shadows."
"115740052-0-18068";"Ah, the good ol' library! Read many of the books here myself. I love the ones with all the pictures in them."
"115740052-0-18069";"Feast, my children! Feast on bones and blood!"
"115740052-0-18072";"No! I've lost control!"
"115740052-0-18073";"Draven! Come back!"
"115740052-0-18074";"Everyone, stay calm!"
"115740052-0-18075";"We will soon have this back in hand. Keep faith, my friends."
"115740052-0-18076";"Renoit, bring Draven to the town hall. Stranger, come with me."
"115740052-0-18077";"Please, don't leave yet. Can I talk to you?"
"115740052-0-18078";"Draven? What's happened!"
"115740052-0-18079";"Vestige! Meet me at the Harborage! We are ready to reclaim the Amulet of Kings!"
"115740052-0-18080";"You're not far now. Through the door, and to the summit!"
"115740052-0-18081";"Filthy Ra Gada! I'll pick my teeth with your bones!"
"115740052-0-18082";"Stupid Redguard! You served your purpose. Now you will die!"
"115740052-0-18083";"You are not welcome here! We will defend our land!"
"115740052-0-18084";"You are not welcome here! We will defend our land!"
"115740052-0-18085";"This must be what we're looking for. Amazing. It's as though it has been waiting for us all of this time."
"115740052-0-18086";"No! How dare you, mortal?"
"115740052-0-18087";"I am the Artificer, madam! That's why I dare!"
"115740052-0-18088";"I'm staying here."
"115740052-0-18089";"Can you feel it? That energy in the air! The spell is working!"
"115740052-0-18090";"You could have hidden that amulet anywhere in Tamriel, and this was your first choice?"
"115740052-0-18091";"It seemed like a good idea at the time."
"115740052-0-18092";"Those shades … they were going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-18093";"Thank you! I can make it back to camp from here."
"115740052-0-18094";"That is indeed an immense relief, Hjurrun. Gives us room to breathe. But it doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels."
"115740052-0-18095";"I know. It's only one victory, Your Grace, but I hope it's a sign of more to come."
"115740052-0-18096";"I do too, but that's going to require more work on both our parts, and there's nothing for it but to get it done. You're dismissed, Captain."
"115740052-0-18097";"At last. After all these years …."
"115740052-0-18098";"I don't want to die!"
"115740052-0-18099";"That was an impressive show of combat prowess, stranger!"
"115740052-0-18100";"I'm not comfortable following you out there. I'll just go back to my favorite hiding spot now."
"115740052-0-18101";"What have you done?"
"115740052-0-18102";"Ah, there you are. Come, we must talk."
"115740052-0-18103";"Hmmmmmmm…"
"115740052-0-18104";"Lyris? Is this true, child?"
"115740052-0-18105";"You were always so cold. So distant. My mother died giving me life. It was my fault! I should never have been born!"
"115740052-0-18106";"Lyris, look at me. The blood of giants flows through my veins. Your mother was a Nord. I gave her my seed without thought for her safety. That's why she died. Not because of you, child. Because of me!"
"115740052-0-18109";"I thought you blamed me. You … you couldn't even look at me, Papa!"
"115740052-0-18110";"Do you not see? When I looked at you, I saw her face. I loved her, child. Just as I love you—more than life itself. We cannot change the past, nor should we cling to it. You must not let these feelings haunt you. Let them go. Let me go."
"115740052-0-18111";"I love you too, Papa. Rest now. Be at peace."
"115740052-0-18112";"He's gone. Come on, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-18113";"No! You can't!"
"115740052-0-18116";"After a careful review of the evidence provided to this court …."
"115740052-0-18117";"That was unpleasant."
"115740052-0-18118";"Do you hear that? Like a scratching sound? Something's coming!"
"115740052-0-18119";"I find Aranak the merchant guilty as charged."
"115740052-0-18120";"We find the evidence presented inadequate to prove the guilt of Aranak the merchant."
"115740052-0-18121";"Advocate, we have asked much of you in this terrible affair, but I must rely upon you for one final sacred task. Please escort the prisoner to the judgment chamber below."
"115740052-0-18122";"Advocate, please return once you have reviewed your findings and are ready to present us with a different set of evidence."
"115740052-0-18124";"Oh no!"
"115740052-0-18125";"We have to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-18129";"The streets are dangerous. We should check the homes. Be neighborly. See if those inside know where the scouts are."
"115740052-0-18130";"I'm sorry. I never meant to bring this on the village."
"115740052-0-18132";"Is that … ? Shor's bones, it is! Vestige, that's my battle axe!"
"115740052-0-18133";"Mannimarco? How did you find this place?"
"115740052-0-18134";"Get out of here! Follow Tharayya—I'll cover your escape!"
"115740052-0-18135";"Do you really think I'd allow you to escape the Halls of Torment if I couldn't track your every movement?"
"115740052-0-18136";"Sai, no! Mannimarco, stop! You're killing him!"
"115740052-0-18137";"Where is the Amulet of Kings?  My master, Molag Bal, demands it!"
"115740052-0-18138";"Your master. Please! You would use the amulet to betray Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-18139";"Fools! What are you doing out there?"
"115740052-0-18140";"I'm getting out of here. I recommend you do the same."
"115740052-0-18141";"This mayor seems a charming fellow. We should decide what must be done about him."
"115740052-0-18142";"Can you feel her suffering, her agony?"
"115740052-0-18143";"For a thousand years her pain tunneled through the void, always reaching for her last memories of a life free of suffering."
"115740052-0-18144";"No more!"
"115740052-0-18145";"Come. We end this today."
"115740052-0-18146";"Persistent, aren't you? Do you really think you can keep me from acquiring the amulet?"
"115740052-0-18147";"The Amulet of Kings is under the protection of Stendarr's ward! It will never be yours!"
"115740052-0-18149";"You're insane if you think you can betray the God of Schemes!"
"115740052-0-18150";"I find Spinner Eranas guilty as charged."
"115740052-0-18151";"I find the Spinner's wife Gathiel guilty as charged."
"115740052-0-18152";"This island belongs to the Maormer!"
"115740052-0-18153";"They can't be allowed to interfere. Eliminate them!"
"115740052-0-18154";"We find the evidence presented inadequate to prove the guilt of Spinner Eranas."
"115740052-0-18155";"We find the evidence presented inadequate to prove the guilt of Gathiel, the Spinner's Wife."
"115740052-0-18158";"So be it."
"115740052-0-18159";"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just … I was afraid to die."
"115740052-0-18160";"Please. A moment, my friends. I … I must rest before we continue."
"115740052-0-18161";"Sai? Are you all right? That bastard really hurt you, didn't he? I swear to the gods I'll take his head off!"
"115740052-0-18162";"I'll be fine, Snow Lily. I just need a moment to catch my breath."
"115740052-0-18163";"That wasn't so difficult, was it? Now, let's head to my laboratory. We'll need that scroll to get into the cathedral."
"115740052-0-18164";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-18165";"There! I helped! Mother always says I should help others. Just squeeze through there!"
"115740052-0-18166";"No, please! I don't want to stay here!"
"115740052-0-18167";"It's no use! Get out of there or the lightning will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-18171";"My pet! I'll tear your throat out for that."
"115740052-0-18172";"Shatter the <<mz:1>>! They shackle <<2>> to this wretched place!"
"115740052-0-18173";"And how am I supposed to trust you?"
"115740052-0-18174";"This one could have overpowered you at any time. Now stand down or Adusa will stick that sword where the Bright Moons never shine."
"115740052-0-18175";"Please—I need you to kill me."
"115740052-0-18176";"What? How dare you! Oh, very well! I'll just go and sit down or something."
"115740052-0-18177";"Another projection. Let's follow it."
"115740052-0-18178";"I'm free!"
"115740052-0-18179";"Didn't think you had it in you! But the storm's clearing. We should head to my laboratory."
"115740052-0-18180";"Ha! I'm sorry, I just … I wasn't expecting that. We should head to my laboratory, now that the storm's clearing and all."
"115740052-0-18181";"It is done."
"115740052-0-18185";"Now where did she … ah, yes! It's on my desk. Yes, over there, do you see it?"
"115740052-0-18187";"Let's head to the cathedral. We're the last people the mayor will expect!"
"115740052-0-18189";"Blood for blood."
"115740052-0-18190";"If you have a moment, I would appreciate a word."
"115740052-0-18191";"… thank you …."
"115740052-0-18192";"The portal is open! Go, now. Return with the Amulet of Kings!"
"115740052-0-18193";"I didn't survive the terrors of Crestshade just to die out here in the middle of nowhere!"
"115740052-0-18194";"Monsters, they attacked the camp. I'm leaving, but if you plan to linger here, you should talk to Healer Odylie. Good luck to you!"
"115740052-0-18195";"I've a surprise for you, Sai. Do you remember your fallen comrades from the Dragonguard? I've taken the liberty of raising them, and they're quite anxious to see you."
"115740052-0-18196";"No! You will not take my grandchildren from me!"
"115740052-0-18197";"You aren't who I was expecting. Good. I didn't really want to kill Adusa just yet. You, on the other hand? I will enjoy feasting on your blood!"
"115740052-0-18198";"Clothes are fine. The poison wasn't in the stream."
"115740052-0-18199";"Hmm. The meat is cooked past the point of edibility, but no poison."
"115740052-0-18200";"If it's not the well water, we'll need to rethink this."
"115740052-0-18201";"Wait, do you smell that?"
"115740052-0-18202";"I never wanted Yahyif to die."
"115740052-0-18203";"I know what you're trying to do. Now shut it."
"115740052-0-18204";"He was your best friend."
"115740052-0-18205";"I said shut it!"
"115740052-0-18206";"Is that the mayor? Wait, I recognize him! Let me see if I can talk some sense into him."
"115740052-0-18207";"Your cargo's unloaded and I'm here for my payment. I hope you don't come to regret this, Hjurrun."
"115740052-0-18208";"If I come to regret this, I'll probably be dead anyways. I don't expect you to understand, Captain. Here's your payment."
"115740052-0-18209";"Thanks. When are you and your ""allies"" making your move? I want to make sure I'm long gone by then."
"115740052-0-18210";"We're arming everyone up at the weapons cache in the south alley in just a few hours, so I'd set sail right away. Kyne speed you, Captain."
"115740052-0-18211";"Help! Please… we need help here."
"115740052-0-18212";"The shrine is on the far side of the room. Quickly, we must find our way across!"
"115740052-0-18213";"Again, the King of Worms defiles the memory of the honored dead! I have no wish to disfigure the corpses of my old comrades of the Dragonguard, but we must consecrate the shrine."
"115740052-0-18214";"Who's there? How did you get in? Go, I want to be alone!"
"115740052-0-18215";"Don't you recognize me, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-18216";"<<1>>! Thank the Divines. <<2>> did this, all of it. He used me!"
"115740052-0-18217";"And how exactly did he use you?"
"115740052-0-18218";"He promised me power, the respect I deserve … but then he cursed my tongue with madness and let me make a mess of this town!"
"115740052-0-18219";"You're so pitiful, even for a mortal."
"115740052-0-18220";"What?"
"115740052-0-18222";"You heard me!"
"115740052-0-18224";"Take all the time you need. I'll keep watch. If there's anything I can do, just name it."
"115740052-0-18227";"The altar is on the far side, but to reach it, the drawbridge must be lowered."
"115740052-0-18228";"You did it! The bridge is down!"
"115740052-0-18229";"You really are starting to annoy me. Kill them!"
"115740052-0-18234";"I've always wanted to meet a person within a person! Tell me, what's it like?"
"115740052-0-18237";"I'm … I'm so sorry, <<1>>! I thought you'd abandoned me!"
"115740052-0-18238";"Aulie, I left you a tongue that drives people mad! But I suppose if you don't want my gift, I can take it from your mouth and give it to my new favorite mortal friend."
"115740052-0-18239";"No! Think of all I've built here, the wonderful screams I've created, all in your name. Doesn't that make me your favorite?"
"115740052-0-18240";"Oh, very well. Sorry, my second favorite mortal friend! We had a good run, but it's time for your curtain call."
"115740052-0-18241";"What a foul sensation!"
"115740052-0-18242";"I'm sure we'll meet again, you and I."
"115740052-0-18243";"If you're headed to Crestshade, you need to know. There was trouble there."
"115740052-0-18244";"Be careful in there. I need to get to Shornhelm and give my report."
"115740052-0-18245";"Apologies for my lateness."
"115740052-0-18246";"Good! Now the other!"
"115740052-0-18247";"That's it! Quickly, free <<1>> from the altar!"
"115740052-0-18249";"I've heard enough! I'll be outside."
"115740052-0-18250";"You, outsider! Bandits broke into the village!"
"115740052-0-18251";"Look, it's Lady Laurent!"
"115740052-0-18252";"Wonderful. It's Telenger."
"115740052-0-18253";"The captain in charge of security, Alphaury, is over there."
"115740052-0-18255";"Good, you're finally coming out of it. We should … reintroduce ourselves."
"115740052-0-18257";"I swear by Stendarr's grace and the sword of my father, you will not win, Mannimarco!"
"115740052-0-18258";"Your pathetic efforts will not succeed! The Amulet of Kings will be mine!"
"115740052-0-18259";"Through the power of the Amulet of Kings, I will be transformed!"
"115740052-0-18260";"Champion. It is time. You are at the end of your path."
"115740052-0-18262";"As the Lunar Champion, you have proven yourself time and time again a leader of our people, but do you truly understand what it means to be the Mane?"
"115740052-0-18263";"Yes. I've walked the path and know what lies ahead and honor those left behind."
"115740052-0-18265";"You've begun the path and know what lies ahead of our people. Are you prepared to lead your people?"
"115740052-0-18266";"Yes, I accept this role in service of kith and kin."
"115740052-0-18267";"Then wear this as leader of our people and rise, Mane of our people."
"115740052-0-18268";"Continue the path, young one, and accept this blessing for the journey ahead."
"115740052-0-18269";"Rejoice one and all! Long live the Mane!"
"115740052-0-18270";"Draven, wait!"
"115740052-0-18271";"We can't go through the town. Not after what's happened."
"115740052-0-18272";"Renchant, you bastard … I rue the day I gave you the throne. What you've done … is nothing less than treason."
"115740052-0-18273";"Guard! Come get this coward out of my sight!"
"115740052-0-18274";"Such despair! Richer than a cheese sorbet!"
"115740052-0-18275";"Yes, Your Majesty. As you wish."
"115740052-0-18276";"I'll come quietly, Guardsman."
"115740052-0-18277";"Now that he's been dealt with, we have real work to do. Please, meet me outside."
"115740052-0-18278";"<<1>> is near those glowing stones. Be careful!"
"115740052-0-18279";"The time has come to demonstrate the true power of my kind. We are not simply monsters who eat children! We are so much more."
"115740052-0-18280";"One last quest, old chap! One last leap into the fire! Unless we survive, of course. But how likely is that?"
"115740052-0-18281";"You've come through these trials and emerged victorious."
"115740052-0-18282";"And make it entertaining, would you? After spending so much time in this town, I finally know where the Colovians keep their fur hats."
"115740052-0-18283";"I know I can activate the welkynd stones. Let's see what happens."
"115740052-0-18284";"Bridge is out! My boredom washed it away. Really got in the cracks, there!"
"115740052-0-18286";"Very well then. Arzhela, my fate is in your hands. You know I made the only rational choice."
"115740052-0-18287";"I was wondering when you were going to arrive, Adusa."
"115740052-0-18288";"I wouldn't call it rational, Renchant. I would call it cowardly. Eamond died defending this kingdom … and you'll die for betraying it."
"115740052-0-18289";"Mara's bosom, Bugbekh! What do you plan on burying out here? A mammoth?"
"115740052-0-18290";"It was for King Eamond—but then I hear that they carted his body south to Bangkorai Garrison."
"115740052-0-18291";"I had no idea the King was that fat."
"115740052-0-18292";"Watch your tongue you lout. Our king was a good and honest man. It's a tragedy what happened to him."
"115740052-0-18293";"Yes, yes, whatever you say. You never did answer my question though. What is this hole for?"
"115740052-0-18294";"Well we can't bury the king here so we got the next best thing."
"115740052-0-18295";"If only I could turn back time … just a few hours …."
"115740052-0-18296";"What's that?"
"115740052-0-18297";"His horse …. Mauloch's jawbone, I've got a lot of work to do."
"115740052-0-18298";"Medya, what is it? Is Sir Etienne all right?"
"115740052-0-18299";"I had to dig three more crows out of my chimney flue this morning. We may have suffocated if not for the dog barking."
"115740052-0-18300";"Believe me, I can empathize. I've found bird droppings in my porridge twice in the last week."
"115740052-0-18301";"I've never seen the like. What could be causing it?"
"115740052-0-18302";"Witchcraft I should think. Or maybe something with the weather. Who knows—I'm hardly a scholar."
"115740052-0-18303";"Well I'm off to Shara's shop to buy a bow and arrow."
"115740052-0-18304";"Are you sure that's wise? If there truly is a hex on this town, I'd give those crows a wide berth."
"115740052-0-18305";"Perhaps you're right. Maybe I'll just buy a cat and see what happens."
"115740052-0-18306";"Do what you want. I have nothing left to live for."
"115740052-0-18307";"Hey you, please wait!"
"115740052-0-18308";"Here she comes now …. Rashan. We have a volunteer to destroy Uela's totems."
"115740052-0-18312";"Why do I get the feeling we're going to regret this?"
"115740052-0-18313";"This is your chance to fix this mess. Go, deal with the ""mayor."" If <<1>> bores him, <<2>> will leave."
"115740052-0-18314";"There. That place should serve us well. Let us assemble and prepare the ritual."
"115740052-0-18316";"Kill this worm."
"115740052-0-18317";"Abnur, why don't you show this puppet, magic's true potential?"
"115740052-0-18318";"This just isn't your day. But your Uncle <<1>> can make it better!"
"115740052-0-18320";"What is this?"
"115740052-0-18321";"This has got to be the source of the spell. Let's destroy it!"
"115740052-0-18323";"Free Will! Get out here, there's someone I want you to meet!"
"115740052-0-18326";"Renoit! Stay back!"
"115740052-0-18327";"Look what we have here."
"115740052-0-18328";"Quiet … I think I hear something."
"115740052-0-18329";"What is this?"
"115740052-0-18330";"It's time you paid for what you did to our world."
"115740052-0-18331";"He's doing fine. And when he returns, you all will leave?"
"115740052-0-18332";"We'll stay until Murcien's Hamlet is free, or Sir Etienne and I both fall in the fight."
"115740052-0-18333";"I see. Well, he'll be resting comfortably soon, don't you fret."
"115740052-0-18334";"Sai Sahan! Intruders … cultists … they attacked the abbey. So many of my students have fallen …."
"115740052-0-18335";"It's Draven! It's got to be! Come on!"
"115740052-0-18336";"The abbey is in ruins, Kasura! How could they …?"
"115740052-0-18337";"Let's go. There's nothing left for us in this town."
"115740052-0-18338";"A gigantic beast … like nothing I've ever seen! The cultists … they're opening rifts to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-18339";"Save your strength, Kasura. We will make them pay, I promise you!"
"115740052-0-18340";"Draven? Oh, you're … back to a werewolf."
"115740052-0-18341";"You'll pay for this, Kerbol!"
"115740052-0-18342";"Draven is no more. He's an animal, only fit to be put down!"
"115740052-0-18343";"Save our village! Strike down the beast!"
"115740052-0-18344";"I'll go see to the poor knight now, then."
"115740052-0-18345";"This looks like the place. I guess you're the one who's going in."
"115740052-0-18346";"He's gone. I can only hope he'll be all right."
"115740052-0-18347";"Foul troll. Begone!"
"115740052-0-18348";"I'm sorry, Renoit. Gods be with you."
"115740052-0-18349";"No! What've you done?"
"115740052-0-18350";"Aha! More knucklebones for my necklace!"
"115740052-0-18351";"Remember, with gusto! A big steaming pile of it!"
"115740052-0-18352";"There. Back in the physical realm. Time to do this."
"115740052-0-18353";"Good. Good, he's all right. Now, let's go over what we need."
"115740052-0-18354";"All right! The door should be open now! Go get me that heart!"
"115740052-0-18355";"He's locked the door!"
"115740052-0-18356";"There must be some way to unlock it. Check around the altars."
"115740052-0-18357";"Stand back from the door. This will take but a moment."
"115740052-0-18358";"Confound that beast. Let's get moving! Looks like someone opened the door ahead."
"115740052-0-18359";"It is done."
"115740052-0-18360";"What do you mean, coming to kill me?"
"115740052-0-18361";"It's a gift! A chance to shine, to prove you have some backbone that won't snap at the lightest touch! Really, Aulie, I'm quite fond of you. Mmm. Fondue. What was I saying?"
"115740052-0-18362";"That you're fond of me. That you don't want to watch me die!"
"115740052-0-18363";"Watch you die horribly, all alone, and laughing my head off when it happens? That doesn't sound like me. Does it? But I'm sure you can work the matter out for yourself."
"115740052-0-18364";"Good! Looks like everyone ended up in the right place. Let's get to our positions."
"115740052-0-18365";"Please, don't do this! Maybe we can work something out?"
"115740052-0-18371";"My friend tells me something's stirred up the Wood Orcs again."
"115740052-0-18372";"Gods, I need help! My liege, no!"
"115740052-0-18373";"Pah! This one has had enough of Wood Orcs for a lifetime."
"115740052-0-18374";"The Bramblebreach clan is under constant attack, lately."
"115740052-0-18375";"No doubt the Dominion will offer their help, in exchange for an alliance. Turning the misfortunes of others to their advantage. That is their way."
"115740052-0-18376";"I hear that someone drove the Wood Orcs away from Bramblebreach."
"115740052-0-18377";"This one heard the same. Heard they ran away like cowards."
"115740052-0-18378";"All except for their War Captain. He stayed and fought."
"115740052-0-18379";"It's good for the Bramblebreach, but this one wonders how long their isolationist ways can last. Wood Orcs aren't the only threats in Valenwood."
"115740052-0-18380";"I heard an interesting story the other day."
"115740052-0-18381";"Not another of your stories."
"115740052-0-18382";"The Wood Elves deep in the forest say there's a being called the Wilderking who shapes Valenwood."
"115740052-0-18383";"Sounds like a load of superstition to me."
"115740052-0-18384";"Strange happenings in the Court of the Wilderking. Did you hear?"
"115740052-0-18385";"More Wilderking nonsense."
"115740052-0-18386";"No nonsense. This is real. They say an Altmer girl saved his life, and then took his place."
"115740052-0-18387";"You are too gullible, friend."
"115740052-0-18389";"Something's wrong. I know it! What aren't you telling me?"
"115740052-0-18391";"There. Come, let us speak of <<1>>."
"115740052-0-18392";"This one hears that people are fleeing Longhaven."
"115740052-0-18393";"I've heard the same. Bad business that. They say people are disappearing on the moors."
"115740052-0-18394";"Dark moons! This one feels nothing but pity, nothing but pity."
"115740052-0-18395";"Jone and Jode! This one hears there were vampires discovered in Longhaven!"
"115740052-0-18396";"Aye, a Dunmer vampire hunter and another hero drove them out and dispelled the evil mist from the moors."
"115740052-0-18397";"Good. This one couldn't rest easy, knowing there's vampires around."
"115740052-0-18398";"This way. I'm in here."
"115740052-0-18399";"What's happening? I hear the Thalmor has issued a call to arms."
"115740052-0-18400";"Aye, and Treethane Fariel has sent word to the other Treethanes. It's a Maormer invasion."
"115740052-0-18402";"Maormer? Where?"
"115740052-0-18403";"Seaside Sanctuary. Rumor has it the Veiled Heritance is involved, too. Those traitors just won't give up."
"115740052-0-18404";"Did you hear? The Maormer are defeated!"
"115740052-0-18405";"Indeed. Treethane Fariel has issued word saying Vicereeve Pelidil was responsible."
"115740052-0-18406";"That toad? Really?"
"115740052-0-18407";"I just hope this is the end of the Veiled Heritance. We have too many external enemies to fight ourselves."
"115740052-0-18408";"The queen should be here any moment … I hope, at least."
"115740052-0-18409";"Chim-el Adabal. The Amulet of the Kings of Glory. An artifact of the Divines, a badge of office for the ruling emperors of Cyrodiil, and the key to my ascendancy. Yet it eludes me."
"115740052-0-18410";"Exploiting its power to bring about the calamity of our age was intoxicating. It made me aware of the limitless possibilities available to one strong enough, and fearless enough, to use it to achieve his own ends."
"115740052-0-18411";"The Amulet has the power to create or destroy. But it also has the power to undo the damage caused by the Soulburst, to mend the tear in the barrier between Nirn and Oblivion.\n\nI must recover it before some fool fixes that which must remain broken."
"115740052-0-18412";"I never thought I'd see so many strangers in Valenwood."
"115740052-0-18413";"These are frightening times. We must all band together."
"115740052-0-18414";"True enough. I worry about my sister. She's stationed at the Moonhenge Outpost, and there's been rumors of Daedric activity there for some time."
"115740052-0-18415";"Daedra? Auri-El help us!"
"115740052-0-18416";"Can you believe what happened at Moonhenge?"
"115740052-0-18417";"I heard. A Daedric invasion in the Ayleid ruins."
"115740052-0-18418";"I heard that a scout team entered the Daedric portal and found an exact copy of Moonhenge on the other side. They had to destroy it all to close the portal."
"115740052-0-18419";"We're lucky to have such heroes."
"115740052-0-18420";"He knows of our plan to use the amulet to set things right! We must rescue Sai Sahan before he can be broken."
"115740052-0-18421";"Have you heard what's happening to the Heart of Valenwood? Undead everywhere. They say Prince Naemon's involved."
"115740052-0-18422";"I thought Prince Naemon was dead."
"115740052-0-18423";"They say he's come back as a lich, and he's raising an undead army in Hectahame, and corrupting the Heart in the process! If it's true, it'll destroy Valenwood."
"115740052-0-18424";"Y'ffre save us from undead armies and Altmeri royal feuds!"
"115740052-0-18425";"Did you hear Queen Ayrenn's latest proclamation? Her brother is to be interred shortly. A royal funeral."
"115740052-0-18426";"After all the trouble he's caused?"
"115740052-0-18427";"It wasn't him. They've uncovered papers belonging to Pelidil and Kinlady Estre showing that they conspired with the Veiled Heritance to raise Naemon from the dead and use him as a figurehead."
"115740052-0-18428";"There's no sin an Altmer can't erase with a little paperwork, eh?"
"115740052-0-18429";"Head up the stairs and through the door. My construct will join you shortly."
"115740052-0-18431";"Sai, the Titan returns!"
"115740052-0-18432";"Vestige! Now is the time! You must ascend the path and face the Daedric Prince!"
"115740052-0-18434";"Clear! Take up positions!"
"115740052-0-18435";"I don't like this. Where's the Magus-General? It's not like a Tharn to be late."
"115740052-0-18436";"I won't sit here and let you do all the work!"
"115740052-0-18437";"Impatience is hardly the mark of a strong ruler, Your Majesty."
"115740052-0-18438";"I congratulate you, little insect. Your sting is formidable."
"115740052-0-18439";"You have bested me and released a thousand times a thousand souls back into the Mundus."
"115740052-0-18440";"For the moment, your world is spared, but my grand scheme has only begun to unfold. Excellent. Your power shall prove useful in the coming conflicts."
"115740052-0-18441";"You have a powerful ally. Did you know that she would bring you here? What future role has she to play in this grand, cosmic farce, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-18442";"The dark machinations of Oblivion are far more complex than anything your mortal senses can comprehend."
"115740052-0-18443";"You've made a great and terrible enemy this day. Your world would have been better off if the Planemeld had succeeded. Had you bowed before me and accepted eternal servitude, I would have protected you. There are worse masters than I. Far worse."
"115740052-0-18444";"You are but a phantom here in my domain, Stone-Fire. The mortal prophecies of the Scrolls have been fulfilled. Leave this place and return to your pit!"
"115740052-0-18445";"When you're queen, you're welcome to set a finer example, Magus-General."
"115740052-0-18446";"Bah! Your meddling has already cost me too much, accursed creature of light and flame. This farce no longer amuses me."
"115740052-0-18447";"That's one honor I do not seek. What I do seek, is the unconditional surrender of Evermore."
"115740052-0-18448";"Gods, that felt good!"
"115740052-0-18449";"Vestige! Take the Amulet of Kings while I summon a portal!"
"115740052-0-18450";"You came all this way just to make absurd demands? I'm surprised."
"115740052-0-18451";"Hardly absurd, Arzhela. I tried the soft approach with the duke, but you spoiled that effort. I've come to make one final offer: surrender, or you will die."
"115740052-0-18452";"Your threats carry little weight, Septima. Bangkorai Garrison still stands between us, and it does not fall easily, or did you miss that in your history lessons?"
"115740052-0-18453";"Those who hide in the shadows of the past are crushed when its structures come tumbling down … Bangkorai Garrison has already fallen. My legionaries walk its battlements even now."
"115740052-0-18454";"Is this another of your lies? I don't care. It's clear you want a war. And if that's what you want, you can have it!"
"115740052-0-18455";"What the … ? She's not even here! It's an illusion!"
"115740052-0-18456";"Ha! Just remember, you struck first, Arzhela. Seventh Legion—Attack!"
"115740052-0-18457";"Let's go!"
"115740052-0-18458";"Ambush! Defend the queen at all cost."
"115740052-0-18459";"Fried fire salts! They're coming all right. Don't forget, we're looking to you to direct our spells. Don't worry about targeting over our allies. I promise, we won't fry the queen. Everyone—call them out when you see them!"
"115740052-0-18460";"Medya's here! Come quickly, she's not—"
"115740052-0-18461";"There's Indaenir now."
"115740052-0-18462";"How have we returned? The last thing I remember was being overwhelmed!"
"115740052-0-18463";"Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds."
"115740052-0-18464";"He is gone! Molag Bal no longer touches my mind! I'm finally free of him!"
"115740052-0-18465";"My Lord Varen, are you injured?"
"115740052-0-18466";"I'm fine, Sai. But where is Tharn? I do not hear his steps or his breath."
"115740052-0-18467";"Sad, isn't it? The poor child."
"115740052-0-18468";"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him."
"115740052-0-18469";"I cannot believe Snow Lily is gone. Why did she do it, My Lord?"
"115740052-0-18470";"Here now, my good man! Lyris Titanborn is a hero! She gave her life for a noble cause!"
"115740052-0-18471";"Sir Cadwell is right, Sai. We will all mourn her, but it was her choice. Her sacrifice to make."
"115740052-0-18476";"What … what happened? How did we get here? I remember being overwhelmed, but then …."
"115740052-0-18477";"Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds."
"115740052-0-18478";"Snow Lily, I …."
"115740052-0-18479";"I know, Sai. It's over. It's all over."
"115740052-0-18480";"Well then! Happy endings all around! Smashing! Who's got the brandy?"
"115740052-0-18481";"Wait, where is Tharn? Did he survive?"
"115740052-0-18482";"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him."
"115740052-0-18486";"The forest feels your weakness, Sentinel. This is treacherous ground."
"115740052-0-18487";"Enter, Demara. Was that a warning, or a threat?"
"115740052-0-18488";"Stenwick, who's this? A wyress?"
"115740052-0-18489";"Yes, child. You will know more of them soon enough."
"115740052-0-18490";"Is that so? You're more foolish than I thought, old man."
"115740052-0-18491";"Don't think anything of this. The wyrd are a strange folk."
"115740052-0-18492";"The scents of the Harborage fill the air. But what happened? How did we return? Lyris? Lyris, are you there?"
"115740052-0-18493";"Not to worry, not to worry! Lyris is fit as a fiddle, and you all seem quite intact, as well."
"115740052-0-18494";"I'm here, sire. But where's Tharn?"
"115740052-0-18495";"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him."
"115740052-0-18496";"That bastard! Sai died for that Amulet!"
"115740052-0-18497";"The Amulet's power is expended for generations to come. It will be of no use to him, now."
"115740052-0-18498";"Things feel different. Molag Bal's hold on my mind has been lifted. I am finally free of him!"
"115740052-0-18501";"<<1>>, I've been thinking. <<2>> can't truly appreciate your gift. But if you brought me to the Shivering Isles, I'd fit right in!"
"115740052-0-18503";"You want to go where you're like all the others? Where you can be a shank of bacon in a house built of bacon shanks?"
"115740052-0-18504";"No! I mean, think of how I could use your gift in a place that truly understood me."
"115740052-0-18505";"Well, I suppose you'd make a fine addition to the garden. Very well! The killing's off. Couldn't bring you to my home with more holes in you than when we first met. Just not proper."
"115740052-0-18506";"By the sword of my father, Nazir Itaf Sahan, I pledge myself to the destruction of Mannimarco and the liberation of Tamriel from the tyranny of the God of Schemes, Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-18507";"Thank you, <<1>>! Thank you so much. I can't wait to see my new home."
"115740052-0-18508";"I'll send you ahead. I need a moment to speak with my second favorite mortal. Don't mind the grummites! They always smell that way."
"115740052-0-18509";"I knew you would lead me to the ring, eventually. Give it to me!"
"115740052-0-18510";"Your presence defiles this place, Mannimarco!"
"115740052-0-18511";"You've done it! Grab <<1>> so you might free me."
"115740052-0-18512";"Give me the ring and I might spare your pathetic lives!"
"115740052-0-18513";"Rise, yes! Your bones will bow to the Black Worm!"
"115740052-0-18514";"Even death bows before me!"
"115740052-0-18515";"Don't be a stranger!"
"115740052-0-18516";"We struck down your Titan and we'll strike you down soon enough!"
"115740052-0-18517";"If you have something to say, you'll say it to my face!"
"115740052-0-18518";"The Titan was a prelude of what's to come if you continue to defy me!"
"115740052-0-18519";"I will. You are weak. Fit for little more than prey. How do you hope to wield the Sentinel's power?"
"115740052-0-18520";"I'll see you in Coldharbour, friend."
"115740052-0-18521";"Stenwick is trying to save my life! I don't know what he has planned, but I certainly owe it to him to see this through!"
"115740052-0-18522";"Defy you? Your delusions of godhood are laughable, you ignominious corpse-herder!"
"115740052-0-18523";"The child knows nothing. And he expects us to offer our blessing?"
"115740052-0-18524";"Very well, then. I'll simply take the ring from your corpses."
"115740052-0-18525";"Kneel before me!"
"115740052-0-18526";"I betrayed them, and I would do it all again, if it pleases Master Grexev."
"115740052-0-18527";"Enough. Come, let us finish the blessing and be done with it."
"115740052-0-18531";"You need to leave. I am the chieftain here! Master Grexev has made it so!"
"115740052-0-18532";"Perhaps if this one kills you, Master Grexev will bring greater wealth."
"115740052-0-18533";"The Worm Cult approaches! Come, outsider. Help us to throw them back!"
"115740052-0-18534";"That can't be the last of them! It's a break though. I'll open a portal to get us down to the queen!"
"115740052-0-18537";"All right, sisters. Let us begin the ritual."
"115740052-0-18538";"It's your moment. Go ahead. Throw the heart into the circle."
"115740052-0-18539";"This'll just take a moment."
"115740052-0-18540";"Took more out of me than I thought! Go on, give it to the poor girl. I'll be all right."
"115740052-0-18541";"Saryne! I've brought help!"
"115740052-0-18542";"This is my chance! Release me from this body, please!"
"115740052-0-18543";"Through that gate lies the Crypt of Heroes. We can enter, if you wish. But it is a foul place, where the dead are restless and angry."
"115740052-0-18544";"Now, we have only to consecrate the second shrine before we can enter the vault."
"115740052-0-18545";"You certainly did a thorough job hiding the amulet, Sai. Couldn't you have just stuffed it in a mattress or something?"
"115740052-0-18546";"The second shrine is in the chamber beyond. There is a trick to reaching it, a puzzle of sorts, but I do not recall its solution."
"115740052-0-18547";"Thank you! Thank you … I thought I would never be free."
"115740052-0-18548";"What are you doing to my clothes?"
"115740052-0-18549";"It worked! The little bugger's already thriving again! The power of nature is truly miraculous."
"115740052-0-18550";"Leaving? I trust your judgment, but we shouldn't let this wait too long. I'll do what I can in your absence."
"115740052-0-18551";"That was a nightmare."
"115740052-0-18552";"I can't believe I bought one of those imperial spies a drink!"
"115740052-0-18553";"Me neither! You should have known better when he started mouthing off about how Cyrodilic ales were the best in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-18554";"Well I …."
"115740052-0-18555";"Or when he started whispering about how the Queen wasn't fit to rule."
"115740052-0-18556";"But I …."
"115740052-0-18557";"Or when he started handing out pamphlets about the benefits of being an Imperial territory."
"115740052-0-18558";"Ugh … I always thought I was so perceptive."
"115740052-0-18559";"Garel, you know I love you like a sister, but you're about as perceptive as an elf with cropped ears."
"115740052-0-18560";"My magicka is almost depleted. It's going to take all I've got to open a portal back to the palace. Be ready!"
"115740052-0-18561";"At last, I'm nearly free!"
"115740052-0-18562";"Can't you cast any faster, Gabrielle? The Imperials can. More portals opening up!"
"115740052-0-18563";"Have you given our petition to the Queen yet?"
"115740052-0-18564";"Yes … and despite my strong objections, Her Royal Highness, Queen Arzhela, has elected to give each of you refugees a hearing where you might air your grievances."
"115740052-0-18565";"Is that so? When?"
"115740052-0-18566";"Whenever time permits. Count yourself lucky that she's even taken an interest in this shanty town. Were the Duke still in power, you'd probably be in an Imperial prison camp by now."
"115740052-0-18567";"Well it's good to have a Queen who actually cares about her people. It's a pity that we don't have a guard sergeant who feels the same way…."
"115740052-0-18568";"Believe me, there is nothing I'd fancy more than returning you to your homes. The sooner we can start cleaning up your rubbish the better."
"115740052-0-18569";"The portal to Evermore … go, Your Majesty, go!"
"115740052-0-18570";"Oh, that was exciting! And depressing. Poor Aulie, never could finish what he started. You really are a joy to watch!"
"115740052-0-18571";"Reynelle my dear. How do you fare?"
"115740052-0-18572";"Gasteau? I'm fine, thanks to our friends. Is this … an attempt to escape?"
"115740052-0-18573";"There's a chance, my dear. There's a chance. If our friends here are as powerful they seem."
"115740052-0-18574";"Your plan is to fight the Architect directly? Haven't we done enough to him?"
"115740052-0-18575";"Have we done enough to him? He's tortured us every day since our imprisonment!  You think his actions are just?"
"115740052-0-18576";"No, but I can understand his anger. We ruined him, Gasteau."
"115740052-0-18577";"I would do it again this instant if I could! Look around, Reynelle—he's a villain. These Vaults of Madness justify anything we've done to him!"
"115740052-0-18578";"So these motes are all that's left of dear Stenwick …."
"115740052-0-18579";"What's that sound? Can you hear it?"
"115740052-0-18580";"By Mauloch, It's good to be able to look up to a clear sky."
"115740052-0-18581";"I heard the crows were being controlled by a Hagraven out in Jackdaw Cove."
"115740052-0-18582";"That would make sense. Afterall, I did see a whole mess of them tear a man to pieces right in front of me."
"115740052-0-18583";"I've got to be a bit more careful with my bets. I put money on every Orc I see come through, and half the time they go into that rage of theirs and forget they need their own blood to live."
"115740052-0-18584";"Oh, not this story again! Look, the important thing is that she's dead."
"115740052-0-18585";"You should watch them spar, you know. Spend less time drinking and think of this arena as a business venture—you'll do better. I haven't lost a bet in some time because I monitor my investments."
"115740052-0-18586";"Well the bird-catchers won't like it, but whomever killed that monster is a hero through and through. Evermore might survive after all."
"115740052-0-18587";"Excuse me, did you know my husband?"
"115740052-0-18588";"That's the difference between us, Carilasse, it's always business for you. Learn how to lose a bet sometime, it's not like you're desperate for money!"
"115740052-0-18589";"I think I'm better now. Gods, what is this place?"
"115740052-0-18590";"Lady <<1>>. You denied my love, and now I deny your journey home. If you beg my forgiveness … convincingly … I'll return the Walking City from where I stole it."
"115740052-0-18591";"Please, hurry! I'm not sure how long I can survive down here."
"115740052-0-18592";"I … I can't …."
"115740052-0-18593";"My head … so dizzy … I'm all right, I'm all right."
"115740052-0-18594";"Is my ear bleeding? Everything seems bright … this can't be good."
"115740052-0-18595";"Despite the dishonorable acts of traitors and cowards, Fell's Run will go on! We will heal this rift and grow stronger as a community."
"115740052-0-18596";"We are stronger than our enemies. Just as the alliance makes the Daggerfall Covenant powerful, our mingled community makes Fell's Run great. We will get past this. We will prosper!"
"115740052-0-18597";"Well, good job, Marcella. You finally burned down the whole wamasu pen. Now what do we do?"
"115740052-0-18598";"Thank you. I hope to see you back at the camp."
"115740052-0-18599";"How about we do not speak of it? At all. Just drop the whole matter entirely."
"115740052-0-18600";"As you like. You know, this is perhaps the second time this has happened to this one."
"115740052-0-18601";"Elgenie's outdone herself."
"115740052-0-18602";"Who are you? What brings you into my home?"
"115740052-0-18603";"Already bored! Here, I brought you some presents. The shiny ones are always the best, wouldn't you say?"
"115740052-0-18604";"We—I mean, I am … grateful for your assistance. I will see you inside."
"115740052-0-18606";"You there, halt! There's great danger ahead!"
"115740052-0-18607";"You sent the Guard west? To chase a rumor? We need those troops to protect Shornhelm!"
"115740052-0-18608";"Only some of them, Baron. My father would have done the same. Captain Janeve will discover the truth and report back."
"115740052-0-18609";"How can we trust you, Count Ravenwatch? Your friendship with Montclair is well known. What did you offer those captains to betray us?"
"115740052-0-18610";"I care for the Count even less than you, Baron, but he hasn't done anything to warrant such accusations—yet."
"115740052-0-18611";"We must end this debate and take action! Make an example of the two traitors and retake the upper city! How can the two of you not see that?"
"115740052-0-18612";"Mind your tempers, gentlemen. We have a visitor. Come forward, friend, and state your business."
"115740052-0-18613";"Another outsider. What do you want?"
"115740052-0-18614";"Watch and remember what you're about to see."
"115740052-0-18615";"First, I'll expose the corruption."
"115740052-0-18616";"Look. You can see it plainly."
"115740052-0-18617";"Now to see if I can purge it."
"115740052-0-18618";"A simple thief of hearts, come to steal yours from this Walking City."
"115740052-0-18619";"Steal my heart, or still your loins? For your arrow looks aquiver."
"115740052-0-18620";"Such a lowly mouth can dine anywhere … a trait we both share. What service to our palates should we conjoin in feast!"
"115740052-0-18622";"Foul creature, be gone!"
"115740052-0-18624";"Give me a moment here. It takes a lot of energy to open a portal over this distance."
"115740052-0-18625";"Well, that didn't go as planned."
"115740052-0-18626";"That should do it. Enter when ready. We'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-18627";"I cannot sleep, and my husband will not wake. What cruel jest is this?"
"115740052-0-18628";"If the Lord of Brutality and Domination is successful, he will merge our world and his own in a terrible Planemeld. Few will survive the ordeal, and those that do will be enslaved for all eternity."
"115740052-0-18629";"Say the word, Lady <<1>>. I will allow you to sleep in my bed."
"115740052-0-18630";"Scoundrel! You think to steal me from my husband? From this city I call home?"
"115740052-0-18631";"I only stole your sleep, which I gifted to your husband. His inattention must make him harder to love."
"115740052-0-18632";"What would you know of love, monster? You have none of it—and you will have none of me!"
"115740052-0-18633";"Your protests ring hollow, Lady <<1>>. We shall see how much when I steal you away from husband and home."
"115740052-0-18634";"I should never have created this thing in the first place."
"115740052-0-18635";"Never again!"
"115740052-0-18636";"Thank you. So Peras is alive? We told that idiot not to steer us into Crimson Raider territory."
"115740052-0-18638";"I'll get a weapon and catch up to you and Rahannal!"
"115740052-0-18639";"Did those fools Dorell and Tamrith send you? Let me show you the power I've gained since joining House Montclair!"
"115740052-0-18641";"That … could've gone better …."
"115740052-0-18642";"I didn't think I had another portal in me … glad I was wrong."
"115740052-0-18643";"Well … at least some of us survived."
"115740052-0-18644";"The guards have keys that open these cages. I beg of you, please help!"
"115740052-0-18645";"I prayed that I wouldn't be left to that … that lizard's tortures."
"115740052-0-18646";"They poked and prodded me. I'm of House Tamrith! How dare they!"
"115740052-0-18647";"I never should have let Peras navigate."
"115740052-0-18648";"Bless you! Find my friends if you can—if they're still here!"
"115740052-0-18649";"You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?"
"115740052-0-18650";"You're a pig! I wouldn't have a drink with you if you were the last man alive!"
"115740052-0-18651";"What a wonderful spirit you have girl. Normally someone like yourself would be beneath me, but today I feel like taking a chance. What do you say?"
"115740052-0-18652";"It's a rat!"
"115740052-0-18653";"Suddenly I don't feel so well."
"115740052-0-18654";"Run fast friends! Follow Deepswimmer! And don't drop any poultices!"
"115740052-0-18655";"Murderer…"
"115740052-0-18656";"The guards have the keys. I'm sure my father, the ambassador from Alik'r, will reward you."
"115740052-0-18657";"You've filled entire graveyards…"
"115740052-0-18658";"Are you going to slaughter the entire town?"
"115740052-0-18659";"I knew Father would send someone for me. He's the ambassador from Alik'r, did I mention that?"
"115740052-0-18660";"Baron Montclair and his Argonian General, Reezal-Jul attacked the nobles of Shornhelm. This is an outrage!"
"115740052-0-18662";"They're gone! We can leave."
"115740052-0-18663";"I should be able to close the portal. It won't take me more than a few seconds."
"115740052-0-18664";"What happened? No. No! I'm a Goblin!"
"115740052-0-18665";"Not so fast, my friend. You don't have to deal with this on your own."
"115740052-0-18666";"The herbalists weren't lying, Knight Commander."
"115740052-0-18668";"How do you know?"
"115740052-0-18669";"This one saw the Imperials with her own two eyes!"
"115740052-0-18670";"Headed towards the crossing? How many?"
"115740052-0-18671";"This one didn't count them, but there were many."
"115740052-0-18672";"Time to make our stand then. Tell the other Baandari to be ready."
"115740052-0-18673";"Saint Pelin's blood! I'm glad you're still here!"
"115740052-0-18674";"Elara! You can't run off this way!"
"115740052-0-18677";"This Reezal-Jul seized nobles! Such brazen acts must not be tolerated, Baron!"
"115740052-0-18678";"One moment, friend. I may know something about the Fevered Mews."
"115740052-0-18679";"Indeed. It is time to act, Countess. No more talk. No more debate."
"115740052-0-18680";"It will be my pleasure! It's time to show those Montclair cowards what it means to betray the people of Rivenspire."
"115740052-0-18681";"Don't look so shocked, Eselde. It was bound to happen eventually. Our friend will go to the Mews to free the hostages and stop the reinforcements while we assault the upper city. A two-pronged approach."
"115740052-0-18682";"How can we walk in the Light if we leave innocent townsfolk to languish … wait, are you agreeing with me?"
"115740052-0-18683";"Well, all right then. Baron, if you would. Give the command and rally the Shornhelm Guard."
"115740052-0-18685";"But sister! You said this was the last time we would help the Sentinel!"
"115740052-0-18686";"Come along, then. We have a sacrifice ready."
"115740052-0-18687";"When I say, hold the bud out in your hands. Keep them steady, no matter what happens."
"115740052-0-18688";"Plunge it into the offering. Quickly!"
"115740052-0-18690";"You failed me, Sai."
"115740052-0-18691";"Why didn't you protect me?"
"115740052-0-18692";"I should have never trusted you."
"115740052-0-18693";"We made it."
"115740052-0-18694";"You'll be remembered as the hero who saved King Emeric! No one will ever know the truth!"
"115740052-0-18695";"Like you, the real Emeric will be dead. I'll destroy the Covenant, and the people will curse both your names!"
"115740052-0-18696";"Quickly! While he's blinded, we must get to the Prophet's Cell!"
"115740052-0-18697";"Come to me, my little snowbird."
"115740052-0-18698";"Your targets are Captain Siro and the Worm Cultist. Make the first move, and I'll surprise them from behind. Good hunting."
"115740052-0-18700";"Father!"
"115740052-0-18701";"Varaine Pellingare will be your opponent! Face me, dog!"
"115740052-0-18702";"Isa—Scout Isabeth, you put this company at risk by disobeying orders."
"115740052-0-18703";"Thanks to our new ally here, the wyrd agreed to help us drive out the Reachmen."
"115740052-0-18704";"I hope you've—Wyress Delphique, what is the meaning of this?"
"115740052-0-18705";"I thought as much. Captain Gaercroft. Your scout is infected."
"115740052-0-18706";"Kill her if you wish to maintain this alliance."
"115740052-0-18707";"What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-18708";"I won't kill her based on your word."
"115740052-0-18709";"Then trust your new ally's word."
"115740052-0-18710";"I'll make my own judgment! I don't take orders from you."
"115740052-0-18711";"He's gone! He's gone—but nothing's happening."
"115740052-0-18712";"Father, stop!"
"115740052-0-18713";"So it's true. I'm infected."
"115740052-0-18714";"It seems the Mad Architect's destruction did not allow us to step from this plane. Unfortunate, but we'll have to make do. He mastered this place, mastered the Daedra, somehow. Perhaps we can do the same."
"115740052-0-18715";"But what do we do? Where do we go?"
"115740052-0-18716";"We can't stay here. Not like this."
"115740052-0-18717";"You've freed them. I've sacrificed much to bring those prisoners here, to keep them … occupied. I won't allow you to compromise that. Your head will make a fitting gift for Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-18718";"What have you done? Where am I?"
"115740052-0-18719";"This vault? I built it to hold a precious treasure, deep below your Walking City. I will keep you safe, and away from … interference."
"115740052-0-18720";"I've made my decision, father."
"115740052-0-18721";"Isabeth, don't be foolish. You can't think straight."
"115740052-0-18722";"No, father. I've never been so clear."
"115740052-0-18723";"Wyress Delphique? Do it. Now, before I change my mind!"
"115740052-0-18724";"Isabeth!"
"115740052-0-18725";"Herma-Mora's wagging tongue! The door's warded. We'll never get in this way."
"115740052-0-18726";"Why have you done this? Is your heart as cold as this chamber?"
"115740052-0-18727";"Your heart is cold, Lady <<1>>. Warming it to <<2>> will unlock the prison built of your denial."
"115740052-0-18728";"Never! I would rather freeze until time's end than share one warm moment with you!"
"115740052-0-18729";"So be it. This vault shall forever hold your frozen heart! I leave my mantle to conceal the shame you caused me. Farewell, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-18730";"Not the best fit of armor I've had, but it will do."
"115740052-0-18733";"Nice kill. You interested in hunting something a little more dangerous?"
"115740052-0-18734";"Oh, the stench! Cadwell wasn't joking, was he?"
"115740052-0-18735";"Now join the audience!"
"115740052-0-18740";"This tomb was built to hold royal remains, but none remain within."
"115740052-0-18741";"We cannot slow down! We have too many mouths to feed!"
"115740052-0-18742";"I will tell <<1>>, but he will not take it well."
"115740052-0-18743";"The Prophet's cage should be just ahead. Quickly, now! We haven't much time."
"115740052-0-18745";"<<1>> will not listen. He simply cannot afford further losses."
"115740052-0-18746";"Damn … and Jode's Chariot?"
"115740052-0-18747";"They are open to suggestions, but it may already be too late."
"115740052-0-18748";"We need a way to win <<1>>'s favor …."
"115740052-0-18749";"As you will."
"115740052-0-18750";"Tell <<1>> I have something in mind."
"115740052-0-18751";"Why do you work against me? Would you have the prince spurn this blessing?"
"115740052-0-18752";"<<1>> is nearby, I'm sure of it!"
"115740052-0-18753";"Over here! Did you find anything that might help us?"
"115740052-0-18754";"You'll never take it from me!"
"115740052-0-18755";"I give myself, that the Prophet might be free!"
"115740052-0-18756";"What life comes to witness my sorrow?"
"115740052-0-18759";"The item we seek is through here. Follow me."
"115740052-0-18764";"The veil hid this gauntlet of traps from us. We need to move through this area with caution."
"115740052-0-18765";"And as for you, Suronii: Trying to escape? I'm so dissapointed. After the lovely home I provided for you."
"115740052-0-18766";"Just kill me and be done with it. I will never stop defying you."
"115740052-0-18767";"I wonder … is this book real or just another of Lleraya's illusions?"
"115740052-0-18768";"Tempting. But I think you'll be far more entertaining suffering for millennia."
"115740052-0-18769";"Arrrrrg!"
"115740052-0-18770";"There you are. I hope you didn't have any trouble finding this place."
"115740052-0-18771";"I think what we're looking for is just beyond this chamber."
"115740052-0-18772";"What a pleasant sound."
"115740052-0-18773";"She's waiting."
"115740052-0-18774";"This is it. The relic is beyond this door!"
"115740052-0-18775";"Here they come! Don't worry! Crazy Eye has your back!"
"115740052-0-18776";"Stand strong, walker! Crazy Eye sees more Imperials coming!"
"115740052-0-18777";"More coming! Come to Crazy Eye, you dungy shaveskin!"
"115740052-0-18778";"Ha! They're turning back! Spotless fighting walker! Sharp claws!"
"115740052-0-18779";"Why not give the Baandari all of our armor too? We'll just defend against the next raid with our fists and good manners!"
"115740052-0-18780";"Why do you fear me, priest? Is it because I can control what you cannot?"
"115740052-0-18781";"Your Highness, I'm sure he means no offense. Please, calm yourself!"
"115740052-0-18782";"As long as he treats me with the respect I deserve … we won't have a problem."
"115740052-0-18783";"If you have said your goodbyes, Prince Adrien, it is time."
"115740052-0-18784";"Wait! Are you sure there's no other way?"
"115740052-0-18785";"It's all right, Valyrie. I accept it, and you must too. You served me in life and saved me in death. I can be at peace now."
"115740052-0-18786";"This chill … I remember it. Goodbye Valyrie."
"115740052-0-18787";"It is done. His body and soul are at rest."
"115740052-0-18788";"You say the frost trolls surrounded your prison for how many years? Truly detestable, my lady."
"115740052-0-18789";"They've gone to see <<1>>. If you hurry, you might catch them."
"115740052-0-18793";"Return what once belonged to me, putrid mortal!"
"115740052-0-18794";"Leila, wait until we clear the way."
"115740052-0-18796";"Your pathetic Aedric trinket can't defeat me! I am Molag Bal, Lord of Domination!"
"115740052-0-18797";"The way ahead … can it be? It is! A veil has been cast upon these ruins."
"115740052-0-18798";"Did you hear that? <<1>>'s in trouble!"
"115740052-0-18799";"Reachman filth."
"115740052-0-18800";"The relic, Karnosis! Can you feel it? We're almost there!"
"115740052-0-18801";"Haste and blood! It's why you're my new favorite mortal. Well, also your buoyancy. But mostly haste and blood!"
"115740052-0-18802";"Do you have to lumber about like that? Show some …. Show some panache! A little swagger!"
"115740052-0-18803";"Not much gusto. But a smidge of verve, three jots brio … the essentials for a moxie fondue! Mmm, fondue. Hmm? What was I saying?"
"115740052-0-18804";"So, I now have an entire shipment of alchemical apparati covered in bat guano. What am I going to do with that?"
"115740052-0-18805";"You could offload the guano to some of the merchants who travel through Wrothgar. It's … Well, it won't go to waste, I'll say that."
"115740052-0-18806";"That's fine, I really don't need to hear anything else about that. Just knowing I can send it somewhere is enough."
"115740052-0-18808";"I-I'm free …?"
"115740052-0-18809";"Slaves! Subdue this pretender, than I might feast upon their pain for all eternity!"
"115740052-0-18810";"You can't stop me!"
"115740052-0-18811";"Another victim for the ranks!"
"115740052-0-18812";"With chains, they sought to bind this place in darkness and death … but the chains are broken! The garrison is ours!"
"115740052-0-18813";"You! Back to work, slave!"
"115740052-0-18818";"Meva! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-18820";"Wylon, my love, I'm afraid."
"115740052-0-18821";"You've done it! Excellent work!"
"115740052-0-18822";"Mark my words—this victory will go down in the history books! This is the day the Empire began to crumble!"
"115740052-0-18823";"Your mind is naked to me! I can taste your fear! You are fertile ground for the seeds of eternal torment!"
"115740052-0-18824";"Knights of Saint Pelin! Many of your brothers and sisters died here, but this was the purchase of their sacrifice. Be grateful and be proud!"
"115740052-0-18825";"Tamriel is ripe, and I have all of eternity to reap its harvest of flesh! Death comes for you and all children of the Mundus on black wings!"
"115740052-0-18826";"We have the bastards on the run now! Come Arzhela, come experience the joy of watching your enemies flee from battle."
"115740052-0-18827";"I am the face of pain! The souls of the damned are my weapons! You will know eons of suffering!"
"115740052-0-18828";"Hold. We've observed your travels through <<1>>, and have need of your … particular talents."
"115740052-0-18831";"Didn't expect to see you again."
"115740052-0-18832";"Give me a moment to open the portal."
"115740052-0-18833";"There you go, quickly now, enter the portal."
"115740052-0-18834";"You hear that, <<1>>? It's the last of your rebellion, collapsing upon itself."
"115740052-0-18835";"You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Come. Have a drink with me."
"115740052-0-18836";"You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?"
"115740052-0-18838";"You pig! I wouldn't have a drink with you if you were the last man on Nirn!"
"115740052-0-18839";"You're a pig! I wouldn't have a drink with you if you were the last man alive!"
"115740052-0-18841";"What a wonderful spirit you have! Normally someone like yourself would be beneath me, but today I feel like taking a chance. What do you say?"
"115740052-0-18842";"What a wonderful spirit you have girl. Normally someone like yourself would be beneath me, but today I feel like taking a chance. What do you say?"
"115740052-0-18844";"Oh sweet Tu'whacca! Save me! It's a banekin!"
"115740052-0-18845";"It's a rat!"
"115740052-0-18847";"Suddenly I don't feel so well."
"115740052-0-18848";"Suddenly I don't feel so well."
"115740052-0-18850";"Hurry, Leila. Trust me. Soon you will be healed and we can put this terrible episode behind us."
"115740052-0-18851";"What do we have here?"
"115740052-0-18852";"So another comes seeking Hermaeus Mora. Perhaps you will prove greater than Graccus. He holds the Oghma Infinium, the beginning of knowledge. Yours if you slay him. He waits in the caves below."
"115740052-0-18853";"This is iron ore! I'll get some samples. Go, tell <<1>> that with this ore, we'll have the finest weapons in <<2>>."
"115740052-0-18854";"We have a better chance of finding them if we split up and search different areas. I'll meet you later."
"115740052-0-18855";"You must do exactly as I taught you. The power of the Remnant will call to you, tempt you. You must be strong enough to withstand that lure."
"115740052-0-18856";"I'm ready for this. You know that. Stop treating me like I'm a novice, Verandis."
"115740052-0-18857";"I won't fail you. I won't let you down."
"115740052-0-18858";"You have never disappointed me, Gwendis. But the Remnant is more powerful than you can imagine. Be on your guard. Now head inside. I'll join you in a moment."
"115740052-0-18862";"Don't worry, Meva. I'll see you safely away from this place."
"115740052-0-18863";"I hereby name your house the new royal house of Shornhelm."
"115740052-0-18864";"You always put yourself last, don't you?"
"115740052-0-18865";"I give you my solemn oath, Your Majesty. I will lead the Kingdom of Shornhelm with wisdom and honor, and I pledge my eternal allegiance to you and to the Daggerfall Covenant."
"115740052-0-18866";"Nonsense. You and your friend here must destroy the Dark Anchor, or the others died in vain."
"115740052-0-18867";"Meva's account of the fangs gives me an idea."
"115740052-0-18868";"<<1>> and <<2>> working together! <<3>>, did you ever think we would see this day?"
"115740052-0-18869";"Have no fear, my darling Leila. Soon the light will wash away your pain."
"115740052-0-18870";"No, Shan-ra."
"115740052-0-18871";"It's going to work, Baron. The power of this ancient Ayleid remnant … it's almost overwhelming."
"115740052-0-18872";"Tell the queen the truth—her reign will soon end. We are enemies again, you and I."
"115740052-0-18873";"Wylon! Something feels … wrong …."
"115740052-0-18874";"Come now, smile! Only good can come of such an auspicious alliance!"
"115740052-0-18875";"It doesn't matter if you think you saw <<1>> eat a potato. I can't do anything without proof."
"115740052-0-18876";"You are wise to say so, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-18877";"Thank you, treethane. I won't have my good name sullied by this fanatic."
"115740052-0-18878";"You're going to be all right, Mother. Just hold on."
"115740052-0-18879";"I can make my way to the shore on my own. No doubt you will cause quite the distraction."
"115740052-0-18880";"A year ago, we'd have buried him up to his neck for blasphemy!"
"115740052-0-18881";"Very well. Let's go."
"115740052-0-18882";"Enough! I've given my ruling. Now, both of you, please get on with your lives. I don't want to hear any more of this."
"115740052-0-18883";"Thank you. I will see you again at the chapel in Shornhelm."
"115740052-0-18884";"The remnant will make you like new, my love! You'll be reborn!"
"115740052-0-18885";"Such flattery! Tell me. Why have you called me here?"
"115740052-0-18886";"We have a gift for you, <<1>>. To show our appreciation and solidify our friendship."
"115740052-0-18887";"Something's … happening. I feel … the power!"
"115740052-0-18889";"And I believe it has just arrived. My friend, if you would do the honors?"
"115740052-0-18891";"Anyamis alata! Malatua latta mitta jorane mori!"
"115740052-0-18892";"This is where it happened. Where Leila died and Montclair … changed."
"115740052-0-18893";"Vasha anya belda sancre!"
"115740052-0-18894";"Yes? How can I help you?"
"115740052-0-18895";"It's working! It's working! Soon the power will be ours to command!"
"115740052-0-18896";"Zungarg! Agalir! Come meet our new friend!"
"115740052-0-18897";"Aveberl, we can't stay here. Everyone seems to think I'm a vampire! It makes me uncomfortable. What if they attack me?"
"115740052-0-18898";"Well, my dear, you are rather pale. And we do tend to favor blacks and reds in our choice of fashion. And then there's the wine …."
"115740052-0-18899";"You are ignoring my point! Why must you be so … so … indifferent? It makes you impossible to deal with!"
"115740052-0-18900";"No! What … what have you done? This isn't me! I … I never wanted this!"
"115740052-0-18901";"That's the last of them. Now we can take out that Anchor! Let's finish this!"
"115740052-0-18902";"I must send word to the Dominion of what transpired here."
"115740052-0-18903";"Almalexia sees great things from you, but whether good or bad, I can't say. Thank you for your help."
"115740052-0-18904";"If we meet again, I hope it is as allies once more. Farewell."
"115740052-0-18905";"Where are Montclair's forces? I thought for sure we'd have to fight a horde of bloodfiends to make it through this place."
"115740052-0-18906";"Montclair is a strategist. He's waiting for us to make a mistake that he can take advantage of. I fear that mistake is about to be made."
"115740052-0-18907";"Soldiers, spread out! Secure this chamber!"
"115740052-0-18908";"You should have heeded my warning, Baron. This is no place for you."
"115740052-0-18909";"You would deny our moment of glory, Count? The Light shines on us this day!"
"115740052-0-18910";"Everything should be in the journal. Be careful, <<1>> has been crawling with Blacksap."
"115740052-0-18911";"There is no light here, Countess. Only darkness and death."
"115740052-0-18915";"All hail! The new ruler of Rivenspire!"
"115740052-0-18916";"I'm free …."
"115740052-0-18917";"How do you feel? Can you move?"
"115740052-0-18918";"You've come dangerously deep into the forest, my former friend."
"115740052-0-18920";"The Ashen Mines are dangerous, but they aren't as heavily patrolled as the other routes out of the prison."
"115740052-0-18921";"The God of Schemes can see every part of Coldharbour. We need to distract him."
"115740052-0-18923";"If I might have everyone's attention. I have decided to crown a new King of Shornhelm … Alard Dorell, please come forward."
"115740052-0-18924";"If I might have everyone's attention. I have decided to crown a new Queen of Shornhelm … Eselde Tamrith, please come forward."
"115740052-0-18928";"What? I thought it was bandits that captured us."
"115740052-0-18931";"Down, in the ruins of the swallowed city. That is where you will find Graccus and the Oghma Infinium. Prove yourself his better and take it."
"115740052-0-18933";"They disguised themselves as Crimson Raiders out at sea. But the bastards we fought against to free you were professionals—military-grade muskarses."
"115740052-0-18934";"I've never heard a High Elf talk like you do."
"115740052-0-18936";"Confound it. Peras, I hope you're happy. Told you it was a mistake to go through Crimson Raider waters."
"115740052-0-18937";"It was the shortest route, Filoneth! We were saving days of travel!"
"115740052-0-18938";"You could have gotten us all killed. Or worse!"
"115740052-0-18939";"Oh, please. This is the most interesting month we've had in years! You're all scholars. Be open to new experiences!"
"115740052-0-18940";"Peras, when you sleep tonight, I'm going to drown you."
"115740052-0-18941";"Need I remind you that I'm the one who saved your lives?"
"115740052-0-18942";"This is why no one likes you, Peras."
"115740052-0-18943";"You'll all feel better tomorrow morning."
"115740052-0-18945";"Tomorrow morning, you'll be dead!"
"115740052-0-18946";"We'd better get going. You lot can murder your friend on the way to Velyn Harbor."
"115740052-0-18949";"A moment, Vestige."
"115740052-0-18950";"There it is. The Dark Anchor Mooring."
"115740052-0-18951";"There. Quickly! Collect the Skyshard."
"115740052-0-18952";"We're ready. Now, cut out her heart."
"115740052-0-18953";"Put her heart in the bowl on the altar."
"115740052-0-18955";"A worthy offering. What is it you seek?"
"115740052-0-18956";"My Prince, we seek to know why—"
"115740052-0-18957";"Silence, prey! I speak not to the weak, but to the one who took the heart."
"115740052-0-18960";"This one interests me. Come. Speak to me, hunter."
"115740052-0-18965";"Hey, you there. A little help here. Damned Montclair bastards caught me snooping around."
"115740052-0-18966";"I hate being caged. Makes me all … itchy. Anyway, Orlozag shoved a letter in that chest over there. It explains a lot."
"115740052-0-18967";"I appreciate the help. You're all right in my book. Now I need to report back to Baron Dorell."
"115740052-0-18968";"Know what has come before. That you may face what lies ahead at Moonmont. Channel your passion, Khali. Protect your sister, and our people. Become what you were born to be."
"115740052-0-18970";"Learn from Khali, that you may face what lies ahead at Moonmont. Become what you were born to be."
"115740052-0-18971";"I have a plan to get us out of our debts. I'm going to help fix some fights."
"115740052-0-18972";"What are you thinking, you kitten-headed fool? You'll die! And speaking of these things out in the open like this? Idiot!"
"115740052-0-18973";"You worry too much! You will see, things will be fine soon. Just trust me."
"115740052-0-18974";"We're going to lay our trap in the abandoned village up the hill. <<1>>, you guard the west gate."
"115740052-0-18975";"No one's getting by me."
"115740052-0-18978";"May the Divines guide my bow."
"115740052-0-18979";"<<1>>, you're on the ridge by the east gate."
"115740052-0-18981";"I'll take the north. Our new friend will use the bloodstone to lay the bait in the well at the center of town."
"115740052-0-18982";"I love this part."
"115740052-0-18983";"Drop the bloodstone into the well. Blood will spout forth, and it'll draw the vampires out of hiding. We'll be waiting to cut them down."
"115740052-0-18984";"Don't joke, lest the Divines punish your frivolity."
"115740052-0-18985";"The vampire lord won't sit by while we thin his flock. If you see him, whistle."
"115740052-0-18986";"If everyone's ready, let's get into position."
"115740052-0-18987";"Listen closely. This is the plan."
"115740052-0-18988";"You remember those bandits? The ones in the fort?"
"115740052-0-18989";"Someone came through and rousted them out. Returned the artifacts to the Arkay clergy."
"115740052-0-18990";"Impressive, I guess. I think I could have done it! If I wasn't so busy."
"115740052-0-18991";"The Colovians were thrown out of Arenthia! Your wife's sister still hanging around the house?"
"115740052-0-18992";"What's that supposed to mean?"
"115740052-0-18993";"The Colovians weren't High Elves, though. What would the Arenthian Resistance have against your wife's sister?"
"115740052-0-18994";"She's still here, yes. She isn't sure it's safe for her to show her face up there."
"115740052-0-18995";"Oh you know how your people get, Aru. Once their blood is up, it's hard to back down again."
"115740052-0-18996";"Calm down, I didn't mean anything by it. Besides, I think she's just trying to get in another meal before she leaves."
"115740052-0-18997";"Did you hear those Colovian dogs were dumb enough to go after Vinedusk?"
"115740052-0-18998";"It's the truth! Heard it from my cousin. I bet they have to build more carts just to carry all the bodies back to Colovia."
"115740052-0-18999";"Baan Dar's leg, you've got to be joking.  No one would take on the Rangers in their own camp."
"115740052-0-19000";"I say they deserve it. I hope the Rangers rip them apart like a Senche with a steak."
"115740052-0-19001";"So my cousin that trades at Vinedusk Village said the Colovians were defeated."
"115740052-0-19002";"She says it's a charnel house. The Rangers burned down half their encampment to drive out the Collies!"
"115740052-0-19003";"Hah! Excellent, tell me the gory details."
"115740052-0-19004";"Delicious! This one hopes the Rangers sent them straight into Molag Bal's torture pits."
"115740052-0-19005";"I'm telling you, the Champion down at Thizzrini Arena is unbeatable."
"115740052-0-19006";"Did you hear what those crazy Wood Elves got up to in Willowgrove?"
"115740052-0-19007";"You know their ridiculous ""Green Pact?"" Well, they can't clear the forest on their own. So they hired a Mage from the guild to clear it for them. I hear he's a washout from Telenger's research crew!"
"115740052-0-19008";"This should be good. No, what did they do?"
"115740052-0-19009";"Oh, those wacky Bosmer! What will they get up to next?"
"115740052-0-19010";"Did you hear what happened with those Wood Elves in Willowgrove? Those silly Bosmer with the Mage?"
"115740052-0-19011";"Oh, no, nothing so droll. Some travelering do-gooder came through and saved them from themselves. Apparently he'd managed to summon up a forest full of Atronachs!"
"115740052-0-19012";"No! You never told me what happened. Did that failure of a Mage burn the forest to the ground?"
"115740052-0-19013";"That Ishalga is a sure bet! She's taken every challenger, she even took apart an Orc!"
"115740052-0-19014";"Get down there and make a bet quick as you can. The bet-takers are going to stop offering good odds."
"115740052-0-19015";"Did I tell you that Ishalga was unseated? Dead on the ground in the Thizzrini Arena."
"115740052-0-19016";"Some dark horse tore up through the divisions and went straight at her throat."
"115740052-0-19017";"Do you have any idea how many coins I lost in that wager? Pah. Damned show stopper."
"115740052-0-19018";"Don't eat me! Wait. You're not a spider. I'm saved! Oh thank you!"
"115740052-0-19019";"Hah! When will those backwoods creatures learn to leave magic to their betters?"
"115740052-0-19020";"Calden Malhaven may know a shortcut to the Mews. We were childhood friends, and he knows the city like the back of his hand."
"115740052-0-19021";"You'll need a key to set me free. I'm sure the guards are carrying them."
"115740052-0-19022";"That horrible Argonian, Reezal-Jul, said he would turn me into a powerful creature. Why would I want that?"
"115740052-0-19023";"Ah, sweet freedom! Thank you so much for coming to my rescue."
"115740052-0-19032";"What tantalizing work! Come to me, mortal. I would have words with you."
"115740052-0-19037";"Enough of this! You and your Ravenwatch ally there will only stand in the way of what the gods tell me! No more of this! You will all die!"
"115740052-0-19038";"So much for your light protecting you now. Crazy fanatic."
"115740052-0-19039";"You need to get up there and stop those vampires from doing whatever they're going to do. I'll get everyone out of here. Somehow. Even our Raven friends."
"115740052-0-19040";"I thought I was food for sure. Thank you! We should get out of here while we can!"
"115740052-0-19041";"Whoever kills the fewest bloodsuckers buys the drinks!"
"115740052-0-19042";"Keep pushing! Drive the bastards back or put them down!"
"115740052-0-19043";"The prince has risen! It's a miracle!"
"115740052-0-19044";"Smoke? What's going on?"
"115740052-0-19046";"What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-19047";"What does it look like? I'm clearing away some rubbish."
"115740052-0-19048";"By burning down the embassy?"
"115740052-0-19049";"I'm watching the fire! I won't let it get out of control."
"115740052-0-19050";"Unless you want the ambassador to hear about this, you'll put it out at once!"
"115740052-0-19053";"What brings you to Sancre Tor, old friends? Looking for an amulet, perhaps?"
"115740052-0-19055";"Fool! When I ascended, you could have been at my right hand, Tharn. Instead you chose to align yourself with mongrels and imbeciles. Now you'll die with them!"
"115740052-0-19056";"Now, back to my mind-numbing duties. Good luck out there."
"115740052-0-19057";"You have my thanks, friend."
"115740052-0-19058";"Are you done yet?"
"115740052-0-19059";"Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!"
"115740052-0-19061";"Naive child! You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created!"
"115740052-0-19062";"Look out! They're coming from the stables!"
"115740052-0-19063";"I think I hear something in the old smithy. Stay sharp!"
"115740052-0-19064";"I could kill these things all day."
"115740052-0-19065";"They are swarming out of the longhouse! Stand firm!"
"115740052-0-19066";"That's the last of them. Good work."
"115740052-0-19069";"Damn the Mad God! Why can't I make sense of this text! I'm such an idiot!"
"115740052-0-19070";"I see my Blacksap are no match for you."
"115740052-0-19071";"Sheogorath! You bastard, the Folium Discognitum wasn't worth an island! I'll get Eyevea back, even if it takes three lifetimes!"
"115740052-0-19072";"To identify me as your prisoner, so the Vinedusk don't kill me on sight? Very well."
"115740052-0-19073";"I'm ready to go when you are."
"115740052-0-19074";"<<1>>, I did it! I have created a sanctuary, a retreat that will endure for eons! I shall call it … Eyevea!"
"115740052-0-19075";"The king's champion is coming, Magus-General. Should we make an example of this fool?"
"115740052-0-19076";"Blasphemy! How dare you raise the honored dead to fight your battle!"
"115740052-0-19077";"It's not ""we,"" Papus. It's ""you."" I have other matters to attend to. Finish the ceremony first, then deal with the interloper."
"115740052-0-19078";"Yes, of course. The dark anchors first, then the … interloper. Thank you for this honor, Magus-General. Glory to the Empire!"
"115740052-0-19079";"Glory to the Lord of Brutality, Papus. Glory to Molag Bal."
"115740052-0-19080";"Please, let me go!"
"115740052-0-19081";"Thank Y'frre, you're not with them!"
"115740052-0-19082";"Thank you! I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-19083";"I hope you are happy. This is a dark day for us all."
"115740052-0-19085";"How … unexpected."
"115740052-0-19086";"Now! Pull him through!"
"115740052-0-19087";"Stibbons! You're your old self again!"
"115740052-0-19088";"What a hodgepodge! How is one supposed to find anything in here?"
"115740052-0-19089";"Ah yes, now I recall how it was!"
"115740052-0-19090";"I'll have this in an instant …."
"115740052-0-19091";"This is a curious one! I must have missed it on my first pass."
"115740052-0-19092";"These writings are very old indeed. How gratifying!"
"115740052-0-19093";"The tongue! Of course!"
"115740052-0-19094";"Ugh, how very disgusting!"
"115740052-0-19095";"That blowhard Dorell sent you, didn't he? Or was it sweet Tamrith? No matter. Whoever it was, they sent you to die!"
"115740052-0-19096";"Mother was our rock. I loved her so much."
"115740052-0-19097";"I do not like Mannimarco as a mortal. I think I will like him even less as a god."
"115740052-0-19098";"Now, if my calculations are correct …."
"115740052-0-19099";"This should take effect almost immediately."
"115740052-0-19100";"Father was strong, steady. He held our family together."
"115740052-0-19101";"I miss you, Marrec. You were a spoiled brat, but I loved you."
"115740052-0-19102";"Rest in peace, honored dead."
"115740052-0-19103";"Blessed Arkay, please sanctify our family and the ground they rest in. Let them find peace and keep them safe."
"115740052-0-19104";"Is nothing sacred to that worm?"
"115740052-0-19105";"The next time you hide something from the most powerful necromancer in all of Tamriel, you might reconsider hiding it in a bloody tomb!"
"115740052-0-19106";"I swear on the souls of my ancesters, I will avenge Mannimarco's blasphemy!"
"115740052-0-19107";"I am ever grateful."
"115740052-0-19108";"Sai, look out! He's raising Ra Abah!"
"115740052-0-19109";"Hold the line! They must not get the ring!"
"115740052-0-19110";"Oh no, not <<1>>."
"115740052-0-19111";"There you are! I've been looking all over Shornhelm for you."
"115740052-0-19112";"Life gets no better than this! No wind, no rain, and plenty of … entertainment."
"115740052-0-19113";"It's just as I expected. Lleraya knew I'd come here and has placed an obstacle in our way."
"115740052-0-19114";"Your words are wise, <<1>>. Now, come … sit by me and enjoy what we have to offer."
"115740052-0-19115";"Follow me! Out the back!"
"115740052-0-19116";"I followed the vampire lord right to his lair. It's in the cave, north of town."
"115740052-0-19117";"Ah, you tempt me, but this one's husband is waiting."
"115740052-0-19119";"But you have no husband here, my lord. My friends and I will see you forget your troubles."
"115740052-0-19120";"Guards, stand down! If the intruder made it here, you'll just be another notch on the scabbard."
"115740052-0-19121";"Soon, you will know the extent of my power and bow before me!"
"115740052-0-19122";"All the nations of Tamriel will bow before me! They will worship me and beg for my mercy! All will know the name of Mannimarco as their one, true god!"
"115740052-0-19125";"Come to me, spirits of the tortured. We have work to do to prepare for Nerien'eth's return!"
"115740052-0-19126";"Quick, follow him. Slay the vampire lord. For Agalir!"
"115740052-0-19130";"Well done! Let's get back to Elden Tree!"
"115740052-0-19131";"You're right! You're absolutely right! I pushed everyone away, and then hated them for leaving me behind! Thank you for helping me realize I'm the source of my own problems!"
"115740052-0-19132";"All right, lead me to my father."
"115740052-0-19133";"Stibbons, take a drink from that cup. I want to see what happens."
"115740052-0-19134";"You there. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-19135";"You'll never make a living reading all day. You need to earn some coin, Valaste!"
"115740052-0-19136";"Even Mages take their noses out of their books once in a while. You just can't stand to be around people! Pathetic."
"115740052-0-19137";"The world is a cruel place, my assistants. Mages are envied their power, and reviled for using it. We must have a place where we can study in seclusion. A place where all Mages can be safe."
"115740052-0-19138";"It's working, comrade. I can see the living past of this ruin through your eyes. Now let's move."
"115740052-0-19139";"That was <<1>>, scion of evil King Anumaril. He must have been left behind to defend the Vivicus."
"115740052-0-19140";"A shrine to the Prince of Lies. My stomache turns just to see it. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-19141";"Hold a moment! I must speak with you."
"115740052-0-19142";"A trick!"
"115740052-0-19143";"By the light, that must be the <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-19144";"My sister and I are going to bury our family. We'd be honored if you accompanied us."
"115740052-0-19146";"Marrec would come here to play all the time. It made Mother so nervous. She hated these ruins."
"115740052-0-19147";"I remember Father's ghost stories. He tried to scare us into staying away. But the stories just made Marrec more interested."
"115740052-0-19148";"Things are going to be so different now that they're gone."
"115740052-0-19149";"Thank you for coming with us. I feel safer with you nearby."
"115740052-0-19150";"Wandering into a crypt when a necromancer is about? Your curiosity will be your undoing. Rise up, fallen heroes! Kill the intruders!"
"115740052-0-19151";"Impressive. But allow me to raise an enemy that will offer a bit more of a challenge!"
"115740052-0-19152";"Can you believe it? The officers won't tell us a thing. We're not even allowed in the city!"
"115740052-0-19153";"If you have a problem, go talk to Captain Khala. I saw her giving that new transfer a piece of her mind."
"115740052-0-19154";"I saw that. She dragged the poor guy into the officers' quarters and I haven't seen either of them since."
"115740052-0-19155";"There you are! Come on, we need to take out that vampire lord! <<1>> is probably waiting for us!"
"115740052-0-19156";"I will light your way home …"
"115740052-0-19157";"This academy isn't accepting new students, mortal. Be gone."
"115740052-0-19158";"The ritual you will undergo is as old and ancient as the stars."
"115740052-0-19159";"The Father of Manbeasts demands tribute, as do I. I am his Packmaster."
"115740052-0-19160";"Kneel at the altar of our master. Listen to his words."
"115740052-0-19161";"I will have you, Vestige! Pathetic prophecies and trinkets of holy powers are fleeting! I am immortal! I am undying! Your world will drown in blood!"
"115740052-0-19162";"Is he still alive? A pity."
"115740052-0-19163";"Heed me, pup. You stand now in my hunting ground."
"115740052-0-19164";"My, my, Sir Darien. That was impressive. But when it comes to smuggler's tunnels, I think there's a thing or two I can teach you."
"115740052-0-19165";"You desire power, but have you the will?"
"115740052-0-19166";"The God of Schemes has tasted your soul. You've come back tainted. Wrong."
"115740052-0-19167";"Hunt. Seek a tribute worthy of your pack. Bring it down, then howl for your brothers and sisters."
"115740052-0-19168";"I'm not sure how to respond to that. Why don't you find out what our vampire vixen is talking about."
"115740052-0-19169";"If the pack accepts you, they will feed, and you will join them. Now, experience my power!"
"115740052-0-19170";"The mad king has fallen! Come, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-19171";"Wow, a real vampire!"
"115740052-0-19172";"I assume I should stop worrying about an ambush."
"115740052-0-19173";"The sooner you begin, the sooner this is over."
"115740052-0-19174";"What am I going to do? I can't do what they … who's there?"
"115740052-0-19175";"Valaste … sorry dear. Say goodbye to the little dreamlings!"
"115740052-0-19177";"The Blacksap are finished! We're at the west bridge. Come, join us!"
"115740052-0-19178";"No need to shout, <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-19179";"So Hircine has sent you to his hunting ground."
"115740052-0-19180";"Yes, ma'am!"
"115740052-0-19181";"Our hero returns! <<1>>, open a portal. <<2>> wants to speak with our friend."
"115740052-0-19182";"If I am to die at your hands, I shall ensure you die by mine."
"115740052-0-19183";"I'll show Hircine who the better hunter is!"
"115740052-0-19184";"I'll take your heart as a prize!"
"115740052-0-19185";"What a magnificent structure! The relic this monolith houses must be powerful indeed!"
"115740052-0-19186";"Not much farther, Leila. Your pain will soon be over."
"115740052-0-19187";"Too many thefts, <<1>>! <<2>> has threatened to call in the Thalmor!"
"115740052-0-19188";"Keep me informed."
"115740052-0-19190";"Enough! The pup has become a wolf."
"115740052-0-19191";"Bow to me, hunter, and receive true power."
"115740052-0-19193";"Sai, it's me! We're seeing some kind of vision of you. Do you know where you are?"
"115740052-0-19194";"I … I don't know. They're torturing me. They … want the Amulet of Kings. Want me to tell them where it's hidden. But I haven't broken. Not yet."
"115740052-0-19195";"We'll find you! Somehow, we'll get you out of there! Sai? Sai! No! Bring him back, you bastards!"
"115740052-0-19196";"My son, you must ensure I am not disturbed. Maintaining the final phase of the Mortuum Vivicus requires all of my concentration!"
"115740052-0-19199";"By the mace of the master!"
"115740052-0-19200";"Fool! You cannot stop the Mortuum Vivicus!"
"115740052-0-19201";"Come out of there! I saw you go down there! Get off my ship before I gut you!"
"115740052-0-19202";"Come here, Adept. I have something for you."
"115740052-0-19203";"How dare you interrupt me?"
"115740052-0-19204";"The tunnel is inside the cove beneath the lighthouse. That key will unlock the trapdoor."
"115740052-0-19205";"Hey, get back over here!"
"115740052-0-19206";"<<1>>, stop your relentless pacing! It's giving me a headache."
"115740052-0-19207";"Bite your tongue, <<1>>. Your lack of commitment is the reason we're here."
"115740052-0-19208";"Halls of the gods or halls of the dead? Which is it? Is there a difference?"
"115740052-0-19209";"My death means nothing! The master will still destroy you!"
"115740052-0-19210";"If you won't stop bickering, I'll gag you both."
"115740052-0-19211";"No! My sacred charge! Your life for the master!"
"115740052-0-19212";"Ah, come in! Good work out there."
"115740052-0-19213";"Over here! By the rocks!"
"115740052-0-19214";"Come on. I'll take you to where the others are waiting."
"115740052-0-19215";"Arkay the Forsaker, we curse you! You left us to suffer in darkness."
"115740052-0-19216";"But we survived. And in darkness we grew."
"115740052-0-19217";"I cannot leave without  <<1>>. Look for me at the central cavern."
"115740052-0-19218";"Now, we feed upon your followers. We will use their stolen strength to conquer and consume you."
"115740052-0-19219";"I told you I would break through the ward. And now, I will break you."
"115740052-0-19220";"Molag Bal, Father of Torment, we curse you! You sought to poison us with your blood."
"115740052-0-19221";"But we survived. And from your poison, we grew."
"115740052-0-19222";"King of Corruption, your children are coming. They will defile and destroy you."
"115740052-0-19223";"I'm not leaving. If I wanted to leave, I would have already done so."
"115740052-0-19224";"Listen up, you bunch of corset-wearing dog-diddlers! We got a new piece of meat on the rack, fresh out of the bowels of Spindleclutch!"
"115740052-0-19225";"What do you say we show 'em a proper welcome to the club?"
"115740052-0-19226";"Hear, hear! I've got a proper welcome for 'em—right down in my breeches!"
"115740052-0-19227";"Tell us you found something, hero. We could use some good news."
"115740052-0-19228";"Might be that's a monster they could actually slay, eh Jalid?"
"115740052-0-19229";"I'm not interested in news. Just tell me you found a way to get us into those tunnels."
"115740052-0-19230";"Always with the breeches. You lot should get out more. Besides, that's no proper welcome. I propose a toast!"
"115740052-0-19231";"Hear, hear! A toast!"
"115740052-0-19232";"A toast and a song!"
"115740052-0-19233";"Hear, hear!"
"115740052-0-19234";"To the new meat's mother. May she have many healthy children—since this one's a goner!"
"115740052-0-19235";"Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-19236";"To the new meat's lover. May their tears be few and silent—so I don't have to hear it when this one dies!"
"115740052-0-19237";"To the new meat's face! May it always bear a smile—so it doesn't look so ugly mounted on a pike!"
"115740052-0-19238";"A fine toast, for a fine piece of meat. Now let's have a song to finish them off!"
"115740052-0-19239";"Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?"
"115740052-0-19240";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19241";"Look! The Amulet! I can see it from here!"
"115740052-0-19242";"Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?"
"115740052-0-19243";"We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19244";"Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?"
"115740052-0-19245";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19246";"I need to let Verandis know what's going on. In the meantime, talk to Skordo. He knows the city like the back of his hand."
"115740052-0-19247";"Hold on. I'm coming with you."
"115740052-0-19248";"Let's check the buildings. There has to be one we can use as a safe location."
"115740052-0-19249";"Children, this is your kin. Life still flows within its blood."
"115740052-0-19250";"Tear it out. Drain it, so that it may join us."
"115740052-0-19251";"Now, you are one of us."
"115740052-0-19252";"I offer you a gift. The catacombs are filled with the Defiler's cultists."
"115740052-0-19253";"Sneak up behind your prey and feast. Relish your new powers. Embrace my blessing."
"115740052-0-19255";"A new face! What's your business?"
"115740052-0-19258";"Bless you! Bless you!"
"115740052-0-19259";"Innkeep Balik lived here. I hope he isn't one of these bloodfiends. Anyway, this place is too small for our needs. Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-19260";"There's little anyone can do for us."
"115740052-0-19261";"These old eyes see you! Come, come!"
"115740052-0-19262";"This is the proudest day of my life, Guildmaster. Thank you."
"115740052-0-19263";"Take care, my friend. The spell key is going to become unstable. The effects may be … explosive."
"115740052-0-19264";"Are you here to help me? Please hurry!"
"115740052-0-19265";"This should do nicely. Let's make sure it's clear."
"115740052-0-19266";"With the disguise, the soldiers won't give you a second glance. But the sentries will certainly stop you if they can."
"115740052-0-19267";"That should do it. We can enter the ruins now."
"115740052-0-19268";"Ellic, where can you be?"
"115740052-0-19270";"Oh, there you are. Have you found anything yet?"
"115740052-0-19271";"Try not to let the bloodfiends suffer when you kill them. They were the citizens of Northpoint once."
"115740052-0-19272";"Gather the others and let's meet at the manor. We have plans to make and I fear our time grows short, the Light preserve us."
"115740052-0-19273";"Have at thee, foul creatures!"
"115740052-0-19274";"Well, that's never happened before. Look out! Behind you!"
"115740052-0-19275";"Finally, the last phrase … hee. The little word buggies go crawling around the page! Squirm, squirm, squirm little buggies!"
"115740052-0-19276";"Damn the Mad God. Damn Ulfsild! Damn the lot of them!"
"115740052-0-19277";"They'll see … they'll all see. Archmage Shalidor's name will ring across history!"
"115740052-0-19278";"Watch out, they're coming out of the woodwork!"
"115740052-0-19279";"I lost track of the Baron and the Countess when I heard the innkeeper scream. But I was too late."
"115740052-0-19280";"He gave me the key to the inn before he died. I think he tried to tell me something, but I couldn't make it out. Be on your guard. Here comes more of those monsters."
"115740052-0-19281";"Thanks for rescuing me. Just so you know, this isn't a usual occurrence. Oh, who am I kidding? This happens to me all the time."
"115740052-0-19282";"Can I assume the house you emerged from is our safe location? Of course it is. I'll just wander over and have a little lie down, if it's all the same with you."
"115740052-0-19283";"Damn it, Countess! That stings! Stop smearing me with your religious ointments and creams!"
"115740052-0-19284";"Lleraya has been here all along? And your son didn't do a damn thing about it?"
"115740052-0-19285";"According to Ellic's journal, yes. He seems to have been infatuated with the woman. Didn't even get alarmed when she started turning people into bloodfiends."
"115740052-0-19286";"Gah! What is that stuff? It smells like church! Keep it away from me!"
"115740052-0-19287";"More bloodfiends? I hate this. Just give me something to hit already! But it does sound like your son betrayed Northpoint, Baron."
"115740052-0-19288";"It's the Remnant. It put Ellic under her spell. I'm surprised he was even able to write in his journal. Maybe that was his way of warning us."
"115740052-0-19289";"I'm going with you to check on the inn. Skordo, when we give the signal, call in the army."
"115740052-0-19290";"Head to the inn. I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-19291";"My people … a ruler shouldn't have to cut down his own people like this …."
"115740052-0-19292";"Commander Attius is down the hall. He tortured us. He needs to pay."
"115740052-0-19293";"One favor I ask: if you see Commander Attius, kill him."
"115740052-0-19294";"The garrison is ours! You imbeciles will soon witness the Empire's true strength!"
"115740052-0-19295";"Comrade, over here!"
"115740052-0-19296";"Let's check upstairs. Someone must have survived this nightmare."
"115740052-0-19297";"Worm! You accomplish nothing. I remove the Vivicus to Coldharbour. This doom will come again to Tamriel."
"115740052-0-19298";"It's good to see you're still alive, my old friend!"
"115740052-0-19299";"It's up to you, <<1>>. You bear the Prismatic Weapon, and the hopes of everyone in Delodiil."
"115740052-0-19300";"In fact, let's sweeten the deal. You decide she stays, I'll cure her! That's right! Uncle Sheo will make her sane again. Boring old Valaste, whose only friends are books!"
"115740052-0-19301";"Now that I know my people are safe and hidden, it is time to order the army to attack. Stop Lleraya if you can, but save my son. I want him alive to answer for his crimes."
"115740052-0-19302";"And if the adept decides she goes with you?"
"115740052-0-19303";"Stop following me."
"115740052-0-19304";"Well, as it happens I have one more book here. I'd give it to you in exchange for Valaste. It's called … the Folium Discognitum."
"115740052-0-19305";"Wrote it myself, it's a delightful little artifact. It imbues the reader with the knowledge of madmen! It's very powerful … worth oh, four or five of those Skyshard things you adventurers are always looking for."
"115740052-0-19306";"So! Valaste stays and I cure her. Or … she goes with me and you, my little mortal, become much more powerful. Your choice!"
"115740052-0-19307";"Sheogorath, you bastard! You'd throw the Folium back in my face, after all these years?"
"115740052-0-19308";"An intruder? So you're the one who's been undoing our work. We will feed you to the Master's Mace."
"115740052-0-19310";"Here we go!"
"115740052-0-19311";"Look! It's working! I can't believe it!"
"115740052-0-19312";"Ayrenn, there's always time to protect you from yourself."
"115740052-0-19313";"When you wear <<1>>, you'll never be held in place!"
"115740052-0-19314";"A trophy catch. I'll enjoy gutting you!"
"115740052-0-19315";"Who dares interfere with my hunt?"
"115740052-0-19316";"What's this? A worthy speciman for my collection."
"115740052-0-19317";"Ah, all the nobles have gathered! What an excellent party!"
"115740052-0-19318";"Someone new? How exciting! Come up, come up! You must introduce yourself before you can join the festivities."
"115740052-0-19319";"Another head for Hircine."
"115740052-0-19320";"No, I'm saying you can't really know how we feel. Your home was never invaded."
"115740052-0-19321";"And I'm saying the Dunmer have been enslaving my people for centuries. How does that make me unequipped to understand you?"
"115740052-0-19322";"It's not even the same! It's completely different, how do you not see that?"
"115740052-0-19323";"The Prince of Madness doesn't stay where he's not wanted … heh, except when he does. But in this case, he doesn't! Until next time, Magelings!"
"115740052-0-19324";"No! You tricked me, sister! It's your fault!"
"115740052-0-19326";"Friends, fellow nobles, the glorious blessing of Lady Lleraya is almost upon us! Let us prepare ourselves to bask in her presence."
"115740052-0-19327";"Hold still just a moment, comrade."
"115740052-0-19328";"You might as well come up. I know that you're here."
"115740052-0-19329";"I can take your pain away. I can make you feel so much better."
"115740052-0-19330";"Well, well, well. You're not at all what I was expecting. That makes this so much more exciting."
"115740052-0-19331";"You need to resist her, my friend."
"115740052-0-19332";"I must not delay."
"115740052-0-19333";"You must break free of her spell before all is lost!"
"115740052-0-19334";"Just as in Lorkrata, Lleraya has cast a veil. It hides her. Protects her. You must find a way to enter the illusion. The basement! I can feel slight imperfections in the spell down there."
"115740052-0-19335";"There I am … still dead. So do I just climb back in …?"
"115740052-0-19336";"There. Easier than I thought. That knife wound still smarts, but it's good to be alive."
"115740052-0-19337";"You there! Stranger! Why are you here?"
"115740052-0-19338";"All right everyone. This is it. No one is allowed to die until they've taken down at least a dozen enemies. Kill as many as you can. The only exception is the Magus-General—she's mine, and mine alone."
"115740052-0-19339";"Good speech, Emeric. I can't believe you still fancy me after all these years. Let's get reacquainted then, shall we?"
"115740052-0-19340";"To arms! Defend the King!"
"115740052-0-19341";"You will not!"
"115740052-0-19342";"Overconfident as ever, I see! I'm not afraid of you, Septima …."
"115740052-0-19343";"I think we need to spend some alone time, Emeric. Come, let's find a quiet place …."
"115740052-0-19344";"<<1>> and <<2>> will hold the door from this side. Valasha and I from the other. May the Sunburst guide your sword-arm, my friend."
"115740052-0-19345";"Vermin, all of you! I'll kill you all!"
"115740052-0-19346";"Welcome, my pets! Soon I shall bestow upon you my blessing. Then you will be able to truly take your place by my side."
"115740052-0-19347";"I ask only one small, insignificant thing from you. One tiny favor. You must all give yourselves—totally and completely—to me."
"115740052-0-19348";"Northpoint has given so much to me already. So many devoted worshipers. So much blood. Soon, all of Rivenspire will do the same. And then all the lands beyond!"
"115740052-0-19349";"The veil is a powerful illusion. But just as at Lorkrata, you can manipulate its power using a tear. You have entered the veil. Now find Lleraya and finish this."
"115740052-0-19350";"As usual, Verandis once again ruins my fun. I guess I'll just have to destroy you now. Pity, but I can always get another pet."
"115740052-0-19351";"Poor Lleraya. I never wanted it to come to this."
"115740052-0-19352";"foo"
"115740052-0-19353";"zod"
"115740052-0-19354";"What do you think you're doing?"
"115740052-0-19356";"Where is the guard? And what are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-19357";"I will take that as a compliment, Rulanir. But look around. Look what he helped me to build. The Agea Relle and its students are more beautiful than I ever dreamed. How can you doubt his character?"
"115740052-0-19358";"That is not a reason to love someone."
"115740052-0-19359";"He was my husband before we built the school, Rulanir. And it's not like you haven't gained from his work. Being our blademaster is the first steady job you've held since the Fighters Guild kicked you out."
"115740052-0-19360";"I'll be back on the roads of Tamriel soon enough. And maybe you'll come to your senses and adventure with me, again."
"115740052-0-19361";"Keep dreaming, Rulanir. This school is the world to me, now."
"115740052-0-19362";"Ah! Look Emeric, your savior has arrived! Or is that your executioner?"
"115740052-0-19363";"Silence, creature!"
"115740052-0-19364";"Adeena's the one possessed. The Daedra is trying to trick you. Don't believe its lies."
"115740052-0-19365";"No. You must believe me. You can't let it finish the ritual. You can't!"
"115740052-0-19366";"So long as that thing lives, so does the ritual. You have to kill it to end this!"
"115740052-0-19367";"Auggh!"
"115740052-0-19368";"Please! Listen to me! If the ritual completes, who knows how many innocent lives may be lost."
"115740052-0-19369";"<<1>>, what happened to you? You are in a terrible state."
"115740052-0-19370";"Are you aware of the danger I was in?"
"115740052-0-19371";"But where is your pack? And where is <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-19372";"<<1>>! <<1>>? I've been wasting away like a common beggar, and you ask after the monkey?"
"115740052-0-19373";"I must ensure he does not lose his way again."
"115740052-0-19374";"I suppose I must say goodbye, my friend. I'll see you on the other side …."
"115740052-0-19375";"To come so far and fail. I know it burns. He's dead though, and the Covenant will be too. Unless you think you can pull him back from the afterlife …. Ha!"
"115740052-0-19376";"I shall write about how awful you are as a guide!"
"115740052-0-19377";"Hold your tongue, High Elf! King Camoran didn't need Queen Ayrenn's help—never asked for it, in fact!"
"115740052-0-19378";"Why is that humorous?"
"115740052-0-19380";"You're here too? Can you get us back? It's quite pleasant here, but I'm not ready to die yet! We can't let them win!"
"115740052-0-19381";"No reason in particular."
"115740052-0-19382";"If Queen Ayrenn hadn't saved your hides at Cormount, you would have lost the civil war. You lot owe your lives and your allegience to the Altmer."
"115740052-0-19383";"You haughty High Elf bastard! The Wood Elves don't owe allegiance to anyone. Least of all finely-bred fools such as yourself!"
"115740052-0-19384";"What do you think, traveler? I can't speak to this High Elf bastard any longer. He's so well-educated and wise that he can barely function."
"115740052-0-19385";"Tell me, does the goddess also see her own doom? I reserve a special place for her glorious soul!"
"115740052-0-19386";"Enjoy your victory while it lasts. I will return, again and again, until all bow before me."
"115740052-0-19387";"Hush now, Emeric. Your death matters little—there are other kings. It's this one I wanted. The one who's been holding the Covenant together at every turn. The vestige from Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-19388";"Didn't think I knew, did you? I did, and I knew I couldn't kill you  … on Mundus. Here though, you're severed from Coldharbour, from your soul. Here, you're stuck. Goodbye now."
"115740052-0-19389";"Insolent necromancer! The Far Shores is no prison in which you can place your enemies! You dare to come here and then expect to leave freely? I think not."
"115740052-0-19390";"You though, are no less a fool. An honorable fool, but a fool nonetheless. Hm. Very well, though. I have an offer: slay this wretched woman and you and your liege can return to the Mundus."
"115740052-0-19391";"I'll leave whenever I damn well please … but I'll enjoy teaching you both a lesson in power first."
"115740052-0-19392";"Lashgikh, I hear your oath. Osgrikh the Minor turned my Oathbound against you—one of my own."
"115740052-0-19393";"Malacath, God of Curses, I appeal to you in my rage!"
"115740052-0-19394";"And you seek justice for this? Good. Then your anger is my anger."
"115740052-0-19395";"Ah, bravo, mortal! Your powers of perception are strong indeed! Unfortunately, twins share the same blood! How vexing! Pity I didn't think of it sooner, it might have saved us all a great deal of talking."
"115740052-0-19396";"The ritual is complete! And my first act will be to reclaim my body and destroy you!"
"115740052-0-19398";"My better half lies dead. My blood burns. My blade hungers."
"115740052-0-19399";"It was your Queen's duty to protect us, High Elf! All of us. It doesn't mean your people can lord over the Bosmer."
"115740052-0-19400";"If that's what you want to believe, Wood Elf …."
"115740052-0-19401";"Shut your mouth, Faindor! You're a horrible youth!"
"115740052-0-19402";"You need to learn your place, Wood Elf. It's below my foot."
"115740052-0-19403";"Your people are oppressors disguised as our protectors! We don't need you—or your military!"
"115740052-0-19404";"Finally, this one gets some attention!"
"115740052-0-19405";"You'll start a riot, you fool! This isn't the way!"
"115740052-0-19406";"You! Stop that at once!"
"115740052-0-19407";"Quickly now … I don't know how long we'll have this privacy."
"115740052-0-19408";"How dare you go through my things!"
"115740052-0-19409";"Something's happening! I think it's working!"
"115740052-0-19410";"No! Let me go!"
"115740052-0-19411";"I've seen the girl. It's not too late."
"115740052-0-19412";"You there, explain yourself! What are you doing in my home?"
"115740052-0-19413";"It's the Smelly Room. That <<z:1>> lit the hallways when <<2>> carried it back from the Constellation Room."
"115740052-0-19414";"Papa!"
"115740052-0-19415";"Behold … the Forbidden Room! I come here to think sometimes. It's where <<1>> left the book she wrote in when she put <<2>> to sleep."
"115740052-0-19416";"I don't like the Moaning Room. All the servants used to live in the cages. But <<1>> brought that <<z:2>> back here, I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-19417";"Hazzi! I am where the birds roost! Come!"
"115740052-0-19418";"You are mistaken, friend."
"115740052-0-19419";"Master Ufa! You're truly alive!"
"115740052-0-19420";"Did I not send word with our friend here?"
"115740052-0-19421";"You have little choice, Niha."
"115740052-0-19422";"Ufa! You're alive?"
"115740052-0-19423";"Wait here."
"115740052-0-19424";"I've brought you refreshment, sir."
"115740052-0-19425";"Niha! Always so good to me. Let's taste this fine concoction!"
"115740052-0-19426";"A strange … flavor. What kind of … wine?"
"115740052-0-19427";"Whoa, there! Are you all right? I heard fighting."
"115740052-0-19428";"Bleating like a cut lamb, I see."
"115740052-0-19429";"Ufa! I thought you were dead!"
"115740052-0-19430";"That was the intent. Get the key off his body and leave him."
"115740052-0-19431";"Good, I'm free. Let the people know the time has come."
"115740052-0-19432";"Light the two watchtowers. We must rise up against the Imperials!"
"115740052-0-19433";"We … must not falter. Go! Light them!"
"115740052-0-19434";"<<1>>, our friend needs your help in the Hall of Might."
"115740052-0-19435";"The Hall of Might! So you think we've found it? Exhilarating!"
"115740052-0-19436";"Lead away, my friend!"
"115740052-0-19437";"Have you no respect for the dead?"
"115740052-0-19438";"Can you see anything up there?"
"115740052-0-19442";"I hear familiar footfalls. Come closer, Vestige."
"115740052-0-19443";"They were quite terrifying, even when projecting my construct in their midst."
"115740052-0-19445";"Oh, what an unfortunate miscalculation! Five innocent deaths on your head in as many minutes …. I do hope you remember to say your prayers tonight!"
"115740052-0-19446";"Hey! How about some help, here?"
"115740052-0-19447";"First those nobles and now you cretins? You don't belong here!"
"115740052-0-19448";"What in Oblivion? Lashgikh! I'll crush you all!"
"115740052-0-19449";"What? Could that filth spirit away all of Falinesti?"
"115740052-0-19450";"Ha! Here we are. One flawed Akaviri depiction of my people."
"115740052-0-19451";"I hope you find it as amusing as I did."
"115740052-0-19452";"Well now. I didn't expect to see you here."
"115740052-0-19453";"You're not who I was expecting."
"115740052-0-19454";"Oh, I'll handle that. I do love playing with locks."
"115740052-0-19455";"See you below."
"115740052-0-19456";"Why don't you let me open that … quietly."
"115740052-0-19457";"Do try and keep up."
"115740052-0-19458";"Izzara? Praise Ruptga, it is good to see you safe. Where's Adeena?"
"115740052-0-19459";"Najan, you cowardly snake. She's dead! Slain by that monster you lusted after!"
"115740052-0-19460";"No, no that can't be true! You were supposed to save her!"
"115740052-0-19461";"And what about you? Could you not have saved her? No, you were busy out here cowering behind rocks like a dog!"
"115740052-0-19462";"After all she did for you … all she sacrificed, you cast her into Oblivion for a fool's pleasure. You disgust me!"
"115740052-0-19463";"Izzara! I … I didn't know! If —"
"115740052-0-19464";"My sister deserved better than you. A better life than you."
"115740052-0-19465";"If I ever see you again …. There aren't words for what I'll do to you."
"115740052-0-19466";"Adeena? Oh Adeena, my love! Thank the Eight you're safe!"
"115740052-0-19467";"Hold your miserable tongue, snake! I'll not hear more of your lies!"
"115740052-0-19468";"Adeena, it was all my fault, I know …. Zeht's tears, I'm so sorry! I didn't know! I didn't —"
"115740052-0-19469";"You lusted after a Daedra, you filthy cur! A Daedra! After all I've done—all I've sacrificed! For you!"
"115740052-0-19470";"I know. I know I failed you … failed us. But if you'd only —"
"115740052-0-19471";"No, Najan! I will not. Perhaps if you'd come and faced the monster yourself. But instead you send my sister? Izzara is dead because of you!"
"115740052-0-19472";"Alwe! Moon-sugar is a spice, used in many Khajiiti dishes. Calling it cat drugs is demeaning to me and my people."
"115740052-0-19473";"Dead? By the Eight …. Adeena, I'm sorry … I'm so sorry. Adeena? Please speak to me!"
"115740052-0-19474";"I may have spoken harshly, but moon-sugar is dangerous! It's used to make skooma—as your people know very well—and therefore, it's a drug. If skooma is illegal, moon-sugar should also be."
"115740052-0-19475";"Preposterous! That's like saying we should stop growing golden pears because they are used to make ale. You Elves are too much for me sometimes—always losing sight of the forest for the trees!"
"115740052-0-19476";"Over here! There's a draft coming from this book case!"
"115740052-0-19477";"Well, what do you think? Yes, you there. What are your thoughts on this?"
"115740052-0-19478";"Hear that, High Elf? The traveler agrees with me! Your people are haughty and oppressive!"
"115740052-0-19479";"I miss Khenarthi, where my people aren't judged for being who they are."
"115740052-0-19480";"I can't believe you drug-addled cats were allowed to join the Dominion."
"115740052-0-19481";"You see, cat? Everyone agrees. Your mind is too clouded from the moon-sugar to understand that you're wrong."
"115740052-0-19482";"Captain! What happened?"
"115740052-0-19483";"You're not fine! Who did this to you? I'll kill them!"
"115740052-0-19484";"Fine. Drink this. Now."
"115740052-0-19485";"Easy, Nicolene. I'm fine."
"115740052-0-19486";"Get me a healing potion, and we'll kill them together."
"115740052-0-19487";"Oh. Much better."
"115740052-0-19488";"Anexiel? Is that you? Oh, beloved Ruptga help me, it can't be!"
"115740052-0-19489";"And now, I'd like to present the secret history of the Red Pact."
"115740052-0-19490";"We'll see what <<1>> thinks of your impertinent questions."
"115740052-0-19491";"Every Wood Elf knows of the Green Pact made with Y'ffre. None may harm the forest, or use its bounty for personal gain. Only meat may be consumed to survive."
"115740052-0-19492";"He's down here. Be ready for a fight."
"115740052-0-19493";"We're with you, Captain!"
"115740052-0-19494";"I need to stop being a hero."
"115740052-0-19495";"This isn't going to be remotely fun."
"115740052-0-19496";"This performance is dedicated to someone in the crowd who helped the show go on. I don't want to embarrass them, but they know who they are."
"115740052-0-19497";"Naruk's already left! You'll never catch him!"
"115740052-0-19499";"You've ruined everything. You'll die here."
"115740052-0-19500";"Lock the cistern gates! We'll keep them off the winch!"
"115740052-0-19501";"Another thread cut, yet the loom spins on."
"115740052-0-19502";"Watch your back, Nicolene!"
"115740052-0-19503";"After we murder these sons of dogs, drinks are on me!"
"115740052-0-19504";"And now you think yourself free of the web. What a delightful fiction …."
"115740052-0-19505";"Don't get cocky!"
"115740052-0-19506";"Well done! Now destroy the poison barrels!"
"115740052-0-19507";"Naruk can't be far! Go after him! We'll stop the poison!"
"115740052-0-19508";"I am! I'm also watching yours!"
"115740052-0-19509";"I got one!"
"115740052-0-19510";"Well, don't get dead!"
"115740052-0-19511";"I got blood in my hair! I hate that!"
"115740052-0-19512";"Poison us? I'll gut you, dog!"
"115740052-0-19513";"Why do they always run?"
"115740052-0-19514";"Wait. What? No, my lord! I served you faithfully!"
"115740052-0-19515";"Oh no! Master, please! Spare me!"
"115740052-0-19516";"You've done it!"
"115740052-0-19517";"<<AC:1>>!"
"115740052-0-19518";"I never thought I'd hold it …."
"115740052-0-19519";"… in my own two hands! Well, puppet hands count as my hands."
"115740052-0-19520";"The power … it's exquisite! And I have you to thank!"
"115740052-0-19521";"And now, I really must take this <<1>> puppet for a stroll."
"115740052-0-19522";"Let's see how fast it can run!"
"115740052-0-19523";"My minions will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-19524";"The faithful of Abagarlas serve beyond death!"
"115740052-0-19525";"No! I return to you, my king! My Anumaril."
"115740052-0-19526";"Help me … destroy … the crystal …."
"115740052-0-19527";"That is not the blade a true sword-singer would wield. Try again."
"115740052-0-19528";"Elden Root! First and last of the Graht-oaks."
"115740052-0-19529";"I don't have time for this."
"115740052-0-19530";"This really is too easy."
"115740052-0-19531";"<<1>>! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-19532";"Here is the temple of the Eight. We accept the Eight just as you do. Possibly more."
"115740052-0-19533";"Here you can get a view of majestic Elden Root in all its splendor."
"115740052-0-19534";"Here you can see the ruins of Laeloria. They say golden wisps congregate there at night."
"115740052-0-19535";"I'm <<1>>, a bug wrangler. What does that mean? Perhaps my little friends here can show you. Now … defend the perimeter!"
"115740052-0-19536";"Be sure to stay near, and don't leave the road. The wilds can be a dangerous place."
"115740052-0-19537";"Return to positions!"
"115740052-0-19538";"We had words. He's threatened me."
"115740052-0-19539";"I'm … sure it's just a misunderstanding. I'll speak to him."
"115740052-0-19540";"Please do. War wizards don't take well to threats. I'm here because you've asked me to be—if he wants me gone …."
"115740052-0-19541";"You're the most well-regarded Destruction specialist in the field, my friend. I'm sure Nerien'eth wants you here as much as I do."
"115740052-0-19542";"We'll have your soul, as well!"
"115740052-0-19543";"Vile seductress! You have earned your place here!"
"115740052-0-19544";"Septima Tharn. A grand niece on my mother's side. Or was it a third cousin? No matter. From what I've heard of her predilections, she belongs in this gallery of horrors."
"115740052-0-19545";"It's my small-minded nephew, Javad. The lad was petty and cruel for the enjoyment of it. I always suspected he'd meet an untimely end. Leave him to his fate. It's kinder than he deserves."
"115740052-0-19552";"My cousin … my king … I'm sorry we failed you."
"115740052-0-19553";"Emeric! You are … you are alive?"
"115740052-0-19554";"Hello! This one needs to go to a safe place away from vampire skeevers."
"115740052-0-19555";"It works! This one feels it! To Reaper's March, this one goes!"
"115740052-0-19556";"<<1>>! Verdant capital of the Camoran dynasty!"
"115740052-0-19557";"Here, you can see our Khajiiti allies! Fastened beneath <<1>> tighter than a Hoarvor in the Strid."
"115740052-0-19558";"Behold—another blight upon what was once unbroken green."
"115740052-0-19559";"This is Haven. A prime piece of coastline the Altmer so graciously liberated from the forest. To share, they say, their immense wisdom with their poor, leaf-wearing cousins."
"115740052-0-19560";"Tread carefully, friends. Wouldn't want the forest to swallow you up!"
"115740052-0-19561";"Let's keep going."
"115740052-0-19562";"Come along!"
"115740052-0-19563";"That's enough for today. Let's return to Elden Root. I'm sure the humidity is getting to some of you."
"115740052-0-19564";"Don't lie, cat man! I saw you eat that flower! I can't let you harm this forest without penance! The Green Pact demands that you pay for your indiscretions!"
"115740052-0-19565";"But this Khajiit loves to eat flowers! You're insane! Put that axe away! I have done nothing wrong!"
"115740052-0-19566";"The plants and the trees are sacred to the Bosmer—all true Bosmer, at any rate. I demand retribution for the flower you slaughtered and devoured!"
"115740052-0-19567";"Someone help! You there! Please, talk some sense into that Elf! He's a lunatic!"
"115740052-0-19568";"That'll show you! Ha! Did you see his face?"
"115740052-0-19569";"Now hear this, cat! I'll give you a running start, and then I'll collect your fool head!"
"115740052-0-19570";"By the Mane, you're a monster!"
"115740052-0-19571";"Sorry, cat. I let my anger get to me."
"115740052-0-19572";"I understand. One time my brother, under the influence of skooma, also attacked me. Luckily, he could not climb trees in that state, though it was humorous to see him try."
"115740052-0-19573";"Where is that ugly thing? It should be here!"
"115740052-0-19574";"You again?"
"115740052-0-19575";"You think me defeated so easily?"
"115740052-0-19576";"You'll have to try harder than that!"
"115740052-0-19577";"… and with one final shift …."
"115740052-0-19578";"Yes, it's working! I can feel it!"
"115740052-0-19579";"Anexiel … please, I beg you for Morwha's mercy. Release my sister."
"115740052-0-19580";"Do you feel that?"
"115740052-0-19581";"The others are returning!"
"115740052-0-19582";"I don't know where you found your new friends, Alanwe, but they don't seem to fear death. It's admirable."
"115740052-0-19583";"They can speak to that better than I, but they've bested my husband's minions. We owe them everything."
"115740052-0-19584";"Indeed."
"115740052-0-19585";"You will have to take your compatriots and remove yourself from the embassy grounds. You're disrupting our duties here."
"115740052-0-19586";"This one is not leaving until Khajiiti interests are represented here. Where is our embassy? Where is our voice in proceedings?"
"115740052-0-19587";"You don't understand. Your presence here is disrupting our efforts to do just that. Please, take your friends and go."
"115740052-0-19588";"Not until our voices are heard."
"115740052-0-19589";"Sadas! The people of Hallin's Stand demand your surrender!"
"115740052-0-19590";"If you won't surrender, your life is … forfeit!"
"115740052-0-19591";"Proud people of Hallin's Stand, we have won the day!"
"115740052-0-19592";"A stranger to our city was the spark. Let us never forget this, or those who fell in the fight!"
"115740052-0-19593";"I won't fail you again, Secundus!"
"115740052-0-19594";"I'll make you an example to these dogs!"
"115740052-0-19595";"I can't believe this! You're just going to lie down and take a nap …?"
"115740052-0-19596";"Fortunately, you won't have to."
"115740052-0-19597";"Here, again? I mean … yes, mortal?"
"115740052-0-19598";"Emeric … I mean, Your Majesty! Thank the gods!"
"115740052-0-19599";"By the Empyrean Light—I didn't know Nerien'eth had tortured so many of us. That whoreson dog!"
"115740052-0-19600";"Oh, yes …. Come meet your sweet demise, mortal."
"115740052-0-19601";"Easy, Faindor. He'll pay when the time comes, but we don't want you rushing off to die. Again."
"115740052-0-19602";"Lie still, my sweet. It will all be over soon …."
"115740052-0-19603";"Our friends killed his Daedric pets. He may come looking for us, and we need to be ready."
"115740052-0-19604";"If you don't get back here, I'm going to do this without you!"
"115740052-0-19606";"Grant me vengeance. Grant me justice. For the honor of my love lost."
"115740052-0-19607";"Grant me Osgrikh and I will grant you his head in your name."
"115740052-0-19608";"Osgrikh the Coward flies from your fury—from your champion. I will not have your rage denied! Prepare yourself and prepare your champion. Osgrikh comes to you."
"115740052-0-19609";"Through here, everyone! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-19610";"Good work, Zungarg. As a reward, I will permit you to join me in my feast."
"115740052-0-19611";"Zungarg! It's as I feared. He's turned. You'll pay for this, vampire scum!"
"115740052-0-19612";"Oh, please."
"115740052-0-19613";"So this pile of moss and rubble determines the next emperor."
"115740052-0-19614";"<<1>> is ancient. Show some respect."
"115740052-0-19615";"It's magnificent."
"115740052-0-19616";"Nearly there, your majesties, Your Highness!"
"115740052-0-19617";"And now the Ayleid deathtrap will tell us if we have an emperor in our midst. Truly, a momentous day."
"115740052-0-19618";"Naemon, now is not the time."
"115740052-0-19619";"Osgrikh lies slain. The oath is fulfilled. Your champion fought well, child."
"115740052-0-19620";"Rise, blood of my blood. I have helped you restore your honor. But others will come for you. Show them—show me—that your rage is fiercer."
"115740052-0-19621";"Shard of Aetherius, fall upon us now and anoint us with your blessing."
"115740052-0-19622";"It's done, friend. We should talk."
"115740052-0-19623";"It's working! It's actually working!"
"115740052-0-19624";"Good luck, walker. Maybe I'll see you around."
"115740052-0-19625";"Not bad—for a bunch of drunken slobs. Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-19626";"Hope you enjoyed the show, friend. We do take pride in what we are. Now you can, too."
"115740052-0-19627";"Hey Champion! Yeah, I'm talking to you!"
"115740052-0-19628";"I lost a bunch of coin betting against you!"
"115740052-0-19629";"I ever find you in a dark alley, and I'm getting my coins back!"
"115740052-0-19630";"My friend, do you see that striking walker over there? That … that is the Champion. The one that took down Ishalga."
"115740052-0-19631";"No, it's true. This one won many coins that day. Most impressive."
"115740052-0-19632";"You don't say? That one doesn't look all that tough."
"115740052-0-19633";"I guess looks can be decieving. Never would have guessed."
"115740052-0-19634";"You can't be serious! How can we possibly trust him?"
"115740052-0-19635";"As our visitor so eloquently pointed out, we cannot. But if we are to locate Sai Sahan, we must do this. Go with the Vestige, Lyris. Rescue Tharn. Give him the chance to redeem himself. He may surprise you."
"115740052-0-19636";"No! Esmaeel! Is he …?"
"115740052-0-19637";"Why am I not surprised to find Cadwell here? He certainly does get around."
"115740052-0-19638";"You've doomed yourself by coming here—you know that, don't you?"
"115740052-0-19639";"You were a fool to come back, Lashgikh!"
"115740052-0-19640";"Lashgikh! I'll make gloves from your skin!"
"115740052-0-19641";"The head of Thrug. He brought it on himself. Let's go."
"115740052-0-19642";"Larzgug's cruelty often outstripped that of her brothers. It was the only way to gain recognition in her family."
"115740052-0-19643";"Begone, insufferable Worms! I'm working as fast as I can!"
"115740052-0-19644";"We've got everything we need for the ritual. Come, friend. Let's have a word."
"115740052-0-19645";"I'm shocked your lack of education and repeated blows to the head haven't dulled your wit, Titanborn."
"115740052-0-19646";"This might be what we're looking for! Come to me!"
"115740052-0-19647";"The portal transfer is complete."
"115740052-0-19648";"Good, it's who we've been expecting. You're in no danger here, friend. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-19649";"I can, and I shall! Where is the Amulet of Kings?"
"115740052-0-19650";"Clear your mind and study the scrolls. The answer will become apparent."
"115740052-0-19651";"Very well. You have my blessing. Now you must seek my son's spirit. Speak to Divad."
"115740052-0-19652";"Thank you for honoring my mother's memory. You have my blessing. Now you must seek out Makela Leki."
"115740052-0-19653";"I'll figure something out. I always do."
"115740052-0-19654";"I don't take kindly to people snooping around my dice game. Nothing personal, but you'll have to die!"
"115740052-0-19655";"Get this fool, my darlings!"
"115740052-0-19656";"Be quiet! We're being watched."
"115740052-0-19657";"Oh gods! You're ruthless! Please … no more! You're really scaring me now! I'm going back to Arnitole!"
"115740052-0-19658";"I'll begin the ritual."
"115740052-0-19659";"You seek to enter the Vaults? All those within would pay dearly to leave it!"
"115740052-0-19660";"<<1>> will see our plight and understand, as a fellow of noble birth and bearing. He must! It's his … his noble duty."
"115740052-0-19661";"Father, there's no such obligation. We aren't his bannermen. By the Divines, we're from Wayrest! What reason could he possibly have to help us? And what help are you expecting, anyway?"
"115740052-0-19662";"Where is the downside for him? Through granting us an army, he sees a new and permanent ally in High Rock. And we retake our holdings, reestablish our standing. It's a good deal for us all, you see?"
"115740052-0-19663";"Father, do you realize how this sounds? What happens when your wish isn't granted? You should really step back and look at yourself."
"115740052-0-19664";"Well … as you can probably guess, father was laughed out of court. I don't really know what he expected, making demands of <<1>> like that."
"115740052-0-19665";"I expected as much. I don't know what more I could've done, beyond physically restraining him. And I'm not about to tie my father down."
"115740052-0-19666";"I don't know what we should do now. I heard there's a settlement of Colovian descent somewhere called <<1>>. We could go there. I mean, if we're no longer welcome here, that is."
"115740052-0-19667";"No. No, from what I've heard, we absolutely do not want to go to <<1>>. Better for us to just stay here. Maybe find work as mercenaries."
"115740052-0-19669";"Gasteau—you look good, considering. It's been ages."
"115740052-0-19670";"It has been. Are you well?"
"115740052-0-19671";"Hardly. I think we've made a mistake."
"115740052-0-19672";"I regret nothing—look at what Dutheil's become."
"115740052-0-19673";"We've created a monster. All these souls he tortures for the Daedra."
"115740052-0-19674";"Don't ever—Dutheil, the Mad Architect, did this. Not us."
"115740052-0-19675";"<Blood-curdling scream. This text should not be played.>"
"115740052-0-19676";"I hope you're not skittish about heights. That's a long drop."
"115740052-0-19677";"<Blood-curdling scream. This text should not be played.>"
"115740052-0-19678";"This one notices the plans will be placing the Khajiit Embassy where our camp presently is, yes? This is a good place, <<1>> is thinking."
"115740052-0-19679";"A good place for travelling Khajiit to rest or chat, and its close proximity to the Elden Tree makes trade convenient. It's good for everyone, really."
"115740052-0-19680";"<<1>> knows that we cannot cut wood of the trees of <<2>>. We could import the wood, from <<3>>, perhaps?"
"115740052-0-19681";"As you wish. Sai Sahan has something he wanted to ask you as well. You should go to him."
"115740052-0-19682";"But few Wood Elves know of the deal struck before … some say with Molag Bal himself!"
"115740052-0-19683";"Indeed, the Red Pact forbade the consumption of meat. It mandated the trees be cut down for homes, and fruit and vegetables alone sustain the Wood Elf people."
"115740052-0-19684";"Shocking, I know! But Molag Bal wished to keep the Wood Elves weak and sickly, by making them eat the very forest around them."
"115740052-0-19685";"Such is what the God of Schemes planned … a slow death brought to the heart of Y'ffre's power."
"115740052-0-19686";"But the God of the Forest was no fool. Approaching the dwindling, sickly Wood Elves and noting their grass-stained teeth, Y'ffre offered them a deal."
"115740052-0-19687";"They would make a new deal, a fresh Green Pact, and the forest itself would always defend them."
"115740052-0-19688";"And so the Wood Elves accepted Y'ffre's offer. The Meat Mandate defied Molag Bal's Red Pact, as did the bone and leather used to build their homes."
"115740052-0-19689";"Molag Bal's rage was great. He would repay the breaking of the Red Pact with the devouring of <<1>> …."
"115740052-0-19690";"Everyone knows the tale of <<1>>, how Molag Bal devoured an entire Wood Elf city."
"115740052-0-19691";"But few know it was <<c:1>> who kept the God of Schemes from eating all of the Valenwood!"
"115740052-0-19692";"For <<c:1>> knew Molag Bal had a single weakness … the thrum of a perfectly tuned lute."
"115740052-0-19693";"So he called upon the greatest lute-player in the Valenwood to send the Daedric Prince back to <<1>>."
"115740052-0-19694";"And so Emerald Spinner Agon strode into the ruins of <<1>>, ivory lute slung across his shoulders like a Nord's greatsword."
"115740052-0-19695";"As the first strum rolled through the blasted town, the God of Schemes stayed his wire-wrapped fist from impaling its last dozen inhabitants."
"115740052-0-19696";"The second strum drew the Father of Vampires from the ravaged town. He loomed over Agon with rapt attention."
"115740052-0-19697";"But the final strum drew forth a single tear from the Lord of Brutality's eye. ""Today you share the one beauty I cannot destroy,"" he whispered."
"115740052-0-19698";"We'll never know Agon's response, for the Daedric Prince's tear fell upon him and dissolved him in an instant. Only after Molag Bal's departure could <<c:1>> gather his remains."
"115740052-0-19699";"Emerald Spinner Agon and his ivory lute were buried beneath the first graht-oak planted by the great King Eplear, founder of the Camoran throne …."
"115740052-0-19700";"I'm certain everyone here knows of the great Eplear. First king of the Valenwood, founder of the Camoran dynasty … this tale is familiar to us all."
"115740052-0-19701";"Yet the tale of King Eplear's ascension is rarely told. His life began as a simple ox-herd on the plains of Valen. You heard me, the plains! For back then, Tamriel was an endless sea of grass."
"115740052-0-19702";"One day young Eplear encountered a merchant and her mother. Enchanted with the merchant's beauty, he asked how he might pursue her heart."
"115740052-0-19703";"""When trees choke the Valen plains and the forest crowns you king … only then shall you hold my daughter's hand in marriage!"" grumbled the merchant's mother."
"115740052-0-19704";"Eplear thought a moment, nodded, and shook the mother's hand. Then he purchased every acorn in the merchant's possession."
"115740052-0-19705";"Eplear the ox-herd traveled across the Valen plains. Where his oxen stopped to feed, he planted acorns in upturned soil. Everywhere he went, he planted."
"115740052-0-19706";"Graht-oaks soon sprouted from the Valen plains. He collected their acorns, traveled, and planted once more. Soon the Valen plains became the Valenwood."
"115740052-0-19707";"The spriggans thought Eplear a powerful wizard. Where he traveled, the graht-oaks grew. They sought him out, and humbled themselves before him."
"115740052-0-19708";"""O great Eplear,"" they cried, ""how can we thank one who has given us so much?"" Eplear thought but a moment. ""With a crown,"" he said."
"115740052-0-19709";"And so King Eplear won the hand of the merchant Camoran. The affection of the spriggans would one day form the basis of the Green Pact …."
"115740052-0-19710";"What's this? It looks like me! What in damnation is going on here?"
"115740052-0-19711";"That's Tharn's voice! What is he doing here?"
"115740052-0-19712";"For how could I let you risk your life in this contraption without testing it first, dear sister?"
"115740052-0-19713";"It's incredible … I can see the White-Gold Tower! I …. No! What's happening to me? Arrgh!"
"115740052-0-19714";"You cannot remain in the Far Shores, mortal. It's time for you to go."
"115740052-0-19715";"Captain, look! It's the stranger who saved us!"
"115740052-0-19716";"No! The tower … it's fading. What have I …."
"115740052-0-19717";"Naemon. What were you thinking?"
"115740052-0-19718";"Around the world!"
"115740052-0-19719";"I'll meet you in town."
"115740052-0-19720";"Put a cork in it, Tharn! Sai's my friend. Probably the best friend I have. If the Vestige is going, I'm going too!"
"115740052-0-19721";"Yes, I see. And you are the most qualified, why? Is it your superior knowledge of Coldharbour? Your expertise in dealing with Daedric entities? Or is it simply the unrequited puppy love you feel for that shirtless mammoth?"
"115740052-0-19722";"Alert! Intruders!"
"115740052-0-19723";"Such an unpleasant and unclean creature! I am sure you have many questions, Vestige."
"115740052-0-19724";"Your soul is mine!"
"115740052-0-19725";"Show us your Dwarf impression!"
"115740052-0-19726";"Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of women and war!"
"115740052-0-19727";"Pirates? In <<1>>? <<2>>'s Jade Dragoons would throw them into the sea!"
"115740052-0-19728";"If she was there! But they marched out, left the city completely undefended!"
"115740052-0-19729";"I need to get back to my superiors. With any luck these bastards will still be in disarray when we sweep back through here."
"115740052-0-19730";"<<1>> is a hero. There's no way she'd abandon <<2>> to pirates."
"115740052-0-19731";"Farewell. They won't be catching me again. A week down here was very motivating."
"115740052-0-19732";"I need a vacation."
"115740052-0-19733";"What is this foolishness? Has your tiny mortal mind snapped? Do you really think you can defeat me?"
"115740052-0-19734";"I am God of Oblivion! You are less than nothing!"
"115740052-0-19735";"Still you fight on? Do you care nothing for your own existence?"
"115740052-0-19736";"Your anguish will be legendary, even in Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-19737";"You won't get away with this. Do you really think you can betray a Daedric Prince?"
"115740052-0-19738";"With the Amulet of Kings, all things are possible! Nations will tremble and bow before me! I will be a god!"
"115740052-0-19739";"The Amulet of Kings will never be yours! It is protected by a ward of the Divines!"
"115740052-0-19740";"You mean your  ward of Stendarr, God of Merciful Forbearance, patron of gutless, law-abiding dimwits? It won't even slow me down!"
"115740052-0-19741";"<<1>> is free of pirates. Looks like <<2>> kicked them out!"
"115740052-0-19742";"How do you know? Were you there? I heard she had nothing to do with it."
"115740052-0-19743";"This is about <<1>>, isn't it? Don't blame her because you backed the wrong side."
"115740052-0-19744";"And now, my minions … surround the intruders!"
"115740052-0-19745";"Bah! You both try my patience. I can almost understand what drove Montclair to abandon our triumvirate."
"115740052-0-19746";"Bangkorai is mine, mortal. You cannot possibly protect it."
"115740052-0-19747";"Your king and queen will soon be slaves in Coldharbour!"
"115740052-0-19748";"Your Covenant cannot escape my wrath. You will see soon enough …."
"115740052-0-19749";"Here or there, the dead are mine to command! Hel Shira! Rise and fight!"
"115740052-0-19750";"A joke, everyone! They are completely harmless … unless you're a blade of grass. Move on back, my pets!"
"115740052-0-19751";"If it were my aspiration, I could rule this plane!"
"115740052-0-19752";"That's our show, everyone! My little friends here need a short rest before their next performance. Please enjoy the rest of <<1>>'s Carnival!"
"115740052-0-19753";"<Person shivers.>"
"115740052-0-19754";"<Person cowers.>"
"115740052-0-19755";"<Person applauds.>"
"115740052-0-19756";"<Person looks around.>"
"115740052-0-19757";"Did you know there's a ruin, beneath these very roots? It's called an ""Orrery."""
"115740052-0-19758";"I've done more than hear about it, my dear. I've seen it myself."
"115740052-0-19759";"Oh. Well, this one hears it's broken anyway. Hasn't functioned in centuries."
"115740052-0-19760";"<<1>> died protecting <<2>>. But she'll be Empress, yes?"
"115740052-0-19761";"Old news, tailed one. And I heard the Orrery turned him into a crocodile."
"115740052-0-19762";"Oh. Well, it must have been a sight to see."
"115740052-0-19763";"Did someone call my name?"
"115740052-0-19764";"Welcome, everyone! I am <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-19765";"And now, I'd like everyone to meet my assistant, <<1>>. Come on out!"
"115740052-0-19766";"<<1>>, say hello to the crowd!"
"115740052-0-19767";"To these bumpkins? I'd rather eat grass."
"115740052-0-19768";"You must face the God of Schemes alone. I will get the others to safety. Go!"
"115740052-0-19770";"What an awful thing to say, here in <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-19771";"But perhaps there's a way we can accommodate you."
"115740052-0-19772";"That's better, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-19773";"What are you doing? No!"
"115740052-0-19774";"With the amulet in my possession, I will absorb Molag Bal's power, reducing him to an empty husk of ethereal flesh. Then I will trap his essence within the gem!"
"115740052-0-19775";"In time, the name Molag Bal will be forgotten! In time, all of Tamriel will bow down before me! Soon, the God of Schemes will have a new name: Mannimarco!"
"115740052-0-19776";"That was the man, dancing in my dreams …."
"115740052-0-19777";"You know, I think he's less stubborn this way."
"115740052-0-19778";"What? What's happening?"
"115740052-0-19779";"No! Not again!"
"115740052-0-19780";"<<1>>, return to your true nature!"
"115740052-0-19781";"All right, I suppose we've had our fun. Time to restore my assistant."
"115740052-0-19782";"You fool! You've foiled my plans, and revealed my true form to everyone in this wretched land!"
"115740052-0-19783";"Have you heard about the madness in <<1>>? My cub-sister said she saw people building houses out of mudcrabs!"
"115740052-0-19785";"And how would that work, exactly? They'd skitter away! Don't believe everything you hear."
"115740052-0-19786";"Doubt if you will. My sister does not lie. I might go there to see for myself."
"115740052-0-19787";"This one hears the strangeness in <<1>> has ended. Seems a Daedric Prince was involved … <<2>> himself!"
"115740052-0-19789";"You believe all you hear. A Daedric Prince? Did your sister see a clutch of butterflies when she was there?"
"115740052-0-19790";"Believe what you like! I'm glad things have calmed down there, whatever the cause."
"115740052-0-19791";"Come forward, Vestige. You are safe, for now. Something precious to you has been riven from Stone-Fire's being. I have brought it here for you to reclaim."
"115740052-0-19793";"<<1>>, you were a Dremora all along? I won't allow you harm these fine people!"
"115740052-0-19795";"You think you can stop me?"
"115740052-0-19796";"No, release me!"
"115740052-0-19797";"Wake up."
"115740052-0-19798";"And now, for the rest of you!"
"115740052-0-19799";"The beast will kill us all!"
"115740052-0-19800";"It breathes the cold fire of Oblivion! Run!"
"115740052-0-19801";"You forgot one thing, foul creature."
"115740052-0-19802";"What might that be, mortal?"
"115740052-0-19803";"The people of <<1>> are closely tied to the forest itself. And you cannot withstand the might of the Green Pact!"
"115740052-0-19804";"This can't be happening! The Green Pact isn't real!"
"115740052-0-19805";"It's real enough to kick you back into the pit from which you crawled!"
"115740052-0-19806";"Everyone, bind your will to mine! Together we can banish him!"
"115740052-0-19807";"No, not back to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-19808";"With your help, we've banished the foul Dremora! Behold the might of the Green Pact."
"115740052-0-19809";"I hope everyone enjoyed the show!"
"115740052-0-19810";"You'll never get away with it, Mannimarco! We'll fight you to our last breath!"
"115740052-0-19811";"By all means, my old friends. Try and stop me!"
"115740052-0-19812";"Stendarr—God of Mercy, Charity, and Justice—empower us with your wisdom and vision. Help us to right the wrongs of this world through your grace and with your guidance. Encourage us as we smite the wicked and punish the unjust!"
"115740052-0-19813";"Stendarr, God of Mercy, Charity and Justice, by your grace and through these consecrations, we beseech you to lower your wards and grant us safe passage into the Vault of Kings."
"115740052-0-19814";"Brilliant. Why is it that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the ones who are most certain of them?"
"115740052-0-19815";"Shut up, Tharn."
"115740052-0-19816";"<Person yawns.>"
"115740052-0-19817";"<Person boos.>"
"115740052-0-19818";"An enchanting moment. I'll be over here, bringing up my lunch."
"115740052-0-19819";"Strange happenings at <<Ac:1>>. They say books are flying of their own accord. Never trust Ayleid ruins, I say."
"115740052-0-19820";"The wisdom of the Ayleids is beyond us. You should know that by now, <<1>>. How long have you traveled through <<2>>?"
"115740052-0-19821";"Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me I don't truly belong. Very hospitable."
"115740052-0-19822";"Someone put the flying books to rest in <<Ac:1>>! Apparently it was Daedra behind it all."
"115740052-0-19823";"The ways of the Ayleid are beyond our ken, dear <<1>>. Who knows what strings now resonate with disharmony?"
"115740052-0-19824";"Sometimes I forget why we're still friends."
"115740052-0-19825";"Dominion soldiers are looking for something at <<Ac:1>>, but frost trolls hinder their progress. Frost trolls!"
"115740052-0-19826";"What are frost trolls doing in <<1>>? Or soldiers, for that matter? Wait, what about your friend in the Falinesti Faithful?"
"115740052-0-19827";"Yes, headed for their annual pilgrimage. I hope she's all right."
"115740052-0-19828";"Did you hear <<1>> was discovered at <<Ac:2>>?"
"115740052-0-19829";"<<1>>? <<2>> has another feather in her cap!"
"115740052-0-19830";"Not exactly. I heard she died recovering it. Must have been a really vicious frost troll."
"115740052-0-19831";"There's a tribe of Argonians living east of <<1>>. Why not settle there, with them?"
"115740052-0-19832";"Why would I want to live with refugees? Especially when the Dominion thinks they may be spies?"
"115740052-0-19833";"Ah, I didn't know. This one remembers what it's like to not belong. I hope the Argonians find a place here, for their sake."
"115740052-0-19834";"Your litter-mates at <<Ac:1>> had their troubles resolved by an outsider! This is good to hear, yes?"
"115740052-0-19835";"I did, yes. But I don't know exactly what that means. Have they been welcomed, or will they be refugees forever?"
"115740052-0-19836";"You should go to <<Ac:1>> and see for yourself. I can look after your affairs. It would be no trouble."
"115740052-0-19837";"Dank corridors, crumbling walls, nauseating smells. This place has all the charm of a Riften brothel. It must feel very much like home to you, Titanborn."
"115740052-0-19838";"You mean a crypt filled with the rotting corpses of inbred kings and failed statesmen. Must be what it's like at a Tharn family reunion."
"115740052-0-19839";"It is much more pleasant in the summer months."
"115740052-0-19841";"You are just in time. Baron Montclair has departed, but Reezal-Jul is here. I am anxious to put an end to that foul Argonian."
"115740052-0-19842";"Just tell me where the amulet is and we can be together forever, Sai. Isn't that what we both want?"
"115740052-0-19843";"Pull it together mutts, we've got a new Scamp that's ready to risk life and limb for glory."
"115740052-0-19844";"And I say we welcome the scamp as only we know how!"
"115740052-0-19845";"I could always use an assistant—or a scribe to record my exploits."
"115740052-0-19846";"I think the new blood could help me in the privy. I'm not supposed to lift anything heavy."
"115740052-0-19847";"You're looking pretty light from here, Felvyn.\n\nI propose a toast to the newcomer!"
"115740052-0-19848";"Hear, hear! A toast!"
"115740052-0-19849";"Aye, a toast and a song!"
"115740052-0-19850";"Hear, hear!"
"115740052-0-19851";"To those who fall in battle to the new Scamp. How shameful it must be—to look upon that ugly face as the last thing you see."
"115740052-0-19852";"Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-19853";"To those who fall in love with the Scamp! For they have sacrificed so much, for so little."
"115740052-0-19854";"To the new scamp's blacksmith. Unused swords rarely need repair!"
"115740052-0-19855";"Fine toasts one and all! Now for the song!"
"115740052-0-19857";"Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?"
"115740052-0-19858";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19859";"Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?"
"115740052-0-19860";"We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19861";"Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?"
"115740052-0-19862";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19863";"Not bad—for a bunch of half-wit drunks. Hah!"
"115740052-0-19864";"Take pride in being Undaunted, scamp. Your deeds will live on long after your body fails."
"115740052-0-19865";"Do you really think that death can stop the most powerful necromancer Tamriel has ever known?"
"115740052-0-19866";"This is merely a transition! My first step towards true immortality!"
"115740052-0-19867";"Now witness my true power! Watch as I rise up from the grave and ascend to godhood!"
"115740052-0-19868";"Worm! You think you can betray the Lord of Brutality and Domination without consequence?"
"115740052-0-19869";"You will pay for your arrogance! You will writhe in agony for the rest of eternity! Your tortured screams will echo throughout Oblivion to serve as a warning to others!"
"115740052-0-19870";"Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of beautiful women and an ugly war!"
"115740052-0-19871";"Miserable fools! You are nothing! I am Mannimarco!"
"115740052-0-19872";"Minions, arise! Obey me!"
"115740052-0-19873";"I grow tired of these games!"
"115740052-0-19874";"I will hold them at the portal! Focus on Mannimarco!"
"115740052-0-19875";"Keep Mannimarco occupied! I'll close the portal!"
"115740052-0-19876";"He's weakening! Don't stop now!"
"115740052-0-19879";"Look alive, slobs! We've a new inductee into our group!"
"115740052-0-19880";"Finally! I'm not the new guy anymore."
"115740052-0-19881";"Nope. You'll always be the new guy, Mindil."
"115740052-0-19882";"Enough. Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-19883";"Always such a ray of sunshine, Talisse. Now a toast from everyone: To the new meat! May they never wet their pants except from drink!"
"115740052-0-19884";"To the new meat, whose best attack is showing their face!"
"115740052-0-19885";"To the new meat! Too brave to run, too dumb to dodge!"
"115740052-0-19886";"To the new meat: Don't die."
"115740052-0-19887";"Really?"
"115740052-0-19888";"Just sing the damn song."
"115740052-0-19889";"Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-19890";"Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?"
"115740052-0-19891";"Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?"
"115740052-0-19892";"Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?"
"115740052-0-19893";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19894";"We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19895";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-19896";"You weren't singing, Talisse."
"115740052-0-19897";"You're fat and old."
"115740052-0-19898";"Turuk, it's true."
"115740052-0-19899";"Ungrateful fools, the both of you. Go back to your drinking and brooding.\n\nAnd milksop: welcome to the Undaunted."
"115740052-0-19900";"I am worry that Captain Janeve will try to take on Tainted-Heart by herself."
"115740052-0-19901";"You filth! You'll not get past me!"
"115740052-0-19902";"You elected to have such narrow avenues ascending the Elden Tree? It's not how we'd do it in Summerset."
"115740052-0-19903";"Hardly surprising. But I dislike the tight climb myself. Truthfully, I prefer the open spaces of the Middens."
"115740052-0-19904";"That sounds positively dreadful."
"115740052-0-19905";"Hey you! What are you doing slinking around my ship?"
"115740052-0-19906";"Ah! There you are. When you have a moment, find me at the Harborage. I've got a question for you."
"115740052-0-19907";"Ugh. Tamriel. How do you stand it?"
"115740052-0-19908";"What is this? Infant! Do you think your toy can slay a god?"
"115740052-0-19909";"No!"
"115740052-0-19910";"Why do you torment me?"
"115740052-0-19911";"Buttons! No!"
"115740052-0-19912";"And the living Undaunted returns! Still living!"
"115740052-0-19913";"The Blacksap light the flame blue today. It's quite glorious, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-19914";"Yes, it means good things are coming …."
"115740052-0-19915";"You killed her. You freed us. Haha!"
"115740052-0-19916";"Hush up, we're being watched."
"115740052-0-19918";"Your continued meddling has reached an end, Hero of Tamriel!"
"115740052-0-19919";"So the spider-slayer returns! Heard you cleared those cobwebs with prejudice!"
"115740052-0-19920";"Why is it so still? I'd heard the graht-oaks never stop moving."
"115740052-0-19921";"Perhaps it grew tired of wandering and is resting? Or perhaps it has always been thus."
"115740052-0-19922";"Whatever the answer, it now marks the center of the Dominion! Even Summerset acknowledges its might!"
"115740052-0-19923";"So long as it stands tall, we will prosper under the shadow of its boughs."
"115740052-0-19924";"I thought the Bosmer worshiped only Hircine!"
"115740052-0-19925";"A common misconception, and there are many who do. Fortunately, the practice seems to be losing favor. With the formation of the Dominion, it may be a difficult tradition to maintain."
"115740052-0-19926";"A pity. Even a brief hunt through the Valenwood would yield prey worthy of Hungry Cat's claws."
"115740052-0-19927";"<<1>>! You worship Daedra?"
"115740052-0-19928";"No, no! But it is a romantic notion, is it not?"
"115740052-0-19929";"Is there truth to these rumors or is this another Bosmer story?"
"115740052-0-19930";"I'm not sure I know what you mean by Bosmer story, friend. But it is true! I have seen them with my own eyes."
"115740052-0-19931";"Doubtful. Though I must admit, my curiosity is piqued."
"115740052-0-19932";"Mine, as well! Perhaps we should arrange a nocturnal visit!"
"115740052-0-19933";"That can be arranged, though I must warn you—Daedra have been seen in the area."
"115740052-0-19934";"You're no bandit. Not like the others, at least."
"115740052-0-19935";"Thank you for that. Now let me do my part."
"115740052-0-19936";"Now, as I'm sure you've all noticed, the Elden Tree is impressively tall. Equally impressive is that <<1>>'s throne lies in the tallest branches of the tree."
"115740052-0-19937";"Excuse me. Is it really at the top? If so, how would one get up there to meet with him?"
"115740052-0-19938";"The trunk has three landings within it. The topmost one takes you to the king's throne. The climb is worth it, I assure you!"
"115740052-0-19939";"Of course, <<1>> has a significant presence of both the Fighters and Mages Guilds. We have sizable halls for both within the tree."
"115740052-0-19940";"Within the tree? How would one find them? The tree is so large."
"115740052-0-19941";"They're easy to find! The trunk has three landings within it, and the middle landing—the one with the shrine—will have passageways to both guildhalls."
"115740052-0-19942";"Additionally, <<1>> has many of its labor facilities, homes, and other elements of the community suspended within the Elden Tree's branches. Isn't that exciting?"
"115740052-0-19943";"On the branches? Is that safe? Is it easy to stumble off of these areas?"
"115740052-0-19944";"Well … yes. That's why you must watch your step while on the platforms!"
"115740052-0-19945";"As you may have encountered, all throughout Valenwood live the spinners—the most faithful devotees of Y'ffre, our most important god."
"115740052-0-19946";"How would this one know a spinner apart from other Bosmer? Not to sound rude, but this one has trouble telling Elves apart."
"115740052-0-19947";"There are three around you now! Look for the Bosmer sitting in scenic places, for they will not move without being moved. All that Spinners should ever do is tell stories, according to Y'ffre."
"115740052-0-19949";"But that is a tale for another time. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-19950";"All finished mucking about in the sewers, are we? Heard it was noble delinquents stirring things up. I take it you taught them a lesson."
"115740052-0-19951";"Some of our Undaunted brethren say you delved into the Crypt of Hearts—and reported the sounds of supernatural battle. I guess the fools were too cowardly to follow you! Ha!"
"115740052-0-19952";"See how it rises above the ruins of Ayleidoon! A testament to the strength and vigor of the Bosmer people!"
"115740052-0-19953";"A fine tree! Think of the ships we could build with one so tall!"
"115740052-0-19954";"Indeed. A pity the life of the tree is so prized by the Bosmer. They've made some sort of accord with Hircine to preserve such things. Civilized Mer should look past such trivialties."
"115740052-0-19955";"Can you not see the strength it affords us? The Graht-oak of <<1>> has stood for millenia! It has sheltered and fed thousands!"
"115740052-0-19956";"And what has it gotten you? The Bosmer sit idly by in their borders, warring among themselves until the mer of value have to step in on your behalf."
"115740052-0-19957";"Better to chop it down for tinder. The forest will hardly miss a few trees."
"115740052-0-19958";"Thrice blasted son of a dreck-sifting root-munching bread-baking sot! May your ears be stuffed with whirlifly larvae, your bow-hand bitten by a rabid stoat ….\n\nMoving on!"
"115740052-0-19959";"Forgive my ignorance, honored guide, but what is a hoarvor? <<1>> has never heard of such a thing."
"115740052-0-19960";"Not spent much time in the Valenwood, eh? Haven't happened upon one of the blood-swilling, scampering, filth-ridden beasts that …."
"115740052-0-19961";"Your people are held very close to the heart of the Dominion, where they will remain for quite a time. Does that about sum up your sentiment, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-19962";"Erm … yes. That about covers it."
"115740052-0-19963";"Is that Sarandel's Carnival? Oh, I love their trained shalks!"
"115740052-0-19965";"Shalks? Do they not spit fire and breathe flame? Is that not dangerous in a forest?"
"115740052-0-19966";"A little singed foliage is a small price to pay for such novelties. I simply must return after the conclusion of our tour."
"115740052-0-19967";"A little singed—<<1>> must be told of this madness!"
"115740052-0-19968";"And rightly so. A natural harbor fit with moorings barely capable of supporting light watercraft. We did you a favor."
"115740052-0-19969";"<<1>> must agree. While your preservation of the green is laudable, trade was stagnant before the Altmer opened Haven for trade."
"115740052-0-19970";"It's not that we don't appreciate the … help provided us by the High Elves. But why trade when the forest supplies all we need?"
"115740052-0-19971";"Begging your pardon, <<1>>, but isn't your bow shaped from Cherrywood? Or did one of your trees give it to you?"
"115740052-0-19972";"Enough. I admit trade agreements have their place—especially in a war—but what are we fighting for if Bosmer traditions are lost as a result?"
"115740052-0-19973";"Honestly, you would think we chopped down the Valenwood! We are paying your traditions as much heed as we can, as far as we understand them! And we've done what we had to—to maintain civilized conduct!"
"115740052-0-19974";"We'll see if you can stop yourself there. I rather doubt it."
"115740052-0-19975";"Preposterous! I'm an Aldmeri vicereeve, an assistant to <<1>> himself! Why am I barred from the ceremony?"
"115740052-0-19976";"<<1>> hasn't been activated in a millennia. It might work splendidly, yes. Or it might explode. But I'll speak with <<2>> if you insist on being present."
"115740052-0-19977";"I …. Upon consideration, I suppose I could wait by the door. To call for help, should anything go wrong."
"115740052-0-19978";"Little brother, you shouldn't be here for this. <<1>> warned us of the dangers."
"115740052-0-19979";"I won't turn my back on family. My place is in your shadow, as it has always been."
"115740052-0-19980";"I know this can't be easy for you."
"115740052-0-19981";"On the contrary. Today the Dominion shall see why a High Elf is fit to lead all of Tamriel."
"115740052-0-19982";"I used to despise your certainty. But today it's … reassuring, oddly enough."
"115740052-0-19983";"Apology accepted."
"115740052-0-19984";"[laughter]"
"115740052-0-19985";"I guess you fancy yourself the new ruler of Volenfell, now that you've conquered it. Too bad all your subjects are dead!"
"115740052-0-19986";"I'm not sure what we're allowed to eat, anymore. The Dominion's got all these rules."
"115740052-0-19987";"It's mostly the same. Essentially, you can eat anything you could before, just not anything that talks."
"115740052-0-19988";"Really? That's a relief. I don't think I did that very much, anyway. Too troublesome."
"115740052-0-19989";"I'm not sure I like how different things are now. All these High Elves and Khajiit in our forest. It's odd."
"115740052-0-19990";"Oh, come on. You're a gatherer, how has their being here affected you at all?"
"115740052-0-19991";"Well, now they tell me places I can't go, because there might be an army there or something stupid like that."
"115740052-0-19992";"I'll make sure everyone clears out, as you requested. But you don't need to be here, Your Highness."
"115740052-0-19993";"I used to sneak in here as a child and climb through <<c:1>>'s rungs! Do you think I'd pass up on the chance to see what it actually does? But have no fear, I want you at the outer door."
"115740052-0-19994";"Thank you, your majesty. I won't let you down."
"115740052-0-19995";"You never do."
"115740052-0-19996";"Ho, ho, the captain's dead! Captain Blackheart's dead! And here comes the one who done the deed …."
"115740052-0-19997";"Well, if it isn't the king of Fungal Grotto! Tell me, is your head heavier now that you're the king?"
"115740052-0-19998";"I heard you fell into a scuffle at Darkshade, new blood! Did you teach those Kwama a lesson? Tell me, how hard is it to squash a bug?"
"115740052-0-19999";"The milksop returns victorious! The milksop is a dangerous milksop, I see!"
"115740052-0-20000";"You're back, new blood! Heard you wrestled with lamias in that old Imperial fort! How'd you like it?"
"115740052-0-20001";"I heard you and those mages ran headfirst into something evil in Elden Hollow. Good to see you live to delve again!"
"115740052-0-20002";"Heard you fought a fierce battle in Direfrost Keep, new blood! Our brethren said they heard fierce storms raging before you emerged! Must've been an epic battle!"
"115740052-0-20003";"Where are you going? I need to get back to Geirmund's Hall."
"115740052-0-20004";"What is this? Are you Champion of the Crucible now, new blood? I heard you put on quite the display!"
"115740052-0-20005";"I heard those Daedra you faced at the City of Ash were led by Mehrunes Dagon himself! You must be a beast in battle, my friend!"
"115740052-0-20006";"People are still talking about that battle on Tempest Island. Did you really kill a hundred Maormer with your bare hands? Alone?"
"115740052-0-20007";"Hrm. Heard you ran into a changeling in Selene's Web! And survived! You might just be worth a damn."
"115740052-0-20008";"By the eight… look!"
"115740052-0-20009";"So, you're telling me that no matter what happens, anything I put here will be safe?"
"115740052-0-20010";"Yes. We've never been robbed. Our security is peerless."
"115740052-0-20011";"Excellent. I'll need you to take care of this for me, then. Keep it safe."
"115740052-0-20012";"What do you mean, gone? I thought your security was peerless!"
"115740052-0-20013";"It is! Or, it was! Either way, I'll get to the bottom of this. I promise you!"
"115740052-0-20014";"We will get to the bottom of this. Don't forget, it's my property that's missing."
"115740052-0-20015";"So, they didn't force the gate. What else do we know?"
"115740052-0-20016";"The guards saw nobody. And there's no sign the lockboxes were forced open."
"115740052-0-20017";"So … what, then? Was I robbed by a ghost? There must be something else at play."
"115740052-0-20018";"So we've ruled it out. I wasn't robbed by a ghost. Sounds like an inside job, to me."
"115740052-0-20019";"There's no chance! Every access to the vault happens in pairs. We monitor one another!"
"115740052-0-20020";"If you say so. A bribe goes a long way. Even when you double it."
"115740052-0-20021";"How do I know you didn't rob the place? That'd be a clever way to do it."
"115740052-0-20022";"There is a troll in that vault. It cannot be pacified by one person alone."
"115740052-0-20023";"You're right, I suppose. Still, I'll find the s'wit who did this. And then I'll feed the troll."
"115740052-0-20024";"You're kidding me. Everything just … reappeared? Including my goods? How?"
"115740052-0-20025";"Yes, the Mages Guild neglected to inform us of the particulars of their vault. It seems your goods were temporarily stored … well, somewhere in Oblivion."
"115740052-0-20026";"Ha! As long as my goods are safe, I don't care where it's stored. Who's going to rob <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-20027";"We heard sounds of battle! What happened?"
"115740052-0-20028";"There was an accident. My brother gave his life to protect us. He died a hero."
"115740052-0-20029";"I … I don't …."
"115740052-0-20030";"I will soon go to <<1>>. <<2>>, I want you to travel ahead with my brother's body. You will make the funeral arrangements."
"115740052-0-20031";"Yes … yes, your majesty. I understand."
"115740052-0-20032";"Spare no expense for his funeral. All in the Dominion are welcome. All may pay their respects to a hero."
"115740052-0-20033";"At once, your majesty."
"115740052-0-20034";"Is this really happening?"
"115740052-0-20035";"I don't know what you mean."
"115740052-0-20036";"You must have seen! You arrived near the end of it."
"115740052-0-20037";"The queen says her brother died a hero. So that's what I saw."
"115740052-0-20038";"Do all you Vinedusk Rangers learn to ignore the truth?"
"115740052-0-20039";"We learn that leadership is messy. And because royalty must grieve in public, we learn not to judge."
"115740052-0-20040";"Perhaps you're right."
"115740052-0-20041";"Good luck, hunter. It's time for me to pass on and rejoin the cycle."
"115740052-0-20042";"<<1>> sent someone to the embassy. We have to leave before we're discovered!"
"115740052-0-20043";"<<1>>? We had assurances. How can we make him our puppet if we can't control him?"
"115740052-0-20044";"It's too late. For the Heritance!"
"115740052-0-20045";"On your feet. You're coming with me."
"115740052-0-20046";"Why? Where are you taking me?"
"115740052-0-20047";"To <<1>>, where you'll answer for crimes against the Dominion."
"115740052-0-20048";"He'll have me killed and served for dinner!"
"115740052-0-20049";"Why would they have us mine? They're soldiers! Shouldn't they be doing the digging?"
"115740052-0-20050";"If they were doing the mining, even more of us would've died, I think."
"115740052-0-20051";"Shouldn't they have been more ready, though? Or, could they have been?"
"115740052-0-20052";"Only if you're proven guilty. And if you are, none of us could stomach you."
"115740052-0-20053";"Now, get moving!"
"115740052-0-20054";"Did you see the trolls? They were white! I've never seen a white troll before!"
"115740052-0-20055";"It's a frost troll. I read about them in a book, once. They're from Skyrim."
"115740052-0-20056";"Y'ffre's bones, what is a troll from Skyrim doing down there?"
"115740052-0-20057";"Good working with you. I'll take her from here. You should inform the king of the good news."
"115740052-0-20058";"Meet me outside. I need to get out of here."
"115740052-0-20059";"You, there! We are escaping! Let me open your door."
"115740052-0-20060";"That's it! Quickly, you must escape before the guards return!"
"115740052-0-20061";"Listen up, you bunch of corset-wearing dog-diddlers! We got a new piece of meat on the rack, fresh from the butcher's block!"
"115740052-0-20062";"Oh good, you're awake! Can you talk?"
"115740052-0-20065";"Don't toddle off just yet. Might I have a word?"
"115740052-0-20066";"And the Undaunted returns! And from the Vaults of Madness themselves! Hope it was worth it—defeating the Mad Architect couldn't have been an easy feat."
"115740052-0-20067";"Blasted Xarxes, I know I shouldn't have … oh. Another one?"
"115740052-0-20068";"Another petitioner, so soon after the other! If it would hold still, I could capture its likeness."
"115740052-0-20070";"No! By rights, I should be the one to take the blade. I'm the one who failed."
"115740052-0-20071";"Nyronie, no. This person has already offered to help us."
"115740052-0-20072";"The sacrifice should come from the wyrd, and I'm the one responsible."
"115740052-0-20073";"Linnae, she's right. The heart of a stranger compared to a self-sacrifice? Hircine is bound to hear and answer."
"115740052-0-20074";"But we need three for the ritual. She can't do it!"
"115740052-0-20075";"The outsider can do it. Only two of us are required for the prayers."
"115740052-0-20076";"I won't allow it."
"115740052-0-20077";"You've no choice. Do you want this to succeed or fail? Nyronie is ready and willing. You know we're right."
"115740052-0-20078";"The Abbey of Blades will rise from these ashes. If I survive the dark path we must walk, I will return to help Kasura shape a new generation of blademasters."
"115740052-0-20079";"A noble goal, Sai. Perhaps I'll join you. For now, we should see to the survivors."
"115740052-0-20080";"The damage is great, but if you had not arrived when you did, there would be nothing left to rebuild. Be safe in the coming days, my friends. I look forward to your return."
"115740052-0-20081";"You continue to surprise me, Sahan. And just when I thought I had you figured out."
"115740052-0-20082";"You can never know me, Tharn. In the Book of Circles, Divad wrote that the greatest of warriors suffers his pain in silence, for he knows that an open oven bakes no bread."
"115740052-0-20083";"My great grandfather Knavus Tharn put it another way: better to keep your silence and be thought an imbecile, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt!"
"115740052-0-20084";"No! I won't let you interrupt my research! I will bring her back!"
"115740052-0-20085";"Meet us in Riften's Inn."
"115740052-0-20086";"I have no time to deal with these fools. Kill them. Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-20087";"There. That should keep them out. Shornhelm will be safe now."
"115740052-0-20088";"If you hurt my sister, I'll kill you myself!"
"115740052-0-20089";"Where's my sister? Where is she?"
"115740052-0-20090";"What do you suppose this place was?"
"115740052-0-20091";"A temple of some kind. The Dark Anchors may have pulled it into Coldharbour. Or, perhaps it was created by the Daedra to mock the Divines."
"115740052-0-20092";"What does it matter? We can't wait any longer. We must perform the ritual. Vestige, it is time for you to make your decision."
"115740052-0-20096";"Your generosity is five-clawed, my friend! Listen, everyone. That one bought this one a drink. This calls for a song!"
"115740052-0-20097";"You asked for a drink? Tubidan. You're dead. What a waste of coin!"
"115740052-0-20098";"An enemy approaches. Strike it down!"
"115740052-0-20099";"Sai, are you well enough to continue?"
"115740052-0-20100";"Have no fear, Snow Lily. I am Redguard. We are like mountain bamboo: far stronger and more flexible then we might appear."
"115740052-0-20101";"I find it hilarious that Mannimarco chose such a massive projected appearance. He's obviously overcompensating for something."
"115740052-0-20102";"Do not slow, Vestige. With the passing of time, any indecision becomes decision."
"115740052-0-20103";"Countess, Baron, please. We must remain focused. As long as Montclair controls the upper city, the whole region remains at risk."
"115740052-0-20104";"Another enemy blocks the path ahead. Dispatch it quickly."
"115740052-0-20105";"The God of Brutality knows of your escape. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-20106";"We'll never forget you Sire, or your sacrifice."
"115740052-0-20107";"Snow Lily, no … don't do this. Please."
"115740052-0-20108";"Sai, I … I'll never forget you. And we'll finish this, I swear it."
"115740052-0-20109";"You're an idiot, Tubidan."
"115740052-0-20110";"Silence, both of you! That one bought Khajiit a drink."
"115740052-0-20111";"So now you're going to sing?"
"115740052-0-20112";"No. Khajiit is most Undaunted here. You will sing."
"115740052-0-20113";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-20114";"And you will sing, Sahba."
"115740052-0-20115";"Go play in the Vaults of Madness, Tubidan."
"115740052-0-20116";"All are staying in this tavern until you sing! So sing, fools!"
"115740052-0-20118";"Hey! You! Help me out of this mess."
"115740052-0-20119";"Position yourself over there, Vestige. And brace yourself."
"115740052-0-20120";"Up the stairs, quickly! We must get to the anchor mooring!"
"115740052-0-20121";"I do not disagree, Baron, but we need to proceed with caution. There is more to this situation than meets the eye."
"115740052-0-20122";"I know I make you both nervous. Perhaps we should continue this after our blood has cooled."
"115740052-0-20123";"Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?"
"115740052-0-20124";"Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?"
"115740052-0-20125";"Yes. Yes!"
"115740052-0-20126";"Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?"
"115740052-0-20127";"We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-20128";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-20129";"Tell me! Tell me who!"
"115740052-0-20130";"Help! This crazy bird is trying to kill me!"
"115740052-0-20131";"We are finished here. It is time to go home."
"115740052-0-20132";"I thought I was going to be dinner! Thanks! I'll see you back at the village."
"115740052-0-20133";"Everything Mannimarco did was designed to pit us against each other. We can't let that happen. Look what we can accomplish when we work together."
"115740052-0-20134";"Louder! By the Bright Moons! Louder!"
"115740052-0-20135";"How uncharacteristically optimistic of you, Titanborn. I may have that embroidered on a pillow."
"115740052-0-20136";"That's the stuff!"
"115740052-0-20137";"The Divines gave you a nose for a reason, Tharn. So you can keep your mouth shut and still keep breathing."
"115740052-0-20138";"Someone pass a sword through my face."
"115740052-0-20139";"It wouldn't kill you."
"115740052-0-20140";"Well played, Titanborn. Well played."
"115740052-0-20141";"Never a dull moment with those two. Come. Let's go home."
"115740052-0-20142";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-20143";"Oh …."
"115740052-0-20144";"You're not one for waiting in lines, are you?"
"115740052-0-20145";"Thank the Light! Janeve, my sister. You're alive!"
"115740052-0-20146";"Wait … what happened to …? No, no! Not you, Janeve! Not you!"
"115740052-0-20147";"What? Where am I? Sister? What has he done to me? What … what have I done?"
"115740052-0-20148";"Janeve. Oh, Janeve. We'll figure this out. Just stay calm."
"115740052-0-20149";"Please. I need your assistance."
"115740052-0-20150";"Are you telling me you've made absolutely no progress on the contract we signed with you?"
"115740052-0-20151";"It's Armel's fault. His stupid trap malfunctioned again."
"115740052-0-20152";"It's not my fault! Those harpies are crafty! And bloodthirsty!"
"115740052-0-20153";"Is that why you reek? What is that smell?"
"115740052-0-20154";"The harpies! They're here! The scent lure on these two brought the whole flock down on us!"
"115740052-0-20155";"We need to wash this stuff off before the harpies get us! To the pond!"
"115740052-0-20156";"Please, go with them. The villagers and I will hide from the beasts."
"115740052-0-20158";"The poor girl. May these flames purify her spirit."
"115740052-0-20159";"Elder, what do you believe happened to her?"
"115740052-0-20160";"Her body was … mangled, rent apart by a terrible darkness. Its corruption is still on her. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-20161";"Is it true her wounds healed on their own?"
"115740052-0-20162";"Yes. This is why I insisted we perform this rite at once."
"115740052-0-20163";"Elder, the girl…"
"115740052-0-20164";"No. We're too late."
"115740052-0-20165";"No! Back away."
"115740052-0-20166";"Thank … you …"
"115740052-0-20167";"Your blood … your blood will end my pain!"
"115740052-0-20168";"Not like this! No! No!"
"115740052-0-20169";"Master, no!"
"115740052-0-20170";"You have done enough, friend. I'll deal with this. Head outside. I'll join you shortly."
"115740052-0-20171";"I suspect that Reezal-Jul is behind that stone door. Along with his portal. We need to stop him from bringing through more reinforcements."
"115740052-0-20172";"Do it quickly, dear sister, while my mind is still my own."
"115740052-0-20173";"Come Janeve, drink this. It will make your passing swift and painless. Now, let us pray."
"115740052-0-20174";"Fool! Releasing me gains you nothing!"
"115740052-0-20175";"Arkay! Answer me! I am your priestess! Answer!"
"115740052-0-20176";"There you are. Baron Dorell told me to keep an eye out for you."
"115740052-0-20177";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-20178";"Molag Bal said you would not come."
"115740052-0-20179";"He said you turned your light away from me!"
"115740052-0-20180";"Arkay! Do you hear me? You are false! I reject you!"
"115740052-0-20181";"Gwendis, my child, slow down. You eat too fast. You don't want to harm poor Kallin."
"115740052-0-20182";"We need to feed to get stronger. When Montclair shows up, I want to be ready!"
"115740052-0-20183";"That is not our way, child, and you know it. Stop feasting. Now!"
"115740052-0-20184";"Fine. Whatever. I mean, I'm sorry, Count Verandis. You know I only want to help."
"115740052-0-20185";"Of course, my child. Now, let's clear away our meal and welcome our friend. Kallin, as always, I thank you for sharing your life's blood with us."
"115740052-0-20186";"According to the contract, you were to complete the project without additional help."
"115740052-0-20187";"What? Maybe we didn't work in a conventional way, but we got rid of the harpies."
"115740052-0-20188";"In accordance with our contract, your pay goes to the one who did the work, not to you."
"115740052-0-20189";"This decision will come back to haunt us, mark my words. Let's just get out of this vile cave and let the Light guide our path."
"115740052-0-20190";"An ancestor spirit? Here? What are you—"
"115740052-0-20191";"Free. Free to face me. Free to die by my blade!"
"115740052-0-20192";"I live to please, my lord."
"115740052-0-20193";"Thank you, Uncle! You won't regret this!"
"115740052-0-20194";"Gelvin is not going to be happy when he hears this."
"115740052-0-20195";"Don't thank me, dear nephew. Enjoy your consignment to Oblivion."
"115740052-0-20196";"I'll do my best. Lead on."
"115740052-0-20198";"What are you doing here? Intruders!"
"115740052-0-20199";"Get ready! Here they come!"
"115740052-0-20200";"Scrub faster! They're still coming."
"115740052-0-20201";"I'm scrubbing as fast as I can!"
"115740052-0-20202";"Could someone get my back please?"
"115740052-0-20203";"Hey! What do you say we just leave the Remly brothers for the harpies? Bird-women need love too!"
"115740052-0-20204";"We're almost done! Just a little longer!"
"115740052-0-20205";"Believe it or not, I think we solved their harpy problem! Nice work! Let's get back to the village and check in with the elder."
"115740052-0-20206";"Adusa, please make sure Gwendis behaves herself. Poor Kallin needs time to recover."
"115740052-0-20207";"The little one gets no dessert this evening. Adusa will make sure."
"115740052-0-20208";"To understand the path that Montclair follows, you must understand how he came to walk upon it. I believe the key to stopping him hides within my own memories."
"115740052-0-20209";"Memories are elusive shadows, hiding truths behind our own perceptions. But what if someone else could examine them? What would they see that we do not?"
"115740052-0-20210";"I'd like to try something, if you're willing. This potion will allow you to dream-walk through my memories. Perhaps your eyes will see what I have missed."
"115740052-0-20212";"Well, I am staying here."
"115740052-0-20213";"Look at this! You think that's the skull of King Ranser? Maybe he was decapitated!"
"115740052-0-20214";"Why will you not listen? Beef-witted beast! Must I tie a torch to your tail again to teach you?"
"115740052-0-20215";"Your friend has vouched for your good work. Though your methods were unconventional, you greatly thinned the harpy flock."
"115740052-0-20216";"All in a day's work. We're glad we could help!"
"115740052-0-20217";"Here's the agreed-upon payment. Stories of your heroic deeds will be told to all those that pass through our camp."
"115740052-0-20218";"Thank you. Our business is all word of mouth, so that'll be a huge help. And thank you, friend! We won't forget your support, either."
"115740052-0-20219";"Fadeel … what are you doing? Wait! No! Come back here you stupid beast!"
"115740052-0-20220";"There's trouble in Crestshade, but I'm not sure I'll find a safe haven at that place up there."
"115740052-0-20221";"I think I'll rest here for a moment before making my way to Shornhelm."
"115740052-0-20222";"Initiate. Kneel in the black pool and submit yourself to me."
"115740052-0-20223";"I must say, it's rather strange seeing you as … me."
"115740052-0-20224";"Mother … please. You have to take the medicine. Reezal-Jul can help you!"
"115740052-0-20225";"Oh, sweet daughter, I can't go on like this. I don't want to spend my final days as an experiment. Instead, let me spend them with the ones I love."
"115740052-0-20226";"Even in retrospect, reliving this is difficult. Her pain, her suffering. She had so much courage."
"115740052-0-20227";"There has to be something more we can do. Verandis, can I talk to you for a moment?"
"115740052-0-20228";"As you wish, m'lady."
"115740052-0-20229";"Hey, over here. Just a moment, before you go inside …."
"115740052-0-20230";"It's only a trap if you don't know about it. I assume everything is a trap. Therefore, it's a challenge."
"115740052-0-20231";"What do you think? Trap?"
"115740052-0-20232";"Something's wrong. I have vague recollections of talking to someone else, but why can't I remember? You need to look around, see what we missed …."
"115740052-0-20234";"She seems to be drawing power from those stones. Destroy them, quickly!"
"115740052-0-20235";"Time to feast!"
"115740052-0-20236";"Vestige! Hold a moment!"
"115740052-0-20237";"I shall begin my research at once. Try to determine where Reezal-Jul has gone. In the meantime, you should seek out the High King."
"115740052-0-20238";"I am whole again! Meet me where I slayed the mad king. Perhaps I can finally end this horrid existence."
"115740052-0-20239";"Without your help, my friend, I would have never recalled that Reezal-Jul led us to the Ayleid relic. What else have I forgotten, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-20240";"Three cheers for Verandis! He gave me the means to save my beautiful wife!"
"115740052-0-20242";"Ranser! You madman! It's time to finish this!"
"115740052-0-20243";"Yes, to our dear friend, Verandis! How can we ever repay him?"
"115740052-0-20244";"He is great, isn't he? And so handsome! But I want to cheer about this wine. By the Divines, this stuff is delicious!"
"115740052-0-20245";"We were so happy at this moment. We were all together, friends and family, enjoying each other's company. For the final time …."
"115740052-0-20246";"Verandis, may I speak to you for a moment? Alone."
"115740052-0-20247";"I … I don't recall speaking with Leila. Why can't I remember that?"
"115740052-0-20248";"You know, that Varen fellow was always a good chap, even if he did muck things up at the start. And he did put things right in the end, didn't he?"
"115740052-0-20249";"He's still with you, you know. A part of you, really. And perhaps he can continue to serve the land and the people he gave his life to save, through you.\n\nThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left."
"115740052-0-20250";"Ah, fair Lyris. She will be missed. Her light may have left this world, but her spirit lives on in you … perhaps even in a literal sense. Take comfort in that."
"115740052-0-20251";"When I was a priestess of Arkay, Molag Bal ravaged me and left me for dead. A group of nomads tried to purify me with fire. But I awoke … changed."
"115740052-0-20252";"And she did give her life to save this world, didn't she? Though I can't understand why you're all so fond of it. Dreadful place. Ah well, it's horses for courses, I suppose.\n\nThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left."
"115740052-0-20254";"When I saw what I had done, I called out to my god, Arkay. I prayed that he would rid me of Molag Bal's curse. But Arkay did not answer."
"115740052-0-20255";"I don't know that this world will ever see the like of Sai Sahan again. He was the embodiment of loyalty and discipline—qualities that he tried to share, not by word, but by deed.\n\nYou can make use of that. He's part of you now, you know."
"115740052-0-20256";"Our noble Redguard friend may have shuffled off this mortal coil, but his spirit will live on, through you.\n\nThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left."
"115740052-0-20257";"A real chasm or another illusion? We probably shouldn't chance it. See if you can locate another tear."
"115740052-0-20258";"The stone reacts differently to you, Count. How remarkable."
"115740052-0-20259";"We shouldn't have left the guards behind, Wylon. Who knows what else we're going to run into?"
"115740052-0-20260";"There was no choice, Mother. You're getting worse and we can't wait for them."
"115740052-0-20261";"I'll stay here and protect the way out. Keep watch in case the guards catch up with us. The rest of you need to keep moving."
"115740052-0-20262";"Thank you, Gwendis. At least you retain a sense of honor."
"115740052-0-20263";"Wylon, you have to stop blaming Verandis. This wasn't his fault."
"115740052-0-20264";"I am a married woman, so you must starve. Unless you care to feast upon yourself."
"115740052-0-20266";"Verandis, we need you! We need your power! Quickly! Touch the relic and help us!"
"115740052-0-20267";"Father … what … what's happening to us?"
"115740052-0-20268";"Please, Verandis. Help me! Make it stop! I … I can't stand the pain."
"115740052-0-20270";"No! Verandis! What did you do to Leila? What did you do?"
"115740052-0-20271";"You'll pay for that, vampire! I have the power now. Nothing can stop me from reaching out and snapping …."
"115740052-0-20272";"Verandis? Montclair, no! Come on, Verandis, we need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-20273";"Now we know why the Falinesti Faithful were forced to dig. We should speak of this."
"115740052-0-20274";"This way. With the veil torn I can see a way up over there."
"115740052-0-20275";"Help! Oh, help me! Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-20276";"Oh, dear. I suppose I'll have to find a way to undo this."
"115740052-0-20277";"Come on! Mother doesn't have much time left."
"115740052-0-20278";"Ayleid skeletons, undead spirits—it doesn't matter. Nothing is going to stand in our way!"
"115740052-0-20279";"End this, Verandis. End this before I … arrgh!"
"115740052-0-20281";"If you're looking for calipers, you won't find any in there."
"115740052-0-20282";"Yes m'lady. Please try not to get any on my clothes. Blood is murder to get out."
"115740052-0-20283";"Now just hold still Stibbons …."
"115740052-0-20284";"If you are looking for money, you sure won't find any here."
"115740052-0-20285";"Well, I was going to use those for dinner."
"115740052-0-20286";"Now you, Goblin, drink from the chalice."
"115740052-0-20287";"My claws and daggers are ready! This one will fight like a whirlwind of fury!"
"115740052-0-20288";"What? What's happening …?"
"115740052-0-20289";"Oh, dear … that was an unexpected side effect."
"115740052-0-20290";"I think perhaps it's best if you go ahead and close up the shop early today, Lady Mondorie. In fact, why don't you go ahead and do that now."
"115740052-0-20291";"Yes, Constable Gavendien. I'll close up right away. Just don't do anything … rash."
"115740052-0-20292";"There is no choice in the matter. The constable says we need your wagon, and your horse."
"115740052-0-20293";"But … but what will I do? If I can't haul grain, I can't make any coin! My family will starve!"
"115740052-0-20295";"Hold the troops here until I give the signal. I don't want to risk loyal soldiers or city assets prematurely."
"115740052-0-20296";"As you command, my lord."
"115740052-0-20297";"What are you doing in my city, Lleraya?"
"115740052-0-20298";"As you wish, m'lady."
"115740052-0-20299";"What have you done? My manservant is a Goblin! It'll take me forever to undo this!"
"115740052-0-20300";"Har! Yes … revenge!"
"115740052-0-20301";"You walked into the wrong farm house, Montclair!"
"115740052-0-20302";"I heard what happened to Turenn, and I came as fast as I could."
"115740052-0-20303";"Gabria! Thank you so much for coming. I need your help."
"115740052-0-20304";"Don't worry, sir. Turenn planned everything. We've got you set up as a merchant in Orsinium."
"115740052-0-20305";"That's perfect. As it happens, I have friends there."
"115740052-0-20306";"Then let us be on our way."
"115740052-0-20307";"Thank you for your mercy, friend. We won't be seeing each other again."
"115740052-0-20308";"Heard you'd been trying to make amends, old man. You know what I think?"
"115740052-0-20309";"Over here! I'm hiding. Arkay help me but I loathe skeevers."
"115740052-0-20310";"Goblins!"
"115740052-0-20311";"Click on the soul hoogies and run to the shrines to charge them!"
"115740052-0-20312";"Begin collecting."
"115740052-0-20313";"The hoard approach. Protect us!"
"115740052-0-20314";"The only redemption for a murderous bastard like you is a slow, painful death, and we're going to give it to you!"
"115740052-0-20315";"RELEASE THE MCCRACKEN!"
"115740052-0-20316";"Get up! You can rot in the stockade for a little while first."
"115740052-0-20317";"Fair Guendeline, come forth and hear my words of love!"
"115740052-0-20318";"This should be interesting."
"115740052-0-20319";"I look to the firmament and thirteen constellations do I see …."
"115740052-0-20320";"But even the stars look dark and lonely without thee …."
"115740052-0-20321";"But in your eyes, there is enough light, to guide me through any night …. Oh Julien! That's my favorite poem! We were meant for each other! I love you and I will wait for you!"
"115740052-0-20322";"I go to war now, my love. But when I return, we shall be married."
"115740052-0-20323";"The skin of your neck exudes an animal stench …."
"115740052-0-20324";"I want to pull your hair and call you a …."
"115740052-0-20325";"Stop! Please, just … no more. That's the most vile poetry I've ever heard! Go away, Julien. For good this time!"
"115740052-0-20326";"I guess that's it then. I thought that was quite good, myself. But without her … oh, what will I do?"
"115740052-0-20327";"I look at you coming down the stair …."
"115740052-0-20328";"And I wonder, did you forget to brush your hair …?"
"115740052-0-20329";"My hair …? How could you embarrass me like this? Go away, Julien. Go away and never come back."
"115740052-0-20330";"I guess maybe I should've planned that better. What have I done? I've ruined my whole life in two sentences!"
"115740052-0-20332";"Have you forgotten? You do want us to keep your family safe, do you not? I suggest you close your mouth."
"115740052-0-20334";"Celestial of the Warrior! Akatosh calls you false. Cease your attacks on our people and begone!"
"115740052-0-20335";"We do not fear you. Come, face me in the pit!"
"115740052-0-20336";"Aktasoh is a false god, as are all the Aedra. Craglorn belongs to me!"
"115740052-0-20337";"You are beneath me, priest. But my Yokudans will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-20338";"Destroy these echos of Yokuda, defenders of Craglorn! Protect me!"
"115740052-0-20339";"Lock him up. Make sure to spit in his face every hour, too."
"115740052-0-20340";"With pleasure. Heh."
"115740052-0-20341";"The large door straight ahead. Clearly, that's the main entrance. That's the way we should proceed."
"115740052-0-20342";"This door is closer. It could provide a shorter path. Perhaps fewer bloodfiends to contend with."
"115740052-0-20343";"I'd rather cut through the enemies I can see than walk blindly into something I can't. The ruins might be full of traps!"
"115740052-0-20344";"My dear Baron, you have an annoying habit of never listening to a word I say. You'll do as you please. As usual."
"115740052-0-20345";"You! In the attic! I am Alard, Baron of House Dorell, and I swear you will be safe in my hands!"
"115740052-0-20346";"And you as well. But tell me—is Ellic hiding up there?"
"115740052-0-20347";"I'm sorry to say, but no. I left him at your manor. He insisted that he wanted to stay."
"115740052-0-20349";"See how the people love me! They even share their life essences with me!"
"115740052-0-20350";"You hate me, don't you? Why does everyone hate me?"
"115740052-0-20351";"Use the spheres against her! Destroy them and take them as your own!"
"115740052-0-20352";"Why do you hate me Verandis? Why can't you love me?"
"115740052-0-20353";"This should never have happened this way. Look how my efforts went astray."
"115740052-0-20354";"What … what happened?"
"115740052-0-20355";"Ready yourself, Five-Claw! Here they come."
"115740052-0-20356";"I'll be having a drink at the Dusklight Inn in Hoarfrost Downs. I'll wait for you there."
"115740052-0-20357";"Magic level is 1/3 full."
"115740052-0-20358";"Magic level 2/3."
"115740052-0-20359";"OH MAMA!"
"115740052-0-20360";"People, listen to me. Let's head outside and make sure the rest of the city is secure."
"115740052-0-20361";"We'll return for the fallen later. Right now the living need us more."
"115740052-0-20362";"Meet this one outside, my friend. Let's make sure we eliminated all of the assassins."
"115740052-0-20363";"In the name of High King Emeric and in accordance with the laws of the land, I hearby order the arrest of Ellic Dorell for treason and the death of his kinsmen!"
"115740052-0-20364";"But Father, it wasn't my fault!"
"115740052-0-20365";"You allowed an enemy into our city, into our home! Dozens fell to these monsters because you couldn't ignore a pretty face!"
"115740052-0-20366";"I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I'm not even sure what happened. Lleraya said she wanted to help and I … I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-20367";"Apologies won't bring our people back. It won't return honor to our family name. Guards! Take Ellic away."
"115740052-0-20368";"You are dead to me, Ellic. Dead to me."
"115740052-0-20369";"I'm sorry I disappointed you, Father. It won't happen again."
"115740052-0-20370";"Arkay protect us! What is that?"
"115740052-0-20371";"Baron Montclair. He's here."
"115740052-0-20372";"Troops! On my command!"
"115740052-0-20373";"Welcome, Verandis! And like a good guest, I see you've brought me gifts to play with."
"115740052-0-20374";"Allow me to grant my blessing to your army."
"115740052-0-20375";"This is exactly what I feared! He's turned our own troops into bloodfiends!"
"115740052-0-20376";"How does it feel to watch those who you care about turn against you, Verandis? How does it feel?"
"115740052-0-20377";"My wife … my daughter … you've taken everything I ever loved, Verandis!"
"115740052-0-20378";"Wylon, I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen."
"115740052-0-20379";"My daughter loved you, Verandis. She loved you!"
"115740052-0-20380";"The Remnant … the power. It drove Lleraya insane! Are those giant skeletons?"
"115740052-0-20381";"This was just what I needed! You go on ahead. I'll wait here and make sure the way stays clear."
"115740052-0-20382";"You've grown strong, Verandis. Your allies grant you strength."
"115740052-0-20383";"Come out and face us, you coward! You can't hide from us forever!"
"115740052-0-20384";"Wylon, please. We can find a way to free you from this power."
"115740052-0-20385";"To what end, my old friend? My wife is dead. My daughter, killed by your own hand. What do I have, if not this power?"
"115740052-0-20386";"I think I'd prefer to let you experience my pain. My suffering. To let you see what it's like to lose everything you hold dear!"
"115740052-0-20387";"No, Montclair! Stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-20388";"Come, Gwendis. You look famished. Allow me to prepare you a feast fit for my new queen!"
"115740052-0-20389";"No, Montclair! Please!"
"115740052-0-20390";"Destroy those ogrim! You must not let them reach me!"
"115740052-0-20391";"The Atronaches! Destroy them, or I'll be ripped apart!"
"115740052-0-20392";"The way is open."
"115740052-0-20393";"I will avenge this humiliation. You fools have not heard the last of me!"
"115740052-0-20394";"We have defeated the Celestial, brave warriors! Akatosh has proven stronger than the pretender god!"
"115740052-0-20395";"Celebrate this victory and enjoy your spoils, heroes of Craglorn!"
"115740052-0-20396";"Ha ha ha ha ha! The meager power of Akatosh is no protection from my will. Look upon me, ye mortals, and despair!"
"115740052-0-20397";"What a strange chamber. Look at the tiles on the floor. I wonder if this is an Ayleid device to operate the barriers?"
"115740052-0-20399";"Do not test me again, or you will suffer for it. Minions! To me!"
"115740052-0-20400";"I'm sorry, sir. I tried, but no one here is willing to enlist."
"115740052-0-20401";"Unacceptable, Captain. Either deliver me recruits or deliver me your resignation."
"115740052-0-20402";"Quiet as the grave. Wherever they are, they're not here."
"115740052-0-20403";"Dulkhi was causing her worry? The servant? My word! We should search her quarters. Perhaps something there will hint at what happened."
"115740052-0-20404";"There! Stendarr's mercy, let her have left some clue."
"115740052-0-20406";"When we were children, Arlie and I came here to get away from the world. What I wouldn't give to have her with us now."
"115740052-0-20407";"That's the key to the Undercroft. That must have been what the Baroness hid here! But why? We should investigate."
"115740052-0-20408";"Arlie told her mother? Then it's true. It's all true."
"115740052-0-20409";"The Undercroft. Steel yourself, we don't know what's down there."
"115740052-0-20410";"Arlie's mother did this? She summoned a Daedric prince to … to …. But why?"
"115740052-0-20411";"Stendarr's mercy!"
"115740052-0-20412";"Never fear, the amazing Darien is here!"
"115740052-0-20413";"Another battle, another victory. Go on ahead. I'll stay here and guard the door."
"115740052-0-20414";"Look! Something's happening! Can you see them? The Ayleid spirits? Watch which tiles they go to."
"115740052-0-20415";"Each tile is marked with a constellation! Perhaps if we repeat the actions of the spirits, we can open the barrier that blocks our way."
"115740052-0-20416";"You did it! The barrier has disappeared! We can move on and try to find the portal chamber now."
"115740052-0-20417";"We've nearly made it, but there is another ward and an odd statue that seems to be guarding it."
"115740052-0-20418";"What is that? Are you seeing this?"
"115740052-0-20419";"That did it!"
"115740052-0-20420";"Be on your guard. Montclair will do everything he can to stop us."
"115740052-0-20421";"If Gwendis has been harmed, or any of our friends … I'll show him no mercy."
"115740052-0-20422";"We're close. I can sense that Gwendis is nearby."
"115740052-0-20423";"Arlie!"
"115740052-0-20424";"Please don't tell Arlie this, but her mother's responsible for bringing us here. She may not be happy to see us."
"115740052-0-20425";"Get off your arses, boys. Go take down those traps. We don't need them anymore."
"115740052-0-20426";"But Bumnog! We just finished setting them up!"
"115740052-0-20427";"I get to take down the pots. It's your turn to get caught up in those nets."
"115740052-0-20428";"Go on. The second portal chamber should be on the third level. I want to make sure this portal is stable and then I'll follow after you."
"115740052-0-20429";"Another mortal come to play?"
"115740052-0-20430";"Well now, I've broken a sweat! I've not had this much fun in ages!"
"115740052-0-20431";"Please, I don't want to die!"
"115740052-0-20432";"Hey! Over here! Help! Please!"
"115740052-0-20433";"This lava goes on as far as I can see. How can anything live in this place?"
"115740052-0-20434";"There it is. That's where they keep the <<1>>."
"115740052-0-20436";"Funny. She's not as scary now."
"115740052-0-20437";"Another barrier blocks our way. Look around and see if you can find a way to disable it."
"115740052-0-20438";"Gwendis? What has he done to you?"
"115740052-0-20439";"Verandis … help. Please, help me. Their blood … smells so good! These restraints. They won't hold me back much longer."
"115740052-0-20440";"You must control yourself, Gwendis. We'll find a way to get you out of there."
"115740052-0-20441";"Show yourself, Wylon! Tell me what you want!"
"115740052-0-20442";"You did it! You were able to widen the tear so that we can see the path ahead as it truly is."
"115740052-0-20443";"The way ahead appears blocked, but I'm sure it's another illusion."
"115740052-0-20444";"Well done, my friend! I'll meet you on the other side."
"115740052-0-20445";"I'm sorry, they forced me to do it! I had no choice!"
"115740052-0-20446";"Larelleis? The time of sweet water? That must refer to spring rains."
"115740052-0-20447";"Quickly. Bring the shards to the shrines."
"115740052-0-20448";"The green shine? That's close but not quite right. I'm guessing this refers to summer."
"115740052-0-20449";"Morilatta? The dark light? Dusk? I think this one is referring to autumn."
"115740052-0-20450";"Anga? That could mean iron. Or cold. I suppose this one refers to winter."
"115740052-0-20451";"The titans have descended!"
"115740052-0-20452";"Excellent. Let's step outside. Lead on!"
"115740052-0-20453";"Damn you, Montclair! Answer me! I'm sorry, my friend, but it seems we're going to have to play Montclair's game to free the others."
"115740052-0-20454";"The statues! Their magic is too strong! Use the gargoyles to help you destroy them!"
"115740052-0-20455";"Hold on just a while longer, Gwendis. We're going to get you out of there."
"115740052-0-20456";"The power is dropping!"
"115740052-0-20457";"Gwendis, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-20458";"I … I did it. I resisted! I didn't feed. Wait, what happened to the nobles? Did … did I remember wrong?"
"115740052-0-20459";"They're fine. Merely unconscious. I'm proud of your restraint, Gwendis."
"115740052-0-20460";"What's going on in here? Is the Countess all right?"
"115740052-0-20461";"Damn it, Darien! Slow down! Wait for me, you long-legged bastard."
"115740052-0-20462";"The Baron and the Countess are fine. But you both arrived just in time to move them to safety."
"115740052-0-20463";"Take them out? But we just got here. We want to help take down Montclair! Neither of us has had a good fight in … well, it's been at least a couple of minutes."
"115740052-0-20464";"No, Darien. This battle is not one that you and Skordo can win. Leave Montclair to us."
"115740052-0-20465";"But … but … oh, very well! But I get to help take down the next would-be world conquerer we come across. Deal?"
"115740052-0-20466";"As you wish, brave Darien, as you wish. And now, my friend, the time has come to face Montclair."
"115740052-0-20467";"Let's get moving. Arlie … be safe."
"115740052-0-20468";"I feel like I'm living every mage's dream. I'm working with the Arch Mage Shalidor, the Legend from the first era! I just wish I felt like I was up to the challenge."
"115740052-0-20469";"I don't know how I wound up here, working with you and him. This is by far the most unexpected outcome to a book collecting errand I've ever sent an Adept on!"
"115740052-0-20470";"It's all so much, so fast. I don't know if I told you, but I've only been the Master of Inconubla for a short time now. I feel like I'm still settling into my role."
"115740052-0-20471";"The barrier has fallen! The portal chamber should be just a short way ahead."
"115740052-0-20473";"Yes. That. I'd forgotten about that. Let's continue."
"115740052-0-20474";"I see your point. Every once in a while I manage to remember something from a dusty tome that's of use. Thank you for reminding me."
"115740052-0-20475";"The Doomcrag waits just beyond this chamber. The Doomcrag and Baron Montclair."
"115740052-0-20476";"Enemies Coming in 20 seconds."
"115740052-0-20477";"I hate to admit it, but I think they got to me, the ones that taunted me and pestered me when I was young. I was the one with her nose in a book, just the type of target some cruel children love to hurt."
"115740052-0-20478";"That's what drew me to this post in the Mages Guild. All those years with books means I'm more comfortable with a tome than I am in the field, or even with others."
"115740052-0-20479";"Time to regroup. Harder Pulls starting in 45 seconds."
"115740052-0-20480";"Giant Boss Coming in 30 seconds."
"115740052-0-20481";"All right, everyone. Let's gather up our injured and get out of here."
"115740052-0-20482";"Darien's right. There's nothing left for us here. We need to return to the High King and let him know what happened."
"115740052-0-20484";"You won. See D. Crenshaw for your prize."
"115740052-0-20485";"Mage, we need a portal. To Shornhelm, if you please."
"115740052-0-20486";"Of course, Baron. Only take a moment."
"115740052-0-20488";"Look, everyone! We've got a survivor!"
"115740052-0-20489";"Time to kick some skeletal arse!"
"115740052-0-20490";"The portal to Shornhelm is open, my lord."
"115740052-0-20491";"Arlie!"
"115740052-0-20492";"You've meddled in my father's business long enough. It looks like I'll have to kill you myself."
"115740052-0-20493";"You are a worm and you will die like a worm, you worm!"
"115740052-0-20494";"Arlie, dear, you really must settle something for us."
"115740052-0-20495";"Tell him."
"115740052-0-20496";"Tell him what?"
"115740052-0-20497";"That I'm the one you love. It's obvious."
"115740052-0-20498";"What?"
"115740052-0-20499";"It is not. Surely you love me, Arlie. Tell her!"
"115740052-0-20500";"I … I … oh, please don't make me do this!"
"115740052-0-20501";"Oh! Arlie, we were only having a bit of fun!"
"115740052-0-20502";"You don't really have to choose between us!"
"115740052-0-20503";"Not right away, at any rate."
"115740052-0-20504";"Federic!"
"115740052-0-20505";"Well, she is going to have to choose, sometime!"
"115740052-0-20506";"Arlie … I know this is sudden, but I'm leaving for <<1>>."
"115740052-0-20507";"What? But why?"
"115740052-0-20508";"I've learned all I can, here. If these last few days have taught me anything, it's that I must learn to stand on my own."
"115740052-0-20509";"I … I think I understand. But <<1>> … you will always have a place, here."
"115740052-0-20510";"Thank you."
"115740052-0-20511";"Baroness … I know you are angry with me, but I have always thought of you as a mother. I will try to do you proud."
"115740052-0-20512";"<<1>>, I may have … overreacted. Know that I am sorry for what happened. I should have listened to Allan."
"115740052-0-20513";"Take care of yourselves. I will write when I can."
"115740052-0-20514";"We'll miss you!"
"115740052-0-20515";"And I, you."
"115740052-0-20516";"All right, recruits. Fall in! I want to see the prettiest march to Shornhelm in history!"
"115740052-0-20517";"Arlie. Baroness. I'm leaving."
"115740052-0-20518";"Federic!"
"115740052-0-20519";"But you've just returned!"
"115740052-0-20520";"I know, my love, but please hear me out."
"115740052-0-20521";"I am a weak man. I have no knowledge of combat or the world."
"115740052-0-20522";"If this were to happen again. If raiders were to attack, or one of the Covenant's many enemies … there is nothing I could do to stop them!"
"115740052-0-20523";"I will not be a slave to the whims of fate. When I return … if I return … I will be better able to defend us from the many dangers of this world."
"115740052-0-20524";"Is there nothing I can say to make you stay?"
"115740052-0-20525";"No, my love. I've made up my mind about this."
"115740052-0-20526";"I have truly no say in the matter?"
"115740052-0-20527";"If something happened to you, I would never forgive myself. So I must go."
"115740052-0-20528";"Then go."
"115740052-0-20529";"Take care, my love."
"115740052-0-20530";"Federic …."
"115740052-0-20531";"Arlie. Baroness."
"115740052-0-20532";"<<1>>, what's wrong?"
"115740052-0-20533";"We're … Federic and I …."
"115740052-0-20534";"We're leaving, Arlie."
"115740052-0-20535";"Leaving? But where will you go?"
"115740052-0-20536";"To <<1>>."
"115740052-0-20537";"To seek our fortunes!"
"115740052-0-20538";"But Federic, you've only just arrived! And <<1>> …."
"115740052-0-20539";"It must be done, Arlie. This isn't the place for us. Not for now, anyway."
"115740052-0-20540";"It's time we made our own way in the world."
"115740052-0-20541";"But you're just children!"
"115740052-0-20542";"No, Baroness. We aren't. And it's time we acted it."
"115740052-0-20543";"But that doesn't mean we won't miss you! We'll write!"
"115740052-0-20544";"We will, at that."
"115740052-0-20545";"Then … if there's no changing your minds, I … I suppose this is goodbye."
"115740052-0-20546";"Goodbye, Arlie. Baroness."
"115740052-0-20547";"We'll see you again, some day."
"115740052-0-20548";"Be careful out there!"
"115740052-0-20549";"I grew up in these rooms. They're just as I left them."
"115740052-0-20550";"This might be it …."
"115740052-0-20551";"I know you were only thinking of me, Mother, but I sometimes wonder about your temper."
"115740052-0-20553";"Dark moons! What was that?"
"115740052-0-20554";"Watch after the new recruit, Aelif. Colors would hate it if we lost another one."
"115740052-0-20555";"Yes, yes. Aelif will watch the new blood. Hmmph. Resolutes."
"115740052-0-20556";"All right you lubbers. Time to cast off!"
"115740052-0-20557";"Very well. Attend me. We shall brace this evil together."
"115740052-0-20558";"Good. You've made it to the first stone and the amulet is working. I don't have much time, so listen carefully."
"115740052-0-20559";"You have the aetherial power of another of the Warrior's charges. Good."
"115740052-0-20560";"At last, the amulet contains the aetherial energy of all three of the Warrior's charges."
"115740052-0-20561";"Face me, initiate. Prove your mettle in the Trial of Fire."
"115740052-0-20562";"You have bested me and completed the Trial of Fire. Enter Rahni'Za, initiate, and face the remaining trials."
"115740052-0-20563";"Priests have been imprisoned. You must save them!"
"115740052-0-20564";"The Serpent betrayed us. He poisoned the Warrior's mind and turned him against us."
"115740052-0-20565";"But my hope is that the aetherial energy from the Mundus stones will allow us to weaken the Serpent's grip on the Warrior."
"115740052-0-20566";"The Serpent's followers, the Scaled Court, range all across Craglorn. They found the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-20567";"They weakened the stone with foul magics. I believe that the aetherial power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can restore the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-20568";"Now, hurry. The power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can strengthen the Warrior's Apex Stone and weaken the Serpent's hold."
"115740052-0-20569";"Go to the ruins of Kardala, at the center point from where these stones rest. The Apex Stone lies within."
"115740052-0-20574";"Listen closely. I can't appear for long or the Enemy will see. Erold means well, but he can't accomplish the task ahead. You must do this."
"115740052-0-20575";"Who disturbs the Queen of Flame?"
"115740052-0-20577";"Enter the circle, friend."
"115740052-0-20578";"Stars above, let this new light do your will."
"115740052-0-20579";"Let them always follow where you lead."
"115740052-0-20580";"And bless them to restore those who have fallen from glory. Our missing guardians."
"115740052-0-20581";"You have been accepted by the stars above. You are now one of us."
"115740052-0-20582";"Accept them, oh stars."
"115740052-0-20583";"Oh, please aid them."
"115740052-0-20584";"Oh, please bless them."
"115740052-0-20589";"Activate the Western and Eastern Shrine!"
"115740052-0-20590";"Activate the Temple Altar!"
"115740052-0-20591";"The beast has arrived. To the temple!"
"115740052-0-20592";"You have purged my venom from the Apex Stone. Clever. Too clever for a mortal."
"115740052-0-20593";"She helped you, didn't she? I can smell her fear upon you. No matter. I will find her and consume her in time, just as I have her fellow guardians."
"115740052-0-20594";"Do not think you have succeeded here. The damage remains. The Warrior has fallen from the sky and is trapped in mortal form. He is mine."
"115740052-0-20596";"The arena is the true test of strength! All others are pretenders!"
"115740052-0-20597";"You think to defeat an army of legend? Fools."
"115740052-0-20598";"Titans!"
"115740052-0-20601";"I'm getting back to the mead hall. Come visit if you find the rest of us."
"115740052-0-20602";"Did that work?"
"115740052-0-20603";"I'm sick of this island, Kaleen. I should be in Betnikh, visiting my people."
"115740052-0-20604";"Think, Lambur. How will we get there without a crew?"
"115740052-0-20605";"Finally, home to Betnikh! I've missed my clan."
"115740052-0-20606";"Well then, my dear friend. It's time we try and find some help to continue our research!"
"115740052-0-20607";"To all adventurers of Dragonstar, I seek protection on a most important mission! There will be gold for those who wish to partake."
"115740052-0-20609";"I want to examine the various guardian stones that have become tainted as of late. There has to be some connection with the rebirth of the Yokudan and the corruption we've seen."
"115740052-0-20610";"There's got to be a connection somewhere. I wish to transcribe any energy readings that the sights are giving off. I'll need you to watch over me while I do this."
"115740052-0-20611";"Stay close!"
"115740052-0-20612";"Hold on … something's coming!"
"115740052-0-20613";"Whatever's going on, even the wildlife is going crazy."
"115740052-0-20614";"This is the place. I'll just want to set up some glyphs on either side of this to be able to analyze what's going on here."
"115740052-0-20615";"Seriously? Get ready, we got more company!"
"115740052-0-20616";"These things don't want us getting any where near their little shrine, do they?"
"115740052-0-20617";"There's my brave warrior. As bare-footed as the day I met him! Do you remember anything from last night?"
"115740052-0-20618";"There you are, my sweet! I battled a Hagraven last night. Or was it a mudcrab?"
"115740052-0-20619";"Yes, dear. Of course, dear. And what did I tell you about wearing shoes? You promised you'd put them on whenever you left the lighthouse."
"115740052-0-20620";"Stop the titans from destroying the shrines."
"115740052-0-20621";"Go where the light leads you, my friend, but I must stay here. I'll await your return."
"115740052-0-20622";"The light protect us!"
"115740052-0-20623";"Hear, hear!"
"115740052-0-20624";"Hear, hear!"
"115740052-0-20625";"Puddles! Oh, welcome back you little ball of love!"
"115740052-0-20626";"Puddles, you make me worry so. You can be such a bad guar sometimes."
"115740052-0-20627";"Puddles, no! Bad Puddles! Come back here, you stupid, stupid creature!"
"115740052-0-20628";"Kill the creature. It deserves nothing but our blades."
"115740052-0-20629";"They've found us! Defend yourselves!"
"115740052-0-20630";"You killed our beautiful Lady Lleraya! I'm going to rip out your throat and make you pay for that!"
"115740052-0-20631";"Quiet! I hear something. It's probably that blademaster and his guards!"
"115740052-0-20632";"Now look what you did! Your constant blabbering led them right to us!"
"115740052-0-20633";"Lleraya, you fool! Now less complaining and more killing! We'll deal with your attitude later."
"115740052-0-20634";"How is this my fault? And who died and left you in charge?"
"115740052-0-20635";"The pile of bodies is high enough. Burn them all!"
"115740052-0-20636";"How much gold did you take from my daughter's dowry? How full are your pockets, you snake?"
"115740052-0-20637";"Stop! I yield. I admit defeat. I can't believe you beat me."
"115740052-0-20638";"You know nothing of the Three! ALMSIVI can't save you now!"
"115740052-0-20639";"Come! I must speak with you once more."
"115740052-0-20640";"Grab something to defend yourself. Don't be greedy, we have a lot of prisoners to arm."
"115740052-0-20641";"The Hound is my true consort! You will not interfere!"
"115740052-0-20642";"Wait! You can't start without this!"
"115740052-0-20643";"I'm going to be fine, father. Thanks to this traveler. Can we get me off of this rock now?"
"115740052-0-20644";"There you are! It's about time you got here."
"115740052-0-20645";"I will start the ritual. No doubt the Anka-Ra and their guardians will try to stop me. Be ready."
"115740052-0-20646";"Hey, you're going the wrong way!"
"115740052-0-20647";"Fine. Go ahead and leave. I'll do this myself!"
"115740052-0-20648";"I'm sure glad to see you! I was lost without you."
"115740052-0-20649";"By the Three, this place smells terrible!"
"115740052-0-20650";"You look so pale. No wonder my brother wouldn't let me come by to visit."
"115740052-0-20651";"Don't worry about me. I'll be back on my feet in no time. But what about you? Your brother said that neither of you had taken the curative yet."
"115740052-0-20652";"Uncle, I'm not sure about these Maulborn. And their curative sounds too good to be true. But don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself."
"115740052-0-20653";"Uncle! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-20655";"Grell? Grell, are you in here?"
"115740052-0-20657";"By the Tribunal! Grell!"
"115740052-0-20658";"Poor Grell. What in Oblivion's name happened to him? Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-20659";"Grell, please! We're your friends!"
"115740052-0-20661";"You, peasant! You think yourself clever. Did the filthy cat give you that little bauble? Or did Ayrenn herself get her hands dirty?"
"115740052-0-20662";"Did she really think she could sail home, and we'd all bend a knee? As she invites mongrels and beasts to cavort in our cities? Deluded fool!"
"115740052-0-20663";"No matter. With Mehrunes Dagon's aid, I will dispose of the false queen and rise as true leader to our people! I am the Veiled Queen!"
"115740052-0-20664";"And as this story ends, a more joyful one begins."
"115740052-0-20665";"Take your rightful place in our celebration!"
"115740052-0-20666";"I've said enough—go and be merry!"
"115740052-0-20667";"And good riddance to that. Gwaering, are you hurt?"
"115740052-0-20668";"I'll be fine. Let's not delay the ceremony any longer."
"115740052-0-20669";"Look over there. That's one of the Maulborn. One of the husks must have gotten him."
"115740052-0-20670";"These … things … are making it very hard to concentrate."
"115740052-0-20671";"You must defend me if we hope to finish this ritual!"
"115740052-0-20672";"I don't know if I can keep this up much longer!"
"115740052-0-20673";"By the Three, this place chills me to the bones. Let's see if we can find my brother and then get out of here."
"115740052-0-20674";"Thank the Tribunal you're back. I tried to go deeper into the crypts, but couldn't without you."
"115740052-0-20675";"Poor thing. I don't have the heart to tell her that the curative might not work."
"115740052-0-20676";"All right, then. Now I feel icky all over."
"115740052-0-20677";"Those nix fleas promised they would help. They promised they had a cure!"
"115740052-0-20678";"I don't think we can help these people. The affliction has progressed too far."
"115740052-0-20679";"By the Three! I fear the plague consumes you, brother!"
"115740052-0-20680";"Aerona, what are you doing here? It's not safe!"
"115740052-0-20681";"The Maulborn attacked us, and the afflicted are turning into plague husks. Oh, Dethisam, this is dreadful!"
"115740052-0-20684";"But brother, why are they doing this? I can't see the profit in pretending to have a cure for a plague you're helping to spread."
"115740052-0-20685";"The Maulborn are spreading the plague. For some reason, they want everyone to become afflicted. They're not healers—they're monsters!"
"115740052-0-20686";"The leader of these Maulborn, Nostrum Breva, has been conducting experiments in the nearby chambers. Maybe something in there will shed light upon what they're hoping to accomplish."
"115740052-0-20687";"I'll stay here with my brother. Can you look around the other chambers?"
"115740052-0-20688";"Don't do this, Dethisam. The Serk needs you. I need you."
"115740052-0-20689";"Oh, little sister. The Serk will be fine. And so will you."
"115740052-0-20692";"Damn you, brother! I'm going to miss you. But I'll do as you ask. And you. Meet me outside after you're dealt with these Maulborn bastards."
"115740052-0-20693";"Thank you for letting me end this my way. Aerona will be fine. Now, let me do this before I turn into a damn monster."
"115740052-0-20694";"Dethisam, you s'wit! We're not leaving without you."
"115740052-0-20695";"I hope you know what you're doing. I could become a plague husk at any moment."
"115740052-0-20696";"My decision is final. Besides, you're sick and your judgment can't be trusted. I'll get us out of here while our friend deals with the Maulborn."
"115740052-0-20697";"Children of the forest, these grounds are forbidden to you. I warn you again. Leave now, or suffer the consequences!"
"115740052-0-20698";"We'll defend our new home to the death! Come back here you stony bastard!"
"115740052-0-20699";"An outsider!"
"115740052-0-20700";"Can you believe that Treethane?"
"115740052-0-20701";"Thanks for your help. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some alchemical wizardry to perform."
"115740052-0-20702";"Very well, but my directives will make this difficult."
"115740052-0-20703";"Go. Convince your people to leave. It is your only choice."
"115740052-0-20704";"You shouldn't have done this. I guarantee the clan will want to fight."
"115740052-0-20706";"Nilyne, please! You have to help him. Is he going to be all right?"
"115740052-0-20707";"Have a little patience, Aeron. Dethisam is strong and Nilyne knows what she's doing. He'll be fighting off Lady Hlaalu again in no time!"
"115740052-0-20708";"Quiet, please. I need to concentrate."
"115740052-0-20709";"Orcs! Orcs are attacking the village!"
"115740052-0-20710";"There aren't any holes this way. I'm turning back."
"115740052-0-20711";"That should slow them down. Quickly, we should get to the Clan Holdfast!"
"115740052-0-20712";"We come together once more to choose the next caretaker."
"115740052-0-20713";"The Wilderking entrusted the Fading Tree to us, and this is part of our oath."
"115740052-0-20714";"My time as caretaker nears its end, and the Fading Tree will choose my successor."
"115740052-0-20715";"The Fading Tree chooses Erunor! Erunor, you will be our next caretaker!"
"115740052-0-20716";"Me? The tree picked me? I'm honored! I'll do my best!"
"115740052-0-20717";"All right, we're done here. Pack everything up. We need to regroup with the other Maulborn cadres and deliver this plague to the rest of Deshaan!"
"115740052-0-20718";"The arena is open to challengers! Let the melee begin!"
"115740052-0-20719";"If you wish to begin the trial, you merely need speak to me. You will only get one chance at this."
"115740052-0-20720";"Ready yourselves. The arena is a test of preparation and endurance."
"115740052-0-20721";"The clan voted to stay … and kill the one who betrayed us!"
"115740052-0-20723";"Our friend has done well. I'm not sure this will cure the plague, but it should at least slow down its progress."
"115740052-0-20724";"All right, that's it. Visiting time is over. Everyone out and let my patient rest."
"115740052-0-20725";"You heard the lady. Let's go wait outside."
"115740052-0-20726";"Please, Mother Morrowind! Please help Dethisam get well!"
"115740052-0-20727";"Please, Mother Morrowind! Please help Uncle get well!"
"115740052-0-20728";"Nilyne knows what she's doing. Dethisam will be fine. You'll see."
"115740052-0-20729";"Come, Erunor. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-20730";"Test your knowledge of the art of the blade against me, if you would continue to the trial below."
"115740052-0-20731";"Go into the darkness and may your faith guide your path."
"115740052-0-20732";"I'm happy to say that the suppressant works. It's not a cure, but it should buy me the time I need to find a way to beat the plague."
"115740052-0-20733";"That's wonderful news! If I wasn't worried about spreading the plague, I'd kiss you right on the lips!"
"115740052-0-20734";"Those bastards! Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-20735";"Strike us down, but the Veiled Heritance will always rise again!"
"115740052-0-20736";"Erunor! Cantadir! Oriadess! We're under attack!"
"115740052-0-20737";"What's happening?"
"115740052-0-20738";"We shall bring some, ah, experts to train you. If you pass their tests, you'll never be alone again."
"115740052-0-20739";"What's this? An initiate with the patience, stamina, and strength to best the arena! Come here and speak to me."
"115740052-0-20740";"You have bested the trials and defeated Abelazar. You have earned the name of Sword-Disciple, a name I never expected to confer on anyone ever again."
"115740052-0-20741";"The books were always intended to be about cooperation. You cannot truly learn to master the art of the blade without the help of others. Abelazar charmed us all and made us complicit in our own destruction."
"115740052-0-20742";"I will protect the Wilderking as long as I can, but you must hurry."
"115740052-0-20743";"A remarkable achievement, to see what is beyond seeing. A test of the Sword-Disciple's faith. If only I had seen more clearly the snake that was among us."
"115740052-0-20744";"Let us speak. I can explain what is happening here."
"115740052-0-20745";"Quick! We must defend the village!"
"115740052-0-20746";"I carry the guiding flame. Take me to the braziers so I may light the way."
"115740052-0-20747";"Initiate. With this brazier, you have begun the Trial of Fire. With this trial, you will prove that you are worthy to study among the Sword-Disciples."
"115740052-0-20749";"My blood is not ink. My eyes are my own. My blood is not ink. My eyes are my own."
"115740052-0-20750";"This is it. The tomb I spoke of. My tomb. A resting place of great honor granted to me by Tarish-Zi himself."
"115740052-0-20751";"You see, I am not of this time. Centuries ago, I sought to end the reign of the self-proclaimed emperor, Tarish-Zi, by working secretly from within his royal guard."
"115740052-0-20752";"The presence of this tomb means that I failed in my mission. Witness—my remains beside a royal seal. The seal is what we are seeking. It is one of the keys needed to enter Tarish-Zi's crypt."
"115740052-0-20753";"The last thing I remember before appearing in this time was the sound of a battle horn. Then I heard the voice of the one you call the Celestial Warrior. Tarish-Zi must have heard the same call. It is why we have appeared in this time."
"115740052-0-20754";"There are two more seals to recover, two more tombs of the royal guard. The vanity of Tarish-Zi will serve us well. He had scribes record every conquest, every monument. They will have written about the burial places of all his retainers."
"115740052-0-20755";"In my time, a great library existed in a place called Rahni'Za. If it's still there, the information we need could be inside. Think on what I've told you. If you decide to believe my tale, meet me at the library."
"115740052-0-20756";"Ah, much better."
"115740052-0-20757";"Arise, my children! Attack!"
"115740052-0-20758";"The tome should be here somewhere. Tarish-Zi would have wanted everyone to know of his glorious deeds."
"115740052-0-20759";"Follow the lights up to my shrine. Smite Vaermina's foolish servants as you come."
"115740052-0-20760";"This was once a glorious shrine, but time and these fools have befouled it. Come. Cleanse the shrine and we shall speak."
"115740052-0-20761";"Wait, that's it! Let me see that!"
"115740052-0-20762";"Riza and Tahmin … I know you must be mentioned in here. Ah! Here it is. Both were granted personal burial chambers near the falls to the north. I pray the entrances have not been buried."
"115740052-0-20763";"We should split up to save time. You find Riza and Tahmin's tombs and retrieve their royal seals. I'll go to Tarish-Zi's crypt and scout it out. We need to know what we're facing."
"115740052-0-20764";"When you have the seals, meet me at the crypt. With luck, we can catch Tarish-Zi unawares."
"115740052-0-20765";"Good luck! I'll see you soon."
"115740052-0-20766";"Thank you, mortal. I had my doubts, but it seems the Abbot's faith in you was well-placed. I will watch you more closely from now on."
"115740052-0-20767";"Ha! Well done, mortal. Well done. I don't think Vaermina will dare trouble us again for some time!"
"115740052-0-20768";"Behold the power of the Worm!"
"115740052-0-20769";"What? No. No! I can't control my body!"
"115740052-0-20770";"These Worm Cult gifts shall restore the Reach!"
"115740052-0-20771";"He has me. Don't mourn my fate. End him!"
"115740052-0-20772";"He killed <<1>>. He'll pay with his blood!"
"115740052-0-20773";"Ah, you made it. Good. And with the seals, too, I see. Then we're ready to proceed."
"115740052-0-20774";"The ward is magical in nature. As long as we have the three seals within its vicinity, the door should freely open to us."
"115740052-0-20775";"Follow me, but stay alert."
"115740052-0-20776";"By the Master's Mace, you shall die!"
"115740052-0-20777";"You can't defeat me. I am a servant of the Scaled Court, herald of the Celestial Serpent! This school belongs to him!"
"115740052-0-20778";"What? The mist? This should not be possible!"
"115740052-0-20779";"I'll meet you back at camp."
"115740052-0-20780";"Did you think you could escape this fate, false emperor? Even across the aeons, I find you. And my blade is as sharp as ever, praise Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-20781";"Belkarth is as good a place as any to take respite after our victory. I'm sure you have more questions for me. Find me there if you wish to speak. And well fought!"
"115740052-0-20782";"Fate brought us forward together. We all heard the call to battle. Those poor souls you doomed to a cursed existence will be avenged!"
"115740052-0-20784";"Ah, that'll be sore tomorrow. Let's get away from here before we're seen. I'll try to grab some proper clothes and a weapon. Meet me at the cave known as Buried Sands. There's something I have to retrieve there. I'll explain more when you arrive."
"115740052-0-20785";"You made it. Good. There's an ancient burial chamber at the rear of this cave—that's where we need to go."
"115740052-0-20789";"Here it is. The entrance to the chamber. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-20790";"You can't stop the Maulborn, you fool! We are the cleansing fire that burns across Morrowind!"
"115740052-0-20792";"The relic you hold is called the Skystone Amulet. It will grant you access to the Warrior's Apex Stone—but it is capable of so much more."
"115740052-0-20793";"Go to the Mundus stones of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed. These are the Warrior's charges, whom he has sworn to protect."
"115740052-0-20794";"The Skystone Amulet was designed to capture the aetherial energy of the Mundus stones. You will need that energy for the task ahead. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I've already stayed too long."
"115740052-0-20796";"Don't worry, my lord. I'll make sure you get a dose of the curative."
"115740052-0-20797";"Have any beds become available? My lord is terribly ill and needs to rest."
"115740052-0-20798";"The situation is the same as it was the last time you inquired. You're welcome to remain here, or feel free to move into the next hall for a hot meal and a cool drink."
"115740052-0-20799";"My lord, please. You need to rest!"
"115740052-0-20800";"Did you really thank me? Now I know the sickness has gone to your head!"
"115740052-0-20801";"Nonsense! Exercise and fresh air will do me good. But I do appreciate the care you showed me while I was ill."
"115740052-0-20802";"You. I'm sorry. I was wrong. I tried to stop them .… Watch out. On the balcony. It's Astanya!"
"115740052-0-20803";"Little brother. You're here."
"115740052-0-20804";"Naemon, then … what have they told you?"
"115740052-0-20805";"Please. I must know."
"115740052-0-20806";"Little brother … I would have told you myself, if I could."
"115740052-0-20807";"My Queen. How may I further the Dominion's goals today?"
"115740052-0-20808";"You only call me that when you've done something you regret. Or expect to regret."
"115740052-0-20809";"When you snatched father's crown for yourself, you never once called me ""little brother."" Did you know that?"
"115740052-0-20810";"I heard you declared my wife a traitor. That you ordered Estre's death. Well? She's gone now, isn't she?"
"115740052-0-20811";"No regrets, dear sister. You did what must be done for the glory of the Dominion. How could there be shame in that?"
"115740052-0-20812";"[Queen Ayrenn sighs]"
"115740052-0-20813";"I heard someone say there's been trouble down at Koeglin Village."
"115740052-0-20814";"It's probably just gossip. Koeglin Village is a pretty quiet place. Boring even."
"115740052-0-20815";"I don't know. What if King Fahara'jad sent soldiers there too? Maybe this really is the start of a war."
"115740052-0-20816";"I'm back, Stibbons. Glad to see you haven't run off anywhere."
"115740052-0-20818";"I … am … reborn!"
"115740052-0-20819";"Forgive me. Forgive us all. We are slaves to a vile serpent. Take mercy on us and end our unnatural existence."
"115740052-0-20820";"I feel the snakes writhing inside my head. Is that what brought me here? No matter. They are hungry—and so am I!"
"115740052-0-20822";"You there. Please. Please help us!"
"115740052-0-20823";"Where are you going? Please come back!"
"115740052-0-20825";"Goodbye Mirilir. I sow these seeds in memory of the life we shared. Even as we fade, may others come here and find the same joy we found in the flowers, and in each other. So may our love be renewed … for all eternity."
"115740052-0-20826";"I'll make you pay for taking my daughter's life!"
"115740052-0-20827";"Let the power of the Remnant wash over you!"
"115740052-0-20829";"The Remnant and I are one! Its power flows through me!"
"115740052-0-20830";"I decided you could use my help, after all! And Tzik'nith sends her regards!"
"115740052-0-20831";"They're so beautiful, Hartmin. Do you think they'll last forever?"
"115740052-0-20832";"It's all for us, Mirilir. The forest, the flowers. All of it."
"115740052-0-20833";"Captain! I bring great news!"
"115740052-0-20834";"I'm afraid you have me mistaken …."
"115740052-0-20835";"I stare into the world once more."
"115740052-0-20837";"Go on if you must, but I'm going to remain here. For now, at least."
"115740052-0-20838";"Dethisam? My brother, what happened to you?"
"115740052-0-20839";"This is impossible! No one has been near it!"
"115740052-0-20840";"We've never left this room, I swear!"
"115740052-0-20849";"Did you see that? They attacked us! And for no good reason! Let's find the key and see what the Maulborn are hiding in there."
"115740052-0-20850";"Hey! What are you idiots doing? Do we look like plague husks to you?"
"115740052-0-20851";"Look! It's just like I told you. The Maulborn are using the back gate. Let's see if one of them has the key."
"115740052-0-20863";"You'll not leave here alive."
"115740052-0-20864";"Approach my statue. Speak to me."
"115740052-0-20865";"I'll do what I can to keep any more rifts from opening. Countess, defend me!"
"115740052-0-20866";"My pleasure, Vanus. Who said the Guilds can't work together?"
"115740052-0-20868";"I can't stay in here, adept. Let us speak some more outside."
"115740052-0-20869";"Very authentic! A good black eye short of those ale swilling fetchers, but then you have manners, don't you? Careful. It might give you away."
"115740052-0-20870";"Shada's minions! To my aid!"
"115740052-0-20871";"All I ask … just … make them pay for this …!"
"115740052-0-20872";"I have no fear of death, for the true king is risen!"
"115740052-0-20873";"Even if I fall, Naemon will be my vengeance!"
"115740052-0-20874";"Naemon has the Staff of Magnus! Nothing you can do will stop him!"
"115740052-0-20886";"One must use fire to forge the blade and destroy their enemies!"
"115740052-0-20887";"To forge a fine weapon, one needs heat!"
"115740052-0-20888";"And finally, one must purge the weapon in the water's frost!"
"115740052-0-20889";"Your Majesty! The undead are massing at Driladan Pass! A lich lord commands them, and he wears the royal crest …."
"115740052-0-20890";"Naemon, then … I must beg your indulgence … I cannot speak just now."
"115740052-0-20891";"Please, speak to him at once."
"115740052-0-20892";"Burn them all! The Master will not suffer invaders!"
"115740052-0-20893";"No! You've hurt mother for the last time!"
"115740052-0-20894";"Sir … sir, I … they took him, sir!"
"115740052-0-20895";"If you are leaving the area, I cannot accompany you. I will return to my tent."
"115740052-0-20897";"Hah! Did you see that? I thought I was hallucinating the first time. It's like the spirits of this place are trapped in the past."
"115740052-0-20898";"We must talk. Do not be afraid. I am a friend."
"115740052-0-20899";"It is done. Shada has unleashed the curse. \n\nYou must protect this goblet no matter the cost, my dear friend. My time is near, but the Yokudans can no longer win."
"115740052-0-20900";"What? The Guardians were once living people? Unbelievable."
"115740052-0-20901";"I will stand my ground for seven eternities, if I must."
"115740052-0-20902";"Forgive me, Shada. I have turned to necromancy in order to protect the goblet. Have mercy."
"115740052-0-20903";"Looks like the lovely stone lady here was responsible for all these shambling corpses. An act of desperation to save her city."
"115740052-0-20904";"If only I had not failed to protect the goblet. Maybe we would not be cursed."
"115740052-0-20905";"Your curses will not work on us, witch! We … willl … break … free!"
"115740052-0-20906";"You can't hide! We'll kill these weak minions of yours and find you. You will give us the Water of Life!"
"115740052-0-20907";"Ah, good! I found you! Speak with me a moment, if you would."
"115740052-0-20908";"Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Elden Root, waiting for you!"
"115740052-0-20909";"Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Wayrest, waiting for you!"
"115740052-0-20910";"Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Ebonheart, waiting for you!"
"115740052-0-20911";"The Shehai of a first rank Ansei sank Yokuda. This Warrior's Shehai is beyond first rank."
"115740052-0-20912";"Just need a moment to prepare … this spell has proven very handy. Once saved my life when I came up against a rhyming spirit. She demanded every answer to her questions be answered with a couplet."
"115740052-0-20913";"Just need a moment to prepare … Adept, I don't blame you for choosing as you did. I made the same choice, years ago. I just hope … I thought you were better than that. Now, I hope you remember the look on her face. For all your years."
"115740052-0-20914";"There we go. I'm ready. Call it ""Shalidor's Library of the Mind."" Hah!"
"115740052-0-20915";"There, I'm ready. Call this ""Shalidor's Library of the Mind."""
"115740052-0-20916";"Why did you run off? I was just preparing the portal! Please, return as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-20917";"Thank the stars! I wasn't sure I'd find anyone else out here. Please, I need your help."
"115740052-0-20922";"The books have been gathered and the fires of knowledge shall melt away the barrier."
"115740052-0-20923";"See my newest creation!"
"115740052-0-20924";"Why did you run off? I was just preparing the portal! Please, return to Wayrest as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-20925";"Why did you run off? I was just preparing the portal! Please, return to Mournhold as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-20926";"Then we leave our brother with the truth, flesh-walker."
"115740052-0-20927";"Then we leave our brother with the truth, flesh-walker."
"115740052-0-20928";"Madness! The rot affects you, flesh-walker!"
"115740052-0-20929";"Madness! The rot affects you, flesh-walker!"
"115740052-0-20930";"Don't be a stranger, Adept. Eyevea is another home for you, now, as it is for every Mage in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-20931";"Be sure to come back, Adept. Eyevea is another home for you, now, as it is for every Mage in Tamriel. Valaste would have wanted it this way."
"115740052-0-20932";"Rahni'za will no longer stand for this corruption. The school will protect those true to its cause!"
"115740052-0-20936";"Alexandra stands now inside the coral. She has stolen its heart, and it dies a slow death. We are joined, and I feel its pain as I feel my own."
"115740052-0-20937";"The master calls his disciples. It is time for a new lesson."
"115740052-0-20938";"I fear touching the mind of the coral is not enough. We must merge, body and soul. Alexandra has ripped the heart out of the coral … it may only live if it finds another one."
"115740052-0-20939";"I will not lie. I'm scared of what's to come. But I'm glad that you and Galyn are here with me. Keep the heart safe. Goodbye."
"115740052-0-20941";"We will. Goodbye, old friend."
"115740052-0-20944";"You have also freed those souls that have been trapped under the Scaled Court. For that, I cannot thank you enough."
"115740052-0-20945";"Face me, <<1>>! Friends—activate the shards of Wuuthrad while I occupy the beast!"
"115740052-0-20946";"I will deal with <<1>>. Quickly, the brazier! Use a shard of Wuuthrad!"
"115740052-0-20947";"Get to the brazier and use the shard! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-20948";"The ritual is complete. Thank you. I don't know how long it will hold, but the Anka-Ra will not be able to rise in this place, for now."
"115740052-0-20951";"The healing cloud parts."
"115740052-0-20955";"The Sword-Disciple must be focused, pure of will, and indomitable of spirit. The flames of the Trial of Fire represent these qualities—burning brightly and intensely on the path to Rahni'Za."
"115740052-0-20956";"Just as a crucible burns away impurities, so the Trial of Fire eliminates those who are unworthy to enter Rahni'Za. The last brazier is lit. Kalith the Guardian awaits. Best him and you will overcome the Trial of Fire."
"115740052-0-20959";"This is not the right way. Raz, er … I will remain here in Woodhearth."
"115740052-0-20960";"Unleash our Ra Gada against the intruders! Crush them as we did the Nedes of old!"
"115740052-0-20963";"The master draws his sword."
"115740052-0-20991";"Arise, Anka-Ra. Defend this temple!"
"115740052-0-20992";"To me! Slay the intruders."
"115740052-0-20993";"At last. The seals have been activated and we can enter the temple. But be careful. Who knows what has awoken inside since the Celestials appeared."
"115740052-0-20994";"The Lord of Knowledge. The Prince of Secrets. Magnificent."
"115740052-0-20995";"Hold the line against the Covenant while I complete the ritual."
"115740052-0-20996";"We can't enter the temple until the beams have been activated. We should search the ruins for a way to activate them."
"115740052-0-20997";"Light it, then! Or are you afraid to singe your furry tail?"
"115740052-0-20998";"This one's furry tail caught dinner, or have you forgotten? It is you who wanted to cook the meat!"
"115740052-0-20999";"Welcome, friend! You are welcome to join us by the fire."
"115740052-0-21000";"Oh, if only you could see yourself! You're covered in it!"
"115740052-0-21001";"It's your fault, leaving me behind. Now be quiet! We'll need to find more kindling."
"115740052-0-21002";"Please, stay as long as you wish."
"115740052-0-21003";"Your mother was right. You are entirely out of your element."
"115740052-0-21004";"Don't bring mother into this. You'll break my concentration! Now what were the words? Lume … illume … blast, how do they go again?"
"115740052-0-21005";"Despite all odds, my husband kept the fire going. Join us, if you want."
"115740052-0-21006";"Explain once more why running was the best idea?"
"115740052-0-21007";"Does it matter? If we can't light a simple fire, we may as well head back."
"115740052-0-21008";"Nobody has asked about us, have they? No? Good, good."
"115740052-0-21009";"Rub the sticks together, then build a tinder fort. Wait, or was it …."
"115740052-0-21010";"When you figure it out, write it down so you won't forget the order."
"115740052-0-21011";"Join us, if you care to! The fire is burning strong."
"115740052-0-21012";"Look. The seal activated one of the beams. We should find the other seals."
"115740052-0-21013";"The way the Anka-Ra guard these seals, I wonder if they put them here to begin with."
"115740052-0-21014";"That's the third beam. We should be able to enter the temple now."
"115740052-0-21015";"That's the third beam. We should be able to enter the temple now."
"115740052-0-21016";"Prince of Fate, Lord of Secrets. Your Seeker, Ibrula, has returned to you."
"115740052-0-21017";"Approach me, Seeker."
"115740052-0-21018";"Your offering, my lord. A relic from the Dragontail mountains, covered in runes of an unknown language."
"115740052-0-21019";"Your gift is accepted. Tell your companions to approach me."
"115740052-0-21020";"Hermaeus Mora wants to speak with you. Approach his statue."
"115740052-0-21021";"I'm no warrior. I'll wait over here while you clear out the Anka-Ra."
"115740052-0-21022";"Be careful. That Anka-Ra sentinel looks dangerous."
"115740052-0-21023";"One of the beams should originate near here. Just be wary of the Anka-Ra defenders."
"115740052-0-21024";"At last. The seals have been disabled. We can enter the temple. We must be careful—who knows what has awoken inside since the Celestials appeared."
"115740052-0-21025";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-21026";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-21027";"This is Ealcil, speaking directly to your mind. Find my Psijic projection near the tunnel exit. I know how to stop the Maormer!"
"115740052-0-21032";"The shadows take you!"
"115740052-0-21033";"Darling, how does this dress look?  I'm not too thin, am I? Please be honest with me."
"115740052-0-21034";"No, no … I think you look wonderful, and very thin … very skeletal, which is wh' I like … skeletal.\n\nYour jewelry hangs cute."
"115740052-0-21035";"This crown makes me look stupid. It sits on my ears. My ears are not my best feature."
"115740052-0-21036";"I like the way your crown looks. If you just put it a little straighter, it'll fit perfectly on that perfect little head of yours."
"115740052-0-21037";"Honey, please, we must go see my father. It's been so long."
"115740052-0-21038";"Maraya, I promise you, we'll visit your father as soon as possible … maybe not this year, but next year … for sure."
"115740052-0-21039";"This throne is arguably the most uncomfortable piece of furniture in the kingdom and I get to use it."
"115740052-0-21040";"Darling please, we can have it cushioned if you like."
"115740052-0-21041";"Oh my good little boy here, are you going to come sleep with mama tonight?"
"115740052-0-21042";"I'm sorry darling, but I'm not sleeping with that in the bedchamber."
"115740052-0-21045";"Oh, but he loves to sleep with us. Don't worry, he'll be no trouble at all. Come on, darling. Please."
"115740052-0-21049";"Not far now, Vestige."
"115740052-0-21050";"Come, I will protect you!"
"115740052-0-21060";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-21063";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-21069";"The door's open. Hurry. We have to find Nahlia."
"115740052-0-21070";"I can't go any further with these undead in the way. Come talk to me if you need any information."
"115740052-0-21072";"Your neck isn't worthy of the master's blade. Come—burn in my flame."
"115740052-0-21073";"Thank you for releasing me from the curse. Please, speak to me as you leave this chamber. I don't have much time before my spirit fades."
"115740052-0-21074";"Ah, merciful death. It is good to be in my right mind again. Speak to me before you leave this chamber."
"115740052-0-21075";"What have I become? There can be no forgiveness for what I've done, but speak to me before you leave this chamber and I will try to right the wrongs I've committed."
"115740052-0-21076";"Thank you for freeing me. I was sure I would die here in this cold, wet pit."
"115740052-0-21077";"The waters must remain blessed. Shada wills it!"
"115740052-0-21081";"You found her. She's … she's okay, isn't she?"
"115740052-0-21084";"Nhalan, you speak of treason! Do you want the Yokudans to come here, pillage everything we've built, murder us all? Do you want that?"
"115740052-0-21085";"Once Shada blesses us, no power in the world will stop us."
"115740052-0-21091";"The monarch atronachs command the other atronachs. The weakest of the monarchs, the storm monarch waits inside."
"115740052-0-21092";"Fight the storm monarch. Once it is weakened, I will bind it. \n\nBut if you need any other help, I'm afraid you're out of luck. I have no intention of dying today or any time soon."
"115740052-0-21093";"One second."
"115740052-0-21094";"I think I can make a crack in the ward!"
"115740052-0-21095";"That's … it! The ward is no more. That took everything I had …."
"115740052-0-21097";"Better a quick death to Yokudan steel than a lifetime as slaves to those creatures. We should call on the stars for protection—as our ancestors did—and have nothing to do with these nereids and their sorcery!"
"115740052-0-21098";"I've heard enough. Take him to Shada."
"115740052-0-21101";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-21111";"You must defend the crypts at all costs. The Yokudans must not make it through here until the ritual is complete!"
"115740052-0-21113";"The mortal did well in feeding my killing word. My black edge."
"115740052-0-21114";"This barrier should keep the Yokudans out while we finalize the ritual with Shada. The sacrifice you make by staying behind to guard it is appreciated, Mahvia."
"115740052-0-21115";"Don't thank me. Thank those who offered themselves for my … experiments. The creature they gave life to will protect this barrier for eternity."
"115740052-0-21116";"See that it does. That creature's magic keeps this barrier held in place. It is the only thing that can keep the Yokudans out."
"115740052-0-21117";"We give our flesh, our minds, and our souls to protect this city and its people against the invaders."
"115740052-0-21118";"So as long as this creation of our bodies stands, so too will the ward that protects these crypts. May I meet you in the stars my brothers and sisters."
"115740052-0-21119";"None shall get past our creation!"
"115740052-0-21121";"Help yourself, wretch."
"115740052-0-21122";"With this binding, our pact is sealed. Are you ready to pledge your lives to me and receive in return the strength to drive the invaders from your doors?"
"115740052-0-21123";"I will not permit our people to be slaughtered in their very homes. Do with us what you will, and grant us victory this day!"
"115740052-0-21124";"Then I take your soul and the souls of all those present to seal this oath. So long as these phylacteries lie undisturbed, our oath will remain unbroken and your soul will be at rest."
"115740052-0-21125";"Now, let the waters of this city flow with strength for its people. Let them drink and drive back the Yokudans. \n\nRest well, Zal'ik, and know that today you have saved your people from certain destruction."
"115740052-0-21126";"Finally … this life is over. I can rest now."
"115740052-0-21127";"If you are to go after Shada, you will need to defeat her maiden below who corrupts the water. I … wish you the best."
"115740052-0-21128";"Do not worry, my dear Vhasla. This one will find a way to free you from the horrors you face."
"115740052-0-21129";"Who sent you? It was Nhalan wasn't it? After all these years, he is still a traitor!"
"115740052-0-21130";"You cannot stop me! My strength comes from Shada herself."
"115740052-0-21131";"I saved our people! The Yokudans would have slaughtered them! I alone had the courage to do what was necessary to save us all!"
"115740052-0-21132";"Give yourself to Shada. It is useless to resist."
"115740052-0-21133";"So you're saying the water just … cleared up? On its own?"
"115740052-0-21134";"You said wandering adventurers from the surface came down here. What did you send them to do, Sali'ma?"
"115740052-0-21135";"I wondered if some of the corruption originated from the wings on either side. I merely asked them to investigate."
"115740052-0-21136";"It looks like it worked. Maybe we'll actually find something now."
"115740052-0-21137";"Murderer! Slaughterer of innocents! These people are under my protection! I alone gave them hope! I alone gave them a future! Leave now and I will spare you. Enter, and your fate will be the same as the Yokudans before you!"
"115740052-0-21144";"The waves of the nereids will carry you away!"
"115740052-0-21145";"The water will not let you escape!"
"115740052-0-21146";"Why must you resist us? Let the waters run through you!"
"115740052-0-21147";"Be quick and stay quiet. It's the only certain way to remain alive."
"115740052-0-21148";"You have the energy. Good. I've created magic foci to receive each element."
"115740052-0-21149";"One person must channel on the staff and three others on the foci. This will open the way."
"115740052-0-21150";"Good work. I'll meet you inside."
"115740052-0-21161";"Intruders! They must not reach the Mage!"
"115740052-0-21172";"There's definitely something still active here. I can feel the magicka pulsing in these stones."
"115740052-0-21173";"You defy me then. Very well. I will not allow you to destroy my people. Instead, I will destroy you."
"115740052-0-21174";"The way to me won't be that easy. But continue if you must. My pet awaits you and he's hungry."
"115740052-0-21175";"Even nature itself has joined with me. Why do you resist? Why not join me? I can give you all the power you would ever need, just as I gave power to the people of this city!"
"115740052-0-21176";"Have you ever watched a spider play with its food? It's exhilarating."
"115740052-0-21177";"You kill innocent creatures that only wish to live. Spiders, Nedes, it matters not to you, does it? The thrill of the kill. Just like the Yokudans, you lay waste to everything in your path."
"115740052-0-21178";"Doesn't it gnaw at you? All these years, buried beneath the sands, and suddenly a hole opens and there it is—the lost city! It's no coincidence. There are forces at work that you should fear far more than you fear me."
"115740052-0-21179";"Be careful where you step, mortal. These nereids are my shield maidens. They empower those I protect. They could empower you, if only you would give yourself to me."
"115740052-0-21180";"Those who once walked among the stars now tread upon the ground, destroying everything in their path. Don't you want to defeat them? All you need to do is drink the water …."
"115740052-0-21181";"Murderer! I opened my city to you. I offered you hope and you repay me with destruction! Fine. Then let the destroyer be destroyed!"
"115740052-0-21182";"Your resistance ends here. I will bend you to my will. Make you commander of my armies. Not even the Celestials will stand against us!"
"115740052-0-21183";"Maidens, give me your power and protection!"
"115740052-0-21184";"Taste the power. I promise you will not regret it."
"115740052-0-21185";"No. I will not be defeated. I will devour you!"
"115740052-0-21186";"This one won't let you perish, Saraali!"
"115740052-0-21187";"She does not arouse from her slumber …. What did this one miss?"
"115740052-0-21188";"This one's still bleeding …."
"115740052-0-21189";"Shada is dead! The waters are safe, and so … refreshing.\n\nHurry. Gather the injured for treatment. And let's not forget the ones we've lost."
"115740052-0-21190";"You are no match for the ancient magic of my most powerful servant."
"115740052-0-21191";"And this is why you should inform this Hara of yours immediately. It is urgent that we speak to her."
"115740052-0-21192";"Yes, we are wasting time repeating ourselves to a … lackey."
"115740052-0-21193";"I'm trying to understand what you just told me. There are other versions of you elsewhere in Craglorn?"
"115740052-0-21194";"As we explained—and with exceptional clarity—we are merely aspects of the one you call the Celestial Mage. Even as we stand here, the Serpent seeks to control us all!"
"115740052-0-21195";"Even now he gathers our aspects to use as his own, assembling them into a false Mage who is entirely in his control."
"115740052-0-21196";"Yes, of course. Whatever you say. I'll talk to Hara, but I can't make any promises. The constellations have disappeared from the sky and we have other things to deal with right now."
"115740052-0-21197";"The stars shine before him, pleading for help, and he's too busy looking at the empty sky to realize it."
"115740052-0-21198";"A drink, then, to ease our patience. You, mortal servant, deliver us your finest—what's the word—ale?"
"115740052-0-21199";"Ale? But the brewer serves drinks in the other room …."
"115740052-0-21200";"Quickly, dive to the passageway! We'll follow behind you!"
"115740052-0-21201";"There! In the center! A passage must have opened below the water!"
"115740052-0-21202";"The Scaled One grows stronger. Another part of us has been lost."
"115740052-0-21203";"The Snake eats and eats and never grows full. His hunger is endless."
"115740052-0-21204";"Our time grows short. But the mortal has returned with the Seeker's Sight."
"115740052-0-21205";"Then converse with our helper. If the Serpent continues to feast, no power will be able to stand against him."
"115740052-0-21206";"Hara has finally agreed to see us and we will meet with her soon. Do not delay. The enemy grows strong and time is not on our side."
"115740052-0-21207";"Thank you again. I should check in at the Mages Guild and give my report. We can determine how we want to handle the Staff from there."
"115740052-0-21213";"A strange relic, this Seeker's Sight. It's a compass of sorts, you say?"
"115740052-0-21214";"Well, place it within the star map and let's see what happens."
"115740052-0-21218";"It's working. See how our other aspects appear."
"115740052-0-21219";"Thanks to this relic, we can locate the remaining aspects before the Scaled One."
"115740052-0-21220";"What is that strange one over there? It's different from the others."
"115740052-0-21221";"That's the Lost One. The part of us corrupted and controlled by the Scaled One."
"115740052-0-21222";"Let's not concern ourselves with her just yet. The other aspects are our first priority."
"115740052-0-21223";"Do not worry about me. I can reach the other aspects on my own."
"115740052-0-21224";"If you have other tasks, I suggest you hurry. The Lost One continues to grow in power."
"115740052-0-21225";"Watch yourself as you exit this cave. You resemble food to the residents of this place."
"115740052-0-21226";"When you finish your tasks, meet us back at this winery. We will proceed with our plan from there"
"115740052-0-21230";"You made it. Good. We could not proceed without you."
"115740052-0-21231";"The aspects have been gathered. It is time to confront the Lost One."
"115740052-0-21232";"We know exactly where she hides. At the beginning. At the source of our power."
"115740052-0-21233";"Spineless worms. Did you not think we would come for her? Did you not know you would bring our wrath upon your heads?"
"115740052-0-21234";"The stench of corruption pervades the air. Be wary. A powerful practitioner of dark sorcery is nearby."
"115740052-0-21235";"You're too late. The Apex Stone is ours! The Thief will fall under my master's sway and none will be left to stand against us!"
"115740052-0-21236";"Hah! None can stand before us. We're coming, Hara! Just hold on!"
"115740052-0-21237";"She mentioned another Apex Stone. Could it be that the Thief's stone has been hidden here all along?"
"115740052-0-21254";"On your guard, friends. Enemies lie in wait ahead. Scaled Court by the looks of them."
"115740052-0-21255";"The Lost One waits for us. She knows we are coming."
"115740052-0-21256";"I sense her presence. Below. She waits in the shadow of our Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-21257";"Defeat the Lost One and we will do the rest."
"115740052-0-21258";"Do not hold back. If you hesitate or falter, the Lost One will destroy you."
"115740052-0-21263";"Good gods, these High Elves are mad."
"115740052-0-21269";"Monarch of Frost, Monarch of Fire, Monarch of Storms. Rise up from Oblivion and answer my command."
"115740052-0-21285";"The others are near. I can sense them. You think to stop me? I am too strong for you, mortal. I cannot be defeated."
"115740052-0-21286";"Fools! This stone is the source of my strength. You cannot defeat me here."
"115740052-0-21292";"Lost One. Surrender yourself. Shake off the Serpent's control. You have lost. Join with us of your own free will and we shall be whole again."
"115740052-0-21304";"The Lost One's pull is strong. Hold fast, sisters. We must … resist the Serpent's grip."
"115740052-0-21305";"We have weakened the Lost One, but we are not strong enough to expel the Serpent on our own. You must find us and stop us!"
"115740052-0-21306";"Gods save us if Craglorn falls to these monsters."
"115740052-0-21322";"Hey … If you were going to be a famous thief, what would you call yourself?"
"115740052-0-21323";"Skeeversbane. Like I am now."
"115740052-0-21324";"The Crimson … Claw. Yes?"
"115740052-0-21325";"This is foolish. Good thieves don't pick their own nicknames."
"115740052-0-21326";"Me, I'd want to be the Masked Mongoose. Because mongooses are clever, you know?"
"115740052-0-21329";"Do you ever feel like the dock smell is following you?"
"115740052-0-21330";"This one does. Her nose is very sensitive, too—and it smells so bad!"
"115740052-0-21331";"It's Skeeversbane. The smell, I mean."
"115740052-0-21332";"I can't help it! I have a condition … it's alchemical or something, I swear. I'm cursed."
"115740052-0-21333";"I remember hearing when I was young that this was some sort of pirate port. I don't think that's true anymore."
"115740052-0-21334";"Stop a moment and think about what you just said."
"115740052-0-21335";"What do you mean? Are there pirates around here?"
"115740052-0-21336";"Yes. They are all over the other side of the island, this one knows. She has seen their sails."
"115740052-0-21337";"Even I know that, and I live under a pile of trash and dead skeevers."
"115740052-0-21341";"I wish we had more food. I'm tired of going hungry so often."
"115740052-0-21342";"What I wouldn't give for a nice wheel of mammoth cheese right now …"
"115740052-0-21343";"I'm not hungry at all. You two aren't very good at this, are you?"
"115740052-0-21344";"Sepaea also does not hunger. She knows the places food can be found without cost, you know."
"115740052-0-21345";"Well, if either of you seasoned veterans would care to educate us with your advanced skills, I'd appreciate it."
"115740052-0-21346";"My friend. Are you there?"
"115740052-0-21347";"Not a moment too soon!"
"115740052-0-21348";"A fiery mountain rises from the snake's pit."
"115740052-0-21349";"Be at peace. There are none here to threaten you."
"115740052-0-21351";"This sword will sing a razor song when it draws across the snake's neck."
"115740052-0-21352";"Save your anger. The Serpent's punishment will come, but we must free our mutual friend."
"115740052-0-21354";"A fiery mountain rises from the snake's pit."
"115740052-0-21366";"Speak for yourself."
"115740052-0-21367";"The bookkeeper and the madcap. The sword was saved by peasants?"
"115740052-0-21368";"Use the gem on each stone focus to summon the atronachs."
"115740052-0-21374";"My friend. Are you there?"
"115740052-0-21375";"My thoughts are my own again. Who—oh. You."
"115740052-0-21378";"It has been some time."
"115740052-0-21379";"Not long enough."
"115740052-0-21380";"What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-21385";"Storm clouds have gathered to bathe the snake in lightning."
"115740052-0-21386";"My thoughts are my own again."
"115740052-0-21387";"Then we are all together."
"115740052-0-21388";"What is he doing here?"
"115740052-0-21417";"The Brothers Ilambris—defeated again. A shame Daedra don't stay dead."
"115740052-0-21418";"I don't know how you lot escaped from torture, but it will resume."
"115740052-0-21419";"The battle's begun. Captain needs you topside."
"115740052-0-21422";"Thank you, my friend! See you at the Lass!"
"115740052-0-21434";"I said, ""You are right."" I have words for the snake. Where is he?"
"115740052-0-21435";"Far from here. We will need your strength to reckon with him."
"115740052-0-21436";"To end him, you mean."
"115740052-0-21437";"Would you end the sun for lighting the sky?  His death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. And it will take all of us."
"115740052-0-21438";"Appeal to the soldier for help? All he understands is violence."
"115740052-0-21439";"We need only free him and point him in the Serpent's direction."
"115740052-0-21440";"Make certain he walks in front of us."
"115740052-0-21441";"The book keeper? What need does a sword have for a book keeper?"
"115740052-0-21442";"The Marketplace is ours! They will try to take it back. We need to fortify our defenses and watch for incoming waves of Daedra!"
"115740052-0-21443";"The Mage is competent in ways you and I are not. We will need her to stop the Serpent."
"115740052-0-21444";"One cannot stop the snake. This sword will behead him."
"115740052-0-21445";"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. Would you behead the sun for wronging you?"
"115740052-0-21446";"Yes."
"115740052-0-21447";"Darkness would envelope the land. The seas would freeze."
"115740052-0-21448";"Then this sword would walk the seas, cut by moonlight."
"115740052-0-21450";"What would you cut?"
"115740052-0-21451";"Wait. On your guard! Enemies approach."
"115740052-0-21452";"Nords."
"115740052-0-21453";"These aetherial stones are linked. I see now! Split off and use them both before their power fades!"
"115740052-0-21454";"There would be no Nords. Nor your precious Anka-Ra. Does that sound favorable?"
"115740052-0-21455";"Quickly, before more arrive!"
"115740052-0-21456";"Fascinating! She knew this place was protected by aetherial power! A trap set by a Thief for a … a thief."
"115740052-0-21457";"Hah! We've done it!"
"115740052-0-21458";"Why do I get the feeling this isn't over?"
"115740052-0-21459";"We will not fall here!"
"115740052-0-21460";"No."
"115740052-0-21461";"You always underestimated the will of the true heroes of this world, Malazar! Witness the foreshadowing of your doom!"
"115740052-0-21462";"These mortals will see to it that your chaos is undone. We will reunite the Guardians, and you will be banished once more!"
"115740052-0-21463";"Could it really be…?"
"115740052-0-21464";"The Serpent's death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. Come. Let us \nfree the Mage."
"115740052-0-21465";"Hara… You? All along?"
"115740052-0-21466";"It had to be this way. But the time for deception is ended. Now is the time for action."
"115740052-0-21467";"This one sees a little worm! Come, little worm. We will feast on you."
"115740052-0-21468";"I have eaten bigger bites than you, little morsel."
"115740052-0-21469";"So much delicious magicka. Sweeter than moon-sugar pastries!"
"115740052-0-21470";"I should have eaten Minerva's soul first. I will fix that mistake, when I'm done with you."
"115740052-0-21471";"Be at peace. There are none here to threaten you."
"115740052-0-21472";"How dare you!"
"115740052-0-21473";"We were all saved by the mortals. It is time we helped them in return. Are you ready to do battle? It will take all of us to stop the Serpent."
"115740052-0-21474";"This sword will sing a razor song when it draws across the snake's neck."
"115740052-0-21475";"If we must. The soldier walks where I can see him."
"115740052-0-21476";"This sword walks where it pleases."
"115740052-0-21477";"Enough. The Serpent has withdrawn to the highlands, where his worshipers protect him. He is guarded against my vision."
"115740052-0-21478";"I have a spell or two that will find him out. And rearrange his insides."
"115740052-0-21479";"This sword will fell all the trees in the land—the snake's head is bound to roll from among them!"
"115740052-0-21480";"We are not to slay the Serpent. We must return home to restore the natural order—the Serpent included."
"115740052-0-21481";"Are we done here?"
"115740052-0-21482";"The cliffracer caws because she adores the sound of her own voice."
"115740052-0-21483";"<Sigh.>"
"115740052-0-21484";"It will take all of us to stop the Serpent. Are you well enough to do battle?"
"115740052-0-21485";"The mountain will do battle enough for all three!"
"115740052-0-21486";"It's just up ahead."
"115740052-0-21487";"And it's under guard. Be careful."
"115740052-0-21488";"All that should concern you is that it counsels me. It convinced me of your betrayal, of the need for the students to pay for their insolence."
"115740052-0-21489";"It has led you astray."
"115740052-0-21490";"Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-21491";"The Daedra have destroyed much of the school."
"115740052-0-21492";"On the contrary, this Blade grants me a clarity I never had in life. And I will have you respect it."
"115740052-0-21493";"The ritual site isn't here. We should keep moving."
"115740052-0-21495";"You were one of them? Mages like you destroyed our city!"
"115740052-0-21496";"Minerva had no part in this. She's only tried to help us, Rithanion. Your fight isn't with her!"
"115740052-0-21497";"No, she's right. I didn't help the Blackcasters, but I didn't stop them either. I must accept some of the blame."
"115740052-0-21498";"Come closer! Time for this one to feast!"
"115740052-0-21499";"You struggle in vain!"
"115740052-0-21500";"This one cannot be defeated!"
"115740052-0-21501";"What? This is … not a good feeling."
"115740052-0-21518";"You won't win, Malazar. I am too strong for you!"
"115740052-0-21519";"Turn back! I will not be responsible for your deaths!"
"115740052-0-21520";"Emissary! What's wrong? And … by the Divines, it's like the insides of a troll!"
"115740052-0-21521";"My magic will destroy you! It rages like a storm through this tower!"
"115740052-0-21522";"You underestimate me, Valla. I have more tricks at my disposal than you could ever imagine."
"115740052-0-21523";"I came to this Archive to contain the damage I could cause. My loss of control blasted all that you see into terrible existence. Why do you persist? Turn back!"
"115740052-0-21524";"I have drawn you out of your Apex Stone and made you vulnerable. I know the power you wield. I am not fool enough to try to swallow you whole. But a piece at a time …."
"115740052-0-21525";"Why are you here? Are you like the Firstmages, seeking power? Mortals are such fools."
"115740052-0-21526";"I will not let you do this. I will stop you!"
"115740052-0-21527";"Protest as you will, but I have already won."
"115740052-0-21528";"I summoned these creatures, raised these obstructions to keep outsiders from reaching me. Stay back!"
"115740052-0-21529";"Everything warps in my presence. Even these, the tower's gardens. They will shield me from you."
"115740052-0-21530";"Mortals. No appreciation or understanding of what I do for them. I warned you to leave, and take no responsibility for what happens."
"115740052-0-21531";"Stop the interlopers! They wish to harm the Learned One!"
"115740052-0-21532";"Now, mortals, you will die."
"115740052-0-21533";"How many foes …."
"115740052-0-21534";"… Can you weather?"
"115740052-0-21535";"And how will you fare …."
"115740052-0-21536";"… When all is said and done?"
"115740052-0-21537";"My creations do not last long …."
"115740052-0-21538";"… and leave destruction in their passing."
"115740052-0-21539";"Your presence infuriates me!"
"115740052-0-21540";"You had the power to lay low the Firstmages. But my magic is beyond theirs."
"115740052-0-21541";"I cannot hold this power back!"
"115740052-0-21542";"My armory has a mind of its own."
"115740052-0-21543";"Too many of 'em. Beware the horn."
"115740052-0-21544";"When I do battle, I do not battle alone!"
"115740052-0-21545";"My magic will tear this realm apart!"
"115740052-0-21548";"Tell Kailstig we failed."
"115740052-0-21549";"The mortals push on. Impressive, but futile."
"115740052-0-21550";"Enough!"
"115740052-0-21551";"I wanted to spare you!"
"115740052-0-21552";"Warn you!"
"115740052-0-21553";"Air and sand can cut like blades in the wind—Ra Kotu will prove this!"
"115740052-0-21554";"This is the end!"
"115740052-0-21555";"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. We will stop him, not murder him."
"115740052-0-21556";"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. My sword will claim his neck."
"115740052-0-21557";"All talk and no action. Fall in behind me. The Serpent will learn his lesson."
"115740052-0-21558";"<sigh.>"
"115740052-0-21559";"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. My sword will claim his neck."
"115740052-0-21560";"The Serpent is already defeated. There are none left to threaten you. Now, come. We must restore the natural order of things."
"115740052-0-21561";"My thoughts are my own again."
"115740052-0-21562";"I have words for the snake. Where is he?"
"115740052-0-21563";"To end him, you mean."
"115740052-0-21564";"Always the pragmatist."
"115740052-0-21565";"It has been some time."
"115740052-0-21566";"Far from here. We will need your strength to reckon with him."
"115740052-0-21567";"Would you end the sun for lighting the sky?  His death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. And it will take all of us."
"115740052-0-21568";"My thoughts are my own again."
"115740052-0-21569";"It has been some time."
"115740052-0-21570";"I have words for the snake. Where is he?"
"115740052-0-21571";"Defeated. Come, now. We must restore the natural order of things."
"115740052-0-21572";"These ""Undaunted"" think themselves warriors? Pathetic."
"115740052-0-21573";"The mortals have come far. But only Ansei of First Rank are allowed in this chamber."
"115740052-0-21574";"My soldiers of sand and steel will strip your flesh."
"115740052-0-21575";"You have come farther than those feeble Undaunted. But you will fall just the same."
"115740052-0-21576";"Interesting. These stones seem to be designed as magical defenses, though they lay dormant now. I wonder what other secrets regarding the Nedes have been lost to time."
"115740052-0-21578";"I see! The aetherial stones are recharged by souls. We can use them to our advantage!"
"115740052-0-21579";"The aetherial stone is active! We can use it against our foe!"
"115740052-0-21580";"I tell you what. You can join him for free. No? Ha. Didn't think so."
"115740052-0-21581";"The aetherial stones! Quickly! They are our only chance here!"
"115740052-0-21582";"Fight on! We need to keep recharging the stones!"
"115740052-0-21584";"The Warrior and his army of old Yokuda claim the citadel of Hel Ra. Leave—and live. Trespass—and die. You have been warned."
"115740052-0-21585";"Their past doesn't matter. The magistrate is in charge now, and <<1>> should remember that."
"115740052-0-21586";"I suppose. But you can only strike a dog so much before it turns on you."
"115740052-0-21587";"If she does, <<1>> gets far worse than the stocks. <<2>> will fall in line. No question."
"115740052-0-21588";"That ship, the Greenhalgh? Have you seen it before?"
"115740052-0-21589";"At the eastern beaches? They aren't with any raiding bands. That's all I know."
"115740052-0-21590";"Send <<1>> to find out what he can. Headman <<2>> has no patience for surprises."
"115740052-0-21596";"Ra Kotu once served the Celestial Mage, but I unlocked her true potential."
"115740052-0-21597";"Surprisingly efficient—for a Thief. Fall in behind me. I will take charge from here on."
"115740052-0-21598";"For the Warrior Celestial, we claim your lives!"
"115740052-0-21599";"You are truly foolish to come farther. This Atronach gives way to no one."
"115740052-0-21600";"Varlariel, mother of mothers, will never allow you to reach me. Turn back before she feasts on your flesh."
"115740052-0-21606";"Nerien'eth will answer for this. He has to."
"115740052-0-21619";"You won't get far. This place is not for mortals."
"115740052-0-21621";"Look at you Banu, all fat and happy on that hill. It's what you always wanted."
"115740052-0-21622";"I'll open the lock on the other side. The study is just a bit farther."
"115740052-0-21624";"This is where I died."
"115740052-0-21625";"My husband's journal mentions a ritual that brought the Daedra, performed out in the rain. Only a few courtyards on the grounds, so let's seek them out."
"115740052-0-21630";"The battle's on! Hurry! They need you topside!"
"115740052-0-21631";"Gods! That's magefire! Clear the deck!"
"115740052-0-21632";"Ah!"
"115740052-0-21633";"There's that magefire again! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-21634";"Boarders! Quick! Defend the ship!"
"115740052-0-21635";"Another One?"
"115740052-0-21636";"Focus! Let's capture those portals!"
"115740052-0-21637";"It's up to you now—go through and find that bastard Pelidil."
"115740052-0-21638";"A guardian! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-21639";"Mara's crotch! They've summoned a gods-damned Sea Serpent!"
"115740052-0-21640";"It's spitting poison! Stay clear!"
"115740052-0-21641";"Quickly! To the ballista!"
"115740052-0-21642";"The bedroom is open! Follow as you can!"
"115740052-0-21643";"Stuck him good that time!"
"115740052-0-21644";"Haha! The Serpent-Slayer! You saved the day!"
"115740052-0-21645";"Hurray!"
"115740052-0-21646";"We taught those bastards a lesson, didn't we?"
"115740052-0-21647";"Protect Pelidil!"
"115740052-0-21654";"We've got to keep moving."
"115740052-0-21655";"Let's get in the fight."
"115740052-0-21714";"This was our bedroom. We used to store our adventuring relics here."
"115740052-0-21715";"It's warded. Quite a defense for such a small room. There must be a way to open it—and these statues didn't used to be here."
"115740052-0-21726";"The tower ahead is not meant for mortal eyes. Turn back, or perish."
"115740052-0-21727";"There's no ritual site here. Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-21728";"You're formidable. Perhaps we have a chance at this. Let me take my students out of the Daedra's reach."
"115740052-0-21729";"I think you will be most impressed, Emissary. Our little island has many unique and appealing features."
"115740052-0-21730";"Walk with me, my new friend. Come and taste the sweet fruit that is Cybiades."
"115740052-0-21744";"Look at our island, Emissary! Is it not beautiful? Night or day, rain or sun, the isle shines like a beacon on the water."
"115740052-0-21745";"Built upon the grand ruins of the past, we now look to the future as proud citizens of the Covenant."
"115740052-0-21761";"Ho there, watchwoman! This is the emissary of our King Faharajad. It's a pleasure just to feel the reflected light of His Majesty, is it not?"
"115740052-0-21762";"Ah, yes. Yes it is. My respects to His Majesty, emissary."
"115740052-0-21763";"And where do you think you're going?"
"115740052-0-21764";"Fool! You will never escape my realm."
"115740052-0-21765";"Pitiful worms. You are mine, now. You cannot escape."
"115740052-0-21766";"I will soon draw your world to mine. My dark anchors will see to that!"
"115740052-0-21767";"The dead rise at my command. Cracked fingers will rend your flesh!"
"115740052-0-21768";"Colossus of bone, rise! Tear these creatures asunder!"
"115740052-0-21769";"We will see each other again, soon."
"115740052-0-21770";"The mortal thinks it can defy me. Futile. Soon your world will be in my chains."
"115740052-0-21771";"Your mortal magic will not save you, ""Prophet."" You cannot escape."
"115740052-0-21772";"What? What is happening?"
"115740052-0-21773";"No! You will not escape. Coldharbour does not release its grasp!"
"115740052-0-21774";"Raaaaaaaaaahhhhh!"
"115740052-0-21778";"Another group enters the Arena! Are they brave or foolish? Perhaps a bit of both? Step forward and let's find out, shall we?"
"115740052-0-21779";"We have new challengers! Will they survive the competition, or will their blood decorate the floor of our grand Arena?"
"115740052-0-21781";"It's like … it's like a fog has lifted from inside my mind. Adept, I don't know what to say. You've saved me from a fate worse than death."
"115740052-0-21782";"Hmm? What's going on over there?"
"115740052-0-21783";"Guards! What is the meaning of this?"
"115740052-0-21784";"Emissary, I can assure you … this is not the norm under my watch. These guards will be severely punished! Come, let us keep walking. Let us put these fools behind us."
"115740052-0-21785";"Ready or not, the battle is about to begin! For those of you who bet gold on the newcomers, you have my sympathy."
"115740052-0-21786";"You drunkards! Cease this immediately! Return to the barracks!"
"115740052-0-21787";"Ahem. Moving on. As you can see, we've built a great deal here in just a short amount of time."
"115740052-0-21788";"These houses are constructed so well … all for future luminaries of the Covenant. Or associates of our Headman Cosh. But in the meantime, we allow our well-paid workers to live in these fine buildings."
"115740052-0-21789";"Help! Thief! Thieves in Abah's Landing!"
"115740052-0-21800";"My … my lord Takheem! What's wrong?"
"115740052-0-21801";"I'll tell you what's wrong, Banu! My pendant is gone! The Eye of Isari! It's been in my family for generations! Thieves are running rampant in your town, Magistrate. What are you going to do about it?"
"115740052-0-21802";"A thousand pardons, my lord! I will look into it personally. I'll speak with Captain Addin. Rest assured, your pendant will be returned quickly."
"115740052-0-21803";"Open the gate! And let the guar know that fresh meat will be available shortly!"
"115740052-0-21804";"You had better, Banu. Or Headman Cosh will hear of this."
"115740052-0-21805";"Emissary, a thousand pardons to you. I wished only to show you the best of Abah's Landing, and you have seen but the worst. Let us cut this short, for now."
"115740052-0-21806";"If you would, return to my manse. I will confer with Captain Addin about the situation, and see to you as soon as I can. Ask one of my servants to serve you my favorite Alik'r vintage. Blessings of Tall Papa be upon you, Emissary."
"115740052-0-21807";"Addin will pay for this. I'll not look the fool in front of Cosh."
"115740052-0-21808";"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Bastards!"
"115740052-0-21811";"Let loose the combatants! This is the Dragonstar Arena, and the games have begun!"
"115740052-0-21814";"Too late, fool. The Arena will run slick with blood!"
"115740052-0-21816";"It looks like we've stopped them for now. Take a breather, shore up our defenses!"
"115740052-0-21823";"Good to see you too,Numih. Try not to let the grape go to your head."
"115740052-0-21824";"I think you're right, Tasaba. The new fish is just what we've been looking for."
"115740052-0-21825";"Leave the students be! I'm the one you want!"
"115740052-0-21826";"I wish I could be there to see that little toad dancing with the snake."
"115740052-0-21828";"You are not yourself, Nerien'eth—let me help you."
"115740052-0-21829";"Wait!"
"115740052-0-21861";"This way! Whatever he keeps in here now, it's well-guarded."
"115740052-0-21866";"Leave those souls—kill the intruders!"
"115740052-0-21942";"We're going to open you up. Find some chains to hang your innards."
"115740052-0-21943";"Even if you defeat me, you won't get far. This place is not for mortals."
"115740052-0-21961";"Nerien'eth. That blade you wield. How did you come upon it?"
"115740052-0-21978";"A portal! This must be the ritual site—where the Daedra are coming through. And where Nerien'eth is waiting."
"115740052-0-21979";"We'll meet on the other side. Be wary."
"115740052-0-21980";"Nerien'eth. Cease this madness. My friends have defeated your horde. Lay down your blade."
"115740052-0-21988";"The Blade hungers for you—for the connection between us. And I give it gladly!"
"115740052-0-21989";"The blade! I can hear the whispers from it. By the Divines—so many lives."
"115740052-0-21990";"You so love the sound of your own voice. Couldn't you see the Blade wanted you here all along?"
"115740052-0-21996";"Never has the whispering from that blade been so … pronounced."
"115740052-0-21997";"You're the Daedric fiend that created it, aren't you? That weapon must never again be allowed to influence mortals."
"115740052-0-21998";"It has hurt you, has it not? Perhaps you could destroy it. Disable it. I could help you."
"115740052-0-21999";"You think I trust you, the one who twisted my husband, murdered my students? I will send the blade away, and I will do so on my own terms—no matter the cost. It will travel far, ever slipping from the hands that desire it. This cannot happen again."
"115740052-0-22000";"The Blade will fight you. It is fully empowered, and it wishes to return home."
"115740052-0-22001";"Never … again!"
"115740052-0-22002";"Mortals never fail to amuse. That edge was fully sharpened, and would have seen great use at my side in the days to come, but Alanwe gave everything to cast it away. There is nothing left to take from her. You and I, however, will meet again."
"115740052-0-22028";"Have you come to claim the Blade, mortal?"
"115740052-0-22029";"The lich will not give it up willingly."
"115740052-0-22030";"Have they come looking for the Blade, brother? How mortal of them."
"115740052-0-22038";"Blasphemer! Your soul is forfeit!"
"115740052-0-22040";"The mortals think they've won."
"115740052-0-22041";"Let's show them how wrong they are, brother."
"115740052-0-22045";"Ah! More meat for the trolls!"
"115740052-0-22047";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-22048";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-22049";"You again! We serve the Whisperer now, but we'll crush you just the same."
"115740052-0-22050";"Our second group of gladiators hail from the proud, the strong, the Fighters Guild! Let us see what type of justice they can convey here on this battlefield!"
"115740052-0-22051";"You think that Blade is yours to touch? It has a master. And he is me."
"115740052-0-22057";"You're trying my patience!"
"115740052-0-22058";"Well, that was unfortunate. Let's try this again … and do remember that people are watching."
"115740052-0-22059";"I'll slice out your tongues!"
"115740052-0-22061";"Are you lost, little goat? Will it scream when my fire licks its flesh?"
"115740052-0-22062";"No! How dare you undo the work of my brood? Kill them!"
"115740052-0-22066";"Take them apart!"
"115740052-0-22071";"The newcomers actually won. I am impressed. And more important, my master will be pleased. Now, head through the gate. More challenges await you!"
"115740052-0-22078";"And now, a round of applause for those proud undead destroyers—the Fighters Guild! Can the newcomers stand against them? I can't wait to find out, can you?"
"115740052-0-22081";"I found it! The source lies deeper inside the ruins. The Nedes truly knew more about this element than anyone alive today."
"115740052-0-22082";"Not yet. Not until I have something tangible to share with Regent Cassipia."
"115740052-0-22083";"Excellent! I'll inform Regent Cassipia at once."
"115740052-0-22084";"We have visitors, Exarch Arnoth."
"115740052-0-22085";"I have experiments to conduct. Deal with our uninvited guests as you see fit."
"115740052-0-22086";"As you command, Exarch Arnoth."
"115740052-0-22089";"I can't stand to look at this any longer."
"115740052-0-22090";"Watch your tone, mortal. Blade or no, only the Whisperer commands me."
"115740052-0-22091";"Can they really contain that thing? Why did it suddenly go berserk?"
"115740052-0-22092";"What are you doing? We can't control this one! It will kill us all, you fools!"
"115740052-0-22120";"Dig, you mongrels, dig! Faster, faster! Exarch Arnoth requires more of the red brittle, and he'll have it even if I have to take it out of your hides!"
"115740052-0-22121";"Finally! A real challenge to get my blood flowing!"
"115740052-0-22122";"You're tougher than you look. Rakmath! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-22123";"Crush these worms, Rakmath! Tear the flesh from their bones!"
"115740052-0-22124";"What useless fools Regent Cassipia has saddled me with. None of them were able to stop you, were they? Very well. Let's test my newfound power!"
"115740052-0-22126";"I hold in my hands the power of creation! And what can create, can also destroy."
"115740052-0-22127";"Like the Celestials before me, I was mortal and am now something more. Regent Cassipia be damned! I will provide all the power the Serpent needs!"
"115740052-0-22128";"You have failed. The lifeblood of Nirn flows through me. Immeasurable. Uncontrollable. I am becoming … more!"
"115740052-0-22129";"My mortal body is a cage. I will not be anchored to it! More! I need more power!"
"115740052-0-22130";"You did it! He's … gone."
"115740052-0-22131";"By the Moons! What happened here?"
"115740052-0-22132";"The Apex Stone! It's sealed the Serpent away!"
"115740052-0-22142";"What is this strange stone?"
"115740052-0-22181";"But his attention will wander elsewhere. We should depart."
"115740052-0-22190";"My child, what are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-22191";"The Celestial Guardians will not save you from me. They won't stop what's coming."
"115740052-0-22198";"It is done."
"115740052-0-22199";"The Serpent could not break this new seal with the blood of a thousand mortals. He will never return to this plane."
"115740052-0-22200";"Even the two of us could not break this new seal on the Stone. The Serpent will never enter this plane, again. Let us depart—the Mage remains in the Serpent's thrall."
"115740052-0-22204";"The Warrior remains in his thrall. Even alone, that one will cause untold peril if left unchecked."
"115740052-0-22205";"Serpent! I've ensured you will never return to this plane. When the Mage and the Warrior are freed from your influence, you will answer for their entrapment."
"115740052-0-22208";"These Iron Orcs are no fun at all! I had such high hopes for the diplomatic method."
"115740052-0-22220";"You really showed up! Of course you did. I know how to pick them."
"115740052-0-22221";"You dare to go on? This pleases my master. Let's hope you continue to please her and she grants you the strength to survive the coming battles."
"115740052-0-22223";"Prepare your weapons. Ready your spells. Oh, and you may want to put on something warm. It's about to get cold in here."
"115740052-0-22225";"Do try not to soil anything during this battle."
"115740052-0-22226";"To advance, you must defeat the champions of this arena—Nords from the coldest region of Skyrim! They love the thrill of battle, the conquest of their enemies, and the taste of mead! But not necessarily in that order."
"115740052-0-22227";"The ferocity in your blood melts the bitter cold of this arena! Well done, mortals! Head through the gate when you're ready. There are many more versions of the Arena waiting to be conquered."
"115740052-0-22240";"Some people would try to find a little heat when the weather turns so chilly. But perhaps freezing to death is part of a strategy I'm just not familiar with."
"115740052-0-22244";"Aww, the fires went out. Well that's going to make things difficult. Better find a way to get those things back on."
"115740052-0-22245";"Now that just looks cold out there. Bet it feels even worse."
"115740052-0-22246";"The trolls! Always forget about the trolls. How the Nords hooked up with those ferocious creatures is beyond me, but they're always good for a few bites!"
"115740052-0-22247";"Every victory elevates you in the eyes of the master, mortals. But how will you fare in the marsh? Can you handle the mud and the bugs and the creatures intent on eating you once they defeat you?"
"115740052-0-22248";"Safa sends more pawns? Very well. Feel the bite of the true Serpent!"
"115740052-0-22249";"Probably your toughest opponent in the marsh will be the nereids. Feisty little darlings! They hate being here and will most definitely take out that hatred on you."
"115740052-0-22250";"Enough with the commentary. Let's get this battle started!"
"115740052-0-22251";"What do you seek, little rat? Don't you fear the Serpent's sharp tooth?"
"115740052-0-22252";"The foul mongrels from the Reach certainly know how to put up a fight. Their magic is strange, their ways are strange, but I love the amount of harm they can inflict when they put their minds to it."
"115740052-0-22253";"Another win, another step closer to a personal audience with my master. Now, through the gate! There's more fun waiting for you in the next arena."
"115740052-0-22254";"Who dares interrupt—? Damn you, Safa! Can I never be free of your fangs?"
"115740052-0-22255";"We must shed Satakal's old skin, brothers and sisters. Only then can we know the true Serpent. Together we will make this leap of faith!"
"115740052-0-22256";"Yes, yes. I see it now. The true Serpent has opened my eyes. Arise, my slave!"
"115740052-0-22257";"The Serpent welcomes you into the fold, Mazaluhad. I trust you brought more recruits?"
"115740052-0-22258";"As we agreed. Safa will be furious, but these disciples are yours to command."
"115740052-0-22261";"No… No! Little Leaf!"
"115740052-0-22262";"You won't leave Sanctum Ophidia alive!"
"115740052-0-22263";"I will not be contained! Do you understand me? Not by the Celestial Guardians. Not by you."
"115740052-0-22264";"No! Not Little Leaf!"
"115740052-0-22272";"I tire of this. You will never leave the inner sanctum alive!"
"115740052-0-22273";"Destroy them."
"115740052-0-22275";"Repel the invaders!"
"115740052-0-22278";"Let's finish this grim business. Then I'll have one less thing to worry about as I work to break the Serpent's hold."
"115740052-0-22279";"It seems the Game Master is slain, so entertainment must be temporarily suspended. \n\nSurvivors may go, but are encouraged to stay. Those who leave will be rounded up later."
"115740052-0-22284";"Mortals. More of you."
"115740052-0-22285";"Your townships embalm the world like a foul crust."
"115740052-0-22286";"Nirn will begin anew when I escape this prison, escape Craglorn."
"115740052-0-22287";"You won't stop what's coming! No one will!"
"115740052-0-22291";"That Mantikora was a mortal construction—puny in the grand scheme."
"115740052-0-22292";"You escaped with your lives against the Mantikora. Why persist?"
"115740052-0-22293";"Your end is imminent. The Stonebreaker will show you."
"115740052-0-22295";"I see troll blood has thinned in the modern era. You will die for this! I promise you!"
"115740052-0-22308";"The trolls have proved useful indeed, Akkra. But are you sure this taskmaster of yours can keep them at heel?"
"115740052-0-22309";"Zagrakh will not disappoint. Just be sure your master remembers his end of the bargain. When all this is over, these lands are ours again. As they should be."
"115740052-0-22310";"Wait. Did you hear that? Ready your spells. We may have some pests to deal with."
"115740052-0-22311";"Cassipia has betrayed us. Protect the progenitor, whatever the cost!"
"115740052-0-22314";"Their forward march persists! Alert the others!"
"115740052-0-22316";"Meet me near Dragonstar after you deal with the wamasu. Its den is close by."
"115740052-0-22318";"I'm sure you're starting to wonder what's going on in here. You'll come to understand—provided you survive!"
"115740052-0-22319";"And now for something a little different. Direct from the lands of the Dark Elves, allow me to present—the slavers of House Dres! Don't let them get their chains on you …."
"115740052-0-22320";"Ah, here they come now."
"115740052-0-22321";"Let's shout ""huzzah!"" for the champions of House Dres! Such grace. Such agility. Think of the pain they're about to inflict! Magnificent!"
"115740052-0-22322";"Well, you know what they say about House Dres? The only way to change a slaver's mind is to drive a sword through it! Ha! That's another victory for the newcomers."
"115740052-0-22338";"Shut up or I will shut you up!"
"115740052-0-22339";"The Serpent will reclaim this land! Render mortal cities to dust! Devour your glittering towers in primeval growth!"
"115740052-0-22340";"To Oblivion with the lot of you, and your damned Serpent."
"115740052-0-22341";"So this was the source of all of Craglorn's troubles. We should guard it carefully. Who knows what it would take to let the Serpent slip free from here, again."
"115740052-0-22342";"I could have taken him."
"115740052-0-22343";"The Serpent's Stone. I never thought I'd live to see it. It's huge."
"115740052-0-22344";"Turuk has seen bigger."
"115740052-0-22345";"It's a marvel of Nedic sorcery. Imagine—the literal essence of all our troubles in Craglorn trapped in one place. A miracle stone."
"115740052-0-22346";"Turuk's stones are an equal miracle. Admittedly not Nedic."
"115740052-0-22347";"You're disgusting."
"115740052-0-22348";"How puzzling! What could those strange tiles be used for? I guess you better figure it out quickly—if you don't want to die, of course!"
"115740052-0-22349";"Seriously. Examine the tiles. Figure out how they work. You don't have a lot of time, and I don't want you to say I didn't warn you."
"115740052-0-22350";"And … time's up! Now the fun begins!"
"115740052-0-22351";"And now, direct from Craglorn's distant past, allow me to introduce … the Anka-Ra! They might be sandy, but that doesn't mean they won't stab you in the face!"
"115740052-0-22352";"Turuk tries."
"115740052-0-22356";"Well, that wasn't what I expected. Perhaps I've underestimated you, after all. I look forward to seeing what you do next."
"115740052-0-22357";"Do you like the lute? I play. A little. Cassi says I'm good, but I think she's just being nice."
"115740052-0-22358";"Ilthag Ironblood! Last chance! Will you please stop training those nasty trolls?"
"115740052-0-22361";"Keep your weapons sheathed. I won't hurt you."
"115740052-0-22362";"When the land was young, it fed on you. Those primordial days will return. And I will end your civilization."
"115740052-0-22367";"Well, that's done! There's just one more thing to take care of—Exarch Braadoth. His throne room is deep inside the mountain, behind the ostentatious door to the north."
"115740052-0-22369";"What a view! It's so beautiful."
"115740052-0-22370";"Gaze upon my most magnificent creation and prove to me the power of your soul. Destroy my Gravelord—if you can."
"115740052-0-22371";"Now that you're here, let's go take care of the runescriber and the armorer."
"115740052-0-22372";"Please, enjoy my collection. The fallen kings are among my most prized possessions."
"115740052-0-22373";"Yes, your soul is powerful indeed! Don't worry about my creation. I can rebuild him."
"115740052-0-22374";"The arrogant kings prove once again that they are not as mighty as they claim. Perhaps I will let you lead my army in their stead."
"115740052-0-22376";"A stick!"
"115740052-0-22377";"How considerate, delivering your soul into my waiting hands. Join me in the depths and I will teach you to embrace death."
"115740052-0-22378";"The foolish Watchers pledged to make sure I never awoke. Now, even they serve me."
"115740052-0-22379";"A brilliant display of savagery and raw power. You will make an excellent commander for my legions."
"115740052-0-22380";"Come closer. Prove the strength of your glorious soul. Reach me, and I will free you from the shackles of your mortal flesh and grant you a superior form."
"115740052-0-22381";"Ah, I forgot to mention. The Nedes warded this door, using their curious brand of soul magic. Allow me to provide the souls you need to proceed."
"115740052-0-22382";"Ah, more guests? Welcome. The others have already started their meal."
"115740052-0-22383";"Foolish mortals! You never learn. To one such as I, death is never the end—it is only the beginning! You have achieved nothing. I will return."
"115740052-0-22384";"As glorious as I expected. Any other soul would be in tatters after all you endured. Yet see how it shines with such brilliant incandescence. I must have it!"
"115740052-0-22385";"You do not stand alone, heroes! By the light of the Divines, I will not suffer your kind to live, foul lich!"
"115740052-0-22386";"Ilthag Ironblood! Will you please stop training those nasty trolls?"
"115740052-0-22387";"Get it? It's a Wood Elf joke!"
"115740052-0-22388";"Not this again, whelp! Away with you!"
"115740052-0-22389";"Oh, well. I tried. The better plan it is."
"115740052-0-22390";"Now the real challenge begins, my honored contestants. My champion has been silenced so that I may congratulate you personally for making it this far. From this point on, you will be pushed to your limits."
"115740052-0-22391";"You compete to earn the honor of becoming my champions! The next challenges will test you in ways you have never imagined."
"115740052-0-22392";"Prove your worth. Continue to impress me. Then, perhaps, I shall allow you to silence that fool of a champion who loves the sound of his own voice—permanently!"
"115740052-0-22393";"I'd be insulted, but I do love the sound of my own voice. Before you can face me, however, more arenas await you. These tiny Wood Elves, for example. They formed the nicest partnership with … what are those things called? Ah, yes. Werewolves!"
"115740052-0-22394";"I don't understand. How can you keep on winning? Why don't you just die? I—argh! Just step through the damn portal!"
"115740052-0-22396";"You will die here, you peasants—do you hear me?"
"115740052-0-22399";"Follow the river to the right. It flows directly past the entrance to the Sanctum."
"115740052-0-22405";"Meet me at the top of the rise. We must find a way to reach this would-be Celestial before she transforms."
"115740052-0-22410";"And so your journey takes you into the depths of my master's domain. Her most-beloved worshipers reside here, including her favorite champions. Those who would gladly sacrifice themselves to become something … more."
"115740052-0-22411";"And when I say sacrifice, I mean that in the literal sense. It's amazing what powers one can acquire when you give yourself to a Daedric Prince."
"115740052-0-22412";"Just wait. You'll soon see what I'm talking about. It'll be glorious! I promise!"
"115740052-0-22413";"Without further ado, here come the Daedra! Powerful in their own right and quite eager to give themselves to our master. You might want to stop that from happening. Yes?"
"115740052-0-22414";"By all the realms of Oblivion, what does it take to kill you? Oh, just step through the gate and go to the next arena already."
"115740052-0-22415";"My eyes are finally clear. My sword will claim the Serpent's neck."
"115740052-0-22416";"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. The three of us will contain him, not end him."
"115740052-0-22417";"Then we should return him to his Apex Stone. And seal it properly. Thrice—if we have to."
"115740052-0-22418";"To the Serpent's Stone, then. Fall in behind me. The snake will learn his lesson."
"115740052-0-22419";"My mind is free of the Serpent's thrall. My sword hungers for his neck."
"115740052-0-22420";"The Serpent has been confined to his Stone. Now, come. There is still the Mage to free from his influence."
"115740052-0-22421";"That is hearty work—for a Thief. Fall in behind me. I will lead us to glory."
"115740052-0-22422";"<Sigh. No text here.>"
"115740052-0-22423";"I'm finally free. My mind is my own, again."
"115740052-0-22424";"At last."
"115740052-0-22425";"The snake—where is he? I'd like to fill him with holes. And I have just the spell to do it."
"115740052-0-22426";"Locked within his Apex Stone. All that's left is to free the Warrior from the Serpent's thrall."
"115740052-0-22427";"Do we have to?"
"115740052-0-22428";"The natural order must be restored. Come."
"115740052-0-22429";"Finally. My mind is my own."
"115740052-0-22430";"It has been too long."
"115740052-0-22431";"You mean not long enough."
"115740052-0-22432";"I forget how quaint you are, Warrior. I have a fiery gift for the snake. Where is he?"
"115740052-0-22433";"He remains out in the world, wreaking havoc in this region."
"115740052-0-22434";"What do you propose we do?"
"115740052-0-22435";"Let us slay him."
"115740052-0-22436";"The natural order must be restored. We contain the Serpent, not end him."
"115740052-0-22437";"Then we should return him to his Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-22438";"Agreed. Let us convene at the Stone."
"115740052-0-22439";"It has been some time."
"115740052-0-22440";"My thoughts are my own again."
"115740052-0-22441";"Not long enough."
"115740052-0-22442";"The Warrior—how quaint. Where is the snake? I owe him a fiery spell for this."
"115740052-0-22443";"Defeated—locked away in his Apex Stone, but his attention will turn elsewhere. We should depart."
"115740052-0-22444";"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. Eyes clear, my sword will claim his neck."
"115740052-0-22445";"The Serpent has been confined to his Apex Stone, and the natural order is restored. But his attention will turn elsewhere. We should depart."
"115740052-0-22446";"Surprisingly efficient. For a Thief and a Mage. Fall in line behind me. I will take charge from here."
"115740052-0-22447";"How gracious of you."
"115740052-0-22448";"We should depart."
"115740052-0-22453";"That rising mist looks dangerous to me. You probably shouldn't let it touch you. Oh, what am I saying? Of course you should! I want to see what the mist does."
"115740052-0-22455";"Kill them! They are not to reach the inner Sanctum!"
"115740052-0-22456";"Burn them, Ozara! Burn them to ash!"
"115740052-0-22462";"There! The first ward is sealed once more. Stay alert! The other three summoning circles are still active!"
"115740052-0-22463";"So far, so good, but we aren't done yet. More of these creatures could appear at any moment. Just keep them away from me awhile longer."
"115740052-0-22464";"One ward remains and then the prisons will be sealed again! Do not falter!"
"115740052-0-22469";"Glorious Serpent! Accept this sacred blood! The blood of your Courtlings!"
"115740052-0-22470";"By the fruit borne from our sacrifice …."
"115740052-0-22471";"The mantikora will serve as your grand vessel!"
"115740052-0-22472";"You have come far—only to die on my sword."
"115740052-0-22473";"That Stone has held me for too long. I will never go back!"
"115740052-0-22474";"No one—nothing—will stop me!"
"115740052-0-22475";"No! The mortals must perish!"
"115740052-0-22478";"Your strength knows no bounds. Rarely have I seen a group that works so well together. The last time must have been, oh, those poor Mages Guild members I found in the Dwemer ruins years ago."
"115740052-0-22479";"How sad that they would fall to the traps the Dwemer left behind. Now they are merely thralls who fight alongside the machinations that they once researched."
"115740052-0-22480";"Let my old toys face off against what may be my newest champions. Show me your true strength!"
"115740052-0-22481";"There's no way this group will get past your defenders, master. But please, let them try. I love a good slaughter!"
"115740052-0-22482";"Hiath, these champions appear to be up for the challenge of facing you. Maybe your time has finally come to an end. But there is still another arena to survive before you go up against my champion."
"115740052-0-22483";"You must think you're really something. Arena after arena, you emerge victorious. But you are nothing. Nothing but lowly insects waiting to be stepped on."
"115740052-0-22484";"I selected the next combatants personally. Even in death, they crave the blood of their enemies. I confess, at this point I almost hope you win—so I can have the pleasure of tearing you limb from limb!"
"115740052-0-22485";"I'll even give you a hint. There's more to this arena than what you see before you. You would do well to remember that."
"115740052-0-22486";"Now, see if you can survive this, little insects! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-22487";"You have done it. You have proven your worth and earned this precious gift. The chance to enter my final arena and face my finest champion."
"115740052-0-22488";"I'm coming for you, Gilraen!"
"115740052-0-22489";"Fingaenion? How in Oblivion did he get here—damn it!"
"115740052-0-22490";"And so the final challenge begins. Those who would represent me as champion now stand in this arena, deep within my realm. Only those who remain standing will receive my highest honor."
"115740052-0-22491";"You know Hiath, so his presence here should come as no surprise. Defeat him and become my new chosen. Lose, and you will be lost and forgotten in the depths of my realm."
"115740052-0-22492";"Oh, this is going to be so much fun."
"115740052-0-22493";"I've been waiting for this moment. You think you're good? You'll never be as good as me. Come now. Don't hold back! It's no fun if you don't try."
"115740052-0-22499";"Gilraen! You look—are you all right?"
"115740052-0-22500";"Never mind that. How about you try not getting yourself killed? The Valkyn and his pet Titan—we're going to slay them before they do the same to us."
"115740052-0-22501";"What did they do to you?"
"115740052-0-22502";"The Daedroth are fighting over your friends' souls. If we're lucky, they'll keep it up."
"115740052-0-22503";"You don't even sound like that bothers you! We have to help them."
"115740052-0-22504";"Use this portal to return to the Observatory in Belkarth. I will meet you there."
"115740052-0-22505";"Let's even the odds a little, shall we?"
"115740052-0-22506";"That's it! Make me fight for it! You haven't even begun to see what I'm capable of."
"115740052-0-22507";"You will not defeat me! No one has ever defeated me!"
"115740052-0-22508";"You beat me? How could this happen?"
"115740052-0-22511";"I am the Exalted Viper! I shall not be denied my place in the sky!"
"115740052-0-22515";"What now? We can't get past that thing."
"115740052-0-22516";"And so that which could not be broken finally shatters. You shall be my newest champions, for you have earned that right."
"115740052-0-22517";"Step into the light that shines at the base of my statue so that I can present you with your rewards."
"115740052-0-22518";"I have had to suffer with that fool of a champion for so long, I despaired ever being able to replace him. But you honor me with your skills and shall ascend to become so much more."
"115740052-0-22519";"Seems Fingaenion's new friends aren't as meek as you lot. And you call yourselves ""Undaunted."""
"115740052-0-22520";"Rise, my champions. Rise and represent me, here and in every realm in existence! In return, I grant you access to my vault. Make use of these items well, warriors. Go out and spread the word of Boethiah!"
"115740052-0-22523";"You seek to put an end to Kulth? Kulth does not think that will work out well for you."
"115740052-0-22524";"You won't stop our army! You can't!"
"115740052-0-22525";"It seeks to test my weapons? My armor? The audacity!"
"115740052-0-22526";"Too late, little goats, too late. The prepared trolls have already been sent to the Exarch."
"115740052-0-22527";"I am the Exalted Viper! I shall not be denied my place in the sky!"
"115740052-0-22530";"I won't let you hurt my Cassi!"
"115740052-0-22531";"Come back to me, Little Leaf."
"115740052-0-22532";"I only sought … to make things … better …."
"115740052-0-22534";"Take up my blade, Titus Valerius. You have earned it. Let its might flow through you and remind you who and what you are—a warrior true!"
"115740052-0-22535";"Kulth eats Wood Elves! Well, that's what I heard. We have to stop him from inscribing trolls with nirncrux."
"115740052-0-22536";"This nirncrux armor is tricky stuff. Without the armorer, the Iron Orcs won't be able to dress up their troll army."
"115740052-0-22540";"Be careful! The Gate's been open for some time. The forest is probably crawling with Daedra!"
"115740052-0-22541";"There you are! The gate is just up ahead. Those three in front of it look … formidable."
"115740052-0-22542";"Quiet, you! It's been a bad day!"
"115740052-0-22543";"Confound it. Where could that Bosmeri woman have gone off to?"
"115740052-0-22544";"I feel stronger. My memories return! Celestial Warrior, hear me! I have done all you have demanded. I have served faithfully. Now, please, send me home."
"115740052-0-22545";"My comrades! My friends. Never have I fought beside more noble heroes. This may be farewell, but I will not forget you. Fight on, and never let your values falter. With you, I know the future is in capable hands."
"115740052-0-22546";"Larisa … beloved. My part in this war is over. I'm coming home."
"115740052-0-22547";"You are my champion, Titus, in whom I am well pleased. Hold tightly to the blade. It will travel with you and serve you well in your own time."
"115740052-0-22548";"Do not fear. The story of Titus Valerius recounts one of the greatest warriors to ever walk the surface of Tamriel. His achievements echo even into the future. Perhaps the same will be true of you."
"115740052-0-22549";"You're here! Let's go. We have to destroy the Sigil Stone in order to close the Oblivion Gate for good. Gilraen says the <<1>> guards it."
"115740052-0-22550";"You forced my hand! We're going to smash you, and then the Sigil Stone."
"115740052-0-22551";"I'll distract him. Fingaenion, you stay here!"
"115740052-0-22552";"When you're ready, meet me at the blacksmithing station."
"115740052-0-22554";"Gilraen, don't you dare die on me now! Be careful!"
"115740052-0-22555";"You did it, the bridge is assembling!"
"115740052-0-22556";"You don't have to come down here for me to hurt you."
"115740052-0-22557";"No! Fingaenion!"
"115740052-0-22558";"Tear his heart out! I'll tend to my husband."
"115740052-0-22559";"You beat the Valkyn? Remind me never to anger you."
"115740052-0-22560";"Is that the Stone up ahead?"
"115740052-0-22561";"It is."
"115740052-0-22562";"Can't believe this is over. I'm glad you're safe."
"115740052-0-22563";"I don't know if any of us are safe. What happened today—this might not be over at all."
"115740052-0-22564";"I know so. I know it in my heart."
"115740052-0-22565";"Ever the optimist. I'm glad you're here, Fin."
"115740052-0-22566";"I never expected to be back. Oblivion had become home."
"115740052-0-22567";"We can go anywhere you want. Just say the word."
"115740052-0-22568";"We were involved in the death of a Valkyn. This ordeal may not be over, Fin."
"115740052-0-22569";"Try to put it out of your mind. We won't be near any Oblivion Gates for a while."
"115740052-0-22570";"Fingaenion? Dammit—hold on!"
"115740052-0-22571";"What is that, up in the sky? It's like no fowl I've ever seen."
"115740052-0-22572";"So Gilraen has brought champions to fight for her. This will not go unanswered!"
"115740052-0-22573";"Do you have a deathwish, mortal wretch? You've been complacent for so long—why seek open war now?"
"115740052-0-22574";"I'm leaving. The deal was my husband and the others would be spared. You violated the Pact, and before the day is done, I will see you dead."
"115740052-0-22575";"A Daedra doesn't know the meaning of that word, my dear. This will be unpleasant."
"115740052-0-22576";"For you."
"115740052-0-22578";"That settles it! On your feet, Brittgerd. It is time to fight!"
"115740052-0-22579";"Sit down, Hogondar! You need a breather!"
"115740052-0-22580";"I have been breathing plenty! I am ready to fight!"
"115740052-0-22581";"You should wait a minute. It is not time."
"115740052-0-22582";"What in the nine holds are you talking about? The Daedra are coming!"
"115740052-0-22583";"Bah! To Sovngarde with you!"
"115740052-0-22584";"Me? How about to Sovngarde with you!"
"115740052-0-22585";"I am very tired."
"115740052-0-22586";"Fine. I will wait."
"115740052-0-22587";"<A long, frustrated yell.>"
"115740052-0-22588";"Shut up!"
"115740052-0-22589";"There's no end to them!"
"115740052-0-22590";"I know! Isn't it great?"
"115740052-0-22591";"To me, champion. We must speak."
"115740052-0-22592";"No!"
"115740052-0-22593";"Spill your guts for me, fiend!"
"115740052-0-22594";"Oh no. Where in Oblivion are we?"
"115740052-0-22595";"Ha! A literal statement!"
"115740052-0-22596";"Shut it. This is Whisper Grove. We're free."
"115740052-0-22598";"This is it. That's the Stone we want. Destroy it, and Oblivion will let us home."
"115740052-0-22599";"This was the worst day of my life. I'm leaving."
"115740052-0-22600";"Enough with the Undaunted. I have been thoroughly daunted."
"115740052-0-22601";"Well. Monynen and I will be here, having all the fun."
"115740052-0-22602";"Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?"
"115740052-0-22604";"Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?"
"115740052-0-22605";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22606";"Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?"
"115740052-0-22608";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22609";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22610";"This is the end of the line. Valkyn Skoria wants you dead."
"115740052-0-22612";"It has the Lord's favor. Do you see what it wears on its belt? If it truly wants to impress us, it should not cheat."
"115740052-0-22613";"They opened the Gate? Are mortals naturally daft?"
"115740052-0-22614";"You would not say that of the one who challenges us. It learned our ways."
"115740052-0-22615";"Ah! I have no woman and no friends, but I have the Undaunted song."
"115740052-0-22616";"We have to keep moving. What're you looking at?"
"115740052-0-22617";"What do you think? It's been months! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-22618";"I'm fine. I got used to it."
"115740052-0-22619";"Got used to what? What did you do? How'd you survive?"
"115740052-0-22620";"I went native. Keep up."
"115740052-0-22621";"I'll try."
"115740052-0-22622";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22623";"Undaunted! Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22624";"Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!"
"115740052-0-22625";"Well. I will be here, having all the fun."
"115740052-0-22626";"I am a lonely man."
"115740052-0-22628";"Sobabe is done with this! Done with the Undaunted."
"115740052-0-22629";"The things I was willing to do to get out of torture—never again."
"115740052-0-22630";"I wasn't meant for this life."
"115740052-0-22631";"Enough with the Undaunted. I have been thoroughly daunted …"
"115740052-0-22632";"Zantan is too old for this."
"115740052-0-22633";"Someone come find me when you need something cut. I'll see you idiots when I see you."
"115740052-0-22634";"I'm going to get a drink. A short vacation from getting stabbed sounds nice."
"115740052-0-22635";"I'm not quitting, but I am going home. Knock on my door in a week."
"115740052-0-22636";"I'll meet you over at the woodworking station."
"115740052-0-22637";"I'll meet you over at the clothing station."
"115740052-0-22639";"You won't end the order. Vigilance eternal!"
"115740052-0-22640";"When you're ready, find me by the cooking fire."
"115740052-0-22641";"You can find me at the enchanting station."
"115740052-0-22642";"When you're ready, meet me at the alchemy station."
"115740052-0-22643";"Kill the intruder! Protect the totem!"
"115740052-0-22644";"I will crush you for that insolence."
"115740052-0-22645";"Are you so eager to die?"
"115740052-0-22646";"You have doomed yourselves. You have no idea what you've done."
"115740052-0-22647";"You don't know what you've done!"
"115740052-0-22648";"You will regret that."
"115740052-0-22649";"Do you wish for death? That shield was protecting this platform!"
"115740052-0-22650";"All right. Here it is. The moment of truth! Here, dugzog! That's a good durzog …."
"115740052-0-22651";"Now sit! Sit, I said! Oh dear …."
"115740052-0-22652";"No! Get away from me! Aaaaugh!"
"115740052-0-22653";"Stupid Dark Elf."
"115740052-0-22656";"Frozen egg. So crunchy. So delicious. Now let's perform the ritual."
"115740052-0-22657";"Let's see. We put the totem and the ancient wing bone in the pot. Then we add the potion."
"115740052-0-22658";"Stand back now. Here comes the good part."
"115740052-0-22659";"Perfect! Just like the book described! I believe the curse has been reversed."
"115740052-0-22681";"I have to say, my prospects have greatly improved since I started worshiping Trinimac."
"115740052-0-22682";"Exactly. No wonder Orc males are always so angry. But enough bitterness. Now is the time for celebration! Harfza and I can finally be together!"
"115740052-0-22683";"Same here. Why should only the chiefs have wives? What a ridiculous tradition!"
"115740052-0-22684";"What? Harfza's mine, you ugly horker! Touch her and I'll rip your throat out."
"115740052-0-22685";"My hunters brought in an entire herd this morning!"
"115740052-0-22686";"We should have enough for the feast then, depending on how hungry the king is."
"115740052-0-22687";"Your hunt-daughter! She told my Kassgra she could marry whoever she wanted, tradition be damned!"
"115740052-0-22688";"Isn't that what the king wants? Toss out the old and in with the new?"
"115740052-0-22690";"Can you imagine the chaos? Sometimes I don't know what the king is thinking!"
"115740052-0-22692";"You don't know the trouble you're causing me by coming here."
"115740052-0-22693";"I guess I'm a fool for trying to save your life!"
"115740052-0-22694";"I had it handled. Your Undaunted are going to die, here!"
"115740052-0-22695";"What was your plan? Come here to live like some kind of extraplanar tramp? For how long?"
"115740052-0-22696";"I gave my life so Whisper Grove could live!"
"115740052-0-22697";"Right. The village comes before family, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-22698";"I can't believe we're having this conversation right now."
"115740052-0-22699";"I will not abide such insolence! I will bury you here!"
"115740052-0-22700";"Your life is forfeit!"
"115740052-0-22701";"I don't think this is the right way."
"115740052-0-22702";"I'm not leaving until Ice-Heart is dead. Come find me when you finish whatever it is you're doing."
"115740052-0-22703";"Glad to see these soldiers alive and well. I hate losing perfectly good troops to the Winterborn."
"115740052-0-22704";"So this is where the little alchemist has been hiding."
"115740052-0-22705";"So another member for our group? Well, the more the merrier, I always say!"
"115740052-0-22707";"One more problem solved! Now let's go take care of Ice-Heart!"
"115740052-0-22708";"If you have any questions before we go in there, now's the time."
"115740052-0-22709";"Ice-Heart and the supplies are still in there. We can't leave yet."
"115740052-0-22713";"The Gravelight Sentry is all that remains between us and the Warden."
"115740052-0-22714";"In my experience, flesh atronachs are tools of the dim-witted. Get moving. The way out is ahead, past the last cell block."
"115740052-0-22715";"No! I will not suffer this!"
"115740052-0-22716";"So the king of the pig children has come to die. Your soldiers failed, Kurog. And so will you."
"115740052-0-22717";"I love it when my enemies mock me. Helps me work up a good rage."
"115740052-0-22721";"Oh! Well, I am not afraid, Grand Forge-Mother. I just wish Bazrag would not hinder us at every turn."
"115740052-0-22724";"Yes, of course, Grand Forge-Mother. Thank you for your time. I shall seek your counsel more often and will visit again soon."
"115740052-0-22726";"They must have built these homes around these devices in order to keep warm."
"115740052-0-22727";"Ow! This is really hot. The metal seems to be warping. Something had made these to heat up beyond what they were meant to."
"115740052-0-22730";"How do you like that, you cold bastard?"
"115740052-0-22731";"Ice-Heart's blade is mine! Now maybe the clans will finally accept my rule."
"115740052-0-22732";"Excellent! This should allow me to control the Dwarven constructs."
"115740052-0-22733";"To arms, my clan mates! Let's show this mad Elf what we think of his Dwarven army!"
"115740052-0-22734";"Don't be alarmed! I bring a gift! These constructs can work your quarry and build the great city of Orsinium."
"115740052-0-22744";"I meant no offense, Chief Bazrag. I only seek to spread Trinimac's good words."
"115740052-0-22745";"We didn't come for a sermon, priestess. I'm just here to see Kurog."
"115740052-0-22746";"Again with these Trinimac lies! Let me show you what Malacath thinks of your stupid words!"
"115740052-0-22747";"Your anger is uncalled for, clan chiefs. Please excuse us, Solgra. I see our champion has returned."
"115740052-0-22749";"Very well Grand Forge-mother. Chief Bazrag, may you remember Trinimac's blood coursing in your veins."
"115740052-0-22750";"You? They pulled you into their madness? How … disappointing."
"115740052-0-22770";"Damn it, Avreg. You don't get it! I want to be an Orcish hero. An Orcish hero wouldn't leave! Not now!"
"115740052-0-22792";"You! Yes, you—champion.\n\nCome speak with me for your reward."
"115740052-0-22800";"You have violated our traditions far enough. Your death will not be swift!"
"115740052-0-22802";"I must go prepare for battle."
"115740052-0-22803";"Shatul, I present your new chief!"
"115740052-0-22824";"Heading back to the Fighters Guild."
"115740052-0-22825";"Heading back to the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-22828";"The intruders are coming, Lord Warden."
"115740052-0-22829";"You've allowed them far enough. Fail here, and I'll feed you to the Abomination!"
"115740052-0-22830";"Did Lyranth think killing the Sculptor would disarm me? His creations live on!"
"115740052-0-22831";"Let's see how you handle the Warden's traps. You'll have the pleasure of meeting him if you survive."
"115740052-0-22834";"The Warden is your final obstacle. You'll find him ahead."
"115740052-0-22835";"My clan suffered it. And now, you will."
"115740052-0-22836";"Have you brought me these mortals as gifts, Lyranth? I'm flattered."
"115740052-0-22837";"Let's see if you're still blushing when we stick your head on a pike."
"115740052-0-22838";"Burn them. The Lord Warden ruled summary execution."
"115740052-0-22839";"Lord Bal frowns on battle amongst his servants, but Lyranth is cunning to have a mortal of your strength fight for her."
"115740052-0-22840";"You stifle growth, natural progress. I will see Nirn freed."
"115740052-0-22841";"I had a champion like you, once, who helped me rip the living essence out of her clan members. Daedric animus make great weapons and armor, you see. Dear Lyranth bears a grudge."
"115740052-0-22842";"Come! Meet Lyranth's clan for yourself! They fit quite comfortably!"
"115740052-0-22843";"Fine, fine! Run, girl, before I change my mind!\n\nNow, the guards will be back any second now! Don't think you can threaten me again!"
"115740052-0-22844";"<Pained scream.>"
"115740052-0-22845";"<Screaming.>"
"115740052-0-22846";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-22848";"The Flesh Sculptor is your next target. Go! His laboratory is just up ahead."
"115740052-0-22849";"Impressive, for insects! All you've done is delay the inevitable!"
"115740052-0-22850";"I'm badly injured. I need to go."
"115740052-0-22851";"You fools are beneath me. My shadows will contend with you. What did Lyranth promise you? Why aid that wretch? There are no spoils here but death. Her clan deserved their fate; their souls will serve me unendingly."
"115740052-0-22852";"Lord Warden, aid me!"
"115740052-0-22853";"Pitiful. Aid the Overfiend, my darling."
"115740052-0-22854";"Ha ha."
"115740052-0-22858";"Your corpses will join with the Abomination."
"115740052-0-22859";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-22860";"Too late, fool. The Arena will run slick with blood!"
"115740052-0-22861";"They must not reach the mother!"
"115740052-0-22874";"If Sellan's organizing a revolt, I'm in. The Red Rooks will pay for what they've done here."
"115740052-0-22875";"I'll find Sellan and join his resistance. But Foreman Blaise has got to die. He's the cruelest Red Rook in the mine."
"115740052-0-22876";"Sellan's got a good plan. I'll go help him."
"115740052-0-22877";"Foreman Blaise has got to die. We'll never break the rest of the Red Rooks while he's still in charge down here."
"115740052-0-22878";"I was on my way to tell Sellan I'd join him when the Red Rooks captured me. It's time to finish what I started."
"115740052-0-22879";"I'll go find Sellan immediately. But you need to do something for me. You need to kill Foreman Blaise. Kill him and we can take back what's ours."
"115740052-0-22894";"We've had our differences, but when have you ever known me to be wrong?"
"115740052-0-22895";"My patience grows thin, Sister."
"115740052-0-22898";"Yes … yes, I suppose that's true. A few more moments, then."
"115740052-0-22899";"As you wish, Empress."
"115740052-0-22907";"The two Thrones belong to Molag Bal, now. Your verdict is death, like the mortals before you."
"115740052-0-22915";"Secure the perimeter!"
"115740052-0-22916";"The Empress should have been the first to set foot in the Palace."
"115740052-0-22917";"We make for the library, and from there, the Elder Scroll!"
"115740052-0-22926";"Hold! The Scroll is here!"
"115740052-0-22927";"Where? There's nothing."
"115740052-0-22928";"This is where I left it. Give me a moment. You'll see."
"115740052-0-22929";"The Elder Scroll!"
"115740052-0-22930";"The Scroll is mine."
"115740052-0-22931";"Kill them all."
"115740052-0-22932";"You underestimate me, wretch!"
"115740052-0-22933";"I had hoped the Scroll was wrong about Clivia. Go! Find the Empress Regent!"
"115740052-0-22938";"The Planemeld is as majestic as it is terrible. I guess it's mostly just terrible."
"115740052-0-22939";"Stay calm! Everything you see is just your mind trying to make sense of merging realities!"
"115740052-0-22940";"This won't end well for you, Your Majesty! Leave the Scroll! Stop this!"
"115740052-0-22941";"Go! The time has come! You must face her, before she slays us all!"
"115740052-0-22942";"General Velarius. I need you to spare me a regiment of your elite."
"115740052-0-22943";"Empress Regent. I arrived as soon as I could. How can the Imperial Legions serve your highness?"
"115740052-0-22969";"After her! The time has come! You must face her, before she slays us all!"
"115740052-0-22970";"Head through the portal! You are destined to face Clivia Tharn."
"115740052-0-22971";"Do you fools still believe you're dealing with Clivia Tharn? She is as lost to you as the White-Gold Tower!"
"115740052-0-22972";"Lord Bal, I have the Elder Scroll! The Planemeld Obverse begins!"
"115740052-0-22973";"Waited as long as I could before opening this portal. The Scroll said I'd be skewered if—never mind."
"115740052-0-22974";"I'll take this. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-22975";"General. I'm certain that you have plenty to do today. How can I help you?"
"115740052-0-22976";"My officers report you requested Legion members directed to your personal service. May I ask why? Do you intend to feed them to the Daedra, as well?"
"115740052-0-22977";"They are necessary. The Waterfront District must be defended."
"115740052-0-22978";"Empress Regent. These troop movements … they're nonsensical."
"115740052-0-22979";"I … of course, but for what purpose? Imperial City is crawling with Daedra!"
"115740052-0-22980";"Just a single regiment. Have them report personally to me. I require the utmost secrecy about this. They will serve in your name."
"115740052-0-22981";"As you wish, Empress Regent."
"115740052-0-22982";"Mind your tone. I already apologized for the incident. I am no strategist, but your men did not die in vain."
"115740052-0-22983";"I won't grant this request."
"115740052-0-22984";"It's an order from your Empress, General."
"115740052-0-22985";"With all due respect …."
"115740052-0-22986";"I know of the personal posting you made, General. Wasn't your daughter injured in a recent attack?"
"115740052-0-22987";"Is that a threat? The healers say we can't risk moving her out of the City and those guards …."
"115740052-0-22988";"Are the only thing keeping the Daedra away from your mansion. But they're also a waste of military resources. I'd be happy to leave them be if you cooperate. Consider it, General."
"115740052-0-22989";"Empress, that District holds no strategic value. You'd be sending these men to die for nothing."
"115740052-0-22990";"Why do you continue to oppose me?"
"115740052-0-22991";"Why do you insist on playing general? I must refuse this, Empress."
"115740052-0-22992";"Then the Elder Council will hear about the extra postings. Your questionable command decisions."
"115740052-0-22993";"Make your threats. My men are loyal to me. I will personally see to it the Legion is done with you. Go back to ruling your Empire, such as it is."
"115740052-0-22994";"This means war, General."
"115740052-0-22995";"Get in line."
"115740052-0-22996";"It's not ready! Don't touch it!"
"115740052-0-22998";"Even if you strike me down, Uzuruz will avenge me."
"115740052-0-22999";"[SCREAMING IN PAIN.]"
"115740052-0-23000";"So, how many outlaws did you bring in last month?"
"115740052-0-23001";"Is everything a competition with you, Orc?"
"115740052-0-23002";"Fifteen. And that's not counting that pair of twin horse thieves that got taken out by a tree branch."
"115740052-0-23003";"Fifteen? Amateur."
"115740052-0-23004";"Amateur? What are you talking about? How many did you bag? Come on, tell me …."
"115740052-0-23005";"So why are you so unhappy?"
"115740052-0-23006";"I would not say I'm unhappy."
"115740052-0-23007";"We have the best job in Tamriel, but you never smile."
"115740052-0-23008";"I don't have time for such trivialities, as long as injustice festers, like a plague on the land. As long as everywhere the weak are preyed upon, their last crumbs stolen from the mouths of their children, who—"
"115740052-0-23009";"All right. Enough already. Now I'm depressed."
"115740052-0-23010";"It was a monster! It tore out Guillaume's throat and disappeared into the river. It was hideous!"
"115740052-0-23011";"Hurry to the docks. Seyne won't last long by herself."
"115740052-0-23012";"Don't stop, now. Keep moving! More guards are on the way!"
"115740052-0-23013";"Whoa, there! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-23014";"The name's Lyris."
"115740052-0-23015";"I hope you've still got some fight left in you. You're going to need it."
"115740052-0-23016";"All right. The good news is, we made it here in one piece and the Prophet looks unharmed."
"115740052-0-23017";"Now, the bad news. It's going to be up to you to keep him safe and get him back to Tamriel. I'm not going with you."
"115740052-0-23021";"There are magical locking devices on either side of the cage. You need to deactivate both of them so I can begin the transfer."
"115740052-0-23022";"Get the Prophet to safety. I'll find my own way back, if I can."
"115740052-0-23023";"Let's get out of here, my friend."
"115740052-0-23024";"Come get some more, you skeeving horkers!"
"115740052-0-23025";"Keep your weapon ready and stay sharp. This place is full of surprises."
"115740052-0-23026";"Greetings, Vestige. Like you, I am a prisoner in this place."
"115740052-0-23027";"You must rescue me. And I, in turn, must rescue you."
"115740052-0-23029";"If you're looking for trouble, you've found it."
"115740052-0-23030";"All right. The good news is, we made it here in one piece and the Prophet looks unharmed."
"115740052-0-23031";"Now, the bad news. It's going to be up to you to keep him safe and get him back to Tamriel. I'm not going with you."
"115740052-0-23033";"Dead. Must have been the runt of the litter."
"115740052-0-23034";"These things fight worse than they smell!"
"115740052-0-23035";"Keep moving! There are more Daedra on the way!"
"115740052-0-23036";"The Prophet!"
"115740052-0-23037";"Well played, friend! Arkay's beard, you're good in a fight!"
"115740052-0-23038";"Cadwell seems to think this Undercroft is a delightful place. That probably means it's a death trap. We'd better be careful."
"115740052-0-23040";"We made it."
"115740052-0-23041";"This place is an abomination. You can almost feel the hatred emanating from every rock."
"115740052-0-23042";"The sooner you get that door open, the sooner we can get out of here."
"115740052-0-23043";"Try to be inconspicuous. We just got free of this place. The last thing we need is to get recaptured."
"115740052-0-23044";"I'll keep watch."
"115740052-0-23045";"We should keep moving."
"115740052-0-23048";"Get away from me!"
"115740052-0-23049";"Don't touch me! I'll kill you, you hear me? I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-23050";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-23052";"Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time! I require your strength!"
"115740052-0-23053";"Let the way be opened! Let these wandering souls return home! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!"
"115740052-0-23054";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-23055";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-23056";"NoSound"
"115740052-0-23057";"There has to be something here!"
"115740052-0-23059";"Grunt!"
"115740052-0-23060";"Friend, may I speak with you before you go?"
"115740052-0-23061";"Deal with any ruffians, if you would! I see more artwork to examine!"
"115740052-0-23062";"Look! Ancient artwork, just like in the antechamber! How exciting!"
"115740052-0-23063";"Most interesting. Might make for a good little story. Ever forward, my fellow adventurer!"
"115740052-0-23064";"That large door must lead to the main burial chamber! I am, after all, quite familiar with this sort of thing."
"115740052-0-23065";"Hmm. I wonder what happens if I press it?"
"115740052-0-23066";"The carving on this pillar! I think it's some sort of switch. How exciting!"
"115740052-0-23067";"That's strange. Usually when I press something, something happens …."
"115740052-0-23068";"Ah, this panel is broken. That must be the key. Yes, I'm sure it is!"
"115740052-0-23069";"Don't mind me. I'll just go and examine that panel!"
"115740052-0-23070";"Oooo, another Nord carving! I must get closer and examine it!"
"115740052-0-23071";"Back to the tomb door! That puzzle lock is as good as solved!"
"115740052-0-23072";"Well done! You're turning out to be one of the best assistants I've ever had! Now press the panels in the proper sequence."
"115740052-0-23073";"Puzzle locks can be tricky. Go ahead and give it another try."
"115740052-0-23074";"Well done, my stalwart assistant! Now we shall reveal the treasures of this ancient tomb!"
"115740052-0-23075";"Look at this place! Amazing! Simply amazing!"
"115740052-0-23076";"A horde of vicious draugr stood between me and the central tomb!"
"115740052-0-23077";"With lightning reflexes, I flung a pair of daggers, dropping two of the foul creatures."
"115740052-0-23078";"Ah, here comes my able apprentice, who distracted the third draugr while I solved the tricky puzzle lock."
"115740052-0-23079";"Have no fear. I'll continue my tale momentarily. I need to speak to my apprentice."
"115740052-0-23080";"My good woman, I can't in good conscience take gold from your clan. In fact, I'm giving some gold to you."
"115740052-0-23081";"What I found in the barrow more than compensates me for my time."
"115740052-0-23082";"I shall return later to finish my tale!"
"115740052-0-23083";"Come to Narsis Dren, you ancient beauty! This will increase my reputation a thousandfold!"
"115740052-0-23086";"Stibbons! I need my gear! The expedition is on again!"
"115740052-0-23087";"Yes, m'lady. I live to serve you."
"115740052-0-23088";"Come now, Stibbons, keep up!"
"115740052-0-23090";"If you don't find the alchemist and destroy those nests, we'll never break this siege!"
"115740052-0-23092";"Right behind you, m'lady. As always."
"115740052-0-23093";"Brr! This cold is unbearable! Stibbons, the firewood!"
"115740052-0-23094";"A fire! Splendid idea, m'lady! I'll just—oh my!"
"115740052-0-23095";"If this is Torug's shrine, where's his body?"
"115740052-0-23096";"M'lady … you need to see this."
"115740052-0-23097";"Build the fire here. I need more light! Maybe there's a hidden door."
"115740052-0-23098";"Lady Clarisse Laurent, I insist you listen to me!"
"115740052-0-23099";"What are you going on about, Stibbons? Can't you see I'm trying to—oh. I suggest a strategic retreat."
"115740052-0-23100";"I wholeheartedly agree, m'lady."
"115740052-0-23101";"You heard him! For the king!"
"115740052-0-23102";"Let's stand back here and let Kharsthun and our friend work in peace, Stibbons."
"115740052-0-23103";"Get down!"
"115740052-0-23104";"Damn it! I lose more soldiers that way!"
"115740052-0-23105";"Voljar's Buzzed Mead! Listen! It actually buzzes! I can't wait to take a swig!"
"115740052-0-23106";"What in the name of Malacath's left tusk? Why are there so many bees? Ahhhh!"
"115740052-0-23107";"Another stanza! Incredible! Torug took the armlet to the very summit! But this word …?"
"115740052-0-23108";"I think they found the third stanza, m'lady!"
"115740052-0-23109";"Quiet, Stibbons! There might still be ogres about! Quickly, Kharsthun. What does it say?"
"115740052-0-23110";"Let me take a look."
"115740052-0-23111";"Torug wasn't pleased that they built his shrine below the summit. He wanted to rest at the top."
"115740052-0-23112";"Does it say anything about the Armlet of Torug?"
"115740052-0-23113";"He carried it to the summit. It says he ""laid Sorrow's … kiss upon it."" Yes, ""zugka."" I'm certain it's ""kiss."""
"115740052-0-23114";"Sorrow's kiss? The same phrase from the fragment! Doesn't that sound so romantic, Stibbons?"
"115740052-0-23115";"Ambassador Rigurt, I have those documents. Is this a good time?"
"115740052-0-23116";"Ah, my sweet Lazdutha! Rigurt has gifts for you, ripe with Orcish affection!"
"115740052-0-23117";"Ambassador Rigurt, this is highly inappropriate! Wait, is that echatere cheese I smell?"
"115740052-0-23118";"""My sweet, my blade, my lady love. Your pommel fits my hand like an armored glove!"""
"115740052-0-23119";"""I promise to never let our attraction dull, even when we've crushed his … skull?"""
"115740052-0-23122";"That, my dearest one, is the smell of Orc love."
"115740052-0-23123";"Very sentimental, m'lady. But are you sure that doesn't say ""zugra?"""
"115740052-0-23124";"Now, Stibbons, really! Leave the translating to the experts. In the meantime, I must speak to our friend."
"115740052-0-23125";"Look, our friends have returned to their senses. I told you they weren't dead, Stibbons."
"115740052-0-23126";"And look! That must be the Armlet of Torug! I refuse to let you go through with your plan, Lady Laurent."
"115740052-0-23127";"Really, Kharsthun, not that again! We clearly have more to discuss. Stibbons, see to our friends."
"115740052-0-23128";"You sided with Kharsthun? After all we've been through?"
"115740052-0-23129";"It's been decided. Torug's relic stays in Torug's shrine."
"115740052-0-23130";"The poor Orcs have to climb up here to see a piece of their heritage? That's positively criminal!"
"115740052-0-23131";"Wait! What's Stibbons doing with the relic!"
"115740052-0-23132";"A little faster, Stibbons. I'm anxious to see what the relic actually does!"
"115740052-0-23133";"But, m'lady, what if I'm not worthy?"
"115740052-0-23134";"Nonsense! We're not afraid of legends and superstitions, are we?"
"115740052-0-23135";"No, m'lady. Of course not. Well, here goes nothing."
"115740052-0-23136";"Oh, Stibbons, what did you do this time?"
"115740052-0-23137";"Hmm. Maybe your man-servant was right. Maybe it does say ""Sorrow's curse."""
"115740052-0-23138";"Careful! Don't crack my man-servant! Honestly, you Orcs approach everything like you're going to war."
"115740052-0-23139";"Perhaps you'd like to carry him, your majesty?"
"115740052-0-23140";"Excellent! Everyone's here!"
"115740052-0-23141";"The time has come. Swear allegiance to me. Orsinium will prosper once the clans unite under my rule."
"115740052-0-23142";"This again, Kurog? Why should we submit to you this time?"
"115740052-0-23143";"Behold! I wield the blade of Ice-Heart! With the help of outsiders, I have vanquished our greatest foe and retrieved the stolen supplies!"
"115740052-0-23144";"The chiefs could not stop the Winterborn! Only I have accomplished that!"
"115740052-0-23145";"You ask much, Kurog. To turn away from Malacath? To abandon our most cherished customs?"
"115740052-0-23146";"Bazrag, my old friend, your outdated ideas will be the death of me."
"115740052-0-23147";"Don't tempt us, Kurog! Our traditions won't bend to the will of an idiot chief who decides to call himself kin—"
"115740052-0-23148";"Idiot? Chief? I am your king! You would all do well to remember that! Now get out of my sight."
"115740052-0-23152";"You embark upon a dangerous path, Kurog. We won't forget this."
"115740052-0-23154";"Over here. Damned knife cut is bleeding, too."
"115740052-0-23155";"Get inside and do what you came here to do!"
"115740052-0-23156";"Tower secure! Good work, outsider!"
"115740052-0-23157";"The Wood Elf is right behind me!"
"115740052-0-23158";"Did you find my dearest Sovelle? Please tell me she's all right!"
"115740052-0-23159";"Take it down a notch, rabbit. Let's hear what our friend has to say."
"115740052-0-23160";"That note from Lord Ethian's father. It isn't proof that the captain's done anything to the ambassador, but it doesn't make me feel all warm and happy."
"115740052-0-23161";"Damn you, Elf! I should kill you where you stand!"
"115740052-0-23162";"What did I say? Please, my friend, make her see reason!"
"115740052-0-23163";"There you are! Skordo found something!"
"115740052-0-23164";"I'll head back to camp. I need to check on the survivors."
"115740052-0-23166";"Fascinating!"
"115740052-0-23167";"Give me a moment and I'll open a portal back to our base camp."
"115740052-0-23168";"A portal? So why did we have to make that harrowing climb?"
"115740052-0-23169";"Teleportation is a delicate business. I can't just open a portal to some place I've never seen."
"115740052-0-23170";"Keep up, Elf! Those harpies aren't going to kill themselves."
"115740052-0-23171";"But there are so … many … stairs …."
"115740052-0-23172";"No time for complaints, either! We have a mission to complete!"
"115740052-0-23173";"All right, all right. Pushy Orc. Just tell me when you want me to make the strike."
"115740052-0-23174";"Look at it burn."
"115740052-0-23175";"Thank you. I should go see my husband."
"115740052-0-23176";"I'm getting really tired of you Orcs trying to leave me be—that's strange, where did the sergeant go?"
"115740052-0-23177";"How typical! Now I know why Orsinium put out that call for help."
"115740052-0-23178";"Well, at least you're still here. Let me know when you want me to light the signal."
"115740052-0-23179";"Two aeries destroyed, no problem! Now let's find the Breton alchemist."
"115740052-0-23180";"Ah! There you are! I had a bit of a scuffle with that odious Captain Henrard, but am none the worse for the ordeal. Now then, Skordo, I need to speak to you. We'll need to alert our contacts in Orsinium as soon as possible."
"115740052-0-23181";"Come, come, follow me. If my suspicions are correct, we shouldn't have any trouble finding what I'm looking for."
"115740052-0-23182";"Keep your eyes open. We're looking for a plant or a root. Something that doesn't appear quite natural."
"115740052-0-23183";"Something odd, out of place. Something like … this!"
"115740052-0-23184";"Sovelle must be at that tower! I'll find her!"
"115740052-0-23186";"I'll use this sapling to test my elixirs. Any others you find, destroy. Then come back here and we can look for the central tree together."
"115740052-0-23187";"Just a moment, dear. I need to thank our intrepid friend here."
"115740052-0-23188";"Whatever is the matter, my dear. You look as if you've seen a ghost."
"115740052-0-23189";"I know you're in there, Henrisa! Where's my wife?"
"115740052-0-23190";"Unhand me, you hag! I am not bird food!"
"115740052-0-23191";"Once again, you prove that I am cursed with the worst father-in-law in Tamriel. I should have known the minute you started organizing our passage. You never organize anything! Your father hired that blackguard, Henrard. He wanted to kill me, Ethian!"
"115740052-0-23193";"It's about time you got here! Do something before I roast up here!"
"115740052-0-23194";"Run back to your father, you pathetic, little man."
"115740052-0-23195";"Free my wife at once, you villain!"
"115740052-0-23196";"I'm going to do your father a favor."
"115740052-0-23200";"I did not see that coming. Go after Henrisa. I'll see what I can do for Lord Ethian."
"115740052-0-23201";"There you are! I was looking all over for—hey, how'd Alinon get up there? That doesn't look very safe."
"115740052-0-23202";"We should get him out of there before he cooks, right?"
"115740052-0-23203";"I knew you were nothing but a filthy Orc lover! I should have gutted you the moment you entered our camp!"
"115740052-0-23204";"A little help, if you please!"
"115740052-0-23205";"I just need to catch my breath. I'll be fine."
"115740052-0-23206";"They tried to roast you! That's not how we define fine where I come from!"
"115740052-0-23207";"Compared to some of my adventures, this was practically a day at the fair!"
"115740052-0-23208";"You have your report, soldier. Return to the siege commander and let's finish off these Winterborn bastards!"
"115740052-0-23210";"Damn it! You two always show up and ruin my fun."
"115740052-0-23211";"Oh, I have not even begun to ruin your fun, my king. But let's leave the pleasantries for later. We have an urgent situation to report."
"115740052-0-23212";"I can never tell when you're joking. Fine. What's so important?"
"115740052-0-23213";"The Trinimac temple has been attacked, my beloved. Malacath devotees have barricaded the doors and taken the priests as hostages."
"115740052-0-23214";"These fanatics dare to attack my city? My people? I'll deal with them personally!"
"115740052-0-23215";"You will do no such thing, my son. After what happened in the throne room, this is undoubtedly a trap."
"115740052-0-23216";"I won't sit by while they attack my city!"
"115740052-0-23217";"This problem requires a personal solution, and I have a perfect idea. Outsider, let us talk."
"115740052-0-23218";"Everyone! Clear the streets and go home! Let the king's soldiers deal with this!"
"115740052-0-23220";"Hey, hero! Over here!"
"115740052-0-23221";"Defend the temple!"
"115740052-0-23222";"On my mark …."
"115740052-0-23223";"Stop, you … thief!"
"115740052-0-23224";"And there goes the other one. Get him!"
"115740052-0-23225";"Lock the priests in the rectory! As soon as Kurog arrives, we kill them all."
"115740052-0-23226";"He watches us … he controls them all! Stop him … shut off the valves, before …."
"115740052-0-23227";"How did you get in here? No matter. You'll be dead in a moment."
"115740052-0-23228";"Chief Bazrag said to leave one of you alive to tell Kurog what happened here. The rest of you? Time to die!"
"115740052-0-23229";"Get her! Don't let her escape!"
"115740052-0-23230";"I'll die before I let you hurt the others!"
"115740052-0-23231";"You … you killed one of my …! Orders be damned! You're going to die for that, priestess."
"115740052-0-23232";"Thank you for that. I thought I could handle them, but the odds got a little overwhelming."
"115740052-0-23233";"What are you doing? We can't let Chief Bazrag deal with the Winterborn by himself!"
"115740052-0-23234";"I didn't come all this way to die, Elf! That isn't what I signed up for!"
"115740052-0-23235";"Damn it! Where are all these Winterborn marauders coming from?"
"115740052-0-23236";"Anyone see where the chief and his warriors went? Anyone?"
"115740052-0-23237";"All I see is death and Ice-Heart's damn Winterborn. A whole lot of Winterborn …."
"115740052-0-23238";"I need to focus first on Emeric's treaty before I can allow myself the luxury of regret. Skordo, I will need you to get to Orsinium as soon as possible."
"115740052-0-23239";"Winks! Where did you get to you bad kitty?"
"115740052-0-23240";"Disappear!"
"115740052-0-23241";"By the First Forge, I'll never get the hang of this!"
"115740052-0-23242";"I don't understand. Why won't it open?"
"115740052-0-23243";"I'm starting to get the hang of this stealth thing. That ogre didn't even know I was there! Hey, what's this place? It's so big!"
"115740052-0-23244";"You found it! This is … Morkuldin."
"115740052-0-23245";"The halls of my ancestors."
"115740052-0-23246";"These statues aren't stone. They're … metal? But there's no rust!"
"115740052-0-23247";"Hmm, markings in the old clan tongue. A lost poem? You should go on ahead. I'll be right there."
"115740052-0-23248";"What's that? What did you find?"
"115740052-0-23249";"That's it, the Hand of Morkul! It's in some sort of … hmm. What is that, a display?"
"115740052-0-23250";"It's nestled in there tight. Of course we can't just take it. Pah!"
"115740052-0-23251";"I'm getting the hang of this. I think. Orcs aren't much for stealth."
"115740052-0-23252";"You did it! Now for ""purest heart."" Hmm …."
"115740052-0-23253";"The old clan word for ""heart"" also means ""blood."" Purest blood … Morkul blood?"
"115740052-0-23254";"My father is Morkul's chief. My blood must work! Just a quick slash of the knife …"
"115740052-0-23255";"Ow … look, it's opening! Like a hand … opening …. Oh. Oh, no."
"115740052-0-23256";"No! Not in my moment of triumph!"
"115740052-0-23257";"You shall not take this from me!"
"115740052-0-23258";"You can't do this! Not after so long!"
"115740052-0-23259";"Help! Is someone out there?"
"115740052-0-23260";"Please help me!"
"115740052-0-23261";"That Riekr chief was very improper! He kept stroking my braid. Are the others all right? I'd better go find them!"
"115740052-0-23262";"An outsider carries the flame? Blasphemy!"
"115740052-0-23263";"Avreg! I found something in those ruins. Something Khajiit!"
"115740052-0-23264";"Avreg! Orgotha! I'm glad you're all right. Did you hear? The Riekr chief is dead!"
"115740052-0-23265";"Keep your heads down and don't move! Chief Bazrag will be back for the rest of us as soon as he can!"
"115740052-0-23266";"Did you see that? I saw a flash. I think there's something over there!"
"115740052-0-23267";"We found them! Leave no Orc alive!"
"115740052-0-23268";"Somebody help us! Please!"
"115740052-0-23269";"There's more of them! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-23270";"They must've gone deeper into the ruins! Follow me!"
"115740052-0-23271";"Thanks for the help. We'll head back to the caravan now. It was stupid to come out here on our own anyway."
"115740052-0-23273";"There are still some of us hiding in the cave near the waterfall! You have to help them, too!"
"115740052-0-23276";"You truly want to help us secure the sacred words of Malacath? Then let us speak, for you cannot find the way on your own."
"115740052-0-23277";"Once again, welcome to Orsinium! I look forward to working with you on this grand endeavor."
"115740052-0-23278";"Is this one of the outsiders who responded to my invitation, high priestess?"
"115740052-0-23279";"Thank you, Solgra. I will speak to the outsider now."
"115740052-0-23280";"Come, outsider. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-23281";"Farewell, mother."
"115740052-0-23282";"Don't worry about me. Find the missing hunters and the Riekr totem. I've got the stealth thing working fine now."
"115740052-0-23283";"Don't worry about me. I've got the stealth thing working perfectly now. Now I just need to find poor Winks."
"115740052-0-23284";"May Jone and Jode shelter you, mother. And may Malacath guide your way."
"115740052-0-23285";"Winks! Where did you run off to, you naughty little cat? Well, I'm glad you're back!"
"115740052-0-23286";"There's a dagger with two moons on the hilt. I'm sure it's another sign!"
"115740052-0-23287";"A riddle. She's playing with her child. Let's search this chamber."
"115740052-0-23288";"Another coffer! She hid them with simple spells. I think I remember playing this game when I was very young."
"115740052-0-23289";"I'll look for more puzzles. And my cat. She's around here somewhere, I just know it."
"115740052-0-23290";"Oh! I forgot. Disappear!"
"115740052-0-23291";"Another note. Maybe it's another riddle?"
"115740052-0-23292";"Look, that vase. Do you think that's a little smiling moon?"
"115740052-0-23293";"There's the scroll. More of my history."
"115740052-0-23294";"Disappear!"
"115740052-0-23295";"Hello! I've been looking all over the city for you!"
"115740052-0-23299";"Come on, the well is this way!"
"115740052-0-23300";"I'll hang back and look around up here a little more while you head into the prison."
"115740052-0-23301";"All right, the rope is secure! Good luck down there. Hope you find the prison and not some nasty sewer or something."
"115740052-0-23305";"Join us or die. It's that simple."
"115740052-0-23307";"First we need to get through the Chamber of Scorn, where we keep the most dangerous prisoners."
"115740052-0-23308";"Chamber's protected by poison gas. If we run into trouble, you'll have to deal with it, what with my injured arm and all."
"115740052-0-23309";"Damn gates! I forgot about them. Blasted engineers always making upgrades …."
"115740052-0-23310";"Once I turn this lever, there's no stopping, so get ready."
"115740052-0-23311";"Turning the first lever … now!"
"115740052-0-23312";"One down. I'll get the next one. Just keep those prisoners away from me!"
"115740052-0-23313";"Good job! But things are about to get more complicated."
"115740052-0-23314";"One more lever to go!"
"115740052-0-23315";"All right, that's done. Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-23316";"About damn time. Ancient ruins full of cultists make my knees hurt."
"115740052-0-23317";"Out of the way, youngster. I can find my own way out."
"115740052-0-23318";"You figured it out. Not bad. Just a little farther and we'll be out of here."
"115740052-0-23319";"Finally! It's good to breathe free air again. Just … give me a moment … to compose myself."
"115740052-0-23320";"No!"
"115740052-0-23321";"Chief Bazrag, lower your weapon. Please. I don't want to loose this arrow, but I will if you don't stand down."
"115740052-0-23322";"Damn it, Wood Elf! Fine. But you might as well put that arrow in my heart, because I won't let you turn me over to Kurog."
"115740052-0-23323";"I know that must have been a difficult decision to make, but thank you."
"115740052-0-23324";"So very, very cold …."
"115740052-0-23325";"Malacath preserve me. Oh Unsulag, I'm so sorry."
"115740052-0-23326";"You made it! Excellent!"
"115740052-0-23327";"Is that the best you can do? My hearth-mother hits harder than that—and she's dead!"
"115740052-0-23328";"You again? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you liked me."
"115740052-0-23329";"Well, that didn't work out very well for you, did it?\n\nTry moving quicker than a horker, would you?"
"115740052-0-23330";"What a terrible choice you had to make. But Trinimac preserve me, thank you for choosing me."
"115740052-0-23331";"No! Oh no!"
"115740052-0-23332";"I hate … the cold …."
"115740052-0-23333";"Poor Gahar. How horrible! But you made the right choice. You'll see."
"115740052-0-23334";"Hey! Over here! Help! Don't let them kill me!"
"115740052-0-23335";"They kept threatening me. Said they were going to throw me in the ice prison."
"115740052-0-23336";"What should I do now? I'm a cook, not a warrior."
"115740052-0-23337";"Did you get a look at that prison? Never seen anything like that in my life."
"115740052-0-23338";"Yeah, but I can't believe we opened up all the cages. It's a madhouse down there."
"115740052-0-23339";"Ah, don't worry. It's far enough beneath the fortress that they'll never be able to crawl up here—even if they manage to make it to the old well."
"115740052-0-23340";"Come on! Now's our chance!"
"115740052-0-23341";"This doesn't look very sturdy …."
"115740052-0-23342";"Ow! Ow! Ow! Damn, those are hot!"
"115740052-0-23343";"Help me, please! This fire, can you put it out? There's some water over by the wall!"
"115740052-0-23344";"Kireth, what did you do that for? You destroyed my sphere!"
"115740052-0-23345";"Wait! Where are you going! Come back, little construct!"
"115740052-0-23346";"You are not worthy of Malacath's glory."
"115740052-0-23347";"We can't just walk into the Vosh Rakh base. That's suicide!"
"115740052-0-23348";"We have to find out what the Vosh Rakh have planned. If we wait for them to strike, it will be too late."
"115740052-0-23349";"Whatever they're planning, it's going to happen soon. They just about told me as much when they threw me into my own prison!"
"115740052-0-23350";"You lied to us, high priestess! You knew who you were sending us to rescue the entire time! This feels like one giant trap and we walked right into it."
"115740052-0-23352";"Ah, you found us. I'm sorry that Eveli is upset, but I did what had to be done. Please, let's talk."
"115740052-0-23353";"You two have your orders. Scout the temple exterior. The others will join you shortly."
"115740052-0-23354";"Hurry! This way!"
"115740052-0-23355";"Praise be to Trinimac! Trinimac hear our prayers!"
"115740052-0-23356";"We are the Vosh Rakh! We are Trinimac's sharp sword!"
"115740052-0-23357";"All will worship Trinimac! All will believe in the path he has placed before us!"
"115740052-0-23358";"<<1>> will head to the Greedy Gut. Meet her there, yes?"
"115740052-0-23362";"Tell me more about this map or things will go very poorly for you. Are you listening? Hello …? \n\nOh. You're dead …. Typical."
"115740052-0-23363";"Did they have to slaughter the best of my flock?"
"115740052-0-23364";"There's the way out! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-23365";"Good to see you made it. The lizard decided to wait outside and keep an eyes on things."
"115740052-0-23366";"The only way to determine what the Vosh Rakh are planning is for us to pass their tests."
"115740052-0-23367";"Stay alert and watch for anything that might help us. We have to find out what they have planned—no matter what."
"115740052-0-23368";"Trinimac, hear our prayer. Guide our weapons and alert us to all dangers. Grant us the courage to complete the trial you place before us."
"115740052-0-23369";"The Gauntlet will push you to your limits, so choose wisely."
"115740052-0-23372";"Don't hold anything back. I won't."
"115740052-0-23373";"I think he found one!"
"115740052-0-23376";"And so the first of Trinimac's chosen have arrived. Approach and demonstrate your devotion."
"115740052-0-23377";"Ah, now I see how you completed the Gauntlet so quickly. Your disguise is not needed here. I know who you are."
"115740052-0-23378";"We've donned the false god's armor. Attacked and killed true believers within a sacred temple. All for the sake of the sacred plan. Will you make that same sacrifice?"
"115740052-0-23379";"You show great courage to stand before us, but what are you truly willing to sacrifice? Are your intentions as pure as ours?"
"115740052-0-23380";"Your final test starts now. Are you here to harm us or to join us? To make the Orsimer stronger than they ever imagined?"
"115740052-0-23381";"Hey, my amulet stopped working! And did they just say something about spilling my blood?"
"115740052-0-23383";"Are you …. Yes, I'm sure you are! I have a message for you!"
"115740052-0-23384";"Maybe we should have left you in there. For all we know, you deserve to be in prison!"
"115740052-0-23385";"I sent you to rescue the chief, Eveli. I wouldn't have done that if I believed he was guilty."
"115740052-0-23386";"Listen to me, Elf. I didn't attack anyone. I left Orsinium and they ambushed me."
"115740052-0-23387";"You're late! The others have already gone inside. Get a move on!"
"115740052-0-23388";"Attack! We are under attack!"
"115740052-0-23389";"Enough! I fight! I win! Archers! Now!"
"115740052-0-23390";"Dig. Seek the Dragonfire Cathedral with pick and spade. Smother, choke, and quench the light. By Molag Bal's will, obey."
"115740052-0-23391";"<<1>>? You have to go! If <<2>> sees you, he'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-23392";"<<1>> is in Orsinium. He sold me his armor before I came to Shatul."
"115740052-0-23393";"No. What have you done?"
"115740052-0-23394";"Shatul must survive. Don't hold back, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-23395";"Malacath favor the victor."
"115740052-0-23399";"Goodbye, Uncle <<1>>."
"115740052-0-23403";"Goodbye, little one."
"115740052-0-23404";"Show us where your loyalty lies! Spill the blood of your ally in Trinimac's name and display your true devotion!"
"115740052-0-23405";"Oh my! You're not considering following through with this, are you? That's … that's insane!"
"115740052-0-23406";"This was once Scarp Keep. Now it is ruin."
"115740052-0-23407";"The gates were thought strong enough to keep out all invaders. They thought wrong."
"115740052-0-23408";"Orc Kings once sat here, in a place called Orsinium. Until it was stolen from them."
"115740052-0-23409";"You honor Trinimac and the Vosh Rakh with your actions. I knew we choose wisely when you arrived in Orsinium."
"115740052-0-23410";"The priests recorded and catalogued every Orc grudge within these halls."
"115740052-0-23411";"The Breton king's troops set all recorded grudges aflame. So now I burn them into the heart of every Orc."
"115740052-0-23412";"The great pyre. Untouched wood dragged from the far corners of Wrothgar. Set it aflame."
"115740052-0-23413";"You dare? Traitor! But you're too late to stop us. Our warriors are already inside the city."
"115740052-0-23414";"That was kind of exciting. I'll ward the door while you search the room. Find out what they're planning. Then go and let the others know."
"115740052-0-23415";"Sir … in addition to the king's letter, Lord Trystan wishes to convey his sincere condolences."
"115740052-0-23416";"""Sir?"" I am no knight. Call me ""savage"" as you would behind our backs."
"115740052-0-23417";"I will not, sir. ""Treat all with honor until proven otherwise,"" as my Lord Trystan teaches."
"115740052-0-23418";"Does your Lord Trystan think I'm above killing the messenger—especially a message such as this?"
"115740052-0-23419";"I do not presume, sir. I deliver the message as my lord requests—and his condolences."
"115740052-0-23420";"Well, presume yourself a bowl of stew before you run back to your lord. I'll not feed you to my cubs. Today."
"115740052-0-23421";"Yes. Yes, sir."
"115740052-0-23422";"Arakaul, we must speak."
"115740052-0-23423";"<<1>> has reinforced Orsinium. Our losses to his Savage Sons were … considerable."
"115740052-0-23424";"Your king should call off the siege. The battle is unjust."
"115740052-0-23425";"Shinji … Mercedene now commands us. The siege will not end."
"115740052-0-23426";"Mercedene? The Beast of the Reach is your general?"
"115740052-0-23427";"There's another way. Challenge Baloth to a duel. You could end the siege with a swing of your blade."
"115740052-0-23428";"The Orcs will never agree."
"115740052-0-23429";"The Orcs love Baloth more than their own king. He'll agree—his people have bled enough."
"115740052-0-23430";"Then it shall be. The Order of Diagna will march to Orsinium."
"115740052-0-23431";"King Joile suggested this. He needs a victory, and won't care who delivers it."
"115740052-0-23432";"Tu'whacca's breath! <<1>>, do you see this?"
"115740052-0-23433";"These monuments … millennia old. Redguard and Orc stonework. Side-by-side."
"115740052-0-23434";"Not just that. Order of Diagna and Savage Sons, intermingled."
"115740052-0-23435";"Orc stonework never presents enemies in equal standing."
"115740052-0-23436";"It seems an impossible thing."
"115740052-0-23437";"Yet we see it before us. There must be more answers within."
"115740052-0-23438";"""No duel should last longer than eight seconds."""
"115740052-0-23439";"What fool said that?"
"115740052-0-23441";"A duel for a city? Pathetic! King Joile wanted victory, and today I deliver it."
"115740052-0-23442";"<<1>>? What have you done?"
"115740052-0-23443";"Archers—now!"
"115740052-0-23444";"No!"
"115740052-0-23447";"Fool! If you bear them so much love, fall and die beside them!"
"115740052-0-23448";"Curse you, <<1>>. To the depths of Oblivion, I curse you!"
"115740052-0-23449";"It's a mess in here, I know … but it was the best I could do on short notice. Set the Kindlepitch before more of these cultists arrive!"
"115740052-0-23450";"Ice works wonders, Proselytizer. Ten converts this week alone!"
"115740052-0-23451";"But fire is better. I've guided fifteen to Trinimac's cause."
"115740052-0-23452";"Enough! Both of you bring honor to the Vosh Rakh."
"115740052-0-23453";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-23454";"My Mages are slaughtered. And still, Kargand must find his sister, Bakkhara. Will you help?"
"115740052-0-23455";"Your claws look sharp enough. This one would search to the last plane of Oblivion before giving up on his sister. If Bakkhara lives, we will find her."
"115740052-0-23456";"We failed. We never halted the Canonreeve's ritual. The final altar was here, in this realm, all along. We have to find it. Destroy it. I … what happened?"
"115740052-0-23457";"This one has been trapped for what feels like an eternity. Let's leave here at once."
"115740052-0-23458";"I don't believe it."
"115740052-0-23459";"One is clearly <<1>> … but the other …."
"115740052-0-23460";"<<1>>. Memorialized in stone."
"115740052-0-23461";"This is their tomb. Both of them?"
"115740052-0-23462";"They were mortal enemies. How can this be?"
"115740052-0-23463";"There must be a reason. We should look around, learn how this was possible."
"115740052-0-23464";"Myself! How long have we fought?"
"115740052-0-23465";"Eight minutes. What do you say on that?"
"115740052-0-23466";"I shall reconsider the proverb."
"115740052-0-23467";"You'll have to defeat me to pass it on."
"115740052-0-23468";"True enough! The best techniques are passed on by the survivors."
"115740052-0-23469";"That's a good proverb."
"115740052-0-23472";"You alone emerge from the Bloody Knoll. Did you pray to Malacath for your victory?"
"115740052-0-23473";"I needed no prayers. Only my strength."
"115740052-0-23474";"<<1>> was good for Shatul. Though <<2>> fell by my hand in the Bloody Knoll, I vow to lead by her father's example!"
"115740052-0-23475";"Then go forth, my chief, and receive your clan."
"115740052-0-23476";"This is the best Kurog has to send against us? Pitiful!"
"115740052-0-23477";"Keep your head down!"
"115740052-0-23478";"Your delightful slaughter has impressed The Rat!  Come, come! We have much to speak about!"
"115740052-0-23479";"You don't have to tell me twice!"
"115740052-0-23480";"Let it be known, the outsider who stands before us has betrayed our great city!"
"115740052-0-23481";"For your actions, I condemn you and your allies to death."
"115740052-0-23483";"A sentence you shall execute by your own hand."
"115740052-0-23484";"May Trinimac guide your blade."
"115740052-0-23486";"I'm sorry it had to come to this. But what I do I do for the good of the Orsimer people."
"115740052-0-23487";"I said, this is the tomb of <<1>>."
"115740052-0-23488";"<<1>>, what is this nonsense?"
"115740052-0-23489";"Come on! We're almost out of here!"
"115740052-0-23490";"<<1>> speaks for herself. This is the tomb of <<2>>, there is no question."
"115740052-0-23491";"Well, I have a question—has your partner lost her damned mind?"
"115740052-0-23492";"None of this will matter once we open the tomb."
"115740052-0-23493";"At which point <<1>> will be proven wrong."
"115740052-0-23494";"That I can trust my partner to back my findings? Yes, <<1>> is correct."
"115740052-0-23495";"Orsinium did not send me to mediate a family quarrel. Figure out whose tomb this is or I'll have the army drive you out."
"115740052-0-23496";"Yes, <<1>>. I often am."
"115740052-0-23497";"It worked. <<1>>, you were right!"
"115740052-0-23498";"On a good day, perhaps. Let's continue this inside."
"115740052-0-23499";"Anyone out there? Anyone that's not a Riekr, that is? I could use a hand!"
"115740052-0-23501";"Stay your hand, young Orc. Too much blood was spilled this day. Enough heroes lost."
"115740052-0-23502";"Agreed. The duel … did you see it? Was there a victor?"
"115740052-0-23503";"I saw a willow and a graht-oak, dancing in the wind. I thought their styles vastly different, until I realized …."
"115740052-0-23504";"""Adhere to the style that defeats your opponent."" People used to claim it was Shinji's proverb. Always made Baloth crack a smile."
"115740052-0-23505";"We've got Daedra assaulting the northern door. Get over there and take them down!"
"115740052-0-23506";"We've reinforced the door! Keep it up!"
"115740052-0-23507";"We've pushed them back! Great job! Head to the west door, that's where they'll hit next!"
"115740052-0-23508";"Another wave incoming! Get ready!"
"115740052-0-23509";"Eveli's one tough Wood Elf. She's clinging to life and won't let go."
"115740052-0-23510";"She asked to speak to you when you have a moment."
"115740052-0-23511";"This wasn't suppose to happen. I should have never sent her here by herself."
"115740052-0-23512";"Eveli saved me. I plan to return the favor."
"115740052-0-23513";"Kurog won't get away with this, little one. We'll stop him."
"115740052-0-23514";"Calm down. my brothers and sisters. We're in no condition to chase after anyone."
"115740052-0-23515";"I really dislike meddlesome interlopers."
"115740052-0-23516";"If the king's soldiers want to talk to Solgra, it must be for a good reason. We need to stay out of their way."
"115740052-0-23517";"Help! I'm on top of the tower!"
"115740052-0-23518";"Tell the king I'll play no part in his political games."
"115740052-0-23519";"I'll go check on Lord Ethian. He's a nervous sort."
"115740052-0-23520";"You betrayed King Kurog. I will kill you for that."
"115740052-0-23521";"My beloved says the moot is off limits. I'm sorry it's come to this, but you leave us no choice."
"115740052-0-23522";"I won't be much use in a fight, so I'll follow you. I suggest checking out more of the wrecks. Or maybe she headed for that tower over there."
"115740052-0-23524";"There's Holbert. And he's with that skeever, Lord Ethian. Let's see what they've got to say."
"115740052-0-23525";"Damn milksop is going to get himself killed. Go after him. I'm in no condition to keep anyone safe at the moment."
"115740052-0-23526";"They've broken through! Fall back! Hold the inner doors!"
"115740052-0-23527";"You'll regret letting me live. But I'll enjoy watching the king tear you apart!"
"115740052-0-23530";"Eveli, no! Find whoever did this! I'll get her back to the temple. Go!"
"115740052-0-23531";"High King Emeric will hear of this, you … you blackguard!"
"115740052-0-23532";"She … she stabbed me!"
"115740052-0-23533";"Well done! That's sure to draw some attention. Meet me back at your alliance base once the coast is clear."
"115740052-0-23534";"Malivus. He's already here! Damn."
"115740052-0-23535";"They haven't breached the doors yet. Akatosh is with us."
"115740052-0-23536";"I sent soldiers ahead to barricade the doors. They'll hold. I'm just not sure for how long."
"115740052-0-23537";"I feel … a bit … faint …."
"115740052-0-23539";"The Sublime Brazier should be this way. Follow me."
"115740052-0-23540";"The time has come, my friend. You must kneel before the Brazier."
"115740052-0-23541";"Lord Akatosh, Dragon-God of Time, a faithful supplicant kneels before you. She has served you for many lean years. Let her service now be everlasting!"
"115740052-0-23542";"Grant her your divine power. Bless her with the strength to defend this holy cathedral, and the will to endure a life of seclusion."
"115740052-0-23543";"Drape your exalted wings around her, and your works will be-"
"115740052-0-23544";"This ritual cannot be interrupted! You must hold the Cathedral until it is complete. Go!"
"115740052-0-23545";"Right. To show humility … obedience. I can do obedient. Just watch me."
"115740052-0-23546";"Don't rush the man, Captain. But yes, Egnatius, you really should hurry this up."
"115740052-0-23547";"I sent my soldiers outside to cause some havoc—keep the Daedra off-guard. I'd bet they're doing just that."
"115740052-0-23548";"Hurry it up, Father. Molag Bal is knocking."
"115740052-0-23549";"Follow me. Let's go send these Daedric beasts back to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-23550";"Assault the Cathedral! Destroy the Brazier! Leave none alive!"
"115740052-0-23551";"Shoot straight. Don't let them dig through!"
"115740052-0-23552";"May I speak with you a moment? I fear you've been misled."
"115740052-0-23553";"Now, confess what you have seen, worm!"
"115740052-0-23554";"Hmm. Apparently not."
"115740052-0-23555";"I never tire of slaying mortals, priest. But their blood is on your hands."
"115740052-0-23556";"How many more must die before you speak?"
"115740052-0-23560";"""The beast?"" By the Eight … Daedroth! Get down!"
"115740052-0-23561";"Fall back! We make our stand at the Brazier! Go!"
"115740052-0-23562";"More I hope. My blade is always thirsty."
"115740052-0-23564";"Useless fools! Send in the beast!"
"115740052-0-23565";"Slaughter the mortals! Destroy the Brazier!"
"115740052-0-23566";"Just a bit longer! You must hold!"
"115740052-0-23567";"My head … what's happening inside my head … ?"
"115740052-0-23568";"Useless churls! Must I handle everything myself?"
"115740052-0-23569";"Your souls are forfeit. Face the wrath of Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-23570";"Filthy wretch! Kneel, and I may favor you with a quick death!"
"115740052-0-23571";"This is all the wrath that Molag Bal can muster? I'm not impressed."
"115740052-0-23573";"It's time, Egnatius. Finish it now!"
"115740052-0-23574";"Lord Akatosh, we beseech you! Grant this mortal warrior your blessing, that she may keep watch over this holy place! Now, my child …."
"115740052-0-23575";"Lord Akatosh, I am yours! I pledge my blades and my soul to your service! I am your shield and your vengeance, now and for all time!"
"115740052-0-23576";"That's the last of them, yes? Good riddance."
"115740052-0-23577";"No? Shame. Perhaps one of your gentle friends knows something …."
"115740052-0-23580";"Meet me among the tradesmen. Quickly, if you please."
"115740052-0-23581";"Find anything interesting?"
"115740052-0-23586";"Oh, thank Mara! I thought my soul would be lost. Bless you, my child! Bless you!"
"115740052-0-23587";"I can … I can breathe again. Thank the Eight! May the love of Dibella go with you, stranger."
"115740052-0-23588";"Salvation! Thank the Eight. May Julianos give you wisdom, my friend. Farewell!"
"115740052-0-23590";"Fabulous! I could really use a break right now!"
"115740052-0-23591";"Are you joking? We just started!"
"115740052-0-23592";"Stibbons, don't you dare put down that firewood! It won't do us any good if it gets wet."
"115740052-0-23593";"You make a sound point, my lady."
"115740052-0-23594";"Those poor Orcs! Stibbons, be a dear and bury them."
"115740052-0-23595";"Don't be ridiculous! They died well. Leave them where they fell."
"115740052-0-23596";"Leave them? Out in the open? How barbaric!"
"115740052-0-23597";"Orcs don't bury their dead. And these are the first Orcs to rest on Sorrow in generations. We won't steal that honor from them."
"115740052-0-23598";"Fine. You are the expert, after all."
"115740052-0-23599";"Eight bless you, child! We shouldn't linger. Meet me in the southwest corner of the district. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-23600";"Akatosh bless you, child. I will forever be in your debt. Eight protect you."
"115740052-0-23603";"You leave me no choice. I'll unite the clans over your dead bodies!"
"115740052-0-23604";"But don't worry. Trinimac is waiting for you on the other side."
"115740052-0-23605";"Archers, eliminate the clan chiefs!"
"115740052-0-23606";"<<1>>, you idiot! Well, I'm not cleaning this up!"
"115740052-0-23607";"There are tombs, tables, altars, carvings and other things in this room. Must be one of those."
"115740052-0-23608";"Damn it!"
"115740052-0-23609";"As impressive as always, but it doesn't matter. My soldiers are already moving to block the tunnels."
"115740052-0-23610";"But even impressive criminals must pay for their crimes. I'm going to deal with you—personally!"
"115740052-0-23611";"Hey now, did you think I'd let you have all the fun?"
"115740052-0-23612";"Hmm. Nothing happened. Try moving them around a bit."
"115740052-0-23613";"Fools! Now you face the storm!"
"115740052-0-23614";"Get that totem first, then come free me. I'm not going anywhere."
"115740052-0-23615";"Ugh … my thanks. You need to get that book to the Drake. I managed to mask its contents with a magical cipher."
"115740052-0-23616";"Silence, chiefs! Your constant bickering has plagued our people for long enough!"
"115740052-0-23617";"Kurog's belittling the chiefs. They won't stand for that."
"115740052-0-23618";"You isolate yourselves in your own strongholds, perpetuating our selfish nature. We must change who and what we are!"
"115740052-0-23619";"Kurog's got a point. We're still going to kill the bastard, right."
"115740052-0-23620";"I tried to appeal to you as equals, but you refused to listen. I grow tired of arguing with you."
"115740052-0-23621";"The king cares for our people and all you do is break his heart."
"115740052-0-23622";"Wonderful. The murderous king and his lunatic mother. This will be interesting."
"115740052-0-23623";"I brought you here to finally settle the question of a united Orsimer nation. I brought you here to offer you a choice."
"115740052-0-23624";"We're getting close. Be ready for anything."
"115740052-0-23625";"Sounds like the time I walked in on an Imga courting ritual!"
"115740052-0-23626";"The choice is simple. Kneel before me as your king and ruler of the united Orsimer nation—or die!"
"115740052-0-23627";"We need to move faster. Kurog's about to start slaughtering the chiefs!"
"115740052-0-23628";"We've got legion traitors approaching from the west. Cut them down!"
"115740052-0-23629";"Once we get inside, find Kurog and take him down. We need to save as many chiefs as we can."
"115740052-0-23630";"Those who sided with Bal are traitors. Now they face judgment."
"115740052-0-23631";"Heads up! More of Bal's lackeys on the way!"
"115740052-0-23632";"I think we're clear on the west. More incoming on the south door. Get over there!"
"115740052-0-23633";"Another group inbound! This looks like the last of them! Keep fighting!"
"115740052-0-23634";"Stendarr! Lend me your power so I may deliver justice to these traitors!"
"115740052-0-23635";"The masters have joined the dogs. They, too, will be judged."
"115740052-0-23636";"There's a big group of Daedra headed for the south door. Hold them back!"
"115740052-0-23637";"Fear not. Arkay will protect us, so long as we smite his enemies, these foul Daedra."
"115740052-0-23638";"That's the last of them! Wait … there's something else. What is that?"
"115740052-0-23639";"I don't know what that thing is, but take it down! Now!"
"115740052-0-23640";"You did it! You broke their assault! We're in the clear."
"115740052-0-23641";"Fear not, brother Arrianus! I'm here! These Daedra stand no chance!"
"115740052-0-23642";"Of course you are, brother Justianas. Of course you are."
"115740052-0-23643";"There's still time if we move fast. We need to open this gate."
"115740052-0-23644";"There's no lever. They must have shut it from the other side."
"115740052-0-23645";"Stand aside and let me work! Get ready to get those people out of there!"
"115740052-0-23646";"I'll take care of the archers!"
"115740052-0-23647";"Now to make a show of helping with the search. Hopefully we'll soon be gone. As should you be!"
"115740052-0-23648";"Hello? Is someone there? A little help, please?"
"115740052-0-23649";"I'll go back and help Chief Bazrag. Don't get yourself killed without me!"
"115740052-0-23650";"You actually destroyed it."
"115740052-0-23651";"Forgive me for tracking you. I just … had to know."
"115740052-0-23654";"We saved many of the chiefs, but this doesn't feel like a victory."
"115740052-0-23655";"May your path to the Ashen Forge be lit with the braziers of courage, my one-time blade-brother."
"115740052-0-23656";"Ambassador Rigurt! I can't abide such behavior!"
"115740052-0-23657";"But … but … my jade goddess … I don't understand …."
"115740052-0-23658";"Oh, Rigurt, pay no attention to Lazdutha! You've won my heart with your gifts of affection!"
"115740052-0-23659";"Rulfala? This is most confusing. Rigurt had no idea you had such feelings."
"115740052-0-23660";"How could I not? After all, you completed the ancient marriage proposal. We're engaged now!"
"115740052-0-23661";"Rigurt never expected—wait. What?"
"115740052-0-23662";"Breathe. Just need to breathe. Fight it, man, fight it!"
"115740052-0-23663";"Hold your fire! That might be a survivor!"
"115740052-0-23664";"Find the ciphers. There should be four of them. Bring them to me in the Archives east of here, and I will use them to translate the book. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-23665";"There, it is done. Gods, how exhausting. Glad I never joined the Mages Guild—I just don't have the talent for this."
"115740052-0-23666";"Here, grandfather—a proper cairn to see you off and your death avenged by a true warrior. May your soul be forged into Malacath's blade."
"115740052-0-23667";"Another seeks to light my pyre. Weaker than those who fell? We shall see."
"115740052-0-23669";"Here comes a likely candidate now."
"115740052-0-23670";"Do you suppose this one has what it takes?"
"115740052-0-23671";"Contain your hopes. But let's find out."
"115740052-0-23672";"Well I'll be a harpy's uncle! I never expected to see you here."
"115740052-0-23673";"That was … unexpected. Never had a lid get stuck like that while I was … ah … investigating."
"115740052-0-23676";"Old friends, I'm glad to see you. This … is very important to me."
"115740052-0-23680";"I'm just sorry I missed all the action. It looks like you could have used another hand or two."
"115740052-0-23681";"Bumnog and hands. I think it's an obsession."
"115740052-0-23682";"I believe we're ready to begin."
"115740052-0-23683";"That's it! I can hear the locks turning. Come on!"
"115740052-0-23684";"Hope you weren't planning to start without me, chief."
"115740052-0-23685";"Eveli, it's good to see you here. Everyone, in fact. Thank you all for coming."
"115740052-0-23686";"Kurog's intentions were good, but his actions were not. Let's set aside the actions and reexamine his intentions."
"115740052-0-23687";"Even a good Orc can fall prey to ill-conceived notions. We need to bury the past with the king and look to the future."
"115740052-0-23688";"Outsider, step forward. Your help has been invaluable and I want you to be a part of this. Please, light the first torch."
"115740052-0-23689";"We ignite these fires to remember Kurog's true goal—unity for the Orsimer people."
"115740052-0-23690";"Instead, we have clans without chiefs, a city without a king. We will support these people, guide them."
"115740052-0-23691";"We must look to tomorrow. Outsider, light the second torch. It will burn away the past and guide us to the future."
"115740052-0-23692";"Remember the Kurog who was. Strong, confident. A king who cared about his people. We will carry on that legacy, offering help but never forcing it upon anyone."
"115740052-0-23693";"Much to my regret, the clan chiefs have asked me to take on the mantle of king of the Orsimer. To this request, I have cautiously agreed."
"115740052-0-23694";"We cannot be seen as weak and leaderless to the rest of the world. I shall uphold Kurog's dream but I will avoid his ambition. We shall stand together as the new Orsinium!"
"115740052-0-23695";"Say your farewells, then return to the keep. We must put this darkness behind us and celebrate a new day!"
"115740052-0-23696";"Coward!"
"115740052-0-23697";"I hope you're not giving that poor messenger a hard time, Bizra."
"115740052-0-23701";"I'm just … going to … go to sleep …."
"115740052-0-23702";"All dead, just as I feared. Wait, what's this?"
"115740052-0-23704";"Today tests our resolve. We have lost friends, allies. And the one responsible for all this, we've gathered to honor him."
"115740052-0-23705";"Some of you question the wisdom of that, but we need to see the Orsimer in a new light. We need to respect and honor each other. That starts today!"
"115740052-0-23706";"What is the meaning of this interruption, wretch? My watch is more important than your inane reports!"
"115740052-0-23707";"Apologies, exalted one. This report is urgent. I have reason to suspect that there may be a spy in the ranks of Legion Zero. One who plots the downfall of the Legion and its masters."
"115740052-0-23708";"A spy? I am charged with the protection of a great prize. I have no interest in petty mortal schemes, you half-witted cretin!"
"115740052-0-23709";"As you say, exalted one. I merely thought it would be to your benefit to learn of this first. If you prefer, I can take the news to one of my other masters though—it would pain me to see them take the glory in your stead."
"115740052-0-23710";"Glory you say? My lord Molag Bal does have a special distaste for traitors. Hold a moment, Captain—perhaps I can spare time for this so-called plot. Tell me about this spy. I will see you duly rewarded for your loyalty."
"115740052-0-23711";"I dare not say it out loud, my lord—ears are everywhere, you know. Anyone could be listening."
"115740052-0-23712";"Whisper it to me then. Who is this spy? They must be made to suffer."
"115740052-0-23713";"The spy's name … is Captain Regilus!"
"115740052-0-23715";"What is this … this …?"
"115740052-0-23716";"Masterpiece? Delivered as promised!"
"115740052-0-23717";"What is this mess?"
"115740052-0-23718";"Mess? But … this is an authentic replication of ogre artwork, as requested! The materials came straight from an ogre den!"
"115740052-0-23719";"By the Bloody Curse, <<1>>—it reeks!"
"115740052-0-23720";"Ah, you understand!"
"115740052-0-23721";"I understand the gorge rising in my throat."
"115740052-0-23722";"It's … perhaps not my best work."
"115740052-0-23723";"I did see a picture of a torch with a single candle below it when I came in here. I bet that's right!"
"115740052-0-23734";"They didn't skimp. Malivus brought his entire elite guard. I hope you brought more than planks and nails, Caudex."
"115740052-0-23735";"We must begin the ritual at once. Hurry, inside."
"115740052-0-23736";"Aaaaaaaaagh!"
"115740052-0-23737";"Eight protect us …."
"115740052-0-23738";"I can … I can see everything."
"115740052-0-23739";"More Daedra? No. You are not welcome here."
"115740052-0-23741";"Mortal arrogance draws us hence from the churning chaos of Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-23742";"Woe be upon those who dare summon us from our Father's cruel embrace!"
"115740052-0-23743";"Death is no release for you! Your souls shall return to Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-23744";"You'll regret coming here, mortal. You think you'll survive this? Amusing! You're bold … but foolish!"
"115740052-0-23746";"Impressive! Savor this victory, for it will be your last!"
"115740052-0-23747";"Your flesh is tired, mortal. Weak. Can you summon up the will to continue? I yearn to see you broken!"
"115740052-0-23748";"Another beast wounded? Ha! Despair, mortal! The master has arrived!"
"115740052-0-23749";"It seems the Ringmaster is slain, so entertainment must be temporarily suspended. \n\nSurvivors may go, but are encouraged to stay. Those who leave will be rounded up later."
"115740052-0-23750";"No! No! Let me go!"
"115740052-0-23751";"Damn furniture tore up my sword arm. I'm practically useless!"
"115740052-0-23752";"Whoever you are, can you move some of these damn crates? I'm stuck!"
"115740052-0-23753";"Hold your position! Let no Winterborn get past you!"

"115740052-0-23758";"Hey, go ahead and loot the wrecks. Don't mind me. I'm sure Lady Sovelle isn't in any immediate danger or anything."
"115740052-0-23759";"All right … on the count of three. I'll just run and not look back. Wait … who's … who's there?"

"115740052-0-23816";"Tell the villagers? Certainly! They'll want to hear all about how Narsis Dren saved the day!"
"115740052-0-23817";"Morkul clan! Our search is over. Today we are whole once more!"
"115740052-0-23818";"No longer shall we live in our ancestors' shadow. There is power in our blood, and at last we reclaim it."
"115740052-0-23819";"Behold, the Hand of Morkul!"

"115740052-0-23823";"I return from Morkuldin with our clan's greatest treasure. Behold, the Hand of Morkul!"
"115740052-0-23824";"It's true our ancestors locked away the hammer—but not for the reasons we thought."
"115740052-0-23825";"Morkuldin housed a blood-forge. It's true, our clan once turned to dark magic! But they faced this hard truth and abandoned it."
"115740052-0-23826";"For the blood we work into the metal is our own, not that of our enemies! I say to you, that is the strength of Morkul!"
"115740052-0-23827";"Shadows … shadows in the fog …."
"115740052-0-23828";"I heard a rumbling when you rekindled the forge. Maybe another way out? Anything to avoid those ogres!"
"115740052-0-23829";"I hope I'm making the right decision."
"115740052-0-23830";"Look! A door, hidden by the ice. Is that … sunlight?"
"115740052-0-23831";"What would your king say? He appointed Mercedene."

"115740052-0-23834";"Sounds like some of my soldiers are nearby. Come on!"
"115740052-0-23835";"This is close to Orsinium! Useful if we ever need to return to the blood … the heart-forge."
"115740052-0-23836";"Meet me at Morkul Stronghold?"
"115740052-0-23837";"Don't blame the Elf. She was just following orders. Tell you the truth, I need more soldiers like her in my army."
"115740052-0-23838";"What vile sorcery! We'll all be better off when this tree finally burns."
"115740052-0-23839";"You did it! This way!"
"115740052-0-23840";"This hammer shows our ancestors' strength. With it, we forge a new destiny!"
"115740052-0-23841";"Is that your ally, Ashaka?"
"115740052-0-23842";"Quiet! Ashaka speaks on a matter concerning the clan."
"115740052-0-23843";"Come here! Stand by my side as I address the clan."
"115740052-0-23844";"Prepare yourselves, my clan! Soon we march to Orsinium. We shall build it anew!"

"115740052-0-23847";"You think I'd run from you, Breton dog? I've simply chosen where you die!"
"115740052-0-23848";"This is … unexpected."
"115740052-0-23851";"Don't touch anything! I beg of you, talk to us first!"
"115740052-0-23852";"Good riddance to that piece of rubbish. How does someone claim to worship a god and go on about killing someone who doesn't agree?"
"115740052-0-23853";"I'm not sorry the Proselytizer is dead. She was a bad piece of work. Torturing and killing people who didn't see things her way."
"115740052-0-23854";"Poor bastards never had a chance."
"115740052-0-23855";"Leave no stone unturned. Anything you uncover could prove useful."
"115740052-0-23856";"Where did you take our supplies?"
"115740052-0-23857";"I'll kill a Winterborn every second until you tell me what I want to know!"
"115740052-0-23858";"This is the last of the supplies. Let's get these crates out of here."
"115740052-0-23859";"Don't even think it! These supplies belong to the Winterborn now!"
"115740052-0-23860";"The clan peasants? Are they on their way to Orsinium?"
"115740052-0-23861";"The soldiers escorted them and the wounded outsiders. They should be safe enough."
"115740052-0-23862";"Safe enough isn't good enough. Go after them. I'll continue to look for the Winterborn and the missing supplies."
"115740052-0-23863";"He paid you back? And with interest? About time! Maybe he finally sold some of those trinkets he loves so much."
"115740052-0-23864";"I ain't complaining and I ain't asking questions. I'm just glad I finally got paid."
"115740052-0-23865";"You have proven yourself capable of doing whatever Malacath asks of you. Good. Only the worthy may carry the sacred words."
"115740052-0-23866";"We did it! Come on!"
"115740052-0-23867";"And so an initiate has come. As before and as it will be again. Then it is my time."
"115740052-0-23868";"Strike true. Your quest will come to nothing if you falter here. Malacath demands sacrifice, even of his most devout children."
"115740052-0-23869";"Stay together, we're almost there."
"115740052-0-23870";"We're down here!"
"115740052-0-23871";"Gulug's scent! It's almost enough to make this one want to stop dealing with him."
"115740052-0-23872";"Arusha would agree, except for all the gold he gave us. He's got the luck of Jone and Jode, even if he smells like a dead horker!"
"115740052-0-23873";"This one hopes we are blessed with half his luck and twice his gold—but not his scent!"
"115740052-0-23874";"This bath is ours for as long as we want! I paid in advance!"
"115740052-0-23875";"You didn't have two gold pieces to rub together last time I saw you, Gulug. What changed?"
"115740052-0-23876";"Fortune happened, my lovely! And it fell right into my lap! Now come here and do the same and we'll both feel better!"
"115740052-0-23877";"And who might you be? Go find another bath house! I hired this one for the entire day!"
"115740052-0-23878";"I'll let you deal with this, Gulug darling. I'm going to go and get something to drink."
"115740052-0-23879";"Now for the trophy. Oh, that's disgusting."
"115740052-0-23880";"<<1>>, look! I cut this off <<2>>. My friend here struck the killing blow."
"115740052-0-23881";"Impressive, <<1>>. Why don't you show the others?"

"115740052-0-23883";"<<1>>? <<1>>! Huh … guess she's out."
"115740052-0-23884";"You found the elixir? Pour it on the tree! The Winterborn are on their way!"
"115740052-0-23885";"Defend the tree until the elixir does its work. Just don't let the Winterborn get close enough to heal it."
"115740052-0-23887";"Why … why do you disrupt my work? We must free ourselves of this prison of mortal flesh!"
"115740052-0-23888";"You don't know what you've done. My research … my body … my …."
"115740052-0-23889";"Well done, my friend! Well done indeed! Now let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-23890";"No! Stop the intruders! The tree must not be destroyed!"
"115740052-0-23891";"Yes … free at … last."
"115740052-0-23892";"No! Kill … me! Just … kill me! Kill me!"
"115740052-0-23893";"You are <<1>>, master of Orc cuisine?"
"115740052-0-23894";"""Master?"" I … yes, that's me. And you are?"
"115740052-0-23895";"Praised are Igrun, who ruled with steel blade and iron will. Ruthless, fearless leaders strengthen all who follow."
"115740052-0-23896";"Hey, I was walking here!"
"115740052-0-23897";"Run into me again and I'll knock your teeth out."
"115740052-0-23898";"Praised are Shatul, the peerless hunters. They strengthened the Orcs who worked steel and stone for the glory of Orsinium."
"115740052-0-23899";"Watch where you're going, you idiot!"
"115740052-0-23900";"I have a good mind to throw a lightning bolt at you!"
"115740052-0-23901";"<<1>>, hearth-wife to the king."
"115740052-0-23902";"Oh! Welcome to my kitchen. Can I get you something? Perhaps some candied chub loon? Fresh from the oven!"
"115740052-0-23903";"No, I have business in Orsinium … yet I expect you to join me there shortly. I want you to cook the feast that will honor my husband. Can you do this for the king of the Orcs?"
"115740052-0-23904";"Of course. It shall be a feast to remember!"
"115740052-0-23905";"Praised are Morkul, unrivaled in their craft. Their steel was as legendary as their tempers, the second pillar of strength in Orsinium."
"115740052-0-23906";"Praised are Tumnosh, the great builders. They did not fear the weight of mountains as they carved and shaped Orsinium."
"115740052-0-23907";"If there are not tools to build strong walls, then there is no need for weapons to defend. And if you cannot feed your people, there will be nothing to rule. A strong ruler is nothing if he stands alone."
"115740052-0-23908";"Wait! I'm here! Hold on!"
"115740052-0-23909";"<<1>>. You're late."
"115740052-0-23910";"But … chased by a giant … think she wanted to mate …."
"115740052-0-23911";"Well, now your job won't interfere with your personal life. You're fired."
"115740052-0-23912";"I can do this … I can do this!"
"115740052-0-23913";"Thank Trinimac you're here! Someone has to save my fellow priests inside the temple."
"115740052-0-23914";"May the luck of Trinimac be with you. I'll inform the guards and try to send more help your way."
"115740052-0-23915";"<<1>> earned some sleep. Let's get back to Shatul."
"115740052-0-23916";"Lazy beast. Wake up!"
"115740052-0-23917";"Thank you for helping us. I … I thought they were going to kill us."
"115740052-0-23918";"Please, there's no need for this insanity. Just leave us alone!"
"115740052-0-23919";"Leave this one alive. Someone has to give Kurog the message."
"115740052-0-23920";"You … you killed them. Why would you do this?"
"115740052-0-23921";"You … you were too late. Maybe the others … maybe Solgra reached them and they're all right."
"115740052-0-23922";"Cursed are Bagrakh for lighting the fire that engulfed Orsinium. Warriors should raid the weak to draw out worthy opposition—they should not grow to enjoy it."
"115740052-0-23923";"Cursed are Igrun who praised the raiding done in their name. They hid behind these walls when called to account, rather than face their opponents directly."
"115740052-0-23924";"Cursed are Shatul who hoarded the food amidst the siege. Their greed weakened all clans in body and spirit, sealing Orsinium's doom."
"115740052-0-23925";"Cursed are Fharun for not fighting to the death. At the first suggestion from the others, they slipped away so one clan might survive Orsinium's fall. Their departure was Orsinium's true betrayal."
"115740052-0-23926";"Kurog's people have arrived. Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-23927";"For Malacath! For Bazrag!"
"115740052-0-23928";"Solgra and the others should be somewhere through this door."
"115740052-0-23929";"I'll find a way to open the main temple doors and let the soldiers in. Good luck."
"115740052-0-23930";"One? I plan to kill a dozen more if you don't leave my temple now!"
"115740052-0-23931";"My soul to the Ashen Forge …."
"115740052-0-23932";"This is the last of them! Let's finish these bastards off!"
"115740052-0-23933";"Come closer. We should speak."
"115740052-0-23934";"Solgra, my child, come join us. Are you injured? Should I call a healer?"
"115740052-0-23935";"Thanks to our friend, I am well and ready to serve."
"115740052-0-23936";"Yes, our call for assistance has already proven to be a more than worthwhile endeavor."
"115740052-0-23937";"I am well enough, but innocent blood was spilled in the temple this day."
"115740052-0-23938";"I grieve for your fellow priests as much as you do, but changing the Orsimer way of life brings risks we are all well aware of."
"115740052-0-23939";"Trinimac's words … I came here to share them, not to bury my brothers and sisters in the faith."
"115740052-0-23940";"Excuse me! Remember me? From the Winterborn ambush? The caravan? Hey, I'm talking to you!"
"115740052-0-23941";"Perhaps you'll be so kind as to put in a good word about me with the king. I'd so enjoy an invitation to his cornerclub!"
"115740052-0-23942";"Get that <<z:1>> to <<2>>. And thanks. I won't forget your help."
"115740052-0-23943";"Ah, there you are! Guess what. I have another message for you from the king."
"115740052-0-23944";"I'll meet up with you later! Go see Solgra but don't take too long!"
"115740052-0-23945";"Submit to the will of Molag Bal. Fall to your knees and worship me."
"115740052-0-23946";"That which is eternal can never die."

"115740052-0-23974";"It's certainly well hidden. If Bazrag lied to us, then we're probably about to meet with horrible, horrible deaths."
"115740052-0-23975";"Thank you so much"
"115740052-0-23977";"This illusion is so weird. It looks like I'm wearing robes, but I feel so … unencumbered."
"115740052-0-23978";"This is like the time I licked one of our great hists. I feel so … exposed."
"115740052-0-23979";"It's merely an illusion bound to the amulet. Nothing to be concerned about. I've seen these used at festivals and grand balls back home."
"115740052-0-23980";"I wonder if they come in different colors?"
"115740052-0-23981";"Stay safe! Flies and I will meet up with you later."
"115740052-0-23982";"I guess we're really doing this, aren't we?"
"115740052-0-23983";"That doesn't sound good. I thought we were just spying on a meeting."
"115740052-0-23984";"You, the chosen of the Vosh Rakh, have shown bravery against the Malacath heretics, even going so far as to invade the temple we love and cherish."
"115740052-0-23985";"But one challenge remains. A challenge to test you, to select the most worthy for our most important mission."
"115740052-0-23986";"Now choose a scroll and select a blessing to help you in your ordeal. Elder Azulg will answer any questions you have. Now, in Trinimac's name, may you find great honor—or an honorable death!"
"115740052-0-23987";"Tell Narsis I quit! So long Borfree!"
"115740052-0-23988";"Oh, this is going to be a day at the fair."
"115740052-0-23989";"It was tough, but we made it! I knew we could do it!"
"115740052-0-23990";"Make your choice."
"115740052-0-23991";"Thank you traveler. You've done the job I hired this apparent reject to do."
"115740052-0-23993";"That rumbling! Do you feel it?"
"115740052-0-23994";"The wall shifted! Sealed away, but hidden in plain sight. Morkuldin … lost among the ice."
"115740052-0-23995";"You can't lock us out of our inn! That's … tyrannical!"
"115740052-0-23996";"You should have thought about that before you helped the enemies of our king. Now get out of my way before I toss you in a cell, too."
"115740052-0-24001";"Ah, there you are! I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up."
"115740052-0-24003";"More people arrive in Orsinium every day. But our supplies keep getting stolen."
"115740052-0-24004";"The Winterborn are responsible. Someone needs to deal with them."
"115740052-0-24005";"Any time you want to go out and take care of that, I'll wave to you from the walls."
"115740052-0-24006";"Hold on there, friend. Only soldiers and guards past this point."
"115740052-0-24007";"No thanks. I'm saving my energy for when real danger shows up."
"115740052-0-24008";"Some of those new arrivals are already helping out the city."
"115740052-0-24009";"The Winterborn have had their noses bloodied, all right."
"115740052-0-24010";"And our supplies have finally started arriving on time. Someone's earned a drink at the inn."
"115740052-0-24011";"You find out who's responsible and that drink's on me."
"115740052-0-24012";"How can you fish at a time like this?"
"115740052-0-24013";"What are you talking about? This is the perfect time of day to fish."
"115740052-0-24014";"Haven't you heard? Malacath fanatics have taken control of the temple!"
"115740052-0-24015";"That's what happens when people don't take the time to fish."
"115740052-0-24016";"That's your solution to all the world's problems? Fishing? Arrgh!"
"115740052-0-24017";"You seem happy."
"115740052-0-24018";"I'm fishing. Of course I'm happy."
"115740052-0-24019";"Haven't you heard? Someone rescued the priests at the temple. Saved them from Malacath fanatics."
"115740052-0-24020";"Religion breeds fanatics. It's inevitable."
"115740052-0-24021";"You and your fishing! It makes me so angry!"
"115740052-0-24022";"Hey! You're not allowed up here! Don't let them pass!"
"115740052-0-24023";"We have the traitors. Now we need to eliminate the remaining loose ends at the inn."
"115740052-0-24024";"What's taking them so damn long? We've got a schedule to keep!"
"115740052-0-24025";"What's wrong, priestess?"
"115740052-0-24026";"The king assaults Frostbreak Fortress. I pray he has the strength to finally defeat the Ice-Heart."
"115740052-0-24027";"Surely someone will help the king? Trinimac will see to that!"
"115740052-0-24029";"Trinimac provides the challenge, but it's up to us to meet it."
"115740052-0-24030";"I will read from the Book of Trinimac. Orsinium hear his words!"
"115740052-0-24031";"Well, I think Trinimac will send the king a champion to help defeat Urfon Ice-Heart once and for all."
"115740052-0-24032";"Trinimac hates whiners and complainers. Remember that."
"115740052-0-24033";"Can we end our vigil and return to the temple now?"
"115740052-0-24034";"It was our vigil that brought down the Winterborn warlord. Keep tending the sacred flame."
"115740052-0-24035";"But with the supplies recovered, I heard the high priestess was going to throw a party."
"115740052-0-24036";"I don't care if the king invites you to his moot! Tend to the sacred flame!"
"115740052-0-24037";"By Trinimac's sharp sword, you're a pain in my tusks …"
"115740052-0-24038";"I hear the footsteps of an outsider. Come. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-24039";"Awake? Good. It's about time. I would have been disappointed if you died after I dragged you down here."
"115740052-0-24040";"I heard that cultists have overrun Fharun Stronghold."
"115740052-0-24041";"Damn Vosh Rakh! Their Trinimac nonsense is going to be the downfall of this city."
"115740052-0-24042";"After what happened at the temple, I'm inclined to agree with you."
"115740052-0-24043";"You two are worried about nothing. The king will deal with those traitors soon enough."
"115740052-0-24044";"That was Malacath fanatics. Haven't you heard? Chief Bazrag sent them to kill the high priestess."
"115740052-0-24045";"Why would the chief want to harm Trinimac's mouthpiece? That makes no sense."
"115740052-0-24046";"Who knows why chiefs do any of the things they do? Politics, I suppose."
"115740052-0-24047";"Right, right … blame it on politics. That's always your excuse."
"115740052-0-24048";"If we don't get back to work, we'll have to go into politics to make a living."
"115740052-0-24049";"<<1>>, hurry up! We need to make the stables presentable!"
"115740052-0-24050";"What is the rush? With all the talk about traitors and cultists, who's going to care about an untidy stable?"
"115740052-0-24052";"And now, it's time for my Barons to return to me!"
"115740052-0-24053";"Stand back, I haven't done this in quite some time. I'd hate to turn you inside-out."
"115740052-0-24054";"Baron Who Moves Like a Smoking Plume, I summon you! Return to me!"
"115740052-0-24055";"I wish you had listened to me, but I expected you'd come here."
"115740052-0-24056";"That's exactly why it has to look spotless! The king's soldiers are going to tear the city apart to find Bazrag the Betrayer."
"115740052-0-24057";"Maybe the traitors will hide in here with the echateres. Ha!"
"115740052-0-24058";"You make jokes but I did hear that the king's mood has gotten very dark indeed."
"115740052-0-24059";"Bah, who cares if the king is in a bad mood? What's he going to do? Execute us?"
"115740052-0-24060";"I heard he killed a clan chief just for disagreeing with him."
"115740052-0-24061";"That's just a tale told by the shield-wives to scare the outsiders."
"115740052-0-24062";"Do you really want to take a chance? I say we work together and we can get this place sparkling in no time!"
"115740052-0-24064";"It's about time you woke up. Took you long enough."
"115740052-0-24065";"Well? Can we get out of this damnable weather yet?"
"115740052-0-24066";"I'm afraid not. Skalar says guests for the king's moot take precedence."
"115740052-0-24067";"Lorkhan take the king's moot! We had an agreement!"
"115740052-0-24068";"Please, keep your voice down! Don't call attention to us!"
"115740052-0-24069";"All right, all right. But if we have to spend another night out in the freezing cold …."
"115740052-0-24070";"I understand. I'm sure we'll find an available room soon."
"115740052-0-24071";"Isn't the moot over? Can't we have a room now?"
"115740052-0-24072";"I'm not sure you're aware of everything that's happened …."
"115740052-0-24073";"I heard there was a ruckus at the moot. That shouldn't interfere with me getting out of the cold!"
"115740052-0-24074";"People died at the moot!"
"115740052-0-24075";"Then I doubt they will need their beds!"
"115740052-0-24076";"Chiefs have died and all you can think about is a room? Oh, very well."
"115740052-0-24077";"Approach me, my baron! Let me get a good look at you!"
"115740052-0-24078";"You look splendid, simply splendid."
"115740052-0-24079";"It is good to be with you again, my prince."
"115740052-0-24080";"And you! Your assistance has been most satisfactory. I won't forget it. \n\nOr, anyway, my tutor won't forget it."
"115740052-0-24081";"<<1>>! I shall extract the blood price for <<2>>'s murder!"
"115740052-0-24082";"Truly? Then prepare yourself."
"115740052-0-24083";"Lots of activity in the city. Everyone seems pretty excited."
"115740052-0-24084";"Anyone look like they're worried about something? Maybe the Winterborn have returned?"
"115740052-0-24085";"Not so much. I think something happened at the moot."
"115740052-0-24086";"Let's see if someone can tell us what happened. I hate not knowing what's going on."
"115740052-0-24087";"Yeah, maybe one of the soldiers or a priest. I wonder if it has anything to do with the Vosh Rakh cultists."
"115740052-0-24088";"I think it has something to do with the chiefs. There were a lot of them in the city for the moot."
"115740052-0-24089";"I heard something about the shield-wives. They're always causing trouble."
"115740052-0-24090";"Whatever's going on, at least the city is coming along nicely. It's very impressive!"
"115740052-0-24091";"Have you heard what happened? King Kurog is dead!"
"115740052-0-24092";"Really? How in Malacath's name does a king get murdered in his own city?"
"115740052-0-24093";"Lucky, I guess. But we have a new king."
"115740052-0-24094";"A new king? That's mighty brave of someone. And who is our new king?"
"115740052-0-24095";"Chief Bazrag. Or should I say King Bazrag? He's wearing the crown now."
"115740052-0-24096";"I bet that crown hurts. It looks pretty solid and heavy."
"115740052-0-24097";"I think he'll make a good king. Better than what Kurog turned to in the end."
"115740052-0-24098";"Let's go see what this new king looks like. I bet he's a giant!"
"115740052-0-24099";"Damn it! The interfering Wood Elf got in the way! Fall back!"
"115740052-0-24100";"Did <<1>> say ""brain pocket?"" Is that what she's cooking?"
"115740052-0-24101";"Don't worry, it isn't Elf brains. They're far sweeter. I, um. I heard."
"115740052-0-24102";"Ventricle pie doesn't sound bad. It should sound bad … like something <<1>> would eat."
"115740052-0-24103";"I was raised in Windhelm! You know what, go try some. I'm sticking to rations."
"115740052-0-24104";"I can't do this! I can't do this!"
"115740052-0-24105";"Quick! Let's get—argh!"
"115740052-0-24106";"She's down! Make sure none of her allies survive!"
"115740052-0-24107";"Kick him in his tusks … for me …."
"115740052-0-24108";"Hunted one! Now you die!"
"115740052-0-24109";"Rest now, Eveli. You need your sleep."
"115740052-0-24110";"I need to speak to you for a moment. This way."
"115740052-0-24111";"Gara go yara ar!"
"115740052-0-24113";"You are only one—but I am many! Now die!"
"115740052-0-24114";"I will slay you myself!"
"115740052-0-24115";"They were soldiers! Trying to stop them would have only put us all in danger!"
"115740052-0-24116";"You could have done something! You're cowards! All of you!"
"115740052-0-24117";"Eveli, enough! Solgra's gone. More priests getting killed wouldn't have changed that."
"115740052-0-24118";"I should have been here … to save her."
"115740052-0-24120";"May Trinimac take you to your final reward, high priestess."
"115740052-0-24121";"Chief Bazrag! I thought you were a firm believer in Malacath?"
"115740052-0-24122";"There's no place for a gentle soul in the Ashen Forge, priest. So why not let Trinimac have her?"
"115740052-0-24123";"Goodbye, my friend. I'm going to miss you."
"115740052-0-24124";"High priestess, no!"
"115740052-0-24125";"Get the assassin! I'll take Solgra back to the temple! Go!"
"115740052-0-24126";"I'll check over here."
"115740052-0-24127";"Look at this mess! We'll never find anything in here! Look around and see if you can find something that looks like a hidden passage."
"115740052-0-24128";"Well, I'll be a puny Dark Elf! You found it! I guess we're climbing down that hole."
"115740052-0-24129";"I knew you could do it! Now let's go stop the king."
"115740052-0-24130";"That gate doesn't appear to be locked. Go on. I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-24131";"No! You cannot take this from me. Malacath, guide my blade!"
"115740052-0-24132";"There she is! Don't let the traitor get away!"
"115740052-0-24133";"I'm warning you. Back off or you'll feel the sting of my arrows!"
"115740052-0-24134";"There she is! My arrow will find its mark!"
"115740052-0-24135";"More soldiers! Stay back, high priestess!"
"115740052-0-24136";"Stop them! Don't let the traitors get past you!"
"115740052-0-24137";"Behind you! On the ledges! More soldiers!"
"115740052-0-24138";"We've been betrayed! Defend yourselves!"
"115740052-0-24139";"And now the last guest has arrived. I'm going to make you pay for your disloyalty."
"115740052-0-24140";"Clan chiefs, over here! Arrgh! Hurry, this gate is … heavier than it looks."
"115740052-0-24141";"Eveli, I need you! Keep those Vosh Rakh bastards off of me!"
"115740052-0-24142";"Why have you called us here? What burden has been laid upon you?"
"115740052-0-24143";"I'm glad you've come to the city. Recently, a bat made off with my baby!"
"115740052-0-24144";"Wonderful. He's been hitting the skooma again!"
"115740052-0-24145";"The other day I stopped by the bath-house. Did you know they serve wine from Summerset? It made the pedicure bearable!"
"115740052-0-24146";"What's the name of the Argonian that works there? Great gills, lazy eye, breath smells like moon-sugar?"
"115740052-0-24147";"I heard it was ""Does-All-Things."""
"115740052-0-24148";"Heard any good stories lately?"
"115740052-0-24149";"I heard the Winterborn have their backs to the wall. The king is pushing them out of this fine land."
"115740052-0-24150";"I could tell you a story about an Elf I found … twisted in half. But I don't want to make you weep."
"115740052-0-24151";"Still won't wake up. Give a kick, see if that helps."
"115740052-0-24152";"<<1>>! You … were chosen by Malacath to lead Shatul."
"115740052-0-24153";"For despite the many reasons why you should not be chief, your defiance of Malacath's proves your strength. And now, I ask you …."
"115740052-0-24154";"Know this, my clan! A new era begins today—the era of the Orc! At King Kurog's side, we shall lead Tamriel to greatness!"
"115740052-0-24155";"I'm glad you're here. How long has it been?"
"115740052-0-24156";"Too long, that's for sure. But we can't all be shield-wife to a king!"
"115740052-0-24157";"Does priest appreciate Rigurt's gift? It's filled with the finest Nord spices and … well, you probably don't want to know about the ""and."""
"115740052-0-24158";"Are you sure this is safe to eat? I'm not sure I even know what this is."
"115740052-0-24159";"Will you return to Black Marsh, my friend? Or do you have another destination in mind?"
"115740052-0-24160";"As long as it's not here, I'll go wherever the current takes me."
"115740052-0-24161";"I'd be honored, um, King Bazrag, your majesty."
"115740052-0-24162";"What a welcome surprise! Thank you, King Bazrag."
"115740052-0-24163";"Thanks for the offer, but I … I can't. Not after everything that's happened."
"115740052-0-24164";"I understand. Thank you for everything you've done, little Elf. I shall miss you."
"115740052-0-24165";"Vestige. Attend me. I must speak with you."
"115740052-0-24166";"But … but …. I understand."
"115740052-0-24167";"Just a moment, Arakaul."
"115740052-0-24168";"One moment, Tamahl."
"115740052-0-24169";"<<1>>? I was wondering …."
"115740052-0-24170";"Yes? About what?"
"115740052-0-24171";"Now that we found <<1>> …."
"115740052-0-24172";"And <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24173";"Of course, of course … such a finding would take months to explore."
"115740052-0-24174";"It could take years."
"115740052-0-24175";"Years? Do you think? I … yes, it could take years."
"115740052-0-24176";"What are you saying, <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24177";"Could we, perhaps … that is, if you're interested … maybe …."
"115740052-0-24178";"Study this tomb together?"
"115740052-0-24179";"Yes! That is, if you're interested. Are you interested? You're not interested."
"115740052-0-24180";"On one condition."
"115740052-0-24181";"Yes? Name it!"
"115740052-0-24182";"Top listing in every journal."
"115740052-0-24183";"But … I thought we'd agreed on alphabetical!"
"115740052-0-24184";"Ha! <<1>>, you still can't tell when I'm pulling your tusk?"
"115740052-0-24185";"Oh. Heh. So … we continue as we were?"
"115740052-0-24186";"Of course. You can't get rid of me that easily."
"115740052-0-24187";"Good, that's … ahem. Good."
"115740052-0-24188";"We need to find a way into that fort to get to Ice-Heart. Talk to the siege commanders and see if they can get us inside."
"115740052-0-24189";"All better, my little tundra flower?"
"115740052-0-24190";"Better. But if I hear you say anything about ""stoking the forge,"" you're back in the echatere pen."
"115740052-0-24191";"You. Get over here."
"115740052-0-24192";"Follow me, and keep quiet!"
"115740052-0-24193";"Welcome to the shadows, friend. We have much work to do."
"115740052-0-24195";"<screams as a harpy grabs them and picks them up into the air>"
"115740052-0-24196";"Your people must have talked to this ""<<1>>."" We were at sea!"
"115740052-0-24197";"Why reveal our skooma supplier to some merchant lord who wants a cut?"
"115740052-0-24198";"You weren't supposed to tell anyone about our arrangement."
"115740052-0-24199";"I need your … ""volunteers"" … for my experiments. I would never ruin things for my supplier."
"115740052-0-24200";"I won't listen to the lies of a Daedra worshiper! I'll summon the Grand Chanter. He'll deal with you!"
"115740052-0-24202";"How dare you utter such blasphemy in this holy city! The Grand Chanter shall hear of this!"
"115740052-0-24203";"How can you say such things? You monster!"
"115740052-0-24204";"You dare shout that Daedric filth's name? Heretic!"
"115740052-0-24205";"Wait! Keep low, and keep quiet!"
"115740052-0-24206";"That's enough blasphemy out of you for one day! The Grand Chanter wants to have a word with you."
"115740052-0-24208";"Traps … everywhere! Can't fall … asleep …."
"115740052-0-24209";"The Iron Wheel, here? Are they protecting <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24210";"What's this? A message to <<1>>? Let's see what it says …."
"115740052-0-24211";"I still feel bad about what happened in the Imperial City."
"115740052-0-24212";"Oh, don't worry about it, I'm sure it'll be fine."
"115740052-0-24213";"That poor thing! I yanked its tail right off!"
"115740052-0-24214";"Damn it. Damn it! Change of plans, you need to see this."
"115740052-0-24221";"Lieutenant, how has this heretic transgressed against the Dragon God?"
"115740052-0-24222";"By spreading the word of Boethiah to the initiates."
"115740052-0-24225";"There's only one punishment for blasphemy. Behead them!"
"115740052-0-24226";"What? Isn't that a little extreme?"
"115740052-0-24227";"You dare question the will of Akatosh?"
"115740052-0-24230";"It doesn't say anything about beheadings in the Book of Akatosh."
"115740052-0-24231";"Silence, initiate! Lieutenant, deliver Akatosh's justice."
"115740052-0-24232";"Is this the life you hoped for, Josseline?"
"115740052-0-24234";"Remember, check the shrines along Varen's Wall. And do try to keep the mayhem and slaughter to a minimum!"
"115740052-0-24235";"I knew I would find you here, blasphemer! Die!"
"115740052-0-24236";"Josseline, Josseline. Could you be any more predictable?"
"115740052-0-24237";"My dear sister, I knew you'd find me. Are you here to kill me, too?"
"115740052-0-24238";"I didn't like the way we left things, Josseline. And when I realized what the Grand Chanter was up to …."
"115740052-0-24239";"So my big sister sails in to rescue me. Again. Tell me, how many did the Grand Chanter kill?"
"115740052-0-24240";"At least three people since I've been paying attention. I haven't been in town that long."
"115740052-0-24241";"So you called in someone to help?"
"115740052-0-24242";"So you called in Sheogorath over there?"
"115740052-0-24243";"I know you're angry, but he really would have killed you, Josseline. I couldn't let that happen."
"115740052-0-24244";"You don't have to worry about me anymore. I'm done with the Society and I'm done with Kvatch. But I am not going with you."
"115740052-0-24245";"Fair enough. But any time you need me, I'll be there."
"115740052-0-24246";"I know. Goodbye, sister."
"115740052-0-24247";"Filthy Orc! I should have gutted you the moment you entered our camp!"
"115740052-0-24248";"Did you fall and land directly upon your skull? I … am … retired!"
"115740052-0-24249";"Keeba is not for the likes of you! He's destined for the Commodore!"
"115740052-0-24250";"<<1>>! Do not make me beg. It is unbecoming of our most profitable history."
"115740052-0-24252";"And who is this, <<1>>? Who else befouls my garden?"
"115740052-0-24254";"This way … hurry!"
"115740052-0-24258";"I'm tired of your complaining. Pay what you owe or the Red Sails will seize this ship."
"115740052-0-24259";"Fine! Take your ransom and choke on it."
"115740052-0-24260";"There now! Was that so difficult?"
"115740052-0-24261";"Difficult is keeping my claws from ripping out your throat."
"115740052-0-24263";"Someone's coming!"
"115740052-0-24264";"Hide before they see you. I left a surprise in the warehouse, but it's not ready. Not yet."
"115740052-0-24265";"You see? No one here. Trying to cover up for your nap?"
"115740052-0-24266";"<<1>> is ever vigilant! There is an intruder in this warehouse!"
"115740052-0-24267";"<<1>>'s people are on their way to inspect the warehouse. We don't have time for this nonsense!"
"115740052-0-24268";"Well?"
"115740052-0-24269";"What choice do we have? We're in."
"115740052-0-24270";"You don't seem to mind living here. I thought you hated water."
"115740052-0-24271";"No, I hate traveling by ship. I take no issue with water."
"115740052-0-24274";"Good. Then I shall make your documents disappear."
"115740052-0-24275";"How are you settling in?"
"115740052-0-24276";"It's a bit more communal than my academy. Which sounds far less obnoxious when you're from the Summerset Isles."
"115740052-0-24277";"That went well, I think."
"115740052-0-24278";"Are you from Abah's Landing?"
"115740052-0-24279";"I am a creature of Abah's Landing. Without this city, I would not be the person you know."
"115740052-0-24280";"An explosion? <<1>> knew something was amiss!"
"115740052-0-24281";"What do you think of the Thieves Guild?"
"115740052-0-24282";"We live in a cistern."
"115740052-0-24283";"Surprise, you fools. I'll collect <<1>>—meet us back at <<Ac:2>>."
"115740052-0-24285";"Why does Abah's Landing … well, I don't know how to ask this without causing offense."
"115740052-0-24286";"I am rarely offended. Please, ask."
"115740052-0-24287";"Did you ever have a pet?"
"115740052-0-24288";"And what is your interest in the matter, exactly?"
"115740052-0-24290";"I can locate <<1>>'s dowry. I can return it to you within the fortnight."
"115740052-0-24291";"You know the routine, moneybags."
"115740052-0-24292";"Again? You know I have to actually sell stuff to pay your ""tax""?"
"115740052-0-24293";"You got one day. Drum up some business, or else."
"115740052-0-24295";"If you recover <<1>>'s dowry, I can guarantee our return to Taneth."
"115740052-0-24296";"The Iron Wheel must leave Hew's Bane. You're simply bad for business."
"115740052-0-24297";"I do not drink."
"115740052-0-24298";"Then I shall take your share. Come, an office is no place to do business."
"115740052-0-24306";"We know where <<1>> is? Are we going to rescue her?"
"115740052-0-24307";"What do you mean ""we?"" I'm retired."
"115740052-0-24308";"<<1>> would do the same for any of us. Even you, <<2>>."
"115740052-0-24309";"The least we can do is hear out our acting guildmaster. So what is the plan?"
"115740052-0-24311";"My good man! Is this the gate to Abah's Landing?"
"115740052-0-24312";"Halt! This citadel is under jurisdiction of the Iron Wheel!"
"115740052-0-24313";"Never heard of that tavern. What do they sell?"
"115740052-0-24314";"You should move along. What, uh … that bottle you have, what is that?"
"115740052-0-24315";"Delicious! Some wine from, uh … Berga … Bergomet? Bergama! Why, you want some?"
"115740052-0-24316";"If you're offering. Just a nip to get my blood pumping."
"115740052-0-24317";"Tava's tail feathers, it's awful! What … what is that … that taste …."
"115740052-0-24318";"Something to which I'm immune. But he's right, it does taste awful."
"115740052-0-24320";"How can we expect a decent forgery? I can barely read your writing."
"115740052-0-24321";"That is intentional. I write defensively! It keeps prying eyes from deciphering my ledger."
"115740052-0-24322";"My distractions worked, as expected. I'll stick to the shadows for now."
"115740052-0-24323";"A word, if you please. I have a suggestion."
"115740052-0-24324";"You don't know me yet, but I'm a friend. <<1>>, isn't it? Put on this uniform and head outside. The Iron Wheel won't detain a Windhelm Guard."
"115740052-0-24325";"There's no way I'm leaving here without my partner."
"115740052-0-24326";"I only had one uniform. Go on, recover your boat and meet us by the catacomb exit. Then we can return to the Thieves Guild in Abah's Landing."
"115740052-0-24327";"You're from the Thieves Guild? I … all right, I'll meet you both by the exit. Good luck, partner."
"115740052-0-24328";"She'll be fine. Looks like we take the dangerous way around."
"115740052-0-24329";"No, I spent much of my life in the academy. They wouldn't allow it. Why do you ask?"
"115740052-0-24330";"Follow me, we're almost there!"
"115740052-0-24331";"I hope the recent unpleasantness won't affect our most enduring friendship."
"115740052-0-24332";"Friends are like mealworms. Best to slip them a mild poison if they gorge themselves on your goodwill."
"115740052-0-24333";"So. What have you been doing since your retirement?"
"115740052-0-24334";"Avoiding smalltalk."
"115740052-0-24335";"We're settled, then? No favors I owe you?"
"115740052-0-24336";"Of course, <<1>>! I know how much you hate to be in anyone's debt."
"115740052-0-24337";"<<1>>. Did you ever meet a High Elf named Saroldo?"
"115740052-0-24338";"No. Why, does he owe you money? I could assist you in any remunerative encounters!"
"115740052-0-24339";"You've changed. Something is different about you."
"115740052-0-24340";"I'm retired. I don't need to care for anything but my garden."
"115740052-0-24341";"It has been invigorating to provide assistance to the Thieves Guild! I do hope our arrangement continues."
"115740052-0-24342";"What arrangement?"
"115740052-0-24343";"You're too prissy for a thief."
"115740052-0-24344";"Good day to you too, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24345";"<<1>>, have you worked with the Thieves Guild? Before the troubles, I mean."
"115740052-0-24346";"The great merchant lord <<1>> once called <<2>> his home. We were little more than his puppets."
"115740052-0-24347";"Eh … none of that is true. I sold <<1>> things for her garden."
"115740052-0-24348";"The merchant lords grow complacent. Why? No Thieves Guild to keep them in line!"
"115740052-0-24349";"But … you are the Thieves Guild. Is there … is there another?"
"115740052-0-24350";"No, she means we're a pale shadow of our former selves."
"115740052-0-24351";"I don't think they saw me."
"115740052-0-24352";"Are you all right? You're greener than my favorite vest."
"115740052-0-24353";"<<1>> would never have let <<2>> slip past his notice."
"115740052-0-24354";"<<1>> had eyes and ears throughout Abah's Landing."
"115740052-0-24355";"Hold them off! I'll find another way out!"
"115740052-0-24356";"She's right, <<1>>. We simply don't know who <<2>> is or what he wants."
"115740052-0-24357";"The other thief? Surrender, all of you! The Iron Wheel is relentless. We serve a higher calling than gold or riches."
"115740052-0-24358";"What? He seemed the type to talk all day."
"115740052-0-24359";"<<1>>! You aren't the only prisoner we freed. They're on shore and itching to come back to the Thieves Guild."
"115740052-0-24360";"Yes, yes. A charming reunion. Open the cage so we can go."
"115740052-0-24361";"Your time is precious now, I know. And valuable, most valuable."
"115740052-0-24362";"And you'd like some of it."
"115740052-0-24363";"You should really stop blaming Zeira for what happened."
"115740052-0-24364";"I'll blame who I like, thank you."
"115740052-0-24365";"<<1>>."
"115740052-0-24366";"<<1>>."
"115740052-0-24367";"You two are circling like injured wolves! <<1>> fooled everyone. We all understand! But save the knives for him, not one another!"
"115740052-0-24368";"You were exacting in cutting your ties to this life when you left. Yet your dealings with Silver-Claw did not abate. Why?"
"115740052-0-24369";"He's persistent and bad at taking hints."
"115740052-0-24370";"I keep hearing about the dowry heist, but nobody can share the details. How exactly did it fail?"
"115740052-0-24371";"<<1>> was the only survivor. Yet she avoids answering that very question. I find that curious."
"115740052-0-24372";"She lost friends, <<1>>. That pain can linger."
"115740052-0-24373";"Do we knew where this <<1>> is from? His connections to Abah's Landing?"
"115740052-0-24374";"I didn't know <<1>> was a ""him."" Not until we raided the Iron Wheel's headquarters."
"115740052-0-24375";"Why do you two always fight? Was it a man? A woman?"
"115740052-0-24376";"She thought …."
"115740052-0-24377";"<<1>> and I don't fight. We … disagree. Fundamentally. On many, many things."
"115740052-0-24378";"Your loss is a hidden blessing."
"115740052-0-24379";"My what?"
"115740052-0-24380";"Have you even seen a camel before? We don't have any horses, or unicorns or whatever you were used to at home."
"115740052-0-24381";"Oh, that's all right. My family only owned three unicorns, and just one was trained. I never even got to ride him."
"115740052-0-24382";"You once asked me about … Saroldo, was it? I think I met an elf with that name."
"115740052-0-24383";"You did? Where? When?"
"115740052-0-24384";"Keep watch this, lookout that, I'm sick of it. Why won't Zeira give me something important to do?"
"115740052-0-24385";"There's a cult of militant fanatics turning this town upside down to find us, but watching them's not important enough for Quen."
"115740052-0-24386";"That's not what I meant …."
"115740052-0-24387";"I'll prove it. Last one to the top of the cistern cleans the canal."
"115740052-0-24388";"Stop talking to me like I'm some sort of child. I was among the top of my class at the Academy!"
"115740052-0-24389";"Needlepoint and etiquette don't count as prior experience."
"115740052-0-24390";"<<1>>! It's so good to see you."
"115740052-0-24391";"Stay out of my things!"
"115740052-0-24392";"Stop blaming <<1>>. Thieves don't steal from each other. You must have misplaced it—look again."
"115740052-0-24393";"What's her problem? I didn't touch anything. Wait … it was you? No. You didn't!"
"115740052-0-24394";"Is this what it used to be like? The Thieves Guild, I mean."
"115740052-0-24395";"Look at her. She nearly said ""in the old days."""
"115740052-0-24396";"It was very much the same … only the guild was much larger, we had a different guildmaster, and the Iron Wheel wasn't after any one of us."
"115740052-0-24397";"You've been quiet. Did you have any more questions about <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24398";"No. What's to ask? He betrayed the Thieves Guild to work with some merchant lord."
"115740052-0-24399";"You all spoke of Nicolas as if he was a friend. I would envy to command such loyalty, yet he has discarded it! Tossed it out! Spat upon it!"
"115740052-0-24400";"A mound of gold is narrowest at the top. Maybe we were foolish to think we'd all stand upon it?"
"115740052-0-24401";"That's the sad truth."
"115740052-0-24402";"Excuse me?"
"115740052-0-24403";"Stay out of my things."
"115740052-0-24404";"Zeira, what was Nicolas like? Before he, you know."
"115740052-0-24405";"Cocky, self-assured … brilliant. He got the better of us because he was good."
"115740052-0-24406";"You wouldn't ever steal from me … would you?"
"115740052-0-24407";"Never more than you could spare."
"115740052-0-24408";"Not many would have fled the life you had."
"115740052-0-24409";"That wasn't living … it was waiting."
"115740052-0-24410";"Have you seen Quen? She has been gone some time."
"115740052-0-24411";"Not since she got into the fruit basket."
"115740052-0-24412";"This place feels so empty without <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24413";"I'm surprised <<1>> didn't want to be acting guildmaster."
"115740052-0-24414";"Did they not teach you the meaning of ""retired"" at your academy?"
"115740052-0-24415";"Twice, a thane offered his hand in marriage after I punched him. I've never fallen climbing. I was blessed by the queen at my birth."
"115740052-0-24416";"Hmm, you are better at this than I thought."
"115740052-0-24417";"Only one is supposed to be a lie, Quen. I'll bet you've never even seen the queen."
"115740052-0-24421";"Ouch … the sun here is murder on my ears!"
"115740052-0-24422";"I use a balm of desert succulents and dragon frog oil."
"115740052-0-24423";"What are you babbling about?"
"115740052-0-24424";"Helpful as the hands of Elinhir. You are helpful as the hands of Elinhir. Helpful as the hands of Elinhir?"
"115740052-0-24430";"Two. Two sprigs of thistle!"
"115740052-0-24431";"Wha—I, sorry, two sprigs—and then? I can't breathe. Velsa!"
"115740052-0-24432";"It's good I wasn't trying to sell it. You are dissatisfied?"
"115740052-0-24433";"Nobody's buying that story of yours. Quen maybe."
"115740052-0-24434";"There are so many beggars and poor here. Don't the merchant lords see the city falling into squalor?"
"115740052-0-24435";"That is what marble walls and gilded gates are for. They exist in a world all their own."
"115740052-0-24436";"I rescued you from the Iron Wheel. You will always owe me, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24437";"I know, <<1>>. I can't thank you enough."
"115740052-0-24438";"You've really proven yourself. There's a place for you here, if you want it."
"115740052-0-24439";"You—you mean that, not just saying it because I stuck around for the hard times?"
"115740052-0-24444";"Your agreement with <<1>> is wonderful for business. Spotless Goods is most profitable!"
"115740052-0-24445";"I always wondered why you named it that."
"115740052-0-24446";"Oh, this should be good. And why is that?"
"115740052-0-24449";"I could never be a pirate."
"115740052-0-24450";"That will be all the excitement for a while, I guess. I hope. Does that mean you're finally going to return home to your villa?"
"115740052-0-24451";"As opposed to what? Continuing soaking up the damp with the rest of you?"
"115740052-0-24452";"It … pains me to say this, but you're always welcome here."
"115740052-0-24453";"This is pointless. Most of the Iron Wheel have already returned to Taneth."
"115740052-0-24454";"Which means there are less of them around to guard their pay."
"115740052-0-24455";"<<1>>, think. If we empty their coffers completely, they can't buy passage by ship. How will they ever leave Hew's Bane?"
"115740052-0-24456";"The other day, I passed <<1>> on the street. He made a strange motion with his hand."
"115740052-0-24457";"He did the same thing to me. What do you suppose it meant?"
"115740052-0-24458";"I convinced him we have a ""thief salute."""
"115740052-0-24460";"<<1>> has been too happy, lately. I don't trust it."
"115740052-0-24463";"We rescued her from the Iron Wheel. Of course she's happy."
"115740052-0-24464";"I think <<1>> is more concerned that her barbs no longer stick in <<2>>'s hide."
"115740052-0-24465";"You're evading. Why did you send your protege halfway across Tamriel?"
"115740052-0-24466";"She doesn't want to speak of it, <<1>>. Leave her be."
"115740052-0-24467";"I sent my ""protege"" to deal with <<1>>. He will no longer trouble the Thieves Guild."
"115740052-0-24468";"Never forget where you're from, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24469";"I don't. What about you? Where are you from?"
"115740052-0-24470";"Remarkable. As though the outfit chose you."
"115740052-0-24471";"Hard to miss you in that."
"115740052-0-24472";"All right, it's open. Come on in."
"115740052-0-24473";"My father gave me that book when I was a child! At his last visit, he took it to have it re-bound. Why is it in this woman's home?"
"115740052-0-24474";"I gave that to my father after a holiday in Skywatch. He kept it with him for luck. What is it doing here?"
"115740052-0-24475";"I found something, too—a necklace with an old key. My father wore this, wherever he went! And if there's a key, there must be a lock …."
"115740052-0-24476";"You! Why do you have my father's things?"
"115740052-0-24477";"Tu'whacca's breath! Saroldo's daughter stands before me. Why are you in Abah's Landing instead of your academy?"
"115740052-0-24478";"I'm looking for my father! Why do you know who I am?"
"115740052-0-24479";"My dear child … he's gone. When the Iron Wheel came for him, he fled to the rooftops. They gave chase and he fell. I'm so sorry."
"115740052-0-24480";"Good work. Come, we should speak somewhere private."
"115740052-0-24481";"I'll be outside."
"115740052-0-24482";"Cheer up, we'll find a way. People who drink while wearing fancy jewelry might cause great alarm when they notice it missing."
"115740052-0-24483";"Falorah simply must see my new … locket? Where's my locket? Someone stole my locket! Guards! Guards!"
"115740052-0-24484";"Problems already? They should have watered down the drinks."
"115740052-0-24485";"I wish I could pull that off. Too many jangling bits. The moment I climbed a wall, I'd be my own alarm bell."
"115740052-0-24486";"<<1>>? You weren't supposed to be here!"
"115740052-0-24487";"<<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24488";"This is all wrong! They weren't supposed to hurt anyone!"
"115740052-0-24489";"Wait! Get back here!"
"115740052-0-24490";"Those were <<1>>'s mercenaries! What were they doing here?"
"115740052-0-24491";"Bit of a mess, here. Maybe the clerk can tell us what happened?"
"115740052-0-24492";"I don't think mine will fit you. Come along, we'll work something out."
"115740052-0-24493";"Would you happen to have a spare set of boots?"
"115740052-0-24494";"<<1>>? I'll get you to Prince's Gate, safe and sound."
"115740052-0-24496";"Keep it down! Do you want everyone to hear?"
"115740052-0-24497";"It doesn't matter. This <<1>> demanded I come alone to <<2>>."
"115740052-0-24498";"The Iron Wheel's headquarters? How is he involved with … no, don't tell me, best you meet him before the Iron Wheel sends soldiers after us both."
"115740052-0-24499";"Then how did this ""<<1>>"" know of our business?"
"115740052-0-24500";"I have no idea. But if you can't deliver warm bodies, I'll find another supplier."
"115740052-0-24501";"Then pray I return from <<1>>. If <<2>> is connected to the Iron Wheel, we're both doomed."
"115740052-0-24502";"Shh! Did you hear something?"
"115740052-0-24503";"A lot of servers coming from the palace kitchens. Maybe they have a key?"
"115740052-0-24507";"That's all we need, partner. Let's find <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24508";"Welcome to my home! I must thank all of you for joining me on this momentous occasion."
"115740052-0-24509";"That's <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-24510";"<<1>> is <<2>>?"
"115740052-0-24511";"Please, eat and drink your fill! Soon, I shall speak to you not as a humble merchant, but as a noble of Taneth!"
"115740052-0-24512";"The palace is crawling with Iron Wheel. Lead the way—we'll follow from the shadows."
"115740052-0-24513";"I'm with you. Come on."
"115740052-0-24514";"Who are you? How did you get in here?"
"115740052-0-24515";"I recognize them from Sulima Mansion! Why are they digging?"
"115740052-0-24516";"<<1>>, we came to warn you. <<2>> is not the man he seems."
"115740052-0-24517";"He's a merchant lord of Abah's Landing. That's one step above the scum they scrape from ship hulls. Is there any other grand revelation before I call the guards?"
"115740052-0-24518";"If you can barely stand him, then what does it hurt to hear us out? Go on, partner. Tell her."
"115740052-0-24519";"You're lying!"
"115740052-0-24520";"No, child. I grieve for him every day. He was the only person I ever loved."
"115740052-0-24522";"In all truthfulness, I have no knowledge. A friend? But … you have no friends. Beyond my humble and mercantile self, of course!"
"115740052-0-24523";"I have indulged this madness for long enough."
"115740052-0-24524";"Magnifica Falorah, are you almost ready? The guests are assembling within the palace!"
"115740052-0-24525";"<<1>> is indisposed! She'll be ready in just a moment."
"115740052-0-24526";"Do you intend to keep me here? Look around, there's nowhere to go."
"115740052-0-24527";"From what I've learned of <<1>>, he'd never let himself be cornered. We should look for hidden passages."
"115740052-0-24528";"Are you there yet?"
"115740052-0-24529";"We're still moving! Keep holding the panel!"
"115740052-0-24530";"Well done! Come on, let's go."
"115740052-0-24533";"Well, well. A portion of the dowry <<1>> decided not to return?"
"115740052-0-24534";"And this must be Danobia's crown. <<1>>, you've doomed yourself."
"115740052-0-24535";"Here we go. Don't wander, or the darkness itself will flay you alive."
"115740052-0-24536";"We made it. That must be the vase. Sorry, ""<<1>>."""
"115740052-0-24537";"Bring the ashes. We should return to <<1>> and <<2>>."
"115740052-0-24538";"And now, to restore my fortunes from my humble shop. It is near the docks—you can't miss it! Well, you can easily miss it, it is hard to find. But you are always welcome!"
"115740052-0-24539";"You could practice thinking with your mouth closed."
"115740052-0-24540";"<<1>>! I'd recognize your grating voice anywhere. How is your retirement? Seems there are some troubles from which you can't run away."
"115740052-0-24541";"It's very relaxing, ""guildmaster."" Did you know I named a weed after you? It grows taller than it should, and takes more water than its share from the plants around it."
"115740052-0-24542";"That's hard to believe. You were never the type of person to get your hands dirty."
"115740052-0-24543";"Oh, it's true! The danizeira weed thrives in the dark. I take great pleasure in cutting it down to size, every day."
"115740052-0-24544";"There's <<1>> … but I don't see <<2>>."
"115740052-0-24545";"Today, Lord <<1>> of Abah's Landing joins with <<2>>, the Jewel of Taneth."
"115740052-0-24546";"Stop! There is no honor in this union!"
"115740052-0-24547";"<<1>>? You're alive? I … that is … what is the meaning of this?"
"115740052-0-24548";"More importantly, why do you have the desecrated remains of my ancestor?"
"115740052-0-24549";"The Iron Wheel is approaching. We have to leave, now!"
"115740052-0-24550";"<<1>>, take everyone into custody. I want this mess sorted."
"115740052-0-24551";"No! It's too late for <<1>>. We need to go, now."
"115740052-0-24554";"Empty. Search the room. Look for anything that stands out."
"115740052-0-24555";"There's someone coming!"
"115740052-0-24556";"Then I shall look forward to our next, most auspicious meeting!"
"115740052-0-24557";"See if you can find <<1>>. It should be a vase of some kind, full of sacred ashes."
"115740052-0-24558";"Edda? Daldur? What happened to their bodies? And where is <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24559";"Lift with your legs! Not your back, you fool!"
"115740052-0-24563";"This one sealed the door as soon as she arrived, but it will not hold forever."
"115740052-0-24564";"Just as I remember her."
"115740052-0-24565";"The dro-m'Athra are pouring through the breach. I know some by name and some by reputation. Some Adara'hai even called friends. Var var var …."
"115740052-0-24566";"Be cautious and keep watch for this Abbot, Kulan-dro. If he dances the Bent Dance, he will likely try to deceive us. Namiira's most dangerous servants are all honey and lies. Don't trust him."
"115740052-0-24567";"Let the hunt begin!"
"115740052-0-24568";"Your evil ends here, vampire. Prepare to die."
"115740052-0-24569";"Zalar-do has been destroyed."
"115740052-0-24570";"Meet me at the entrance to these caverns, once you're certain all of the vampire's victims have been accounted for."
"115740052-0-24571";"I am … wounded. I must … withdraw."
"115740052-0-24572";"Ziss ra'ham! This one feels Namiira's eyes on us already. The Lost Cats are nearby. Be wary."
"115740052-0-24573";"Ah—the Twilight Cantor arrives at last. And you brought allies! What a welcome surprise."
"115740052-0-24574";"Shut your ears, friends. His words are poison!"
"115740052-0-24575";"""Friends?"" Oh, come now. Friendship is for dogs and children. You are warriors, yes?  And warriors deal in a single currency: power."
"115740052-0-24576";"And so, the yowling begins …. I had hoped to avoid this farce, but I see now that it's inevitable. Sing, Cantor. Sing your throat dry. When you rasp out that last verse, I'll be waiting."
"115740052-0-24577";"He is gone. Moons be praised.  You will keep moving, yes? This one will follow as soon as she can."
"115740052-0-24578";"Ah, I see it now. You warriors come in search of a true challenge, yes? I can offer you that and so much more. Think on it. Zhaj'hassa, roll out the carpet, won't you?"
"115740052-0-24579";"What? My papers were here! Did they fall behind the …."
"115740052-0-24580";"Butcher of Bravil! This one claims your head!"
"115740052-0-24581";"Jone and Jode, that hurts!"
"115740052-0-24582";"That was a better death than that one deserved."
"115740052-0-24583";"We did well, my friend! Meet Raz back at the entrance after you recover the stolen items!"
"115740052-0-24584";"You there! A moment!"
"115740052-0-24585";"One of your companions will turn on you. I know because they told me so. Friendship is an illusion. A cruel joke. Let it go."
"115740052-0-24586";"We all have a vice, don't we? Is it greed? Lust ? Mmm … it's lust, isn't it? I can always tell."
"115740052-0-24587";"Your so-called friends conspire against you. They're jealous. And why shouldn't they be? You are obviously the strongest. They're holding you back."
"115740052-0-24588";"Why do you travel with these fools? Freeloaders and sycophants, the lot of them. Let them die and the glory will be yours alone!"
"115740052-0-24589";"Your persistence is commendable, if misguided. Would it not be easier to simply give in?"
"115740052-0-24591";"Surrender, thief! The manor is surrounded. Today, the Iron Wheel brings you to justice."
"115740052-0-24592";"What? Who are you?"
"115740052-0-24593";"<<1>>. We foiled your attempt to steal <<Ac:2>>. Will you also confess to stealing <<3>>'s dowry?"
"115740052-0-24594";"What's a ""falorah""?"
"115740052-0-24595";"She's right you know. Zhaj'hassa was a ruler without peer—lord of a shining kingdom. It was Namiira who gave him this. Name your hearts' desire, warriors, and I will see that you have it!"
"115740052-0-24596";"Silence, at last …. Go on. This one just … just needs a moment."
"115740052-0-24597";"Remember, don't leave my side or the Iron Wheel will think you're an intruder. Which by all accounts you are."
"115740052-0-24598";"Almost there. Once you're inside the prison, you're on your own."
"115740052-0-24599";"You still refuse to join our dance? It's the tempo, isn't it? Perhaps an allegro is more to your liking …."
"115740052-0-24600";"You there! Unlock the door and allow my companion entry to the prison. Do not record this in the log."
"115740052-0-24602";"We're approaching the Sanctuary. Vashai and S'kinrai used it as a dojo before …. The twins have probably fallen into the Bent Dance. Be cautious."
"115740052-0-24604";"I'm Kurog, king of the Orsimer."
"115740052-0-24605";"We will rebuild Orsinium."
"115740052-0-24606";"Whoever dares oppose the uniting of the Orc clans will feel my wrath."
"115740052-0-24607";"Welcome to my war!"
"115740052-0-24608";"Is this one of the outsiders who responded to my invitation?"
"115740052-0-24609";"My son needs someone at his side who has nothing to prove."
"115740052-0-24610";"Quick, hide in that box. I set up some distractions so they won't stay long. Maybe we'll hear something useful."
"115740052-0-24611";"You still think me a doddering priest? I am so much more!"
"115740052-0-24612";"There are only two ways out of this temple, warrior—as a servant or as a corpse."
"115740052-0-24613";"Did I mention I'm afraid of spiders? Probably should've mentioned. I'll keep it under control."
"115740052-0-24614";"Look, a crypt! Nothing bad ever happens in a crypt."
"115740052-0-24615";"On the bright side, these only have four limbs."
"115740052-0-24616";"Do you honestly think sanctifying those seals will matter? Are you really that naive?"
"115740052-0-24617";"And why feign concern for that wretched Cantor? You don't care about what happens to her—or this place. Why continue? You've had your inane adventure. Just move on."
"115740052-0-24618";"I offer you eternal glory, and still you flail like petulant children. Lured by promises of a few trinkets and a handful of coin, no doubt. Pitiful."
"115740052-0-24619";"If you value your pathetic mortal lives, you'll turn back now. You have been warned."
"115740052-0-24620";"Leave me be! I need to figure out my future in this clan. Or if I have a future."
"115740052-0-24621";"You brought that mutt of yours? After the scene she made at the last wedding?"
"115740052-0-24622";"<<1>> is no mutt! She simply has a nose for the finest meats. And this time I'm keeping her far away from the food. She will be on her best behavior!"
"115740052-0-24623";"If we aren't thinking the same thing, neither of us deserves to be in the Thieves Guild. Come on, let's find some food for <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24624";"As you command. You there, follow me."
"115740052-0-24625";"Moons forgive us. These twins were … never mind. Just a few more verses, yes? Just a few …."
"115740052-0-24626";"Iron Wheel uniforms aren't made for Argonian heads. I'd be sweating if … well, if I could sweat. You go after <<1>>. I'll wait for the others and escort them through."
"115740052-0-24627";"This one's head spins like a top. Hurry. I'll be … I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-24628";"That smells delicious. Let's see if the dog agrees!"
"115740052-0-24630";"Get off the table! Someone take the dog away before this one turns it into soup!"
"115740052-0-24631";"Do what you think is right, partner. I'll scout ahead."
"115740052-0-24632";"Kulan-dro is just beyond this door. I can feel it. The drums … the drums are rattling my teeth."
"115740052-0-24633";"We must be quick, yes? Adara'hai will do what she can to protect you, but this dro-m'Athra is stronger than any I have faced before. Bright Moons protect you."
"115740052-0-24634";"You'll be charged with desecrating <<c:1>>—a capital offense. Cooperate, and I'll argue leniency."
"115740052-0-24635";"<<1>>!"
"115740052-0-24638";"Let's find those keepsakes and get out of here before someone notices us."
"115740052-0-24639";"There's one more thing before we go."
"115740052-0-24640";"Anais and I used to sit on the balcony and watch the sun set. I'd like to see it one more time before we put this memory behind us."
"115740052-0-24641";"Ah, just the way I remember it. So beautiful."
"115740052-0-24643";"Anais and I would sneak out here and watch the sun set. It was the best of times!"
"115740052-0-24644";"And yet you ran away. You betrayed me and left me all alone. Is that how a beloved pet is supposed to behave?"
"115740052-0-24645";"Anais, I didn't …. You weren't supposed to be here."
"115740052-0-24646";"You were my friend! We were going to do so many things together! And then you ran away like a thief in the night. And that's how you come back to me? Stealing my possessions?"
"115740052-0-24647";"What are you saying? I don't understand …."
"115740052-0-24648";"You've changed, Anais. Either that, or I've been fooling myself this whole time. Goodbye, my old friend."
"115740052-0-24649";"Goodbye? I don't think so. Even if you escape from the mansion, my agents will find you and bring you back to me. You're mine, now and forever!"
"115740052-0-24650";"Meet me back at <<c:1>>. We can talk there."
"115740052-0-24651";"There! The second seal. Wait …."
"115740052-0-24652";"My son needs someone at his side who has nothing to prove."
"115740052-0-24653";"My son needs someone at his side who has nothing to prove."
"115740052-0-24654";"Over here! Quickly, before we're seen!"
"115740052-0-24655";"I'm Kurog, king of the Orsimer."
"115740052-0-24656";"I'm Kurog, king of the Orsimer."
"115740052-0-24657";"We will rebuild Orsinium."
"115740052-0-24658";"We will rebuild Orsinium."
"115740052-0-24659";"Whoever dares oppose the uniting of the orc clans will feel my wrath."
"115740052-0-24660";"Whoever dares oppose the uniting of the orc clans will feel my wrath."
"115740052-0-24661";"Welcome to my war!"
"115740052-0-24662";"Welcome to my war!"
"115740052-0-24664";"Don't …. It's … trap. He's coming!"
"115740052-0-24665";"This one is still alive! Ease your mind, brother. Adara'hai will—"
"115740052-0-24666";"Oh no …. Take cover!"
"115740052-0-24667";"Zhaj'hassa …. He was once a great king of cats. Now …? What a waste."
"115740052-0-24668";"My darling Volu, is that you in the kitchen? My muse has left me. Perhaps kisses would restore it?"
"115740052-0-24669";"I thought my shift would never end … wait, who are you?"
"115740052-0-24670";"Don't hurt me! I'm not even an officer!"
"115740052-0-24671";"No. Not like this!"
"115740052-0-24672";"<<1>>, for the third time—I hear your concerns."
"115740052-0-24673";"And ignore them, at your peril."
"115740052-0-24674";"The invitation will be ready in no time at all."
"115740052-0-24675";"A pleasure, <<1>>. I always enjoy dressing you up."
"115740052-0-24676";"Then you should come by my mansion later to collect your payment. Have I mentioned my husband is away?"
"115740052-0-24677";"Three times, in fact. My assistant will bring you the bill."
"115740052-0-24678";"This is … this is the last one, yes? Yes. Just a bit farther …."
"115740052-0-24679";"Your songs are powerless, Cantor. Do you hear me? Like the chirping of crickets in a howling tempest! Listen to me, cat! Listen to me!"
"115740052-0-24680";"<growling and wincing in pain.>"
"115740052-0-24681";"These seals … they are not enough. We must go to the High Lunarium. It is just a bit farther. Lead on, walker …."
"115740052-0-24682";"<<1>>? There's something you need to see."
"115740052-0-24683";"Here you are. Worst of luck to you."
"115740052-0-24684";"We had best hurry. The ship may sail on the next tide."
"115740052-0-24685";"Search the Warden's Office. Look for any clue that leads us to <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24686";"As for the rest of you—I'm naming you as part of my Thieves Council. I'll need those I can trust in the coming months. Yes, even <<1>>. ""Councilor emeritus,"" if it suits you."
"115740052-0-24687";"This calls for a drink. Or five. Where's <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24688";"Huzzah. Meaningless titles."
"115740052-0-24689";"Don't be so … well, you."
"115740052-0-24690";"My apologies for interrupting. Your … ""Lord <<1>>"" escorted me here?"
"115740052-0-24691";"I'll have to celebrate later. Opportunity waits for none of us, whatever title we have."
"115740052-0-24693";"If we end up splitting up, we can meet back in Abah's Landing!"
"115740052-0-24695";"Ogres. This mountain is crawling with them. Filthy brutes. When our task is done, you must remember to clean your armor, yes?"
"115740052-0-24696";"<<1>> requests <<2>> call upon her at the earliest convenience."
"115740052-0-24697";"You almost had him! Is it time for thievery? Oh, I know! The wealthiest people make the loudest noise when they notice valuables are missing."
"115740052-0-24698";"Tough crowd. Why not lift something valuable from one of the guests? When they notice it's missing, it'll cause a scene."
"115740052-0-24699";"As expected. Come on, let's find the drunkest person here and lift something valuable. It's like I'm thirty again."
"115740052-0-24700";"Now we begin our spying? Oh, too loud again, so sorry."
"115740052-0-24701";"After seeing <<1>>'s outfit, I am still the best dressed among us."
"115740052-0-24702";"I have so many things to say about <<1>>'s outfit. Later, when we're back in <<c:2>>."
"115740052-0-24703";"What would you have us do? Stare at one another until your return?"
"115740052-0-24704";"What does it matter to you? Aren't you retired?"
"115740052-0-24705";"I was at that wedding. <<1>> was a calamitous distraction. Perhaps we can recreate it here!"
"115740052-0-24706";"Semi-retired. And what would you suggest? Hold hands and sing songs?"
"115740052-0-24707";"That poor thing hasn't had a good meal in quite some time. Let's see about finding <<1>> something she can't turn away."
"115740052-0-24708";"What a fool. Mutts are the ones you want to keep around. Let's find a way to give <<1>> what she wants."
"115740052-0-24709";"Delicious, all of this. Let's see what the dog thinks."
"115740052-0-24710";"Oh, that will do. Let's see if the dog agrees."
"115740052-0-24711";"Acceptable. More than acceptable for the mutt."
"115740052-0-24712";"The servers … are they coming from inside the palace? Perhaps they have a key? A guess, of course … I could be wrong."
"115740052-0-24713";"Everyone forgets about the staff, yet they often have the most access to the palace grounds. Take those servers. I bet they have keys on them."
"115740052-0-24714";"The servers are bringing food from the palace kitchens. Easy enough to nab their keys."
"115740052-0-24715";"Hardly. The only tune you know is ""grating."""
"115740052-0-24716";"I think I'm starting to like you."
"115740052-0-24717";"We are masterful at this! Well, you are, but I do enjoy every bit of this. Come, let's tell <<1>> what we learned!"
"115740052-0-24718";"Never thought I'd say this, but that's enough mingling. Let's find <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24719";"Reminds me of the old days. Speaking of which, let's find <<1>> and inform her we've done far more work than she."
"115740052-0-24720";"Please, give us a chance to convince you. Before you close any deal, you must do all you can to learn if it is a bad one."
"115740052-0-24721";"Advice is free. Good advice is worth its weight in … say … your dowry. You'll want to hear what we have to say."
"115740052-0-24722";"You are <<1>>. Your political power rivals the queen of Taneth herself. Do not allow ""<<2>>"" to diminish you."
"115740052-0-24723";"But, what of the hidden passages <<1>> mentioned? There might be another way out, yes?"
"115740052-0-24724";"Does anyone else feel a draft in this windowless, enclosed room? Must be a hidden passage."
"115740052-0-24725";"Unless <<1>> selected a bedroom with a hidden passage. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-24726";"The wedding is about to begin! But where is <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24727";"This doesn't feel right. Where is <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-24728";"What foolishness is <<1>> planning?"
"115740052-0-24729";"The Iron Wheel! Look, behind us! Should we be going?"
"115740052-0-24730";"The Iron Wheel is behind us. If we're going to leave, we should do it now."
"115740052-0-24731";"<<1>>, you fool! You're drawing the Iron Wheel to the room!"
"115740052-0-24732";"They have <<1>>. We should go before they arrest us, too!"
"115740052-0-24733";"It's too late for <<1>>. Let's go. It's what she wanted."
"115740052-0-24734";"Always playing the martyr. Come on, there's still time for us."
"115740052-0-24735";"That could have gone better."
"115740052-0-24736";"The Iron Wheel has <<1>>. Aren't we going to do something?"
"115740052-0-24737";"Not until we know where they have her. But we will, I promise you that."

"115740052-0-24750";"Over here. Sorry, I panicked."
"115740052-0-24751";"Hunted. Missing too many dead friends."
"115740052-0-24752";"Ah, <<1>>. So good to see you again. How have you been?"
"115740052-0-24753";"I'm someone who knows better than to listen to your lies."
"115740052-0-24754";"And I thought you were dead. Seems we were both disappointed."
"115740052-0-24755";"And <<1>> as well? I thought you'd retired!"
"115740052-0-24756";"And … who are you? I don't believe we've met."
"115740052-0-24757";"Might I say, you are the most magnificent Magnifica I've ever met? You elevate the cesspit of Abah's Landing with your very presence."
"115740052-0-24758";"Who are you, again?"
"115740052-0-24759";"But a humble Argonian who looks forward to comparing ledgers."
"115740052-0-24760";"Iron Wheel, secure all exits! None shall leave the palace grounds. Question everyone here. Be thorough!"
"115740052-0-24761";"It's stuck! Hmm … try lifting the gate while I turn the winch?"
"115740052-0-24762";"Oh no. My Lady will be furious when she sees these spots."
"115740052-0-24763";"What is she doing? I … don't remember things like this. Or am I remembering wrong? What happened since I left?"
"115740052-0-24764";"Wake, wake, my darling. You can sleep when you're dead—which will be sooner than you think."
"115740052-0-24765";"What? Who are you? What are you doing in my room?"
"115740052-0-24766";"A better question would be, ""Are you here to kill me?"""
"115740052-0-24767";"Guards! Guards!"
"115740052-0-24768";"The answer, of course, is most definitely, ""Yes."""
"115740052-0-24769";"And that saves me the trouble of alerting the castle's defenders."
"115740052-0-24770";"Do me a favor, hero, and make sure someone notices you on your way out."
"115740052-0-24771";"Yes? Who's there? Oh dear, this one must have fallen asleep again."
"115740052-0-24772";"Murder! Murder in the castle! The Dark Elf noble is dead! Assassin in the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-24773";"Narahni, are you all right? I specifically stated that you were not to be disturbed!"
"115740052-0-24774";"Easy, my friend. This one has decided that the time has come to travel and mend old wounds."
"115740052-0-24775";"The letter bore fruit? I wish you well, but we're going to miss your pies around here."
"115740052-0-24776";"Could you open a portal to Abah's Landing, my friend? A long journey always makes this one's old bones ache."
"115740052-0-24777";"Gladly, but I can't keep it open for long. The innkeeper doesn't like me using magicka in here."
"115740052-0-24778";"This one will write to you. And I'll even sign the letter this time!"
"115740052-0-24779";"Of course. Now give me a moment to concentrate."
"115740052-0-24780";"Come, my new friend, let's take this portal to Abah's Landing. If you dislike portal travel, then make your own way and meet me there."
"115740052-0-24781";"So good to see you, my friend. Sometimes portals can be tricky."
"115740052-0-24782";"Did you find out who sent that letter? Not that I was overly concerned …."
"115740052-0-24783";"Someone who lacked the courage to sign their name, but now wants to make amends."
"115740052-0-24784";"Narahni! Is it really you? Just the sight of you opens old wounds …."
"115740052-0-24785";"Oh, Velsa. I know what you saw, what you must have thought. This one never meant to hurt you."
"115740052-0-24786";"I saw you in my brother's arms! He was the worst of my family! How could you?"
"115740052-0-24787";"He arrived at exactly the wrong moment. I had to do something or our entire plan would have failed."
"115740052-0-24788";"You … you didn't betray us? You … did that for … me?"
"115740052-0-24789";"It was the only way to guarantee your escape."
"115740052-0-24790";"I let the years flow by without giving you a chance to explain. What a waste! But I'll make it up to you. I'll keep you safe."
"115740052-0-24799";"Back to the tomb? Your plan is to relive the guild's greatest failure?"
"115740052-0-24802";"My plan is to get the Iron Wheel's boot off our necks!"
"115740052-0-24803";"Off to find <<1>>. Meet you there, partner."
"115740052-0-24804";"Everyone else, pack for a long journey. I'll bring us home safe and sound."
"115740052-0-24805";"More promises you can't keep."
"115740052-0-24806";"This is your only chance to consider my proposal. Work for me, or else."
"115740052-0-24807";"Or else what?"
"115740052-0-24808";"Or I hand these documents to the Iron Wheel. They do so frown on slavery and skooma peddling. Take a moment to consider your options."
"115740052-0-24809";"What the …. Shor's bones, the stench!"
"115740052-0-24810";"There is another minor request … hardly a trifle. Perhaps we can discuss it over drinks?"
"115740052-0-24811";"Ah, my larcenous friend! Quickly, we must speak!"
"115740052-0-24812";"Jone's mercy … Kulan-dro, what's happened to you? Kulan-dro!"
"115740052-0-24813";"Have you not heard me? Have I not made your choice plain? You will listen, mortals … even if it means peeling the ears from your scalps and shouting Namiira's will into whatever's left of your broken skulls!"
"115740052-0-24814";"We've drawn out the beast! Courage, friends!"
"115740052-0-24816";"You see, <<1>>? Your protege returns, having survived the ""invulnerable"" Iron Wheel. You should have more faith."
"115740052-0-24817";"Everyone, clear the room."
"115740052-0-24818";"Ruin, pain, and shadow! Die, fools! Die!"
"115740052-0-24819";"An imposing door. Wonderful."
"115740052-0-24820";"How are we supposed to get through?"
"115740052-0-24821";"Ask <<1>>. She knows how to do everything in this place, unless it's stealing a dowry."
"115740052-0-24822";"No idea. Last time, <<1>> had me watch the passage behind us. There must be something in his journal."
"115740052-0-24823";"Anything useful?"
"115740052-0-24824";"<<1>> loved his puzzles. You're welcome to try."
"115740052-0-24825";"The journal says this chasm is called ""Shinji's Truth."" Last time, we never made it across."
"115740052-0-24826";"I can't see the bottom. Is there a bottom?"
"115740052-0-24827";"Throw yourself in. We'll see how long before we hear the splat."
"115740052-0-24828";"<<1>>, <<2>>—look for hidden doors or switches. <<3>>, you're with me. I need your help to walk Malooc's Path."
"115740052-0-24829";"And what of your protege?"
"115740052-0-24830";"Watching my back, should anyone try to stab it. Let's go."
"115740052-0-24831";"The beast is slain! Stand away, friends! This might get loud."
"115740052-0-24832";"<Adara'hai sings final verse>"
"115740052-0-24833";"Forgive me, my old friends."
"115740052-0-24834";"What did you say?"
"115740052-0-24835";"Nothing. <<1>>, do you see that panel? Put your hand on it until I say otherwise."
"115740052-0-24836";"For what reason?"
"115740052-0-24837";"When I set foot on Malooc's Path, an aura of light will surround me. The darkness cannot harm us as long as you touch the panel."
"115740052-0-24838";"So … what can harm you?"
"115740052-0-24839";"We could fall to our deaths. Or the creatures within could devour us."
"115740052-0-24840";"Well, then. Enjoy yourselves."
"115740052-0-24841";"<<1>> knows what to do. But we should speak before we cross."
"115740052-0-24842";"It's done … Moons be praised."
"115740052-0-24843";"There's no end to the darkness."
"115740052-0-24844";"<<1>>? My arm's getting tired!"
"115740052-0-24845";"Don't you dare release that panel!"
"115740052-0-24846";"<<1>>! One of the statues gave me a funny look!"
"115740052-0-24847";"Don't antagonize it!"
"115740052-0-24848";"Does everyone else see how stunning my date is? Good!"
"115740052-0-24849";"<<1>>, it's a bad idea."
"115740052-0-24850";"Words escape me."
"115740052-0-24851";"Someone, tell me what I'm seeing."
"115740052-0-24852";"We heard strange noises in the chasm. Stone grinding against stone. <<1>>, well …."
"115740052-0-24853";"I found this invisible bridge!"
"115740052-0-24854";"So you followed my advice and threw yourself in the chasm."
"115740052-0-24855";"The ashes! Spread them on the bridge to see where it leads. And <<1>>, get back from there."
"115740052-0-24856";"Clear the way! We'll be right behind you!"
"115740052-0-24857";"You look amazing."
"115740052-0-24861";"Thought you could outclass my outfit? Well … you came close."
"115740052-0-24862";"You're late. We should hurry."
"115740052-0-24863";"Make it quick."
"115740052-0-24868";"Vantus! Or <<1>>. Whoever you are, you are no longer welcome!"
"115740052-0-24869";"I needed no prayers. Only my strength."
"115740052-0-24870";"My darling Volu, I can explain!"
"115740052-0-24871";"Thank you. I won't squander this."
"115740052-0-24872";"I had an unexpected visitor today. Nothing to worry about, and they are leaving. \n\nYou and I should relax and have a nice glass of wine. I have some of that nice Colovian vintage breathing."
"115740052-0-24873";"What was that noise? What's going on in here?"
"115740052-0-24874";"Vantus? No!"
"115740052-0-24875";"That's it! I knew we'd make good partners."
"115740052-0-24876";"That winch is a problem. One moment …."
"115740052-0-24877";"Ah, dark and dusty! Just like the secret passages from my youth. You go ahead. This one needs a moment."
"115740052-0-24878";"Papers, signed by <<1>>? What are those doing here?"
"115740052-0-24879";"<<1>> had a disguise kit, just like this one. In fact … this is his disguise kit."
"115740052-0-24880";"Ancient Yokudan coins, stamped with a likeness of Danobia. Those must be from the dowry."
"115740052-0-24881";"Another missing page from the journal. It shows the secret exit from the treasure vault."
"115740052-0-24882";"Narahni, you must be tired after the journey. Relax and we'll talk later. I know we have so much to tell each other."
"115740052-0-24883";"Wait … that lamp belonged to <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24884";"I watched it go out. I heard him die!"
"115740052-0-24885";"Falorah must have come here to investigate. She could have picked it up and brought it here."
"115740052-0-24886";"<<1>> couldn't have survived. Could he?"
"115740052-0-24893";"What's wrong with that skeleton?"
"115740052-0-24894";"Missing its head? Looks like it was hacked off. Must have been done by whoever stole the dowry … but why desecrate a skeleton?"
"115740052-0-24895";"Let me see that."
"115740052-0-24896";"<<1>> used half-maps like this—thin overlays placed atop existing maps. You line them up with common points of reference."
"115740052-0-24897";"That page, is it from the journal <<1>> kept?"
"115740052-0-24898";"""Tu'whacca watches over you."" The pass-phrase for the crypt guardian? I nearly had it!"

"115740052-0-24901";"Did you hear a click? I heard a click! Come on, let's go find the <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24902";"The sentries are Windhelm Guard, on loan from someone important. If they give chase, find a hiding spot."
"115740052-0-24903";"The water, between the two grates? Full of slaughterfish."
"115740052-0-24904";"Sky's Edge Tavern, just outside town. We can talk there."
"115740052-0-24905";"What the… ! Teris will have my head for losing that cat!"
"115740052-0-24906";"Can't have gotten very far!"
"115740052-0-24907";"Is that … my mother?"
"115740052-0-24908";"Oh, happiness, oh, joy! First Velsa and now my Tashmin."
"115740052-0-24909";"This one never should have stayed away so long."
"115740052-0-24911";"Your mother has missed you. Welcome to our home, Tashmin."
"115740052-0-24912";"Let's head to the manor—quick and silent."
"115740052-0-24913";"Hmm. Lockpicks won't work on those doors. Some sort of mechanism, maybe?"
"115740052-0-24914";"Whoa! That's one clever thane. But not clever enough."
"115740052-0-24915";"There it is! It's so … shiny."
"115740052-0-24916";"She … it doesn't matter. Return the <<1>> and surrender, or face the consequences."
"115740052-0-24917";"No idea what he means. I'll … I'll follow your lead."
"115740052-0-24918";"It's fine I'm … I'm fine."
"115740052-0-24919";"Over here. We should speak."
"115740052-0-24920";"""Throw the apple"" was too complex for you? This way …."
"115740052-0-24921";"Ah, you return! With good news, I hope!"
"115740052-0-24922";"Rise, shadows, and bare your fangs!"
"115740052-0-24923";"Prowlers in the dark, make a feast of them!"
"115740052-0-24924";"Tear them asunder! I command it!"
"115740052-0-24925";"You are nothing! Nothing! Kindle and burn!"
"115740052-0-24926";"You will remember me! Remember …."
"115740052-0-24927";"We are suffering."
"115740052-0-24928";"We are fear."
"115740052-0-24929";"S'Kinrai's moon sets.The reaping moon rises."
"115740052-0-24930";"Vashai's moon sets. The blood moon rises."
"115740052-0-24931";"The cup of anguish is full. Drink deep and despair."
"115740052-0-24932";"The maelstrom approaches. Your soul is forfeit."
"115740052-0-24933";"My associate has returned with the reply from your mansion. Would you like to hear it?"
"115740052-0-24935";"Oh joy. Here she is."
"115740052-0-24936";"Nura-jhahul! Mine is the crown of ash and shadow. Kneel …."
"115740052-0-24937";"Good! Then grab a mop and scrub algae off all the planks you can find."
"115740052-0-24938";"You …. Fine. But it's just going to grow back."
"115740052-0-24939";"Oh, the algae never loses. But it's all about the struggle."
"115740052-0-24940";"<<1>>, we all have a story. What brought us here, why we do what we do."
"115740052-0-24941";"So what's your story?"
"115740052-0-24942";"Private, for now. Trust is earned, especially among thieves."
"115740052-0-24943";"I don't understand. Who would you be?"
"115740052-0-24944";"Simpler. Less certain of my purpose. And in dire need of good clothes."
"115740052-0-24946";"I know! Isn't it wonderful?"
"115740052-0-24947";"That isn't the word I'd use."
"115740052-0-24948";"""Exceptional,"" then. We are in complete agreement."
"115740052-0-24949";"Why does Abah's Landing stink?"
"115740052-0-24950";"Take any harbor town, with the normal fish stenches. Add swampland, the hot sun, and filthy pirates."
"115740052-0-24951";"I didn't realize pirates had a particular smell."
"115740052-0-24952";"Nothing, you just … you remind me of someone I once knew."
"115740052-0-24953";"I remind you of someone who owned a pet?"
"115740052-0-24954";"It's the way you speak, not the words you say. No matter, you are a very different person."
"115740052-0-24955";"You are not who I expected to see."
"115740052-0-24956";"I … see. Then what do I call you? Acquaintance, associate … neighbor?"
"115740052-0-24957";"Accomplice."
"115740052-0-24959";"I don't know why I bother."
"115740052-0-24960";"Neither do I."
"115740052-0-24961";"Glad you're back, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-24962";"Wonderful. It's good to know where I stand with …. What's that?"
"115740052-0-24963";"These? A gift! Seeds, for your new garden. I thought you might miss your old one."
"115740052-0-24964";"<<1>> …. Thank you."
"115740052-0-24965";"Recondite and eternal."
"115740052-0-24966";"My father. He used to work with the guild, but the Iron Wheel found him. He's … he didn't …."
"115740052-0-24967";"Drown in shadow."
"115740052-0-24968";"Burn in light."
"115740052-0-24969";"Ah … a sad thing, child. Remember the best times. They are all that matter."
"115740052-0-24971";"You never cared for anything beyond your garden. No, I think it's something else."
"115740052-0-24972";"I don't care what you think."
"115740052-0-24973";"These souls are weak. Hollow."
"115740052-0-24974";"How could you do this? My dear husband … oh, Vantus! Come back to me, my love! Come back to me!"
"115740052-0-24975";"Break them."
"115740052-0-24976";"Pathetic husks."
"115740052-0-24977";"Like straw before the scythe."
"115740052-0-24978";"Jode will burn."
"115740052-0-24979";"Jone will rot."
"115740052-0-24980";"Namiira speaks."
"115740052-0-24981";"I could hear their screams as I held the switch. I had to do something, I couldn't …."
"115740052-0-24982";"This is a dead end. Let's turn back. There must be another way we missed."
"115740052-0-24983";"The word is death."
"115740052-0-24984";"At least that hasn't changed. With you, I know where I stand."
"115740052-0-24985";"Am I not a part of this strange family? Perhaps a distant cousin?"
"115740052-0-24986";"This family is hunted by the Iron Wheel. It's better if you aren't related."
"115740052-0-24987";"Of course, of course … ah! I am the guild's neighbor, who provides tea and honey-cakes."
"115740052-0-24988";"You see? All that ""academy training"" you go on about. It sticks to you like boiled horse tendons."
"115740052-0-24989";"You mean glue. It sticks to me like glue."
"115740052-0-24990";"There's that prissy academy girl! Shows us you know more than us lowly guttersnipes. Nothing to say? Cat glue your tongue? Hmph."
"115740052-0-24991";"All the Thieves Guild trembled before his mercantile prowess, serving at his beck and call!"
"115740052-0-24993";"Samples her own mushrooms, I see."
"115740052-0-24994";"Can you honestly see <<1>> doing what <<2>> did? Playing them against each other like squabbling children?"
"115740052-0-24995";"I'm not certain, yet. I'm waiting to see how she handles you."
"115740052-0-24996";"Ransom? Is that your plan? My steward is under strict orders not to negotiate with kidnappers."
"115740052-0-24997";"He said, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""That's preposterous. She's not worth half that much."""
"115740052-0-24998";"That old goat! With me out of the way, he's probably hoping to take over the business! Have you contacted my mother?"
"115740052-0-24999";"They scramble as rats do."
"115740052-0-25000";"She's in Wrothgar this time of year, isn't she? Discussing trade agreements? We don't have time to reach out to her."
"115740052-0-25001";"Vermin. Worthless."
"115740052-0-25002";"Untie me and we can forget all about this, Walks. For old time's sake. Are you listening to me?"
"115740052-0-25003";"Life is disease."
"115740052-0-25004";"The cure is pain."
"115740052-0-25005";"My point exactly. We know almost nothing about him."
"115740052-0-25006";"Then we should learn more. We can all can agree on that, yes?"
"115740052-0-25007";"Everyone lost friends. And she's the guildmaster. She can't hide behind that."
"115740052-0-25008";"No. But she carries the loss with her. And she will, until the day she dies."
"115740052-0-25009";"Have you thanked <<1>> for her part in that?"
"115740052-0-25010";"Do you really think I'd make it that easy for her to gloat?"
"115740052-0-25011";"Good. I didn't think you had, I was making sure you had no plans to do so."
"115740052-0-25012";"Disagreements rarely have such volume."
"115740052-0-25013";"In Abah's Landing, it's best to keep your disagreements loud. Helps warn your friends when someone pulls a knife."
"115740052-0-25014";"The warehouse? Your true fortune is freedom from the ties that bound you to it."
"115740052-0-25015";"Are you trying to sell me a warehouse?"
"115740052-0-25016";"No, of course not. But if I were, how much would you pay?"
"115740052-0-25017";"Vashai's moon sets.The slaughter moon rises."
"115740052-0-25018";"Well, good. You can handle the camel then?"
"115740052-0-25019";"Hah, of course I can handle the camel. Bumpkin."
"115740052-0-25020";"She could have said it like you did."
"115740052-0-25021";"Years ago. He had a gift he wanted shipped to the Summerset Isles. A doll, I think—was it a dragon frog? A very pleasant man. Warm smile."
"115740052-0-25022";"Thank you, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-25023";"You're welcome, child. May it give you peace."
"115740052-0-25025";"Reckless ambition has lost us much and lost us many friends. The wounds are still fresh."
"115740052-0-25026";"No no, not another word, your grace. I'd better find something special for the princess to do."
"115740052-0-25027";"That's not what I … well, no …."
"115740052-0-25028";"You want to race me, to prove how mature you are?"
"115740052-0-25029";"She commandeered my quarters. They are still technically mine. Don't tell her, all right?"
"115740052-0-25030";"Not for all the gold in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-25031";"So you're saying it was quite different."
"115740052-0-25032";"Only the most superficial aspects. Just like then, we remain a family."
"115740052-0-25033";"Stay there! I'm coming back for you!"
"115740052-0-25035";"There are heists to plan and merchant lords to rob. See you in <<c:1>>."
"115740052-0-25036";"Not without redress, of course! It's just …  the Thieves Guild did good business with me, before—though I did not know it at the time …."
"115740052-0-25037";"And you'd like to continue that arrangement."
"115740052-0-25038";"Just so! A reader of minds, you are! A good trait in a business partner."
"115740052-0-25039";"At least you two have that in common."
"115740052-0-25040";"She actually blames me for Nicolas?"
"115740052-0-25041";"No. She blames herself."
"115740052-0-25042";"I was going to ask <<1>> if she had any spare chalk."
"115740052-0-25043";"I … I think I have some. Why don't I get that for you. Right now …."
"115740052-0-25044";"Yet you could have avoided him if you chose. Why stay in Abah's Landing at all?"
"115740052-0-25045";"You think I stayed here for him? Ha!"
"115740052-0-25046";"I think you gave up too much and were glad to find something returned."
"115740052-0-25047";"That doesn't … bother you?"
"115740052-0-25048";"Of course it does. But why dwell on it? What is there to do but move on?"
"115740052-0-25049";"We'll move on by paying him back."
"115740052-0-25050";"Is gold so precious? I enjoy fine things, but to cast aside friendship … I would sooner beg in the street!"
"115740052-0-25051";"That's easy to say when you've never had to beg, Silver-Claw."
"115740052-0-25052";"Why would I touch your things?"
"115740052-0-25053";"No excuses. My things are off-limits. If you touch them, I'll know."
"115740052-0-25054";"You're a thief in the Thieves Guild. Why indeed?"
"115740052-0-25055";"You admired him."
"115740052-0-25056";"I did. I still might. Clever bastard … I just wonder if all the good things he did were part of the act."
"115740052-0-25057";"I … know the feeling."
"115740052-0-25058";"You wouldn't! But—oh, haha, you're pulling my tail … or are you? I can't tell!"
"115740052-0-25059";"Your worrying must be poor for your health. It might do you well to worry less about it."
"115740052-0-25060";"Oh—no no. Good business keeps me in most robust health, I assure you!"
"115740052-0-25061";"Like an itchy excess skin, hanging onto your inner self."
"115740052-0-25062";"I … suppose so?"
"115740052-0-25063";"That's disgusting!"
"115740052-0-25064";"We have a fruit basket?"
"115740052-0-25065";"No, we have my last batch of stink apples."
"115740052-0-25067";"Even <<1>>'s bickering feels empty without <<2>>."
"115740052-0-25068";"Your moping does you no favors, either."
"115740052-0-25069";"Powdered my bottom and everything. Ha, that part was a lie, but try again."
"115740052-0-25070";"To climb so high, one must learn to fall … but then again, Nords are very peculiar."
"115740052-0-25073";"Oh—I … hey, that's really something. Thanks!"
"115740052-0-25074";"Don't mention it. Ever."
"115740052-0-25076";"Why would you ever need to practice that?"
"115740052-0-25077";"I am practicing Taneth expressions from my eavesdropping of the Iron Wheel."
"115740052-0-25078";"Because I have no idea what it means."
"115740052-0-25084";"That's just panic. You're fine until your tongue starts swelling."
"115740052-0-25085";"Can I please have the antidote, I'll never touff—oh, my. Velfa. Velfa!"
"115740052-0-25086";"I'm sorry, who's that?"
"115740052-0-25087";"Oh, do tell then, the story of me."
"115740052-0-25088";"Disappointed. The story's really lacking. A young boy abandoned at birth. So much wasted potential."
"115740052-0-25089";"Well, when a Man loves a Guar, something special happens …."
"115740052-0-25090";"But, they're the governors of this land, aren't they? They aren't really, are they?"
"115740052-0-25091";"It's a free port. One's only concern is one's self, or so is the belief."
"115740052-0-25092";"But we're different. We look out for our own."
"115740052-0-25093";"You … you what?"
"115740052-0-25094";"I said, ""thank you."" And I'll say it for the rest of your life."
"115740052-0-25095";"I don't know what your game is, but … stop that. It's unsettling."
"115740052-0-25096";"You may be new to the game, but I think you could show me a thing or two about acrobatics."
"115740052-0-25097";"Great! I mean, thank you, <<1>>. What's my first assignment?"
"115740052-0-25098";"Meet me at No Shira Citadel tomorrow morning. You're going to show me how to make a really dramatic escape."
"115740052-0-25105";"Oh? What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-25106";"It's just that you … your fur has all manner of …."
"115740052-0-25107";"Oh! Ha! Yes, I can see how it might be confusing. I named it in honor of my mentor, Golden-Fang—she was quite sleek."
"115740052-0-25108";"Have you ever seen what salt water does to good clothing?"
"115740052-0-25109";"Back! Back, I said!"
"115740052-0-25110";"I don't believe I have. Let's experiment."
"115740052-0-25111";"Hmph, well … when you invariably find yourselves in over your head again, you know where to look."
"115740052-0-25112";"Aww, that was almost sweet."
"115740052-0-25113";"We leave them just enough to purchase camels?"
"115740052-0-25114";"That could work. All right, <<1>>—go over your plan once more …."
"115740052-0-25115";"You did not!"
"115740052-0-25116";"I thought it was an obscene gesture, so I returned one of my own. I should stop by his shop and apologize."
"115740052-0-25117";"You're right, now that I think of it. It doesn't matter what <<1>> says, she's just … placid."
"115740052-0-25118";"It won't last. It can't last, can it?"
"115740052-0-25119";"Oh. Well … this calls for some wine, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-25120";"I'd like that."
"115740052-0-25121";"Abah's Landing. This town was like a mother to me."
"115740052-0-25122";"You're saying Abah's Landing loves you?"
"115740052-0-25123";"It tried to convince me the only person I can count on is myself. Good thing I never listened to what it told me."
"115740052-0-25125";"When you're up to it, we'll head to <<Ac:1>>. It's in an old cistern."
"115740052-0-25126";"A cistern? Wonderful. I'm to be surrounded by water, everywhere I go."
"115740052-0-25127";"You did bring lockpicks, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-25128";"Mind the shadows! They are stirring up the void!"
"115740052-0-25129";"Something is churning on the other side of the breach … we must hurry!"
"115740052-0-25130";"There's the lucky lad. Real lucky, of late. Be a shame if you had a sudden change of fortune."
"115740052-0-25131";"Whatever you heard, it's not true! I'm just scraping by! Here, look—barely enough for a meal and a bed!"
"115740052-0-25132";"Hmph, fine—keep your scraps. I find out you're holding out on me, you'll cough up more than coin."
"115740052-0-25133";"You ever planning to pay for those tools we bought you?"
"115740052-0-25134";"It— it's not that easy. I'm still an apprentice! I— I've made some, I just need more time."
"115740052-0-25135";"Hand it over. Ought to buy you a few days. Don't start slacking off."
"115740052-0-25136";"Burn!"
"115740052-0-25137";"No, it's nothing. Forget I mentioned his name."
"115740052-0-25138";"Already done. Er, what was the name to forget? Unless … yes, that is the point, I see."
"115740052-0-25140";"Meet me near the stables, by the north gate. We can talk there."
"115740052-0-25141";"Meet me near the south gate! We can talk there."
"115740052-0-25142";"Anais! I'm so glad we found you. And all in one piece, too!"
"115740052-0-25143";"No thanks to you! You left me tied up on the docks! What did you think was going to happen? I demand you escort me home—immediately!"
"115740052-0-25144";"Right. Of course. I … I just need a moment to confer with my associate."
"115740052-0-25145";"Of course you do. Just let me know when you're ready to get me out of here. These pirates have no appreciation of soap and water."
"115740052-0-25146";"I'm going to leave you here, Anais. It's the only way to teach you a lesson about the difference between people and property."
"115740052-0-25147";"I'll get you out of here, Anais. I just hope this helps you realize the difference between people and property."
"115740052-0-25149";"The void prevails."
"115740052-0-25150";"No! You will be consumed! You will …."
"115740052-0-25151";"We have so much to catch up on, my dear, sweet son. Come, let us talk."
"115740052-0-25152";"You will kneel before Zhaj'hassa!"
"115740052-0-25153";"Behold, the fate of all traitors."
"115740052-0-25154";"No, I understand. If you change your mind, I'll be here."
"115740052-0-25155";"Or die!"
"115740052-0-25156";"An explosion! Run, to the nearest tavern!"
"115740052-0-25157";"Gods! That smell, it's attracting the dragon frogs! They'll burn down the warehouse!"
"115740052-0-25158";"You said I was the daughter you never had. Well, you're a liar. You'll get nothing from me but contempt."
"115740052-0-25159";"I don't care. It's your life, and I will have no part in it."
"115740052-0-25160";"Please! I won't be safe in my own home! What am I to do?"
"115740052-0-25161";"Living with fear … you lie, you steal … you worry if the ones you love can accept what you've become. Of course I forgive you, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-25162";"Oh, my dear child! I don't deserve your forgiveness."
"115740052-0-25163";"Hush, now. I'll bring you to a place where you'll be safe. It's where I live—and where you will, too."
"115740052-0-25164";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-25165";"Let's go find some treasure!"
"115740052-0-25166";"I … my strength is spent. Bare your fangs and bring him down!"
"115740052-0-25167";"Enough! This ends now!"
"115740052-0-25168";"This temple—this world is ours!"
"115740052-0-25169";"The void is about to erupt! Now, friends! It must be now!"
"115740052-0-25171";"Time to dip our daggers in Sermonizer blood."
"115740052-0-25172";"Watch your back, New-blade."
"115740052-0-25173";"Grand Sermonizer, have you discovered the location of the Sanctuary yet?"
"115740052-0-25174";"Unfortunately, this assassin expired before revealing anything useful."
"115740052-0-25175";"I'll capture another. Try not to kill this one before we learn the location of the Dark Brotherhood's lair."
"115740052-0-25176";"Lord Akatosh, hear our prayer! Let me just prepare the body … like so."
"115740052-0-25177";"New-blade! Come quietly and listen. Our quarry stirs below."
"115740052-0-25178";"Now's our chance. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-25179";"She tortured Cimbar! Such an insult to the family cannot stand!"
"115740052-0-25180";"At least he knew how to hold his tongue."
"115740052-0-25181";"What foul magic is this? New-blade … beware … I feel … so weak …."
"115740052-0-25182";"Argh! I can't … move …."
"115740052-0-25183";"Two assassins? I didn't know they came in pairs."
"115740052-0-25184";"With the proper motivation, you will reveal the location of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary."
"115740052-0-25185";"The Black Dragon admires your kind, but I don't see what the attraction is."
"115740052-0-25186";"This is … unexpected. But I refuse to die here!"
"115740052-0-25187";"I said the food is not ready! Now go, before I beat you with a spoon!"
"115740052-0-25188";"I just wanted some chicken!"
"115740052-0-25189";"I'm just going to sit here and see who comes for me first, Sithis or Tall-Papa."
"115740052-0-25190";"Tanek! Are you planning to just lay down and die?"
"115740052-0-25192";"They knew we'd come for Cimbar. Trapped his body with some kind of foul death magic."
"115740052-0-25193";"Get up, you milk-drinker! Sithis still has work for you to do."
"115740052-0-25194";"Initiate! The Grand Sermonizer is yours! I'll get Tanek home."
"115740052-0-25195";"Defend me, knights of the Order of the Hour! Show this assassin the true power of Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-25196";"Trust in Akatosh! Let the Dragon God guide your strikes!"
"115740052-0-25197";"Murder me if you must. It won't save your Dark Brotherhood!"
"115740052-0-25198";"It seems I'll need to use something harsher than words to deal with you."
"115740052-0-25199";"Lord Akatosh, my spirit is yours!"
"115740052-0-25200";"It feels odd being back here. Let's not linger."
"115740052-0-25201";"Quickly now, search the courtyard and kitchens. Then meet me in the family wing of the mansion."
"115740052-0-25202";"Don't worry, Tanek. A cask of mead and you'll be back on your feet in no time!"
"115740052-0-25203";"Your mead tastes like bee vomit. Think I'll pass."
"115740052-0-25204";"Oh, Tanek! I hate that this happened to you."
"115740052-0-25205";"You worry more than the Matron, Hildegard. I'll be as good as new before you know it."
"115740052-0-25206";"Ah, the New-blade has arrived. Give us the room if you would, Kor."
"115740052-0-25207";"Certainly, Tanek. But I still expect you to be completing contracts again in a few days."
"115740052-0-25208";"I'll do my best not to disappoint you."
"115740052-0-25209";"Take your time, Tanek. I'm going to go say a prayer for your quick recovery."
"115740052-0-25210";"My amulet's in there. Would you mind getting it? There's a young Argonian in there. He … unsettles me."
"115740052-0-25211";"Our quarry cowers in her family's estate outside Kvatch. I'll meet you there, New-blade. And if you really want to impress the Matron, kill a few more Sermonizers along the way."
"115740052-0-25213";"You choose death. So be it!"
"115740052-0-25214";"Wait … did you hear that?"
"115740052-0-25215";"The Black Dragon's chambers are behind that door. Follow me."
"115740052-0-25216";"You blinded yourself with sentiment. Made <<1>> the father you never had. But he was a thief! Always a thief."
"115740052-0-25217";"You're right, <<1>>. But what matters now is what we do next."
"115740052-0-25218";"There must be a pattern. Try another combination!"
"115740052-0-25219";"Setting a trap for the Dragon? Is that the idea?"
"115740052-0-25220";"Don't mourn for me, Assassin. I've always dreamed of the Void."
"115740052-0-25222";"Wait, who's that with you?"
"115740052-0-25223";"We'll meet again, assassin. And next time I'll be ready to deal with you!"
"115740052-0-25224";"I am death, you silly fool!"
"115740052-0-25225";"Caravan master, please! The young woman with the flower in her hair. She's in terrible danger!"
"115740052-0-25226";"Well look at you! You must be the brother!"
"115740052-0-25227";"So you did see Hildegard! Please, you need to tell us where she's gotten to."
"115740052-0-25228";"You're all she talked about, other than begging me for transport. Said she was going to miss you most of all."
"115740052-0-25229";"Word on the docks was that the Silver Dawn was looking for my Sister, too. We need to know where she went."
"115740052-0-25230";"The young woman wanted a ride to the Jerall Mountains. Sent her on the last wagon, but I can take you there if that would help."
"115740052-0-25231";"We'd appreciate that. Thank you."
"115740052-0-25233";"Sorry. I protect my customers and their secrets. I've got nothing else to say to you."
"115740052-0-25234";"Guards! Take these intruders into custody!"
"115740052-0-25235";"I think it's time to leave, don't you? Quickly, now!"
"115740052-0-25236";"Let's split up and look for Hilde. But stay alert. The forest is probably crawling with Silver Dawn hunters."
"115740052-0-25239";"That's good, little Sister. Very good. Now breathe. Relax."
"115740052-0-25241";"You've made a big mistake this time, you … you … lizard! My agents will find me and then I'll have your hide for a hand-bag!"
"115740052-0-25242";"You follow Loche's trail on the street. I'll see if I can spot him from the rooftops. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-25243";"There it is! One moment and I'll have it open. I hope."
"115740052-0-25244";"There we are. Watch for traps in there. The Yokudans did love their traps."
"115740052-0-25245";"I'll get them to safety. You keep moving!"
"115740052-0-25246";"Come on! Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-25247";"I will get them to safety also. You keep moving!"
"115740052-0-25248";"Come on! Let's get out of here as well!"
"115740052-0-25249";"The door to the treasure vaults, just through this crypt. We made it."
"115740052-0-25250";"Do all crypts come with … whatever that is?"
"115740052-0-25251";"""Every tomb needs a guardian."" An old Yokudan saying, wasn't it?"
"115740052-0-25252";"Your introduction is formless and without grace. Recite Danobia's maxim!"
"115740052-0-25253";"That's alarming."
"115740052-0-25254";"<<1>>, <<2>>, <<3>>—stay back! If it's hostile, we'll handle it."
"115740052-0-25255";"Recite Danobia's maxim, or you shall be deemed trespassers!"
"115740052-0-25256";"It must be some kind of pass-phrase! If you have any ideas, now's the time to call them out!"
"115740052-0-25257";"You can't seriously expect us to—"
"115740052-0-25258";"""Falorah!"""
"115740052-0-25259";"Trespasser! Danobia's justice falls upon you!"
"115740052-0-25260";"What assurances do I have before I present your offer to the remaining Red Sails captains?"
"115740052-0-25261";"I guarantee your pirates will enjoy all the rights and privileges of the Order, but only so long as they remain righteous."
"115740052-0-25262";"And the pardons we were promised? Much of my crew is wanted for crimes throughout the Gold Coast and beyond."
"115740052-0-25263";"Everyone who joins the Order has their offenses absolved, both religiously and legally. We're about to initiate Captain Zayaz's crew now, by the way."
"115740052-0-25264";"That didn't go as planned."
"115740052-0-25265";"You're right. I honestly thought it would kill us all."
"115740052-0-25266";"Come on. Let's see what's in the treasure vaults."
"115740052-0-25267";"I'll take word of your fair offer to my crew—after I observe the initiation, if you're all right with that."
"115740052-0-25268";"Hurry! The Iron Wheel are on his trail!"
"115740052-0-25269";"Seriously, Quintus, I appreciate you providing a safe place for our meeting, but couldn't you have straightened up a bit before we got here?"
"115740052-0-25270";"My apologies, Governor Fortunata, but there's no safer place south of Varen's Wall than right here—vermin notwithstanding."
"115740052-0-25271";"I don't know, Fortunata. This place seems to suit you."
"115740052-0-25272";"That's no way to speak to your betters, Count Carolus. Speaking of which, when are you going to finally turn Kvatch over to a proper ruler? Your people deserve so much greater than you."
"115740052-0-25273";"My lord and lady, please! We have a more pressing concern and it affects us all!"
"115740052-0-25274";"Careful, Quintus. I won't be spoken to in such a manner. But you're right. The Dark Brotherhood grows stronger and threatens everything we've built here."
"115740052-0-25275";"I forgot to mention. Primate Artorius sends his regrets, but Cathedral business forced him to remain in Kvatch. He indicates that he will support whatever we decide."
"115740052-0-25276";"I rule Anvil with an iron glove, but you let that glorified priest walk all over Kvatch, Count Carolus."
"115740052-0-25277";"I govern while Artorius handles spiritual matters and the Cathedral's defenders, the Order of the Hour. I've allowed them to patrol Kvatch until the murderer is apprehended."
"115740052-0-25278";"Haven't the last few murder victims been suspected members of the Dark Brotherhood? Perhaps if we do nothing, this murderer will solve our problem for us."
"115740052-0-25279";"I refuse to allow a vigilante to freely stalk the streets of my city. That's why I allowed Artorius to expand the Order of the Hour's authority."
"115740052-0-25280";"If I didn't know any better, I'd think you and Artorius were building an army. Should I be worried, my dear Count?"
"115740052-0-25281";"Count Carolus, can we at least get your assurance that the Order will return to the Cathedral once this threat is resolved?"
"115740052-0-25282";"Primate Artorius gave me his word, and I give you mine."
"115740052-0-25283";"And why should I trust either of them, Quintus? What good is their word when I find the Order at Anvil's walls?"
"115740052-0-25284";"That won't happen, Fortunata. We're not as ambitious and ruthless as you."
"115740052-0-25285";"Despite his holy station, Artorius is a man. He has the same needs and desires as any other."
"115740052-0-25286";"Lord Quintus! Intruders have penetrated the estate. We need to move the three of you immediately!"
"115740052-0-25287";"Don't be alarmed, my friends. We've prepared for any contingency. Commander, secure the halls. Make sure no one follows us!"
"115740052-0-25288";"Of course, my lord. We'll find the intruders."
"115740052-0-25289";"Yes! I am here to rescue you. You sound surprised …."
"115740052-0-25290";"Heem-Jas? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-25291";"No! Well, yes—a little."
"115740052-0-25292";"You should head back to the village. My companions and I will free the rest of the tribe."
"115740052-0-25293";"I arrive too late. Kaoc. I guided the first group back to the swamp. You are free, friends. Flee this place."
"115740052-0-25294";"Well, I'm in. A wedding at <<1>>? Just imagine the spread!"
"115740052-0-25295";"The Black Dragon has struck again. Mirabelle is dead."
"115740052-0-25296";"This happened during the Assassin's mission? Did we learn anything or did Mirabelle die in vain?"
"115740052-0-25297";"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, look upon your child and smile. For the unworthy have been cleansed in blood and in fear."
"115740052-0-25298";"Step forward, loyal Sister."
"115740052-0-25299";"Who is that black-armored warrior? Some kind of mercenary?"
"115740052-0-25300";"Pay no attention to them. They are still in shock, I think. I will run ahead to scout out these ruins. I will try to leave a few Xit-Xaht alive so you can share in the glory."
"115740052-0-25301";"Narahni, you should have told me. Of course I'll find your son!"
"115740052-0-25302";"Oh no! This one doesn't want to be left alone to worry about you and Tashmin. Please. Stay here with me."
"115740052-0-25303";"Of course. Our friend here is capable of finding Tashmin. Everything will be all right."
"115740052-0-25304";"I'm the girl whose father died because of your schemes."
"115740052-0-25305";"<<1>>, stop pacing! You'll wear a rut in the floor."
"115740052-0-25306";"It helps me think! Now, where is the guildmaster? Or acting guildmaster? Or whatever you call it?"
"115740052-0-25307";"Dreet, Jaseen, we are … here to rescue you."
"115740052-0-25308";"It is Meema and Bun-Ti … are you all right? That was a savage beating."
"115740052-0-25309";"Look who's here! Your long wait is over."
"115740052-0-25310";"All according to plan. Now, the four of you should swim to safer waters. My companions and I will find the rest of the tribe."
"115740052-0-25311";"Yes, we will make for the marsh. But keep your bellies to the mud. They've woken up Mighty Chudan!"
"115740052-0-25312";"Mighty Chudan? It is nothing we cannot handle, right? Ha—ow."
"115740052-0-25313";"It is my honor, as a duly appointed officer of the Iron Wheel, to officiate their union."
"115740052-0-25314";"What is this? Guards!"
"115740052-0-25315";"There must be some mistake!"
"115740052-0-25316";"Falorah, my darling—I've been framed! I implore you to reconsider!"
"115740052-0-25317";"Give it a rest, <<1>>. Whining doesn't suit you."
"115740052-0-25318";"Quiet, thief! You'll have enough time to bicker from inside your cell. Take them away!"
"115740052-0-25319";"You go ahead. I'll abscond with our sentry friend's uniform. May need to trim it down … he was a rather brawny fellow."
"115740052-0-25320";"No! They'll find my skooma!"
"115740052-0-25321";"Say… we still have time. What about that dance? Please! Let's enjoy this before we get all thiefy. Come on!"
"115740052-0-25322";"Hah! We are masterful at this. Say, we still have time, and I really would love to try the food. Why not go grab something to eat?"
"115740052-0-25323";"I don't suppose we could maybe go visit one of the fountains before we continue this adventure? I'd still really like to see the rest of the manor."
"115740052-0-25324";"You! Why are you here?"
"115740052-0-25325";"So we could go run to Zeira, or we could go grab a drink. Yes, I'm offering to have a drink with you. Don't pass this up."
"115740052-0-25326";"Ah, this place is so lovely! This one can not thank you enough for all of this. Silver has longed to see such sights for so very long."
"115740052-0-25327";"I love this song! Come on!"
"115740052-0-25328";"Is that haj mota-stuffed bread? Oh, how I've longed to taste this delicacy!"
"115740052-0-25329";"Ah, you made it. I have searched high and low but I cannot find any sign of Xal-Nur or the elders. It is also very, very quiet."
"115740052-0-25331";"Could I bother any of you for a pillow? The ground is very cold. Afraid my rump may fall off."
"115740052-0-25332";"Perhaps some water to wash out the dye? Though I could make this work with a proper sash. Never mind about the water!"
"115740052-0-25333";"That either means the Xit-Xaht have fled, or they have gathered in great numbers to kill us all. I hope it is the second. I am filled with sap and fury."
"115740052-0-25334";"Here they come. Stab them until they fall down!"
"115740052-0-25335";"Another glorious victory. I just need a moment to gather my wits. And throw up. Keep looking for Xal-Nur. I will … be right behind you."
"115740052-0-25336";"Refresh your libations, citizens. The next fight is about to begin!"
"115740052-0-25337";"Smell the desperation? That's your clue that another Pardoner's Brawl is about to start!"
"115740052-0-25338";"Release the gladiators!"
"115740052-0-25339";"And who might you be?"
"115740052-0-25340";"They're off their leash and out for blood!"
"115740052-0-25341";"And we have our winners! Freedom is their reward!"
"115740052-0-25342";"What's this? New challengers have entered the arena! Cheer or boo, it's up to you!"
"115740052-0-25343";"The new arrivals are running away! Is that even allowed?"
"115740052-0-25344";"The challengers stand victorious! Hold on, the Arena Master is signaling for a main event. Now the real contest begins!"
"115740052-0-25345";"Challengers, prepare to face the champions of the Kvatch Arena—the Order of the Hour!"
"115740052-0-25346";"Look at them run! But who can blame them?"
"115740052-0-25347";"I don't believe it! The challengers have bested the Order of the Hour champ—no, I spoke too soon!"
"115740052-0-25348";"Knight Commander Panthius demands to meet these challengers in battle!"
"115740052-0-25349";"And what are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-25350";"Everyone, listen up!"
"115740052-0-25351";"The money. Now."
"115740052-0-25352";"Your problem, not mine. I see you again, I expect more than excuses."
"115740052-0-25353";"What money? You lot have bled me dry!"
"115740052-0-25354";"No—no! I'm only trying to win back what I owe you. I promise!"
"115740052-0-25355";"Ah, I … I'm sorry! My work just doesn't fetch much at market yet—but I'm learning!"
"115740052-0-25356";"I am here! You draw its attention while I … oh. Well, good job. I guess."
"115740052-0-25357";"It is Na-Kesh! We have killed your pet. Release the rest of the Su-Zahleel tribe, or suffer the same fate! That was good, right?"
"115740052-0-25359";"I always told my mother I'd find a man who'd work hard for me. I hope you have more than sweat and tears for me today."
"115740052-0-25360";"That won't do, love. That won't do at all. But since I'm so fond of you, I'll forgive you—this time."
"115740052-0-25361";"Better hope your luck's changed before my next visit."
"115740052-0-25362";"Word is, you're trying to gamble your life away."
"115740052-0-25363";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-25364";"I'll attend to that after my meeting with <<1>>. Do remember who holds your reins."
"115740052-0-25367";"<<1>>, good work freeing the prisoners. There are a few more on this ship—break them out and send them topside."
"115740052-0-25368";"Yes ma'am!"
"115740052-0-25369";"Good. We'll need them to strip this vessel and the docks of whatever they can carry. <<1>>?"
"115740052-0-25370";"Don't bark orders at me. I'll set traps near the prison door. Slow down any Iron Wheel come to check on the ship."
"115740052-0-25371";"Good thinking, <<1>>."
"115740052-0-25372";"Everyone, be quick about your work. Don't linger or we'll end up back in a cell."
"115740052-0-25373";"Once you have all you can carry, grab a boat and row hard for Abah's Landing. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-25374";"I almost had her … but Lyra was always a step faster than me …."
"115740052-0-25375";"I saw the Wrath of Sithis, Assassin. The Dread Father hunts her, too."
"115740052-0-25376";"Just like in … the old stories …."
"115740052-0-25378";"You're the blade of Sithis … kill her and the Dread Father … will claim her soul …."
"115740052-0-25379";"Apologies, Magnifica. We have much to discuss, when timing is more convenient for us both."
"115740052-0-25380";"""Pass-phrase!"""
"115740052-0-25381";"""Yokuda!"""
"115740052-0-25382";"""Gaiden Shinji!"""
"115740052-0-25383";"Idiots!"
"115740052-0-25384";"<<1>>, you aren't even trying."
"115740052-0-25385";"Friends! Our foolish cousin freed us but that beast, Xal-Nur, caught him. You must hurry!"
"115740052-0-25386";"For what? A comprehensive memory of my customers? Well, a good memory is its own reward."
"115740052-0-25387";"You picked the wrong manor, skeever face!"
"115740052-0-25388";"Taste my blade!"
"115740052-0-25389";"Die, trespasser!"
"115740052-0-25390";"Stand back, or I will …."
"115740052-0-25391";"Kill puny rat!"
"115740052-0-25392";"You there! Halt!"
"115740052-0-25393";"Intruder!"
"115740052-0-25394";"Not in our house, dog!"
"115740052-0-25395";"Finally! Something to kill!"
"115740052-0-25396";"A thief? A thief!"
"115740052-0-25397";"Protect the palace!"
"115740052-0-25398";"You dare attack the Iron Wheel?"
"115740052-0-25399";"Wrong party to crash, scum!"
"115740052-0-25400";"Alarm! Thieves!"
"115740052-0-25402";"They sent you to hunt me down? I suppose that's what happens when all the good assassins have already been eliminated."
"115740052-0-25403";"You'd kill me, Venom? You were my Brother once. Join me and forget your obligations."
"115740052-0-25404";"The Brotherhood is a pox. It deserves to be destroyed."
"115740052-0-25405";"The Brotherhood. The Order. I'm done being used, Venom. Just leave me alone!"
"115740052-0-25406";"Turn back! I don't want to kill you!"
"115740052-0-25407";"You are a determined one, I'll give you that. You must have really bought into the Brotherhood's lies."
"115740052-0-25408";"I believed the lies once, when they told me we were family. Then they made me kill them."
"115740052-0-25409";"What did the Brotherhood give me? Nothing but guilt and shame."
"115740052-0-25410";"The Order? They offered me redemption. But in the end it was just more lies."
"115740052-0-25411";"And you know whose lies hurt the most? Primate Artorius."
"115740052-0-25412";"Artorius isn't as pious as he pretends. You know, he even had me murder his beloved mentor."
"115740052-0-25413";"And now I killed Green-Venom-Tongue, too."
"115740052-0-25414";"And here we are. I'm ready to die. Let's see if you're good enough to kill me."
"115740052-0-25415";"I wonder, if we betray the Brotherhood, does the Wrath of Sithis really claim our souls?"
"115740052-0-25416";"Primate Artorius manipulated all of us. He led us to this cliff. Will you leap and continue to follow his lies?"
"115740052-0-25417";"I told Artorius the location of your Sanctuary. Brema was good enough to reveal it to me before I slit her throat."
"115740052-0-25418";"You remind me of who I was. That's why I'm going to kill you."
"115740052-0-25419";"If not redemption, then let me have battle!"
"115740052-0-25420";"At least in combat, the lies we tell are pure!"
"115740052-0-25421";"I'm impressed, Assassin."
"115740052-0-25422";"Knight Commander Panthius and his enforcers will lay down the law! And the penalty is death!"
"115740052-0-25423";"The Knight Commander's enforcers are the Order's most battle-hardened veterans. The challengers are doomed!"
"115740052-0-25424";"The beasts are hungry! The challengers will give the walls a wide berth unless they want to become a meal."
"115740052-0-25425";"How many cages are down there? If the challengers keep trying to climb the walls, we might find out!"
"115740052-0-25426";"They've done it! They've dropped the axe on Knight Commander Panthius!"
"115740052-0-25427";"You have a bounty on your head—try to keep away from the Guard!"
"115740052-0-25428";"It looks like the challengers have been judged and found wanting! Another crushing victory for the Order of the Hour!"
"115740052-0-25429";"I had him by the short spines. I know it did not look like it, but feigning panic is a excellent way to set an opponent off guard. Anyway … thank you."
"115740052-0-25430";"Keep moving. We are near to finding the Tree-Minder and the elders, I know it."
"115740052-0-25431";"This is a nice change of scenery from <<c:1>>."
"115740052-0-25432";"First time I've been inside <<1>>. This place is a bit of a fortress."
"115740052-0-25433";"Let's hurry—I want to get a good look at <<1>>. See for myself what kind of spineless marionette would dance for <<2>>."
"115740052-0-25434";"That's something <<1>> would say."
"115740052-0-25435";"I haven't walked these marshes in a long, long time. Strange, but it doesn't feel like coming home."
"115740052-0-25436";"And I'd like to see the face of the man who stole my warehouse! Er, ahem. Something in my throat."
"115740052-0-25437";"Do we have time to stop for food? No? It's all right, I can wait."
"115740052-0-25438";"Have you never looked in a mirror?"
"115740052-0-25439";"Everyone, I require your attention!"
"115740052-0-25440";"Yes, it is me. I just need to …. Kaoc. I will tend to this one. Save the others!"
"115740052-0-25441";"This is it. Stay close—let's see if <<1>> makes an appearance."
"115740052-0-25442";"It is an honor and privilege to introduce our host for the evening. May I present the impending husband of <<1>> … Lord <<2>>!"
"115740052-0-25443";"Velsa? You can let go of the panel."
"115740052-0-25444";"I know what you did."
"115740052-0-25445";"What?"
"115740052-0-25446";"I know how they died. How you killed them."
"115740052-0-25447";"That's low, <<1>>. Even for you."
"115740052-0-25448";"Always had to be the hero. Be the guildmaster's darling."
"115740052-0-25449";"We needed you to pull this off. You abandoned us!"
"115740052-0-25450";"So that's <<1>>? His voice is oilier than his hair!"
"115740052-0-25451";"You held the panel. From here you saw the creatures, closing in. You thought you could save them. Only you."
"115740052-0-25452";"But I thought …. So that means …. Oh, no."
"115740052-0-25453";"Well … he's better dressed than I remember."
"115740052-0-25454";"Not if we can help it, you s'wit."
"115740052-0-25455";"You're cracked. I didn't need anyone's approval."
"115740052-0-25456";"So you released the panel. Grabbed your weapon. Rushed out to meet them."
"115740052-0-25457";"I could have saved them!"
"115740052-0-25458";"Because in your head, you are the hero."
"115740052-0-25459";"But the light faded. The darkness rushed in, and ate them alive."
"115740052-0-25460";"I tried to reach them!"
"115740052-0-25461";"And the darkness tried to eat you alive. So you had to recover from your wounds. That's why you didn't return to Abah's Landing—at least, not soon enough."
"115740052-0-25462";"I crawled from the tomb. The darkness … you can't imagine the pain …."
"115740052-0-25463";"You were the only one who could have warned the guild. Who could tell them the Iron Wheel was coming."
"115740052-0-25464";"<<1>> … stop."
"115740052-0-25465";"<<1>> … you were never the hero—you were always a thief. Now?"
"115740052-0-25466";"You're just a shadow."
"115740052-0-25467";"Look, closely. There's a hollow crystal with …. Is that blood inside? Whose blood?"
"115740052-0-25471";"Lyra? Is something wrong, Sister?"
"115740052-0-25472";"I'm sorry it's come to this, Brother."
"115740052-0-25473";"What are you doing? No, Lyra. Stop!"
"115740052-0-25474";"The elders are safe. Now we end this! We … oh. It is done then."
"115740052-0-25475";"Traitor? I'm not the one who betrayed my Brothers and Sisters!"
"115740052-0-25476";"The Black Hand would never sanction this! I don't believe it!"
"115740052-0-25477";"You don't need to believe it. You simply need to die."
"115740052-0-25478";"It is time to make this witch pay. You attack from the right! I will …"
"115740052-0-25479";"Wait, Lyra. You know me. I'd never betray the Brotherhood!"
"115740052-0-25480";"I do know you, Annalise. But my orders are clear."
"115740052-0-25481";"Please! There has to be another way!"
"115740052-0-25482";"If only that were true."
"115740052-0-25483";"Goodbye, Sister."
"115740052-0-25484";"What? Are those tears? Executioners aren't supposed to cry, Lyra."
"115740052-0-25485";"You really believe that? Even now, you think this … insanity has some sort of meaning?"
"115740052-0-25486";"Come. Plunge your blade into my heart. If Sithis calls for me, I will gladly leap into the Void. When we are called, we must obey!"
"115740052-0-25487";"Purpose and meaning are illusions for the masses. But we know the truth, Lyra. Now, strike and send me home!"
"115740052-0-25490";"If only that were true."
"115740052-0-25491";"Nicolas would disagree."
"115740052-0-25492";"Hist bless you …. More of our shell-kin are through that gate. Please save them!"
"115740052-0-25493";"Thank you! Should you ever redesign your thieves garb, ask for my consultation."
"115740052-0-25494";"Drop your picks, friends. It is time to leave this place. Quickly, follow me."
"115740052-0-25495";"Do your worst, fool of a hunter!"
"115740052-0-25496";"I grow weary of your interference, hunter!"
"115740052-0-25497";"I thought we would never escape …. You must hurry. More of our tribesmen are trapped inside the ruins. Please, save them!"
"115740052-0-25498";"Queen Ayrenn's mangy cat? Again?"
"115740052-0-25499";"I should have chopped off your tail the last time we met!"
"115740052-0-25500";"They are all dead? Good. Keep your tails low. One of their strongest is just ahead."
"115740052-0-25501";"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear."
"115740052-0-25502";"Did it work? Yes, it must have. I performed the ritual just as described, night after night. And now you're here."
"115740052-0-25503";"I suppose there's no turning back. I have to go through with this, for the people of Kvatch. Fortunata must be stopped."
"115740052-0-25504";"What are you waiting for? Get in there and kill those murdering deviants!"
"115740052-0-25505";"If you're going to follow me anyway, why don't you come and help me figure out how to open these doors?"
"115740052-0-25506";"The Matron sent you, didn't she? Wants to make sure I don't botch the kill? Very well. I don't mind the company."
"115740052-0-25507";"This place was once important to the Order of the Hour, back when the group was first founded."
"115740052-0-25509";"These braziers will open the doors, but I haven't been able to figure out the proper sequence to ignite them. Maybe you'll have better luck."
"115740052-0-25510";"These statues are similar to the ones we passed on the stairs. I wonder if that's significant?"
"115740052-0-25511";"Maybe it has something to do with their rank or length of service to the Order?"
"115740052-0-25512";"Do you remember which statue you encountered first when you descended the stairs?"
"115740052-0-25513";"Brotherhood dogs! This ends now!"
"115740052-0-25514";"You have meddled in our affairs for the last time, murderers!"
"115740052-0-25515";"It worked? Well done! Let's hurry, Assassin."
"115740052-0-25516";"Initiate, let us speak."
"115740052-0-25517";"My dear Count, let's discuss the terms of this contract."
"115740052-0-25518";"Enough! I'll take care of you myself!"
"115740052-0-25519";"Join you? I'm going to send you to the Void, traitor!"
"115740052-0-25520";"Assassin, did you see that? That wasn't one of Lyra's shadows."
"115740052-0-25521";"Like something out of the old stories we scared the initiates with …."
"115740052-0-25522";"What lies did Artorius fill your head with, Lyra?"
"115740052-0-25526";"Try to find another path. If you hurry, maybe I'll let you help me make the kill."
"115740052-0-25527";"Stay close."
"115740052-0-25532";"No! What's happening?"
"115740052-0-25533";"The stories were true! Sithis, have mercy!"
"115740052-0-25536";"Every time you help me, someone winds up dead. Couldn't you let me deal with this myself?"
"115740052-0-25537";"Late again …. I erect the spine of deep disappointment."
"115740052-0-25538";"So, this is the Mad Hist. By the egg …. Do you see how it weeps and twists its roots? I hope the elders can help."
"115740052-0-25539";"No Order of the Hour? Hmm. Follow me, New-blade."
"115740052-0-25540";"Lyra? Hmm. Allow me to study the journal and its secrets will be revealed."
"115740052-0-25541";"We learned that the Black Dragon is the First Sword of the Order of the Hour. We recovered her journal and discovered her true name—Lyra."
"115740052-0-25542";"I can't think of anyone better for the task, Brother."
"115740052-0-25543";"I'll dig into the Black Dragon's journal immediately."
"115740052-0-25544";"<Werewolf howl.>"
"115740052-0-25545";"Hilde, wait! Hilde! Hildegard!"
"115740052-0-25546";"By all the ice in Eastmarch, she's fast when she's furry."
"115740052-0-25547";"Hildegard, which way did you …."
"115740052-0-25548";"That was … intense. I'm glad you showed up when you did."
"115740052-0-25549";"There you are, Kor! Did you need to stop and rest again?"
"115740052-0-25550";"I never rest when there's trouble around. We dealt with the big monster and now I'm taking a break."
"115740052-0-25551";"I think someone's in here …."
"115740052-0-25552";"Astara, Assassin! This way! Maybe we can get through that gate."
"115740052-0-25553";"How in Oblivion's bleakness did you get in here? No, don't tell me. I don't really want to know your trade secrets."
"115740052-0-25554";"Fetch my wine, girl. You know the one. And bring something … less expensive for my friend here."
"115740052-0-25555";"Is it locked, like the last one? I should have brought a pry bar."
"115740052-0-25556";"It's sealed up tight. We can't get through this way."
"115740052-0-25557";"Artorius really doesn't want any company, does he?"
"115740052-0-25558";"Wait. Someone's coming. We'll find you again, Assassin!"
"115740052-0-25559";"A touch of this, a pinch of that …."
"115740052-0-25560";"I miss sailing the open sea. Things were more clear out there. Kill or be killed. Take whatever you can carry. Fight to keep what's yours."
"115740052-0-25561";"It's the same here, I suppose. We're just less honest about it."
"115740052-0-25562";"Your wine, Governor."
"115740052-0-25563";"Mirabelle? Where's Edwina?"
"115740052-0-25564";"You know how clumsy Edwina can be, Governor. While she cleans up her mess, I brought your wine so you wouldn't be kept waiting."
"115740052-0-25565";"Initiative. I like that in a serving girl."
"115740052-0-25566";"The wine … what did you do?"
"115740052-0-25567";"We'll drink to your memory, Governor. And to the glory of the Night Mother."
"115740052-0-25568";"Mirabelle? She's one of … you?"
"115740052-0-25569";"Life is fleeting, Fortunata. An illusion. And in the end, everything belongs to Sithis. Tell him I said hello."
"115740052-0-25570";"First one of you Order fanatics that moves gets an arrow in the eye!"
"115740052-0-25571";"That's three times, Gurg! Let me see those dice!"
"115740052-0-25572";"I see I missed all the fun. Grazda, secure this chamber. Assassin, the Cathedral should be just up ahead."
"115740052-0-25573";"When you reach Artorius, I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-25574";"I could have handled those militant fools … but I appreciate the help."
"115740052-0-25575";"I won't die so easily, assassin scum!"
"115740052-0-25576";"Time to die, Artorius."
"115740052-0-25577";"Time? Time is my domain, murderer, not yours."
"115740052-0-25578";"You never complain until your dice run cold."
"115740052-0-25579";"Luck is like a guar pasture. You have to be careful where you step."
"115740052-0-25580";"Uh, yeah, what she said."
"115740052-0-25581";"Both of you shut your face holes and toss the bones."
"115740052-0-25585";"Next time, I'll wound more than just their pride! A moment, Qamar. I have a visitor."
"115740052-0-25586";"Ow! That smarts! I'll deal with the little ones. You take care of their mother!"
"115740052-0-25587";"Above us!"
"115740052-0-25588";"That one's trouble, Assassin. Prepare yourself for a real fight!"
"115740052-0-25589";"Another twenty, then, unless that's too rich for you?"
"115740052-0-25591";"Phew. That ladder was not kind to old knees. You have done well, Heem-Jas. Very well indeed."
"115740052-0-25602";"Mighty Hist, hear the cries of your children. Loosen your roots and unfetter your leaves. Sleep, dreamless and long. Sleep and be at peace."
"115740052-0-25608";"Quiet now. Good. With rest and clean water it may yet remember what it means to be a Hist. Thank you, friends."
"115740052-0-25609";"Yes! Victory for Heem Jas! Victory for the Su-Zahl—."
"115740052-0-25610";"Sorry. The cheering can wait … I guess."
"115740052-0-25611";"Who's there? She means to twist us into monsters! Please, you must set us free!"
"115740052-0-25612";"Indolent! Worthless! The Xit-Xaht do not suffer weakness. Drench the elders. Kill the invaders!"
"115740052-0-25613";"Ah, the Black Door. Still intact after all these years."
"115740052-0-25614";"No worries. I remember the proper reply."
"115740052-0-25615";"What is the gift of death?"
"115740052-0-25616";"Solace, my Brother."
"115740052-0-25617";"Welcome home."
"115740052-0-25618";"Spare me and I'll tell you where the werewolf is! We tracked her to the south!"
"115740052-0-25619";"I'm leaving! Please, don't hurt me! I'm never going to hunt anything again!"
"115740052-0-25620";"No! No!"
"115740052-0-25621";"You dare challenge the Order of the Silver Dawn? I'll tear your head off and mount it on my wall!"
"115740052-0-25622";"Hilde's not here. Let's ask around and see if any of the worshipers have seen her."
"115740052-0-25623";"I never was able to learn much about the purification. Even the Listener refused to talk about it."
"115740052-0-25624";"She did say that the Black Hand can call for purification in extreme circumstances. I just wish I knew what made the purge necessary."
"115740052-0-25625";"This time, though, I think we'll learn something I never knew. At least, I hope we will."
"115740052-0-25626";"Here we are. Keep your eyes open. The Sanctuary may be abandoned, but such places never stay quiet for long. Let us go inside."
"115740052-0-25633";"You're too close to this one, Mirabelle. Besides, the Speaker has already decided."
"115740052-0-25637";"Too close? They killed Cimbar, Astara! I'm going to be a part of this, whether you give the command or not."
"115740052-0-25638";"Dread Father, can you hear me? Do you see what they forced me to do?"
"115740052-0-25639";"Was this truly your will? Did Mother really command this? I did as I was told, but it still feels … wrong."
"115740052-0-25640";"Please, Dread Father. Talk to me! Were all these deaths truly what you wanted?"
"115740052-0-25641";"Allow me to assure you, child. You have done exactly as you were commanded."
"115740052-0-25642";"Speaker? I didn't know you were here."
"115740052-0-25643";"Another sacrament has been performed. You must go to the city of Kvatch and eliminate Jonas, the Primate of Akatosh."
"115740052-0-25644";"But Speaker … my family …. I need time to …."
"115740052-0-25645";"Your family? Such personal attachments are beneath you. Remember who you really are. Ruthless. Ambitious. You are my Silencer. My weapon."
"115740052-0-25646";"Yes, Speaker. I remember. I'll go to Kvatch immediately."
"115740052-0-25647";"Look, I was right. There is another memory to see."
"115740052-0-25648";"The Grand Sermonizer is at it again, Matron."
"115740052-0-25649";"Those loud-mouthed fanatics! It's time to teach them a lesson about the blessings of silence!"
"115740052-0-25650";"Enough! I'll decide how we respond to these malign sermons."
"115740052-0-25651";"Initiate, I have a task for you."
"115740052-0-25652";"Initiate, I have my own contract in Kvatch. I'll join you and Tanek as soon as I'm finished."
"115740052-0-25653";"Three blades on the same contract? Is that wise, Matron?"
"115740052-0-25654";"Just make sure the Grand Sermonizer dies, Initiate. That's my chief concern."
"115740052-0-25656";"Hey! Snowback! We're not done here!"
"115740052-0-25657";"Where you—you think … you're going?"
"115740052-0-25658";"I said you are like swamp gas—damp and smelly."
"115740052-0-25659";"You—you take that back!"
"115740052-0-25660";"Take a walk, milk-drinker."
"115740052-0-25661";"Pfft, you want—you want to go, tough … jerk … face?"
"115740052-0-25662";"You cling like a skin that will not shed!"
"115740052-0-25663";"I—I said good day! Good day!"
"115740052-0-25664";"Bah! To Sovngarde with you!"
"115740052-0-25665";"Take your best shot … ugly face!"
"115740052-0-25666";"I will hit you so hard your egg-brothers will cry!"
"115740052-0-25667";"I—I didn't want to do this!"
"115740052-0-25668";"Ha, well fought! Come, we will wash the blood from our mouths with drink!"
"115740052-0-25669";"Ugh—where am I? Must have taken a fall. I need another drink."
"115740052-0-25670";"Ah! I erect the spine of surrender!"
"115740052-0-25671";"I yield! I yield! Stop! I can't feel my face."
"115740052-0-25672";"This one knew your tail was yellow."
"115740052-0-25673";"Your blood on the streets then! It makes no difference to me!"
"115740052-0-25674";"That comment was unwise. Consider this a lesson."
"115740052-0-25675";"Filthy s'wit! You dare turn your back to me?"
"115740052-0-25676";"This one finds you dull in both wits and claws. Go bore another."
"115740052-0-25677";"I'll yank that weak spine out your arse and shove in a new one!"
"115740052-0-25678";"Is this your custom? Allow me to show you mine."
"115740052-0-25679";"How dare you even speak to me!"
"115740052-0-25680";"And now the hackles are raised. Good!"
"115740052-0-25681";"They'll have to mop you off the cobblestones!"
"115740052-0-25682";"You might not enjoy this, but I will."
"115740052-0-25683";"Beg, grovel, and weep!"
"115740052-0-25684";"Enough! I sheathe my claws and yield!"
"115740052-0-25685";"Tusk this! I give up. You win!"
"115740052-0-25686";"I … lost? Hmm. I must quit the drink."
"115740052-0-25687";"Keep your filthy hands off of me! Enough! I surrender!"
"115740052-0-25688";"I'll see you back at the Sanctuary, darling. After I clean up any evidence of our involvement."
"115740052-0-25689";"That thing's awfully large … and it looks kind of dangerous."
"115740052-0-25690";"Don't be such a jittery mudcrab. For a troll, he's quite docile. And that iron is practically unbreakable."
"115740052-0-25691";"If you say so. He still looks angry to me. What are you doing with it, by the way?"
"115740052-0-25692";"Someone's looking to buy the largest, meanest troll I could find. If the gold's good, I don't ask questions."
"115740052-0-25693";"Largest, meanest troll you could find? I thought you said it wasn't dangerous?"
"115740052-0-25694";"Psst! Assassin! Up here! I'm waiting for the Black Dragon."
"115740052-0-25695";"I'll see Cimbar and the Dread Father soon … but you need to warn Astara … the Black Dragon is …."
"115740052-0-25698";"How did you get in here? Akatosh, protect me!"
"115740052-0-25699";"<There is a knocking on the door.>"

"115740052-0-25705";"Muck-dwellers! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-25706";"No. No, I think not. Xal-Nur prepares your elders for sacrifice even as we speak. Their blood will water the roots. As will yours."
"115740052-0-25707";"A sacrifice? There may still be time to save them. If the stories are true, Xal-Nur is slow and stupid … but also strong as a graht oak. We must move quickly."

"115740052-0-25711";"Now back to the Sanctuary, my assassins. We have friends to remember and a victory to celebrate."
"115740052-0-25712";"Up, muck-mouth! Now!"

"115740052-0-25721";"Step forward, my Silencer!"

"115740052-0-25736";"Thank you, root-mother, but my companions are the real heroes. I spent most of our adventure lost or unconscious. I was …."
"115740052-0-25737";"You there! Wait for a moment, if you would!"
"115740052-0-25738";"I'm unarmed. May we speak before you kill me?"
"115740052-0-25739";"Green-Venom-Tongue challenged me and failed. What hope do you have? Even my shadows are more substantial than you!"
"115740052-0-25740";"Reckless? Yes. But the chick that tumbles out of the nest is not without virtue. Courage—even a fool's courage—is always worthy of praise."

"115740052-0-25744";"My, someone is certainly curious about this Nord girl. I wonder who she could be?"
"115740052-0-25745";"So the New-blade brought down the Black Dragon? And I didn't expect you'd survive your first contract!"
"115740052-0-25746";"All our Brothers and Sisters murdered. But we're safe now, right? The Black Dragon's dead."
"115740052-0-25747";"The Assassin ended the threat of the Black Dragon, but we won't be safe until Artorius joins her in the Void."
"115740052-0-25748";"But the Primate speaks for Akatosh! Isn't that blasphemy?"
"115740052-0-25749";"It can't be blasphemy if we don't adhere to that religion, Hilde."
"115740052-0-25750";"I want to plunge my dagger into him, once for every Brother and Sister he's killed."
"115740052-0-25751";"Artorius will die. You have my word on that. And you'll each have a hand in the slaying. Now move. We have preparations to make."
"115740052-0-25752";"Don't you dare follow me! I've got some apples and I know how to use them!"
"115740052-0-25753";"Didn't I tell you to leave me alone? My commander isn't going to like this!"
"115740052-0-25754";"I don't think this is what Raz meant when he said ""be discreet."""
"115740052-0-25755";"I found the Sweetroll Killer, Commander! Help!"
"115740052-0-25756";"Raz forgot how much he hates working out in the open like this."
"115740052-0-25757";"Very well, then. A toast! To taking what you can and fighting to keep what's yours."
"115740052-0-25758";"Raz saw one of the suspicious messengers near the hedge maze to the southwest. Why the city has a hedge maze is a mystery for another day, yes?"
"115740052-0-25759";"Pardon me. Excuse me. Coming through."
"115740052-0-25760";"What a wonderful place to hide something! Look for a statue or something. Anything that could serve as a marker for a hiding place."
"115740052-0-25762";"A coded message? Raz hates riddles. You figure it out, yes?"
"115740052-0-25763";"You really shouldn't break into a house that someone has already broken into. Where's your sense of honor, Razum-dar?"
"115740052-0-25764";"Ah, of course! The Beautiful Darkness! Wait, is Naryu the Sweetroll Killer? Raz would be sad to have to kill you now."
"115740052-0-25765";"Well, I am a killer, but I'm not the killer. And what's that one doing here? This has nothing to do with the Brotherhood …."
"115740052-0-25766";"Of course I know where you went, Venom. If I didn't intend for that to happen, you'd be a backpack by now. Tell me what you uncovered."
"115740052-0-25767";"All evidence points to one conclusion—Lyra is the Black Dragon. And she's working for Primate Artorius."
"115740052-0-25768";"The Black Dragon was one of us. She knows how we think, how we act. Artorius uses our own weapon against us!"
"115740052-0-25769";"Give me the order, Matron."
"115740052-0-25770";"Let my blade be the one that ends the Black Dragon's life."
"115740052-0-25771";"Patience, Brother. Let me consider the ramifications. Your connection to Lyra could be a boon in this matter, but it could also be a detriment."
"115740052-0-25772";"Ah, here comes our Assassin. Back from the wilds of Black Marsh, I see. Come. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-25773";"Um, Raz is confused. You better talk to Naryu so we can figure out what's going on here."
"115740052-0-25774";"If you stare at that statue any harder, Raz, your eyes will pop right out of your head."
"115740052-0-25775";"Raz is just admiring the beautiful mermaid. It is so … large. And shapely!"
"115740052-0-25778";"No! You die! You …."

"115740052-0-25782";"You think it's going to be that easy? We've got you surrounded!"
"115740052-0-25783";"Tell Raz what's wrong with these people right now, yes?"
"115740052-0-25784";"All in good time. First, let's discuss what the fates have in store for us. It's sure to be illuminating."
"115740052-0-25785";"Is the cat always like this?"
"115740052-0-25786";"Actually, this is one of Raz's good days …."
"115740052-0-25787";"I'm sure your apprentice just ran off. Probably better she's gone when the killer comes around, anyway."
"115740052-0-25788";"Yarmia never flees at the first sign of trouble. Second, yes, but first? Plus she always comes back. Raz has a bad feeling …."
"115740052-0-25789";"We all have bad feelings. It's inevitable. I'll have my eyes and ears around town watch for her, if it makes you feel any better."
"115740052-0-25790";"Raz appreciates that. And people say you're a stone-cold harlot. But not Raz."
"115740052-0-25792";"Put away your weapon, child. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-25793";"You feel lost, without purpose. But the opposite is true. Everything has led you to me."
"115740052-0-25794";"Oh really? I just see another witness that needs to be silenced."
"115740052-0-25795";"I performed the Sacrament that brought you here. Not because Primate Jonas needed to die, but because the Dragon God wanted us to join forces."
"115740052-0-25796";"Join forces? I don't understand …."
"115740052-0-25797";"You need to turn away from the Void and step into the light. Join me and together we'll walk the path to redemption."
"115740052-0-25798";"Redemption? I'm a murderer! There's no redemption for someone like me."
"115740052-0-25799";"Nonsense, child. Akatosh performs more impressive miracles than that all the time. We just need to turn your talents to the holy work of the Dragon God."
"115740052-0-25800";"Become my champion, a sword of Akatosh—my Black Dragon that burns away evil's darkness."
"115740052-0-25801";"I … yes. I see it now. I pledge my blade and my life to you and to Akatosh. Show me the way."
"115740052-0-25802";"Let's return to the Sanctuary and tell Astara what the fumes revealed. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-25803";"Raz thinks this place is too quiet. Good spot for an ambush, yes?"
"115740052-0-25804";"Oh, I certainly hope so! I could use a good fight right about now."
"115740052-0-25805";"You send very mixed messages, Naryu. One moment you're flirting, the next you're stabbing. It's very confusing."
"115740052-0-25806";"That's only because you assume the two are different, Razum dear."
"115740052-0-25807";"The threads of fate align! Kill them now!"
"115740052-0-25808";"Oh, good. Raz has found them."
"115740052-0-25809";"Enough! Too much blood has been spilled."
"115740052-0-25810";"You've won. I know that. So sheathe your weapons and come inside."
"115740052-0-25811";"I'll honor my word and show Razum-dar where to find the antidote."
"115740052-0-25812";"And Raz will let you leave this land. But next time Raz thinks, not so much."
"115740052-0-25813";"I can't believe you people! How can you let a killer just walk away free and clear?"
"115740052-0-25814";"Raz cannot let innocents die. Is your heart really that cold, Naryu?"
"115740052-0-25815";"Don't worry, assassin. We'll meet again."
"115740052-0-25816";"Let's meet back at the enchanter's shop when this sorry affair is done."
"115740052-0-25817";"I thought you'd support me in this. Shows how much of the future I can see."
"115740052-0-25818";"No! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-25819";"It had to be done, Raz. We let her leave and she just becomes somebody else's problem."
"115740052-0-25820";"This is not how an Eye of the Queen does things. This is more like the Brotherhood. Or the Morag Tong."
"115740052-0-25821";"Get over yourself, cat. We saved lives today. Including mine."
"115740052-0-25822";"I'll be at the inn in Kvatch for a while longer. Come and see me before I leave, when you get a chance."
"115740052-0-25823";"Move it, short apprentice. And do not forget Raz's favorite brush. It would be a tragedy if this beautiful fur got tangles."
"115740052-0-25824";"This is definitely not what I signed up for."
"115740052-0-25825";"When I get up you will be … ugh!"
"115740052-0-25826";"The Fate-Bearers will deal with the destinies of others. Your charges are safe, for now."
"115740052-0-25827";"We're just going to let a killer walk away? Are you serious?"
"115740052-0-25828";"If it buys these people time, it is for the best. Remember, this helps you as well, Naryu."
"115740052-0-25829";"Good people of Anvil—prepare to be amazed, astounded, and above all, entertained! The Naughty Nereid Players have arrived!"
"115740052-0-25830";"If the killer is dead, everyone benefits. We don't even know if we can trust her!"
"115740052-0-25831";"Raz will watch and make sure she leaves the Gold Coast. Then we can meet at the enchanter's shop, yes?"
"115740052-0-25832";"Gaze in wonder at our fire-tamer! From the blistering summit of Ash Mountain, I bring you the volcano's favorite son, Torrid Torolon!"
"115740052-0-25833";"Well, that's one way to handle the situation."
"115740052-0-25834";"What? Torolon's mastery of the flame doesn't impress and astound you? Perhaps you want something … truly hot!"
"115740052-0-25835";"It's better this way. She can't hurt anyone if she's dead."
"115740052-0-25836";"But what about her Fate-Bearers? Raz fears this might just be the beginning."
"115740052-0-25837";"We'll manage. One less of … whatever they call themselves, is one less we have to deal with later."
"115740052-0-25838";"I need a drink. Join me at the Kvatch inn and we'll say a proper goodbye."

"115740052-0-25878";"Honestly, Lepida, I don't know if I can take much more of Gavro's mischief. You know I found a crate full of bones, a shriveled up heart, and a knife under his bed?"
"115740052-0-25879";"Eight's mercy, what's he doing with all that?"
"115740052-0-25880";"Wouldn't say. Just told me I'd ""find out soon enough,"" and scampered out like a dock-tailed skeever. Kids, am I right?"
"115740052-0-25881";"That tremor you feel isn't anticipation! Give a cheer for the one, the only—Legate Turrianus!"
"115740052-0-25882";"It's feeding time!"
"115740052-0-25883";"This master beast trainer's pack of vicious dunerippers look hungry today!"
"115740052-0-25884";"Sibylla! We're running a bank, not a Baandari swap meet. These cobblestones look like they were dragged through a sick troll's dung!"
"115740052-0-25885";"What a feeding frenzy! Look at the blood fly!"
"115740052-0-25886";"Uh oh! That roar isn't the crowd, challengers!"
"115740052-0-25887";"Rest in peace, rippers, Legate Tirrianus bit the dust! Make some noise for our new champions!"
"115740052-0-25888";"Ouch! There's more than sand getting sundered in the arena tonight! Another savage victory for Legate Tirrianus!"

"115740052-0-25890";"Ah ah ah! The only P-word we use here is ""privateer."" And also ""profit."" And occasionally ""paid off."" But never pirate! Now find a way to clean this walkway or find yourself another job!"
"115740052-0-25891";"Ah, the great oaf stirs. Busy day at the Fighters Guild Hall, eh?"
"115740052-0-25892";"Bah! You mages fare no better. It's that damned Pirate Queen and her boot-licking Red Sails. Can't sharpen a sword without those rat-faced corsairs kicking down your door."
"115740052-0-25893";"True enough. I've got half a mind to sail back to Wayrest. Better to be taxed by a High-King than to be fleeced by a wharf-rat in royal clothing."
"115740052-0-25894";"Have you heard? Fortunata's dead!"
"115740052-0-25895";"Aye. Nestrana says they're still scraping her off the rocks. Shor's bones, I'd trade all the mead in Skyrim to see her face as she fell."
"115740052-0-25896";"Ah, Skaldeif, brutish as always …. Oh who am I kidding? Oblivion take that sour wench!"
"115740052-0-25897";"Have you heard who's fighting in the arena today? I hear it's going to be a bloodbath!"
"115740052-0-25898";"Hrmph. Crude amusements for fools and traitors. You'd do well to spend more time in the Cathedral."
"115740052-0-25899";"And you'd do well to loosen that codpiece. By the Eight, what a killjoy!"
"115740052-0-25901";"Hail, Laurina. You know, I was thinking …."
"115740052-0-25902";"No, I am not going to stone-shape the mermaid's hair out of the way."
"115740052-0-25903";"Oh come on! You're not curious about whether she's—"
"115740052-0-25904";"Not even remotely."
"115740052-0-25905";"Bah. To Sovngarde with you! Elf-blooded prude."
"115740052-0-25907";"We've brought out the worst of the worst to come pay their penance in the pit!"
"115740052-0-25908";"Are you hungry for blood? The Kvatch Arena's next event is about to begin!"
"115740052-0-25909";"Mercy only applies to the victors! Fight for your miserable lives!"
"115740052-0-25910";"Let the games begin!"
"115740052-0-25911";"Victory! Three cheers for the survivors! They get to live another day!"
"115740052-0-25912";"What bloodshed! Thieves and murderers certainly know how it's done!"
"115740052-0-25913";"Pardons well earned! Let's clean them up and make them presentable for freedom!"
"115740052-0-25914";"You said one of the pirates saw a werewolf? What's such a beast doing down here?"
"115740052-0-25915";"Quiet! I thought I heard something."
"115740052-0-25916";"Assassins in the catacombs? Show me!"
"115740052-0-25917";"It is done."
"115740052-0-25918";"Tanek, have you seen Mirabelle?"
"115740052-0-25919";"Sorry, I don't help puppies track their masters."
"115740052-0-25920";"Puppy? How many throats have we cut, side-by-side? You could at least refer to me as a dire wolf."
"115740052-0-25921";"If it makes you feel any better, I wouldn't help Hildegard find Kor, either."
"115740052-0-25922";"It does, actually."
"115740052-0-25923";"My Sister! There you are—I haven't seen you in hours."
"115740052-0-25924";"Yes, yes. Do you have a spare rag? Something I can burn when I'm done."
"115740052-0-25925";"A rag? Not even a ""Hello Brother, how are you? Might I shower you with kisses?"""
"115740052-0-25926";"Before I wipe the poisoned wax from my lips? If you insist …."
"115740052-0-25927";"Didn't realize you just finished a contract. Here. Use my handkerchief."
"115740052-0-25928";"When the Initiate killed Jarol, the hope for stability in the Gold Coast died with him."
"115740052-0-25929";"So … that's a good thing?"
"115740052-0-25930";"Of course. With Anvil and Kvatch at odds, our Sanctuary will find much holy work."
"115740052-0-25931";"You're saying we have the Initiate to thank for our future?"
"115740052-0-25932";"We have Sithis to thank. The Initiate was but his instrument."
"115740052-0-25933";"I'll miss Durisa's overconfidence. But Van … he was barely here. Where was he from?"
"115740052-0-25934";"Bruma, I think?"
"115740052-0-25935";"According to my notes, Van was from Glenumbra. He lived in Bruma for a few years prior to the Alliance War."
"115740052-0-25936";"You recorded all that about a Brother we knew for less than a month?"
"115740052-0-25938";"You didn't?"
"115740052-0-25939";"You aren't normally so listless. I don't like it."
"115740052-0-25940";"I pushed Cimbar to take the Grand Sermonizer contract. I feel partly responsible for what happened."
"115740052-0-25941";"I wasn't inviting you to share. But you're right. If anyone is to blame for his death, it's you."
"115740052-0-25942";"What?"
"115740052-0-25943";"You wanted to see the limits of his affection. Now you know. He died for you, and you get to live with that."
"115740052-0-25944";"Those maggots of Akatosh have displayed Cimbar's body in Kvatch! Astara won't let me do a thing about it."
"115740052-0-25945";"But … you follow the Night Mother's teachings."
"115740052-0-25946";"What of it?"
"115740052-0-25947";"Cimbar's soul is with Sithis. His corpse is just bones and rotting meat."
"115740052-0-25948";"Of course it is! But to mock what he did in the Night Mother's name? That's the true desecration."
"115740052-0-25949";"What are you writing?"
"115740052-0-25950";"Tallying the stupid questions you've asked today. Eight, if you were wondering."
"115740052-0-25951";"Why do I even bother?"
"115740052-0-25952";"That makes nine."
"115740052-0-25953";"Void take you, Brother."
"115740052-0-25954";"My accommodations are unacceptable. I had my own chambers in the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-25955";"If you feel so strongly about it, we can mail you back there. In pieces."
"115740052-0-25956";"It's just the way she is. Don't let her get to you."
"115740052-0-25957";"I didn't ask your opinion, dog handler."
"115740052-0-25958";"Wonderful. As though they're related."
"115740052-0-25959";"You're pacing. What don't you want to tell me?"
"115740052-0-25960";"Hildegard isn't taking this well. First Durisa and Van, now Cimbar … Tanek, barely holding on."
"115740052-0-25961";"If you're saying you can't control Hildegard, I'll put her down myself."
"115740052-0-25962";"She's still a child, Astara."
"115740052-0-25963";"No. She's a vicious killer who wears a child's form when it suits her. Never forget that."
"115740052-0-25964";"The chanters mourn the Grand Sermonizer. Her death struck the fear of the Void in their hearts."
"115740052-0-25965";"Tanek mentioned a ""Black Dragon"" was involved. Do we know who that is?"
"115740052-0-25966";"None in the Sanctuary have heard that name. I'll ask around, quietly."
"115740052-0-25967";"I want the Sermonizer's fingerbone. When I find the Black Dragon, I will drive it through her eye."
"115740052-0-25968";"I'll disinter her and recover it. The damage I do to the corpse will leave its own message."
"115740052-0-25969";"Do you recall the taste of their torn and bloody throats? Is their last breath what you exhale into them?"
"115740052-0-25970";"Mirabelle! Stop teasing Hildegard!"
"115740052-0-25971";"Would you prefer I tease you, oh large and boisterous one?"
"115740052-0-25972";"I can stand up for myself. You know that, right?"
"115740052-0-25973";"Oh, this is just too cute for me to stand. Now I need to kill someone. Elam, give me a contract!"
"115740052-0-25974";"I wonder, why did they torture Cimbar before they killed him?"
"115740052-0-25975";"Is this really a conversation you assume I want to be having?"
"115740052-0-25976";"Someone has to ask the tough questions."
"115740052-0-25977";"Don't you have murder to commit somewhere? Preferrably in Orsinium?"
"115740052-0-25978";"As a matter of fact, I was just going to sharpen my favorite daggers before I packed them."
"115740052-0-25979";"It's good to see you upright. I never realized how weak you looked lying in a cot."
"115740052-0-25980";"I thought you preferred me horizontal."
"115740052-0-25981";"And I thought you avoided entanglements with anyone you called ""Sister."""
"115740052-0-25982";"There's always Kor. From everything I hear, Nords aren't that selective."
"115740052-0-25983";"If I wanted a hairy idiot warming my bed, I'd toss it into Hildegard's cell."
"115740052-0-25984";"You don't need to make such a show of missing Cimbar."
"115740052-0-25985";"Explain yourself, Brother."
"115740052-0-25986";"What? He had his fantasy and you had a pet you lured away from Durisa."
"115740052-0-25987";"You shall never speak of Cimbar again."
"115740052-0-25988";"Oh, I see! You're practicing feigned outrage? I'll leave you to it."
"115740052-0-25989";"Don't blame yourself about the Silver Dawn. I'm proud of you, Hilde. You were trying to protect the family."
"115740052-0-25990";"Thank you, but … I endangered you, the Initiate, and myself. That horrible chanter lead me astray and I let him."
"115740052-0-25991";"True. But you can't learn from mistakes until you make them."
"115740052-0-25992";"A lesson Chanter Nemus will never learn."
"115740052-0-25993";"For what the Initiate told me, the chanter learned his lesson. Briefly."
"115740052-0-25994";"The Initiate's killing of Chanter Nemus has the rest of the chanters out in force."
"115740052-0-25995";"Because it happened in the Chapel of Dibella? Interesting, I'll make a note of their fear."
"115740052-0-25996";"They aren't afraid, they're angry. They're openly calling for the destruction of the Dark Brotherhood."
"115740052-0-25997";"Truly? Have you told Astara?"
"115740052-0-25998";"As soon as I heard. I fear we've awakened a sleeping giant. May Sithis blind its eyes."
"115740052-0-25999";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-26000";"I could ask the same question of you."
"115740052-0-26001";"And I could assume you're an intruder, stick a dagger through your ribs, and feed your corpse to Hildegard."
"115740052-0-26002";"You can barely stand, you fetcher."
"115740052-0-26003";"I do prefer a challenge. Wait, where are you going? Don't make me hobble after you!"
"115740052-0-26004";"Do you remember the first contract we took together? That High Elf matron from Summerset?"
"115740052-0-26005";"I remember you putting poison in five different dinner glasses because you didn't know which one was hers."
"115740052-0-26006";"And then she called for a toast! What was it she said?"
"115740052-0-26007";"""To our health and family, may they last for countless generations."""
"115740052-0-26008";"The look on their faces before they all dropped? It really took the sting away from splitting our cut."
"115740052-0-26009";"Why are you staring at me?"
"115740052-0-26010";"You should wear nicer clothes."
"115740052-0-26011";"But … I don't want to."
"115740052-0-26012";"How you present yourself is important. Best to appear harmless without and disguise the killer within."
"115740052-0-26013";"Tell me something I don't know."
"115740052-0-26014";"Black Dragon. What fool names herself after a mythical creature?"
"115740052-0-26015";"Dragons aren't myth. They're real."
"115740052-0-26016";"Maybe once, but they're all dead now."
"115740052-0-26017";"One day they'll return and burn the world to cinder."
"115740052-0-26018";"I understand. You name yourself the Black Dragon to frighten superstitious fools. Thanks, Hilde."
"115740052-0-26019";"I don't want to hear another word about this."
"115740052-0-26020";"You think I can't avenge a fallen Brother?"
"115740052-0-26021";"Enough."
"115740052-0-26022";"I deserve to be sent after the Black Dragon. This isn't the last you'll hear of it!"
"115740052-0-26023";"Of course it isn't."
"115740052-0-26024";"The Red Sails have lost their bluster. Without the Pirate Queen to lead them, they've begun to scatter."
"115740052-0-26025";"What does that mean?"
"115740052-0-26026";"Sithis provides an opportunity. Some contracts may be easier to complete if we disguise ourselves as Red Sails."
"115740052-0-26027";"That's … should we do that?"
"115740052-0-26028";"We should do what we must to honor the Night Mother. Never forget this, Hilde."
"115740052-0-26029";"Your book. It contains secret knowledge, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-26030";"Why do you ask?"
"115740052-0-26031";"Kor says I've bitten him when I'm a wolf. Is that … do you know if that's true?"
"115740052-0-26032";"I … no, I don't know that. But I could tell you how many people you've eaten since we took you in."
"115740052-0-26033";"Forget I asked."
"115740052-0-26034";"Why don't you speak about your old Sanctuary?"
"115740052-0-26035";"The one the Black Hand purified? I don't know, Brother. Why don't I speak of it?"
"115740052-0-26036";"But if you could, wouldn't you want to prevent that from happening again?"
"115740052-0-26037";"I've noted your complete lack of understanding in my book."
"115740052-0-26038";"You spend too much time with Tanek."
"115740052-0-26039";"Did you know Kor has begun to follow you?"
"115740052-0-26040";"What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-26041";"Ever since that chanter died in Anvil, you gained a shadow."
"115740052-0-26042";"That's simply not true!"
"115740052-0-26043";"What's not true?"
"115740052-0-26044";"You should try harder to fit in. You don't need to be friendly, but we need to know you fight at our backs."
"115740052-0-26045";"Even if I wanted to do so, why would I bother?"
"115740052-0-26046";"What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-26047";"By the time I do, the Black Dragon will have killed most of you."
"115740052-0-26048";"There's no helping some people."
"115740052-0-26049";"I won't have another Brother or Sister fall to the Black Dragon. Be ever vigilant on your contracts."
"115740052-0-26050";"I didn't think she cared."
"115740052-0-26051";"She doesn't. She means that the Sanctuary's profits dip if there are less of us around."
"115740052-0-26052";"It was sarcasm. You should spend more time around Tanek."
"115740052-0-26053";"I'll make note of your failed attempt at sarcasm."
"115740052-0-26054";"I'm still trying to understand the Order of the Hour's connection to the chanters."
"115740052-0-26055";"They both worship Akatosh. Isn't that enough?"
"115740052-0-26056";"Many people erroneously follow the Eight. That doesn't mean they act in unison."
"115740052-0-26057";"I wonder how the Order feels about the Assassin rampaging through their home."
"115740052-0-26058";"If the job was done right? Hopefully nothing at all."
"115740052-0-26059";"Let me just finish recording the details of my latest contract … there!"
"115740052-0-26060";"You write down how you kill people?"
"115740052-0-26061";"Among other things. It's good to keep track of the many ways to honor Sithis and the Night Mother."
"115740052-0-26062";"I bet that's not all there is in that book. Anything good about Mirabelle or Hildegard? Maybe the Matron?"
"115740052-0-26063";"Have you … have you been reading my book, Tanek?"
"115740052-0-26064";"Mirabelle. That's another death we owe the Black Dragon."
"115740052-0-26065";"Let's just hope it's the last."
"115740052-0-26066";"Enough of this! Let's talk about something fun. Did I tell you about the time I spent the night with three wyrd sisters?"
"115740052-0-26067";"The ones you fed to the crocodiles?"
"115740052-0-26068";"No, that was the other time. I was talking about the time I set their hut on fire before I took my leave."
"115740052-0-26069";"Would you ever purify this Sanctuary?"
"115740052-0-26070";"If the Black Hand ordered it, I'd slit the throats of everyone here."
"115740052-0-26071";"That sounds oddly specific. Have you thought about who you would kill first?"
"115740052-0-26072";"Astara? Why are you staring at me?"
"115740052-0-26073";"I … I see. I'll just make a note of that …."
"115740052-0-26074";"You don't seem like you belong here. You're too much like a field mouse."
"115740052-0-26075";"Do you think you can speak to me the way Mirabelle did? She was family."
"115740052-0-26076";"Then what am I, exactly?"
"115740052-0-26077";"Extended family."
"115740052-0-26078";"I don't know why I bother trying."
"115740052-0-26079";"I don't see why Sanctuaries get purified. It seems so wasteful."
"115740052-0-26080";"Because it's safer to remove a gangrenous tail than to let the wound fester."
"115740052-0-26081";"But a Sanctuary isn't an Argonian tail. It won't grow back."
"115740052-0-26082";"That's why I'm recording everything. In case I need to treat a wounded Sanctuary."
"115740052-0-26083";"We speak the same tongue, yet it always sounds like a different language."
"115740052-0-26084";"No further word about the Black Dragon."
"115740052-0-26085";"And the chanters? The sermonizers?"
"115740052-0-26086";"All any of them talk about these days is the Dark Brotherhood."
"115740052-0-26087";"Cut one chanter's throat, and another two spring up to take their place."
"115740052-0-26088";"Don't worry. They'll eventually run out of throats."
"115740052-0-26089";"You don't talk much about life before the Dark Brotherhood. What led you here?"
"115740052-0-26090";"Many choices I'm not exactly proud of."
"115740052-0-26091";"But you're proud of all … this? What is so different?"
"115740052-0-26092";"Here, I kill for gold. For a higher purpose. For my family. Not because I feel I must."
"115740052-0-26093";"I can understand that."
"115740052-0-26094";"Astara says I can accept contracts again, but I don't think I'm fully recovered. My bladework feels sloppy."
"115740052-0-26095";"What do you miss the most?"
"115740052-0-26096";"The target, by a thumb's width."
"115740052-0-26097";"No. I meant, what do you miss the most about taking contracts?"
"115740052-0-26098";"Throwing daggers … at targets. With the right twist of the wrist, you can drive them directly into the brain."
"115740052-0-26099";"Were you humming?"
"115740052-0-26100";"I was doing nothing of the sort."
"115740052-0-26101";"A shame—it was lovely."
"115740052-0-26102";"I don't know what you mean."
"115740052-0-26103";"Of course, Matron."
"115740052-0-26104";"Some fool just walked into Anvil, stabbed the first person he saw, and demanded he be allowed to join us."
"115740052-0-26105";"What's the matter with that? We need new recruits."
"115740052-0-26106";"He stabbed Grazda."
"115740052-0-26107";"Ha! That was his last mistake."
"115740052-0-26108";"You're always going on about an opportunity for vivisection, aren't you? Go, find her. I told her to wait."
"115740052-0-26109";"I'm all right, Kor. It's just … everyone around us is dying."
"115740052-0-26110";"We're the Dark Brotherhood. It's what we do."
"115740052-0-26111";"Green-Venom-Tongue's endess questions. Mirabelle's wicked sense of humor. I miss them all."
"115740052-0-26112";"Even Brema?"
"115740052-0-26113";"No. She should have bitten out her own tongue before she betrayed our family. Void take her."
"115740052-0-26114";"We'll have plenty of warning before the Order of the Hour moves against us."
"115740052-0-26115";"You're so certain?"
"115740052-0-26116";"The Black Dragon was like a talon trying to pluck out our eyes."
"115740052-0-26117";"And the Order is what, a drunk echatere with bells tied to its crest?"
"115740052-0-26118";"That's an odd way to put it. But yes, that's an apt description."
"115740052-0-26119";"Why back to Skyrim? What brought this on?"
"115740052-0-26120";"Just for a few weeks."
"115740052-0-26121";"Matron willing, I'll join you. But why?"
"115740052-0-26122";"I want to hunt like I am now. Not by instinct. I want everyone to know I am a part of this family."
"115740052-0-26123";"Of course, Hilde. We'll take the contract together."
"115740052-0-26124";"Matron? You never said anything about my leaving. The time I went to Skyrim."
"115740052-0-26125";"You're correct. I didn't."
"115740052-0-26126";"Why not?"
"115740052-0-26127";"If I'd ordered your death, I would have ordered Kor's as well. But I couldn't allow our numbers to fall that low."
"115740052-0-26128";"Oh. That … makes sense, I suppose …."
"115740052-0-26129";"I think Hildegard may be ready for more … complex contracts."
"115740052-0-26130";"She can control when she changes?"
"115740052-0-26131";"No, but I believe she and the wolf inside her have reached an understanding."
"115740052-0-26132";"I'll think about it."
"115740052-0-26133";"Good. I'll look for contracts that require the body to disappear completely."
"115740052-0-26134";"I had some questions. Kor said I should ask you directly."
"115740052-0-26135";"No, I don't shed, nor do I chase tossed bones. Yes, I mark my territory. No, I don't know why."
"115740052-0-26136";"I wanted to know how your hair stays braided when you transform back. You mark your territory?"
"115740052-0-26137";"No! No, I was joking. It was a joke."
"115740052-0-26138";"Of course it was. Just stay away from my things if you feel the beast coming on, eh?"
"115740052-0-26139";"I heard there was some trouble at the Sanctuary. What did I miss?"
"115740052-0-26140";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-26141";"Amelie Crowe."
"115740052-0-26142";"Are you new here?"
"115740052-0-26143";"I was around since … you know, never mind."
"115740052-0-26144";"That was a battle for the ages! And I never got to kill someone in a Cathedral before."
"115740052-0-26145";"For all the harm he caused us, I feel a little sorry for Primate Artorius."
"115740052-0-26146";"How could you feel sorry about that barnacle on a mudcrab after all he did to us?"
"115740052-0-26147";"I feel sorry because he only got to die once. We should have killed him at least four times for what he did."
"115740052-0-26148";"I'm not sure you're really understanding the concept of empathy on this one, Kor."
"115740052-0-26149";"Not all at once …. Really, you're too kind."
"115740052-0-26151";"The Black Dragon will make you pay for striking a servant of Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-26152";"The Order of the Hour wins again! We'll give the challengers a moment to lick their wounds before we let them try again."
"115740052-0-26153";"When Knight Commander Panthius delivers a beating, he does it with style! Will the challengers try again? We'll know in a moment!"
"115740052-0-26154";"Ignaria Denian incinerated our challengers! Do they need a moment to cool off or are they well and truly burned?"
"115740052-0-26155";"Magos Polus turned a snowball into an avalanche! Will the challengers try again or call it quits?"
"115740052-0-26156";"Has Legate Turrianus shaken the challengers beyond any hope of victory? Let them gather their wits and we'll find out!"
"115740052-0-26157";"You murderous dogs! The Gold Coast will be a better place when you're all dead!"
"115740052-0-26158";"Raz is a genius! Raz has figured out what the clues mean!"
"115740052-0-26159";"<Enraged bellow>"
"115740052-0-26160";"Tsono-Xuhil! Mother root, father stone—grant me your strength!"
"115740052-0-26161";"No! You will feed the roots! You will …."
"115740052-0-26162";"Dry-skinned savages. This city will be your grave!"
"115740052-0-26163";"Sweet Mother, Sweet Mother …"
"115740052-0-26164";"Send your child unto me …"
"115740052-0-26165";"For the sins of the unworthy …"
"115740052-0-26166";"Must be baptized in blood and fear."
"115740052-0-26167";"This is the Black Sacrament, Initiate."
"115740052-0-26168";"A contract that calls for murder."
"115740052-0-26169";"So welcome, Initiate."
"115740052-0-26170";"To the Dark Brotherhood."
"115740052-0-26171";"Welcome, assassin, to our deadly trade."
"115740052-0-26172";"For in Tamriel, no one is safe."
"115740052-0-26173";"Especially from us."
"115740052-0-26174";"Sweet Mother, Sweet Mother, send your child unto me …"
"115740052-0-26175";"Welcome, Initiate."
"115740052-0-26176";"Know this:"
"115740052-0-26177";"In Tamriel, no one is safe."
"115740052-0-26178";"Especially from us."
"115740052-0-26179";"Sweet Mother, Sweet Mother, send your child unto me …"
"115740052-0-26180";"Assassin, the Order's created an army! Do whatever you can to disrupt their preparations, starting with those siege engines!"
"115740052-0-26181";"Beasts in amber! Wake and remember!"
"115740052-0-26182";"Rise, amber shade of Xal-Nur! Crush them!"
"115740052-0-26183";"Gah! Enough! Wake, vines, and drag them to Sithis!"
"115740052-0-26184";"Assassin, over here!"
"115740052-0-26185";"Hmm. Looks like we're all alone."
"115740052-0-26186";"Shazara-Ta will return you to the Gold Coast. I'll meet you in front of Akatosh's Cathedral in Kvatch … after I pay my respects to these … memories."
"115740052-0-26187";"Lyra? Ah, a shadow! Clever. Very clever."
"115740052-0-26188";"I can't do that, Lyra. You brought this on yourself."
"115740052-0-26189";"The Order of the Hour will purify your Sanctuary. You cannot stop it."
"115740052-0-26190";"The Black Dragon's using shadows to track our progress."
"115740052-0-26191";"You are a blight before Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-26192";"Let the Dragon God guide my hand!"
"115740052-0-26193";"Send more of your lackeys, Primate! It's a pleasure to cut them down!"
"115740052-0-26194";"Brethren, be wary. They're coming in from the sides!"
"115740052-0-26195";"And so, the assassins finally arrive."
"115740052-0-26196";"His heart shines with the color of night. His song sings with the music of life. His gaze inspires fear and his hands grant the gift of death."
"115740052-0-26197";"The Dread Father acts through him. And his work has just begun."
"115740052-0-26198";"Hail Sithis!"
"115740052-0-26199";"Hmm. Interesting. It seems that gate blocks our way."
"115740052-0-26200";"One moment. I think I can get through that break in the bars."
"115740052-0-26201";"Let's see if this switch opens the gate …. No, but it did open this other door."
"115740052-0-26202";"This is still my kill, Assassin. When one door opens, the best course is to leap right through."
"115740052-0-26203";"Now's your chance to impress me, Assassin."
"115740052-0-26204";"Show me every flaw, every weakness."
"115740052-0-26205";"If you're the best your Sanctuary can throw against me, they're already all dead!"
"115740052-0-26206";"Not bad for someone who's swinging at shadows!"
"115740052-0-26207";"With each of my shadows you dispatch, I learn one more way to kill you!"
"115740052-0-26208";"Love what you've done with the place. Messy. Sends a message, yeah?"
"115740052-0-26209";"Portcullises over the gates? I didn't expect them to roll out the welcome mat, but this seems excessive. We're going to have to find another way out of here."
"115740052-0-26210";"Ah. Lever. And just out of reach, too. Typical. Find a way up there. It'll open at least one of these gates, I guarantee it."
"115740052-0-26211";"I'll hold this room while you're gone. Don't dawdle, all right?"
"115740052-0-26212";"Sorry. Can't stand these things. Spiderkith. They attacked as soon as you left. We must be on the right track."
"115740052-0-26213";"At least one of the doors is open now. Go have a look. I'll hang back, just in case we get more visitors."
"115740052-0-26214";"That bastard. He didn't even let Geel-Ma die with a knife in his hand."
"115740052-0-26215";"I need a moment to … sort this out. Kill that smoke-skin bastard, Dranos, and we'll regroup afterward."
"115740052-0-26216";"Tsatva-Lan. Funny meeting you here."
"115740052-0-26217";"Hides-the-Ashes … I'm impressed you made it so far. Haven't stopped dragging that right heel on the parry, though. I taught you better than that."
"115740052-0-26218";"Ha. Yes. Well, old friend, it appears that the student has become the teacher. Today's lesson: the price of disloyalty."
"115740052-0-26220";"All right, Tsatva. Time to lick the tree."
"115740052-0-26221";"Haha! You're dead!"
"115740052-0-26222";"Tsatva's gone, isn't he? Damn it. I should have been here. I could have … never mind."
"115740052-0-26225";"Mephala. Night Mother's mercy, I am so sick of looking at her smug face. Remind me to smash this thing when Tsatva's … when we're done."
"115740052-0-26226";"I'll double back to make sure he hasn't fled. You keep going and find this Velidreth."
"115740052-0-26227";"Mmm … new dinner guests. Don't keep me waiting, sweetmeat. I am positively famished!"
"115740052-0-26229";"You are fools to pursue me. Take Hides-the-Ashes and get out of here. This is my final kindness. Leave or die."
"115740052-0-26230";"Mm … getting warmer. It's a shame you're not as smart as Tsatva-Lan. What a delightful servant you'd make!"
"115740052-0-26231";"Hmmm … warmer still. Best hurry, sweetmeat. Tsatva-Lan receives my blessing even as we speak. Killing him may prove … difficult."
"115740052-0-26232";"Mmm. Piping hot! Don't keep me waiting, adventurers. I'm starving!"
"115740052-0-26233";"Welcome, Initiate."
"115740052-0-26234";"Normal Crowd Cheers in Kvatch Arena"
"115740052-0-26235";"Excited Crowd Cheers in Kvatch Arena"
"115740052-0-26236";"It is done, Velador. The remaining Shadowscales are dealt with."
"115740052-0-26237";"I'm afraid you're mistaken, my friend. Another member of your tribe has breached the gates."
"115740052-0-26238";"Hides-the-Ashes. If she is here, she will die like the rest. Now, you wanted proof of my loyalty? Bear witness."
"115740052-0-26239";"Tsatva-Lan, what are you—? You do not need to do this!"
"115740052-0-26241";"No!"
"115740052-0-26242";"Well done, my scaled friend. You have cast off your old skin, and the Silken Ring welcomes you as a brother. Seek out Velidreth and receive your blessing."
"115740052-0-26244";"Creepy little bastard …."
"115740052-0-26246";"Another wave incoming!"
"115740052-0-26247";"We've pushed them back! Great job!"
"115740052-0-26248";"We've pushed them back!"
"115740052-0-26249";"Great job!"
"115740052-0-26251";"I think we're clear on the west. Great Job!"
"115740052-0-26252";"Another group inbound!"
"115740052-0-26253";"Keep Fighting!"
"115740052-0-26254";"Another wave incoming! Keep Fighting!"
"115740052-0-26255";"So abrupt! Don't you want to know why?"
"115740052-0-26256";"Won't make any difference."
"115740052-0-26257";"You can indulge me this one last lesson. A final kindness for an old friend."
"115740052-0-26258";"Fine. Talk."
"115740052-0-26259";"I knew you could be reasonable. The truth is that you are weak. The Shadowscales are weak. The Dark Brotherhood is weak. Your traditions are worthless pretense. It took me a long time to see it. Too long."
"115740052-0-26260";"And these spider-worshipers know better?"
"115740052-0-26261";"They do. Sithis comes for us all, old friend. You kill in his name, but you do not understand his nature. Mephala does. Very soon, she will make you understand. All of you."
"115740052-0-26262";"I look forward to hearing from her. Goodbye, Tsatva-Lan."
"115740052-0-26264";"Pay my respects to Sithis, old man."
"115740052-0-26265";"A supplicant, hungry for power? Come, reaper. Come closer."
"115740052-0-26266";"Now, reaper? Behold, the true bounty of your harvest."
"115740052-0-26267";"Drink deeply!"
"115740052-0-26268";"I heard screeching. Giant spiders? No surprise there … wait."
"115740052-0-26269";"It's the Ring's field captain, Dranos Velador and … no. No, no, no."
"115740052-0-26270";"Wave Horn Audio"
"115740052-0-26273";"That's it! Don't move a muscle."
"115740052-0-26274";"No! Mephala, I'm starving! I'm starving!"
"115740052-0-26278";"Hahaha! On to the next course!"
"115740052-0-26281";"Good. You've made it to the first stone and the amulet is working. I don't have much time, so listen carefully."
"115740052-0-26282";"You have the aetherial power of another of the Warrior's charges. Good."
"115740052-0-26283";"At last, the amulet contains the aetherial energy of all three of the Warrior's charges."
"115740052-0-26284";"Face me, initiate. Prove your mettle in the Trial of Fire."
"115740052-0-26285";"You have bested me and completed the Trial of Fire. Enter Rahni'Za, initiate, and face the remaining trials."
"115740052-0-26286";"The Serpent betrayed us. He poisoned the Warrior's mind and turned him against us."
"115740052-0-26287";"But my hope is that the aetherial energy from the Mundus stones will allow us to weaken the Serpent's grip on the Warrior."
"115740052-0-26288";"The Serpent's followers, the Scaled Court, range all across Craglorn. They found the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-26289";"They weakened the stone with foul magics. I believe that the aetherial power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can restore the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-26290";"Now, hurry. The power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can strengthen the Warrior's Apex Stone and weaken the Serpent's hold."
"115740052-0-26291";"Go to the ruins of Kardala, at the center point from where these stones rest. The Apex Stone lies within."
"115740052-0-26292";"The ruins of Kardala. Tread carefully. The ancient wards protecting this place may still be active."
"115740052-0-26293";"The Apex Stone waits beyond this door. The Warrior's charges will guide your way."
"115740052-0-26294";"The Skystone Amulet is charged with the aetherial power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed. Use it to cleanse the Apex Stone of the Serpent's corruption."
"115740052-0-26295";"Listen closely. I can't appear for long or the Enemy will see. Erold means well, but he can't accomplish the task ahead. You must do this."
"115740052-0-26296";"The Warrior's Apex Stone lies within. It is crucial that you reach it. I feel the eyes of the Serpent searching for us both."
"115740052-0-26297";"Enter the circle, friend."
"115740052-0-26298";"Stars above, let this new light do your will."
"115740052-0-26299";"Let them always follow where you lead."
"115740052-0-26300";"And bless them to restore those who have fallen from glory. Our missing guardians."
"115740052-0-26301";"You have been accepted by the stars above. You are now one of us."
"115740052-0-26302";"Accept them, oh stars."
"115740052-0-26303";"Oh, please aid them."
"115740052-0-26304";"Oh, please bless them."
"115740052-0-26305";"At last, the Warrior's Apex Stone stands before us. I sense the Serpent's power in this place. I must flee before I am ensnared as well."
"115740052-0-26306";"Great Warrior, I am your strength. Forsake this madness and return to health!"
"115740052-0-26307";"Great Warrior, I am your mercy. Forsake this madness and remember peace!"
"115740052-0-26308";"Great Warrior, I am your swiftness. Forsake this madness and ride against our enemy!"
"115740052-0-26309";"You have purged my venom from the Apex Stone. Clever. Too clever for a mortal."
"115740052-0-26310";"She helped you, didn't she? I can smell her fear upon you. No matter. I will find her and consume her in time, just as I have her fellow guardians."
"115740052-0-26311";"Do not think you have succeeded here. The damage remains. The Warrior has fallen from the sky and is trapped in mortal form. He is mine."
"115740052-0-26312";"You think to defeat an army of legend? Fools."
"115740052-0-26313";"I will start the ritual. No doubt the Anka-Ra and their guardians will try to stop me. Be ready."
"115740052-0-26314";"These … things … are making it very hard to concentrate."
"115740052-0-26315";"You must defend me if we hope to finish this ritual!"
"115740052-0-26316";"I don't know if I can keep this up much longer!"
"115740052-0-26317";"The arena is open to challengers! Let the melee begin!"
"115740052-0-26318";"If you wish to begin the trial, you merely need speak to me. You will only get one chance at this."
"115740052-0-26319";"Ready yourselves. The arena is a test of preparation and endurance."
"115740052-0-26320";"Test your knowledge of the art of the blade against me, if you would continue to the trial below."
"115740052-0-26321";"Go into the darkness and may your faith guide your path."
"115740052-0-26322";"What's this? An initiate with the patience, stamina, and strength to best the arena! Come here and speak to me."
"115740052-0-26323";"You have bested the trials and defeated Abelazar. You have earned the name of Sword-Disciple, a name I never expected to confer on anyone ever again."
"115740052-0-26324";"The books were always intended to be about cooperation. You cannot truly learn to master the art of the blade without the help of others. Abelazar charmed us all and made us complicit in our own destruction."
"115740052-0-26325";"A remarkable achievement, to see what is beyond seeing. A test of the Sword-Disciple's faith. If only I had seen more clearly the snake that was among us."
"115740052-0-26326";"I carry the guiding flame. Take me to the braziers so I may light the way."
"115740052-0-26327";"Initiate. With this brazier, you have begun the Trial of Fire. With this trial, you will prove that you are worthy to study among the Sword-Disciples."
"115740052-0-26328";"This is it. The tomb I spoke of. My tomb. A resting place of great honor granted to me by Tarish-Zi himself."
"115740052-0-26329";"You see, I am not of this time. Centuries ago, I sought to end the reign of the self-proclaimed emperor, Tarish-Zi, by working secretly from within his royal guard."
"115740052-0-26330";"The presence of this tomb means that I failed in my mission. Witness—my remains beside a royal seal. The seal is what we are seeking. It is one of the keys needed to enter Tarish-Zi's crypt."
"115740052-0-26331";"The last thing I remember before appearing in this time was the sound of a battle horn. Then I heard the voice of the one you call the Celestial Warrior. Tarish-Zi must have heard the same call. It is why we have appeared in this time."
"115740052-0-26332";"There are two more seals to recover, two more tombs of the royal guard. The vanity of Tarish-Zi will serve us well. He had scribes record every conquest, every monument. They will have written about the burial places of all his retainers."
"115740052-0-26333";"In my time, a great library existed in a place called Rahni'Za. If it's still there, the information we need could be inside. Think on what I've told you. If you decide to believe my tale, meet me at the library."
"115740052-0-26334";"Ah, much better."
"115740052-0-26335";"The tome should be here somewhere. Tarish-Zi would have wanted everyone to know of his glorious deeds."
"115740052-0-26336";"Wait, that's it! Let me see that!"
"115740052-0-26337";"Riza and Tahmin … I know you must be mentioned in here. Ah! Here it is. Both were granted personal burial chambers near the falls to the north. I pray the entrances have not been buried."
"115740052-0-26338";"We should split up to save time. You find Riza and Tahmin's tombs and retrieve their royal seals. I'll go to Tarish-Zi's crypt and scout it out. We need to know what we're facing."
"115740052-0-26339";"When you have the seals, meet me at the crypt. With luck, we can catch Tarish-Zi unawares."
"115740052-0-26340";"Good luck! I'll see you soon."
"115740052-0-26341";"Ah, you made it. Good. And with the seals, too, I see. Then we're ready to proceed."
"115740052-0-26342";"The ward is magical in nature. As long as we have the three seals within its vicinity, the door should freely open to us."
"115740052-0-26343";"Follow me, but stay alert."
"115740052-0-26344";"You can't defeat me. I am a servant of the Scaled Court, herald of the Celestial Serpent! This school belongs to him!"
"115740052-0-26345";"What? The mist? This should not be possible!"
"115740052-0-26346";"Did you think you could escape this fate, false emperor? Even across the aeons, I will find you. And my blade is as sharp as ever, praise Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-26347";"Belkarth is as good a place as any to take respite after our victory. I'm sure you have more questions for me. Find me there if you wish to speak. And well fought!"
"115740052-0-26348";"Fate brought us forward together. We all heard the call to battle. Those poor souls you doomed to a cursed existence will be avenged!"
"115740052-0-26349";"Oblivion take you, false emperor! And may Scamps gnaw on your bones."
"115740052-0-26350";"Ah, that'll be sore tomorrow. Let's get away from here before we're seen. I'll try to grab some proper clothes and a weapon. Meet me at the cave known as Buried Sands. There's something I have to retrieve there. I'll explain more when you arrive."
"115740052-0-26351";"You made it. Good. There's an ancient burial chamber at the rear of this cave—that's where we need to go."
"115740052-0-26352";"The Anka-Ra. The self-proclaimed emperor Tarish-Zi's personal army. Each warrior pledged eternal loyalty to the emperor. The cursed form they wear is the mark of their servitude."
"115740052-0-26353";"If the Anka-Ra have risen from beneath the sands, it can only mean that Tarish-Zi has returned as well. They are bound to him, you see. They rise to his call. Once he ruled these lands—he will seek to do so again."
"115740052-0-26354";"The royal guard gave up their lives when the emperor died, each buried in separate, hidden tombs. With them are the royal seals—the keys to the royal crypt. One such tomb is here. And if I'm right, one of the seals."
"115740052-0-26355";"Here it is. The entrance to the chamber. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-26356";"The relic you hold is called the Skystone Amulet. It will grant you access to the Warrior's Apex Stone—but it is capable of so much more."
"115740052-0-26357";"Go to the Mundus stones of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed. These are the Warrior's charges, whom he has sworn to protect."
"115740052-0-26358";"The Skystone Amulet was designed to capture the aetherial energy of the Mundus stones. You will need that energy for the task ahead. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I've already stayed too long."
"115740052-0-26359";"I … am … reborn!"
"115740052-0-26360";"Forgive me. Forgive us all. We are slaves to a vile serpent. Take mercy on us and end our unnatural existence."
"115740052-0-26361";"I feel the snakes writhing inside my head. Is that what brought me here? No matter. They are hungry—and so am I!"
"115740052-0-26362";"Look, I have this necklace and these rings. They have to be worth something."
"115740052-0-26363";"Get in line. Half the patricians of Elinhir came to Belkarth to sell their valuables. It must be pretty bad over there."
"115740052-0-26364";"Pretty bad? The hedge mages have destroyed most of the city!"
"115740052-0-26365";"Well, I can't give you anything for these."
"115740052-0-26366";"No, listen. My family is well-respected in Stormhaven. I can get you lots of valuables. I just need to get out of Craglorn!"
"115740052-0-26367";"I hear the Gold Coast Trading Company needs caravan guards."
"115740052-0-26368";"Don't you have any heart at all?"
"115740052-0-26369";"You want to cry me a river? Go ahead. Maybe you can float out of Craglorn."
"115740052-0-26370";"I've had about enough of this. They can't pay me enough to protect these caravans."
"115740052-0-26371";"You're telling me. You know what attacked us the other day? Warriors made out of stone! How are you supposed to fight such creatures? We left the carts in the middle of the road and ran."
"115740052-0-26372";"I think I'll go to Dragonstar. There's an arena up there. Lots of gold for the taking."
"115740052-0-26373";"Fighting in the arena has got to be safer than guarding the caravans, anyhow."
"115740052-0-26374";"And what exactly am I supposed to do with a wagon full of goods and no one to buy them, huh?"
"115740052-0-26375";"I don't know. What do you usually do with them?"
"115740052-0-26376";"I have a standing order with those strange warriors at the Rahni'Za Sword School. Someone usually comes to pick it up, but they haven't shown up this month."
"115740052-0-26377";"I'm going to lose my shirt here. If they don't pick up their order, I don't get paid."
"115740052-0-26378";"Better find a way to deliver the order yourself."
"115740052-0-26379";"You mean cart the goods up a road that's crawling with sand warriors and wild creatures? To a school where they lop off the heads of the unworthy? No thank you. I'll just wait here."
"115740052-0-26380";"Someone's bound to show up eventually."
"115740052-0-26381";"Approach my statue. Speak to me."
"115740052-0-26382";"Shada's minions! To my aid!"
"115740052-0-26383";"One must use fire to forge the blade and destroy their enemies!"
"115740052-0-26384";"To forge a fine weapon, one needs heat!"
"115740052-0-26385";"And finally, one must purge the weapon in the water's frost!"
"115740052-0-26386";"We must talk. Do not be afraid. I am a friend."
"115740052-0-26387";"Thank the stars! I wasn't sure I'd find anyone else out here. Please, I need your help."
"115740052-0-26388";"The books have been gathered and the fires of knowledge shall melt away the barrier."
"115740052-0-26389";"See my newest creation!"
"115740052-0-26390";"Rahni'za will no longer stand for this corruption. The school will protect those true to its cause!"
"115740052-0-26391";"You have also freed those souls that have been trapped under the Scaled Court. For that, I cannot thank you enough."
"115740052-0-26392";"The ritual is complete. Thank you. I don't know how long it will hold, but the Anka-Ra will not be able to rise in this place, for now."
"115740052-0-26393";"The Sword-Disciple must be focused, pure of will, and indomitable of spirit. The flames of the Trial of Fire represent these qualities—burning brightly and intensely on the path to Rahni'Za."
"115740052-0-26394";"Just as a crucible burns away impurities, so the Trial of Fire eliminates those who are unworthy to enter Rahni'Za. The last brazier is lit. Kalith the Guardian awaits. Best him and you will overcome the Trial of Fire."
"115740052-0-26395";"To me! Slay the intruders."
"115740052-0-26396";"At last. The seals have been activated and we can enter the temple. But be careful. Who knows what has awoken inside since the Celestials appeared."
"115740052-0-26397";"Look. The seal activated one of the beams. We should find the other seals."
"115740052-0-26398";"The way the Anka-Ra guard these seals, I wonder if they put them here to begin with."
"115740052-0-26399";"Prince of Fate, Lord of Secrets. Your Seeker, Ibrula, has returned to you."
"115740052-0-26400";"Approach me, Seeker."
"115740052-0-26401";"Your offering, my lord. A relic from the Dragontail mountains, covered in runes of an unknown language."
"115740052-0-26402";"Your gift is accepted. Tell your companions to approach me."
"115740052-0-26403";"Hermaeus Mora wants to speak with you. Approach his statue."
"115740052-0-26404";"Hermaeus Mora's shrine waits down below. It seems he has summoned Daedra to protect the shrine since the Celestials appeared. Be careful."
"115740052-0-26405";"The Lord of Knowledge. The Prince of Secrets. We're nearly there."
"115740052-0-26406";"The shadows take you!"
"115740052-0-26407";"The door's open. Hurry. We have to find Nahlia."
"115740052-0-26408";"I can't go any further with these undead in the way. Come talk to me if you need any information."
"115740052-0-26409";"Thank you for releasing me from the curse. Please, speak to me as you leave this chamber. I don't have much time before my spirit fades."
"115740052-0-26410";"Ah, merciful death. It is good to be in my right mind again. Speak to me before you leave this chamber."
"115740052-0-26411";"What have I become? There can be no forgiveness for what I've done, but speak to me before you leave this chamber and I will try to right the wrongs I've committed."
"115740052-0-26412";"Thank you for freeing me. I was sure I would die here in this cold, wet pit."
"115740052-0-26413";"The waters must remain blessed. Shada wills it!"
"115740052-0-26414";"You found her. She's … she's okay, isn't she?"
"115740052-0-26415";"Nhalan, you speak of treason! Do you want the Yokudans to come here, pillage everything we've built, murder us all? Do you want that?"
"115740052-0-26416";"Once Shada blesses us, no power in the world will stop us."
"115740052-0-26417";"Away, phantom! Unless you are here to free me, I will have none of you."
"115740052-0-26418";"I'm no phantom, Kelmen Locke. I am the Celestial Thief. And you know why I am here."
"115740052-0-26419";"Just another bandit then? I've already been robbed blind. There's nothing more to take from me."
"115740052-0-26420";"The atronachs. The Celestial Mage showed you how to summon them in a dream. Do you remember? Why have they turned against Craglorn?"
"115740052-0-26421";"Oh no. No more Celestial Mages and Serpents! I've had enough of all that! I saw what happened to the others and that won't happen to me."
"115740052-0-26422";"One second."
"115740052-0-26423";"I think I can make a crack in the ward!"
"115740052-0-26424";"That's … it! The ward is no more. That took everything I had …."
"115740052-0-26425";"Better a quick death to Yokudan steel than a lifetime as slaves to those creatures. We should call on the stars for protection—as our ancestors did—and have nothing to do with these Nereids and their sorcery!"
"115740052-0-26426";"I've heard enough. Take him to Shada."
"115740052-0-26427";"You must defend the crypts at all costs. The Yokudans must not make it through here until the ritual is complete!"
"115740052-0-26428";"This barrier should keep the Yokudans out while we finalize the ritual with Shada. The sacrifice you make by staying behind to guard it is appreciated, Mahvia."
"115740052-0-26429";"Don't thank me. Thank those who offered themselves for my … experiments. The creature they gave life to will protect this barrier for eternity."
"115740052-0-26430";"See that it does. That creature's magic keeps this barrier held in place. It is the only thing that can keep the Yokudans out."
"115740052-0-26431";"We give our flesh, our minds, and our souls to protect this city and its people against the invaders."
"115740052-0-26432";"So as long as this creation of our bodies stands, so too will the ward that protects these crypts. May I meet you in the stars my brothers and sisters."
"115740052-0-26433";"None shall get past our creation!"
"115740052-0-26434";"With this binding, our pact is sealed. Are you ready to pledge your lives to me and receive in return the strength to drive the invaders from your doors?"
"115740052-0-26435";"I will not permit our people to be slaughtered in their very homes. Do with us what you will, and grant us victory this day!"
"115740052-0-26436";"Then I take your soul and the souls of all those present to seal this oath. So long as these phylacteries lie undisturbed, our oath will remain unbroken and your soul will be at rest."
"115740052-0-26437";"Finally … this life is over. I can rest now."
"115740052-0-26438";"If you are to go after Shada, you will need to defeat her maiden below who corrupts the water. I … wish you the best."
"115740052-0-26439";"Do not worry, my dear Vhasla. This one will find a way to free you from the horrors you face."
"115740052-0-26440";"Who sent you? It was Nhalan wasn't it? After all these years, he is still a traitor!"
"115740052-0-26441";"You cannot stop me! My strength comes from Shada herself."
"115740052-0-26442";"I saved our people! The Yokudans would have slaughtered them! I alone had the courage to do what was necessary to save us all!"
"115740052-0-26443";"Give yourself to Shada. It is useless to resist."
"115740052-0-26444";"So you're saying the water just … cleared up? On its own?"
"115740052-0-26445";"You said wandering adventurers from the surface came down here. What did you send them to do, Sali'ma?"
"115740052-0-26446";"I wondered if some of the corruption originated from the wings on either side. I merely asked them to investigate."
"115740052-0-26447";"It looks like it worked. Maybe we'll actually find something now."
"115740052-0-26448";"Murderer! Slaughterer of innocents! These people are under my protection! I alone gave them hope! I alone gave them a future! Leave now and I will spare you. Enter, and your fate will be the same as the Yokudans before you!"
"115740052-0-26449";"You are not our master. We do not serve mortal flesh."
"115740052-0-26450";"Who do you serve?"
"115740052-0-26451";"The Mage. She created us. Imbued us with thought. But she has fallen, corrupted by the Serpent who crawls on his belly."
"115740052-0-26452";"The waves of the nereids will carry you away!"
"115740052-0-26453";"The water will not let you escape!"
"115740052-0-26454";"Why must you resist us? Let the waters run through you!"
"115740052-0-26455";"Be quick and stay quiet. It's the only certain way to remain alive."
"115740052-0-26456";"You have the energy. Good. I've created magic foci to receive each element."
"115740052-0-26457";"One person must channel on the staff and three others on the foci. This will open the way."
"115740052-0-26458";"Good work. I'll meet you inside."
"115740052-0-26459";"What is this place? It's like some other plane inside this object. But where are we? Oblivion? Aetherius?"
"115740052-0-26460";"Interesting. It looks like it's possible to cross between the islands."
"115740052-0-26461";"This is such a strange place. You never know what's going to happen next."
"115740052-0-26462";"A word, if you will, my friend. I believe I can be of help."
"115740052-0-26463";"Hmm, no path here. Let me see if I can do anything with these floating rocks."
"115740052-0-26464";"I read a story once about Arch-Mage Shalidor fashioning a bridge out of pieces of shattered glass. This requires … much less effort."
"115740052-0-26465";"Hm. It looks like I'll be able to contain the core once these crystals are disconnected."
"115740052-0-26466";"The core is releasing a lot of magicka. We need to be careful, especially when I disconnect the crystals."
"115740052-0-26467";"Magicka will pour out when I disconnect the crystal. You'll need to defend me, or we won't be able to finish."
"115740052-0-26468";"There's the core on the far side of these floating islands. We have to stop it from overloading."
"115740052-0-26469";"Now, how are we going to get over there?"
"115740052-0-26470";"Now I just have to cast a barrier around the core. Wish me luck!"
"115740052-0-26471";"Hara! What's wrong?"
"115740052-0-26472";"Uhf. We did it. We sealed the core. Give me a minute to catch my breath."
"115740052-0-26473";"All right. All better. Let's get going."
"115740052-0-26474";"Time is not on our—"
"115740052-0-26475";"What are you doing here? No one is supposed to enter here. Are you another of the Serpent's slaves? Go away!"
"115740052-0-26476";"Hm. Seems like there's some kind of guardian here. She's so far gone she doesn't realize how bad the core's gotten."
"115740052-0-26477";"I will not let you compromise the core. This is my staff. This is my power, not yours, foul Serpent!"
"115740052-0-26478";"There's definitely something still active here. I can feel the magicka pulsing in these stones."
"115740052-0-26479";"You defy me then. Very well. I will not allow you to destroy my people. Instead, I will destroy you."
"115740052-0-26480";"The way to me won't be that easy. But continue if you must. My pet awaits you and he's hungry."
"115740052-0-26481";"Even nature itself has joined with me. Why do you resist? Why not join me? I can give you all the power you would ever need, just as I gave power to the people of this city!"
"115740052-0-26482";"Have you ever watched a spider play with its food? It's exhilarating."
"115740052-0-26483";"You kill innocent creatures that only wish to live. Spiders, Nedes, it matters not to you, does it? The thrill of the kill. Just like the Yokudans, you lay waste to everything in your path."
"115740052-0-26484";"Doesn't it gnaw at you? All these years, buried beneath the sands, and suddenly a hole opens and there it is—the lost city! It's no coincidence. There are forces at work that you should fear far more than you fear me."
"115740052-0-26485";"Be careful where you step, mortal. These Nereids are my shield maidens. They empower those I protect. They could empower you, if only you would give yourself to me."
"115740052-0-26486";"Those who once walked among the stars now tread upon the ground, destroying everything in their path. Don't you want to defeat them? All you need to do is drink the water …."
"115740052-0-26487";"Murderer! I opened my city to you. I offered you hope and you repay me with destruction! Fine. Then let the destroyer be destroyed!"
"115740052-0-26488";"Your resistance ends here. I will bend you to my will. Make you commander of my armies. Not even the Celestials will stand against us!"
"115740052-0-26489";"Maidens, give me your power and protection!"
"115740052-0-26490";"No. I will not be defeated. I will devour you!"
"115740052-0-26491";"This one won't let you perish, Saraali!"
"115740052-0-26492";"She does not arouse from her slumber …. What did this one miss?"
"115740052-0-26493";"This one's still bleeding …."
"115740052-0-26494";"Shada is dead! The waters are safe, and so … refreshing.\n\nHurry. Gather the injured for treatment. And let's not forget the ones we've lost."
"115740052-0-26495";"You are no match for the ancient magic of my most powerful servant."
"115740052-0-26496";"And this is why you should inform this Hara of yours immediately. It is urgent that we speak to her."
"115740052-0-26497";"Yes, we are wasting time repeating ourselves to a … lackey."
"115740052-0-26498";"I'm trying to understand what you just told me. There are other versions of you elsewhere in Craglorn?"
"115740052-0-26499";"As we explained—and with exceptional clarity—we are merely aspects of the one you call the Celestial Mage. Even as we stand here, the Serpent seeks to control us all!"
"115740052-0-26500";"Even now he gathers our aspects to use as his own, assembling them into a false Mage who is entirely in his control."
"115740052-0-26501";"Yes, of course. Whatever you say. I'll talk to Hara, but I can't make any promises. The constellations have disappeared from the sky and we have other things to deal with right now."
"115740052-0-26502";"The stars shine before him, pleading for help, and he's too busy looking at the empty sky to realize it."
"115740052-0-26503";"A drink, then, to ease our patience. You, mortal servant, deliver us your finest—what's the word—ale?"
"115740052-0-26504";"Ale? But the brewer serves drinks in the other room …."
"115740052-0-26505";"Quickly, dive to the passageway! We'll follow behind you!"
"115740052-0-26506";"There! In the center! A passage must have opened below the water!"
"115740052-0-26507";"The Scaled One grows stronger. Another part of us has been lost."
"115740052-0-26508";"The Snake eats and eats and never grows full. His hunger is endless."
"115740052-0-26509";"Our time grows short. But the mortal has returned with the Seeker's Sight."
"115740052-0-26510";"Then converse with our helper. If the Serpent continues to feast, no power will be able to stand against him."
"115740052-0-26511";"Hara has finally agreed to see us and we will meet with her soon. Do not delay. The enemy grows strong and time is not on our side."
"115740052-0-26512";"Thank you again. I should check in at the Mages Guild and give my report. We can determine how we want to handle the Staff from there."
"115740052-0-26513";"Hara! What have you done to her?"
"115740052-0-26514";"He found me … you must …."
"115740052-0-26515";"Nothing! Something just came over her. Hara, what can we do?"
"115740052-0-26516";"Who found you? Who is doing this to you?"
"115740052-0-26517";"Find the ruins … Reinhold's Retreat …. Hidden there … you must …."
"115740052-0-26518";"A strange relic, this Seeker's Sight. It's a compass of sorts, you say?"
"115740052-0-26519";"Well, place it within the star map and let's see what happens."
"115740052-0-26520";"<Anguished scream.>"
"115740052-0-26521";"No!"
"115740052-0-26522";"She's gone … just … gone."
"115740052-0-26523";"It's working. See how our other aspects appear."
"115740052-0-26524";"Thanks to this relic, we can locate the remaining aspects before the Scaled One."
"115740052-0-26525";"What is that strange one over there? It's different from the others."
"115740052-0-26526";"That's the Lost One. The part of us corrupted and controlled by the Scaled One."
"115740052-0-26527";"Let's not concern ourselves with her just yet. The other aspects are our first priority."
"115740052-0-26528";"Do not worry about me. I can reach the other aspects on my own."
"115740052-0-26529";"If you have other tasks, I suggest you hurry. The Lost One continues to grow in power."
"115740052-0-26530";"Watch yourself as you exit this cave. You resemble food to the residents of this place."
"115740052-0-26531";"When you finish your tasks, meet us back at this winery. We will proceed with our plan from there."
"115740052-0-26532";"I'll find Kelmen and meet you at the lake. Nazdura, come. There's nothing more we can do for Hara here."
"115740052-0-26533";"You made it. Good. We could not proceed without you."
"115740052-0-26534";"The aspects have been gathered. It is time to confront the Lost One."
"115740052-0-26535";"We know exactly where she hides. At the beginning. At the source of our power."
"115740052-0-26536";"Spineless worms. Did you not think we would come for her? Did you not know you would bring our wrath upon your heads?"
"115740052-0-26537";"The stench of corruption pervades the air. Be wary. A powerful practitioner of dark sorcery is nearby."
"115740052-0-26538";"You're too late. The Apex Stone is ours! The Thief will fall under my master's sway and none will be left to stand against us!"
"115740052-0-26539";"Hah! None can stand before us. We're coming, Hara! Just hold on!"
"115740052-0-26540";"She mentioned another Apex Stone. Could it be that the Thief's stone has been hidden here all along?"
"115740052-0-26541";"There! The Apex Stone! What are they doing to it? Is this how they corrupt the stones and enslave the Guardians?"
"115740052-0-26542";"Look! It's Hara! Why would they have her here? We have to find a way to free her!"
"115740052-0-26543";"On your guard, friends. Enemies lie in wait ahead. Scaled Court by the looks of them."
"115740052-0-26544";"The Lost One waits for us. She knows we are coming."
"115740052-0-26545";"I sense her presence. Below. She waits in the shadow of our Apex Stone."
"115740052-0-26546";"Defeat the Lost One and we will do the rest."
"115740052-0-26547";"Do not hold back. If you hesitate or falter, the Lost One will destroy you."
"115740052-0-26548";"Good gods, these High Elves are mad."
"115740052-0-26549";"You mean the Celestial Mage? The Serpent controls the Mage? How is that possible?"
"115740052-0-26550";"Trickery. Deceit. And once he controlled her, he turned her power against us and enslaved us."
"115740052-0-26551";"Why go to all this trouble?"
"115740052-0-26552";"Because that is what the Serpent does. He has used the Mage to create a new monarch. One with all of our powers. One made of pure air."
"115740052-0-26553";"Where can we find this new monarch?"
"115740052-0-26554";"We do not know. All we remember is a name. Balamath."
"115740052-0-26555";"Balamath? I know that place. It's an Ayleid ruin. Thank you. You are dismissed."
"115740052-0-26556";"Defeat the Serpent's abomination. Defeat the Monarch of Air and we will tell our master of your kindness."
"115740052-0-26557";"All right—break's over, squirt. Get back to work."
"115740052-0-26558";"Break? I'm not on a break! I'm on lookout duty."
"115740052-0-26559";"Lookout? What in Oblivion are you looking out for?"
"115740052-0-26560";"Raiders! Slavers! Rabid miners! It's dangerous out here. Gotta keep these keen eyes on the horizon!"
"115740052-0-26561";"Good point. There's just no telling how many brigands want to steal our hoard of totally worthless stone."
"115740052-0-26562";"Well … there could be gems in those stones."
"115740052-0-26563";"There could be gems in your head. Should I grab a pick and find out?"
"115740052-0-26564";"Fine, fine. I'm on my way. Gotta, y'know, find my pick and such.  Might take a minute … or ten."
"115740052-0-26565";"The others are near. I can sense them. You think to stop me? I am too strong for you, mortal. I cannot be defeated."
"115740052-0-26566";"Fools! This stone is the source of my strength. You cannot defeat me here."
"115740052-0-26567";"You know, it's very unsettling the way you pop in and out like that."
"115740052-0-26568";"I wouldn't be a very good Thief if I couldn't come and go as I please."
"115740052-0-26569";"Well, I've done what you asked of me. Are you satisfied?"
"115740052-0-26570";"You have done well and I appreciate your efforts. Thanks to you, the Star-Gazers now understand the nature of the atronach threat and how to stop it."
"115740052-0-26571";"Lost One. Surrender yourself. Shake off the Serpent's control. You have lost. Join with us of your own free will and we shall be whole again."
"115740052-0-26572";"The Lost One's pull is strong. Hold fast, sisters. We must … resist the Serpent's grip."
"115740052-0-26573";"We have weakened the Lost One, but we are not strong enough to expel the Serpent on our own. You must find us and stop us!"
"115740052-0-26574";"Gods save us if Craglorn falls to these monsters."
"115740052-0-26575";"Use the gem on each stone focus to summon the atronachs."
"115740052-0-26576";"Wait, I'll open a portal so you can get out of the city."
"115740052-0-26577";"That should send you to the refugees outside of the city. I'm going to help the rest of the civilians in Elinhir to escape. Thank you for your help."
"115740052-0-26578";"How do we stop it?"
"115740052-0-26579";"These aetherial stones are linked. I see now! Split off and use them both before their power fades!"
"115740052-0-26580";"Quickly, before more arrive!"
"115740052-0-26581";"Fascinating! She knew this place was protected by aetherial power! A trap set by a Thief for a … a thief."
"115740052-0-26582";"Hah! We've done it!"
"115740052-0-26583";"Why do I get the feeling this isn't over?"
"115740052-0-26584";"We will not fall here!"
"115740052-0-26585";"You always underestimated the will of the true heroes of this world, Malazar! Witness the foreshadowing of your doom!"
"115740052-0-26586";"These mortals will see to it that your chaos is undone. We will reunite the Guardians, and you will be banished once more!"
"115740052-0-26587";"Could it really be…?"
"115740052-0-26588";"Hara… You? All along?"
"115740052-0-26589";"It had to be this way. But the time for deception is ended. Now is the time for action."
"115740052-0-26590";"This one sees a little worm! Come, little worm. We will feast on you."
"115740052-0-26591";"I have eaten bigger bites than you, little morsel."
"115740052-0-26592";"So much delicious magicka. Sweeter than moon-sugar pastries!"
"115740052-0-26593";"I should have eaten Minerva's soul first. I will fix that mistake, when I'm done with you."
"115740052-0-26594";"You were one of them? Mages like you destroyed our city!"
"115740052-0-26595";"Minerva had no part in this. She's only tried to help us, Rithanion. Your fight isn't with her!"
"115740052-0-26596";"No, she's right. I didn't help the Blackcasters, but I didn't stop them either. I must accept some of the blame."
"115740052-0-26597";"Come closer! Time for this one to feast!"
"115740052-0-26598";"You struggle in vain!"
"115740052-0-26599";"This one cannot be defeated!"
"115740052-0-26600";"You won't win, Malazar. I am too strong for you!"
"115740052-0-26601";"You underestimate me, Valla. I have more tricks at my disposal than you could ever imagine."
"115740052-0-26602";"I have drawn you out of your Apex Stone and made you vulnerable. I know the power you wield. I am not fool enough to try to swallow you whole. But a piece at a time …."
"115740052-0-26603";"I will not let you do this. I will stop you!"
"115740052-0-26604";"Protest as you will, but I have already won."
"115740052-0-26605";"Interesting. These stones seem to be designed as magical defenses, though they lay dormant now. I wonder what other secrets regarding the Nedes have been lost to time."
"115740052-0-26606";"I refuse to be troll food, you—wait, you're not an Iron Orc! You've got to help us! The Butcher is feeding our people to his trolls!"
"115740052-0-26607";"Ah! More meat for the trolls!"
"115740052-0-26608";"Are you lost, little goat? Will it scream when my fire licks its flesh?"
"115740052-0-26609";"These Iron Orcs are no fun at all! I had such high hopes for the diplomatic method."
"115740052-0-26610";"You really showed up! Of course you did. I know how to pick them."
"115740052-0-26611";"Safa sends more pawns? Very well. Feel the bite of the true Serpent!"
"115740052-0-26612";"What do you seek, little rat? Don't you fear the Serpent's sharp tooth?"
"115740052-0-26613";"Who dares interrupt—? Damn you, Safa! Can I never be free of your fangs?"
"115740052-0-26614";"We must shed Satakal's old skin, brothers and sisters. Only then can we know the true Serpent. Together we will make this leap of faith!"
"115740052-0-26615";"Yes, yes. I see it now. The true Serpent has opened my eyes. Arise, my slave!"
"115740052-0-26616";"The Serpent welcomes you into the fold, Mazaluhad. I trust you brought more recruits?"
"115740052-0-26617";"As we agreed. Safa will be furious, but these disciples are yours to command."
"115740052-0-26618";"No… No! Little Leaf!"
"115740052-0-26619";"No! Not Little Leaf!"
"115740052-0-26620";"The Serpent wants to return the world to a more primitive state. Once I discovered that, I knew I had to oppose him."
"115740052-0-26621";"Let's finish this grim business. Then I'll have one less thing to worry about as I work to break the Serpent's hold."
"115740052-0-26622";"Present yourself, Regent Boward. The mantikora project is at an end."
"115740052-0-26623";"Regent Cassipia? What is the meaning of this?"
"115740052-0-26624";"Watch your tone, regent! Your abomination is dead. Will you abandon the Serpent and join me?"
"115740052-0-26625";"Abandon the Serpent? I would never do that!"
"115740052-0-26626";"Very well, Boward. Join your abomination in Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-26627";"Boward gave me no choice. My actions must remain secret. Come talk to me after you free the prisoners."
"115740052-0-26628";"By the Three, I thought I was done for!"
"115740052-0-26629";"They were going to toss us in that disgusting pool with that horrible beast! Thank you for rescuing us!"
"115740052-0-26630";"This one is very happy not to be dead right now."
"115740052-0-26631";"That's the last time I accept an invitation from a mysterious robed figure. Thanks for setting us free!"
"115740052-0-26632";"Look how they blindly follow the Serpent's orders. His venomous lies have poisoned their minds."
"115740052-0-26633";"The scorpion matron's den should be nearby. Prepare yourself. The matron and her brood will be deadly opponents."
"115740052-0-26634";"Slay the progenitor and its handlers, then check on the prisoners. If any remain alive, release them."
"115740052-0-26635";"Do you like the lute? I play. A little. Cassi says I'm good, but I think she's just being nice."
"115740052-0-26636";"I have to send word to Cassi. I'll meet you at the Valley of Scars!"
"115740052-0-26637";"Keep your weapons sheathed. I won't hurt you."
"115740052-0-26638";"What a view! It's so beautiful."
"115740052-0-26639";"How do you do it? All this running around and fighting? I'm exhausted!"
"115740052-0-26640";"What's brown and sticky?"
"115740052-0-26641";"You're nice. I know, because I'm a remarkable judge of character."
"115740052-0-26642";"Well, that's done! There's just one more thing to take care of—Exarch Braadoth. His throne room is deep inside the mountain, behind the ostentatious door to the north."
"115740052-0-26643";"Gaze upon my most magnificent creation and prove to me the power of your soul. Destroy my Gravelord—if you can."
"115740052-0-26644";"Now that you're here, let's go take care of the runescriber and the armorer."
"115740052-0-26645";"Please, enjoy my collection. The fallen kings are among my most prized possessions."
"115740052-0-26646";"Yes, your soul is powerful indeed! Don't worry about my creation. I can rebuild him."
"115740052-0-26647";"A stick!"
"115740052-0-26648";"How considerate, delivering your soul into my waiting hands. Join me in the depths and I will teach you to embrace death."
"115740052-0-26649";"The foolish Watchers pledged to make sure I never awoke. Now, even they serve me."
"115740052-0-26650";"A brilliant display of savagery and raw power. You will make an excellent commander for my legions."
"115740052-0-26651";"Come closer. Prove the strength of your glorious soul. Reach me, and I will free you from the shackles of your mortal flesh and grant you a superior form."
"115740052-0-26652";"Ah, I forgot to mention. The Nedes warded this door, using their curious brand of soul magic. Allow me to provide the souls you need to proceed."
"115740052-0-26653";"Ah, more guests? Welcome. The others have already started their meal."
"115740052-0-26654";"Foolish mortals! You never learn. To one such as I, death is never the end—it is only the beginning! You have achieved nothing. I will return."
"115740052-0-26655";"As glorious as I expected. Any other soul would be in tatters after all you endured. Yet see how it shines with such brilliant incandescence. I must have it!"
"115740052-0-26656";"Ilthag Ironblood! Will you please stop training those nasty trolls?"
"115740052-0-26657";"Get it? It's a Wood Elf joke!"
"115740052-0-26658";"Not this again, whelp! Away with you!"
"115740052-0-26659";"Oh, well. I tried. The better plan it is."
"115740052-0-26660";"I'm here! Do you see, just outside? The fell beast I told you about. Let me restore these wards before it notices what we're doing."
"115740052-0-26661";"There's a door around the corner, to the left. That should take us to the Sanctum of Farsight."
"115740052-0-26662";"Hold a moment, my lady. Let me assist you."
"115740052-0-26663";"Light the fires on the six pedestals. The flames will not burn long, so be quick!"
"115740052-0-26664";"Well done! With the farsight ritual complete, I can now locate the source of the magical disturbance."
"115740052-0-26665";"Meet me at the top of the rise. We must find a way to reach this would-be Celestial before she transforms."
"115740052-0-26666";"Dear Kelmen is here to stop us, Little Leaf, not to perform tricks for your amusement. He fears the power I'll wield as the Exalted Viper."
"115740052-0-26667";"This is madness, Cassipia. What are you thinking? No mortal can contain the power of a constellation!"
"115740052-0-26668";"You never had any ambition, Kelmen. No vision. When I become the Serpent's equal, with the power of a celestial at my command, I can make this world a better place."
"115740052-0-26669";"By destroying Belkarth? How does that make the world a better place? Little Leaf, surely you don't support Cassipia's mad dream."
"115740052-0-26670";"That's enough, you old drunk. Belkarth represents what's wrong with the current age. Once I destroy it, I can finally begin creating a new and better world."
"115740052-0-26671";"No, Cassipia. I won't let you do this!"
"115740052-0-26672";"Not Cassipia, dear Kelmen. I am the Exalted Viper!"
"115740052-0-26673";"Activate the triggers to summon the bridge."
"115740052-0-26674";"Stay alert! We aren't finished yet!"
"115740052-0-26675";"There! The first ward is sealed once more. Stay alert! The other three summoning circles are still active!"
"115740052-0-26676";"So far, so good, but we aren't done yet. More of these creatures could appear at any moment. Just keep them away from me awhile longer."
"115740052-0-26677";"One ward remains and then the prisons will be sealed again! Do not falter!"
"115740052-0-26678";"Well done! With the wards restored, those creatures should trouble us no more. Take a moment to … wait! It's aware of our presence. The fell beast approaches!"
"115740052-0-26679";"Remarkable! We actually did it. The wards have been restored and our mistake has been corrected. Now I need to leave this place. Find me outside and we shall speak of what transpired here."
"115740052-0-26680";"Keep these creatures away from me while I restore the ancient wards!"
"115740052-0-26681";"Stones and steel protect me!"
"115740052-0-26682";"It cannot defeat Agganor! The Stones will not allow it!"
"115740052-0-26684";"Kelmen, can you still do that trick with the dead bugs? That was my favorite!"
"115740052-0-26685";"Use this portal to return to the Observatory in Belkarth. I will meet you there."
"115740052-0-26686";"I am the Exalted Viper! I shall not be denied my place in the sky!"
"115740052-0-26688";"Kelmen! No!"
"115740052-0-26689";"You dare break our agreement, whelp? Your betrayal will not go unpunished!"
"115740052-0-26690";"I have trained newborn cubs that hit harder than that!"
"115740052-0-26691";"You seek to put an end to Kulth? Kulth does not think that will work out well for you."
"115740052-0-26692";"You won't stop our army! You can't!"
"115740052-0-26693";"It seeks to test my weapons? My armor? The audacity!"
"115740052-0-26694";"Too late, little goats, too late. The prepared trolls have already been sent to the Exarch."
"115740052-0-26695";"Regent Cassipia! You must not continue upon this dangerous path."
"115740052-0-26696";"No! You don't understand! Leave us alone and everything will be fine."
"115740052-0-26697";"I won't let you hurt my Cassi!"
"115740052-0-26698";"Come back to me, Little Leaf."
"115740052-0-26699";"I only sought … to make things … better …."
"115740052-0-26700";"Take up my blade, Titus Valerius. You have earned it. Let its might flow through you and remind you who and what you are—a warrior true!"
"115740052-0-26701";"Kulth eats Wood Elves! Well, that's what I heard. We have to stop him from inscribing trolls with nirncrux."
"115740052-0-26702";"This nirncrux armor is tricky stuff. Without the armorer, the Iron Orcs won't be able to dress up their troll army."
"115740052-0-26703";"I feel stronger. My memories return! Celestial Warrior, hear me! I have done all you have demanded. I have served faithfully. Now, please, send me home."
"115740052-0-26704";"My comrades! My friends. Never have I fought beside more noble heroes. This may be farewell, but I will not forget you. Fight on, and never let your values falter. With you, I know the future is in capable hands."
"115740052-0-26705";"Larisa … beloved. My part in this war is over. I'm coming home."
"115740052-0-26706";"You are my champion, Titus, in whom I am well pleased. Hold tightly to the blade. It will travel with you and serve you well in your own time."
"115740052-0-26707";"Do not fear. The story of Titus Valerius recounts one of the greatest warriors to ever walk the surface of Tamriel. His achievements echo even into the future. Perhaps the same will be true of you."
"115740052-0-26708";"There has to be something here!"
"115740052-0-26730";"What's this? New challengers have entered the arena! Cheer or boo, it's up to you!"
"115740052-0-26731";"The new arrivals are running away! Is that even allowed?"
"115740052-0-26732";"The challengers stand victorious! Hold on, the Arena Master is signaling for a main event. Now the real contest begins!"
"115740052-0-26733";"Challengers, prepare to face the champions of the Kvatch Arena—the Order of the Hour!"
"115740052-0-26734";"Look at them run! But who can blame them?"
"115740052-0-26735";"I don't believe it! The challengers have bested the Order of the Hour champ—no, I spoke too soon!"
"115740052-0-26736";"Knight Commander Panthius demands to meet these challengers in battle!"
"115740052-0-26737";"Knight Commander Panthius and his enforcers will lay down the law! And the penalty is death!"
"115740052-0-26738";"The Knight Commander's enforcers are the Order's most battle-hardened veterans. The challengers are doomed!"
"115740052-0-26739";"The beasts are hungry! The challengers will give the walls a wide berth unless they want to become a meal."
"115740052-0-26740";"How many cages are down there? If the challengers keep trying to climb the walls, we might find out!"
"115740052-0-26741";"They've done it! They've dropped the axe on Knight Commander Panthius!"
"115740052-0-26742";"It looks like the challengers have been judged and found wanting! Another crushing victory for the Order of the Hour!"
"115740052-0-26743";"The Order of the Hour wins again! We'll give the challengers a moment to lick their wounds before we let them try again."
"115740052-0-26744";"When Knight Commander Panthius delivers a beating, he does it with style! Will the challengers try again? We'll know in a moment!"
"115740052-0-26745";"Insects thrashing against the web. Delightful."
"115740052-0-26746";"Lady, forgive me!"
"115740052-0-26747";"The Lady will toy with you … and you will beg for death before it's over."
"115740052-0-26748";"Well, well … what brings a slave to our audience chamber?"
"115740052-0-26749";"I bring tidings from my august patron, Magister Therana. She would have your masters know that this slave, Sun-in-Shadow, has earned her favor."
"115740052-0-26750";"What? Magister Therana would lend her good name to this … thing? Preposterous!"
"115740052-0-26751";"Ralasa, don't be as tiresome as your master."
"115740052-0-26753";"Can we move this along, please?"
"115740052-0-26754";"Very well. Magister Therana, by right of rank, demands that the slave girl, Sun-in-Shadow, be freed from her bonds and raised up to a Hireling of the Great House Telvanni. She belongs to Magister Otheri, does she not?"
"115740052-0-26755";"If there's nothing else? I have urgent business in Tel Mora."
"115740052-0-26756";"Indeed. My most beneficent patron, Magister Otheri, acquiesces to Magister Therana's demands. He is confident that Therana will remember this kindness in the future. Sun-in-Shadow, you are hereby freed and lifted up to the rank of hireling."
"115740052-0-26757";"My most majestic patron, Magister Gothren, warns you all. Lift up one of these beasts and a thousand more will follow. This is folly!"
"115740052-0-26758";"Thieves! Intruders! These slaves belong to the Xit-Xaht!"
"115740052-0-26759";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26760";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26761";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26762";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26763";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26764";"<anguished screams>"
"115740052-0-26765";"Vanish, comrades. I will deal with these heretics!"
"115740052-0-26766";"Feast! Drain them dry!"
"115740052-0-26767";"I've got this. Push the lever!"
"115740052-0-26768";"What a fabulous voyage we've shared, my friend! To Vvardenfell and new opportunities!"
"115740052-0-26769";"Still reading that letter? A lover's note, hmm?"
"115740052-0-26770";"Ah, you made it. Good. Have a look at this atronach. You ever seen a light like this?"
"115740052-0-26771";"What the—they're everywhere! Cut them down!"
"115740052-0-26772";"Nice work. I can't believe I didn't see them. I guess we keep to the light, yeah?"
"115740052-0-26773";"Now, let's find Tsatva and his new sweetheart, Velidreth. Time to end this."
"115740052-0-26774";"No need to confirm or deny it. We all have our secrets."
"115740052-0-26775";"I wonder what Vvardenfell has in store for us!"
"115740052-0-26776";"Jagged rocks ahead! Brace yourselves!"
"115740052-0-26777";"Well, that doesn't sound good."
"115740052-0-26778";"Hist bless you!"
"115740052-0-26779";"I am fine. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-26780";"I thought I was done for. Thank you."
"115740052-0-26781";"May the sun warm your scales, friend."
"115740052-0-26782";"By Sithis … that was too close."
"115740052-0-26783";"I'm … I'm alive? Thank you, friend. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-26784";"This one's still alive, Naryu!"
"115740052-0-26787";"Hit me. I want to see what you've got."
"115740052-0-26788";"Quick, defend yourself!"
"115740052-0-26789";"Nice! Now follow it up!"
"115740052-0-26790";"Try to stop this!"
"115740052-0-26791";"Finish her off!"
"115740052-0-26792";"Well done! Come, join us at the bonfire. Warm your freezing bones!"
"115740052-0-26793";"Over here! Get on board and let's go."
"115740052-0-26808";"We need to reach the spawning pools and slay the progenitor mantikora. Once the creature is killed, the Scaled Court won't be able to create more of these monsters. And if any of their prisoners are still alive, we should set them free."
"115740052-0-26821";"There. That should be sufficient. Now, take that writ and be off. I have a relic to study."
"115740052-0-26829";"Mine! Mine! Hee hee! Uh oh."
"115740052-0-26830";"Hey! What are you doing? Stop!"
"115740052-0-26831";"Thanks for chasing off the last of the Goblins. Horrible, smelly little creatures!"
"115740052-0-26832";"My brave protector. No sword, no pants, and absolutely no help whatsoever. If not for my stillness spell, you'd be half-way to Gnisis by now."
"115740052-0-26833";"Set me free and return my sword, witch!"
"115740052-0-26834";"That sword is payment for escorting me to Vivec City. We're not there yet, you ungrateful oaf!"
"115740052-0-26835";"Vivec City? I don't want anything more to do with you and your … your witchy ways!"
"115740052-0-26836";"I'll set you free, but you will live up to our agreement. And you'll do so sober—no more mead for you until we reach Vivec City."
"115740052-0-26837";"Stop that! I … yark!"
"115740052-0-26838";"Begin! The warlord approaches!"
"115740052-0-26839";"Quickly, to me. The warlord prepares to strike!"
"115740052-0-26841";"You've done well, girl. Do come by in a day or so. I may have some work for you."
"115740052-0-26848";"<door unlocking noise>"
"115740052-0-26849";"Come down from there, slave. Unless you'd prefer to lose some fingers."
"115740052-0-26850";"No! You will not put me in chains again! No one will!"
"115740052-0-26852";"Ha! Let the beast bleed. A slow death is all he deserves."
"115740052-0-26853";"We'll deal with the problem as promised, Lord Thanlen. But we need to hire protection if the ruin is as infested as you say."
"115740052-0-26854";"If only all spirits could be dealt with by simply slashing away at them."
"115740052-0-26855";"I would employ ghost hunters who can't hunt ghosts. Bah! Just find your help and get to work before I change my mind."
"115740052-0-26859";"I'm sorry, Tilenra, but my wife insists we try a real mage."
"115740052-0-26860";"Not you too? This is ridiculous!"
"115740052-0-26864";"That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
"115740052-0-26865";"You there! You've been selected for a random search! Come here at once!"
"115740052-0-26866";"Follow me, quietly, away from the gates. We have a judge in common."
"115740052-0-26867";"This'll do. Just keep your voice down."
"115740052-0-26868";"Meet me near Menaldinion's house and we'll put my plan into action."
"115740052-0-26878";"What's going on out here?"
"115740052-0-26879";"Impossible. It can't be! We broke your legs!"
"115740052-0-26880";"Ha! It seems I hunt bigger game today!"
"115740052-0-26881";"The Judge? No! You won't put me in prison!"
"115740052-0-26882";"Think you can smear my honor? I'll have your head!"
"115740052-0-26884";"You'll never take me alive!"
"115740052-0-26885";"These delays are unacceptable. How could you be so clumsy?"
"115740052-0-26886";"With respect, I wasn't the one who left an incriminating note on my dresser, Rilasi."
"115740052-0-26887";"This bickering accomplishes nothing. The Scarlet Judge is in prison, yes? The issue is well in hand."
"115740052-0-26888";"You are mistaken. One of my informants saw the Judge prowling the streets just this morning!"
"115740052-0-26889";"Mauloch's jawbone. You said you captured him! You said you broke his legs."
"115740052-0-26890";"What if he's not really a mer? What if he's a vampire?"
"115740052-0-26891";"He's not a vampire. Stop sniveling."
"115740052-0-26892";"Enough! I've dealt with the Judge. Your informants are wrong. Let's move on to more pressing issues, like how we move forward."
"115740052-0-26893";"Not so loud! That creature in the next chamber is a tricky one."
"115740052-0-26894";"What's this? They've found us! Run!"
"115740052-0-26896";"The summoning chamber! I'll call forth my ancestor, then you can ask Vivec's questions."
"115740052-0-26897";"Hasn't my rest been disturbed enough by those filthy Daedra? Why do you summon me, descendent?"
"115740052-0-26898";"My Lord Vivec has inquiries that only you can answer, my lady. My companion will present them, with your permission."
"115740052-0-26901";"You must be my new apprentice! Well, let's start the lesson, shall we?"
"115740052-0-26902";"I knew there was nothing to worry about."
"115740052-0-26903";"Lord Vivec, we don't need the help of this … outlander."
"115740052-0-26904";"Oh hush, Archcanon Tarvus. Outlanders have their usefulness and this one intrigues me."
"115740052-0-26905";"I demand to see my brother. Lay hands upon me and you will lose them!"
"115740052-0-26906";"As you say. I'll be in my office if you need me."
"115740052-0-26907";"Step forward, friend of Llevule, and let us speak."
"115740052-0-26908";"You there! The territory of the Red Exiles shouldn't be traveled lightly."
"115740052-0-26909";"Thank you! I need to get away from those Red Exiles. Meet me over here."
"115740052-0-26910";"This isn't what I expected. It's rather … small."
"115740052-0-26912";"Hope you packed a handkerchief, you smarmy bastard."
"115740052-0-26913";"Must we talk in circles?"
"115740052-0-26914";"You're still bickering."
"115740052-0-26915";"Please. The matter at hand?"
"115740052-0-26916";"There is no common ground?"
"115740052-0-26917";"Yet we must decide what to eat."
"115740052-0-26918";"Don't evade the matter."
"115740052-0-26919";"Like children, you mean?"
"115740052-0-26920";"You know my position."
"115740052-0-26921";"Not without concessions."
"115740052-0-26922";"I voted for pork."
"115740052-0-26923";"You're one to talk."
"115740052-0-26924";"You're the one to say it."
"115740052-0-26925";"And you know mine."
"115740052-0-26926";"Yet you refuse to concede."
"115740052-0-26927";"And I voted for ash yams."
"115740052-0-26928";"Snooping, ay? Why I have half a mind to …. Cats? Aghhh!"
"115740052-0-26929";"This is the person who helped me at the tomb, my lord."
"115740052-0-26930";"Hear the words of the Warrior-Poet and reveal the source of Lord Vivec's distress!"
"115740052-0-26932";"This is it! I've succeeded where all others have failed! I need more power! More power!"
"115740052-0-26933";"Keep it up! We're on the right track. This will change everything."
"115740052-0-26934";"We've done it. I feel the connection. The things we will learn will—"
"115740052-0-26935";"No. It can't be. Run! Run now!"
"115740052-0-26936";"Caught in the act! You have much to answer for!"
"115740052-0-26943";"The Warrior-Poet? Very well, ask Vivec's questions."
"115740052-0-26944";"If you're a good little guar, I'll remove the spell when we get to Vivec City. Maybe even buy you a new pair of pants."
"115740052-0-26945";"Thank the Three. I thought these wretched creatures would devour me!"
"115740052-0-26946";"I'm alive. I'm alive! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-26947";"Ugh, free? You … have my thanks, outlander."
"115740052-0-26948";"You hear it don't you? But it's not as it should be … not at all."
"115740052-0-26949";"I hope that's what Lord Vivec needed. Let's talk outside."
"115740052-0-26950";"Tilenra, I wish to thank you for that … most efficacious tea."
"115740052-0-26951";"And?"
"115740052-0-26952";"Your alchemical skills yield impressive results."
"115740052-0-26953";"And?"
"115740052-0-26954";"It was rude of me to malign your alchemical practice. I … apologize."
"115740052-0-26955";"Menaldinion, I forgive you. There's no reason for us to be at odds. We should try to cooperate, yes?"
"115740052-0-26956";"Yes. Agreed. So, now that we're on good terms, can you please shoo these horrid creatures away from my clinic?"
"115740052-0-26957";"Of course. I brewed just the thing."
"115740052-0-26958";"It's not time yet. It should be quiet. It should be sleeping. Damned groundquakes … must have been. Must have been!"
"115740052-0-26959";"About time someone showed up. Thought I'd die here under a pile of kwama."
"115740052-0-26960";"About time someone showed up … have we met before? Yes! You're the one who caught that rat, Tervur!"
"115740052-0-26961";"Be seeing you, partner. Farewell."
"115740052-0-26962";"Now lead on, my stalwart companion! This tomb won't explore itself."
"115740052-0-26964";"Something interfered with the ritual, my lord. But we may have learned something. Excuse me while I compare the results to our previous research …."
"115740052-0-26967";"Hmm, let me see. This squiggle means ""tomb"" …."
"115740052-0-26972";"Oh, wait!  That's ""V,"" not ""D."""
"115740052-0-26973";"Veloth tomb! Ooh, what's this button do?"
"115740052-0-26975";"Deal with that, will you? Then talk to Elfbetta outside!"
"115740052-0-26976";"Careful! The creatures attacked as soon as we entered the Hall of Remembrance."
"115740052-0-26977";"This used to be such a peaceful place. I came here as a young acolyte to meditate."
"115740052-0-26978";"We're nearly there! Then we can summon my ancestor."
"115740052-0-26979";"Legend has it that the Dwemer left Rkugamz centuries before they themselves vanished from Tamriel. They embarked on an exodus from the city when the Aedra supposedly cursed their masterwork, the Great Engine. If I'm correct, this explains much."
"115740052-0-26980";"I think the Engine is the cause of what we've witnessed here."
"115740052-0-26982";"We have to find the Engine. If we disable it, the ruins will be safe to explore."
"115740052-0-26984";"What did I ever do to that Netch?"
"115740052-0-26995";"Please! This one needs to get out of here! Those cultists, they're insane!"
"115740052-0-26996";"All right, but keep your voice down! I'll be ready to leave soon enough. In the meantime, if anyone asks, you're just here to haul cargo."
"115740052-0-26999";"Hello? Is someone out there? I seem to have locked myself in!"
"115740052-0-27001";"Ooh! This might be Veloth's long sought after right pauldron!"
"115740052-0-27002";"A good start. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-27003";"Correct! So far, so good!"
"115740052-0-27004";"Like clockwork, you are!"
"115740052-0-27005";"Close! Very close! One more to go!"
"115740052-0-27006";"Yes! I love it when the gears align!"
"115740052-0-27008";"Remarkable hanging. Early Second Era perhaps?"
"115740052-0-27009";"Outlander! Over here!"
"115740052-0-27010";"This requires a considerable amount of effort, so just listen."
"115740052-0-27011";"We have a … problem here. Return to my office immediately."
"115740052-0-27012";"Now, this is a burial chamber! We just need to find the entrance to the hidden passages."
"115740052-0-27013";"I doubt there's anything related to Saint Veloth in this chamber."
"115740052-0-27014";"Still, the inscription on that pedestal might reveal something. Do give it a look, apprentice."
"115740052-0-27015";"Somebody help me—do hurry! Make haste! It's me that these filthy creatures want to taste!"
"115740052-0-27016";"Hark! A great hero has come to my aid! I just hope that they don't expect to be paid!"
"115740052-0-27017";"Meet me near Dragonstar after you deal with the wamasu. Its den is close by."
"115740052-0-27018";"I hope you know what you're doing, Revus."
"115740052-0-27019";"Remember what I told you, Vigard. The sound of your voice should help soothe the queen. Just sing from the heart."
"115740052-0-27020";"I will, Revus. Settle in everyone. I've written a song for just this occasion. I think you'll enjoy it."
"115740052-0-27021";"Oh kwama, sweet kwama, Don't you want to be a momma …?"
"115740052-0-27022";"My lord! Please! Let me send for aid. Perhaps one of the healers can help you."
"115740052-0-27023";"""Pain is best tolerated in private,"" as I have written in the Thirty-Seventh Ballad."
"115740052-0-27024";"There must be something I can do."
"115740052-0-27025";"You can call the Archcanon. He should hear the news our friend brings us."
"115740052-0-27026";"Yes, my lord. Right away."
"115740052-0-27027";"Perhaps that dusty old tome will suggest suitable offerings. Dust makes me sneeze, so you should take a look."
"115740052-0-27028";"We did it! On to the Undertomb, apprentice!"
"115740052-0-27029";"No dawdling, apprentice! There's treasure nearby, I can practically smell it!"
"115740052-0-27030";"It's so… beautiful."
"115740052-0-27032";"Watch for traps! I hoped they'd kill it, not us."
"115740052-0-27033";"I thought I'd never see the sky again. Thank the Three! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-27034";"You are going the wrong way. Stale tracks are of no use."
"115740052-0-27035";"Return when you are committed to this hunt."
"115740052-0-27036";"Ah, the last piece of the puzzle. Time to tie up loose ends!"
"115740052-0-27037";"You! How did you—? Bah! I'll finish this myself!"
"115740052-0-27038";"There are many tracks here. Look! Above!"
"115740052-0-27039";"Why does it hesitate? Do we scare you ""Ruddy Man""?"
"115740052-0-27040";"It flees. It wants no part of prey that can wound it."
"115740052-0-27042";"Keep your eyes peeled for traps, apprentice!"
"115740052-0-27043";"The glass mine is not far. Lead on."
"115740052-0-27046";"Loyal to the end, Reynis. The world will mourn the loss of your wisdom!"
"115740052-0-27047";"Tanasa, my strength. Never did you yield, and so never shall I!"
"115740052-0-27048";"Beleth! You were like my own shadow, my will made manifest. My burdens are my own now."
"115740052-0-27049";"Tanisa! What's wrong? Someone, help!"
"115740052-0-27050";"By the Three! First a wounded Armiger, now this!"
"115740052-0-27051";"Ah! The main chamber must be down these stairs!"
"115740052-0-27052";"By dawn and dusk, evil creeps through the shadows of my beloved Vvardenfell! But an outlander arrives to aid my people, just as I have foreseen."
"115740052-0-27053";"Those words, what do they mean?"
"115740052-0-27054";"What … what happened?"
"115740052-0-27055";"Merciful Azura! The Mother Soul spoke through you. It's a miracle!"
"115740052-0-27056";"I'm sure you can handle this!"
"115740052-0-27066";"Water swirling, now arise. Be my hated foe's demise!"
"115740052-0-27067";"An ornate coffer! I'll take a look while you deal with any other issues that may arise."
"115740052-0-27069";"Hmm. Nothing important in there."
"115740052-0-27072";"It's so nice to have visitors. And so many. Who shall be my favorite, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-27075";"Now aren't you an interesting pair. More lively than the other ones. More vital. I look forward to wearing your skin."
"115740052-0-27079";"Such a pretty, hopeful smile. I'll have to practice it."
"115740052-0-27080";"Well, that's not something you see every day. Great opportunity for you to impress me, though."
"115740052-0-27081";"I believe I see the treasure vault on the other side of this chamber!"
"115740052-0-27082";"Away, foul creatures!"
"115740052-0-27083";"The Bracelet of Indrel Veloth, I'm sure of it!"
"115740052-0-27084";"I found a jeweled glove and a sturdy key! Let's see if it opens the way into the next section of the tomb."
"115740052-0-27085";"You deal with this. I wouldn't want to deny you a chance to demonstrate your impressive combat prowess."
"115740052-0-27088";"The Wise Woman … I was hoping she'd be here."
"115740052-0-27089";"You're too late, dear sister. Despite your protestations, the Wise Woman has gone to the Cave of the Incarnate to confirm my claim."
"115740052-0-27092";"My righteous friend, what are you doing with your hands?"
"115740052-0-27093";"It intimidates the ghosts when I stand like this. It tricks them into believing that I'm the one wielding this power."
"115740052-0-27094";"You look like an idiot."
"115740052-0-27095";"Begone, evil spirits! Begone! Oh, hey … it worked."
"115740052-0-27096";"So many spirits! Why they prefer tombs like this is beyond me!"
"115740052-0-27098";"Thank you for aiding me. But I sense you came for a different purpose. Let's talk inside the cavern."
"115740052-0-27099";"An outlander? Surely, there must be another way. No, my lady. Of course not. I'll do as you ask."
"115740052-0-27100";"Apprentice, you missed a few!"
"115740052-0-27101";"Come here, outlander. We must talk."
"115740052-0-27102";"Tiles set in the floor. I've seen this before."
"115740052-0-27103";"Come to Narsis, you beautiful golden head, you!"
"115740052-0-27104";"Well, this isn't at all what I expected."
"115740052-0-27105";"This place is ancient. These must be Veloth's earliest ancestors."
"115740052-0-27106";"I'll perform a thorough historical examination while you … deal with any inconveniences that happen our way."
"115740052-0-27108";"I expected your technique to be a little more graceful than that."
"115740052-0-27109";"Oh dear, I don't like the look of this. I'm sure you can manage."
"115740052-0-27110";"Ancient stairs! Those often lead to ancient treasures!"
"115740052-0-27111";"We need knowledge to defeat Chodala, outlander. Listen well to what the Failed Incarnates have to say."
"115740052-0-27112";"Mortal, let us speak."
"115740052-0-27114";"Did you see that flash of gold? A blessing from Saint Veloth for sure!"
"115740052-0-27115";"I wouldn't touch that if I were you."
"115740052-0-27116";"One moment."
"115740052-0-27117";"One down."
"115740052-0-27118";"And the other. All yours."
"115740052-0-27119";"Let's hope that rod still works, because otherwise, this will get really tedious."
"115740052-0-27120";"I think you're right, apprentice. There's no water down there. And I definitely see a gleam of gold!"
"115740052-0-27121";"This is disappointing. Where's all the treasure?"
"115740052-0-27122";"Nothing but some broken crates and an old well!"
"115740052-0-27123";"Narsis Dren never fails like this. I blame you, apprentice!"
"115740052-0-27124";"Patient? The foreman just dragged another egg-hand out of the mine and he's worse than the rest! This is on your head, Mobaner!"
"115740052-0-27125";"For the eightieth time, help is on the way! I've received assurances from House Redoran. They will handle this trouble in the mine. You need only be patient!"
"115740052-0-27126";"Hey!"
"115740052-0-27129";"I assume that was a mistake on your part!"
"115740052-0-27130";"I reiterate my earlier observation. You're a terrible apprentice!"
"115740052-0-27131";"Hello? Is anyone there? A little help please?"
"115740052-0-27132";"Wise Mothers, I apologize for my haste earlier. I was simply desperate to reunite with my ancestors."
"115740052-0-27133";"That spear. I sense  … where did you come by it?"
"115740052-0-27134";"Our mutual friend found it in my family's tomb. It belonged to my ancestor, Dranoth Hleran."
"115740052-0-27135";"Dranoth? Wise One, isn't that …?"
"115740052-0-27136";"Yes. The Unsung. Wiped from our history when he led his kin away from the Velothi path."
"115740052-0-27137";"You know him then? Dranoth battled Skar alongside your people, didn't he? He used this spear to fell the beast."
"115740052-0-27138";"Yes. Dranoth's kin—your kin—were once clanfriends. When Dranoth left the path, our Ashkhans slaughtered him, and his people. A sin that still haunts us. We rarely speak of it."
"115740052-0-27139";"Perhaps we can make amends. I have no quarrel with the tribes, but my ancestors have claim here. Ald'ruhn was … is our home."
"115740052-0-27140";"Absolutely not! The Houses claim our land, our livelihoods. They will not take Skar from us as well."
"115740052-0-27141";"Farseer, I have no desire to displace anyone. I will welcome the Velothi people to my table. Your pilgrimages, your cairns, your celebrations—all will remain as it is. You have my word."
"115740052-0-27142";"The sins of your Great Houses do not wash away the Unsung's claim. The Velothi people honor the past, even when it is inconvenient. Settle here if you wish, son of Dranoth. I only pray that Skar is big enough for both of us."
"115740052-0-27143";"Thank you, Wise One. You honor me and my ancestors. I vow to show your people equal respect."
"115740052-0-27146";"Can't you hear it? The song? It's all wrong! We have to … we have to fix it!"
"115740052-0-27148";"Bah! Fresh air's not going to do the trick, boss. Whatever's down there has still got a grip on him."
"115740052-0-27154";"Come, Vimy! To battle!"
"115740052-0-27155";"Stay behind me, you idiot!"
"115740052-0-27156";"Bah. Good riddance to bad scholars. Onward, to the prism!"
"115740052-0-27157";"Thank the moon and star, you've returned!"
"115740052-0-27158";"Must we continue this farce? It's obvious that I'm the Nerevarine."
"115740052-0-27159";"Someone has stepped forward to challenge your claim, Chodala."
"115740052-0-27160";"Seryn? I'm disappointed in you, dear sister."
"115740052-0-27161";"Enough! I shall hear your arguments and render my decision."
"115740052-0-27162";"Even the outlander can see that I'm the most powerful Ashkhan. My strength alone proves I am the Nerevarine!"
"115740052-0-27163";"As a warrior and as an Ashkhan, I was the most powerful of my age. But for all my strength, I failed my people. Don't follow my example!"
"115740052-0-27164";"The faithless Houses dare to threaten our land. But we shall meet them in battle and I will lead us to victory!"
"115740052-0-27165";"I thought the path to the Nerevarine was a path of blood and battle, but my love of war was my undoing. War is not the way."
"115740052-0-27166";"These Failed Incarnates prove nothing! I need no counsel but my own, as befits my status as the Nerevarine!"
"115740052-0-27167";"The queen is dead. Dead and gone, just like the rest. The song made it happen. Made them do it."
"115740052-0-27168";"I refused to accept the counsel of the Wise Women and the Ashkhans. I thought I knew best, but I knew nothing. That is not the way of the Nerevarine."
"115740052-0-27169";"This proves nothing! Look how the staff protects me! I am the Nerevarine! Red Exiles, slay the unbelievers!"
"115740052-0-27171";"Brother, no!"
"115740052-0-27172";"I hate what my brother's become."
"115740052-0-27173";"Argh! I really thought I had it that time. Curse you, you buzzing hunk of junk! This is spite, isn't it? I'm sorry I broke you, all right?"
"115740052-0-27174";"I should never have touched this damned thing. Stupid Revus. Just have to tinker with everything, don't you? Ugh."
"115740052-0-27177";"Malur Rethan … what a s'wit. I'm going to need a stiffer drink."
"115740052-0-27179";"This spider won't give me its treasure, dear brother."
"115740052-0-27180";"Allow me, my sister. This should open the miserable construct like a ripe fruit."
"115740052-0-27181";"Well, that didn't work. But keep trying! There are only one thousand twenty-four possible combinations, after all. We'll have it in no time!"
"115740052-0-27182";"Something's happening … I think you got it!"
"115740052-0-27183";"Yes, that's it! It's working! I hope!"
"115740052-0-27186";"Another one missing? By the Three, how many eggs did they take?"
"115740052-0-27187";"Ah, sweet freedom! Onward!"
"115740052-0-27188";"Halt, outsider. You bear our crest, but your blood runs dry as ash. You are no Hleran."
"115740052-0-27189";"If you come as a friend, prove your intent. Pay homage or join us in death."
"115740052-0-27190";"We were nomads once. It was Saint Veloth's doing. He taught our hearts to wander. In those days, the First Ashkhans called me brother."
"115740052-0-27191";"We gave our hearts to the ash … to the mountains. We linked arms with the other tribes and hunted the great Skar. With my spear, I struck the final blow. All of Veloth's children embraced in triumph. Then everything changed."
"115740052-0-27193";"After Skar fell, my people cried out for the quiet life with crops and strong houses. We silenced our Velothi hearts and settled beside the fire river. Skar provided with chitin and meat. We thrived."
"115740052-0-27194";"There was peace, for a time. Then bloodshed."
"115740052-0-27195";"The First Ashkhans grew old and died. New Ashkhans took their place, with souls dark as pitch. They painted their faces and slaughtered us. With our home and history lost, the last of the Hlerans left the Wastes in silence."
"115740052-0-27196";"I'm sorry for the delay. Getting the eggs down here was trickier than I'd thought. Greetings, Foreman."
"115740052-0-27197";"Enough with the apologies, Revus. Our mutual friend told me everything. Where are these egg-heaps?"
"115740052-0-27198";"Oh. Yes, I've put them down by the dock. Should make the clean up a bit less onerous. Feel free to go down there and inspect them. I just need a moment before we begin."
"115740052-0-27199";"This better work. We've got a lot riding on this. So do you."
"115740052-0-27200";"And look, another passage opens! That will lead to the treasure vault, most assuredly!"
"115740052-0-27201";"Aim for vital parts! They have to have vital parts!"
"115740052-0-27202";"There you are! Are you a party to this ridiculous plan?"
"115740052-0-27204";"Something's happening! I think it's—oh no! What is that?"
"115740052-0-27205";"Oh no. Something's wrong! Everyone, run!"
"115740052-0-27206";"That was your last chance, Revus. To Sovngarde with you and your schemes!"
"115740052-0-27207";"Finally, your treachery is revealed. Don't try to run, Telvanni scum. Your House will know of your part in this."
"115740052-0-27208";"Thank goodness you're here. We have to hurry!"
"115740052-0-27209";"Damn it, Manore! Are these Redoran oathmen ever going to arrive? Where are they?"
"115740052-0-27210";"They'll be here soon! The chance to punish this treacherous Telvanni is too good to pass up. House Redoran is going to to make your House pay dearly, Revus."
"115740052-0-27211";"I'd temper your expectations. I am Telvanni, true, but my relationship with the council is distant at best. I doubt it will mean as much as you think."
"115740052-0-27212";"Revus, our friend here told me what you did. I'm still madder than a shaved cave bear, but you're free to go."
"115740052-0-27213";"What?"
"115740052-0-27214";"Excuse me?"
"115740052-0-27215";"You got us a queen. Don't get me wrong, I don't want you mending my clothes or making my food—I'd probably wind up naked and poisoned. But you did what you said you'd do. That's good enough for me."
"115740052-0-27216";"Have you lost your mind? This miscreant can't be allowed to leave! House Redoran will hear of this! I'll report you too! I'll report this whole fetching town!"
"115740052-0-27217";"Ugh. I'd be worried if I thought Manore's word counted for anything. Stay out of trouble, Revus. I mean it."
"115740052-0-27218";"Well, I certainly didn't expect that …."
"115740052-0-27219";"Follow me, but keep an eye out for those Daedra!"
"115740052-0-27220";"Have you only just arrived or is this you returning? I can't always keep the cogs and pistons in line."
"115740052-0-27221";"My patience now is at its end!"
"115740052-0-27222";"You've paid your respects and listened, even as my family tries to kill you. Your heart is pure. Come, find me in my tomb. I will speak with you there."
"115740052-0-27223";"Your presence defiles this city, Ashlander. How dare you demand to see our god?"
"115740052-0-27224";"I'm here to help. If you won't listen to me, listen to the outlander!"
"115740052-0-27225";"Thank the Three, the outlander has returned. Was Barilzar able to help us?"
"115740052-0-27226";"Over there! Those Red Exiles—they've been slaughtered!"
"115740052-0-27227";"These creatures … they don't belong to Malacath. Another prince's power is at work here."
"115740052-0-27228";"I'll give this to the council."
"115740052-0-27229";"My hands are shaking. Stay close, all right?"
"115740052-0-27230";"Perfect! It's working just as I expected!"
"115740052-0-27231";"What are you doing? It's killing him!"
"115740052-0-27232";"What did you expect? That's the point of all this, after all!"
"115740052-0-27233";"I've powered up the tonal inverter! Activate the wave!"
"115740052-0-27234";"You're too late! I see it now, the Clockwork City! Look what Barbas found for you, Master!"
"115740052-0-27237";"Agh! The matriarch is coming! Be careful! I'll run straight back to Vos!"
"115740052-0-27238";"What … what happened? Come on, let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-27239";"Ha! See? Everything worked out. I have a small camp set outside of this room. We can talk there."
"115740052-0-27240";"Hey! Over here!"
"115740052-0-27241";"I knew that Telvanni would betray us eventually! We should have cast him out years ago!"
"115740052-0-27242";"Until your House shows up, we have no other options. I'm willing to give anything a try at this point."
"115740052-0-27243";"You'd welcome that Telvanni schemer into town after all he's done? You truly are a fool, Lathdar. To Oblivion with the lot of you!"
"115740052-0-27244";"Mortal, I would have words with you."
"115740052-0-27245";"Here's the deed, Lady Jinrisa."
"115740052-0-27247";"Ah, Vimy, I see you're still alive. Excellent."
"115740052-0-27248";"What are you doing in here? Didn't I just get you out?"
"115740052-0-27249";"I will not have Lenarmen stealing my prize. With our friend here, I have nothing to fear."
"115740052-0-27250";"All this optimism. Wow. No offense, friend."
"115740052-0-27251";"I know secret paths through the ruins. We will shadow our intrepid assistant, and help as opportunities present themselves."
"115740052-0-27252";"Easy does it. You're safe now."
"115740052-0-27253";"Oh, you're a life saver! Literally! Watch for steam vents up ahead. They always hiss before they fire, all right?"
"115740052-0-27255";"Good luck. I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-27256";"You came after me? You're getting as bad as mother. I'm not a child!"
"115740052-0-27258";"She won't refuse my claim. Just in case, make sure the Red Exiles are ready."
"115740052-0-27259";"Your word is law, Nerevarine."
"115740052-0-27260";"Whoever you are, thank you. Lenarmen went deeper into the ruin. You can catch him if you hurry!"
"115740052-0-27261";"I have to get back to the expedition. Don't go easy on these brutes, all right?"
"115740052-0-27262";"Ruptga's starry breeches! I was beginning to lose hope. Lenarmen's ahead—still struggling with Neramo's control rod."
"115740052-0-27263";"I think I can make it back on my own. Be careful down here, friend!"
"115740052-0-27264";"The staff protects him. You can't hurt him until we use the tonal inverter."
"115740052-0-27265";"You can't harm me! I have a powerful patron on my side!"
"115740052-0-27266";"Well, if it isn't my favorite loose end. Time to tie it off."
"115740052-0-27267";"Believe me, I'd rather be bagging our crop, but you know how your mother is. She won't give me a moment's peace."
"115740052-0-27268";"Let us begin, shall we?"
"115740052-0-27269";"This should do. Now, off with you. My friends and I have pressing business. So much to do!"
"115740052-0-27270";"We will review the request soon. In the meantime, continue your studies."
"115740052-0-27271";"Muthsera Suth is most kind. I thank you."
"115740052-0-27272";"Always, she is busy and in a hurry."
"115740052-0-27273";"My lord, the outlander may have actually discovered something!"
"115740052-0-27276";"One tonal inverter, coming up! Connect this … tighten the spring …"
"115740052-0-27277";"Get this letter to Drevis! It's important! Just don't let House Redoran get their hands on it."
"115740052-0-27278";"You won't get this note!"
"115740052-0-27279";"Ah, what a pleasant surprise. Stay a while, won't you?"
"115740052-0-27280";"Thank you, my friend. Be careful."
"115740052-0-27281";"The girl you came to save never existed! Her false life is cast off, she has embraced her destiny!"
"115740052-0-27282";"Nevena! They've come for you. They want to take you away from here. Is that what you want?"
"115740052-0-27283";"I'll die before I go back to those traitors! I belong here! This is my birthright!"
"115740052-0-27284";"Shiralas, where are you? It's too dangerous!"
"115740052-0-27285";"Oh, Gilan, look! A Dwemer gear. It's in remarkably good condition."
"115740052-0-27286";"Yes, wonderful, I'll mark it down."
"115740052-0-27287";"And here, another. Could these have fallen off the ruins?"
"115740052-0-27288";"Yes, ah … that is peculiar."
"115740052-0-27289";"Is something the matter, dear? You seem distracted today."
"115740052-0-27290";"Nothing's the matter! I'm just … I'm nervous."
"115740052-0-27291";"Whatever for? If anything attacks us, I'll protect you."
"115740052-0-27292";"I'm not nervous about an attack, Bravora! It's just … well … there's no good way to say this."
"115740052-0-27293";"To say what?"
"115740052-0-27294";"Marry me."
"115740052-0-27295";"Are you serious?"
"115740052-0-27296";"That's … not the response I hoped for."
"115740052-0-27297";"Gilan, of course I'll marry you! I love you. I just expected something more dramatic."
"115740052-0-27298";"Well, I planned to propose at the falls, but today we didn't go to the falls. I had to improvise."
"115740052-0-27299";"And this is why you've been so nervous?"
"115740052-0-27300";"Yes. Wait—did you just agree to marry me?"
"115740052-0-27301";"Yes, Gilan. A dozen times yes. My dear, distracted, adorable archivist, I will marry you."
"115740052-0-27302";"That's wonderful!"
"115740052-0-27303";"Isn't it?"
"115740052-0-27304";"Oh Bravora, you won't regret this. You are the stars to my sky."
"115740052-0-27305";"Did you just come up with that?"
"115740052-0-27306";"Well, ah, no. I've been saving it for the right time."
"115740052-0-27307";"Xykenaz! Duke of black covenants! Appear! By the seven stones of your dark Prince, you will parley with me!"
"115740052-0-27308";"Hmm … Dratha. Come to treat with another of Bal's servants? You will pay for this."
"115740052-0-27309";"Silence, Daedra! Bend and heed my words! I demand immortality. Name your price."
"115740052-0-27313";"Yes, price. There is no gift without cost, witch. I will grant your wish, but know this—you will live in endless fear, for on a day of my Master's choosing, I will come in the guise of a mortal man to claim your withered soul for Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-27315";"There you will face an eternity of anguish and drown forever in an icy sea of shame. Tell me, scion of Azura, do you accept my terms?"
"115740052-0-27317";"I accept."
"115740052-0-27318";"The covenant is made. Be seeing you, magister."
"115740052-0-27321";"My patron, Magister Gothren, opposes any further honors for the slave girl. Oh look, the lizard sent a representative. Such pretensions."
"115740052-0-27322";"Honestly, Ralasa …."
"115740052-0-27324";"Be sure to add that all further petitions will meet the same fate. Cats and lizards have no place in our Great House."
"115740052-0-27325";"Approach, emissary. You may inform your benefactress, Sun-in-Shadow, that the Council has elected to reject her petition."
"115740052-0-27326";"Stand still, you damned looter!"
"115740052-0-27327";"No one steals from Lord Vivec!"
"115740052-0-27328";"Don't worry, Ralasa. The emissary will give Sun-in-Shadow a full account of this meeting. I have no doubt."
"115740052-0-27329";"You've returned! It sounds like the city is falling apart out there, so there isn't much time!"
"115740052-0-27330";"Sweet energy … like a sip of water … for a thirsty man …."
"115740052-0-27332";"This place is fascinating! I wonder how long it has lain undisturbed?"
"115740052-0-27333";"It could be years. Decades, even!"
"115740052-0-27334";"I'd hoped to find more Dwemer relics, but I suppose the view is inspiring."
"115740052-0-27335";"It certainly is."
"115740052-0-27337";"Flatterer. You can see this view anywhere, now can't you?"
"115740052-0-27338";"And yet I never grow tired of looking."
"115740052-0-27339";"Speaking of looking … we should start viewing larger homes."
"115740052-0-27340";"What's wrong with our current home?"
"115740052-0-27341";"It's rather small, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-27342";"It's cozy! Just enough room for you and me."
"115740052-0-27343";"And you don't see how that could become a problem?"
"115740052-0-27344";"I, uh … no?"
"115740052-0-27345";"Well, you've done a lot more than look since we married, dear."
"115740052-0-27346";"At houses …? Wait—Bravora?"
"115740052-0-27347";"Yes?"
"115740052-0-27348";"You're pregnant?"
"115740052-0-27349";"That happens when one enjoys the view, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-27350";"That's wonderful! I'm going to be a father!"
"115740052-0-27351";"Yes, dear. Yes you are."
"115740052-0-27352";"We need a new house! With a real kitchen—and a second bedroom! Perhaps, even three bedrooms?"
"115740052-0-27353";"One step at a time, dear."
"115740052-0-27354";"Tel Aruhn's closed. So piss off, ya little scamp."
"115740052-0-27355";"Pssst! Come here, walker."
"115740052-0-27356";"Vehk's head … should have stopped at four drinks last night."
"115740052-0-27357";"Serjos! A fire burns on the docks! Slavemaster Arenim shouts many foul words! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-27358";"Dumac's blood. All right, come on!"
"115740052-0-27359";"Outlander, over here. I've been trying to find something that makes sense of all—"
"115740052-0-27360";"Mortal, the Lady of Twilight has words for you!"
"115740052-0-27361";"Arith, Giravel, I've had enough of your excuses. Ralasa made your task plain. Find those thieves!"
"115740052-0-27362";"I'm sorry, Magister. It will be done."
"115740052-0-27365";"Whatever it is you want, talk to my cringing assistant."
"115740052-0-27366";"Interesting. That shouldn't have happened. Now where in Oblivion am I?"
"115740052-0-27367";"Mage, this mortal speaks with the authority of the Mother Soul."
"115740052-0-27368";"You'll need my help. I know the city almost as well as Sotha Sil. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-27369";"Greetings, outlander. Sedura Ralasa sends her regards. Gathering up these slaves on our own would have been exhausting."
"115740052-0-27370";"Who are you? What do you want?"
"115740052-0-27371";"No, no, no."
"115740052-0-27372";"Damned cats. You lot are going back to Tel Aruhn. Move out!"
"115740052-0-27373";"You heard the captain. Get moving, cur!"
"115740052-0-27374";"Well done! This should help us determine what happened to Veya's brother."
"115740052-0-27375";"Oh look, it's the lizard's errand runner. Did she send you to kill me, I wonder?"
"115740052-0-27376";"Where to send her first. Hmm."
"115740052-0-27377";"Mmm, delicious. Powdered pearl-dust and sugar."
"115740052-0-27379";"Wha-? That bitch! Poison!"
"115740052-0-27380";"So, the lizard thinks she can kill me? Come on then!"
"115740052-0-27381";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-27382";"You have been a true friend. I do not forget such things."
"115740052-0-27383";"Open your eyes! Please, open your eyes!"
"115740052-0-27384";"Are they gone?"
"115740052-0-27385";"Yes! You fought them off."
"115740052-0-27386";"Oh good. Dying for nothing … would have been … embarrassing."
"115740052-0-27387";"You're not going to die. I won't allow it!"
"115740052-0-27388";"That's … ambitious of you."
"115740052-0-27389";"I can mend more than a scraped knee, you'll see. Just … don't move."
"115740052-0-27390";"Oh … that feels better."
"115740052-0-27391";"I told you …! You're still bleeding. Just a little more!"
"115740052-0-27392";"Gilan …."
"115740052-0-27393";"I can save you! I will save you!"
"115740052-0-27394";"Take care of the children. For me. Promise."
"115740052-0-27395";"We'll take care of them together."
"115740052-0-27396";"Promise me."
"115740052-0-27397";"I will, I promise! But—keep your eyes open!"
"115740052-0-27398";"I wish I could."
"115740052-0-27399";"Bravora!"
"115740052-0-27400";"You've made these years … so wonderful …."
"115740052-0-27401";"Bravora? Bravora!"
"115740052-0-27402";"That actually worked? Well, glad to see you're still alive, assistant!"
"115740052-0-27403";"Hurry, outlander. Vivec is nearly spent."
"115740052-0-27404";"Your wife signed a contract, Gilan. She did not complete it."
"115740052-0-27405";"But … she died."
"115740052-0-27406";"And now the crystals she was to procure for me have been acquired by my rival."
"115740052-0-27407";"I—I've lost the mother of my children!"
"115740052-0-27408";"Your failings are not my problem."
"115740052-0-27409";"We don't have enough money to pay you back."
"115740052-0-27410";"Then we will sell your house."
"115740052-0-27411";"We can't do that! Master, please! My children—"
"115740052-0-27412";"May purchase their own dwelling, with their own money."
"115740052-0-27413";"Neria's only just turned eight! And Mils …."
"115740052-0-27414";"You would offer an alternative?"
"115740052-0-27415";"What can I offer you?"
"115740052-0-27416";"I understand you have some aptitude for magic. You will serve me."
"115740052-0-27417";"But … my children …."
"115740052-0-27418";"Will remain in your home, so long as you do not violate our contract."
"115740052-0-27419";"But who will raise them? When will I see them?"
"115740052-0-27420";"You will see them when I don't need you. Or would you rather see them in the street?"
"115740052-0-27421";"No, of course not. Thank you, Master Drenim. I will serve you."
"115740052-0-27422";"You sign your contract today."
"115740052-0-27423";"Sera! A moment, please."
"115740052-0-27427";"Use Sunna'rah and … restore my energy …."
"115740052-0-27428";"Oh, do be careful!"
"115740052-0-27431";"You killed one of my gang, s'wit. No writ will protect you from us."
"115740052-0-27432";"Feeling left out? I'm sure I can procure a writ for each of you."
"115740052-0-27433";"That's it! Kill the Morag Tong and any witnesses!"
"115740052-0-27434";"Oh … scrib jelly. I'm too late."
"115740052-0-27435";"Meet me inside!"
"115740052-0-27436";"Chodala, we deny your claim. You are not the Nerevarine."
"115740052-0-27438";"You go on ahead. I'll wait here for a bit. Best we're not seen together. No offense."
"115740052-0-27439";"Father? Mils has come to visit."
"115740052-0-27441";"Father? Father!"
"115740052-0-27442";"Oh, Father. I suppose you are with mother at last."
"115740052-0-27443";"Couldn't resist disappointing me one last time … good riddance."
"115740052-0-27444";"Neria. Mils. I so regret not being there as you grew up. What I could never tell you is why my life was not my own."
"115740052-0-27445";"What? A ghost?"
"115740052-0-27446";"Sssh, Mils. I think this is a memory."
"115740052-0-27447";"Soon, I'll be able to share the truth with you. To share everything with you. Thanks to the efforts of this kind traveler, I have archived my memories on this stone."
"115740052-0-27449";"I hope one day … you will find it in your hearts to forgive me. And find the father, and mother, you never had here."
"115740052-0-27450";"Father …"
"115740052-0-27451";"I love you. I have always loved you. You've both made me so proud."
"115740052-0-27452";"Why? Why couldn't you just fade away like you always do? Why couldn't you just let me forget you?"
"115740052-0-27458";"Because it's not just about him, Mils, or you. It's about all of us. Our family, together at last."
"115740052-0-27476";"She's just one woman! Get inside the ruins and stop her!"
"115740052-0-27477";"Let the assassin come! I'm tired of running and she doesn't frighten me!"
"115740052-0-27478";"Come out, little assassin! Or is the Morag Tong too scared to meet the powerful Sneg face to face?"
"115740052-0-27479";"Good, you've returned to your senses. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-27480";"Come with me."
"115740052-0-27481";"Intruder in the hold! Someone put out that fire while I deal with this flea!"
"115740052-0-27482";"Nice! We make a great team. Now, let's get off this burning ship!"
"115740052-0-27483";"I can see that. Walk this way and let's make sure everything works after that dreadful shipwreck."
"115740052-0-27484";"Azura is my shield, you foul creatures!"
"115740052-0-27486";"The ship's under attack! Pretend you're part of the crew and maybe the slavers won't notice."
"115740052-0-27487";"Go below decks and use the fire bomb. I'll search for the Captain. Now move!"
"115740052-0-27489";"Ugh. Where am …? Oh, dear. Just give me a moment."
"115740052-0-27490";"There she is! Surround her! Cut her apart!"
"115740052-0-27491";"Really, Sneg. This only delays the inevitable."
"115740052-0-27492";"A helping hand? How sweet."
"115740052-0-27493";"Excuse me, hero. I have to see an Orc about a writ."
"115740052-0-27494";"The outlander will come through for us. I know it."
"115740052-0-27495";"Don't kill me! I didn't mean to interfere with House Telvanni's plans! I made a mistake!"
"115740052-0-27496";"A mistake? Well, that explains everything! I'll just let the Telvanni know. I'm sure Mage Vaelin will understand."
"115740052-0-27497";"Oh, that's a relief! I thought for sure you were going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-27498";"I am."
"115740052-0-27499";"Ugh, I hate when my leathers get wet! And this is a new outfit, too! Ah, well, I suppose we ought to discuss what you're doing here."
"115740052-0-27500";"Crazy machine, eh? Figured you'd find it quickly enough."
"115740052-0-27501";"Don't let some dwarven trap slice you up, eh?"
"115740052-0-27503";"Run! The mine's collaps—the kwama are—what is this thing? Never mind! Get out of here, through the east mine!"
"115740052-0-27507";"No one ever catches the Hound!"
"115740052-0-27510";"You didn't get yourself killed. That's promising."
"115740052-0-27511";"I am a free mage of House Telvanni. You had no right to imprison me!"
"115740052-0-27512";"You presume to lecture me? You who conspired to kill my servant?"
"115740052-0-27513";"Thank whatever scaly gods you worship that I didn't rend the flesh off your back and feed you to the tower's roots! Cross me again, and your life is forfeit."
"115740052-0-27514";"We're done here. Begone."
"115740052-0-27515";"Come to pluck the juicy worms from our nest. Yes, they have, Yes, they have."
"115740052-0-27516";"You return escaping Khajiit to that beast, Gothren, and now I hear about our egg-kin crushed in the Zalkin-Sul mine? I thought I understood you, but I do not."
"115740052-0-27519";"Eoki, wait! I'm trying to be strong enough for the both of us …."
"115740052-0-27520";"But the earth here's hungry. Yes, it is."
"115740052-0-27521";"Yes, Grand Forge-Mother."
"115740052-0-27522";"Help! Please, someone help me!"
"115740052-0-27523";"Thank you! I'll go tell the Overseer what you did for me."
"115740052-0-27525";"That's exactly why I'm here, Veya! I love you! I'm not going to leave you out here alone. Let me help you in this! I've already lied for you. I'll fight for you if I have to!"
"115740052-0-27527";"If… if that's what you want. I'm not… I'm not going to give up on you though."
"115740052-0-27528";"This stuff is good! Soooo-jamma. Sujamma!"
"115740052-0-27529";"So many stairs ….  Wait. I was supposed to do something."
"115740052-0-27530";"Uh, maybe you've had enough sujamma."
"115740052-0-27531";"How much has she had? Sujamma kicks like a bow-legged echatere. Let her sleep it off."
"115740052-0-27532";"Come on, Atarga. Aim for the stairs."
"115740052-0-27533";"Snatched the fat grubs from our hands. Yes, they have."
"115740052-0-27534";"I can't move! Help me!"
"115740052-0-27535";"I thought I was going to die under there! Thanks for saving me."
"115740052-0-27536";"Never they mind, they're at the earth's hungry mouth. Yes, they are."
"115740052-0-27537";"Veya, run! They're here!"
"115740052-0-27543";"I won't keep you."
"115740052-0-27544";"She can handle herself just fine, hero. Veya, grab your things. It's time to go."
"115740052-0-27545";"Go? Why? What's going on?"
"115740052-0-27546";"The Warclaws are marching toward this cave, along with half the House Redoran soldiers in Balmora. We need to go now."
"115740052-0-27547";"Damn it, they must have followed us! I'll get my stuff."
"115740052-0-27548";"There you are. I knew you would not abandon us."
"115740052-0-27549";"Sun-in-Shadow?"
"115740052-0-27550";"Eoki. The way we left things was …. Please, don't go."
"115740052-0-27551";"I must. You and I share a heart, but our souls chirr different songs. This cannot last."
"115740052-0-27552";"But before you go, you must see how your Telvanni treat our kin. Please, come into the mine and see how they live. How they die."
"115740052-0-27553";"Fine. I will do this for you, but then I must go."
"115740052-0-27554";"Eoki, be careful. We'll keep an eye out for any movement from Tel Aruhn."
"115740052-0-27555";"Brother, do you really want to pursue this dangerous course?"
"115740052-0-27556";"There was a time when you gave me your unconditional support, Seryn. I miss those days."
"115740052-0-27557";"Does the ceiling look unstable to you?"
"115740052-0-27558";"Search everywhere! Captain Brivan thinks the Councilor's kitten might try to escape through these tunnels."
"115740052-0-27559";"Damn! Those cat bastards are harder to shake than a blind date!"
"115740052-0-27560";"This looks promising. Let's give it a try."
"115740052-0-27563";"I can't get captured and taken back to my father, not when I'm this close to finding my brother."
"115740052-0-27564";"That must be the way out! I just hope there aren't any Redorans up there."
"115740052-0-27569";"Oh no, we're surrounded! And that's my father! What's he doing here?"
"115740052-0-27570";"Sweep the caves. If you spot Veya, report back to me. She's not to be harmed!"
"115740052-0-27571";"I prefer that you don't harm the agents I hired, either. There's no need for bloodshed."
"115740052-0-27572";"Halt! Who goes there?"
"115740052-0-27573";"Stand down. These Outlanders work for me."
"115740052-0-27574";"Do as I command and let them pass."
"115740052-0-27575";"The entrance is right this way—"
"115740052-0-27576";"Well, those certainly aren't Ashlanders, not with those tails!"
"115740052-0-27577";"This is … disturbing …."
"115740052-0-27578";"Veya, I don't think this is a good idea. We're trying to keep you out of House Redoran hands, remember?"
"115740052-0-27579";"You're not my parent, Naryu! I can take care of myself, even if ""the Mother of Blades"" doesn't think so."
"115740052-0-27580";"Damn it, Veya! You know I hate that title."
"115740052-0-27581";"We're just going to burn them? Even the Redoran?"
"115740052-0-27582";"The captain called them traitors and savages. Said a good roasting was more than they deserved."
"115740052-0-27583";"Intruders! Warclaws, attack!"
"115740052-0-27584";"Down here! Come on! Wait … what's that smell?"
"115740052-0-27585";"Veya, stay back. You don't need to see this."
"115740052-0-27586";"What happened here? Oh gods, they murdered these poor Ashlanders!"
"115740052-0-27587";"Oh no, Ulran!"
"115740052-0-27588";"Ulran! Wake up, please. You can't be dead! You just can't!"
"115740052-0-27589";"If you're listening to my voice, know that my time is short and what I have to say is important."
"115740052-0-27590";"Brother … is that you?"
"115740052-0-27591";"Everything that happened was a deliberate act to discredit me. I need to report the events so my sister can learn the truth about her brother."
"115740052-0-27592";"Ulran! Damn it, what am I supposed to do now?"
"115740052-0-27593";"Get out of here, Ashur! I don't need a nursemaid, no matter what Naryu might think!"
"115740052-0-27599";"Soldiers! To the ships! We sail for Firemoth Island!"
"115740052-0-27600";"Kill the slavers! Rescue the slaves!"
"115740052-0-27601";"The slavers' captives are secure!"
"115740052-0-27602";"No. <<1>>, I am placing you under arrest for promoting slavery in Pact territory."
"115740052-0-27603";"How dare you accuse me of such a thing! You have no proof!"
"115740052-0-27604";"A note on your parchment which led to the sabotage of the lighthouse and a shipwreck off our coast. A letter naming you as the slaver captain's partner. Do you deny your involvement?"
"115740052-0-27605";"That proves nothing! I'll have you hanged for this!"
"115740052-0-27606";"The document you requested, Deputy Governor."
"115740052-0-27607";"And your report to Vivec City claiming Firemoth Island to be free of slaver activity, written before we eradicated the slaver base."
"115740052-0-27608";"Delms! You can't believe these blatant lies about me!"
"115740052-0-27609";"My duty is clear, traitor."
"115740052-0-27610";"Secure him."
"115740052-0-27611";"Yes, Governor Salvi."
"115740052-0-27612";"Sergeant, where's <<1>>? What happened here?"
"115740052-0-27613";"The Governor struck me from behind and fled."
"115740052-0-27614";"The Governor seeks to escape justice! After him!"
"115740052-0-27615";"<<1>>! He's dead!"
"115740052-0-27616";"Murderer! <<1>> knew that you had a report claiming Firemoth Island was free of slavers, and we both know that was a lie."
"115740052-0-27617";"The Sergeant's dead? Who would do such a thing?"
"115740052-0-27618";"Yes, Governor Salvi."
"115740052-0-27619";"<<1>>! He's dead! When I came to inform the Governor, he ambushed me!"
"115740052-0-27620";"ALMSIVI is the ending of words. Stay quiet, picking the lock is enough noise."
"115740052-0-27621";"I saw you in chains. They said you burgled the Governor's quarters. I bet he's crooked, isn't he?"
"115740052-0-27622";"No time to talk. Everyone saw a distress signal and rushed off to Firemoth Island. That's where the heretics must be!"
"115740052-0-27623";"Go now! ALMSIVI is the ending of words!"
"115740052-0-27625";"The Patriarch needs more for the Forge. Round them up!"
"115740052-0-27627";"See what you can find pertaining to Ulran. I've got a dagger and a writ with Councilor Dolvara's name on them."
"115740052-0-27628";"You aren't clever enough or pretty enough to avoid what's about to happen, Dolvara."
"115740052-0-27629";"What's the meaning of this? Who are you people?"
"115740052-0-27630";"I'm a Morag Tong with a writ that says you're a criminal and a traitor. That means I get to end your miserable existence."
"115740052-0-27633";"What's this? I don't like uninvited guests."
"115740052-0-27634";"That's what you're wearing? All right, but it's your funeral."
"115740052-0-27636";"The Morag Tong issued the writ with your name on it. You do remember that House Redoran frowns upon slavery these days, yes?"
"115740052-0-27637";"Take another look around, hero, and see if you can find anything else related to Ulran."
"115740052-0-27639";"Alik'r massage oils? Fancy! But that has nothing to do with Ulran."
"115740052-0-27640";"More proof that Dolvara was in bed with both House Hlaalu and House Dres."
"115740052-0-27641";"That's Captain Brivan's seal. I suppose our evil councilor courted favor wherever she could find it."
"115740052-0-27643";"Father of Manbeasts! Huntsman of the Princes! Hircine, hear me!"
"115740052-0-27644";"We seek the blood of this timid herd!"
"115740052-0-27645";"We offer our quarry for your favor!"
"115740052-0-27646";"Bless our hunt with your hungry blades and you will forever feast on these swine!"
"115740052-0-27647";"Blood for blood. Feed the earth!"
"115740052-0-27648";"Well look at that! Naryu said I'd find you here and damn it all if she wasn't right."
"115740052-0-27649";"You are persistent, I'll give you that."
"115740052-0-27650";"Looks like you need more skaafin!"
"115740052-0-27651";"I can't let Lord Vivec down …."
"115740052-0-27652";"Those monsters! It's too dangerous. What am I going to do?"
"115740052-0-27654";"We have been betrayed! They are upon us!"
"115740052-0-27655";"My strength is measured in loyalty! Faithful, heed my call!"
"115740052-0-27657";"Should've given me that gold at the inn, runt!"
"115740052-0-27658";"Look, Master! Vivec's toy found a way through, just like you said!"
"115740052-0-27659";"But Barbas has Sunna'rah! What does Vivec's toy have?"
"115740052-0-27660";"Master, I'm close to our goal! With Vivec's energy, I can open a portal and …."
"115740052-0-27661";"Pray this works, my hound, for you interfered with a plan that wasn't intended for the likes of you."
"115740052-0-27662";"I'm so close, Master! Soon the secrets of Sotha Sil's city will be yours!"
"115740052-0-27663";"Get on with it, dog! Grant me access to the Clockwork City and I'll reward you a thousandfold!"
"115740052-0-27664";"Master, why do you bother with partners when you have such a faithful servant in me?"
"115740052-0-27665";"Questioning me, Barbas? Again? Have you learned nothing from your last banishment?"
"115740052-0-27667";"No! Toss those wretched things to the fire! It's over, don't you see?"
"115740052-0-27668";"By Azura's grace, this one is free! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-27669";"This one gazed into the void and saw a terrible vision, walker. A great beast, with three heads upon a single neck!"
"115740052-0-27670";"Kanzin must know more. You will find this one at Pariah Abbey, yes? Please, hurry!"
"115740052-0-27671";"I'll check on her again in the morning. For now, just get some rest, ay? You look awful."
"115740052-0-27672";"Yes … thank you, Menwendel. And please, let me know straight away if you make any progress on a cure."
"115740052-0-27673";"Of course. And I meant what I said. Sleep, Llayne."
"115740052-0-27674";"Yes, yes …. And who might you be?"
"115740052-0-27675";"Cut them free! And find them proper blades. There's more Reach-dogs where these came from!"
"115740052-0-27677";"Freedom, at last! I don't know how much longer I could have survived …."
"115740052-0-27678";"I saw such horrors—both waking and dreaming. Golden coins the color of pitch. Nirn draped in cold silk. What could it mean?"
"115740052-0-27679";"Meet me back at Pariah Abbey, friend. We must learn more!"
"115740052-0-27680";"You found my note! Thank the Rose …. And you, of course."
"115740052-0-27681";"I caught a glimpse of our enemies while I hurtled through Oblivion. They lurk in a ruin, deep within a swamp. The face of a lizard looms above them. More questions …."
"115740052-0-27682";"When the others are safe, we should seek my Lady's counsel. Hurry back to Pariah Abbey!"
"115740052-0-27683";"You found it. This is definitely the place from my vision."
"115740052-0-27684";"What did you find there? A journal?"
"115740052-0-27685";"Ah, I see now. To decipher the future, we have to know the past. This is it."
"115740052-0-27686";"Quick! Set this one free!"
"115740052-0-27687";"Ah, visitors! Let's give them a warm welcome."
"115740052-0-27688";"Mmm. Don't hold back, lover!"
"115740052-0-27689";"More! Yes, give me more!"
"115740052-0-27690";"Oh, aren't you a lovely one? I can't wait to hear you scream."
"115740052-0-27691";"Sweet, foolish mortal. You have no idea what's coming!"
"115740052-0-27692";"Lazy vermin! If you want to eat this week, work!"
"115740052-0-27693";"Yes, mistress!"
"115740052-0-27694";"Well? Get to it—now!"
"115740052-0-27695";"Yes, mistress! Sorry, mistress!"
"115740052-0-27696";"Proceed with caution, egg-friend. The guard captain lurks nearby. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-27697";"And you're sure it's Veya? House Redoran isn't emptying its coffers so you can chase your own tails out here."
"115740052-0-27698";"You pay the Warclaws well because the Warclaws are the best there is. We have the kitten's scent. It's just a matter of time before my warriors catch her."
"115740052-0-27699";"Of course, Ferhara. Just make sure she doesn't get out of the swamp. I'll take my soldiers and guard the eastern paths, in case she eludes your warriors again."
"115740052-0-27700";"Part the gloaming fog. Gaze deep beyond the twilight and perceive …."
"115740052-0-27701";"I see … an island. A mountain of rage and ashes."
"115740052-0-27702";"A great heart, pushing fire as blood …. A source of power, cloaked in secrets."
"115740052-0-27703";"A city of oil and bronze. A shrine to vanity, driven by clockworks and steam …."
"115740052-0-27704";"There's more …. A gathering of Princes … three faces, shrouded. All of Nirn, drowned in blood! Enough!"
"115740052-0-27705";"Enough …."
"115740052-0-27706";"Eoki, what are you do—? Are those bodies?"
"115740052-0-27707";"What? Eoki, this is madness! You'll get me killed!"
"115740052-0-27708";"Come, see how your Telvanni masters treat their slaves."
"115740052-0-27709";"Muthsera, this is the warrior I told you about—the one that exposed the Hlaalu plot and struck down Savarak."
"115740052-0-27710";"Stupid Warclaws! Now I know how a mouse feels …."
"115740052-0-27711";"The slaves are revolting! To arms! Cut them down!"
"115740052-0-27712";"I want to leave! Now!"
"115740052-0-27713";"Oh, Tirwin, where are you? What I'd give for just a glimpse …."
"115740052-0-27714";"C'mon Nixxie! Show yourself!"
"115740052-0-27717";"This is it!  Run!"
"115740052-0-27718";"Rally, my friends! Make your escape!"
"115740052-0-27719";"Do not be afraid. I will make sure you reach the boat safely."
"115740052-0-27720";"Boat? I'm not getting on any boat!"
"115740052-0-27721";"Heart, you are coming with us. In time you will thank me."
"115740052-0-27722";"How dare you!"
"115740052-0-27723";"Help! I'm being kidnapped!"
"115740052-0-27724";"I'm trying to save you!"
"115740052-0-27727";"Ah, look there. The fruits of your labor."
"115740052-0-27728";"It's good to see you alive, my friend. Very good."
"115740052-0-27729";"Indeed. Forgive me for not getting up."
"115740052-0-27730";"Don't take this as an excuse. You're walking again, or else."
"115740052-0-27731";"Stay in line and keep those mouths shut, s'wits, or I'll throw you in prison without your clothes."
"115740052-0-27732";"Ah, the leaders of this pathetic revolt. You will pay dearly!"
"115740052-0-27733";"Wait, you fool! I'm a Telvanni mage! They were kidnapping me!"
"115740052-0-27734";"I weakened your bindings. Please, don't let her kill me!"
"115740052-0-27735";"See you're leaving the estate."
"115740052-0-27736";"Oh, it's you again."
"115740052-0-27737";"The ritual allows me to speak to you through the veil, so keep your mind open when you reach the other side … or as open as you can manage."
"115740052-0-27738";"Mor molag, Kana shanta. Delle nor gandra. Abagaianye!"
"115740052-0-27739";"It's done. Trounce that unruly Dremora and the reward I promised is yours."
"115740052-0-27740";"I hear the rattling of chains … you've arrived. Strike down Xykenaz then hurry back to the portal!"
"115740052-0-27742";"You've done it! His will is spent. Quickly, return to Tel Mora."
"115740052-0-27743";"Mother, wait!"
"115740052-0-27744";"Don't bother protesting, it's already done. Your little pet has been sold."
"115740052-0-27745";"Despite all your sabotage, Mother, love wins the day. Observe!"
"115740052-0-27746";"I'll take my freedom, but I'd rather kiss Mehrunes' Razor than spend another second in your company."
"115740052-0-27747";"T-Tirwin? How dare you! You can't—you're mine! I own you!"
"115740052-0-27748";"Yes … you're right. I can't let him go. I'll tell the others he's injured. That will please him, at least."
"115740052-0-27749";"Llonas! Inside. Now."
"115740052-0-27751";"Nixxie, come! Victory is at hand!"
"115740052-0-27752";"Eoki, you can leave if you want. I won't stop you."
"115740052-0-27753";"The House will betray you, Sun-in-Shadow. On that day, I hope you think of what we could have had."
"115740052-0-27754";"I need a moment. We can talk outside."
"115740052-0-27755";"Stand back and let your majesty make magic!"
"115740052-0-27756";"A pinch of this … a dash of that … give it a shake—"
"115740052-0-27757";"Voila …"
"115740052-0-27758";"Your dazzlers, my faithful subject!"
"115740052-0-27759";"We can mourn later, Eoki. We have to go!"
"115740052-0-27760";"May your soul return to the Hist, my friend …."
"115740052-0-27761";"I shall begin the summoning immediately. Llayne, be ready."
"115740052-0-27762";"Arenim wounded Eoki. I stabilized him, but he can't travel. He said you should leave without him."
"115740052-0-27763";"Damn. We'll wait at the coast for as long as we can. Wish him good luck … and thank you."
"115740052-0-27764";"This one has forged a humorousness for you fair queen."
"115740052-0-27765";"I will tell him. Now go."
"115740052-0-27766";"Intruders! I'll fetch the slavemaster!"
"115740052-0-27767";"Oh, my! You shouldn't have. Let's hear it!"
"115740052-0-27768";"What do you call a Bosmer who arbors eating his neighbors?"
"115740052-0-27769";"I—what …?"
"115740052-0-27770";"Dinner!"
"115740052-0-27771";"Oh! Hah! Hah! Ah … you really shouldn't have."
"115740052-0-27772";"No one knows! They can't keep one alive long enough to get through the ceremony!"
"115740052-0-27773";"Tell me, Jorunn. How many Imperials does it take to crown an Emperor?"
"115740052-0-27774";"This one does not do counting, only wordiness."
"115740052-0-27775";"Oh! Ho! Yes, they do die at an alarmed rate!"
"115740052-0-27776";"Ayrenn, do you know the difference between Nords and pigs?"
"115740052-0-27777";"Oh! No, I don't think I do."
"115740052-0-27778";"Pigs don't turn into Nords when they drink!"
"115740052-0-27779";"I don't know that I've seen a pig drink."
"115740052-0-27780";"Bah, pearls before swine!"
"115740052-0-27781";"I expected you hours ago, hero. It's not polite to keep an assassin waiting."
"115740052-0-27782";"Ah! An Ashlander! Run friend!"
"115740052-0-27783";"I'm sorry! I just want to go home!"
"115740052-0-27789";"What now? An Ashlander! Keep your distance! Understand?"
"115740052-0-27790";"Peace, Armigers. I must speak with the outlander, that is all."
"115740052-0-27791";"If you wish to hear him out, I'll permit it, but don't let your guard down."
"115740052-0-27792";"That looks to be the last of them … for now."
"115740052-0-27793";"Where is it? Where is she?"
"115740052-0-27794";"Vivec, protect me!"
"115740052-0-27795";"Fine …. I just need a breather."
"115740052-0-27797";"What are you doing? You can't just go around killing Redoran soldiers! My reputation's on the line here!"
"115740052-0-27798";"The front door's guarded like a bank vault. Maybe there's another way in through one of the buildings by the docks."
"115740052-0-27799";"This looks promising. Might even lead to the wine cellars. I could use a good bottle of wine."
"115740052-0-27800";"Be quick with your questions, hero. When I slip in, so do my daggers."
"115740052-0-27801";"Get out of there!"
"115740052-0-27802";"That was too close!"
"115740052-0-27803";"Another obstacle overcome by the great Narsis Dren!"
"115740052-0-27804";"A bedroll, still wrapped and ready to use. Standard issue for a Redoran soldier."
"115740052-0-27805";"A Redoran officer's sword. No Redoran soldier would leave that behind willingly."
"115740052-0-27806";"Corporal Darvel … I knew him. But the others, they're civilians. They must have taken Telem's soldiers inside."
"115740052-0-27807";"Locked! Figures. Let's see if one of these damn cultists has a key."
"115740052-0-27808";"There we go. Let's get inside and find the others before it's too late."
"115740052-0-27809";"Gathering up my gifts for me? Come along, beautiful. I want to repay you … personally."
"115740052-0-27810";"Let's find the soldiers and get out of here before these stupid cultists realize what's happening."
"115740052-0-27811";"Who's there? We won't let you take us without a fight! Wait—Veya, is that you?"
"115740052-0-27812";"Thank the Three, you're all still alive!"
"115740052-0-27814";"You find the key. Me and Vatola, we're going to have a little chat while we're waiting."
"115740052-0-27815";"Veya, I'm just trying to protect you …."
"115740052-0-27816";"From what? The truth? Oh, please! I want to know who did this to my brother."
"115740052-0-27817";"Ah, another sacrifice for the Prince of Bargains!"
"115740052-0-27818";"Veya, wait! You can't leave us like this!"
"115740052-0-27819";"Thank you. Now get to Balmora and stop Veya before she does something she'll regret."
"115740052-0-27820";"How dare you! When House Redoran hears about this, you're going to regret your actions!"
"115740052-0-27821";"Drores? Why didn't you wake me? Have you been drinking the aged flin again?"
"115740052-0-27822";"Treacherous slave! I'll have your head!"
"115740052-0-27823";"Scour the streets. Search the buildings. Veya Releth does not leave this city!"
"115740052-0-27824";"What's the meaning of this? Where are the soldiers?"
"115740052-0-27825";"Go to my hut and get my healer's sack. Now!"
"115740052-0-27826";"Right away, Wise Woman!"
"115740052-0-27827";"Dead soldiers? They were just protecting the kinhouse. I'll … I'll go stay with my sister in Vivec."
"115740052-0-27833";"Glad to see we all made it. Now let's find Brivan before Veya skewers him."
"115740052-0-27834";"Another rescue, Sergeant? Let me just record the name in my ledger."
"115740052-0-27835";"Not this one. Governor Salvi doesn't want an official record."
"115740052-0-27836";"Really? Very well. The Governor's in her office."
"115740052-0-27837";"Nothing yet, eh? I hear voices behind this door, but it's locked tight. Keep looking, hero."
"115740052-0-27838";"Kill the intruders! They have interfered for the last time!"
"115740052-0-27842";"That's for Ulran. Choke on your own blood, you bastard."
"115740052-0-27844";"My father, the entire council, they're all guilty. They all have to die. I have to do this, so stay out of my way."
"115740052-0-27847";"Veya actually did it. She killed Brivan in cold blood."
"115740052-0-27848";"A moment, Governor. Here's my honorable writ of execution for the slaver captain."
"115740052-0-27849";"Hmm. These papers appear to be in order."
"115740052-0-27850";"We're done here, hero. But don't worry, I'm sure we'll see each other again."
"115740052-0-27851";"I suppose you can go now. And we'll leave your name out of the official record. Just don't make me regret this."
"115740052-0-27852";"What's going on down here? It sounds like a—you! What are you doing here? Explain yourself!"
"115740052-0-27853";"And who might you be?"
"115740052-0-27854";"Nothing's more important than reaching the council meeting. If the mercenaries get in our way, cut them down!"
"115740052-0-27855";"Father? I'm here. Come out and tell me why you killed my brother."
"115740052-0-27856";"Everyone calm down! Councilor Eris will deal with this. We're safe in here. There's no need to panic."
"115740052-0-27857";"No need to panic? She's cut down every mercenary in her way! Her father won't be able to stop her."
"115740052-0-27858";"Veya's getting close. We're running out of time."
"115740052-0-27861";"Veya, daughter. I'm so sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen."
"115740052-0-27862";"Father, why? Does the House really matter more than your own son?"
"115740052-0-27863";"I needed to protect Ulran … to prove his loyalty. If I could do it all over again …."
"115740052-0-27864";"Let me try to open this door."
"115740052-0-27865";"But you can't! None of us can …. That's why I have to do this."
"115740052-0-27867";"I'm not your apprentice any more. The House has grown corrupt, evil. That's why all the councilors have to die."
"115740052-0-27869";"Enough, Veya! This isn't the way."
"115740052-0-27870";"Veya, no! That's an order!"
"115740052-0-27871";"No more rules! No more secrets! House Redoran falls today!"
"115740052-0-27872";"Veya's down. It's over."
"115740052-0-27873";"So much bloodshed. So much needless death. If only Eris would have listened."
"115740052-0-27874";"Outlander, we should speak. I think we can help one another."
"115740052-0-27875";"Good riddance to bad writing."
"115740052-0-27876";"How many times have I told you not to stick your blade in your apprentices, Naryu? She'll live, but she can't stay here. Not after what she's done."
"115740052-0-27877";"I've got that covered. Veya won't be staying in Vvardenfell."
"115740052-0-27878";"This is Magister Gothren's private property. Keep walking."
"115740052-0-27879";"Naryu? What happened?"
"115740052-0-27880";"Quiet, Veya. Rest now. We can talk later."
"115740052-0-27881";"More deaths, more blood on my hands. Just another day in the Morag Tong, eh hero?"
"115740052-0-27882";"I need a nice, warm bath. I hear the one's in Vivec are spectacular. I'd ask you to join me, but there's barely going to be enough room for me and my hangover."
"115740052-0-27883";"What … was that?"
"115740052-0-27884";"Struggle all you like. The call of Kogoruhn will never be silenced."
"115740052-0-27885";"Wait. What was that noise?"
"115740052-0-27886";"No! Darsho will not go!"
"115740052-0-27887";"Darsho is … free at last."
"115740052-0-27888";"Ah, my favorite dupe has finally arrived!"
"115740052-0-27889";"I think I'll go pretend to work somewhere else."
"115740052-0-27890";"Ferhara assumes the councilor's minions will not present a problem for the Warclaws, yes, Captain?"
"115740052-0-27891";"The Outlanders have been warned, Ferhara. I leave everything else to your discretion."
"115740052-0-27892";"Hey, where's my pig? Who took my pig!"
"115740052-0-27895";"Ha, found you!"
"115740052-0-27899";"Oh dear, oh dear. Locked tight! Lucky for me, I've got Sunna'rah!"
"115740052-0-27900";"Lord Vivec isn't receiving visitors today."
"115740052-0-27901";"Meet me in the cave to the north when you finish with the mercenaries."
"115740052-0-27902";"Pull yourself together! You're a Buoyant Armiger, for Vivec's sake!"
"115740052-0-27903";"It burns! It burns!"
"115740052-0-27904";"Lord Vivec, save us!"
"115740052-0-27905";"I can smell the Dark Elf kitten. Looks like we're the first ones here!"
"115740052-0-27906";"Up here! Hurry, before more of them show up!"
"115740052-0-27907";"Warclaws! Let's flay this outsider!"
"115740052-0-27908";"If you are looking for that evil tempered Telvanni witch, she went into that room."
"115740052-0-27909";"I'll have her skin for gloves, after I deal with you of course!"
"115740052-0-27910";"Is someone up there? I could use some help down here!"
"115740052-0-27911";"Hurry, please! I have a natural aversion to Daedra!"
"115740052-0-27912";"Sounds like the danger is past. Wipe your feet and come inside."
"115740052-0-27914";"That should take care of the defenses. At least, the most dangerous ones."
"115740052-0-27916";"Go on without me!"
"115740052-0-27917";"If you insist!"
"115740052-0-27918";"Hey, no! Wait for me!"
"115740052-0-27919";"Come on! I was just being noble!"
"115740052-0-27920";"Almost caught me! Too bad you'll never get past the gate while the fabricants protect it."
"115740052-0-27921";"Oh, you've made such a mess."
"115740052-0-27922";"What will Sotha Sil think?"
"115740052-0-27923";"All done, must run!"
"115740052-0-27925";"So House Redoran issued an advisory against the Morag Tong? Fat lot of good that's going to do the councilor."
"115740052-0-27926";"If we don't find anything, maybe we can ask for an invitation to the upcoming council meeting. I'm sure they'd be happy to answer our questions."
"115740052-0-27927";"Damn the luck! I was hoping for a quick stab and go, but it seems the councilor might actually know something about Ulran."
"115740052-0-27928";"Not yet, hero. Let's make one more sweep before we confront our target."
"115740052-0-27929";"Ah, you must be here about those pesky patrol schedules."
"115740052-0-27930";"After all that clandestine correspondence, it's a pleasure to finally meet you in person."
"115740052-0-27931";"Damn. Where are those cakes?"
"115740052-0-27933";"Now, come closer so we can celebrate our partnership in a proper fashion."
"115740052-0-27934";"How dare you! I'm a lord of House Redoran! The Morag Tong …."
"115740052-0-27938";"I dare say, help! Help!"
"115740052-0-27939";"Come speak to us before you go in after him."
"115740052-0-27940";"Hist bless you. Tell her to seek me out near Tel Naga."
"115740052-0-27941";"Ah, good. You found Stibbons. Probably just got turned around in the ruins again."
"115740052-0-27942";"I beg m'lady's pardon. I really thought I could solve the case of the missing mages."
"115740052-0-27943";"Whatever gave you that idea? You can barely manage not to lose my collection of combs and brushes every time you pack them!"
"115740052-0-27944";"But … but … Investigator Vale …. I mean, would m'lady like her tea now?"
"115740052-0-27945";"And some of those sweet biscuits I like. Let's return to camp so you can start cooking!"
"115740052-0-27946";"Of course, m'lady. Right away."
"115740052-0-27947";"And Stibbons, I want my book back. I must find out what happens when Investigator Vale meets the innkeeper's daughter in the wine cellar. I'm sure it will be scandalous!"
"115740052-0-27948";"Beautiful, isn't it? One of Sotha Sil's favorite ateliers. I think Barbas is already inside."
"115740052-0-27949";"The Magister is expecting you. Good luck."
"115740052-0-27950";"Ahh! A spider!"
"115740052-0-27951";"I'm … still conscious?"
"115740052-0-27952";"My tea worked! Head for the ruins and find the spider that talked to you, Stibbons!"
"115740052-0-27953";"As you command, m'lady."
"115740052-0-27954";"Another spider! And it's talking to me!"
"115740052-0-27955";"Follow my man-servant!"
"115740052-0-27956";"Your neck is most skinny for a ruler."
"115740052-0-27957";"Oh no! Is that concerning?"
"115740052-0-27958";"Crowned heads are known for their heaviness, Jorunn's especially. He knows the secret to a long rule is a strong neck."
"115740052-0-27959";"How do you keep your neck as thick as your head? I must know!"
"115740052-0-27960";"Shrug at every opportunity."
"115740052-0-27961";"Jorunn! I have an answer to all the dreadful fighting for the Ruby Throne!"
"115740052-0-27962";"Surrender?"
"115740052-0-27963";"No, silly! A beauty contest! All of Tamriel could bask in our regality and choose the leader they adore most!"
"115740052-0-27964";"That would not be fair."
"115740052-0-27965";"Well, of course there could only be one possible winner."
"115740052-0-27966";"Do not let it disparage you. The silkiness of Jorunn's back-hair puts many to shame."
"115740052-0-27967";"Hello my simple, cousins!"
"115740052-0-27968";"I know we have our differences, but I know behind all your gloomy, pallid, muck-speckled faces there's a hint of proud elven heritage."
"115740052-0-27969";"I only hope to inspire you all to take pride in that scant bit of nobility clinging to your lineage for generations."
"115740052-0-27970";"When I'm your empress—ow!"
"115740052-0-27971";"This one thinks they like you!"
"115740052-0-27972";"In the isles, we shower our beloved leaders in flowers, but if this is the Daggerfall custom … thank you for welcoming me future subjects!"
"115740052-0-27973";"Ouch! Thank you! Mind the royal face! Oh! Cold one! I'm honored! This is mud, right?"
"115740052-0-27974";"There once was a Man named Ysgramor, who found his homeland a bore. So he conjured his art, and let out a fart, that filled his sails to far away shores!"
"115740052-0-27975";"Stibbons, I have something I'd like you to read."
"115740052-0-27976";"What's this? The newest Investigator Vale mystery?"
"115740052-0-27977";"Just read it out loud and tell me what it says."
"115740052-0-27978";"A read-aloud? What fun!"
"115740052-0-27979";"Just enunciate, Stibbons. And speak loudly."
"115740052-0-27980";"Any time now, Stibbons."
"115740052-0-27981";"This isn't the newest Investigator Vale mystery …."
"115740052-0-27982";"Read the scroll, Stibbons!"
"115740052-0-27983";"Something, something … Mad God flows and ebbs. Something, something … call forth the tangled webs …. Oh no, that doesn't sound good …."
"115740052-0-27984";"Really, Stibbons? You do manage to complicate the simplest tasks."
"115740052-0-27985";"After you."
"115740052-0-27986";"I was right! It is some kind of Daedric ritual, led by a hulking Nord priest!"
"115740052-0-27987";"Brave assistant, do something!"
"115740052-0-27988";"Stibbons! You look ridiculous! Stop dancing this instant!"
"115740052-0-27989";"Why do my feet hurt? Oh, never mind. Run!"
"115740052-0-27990";"Ahaha! Come to join our dance?"
"115740052-0-27991";"Dance! Shake your nethers for the Mad God!"
"115740052-0-27992";"No! The dance must not be interrupted!"
"115740052-0-27993";"Do you think there is anywhere we have missed? Any place where the Jester's Festival is not in full swinginess?"
"115740052-0-27994";"I imagine there is not much laughter in Coldharbour. Ever."
"115740052-0-27995";"Not so! Legend speaks of a fool so great he laughs in the face of Daedra and keeps cheer alive in the darkness of Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-27996";"Truely? I can think of no greater fool."
"115740052-0-27997";"Jorunn aspires to be an ass of such magnitude."
"115740052-0-27998";"Stop me if you've heard the tale of—ow!"
"115740052-0-27999";"This one has heard all your silly Breton stories."
"115740052-0-28000";"I was speaking to our subjects, not you, you man-sized ham!"
"115740052-0-28001";"They do not look in need of a nap."
"115740052-0-28002";"But think of what mischief could be had if they were asleep!"
"115740052-0-28003";"Ah! This place is nice! Why has Jorunn not invaded it before?"
"115740052-0-28004";"Because you're the only Nord fat enough to float here?"
"115740052-0-28005";"Jorunn did not swim to Vulkhel Guard, though he is drenched. This place is too hot for clothing."
"115740052-0-28006";"No! Don't you dare strip naked!"
"115740052-0-28007";"Jorunn wishes to glisten in the warm breeze!"
"115740052-0-28008";"My kingdom for a scroll of frost!"
"115740052-0-28009";"Is it true that High Elves only eat flowers and drink the light?"
"115740052-0-28010";"I would describe them as pesky weeds."
"115740052-0-28011";"Jorunn could not live such a life. Is he to starve and discover soberness here?"
"115740052-0-28012";"Perhaps you should visit the Wood Elves next time."
"115740052-0-28013";"This one would, but he cannot fit through their doors."
"115740052-0-28014";"Do you know the trouble with Morrowind feasts?"
"115740052-0-28015";"All the poisonings?"
"115740052-0-28016";"No, besides that!"
"115740052-0-28017";"The squishy bug glop?"
"115740052-0-28018";"Yes, but—"
"115740052-0-28019";"The long silent glowering?"
"115740052-0-28020";"Everything comes out smoked …! But seriously, they really are dreadful, aren't they?"
"115740052-0-28021";"Achoo!"
"115740052-0-28022";"I told you not to sniff the sneezing powder."
"115740052-0-28023";"Achoo! I—Achoo! I didn't! It's this dry air!"
"115740052-0-28024";"Ah, yes. I empathize. It's murder on the skin. Just look at me."
"115740052-0-28025";"Oh! You should get that looked at, you're practically a lizard!"
"115740052-0-28026";"I don't know if I can stomach anymore of that belching!"
"115740052-0-28027";"I think it's got a melodic quality. Besides, if we stopped it, Jorunn might explode!"
"115740052-0-28028";"Not him! Those wretched lava flows!"
"115740052-0-28029";"Oh? Why do those vex you?"
"115740052-0-28030";"Let's just say I don't think Ashlands is the most accurate moniker if you're accounting for smell."
"115740052-0-28031";"Emeric!"
"115740052-0-28032";"Oh no!"
"115740052-0-28033";"Emeric! Our quarters are full of bugs! Is this the respect your name command here?"
"115740052-0-28034";"Um, well, yes, my flower. You see, those were breakfast."
"115740052-0-28035";"You expect me to eat that! The nerve!"
"115740052-0-28036";"I … thought they were quite good …"
"115740052-0-28038";"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Llayne. You know I detest them. Approach, outlander."
"115740052-0-28039";"Don't explode!"
"115740052-0-28040";"Whew! Almost done …"
"115740052-0-28041";"There!"
"115740052-0-28043";"Incarnate, appear!"
"115740052-0-28044";"Just tell me where to put the egg. I'll let you take it from there."
"115740052-0-28045";"Take care of yourself, Father. You always were good at that."
"115740052-0-28046";"Once this is down, the other kwama are going to try and stop it from hatching. Make sure it does. Once they see it's a queen, they'll leave it alone."
"115740052-0-28047";"Mils, please, if you'd just listen …."
"115740052-0-28048";"I'll head outside to ensure no one comes in before you're done. Good luck."
"115740052-0-28050";"By Malacath's sacred tusks, you won't get past me!"
"115740052-0-28051";"Ow! Stupid dog!"
"115740052-0-28052";"What happened? Let me see!"
"115740052-0-28053";"I just tried to pet it! Damn dog bit me."
"115740052-0-28054";"Leave it alone! There's something strange about that dog."
"115740052-0-28056";"No way forward! No way back! Let us through, monster!"
"115740052-0-28057";"The only thing it'll understand is pain! Slaughter it and be done!"
"115740052-0-28058";"Carve out its stone heart!"
"115740052-0-28060";"Nice chat, but I've got to run. I have a barrel of Vivec energy to collect!"
"115740052-0-28061";"You can't stop me if the defenses won't let you in!"
"115740052-0-28062";"Such a good and faithful hound! You have done enough for now."
"115740052-0-28063";"Get your arse over here, hero. We've got a situation and it's not good."
"115740052-0-28064";"I can feel it! Clavicus Vile is almost here!"
"115740052-0-28067";"Lots of interference. Makes it difficult to lock onto a destination. I'll go ahead to stabilize the connection."
"115740052-0-28068";"Seize Sunna'rah. Then retrieve Lord Vivec's energy from the reservoir conduit!"
"115740052-0-28069";"I'll offer you to the Hunt-Father myself!"
"115740052-0-28070";"To the ancient crypt! My next book is going to be a trilogy for sure!"
"115740052-0-28071";"Friend! Can we speak a moment?"
"115740052-0-28072";"Another lazy slave? I'll kill you too!"
"115740052-0-28073";"I'll beat you to a pulp!"
"115740052-0-28074";"Join my other rebellious slaves! Die!"
"115740052-0-28075";"To arms! We're under attack!"
"115740052-0-28076";"Fire! Fire!"
"115740052-0-28077";"Find that damned saboteur!"
"115740052-0-28078";"Useless! No one leaves until we clean up this mess!"
"115740052-0-28079";"Look at this! Preserved bodies, not cremated ashes! A technique that pre-dates the earliest Dark Elves."
"115740052-0-28080";"This land is more hostile than I expected … maybe we should have gone with Farwen to set the wards."
"115740052-0-28081";"Assuage your doubts, my friend. Farwen is a righteous woman who smites evil with her depth of goodness! She will be fine."
"115740052-0-28082";"Chodala, brother, stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-28083";"The tonal inverter is ready. Stand in the field and focus the wave."
"115740052-0-28086";"Worthy … prey …."
"115740052-0-28092";"Meddler! Imposter! You won't leave this cavern alive!"
"115740052-0-28093";"Now we're trapped! We should have run with the others!"
"115740052-0-28094";"No, look! Their fire-spit can't reach us here. We just have to hold out …."
"115740052-0-28097";"You meddlesome prat! Dratha may survive, but I'll make sure you won't!"
"115740052-0-28098";"My blood for you Hunt-Father! Feast eternal!"
"115740052-0-28099";"The Forge … it's calling!"
"115740052-0-28109";"I hope this is good news."
"115740052-0-28115";"Well, I suppose we're done here. I have a silt strider waiting."
"115740052-0-28119";"The door is open! Open at last! Hee-hee-hee!"
"115740052-0-28123";"I think the Hound used Sunna'rah to get inside. We have to hurry!"
"115740052-0-28124";"Daedra! Vile creatures of chaos! Deal with them, please."
"115740052-0-28125";"Assistant, wait! Those skaafin have agitated one of the guardians!"
"115740052-0-28126";"Well done! Just let me gaze on Sotha Sil's inspiring creation before we go inside."
"115740052-0-28128";"Join us for eternity!"
"115740052-0-28129";"You can talk to the Daedric dog if you want, then follow me into the maintenance junction."
"115740052-0-28130";"Place the essence in the circle here. We're ready to begin the summoning."
"115740052-0-28131";"Oh, brother, why did it have to come to this?"
"115740052-0-28132";"Azura, we've dealt with the false Nerevarine, just as you commanded."
"115740052-0-28133";"Rise up, spirit and be bound to my command!"
"115740052-0-28134";"Why do you summon me, vessels?"
"115740052-0-28135";"Vengeful spirit, you will tell us where your master holds our friend!"
"115740052-0-28136";"Silence, weaklings. I will speak to the one who brought me here."
"115740052-0-28137";"W—wait, that's not how this is supposed to work."
"115740052-0-28138";"You lack the will to command me."
"115740052-0-28139";"I'm sure you do. I'd like to see how this ends, but alas …."
"115740052-0-28140";"And there goes our ward. Guess Farwen's spell could only hold so long without her being here."
"115740052-0-28141";"Ward or not, I expect my land to be cleared and soon."
"115740052-0-28143";"All right team, we're packing up and heading back to town. Our friend will handle it from here."
"115740052-0-28144";"What? What are you talking about? You've hardly done anything! I expect you to clear this ruin, not run away with your tail tucked between your legs!"
"115740052-0-28145";"Seeing as you withheld information that's jeopardizing the lives of my team, you voided our satisfaction guarantee. We're leaving, I suggest you follow."
"115740052-0-28148";"Here you are. I had hoped to greet you as a friend, but we will be very close soon."
"115740052-0-28149";"Strong! Too strong! I can't have you, but fortunately I have other playthings."
"115740052-0-28151";"Free? Am I free? I was a prisoner? Can't think. I—I have to get away!"
"115740052-0-28152";"And our hero returns! Let's hear it for our friend here!"
"115740052-0-28153";"To bravery, honor, and righteousness!"
"115740052-0-28154";"May the Old God's blessings be upon you!"
"115740052-0-28156";"The hound is right. Disable the factotums and the gate couplings. I can always repair them later."
"115740052-0-28157";"I can use these controls! Follow Barbas!"
"115740052-0-28158";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-28159";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-28160";"Vivec's toy has me, you annoying creature. This way!"
"115740052-0-28161";"When you're finished with those fabricants, follow me!"
"115740052-0-28162";"Brivan is the finest soldier I know. He'll set Veya straight, I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-28163";"The hound wants your head!"
"115740052-0-28164";"Hey! Get away from her! You'll ruin everything!"
"115740052-0-28165";"Shut up you slavering jackal! You see this? I'm free!"
"115740052-0-28166";"T-Tirwin? I … I was supposed to free you. I was going to take your hand in marriage. It was going to be perfect. You ruined it!"
"115740052-0-28167";"Listen to me you little s'wit. I'm not your plaything. Never was and never will be. I'd sooner lie with the maggots than share your bed."
"115740052-0-28168";"That can be arranged! When I tell Mother about this, you'll wish you'd never spurned me! You'll beg! You will beg!"
"115740052-0-28169";"Captain Brivan is on his way! Soon we'll have a permanent job in House Redoran, yes?"
"115740052-0-28170";"Good. Deal with any loose ends."
"115740052-0-28171";"The realms are bleeding together around the locus. Not unlike the Planemeld. We must stabilize the rift before it drags anything else through."
"115740052-0-28172";"There you are! Nixxie—go find star shells! Show this nice person where they are!"
"115740052-0-28173";"This structure has some hold on the rift, or the other way around. I'll investigate while you finish up down there."
"115740052-0-28174";"Praise Vivec!"
"115740052-0-28175";"Let's go, Mils. He's still your father."
"115740052-0-28176";"He has an odd way of showing it."
"115740052-0-28177";"So you're the mortal who gave my poor dog so much trouble. I suppose we should have a chat, you and I."
"115740052-0-28178";"Master …."
"115740052-0-28179";"Quiet, dog! Haven't you—wait, who dares intrude upon my lesson?"
"115740052-0-28180";"Panels on the walls. Do you see any differences?"
"115740052-0-28181";"Found you! Over here … oh. Clavicus Vile. This isn't good."
"115740052-0-28182";"The master went upstairs to rest. He did not wish to be disturbed until you arrived."
"115740052-0-28183";"That stings, little flea! I'll crush you for that!"
"115740052-0-28184";"Interesting. These devices have all reset themselves. I didn't do that."
"115740052-0-28185";"Another surge in the rift. A big one! Prepare for the worst!"
"115740052-0-28186";"There! Somethings coming through! Another fabricant! Oh! That's a new one."
"115740052-0-28187";"Work faster you lazy beast!"
"115740052-0-28188";"What is—? Oh no!"
"115740052-0-28189";"Fire! Fire!"
"115740052-0-28190";"Do something, you s'wit!"
"115740052-0-28191";"Okay. Must be a bucket around here somewhere …."
"115740052-0-28192";"Where's the guard? Don't tell me he took a break?"
"115740052-0-28194";"Take this report to Mouth Ralasa. Immediately."
"115740052-0-28195";"Yes, Captain. It will be done."
"115740052-0-28196";"Once again, it's been a pleasure. Farewell, Sun-in-Shadow."
"115740052-0-28200";"My associate will be here soon. Patience, Governor."
"115740052-0-28203";"The witch's servant, eh? Your soul is forfeit, summoner!"
"115740052-0-28205";"Rejoice! You cursed the darkness, with good reason. Now praise the return of the light!"
"115740052-0-28206";"I suppose the order is important, but a few of the panels have fallen into disrepair."
"115740052-0-28208";"That's it! Just step in the proper order and the way will be opened!"
"115740052-0-28210";"<<1>>, you sacrificed your Blessing Stones to aid the Warrior-Poet. Well done! Take these recharged stones and finish building my city—after relaxing with your patient wife."
"115740052-0-28212";"Thank you, Lord Vivec. I shall do as you ask."
"115740052-0-28213";"<<1>>, step forth!"
"115740052-0-28214";"<<1>>, approach!"
"115740052-0-28215";"The rift is stable. Let it not be said that there was a portal I could not tame!"
"115740052-0-28216";"Your knowledge of the mysteries of my brother Sotha Sil and the intricate twists and turns of portal magic were invaluable. Take this and use it well to further your experiments."
"115740052-0-28217";"Now, my old friend, what inspiration has divinity brought you?"
"115740052-0-28218";"Gemstones, filled with a tiny fraction of divine energy! Amazing and so very generous! With careful tuning, this could improve portal magic a hundredfold! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-28219";"Was that—? Did Lord Vivec summon me?"
"115740052-0-28220";"Canon Llevule, kneel before me!"
"115740052-0-28221";"Archcanon Tarvus served us well until his death. But when I was most in need of assistance, Canon Llevule rose to the occasion. Now rise once more—as Archcanon Llevule!"
"115740052-0-28222";"My lord … I'm not worthy! But I shall endeavor to become so. Thank you. And I can't wait to inform my ancestors!"
"115740052-0-28223";"In every poem, it's the last stanza that holds the most meaning. Once a stranger to our land, now a friend forever—step forward!"
"115740052-0-28224";"Is that for Cherishes-Water? Poor dear. Her scales are very sensitive, you know."
"115740052-0-28225";"Deputy Governor …."
"115740052-0-28226";"Deputy Governor?"
"115740052-0-28227";"Ah! That feels much better!"
"115740052-0-28228";"Here, let me give you a taste of divine power!"
"115740052-0-28229";"Patience, Master. The portal is almost ready!"
"115740052-0-28230";"Can't you feel it? The way to Oblivion is opening wide!"
"115740052-0-28231";"It's working, Master! Vivec's energy was the key!"
"115740052-0-28232";"I've turned this contrivance into a portal machine!"
"115740052-0-28233";"Those ruins belong to Galgalah and his curse. You sent those people to their deaths."
"115740052-0-28234";"Your tales of make believe may scare off gullible travelers, but not me. Those ruins belong to me now. My people will be cleansing this ""curse"" in no time."
"115740052-0-28235";"You will only join Galgalah's collection of puppets. If we see you again, we will assume you are a vessel of his and kill you on sight. You have been warned."
"115740052-0-28236";"""Well, it's about time. Come, servant."""
"115740052-0-28237";"Now go forth and rejoice!"
"115740052-0-28238";"Right …."
"115740052-0-28239";"Ah! There you are, finally!"
"115740052-0-28240";"I've had my fill of rooting through garbage while this lackwit drones on."
"115740052-0-28241";"Reprocessing yard contamination critical. Disassembly status suspended. Mass reactivation initiated."
"115740052-0-28242";"Fascinating—Look! The scrap heaps!"
"115740052-0-28243";"So? Any luck?"
"115740052-0-28244";"Wait until I leave to unlock that thing, all right? I'm not anxious to see what happens when you pull that crystal … prism. Whatever."
"115740052-0-28245";"Are you listening, construct?"
"115740052-0-28246";"That was liberating. Don't worry, I know these lands better than they ever will. Thanks again!"
"115740052-0-28247";"Ah, you are the one I seek."
"115740052-0-28248";"Tirwin, my love. Nothing can stand between us now. Take my hand and we'll be married within the hour!"
"115740052-0-28251";"Yes, Mother …."
"115740052-0-28253";"I see you're busy. I can occupy myself for now."
"115740052-0-28254";"Is someone there? Help! I've been tied up!"
"115740052-0-28256";"One more late shipment, Bolyn, and you will never work in Vvardenfell again."
"115740052-0-28257";"I'm terribly sorry, master, it won't happen again."
"115740052-0-28258";"Ah, another useful idiot approaches. And what trifling matter brings you to me?"
"115740052-0-28259";"And that concludes my deliveries for today. What an exciting life I lead."
"115740052-0-28260";"Query denied: Creator not found."
"115740052-0-28261";"Close enough. We're coming for you, you chattering collection of cogs!"
"115740052-0-28262";"If you'll all excuse me, I'm going to find some more wine. This day has been quite taxing."
"115740052-0-28263";"Don't come out! They're bombarding the ship!  Wait, who …?"
"115740052-0-28264";"We may find something helpful in this workstation. Draw its attention elsewhere. I'll catch up."
"115740052-0-28268";"What did we hit? Our weapons can't cause that much damage."
"115740052-0-28269";"Look, in the water! A survivor! Grab the net."
"115740052-0-28270";"Well, well. Now that's the second largest construct I've ever seen. Inactive, at the moment."
"115740052-0-28271";"Initializing internal scan."
"115740052-0-28272";"I expect that will no longer be the case shortly."
"115740052-0-28273";"Aha! There's its cogitation array, in the distance. Keep the body distracted while I unravel its mind."
"115740052-0-28274";"Organic contamination detected within control center."
"115740052-0-28275";"Assuming manual control. Surrogate avatar … synchronized."
"115740052-0-28276";"I'm sure you'll do fine! I'll yell if I need anything!"
"115740052-0-28277";"Finally. Quiet. Now, to study this mechanism in peace."
"115740052-0-28278";"What secrets do you hold of your creator's processes, hmm?"
"115740052-0-28279";"It will take years to sort through this information … though perhaps I can repurpose an animunculi to sift the archives."
"115740052-0-28283";"Nothing of the scale of what we've seen here. A harmless little spider, perhaps? Or maybe something with a face? It'll need more personality than this one possesses."
"115740052-0-28286";"Do give my regards to Sun-in-Shadow. Farewell!"
"115740052-0-28287";"Rosy! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-28288";"There you are, Rosy!"
"115740052-0-28289";"Oh, I'm so relieved. Never fly off like that again!"
"115740052-0-28290";"I'm sure she'll come back. Oh, she must be so frightened."
"115740052-0-28291";"Don't worry, Rosy! I'm coming to get you!"
"115740052-0-28292";"What in the… Dammit!"
"115740052-0-28293";"A clockwork mage?"
"115740052-0-28294";"An Ashlander?"
"115740052-0-28295";"A Daedric cultist?"
"115740052-0-28296";"Outlander, quickly, this way!"
"115740052-0-28297";"Sun-in-Shadow, free me! I can help!"
"115740052-0-28298";"Eoki, stay quiet!"
"115740052-0-28299";"Sun-in-Shadow, what are you doing?"
"115740052-0-28300";"That was … exhilarating!"
"115740052-0-28301";"Go. I will follow in a moment."
"115740052-0-28302";"They're channeling energy throughout the junkyard … and it's reacting."
"115740052-0-28303";"These fabricants are forming a circuit. Breaking those links may weaken them."
"115740052-0-28304";"It's gone haywire! Damaging the others should cause a similar reaction!"
"115740052-0-28307";"My protective shield—what have you done? I'll destroy all of you for this!"
"115740052-0-28309";"The spiders, they call to me!"
"115740052-0-28310";"I will join the dance!"
"115740052-0-28311";"By dawn and dusk, evil creeps through the shadows of my beloved Vvardenfell! But an outlander arrives to aid my people, just as I have foreseen."
"115740052-0-28312";"Mortal, I would have words with you."
"115740052-0-28313";"I need a moment to get this working …."
"115740052-0-28314";"You dare refuse me, Malacath? I am the Nerevarine!"
"115740052-0-28315";"Well, what do we have here?"
"115740052-0-28316";"Follow me, brave assistant!"
"115740052-0-28317";"Naturally, we will be reducing your compensation accordingly!"
"115740052-0-28318";"We've been waiting to see Lord Vivec for three days. Do you think something's wrong?"
"115740052-0-28319";"I don't know. The Buoyant Armigers say there's nothing to worry about, but something feels wrong."
"115740052-0-28320";"You two need to stop worrying. Everything is fine. The Ordinators say so!"
"115740052-0-28321";"I feel so renewed. Vivec City is truly amazing."
"115740052-0-28322";"Are you sure you're all right? The ordeal with Baar Dau was terrifying."
"115740052-0-28323";"What ordeal? I don't know what you're talking about."
"115740052-0-28324";"Never mind. You're right. The city is amazing."
"115740052-0-28325";"Is it true? There's a new archcanon?"
"115740052-0-28326";"Of course! There was a wonderful ceremony and everything!"
"115740052-0-28327";"I've never been that close to Lord Vivec before. Archcanon Llevule will do wonders for the city!"
"115740052-0-28328";"I do hope so."
"115740052-0-28329";"Work has been slow without enough quarry stone."
"115740052-0-28330";"I know. I've had more time off than I'd like."
"115740052-0-28331";"Maybe I should go to the quarry myself. Better than sitting around all day."
"115740052-0-28332";"Borfree, now is not the time to take a break. Narsis will be out soon, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-28333";"Seryn and the outlander, their arguments have merit."
"115740052-0-28334";"For Chodala! For the Nerevarine!"
"115740052-0-28335";"Switch in 3… 2… 1!"
"115740052-0-28336";"I feel ready for the battlegrounds now!"
"115740052-0-28337";"Same! I can't wait to see which team we'll be on this time."
"115740052-0-28338";"Did you hear about the Egg Mine in Gnisis?"
"115740052-0-28339";"That they hatched a new queen?"
"115740052-0-28340";"No, not that. I heard they lost all the workers. Dead! All of them."
"115740052-0-28341";"That can't be true."
"115740052-0-28342";"Do you think those Ashlanders are still outside Molag Mar?"
"115740052-0-28343";"Of course they are. The Buoyant Armigers cleared them of all wrongdoing."
"115740052-0-28344";"Still, I pray to the Three that they move along soon."
"115740052-0-28345";"You worry too much."
"115740052-0-28346";"You there! Help! Destroy those Daedra before it's too late!"
"115740052-0-28347";"Keep killing them! The destabilized Daedric essence will reverse the energy flow!"
"115740052-0-28348";"A powerful presence is coming through! Be prepared!"
"115740052-0-28349";"The creature's death caused a change to the rift!"
"115740052-0-28350";"Someone must disrupt the rift, even—even if it means my life."
"115740052-0-28351";"Do you want me to die? You must complete the process quickly."
"115740052-0-28352";"Yes, exactly! Keep going!"
"115740052-0-28353";"You must start the process again! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-28354";"Wait! There has to be another way!"
"115740052-0-28355";"No, no! This cannot be my end!"
"115740052-0-28356";"I'm only alive because of your deeds. Thank you from stopping my foolish mistake."
"115740052-0-28357";"Leave me. I must recover my strength. Where did I go wrong? Perhaps if I look at my calculations once more."
"115740052-0-28358";"Wait! Don't shut me out! I have different songs I can sing! Think of the miners!"
"115740052-0-28359";"Is someone there? Please, help me! Down here!"
"115740052-0-28360";"Damned fanatics. They've no respect for the craft."
"115740052-0-28362";"I heard the Scarlet Judge was seen near the Dren estate. All the workers fled in fear."
"115740052-0-28363";"Wasn't that place taken over by bandits?"
"115740052-0-28364";"Who knows! The point is, the Scarlet Judge doesn't answer to anyone. Doesn't that bother you?"
"115740052-0-28365";"Most honest folks don't share your opinion."
"115740052-0-28366";"Just don't do anything stupid and you'll be fine. There's nothing to worry about."
"115740052-0-28367";"That's what worries me."
"115740052-0-28368";"The constructs are up to something. They're empowering that fabricant!"
"115740052-0-28369";"Hang on, Lord Vivec …."
"115740052-0-28370";"A few of you should get up here and deal with this."
"115740052-0-28371";"Aww, look at that. It's just a baby."
"115740052-0-28372";"There. Stand on those levitation sigils. I'll see you momentarily."
"115740052-0-28373";"You should go. Quickly. Use these Slowfall sigils. I'll be fine."
"115740052-0-28374";"Never seen liminal backlash of this magnitude. Marvelous."
"115740052-0-28375";"I can't believe Lord Vivec wouldn't see worshipers today."
"115740052-0-28376";"He's a Living God. I'm sure he was just busy. We should have waited longer."
"115740052-0-28377";"I know, but we're not getting any younger."
"115740052-0-28378";"We'll have a chance to see him again. Vivec City isn't that far away, you know."
"115740052-0-28379";"Canon Llevule must have really impressed Lord Vivec. He was promoted to Archcanon!"
"115740052-0-28380";"I heard Lord Vivec bestowed many favors that day. Even to an outlander!"
"115740052-0-28381";"I don't believe that. What outlander has ever done anything for us?"
"115740052-0-28382";"The Telvanni can't be happy these days."
"115740052-0-28383";"You're talking about that slave revolt?"
"115740052-0-28384";"Yeah. Their shipments have slowed down. A lot. I wonder what they'll do now."
"115740052-0-28385";"Sadly, this one thinks they will simply find more slaves."
"115740052-0-28386";"Suran's citizens must be frightened out of their minds! Some vigilante is running around and threatening people."
"115740052-0-28387";"The things that happen outside these towers never cease to amaze me."
"115740052-0-28388";"That vigilante better stay in Suran or he'll have our mages to contend with!"
"115740052-0-28389";"They're reviving fabricants! Highly unstable. Deal with them quickly!"
"115740052-0-28390";"Their systems are beyond taxed. Reforming their circuit could overload them entirely!"
"115740052-0-28391";"Interesting diorama they have in Vivec City."
"115740052-0-28392";"Yes, yes, most interesting. A miniature version of all of Vvardenfell, shown in great detail."
"115740052-0-28393";"I wonder if we could bring it here? Our mages are much better at discovering secrets than those glorified scholars working for the temple."
"115740052-0-28394";"I'm glad that this town sprung up around Tel Naga. It allows me to study some interesting things."
"115740052-0-28395";"Yes. The isolation of the island had made for many hours of uninterrupted study."
"115740052-0-28396";"If only there weren't so many outlanders wandering our streets."
"115740052-0-28397";"Ah, but some of these outlanders can teach us much. Observe them and take note. You'll understand."
"115740052-0-28398";"I don't have to go, you know. I can help clean things up around here. I know how to keep a low profile."
"115740052-0-28399";"This isn't up for debate. You're going."
"115740052-0-28400";"That's … remarkably unimpressive."
"115740052-0-28401";"Looks can be deceiving, my dear Vimy. This is our prize!"
"115740052-0-28402";"Hooray."
"115740052-0-28403";"Yet another Dwemer astrolabe. Unremarkable, I'm afraid."
"115740052-0-28404";"And worthless. Story of our lives."
"115740052-0-28405";"And there's a centurion head here … why?"
"115740052-0-28406";"Without the interior machinery, I'm afraid we're left to wonder."
"115740052-0-28407";"I do love wondering."
"115740052-0-28408";"Well, here's a gem. This coffer held something of special significance."
"115740052-0-28409";"Let me guess—you have no idea what it was, and it's gone now."
"115740052-0-28410";"Right on both counts."
"115740052-0-28412";"I wouldn't mind taking a look around this vault before we leave. Quite a trove we've discovered."
"115740052-0-28413";"Come to check up on me, hero?"
"115740052-0-28414";"House Telvanni still keeps slaves?"
"115740052-0-28415";"How else do those lazy mages accomplish anything?"
"115740052-0-28416";"But what about the Pact?"
"115740052-0-28417";"House Telvanni stayed out of the Pact. The wizards have no interest in mainland wars."
"115740052-0-28418";"I mean, why doesn't the Pact put a stop to it?"
"115740052-0-28419";"Would you like to tell the all-powerful mages to stop playing with their toys?"
"115740052-0-28420";"Sentry Alert"
"115740052-0-28422";"Over here! Don't let the hound see you!"
"115740052-0-28423";"Southern torsion clutch activated! Open that vault and destroy its defenses!"
"115740052-0-28424";"Good! Controls responsive now. Open the north vault and destroy its defenses."
"115740052-0-28425";"Well done! The final clutch is active. Open it and enter the energy reservoir!"
"115740052-0-28426";"Strange fluctuations ahead. Barbas is manipulating the energy reservoir! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-28427";"Daedric tricks! No matter. There's another path back the other way."
"115740052-0-28428";"The Mother Soul has blessed us both, outlander."
"115740052-0-28429";"Begone, meddling wizard!"
"115740052-0-28430";"Hello? Anyone home?"
"115740052-0-28431";"Kindle the fires of Red Mountain!"
"115740052-0-28432";"The mountain weeps its fiery tears for us. Tears of joy!"
"115740052-0-28433";"Red Mountain! Bathe us in your flames!"
"115740052-0-28434";"Eminently predictable, you and your lizard cohort."
"115740052-0-28435";"We emerge from Red Mountain's shadow. You should feel honored to witness it!"
"115740052-0-28436";"I'm quite sure you weren't invited up here. Off you go."
"115740052-0-28437";"A surge in the rift! On your guard!"
"115740052-0-28438";"The automata are reacting to it! Shut them down!"
"115740052-0-28439";"Have faith. My words are but a conduit for the truth. We follow in the steps of holy St. Alessia."
"115740052-0-28440";"Praise Vivec, his energy is restored!"
"115740052-0-28441";"Friends! Our Imperial blood is strong, and we can still see who our true allies are. We have come to remember and to inspire. Cyrodiil shall once more be free and victorious!"
"115740052-0-28442";"Shall we fear these foes set before us? No! As the Whitestrake clove the Elves asunder, so shall we drive our enemies from our land!"
"115740052-0-28443";"Daedra, she means. Metaphorical Elves, who are to us as the Ayleids were to our forebears!"
"115740052-0-28444";"It's rude to interrupt, Predicant."
"115740052-0-28445";"Emulating assassination tactics."
"115740052-0-28446";"Attrition countermeasures detected. Prioritizing damage control."
"115740052-0-28447";"Flame accelerants at saturation point. Exploiting."
"115740052-0-28448";"Magicka readings beyond current threshold. Matching output."
"115740052-0-28449";"Adapting to skirmishers. Harrying intruders."
"115740052-0-28450";"Probable stalemate. Adopting new tactics."
"115740052-0-28451";"Scan failed. Inputting from memory."
"115740052-0-28452";"Blessed Alessia, guided by the Divines themselves, conquered this land, and crushed the hedonistic Heartland Elves under her heel."
"115740052-0-28453";"Apologies, Your Reverence, but I've seen more than a few Elves around the garrison. Couldn't we moderate the tone of the sermon?"
"115740052-0-28454";"We praise the Whitestrake, who was never ""moderate."" And we speak to soldiers, who value loyalty, and who know that to distrust an Elf in Tamriel is simple common sense."
"115740052-0-28455";"Over here! Put your slaver's garb back on and get aboard."
"115740052-0-28456";"If you think you're being followed, find a place to hide. Good luck."
"115740052-0-28457";"My friend, over here!"
"115740052-0-28458";"Skaafin! They serve the Prince of Bargains. Keep them busy while I finish this."
"115740052-0-28459";"Like my new armor? I wanted to wear something special when I kill you."
"115740052-0-28460";"The energy arcing between those fabricants is strong. Enough to dissipate flesh … or melt metal."
"115740052-0-28461";"I almost have it, but that fabricant is still resonating with the rift. Destroy it! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-28462";"That energy is just like what was arcing between those fabricants before!"
"115740052-0-28463";"Oh, it's you. Sorry about that."
"115740052-0-28464";"Stay away from me, I'm warning you!"
"115740052-0-28465";"Come on! Stubborn, stupid lock …."
"115740052-0-28466";"I'll just take my leave. No use getting my axes bloody again."
"115740052-0-28467";"You bring this outlander to kill me, sister?"
"115740052-0-28468";"What is that? No matter. You are no longer worth my time."
"115740052-0-28469";"Well, you're not what I expected to find in a place like this."
"115740052-0-28470";"I can't wait to write this all down. To my camp, apprentice!"
"115740052-0-28471";"This expedition might make for my most exciting tale yet! That was probably Saint Veloth's mother!"
"115740052-0-28472";"Oh Narsis, that's wonderful news! I can't wait to read it!"
"115740052-0-28473";"That will have to wait. I must get to Vivec City. I'll leave it to you to compensate my trusty assistant."
"115740052-0-28474";"Hero, we really need to stop meeting like this!"
"115740052-0-28475";"<noverbal howling, screeching, and yelling in frustration>"
"115740052-0-28476";"What's with all the Redoran soldiers? Did something happen?"
"115740052-0-28477";"I wonder if it has something to do with the councilor's daughter? She's been missing for weeks now."
"115740052-0-28478";"Guard every exit. If Veya tries to get into or out of the city, we'll find her."
"115740052-0-28479";"The soldiers will find her. I heard she slaughtered everyone in the kinhouse. That girl was trouble from the time she was old enough to walk."
"115740052-0-28480";"Veya? Are you sure? I heard it was the Morag Tong. Had a writ from the House Hlaalu. It's obvious how much they want this city."
"115740052-0-28481";"Mortal, the Lady of Twilight has words for you!"
"115740052-0-28482";"Mage, this mortal speaks with the authority of the Mother Soul."
"115740052-0-28483";"Did you see who that was?"
"115740052-0-28484";"Hmm? No, who?"
"115740052-0-28485";"One of Divayth Fyr's recent planar expedition. Thought they'd never return."
"115740052-0-28486";"Don't be dramatic. You don't get to Master Fyr's age by being reckless."
"115740052-0-28487";"Tell that to my cousin. Said they were pulling bodies out of Tel Fyr in scores."
"115740052-0-28489";"Go on. I'll get her out of here before the council notices and meet you in Balmora."
"115740052-0-28490";"I need to do this alone. Now go. I'll see you in Balmora."
"115740052-0-28492";"Well done, outlander, well done!"
"115740052-0-28497";"Not again!"
"115740052-0-28499";"I see the ghosts are still on my land, Theyo, and here you are just standing around."
"115740052-0-28500";"So good of you to join us, Lord Thanlen. I'm sure your motivational presence won't be a distraction at all."
"115740052-0-28501";"Not good. These spirits are being drawn to where our wards need to be placed."
"115740052-0-28502";"It's done, but the spirit knows what we're up to. We need to hurry, before it decides to stop toying with us."
"115740052-0-28503";"More ghosts. They must be under the sway of the body shifter. He owns them, body and soul …."
"115740052-0-28504";"This evil has lingered here for a very long time … but have faith that the Old Gods power is far older."
"115740052-0-28505";"There! The last one! Clear the way and we'll be safe soon enough!"
"115740052-0-28506";"No! Touch the light! Set the ward! Ahhh!"
"115740052-0-28508";"Ah, you brought friends to the dance! Come in, come in! There's room for you all!"
"115740052-0-28511";"Allies on the enemy's back-line! Cover their approach!"
"115740052-0-28512";"It's tiring! Deliver the death blow!"
"115740052-0-28513";"The beast is down! Unbar the gate! Quickly! Let our friends inside!"
"115740052-0-28514";"You read my letter? Oh, I'm so grateful you've come!"
"115740052-0-28515";"We found something powerful. A Daedric—wait, what's happening?"
"115740052-0-28517";"Ysgramor's axe! You can beat them! Come! This way—"
"115740052-0-28518";"Thank you! See, we made it … just take it slow back over the rocks."
"115740052-0-28519";"We're free! The way is clear, we should run while we can!"
"115740052-0-28520";"Run? While our kin still claw at the rock for these curs? Never!"
"115740052-0-28521";"Nord blood was spilled for these weapons, but it won't be spilled by them! We fight!"
"115740052-0-28522";"We fight!"
"115740052-0-28523";"I can smell Reachman blood! Where are they?"
"115740052-0-28524";"Pah! All carved and bled like fattened calves …! Served up for Sovngarde!"
"115740052-0-28525";"Quick! Cut the others free, before this infernal thing wakes again to drink our blood!"
"115740052-0-28526";"Gurund didn't send you lot down from Sovngarde, I hope. We owe you."
"115740052-0-28527";"It'll never be done …! Not until every last Reachman has drawn their final breath."
"115740052-0-28529";"The living serve, but the dead obey. You will find no sanctuary in these halls!"
"115740052-0-28535";"The east and north gates won't hold much longer. I'll lead our people to safety. Buy me time. We'll fall back to the Halls of the Dead."
"115740052-0-28540";"Skaldir! No!"
"115740052-0-28541";"Damn it! Who's doing this? I'll send them straight to Sovngarde!"
"115740052-0-28542";"Your blood for the Hunt-Father! Your soul for Cernunnon!"
"115740052-0-28543";"They heed our calls! Our power is one!"
"115740052-0-28544";"Our bones lay deep in this land!"
"115740052-0-28550";"YOSEESOUND?"
"115740052-0-28551";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-28552";"That chill …."
"115740052-0-28554";"Help! Someone help me!"
"115740052-0-28555";"Now the Reach-dogs defile our honored dead! They are not beasts, they are vermin!"
"115740052-0-28556";"I will protect these people, but the draugr must be cleansed before they claim anymore lives."
"115740052-0-28557";"Ugh. I see you leering at me. On your way, or I'll call the guards."
"115740052-0-28559";"Easy does it, Neelo. It is me. What troubles you this time?"
"115740052-0-28562";"Egg-sister? What are you doing with that … that shadow tamer?"
"115740052-0-28563";"Do not be a withered root. This one means you no harm, and I am here to protect you now, all right? So lower your wards."
"115740052-0-28566";"I … yes, sister."
"115740052-0-28567";"Wake, little Jarl. See how your kingdom burns? Reap your vengeance."
"115740052-0-28568";"Usurpers …? In my hall! Let them come!"
"115740052-0-28569";"You, who would unravel the secret of these murderous shadows. Approach me."
"115740052-0-28570";"Wait! Don't leave yet!"
"115740052-0-28571";"Campfire on the beach …. I still don't see the appeal."
"115740052-0-28572";"Ah, you've arrived! Welcome to Dranil Kir. Let's get in out of the rain, shall we?"
"115740052-0-28573";"I trust you brought the items I requested. The scrying chamber is just up the hill. Follow me."
"115740052-0-28574";"The weather here is always poor. A side effect of the Obscuros's presence, I'm told. Come. It's just through here."
"115740052-0-28575";"I'm confident that the components you brought will fit, but the Obscuros device has been dormant for centuries."
"115740052-0-28576";"Let's hope that the genius of my forebears has stood the test of time. Affix the lantern and the lens. The answers we seek are … within our grasp."
"115740052-0-28577";"Do you feel that chill? It's like … oh no."
"115740052-0-28578";"What's happening to me?"
"115740052-0-28579";"You must …. kill the shadow. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-28580";"No! I will not perish here!"
"115740052-0-28581";"Slay them! I'll mend your wounds!"
"115740052-0-28582";"Victory at last."
"115740052-0-28583";"Set the lens and the lantern in the Obscuros. Time to see what this has all been about."
"115740052-0-28584";"A fabricant? I don't …."
"115740052-0-28589";"No, this cannot be. The city was sealed long ago."
"115740052-0-28590";"What is this creature? Some new Daedric beast?"
"115740052-0-28591";"The Clockwork City. Could it be, after all this time …?"
"115740052-0-28594";"I knew you were stubborn, but that won't save you from me! You'll die just like the rest!"
"115740052-0-28595";"You underestimated me, just like the rest! Now, this Psijic bitch is mine!"
"115740052-0-28596";"You were wise not to trust me, but that won't save you, or this Psijic bitch!"
"115740052-0-28597";"Poor, witless Bonafryd! That's what they called me! Well, who's laughing now, huh?"
"115740052-0-28598";"No! I will not fail my mistress!"
"115740052-0-28600";"The gate won't hold! All fire on that mammoth!"
"115740052-0-28601";"Torik, prepare them for what's to come. Stuhn watch over you."
"115740052-0-28602";"Yes, my Thane!"
"115740052-0-28605";"They're inside the walls!"
"115740052-0-28606";"They're coming! This way! Move!"
"115740052-0-28607";"I won't leave my home to burn! I can fight!"
"115740052-0-28608";"You can be slaughtered here, or make your stand with me at the Hall of the Dead. Choose."
"115740052-0-28609";"Wait! I'm with you!"
"115740052-0-28610";"I said to keep the fight out there! Oh, you aren't my guards. Nor are you Reachmen. We've won then?"
"115740052-0-28611";"Father! No …!"
"115740052-0-28612";"This hall. Is mine!"
"115740052-0-28613";"Falkreath burns! As will you!"
"115740052-0-28614";"My father … Jarl Skjoralmor is dead, but Falkreath lives another day."
"115740052-0-28615";"And so it shall so long as you stand for it, my Jarl."
"115740052-0-28616";"Jarl? So I am …."
"115740052-0-28617";"Then let it be known on this day that these warriors stand as my Thanes and their deeds shall be sung in my realm for generations to come."
"115740052-0-28618";"Long live Jarl Skjoralmor! Long live the saviors of Falkreath!"
"115740052-0-28619";"Hah!"
"115740052-0-28623";"Skeeving fetcher! I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-28626";"Dust aside, the equipment is in good order. We just need the vessel and we can begin."
"115740052-0-28627";"I have faith in Lord Seht's tenets: observe, learn, apply. Trust in his grand design."
"115740052-0-28628";"Yes … it's sublime, this … order."
"115740052-0-28629";"Y'ffre, I can feel! Thank you, I can feel …."
"115740052-0-28630";"Where did you hide it, you worm …?"
"115740052-0-28632";"Kyne's breezy hind! What a massacre!"
"115740052-0-28634";"Your flesh, your heart, your soul I'll rend!"
"115740052-0-28635";"There you are."
"115740052-0-28636";"I knew this wouldn't end well."
"115740052-0-28637";"Once again, the apostles are conducting a thorough inquiry, but this gathering is squandering resources."
"115740052-0-28638";"People want answers, Proctor!  Where is Sotha Sil?"
"115740052-0-28639";"I'm not here to speculate on Lord Seht's whereabouts. I'm here to clear the square."
"115740052-0-28640";"You don't know do you? I knew it. This is a disaster!"
"115740052-0-28641";"If you want to panic, do so in your own homes—not in the public square. Now disperse, or be dispersed."
"115740052-0-28642";"Get them moving."
"115740052-0-28643";"You heard the Proctor. Return to your homes."
"115740052-0-28644";"Damn it, Seht. Where are you?"
"115740052-0-28645";"Falkreath will fall …!"
"115740052-0-28646";"I recognize this place. These are the tunnels that lead to the Cogitum. Looks like the factotums put up a fight when the Shadow came through. Not enough it seems."
"115740052-0-28647";"There. The Shadow's ward."
"115740052-0-28648";"Liquid shadows? Some kind of Nocturnal blight. I've never seen the like."
"115740052-0-28649";"Wait. I remember …. Lord Seht taught me a spell long ago. He said it would guide me through the darkness one day. I couldn't find a use for it then, but now …."
"115740052-0-28650";"Yes. He said that logic and wisdom would part the shadows of doubt."
"115740052-0-28651";"It worked. How could he have known …? Never mind. Meet me at the entrance to the Cogitum. We have work to do."
"115740052-0-28653";"Faithful of Sotha Sil, you may enter to collect this year's harvest in a moment. But first, I shall name my new apprentice!"
"115740052-0-28655";"Hmm? Someone there?"
"115740052-0-28657";"This little scrapheap should do the trick …. Meet Snuffler, the tracking Nix."
"115740052-0-28659";"Whoa! Cool those cogs, you twitchy rascal!"
"115740052-0-28663";"My friends, the Wellspring enjoyed a bountiful harvest! Let me show you how we accomplish our miracles."
"115740052-0-28666";"<Roaring shout>"
"115740052-0-28671";"Simulated sunlight allows our trees to produce fruit sweeter than the orchards of Vvardenfell!"
"115740052-0-28672";"Ah, you've arrived at last. Come forward, we have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-28673";"Prepare if you must, but make it quick. Time is not on our side."
"115740052-0-28674";"Oy! Wake up, Joneif! Visitors! Bah—you're useless."
"115740052-0-28676";"These pipes carry an alchemical solution that nourishes our plants."
"115740052-0-28678";"We take clippings from the most robust plants to produce stronger varieties. Someday we'll be able to grow plants outside these walls!"
"115740052-0-28679";"Every season, we share our bounty and select a new apprentice from among the novice apostles. By the way, where did my new apprentice wander off to?"
"115740052-0-28680";"Sherizar? Oh, this one purrs at the sight of you!"
"115740052-0-28681";"It's so good to see you too, Chirrhari!"
"115740052-0-28682";"Who's …? Are you here to kill me? Too late. Your skeeving chancellor beat you to it."
"115740052-0-28683";"Factotums harvest the plants and pack them in special containers to keep them fresh before we distribute them to Clockwork City."
"115740052-0-28684";"Why do you resist? Your life force can feed thousands!"
"115740052-0-28685";"What in the …. This is not the Brass Fortress."
"115740052-0-28686";"Someone diverted our passage. Audacious, but foolhardy. When I find them I'll …. wait. I feel … cold."
"115740052-0-28687";"My shadow! My power! Don't let it escape!"
"115740052-0-28692";"Do your worst, night hag! You'll get nothing from me."
"115740052-0-28693";"Thank you. I'm … unaccustomed to being captured."
"115740052-0-28694";"A Shrike captain wouldn't defend just any gate. This must lead back to the city. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-28699";"<Deep whirring sniff noise - like a bloodhound getting a scent, then a buzzing ""ready to go, green light"" sound>"
"115740052-0-28708";"<mechanical ""yoo-hoo!"" noise, followed by dejected buzz seeing the player will not rejoin it.>"
"115740052-0-28709";"<mechanical ""Uh oh"" noise … followed by mechanical sniffing and an ""Uhhh"" noise as it tries to figure out what to do.>"
"115740052-0-28711";"<mechanical sniffing, followed by a ""wrong"" buzzer.>"
"115740052-0-28712";"You did well. Now return to the Clockwork City and let Daro know what you've learned."
"115740052-0-28713";"<mechanical sniffing, followed by happy chittering>"
"115740052-0-28714";"<Mechanical sniffing, followed by buzzing ""chitter-barks"" indicating that the fabricant has found its target.>"
"115740052-0-28715";"What?  Who's out there?"
"115740052-0-28716";"That machine! Is that the inductor? The apprentices … it sucked the life out of them!"
"115740052-0-28721";"Behold, the Clockwork City. Finally. Sotha Sil's Brass Fortress waits at the end of this road."
"115740052-0-28722";"We should go there at once. I'm keen to find out who sent us on that delightful jaunt through the Pneumatis."
"115740052-0-28723";"More important matters to attend to? Fine. Conclude your business quickly and meet me at the Brass Fortress."
"115740052-0-28724";"Father!"
"115740052-0-28725";"Hmm. Even draftier than I remembered. Follow me."
"115740052-0-28726";"Welcome to the Dwarven hold of Bamz-Amschend … such as it is. Ironic that Ayem's holy city of Mournhold has Dwemeric roots, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-28727";"Curious. Practically no one knows this route, but this scaffolding looks new. Built by rogue ordinators, perhaps? Stay watchful."
"115740052-0-28728";"This lift will take us to the nethermost depths of the ruin, and to our destination. Come along."
"115740052-0-28729";"On you go. The entrance lies just ahead."
"115740052-0-28730";"Do you see, just across the ravine? That's our door."
"115740052-0-28731";"I'd say prepare yourself, but nothing can prepare you for what's to come. Touch the sphere. The Clockwork City awaits."
"115740052-0-28732";"Well done. Killed by spinning knives is not an epitaph worthy of Divayth Fyr."
"115740052-0-28733";"Now, onward. I'm eager to see what new wind-up absurdities await us."
"115740052-0-28734";"I recognize this place now. The Pneumatic Forge. We should leave as soon as possible."
"115740052-0-28735";"Sotha Sil constructs his clockwork servitors here—the factotums. They reject anyone who doesn't belong. Someone meant for us to die here."
"115740052-0-28736";"At last! Defeat this monstrosity, but don't kill it. I must reclaim my power."
"115740052-0-28737";"Stand back. Time to reclaim what is mine."
"115740052-0-28738";"Maliad, khebeit tehir! Devahrokad sint molad!"
"115740052-0-28739";"Finally. You never know how much you miss a thing until it tries to kill you."
"115740052-0-28740";"More ridiculous machines? I've had enough of this!"
"115740052-0-28741";"Come. We still have a long way to go."
"115740052-0-28742";"Ugh. Remedial spellcraft is all I can muster, but I will aid you as best I can. Lead on."
"115740052-0-28743";"Luciana Pullo. Hospitable as ever. Go talk to her. I'll not waste my time speaking with a petulant toy soldier."
"115740052-0-28750";"Ready your weapons! I will assist you as best I can."
"115740052-0-28751";"Fetching scrapheaps …. My shadow remains close. We must hurry!"
"115740052-0-28752";"Factotums. They're activating!"
"115740052-0-28760";"There you are. Let's go. The only way into the Cogitum Centralis is this way."
"115740052-0-28761";"Just as I suspected. The defense system locked down the bridge. Slag it."
"115740052-0-28762";"I can use this terminal to unlock it, but the alarm cut the power. Looks like it has two charging junctions. I need you to find two core pumps. Can you do that?"
"115740052-0-28763";"One other thing. There's a master factotum down here called—."
"115740052-0-28764";"Greetings, I am Aios. Please be advised: the sacred Cogitum Centralis is currently sealed."
"115740052-0-28767";"I kindly encourage you to exit the Cogitum immediately. Thank you for your compliance."
"115740052-0-28768";"Not going to happen, Aios."
"115740052-0-28772";"That's the story of how the Everwound Wellspring was created. Lector Naril picked up where Sotha Sil left off."
"115740052-0-28773";"It's working! Try to find the second terminal."
"115740052-0-28774";"Well done. Now, all I need to do is … there. The bridge is clear."
"115740052-0-28775";"I disabled the emergency protocol. It won't shut down the core's defenses, but we shouldn't find our path blocked like this again."
"115740052-0-28776";"Admonition: many of Master Sil's defenses still conform to strongbox protocols. Risk of severe laceration, incineration, and or disintegration remains high."
"115740052-0-28777";"Go on, get out of here!"
"115740052-0-28778";"We go where we please, wingless!  Go away, or we peck out your eyes!"
"115740052-0-28779";"Eyes! Sweet, juicy eyes!"
"115740052-0-28780";"Such flavor!"
"115740052-0-28781";"Tender bits!"
"115740052-0-28782";"Vile beasts …."
"115740052-0-28783";"Is that—? No, thank goodness. The body is far too old. Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-28784";"Hmm. Decent hiding place, but no Lankin. We should keep looking."
"115740052-0-28785";"Another empty camp. Damn! He must be here somewhere!"
"115740052-0-28786";"Is that a pot on the stove? Someone was cooking … and recently. We must be close!"
"115740052-0-28787";"Finally! Come with us, Lankin. We're getting you out of here."
"115740052-0-28788";"More shadows. Even thicker than before. Damn."
"115740052-0-28789";"The shadow-banishing spell I used on the lift overtaxed my nerve-junctions. We need to find another way through."
"115740052-0-28790";"Try throwing that switch."
"115740052-0-28791";"I see something. Some kind of light burning away the corruption!"
"115740052-0-28792";"A lamp. Like the one you used to expose the Shadow!"
"115740052-0-28793";"When Sotha Sil saved me, he said I would shine a light one day. Could this be …? Questions for another time. Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-28794";"Quickly, follow me! The Planisphere is right through this door."
"115740052-0-28795";"Astronomer! I found someone who can help us."
"115740052-0-28796";"You've returned! Quickly now, give the star-scooper to the Astronomer."
"115740052-0-28797";"You're in for a real treat. Not many get to witness this!"
"115740052-0-28798";"Oh dear. That's not good. That's not good at all."
"115740052-0-28799";"Here they are! Let me just scoop them up."
"115740052-0-28800";"And now, watch this!"
"115740052-0-28801";"Oh right, they don't know where to go. If you can point out where they're supposed to be on the calibration guide, we can send them on their way."
"115740052-0-28802";"Let's see what these stars held. Just a moment, let me concentrate."
"115740052-0-28803";"Expertly done! Now, the star-scooper kept a record of what was inside those stars. Let's have a look, shall we?"
"115740052-0-28804";"Wait, was that the Astronomer? He was so young! And with hair! Not half bad looking either."
"115740052-0-28805";"Maybe the cultists want to learn how to perform the spell?"
"115740052-0-28806";"More shadows. Let's hope Sotha Sil had the foresight to install those lamps here too."
"115740052-0-28807";"Enough. I'm glad to see you weren't lying, Raynor Vanos."
"115740052-0-28808";"Intruder! Halt! Halt! Speak, or be pecked!"
"115740052-0-28809";"That bastard, Baldan, threw me into the Fundament!"
"115740052-0-28810";"Ridiculous. I've never seen this woman in my life."
"115740052-0-28811";"Liar! You tossed this one in as well!"
"115740052-0-28812";"Luciana, I'd like to ask the constable a few questions when we return to the Basilica."
"115740052-0-28813";"Don't trouble yourself, Varuni. You know how persuasive I can be."
"115740052-0-28814";"I do. That's what worries me."
"115740052-0-28815";"Do your worst, you tin-legged hag!"
"115740052-0-28816";"Seht help you if she does, constable."
"115740052-0-28817";"You'll regret this. Mark me, proctor. You will regret this!"
"115740052-0-28818";"I doubt that. Get this tarnished piece of scrap out of my sight."
"115740052-0-28819";"Enjoy prison, you skeeving prat!"
"115740052-0-28820";"Ah, it seems I arrived just in time."
"115740052-0-28821";"Kireth! Thank goodness! Don't suppose you found anything of interest down there …?"
"115740052-0-28822";"Well, I'd say that all worked out splendidly."
"115740052-0-28823";"There you are. Good. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-28824";"Divayth Fyr? Here? It is a true pleasure to meet you."
"115740052-0-28825";"I imagine it is. Now, be on your way."
"115740052-0-28826";"Yes … well. Be seeing you, assistant. Good day, Lord Fyr."
"115740052-0-28827";"Stand back while I make the necessary repairs. I should be done in but a moment."
"115740052-0-28828";"Now I just need to replace the crystal. Without causing irreversible damage. No problem."
"115740052-0-28829";"Tread carefully. Repair factotums are crawling all over this place, and they're determined to defend these halls."
"115740052-0-28832";"For a moment there I was worried that the factotums had whisked them all away. What a lucky find!"
"115740052-0-28833";"Excellent, this is just what the distillation initiator needs. I'm glad we could find one in such good condition."
"115740052-0-28834";"Yes, this certainly looks like the galvanic engine. That I'm going to fix now. Right now. Here I go!"
"115740052-0-28835";"All right, Baldan, I've got your gold. Will you sponsor me for citizenship?"
"115740052-0-28836";"Oh, I'll take your offering—but sponsorship? That's for the living, you tarnished scum."
"115740052-0-28837";"The living—what?"
"115740052-0-28838";"Do it."
"115740052-0-28839";"Well? What are you idling for? Gather up the gold and dump her with the others. We don't want anyone finding our latest visitor."
"115740052-0-28840";"Expertly done!"
"115740052-0-28841";"More oil. Excellent."
"115740052-0-28842";"One more and I think we've got it!"
"115740052-0-28843";"And that's the last of it. Excellent."
"115740052-0-28844";"Fyr? Where did you—? What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-28845";"Never mind where I came from! I'm keeping Sil alive, you ungrateful shrew! We can't let the shadow escape!"
"115740052-0-28846";"And just as I promised, my assistant arrives! You've brought a gift for our sponsor, right?"
"115740052-0-28847";"Even now, at the end, you bicker. How predictably mortal …."
"115740052-0-28848";"Why do you struggle so? Do you not see that it's hopeless? Sleep now … give in to the dark."
"115740052-0-28849";"Excellent, we have a strong signal. Now, to find Varuni's evidence."
"115740052-0-28850";"She's here! Nocturnal!"
"115740052-0-28851";"Wait … yes, go straight, then left. The central depository must be on a different floor."
"115740052-0-28852";"I'm seeing a lot of interference. Proceed carefully. We can't risk damaging the skeevaton's data collector."
"115740052-0-28853";"Expertly done. That grate should lead to the central depository—and our evidence!"
"115740052-0-28854";"This depository should contain security documents and recordings. Search everywhere. When you find something, use the skeevaton to make a remote copy."
"115740052-0-28855";"That's it! Quickly, assistant, direct the skeevaton to the exit, then meet me there to examine the evidence!"
"115740052-0-28856";"I can't hold it much longer! Get up, comrade! You have to turn the Skeleton Key! Now!"
"115740052-0-28857";"I … will not yield! Go, friend—do as Fyr says! Unlock the throne! Free Sotha Sil!"
"115740052-0-28858";"You trespass, Ur-dra. The Clockwork City shall bear your weight no longer."
"115740052-0-28859";"You achieve nothing, little godling. The Triad looms upon Summerset's shores. All that is shall be ours!"
"115740052-0-28862";"Well done, my friend. Enough theatrics, Luciana. On your feet.  Luciana …?"
"115740052-0-28863";"We should return to the surface. This is no place for mortals."
"115740052-0-28864";"Yes, this is perfect! My love will be so pleased."
"115740052-0-28865";"Who is this? Do you come to challenge the Knight of Marrow? Have at thee, featherless foe!"
"115740052-0-28866";"Another batch, spinning up. Destroy them!"
"115740052-0-28867";"More, to the southeast! Make ready!"
"115740052-0-28868";"This had better be the last of them!"
"115740052-0-28869";"Stewardship of my memories carries a high price, Orvas. One that you must pay willingly."
"115740052-0-28870";"I understand. I'd sacrifice anything to serve you, my lord."
"115740052-0-28871";"Wait. The sacrifice is … his memory?"
"115740052-0-28872";"So be it. I'll leave you the knowledge of this spell, to bestow upon your successor when the time comes."
"115740052-0-28873";"Of course, my lord, but … will it hurt?"
"115740052-0-28874";"You will not remember."
"115740052-0-28875";"No! It can't be!"
"115740052-0-28876";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-28877";"Now you know the truth. It is time."
"115740052-0-28878";"You never told me of this sacrifice! My life, yes, I'll give it. But my mind? My whole being?"
"115740052-0-28879";"Speak with her."
"115740052-0-28881";"Crowmother help me …."
"115740052-0-28882";"In the past, the Wellspring was accessible to everyone."
"115740052-0-28883";"Lector Naril sealed the place and started the tradition of the annual harvest and apprentice selection."
"115740052-0-28884";"Oh no. So many hopefuls! The gears just have to align in my favor. They have to!"
"115740052-0-28885";"I've decided. I'll become the next Astronomer. I give myself willingly, to serve the Chrononymic Will as it has seen fit."
"115740052-0-28886";"So be it. I'll start the process now. Take care of the Planisphere … and yourself as well, Amili."
"115740052-0-28887";"You remembered my … augh!"
"115740052-0-28888";"I can finally rest."
"115740052-0-28889";"What was I … oh, a visitor."
"115740052-0-28890";"I'm sorry, Astronomer. I just can't do it. I just can't give up who I am."
"115740052-0-28891";"I can better serve Lord Seht as myself. And I'll find someone to take my place, I swear it. Someone willing."
"115740052-0-28892";"So be it. You have made your choice, apostle. And now you will bear the consequence."
"115740052-0-28893";"Why, this blasted—I mean, no worries! I meant to do that."
"115740052-0-28895";"Some kind of tubular housing. Probably meant to protect a glass interior? Difficult to say."
"115740052-0-28897";"A complex filament of some kind. The weaving on this fiber … it must be machine-made. I should be taking notes."
"115740052-0-28898";"Look at the apertures on this. It must be some kind of modulator that changes the nature of the light. Fascinating!"
"115740052-0-28899";"Hmm … some kind of compressor. For funneling a gas perhaps? Interesting."
"115740052-0-28900";"Oh Duke, you came alone? Foolish. This may be easier than I thought. Show me the key, or my murder will tear you apart!"
"115740052-0-28901";"You are the fool, Chaff Queen! I wield the power of the machines now!"
"115740052-0-28902";"You expect me to believe that? Give me the key, or we will peck you to ribbons!"
"115740052-0-28903";"Behold!"
"115740052-0-28904";"What? Steady, Exarchs. It's just a trick."
"115740052-0-28905";"Awaken, machines! Awaken!"
"115740052-0-28906";"I will not be threatened! I am … I am the Queen of Chaff!"
"115740052-0-28907";"Your doom is nigh! My machines will destroy you!"
"115740052-0-28908";"No! Impossible! Impossible!"
"115740052-0-28909";"Now, Queen of Chaff, you will die!"
"115740052-0-28910";"I yield! Such power! Exarchs, to me! We leave this cursed place!"
"115740052-0-28911";"Ha! We did it, Featherless! Victory for the Duke! Victory for the Blackfeather Court!"
"115740052-0-28912";"Ugh, Bren! This stew tastes like it was steeped in rusty nuts. Maybe we should just stick to eating the paste. It's not so bad eating the same soft, bland mush every meal … forever …."
"115740052-0-28913";"Don't give up on me yet, Kaera! I think I'm getting close."
"115740052-0-28914";"Sherizar, the Everwound Wellspring welcomes you as its new apprentice! The rest of you? Come in and claim your portion of the harvest!"
"115740052-0-28916";"Thank the Great Gear! Let's go inside!"
"115740052-0-28918";"Did you say something about putting the lamp on the balcony? We might have a problem."
"115740052-0-28919";"The Skeleton Key, at last."
"115740052-0-28920";"<Test>"
"115740052-0-28921";"It's all right. Let it all out."
"115740052-0-28922";"Hey, you. Working with Brengolin. Come this way."
"115740052-0-28925";"The ventilation gear is stripped, just as I thought. We'll need to find a replacement if we want to make repairs."
"115740052-0-28927";"Ah-ha! The cleansing crystal is cracked, just as I suspected. We'll need to find a replacement."
"115740052-0-28928";"It-it worked? I mean, of course it worked! I knew what I was doing the entire time!"
"115740052-0-28929";"And this goes … here. And then of course this goes over here. And if I just put this here …."
"115740052-0-28930";"It's … it's fixed? It's fixed! Yes! My plan worked! The Clockwork Apostles will have to accept me now!"
"115740052-0-28931";"Of course, old friend. You seem troubled. More troubled than usual, I mean."
"115740052-0-28932";"Thank you both for coming."
"115740052-0-28933";"What's more, she does not act alone. A third enemy looms at the edge of my sight."
"115740052-0-28934";"Perceptive, as always. I do not wish to diminish your achievement, but Nocturnal's defeat here will be short-lived."
"115740052-0-28935";"Then we should inform the rest of the Psijics. They'll need to prepare."
"115740052-0-28936";"I will inform them personally. I have a separate task for you, Divayth."
"115740052-0-28937";"Their covetous eyes are now fixed on the Summerset Isles."
"115740052-0-28938";"Take the Skeleton Key. Keep it hidden for as long as you can. I trust that this task pleases you? After all, your love of such trinkets is what brought you here in the first place."
"115740052-0-28939";"Sometimes I wonder if you see too much. I will keep it safe."
"115740052-0-28940";"Farewell, Divayth Fyr. We will not meet again."
"115740052-0-28941";"I'll believe you when I see it. If you do pull it off, meet me in Slag Town."
"115740052-0-28942";"Stay back, my liege! Have at thee!"
"115740052-0-28943";"I haven't visited this memorial for centuries. But even I need reminders every now and again."
"115740052-0-28947";"You really are something. How'd you wind up in a dump like this?"
"115740052-0-28949";"I'll get out of here before you give it to him."
"115740052-0-28950";"Greetings, Apostles. It seems I must disrupt your labors yet again."
"115740052-0-28952";"My dear friend, Divayth Fyr, informed me that some of your number may be experimenting on my blessed factotums."
"115740052-0-28953";"I will remind you yet again—my beloved factotums serve as an extension of my divine will. Accost them, and you accost me."
"115740052-0-28954";"In the past, I have encouraged a child's curiosity and accepted minor blasphemies. But my generosity has limits."
"115740052-0-28955";"Know this—any servant of the Clockwork God found tinkering with factotums shall face severe sanction."
"115740052-0-28956";"In this place, my word shapes, constructs, and controls. My authority is absolute."
"115740052-0-28957";"Keep to your modest experiments. Seek discovery outside the walls or in the confines of your own cloisters."
"115740052-0-28958";"Such is the will of Seht—The Mainspring Ever-Wound. Obey."
"115740052-0-28959";"Now. Are there any questions?"
"115740052-0-28960";"I haven't the time to discuss this, Varuni. Wittingly or unwittingly Lord Seht no longer serves the people of Clockwork City. Now if you'll excuse me."
"115740052-0-28961";"Gascone, where are you going? When news of this gets out—. We need to issue a statement or at least gather the congress for an emergency session."
"115740052-0-28962";"I have urgent matters to attend to! Make whatever statement you like. I will … I will return soon."
"115740052-0-28963";"My dear Lord Seht … what happened to you?"
"115740052-0-28964";"Oh! Hey, friend! Was hoping to see you again!"
"115740052-0-28965";"All right, friends, the guest of honor has arrived! I've cooked up something special for you all. Soon to be favorites, I'm sure!"
"115740052-0-28966";"For you, Kaera, a mushroom-filtered meat stew. No more of that overwhelming metallic tang, I promise!"
"115740052-0-28967";"And for you, Maurice, Root Liqueur marinaded Fabri-Chop neatly braised. Soon to put Slag Town on the culinary map!"
"115740052-0-28968";"And finally, Tubabi, the crown jewel of my feast: hand-fed nix filets in a mushroom and root liqueur reduction."
"115740052-0-28969";"Slag it! Someone's breaching the Cogitum Centralis! I have to get back to the Basilica. Meet me there!"
"115740052-0-28970";"The omnivox alarm …."
"115740052-0-28971";"Take a breath and report. What's the situation in there?"
"115740052-0-28972";"Grim, Proctor. Daedric beasts and shadow cultists control much of the district. And the crows … the sky is thick with them!"
"115740052-0-28973";"This way, squire! Come! Come!"
"115740052-0-28974";"Varuni's auxiliary? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-28975";"No! Your metal woman is not allowed in Castle Blackfeather! I forbid it!"
"115740052-0-28976";"I don't want to go anywhere near your filthy castle, vermin. Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-28977";"My fair maiden of ruin! My heart swells to see you, like a dead cat's belly warmed by the sun."
"115740052-0-28978";"It's all true, my dearest love. I would feed you the flesh of a thousand burnt carcasses, if you would only give me the chance …."
"115740052-0-28979";"My passions burn with forbidden desire …."
"115740052-0-28980";"Love, given cruel voice by … the charred flesh of my enemies?"
"115740052-0-28982";"Charred flesh? Burning passions?"
"115740052-0-28983";"Of course, sir knight! How could I refuse such honeyed words? I feel a swoon coming on!"
"115740052-0-28984";"She said yes! I owe you a debt, crow-friend. Duke! Duke, may I present the featherless poet."
"115740052-0-28986";"And for my newest friend, I have a special treat!"
"115740052-0-28990";"A fragmented memory of Lord Seht speaking to someone. This must have been what the cultists were looking for."
"115740052-0-28991";"A reckoning is upon us!"
"115740052-0-28992";"Even my memory."
"115740052-0-28993";"Lector Naril's a Clockwork Apostle. He must keep meticulous notes. We need to examine them."
"115740052-0-28994";"You lash out because you fail to grasp the importance of what I do!"
"115740052-0-28995";"We've collected all the memory fragments we need. Let's head back to the planisphere's center so we can watch the whole thing."
"115740052-0-28996";"That doesn't sound very good. What happened in this memory?"
"115740052-0-28998";"Take the Shinies!"
"115740052-0-28999";"It appears as though we make a rather good team."
"115740052-0-29000";"You have to be careful with these. It's easy to overwrite the memories with your own."
"115740052-0-29001";"Keep your sword-arm wound tight. Daedra could still be lurking around here."
"115740052-0-29003";"My Knight! No!"
"115740052-0-29004";"New apprentice, if you can hear my voice, step to the nearest speaking tube this instant."
"115740052-0-29005";"You summon me again? I grow tired of this, mortal!"
"115740052-0-29006";"I'm very disappointed, Sherizar. Stop this foolishness and return to me this instant."
"115740052-0-29007";"New apprentice, step to the nearest speaking tube immediately. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-29011";"The early experiments failed, even though Lector Naril perfected his alchemical solution. I wonder how they solved the problem?"
"115740052-0-29012";"I never knew what went into making the Wellspring work. I wonder how they finally got the simulated sunlight to nourish the plants?"
"115740052-0-29013";"The source of the simulated sunlight is the life force of the missing apprentices? That's horrible! We need to see what's inside Naril's private workshop!"
"115740052-0-29014";"So now you know the secret of the Wellspring. You see your role in our grand plan."
"115740052-0-29015";"Time is short. The life force of the previous apprentices is nearly depleted."
"115740052-0-29016";"Integral of memory detected! Would you be so kind as to insert it into my forehead ridge?"
"115740052-0-29017";"The farthest slot to the left, please. Your left, not mine."
"115740052-0-29018";"Apostle, I have remembered something! Come quickly, before it rusts!"
"115740052-0-29019";"<mechanical ""bwah bwah"" noise, followed by a buzzing ""let's go"" noise.>"
"115740052-0-29020";"Lector Trivura! Thank you for coming. It's been too long."
"115740052-0-29021";"Perhaps. This auxiliary tells me you've reconstructed a factotum?"
"115740052-0-29022";"Yes, right here. It's almost emerged from liminality."
"115740052-0-29023";"Fascinating. How did you manage to refactor the subjectivity lacework? Did you construct a locus amoenus to stabilize it?"
"115740052-0-29024";"Back, creature!"
"115740052-0-29025";"I, ah, the factotum has a record of all the operations I made. I'm afraid I was in something of a trance. Possibly divine inspiration!"
"115740052-0-29026";"Possibly."
"115740052-0-29027";"The reconditioning is complete. May I present my finest work, the Precursor!"
"115740052-0-29028";"What a relief to be in one piece again. And you've fixed my nagging elbow joint! Bravo, apostle, bravo."
"115740052-0-29029";"Oh Divine Metronome, why do you test me so?"
"115740052-0-29030";"Why, an addition to our party! Forgive my rudeness, apostle. You may call me the Precursor."
"115740052-0-29031";"I know what you are, pendulate. The holy text calls you the Oscillating Son."
"115740052-0-29032";"I'm afraid the texts are a tad inaccurate then. Sotha Sil did not create me with a gender in mind."
"115740052-0-29033";"Silence, blasphemer! They speak of a fractured creation of Lord Seht, discarded in the First Era. Left with the knowledge to rebuild itself only to test his pupils."
"115740052-0-29034";"Fractured? Discarded? I'm just a tad old is all! I'm sure this is just a mistake."
"115740052-0-29035";"Your only purpose is to convince unworthy apostles to rebuild you. Any child could complete such a task."
"115740052-0-29036";"But Lector, it's not as simple as you say! I learned much from working on this factotum. My research has been advanced tenfold."
"115740052-0-29037";"If you developed the skill of contemplation instead of mere tinkering, perhaps you would know better, Zanon. Speak to me when you've done so. And dismantle that thing."
"115740052-0-29038";"Excuse me? Dismantle? Why I never!"
"115740052-0-29039";"Lector, please don't go! I still don't understand what you want from me!"
"115740052-0-29040";"But apostle, what of me?"
"115740052-0-29041";"You can go jump in a recycling furnace for all I care!"
"115740052-0-29042";"How rude!"
"115740052-0-29043";"How dare you, Kamid! Your mother wanted a better future for you!"
"115740052-0-29044";"Because a factotum with delusions of grandeur told her fortune? Do you really believe that?"
"115740052-0-29045";"She believed it. Why can't you see—"
"115740052-0-29046";"See what? That following the predictions of a deluded machine got my mother killed? I'll prove the Prognosticator is a fraud, see if I don't!"
"115740052-0-29050";"Raynor, you let him walk all over you! There's a difference between cordial and compliant!"
"115740052-0-29051";"You told me to play nice with others! Now you complain? I don't have to listen to this. I'll finish exploring on my own!"
"115740052-0-29054";"By Tu'whacca's breath, you will talk to me!"
"115740052-0-29055";"Say something, damn it!"
"115740052-0-29056";"Enough talk, you horn-capped buffoon! Just help me!"
"115740052-0-29057";"How did you …? I yield! Just follow me outside, all right? I promise, I will explain everything."
"115740052-0-29058";"The Resonant Sphere. One of Sotha Sil's minor marvels!"
"115740052-0-29059";"There! Did you hear it! The same tone that the central spire emits during the night cycle."
"115740052-0-29060";"Let me tell you what I discovered before we move on."
"115740052-0-29061";"Be careful in the Vale. It's dangerous down there."
"115740052-0-29062";"That's close enough. Don't want to disturb the, ah, wildlife."
"115740052-0-29063";"Those machines must be pumps! For moving the lubricant throughout the Clockwork City. Fascinating!"
"115740052-0-29064";"I have what I need. We're done here."
"115740052-0-29065";"I saw this from a distance and was instantly intrigued."
"115740052-0-29066";"There's no rhyme or reason to its function, at least none that I can ascertain."
"115740052-0-29067";"Maybe one day I can return with an entire team. For now, let's move on."
"115740052-0-29068";"There you are! I was worried sick about you."
"115740052-0-29069";"Kireth … I … well … I'm sorry. I shouldn't have stormed off like that. I blame all this metal. I think I'm getting a rash."
"115740052-0-29070";"I'm sorry, too. I said some things that were uncalled for. Unfair. That Neramo just makes my skin crawl, you know?"
"115740052-0-29071";"It's the way he talks. Humongous words and a superior attitude."
"115740052-0-29072";"Sounds like someone else I know. Now come on and tell me what you discovered."
"115740052-0-29073";"Kireth, I have something to say to you. I'm your older brother and I'm a genius. I deserve better than to be scolded as though I were a spoiled child!"
"115740052-0-29074";"Oh, you do, do you? And is this you not acting like a spoiled child?"
"115740052-0-29075";"There! You did it again! That's just mean. Partners don't treat each other that way, or at least they're not supposed to."
"115740052-0-29076";"About time! I'm proud of you, big brother, finally standing up for yourself! That's what I've been telling you to do all along."
"115740052-0-29077";"You … well, I mean, what did you expect? I always take your advice to heart. We are partners, after all."
"115740052-0-29078";"Follow me! The word-vault is this way. This way!"
"115740052-0-29081";"Here we are! The word vault lies behind that door. I shall perch here and await your swift return!"
"115740052-0-29082";"Factotum beacon activated. Initiating security protocols."
"115740052-0-29083";"The gates! I'm safe."
"115740052-0-29084";"Chancellor Gascone!"
"115740052-0-29085";"Oh no. Luciana, I know what this looks like, just-"
"115740052-0-29086";"Shut that lying mouth of yours or I'll shut it for you. Permanently."
"115740052-0-29087";"Thank you for digging this traitorous mongrel out of the Terminus. Varuni wants to speak with you back at the basilica."
"115740052-0-29088";"Divayth Fyr! I warned you never to come back!"
"115740052-0-29089";"And you? One of Fyr's lackeys, I take it?"
"115740052-0-29090";"Tread carefully, Fyr. I'll be watching."
"115740052-0-29091";"Behold, Blackfeathers! Our giant prepares to destroy the Guardian!"
"115740052-0-29093";"Shh! There it is! The Motionless Guardian! Strike true, crow-friend!"
"115740052-0-29094";"Tremble Guardian! Our giant approaches!"
"115740052-0-29099";"Victory! Victory for the Court! Now, let us take wing, Blackfeathers. Back to the Duke!"
"115740052-0-29100";"I just don't know. I always expected Clockwork City to be a bit more … hospitable."
"115740052-0-29101";"We need not the grease of luxury to find our sequence here."
"115740052-0-29102";"Still, you never tire of it? The smell of oil, or the taste of gruel?"
"115740052-0-29103";"Your mind must become a gear, a single constant, winding in perfect regulation. Do not let such thoughts rust your mind."
"115740052-0-29104";"That's true, I suppose. No use crying over spilt milk. Hmm. Milk."
"115740052-0-29105";"I haven't seen Sotha Sil yet. Does he ever come out?"
"115740052-0-29106";"He concerns himself with the Divine Metronome, beyond simple understanding, unheeding of the line-motion so many tread upon."
"115740052-0-29107";"But shouldn't he help look after the city he created?"
"115740052-0-29108";"In silence we are given mysteries. From mysteries is born curiosity. We must assemble our own truths, lest we forget its importance, its purpose."
"115740052-0-29109";"Huh. Well, I guess he would be pretty busy, being a god and all."
"115740052-0-29110";"Will I have to get metal arms now?"
"115740052-0-29111";"Modifications are extensions of the truth of your soul, a gift to those who seek the unending quest of cohesion. Water-tight and everlasting."
"115740052-0-29113";"I'll take that to mean they're optional, then. Thanks."
"115740052-0-29115";"Were you able to find an animo core?"
"115740052-0-29116";"Initializing … reflecting … reflecting … memory engaged. By the will of Seht, please state your query."
"115740052-0-29117";"It worked! Prognosticator, tell me what the fates have in store for Kamid of Slag Town."
"115740052-0-29119";"Reflecting … charting possible outcomes. Kamid of Slag Town, minimum income, inferior quality of life …."
"115740052-0-29120";"Great, you know all about me. But what does it mean? What's my future, you stupid construct?"
"115740052-0-29121";"Query … reflecting …. Prognostication unsatisfactory. Poor quality of life will lead to sickness, starvation, depression, and ultimately … death."
"115740052-0-29122";"Perfectly dire, just what I expected. And what about my friend here?"
"115740052-0-29123";"Reflecting, reflecting …. No relevant data in memory vaults …. Error occurred. Please present yourself for immediate data collection."
"115740052-0-29124";"Factotums will continue to gather the harvest and bring the containers here. In the meantime, use the lift and come see our oasis!"
"115740052-0-29125";"Are you sure about this, Kamid? Remember what happened to your mother."
"115740052-0-29126";"With the outsider's help, that treasure is as good as mine. Then everyone will see that the Prognosticator is a fraud!"
"115740052-0-29127";"So, you found a way in after all. Impressive. Too bad it's a dead end. Unless you can smash through solid bedrock, you'll never find me."
"115740052-0-29128";"What … what have you done?"
"115740052-0-29129";"Slag that Imperfect, and kill the interloper! They're getting too close!"
"115740052-0-29130";"Oh, did your new toy wind down? What a shame! May as well give up!"
"115740052-0-29132";"You don't understand, I had to do this. You are ruining everything!"
"115740052-0-29134";"Once we arrive at the basilica I can explain everything to Varuni. Maybe she'll understand."
"115740052-0-29137";"Oh no. Luciana, just let me expla-"
"115740052-0-29138";"Friend Kireth! Bright moons above! Please, let's leave this dungy place!"
"115740052-0-29139";"People of Slag Town! I bring you a revelation!"
"115740052-0-29140";"The Prognosticator lies! But we can change our fortunes, we have free will!"
"115740052-0-29141";"Kamid, the apostles say there's no such thing as free will!"
"115740052-0-29142";"What you're implying is heresy, Kamid!"
"115740052-0-29143";"Is it heresy to speak the truth? I performed the pilgrimage. I received the usual grim fortune that predicted I'd be poor until I died."
"115740052-0-29144";"But that future is a false future! I refused to accept that fate and I changed it! And if I can do it, so can you!"
"115740052-0-29145";"Oh really? You look just as destitute as you did yesterday, Kamid. Maybe even more so!"
"115740052-0-29146";"I found the lost treasure of the Radius! I made a deal to sell some of the spices and this is the contract. I'm rich!"
"115740052-0-29147";"What? How is that possible? The Grand Prognosticator said—"
"115740052-0-29149";"So we can change our fate? The future isn't a set sequence?"
"115740052-0-29150";"We have to tell everyone! Kamid changed the future! The Prognosticator was … wrong!"
"115740052-0-29151";"Take him away."
"115740052-0-29152";"Sergeant Baldan! This one has the gold you requested! Will you still sponsor me?"
"115740052-0-29153";"I gave you my word, didn't I? Come, cat. We can discuss the specifics in my office."
"115740052-0-29154";"A thousand blessings, walker! Lankin has much to offer the Brass Fortress!"
"115740052-0-29155";"Yes, I'm sure you do."
"115740052-0-29159";"Good thing I made him fireproof."
"115740052-0-29160";"I'll wait for you here. I've chased enough birds for one day."
"115740052-0-29161";"Another gate. Damn. We've got to find the release!"
"115740052-0-29169";"Can I borrow your notes on yesterday's lesson? I'd like to … conduct a comparison."
"115740052-0-29170";"You're cranked if you think I'll do that, given you slept all through the lesson."
"115740052-0-29173";"I wasn't sleeping! Simply meditating on the possibilities of-of …."
"115740052-0-29174";"The implications of thermal reactions of geodic distillate in high-pressure conditions."
"115740052-0-29175";"Yes, that! Exactly!"
"115740052-0-29176";"You'll end up a shopkeeper if you keep this laziness up."
"115740052-0-29177";"Hey now, there's no need to be rude!"
"115740052-0-29178";"I think owning a shop is a fine trade."
"115740052-0-29179";"Oh, I'm sure it is. It's just not what the Chrononymic Will has in plan for me."
"115740052-0-29180";"Don't tell me you went down to Slag Town."
"115740052-0-29181";"Oh come now, there's no harm in the occasional visit. You'd be surprised by the types of things you can buy down there."
"115740052-0-29182";"You're being ridiculous! Winding, tell him he's being ridiculous!"
"115740052-0-29183";"I, well. Yes. I suppose it's a little silly."
"115740052-0-29184";"See? Even Winding thinks you're cranked!"
"115740052-0-29185";"I heard that Amili was chosen to go to the Mnemonic Planisphere."
"115740052-0-29186";"Amili? Are you quite sure? She couldn't go a day without telling a bad joke."
"115740052-0-29187";"I'm positive. To think someone as cranked as her got such a position …."
"115740052-0-29188";"Amili was always very attentive in our lessons together."
"115740052-0-29189";"Oh, I'm sure she was. But such a position deserves someone a tad more … regulated."
"115740052-0-29190";"Do you believe we'll be able to see the Mnemonic Planisphere one day?"
"115740052-0-29191";"One day? I'm surprised we haven't already been invited to go."
"115740052-0-29192";"Imagine what we could learn from the memories of Sotha Sil himself!"
"115740052-0-29193";"Well, hopefully you won't just sleep through them all, brother dearest."
"115740052-0-29194";"They gave out gruel today for lunch. Isn't it time for the harvest?"
"115740052-0-29195";"Perhaps it is better this way. I have heard rumors as of late."
"115740052-0-29196";"You? Why, you've never been one for idle gossip. What did you hear?"
"115740052-0-29197";"I only know whispers …. Let us just be grateful for what we have."
"115740052-0-29198";"The harvest this year is delicious as always!"
"115740052-0-29199";"Quite the welcome change from our daily gruel."
"115740052-0-29200";"I have heard whispers though …."
"115740052-0-29201";"We've all heard the whispers, Winding. Best to be grateful and leave the rest to Lord Seht."
"115740052-0-29202";"Yes, of course. I apologize."
"115740052-0-29203";"You have no right to treat me like this! I'm a member of House Hlaalu, and I demand to speak to … to … to someone!"
"115740052-0-29204";"Your … house? Ah, yes, I remember. The Great Houses. The antiquated hierarchy of authority, which the Dark Elves chained themselves with."
"115740052-0-29205";"What? I won't take this disrespect! Show me to someone of authority! Now!"
"115740052-0-29206";"Do you truly believe that is the way of things here?"
"115740052-0-29207";"There must be some sort of mistake. I'm not meant to be here."
"115740052-0-29208";"Your path has been set before you, auxiliary. I suggest you learn to walk it."
"115740052-0-29209";"What nonsense are you spouting? Just tell me how to go back! I demand it!"
"115740052-0-29210";"Choice is but chaos. Demands but the selfish needs of those who would follow the Motion of Lines."
"115740052-0-29211";"Everyone in this place is fetching mad!"
"115740052-0-29212";"I have important business back in Vvardenfell. I can't be late! I need to leave!"
"115740052-0-29213";"""Forward!"" it cries! ""Forward to the fruits of cheap ambition! Forward to the promise of everlasting kingdoms!"""
"115740052-0-29214";"Will you stop mocking me?!"
"115740052-0-29215";"It's all right, we'll help take care of you."
"115740052-0-29216";"This one doesn't know what he'll do. Where will he go?"
"115740052-0-29217";"You will see, my dear. We take care of our own down here."
"115740052-0-29218";"Now apostles, they're easy targets. They'd lose their head if it wasn't attached!"
"115740052-0-29219";"But watch they do not catch you! Be as the smoke, there and gone."
"115740052-0-29220";"This one has dealt with the Telvanni. He knows how to keep out of sight."
"115740052-0-29221";"Misanir does not understand. Khajiit? Argonians? They are apostles as well?"
"115740052-0-29222";"Well, they take anyone, don't they?"
"115740052-0-29223";"It does not matter who one is, but what they can do."
"115740052-0-29224";"Not that it does us any good, mind you. We're all scrap down in Slag Town."
"115740052-0-29225";"The water Misanir has seen around the city has been …."
"115740052-0-29226";"Oh, don't worry about that! The Halls of Regulation cleans it right up."
"115740052-0-29227";"Clear water comes to the city, given to all equally. Even us."
"115740052-0-29228";"Right! We'd really be cranked up if that place broke down."
"115740052-0-29229";"The water, oh, the water! Whatever will we do?"
"115740052-0-29230";"Now, you calm yourself right down. They're just rumors!"
"115740052-0-29231";"What is wrong with the water?"
"115740052-0-29232";"She just heard that the Halls of Regulation were breaking down. Tusking lies if you ask me."
"115740052-0-29233";"What will we do, what will we do …?"
"115740052-0-29234";"What is that? What's happening?"
"115740052-0-29235";"After him! Someone seize that imposter!"
"115740052-0-29237";"Arrrgh!"
"115740052-0-29238";"Lulgra, Ei-Jahz. This one is confused."
"115740052-0-29239";"The Cogitum shifted into its strongbox configuration as soon as the alarm sounded. So now we have to contend with inaccessible platforms, hostile factotums, unleashed fabricants …."
"115740052-0-29240";"Sotha Sil prepares for every conceivable eventuality, but the Shadow is Sotha Sil. It's difficult to create countermeasures for yourself."
"115740052-0-29241";"We can't count on Sotha Sil. This task falls to us."
"115740052-0-29242";"How horrible! Those apostles … all dead!"
"115740052-0-29243";"Not just dead. Drained of life to create the simulated sunlight."
"115740052-0-29244";"Still, it's an amazing device. Lector Naril's a true genius."
"115740052-0-29246";"What part of sealed don't you understand? The Shadow put a hex on the lift. Perhaps if we had the key you managed to lose …."
"115740052-0-29247";"Here we go again. I told you before, Lord Seht would never allow the Skeleton Key to enter the city. There must be another explanation."
"115740052-0-29248";"Well, by all means, explain it to me. Just be sure to use small words. I wouldn't want you to strain yourself."
"115740052-0-29251";"A genius? Look at this! Naril's insane!"
"115740052-0-29253";"Warning! Daedric contamination detected in the throne room. Total system failure imminent."
"115740052-0-29254";"Thick-legged filth! We'll peck your eyes out!"
"115740052-0-29255";"Prepare to die, you featherless scum!"
"115740052-0-29256";"Take one step closer! We dare you!"
"115740052-0-29257";"Agh! Its arms will be the death of us! Fly! Fly!"
"115740052-0-29258";"Retreat! Retreat!"
"115740052-0-29259";"Why do you always dare them? Fly, fools!"
"115740052-0-29260";"Approach, poet! Let me get the measure of you."
"115740052-0-29261";"A brass lily nods … under gentle showers"
"115740052-0-29262";"Its shiny petals polished under a rain of kisses …."
"115740052-0-29263";"Rain? No rain! It crinkles my feathers!"
"115740052-0-29264";"Oh! Not real rain! A rain of … entrails! Yes! Tasty entrails!"
"115740052-0-29265";"Entrails? Oh, Sir Knight, you know the way to my heart goes through my gullet. Bring me entrails and I shall share with you … maybe."
"115740052-0-29266";"Your merits, uh … defy calculation?"
"115740052-0-29267";"My pelvic bracket pumps like a piston …. Oh, that's not right!"
"115740052-0-29268";"And your face! Your face looks symesital …? Symetical? It looks shiny! So shiny!"
"115740052-0-29269";"What? Is this some kind of featherless joke?"
"115740052-0-29270";"Sir Knight, that was … unique. So mysterious! I like your face too. Join me on the treasure-heap some time!"
"115740052-0-29271";"Their giant felled the Guardian! Fly, Exarchs! Fly!"
"115740052-0-29272";"Naril's dead, but the promise of the Wellspring lives on."
"115740052-0-29273";"You're not suggesting we continue to … to kill people?"
"115740052-0-29274";"We call for volunteers. Use their sacrifices while we continue to work on finding a different source of power."
"115740052-0-29275";"How noble. I assume we won't be the ones volunteering this time?"
"115740052-0-29276";"Sherizar has the right idea. And I offer myself as the first sacrifice."
"115740052-0-29277";"Idrono, no!"
"115740052-0-29278";"It's only logical. I'm an apprentice whose experiments never worked out. Allow me to contribute in another way."
"115740052-0-29279";"Very well. Let's go make the necessary preparations."
"115740052-0-29280";"One death … to avoid many. This one still doesn't like how this all turned out."
"115740052-0-29281";"Naril's dead. And this work is an affront to Lord Seht and everything he's taught us."
"115740052-0-29282";"I won't argue that point, but you can't deny that Naril accomplished what the Clockwork Mage never quite got around to doing."
"115740052-0-29283";"This one rejects that path! A life is worth more than a harvest. More than a hundred harvests!"
"115740052-0-29284";"This isn't our decision to make. We should go before the council."
"115740052-0-29285";"No, there's no decision to make. I'm shutting this horrid contraption down right now."
"115740052-0-29286";"But the plants! They'll die without the simulated sunlight!"
"115740052-0-29287";"We're the apprentices of the Everwound Wellspring! We'll figure out a way to save the plants."
"115740052-0-29288";"You really think so? This one hopes that we are up to such a task."
"115740052-0-29289";"We're Clockwork Apostles! Of course we can do this. Now, let's get to work."
"115740052-0-29290";"And when a customer enters the store? What do we say?"
"115740052-0-29291";"Welcome, citizen."
"115740052-0-29292";"Good! And when they ask how much something is? What do we say then?"
"115740052-0-29293";"Cease your actions, or you will be taken into custody."
"115740052-0-29294";"Shor's bones …."
"115740052-0-29295";"All right, you pile of bolts, lets run through it one more time."
"115740052-0-29296";"What am I running through?"
"115740052-0-29297";"Inventory of course."
"115740052-0-29298";"Understood. I will run through the inventory."
"115740052-0-29299";"Sovngarde take me now."
"115740052-0-29300";"Just do as I say, you skeever!"
"115740052-0-29301";"Reflecting … reflecting …."
"115740052-0-29302";"Wait, what are you doing now?"
"115740052-0-29303";"I am a factotum, not a large rodent, citizen."
"115740052-0-29304";"What?"
"115740052-0-29305";"A skeever is a large rodent. I am not a large rodent."
"115740052-0-29306";"Can you fix it?"
"115740052-0-29307";"Well, I wouldn't say it's broke. It's performing as originally functioned."
"115740052-0-29308";"I don't need a guard factotum, I need a shop assistant!"
"115740052-0-29309";"There's not much I can do …."
"115740052-0-29310";"And if I could offer some funding for your research?"
"115740052-0-29311";"Perhaps there's something I can do."
"115740052-0-29312";"You said you'd get results, Zanon."
"115740052-0-29313";"I know! I know! But I've been considering changing my field of research lately."
"115740052-0-29314";"Truly? Well then I'll be needing my generous donation back."
"115740052-0-29315";"Oh, well, about those funds, you see, well …."
"115740052-0-29316";"You best start running, Zanon. Before I stick this scrap heap on your arse."
"115740052-0-29318";"Daedric threat detected."
"115740052-0-29319";"I already told you, you piece of scrap. Ain't no Daedra in Clockwork."
"115740052-0-29320";"Daedric threat detected in Clockwork City."
"115740052-0-29321";"Shut your metal trap before I sell you for parts."
"115740052-0-29322";"Daedric threat no longer detected."
"115740052-0-29323";"This again? I told you, ain't no Daedra in Clockwork!"
"115740052-0-29324";"Correct. There is no longer a Daedric threat in Clockwork City."
"115740052-0-29325";"Ain't ever a threat to begin with! Oh, you test my last nerve, you do."
"115740052-0-29326";"Are there usually this many crows around?"
"115740052-0-29327";"Not generally, no."
"115740052-0-29328";"Huh. That's it? No verse about the wheels Eternal or speaking the words of Making?"
"115740052-0-29329";"Do you seek my wisdom so fervently?"
"115740052-0-29330";"No, no, just curious is all. Huh."
"115740052-0-29331";"What was that? An alarm? Why was there an alarm?"
"115740052-0-29332";"The omnivox alarm. Seht help us all."
"115740052-0-29333";"We're not in danger, are we? Are we?"
"115740052-0-29334";"Come, we must seek the Council. Before it is too late."
"115740052-0-29335";"You won't even hold a discussion? Seht didn't teach us to discard knowledge whenever it proves inconvenient."
"115740052-0-29336";"Even Sotha Sil abandoned those experiments. For good reason."
"115740052-0-29337";"He never forbade them. We did. That was a mistake."
"115740052-0-29338";"The only one who is choosing to see what they want to see here is you. Find your answers elsewhere, Sovor."
"115740052-0-29339";"You expect me to believe this is Sovor? It's an elaborate ruse, to your credit."
"115740052-0-29340";"Skepticism is an appropriate reaction, but do not dismiss Terari as we did so long ago. Her theories are sound."
"115740052-0-29341";"I didn't do this to get in the order's good graces. I didn't even do it because he begged me to. This is pointless, Sovor."
"115740052-0-29342";"Stop calling it that. Proctor Saryoni was a troubled man, but I won't have you defaming his name with your heresies."
"115740052-0-29343";"It wasn't until death cast its shadow over my flesh that I saw the true beauty of brass. Do not wait too long to open your eyes, Llornil."
"115740052-0-29344";"I don't care if he is a god! If Lord Vivec holds audience, so must Sotha Sil."
"115740052-0-29345";"You've been told before, Velar. That's not how things work here."
"115740052-0-29346";"Of all the rudeness I've ever encountered. I demand—!"
"115740052-0-29347";"Demand what? A night in a cold cell? Because that could be arranged."
"115740052-0-29348";"You'll cease this line of inquiry immediately."
"115740052-0-29349";"We have a right to know, apostle. If this shadow Seht really is running around—"
"115740052-0-29350";"If you continue this blasphemy I will call the guards!"
"115740052-0-29351";"Suddenly afraid of the truths you so fervently preach?"
"115740052-0-29352";"You'll tell me this instant if there's truth to these rumors!"
"115740052-0-29353";"I have nothing to say on the matter, auxiliary."
"115740052-0-29354";"You will tell me if this portal exists! This could be my one chance to get home!"
"115740052-0-29355";"This is your home now. I suggest you find your place in it."
"115740052-0-29356";"I'm not leaving until you take me to that portal."
"115740052-0-29357";"There's no portal. There is no way home."
"115740052-0-29358";"I'll get the truth out of you, one way or another."
"115740052-0-29359";"Threats of bodily harm will be met with detainment. Please cease and desist."
"115740052-0-29360";"Fetch this! I'll find that portal myself!"
"115740052-0-29361";"I worry for Kamid. He seems so despondent since Maliah's death."
"115740052-0-29362";"I can't believe she even went on the pilgrimage. Thought she had more sense than that."
"115740052-0-29363";"A pilgrimage? To where?"
"115740052-0-29364";"The less you know about the Prognosticator, the better. Trust me on that."
"115740052-0-29365";"I knew it! I knew it all along. No way a factotum can predict the future."
"115740052-0-29366";"Yes, but did it not lead the way to the treasure? Perhaps if it was simply asked the right questions …."
"115740052-0-29367";"I think that the Prognosticator has caused enough trouble, Misanir. Don't you agree?"
"115740052-0-29368";"Oh. Why, yes ma'am. Of course."
"115740052-0-29369";"Good."
"115740052-0-29370";"What, do you think you're too good for the apprentice position, Winding?"
"115740052-0-29371";"I simply did not think it wise of me to go."
"115740052-0-29372";"What? You're the one always sneaking plants into her room!"
"115740052-0-29373";"Yes, what better place to study botany than the Wellspring Everwound?"
"115740052-0-29374";"I will walk the path Seht has placed before me. No other."
"115740052-0-29375";"Fine, fine. I still think you're cranked for passing it up though."
"115740052-0-29376";"Finally! Over here! The Great Mage needs to speak to you!"
"115740052-0-29377";"There he goes! I just replaced his leg springs, so try to keep up!"
"115740052-0-29378";"My, my. Someone clearly didn't care for these factotums. Stay close."
"115740052-0-29379";"Swivel swords? Wonderful. I'm in no condition to navigate this maze. Go, find a way to deactivate these traps."
"115740052-0-29380";"Stop! Don't come any—oh, you're not one of those Daedric monstrosities."
"115740052-0-29381";"Is that them? Have they returned? The world feels so heavy now."
"115740052-0-29382";"It's begun. Now would be the time to pray."
"115740052-0-29383";"Bolin! Is it you? Speak to me! I need to know it's still you. Please!"
"115740052-0-29384";"Terari …? When did we get so old? It's time now, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-29385";"It is … you're free now. I'm sorry for all the pain I caused."
"115740052-0-29386";"Enough tears, love. We're liable to rust. There, that's the smile …."
"115740052-0-29387";"Sorry, but I have to go check on something. The Astronomer will explain!"
"115740052-0-29388";"Are you all right? Please, rest if you need it."
"115740052-0-29389";"Plotting something are we? Well, that rusty heap has been gathering dust for decades. You may as well just give up!"
"115740052-0-29390";"You will be shunned from our order. Cast out, until the time which you can undo the wrong you have begot upon your people. Until you have brought me my successor."
"115740052-0-29391";"I … I'll do it. I'll accept this fate."
"115740052-0-29392";"May Sotha Sil watch over your path, for I can no longer guide you."
"115740052-0-29394";"The summoning worked perfectly, as I knew it would. I assume you need my assistance?"
"115740052-0-29395";"Our champion returns!"
"115740052-0-29396";"Wrong way, assistant."
"115740052-0-29397";"The Planisphere is ours, cur!"
"115740052-0-29398";"How dare you get in the way of our Mistress's plans!"
"115740052-0-29399";"Try all you might, I'll just take the stars again! Right after taking your life."
"115740052-0-29400";"Another switch. Try it out."
"115740052-0-29401";"Over here! We have much to discuss, you and I."
"115740052-0-29402";"I am the Clockwork God! You will kneel before me! Kneel!"
"115740052-0-29403";"Curse you, outsider! I will return!"
"115740052-0-29404";"Let's see it done."
"115740052-0-29405";"I have maintained these stars for millennia. Do not concern yourself."
"115740052-0-29406";"He's not looking is he?"
"115740052-0-29407";"I tried—urgh! I tried … urgh. You know … I think it's better on the way out—urgh."
"115740052-0-29408";"Hey, Bren, maybe send your friend to the Guild Traders. They traffic in all sorts."
"115740052-0-29409";"Not a bad idea! They wouldn't give us the time of day, but I bet they'd be eager to help a cutting figure such as yourself!"
"115740052-0-29410";"Think I'm going to take a stroll. Little smoky in here. No offense."
"115740052-0-29411";"I'll be here, airing the place out, if you have any luck with those Guild Traders."
"115740052-0-29412";"Are you … watching water boil?"
"115740052-0-29413";"Nothing that exciting. I'm trying to get this oil the right temperature, but it was made to work in a furnace."
"115740052-0-29414";"How do you know when it's ready?"
"115740052-0-29415";"When it doesn't incinerate the potatoes."
"115740052-0-29417";"Bren's trying to get us meat again."
"115740052-0-29418";"Oh, how I miss meat."
"115740052-0-29419";"I miss my molar."
"115740052-0-29420";"Maybe you should chew more carefully next time."
"115740052-0-29421";"Sacrifice? Well, that doesn't sound very good."
"115740052-0-29423";"Might need a little nip of that liqueur after this … Mmm. Mmm! Delicious!"
"115740052-0-29424";"Oh …. You shouldn't have …"
"115740052-0-29425";"All right, here goes …."
"115740052-0-29426";"Hey! Bren! This is good! You did it!"
"115740052-0-29427";"Oh—my! There is a hint of home in this. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-29428";"Be careful. Those old mines may be abandoned, but that doesn't mean they're empty. Meanwhile, I shall tell my sisters what occurred here."
"115740052-0-29431";"The wyrds draw power from the Earth Bones, so elemental items make sense. Hmm. Three engraved bowls. This must be the ritual site."
"115740052-0-29432";"Come, everyone! Follow me into the Viewing Garden!"
"115740052-0-29433";"Hurry! Remember, Bewan—!"
"115740052-0-29434";"Unhand me!"
"115740052-0-29435";"Into Mephala's realm, Oracle!"
"115740052-0-29436";"You, from my vision, come speak to me!"
"115740052-0-29437";"I can use … the residual magicka … to open a portal …."
"115740052-0-29438";"Follow me, crow-friend! The shiniest treasure awaits!"
"115740052-0-29442";"Look at all these clicky-clanky lizard monsters!  Good thing they're caged … right?"
"115740052-0-29444";"I—I think it worked! Please, please, let it have worked …."
"115740052-0-29445";"I'm very disappointed, Sherizar. Chirrhari's plaque of safe passage has been rendered inoperable. Now, return to me immediately."
"115740052-0-29446";"I told you what I know, Varuni. I'm trying to make this right."
"115740052-0-29448";"Sotha Sil's factotums still remember me. How touching."
"115740052-0-29449";"No more! This incarceration ends now!"
"115740052-0-29450";"Hmm. Yes, this is it. Evergloam. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-29451";"Watch your step, Featherless. These stones are near to ruin. Just like everything else here …."
"115740052-0-29452";"Left, Featherless! Always left!"
"115740052-0-29453";"Gate's closed. Closed! You'll have to find another way round."
"115740052-0-29454";"Tight corners ahead, crow-friend. Careful!"
"115740052-0-29455";"Which way … which way. Ah! Right! Go right!"
"115740052-0-29456";"Follow the water, fat-legs! East! East!"
"115740052-0-29457";"Pretty banners … now, up the stairs you go!"
"115740052-0-29458";"Ha! We found it, Featherless! Now, in you go. On to the cliffs!"
"115740052-0-29459";"You look tired. Tired! Just a few more stairs to go."
"115740052-0-29460";"Hmm. Draw your weapons. One of Nocturnal's flock-queens hides in that church. Sour taste. No shiny-bits! Be careful."
"115740052-0-29461";"Your clankity-hissing tunnel lies on the other side of this gate. Make that Shadow suffer, crow-friend!"
"115740052-0-29463";"Following me, are you? Brave … and foolish."
"115740052-0-29464";"Managed to banish my shadows again? Relish the victory while you can. It will take more than lamps to keep me from the Throne Aligned."
"115740052-0-29465";"You should be thanking me. If you only knew the things Sotha Sil was capable of … you'd want to kill him too."
"115740052-0-29466";"You're close now … but not close enough. Now, I will unlock this fool from the Throne and claim what's mine!"
"115740052-0-29467";"The Shadow! He knows we're here. Damn it."
"115740052-0-29468";"He's almost to the Throne! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-29469";"No! No! No! It's wrong. It's all wrong! Go back and do it again."
"115740052-0-29470";"I—I apologize, Lord Seht. Please, forgive my stupidity. I shall correct the survey at once!"
"115740052-0-29471";"I hope you will—for your sake. Next time you bring your living-god a Radial survey, you'd better make sure it's accurate!"
"115740052-0-29472";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-29473";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-29474";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-29475";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-29476";"Gimme a minute to cut this. Little boiler coolant gives it some bite."
"115740052-0-29477";"And, there: ""Genuine"" Elden Root Liqueur."
"115740052-0-29478";"As I said before, those tarnished redundants down in the slums are no concern of yours. I've instructed the constabulary to keep a strict eye on them."
"115740052-0-29479";"Yes, that Constable Baldan's done an admirable job. Even so, tarnished and exodromals enter the basilica far too often."
"115740052-0-29480";"And what of these rumors? Black-robed figures lurking on the edge of the Radius?"
"115740052-0-29481";"Honestly, Diwa, settle the boilers, hmm? I will never let tarnished, or exodromals, or mysterious robed ghosts disrupt our work. Believe me."
"115740052-0-29482";"Away! To the castle of my lady love!"
"115740052-0-29483";"By the gears, that alarm shook the whole fortress! It must be something serious."
"115740052-0-29484";"The last time the omnivox alarm sounded, half of the Machine District collapsed. But we needn't worry. Sotha Sil will deal with it."
"115740052-0-29486";"We all have concerns regarding the Queen's decree. I assure you that I am working with Aldarch Tilcalar to safeguard the sanctity of Shimmerene and all of Summerset."
"115740052-0-29487";"Enjoy the food and drink. Business of the city requires my attention, but I shall rejoin you shortly."
"115740052-0-29488";"There you are. Come! Here, behind the waterfall!"
"115740052-0-29489";"Sotha Sil always did admire Dwarven industry, albeit quietly. Perhaps that's why he built his city here."
"115740052-0-29491";"Huh? I don't recall any … you say I won some gold?"
"115740052-0-29494";"Again, thank you! Good luck in the basilica!"
"115740052-0-29495";"Haven't you heard? Sotha Sil is missing! We have to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-29496";"We continue our duties. We can't stand idle and wait."
"115740052-0-29498";"Still nothing on the security coils? Where could he have gone?"
"115740052-0-29499";"He clearly fled the fortress—into the jaws of a fabricant, I hope."
"115740052-0-29500";"Thank the gears, you're back."
"115740052-0-29505";"You seem lost, Sovor. Are you feeling well?"
"115740052-0-29506";"I do not feel. Not as I once did. Nor am I lost."
"115740052-0-29507";"We had an appointment. Did you forget?"
"115740052-0-29508";"I am calculating the innumerable and it is beautiful."
"115740052-0-29509";"Why don't you tell me about it, at length, but let us return to the Asylum Sanctorum first. All right?"
"115740052-0-29510";"I wish you could see the world as I do. It would make convincing you so much simpler. But I have time."
"115740052-0-29514";"I'm glad I found you. While watching the Kinlady's mansion, I saw her ladyship sneak out the back and leave the city."
"115740052-0-29515";"The Kinlady is meeting the Aldarch in the Coral Forest. Raz smells something and it isn't moon-sugar biscuits!"
"115740052-0-29516";"Your reputation precedes you, Eye of the Queen. I am Valsirenn of the Psijic Order. And I agree that the Aldarch is more than a simple monk."
"115740052-0-29517";"We should work together, yes? But let's travel separately to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Raz will find you both at the Coral Forest."
"115740052-0-29518";"The Aldarch! We'd better hurry!"
"115740052-0-29520";"Yaghra, destroy these fools!"
"115740052-0-29521";"Come, nebarra! Let me show you the power bestowed upon me by the Prince of Bargains!"
"115740052-0-29522";"Alienist. I'm told the Asylum Sanctorium is returned to order. So much as such a place can be."
"115740052-0-29523";"We all wrestle entropy in our own ways, but yes, the Saints are at peace in their shrines now."
"115740052-0-29524";"So you say. Can you truly claim they are at peace within their crystal confines?"
"115740052-0-29525";"I only know that they are quiet and that their prior existence was one of anguish. Improving their condition is, as always, my endeavor."
"115740052-0-29526";"A worthy one. How might I aid the Saints as well?"
"115740052-0-29527";"Come, visit, pray to their shrines. I believe earnest faith helps mend their bridges to the divine."
"115740052-0-29528";"An interesting theory. I look forward to testing it."
"115740052-0-29529";"Thanks for the advice."
"115740052-0-29532";"Damn! They're here sooner than expected."
"115740052-0-29533";"Welcome to the Dreaming Cave. Here, we can open paths to other realms."
"115740052-0-29534";"This particular path is blocked by Daedric magic."
"115740052-0-29536";"I have an idea, though. Take the Dawnstar gem from your pack and hold it up to the barrier."
"115740052-0-29538";"Just as I surmised. The barrier—it withdraws from the Dawnstar's power."
"115740052-0-29539";"I'll go after the Kinlady! You deal with the Aldarch!"
"115740052-0-29540";"Ah, five-claw! The Kinlady and Raz had the most illuminating conversation."
"115740052-0-29543";"Together we will be unstoppable!"
"115740052-0-29544";"There! The barrier has been dispelled! Now to find out what they were so interested in protecting."
"115740052-0-29546";"A group this large must have dedicated ritual areas. We should search for one. Their notes should tell us more about their intentions here."
"115740052-0-29547";"This is curious … I'd wager these bones weren't just lying around this cavern, but why put such a focus on reanimating simple beasts?"
"115740052-0-29549";"You'll get yours for interfering, mortal."
"115740052-0-29553";"Interlopers? No! I will not be interrupted!"
"115740052-0-29554";"Enough! Re-route the charge gate and stop this thing!"
"115740052-0-29555";"I'd have expected a lich of such power to be behind this cabal, but this one seemed to be an unwilling thrall. Frightening, but not all bad. His soul may be willing to answer my questions freely."
"115740052-0-29556";"Caluurion! By your true name spoken, I compel you to rise once more and tell us of your captors."
"115740052-0-29557";"Maybe the cat is on to something. This is much more deliberate than the usual vandalism we have to deal with."
"115740052-0-29558";"If the Queen's Eye wants to chase his own tail by following skeever scribblings, fine by me. Anything to keep him out of our business."
"115740052-0-29559";"You are no friend to me, conjurer, but release those who walked with me in life and I will consider you an ally. Fail and we will have a very long time to become acquainted."
"115740052-0-29560";"Not endless … not now. The scales are righted."
"115740052-0-29561";"We have always looked to Saint Olms to understand what is righteous and just. How cruel then, then what was meant to be a gift of boundless freedom, became a prison of endless torment."
"115740052-0-29562";"Isolation and exile … are second only to death in the eyes of the law."
"115740052-0-29563";"I know it will seem no comfort to you, but I'm glad that their bonds of fidelity brought them together in the end. Madness is a lonely affliction in all its forms."
"115740052-0-29564";"This is unheard of! Why have you closed the monastery?"
"115740052-0-29565";"The Aldarch's right. Lock up the newcomers!"
"115740052-0-29566";"But the workers I hired? They were aboard the ship from Rivenspire!"
"115740052-0-29567";"Good people, I hear your concerns."
"115740052-0-29568";"The Kinlady and I, we have only your best interests in mind. Every guest must be sequestered while we ascertain their suitability for Altmer society."
"115740052-0-29569";"Five-claw, good to see you! Raz has a proposal if you have the time."
"115740052-0-29570";"Step away from that scribble, newcomer!"
"115740052-0-29571";"Take a breath, bailiff. It's just a scribble, not one of Razum-dar's conspiracies."
"115740052-0-29572";"Ah, Featherless, you're here! Gate's closed. Closed! Let me help you with that."
"115740052-0-29574";"Just hurry! I can't hold the light for long!"
"115740052-0-29575";"Begone."
"115740052-0-29576";"Send the newcomers back where they came from! We don't want them here!"
"115740052-0-29577";"That's it, the necromantic energies are exhausted. They should be free now."
"115740052-0-29578";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-29579";"He's using the Skeleton Key to unseat the real Sotha Sil! We cannot let him get inside that machine!"
"115740052-0-29580";"I see I'll have to deal with you permanently to complete my task. No matter. Come then! Face the darkness!"
"115740052-0-29581";"Raz doesn't care who you worship! He just wants to know if your cult was attacked recently."
"115740052-0-29582";"Peryite would welcome you! Our Prince accepts all kinds. And you'd be our first Khajiit!"
"115740052-0-29583";"You'd be our first anything, actually."
"115740052-0-29585";"Saint Felms was a proud, noble warrior, but in his battle to conquer death the only casualty was his humility. He aspired to great things, but also terrible."
"115740052-0-29586";"I walked with gods. My mistake was believing I could keep up."
"115740052-0-29587";"There is no weakness in this needed rest. By Lord Seht's will, you may walk with them again."
"115740052-0-29588";"Saint Llothis, beloved of the Three. If any could claim to have known the hearts of the Living Gods, it was him, but for all his wisdom he couldn't see what had changed between them."
"115740052-0-29589";"This was not an extension of my existence, but a transformation. I can see that now."
"115740052-0-29590";"Perhaps we pulled you too early from the cocoon. Go back and rest, until Lord Seht finds the true shape of your soul."
"115740052-0-29591";"Caluurion, we've done as you asked. Tell us of Orryn's plans."
"115740052-0-29592";"Your long ordeal is over. Rest is the only reward I can grant you, until Lord Seht's wisdom lights the path to redemption. Sleep the sleep of the just."
"115740052-0-29593";"I wish you the company of dreams in your rest, and that our prayers will be a balm against all that ails. I have faith that Lord Seht will see you restored. One day."
"115740052-0-29594";"It may have been more fitting for the three Saints to depart as they arrived, in unity, but I'm glad Olms was not alone in the end. The burden of their existence weight heaviest on him."
"115740052-0-29595";"It grows lighter as this body fades."
"115740052-0-29596";"Holy one, let others carry the burden now. I cannot make you whole, but I will offer you comfort until Lord Seht has unraveled the sacred puzzle."
"115740052-0-29597";"The echos of anguish fade at last."
"115740052-0-29599";"He seeks to take what we won at so steep a price, so long ago."
"115740052-0-29600";"Thurvokun. The Dragon we hunted still lies dead in its roost."
"115740052-0-29601";"By my hand, you'll recall. Not that any songs'll be sung about it."
"115740052-0-29602";"Over here, five-claw! This is Raz's old friend, Sadara-do. She follows Meridia, but do not hold that against her."
"115740052-0-29603";"Hmph, no. I was unable to capture the Dragon's soul when we slew it. It's corporeal form was all I was able to claim. And this ruin."
"115740052-0-29604";"Raz thinks this is a bad idea, Sadara."
"115740052-0-29605";"I think I'll visit the memorial for awhile. It seems as good a place as any to be alone with my thoughts."
"115740052-0-29606";"Combat initiation on standby."
"115740052-0-29607";"Tell me he doesn't have the Dragon's soul."
"115740052-0-29608";"This way. We're almost there."
"115740052-0-29609";"Raz is not fond of Daedric cultists, but no one deserves to die like this."
"115740052-0-29610";"The Court of Bedlam are cowards! They struck us down without warning."
"115740052-0-29611";"I will try my best to get your friend an audience with the Lady of Light. The shrine is just inside."
"115740052-0-29612";"Hurry to Lillandril. Prove Emile's innocence. I'll find my way—somehow."
"115740052-0-29613";"Oh, master! What did those bastards do to you?"
"115740052-0-29615";"Look what they did to his body. They defiled Meridia's shrine!"
"115740052-0-29616";"My devoted priest, a loyal soldier, and an intrepid instigator … step closer and bask in Meridia's light!"
"115740052-0-29617";"Meridia, she calls to us!"
"115740052-0-29618";"Why is the statue talking to Raz? Should it be doing such a thing?"
"115740052-0-29619";"Meridia, my Prince! She's gone! I can't feel her presence any longer!"
"115740052-0-29620";"Raz is certain that the nice statue will be fine. In the meantime, let this one take you someplace where you will be safe."
"115740052-0-29621";"Mephala's realm can be daunting, but I'll be with you the entire time."
"115740052-0-29622";"Remember to stay focused on your destination at all times. Otherwise you could get lost in myriad pathways of the Dreaming Cave."
"115740052-0-29623";"And whatever you do, don't lose that gem."
"115740052-0-29624";"You know, I think I'll just … stay out here until you've dealt with our little friend. Just as a precaution."
"115740052-0-29625";"Who's there? Please, don't hurt me! I mean you no harm."
"115740052-0-29634";"You can't treat me like some sort of criminal, you horrid creature!"
"115740052-0-29638";"You've arrived. Good."
"115740052-0-29641";"I think it's time we laid these old bones to rest for good."
"115740052-0-29644";"Unusual knick-knack for an Aldarch's office, wouldn't you agree?"
"115740052-0-29645";"Caluurion, Ulfnor, Sabina, help me unravel the threads binding Orryn to your ancient foe."
"115740052-0-29646";"Breath of the Tricky God. Breeze of the Far Shores. Carry away the lingering life that clings as Sep's skin to this world."
"115740052-0-29650";"Are you there? I think we were separated."
"115740052-0-29651";"There you are! I'm up here!"
"115740052-0-29652";"Try to find a way up while I take a look around."
"115740052-0-29653";"It's like a maze in here, full of dead ends and passages that lead nowhere."
"115740052-0-29654";"Try to use the Dawnstar gem. Maybe it will reveal a path we're not seeing."
"115740052-0-29660";"I think there's something stalking me in here. Oh no!"
"115740052-0-29662";"Thank the stars, I can breathe again!"
"115740052-0-29663";"That's the path revealed by the Dawnstar gem? What I wouldn't give to be able to use portal magic in here!"
"115740052-0-29664";"That wasn't a pleasant experience."
"115740052-0-29665";"That light in the distance. It's brighter, out of place in this dismal setting. That must be the Golden Knight!"
"115740052-0-29666";"Mephala won't leave something as valuable as Meridia's Golden Knight unprotected."
"115740052-0-29667";"You're about to … regret this."
"115740052-0-29668";"Silence or my webs will fill your pretty mouth next!"
"115740052-0-29669";"I tried … to warn them."
"115740052-0-29670";"Took you long enough. I expected this rescue hours ago."
"115740052-0-29671";"Your gratitude has a hollow ring, knight."
"115740052-0-29672";"Oh, I can be very grateful, my lady."
"115740052-0-29673";"Maybe we should just leave him. I'm sure the Ritemaster would understand."
"115740052-0-29674";"Let's get out of here. Meet me outside."
"115740052-0-29675";"Let my voice penetrate the barriers between here and the Dreaming Cave!"
"115740052-0-29677";"Keep them back a few moments longer!"
"115740052-0-29678";"I can sense the portal opening. Just—by the stars! That spider thing!"
"115740052-0-29679";"The portal has opened! Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-29683";"Valsirenn, take the knight to the healers. We'll deal with the sword later. In the meantime, I need to speak with our friend."
"115740052-0-29685";"Help!"
"115740052-0-29686";"Not derived from Ayleid, though I see a possible correlation to Daedric linguistic patterns …."
"115740052-0-29689";"Well done. Come, talk. No more auditions for today."
"115740052-0-29691";"Your wounds, they're just … gone!"
"115740052-0-29692";"I've always healed fast, Val. I can call you Val, right?"
"115740052-0-29693";"Turnabout is fair play."
"115740052-0-29694";"Time for a taste of your own medicine, bastard."
"115740052-0-29695";"What are you doing? Stop this nonsense right now!"
"115740052-0-29696";"Unbelievable."
"115740052-0-29698";"Vanus always said … I should visit Skywatch one day …."
"115740052-0-29699";"I didn't get a chance to thank you for what you did for me."
"115740052-0-29700";"A few of my colleagues are anxious to meet you, Marieve."
"115740052-0-29701";"I suppose. After I examine your garden and collect my thoughts, if that's all right."
"115740052-0-29702";"Of course, Oracle. Come inside whenever you're ready."
"115740052-0-29703";"And there was no sign of Leythen. I don't know whether to be grateful or concerned."
"115740052-0-29704";"We'll find him, Val. Now go check on the pearl while I speak to our new guest."
"115740052-0-29706";"Mage! You dare unmask our Hopefuls?"
"115740052-0-29707";"Simply unforgivable. You are henceforth banished from Rellenthil. Return, and your freedom shall be forfeit."
"115740052-0-29708";"Leave our sacred stage at once, before I have you wrapped in chains!"
"115740052-0-29709";"But—I was certain Larydel was here."
"115740052-0-29710";"No!"
"115740052-0-29711";"Oh, Rinyde. How could you?"
"115740052-0-29716";"You! How could you—you betrayed me!"
"115740052-0-29717";"May the audition begin!"
"115740052-0-29719";"Rinyde! Wait. We must speak."
"115740052-0-29720";"If you wish to speak on Larydel's behalf, speak. I have no time for games."
"115740052-0-29721";"I—I must apologize, Rinyde. I wasn't honest with you. Larydel never envied your ability with magic. He feared you wouldn't join the Sapiarchs if he insisted on remaining here."
"115740052-0-29722";"How can I believe a word you say? If Larydel truly believed that, he would speak to me himself."
"115740052-0-29723";"I am speaking with you, Rinny."
"115740052-0-29724";"Larydel? But—but how?"
"115740052-0-29725";"I've been a member for over a year now, and I should never have lied to you. I feared, well—what I feared doesn't matter anymore. I'm going to tell you the truth. All of it."
"115740052-0-29726";"You had best do so at once, little brother—little sister. If this is truly what you wanted, why not just tell me? All I want is for you to be happy!"
"115740052-0-29727";"Then perhaps we can both be happy now, even if we must be apart."
"115740052-0-29728";"So the rat queen sends her vermin to destroy me? Come then!"
"115740052-0-29729";"Pour the elixir into the pool. That should provide the final boost we need to trigger the augury."
"115740052-0-29730";"Is that a …. a s-spider? Agh! No, no! Get it away from me!"
"115740052-0-29731";"Please, won't you help a poor soul like me?"
"115740052-0-29732";"Are you sure those creatures can be trusted?"
"115740052-0-29733";"Here we stand, the most favored servants of Clavicus Vile, Mephala, and Nocturnal, on the verge of the greatest victory for our Princes!"
"115740052-0-29734";"Have no fear! Isn't that why we formed the Court of Bedlam? Besides, what happens next in Rellenthil will seal Summerset's fate!"
"115740052-0-29736";"Small blessings … but even soulless Dragon bones pose a terrible threat in the hands of someone as powerful as Orryn. We have to stop his plans."
"115740052-0-29737";"Ah, this one has been looking for you!"
"115740052-0-29738";"I'll admit I didn't expect you to deliver yourself to me, Zaan—oh, what's this?"
"115740052-0-29739";"Delvers. How disappointing. Here I thought I might finally acquire the missing piece to the matching set."
"115740052-0-29740";"Kindly leave before I have to clutter the place up with your corpses. I have more pressing concerns."
"115740052-0-29741";"That's what I'm afraid of."
"115740052-0-29742";"I'm going to dig through the notes I've found so far, see what else you can discover deeper in."
"115740052-0-29743";"You're still here? If you must admire my work, at least allow me to put my best fossil forward."
"115740052-0-29744";"Undo what has been done, I beg you!"
"115740052-0-29745";"This is confusing."
"115740052-0-29746";"Enough, Silurie! These mysterious deaths are our business to solve, not yours."
"115740052-0-29750";"Go inside and we'll discuss this later. And take off that ridiculous hood!"
"115740052-0-29752";"This is a little trick I picked up in Chorrol."
"115740052-0-29753";"Stendarr, shine your righteous light on those that would flee your justice. Show me where evil lurks and I will deliver retribution."
"115740052-0-29754";"Two lights? There's not supposed to be—all right, whatever."
"115740052-0-29755";"I'll follow this one. Follow that light and see where it leads you, then meet me inside the refectory. Go, go!"
"115740052-0-29758";"Raz wants to ask the Canonreeve a few more questions. Take the Psijic and go investigate the sinkhole."
"115740052-0-29760";"Let go of me, dammit! You don't understand!"
"115740052-0-29761";"Ah, the accomplice. Welcome."
"115740052-0-29762";"Release her."
"115740052-0-29763";"But sir—"
"115740052-0-29764";"Now."
"115740052-0-29765";"This is a mistake."
"115740052-0-29766";"We're all done being idiots? Good. Let's find this Daedra."
"115740052-0-29768";"This is going to end badly."
"115740052-0-29769";"Now, now, children. This might be fun. I've not hunted a Daedra in decades."
"115740052-0-29770";"It's trying to slip away into the real world! I'll hold it as long as I can!"
"115740052-0-29771";"Chew on that for awhile, gut-sucker."
"115740052-0-29772";"This light will reveal the Daedra. Be ready."
"115740052-0-29775";"More outsider magic? Reckless, Silurie."
"115740052-0-29776";"Have a little faith, Hy. It's tracking something."
"115740052-0-29777";"Ah!"
"115740052-0-29778";"Not to be an ungracious host, but I've tired of entertaining."
"115740052-0-29779";"No! After her!"
"115740052-0-29780";"Can't say I didn't warn them. Come on!"
"115740052-0-29781";"Caluurion. See that our uninvited guests are made comfortable for a very long stay."
"115740052-0-29782";"How much more of your company must I endure, Orryn? None of you are welcome here!"
"115740052-0-29783";"So many of the things you've broken I can easily replace, but Caluurion … he was a unique specimen. He'll never be the same."
"115740052-0-29784";"And what are these two without the third? Incomplete. Ancillary. Superfluous."
"115740052-0-29785";"Ulfnor. Sabina. Smash yourselves to dust against these vandals."
"115740052-0-29787";"I'm so glad you could be here for my moment of triumph. I promise your interest in my work will be rewarded."
"115740052-0-29788";"At last I can unveil the centerpiece of my collection: Thurvokun. Ah, how exquisite it turned out to be."
"115740052-0-29789";"And your shattered bodies will make the perfect set dressing."
"115740052-0-29790";"A dead end. How embarrassing."
"115740052-0-29791";"Where did I go wrong?"
"115740052-0-29792";"The Court of Bedlam will eradicate the lesser races!"
"115740052-0-29795";"Oh, gods, it's going to eat me! Hyircil! Anyone? Help me!"
"115740052-0-29796";"Silurie? You … saved me? I—"
"115740052-0-29798";"I can't hold it …! Dammit!"
"115740052-0-29799";"Ah! I'm all right! I'm all right! Somehow …."
"115740052-0-29800";"Well, I've had my fill of this place. Let's excuse ourselves before anymore dinner guests arrive."
"115740052-0-29801";"I might fast for a month after this."
"115740052-0-29802";"I'll feed your corpse to the Insatiable!"
"115740052-0-29805";"One of you is the thief, I'll crack this case yet."
"115740052-0-29808";"Yes, this is exactly what we're looking for. Why, it's almost as if I can hear the words. Sel-rah ang-yond. Eastern … temple?"
"115740052-0-29809";"Daedra? I don't have time for distractions. Could you hold them off while I finish translating?"
"115740052-0-29810";"The inscription indicates that the temple is further up. Quick, follow me."
"115740052-0-29811";"How did we get separated? Quick, take care of these daedra before they notice me. This rubbing paper is delicate, and I don't want to ruin it with viscera."
"115740052-0-29818";"Ah-ha. Now, let's see …. That voice again. Pa-rah Eek-nay. Past … pathway?"
"115740052-0-29819";"These transcriptions are the only way we're getting through this twisted forest. Defend me while I translate them."
"115740052-0-29820";"I've got it! Follow me, the temple should be just ahead."
"115740052-0-29822";"Forte? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-29823";"Fletch! What's happened? The whole troupe is looking for you."
"115740052-0-29824";"Grand Maestro Forte? Why, I had no idea you were in Ebon Stadmont."
"115740052-0-29825";"Grand? Oh no, I'm simply Maestro Forte. Hardly worthy of the title Grand yet!"
"115740052-0-29826";"Daedra again? Oh, we don't have time for this!"
"115740052-0-29827";"The House of Reveries? In Ebon Stadmont? Why wouldn't I have heard about that?"
"115740052-0-29828";"Did you hear it too? That woman's voice? At first I thought I was imagining it."
"115740052-0-29829";"Fletch—-argh!"
"115740052-0-29830";"I'm sorry dear, but your role has been cut!"
"115740052-0-29831";"The temple … you must go back …."
"115740052-0-29832";"You expect me to just let you take my life? My legacy?"
"115740052-0-29833";"Fletch! Please, no!"
"115740052-0-29834";"It's time for the grand finale of our little production!"
"115740052-0-29837";"You got here first! How far behind was I?"
"115740052-0-29838";"The walls and ceiling. They don't look stable. I'll try to reinforce the weak spots and catch up with you."
"115740052-0-29839";"We're looking for inscriptions. Alert me once you see any gibberish carved into stone."
"115740052-0-29840";"Well, seems the rumors are true. Ebon Stadmont truly does twist around you. Perhaps another inscription will help guide us."
"115740052-0-29843";"Future's door …. Drat. Well, I've realized where we are."
"115740052-0-29844";"Over here! Keep quiet and tell me if you see what I see."
"115740052-0-29845";"Master, intruders in the cave!"
"115740052-0-29846";"Heed me, my creatures! Destroy the intruders!"
"115740052-0-29848";"No matter. You will go no further and your bones will join this army!"
"115740052-0-29849";"No—no! I can't hold it! Ah!"
"115740052-0-29850";"Who's there? By Xarxes, it's … it's you!"
"115740052-0-29852";"There you are! How did you get inside without me seeing you?"
"115740052-0-29853";"That young idiot! We need to get over there!"
"115740052-0-29854";"This way. Up here!"
"115740052-0-29855";"Damn! No sign of where the Sea Sload disappeared to."
"115740052-0-29856";"The Sea Sload left us something to remember it by. We need to dispatch that creature."
"115740052-0-29858";"Excellent. Now, follow me into the forest. The sooner we start, the better."
"115740052-0-29859";"Somehow Raz knew he'd find you here!"
"115740052-0-29860";"Hurry, this way!"
"115740052-0-29861";"Sea Sloads! This is worse than the Ritemaster imagined!"
"115740052-0-29862";"Meet me in Artaeum after you talk to the Queen's Eye."
"115740052-0-29863";"No! My beautiful masterpiece! How …?"
"115740052-0-29864";"I have a lot to answer for? The Court of Bedlam is going to turn me into a god!"
"115740052-0-29866";"You and your Queen have no authority over a true Altmer, you mangy cat!"
"115740052-0-29867";"Foolishness can be ignored. Murder and treason, not so much."
"115740052-0-29868";"This one cannot allow your crimes to stand unanswered."
"115740052-0-29869";"The Eye of the Queen? How dare you accuse my son of treason!"
"115740052-0-29872";"Would you leave that alone? You'll damage it!"
"115740052-0-29873";"What are you doing? Stop that!"
"115740052-0-29874";"Are you mad? You're damaging my plants!"
"115740052-0-29875";"Hey there! Leave that alone!"
"115740052-0-29876";"Please, leave that aurialis alone! You can't take it!"
"115740052-0-29877";"Finally, a moment's peace!"
"115740052-0-29878";"Maybe even deal with our unworthy Queen!"
"115740052-0-29879";"Wait, wait! Don't hurt me!"
"115740052-0-29880";"That's it! This is the last time I get caught up in artist rivalries!"
"115740052-0-29882";"Good … fight."
"115740052-0-29883";"My chains are broken!"
"115740052-0-29886";"Ritemaster! The abyssal pearl. It's gone!"
"115740052-0-29889";"Gone? How? I set the protections personally!"
"115740052-0-29891";"Let me accompany you."
"115740052-0-29892";"You need to rally the others. Your friend and I should be able to handle this."
"115740052-0-29893";"Oriandra, you should have consulted me beforehand."
"115740052-0-29894";"We can reach the beach through this section of the old college."
"115740052-0-29895";"Sir Darien, deal with this barrier, if you please."
"115740052-0-29896";"My pleasure!"
"115740052-0-29897";"The way is open. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-29900";"There's the pearl. Destroy it and close that portal!"
"115740052-0-29901";"Now let's go check on the vaults."
"115740052-0-29902";"Be prepared for anything. This is Nocturnal's realm, after all."
"115740052-0-29903";"Let's kill some monsters and find this damn crystal."
"115740052-0-29904";"The featherless one walks the path once more. But where is the pretty crystal he carried last time?"
"115740052-0-29905";"Did that bird just talk? You heard that, right?"
"115740052-0-29906";"Pay the crows no mind. They're nothing but an annoyance."
"115740052-0-29907";"The featherless one couldn't resist the Sea Sload, not on his own."
"115740052-0-29908";"What nonsense is this?"
"115740052-0-29909";"He doesn't remember! So desperate he was, he leaped at our Mistress's offer!"
"115740052-0-29910";"Speak plainly, crows! Come back here!"
"115740052-0-29911";"Iachesis, calm down. Their words mean nothing."
"115740052-0-29913";"This is getting stranger and stranger."
"115740052-0-29914";"The path ends here."
"115740052-0-29915";"I remember this."
"115740052-0-29916";"Iachesis, what are you saying?"
"115740052-0-29917";"I'm saying I remember taking the Heart through that portal."
"115740052-0-29919";"Mephala's webs? I hate those things! Allow me."
"115740052-0-29920";"Step cautiously. I remember very little about what lies on the other side of this portal."
"115740052-0-29921";"The barrier of webs. Burn it away so we can enter the rotunda."
"115740052-0-29923";"How are you all faring? Everyone all right?"
"115740052-0-29924";"Lodiss and I are fine, but Ludovic wasn't so lucky. He fell."
"115740052-0-29925";"I was afraid of that when I saw he wasn't with you. You two stay there, we'll go around to meet up."
"115740052-0-29926";"Recite the words of power!"
"115740052-0-29927";"It's not like we have much of a choice. Just be prepared for battle when you get here."
"115740052-0-29928";"Be careful fighting those two, they look stronger than the rest. Smell stronger, too."
"115740052-0-29931";"Damn it, they found me again! I'll return when I can—"
"115740052-0-29932";"My friends, the Heart of Transparent Law will soon be back in our hands!"
"115740052-0-29933";"Heart, reveal yourself! Gah Noro berrin, vo rah Larow e javeel!"
"115740052-0-29934";"Iachesis—your chest, it's glowing!"
"115740052-0-29935";"Of course! I put the Heart inside myself. It was the perfect hiding place!"
"115740052-0-29936";"Uh oh. Mephala and Clavicus Vile. This could be bad."
"115740052-0-29937";"Look, Mephala. The mortal hid the Heart inside his own body. How clever!"
"115740052-0-29938";"But why did Nocturnal keep this from us? No matter. I'll take the crystal now, Ritemaster."
"115740052-0-29939";"My wards … shall … protect me!"
"115740052-0-29940";"Impressive, for a mortal. But the wards won't hold long against our power!"
"115740052-0-29941";"Stop struggling, mortal. You're only delaying the inevitable."
"115740052-0-29942";"Fight, Iachesis! Just hold on!"
"115740052-0-29943";"Where do all these Daedra keep coming from?"
"115740052-0-29944";"Hold still, mortal, and I'll make this quick."
"115740052-0-29945";"Val … promise me … you'll lead them … if …."
"115740052-0-29946";"K'Tora! I killed you! I remember our battle as clear as day!"
"115740052-0-29948";"Another Daedric intrusion?"
"115740052-0-29949";"You remember exactly what I want you to remember."
"115740052-0-29950";"Don't even say it, Iachesis! Just keep fighting!"
"115740052-0-29951";"And thanks to the Orbs of B'Raken Drel, your deepest memories will be mine!"
"115740052-0-29953";"They're … tearing me … apart …."
"115740052-0-29954";"Mephala, stop that! I've got him! Wait, what's—"
"115740052-0-29955";"Nocturnal? How dare you interfere!"
"115740052-0-29956";"Always told him that name of his would do him no good."
"115740052-0-29957";"Get out of my realm, Princes. You are no longer welcome. The Heart belongs to me. We made a deal, didn't we, mortal?"
"115740052-0-29958";"Iachesis?"
"115740052-0-29959";"I did what I had to. I hid the Heart, even from you. The only way to retrieve it is to kill me."
"115740052-0-29960";"Very well. I accept those terms."
"115740052-0-29961";"No!"
"115740052-0-29962";"Out here, quickly! We need to hurry if we're going to help the Ritemaster!"
"115740052-0-29963";"Our means of entering Sea Keep is this way. There's no time to spare."
"115740052-0-29966";"I hope you are a strong swimmer, incidentally."
"115740052-0-29967";"We need to go. Now."
"115740052-0-29969";"Pan? How did you—never mind. Get me out of these chains!"
"115740052-0-29971";"I'll see to her bonds. Cas, I need you to tell us everything you know about what your crew is planning."
"115740052-0-29972";"Too late to right the ship, captain. Nothing left to do but sink with the rest of us."
"115740052-0-29973";"Pan, your plan's insane. I love it. Where do we start?"
"115740052-0-29974";"They stopped being my own the moment they mutinied."
"115740052-0-29975";"We? No, you have to run while you can, Cas. Even if we stop the storm—"
"115740052-0-29976";"Stow it, Pan. I'm as much to blame for this as you. I'm not leaving you to fix it yourself."
"115740052-0-29983";"There's the secret door. Give me a moment to open the seal."
"115740052-0-29985";"There's a font here."
"115740052-0-29986";"Is there any way to tell if this is working?"
"115740052-0-29987";"Remaining in one piece will be a good sign."
"115740052-0-29988";"I'm in favor of that."
"115740052-0-29989";"Rulotar? Damn it …."
"115740052-0-29996";"That does it. We should meet Castire at the gate."
"115740052-0-29997";"I love you, Pan, but we can't go on like this."
"115740052-0-29998";"I know, Cas."
"115740052-0-29999";"What will happen? When I'm gone?"
"115740052-0-30000";"I pick up the pieces. Or I find myself in irons."
"115740052-0-30001";"I'm sorry. For everything."
"115740052-0-30002";"I'm not."
"115740052-0-30003";"The span between us may be as far as the sun and the sea, but you'll never be far from my thoughts."
"115740052-0-30004";"The sun and the sea were never so lucky as to have crossed paths."
"115740052-0-30005";"We've been fighting against the current for years. It's time to see where it means to take us."
"115740052-0-30006";"You mean together?"
"115740052-0-30007";"If you're up for a swim."
"115740052-0-30008";"Where would we go?"
"115740052-0-30009";"The storm could have carried us off to anywhere, Pan. Pretend it did."
"115740052-0-30010";"Let's cast our fate to the wind."
"115740052-0-30011";"If anyone asks, we were swept out to sea. Never to return. Farewell."
"115740052-0-30012";"You've had a long day. See to your troops and get some rest."
"115740052-0-30013";"I'm honored by your consideration, but Sea Keep is my responsibility. I won't rest until it is secure."
"115740052-0-30014";"As you wish."
"115740052-0-30015";"Battlereeve Pandermalion, you stand accused of consorting with Maormer agents. I hereby relieve you of your post until these claims can be addressed. I pray they are baseless."
"115740052-0-30016";"I submit to judgment."
"115740052-0-30017";"Ritemaster … damn it! Hang on, I'll get us out of here!"
"115740052-0-30018";"Dawnbreaker will protect us! I hope."
"115740052-0-30019";"Meridia's vessel. You have no power here."
"115740052-0-30020";"I'll show you power, you monster!"
"115740052-0-30021";"The sword of light. I'll take that."
"115740052-0-30022";"My sword! I just fixed that!"
"115740052-0-30023";"The Heart is mine and soon the Crystal Tower will belong to me! I no longer need Mephala or Vile."
"115740052-0-30024";"Hold on! I'm getting us out of here!"
"115740052-0-30025";"Valsirenn … where's the Ritemaster?"
"115740052-0-30026";"Nocturnal killed him. We couldn't stop her."
"115740052-0-30027";"No … that's not possible."
"115740052-0-30028";"What a shame. They never bothered me the last time I was here. What manner of illness has this cult created …?"
"115740052-0-30029";"K'Tora's mind. It's shutting down!"
"115740052-0-30030";"I'm taking the Ritemaster back to his study. You need to get out of there!"
"115740052-0-30031";"Use the staff to exit the mindscape! Then talk to Sotha Sil!"
"115740052-0-30035";"We should split up. Don't want this little Scamp slipping out behind us. I can handle this gap easily. You search the other hall."
"115740052-0-30036";"Well, this doesn't look good. No wonder Ila and Lodiss are still down on those steps."
"115740052-0-30038";"Watch out for this one! She must be the giants' matriarch."
"115740052-0-30039";"Shouldn't the storm be growing weaker?"
"115740052-0-30040";"I said it probably wouldn't get any stronger!"
"115740052-0-30042";"Damn him! I can barely hold my footing!"
"115740052-0-30043";"Keep fighting! One of us has to make it!"
"115740052-0-30044";"You need to go to Valsirenn's study right now. There's a problem."
"115740052-0-30045";"Farwenya. I'm afraid we've left you a considerable mess."
"115740052-0-30046";"Pandermalion? You're alive?"
"115740052-0-30047";"Valsirenn, stop! You're going to kill him!"
"115740052-0-30050";"These gargoyles were just statues the last time I was here. What changed?"
"115740052-0-30051";"You live? This won't do! This won't do!"
"115740052-0-30052";"The summoner! She's getting away!"
"115740052-0-30053";"Why? Where are you going?"
"115740052-0-30054";"Find that mage and kick her ass! I'm going back for Hy."
"115740052-0-30055";"You'll be trapped!"
"115740052-0-30056";"Why does she never listen?"
"115740052-0-30057";"Beats me. All I know is that we were stuck between a rock and a pitfall."
"115740052-0-30058";"Ila, we can't allow the disease to spread. I need you and Lodiss to go back and burn every corpse you find."
"115740052-0-30059";"Fine. Just make sure you don't take down the cult leader without us. We still have a deal."
"115740052-0-30060";"Oriandra, tell Darien to meet us at the Crystal Tower Gatehouse. And keep an eye on Leythen while we're gone."
"115740052-0-30063";"Ila, hold! Let them take care of this one. I need you and Lodiss to hold off any reinforcements."
"115740052-0-30064";"No more stalling! Tell Raz what's happening at the Crystal Tower. Now!"
"115740052-0-30065";"Climb the watchtower and see for yourself."
"115740052-0-30066";"Why did you tell him that?"
"115740052-0-30067";"His teeth were very sharp, Tumbadoril."
"115740052-0-30070";"Ugh! Fine. But our deal still stands. After their leader is felled, I want my payment."
"115740052-0-30071";"By Sovngarde. Let's just focus on bashing in some heads, yah?"
"115740052-0-30072";"Finally free! Oh, sorry, no time to chat. I have to get back to Seeks. He must be worried sick!"
"115740052-0-30073";"The Crystal Tower isn't supposed to do that, yes?"
"115740052-0-30074";"The tower started glowing right before you arrived."
"115740052-0-30075";"No sign of Teraniel, but this is definitely the epicenter of the magic I felt."
"115740052-0-30076";"Well, that was … dramatic."
"115740052-0-30077";"That's it! It reeks of that monster's realm. I'll hold it open, go!"
"115740052-0-30078";"Ugh, it feels like worms wriggling through my soul. I can do this. I can do this."
"115740052-0-30079";"What are you waiting for? Go!"
"115740052-0-30080";"The tower! What's happening?"
"115740052-0-30081";"Raz thinks this is bad."
"115740052-0-30082";"Come, my friend! To the gatehouse!"
"115740052-0-30083";"You! Again! How did you reach this place?"
"115740052-0-30084";"Cleansing tides, answer me! Rage and drag this wretched place into the deep!"
"115740052-0-30085";"Wait your turn, morsel. You'll meet the Insatiable soon enough."
"115740052-0-30086";"Where's the shield, Jorvuld? You said the leader would have it!"
"115740052-0-30087";"He wasn't the one leading them, I'm afraid. My friends, prepare yourself. For Zaan the Scalecaller … has risen again."
"115740052-0-30088";"The Dragon Priest that's buried here?"
"115740052-0-30089";"She must have it. We need to keep climbing! I will not be denied my prize."
"115740052-0-30090";"Next you'll tell me we have to fight her Dragon, too. Wait. We don't have to … fight a Dragon, do we?"
"115740052-0-30091";"No, Scalecaller's Dragon abandoned her long ago. I fear she serves a new lord now. Perhaps one just as powerful."
"115740052-0-30092";"Don't lose … focus!"
"115740052-0-30093";"The diamond key … it won't meld with me!"
"115740052-0-30094";"Keep trying! We need to open these gates!"
"115740052-0-30097";"The energy. Something feels wrong."
"115740052-0-30098";"No. I think it's work—arrgh!"
"115740052-0-30099";"Damn it, no!"
"115740052-0-30100";"Is someone out there? Help me out of this thing!"
"115740052-0-30101";"That was unexpected, yes?"
"115740052-0-30102";"Can we get moving now? I'm just itching to get to our next assignment!"
"115740052-0-30103";"The itching's probably just a symptom of the venom. Next your flesh will start to rot off. Seen it happen a million times."
"115740052-0-30104";"Seeks, you're hilarious! I just can't get enough of your jokes. My skin's going to rot off, ha! Oh, what will you come up with next?"
"115740052-0-30105";"The Sapiarchs are dead. Now what do we do?"
"115740052-0-30109";"Darien, gather the diamond keys. The Psijic Order will do what the Sapiarchs could not."
"115740052-0-30110";"No. I'm done with the Psijic Order. Too many deaths, not enough action."
"115740052-0-30111";"Raz will meet our friend in Alinor. You two do what you must."
"115740052-0-30112";"Another one? You there, come here."
"115740052-0-30113";"Hold, courier! I would like to have a word, if you would."
"115740052-0-30114";"You found me. At last …."
"115740052-0-30115";"Hard at work, Tindoria? How goes your finger painting?"
"115740052-0-30116";"Ah, Vaerelel! I see you've deigned to step out of your florid abode. Come to see how a real artist creates?"
"115740052-0-30117";"I'd enlighten you with a response, but we both know my skill speaks for itself."
"115740052-0-30118";"Why, you're certainly skilled at boasting! If only you had the artistic sense Auri-El gave a mud hopper, you might produce something of worth."
"115740052-0-30119";"Ha! Your tongue remains as sharp as your wits. When I'm declared the royal court's newest artist, I'll be sure to send you an invitation to dinner."
"115740052-0-30120";"What a kind offer, though I'm sure that won't be necessary. After all, we both know that I'll be the one to acquire that position."
"115740052-0-30121";"Look at that, you can follow directions! My master's waiting for you deeper inside."
"115740052-0-30122";"Hear ye my tale of sisters, two, bound by love and joy …"
"115740052-0-30123";"The elder set sail, but the younger remained, alone with her tomes and her heartache …."
"115740052-0-30124";"At length a caller came to the gates of the Direnni—a fellow traveler on sorrow's road, with dark wisdom on his lips."
"115740052-0-30125";"All her heart's doors closed and locked, the sister's power grew—her gold eyes fixed on graves and tombs, the necromancer's muse."
"115740052-0-30126";"At length the eldest did return, flush with arcane might. She found her sister's undead thralls, and wept long at the sight."
"115740052-0-30127";"Knowing death could not contain her sister's newfound power, the eldest and her Direnni kin buried me alive … here, screaming into the black."
"115740052-0-30128";"Down, Cur. I've got it covered."
"115740052-0-30129";"It's a familiar face, Cur."
"115740052-0-30130";"You've finally arrived! And with quite a … strong stench."
"115740052-0-30131";"Excuse me a moment, Tableau. I must speak with our mutual acquaintance."
"115740052-0-30133";"Lillandril is just to the west. You shouldn't have any trouble—."
"115740052-0-30134";"Manacar! Didn't I tell you to remain seated? I'm only halfway through this sketch!"
"115740052-0-30135";"I, well … yes. My apologies."
"115740052-0-30137";"Did you hear that? Someone's in trouble! This way!"
"115740052-0-30138";"Thought I was a goner … like the others."
"115740052-0-30140";"I can't take it anymore! What could possibly be keeping you … oh my."
"115740052-0-30141";"I'm ruined. I'll be the laughingstock of Alinor."
"115740052-0-30142";"I'm afraid only skewered meat is on the menu."
"115740052-0-30143";"Wait, don't hurt him! He's not a real bandit!"
"115740052-0-30144";"Tableau, what exactly have you gone and done?"
"115740052-0-30149";"Some kind of trade ledger? How mundane. It seems like the Elves who built this place engaged in deals with … Goblins. That can't be right, can it?"
"115740052-0-30150";"These look like plans for resettlement. Elven … and Goblin. They were proposing a land trade with the tribes. It seems the offer was refused."
"115740052-0-30151";"Hmm. This looks like scouting reports. Land surveys. Goblin settlements. Why was the water source of such interest to them?"
"115740052-0-30163";"Please, master! Mercy—arrgh!"
"115740052-0-30164";"Even in death, they serve! So the Hound found you? Good. Let's discuss an arrangement, shall we?"
"115740052-0-30165";"The answers must lie in these ruins! Oh, Naliara, if only you'd waited! Hurry—let us claim the prize!"
"115740052-0-30166";"Zan'hi, you must listen! Mirulon only wants what is best for us! He—"
"115740052-0-30167";"He is mad as a sugar-sick frog! Please, Hedani, you must go. If only for a few days."
"115740052-0-30168";"Will you at least come with me?"
"115740052-0-30169";"I want to, my love. But I still have much to do. Who's this now?"
"115740052-0-30170";"Help! Someone help!"
"115740052-0-30171";"One of your friends from Mother's Den? Please, Zan'hi, be quick."
"115740052-0-30173";"Just follow me and step onto the dais."
"115740052-0-30174";"Elise, wait! We need to stay together!"
"115740052-0-30175";"By the Seven Sacred Texts! Who has dared invade this place of learning?"
"115740052-0-30176";"This is unheard of! Attacked in our own sanctuary!"
"115740052-0-30177";"There she is! Lotus! After her!"
"115740052-0-30178";"Whoa! Whoa! Control her! Get a hold of your beast, Talomar!"
"115740052-0-30179";"So, you managed to teach it some discipline after all."
"115740052-0-30180";"The Nord Cultural Exchange proudly returns the Queen's stolen items! And this Stuffed Goat. It's a Nord treasure!"
"115740052-0-30181";"Remarkable work! I'll grant you that writ of authenticity now."
"115740052-0-30182";"Friend Sapiarch! Here are the cultural items you asked for, along with a gift from Rigurt—a Nord Night Favor!"
"115740052-0-30183";"That's everything I wanted, plus an arousing example of Nord erotica. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-30184";"Rigurt has just the thing to make Enigma feel like a Nord. Essence of Mammoth!"
"115740052-0-30185";"What a powerful odor! It reminds me of mammoths charging across fields of ice and snow!"
"115740052-0-30186";"Yes, yes, you'll have your prize. Just as we agreed."
"115740052-0-30187";"You fools may have defeated me, but you'll never stop the Master of Tasks! Still, his pestilence spreads. And this one shall know its blessing!"
"115740052-0-30188";"According to the maps I studied, the Labyrinth is this way."
"115740052-0-30189";"May you suffer in Oblivion for all your wretched deeds. And may I be the last victim you ever claim."
"115740052-0-30190";"No … no, I was so close! Spellbreaker was within my grasp. It should be mine!"
"115740052-0-30191";"By the stars, this place is enormous!"
"115740052-0-30192";"We should be able to reach the upper levels through there."
"115740052-0-30193";"I won't kill anyone! I told you!"
"115740052-0-30194";"The time for protests has passed, child. You will serve us … whether you want to or not."
"115740052-0-30196";"Stop him, please! He's killed countless innocent people! Get him away from me!"
"115740052-0-30198";"Here's the official letter of recommendation you requested."
"115740052-0-30199";"A word of advice. If Vindilween refuses to help, remind her that the Divine Prosecution might remember the incident at the Battlereeve's dinner party."
"115740052-0-30200";"The stench! It makes me woozy but also fills me with Nord bravado. How inspiring!"
"115740052-0-30206";"Hurry up, Leythen! They could find us at any moment!"
"115740052-0-30207";"Something's wrong."
"115740052-0-30208";"Wrong? Why doesn't that surprise me?"
"115740052-0-30214";"I hear voices up ahead."
"115740052-0-30215";"No more sages need die today, Sapiarch. Just give me the diamond keys."
"115740052-0-30216";"The Resolute Diamonds are not mine to give. Especially not to a Daedric cultist."
"115740052-0-30217";"Leythen, stop!"
"115740052-0-30218";"Looks like the newcomers get to have all the fun today."
"115740052-0-30220";"Fascinating. I would have expected this illness to weaken the giants, but it seems just the opposite."
"115740052-0-30221";"Elise? I thought you already left? What are you doing sulking around here?"
"115740052-0-30223";"Don't look so surprised. Come on, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-30224";"All right, Elise. I'll help you. But if we don't find anything unusual in the Conservatory, I'm turning you over to Vinelore myself."
"115740052-0-30225";"Deal. If I'm crazy, go ahead and turn me in. But, you know there is something going on here, Talomar."
"115740052-0-30226";"Yet another reason to wipe the temple clean of this repugnant cult."
"115740052-0-30227";"While I agree, we also can't allow this sickness to spread. I'll need you and Lodiss to burn the corpses, just like before."
"115740052-0-30228";"Ugh. Just call me Lodiss the Torch."
"115740052-0-30230";"I doubt it will be any easier going from here, but we'll see you all further up."
"115740052-0-30231";"How did this happen? My people should have been safe within these walls!"
"115740052-0-30232";"I recruited most of these men and women. I was responsible for them."
"115740052-0-30233";"Champion of Nocturnal, what magic is this? I've never seen anything like it."
"115740052-0-30234";"This was always the plan. Nocturnal's plan."
"115740052-0-30235";"So Nocturnal did betray my mistress!"
"115740052-0-30236";"Your mistress is weak. Come with me and I'll show you what true power looks like!"
"115740052-0-30237";"Leythen, no! Come on, we can't let them get away!"
"115740052-0-30238";"Don't … don't let it take me …."
"115740052-0-30239";"No worries, I've got you! I think."
"115740052-0-30240";"Good luck with that. Now stay out of the way or death will be the least of your concerns."
"115740052-0-30241";"This magic, it destroys everything! What good is power if there's nothing left to rule?"
"115740052-0-30242";"You there! Burn the webs! Quickly, quickly!"
"115740052-0-30243";"This is what the Court wanted all along. An end to the old ways. A new beginning."
"115740052-0-30244";"I won't be party to the death of innocents! I won't—"
"115740052-0-30245";"I'll go, but if this is just a ploy so you can betray us, you'll have to deal with me."
"115740052-0-30246";"Be silent, knight, or I'll let you taste the blade you once carried. I wish to speak to your friend now."
"115740052-0-30247";"Mephala's damn webbing! It's in all my nooks and crannies! Thanks for helping, though."
"115740052-0-30248";"Darien, go the other way and meet us in the back chambers. We want to make sure Nocturnal's earl didn't leave us any surprises."
"115740052-0-30249";"Meet me outside and we'll make contact with my Prince."
"115740052-0-30250";"Mephala, appear before your faithful servant!"
"115740052-0-30251";"I answer my earl's summons, only to find him with these … unworthies. Do you betray me too, Leythen?"
"115740052-0-30252";"Never, my Prince. We share a common enemy now. Please, talk to them and hear what they have to say."
"115740052-0-30253";"No! Save the Dawnstar Gem!"
"115740052-0-30254";"That's it? A maybe?"
"115740052-0-30255";"I'll return to Artaeum with Darien and tell them what we learned. Meet us there."
"115740052-0-30256";"Let's just get this over with."
"115740052-0-30257";"Ew. What's that smell? It's coming from over here."
"115740052-0-30264";"Tell Hannayel … I'm sorry …."
"115740052-0-30266";"Is that all you can think of, after all that we've been through? Your greed has blinded you, Ila. I pray one day you see that."
"115740052-0-30267";"I know this is strange, but let's get to this stone. Perhaps it can answer some questions."
"115740052-0-30269";"Can you hear me? My name is Oriandra. I'll help you get out of this place."
"115740052-0-30270";"You aren't frozen. You just think you are."
"115740052-0-30271";"You can move. You just need to remember how."
"115740052-0-30272";"Now go. Beyond the door. You need to see for yourself before I tell you more."
"115740052-0-30273";"It may appear beautiful, but it's an illusion. A trap designed to control you."
"115740052-0-30274";"Well, it is a lovely view. Once you put aside all the strangeness."
"115740052-0-30275";"Just a moment. I need to get this door for Lodiss and Ila."
"115740052-0-30278";"Talomar, take your new friend here and get off my grounds. The rangers will take things from here."
"115740052-0-30287";"Seems like these cultists have as much of an affinity for the dead Dragon Priest as you do, Jorvuld. They keep invoking her name."
"115740052-0-30288";"Bah. You would think these cozies would just worship a Daedric Prince, like any sensible cult."
"115740052-0-30289";"I'm glad to see you both uninjured… and unafflicted, I hope?"
"115740052-0-30290";"None of them got close enough to give us their little blessing, I can assure you of that."
"115740052-0-30291";"This way. Follow Raz!"
"115740052-0-30292";"K'Tora won't tolerate your resistance much longer."
"115740052-0-30294";"Defend yourself! In the mind trap, memories can kill you!"
"115740052-0-30295";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30296";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30297";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30298";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30299";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30300";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30301";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30302";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30303";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-30304";"Quiet! Someone approaches! Is it Karnhar? I can't scent him!"
"115740052-0-30305";"Disappearances are all the more reason for you to leave."
"115740052-0-30306";"Pleased to be seeing your beautiful face, your majesty! Sign the treaty and we can break for dinner, unless you want to be negotiating first."
"115740052-0-30307";"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, ambassador. I'll listen to what you have to say and we'll see where the evening takes us."
"115740052-0-30309";"Well done! With every memory that returns, your resistance grows stronger. Now follow me!"
"115740052-0-30311";"I can't go any farther in this form. If K'Tora notices me, we'll both be lost."
"115740052-0-30312";"You need to reach the tower to escape the mind trap. I can't go with you, but I'll send messages to guide you."
"115740052-0-30313";"Just believe in yourself and you can do this. You simply need to jump."
"115740052-0-30315";"Didn't you all hear me? I want to be left alone!"
"115740052-0-30316";"I've returned, Esterdel. And I've … reflected on my actions."
"115740052-0-30317";"I suppose nearly getting yourself killed will do that. I'm just glad you finally came to your senses."
"115740052-0-30318";"Yes, of course. Dearest, tell me. Our wedding day … weren't we told the moons would be full?"
"115740052-0-30319";"Why, yes. A most auspicious sign, the priests told us."
"115740052-0-30320";"Oh, yes. Most auspicious indeed. I very much look forward to it."
"115740052-0-30323";"Is that a person? Hey, you there! Wait!"
"115740052-0-30332";"Captain coming aboard! Boat's prepped and ready!"
"115740052-0-30333";"All right. You two, go prepare the boat our friend brought. We'll provide a distraction. Trinimac's wrath be with us."
"115740052-0-30335";"Hold them off while I spear that cutter!"
"115740052-0-30336";"Don't let them turn that fire ballista on us!"
"115740052-0-30337";"That'll do! Fall back and get to the boat!"
"115740052-0-30338";"Look, people! Best approach with caution."
"115740052-0-30339";"The Crimson Seal. You can use it to find whatever is keeping me here. I know that somehow."
"115740052-0-30340";"Everything else feels as distant as a dream. I don't even remember how I died."
"115740052-0-30341";"Please, press on. You are no Keeper, but the seals will work all the same. You must open the way and go deeper below."
"115740052-0-30342";"What's that? A feather? Wait a moment—what's light as a feather? Air!"
"115740052-0-30343";"A pure gemstone. You don't get much closer to elemental earth than that."
"115740052-0-30344";"A cup of water. Well, that's disappointingly obvious. Marieve must have been in a hurry."
"115740052-0-30345";"You were a terrific father to our daughter, Leythen. I'll never forget that."
"115740052-0-30346";"You were always Ealdaawe's hero, Val. I envied the way she looked up to you."
"115740052-0-30347";"I'm sorry, Leythen. I should have been there with you. With her. At the end."
"115740052-0-30348";"This is Artaeum? Raz is impressed—and truly frightened by the very strange sky."
"115740052-0-30349";"Ah, here comes your friend now!"
"115740052-0-30350";"Just remember, you were never here. The Conclave isn't fond of visitors."
"115740052-0-30351";"For a place that doesn't like visitors, Raz thinks it's pretty busy, yes?"
"115740052-0-30352";"Please, approach. We know you are here."
"115740052-0-30353";"Psijics must be wine drinkers, because this ale they make tastes awful."
"115740052-0-30354";"Talk to me when you're ready to proceed."
"115740052-0-30355";"I'll lead you through the Fields of Regret to reach the Crystal Tower."
"115740052-0-30356";"Hey! That dog just talked!"
"115740052-0-30357";"I can establish contact with Mephala. She's ready to appear if you're willing to lower the defenses."
"115740052-0-30358";"Sotha Sil, the false god. I should have expected to see you."
"115740052-0-30359";"Lady Mephala. Will you honor the agreement you made with this mortal?"
"115740052-0-30360";"I am always true to my word. Now, send forth the mortal who consistently avoids the tangles of my webs. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-30361";"Remember, if any of you stray too far from the protection of the Resolute Anchor, you'll be lost in the nothingness between realities."
"115740052-0-30362";"And know that I will be watching …."
"115740052-0-30363";"Can she do that? I hate being spied on!"
"115740052-0-30364";"Now it's my turn. Let me use the gift my master gave you and I'll get you to the Crystal Tower."
"115740052-0-30365";"Get the Heart and restore the crystal known as Transparent Law. But remember, you'll need a relic of divine energy to accomplish that."
"115740052-0-30366";"You would challenge me to a duel? How droll."
"115740052-0-30367";"But then, how can we have a proper contest? You don't even know the Altmer code of dueling, do you?"
"115740052-0-30368";"Fighters? What kind of idiots would come to this Eight-forsaken mountain?"
"115740052-0-30369";"These Saviors you mentioned. Did they happen to be members of the family?"
"115740052-0-30370";"Oh, yes. The founders and protectors of this great realm. Does the surface still speak of their great sacrifice?"
"115740052-0-30371";"Um, in a manner of speaking. I came here to learn more about this branch of my family."
"115740052-0-30376";"It must be fate! Corgrad opened its doors so that you could enter. Oh, I have so much to show you."
"115740052-0-30377";"Here, here! This is Nemfarion, the eldest and wisest of the ancestors resting here. Yes, I can see the likeness."
"115740052-0-30379";"What are you—let go!"
"115740052-0-30380";"Let! Go! Where are you taking me?"
"115740052-0-30381";"Save us from these monsters! Please!"
"115740052-0-30386";"I formally present Lirendel, cherished son of the Nivulirel, to accept the Orc, Roguzog's, challenge!"
"115740052-0-30387";"Let's get this over with, shall we?"
"115740052-0-30388";"Bother and bones! Nocturnal sends creatures into our realm? Not while Barbas is on guard! Skaafin, come forth!"
"115740052-0-30389";"My lady, we need to keep moving. You can't help Sunhold if you're dead!"
"115740052-0-30391";"Just look at this place. How in Syrabane's name did you get the Ritemaster to unlock it for you?"
"115740052-0-30392";"He rightly acknowledged our superior skill. It's only natural that he'd let us work here."
"115740052-0-30393";"Well, it's quite a privilege."
"115740052-0-30394";"Privilege? It's our right, Vanus. You mustn't be so humble all the time."
"115740052-0-30395";"Oh, not this again …. Come, let's explore further!"
"115740052-0-30396";"Secluded, cavernous—yes. This will be perfect for my research."
"115740052-0-30402";"What, besides us?"
"115740052-0-30404";"Where are you going, creature?"
"115740052-0-30405";"I promised to show you the way. There, follow that path. That's the way to the tower. Now I have a realm to defend!"
"115740052-0-30407";"What have you done? This is just … repugnant."
"115740052-0-30408";"Oh Vanus, I would have thought you less judgmental. It's just a bit of puppetry. Nothing but arcane lift and spirit-handling."
"115740052-0-30409";"That was a living thing, Mannimarco. You're edging close to a dangerous line. Too close."
"115740052-0-30410";"What a mess! And to think we're depending on the actions of mortals! Ah, well, let's talk."
"115740052-0-30412";"You sound like the Ritemaster. The only lines are those you draw in your mind."
"115740052-0-30413";"Remember Mephala's warning. Stray too far from the Resolute Anchor and you'll get lost between realities."
"115740052-0-30414";"This place looks surprisingly intact."
"115740052-0-30415";"The interior and the exterior of such places rarely coincide perfectly. I pity the Sapiarchs that were present when Nocturnal unleashed this magic."
"115740052-0-30417";"Pst. Over here."
"115740052-0-30418";"I don't know how you entered the tower … but you must get out of here."
"115740052-0-30419";"She's still alive! We have to help her."
"115740052-0-30420";"No, stay back! The relic that protects me, it's failing. You can't help me."
"115740052-0-30421";"She's right. Look how she's starting to fade."
"115740052-0-30422";"I'm not going to …. Please, just find a new avenue of research. All right?"
"115740052-0-30423";"Oh, Vanus, you fool. You will never understand true power."
"115740052-0-30424";"Oh, come on. Jump! It's fun! I want to see if you bounce."
"115740052-0-30426";"I am! I'll show you!"
"115740052-0-30427";"Uh … right. I'm not afraid!"
"115740052-0-30428";"Ugh. Disgusting creatures!"
"115740052-0-30429";"This is what happened to our classmates? What is wrong with you?"
"115740052-0-30430";"Wrong? Honestly, grow up, Vanus. There is no right and wrong—only power and weakness."
"115740052-0-30431";"You've made me for a fool. I can't believe I didn't see the rot infesting your soul."
"115740052-0-30432";"You will answer for this eventually. I swear it."
"115740052-0-30433";"And you, my friend, will answer for your short-sightedness when I eclipse you in every way."
"115740052-0-30434";"I don't want to die!"
"115740052-0-30435";"Let me help you. Clear your mind."
"115740052-0-30436";"It's so hard … to concentrate …."
"115740052-0-30437";"Think of your loved ones. Picture their faces and my magic will help you."
"115740052-0-30438";"I see them. The pain … is fading. I can see—"
"115740052-0-30439";"She … she's gone."
"115740052-0-30440";"Her last moments were peaceful. I saw to that."
"115740052-0-30441";"The magic that held back the shadows is gone. They'll be upon us before we know it."
"115740052-0-30442";"Lin! Can you hold this portal open?"
"115740052-0-30443";"You tattled didn't you? You're a greater fool than I thought."
"115740052-0-30444";"You tainted the Ceporah Tower! You're worse than a murderer."
"115740052-0-30445";"Pathetic. Do you expect Iachesis to bind me here? No, he'll simply banish me from the island."
"115740052-0-30446";"That won't be enough. You're a beast, Mannimarco. A beast that needs to be caged."
"115740052-0-30447";"Of course you're right. And once I reach the mainland I'll show the world just how right you are."
"115740052-0-30448";"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ritual to complete."
"115740052-0-30449";"Now, to my masterwork. If Iachesis does not see the genius of my work, he can rot with the rest of them."
"115740052-0-30453";"The seal. The key. Take them. We must keep her locked away. Do not let her escape!"
"115740052-0-30456";"Yes! I feel …. I feel … not much different, actually. What is going on?"
"115740052-0-30462";"The dying Sapiarch was right! That is a ballista!"
"115740052-0-30463";"It's not broken. It's just missing a few parts. Look around while I get the rest of it back in working condition."
"115740052-0-30469";"No. You will not be doing anything like this ever again, Ulliceta."
"115740052-0-30470";"Spying on us, eh? Well, I'm sick of you cowards hiding knowledge away then punishing us for discovering it."
"115740052-0-30471";"If not for adma'na like you, we wouldn't have to hide things like the Eye you stole. Come, Ulliceta. Your punishment awaits."
"115740052-0-30473";"Good! I'm anxious to tell you all exactly what I think of you."
"115740052-0-30476";"That was Mannimarco! And Vanus Galerion—the leader of the Mages Guild. Can you believe this? It must be Mannimarco's laboratory!"
"115740052-0-30477";"I always heard Vanus and Mannimarco were friends, but it seems like a complex relationship. Fascinating!  Let's see what else we can find!"
"115740052-0-30478";"I always thought Mannimarco was confused. Misguided. Seems he knew exactly what he was doing. Amazing."
"115740052-0-30479";"So these are the events that led to Mannimarco's exile. Let's keep exploring!"
"115740052-0-30482";"Well, I didn't expect that. Meet me outside. We have a lot to talk about."
"115740052-0-30483";"Go find your own patch of beach!"
"115740052-0-30484";"That should work. Let's blast a way out of here."
"115740052-0-30487";"Behold, the Crimson Keeper. Keep to the oath, seal-bearer. Do not believe her lies. She is not what she seems."
"115740052-0-30494";"Perfection requires constant vigilance, so back to it!"
"115740052-0-30500";"Curious. From the opening in the ceiling, it appears that we're no longer in Vile's realm."
"115740052-0-30501";"No! You ruined it!"
"115740052-0-30503";"Phantom warriors closed in on all sides! The hero was sure to perish!"
"115740052-0-30505";"Argh! Stop interrupting!"
"115740052-0-30506";"Gladly! You're boring, just like the rest! I'll finish this hero myself!"
"115740052-0-30508";"She did something to the controls. The gate won't open."
"115740052-0-30509";"No more! Get … out of my head!"
"115740052-0-30510";"The gate … it's opening! Go on! I can't hold this for very long!"
"115740052-0-30512";"I can't …. Is it gone?"
"115740052-0-30518";"Yes. Finally!"
"115740052-0-30519";"We arrive at the moment of choice. Please, use the Keeper's flame on my remains and set me free."
"115740052-0-30520";"Face me, you talentless hack! Your story ends here!"
"115740052-0-30521";"That's far enough. My Mistress can't be interrupted. Her work is too important!"
"115740052-0-30522";"Give me the damn Dawnbreaker back!"
"115740052-0-30523";"We are … not … dying … like this!"
"115740052-0-30524";"That worked? I mean … I mean … I mean, of course it worked. I just need a moment …."
"115740052-0-30525";"No! I won't go back! You can't do this! My masterpiece!"
"115740052-0-30526";"I'm returning the last of Meridia's power to the blade so you can stop Nocturnal. I wouldn't do this for anyone else."
"115740052-0-30527";"Thank you … for everything."
"115740052-0-30533";"I feel the chains slipping from my shoulders. My spirit is free … free, to go wherever I wish."
"115740052-0-30534";"Oh, you have done quite a deed. Your kindness will not be forgotten … or squandered."
"115740052-0-30535";"I'm sure you have many questions. I'm sorry I cannot stay to answer them. I have much to do. So much to do. Farewell."
"115740052-0-30538";"Did Thurvokun send you to usurp me? To take this temple back?"
"115740052-0-30539";"No matter. This mountaintop shall be your grave. Just as it was mine."
"115740052-0-30540";"By the … what was that?"
"115740052-0-30541";"Where is it going?"
"115740052-0-30542";"North, looks like. Out to sea. Toward Balfiera."
"115740052-0-30543";"Huh. Strange."
"115740052-0-30544";"Sentry! Raz owes you for that game of cards and has come to pay!"
"115740052-0-30545";"Don't you remember? Raz always pays his debts. And he always buys the drinks!"
"115740052-0-30546";"Gold and drinks? Well, my relief should be along soon, so why not!"
"115740052-0-30549";"No! Why would you…! Agh!"
"115740052-0-30550";"I … trusted you! You're just like them! Just like my family!"
"115740052-0-30551";"Curse you! I won't go back! I won't! I'll kill you all!"
"115740052-0-30552";"No!"
"115740052-0-30553";"Did you hear that?"
"115740052-0-30554";"It sounded angry. And hurt."
"115740052-0-30555";"I hope I never have to go in there."
"115740052-0-30556";"Likewise. The fog may have cleared out, but this place still gives me the creeps."
"115740052-0-30558";"With that brute defeated, you've lost the protection of his pillars. Finish the other ogre, quickly!"
"115740052-0-30559";"Surviving the next set of tremors will now prove rather difficult! Finish off the remaining ogre, fast!"
"115740052-0-30564";"We'll purge this world, make it clean! All shall be blessed … and perish!"
"115740052-0-30565";"Indriks sometimes graze on these trees. Look around and let me know if you find anything."
"115740052-0-30566";"Something's wrong down here. I sense magic. Vile magic."
"115740052-0-30567";"A curious pearl. I wonder where the Aldarch acquired it?"
"115740052-0-30568";"Probably not important. I'll meet you in the undercroft and we can see what's going on with the newcomers."
"115740052-0-30569";"For now, I must attend to other matters."
"115740052-0-30571";"Right. Let's head further inside."
"115740052-0-30573";"There, Lotus's enclosure. Maybe we can pick up her trail."
"115740052-0-30574";"I believe she ran off that way before I lost track of her."
"115740052-0-30575";"Father! You had me so worried! What happened? Where's your boat?"
"115740052-0-30576";"None of that now, my nervous gup. I'll tell you all about it, but first there's one more thing we need to see to."
"115740052-0-30578";"There's someone alive over there. See if you can help her."
"115740052-0-30579";"Naliara! Stay strong! Your salvation is at hand! Though if you could call out, that would be helpful!"
"115740052-0-30584";"Elise, what are you still doing here?"
"115740052-0-30585";"Good luck with your indrik hunt, Talomar. Try not to get killed."
"115740052-0-30586";"Dammit. Let's hope we have better luck with Lotus."
"115740052-0-30587";"Living on Artaeum for a few centuries doesn't prepare you for physical activity."
"115740052-0-30588";"Let the Eye of the Queen know what we discovered and I'll catch up with you later."
"115740052-0-30590";"Looking for someone?"
"115740052-0-30591";"<<1>>, may I present the Nord ambassador, <<2>>."
"115740052-0-30592";"As long as the evening includes lots of mead, that sounds fine to me!"
"115740052-0-30593";"Ambassador, I find your Nordish inclinations to be most … refreshing."
"115740052-0-30594";"Oh, Rigurt has plenty of inclinations, your majesty!"
"115740052-0-30595";"We look forward to finding out all about your inclinations, Ambassador Rigurt."
"115740052-0-30597";"Murder? That wasn't part of the plan, Aldarch!"
"115740052-0-30598";"You know nothing of the plan, you fool. Let me give you a taste of what the Prince of Bargains has in store for this pitiful world."
"115740052-0-30599";"Lotus! Easy, girl. I'm here …."
"115740052-0-30602";"That's an acceptable bargain."
"115740052-0-30603";"Then find Ulfnor and Sabina and dispatch them as you did me."
"115740052-0-30605";"You can't make such demands. The Sapiarchs are the keepers of the Crystal Tower!"
"115740052-0-30606";"But Lotus? I … yes, Conservator."
"115740052-0-30607";"This is about more than the College of Sapiarchs, Larnatille!"
"115740052-0-30611";"If Raz could intervene? Perhaps we should hear from our newly arrived friend?"
"115740052-0-30612";"We concur with Razum-dar. Let us hear what the adventurer has to say."
"115740052-0-30613";"Our friend has proven their mettle time and time again. Raz thinks you should hear about these deeds."
"115740052-0-30614";"I don't see why we need to stand guard."
"115740052-0-30615";"There's no shortage of bones here up to the task."
"115740052-0-30616";"Your Prince? I want no part of Daedra! Help!"
"115740052-0-30617";"The who?"
"115740052-0-30618";"Oh, uh—yeah I knew that … don't tell Lizabet."
"115740052-0-30619";"With things so close to completion, Lizabet's expecting trouble."
"115740052-0-30620";"Can't trust it to mindless guardians, if the Scalecaller's minions come sniffing around."
"115740052-0-30621";"What tomb have you been buried under? Zaan. The Scalecaller. Our mortal enemy."
"115740052-0-30622";"Find me on Artaeum after you finish with the Eye of the Queen."
"115740052-0-30624";"That light … that is not natural, yes?"
"115740052-0-30625";"And so the gears turn once more. Ever changing, yet ever the same. With you always in the center, it seems."
"115740052-0-30626";"I take no pleasure in such distractions from my work. Still, I would not dislike it if we spoke again. Farewell."
"115740052-0-30627";"Oriandra, admit our guests now, yes?"
"115740052-0-30628";"What are you up to, Razum-dar?"
"115740052-0-30629";"We have heard enough! We accept that the adventurer is trustworthy. Sapiarch Larnatille, listen to what they have to say."
"115740052-0-30630";"Raz is sure there are many more details to work out, but for now this one just wants a very strong drink!"
"115740052-0-30631";"If you would wait a moment, my friend. I'd like to talk privately."
"115740052-0-30638";"Disobedience doesn't suit you, Talomar. Uncooperative animals don't last long here."
"115740052-0-30639";"What have you done with Lotus, you monster?"
"115740052-0-30640";"I'd be more concerned for yourself right now."
"115740052-0-30650";"I'll be all right, Valsirenn. Manipulating the Dreaming Cave always exhausts me."
"115740052-0-30651";"We'll take it slow. Let the others clear the path for us."
"115740052-0-30653";"I assure you, Chief, it would bring me no joy to unleash our revelators on your new home. But I'll have to, unless you let us take a look around."
"115740052-0-30656";"Fine. But just one of you—your partner. Do your work, then leave us in peace."
"115740052-0-30657";"One, then. I'll be sure to report your compliance to the Divine Prosecution."
"115740052-0-30658";"But first, let us sit by the sea. I feel like there's much for us to talk about."
"115740052-0-30659";"There! I think we can get out over there!"
"115740052-0-30663";"How's it look in there?"
"115740052-0-30664";"Packed with mud and debris …."
"115740052-0-30665";"Like we have a choice in the matter. Come, join me for a meal. Meat's fresh enough."
"115740052-0-30666";"Delightful."
"115740052-0-30667";"Ugh. Bosmer cuisine is truly revolting."
"115740052-0-30668";"Stay focused, Sapiarch! We'll deal with the Daedra."
"115740052-0-30669";"This platform is safe. Go. I'll finish up here."
"115740052-0-30670";"How about through here?"
"115740052-0-30671";"No. Flooded. Maybe if I was a Sea Elf …."
"115740052-0-30672";"Finish the ritual! We will keep you safe!"
"115740052-0-30673";"This platform is safe! Go! Raz will finish up here!"
"115740052-0-30674";"No! Wait! I did everything you asked! I just can't anymore. I'm not a killer! I only wanted to protect Farril—"
"115740052-0-30675";"We could have worked such terrible wonders together. Pathetic."
"115740052-0-30676";"You, though! You're perfect. Tell Lorne her past is hunting her present. Yes … tell her that."
"115740052-0-30679";"This breach looks promising. Take a look?"
"115740052-0-30680";"It's me, Barbas. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-30682";"Can you hear me? I have troubling news."
"115740052-0-30684";"This place is vast. Old too. How much death you think this place has seen over the years?"
"115740052-0-30685";"Tens of thousands. Without a doubt. These old Dwemer ruins were often cities in their own right in their time."
"115740052-0-30686";"Why all the fresh corpses then?"
"115740052-0-30687";"Trouble is brewing. No time to excavate all those old bones."
"115740052-0-30688";"How long does she intend to channel that barrier?"
"115740052-0-30689";"Long as the master desires it, I imagine."
"115740052-0-30690";"Hope they don't put me on ritual duty again. It'll be the death of me."
"115740052-0-30691";"She'll be the death of you if she hears you grousing."
"115740052-0-30692";"All right, whose experiment nearly killed me last night? Fess up."
"115740052-0-30693";"Those twisted toadstools—started popping up to vomit their spores everywhere. I was coughing up blood all night!"
"115740052-0-30694";"Lizabet said to seed them around—to deter intruders."
"115740052-0-30695";"What are you talking about?"
"115740052-0-30697";"A little warning might have been nice."
"115740052-0-30698";"Nebarra …."
"115740052-0-30699";"Voices!"
"115740052-0-30700";"Vey Arillas! Abameld shauta!"
"115740052-0-30701";"I heard it again! Be careful."
"115740052-0-30702";"Nedoril! No … no. I understand. Rellenthil is loyal to the Queen."
"115740052-0-30703";"Nocturnal's been eliminating the sects of the other Princes. Are you surprised she'd turn on her former allies?"
"115740052-0-30704";"Scout ahead and find the shrine. I'll stay with Leythen until he's ready to move on."
"115740052-0-30705";"I've never seen this design before. What's its purpose?"
"115740052-0-30706";"Remains this old are often bereft of their original essence. This ceremony increases viability."
"115740052-0-30707";"That explains the difficulty I've been having."
"115740052-0-30709";"Gads, the smell! I thought these were supposed to be for the food stores."
"115740052-0-30710";"No. Raw materials for the master's research."
"115740052-0-30711";"Very raw."
"115740052-0-30712";"If this makes you squeamish, you've chosen the wrong vocation."
"115740052-0-30713";"What? This place has been … what happened here? Oh no. No, no, no."
"115740052-0-30714";"Tarnamir? Tarnamir, are you here?"
"115740052-0-30715";"Tarnamir? No. No. I can't …."
"115740052-0-30717";"This camp looks recent. I'll bet your missing persons just discovered that these ruins make decent shelter."
"115740052-0-30718";"You found something?"
"115740052-0-30719";"Oh, I'm going to enjoy this."
"115740052-0-30720";"It pains me that it had to end this way, but my Mistress will not be denied."
"115740052-0-30721";"Butcher! How dare you pretend to care about the men and women you slaughtered!"
"115740052-0-30722";"Every action I performed was in the service of Nocturnal's grand plan."
"115740052-0-30723";"Leythen, she has my Dawnbreaker. Ask her if she'll kindly return it."
"115740052-0-30724";"There'll be plenty of time for regrets where you're going."
"115740052-0-30726";"Now to ensure this Dragon stays buried for a very long time."
"115740052-0-30727";"May your elusive spirit be forever swallowed by the Void."
"115740052-0-30728";"Avad!"
"115740052-0-30730";"Stand back and I'll show you. You already saw how Celan died. Now we'll see the others."
"115740052-0-30731";"They aren't ready. Not yet. We'll have to make do with what we have."
"115740052-0-30732";"It's just a handful of intruders. The master doesn't seem concerned, so why are you?"
"115740052-0-30733";"Of course the master isn't concerned, but if they killed Lizabet I certainly am."
"115740052-0-30734";"Right … maybe they're riper in the middle? Help me dig."
"115740052-0-30735";"Another barrier seal. We need to destroy that crystal so I can dispel it."
"115740052-0-30736";"It's like it's drawing its power from beyond the veil. Caluurion, can you help?"
"115740052-0-30737";"I have a bad feeling about the fate of these people. Maybe they are further in the cavern."
"115740052-0-30738";"If I must."
"115740052-0-30739";"What is this contraption? It doesn't look Dwemer."
"115740052-0-30740";"I think the Akaviri Potentates invented it during the Reman purges."
"115740052-0-30741";"What's it do?"
"115740052-0-30742";"It cuts off heads."
"115740052-0-30743";"Another crystal. Destroy it."
"115740052-0-30744";"This seal is like the last one. I'll need help to break it."
"115740052-0-30745";"This one's mine! Nothing can stop Ulfnor the Dragonslayer!"
"115740052-0-30746";"I have conjured up the spirits of countless beings. Some, truly ancient. Why is it the Dwemer never answer? Why can't I make them answer?"
"115740052-0-30747";"They aren't meant to return. Divine retribution."
"115740052-0-30748";"When I reach out I don't feel resistance. I feel nothing at all."
"115740052-0-30749";"The Void is beyond the reach of any mortal."
"115740052-0-30750";"The master's thralls. I don't like the way they watch us."
"115740052-0-30751";"I prefer the empty stares of hollow eyes as well. The smart ones. They feel like they're biding their time."
"115740052-0-30752";"Waiting for a moment of weakness …."
"115740052-0-30753";"Then—boo! They're upon you! Eating your soul!"
"115740052-0-30754";"Maintain the seal. Nothing to fear from death so long as you maintain the seal …."
"115740052-0-30755";"Just a temporary sacrifice. The master will reward you with eternal life for your loyalty …."
"115740052-0-30756";"Never really liked this body anyway. Ex-wife certainly didn't …."
"115740052-0-30757";"Maybe the master will let me pick a new vessel? Always liked the Dunmer. Or maybe a Khajiit …."
"115740052-0-30761";"What's this? A tiny Ghost of the Green? Ha! Run along, whelp, before—."
"115740052-0-30762";"What have I done?"
"115740052-0-30763";"Celan definitely killed Halimorion. Now, Farril."
"115740052-0-30764";"Who—who are you?"
"115740052-0-30765";"I'm afraid you've seen too much. You poor thing."
"115740052-0-30766";"Soravil was observing Celan when Farril saw him. She slashed him with her sickle before he overpowered her."
"115740052-0-30767";"So it is you. Shame on you."
"115740052-0-30768";"The shame is Lorne's, old mer. Now she'll have your death on her conscience too."
"115740052-0-30769";"No, Soravil. This is you, and you alone."
"115740052-0-30770";"Give my regards to my loving wife, and Lorne's degenerate husband."
"115740052-0-30771";"Lorne …."
"115740052-0-30772";"I know you're watching, Lorne. Now that I've broken your spirit, and you've broken your vow, come to the place where my wife is buried. There, I will break your body."
"115740052-0-30773";"I need some air. I'll be outside."
"115740052-0-30774";"How could he blame me for this? Is it not enough that I lost my husband? Damn him."
"115740052-0-30775";"His wife was buried here. This is where we'll find him."
"115740052-0-30776";"Come. Let's put an end to this."
"115740052-0-30778";"Destroy that creature and then I can contact my Prince!"
"115740052-0-30779";"Raz will explain things to the pretty Sapiarch and make sure she returns safely to Lillandril. You go find the one in the ruins."
"115740052-0-30780";"Arcta nagaia!"
"115740052-0-30781";"There you are! This place is—Meridia's light! What is that thing?"
"115740052-0-30782";"Gara go yara ar!"
"115740052-0-30783";"They'll be here any moment. They must not disturb the master! The punishment for our failure will be truly terrible."
"115740052-0-30784";"Hurry, this way!"
"115740052-0-30785";"That's it?"
"115740052-0-30786";"Basically."
"115740052-0-30787";"And people say we're morbid."
"115740052-0-30788";"Nasty, nasty …. She'll kill you all. Zaan the Scalecaller … will …."
"115740052-0-30789";"Perhaps."
"115740052-0-30790";"Soravil! I know you're here! What do you want from me?"
"115740052-0-30791";"Oh Lorne, I've already taken so much. Your teacher, your honor, your pride … there's only one thing left for me to take."
"115740052-0-30792";"Your life."
"115740052-0-30796";"Soravil …."
"115740052-0-30799";"Mephala's Daedra! They sealed the chamber. We'll need to go through them."
"115740052-0-30800";"Don't worry about me. Go! We can't let Soravil escape again!"
"115740052-0-30801";"Ah, the Ghost of the Green's final victim. Time to die, admanen!"
"115740052-0-30802";"Bless you. I can walk, but you lead the way."
"115740052-0-30803";"Ten thousand venerations to you."
"115740052-0-30804";"The gates are barred. The locking mechanisms are controlled from those two towers."
"115740052-0-30805";"Easy enough. You two take one, I'll take the other."
"115740052-0-30806";"Be careful."
"115740052-0-30807";"Aren't I always?"
"115740052-0-30817";"Don't let him kill us!"
"115740052-0-30818";"A bargain is a bargain. The island for the Heart of Transparent Law."
"115740052-0-30819";"Yes, yes, just as we agreed. But only a portion of the crystal. We don't want to alert the Sapiarchs too soon."
"115740052-0-30820";"Tell your fellow Princes all will be well. The Ritemaster is no match for my mind magic."
"115740052-0-30821";"So Nocturnal has assured me. Don't disappoint us, K'Tora."
"115740052-0-30822";"Pan, your reinforcements—they're here! They can't see me with you!"
"115740052-0-30823";"Castire, wait!"
"115740052-0-30824";"I lured you here for one purpose, worm."
"115740052-0-30825";"Your Abyssal Cabal may … defeat me … but you'll never stand against … the entire Psijic Order."
"115740052-0-30826";"Once again you fail to grasp the obvious. When the time is right, you will do exactly as I command. Until then, forget …."
"115740052-0-30827";"No, no … arrgh!"
"115740052-0-30828";"Repeat my words, worm. Tell me what you must do."
"115740052-0-30829";"Yes, yes. Hide it away until I call for you to give it to me. Not even the Princes must know where it is."
"115740052-0-30830";"I will … enter the Crystal Tower. I will … take the Heart of Transparent Law."
"115740052-0-30831";"Oriandra, Valsirenn, assist me. Let us open a path and not keep the Prince of Secrets waiting."
"115740052-0-30832";"Hide … the Heart …."
"115740052-0-30833";"Leythen, promise me you'll keep them safe!"
"115740052-0-30834";"I promise, Val."
"115740052-0-30835";"Oriandra, if I die saving the world, know that our brief time together has made me a better man."
"115740052-0-30836";"What are you talking about?"
"115740052-0-30837";"Shh, it's all right to cry. I'll do my best to return to you. I promise."
"115740052-0-30838";"What just happened? What's that crazy knight talking about?"
"115740052-0-30839";"I don't think I like Barbas very much."
"115740052-0-30840";"I'll return to Lillandril and warn the guards."
"115740052-0-30841";"Good idea. Perhaps I should accompany you."
"115740052-0-30842";"So that's what they meant when they said the tower was in every realm at the same time!"
"115740052-0-30843";"Hello? Is someone there?"
"115740052-0-30844";"I'd like to explore this compound one day. When fewer Daedra are about, of course."
"115740052-0-30845";"Valsirenn! No, damn you!"
"115740052-0-30848";"Yes, that must control the gate across the chamber. It appears to require a key, however. Down there. That looks like a likely candidate."
"115740052-0-30849";"Where did she come from!"
"115740052-0-30850";"Hail, mighty warrior!"
"115740052-0-30851";"The gate! Leythen, watch out!"
"115740052-0-30853";"We should … we should keep moving. There's nothing more we can do here."
"115740052-0-30855";"Yeah, let's do that. C'mere, fancy-pants."
"115740052-0-30856";"An examiner's quorum needs three members. You both know this."
"115740052-0-30857";"Not this again …."
"115740052-0-30858";"It's not just superstition, Soravil. We need outside perspective."
"115740052-0-30859";"So, what? We just randomly recruit the next adventurer that passes by?"
"115740052-0-30861";"Did you hear something?"
"115740052-0-30862";"Focus! Focus! None of that will matter if they break the seal."
"115740052-0-30863";"One more adjustment and … there! You are now attuned!"
"115740052-0-30864";"Attention! Class is now in session."
"115740052-0-30865";"Another body. Delightful."
"115740052-0-30866";"Oh dear. Blood on her hands and blouse … but no slashing wounds?"
"115740052-0-30867";"This doesn't fit the pattern. The Ghost always kills with a bow. This was spur of the moment … unexpected. Maybe she fought back."
"115740052-0-30868";"Why do you insist on puzzling these things over like an ephem? You know the death-memory ritual. It's a simple—."
"115740052-0-30869";"Enough, Soravil. You know that's forbidden. Admanen, look around and see if you can find the source of this blood."
"115740052-0-30871";"Fan out! That thing can't have gone far!"
"115740052-0-30872";"Fan out? Why? I thought you didn't believe me?"
"115740052-0-30874";"Check down the hall. I'll see what I can find up ahead."
"115740052-0-30875";"There you are. Quickly, over here."
"115740052-0-30876";"A willing sacrifice. Very well, step forward and die!"
"115740052-0-30877";"An intruder. Mephala's brood will deal with you!"
"115740052-0-30879";"I won't let you ruin my big moment. I won't!"
"115740052-0-30887";"Give me the Oracle, mortal flea!"
"115740052-0-30894";"There you are. Come, follow me."
"115740052-0-30895";"Stop him … before he goes further through time …."
"115740052-0-30897";"Erudil! Ugh. What are you still doing here?"
"115740052-0-30898";"Glardir? Where in Tamriel have you been?"
"115740052-0-30899";"I told you before, Glardir's gone! You're so plain, Erudil! So boring!"
"115740052-0-30900";"Well there's no need for that …."
"115740052-0-30902";"Hurry, destroy the center fulcrum!"
"115740052-0-30903";"He's my son! I deserve to know what is going on!"
"115740052-0-30904";"I don't … I am sorry, but the Prosecution is still examining his body. We will release his remains to you as soon as we can."
"115740052-0-30907";"A hard thing to witness. There are rarely any happy endings in this line of work."
"115740052-0-30908";"You just have to remember that things would be much worse had you not been here. That matters."
"115740052-0-30910";"See that you do. It'd be a shame for so many sacrifices to be in vain."
"115740052-0-30911";"Ah, something is happening."
"115740052-0-30912";"Wyrd rituals aren't complicated. Just place the items in the proper bowls."
"115740052-0-30913";"You're too late. Once the crystal is made whole, I shall become infinite!"
"115740052-0-30914";"Meridia's power won't help you against me!"
"115740052-0-30915";"Rise, my champion! And this time, succeed where last you failed!"
"115740052-0-30916";"Your strength is impressive, but Transparent Law is almost whole. Now rise again, my champion!"
"115740052-0-30917";"Witness my unbridled power!"
"115740052-0-30918";"Master Vanus, is that you?"
"115740052-0-30919";"Still alive? Let's see if we can remedy that."
"115740052-0-30920";"The Court of Bedlam admires tenacity—but only to a point."
"115740052-0-30921";"Protect the weave, slay the intruder!"
"115740052-0-30922";"I love it when food presents itself."
"115740052-0-30923";"No … the tower crystal … was supposed to be … mine …."
"115740052-0-30924";"No!"
"115740052-0-30925";"The Crystal Tower … its defenses no longer keep me out! Are you here, my friend?"
"115740052-0-30927";"You … you did it. I knew it!"
"115740052-0-30932";"This way! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-30933";"Let's see if Erudil has found a solution yet."
"115740052-0-30934";"Does that mean we aren't in trouble?"
"115740052-0-30935";"I don't know. But now I'm hungry!"
"115740052-0-30937";"Eight, guide us."
"115740052-0-30939";"This one fails to understand. One must pay a fee for … unloading boxes?"
"115740052-0-30940";"A levy is imposed on any shipments that are due for commercial resale, yes. As designated by the proclamation of the Proxy Queen."
"115740052-0-30941";"And yet this one does not see High Elf merchants paying such tithes."
"115740052-0-30942";"The tariff is waived in the cases of vendors who have regularly traded in Alinor for decades."
"115740052-0-30943";"You mean that only new arrivals get taxed."
"115740052-0-30944";"The taxes fund our customs officers and ensure that only quality goods are brought into Summerset. As the goods of our High Elf vendors are above reproach, their exemption from the tax is only logical."
"115740052-0-30945";"Valam brought these spices all the way from Alabaster, and you say he must pay for the privilege to sell them? Did your queen open this land, or did she not?"
"115740052-0-30946";"We have complied with the Queen's proclamation. All visitors are welcome to our land. Their refuse, however, is not."
"115740052-0-30947";"As I have said, the Proxy Queen is unable to hold an audience with petitioners at this time. There are other affairs that require her attention."
"115740052-0-30948";"And when will your ever busy Proxy Queen see us?"
"115740052-0-30949";"Does she even intend on receiving our petitions? Or does she cast us aside, like the rest of you High Elves?"
"115740052-0-30950";"Many affairs compete for the Proxy Queen's attention. The complaints of newcomers do not rank as a matter of priority, simply put."
"115740052-0-30953";"How dare you dismiss me, as though I was some commoner! I refuse to leave this spot until my petition is heard."
"115740052-0-30954";"The same goes for me!"
"115740052-0-30955";"And me as well!"
"115740052-0-30956";"I never planned to come back here. The memories are … painful."
"115740052-0-30957";"I still can't believe I had to find you and drag you back. Was our time together really so terrible?"
"115740052-0-30958";"You still don't understand. Our daughter will never again see this view. Or hold my hand. Or … or … anything."
"115740052-0-30962";"But know, brothers and sisters, that the warmth of the et'Ada can reach even those who wrongly turn away from their light."
"115740052-0-30964";"Hello! Well met, friend!"
"115740052-0-30966";"Hmm? Pardon Shisuri, but … have we met before?"
"115740052-0-30967";"Well, no. But I was hoping to, ah, conduct some business of a … personal nature with you."
"115740052-0-30969";"This one has no idea what you're talking about. And why are you whispering?"
"115740052-0-30971";"Let's keep our voices down, shall we? I was wondering if you could help me with my sweet tooth, if you catch my drift."
"115740052-0-30972";"Ah. This one understands your meaning. You seek something for this sweet tooth of yours, yes?"
"115740052-0-30973";"Yes! Now, can you provide?"
"115740052-0-30974";"You don't deserve this book! It's mine!"
"115740052-0-30975";"You are very discerning to seek Shisuri out. After all, she has the finest sweet rolls in Alinor! Of course, if that's not what you seek, perhaps a guard could be of help?"
"115740052-0-30976";"Glardir, wait!"
"115740052-0-30978";"Guards? Uh, please excuse me. I must have mistaken you for someone else!"
"115740052-0-30982";"I'll explain everything later. For now, we need to hurry."
"115740052-0-30983";"Stay strong, Emile! I'll get you out of this!"
"115740052-0-30984";"Secure the prisoner in the Fighters Guild. Off you go."
"115740052-0-30985";"You there! Why are you interrogating Emile?"
"115740052-0-30987";"Well, I think that's quite enough. Next!"
"115740052-0-30988";"You can do this Ashala! You can—Oh, my stomach."
"115740052-0-30989";"Oh, curses!"
"115740052-0-30990";"Of all the rotten luck!"
"115740052-0-30991";"Whew."
"115740052-0-30992";"More newcomers? Unfortunately, the magic only affects those who have been prepared. But never fear. Your turn will come."
"115740052-0-30993";"Mother!"
"115740052-0-30994";"Hold there, Arathel! By order of the Divine Prosecution!"
"115740052-0-30995";"Easy, guardsman. This boy is under our protection."
"115740052-0-30996";"All of you, quiet! Have a word with our mutual friend, Talerion … if you want the truth, that is."
"115740052-0-30997";"Cages? These people did nothing to deserve such treatment."
"115740052-0-30998";"Oh, thank you for setting me free!"
"115740052-0-30999";"This way. I sense gathering energy up ahead."
"115740052-0-31000";"I want to help, Raz. Maybe this is the reason Meridia allowed me to escape when the rest of my sect was attacked."
"115740052-0-31002";"Daedric cultists?"
"115740052-0-31006";"You can't tame the sea!"
"115740052-0-31007";"It ends like it began. The two of us, adrift among the wreckage of our lives."
"115740052-0-31008";"But alive, and together."
"115740052-0-31009";"Fortune smiles, with a shark's teeth."
"115740052-0-31010";"Take notice, sewer-dwellers. I know where you are. Keep your affairs in order or our next encounter will be far less pleasant."
"115740052-0-31011";"Thank you so much for finding Arathel. Bless you!"
"115740052-0-31012";"I think I might want to be an adventurer too!"
"115740052-0-31013";"No. You've had quite enough adventure for one lifetime."
"115740052-0-31014";"Whoa … these poor creatures. Let's find out what Vinelore was doing with them."
"115740052-0-31015";"This should be all I need. Where did Talomar wander off to?"
"115740052-0-31018";"Talomar? Don't tell me he took off after Lotus alone. The inner paddocks are through there!"
"115740052-0-31019";"The pearl's draining these people!"
"115740052-0-31020";"I'll deal with the pearl, you hold off these creatures!"
"115740052-0-31024";"She's mad! Run while you can!"
"115740052-0-31025";"I see signs of the Court's work throughout Summerset, but nothing of the Court itself."
"115740052-0-31026";"I think the Court of Bedlam has fewer members than we imagined."
"115740052-0-31027";"Enough of this for now. Let's see what our friend has learned."
"115740052-0-31031";"I suddenly remembered some business I need to deal with as well. Feel free to pester the other guests in my absence."
"115740052-0-31032";"How dare you barge into my home without so much as a by your leave!"
"115740052-0-31034";"My Lady, one of the monks said to deliver this message. It's from the Aldarch himself."
"115740052-0-31035";"The Coral Forest? An odd location for a meeting, but I need to hear the Aldarch's explanation."
"115740052-0-31036";"Stop him!"
"115740052-0-31040";"Let's begin!"
"115740052-0-31041";"And we transition."
"115740052-0-31042";"And again. Keep time!"
"115740052-0-31043";"No, no, that won't do. Let us begin again. Observe my movements and match my speed."
"115740052-0-31044";"Our performance aligns! Impressive. Come, speak."
"115740052-0-31045";"The pearl's magic attracts these creatures. Hold them off while I complete my spell!"
"115740052-0-31046";"A-a true actor must know when to exit the stage! Farewell!"
"115740052-0-31047";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-31048";"Come on, let's talk outside."
"115740052-0-31049";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-31051";"Is it true? Is Admiral Viscarne dead?"
"115740052-0-31052";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-31053";"He is, but the rest is up to us. Let's move!"
"115740052-0-31054";"For Summerset! For Sunnawel! For Sunhold!"
"115740052-0-31055";"Well? Is it there?"
"115740052-0-31056";"Indeed it is. Yes, this should prove useful to our efforts."
"115740052-0-31057";"Thank Mauloch you're both all right!"
"115740052-0-31058";"Sunhold's fighting back! These sea snakes will fall beneath our blades!"
"115740052-0-31059";"We're not out of this yet. Let's split up and look for supplies."
"115740052-0-31062";"The Sea Elves are barely fighting back. What happened?"
"115740052-0-31063";"Didn't you hear? Someone killed Admiral Viscarne!"
"115740052-0-31064";"These sea snakes will pay for what they've done to our city!"
"115740052-0-31065";"Patience. We have to gather our forces first, build up our strength. Then we strike."
"115740052-0-31066";"Then we head for King's Haven. Cur and I will go to the eastern end of the pass and set up an ambush. You cut off their retreat."
"115740052-0-31067";"Hey! Leave me that leg if you're not going to finish it!"
"115740052-0-31068";"Here, girl. See if you can find our friend Tableau."
"115740052-0-31069";"She's caught a scent! Make sure to follow close behind. I'll keep back and guard our rear."
"115740052-0-31070";"Avast! You face Ularfire, the Thoroughly Unscrupulous! Come no closer, or I shall bestow a banquet of bladework upon thy body!"
"115740052-0-31071";"Quickly. Over here."
"115740052-0-31072";"Interesting. You weren't this attentive when our daughter actually needed you."
"115740052-0-31073";"Leythen, I—arrgh! I need to go check on the knight anyway."
"115740052-0-31074";"Val, wait …. Damn it."
"115740052-0-31075";"Damn. These papers are practically mulch, but maybe something survived. Help me look."
"115740052-0-31077";"Down here! I found something!"
"115740052-0-31078";"Not exactly cozy, but it's not completely demolished. Let's poke around."
"115740052-0-31079";"Gone … this camp looks recent though. I'll bet your missing persons just discovered that these ruins make decent shelter."
"115740052-0-31081";"Welcome to Corgrad, visitor. Such as it is. Forgive our lacking hospitality."
"115740052-0-31087";"You smell like a proper Nord battle maiden now!"
"115740052-0-31088";"""Milk drinker!' That's it! That's the voice! You've earned these tickets, Ambassador Rigurt!"
"115740052-0-31089";"Something about that statue catch your interest?"
"115740052-0-31090";"Ah, the rune is working perfectly! It's almost as if I'm standing right next to you."
"115740052-0-31092";"Refer to the book and use the rune again when you locate the ancient writing."
"115740052-0-31093";"The ancient inscription! You found it!"
"115740052-0-31094";"Something isn't right. I feel—"
"115740052-0-31095";"Our connection … breaking up! It's Nocturnal's earl—"
"115740052-0-31097";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-31098";"Now that Leythen's gone, we can talk freely."
"115740052-0-31100";"Go on without me. I'm going to speak with Arillas about my ancestors."
"115740052-0-31101";"Have you found the inscription?"
"115740052-0-31102";"Hmm, not yet, but the inscription is nearby. I sense something else, though. Nocturnal's presence."
"115740052-0-31103";"Wah? Hm? Who's there? Quiet down, you'll spook the fish!"
"115740052-0-31105";"Here. This is the place."
"115740052-0-31107";"Tell the Ritemaster. It's a spell of retrieval."
"115740052-0-31108";"Finally! I've reestablished my connection to the rune."
"115740052-0-31109";"Tell me what Nocturnal's earl said to you."
"115740052-0-31113";"I'm too stubborn to sink, Tenerive. That's why I was captain."
"115740052-0-31114";"There's one of the fonts."
"115740052-0-31115";"I don't suppose we could use this to blast Urlsar off the ramparts?"
"115740052-0-31116";"Sadly, no."
"115740052-0-31117";"Couldn't enjoy it from down here anyway."
"115740052-0-31118";"The last font is just ahead."
"115740052-0-31122";"Raz will see you later, when you return to Rellenthil."
"115740052-0-31123";"I think we can enter through these roots."
"115740052-0-31124";"I just wish I could have spent a few moments studying that inscription."
"115740052-0-31125";"Nedoril's mad!"
"115740052-0-31126";"He attacked Eldhon! And one of those horrible creatures tore off my hood!"
"115740052-0-31127";"So, let me clarify. We can't be together, in order for me to become an artist?"
"115740052-0-31128";"Yes. It is the only way for you to succeed."
"115740052-0-31129";"Fine! I'll become the greatest artist Summerset has ever known! And when I do, no one will dare question our relationship."
"115740052-0-31130";"I … what?"
"115740052-0-31131";"I haven't given up yet, Manacar. Not by a long shot."
"115740052-0-31132";"By Stendarr …."
"115740052-0-31133";"Are you sure you won't regret it? Being associated with a hulkynd?"
"115740052-0-31134";"I never have, not even for a moment. And I doubt I ever will."
"115740052-0-31135";"They'll never accept it. You'll be mocked. Shamed."
"115740052-0-31136";"What if I am? As long as I have you by my side, we can conquer anything. You'll see."
"115740052-0-31137";"I suppose … I suppose I will, won't I?"
"115740052-0-31138";"She saw an opportunity and she took it, Iachesis."
"115740052-0-31139";"Silence, Leythen! Need I put you in chains to remind you of your status here?"
"115740052-0-31140";"I'm sorry, Ritemaster. We should have asked permission. It won't happen again."
"115740052-0-31141";"Give me a moment. I'd like to chat with our friend."
"115740052-0-31142";"Of course. Then go to the Dreaming Cave. The Ritemaster's ready to begin."
"115740052-0-31143";"Good luck containing your experiments. We'll give your regards to the Queen."
"115740052-0-31144";"Cainar, listen to me!"
"115740052-0-31145";"Oriandra? Why are you in my head?"
"115740052-0-31146";"There's no time for research. You need to get out of there."
"115740052-0-31147";"And you need to ask permission before interrupting someone's thoughts!"
"115740052-0-31148";"But thank you for sending me an assistant. We'll collect those samples in no time!"
"115740052-0-31149";"Just hurry before the mind trap snaps shut!"
"115740052-0-31150";"It was an ambush. Admiral Viscarne has the Kinlady up ahead. You have to stop them!"
"115740052-0-31153";"Elise! I should have known you'd be behind this!"
"115740052-0-31154";"This isn't over, mongrel!"
"115740052-0-31155";"More of those yaghra creatures! Be careful."
"115740052-0-31156";"Talomar!"
"115740052-0-31157";"You'll all pay for this."
"115740052-0-31158";"Grog is close. Strange, I don't sense K'Tora's dark power, though."
"115740052-0-31159";"Hmm. I think he resisted the mind trap on his own, but he's still unconscious."
"115740052-0-31160";"Wake him up, please."
"115740052-0-31164";"Hey!"
"115740052-0-31165";"That wasn't just water …."
"115740052-0-31166";"No matter. It worked, didn't it?"
"115740052-0-31167";"And they wonder why I drink so much."
"115740052-0-31168";"Focus, Grog. Make your way back to Cainar and me."
"115740052-0-31169";"Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there."
"115740052-0-31170";"I've got Grog. You go find Miriya."
"115740052-0-31171";"The size of this place! It's almost as if someone dug up through the island."
"115740052-0-31172";"I'll teleport closer to the central area and meet you there."
"115740052-0-31173";"Oh, sorry! Sorry! It's safe over this way, follow me!"
"115740052-0-31174";"I don't think anything untoward's taken root here. Let's—uh, have a chat, shall we?"
"115740052-0-31175";"Remember to keep your cowl low, Miriya. Stay out of trouble. Be invisible. Survive."
"115740052-0-31176";"I will, Mama."
"115740052-0-31177";"Mama?"
"115740052-0-31178";"Miriya's losing herself. Find items she holds dear and help her remember."
"115740052-0-31179";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-31180";"Lotus! She's all right! Thank Jephre! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-31181";"You've been imprisoned in this mind trap by an entity called K'Tora. Its magic is powerful, but you're stronger than you know."
"115740052-0-31182";"There is no escape. I will break you in time. Watch as I turn your own memories against you!"
"115740052-0-31183";"You can't escape my mind trap! I'll destroy you with your darkest fears!"
"115740052-0-31184";"Not so fast, little worm! Let's see how you fare against this nightmare!"
"115740052-0-31185";"Is someone there? Help! Please, help!"
"115740052-0-31186";"Destroy the pearls! We can't let those creatures reach the surface."
"115740052-0-31187";"The Sea Sload and the hooded figure are gone. I'll try to determine where they disappeared to."
"115740052-0-31188";"This way. We're almost there."
"115740052-0-31189";"I offer you a place with us. A home, a family. If you promise to serve."
"115740052-0-31190";"I promise, Speaker. Show me the way."
"115740052-0-31191";"These memories represent turning points in Miriya's life. The choices that made her who she is. Help her remember!"
"115740052-0-31192";"I told you this is all just a misunderstand—friend! A little help?"
"115740052-0-31193";"What matters is that you found your way back, Miriya."
"115740052-0-31194";"You are an excellent student, and your mother would be proud of the person you've become."
"115740052-0-31195";"You aren't seriously taking his side in this?"
"115740052-0-31196";"I cannot be rid of this weevil soon enough."
"115740052-0-31197";"Free the prisoner."
"115740052-0-31198";"Eslion of Valenwood, you are under arrest for crimes against nature. You will be jailed until the court determines your punishment. Move along."
"115740052-0-31199";"Sorry! Really, truly sorry, I am! Won't happen again, officer."
"115740052-0-31200";"Crimes against nature! Insult to injury if ever there was!"
"115740052-0-31201";"Parah Voleisto … the past revealed …."
"115740052-0-31202";"Lainkah faloweh … future's door …."
"115740052-0-31203";"Parah Belain … the past revisited …."
"115740052-0-31204";"That was … disorienting."
"115740052-0-31205";"Cainar, bring Miriya here, please."
"115740052-0-31206";"If you insist. I'm not fully recovered yet, though, so this is probably my last spell for a while."
"115740052-0-31207";"Just do it. Our friend can return on—"
"115740052-0-31208";"He's really … tall."
"115740052-0-31209";"Knight of Meridia, stay and talk with me."
"115740052-0-31210";"Oriandra!"
"115740052-0-31211";"K'Tora's mind trap … I set it off …."
"115740052-0-31212";"What's wrong with her?"
"115740052-0-31213";"I think she's caught in a mind trap!"
"115740052-0-31214";"I guess I'll need to cast another spell after all."
"115740052-0-31215";"There! I've reestablished the mind link. Now go save Oriandra!"
"115740052-0-31216";"Listen closely. I've maintained our link, but just barely."
"115740052-0-31217";"I used the link to anchor part of myself to you."
"115740052-0-31218";"When the mind trap sends my darker aspects against you … kill them."
"115740052-0-31219";"That will destroy the mind trap and set me free."
"115740052-0-31220";"Trust me, it's the only way."
"115740052-0-31221";"Thank you. I'll see myself to safety. You need to rescue the others!"
"115740052-0-31222";"Is someone there? We need help!"
"115740052-0-31223";"There you are! Quickly, up the stairs. Take care of that thing before it takes care of us!"
"115740052-0-31225";"I need help down here!"
"115740052-0-31226";"Thank the Stars, I think he's coming to."
"115740052-0-31228";"Arrgh! Fine! Let our friend finish the interrogation."
"115740052-0-31229";"Did you find the keys? I'm feeling exposed out here."
"115740052-0-31231";"Oriandra, she's awake!"
"115740052-0-31232";"That's it. No more mind magic for me."
"115740052-0-31233";"A thousand gratitudes for aiding us."
"115740052-0-31234";"What about the mind traps? There might be more still out there."
"115740052-0-31235";"Sounds like a task we could dig our teeth into, my friends!"
"115740052-0-31236";"Indeed! I prefer to be the hunter instead of the prey!"
"115740052-0-31237";"Hey, what are you reading over there?"
"115740052-0-31240";"Hang on, Talomar. We'll get you out of here."
"115740052-0-31242";"Damn it, Talomar! You're going to reopen that wound."
"115740052-0-31244";"Hurry, now. The Ritemaster is waiting for you in the main gallery."
"115740052-0-31245";"Saviors! I've failed you! They've stolen our future, but I swear I'll rob them of theirs in kind!"
"115740052-0-31247";"My mind! It's coming apart!"
"115740052-0-31248";"Now remember your strength, your power. Take a weapon. Feel the weight in your hand."
"115740052-0-31250";"Ooh, a spooky clifftop estate. What a fine place for a breach. All sorts of ghastly things happened here, I can tell you that. I'd shudder if I had shoulders. I'm kidding of course—mortal fear is hilarious."
"115740052-0-31251";"My darkest aspects! You need to destroy them!"
"115740052-0-31252";"Such anger … such hatred!"
"115740052-0-31253";"I'm free! Use Cainar's link and I'll see you in the waking world."
"115740052-0-31254";"Another one! Defend yourself and strike back!"
"115740052-0-31255";"A magic-user! Interrupt the spell and retaliate!"
"115740052-0-31256";"The hero heard a rustling in the dark, then a savage snarl, as the beasts attacked!"
"115740052-0-31257";"Come, friends. It's time we commit our memories to the drink."
"115740052-0-31258";"Ah, there's a breach here. City's a bit gaudy, eh? At least by mortal standards. Where I come from, this would be little more than a privy. I'm kidding, of course. No one pees where I come from."
"115740052-0-31259";"More ruins. Hmm. You know, every stone tells a story. I mean that literally, by the way. That wall over there won't shut up about how much it hates rain. Let's find this breach and get out of here, eh?"
"115740052-0-31260";"This breach is in a zoo? Wow! You know, I'm endlessly fascinated by animals. They're a bit like walking plants, eh? Except with more, you know … fluids. Ugh, what a word that is!"
"115740052-0-31261";"A breach near the sea! I do love the ocean. It's a shame you can only see in three dimensions. All the quasi-tones and inverse number-forms …. Actually, I take it back—your meat-brain would explode if you saw this."
"115740052-0-31262";"I hear a breach nearby. You can't, can you? Count yourself lucky. Sounds like … a swarm of bees bouncing around in a tin bucket full of sleigh bells. Sort of like that racket bards make."
"115740052-0-31263";"Hmm. Breach nearby. I don't know why you're so intent on sealing them. Linear time is so overrated. Just imagine, you could die before you were even born! Wait … that's horrifying isn't it? I'm sorry. Never mind."
"115740052-0-31264";"Oh, you're going to love this one. I'm seeing a tiny island, surrounded by … it's either water or cats. Difficult to say. Let's hope it's the cats, eh?"
"115740052-0-31265";"You know coral's just weird sac-animal bones, right? So this is a bit like a cemetery, I guess. Ugh … you do not want to know what their ghosts look like! Old cheese—I'll leave it at that."
"115740052-0-31266";"How many more must die? These yaghra, there's no end to their numbers!"
"115740052-0-31267";"The Justiciar's holed herself up beyond the caverns. We'll have to fight through a whole horde of yaghra to reach the fetcher."
"115740052-0-31268";"These glan'nts think they can double cross me? I'll show them true suffering!"
"115740052-0-31269";"I'll wipe these ruins clean of this Sagacian filth! My name shall be honored! Revered!"
"115740052-0-31270";"Sea Elves. Fond of winged snakes and soggy chests. Noted …."
"115740052-0-31271";"Fair enough. So … where to? I assume you've got a map or something?"
"115740052-0-31272";"Oh now what is all this mess?"
"115740052-0-31273";"I'll find you as soon as the diamond keys are ready to use."
"115740052-0-31274";"Well this is picturesque, eh? Aside from all the imps and such. Did you know that imps have belly-buttons? Please don't ask me why!"
"115740052-0-31275";"Another breach near that tree, I think. Fun fact—all deciduous trees love accordion music. Just more proof that all trees are idiots."
"115740052-0-31276";"Ugh … zombies. You ever try to talk to a zombie? They won't let you get a word in edgewise! Just groan this, and moan that! Let's find this breach and leave, eh?"
"115740052-0-31277";"Another breach by the sea! Ship's seen better days, eh? It's like I always say—the only thing you should make out of wood is nothing. Wood is ridiculous."
"115740052-0-31278";"You are no Keeper! Don't you see what she has done? I will not let you free her!"
"115740052-0-31279";"Hmm …. I'm seeing a breach by a waterfall. Or maybe a flight of very wet stairs. Stairs are a bit silly, eh? Why not just flip gravity and fall up?"
"115740052-0-31280";"Definitely a breach here, mate. Say, I was thinking—maybe we should get something for Josajeh to cheer her up! I'm thinking meat of some variety. You meat-brains like meat, right?"
"115740052-0-31281";"You're doing that thing where water squirts out of your skin, aren't you? Sweating, eh? Ugh. And you people think I'm weird! Let's find this breach and cool off."
"115740052-0-31282";"Ah, look! Yokudan ruins. You know the Yokudans could make magic idea-swords using nothing but their brains? Bit of a waste, that. I'd have made a very comfortable chair."
"115740052-0-31283";"Hmm …. Yeah, there's a breach nearby. Say, did you know there are six and a half quadrillion grains of sand in the Alik'r? Oh, come on. Don't act like you're not impressed!"
"115740052-0-31284";"It's time to move out! The Battlereeve must be informed about this."
"115740052-0-31285";"Keep watch, soldier. I will be back with reinforcements."
"115740052-0-31286";"See what the scrying pool reveals! There's something happening on the beach!"
"115740052-0-31287";"It's the yaghra, they're invading Artaeum!"
"115740052-0-31288";"The pearl! Somehow it was used to summon the yaghra! We need to defend the beach!"
"115740052-0-31289";"Looks like a buyer's market around here, eh? Got to tell you, I see a lot of potential, mate. Lava-front views, open floor-plan, plenty of ventilation …. It's a gold mine!"
"115740052-0-31290";"Definitely a breach nearby. And ooh, it's a rowdy one! This place is tense, eh? Might have something to do with the mountains strangling each other. Who's to say?"
"115740052-0-31291";"What a view! Aside from the coral over there. Be glad your silly face-holes can't smell colors. Ugh! That orange! It smells like … old figs fell out of an ogre's bottom. Let's find this breach, eh?"
"115740052-0-31292";"I failed you … little sister."
"115740052-0-31293";"The Golden Knight and his sword can wait. The yaghra are our primary concern."
"115740052-0-31294";"Follow the Ritemaster. I'll portal myself and meet you there."
"115740052-0-31295";"Breach ho, mate! While you look, I will regale you with a hilarious joke! What do you call a lygosmotic dream-wave on its birthday? A ventswattle! Get it? A ventswattle? Oh, never mind."
"115740052-0-31296";"Attention! Thanks to my securing of additional funds, you may now take a reprieve! Stop work immediately!"
"115740052-0-31297";"Eh—excuse me! I have been induced—rather, enlightened—by this, ah, kind individual to permit a cessation of labor. Please do so!"
"115740052-0-31298";"Snow! Can we make a snow-thing? Snow-person? Whatever? You know, if you make it right, it develops a sad little soul! 'Course it melts later. Bit of a shame, that. But we can name it and everything!"
"115740052-0-31299";"Be careful around here, mate. This breach is surrounded by trolls. They're a lot smarter than you think. They're banging rocks together now, sure—but once they start wearing pants? Look out."
"115740052-0-31300";"To Oblivion with this work! I will take part in it no longer!"
"115740052-0-31301";"What are you—wait! Return this instant!"
"115740052-0-31302";"I set it down over there."
"115740052-0-31303";"So, Staff of Towers, eh? Lots of peril there, mate. I've got to admit, though, I'm very excited to see how it turns out! I'd say, what? Sixty-percent chance time folds inside-out? We'll see!"
"115740052-0-31304";"This stream's a pleasant enough place for a breach. Just watch out for beavers, eh? Sure, they look friendly enough—but they're just little, waddling balls of hatred. Seriously!"
"115740052-0-31305";"Another breach ahead, mate. Uh oh. I see many, many stairs in our future. Well, your future. No legs, remember? But don't worry—I'll be right behind you … doing very little."
"115740052-0-31306";"Let's do this again some time, eh?"
"115740052-0-31307";"Ridiculous? I'll show you what's ridiculous. I'll show you all!"
"115740052-0-31308";"Mephala has sealed this place, mortal flea!"
"115740052-0-31309";"Wait! Is that a sword?"
"115740052-0-31311";"That would be mine. I'm on my way to help. Eventually."
"115740052-0-31312";"My word, the vision showed us the Dawnbreaker! I'm almost positive."
"115740052-0-31313";"What do you mean you lost the map?"
"115740052-0-31314";"I didn't lose it. I … threw it in the water."
"115740052-0-31315";"Why would you do that?"
"115740052-0-31316";"Because it wasn't helping!"
"115740052-0-31317";"We'll never find the ship at this rate."
"115740052-0-31318";"We could always walk to Sunhold."
"115740052-0-31319";"What if the fleet's left already?"
"115740052-0-31320";"Oh, come on. Like we're going to miss the whole invasion."
"115740052-0-31321";"I think I've figured a way out of this."
"115740052-0-31322";"Steal some clothes and try to blend in?"
"115740052-0-31323";"We kill you and use your bloated corpse as a raft?"
"115740052-0-31324";"If you're just going to mock me, forget it."
"115740052-0-31325";"More intruders? Excellent. You'll be nice additions to my soldiers."
"115740052-0-31329";"Please, uh, forgive me. My lady. Uh, I mean, my kinlady. It was my fault."
"115740052-0-31330";"My apologies. Daedric interference and Artaeum's own defenses delayed my arrival."
"115740052-0-31331";"A champion of Meridia? At least he was helpful."
"115740052-0-31334";"Ha …. You fools. I will return …."
"115740052-0-31335";"Did Captain Kitty-Cat hire you to take me out? The fool! I've found true power."
"115740052-0-31336";"A Dwarf hold! Ha. What a silly bunch they were! Always whacking sprockets with their little baby hammers—toiling away on their tiny brass xylophones …. Good riddance, eh?"
"115740052-0-31337";"Breach around here somewhere. Oh, and by the way, Celarus has no idea what he's doing with that staff. Ah well. Dragon Breaks aren't so bad. Ha! I'm joking. They're horrific, mate."
"115740052-0-31338";"Well, someone had to kill her. Vareda didn't just up and die at the tender age of twenty-eight!"
"115740052-0-31339";"Hmm. Rocks. Water. More rocks … wait! That's it. Breach nearby, mate. Sorry. I just got distracted by all the behemoth mind-snails. It's too bad you can't see them. They're really cute. Sort of."
"115740052-0-31340";"Breach ahead. Say, what is it with you bipeds and waterfalls? A deluge of happy water-spirits cast to their doom, smashed to bits on the sullen rocks below. Hardly a recipe for romance, mate!"
"115740052-0-31341";"Stop squawking, you fat netch. You're just as likely the one that killed her!"
"115740052-0-31342";"I did this then? When you're the one greedier than a starving horker?"
"115740052-0-31343";"There's a breach here somewhere. Plenty of Elf-ghosts too. Ugh. They won't stop shrieking about … it's either dying or pieing. Pieing's a word, right? To pie? Odd thing to get upset about."
"115740052-0-31344";"This is going nowhere. We'll never find the treasure if we keep killing each other!"
"115740052-0-31345";"Dreugh? Ugh. I'm telling you, mate, they used to be a lot more pleasant. Now these land dreugh are all crab-faced and stabby. Shame. Let's find this breach and move on, eh?"
"115740052-0-31346";"Submit to K'Garza! Her power is unbeatable! Unstoppable!"
"115740052-0-31347";"Ha …. Do you think you've seen the last of me …?"
"115740052-0-31348";"Breach in that Argonian settlement, I think. I love Argonian architecture. Who needs nails and hard angles? Just pile up some slop and call it a house!"
"115740052-0-31349";"Hmm. These ruins are dripping with old intention, mate. Forgotten dreamforms, frothing hour-beasts …. Great place for a blood-ritual. Or a very unsettling birthday party."
"115740052-0-31350";"Yeah, there's a breach here somewhere. And something's eating it? I certainly wouldn't recommend that. Unless you're really anxious to get sucked through your own belly-button."
"115740052-0-31351";"Easy now. You did well."
"115740052-0-31353";"Witness the power of K'Tora of the Abyssal Cabal!"
"115740052-0-31354";"Now, let's see what we're working with here …."
"115740052-0-31355";"Back, worm! This does not concern the likes of you."
"115740052-0-31356";"Can't you bleed any faster, Igeke?"
"115740052-0-31358";"Indeed! My being roils with anticipation!"
"115740052-0-31359";"What the—there's just a scroll in here! ""I sailed across many seas, and raided many ships. But the most precious treasure is family. May you see the wisdom in these words."""
"115740052-0-31360";"What? I came all this way for nothing? I can't believe I poisoned Vareda for a stupid scroll!"
"115740052-0-31361";"Hold a moment—you killed Vareda? But I was the one who strangled her, right after she fell asleep!"
"115740052-0-31362";"Neither of you are making any sense. I stabbed her. Right after we doused the fire!"
"115740052-0-31363";"Wait. Did—did we all kill Vareda to get a bigger share of the treasure?"
"115740052-0-31364";"Ha! I suppose betrayal runs in the family!"
"115740052-0-31365";"Ok, I've got this…"
"115740052-0-31366";"And, Go!"
"115740052-0-31367";"Oh, not you again."
"115740052-0-31368";"Wait, where are you-? Aw, you ruined it!"
"115740052-0-31369";"What is going on? It was just a spider …."
"115740052-0-31370";"Ah, good. The link is working perfectly!"
"115740052-0-31371";"There's Cainar. You need to convince him that this is all an illusion."
"115740052-0-31372";"Siroria …. Siroria! No!"
"115740052-0-31373";"Now, now. If you're not going to play fair, neither am I."
"115740052-0-31374";"No! I can't … fall … like this!"
"115740052-0-31375";"I'm sorry Olorime … we failed you."
"115740052-0-31376";"How does it feel Olorime? To see your companions die?"
"115740052-0-31377";"Curse you, Z'Maja! You'll never get away with this!"
"115740052-0-31378";"I suppose poor Galenwe wasn't so useful after all."
"115740052-0-31379";"How could I … be so … foolish?"
"115740052-0-31380";"We'll avenge your death, Galenwe! I swear it!"
"115740052-0-31381";"Then came a bellow, and a blast of chill wind! The hero's fate was sealed!"
"115740052-0-31382";"Ugh! You just won't stop, will you?"
"115740052-0-31383";"Cease your struggles. Your memories belong to K'Tora now."
"115740052-0-31384";"I am as patient and enduring as the sea, worm. Now reveal the hiding place!"
"115740052-0-31385";"Your mind is my mind, Iachesis. Reveal your memories to me!"
"115740052-0-31386";"Such an effort to escape me …. I suppose I have what I need."
"115740052-0-31388";"Well done! Now return to Cainar and convince him to wake up."
"115740052-0-31389";"The mage is caught in my mind trap, worm! Nothing you do will change that."
"115740052-0-31390";"Next, you need to free the Orc warrior named Grog. He should be deeper in the ruins."
"115740052-0-31391";"There's no time to mourn now. Quickly, let's move on."
"115740052-0-31392";"There's Miriya. Be careful in there. I sense her mind trap is nearly complete."
"115740052-0-31394";"Touch the Ul'vor Staff and enter the mindscape!"
"115740052-0-31395";"Nubani! There you are. Renzir knew you would escape."
"115740052-0-31396";"With no help from her coward husband, of course."
"115740052-0-31397";"Oh, do not say such things. Especially on such a day, when all has been lost."
"115740052-0-31398";"Oh? But we still have the ship. We'll sell it in the nearest harbor, yes? Buy a little shop, just as you promised?"
"115740052-0-31399";"Well, yes. Of course. Though, perhaps, we find sailors? Who wish for work?"
"115740052-0-31400";"Renzir …."
"115740052-0-31401";"Yes, yes! We sell the ship! Of course. We start a shop, just as you wish."
"115740052-0-31402";"Good."
"115740052-0-31403";"Nubani! Renzir is so pleased to see you unharmed."
"115740052-0-31404";"Yes, this one escaped. No thanks to her coward husband."
"115740052-0-31405";"Do not say such things, when Renzir has such great news!"
"115740052-0-31406";"Good news?"
"115740052-0-31407";"The day has come. This one will give up his life on the high seas, and settle down."
"115740052-0-31408";"Truly? We will open the shop, as you've always promised?"
"115740052-0-31409";"Yes. What use has Renzir for treasure, when he has you by his side?"
"115740052-0-31410";"Renzir …. This one has never been more happy."
"115740052-0-31412";"Use the link and get out of there!"
"115740052-0-31413";"Nubani! Renzir's treasure, his love, his wife!"
"115740052-0-31414";"Yes, here she is. And unharmed, too. No thanks to her coward husband."
"115740052-0-31415";"Do not say such things, when all has gone so well! With these items, Renzir will rebuild his operation."
"115740052-0-31416";"Again, you say such things? You promise Nubani, tomorrow, tomorrow. But always we sail again!"
"115740052-0-31417";"Have patience! Soon we shall retire in luxury, dearest one."
"115740052-0-31418";"Nubani must have the patience of a saint, to put up with you."
"115740052-0-31419";"Ah, but still. You love Renzir, do you not?"
"115740052-0-31420";"Unfortunately."
"115740052-0-31421";"I think there's a breach here. Hard to say with all these Ayleid ruins lying about. You would not believe how many ghosts are asking me for favors right now. Ghosts, am I right? They're never satisfied!"
"115740052-0-31422";"You dare enter my domain, worm?"
"115740052-0-31423";"Definitely another breach here, mate. First rule of finding rifts in time: always check the creepy, decrepit towers first."
"115740052-0-31424";"Gil-Var-Delle. Of course a breach pops up here. You know that blowhard, Molag Bal, sat on this place a while back, right? Or stepped on it or something … I don't know. Anyway, be careful!"
"115740052-0-31425";"Looks like there's another breach here in what can only laughingly be called a maze. All right, mate: if you get lost in this thing, I'm going to have to take a long, hard look at our relationship."
"115740052-0-31426";"There's definitely a breach around here somewhere, meat-brain. You don't mind me calling you meat-brain, do you? I mean, as mundane physical brains go, you're really top of the class!"
"115740052-0-31427";"Wow. Lots of people gathering around this breach. Odd … they've all got little tails. Wait, wait, I get it now. They're monkeys! I'm telling you, mate, it's impossible to tell you all apart!"
"115740052-0-31428";"More than a few snakes around this breach, mate. Ugh. Surly little beasts … always wiggling along with no arms or legs. I don't have arms or legs either, but you don't see me biting people."
"115740052-0-31429";"Breach ahead. That Celarus is a real stick in the tree, eh? Er … stick in the dirt? Or something? Look, I can't keep track of all your ridiculous idioms. It doesn't even make any sense …."
"115740052-0-31430";"Might want to hurry, mate. That boney gem-collector, Molag Bal, has his eyes on this breach. Bit of a cat-lady, that one, eh? Stuffing his plane full of sad little souls … It's a mess is what it is."
"115740052-0-31431";"You can't resist forever. The Heart of Transparent Law will be mine!"
"115740052-0-31432";"Follow me!"
"115740052-0-31433";"You again? All right, follow me."
"115740052-0-31434";"Definitely a breach around here, mate. High up, I think …. Or what passes for high around here, anyway."
"115740052-0-31435";"Take a look around those standing stones, eh? What is it with tipping stones, anyway? Didn't your ancestors have anything better to do? That's the problem with you bipeds. You never apply yourselves."
"115740052-0-31436";"Another breach tucked away in an old Breton ruin. Don't see many of those around, do you? Ha! You know they built it over an Ayleid ruin, right? Can't wait to see what people build on top of this!"
"115740052-0-31437";"Ah, pastoral bliss! I'd make a fine farmer. Breeding dumb animals, making them work for nothing, slaughtering them in their prime …. Hmm. Sounds a bit worse when you say it out loud, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-31438";"Best find this breach before the tide comes in. Water's full of brain-billies: little spirit-jellies that sting people's memories. Don't believe me? Think of that time you wet your pants. Ha! Hurts, right?"
"115740052-0-31439";"Another breach out there. Maybe we should leave this one be, you know? Honestly, what's the worst that could happen? Wait—I'm not encouraging you to ask me that question. The answer is very graphic."
"115740052-0-31440";"Yech. Vampires. Pays to not have a neck sometimes, eh? Blood too, I guess. 'Course if you see any antipodal math-grabbers you'll let me know, right? They'd just love to get a bite of me!"
"115740052-0-31441";"Breach webbed up around here somewhere. Spiders are so adorable. Look at us! We've got eight little spindly arms—isn't that scary? Show me something with eight thousand arms, then maybe I'll get nervous."
"115740052-0-31442";"This one's deep, deep down, mate. Kind of like my general expectations of you meat-brains. But you? Oh, you've far exceeded them! Not hard to do when they're practically nonexistent, but still. Kudos!"
"115740052-0-31443";"Vanquish the guardians to reveal each protected memory. You'll weaken K'Tora and learn something at the same time."
"115740052-0-31444";"The Ritemaster's waking up. You need to press on!"
"115740052-0-31446";"The pearl. It's the key to escaping this mind trap."
"115740052-0-31447";"Well done! Now destroy the pearl and wake up."
"115740052-0-31448";"Learn the rules and challenge me properly. Then I'll teach you some manners."
"115740052-0-31449";"Ah, Craglorn. Ever seen this many crags in one place? Its cup runneth over with crags. Not as many lorns as you'd expect, though. Biped naming habits could use some work, mate."
"115740052-0-31450";"Plenty of history hereabouts. Perfect place for a breach. Just look out for gargoyles, eh? Ugly squatters. Always cluttering up the place—ruining the timeworn aesthetic. They're an eyesore, you know?"
"115740052-0-31451";"Breach ahead. Say, you think Josajeh's all right? I can't always tell. Your weird little faces scrunch up when you're upset, but then you bare your teeth when you're happy. It's a puzzler."
"115740052-0-31452";"I can't believe this is our last outing! I feel like we've really bonded, you know? Not on a sticky alchemical level, or anything. That would be very weird. You know what I mean. I'm going to miss this!"
"115740052-0-31453";"There's a breach here, mate. I'm seeing a bridge … or maybe a flat sideways tower people can walk on? I guess they're kind of the same thing. Only having three dimensions does make things simpler."
"115740052-0-31454";"Watch your step around here, mate. This arena is what we in the dimension-hopping community call a ""really bad idea door."" Daedric mischief for sure. Let's find this breach and go, all right?"
"115740052-0-31455";"As you wish, Ritemaster. I shall travel to Lillandril immediately."
"115740052-0-31456";"And I'll send word to the Eye of the Queen."
"115740052-0-31458";"Don't listen! Her words are poison!"
"115740052-0-31459";"Her heart is twisted! She deserves this fate!"
"115740052-0-31460";"Look at what her power wrought! Lock her away!"
"115740052-0-31461";"You were trying to save her. I know that. It was just … damn it, we need to win this, Val."
"115740052-0-31462";"Come along. The Royal Chef makes a rabbit meatball pie that you'll absolutely devour."
"115740052-0-31463";"You're okay turning a blade on your own? There's no way to avoid it."
"115740052-0-31464";"I have a suggestion for our next move."
"115740052-0-31465";"I bet Nocturnal knows we're coming. So much for the element of surprise."
"115740052-0-31466";"Where's Vile's Hound? Has he abandoned us already?"
"115740052-0-31468";"This is it, Cas. Last chance to—"
"115740052-0-31469";"Don't try to talk me out of this, Pan."
"115740052-0-31470";"You remember our vows?"
"115740052-0-31471";"They were the only thing that kept us moored through that miserable storm."
"115740052-0-31472";"Cas! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-31473";"T1152 Mage Build VO"
"115740052-0-31474";"That was beautiful, Curtaros. She would have loved it. I never knew you could sing."
"115740052-0-31475";"The old man is full of surprises."
"115740052-0-31476";"Heh …. And thus the play continues. I'll see you … soon."

"115740052-0-31480";"I sense … this way!"
"115740052-0-31481";"Let's leave these Psijics to their work. We have a college to put back together."
"115740052-0-31482";"A dead end? Did we make a wrong turn?"
"115740052-0-31483";"Wait. The tower … it's moving. Fascinating! It appears to be reconfiguring itself!"
"115740052-0-31484";"Then let's get moving before the tower remakes this platform out of existence!"
"115740052-0-31485";"I expect we'll see more evidence of this malleable nature the higher we climb."
"115740052-0-31486";"Look at this place! Part of the ceiling has fallen in!"
"115740052-0-31487";"Yes, but what happened to the shadow Sapiarchs? They were thick as crows on the lower levels."
"115740052-0-31488";"New arrivals? I wasn't told to expect any students or scholars today."
"115740052-0-31491";"Stay… stay back!"
"115740052-0-31492";"Really? A walking volcano?"
"115740052-0-31493";"Nocturnal's started to repair Transparent Law. Soon none of this will matter."
"115740052-0-31494";"No, you mustn't do this!"
"115740052-0-31496";"You can't reason with crazy, Leythen. Besides, we've got company!"
"115740052-0-31497";"Why do you insist on prolonging your pain, Leythen?"
"115740052-0-31498";"You know nothing about pain!"
"115740052-0-31499";"A pity. I thought we were the same. No matter. Your quest ends here."
"115740052-0-31500";"Enough! Just hand over the damn key!"
"115740052-0-31501";"She's just trying to slow us down. Meet up at the gate pedestal!"
"115740052-0-31502";"How observant, knight."
"115740052-0-31504";"Interesting. Raz saw one just like it in a shop in Skywatch."
"115740052-0-31505";"Try the key pedestal."
"115740052-0-31506";"Ah. It seems the hunt must go on. Please excuse me."
"115740052-0-31507";"Very well. You are free to go—just do not give me cause to regret this decision."
"115740052-0-31508";"If you'll excuse me, I was tired of standing here anyway."
"115740052-0-31509";"I wondered if you'd actually show yourself instead of just projecting menacing images."
"115740052-0-31510";"I have to stop you here. All of you."
"115740052-0-31511";"No, but this will keep you busy for a time."
"115740052-0-31513";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-31514";"Thank goodness."
"115740052-0-31515";"Come with me. You're sleeping this off."
"115740052-0-31516";"Come along. My superiors will want a word with you."
"115740052-0-31517";"Where'd they go?"
"115740052-0-31521";"Well, now that that's settled, me and this tree have some cuddling to get to."
"115740052-0-31522";"Is Leythen … gone?"
"115740052-0-31523";"Oh? Look who's forward now! I knew you were sweet on me!"
"115740052-0-31524";"If either of you ever come to Black Marsh, let me return the hospitality!"
"115740052-0-31526";"That should keep her busy … for a short time, at least."
"115740052-0-31527";"Um, why are you glowing?"
"115740052-0-31528";"I didn't see him escape, but I held out hope. I'm sorry, old friend …."
"115740052-0-31529";"A vanishing bookcase! Raz likes this clever sage!"
"115740052-0-31530";"My illusion spell! Who … who are you?"
"115740052-0-31531";"May your bones bleach on barren sands … damned fool."
"115740052-0-31532";"You won't get past my splendid webs, mortal!"
"115740052-0-31533";"Too late! The Mistress has already claimed her prize …."
"115740052-0-31534";"Initiate! Something terrible has occurred. Return to Artaeum at once!"
"115740052-0-31535";"I use this staff to make right what once went wrong!"
"115740052-0-31536";"Josajeh! You're alive!"
"115740052-0-31537";"I fully expected more chaos. I see our newest member has the situation well in hand."
"115740052-0-31538";"They've been invaluable to this effort, Relicmaster."
"115740052-0-31539";"That is quite clear. Celarus, see to your apprentice. I shall recover the Staff of Towers."
"115740052-0-31540";"Yes, of course."
"115740052-0-31541";"I'll see to Josajeh's welfare and ensure the staff is recovered. Return to Artaeum when you are ready."
"115740052-0-31542";"So, what did Celarus say? Am I free to travel the world? I'm ready for another adventure!"
"115740052-0-31543";"The portal! We're heading to the portal to leave Artaeum? Oh, I can't tell you how happy this makes me, mate!"
"115740052-0-31544";"Wait, why are we going to the vault? Why would we—oh."
"115740052-0-31545";"Well, I'm sure you did what you could, eh? I know you'd never let this happen if you had a choice."
"115740052-0-31546";"I can't stand the idea of getting trapped in that vault again. Maybe I'll go to sleep. Yeah, a good long slumber to wash away the sadness."
"115740052-0-31547";"Thanks for giving me at least a taste of freedom before the end. So long, mate."
"115740052-0-31548";"I'm so sorry for disappointing you, loremaster."
"115740052-0-31549";"Nocturnal's realm. We've got to be nearing the top of this damn thing."
"115740052-0-31550";"It is as I always said, Josajeh. Failure is an opportunity for growth. I hope this exile will lead you to better things."
"115740052-0-31551";"Meridia's magic is gone. The blade isn't yours anymore, either."
"115740052-0-31552";"I've got this. You talk to that Sapiarch."
"115740052-0-31554";"Join Meridia in my eternal darkness!"
"115740052-0-31555";"Let the cat fight those monsters! I'm getting out of here!"
"115740052-0-31556";"The island's sprung a leak! Run!"
"115740052-0-31557";"Farewell."
"115740052-0-31558";"I must return to the Eldbur Ruins to the north and aid the others caught in K'Tora's mind trap. If you find yourself in the area, you might be able to assist me. Stay safe and remember you have a friend in the Psijic Order!"
"115740052-0-31559";"Raz enjoys a good fight as much as the next cat, but these are horrible creatures!"
"115740052-0-31560";"I don't understand. Why didn't the sword protect me?"
"115740052-0-31562";"Are … are those creatures … newcomers? They're hideous!"
"115740052-0-31563";"Because Dawnbreaker was never intended for you."
"115740052-0-31564";"Z'Maja is defeated but …. My companions. My friends. All gone …."
"115740052-0-31565";"I won't allow their sacrifice to be in vain. I'll make sure the Welkynar traditions live on."
"115740052-0-31566";"I'll rebuild my order, and keep protecting Summerset. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-31567";"We'll see about that."
"115740052-0-31568";"No!"
"115740052-0-31569";"Five-claw! You always arrive just when Raz needs you most!"
"115740052-0-31570";"Hmm. Hasn't been slept in. Such a waste of a perfectly good bed."
"115740052-0-31571";"Raz recognizes a hidden code when he sees one!"
"115740052-0-31573";"Over here! We need to talk!"
"115740052-0-31574";"Feel the crushing weight of your own insignificance!"
"115740052-0-31575";"You shall be eradicated … forgotten."
"115740052-0-31576";"My memory shields! You destroyed them!"
"115740052-0-31577";"You fight well, but in this mindscape I reign supreme!"
"115740052-0-31578";"Sorry about all of this."
"115740052-0-31579";"Z'Maja is defeated! My friends, now is the time to reclaim your strength!"
"115740052-0-31580";"Quickly, absorb the shadow taken from you!"
"115740052-0-31581";"My friends, we're all alive! We all can fight! And together, there's nothing we can't do."
"115740052-0-31582";"You're right, as usual. I swear to never give up on our order, as long as there's breath in my lungs! You can count on that."
"115740052-0-31583";"Olorime, my power … it hasn't recovered. I'm not sure if it ever will. I'm not sure … if I can still fight by your side."
"115740052-0-31584";"Well, when you put it like that …. I have always been an excellent mentor."
"115740052-0-31586";"Olorime, whatever happened to me has … drained me of my power. I doubt I'll ever recover. An early retirement for me, I suppose."
"115740052-0-31587";"Quite the proposal you have there. Well, we may not have very good odds but … we'll make do. Of that, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-31588";"We've defeated Z'Maja, but at what cost?"
"115740052-0-31589";"No … no, we can't give up hope now! I know we can rebuild our order. Together."
"115740052-0-31590";"We'll train a new generation to protect Summerset, stronger than before!"
"115740052-0-31592";"I agree. It's now time for us to reclaim our power!"
"115740052-0-31593";"Finally, my flame burns once more!"
"115740052-0-31594";"Never have I seen such a resounding victory! The bards shall sing of this day."
"115740052-0-31595";"I feel my power again as well. The Welkynars shall continue on!"
"115740052-0-31596";"Let's save the victory speech for later, Relequen."
"115740052-0-31597";"Yes, though I can't say the same for Cloudrest. The city may never recover."
"115740052-0-31599";"You don't have to do this! Please!"
"115740052-0-31600";"Is that a tomb? Don't put me in there! Please! No—No!"
"115740052-0-31601";"I must talk with my sister, but feel free to visit me in the Manor of Masques. I'd love to have a chat, anytime."
"115740052-0-31603";"Is that a … Skaafin?"
"115740052-0-31604";"So, you know where we're going now, right? Good. You take me to a time breach, and I'll help you spot it. Hmm. This bag's a bit snug, eh?"
"115740052-0-31605";"Our family's reputation is going to tatters! Get up, you oaf!"
"115740052-0-31606";"No, Puhnara. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-31608";"Ha! Any mother of a wastrel like you knows not to keep expectations of any sort."
"115740052-0-31609";"I've been wanting to see how the latest serum performs in live tests. Let's find out."
"115740052-0-31610";"You'll be the first to be purified by divine wrath!"
"115740052-0-31611";"Auri-El! Lead me from this forsaken place."
"115740052-0-31612";"Another unworthy specimen. I'll finish you myself."
"115740052-0-31613";"Here you are again. I thought such an outcome likely."
"115740052-0-31614";"Is that actually a member of the Psijic Order?"
"115740052-0-31615";"It must be. There must be something important going on to bring them out of hiding."
"115740052-0-31616";"Everyone's gathered in the council chamber. You should go inside."
"115740052-0-31617";"Your aid was acceptable."
"115740052-0-31619";"I will vouch for this adventurer. While I was blinded by prejudice and hate, their actions saved Shimmerene."
"115740052-0-31620";"The Divine Prosecution recognizes this adventurer's efforts to maintain the peace. I can personally attest that they saved Cey-Tarn Keep from a Daedric cult."
"115740052-0-31621";"Alchemy vouches for this adventurer! Within our troupe, loyalty and trust come before all. This brave hero has demonstrated those qualities a thousand times over."
"115740052-0-31622";"As the Battlereeve of Alinor, I support only those who deserve it. This adventurer, at great risk, gathered vital information about the Sea Sload and helped save Summerset."
"115740052-0-31623";"Sapiarch, you know me. My son rejected the Queen's decree and suffered the consequences. This newcomer saved Rellenthil."
"115740052-0-31624";"Though the Sapiarchs and Mages Guild do not always see eye-to-eye, you know my reputation. This adventurer saved my life and I affirm their bravery and honor."
"115740052-0-31625";"Finally, Raz must add his voice to the chorus. No one has served our Queen and our island as well as this adventurer. Not even Raz!"
"115740052-0-31626";"Razum-dar … remove your furry seat from our throne."
"115740052-0-31627";"After all Raz has done for Queen and country, you would deny him this small comfort?"
"115740052-0-31628";"Why cousin Ayrenn tolerates you, we'll never understand."
"115740052-0-31629";"Enjoy yourself, my friend! Raz certainly plans to."
"115740052-0-31630";"Our throne, Razum-dar. We would have it back now."
"115740052-0-31631";"So tense, your majesty! Must be this uncomfortable throne. Perhaps Raz could suggest a most comfortable cushion upon which you could sit."
"115740052-0-31635";"That sounds like a wild nixad chase. Didn't Razum-dar mention he was investigating Daedric cults on Summerset? Maybe you should go talk to him."
"115740052-0-31636";"Another graveyard? All kinds of treasures tucked away in the dirt here, mate. We could find that staff piece, sure. But wouldn't you rather dig up an old pelvis? No? Eh, your loss."
"115740052-0-31637";"Well, well. It's the Adamantine shard. Have a care where you drop that thing, eh? This bag's stuffed as it is!"
"115740052-0-31638";"The ruins of Leki's Blade. Really gets you thinking, eh? About mortality. The long, slow march of time … the grim inevitability of death, decay, and obscurity. Phew! Glad I don't have to worry about that!"
"115740052-0-31639";"The Orichalc fragment! Don't hear much about the Orichalc Tower anymore, but it was always my favorite. I love ugly, sunken, long-forgotten things."
"115740052-0-31640";"Shadowfen? Ugh. The Hist are insufferable. Honestly, if they're so smart, why can't they stop leaking their sap all over the place? Don't drop me in there, by the way. Stuff's impossible to wash off."
"115740052-0-31641";"The Crystal Fragment? This is an odd one, mate. It's here, but it's also somewhere else. Several other somewheres in fact. Don't think about it too hard. It's bad for your meat-brain."
"115740052-0-31642";"Deshaan, eh? A lot of transliminal dread residue here. Must be the fish. Did you know fish experience thirty-seven different varieties of fear? That's why they always look surprised!"
"115740052-0-31643";"Walk-Brass? Oh, this one's a puzzler, mate! If Anumaril created the Staff of Towers in the First Era, how'd he know about a tower the Dwarves hadn't made yet? Pow! Brain explosion!"
"115740052-0-31644";"So … this book just magically appeared in front of you?"
"115740052-0-31645";"I know what I saw. I was upstairs watching the ceremony, and I turn around for but a moment, and then this book just … just suddenly appears!"
"115740052-0-31646";"Look, the palace is magically sealed by some of the finest mages in Summerset. There's no way someone just teleported a book in here."
"115740052-0-31647";"Maybe it's a cursed relic then? I … I didn't touch it. It's still on the seat upstairs. Maybe we should ask the Sapiarchs to look at it?"
"115740052-0-31648";"These shades will fail you, Z'Maja. The Welkynars' strength shall tear through your shadows!"
"115740052-0-31649";"Z'Maja's link to her shade is crippled. Extinguish the shade and we can end this!"
"115740052-0-31650";"Wait a minute … haven't we been here before? Giant stone maniacs strangling each other to death? Bit silly, eh? First one to crumble into rubble loses, I guess."
"115740052-0-31651";"What's this? The Red Tower fragment? Careful with that one, mate. It's temperamental … and full of spirit-lava. That's the most dangerous kind of lava."
"115740052-0-31652";"Well, that is a prodigious statue. We don't build statues anymore where I come from. They always ended up coming to life, sneezing death-algorithms all over the place …. Trust me, it was a mess."
"115740052-0-31653";"This one's a winner, mate. The White-Gold fragment. The Arch-Mage Anumaril carried it around all the time, you know—slung around his scrawny neck like a cow bell! Classic Ayleid, eh?"
"115740052-0-31654";"Tree Elves and their trees, am I right? They never sing them into anything interesting. Houses, bridges, chairs …. When is someone going to sing a tree into something useful like a singing land-boat?"
"115740052-0-31655";"The Green-Sap Fragment, eh? You know if you'd left it in the dirt long enough it would have grown a new tower. Honest!"
"115740052-0-31656";"Agh! This place is awful! Feels like something's feeding my head through a lumber mill! And that noise! Can you hear that? Let's find this fragment and get out of here!"
"115740052-0-31657";"The Snow Throat Fragment! Congratulations—good for you. Now let's get out of here, eh? My teeth feel like they're going to fall out of my face! Ow. Ow. Ow!"
"115740052-0-31658";"My star-eyed bride of Alinor, lost in storm and spray, my star-eyed bride of Alinor, that cruel fate took away."
"115740052-0-31659";"Another toast! Raise a glass!"
"115740052-0-31660";"To the treasures we lose to the sea."
"115740052-0-31661";"To strangers who brave stormy seas!"
"115740052-0-31662";"To friends and loved ones—new and old."
"115740052-0-31665";"Let's do it again. How often are we going to see a tempest like this in one lifetime?"
"115740052-0-31666";"You always were the romantic."
"115740052-0-31667";"Enough of this!"
"115740052-0-31668";"This way! Quickly! I can't hold this open for long!"
"115740052-0-31669";"Let him go!"
"115740052-0-31670";"There's a time breach here for sure, mate. And it's not petite. I hope you're sure about this. For your sake, I mean."
"115740052-0-31671";"We're close. Give me a shake, eh?"
"115740052-0-31672";"There it is. After you, I guess. Hope you ate something light …."
"115740052-0-31673";"The staff's tearing her apart! Things are about to get very weird, mate!"
"115740052-0-31674";"A Josajeh from an alternate time-line? She doesn't look happy!"
"115740052-0-31675";"The time breach is vulnerable. Now, seal it up tight!"
"115740052-0-31676";"Another angry Josajeh, incoming! And she brought her brother along. Charming."
"115740052-0-31677";"Another breach to seal! Hop to, hero!"
"115740052-0-31678";"The Staff of Towers! At last! Time is mine to control! You will not stand in my way!"
"115740052-0-31679";"Josajeh the evil Psijic tyrant? Drew the short straw on this one, mate. Let's take her down!"
"115740052-0-31680";"That breach—it's the last of them. Seal it!"
"115740052-0-31681";"It's over. Good work! For a meat-brain, I mean."
"115740052-0-31682";"So our adventure is coming to an end, eh? Look, can we … can we talk in private? The Athenaeum maybe? Won't be a moment."
"115740052-0-31684";"You there! I have a—damn it! Why won't this work?"
"115740052-0-31685";"Did you see a golden knight?"
"115740052-0-31686";"I have no idea what that was, and I'm not sure I want to know!"
"115740052-0-31687";"Such a cushion is much too lumpy for our tastes, cat."
"115740052-0-31688";"An intruder in the emperor's sanctum? To me! Slay the invaders!"
"115740052-0-31689";"What is this? Magic? You will pay for summoning me, weaklings!"
"115740052-0-31691";"Sep's maw! He's coming! I'm gone!"
"115740052-0-31692";"This is unbelievable …."
"115740052-0-31693";"I'll meet you in the sinkhole."
"115740052-0-31694";"Wait! Don't start without me!"
"115740052-0-31695";"Nocturnal's minions aren't exactly modest, are they? Not that I'm complaining."
"115740052-0-31696";"Remind me to wear lighter armor the next time we have to climb a mountain."
"115740052-0-31697";"Be ready for anything!"
"115740052-0-31698";"Thank you. Remember, this is my choice. And I choose to die."
"115740052-0-31699";"What did you find there?"
"115740052-0-31700";"Find something?"
"115740052-0-31701";"I'll grant you a reprieve, Orc. This time. Be on your way."
"115740052-0-31702";"You know what? All is forgiven. We both have better things to do than argue I'm sure."
"115740052-0-31703";"Is that the best you can muster? I suppose it is. Very well, now get out of my sight before I change my mind."
"115740052-0-31704";"That wasn't so bad, was it? Now we can both go about our business … I don't suppose you saw which way my horse went?"
"115740052-0-31705";"Oh! My horse! Wonderful! You know, let's just pretend this never happened. Farewell."
"115740052-0-31706";"Ah, there you are. The Ritemaster needs you back in Artaeum immediately."
"115740052-0-31707";"There you are! At least something around here knows its place. I've wasted enough time on you, Orc. Watch yourself."
"115740052-0-31708";"Find him in Ceporah Tower as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-31710";"Forget your travel plans. I'm placing you under arrest for conspiracy."
"115740052-0-31711";"Just get out of here. I hope to never see you again."
"115740052-0-31712";"If you do, I promise it'll be brief."
"115740052-0-31713";"Oh, sweetie, you're making such a big mistake."
"115740052-0-31715";"Dawnbreaker, open the way!"
"115740052-0-31716";"Oh, come on! Stupid Daedric interference!"
"115740052-0-31717";"I'll be ba—"
"115740052-0-31718";"Come and get it."
"115740052-0-31719";"A closed gate won't save them, Leythen."
"115740052-0-31720";"You thought Leythen could stop me? He's only delayed the inevitable."
"115740052-0-31721";"Ignore the creepy voice. We have to keep going."
"115740052-0-31722";"Finally! My true purpose! I will not fail you, Mother!"
"115740052-0-31723";"You can't stop me. I only grow stronger as we bathe this world in darkness!"
"115740052-0-31724";"The tower crystal is almost whole. You're too late, mortal!"
"115740052-0-31725";"Oh, come now. Where's that Silver Dawn valor gone off to?"
"115740052-0-31726";"Make sure this one doesn't go running off, you hear? I'm not done with him yet."
"115740052-0-31727";"I told you to escape with the others."
"115740052-0-31728";"And Narazda told you, she has the right to face her captor as well."
"115740052-0-31729";"Fine! If you want to die playing hero, it's on you."
"115740052-0-31730";"We have to keep moving. The bailey up ahead is—argh!"
"115740052-0-31731";"You're in no state to fight, sweetmeat. Our friends will have to take care of Mylenne."
"115740052-0-31732";"Don't … don't call me sweetmeat."
"115740052-0-31733";"Was Vykosa not told the intruders would be dealt with? Must she handle everything herself?"
"115740052-0-31734";"They shall not intrude much longer, my mistress. I swear it."
"115740052-0-31735";"We cannot continue like this. If you transform now, we'll all be at risk!"
"115740052-0-31736";"You think I don't know that already, cat? Save your concern. I have a plan."
"115740052-0-31737";"So this is your plan? A magical scroll with some miraculous cure?"
"115740052-0-31738";"Yes. That's exactly what this is."
"115740052-0-31739";"… Oh."
"115740052-0-31740";"Perhaps you should think before you speak, cat. Though these ingredients …."
"115740052-0-31741";"Vykosa never wanted this curse. Hircine forced it upon her. Forced this never ending life of anger. Of pain."
"115740052-0-31742";"But make no mistake. She will not become the hunted."
"115740052-0-31743";"We must leave! Adonatus has finally transformed!"
"115740052-0-31744";"No. No, I … I can control it. For now at least."
"115740052-0-31745";"This curse … it does not always lead to misery. You can learn to control it."
"115740052-0-31746";"Like you have? Yes, I know you're one of them. A werewolf."
"115740052-0-31747";"But Narazda is not one of them. She was your ally, your friend. And she still can be."
"115740052-0-31748";"I can't. I swore to protect the innocents of Tamriel, and if that means ending my own life … so be it."
"115740052-0-31749";"Then … here. Take this. You at least deserve a swift end."
"115740052-0-31750";"All is well then, yes? Vykosa is killed, you are cured. A happy ending all around."
"115740052-0-31751";"Narazda, I … I know you're one of them. A werewolf. I knew it the minute I transformed."
"115740052-0-31752";"Oh? Will you kill her, then? Will you kill your ally, just because of what she is?"
"115740052-0-31753";"No. It goes against my beliefs, but … I won't kill you. I can't."
"115740052-0-31754";"But should we meet again, I make no promise to stay my sword."
"115740052-0-31755";"Now that's how to clear a path! I need one of those!"
"115740052-0-31757";"Hircine must have placed the teams in different parts of the forest. Well, hopefully Tarcyr isn't too far off."

"115740052-0-31765";"Is … that you father?"
"115740052-0-31766";"You must leave. Now! Before you too are trapped within these cursed Hunting Grounds."
"115740052-0-31767";"No! I won't leave you to this fate! Not again."
"115740052-0-31768";"Please, I can't—I can't hold it back!"
"115740052-0-31770";"If I cannot dissuade you, Hanu, perhaps I can be of help. This will help you track your quarry."

"115740052-0-31788";"That creature you're chasing looks mighty useful. Want to give your old pal Balorgh a turn with it?"
"115740052-0-31789";"What, team up with you? Just so you can shove a dagger in my back?"
"115740052-0-31790";"Ha! Don't you know? It's hunt or be hunted within the March of Sacrifices! And I've already picked up your scent, lass."

"115740052-0-31800";"Hircine, hear my choice! I choose … to save myself. And father … I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't save you too."
"115740052-0-31801";"Hircine, hear my choice! I choose … to free my father from this loathsome realm."
"115740052-0-31802";"Our people need your wisdom, father. May you find peace among our ancestors."
"115740052-0-31803";"No, Hanu! Don't do this!"
"115740052-0-31804";"Be at peace, Hanu. I will always be proud of you. Always."
"115740052-0-31805";"You would do well not to mock the Huntsman in his own realm, leaf-eater."
"115740052-0-31806";"That so? Well, I'd worry more about yourself and less about your precious Prince, runt."
"115740052-0-31809";"Took a bit of a tumble, huh?"
"115740052-0-31810";"Fetch it all! Hang on, I'll look for a way out."
"115740052-0-31811";"With this, my father's freedom is assured."
"115740052-0-31812";"So kind of you to pay me a visit. Saves me the trouble of hunting you down!"
"115740052-0-31813";"I'm over here! I found-oh! Father, you've returned."
"115740052-0-31814";"Troll's blood, it has to be here somewhere! Keep an eye out."
"115740052-0-31817";"What do you mean? I've brought you the heart!"
"115740052-0-31818";"Yes, but you were not the one to hunt my Hare. Why should I grant you this favor?"
"115740052-0-31819";"You want a hunt? Fine! I'll hunt down the ones who killed that beast in the first place!"
"115740052-0-31820";"Intriguing. Very well. Bring me their hearts, and the boon is yours."
"115740052-0-31823";"Quite the thrilling hunt. My boon is yours, child of Azura. What do you seek?"
"115740052-0-31824";"Freedom for myself and my father. Release us, so we may join our ancestors in death."
"115740052-0-31825";"I hear two requests child, not one. You must choose. A heart for a heart is only fair."
"115740052-0-31826";"Father, I …. I don't know if I can do that."
"115740052-0-31827";"Watch out!"
"115740052-0-31828";"Something's watching us. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-31829";"Quickly, crouch down! We need to stay hidden until we can draw the beast out."
"115740052-0-31834";"Where did he go?"
"115740052-0-31835";"By Kyne!"
"115740052-0-31838";"That doesn't belong to you!"
"115740052-0-31839";"Oh, <<1>>, I told you not to deal with Margus Derius."
"115740052-0-31840";"Over here, friend of Concordia!"
"115740052-0-31841";"Intruders! Protect the nightmare idol!"
"115740052-0-31843";"Ah, fresh meat! More gold for Zadaza when you die!"
"115740052-0-31844";"I'm coming! I'm coming, straight away! Just … just give me a moment."
"115740052-0-31846";"Follow me! If we get separated, I'll find you at the next stop, all right?"
"115740052-0-31847";"Find a different patch of shade, ojel."
"115740052-0-31851";"What's that? Eshraf's journal and another stone? This doesn't look good at all."
"115740052-0-31852";"That proves it! My ancestor and the Ninth Legion did visit this cave! Let's keep looking around."
"115740052-0-31856";"We are gathered here, under the boughs of our tender Hist. To honor the life it gives us."
"115740052-0-31857";"Just as their roots reach out and intertwine in the mud, so too will we become entangled. Bound together to weave a strong foundation."
"115740052-0-31858";"Join me in erecting the spine of procreation! Sow the sap and seed of a new generation!"
"115740052-0-31860";"Eshraf's bag. Was he chased off by one of these salamanders? Keep an eye out."
"115740052-0-31861";"Eshraf? Eshraf! That's odd. He was supposed to be here. Have a look around, would you?"
"115740052-0-31862";"Come and feast, creature! May you break your teeth upon my scales."
"115740052-0-31865";"Dinia? Dinia! Now that's troubling. Eshraf is new, but Dinia's been at this for years. She never misses a hand-off. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-31867";"That's Dinia's sword! She loves that sword. Oh dear, oh dear, this is troubling. Come, let's hurry. I need to speak to someone."
"115740052-0-31869";"I proclaim my gratitude."
"115740052-0-31870";"Let's go over there so we can talk."
"115740052-0-31873";"Looks like Xukas hasn't arrived yet. No Dinia or Eshraf either. Hmm. We should look around."
"115740052-0-31875";"Thank Y'ffre we made it! We brought the tinderwort!"
"115740052-0-31877";"Ziss'vo! Zadaza has been picking at this for—! What did you do, Famia?"
"115740052-0-31878";"Scholarship in action, my friends! Now, let's make some discoveries!"
"115740052-0-31879";"Yes, let's get to it. We're crocodile bait out here."
"115740052-0-31881";"I sent one of our younger members, Eshraf, to the Tsona-Geeva dig-site just outside of town. A surprisingly productive area, despite how close it is."
"115740052-0-31882";"You never have to travel far to find evidence of the ancient Argonian civilization. It won't last forever though. Most of these ruins are already half-sunk into the mud."
"115740052-0-31883";"I won't lie—the swamp's a dangerous place. I've grown to love it, but it can still be terrifying."
"115740052-0-31884";"I need to meet a local Argonian—a Bright-Throat named Xukas. He should be waiting at a hut we use as a gathering place. Maybe we'll find Dinia and Eshraf there, too!"
"115740052-0-31885";"Lots of old, collapsed buildings hereabouts. Murkmire Argonians believe that everything is temporary, you see, so they just let nature take its course. Makes our job a bit more difficult, but still fascinating!"
"115740052-0-31886";"Please, you must understand. We only seek the Remnant to — ah, there you are!"
"115740052-0-31894";"Strange or not, Tsojei and I will kill anything that threatens the Remnant. Anything."
"115740052-0-31895";"The Ree-An-Wo … many strange things stalk the Swallowed Grove, beekos."
"115740052-0-31898";"This way!"
"115740052-0-31899";"A pox on dishonor! Kishi's life matters more than stupid traditions!"
"115740052-0-31900";"Help! I fell into this pit and … oh, Green's mercy! Don't look down. Don't look down."
"115740052-0-31901";"Oh, thank you! I'm climbing up now!"
"115740052-0-31902";"That … was terrifying."
"115740052-0-31903";"Kishi chose to save us. Outsiders will only make things worse."
"115740052-0-31904";"I heard shouting from across the chasm. It sounded like Varo. He needs help! I just … need a moment."
"115740052-0-31910";"Famia? Are you alive?"
"115740052-0-31911";"Zadaza! You avoided the trap?"
"115740052-0-31912";"A rock fell on Zadaza's beautiful tail, but otherwise, she is fine. The others fell into separate rooms."
"115740052-0-31913";"Mara's mercy. Try to find a way around! We'll look for the others down here."
"115740052-0-31914";"Well done! Let's find … oh dear. You don't think there are any snakes in this water, do you?"
"115740052-0-31915";"Some kind of mechanical bridge? Remarkable!"
"115740052-0-31916";"Hmm. I don't see an obvious way to lower it. It must relate to these pulleys somehow."
"115740052-0-31917";"That did it! Well done! At this rate, we'll find the Kajin-Jat Crystal in no time! My friends too!"
"115740052-0-31918";"Oh, what to do, what to do? Wait! Look up there! Flint vine! That could do the trick."
"115740052-0-31919";"Find as much flint vine as you can and wind it up. We'll make a ladder and haul her up!"
"115740052-0-31920";"All right, rest here. But not for too long! The crystal's almost in reach! Let's go help Varo."
"115740052-0-31921";"Stay back, you beasts!"
"115740052-0-31922";"Hold on, Varo! We're on our way! Aim for the abdomen!"
"115740052-0-31923";"That all of them? Good."
"115740052-0-31924";"Jone's bumpy arse, what happened in here?"
"115740052-0-31925";"The crystal is near! Come!"
"115740052-0-31926";"Varo! Don't move! I'll get down there to heal you—somehow."
"115740052-0-31927";"Quick! Quick! Light the candle!"
"115740052-0-31928";"What were you thinking? Bringing this … this … thing here?"
"115740052-0-31929";"Farewell, everyone. Please, do not make me do this again."
"115740052-0-31930";"Well, that was exciting, right?"
"115740052-0-31931";"Are you joking? We nearly died!"
"115740052-0-31932";"Welcome, my friend, to exploring with Famia."
"115740052-0-31933";"Oh, that's hardly fair! Our last expedition was—"
"115740052-0-31934";"Spike pit."
"115740052-0-31935";"Well, yes. But before that—"
"115740052-0-31936";"Angry Naga heart-eaters."
"115740052-0-31937";"Ah, but what about that trip north? That wasn't—"
"115740052-0-31938";"Many, many crocodiles."
"115740052-0-31939";"I have never seen more spiders."
"115740052-0-31940";"Madus lost his hand to one. Remember Madus?"
"115740052-0-31941";"Zadaza mostly remembers his screams."
"115740052-0-31942";"Yes, yes. But need I remind you, we acquired the Kajin-Jat Crystal?"
"115740052-0-31943";"Good for you. As for me? I'm out. This Elf is sticking to woodland adventures from now on."
"115740052-0-31944";"Smart. I'm sitting the next one out, too. Here, Elf. I'll walk you home."
"115740052-0-31945";"Are you certain you're up to it?"
"115740052-0-31946";"Ale's cheap in Lilmoth, and there's not a beast alive that's going to stand between me and a tankard right now."
"115740052-0-31947";"Fair enough. Just take it slow, all right?"
"115740052-0-31948";"A one-legged Imperial and a Wood Elf fresh out of the cradle go wandering into the swamp. What could go wrong?"
"115740052-0-31949";"Stop dragging your tail, Mateem! The hunting party waits for you at the bone-camp. We have a surprise for you!"
"115740052-0-31950";"Famia's crystal is through the next door. Hop down, yes? This one will follow."
"115740052-0-31951";"Dark moons, a trap! Lift those paws, walker! Zadaza will disarm it!"
"115740052-0-31952";"Exhilarating, yes? This one thinks the door is unlocked now. Give it a push."
"115740052-0-31953";"Ha! You see? You aren't the only one who can find side passages!"
"115740052-0-31954";"Note this one's very genuine surprise."
"115740052-0-31955";"The Kajin-Jat Crystal. At last!"
"115740052-0-31956";"Careful, Famia. We have had enough falling and screaming for one day."
"115740052-0-31957";"Sound advice. Should just be a matter of wedging the pressure plate, and … there!"
"115740052-0-31958";"Finally we …. What was that?"
"115740052-0-31959";"Mara's mercy! Run!"
"115740052-0-31960";"Distract it, walker! Zadaza will open the door!"
"115740052-0-31961";"Gone…."
"115740052-0-31962";"By the root! Beeko, I'll light the flame traps! Draw the ooze over them!"
"115740052-0-31963";"You finally arrive! We grow old with waiting."
"115740052-0-31964";"What's happening?"
"115740052-0-31965";"Deadly gas. It fills the xanmeer! Run, now, before you suffocate!"
"115740052-0-31966";"The door is open! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-31967";"Damned leg. I'm right behind you!"
"115740052-0-31968";"A xanmeer! That's the perfect place for Margus to perform his ritual."
"115740052-0-31969";"So this is Norg-Tzel, the forbidden island! We need to find Margus and the Blackguards!"
"115740052-0-31970";"What in Stendarr's name is that?"
"115740052-0-31972";"Do not worry, I have you. Perhaps you will not stop for useless relics next time, eh?"
"115740052-0-31973";"We should enter the xanmeer and stop Margus before he unleashes the curse of Beela-Kaar!"
"115740052-0-31974";"Quick-quick! Margus has started the ritual!"
"115740052-0-31975";"Ah, a bijum-style door-release! Fascinating! A bit of help, please? Just pull that lever there."
"115740052-0-31976";"Wha-? Push! I meant push! Agh!"
"115740052-0-31977";"Ha! Well fought, Mateem! But Uraz is still not here? I do not like this—let us find him."
"115740052-0-31979";"To hunt is to know patience, root-brother. But where is Uraz?"
"115740052-0-31980";"Uraz is not with you? He did not come with us."
"115740052-0-31981";"No matter. We flushed Fat Gixthi, as you asked, Kloxu."
"115740052-0-31983";"Kaoc! I nearly forgot."
"115740052-0-31984";"It is time for your chukka-sei, Mateem. Pierce the heart of Fat Gixthi, and the tribe will see you are full-grown at last."
"115740052-0-31985";"Uraz! He's—"
"115740052-0-31986";"Outsider! Did you do this?"
"115740052-0-31987";"Ah, another soul for our harvest? Delightful."
"115740052-0-31988";"Soldiers! More of these lizards lurk in the swamp nearby, no doubt. Take them. Alive."
"115740052-0-31989";"After all, we'll need guides to their village."
"115740052-0-31991";"You need to stop that ritual and that's a fact!"
"115740052-0-31992";"Disengage the cylinders! That should stop the ritual!"
"115740052-0-31993";"Look-look! Killing those monsters grants access to the ritual cylinders!"
"115740052-0-31994";"Each cylinder you disengage stops another part of the ritual. I think."
"115740052-0-31995";"That did it! One more cylinder and the rest of the energy should dissipate."
"115740052-0-31996";"That chamber, there it is! Deal with the guardian and grab the skull!"
"115740052-0-31997";"Mateem! You live? Come, quickly!"
"115740052-0-31999";"The village bleeds. We pushed the Ayleids back, but our warriors bear new scars."
"115740052-0-32000";"Our sap-speaker calls for aid. Several members of her sacred clutch remain. Find them, Mateem, and bring them here!"
"115740052-0-32001";"Greetings. I am Tree-Minder Pavu of the Bright-Throat tribe."
"115740052-0-32002";"Ha! Oh, that never gets old!"
"115740052-0-32003";"This is everyone? All you could find?"
"115740052-0-32004";"It will have to do. The sap-speaker calls for aid. The four of you must—"
"115740052-0-32005";"They are coming! They are coming!"
"115740052-0-32006";"The Elves! More come, raj-kaal. Hundreds more!"
"115740052-0-32007";"How? We slaughtered them here like hog-fish."
"115740052-0-32008";"That was only the first wave."
"115740052-0-32009";"Kaoc. Fine! Fall back to the Hist. We fight and die in its shadow. Bare your fangs, root-kin!"
"115740052-0-32010";"This is the uxith. The nest where our eggs are cared for."
"115740052-0-32011";"Mateem! Our time runs dry. The sap-speaker calls for you, and you alone. Go!"
"115740052-0-32013";"The egg-tenders take every care to ensure that our offspring are healthy and safe."
"115740052-0-32015";"The Ayleid savages approach, but the Hist provides. A seed of our tribe. A refuge for the souls of our people."
"115740052-0-32016";"Creating this relic is our tribe's last hope. You must find the root's courage and keep the Elves from interfering."
"115740052-0-32017";"Oh … missed it, did you? Fine. I'll find a bucket, I guess. Tell Jee-Lar he'll have this batch as soon as I've separated the sediment."
"115740052-0-32018";"Done like a professional! Enjoy a little tipple now and again, eh? You did great. Tell Jee-Lar he'll have another batch soon."
"115740052-0-32019";"Come, warrior. The trouble tide recedes, but it will crash again soon."
"115740052-0-32020";"This staff. It is the key to the Remnant of Argon, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-32021";"Then it seems our time together has come to an end. This paralytic should keep you here, for a time. Please know I hold you in the highest respect. Farewell."
"115740052-0-32024";"Grieve as you will, but do not think to oppose me, old one. That is a battle you cannot win."
"115740052-0-32025";"Say your words Mewah-Jez and then leave me to my grief."
"115740052-0-32026";"Kishi rejected our laws because of your obsolete ideas, Bhoki. Let this end with your egg-son's death."
"115740052-0-32027";"We are here. No one is harmed, I hope?"
"115740052-0-32028";"We're fine, thank you."
"115740052-0-32029";"Come. No more delays!"
"115740052-0-32030";"Air's a bit thick, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-32031";"So, this is the Dreaming Nest? Yet another dead end."
"115740052-0-32032";"Breathe deep, ojel. We will watch over you, but you walk the path alone."
"115740052-0-32033";"There is more here than you think, Kassandra. The dream-wallow will clear the waters. You will see."
"115740052-0-32034";"All right, we've arrived. What next?"
"115740052-0-32035";"Something in the grove is linked to the Remnant. It is just a matter of finding it, I think."
"115740052-0-32036";"A hunt, then. Good. Whatever speaks to the Remnant here, Tsojei and I will find it."
"115740052-0-32037";"And there she goes …. She is not wrong. We will cover more ground if we split up. If I see anything, I will find you."
"115740052-0-32038";"Hey you! Who are you? What are you doing in there?"
"115740052-0-32039";"Eenu kaal tsogu … hoto greel."
"115740052-0-32040";"What did you say? Something about the Ayleids?"
"115740052-0-32041";"Bhoki! Come out and tell me where Kishi is!"
"115740052-0-32042";"I believe so. Yes, the ancient Barsaebic Ayleid elves. I had no idea they made it this far south."
"115740052-0-32043";"I sigh at the inevitable. Find Kishi while I send Mewah-Jez on a wild guar chase."
"115740052-0-32044";"Then perhaps the Remnant isn't Argonian at all. Perhaps it's an Ayleid artifact. We must learn more."
"115740052-0-32049";"Still nothing about the Remnant? I am well-acquainted with delays, but even my patience has limits."
"115740052-0-32050";"There must be a connection …."
"115740052-0-32051";"What is happening to them, Famia?"
"115740052-0-32052";"I heard a name—Mateem. I … I think our friend is reliving an ancient Argonian's memories!"
"115740052-0-32054";"I see nothing, Famia. Is it a hallucination or an actual vision of the past?"
"115740052-0-32055";"Both, perhaps? I can't …. I can only see the edges. Smoke and whispers. But what our friend is experiencing. It's real enough."
"115740052-0-32056";"But where is the Remnant?"
"115740052-0-32058";"We came here to find the Remnant, Famia. Not to hear mumbling about some hatchling's name-day."
"115740052-0-32059";"I'm sorry, Kassandra—it's very hazy. But there must be something here … something we're meant to see."
"115740052-0-32060";"But there must be something here … some connection to the Remnant."
"115740052-0-32061";"A wamasu hunt hardly seems relevant. What could it possibly have to do with the relic?"
"115740052-0-32062";"I think … I think we're about to find out."
"115740052-0-32063";"These Argonians … they bested the Ayleids?"
"115740052-0-32065";"Yes. It was costly though. I smell smoke and taste blood in my mouth."
"115740052-0-32066";"Perhaps the Remnant helped them?"
"115740052-0-32067";"Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn—they are shaking. What is going on? Is it the Remnant?"
"115740052-0-32068";"Yes! It's very close now. I can almost hear it."
"115740052-0-32069";"Kassandra? Kassandra! What are you—?"
"115740052-0-32071";"New partner, come speak with me!"
"115740052-0-32072";"Get your hands off me! Where is Kassandra?"
"115740052-0-32073";"Well, she left you in my capable hands, sweetheart. You made the mistake of not being useful anymore. But don't worry—I've got a use for you."
"115740052-0-32074";"I'm not going anywhere with you!"
"115740052-0-32075";"I'll be in my shop, preparing the vossa-satl. See you soon, partner!"
"115740052-0-32076";"Oh! It's a chase, then? Good! No fun without a struggle. Get after her, boys! Take her to the sacrificial chamber!"
"115740052-0-32078";"Welcome to your new home, my little friends. Now let's listen to how it sounds."
"115740052-0-32079";"Pure perfection! Take this masterpiece to Captain Jimila with my compliments. That should secure us a deal!"
"115740052-0-32080";"So you made it this far? Impressive."
"115740052-0-32081";"Alas, you have another engagement. Follow me and Famia dies."
"115740052-0-32082";"I grind my fangs. The only death that is certain is yours."
"115740052-0-32083";"Enough theatrics, Jaxsik-Orrn. The Hist allowed me to acquire this staff. Surely you wouldn't fight the will of the roots."
"115740052-0-32084";"You're not supposed to be in here! You really need to leave!"
"115740052-0-32085";"That doesn't belong to you! Let me have it back and please leave at once!"
"115740052-0-32086";"That's an Argonian reliquary! It must have contained one of the cylinders for the ritual!"
"115740052-0-32087";"Another Argonian reliquary! From the looks of it, it was dug up fairly recently."
"115740052-0-32089";"That's a bog-blight! Please be careful-careful, my friend!"
"115740052-0-32090";"Another Argonian reliquary. Margus may have enough cylinders to conduct the ritual now."
"115740052-0-32091";"That's a ritual dagger! Probably the one used by the elders to perform the binding ritual. Now we need to find the altar."
"115740052-0-32092";"More proof that the Ninth Legion and my ancestor explored these caves!"
"115740052-0-32093";"The war-chief sentenced Kishi to death, Bhoki. Your egg-son doesn't even have the good sense to die with honor."
"115740052-0-32094";"I bear my fangs at this insult!"
"115740052-0-32095";"Rage all you want. When Kishi comes for you, we'll slap him in chains!"
"115740052-0-32100";"Wait. Aren't these places usually trapped?"
"115740052-0-32101";"I hope so. What I wouldn't give for a nice warm steam trap right about now."
"115740052-0-32102";"Hmm. Maybe we won't have to."
"115740052-0-32103";"Another note! What happened to the Legion becomes clearer and clearer."
"115740052-0-32108";"Step away, Bright-Throat. This one belongs to the Dead-Water tribe."
"115740052-0-32109";"Wait, please don't. No—no!"
"115740052-0-32111";"Thank you! I'm finished with the Blackguards! You have my word!"
"115740052-0-32112";"The Dead-Water tribe goes to war with the Blackguards, yes. I hunt one of them even now. But we do not need or want your help."
"115740052-0-32113";"Now, go back to your coast-town, ojel. The swamp will eat you if you do not."
"115740052-0-32115";"Brave, ojel … but foolish."
"115740052-0-32116";"I hiss with fury. How did these ojel beasts learn about the Remnant?"
"115740052-0-32117";"We will find out, Jaxsik … provided you do not kill them all."
"115740052-0-32122";"That's the altar the elders used to prepare the rite of binding. I think I can duplicate the ritual, but I need you to do something first."
"115740052-0-32123";"Impressive. You navigate the swamp like a true warrior of the Dead-Water."
"115740052-0-32128";"Come, the Teeth of Sithis won't be safe until we get aid from the tribes."
"115740052-0-32129";"So we're not going back? Give'em a good bash ourselves?"
"115740052-0-32130";"I would rather gather support in Lilmoth. Get some rest, maybe a warm meal."
"115740052-0-32131";"I bet Sithis would want to bash …."
"115740052-0-32132";"Right now, I am strongly considering it."
"115740052-0-32134";"I think that did it! Now climb the stairs and help me complete the ritual!"
"115740052-0-32135";"Malgai wih-jah veeka kai!"
"115740052-0-32136";"More pressing business? Fine. If you return to the hunting grounds, I will find you."
"115740052-0-32137";"The rite of binding is complete! Meet me outside and we can talk!"
"115740052-0-32138";"The outsider dares approach this sacred pavilion?"
"115740052-0-32139";"I mentor the outsider! We ask to walk the Path of the Lily!"
"115740052-0-32140";"Lower your spines, ka-deelith. It is the rare outsider that dares approach the Naga-Kur."
"115740052-0-32149";"Use Hircine's boon for your own freedom, Hanu. You don't deserve this fate."
"115740052-0-32150";"Stay Back! Do not break my concentration! The ritual, it will consume me!"
"115740052-0-32151";"We should leave it to the bog. Surely you agree—oh! Tree-Minder! The ojel! Just as you said!"
"115740052-0-32154";"The glade is not far, I will meet you there as soon as I can."
"115740052-0-32155";"Mara's mercy! The Ayleids that slaughtered the dreaming Hist's tribe built all this? They must have been here for centuries!"
"115740052-0-32156";"Wait—I hear something."
"115740052-0-32157";"Kassandra! What did she do to the staff? Is that the Kajin-Jat Crystal?"
"115740052-0-32158";"Kassandra, wait!"
"115740052-0-32159";"There! The entrance to the Swallowed Grove!"
"115740052-0-32160";"Perhaps rearranging the stones? Ugh … why didn't I pay better attention in Ayleid studies?"
"115740052-0-32161";"Wait! Ha! You did it! You found another vakka crystal! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-32162";"Haxara!"
"115740052-0-32163";"Xuth! More of these creatures among broken eggs. Piled up like refuse."
"115740052-0-32165";"Hold! I will hear what Kishi and the outsider have to say."
"115740052-0-32166";"Blasphemy! Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-32168";"Kassandra! Don't!"
"115740052-0-32169";"You're too late, Famia. I won't let you take this from me!"
"115740052-0-32170";"Wait! Don't touch it!"
"115740052-0-32171";"What—may I ask—do you call that?"
"115740052-0-32172";"Xukas should be along shortly … I hope. Argonians aren't really known for their punctuality."
"115740052-0-32173";"This is about saving our people, Mewah-Jez."
"115740052-0-32174";"Through weakness and trickery? You dishonor our tribe and my egg-brother's memory!"
"115740052-0-32175";"Please. It's all right now. We don't want to hurt you."
"115740052-0-32176";"Pavu will know what to do. She must!"
"115740052-0-32177";"I just need some belladonna berries. They should be further within the keep."
"115740052-0-32179";"No matter. If my novices cannot succeed, your outsider has no chance. No chance at all."
"115740052-0-32183";"Point the arrow I gave you and I'll take care of the rest."
"115740052-0-32188";"Wait! Wait! She's not like the others!"
"115740052-0-32192";"Where is the outsider, Kishi? Did the quicksand swallow them?"
"115740052-0-32193";"Step forward, outsider!"
"115740052-0-32196";"See? She's no danger to anyone. She doesn't have to be like the others."
"115740052-0-32198";"Peace. Here is the one I must hear from."
"115740052-0-32199";"Speak to the others. Return when you have decided."
"115740052-0-32200";"Ugh, that smell. We must be near the Blight Bog Sump. Of course this is where the Veeskhleel would make their home."
"115740052-0-32201";"These were our babies. How could you?"
"115740052-0-32203";"I think we're close. I just feel it."
"115740052-0-32204";"Beela-Kaar, hear my words!"
"115740052-0-32205";"You're here … good. The Hist—it's telling me what we need to do. But we … we have to be quick."
"115740052-0-32206";"Give me your power!"
"115740052-0-32207";"Breathe, friend-Famia. Just tell us what we need to do."
"115740052-0-32208";"Hear my words and reveal your hiding place!"
"115740052-0-32209";"She does not look well. Maybe we should—."
"115740052-0-32210";"No! No … I can do it. You have to touch the Remnant together. All three of you. I promise, you won't … you won't be harmed."
"115740052-0-32219";"Quick-quick! Meet me at the boat and let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-32221";"Quickly now! Ignite the brazier!"
"115740052-0-32222";"CLICK!"
"115740052-0-32223";"Good. The bog-blights will feast on this camp soon enough."
"115740052-0-32224";"Yes! These Blackguards will pay a high price for challenging the Dead-Water tribe!"
"115740052-0-32225";"Well done. Now, travel north. We will raid their main encampment and finish this!"
"115740052-0-32227";"Both, my kaal. What is our story if not the story of the Hist?"
"115740052-0-32228";"Then … is it Etra's story on the grave-stake? Or the Hist's?"
"115740052-0-32230";"Go now, Jaxsik-Orrn—daughter and kaal of the Dead-Water tribe. Guide these souls down the river called Rebirth. Lead them into the waiting arms of the Hist."
"115740052-0-32231";"Xukas of the Bright-Throat tribe, guide these lost souls down the river called Rebirth. Lead them into the waiting arms of the Hist."
"115740052-0-32232";"I can see it! The entrance is just ahead!"
"115740052-0-32233";"Look at it, Iskenaaz! This was Saxhleel. It should rest with the roots of the Hist."
"115740052-0-32234";"That is an aberration! You'll poison the Hist with its corruption!"
"115740052-0-32235";"Of course they have a troll."
"115740052-0-32236";"Let the Tree-Minder decide."
"115740052-0-32237";"That seemed to scare them off for now. Quick, get inside!"
"115740052-0-32238";"A chest! We should—"
"115740052-0-32239";"Leave it, Elf! You'll never get out in time!"
"115740052-0-32240";"Right. You're right! Run!"
"115740052-0-32241";"Your betrothed await you, dear suitors! No need to be shy!"
"115740052-0-32242";"Everyone gets the jitters, but this is ridiculous."
"115740052-0-32243";"Finally, the Vault of Mhuvnak! The Wrathstone must be through there."
"115740052-0-32244";"Tharayya, it's welded shut. There's no way we're breaking through that."
"115740052-0-32245";"Up the ladder! Quickly, please."
"115740052-0-32246";"That construct likely hasn't moved for thousands of years."
"115740052-0-32247";"I've seen far worse. We'll need to salvage some parts though."
"115740052-0-32248";"Wait. Xukas, is that you?"
"115740052-0-32249";"Move it, Famia!"
"115740052-0-32251";"Wake, beeko! Kassandra stole the sap-speaker's staff! We have to follow them!"
"115740052-0-32252";"C'mon! Why are you just standing there? Let's go!"
"115740052-0-32253";"Are you gonna play or what? What's the hold up?"
"115740052-0-32255";"It'll need a new Soul Gem, for one, but I have something to help sniff that out."
"115740052-0-32256";"An acquisition from the Clockwork City. Perfect for finding things in hard to reach places."
"115740052-0-32257";"What is that thing? A brass rat?"
"115740052-0-32258";"Oh, thank you. That madman deserved nothing less. Come on! There's an exit this way!"
"115740052-0-32259";"Come, Depasa. Beel has made her decision."
"115740052-0-32260";"Are we just going to kill everything we come across? I came here to study the Goblins, not slaughter them!"
"115740052-0-32261";"If you want to run on ahead and make a peace offering, be our guest."
"115740052-0-32262";"Let's just take the Soul Gem and go."
"115740052-0-32263";"Hold your horses. Tharayya also said we need to find an equilibrium sphere. Whatever that is."
"115740052-0-32264";"Over here! Look! A body in our drying hut!"
"115740052-0-32265";"He's really dead? He looks to be Veeskhleel. You can never be certain with the Ghost People."
"115740052-0-32268";"Tharayya? We have your parts. I hope they are worth decimating the local Goblin population."
"115740052-0-32269";"The articulators are completely seized up. I can't get it moving again, but I might not have to."
"115740052-0-32270";"Now you mock the Hist? I will cut that dry-tongue out of your lying throat!"
"115740052-0-32271";"Wait! Jaxsik!"
"115740052-0-32272";"Meaning?"
"115740052-0-32274";"Kassandra!"
"115740052-0-32275";"Kaoc! You go save friend-Famia from that crazy Naga. I will try to keep Jaxsik alive."
"115740052-0-32278";"We have your conveyors. It only took murdering every Goblin in this place."
"115740052-0-32280";"It's working! Everyone, away from the door!"
"115740052-0-32281";"Can you not hear it? It … rattles my fangs!"
"115740052-0-32282";"I do, Jaxsik. But you must breathe."
"115740052-0-32283";"Ah, beeko. And friend-Famia? Thank the Hist."
"115740052-0-32284";"Haxara? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-32285";"Come! It is this way!"
"115740052-0-32286";"And there she goes again."
"115740052-0-32287";"Is she going to be all right?"
"115740052-0-32288";"Yes, friend-Famia. This is the will of the Hist. You will see, I think."
"115740052-0-32289";"Did you find something? You all seem quite … motivated."
"115740052-0-32290";"I'll try to find the cave on my own."
"115740052-0-32291";"Remarkable! This is the village you saw in your dream-wallow, right?"
"115740052-0-32292";"Yes. What is left of it, anyway."
"115740052-0-32293";"Well, I'm no arborist, but there's definitely something wrong with that Hist tree. It can't be dead, can it?"
"115740052-0-32294";"No. But it struggles for wakefulness. It gives everything to the Remnant."
"115740052-0-32295";"Well, it really is something …."
"115740052-0-32296";"Yes, it is."
"115740052-0-32297";"Famia! We haven't the time. If we are this close to the Remnant, others may be as well. Come."
"115740052-0-32298";"I'm sorry Xukas, no, I hear nothing. Can you describe—?"
"115740052-0-32299";"By the Hist … my head. Do any of you hear that?"
"115740052-0-32300";"But Kassandra, if he—"
"115740052-0-32301";"Enough. Let's proceed."
"115740052-0-32302";"I see you were at least able to perform the Vastei-Sei successfully. Surprising, to say the least."
"115740052-0-32304";"Crouch down, beeko. Look for bent stalks, torn leaves, or muddy prints. Should be easy. Jaxsik-Orrn rarely sneaks around danger—she goes through it, always."
"115740052-0-32305";"I see their approach. You make me wait too long, Xukas."
"115740052-0-32306";"So it's a fight? Hmm. I fight best from the shadows, beeko. I leave the direct approach to you."
"115740052-0-32307";"Why the cutting words, Paraxeeh? All I did, I did according to your teachings."
"115740052-0-32308";"Did I teach you to beg an ojel to perform your duties? You should have collected those tablets, Vozei! How could you not see that?"
"115740052-0-32309";"Was … was it you who stole the tablets, Paraxeeh? Why? Why would you desecrate the Xinchei-Konu in such a way?"
"115740052-0-32310";"If you had your eyes towards your people, and not only towards your books, I would have no need to take such actions. This was a lesson, Vozei. A lesson you failed."
"115740052-0-32311";"Huh? Did you hear something?"
"115740052-0-32312";"What is that?"
"115740052-0-32313";"What are you two talking about?"
"115740052-0-32314";"But … but I was able to perform the Vastei-Sei!"
"115740052-0-32315";"I hear something … is that creaking? Please say it's not skeletons!"
"115740052-0-32316";"Skeletons! Mara's mercy. I'm no mage, but these do seem different, don't they? They're not feral. It's like they're guarding something."
"115740052-0-32319";"By the Eight, look at this masonry! I'll bet this predates the surface xanmeers by a century or more! Fascinating."
"115740052-0-32320";"Geel wazeithi … huptal? Sorry, these engravings are just impossible to read. Something about a Dreaming Nest? Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-32321";"Oh! There's a skele—! Giant bone … thing! Dear, oh dear, oh dear!"
"115740052-0-32322";"Well. That was, you know, nightmarish."
"115740052-0-32323";"Hah! I'd like to see the likes of Neramo do that!"
"115740052-0-32324";"It seems the Dwemer didn't leave the Wrathstone unguarded. Not surprising. I trust you can handle it."
"115740052-0-32325";"Mateem! Over here!"
"115740052-0-32326";"It worked! The Xinchei-Konu changed the weather!"
"115740052-0-32327";"Norg-vos. Warning stones. Our old-kin built them to keep the Saxhleel away, but we will use them to guide us instead. Fear is for our enemies. They will know it soon."
"115740052-0-32328";"Huh? That's strange. I thought the effect would last much longer."
"115740052-0-32329";"Only for a moment. One of such weak will can never truly be a catalyst of change. Hmm. I suppose another lesson will now be in order …."
"115740052-0-32330";"The dream-wallow showed you this place, didn't it? A place for proving strength. We will have many chances to show our own, I think."
"115740052-0-32331";"Paraxeeh? Wait! Don't tell me you're going to steal the tablets again!"
"115740052-0-32332";"The Blackguards nest in Xul-Thuxis? Are they mad?"
"115740052-0-32333";"Mad or not, Tsojei and I will hack them dead."
"115740052-0-32334";"Finally, the Wrathstone. Not what I expected."
"115740052-0-32335";"That room up ahead—it stinks of Kassandra's dryskin perfume. She has been here."
"115740052-0-32336";"Quiet. I hear something."
"115740052-0-32337";"Kassandra cannot be far. She hopes to delay us by putting friend-Famia in danger, I think. Xuth. Come. Let's find another way into the deeper ruins."
"115740052-0-32338";"An outsider? Here? Ojel, help me get loose from these bonds."
"115740052-0-32339";"Eat mud, dryskin!"
"115740052-0-32340";"Is someone there? Please, root-kin! I need help!"
"115740052-0-32341";"The door is locked. The key, it should be in the speaker's lodge!"
"115740052-0-32342";"Mateem. Thank you. I must, I must find the sap-speaker and Raj-Kaal Druxith."
"115740052-0-32344";"Thank you, Mateem. Gather your strength. We fight again soon."
"115740052-0-32346";"Kasa-Jeen …. I … I am sorry."
"115740052-0-32347";"Run, you mud-legs! Zadaza is done with this place!"
"115740052-0-32348";"So, these dryskins are good for something after all."
"115740052-0-32349";"I hate this swamp! I'm never coming back!"
"115740052-0-32351";"Ah, Keenam. Mimme. We have a guest very interested in our customs. Please, show them the utmost courtesy."
"115740052-0-32352";"Jaxsik. Approach carefully."
"115740052-0-32353";"It's you! Thank Y'ffre. Please, get us out of here!"
"115740052-0-32354";"If I can channel enough energy through the tonal emitter on it's arm, it should reduce the vault door to twisted slag, but I'll need fresh shock conveyors to manage it."
"115740052-0-32356";"This xanmeer feels different, doesn't it? Brighter. Aside from all the oozes, of course."
"115740052-0-32357";"Miregaunts! Oh dear. They roam around some of the older ruins—protectors of some sort, I think. Be careful!"
"115740052-0-32358";"Ah! See that breach in the wall? I smell a shortcut!"
"115740052-0-32359";"Tell Bhoki that you saved me. Tell him that I will find a way to save our tribe."
"115740052-0-32361";"An Ayleid gate? How long did those invaders stay in Murkmire? Never mind. It must need a welkynd stone to function. Let's have a look around."
"115740052-0-32362";"Hmm. A bit sticky, but it should do the trick. Let's place it in the sconce near the gate. That should open the way!"
"115740052-0-32363";"It worked! I guess we should see where it leads."
"115740052-0-32364";"How beautiful! And to think no one has seen this place in more than a hundred seasons!"
"115740052-0-32365";"Ugh—don't breathe it in! My nose burns from here."
"115740052-0-32366";"Hey! The rat's moving again. I guess we keep following?"
"115740052-0-32367";"Damn, more Goblins. You go ahead, we'll catch up when it's clear."
"115740052-0-32368";"The ancient Argonians certainly liked their stairs. Goodness."
"115740052-0-32370";"This an equa-whatever sphere, rat? Looks round enough to—and there it goes again. Let's get these parts back to Tharayya."
"115740052-0-32371";"Pee-yew. A terrible odor. It sticks in my throat."
"115740052-0-32372";"I tried… I tried to save them. It all went wrong."
"115740052-0-32376";"Hold up, I think the rat's onto something."
"115740052-0-32377";"Vakka reelsh vastei buseek xal!"
"115740052-0-32378";"Hop to, dock toads! And watch your step, this pier is made from wicker and prayers."
"115740052-0-32380";"Oof. I think I pulled something."
"115740052-0-32381";"I told you to stretch beforehand, you oaf. And don't go thinking you can go convince me to rub your aching back when we're done."
"115740052-0-32383";"How are we supposed to find anything in all this mess?"
"115740052-0-32384";"By the Egg … are we inside the Remnant of Argon?"
"115740052-0-32385";"Hmm. Yes. A dream, sealed in amber."
"115740052-0-32386";"I did not think it would be so … green. So peaceful."
"115740052-0-32387";"The peace of the grave. This is a place out of season. Sunless. Unchanging. A place for hiding, not for living. We cannot stay here."
"115740052-0-32388";"Ha. Spoken like a true Dead-Water kaal. Let us look around."
"115740052-0-32390";"Didn't I say so, Kishi? There's something special about this outsider."
"115740052-0-32391";"Trust the rat, Goblin-hugger … there! Let's get these back to Tharayya."
"115740052-0-32392";"Beeko! Over here! I found something."
"115740052-0-32393";"Delaw ruheeva wuxa vastei bok tar-sakka!"
"115740052-0-32394";"Deep sap! Can you believe it?"
"115740052-0-32396";"Do not be a limp fish. You did right coming to me. I sense there are more coils to this snake than a mere property dispute."
"115740052-0-32397";"My spines droop to see what this dispute has turned into. What a dishonor to poor Keema-Ru."
"115740052-0-32398";"I'm sorry. I just wanted to take the pain away."
"115740052-0-32399";"Thank you both for agreeing to this negotiation."
"115740052-0-32400";"Of course! Far be it from me to deny the wisdom of a Shadowscale."
"115740052-0-32401";"Oh, please. Let's just get this over with."
"115740052-0-32402";"Before we begin negotiations, I want the two of you to shake hands, amicably. To show your good intentions in coming here."
"115740052-0-32403";"What … what happened? What did you do?"
"115740052-0-32404";"What was asked of me. I resolved their dispute. I entrust the farm to you, Chuxu. You'd do best to not disappoint me."
"115740052-0-32405";"Thank you for giving me this honor, beeko. I promise, I will guide the tribe safely to the next life."
"115740052-0-32406";"Xukas …."
"115740052-0-32407";"Ha. You do not club me and drag me away? Do not fear for me, Jaxsik. I guide this tribe, but another will gather beneath the branches. You should lead them."
"115740052-0-32408";"I will. And when we meet again, you will see a new village—strong and proud."
"115740052-0-32409";"It could not hope for a better leader."
"115740052-0-32410";"Thank you, Rootmender. I swear on the sap, nothing will keep this tribe from reaching the next life."
"115740052-0-32411";"Friend-Jaxsik, I …."
"115740052-0-32412";"My laughing-spine quivers. Xukas has no words? Now, I have seen everything. I … I will miss you. My friend."
"115740052-0-32413";"Finally, she admits it. Too late …."
"115740052-0-32414";"I shake my head. You know I will return some day. For now, care for the tree, and guide the Saxhleel who gather there."
"115740052-0-32415";"As for you—sword-kin. Fighting at your side has been the greatest honor a kaal could ask for. Thank you, and farewell."
"115740052-0-32416";"Mewah-Jez, prepare the Path. The outsider will undergo the same rite as our novices."
"115740052-0-32417";"War-chief, no! You cannot allow Kishi to disrespect our cherished customs!"
"115740052-0-32418";"Do as I command, war-teacher! I want to see how the ojel fares."
"115740052-0-32419";"This will work, Bhoki. You'll see."
"115740052-0-32420";"Careful, friend-outsider! I'm stretching the rules of the Path by pulling you out of the quicksand."
"115740052-0-32421";"So far, so good. Now let me tell you about the next section of the Path."
"115740052-0-32422";"You finished the second trial. Let's find a safe spot to speak."
"115740052-0-32423";"This spot is good. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-32424";"And that is how we walk the Path of the Lily!"
"115740052-0-32425";"Let's return to the village and present the sacred lily to the war-chief. You did well, friend-outsider!"
"115740052-0-32427";"Mara's mercy! Help! Anyone! Please!"
"115740052-0-32428";"You? I've been waiting for this a long time. Come on!"
"115740052-0-32429";"The outsider approaches now, bearing the sacred lily. You haven't seen one in a while, have you Mewah-Jez?"
"115740052-0-32430";"That is not possible!"
"115740052-0-32431";"My friend-outsider will explain. I'm going to take Bhoki home now."
"115740052-0-32432";"There is your gate, Xukas. To the Snake-Means-Death City, Xul-Thuxis, and the temple beyond. We challenge the Void here, sword-kin."
"115740052-0-32433";"It is not so scary if you squint your eyes. Just really narrow your …. No, it is still terrifying."
"115740052-0-32434";"I need to consider what happened here, Raj-Kaal."
"115740052-0-32435";"Your methods were as successful as ever, egg-sire. The outsider claimed the sacred lily."
"115740052-0-32436";"Of course, it wouldn't be that easy! Get ready!"
"115740052-0-32437";"Gods! How much longer are you going to wait?"
"115740052-0-32438";"You've returned! Now it is time to destroy that which has been created. Quickly, smash the monument with your hammer!"
"115740052-0-32439";"All right, my dears! Places! Grrgllle!"
"115740052-0-32440";"And one, and two … hrrgll!"
"115740052-0-32441";"Oh! Over here—no—there we go!"
"115740052-0-32442";"Finale! Big flourish!"
"115740052-0-32443";"Did the mud-lizards send you to find me? You're meddling in things that don't concern you!"
"115740052-0-32444";"I have no quarrel with you. Don't make yourself my enemy. Turn around."
"115740052-0-32445";"I tried to offer you the same mercy you gave me! You should have taken it."
"115740052-0-32446";"Axdred? Did you find it? I need it for mother. She has to be here for this."
"115740052-0-32447";"They're coming for me now. To send me to mother, but I won't go. I'm not finished yet!"
"115740052-0-32448";"You won't take this from me! You won't take anything else from me!"
"115740052-0-32450";"Hardly looks Dwarven to me."
"115740052-0-32451";"That's because it isn't. I've never seen anything quite like it."
"115740052-0-32452";"I'm going to hang your hide over Lilmoth!"
"115740052-0-32453";"Why do you care for those savages? They're barely more than beasts!"
"115740052-0-32454";"Julitta …."
"115740052-0-32455";"You killed my mother! You killed my father!"
"115740052-0-32456";"They don't deserve your help! They don't deserve to live!"
"115740052-0-32457";"Mother! I'm sorry …!"
"115740052-0-32458";"If the cold doesn't do it, try something else. They're lizards. They can't possibly just adapt to everything."
"115740052-0-32459";"That's the thing. I don't think they are just lizards. I don't know what they are. Their physiology is… I don't know how they are even alive."
"115740052-0-32460";"Keep trying. There must be some way to break them."
"115740052-0-32461";"They'll tell me their secrets one way or another."
"115740052-0-32462";"Souls do not just vanish, Houtern! Find them, or I will find someone else who can."
"115740052-0-32463";"My lord, the Hist's magicks are unlike any we've encountered before. The souls are pulled to a focus of some kind. Without finding the source …."
"115740052-0-32464";"The Remnant … it always comes back to the Remnant. Continue your research. I have much to consider."
"115740052-0-32465";"After all this time, this is all we could manage … a lifeless vault of gateways, availing us nothing!"
"115740052-0-32466";"My lord, we have carved a golden path to the very frontiers of magical praxis. This nexus is austere, yes, but—."
"115740052-0-32467";"You mean to convince me to abandon my search, don't you? The power of the Hist—the power of the Remnant—dwarfs your golden path! I will claim the tree's power, no matter the cost!"
"115740052-0-32468";"My lord? You wished to show me something?"
"115740052-0-32469";"Cast your eyes across this vast expanse. Tell me, what do you see?"
"115740052-0-32470";"Gates, my lord. A realm of doors and passages."
"115740052-0-32471";"Yes. A sea of azure gates—none of which lead to the Hist. Perhaps we use the wrong kind of passage. Find one of these beasts' sun-crystals. We have work to do."
"115740052-0-32472";"We found a suitable stone, my lord. The arcane properties are unlike any I've seen before."
"115740052-0-32473";"Yes. We should have been researching them from the beginning. The Light of Magnus given form. Remarkable."
"115740052-0-32474";"Integrating this new stone into our existing gates …. The process will take time."
"115740052-0-32475";"Time no longer matters to me, Houtern. I've made preparations. Even if it takes an eternity, I will discover the Remnant's secrets."
"115740052-0-32476";"Kishi … we must have words."
"115740052-0-32477";"I will not apologize for my actions, Mewah-Jez."
"115740052-0-32478";"I seek none. You have done what I could not. Your novice survived and walked the Path."
"115740052-0-32479";"What are you saying, Mewah-Jez?"
"115740052-0-32480";"I am saying that you have my support. Teach … and I will learn."
"115740052-0-32481";"Then together, we will make the Dead-Water even stronger than before."
"115740052-0-32482";"You are well-travelled, yes? Let us exchange pleasantries and word from the road."
"115740052-0-32483";"I am only thinking of the good of the tribe!"
"115740052-0-32488";"Remember, root-brothers and root-sisters. This is not a ritual of death, but of change."
"115740052-0-32489";"We do not mourn this loss, but celebrate the souls' reunion with the Hist, and all who have passed before."
"115740052-0-32490";"We bid them safe journey with song, and dance, and frills of joy."
"115740052-0-32491";"Let them know, as they pass on, that we are the Root-Whisper tribe! And in this place they will always find a home."
"115740052-0-32496";"Look! Those columns in the water feature the same symbols as the counterweights. A tutan-wei pully-puzzle! I've never seen one in person!"
"115740052-0-32498";"Hear me, sword-brothers and root-sisters. This is not a ritual of death, but of change."
"115740052-0-32499";"We do not mourn these souls' passing. Like our swords and bows, they find new glory in the place beyond. Beyond the treeline of what living eyes can see."
"115740052-0-32500";"We bid them safe journey with song, and dance, and joyful war-cries."
"115740052-0-32501";"Let them know, as they pass on, that we are the Root-Whisper tribe! And in this place they will always find a home."
"115740052-0-32504";"Wait! It's their chieftain! I might be able to arrange a truce, maybe even a trade for the stone!"
"115740052-0-32505";"Or you can just kill him. Nothing deranged about that."
"115740052-0-32506";"<Flattering Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-32507";"<Furious Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-32508";"No, no, no, no! Help!"
"115740052-0-32511";"I'm sorry—I'm sorry! Excuse me!"
"115740052-0-32512";"Oh my, that was … detailed. <Pleading Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-32513";"<Contemptuous Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-32514";"<Mocking Goblin laughter.>"
"115740052-0-32515";"Soriel! Let's get this in the saddle bags. Carefully."
"115740052-0-32516";"It seems like part of it is missing."
"115740052-0-32517";"Yes, it does … and I aim to find out why."
"115740052-0-32518";"I hear your words, Kishi, and my spines swell with pride."
"115740052-0-32519";"Earning the trust of Goblins is easier than earning the trust of their durzogs. I almost got within shouting distance this time. I just need—"
"115740052-0-32520";"Ranja would call it fleeing with one's tail between one's legs."
"115740052-0-32521";"The competition is here. You've squandered our head start, Landal."
"115740052-0-32522";"Do you smell something unpleasant, Kaska?"
"115740052-0-32523";"Wamasu poo smells better and I speak true. Will it leave our village soon?"
"115740052-0-32524";"Ah! It's alive! Don't let it get me …! Oh."
"115740052-0-32525";"You're heartless!"
"115740052-0-32527";"More food for my pets? Very well!"
"115740052-0-32528";"Damn… you…"
"115740052-0-32530";"Search with your toes, Stibbons! Your toes!"
"115740052-0-32531";"No, it is not possible. You do not even possess a renewal charm."
"115740052-0-32532";"My manservant will be along with one momentarily."
"115740052-0-32533";"Ah, look. Here they come now."
"115740052-0-32534";"Even so, no outsider has ever participated in our sacred rite."
"115740052-0-32535";"You talk to her. Maybe she'll understand your less-refined use of the language."
"115740052-0-32536";"That looks like a hummerwing hive. Could you give it a little kick? Gently!"
"115740052-0-32537";"Well, that's bigger than I expected."
"115740052-0-32538";"Argh! One bite, I said! One bite!"
"115740052-0-32539";"Ah, you located a snake den."
"115740052-0-32540";"Now… carefully … like milking a very small, elongated goat .…"
"115740052-0-32541";"Here goes nothing. Bottoms up."
"115740052-0-32542";"Sorry about the mess there. Got kicked over during the commotion earlier."
"115740052-0-32543";"Stibbons! You smell like a swamp. Stand over there this instant."
"115740052-0-32544";"As you wish, m'lady."
"115740052-0-32545";"My manservant did as you asked. Will you allow him to observe your ritual?"
"115740052-0-32546";"If you insist. Come, dryskin. Join us in the lodge."
"115740052-0-32547";"The ux starts now. Breathe deep the arousing fumes. Take it all in. Let your aligned essences guide you. When you feel totally filled, relax your cloaca and let it all out …."
"115740052-0-32548";"Ah … I don't think I have a cloaca …."
"115740052-0-32549";"Don't have a—oh no! You must exit the lodge right now, dryskin!"
"115740052-0-32550";"That was … most peculiar …."
"115740052-0-32551";"Stibbons! Oh, not again."
"115740052-0-32552";"Stibbons, go with our friend and align your bodily fluids. I want you to attend the renewal rite in my place!"
"115740052-0-32553";"I, m'lady? Er … why me?"
"115740052-0-32554";"So that you can tell me all about it and I can write it in my book! Now get going!"
"115740052-0-32555";"Halt, ojel! Why do you approach the Tree that Crumbles Stone?"
"115740052-0-32556";"Snake venom. If I must drink the vile stuff, we'll need to find a den. Let's split up and look around."
"115740052-0-32557";"Help! I say help! Stibbons has gotten himself stuck fast!"
"115740052-0-32558";"The Remnant of Argon. The Hist wants me to take it."
"115740052-0-32559";"Let's go. We need to ask Xukas and Jaxsik what to do next."
"115740052-0-32560";"Much thanks! That wasn't as pleasant as you might expect."
"115740052-0-32561";"Get going, Stibbons. And do try to redeem yourself this time."
"115740052-0-32562";"Right away, m'lady. Just let me … catch my breath …."
"115740052-0-32563";"Lady Laurent demands restitution you … you … jackanapes!"
"115740052-0-32564";"Jackanapes? You must have me confused with an Argonian of another tribe."
"115740052-0-32565";"Swift travels, ojel."
"115740052-0-32566";"Wait! Wait! Wait! What happened to reaching a peaceful resolution?"
"115740052-0-32567";"Sorry, Landal. We tried it your way. I'm not freezing to death out here over Goblin diplomacy."
"115740052-0-32568";"You there. Come have a word by our fire."
"115740052-0-32570";"Hear me, Sithis! Your altar has gone unbloodied far too long. Grant me your power, and I will carve your name into all the flesh of Murkmire!"
"115740052-0-32571";"Ojel. This way."
"115740052-0-32572";"Starblossoms. Do you see?"
"115740052-0-32573";"I cannot leave yet!"
"115740052-0-32574";"Very well. You and Famia go ahead. Whiptail and I will follow in a moment."
"115740052-0-32575";"Starblossoms and deep sap. For the dream-wallow. I feel pain in my throat when I say it, but Famia was right."
"115740052-0-32576";"Why thank you, Jaxsik-Orrn! The inscription on this door … the Dreaming Nest is just through here. I'm certain."
"115740052-0-32577";"Then that is where we go."
"115740052-0-32578";"Yes, by all means—bare your fangs! I wouldn't want this to be too easy."
"115740052-0-32579";"Haxara …! Kaoc! That's the second time today."
"115740052-0-32580";"Have you forgotten the laws of the hunt so soon? Prey is supposed to run."
"115740052-0-32581";"The trail leads here."
"115740052-0-32582";"The trail is headed this way."
"115740052-0-32583";"Iskenaaz, assist our visitor however you can."
"115740052-0-32585";"Can you do this another time, Iskenaaz? We're already behind."
"115740052-0-32587";"I don't deserve them!"
"115740052-0-32588";"These were supposed to be our children!"
"115740052-0-32589";"Ranja has let your toy rat through this door. No need to thank her."
"115740052-0-32590";"Was it listening to us? I didn't know it could do that. In any case it must have detected something. Check it out."
"115740052-0-32591";"Come, Haxara, we have ignored your pain for too long. Now it is our pain, and we will overcome it together."
"115740052-0-32592";"Come, my love. We aren't home yet … but we will be soon."
"115740052-0-32593";"Enough, Landal. You had your chance."
"115740052-0-32594";"I will be at their beck and call, Tree-Minder! This way, beek-ojel."
"115740052-0-32595";"Sun's blessings, friend-Famia. I hope you did not wait too long."
"115740052-0-32597";"Perhaps a tour of the egg-tender's quarters is of interest? It is just up the way."
"115740052-0-32598";"Our visit should not arouse suspicion, we host many guests, but your discretion would be appreciated."
"115740052-0-32600";"See there? The door awakens! Try opening it now, Zadaza."
"115740052-0-32601";"Is it working?"
"115740052-0-32602";"Oh, and watch out for venomous flora. The plants in Murkmire bite!"
"115740052-0-32603";"Hold your weapons! I yield."
"115740052-0-32604";"You have won, challengers. I yield."
"115740052-0-32605";"I found you. I finally found you. Please. Let us help you."
"115740052-0-32607";"The naheesh elders never speak of this place … not even to me. Stay watchful, beeko."
"115740052-0-32608";"I hear something. The chimes … they sing without wind. Just ahead. Kaoc, I hate this."
"115740052-0-32609";"Good work, beeko! Let us get back to Bright-Throat Village."
"115740052-0-32610";"Fine, you heathens! I yield."
"115740052-0-32611";"A beast, nesting in the Wither-Vault? Soiling the chime? My rage-quill is engorged!"
"115740052-0-32612";"Be calm, old Shuvu. No one wants to see that."
"115740052-0-32613";"Perfect! Now center yourself in the glade and focus the Remnant's mystery on the prayer stone."
"115740052-0-32614";"We seek your guidance and ask the blessing of your song, sap-mother, bough-father. Please, hear our petition and speak the Remnant's truth."
"115740052-0-32615";"I … I hear nothing. A tangle of whispers—nothing more."
"115740052-0-32616";"That can't be. Wait. I hear it, Shuvu … I hear it! The Hist sings the Remnant's truth!"
"115740052-0-32617";"Truly? Ha! Ah, little Xukas, I knew you had a chime-maker's heart. Come, tell us what you hear!"
"115740052-0-32618";"Ah, hello!"
"115740052-0-32619";"Kassandra said you'd be here. There's news."
"115740052-0-32620";"Xuth! How many of you must I kill?"
"115740052-0-32621";"It's no use. Pockets have been picked clean."
"115740052-0-32622";"Nothing is ever that simple."
"115740052-0-32623";"Good, you're here."
"115740052-0-32624";"His throat was cut. Simple bandages weren't enough to staunch the bleeding, it seems."
"115740052-0-32625";"What have you found? Show them to me, if you would."
"115740052-0-32626";"We should look at your child, Haxara. You as well. The healing hut will be quiet."
"115740052-0-32627";"Give her a minute more. She's overwhelmed. It's all right, dear."
"115740052-0-32628";"I grind my fangs. This is a desecration!"
"115740052-0-32629";"Over here, ojel!"
"115740052-0-32630";"Haxara, you have done the unthinkable. Whether you intended to or not, you have harmed our Hist and our tribe. For your crimes, I banish you from our land. Go in peace, but never return."
"115740052-0-32631";"Just give her space. She's afraid. We'll be gone soon enough."
"115740052-0-32632";"Help! Anyone! Cannot … breathe!"
"115740052-0-32634";"Three against one? Honorless greels!"
"115740052-0-32635";"My thanks, Mateem. Now, I must find Raj-Kaal Druxith."
"115740052-0-32636";"I hear … voices. Do you not hear them?"
"115740052-0-32637";"And with that, I'll light the final signal totem."
"115740052-0-32639";"So, this is the adventurer you mentioned, Famia? Excellent."
"115740052-0-32640";"Blackguards. Hmm. Unwelcome news, isn't it, Whiptail?"
"115740052-0-32641";"I'll handle it. Give me two hours."
"115740052-0-32642";"No, no. Our new friend has the situation well in hand."
"115740052-0-32644";"If the Hist wills it so, flat-tooth. But I shall not hold my breath over such a thing."
"115740052-0-32645";"Finally! Took you long enough."
"115740052-0-32646";"Upon reflection, I have decided to … keep your stories as they have been told to me. If I am to spread Argonian tales, it is best to sing the words in an Argonian manner."
"115740052-0-32647";"Very well, my lady. I'll get you back to Lilmoth … after you've paid me half of what you promised."
"115740052-0-32648";"Very well, dryskin. You may … adjust our stories. I see now that your spineless audience will never swallow the truth of our words."
"115740052-0-32649";"Very good. I hope you never put anyone else through this torture. Who pays good gold to wander through the muck?"
"115740052-0-32654";"The game is lost if the ball passes through the highest hoop. Unless the moons are both more than halfway full."
"115740052-0-32655";"I just don't get it! What kind of game has this many rules? How do you remember them all?"
"115740052-0-32656";"Don't find me. I'll find you."
"115740052-0-32657";"If it isn't my favorite vagabond. Keeping busy?"
"115740052-0-32658";"I've got my part to do, so I'll leave you to do yours. Be seeing you."
"115740052-0-32659";"All right, so hitting the wall earns you one point. The lower hoop earns you three points, and the upper hoop ends the game. Isn't that right?"
"115740052-0-32660";"The only way to score a point is to hit the ball through a hoop—."
"115740052-0-32661";"Finally, he gets it! Very well then. We will explain the other rules as we play. Perhaps that will be easier."
"115740052-0-32662";"Wrong! If you cannot even learn the basics of hip and tail ball, you cannot play the sport. Now leave us be."
"115740052-0-32663";"Did you see the new chime hanging within the Glade of Chimes? I do not know it."
"115740052-0-32664";"The Remnant Chime? I never knew we had such a thing."
"115740052-0-32665";"Then perhaps I shall ask Shuvu. He must know more about it."
"115740052-0-32666";"Chime-Maker Shuvu spoke of it. It is called the Remnant Chime."
"115740052-0-32667";"I'm afraid I know little more than you do on such matters."
"115740052-0-32668";"The Blackguards scatter like cowering insects. May the swamp take those who escape our many spears."
"115740052-0-32669";"Jaxsik-Orrn fought them, alongside a Bright-Throat and outsider. Only three against so many, yet they triumphed over all."
"115740052-0-32670";"How did this come to be? No war party was called to fight."
"115740052-0-32671";"She was aided by a Bright-Throat and outsider? By the Hist, I know not who is less likely to strike against such foes."
"115740052-0-32691";"It's unusually quiet at Cyrodilic Collections. They all off on an expedition?"
"115740052-0-32692";"What? Why, she'll never last a day with those villains. Do you think Kassandra knows?"
"115740052-0-32693";"Kassandra … working with the Blackguards? Divines have mercy."
"115740052-0-32694";"If they are, it's not going well. A cousin of mine was mapping the northern swamp. Says he saw Famia captured by the Blackguards."
"115740052-0-32695";"That's the thing. My cousin told me that Kassandra was with them too, only she was … giving out orders. Almost like she was leading the lot."
"115740052-0-32696";"Have you seen Haxara's child, in the healer's hut?"
"115740052-0-32697";"She is like a ghost. Like her body is here, but she is elsewhere."
"115740052-0-32698";"I think it's beyond our healers to make the poor creature whole."
"115740052-0-32699";"Probably … but the Hist will share its wisdom if it desires her to change."
"115740052-0-32700";"I have seen Haxara in Lilmoth seeking coin for passage inland. It is true tragedy to see her reduced to fetching drinks and washing laundry."
"115740052-0-32701";"I would choose begging. The empty thing she calls her child is deserving of charity."
"115740052-0-32702";"What she will have to endure is beyond my imagining."
"115740052-0-32703";"Punishments aren't meant to be easy. It's merciful, I think, compared to what she did."
"115740052-0-32704";"I'm glad Jee-Lar was finally able to send more supplies. I'll admit, I was starting to get a little worried there."
"115740052-0-32705";"Yeah, haven't you heard? He started recruiting. Even convinced … oh, what's their name?"
"115740052-0-32706";"You mean the one who got the Golden Skull?"
"115740052-0-32720";"It seems that Cyrodilic Collections just found something worthwhile. Their Khajiit lockpicker just bought a round of drinks at the tavern."
"115740052-0-32721";"Tsona-Geeva? Didn't that place just collapse? They're lucky they made it out alive."
"115740052-0-32722";"I heard. Seems they finally found their way into the Tsona-Geeva xanmeer. Lucky them."
"115740052-0-32723";"Jee-Lar has certainly been busy. These shipments keep getting larger!"
"115740052-0-32724";"And stranger. A lizard? Why would we need another lizard when the swamps are full of them?"
"115740052-0-32725";"A new hire saved them all from certain death, or so I hear. It's about time Kassandra got someone competent on her payroll."
"115740052-0-32726";"I know what you mean. Yesterday we received some sludge that stinks worse than a corpse. Whatever is that for?"
"115740052-0-32727";"I just hope Jee-Lar knows what he's doing."
"115740052-0-32732";"Yeah, that one! Oh, I just wish I could remember their name …."
"115740052-0-32733";"All right, this is getting out of hand. Today's shipment is huge!"
"115740052-0-32734";"We'll need to hire more dock workers to unload it all."
"115740052-0-32735";"Fires burn in the swamp, and the Blackguards are in disarray. Who could have performed such a feat?"
"115740052-0-32736";"Xuth! Only three against so many? I did not know that Xukas had such strength."
"115740052-0-32737";"The way he tells it, the traveler did most of the fighting. Even Jaxsik-Orrn was impressed."
"115740052-0-32742";"Be careful when leaving town these days. I hear the Dead-Water are abducting anyone they find."
"115740052-0-32743";"Really? Couldn't have happened to a nicer group of people."
"115740052-0-32744";"Dead-Water? That's not what I heard. It's the Blackguards. And their caravan just got raided to free the people they took."
"115740052-0-32745";"Even so — I wouldn't want to be on the Blackguards' bad side."
"115740052-0-32746";"Come all those faithfull to the efforts of the Ebonheart Pact! Join up today."
"115740052-0-32747";"Staying moist, beeko?"
"115740052-0-32748";"We've lingered long enough. I'll be seeing you soon, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-32749";"How nice of you to see me off."
"115740052-0-32750";"Don't forget to empty your pockets now and again."
"115740052-0-32751";"If a storm doesn't hit first. You never can tell when the weather will take a turn for the worst in these swamps."
"115740052-0-32752";"Luckily for us, Jee-Lar got a prophetess on the payroll. There shouldn't be any storms this week."
"115740052-0-32753";"Now to pack enough phlegmwine and grubs to last the trip."
"115740052-0-32754";"At last, the Root-Whisper Village has awakened. For far too long has it slumbered."
"115740052-0-32755";"Yes, but it is such a shame we had to lose Jaxsik-Orrn. It was an honorable thing, giving herself to the Hist in order to guide so many lost souls."
"115740052-0-32756";"Still, we have Xukas to guide us. Under his leadership, our village will prosper through peace and trade."
"115740052-0-32757";"Yes. By his guidance, Root-Whisper will one day prosper under a blessed sun."
"115740052-0-32758";"At last, the Root-Whisper Village has awakened. For far too long has it slumbered."
"115740052-0-32759";"Yes, but it is such a shame we had to lose Xukas. It was an honorable thing, giving himself over to the Hist in order to guide so many lost souls."
"115740052-0-32760";"Still, we have Jaxsik-Orrn to guide us. Under her leadership, our village will prosper through strength and force."
"115740052-0-32761";"Yes. By her guidance, Root-Whisper will one day prosper under a blessed sun."
"115740052-0-32766";"Have you heard that Cyrodilic Collections managed to obtain the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar?"
"115740052-0-32767";"What? Really? Why, that artifact has been lost for centuries!"
"115740052-0-32768";"Precisely. Makes me wonder who could possibly accomplish such a task."
"115740052-0-32769";"Someone of note, that's for sure."
"115740052-0-32770";"Hmm. And so the lesson is wasted."
"115740052-0-32771";"The path to the Remnant bends like an ox-bow. Let's find this chime."
"115740052-0-32772";"Leaving the Glade always puts rocks in my sandals. Sad, you know? One day the two of us should share some phlegmwine there and just listen."
"115740052-0-32774";"The swamp grows thick here. A far cry from Lilmoth's mud-puddles, I think."
"115740052-0-32775";"Oh, Leviathan Pizzle grows across this glade. A very powerful herb, beeko. Remind me to pick some later!"
"115740052-0-32776";"I cannot imagine the Bright-Throats ever holding territory here. Very little wind, hollow seeds, and poor fishing. Take away our wind, seeds, and fish, and we grow very sour!"
"115740052-0-32777";"There it is—just up ahead. This place dries my scales."
"115740052-0-32778";"No good thing comes from stone. Let's make this quick."
"115740052-0-32779";"I fear we will find more than the chime inside this vault. Be careful."
"115740052-0-32780";"Well, would you look at that. How kind of this traveler to light our fire!"
"115740052-0-32781";"Embrace your fear, Deetum-Jah. Only then can you see past it."
"115740052-0-32782";"Fine. Given our impending deaths, that shouldn't be too hard to do."
"115740052-0-32783";"I just heard. Someone found Danlai dead on the road."
"115740052-0-32784";"No. Poor Danlai! What got him? Crocodile?"
"115740052-0-32785";"Worse. Someone skinned him alive. Left him filleted like a river trout."
"115740052-0-32786";"What? Who would do that to a simple fishmonger?"
"115740052-0-32787";"Who would do that to any Saxhleel? Even the Ghost People wouldn't!"
"115740052-0-32788";"You—you don't think the killer has a grievance against anglers?"
"115740052-0-32789";"Best not to seek fresher waters for a while then. Just in case."
"115740052-0-32790";"Trust in the Hist! Here they come!"
"115740052-0-32791";"Did you hear? About Danlai's killer?"
"115740052-0-32792";"I heard whispers of a Skin Taker. Is what they are saying true?"
"115740052-0-32793";"Yes. At least three now. The Root-Heralds are still reaching out to neighboring tribes."
"115740052-0-32794";"This sounds like the work of a monster. Some Oblivion-sent fiend."
"115740052-0-32795";"Or some sort of swamp-tree monster."
"115740052-0-32796";"Why would such a beast skin its prey?"
"115740052-0-32797";"Vengeance for peeling off tree bark?"
"115740052-0-32798";"Their leader approaches. Keep him away! The ritual is nearly complete!"
"115740052-0-32800";"Enough! I will pry your secrets free personally!"
"115740052-0-32801";"You cannot win, lizard! Submit!"
"115740052-0-32802";"You haven't stopped me …."
"115740052-0-32803";"I may have chosen the wrong bait."
"115740052-0-32804";"You are not the only one."
"115740052-0-32805";"What's so funny? You have fared no better."
"115740052-0-32806";"You didn't hear? The Skin Taker was caught by a bigger fish."
"115740052-0-32807";"Truly? What was it? Daedra? Tree-Beast?"
"115740052-0-32808";"Some Blackguard slaver spared by the Root-Heralds. A waste of mercy."
"115740052-0-32809";"Blackguards! Is there no depth they are not willing to sink to? One day they will drown!"
"115740052-0-32810";"You are quiet today."
"115740052-0-32811";"My thoughts are muddied by news of the Skin Taker's death."
"115740052-0-32812";"I should think those thoughts would be clear. What's not to celebrate about such news?"
"115740052-0-32813";"It was a young woman, you know? Too young to carry so much hate and malice."
"115740052-0-32814";"She was a Blackgaurd, yes? They are born hateful and cruel."
"115740052-0-32815";"No, vengeance is a wheel of wrongs we push together."
"115740052-0-32816";"Hmm. The Dead-Water already outfit for war. I hope this bloodshed doesn't spill into Lilmoth …."
"115740052-0-32817";"Your eyes are as lovely as muddy puddles, found deep within the swamp."
"115740052-0-32818";"Your voice is more beautiful than the croaking of a vossa-satl."
"115740052-0-32819";"Together we would hatch many eggs, so large and robust that all would be in awe."
"115740052-0-32820";"Become my uxith-beeko, Wawul. The bonding ceremony awaits."
"115740052-0-32821";"Oh, Guleesh! Such things you say."
"115740052-0-32822";"Oh, stop it. You're going to make me blush."
"115740052-0-32823";"Are you … saying what I think you are?"
"115740052-0-32824";"Of course. Oh Guleesh, you've made me so happy."
"115740052-0-32825";"Though the Saxhleel generally choose to live in tribes based around a Hist tree, Lilmoth is a merchant town with no true leadership."
"115740052-0-32826";"That is why there are so many travelers in this town. Deeper in the swamp, the tribes tend to be more isolated and hostile to outsiders."
"115740052-0-32827";"Professor, can you tell us what an uxith-beeko is? I've overheard some Argonians referring to it, but I'm not familiar with the term."
"115740052-0-32828";"Oh, well. It's a term used for a … ritual partner that performs, ah …."
"115740052-0-32829";"In the dryskin tongue, you would say ""nest-friend."" I am sure you can draw the meaning of such words. You are scholars, after all."
"115740052-0-32830";"Hoo. Stronger than I remember. Must've lost more blood than I thought!"
"115740052-0-32831";"You think vampires drink? Don't say it! I'm not talking about blood!"
"115740052-0-32832";"I can't see why they would."
"115740052-0-32833";"Don't drink. No wonder they're trying to end the world! Miserable rotten life, that is! I'd bash my brains out if—whuh … this bar always wobble so much?"
"115740052-0-32834";"Haxara. You wanted to be here when they hatched so badly. Now's your chance."
"115740052-0-32835";"I'm so close! Can't you see that? You can have your children!"
"115740052-0-32836";"You never did. Kill them!"
"115740052-0-32837";"Tree-Minder, if you saw what I saw, there would be no question."
"115740052-0-32838";"If you hadn't run, you might understand!"
"115740052-0-32839";"Did you not hear? It was Xukas who fought them, alongside Jaxsik-Orrn and a newly arrived traveler."
"115740052-0-32840";"What, this is my fault? You're the one who lost the map!"
"115740052-0-32841";"Don't turn this around on me!"
"115740052-0-32842";"Look, we'll have plenty of time to argue after completing our assignment."
"115740052-0-32843";"Don't snap at me! I'm not the one who started it."
"115740052-0-32844";"Can we head back to camp yet? I'm dead tired."
"115740052-0-32845";"You'll be dead dead if we don't find those artifacts."
"115740052-0-32846";"Bickering again? Come on you two, have a little decency."
"115740052-0-32847";"I'd rather have a little sleep."
"115740052-0-32848";"What, so now it's my fault we lost the artifact?"
"115740052-0-32849";"You're the one who put it with the food!"
"115740052-0-32850";"What could you possibly have been thinking?"
"115740052-0-32851";"We only had the one bag! Besides, how could I have known a hackwing would eat it?"
"115740052-0-32852";"Come, my love. Let's go home."
"115740052-0-32853";"What? Why you little!"
"115740052-0-32854";"I do not like the dry air in the shallows."
"115740052-0-32855";"Yes, too thin and ripe with ojel."
"115740052-0-32856";"All the easier to smell what we are after though."
"115740052-0-32857";"Yes, yes, makes the work quick, at least."
"115740052-0-32858";"How could you lose it? Did the Hollow outwit you?"
"115740052-0-32859";"I do not see you faring better."
"115740052-0-32860";"Enough. Most likely it was eaten by beast or mud."
"115740052-0-32861";"We will need a better explanation than that if we return empty handed."
"115740052-0-32862";"Hmph, why is it we are taking only the hollow eggs? Why not take all we can carry?"
"115740052-0-32863";"So as not to raise suspicion, fool."
"115740052-0-32864";"The hollow eggs are malleable as well. They produce the best results."
"115740052-0-32865";"Fair points … but it seems wasteful to leave their untapped potential for Bright-Throats and Moss-Skins to squander."
"115740052-0-32866";"Let's be quick then. I wish to be somewhere dark and dank."
"115740052-0-32867";"Come on, Drooler. Let's go find Shiralas."
"115740052-0-32872";"I'm about to head up to the new Root-Whisper Village. Want to come along?"
"115740052-0-32873";"You're heading where? Look, I've been in Murkmire for years, and I ain't never heard of a Root-Whisper Village."
"115740052-0-32874";"You haven't heard yet? Some newcomer awakened a Hist Tree! It was slumbering all this time, deep in the swamp."
"115740052-0-32875";"Could it be? Someone finally awakened a dreaming Hist? By the Green, I can hardly believe it!"
"115740052-0-32876";"Do you feel that? Something … something is wrong."
"115740052-0-32877";"What could it be? I have never felt such power before. It leaves me barely able to think."
"115740052-0-32878";"I sense it too. The roots of our Hist feel restless. I can almost feel them rumbling beneath our feet."
"115740052-0-32879";"Let us remain calm. Whatever must pass, will pass. For now, we can only wait."
"115740052-0-32880";"By the Hist, can you believe it? An entirely new tribe, so close to our own borders!"
"115740052-0-32881";"Yes, it is most exciting. They called themselves Root-Whisper. A fitting name."
"115740052-0-32882";"We must journey there! Show our respects, offer our aid."
"115740052-0-32883";"Of course, my beloved. But first, let us give them some time to collect themselves. Starting a new village is no small task."
"115740052-0-32884";"My spines are on edge, but no foe is near. Why is this so?"
"115740052-0-32885";"My teeth gnash! If there is nothing to strike, how can we defeat it?"
"115740052-0-32886";"It is not a foe, egg-brother. It is something much more. I feel it deep within."
"115740052-0-32887";"We cannot. Though it pains me, this is not our battle to fight."
"115740052-0-32888";"Must you leave us, egg-sister? Always, we have fought together. Why now must you go?"
"115740052-0-32889";"A new Hist calls to me. I cannot defy its will. I must help a new tribe prosper."
"115740052-0-32890";"My tears swell, but … so too do I understand. Still, I will miss you."
"115740052-0-32891";"And I you, egg-brother. Never will I forget your strength by my side."
"115740052-0-32901";"Did you see the bonding ritual? The uxith-beekos looked like good matches this season. I'd hoped to be picked myself, but … perhaps another time!"
"115740052-0-32902";"Hm? Oh, yes! Very lovely. There was a particular suitor that caught your eye?"
"115740052-0-32903";"Have you seen Milzus?"
"115740052-0-32904";"Not since she found poor skinless Danlai. Her spines were stiff as dry reeds."
"115740052-0-32905";"She knows the Skin Taker is dead now, surely."
"115740052-0-32906";"You don't forget something like that so easily."
"115740052-0-32907";"There are so many new faces coming through Lilmoth since Cyrodilic Collections arrived. I hope more stop by the village."
"115740052-0-32908";"You always want to meet new people. What's wrong with us? I just hope they bring some new games to Murkmire."
"115740052-0-32909";"Ooh, yes! And we could teach them Teeba-Hatsei. Do you think they'd want to learn?"
"115740052-0-32910";"How will they play Hip and Tail Ball without a tail?"
"115740052-0-32911";"Maybe we let them use their feet? We should find some visitors to try it out!"
"115740052-0-32912";"Oh, haha … something like that."
"115740052-0-32913";"Listen to that, Haseta. Frogs. They make music with frogs!"
"115740052-0-32914";"Well, if you can call that music."
"115740052-0-32915";"It's different though, isn't it? A sound found only in Murkmire!"
"115740052-0-32916";"Hmm. A sound that should stay in Murkmire, if you ask me."
"115740052-0-32917";"You think so? Perhaps if we got one for the tavern …."
"115740052-0-32918";"No, absolutely not. Who would we even get to ship such an instrument?"
"115740052-0-32919";"Did you hear? Captain Jimila is now exporting vossa-satls!"
"115740052-0-32920";"Truly? She's a crafty trader. Perhaps there's worth to the instrument after all …."
"115740052-0-32921";"Just as I suspected! We simply must get one for the tavern."
"115740052-0-32922";"Delmasir, think about this. Frogs? What do you even feed them?"
"115740052-0-32923";"Just imagine it, Haseta. ""A Sundas stroll in Murkmire. Hear the true music of the swamp!"""
"115740052-0-32924";"All right, all right. I'll get the negotiations started."
"115740052-0-32925";"Do not be alarmed, you will be all right. The grub-mash I gave you should alleviate your dryness."
"115740052-0-32926";"Grub-mash! Ugh—is that what that awful taste is. Ulp—Auri-El have mercy."
"115740052-0-32927";"They are a bit like under-ripe tadpole, but their guts are very wet. Keep some in your pocket if you feel faint again."
"115740052-0-32928";"Bluh—stop. Please! Just stop helping."
"115740052-0-32929";"They're making more poison! Be careful! I'll try to mix an antidote!"
"115740052-0-32931";"He's oozing poison! I'll try to clear the air!"
"115740052-0-32933";"Rest? Recuperate? You're mentoring Lady Twilight herself, soon to be the greatest thief in our generation! There's no time for such things."
"115740052-0-32934";"Or we could lay low. Get some rest, recuperate from our near death experience …."
"115740052-0-32935";"Not even a day with you, and I'm already looking back at my days of capture with longing."
"115740052-0-32936";"Now that we've put Blackrose behind us, it's time to finally complete our mission!"
"115740052-0-32937";"Seeks! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-32938";"Of course! Lady Twilight is always here to save the day!"
"115740052-0-32939";"Ah, Erilthel. So nice of you to finally show yourself."
"115740052-0-32940";"I'll keep watch of Haxara until you return. Please be quick!"
"115740052-0-32942";"So it's come to this? I have to kill you myself? Fine!"
"115740052-0-32943";"What is she—? Watch out!"
"115740052-0-32944";"Are you so desperate to keep me from what I want? What I deserve? Damn you!"
"115740052-0-32945";"She can't have gotten far. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-32946";"Look for an active magicka condenser to tap into. It'll be coursing with power. Hard to miss."
"115740052-0-32947";"It didn't melt to slag? Perfect. Follow the energy flow to any active conveyors and discharge the energy."
"115740052-0-32948";"It worked! Repeat the process on any remaining conveyors and we may overload the defenses."
"115740052-0-32949";"That's it! Something's happening. Get out of there, quick!"
"115740052-0-32950";"The bones of a leviathan. An ill omen to be sure—but for whom?"
"115740052-0-32951";"The bones of the ancient dead rise in protest. Whiptail should pay for disturbing this sacred place."
"115740052-0-32952";"Gulvo vakka-lo Kajin-Jat!"
"115740052-0-32953";"It is, Famia. And I would be lost without it! Farewell."
"115740052-0-32954";"Get up! I made you to be more than this!"
"115740052-0-32955";"Your notes said abandoned, as in no one left alive inside."
"115740052-0-32956";"Due diligence, Quintus. It's why I'm alive an you're—hold on, we have company."
"115740052-0-32957";"Take it to the Imperial Census."
"115740052-0-32958";"We should really get moving, Haxara. I can escort you to Lilmoth."
"115740052-0-32959";"Good. Now prove you aren't another disappointment!"
"115740052-0-32960";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-32961";"Hail again, friend! How goes your frog collecting?"
"115740052-0-32962";"All right. It is finished … Sithis, use me as you will."
"115740052-0-32963";"I … I am warmed to the core by the presence of the Dread Father. Can you not hear my heart throb as I swell with his power of creation?"
"115740052-0-32964";"I carried Ruxol to prepare me to bear his legend! For the Black-Tongues I will sow a thousand generations!"
"115740052-0-32965";"<Noisy gulping.>"
"115740052-0-32966";"I will not … be consumed! I will not!"
"115740052-0-32967";"I will meet you at the uxith. The nesting beds."
"115740052-0-32968";"Something defiles our stores. It hunts us."
"115740052-0-32969";"We purge it. As is her will."
"115740052-0-32971";"It consumes us. We need a plan."
"115740052-0-32973";"The mural… it bears the image of hunting party. What does it say to you?"
"115740052-0-32975";"When I want to be wrong, I'll ask for your opinion."
"115740052-0-32976";"I think … I think I know why I'm here. I'm supposed to bring the Remnant back."
"115740052-0-32977";"Interlopers! You will not disrupt my plans. Not at this final hour!"
"115740052-0-32980";"You're doing it wrong."
"115740052-0-32981";"Some of the vault's defenses are still active. Disabling them is too complex for skeevatons on their own."
"115740052-0-32982";"Something isn't right, the defenses are still active. Of course, it wouldn't be that easy."
"115740052-0-32983";"Sep's fangs! I've never seen anything like it. Hold it off, I'll think of something!"
"115740052-0-32985";"You always did have a flair for stating the obvious."
"115740052-0-32987";"A shrine? Why would the Imperials build this?"
"115740052-0-32988";"Who cares? What matters is they found the Wrathstone. It's right there for the taking."
"115740052-0-32990";"Submit to her will. It is the only way."
"115740052-0-32991";"Your friends are skilled explorers, Tharayya. They've discovered a woman more frigid than you. I didn't think it possible."
"115740052-0-32992";"Trap free, for once."
"115740052-0-32993";"That was never meant for impure hands! It will not leave my care!"
"115740052-0-32994";"Euraxians? Here? We expected an attack from the east and south, but they've somehow encircled the town!"
"115740052-0-32995";"Oh, this spring attaches to the widget with the hook, then put the fire salt in the tiny little nook …."
"115740052-0-32996";"Get out, servant of the Usurper Queen, before this one claws your eyes."
"115740052-0-32997";"You can count us out of whatever you're planning next. I've had enough of this madness."
"115740052-0-32999";"I should be the one to search for Father and Uncle, not these outsiders."
"115740052-0-33000";"Thank you, adept. I'll go and break the sad news to Tsazii."
"115740052-0-33001";"This one will say the words to guide Hursh to the Sands Behind the Stars."
"115740052-0-33009";"An Imperial garrison housed in a Khajiiti estate. My half-sister spared no expense, I see."
"115740052-0-33010";"To arm a trap, just twiddle this bit like so and …."
"115740052-0-33011";"Oh, dear."
"115740052-0-33012";"I'm fine, I'm fine. I twiddled when I should have tweaked. Just a wee bit scorched is all."
"115740052-0-33014";"Oh, my, it's happening again."
"115740052-0-33016";"Well, that's an evil-looking Orc. A necromancer, I do believe."
"115740052-0-33020";"""Khunzar-ri said, ""Not by myself, foul demon. I shall gather a Kra'Jun—a company of heroes …."""
"115740052-0-33021";"""… starting with the Altmer, Nurarion the Perfect, who communes among the buried roots of the Ayleid worms."" These are the words, and the words are true."
"115740052-0-33022";"Over here, five-claw. Let us talk."
"115740052-0-33025";"I see you found the report. Now we can continue our conversation without being separated by those inconvenient bars."
"115740052-0-33026";"Ah, the distinctive smell of Daedric sorcery. It's as atrocious as it is pervasive."
"115740052-0-33028";"The ancient Khajiiti really want us to work to uncover the triangulant."
"115740052-0-33029";"Pretty ingenious for a bunch of ancient cats. Why don't you see what's in the chest before we head to the Baandari Trading Post."
"115740052-0-33030";"Riverhold belongs to Queen Euraxia, cats!"
"115740052-0-33031";"I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this."
"115740052-0-33032";"Every death is just a new recruit for Euraxia's army!"
"115740052-0-33033";"Come along. I can't maintain this portal indefinitely."
"115740052-0-33035";"Ah, there you are. And I see you've captured Prefect Calo. I presume he surrendered without a fight?"
"115740052-0-33037";"An alliance? Interesting. Comrades would be helpful in the battles to come."
"115740052-0-33038";"Riverhold's blessed Moon Pillars. They can cleanse the necromantic curse."
"115740052-0-33039";"This one must be at peace to memorize the inscription."
"115740052-0-33042";"Deal with the undead while this one activates the Pillar of the Summer Moon."
"115740052-0-33043";"""Khunzar-ri said, ""Because two shall become three, annoying demon …."""
"115740052-0-33044";"""… As soon as this one rescues Flinthild Demon-Hunter from the Ayleid lair of creeping ebony plants."" These are the words, and the words are true."
"115740052-0-33046";"It's happening again! I see … I see … a Dragon!"
"115740052-0-33048";"Cadwell? Cadwell! What was that about a Dragon?"
"115740052-0-33050";"The Khajiit moon-singers went to a great deal of effort to separate and hide their clues, but I feel like we're getting closer."
"115740052-0-33051";"Ah, another prism puzzle. At least the ancient Khajiiti were consistent."
"115740052-0-33052";"Examine that stone plaque, will you? Any clue will be helpful."
"115740052-0-33053";"Adequately done. Now collect the triangulant and let's be on our way."
"115740052-0-33057";"""Then Khunzar-ri turned to the rest of his Kra'Jun. ""One more we need, a Khajiiti queen of renown. Anequina Sharp-Tongue …"""
"115740052-0-33058";"""… who loves to bask in the glow of the Big Moon when she reflects and thinks deep thoughts."" These are the words and the words are true."
"115740052-0-33065";"I find it fitting that the final triangulant awaits us in a Khajiiti ruin."
"115740052-0-33066";"With luck, we'll gather the last triangulant and be done with ancient ruins."
"115740052-0-33068";"I hardly doubted you. Now grab the final triangulant and let's return to my camp in Grahtwood."
"115740052-0-33070";"Dark Moons! Dragons!"
"115740052-0-33073";"That door … not even all of Zamarak's strength and training can budge a magical barrier. Maybe the pedestal?"
"115740052-0-33074";"We can't fight Dragons!"
"115740052-0-33075";"Khamira, consider your next words very carefully …."
"115740052-0-33077";"The pedestal maintains the magical barrier, but Zamarak does not know how."
"115740052-0-33078";"Find the Dragonguard or his blood won't be the only thing that stains my blade this day!"
"115740052-0-33079";"The assassins! That came from the south. We must hurry, five-claw!"
"115740052-0-33081";"You can't hide from us forever, Dragonguard!"
"115740052-0-33082";"You couldn't find an Alfiq in Alabaster, Euraxian dolt!"
"115740052-0-33083";"That was the Dragonguard! We're running out of time!"
"115740052-0-33084";"Once I select a target, it always dies."
"115740052-0-33085";"I trained to fight Dragons. This isn't going to end the way you expect."
"115740052-0-33086";"Once you know where to look, the location becomes perfectly obvious. Come, let's talk."
"115740052-0-33088";"The Halls of Colossus? Arrogant Imperial! Without my assistance, you will never survive that place."
"115740052-0-33089";"Away with you, cat! It falls upon me to end this accursed war."
"115740052-0-33090";"So you can declare yourself emperor? I think not! I will accompany you to find and destroy the weapon."
"115740052-0-33091";"Emperor has never been my ambition. Join us, if you want. Just don't get in my way."
"115740052-0-33096";"The barrier has fallen! Let us see what awaits within."
"115740052-0-33098";"The archives were extremely helpful, once I found the appropriate documents."
"115740052-0-33099";"Our Moon-Singers and Moon-Priests have always paid particular attention to detail. What did you learn?"
"115740052-0-33100";"That Dragonguard didn't survive, but he gave us the Anequina Dragonhorn."
"115740052-0-33101";"Tharn found documents regarding an ancient agreement with the Dragonguard. They apparently provided a weapon to use against the Dragons."
"115740052-0-33103";"Hrrm. So this alliance I reluctantly agreed to has borne fruit?"
"115740052-0-33107";"This one thinks the Goblins aren't interested in what you have to say. We have that in common."
"115740052-0-33108";"I agree with the princess. The time has come to remove my half-sister from the throne."
"115740052-0-33109";"It's on to something. After it."
"115740052-0-33110";"Now that I have revealed my true heritage, we need to act quickly, Lord Speaker."
"115740052-0-33112";"You can follow it through this door. The lock is broken. Thank the Goblins for saving Ranja the trouble."
"115740052-0-33113";"Queen, Tharn. I have not been a princess in a very long time."
"115740052-0-33114";"I stand corrected. Queen Khamira. You said you had a way to get us into the palace, Lord Speaker?"
"115740052-0-33116";"Wait! Vazbi saw someone!"
"115740052-0-33117";"Why do they run? We do not mean them any harm!"
"115740052-0-33118";"There they go! Is that the same one as before?"
"115740052-0-33119";"So quick! Come, we have to keep up!"
"115740052-0-33123";"Vazbi! Beloved child. Finally, you have come home at last."
"115740052-0-33125";"Beloved what? I don't— We only want to restore the water."
"115740052-0-33126";"Water? No, no, no! You come for answers, child. Answers from ashes!"
"115740052-0-33128";"Take her to our camp at the Baan Dar Gate. Kill the other and cleanse them in flame. The scouring fire will claim S'rendarr's Cradle soon enough!"
"115740052-0-33129";"Welcome to Aneshi's humble shrine to Khunzar-ri. Here, we remember the tales of the hero of ancient Elsweyr."
"115740052-0-33134";"Vazbi! You are unharmed, yes?"
"115740052-0-33135";"Silhu-jo!"
"115740052-0-33136";"No! My daughter is no longer yours to corrupt, adept!"
"115740052-0-33137";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-33140";"No!"
"115740052-0-33141";"Let's split up. We can corner him!"
"115740052-0-33142";"Dry? Ziss'vo! Wait. What is this?"
"115740052-0-33143";"Curious …."
"115740052-0-33144";"How are our companions, Lara-Tan?"
"115740052-0-33145";"All is well, egg-brother. Your antidote has helped them immensely."
"115740052-0-33147";"Wait. Silhu-jo must speak to you."
"115740052-0-33148";"Ah, you found it! We should examine the gate at the top of the ramp."
"115740052-0-33149";"Caught you! Ha! Vazbi is a quick study, yes? Let's examine this new gate."
"115740052-0-33150";"Be careful in this place, walker. The ghosts could emerge at any moment!"
"115740052-0-33151";"Quickly! Over here!"
"115740052-0-33152";"Hold, varlet! Don't you dare attach that foot to my ankle!"
"115740052-0-33153";"This is Cadwell's longest episode yet. Perhaps I can—"
"115740052-0-33155";"These sick-scarred you see—we call them the Stricken. After the Knahaten Flu ravaged their bodies, the people of Elsweyr cast them out."
"115740052-0-33157";"They came to S'rendarr's Cradle once. For healing. But the king's vizier would have put our adeptorium to the torch if he knew we harbored the sick."
"115740052-0-33158";"You should know the reason they hate us. It is my fault. They wish to burn our home because I cast them into Baan Dar's Litter, to die."
"115740052-0-33159";"Five-claw! I decided to join you. Aneshi deserves to hear that I still live in my own words."
"115740052-0-33161";"Jode above, old Aneshi can hardly believe his eyes! Princess Khamira!"
"115740052-0-33162";"It is truly me, castellan, but I am Queen Khamira now. We will throw the usurper from my father's throne."
"115740052-0-33163";"We stayed close to the castle. Zaima, my brave and beloved wife, she passed information to the militia until the vile Euraxians caught her."
"115740052-0-33164";"After that, Aneshi came here to restore this ancient shrine. This one will help you as best he can, my queen."
"115740052-0-33165";"I will visit with Aneshi, five-claw. Recover the master key and meet me in Rimmen."
"115740052-0-33166";"Open and dry, as expected. Hopefully, we'll find the blockage at the second gate."
"115740052-0-33167";"We should be able to watch Queen Khamira destroy the far platform from over here."
"115740052-0-33170";"She did it! Now let's meet the others at the sewer entrance."
"115740052-0-33175";"Everyone, unsheathe your claws."
"115740052-0-33176";"These ruins are not empty. Your friends have come this way. I can smell them."
"115740052-0-33177";"Euraxia's soldiers are not my friends, cat. I will not allow them to seize the weapon."
"115740052-0-33178";"So you say, but will you really oppose your sister?"
"115740052-0-33179";"Half-sister. And I oppose anyone who adds to the woes of the Empire."
"115740052-0-33180";"Wait! This is the royal crypt, but it has been disturbed!"
"115740052-0-33181";"It's the necromancer, Zumog Phoom!"
"115740052-0-33182";"They locked us in!"
"115740052-0-33183";"Queen Euraxia will be delighted to hear that we have guests!"
"115740052-0-33184";"If you'll excuse us, we have another member of your party to deal with."
"115740052-0-33189";"Head through the far chamber. I'll see where this door leads. Try not to wind up like those Imperials."
"115740052-0-33190";"Tharn, old sport, they ripped it out of me …."
"115740052-0-33193";"I haven't been able to sleep all week. Please, can't you do something?"
"115740052-0-33195";"Help! They're going to destroy me!"
"115740052-0-33196";"Destroy you? No. We're simply correcting a mistake of nature."
"115740052-0-33197";"Of course. I'll have the town guards investigate tonight."
"115740052-0-33198";"Well, that wasn't pleasant. You go on. I'll be along in a snap."
"115740052-0-33199";"Abnur Tharn and the Wrathstone, just as Queen Euraxia predicted."
"115740052-0-33200";"Thank you, Magnate Feina-Darak."
"115740052-0-33201";"Queen? I see my demented half-sister is still full of herself."
"115740052-0-33202";"My queen sends her love. And this poison gas."
"115740052-0-33203";"To me, before the gas takes you!"
"115740052-0-33204";"Necromancer, deal with these scum."
"115740052-0-33205";"Daedra. A parting gift from the Ayleids?"
"115740052-0-33206";"Euraxia tricked you, old wizard. You brought the Wrathstone here. Its magic will unlock the vault!"
"115740052-0-33207";"We have an endless supply of undead, you fools!"
"115740052-0-33208";"Relish your victory while you can. We'll reach the weapon before you."
"115740052-0-33209";"And who do we have here? Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-33210";"Well done, cat. I barely regret your presence now."
"115740052-0-33211";"We need to get that door open."
"115740052-0-33212";"That did it. Hurry, this way."
"115740052-0-33213";"Hmm. Stay vigilant and look for a way inside."
"115740052-0-33214";"Undead! Keep them away from Tharn!"
"115740052-0-33215";"I see a panel. Hold them off!"
"115740052-0-33216";"That takes care of the poison."
"115740052-0-33217";"Jone and Jode! Was that an earthquake?"
"115740052-0-33220";"The Moon Gate you seek lies to the southwest. Zumog Phoom has the key. Now, about my request .…"
"115740052-0-33222";"The necromancers have already agreed to serve Kaalgrontiid. You no longer interest us, Euraxia Tharn."
"115740052-0-33223";"How dare you! We had a deal!"
"115740052-0-33224";"I'll take down that shield. You deal with the undead!"
"115740052-0-33225";"What's this now? My incompetent half-brother and … ah, the lost princess returns!"
"115740052-0-33226";"Here. Your parents have missed you so, princess!"
"115740052-0-33227";"Father, Mother … no!"
"115740052-0-33228";"How refreshing! Let's find the rest of me and put it back where it belongs."
"115740052-0-33229";"Ah, welcome back, little energy! I missed you so!"
"115740052-0-33230";"This architecture is definitely Ayleid. We're on the right path. Let's explore further."
"115740052-0-33232";"Five-claw, this one doesn't have much time."
"115740052-0-33234";"You really think you can stop me? Neither you nor that bumbling corpse stand a chance."
"115740052-0-33235";"Corpse!? I never! I'll have you know I'm barely one-quarter-cadaver on my mother's side!"
"115740052-0-33236";"Two of you can't exist in the same reality, Soul Shriven. The stronger the Betrayer becomes, the weaker you will grow."
"115740052-0-33240";"Imperials aren't known for their traps, but … looks clear."
"115740052-0-33241";"Oh, jolly good show! Of course, I planned to deal with the Orc myself, once my reanimation was complete."
"115740052-0-33245";"Case in point."
"115740052-0-33247";"For three thousand years I have protected the Wrathstone! I will not fail her now!"
"115740052-0-33248";"Now that I'm whole, I have a destiny to fulfill. So, cheerio!"
"115740052-0-33249";"Anequina was a Moon-Priest. Could that be the key to using the Dragonhorn?"
"115740052-0-33250";"The same notion occurred to me, Queen Khamira."
"115740052-0-33251";"Wait, here comes Tharn and the others. Five-claw, talk to me."
"115740052-0-33255";"Everyone! Meet in the royal study. I have something to show you!"
"115740052-0-33258";"Cadwell spoke of Anequina, one of Khunzar-ri's champions. He mentioned a key. I think he meant my pendant."
"115740052-0-33259";"Zamarak remembers. Your mother wore it before you. Does it have more than sentimental significance?"
"115740052-0-33260";"It hides me from magical detection. Mother would take my pendant in her hand and whisper, ""When Khunzar-ri smiled, Anequina asked the Moons to move for him."""
"115740052-0-33261";"I discovered as a young girl that the pendant and this ancient map interact in interesting ways."
"115740052-0-33262";"When Anequina's blood calls, the shadow dance begins!"
"115740052-0-33263";"By the Moons, you opened a path!"
"115740052-0-33264";"You go ahead. Zamarak and I will deal with the Dragon outside … somehow."
"115740052-0-33265";"Stand back. I'll use the Wrathstone to restore the seal."
"115740052-0-33267";"Hurry, wizard! You must hurry!"
"115740052-0-33268";"Seal, damn you! Seal!"
"115740052-0-33269";"I think … I think that did it."
"115740052-0-33270";"Oh, now what?"
"115740052-0-33271";"Dark moons! Get down!"
"115740052-0-33272";"Brothers, we are free!"
"115740052-0-33273";"The Dragons! You released them into Elsweyr!"
"115740052-0-33274";"I was trying to stop that from happening. The blame falls squarely on Captain Calsivius, I'm quite certain."
"115740052-0-33275";"He was working for your sister!"
"115740052-0-33276";"Half-sister! But let's finish this back at my camp."
"115740052-0-33278";"Glad you could make it. Quickly now, let's head inside."
"115740052-0-33279";"Well, that's certainly odd. There must be something here to take down that barrier."
"115740052-0-33282";"Necromancers. Only your sister would ally with such abominations."
"115740052-0-33283";"Half-sister. And who's to say the necromancer isn't the captain's pet?"
"115740052-0-33284";"Regardless, Euraxia apparently wants you dead."
"115740052-0-33285";"I have that effect on people—especially my relatives."
"115740052-0-33286";"Over here! I'm alive!"
"115740052-0-33287";"You could have waited for my portal. Never mind. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-33288";"Hrrm. What now, mage?"
"115740052-0-33289";"Isn't it obvious? Down."
"115740052-0-33290";"Down?"
"115740052-0-33291";"It appears to be the only way."
"115740052-0-33296";"We need to find the captain and end this."
"115740052-0-33297";"I'm well aware of the stakes, cat. Try to run faster."
"115740052-0-33298";"Imperials! You think Jone and Jode shine only upon you!"
"115740052-0-33300";"Another light puzzle? Well, go solve it! Time waits for no one, not even Abnur Tharn."
"115740052-0-33303";"Stop!"
"115740052-0-33304";"What now, cat? Have you forgotten that we're in a hurry?"
"115740052-0-33305";"These reliefs. They tell the story of Khunzar-ri and the Demons."
"115740052-0-33306";"Those aren't demons. They're Dragons!"
"115740052-0-33307";"Jode's light! The Dragons are the weapon! Euraxia wants to release Dragons!"
"115740052-0-33308";"Damn it all! I have no use for Dragons! Come on, let's put a stop to this."
"115740052-0-33310";"Damn, stupid doors! Why won't you open?"
"115740052-0-33311";"Stop! You will not release those beasts!"
"115740052-0-33312";"Queen Euraxia wants those Dragons—one way or another!"
"115740052-0-33313";"Too late, old wizard … too late …."
"115740052-0-33315";"Shut up, Quintus."
"115740052-0-33317";"Looks like that did it. Let's head in."
"115740052-0-33318";"Just what are you two doing here? Get out at once!"
"115740052-0-33319";"Seems this letter confirms that the magnate is descended from the Potentate. What a pity."
"115740052-0-33320";"Traitor! How dare you claim to be of my blood?"
"115740052-0-33321";"What? What's happening? Please, no!"
"115740052-0-33322";"Oh, fetch it all."
"115740052-0-33332";"Hey! You're not one of Jubani's thugs! Can you get me out of here?"
"115740052-0-33333";"I'm getting out of here. Catch up to me so I can thank you properly!"
"115740052-0-33334";"I see light! Real light! Just a little farther!"
"115740052-0-33335";"Too late, fools! The eclipse has started!"
"115740052-0-33336";"I'm going to share the power with the Dragons. Magnanimous, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-33339";"Glad you could make it."
"115740052-0-33343";"Very good, assassin scum. You and your companion have been most insistent. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-33344";"Well, seems like it's time to get going, then. I'll meet you in the town square."
"115740052-0-33345";"Keep your eye on the prize!"
"115740052-0-33346";"I'll keep my word."
"115740052-0-33347";"Proconsul Beloren-Kaie, I presume?"
"115740052-0-33349";"I'll be watching, Feina-Darak. Waiting for you to speak the truth."
"115740052-0-33354";"My family has long claimed to be descended from the Potentate. But this is not the truth."
"115740052-0-33355";"The man who founded the town, my ancestor, was a traitor. He betrayed Proconsul Beloren-Kaie and stole his name. My family's legacy … is only a lie."
"115740052-0-33357";"I revoke my title as magnate. And should you decide it, I will leave Hakoshae forever. This dishonor is mine to bear. And I accept it."
"115740052-0-33358";"No! We still want you to be our magnate!"
"115740052-0-33361";"That dark orb must be the heart of this trap, try to break it!"
"115740052-0-33362";"Struggle as you might, you cannot deny the will of Meridia. Her power is infinite."
"115740052-0-33367";"Brilliant revelation."
"115740052-0-33368";"What is her interest here?"
"115740052-0-33369";"That's everyone. Tasnasi must speak with you."
"115740052-0-33370";"Saw you heading this way. Find anything of interest?"
"115740052-0-33372";"Today we hit Khasda, right under his nose. We'll break into the basement of the Meirvale Keep through this sewer, so long as Vole can pick the locks."
"115740052-0-33373";"Locks. Cute. Might as well be fancifully knotted ribbons to me."
"115740052-0-33374";"Good. At the courtyard, we'll have sentries, but Sereyne's teleportation spell should let us pass unnoticed."
"115740052-0-33375";"And rob me of the satisfaction of watching you get yourself killed?"
"115740052-0-33376";"Ugh. Were you talking to me?"
"115740052-0-33377";"We'll enter the palace through a second floor storage room. Nazdar will scale the wall and drop a rope for us."
"115740052-0-33378";"As spake Urua the Observant, ""I see."""
"115740052-0-33379";"You'd have wound up like the rest of this sorry lot. Maybe sorrier. Not even the light of Meridia could improve your complexion."
"115740052-0-33381";"Tasnasi and the newcomer will handle any trouble that comes our way. Let's get started."
"115740052-0-33382";"That necklace must belong to Zinthia!"
"115740052-0-33383";"Come, let us speak away from this place."
"115740052-0-33384";"There's the lock. Watch my back, won't you?"
"115740052-0-33385";"One down! Let's get going!"
"115740052-0-33386";"Hmm. Might need an ebony pick for this one. You know the drill."
"115740052-0-33387";"Skooma. These vagrants must be smugglers!"
"115740052-0-33388";"A bit stiff, that one. Glad I keep machine grease in my hair."
"115740052-0-33389";"Khasda's done some redecorating, I see. Not sure I like it. Keep the coast clear, won't you?"
"115740052-0-33390";"There! Hopefully, that's the last of them. My fingers are getting sore."
"115740052-0-33391";"Hey! That's our way to the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-33392";"What happened? Where'd it go? There was a blinding flash and then … nothing."
"115740052-0-33393";"Oooh, my ears are burning hotter than Dagon's backside. Come on. Give'em a scratch, would ya?"
"115740052-0-33394";"Sereyne, it's your turn."
"115740052-0-33395";"Ugh. Everyone, stand still. You're making me queasy. Just need to concentrate."
"115740052-0-33396";"Oh, that's not good."
"115740052-0-33397";"<Vomits.>"
"115740052-0-33398";"Farewell, cheese of my dreams."
"115740052-0-33399";"You and I need to speak. Now."
"115740052-0-33400";"You made it? Both of you? Tasnasi is glad!"
"115740052-0-33401";"""The ascent of the body is nothing compared to that of the soul."" Saint Yosito spoke wisely."
"115740052-0-33402";"We need to talk."
"115740052-0-33403";"Why hello, sweetmeat. Care to play a game with old Tajirri?"
"115740052-0-33404";"I warned you, Thunderboots."
"115740052-0-33405";"And so the other thorn in my paw arrives."
"115740052-0-33407";"A very pretty scarf for smugglers to wear, yes? Perhaps it belongs to Zinthia."
"115740052-0-33408";"Dark Moons! They're smuggling spoiled moon-sugar. Very unsafe for anyone to eat."
"115740052-0-33409";"I warned you! Now the claws come out!"
"115740052-0-33410";"Rideza the Rogue, caught at last."
"115740052-0-33411";"Did you find my daughter? Where is she?"
"115740052-0-33412";"Here! Your daughter is right here, you old fool!"
"115740052-0-33413";"Rideza? You're the one who stole Zinthia? Oh, this one's poor ja'khajiit!"
"115740052-0-33414";"Ha! Feeling a little jealous? To go so far as to steal your father's pet."
"115740052-0-33416";"Hey! Over here!"
"115740052-0-33417";"Drinks are on Mizzik! Just as soon as he is paid, of course."
"115740052-0-33418";"Oh, for the love of—Dog droppings? All over my new sandals, too. Damn!"
"115740052-0-33419";"You were always naive, Tasnasi. You and Dasalzo both. So focused on the future that you never could see the knife behind you."
"115740052-0-33420";"By Jone, Tasnasi will claw your eyes out!"
"115740052-0-33421";"You have one friend left in this world, it seems. Not for much longer. Cud!"
"115740052-0-33422";"Speaker! We have news."
"115740052-0-33423";"Report, Khamira."
"115740052-0-33424";"Get these ropes off of me! Jubani and I had a deal! I delivered!"
"115740052-0-33425";"True, but why keep paying when we can just make you do it for free?"
"115740052-0-33426";"Now get inside!"
"115740052-0-33427";"Get back, Rakazsa! I won't let you have this one."
"115740052-0-33428";"Hah. Your blood is too thin. Keep that one as a gift, Yushiha, for when you're ready to drink."
"115740052-0-33429";"<Loud snoring.>"
"115740052-0-33430";"Mm … another round, sweetmeat …."
"115740052-0-33431";"Do not listen to his sweet talk!"
"115740052-0-33432";"The Euraxians have necromancers in their ranks."
"115740052-0-33433";"The Usurper Queen dares send undead against us? Five-claw, find Captain Nala-do and warn her!"
"115740052-0-33434";"Strike hard! Drive back the Euraxians! Five-claw, did the Speaker send orders?"
"115740052-0-33436";"Your claws are dull, as always, Yushiha. Remember what I said, walker."
"115740052-0-33437";"Meet me outside!"
"115740052-0-33438";"Feel that? A chill breeze. We must be nearing an exit!"
"115740052-0-33439";"Unclean!"
"115740052-0-33440";"You defy our Lady of Light and desecrate her domain with the undead! I will bleach your souls free of all you ever were!"
"115740052-0-33441";"Zargha thinks the Moon-Bishop will like his pretty butterflies. We won't tell her the big one got away."
"115740052-0-33442";"Damn it! Quintus, get back here!"
"115740052-0-33443";"Ah! The Pneumeria Chamber!"
"115740052-0-33444";"Finally! Free!"
"115740052-0-33445";"What part of until death do us part do you not understand?"
"115740052-0-33446";"I was planning to send you on your way once we got out of this, Quintus, but you just couldn't resist a chance to kill me."
"115740052-0-33447";"No! Damn you! Let me out of here!"
"115740052-0-33448";"Grave robbing cur!"
"115740052-0-33454";"Zamarak will go with you!"
"115740052-0-33457";"The impure defile our domain. Bathe them in her radiance until their souls are scorched pure!"
"115740052-0-33459";"Gharesh-ri, no!"
"115740052-0-33460";"This one hates killing the same fools again and again!"
"115740052-0-33461";"Never mind. It doesn't matter how you got rid of it, it's gone."
"115740052-0-33462";"Let's get out of here while we can."
"115740052-0-33464";"Go, now five-claw!"
"115740052-0-33465";"My shield won't hold much longer!"
"115740052-0-33466";"Good work, walker. Keep searching and put that key to good use."
"115740052-0-33469";"The Dragonhorn! It's our only chance!"
"115740052-0-33470";"I'll catch up after I've led this one to safety."
"115740052-0-33471";"Close call. Don't worry. This one will be safe with me."
"115740052-0-33474";"Five-claw, Mulaamnir and Kaalgrontiid approach!"
"115740052-0-33475";"Khajiit treated no better than animals. Shameful."
"115740052-0-33476";"You go on. I'll watch over them."
"115740052-0-33479";"Rakazsa! I warned you retribution would come if you hunted Khajiit as prey! Step down and our clan might yet be redeemed!"
"115740052-0-33480";"The necromancer's spell will animate every corpse in town, but this one has an idea."
"115740052-0-33481";"Oh, <<1>>. My sweet boy. I don't … it's not fair."
"115740052-0-33489";"No, <<1>>! Stop! You're killing him!"
"115740052-0-33493";"Now, this is a little unorthodox, but I just felt horrible about what happened."
"115740052-0-33494";"<<1>>, no! Stop it this instant! Please?"
"115740052-0-33495";"It's you who led this hunter to our den, Yushiha, not me. Unlike our Clan Mother, I am prepared for our enemies. Hunt me if you dare."
"115740052-0-33496";"Rakazsa! Rakazsa!"
"115740052-0-33501";"Hah! This one has you now pretty butterfly!"
"115740052-0-33517";"Hoo hoo! You smashed that as flat as a flapjack! But who said you could play with my toys?"
"115740052-0-33521";"Oh, hello! You always find things in the last place you look!"
"115740052-0-33522";"No, no! Stop this madness. Why can't you see reason?"
"115740052-0-33523";"Best hurry or you'll miss the show!"
"115740052-0-33524";"It is so high. Khenarthi, please lend this one your wings."
"115740052-0-33525";"Oh, no you don't. Get your paws off my favorite plaything!"
"115740052-0-33526";"Yes. I—I need to sit down. Gather my thoughts …."
"115740052-0-33527";"This one cannot venture too far. Speak to Captain Shideya when you're ready to resume!"
"115740052-0-33528";"This one cannot venture too far. Speak to Captain Shideya when you're ready to resume!"
"115740052-0-33529";"Come on, plaything! The game's a face! Haha!"
"115740052-0-33538";"Stand back."
"115740052-0-33539";"Mithralas elanthanal cueridanare!"
"115740052-0-33540";"Where am—? You! You must … you must listen!"
"115740052-0-33541";"Speak with him. Quickly."
"115740052-0-33542";"You can't escape my mind trap! I'll destroy you with your darkest fears!"
"115740052-0-33543";"Not so fast, little worm! Let's see how you fare against this nightmare!"
"115740052-0-33544";"No more! Release me! Please!"
"115740052-0-33545";"Azura have mercy on him. I'd say he learned his lesson."
"115740052-0-33550";"Who will confirm that Khamira is the daughter of King Hemakar and the rightful heir to the throne of Anequina?"
"115740052-0-33551";"Come forth, daughter of Hemakar and Numara. Come forth, child of Anequina!"
"115740052-0-33552";"Khamira, do you accept the duties of the throne? Will you lead this kingdom and protect its people?"
"115740052-0-33553";"I do and I will."
"115740052-0-33554";"Sacred Moons, I don't know what to do with your warning. Why won't you guide me when I need you now, more than ever?"
"115740052-0-33555";"Know, then, that the Mane accepts and recognizes your claim. All hail Khamira, Queen of Anequina!"
"115740052-0-33557";"I promise to serve our people. And I offer thanks to all who helped achieve our recent victories!"
"115740052-0-33561";"Ooo, how the moons twinkle in those glassy eyes. You want to stare off into space and time? I'll show you the future-past at present!"
"115740052-0-33566";"Ah, cream! Oh, I haven't had cream since I made Otar cry over it!"
"115740052-0-33567";"This portal will transport you to Redfur Trading Post. I'll catch up with you after I pay my respects to Old Grandfather."
"115740052-0-33568";"I—I must see. Sacred sugar, uncloud my eyes …."
"115740052-0-33569";"Hey! I just messed that up!"
"115740052-0-33570";"Can't leave a good mess unattended for one minute before some hero comes to clean it up! Go tidy your own drawers!"
"115740052-0-33572";"This one will stay here at your side until you are ready to return to the palace, commander."
"115740052-0-33573";"This one has learned much. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-33574";"This one has learned much. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-33575";"For her, we kept it hidden from our brethren and buried them with our tears. Here you too will drown."
"115740052-0-33576";"I have seen it! I have seen the way forward! Jone and Jode have shown me how we may protect our temple!"
"115740052-0-33577";"Bless your eyes, Moon-Bishop! What must we do?"
"115740052-0-33578";"We must create an anchor beneath Two Moons to hold our temple between Two Moons!"
"115740052-0-33579";"Apologies, Moon-Bishop. This one does not see …."
"115740052-0-33582";"So, moon-sugar disappears from M'zum's stores as well. Interesting."
"115740052-0-33583";"Now for the story no teaching stone can tell."
"115740052-0-33584";"Arum-Khal served our order for many years as our greatest champion. But as his power grew, so did his pride. In time, he renounced his faith in Azurah and turned to the dark path. The way of the dro-m'Athra."
"115740052-0-33585";"Many adepts fell under his sway, and the order collapsed into civil war. The battles sundered the temple and blighted the canyon below. We triumphed in the end, but Arum-Khal would not die. He fled—seeking refuge in one of his orbs."
"115740052-0-33586";"We locked the orbs away, but now our wards grow brittle, and Arum-Khal prepares to emerge once again. Only a warrior of the Hidden Moon can end this—and only with the powers of the Moonlight Blade."
"115740052-0-33590";"They spilled blood in this sacred place."
"115740052-0-33591";"This creature was attacked by something unnatural, that much is clear."
"115740052-0-33592";"First M'zum loses moon-sugar, now his farmers won't work? What nonsense!"
"115740052-0-33593";"There is something out there, M'zum. Some sort of beast."
"115740052-0-33594";"Bah! A beast? This one sees no beast! All he sees are lazy Khajiit who make up foolish lies!"
"115740052-0-33596";"The farmers of Merryvale are no strangers to beasts. What could have scared M'zum's workers this badly?"
"115740052-0-33597";"Now Zamarak and the prayer are one. Come, let us find the blessed Pillar of the Spring Moon."
"115740052-0-33599";"Please, someone help! A monster is attacking the farm!"
"115740052-0-33600";"Quickly, go on ahead and find J'dathal. Raz will help our friend here."
"115740052-0-33601";"Deal with the undead while Zamarak recites the prayer."
"115740052-0-33602";"Dark Moons, a Daedra! Raz hates those things!"
"115740052-0-33603";"Va qri tashiin …."
"115740052-0-33606";"It was not you, Sizenza, it was the Skooma Cat that brought these misfortunes."
"115740052-0-33607";"Haduras. What … what have I done?"
"115740052-0-33608";"Mother! Rakhzargo found a new farmhand."
"115740052-0-33609";"Yes, sweet one, thank you. They're going to look into our troubles, right after they wake up your brother."
"115740052-0-33610";"Brother is still sleeping? Rakhzargo rose at dawn and has been working hard all day!"
"115740052-0-33611";"If only your brother were as dutiful as you."
"115740052-0-33613";"The Spring Moon has sanctified the ground. Let us proceed to the Summer Moon."
"115740052-0-33614";"Let's return to Mother's farm and discuss what we learned."
"115740052-0-33615";"Razum! Your mother sends you to find our missing farmhands and this is where you end up? Our house?"
"115740052-0-33616";"We already searched M'zum's plantation. Raz came back to warn you about—"
"115740052-0-33617";"Excuses! And this one thought you learned more in your travels than which taverns served the cheapest ale!"
"115740052-0-33618";"You better go, five-claw. This may take some time."
"115740052-0-33619";"One more, the Pillar of the Winter Moon, near K'har Zhab Hall."
"115740052-0-33621";"Raz sees nothing out of the ordinary."
"115740052-0-33622";"No clues to be found here, it seems."
"115740052-0-33623";"Let's look somewhere else."
"115740052-0-33624";"Hmm. That is a rather ornate tapestry for the cellar. Mother, did you hang this?"
"115740052-0-33625";"Submit to the Lady of Light, and be cleansed."
"115740052-0-33626";"This is where you search for the farmhands? Our cellar? What, are they hiding in the walls?"
"115740052-0-33628";"What? No, of course not. Who would Mother be trying to impress, the cellar rats?"
"115740052-0-33630";"The caves branch here. You should follow the corridor, while Raz takes this side passage. We'll meet up farther ahead."
"115740052-0-33631";"There you are, five-claw! Time to put an end to this skooma operation, yes?"
"115740052-0-33632";"Sleek work, five-claw. Now, let's head back to Mother's farm."
"115740052-0-33633";"Va qri jashiin …."
"115740052-0-33634";"Vaba qri frisiin …."
"115740052-0-33640";"Well, it seems you're good for something at least."
"115740052-0-33642";"Good for something? Raz took down an entire skooma operation, for Jode's sake!"
"115740052-0-33643";"Rakhzargo, shush. Queen Ayrenn? Razum, what is he talking about?"
"115740052-0-33644";"Razum-dar! Sir! I have an urgent message for you from Queen Ayrenn!"
"115740052-0-33645";"A message for Raz? Ha! Who would waste paper on him?"
"115740052-0-33649";"Raz's next assignment. It seems this one's vacation is over, Mother."
"115740052-0-33650";"Grand Chancellor, I propose that you get Gharesh-ri to pardon the Cygnus Irregulars so we can form an alliance."
"115740052-0-33652";"Yet another mess for Raz to clean up. Ah, well. So it goes."
"115740052-0-33653";"Now's our chance to end this, once and for all!"
"115740052-0-33654";"So you're the ones interfering in my operation? You'll pay dearly for that."
"115740052-0-33656";"Well done, sword-wielder. The power of the Moonlight Blade is waking."
"115740052-0-33657";"I can feel the power returning. Every dark spirit strengthens the blade's connection to the Crossing—the bridge between Nirni and what lies beyond."
"115740052-0-33658";"These spirits know nothing but hunger. One day they will repent of their sins. Not today, though. So we banish them, back to the void."
"115740052-0-33659";"Let us search for signs of thievery. And if Raz's family decides to poke their snouts in, ignore them. The less attention we give, the quicker they will leave."
"115740052-0-33660";"Good! The Moonlight Blade sings the Hidden Moon's song again. Take it to Azurah's Gate. We will speak further there."
"115740052-0-33661";"Such pathetic creatures. Flee before Kaalgrontiid, you insignificant morsels!"
"115740052-0-33664";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-33665";"It's working! The dead are dead again!"
"115740052-0-33666";"Wait … something … something is coming."
"115740052-0-33669";"Hmm. Examine the moons on each statue."
"115740052-0-33670";"Fascinating. It must have something to do with the direction of the light."
"115740052-0-33671";"According to the poem, the full moons and the new moons are the key."
"115740052-0-33672";"Knowledge can only be found in the dark. Could that refer to the new moons?"
"115740052-0-33673";"Ignore any statues displaying a full moon, I think."
"115740052-0-33674";"Hmm. Some of the words have been chipped away. See what you can make of it."
"115740052-0-33675";"Some of these moon tiles are identical. Try different combinations of the mirrored pairs."
"115740052-0-33677";"Azurah. Upon all the spirits of my fallen kin I pray, lend me strength."
"115740052-0-33680";"Stand in the ritual circle and raise the Moonlight Blade. I will do the rest."
"115740052-0-33681";"Lost and shattered light, come forth! Cast off your shadows and heed my call!"
"115740052-0-33682";"Shando-ri is whole? Azurah shows me mercy."
"115740052-0-33683";"Shando … is that you?"
"115740052-0-33693";"This one will order the retreat."
"115740052-0-33694";"No. Riverhold belongs to the Khajiit."
"115740052-0-33695";"Now I will speak the words my people need to hear!"
"115740052-0-33696";"We are Khajiit! We are the children of Alkosh, the daughters and sons of Jone and Jode! We do not run, even from Dragons!"
"115740052-0-33697";"Behold, child. Shando-ri. Guardian of the Moonlight Blade."
"115740052-0-33698";"Know that if you take the sword, you take an oath to destroy Arum-Khal, as well."
"115740052-0-33699";"Come, fool, give your soul to me!"
"115740052-0-33700";"Azurah-blessed! Your soul belongs to the Void!"
"115740052-0-33701";"Shando! How did you—?"
"115740052-0-33702";"Through faith and loyalty, brother."
"115740052-0-33703";"You always did underestimate me, Shando."
"115740052-0-33704";"Destroying me will not save you, brother. Another wields the Moonlight Blade."
"115740052-0-33705";"And they will share your fate soon enough."
"115740052-0-33706";"I arrive too late. Damn! The veil is paper thin near the orb, friend. Use the Moonlight Blade! It might allow you to widen the breach."
"115740052-0-33707";"Bahlokdaan! Prove your worth. Destroy these paltry insects!"
"115740052-0-33708";"She's the Queen of Anequina!"
"115740052-0-33709";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-33710";"I see them, just up ahead!"
"115740052-0-33711";"Still you hunt me, assassin scum? Was my death not enough?"
"115740052-0-33712";"The corruption here is just suffocating. Like a dark fog rising from below, bidding the dead to serve."
"115740052-0-33713";"Good. I sense … yes, some kind of wards infused into the architecture, though weakened by the march of time. Someone tried to prevent this."
"115740052-0-33714";"Excellent. My sight grows clearer. I see a maze of catacombs below. Undead rise there too. And something else."
"115740052-0-33715";"Ah, there's a concentration of dark energy in the exposed tomb at the center of the Scar. Meet me there."
"115740052-0-33719";"Yes, captain, the scouts report the Euraxians are marching in this direction."
"115740052-0-33720";"As we expected. Now move. We still have much to do before they get here."
"115740052-0-33721";"Traps. They stopped some of the assassins, but not all of them. We must be wary."
"115740052-0-33722";"Another maze! We must find a way to the other side."
"115740052-0-33723";"Now Dragonguard, you and your order die!"
"115740052-0-33725";"That's enough cat and mouse for one day, plaything."
"115740052-0-33726";"With me. Stay close. We will hunt these necromancers down and end this Dragon."
"115740052-0-33727";"The path splits here. We will go right. Walker, you stay left. Moons guide us."
"115740052-0-33729";"Easy now, walker. You are all right. This is Star Haven, home to peaceful adepts."
"115740052-0-33730";"There is a letter, and a key to the door on the dresser."
"115740052-0-33731";"Zamarak will see you at the farm."
"115740052-0-33732";"Ah, there you are. See to Cadwell, if you would. Then join us in the throne room for the war council."
"115740052-0-33733";"Escape this nightmare! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-33734";"Another shred of a habit? The blood seems more spotty. From a sore, maybe? Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-33735";"The blood trail goes cold, yes? But what is that? A cameo? The face looks …. This was not dropped by accident, walker. There must be more to find."
"115740052-0-33736";"This is a nursery rhyme, isn't it? Like the one Vazbi read every night as a kitten. S'rendarr's mercy. Please, hurry, walker!"
"115740052-0-33737";"Swaddle cloth? Vazbi recognizes that pattern. Come, let's keep looking! Come!"
"115740052-0-33738";"And we find a Death Coin last, of course. Something that gleams to take to the Sands Behind the Stars. We should talk."
"115740052-0-33739";"The Moon Pillars are activated. Riverhold is sanctified."
"115740052-0-33740";"Stand with me, people of Anequina! For I am Khamira, daughter of King Hemakar! I am your queen!"
"115740052-0-33741";"Sleek and lively! Grab what you can!"
"115740052-0-33743";"Riverhold, with cats so bold! I'll see you there, if truth be told!"
"115740052-0-33744";"Well fought! We have shown that the Khajiit will not run. Not even from a Dragon!"
"115740052-0-33745";"We have plans to make! War council, with me!"
"115740052-0-33746";"Got you!"
"115740052-0-33748";"Uncanny! It looks just like the lovely place I dreamed about. Must be why my portals led me here. Eventually."
"115740052-0-33749";"Ah! I am going to need a bigger net!"
"115740052-0-33750";"Did you hear that, my trusty shovel? Dragons! And mysterious graves! It's just like old times!"
"115740052-0-33751";"Oh no! You smashed it! Such pretty colors leaking out."
"115740052-0-33752";"Foul creatures! Cut them down!"
"115740052-0-33753";"For Elsweyr! For the Mane!"
"115740052-0-33754";"Our enemy awaits, five-claw! Destroy the necromancer!"
"115740052-0-33755";"Dragonfire! Move!"
"115740052-0-33756";"Sheathe your weapons, little morsel. Mulaamnir would talk to you."
"115740052-0-33757";"Leave Elsweyr, little morsel. Tell the battlemage. If I see you again, you will die."
"115740052-0-33759";"Ah, there you are! Spare a moment for a chit-chat, hmm?"
"115740052-0-33760";"For surviving a Dragon attack, you look well. The healers did an admirable job, yes?"
"115740052-0-33761";"Yes! Sizenza! Show us the way!"
"115740052-0-33764";"Ah, good. You're awake. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-33766";"I do. Five-claw, let us speak."
"115740052-0-33767";"Interesting. You're not one of Euraxia's mercenaries."
"115740052-0-33768";"Ooo, yarn! Hee hee hee! Look at it come apart!"
"115740052-0-33770";"Quit your raveling! I was batting her thoughts into a glorious tangle before you came along! Now I'm going to have to start again!"
"115740052-0-33771";"You think you can keep me from my vengeance? Come, then!"
"115740052-0-33772";"Vazbi …. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-33773";"Gah! You slippery bastard!"
"115740052-0-33774";"You should have left me dead, Tharayya. I'll haunt you to your grave."
"115740052-0-33775";"So a tiger walks among the cattle. You were with Yushiha, yes?"
"115740052-0-33776";"I'll get to the far bastion. Best we don't travel together."
"115740052-0-33777";"Five-claw! Over here! Tharn wants to speak to you."
"115740052-0-33778";"We must do something about the water, Silhu-jo! If you would just—"
"115740052-0-33779";"No adept can face the wastes alone, child. This one insists you stay."
"115740052-0-33780";"Ah, here come Queen Euraxia's guests now."
"115740052-0-33781";"I don't like the looks of these meddlers. I say we feed them to the Dragons and be done with it."
"115740052-0-33782";"Now, about the rest of my body, O pestilent one …."
"115740052-0-33783";"Your insults won't hasten the process, Betrayer."
"115740052-0-33784";"But there's a terrible draft in what used to be my nether regions!"
"115740052-0-33785";"My friend!"
"115740052-0-33786";"Work! Farmhands needed at Mother's farm!"
"115740052-0-33787";"Rakhzargo's mother is very nice! He promises!"
"115740052-0-33788";"Rakhzargo works so hard."
"115740052-0-33789";"Presenting Abnur Tharn, Grand Chancellor and Overlord of Nibenay, Imperial Battlemage of the Elder Council, and Patriarch of the Tharn dynasty. And his bodyguard."
"115740052-0-33790";"Ah, half-brother, your arrival, it's so … unexceptional."
"115740052-0-33791";"Pretending to be a queen isn't—"
"115740052-0-33792";"Hush, Abnur, you bore me. Bodyguard! You look interesting. Come talk to me."
"115740052-0-33793";"You heard her. Good luck."
"115740052-0-33794";"Stop this! Star Haven's adepts are peaceful!"
"115740052-0-33795";"Rakazsa, you damned fool …  come, we should get back to the caravan survivors. This way."
"115740052-0-33796";"Another corpse for our army! How grand."
"115740052-0-33797";"Thank Jone and Jode you arrived."
"115740052-0-33798";"There is the door to the crypts. Let us see if the master key still works."
"115740052-0-33799";"Guards! Take them to the dungeons!"
"115740052-0-33800";"Treachery? How could I ever have anticipated this?"
"115740052-0-33801";"Enough! Zumog Phoom, what news do you bring?"
"115740052-0-33802";"The Desert Wind Adeptorium has fallen. We move against Riverhold on your word."
"115740052-0-33803";"Then the word is given. Now, half-brother—"
"115740052-0-33804";"What? Who is there? This one's head may ache but that does not mean he cannot defend himself!"
"115740052-0-33805";"I think not!"
"115740052-0-33806";"The Dragon may be subdued, but not for long. This one fears for those inside the adeptorium."
"115740052-0-33807";"Then Zamarak and the traveler will go. You should take this chance to escape."
"115740052-0-33808";"Ma'jha-dro will not run while his disciples are in danger!"
"115740052-0-33809";"As you wish. Let us be quick, then."
"115740052-0-33810";"Invaders! This one will not allow you to enter this holy place!"
"115740052-0-33811";"Let us leave this place before the beast returns."
"115740052-0-33812";"Why did the Dragon flee?"
"115740052-0-33813";"It was called away. This one heard its name on the wind. Bahlokdaan."
"115740052-0-33814";"Called away? Do the Dragons work together?"
"115740052-0-33815";"Perhaps. At the very least, this Dragon seems to have allied himself with the Euraxians."
"115740052-0-33816";"Then the rebellion has begun."
"115740052-0-33817";"Nine winds, no! Get to the door!"
"115740052-0-33818";"Go, save the Grand Adept! Zamarak cannot hold this for long."
"115740052-0-33819";"Yes, this one is afraid it has."
"115740052-0-33820";"Go. This one will find another way inside."
"115740052-0-33823";"Come, traveler. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-33824";"You are wrong. The secret belongs to me."
"115740052-0-33825";"What the battlemage knew in life, she whispers to me in death. Soon Riverhold will fall and the Betrayer will be restored."
"115740052-0-33827";"Grand Adept Ma'jha-dro? What will we do now?"
"115740052-0-33828";"Star Haven is no longer safe. Who knows when it will be attacked again?"
"115740052-0-33829";"This one hasn't visited these crypts in a long, long time."
"115740052-0-33831";"Let the fourth wind open the way!"
"115740052-0-33832";"Grand Adept … no …."
"115740052-0-33833";"Zamarak has failed. This one was too slow. Again."
"115740052-0-33835";"How good it feels to spar with a student again. Come now, let us continue to the adeptorium."
"115740052-0-33836";"Wait. Did you hear that?"
"115740052-0-33837";"A Dragon! Look out!"
"115740052-0-33838";"You must help the other adepts. Take the passage through the catacombs. This one must go warn Zamarak!"
"115740052-0-33839";"That's it! Time to give you knaves what for!"
"115740052-0-33840";"Have you ever visited a Rimmen workhouse? They treat the Khajiiti workers worse than slaves."
"115740052-0-33841";"It's that building over there. For most of Rimmen's Khajiit, it's the only job available to them."
"115740052-0-33842";"Now let's visit the Rimmen marketplace."
"115740052-0-33843";"Take a look around. Business seems to be thriving, but appearances can be deceiving."
"115740052-0-33844";"Come along. I want to show you the improvements Euraxia made to the palace walls."
"115740052-0-33845";"See the trebuchets? Notice how they're aimed into the city below."
"115740052-0-33846";"When we get to the palace, let me do the talking. As the elder Tharn, I'll demonstrate my dominance over Euraxia and negotiate a cessation of hostilities."
"115740052-0-33847";"Seal the gates! Let no Euraxian enter this holy place!"
"115740052-0-33848";"You're too late. The Grand Adept revealed all before I killed her."
"115740052-0-33849";"This … this can't be happening!"
"115740052-0-33850";"No, please! Noooo!"
"115740052-0-33853";"There are too many of us. We need to split up."
"115740052-0-33854";"Here come the others now."
"115740052-0-33855";"Very good, my pet. That should distract those farmers for quite awhile."
"115740052-0-33856";"An intruder! Quick, Dolor, kill them at once!"
"115740052-0-33857";"Hrrm. I will go with Tharn, Captain Nala-do can lead the others."
"115740052-0-33858";"I'll scout ahead! Tally-ho!"
"115740052-0-33859";"There they are!"
"115740052-0-33860";"Moons be praised, thank you both! Because of your help, this one's family is safe."
"115740052-0-33861";"Unfortunately."
"115740052-0-33862";"Raz is so pleased to see you and your daughters unharmed. All … three of your daughters."
"115740052-0-33863";"Yes, Raz. And all three of us have been talking quite a bit about you."
"115740052-0-33864";"Specifically how you seemed to have made certain promises. To all of us."
"115740052-0-33865";"Do you remember, Razum-dar? ""Oh, this one will love you forever. This one will come back for you soon. This one only has eyes for you!"""
"115740052-0-33866";"What? Raz, is … is this true?"
"115740052-0-33867";"Now, now. Raz can explain everything."
"115740052-0-33868";"We can reach the Royal Chambers through the Chapel of the Guiding Moons and the Great Hall."
"115740052-0-33869";"Look at it all. I should have let you have Volenfell."
"115740052-0-33871";"The Chapel of the Guiding Moons is just ahead!"
"115740052-0-33872";"Not so fast, walker. Rajhin would first have a word with you."
"115740052-0-33873";"Then Najirra will go alone! She will not sit idle while her friends suffer!"
"115740052-0-33874";"Please, don't be foolish! Najirra! Wait!"
"115740052-0-33875";"Well, look who we got here! Intruders. Oh, you're going to get in trouble."
"115740052-0-33877";"Leaving so soon? Well, Raz will wait here for you then."
"115740052-0-33878";"By the way, if you see Pacrooti? Tell him he still owes this one a pouch of gold."
"115740052-0-33879";"Oooh, that hits the spot! Did you know I used to be a high chancellor? No, wait, that bit belongs to Abnur."
"115740052-0-33880";"Leave the door to Zamarak. This one will make an exit."
"115740052-0-33883";"Go. Zamarak will guard your backs."
"115740052-0-33886";"Go left while this one goes right! We will meet in the Royal Chambers!"
"115740052-0-33887";"You think I left Cyrodiil for a few pieces of gold? We need to double our production!"
"115740052-0-33888";"The time for stealth and subterfuge is ending. Soon we will launch a raid on the farms!"
"115740052-0-33889";"Patience, Timtem, patience. We'll find the one who killed your brother and flay them alive!"
"115740052-0-33890";"It feels like … I'm fading away …."
"115740052-0-33891";"Please … not like this …."
"115740052-0-33892";"Try smashing these … glass baubles …."
"115740052-0-33893";"There. Make haste. Euraxia is in the palace courtyard with Mulaamnir."
"115740052-0-33894";"Be cautious. We need to know what Euraxia and the Dragon are planning before we attack."
"115740052-0-33896";"Nala-do!"
"115740052-0-33900";"Moons above, let J'dathal's family be safe."
"115740052-0-33901";"This throne … for too long a tyrant has sat upon it. But now …?"
"115740052-0-33902";"The Mane must recognize you as the heir of Anequina, but the people already cheer your name."
"115740052-0-33903";"Finally! This palace is a labyrinth! Did I miss anything?"
"115740052-0-33904";"We will deal with the fallen later. I fear more pressing matters must concern us now."
"115740052-0-33905";"Azurah's pet arrives at last. I will teach you to fear the dark."
"115740052-0-33906";"You dare to face me here? Come, then, and join Shando in the void!"
"115740052-0-33907";"Your corruption runs deep, but her purity is limitless. You will be cleansed."
"115740052-0-33908";"I will not fail her …."
"115740052-0-33909";"We will find you. Her reach is boundless!"
"115740052-0-33912";"<Rude Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33913";"Now, Burr, you wouldn't want someone to say that about your mother, would you?"
"115740052-0-33914";"<Flippant Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33915";"What do you mean you ate your mother?"
"115740052-0-33916";"<Complaining Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33917";"Well, they disappeared, Burr. Nobody knows what happened to them. That's why we're looking for answers."
"115740052-0-33918";"<Muttered Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33919";"Well … I'm sure your tribe looked just as hard for you. I just found you first."
"115740052-0-33920";"<Gnawing, frustrated Goblin noises.>"
"115740052-0-33921";"Burr! Skeevatons are not for eating!"
"115740052-0-33922";"<Exasperated Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33923";"You shouldn't eat those either. Do you have any idea where they've been? Oh, you do …."
"115740052-0-33924";"<Pouting Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33925";"I'm so sorry, Burr. I tried to resolve things peacefully."
"115740052-0-33926";"<Dismissive Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33927";"Oh, it means to resolve a conflict without violence. Yes, that's a good thing!"
"115740052-0-33928";"<Suspicious Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33929";"Hm? I just thought you looked hungry. You don't want to eat?"
"115740052-0-33930";"<Suspicious Goblin gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-33931";"For the last time, Burr. I'm not trying to fatten you up."
"115740052-0-33932";"You'll need to operate them manually. I'll guide you through it."
"115740052-0-33933";"Saviwa can live with your constant glowing, but not your constant talking."
"115740052-0-33934";"What sort of Khajiit doesn't want to carry his ancestor's ashes around? Your great-great-great grandmother spent a lot of gold on this urn, you know."
"115740052-0-33935";"Remind me to ask Saviwa why these two urns are so much bigger than mine."
"115740052-0-33936";"I guess you have to chop me … him … up again. Tell Khamira, she has the key. And look after little Honor. He's a good steed …."
"115740052-0-33941";"Yes, this should do it."
"115740052-0-33942";"The Shadow Dance Temple ruins? Is that where the Betrayer has gone?"
"115740052-0-33944";"Jora-ri remembers visiting this tomb with his brother once."
"115740052-0-33945";"Finally! A tomb fit for a k'har!"
"115740052-0-33946";"Khamira's waiting for you inside. If the Dragon circling overhead spots us, I'll try to drive it off."
"115740052-0-33947";"Zamarak will assist."
"115740052-0-33948";"Yes, I'm sure your fists will make all the difference."
"115740052-0-33949";"I'm sure Saviwa will be pleased to know that I won't be bothering him any longer."
"115740052-0-33951";"Moons watch over you. Come, five-claw, let us see where this leads."
"115740052-0-33953";"Please, is anyone there?"
"115740052-0-33954";"Thank you, stranger. This one will find her way out."
"115740052-0-33955";"Enough, Landal. Our escort has arrived."
"115740052-0-33956";"Come over by the fire, I'll fill you in on the details."
"115740052-0-33957";"How beautiful! Why was this hidden for so long?"
"115740052-0-33958";"Of course! Though this one will admit, he is not very skillful."
"115740052-0-33959";"Najirra … should have listened to Iokkas."
"115740052-0-33960";"Thank you for saving this foolish one, walker. She should not have returned."
"115740052-0-33961";"Tajirri, is that you? We need more groceries for the house, there's barely anything to eat. And would it kill you to tidy up our room once in awhile? The upstairs is a mess."
"115740052-0-33962";"Did Iokkas make this? Raebanji must thank him."
"115740052-0-33963";"Is Raebanji to die here?"
"115740052-0-33964";"There! Use the skeevaton's ability to absorb energy and charge it up."
"115740052-0-33967";"Finally, the other half of the Wrathstone. Just as I expected."
"115740052-0-33968";"Hardly looks Dwarven to me."
"115740052-0-33969";"That's because it isn't, but it is a match to this tablet."
"115740052-0-33972";"Soriel! Let's get this in the saddle bags. Carefully."
"115740052-0-33973";"Well, you have both hunks of rock. Have you laid the secrets of the universe bare?"
"115740052-0-33974";"Not yet, Landal, but this will point the way."
"115740052-0-33975";"You can count us out of whatever you're planning next. I've had enough of this madness."
"115740052-0-33976";"Psst! Over here."
"115740052-0-33987";"A dip in Coldharbour's refreshing plasm and I'm fit as a fig tree! Now, where's the evil me?"
"115740052-0-33990";"Good to be working. You're less of a taskmaster than Jubani. Now, let's find some more locks."
"115740052-0-33991";"They're through. No lagging behind."
"115740052-0-33992";"Keep up, old timer. I made it and I can barely walk straight."
"115740052-0-33993";"""Gaze in wonder at the infirm, for their aches are the song of long life."""
"115740052-0-33994";"Nice to see you back at work, Vole."
"115740052-0-33995";"Good luck. And work quickly."
"115740052-0-33996";"Focus the power … imagine the destination. All right—here we go."
"115740052-0-33997";"I swear, it's not the fumes. I heard someone in the central chamber."
"115740052-0-33998";"It is all right, Lara-Tan. I believe you."
"115740052-0-33999";"What the—"
"115740052-0-34000";"So far so good. Now Vole …."
"115740052-0-34002";"You're sure—"
"115740052-0-34003";"You did it! Now solve the other side."
"115740052-0-34004";"The door is open! Come, hurry!"
"115740052-0-34005";"To quote the barkeep, ""you look sick—"""
"115740052-0-34006";"You have the key, yes? If you would open the cage then."
"115740052-0-34007";"Praise Azurah for your timely intervention, rhook."
"115740052-0-34008";"Come now, let us speak outside."
"115740052-0-34009";"Whew. Thought I lost you."
"115740052-0-34010";"This one prefers his feet."
"115740052-0-34011";"Speak to Ishu and see what he knows of these smugglers. Then let us meet back at the tavern. We have much to discuss!"
"115740052-0-34012";"""Walk softly,"" Master Hen-do taught me. If we get into trouble, be warned I cannot help. My fists are weapons no longer."
"115740052-0-34013";"The final finger of the Whispering Claw states: ""the claw that passes as a whisper is the mark of the master."""
"115740052-0-34014";"The fourth finger of the Whispering Claw states ""command the space to move through it unseen."""
"115740052-0-34015";"Heed the third finger of the Whispering Claw: ""distance is greater than any weapon."""
"115740052-0-34016";"As the second finger of the Whispering Claw says, ""Shadows consume curiosity, time, and interest."""
"115740052-0-34017";"""Soft as a whisper, quick as a shout,"" the first finger of the Whispering Claw teaches."
"115740052-0-34018";"Always a pleasure, Tharn. Try not to lose those stones."
"115740052-0-34019";"Summerset wine, eh? Not illegal, but incredibly taxed. Mizzik has a feeling this bottle didn't find its way to Riverhold through virtuous means."
"115740052-0-34020";"Ugh! If that cheese isn't illegal, it should be. What a smell!"
"115740052-0-34021";"Sorry about that. When this is all done, I'll buy you a drink—"
"115740052-0-34022";"Moon's Mercy, Sereyne! When we're done here I will smash every bottle of wine in Elsweyr."
"115740052-0-34023";"Not if I drink them first!"
"115740052-0-34024";"Nazdar, you're our way into this tower. Ready?"
"115740052-0-34027";"Mmm. Not good. I was afraid of this."
"115740052-0-34030";"This barrel smells sweet, but also … rotten. What could it be?"
"115740052-0-34031";"There you are! He's got her—he's got her!"
"115740052-0-34032";"Keep it down! What are you talking about?"
"115740052-0-34033";"Khasda! He and his bodyguard—the biggest I've ever seen! They cornered Tasnasi and took her back there! You have to save her!"
"115740052-0-34034";"You—you'll regret crossing Khasda!"
"115740052-0-34035";"He's getting away! Untie me!"
"115740052-0-34036";"After him!"
"115740052-0-34037";"Please. Tasnasi. Spare me!"
"115740052-0-34038";"Shut up, Khasda! One more word from your lying tongue and Tasnasi will claw it out."
"115740052-0-34039";"Tasnasi will only make this offer once. Confess to the Stitches for all you have done and she will not try out your torture devices for herself."
"115740052-0-34040";"Tasnasi … you win."
"115740052-0-34041";"Get up. All the Stitches will hear the truth from your lips before the day is done."
"115740052-0-34043";"Don't be stupid, Tasnasi. Name your price. Riches? Weapons? Skooma?"
"115740052-0-34044";"Tasnasi only wants one thing, of little value."
"115740052-0-34045";"Your life."
"115740052-0-34049";"Curse your meddling!"
"115740052-0-34050";"Kill this muskarse!"
"115740052-0-34051";"A moment, traveler. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-34059";"Take up one of our training swords and meet this one in the gardens."
"115740052-0-34060";"That's a weaponized model. You'll be able to destroy any animunculi that get in your way."
"115740052-0-34061";"I upgraded that one with a deploy-able barrier and speed booster. Protect the others while you're disabling the shock conveyors!"
"115740052-0-34062";"That's a restoration model. It can make repairs to any damaged skeevatons and carry a charge to overload the shock conveyors."
"115740052-0-34063";"Friend! They took us! They mean to eat us! I saw them take the key across the bridge. Please, find it and free us!"
"115740052-0-34064";"Who are you? Where is—."
"115740052-0-34065";"If you're so fascinated by the dead, why don't you join them?"
"115740052-0-34066";"The beast blocks our way. We must fight."
"115740052-0-34067";"This one will keep you healed! Moons preserve us."
"115740052-0-34068";"The beast departs. Quick, let us leave."
"115740052-0-34069";"Ah, the beautiful Banji! It is good to see you alive and well."
"115740052-0-34070";"Raz? At last, you have returned to me! Oh, I knew you would keep your promise!"
"115740052-0-34071";"Ah, yes. Raz is … keeping his promise. Of course."
"115740052-0-34072";"We need your cart to help barricade the city, Grishka. The Mane will compensate you for any damage."
"115740052-0-34073";"Raz? You're here?"
"115740052-0-34074";"Of course! You are safe now, sweet Nurra. Raz will get you to safety."
"115740052-0-34075";"The two of us behind the mill. Reminds me of old times. Old promises."
"115740052-0-34076";"Eh, let's talk about that later. Much later."
"115740052-0-34077";"The fragrant Pashroni! Raz is glad to see you safe."
"115740052-0-34078";"Hello, Raz. I didn't know you were back in Merryvale."
"115740052-0-34079";"Well, yes. Come, let Raz lead you to safety."
"115740052-0-34080";"Very well. But do not think you can just slip away again. We have much to talk about."
"115740052-0-34082";"I look forward to tasting hearty blood!"
"115740052-0-34083";"At least I tasted life …!"
"115740052-0-34086";"Euraxians? The wall has been breached!"
"115740052-0-34087";"Up there! More Euraxians!"
"115740052-0-34088";"Seeing is the problem, Haduras! That's why we need it!"
"115740052-0-34089";"Maybe we don't need it? This one's claws are sharp! Pop! Pop! And we're all saved!"
"115740052-0-34090";"No! It, uh, must be the fork! It won't work otherwise!"
"115740052-0-34091";"Brothers, sisters. Vazbi must speak about Silhu-jo's passing."
"115740052-0-34092";"Before he passed, this one learned the truth of the Stricken. Of the role we healers played in their suffering."
"115740052-0-34093";"No longer. In S'rendarr's name, we must go to Baan Dar's Litter. We must help the Stricken, and we must try to heal this age-old wound. For their sake, and for ours."
"115740052-0-34095";"Stay with me, old master."
"115740052-0-34096";"This is insanity, Grundwulf! Can't you see that these Hollowfangs spout nothing but hollow promises?"
"115740052-0-34097";"Dragons are here, Renald! The world will end in fire before your fabled Emperor comes! If you won't act, I will!"
"115740052-0-34099";"The Devourer has chosen, old bat! Do not trouble us again!"
"115740052-0-34101";"We all grieve for Hursh, Miniza."
"115740052-0-34102";"Five-claw, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-34104";"There. That abandoned Imperial ship is our way out of here. Let's put Garlas Malatar far behind us."
"115740052-0-34105";"Renald is slippery, but Nisaazda will catch him in time. You will not be so lucky."
"115740052-0-34106";"I'm glad those gates didn't keep you long."
"115740052-0-34107";"You think the Dragon imagery is significant, wizard?"
"115740052-0-34108";"Of course! Why else sculpt them on nearly every surface?"
"115740052-0-34109";"Maybe whoever lived here simply liked Dragons, yes?"
"115740052-0-34114";"You are not the skulking rat, but you are my prey all the same."
"115740052-0-34117";"Enjoying the festival, are we?"
"115740052-0-34118";"I recognize that tree! They're on their way to Riverhold! That's not good, not good at all."
"115740052-0-34119";"Ah, five-claw, good. I have another task for you."
"115740052-0-34120";"Nisaazda, they are coming!"
"115740052-0-34121";"I've had enough of wading through you leeches."
"115740052-0-34122";"The Dragon lies beneath that temple. I can smell its blood on the air. Push through!"
"115740052-0-34123";"That's far enough, old bat!"
"115740052-0-34124";"Out of my way, leech. I have more pressing concerns than ending your life."
"115740052-0-34125";"You took the words out of Nisaazda's mouth."
"115740052-0-34126";"This one won't have to."
"115740052-0-34127";"Quickly, take as much as you can carry."
"115740052-0-34129";"No more excuses, no more delays. Double your output or your reanimated body will march at the head of Euraxia's forces."
"115740052-0-34130";"You dare interrupt my work? I will rend your flesh from your bones!"
"115740052-0-34133";"Did you find proof that Peryite caused the flu in Orcrest? Unlock this cage, so we can spread his distasteful teachings!"
"115740052-0-34134";"We're ready. Let's get out of this city before it kills us."
"115740052-0-34135";"I'll meet you outside of the city! Peryite willing, we'll catch the flu on the way!"
"115740052-0-34139";"You hesitated, old bat."
"115740052-0-34141";"I didn't need your help."
"115740052-0-34142";"We have no more time for this. His allies are here."
"115740052-0-34146";"Mark this day. When I bleed this Dragon dry, the Empire will be made whole!"
"115740052-0-34147";"It's only fitting that you'll be defeated where so many of your soldiers are already buried."
"115740052-0-34148";"Do some damage, five-claw."
"115740052-0-34150";"Well done, five-claw. Let's talk over there."
"115740052-0-34151";"There is no place Darloc Brae would rather be than with his fallen soldiers."
"115740052-0-34152";"You'll regret coming to Rimmen Necropolis."
"115740052-0-34153";"We go where we please. And we bring death and destruction with us."
"115740052-0-34154";"We'll introduce you to them soon enough."
"115740052-0-34155";"Darloc Brae never feared death. And he certainly doesn't fear you."
"115740052-0-34156";"Darloc Brae supposes you would happily lose everything for your master."
"115740052-0-34157";"Death is only temporary."
"115740052-0-34159";"You're no threat to us."
"115740052-0-34160";"Our enemies always say that right before they die."
"115740052-0-34161";"We hone our skills so much in life, even death can't take them."
"115740052-0-34162";"The only way to prove it is to watch you die."
"115740052-0-34163";"If you kill my forces, I will simply command them to rise, and fight again."
"115740052-0-34164";"Then we will kill you first."
"115740052-0-34165";"They're definitely on their way, Khamira! Euraxians with perfectly aligned teeth!"
"115740052-0-34166";"Let's go! We can talk when we're outside of the city walls."
"115740052-0-34167";"Control Dragons? What folly! But what was that about killing the last Dragonguard?"
"115740052-0-34168";"I think you found everything I need to fill in the blanks. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-34169";"Captain Saulinia. That must be Captain S. And the Cygnus Irregulars are Imperial troops under the command of Prefect Calo at Sandswirl Manor."
"115740052-0-34170";"Old Khajiiti legends and rumors of a last Dragonguard? Intriguing."
"115740052-0-34171";"You know better than that, witch of Azurah."
"115740052-0-34172";"Let's resume our search."
"115740052-0-34175";"Meet Zamarak at the temple and maybe we can disrupt the spell."
"115740052-0-34177";"Mulaamnir. The vermin still pester us. Devour them."
"115740052-0-34178";"As you say, my brother."
"115740052-0-34183";"I can feel it! Haha—ah!"
"115740052-0-34184";"I failed you, old friend. You deserved a better death."
"115740052-0-34185";"No kind words for me, Renald?"
"115740052-0-34186";"Still your tongue, wyrm. Your death is the one good thing to come of this."
"115740052-0-34187";"I go knowing the war for freedom only brought you ruin."
"115740052-0-34188";"Void take you."
"115740052-0-34189";"My suffering ends here. Yours will linger long after."
"115740052-0-34191";"Keep running. It will do you no good. I will devour you!"
"115740052-0-34197";"Get me to that platform, Tharn. I can separate the Moons using the altars."
"115740052-0-34198";"Kaalgrontiid is absorbing Jode's Core! As long as the moons remain aligned, the power flowing through him is unimaginable!"
"115740052-0-34199";"You must deal with Mulaamnir, five-claw. I will divert whatever energy I can into the Dragonhorn, but use it sparingly."
"115740052-0-34201";"Tharn! Get me to the other altar, now!"
"115740052-0-34204";"The Dragonhorn is ready, five-claw!"
"115740052-0-34205";"You killed Mulaamnir. Good."
"115740052-0-34206";"The Moons. I need to finish the ritual."
"115740052-0-34207";"Jone and Jode, hear me!"
"115740052-0-34208";"The power, it belongs to me!"
"115740052-0-34209";"Separate and resume your eternal dance! Now, five-claw, sound the horn!"
"115740052-0-34210";"No! I will not … be denied!"
"115740052-0-34211";"You did it, Khamira. You ended the eclipse. But that means …."
"115740052-0-34212";"The Moon Gate has closed. We are trapped, yes—but Mulaamnir is dead and Kaalgrontiid has been defeated."
"115740052-0-34213";"Kaalgrontiid, I wonder …? I'm actually pleased to see you, Cadwell. Come, Khamira. Your people await their queen."
"115740052-0-34214";"Thank you, my friends. For everything."
"115740052-0-34215";"Our hero arrives! We owe you our lives, friend. More importantly, you've done a great service for Peryite."
"115740052-0-34216";"Though from the sound of things you had greater obstacles to overcome."
"115740052-0-34217";"There's a dangerous build up of steam! It's going to vent!"
"115740052-0-34218";"More of those rolling bombs! Keep your distance!"
"115740052-0-34219";"Blade traps! Watch out!"
"115740052-0-34220";"More dead? How did the intruder get past Dro'zakar?"
"115740052-0-34221";"There are many holes through which a rat can scurry here. Keep on guard."
"115740052-0-34222";"Now Muzzi will leave this place and never come back!"
"115740052-0-34223";"One of Calo's pet cats? Time to make me a fur coat!"
"115740052-0-34226";"You were always the stronger swordsman, Grundwulf, but not the better one."
"115740052-0-34227";"Mazza-Mirri? So, the fateful moment is upon us."
"115740052-0-34228";"It is, Shando."
"115740052-0-34229";"Damn you, Renald! We can end it all! The Empire can be reborn! Right here!"
"115740052-0-34230";"Whatever you become through this madness, it will not be Emperor."
"115740052-0-34231";"Then do it, Renald! I'd rather die with blade in hand, than go back to that honorless life of yours!"
"115740052-0-34232";"Brave Shando-ri will guide you now, child. But do not fear! Old Mazza-Mirri will be watching."
"115740052-0-34234";"What? Intruders!"
"115740052-0-34235";"Great! Another civilian with a death wish!"
"115740052-0-34241";"They'll see clear enough once the anchor's built! Haha!"
"115740052-0-34242";"The anchor will let you all see, as I do. All will become clear soon!"
"115740052-0-34243";"How good of you to join me. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-34246";"Keep the undead away, walker."
"115740052-0-34247";"We start in the temple garden, at the Pillar of the Spring Moon."
"115740052-0-34248";"You were so young. So young. I'm going to fix this, boy. I'm going to bring you back. I promise."
"115740052-0-34249";"I never intended—what did I do wrong? This isn't you, sweet boy! This isn't you!"
"115740052-0-34250";"Bringing you back to life is an imperfect solution, I know, but I am confident you'll get used to this … new beginning?"
"115740052-0-34252";"They're here! Get them for the Queen!"
"115740052-0-34253";"You're an honorable woman, Feina-Darak!"
"115740052-0-34255";"You deserve to lead this town!"
"115740052-0-34256";"I can fix this. I just need to paint a restraining ward to—"
"115740052-0-34257";"Witch of Azurah, where will we find the Dark Adept's orbs?"
"115740052-0-34258";"His corrupt stench billows out of the northern vault. But darkness gathers to the east and west, too."
"115740052-0-34259";"Then we strike east and west. Destroying those orbs should weaken Arum-Khal before our final attack."
"115740052-0-34260";"I can't risk approaching him while he remains at full strength. I'll do what I can from here. Azura guide you, my friends."
"115740052-0-34263";"Well done! Destroying the orbs diminished Arum-Khal's power, but I don't know for how long. You have to strike now!"
"115740052-0-34264";"Arum-Khal's fury clouds my vision. I need to get closer. Don't wait for me. Destroy him!"
"115740052-0-34265";"Queen Khamira, have you been injured?"
"115740052-0-34266";"I am fine, just tired. But look, the Moons are no longer aligned!"
"115740052-0-34267";"Tell me … tell me about the Dragons. The Euraxians. What is the state of our forces?"
"115740052-0-34268";"Fools! Servants of a false queen! You will scream for mercy when I—!"
"115740052-0-34269";"Our scouts tell us that most of the Euraxians and Dragons fled when the Moons parted. Our own troops have not returned, but the Mane has sent an envoy."
"115740052-0-34270";"An envoy from the Mane? Hmm. If you'll excuse me, I have other business to attend to."
"115740052-0-34271";"Quiet now. Time to serve your penance."
"115740052-0-34273";"No, no, no! Don't do that. Don't—"
"115740052-0-34274";"The reign of the Usurper Queen nears its end."
"115740052-0-34275";"Soon Rimmen and all of Anequina will once again belong to us!"
"115740052-0-34276";"On this I give you my word as the heir of Anequina, the daughter of King Hemakar, and the true queen of Rimmen!"
"115740052-0-34277";"All hail Khamira, daughter of King Hemakar and Queen Numara!"
"115740052-0-34278";"Moons guide you, sword-wielder. Moons guide …."
"115740052-0-34279";"There! They emerge!"
"115740052-0-34280";"No. I lost Shando-ri. I am sorry."
"115740052-0-34281";"You have nothing to apologize for. I trained Shando to face the Dark. He will find his way. I am certain of it."
"115740052-0-34284";"Ah! More faithful answer the roar of the First Cat! Come, come! Welcome!"
"115740052-0-34285";"It looks like someone else wants to die today."
"115740052-0-34286";"Mortals are always fascinated with death. You should understand that better than most."
"115740052-0-34287";"Darloc Brae understands seeking out a challenge. But only if it's possible to emerge victorious."
"115740052-0-34288";"Very well, warriors. We will see how you fare against the greatest warriors Tamriel has ever known."
"115740052-0-34289";"It's time I showed these fools the depth of Daedric power."
"115740052-0-34290";"Impressive, mortals. But do you honestly think you can defeat the chosen one of the prince Himself?"
"115740052-0-34291";"A fine fight, but now witness how war is waged."
"115740052-0-34292";"How could Darloc Brae's army be defeated?"
"115740052-0-34293";"Leave while you still can, mortals."
"115740052-0-34294";"Do you honestly believe you can defeat us?"
"115740052-0-34295";"Your warriors are nothing but rotting bones waiting to be crushed to dust by my forces."
"115740052-0-34296";"Our prince will be pleased when we fill this arena with your screams."
"115740052-0-34297";"Not bad, but now watch a true warrior fight."
"115740052-0-34298";"There was a time when Darloc Brae could have taught you to become legends. That time has passed."
"115740052-0-34299";"It cannot end this way, Darloc. Together, we can teach these mortals the meaning of death."
"115740052-0-34300";"My prince! Remake us! Please!"
"115740052-0-34302";"More have come to serve. Good. Kneel before your god and I will give you purpose."
"115740052-0-34303";"Faithless. Put them in their place, then put them to work."
"115740052-0-34304";"Know your place!"
"115740052-0-34305";"What is the commotion? I'll have peace in our god's house!"
"115740052-0-34306";"Alkosh have mercy! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-34307";"What are you talking about? We should be grateful to serve the Divine!"
"115740052-0-34308";"Azin-jo! You liar! You said Alkosh was here to save us, but he turned us into slaves!"
"115740052-0-34309";"Abnur, you simply must stay for the ceremony. It's not every day we get to see a lovely cat receive a crown!"
"115740052-0-34310";"Nonsense. And don't call me Abnur. Besides, I think I've overstayed my welcome as far as Khamira is concerned."
"115740052-0-34313";"Strike Ma'jha-dro, quickly now!"
"115740052-0-34314";"Now, block this one's attack!"
"115740052-0-34315";"Quick! Strike while this one is off balance!"
"115740052-0-34316";"Now bash Ma'jha-dro before he strikes!"
"115740052-0-34317";"Again! Press your advantage with a heavy attack."
"115740052-0-34319";"Blasphemers! You spilled the blood of Alkosh's faithful and desecrated his temple. I should have seen you were bent cats!"
"115740052-0-34320";"You old fool! There are no gods here! Only tyrants!"
"115740052-0-34321";"They see through your false god. They will free us."
"115740052-0-34322";"I assure you, Cashia, my wounds are healing quite nicely."
"115740052-0-34323";"Nevertheless, this one has asked the outlander to stand beside Khamira … should I decide to give the Mane's blessing."
"115740052-0-34324";"This is the place for Jora-ri to rest. I have never been more certain of anything in my entire death."
"115740052-0-34325";"Jora-ri hopes that Saviwa is a little bothered by the fact that he missed out on our royal treasure."
"115740052-0-34326";"You will not advance!"
"115740052-0-34327";"I will, as her guardian all these years and as the Speaker of the Mane. Khamira is the rightful heir."
"115740052-0-34328";"Now break free of this one's trap!"
"115740052-0-34329";"Hmm. I'm willing to bet those tablets would fit rather nicely into these sockets on the floor."
"115740052-0-34331";"Finally, there is one I wish to honor. One whose assistance in these matters was unprecedented and invaluable."
"115740052-0-34332";"Five-claw, my comrade and friend, please … approach the throne."
"115740052-0-34333";"Well, that certainly wasn't right. Care to try again?"
"115740052-0-34334";"Watch as Nala-do becomes a sleek Euraxian soldier."
"115740052-0-34335";"Gah! How do they see with this thing on?"
"115740052-0-34336";"Gharesh-ri has been spotted in the market. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-34337";"Finally, some action!"
"115740052-0-34338";"And all hail five-claw, whom I name Champion of Anequina!"
"115740052-0-34339";"I'll return to Rimmen, plead Calo's case, and send someone to help you. Meanwhile, I suggest you start your search for the shrine at the Stitches."
"115740052-0-34340";"Hey there, good looking."
"115740052-0-34341";"Talk soon!"
"115740052-0-34344";"Wait. That body. It's one of the assassins. They must have passed this way."
"115740052-0-34345";"Jakarn! Get back here, you sneaky—Kra!"
"115740052-0-34346";"Nala-do will deal with the soldier. This one can't wait to get out of this dungy armor!"
"115740052-0-34347";"The south platform is under attack!"
"115740052-0-34348";"Stupid cats!"
"115740052-0-34349";"Wait, I better warn my lieutenant first."
"115740052-0-34350";"More bodies. The hired guides. Saulinia's work, Zamarak thinks."
"115740052-0-34351";"Go. Destroy the siege weapons. Nala-do will clean up this mess."
"115740052-0-34353";"Dearest, come look at this! A stranger found my rotmeth keg on the side of the road. Can you believe it?"
"115740052-0-34354";"And it should be nice and fermented by now. You can finally test it!"
"115740052-0-34355";"Well? How does it taste?"
"115740052-0-34356";"Oh, so close! Better luck next time, friend."
"115740052-0-34357";"All right, cats and kittens, like my uncle Edmund always says, best walk while you're ahead. You have yourselves a great night, eh?"
"115740052-0-34358";"Oh, not so soon, pink-skin. You have yet to play Daibiza."
"115740052-0-34359";"Look, it's been a real pleasure playing with you, but I've got a friend waiting on me. How about we pick things up tomorrow? Double or nothing."
"115740052-0-34360";"Well, you will at least let Daibiza and Cherjhad walk you home, yes? The streets of Rimmen are no place for a lone Breton with heavy pockets."
"115740052-0-34361";"You know, that's a generous offer, and I'm truly flattered, but you really don't need to worry. I'm spry as a cricket. Pockets light, pockets heavy, whatever."
"115740052-0-34362";"Enough. Sit. Now. Do not take us for fools, Jakarn."
"115740052-0-34363";"Wicked pawns of Lorkhaj! Is there remorse in your mortal heart, bent one, that you choose to walk the Way of Jode?"
"115740052-0-34364";"You cheating shaveskin! Get him. Get him!"
"115740052-0-34365";"Scour the city! Find that swaggering muskarse!"
"115740052-0-34366";"So be it. Step into the fire and be redeemed!"
"115740052-0-34367";"Five-claw! This way!"
"115740052-0-34368";"Those words … this must be where the Dragonguard once trained."
"115740052-0-34369";"The Dragonguard … they sound like the adepts of the Desert Wind."
"115740052-0-34370";"The Dragonguard … honor the Dragons? Curious."
"115740052-0-34371";"Fear as an advantage? This one never thought to exploit the Dragons' fearlessness."
"115740052-0-34372";"These words … Zamarak thinks the Dragonguard were built on contradictions."
"115740052-0-34373";"Chief! That's the one from Rimmen! The one that deals with Jakarn."
"115740052-0-34374";"Barely queen for a day and already she's giving orders."
"115740052-0-34375";"Foul marauders of Lorkhaj! You will not walk the Way of Jone unscathed!"
"115740052-0-34376";"You yet live! And the little lattice is dispelled!"
"115740052-0-34377";"What powers are at work that you can defy the will of the Moons and win?"
"115740052-0-34379";"Nala-do will guard the rear. You go ahead and find a way into the palace."
"115740052-0-34380";"You are tearing the wound wider! Why?"
"115740052-0-34381";"I'm warning you! If you dare profane holy Alkosh's chancel, you will be damned beyond all damnation!"
"115740052-0-34382";"Great Alkosh! Do not forsake us! I beg—"
"115740052-0-34383";"What an ugly thing! How could this one not see it for what it was?"
"115740052-0-34384";"It was a beautiful mirage …."
"115740052-0-34385";"The thirsty desert walker sees what they want to see."
"115740052-0-34386";"Only to the blind. Do you see my scars now?"
"115740052-0-34387";"Forgive this one. His eyes are open now."
"115740052-0-34388";"I refuse to die … near that assassin …."
"115740052-0-34389";"Oh, good. More blood to spill."
"115740052-0-34390";"Tangle's on the other side of the Scar. See you there, good looking!"
"115740052-0-34391";"Maybe now the royal family can rest in peace."
"115740052-0-34392";"Euraxia not only murdered our king and queen, she desecrated their graves? She's a monster!"
"115740052-0-34393";"There you are. Any questions before we leap into this slippery hedge maze?"
"115740052-0-34394";"We need to find the way into the palace—and quickly!"
"115740052-0-34395";"There he is! Boy, this is … creative."
"115740052-0-34396";"I'll keep watch here, in case any guards wander by. You see if you can find the key he's talking about. Deal?"
"115740052-0-34397";"May Khenarthi guide you to the Sands Behind the Stars."
"115740052-0-34398";"Below … that looks like Prefect Calo. What is he doing here?"
"115740052-0-34399";"Free at last! Thank you, both! Now, all this key-finding and trap-disarming is hard work, yes?"
"115740052-0-34400";"You've earned a rest, I think."
"115740052-0-34401";"Are these the remains of the Dragonguard?"
"115740052-0-34402";"Such a small thing when compared to the Dragons. Still, we should take it to Rimmen, yes?"
"115740052-0-34403";"I want to take another look at these books. We'll meet you back in Rimmen."
"115740052-0-34404";"See, Fez? There's our friend, right on time."
"115740052-0-34405";"Oh, you two-faced little—"
"115740052-0-34406";"Zamarak will linger as well … to make sure the Imperials find their way back."
"115740052-0-34407";"Steady hands, friend. I'll just be right over here."
"115740052-0-34408";"See you there, good looking."
"115740052-0-34409";"Oh, look! More cats! I do adore flaying and then roasting the nasty creatures!"
"115740052-0-34410";"I'm of two minds. I want to watch your cadavers tear these cheeky mudcrabs apart, but I also want to deal with my inferior duplicate. What to do, what to do?"
"115740052-0-34411";"This relates to the legends of Khunzar-ri and Queen Anequina, yes?"
"115740052-0-34412";"The Cygnus Irregulars assisted, but your agent did the important work."
"115740052-0-34414";"A weapon from the Dragonguard? Interesting. Come, five-claw. I want to hear your report."
"115740052-0-34415";"Pardon the interruption, Queen Khamira, but that sounds like the Dragonhorn we found."
"115740052-0-34416";"We will transfer your duplicate's animus into you, Head. But our time with Queen Euraxia has reached its end. Come along."
"115740052-0-34417";"Get back! You will not take the jewel from Fez'skar! It's mine!"
"115740052-0-34418";"Listen to me, Fez. That jewel's made you crazy! No one can make that jump!"
"115740052-0-34419";"You lie! Baan Dar smiles on me, Jakarn! Riches! Glory! All will belong to Fez'skar!"
"115740052-0-34420";"Fez, damn it, don't do this! Stop!"
"115740052-0-34421";"Fez!"
"115740052-0-34422";"Gods damn it, Fez, you idiot. Why did—wait. It's not that far."
"115740052-0-34423";"I really need a drink. You need a drink, right? I need a drink. Meet me at the Goiter's Gulp, would you? We'll settle up there."
"115740052-0-34424";"Don't worry. I'm not going to jump. I just need to clear my head and say goodbye to a friend."
"115740052-0-34425";"Fez, you stupid, stupid cat. I'm going to miss your mangy hide."
"115740052-0-34427";"Well look at this, Ak'an. It's just who were waiting for."
"115740052-0-34428";"Let's find out, shall we? Hello, Jakarn."
"115740052-0-34429";"So, here we are, Tu'heiba. Ready to clear the air, or should I start throwing stuff?"
"115740052-0-34430";"Peace, Jakarn. All I want is the gem. Now, I will ask you this one last time. Where is the Jewel of Baan Dar?"
"115740052-0-34431";"I'll take you to it. Just promise me you'll feed it to your cat, or toss it in a vault, or something."
"115740052-0-34432";"You have my word."
"115740052-0-34433";"Look at us, making nice. This calls for a toast! Suggestions?"
"115740052-0-34434";"To bold, foolish Fez'skar, I think. A Khajiit who died as he lived."
"115740052-0-34435";"Ha. Yeah. To Fez."
"115740052-0-34440";"The skies warn of a changing season. Can you see it?"
"115740052-0-34445";"Are the people of Rimmen cowards?"
"115740052-0-34446";"They're just afraid, Khamira. Remember, the Dragons still darken the skies overhead."
"115740052-0-34447";"But we need to replenish our forces. I fear there are more battles ahead."
"115740052-0-34448";"You carry the weight of the kingdom, Khamira, but the crown is not yet yours."
"115740052-0-34449";"Yes, yes. I must be recognized by the Mane and Queen Ayrenn. Which reminds me, has the Dominion sent us any aid?"
"115740052-0-34450";"A few advisors, some gold. But no troops. We are on our own."
"115740052-0-34451";"Books and scrolls! I knew it! Knowledge is power, my friend, you'll see!"
"115740052-0-34453";"I never liked you, Abnur. Now do me a favor and just die!"
"115740052-0-34455";"As long as the necromantic spell remains in place, the dead will keep rising."
"115740052-0-34456";"Door's locked, eh? Damn. Maybe Marmalade can fit through the crack, there."
"115740052-0-34457";"Off with you, Sugar-Belly! Now, another locked door, eh? I bet Marmalade could nick a key off that drunken guard."
"115740052-0-34458";"The shield is down!"
"115740052-0-34459";"We … we can mourn Nala-do later. I … I need to see the throne."
"115740052-0-34460";"Honeydew! Bit high up, though. Maybe Marmalade can unlock it for us."
"115740052-0-34461";"Is this a lesson? If so, Zamarak is not sure what he learned."
"115740052-0-34462";"Fight without honor … Zamarak thought Dragonguard were great warriors."
"115740052-0-34463";"They do not trust anyone. Hmm …."
"115740052-0-34464";"To fight a Dragon face to face, the Dragonguard knew that was folly."
"115740052-0-34465";"Soul and mind falter? Is that what happened to their order?"
"115740052-0-34466";"How true. A Dragon's voice does more harm than its claws or teeth."
"115740052-0-34467";"Peace? Do they speak of peace with Dragons or something else?"
"115740052-0-34469";"The way out, finally. I can't abide another moment in this stench."
"115740052-0-34472";"How dare you intrude upon my oasis? Leave this place! Now!"
"115740052-0-34473";"That's all of them! Meet you back at the ranch, hero!"
"115740052-0-34474";"Haha! You've done it! Down with the Dragons!"
"115740052-0-34475";"Merciful Alkosh! How is that possible?"
"115740052-0-34476";"Because they are not gods! And we will no longer be their slaves!"
"115740052-0-34477";"You have something else to do? Very well. Zamarak will wait for you to return."
"115740052-0-34478";"Here you are, traveler-friend. Let us hope this potion has the desired effect."
"115740052-0-34479";"I'll skin you alive!"
"115740052-0-34482";"Blaming Abnur Tharn will not end the Dragon infestation, Khamira."
"115740052-0-34483";"Ever the voice of reason, Speaker. Ah, here comes someone who can help us now."
"115740052-0-34484";"The Dragon returns! Take cover!"
"115740052-0-34485";"Get down! I'll deal with this!"
"115740052-0-34486";"Bizarre visions, dismembered bodies … I hate necromancy! Cadwell trusts you, five-claw. You talk to him."
"115740052-0-34487";"I'm off to put a stop to these dastardly villains!"
"115740052-0-34488";"We don't have a choice, Izanji!"
"115740052-0-34489";"And what, you expect us to just stroll into an Akaviri crypt? Be reasonable."
"115740052-0-34490";"Well, if we don't recover those mural pieces, who will?"
"115740052-0-34491";"Tharn! Can you determine where Cadwell disappeared to?"
"115740052-0-34492";"Hmm? Ah, you've returned. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-34493";"Our neighbors saw nothing, of course. Oh! You've found one of the pieces!"
"115740052-0-34495";"Cadwell? What happened to you?"
"115740052-0-34496";"Ah, good old Abnur. The nastier he treats you, the more you know he loves you."
"115740052-0-34498";"I'll delay Zumog Phoom's ritual as long as I can. You take Cadwell and see if you can recover his stolen energy."
"115740052-0-34501";"Stop! What are you doing, Zaorir?"
"115740052-0-34502";"We appreciate your patience, good lords and ladies. The viewing will begin in but a few short moments."
"115740052-0-34503";"The House of Histories is proud to reveal the Rithana-di-Renada! Please, step forward for a better look."
"115740052-0-34504";"This mural was created as a symbol of peace, many centuries ago. Sixteen kingdoms, yes, but one mural, one song, one people living in harmony."
"115740052-0-34505";"In this time of turmoil, it is our hope that the Rithana-di-Renada will inspire a renewed commitment to unity and peace."
"115740052-0-34506";"No! I won't allow you to interfere with the ritual!"
"115740052-0-34507";"I will flay the flesh from your bones!"
"115740052-0-34508";"That glowing cloud … it's holding this ritual together!"
"115740052-0-34510";"Praying to the moons won't save you, cat!"
"115740052-0-34511";"Zamarak failed … again."
"115740052-0-34512";"Those were fresh sugar claws! I didn't even see who ran into me."
"115740052-0-34513";"We must follow the jelly trail! Quick!"
"115740052-0-34514";"Your past will destroy you, Abnur Tharn!"
"115740052-0-34515";"Get rid of … that damned cloud!"
"115740052-0-34516";"Well, that was rather … alarming."
"115740052-0-34517";"There! Rideza must have stepped on the jelly from the sugar claws. You must follow her trail while this one alerts the guards."
"115740052-0-34518";"Huh. Looks like I'll need to tweak the recipe a bit."
"115740052-0-34519";"Oh, look at that. Must have fallen right off the wagon. How lucky someone found it."
"115740052-0-34520";"Of course! Let me just … drink this … oh, so delicious brew."
"115740052-0-34521";"Why did you have to come? Why did you make me like this?"
"115740052-0-34522";"Why are you singing to my house cat, Luna?"
"115740052-0-34523";"No! I won't let anyone corrupt this oasis! Not again!"
"115740052-0-34524";"Why couldn't you leave me be? Monsters! Defilers!"
"115740052-0-34525";"I just wanted to heal them. Why … why couldn't I heal them?"
"115740052-0-34527";"Lady Izza? Rigurt has a logical explanation! You have great influence with the Khajiit, so Rigurt wanted to impress you with a song. But first he had to practice. On your cat. Because is like a tiny you."
"115740052-0-34528";"It's difficult to imagine anything sadder than a confused Nord clutching a lute."
"115740052-0-34529";"This song is dedicated to Rigurt's favorite diplomatic assistant! And Lady Izza! And that house cat! And increased peace between the Nords and Khajiit! Oh yeah, and mead!"
"115740052-0-34530";"Lady Izza will do her best to make peace between the Nords and Khajiit, just so you can make your way back to Skyrim."
"115740052-0-34532";"Oh, your eyes shine like glowing mushrooms in Gloomreach! And you're sturdy as a mountain goat's hoofed feet! We should meet to drink mead and eat wolf meat!"
"115740052-0-34535";"Interloper! Just more fuel for the ritual!"
"115740052-0-34536";"Canonreeve Juz-do of Alabaster, I am Rigurt of Windhelm! On behalf of the Skald-King, I present you with a gift of peace from the Nords to bring our cultures closer!"
"115740052-0-34537";"Is your gift rancid cabbage? Because it smells like rancid cabbage."
"115740052-0-34538";"Not at all! Rigurt brought our finest snowy sabre cat coats! Although, they may have been stored near cabbage. And the cabbage may have gone bad."
"115740052-0-34539";"Your gift is clothes made from slaughtered cats? This isn't a peace offering, it is a war crime!"
"115740052-0-34540";"These are the finest coats in all of Windhelm. Who wouldn't want to be wrapped in our warm and luscious … cat skins?"
"115740052-0-34541";"Tell your Skald-King that if he wants our war to continue, Queen Ayrenn will be happy to oblige."
"115740052-0-34542";"Rigurt's message will be heard by Queen Ayrenn, leader of the Aldmeri Dominion? Rigurt feels so important!"
"115740052-0-34543";"You corrupted me. Changed me. And now … now I am this."
"115740052-0-34544";"It's an honor to meet you, Asaldak. On behalf of Jorunn Skald-King, please enjoy Windhelm's famous sweetbread!"
"115740052-0-34545";"Did you bring the bread with you from Skyrim? It's hard as a rock."
"115740052-0-34546";"Harder than a rock! Rigurt made some improvisations to the original recipe."
"115740052-0-34547";"Hmm, it doesn't smell too wretched. Asaldak will attempt to take a bite without breaking a tooth."
"115740052-0-34548";"What do you think? Impressive? Delicious? Ferocious?"
"115740052-0-34549";"Atrocious! Why is it filled with flowers? Why are the flowers covered in dirt? Why are there insects in the dirt?"
"115740052-0-34550";"How did you make something so terrible?"
"115740052-0-34551";"The false Alkosh roosts in the chancel, but you won't reach it until the Dragons of fire and ice are slain. The stairs will lead you to them."
"115740052-0-34552";"Wait, walker. Zamarak will accompany you."
"115740052-0-34553";"Looking for something? Rajhin is here to help."
"115740052-0-34554";"Rajhin! It's—it's actually the Shadow of Rajhin! Iraya, look."
"115740052-0-34555";"I see him. Stop messing with my museum, you muskarse!"
"115740052-0-34556";"You were right, five-claw. They are searching."
"115740052-0-34559";"That's good to hear."
"115740052-0-34560";"Iokkas, were you able to find your mother's research notes?"
"115740052-0-34561";"I … yes. Our traveler-friend was able to collect them."
"115740052-0-34562";"And what did they say? What happened to Cicatrice?"
"115740052-0-34563";"Let us speak of that after you've recovered. For now, you need to rest."
"115740052-0-34567";"Don't resist! Alkosh will punish you!"
"115740052-0-34568";"Fool! This is our chance for freedom!"
"115740052-0-34569";"If there is more to this ancient temple, I do not see a way to access it."
"115740052-0-34571";"Daal Tiid Zaam!"
"115740052-0-34572";"You—you are no Divine!"
"115740052-0-34573";"To restore the natural order. To reclaim all that was and will be. To correct the mortal mistake."
"115740052-0-34574";"I will remind you: Dragons are gods in the flesh."
"115740052-0-34575";"Go then, and feel your courage freeze under the pitiless gaze of Jone!"
"115740052-0-34576";"The Betrayer's scent. He came this way."
"115740052-0-34577";"That relic …. See what you can make of it, five-claw."
"115740052-0-34578";"The spirits awaken! The temple recognized me! I … I am becoming attuned!"
"115740052-0-34580";"No! You can't find out!"
"115740052-0-34581";"Another temple relic. Activate it for me, five-claw."
"115740052-0-34582";"The final temple relic, there it is! Activate it, please."
"115740052-0-34583";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-34584";"Now, five-claw, we need to reach the temple sanctuary."
"115740052-0-34585";"Everyone …. Thank you. Thank you so much."
"115740052-0-34586";"The magnate left a letter on her desk. Interesting, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-34587";"Well done! Let's keep moving."
"115740052-0-34588";"Hold on, Lavender. We'll get you out!"
"115740052-0-34589";"She'll find her way home. We have more work to do."
"115740052-0-34590";"Milksop! He's alive! Let's set him loose!"
"115740052-0-34591";"Best if we split up and go our separate ways."
"115740052-0-34592";"The dro-m'Athra approach, child. Will you dance to the song of the Dark? Or will you close your ears and fight?"
"115740052-0-34593";"This is ridiculous, piling up carts and boxes."
"115740052-0-34594";"Complaining doesn't help. We must all do our part."
"115740052-0-34595";"We should have just built a damn wall after we liberated the city the first time!"
"115740052-0-34596";"Something is wrong. I cannot stop the eclipse!"
"115740052-0-34597";"The fastest way to reach the farm is through the gate in the western wall."
"115740052-0-34598";"Everything … Khunzar-ri, Anequina, Cadwell, Jone and Jode. All of it … into the Dragonhorn."
"115740052-0-34599";"Stay back!"
"115740052-0-34600";"Follow me to all of the cheese-laden madness a mortal mind can handle!"
"115740052-0-34601";"Oh! Welcome back."
"115740052-0-34602";"A witch of Azurah? Hmm. You bring worthy allies to this battle, sword-wielder."
"115740052-0-34603";"And you've made a new friend, I see. Excellent."
"115740052-0-34604";"Well done, child. Well done. Come. The sword is just ahead."
"115740052-0-34605";"The Gorger of Glenumbra returns! Feast your eyes upon his rippling musculature, before he regains his appetites and feasts upon us all!"
"115740052-0-34606";"Fresh meat? Hircine take you!"
"115740052-0-34607";"Lost? Good. I could use a fresh skin!"
"115740052-0-34608";"The prey comes to me? Ha! Too easy!"
"115740052-0-34609";"You took your time. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-34610";"For Queen Euraxia!"
"115740052-0-34611";"The Hidden Moon Temple stands at the very center of the Ashen Scar. The adepts who lived there vanished centuries ago, but the air still crackles with arcane energy. Necromantic energy."
"115740052-0-34612";"But there's more. A malice that— By Azura, that sound!"
"115740052-0-34613";"Wait, my friend. Wait!"
"115740052-0-34614";"The orb! Destroy it! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-34615";"Your pathetic magics are useless here, witch of Azurah."
"115740052-0-34616";"Flee while you can. The hour of my return has come."
"115740052-0-34617";"Feel the cold touch of lingering death!"
"115740052-0-34618";"Already? But you only just arrived."
"115740052-0-34619";"Well, Raz could stay for one last meal before he departs."
"115740052-0-34620";"And letters? Will you write us letters?"
"115740052-0-34621";"Doesn't Raz always?"
"115740052-0-34622";"You feel that? That's the power of a true Daedric artifact, my friend! By the way, I forgot to mention that if you don't feed Volendrung souls, it will feed on yours."
"115740052-0-34623";"In a real war, you might have to hold Volendrung until it eats your soul, but you don't need to do that here. Unless you really want to."
"115740052-0-34624";"Argh! What's happening …?"
"115740052-0-34625";"I must admit, I was sort of hoping you'd submit to Volendrung. It's been so long since I watched a hammer eat someone."
"115740052-0-34626";"You killed until you died. They call that the oval of life. Or something."
"115740052-0-34627";"Gah! What in the Moons?"
"115740052-0-34628";"You left us to die, Calo!"
"115740052-0-34629";"Our blood is on your hands!"
"115740052-0-34630";"There you go, trying to play with my toys again. Well, I've had enough sharing!"
"115740052-0-34631";"You were never strong enough, Zamarak. I died because you were weak."
"115740052-0-34632";"You're a senile old fool, half-brother. How could you be so reckless? The Dragons are your fault!"
"115740052-0-34633";"I'll destroy you all!"
"115740052-0-34634";"Please, Sir Cadwell! You're part of Khunzar-ri's Kra'jun. Why are you doing this?"
"115740052-0-34635";"I want what Khunzar-ri hid away, and I need to move the moons to reach it. If a few cats must die along the way, what of it?"
"115740052-0-34636";"You're … you're insane!"
"115740052-0-34637";"You talk to your new god like that? Manners!"
"115740052-0-34638";"It's almost a shame how Anequina's faithful keep throwing themselves at my blade. Almost."
"115740052-0-34639";"Well, what do you know! A customer!"
"115740052-0-34640";"I will not fall! Not to the likes of you."
"115740052-0-34641";"Gut them, quick!"
"115740052-0-34642";"Get your tails out here!"
"115740052-0-34643";"Get out here, you cowards! Defend your leader!"
"115740052-0-34645";"I understand. Moving the Moons causes an eclipse. That opens the way to Jode's Core!"
"115740052-0-34646";"No, please! I taste of swill and skooma! I swear!"
"115740052-0-34647";"Wait, my friend. Let us talk before we confront the Betrayer."
"115740052-0-34648";"Watch out! There's more!"
"115740052-0-34649";"More of them! Don't get eaten!"
"115740052-0-34650";"Merciful Moons. I think that's the last of them."
"115740052-0-34652";"Ah, you've arrived. I sense there's a great deal to uncover here."
"115740052-0-34654";"Hmm. Some kind of Khajiiti children's tale?"
"115740052-0-34655";"Very well. Who is this youth who travels with you, I wonder? Come, child. Let old Mazza-Mirri have a look at you."
"115740052-0-34656";"Greetings, spirit. We've come in good faith."
"115740052-0-34657";"So, the adepts charged themselves with defending the liminal border between this world and Oblivion—the Lunar Lattice, as they saw it. Gatekeepers, of a sort. Intriguing."
"115740052-0-34658";"So, the adepts acted as soul shepherds? Ushering true souls to paradise, and bent souls to this Great Darkness. Hmm. Quite a task."
"115740052-0-34659";"I see. The Hidden Moon adepts practiced a form of necromancy here, pressing the souls of their corrupted kin into service so that they might be redeemed. Fascinating."
"115740052-0-34660";"Come now, wanderer. If you are not afraid. I have more to show you."
"115740052-0-34661";"We may have a problem. This gate won't budge. Speak to Shando-ri, would you?"
"115740052-0-34662";"Well done, sword-wielder. Come, we have little time!"
"115740052-0-34663";"You must not, Witch. Arum-Khal was his realm. Now it collapses."
"115740052-0-34664";"No. I can find them!"
"115740052-0-34665";"There. A portal!"
"115740052-0-34666";"We haven't much time! Reach for me!"
"115740052-0-34667";"Do not worry for me, friend. Go!"
"115740052-0-34668";"Shando … he will not make it."
"115740052-0-34669";"Don't despair. I won't abandon them!"
"115740052-0-34670";"Yes, brother. It's time to go home."
"115740052-0-34671";"It's so dark. I can't …."
"115740052-0-34672";"Come. I will show you the way."
"115740052-0-34673";"You can still catch him if you act quickly!"
"115740052-0-34674";"Finally, I am avenged."
"115740052-0-34675";"Out you go. Before Haskill sees the mess you've made. Neither of us wants to hear that."
"115740052-0-34676";"An eclipse is an eerie sight, but where are the Dragons?"
"115740052-0-34678";"It appears everyone has arrived. Report to Prefect Calo, five-claw, while I confer with the queen."
"115740052-0-34679";"I saw you, traveler! Why do all outsiders insist on acting suspiciously?"
"115740052-0-34680";"The Dragonhorn, five-claw! Do you have it? Use it, quick, quick!"
"115740052-0-34681";"This one should have jumped! Why didn't she? She was to be saved!"
"115740052-0-34682";"Shh, shh. You were wiser not to follow Sizenza. Those who did were the only ones to suffer."
"115740052-0-34684";"No, Asazeh! Never touch a Daedric monster. Especially a dead one!"
"115740052-0-34685";"Don't be such a nervous netch. The dead can't hurt us. But where do you think it came from?"
"115740052-0-34686";"It stinks of Coldharbour. Perhaps one of the Usurper Queen's lackeys summoned it, yes?"
"115740052-0-34687";"Dragons! Go join Queen Khamira! I'll take charge down here!"
"115740052-0-34688";"Get those fires out and ready the ballistae! Move it, soldiers!"
"115740052-0-34691";"Come brothers and sisters! Feast!"
"115740052-0-34692";"You've got some fight in you, but I heart your heart racing!"
"115740052-0-34693";"I'll bleed you for ten times every drop you spill!"
"115740052-0-34694";"You'll do no such thing."
"115740052-0-34696";"The path is clear. We need to reach Queen Khamira!"
"115740052-0-34697";"Gron Gol Zaam!"
"115740052-0-34707";"What?"
"115740052-0-34708";"Surprise!"
"115740052-0-34709";"I do enjoy cutting blackguards down to size! Tally-ho!"
"115740052-0-34710";"Hmm. Maybe I should have forked left instead of right? Let's try that again."
"115740052-0-34711";"To give into despair, this is easy. Let us instead find strength in hope. Jone and Jode will one day shine on Star Haven again. This, we must continue to believe."
"115740052-0-34712";"I've got these hooligans, old trout!"
"115740052-0-34713";"Let's get to Abnur before the moons completely align."
"115740052-0-34714";"What in Oblivion—?"
"115740052-0-34715";"I die with my pride!"
"115740052-0-34716";"Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?"
"115740052-0-34717";"This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold."
"115740052-0-34718";"Well done! Now you're ready to kill all sorts of idiots! I already went ahead and summoned some for you! Charge!"
"115740052-0-34719";"Well done! Now bring that hammer back before it gets hungry."
"115740052-0-34720";"There's Volendrung! Take it! Touch it! Love it!"
"115740052-0-34721";"Rarrrghh!"
"115740052-0-34722";"Red. The color of fiery passion and boiling blood!"
"115740052-0-34723";"Blue. The color of calm, measured inevitability, and despair."
"115740052-0-34724";"Purple. The color of regality, and savage gashes in the night sky."
"115740052-0-34725";"Spread out! Search the area and kill anyone who gets in our way."
"115740052-0-34726";"Through the portal, both of you! And bring the Dragonhorn!"
"115740052-0-34727";"Khamira, wait!"
"115740052-0-34728";"The Moon-Priests still guard this sacred place."
"115740052-0-34729";"The Moon-Priests worship new gods now, you insignificant morsels!"
"115740052-0-34730";"Avoid Mulaamnir as best you can!"
"115740052-0-34731";"You dare challenge Mulaamnir?"
"115740052-0-34732";"Pathetic creatures."
"115740052-0-34733";"Jode's Core is close. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-34734";"Go no farther, vermin!"
"115740052-0-34735";"Mulaamnir, Kaalgrontiid, and Jode's Core. Are you ready for this, Khamira?"
"115740052-0-34736";"Far enough, little insects."
"115740052-0-34737";"We did it! The necromancer has fallen!"
"115740052-0-34738";"Time for reckless audacity and derring-do!"
"115740052-0-34739";"Now, five-claw! Use the ballista and drive the Dragon to the ground!"
"115740052-0-34741";"We need to send your Cygnus Irregulars to the Moon Gate, Prefect Calo."
"115740052-0-34742";"Agreed. We've been practicing in anticipation of joining forces for more than a year."
"115740052-0-34743";"A year? But a year ago, we were still enemies."
"115740052-0-34744";"Perhaps, but I always knew we'd wind up fighting the Euraxians side-by-side some day."
"115740052-0-34745";"Rajhin was there when the city was still Rim'kha, before the influence of Men. To steal a city, this is easy. To take its name? Not even this one could accomplish such a feat."
"115740052-0-34746";"Ah, Rawla-Kei. A land of fertile valleys and grand hills. But enough about Rajhin's past romances, yes?"
"115740052-0-34747";"Dunei still has a shrine to Lorkhaj, yes? This is good. It is always wise for the Khajiit to revere the first trickster."
"115740052-0-34748";"The do-radhin of Verkarth were some of the most skillful warriors of their time. And Rajhin would know, for he ended up on the wrong side of their blades more than once."
"115740052-0-34749";"Meirvale, a land of heavy drinks and heavier regrets. Almost makes Rajhin miss his days as a mortal. The hangovers, however? Those, he is happy to do without."
"115740052-0-34750";"Pa'alatiin, kingdom of fat priests and wealthy merchants. A survivor of plagues and wars, and only stronger for it. Rajhin wonders if the kingdom will ever truly fall."
"115740052-0-34751";"Al'basti, kingdom of artistry. Rajhin studied there as a painter for one single day. This may or may not have something to do with a rather pretty subject with rather little clothing."
"115740052-0-34752";"Many Khajiit are skillful merchants, but none quite so clever as the river-traders of Bruk'ra. And none quite so willing to wink at Elsweyr's laws, much to Rajhin's benefit."
"115740052-0-34753";"Ah, Orcrest! Kingdom of rogues and thieves. Never did Rajhin feel so welcome within a city's walls. Such a shame that sniveling runt got his claws into it, no?"
"115740052-0-34754";"Few are as skilled as the carpenters of Corinthe. One could say they've carved out a reputation for themselves. Hmm …. No, Rajhin is not pleased with that one."
"115740052-0-34755";"Rajhin did not often visit Helkarn, for there was little gold to be found in a kingdom of shepherds. Besides, they had little kindness for strangers. Especially those in this one's line of work."
"115740052-0-34756";"Ah, Senchal! The city of Rajhin's youth. It was there that he rose from nothing to the Cat-King of Thieves. There are still secret places in Senchal that only this one knows."
"115740052-0-34757";"It was in Tenmar that Rajhin found his first love; a bright-eyed Dagi-raht with fire in her belly. Ever tried to make love in a tree, walker? It is not as fun as it sounds."
"115740052-0-34758";"Torval seems to regard their newest Mane rather highly. To think there would be a day when all of Elsweyr bowed their head to one Khajiit. Not that it's likely to last, of course."
"115740052-0-34759";"The kingdom of Khenarthia; land of sweet treats and sweeter meats. Rajhin even kissed a mermaid on its moonlit shores. Or perhaps it was just a very shapely fish? Hmm."
"115740052-0-34760";"I am … all right. Cadwell, can we use your portal to return to Rimmen?"
"115740052-0-34761";"It is time for this one to share lore about Alkosh, the Dragon King of Cats. Pay heed."
"115740052-0-34762";"Bored now. Where is the food?"
"115740052-0-34763";"Alkosh? I'd rather be chased by guards than listen to this religious dreck. Hmmph."
"115740052-0-34764";"This one has memorized the sacred prayer."
"115740052-0-34765";"The Speaker is correct. There's still work to do. Let's convene in K'har Zhab Hall."
"115740052-0-34770";"Have you heard about the Dragon sightings in Elsweyr? Multiple Dragons? Dark Moons, one Dragon is bad enough!"
"115740052-0-34771";"More than heard. This one saw a Dragon the other day. This one still shudders at the thought of that experience."
"115740052-0-34772";"That sounds frightening! A friend of mine claims they came from the Halls of Colossus. Flew out, roaring angrily at everything! I hope this is just a rumor, though."
"115740052-0-34773";"That's the murderous spirit! Now, go hit the other Xivkyn!"
"115740052-0-34774";"Good! Now put everything you have into it! Don't stop until you're dripping with blood and drowning in madness!"
"115740052-0-34775";"This one thinks not given what he has heard from others and seen for himself. Nobody should have meddled in those ruins, yes? Now we all suffer."
"115740052-0-34776";"Are you ready? This is the best part! The killing part! Go kill the Xivkyn!"
"115740052-0-34777";"So, you heard, right? That they killed a Dragon in Riverhold? And … we have a queen! Can you imagine what this means?"
"115740052-0-34778";"Bright Moons! A better Elsweyr is at hand, yes? Though, it takes a lot of courage to place yourself in opposition to the Usurper Queen. That one must be shaking with rage right now, no?"
"115740052-0-34779";"The Usurper Queen deserves to be more than shaking in anger. Dark Moons beset her. Fah! May Khamira's boldness see her through to her rightful role as our queen!"
"115740052-0-34780";"Boldness is an excellent trait to have in a queen. May she win through all that confronts her and go on to see Elsweyr thrive under her leadership."
"115740052-0-34782";"Gak! Euraxia continually vexes me. And she obviously cares only for Imperials."
"115740052-0-34783";"This one agrees. Perhaps the Khajiit should leave Elsweyr, but this one feels too attached to this land. And, more importantly, it would gift her with victory. The thought of that pains this one."
"115740052-0-34784";"Yes, I've heard many in Elsweyr express their anger and frustration over Euraxia's rule. One Alfiq I know said he almost had the opportunity to knock a potted plant on her head, but a guard spotted him."
"115740052-0-34785";"Dark Moons, this can't continue. Though, this one does find it amusing to think of the Usurper Queen dying at the claws of a single Alfiq armed with gravity and a potted plant."
"115740052-0-34786";"The Dragon is dead! All hail Queen Khamira!"
"115740052-0-34788";"The runes of Oblivion shield me!"
"115740052-0-34789";"Feel the wrath of Euraxia Tharn!"
"115740052-0-34790";"Destroy them, my loyal servants!"
"115740052-0-34791";"Essence of Oblivion, heed my call!"
"115740052-0-34792";"Your life is mine, outsider!"
"115740052-0-34793";"Rise and destroy, my minions!"
"115740052-0-34794";"Let the essence of death flow free!"
"115740052-0-34795";"I can strike from any direction!"
"115740052-0-34796";"Do my portals confuse you? Good!"
"115740052-0-34797";"Chew on these lovely keepsakes, dolts!"
"115740052-0-34798";"Here, let me open wide the path to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-34799";"Oooh, my fur ripples in happiness. Euraxia, the horrid usurper, is deposed? There might not be enough moon-sugar in Tamriel to celebrate that."
"115740052-0-34800";"Indeed! And an outsider stepped in to assist in that, which is a marvel. This one wishes all those involved in this change of circumstance well."
"115740052-0-34801";"With our new queen, I hope to see great things. Though, of course, it can't happen overnight. I must remember my patience."
"115740052-0-34802";"Patience does not agree with you on most days, but it is well to see you continue your practice. As for Elsweyr, yes, much work remains, including these Dragons. This one does not envy our new queen."
"115740052-0-34803";"Why would a Dragon be near the Moon Gate? Do you have any ideas?"
"115740052-0-34804";"This one would love to have the answer to many questions, and the answer to this question in particular eludes him. This one also does not understand the meaning behind the eclipse."
"115740052-0-34805";"One of my other friends claims that this Dragon tried to absorb power from the moon. Ziss'vo, I don't like the sound of that. Surely this isn't possible?"
"115740052-0-34806";"Ah, fear not. That is in the past now. The walker who helped depose Euraxia prevented the Dragon from accomplishing anything. Knowing why all that occurred is what remains for us to puzzle out."
"115740052-0-34810";"At last! Queen Khamira wears the crown! Ah, I'm proud to be living in such times! Aren't you excited?"
"115740052-0-34811";"This one is excited, yes, though perhaps not quite as obviously so as you are. As it stands, the challenges she overcame prove that she deserves to lead Elsweyr against the obstacles that remain."
"115740052-0-34812";"Yes! Exactly! She was brave and bold enough to confront Euraxia and win, plus she stopped the Dragons from gaining whatever power they were seeking. Definitely queen material."
"115740052-0-34813";"As you say. This one looks forward to seeing what she does next."
"115740052-0-34814";"That's far enough! Queen Euraxia doesn't want to be disturbed."
"115740052-0-34815";"I'm hearing troubling rumors about Ashen Scar. Undead, mainly. I guess I can mark visiting there off my list."
"115740052-0-34816";"Ah, yes. The stories of an undead plague there makes this one's fur stand on end. Will we be seeing throngs of undead marching out of there next? Ziss!"
"115740052-0-34817";"You haven't heard that a necromancer is trying to stop the undead? Hmmm … I would not be surprised if you haven't. Because why would a necromancer try to stop undead?"
"115740052-0-34818";"More likely a necromancer seeks to control the undead, yes, not stop them. This one sees where your doubts spring from, most assuredly. I share them."
"115740052-0-34819";"I heard that a necromancer named Vastarie stopped the undead plague in the Ashen Scar. Though maybe she helped the person who actually stopped it?"
"115740052-0-34820";"Bright Moons, that's good news. This one never wants undead flowing out of the Ashen Scar. More solutions before more problems is a better trend."
"115740052-0-34821";"Agreed! But I want to reiterate how suspicious I am of this necromancer's motives. Any necromancer's motives. I don't know. This seems too convenient."
"115740052-0-34822";"No, this one agrees with you. Always question a necromancer's motives. Those who do not inevitably suffer."
"115740052-0-34823";"So, I recently traveled past Two Moons Temple. I hate to say it, but I think the monks there have gone mad."
"115740052-0-34824";"What makes you say that?"
"115740052-0-34825";"They said they were chasing butterflies, but I couldn't see any. They were chasing nothing. It was bizarre and, well, unsettling to see them behave so."
"115740052-0-34826";"You saw nothing? Odd. You mentioned butterflies … this one has a bad feeling about that. A memory teases … and is gone. Ah well."
"115740052-0-34827";"You did it? You did it! I knew you would save us!"
"115740052-0-34828";"Up this way! That greasy pit is no place for our saviors!"
"115740052-0-34829";"One of my friends told me that the monks at Two Moons are no longer chasing invisible butterflies. What a relief! I was worried about them."
"115740052-0-34830";"That is good news indeed! But, do we know what happened there?"
"115740052-0-34831";"Of course, I asked. You know me. It seems that Sheggorath was driving the monks insane until someone came along to stop him. Gak, Sheggorath, of all things!"
"115740052-0-34832";"Yes, this one does know you. And this one is happy that the monks are more themselves again. Chasing invisible butterflies? This one should have known it was the Mad Cat."
"115740052-0-34833";"Do not let them best you, Mulaamnir!"
"115740052-0-34834";"End this, my brother, or I will end you."
"115740052-0-34835";"The power! It fills me!"
"115740052-0-34836";"I will be … the equal of Akatosh!"
"115740052-0-34837";"You cannot defeat me!"
"115740052-0-34838";"No! Arrggghhh!"
"115740052-0-34839";"Watch out, Euraxia's forces have broken through!"
"115740052-0-34840";"Yes, brother, I will make this quick!"
"115740052-0-34841";"I shall crush these fleas, brother! You have my word!"
"115740052-0-34842";"Here they come. Prepare yourself."
"115740052-0-34843";"Kaalgrontiid, assist me!"
"115740052-0-34844";"More soldiers. Take them down!"
"115740052-0-34845";"This way, faithful. Divine Alkosh awaits your rightful adoration in the courtyard."
"115740052-0-34846";"Brace yourselves. To look upon divinity with mortal eyes may be too much to bear for the uninitiated."
"115740052-0-34847";"It's a trick! He'll make slaves of you. Resist while you can!"
"115740052-0-34848";"Kill the cats and the traitors!"
"115740052-0-34849";"Alkosh have mercy! Jone and Jode are gone. Who will protect the chancel?"
"115740052-0-34851";"Bahlokdaan, return to my side!"
"115740052-0-34852";"I know you're in here. We're not letting you leave!"
"115740052-0-34853";"Glorious Alkosh! Your faithful are beset by these heretics! This one begs you to cast the wicked from this mountain once again."
"115740052-0-34854";"You had one task, cat: gather faithful to serve me. Instead you have brought me troubles."
"115740052-0-34855";"Forgive Azin-jo! Spare your faithful from these heretics and this one will spread word of Alkosh's infinite mercy to every corner of the world!"
"115740052-0-34856";"Mercy? I have no use for mercy any longer. Kill them all."
"115740052-0-34857";"Who—who were those bent cats?"
"115740052-0-34858";"There was nothing of the divine in their eyes. Only fear and obedience."
"115740052-0-34859";"Is this what Alkosh wants us to become?"
"115740052-0-34860";"Well done! Now finish this!"
"115740052-0-34861";"There is no escape! I am my realm, and my realm is me!"
"115740052-0-34862";"Weakling! I'll rend your soul to pieces!"
"115740052-0-34863";"There can be no recovery when the lion roars! Come, and test your mettle!"
"115740052-0-34864";"The Pact's fury empowers us! Every strike here cuts the heart! Face me if you dare!"
"115740052-0-34865";"Aldmeri vitality surges through our veins! Make use of it if you can!  You will need it!"
"115740052-0-34866";"How could I … to such…."
"115740052-0-34867";"You know, my mother was right. I should never have wished for a talking housecat. Now I'm riding herd on them?"
"115740052-0-34868";"Your mother told you to be careful what you wish for, too?"
"115740052-0-34869";"Don't all parents tell their children that? Besides, I don't think these Alfiq are that bad. Except for the one with stripes, maybe."
"115740052-0-34870";"The one with stripes? All the Alfiq I've dealt with have stripes!"
"115740052-0-34871";"I should have become a mage. Mages can cast spells to be rid of sand, can't they?"
"115740052-0-34872";"That's your new way of saying you're tired of this place, right?"
"115740052-0-34873";"Weren't you just complaining about snow a few months ago?"
"115740052-0-34874";"My original question stands. This sand is worse than anything."
"115740052-0-34875";"I'm surprised that we don't see giant balls of fur rolling across the landscape here."
"115740052-0-34876";"Ummm … I'm pretty sure that every Khajiit is a giant ball of fur. Some more giant than others. Some less."
"115740052-0-34877";"True enough. And if I find another bit of fur in my food, I'm going to hork up a furball soon."
"115740052-0-34878";"Going native, eh? Well, just give me some warning before you do. I don't want to step in it."
"115740052-0-34881";"More undead!"
"115740052-0-34882";"A secret passage, eh? Raz thought he felt a draft in here."
"115740052-0-34883";"Look! There is a door behind these stones. Is this the place we seek?"
"115740052-0-34884";"Your knees shouldn't make that noise, right?"
"115740052-0-34885";"They should make no noise, Vole."
"115740052-0-34886";"You were supposed to avoid the guards! What's done is done. No one has raised the alarm yet."
"115740052-0-34887";"Azin-jo! Mojha speaks the truth! These Dragons are no gods."
"115740052-0-34888";"We must leave before … oh."
"115740052-0-34889";"It is a sadness, but we are free now."
"115740052-0-34891";"Sister! Oh, you're going to pay for that!"
"115740052-0-34892";"Brother! Curse you, you meddling bastards. Curse you!"
"115740052-0-34893";"We could have … made a deal."
"115740052-0-34894";"This won't be good for business …."
"115740052-0-34895";"Death is only the beginning."
"115740052-0-34896";"Victory for Ne-Quin-Al! Victory for Darloc Brae!"
"115740052-0-34897";"Through Daedric hordes, through death itself! Still, we fight!"
"115740052-0-34898";"At least I outlived that accursed cat."
"115740052-0-34899";"Is Grundwulf …?"
"115740052-0-34900";"No. The fool's gone for the Dragon. You've got to stop him."
"115740052-0-34901";"Why, look at you all! A feast worthy of a king."
"115740052-0-34902";"You are unclean! You are all unclean!"
"115740052-0-34903";"Let the city be cleansed in flames!"
"115740052-0-34904";"Dad'na fifeh'rai!"
"115740052-0-34905";"Zubhal'jay jomba ahn luz!"
"115740052-0-34906";"Friinj'ah ka'is!"
"115740052-0-34907";"No, five-claw! Not yet!"
"115740052-0-34909";"You are an ant trying to shoulder the world."
"115740052-0-34910";"Bloated tick. You've drunk to bursting."
"115740052-0-34911";"Ha! She did it! The door's unlocked! Let's head in."
"115740052-0-34913";"You won't rob me of this!"
"115740052-0-34914";"The temple … it shows us how the Betrayer became attuned."
"115740052-0-34915";"This place has guardians, it seems … but they could not stop the Betrayer."
"115740052-0-34917";"Trespassers! We will turn you to slag!"
"115740052-0-34918";"How dare you interrupt the channeling!"
"115740052-0-34919";"This one must warn the others!"
"115740052-0-34920";"The banner's vitality surges through our veins! Make use of it if you can!  You will need it!"
"115740052-0-34921";"There can be no recovery where this banner stands! Come, and test your mettle!"
"115740052-0-34922";"The fury standard empowers us! Every strike here cuts the heart! Face me if you dare!"
"115740052-0-34923";"Find me later, walker!"
"115740052-0-34925";"Outsider, this one must speak with you."
"115740052-0-34926";"Five-claw, a word."
"115740052-0-34928";"Let us begin!"
"115740052-0-34929";"Sleek work! You strike well, but can you guard?"
"115740052-0-34930";"Sov Ag Slen!"
"115740052-0-34931";"Diiv Mir Tah!"
"115740052-0-34932";"Diiv!"
"115740052-0-34933";"Lok Diil On!"
"115740052-0-34934";"Lok!"
"115740052-0-34935";"Bo Het Lo!"
"115740052-0-34936";"Du Kun Shaan!"
"115740052-0-34937";"Sos Jiid Viin!"
"115740052-0-34938";"Sos!"
"115740052-0-34939";"Bex Miir Kein!"
"115740052-0-34940";"Viir Su Pook!"
"115740052-0-34941";"Qeth Krii Gol!"
"115740052-0-34942";"Jol Fus Daal!"
"115740052-0-34943";"Roth Nihn Fey!"
"115740052-0-34944";"Wiix Lo Feim!"
"115740052-0-34945";"Al Gron Nok!"
"115740052-0-34946";"Dey Rah Zaam!"
"115740052-0-34947";"Rii Vaaz Bex!"
"115740052-0-34948";"Zey Qeth Lok!"
"115740052-0-34949";"Fus Ro Dah!"
"115740052-0-34950";"Fus!"
"115740052-0-34951";"Gaan Lah Haas!"
"115740052-0-34952";"Tiid Klo Ul!"
"115740052-0-34953";"Strun Bah Qo!"
"115740052-0-34954";"Strun!"
"115740052-0-34955";"Diil Qoth Zaam!"
"115740052-0-34956";"Diil!"
"115740052-0-34957";"Jiid So Daan!"
"115740052-0-34958";"Yol Toor Shul!"
"115740052-0-34959";"Fo Krah Diin!"
"115740052-0-34960";"Mid Vur Shaan!"
"115740052-0-34961";"Gaar Toor Nah!"
"115740052-0-34962";"Mul Bah Rein!"
"115740052-0-34963";"Kriid Iiz Gron!"
"115740052-0-34964";"Vah Yol Ron!"
"115740052-0-34965";"Tiid Klo Ul!"
"115740052-0-34966";"Kren Qeth Gol!"
"115740052-0-34967";"Krii Lun Aus!"
"115740052-0-34968";"Rii Vaaz Zol!"
"115740052-0-34969";"Tiid Grah Kron!"
"115740052-0-34970";"Jud Hof Liik!"
"115740052-0-34971";"Jud!"
"115740052-0-34972";"Nel Jaag Moh!"
"115740052-0-34973";"Nel!"
"115740052-0-34974";"Riis Thaan Kohg!"
"115740052-0-34975";"Riis!"
"115740052-0-34977";"Golt!"
"115740052-0-34978";"Golt Mah!"
"115740052-0-34979";"Golt Mah Nos!"
"115740052-0-34980";"Jiid!"
"115740052-0-34981";"Viin!"
"115740052-0-34982";"A cowardly attack! Bahlokdaan will crush you!"
"115740052-0-34983";"Such masterful strikes! But what if you are in distress?"
"115740052-0-34984";"With strength such as yours, nothing can hold you back!"
"115740052-0-34985";"When your enemy charges their assault, strike! Interrupt their attack and punish their hesitation!"
"115740052-0-34986";"Protect the Devourer! Avenge Nisaazda!"
"115740052-0-34987";"Soon the Devourer will consume you all!"
"115740052-0-34988";"That mark has four points, like the note says."
"115740052-0-34989";"Of course, Khamira. It's ready."
"115740052-0-34991";"You dare ignore Mulaamnir? Impudent morsel! Euraxia is our puppet, and her army is ours to command. Leave Elsweyr and take the battlemage with you or when next we meet, you will die!"
"115740052-0-34992";"It seems you are done with our lesson, yes? Very well."
"115740052-0-34993";"Su!"
"115740052-0-34994";"Gaan!"
"115740052-0-34995";"Fus Ro Dah!"
"115740052-0-34997";"Oh, agh. The Dragon's corruption has spread farther, Carindon. Closer to you and Selene."
"115740052-0-34998";"Yes, this is … unfortunate. I will do what I can. But, Selene? She is difficult to persuade, at best."
"115740052-0-34999";"Selene might've been less difficult if you hadn't chosen to make her the subject of your research."
"115740052-0-35000";"Z'en's bargain, we're not torturers! I've come to restore the balance here."
"115740052-0-35001";"Am I to understand you're a follower of Z'en? Return my freedom and I will right the wrongs done here."
"115740052-0-35002";"Unbind her, Carindon."
"115740052-0-35003";"Now for payment in kind. It's my turn to study your insides, warlock!"
"115740052-0-35004";"Selene! No! Don't let her kill Carindon! We need them both!"
"115740052-0-35005";"Enough! I relent."
"115740052-0-35006";"See what you wish to bargain with? She must remain bound."
"115740052-0-35007";"Can you two please take your hands off each others' throats long enough to see there is a bloody Dragon turning this place into a fetid latrine!"
"115740052-0-35008";"I … concede your point. This Dragon blight is a threat to you, Selene. You will not overcome it without me."
"115740052-0-35009";"I'll need to draw on more than you to oppose Maarselok. You Bosmer must be my connection to the Green."
"115740052-0-35010";"Look! Maarselok!"
"115740052-0-35011";"Another rare specimen."
"115740052-0-35012";"Is there nothing you won't objectify?"
"115740052-0-35013";"Maarselok! You'll pay for defiling this place!"
"115740052-0-35015";"He's playing with us!"
"115740052-0-35016";"Good. Underestimating us will be his undoing."
"115740052-0-35017";"Unleash me, and he won't be laughing much longer."
"115740052-0-35018";"I'll give you only the slack you need, hound, no more. Now sniff out the Dragon before he escapes us."
"115740052-0-35019";"I can feel it. Everywhere. Seeping into everything."
"115740052-0-35020";"Stop fighting my control and I can more easily shield you from its influence."
"115740052-0-35021";"One toxic influence for another."
"115740052-0-35022";"There. That writhing mass is the source of the cancer in this cavern. It must be purged."
"115740052-0-35023";"Leave it. Its proximity is already beginning to taint you."
"115740052-0-35024";"Destroying it weakens Maarselok's hold!"
"115740052-0-35025";"We're destroying it! Help Selene however you can!"
"115740052-0-35027";"Ugh. It's done …."
"115740052-0-35028";"Selene? Are you alright?"
"115740052-0-35029";"As I said, we should be conserving our energy."
"115740052-0-35030";"I am no one's pet!"
"115740052-0-35031";"There you are, my pet. I feared you lost interest."
"115740052-0-35033";"Rrragh! You won't escape! I'll hunt you to the ends of the world!"
"115740052-0-35034";"Enough running, coward."
"115740052-0-35035";"Oh, yes. Welcome to my web, spider-witch. I'll make you feel quite at home."
"115740052-0-35036";"Z'en above! We did it!"
"115740052-0-35037";"And we're all alive! Somehow. You all really pulled through for us. Even you, Carindon."
"115740052-0-35038";"Did I not agree to lend you Selene's aid? I expect payment from your king, promptly."
"115740052-0-35039";"You don't speak for me, oathbreaker. Your promises aren't worth the air you waste speaking them."
"115740052-0-35041";"If you … insist."
"115740052-0-35043";"Through the portal, fleas. There is work to do on my island."
"115740052-0-35044";"Kaalgrontiid? Here? We must find him!"
"115740052-0-35045";"Carry the stone into the portal, fleas. The time of my ascension draws close."
"115740052-0-35046";"You shall be the first to behold the rise of the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-35047";"The portal just closed. Tharn, can you open it?"
"115740052-0-35048";"Perhaps, but not by myself. Champion, let's talk."
"115740052-0-35049";"It's open … our way to the island. Sai, go … prepare the Dragonguard …."
"115740052-0-35050";"Go? You can barely stand, old man!"
"115740052-0-35051";"Ah, there you are."
"115740052-0-35052";"We can depart for the Abbey of Blades as soon as you're ready."
"115740052-0-35053";"A Dragon, but it's not Kaalgrontiid!"
"115740052-0-35054";"A throne in the sky? Forget the source of the island's defenses. We need to destroy these ritual sites!"
"115740052-0-35055";"You've got what you wanted. Honor the pact and release me."
"115740052-0-35056";"The Wood Elves made that foolish bargain. I never agreed to it."
"115740052-0-35057";"That tapestry. Give me a moment to study it."
"115740052-0-35058";"Ah, Kasura sent word to expect you. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-35059";"Liar! I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-35060";"This one does not see the point of such a thing."
"115740052-0-35061";"Does it not entertain? What more reason does Khajiit need?"
"115740052-0-35062";"Is it a toy or a tool?"
"115740052-0-35063";"Why not both?"
"115740052-0-35064";"You made quick work of them."
"115740052-0-35065";"Don't let the gate trouble you. I'll pass through and open it from the other side."
"115740052-0-35066";"There's no mechanism. Khajiit and their tricks. Look for a hidden switch. I'll try to catch up to Grundwulf."
"115740052-0-35067";"Go on. Give it a good swat."
"115740052-0-35068";"Like that?"
"115740052-0-35069";"The harder you strike the farther it goes. Yet it does not matter what you strike it with."
"115740052-0-35070";"Interesting. Let me try something."
"115740052-0-35071";"Stand back. Let me try."
"115740052-0-35072";"I may regret this later, but I'm going to borrow some of this energy. Let's return to the central chamber and get our bearings."
"115740052-0-35074";"So much … power!"
"115740052-0-35076";"I'll deal with this creature."
"115740052-0-35077";"That … drove it off. Now … to find the source … of the aegis."
"115740052-0-35078";"Another tapestry. And that's clearly a Dragon. Hmm."
"115740052-0-35079";"Up there! That's Kaalgrontiid!"
"115740052-0-35080";"Protect me while I try to destroy the aegis! Joorahmaar may be wounded, but he's still a Dragon!"
"115740052-0-35081";"I destroyed the aegis, but now we need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-35082";"Dragon's bones, we're up in the sky!"
"115740052-0-35083";"I may have dealt with the island's defenses, but whatever Kaalgrontiid is doing is getting stronger."
"115740052-0-35084";"These ruins won't stand much more of this. We need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-35085";"Over here! I told you I sensed Tharn's magic."
"115740052-0-35086";"Then where is—by the sacred sons of Yokuda! Up in the sky!"
"115740052-0-35087";"It seems this sanctuary won't easily give up its secrets. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-35089";"We honor you, Grandmasters of old. May your flames burn eternal."
"115740052-0-35090";"That did it! Look, a grapple point has appeared on the platform above."
"115740052-0-35091";"What an archive! If the empire knew anything, it was the value of keeping good records."
"115740052-0-35092";"How goes the search? Come, tell me what you discovered so far."
"115740052-0-35093";"Any luck over there?"
"115740052-0-35094";"You get used to it. And that was your best one yet."
"115740052-0-35095";"Excellent work! Now see what you can find in the archives!"
"115740052-0-35096";"I'll meet you at Dark Water Temple."
"115740052-0-35097";"I don't see a way farther into the sanctuary. Perhaps you'll have better luck."
"115740052-0-35098";"A grapple point! And there's an urn beside it. Why don't you see what it contains?"
"115740052-0-35099";"That's Dragonbone powder. The ancient Dragonguard used it in their ceremonies."
"115740052-0-35100";"Of course. The powder reveals a hidden path. Follow it, quickly!"
"115740052-0-35101";"Another archive, but no Dragonhorn in sight. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-35102";"Have you found something?"
"115740052-0-35103";"We're part of the Dragonguard, Aeliah! It's not stealing."
"115740052-0-35104";"I assume you told Kasura of our adventure, warrior."
"115740052-0-35105";"Oh no. Oh no, no, no."
"115740052-0-35106";"Out! Out of this temple! You disrespect Khenarthi with your very presence!"
"115740052-0-35107";"Then this one will speak with your companions. As for you? Out!"
"115740052-0-35108";"Mother! It's been so long."
"115740052-0-35109";"Please, this is important. We're trying to save all of Elsweyr."
"115740052-0-35110";"Za'ji will, uh … wait outside."
"115740052-0-35111";"I'll secure the horses while you go on ahead."
"115740052-0-35115";"Even an arrow will do. You could flick it with your little finger and the enchantment would scoot it along. A curious thing."
"115740052-0-35134";"The fragments fit together? What does it say?"
"115740052-0-35135";"Anequina … Flinthild … Nurarion …."
"115740052-0-35136";"Those names. From the legends Abnur goes on and on about. The Khajiiti hero, Khunzar-ri."
"115740052-0-35137";"Khajiit and their riddles. But when I said Khunzar-ri's name, the aura disappeared. Try the door now."
"115740052-0-35138";"Zar was thinking, five-claw will never decipher the clues. Then, to Zar's surprise, here you are!"
"115740052-0-35140";"Take Zar's claw to the Anequina of this age. She can use it to get your kra'jun to Dragonhold."
"115740052-0-35141";"We found the bell, mother! At great risk to life and limb, we heroically fought our way—"
"115740052-0-35142";"Stop bragging and have your friend place the bell on its hook. Tadali wants to look at it."
"115740052-0-35143";"No, no, this won't do. The bell is tarnished. It can't perform the ritual like this."
"115740052-0-35146";"First, we must listen for Khenarthi's breath. Not just the wind, mind you, but her holy exhalations."
"115740052-0-35147";"And how long will that take?"
"115740052-0-35148";"As long as it needs to. Sacred rituals should not be rushed."
"115740052-0-35149";"We're trying to save Elsweyr, mother! There must be a faster way."
"115740052-0-35150";"Fine. If you think you can cleanse the bell faster, go ahead. But don't expect this one to help you."
"115740052-0-35152";"All right, Za'ji has seen mother ring the bells a thousand times. Just press here …."
"115740052-0-35153";"Huh. Za'ji didn't expect that. Wait, wait. The big bells in this courtyard have the same colored lanterns!"
"115740052-0-35154";"Get out of my way! It's Carindon I want!"
"115740052-0-35155";"We did it! We cleansed the bell!"
"115740052-0-35156";"Yes, yes, you did a beautiful job. Come, walker, speak to Tadali."
"115740052-0-35157";"Walker? Oh! She means you, my friend."
"115740052-0-35158";"Through the sweet winds of Khenarthi and the ringing of the bells, tell us where Yahgrondu dwells!"
"115740052-0-35159";"The winds journey south, sweeping cliffs of lime, and sink deep in a cave that smells of brine. They brush past a Dragon's might to dissolve within a terrible light."
"115740052-0-35160";"Late again … how typical."
"115740052-0-35161";"Za'ji, let Sai Sahan know where we're going. We might need his help."
"115740052-0-35163";"Hmph."
"115740052-0-35165";"The Dragon's lair should be nearby. Be on your guard, warrior."
"115740052-0-35166";"That Khajiiti ruin in the distance. A fine place for a Dragon to nest."
"115740052-0-35168";"We … we actually did it. We killed Kaalgrontiid!"
"115740052-0-35169";"Curious. It seems this place once served as a kwama mine, though it appears abandoned now."
"115740052-0-35170";"The Dragon's roar has stirred the kwama! Defend yourself!"
"115740052-0-35171";"By Sep's scales, a drawbridge blocks our way! See if you can find any clue as to how to operate the pulleys."
"115740052-0-35172";"I see it! The Horn of Ja'darri is just ahead!"
"115740052-0-35173";"Vahlokzin is dead. We should return to the Abbey of Blades."
"115740052-0-35174";"The island. It's shaking apart. What's happening?"
"115740052-0-35175";"The energy in the aeonstone … we need to contain it before it explodes!"
"115740052-0-35176";"Join me, brother. My master's power is limitless and he will share it with his devoted."
"115740052-0-35177";"The Dragon uses kwama as a form of defense. How cowardly."
"115740052-0-35178";"I will die before I bow to you or your master, Laatvulon."
"115740052-0-35180";"If you insist."
"115740052-0-35181";"Get them out of here, Khamira. I know you can do it."
"115740052-0-35182";"Tharn …."
"115740052-0-35183";"Tharn will do what he always does. He'll save Tamriel."
"115740052-0-35184";"We need to get out of here. Nahfahlaar, can you fly us off the island?"
"115740052-0-35185";"The beast attacks! To arms!"
"115740052-0-35186";"Finally awake, I see? Come stand with me, five-claw."
"115740052-0-35188";"Dark Moons …!"
"115740052-0-35189";"Mind the gaps between the stars, dear friends. Zar will feel terrible if any of you fall."
"115740052-0-35192";"My hands are tied. We don't have the resources to investigate your daughter's disappearance."
"115740052-0-35194";"The end is near, dear friends. You can almost smell Kaalgrontiid's stench from here."
"115740052-0-35195";"Pardon the interruption. Do you have a moment, father?"
"115740052-0-35198";"Arniel Branck! We're ready for you now."
"115740052-0-35199";"Finally! I thought I'd never get off this dock."
"115740052-0-35200";"You said you had a ship manifest. May this one inspect it?"
"115740052-0-35201";"Yes, if you must. It's right on this crate."
"115740052-0-35202";"All right, this shouldn't take long."
"115740052-0-35203";"Hmm? Is something the matter?"
"115740052-0-35204";"Do you play games with this one? There's no manifest on this crate."
"115740052-0-35205";"What? No, that can't be right. I'm sure it was there."
"115740052-0-35206";"Need this one remind you, all ships without a sanctioned manifest will be subject to—"
"115740052-0-35207";"I know the law! But I'm telling you, the manifest was on this crate!"
"115740052-0-35208";"Unless you can produce it, we'll have to inspect your cargo."
"115740052-0-35209";"But … but … that could take hours! I have an appointment!"
"115740052-0-35210";"Just wait until my guild hears about this brutish treatment! They won't let it stand, I can assure you of that!"
"115740052-0-35211";"Damn dungy birds!"
"115740052-0-35212";"Halt! Official business only!"
"115740052-0-35213";"We have an appointment with General Renmus. Here. Our papers."
"115740052-0-35214";"These seem to be in order. All right, you can go in."
"115740052-0-35215";"I can't wait much longer, Safik. If Daini doesn't come back soon …."
"115740052-0-35216";"She will be back any minute! Trust Safik! Here, have some soup while you wait. You love soup! Right? Everyone loves soup."
"115740052-0-35217";"Safik? Galeneth? Ah, there you are. And Sormund remains? Good."
"115740052-0-35218";"Not for much longer, Daini. I leave with the tide, with or without you."
"115740052-0-35219";"What are you up to now, Daini?"
"115740052-0-35220";"What you asked, Sormund! Don't worry. You'll have your goods soon enough."
"115740052-0-35221";"Next time there's a Dragon, Za'ji does not want to be left behind."
"115740052-0-35222";"I don't recall you jumping forward to challenge Laatvulon."
"115740052-0-35223";"Now, now Aeliah. The captain always maintains a tactical distance."
"115740052-0-35224";"Tactical distance … right. Za'ji is nothing if not prudent."
"115740052-0-35225";"Look who's back!"
"115740052-0-35227";"Mask-bearer. We must share words."
"115740052-0-35228";"We may meet again, mask-bearer. The world is not so very large. And do not worry about the mask. Like me, it will bide its time until it is again needed."
"115740052-0-35229";"Tell the Dragonguard. They have my respect."
"115740052-0-35230";"Aeliah! Walker! Come join us. We were just about to order another round."
"115740052-0-35231";"I should have known we'd find him here."
"115740052-0-35232";"How can we protect you, my queen, if you continue to leave us behind?"
"115740052-0-35233";"I am no fragile kitten, Zamarak. My duty will always take precedence."
"115740052-0-35234";"Don't get us kicked out! Za'ji just started this pint."
"115740052-0-35235";"Caska the Unconquered? I, uh, didn't realize you were the friend."
"115740052-0-35236";"I can see why you're so popular, Kazahn. You have a pretty throat."
"115740052-0-35237";"I, well … thank you?"
"115740052-0-35238";"Look, here comes the slayer of Kaalgrontiid!"
"115740052-0-35239";"Yeah, all seven of them …."
"115740052-0-35240";"I told you to go easy on the plum brandy."
"115740052-0-35241";"People of Senchal, let us recognize the efforts of the Dragonguard. They saved Elsweyr from the rage of Dragons."
"115740052-0-35242";"Second, it brings me great joy to mark the return of Sai Sahan and the Dragonguard. May you always watch over us all."
"115740052-0-35243";"The honor is ours, Queen Khamira."
"115740052-0-35244";"First, let us bow our heads and remember Abnur Tharn, who gave his life to save Tamriel."
"115740052-0-35245";"And finally, join me in honoring my friend and champion, who ended the threat of Kaalgrontiid once and for all. Three cheers for five-claw! Three cheers for the Dragonguard!"
"115740052-0-35246";"Three beers? No, Za'ji has had enough, thank you."
"115740052-0-35248";"Blessed Mara, we're out of time. He's going to kill Safik! We have to get back! Now!"
"115740052-0-35249";"Shame if someone ripped it out."
"115740052-0-35250";"Of course! Followed him right to the harbor."
"115740052-0-35251";"Lies! You can't even follow your own two feet."
"115740052-0-35252";"Can too! Here, Ranza will show you. Look."
"115740052-0-35253";"I'll just draw you a quick map …. And there we go! Perfect!"
"115740052-0-35254";"That's … terrible."
"115740052-0-35256";"Dragons take me …."
"115740052-0-35257";"Use my glyphs to purge the blight! Just like before."
"115740052-0-35258";"If you won't submit willingly, I'll just have to bend your knees for you."
"115740052-0-35260";"Thank you for your time, general. Come, my friend. Let's speak outside."
"115740052-0-35261";"Refugees from the recent Dragon attacks have flooded Senchal. They have lost homes and livelihoods. Despite the city's best efforts, most go to sleep hungry each night."
"115740052-0-35262";"Many take advantage of these hopeless souls. Thieves and cutthroats steal any item of value they still carry. While these refugees languish, the city's underbelly thrives."
"115740052-0-35263";"While the Dragons ravage this land, these people will suffer. That is why we must fight. Not for glory, not for fame, but for the innocents of Elsweyr who cannot fight for themselves."
"115740052-0-35264";"Wait! Hold on!"
"115740052-0-35265";"I think I know someone who can help you."
"115740052-0-35266";"I should head back to the palace. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-35267";"So, Daini and her dock-tailed brother try to steal from me, eh? Truly, I should have burned those two with their father. Easily remedied, though. Thank you, Antonia."
"115740052-0-35268";"Oh, you're welcome, Turo! Anything for you!"
"115740052-0-35269";"Walker! You up there?"
"115740052-0-35271";"Then let's get going!"
"115740052-0-35272";"Oh, right. I'll head back to the sanctum with Za'ji."
"115740052-0-35273";"Not you, little one. The Black Kiergo is no place for the general's daughter."

"115740052-0-35344";"Well, that certainly didn't go as planned."
"115740052-0-35345";"Save your posturing, Sai. I missed you, too, but we have a bigger problem to deal with."
"115740052-0-35346";"Watch out!"
"115740052-0-35347";"Hey, look at this! A letter from mother. Peculiar, isn't it?"

"115740052-0-35353";"Enough! Do you accept the plan?"

"115740052-0-35362";"No more portals, Tharn. Not right now. I have duties other than conveying you around, you know."

"115740052-0-35395";"The mine's entrance should be west of here. You take the lead."
"115740052-0-35396";"Laatvulon! And the other Dragon … is that Yahgrondu?"
"115740052-0-35399";"You found a way inside. And without my help. Good."
"115740052-0-35400";"Back on your feet, old man? Let me know if you need a litter."
"115740052-0-35401";"A jest? I find it hard to tell through all that facial hair. Now focus. We'll need your fighting skills inside."
"115740052-0-35404";"Hmm."
"115740052-0-35405";"door lock"
"115740052-0-35407";"Let's discuss our plan of attack."
"115740052-0-35408";"The inner temple is just ahead. Let's move!"
"115740052-0-35409";"Aeliah, Caska. You're with me. Stick close and prepare to fight."
"115740052-0-35410";"I'm always ready to fight. Just keep an eye on the little one."
"115740052-0-35411";"I can take care of myself, you know."
"115740052-0-35412";"So much death. What could possibly warrant this massacre?"
"115740052-0-35413";"You never cease to surprise me, Sai."
"115740052-0-35414";"What now, old man?"
"115740052-0-35415";"In the past, I considered you nothing more than Varen's muscle. But here you are, leading a new generation of Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-35416";"Your point, Tharn?"
"115740052-0-35417";"Just contemplating how some people adapt to change."
"115740052-0-35418";"Some seek change, others have it forced upon them."
"115740052-0-35419";"Wisdom from an empty well, here in the belly of our enemy. Let's stick to the matter at hand, shall we?"
"115740052-0-35420";"Who are these people? And why are they attacking us?"
"115740052-0-35421";"They are enemies to be defeated. Nothing else matters."
"115740052-0-35422";"Be prepared, little one! I can smell them coming."
"115740052-0-35423";"How many?"
"115740052-0-35424";"Does it matter? They will die all the same."
"115740052-0-35425";"Where are you, vile beast? Show yourself!"
"115740052-0-35426";"Prepare to meet your end!"
"115740052-0-35427";"Sep's Scales. See if she's still breathing."
"115740052-0-35428";"Step away, Dragonguard. She has passed on."
"115740052-0-35429";"The horn didn't work … how?"
"115740052-0-35430";"Of course not. That's my horn, mortals. Tell me how you came to possess it."
"115740052-0-35431";"My companion will speak with you, Dragon. But make one wrong move and my blade will cut deep."
"115740052-0-35432";"Kaalgrontiid!"
"115740052-0-35433";"Even this tattered scrap is as vibrant as she remembered. She can't wait to see the rest again."
"115740052-0-35434";"That should allow me to open the portal to Dragonhold."
"115740052-0-35435";"Lady Bebbia, on my honor as an artisan I will restore Khajiit of the Moons to its former glory."
"115740052-0-35436";"This is … harder than I thought …."
"115740052-0-35437";"Don't argue with me. Kaalgrontiid's plans near completion … and it will take all of us to stop him. Go!"
"115740052-0-35438";"Damn you, Tharn. I'll leave, but you better not die before I return."
"115740052-0-35439";"This one read it took twelve years to weave Khajiit of the Moons, she hopes it will not take that long to restore its beauty."
"115740052-0-35440";"I'll begin securing this in place. You may add any other pieces you recover to the frame and I will handle the rest."
"115740052-0-35441";"How does it look, sir Loche? Can we make it whole again?"
"115740052-0-35442";"Mending the tears will not be the troublesome part. This work will bear scars, but I will endeavor to make them enhance its beauty."
"115740052-0-35443";"The Clan Mother spoke of the statue. We should examine it."
"115740052-0-35444";"Yes, of course. The statue wears a mask, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-35445";"The general doesn't see anyone without an appointment."
"115740052-0-35446";"This doesn't look good."
"115740052-0-35447";"Walker? Praise Alkosh! Quickly, cut me down and get this door open. We can use Turo's boat to escape!"
"115740052-0-35448";"Continue to feed the ritual sites. Kaalgrontiid demands a throne in the sky. We must accomplish this or perish!"
"115740052-0-35449";"It's a moot point. We just need to convince her that the Dragon is a greater enemy than Carindon."
"115740052-0-35450";"Wait for me to get in position. We should strike at the same time."
"115740052-0-35451";"The New Moon will rise above, and all who obey shall rise with it!"
"115740052-0-35452";"Relinquish your strength to the aeonstone! Offer your power to our noble cause!"
"115740052-0-35453";"Your power is mine. Los dii!"
"115740052-0-35454";"These bells look just like the ones in Khenarthi's Breath Temple. And look! They're all tarnished."
"115740052-0-35455";"You promised us power, Laatvulon."
"115740052-0-35456";"And you shall have it, my brother."
"115740052-0-35460";"Hey! Over here! Could use a little help."
"115740052-0-35462";"The power coursing through these stones … it could move a mountain!"
"115740052-0-35463";"The Empire must endure!"
"115740052-0-35464";"Who dares disrupt our ritual?"
"115740052-0-35467";"You think to challenge me, bug?"
"115740052-0-35468";"Surrender, Nisaazda, or are you going to fight us all?"
"115740052-0-35469";"That's better. Now, where did those tuskless runts stow my armor?"
"115740052-0-35470";"Ah, here it is. Now, let's have a look around. Need to find out where those bastards ran off to."
"115740052-0-35471";"Krii volaanne! Kill them all!"
"115740052-0-35472";"I need to walk off this headache. If you find Selloe before I do, meet me at Senchal's marketplace, all right?"
"115740052-0-35473";"Good, you made it. I think we lost them for now."
"115740052-0-35476";"What pests dare scurry in this sacred place?"
"115740052-0-35477";"Savor this reprieve, mortals. You cannot stop the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-35478";"Trespassers! You will not destroy the aegis!"
"115740052-0-35479";"A dead end. There's no choice. I'll open a portal to the main land."
"115740052-0-35480";"Hurry. It will take the last of my remaining strength to hold this open."
"115740052-0-35481";"Find Khamira and Sai Sahan. Prepare the Dragonguard to attack. I'll … be ready when you return."
"115740052-0-35482";"Over here, walker. This was written by the Clan Mother. Could be important."
"115740052-0-35483";"Oh. Hello there. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
"115740052-0-35488";"The island is floating, Dragon! I saw it with my own eyes!"
"115740052-0-35489";"Kaalgrontiid seeks to fulfill the prophecy. I must keep the lesser Dragons from attending him on Dragonhold."
"115740052-0-35490";"I could try to open a portal, but without Tharn's guidance I do not even know how to begin."
"115740052-0-35491";"What do we do now? How are we going to get to Dragonhold?"
"115740052-0-35492";"Meet with me by the stables after you speak with Kasura."
"115740052-0-35493";"Dak'radhi, Dak'radhi, dance with me!"
"115740052-0-35494";"Gah! I warned you of her duplicity!"
"115740052-0-35495";"Taking you apart has taught me how to put you back together. You'll be grateful for that as the Dragon's blight rots you from within."
"115740052-0-35497";"Finally! Over there!"
"115740052-0-35498";"Didn't I say we'd find them here? Pay up, captain!"
"115740052-0-35499";"Bah! Put it on Za'ji's tab."
"115740052-0-35500";"Hmm, I don't like the way this island is shaking."
"115740052-0-35501";"Let's not linger in these caves. It feels like the ceiling might collapse at any moment."
"115740052-0-35502";"The tremors seem to be intensifying. What's happening?"
"115740052-0-35504";"More cultists. Where do the Dragons find these demented Khajiit?"
"115740052-0-35505";"You have both ventured far and come so close, but only one may claim the Mask of Alkosh."
"115740052-0-35506";"You who heard the Clan Mother's dying words. Go now and claim that which you earned."
"115740052-0-35517";"Skordo? My friend. You … you came for us?"
"115740052-0-35518";"Yeah, Taj. Just too late. Damn it. Can you walk? Come on. Stay with me, whiskers."
"115740052-0-35519";"Go, my friend. Tell Marekki … tell her …."
"115740052-0-35520";"I'll find Marekki. You got my word on that. See if there's anything you can do for him, pal, then meet me at the ruins as soon as you can."
"115740052-0-35521";"Caska the Unconquered, in the fur! This one knew you would return one day."
"115740052-0-35522";"I'm not here to fight. We seek entrance, nothing more."
"115740052-0-35527";"He's up there. By that spire."
"115740052-0-35528";"Ugh, the blight's everywhere. We have to hurry. Help Selene cleanse a path through."
"115740052-0-35529";"All right, you muskarse. I'll fight."
"115740052-0-35530";"This one had a feeling you would come around."
"115740052-0-35532";"To think that a Dragonguard sanctuary was hidden beneath HoonDing's Watch all this time!"
"115740052-0-35533";"Moons guide me … what am I to do?"
"115740052-0-35534";"Very well. We can depart for Storm Talon Temple after you take a look around."
"115740052-0-35535";"Anequina … reveal your memories to me …."
"115740052-0-35536";"The answer you seek … resides in the cavern of the Moon's sacred light …."
"115740052-0-35537";"That was … I don't know what that was! Queen Khamira, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-35538";"You disgusting furball. Did you honestly think you could kill Lady Ghisiliane?"
"115740052-0-35539";"Skordo? Moons' mercy, am I glad to see you! We kill Lady G together, yes?"
"115740052-0-35540";"She's here? Got to tell you, it's tempting, but we've got to get you out of here. Come on."
"115740052-0-35541";"Make it hurt, walker!"
"115740052-0-35543";"I've got to get this one to safety. Kill that damned Elf and end this. Meet you on the road—northeast, past the hunt master, all right? Come on, cat."
"115740052-0-35544";"I'm sorry about Tajahir, Marekki. Just wasn't fast enough, you know?"
"115740052-0-35545";"Don't blame yourself. You came back for us, yes? That's far more than most would do. You have a good heart, Skordo the Knife."
"115740052-0-35546";"All right, all right. Don't go getting all sentimental on me."
"115740052-0-35547";"And so our match is completed! Come, champions. Meet with Shirnama and learn your destiny!"
"115740052-0-35548";"You'll pay dearly for all of this, Dragon!"
"115740052-0-35549";"So this is Storm Talon Temple. Seems more like a maze than a sanctuary."
"115740052-0-35550";"Let her go, you cad!"
"115740052-0-35551";"Again you prove yourself too dangerous to let roam. Perhaps when you're tamed."
"115740052-0-35552";"I am spent, my friend. But Marekki … she was alive when …. She is in the ruins. North of here. She plans to do something rash. Go, Skordo. Find her!"
"115740052-0-35553";"Ah, yes, well. This one may not have left home on the … best of terms."
"115740052-0-35555";"Oh. I'm sorry, Za'ji, I didn't mean to pry. Do you want to wait outside?"
"115740052-0-35556";"Lovely Aeliah, your words are as a soothing balm! With you by Za'ji's side, he can do anything. Let's venture forth."
"115740052-0-35557";"Here we are! Khenarthi's Breath Temple, home to sweet winds and pleasant chimes."
"115740052-0-35558";"Za'ji, I don't like your tone. Is there something you're not telling us?"
"115740052-0-35560";"Should Za'ji go in? Of course he should go in! Za'ji found the bell, didn't he?"
"115740052-0-35561";"All this way for the remains of a legend? I hope Queen Khamira knows what to do with it."
"115740052-0-35564";"Could this really be the tomb of Khunzar-ri?"
"115740052-0-35566";"A sarcophagus. And a ghostly cat? Do you see it too, my friend?"
"115740052-0-35567";"I hope that contentious old mage is all right …."
"115740052-0-35569";"Five-claw! Did you and Sai Sahan find the hidden door?"
"115740052-0-35573";"Khenarthi. Please. He is a boy. He is our only boy …. If you must take someone, take me!"
"115740052-0-35574";"Please, Tuhada. You must get up."
"115740052-0-35575";"Vijari-ma, wake up! Vijari! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-35578";"Have no fear, Za'ji the Dragonslayer has arrived!"
"115740052-0-35579";"We're never going to hear the end of this …."
"115740052-0-35580";"Look! Above the ruins!"
"115740052-0-35581";"Our battle ends here, brother!"
"115740052-0-35582";"Nahfahlaar has fallen. We need to get into that keep."
"115740052-0-35583";"What am I going to tell my uncle? His moon-sugar, his guard, even my cat! All lost!"
"115740052-0-35584";"Welcome, dear friends, to the Jonelight Path, where heroes such as we can climb the liminal forces that bind each here to every there!"
"115740052-0-35587";"You … you are the Khunzar-ri!"
"115740052-0-35588";"Oh please, blood of my beloved. To his friends, this one is simply Zar. Now, cross the Jonelight Path and make your way to Dragonhold."
"115740052-0-35591";"One moment I was spending a nice evening with Maezi and Winks, the next those tuskless bastards were upon us."
"115740052-0-35592";"Turo? This was Turo's caravan? Daini, he'll kill us all for this!"
"115740052-0-35593";"Calm down, Antonia. Just come back to the house, yes? Daini will explain everything."
"115740052-0-35594";"I need to … maybe he'll go easy if I tell him what happened! Get away from me!"
"115740052-0-35596";"Of course, you did work with her, so … you see my dilemma. Business is business, Antonia. You understand, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-35597";"What? No! No! No!"
"115740052-0-35599";"That looks like Nahfahlaar, down below! Let's see if we can find a way to get to him."
"115740052-0-35600";"Hold a moment. There's some kind of message written on that tablet."
"115740052-0-35601";"That must be the Black Beast facing off against the Dragonguard. It looks like a Khajiiti warrior is leading them. Perhaps she was a member of the Pride of Alkosh?"
"115740052-0-35602";"The Khajiiti warrior from before. She claimed the Mask of Alkosh, just as you did. Wait. Could she possibly be Ja'darri?"
"115740052-0-35603";"That's Nahfahlaar. Ja'darri is offering him the Mask of Alkosh, but he's refusing her. It seems to symbolize something, though I'm not sure what."
"115740052-0-35605";"By Leki's Blade, I understand now. The Black Beast is Laatvulon! The Dragonguard sealed him away, though it cost Ja'darri her life. And Nahfahlaar is nowhere to be seen."
"115740052-0-35606";"Zoor drun qalos. Myth made manifest. A trick of the mask and nothing more."
"115740052-0-35607";"Come. Let us see what lies beyond the dunes."
"115740052-0-35609";"This is the spot. Where the liminal of here touches the liminal of there."
"115740052-0-35610";"Well, this is homey."
"115740052-0-35611";"Yes, Zar breaks his own rules. It is his nature, yes? Through this portal awaits the end of a tale that started long ago. Moons guide you, dear friends!"
"115740052-0-35612";"I am not some Crystal Tower sorcerer. I go where my research requires. This is the ideal environ to study Selene. That and your contribution are the only reason I'm still here."
"115740052-0-35613";"High Elf living in a cave. I can see why you required so much compensation."
"115740052-0-35614";"My study is just through these ruins. You will find Selene there."
"115740052-0-35615";"Winks!"
"115740052-0-35616";"You found my dagger! My brother, Avreg, gave it to me before I left Wrothgar."
"115740052-0-35617";"Looks like they dropped one of the sacks. So, not a total loss …."
"115740052-0-35618";"That sound … did you hear that?"
"115740052-0-35619";"Time grows short, hunter. What have you learned?"
"115740052-0-35620";"If you encounter Laatvulon, do not attempt to fight him. Our alliance ends the moment you die."
"115740052-0-35621";"Of course! This one will heroically play messenger."
"115740052-0-35622";"Za'ji does not often say this, but … be careful, yes? The situation does not sound so good."
"115740052-0-35623";"I don't see Nartise. Let's move on."
"115740052-0-35624";"No sign of the Dark Elf here. Let's head north."
"115740052-0-35625";"My old friend! Kasura sent word of your imminent arrival. Welcome back to the Abbey of Blades."
"115740052-0-35627";"Ah, she's awake. I wondered how long it would take before you showed yourself, Changeling. Shall we dance?"
"115740052-0-35630";"I must aid the wizard or the explosion will destroy everything."
"115740052-0-35631";"Moons take you, Tharn! I suppose I have to try …."
"115740052-0-35632";"Jode give me … strength …. There! Hurry, my friends, into the portal!"
"115740052-0-35633";"Use this glyph to root out the blight from your body! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-35634";"Who are you? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-35635";"I will do what I can, mage."
"115740052-0-35636";"Carindon! No! I won't let you break our agreement!"
"115740052-0-35637";"Damn it. I hope we aren't too late."
"115740052-0-35638";"Who dares attempt to stop my ascension?"
"115740052-0-35639";"You think to stop the rise of the New Moon? Never!"
"115740052-0-35640";"The flow of power has ceased! I will destroy whoever dares interfere with my ascension!"
"115740052-0-35642";"Come to witness my ascension, mortals?"
"115740052-0-35643";"Rest, dii zeymah. Your battle is done."
"115740052-0-35644";"<purr meow>"
"115740052-0-35645";"What is it, Winks? What are you trying to tell us?"
"115740052-0-35646";"<Meow meow>"
"115740052-0-35647";"I have returned and I bring the Dragonhorn. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-35648";"Winks, can you take us to Maezi?"
"115740052-0-35649";"Laatvulon underestimated you, hunter. He shall not do so again."
"115740052-0-35651";"And our children? What of them?"
"115740052-0-35652";"I do not know."
"115740052-0-35653";"We must know! There's no work in Senchal. How will we feed them?"
"115740052-0-35654";"We can't go back home, dearest. There's nothing left."
"115740052-0-35655";"I know! I … I'm scared. I don't want the children to starve."
"115740052-0-35656";"Don't look down … don't look down …."
"115740052-0-35658";"Come, mortals. Let me taste your blood. One last drink before I complete my ascension."
"115740052-0-35659";"Pahba-dra speaks true! The Dragons fought each other."
"115740052-0-35660";"Your eyes aren't what they used to be, grandmother."
"115740052-0-35661";"This one knows what she saw. Our village wasn't attacked! It was just in their way."
"115740052-0-35662";"But why would they fight each other?"
"115740052-0-35663";"This one does not know. But the thought frightens her."
"115740052-0-35664";"If the Dragons fight each other, they aren't eating us. Sounds good to me."
"115740052-0-35665";"None of this sounds good. None of it."
"115740052-0-35666";"Well, at least it can't get any worse."
"115740052-0-35667";"Whatever you need, Selene. We'll support you."
"115740052-0-35668";"Mask-bearer, don the Mask of Alkosh and fill it with the energy of the creatures of dark aeon. It will protect you and the others from my fire."
"115740052-0-35669";"Look out! It's got friends!"
"115740052-0-35672";"I'd forgotten how thrilling cavorting with your kind can be! I hope you can keep up!"
"115740052-0-35673";"Well done, Nahfahlaar. I am glad you decided to fly to the island once the aegis fell."
"115740052-0-35674";"Portals. You enter first and emerge last. Even time refuses to work correctly around such magic. Come, Queen Khamira and Nahfahlaar are up ahead."
"115740052-0-35675";"Unbind me, warlock!"
"115740052-0-35676";"There! That shard of aeonstone! Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-35677";"It appears our efforts have displeased Kaalgrontiid. Good."
"115740052-0-35678";"Then let us press the advantage while we have it!"
"115740052-0-35679";"I think we really hurt him! This crazy plan might actually work!"
"115740052-0-35680";"We're cleansing all of this corruption, that includes its source."
"115740052-0-35681";"He deserves the worst you can do, warlock, but I won't give you the satisfaction."
"115740052-0-35682";"Your confidence is heartening. We've driven Maarselok back to his lair, but the battle will not be finished until the Dragon is dead, or ensnared."
"115740052-0-35684";"There! Another focal point!"
"115740052-0-35685";"These ruins … could they be part of the complex you explored with Tharn?"
"115740052-0-35686";"If Tharn still lives, he could have taken refuge inside."
"115740052-0-35687";"We'll find him, Queen Khamira. I've seen Tharn survive worse things than a floating island."
"115740052-0-35688";"Moons help him, but I suspect Tharn has more to worry about than the floating island."
"115740052-0-35689";"The focal point should be just up ahead."
"115740052-0-35690";"Ugh, that stench! This must be where Bahzahar's hiding. Come, walker. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-35691";"That was the last of the focal points. Now to deal with Kaalgrontiid."
"115740052-0-35692";"As you say, Queen Khamira."
"115740052-0-35693";"Another obstacle? It won't stop us."
"115740052-0-35694";"I sense something up ahead …."
"115740052-0-35695";"By the Moons … is that Tharn?"
"115740052-0-35696";"Are you up to this, old man?"
"115740052-0-35697";"Don't concern yourself about me. Just remember, Kaalgrontiid is perched atop a gigantic shard of aeonstone that pulses with enough power to destroy the continent."
"115740052-0-35698";"Concentrate on … the task at hand."
"115740052-0-35699";"That door … Kaalgrontiid is through there."
"115740052-0-35700";"Over here, Dragonguard!"
"115740052-0-35701";"Prepare yourself! I'm going to blow the horn!"
"115740052-0-35702";"Our first trial. Looks like we'll have to find a way across."
"115740052-0-35703";"That ladder, it should be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-35704";"Whatever you did, it worked! The door just opened. I'll meet you on the other side."
"115740052-0-35708";"Honoria … Honoria and her damned toys! Did you clutch this as a child? I … I have to try. Damn you for leaving me, Honoria. Damn you!"
"115740052-0-35709";"I sewed that doll with my own hands. A gift for our child—for Jano's child. He never suspected that I bore his daughter in my womb. Too busy. Always too busy."
"115740052-0-35710";"The ritual … the soul binding. I couldn't risk the life of our child on a spell like that. So I left. Damn my cowardice … I left without saying goodbye. But now, we can make things right."
"115740052-0-35711";"Sai Sahan went on ahead. Tell him about the Clan Mother while I get this one back on his feet."
"115740052-0-35713";"My diary wasn't enough. If he had just read it, he would have known why I left. For once, Jano, I wish you would have pried."
"115740052-0-35714";"I know you always valued your privacy, Honoria. Maybe this will be enough …. Your worries, your joys. Your secret desires. Another legionary fell ill today. It has to be enough."
"115740052-0-35715";"I can still do this, with or without Honoria. I just need objects she treasured. She polished this sword once a fortnight. It will work. It has to."
"115740052-0-35716";"He worked so hard, but he forgot a critical point. The item had to bind us together. The two of us. Gods, I'm so sorry, Jano …."
"115740052-0-35719";"This scrapes no scales off my back, Selloe. I am not the one with the fussy mistress. Good luck. You will need it, I think."
"115740052-0-35722";"No, no don't bring a monkey …. That wasn't a banana!"
"115740052-0-35723";"Ah, yeah, here we go. Looks like he dropped a bottle over here."
"115740052-0-35724";"I see you've brought more torturers to dissect me, warlock."
"115740052-0-35725";"This one knew mother could read, but he never saw her write. How does she hold the quill?"
"115740052-0-35727";"I know, I know. I just wish we'd gotten there sooner."
"115740052-0-35728";"There's nothing you could have done."
"115740052-0-35729";"Let's look for more of these bottles, eh? He can't have gotten far."
"115740052-0-35730";"We need to hit the big bells in the same order as the little bells. They should be around here somewhere."
"115740052-0-35731";"I'll meet you outside the palace after I wash the stink of dead Dragon out of my armor."
"115740052-0-35732";"The stink. You get used to it."
"115740052-0-35733";"Ugh."
"115740052-0-35735";"Ugh. Think you could have found something a little tighter? Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-35736";"Yeah, I'm the, uh … the token guy. Lady G sent me to deliver this."
"115740052-0-35737";"Ah, Lady Ghisiliane! I just love how she shortens her name like that. Lends an air of mystery, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-35738";"Yeah, she's definitely mysterious, that Lady G. Anyways, sorry for the delay on your trinket there. You, uh … you all set for her party? Or whatever?"
"115740052-0-35739";"Trinket? Ha! You scallywag. It's so much more than a trinket! This event … it's so classy. So exclusive! I even bought a new bow for the occasion!"
"115740052-0-35740";"A new bow, eh? Yeah … I mean, everybody at the event should have a bow. I guess."
"115740052-0-35743";"This one understands. Thank you for your time, general."
"115740052-0-35745";"Good work! Now let's see if we can find that mask."
"115740052-0-35747";"Nahfahlaar … he's gone?"
"115740052-0-35749";"Vijari, it is time, love."
"115740052-0-35753";"How can I get any work done with these constant interruptions?"
"115740052-0-35754";"You? Maybe I'll mount your head on my wall!"
"115740052-0-35755";"We're coming, walker! Good work."
"115740052-0-35756";"Ranza! You followed that black robed ziss to a house, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-35757";"Don't worry, little one. I'll protect you from the big, bad cultist."
"115740052-0-35758";"Not so loud, Caska! What if the recruiter is still here?"
"115740052-0-35760";"We? Ah, you brought a friend! Come, friend of Caska. Introduce yourself."
"115740052-0-35761";"Ah, the Dragonguard's finest! Let us talk."
"115740052-0-35768";"Just buy another ship? Caska, you wound Za'ji! You truly do!"
"115740052-0-35771";"This one begins her exorcism! Help her purge Dak'radhi from this place!"
"115740052-0-35772";"Sliding stones! Caska told me about these. You move them onto panels to unlock gates."
"115740052-0-35773";"You did so well, dearest friend!"
"115740052-0-35775";"And that is a story that Khunzar-ri cannot wait to hear!"
"115740052-0-35776";"For the world is a sadder place without its heroes or its stories. Farewell, dear friend!"
"115740052-0-35777";"Look at that! Old rot-mouth actually kept the bell."
"115740052-0-35778";"Ah, it is good to be home!"
"115740052-0-35779";"We should sail for Senchal before reinforcements arrive."
"115740052-0-35780";"Excellent point. Hey, walker! Get us out of here!"
"115740052-0-35782";"If you attempt to enthrall them, I won't hesitate to bind you and find a less bothersome place to study you."
"115740052-0-35783";"I told you the captain would get the Pounce back!"
"115740052-0-35784";"Admiral! So good to finally meet you."
"115740052-0-35785";"Prepare yourselves!"
"115740052-0-35786";"No harm? Did we come all this way for nothing?"
"115740052-0-35787";"Hold. This Dragon means us no harm."
"115740052-0-35788";"That's still to be determined. For now, let's spread out and see what we can find."
"115740052-0-35789";"More crates. Hurry and check them, walker. I thought I heard someone approaching."
"115740052-0-35790";"Shh! Someone is coming. Hide, quickly!"
"115740052-0-35792";"Save it for the Dragon! Keep moving."
"115740052-0-35793";"Kill this abomination and I'll choke Maarselok on his own corruption!"
"115740052-0-35794";"Ignore him. I feel better already."
"115740052-0-35795";"Go. Protect Selene! We'll give her everything we have!"
"115740052-0-35796";"He's much stronger here. He's trying to wrest control of Selene!"
"115740052-0-35797";"Hurry! Finish this before Maarselok corrupts anyone else!"
"115740052-0-35798";"Hey! Hey! Let's not sour our victory!"
"115740052-0-35799";"Run, Selene!"
"115740052-0-35800";"Weak-willed fools! She's made you her puppets! Let me go!"
"115740052-0-35801";"You aren't going anywhere, Carindon. The Arch-Mage wants a word with you."
"115740052-0-35802";"And you've brought an audience! How fun!"
"115740052-0-35803";"Unwise. I shall loosen my hold only."
"115740052-0-35804";"I've had enough of you insects. For now."
"115740052-0-35805";"It's not every day that Captain Sai Sahan graces my office."
"115740052-0-35806";"Greetings, general. I am here to request a ship to hunt down a nearby Dragon."
"115740052-0-35807";"Slay a Dragon? And this from a man who couldn't even protect our emperor?"
"115740052-0-35810";"Perhaps you should speak to my companion. They can share the details of our plan."
"115740052-0-35812";"Ja'darri. I …."
"115740052-0-35813";"Apologies never did suit you, Nahfahlaar. You are here now. That is all that matters."
"115740052-0-35814";"Go no farther, vermin!"
"115740052-0-35815";"Who guides us to our destiny?"
"115740052-0-35816";"Ra'khajin, Lord of Night."
"115740052-0-35817";"Who protects us from destruction?"
"115740052-0-35818";"The Dragons and their might."
"115740052-0-35819";"Very good. Now, off to the ritual chamber. Lord Laatvulon is waiting."
"115740052-0-35820";"Step forward, initiates. Your trials await."
"115740052-0-35823";"Move along, initiates. Trial Master Zayri awaits you inside."
"115740052-0-35825";"As for our other initiate, you'll take a separate path. Head to the door on your left."
"115740052-0-35826";"What? Why can't we go together?"
"115740052-0-35827";"I'll get the boat ready to leave. Meet me there when you find them."
"115740052-0-35828";"The cultists use the aeonstone to empower Laatvulon. We must hurry!"
"115740052-0-35829";"The time has come, Ahkahtuz. Cleave through your enemies with the might of Alkosh!"
"115740052-0-35834";"Hmm. Stolen pottery? Too cumbersome. Let us keep looking, yes?"
"115740052-0-35835";"Vijari! He's caught in the dance! Stop him, we must get him away from here!"
"115740052-0-35836";"Books? Daini doubts Turo even knows how to read. Hmm. No rare titles. Leave them."
"115740052-0-35837";"Torval spirits? Mara knows Sormund's crew drinks enough already. There has to be something else around here."
"115740052-0-35838";"Ah, the door to the cellar. Papa always kept the most valuable goods down there. Let's have a look."
"115740052-0-35839";"Look at Winks go! Follow that cat!"
"115740052-0-35840";"Smugglers! You did it, Winks! Good kitty!"
"115740052-0-35841";"The time has come, Laatvulon. Our battle shall end here."
"115740052-0-35842";"If you aren't a smuggler, this one would appreciate being set free."
"115740052-0-35843";"Ka'ishka … Adara'hai must speak with our friend."
"115740052-0-35844";"Dak'radhi is close. She can feel the darkness pouring out of him!"
"115740052-0-35845";"Go! Strike the bell! She will hold him firm!"
"115740052-0-35847";"Strike that bell and you kill all Dak'radhi has left!"
"115740052-0-35848";"No! Vijari-ma! Vijari! Don't leave Dak'radhi! Don't leave him alone!"
"115740052-0-35849";"I know not how these mortals revived you, but they shall not do so again!"
"115740052-0-35850";"Maezi does not know what these bastards did with our moon-sugar. Maybe you could look around while this one checks on her friend?"
"115740052-0-35851";"Maezi! Winks and I were so worried! I see you met our friend."
"115740052-0-35852";"This one is pleased to see you as well, Zhasim. While your friend finds the stolen moon-sugar, we must hurry to Senchal!"
"115740052-0-35853";"What a good idea, Zhasim! If we sell to merchants here in Senchal, we can turn a much faster profit for your uncle."
"115740052-0-35854";"My … er, this one's uncle will finalize the ongoing contract. This exclusive arrangement for our gourmet moon-sugar will benefit us all."
"115740052-0-35855";"This one is pleased! We look forward to being the only distributor of your gourmet moon-sugar in all of Pellitine!"
"115740052-0-35856";"Tiresome mortals, submit to my reign and you may yet serve me!"
"115740052-0-35857";"You did it, Zhasim!"
"115740052-0-35859";"Uncle, we sold your moon-sugar and negotiated an exclusive trade agreement!"
"115740052-0-35860";"I am your foe! You shall face me."
"115740052-0-35865";"Your blood will be in the next batch!"
"115740052-0-35866";"Who … who goes there?"
"115740052-0-35868";"More intruders? Marvelous. On your feet, my sweet boy. Smash them for mother, won't you?"
"115740052-0-35869";"You dare kill my pets? My sweet boy? You'll pay soon enough …."
"115740052-0-35870";"I told you, I'm waiting for someone. And here they come now."
"115740052-0-35871";"We need to determine individual worth. Unless you'd rather admit defeat …."
"115740052-0-35872";"Fine. We'll do it your way."
"115740052-0-35873";"The bear-woman! She's here! She's—"
"115740052-0-35874";"Orkey take you, witch-scum. You there! Kyne's breath, it's good to see a friendly face …."
"115740052-0-35875";"I heard her! She's this way!"
"115740052-0-35876";"Damn it! We can't talk here. Keep moving! I'll find you. Go!"
"115740052-0-35877";"Take a breath, Ka'ishka, before you faint. What do you mean he's gone to Khenarthi? Has he … passed? I came as quickly as I could."
"115740052-0-35878";"If it was Khenarthi who took him I would be relieved! There is something wrong at the Wall of Life. Unclean. I fear it will snatch him from her tender embrace!"
"115740052-0-35879";"Ugh—too close, walker. Vijari is not a Lost Cat yet, but Adara'hai must begin the exorcism. She'll take him home, meet her there. She will need you."
"115740052-0-35880";"Enough of your mewling! These slow-witted Nords pose little threat."
"115740052-0-35881";"I knew this ritual would bring trouble. Your new patron asks too much of us!"
"115740052-0-35882";"Look here. More of them! Stay out of my way, Hiti."
"115740052-0-35883";"I do as I please, sister!"
"115740052-0-35884";"Skelga? Skelga! You … I'll burn you to cinders for this!"
"115740052-0-35885";"Skelga! The bear-woman! She's—"
"115740052-0-35886";"Skelga?"
"115740052-0-35887";"Shor's bones, there's no end to these hag-born bastards!"
"115740052-0-35888";"I'm glad to see you in one piece. Our initial assault … it didn't go well. I saved who I could, but these witches are dug in like hoarvors."
"115740052-0-35889";"Hmm. You found an altar? Maybe the witches left some reagents, or scrolls, or something."
"115740052-0-35890";"Disgusting intruders! I won't have it. I will not have it!"
"115740052-0-35891";"Laatvulon is weakening! Strike now!"
"115740052-0-35892";"Filthy, disgusting interlopers! You think summoning is all I can do?"
"115740052-0-35893";"Can't a Khajiit nap in peace?"
"115740052-0-35894";"Why not come down and show us, hag?"
"115740052-0-35895";"Brought a beast of your own, eh? She'll die soon enough. You all will!"
"115740052-0-35896";"Cowardly witch!"
"115740052-0-35897";"We've got them on the back foot. Let's keep the pressure on. Come on!"
"115740052-0-35899";"Good, good. The aeonstones hum with energy."
"115740052-0-35900";"Stay down, witch-scum! Come on, we're getting close to the ritual, I know it."
"115740052-0-35901";"So simple, is it? Arise, and fight on, champion!"
"115740052-0-35902";"Lady Bebbia, it is done. Khajiit of the Moons is whole again."
"115740052-0-35903";"Finally, this one's dreams have been made real. Thanks to you both."
"115740052-0-35904";"Perhaps I'll put that on my sign. Percius Loche: Dreamweaver."
"115740052-0-35905";"You've mended more than dreams, Percius. This is hope. For all of Senchal."
"115740052-0-35906";"Khajiit of the Moons will be the cornerstone of a new Senchal, risen from the ashes."
"115740052-0-35907";"If you're in need of new fashion for this new Senchal, it would be my honor to design it."
"115740052-0-35908";"You seek the mask? Very well. My champion awaits."
"115740052-0-35909";"So confident … so proud. You have no idea what kinds of forces you're meddling with."
"115740052-0-35910";"Think you can lock me out? I'll knock that pretty head clean off your shoulders!"
"115740052-0-35911";"Promises, promises. When our ally spreads his wings over the world, you'll lose so much more than your heads."
"115740052-0-35912";"Damn these crones …."
"115740052-0-35913";"Come on. The ritual site can't be much farther."
"115740052-0-35914";"I completed a circuit of the island, queen of cats. As expected, Kaalgrontiid has set up aeonstone focal points to enhance his energy."
"115740052-0-35915";"Damn it! Reinforcements! I'll hold off the Reachmen as long as I can. You kill those witches!"
"115740052-0-35916";"Well look there. We have a guest."
"115740052-0-35917";"Have you not taken enough?"
"115740052-0-35918";"Give Dak'radhi his son!"
"115740052-0-35919";"Vijari belongs with us!"
"115740052-0-35920";"Dak'radhi can take his pain away!"
"115740052-0-35921";"Vijari …!"
"115740052-0-35922";"Seems there's more to Pridehome than we thought."
"115740052-0-35924";"Quick, walker! Get to the Clan Mother. We'll watch your back."
"115740052-0-35925";"You can count on us!"
"115740052-0-35926";"Look. Above us. Nahfahlaar! He decided to show up, after all."
"115740052-0-35927";"Vengeance means little to the dead, Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-35928";"Seek the mask if you wish. I will deal with Laatvulon."
"115740052-0-35929";"The Clan Mother?"
"115740052-0-35930";"We were too late. She's dead."
"115740052-0-35931";"How could Ra'khajin do this? Hizuni was a mother to him. To both of us."
"115740052-0-35932";"Fate will catch up with Ra'khajin eventually. We'll avenge—"
"115740052-0-35933";"Good, you found the place. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-35934";"That's the wrong way. If you have something else to do, by all means. I'll meet up with you later."
"115740052-0-35935";"Just as Queen Khamira said. A door hidden behind a waterfall!"
"115740052-0-35936";"Were you successful, my friend? I fear without the restored tablet we won't open this door."
"115740052-0-35937";"Pardon the intrusion, Clan Mother, but … we bring distressing news."
"115740052-0-35938";"You speak of Pridehome, yes? And the death of Hizuni."
"115740052-0-35939";"A moment? Yes, but only that."
"115740052-0-35940";"This one heard whispers on the wind. May Khenarthi carry her to sweeter sands."
"115740052-0-35941";"Now, accept this final gift. A quick path back to your kra'jun. That is where this story truly begins!"
"115740052-0-35942";"You already know?"
"115740052-0-35943";"General Renmus and the Shields will protect Senchal. If we can't assault Dragonhold, we'll direct our efforts to supporting the Shields."
"115740052-0-35944";"If this Kaalgrontiid actually exists, how can either the Shields or the Dragonguard hope to stand against it?"
"115740052-0-35945";"Just trust us, father. I swear, we won't let you down."
"115740052-0-35946";"Need some help, walker? I'll join you on this hunt."
"115740052-0-35947";"Into the bay? Really? I think the ghost cat did that on purpose!"
"115740052-0-35949";"Bring the claw to Queen Khamira while I rally the Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-35950";"Ah, the castaways. Pity you had to come all this way only to die at our hands. Come sisters. Let's put an end to their sad tale."
"115740052-0-35952";"As for Auberic Dufont, he owns a residence not far from the inn. If you want a favorable introduction with Lady G, you won't keep Auberic waiting."
"115740052-0-35953";"Five-claw! I think I know what to do with Khunzar-ri's claw!"
"115740052-0-35954";"Dragonguard, defend Senchal until you hear from us. Five-claw, Sai, with me. Enter the portal!"
"115740052-0-35956";"Zurnash is a shameless drunk. You'll find him near the inn, no doubt."
"115740052-0-35957";"A single hoarvor? Honestly? This is an exclusive gathering for Senchal's elite, not a Goblin petting zoo."
"115740052-0-35958";"So good of you to return. Now let's find that door."
"115740052-0-35959";"That's the Wall?"
"115740052-0-35961";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-35962";"All dead? Damn …. I scattered their wicker-clad lackeys, but I really wanted a crack at those hags. Ah well."
"115740052-0-35963";"I heard them prattling on about some ally. A shadow partner of some kind?"
"115740052-0-35964";"Lord Laatvulon awaits! Give your power to him and you shall ascend!"
"115740052-0-35965";"Look here. They inscribed part of the ritual on this scroll … but just a part. Hmph. This might just be the beginning of something."
"115740052-0-35966";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-35967";"Ah, here come our newest members. Just in time."
"115740052-0-35968";"Walker! Over here."
"115740052-0-35969";"You did it! The bells are cleansed."
"115740052-0-35970";"Indeed, they are. Well done."
"115740052-0-35971";"Come, Dragonguard. Tadali must prepare you for the trials ahead."
"115740052-0-35973";"Why do you say it like that? Oh, you think the others would frown on a bow, don't you? I knew it. I just knew it! But a sword is so messy! Ugh, the swamp will be messy enough. Say, you're in the know. Have you been there?"
"115740052-0-35974";"What, the swamp? Yeah … all the time. But Lady G doesn't like us talking about it."
"115740052-0-35975";"More exciting if I don't know, eh? Ha! Classic Lady Ghisiliane. I heard her last event took place in a Daedric ruin. Can you imagine? But look at me, rambling on. Can I get you something before you leave? A beverage perhaps?"
"115740052-0-35976";"Yeah, sure. You got any rum? I'm going to level with you Ric—I can call you Ric, right? My palate ain't that sophisticated."
"115740052-0-35977";"Well, I was going to offer you some of my sour guar shein. Four sixty-seven. Very good year. But I suppose I can find some rum? Just give me a moment. It's probably somewhere behind the sujamma selection …."
"115740052-0-35978";"Got everything? Good. Mauloch's jawbone, I have got to get out of these clothes."
"115740052-0-35979";"Let's get out of here before he notices anything's missing. Follow me to the waterfront. We'll talk more there."
"115740052-0-35980";"Not a word of protest, eh? I see how it is. I'm just giving you a hard time. Tie me up and let's go."
"115740052-0-35981";"Best hurry while the product is most potent. And refrain from asking too many questions. My customers value their privacy."
"115740052-0-35982";"You are a terrible thief, Tender Claw. And with that eye patch, you do not even look like a proper lost kitten!"
"115740052-0-35983";"I told you to never mention my eye patch. It makes me self-conscious."
"115740052-0-35984";"Selloe. Obsequious as ever. Tell me, is ceruval Auberic appeased? And who might this be? With an Orc, no less?"
"115740052-0-35985";"A recent acquaintance, my lady. They handled matters with Auberic. Under my watchful eye, of course!"
"115740052-0-35987";"I'm sorry I left you when you needed me, my love. It was cowardly. But there's something I must tell you—the reason I fled."
"115740052-0-35988";"Lady Ghisiliane! Fivefold venerations, my lady!"
"115740052-0-35989";"Do you have any questions before we try this?"
"115740052-0-35990";"Come with me, Jano. Let me show you before we fade away."
"115740052-0-35991";"Mind the terrain and keep an eye out for the Orc. Dangerous prey, that one."
"115740052-0-35992";"Flee! The Orc—he's mad! Mad!"
"115740052-0-35993";"Bow lost, boots ruined! Lady G shall hear of this! I demand redress!"
"115740052-0-35994";"Ugh. Another trip to mother's temple."
"115740052-0-35995";"You here about the New Moon business? Shirnama's in the attic."
"115740052-0-35996";"Oh, no. I am not dealing with another one of your bouts of depression. Aeliah will go."
"115740052-0-35997";"I will? I mean, of course I will!"
"115740052-0-35998";"Oy! There you are. This way!"
"115740052-0-35999";"It's settled. You two will head to Khenarthi's temple and search for the mask."
"115740052-0-36000";"Help! Help me!"
"115740052-0-36001";"This way!"
"115740052-0-36002";"Their trail ends here."
"115740052-0-36003";"Finally! The pain has been killing me."
"115740052-0-36004";"That foul scent. I know these worms. You cannot stop me. This island will ascend and I shall become the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-36005";"Tell the herbalist. His debt is paid and his secret is safe."
"115740052-0-36006";"Joorahmaar! Protect the aegis!"
"115740052-0-36007";"The island shall rise and a new moon will be born!"
"115740052-0-36008";"I am the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-36009";"I will burn you to ash and cinders!"
"115740052-0-36010";"Infuriating insects! You dare defy the will of my master?"
"115740052-0-36011";"Are you the herbalist's courier? Come inside. Quickly."
"115740052-0-36012";"Your friend then? She's just through that door. It's locked, you see?"
"115740052-0-36013";"I stole the key and hid it. Here. I just need to …."
"115740052-0-36014";"Aw, again with the vomit?"
"115740052-0-36015";"Hircine rot your soul."
"115740052-0-36016";"Parched. Marekki is parched. I could really use a drink, Skordo."
"115740052-0-36017";"Funny, I was just thinking the same thing."
"115740052-0-36018";"No you weren't. You were thinking of going back into that swamp and killing all those other hunters."
"115740052-0-36019";"Bah! What are you? Some kind of witchy, mind-reading cat?"
"115740052-0-36020";"Oh, Skordo. You hide your thoughts like a teenage Dagi hides his smutty picture-books. Not well, I mean. You're bad at it."
"115740052-0-36021";"What? Ha! By Mauloch, what have I gotten myself into?"
"115740052-0-36022";"I'd almost think you were competent, Selloe. This Orc should provide a worthy challenge for my clients."
"115740052-0-36023";"Oh, uhm … yes, Lady Ghisiliane."
"115740052-0-36024";"First to the arena and ready to kill! It's the Red Rooks of Glenumbra!"
"115740052-0-36025";"Impressive! But let us see how you fare against the vicious Iron Orcs!"
"115740052-0-36026";"We're not done yet! Next up is some local favorites, the Ruddy Fangs of Elsweyr!"
"115740052-0-36027";"And for the last round, our arena champions! Do'mazir the Deadly and the roguish Jiren-dar!"
"115740052-0-36029";"Clan Mother Tadali said you had to find light in darkness. Why don't you try igniting the braziers?"
"115740052-0-36031";"You did it! I hope this is the last of these trials."
"115740052-0-36034";"Come on, the mask should be just ahead."
"115740052-0-36035";"Look! A gate opened. Now you just need to find the platform."
"115740052-0-36036";"We might need to move the same sliding stone to different panels. Don't forget this one up here!"
"115740052-0-36037";"That's a statue of Ja'darri, isn't it? Let's see if there's an inscription."
"115740052-0-36038";"Was that … Ja'darri?"
"115740052-0-36039";"Do you hear the beating of the heart? Namiira calls us, walkers!"
"115740052-0-36040";"I can feel it pounding in my skull. Can't you hear it?"
"115740052-0-36041";"Join us in the Dark Behind the World!"
"115740052-0-36042";"Namiira welcomes you! Join us in her darkness!"
"115740052-0-36043";"This is where it happened."
"115740052-0-36044";"Our lives for the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-36045";"I took the liberty of clearing our route. Just watch where you step."
"115740052-0-36046";"Nephew! This one came as soon as he got the message from Maezi."
"115740052-0-36047";"Uncle, I want to talk to you about another opportunity …."
"115740052-0-36048";"You did well, Zhasim. This one wants to hear all about your ideas for the business."
"115740052-0-36051";"No need to travel to Senchal, Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-36052";"General Renmus."
"115740052-0-36053";"I owe all of you an apology. I thought I acted for the good of Senchal, but there is blood on my hands."
"115740052-0-36054";"If you'll have us, the Shields of Senchal will fight alongside the Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-36055";"We've always been on the same side. I'm glad you finally realized that."
"115740052-0-36056";"If not for them, you'd be in a gutter, or buried in a pile of potato sacks more likely. What did you do this time?"
"115740052-0-36057";"Ow! Hey! I said carry me home, not toss me!"
"115740052-0-36059";"Find them! Do not let them escape!"
"115740052-0-36060";"Keep going!"
"115740052-0-36061";"I can't believe it! We actually fought a living, breathing Dragon!"
"115740052-0-36062";"It's not breathing any more!"
"115740052-0-36063";"Caska, Za'ji. You're with me."
"115740052-0-36064";"Looks like they're headed straight to Doomstone Keep. Huh. What could they want with that old ruin?"
"115740052-0-36065";"Fine. I shall make my way to Pridehome. For the sake of our alliance."
"115740052-0-36066";"Horse Neigh SFX, no VO"
"115740052-0-36067";"Khenarthi's sweet winds, Lorkhaj's black heart! Light to follow and darkness to thwart!"
"115740052-0-36068";"Cunning and strength, virtue and pride! May they prove worthy of mask divine!"
"115740052-0-36070";"The way is opened. And so Tadali's part in this ends. It is up to you now, Dragonguard."
"115740052-0-36071";"Let's do this!"
"115740052-0-36072";"I know a hunt when I see one, walker. Find Nahfahlaar before they overwhelm him."
"115740052-0-36073";"Finally, a chance to defeat Caska the Unconquered! Do'mazir has been waiting for this."
"115740052-0-36074";"What are we going to do now?"
"115740052-0-36075";"Without reinforcements, we have no way to take the keep."
"115740052-0-36076";"As long as the Dragonguard still stand, there is always a way."
"115740052-0-36077";"Quickly, get the gate open while this one frees her brother. Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-36078";"Stay sharp. We don't know what might lurk in these caverns."
"115740052-0-36079";"What a nightmare! Daini, say we are leaving?"
"115740052-0-36080";"Yes little brother, we are going far, far away. Let's get on the boat. Come."
"115740052-0-36081";"Sep's scales, this gate won't budge. Does anyone see a lever?"
"115740052-0-36082";"Hold your positions!"
"115740052-0-36083";"That was certainly effective. Well done, my friend!"
"115740052-0-36084";"Good to see you, warrior! Thanks for the assistance."
"115740052-0-36085";"Damn this gate!"
"115740052-0-36086";"Inside, now! Follow the beast!"
"115740052-0-36087";"Look, above us! The Dragon!"
"115740052-0-36088";"It is time, Ra'khajin. Sahrot sul. Show me your worth."
"115740052-0-36089";"As you wish, my master."
"115740052-0-36090";"I shall claim my birthright!"
"115740052-0-36091";"As the New Moon rises, I shall rise with it!"
"115740052-0-36092";"The mask is my destiny!"
"115740052-0-36093";"Laatvulon, help me!"
"115740052-0-36094";"Master, lend me your power!"
"115740052-0-36095";"It can't end like this! Laatvulon!"
"115740052-0-36097";"In a rather roundabout way, it seems like this tablet is telling us how to move forward."
"115740052-0-36098";"There. Let's see if the mask responds to that brazier."
"115740052-0-36099";"It will bring him a good dinner and new tunic. This one thanks you for your patronage."
"115740052-0-36100";"What took you so long?"
"115740052-0-36101";"What is that green stone they're mining? I've never seen anything like it."
"115740052-0-36103";"He's turning Yahgrondu into some sort of monster! We have to stop him!"
"115740052-0-36104";"Uninvited guests? Well, I can always use more slaves."
"115740052-0-36105";"You'll beg for the shackles before I'm through!"
"115740052-0-36106";"Look now, you're scaring the poor slaves!"
"115740052-0-36107";"Do something you cowards! Help your master!"
"115740052-0-36108";"You are leaving? Be quick! I will be here when you return."
"115740052-0-36109";"A new champion walks in Ja'darri's stead. We can still make things right."
"115740052-0-36110";"Daini is here! Quick, let us discuss strategy."
"115740052-0-36111";"Our strength is now one, Ahkahtuz. Let us finish this!"
"115740052-0-36112";"I am with you, my champion!"
"115740052-0-36113";"Suleyki hin!"
"115740052-0-36114";"Very well."
"115740052-0-36115";"You are no champion, Ra'khajin."
"115740052-0-36116";"When Flinthild sobered, she thought better of her plan. Did she see Khunzar-ri differently without a head full of mead? Perhaps. Or perhaps there was another reason."
"115740052-0-36117";"I was to be … the New Moon's Mane …."
"115740052-0-36118";"They say that Khunzar-ri found him much later, under much different circumstances. But that is a story for another time."
"115740052-0-36119";"There are many theories, but even Khunzar-ri could not say for certain. He said he felt as though he was being folded, and suddenly found himself next to Anequina again."
"115740052-0-36120";"We can reach the surface this way. Let's move out!"
"115740052-0-36121";"To the shame of us all. He saved everyone in Elsweyr, but who was there to save him?"
"115740052-0-36122";"I will have to kill you myself."
"115740052-0-36123";"Sweets were her only vice. A vice the tribes of Elsweyr share to this day."
"115740052-0-36124";"Perhaps. Or perhaps a covetous friend got sick of his bragging. Stranger things have happened in Elsweyr."
"115740052-0-36125";"Even if this one knew, she would not tell. Some secrets are best left buried."
"115740052-0-36126";"Even Moon-Singer Feziya-ko must rest her voice from time to time. Thank you for sharing our stories, friend. Moons guide you."
"115740052-0-36127";"Laatvulon!"
"115740052-0-36128";"Your fight is with me!"
"115740052-0-36129";"Father, excuse the interruption, but the ceremony is about to begin!"
"115740052-0-36130";"Perfect timing! And Aeliah, I've accepted Queen Khamira's offer. We shall help her reestablish the Elsweyr Confederacy."
"115740052-0-36131";"That's excellent news, father!"
"115740052-0-36132";"Senchal needs the Shields. And the Shields need the support of a monarch."
"115740052-0-36133";"Now come along. We need to get all of you to that ceremony!"
"115740052-0-36134";"As you say, father."
"115740052-0-36135";"A challenge? Very well, brother. Let us end this."
"115740052-0-36136";"Perfect timing! And Aeliah, I won't be accepting Queen Khamira's offer. It's time I returned home."
"115740052-0-36137";"You're leaving Senchal? Returning to Cyrodiil?"
"115740052-0-36138";"I've done all I can here. And you have the Dragonguard now. It's time I checked in on the Empire."
"115740052-0-36139";"We can discuss this later. We need to get all of you to the ceremony."
"115740052-0-36140";"Laatvulon! Your death approaches!"
"115740052-0-36141";"Did you hear? The Shields of Senchal joined with the Dragonguard!"
"115740052-0-36142";"The way this one hears it, they took down an entire fortress together. And killed a Dragon to boot!"
"115740052-0-36143";"You missed it, my friend! Caska the Unconquered made her return to the Black Kiergo."
"115740052-0-36144";"Ah, it was truly a sight to behold. Do you think she'll come back tonight?"
"115740052-0-36145";"This one heard the Black Kiergo is bloodier than ever lately. Want to go tonight, show a lady a good time?"
"115740052-0-36146";"Did you hear? Za'ji managed to steal the Perfect Pounce back."
"115740052-0-36147";"And he'll manage to lose it again within the week, this one bets."
"115740052-0-36148";"Did you hear? Some robed strangers just chartered a ship. Mighty mysterious."
"115740052-0-36149";"Mighty foolish, if you ask this one. Who's chartering a ship with all these Dragons about?"
"115740052-0-36150";"Now we're joining up with the Dragonguard? Where's the sense in that?"
"115740052-0-36151";"The order certainly proved themselves capable in Doomstone Keep, wouldn't you say?"
"115740052-0-36152";"But what about Senchal? Aren't we supposed to protect the city, first and foremost?"
"115740052-0-36153";"While the rest of Elsweyr burns in Dragonfire? If you ask me, it's about time we took the fight to those beasts."
"115740052-0-36154";"Rumor has it that someone infiltrated that New Moon Cult."
"115740052-0-36155";"Those loonies? Well, I just hope whoever infiltrated them stirred up some trouble. Those robed heathens could certainly use some."
"115740052-0-36156";"I can't believe it. Sai Sahan, reforming the Dragonguard! Can he even do that?"
"115740052-0-36157";"And who's going to tell him he can't?"
"115740052-0-36158";"Have you heard the rumors? Sai Sahan,  sailing with a crew of smugglers."
"115740052-0-36159";"Aye, and I'm the daughter of Dibella."
"115740052-0-36160";"It was him. I swear it. Sai Sahan, in the flesh! The last time anyone saw him was in the Imperial City!"
"115740052-0-36161";"Let's say you really did see him, and you aren't just drunk off your arse. Why would he come all the way out here?"
"115740052-0-36162";"I don't know, but it must be serious. He's a very serious looking person."
"115740052-0-36163";"She can't, Radhi. She has no strength left."
"115740052-0-36164";"Don't tell momma Vijari was playing in the fountain again."
"115740052-0-36165";"Come, Za'ji used to explore this place as a cub. He'll sniff out where Bahzahar is hiding."
"115740052-0-36166";"While Za'ji tracks, you will protect us, yes? This one must concentrate."
"115740052-0-36167";"That's it, five-claw! Show them what for!"
"115740052-0-36168";"She doesn't want you."
"115740052-0-36169";"Go before him, Dragonguard. It should only take a few words."
"115740052-0-36170";"Do you remember, Nahfahlaar? Words to mend the tapestry."
"115740052-0-36171";"Only it's shadow. We will brighten it again."
"115740052-0-36172";"Dragon King above. Bormahu han zu'u."
"115740052-0-36173";"This mortal is worthy. Wah vokrii krentiid. They shall mend your threads."
"115740052-0-36174";"The mask awakens. Go now. Harness the might of Alkosh to overcome the Demon from the East."
"115740052-0-36175";"As it was always meant to be."
"115740052-0-36176";"There's the alcove, but where's the ladder? Hmm. Walker, let's talk."
"115740052-0-36177";"You know. That Nahfahlaar fellow. He ain't too bad, yes? For a Dragon."
"115740052-0-36178";"Sleek! Za'ji knew you could do it!"
"115740052-0-36179";"Someone comes! Meet Za'ji by the door!"
"115740052-0-36180";"This one will drink to that."
"115740052-0-36181";"You found the key, yes?"
"115740052-0-36182";"Did you hear? The Dragon cult's leader is finally dead."
"115740052-0-36183";"The Dragon still lives, doesn't it? Let's not celebrate just yet."
"115740052-0-36184";"Word's out about the Dragonguard. Sidura said she's already had six people in Senchal ask about joining."
"115740052-0-36185";"Good. They can stand in front of this one when the fighting starts. He could use some cover."
"115740052-0-36186";"Did you hear? Another Dragon is set to join our alliance! We'll have an army at them at this rate."
"115740052-0-36187";"Ugh, as if one beast wasn't bad enough. Two Dragons means they're twice as likely to kill us."
"115740052-0-36188";"Never in all his years did this one think he would meet a friendly Dragon."
"115740052-0-36189";"Right, friendly. Until the beast gets hungry, that is."
"115740052-0-36190";"Dak'radhi will carry you! He will carry you to the Sands Behind the Stars himself if he has to! Just do not leave him yet."
"115740052-0-36191";"If it were her choice—"
"115740052-0-36192";"This one will get you water!"
"115740052-0-36193";"Radhi … Vijari …."
"115740052-0-36194";"Only a moment more! Vijari! Come help your mother!"
"115740052-0-36195";"She … she loves …."
"115740052-0-36196";"Tuhada!"
"115740052-0-36197";"I can hardly believe it. Za'ji, prince of the vagabonds, taking down a Dragon!"
"115740052-0-36198";"He's actually quite brave, once you get to know him."
"115740052-0-36199";"Oh? And just how well did you know him?"
"115740052-0-36200";"Oh, just about as well as anyone, I suspect."
"115740052-0-36201";"Clan Mother Tadali returns from Moons-know-where yet again. What do you think she gets up to?"
"115740052-0-36202";"What Khenarthi wills her to, I suspect. Is that not her purpose?"
"115740052-0-36203";"Hm. Then I suppose her many absences must be overlooked."
"115740052-0-36204";"Vul Tiid Yol!"
"115740052-0-36205";"Clan Mother Tadali's boy returned the bell that went missing. Such a shameful cub."
"115740052-0-36206";"Za'ji returned to Black Heights? Did he … mention me?"
"115740052-0-36207";"Why would he?"
"115740052-0-36208";"Hello there, hero. Have time for a chat?"
"115740052-0-36209";"Oh, no reason. No reason at all. There's certainly no reason he would mention me."
"115740052-0-36210";"They say outsiders are coming to Senchal to rebuild the Dragonguard. Have you ever heard of anything so preposterous?"
"115740052-0-36211";"Honestly, everything you say is preposterous."
"115740052-0-36212";"Fo Liz Strun!"
"115740052-0-36214";"Iiz Bah Strun"
"115740052-0-36215";"Oh no, Khenarthi, no no no no no. Not again."
"115740052-0-36216";"Stay upwind of Bahzahar. His rotten breath has been known to clear barnacles off a ship's hull!"
"115740052-0-36217";"Father? Wha—what's the matter?"
"115740052-0-36218";"Shh, shh. It's all right, Vijari. Papa is here. You fainted, but you're all right now."
"115740052-0-36219";"Hey! There goes our ride!"
"115740052-0-36220";"That's him, Bahzahar the Bull! Go get him, walker!"
"115740052-0-36222";"W—who's there?"
"115740052-0-36223";"She never wanted you."
"115740052-0-36225";"Shut up."
"115740052-0-36226";"Or your wretched wife."
"115740052-0-36227";"Shut up."
"115740052-0-36228";"Or your wretched son."
"115740052-0-36229";"Shut up!"
"115740052-0-36230";"She's forsaken you. But I haven't. There's a place in the Dark for all you cast off, forgotten souls."
"115740052-0-36231";"You—you will save Vijari-ma?"
"115740052-0-36232";"No, lonely creature. You will."
"115740052-0-36233";"It's late Vijari. You need to rest. This one will be finished soon."
"115740052-0-36234";"You said that last night."
"115740052-0-36235";"You've seen it too, yes? That island off the coast with the weird lights?"
"115740052-0-36236";"What do you suppose it is? Evil cultists? Dark mages?"
"115740052-0-36237";"We fought hard for this victory, Dragonguard. To save the people of Elsweyr, of all Tamriel, from Laatvulon's tyranny."
"115740052-0-36238";"But our battle does not end here. Like those who came before, we'll fight the Dragons that plague this land until the day that plague ends."
"115740052-0-36239";"And for all those who lost their lives today I say this prayer. May your flames burn eternal."
"115740052-0-36240";"The city's on edge. Damn that floating island! If the people riot, we don't have the forces to stop them."
"115740052-0-36241";"I think a riot is the least of our worries, don't you?"
"115740052-0-36242";"Tonight Dak'radhi will rest. He promises."
"115740052-0-36243";"Now that you mention it, let's just hope whatever it is stays far away from the city."
"115740052-0-36244";"I heard the general talking. The Dragonguard and the Queen of Rimmen destroyed the sky island!"
"115740052-0-36245";"The Dragonguard? Again? Next thing you know, their won't be any work for the Shields!"
"115740052-0-36246";"Goodnight, father."
"115740052-0-36247";"Goodnight, son."
"115740052-0-36248";"Another ship went down. Got too close to that island off the southern coast."
"115740052-0-36249";"Mark this one's words, that island just isn't right!"
"115740052-0-36250";"Papa will not be gone forever."
"115740052-0-36251";"Dak'radhi brought what you asked."
"115740052-0-36252";"An island in the sky! What could it mean?"
"115740052-0-36253";"Daedra? Necromancers? This one just knows she won't be sailing anywhere near the place!"
"115740052-0-36255";"The island fell out of the sky! They say it was the Dragonguard!"
"115740052-0-36256";"The Dragonguard? We should definitely buy the drinks next time we see them!"
"115740052-0-36257";"Sai Sahan's acting like it's the end of the world."
"115740052-0-36258";"Probably the beard. That much facial hair has to agitate a person."
"115740052-0-36259";"Infuriating fleas! How dare you attempt to stop the rise of the Dark Aeon!"
"115740052-0-36260";"Did you hear? An entire island floated clear into the sky!"
"115740052-0-36261";"Have you been sneaking into Za'ji's plum brandy supply again?"
"115740052-0-36262";"You cannot turn the tide of prophecy, mortals!"
"115740052-0-36263";"Just the warrior I wanted to speak to."
"115740052-0-36264";"Is it true? Did the sky island fall? And is the wizard Tharn really … dead?"
"115740052-0-36265";"There's only one thing to do. Let's drink to his memory. Excessively!"
"115740052-0-36266";"That woman, Khamira. Turns out she's the blooming queen of Rimmen!"
"115740052-0-36267";"The queen of Rimmen? Damn it all, I should have had her buy the drinks!"
"115740052-0-36268";"This one attended the ceremony to honor the Dragonguard. Quite impressive!"
"115740052-0-36269";"How come we never get a ceremony? This one caught seven fish yesterday!"
"115740052-0-36270";"Did you see that ceremony for the Dragonguard? Very impressive!"
"115740052-0-36271";"I'm just happy that the Shields still have a job. I wonder what it will be like working for the Queen of Rimmen?"
"115740052-0-36272";"This way! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-36273";"We must aid Nahfahlaar! Dragonguard, to me!"
"115740052-0-36274";"Have you no more corpses to call upon, Laatvulon?"
"115740052-0-36275";"I need only my own might to defeat you!"
"115740052-0-36276";"Now, little mask-bearer. Let us see how you handle my true might!"
"115740052-0-36278";"Our father's power strengthens me! I will not be so easily defeated."
"115740052-0-36279";"We shall see about that!"
"115740052-0-36280";"Have no fear! Za'ji has arrived!"
"115740052-0-36281";"We'll handle this rabble!"
"115740052-0-36282";"Laatvulon's corruption is getting stronger!"
"115740052-0-36283";"We'll cover you! Protect Nahfahlaar!"
"115740052-0-36284";"Enough of this!"
"115740052-0-36285";"I should have killed you long ago, mask-bearer!"
"115740052-0-36286";"There's too many of them! We can't hold them off!"
"115740052-0-36287";"Continue to protect Nahfahlaar! I'll join the others."
"115740052-0-36288";"You think you can win? I am unslaad! You cannot end me!"
"115740052-0-36289";"It has already begun! My death will change nothing!"
"115740052-0-36291";"Your life ends here. Pruzah wundunne!"
"115740052-0-36292";"A hollow victory, mask-bearer. The New Moon … shall rise …."
"115740052-0-36293";"Well fought, Dragonguard. Laatvulon is slain. Now I shall ensure that nothing remains."
"115740052-0-36294";"Pour it all into your art."
"115740052-0-36295";"Blood of a flightless bird."
"115740052-0-36296";"Too terrible and ugly for Khenarthi's sky."
"115740052-0-36297";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"115740052-0-36298";"Numbing dreams are as close as you'll come."
"115740052-0-36299";"The skin of her fallen children."
"115740052-0-36300";"Torn down by her own wind and claws."
"115740052-0-36301";"Come, my lost cat. Paint your mark for me and we'll dance on Khenarthi's graves."
"115740052-0-36302";"Thank you! Thank you for bringing him back."
"115740052-0-36303";"What kind of stupid name for a ship is Cat Gut anyway?"
"115740052-0-36304";"An offensive one."
"115740052-0-36305";"Let's hear your idea then, smart-guy."
"115740052-0-36306";"When I get my own ship, I'm gonna call it the Sea Cad! Sounds pirate-y, right? Hey! Quit laughing!"
"115740052-0-36307";"You don't feel guilty? Raiding your own kind?"
"115740052-0-36308";"Would you ask that of another Man?"
"115740052-0-36309";"Nobody asks me if I mind robbing Orcs."
"115740052-0-36310";"Well, excuse me for asking."
"115740052-0-36311";"Why are you serving on a ship like the Cat Gut anyway? Ain't there Khajiit pirates you'd rather sail with?"
"115740052-0-36312";"Khajiit would have signed on to the Perfect Pounce, but Captain Za'ji said this one was too handsome."
"115740052-0-36313";"One of those types, huh? Was he wearing a poofy shirt too?"
"115740052-0-36314";"I don't get it. What's looks got to do with sailing?"
"115740052-0-36315";"You should not be out of bed, mama. Vijari will stay inside."
"115740052-0-36316";"Shh, Vijari, it's all right. Just sit with this one a while."
"115740052-0-36317";"Vijari is ready."
"115740052-0-36318";"Now, just as I instructed."
"115740052-0-36319";"The blood of a flightless bird."
"115740052-0-36320";"Whose feathers still sail on the wind."
"115740052-0-36321";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"115740052-0-36322";"Honoria, who is this?"
"115740052-0-36323";"May they lighten your burdens on the journey ahead."
"115740052-0-36324";"This is your daughter, Jano. Catina. This is why I left. The ritual posed too high a risk for an unborn child. I tried to tell you. So many times. But you were so busy, and … I was a coward."
"115740052-0-36325";"The skin of her fallen children."
"115740052-0-36326";"Whose souls are gently carried in Khenarthi's arms."
"115740052-0-36327";"Catina …. I had no idea. She has your eyes, Honoria."
"115740052-0-36328";"And your stubbornness, my love. Which is why I knew she would find a way to help us. I should have told you. I'm so sorry."
"115740052-0-36329";"Thank you. Thank you for showing her to me. I … I only wish I had more time."
"115740052-0-36330";"You should have seen the battle, mother! Flames and ice, swords and arrows! It was spectacular."
"115740052-0-36331";"Mother must say, slaying Dragons is certainly a step up from stealing temple heirlooms."
"115740052-0-36332";"You'll never let that one go, will you?"
"115740052-0-36333";"Nahfahlaar!"
"115740052-0-36334";"Remove that wheel lock or we'll never sail out of here."
"115740052-0-36337";"The Path of the New Moon awaits, initiate! Let us see if you're worthy to join our cause."
"115740052-0-36338";"Let the light of truth shine through the darkness! Salvation lies with our Dragon lords!"
"115740052-0-36339";"You passed the first trial, initiate. But greater challenges lie ahead."
"115740052-0-36340";"The structure becomes less stable with every vibration. Let's try through this door."
"115740052-0-36341";"Do you need help?"
"115740052-0-36342";"Vijari will manage."
"115740052-0-36343";"Just as she feared. This place is being swallowed by the Great Darkness."
"115740052-0-36344";"Close your ears to evil's heart and focus on Adara'hai's voice."
"115740052-0-36345";"There! A Khenarthic bell! Strike it with all your might!"
"115740052-0-36346";"A moment's peace."
"115740052-0-36347";"There will be more bells along this path. Do not lose sight of them in the dark."
"115740052-0-36348";"Another bell, just ahead."
"115740052-0-36349";"The bell! Do you see it?"
"115740052-0-36350";"Do not listen! A Bent Cat's words are poison."
"115740052-0-36351";"The true Wall of Life. He did it."
"115740052-0-36352";"Ka'ishka? Are they here? Tell them to come closer."
"115740052-0-36353";"Ka'ishka?"
"115740052-0-36354";"She is here."
"115740052-0-36355";"You have carried Vijari this far. Please do not bear the weight after he is gone."
"115740052-0-36356";"She will not let you go a moment sooner."
"115740052-0-36357";"Are we outside? Mother? Vijari feels a breeze …."
"115740052-0-36358";"Nice! The southwest gate just opened."
"115740052-0-36359";"The gate in front of the doorway opened! We must be close now."
"115740052-0-36360";"It's done, walker. Dak'radhi's been cast back to the Dark Behind the World, but has his curse been lifted?"
"115740052-0-36362";"Hold them off while I prepare the ritual!"
"115740052-0-36363";"Eight bless you! You must hurry, friend. They dragged Father Egnatius to the Temple of the One. He is the wisest of us … the most pious and kind. Please, save him!"
"115740052-0-36364";"Come, my brothers and sisters! Lend me your aid!"
"115740052-0-36365";"<Scream>"
"115740052-0-36366";"Fine! I will destroy you myself."
"115740052-0-36367";"Soon …."
"115740052-0-36368";"This isn't a bloody roadside inn, Fabilius. We're refugees. You'll have to make do with what I can scavenge."
"115740052-0-36369";"Pish posh! The master deserves the finest, regardless of our current circumstances!"
"115740052-0-36370";"For the glory of the New Moon!"
"115740052-0-36371";"You pathetic curs! Get in there and kill the intruders!"
"115740052-0-36372";"Looks like this one will have to stop you himself!"
"115740052-0-36373";"<<Dying, gurgled scream.>>"
"115740052-0-36374";"Ah, the Dragonguard arrives."
"115740052-0-36375";"How can Lahini possibly move this thing?"
"115740052-0-36376";"Every time you kill one of those Dark Aeon creatures, your mask glows with power!"
"115740052-0-36377";"This one sent you to Rimmen and you wind up in Senchal expanding our business? Hizhikar is impressed!"
"115740052-0-36378";"Sailors and sweetmeats, beggars and thieves! Welcome to the Black Kiergo Arena!"
"115740052-0-36379";"Did you hear that, walker? We passed the trial!"
"115740052-0-36380";"Our path is long and our burden great, but benevolent Dragon lords watch over us."
"115740052-0-36381";"Good work! Lahini will follow your path."
"115740052-0-36382";"You have proven yourself worthy of the New Moon! Come, acolytes. Let us talk inside."
"115740052-0-36383";"Yes! We made it!"
"115740052-0-36384";"The time has come, initiates! As the New Moon rises, we shall rise with it!"
"115740052-0-36385";"Just get these ropes off. Can't feel my hands."
"115740052-0-36386";"What possible reason could you have? We could have saved these people, Honoria. Why? Why did you leave me?"
"115740052-0-36391";"Down here, walker! Jump!"
"115740052-0-36392";"Punzala will claw your heart out!"
"115740052-0-36393";"Ugh. Don't get your beard in a twist, Sormund."
"115740052-0-36394";"Dur Vul Daan!"
"115740052-0-36395";"This one hears a purr. You found Tender Claw, yes?"
"115740052-0-36396";"Oh, J'saad … where are you?"
"115740052-0-36397";"Hmm. If you'll excuse me, I need a few moments with my thoughts."
"115740052-0-36398";"No … this is not the end …!"
"115740052-0-36399";"Now, mask-bearer. We finish this!"
"115740052-0-36400";"Such a wonder …."
"115740052-0-36401";"This place, it goes on forever! So many islands, but no way to reach them."
"115740052-0-36402";"Before we enter, prepare yourselves. And this might be the last time we have a chance to talk, so use it well."
"115740052-0-36403";"Stay a moment, Sai Sahan. You can meet our friend at Moonlit Cove."
"115740052-0-36404";"Search the area! We need to find out what the cult wants with Pridehome."
"115740052-0-36405";"Walker! Over here! Malahbu is here!"
"115740052-0-36407";"Over here! Quick!"
"115740052-0-36408";"That's it! Now the other!"
"115740052-0-36409";"Vijari-ma! Dak'radhi feels you near! Come to him! Come be free of this world!"
"115740052-0-36410";"The bells. Those damnable bells! Shrill and hollow! Empty as Khenarthi's promises!"
"115740052-0-36411";"Does the Wind come for my soul now? Where were you for Tuhada? Where were you for me?"
"115740052-0-36412";"Wait! Stop this, father!"
"115740052-0-36413";"Dance with me, Vijari! Down in the Darkness where death cannot find you. We will never be separated again!"
"115740052-0-36414";"Vijari won't follow where you want him to go."
"115740052-0-36415";"Dak'radhi can't lose you too! He won't!"
"115740052-0-36416";"Vijari doesn't fear dying, father. He fears what you've become."
"115740052-0-36417";"We must make certain the Wall of Life was cleansed."
"115740052-0-36418";"Five-claw, come here please."
"115740052-0-36419";"It actually worked! Follow that trail. I'll take the other one."
"115740052-0-36420";"Sai Sahan will want to know about this! We'll report in while you go after Nahfahlaar."
"115740052-0-36421";"Find anything?"
"115740052-0-36422";"First ice storms, now fire. Keep your guard up. The coven won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets too close."
"115740052-0-36423";"I'll cast spheres of protection upon the grapple points when Kaalgrontiid prepares to shout!"
"115740052-0-36424";"It's all right. I'm ready to help."
"115740052-0-36426";"I can help with that. Bring the map from Tzinghalis's sanctum over here."
"115740052-0-36427";"Place it on the table. I want to show you something."
"115740052-0-36428";"See those marks? Gray Host sites that correspond to the communique we found."
"115740052-0-36429";"Ah, good. I was hoping you'd show up."
"115740052-0-36430";"Fools! Our business is no concern of yours!"
"115740052-0-36431";"That's all you've got? It will take more than that to fell Lyris Titanborn, you bastards!"
"115740052-0-36432";"The note said Ironbelly does business at the Withered Tree inn. This way."
"115740052-0-36433";"Once we spot Ironbelly, we'll follow from a distance until he leads us to the coven."
"115740052-0-36434";"This is the place. Let's head inside and finalize our plans."
"115740052-0-36435";"Ah, good lizard! I'll take a pint of your finest ale!"
"115740052-0-36436";"And what have we here? You're a strapping lass! Let Old Ironbelly buy you a drink or two? What do you say?"
"115740052-0-36437";"Not interested."
"115740052-0-36438";"Not interested? Goharth Ironbelly never takes no for an answer."
"115740052-0-36439";"Go away, little man, before I break you."
"115740052-0-36440";"I beg your pardon! But things will be different after that witch lives up to her promise."
"115740052-0-36441";"Jano. Thank the Eight, it worked."
"115740052-0-36442";"Honoria? Is it really you?"
"115740052-0-36443";"So this is the power of the Mask of Alkosh! Come, we'll stop the cult from calling in reinforcements for Laatvulon!"
"115740052-0-36444";"That's the last of them. Onward! We have a Dragon to slay."
"115740052-0-36445";"Is someone out there? I could use your assistance. I'm quite trapped in here."
"115740052-0-36446";"Wah! Who—where? Huh? Ugh, not again."
"115740052-0-36447";"My thanks. Hear me out if you want to escape this place."
"115740052-0-36448";"Must you walk where Juisa just swept? You're as bad as her sister."
"115740052-0-36449";"I remember these halls. Once proud … now, ruined. All because of me."
"115740052-0-36450";"Please, help me make things right. Seek out the library. A letter from my beloved rests upon a writing desk. My atonement begins there."
"115740052-0-36451";"Jano was so desperate to save these people and I let him down. I let them all down. That's why I must make this right."
"115740052-0-36452";"Still … Jano doesn't know why I left. Why I had to protect the very thing that was more important than even myself. If only I would have told him …."
"115740052-0-36453";"No, damn it! Sneaky bastard!"
"115740052-0-36454";"He rigged the gate to lock behind him! Don't wait for me. Find Ironbelly."
"115740052-0-36455";"Never fails. Follow a rat, you wind up in a sewer."
"115740052-0-36456";"Don't be afraid. This may be jarring, but it's a necessary part of the plan."
"115740052-0-36457";"You're free. Now, please. Hurry and retrieve my flask."
"115740052-0-36458";"Did you find it? Give it to me."
"115740052-0-36459";"Were you followed, Ironbelly?"
"115740052-0-36460";"Of course not, Sister Balra. My caution is legendary."
"115740052-0-36461";"I thought I saw someone Sister Balra, but I lost them."
"115740052-0-36462";"There was an incident, but I took care of it, Sister Balra."
"115740052-0-36463";"And have the arrangements I requested been made?"
"115740052-0-36464";"The fliers have been distributed. And your friend with the fangs?"
"115740052-0-36465";"Busy, I'm afraid."
"115740052-0-36466";"You promised a vampire would turn me! Make good on our deal or I'll report this to the jarl!"
"115740052-0-36467";"You'll do nothing of the sort."
"115740052-0-36468";"Greedy fool outlived his usefulness."
"115740052-0-36469";"Follow closely! You never know what's wandering around in these old barrows."
"115740052-0-36470";"Where are you going? Never mind. I'll wait here until you get back."
"115740052-0-36471";"I wonder why the witches are storing all these things."
"115740052-0-36472";"See if you can find a weapon. I'll grab something more suited to my skills."
"115740052-0-36473";"Finally! This place is a maze of—wait, what happened?"
"115740052-0-36474";"I hope Ironbelly told you something before you killed him."
"115740052-0-36476";"That looks dangerous enough. Now come on, this way!"
"115740052-0-36477";"Don't talk down to me. I mean—you know what I mean. Cutting loose once in your life would do you some good."
"115740052-0-36478";"Juisa is glad you think so. Thank you for volunteering to take over her chores while she takes the week off."
"115740052-0-36479";"Ugh … kill me."
"115740052-0-36480";"What are you two doing out? Urgala still has need of you."
"115740052-0-36483";"You got a jar of the refined brew? Let's talk over here."
"115740052-0-36485";"Leaving? All right … I'll find a place to hide until you return."
"115740052-0-36486";"Kaalgrontiid is close. His power glows like the sun."
"115740052-0-36487";"Mjolen, don't be so negative! The elixir will work. You'll see!"
"115740052-0-36488";"So, do we have a way to defend against the harrowstorms or what?"
"115740052-0-36489";"Hurry, to the pinnacle!"
"115740052-0-36492";"You'll need my help. I'll meet you at the Hall of the Dead."
"115740052-0-36494";"Hold! Castle Dour is—Princess Svana?"
"115740052-0-36495";"Swordthane, our business is urgent. My friend will explain."
"115740052-0-36497";"A single flask? Fenn will have to make do. Let's get it back to—"
"115740052-0-36498";"Swordthane! Why has work—?"
"115740052-0-36499";"I gave strict orders, yet my daughter freely enters the castle grounds. What do they want, swordthane?"
"115740052-0-36500";"Shields of Senchal at the ready! Fire!"
"115740052-0-36501";"We came to offer our assistance, father. Swordthane, how can we help?"
"115740052-0-36502";"Uthlet has everything well in hand, child. Despite your intentions, you would only hinder our efforts."
"115740052-0-36503";"Go. The swordthane doesn't need my daughter or her wastrel underfoot."
"115740052-0-36504";"Once it's ready, I'll test the elixir."
"115740052-0-36505";"As you say, Lyris. Ah, here they come now. You have the sacred oil? Add it to the cauldron."
"115740052-0-36508";"Yes, a perfect fusion! It's ready to be tested. Come, let's talk."
"115740052-0-36509";"You and Fenn stay put until we clear a path to the Undergrove."
"115740052-0-36510";"You honor me with your presence, my king."
"115740052-0-36511";"Gray Host! Stay quiet and listen!"
"115740052-0-36513";"This harrowstorm must be the biggest we have ever wrought, my sister-in-arms."
"115740052-0-36514";"No need, we're here."
"115740052-0-36515";"The princess insisted …."
"115740052-0-36517";"We followed at a safe distance and only advanced after you cleared the way."
"115740052-0-36518";"You must leave these ruins! Explain why you're following me."
"115740052-0-36519";"From this point on, we stay together. And that's an order."
"115740052-0-36520";"Um, yes. What she said. Now let's enter the Undergrove."
"115740052-0-36522";"Who dares intrude—you! The murderers who killed our beloved Tzinghalis!"
"115740052-0-36523";"And you're about to join him."
"115740052-0-36524";"Impudent mortal! You will pay for your crime!"
"115740052-0-36525";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-36526";"Now for the rest of these curs!"
"115740052-0-36527";"My king, allow me the honor of spilling their blood!"
"115740052-0-36528";"We need to leave—Svana, no!"
"115740052-0-36529";"See to Lyris, Fenn. And pray your elixir works!"
"115740052-0-36530";"Protect Svana! She needs time for the elixir to do its job!"
"115740052-0-36531";"The elixir … it worked!"
"115740052-0-36532";"Mother, you can't be here. It will kill you."
"115740052-0-36533";"Freiwen, I thought you died! I can't leave you. Even if it kills me."
"115740052-0-36534";"It's already killing you! Please, get away from me!"
"115740052-0-36535";"Mother! No!"
"115740052-0-36536";"Listen to your daughter, Svargrim. We need to do something."
"115740052-0-36537";"Don't test me, Reddharn. I know exactly what I need to do."
"115740052-0-36538";"I didn't think you had it in you, daughter. You have actually surpassed my expectations. More's the pity."
"115740052-0-36539";"And I'll hear no more talk of this miracle elixir."
"115740052-0-36540";"Father, no!"
"115740052-0-36541";"The Gray Host is my true ally! Once the harrowstorm engulfs Solitude, my kingdom will endure for all eternity!"
"115740052-0-36542";"Svana …."
"115740052-0-36543";"I should have sensed it … Svargrim's a vampire!"
"115740052-0-36546";"Corpses? What do they have to do with the medallions? Let's examine the nearby graveyard."
"115740052-0-36547";"I've never known a Nord to abandon a meal while there's still food on the plate."
"115740052-0-36548";"Bedrolls. For those who came for the ""lucrative opportunity."" I wonder where they are now?"
"115740052-0-36549";"Fresh blood. It leads to that hatch. Great. The trail leads into the basement."
"115740052-0-36550";"Empty? That's not right. There must be a secret passage. See if you can find it."
"115740052-0-36551";"I knew there had to be a secret passage! Let's see where this goes."
"115740052-0-36552";"We're not going to hurt you. Talk to him. I'll take a look up ahead."
"115740052-0-36553";"Did you send these people, Freiwen?"
"115740052-0-36555";"Freiwen, forgive me!"
"115740052-0-36556";"See that mound? That's the barrow. The entrance will be down below."
"115740052-0-36558";"Of course! Blackreach! The Gray Host must have gained access to the temple from beneath the city!"
"115740052-0-36559";"They could easily hide the witch pikes underneath our feet."
"115740052-0-36560";"We know the Gray Host has been using Blackreach to clandestinely move around Western Skyrim. Why not launch their attacks from there?"
"115740052-0-36561";"Then we're going back to Blackreach. If the witch pikes are there, we'll destroy them."
"115740052-0-36564";"A Windhelm sentry? Down here? Hey! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-36565";"Idiot! Sells out the Skald-King for a handful of gold."
"115740052-0-36566";"The jarl's soldiers, they've become harrowfiends."
"115740052-0-36567";"That's … ominous. And, unless I miss my guess, it's directly under Solitude."
"115740052-0-36568";"Doesn't look like anyone is on alert. Maybe we got here in time."
"115740052-0-36569";"Housecarl! The Skald-King, where is he?"
"115740052-0-36570";"I can't divulge such information. Even the great Lyris Titanborn must know that. It's a matter of royal security!"
"115740052-0-36571";"Royal security? Listen, you little fool … argh! You talk to her!"
"115740052-0-36572";"Into the palace. Let's move!"
"115740052-0-36573";"Monsters, in this holy place? We need to find the temple priests!"
"115740052-0-36574";"That's done. Let's tell the jarl what happened here."
"115740052-0-36575";"Leave the Skald-King alone, witch!"
"115740052-0-36576";"Jorunn is ours! He will make a fine addition to our patron's forces!"
"115740052-0-36577";"Damn shapeshifters!"
"115740052-0-36578";"Maps of Haafingar? Why would the coven and its allies need that?"
"115740052-0-36579";"That map details the distribution of troops throughout Skyrim. Look, they tore off the western holds."
"115740052-0-36580";"The key to the dungeons? Jorunn wasn't up here, so let's search down there."
"115740052-0-36581";"They wanted to turn me into a monster!"
"115740052-0-36582";"I've had enough of this dungeon. Let's talk in the throne room."
"115740052-0-36583";"Priest Ahmin? Wait!"
"115740052-0-36584";"Follow me. He fled into the vestry!"
"115740052-0-36585";"How far down does this tunnel lead?"
"115740052-0-36586";"Stay inside. Stick together. We'll … we'll take care of this."
"115740052-0-36587";"Let's hurry. Every second we waste could be the difference between life or death."
"115740052-0-36588";"Ahmin, please! You don't want to do this!"
"115740052-0-36589";"We need to destroy that gray reliquary!"
"115740052-0-36590";"Split up? I suppose that makes sense. I'll go with our friend here."
"115740052-0-36591";"Split up and find the ritual site. We need to disrupt it."
"115740052-0-36592";"Hello, this looks important!"
"115740052-0-36593";"This time we'll harvest all of the gray reliquaries!"
"115740052-0-36594";"Stay back! Don't make me—oh, you're not one of the witches or their monsters."
"115740052-0-36595";"There they are!"
"115740052-0-36596";"Lyris, Svana! I think this entire tower functions as a witch pike!"
"115740052-0-36597";"What? Fenn, how is that even possible?"
"115740052-0-36598";"Pain is part of the process, Svargrim."
"115740052-0-36599";"It's … exquisite … my master!"
"115740052-0-36600";"The cellar. Jarl Olfwenn is in the cellar. Make sure that she's all right."
"115740052-0-36602";"Once you are attuned to Greymoor, the storm will be yours to command."
"115740052-0-36603";"They're moving higher up the tower! We need to follow them!"
"115740052-0-36604";"They're worse than drunkards after the mead hall closes!"
"115740052-0-36609";"Priest Bavian! Our own brethren have turned against us! They've become monsters!"
"115740052-0-36610";"A barrier …."
"115740052-0-36612";"And—Rada al-Saran?"
"115740052-0-36613";"Come on, you brainless cur! This way!"
"115740052-0-36615";"And so the thorns arrive once more to prick my thumbs …."
"115740052-0-36616";"Bold words, but futile. Svargrim rises, and the harrowstorm with him. Once the attunement is finished, they will be unstoppable!"
"115740052-0-36617";"What happened? What did that damned vampire do?"
"115740052-0-36619";"He's merging the power flowing through the keep with Svargrim, giving him control of the harrowstorm."
"115740052-0-36620";"Then you must undo it. I'll stay and help. Lyris, you and our friend keep going up and find my father."
"115740052-0-36621";"We weren't able to stop the attunement spell. It's just getting stronger!"
"115740052-0-36622";"That tower! It must lead to the upper levels. I need time to get that door open."
"115740052-0-36623";"The smell of blood is … overwhelming. We should move on."
"115740052-0-36624";"You killed my brother. For that, you die!"
"115740052-0-36625";"The attunement is complete, Svargrim. You and Greymoor Keep are one."
"115740052-0-36628";"The power! I am unstoppable!"
"115740052-0-36629";"I leave the harrowing of Solitude to you, little king. Remember your oath to me."
"115740052-0-36630";"We need to hurry!"
"115740052-0-36632";"I—yes … it's the only option. Let's go."
"115740052-0-36633";"Look, above the Tower of the Wolf. The storm's only partially formed."
"115740052-0-36634";"The harrowstorm, it's begun!"
"115740052-0-36636";"My father's up there. Open the gates and let's go."
"115740052-0-36637";"But the harrowfiends below the temple! If they escape into the streets—"
"115740052-0-36638";"You and I will keep that from happening. Take the Princess and deal with Svargrim, partner."
"115740052-0-36640";"Over here! We're almost to the exit."
"115740052-0-36641";"Quick, hide! Look up on the bridge."
"115740052-0-36642";"Ah, daughter. Come to bear witness to my ascension?"
"115740052-0-36643";"Rada al-Saran has given me power beyond anything you can imagine. Behold!"
"115740052-0-36644";"As you'll see, the storm's effects will be quite devastating."
"115740052-0-36645";"As long as everything's ready for the first harvest, Urgala, I will be pleased."
"115740052-0-36646";"That—that was for mother. For Solitude. And for every soul in Skyrim."
"115740052-0-36647";"Very curious. Let's talk for a moment."
"115740052-0-36648";"Your ambition, your greed. Look what it led to."
"115740052-0-36649";"My father betrayed everything to aid the Gray Host. With his death, Solitude is saved."
"115740052-0-36651";"The harrowstorm ritual is a thing of beauty, Urgala. I'll be in touch after the harvest."
"115740052-0-36652";"You escaped? No matter, for soon all of Skyrim will fall!"
"115740052-0-36653";"Your efforts mean nothing! The harvest will succeed!"
"115740052-0-36655";"The storm! Somehow that pike is involved! Destroy it, quickly!"
"115740052-0-36656";"You did it! The storm's dissipated."
"115740052-0-36657";"There must be legions of these stone husks! Gods, it unsettles me just to look at them."
"115740052-0-36658";"That energy, they're waking up! Get ready to fight!"
"115740052-0-36659";"Keep moving! Don't let them surround us!"
"115740052-0-36660";"Come on! We're nearly through!"
"115740052-0-36661";"A dead end? Damn!"
"115740052-0-36664";"Lyris Titanborn. Your reputation is known even here in the west. Is this one of your famed Companions?"
"115740052-0-36665";"No, but I assure you my partner is one of the Skald-King's best. Go introduce yourself, partner."
"115740052-0-36667";"More weapons. Grab anything you think might be useful."
"115740052-0-36668";"The door ahead! You go first."
"115740052-0-36670";"Fenn? You in here? Hmm. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-36671";"Fenn never struck me as a messy person. Could there have been a struggle here?"
"115740052-0-36673";"My friend asked nicely. Talk, or the next thing to roll will be your heads."
"115740052-0-36674";"Kasalla! Kasalla! She handles all the smuggling in Solitude! Her warehouse is on the docks!"
"115740052-0-36675";"Leaving? Fine. Let me know when you're ready to get back to it."
"115740052-0-36677";"That wasn't so hard. Come on, partner. We're done here."
"115740052-0-36678";"Burnt papers? Someone was trying to hide something."
"115740052-0-36684";"That's what we were looking for. Let's talk over there."
"115740052-0-36685";"What if he's already dead?"
"115740052-0-36686";"They, um …."
"115740052-0-36687";"Hey, partner, glad I found you. Now let's get Fenn and return to the Blue Palace."
"115740052-0-36690";"Oh, thank all the gods. You're not one of the Reachmen."
"115740052-0-36691";"They went through this door. Come on!"
"115740052-0-36692";"Hircine's claws, I thought I'd be digging forever! Thanks!"
"115740052-0-36693";"Hafskjar? Just in time!"
"115740052-0-36695";"Why has Meridia forsaken me?"
"115740052-0-36696";"Head to the surface. I need to fulfill my end of our bargain."
"115740052-0-36697";"What's this? Come to steal away our queen again? I'll see that you fail!"
"115740052-0-36703";"Let's hope Fenn is unharmed."
"115740052-0-36706";"Hafskjar! Praise Kyne, we're saved."
"115740052-0-36707";"You're safe now. Wait, where's Bjora? Why isn't she with you?"
"115740052-0-36708";"They took her across the bridge. I heard them mention meeting witches."
"115740052-0-36709";"You dare touch me, vampire? I may fall today, but by Onsi's bright blade, I will take you with me!"
"115740052-0-36710";"Bjora? What's wrong with her?"
"115740052-0-36711";"Please, just listen. I am not allied with those graverobbers. If you keep this up, those wounds will reopen."
"115740052-0-36713";"That's the last of them! Let's pray that their hold over Bjora has broken."
"115740052-0-36714";"Bjora! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-36715";"Hafskjar? I'm … oh, what have I done?"
"115740052-0-36717";"Meet us at Fenrar's camp. It's the safest place for now."
"115740052-0-36719";"That smell, it's overpowering! We need to shut down those machines."
"115740052-0-36721";"It's too late … for me …."
"115740052-0-36722";"You set me free? I owe you one!"
"115740052-0-36723";"Kyne's breath it's good to see you all. We've made it."
"115740052-0-36724";"We'll find somewhere new. If we stick together, we'll survive this."
"115740052-0-36725";"Here's the one who saved me."
"115740052-0-36726";"We are in your debt, wanderer."
"115740052-0-36727";"You are welcome here, Fennorian of House Ravenwatch."
"115740052-0-36728";"There you are. Let's investigate the coastal camp."
"115740052-0-36729";"Finished? Have you come to any conclusions?"
"115740052-0-36730";"Well done, wayfarer. Look there on the door—the Pyre Watch sigil. These Draugrkin must have used Tu'whacca's Gaze to unlock it."
"115740052-0-36731";"How far down does this ruin go, Shelaria? Surely they found enough bones up here to fill those urns they brought."
"115740052-0-36732";"I do not know. No Pyre Watch sentinel has ventured this far into the tomb since our ancestors sealed it. Come. Our answers lie ahead."
"115740052-0-36733";"You've done it, Claudina! Truly excellent work!"
"115740052-0-36734";"Phebe … we have a visitor."
"115740052-0-36736";"That's Kasalla's warehouse. Only one sentry. Let's try not to cause a scene."
"115740052-0-36738";"I don't know what you said to him, but this is our chance. Try the lock."
"115740052-0-36739";"Another sealed door, but no statues or sigils. Any ideas, blood-drinker?"
"115740052-0-36740";"A few. The corresponding sigils may be in another room. We should have a look around—perhaps in that vault to the north."
"115740052-0-36741";"Gah! The damned thing won't come to life. How else are we supposed to get it to strike those sigils?"
"115740052-0-36742";"We wouldn't be in this situation if you weren't lagging behind when the door resealed itself."
"115740052-0-36744";"Wake up, damn you! Wake up!"
"115740052-0-36745";"Grumog, please! There's no need for alarm."
"115740052-0-36746";"See what's in those marked crates. I'll watch the door."
"115740052-0-36747";"More than you. Care to try me?"
"115740052-0-36748";"I knew whoever was poking through our shipments would return. Brought muscle this time, I see."
"115740052-0-36749";"I'll pass. I just want to know who's been meddling in my business."
"115740052-0-36751";"Did you see that basket move?"
"115740052-0-36752";"Give your sentry my best and tell him I owe him an autograph."
"115740052-0-36753";"Oh, he's going to get more than an autograph if I see him again."
"115740052-0-36754";"Phebe, wait! What have I told you about jumping to conclusions!"
"115740052-0-36755";"Friends! The door unsealed! It's just—whoa, what happened in here?"
"115740052-0-36756";"Never mind. Shelaria managed to capture one of the Draugrkin. Come quickly!"
"115740052-0-36757";"Please … I'll submit. Tell Essenia I'll do anything she asks!"
"115740052-0-36758";"Prisoners. Come on, let's hurry!"
"115740052-0-36759";"Huh?"
"115740052-0-36760";"A straggler? I have more than I need, so I'll just feast on you here."
"115740052-0-36761";"Where is Tu'whacca's Gaze? Where is your leader?"
"115740052-0-36762";"Kjalnar Tombskald took your magic lantern with him … farther into the cave! You'll never catch him, Redguard. Not before he—"
"115740052-0-36766";"Before he what? What are you godless dogs doing here? Speak!"
"115740052-0-36767";"Ha! You have no idea what's coming. When the one who sent us comes to power, you'll beg for death. Beg!"
"115740052-0-36769";"Stop! A disaster has befallen Kilkreath Temple!"
"115740052-0-36770";"Shelaria … what did you do?"
"115740052-0-36771";"Enough of this!"
"115740052-0-36772";"You heard what he said. Their leader and Tu'whacca's Gaze are ahead. Shed a tear for this monster if you wish, but make it quick."
"115740052-0-36773";"Can you feel the lingering energy? That's Daedric, if I'm not mistaken."
"115740052-0-36774";"It's depleted. Just ordinary sticks and rope now. Interesting."
"115740052-0-36775";"An alchemical residue. That should prove useful."
"115740052-0-36777";"Strange. They're alive, but unresponsive. Check the crates and see if they contain the smuggled items."
"115740052-0-36778";"These are temple priests and pilgrims. It seems the storm killed them."
"115740052-0-36779";"Come, it can't have gone far."
"115740052-0-36781";"What was that? It came from inside!"
"115740052-0-36783";"Lucky Maugh passed along your message. I would have hated to miss all this mud."
"115740052-0-36788";"You're free! Get out of here, quickly! Except you, Nord. You're coming with us."
"115740052-0-36789";"What? No! We'll talk outside! I'm not going to—"
"115740052-0-36790";"You are going to, or I'm going to throw you back in that cage. Now, move!"
"115740052-0-36792";"You're as bad as Essenia …."
"115740052-0-36793";"I've explored more tombs than I care to recall, and I've never seen a guardian like this."
"115740052-0-36794";"Enough with your academics, vampire! We did not come here to study, we came here to stop the Draugrkin!"
"115740052-0-36795";"Bruik! Killing Captain Ageran was not part of our deal!"
"115740052-0-36796";"I am a vampire, Urlvar. I have needs. I made that clear when you hired me."
"115740052-0-36797";"I hired you to protect my people! This was not what we agreed … you've taken it too far!"
"115740052-0-36798";"Who are you to reprimand me? You haven't seen too far! Just wait!"
"115740052-0-36799";"Perhaps I could question the witch before you introduce her to your impressive axe blade?"
"115740052-0-36803";"It's all beginning to make sense."
"115740052-0-36804";"That's close enough, leech!"
"115740052-0-36806";"Not even harrowed? It seems the ritual needs refinement."
"115740052-0-36807";"Kill her before she can summon another storm!"
"115740052-0-36808";"Go with your vampire friend. I'm going to look around here."
"115740052-0-36809";"I hoped you could take her prisoner. No matter, I found something. This way!"
"115740052-0-36810";"I only mean to say that this level of protection … are you sure there's nothing else here, Shelaria? Nothing beyond the remains of the Gray Host?"
"115740052-0-36811";"What does it matter? Kjalnar and his graverobbing jackals still outpace us. We must move quicker!"
"115740052-0-36814";"Shh. She's resting."
"115740052-0-36817";"The vampire! Follow him, but stay out of sight!"
"115740052-0-36818";"I had no idea such grand ruins stood in the heart of this place."
"115740052-0-36819";"Yokudan, yes? The works of your ancestors from beyond the sea?"
"115740052-0-36820";"Damn, another dead soldier and no sign of our supplies."
"115740052-0-36821";"Yes. Thank Mara, they all rest in glory on the Far Shores. If they could see what their home has become … the shame would be unbearable."
"115740052-0-36822";"Persistent, aren't we? Hear me, Draugrkin! Do not let these troublemakers reach the center of the tomb!"
"115740052-0-36823";"You dare disturb me!"
"115740052-0-36824";"Whatever it is—whatever these beasts have conjured here—it will face a lasting death at our hands."
"115740052-0-36825";"We're almost there. I can sense it crawling up my spine. Something profoundly evil lurks here."
"115740052-0-36827";"The embers are still warm. Ah, over here, what did you find?"
"115740052-0-36828";"Kjalnar! I'll kill you for what you've done!"
"115740052-0-36830";"She's in no condition to fight. Go! Kill that fiend!"
"115740052-0-36831";"We need to see the high king."
"115740052-0-36832";"I should think not! The high king is in mourning. He's not to be disturbed."
"115740052-0-36833";"The queen's wasn't the only life lost today. Now get out of our way."
"115740052-0-36834";"I … er … go right in."
"115740052-0-36835";"Your highness, please. Your kingdom is in grave danger."
"115740052-0-36836";"My queen's blood hasn't yet cooled and already Jorunn's lackeys hound me!"
"115740052-0-36837";"We have proof that the coven threatening your kingdom is responsible for the queen's death. Show him, partner."
"115740052-0-36838";"We'll leave you to your grief, your highness."
"115740052-0-36839";"By all means, try. Our patron demanded the remains of the Gray Host. What's the harm in adding a few more corpses?"
"115740052-0-36841";"Is it true? Mother told me you were working for her before she …."
"115740052-0-36842";"I … I'm sorry, Svana. I would have saved her if I could."
"115740052-0-36843";"Don't call me princess. Just Svana. There's nothing noble about me."
"115740052-0-36844";"Come on, princess. Let's get you somewhere safe."
"115740052-0-36845";"Damn you, Fennorian. That … that was my fight"
"115740052-0-36846";"A fight you would have lost. I don't expect gratitude, but you're welcome all the same."

"115740052-0-36862";"I trust you will, Shelaria. As for me, I have some investigating to do—starting with this mysterious patron Kjalnar mentioned."
"115740052-0-36863";"Whoever they are, I suspect they've already gotten what they wanted. The Draugrkin smuggled a great many urns out of the Grave before you arrived. Tu'whacca help us all."
"115740052-0-36864";"Yes, captain."
"115740052-0-36865";"Station sentries on both sides of the bridge. As many as you can."

"115740052-0-36884";"My husband would never do something so insane! I don't suppose you have any proof?"
"115740052-0-36885";"Proof? What proof could they possibly have?"
"115740052-0-36888";"I think there's a cavern up ahead."
"115740052-0-36889";"Move! You take the east side, I'll take the west. Then meet in the middle."
"115740052-0-36890";"I did what was needed! You should be thanking me!"

"115740052-0-36922";"A giant frostbite spider! Kill it, my friend!"
"115740052-0-36923";"You know what the Gray Host does with spies? We eat them!"
"115740052-0-36924";"Look, the sky! What have they done? We must reach that clearing!"
"115740052-0-36925";"We have to find Captain Mavvok."
"115740052-0-36926";"The blizzard … it's getting worse!"
"115740052-0-36927";"We should be able to catch up with Matron Urgala through here."
"115740052-0-36928";"Witches and their servants are everywhere. We could sneak through if you wish to avoid more battles."
"115740052-0-36931";"We must be getting close."
"115740052-0-36937";"Stand down, you idiots! We come in peace!"
"115740052-0-36939";"Shor save me from fools and prophets! Will no one properly greet a weary traveler?"
"115740052-0-36940";"Molozu gave me no choice, Bavian. I swear it."
"115740052-0-36941";"Ah! Wonderful!"
"115740052-0-36942";"We have no need of help that involves welcoming your soldiers within our walls."
"115740052-0-36943";"My walls, jarl."
"115740052-0-36944";"My father may have been willing to slap aside a helping hand, but I'm not. Permit me a word with your envoy, Skald-King."
"115740052-0-36947";"Don't you love me, Hagridden? Do you want to see me grow old, wither, and die? It's a small sacrifice for eternity."
"115740052-0-36949";"Listen to yourself, Essenia. Even one life is too many! I can't make that kind of sacrifice. Not even for you."
"115740052-0-36950";"I was hoping you'd return before we began. Tell me you've got good news."
"115740052-0-36951";"Sons and daughters of Skyrim. We have the honor today of remembering the dead."
"115740052-0-36952";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-36953";"Sons and daughters of Skyrim, our trials were fierce, but we are still here."
"115740052-0-36954";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-36955";"Now we raise our voices—to tell Sovngarde of the coming of the worthy dead, and to tell the world that the Nords are still here! We are still standing!"
"115740052-0-36956";"Sovngarde, welcome them home!"
"115740052-0-36957";"Let us remember them with song and drink!"
"115740052-0-36958";"Sound the horns! Ring the bells! Recite the ancient hymns!"
"115740052-0-36959";"We, the children of Skyrim! We shall endure!"
"115740052-0-36962";"That's the brute who threw us in our cell! We have to get past him."
"115740052-0-36966";"Look! A priest of Meridia! Maybe they can tell us more about what happened at the temple."
"115740052-0-36968";"Damn these harrowstorms and what they do to my people!"
"115740052-0-36969";"There you are. Let's find out what the Gray Host has planned."
"115740052-0-36970";"The living take precedence. We should search for survivors while investigating the pikes."
"115740052-0-36971";"Hmm. No visible damage despite its proximity to the eye of the storm."
"115740052-0-36972";"What happened to this poor woman? She looks distraught."
"115740052-0-36973";"Keep calm. We mean you no harm."
"115740052-0-36975";"That's it. You've made it this far. What's a little further?"
"115740052-0-36978";"Maugh, put away the tankard and get the supplies Fenn requires."
"115740052-0-36979";"Yes, your royal ladyness. But I'm keeping the tankard."
"115740052-0-36981";"Princess Svana? What can I do for you, your highness?"
"115740052-0-36982";"Listen to my friend, high priest. We need your help."
"115740052-0-36983";"Come on … just a little farther …."
"115740052-0-36984";"Go on. Just remember, I'll be keeping an eye on you."
"115740052-0-36985";"You, there! What did that fugitive tell you?"
"115740052-0-36987";"Greetings to all! Hurry now! Our entertainment begins momentarily!"
"115740052-0-36988";"Stay back! I'll do it! I'll stab you!"
"115740052-0-36989";"You must be Maugh. I have questions."
"115740052-0-36990";"Questions? Happy to oblige. Buy a few rounds and let's chat!"
"115740052-0-36991";"Hey! Nobody intimidates my friends!"
"115740052-0-36992";"Princess Svana?"
"115740052-0-36993";"What was all that screaming?"
"115740052-0-36995";"This mist, like what we saw at Kilkreath Temple. There was a harrowstorm down here."
"115740052-0-36996";"For your treason against your hold and your people, we cast you from the halls of your ancestors. May they never know your name."
"115740052-0-36997";"I did not betray my hold! She's the one who should face your judgment!"
"115740052-0-36998";"The Svana I know would leave all this bother behind. Come back to the Troll and let the royalty deal with this."
"115740052-0-36999";"I am the royalty, Maugh. It's time I started acting like it."
"115740052-0-37000";"Damn it, Urzikh … chief! We can't risk letting those monsters out. Think about the rest of the clan!"
"115740052-0-37001";"We're Orcs, Thulsgreg. I'm not about to tuck tail while our kin fight for their lives."
"115740052-0-37002";"You thought no one would find out? That none of us would survive? One is enough to expose your treason!"
"115740052-0-37004";"I—I gave no such order!"
"115740052-0-37006";"You lost? No, I wager you're just where you want to be. Ha! Well, come on then!"
"115740052-0-37007";"Everyone ready?"
"115740052-0-37008";"Aye. Tuned up."
"115740052-0-37011";"Shh! Don't mock the cursed! You'll call a hex down upon us!"
"115740052-0-37012";"Enough of this! Now you will die!"
"115740052-0-37013";"Use the whistle!"
"115740052-0-37014";"This is it. Look lively and let's get on with it."
"115740052-0-37017";"Fine. Just don't take all day."
"115740052-0-37018";"That's the wrong way. If you have something else more important to do, fine. I'll just wait here."
"115740052-0-37019";"This must be the place. I'll go back and get—"
"115740052-0-37020";"Collecting corpses? Gods. But that amulet … I wonder if it's around here somewhere."
"115740052-0-37021";"Sod off. This is my patch of ground."
"115740052-0-37022";"That's the leader of the Gray Host!"
"115740052-0-37023";"Rada al-Saran and Exarch Ulfra? Should we postpone the test?"
"115740052-0-37024";"Certainly not! The holds are counting on us! Besides, we might be able to end this threat right here and now."
"115740052-0-37025";"We need to find where they're experimenting with the harrowstorms."
"115740052-0-37026";"You'll die like all the rest!"
"115740052-0-37027";"Weaklings! The girl is ours now. She'll be our queen!"
"115740052-0-37028";"No! But the prophecy! Lord al-Saran gave his word!"
"115740052-0-37030";"You'll not interrupt our work! The girl is prophesied to lead the Reach!"
"115740052-0-37031";"Even if you kill me, the girl belongs to the Gray Host. There is no stopping it."
"115740052-0-37032";"The girl will be ours. One way or another."
"115740052-0-37033";"Death is not my end. Rada al-Saran will see that I rise once more!"
"115740052-0-37036";"Finally! Thank you, stranger."
"115740052-0-37037";"Very well, sweet sister. Join me in Greymoor Keep when the task is done."
"115740052-0-37038";"Let this harrowstorm flay the flesh from your bones!"
"115740052-0-37039";"So that was his crime? Sending his soldiers into a trap."
"115740052-0-37040";"The time has come. Rise, Tzirzhalir. I call you by name! Rise!"
"115740052-0-37041";"Sacrifice? Just what was that woman asking for?"
"115740052-0-37042";"Oh gods, I can feel his terror. It's suffocating."
"115740052-0-37043";"Who was she to be bossing a thane around?"
"115740052-0-37044";"I hope you rescue Fenn. The silk-shirt, he's a good man. For a vampire."
"115740052-0-37046";"Well, look at that! I suppose we've found our Dwarven ruins!"
"115740052-0-37048";"Ah, sorry, got ahead of myself. Not to worry! Pickle will help you find another way around."
"115740052-0-37049";"Jarl Hagridden has a matter of urgency for you to attend to."
"115740052-0-37050";"What does he know to send us this far into the Reach?"
"115740052-0-37052";"Don't be a fool, father! This elixir will save our people!"
"115740052-0-37053";"Be strong, Svana."
"115740052-0-37054";"Mother! No, no …."
"115740052-0-37055";"Svana … your father … the kingdom … watch over them …."
"115740052-0-37056";"Mother—no! You can't die! Mother?"
"115740052-0-37057";"We came here to warn you, your highness."
"115740052-0-37058";"Sire, the assassins might return. You must get somewhere safe!"
"115740052-0-37059";"Have Jorunn's lackeys come to gloat?"
"115740052-0-37060";"And yet my wife lies dead!"
"115740052-0-37061";"If you had listened to us …."
"115740052-0-37062";"Like she did? If I determine Jorunn had a hand in this, there will be war! Someone take care of my wife!"

"115740052-0-37065";"Do you have the key? We're wasting valuable time."
"115740052-0-37067";"Those things are even worse than I imagined they'd be."
"115740052-0-37068";"You make a grave mistake, trespassers. This chamber will be the death of you."
"115740052-0-37072";"You there! Are there other survivors? Where's foreman Mugha?"
"115740052-0-37073";"I haven't seen Mugha since the cave-in, chief. The rest are in hiding! The mines are completely overrun."
"115740052-0-37076";"More oafish trespassers. Can you not see that I'm on the brink of discovery?"
"115740052-0-37077";"My research nears its end, as do you, it seems."
"115740052-0-37078";"Open your eyes, Urzikh. It's too unstable. We can't risk a larger collapse!"
"115740052-0-37079";"We'll never get to them in time at this rate! We need to dissolve the stone!"
"115740052-0-37081";"You made it! But wait … where is my husband?"
"115740052-0-37082";"Harrowfiends! Not the result of the ritual we stopped, so they must have brought them from someplace else."
"115740052-0-37083";"Don't plan the funeral just yet, love!"
"115740052-0-37084";"Viggol? Is it really you?"
"115740052-0-37085";"That amulet! It almost seems like it's calming the blizzard!"
"115740052-0-37086";"Captain Mavvok and the crew have to be here somewhere!"
"115740052-0-37087";"You are not Zan'ikh … should I assume that you are here to kill me?"
"115740052-0-37091";"Behold the frost focus, the font of my creations!"
"115740052-0-37092";"Hey! Over here! Before those things come back!"
"115740052-0-37097";"That ice doesn't look natural. Maybe the amulet could melt it?"
"115740052-0-37098";"That's an ugly plant. Must be the netherroot mentioned in the note."

"115740052-0-37110";"You're going to answer me, Orc, or …."
"115740052-0-37111";"Not so tough now, huh? What do you want with Maugh?"
"115740052-0-37112";"They're headed to the courtyard! Bring them down!"
"115740052-0-37113";"There you are! I've searched everywhere—haven't found anyone. Anything up there?"
"115740052-0-37117";"Why does the princess of Solitude grace my humble hall with her royal presence? Are you here on behalf of the high king?"
"115740052-0-37118";"Oh, thank you. Thank you! You don't know how much this means to me."

"115740052-0-37135";"We're done. The Gray Host has found a foothold. Now the city is lost."
"115740052-0-37140";"Not yet it isn't. On your feet, swordthane. We have work to do!"
"115740052-0-37141";"I … yes, Princess Svana."
"115740052-0-37142";"New test subjects? Just in time. This one is about spent."
"115740052-0-37143";"Acolyte Eivina, please! Wake up!"
"115740052-0-37144";"We need to find High Priest Varkour. Let's head to the temple."
"115740052-0-37145";"That's unacceptable, swordthane. If we can't get the sacred oil to make more elixir, then we have to stop the harrowstorm."
"115740052-0-37146";"Princess, we've kept watch. There aren't any witch pikes around the city."
"115740052-0-37147";"Then you missed something. They needed the witch pikes for every other harrowstorm they summoned."
"115740052-0-37149";"Poor Larilvor. Take his Meridian medallion so we can remember his sacrifice."
"115740052-0-37150";"Who else? Ah, what a finale that was!"
"115740052-0-37151";"Calm yourself, acolyte, and tell me where the high priest is."
"115740052-0-37152";"Wait! Wait! I'm not part of the coven!"
"115740052-0-37153";"Down here! Did you find the key that opens the catacombs?"
"115740052-0-37154";"Oh no … even the catacombs are corrupted."
"115740052-0-37155";"The high priest, by the light! Quickly, retrieve the relic!"
"115740052-0-37157";"I'll put you two milk drinkers back in your cage!"
"115740052-0-37158";"The only way out is through him! I'll support you from back here."
"115740052-0-37159";"Strike him with a light attack!"
"115740052-0-37160";"Hit him again!"
"115740052-0-37163";"You're fast, but you can't withstand this!"
"115740052-0-37164";"Don't let his heavy attack hit you! Block it!"
"115740052-0-37165";"Strike him while he's off-balance!"
"115740052-0-37166";"You can't block what you can't see!"

"115740052-0-37168";"Think you're clever? Avoid this!"
"115740052-0-37169";"Another heavy attack! Interrupt him, quick!"

"115740052-0-37171";"Time to end this!"
"115740052-0-37172";"Finish him off so we can escape!"
"115740052-0-37173";"Help! You must set us free!"
"115740052-0-37174";"All of you, follow me! We'll sneak out once the coast is clear!"
"115740052-0-37175";"Definitely Dwarven. Watch out for traps."
"115740052-0-37176";"This chamber's been used recently. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-37184";"They killed Skelga! Right in front of me!"
"115740052-0-37185";"Settle, Hiti. You'll disturb the ritual! It must be perfect. Isn't that right, mother?"
"115740052-0-37186";"It is, dear one. Our patron's terms were fair, Hiti. If we wish to reap the reward, we must deliver what he desires."
"115740052-0-37188";"Argh! The energy … it burns!"
"115740052-0-37189";"That's my father. This way!"

"115740052-0-37200";"<Tortured sobbing.>"
"115740052-0-37201";"Go … warn Solitude …."
"115740052-0-37202";"Ugh … filthy. Wait, here we are. A medallion of some kind? Might prove useful eventually. You go on ahead. I'll catch up."
"115740052-0-37206";"Exarch Tzinghalis was insane, but he was also a genius. If he kept records, they'll be in here."
"115740052-0-37207";"I see a map and some papers. Hey, partner, take a look."
"115740052-0-37208";"There you are! The coast is clear outside."
"115740052-0-37209";"Everyone, protect Fenn!"
"115740052-0-37210";"Ah! Stay back!"
"115740052-0-37211";"They should be just up ahead. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-37212";"That door up ahead. Looks like the way up to the clearing."
"115740052-0-37213";"Raynor, stay close."
"115740052-0-37214";"Oh my, what is that incredible machine?"
"115740052-0-37215";"Got it!"
"115740052-0-37216";"Good job! Through the door and to the upper levels now, hurry!"
"115740052-0-37217";"Now we just—"
"115740052-0-37219";"Damn magic! Give me something to hit!"
"115740052-0-37221";"The magic, it's al-Saran! The attunement is almost complete!"
"115740052-0-37222";"Come on, Fenn. Princess Svana herself requested your presence at the Blue Palace."
"115740052-0-37223";"I don't believe I'm very good company right now."
"115740052-0-37224";"Come on, Fenn. We'll help you through this."
"115740052-0-37225";"We need to find my father. Lyris, take Fenn that way. We'll go the other."

"115740052-0-37239";"What is it, Pickle? You smell something, boy?"
"115740052-0-37240";"That's it! Now, throw the lever on the overlook to reset the device! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-37241";"Terribly sorry! I must go! Hah, home at last!"
"115740052-0-37242";"That's everything! Meet me outside. And bring those ingredients so I can prepare the elixir."
"115740052-0-37243";"Are we back? What in Ayem's name happened?"
"115740052-0-37244";"I think I'm going to be ill."
"115740052-0-37245";"A chillwind mushroom! And a fine specimen at that! Good work!"
"115740052-0-37246";"Deep lichen. The giant insects love the stuff!"
"115740052-0-37247";"I probably should have mentioned this earlier, but the only thing that makes me more nervous than giant bugs is dark, enclosed spaces!"
"115740052-0-37248";"You abandon me, in our moment of triumph? What game do you play, Rada al-Saran?"
"115740052-0-37249";"Game? I gave you power. If you can't conquer Skyrim, the fault is your own."
"115740052-0-37250";"Now ascend to your Tower of the Wolf and unleash my most potent harrowstorm! The Gray Host is counting on you, little king."
"115740052-0-37252";"This place is connected to Castle Dour! How long has my father been planning this?"
"115740052-0-37253";"You would have me spread my forces across the realm to search for nightmares you dredged up from a bottle?"
"115740052-0-37255";"It's not—"
"115740052-0-37256";"Or should I say the whispers of eastern vipers tickling your ears?"
"115740052-0-37257";"But mother—"
"115740052-0-37258";"Hold, friends!"
"115740052-0-37259";"We followed the booming voices. Where's Svargrim?"
"115740052-0-37260";"My father's ascended into Solitude. But Rada al-Saran, I think he's leaving."
"115740052-0-37261";"Interesting. Lyris assumed the Gray Host was preparing to attack, but it's just as possible they're relocating their forces."
"115740052-0-37262";"We'll figure that out later, after we stop my father!"
"115740052-0-37263";"Fair enough. Friend, lead the way."
"115740052-0-37265";"Harrowfiends. Corralled like war hounds about to be set loose."
"115740052-0-37266";"Up ahead, that's the temple's undercroft!"
"115740052-0-37267";"Harrowfiends! Is that what became of the harrowed Svargrim brought to Castle Dour?"
"115740052-0-37268";"Daedric? Do not think to blame Meridia for this, vampire."
"115740052-0-37269";"How could such a simple thing cause so much destruction?"
"115740052-0-37270";"And the substance stinks something awful!"
"115740052-0-37272";"You seem to know a lot about a great many things, vampire."
"115740052-0-37273";"These were good people. Devout followers. How could Meridia let this happen?"
"115740052-0-37274";"No … how is this possible?"
"115740052-0-37275";"Help! Assassins in the palace! Help!"
"115740052-0-37276";"That's one of the queen's attendants! Let's get inside!"
"115740052-0-37277";"Father, please!"
"115740052-0-37283";"The Ashen Lord, he turned Svargrim into the heart of his harrowstorm!"
"115740052-0-37284";"These tunnels look freshly dug. The Gray Host has certainly been busy."
"115740052-0-37288";"If I never have to enter another barrow, it will be too soon."
"115740052-0-37289";"For now, vampire. Only for now."
"115740052-0-37290";"Our new friend doesn't object to my presence. I hope that settles things?"
"115740052-0-37292";"Um. Hello, stranger. Are you lost?"
"115740052-0-37295";"My knife! I stuck it in the neck of a few cultists before they overwhelmed me."
"115740052-0-37296";"It's really a shame that all this beautiful scenery is wasted on these fools."
"115740052-0-37297";"My mirror! And the bungling ogres haven't broken it!"
"115740052-0-37298";"Ugh. It smells like death in here. Or … is that your pack?"
"115740052-0-37299";"Ah, my goblet!"
"115740052-0-37300";"Grandfather, no!"
"115740052-0-37301";"You escaped the barrow? No matter."
"115740052-0-37302";"More traps? Did those two idiots set these things throughout all of Blackreach?"
"115740052-0-37304";"Someone else has been here."
"115740052-0-37305";"Another extinguished flame."
"115740052-0-37306";"Whoever killed my grandfather must also be responsible for extinguishing these flames."
"115740052-0-37307";"There is one more flame to light. It must be within the ruin interior somewhere."
"115740052-0-37308";"Watch your back."
"115740052-0-37309";"Bah, they come. Protect the gray reliquary with your lives!"
"115740052-0-37310";"This flame … it's wrong! We may be too late!"
"115740052-0-37311";"Not now, Lyris. I … I need to think about this."
"115740052-0-37312";"What an exciting case! I simply must write down this new development."
"115740052-0-37313";"Focus on the task at hand, Phebe. There will be time for that later."
"115740052-0-37314";"I grow tired of killing those who stand in my way! You will not stop me from taking the Dragon Priest's power!"
"115740052-0-37316";"That's for Hjarnam and my grandfather, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-37318";"Ah, a fine hero appears in my hour of need! You there, I require your assistance!"
"115740052-0-37319";"I have been assured the city is ripe for harvest."
"115740052-0-37320";"Have we heard from Solitude? Is everything in place?"
"115740052-0-37321";"We did it! Morokei is entombed once more! Now, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-37322";"Ageran, no! Gods, no …."
"115740052-0-37323";"Breaking these things won't bring my people back, but the same goes for the Gray Host."
"115740052-0-37324";"That's done. Now let's check on the jarl. Her hall is right up the hill."
"115740052-0-37325";"Be one with the shadows! We cannot afford to be seen."
"115740052-0-37326";"A strange mist?"
"115740052-0-37327";"Follow it!"
"115740052-0-37332";"We're hungry but peaceful, my friend. Be welcome."
"115740052-0-37333";"Don't move until we return!"
"115740052-0-37334";"Don't hurt him or I'll — ugh! Hey, you! Untie me!"
"115740052-0-37335";"I shall have to scour the memory of cultist lips from it if I'm ever to drink from it again."
"115740052-0-37336";"Keep your wits about you. These cultists will flay you alive if you don't strike first!"
"115740052-0-37337";"Now place the items on the altar! That should be enough break the spell! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-37338";"Ah ha! At last!"
"115740052-0-37339";"We're close. I can practically feel the blood flowing in my veins! I'm tingling!"
"115740052-0-37341";"They tore each other apart, right in front of me!"
"115740052-0-37342";"Help me! Destroy the frozen dais, it's where she draws her power!"
"115740052-0-37343";"What did you find?"
"115740052-0-37344";"HoonDing help us. The door is sealed. And without Tu'whacca's Gaze …."
"115740052-0-37345";"Wait, Shelaria. Look there on the floor. More sigils. Perhaps they correspond to the one on the door?"
"115740052-0-37346";"You … you may be right, vampire. Look around. We must keep up the pursuit."
"115740052-0-37347";"You cost us a great harvest. Perhaps your souls will suffice?"
"115740052-0-37348";"These stone husks would have all bore fruit if not for your interference!"
"115740052-0-37349";"You think to kill me? The Ashen Lord will see us all reborn!"
"115740052-0-37352";"I'm not staying here a moment longer! I need to see the sky!"
"115740052-0-37353";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-37354";"Excellent work, assistant! Now, let me give it orders to get us the power node."
"115740052-0-37355";"The energy in here is powerful, don't you think, Claudina? We're onto something!"
"115740052-0-37356";"All right, here go the smelling salts! Get ready with the whistle."
"115740052-0-37361";"Do you hear that? It's coming from upstairs!"
"115740052-0-37363";"Eeek! A spirit!"
"115740052-0-37364";"You there! You shouldn't be in here!"
"115740052-0-37365";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-37366";"Well done, well done! Grab the power node!"
"115740052-0-37367";"You did it! The amulet destroyed the ice!"
"115740052-0-37368";"Come on, he's not getting away!"
"115740052-0-37370";"So, partner, what did you find?"
"115740052-0-37374";"I'm not to be disturbed … unless those two decide to play nice with each other and join me."
"115740052-0-37375";"Look at all this vegetation! How does it even grow down here?"
"115740052-0-37376";"Watch your step, all right? Take it from a Wood Elf—not all plants have your best interests in mind."
"115740052-0-37377";"Jarl Morryn! Rigurt has a new aide! We can talk with the thanes now!"
"115740052-0-37378";"The talks aren't happening, Rigurt. Those fools refuse to set aside their inane feud. Gods, I need a drink."
"115740052-0-37380";"Let's talk, friend."
"115740052-0-37382";"Shelaria! Arta vare! Sleep now."
"115740052-0-37383";"Praying to catch fish, eh? Rigurt just uses a net."
"115740052-0-37386";"Thane Hraldi will not move until this fish is caught. So if we catch it, he will have to go to Rigurt's meeting!"
"115740052-0-37387";"Hmm. The fireplace in the banquet hall? Could be a good place for a hidden passage. Meet you there!"
"115740052-0-37388";"You're back. And by the Whale, you stink! How is that going to help you catch Old Hjaalsdottir?"
"115740052-0-37390";"That sounded promising. Let's try the door."
"115740052-0-37392";"All right. Search the tunnels! Let's find the others."
"115740052-0-37395";"Just watch, Thane Hraldi!"
"115740052-0-37396";"I thought I would never escape. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-37398";"Can you help him, witch?"
"115740052-0-37399";"By Meridia's light! So many dead …."
"115740052-0-37400";"The curse rots his flesh. I've done what I can, but it won't last."
"115740052-0-37404";"Sod off, iceheel. I'd let a giant bed me before I sat at a table with Thane Hraldi."
"115740052-0-37405";"Ha! That happened to Rigurt once! Friend, perhaps you can talk to the thane?"
"115740052-0-37406";"This place is thick with coven members. Be on your guard."
"115740052-0-37408";"Should we really drink with this frostheel?"
"115740052-0-37409";"Who's there? Is that you, high priest—Aaaagh!"
"115740052-0-37411";"By Stuhn, what is this stuff? It's … vile!"
"115740052-0-37416";"Reinforce the palisades! We can't lose the keep!"
"115740052-0-37417";"Please tell me you're our reinforcements. You look like exactly what we need to save Kyne's Aegis."
"115740052-0-37419";"Those urns. They bear the same symbol as the ones I saw in Bangkorai."
"115740052-0-37420";"Triev, Molozu!"
"115740052-0-37423";"That's not right. Try again!"
"115740052-0-37424";"Perfect! Now, pour the solution onto the rocks blocking the entrance."
"115740052-0-37425";"Isn't it just magnificent how Dwemer technology endures?"
"115740052-0-37426";"The spider dislodged the node! Pick it up!"
"115740052-0-37427";"Follow me! We need to regroup!"
"115740052-0-37428";"There we are! Go on and get the node, little one!"
"115740052-0-37429";"Save my pack mates. I'll meet you south of the camp."
"115740052-0-37430";"Good luck. Meet me at the overlook if you find anything."
"115740052-0-37434";"This way! Rally to me!"
"115740052-0-37436";"I heard what you did, iceheel. Go on inside."
"115740052-0-37437";"Rigurt, you bearded ox, get over here! And bring your friend! There's more mead where this came from!"
"115740052-0-37438";"Jarl Morryn is in good spirits! See if she's ready to meet with the Thanes, while Rigurt cleans up!"
"115740052-0-37443";"Let's keep digging while Chief Urzikh plays with her potions!"
"115740052-0-37444";"So, Essenia needs an heir of Verandis? Damn it. What could the Count's bloodline have to do with this?"
"115740052-0-37445";"Ah, good as new. Run along and fetch me my power node, little one."
"115740052-0-37449";"Let's talk outside, partner."
"115740052-0-37462";"This is Svargrim's fault. He should have heeded us from the start."
"115740052-0-37463";"Please. Why did this happen? Why did my mother … I have to know."
"115740052-0-37464";"Retrieve the relic and we can escape through the old airshaft!"
"115740052-0-37465";"We'll need Dwemer spiders to gather the nodes for us. Look for scrap piles. We might find some amidst the chaff."
"115740052-0-37466";"Ha! That's how you earn a place in Sovngarde!"
"115740052-0-37467";"Quickly now, search the scrap heaps for an intact spider I can convince to help us."
"115740052-0-37468";"Hmm, this may take some searching. Look high and low for an inactive spider!"
"115740052-0-37469";"Don't be afraid to be a little brutish with the dormant ones. Sometimes they need a firm touch."
"115740052-0-37470";"Keep going! We'll hold the line here!"
"115740052-0-37471";"There! The master scepter is just beyond those animunculi!"
"115740052-0-37472";"This way, my friend! Let's meet back in the cave!"
"115740052-0-37474";"Wait, do you hear that? Someone's up there."
"115740052-0-37480";"I … suppose that'll work!"
"115740052-0-37481";"Steady! Steady! Not so rough!"
"115740052-0-37482";"Let me just adjust the … come on …."
"115740052-0-37484";"That must be the door Edjar mentioned. Sealed tight. No lock. Not even a handle."
"115740052-0-37485";"I don't suppose the werewolf told you how to open it, did he?"
"115740052-0-37486";"Good work, assistant! We're done here. Let's talk outside."
"115740052-0-37487";"Our own brethren, like vicious animals. We must find the others."
"115740052-0-37488";"We need to walk from here. Follow the path up the mountain."
"115740052-0-37489";"Place looks empty. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-37490";"For Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37491";"That was Fenn! We need to keep moving."
"115740052-0-37492";"Did you have a good time on the water?"
"115740052-0-37493";"Oh, yes! I loved exploring! I can't wait to do it again!"
"115740052-0-37496";"The Palace of Kings, hurry! We must warn Jorunn!"
"115740052-0-37497";"Ninetha? Oh, no. We must act quickly. Use the necklace on my command!"
"115740052-0-37499";"Damn, they're already inside. We must find the Skald-King!"
"115740052-0-37503";"I'll take that as a good sign."
"115740052-0-37507";"Scaffolding. Let's follow it down."
"115740052-0-37508";"Careful, the structure doesn't appear to be completely stable."
"115740052-0-37509";"Relax. It will take more than a rickety structure to take down Lyris Titanborn."
"115740052-0-37510";"Actually, I was more concerned for my own well-being, but if you insist …."
"115740052-0-37513";"Ghosts? Nonsense. Get him to the inn and I'll do what I can."
"115740052-0-37514";"Wolves of ice and bone attacked Brun, my lady! And he saw ghosts!"
"115740052-0-37515";"Tell me truthfully, Lyris … how much of this blood is mine?"
"115740052-0-37516";"Not enough to be worried about."
"115740052-0-37517";"Hey you! Come over here before those zombies get you!"
"115740052-0-37519";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-37521";"You stopped the harrowstorm before it could even get started! Now to deal with the vampire and the witch."
"115740052-0-37522";"Next time, Tharda, the Ashen Lord will expect more than the restoration of a single reliquary. Now deal with the intruders or I'll toss you to the harrowfiends."
"115740052-0-37523";"Damn, we lost them."
"115740052-0-37524";"Gods … did all this death serve some dark purpose?"
"115740052-0-37525";"Jarl Olfwenn! No! I—I need to get some air. Please, recover the crown of Karthald. We can't leave it down here."
"115740052-0-37526";"Hah! Good to see you aren't raising mugs with Ysmir just yet."
"115740052-0-37527";"We saw the storm break, but we heard nothing since you departed for Blackreach."
"115740052-0-37528";"They're here! They're at the gates!"
"115740052-0-37529";"The Gray Host? I thought we were done with them for now!"
"115740052-0-37530";"Not the Gray Host. The Skald-King! With an army from the east!"
"115740052-0-37531";"What treachery is this?"
"115740052-0-37532";"To the gates! We'll give the Skald-King a proper welcome, one way or another."
"115740052-0-37533";"Magister Fridelja, as the highest-ranking official remaining from the court of Karthald, I need you to come to Solitude."
"115740052-0-37536";"Blackreach? So the legends are true? But why is there a town down here?"
"115740052-0-37537";"I'm sorry, Fridelja. Jarl Olfwenn. She's …."
"115740052-0-37538";"Ingenious! A rare thing to find an Elf with the makings of a clever woman."
"115740052-0-37539";"Despite what my kin might proclaim, it's not all in the blood."
"115740052-0-37540";"Ah, good! You're here! We've made a breakthrough!"
"115740052-0-37541";"I've come to warn you, Jarl Reddharn."
"115740052-0-37542";"Warn me? I already received orders from your father. What more is there to say?"
"115740052-0-37543";"Orders? Right … but you need to prepare the hold's defenses."
"115740052-0-37546";"And what must we defend ourselves against this time? More urns and fetishes?"
"115740052-0-37547";"And then Maugh threw up, all over the swordthane's boots!"
"115740052-0-37548";"Hah! This Orc friend of yours sounds—ah, your companions return."
"115740052-0-37550";"You … you killed it? Ha! We might have a chance against Lord Falgravn after all!"
"115740052-0-37551";"Forge ahead! More thanes are mustering in the village. We'll set out again once we reinforce the gates."
"115740052-0-37552";"Why do you refuse my gifts? Why does no one understand the beauty of what I offer?"
"115740052-0-37553";"I give life where there was none! I breathe fire into frozen hearts!"
"115740052-0-37555";"There's no entrance back this far. So, how in Oblivion did they get in?"
"115740052-0-37556";"Look! A breach in the barrow wall. Let's see where it leads."
"115740052-0-37557";"This tunnel looks recently mined. They knew we'd hide in the barrow."
"115740052-0-37558";"The tunnel leads up this way. We must be near the other side of the mountain by now. Let's see where this goes."
"115740052-0-37559";"The Lightless Hollow lies to the east and—Hircine's claws! Who is that tall woman?"
"115740052-0-37561";"More undermined tunnels. So, they burrowed through these caves to sneak up on the town."
"115740052-0-37562";"Still no sign of my people. Why take them back through these caves?"
"115740052-0-37563";"Feels like we're headed back up. This might be the way out."
"115740052-0-37564";"Look at the size of this camp! The Reach is never this organized. Something's changed."
"115740052-0-37566";"I will feed you to the sea!"
"115740052-0-37567";"You mean to escape? All you find here is Yandir. And death."
"115740052-0-37570";"A shame he could not be recruited to our noble cause."
"115740052-0-37571";"The machine will finish him momentarily, my lord."
"115740052-0-37572";"Finish your work here, Tzinghalis, then join me in the keep. You must bear witness when we make our move."
"115740052-0-37573";"Of course, Rada al-Saran. I am eager to see the power of our ultimate harrowstorm."
"115740052-0-37574";"Hafskjar, you need to find Bjora! Go with the stranger. I'll take care of these two."
"115740052-0-37575";"I never thought we'd make it this far north! Lord Falgravn must be nearby."
"115740052-0-37576";"We'll hold this point to make sure their forces are contained."
"115740052-0-37577";"That's the tower Helsi mentioned. The Warleader should be nearby."
"115740052-0-37578";"Stolen queen? Did he mean Bjora? We need to find her."
"115740052-0-37579";"Up ahead! Helsi and the others! They're alive!"
"115740052-0-37583";"Don't worry. Helsi and I can take you to safety. This stranger will scout for Bjora."
"115740052-0-37584";"Wish me luck, Maugh."
"115740052-0-37585";"Forget luck. I suggest a slug of kindlepitch whiskey. You'll need it to stand up to your father."
"115740052-0-37586";"The same. That seems to be all of them for now."
"115740052-0-37587";"The Sea Giants landed in the cove below. Keep a sharp eye out, eh?"
"115740052-0-37589";"How could Meridia let this happen to her faithful?"
"115740052-0-37591";"Enough! When next you come before me to vomit up your counsel, make sure it doesn't stink of treason."
"115740052-0-37593";"Just one more push, and we'll have this vampire by the throat!"
"115740052-0-37594";"Lord Falgravn's in that ruin ahead. He … he took some of my soldiers!"
"115740052-0-37595";"We're no match for that blood-drinker, but you are. Please … save our thanes!"
"115740052-0-37596";"Please, Jarl Reddharn. Let my friend explain. The threat to our holds is worse than you can imagine."
"115740052-0-37599";"Finally! Let's see … legs, arms, stylish coiffure. Yes! Looks like everything's as it should be. What a relief."
"115740052-0-37601";"Thane Svyne! Rigurt prepared an exquisite dish to cure your grumpiness!"
"115740052-0-37602";"We did it friend! He's overcome with bliss! Let's ask him if he's changed his mind."
"115740052-0-37604";"Borfree! Why in Vehk's name did you bring my belongings out onto the street?"
"115740052-0-37605";"Rod?"
"115740052-0-37606";"You dare face me? Baleful power lurks beneath your feet, and I will have it for my own!"
"115740052-0-37608";"The journal is just there on the table."
"115740052-0-37609";"I should warn you: Maelmoth was mad as a sack of weasels. Whatever you intend to do with the text, I doubt it will be worth the effort."
"115740052-0-37611";"You're alive! Mara's mercy, what is this place? I had no idea this was down here."
"115740052-0-37612";"A cruel, bloody business. But the Giants are in retreat, and Lord Falgravn lies slain. We have you to thank."
"115740052-0-37613";"The dead thank you also, from the mead halls of Sovngarde! Perhaps one day, you may drink among them."
"115740052-0-37615";"Essenia means to turn Adusa into one of these beasts? One of these bloodknights? Not on my watch."
"115740052-0-37616";"Master Dren! I'm terribly sorry. I just thought you were hollering so loud, maybe I should let you cool down a bit. And I didn't have any coin for the innkeeper. You, uh … you want some stew?"
"115740052-0-37617";"I most certainly do not! Gather my effects. We look like deranged indigents out here."
"115740052-0-37618";"We. We shall be going to a meditation garden near Kilkreath Temple. I shall meet you there, my trusty assistant!"
"115740052-0-37619";"Ah, there you are! Yes, I'd say this looks like the right place."
"115740052-0-37620";"What's this, then? A lever of some kind?"
"115740052-0-37621";"Well, you did arrive first. Fair's fair. Go ahead and pull it, won't you?"
"115740052-0-37623";"Hrm. Something should … ah ha! Look there!"
"115740052-0-37624";"The old tile-maze puzzle. Child's play."
"115740052-0-37625";"You're free, gods damn it! Run!"
"115740052-0-37629";"Perhaps you should give it a try."
"115740052-0-37637";"Jarl Reddharn, prepare your forces as you say, but we need you in Solitude."
"115740052-0-37638";"Solitude? I have troubles here in Hjaalmarch. Why should I leave when my hold needs me?"
"115740052-0-37639";"High King Svargrim won't listen to us, but he might listen to you."
"115740052-0-37640";"Get up, princess. If you think it will help, I'll talk to your father."
"115740052-0-37641";"Lyris, please escort the jarl to Solitude."
"115740052-0-37642";"Of course. What about you?"
"115740052-0-37643";"We need to warn Jarl Olfwenn, so we're going to Karthald."
"115740052-0-37644";"I need a moment. Let's talk over there."
"115740052-0-37645";"Is that one of the Gray Reliquaries? We can't let them get away with it!"
"115740052-0-37648";"Of course, Princess Svana. I'll help you convince the high king."
"115740052-0-37649";"I feel fine, princess. My spells will get us to Solitude, of that I swear."
"115740052-0-37650";"Hold, friend. You need to hear what I have to say."
"115740052-0-37651";"Watch and learn, assistant!"
"115740052-0-37652";"Agh. Now that I've … graciously shown you what can go wrong, you give it a try."
"115740052-0-37653";"The Gray Host definitely has something big planned. Let's search the tents for a copy of those orders!"
"115740052-0-37654";"Sable-Eye has the brew! Let's find him before he gets away!"
"115740052-0-37655";"Ugh, this place reeks of wet dog and a fungal infection. Must be getting close."
"115740052-0-37656";"Hey, who's there? I can still hear while holding my breath."
"115740052-0-37657";"Look, something appeared! A scroll of some kind."
"115740052-0-37658";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37659";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37660";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37661";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37662";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37663";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37664";"A path of flower petals? Path to a headache, I'd say. Damn this puzzle!"
"115740052-0-37665";"Wait a moment. Can we talk?"
"115740052-0-37667";"Far enough, interlopers! Only my jaws lie ahead."
"115740052-0-37668";"Got something, Pickle? Lead on!"
"115740052-0-37669";"Ah, assistant! Why don't you take a crack at it?"
"115740052-0-37671";"How strange."
"115740052-0-37673";"Adusa! Please! Answer me!"
"115740052-0-37674";"There! There she is!"
"115740052-0-37675";"Gwendis … you came."
"115740052-0-37676";"Of course I did, you mangy scamp! Take a breath, then we're getting you out of here."
"115740052-0-37677";"Z'en's bargain! Would you look at it all? I'm no expert on Dwarves, but I don't think they built half of this."
"115740052-0-37678";"Enough! How dare you interfere with our plans?"
"115740052-0-37679";"You will fall just as easily as the bridge above!"
"115740052-0-37680";"The Reach will be victorious!"
"115740052-0-37681";"No! The bridge must fall! It must!"
"115740052-0-37682";"Do I even dare hope you have another supplier? Or shall I savor this drink?"
"115740052-0-37683";"I thought I might do business with a few trolls, actually. They have excellent mead."
"115740052-0-37684";"That's Fenn's flask. The way he handled it, I can't imagine he'd leave it here on purpose."
"115740052-0-37685";"I need to know … everyone needs to know what happened down there, Thulsgreg."
"115740052-0-37686";"Chief Urzikh, we don't need to do this in public."
"115740052-0-37687";"This clan has suffered enough resentful whispers and bad blood. It's time to clear the air!"
"115740052-0-37690";"That did it! And another scroll. What a surprise …."
"115740052-0-37692";"A bit of machinery? It looks to be of Dwarven make. The mystery deepens!"
"115740052-0-37693";"You get to test my latest formula! Lucky you! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-37694";"Hear your chief! The evidence is clear. Mazog is to blame for the mine disaster. I will take the Blood Price!"
"115740052-0-37695";"This puzzle seems easy enough. It's just a matter of simple deduction. Aha! I have it. Observe!"
"115740052-0-37696";"No …."
"115740052-0-37697";"I'm sorry, Thulsgreg. Tradition demands it."
"115740052-0-37698";"Hear your chief! Mazog made a foolish mistake. But there has been enough bloodshed today."
"115740052-0-37699";"Thank you, Chief Urzikh. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-37700";"As chief, I shoulder the blame as well. We Orcs are slow to forgive. But we will forgive!"
"115740052-0-37701";"Unexpected results."
"115740052-0-37702";"Wrong! I expect better of my assistants. Try again."
"115740052-0-37703";"Arkasis! How did he even get here? He couldn't have gotten past me. Secret passage?"
"115740052-0-37704";"Ever since it took my brother, I've tracked Pale Man sightings across Skyrim."
"115740052-0-37705";"See, on this map. Yes. There and there."
"115740052-0-37706";"Agh!"
"115740052-0-37707";"Yes, yes, you'll do nicely! My assistants aren't fit to put this beauty through its paces, but you … you should yield results!"
"115740052-0-37708";"Failure? A failure? The design was flawless! Your little fly sabotaged my work, didn't she? Didn't she?"
"115740052-0-37709";"Doesn't matter. Give chase. I'll search this laboratory, make sure he doesn't double back again. Two birds, one stone."
"115740052-0-37710";"And these must be the gray reliquaries Fennorian was telling me about. Part of the Gray Host's rituals."
"115740052-0-37711";"This way, my friend!"
"115740052-0-37712";"The road ahead will take you straight to Solitude."
"115740052-0-37713";"Go. Warn Solitude of the danger. I need to make contact with the Ravenwatch."
"115740052-0-37714";"At last! Maelmoth's … wait. Another scroll? By the Three. If this isn't the last one, I quit."
"115740052-0-37715";"The Mysterium awaits! Onward!"
"115740052-0-37716";"Let's go. The way out is just around the bend."
"115740052-0-37717";"This chasm is no obstacle! I'll simply use this!"
"115740052-0-37718";"Finally. Glad I didn't try to bite the energetic git. Think there was more alchemy than blood in his veins."
"115740052-0-37719";"The elixir should do what we need … provided neither Fenn nor I made any miscalculations."
"115740052-0-37720";"At last! Maelmoth's— Wait? What is all this?"
"115740052-0-37721";"We've pretty much cleared the place out. Might be worth studying what's left of this equipment."
"115740052-0-37722";"Go us!"
"115740052-0-37723";"This isn't treasure! This is … junk! Damn that addle-brained wizard! It's just another trick. It has to be!"
"115740052-0-37725";"Look there! An X on the floor. A gate of some kind? Hmm."
"115740052-0-37726";"Gods, more refugees arrive by the hour. Why does Svargrim hesitate?"
"115740052-0-37727";"The high king issues orders, but all they do is lock away the afflicted. When will we strike back?"
"115740052-0-37730";"They've taken it! By the gods, it's fallen!"
"115740052-0-37731";"Fallen? What are you talking about?"
"115740052-0-37732";"The Gray Host, they came out of nowhere! Captured the temple and the Tower of the Wolf! We're locked out!"
"115740052-0-37733";"Then the sacred oil …."
"115740052-0-37735";"Damn it all! I need to get down there!"
"115740052-0-37736";"That's my report, Skald-King. Our friend can tell you more."
"115740052-0-37737";"Move those lovely legs of yours, darling! My belongings won't find themselves!"
"115740052-0-37738";"The cult's summoning ground. Hmph. If I were a Dragon, I'd be wholly unimpressed."
"115740052-0-37739";"I almost pity this new Dragon Cult. I wonder if they know they're just sad, ugly little imitations."
"115740052-0-37740";"You get all the fun! Could you take me out and wave me at the next group of cultists?"
"115740052-0-37741";"If memory serves, this is the cult leader's squalid domain. Be careful, darling."
"115740052-0-37742";"Careful, now. You're far too nice to look at to become a splattered puddle."
"115740052-0-37743";"Come on, let's warm you up."
"115740052-0-37744";"We have everything we need. Now, the altar should be up top somewhere. Hurry, hurry!"
"115740052-0-37745";"A meager harvest! This gray reliquary must be moved to more fruitful fields."
"115740052-0-37746";"Protect the witch pike. Do not let them destroy it!"
"115740052-0-37747";"These corridors lead upward. They should take us to Svargrim and Rada al-Saran."
"115740052-0-37748";"Look, a gray reliquary! It's massive! Just like the storm they plan to unleash on the city!"
"115740052-0-37749";"Impressive. We rarely see such an energetic attunement."
"115740052-0-37750";"Lyris, we found them!"
"115740052-0-37751";"Good. This whole place—the Gray Host is preparing to go to war!"
"115740052-0-37752";"I'm here! Wait for me!"
"115740052-0-37753";"Lead on to the mound!"
"115740052-0-37754";"We need to go to the center of the mound. That's the best place for my spell."
"115740052-0-37755";"Ena! Care to explain the smuggler caves beneath my garrison?"
"115740052-0-37757";"If we survive this, Ena, we are going to have a very long talk."
"115740052-0-37758";"Whatever you say, captain."
"115740052-0-37761";"Here we go."
"115740052-0-37762";"Don't worry, everything's fine! I'm not panicking!"
"115740052-0-37763";"There!"
"115740052-0-37764";"Let's hurry. I don't want to linger here."
"115740052-0-37765";"Here we are. Entirely uneaten!"
"115740052-0-37766";"Good! Now, we just need to make our way to the location the Eye provided. I'll meet you in the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-37767";"Looks like this is the spot. Time to excavate the antiquity!"
"115740052-0-37768";"And there we are! Expertly done!"
"115740052-0-37771";"You don't smell like the Gray Host. Run, before they catch you, too."
"115740052-0-37772";"I'm working fast as I can, you bloodsucking bastards!"
"115740052-0-37773";"Damn vampires, working us like dogs …."
"115740052-0-37777";"So those are the stone husks? Even bigger than I thought."
"115740052-0-37778";"But Captain Ageran is missing now! Who will protect us?"
"115740052-0-37779";"We don't need protection, we're perfectly safe."
"115740052-0-37780";"You're wrong! There's something evil haunting this place! And we're its next victims!"
"115740052-0-37782";"Oh my!"
"115740052-0-37783";"What is it now, Fenn?"
"115740052-0-37784";"Oh, nothing. Just don't look down."
"115740052-0-37785";"Whoa! Do you think that potion caused that?"
"115740052-0-37786";"This is the place, Claudina! The locals say Captain Ageran disappeared from this very spot!"
"115740052-0-37787";"It's locked. We must find a way inside."
"115740052-0-37788";"Is that—? Princess Svana!"
"115740052-0-37790";"I'm certain these are the caves mentioned in the letter. Use the spirit whistle here."
"115740052-0-37791";"More bodies! He's leaving a trail!"
"115740052-0-37792";"That's poison! Why are they spraying it on those plants?"
"115740052-0-37793";"More of that netherroot. Turn off those sprayers or we'll never get across this chamber."
"115740052-0-37794";"It fights against its nature, Rada al-Saran. A weaker breed."
"115740052-0-37795";"No, Tzinghalis. Just the deceived son of an estranged brother, forced to deny his nature."
"115740052-0-37796";"You did it! Now we can cross the chamber."
"115740052-0-37797";"Shor's bones, that stone husk is moving!"
"115740052-0-37798";"Ahh! No! Why are you doing this to me?"
"115740052-0-37799";"Damn it, we need to save Fenn!"
"115740052-0-37800";"The Ashen Lord crafted the plan. I am simply the architect of his tools."
"115740052-0-37801";"Now, feel free to scream when I peel back your flesh and apply this tool …."
"115740052-0-37802";"We have what we need. In his last moments, let him truly understand the power of the Gray Host!"
"115740052-0-37803";"Arrgghh!"
"115740052-0-37806";"Take your time. You've been through a lot."
"115740052-0-37807";"They did whatever they wanted. I couldn't stop them."
"115740052-0-37808";"Hmm, curious. Spirits don't use trapdoors."
"115740052-0-37809";"This must be the camp. Keep an eye out for the captain."
"115740052-0-37810";"Look up the hill! Those ruins were hidden by the storm … is that Verglas Hollow?"
"115740052-0-37813";"Follow him! Now, soldier, tell me exactly what happened."
"115740052-0-37815";"Perhaps I deserve death. I destroy as easily as I create. I taint that which I love."
"115740052-0-37816";"But fret not, your people serve a higher purpose now. I have given them life anew."
"115740052-0-37817";"I will not let my shame snuff out the power I have wrought. I must finish my work."
"115740052-0-37818";"Please, stay calm, everyone. We will find Alchemist Rasir."
"115740052-0-37819";"You did it, friend! Meet us back at the ship!"
"115740052-0-37820";"Muffins! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-37821";"There you are, Muffins!"
"115740052-0-37822";"Oh, my baby! I'm so relieved! \n\nDon't ever scare me like that again!"
"115740052-0-37823";"I'm sure she'll come back, won't she? Oh, she must be so frightened."
"115740052-0-37824";"Don't worry, Muffins! I'm coming to get you!"
"115740052-0-37825";"Attack! Bring them down!"
"115740052-0-37826";"The affliction will catch us too. It's only a matter of time."
"115740052-0-37827";"Nice of you to join us."
"115740052-0-37828";"I don't understand. What am I supposed to do with these flasks?"
"115740052-0-37829";"If we run into trouble, throw one of them at the source. Then get out of the way."
"115740052-0-37830";"Help us, please!"
"115740052-0-37831";"I'm not the first Nord from the East to receive a chilly reception at the Blue Palace. Doubt I'll be the last."
"115740052-0-37832";"The Bards College. Hard to imagine the Skald-King spent his youth studying verse in this stodgy old kingdom."
"115740052-0-37833";"Castle Dour is a monument to the western spirit. Stony and cheerless. Maybe the new tower will liven up the place."
"115740052-0-37835";"There's a fire up by those ruins. Maybe Rasir set up camp there?"
"115740052-0-37836";"Go on, get yourself killed, you old fool! See if I care!"
"115740052-0-37837";"That looks like it might be the last of them."
"115740052-0-37838";"The whole keep … the shaking is getting worse!"
"115740052-0-37839";"So high up, but still far beneath the ground …."
"115740052-0-37840";"Onda! We're not coming in … but please, at least speak to us through the door."
"115740052-0-37841";"Your kind cannot be trusted right now, Tranya!"
"115740052-0-37843";"What did they do to this place?"
"115740052-0-37844";"<Howl>"
"115740052-0-37845";"Behind us!"
"115740052-0-37846";"The harrowfiends, they've broken loose!"
"115740052-0-37847";"Get to the tower and stop Svargrim. We'll hold the gate."
"115740052-0-37848";"Those must be Rasir's things! Let's keep looking up the ridge."
"115740052-0-37849";"We must be on the right trail."
"115740052-0-37850";"I'm with you, my friend. Up the stairs!"
"115740052-0-37853";"Shor's bones, it gets worse each day. My mother's cousin says her neighbor's disappeared."
"115740052-0-37854";"Everyone has a story of someone going missing. Are any of them true?"
"115740052-0-37855";"That storm over Kilkreath, like punishment from the gods!"
"115740052-0-37856";"A Daedric temple, who knows what they're doing over there."
"115740052-0-37857";"Who's that? If you came to eat me, you better turn right around!"
"115740052-0-37858";"Assassins tried to kill the high king! They murdered Queen Gerhyld!"
"115740052-0-37859";"Our poor high king must be devastated. The princess, too. What a sad day."
"115740052-0-37860";"That voice … it sends a chill through me. That must be Favrete."
"115740052-0-37861";"It's true, the Reach attacked Morthal! The jarl's soldiers put a stop to it, as I understand it."
"115740052-0-37862";"That's nothing! I heard something happened in Karthald. Karthwatch was destroyed!"
"115740052-0-37863";"First he hid in that ghastly Tower of the Wolf. Now I hear the high king has fled the city."
"115740052-0-37864";"That can't be true! High King Svargrim would never abandon us! Would he?"
"115740052-0-37866";"Is the storm over? Are we safe? And did you see how much damage the Tower of the Wolf sustained?"
"115740052-0-37867";"Everything will be all right. The princess and her allies stopped the harrowstorm and killed the treacherous high king."
"115740052-0-37868";"Iceheels walking the streets of Solitude? What's our hold coming to?"
"115740052-0-37869";"Quiet, you! Princess Svana and her allies saved us all—and one of them was an eastern half-giant!"
"115740052-0-37870";"Assassin! Murderer! He's loose in the city!"
"115740052-0-37871";"Shor's bones, where are the guards?"
"115740052-0-37874";"There's trouble in Haafingar. Something about a strange storm at Kilkreath Temple. Priests and pilgrims were wiped out."
"115740052-0-37875";"Poor sods. I heard Jarl Reddharn has ordered the soldiers to search the hold. I wonder what they're looking for?"
"115740052-0-37878";"Those Reachmen defiled our barrow! If not for the eastern half-giant and her companion, we would have suffered the same fate as Karthald!"
"115740052-0-37879";"Poor Karthwatch. How will they ever come back from a disaster such as this?"
"115740052-0-37880";"Harrowstorms, spreading like a plague. They say the Gray Host is to blame. That High King Svargrim has joined them."
"115740052-0-37881";"What will the kingdom do with no one to lead us?"
"115740052-0-37882";"Did you see it? The storm over Solitude? I thought it was going to consume the city!"
"115740052-0-37883";"I'm just glad it's over now. I heard the princess was forced to kill her own father!"
"115740052-0-37884";"Jarl Reddharn sent word. Until a moot can be called, Princess Svana will govern the kingdom."
"115740052-0-37885";"The princess? She's young, but she handled this crisis well. Her mother would be proud."
"115740052-0-37888";"Look! They're both alive!"
"115740052-0-37889";"Those new arrivals. They didn't stop in Dusktown. Went straight for those Dwarven ruins."
"115740052-0-37890";"I thought we were trying to keep this place a secret? And they sure didn't look like miners to me."
"115740052-0-37891";"Those howls we used to hear. Turns out they were werewolves!"
"115740052-0-37892";"Down here? They sounded like caged dogs. I hope someone set them free."
"115740052-0-37893";"Those tremors and shakes, I heard it was a vampire ritual of some sort in the northern caverns."
"115740052-0-37894";"That's it! As soon as I can get out of this contract, I'm leaving this place!"
"115740052-0-37895";"This is not VO"
"115740052-0-37896";"All this time, the overseer was working with a vampire? I knew there was something unpleasant about him!"
"115740052-0-37897";"All those people disappeared and the overseer was behind it all along? That's terrible!"
"115740052-0-37898";"Quickly, to me. Our time is short."
"115740052-0-37899";"I can't believe the jarl's daughter is back! She's grown so much, hasn't she?"
"115740052-0-37900";"She appears in good health and unharmed. I wonder where she was all this time?"
"115740052-0-37901";"They say that anyone not killed by the storm at Kilkreath turned into a monster."
"115740052-0-37902";"Worse than that, if they weren't killed or turned into a monster, they became mindless zombies!"
"115740052-0-37903";"Pleased to see you in Solitude, stranger!"
"115740052-0-37907";"Kill … you … kill …!"
"115740052-0-37910";"Partner! Could really use your knack for diplomacy right now. Speak to the Skald-King before we start a war."
"115740052-0-37911";"Hurry! Use the necklace. Release the energy within!"
"115740052-0-37912";"Wha … what's happening?"
"115740052-0-37913";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37914";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37915";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37916";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37917";"Honor to the fallen!"
"115740052-0-37918";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37919";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37920";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37921";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37922";"We stand and we remain!"
"115740052-0-37923";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37924";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37925";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37926";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37927";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37928";"The fallen now march home to hallowed halls."
"115740052-0-37929";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37930";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37931";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37932";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37933";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37934";"To join our ancestors in boundless drink, and song, and brawls."
"115740052-0-37941";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37942";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37943";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37944";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37945";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37946";"Let sound the horns! Let peal the bells! Let loose the ancient hymn!"
"115740052-0-37947";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37948";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37949";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37950";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37951";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37952";"We will remain until time ends! We children of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-37953";"Watch out!"
"115740052-0-37954";"Help! Over here!"
"115740052-0-37955";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-37956";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-37957";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-37960";"Yes, that's … better. Thank you. I could feel my control slipping away."
"115740052-0-37962";"Keep at it! No one stops digging until we break through."
"115740052-0-37967";"Now where did I put those runestones …."
"115740052-0-37971";"Remember to move cautiously. Use the right tool for the right level of excavation, and don't rush yourself!"
"115740052-0-37972";"Even careful digging can result in an unsteady dig site. So, be mindful of its stability!"
"115740052-0-37973";"How about some comparison testing?"
"115740052-0-37974";"Bah! Bloody mages and their bloody tricks."
"115740052-0-37975";"Well done. Now, fix your eyes on the center and the corners of the lens, then turn your focus inward toward the facets in the glass. Concentrate, and the facets should merge."
"115740052-0-37976";"Unifying the lens into a single pattern will perfectly attune the Eye, but you only need to reach the foci to gain a rough idea of the object's location. If you lose your focus, just try again."
"115740052-0-37977";"<Clunk>"
"115740052-0-37978";"Such sloppy magic … untrained."
"115740052-0-37988";"Quickly, up here!"
"115740052-0-37989";"Okay. Shouldn't be but a moment. Just need to find the proper … there it is!"
"115740052-0-37990";"Oof! A bit more … There! Hit the lever now!"
"115740052-0-37991";"Wait … something's coming! Go! Get to safety! I'll draw them away."
"115740052-0-37992";"You cannot stop us. Dragons will once again rule the skies!"
"115740052-0-37993";"Are you sure about this, my love? What if something goes wrong?"
"115740052-0-37994";"Absolutely. I've researched this ritual for years. I just need your help."
"115740052-0-37995";"Where are you, Adusa? Wait—you there! What do you want?"
"115740052-0-37996";"So nice to be out with the ones that you love."
"115740052-0-37997";"We owe you our lives."
"115740052-0-37999";"Let's start with the courtyard. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-38000";"What is it, Pickle?"
"115740052-0-38001";"We'll never make it out of here!"
"115740052-0-38002";"Good boy!"
"115740052-0-38003";"Well done! Can your shovels and pickaxes compete with that, Thulsgreg?"
"115740052-0-38004";"Even a blind echatere finds a pumpkin once in a while. It was luck and nothing more … chief."
"115740052-0-38005";"Ugh. This place is crawling with Essenia's troops. They've got to be protecting something. Let's just hope it's an entrance."
"115740052-0-38006";"I left a copy of Nel's Hidden Loves on the table there. Have a look."
"115740052-0-38007";"Quiet down! We're not here to harm you. I promise."
"115740052-0-38008";"Outsiders! Surface-dwellers!"
"115740052-0-38009";"It's that way, isn't it? The caves? Thank you. I promise, this will all be over soon."
"115740052-0-38010";"We'll likely find worse things than this inside the keep. Come on. Let's find this door."
"115740052-0-38011";"Mother Wolf, hear me! We seek your blessing in our hunt. Lead us to our elusive quarry."
"115740052-0-38012";"A camp? And look! The magic points to the west!"
"115740052-0-38013";"My, what a view. It's almost romantic. Or it would be, if I wasn't a doll!"
"115740052-0-38014";"Isn't this lovely? Living underground like rats. The mighty Dragon Cult, indeed."
"115740052-0-38015";"The assassin drained her of blood."
"115740052-0-38016";"Yes, this is definitely the place in the vision. I'll slip past and scout ahead."
"115740052-0-38017";"Bah! I'll deal with you next time, you fangless cur."
"115740052-0-38018";"I didn't get a good look at that before. Mind bringing it over?"
"115740052-0-38019";"Don't you ever give up the chase?"
"115740052-0-38020";"I kept you busy long enough. Sister Tharda shall revive the exarchs!"
"115740052-0-38021";"Now we need to find Sister Tharda."
"115740052-0-38022";"That's for Queen Gerhyld, you bastard."
"115740052-0-38023";"I already told Jarl Morryn, if Thane Svyne attends this meeting, I will not. Now let me finish the rite of the Whale."
"115740052-0-38025";"There is no rest for the wicked!"
"115740052-0-38026";"Oh, Edjar … where are you?"
"115740052-0-38028";"That is absolutely not what I sa—"
"115740052-0-38029";"Friend, meet Rigurt at Chillwind Depths. He has a plan to catch this slippery horker's daughter!"
"115740052-0-38030";"Rigurt is glad to see you, friend! This place makes his armpit hairs stand up!"
"115740052-0-38031";"That's it! Rigurt remembers that stink! He will take it back to Thane Hraldi at once!"
"115740052-0-38032";"This looks promising. Let's just hope it leads to Adusa."
"115740052-0-38034";"Wait, where's your fishing rod?"
"115740052-0-38035";"Claudina, say more about your process! I want to capture everything in my notes!"
"115740052-0-38036";"Be silent, churl. I won't tell you again!"
"115740052-0-38037";"Adusa? Adusa, are you here?"
"115740052-0-38038";"Adusa? The Khajiit? I know where she is, Elf! Release us and I'll tell you!"
"115740052-0-38039";"Watch out for giant bugs. They poisoned my sister!"
"115740052-0-38040";"A camp? Could the stories about underground humanoids be true?"
"115740052-0-38041";"I never would have gotten this far without your help. Let's be careful and find the rest of what I need."
"115740052-0-38042";"I don't understand. Old Hjaalsdottir … is a horker?!"
"115740052-0-38043";"By the spirits … that wake! It's Old Hjaalsdottir!"
"115740052-0-38044";"Good work, friend! Rigurt will find Thane Svyne! Meet him there!"
"115740052-0-38045";"Good work, friend! Rigurt will meet you at Jarl Morryn's Cabin!"
"115740052-0-38046";"Slow down, Phebe! Be vigilant, not hurried!"
"115740052-0-38047";"Ah, Elle! No worries here! All part of the process, I assure you!"
"115740052-0-38048";"We need to stick to the river, friend! You're going the wrong way!"
"115740052-0-38050";"He must have been desperate to feed while trying to escape."
"115740052-0-38051";"We need to talk."
"115740052-0-38052";"Shor's bones! This cavern! Such an unnatural glow. How did the Reachmen discover this?"
"115740052-0-38053";"All right, you're safe. Now talk."
"115740052-0-38054";"Pull the lever once more, assistant. That should … that should reset the puzzle."
"115740052-0-38055";"Punish the servants of Molag Bal, child. They cower below."
"115740052-0-38056";"Behold, a lamb fit only for slaughter. Eviscerate it!"
"115740052-0-38057";"Evisceration trades pain for pain, child. The more grievous your wounds, the more pain you inflict. Remember this."
"115740052-0-38058";"This pathetic churl squanders its life. Drain it from them in my name!"
"115740052-0-38059";"Draining a foe's essence allows you to mend your wounds. Put their miserable lives to good use."
"115740052-0-38060";"Keep back, the barrow is unsafe!"
"115740052-0-38061";"Jarl Reddharn sent us. What happened here?"
"115740052-0-38062";"Reachmen. Let's talk if you want details."
"115740052-0-38063";"Smells too bland! Spice the meat, friend!"
"115740052-0-38064";"The meat's getting too dry! Use the howlwater!"
"115740052-0-38065";"The meat's tougher than a mudcrab's shell! Let's soften it up!"
"115740052-0-38066";"No, that's not right! We should start over."
"115740052-0-38067";"No, no, no. I used that one to illustrate the consequences of hasty choices, remember?"
"115740052-0-38069";"Ah, that's better. Now, let's talk."
"115740052-0-38070";"Shor's bullocks, man, do you mean to drive me mad with that scent?"
"115740052-0-38071";"This — this is sodding wonderful! But there's a taste I can't place?"
"115740052-0-38072";"Oh … oh no."
"115740052-0-38073";"Meddlesome miscreants inside the Mysterium! Ho ho! Take this!"
"115740052-0-38074";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-38075";"Kireth? Is that you? It's been so long …."
"115740052-0-38076";"Raynor! You're alive! We don't have much time … I can feel it pulling at me already!"
"115740052-0-38077";"I thought I'd lost you!"
"115740052-0-38078";"The meat's drying out again! Give it another splash!"
"115740052-0-38079";"Soften it up again, friend!"
"115740052-0-38080";"Hmph. Hardly the majestic retreat I was expecting. Wait. Look there! Another door."
"115740052-0-38081";"Locked. Say, is that a key on the pedestal? Snatch it up quick!"
"115740052-0-38082";"Not trapped? Good! Now, let's finally get a look at Maelmoth's mysteries!"
"115740052-0-38084";"Good work, friend! Rigurt will find Thane Hraldi! Meet him there!"
"115740052-0-38085";"More journal pages! Quickly, let's see if we can find another!"
"115740052-0-38086";"Jarl Morryn. Rigurt. Am I early?"
"115740052-0-38087";"Er … not at all! Rigurt and his assistant just need to finalize preparations! A word, friend!"
"115740052-0-38088";"Thane Svyne, don't think my being here means I've forgotten the New Life festival."
"115740052-0-38089";"Will someone thank Thane Hraldi for facing away from me, so I don't have to look at his pissing beard?"
"115740052-0-38090";"Look at all these bottles. Did you start without us, Jarl Morryn?"
"115740052-0-38091";"Well, I actually, hm."
"115740052-0-38092";"Ha! My kind of diplomacy! Speaking of, we've got some talking to do, don't we?"
"115740052-0-38093";"Yes. I must second my corpulent peer's point. Let's discuss this treaty of yours."
"115740052-0-38094";"Of course! Right away, your thane-inesses!"
"115740052-0-38095";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-38096";"Assistant! Are you there? Damn you, Maelmoth!"
"115740052-0-38097";"Right. Well. You must be pleased with yourself. Just take me back to Solitude. Ridiculous …."
"115740052-0-38098";"It's working! You've done it!"
"115740052-0-38099";"Rasir, you're alive! Thank the Gods."
"115740052-0-38100";"A dead end. Damn it. No signs of an arboretum or laboratory. There's got to be a way through!"
"115740052-0-38101";"Ah, the Maelmoth historian."
"115740052-0-38103";"More weak-minded cattle. Mesmerize it. Bend it to your will."
"115740052-0-38104";"Mesmerism allows a vampire to stun their prey. A helpless meal tastes all the sweeter."
"115740052-0-38105";"Now, kill these worms until your blood quickens. Call upon my power to unleash your true form!"
"115740052-0-38106";"Yes. Mortals quake at the approach of a Blood Scion. You have done well, child. Return to my sanctum."
"115740052-0-38107";"There we are. Oh, Narsis. You really tie the room together. Ha!"
"115740052-0-38108";"Hey! Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-38109";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-38113";"Friend, see if you can convince Thane Hraldi to talk to us."
"115740052-0-38114";"After we resupply and get ourselves out of this ice, we can get underway again."
"115740052-0-38115";"Fine work, Drigsen. I'm proud of this crew, as always."
"115740052-0-38116";"Quickly, you fools! They come for the reliquaries!"
"115740052-0-38117";"Too bad you arrived so late. Your life energy would fit perfectly in my reliquaries!"
"115740052-0-38119";"You dare? These reliquaries belong to the Ashen Lord!"
"115740052-0-38120";"Protect the gray reliquary with your lives!"
"115740052-0-38121";"My sisters will avenge me!"
"115740052-0-38122";"You could not stop the harrowstorm, and you cannot stop me!"
"115740052-0-38123";"One of the miners. Poor bastard. Sorry we were too late."
"115740052-0-38124";"This is the part of fishering where we run after the fish, yes? Let's go, friend!"
"115740052-0-38125";"That's Rigurt's secretest ingredient: powdered hagraven squeezings!"
"115740052-0-38127";"Why does everything connected to vampires involve blood?"
"115740052-0-38128";"Looks like Edjar was telling the truth. They were experimenting on the werewolves."
"115740052-0-38129";"That note … this place is even worse than I thought. Come on. Let's find a use for that pass phrase."
"115740052-0-38130";"A secret door. Of course the lunatic alchemist has a secret door. Let's go."
"115740052-0-38131";"Turn those valves and see if you can disable the sprayers."
"115740052-0-38132";"Examine the headstones. Let's determine what's so special about the exhumed bodies."
"115740052-0-38133";"Pickle seems to be onto something. You search the camp while I see what he's onto."
"115740052-0-38134";"Intruders? No! The ritual is almost complete. Deal with them."
"115740052-0-38135";"You're too late! The experiment nears completion. The heir of Verandis is mine!"
"115740052-0-38136";"Gwendis! Help me!"
"115740052-0-38137";"Finally, Verandis's essence is mine! Behold, Bal's curse … perfected!"
"115740052-0-38138";"<Anguished scream>"
"115740052-0-38139";"Adusa! Get up! Please!"
"115740052-0-38140";"Adusa …. We have to find her. Come on!"
"115740052-0-38141";"Come on. Those bloodknights will be on top of us any moment now. I'll take care of Adusa. You go on. Meet us at my camp outside, all right?"
"115740052-0-38142";"We're wasting time, just go."
"115740052-0-38143";"Stop them, my pack mates! I'll get this brew to the witches!"
"115740052-0-38145";"There goes another one. You've almost got it."
"115740052-0-38147";"No! Not when we're so close …."
"115740052-0-38148";"A body? This has to be the vampire's doing! I bet he didn't stop at one …. Look for more!"
"115740052-0-38149";"I left the orders in my tent, but the Ashen Lord was clear. We need more netherroot. See to the Undergrove immediately."
"115740052-0-38150";"As you command, pentarch."
"115740052-0-38151";"Exarch Tzinghalis has fallen. I have never seen Rada al-Saran, our Ashen Lord, so filled with sorrow. Or such rage."
"115740052-0-38152";"Does the loss of the exarch alter our plans?"
"115740052-0-38153";"Not in the least. The strike on Solitude will occur as planned, after Exarch Ulfra tests the improved ritual in the Undergrove."
"115740052-0-38154";"Wait for us, boy!"
"115740052-0-38155";"I'll take that as conclusive proof that that is not the correct door. Try another."
"115740052-0-38156";"We shouldn't linger, Edjar. The Gray Host could find us at any moment."
"115740052-0-38157";"Gather as many documents as you can carry. They could all shine new light on the Gray Host's plans."
"115740052-0-38158";"The Undergrove? That sounds important."
"115740052-0-38159";"An attack on Solitude? We need to move quickly!"
"115740052-0-38160";"Why do you resist? I will bring our people to power!"
"115740052-0-38161";"Look, on the scaffold! Let's eavesdrop on those werewolves."
"115740052-0-38162";"There, on the lift! Let's listen in."
"115740052-0-38163";"You will not leave here alive!"
"115740052-0-38164";"Arise, and destroy these fools!"
"115740052-0-38165";"You will not defeat me!"
"115740052-0-38166";"Thank you, stranger. That meat will do us good."
"115740052-0-38167";"You will not defeat me! I am unmatched!"
"115740052-0-38168";"Your fortitude is commendable, but it is beginning to bore me."
"115740052-0-38169";"Braugh na nog macgamhain. Braugh na nog karuu. Dur ma murdin braugh harbour!"
"115740052-0-38173";"Help! Gods, somebody please save me!"
"115740052-0-38174";"Hmm. This one is so very thirsty … can we drink from him yet?"
"115740052-0-38175";"Help! Please!"
"115740052-0-38176";"Enough screaming! This one thinks we should just kill him now."
"115740052-0-38177";"No, please don't! I'm not any good!"
"115740052-0-38178";"Oh, this one will save him."
"115740052-0-38179";"Oh, yes. What a lovely idea."
"115740052-0-38180";"Just a taste, then."
"115740052-0-38181";"By the Gods, please, someone save me!"
"115740052-0-38182";"Perhaps we should feed him to the dog."
"115740052-0-38183";"Not too much. We need him alive to be harrowed."
"115740052-0-38184";"No one is coming to save you, fool."
"115740052-0-38185";"Look at them all, together …."
"115740052-0-38186";"Freiwen? Why don't you go down? Spend time with others?"
"115740052-0-38187";"How can I? I caused so much pain. What if I don't belong here anymore?"
"115740052-0-38188";"Oh, darling. Everything will be all right, in time."
"115740052-0-38189";"I will kill you!"
"115740052-0-38190";"Mauloch's jawbone … what happened in here?"
"115740052-0-38191";"Use the stonemelt solution on the boulders and get us out of here!"
"115740052-0-38192";"Brave, are we?"
"115740052-0-38194";"I … I don't know what to say …."
"115740052-0-38195";"You're back! Lyris was just making introductions and was about to give her report. Why don't you tell me what happened."
"115740052-0-38196";"Freiwen? Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-38197";"Am … am I? Mother, I thought I'd killed you!"
"115740052-0-38198";"I would never leave you. It's over now."
"115740052-0-38199";"Agh! It burns! Mother!"
"115740052-0-38203";"Rest. Then we shall return to town. You two have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-38205";"The panels are all different. I wonder what they mean?"
"115740052-0-38206";"The gears started moving. You must be doing something right."
"115740052-0-38207";"Just as I feared…. Come, listen to a tale."
"115740052-0-38208";"Of course, my dear! Go ahead and grab some seed."
"115740052-0-38209";"Can I feed the chickens, Havil?"
"115740052-0-38210";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-38212";"That coven witch, is she the one that escaped from the barrow?"
"115740052-0-38213";"Kill Urgala! Maybe that will stop the storm from growing!"
"115740052-0-38214";"Yrsild … my little owlet. Your grandfather was right. You came."
"115740052-0-38215";"Hjarnam? What are you doing here? What's happened to you?"
"115740052-0-38216";"Rest in glory, Hjarnam. I will finish what you and my grandfather started. I swear it."
"115740052-0-38217";"Help? I need no help from the likes of you."
"115740052-0-38221";"We need to get up the ramp and onto the walls! That's our way to the Tower of the Wolf!"
"115740052-0-38222";"Something turned on. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-38223";"If you want something done right you have to do it yourself."
"115740052-0-38224";"I see some hands-on testing is required."
"115740052-0-38225";"Over here, partner."
"115740052-0-38226";"Father, how could you? All these deaths … just to fulfill whatever mad dream you had for Skyrim."
"115740052-0-38227";"Father … look what you brought us to. I'll never forgive you."
"115740052-0-38238";"Fools! Meddlers! You've walked into the very crucible of creation! In this realm, I am god! I will oversee your unmaking from on high!"
"115740052-0-38239";"You've starved a few bloodknights of my precious formula. I'll just have to prepare an infusion of your blood!"
"115740052-0-38240";"How am I to test my superior bloodknights when you've ruined the entire batch? I'll have to start all over with you!"
"115740052-0-38241";"You have your orders, thane. I trust you know enough to carry them out."
"115740052-0-38242";"I have your betrayal penned in your hand and stained in our blood!"
"115740052-0-38243";"Seal him in."
"115740052-0-38246";"Another traveler approaches. Come, warm yourself."
"115740052-0-38247";"Those bodies. They're the jarl's soldiers."
"115740052-0-38249";"Willing sacrifices? How nice!"
"115740052-0-38250";"Sacrifice? I'd rather give you my axe, witch!"
"115740052-0-38251";"Ah hah! You've done it!"
"115740052-0-38252";"Stand down. I'm a friend."
"115740052-0-38253";"Seems fairly quiet here so far, Talfyg. You're not misleading me, are you?"
"115740052-0-38254";"I swear, what I told you is true. I see no need for this distrust between us."
"115740052-0-38255";"Showing me a spooky castle proves nothing, Talfyg. Get us inside without drawing attention, then I'll decide how to feel about you."
"115740052-0-38256";"Then maybe we could move faster, hmm? I'd like to get in before the fiends see us."
"115740052-0-38257";"We're here. Let's find this assassin."
"115740052-0-38258";"The door's over here. Hurry, before they spot us."
"115740052-0-38272";"I thought I heard a bit of a scuffle up here."
"115740052-0-38273";"Honestly, I'm surprised to see you again. I thought the guard dog would make short work."
"115740052-0-38274";"You should be pleased. No need to fear with us around."
"115740052-0-38275";"Ah! Look there. A book! Step lively, assistant. Have a look at that tome while I piece this together."
"115740052-0-38276";"Hmm, it is quite fine. Why, this might be cut from diamond!"
"115740052-0-38277";"Yes, this will make all the nonsense worthwhile, I know it!"
"115740052-0-38278";"We'll start with something simple. I buried an old bottle in the courtyard. Open your journal and have a look."
"115740052-0-38279";"What is this? Damn it, Talfyg, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-38280";"Your blood flows strong, Gwendis! My lady has need of you. But she has no use for the others."
"115740052-0-38281";"Maybe this bottle of ancient pickles is worth something …. No. No, this weathered shoe is the real prize!"
"115740052-0-38282";"I simply cannot wait to throw Narsis Dren's next opus in the waste bin. He's a terrible writer. I won't allow his books on my shelves!"
"115740052-0-38283";"Go on ahead. I'm going to poke through some of this stuff and see what Arkasis is up to."
"115740052-0-38284";"Brigvar!"
"115740052-0-38285";"Fenn's delirious. See if you can free him!"
"115740052-0-38287";"Get back here you overgrown pestle pusher!"
"115740052-0-38288";"A bug, sire? Ah! D-don't come near Master Arkasis!"
"115740052-0-38289";"Poor chumps. Keep going! We've almost got him cornered!"
"115740052-0-38290";"No time to mull it over. If anyone knows, it'll be Mugha. He was probably on the scaffolding managing the evacuation. Head up there and look for him."
"115740052-0-38292";"Hang on Fenn! Come on, let's make Tzinghalis pay."
"115740052-0-38293";"No sign of Arkasis yet. Keep going. I'll follow your trail of destruction with one of my own."
"115740052-0-38294";"I think I'm beginning to understand the process."
"115740052-0-38295";"At least enough to break it anyway."
"115740052-0-38296";"This is starting to get fun."
"115740052-0-38297";"Think I found something. Old notes. Really old."
"115740052-0-38298";"No! You won't get away so easily!"
"115740052-0-38299";"Talfyg … got away."
"115740052-0-38300";"He moved so fast …. Just caught me by surprise."
"115740052-0-38301";"Gods above … what vile evil is this?"
"115740052-0-38302";"I think I know where to find Lady Thorn. Push on to the cathedral while I search for clues here."
"115740052-0-38303";"How dare you reject Lady Thorn's offer? Look! Tremble before the power you might have wielded!"
"115740052-0-38304";"Glad to be rid of that worm. He deserved worse."
"115740052-0-38305";"The cathedral isn't too far ahead. Lady Thorn should be inside."
"115740052-0-38306";"You found what remains of the prisoners. Such brutality."
"115740052-0-38307";"Wait … look at all these documents."
"115740052-0-38308";"There's information here about Lady Thorn … and the Gray Host. I need to study this."
"115740052-0-38309";"It's over. The ancient clan of Lady Thorn is no more. Good riddance."
"115740052-0-38312";"You can handle this. I refuse to let him win!"
"115740052-0-38313";"Well this explains some things. What have you become Talfyg?"
"115740052-0-38314";"There's no running away this time, monster!"
"115740052-0-38315";"Rise and feast!"
"115740052-0-38317";"Well this isn't at all what I expected. What happened here?"
"115740052-0-38318";"Nice camp, I suppose."
"115740052-0-38319";"Find the scholars, but try not to get eaten by anything!"
"115740052-0-38320";"Psst! Over here!"
"115740052-0-38321";"I'll hurry back to Scholar Diel's camp. Be safe!"
"115740052-0-38322";"You there! Come."
"115740052-0-38323";"I will return to Scholar Diel's camp. May Tall Papa guide your steps."
"115740052-0-38324";"Come forward, you godless mongrel!"
"115740052-0-38325";"Lead on, wayfarer."
"115740052-0-38326";"The exit! Let us see the sky once more."
"115740052-0-38327";"Enough playtime. I thirst for blood!"
"115740052-0-38328";"Now witness the fury of blood!"
"115740052-0-38329";"The blood runs weak!"
"115740052-0-38330";"Every scratch, every cut, the power in your veins fills the air. This meal will be the finest in years!"
"115740052-0-38331";"Release the power within your blood! Let the feast begin!"
"115740052-0-38332";"Come, let me drink your strength."
"115740052-0-38333";"I hunger for more!"
"115740052-0-38334";"Now witness the fury of blood!"
"115740052-0-38335";"Release the power within your blood! Let the feast begin!"
"115740052-0-38336";"My lord … will … hear of this."
"115740052-0-38337";"I will go check on the scholars at Diel's camp. Thank you again, wayfarer."
"115740052-0-38338";"There you are!"
"115740052-0-38339";"I'll meet you at Viridian Watch!"
"115740052-0-38340";"There's a sigil! Right there! Don't you see it?"
"115740052-0-38341";"There's a sigil here! You see it too, right?"
"115740052-0-38342";"Another one. Keep going west."
"115740052-0-38343";"South here. Not that we have a choice."
"115740052-0-38344";"East, down that tunnel."
"115740052-0-38345";"Let's go south, up those steps."
"115740052-0-38346";"East here, and down again."
"115740052-0-38347";"Another one. Northeast, around this corner."
"115740052-0-38348";"Keep going straight, I think we're close."
"115740052-0-38349";"Nope, nothing that way."
"115740052-0-38350";"Look!"
"115740052-0-38351";"Ha! This must be it! Now, how to go about opening it?"
"115740052-0-38352";"That's done it! Let's check inside!"
"115740052-0-38353";"Wait, what's that? Let me see it."
"115740052-0-38354";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-38355";"This way. The door's over here."
"115740052-0-38356";"And down we go."
"115740052-0-38357";"There you are. We have a problem."
"115740052-0-38358";"Got you!"
"115740052-0-38360";"Watch out for vermin. We don't fumigate down here as often as we should."
"115740052-0-38361";"Begin enervation testing! Choose your targets!"
"115740052-0-38363";"You sure you're reading that map right?"
"115740052-0-38364";"Yes, I'm sure. And no, it's not upside down or written in Ta'agra. It's just … vague. Treasure maps are never specific."
"115740052-0-38365";"Take all the time you need. The Antiquarian Circle pays by the hour, after all."
"115740052-0-38366";"Anything worth reporting about the contents of that note?"
"115740052-0-38368";"Let's hurry to the cellar. I'm fairly certain I can get it unlocked."
"115740052-0-38369";"Give me a moment."
"115740052-0-38370";"Hurry now, inside."
"115740052-0-38372";"Another secret door? I didn't know that was here. It has the same mark as the signet. Maybe …."
"115740052-0-38373";"It opened! Let's see what's inside."
"115740052-0-38374";"That letter. What does it say?"
"115740052-0-38378";"I don't believe this! How could you forget a shovel?"
"115740052-0-38379";"Hey, you were in charge of the supplies."
"115740052-0-38380";"I'm going to play with the guar while you two argue."
"115740052-0-38381";"Wait, which rock? There are a lot of rocks out here!"
"115740052-0-38382";"That's what it looks like, a rock. Marked with a Daedra brand."
"115740052-0-38383";"This is ridiculous, I'll be old and you'll be dead by the time we find anything!"
"115740052-0-38384";"My orders were to wait, Lyris. At least Rada left something in his haste."
"115740052-0-38385";"Damn it! I knew we should have attacked when we had the chance!"
"115740052-0-38386";"Wait—is that you, partner? Could have used you a moment sooner."
"115740052-0-38388";"Heck of a guard dog. Take him for a run. I'll work on the door."
"115740052-0-38389";"There you are! That darkness Arana mentioned? I think we found it!"
"115740052-0-38393";"He escaped, count, but we intercepted this letter."
"115740052-0-38394";"A moment, Fennorian. The darkness … has passed. Well done acquiring this letter."
"115740052-0-38395";"Never mind the pat on the back, Verandis! What happened?"
"115740052-0-38396";"It's nothing. A distraction. Our friend has arrived and we must not waste any time."
"115740052-0-38397";"Perfect timing, my friend. I think the Dark Heart is close by."
"115740052-0-38405";"Over here! Nighthollow Keep is just ahead."
"115740052-0-38406";"Hey, the archive is this way. Fine. I'll keep an eye on the place while you do whatever."
"115740052-0-38407";"There you are! See if you can find a personal object within this ancient study."
"115740052-0-38408";"Look how high that netherroot's growing. Think it will hold our weight?"
"115740052-0-38409";"Hmm. Lock looks pretty old. Think you can crack it?"
"115740052-0-38411";"That did it! Quickly, now. Question the shade before it dissipates!"
"115740052-0-38413";"Help … me …."
"115740052-0-38414";"That's done. Hey—why is this trinket over here glowing?"
"115740052-0-38415";"Beneath stars and spheres? What does that even mean?"
"115740052-0-38416";"A gift for me, my love?"
"115740052-0-38419";"I have chosen. Tonight, you and Rhainne will drink from the Dark Heart."
"115740052-0-38420";"I have longed for this moment, my lady."
"115740052-0-38421";"Soon you will be a lord of the Nighthollow clan. One of my chosen!"
"115740052-0-38427";"What is that thing? Did it just pulse at me?"
"115740052-0-38428";"Dwarven locks are tricky even without all the howling, but I got it. Come on!"
"115740052-0-38433";"Well done! Let's go deal with the rest of the ward crystals."
"115740052-0-38436";"I'll meet you down in Blackreach!"
"115740052-0-38437";"The keystone is only part of the puzzle. As you agreed, we must also awaken the Dark Heart."
"115740052-0-38438";"You're sure the keystone will power it, Belain? It must be ready when the time comes."
"115740052-0-38439";"The Orrery of Arkthzand. The key to our salvation. It has stood here, unmoving, for nearly three thousand years."
"115740052-0-38440";"I gave you my word, Belain. The Gray Host will make your prophecy come true."
"115740052-0-38441";"Watch for signs of the Gray Host. That should point us toward Rada and Belain."
"115740052-0-38442";"So Lady Belain did belong to the Nighthollow clan. Interesting …."
"115740052-0-38443";"I made some interesting discoveries while I was waiting."
"115740052-0-38444";"Oh, I'll just await your return then."
"115740052-0-38454";"Reach witch signs and portents can be tiresome, but they are necessary for this. The Dark Heart must beat again!"
"115740052-0-38455";"Do you hear? The sound is faint, but constant! The Dark Heart stirs!"
"115740052-0-38456";"I hate to admit it, but this place is impressive."
"115740052-0-38457";"Over here, partner."
"115740052-0-38459";"They chipped a hunk off this stone. If Rada al-Saran went through the trouble, we might as well, too."
"115740052-0-38468";"Lord Verandis, I apologize for the delay. The study is ready for you."
"115740052-0-38469";"Easy, friend. It's time to wake up. Find the dream-walk potion and drink it."
"115740052-0-38470";"After all this time, his scent lingers in this place."
"115740052-0-38471";"Did you find the journal? What's it say?"
"115740052-0-38472";"Get the reliquary and meet me in the ritual chamber."
"115740052-0-38473";"No! Death cannot claim the Nighthollow!"
"115740052-0-38474";"Ah, this looks promising. A noble's chamber, I think. Take a look around."
"115740052-0-38475";"Have you found something I can cast my auramancy upon?"
"115740052-0-38476";"The damn Dwarves! If they depleted its energy …."
"115740052-0-38477";"But the Heart falters. Something is wrong."
"115740052-0-38478";"We broke through. The way to the Dark Heart is open."
"115740052-0-38479";"Father, it wasn't just your research that let him revive the Gray Host. The actual procedure was your creation!"
"115740052-0-38480";"Seal the Dark Halls. Until the Heart recovers, only those who bear the sign of the inner circle may partake of its gifts."
"115740052-0-38481";"We won't find Rada's laboratory that way."
"115740052-0-38482";"The entrance to Rada's laboratory must be hidden."
"115740052-0-38483";"Did you find something? Let me see."
"115740052-0-38486";"I think this is the entrance to the Dark Halls."
"115740052-0-38489";"Verandis! Is that really you?"
"115740052-0-38491";"Don't move, exarch! We've got questions!"
"115740052-0-38493";"Stop! It's me, Gwendis!"
"115740052-0-38494";"Fine! You want to fight? Let's do this!"
"115740052-0-38495";"Must … feed!"
"115740052-0-38496";"So … hungry!"
"115740052-0-38501";"That's a stone husk, all right. Light the candles to begin the ritual."
"115740052-0-38502";"The ritual, it's working!"
"115740052-0-38503";"We just want to talk!"
"115740052-0-38504";"Verandis! No!"
"115740052-0-38506";"Verandis! What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-38507";"Who do you think sealed this place, child? I came as soon as my wards were disturbed."
"115740052-0-38508";"Verandis, you should have told me about the Gray Council!"
"115740052-0-38509";"So you know, Gwendis? Come, let us all speak outside."
"115740052-0-38510";"Oh, Verandis, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-38511";"My apologies. The process … doesn't leave one in their right mind."
"115740052-0-38512";"I'm just glad you're alive! But Verandis, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-38513";"Of course, my child. Let us all go outside and speak."
"115740052-0-38514";"As you can see, powerful magic wards the door. Perhaps I can draw a memory from it."
"115740052-0-38518";"Belain, we're dying. There's nothing you can do."
"115740052-0-38519";"I refuse to accept that, Idrisin. But one of us must remain strong to save the others."
"115740052-0-38520";"I will take the remaining energy from the Dark Heart. It will sustain me until I determine how to make it beat again."
"115740052-0-38521";"No, Belain. You know blood no longer sustains us. If you take the last of the Heart's energy, the rest of us will starve …."
"115740052-0-38522";"This explains something of Lady Belain's motives."
"115740052-0-38529";"Bradan! What news of the Ghostsong clan?"
"115740052-0-38530";"Your sister led the clan to Lost Valley. I was about to join them. Who's the outsider?"
"115740052-0-38531";"Why Lost Valley, Nathari? What are you planning, my sister?"
"115740052-0-38532";"Those souls … the people of Markarth! Rada … what have you done?"
"115740052-0-38533";"Now, to begin. Start by adding aetheric power."
"115740052-0-38535";"Now, quickly—I need more kinetic power!"
"115740052-0-38536";"Now, some tonal energy!"
"115740052-0-38537";"Quickly—help Fennorian!"
"115740052-0-38538";"We're losing kinetic energy—I need more!"
"115740052-0-38539";"I need an influx of aetheric power!"
"115740052-0-38540";"Gwendis needs your help with the Nighthollow rite!"
"115740052-0-38541";"Adjust the tonal frequency, quickly!"
"115740052-0-38542";"We almost have it! Just a little more."
"115740052-0-38544";"I'm losing control of it! Reduce the kinetic energy!"
"115740052-0-38545";"The Nighthollow rite is surging! Help Gwendis!"
"115740052-0-38546";"The tonal harmonics are in discord! Change the output!"
"115740052-0-38547";"To Fennorian! We'll need the alchemical reaction soon!"
"115740052-0-38548";"Recalibrate the aetheric power! It's too little!"
"115740052-0-38549";"The kinetic mechanism is off-balance! Set it right!"
"115740052-0-38550";"We're close! Help Gwendis with the Nighthollow rite once more!"
"115740052-0-38551";"Catalyze the Reach alchemy! Now!"
"115740052-0-38552";"Initiate a tonal cascade! And hang on!"
"115740052-0-38553";"I can see it! I can see everything!"
"115740052-0-38554";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-38556";"No, no, no, no. No! You're damaging it! That's not how this should work!"
"115740052-0-38557";"Gods, I can't get the smell of her blood off my hands."
"115740052-0-38558";"It was a mercy, you know that."
"115740052-0-38559";"I ruined her, Rada! Body and soul! I played god and Lisolda paid the price. I'm a damned fool."
"115740052-0-38560";"A fool once told me there is no such thing as damnation, only souls who have lost hope."
"115740052-0-38561";"That's not fair, Rada."
"115740052-0-38562";"You said it with such conviction, I could not argue. You have not forgotten our promise, I hope."
"115740052-0-38563";"We'll seek salvation together. Thank you, Rada."
"115740052-0-38564";"This is feasible?"
"115740052-0-38565";"No, Rada, merely a possibility. But the soul binding required—"
"115740052-0-38566";"We can save our kindred from Coldharbour's torment and you quibble over the cost? Is your heart so cold?"
"115740052-0-38567";"Even if you returned our kindred to life, Molag Bal's claim to their souls would remain. Our contracts are inviolable."
"115740052-0-38568";"Another obstacle to overcome—"
"115740052-0-38569";"You think the Prince of Domination is merely an obstacle? Rada, listen to yourself!"
"115740052-0-38570";"Kneeling when I should have stood proud was the greatest mistake I ever made. I will not repeat it."
"115740052-0-38571";"Rada?"
"115740052-0-38572";"Are those my notes?"
"115740052-0-38573";"Hmm? Verandis! Forgive me. As ever, your genius captivates me. I had no idea you made such progress."
"115740052-0-38574";"I'm still no closer to a viable solution."
"115740052-0-38575";"You're closer than you think."
"115740052-0-38576";"How can you know that?"
"115740052-0-38577";"I discussed your findings with a new ally. They claim it will work. Only your trepidation holds us back."
"115740052-0-38578";"I … I thought you'd changed, that you sought penance. I won't participate in mass murder!"
"115740052-0-38579";"Our dream is within reach and you're still concerned for the mortals? Verandis!"
"115740052-0-38582";"This looks like some kind of manufacturing equipment."
"115740052-0-38583";"As far as libraries go, the lighting in here is terrible. Hey, I bet that's what we came for!"
"115740052-0-38584";"Enough! Let's see how you like my wolfsbane formula!"
"115740052-0-38585";"Come on, <<1>>. Let's get you back to <<2>>."
"115740052-0-38586";"Fulfilling an oath and saving my brethren … our brethren. This is the way it must be, Verandis. You'll understand. In time."
"115740052-0-38587";"Rada, no! You must not awaken the Dark Heart!"
"115740052-0-38595";"The door's definitely warded. Those crystals must be the key to opening it."
"115740052-0-38596";"The way looks clear. Let's see if we can get inside!"
"115740052-0-38597";"Exarch Verandis. While we have your crates moved to your study, Exarchs Tzinghalis and Ulfra would like a word."
"115740052-0-38598";"Verandis, my friend. At long last."
"115740052-0-38599";"This one hates criminals. Especially vampire criminals."
"115740052-0-38600";"This way, five-claw! Follow me!"
"115740052-0-38601";"Look at the dome! Markarth's souls are being drawn inside!"
"115740052-0-38602";"The shard amplifies the energy. Rotate it and focus the energy on another crystal."
"115740052-0-38603";"Something is happening! Try activating the remaining two platforms."
"115740052-0-38604";"That did something! Try to connect the crystals at all four corners of the room."
"115740052-0-38605";"Careful! That Nighthollow vampire radiates with the power of the Dark Heart!"
"115740052-0-38606";"Hold, five-claw. Adusa has a plan."
"115740052-0-38607";"Remember, five-claw. Watch. Then come to my rescue if things go badly."
"115740052-0-38608";"The Reach ritual—it's catalyzing too quickly!"
"115740052-0-38609";"Ah, Adusa-daro of the Ravenwatch. Kathad told me to expect you."
"115740052-0-38610";"Let me talk to Kathad, Trenlor."
"115740052-0-38611";"Kathad returned for his love, so I sent him to her. I banished them to the Deep Tombs."
"115740052-0-38612";"His love … you mean Freyleth? She's here, too?"
"115740052-0-38613";"Freyleth bit above her station. As for Kathad, you can join him. Toss her in the Deep Tombs!"
"115740052-0-38614";"Try not to die too quickly, Ravenwatch cur!"
"115740052-0-38617";"Well that escalated quickly. Don't worry, I found just the thing to help pry him out of that oversized alembic."
"115740052-0-38618";"That worked better than this one expected, yes?"
"115740052-0-38619";"There you are! Damn shades are everywhere. Where's Verandis?"
"115740052-0-38620";"Come on. Up that rise. We'll find him."
"115740052-0-38621";"Get back, you bastards!"
"115740052-0-38622";"Gods … in the sky. That must be the Darkstorm."
"115740052-0-38623";"It must lead to Rada al-Saran. Let's follow the storm. Hopefully, Verandis will do the same."
"115740052-0-38624";"You hear that? Voices in the storm!"
"115740052-0-38625";"Rada, stop! I don't want to fight you."
"115740052-0-38626";"Look at you, Verandis. The Dark Heart is overwhelming you."
"115740052-0-38627";"I won't do as you—argh!"
"115740052-0-38628";"Will you really embrace death and damnation just to spite me, old friend?"
"115740052-0-38629";"Rada …."
"115740052-0-38630";"I forgive you, Verandis. You didn't turn your back on our dream. You lost hope. That is my gift to you."
"115740052-0-38631";"I can save you. I can save all of us. Salvation is within our grasp. All you need do is take hold."
"115740052-0-38632";"You really think we'll have peace here?"
"115740052-0-38633";"Goodbye, Rada. I wish I could have found salvation for us both."
"115740052-0-38634";"Ah! The Darkstorm rages! I must take control!"
"115740052-0-38635";"It will kill you!"
"115740052-0-38637";"If I don't stop the Darkstorm, then my death will be the least of our worries!"
"115740052-0-38638";"Gods—this power. It's everything Rada said it would be."
"115740052-0-38639";"Harrier, over here! The Gray Host assault has begun!"
"115740052-0-38640";"I don't understand. It's like the Gray Host is guarding this place."
"115740052-0-38641";"It doesn't look like the Gray Host attacked my clan. At least not yet. We need to find them!"
"115740052-0-38642";"You're back! But—where's Verandis?"
"115740052-0-38643";"He's … staying behind. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-38645";"I was hoping to catch up to—"
"115740052-0-38646";"You hear that? Markarth is celebrating."
"115740052-0-38650";"Oh, I'm going to enjoy this, you bastard."
"115740052-0-38652";"I expect you back before Fennorian gets bored. Don't make me come in there after you."
"115740052-0-38653";"We shall endeavor to return shortly. Farewell, my friends."
"115740052-0-38654";"I … I see. I can't end the Darkstorm. Not yet."
"115740052-0-38655";"This is farewell."
"115740052-0-38656";"I don't want to owe you, Verandis."
"115740052-0-38657";"Have faith. Rada's last gift was hope."
"115740052-0-38658";"She didn't have to die, Freyleth."
"115740052-0-38659";"See what you can find."
"115740052-0-38660";"Gray Host scratchings? What does it say?"
"115740052-0-38661";"<STINGER>"
"115740052-0-38663";"The entrance should be here somewhere. Look around."
"115740052-0-38664";"Look! Look! Can you believe it? There's life to the keep again!"
"115740052-0-38665";"That's your doing, isn't it? The ard seems to think so. He'll want to see you. He's holding an audience in his war room right now."
"115740052-0-38666";"What's this about a war room?"
"115740052-0-38667";"Oh, you're here, too she-wo—ah, Titanborn. You come with me. I have a message for your ears alone."
"115740052-0-38668";"Fine, but if this is Caddach's idea of a joke, you won't find it funny."
"115740052-0-38672";"Ah, you found the rock. That's actually the door. But it will only open for a Ghostsong witch."
"115740052-0-38673";"Well look at that. I've still got it. Now let's enter the barrow and find my sister."
"115740052-0-38675";"We're here. Let's speak for a moment."
"115740052-0-38676";"Come back when you have more time. I'll be here."
"115740052-0-38677";"I am as frustrated as you are, Gwendis. We don't have a keystone, and I haven't been able to discern another way to get inside."
"115740052-0-38678";"This won't save your brothers and sisters. I told you it's impossible!"
"115740052-0-38679";"There is no stopping it now, Verandis. A few more adjustments to this infernal machine and all will be ready."
"115740052-0-38680";"I won't harm your old friend, Rada. But this other one has meddled in my affairs for the last time!"
"115740052-0-38682";"The Spirit Queen led me here, harrier! I'll help you defeat this abomination!"
"115740052-0-38683";"No … this isn't possible! The Dark Heart … sustains me …."
"115740052-0-38684";"Slave! Bring me my chalice! I thirst!"
"115740052-0-38685";"Bah! Stupid slave! You gave me spoiled blood!"
"115740052-0-38686";"Ritual sacrifices. Nathari wants the clan to return to the old ways."
"115740052-0-38687";"It's not spoiled, you bastard. That's darkcap!"
"115740052-0-38688";"Murder, Freyleth? Where is your honor?"
"115740052-0-38689";"Let's go, Kathad. Freyleth has chosen her path. It's time you took another."
"115740052-0-38690";"That's her way, Kathad. Five-claw, a word."
"115740052-0-38691";"Freyleth lied to us, but the clan is better off in her hands than Boss Trenlor's. I'm ready to join the Ravenwatch now."
"115740052-0-38692";"We are agreed. If Eastern and Western Skyrim can put aside their differences in the face of the Gray Host, then the Reach can do so as well."
"115740052-0-38693";"Come forward, freehand. No need to bow for the sake of kings."
"115740052-0-38694";"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, my friend. Do forgive my ghastly appearance."
"115740052-0-38695";"Freehands of Markarth! You long suffering lot I call my kin! We've survived another long night. Darker than we've ever known."
"115740052-0-38696";"But we didn't endure it alone. Against the Gray Host we found unlikely allies and put aside old grudges. Together we not only survived, we flourished."
"115740052-0-38697";"We owe these miracles to the efforts of all kinds: Reachman, Nord, vampire, outlander. Heroes of every stripe."
"115740052-0-38698";"Oh, but you're wrong. About so many things. Can't you feel it, Verandis? The tug of the Dark Heart on your cursed soul."
"115740052-0-38700";"The glory of the Nighthollow clan returns. Let your life feed our darkness!"
"115740052-0-38701";"You cannot still the Dark Heart now!"
"115740052-0-38702";"The Dark Heart …. You're going to sever our souls from Bal?"
"115740052-0-38703";"Attention!"
"115740052-0-38704";"Draw steel!"
"115740052-0-38705";"Engage flank!"
"115740052-0-38706";"Engage front!"
"115740052-0-38707";"Engage! All sides!"
"115740052-0-38708";"Engage low!"
"115740052-0-38709";"Sheathe steel!"
"115740052-0-38710";"I am here, I will lend you what aid I can to rid the reach of this abomination"
"115740052-0-38711";"The portal, harrier … it will return you to … Verandis …."
"115740052-0-38712";"Nathari, no! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-38713";"The hour is upon us, dear sister! You must feel it. The darkness!"
"115740052-0-38714";"You sacrificed our own people! Oh, poor Saagan!"
"115740052-0-38718";"The clan chose me, Arana! The Spirit Queen demands death and I shall give it to her!"
"115740052-0-38719";"Damn it. I should never have left."
"115740052-0-38720";"No. I can't allow this. We need to find Bradan and the others."
"115740052-0-38722";"Ghostsong hunters loyal to Nathari? Surely some must have opposed her."
"115740052-0-38723";"More dead. It seems when they did fight back, they were quickly overwhelmed."
"115740052-0-38724";"This is madness! Nathari will bring ruin upon the entire clan!"
"115740052-0-38725";"Oh, poor Senan. Not you too, old friend? What's that beside him?"
"115740052-0-38726";"Here, my friend. Was your hunt successful?"
"115740052-0-38727";"What do those scratch marks tell you?"
"115740052-0-38729";"I thought you might enjoy a welcome surprise for once, Snow Lily."
"115740052-0-38731";"I'm off to Lost Valley. If you want to find your sister, that's where she'll be."
"115740052-0-38732";"This Gray Host scout has been clawed to pieces. Bradan's work, I presume. But why are these monsters here in the first place?"
"115740052-0-38734";"The Dark Heart stirs! You can't stop the prophecy from being fulfilled!"
"115740052-0-38738";"Nathari's power is growing. Every sacrifice strengthens the darkness."
"115740052-0-38739";"The darkness, it responds! The Dark Heart awakens!"
"115740052-0-38740";"Give your lives so the Dark Heart may beat again!"
"115740052-0-38741";"Stop Nathari before she feeds my entire clan to the darkness!"
"115740052-0-38742";"These'll put hair on your chest. Down one and try tearing off some of those pressure valves!"
"115740052-0-38743";"There's more where those came from. Here! Drink up!"
"115740052-0-38744";"We did it, harrier! The Dark Heart returns to its slumber!"
"115740052-0-38746";"Bradan! You're alive. Thank the spirits!"
"115740052-0-38747";"This one, Tayfaern? Come, harrier. Give me your measure."
"115740052-0-38748";"Go to Valthume Barrow at once. This might finally give us an edge against the Gray Host."
"115740052-0-38749";"Stay behind me, beloved! Oh, Adusa? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-38750";"We came to save you, Kathad. Talk to him, five-claw. I'll watch the door."
"115740052-0-38751";"We couldn't have her raise the alarm, Kathad. This only works if Trenlor suspects nothing."
"115740052-0-38752";"Now, Gwendis, you know I never ask anything without good reason. Markarth is in danger."
"115740052-0-38753";"A soul's ability to travel among the infinite planes of existence is equally boundless."
"115740052-0-38754";"Souls can go anywhere! Imagine if they had the freedom to choose their destination, or even return to life."
"115740052-0-38755";"Is that Count Verandis?"
"115740052-0-38756";"It's the auramancy. We're seeing an image of the past."
"115740052-0-38757";"Fine! But when the real action starts, I won't sit on the side and let you deal with all the danger."
"115740052-0-38758";"Do not be concerned, Rada al-Saran. Your plan proceeds. Caddach hangs on my every word and soon Reachfolk will fill Markarth like a larder."
"115740052-0-38759";"Excellent. With Markarth prepared, we need only claim the Arkthzand Keystone."
"115740052-0-38760";"I'll make inquiries. Just remember our arrangement. Like you, I hate to be disappointed."
"115740052-0-38761";"You there, in the shadows. You can't hide from the Ashen Lord. Follow me if you dare."
"115740052-0-38762";"We think the Dwarves placed these plaques, but no one really knows. See what that one says."
"115740052-0-38763";"That depicts the sky tale of the Headsman. I think your people call it the Warrior."
"115740052-0-38764";"These plaques are as old as these hills, harrier. Take a look."
"115740052-0-38765";"That's the Witch in the Stars. Or the Mage, as you call it."
"115740052-0-38766";"Look, harrier, a plaque. Let's examine it."
"115740052-0-38767";"That's a sky tale. We call it the Hunter, but I think you would refer to it as the Thief."
"115740052-0-38768";"Aye, this must be the spot. Just look at all this Dwarfcraft."
"115740052-0-38769";"The entrance to Bthar-Zel must be around here somewhere. Always a trick with Dwarves, though."
"115740052-0-38772";"That door is clearly blocked. And that strange energy …? Wait. Is there something on the floor?"
"115740052-0-38773";"That's a strange-looking shard …."
"115740052-0-38774";"Such destruction! And not the slow decay of time. Something terrible happened here."
"115740052-0-38776";"Fenn, what did you do?"
"115740052-0-38777";"See if you can find the signet. It must be in one of these crates or boxes."
"115740052-0-38778";"What is this place? Did Verandis use this as a secret study? Check the desk, would you?"
"115740052-0-38779";"It worked! Well done, my friend."
"115740052-0-38783";"You actually followed? There's fire in your veins, I'll give you that. Very well. You may speak to me."
"115740052-0-38785";"It worked! I mean, of course it worked. I'll be waiting on the other side."
"115740052-0-38786";"I had every confidence you wouldn't get sucked into some boundless void. The repository is just through this door."
"115740052-0-38787";"I'm more of a spy than a fighter. I'll shadow you on the way in."
"115740052-0-38788";"Fair warning. I won't jeopardize my mission if you run into trouble, so try not to die. I'd feel guilty."
"115740052-0-38789";"Nice welcome. Told you I smelled werewolves and alchemy."
"115740052-0-38790";"Watch for ambushes. It will be hard to get through this canyon unnoticed."
"115740052-0-38794";"Welcome back, my friend. Tell me what you learned."
"115740052-0-38795";"Only one way to find out. Could come in handy, if you're feeling brave."
"115740052-0-38796";"Belain hasn't returned, but she could have other eyes here in court. Be wary."
"115740052-0-38797";"Now for this reliquary."
"115740052-0-38798";"Hah! These overgrown rocks won't do them much good without their source of power."
"115740052-0-38799";"This appears to be some sort of containment apparatus. And there's a shade trapped at the center."
"115740052-0-38800";"Look here. This resembles your keystone, doesn't it? The parts anyway. I wager this is what we came for."
"115740052-0-38801";"What's this? More of Rada al-Saran's auramancy, I suspect."
"115740052-0-38802";"Verandis was aware of this plan? And he was its architect?"
"115740052-0-38803";"Hmph, these coven designs prove as inferior as I predicted."
"115740052-0-38804";"You must be Arkasis."
"115740052-0-38805";"Aha. It's good to see my name is getting the recognition it deserves!"
"115740052-0-38806";"I'll give you the honor of basking in my brilliance, if you survive the demonstration. Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-38807";"I'm going after him. You keep moving!"
"115740052-0-38810";"Verandis keeps everyone at arm's length. Is this why?"
"115740052-0-38811";"Uninvited guests! In my home! Please forgive my hospitality. I have not entertained in centuries."
"115740052-0-38812";"Assistants! Swat this fly! She's interfering with my work!"
"115740052-0-38813";"Hey, there's another memento here. Like the one Fennorian found near Bthardamz."
"115740052-0-38814";"Well done, Talfyg. You brought me a daughter of Verandis, as requested. She will complement our lord's army well."
"115740052-0-38815";"I have to rethink. A new approach. Unassailable! No more tests! Get out! I need focus!"
"115740052-0-38816";"Such power! Perhaps I should not let my pets tear you limb from limb. Vaduroth can take your soul, instead."
"115740052-0-38817";"We've got to keep him out of that chamber. I'll see if I can sabotage some equipment."
"115740052-0-38818";"Keep it up! I think I've almost got it!"
"115740052-0-38819";"That should do it! Let's smoke him out of there!"
"115740052-0-38820";"No! It's overloading. Let me out! Ahh!"
"115740052-0-38821";"Aha! I've gone beyond mere flesh and blood! I am transcendent! Ahahaha!"
"115740052-0-38822";"Verandis? So it's true, you are alive. Nevertheless, the keystone is mine."
"115740052-0-38823";"I told you I saw him, skulking around Markarth. He's not as impressive as you led me to believe."
"115740052-0-38828";"Verandis and Rada al-Saran seemed pretty friendly back in the day. Did you know about that?"
"115740052-0-38830";"Oh, who's a good girl then, eh? You're a good girl! Now take your medicine, Chitter."
"115740052-0-38831";"The past is ancient history. Rada's intentions were to sway me back to his side."
"115740052-0-38832";"That's not good enough, count. Why didn't you tell us that this was all your fault?"
"115740052-0-38834";"An ally against the Gray Host. I'll let them tell you themself."
"115740052-0-38835";"I'll remain by your side as we search."
"115740052-0-38836";"A moment. I sense …. Rada has been this way."
"115740052-0-38837";"Rada's laboratory. I see he's adopted Tzinghalis's methods."
"115740052-0-38838";"Yes, this is it. I can feel the echoes of Rada's work here."
"115740052-0-38839";"This isn't your fault, Arana. Nathari could only see her own visions. Hear her own spirits."
"115740052-0-38840";"Hey! Stop that! How dare you! I will not be thwarted by my own creations!"
"115740052-0-38842";"Rada al-Saran was the survivor! That figures. And Lady Thorn helped him. Or should I say Lady Ingerien?"
"115740052-0-38843";"Failure is not an option. Let's start by adding aetheric power."
"115740052-0-38846";"To the orrery! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-38847";"All right, that should draw the patrols. Now show me this secret door."
"115740052-0-38848";"This is the chance you never thought possible."
"115740052-0-38850";"Arrgh! Rada, don't do this!"
"115740052-0-38851";"The Void energy is consuming you, Verandis. I can show you how to control it. Just follow me."
"115740052-0-38852";"The door to our salvation stands open, Verandis. Come. Finish what we started. All will be forgiven."
"115740052-0-38853";"What happened? Where'd the bastard go this time?"
"115740052-0-38854";"He's gone, Lyris. To the one place where he can complete his plan."
"115740052-0-38855";"I need to speak with you about what I found in those documents."
"115740052-0-38856";"Music"
"115740052-0-38857";"Music"
"115740052-0-38858";"We are free, my brothers and sisters! Let us drink to the Lothid clan and its new leader—me!"
"115740052-0-38859";"I wanted to save the clan, but not like this."
"115740052-0-38860";"Leaving me, Kathad? Fine. Go join your precious cat and pretend not to be the monster you are."
"115740052-0-38861";"Music"
"115740052-0-38862";"Music"
"115740052-0-38863";"Music"
"115740052-0-38864";"Music"
"115740052-0-38865";"Music"
"115740052-0-38866";"Music"
"115740052-0-38867";"Music"
"115740052-0-38868";"Music"
"115740052-0-38870";"Yes, this way. And step quietly. The stones have ears."
"115740052-0-38871";"Be off, reeker. Ard Caddach refuses to see you. Now go before I gut you."
"115740052-0-38872";"The ard needs to hear what I have to say, my friend. It is imperative that we speak."
"115740052-0-38873";"A dormant Dark Heart is of little use to us, Belain."
"115740052-0-38874";"It can be awakened, but I need to get the help of the Reach witches."
"115740052-0-38875";"Patience, Belain. Not until I restore the Gray Host. Not until we unlock the orrery."
"115740052-0-38876";"More delays! Very well. But the Dark Heart must beat again, Rada al-Saran. Nothing else matters."
"115740052-0-38877";"Good. Now place the reliquary."
"115740052-0-38878";"Talk to Kathad, five-claw. Tell him what you found."
"115740052-0-38880";"Stars and spheres, of course. An orrery!"
"115740052-0-38881";"You look perfect! Now sneak into Boss Trenlor's court and place the mushroom."
"115740052-0-38882";"Brothers and sisters, we are on the cusp of victory."
"115740052-0-38883";"When the Darkstorm blows through the Void, everything we lost will be returned. Even your lives."
"115740052-0-38884";"Go without fear. Claim victory. Success will bring salvation—"
"115740052-0-38885";"Verandis's little birds. Give him my best."
"115740052-0-38886";"It seems Rada came here a long time ago. This is the most recent memory, but it's still centuries old."
"115740052-0-38887";"Hmm. This place is full of mushrooms! Look sharp, five-claw."
"115740052-0-38889";"That's a Gray Host command camp up ahead. Let's see what they're doing here."
"115740052-0-38890";"That must be the lift, five-claw. Let's go."
"115740052-0-38891";"That's a Gray Host pentarch. Probably after the same thing as us. What's that beside him?"
"115740052-0-38894";"Pity. I wanted Verandis to see this place for himself."
"115740052-0-38895";"And these must be the stolen remains Fennorian was telling me about. Never seen this symbol on these urns."
"115740052-0-38896";"Whoa, these constructs are huge!"
"115740052-0-38897";"Can you feel the power in this urn? I think it's charging these statues."
"115740052-0-38898";"That should keep these ones nice and still."
"115740052-0-38899";"Hey! Over here!"
"115740052-0-38900";"So, any other thousand-year-old secrets I should know about?"
"115740052-0-38901";"Do you really want to hear all the sordid details of my past, Gwendis?"
"115740052-0-38902";"I never thought I'd see you again. So much has happened."
"115740052-0-38903";"I know, Gwendis. We have much to discuss. Come, let us return to Ravenwatch Castle."
"115740052-0-38904";"We're almost to the summit. The barrow entrance is just ahead."
"115740052-0-38905";"The absolute gall! Little people, coming into my home and destroying my creations! You will pay!"
"115740052-0-38906";"Dark magic, rising all around us. Nathari must have started the ritual!"
"115740052-0-38907";"The spirits watch over Karthwasten once again. We are in your debt."
"115740052-0-38910";"Isn't it obvious? Nocturnal has abandoned us!"
"115740052-0-38911";"That's ridiculous, Eamon! We're going to restore the wards."
"115740052-0-38912";"You put too much trust in this outsider, Fialyn."
"115740052-0-38913";"The spirits sent them to help us."
"115740052-0-38914";"First a storm, now an outsider. What plague will the spirits send next?"
"115740052-0-38917";"Watch, Verandis, as I destroy everything you cherish!"
"115740052-0-38918";"We are the land and the land is us. Spirits, accept our offering and restore our wards!"
"115740052-0-38919";"Karthwasten belongs to the Reach!"
"115740052-0-38922";"Something has gone wrong! Outsider, come speak to me!"
"115740052-0-38924";"Fialyn, you refused my counsel at great risk to us all."
"115740052-0-38925";"No! I oversaw the placing of the offerings myself! It should have worked!"
"115740052-0-38927";"Of course it failed! You involved an outsider!"
"115740052-0-38929";"Something must be interfering with the ritual!"
"115740052-0-38932";"I'll go to the mine with the outsider."
"115740052-0-38933";"No, Eamon. I'm the shaman's eyes. I need to do this."
"115740052-0-38939";"Meet me at the mine, outsider. We need to find the source of this corruption."
"115740052-0-38940";"The corruption is gone and Karthwasten endures."
"115740052-0-38941";"We ask the spirits to once more bless and defend our home."
"115740052-0-38945";"I feel power returning to the wards. The spirits stand with us once more!"
"115740052-0-38946";"Aye, Eamon. I did. You were wrong. This is our home. We couldn't abandon it."
"115740052-0-38947";"I … Fialyn, I'm sorry. You and the outsider made things right."
"115740052-0-38953";"That all you've got, leech?"
"115740052-0-38958";"Do you feel it? The pull of dark magic from below? We need to hurry!"
"115740052-0-38959";"There's powerful magic beyond this door. Be careful."
"115740052-0-38960";"I thirst!"
"115740052-0-38961";"I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-38962";"No! Not again!"
"115740052-0-38963";"No!"
"115740052-0-38964";"He's staying …? No. He promised—he promised me!"
"115740052-0-38965";"It was the only way to—"
"115740052-0-38966";"Arana?"
"115740052-0-38967";"I—I can breathe … I'm alive?"
"115740052-0-38970";"The spirits abandoned us, Fialyn! We need to leave this place!"
"115740052-0-38972";"Harrier? Over here!"
"115740052-0-38973";"I knew I sensed … a friendly presence. Thank the spirits … for leading you here."
"115740052-0-38974";"Below us! The darkness gathers in that infernal pit."
"115740052-0-38975";"I can feel it. The Dark Heart. It's waking up!"
"115740052-0-38976";"Hold there, outsider!"
"115740052-0-38977";"The darkness, it makes Nathari stronger. I'll try to contain it!"
"115740052-0-38978";"Down the stairs, then look for the vaults. That's where … I fought Lady Belain."
"115740052-0-38980";"Oh, Sai. You always know how to—oh. Uh, hello, partner."
"115740052-0-38981";"We're going the right way. The entrance is farther up. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-38982";"Finally, the guest of honor has arrived! Let's have a word before we begin."
"115740052-0-38984";"Let us follow their example. We have warred together, we celebrate together, let us rebuild together!"
"115740052-0-38985";"From this day forward we clash mugs instead of swords! Peace and prosperity to all our kingdoms! Cheers to the heroes of Skyrim!"
"115740052-0-38986";"Stay here as long as you like. I'm done waiting for Ard Caddach to muster the clans."
"115740052-0-38987";"Are you, now? And what do you plan to do about it? Join those rebels? You wouldn't have the first clue about how to find them!"
"115740052-0-38989";"Nathari's madness was her own, Arana. We'll follow you."
"115740052-0-38990";"Heed our call, Hunt-King! Two great packs seek the same full moon. Make them one, bound by common prey."
"115740052-0-38991";"Let Reach and Raven drink of the same dark blood. Howl your blessing, mighty Hircine! Send a sign and guide our hunt!"
"115740052-0-38992";"That's all of the offerings. Now we need to place them at the wards."
"115740052-0-38993";"The offerings have been placed. Let's return to Shaman Ulvoch."
"115740052-0-38994";"Easy, friend! I'm not your enemy!"
"115740052-0-38995";"You see? Once I gather the exarchs to my side, my ancient promise will be fulfilled."
"115740052-0-38996";"Take that, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-38997";"Oh ho! An outsider! Haven't seen one of you in an eternity."
"115740052-0-38998";"Rada …."
"115740052-0-38999";"Come have a chat if you want some advice. It may just keep you alive."
"115740052-0-39000";"I step away to deal with a stray werewolf and someone steals my prize? So, what did you find in the coffer?"
"115740052-0-39001";"I think I understand, Sai. You need to put aside your duty, just this once, and focus on what you want."
"115740052-0-39002";"Borfree? Is that you? Whoever you are, come help me this instant!"
"115740052-0-39003";"Well that fight looked a bit thorny! Ha, get it? I said …."
"115740052-0-39004";"You may have found us, but you won't live to tell the tale!"
"115740052-0-39005";"Hold on to that crossbow you found. You'll need it to keep going."
"115740052-0-39006";"Gwendis, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-39008";"Hircine's champion goes down! Ah, I'll miss that guy."
"115740052-0-39009";"Go through the portal to see what comes next."
"115740052-0-39015";"Mehrunes Dagon embodies ambition and destruction. Can't say I appreciate the destruction part but ambition, that's something with some real use."
"115740052-0-39016";"Speaking of ambition, time to get moving to the rest of the Rites."
"115740052-0-39018";"And with him down, you complete the Brimstone Den!"
"115740052-0-39019";"You can return to the Choosing through here."
"115740052-0-39020";"Shades. I sense their presence in every dark corner. Keep going."
"115740052-0-39021";"The path ends here, but there's a door up above. We need to find a way to reach it."
"115740052-0-39022";"So far, so good outsider. Halfway done with the Wounding."
"115740052-0-39023";"That portal should let you continue on the path."
"115740052-0-39025";"Phew! That last one was a big guy!"
"115740052-0-39026";"Strong work, outsider. Head back to the Choosing when you feel ready."
"115740052-0-39027";"Harrier …."
"115740052-0-39032";"Nocturnal, spirit of the night, accept this offering and send your crows to guard us."
"115740052-0-39033";"Hircine, spirit of the hunt, accept this offering and make our bounty plentiful."
"115740052-0-39034";"Namira, spirit of decay and ancient darkness, accept our humble offering and protect our mortal souls."
"115740052-0-39035";"Molag Bal, spirit of torment and trouble, accept this and teach us to endure the struggle."
"115740052-0-39036";"Please, help Verandis … I see it now … the Lord of the Gray Host threatens all Nirn."
"115740052-0-39037";"Let's see what we can find."
"115740052-0-39038";"We did it, my friends. Now tell me, what of Lady Belain?"
"115740052-0-39039";"I shall return to Markarth shortly."
"115740052-0-39040";"Well done, outsider. You perform beyond our expectations."
"115740052-0-39041";"Proceed through the portal below for your final challenge."
"115740052-0-39042";"How can you rest with death on our trail? We must keep moving!"
"115740052-0-39044";"You made it all the way to the end! Only one final challenge left. Me!"
"115740052-0-39045";"Heh. The world never feels so bleak that people pass up hearing a tale of tragedy. Ahem."
"115740052-0-39046";"The wind in the breast of Chieftain Fiasof was the hunting-horn's call. His pealing tenor was the baying pack of scenting-hounds."
"115740052-0-39047";"Hircine, the lord of hunts, watched Fiasof. He did with joy, at first, then anger. There was no struggle in Fiasof's chase, too skilled was he for prey."
"115740052-0-39048";"Oh? Ah! What … foul magic? I feel it … tearing me apart!"
"115740052-0-39049";"Hircine bade Fiasof slay a herd of deer, white as snow in hide.They were no challenge to the arrow-rain, and soon had red coats."
"115740052-0-39050";"Fiasof broke his bow over knee. He bowed to Hircine, asking for the great spirit's forgiveness."
"115740052-0-39051";"Battle, eh? You seem to be no stranger to violence. But if you wish it … ahem."
"115740052-0-39052";"Faolan, the Red Eagle, last drew his blade at sunset. Naked was his breast and arm and head. The light of his eyes dimmed, the hagraven's due."
"115740052-0-39053";"No ring or steel could turn his blade. Men were hewn through as reeds in wind. Red Eagle's flesh wept blood, blackened and thick with sorcery."
"115740052-0-39054";"The sun rose over the field of dead. Red Eagle stood, though no life was left to him."
"115740052-0-39055";"Oh, you have a scholarly bent? I wouldn't have guessed by the look of you. Ahem."
"115740052-0-39056";"Leovic, Moricar's son, ruled from sea to sea. Spirits made the man for Reach-hearths and tents."
"115740052-0-39057";"The city Anvil was fat and still, and could learn of Reachman's ways. Four times Leovic traveled there, arms bare and head crowned, to show the people their errors."
"115740052-0-39058";"Leovic would cast aside the wine-cup, upend the feast-table. He tore the silk and the damask he trampled in wrath."
"115740052-0-39059";"His answer was the bleating of sheep, the dismay at his destruction."
"115740052-0-39060";"A voidmother. We did not summon such a creature for this challenge."
"115740052-0-39061";"Vateshran's Rites now end. You did more than we expected. Well done."
"115740052-0-39062";"Melina Cassel … how do you always find yourself in a mess?"
"115740052-0-39063";"That's where you're wrong! Conul says they're gathering in the eastern foothills."
"115740052-0-39064";"Well, then, your head can wind up on a pike with the rest of them, you damn fool."
"115740052-0-39065";"Come on, Melina … you can do this …."
"115740052-0-39066";"Does he even know you exist, Melina …?"
"115740052-0-39067";"You've done it now, Melina …."
"115740052-0-39068";"Hello, my friend! Quite glad to see you again."
"115740052-0-39069";"Let us see … what do these entrails reveal of Namira's grand designs for you?"
"115740052-0-39070";"The intestines settle in the lee of the bowel … most auspicious indeed. Great Namira offers good tidings for your love."
"115740052-0-39071";"Bone shards lodged in the stomach lining … lady Namira sees a love in your future."
"115740052-0-39072";"My, my. The bile in the entrails has turned quite black with rot. A sickly creature … and a grim portent."
"115740052-0-39073";"Well, what is this? A stone ring in the gullet … a hunter's! So the beast bested one of the Reachfolk …."
"115740052-0-39074";"A punctured liver … the flesh has gone pallid. You face many battles, some with close compatriots."
"115740052-0-39075";"Scars across the hide and muscles—life was torment for this creature. Battle will be your undoing."
"115740052-0-39076";"What lurks inside this creature … oh! Fascinating. The hand of a thinblood, a merchant, perhaps, and a silver ring upon her finger."
"115740052-0-39077";"Inside the maw of the creature we find … the skull of a fawn, I believe. An easy meal, but one that claimed the life of this beast."
"115740052-0-39078";"What do we find in this creature's gullet? Hide, bone, a few scraps … it starved to death I see. Oh, an ill omen, wanderer."
"115740052-0-39079";"There you have it, stranger. The future that Namira intends for you. My reading is complete."
"115740052-0-39080";"Mighty Namira, what portents do you share …?"
"115740052-0-39081";"Did my foolish apprentice send you? How quaint."
"115740052-0-39082";"Ah, bliss is an open sky. Nothing better than the peace of solitude."
"115740052-0-39083";"The artifact is mine! You cannot fathom its power!"
"115740052-0-39084";"You will not stop me! The artifact will make me all-powerful!"
"115740052-0-39085";"A tunnel? The Nighthollow left the Dark Heart where they found it instead of bringing it to their keep? Strange."
"115740052-0-39086";"Hold! Someone left these belongings here. They may have a story to tell."
"115740052-0-39087";"A well-made weapon, placed with care. Let me try my auramancy."
"115740052-0-39089";"Can you feel the void energy? That's the Dark Heart!"
"115740052-0-39091";"The Dark Heart awakens! I can't stop it!"
"115740052-0-39092";"Lady Belain … I failed you …."
"115740052-0-39094";"I stopped heeding your advice a long, long time ago, Verandis."
"115740052-0-39096";"That lift over there, it should take us to the library grounds. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-39097";"Come, Eagleseers, Six-Fords! Have you no words to share?"
"115740052-0-39098";"An outsider has better sense than the lot of you! Come, outsider, help me prove a point."
"115740052-0-39099";"Let's see them try to get through that."
"115740052-0-39100";"If we take out those pillars, it should damage the mine enough to halt the Gray Host."
"115740052-0-39101";"It smells of blood and rot in here. Let's be ready for anything."
"115740052-0-39102";"What are these outsiders doing down here?"
"115740052-0-39103";"We have to stop dropping things, dolt!"
"115740052-0-39104";"Quiet, Eslyn! Someone's coming!"
"115740052-0-39106";"Thank you! I'm getting away from here!"
"115740052-0-39107";"You saved me. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-39108";"I won't forget this, stranger!"
"115740052-0-39109";"The feud is older than these crags. I doubt anyone knows its cause."
"115740052-0-39110";"A vateshran might know. They keep the history of the clans."
"115740052-0-39112";"Hmm. If we learned the reason for the feud, maybe we could end it. Then we wouldn't need the damned handfasting!"
"115740052-0-39113";"A vateshran named Barth visited the Six-Ford once. My father spoke highly of him."
"115740052-0-39114";"I know that name. He visited us, too! He has a camp in the hills southeast of here."
"115740052-0-39115";"This is his camp, but where's the vateshran?"
"115740052-0-39116";"I don't like the look of this."
"115740052-0-39117";"That's the vateshran's shillelagh! He wouldn't just leave it behind."
"115740052-0-39118";"That's a Thornroot clan's knife. Used for dark magic."
"115740052-0-39119";"No … Dark Heart, please! I … thirst …!"
"115740052-0-39120";"The Thornroot clan uses the ruins over the hill."
"115740052-0-39121";"Their witches must have taken the vateshran! We have to help him."
"115740052-0-39122";"Without weapons, we'll just get in the way. Our friend here will need to rescue the vateshran."
"115740052-0-39123";"Well, this seems like the place. Look at the size of it!"
"115740052-0-39124";"I can't … go on …. I need … the darkness …."
"115740052-0-39125";"Hey you! What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-39126";"An ominous turn. Come, my friend. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-39127";"So, this is Bthar-Zel, eh? Mind your feet, harrier. Every bit of metal in here means to do you harm."
"115740052-0-39128";"Never seen Dwarfcraft like this. Must have been chiefs who lived here. Chiefs or grand metalworkers."
"115740052-0-39129";"Namira's blood. They cut the heart out of the ground! It's an entire city under the earth … hiding something worse beneath."
"115740052-0-39130";"We're getting close to something, harrier. Something awful."
"115740052-0-39131";"The tales were true! Silver! I'll send crafters down to carve it out once we deal with the rest of these metal beasts."
"115740052-0-39132";"I hear something … wailing and scratching at the walls. There's darkness all around."
"115740052-0-39133";"Sentry Bodfe sent word. The Gray Host is—"
"115740052-0-39135";"That should be enough. Let's get back to my village."
"115740052-0-39136";"You there! Help me, please!"
"115740052-0-39137";"Ah, that's better. Now, could you help me get out of here?"
"115740052-0-39138";"Never thought I'd be so happy to see a gate in all my years."
"115740052-0-39139";"Now, let me thank you proper."
"115740052-0-39140";"The Dark Heart beats once more. Defy me, and die!"
"115740052-0-39141";"Hey you, Verandis has need of you!"
"115740052-0-39142";"Look at this place! A lot more run down than I imagined."
"115740052-0-39143";"Do you smell that? The stench of smoke."
"115740052-0-39144";"Something's on fire down below. Not a great sign."
"115740052-0-39149";"Lady Belain refuses to let us drink. Can't she see we're dying?"
"115740052-0-39150";"So much smoke! We have to hurry."
"115740052-0-39151";"The map says this hatch is the easiest way into the library. Come on!"
"115740052-0-39152";"The power! I waited centuries for the Dark Heart to beat once more!"
"115740052-0-39153";"They burned the entire library!"
"115740052-0-39154";"So many books. All those stories! Just … gone."
"115740052-0-39155";"We should split up to find the book before this whole place turns to ash."
"115740052-0-39156";"This is the sword that split Leki's blade reforged in bitter blood. You will taste it soon."
"115740052-0-39157";"Someone else wants the book! We cannot allow this."
"115740052-0-39158";"Hold them off while I keep looking!"
"115740052-0-39160";"There! That must be the Arkthzand Keystone!"
"115740052-0-39165";"Enough, Belain. Take the keystone. My Verandis would give chase. This pathetic creature? I don't know what it will decide to do."
"115740052-0-39166";"Rada, you must listen. There's still time to make things right. Rada. Rada!"
"115740052-0-39167";"Look at these pillars. More sky tales. Turn those stones in the right order and I think we'll find our door."
"115740052-0-39168";"That did something, harrier!"
"115740052-0-39169";"That looks right to me."
"115740052-0-39170";"You hear that? Well done!"
"115740052-0-39171";"That did it! Wait—arggh! Something's not right … a darkness …."
"115740052-0-39172";"Arana! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-39174";"This looks promising."
"115740052-0-39175";"Indeed. A Dwarven lock of some kind, I suspect."
"115740052-0-39176";"You don't understand. Please, tell me you found out more about the Darkstorm."
"115740052-0-39177";"Thank you, stranger. The Thornroots told us we'd be the next for the ritual."
"115740052-0-39178";"I'm getting out of here before it's too late. If you find Faorin, tell him he was a fool to parley with the Thornroots."
"115740052-0-39179";"Thank you! I saw the Hagravens take Chieftain Faorin up that tower. Please, help him!"
"115740052-0-39180";"You're lying! You stole the cowl from the chief-of-chiefs?"
"115740052-0-39181";"Bal take me if I speak untrue. She was stone-drunk! I plucked it—"
"115740052-0-39182";"A Six-Ford and an Eagleseer, yammering away like a couple of jackdaws. Now I've seen everything."
"115740052-0-39183";"Vateshran!"
"115740052-0-39184";"Calm yourself, lad. Your friend here told me what you and the lass are thinking."
"115740052-0-39185";"Espied the Lady Belain today? Or is she still burrowed deep in the Ard's ear?"
"115740052-0-39186";"I hear he has another if you're trying to make roost."
"115740052-0-39187";"Feh. Any one of us could rule Markarth! And without wrapping ourselves around Lady Belain's little finger."
"115740052-0-39188";"Enough of that talk. I'd like some peace before we all resume killing each other."
"115740052-0-39189";"The Ard had strange visitors today. Outsiders asking about Arana."
"115740052-0-39190";"The witch? Were they friend or foe?"
"115740052-0-39191";"My rooks couldn't tell. He met them in private. Without Lady Belain."
"115740052-0-39192";"Wonder if she's finally fallen out of favor with the Ard?"
"115740052-0-39193";"Arana's following grows by the day. And now they're mining silver! What's the witch up to?"
"115740052-0-39194";"So she plunders the land while we cower behind the Ard's walls?"
"115740052-0-39195";"No, not her way. Something to do with magic, more like."
"115740052-0-39196";"Aye, the moon-kissed ore has its uses against those marked by Hircine and Bal."
"115740052-0-39197";"Lady Belain returned today. Never seen her in such a mood."
"115740052-0-39198";"And what was the Ard's harpy complaining about today?"
"115740052-0-39199";"Wasn't anger. Excited—giddy, even. What do you suppose would make a woman like that giddy?"
"115740052-0-39200";"Bodes ill, for certain."
"115740052-0-39201";"You heard what's come of the witches of the Lost Valley?"
"115740052-0-39202";"No, but your tone says nothing good."
"115740052-0-39203";"They were sacrificing their own to gain power for the coven, or so say the survivors freed by Arana's rebels."
"115740052-0-39204";"Only those possessed by spirits of Sheogorath, would believe they could prosper from such a thing."
"115740052-0-39205";"I knew Lady Belain was plotting something! I only wish I could split her skull myself."
"115740052-0-39206";"Arana and her rebels saved us the trouble. If they hadn't shown up when they did …."
"115740052-0-39207";"I know. Who'd have thought we'd owe our lives to that lot?"
"115740052-0-39208";"Can't you just be grateful? I just hope the ard lets the rebels stay. They've earned their place."
"115740052-0-39209";"That story. I never heard it before. The elders never talk about it."
"115740052-0-39210";"What if we tell everyone the story? And we repair the Coil?"
"115740052-0-39211";"Vateshran, the fragments of the Coil. What became of them?"
"115740052-0-39212";"The tales say they were lost at the battles of Karthspire Lea and Faolan's Ire."
"115740052-0-39213";"I know Faolan's Ire. I'll look for a fragment there. Our friend can search Karthspire Lea."
"115740052-0-39214";"All right, Eslyn. I'll escort the vateshran back to Hroldan Ring."
"115740052-0-39215";"Their leader said he's after the book. We need to find it before he does."
"115740052-0-39216";"Eslyn? Where are you? Eslyn!"
"115740052-0-39217";"Outsider? If you're here then that means— ugh, Madearn, you fool."
"115740052-0-39218";"Outsider? Perfect timing, I could use your help."
"115740052-0-39219";"I found the fragment, but can't get to it. A giant made camp right on top of it."
"115740052-0-39221";"Eslyn!"
"115740052-0-39222";"Madearn? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-39223";"I had to make sure you were unharmed. I'm glad you're safe."
"115740052-0-39224";"I ran into a bit of trouble, but I'm better now."
"115740052-0-39227";"Hey! Up here! Look at this journal I just found."
"115740052-0-39228";"And so, the hatred between your two clans was born of a twist of fate, the shattered Lover's Coil."
"115740052-0-39229";"But today, Madearn and Eslyn have restored the Lover's Coil. Let their efforts show that you need not continue this quarrel."
"115740052-0-39230";"Thank you for the tale, honored vateshran. We will discuss this. Eslyn, Madearn, wait in the handfasting cave."
"115740052-0-39233";"Never thought I'd see this many clans in one place. Have to give Ard Caddach credit."
"115740052-0-39234";"Peace might not last. You heard what Arana's been saying?"
"115740052-0-39235";"Her warnings? Rubbish. Arana just can't bide the Ard's rule."
"115740052-0-39236";"Perhaps. I'll still sleep with one eye open."
"115740052-0-39237";"Some outsiders came through recently, asking about Arana."
"115740052-0-39238";"Think they're spying on us? Trying to see what we know about the rebels?"
"115740052-0-39239";"Aye. Or maybe for those preying on us in the wild."
"115740052-0-39240";"Better that their interest is in her than us then."
"115740052-0-39241";"Any truth to what the scouts say? About the rebels."
"115740052-0-39242";"Aye. They're soon to outnumber us."
"115740052-0-39243";"We can hold these walls even if they do."
"115740052-0-39244";"Not if they come under them. I hear they're doing a lot of digging."
"115740052-0-39245";"Bad news from down south. Chief Trynfe's clan was completely wiped out by vampires."
"115740052-0-39246";"If she'd accepted Ard Caddach's invitation, they'd still be alive."
"115740052-0-39247";"I don't know. I stay in this cursed city much longer, I might be ready to go down swinging too."
"115740052-0-39248";"When that time comes, I'll be right at your side."
"115740052-0-39249";"Scouts reported a pack of werewolves on a tear. Hunting vampires."
"115740052-0-39250";"Hircine finally send his hounds after the leeches?"
"115740052-0-39251";"Don't know whether it's Hircine's doing, but the scouts claim these wolves turned on their former masters."
"115740052-0-39252";"Hmm. Can't say I'd welcome them, but against these bloodsuckers I'll accept whatever help we can get."
"115740052-0-39253";"What a slaughter. Still can't believe we survived."
"115740052-0-39254";"Arana and her folk saved our skins."
"115740052-0-39255";"I pray Molag Bal ravages that traitorous Belain until the end of time."
"115740052-0-39256";"Aye, I'll second that oath."
"115740052-0-39257";"Witness my power!"
"115740052-0-39258";"The book isn't here. Burn this—burn it all! Our lord demands it!"
"115740052-0-39259";"Over here, five-claw!"
"115740052-0-39260";"You go. We must finish the job. I can delay these worms."
"115740052-0-39264";"You take care of Captain Important there. I'm after the fire mage!"
"115740052-0-39265";"Ah, here's one whose report we need. What news of Lady Belain?"
"115740052-0-39266";"Heh—these fools aren't so tough. Come on, their leader ran just over the hill."
"115740052-0-39267";"Come, Ravenwatch, Titanborn. We can't let the specters of the past distract us from our mission."
"115740052-0-39268";"Very well, count."
"115740052-0-39270";"Here it comes."
"115740052-0-39273";"What of the handfasting?"
"115740052-0-39274";"There will be no handfasting, father. We don't need it. This feud is foolish."
"115740052-0-39275";"The Eagleseer waif has poisoned your mind, boy. You shame me!"
"115740052-0-39276";"You lay this at my daughter's feet, Six-Ford? My warriors and I will make you regret those words."
"115740052-0-39277";"You small creatures. The book belongs to the True-Sworn!"
"115740052-0-39278";"Ah, here they come. Let us complete the rite."
"115740052-0-39279";"Finally. Let's get on with it already."
"115740052-0-39281";"Eslyn of the Eagleseer, Madearn of the Six-Ford, will you take up the vow of marriage?"
"115740052-0-39282";"Aye."
"115740052-0-39283";"And you, Madearn Six-Ford?"
"115740052-0-39284";"Aye."
"115740052-0-39285";"Then the handfasting rite is complete! Now, we've a wedding to plan!"
"115740052-0-39286";"Madearn, what becomes of us now?"
"115740052-0-39287";"How dare Nathari allow Gray Host soldiers to prowl these halls!"
"115740052-0-39288";"No. I can't do this. I am promised to Drisene, of Clan Six-Ford!"
"115740052-0-39289";"Madearn!"
"115740052-0-39291";"This insult won't stand, Six-Fords! You'll see your treachery matched with our flint."
"115740052-0-39292";"This was not my doing, Eagleseer, but if it's a fight you want, a fight you'll get."
"115740052-0-39293";"This can't be happening."
"115740052-0-39294";"Eslyn, I'm sorry. I can't go back on my word."
"115740052-0-39295";"You did the right thing, Madearn. I'm happy for you. Truly."
"115740052-0-39296";"It looks like you could use some assistance, brother."
"115740052-0-39297";"If he thinks the book is here, then we have to stop him!"
"115740052-0-39298";"A secret lair! It must be here! Keep him busy while I search."
"115740052-0-39299";"You'll never win through brute force! We need a new strategy!"
"115740052-0-39301";"You should have listened to reason, Marg. I'm trying to save the clan."
"115740052-0-39302";"I found it! Such a bizarre cover."
"115740052-0-39303";"I'm not sure this even has words. Just symbols. Hmm …."
"115740052-0-39304";"Aye, that one I know. Very well, Verandis. I'll speak to them."
"115740052-0-39305";"Ah, Arana, here comes my associate now."
"115740052-0-39306";"Eslyn, I'm glad that we came to know each other. There is a future for our clans yet."
"115740052-0-39307";"I'm glad too, Madearn. Today, we proved Six-Ford and Eagleseers can work together."
"115740052-0-39309";"I sense Master Pythis's magic. He must have been here! Look around for any sign of him."
"115740052-0-39310";"That journal! I recognize it. It's Master Pythis's!"
"115740052-0-39311";"Oh, the Dark Heart will reward me for giving it your soul!"
"115740052-0-39312";"Hey! Over here."
"115740052-0-39313";"Hang on, Freyleth. I'm coming for you."
"115740052-0-39314";"This is what you bring us, Arana? Frightened pups?"
"115740052-0-39315";"Save it for the Gray Host, skin-changer. Let's see what they can do on the training field."
"115740052-0-39316";"Frightened pups? My hunters are the equal of ten of yours! Do you care to see our claws and fangs?"
"115740052-0-39317";"I'll meet you outside the ruin, my friend."
"115740052-0-39319";"She's coming for me. I need your help! Get up here quickly!"
"115740052-0-39320";"Rada! Stop! Don't make me fight you!"
"115740052-0-39322";"Did you find something? Bring it here."
"115740052-0-39323";"Ah! I can feel it drawing on the power of the Dark Heart."
"115740052-0-39324";"The sensation … overwhelming. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-39325";"There. It's done. Let's talk before we rush in."
"115740052-0-39326";"Belain controls access to the Dark Heart. I grow tired of following her commands."
"115740052-0-39327";"My ears are burning. Is that my name on the wind?"
"115740052-0-39328";"One moment, five-claw. This one has something to say."
"115740052-0-39329";"It's too unstable! I can't control it!"
"115740052-0-39330";"Gwendis. Fennorian. You shall remain here."
"115740052-0-39331";"What? No way!"
"115740052-0-39332";"Someone must keep the orrery in operation. You may give me an earful when we return."
"115740052-0-39333";"I'm holding you to that! Understand?"
"115740052-0-39334";"Arana said they'd be this way, come o—"
"115740052-0-39335";"F—father!"
"115740052-0-39336";"You—they said you were gone …."
"115740052-0-39337";"I was. And I will be again. We have much to discuss, but I will not be returning to House Ravenwatch."
"115740052-0-39339";"But who will—"
"115740052-0-39340";"You three have no more need of a guardian. It's time I put the future of the Ravenwatch in your hands."
"115740052-0-39341";"But … you'll still visit, right?"
"115740052-0-39342";"Every chance I get."
"115740052-0-39343";"My blood … they're draining me dry …."
"115740052-0-39344";"Tell Boss Trenlor I'll do whatever he says!"
"115740052-0-39345";"More blood? Haven't you taken enough?"
"115740052-0-39346";"Don't feed me to the bloodfiends! Tell Boss Trenlor I'll pay!"
"115740052-0-39347";"There, five-claw! Kathad went down the east corridor!"
"115740052-0-39348";"Not even Molag Bal can threaten us here. The Gray Host will be an unstoppable force. Nothing will be beyond our reach."
"115740052-0-39349";"Rada. Your dream was never mine. It ends here."
"115740052-0-39350";"Verandis! We are nearly free! Verandis!"
"115740052-0-39351";"Join our forsaken kin in Molag Bal's teeth, you traitor!"
"115740052-0-39352";"I'm off. If I see something that might help, I'll let you know."
"115740052-0-39353";"There you are! Verandis thinks he found something important. He needs you."
"115740052-0-39355";"Leki is laughing on the Far Shores, dancing with her mocking blade."
"115740052-0-39356";"That wasn't as difficult as I expected. Now let's enter the archive."
"115740052-0-39357";"Ready now? Try reaching the void breach at the top of that tower."
"115740052-0-39358";"Verandis is in trouble! We have to hurry."
"115740052-0-39359";"Don't you do it, count. Don't you dare!"
"115740052-0-39384";"Gwendis, think this through."
"115740052-0-39385";"No. They slipped the noose once. That's not going to happen again."
"115740052-0-39387";"It's Rada al-Saran! This is our chance!"
"115740052-0-39388";"None of these weak strangers could face a true Reach challenge!"
"115740052-0-39389";"I'm done for, outsider. They took Faorin and the others to the tower…hurry.."
"115740052-0-39390";"Rada and Belain, we found them. Let's listen in."
"115740052-0-39392";"Reach witch prophecies? What fates are you tempting now, Rada?"
"115740052-0-39393";"Al-Saran!"
"115740052-0-39394";"Snow Lily, look! Is that … yes, it's a song!"
"115740052-0-39395";"""Reach out, Red Eagle, your destiny awaits …."""
"115740052-0-39396";"Another verse. Your turn, Sai."
"115740052-0-39397";"""Clear your mind, Red Eagle, don't surrender to the fates …."""
"115740052-0-39398";"""Fill your heart with the song that makes it roar …."""
"115740052-0-39399";"""… and let your spirit, your love, and your life, let it soar …."""
"115740052-0-39400";"""… then it will come to you, your love, your life, your sword …."""
"115740052-0-39402";"Of course, Sai! Don't you see? You never fight for what you want, only for what others need."
"115740052-0-39403";"It's a trap! Fight them off."
"115740052-0-39404";"That's it, keep feeding their souls to the Dark Heart. I can use this power."
"115740052-0-39405";"I can feel the Dark Heart tugging on those souls! Strike down more of the Gray Host—I have a plan!"
"115740052-0-39406";"Shaman Ulvoch, I couldn't reach the wards, but I think this person can help us."
"115740052-0-39407";"Look at that big boy! I'll help you from up here!"
"115740052-0-39408";"An outsider, I sense."
"115740052-0-39409";"I believe the spirits sent them to us, master."
"115740052-0-39410";"Do you? Wait outside, apprentice. I will speak to the outsider."
"115740052-0-39411";"Another sheet of parchment? Bring it here."
"115740052-0-39412";"Look how Belain corrupts Namira's gift! I'll create void portals. Use them to reach those voidmothers and destroy them!"
"115740052-0-39413";"We can defeat her. The fate of the Reach depends on it!"
"115740052-0-39414";"Shaman Ulvoch, we're back. The offerings have been placed at the wards."
"115740052-0-39415";"Shaman Ulvoch, the corruption has been dealt with!"
"115740052-0-39416";"Do not allow them to disrupt the ritual!"
"115740052-0-39417";"There is no hope. Surrender to the embrace of the Void!"
"115740052-0-39418";"The Void will consume you."
"115740052-0-39419";"Your victory is meaningless. The Void will devour everything!"
"115740052-0-39420";"I can get through to Rada. I must!"
"115740052-0-39421";"We defeated evil today. An ancient darkness at the very heart of the Reach, that threatened to destroy us all."
"115740052-0-39422";"These outsiders stood beside us and made our troubles, our enemies, their own. Let them hear our thanks!"
"115740052-0-39423";"Look around you, people of the Reach. Markarth still stands! See your fellow Reachfolk and know we will always fight for our land and our ways!"
"115740052-0-39424";"Long before the Nords laid stones and desecrated these caves, this place was sacred to my ancestors."
"115740052-0-39425";"These dead are ancient. Clearly not my sister's doing."
"115740052-0-39426";"Look out! The Dark Heart!"
"115740052-0-39427";"I can't believe she actually did it. Nathari sacrificed this Ghostsong hunter."
"115740052-0-39428";"It's … dormant. Verandis must have done it. He stopped the Darkstorm!"
"115740052-0-39429";"Rada! Stop this!"
"115740052-0-39430";"The old matrons mentioned a ritual cave deep within the barrow. It must be this way."
"115740052-0-39431";"Vengeance for Lady Belain!"
"115740052-0-39432";"Witness what a taste of the Dark Heart can do!"
"115740052-0-39433";"Duty isn't easily set aside for someone like me, Snow Lily."
"115740052-0-39434";"Focus, Sai. Just this once, fill your heart with what you need."
"115740052-0-39435";"Reach out, Red Eagle, your destiny awaits …."
"115740052-0-39436";"Clear your mind, Red Eagle, don't surrender to the fates …."
"115740052-0-39437";"Fill your heart with the song that makes it roar …."
"115740052-0-39439";"And let your spirit, your love, and your life, let it soar …."
"115740052-0-39440";"Then it will come to you, your love, your life, your sword …."
"115740052-0-39441";"Sai! Your sword! It's working!"
"115740052-0-39442";"Sai! That's amazing!"
"115740052-0-39447";"The words, they led me to the true answer. The one thing I have always loved above all else."
"115740052-0-39448";"And what was that, Sai?"
"115740052-0-39449";"I thought of you, Snow Lily. I thought of you."
"115740052-0-39455";"Chiefs, please—ah! The outsider. I'll speak to you over here."
"115740052-0-39456";"Deal with Lady Belain's minions. I'll try to stop Rada."
"115740052-0-39457";"Feed, you heart of darkness! Feed on the souls of Markarth and soon my brethren will be free!"
"115740052-0-39458";"Outsider. I bid you stay."
"115740052-0-39459";"I'll just rest my haunches a while, if it's all the same to you."
"115740052-0-39460";"This loss is … undignified …."
"115740052-0-39461";"Ah, look. An insect crawls into my lair."
"115740052-0-39462";"Don't worry, I'll catch up with you and Verandis soon."
"115740052-0-39464";"Keep at it! Put that silver we acquired to good use, you lazy goat herders!"
"115740052-0-39465";"You're back! What did the chief-of-chiefs say?"
"115740052-0-39466";"Come and gaze upon the Heart. Come and witness my true power!"
"115740052-0-39467";"The Spirit Queen led me here, harrier! I'll help you defeat this abomination!"
"115740052-0-39468";"You fools. The Dark Heart is mine to command. This is the place where your little rebellion ends."
"115740052-0-39470";"A Dwemer amplifier? Quickly, deactivate it! I'll contain the magic with a time slowing spell!"
"115740052-0-39471";"She's right, father. We don't need a handfasting to make us lower our swords. Heed the vateshran's tale."
"115740052-0-39472";"Our chance for peace is gone."
"115740052-0-39473";"Gone for today, perhaps. But not forever. Madearn and I will make sure of it."
"115740052-0-39474";"Aye. We will spread the vateshran's tale to our clans until enough heed it."
"115740052-0-39475";"Rise from your grave, defend the tree! I command you!"
"115740052-0-39476";"Have you come to join my army, then? It only takes a little seed."
"115740052-0-39477";"Welcome to the Wounding! A playground for Molag Bal's fiends."
"115740052-0-39478";"Keep your eye out for traps. The Lord of Lies enjoys his tricks."
"115740052-0-39479";"Hunter's Grotto! Ah, the memories of this place."
"115740052-0-39480";"Hircine's realm truly embodies the greatness of life in the Reach."
"115740052-0-39481";"Hmm, the Brimstone Den. Sorry about the heat. It doesn't bother me so much due to my being, well, dead."
"115740052-0-39482";"I can't say I ever liked being here. But you're not here to take in the scenery."
"115740052-0-39483";"A pity for your ghost friend. I consumed his spirit to enter this realm. And now I shall take yours!"
"115740052-0-39484";"I'll hear no more of this! Go! I want to talk to the outsider."
"115740052-0-39485";"Well, this is new. What do you make of this?"
"115740052-0-39486";"Ah! That burns! What in Oblivion is this?"
"115740052-0-39487";"More dark magic polluting the Hollows. Where does it come from?"
"115740052-0-39488";"Wait, did you hear that whisper? Uh … never mind. Let's continue."
"115740052-0-39489";"Another one! Deactivate it and I'll contain the area!"
"115740052-0-39490";"This beast stays under my protection, hunter. Only the grove's blessing can breach its defenses."
"115740052-0-39491";"Very cunning, fledgling. But do you have the strength for more?"
"115740052-0-39493";"The forest looms strong around you, fledgling hunter!"
"115740052-0-39494";"Nature turns against you, little hunter!"
"115740052-0-39495";"Death only continues the great cycle."
"115740052-0-39497";"[Aggressive grunt that acknowledges the player and initiates combat]"
"115740052-0-39498";"[Short minotaur order with tone of challenge]"
"115740052-0-39499";"[Long string of Minotaur grunts and moos]"
"115740052-0-39500";"He bids you to follow, if you possess the skill."
"115740052-0-39501";"[Minotaur growls long and low then increasing in volume as he charges up]"
"115740052-0-39503";"Ah! Your real challenge starts now!"
"115740052-0-39504";"[Short Minotaur roar ordering others to start fighting]"
"115740052-0-39505";"[Pained minotaur keening moo]"
"115740052-0-39506";"I gather he wished you well on your test, and that your death be swift."
"115740052-0-39507";"Easy, girl. I told you Hircine would send us a sign."
"115740052-0-39508";"It's working! We're nearly there!"
"115740052-0-39509";"You and I have much to discuss, Calis."
"115740052-0-39510";"Well, now. You're no Thornroot. Care to lend me a hand, stranger?"
"115740052-0-39511";"Hunt-Father, I beseech you, guide the wanderer swiftly back to us."
"115740052-0-39512";"Master, look! Your prayer has been answered!"
"115740052-0-39513";"Five relics decorate this shrine, for five are the Aspects of Lord Hircine."
"115740052-0-39514";"The five are all, the five are one. Five are true and death-in-the-woods. Five must be revered."
"115740052-0-39515";"The Hunter, Alrabeg. He brings new prey to our lands and hunts beside us."
"115740052-0-39516";"Storihbeg, the King of Wolves. He brought us the gift of skinshifting, to remind us that we are predators, not prey."
"115740052-0-39517";"Gulibeg, the Clever Fox. He teaches us secrets, tricks that helped us survive the fall of Lorkh."
"115740052-0-39518";"Hrokkibeg, the Mighty Bear. Between hunts, he reminds us of the value of solitude, peace from labors, and the quiet strength of our mortal souls."
"115740052-0-39519";"Finally Uricanbeg, the Great Stag. His hooves drum the Blood Summons that calls prey from far and wide. We will fight alongside Hircine at the end of all days."
"115740052-0-39520";"These are the Aspects of Hircine, five and no more. Hunt-Father, guide us through this life and know that we alone remember our purpose."
"115740052-0-39521";"There's another one! Deactivate it so I can slow the tonal magic!"
"115740052-0-39522";"The hunger drives me mad! I need the Dark Heart. Please!"
"115740052-0-39523";"Belain and her nobles, they keep the Dark Heart all for themselves."
"115740052-0-39524";"Look what … the hunger … does to me!"
"115740052-0-39525";"We're dying? How is that possible? We're the Nighthollow!"
"115740052-0-39526";"Gwendis and I can cover more ground on our own. Let's find the keystone!"
"115740052-0-39527";"Damn it! Belain took the keystone! And that metal beast is standing in our way!"
"115740052-0-39528";"Well struck, harrier! Now, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-39529";"The dead, returned to life—by Hircine's hounds, I still can't believe it!"
"115740052-0-39531";"Two of my clan among them. Still akin to a dream for all of us … but a pleasant one."
"115740052-0-39532";"Aye. A pleasant one, from which I hope we never wake."
"115740052-0-39533";"For a few minutes yet, at least."
"115740052-0-39534";"Thought I'd seen my brother for the last time. The fell magic just whisked him away. Wish I knew what spirits brought him back to me."
"115740052-0-39535";"They're rarely so kind, but I won't question it."
"115740052-0-39536";"Aye. The spirits never give freely, but I'd offer up every deer in the Reach if it pleased them for this."
"115740052-0-39537";"And still a bargain, I say."
"115740052-0-39538";"Look! Hircine paints our quarry in smoke and stars! Our pact has been blessed, harrier!"
"115740052-0-39539";"I sense you search for knowledge, outsider. What song do you seek?"
"115740052-0-39540";"We just got here, partner. What did you find out?"
"115740052-0-39541";"Yep, this must be the place. Hey, partner, let's talk."
"115740052-0-39542";"That's it! Keep repositioning the crystals to reflect the energy."
"115740052-0-39543";"Too late, sister! The prophecy is fulfilled!"
"115740052-0-39544";"Dear Calis, you're more of a fool than I thought."
"115740052-0-39545";"Master Pythis! Stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-39546";"The relic! Let's hurry before it becomes too unstable to move."
"115740052-0-39547";"That is most appreciated, Master Larama."
"115740052-0-39548";"It will be all right, Calis. I intend to make sure this doesn't mar your reputation in the Order."
"115740052-0-39549";"Freyleth? You … poisoned …."
"115740052-0-39550";"Boss Trenlor got exactly what he deserved. And now I want to talk to our friend here."
"115740052-0-39551";"Oh, don't worry. I didn't poison all of the chalices!"
"115740052-0-39552";"Leave him alone!"
"115740052-0-39554";"You! You need to die!"
"115740052-0-39555";"Oh no… no!"
"115740052-0-39556";"You sure you'll be all right here by yourself, Verandis?"
"115740052-0-39557";"What am I saying? Of course you will. But if you're not back soon, I'll come and drag you to Markarth myself!"
"115740052-0-39558";"Are we leaping into the gaping portal or not?"
"115740052-0-39559";"That's it, five-claw. Now let's find that lift Freyleth mentioned."
"115740052-0-39560";"The Gray Host! The Darkstorm must be working!"
"115740052-0-39561";"I did not expect any company, my friend."
"115740052-0-39562";"The bonds of friendship weave a net that will catch you when you fall."
"115740052-0-39563";"Rada said that, though the sentiment is much more martial in the original Yokudan."
"115740052-0-39564";"May you always be surrounded by those who will catch you when need them most."
"115740052-0-39565";"All of the souls are collected and must be released!"
"115740052-0-39566";"I've woven a trap! Bring Rada to me!"
"115740052-0-39567";"Ugh!"
"115740052-0-39568";"The Dark Heart must be fed! I will see to Markarth."
"115740052-0-39569";"Idrisin, slay these meddlers!"
"115740052-0-39570";"Verandis, the orrery won't slow down!"
"115740052-0-39571";"Ah, my friend, your timing is perfect. Get to the far platform and throw the switch!"
"115740052-0-39572";"It will take all of us to stop this infernal machine!"
"115740052-0-39573";"There's my partner! Over here!"
"115740052-0-39574";"Hey, partner, I think we figured it out!"
"115740052-0-39575";"Free once more! I can feel such power within these walls!"
"115740052-0-39577";"Rarely do I see such fortune, stranger. Carry it well."
"115740052-0-39578";"One that fulfills you … but does not last. You shall carry the memory of past joy to your grave."
"115740052-0-39579";"True love shall elude you, stranger. Mistress Namira sees no heart will bare itself to yours. But who knows? She might be wrong."
"115740052-0-39580";"Mighty Namira puts a challenging fight before you. One you should not expect to win … but will emerge victorious from. Hm. Lucky."
"115740052-0-39581";"You will win these contests—but your friends shall fall along the way. The mistress Namira decrees it."
"115740052-0-39582";"You shall taste death many times, wanderer. The disapproval of mistress Namira has felled many, I fear."
"115740052-0-39583";"Great Namira promises an unexpected windfall in your future, stranger."
"115740052-0-39584";"Mistress Namira promises easy riches, but they will come at a cost. Take care, or that may be your life."
"115740052-0-39585";"The Lady Namira promises no riches to you—in fact, you may die for the lack of them. A pity."
"115740052-0-39586";"His stride was the river, cutting through mountain pass and glen. His bow called the rain-death on all in his aim."
"115740052-0-39587";"It was mockery to Hircine, and it would not be abided. And so the great spirit made Fiasof new game."
"115740052-0-39588";"But Fiasof went to dress the game and saw his prey as they were: his tribe, changed by Hircine as punishment of pride."
"115740052-0-39589";"And Hircine, in his wisdom, gave it."
"115740052-0-39590";"But the blade burned bright, as did the fury left to him. And he faced the legions that bid him kneel."
"115740052-0-39591";"Blade and arrow found him, time and again. Faolan did not fight to win. His aim was punishment."
"115740052-0-39592";"The tomb was opened and the eagle flew no longer."
"115740052-0-39593";"He strove to show the world Reach spirit, the one that bade them kneel. But though they named him emperor, their hearts were never his."
"115740052-0-39594";"The fools did feast him lavishly, they sought finery for his naked breast."
"115740052-0-39595";"He bade the court forgo its decadence, for then it might know strength and pride it lost before it fell."
"115740052-0-39596";"And so Leovic left the city of Anvil in disgust, and darkened its doorway no longer."
"115740052-0-39597";"Damn witch-rebels are as bad as the damn vampires!"
"115740052-0-39598";"Over here, my friend. How went your audience with the ard?"
"115740052-0-39601";"I thought I smelled an intruder!"
"115740052-0-39602";"[Sharp Warning Minotaur Growl challenging player]"
"115740052-0-39603";"[Minotaur triumphantly roars in victory!]"
"115740052-0-39604";"Use the void portals to reach the shades, harrier!"
"115740052-0-39605";"The claw that spills the jub-bile must be the one to sop it, dryskin. Heed the words and tend to this matter."
"115740052-0-39606";"Riddles? Really? Not helpful, priest. Not helpful at all."
"115740052-0-39607";"To think, I only had a single Stibbons to deal with when the day began."
"115740052-0-39608";"Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39609";"Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39610";"Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39611";"Master … must be … free!"
"115740052-0-39612";"Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39613";"All right, you Stibbonses—attention!"
"115740052-0-39614";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39615";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39616";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-39619";"Oh, Clarisse, what hardships you must endure …."
"115740052-0-39620";"Back again, dryskin? The claw that spills the jub-bile …."
"115740052-0-39621";"Save the platitudes and talk to my associate, priest."
"115740052-0-39622";"Hmm. Very well."
"115740052-0-39623";"This is … impressive."
"115740052-0-39624";"A sorcerer? Now that's something I can work with! I'll meet you in the xanmeer."
"115740052-0-39625";"If you insist on following me, then step lively, Stibbonses!"
"115740052-0-39626";"Gideon is not the ground on which we conduct this fight. There is a better place to defend the Ambitions."
"115740052-0-39628";"Hmm, I think I have an idea."
"115740052-0-39630";"Brigadines, take your positions! The enemy could arrive at any time. Eveli, take the Ambitions to the guardhouse!"
"115740052-0-39631";"Black Fin Legion, to me!"
"115740052-0-39633";"Councilor Jirich! Damn, we're too late!"
"115740052-0-39634";"And it will, Belain. Soon. With the keystone, we can come and go as we please. Now, let us leave this place. We still have much to do before we restart the orrery."
"115740052-0-39635";"Whatever you did in the south wing didn't unlock the main doors."
"115740052-0-39636";"But it did open the door to the north wing. I suppose I'll have to send you and the duplicates there next."
"115740052-0-39637";"What interest does a Dagon cult have in this place, flea?"
"115740052-0-39638";"Do your worst, Dremora! I'll tell you nothing!"
"115740052-0-39639";"I'll squeeze the knowledge out of—"
"115740052-0-39640";"Any sign of Vandacia's forces, Captain Rian?"
"115740052-0-39641";"I just received word. The Waking Flame has arrived. And they have portal mages with them! Eveli, take the Ambitions to the guardhouse!"
"115740052-0-39642";"I'll protect them! You stay here and defend the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-39643";"Brigadine archers, support the mercenary!"
"115740052-0-39645";"Portals! Cut down the cultists!"
"115740052-0-39646";"Heard you might need a little help in here!"
"115740052-0-39647";"Hold the courtyard, lieutenant. Mercenary, go check on the Ambitions."
"115740052-0-39649";"Oh, good, you're here. A little help, please!"
"115740052-0-39650";"Cracked acorns! I lost track of Sombren and the twins. They ran west!"
"115740052-0-39651";"Over here, mercenary!"
"115740052-0-39652";"Vandacia's forces, they're everywhere!"
"115740052-0-39653";"Sombren, I sense more of them. They're coming!"
"115740052-0-39654";"All of you, under the shield!"
"115740052-0-39655";"Got the information we need? Good."
"115740052-0-39656";"Sombren, you're only delaying the inevitable."
"115740052-0-39657";"Monster! Because of you, our parents are dead!"
"115740052-0-39658";"They were the chosen of Mehrunes Dagon, rewarded beyond their station."
"115740052-0-39659";"I'm going to kill you, Vandacia!"
"115740052-0-39660";"Destron, no!"
"115740052-0-39661";"Who shall I sacrifice first? Perhaps the sister …?"
"115740052-0-39662";"You leave Calia alone, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-39663";"Destron!"
"115740052-0-39664";"You are an Ambition, boy. Let me help you fulfill your purpose!"
"115740052-0-39665";"The sky! And Mehrunes Dagon! How is he here?"
"115740052-0-39666";"No!"
"115740052-0-39667";"Keep going. Move!"
"115740052-0-39668";"Into the keep! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-39669";"I think we're getting closer."
"115740052-0-39670";"This is my opposition? How easily I shall crush them!"
"115740052-0-39671";"Belain, spare Verandis and his cherished daughter. Dispose of the rest."
"115740052-0-39672";"Stay alert. I have it on good authority that I'm in danger."
"115740052-0-39673";"Of course, councilor."
"115740052-0-39674";"There's Stibbons! Inside that … thing."
"115740052-0-39675";"The sorcerer's shield! We need to destroy it!"
"115740052-0-39676";"The shield is down! Get Stibbons out of there while I keep the voriplasm in place!"
"115740052-0-39677";"No! It cannot end like this!"
"115740052-0-39678";"Stibbons? Tell me you're unharmed."
"115740052-0-39679";"Not here. Let's return to the first hall."
"115740052-0-39680";"As you say, m'lady."
"115740052-0-39681";"My lady, I must apologize. I seem to have mucked everything up again."
"115740052-0-39682";"Yes, but I've grown accustomed to your antics. Besides, I had a very capable assistant."
"115740052-0-39683";"We weren't expecting visitors. Are you here to see the councilor?"
"115740052-0-39684";"Well done, Lady Laurent! I sense the curse has been broken. Even now, I feel the last vestiges of the sorcerer slipping away. Except for what remains in the shiny-headed one, of course."
"115740052-0-39685";"What? That's ridiculous! I'm fine! My lady safely extracted me from the … blob of sorcerer."
"115740052-0-39686";"The sorcerer's goo lingers, like nose slime on a hatchling's claw."
"115740052-0-39687";"Ah! Goo! Shoo, shoo!"
"115740052-0-39688";"Stibbons, I won't tolerate muck in my manor house!"
"115740052-0-39689";"No. No! Get back!"
"115740052-0-39691";"I hate you! Just leave us alone!"
"115740052-0-39692";"Calia, you can't unleash your power like that! You could lose control!"
"115740052-0-39693";"What does it matter? You saw what he did to Destron. He's going to do the same to us."
"115740052-0-39696";"Get up, mortal! Your weakness embarrasses us both."
"115740052-0-39697";"Hmm … someone approaches. Doesn't appear to be from the Waking Flame."
"115740052-0-39698";"Can you talk to them? I just need to catch my breath."
"115740052-0-39699";"Oh hey, over here!"
"115740052-0-39701";"Ah, the Wood Elf and the mercenary. Report!"
"115740052-0-39702";"We need to speak with Councilor Lovidicus, captain, but my friend will give you their report!"
"115740052-0-39703";"Broken branches! What happened here?"
"115740052-0-39704";"Vandacia sacrificed Destron, allowing Mehrunes Dagon to drag us into his realm. Eveli, I need the book you're carrying."
"115740052-0-39705";"You know about that?"
"115740052-0-39706";"It's a part of Dagon, just like Calia and me. I sensed it the moment I met you. I think I can use it to weaken Vandacia. Give us a fighting chance."
"115740052-0-39707";"All right … what are you going to do with it?"
"115740052-0-39708";"Take the fight to Vandacia in the courtyard. He won't expect that. Meanwhile, I need time to prepare."
"115740052-0-39709";"Go fight the super powerful Daedric priest? How?"
"115740052-0-39710";"Just keep him busy. Then, with the help of this book, I'll take care of the rest."
"115740052-0-39711";"All right, Sombren needs us to buy him some time. Let's get to the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-39712";"Jela? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-39713";"Captain Rian and the Ivory Brigade will deal with the Dark Brotherhood. We're perfectly safe in here."
"115740052-0-39715";"Thank you, friend."
"115740052-0-39716";"Fort Blueblood? That's to the east, across the river. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-39717";"The pain! Agh!"
"115740052-0-39718";"Look, Councilor Lovidicus and Captain Rian sent me. I need to see Councilor Abor now!"
"115740052-0-39719";"I erect the spine of gratitude to you."
"115740052-0-39720";"And what about my sister? She hasn't been seen since she took the councilor her meal!"
"115740052-0-39721";"Councilor Abor was very clear about this. She doesn't want to be disturbed."
"115740052-0-39722";"Help me, please!"
"115740052-0-39723";"Many thanks. Be careful, Jela."
"115740052-0-39724";"The idol is no more. Let us leave this place."
"115740052-0-39725";"Oh gods, help me!"
"115740052-0-39726";"No!"
"115740052-0-39727";"Abor's meal is still warm. So what happened to the servant that delivered it?"
"115740052-0-39729";"Get ready, Calia! Just like I showed you!"
"115740052-0-39730";"You're going to pay, Vandacia! Mercenary, help us drain his power!"
"115740052-0-39731";"The master's tome? Give me that, boy!"
"115740052-0-39735";"My death will change nothing! The merge is almost complete!"
"115740052-0-39739";"Of course they tore out the pages and took them! Just when we were so close to finding out more about the Ambitions!"
"115740052-0-39740";"I will not fail, doombringer! I'll have the wards down momentarily."
"115740052-0-39741";"Interesting. This ward is … different. Perhaps a divination will provide insight …."
"115740052-0-39742";"Complex … more layers than previous wards … wait! I sense intruders. Keep them back while I finish my work!"
"115740052-0-39743";"Eat arrows, creepy cult lady!"
"115740052-0-39744";"My arrows always strike true! Can you open that Imperial cache?"
"115740052-0-39745";"Hang on. Who goes there?"
"115740052-0-39746";"Hey! Hey, over here! I need some help."
"115740052-0-39747";"Look, in the cage! Survivors!"
"115740052-0-39748";"Ugh. Thank you. Look around, would you? I'd like to examine whatever my attacker dropped."
"115740052-0-39749";"You'll never take me alive, you bastards!"
"115740052-0-39750";"Indeed. I will see them to safety."
"115740052-0-39752";"I can open this! Give me a moment."
"115740052-0-39753";"Here—you're free!"
"115740052-0-39755";"Die, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-39756";"You defeated my high priest, mortals? That was … unexpected."
"115740052-0-39757";"And before he completed the merging. That is unfortunate."
"115740052-0-39758";"Though this realm slips from my grasp, your fate is inevitable. You will join me or die, Ambitions. It is why you were created."
"115740052-0-39759";"We did it. We stopped Vandacia from merging the realms and opening the way for Mehrunes Dagon."
"115740052-0-39760";"But my brother … Destron is still dead …."
"115740052-0-39761";"I failed Destron, but I won't fail you."
"115740052-0-39762";"All right! Without Vandacia or his master, the cult doesn't stand a chance!"
"115740052-0-39763";"At least the sky looks normal again."
"115740052-0-39767";"I … I need to get out of this place."
"115740052-0-39768";"This way, Calia. Come with me."
"115740052-0-39769";"Did you find something? Here, let me have a look."
"115740052-0-39770";"More cages! I can check for survivors while you clear the Daedra."
"115740052-0-39771";"They are all dead. Keep moving. Just give me a moment."
"115740052-0-39772";"Seeks! Hold on, I'll get the lock!"
"115740052-0-39773";"Erilthel! I told you to run!"
"115740052-0-39774";"I did, but then I ran into our friend here and—hey, did you let yourself get caught so I could get away?"
"115740052-0-39775";"Pfft, unlike you I know when to make an escape. You. Come here. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-39776";"Dra … Drathas? You're here?"
"115740052-0-39777";"There we go! One picked lock, courtesy of Lady Twilight."
"115740052-0-39778";"Next time, keep your eyes off the lock. Work by feel and watch your surroundings."
"115740052-0-39779";"Oh, good point! So, I get that I'm supposed to lead the hostages to safety, but what happens after they're all free?"
"115740052-0-39780";"Then it's your turn to get clear of this place, like I told you before. And you'll listen, this time. It's too dangerous with your amount of training."
"115740052-0-39781";"But what about—"
"115740052-0-39782";"Hey—whoever you are, get these chains off of us!"
"115740052-0-39783";"Uncle! You're hurt!"
"115740052-0-39784";"You shouldn't be here Drathas. These people, they're too dangerous."
"115740052-0-39785";"Take down that Ogrim guard! I must tend to my uncle."
"115740052-0-39786";"Don't worry, I have help. Where is father?"
"115740052-0-39787";"Taken … by Baron Zaudrus. Please, Drathas. Flee this place."
"115740052-0-39788";"Uncle, I know I can save my father. I know I can help."
"115740052-0-39789";"Uncle? No!"
"115740052-0-39790";"Continue on. I will catch up."
"115740052-0-39791";"Are you here to liberate Borderwatch? I might know something that can help!"
"115740052-0-39792";"Who are—oh, who cares. Help us!"
"115740052-0-39793";"Kaoc, that's better."
"115740052-0-39794";"Who—whoever you are, please help me!"
"115740052-0-39795";"Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-39796";"Tell me that's the last of them. All this running is drying my scales."
"115740052-0-39797";"Erilthel … if I turn around and you are standing behind me, then so help me …."
"115740052-0-39798";"Seeks, how am I ever going to become a legend if I run at the first sign of trouble?"
"115740052-0-39799";"Running is half the job! Not that you would know."
"115740052-0-39800";"Well, never running is what'll set Lady Twilight apart from the rest!"
"115740052-0-39801";"Enough with Lady …! Look, I'm going to need a moment to smack some sense into my pupil. Head into the keep and see if you can find the scholar. I'll be right after."
"115740052-0-39802";"We're going to review the lesson on following instructions."
"115740052-0-39803";"Maybe there's more to this place than meets the eye."
"115740052-0-39804";"First time I've had to look for Quistley in such a … rustic location. Not his usual style."
"115740052-0-39806";"Hsst! Over here! Let me out before these cultists kill me!"
"115740052-0-39807";"Let me out, too! There's a cult of Sithis in these caves. They sacrifice people!"
"115740052-0-39808";"Keep your voice down! Those lunatics will hear you!"
"115740052-0-39810";"Is this how you treat esteemed scholars on the mainland? I am Teldundindo of Sunhold! The Teldundind—oh …."
"115740052-0-39811";"Who are you?"
"115740052-0-39812";"Right. Friend, you get the key. I'll keep tabs on the Painted Eye. Erilthel will lead the scholar to safety. And after that, she won't come back. Right?"
"115740052-0-39813";"Understood. Lesson learned!"
"115740052-0-39814";"All right, mister scholar. The way to freedom is just a quick romp through the castle sewers."
"115740052-0-39815";"Sewer? I'm a distinguished fellow of the College of Sapiarchs! Do you expect me to muck about in filth?"
"115740052-0-39816";"Oh, it'll be fine. You won't even smell it after a few minutes, unless you're planning to keep those robes, because, whew, that is not going to wash out."
"115740052-0-39817";"Hmm. That confirms that Gavos stole the Golden Anvil away. But where?"
"115740052-0-39818";"Over here! The Painted Eye are already inside! We need to keep after them!"
"115740052-0-39819";"Tell me where to find my father, monster!"
"115740052-0-39820";"Gavos must not have been popular if even his own soldiers turned on him."
"115740052-0-39821";"These merchant lords may be the last people to see Gavos alive, but did they find the anvil?"
"115740052-0-39822";"Continue the ritual! I've nearly gained control!"
"115740052-0-39823";"The relic's got to be behind that barrier! We've got to stop whatever it is they're doing. Quickly!"
"115740052-0-39824";"Imagine how many times this helm saved the heroic Phalevon's head! Except that last time, obviously."
"115740052-0-39825";"His armor shone by the light of moons or sun! It's just too bad Minotaurs are enraged by shiny objects."
"115740052-0-39826";"I can just picture this sword cleaving savage Minotaurs! A pity it's dull beyond use now."
"115740052-0-39827";"Escapees? Not on my watch."
"115740052-0-39828";"Phalevon's horn, just as the stories described it! Did this Goblin sound the note we heard?"
"115740052-0-39829";"Oh, come on! We smashed all the things!"
"115740052-0-39830";"Fools! Nothing can disrupt this ritual while I possess the power of—"
"115740052-0-39831";"Whoa, whoa, wh—ah!"
"115740052-0-39832";"… this relic …. Argh!"
"115740052-0-39833";"Father? Do you expect me to see any mortals as individuals? You're just flesh and muscle."
"115740052-0-39834";"Whew! Whatever that was really cushioned my fall. What'd I miss?"
"115740052-0-39835";"You know what? I'll take it. Now, let's get out of here! This whole place is coming down!"
"115740052-0-39836";"Let's take this monster down! I can help!"
"115740052-0-39837";"Erilthel."
"115740052-0-39838";"I know. I said I wouldn't come back, but I heard yelling echoing up from a grate—and I was worried—so I followed—and it was slippery and—"
"115740052-0-39839";"Thank you. If it weren't for you, we couldn't have stopped the Painted Eye."
"115740052-0-39840";"You mean it? It was a pretty dramatic entrance wasn't it? Maybe I should practice—"
"115740052-0-39841";"It's worse than I thought up ahead. They used the captives to excavate an old Mehrunes Dagon shrine."
"115740052-0-39842";"It seems they prepare to sacrifice the captives who still live."
"115740052-0-39843";"Sacrifice? My father could be one of them! Let's hurry!"
"115740052-0-39844";"Now, I need to figure out how to tell the Guild that we didn't get the relic. They won't be happy."
"115740052-0-39845";"What do you mean? I have the relic right here. Oh! Careful, still got bits of Painted Eye lady on it."
"115740052-0-39846";"What? When did you—"
"115740052-0-39847";"When you were all: oh, look at the ceiling, it's coming down around us. This is why I should take the lead next time!"
"115740052-0-39848";"Absolutely not."
"115740052-0-39849";"We mean you no harm! We're looking for someone."
"115740052-0-39850";"Thank you. We've been here for days."
"115740052-0-39851";"I'm sorry … I need to get out of here"
"115740052-0-39852";"Before we continue, let's talk a moment."
"115740052-0-39853";"Hmm. Such a measly energy barrier. Easily removed."
"115740052-0-39856";"Let's corner one of these cultists. They might know what's happened to Quistley."
"115740052-0-39857";"Go on, Calia. Unleash your power. Just like back in the sanctum."
"115740052-0-39858";"All right, if you say so."
"115740052-0-39859";"No, wait!"
"115740052-0-39860";"Something's wrong!"
"115740052-0-39861";"Pull back, Calia. Pull back!"
"115740052-0-39862";"I can't!"
"115740052-0-39863";"Hold on. Let me help. There!"
"115740052-0-39864";"How did you do that?"
"115740052-0-39865";"Practice. I trained to control my powers after I left my vault."
"115740052-0-39866";"I don't believe him. I think he knows more than he says he does."
"115740052-0-39869";"You'd better not lay a finger on me! You have no idea who you're dealing with."
"115740052-0-39870";"Zenithar, give me patience."
"115740052-0-39871";"That's … a Dremora!"
"115740052-0-39872";"Sombren, what's going on here?"
"115740052-0-39873";"Please! I'll tell you anything you want. Just let me go!"
"115740052-0-39874";"All I ask is that you all keep an open mind."
"115740052-0-39875";"Easy, everyone. This is Xynaa. She can help us. Mercenary, why don't you speak to her?"
"115740052-0-39876";"Sorry it took me so long to get here. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-39877";"Hmm, that's just the cover letter. The detailed invitation is missing. And so is the coin."
"115740052-0-39878";"This place is crawling with Waking Flame cultists. We'll need to be careful."
"115740052-0-39880";"What? The soldiers were bribed? After all that talk about righteous rebellion? It leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
"115740052-0-39881";"Trade-minister Esdir trafficked in skooma. No wonder Zenithar abandoned them."
"115740052-0-39882";"So they knew where Gavos had the anvil, they just wanted the opportunity to steal it for their own gain instead of returning it to the people."
"115740052-0-39883";"Can you believe it, Calia? We're going to be great heroes."
"115740052-0-39884";"What's heroic about being consumed by our own powers?"
"115740052-0-39885";"Xynaa taught Sombren to control his powers. She'll do the same for us."
"115740052-0-39886";"If the cultists or our own powers don't kill us first."
"115740052-0-39887";"Come now, sister, where's your sense of adventure?"
"115740052-0-39888";"What if Xynaa only wants to use us for our power, Destron?"
"115740052-0-39889";"She can't force us. You heard her. She needs allies, and we're as powerful as they come!"
"115740052-0-39890";"I've read the stories. Pacts with Daedra never turn out well."
"115740052-0-39891";"I'll protect you, Calia. You have my word!"
"115740052-0-39892";"Silly little brother. I'm the one who protects you."
"115740052-0-39893";"You're barely older. Only by a moment!"
"115740052-0-39895";"Two slivers of the Deadlands, one for each of us. Mission accomplished!"
"115740052-0-39896";"I fear it just gets more difficult from here."
"115740052-0-39897";"You worry about everything. Let's go meet Sombren!"
"115740052-0-39898";"Farrul? No, no, no!"
"115740052-0-39900";"<Hums merrily>"
"115740052-0-39901";"Destron stop! This is serious."
"115740052-0-39902";"Relax, Calia. We're on an adventure!"
"115740052-0-39903";"Destron, be serious! Our own powers could destroy us!"
"115740052-0-39904";"That won't happen! I won't let it."
"115740052-0-39905";"It might not be up to you."
"115740052-0-39906";"Calia … we'll figure this out."
"115740052-0-39907";"We're doing this to avoid all that. Did you gather the slivers?"
"115740052-0-39908";"Ah, Lyranth. Your reputation precedes you. I find you … useful."
"115740052-0-39909";"Helpful of you. What else can you tell me?"
"115740052-0-39910";"Help! Break these crystals! Please, they're killing me!"
"115740052-0-39911";"Let's begin."
"115740052-0-39913";"Praise Vehk! Thank you, stranger. Let's talk. Somewhere safer."
"115740052-0-39916";"Those idiots were going to sacrifice me to Sithis!"
"115740052-0-39917";"Is that …? No, this can't be the Golden Anvil, can it?"
"115740052-0-39918";"It was abandoned to the hardships of time, as I was, but the anvil's sparkle began to fade well before the abbey's fall. I should have worked harder."
"115740052-0-39919";"It can't be. Are you … Gavos Douar? It's been nearly—how are you alive?"
"115740052-0-39924";"It's working! Just a moment more, and …."
"115740052-0-39925";"What? Why isn't it—? Good grief."
"115740052-0-39926";"Hmm. This ward, it appears to require a special key. Disastrix Maglagor, deal with the interlopers!"
"115740052-0-39927";"No, that's not right. Let's try again."
"115740052-0-39928";"That creature hits hard. I think he cracked a rib."
"115740052-0-39929";"Just go on ahead. I can't do this."
"115740052-0-39930";"No, not fast enough. Let's start again."
"115740052-0-39931";"The cultists definitely go on and on about Sithis."
"115740052-0-39932";"Finally. Now then. These varla stones are clouded. Some manner of arcane erosion. They must be the source of Revus's trouble."
"115740052-0-39933";"Destroying them in this state could generate an explosive burst of magicka. And draining their power is no small feat …."
"115740052-0-39934";"Unless, of course, you happen to be me. Smash away, hero, and let's get out of this place."
"115740052-0-39935";"The wardrobe's empty. Looks like Amnis has already left for the event—whatever it is."
"115740052-0-39936";"Tiras! The interference! I think it may come from clouded—"
"115740052-0-39937";"Varla stones? Indeed. The help and I already dealt with them. You're welcome."
"115740052-0-39938";"Oh. Well, thank you. I—wait. Does anyone else feel that?"
"115740052-0-39939";"A spirit! Stand back, both of you. It's time for a true test of the Phantasmal Censer!"
"115740052-0-39940";"Get it away from me! B-back, you creature! I mean it!"
"115740052-0-39941";"Wait, Tiras! No! Argh!"
"115740052-0-39942";"You're not part of this cult, are you? In fact, you appear to be … lost."
"115740052-0-39943";"We need to find something to point us in Vandacia's direction."
"115740052-0-39944";"Who are you? Why did you take my people?"
"115740052-0-39945";"What—what is happening to me?"
"115740052-0-39946";"Oh, Tiras! Even now, I can hear him in my mind! Haunting me!"
"115740052-0-39947";"Out of the way, fly!"
"115740052-0-39948";"Baron Zaudrus. We meet at last."
"115740052-0-39949";"Lyranth. You are mine!"
"115740052-0-39950";"Your comrade is correct. There's a hidden door."
"115740052-0-39951";"Wait. We should talk before going farther."
"115740052-0-39952";"Let me know when you're done. I'll head out for now."
"115740052-0-39953";"Wait! Would you do me a favor in return?"
"115740052-0-39954";"Over there! It's Tiras!"
"115740052-0-39955";"This is it! Vehk's head … it's not a cluster of glass. It's an entire well!"
"115740052-0-39956";"All right, let's go over the plan."
"115740052-0-39957";"It's working! We did it! Tiras, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-39958";"Revus! I—I …."
"115740052-0-39959";"Oh dear. Uh … there, there Tiras. Why don't we head back to camp, all right?"
"115740052-0-39961";"Damn. A dead end and a vampire in a cage. This isn't terribly helpful."
"115740052-0-39964";"I'm writing the magisters straight away, Revus. You'll receive accolades aplenty."
"115740052-0-39965";"Over here! We have work to do!"
"115740052-0-39966";"Quistley! Where are you?"
"115740052-0-39967";"Good. I saw a rough map of this place before I got caught, so I think I know where to go."
"115740052-0-39969";"Ha! I knew it. I never grow tired of being correct."
"115740052-0-39971";"There, those big doors. I believe that's where we'll find the Daughter of Sithis and the mage's brother."
"115740052-0-39972";"Hold on Quistley! I'm coming!"
"115740052-0-39973";"Oh. You're already here."
"115740052-0-39975";"Well, let's just make a party of it then and march on in."
"115740052-0-39977";"Bastian? What are you doing here? Go away!"
"115740052-0-39978";"Well, we can't wait any longer. We should begin the experiment."
"115740052-0-39979";"Oh great, the scary Daedra lady is back."
"115740052-0-39980";"Flattery and cuteness will get you nowhere, Elf. Come, little mortal, I have information."
"115740052-0-39987";"They really want to stop us, huh? Throwing everything they can in our way."
"115740052-0-39988";"How dare you! Lalais would never have hurt me. She said so!"
"115740052-0-39989";"She murders people, you … you … idiot. You were probably next."
"115740052-0-39990";"<snort laugh>"
"115740052-0-39991";"I'm not talking to you, Bastian. Nor to that rude Dark Elf that just laughed at me."
"115740052-0-39994";"All right, just like we discussed. Focus on the slivers of Deadlands."
"115740052-0-39995";"It's working!"
"115740052-0-39996";"I've never traveled by portal before .…"
"115740052-0-39997";"I want to finish this. I know that together we can. Let's do it."
"115740052-0-39998";"Quick, step inside! Follow when you're ready, friend."
"115740052-0-40002";"I'm right here!"
"115740052-0-40003";"If I bring Quistley's signet ring to Larz-Tul, he'll believe me."
"115740052-0-40004";"That's what I was thinking. I'll tell the Silvelles that Quistley sold the ring to pay his debt."
"115740052-0-40005";"What? My ring? I'm not giving you a damn thing! Bastian, keep that woman away from me!"
"115740052-0-40006";"I … I can't! Help me! Use … the censer!"
"115740052-0-40007";"The light! The clouded light! It calls!"
"115740052-0-40008";"Hurry! I can't— Any longer—!"
"115740052-0-40009";"Brothers and sisters of the Waking Flame, behold our future!"
"115740052-0-40010";"This is one of the fabled Four Ambitions of Mehrunes Dagon, and his death will elevate us all!"
"115740052-0-40011";"Like the others of his kind, he was created from birth for one purpose—to give us his power and grant our dark lord a connection to the mortal plane!"
"115740052-0-40012";"It's … so close!"
"115740052-0-40013";"Here you go. I'll make sure Quistley understands to stay away from Blackwood."
"115740052-0-40015";"Thank you. This should clear my account with Larz-Tul. And perhaps clear yours with this ingrate and his family, too."
"115740052-0-40016";"Argh! Help—!"
"115740052-0-40017";"Ah, this must be the day you learn you are destined to fail. That I and the Waking Flame emerged victorious!"
"115740052-0-40018";"More captives! Maybe some are still breathing."
"115740052-0-40019";"Thank you, governor. Ah, here's my partner now."
"115740052-0-40020";"Vandacia, a cultist? Gideon will help in any way we can."
"115740052-0-40021";"All dead. Nothing but skin and bone. Completely worked to death."
"115740052-0-40022";"Look! Down below! What are they doing?"
"115740052-0-40023";"Mehrunes Dagon, show me where to find your Four Ambitions!"
"115740052-0-40024";"Step through the portal and prove your worth to the lord of fire and flood!"
"115740052-0-40025";"That cracked acorn is stepping into Oblivion?"
"115740052-0-40026";"Look, behind the statue! A portal! Come on!"
"115740052-0-40027";"Go, my friend. Go see Eveli. The twins and I have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-40028";"Oh, ow! Hoo. There's something unpleasant going on all right."
"115740052-0-40029";"Looks like they're doing alchemy here. With the harrada vines! Let's see what they're up to."
"115740052-0-40030";"Mercenary! Time to go. Through the portal, quickly!"
"115740052-0-40031";"Vandacia … he had us displayed like … trophies …."
"115740052-0-40032";"We saw our future … we're doomed …."
"115740052-0-40033";"Snap out of it! What you saw was just one possible inevitability. Nothing is set in stone."
"115740052-0-40036";"Mortal who bore witness for the twin Ambitions, let us speak."
"115740052-0-40037";"Right, so if that's north, that means … wait, that's not right. Ugh! Morwha's mercy …. A little help, anyone?"
"115740052-0-40038";"Over here! Let's talk!"
"115740052-0-40039";"We must begin the ritual at once. This way."
"115740052-0-40040";"Stay close, friend. I'll feel better knowing you're nearby."
"115740052-0-40041";"What's happening? What's going on?"
"115740052-0-40042";"Xynaa, what are you doing?"
"115740052-0-40043";"Helping you fulfill your purpose. You are Ambitions. You belong to Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40044";"Your sister is fine, this one is certain."
"115740052-0-40045";"A portal from Oblivion? And you, little mortal, emerging with hardly a scratch! Come, tell me everything."
"115740052-0-40046";"Now that the scary Daedra lady is gone, let's talk."
"115740052-0-40047";"Then where could she be? She would never neglect her duties."
"115740052-0-40048";"Uh … what happened?"
"115740052-0-40049";"No, Xynaa, damn it! You betrayed us!"
"115740052-0-40050";"This isn't the end little mortals. You will never be free!"
"115740052-0-40051";"Probably found a dark corner and someone to snuggle with. This one does that all the time."
"115740052-0-40052";"I can feel the residual energy. Hold the skull toward me, please."
"115740052-0-40053";"All right, I'm ready. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-40054";"She's doing something to the twins!"
"115740052-0-40055";"I'll help Calia and Destron. You deal with Xynaa."
"115740052-0-40056";"You're too late! Lord Dagon will reward me for securing the twins!"
"115740052-0-40057";"The Ambitions belong to Lord Dagon! Their power is for him alone!"
"115740052-0-40058";"My master will reward me for destroying you!"
"115740052-0-40059";"If only you truly understood the nature of the Ambitions."
"115740052-0-40063";"Ask about the lamp."
"115740052-0-40064";"You want my Ambitions? Then prove your worth and destroy the intruders!"
"115740052-0-40065";"All right, grab a broom and start sweeping."
"115740052-0-40066";"And do you see Talaise anywhere? No? Then start sweeping!"
"115740052-0-40067";"What? No! That's Talaise's job!"
"115740052-0-40068";"Looks like they've been harvesting the harrada vines. Awful lot of them."
"115740052-0-40069";"Some kind of alchemical concoction. Made from the creeper, I reckon."
"115740052-0-40072";"Yuck, paper. Turns my stomach to think of some poor tree being hacked to bits and pulverized so folk can tattoo their taxes onto them. Wait, I don't think Sul-Xan keep ledgers."
"115740052-0-40073";"About time you showed. I started to think I would have to break out without you."
"115740052-0-40074";"What in all of Nirn is this?"
"115740052-0-40075";"Take out those Daedra guarding her. I'll see if I can find anything useful up top."
"115740052-0-40076";"Well, someone's been here recently. Let's keep an eye out while we look for the creeper."
"115740052-0-40077";"Xynaa … she was going to sacrifice us to Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40078";"Sombren! How could you bring us to this … this monster?"
"115740052-0-40079";"Before we check the pantry, let's talk."
"115740052-0-40080";"She wasn't like this. I didn't know."
"115740052-0-40081";"Destron, help me open a portal. Like Sombren showed us on the hilltop."
"115740052-0-40082";"I'm sorry. I had no idea Xynaa meant to betray us."
"115740052-0-40083";"She wanted to kill us, Sombren! An apology isn't going to cut it!"
"115740052-0-40084";"Destron, Xynaa betrayed Sombren, too."
"115740052-0-40085";"Because he was stupid enough to trust her!"
"115740052-0-40086";"I will make this right. I promise."
"115740052-0-40087";"Let's return to the temple. We shouldn't be discussing this in the street."
"115740052-0-40088";"You made it! All right, this is the place where people see the spirit. Go on and try out the lantern!"
"115740052-0-40089";"Oh, there's definitely some creepy creeper tingles in here. I think we're on the right trail."
"115740052-0-40090";"Help! Please!"
"115740052-0-40091";"That's horrible! We've got to do something."
"115740052-0-40092";"Who intrudes upon my grief? Giovesse is lost. My son is lost. All that remains is sorrow!"
"115740052-0-40093";"Tava's feathers, I was right! Ha! All right, you talk. I'll take notes."
"115740052-0-40094";"Tumma-Maxath already uncovered the remains. Quickly, destroy them."
"115740052-0-40095";"Time is a force of change. We should hurry."
"115740052-0-40097";"Tumma-Maxath will not have these remains."
"115740052-0-40098";"The skull of this Shadowscale is missing. I think I know why."
"115740052-0-40099";"There, that must be Ajum-Shei's skull."
"115740052-0-40100";"It is done. Praise Sithis the Changer."
"115740052-0-40101";"Y'ffre help me, it's everywhere! And so are the prisoners …."
"115740052-0-40102";"This is the cottage the duchess mentioned, I think. Not all that romantic, is it? Let's look around."
"115740052-0-40103";"Who … who's there? Alizinda, my love. Is it you?"
"115740052-0-40104";"So, this is Mathen? Gracious. Grandmother Alizinda clearly knew how to pick them."
"115740052-0-40105";"My lady. Forgive my impertinence, but you are the very image of my lost love, Alizinda. How could this be?"
"115740052-0-40106";"Oh my goodness. I, uhm … I believe I'm her descendant, brave sir duke. Er, baron. Whatever. My name's Yisara, by the way. What were we talking about again?"
"115740052-0-40107";"You share her spirit, Lady Yisara. At last, fate grants me a kindness."
"115740052-0-40108";"Well, here we are, and not a scrap of golden armor in sight. Let's have a look around."
"115740052-0-40109";"What are you doing here? Why aren't you caring for my boy?"
"115740052-0-40110";"Necromancy? How could she—?"
"115740052-0-40111";"You! Oh, I see you well enough, Redguard! You think I don't notice the family resemblance? You stay away from my boy!"
"115740052-0-40112";"Tava's feathers … bit touchy, isn't she?"
"115740052-0-40113";"Is that—Damn it, they murdered Talaise, too!"
"115740052-0-40116";"Time for the final ritual, my emperor."
"115740052-0-40118";"That did it! Finally, I can get down from this inane trap."
"115740052-0-40120";"Why would the Dark Brotherhood murder—oh no! We need to talk about this."
"115740052-0-40121";"Uh, I'll climb up to the folk on those trellises. You get the ones on the ground. Let's hurry!"
"115740052-0-40122";"I admit, it's quite a story, but I know the difference between a tall tale and a large problem. I'll help however I can."
"115740052-0-40123";"I shudder to think what your Elven circus would consider far-fetched. I'm not so sure I believe it myself …."
"115740052-0-40124";"You found his helm? We're off to a great start! Unless …. Come here a moment."
"115740052-0-40126";"Find my armor and break the curse. Your friend will be safe with me in the meantime."
"115740052-0-40127";"Lady Yisara? I had not expected to see you again. Why do you summon me?"
"115740052-0-40128";"Lady Yisara, you bear not only Alizinda's ring, but her spirit as well. Had I a heart, it would pound like a drum at the sight of you."
"115740052-0-40129";"I, uhm … thank you, Mathen. I'm sorry for what happened to you. My friend and I will fix it, I promise."
"115740052-0-40130";"Think that's all of them! Let me climb down, I got something to tell you!"
"115740052-0-40131";"Having you beside me is all I need. Come, let me sweep you away."
"115740052-0-40132";"Ah, the mercenary. A few moment's later and you would have found an empty cave."
"115740052-0-40133";"By Vehk, Bevene really found someone to help. Thank you, stranger."
"115740052-0-40134";"There you go! Follow your friend down there and get out of here!"
"115740052-0-40136";"Wish I could have saved some for my own head. Uh, I'm just going to have a sit down over here."
"115740052-0-40137";"Whew, that salve's like Red Mountain in my veins. I—I've got it from here."
"115740052-0-40138";"The skull must be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-40139";"Mathen, my darling boy! We can finally end this curse!"
"115740052-0-40140";"And now I part with the Lady Yisara as well? Is there nothing you won't take from me?"
"115740052-0-40141";"Place the regalia, adventurer. It is well past time we left."
"115740052-0-40142";"I'm … I'm still here?"
"115740052-0-40143";"My poor Mathen! What went wrong?"
"115740052-0-40144";"Lady Yisara, light of my … afterlife. That ring you carry is the key to my heart. I leave my fate in your hands."
"115740052-0-40145";"My hands? Mathen, what are you saying?"
"115740052-0-40146";"If you choose to wear the ring, I will remain by your side—an attentive and loving guardian."
"115740052-0-40147";"Are you serious? Tall Papa preserve me …."
"115740052-0-40148";"I understand. Yours is a loving heart, Yisara. I pray you find someone worthy to share it with."
"115740052-0-40153";"I wonder what adventures this tiny sword has seen."
"115740052-0-40154";"A list of departures. Annyce had a mind to travel."
"115740052-0-40155";"Seems our pirate raided the pantry before she left. She planned to be gone a while."
"115740052-0-40156";"Despite the smell I don't think that's a funerary urn. The ashes are too fresh."
"115740052-0-40157";"I was attacked in the streets of our fair city, Keshu! I demand you deal with the criminal post haste!"
"115740052-0-40158";"There are bits of paper in this brazier, but most of these books are too soggy for tinder."
"115740052-0-40159";"This book is well worn, but hardly old. Given the subject matter, I'd wager it belonged to Annyce."
"115740052-0-40160";"Your guards did their job, Councilor Vandacia. The prisoner is secure."
"115740052-0-40161";"And what's this? More assassins? Explain yourself, immediately!"
"115740052-0-40165";"Well, this is troubling."
"115740052-0-40166";"Ah, little mortals. Come, speak to me."
"115740052-0-40167";"Intruders! Stop them, my brethren!"
"115740052-0-40168";"The cell door is open? What happened here?"
"115740052-0-40169";"Drathas, you performed adequately. I'm impressed."
"115740052-0-40170";"Huh. You actually praised me."
"115740052-0-40171";"What a charming little fort. Well cared for. Loved. Annyce's home away from home. We should look around."
"115740052-0-40173";"The tracks lead to this ruin. Did Annyce come here seeking adventure? We should look around."
"115740052-0-40174";"What did Zaudrus want with you?"
"115740052-0-40175";"Annyce? Everything all right?"
"115740052-0-40176";"You—your mother's looked all over for you. Where've you been?"
"115740052-0-40177";"Ugh, I ran away again. All right? Just be glad I came back at all."
"115740052-0-40178";"Some sort of acid. Ate right through the lock. Look, there's more of it on the floor."
"115740052-0-40179";"He said very little. But such machines are used to extract Daedric power. I assume for use in their ritual."
"115740052-0-40181";"Ahem, I hate to interrupt, but …."
"115740052-0-40182";"May we have a word? In private?"
"115740052-0-40183";"I concur."
"115740052-0-40184";"We must stop Baron Zaudrus and find my father. He's close. I can feel it."
"115740052-0-40185";"This looks right. After you, adventurers first."
"115740052-0-40186";"Stand back, ye wee swab! Ye cannot board this vessel until you have satisfied me, the Mighty Flicka!"
"115740052-0-40187";"Look out she's … Mighty Flicka? From the Saga of Captain Wereshark? That, I did not expect."
"115740052-0-40188";"Will the sea swallow you like so many others?"
"115740052-0-40189";"Think you have what it takes to join the Wereshark's crew? Ha! I doubt it."
"115740052-0-40191";"Your performance could have used more verve, but it seems the guardians aren't judging on enthusiasm. Let's head inside."
"115740052-0-40193";"Auri-El above! It's Annyce—and all the others! They appear to be alive. Let's try waking them."
"115740052-0-40194";"Dare ye cross sabers with Red Annyce? Ha!"
"115740052-0-40195";"Oh darling, that's lovely."
"115740052-0-40196";"Gold! So much gold!"
"115740052-0-40197";"Yes! Bring Bugtail more sweetrolls!"
"115740052-0-40198";"It's a dream. They're all dreaming."
"115740052-0-40199";"Oh, don't give me that look. You only have yourself to blame."
"115740052-0-40200";"When you're ready, place a hand on Annyce's forehead and start counting sails."
"115740052-0-40201";"This pool looks humble and inviting. Get in there and scrub my brother."
"115740052-0-40202";"There are multiple pools scattered throughout the ruins. I suggest we bathe Deet-Loh in three different pools. That should show the Nereid he's sorry."
"115740052-0-40203";"Deet-Loh's himself again. Let's get out of here before the Nereid changes her mind and turns him into a torchbug or something."
"115740052-0-40204";"All right Deet-Loh, this pool looks appropriately remorseful. Go ahead and soap him up, please."
"115740052-0-40205";"Now this pools simply screams penance. Try cleaning behind his ears this time."
"115740052-0-40206";"Just splash some water on Deet-Loh. He always sings in the bath."
"115740052-0-40207";"This is the place. Take my brother into the water and get him to sing!"
"115740052-0-40209";"Thank you, stranger."
"115740052-0-40211";"You're persistent, I'll give you that. All right, let's chat."
"115740052-0-40212";"Tempting, but no. I detest so-called places of justice."
"115740052-0-40213";"The Dark Brotherhood. They must be driven out of Blackwood."
"115740052-0-40214";"I still can't figure out why they would be targeting us, Vandacia."
"115740052-0-40215";"Eliminate the threat first. Then we can seek answers."
"115740052-0-40216";"Farewell, Captain …."
"115740052-0-40217";"No! He promised!"
"115740052-0-40218";"My gold!"
"115740052-0-40219";"My sweetrolls!"
"115740052-0-40220";"You defile the sanctity of this site! I must find another."
"115740052-0-40221";"I know what you seek, Lyranth. Come find me if you wish."
"115740052-0-40222";"Hey! You! Have you seen Annyce?"
"115740052-0-40223";"Or they could just knock down the wall. Sure. The Painted Eye must already be inside."
"115740052-0-40224";"The ward has fallen. Let us see what waits inside."
"115740052-0-40225";"I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back …."
"115740052-0-40226";"Let's get looking. The entrance is in one of the tombs, right?"
"115740052-0-40227";"Coward! He couldn't have gotten far."
"115740052-0-40228";"Enough of this charade, Cres. Off with your false face."
"115740052-0-40229";"You're … a Daedra?"
"115740052-0-40230";"All these people. I knew them. My friends, neighbors."
"115740052-0-40231";"What are you—ah!"
"115740052-0-40232";"I sense more wards ahead. Deal with them. I shall wait here."
"115740052-0-40233";"Drathas … son, is that you?"
"115740052-0-40235";"Father! You're alive! I'm here now."
"115740052-0-40236";"How are you here? Who are these people?"
"115740052-0-40237";"Every moment we wait, we lose time. I fulfilled my end, Drathas. I must get that lockbox."
"115740052-0-40238";"Friend, I must stay with my father. Finish the deal. Find Baron Zaudrus and get the lockbox."
"115740052-0-40239";"One more step and you get an arrow in the knee! Hey, you don't look like a cultist."
"115740052-0-40240";"You dare return, little pig? To frighten more of my beloved frogs? Very well. What happens next is on your head!"
"115740052-0-40241";"Running like a coward! Let's move. He couldn't have gotten far."
"115740052-0-40242";"Hand the map to me, creature! Or die protecting it."
"115740052-0-40243";"What you want is right here, Lyranth. Come take it."
"115740052-0-40244";"No! I almost have it! Stop them!"
"115740052-0-40245";"I won't let this power escape me! I won't!"
"115740052-0-40246";"Nearly … there!"
"115740052-0-40247";"Seems we've struck a nerve. Let's keep it up."
"115740052-0-40248";"I don't see that looney coming to stop us. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-40249";"Gods, I hope that did it. One way to find out."
"115740052-0-40251";"Get to safety, Kuran. We will find the others."
"115740052-0-40252";"I'll meet you at Bloodrun Cave!"
"115740052-0-40253";"You made the right call, Lovidicus. We won't be safe until the Dark Brotherhood is driven out of Blackwood."
"115740052-0-40254";"Good. The Sul-Xan will not have her."
"115740052-0-40257";"Don't worry, raj-beeko. We will."
"115740052-0-40258";"That is the last one. Let's speak, beek-ojel."
"115740052-0-40259";"Glad you made it. I wasn't looking forward to going much deeper without you."
"115740052-0-40261";"You killed him. The monster responsible for all this suffering. It's over."
"115740052-0-40262";"Drathas has his father. Now you must complete the deal. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-40264";"This looks promising. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-40265";"I am proud of you Drathas. I thought for sure my death was near. Never did I imagine you capable of such strength."
"115740052-0-40266";"Thank you, father. My friends helped me more than I can say."
"115740052-0-40267";"A touching reunion indeed. But you must fulfill the bargain, Drathas."
"115740052-0-40268";"We must recover the Daedric weapons, pedagogue! Bring me the contents of that cache as soon as you have them."
"115740052-0-40269";"You call this humble? If a pig doesn't suit him, how about a fowl?"
"115740052-0-40270";"Is that a look of remorse? I think not! But if a chicken isn't to your liking, how about a tiny lizard?"
"115740052-0-40271";"This frog-frightener muddies my pools and thinks that will earn my forgiveness? After he scared away my beloved croakers? Never!"
"115740052-0-40272";"Lower your weapon, Elf. I'll confer with the other mortal after they search the cache."
"115740052-0-40273";"Hang on, let me try …."
"115740052-0-40274";"Hey, that actually worked! Look out—Daedra!"
"115740052-0-40275";"Oh, great water spirit. See how my brother grovels. Can you remove his porkish nature now, please?"
"115740052-0-40276";"Oh powerful Nereid, hear our sorrow. Make Deet-Loh no longer a chicken, please?"
"115740052-0-40277";"Come on, water lady. We're sorry already! Please change my brother back."
"115740052-0-40278";"My beautiful frogs! They've come home!"
"115740052-0-40279";"<<Croak! Ribbet! Croak, croak!>>"
"115740052-0-40281";"No more frogs, brother! Time to find a different instrument, I think."
"115740052-0-40282";"What did you find? Anything interesting in there?"
"115740052-0-40283";"This portal shall take you to Elden Root. Do not dally. I sense there's more to this mystery than the politics of emperors."
"115740052-0-40284";"Friend, meet Beragon. Beragon, this is my friend. We've got a scroll to show you."
"115740052-0-40285";"Vandacia's cultists have arrived! We need a plan."
"115740052-0-40287";"I'd like you to accompany me to the Resolutions of Zenithar, Gavos. Your story is one we should all hear."
"115740052-0-40289";"Argonians and Imperials. It looks like they were fighting back to back, defending themselves. Their wounds are jagged, too."
"115740052-0-40290";"These ancient totems are spread out across the swamp, but they are always dormant. Strange."
"115740052-0-40291";"We use this dye for rituals. Is this what woke those totems? Let us follow the footprints."
"115740052-0-40292";"If this old man still has use left in him, it's Zenithar's to command."
"115740052-0-40293";"Stay back! I'm warning you …."
"115740052-0-40294";"Destron, what should we do?"
"115740052-0-40295";"Exactly what we were trained to do!"
"115740052-0-40296";"Go ahead. See if that pass phrase opens the creepy black door."
"115740052-0-40297";"Still looking for your murderer? Well, you've come to the wrong place, my friends."
"115740052-0-40298";"We found the black hands beside every body!"
"115740052-0-40299";"Must I say it again? You've been duped! And the Dark Brotherhood has been set up to take the blame."
"115740052-0-40301";"Now what?"
"115740052-0-40302";"Fine work! Come on—I'll meet you just past that door."
"115740052-0-40303";"Cultists, portaling in! Quickly, secure the sanctuary!"
"115740052-0-40304";"Arise, Qrazgoth! Destroy those who would defy Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40305";"That's the Order of the Waking Flame! What are they doing here? Come on, we need to figure out what's going on."
"115740052-0-40306";"This can't be a coincidence. Did the Waking Flame cultists follow us here?"
"115740052-0-40307";"The letters mentioned the three trade-ministers. Now that we have the directory, it should lead us right to their holdings."
"115740052-0-40308";"Lord Dagon, Prince of Destruction, lend us your strength!"
"115740052-0-40309";"Oh, I think not."
"115740052-0-40310";"Just the sort of place Goblins love—darksome, dank, and foul."
"115740052-0-40311";"There must have been little trust between the trade-ministers for them all to have hidden their sigil keys from each other."
"115740052-0-40312";"Stay with the assassin! I'll inform Captain Rian and Councilor Lovidicus about the cultists!"
"115740052-0-40313";"<Horn Blows>"
"115740052-0-40314";"Did you hear that? Phalevon's horn!"
"115740052-0-40315";"An Ayleid ruin? Not the worst place for a Daedric cult to hide out. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-40317";"Hmm. Some of the buildings and stalls seem intact. Let's start there."
"115740052-0-40318";"Looks like I'm not the only one who leaves important papers lying about. Give that a read, why don't you."
"115740052-0-40319";"That amulet looks important. Better hang onto that."
"115740052-0-40320";"A close approximation of our calling card, but that entire pile is obviously a forgery."
"115740052-0-40321";"Over here. Voices."
"115740052-0-40322";"We failed to kill all the assassins. And the Wood Elf and the mercenary are still alive."
"115740052-0-40323";"Yes, the high priest isn't going to be happy about that, but we retrieved the cache hidden in the old sanctuary."
"115740052-0-40324";"With the contents of the cache, the high priest should be able to determine where to find the first Ambition."
"115740052-0-40325";"Agreed. And we will soon have the location of another one of the Ambitions. As just another Imperial councilor, the high priest has them all fooled!"
"115740052-0-40327";"You hurt Qrazgoth? Then face me directly, unbelievers!"
"115740052-0-40328";"Now that's something new. What do you think?"
"115740052-0-40329";"That pedestal looks promising. Let's talk before you try to open a portal."
"115740052-0-40330";"See if you can use that rather ostentatious amulet on the pedestal to open a portal."
"115740052-0-40331";"Well, we have a portal. Now to find out if leaping into it turns out to be a good or bad idea."
"115740052-0-40333";"That's all three sigils! We can unseal the adytum! It will be within the abbey's temple."
"115740052-0-40334";"You have earned that much and more. I'll get the door for you."
"115740052-0-40336";"Wait a moment, stranger! I need to speak with you."
"115740052-0-40337";"We're too late. The location of the Ambition was sent to the high priest. But what was that about an attack on Leyawiin Castle?"
"115740052-0-40339";"Steady. Wait for it …."
"115740052-0-40343";"I will finish what the Longhouse Emperors started, Lovidicus. I will set loose the power of the Four Ambitions!"
"115740052-0-40344";"Don't worry about me. Deal with that creature!"
"115740052-0-40345";"Lord Dagon, hear your high priest! Send forth a champion to destroy these meddlers!"
"115740052-0-40346";"Vandacia will pay. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-40347";"Councilor Lovidicus, you need to rest."
"115740052-0-40348";"Vandacia is the order's high priest? I knew I disliked the man the moment he had me beaten!"
"115740052-0-40349";"Ah, giant one! The Duke of Crows requests your help!"
"115740052-0-40350";"Enough! This feeble prison can no longer hold me!"
"115740052-0-40351";"Not another word."
"115740052-0-40352";"We must free my friends to disrupt the rituals! Let us make haste!"
"115740052-0-40353";"There, my knight! There! Destroy the mirror of lies!"
"115740052-0-40354";"Fly, fly! Still more remain. Let us be swift!"
"115740052-0-40355";"Don't push it."
"115740052-0-40356";"I'm sorry Cres, even if you mean no harm, you are the cause of it."
"115740052-0-40357";"I'm sorry if I hurt those people. I hope they recover."
"115740052-0-40358";"Please tell them I was glad to know the—"
"115740052-0-40359";"The Daedra is gone. Though the rifts they caused will remain for some time."
"115740052-0-40360";"Head for Renna's house. I'll be right behind you!"
"115740052-0-40361";"All right, Cres. I have a deal for you."
"115740052-0-40362";"You do? Does this mean I can stay?"
"115740052-0-40363";"No. Not in Farmer's Nook anyway."
"115740052-0-40364";"Oh … does it mean I don't have to go back to the library?"
"115740052-0-40365";"Yes, and you will get to live a great many incredible lives."
"115740052-0-40366";"I can? What do you need me to do?"
"115740052-0-40367";"Watch, and learn. You're going to be my apprentice. Now, let's get you a mask."
"115740052-0-40368";"More of the Blackfeather Court. Smash the mirror, crow-friend!"
"115740052-0-40369";"Take wing, my knights! Turn your keen eyes from the shinies!"
"115740052-0-40371";"Freedom! Vengeance! Come, there are still more to rescue!"
"115740052-0-40372";"Fools! Fear our magnificence!"
"115740052-0-40373";"Free us, crow-friend! Free us!"
"115740052-0-40374";"Victory! Triumph! Let us speak outside, my beakless warrior!"
"115740052-0-40375";"I will meet you back at the village."
"115740052-0-40376";"Join us, crow-friend!"
"115740052-0-40377";"The idol! It's already absorbing spirits!"
"115740052-0-40378";"Hurry. They must be performing more rituals further inside."
"115740052-0-40379";"Help … help me …."
"115740052-0-40380";"That doesn't sound good. Hurry, let's get inside!"
"115740052-0-40381";"Oh, you hear that? Tree's finally speaking clearly!"
"115740052-0-40382";"Oh, Renna. I'm so sorry."
"115740052-0-40383";"Keep your fins and eyes sharp, friend. We are close."
"115740052-0-40384";"Oh, it is quite dark in here. Why don't you lead?"
"115740052-0-40385";"Come on, let's talk outside. I'll meet you out back, under the dock."
"115740052-0-40386";"You have my word. If the councilor is in Leyawiin or the surrounding countryside, the Ivory Brigade will find her."
"115740052-0-40387";"You bring a stranger to my home, Nuxul?"
"115740052-0-40388";"Who brings me forth after an eternity?"
"115740052-0-40389";"You accept my might … but are you worthy of it?"
"115740052-0-40390";"The circle is complete. Your final test awaits."
"115740052-0-40391";"Through your wisdom, you have earned the right to challenge me. I shall not go easy."
"115740052-0-40392";"That's one. True warriors stand again rather than stay on the ground."
"115740052-0-40393";"Now two battles lost. Will you seek redemption for your failure?"
"115740052-0-40394";"Three failures. I begin to fear I shall not find release this day."
"115740052-0-40395";"Four. I offer a final chance, mortals. Please—do not make me regret this."
"115740052-0-40396";"Enough. I rescind my offer of power. Perhaps we will meet again when you are ready."
"115740052-0-40397";"Your damn Empire, Lovidicus. It no longer exists but it still causes us trouble."
"115740052-0-40399";"Get those doors open! We need to get to the councilors!"
"115740052-0-40400";"They're barred from the other side!"
"115740052-0-40401";"Mercenary, you've returned! Eveli's attempting to breach the barracks. Go!"
"115740052-0-40403";"Now we can go in! Let's— oh, you're here!"
"115740052-0-40404";"That must be the first obelisk!"
"115740052-0-40405";"Prepare yourself, brother, while our friend activates it and serves as our witness."
"115740052-0-40406";"The babes are asleep? How? I couldn't get the boy to stop bawling."
"115740052-0-40407";"I fed the twins until they were full and exhausted."
"115740052-0-40408";"Your majesty! Welcome. The babes are healthy and strong."
"115740052-0-40413";"As commanded, my emperor, she bore twins."
"115740052-0-40414";"Our parents and the high priest? I don't understand."
"115740052-0-40415";"Something's happening!"
"115740052-0-40417";"Proceed, high priest."
"115740052-0-40418";"O Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Ambition and Destruction, imbue these infants with your power!"
"115740052-0-40420";"Let it ripen and grow within these vessels until the appointed time!"
"115740052-0-40422";"<Babies wailing in distress>"
"115740052-0-40423";"Our parents were sacrificed to Mehrunes Dagon? Why?"
"115740052-0-40424";"I'm sure I heard the horn in this chamber. But who sounded it?"
"115740052-0-40426";"Velan, no!"
"115740052-0-40427";"Tiras! And more clouded varla stones. By the Three, were the Ayleids selling them wholesale?"
"115740052-0-40428";"I suppose this is the Obelisk of Empowerment."
"115740052-0-40429";"Activate it, if you would, friend."
"115740052-0-40430";"It's starting."
"115740052-0-40431";"That portal opened on its own. I suppose we should step inside."
"115740052-0-40432";"Ugh … that is awful! What … who are you?"
"115740052-0-40433";"Join me inside. We will see what you're made of."
"115740052-0-40434";"Look! They have captives!"
"115740052-0-40435";"Speak with me, mortal."
"115740052-0-40436";"This wasn't how it was supposed to turn out. Come on, let's go after them."
"115740052-0-40437";"Farewell, dear lady. I wish we had more time."
"115740052-0-40438";"Mathen! Why aren't you—? Mathen!"
"115740052-0-40439";"Drathas? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-40440";"I came to find my father and my uncle. Have you seen them?"
"115740052-0-40441";"Those cultists took them both ahead. Nobody who has gone farther in has come back. Be careful!"
"115740052-0-40442";"Hold your end of the bargain, Lyranth. Make sure they get out safe."
"115740052-0-40443";"Ack! What is this?"
"115740052-0-40444";"Gods, what is that?"
"115740052-0-40445";"Eek! What is this stuff?"
"115740052-0-40446";"Ha! Oh, by the gods. That one got me good! Well done!"
"115740052-0-40447";"Everyone, I swear it wasn't me! It's a trick, and a damned good one at that!"
"115740052-0-40448";"Oh ho! This has Soars-in-Laughter written all over it! Ha!"
"115740052-0-40449";"Hello there! Are you looking for a particular book?"
"115740052-0-40450";"Ah, that seat's taken, friend."
"115740052-0-40451";"Hello! Perhaps I could help you find something?"
"115740052-0-40452";"Once you turn the crank, I can reach the other and the cells should unlock."
"115740052-0-40453";"We're free! I never thought to see the day. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-40454";"You … are worthy. At last … I am free."
"115740052-0-40455";"Yes, of course. One moment."
"115740052-0-40456";"Ah ha! Easy enough."
"115740052-0-40457";"Here you are. Seems to be a map?"
"115740052-0-40458";"Adequate work. I hope our paths never cross again."
"115740052-0-40459";"The test intensifies. Go beyond your limits."
"115740052-0-40460";"This does not end until I am satisfied!"
"115740052-0-40461";"An end approaches, but whose?"
"115740052-0-40462";"Tiras … he's not gone after all?"
"115740052-0-40463";"I will not fail my lord and prince!"
"115740052-0-40464";"Oh, I haven't seen this book before."
"115740052-0-40465";"Perhaps there, near that overturned slab?"
"115740052-0-40466";"Fall back! Close the portals! Warn the high priest!"
"115740052-0-40467";"All right, what were we discussing before they so rudely interrupted us?"
"115740052-0-40468";"Now, the last sequence!"
"115740052-0-40469";"Good! Now here comes the next sequence!"
"115740052-0-40470";"Like I said before, pay careful attention to the flow of energy. Find the pylon that isn't properly attuned!"
"115740052-0-40472";"If you're quite finished, Revus? Hmm. An artless configuration, to be sure."
"115740052-0-40473";"Balancing the crystal resonance is simple enough …."
"115740052-0-40474";"There. A perfect calibration. Much good may it do you."
"115740052-0-40476";"With no porters? No assistants? This endeavor's been a farce from the start, Revus. Now, it's a doomed one."
"115740052-0-40477";"Of all the rotten luck …."
"115740052-0-40478";"Taking assistance from random passersby? The magisters of the House will most certainly have opinions on this."
"115740052-0-40479";"Come to think of it, Revus, a crumbling ruin is an apt place for your final experiment with House Telvanni."
"115740052-0-40480";"Let's make our way to this private study. Carefully!"
"115740052-0-40481";"The cultists … they destroyed the ward and marched right in …."
"115740052-0-40483";"His own mother, toying with dark magic, in this very room. What a plot twist!"
"115740052-0-40484";"You found something?"
"115740052-0-40485";"I saw a clump of heartsbane on the way here. Come on!"
"115740052-0-40486";"Our maps of Veyond didn't depict this tunnel. Vehk's head. Be on your guard."
"115740052-0-40487";"Trolls? Hideous, savage beast! Keep that brute away from me!"
"115740052-0-40488";"There, in the distance—more Ayleid masonry. Finally, no more mucking around the dirt like some clumsy saltrice farmer."
"115740052-0-40489";"There's a strange aura on the other side of this door. Can you feel it? What am I saying? Of course you can't."
"115740052-0-40490";"This way! I think."
"115740052-0-40491";"There. That's heartsbane, right?"
"115740052-0-40492";"Bevene! Where have you been? We thought you'd be waiting for us, but …!"
"115740052-0-40493";"I didn't think I'd see either of you again. I almost didn't. We have that little Wood Elf and his friend for that."
"115740052-0-40494";"Their high priest actually ordered them to kill us!"
"115740052-0-40495";"This door looks impressive. Let's see what's on the other side."
"115740052-0-40496";"Mathen? What did you do?"
"115740052-0-40497";"Keep looking. We need to find a pedestal like the one those cultists used."
"115740052-0-40498";"Well, this is interesting. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-40500";"Let disaster rain upon you, fool!"
"115740052-0-40501";"Mages! Stay close, I can block their spells!"
"115740052-0-40502";"Where—where are the others? The ones who sent you? Was there a Dunmer woman among them?"
"115740052-0-40503";"I—uh … I tried to save her, but her wounds … I couldn't. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-40504";"No … Bevene …."
"115740052-0-40505";"What's taking you so long? They should—"
"115740052-0-40506";"You have nothing to fear, lovely Yisara. I only hoped to spend another moment with you. I mean no harm. You are so like Alizinda …."
"115740052-0-40507";"I'm … I'm flattered. But I'm not Alizinda. I'm barely anyone!"
"115740052-0-40508";"Oh, my lady. You do yourself no credit! You are brave, clever, and all too beautiful. Stay with me for just a few moments more."
"115740052-0-40509";"My lost Alizinda … I never met anyone so driven by their passions. She loved deeply. Recklessly. Her anguished face still haunts me."
"115740052-0-40510";"But she murdered you. You don't blame her for that?"
"115740052-0-40511";"I forgave her instantly. She was misled. I only regret that I couldn't save her from that pain."
"115740052-0-40512";"Well, Mathen, I know that's tragic, but it's also the most romantic thing I have ever heard."
"115740052-0-40516";"You summon me again? Did you find the armor?"
"115740052-0-40517";"I don't want that woman lingering near my son any more than you do. Find the sword and bring it to the tower!"
"115740052-0-40518";"Ugh. I'll probably regret this, but I'll try to attune the stones. You push them out of position. Maybe that will set him free."
"115740052-0-40519";"The base camp should be—Eolaf! What are those fetchers doing to him?"
"115740052-0-40520";"The others are inside. I will show you!"
"115740052-0-40521";"No! Not … enough!"
"115740052-0-40522";"I know that did not look like a success … but I think I know what's happening."
"115740052-0-40524";"I think I know what's going on!"
"115740052-0-40525";"The foul cultists gather here. Fight! Win! For the Court!"
"115740052-0-40526";"Music"
"115740052-0-40527";"I want you to stay with me, Mathen. I know it's weird, but—"
"115740052-0-40528";"I want you to stay, Mathen. I really do. But it wouldn't be fair to you or Alizinda. Our friend will destroy the ring."
"115740052-0-40529";"That's … not our sky. It wasn't like this before. We should hurry."
"115740052-0-40530";"Weird? No, my lady. Unique. Unique and perfect."
"115740052-0-40531";"Ayem's mercy, Tiras is fading faster! Quickly, just smash these stones and we'll hope for the best!"
"115740052-0-40532";"There! Now, use the censer. We have to find the central lode!"
"115740052-0-40533";"What took you so long?"
"115740052-0-40534";"All right, I'm placing the book as Lyranth suggested. You check out those cubes."
"115740052-0-40535";"I'm alive! Thank you! Ayem's mercy, I thought I was dead!"
"115740052-0-40536";"Time to move. Stay close!"
"115740052-0-40537";"There's more coming. All of you, under the shield!"
"115740052-0-40538";"Look at this pedestal, it appears the Mysterium Xarxes would fit perfectly. Perhaps that is the key to unlocking the vault!"
"115740052-0-40539";"Hey! That did something!"
"115740052-0-40540";"I think you did it! Let's check the door!"
"115740052-0-40541";"That matches one of these symbols. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-40543";"The foliage is real restless around here. And loud."
"115740052-0-40544";"Hold on there! Look at this vine."
"115740052-0-40546";"That's definitely a harrada creeper vine! Now if only we can find its roots. Must be around here somewhere!"
"115740052-0-40548";"More harrada vines! Try pulling them up!"
"115740052-0-40549";"Huh. Nope. Still no roots. This creeper's done quite some creeping. Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-40551";"Here we go. Get it by the base and give a good pull!"
"115740052-0-40552";"Still no roots. Hey, it's quieted down quite a bit out here."
"115740052-0-40553";"Over here …!"
"115740052-0-40554";"Oh, wait. It's a person!"
"115740052-0-40555";"Oh! That's, uh … very generous, Tiras. Thank you."
"115740052-0-40556";"You, my giant, are unstoppable! Such smashing! Such crushing!"
"115740052-0-40557";"There are still others trapped. Do not let the cultists open their doors!"
"115740052-0-40558";"There! Members of the Court! Break the mirror and free them!"
"115740052-0-40559";"Crow-friend! The Duke wishes to speak with you!"
"115740052-0-40560";"Definitely not smugglers. Too many skulls."
"115740052-0-40561";"Did mother send you? I can't wait to see her again."
"115740052-0-40562";"Thank the Divines! I thought I'd die down here."
"115740052-0-40563";"Hey, friend! Over here!"
"115740052-0-40564";"Over here! The cultists tricky shinies. Come closer, but be cautious."
"115740052-0-40570";"And another, now just one more!"
"115740052-0-40571";"Look at this place!"
"115740052-0-40572";"You go no further!"
"115740052-0-40575";"You matched the second symbol!"
"115740052-0-40576";"That did something! Keep going!"
"115740052-0-40577";"The ward is down, excellent! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-40580";"Now where are we? Never mind. We need to lower that drawbridge."
"115740052-0-40581";"That did it! Now we can get across!"
"115740052-0-40586";"Another ward, damn. I'll place the book, you turn the cubes."
"115740052-0-40587";"That did something!"
"115740052-0-40588";"Good job, keep going!"
"115740052-0-40589";"That looks right. I wonder what they mean?"
"115740052-0-40590";"Daedric symbols give me the shivers, but I think it's working!"
"115740052-0-40591";"The ward's down! You did it! Now, let's see what's so important it needed all this protection."
"115740052-0-40592";"Ah, I was wondering where you had gotten to. I need you once again."
"115740052-0-40593";"You have done well so far, mercenary. Now we must speak."
"115740052-0-40594";"If you're here to help, please hurry."
"115740052-0-40595";"Bevene, is that you?"
"115740052-0-40596";"Don't feed me to—wait you're not one of these marauders."
"115740052-0-40597";"As Mehrunes Dagon commanded, so it has been done."
"115740052-0-40598";"So these are the Imperial sewers? Fancy!"
"115740052-0-40599";"So let it be done."
"115740052-0-40600";"As Dagon wills it."
"115740052-0-40601";"Looks like the Order of the Waking Flame got here first, damn!"
"115740052-0-40602";"The ward's down. The cultists must be inside!"
"115740052-0-40603";"Go slow. Let's not alert the cultists until absolutely necessary."
"115740052-0-40604";"Look! A cache. And it's still warded!"
"115740052-0-40605";"The Longhouse Emperors really did it! They made a deal with Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40606";"Emperor Leovic wrote that! But it's not in code. If those councilors know the secret, their lives are in danger!"
"115740052-0-40607";"The cult's trying to contact Mehrunes Dagon! Let's find that shrine!"
"115740052-0-40608";"I don't believe it … is this really … Oblivion?"
"115740052-0-40609";"Why do you think he named this place the Deadlands? Looks more like the Really Hot Lands to me."
"115740052-0-40610";"My arrows will make short work of the cultist … but I'm not too sure about Mehrunes Dagon."
"115740052-0-40611";"The Ambitions must be some sort of weapons. We can't let them fall into the hands of this cult."
"115740052-0-40613";"People? Where are the Daedric weapons?"
"115740052-0-40614";"Who are these intruders?"
"115740052-0-40615";"I sense the cultists. They're close. Wood Elf, check the other side of those doors."
"115740052-0-40616";"Careful, brother. They look dangerous."
"115740052-0-40617";"A dock, an abandoned shack, a cave by the water … looks like a smuggler's den to me."
"115740052-0-40618";"Those roots! It looks like there's another passage beyond."
"115740052-0-40619";"I want to confront a cultist and see if we can get some information."
"115740052-0-40620";"To walk upon the sacred sands of the Deadlands? You honor me, Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40621";"Hurry, we need to reach the councilors!"
"115740052-0-40622";"I gave the mortals everything they requested, and yet we come to this."
"115740052-0-40623";"I have invested a significant amount of effort into the Four Ambitions."
"115740052-0-40624";"And yet the Ambitions have been misplaced and the bargain struck remains unfulfilled."
"115740052-0-40625";"Your acolyte, the leader of our order. He sent me to find the Four Ambitions, Lord Dagon."
"115740052-0-40626";"You bested my follower, mortals, so I shall permit you to leave my realm with your lives. Step through the portal and begone!"
"115740052-0-40627";"The leader of the Waking Flame sent me to finish what the Black Drake started."
"115740052-0-40628";"Then command me, Lord Dagon! I shall do whatever you ask!"
"115740052-0-40629";"I should have stayed home!"
"115740052-0-40630";"Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-40631";"You all are on your own!"
"115740052-0-40632";"I'm not really with them! Don't hurt me!"
"115740052-0-40633";"You there! Stop!"
"115740052-0-40634";"Vandacia, how could you?"
"115740052-0-40635";"Faleria, with everything at stake, how could I not?"
"115740052-0-40636";"Another sacrifice for Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40637";"These treasures belong to the Order of the Waking Flame!"
"115740052-0-40638";"Blood for Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40639";"Please hurry! Break the ritual stones. They're burning me!"
"115740052-0-40640";"You're awake? Thank the stars."
"115740052-0-40641";"Wise choice. Just give me a moment."
"115740052-0-40642";"There. That should unlock the door."
"115740052-0-40643";"When you're ready, follow me."
"115740052-0-40644";"Yes, I think that one suits you. If you change your mind, feel free to take any other weapon you want. Now, let's find a spot to practice."
"115740052-0-40645";"This is as good a place as any. Now, prepare yourself …."
"115740052-0-40646";"While I conjure up a dance partner."
"115740052-0-40647";"Well done! Come speak with me for a moment."
"115740052-0-40648";"Well, this is upsetting."
"115740052-0-40649";"All right, moment of truth. Focus on the skyshard aperture. With any luck, it'll respond to the power you absorbed and unlock the gate."
"115740052-0-40650";"Ha! You did it! Let's speak for a moment."
"115740052-0-40651";"The Keywright's Gallery is in here. Let's head inside."
"115740052-0-40652";"Right. The entrance to the Keywright's Gallery should be east of here. Let's set out."
"115740052-0-40653";"You did it! Hopefully the Gallery wasn't too badly damaged. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-40654";"Councilor Faleria, no!"
"115740052-0-40655";"Councilor Faleria. She's dead. We have to keep looking for Lovidicus."
"115740052-0-40656";"Councilor Lovidicus, you're alive!"
"115740052-0-40657";"Let me get you out of here and somewhere safe."
"115740052-0-40658";"This way, please! Mind where you step!"
"115740052-0-40659";"Welcome! This way to Councilor Vandacia's keep!"
"115740052-0-40660";"In the name of the Lord of Destruction, Councilor Vandacia bids you enter and make yourself at home."
"115740052-0-40661";"Keep going. Stay on the path!"
"115740052-0-40662";"Councilor Vandacia extends his welcome and bids you make your way to the audience hall."
"115740052-0-40663";"The audience hall is right through those doors."
"115740052-0-40664";"I'm sorry about Destron. Whatever you need, I'm here for you."
"115740052-0-40665";"He went out that window! Head around behind the house and let's cut him off!"
"115740052-0-40666";"I'm with you, my friend! We'll defeat Vandacia together!"
"115740052-0-40667";"My brigadines are here to help!"
"115740052-0-40670";"Well? What does the letter say?"
"115740052-0-40672";"The power of the Lord of Fire and Flood flows through me! You cannot stop what is happening!"
"115740052-0-40673";"What's that? Oh, feeling a bit better then? Don't mention it."
"115740052-0-40674";"Crowd Cheering"

"115740052-0-40694";"Well? Any luck, stranger?"
"115740052-0-40695";"I can picture our young heroine, wielding her imagination like a saber and cutting her way through all manner of adventure."
"115740052-0-40696";"I crave adventure and freedom. Play is my only escape."
"115740052-0-40697";"Music"
"115740052-0-40698";"I come here to plan. I fantasize about leaving. Doubt holds me back. I need someone to believe in me."
"115740052-0-40699";"So often, I'm alone, but today I have a visitor. Someone I trust. I go with them. I've never been more excited!"
"115740052-0-40700";"Once I get these Wood Elves out of here, I'll catch up with you!"
"115740052-0-40702";"You thought I wasn't prepared? Didn't you? Didn't you?"
"115740052-0-40703";"Thank you. Perhaps the friend you seek might still be alive."
"115740052-0-40704";"Hey, over here! You need to see this!"
"115740052-0-40705";"Here we go. Pray that a rude awakening is the worst they have to suffer."
"115740052-0-40706";"She would not."
"115740052-0-40707";"Mother?"
"115740052-0-40708";"I'm sorry …."
"115740052-0-40709";"If you wanted to be rid of me so bad, you could have sent a fake who did her chores."
"115740052-0-40710";"We will trust Maelle to see these people safely back to town. You and I should find Cres at once."
"115740052-0-40716";"This should take us right to the cult's hidden temple. Come on!"
"115740052-0-40717";"Hold up a moment, before we go on. I've been thinking."
"115740052-0-40718";"Someone's coming!"
"115740052-0-40719";"There you are! I'm afraid I wasted my time on that cultist—he knew nothing. Glad I caught up to you."
"115740052-0-40720";"Oh. I see you found that … that … Tenarei. Watch your back, friend."
"115740052-0-40721";"Look alive! The dead have come for us!"
"115740052-0-40722";"There it is! The skyshard!"
"115740052-0-40723";"We're off. Stibbonses, stay here. Understand? Stay!"
"115740052-0-40724";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-40726";"There's got to be a way through. I know what I saw on the map."
"115740052-0-40727";"Maybe the map showed a passage that isn't here?"
"115740052-0-40729";"Bah. I shall remember this."
"115740052-0-40730";"I'll keep out of your way if we run into more cultists. After that ritual I'm in no condition for a fight."
"115740052-0-40731";"But … I had the upper hand …."
"115740052-0-40732";"Well, that did something, but not what I was hoping for."
"115740052-0-40733";"There you are. I'm glad you managed to make that stone work."
"115740052-0-40734";"Search the vault for any sign of this machine. If you find anything, use the stone to contact me. Onsi guide you, comrade."
"115740052-0-40735";"I'll just … oh dear. I'll get out of the way!"
"115740052-0-40736";"Careful! Game wardens often set traps around here."
"115740052-0-40737";"What kind of proof would you need?"
"115740052-0-40738";"I'll need to bring Larz-Tul proof of Quistley's demise."
"115740052-0-40740";"That ring should work. It might even cover most of Quistley's debt."
"115740052-0-40741";"What do you think, Tenarei? Are you willing to give it a try?"
"115740052-0-40742";"Intruders? Get out! Get out!"
"115740052-0-40743";"Damn! I forgot how fragile mortals can be."
"115740052-0-40744";"The more of the area around that fort that slides into the Deadlands, the greater Dagon's influence will be!"
"115740052-0-40745";"Lord Dagon, I need more power!"
"115740052-0-40747";"You will not stop me! They are mine to control!"
"115740052-0-40748";"This way, mercenary! Up here!"
"115740052-0-40749";"Help him, help my son … succeed where his mother failed."
"115740052-0-40750";"There you are. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-40752";"This bag of meat and bones is mine! I shall be free!"
"115740052-0-40755";"These two will be safe here in Gideon, Eveli. You have my word."
"115740052-0-40756";"Thank you, governor."
"115740052-0-40757";"It sounds like these two have been through a lot, Eveli. I will personally see to it that they are well protected within Gideon's walls."
"115740052-0-40759";"Who dares walk the halls of the Sorcerer Rectavius?"
"115740052-0-40760";"You seek to stop my escape? Fool! You shall serve alongside the one who calls himself Stibbons!"
"115740052-0-40761";"Still you persist? And you use my own puppets against me? Such audacity will not go unpunished."
"115740052-0-40762";"What are you doing? Stop it right now and perhaps I'll let you live!"
"115740052-0-40763";"I'll catch up to you at the chapel, all right? I need to jot down some notes."
"115740052-0-40765";"Such beautiful music. What a lovely gift!"
"115740052-0-40766";"Sister of Pools forgives you, Deet-Loh! Be yourself once more! My frogs will sing your song for ages to come. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-40767";"Oh my! What is—? What just happened?"
"115740052-0-40769";"What? Did you just absorb the energy of that shard? Incredible. Not quite what I intended, but we can work with this. Let's head back to the gate."
"115740052-0-40770";"Councilor Jirich was assassinated, right under the nose of the brigadines!"
"115740052-0-40771";"I heard Captain Rian is at his wit's end. Even hired mercenaries. So much for the Ivory Brigade."
"115740052-0-40772";"What about the other former councilors? Do you think they're all in danger?"
"115740052-0-40773";"Who can say? But if the Dark Brotherhood is involved, what good are brigadines or mercenaries?"
"115740052-0-40774";"Did you hear? Cultists attacked Leyawiin Castle!"
"115740052-0-40775";"Yes, but the mercenaries stopped them. They saved Countess Caro and the Chamber of Legates!"
"115740052-0-40776";"One of the brigadines mentioned that Councilor Vandacia is a traitor. He killed Councilor Faleria!"
"115740052-0-40777";"No, that can't be true. Can it? Vandacia has served Blackwood for decades!"
"115740052-0-40778";"Those Waking Flame cultists, I hear they plan to attack Gideon next."
"115740052-0-40779";"Whatever for? Gideon is barely civilized. What could they hope to gain by attacking there?"
"115740052-0-40780";"How should I know? Do I look like a Daedric cultist?"
"115740052-0-40781";"Well, no one thought Vandacia was a cultist and look how that turned out. I just hope those mercenaries are still around."
"115740052-0-40782";"Did you hear? The mercenary and the cute Wood Elf archer led the defense of Fort Redmane!"
"115740052-0-40783";"So I heard! Brigadines and Black Fin Legionnaires, fighting together to defeat an army of Daedric cultists!"
"115740052-0-40784";"I have it on good authority that the mercenary killed Vandacia in a pitched battle."
"115740052-0-40785";"And someone told me that Mehrunes Dagon himself participated in the battle, but I don't believe a word of it!"
"115740052-0-40786";"Goodbye, Mathen."
"115740052-0-40788";"Well done, little mortal! Now I must explore!"
"115740052-0-40789";"Going somewhere? All right, I'll find you later."
"115740052-0-40790";"Be careful. I don't think they want us wandering around on our own."
"115740052-0-40791";"This portal will take you to Ne Salas. Raid the caches while I deal with the ensorcelled scroll."
"115740052-0-40792";"Looks like they caught Ardia after all. We need to free her!"
"115740052-0-40796";"I think I may stay here for a while, so that I—or rather, we—can get used to dealing with our curious partnership."
"115740052-0-40797";"Curious it may be, but I am not sure I was ever happier, even when I was flesh and bone."
"115740052-0-40798";"You all just get yourselves to safety. We'll handle the rest."
"115740052-0-40799";"He had shoulders as broad as the Jeralls …. Too much? Hmmm."
"115740052-0-40800";"Someone … anyone … help me!"
"115740052-0-40801";"Captain, are you really trusting the fate of Councilor Jirich to this … this outsider?"
"115740052-0-40802";"Oh, why didn't Councilor Jirich heed your warnings?"
"115740052-0-40803";"If the Ivory Brigade requires mercenaries to do their job, perhaps Leyawiin needs different protectors."
"115740052-0-40804";"All right. Do you see that vault to the south? The skyshard is there."
"115740052-0-40805";"We should hurry and go repair the gate."
"115740052-0-40806";"Yes, yes, my vision-dream speaks true! You are the one my mistress seeks!"
"115740052-0-40807";"Another portal? Don't Daedra have flying horses or something?"
"115740052-0-40808";"Enjoy yourselves! Councilor Vandacia shall be with you momentarily."
"115740052-0-40809";"See those wounds? My assassins did that! Then the cultists crawled back here to die. See if they're carrying anything important."
"115740052-0-40811";"Let's begin."
"115740052-0-40812";"This is it! And they've got Deejos!"
"115740052-0-40813";"Quickly now, strike the construct!"
"115740052-0-40814";"Whatever magic you turned on back there brought us some trouble!"
"115740052-0-40815";"I need … I need a moment …."
"115740052-0-40816";"Get up, Sombren! We need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-40817";"I can't … too exhausted …."
"115740052-0-40818";"I'll help Sombren! You need to deal with those Dremora!"
"115740052-0-40819";"Brilliant!"
"115740052-0-40820";"Ready yourself. Block its strikes!"
"115740052-0-40822";"Quick! Strike while it's off balance!"
"115740052-0-40823";"Now, some foes will try to restrain you."
"115740052-0-40824";"Quickly! Break free!"
"115740052-0-40825";"You're every bit the warrior I thought you'd be!"
"115740052-0-40826";"Now, bash the construct before it strikes!"
"115740052-0-40827";"Now, press your advantage with a heavy attack."
"115740052-0-40828";"When your enemy prepares an attack, strike! Interrupting their attack will set them off balance."
"115740052-0-40829";"When you're ready to show me to the other Ambitions, let me know. I'll lay low for a bit until then."
"115740052-0-40830";"Lead the way, my friend."
"115740052-0-40831";"We told Heem-Jas to stop trying to recruit strangers for this. He will not listen."
"115740052-0-40832";"This is where I gallantly apprehended the lieutenant. We are on the right track, let us continue."
"115740052-0-40833";"This is the largest of those totems I mentioned earlier. Oh, no."
"115740052-0-40834";"Ah!"
"115740052-0-40835";"Hey look! What do you guess is in here?"
"115740052-0-40838";"Stay back! Just let me go and I'll give you whatever you want!"
"115740052-0-40839";"There he is, Gracian Salvitto! Get him to tell you everything he knows!"
"115740052-0-40841";"Arrows! Nice ones, too. Why would someone leave these around?"
"115740052-0-40842";"You can go now, root-brother. Lie back. Rejoin the one, as all things must."
"115740052-0-40843";"I do not fear this, root-brother. But, I do regret …."
"115740052-0-40844";"Oh good, you're here. This dead stump has really been rustling my leaves."
"115740052-0-40845";"All right, we're aboard. Let's figure out our next move."
"115740052-0-40849";"Watch what those fancy arrows I found can do!"
"115740052-0-40850";"No. No! What have they done?"
"115740052-0-40851";"All right—I'm here. What'd I miss?"
"115740052-0-40852";"The writing is all strange scribbles. I think I'll hold onto it."
"115740052-0-40853";"I saw that book burner just ahead. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-40854";"There's some conductive oil up here! Maybe you can use it."
"115740052-0-40856";"The exit's not far off. Lead on."
"115740052-0-40857";"One of the stray golems. We might want to sneak past it."
"115740052-0-40858";"Almost there. Let's hurry!"
"115740052-0-40859";"You there. A moment of your time, please."
"115740052-0-40860";"Vandacia's weakening!"
"115740052-0-40861";"Xuth! His soul? What is this?"
"115740052-0-40862";"Uh oh. Another warded door ahead of us."
"115740052-0-40863";"The book … it's almost as though it wants to help us open the door."
"115740052-0-40864";"There it is! Send it back to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-40865";"By all the stars …. Look at the central column! I had no idea it was concealing something like this! Let's get a closer look."
"115740052-0-40866";"This is the Keywright's Gallery, but not as I remember it."
"115740052-0-40867";"Now I see why we never managed to unlock the gates. Their power comes from this arcane helix! Amazing!"
"115740052-0-40868";"With the helix exposed, these gates can finally reopen! Perhaps not all of them at first, but enough to reach most of Tamriel."
"115740052-0-40869";"The question for you, I suppose, is where to first?"
"115740052-0-40870";"We need to reach the base camp, but be careful. I saw a lot more cultists during my escape than the ones who led me here."
"115740052-0-40871";"You deal with the tailor. I need another moment to pick something out. They all look so … uncomfortable."
"115740052-0-40872";"Were you able to gather the silk?"
"115740052-0-40873";"That looks good on you! Hang on while I try this one on."
"115740052-0-40874";"Where does this piece go?"
"115740052-0-40875";"What am I supposed to do with this thing?"
"115740052-0-40876";"This is itchy and I can't breathe!"
"115740052-0-40877";"All right … there! So, how do I look?"
"115740052-0-40880";"All right, Salvitto. Let's go turn you over to Governor Keshu."
"115740052-0-40881";"Now that's what I call a distraction! Let's grab Sombren and get out of here."
"115740052-0-40882";"Some of our fallen warriors. But no sign of my apprentices among them."
"115740052-0-40883";"Look. In the sky to the south. The energies swirling above."
"115740052-0-40884";"We simply must do something about the business, brother. These chambers are much too small for our lifestyle."
"115740052-0-40885";"I realize that, Scipion, but the Fang-Furls have us by the throat. What am I to do?"
"115740052-0-40886";"This beast …. A corruption of the Hist's gift."
"115740052-0-40887";"We can continue into the xanmeer. And quickly—the clouds grow darker."
"115740052-0-40888";"Well, if you come back, meet me in the village. If I'm still alive."
"115740052-0-40889";"I saw some rather unsavory ruffians skulking about. Fang-Furls, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-40890";"They wouldn't dare approach us directly. We're safe enough, Iulius."
"115740052-0-40891";"All the same, I'd rather you not venture outside without me, brother."
"115740052-0-40893";"Ah, Kasa-Tah. And Manasha. So you have fallen."
"115740052-0-40894";"Now, all I ask for in return is to see the open sky."
"115740052-0-40895";"Hmm. I fear that their souls suffered the same fate as Veeka-Gel's."
"115740052-0-40896";"You must bring an end to this. They deserve to return to the Hist."
"115740052-0-40897";"Great Xalvakka drank deep from the souls we served her. Soon, she arrives!"
"115740052-0-40898";"See, I told you they'd come, Scipion!"
"115740052-0-40899";"Not now, Iulius! Our friend could be ambushed at any moment!"
"115740052-0-40900";"Fine! I'll deal with you myself!"
"115740052-0-40901";"Well fought! Now would you mind freeing us from these bindings?"
"115740052-0-40902";"Thank the divines. Those Fang-Furls have unpleasant knotwork."
"115740052-0-40903";"Let's not linger here. Shall we meet back at our office?"
"115740052-0-40905";"These runes … like nothing I've seen. Perhaps more in the ruins …."
"115740052-0-40906";"Those were Fang-Furls, weren't they?"
"115740052-0-40907";"Yes! They grabbed the two brothers and dragged them out of here. Horrid, but it's none of our business."
"115740052-0-40908";"The Dark Brotherhood's calling card."
"115740052-0-40909";"Is he okay?"
"115740052-0-40910";"I am satiated. Now is my time! Come, bugs, meet the great Xalvakka!"
"115740052-0-40911";"Xuth! Look how Xalvakka pulls the souls of my kin through the gate."
"115740052-0-40912";"With Bahsei dead, I do not know how to close the portal. We are still at great risk."
"115740052-0-40913";"Please, you must enter the gate and end this threat."
"115740052-0-40918";"Ah—souls of the brave and the doomed. Such a delicacy!"
"115740052-0-40919";"Help! Help! Somebody!"
"115740052-0-40920";"Come, mortal. This might be amusing!"
"115740052-0-40921";"Come, servants of Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40922";"Useless churls! Die and grant me strength!"
"115740052-0-40923";"I would not linger here. Flee, if you value your life!"
"115740052-0-40924";"You're back. There's … uh … no change here."
"115740052-0-40925";"Eolaf! He's dead …."
"115740052-0-40926";"Ardia … I hope you find peace at least. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-40927";"Hope you make it back to your trees, Deejos. We need to keep moving."
"115740052-0-40928";"Liam … Almsivi guide you to our ancestors, little brother."
"115740052-0-40929";"Eolaf! Follow me! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-40930";"Come on, Ardia—watch your step!"
"115740052-0-40931";"You're free! Come on!"
"115740052-0-40932";"Liam! Thank Vehk! I'll get you out of here."
"115740052-0-40933";"We … we're free! The fiend is destroyed!"
"115740052-0-40934";"You there. You must destroy the sigil stone. That will close the doorway to our home."
"115740052-0-40935";"So, this is the Dibellaseum. Just what I expected …."
"115740052-0-40937";"That weakened the shield! Keep at it!"
"115740052-0-40938";"The Waking Flame claims the Ambitions for Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-40939";"Think twice about hopping across stones in the murk. Sometimes they're crocodiles."
"115740052-0-40940";"I'm fairly sure Seeks ran off this way. Fairly."
"115740052-0-40941";"Hold on, I don't think I've been this way yet. Let's check it out!"
"115740052-0-40942";"Look! The stone flashed! Did you see it? Try to use it!"
"115740052-0-40943";"Hopefully these bastards are as dumb as they look, and haven't found the ruins yet."
"115740052-0-40944";"Kaoc, how big is this crypt?"
"115740052-0-40945";"Big room. Big statues. I wager there's some kind of complicated puzzle involving a hidden passage."
"115740052-0-40946";"I hear them, up ahead. Let's get going."
"115740052-0-40947";"You're not even going to apologize, are you?"
"115740052-0-40948";"I'm sorry?"
"115740052-0-40949";"Just keep your distance from Quistley. He's my responsibility."
"115740052-0-40950";"The gate is closed and the storm has calmed. It is over."
"115740052-0-40951";"The people of Ca-Uxith honor you, savior of Krona-Konu."
"115740052-0-40952";"Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-40953";"Hello? If you're looking for our guests, they're long gone."
"115740052-0-40954";"Something's happening. Is that—? It's a memory!"
"115740052-0-40955";"Who is that?"
"115740052-0-40956";"Mara's mercy!"
"115740052-0-40957";"Another flash! Try the stone now."
"115740052-0-40958";"Not another one …."
"115740052-0-40959";"Eight preserve me. It's so real."
"115740052-0-40961";"How revolting! We must be getting closer to the sorcerer's lair."
"115740052-0-40962";"So much muck! Stibbons's first task upon rescue will be a deep scrub of my boots."
"115740052-0-40963";"This is it. The sorcerer should be trapped beyond that door."
"115740052-0-40965";"Cool yourself in my waters."
"115740052-0-40966";"It's our killer again! What's he doing?"
"115740052-0-40967";"Gods! What is that? Magic?"
"115740052-0-40968";"Skeletons! Are those the murdered novitiates? I think I might …. Ugh! Come on, Faric, keep it together."
"115740052-0-40969";"Give it to me! Give it all to me!"
"115740052-0-40970";"Find anything?"
"115740052-0-40971";"More bones for my collection."
"115740052-0-40972";"Clara, Arielle, Edgard …. Yes, these were the novitiates. This should bring their families some closure, at least."
"115740052-0-40973";"Look! There in the water! Could that be it? See what you can find!"
"115740052-0-40974";"Destroy the ring, and I will pass to Aetherius. The choice, my lady, is yours."
"115740052-0-40975";"You should go say hello, right? I, uh … I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-40976";"That did it! The ritual's weakened."
"115740052-0-40979";"I think that did it! The gate's unsealed! Let's find Liam!"
"115740052-0-40980";"That's Granna Cerise, isn't it? She's been here in this cave all this time."
"115740052-0-40982";"Murder! They say Councilor Jirich was attacked in Leyawiin! That the Dark Brotherhood was involved!"
"115740052-0-40983";"The Dark Brotherhood? That's just a story to scare children!"
"115740052-0-40984";"Is Councilor Vandacia safe? Governor Keshu and the Black Fins will protect him, won't they?"
"115740052-0-40985";"It's probably got something to do with the war in the north. It was bound to spill into Blackwood eventually."
"115740052-0-40986";"No sign? Good. Carry on."
"115740052-0-40987";"Hold on! I recognize that journal. It belonged to Ardia."
"115740052-0-40988";"Is that—Ghalor! Over here!"
"115740052-0-40989";"Ghalor? Oh, fetching Vehk!"
"115740052-0-40990";"Councilor Vandacia is a traitor? He had the other councilors killed?"
"115740052-0-40991";"I never trusted that overblown dryskin."
"115740052-0-40992";"How did this happen? Where were the brigadines and the Black Fin Legion?"
"115740052-0-40993";"Soldiers can't stop fanatical cultists. It's a known fact of nature."
"115740052-0-40994";"The Order of the Waking Flame has an army! They're marching on Gideon!"
"115740052-0-40995";"Damn cultists! The Black Fin Legion will give them what for!"
"115740052-0-40996";"I thought you said soldiers were useless against a cult like the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"115740052-0-40997";"Well, if those mercenaries from Leyawiin lend a hand, that should make a big difference."
"115740052-0-40999";"Did you hear about the battle at Fort Redmane? The Black Fin Legion and the Ivory Brigade won the day!"
"115740052-0-41000";"Thanks to those mercenaries from Leyawiin that I told you about!"
"115740052-0-41001";"Yes, you are the smartest lizard in Gideon. But I heard Mehrunes Dagon actually appeared!"
"115740052-0-41002";"A Daedric Prince, here? Nonsense! But I do want to thank the mercenaries for helping Blackwood. Both the cute Wood Elf and her friend!"
"115740052-0-41003";"Xigira! If you think a little lava is going to stop me you've got another thing coming!"
"115740052-0-41004";"Liam! Can you hear me? Big sis is getting you out of this!"
"115740052-0-41005";"All right, I'll give this a try. For the village, right?"
"115740052-0-41006";"I don't … I don't feel so good … hurk …."
"115740052-0-41008";"Endure, Nord. The foothold is nearly complete!"
"115740052-0-41009";"You came back, Mirri. I look forward to reuniting you with your brother."
"115740052-0-41010";"Keep meddling, Mirri, and I'll make you watch your brother waste away."
"115740052-0-41011";"Do you think we'll see anything worthwhile today?"
"115740052-0-41012";"This close to a well-traveled road? Anything worth seeing has either been picked up or scared away."
"115740052-0-41013";"Next time we plan a route, I get to choose the roads we use."
"115740052-0-41014";"Why would Lord Silvelle keep a letter intended for me? Read it, would you? If it's some sort of terrible news, at least you can break it to me gently."
"115740052-0-41015";"That is a mystery I want to solve. I need to speak to my friend here first, but I … I have so many questions for you!"
"115740052-0-41016";"Good. Now, follow Tiras! He must be drawn to the central lode!"
"115740052-0-41017";"You can inform your worthless legates that we stopped the cultists, no thanks to you!"
"115740052-0-41018";"Just be grateful your little dispute didn't land you afoul of the law. Cease your meddlesome trespassing while you're ahead and get a real job."
"115740052-0-41019";"About time. I was beginning to think I'd hired the wrong courier."
"115740052-0-41020";"Vandacia might be at the Salvitto Estate near Blackwood Lake? But what sort of event are they talking about?"
"115740052-0-41021";"Well. Let's get this farce underway."
"115740052-0-41022";"Did you see those gestures? Can you repeat them?"
"115740052-0-41023";"Mara's mercy!"
"115740052-0-41024";"Hang on, little brother. I'll save you, even if the fetching militia won't."
"115740052-0-41025";"Stop them, my brethren! I need to reach my boat!"
"115740052-0-41027";"This looks like the place Quistley told us about. Hold up—let's talk before we go in."
"115740052-0-41028";"Over here, my friend!"
"115740052-0-41029";"Armor and Fine Garments is right in the city center. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-41030";"Ah, there you are. I knew you'd come!"
"115740052-0-41031";"I'm here, Quistley. What do you want? And what do you have for me?"
"115740052-0-41032";"Easy, Bastian. You seem a bit … irritated. Why don't I talk to your reasonable friend here?"
"115740052-0-41033";"Now just … fine. That's probably for the best."
"115740052-0-41034";"You there! The Ivory Brigade has need of you!"
"115740052-0-41035";"We warned you, Faric Gemain! Your foolish quest ends here!"
"115740052-0-41036";"Did you find it? Do you have my ring?"
"115740052-0-41037";"Councilor Jirich? Oh, pardon me! You're not the councilor."
"115740052-0-41038";"Music"
"115740052-0-41039";"Well, it looks like Quistley's in luck. The ring is still here. He'd better be outside with my letter."
"115740052-0-41040";"So you can chose another path and miss me?"
"115740052-0-41041";"Over here! Did you find it?"
"115740052-0-41042";"We found your ring. Now give me my letter."
"115740052-0-41043";"Ring first, please. I wouldn't put it past you to take it straight to Father and make me get it from him."
"115740052-0-41044";"Oh no! Councilor Abor's been murdered! But where's the servant?"
"115740052-0-41046";"I guess we should just … ask around? Someone must know Inalieth."
"115740052-0-41047";"I will return and speak to Naheesh Nurwul. Meet me there when you can."
"115740052-0-41048";"Please excuse the mess, your excellency."
"115740052-0-41049";"Stay on the path. The keep is just ahead."
"115740052-0-41050";"Fools! You have rent the gate asunder!"
"115740052-0-41051";"How much longer, Sombren? This place makes me feel uneasy."
"115740052-0-41052";"Not long now. I'm almost—oh. It seems we have company."
"115740052-0-41053";"Oh hey, over here!"
"115740052-0-41054";"Now your world is mine to lay waste!"
"115740052-0-41055";"The bridge is out, but that support looks sturdy enough for the grapple bow."
"115740052-0-41056";"Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!"
"115740052-0-41057";"Ha! You just ate a bowl of tree sap!"
"115740052-0-41058";"Woah, gross! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-41059";"It was a joke!"
"115740052-0-41060";"Stinger 1"
"115740052-0-41061";"Stinger 2"
"115740052-0-41062";"Stinger 3"
"115740052-0-41063";"Who dares … interrupt this sacred ceremony? Destroy them!"
"115740052-0-41064";"You cannot kill what cannot die!"
"115740052-0-41065";"You! My meal arrives, at last."
"115740052-0-41066";"Put it past me …? I keep my word, Quistley. But deal with my comrade if it makes you feel better."
"115740052-0-41067";"That voice! Xigira!"
"115740052-0-41069";"Lava? And look, those trees! The shifting is more drastic here."
"115740052-0-41070";"Go on your way, strangers! I don't have much, if you think to rob me."
"115740052-0-41071";"Oh, my little lord. It does my heart good to see you grown and well."
"115740052-0-41072";"Inalieth, I do remember you. Is … is what you say true? I was to be sent to my sister and her family?"
"115740052-0-41073";"Your mother insisted on it. She wanted you to be with your kin. Why that never happened, I don't know."
"115740052-0-41074";"That sounds delicious, assassin! You must leave me a copy of the recipe."
"115740052-0-41076";"There you are! Ready to investigate the sanctuary?"
"115740052-0-41077";"Mercenary, you're needed back in Leyawiin Castle."
"115740052-0-41078";"Welcome, people of Blackwood and honored friends! We have weathered a terrible storm, so now we celebrate!"
"115740052-0-41079";"Many had a hand in this victory, including those who gave their lives for our cause. But I want to honor the two heroes beside me. Without them, all would have been lost!"
"115740052-0-41080";"So stand tall and raise your cups to the sky! Remember those who fell and praise the deeds of those who lived. To victory!"
"115740052-0-41081";"Hey, over here!"
"115740052-0-41082";"Place the reekers around the chamber, then give me the signal when you're done."
"115740052-0-41083";"You there! Do you bring news? Or are you here to deliver a demand?"
"115740052-0-41084";"He looks upset. Maybe you should sound him out?"
"115740052-0-41085";"Hey! That shouldn't be there!"
"115740052-0-41086";"You … you … let your own wife believe that her brother was dead?"
"115740052-0-41087";"I made the decision many years ago, when I was young and new to my title. And newly married to a woman I only wanted to protect."
"115740052-0-41088";"You left a young child with strangers! They brought me up as … as a glorified servant."
"115740052-0-41089";"They were to use the funds you had to see to your education. And raise you as a gentleman."
"115740052-0-41090";"It should have been her decision, not yours. Bah. I am going to find my sister. For her sake, not yours."
"115740052-0-41091";"This looks like the right place. I'm not the praying sort, but I'm praying my sister is unharmed. Slavers are no joke."
"115740052-0-41092";"Dangerous? We're heroes! All right, Lyranth. I'll scout ahead. You talk to them, partner."
"115740052-0-41093";"Hey! We've got trouble! I need you!"
"115740052-0-41094";"Damn it! She's sealed the gate! We need to remove that barrier! That switch might have something to do with it."
"115740052-0-41095";"Um … I think we may have found those weapons …."
"115740052-0-41097";"Hey! What happened to the vault?"
"115740052-0-41098";"Are we still inside the vault? This doesn't look like Blackwood to me!"
"115740052-0-41099";"Really? Lava and an ominous sky? Oblivion stuff is weird."
"115740052-0-41100";"That's sort of pretty. Disturbing and terrifying, but pretty."
"115740052-0-41101";"There must be a lever or a switch around here someplace!"
"115740052-0-41102";"You won't get away with kidnapping a countess! If you had any brains, you'd flee now."
"115740052-0-41103";"It looks like we can get out through here … if you don't mind getting a little wet."
"115740052-0-41104";"I feel like we must be getting close. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-41105";"Arise, my brother! Kill these trespassers!"
"115740052-0-41106";"Did my husband send—oh, never mind. Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-41107";"Bodies? Of Imperials and our own?"
"115740052-0-41108";"Yes, fighting together! And their wounds were jagged, as if they were from mighty beasts!"
"115740052-0-41109";"Gods, this can't be happening."
"115740052-0-41110";"I can't believe that I am free! How can I thank my gallant rescuers?"
"115740052-0-41111";"My apologies on behalf of my tribe, lieutenant. Let us get you out of there."
"115740052-0-41112";"I will meet you at the ruins!"
"115740052-0-41113";"I only just learned that you were alive. I wish … I wish I'd known sooner."
"115740052-0-41114";"Bastian? The last time I saw you, you were only a toddler. I did not even know that you were alive."
"115740052-0-41115";"The entrance to Xal Irasotl should be along the bottom of the structure. Let us hurry."
"115740052-0-41116";"You look so much like our father! But you probably have no memories of him, do you?"
"115740052-0-41117";"There, the door!"
"115740052-0-41118";"Sadly, I do not. Nor you, Clairene. I would … I would like to find out what I've missed."
"115740052-0-41119";"Allow me to reward you for hampering our progress. You may listen to your brother's muffled screams unmolested as you stand helpless before this gateway."
"115740052-0-41120";"I as well. Oh, I have so many questions for you! Did you know you have a niece and nephew to meet?"
"115740052-0-41121";"I would like that. And I have many questions for you, too. But first let me speak to my friend here."
"115740052-0-41122";"Clairene! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-41123";"Clairene, I've been worried sick! Thank the Eight that you are all right."
"115740052-0-41124";"All is well, Elmonde. The heroes you sent succeeded. And … I have something extraordinary to tell you."
"115740052-0-41125";"I know, my dear. I know. An old wrong can be set right today."
"115740052-0-41127";"I feared for your life. I know I should have told you about Bastian. But I will earn your forgiveness. And his. I promise you."
"115740052-0-41128";"A dark mine, full of slavers. Perfect for a family reunion."
"115740052-0-41129";"The wrath of Mehrunes Dagon melts away the unworthy!"
"115740052-0-41130";"There's the door!"
"115740052-0-41131";"Mehrunes Dagon's fiery might will crush you from above!"
"115740052-0-41132";"You come to fight Xeemhok? Xeemhok fights!"
"115740052-0-41133";"No! Xeemhok must … take … trophies …."
"115740052-0-41134";"I told you we were being followed, acolyte. Let's show them the true power of the Waking Flame!"
"115740052-0-41135";"This one hears and obeys! Death to the mortals!"
"115740052-0-41136";"Very well. I shall deal with you myself."
"115740052-0-41137";"Oh, well done, little mortal! That stench is horrendous!"
"115740052-0-41138";"Damn, the high priest is getting away."
"115740052-0-41139";"Stop them! Recapture the Ambition at all costs!"
"115740052-0-41140";"No matter. Come. If we can reach the entry hall, I can open a portal back to Nirn."
"115740052-0-41141";"The mortals call this a fortress? Its very stone crumbles in my presence."
"115740052-0-41142";"Pathetic! Are those arrows or fleabites?"
"115740052-0-41143";"Run, little maggots! Flee from the God of Destruction!"
"115740052-0-41144";"Tremble before me as your realm becomes mine!"
"115740052-0-41145";"I need to grab Quistley before he runs off again, the little bastard."
"115740052-0-41146";"Oh no you don't! I found him first!"
"115740052-0-41147";"I'm clearly not dead."
"115740052-0-41148";"We should leave this place. I'll see Quistley on his way when he comes around."
"115740052-0-41149";"That portal should take you back toward the exit … or to some terrible plane of Oblivion. One or the other."
"115740052-0-41150";"I opened a portal, little mortal. Take your companions and leave this place."
"115740052-0-41151";"We shall see each other again. I guarantee it!"
"115740052-0-41152";"Now, if you're going to be a proper Hopeful, I'm going to need you to take a form similar to one of my players. Can you do that?"
"115740052-0-41153";"Oh! Yes! With your help that will be easy! How is this?"
"115740052-0-41154";"You'll have no difficulty with brisk scene changes, certainly. Now for a name that speaks to your soul. What about … Dreamer?"
"115740052-0-41155";"Dreamer. I like that very much."
"115740052-0-41156";"Beragon! When did you get here?"
"115740052-0-41157";"I came as soon as word arrived from Councilor Lovidicus. I was with him when the cultists attacked, but we got separated."
"115740052-0-41158";"Farewell."
"115740052-0-41159";"Do you mind? Those are my personal thoughts!"
"115740052-0-41160";"We must help him. That poor soul!"
"115740052-0-41161";"Destron says my talent has improved."
"115740052-0-41162";"Interesting. A totem revering Mehrunes Dagon, I believe."
"115740052-0-41164";"I'll tell you what I told Vandacia … I'm Sombren and I won't perform for the pleasure of a Dagon cult!"
"115740052-0-41165";"You get the key. I'll stay here and watch over Sombren."
"115740052-0-41167";"So much rot and squalor. Will any record of Gavos or the anvil have survived?"
"115740052-0-41168";"There, that should be the abbey's adytum!"
"115740052-0-41169";"It worked! The adytum is unsealed! Let's not waste another moment!"
"115740052-0-41170";"We have to find Lovidicus! Come with us, brother. We need to stick together."
"115740052-0-41171";"What is that thing? Kill it, kill it!"
"115740052-0-41172";"Curse you relics! Why will you not stop?"
"115740052-0-41173";"Olik? You did this?"
"115740052-0-41174";"Heem-Jas! I am sorry."
"115740052-0-41175";"But what if we are wrong? Not even my strength can hold back an entire brigade!"
"115740052-0-41176";"Just stay out of it, Heem-Jas. We have lost too many lives already, yours need not be included."
"115740052-0-41177";"Outsider, this Imperial speaks lies. Our people did not vanish until they arrived."
"115740052-0-41178";"There you are! This is where our investigation begins. Let us look around."
"115740052-0-41179";"There are more footprints ahead, toward the water."
"115740052-0-41180";"I think there are more farther ahead. I wonder if they are active as well?"
"115740052-0-41181";"Perhaps we will find survivors farther up this way."
"115740052-0-41182";"Heem-Jas, if this is another story … Naheesh Nurwul, I will go verify the truth of this claim."
"115740052-0-41183";"I'm Destron. And this is my sister, Calia. But who are you?"
"115740052-0-41184";"My name is Sombren. And I, like you, am an Ambition."
"115740052-0-41185";"Another Ambition? Truly? How very nice to meet you!"
"115740052-0-41186";"Councilor, this way! Before the odor overwhelms you!"
"115740052-0-41187";"Help is here, my friend. Let us begin."
"115740052-0-41188";"Naheesh Nurwul! And the Imperials? I am sorry, this is my fault."
"115740052-0-41189";"The time for blame can come later. We're here to help."
"115740052-0-41190";"Now go! I will deal with the intruders! They will not escape this keep."
"115740052-0-41191";"Thank you."
"115740052-0-41192";"We will fix this, Olik. Do not worry."
"115740052-0-41193";"I'll need a moment to whip something together with these seeds, but we'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-41194";"I can mix up something to ease her passing, at the least. I—I'll be out once she's at peace."
"115740052-0-41195";"Darkness and shadows will claim you!"
"115740052-0-41196";"I think it is working!"
"115740052-0-41197";"It seems the Imperials up above are succeeding as well!"
"115740052-0-41198";"That was the last one. Now, I will make a swift, daring exit and run back to the village. Meet you there!"
"115740052-0-41199";"You have my thanks, lieutenant, as well as my tribe's friendship."
"115740052-0-41200";"Thank you. I assure you, we will do everything in our power to make sure this is the start of a prosperous friendship between our people."
"115740052-0-41201";"A great success! We are victorious and strong and all mostly intact!"
"115740052-0-41202";"While my power finishes recharging, take a look at what I found. I left it over there."
"115740052-0-41203";"No mortal is allowed here. Not even the high priest. I shall wear your flesh like a cloak!"
"115740052-0-41204";"Poured something on the lock … hit me and escaped …."
"115740052-0-41205";"He ran that way … toward the old ruins …."
"115740052-0-41206";"If you've never been to Shadowfen, we can probably hire a boat to ferry us there. It'd be easier on our boots anyway."
"115740052-0-41207";"That High Elf matches Mirtulivon's description! Ask him if he's seen Irenni Elendis. I should probably hang back."
"115740052-0-41208";"Xigira! Give Liam back and maybe I won't fetching kill you!"
"115740052-0-41209";"Act casual. Just two people admiring the decorations. This is such a nice bank, isn't it? Oh, such refined taste."
"115740052-0-41210";"He almost knocked me over! How rude!"
"115740052-0-41211";"See to Eveli. I shall get Calia and Destron to safety."
"115740052-0-41212";"Nonsense, child. You are an Ambition! The high priest has great plans for you."
"115740052-0-41213";"Your destruction is imminent, mortals."
"115740052-0-41218";"He attacked this legionnaire and ran into the ruins of the old city!"
"115740052-0-41219";"I am devastation and thunder! I am your end!"
"115740052-0-41220";"Is this Edvilda? Someone killed her! Let's search the camp."
"115740052-0-41222";"Mom's scarf! Liam gave that to her last New Life, when she was headed to Skyrim for the Snow Bear Plunge. She wouldn't have left it!"
"115740052-0-41223";"Did Edvilda write down anything important?"
"115740052-0-41224";"Dwarven pipes! By that cave. This looks promising."
"115740052-0-41225";"What was that?"
"115740052-0-41226";"Skulking cowards! Come and fight!"
"115740052-0-41229";"The Waking Flame is definitely trying to occupy this sanctuary. But why?"
"115740052-0-41230";"I happily offer my soul to Xalvakka …."
"115740052-0-41231";"With the seal gone, we should be able to use the other door to exit this place, once I've said some final prayers for the abbey."
"115740052-0-41232";"Such brave prey to enter my realm. You shall be a quick snack."
"115740052-0-41233";"Look around! Do you truly think you can escape from here?"
"115740052-0-41234";"Hear now, clutch-kin of nothing-speakers."
"115740052-0-41235";"May your soul pass through void beyond void, and return to the Hist."
"115740052-0-41236";"Rivers ten and two sundered into the shadow of one."
"115740052-0-41237";"Inelegant but ever-changing."
"115740052-0-41238";"The Hist watches, the soul flows."
"115740052-0-41239";"And so be born again under nothing-stars."
"115740052-0-41240";"It is finished."
"115740052-0-41241";"You return to me at last."
"115740052-0-41242";"The faithless wanderer succeeds where my servants fail. Once again, the fruits of devotion prove inferior to the benefits of skill. Claim your reward from Millona, mortal. You find favor in the shadows."
"115740052-0-41244";"I told you not to spook him."
"115740052-0-41245";"I was perfectly civil."
"115740052-0-41246";"Your brand of civility leaves much to be desired."
"115740052-0-41247";"Hmph."
"115740052-0-41248";"Ah, good. You've arrived."
"115740052-0-41249";"How's this, sister?"
"115740052-0-41250";"More dramatic, Destron. More … panache!"
"115740052-0-41251";"Calia, just make sure it actually looks like me this time."
"115740052-0-41252";"Oh brother, I always capture the real you!"
"115740052-0-41253";"Dance, my servant! Spin and swirl! Oh-oh, but don't singe the rug!"
"115740052-0-41254";"You're back. Any luck?"
"115740052-0-41255";"Xocin hasn't contacted anyone else in the Legion. Tell me you have something."
"115740052-0-41256";"He's looking for Xyria."
"115740052-0-41257";"Ah, I should have guessed."
"115740052-0-41258";"Well, that explains why he didn't tell us anything."
"115740052-0-41259";"I can't believe Vandacia fooled us. Or that he's in charge of these fanatics."
"115740052-0-41260";"This is going to be great! Just wait until I tell all my friends back in Bravil."
"115740052-0-41261";"I think that's all of them! Now let's get Liam out of here!"
"115740052-0-41262";"To Black Marsh! Maybe I should practice my terrified screaming."
"115740052-0-41264";"Oh no-ahhhh mmmmmm! Mmmmm! M! plech."
"115740052-0-41267";"There you are! Captain Rian sent me to find you."
"115740052-0-41268";"Mirri? Mirri! Am I glad to see you, scrib. Get me out of these shackles."
"115740052-0-41270";"Don't think you're free and clear just because we escaped the bandits. What were you thinking?"
"115740052-0-41271";"Oh, come now, Mirri. I've been doing this since before you were in diapers."
"115740052-0-41272";"And you're not getting any younger! We almost lost Liam, and you nearly lost this! Would you trade it for that stupid puzzle box?"
"115740052-0-41273";"Liam's scarf? Mirri—I … I'm sorry. I'm sorry I worried you all. It's just … I'll let it go."
"115740052-0-41274";"Xyria, if I am to die here, would I go to the same place as you?"
"115740052-0-41275";"Nicely done. I can see why you like them, Mirri."
"115740052-0-41276";"I have enough magicka to shroud myself from sight. I won't be far behind."
"115740052-0-41277";"This is the family plot. Light the votive candles, would you? I'll begin the incantation."
"115740052-0-41278";"That should be enough. I have my strength back, I will go to Tee-Wan. Meet me there."
"115740052-0-41279";"Just you wait! Not even fire can scare off a vampire like me!"
"115740052-0-41280";"Good to have you back, brother."
"115740052-0-41281";"Would've preferred not to have to send someone after you."
"115740052-0-41282";"I know. I am grateful to you all, but I had to take this chance."
"115740052-0-41283";"The conjuration ritual starts now. Stand back."
"115740052-0-41284";"Xyria Kynaz Clan Shardai! Xan Faydra Shardai! Xan Dagon Xyria! Xocin Acam Xyria!"
"115740052-0-41285";"Xocin, my love! You found me."
"115740052-0-41286";"My dearest Xyria, I never stopped searching. You remember my family?"
"115740052-0-41287";"Of course. Except for this one."
"115740052-0-41288";"A new friend, most worthy. Without them, I would not have been able to bring you back."
"115740052-0-41289";"Then you have my thanks as well, hero. And my promise of aid in the battles to come."
"115740052-0-41290";"I respect your wishes. But I'm sorry, I cannot lose this chance."
"115740052-0-41291";"I'm sorry, Tee-Wan, Vos-Huruk. If I cannot bring Xyria here, then I will go to her."
"115740052-0-41292";"Xocin, wait!"
"115740052-0-41293";"See, Tee-Wan? This is what happens when you fall in love."
"115740052-0-41294";"Grandfather, house of my house, blood of my blood. The daughter of your daughter summons you. Come forth and share your wisdom."
"115740052-0-41295";"Daughter of my daughter? Bah. Strangers both. I have nothing to say to the likes of you."
"115740052-0-41296";"Onimiril's departure is no excuse. You two are mages of the guild first. I expect to see you both in my office shortly."
"115740052-0-41297";"But Master Onimiril is gone now and—"
"115740052-0-41299";"Takaano will wait here."
"115740052-0-41300";"Not much of a retreat, if you ask me. Let's see if Onimiril left anything helpful behind."
"115740052-0-41301";"Find anything useful in all that scribble?"
"115740052-0-41302";"Glad to be out of there. Dwarf ruins are too hot and humid for my liking. At least Stonefalls is a dry heat."
"115740052-0-41303";"Something tells me Onimiril's theory didn't pan out. Maybe be gentle with that box."
"115740052-0-41304";"Feeling all right? No all consuming desire to solve the unknowable mystery? Great, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-41306";"Here's Elossi's hut. She may not be home, but let's check just in case."
"115740052-0-41307";"This place is huge! No sign of the Dark Brotherhood. Just a lot of creepy undead. Let's keep going!"
"115740052-0-41309";"Got it? Let's not overstay our welcome."
"115740052-0-41310";"I had heard that Meer-Ta retreated to a cavern for solitude and study. Let's look near there and see if we can find any clues."
"115740052-0-41311";"This is his hut. I'll go ahead and see if I can find him!"
"115740052-0-41312";"Sul-Xan? They're a nasty bunch!"
"115740052-0-41313";"Now choose a drink and get started!"
"115740052-0-41314";"Ah, a good start! But let's see how you do with even more!"
"115740052-0-41315";"Bitter, isn't it? I make that myself! From whatever I find around the hut."
"115740052-0-41316";"Ha! Oh, I thought you would fall to the ground like good Nuxul after that one. One more!"
"115740052-0-41317";"The final one and still you stand! A will made of true iron you must have. Come, let's speak."
"115740052-0-41318";"We are under attack! Those dumb villagers think they can take us!"
"115740052-0-41319";"Hold the line, you cowards! And protect those weapons!"
"115740052-0-41320";"Ah! My friend! Up here! I have need of you!"
"115740052-0-41321";"Psst! Outsider. Over here. Quickly."
"115740052-0-41322";"Continue the fight! Remove these pests from our home."
"115740052-0-41323";"Ah, finally you show. Voss, I have need of you."
"115740052-0-41324";"Look for a scroll that was recently man-handled by brutes."
"115740052-0-41325";"The banner burns! Warlord Naxhosa has fallen!"
"115740052-0-41326";"Scatter. Everyone for themselves. Grab what you can."
"115740052-0-41327";"Mom! Do you have any fetching idea how worried—wait … are you cooking?"
"115740052-0-41328";"Can we please just get out of here now?"
"115740052-0-41329";"They did it! The bandits flee!"
"115740052-0-41330";"The village belongs to us again. Sing for the Winds."
"115740052-0-41331";"Sun, bless the Winds. They freed us."
"115740052-0-41332";"We love you, mom. We're your family. Go home."
"115740052-0-41333";"I don't know why anyone would eat chicken when they could have a plump pony guar."
"115740052-0-41334";"Aggh! What is that and why does it smell so bad?"
"115740052-0-41335";"Ugh, Takaano! I ought to bawk your ears for—did I just cluck?"
"115740052-0-41336";"B'vehk … there!"
"115740052-0-41337";"My orders are to observe the ruin, not help you mount a suicidal rescue mission."
"115740052-0-41338";"Then you can observe me kicking every fetching cultist's arse standing between me and my little brother!"
"115740052-0-41339";"Mirri? Is that you? It had better not be another skeleton!"
"115740052-0-41340";"Father."
"115740052-0-41341";"You finally did your duty. Or rather your daughter and some n'wah did. Success—once removed—is so very like you."
"115740052-0-41342";"All you've ever cared about was what I could do for you. Well, this is the last favor."
"115740052-0-41343";"That goes for us as well."
"115740052-0-41344";"You've set a poor example for your daughter. Always putting your whims before the good of the house."
"115740052-0-41345";"You can stuff the fetching house. Our family is more than just your legacy. Come on, mom. We're wasting our breath."
"115740052-0-41346";"We're here mom, and we've brought granddad's puzzle box. Would you lay it on the shrine for her?"
"115740052-0-41347";"Hmm. Perhaps this was not such a grand idea."
"115740052-0-41349";"I just came by to—hey, where are Calia and Sombren?"
"115740052-0-41350";"Oh love, it's perfect! This outfit is everything I love about you."
"115740052-0-41351";"Wow, indeed, I do see. That is … quite the statement piece you settled on. I can see why you waited to show me."
"115740052-0-41352";"I … well. Sevilo that you under there? Could we at least see your face. It is a portrait, dear."
"115740052-0-41353";"Yes! I knew this was the perfect choice from the start!"
"115740052-0-41354";"The waist is a little … tight in places. I'm afraid to move much. Still, nothing but the best for my beautiful wife!"
"115740052-0-41355";"Oh, right. Yes I suppose that is rather the point of this whole endeavor. No matter, I will look my best even by going helmet-less."
"115740052-0-41356";"Illessan Tower? Fine, let's be on our way. Quickly, before I'm tempted to beat some sense into Quistley."
"115740052-0-41358";"This is all too much. Talk to Gavos, please. I must attend to the holy relic."
"115740052-0-41359";"I never should have cast that— But the ghost was there and I just … just panicked!"
"115740052-0-41360";"I can still feel Zenithar's presence here. However faint. All is not lost."
"115740052-0-41361";"By these hands and this coin, an honest days work is done in your name. May it be the first of many to come. Trade be."
"115740052-0-41363";"The anvil! Zen's light shines brightly once more!"
"115740052-0-41364";"Trade be. My work here is finally done."
"115740052-0-41365";"Huh. Surprisingly helpful."
"115740052-0-41366";"Argh! You will pay a high price for this insult, mortal!"
"115740052-0-41367";"Larger weapons like staves and greataxes will take both hands to use. You can pair smaller weapons with a shield or another weapon of that size. The choice is yours!"
"115740052-0-41368";"Once again I fight by your side, Otumi-Ra. My scales have itched for this moment."
"115740052-0-41369";"Let your blades sing their horrible song, Elossi. I delight in the tune!"
"115740052-0-41370";"I know where a map of this place is. It's not far. Just, you know, don't hit me!"
"115740052-0-41371";"Quistley!"
"115740052-0-41372";"Blessed Zenithar, I bring you this laborer whose calloused hands do your blessed work. Please, lay your hand upon the anvil."
"115740052-0-41373";"The sickle we took from Nocturnal is just what that necromancer needs to complete his ritual in Bloodrun Cave, of course it's worth it."
"115740052-0-41374";"Stealing from Nocturnal and working with Tumma-Maxath, it doesn't seem worth the risk."
"115740052-0-41375";"Just stay here until we receive further instructions."
"115740052-0-41376";"Barge in why don't you? It's not like I'm trying to work."
"115740052-0-41378";"I'll just be over here, counting my gold."
"115740052-0-41380";"Morgane? No … someone else. Listen, minions of Mephala and Mehrunes Dagon are fighting over a powerful Daedric device. We can't let either of them possess it."
"115740052-0-41381";"The Brotherhood sends its regards."
"115740052-0-41382";"Keep going! There's still cultist blood to spill here."
"115740052-0-41385";"It doesn't look like she's home. Let's see if we can figure out where she went."
"115740052-0-41386";"Ah! Elossi. We weren't doing anything."
"115740052-0-41387";"I think granddad's tomb is on the eastern side, toward the back."
"115740052-0-41388";"I hope this is the right one or it's going to make for an interesting scene back at the guild."
"115740052-0-41389";"So, you have skills. Even if you did let me sneak up on you. Let's speak."
"115740052-0-41390";"Oh dear … this one is in trouble now."
"115740052-0-41391";"There, that's his shrine. Tomb. Whatever. You light the candles. I'll mutter the ancestor summons prayer."
"115740052-0-41392";"The gift of a temporary visage I give to you, to experience the world with another's stoop!"
"115740052-0-41393";"Sad to say but my work is complete, ask me for another when next we meet!"
"115740052-0-41394";"Into the air with you, I command! There may be danger when you land."
"115740052-0-41395";"My lady Nocturnal, I beg you!"
"115740052-0-41396";"Ungrateful child, bear the consequence of your failure with grace."
"115740052-0-41397";"You, mortal, I command you to speak with me!"
"115740052-0-41398";"Well aren't you a dear? And handy too. You finally found a catch, Mirri."
"115740052-0-41399";"Mother! Not now."
"115740052-0-41400";"Don't be rude, Mirri. Introduce me to my rescuer."
"115740052-0-41401";"Ugh! Humor her, please."
"115740052-0-41402";"So? Did you finish your dangerous job for Tumma-Maxath?"
"115740052-0-41403";"Shh! There are guards around. We'll speak later, I'm late for my meeting with Darene."
"115740052-0-41405";"These ruins look … uninviting. Let's be careful."
"115740052-0-41406";"Well, a cache of daggers in the ruins. They must be Elossi's."
"115740052-0-41407";"Ah. You're off to find this Annyce girl, then? Tell me what you've learned—I wasn't able to overhear everything."
"115740052-0-41408";"Footprints … coming here, and heading somewhere else."
"115740052-0-41409";"Now then, let me see what I can do with these."
"115740052-0-41410";"A torn page … we're closing in."
"115740052-0-41411";"If you come to any conclusions, do let me know. Ta-ta!"
"115740052-0-41412";"That's it, then? Well, let's have a look."
"115740052-0-41413";"Ghostly figure I command, so show what it looks like at the end!"
"115740052-0-41414";"The next time that impudent wizard summons me, he'll be mine."
"115740052-0-41415";"It's ready. Wake Annyce, and the curse will break."
"115740052-0-41417";"Very well, then. Let's be off."
"115740052-0-41418";"Good! Now lead it to the pressure plate and have him stand on it!"
"115740052-0-41419";"No … Destron, is that us up there?"
"115740052-0-41420";"And Mehrunes Dagon? Is this our future, Calia? Is this … inevitable?"
"115740052-0-41421";"Friend of my sister, come speak with me."
"115740052-0-41422";"Lord Dagon, I return to you the power of this Ambition! Let the realms merge so you may walk among us!"
"115740052-0-41423";"The worlds are merging, Sombren! There is no escape. When you tire of running, I will be waiting in the courtyard."
"115740052-0-41424";"Takaano hopes this works."
"115740052-0-41425";"Still no sign of the Ambitions? Tangled roots, what a mess!"
"115740052-0-41426";"Vandacia should be just through that door. I'll cover you from the battlements."
"115740052-0-41427";"Bralen sent you? Didn't he? He'll never have it back!"
"115740052-0-41428";"A crushing like none other! Now, hurry. Seek out Naxhosa."
"115740052-0-41429";"So far—only half successful. Let's go find Otumi-Ra's hut."
"115740052-0-41430";"This letter is for you, mercenary."
"115740052-0-41431";"Take Sombren to the Temple of Dibella, then meet me at the governor's mansion!"
"115740052-0-41432";"When you're ready, meet me back at the docks."
"115740052-0-41433";"I'm right behind you. Let's go see what this is all about."
"115740052-0-41434";"Hey, I'm over here!"
"115740052-0-41435";"Vandacia, you traitor …."
"115740052-0-41436";"Vandacia … the bastard fooled us all!"
"115740052-0-41437";"Get my luggage to the docks! Hurry, I want to set sail with the tide!"
"115740052-0-41438";"You don't have to tell me twice!"
"115740052-0-41439";"I—I'm just a little unsteady!"
"115740052-0-41440";"You came back for me?"
"115740052-0-41441";"Mirri! I thought I'd never see you again!"
"115740052-0-41445";"I have to send word back home, about Liam. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-41446";"I'm no use in a fight right now, I'll keep back."
"115740052-0-41447";"We have to stop Xynaa. Attack!"
"115740052-0-41449";"I should get word that we're safe to our parents as soon as possible. I hope to see you again soon. And Liam, straight to Leyawiin, you hear?"
"115740052-0-41450";"I just want a moment to catch my breath and thank your friend here. Mother."
"115740052-0-41451";"Yes! Give chase, my morsels! Deliver yourselves to me!"
"115740052-0-41452";"I am but a herald! A horde awaits behind me!"
"115740052-0-41453";"There are more of these abominations on the balcony!"
"115740052-0-41454";"Voss Xalvakka! Gorge on these souls and grow mighty."
"115740052-0-41455";"Can you feel it? Power rises from the deep!"
"115740052-0-41456";"I'll return the book when we come back, Eveli."
"115740052-0-41457";"Nah, you keep it. I think it was meant for you."
"115740052-0-41458";"Into the pits of destruction you go. We bring forth Xalvakka!"
"115740052-0-41459";"I'll see you at the party! Last one there doesn't get any cake!"
"115740052-0-41460";"And you're not getting any younger! We already lost Liam, and you nearly lost this! Would you trade it for that stupid puzzle box?"
"115740052-0-41461";"Irenni. You … are forgiven."
"115740052-0-41462";"If you want my advice on carrying on our good name. You may come to me again."
"115740052-0-41463";"Oh, may I? How gracious. I can manage without you, father, but … I may come again. To visit."
"115740052-0-41464";"Have no fear for the blacksmith. Some waking seeds shall fix him up!"
"115740052-0-41465";"What's going on? Where are we going?"
"115740052-0-41466";"Whatever happens, stay close to me."
"115740052-0-41467";"How touching. Makes me want to rip out my eyes."
"115740052-0-41468";"Come with me you two. It's not safe here anymore."
"115740052-0-41469";"You want us to go … outside?"
"115740052-0-41470";"Time to say goodbye to this place, Calia. It will be a new adventure."
"115740052-0-41471";"In Xalvakka's name, we claim your soul!"
"115740052-0-41472";"Denied! Trespass no farther or you will be met with force, heathen."
"115740052-0-41473";"I told you bargaining wouldn't work."
"115740052-0-41474";"It was a courtesy. They must face Azura's wrath now."
"115740052-0-41475";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-41476";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-41477";"Yes, Laur-ahn!"
"115740052-0-41478";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-41479";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-41480";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-41481";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-41482";"Yes, Laur-ahn! Stibbo stay!"
"115740052-0-41483";"I do not think we will find anything over that way."
"115740052-0-41485";"The condition of these servant houses. They're falling apart."
"115740052-0-41486";"Completely abandoned. Something is very wrong here."
"115740052-0-41487";"A journal? Perhaps this will tell us what led to this sorry state of affairs."
"115740052-0-41488";"I'd like to see what we can learn here, but you should press on before the knights mount a counterattack."
"115740052-0-41489";"I can watch over Weylin. We'll catch up once you've cleared a path."
"115740052-0-41490";"I expected greater resistance. It seems the Silver Rose are short on more than servants."
"115740052-0-41491";"Good, now destroy it!"
"115740052-0-41492";"Oh, ho ho! They're still here. Just not everyone takes to these toys as well as me. Hee hee hahahaha!"
"115740052-0-41493";"Sanity seems in short supply as well."
"115740052-0-41494";"Could you not have silenced that idiot any sooner?"
"115740052-0-41495";"What is that odor? It smells like livestock and baked goods. Did we miss the fair?"
"115740052-0-41496";"Well, that's not the only disconcerting thing in the air. The seneschal's notes expressed concern with the knights' fixation on Daedric artifacts. The order even began deploying them in their crusade."
"115740052-0-41497";"So we've seen. Whether we must pry the artifacts out of a vault or their cold, dead hands is of little consequence until we find them."
"115740052-0-41498";"Can you feel that? Great emanations from beyond that door."
"115740052-0-41499";"And strongly warded. Maintaining it requires great power. There must be a source nearby."
"115740052-0-41500";"The priest and I will search right, you check the room to the left."
"115740052-0-41501";"Stibbo kill!"
"115740052-0-41502";"What's keeping you? We already dispelled part of the ward."
"115740052-0-41503";"Stibbo make hurt now!"
"115740052-0-41504";"Now Stibbo serves the tea."
"115740052-0-41505";"There, the ward should be no more. Let's return to Weylin."
"115740052-0-41506";"Dispelling the ward did nothing to reduce those dreadful emanations. In fact, it only made them worse. Proceed with caution."
"115740052-0-41507";"By Azura! Look at all of these relics. They're the source of the troubling energies I felt."
"115740052-0-41508";"They're twisting more than the knights. I need to banish the miasma before it gets any worse."
"115740052-0-41509";"Those things were once mortals. Oblivion tainted them to the core."
"115740052-0-41510";"The corruption will continue to well up here until it floods out from these ruins. I must cast it out."
"115740052-0-41511";"Azura, I offer you this power. May it provide succor to your chosen."
"115740052-0-41512";"Just don't forget why we are here, priest."
"115740052-0-41513";"That did it, but I still feel more corruption beyond this room. Let's press on."
"115740052-0-41514";"Then you take us far too lightly."
"115740052-0-41515";"I am slightly impressed by the size of this collection. I never knew you mortals had it in you."
"115740052-0-41516";"Drain fell powers, to the Rim of all Holes."
"115740052-0-41517";"This horde will need to be divided and scattered, or this will all happen again."
"115740052-0-41518";"I'd happily take them off your hands."
"115740052-0-41519";"I wouldn't entrust anyone, mortal or Daedra, with this much power."
"115740052-0-41520";"I feel a surge in the Daedric power. It's gathering."
"115740052-0-41522";"That looks like a you problem. I'll support you from the high ground."
"115740052-0-41523";"May Azura shed a tear for this tragic end to a once-noble order."
"115740052-0-41524";"Hah. Oh, no, it's nothing."
"115740052-0-41525";"Mother of the Rose, we return these wilted petals to you. There. Red Petal Bastion is finally cleansed."
"115740052-0-41526";"Ahem."
"115740052-0-41527";"I haven't forgotten our bargain, Lyranth."
"115740052-0-41528";"Yes, it's here among the rest."
"115740052-0-41529";"Does that satisfy the terms?"
"115740052-0-41530";"This will do, priest. This will do."
"115740052-0-41531";"Does the heathen priest believe he can stand in the way of our divine purpose?"
"115740052-0-41532";"I got this! There won't be much left after I stomp them into paste."
"115740052-0-41533";"Burn for Dagon!"
"115740052-0-41534";"Quake in fear! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-41537";"Need a hand, or two?"
"115740052-0-41538";"I misjudged you three. These artifacts deserve more worthy bearers."
"115740052-0-41539";"Lira, you are failing to shine bright enough. Rise and prove that you deserve that power!"
"115740052-0-41540";"The two of you are amounting to so little, Ihudir. Pull yourself together and fight!"
"115740052-0-41541";"I was mistaken to share this power. To dilute it. Soon I will wield it all!"
"115740052-0-41542";"Martus, we aren't prepared for this!"
"115740052-0-41543";"If a few cultists are too much for you, best give up on the Spire."
"115740052-0-41544";"Consider that a lesson in keeping on guard."
"115740052-0-41545";"This place is enormous, Martus. Where do we even begin to search?"
"115740052-0-41546";"Focus, Lucilla. You can feel the aberrant energies if you just focus."
"115740052-0-41547";"This debris. I feel it. Gods, I wish I couldn't."
"115740052-0-41548";"It's tying my gut in knots."
"115740052-0-41549";"Ugh, there's so much … anguish."
"115740052-0-41550";"That creature. Was it feeding on these? No, there's too much gathered here for this to be some Daedra's dinner."
"115740052-0-41551";"More likely the Dremora were using that creature to draw out this energy, but why?"
"115740052-0-41552";"What even is this power, Martus? It makes me want to curl up and die."
"115740052-0-41553";"It's coming from behind that door!"
"115740052-0-41554";"Another vessel! But this one is drawing in energy."
"115740052-0-41555";"The Daedra didn't bring this baleful energy with them, they're drawing it out of the Dread Cellar itself!"
"115740052-0-41556";"What could have happened here that could produce that much vile energy?"
"115740052-0-41557";"Best not to ask questions you don't want the answers to."
"115740052-0-41558";"We should destroy any more of these we find."
"115740052-0-41559";"You'll hear no argument from me."
"115740052-0-41560";"The blade … remove … the blade …."
"115740052-0-41561";"Damn enchanted blade! I'll need to figure out how they were able to use it to trap me. But first, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-41562";"Cracked acorns, this place is amazing!"
"115740052-0-41563";"Hey, friend! Good to see you!"
"115740052-0-41564";"The Longhouse documents were no help and I still haven't heard any word from my contacts. Our next chance can be found at the House of Whims."
"115740052-0-41565";"Meet me at the House of Whims. It's time to explore the Anchorite's memories."
"115740052-0-41566";"Look here. So much magic imbued in this book."
"115740052-0-41567";"Another of those monsters!"
"115740052-0-41568";"The Dremora! How did she overcome the blade?"
"115740052-0-41569";"Stop it from draining that vessel!"
"115740052-0-41570";"Got away!"
"115740052-0-41571";"We stopped its harvesting, at least, but I feel far greater concentrations of this power ahead."
"115740052-0-41572";"Never mind that! Get in and I'll close the portal."
"115740052-0-41573";"I don't think so."
"115740052-0-41574";"A simple spell will keep the portal open. Mortal, this way!"
"115740052-0-41575";"Is that you, Martus? I thought you'd lost your appetite for screams."
"115740052-0-41576";"A battlemage? Martus, you know him?"
"115740052-0-41577";"Whatever you've gotten yourself involved in, Cyronin, it ends here."
"115740052-0-41578";"Search the area. Leave no stone unturned. We must retrieve the relic they stole from me."
"115740052-0-41580";"Well done, mortal. You found my relic. Give it to me."
"115740052-0-41581";"So this Sister Celdina wants my relic? And she provided directions on how to use it. Interesting."
"115740052-0-41582";"He was responsible for this nightmarish place. You were responsible for this place!"
"115740052-0-41583";"That has no bearing on this mission."
"115740052-0-41584";"We just killed another battlemage! Someone you knew!"
"115740052-0-41585";"I—I wasn't expecting to find anyone still here. This place was closed down."
"115740052-0-41586";"I guess your secret wasn't as safe as you thought. I can't believe you."
"115740052-0-41588";"I will use the Anchorite's amulet as a focus."
"115740052-0-41589";"Ugh, is this supposed to hurt?"
"115740052-0-41590";"Keep going. We are close."
"115740052-0-41591";"No! Please, make it stop."
"115740052-0-41592";"You're hurting her! Stop! Stop this now!"
"115740052-0-41593";"Foolish mortals! You try my patience."
"115740052-0-41594";"This is Fargrave. Interesting. We must find the Dagonists and determine what they're doing here."
"115740052-0-41595";"Curious drawings. Definitely mechanical. But what was that about transforming Daedra? Intriguing."
"115740052-0-41596";"Devastator Rullen? Is that you? We feared the Dremora killed you. And who's that beside you?"
"115740052-0-41597";"After the failure at the Dread Cellar, your Fargrave cataclyst must perform as promised, Celdina."
"115740052-0-41598";"The device will work as intended, Nokvroz. Ah, here comes the devastator now."
"115740052-0-41599";"Come, Devastator Rullen! For your excellent service to the order, I award you with the privilege of activating the Fargrave cataclyst!"
"115740052-0-41600";"Do what you must, flea. Lyranth is ready."
"115740052-0-41602";"The Dremora damaged the cataclyst! Duke of Fire, destroy them!"
"115740052-0-41603";"Shut it down! We must preserve the cataclyst!"
"115740052-0-41604";"Deal with the Havocrel, mortal. I'll open a portal back to Nirn."
"115740052-0-41605";"The energy emanating from the cataclyst is interfering with my magic. We must find a place where I can open a portal."
"115740052-0-41606";"Touch the rune and witness the transformative power of the cataclyst! Lord Dagon's blessing will turn Lyranth into disaster incarnate!"
"115740052-0-41608";"This is it. Madam Whim said the amulet would guide us to Emperor Moricar's soul. Go ahead and use it."
"115740052-0-41609";"I don't think this is what the Longhouse Emperors expected when they made their bargain with Mehrunes Dagon."
"115740052-0-41611";"A wisp! Let's follow it."
"115740052-0-41612";"That looks like some sort of forge. I wonder if it still works."
"115740052-0-41613";"<nervous bear whine>"
"115740052-0-41614";"The—the torturous energies are much stronger down here."
"115740052-0-41615";"Whoever could have guessed? How could you ever have participated in this wanton cruelty?"
"115740052-0-41616";"A hidden door. I think we need to go in there."
"115740052-0-41617";"No one here deserved your pity. Save it for the poor souls being butchered in Cyrodiil."
"115740052-0-41618";"You can explain it to the Spire Council, in case you neglected to inform them of what you were up to here."
"115740052-0-41619";"Lucilla. That will not go how you expect."
"115740052-0-41620";"Did you hear that? It sounded like it came from the furnace."
"115740052-0-41621";"Hail, Rynkyus! We found it!"
"115740052-0-41622";"Report. What have you uncovered?"
"115740052-0-41623";"You were correct. The mortal Dagonists have broken with Valkynaz Nokvroz. They retreat to a hidden stronghold in Deadlight."
"115740052-0-41625";"The furnace door is sealed tight. Why would my amulet lead us here?"
"115740052-0-41626";"Free us, mortals! Now!"
"115740052-0-41627";"Open the door. Your emperor commands it!"
"115740052-0-41628";"The same voice from my memory … Emperor Moricar!"
"115740052-0-41629";"There! The Ravener! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-41630";"Our work is only beginning, mortal. These Incarnates threaten not only Fargrave, but your world as well."
"115740052-0-41631";"Look for me at Wretched Spire in the Deadlands. I have marked it on your map."
"115740052-0-41632";"The Daedra are pouring their energy into that machine!"
"115740052-0-41633";"There are more of them coming!"
"115740052-0-41634";"Over there as well! Lucilla and I will hold them back. Stop that thing!"
"115740052-0-41635";"Take me with you, master! Let us lay waste to your foes!"
"115740052-0-41636";"The door opened! Hmm. All I see is a chunk of slag."
"115740052-0-41637";"Locked and warded against Daedric incursion. These mortals are more resourceful than I imagined."
"115740052-0-41638";"You did well to find this place, Rynkyus. Ah, mortal. Let us confer."
"115740052-0-41639";"Good. I was worried about you out there on your own."
"115740052-0-41640";"On your own? Who is Arox the Mutilator? Chopped Ogrim spittle?"
"115740052-0-41641";"It fled! And … it spoke?"
"115740052-0-41642";"I see the last of the Foolkillers still consorts with mortals."
"115740052-0-41643";"Release us! Obey your emperor!"
"115740052-0-41644";"Before you try anything else, let's talk."
"115740052-0-41645";"I'll ease his pain. See if he knows anything."
"115740052-0-41646";"And I see a Bladebearer who could use a new perspective."
"115740052-0-41647";"I'm ready when you are. Lead the way, friend."
"115740052-0-41648";"Come talk. I want to see what you've found."
"115740052-0-41649";"The furnace ignited! Good job!"
"115740052-0-41650";"You travel a strange path, Lyranth. I won't ally with Kyn such as you."
"115740052-0-41651";"I was not offering an alliance. Mortal, speak to Rynkyus. Tell him about Burning Gyre Keep."
"115740052-0-41652";"Released at last! Who must we thank for our freedom?"
"115740052-0-41653";"Get to it, Atrozu. Find the Ravener."
"115740052-0-41654";"Hold on. Atrozu needs time to find the trail again."
"115740052-0-41655";"This is Deadlight? It feels … familiar."
"115740052-0-41656";"I'm sorry, friend. Look around for anything useful. I want to examine this man."
"115740052-0-41657";"The front door might not be the best approach. Let's look for another way in."
"115740052-0-41658";"This path looks promising. Let's see where it leads."
"115740052-0-41659";"That says Emperor Moricar personally ordered Elegian to design the cataclysts for Mehrunes Dagon."
"115740052-0-41660";"Sister Celdina bore a child to Emperor Moricar because she thought Mehrunes Dagon told her to? That's crazy … isn't it?"
"115740052-0-41661";"Sister Celdina worships destruction because she sees Mehrunes Dagon as a way to repair the design of Magnus—by destroying the world!"
"115740052-0-41663";"We are not property or playthings, Moricar!"
"115740052-0-41665";"Sombren, no!"
"115740052-0-41666";"You are what we created you to be."
"115740052-0-41667";"You wanted a weapon? Then taste my power!"
"115740052-0-41668";"Oh, Sombren, why?"
"115740052-0-41669";"Blocked. But see that tower? We have to find a way to reach it."
"115740052-0-41670";"Hey, friend. We better talk."
"115740052-0-41671";"This looks like an archive of some sort. Let's see if it contains anything that can help us."
"115740052-0-41672";"See the hole? It tunnels right through the wall."
"115740052-0-41673";"You're one of us, Anchorite. An Ambition. Do you know what that means?"
"115740052-0-41675";"You hear that? The Ravener. From the tower!"
"115740052-0-41677";"The mortal appears? Surprising, but acceptable."
"115740052-0-41678";"I will only wait for a brief period at the ritual site after I complete my own investigations. Search quickly if you wish to compare notes."
"115740052-0-41679";"The egonymic? What's that?"
"115740052-0-41680";"That ring looks a lot like the Anchorite's amulet. It might be important."
"115740052-0-41681";"Hmm, a map? It looks like the inside of one of those doomvaults we found. Hang onto that."
"115740052-0-41682";"I think we found everything. Let's figure out what this stuff tells us."
"115740052-0-41689";"Good, you're here! Let's find the spot indicated on the map."
"115740052-0-41690";"Look! Those runes are similar to the ones on the ring. There must be a connection!"
"115740052-0-41691";"Before we go farther, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-41692";"Is this where the Anchorite used to live? It looks like someone else has been here recently."
"115740052-0-41693";"That's … unusual. I have absolutely no idea what that is."
"115740052-0-41694";"Why would the Ravener hide among all these books?"
"115740052-0-41695";"Did he write down anything that can help us?"
"115740052-0-41696";"That's Sombren's diary. I guess he and Calia spent some time here."
"115740052-0-41698";"A strange drawing, master. Does Jynd intend to construct this thing?"
"115740052-0-41699";"All this knowledge—so well-guarded …."
"115740052-0-41700";"Hrmph. Perhaps. But the chaos still threatens us."
"115740052-0-41701";"Do you know why I brought you here, Novice Mairead?"
"115740052-0-41702";"I … I do not, Revered Sister."
"115740052-0-41703";"Because I could not leave you in isolation any longer. You must know the truth. You are the daughter of Emperor Moricar. And I am your mother."
"115740052-0-41704";"We will finish your training here. Do not disappoint me."
"115740052-0-41705";"When Magnus saw the mortal world was flawed, he abandoned its creation. Foolishly, the other gods proceeded and doomed us to suffering. Learn this well. Joy is an illusion. Love is a lie."
"115740052-0-41706";"What became of Magnus, mother?"
"115740052-0-41707";"Magnus watches from the sun, waiting to repair what the others set amiss. You will give him that chance, Mairead. Everything depends on you."
"115740052-0-41708";"I don't understand the lesson of this tapestry. What does it mean?"
"115740052-0-41709";"Mehrunes Dagon stands before Magnus as a weapon of hope. He possesses the power to shatter the mortal world so it can be remade."
"115740052-0-41710";"But a spark within the world is required to summon Dagon's cleansing fire from Oblivion. You, my child, will be that spark."
"115740052-0-41711";"No, mother … I … I can't do that."
"115740052-0-41712";"You dare deny your destiny, Mairead? The blood of emperors flows through your veins. This is your purpose. You will see it done."
"115740052-0-41713";"Time is short. The mask will control your powers, protect you from them. And as long as you wear it, all will forget you. Including yourself and your mother."
"115740052-0-41714";"Thank you, Elegian. I can't do as she asks. I won't be responsible for the end of the world."
"115740052-0-41715";"I will forget you, too, Mairead. But I will leave you with my name. And I'll hold onto your father's amulet. If you ever need your memories, find me. The amulet is the key."
"115740052-0-41716";"This portal will take you to Fargrave. To a new life and a new world."
"115740052-0-41717";"A dead end. But, what's this contraption? Maybe it opens a path."
"115740052-0-41718";"You have my thanks, mortal. You eliminated Sister Celdina and served up Moricar's heir on a silver platter."
"115740052-0-41719";"Her blood will fuel my Perfected Cataclyst. With it I shall conquer Fargrave for Mehrunes Dagon. And after that, your world shall fall!"
"115740052-0-41720";"I should have waited for you … you have to stop her!"
"115740052-0-41721";"Ah, good. Now that you're here, tell me what happened in Deadlight."
"115740052-0-41722";"I've seen this place. A glimpse in my fragments of memory."
"115740052-0-41723";"My amulet … it's drawn to the altar. Can you take a look, please?"
"115740052-0-41724";"That altar and my amulet. I wonder …. Hey, I've got an idea!"
"115740052-0-41725";"If you see any of the items I mentioned, move closer and examine them."
"115740052-0-41726";"Ahh! It's too much! Do you see them? Hurry and take a closer look."
"115740052-0-41728";"Mortals, we have a problem."
"115740052-0-41729";"The prisoner mentioned the Ravener's orb. Where did it go?"
"115740052-0-41730";"That woman is very powerful. And I've enjoyed my discussions with her … what did she call herself? A prophet?"
"115740052-0-41731";"Sister Celdina must be nearby. I'll put an end to this myself!"
"115740052-0-41732";"Portals! I think I'm finally getting used to them. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-41734";"I remember! Mairead! Together we can destroy Nirn and set everything aright!"
"115740052-0-41735";"Set aright? I refuse to be your weapon, mother. I'm here to stop you!"
"115740052-0-41736";"Foolish girl. You do not know what you are—and I do not need your cooperation. You must submit!"
"115740052-0-41737";"You dare turn my daughter against me? You will be cleansed in the fire that remakes the world!"
"115740052-0-41738";"As before, the properties of this accursed mountain play havoc with my magic. Better if you make your own way from here."
"115740052-0-41739";"Others? How?"
"115740052-0-41740";"Let us begin. Mortal, use the memory vessel to capture fragments of the Anchorite's recollections as the ritual progresses."
"115740052-0-41741";"The tincture is ready, but are you sure you want to deal with that … woman?"
"115740052-0-41744";"Just in time, little mortal. Place the root and the tincture in the cauldron."
"115740052-0-41748";"The Xivilai will grind your mortal bones to ash if he scents you here."
"115740052-0-41749";"But I can't let you interfere. Destron, deal with them!"
"115740052-0-41750";"We will investigate the Xivilai, Zynoahz. I will meet you there. If you survive the journey."
"115740052-0-41751";"Sombren, stop! This is insane. We're not coming with you!"
"115740052-0-41752";"Only Mehrunes Dagon can teach us, help us control our powers! It's all in his book!"
"115740052-0-41753";"Destron, come forth! Let my memory of you destroy them."
"115740052-0-41754";"I do not wish to linger here. It has a stench of … wrongness."
"115740052-0-41755";"We will leave this place. I doubt a mortal can survive the trek to Kynmarcher Jynd's territory, but one can hope."
"115740052-0-41756";"I'm doing what's necessary, Calia. For all of us. Your power is better off in my hands."
"115740052-0-41758";"Sombren! Leave her alone!"
"115740052-0-41759";"Sombren didn't expect you to fight back, Anchorite. Well done."
"115740052-0-41760";"What—what did I just do?"
"115740052-0-41761";"We should go, too. I will summon a portal to take us to Fargrave."
"115740052-0-41762";"Stay alert, mortal. You seem to handle yourself well, but Zynoahz is dangerous."
"115740052-0-41764";"Mistress, the adventurer approaches!"
"115740052-0-41765";"My Lady! The Adventurer approaches!"
"115740052-0-41766";"That stack of papers. See if there's anything important among them."
"115740052-0-41767";"I thought Jynd would slice your flesh to ribbons. You are sturdier than you appear."
"115740052-0-41768";"The powers of Oblivion aren't to be worshiped, they are to be commanded!"
"115740052-0-41769";"Two shares of the spoils for me, me."
"115740052-0-41770";"Here it is. But I'm still not sure."
"115740052-0-41771";"I just couldn't lose you as well, Atrozu. You're all I have left."
"115740052-0-41773";"It won't stay drained long. Let's escape while we can."
"115740052-0-41774";"Who approaches? Haven't I suffered enough?"
"115740052-0-41776";"Bah. Weakling. He probably didn't even provide the torturer with much sport."
"115740052-0-41777";"Defective parts, strange scribblings, the inventions of a blind seer. I hope Lyranth learned more in Fargrave."
"115740052-0-41778";"The inventions of a blind seer? Interesting. I believe we know his name."
"115740052-0-41779";"Elegian. That's what I remembered earlier. Lyranth helped me."
"115740052-0-41781";"Elegian? That old lunatic? He was locked in the Blood Pit, last I knew."
"115740052-0-41782";"Did that daedrat … talk?"
"115740052-0-41783";"This pathetic form holds Arox the Mutilator, titan of destruction! Master, let's talk."
"115740052-0-41787";"Daedra don't belong here. This was once sacred ground!"
"115740052-0-41788";"The blind old fool is useless! All he did was babble about nonsense."
"115740052-0-41789";"He is becoming resistant to the elixir, Valkynaz Nokvroz. There is nothing to be done."
"115740052-0-41790";"Nothing to be done? Be grateful that I am not my predecessor, Arox the Mutilator."
"115740052-0-41791";"Ah, Valkynaz Nokvroz. Do you have any idea when we can expect Arox the Mutilator to return?"
"115740052-0-41792";"No! I won't let this happen!"
"115740052-0-41793";"Arox never left. I had him cursed. Turned him into a daedrat."
"115740052-0-41795";"Nokvroz? He did this to me? That bloodless ash pile!"
"115740052-0-41797";"Nothing but a waste of time. Just more of the same. Secure the Durance Vile until I return."
"115740052-0-41798";"Have you completed your interrogation, Valkynaz Nokvroz?"
"115740052-0-41799";"He's getting away! I'll kill him!"
"115740052-0-41801";"I can … feel my people near."
"115740052-0-41802";"My clan still exists. But only as spirits. Atrozu, what should I do?"
"115740052-0-41804";"The blind seer is mad. I warned you, master."
"115740052-0-41805";"That's him. The old man in my memory. Talk to him and see if he remembers me."
"115740052-0-41806";"That bottle smells of Nirn. I hate it, but this ridiculous nose of mine is not wrong. Try it, master. Pour it on the braziers."
"115740052-0-41807";"Taste of spring, Rain's Hand in a bottle. Pour and pour on the coals, helps calm my mental debacle."
"115740052-0-41809";"You seem like a kindly old owl. I wish I could help you."
"115740052-0-41810";"A kindly old owl? I remember … a young girl called me that once. I … I have something for you."
"115740052-0-41811";"Something for me? What is it?"
"115740052-0-41812";"This amulet. I've been saving it … for so long. For you, I think …."
"115740052-0-41813";"Now go … my mind … kind, wind, blind! It fills with a storm!"
"115740052-0-41814";"A sewer, on the east wall. That's our exit, master. We should hurry and return to Wretched Spire."
"115740052-0-41818";"That map was obviously drawn by a prisoner."
"115740052-0-41820";"Mehrunes Dagon provided parts of himself to create the Four Ambitions. These parts make up his egonymic and give the Ambitions their power."
"115740052-0-41821";"Didn't think we were going to survive that. Nearly didn't."
"115740052-0-41822";"Now I shall activate the portal key. There! Step through and assume your role. I shall do the same."
"115740052-0-41823";"It looks like their contraption didn't survive producing that abomination, thank the Divines."
"115740052-0-41824";"So long as this awful place remains, what's to say they won't try again?"
"115740052-0-41825";"I'll see that you're rewarded for cleaning up Martus's mess."
"115740052-0-41826";"This is far enough. I will open a portal out of this place."
"115740052-0-41827";"The egonymic can be used to weaken Dagon, to compel him back to Oblivion should the need to do so arise."
"115740052-0-41829";"All four parts of the egonymic must be used to even attempt this course of action. We will only use it as a last resort."
"115740052-0-41835";"Father, please just hear Noroth out."
"115740052-0-41836";"Faven now? Events spiral out of control."
"115740052-0-41837";"I'll meet you at Annihilarch's Summit. But we should be careful. I expect that both Sister Celdina and Nokvroz may be there."
"115740052-0-41838";"To the base of Annihilarch's Summit, master! Nokvroz must pay for this insult he has forced upon me!"
"115740052-0-41839";"Once again, no struggle. Hrmph."
"115740052-0-41840";"So he decided to act against the Daedra. We should destroy that note."
"115740052-0-41841";"There you are, finally. Now we can begin."
"115740052-0-41842";"This is your army? Were I still in possession of my true form, the ground would shake with my laughter."
"115740052-0-41843";"I was not finished."
"115740052-0-41844";"Now this we can work with! I know a spot where you can open a portal into Dagon's city."
"115740052-0-41845";"Very good, Arox. Come, mortal, we have plans to finalize."
"115740052-0-41846";"Martus, what you've done is unforgivable."
"115740052-0-41847";"I won't be returning to the Battlespire with you. I won't be returning at all."
"115740052-0-41848";"Lucilla, you're one of the most promising candidates in the Spire. You can take another mentor."
"115740052-0-41849";"If this is what it means to be a part of the Spire. I want nothing to do with it."
"115740052-0-41850";"Ah, good. Wake the old dais by matching the stones with the runes nearby while I attune the portal key."
"115740052-0-41851";"Mistress, you're injured!"
"115740052-0-41852";"Nonsense! Merely a scratch."
"115740052-0-41853";"Pay heed to Arox the Mutilator, Daedra and mortals! Make haste to Destruction's Solace!"
"115740052-0-41854";"It lies west of here, where the Sever becomes the Burn. To glory!"
"115740052-0-41855";"Remember, we need to find Sombren so the Anchorite can take his power."
"115740052-0-41856";"Martus, I think you're right. Reporting on what you did here won't result in any justice."
"115740052-0-41857";"What are you getting at, Lucilla?"
"115740052-0-41858";"I'm going to bury you here with your sins."
"115740052-0-41859";"Lucilla. Don't."
"115740052-0-41860";"Don't look at me like that, Martus. Don't look at me like that!"
"115740052-0-41861";"Damn you for this."
"115740052-0-41862";"I did what I must! My own father! Because I believed your lies."
"115740052-0-41863";"Stupid child. Lock him up! We march on the Spire soon enough."
"115740052-0-41864";"He broke free! Grab him!"
"115740052-0-41867";"You are insects. Less than insects! With the power of the Ambitions, soon Nirn shall be mine!"
"115740052-0-41868";"Soon the pact will be fulfilled. My victory is inevitable."
"115740052-0-41869";"What was freely given has nurtured and will be freely returned!"
"115740052-0-41870";"The gates are undefended. Is that normal?"
"115740052-0-41872";"The key is attuned and the dais activated, mortal. Now come and retrieve your portal key."
"115740052-0-41873";"Goodbye my old friend. Thank you for helping me do what's right."
"115740052-0-41874";"The Bladebearers will keep the fortress's defenders occupied."
"115740052-0-41875";"Leave that to your clan, Rynkyus, and come with us. We could use your sword."
"115740052-0-41876";"I will face Nokvroz in open battle, in the sight of my Kyn. That is the path of honor."
"115740052-0-41877";"Well said, Bladebearer, but I will destroy Nokvroz! Master, a word, please."
"115740052-0-41880";"I can practically smell Nokvroz. Hurry, master, we can catch him!"
"115740052-0-41882";"All right Selveni, if you were an Energy Font, where would you be? The northwest? There are a lot of storms there."
"115740052-0-41886";"That scent! Nokvroz came this way!"
"115740052-0-41887";"A passage. Nokvroz went this way!"
"115740052-0-41888";"In here, hurry!"
"115740052-0-41889";"This way! I will gnaw Nokvroz's nose off!"
"115740052-0-41890";"Where is this damn Ravener? Is he hiding from me?"
"115740052-0-41891";"Nokvroz is gone. Curse him!"
"115740052-0-41892";"Search the cave, master. A mortal died nearby. I smell magic, too. Dark and strange …."
"115740052-0-41893";"No need to linger here a moment longer. I'll make us an exit."
"115740052-0-41895";"<urgent, excited growling indicating something>"
"115740052-0-41896";"<loud, short growl>"
"115740052-0-41897";"It may return. We need to stop it from ever finding us."
"115740052-0-41898";"Ravener! I won't let you take Atrozu!"
"115740052-0-41899";"I have enough strength for a portal out of here. Come on."
"115740052-0-41902";"I do not take orders from a daedrat."
"115740052-0-41903";"We're following … your daedrat?"
"115740052-0-41907";"That twisted rod. That's what I smelled! It must be important."
"115740052-0-41908";"The altar! Place the Mother Stones there and we'll be able to locate the statues. Somehow."
"115740052-0-41910";"You found something? It did not occur to me to bother with a dead mortal."
"115740052-0-41912";"Ah! The stone!"
"115740052-0-41913";"Sombren, when I begin the merging, I will need the power of the Ambitions to complete it."
"115740052-0-41916";"Sombren, open the portal to Nirn!"
"115740052-0-41918";"I cannot hold him!"
"115740052-0-41920";"He's too powerful."
"115740052-0-41921";"One moment. I will gather your allies."
"115740052-0-41923";"That was brutal! Is anyone hurt?"
"115740052-0-41924";"The Bladebearers are here, Lyranth."
"115740052-0-41925";"Mehrunes Dagon's assault on Nirn has begun. You have one chance to stop him from taking the mortal world. Do not waste it."
"115740052-0-41926";"We tracked a group of dremora to this point, but could go no further. We did not see them."
"115740052-0-41928";"<urging, pointing grunt>"
"115740052-0-41931";"A wind-gate. Effective for blocking narrow places. See if the key you found by the dead mortal is of any use here."
"115740052-0-41932";"Wind-gate? Bah. My true form could tear through it with ease!"
"115740052-0-41933";"Smart. I just know that the Ravener's through here. Let's go."
"115740052-0-41935";"For the Kalmur!"
"115740052-0-41937";"<pained whimper>"
"115740052-0-41939";"We've breached the gate! Archers, clear a path!"
"115740052-0-41941";"Bladebearers, with me! Show them our fury!"
"115740052-0-41943";"There is our distraction, just as Rynkyus promised. Let us not waste it. To the inner keep!"
"115740052-0-41944";"Curse this wretched form! I once had claws that could tear these walls asunder!"
"115740052-0-41945";"I smell blood. Mortal blood."
"115740052-0-41946";"Watch for blood adepts. They are Nokvroz's most-trusted servants. If we encounter them, the Anchorite may be near by."
"115740052-0-41947";"If Nokvroz harvests the Anchorite's blood, she may not survive the process."
"115740052-0-41948";"The blood I smell, it's not the Anchorite's. She smells … different. Keep looking."
"115740052-0-41949";"Now! Pull the powers of the Ambitions from him!"
"115740052-0-41950";"There are only two stones left."
"115740052-0-41955";"I have the power of all four Ambitions now. It feels like my head is going to burst."
"115740052-0-41956";"Then I shall relieve you of it, Anchorite."
"115740052-0-41957";"Lyranth, what are you doing?"
"115740052-0-41958";"You have done well, mortals, your realm is safe."
"115740052-0-41959";"I consider our venture together a success. But we must part ways."
"115740052-0-41960";"That portal will take you back to Wretched Spire. I have what I need. We will not see each other again."
"115740052-0-41963";"The Anchorite. She's near."
"115740052-0-41964";"I sense her presence as well."
"115740052-0-41965";"There! Bloodlord Zavak, and he has the Anchorite. Let us listen in."
"115740052-0-41966";"Your blood will empower the Perfected Cataclyst and birth an Incarnate to conquer all for Mehrunes Dagon."
"115740052-0-41967";"I'll destroy that device just like I destroyed the Riven Cataclyst."
"115740052-0-41968";"Valkynaz Nokvroz cast down the foolish Arox and purged the Order of the Waking Flame. You will submit, too."
"115740052-0-41969";"Bring her. Nokvroz awaits us in the volcano. And you there, in the shadows—we will deal with you soon enough!"
"115740052-0-41970";"Foolish? When I am restored I will return and slaughter them all!"
"115740052-0-41971";"Another time, Arox. How do we reach that volcano?"
"115740052-0-41972";"Through the door to the north. Soon Nokvroz will feel my wrath!"
"115740052-0-41973";"These are the mighty Bladebearers?"
"115740052-0-41974";"Kneel, Rynkyus, or Valkynaz Nokvroz will erase your clan from existence."
"115740052-0-41975";"Break the rod! Release me to seek my vengeance. I demand it!"
"115740052-0-41976";"As I feared. The Bladebearers falter."
"115740052-0-41977";"The magic is released! Get ready, daedrat. Your final flight is about to begin."
"115740052-0-41978";"Behold the wrath of Arox the Mutilator! Behold your doom!"
"115740052-0-41979";"Arox has returned! Run!"
"115740052-0-41980";"Bladebearers! On your feet! Rally to me!"
"115740052-0-41981";"Come, mortal, I can smell Nokvroz's fear! Take the Path of Cinders and I will help you reach the Anchorite!"
"115740052-0-41982";"Go, mortal! The Bladebearers will aid you as we can!"
"115740052-0-41983";"Three gates bar your path, mortal."
"115740052-0-41984";"Point what remains of the twisted rod at each and I shall destroy them!"
"115740052-0-41985";"Too late, mortal! The Anchorite's blood flows through the cataclyst and soon Valkynaz Nokvroz will emerge transformed!"
"115740052-0-41986";"Where is the Dagonist temple? What exactly did the mad seer tell you, mortal? Did he lie?"
"115740052-0-41987";"Nokvroz used that portal, master. His scent lingers."
"115740052-0-41988";"I don't think Elegian lied. The Riven Cataclyst must be beyond that portal."
"115740052-0-41990";"Valkynaz Nokvroz will come for Fargrave next, Whim. My Bladebearers and I will not wait for that."
"115740052-0-41991";"Drozu, gather the Bladebearers. We must attack Ardent Hope before Nokvroz makes his next move."
"115740052-0-41992";"Our swords are yours to command, Rynkyus."
"115740052-0-41993";"<worried growl>"
"115740052-0-41994";"Rynkyus? Our Kyn! They feed them to a device beneath the citadel."
"115740052-0-41995";"Report, Hadri. What is this place?"
"115740052-0-41996";"They call it Fort Grief. Valkynaz Nokvroz's minions captured us near Jynd's foundry and turned us over to the Waking Flame. They brought us here."
"115740052-0-41997";"Mortal, I will escort my Kyn back to the portal."
"115740052-0-41998";"No, I was so close! The curse reasserts itself. Arox is a miserable daedrat once more."
"115740052-0-41999";"No matter. Arox is still Arox. I am with you, master! This way!"
"115740052-0-42000";"No bonds can withstand Arox's teeth! You are free, Anchorite!"
"115740052-0-42001";"Meddlesome fools. I already have what I need from Emperor Moricar's heir."
"115740052-0-42002";"I am the embodiment of destruction and creation, bound within one mighty form! I am the Perfected Incarnate!"
"115740052-0-42003";"I'll support you, friend. Just like at the Riven Cataclyst!"
"115740052-0-42004";"We did it! Now to deal with the Perfected Cataclyst."
"115740052-0-42005";"We need to destroy the cataclyst so they can't create anymore of those abominable Incarnates!"
"115740052-0-42006";"We actually did it! I wasn't sure you'd come for me, but I'm glad you did."
"115740052-0-42007";"Wait. Do you feel that? Something's coming. Oh … oh no!"
"115740052-0-42008";"Press on and free any other Bladebearers you encounter."
"115740052-0-42009";"Nokvroz underestimated you. You are indeed powerful … for mortals."
"115740052-0-42010";"Ah, I remember you, little one. Moricar's whelp. I have plans for you."
"115740052-0-42011";"Your companions, however, are a momentary nuisance. I shall destroy them."
"115740052-0-42012";"Fall back! We cannot fight Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-42013";"Hang on, I'll get us out of here!"
"115740052-0-42014";"No! We won't let you take us! Not to your damn machine!"
"115740052-0-42016";"These mortals are allies, Dothaz. Tell them what you know of this place."
"115740052-0-42017";"Mortals, make your way into the citadel. I will follow once my Kyn are safe."
"115740052-0-42018";"Oh, Fargrave, how I missed you!"
"115740052-0-42019";"Well fought, all of you. Lord Arox, it was an honor to share a battlefield with you."
"115740052-0-42020";"Yes. Forever they will fear my name, no matter what form I wear."
"115740052-0-42021";"Back to the House of Whims. We need time to recover. And to talk."
"115740052-0-42022";"Walk the streets with pride, mortals. You saved Fargrave. And most likely Nirn as well."
"115740052-0-42023";"But did you hear? Mehrunes Dagon said he had plans for me."
"115740052-0-42024";"Yes, the Prince of Destruction took note of you, Anchorite. You overcame his most powerful minions."
"115740052-0-42025";"There has to be more to it than that. My mother … Sister Celdina … told me I would help Mehrunes Dagon destroy the mortal world."
"115740052-0-42026";"A false prophecy, perhaps? Let it lie for now."
"115740052-0-42027";"I suppose. I just have a feeling this isn't over. Not yet."
"115740052-0-42028";"There is always another battle, but you need not seek it today."
"115740052-0-42029";"I knew I delivered a killing blow. Surprised he made it this far before collapsing. Search the body and retrieve my stolen item."
"115740052-0-42030";"Intruders? Good! You will fall before the power of my newest Incarnate!"
"115740052-0-42031";"I'll kill you all for this affront!"
"115740052-0-42032";"Fools. You cannot defeat disaster incarnate!"
"115740052-0-42033";"Destroy them, my beautiful creation!"
"115740052-0-42034";"Why concern yourself with this? We can outlast the mortals."
"115740052-0-42036";"Stay sharp among the rabble of the Fleapit. They'll have their knives out."
"115740052-0-42037";"I think I understand. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-42039";"The Incarnate's drawing power from the cataclyst! I'll try to stop the flow!"
"115740052-0-42040";"There must be a switch or something!"
"115740052-0-42041";"The cataclyst is healing that thing!"
"115740052-0-42042";"Keep the Incarnate busy! I'll figure out something!"
"115740052-0-42043";"How do I stop this damned contraption?"
"115740052-0-42045";"Rynkyus! I don't know how long Lyranth's portal will remain open! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-42046";"Do not pursue this, Faven. It will fail."
"115740052-0-42049";"It took awhile, but I finally determined your location and opened that portal. Come, mortal, tell me all that transpired."
"115740052-0-42050";"You do not command here, Nokvroz. I take no orders from you."
"115740052-0-42053";"Your mortal hubris amuses me, Celdina, but Lord Dagon has no further need of you."
"115740052-0-42054";"You lie! You cannot create the Incarnates without me!"
"115740052-0-42055";"You do not think so? No matter. I am done with your demands and posturing."
"115740052-0-42056";"The Shambles. Not a place for a casual stroll. Let's go check out the old bathhouse."
"115740052-0-42057";"This is the bathhouse courtyard. See those depressions? Used to be outdoor pools. Let's see if we can find a way inside from here."
"115740052-0-42058";"That's the bathhouse up ahead. Let's see if the door is locked."
"115740052-0-42059";"That's definitely a lucent. They're as common as clay jars in mortal ruins, but only the Daedra actually use them."
"115740052-0-42060";"Place the lucent in the dynamus font and it should fill it with energy."
"115740052-0-42061";"Insert the charged crystal into the labrum and step away. You don't want to get scorched."
"115740052-0-42062";"This device is lost, Celdina. Another failure for you and your order."
"115740052-0-42063";"To the postulates and prodigal returned. Rejoice! You are on the path toward kindling the flame that longs to burn in your heart."
"115740052-0-42064";"As Dagon's hands are destined to cleanse existence with the fires of his truth, we are tasked with rendering all that is impure in your very core to ash."
"115740052-0-42065";"Keep an open mind. For the lies you have been fed will cause you to reject reality's true teachings."
"115740052-0-42066";"You are not alone. I will accompany you throughout every step of your journey. Be diligent and together, we will burn in his name."
"115740052-0-42067";"Postulates and prodigals returned, rely not only on the word and thought—for they can be spun into lies. Trust in the truth of lash, brand, scourge, and burn."
"115740052-0-42068";"The lessons learned through pain are lasting. Master the will to stand in the face of suffering and no torment shall hold power over you."
"115740052-0-42069";"You think the world was a fair place. Think on your own pain. There are infants who have suffered more. How can a world be just?"
"115740052-0-42070";"How can a world which causes you such suffering be just? It cannot. The world is flawed but once it is tempered in flames, it can arise, purified of all imperfections."
"115740052-0-42071";"Postulates and prodigals returned, you come to this step of your journey filled with the painful memories of all you knew before."
"115740052-0-42072";"Those who eschew Mehrunes Dagon's leadership hold the lofty ideology that there is good on Nirn. They believe that one patch of barley in a rotting field saves a farmer from scorn, shame, and hunger."
"115740052-0-42073";"One flower in a dung heap does not improve the smell. Since there is suffering, how can Tamriel be worth retaining?"
"115740052-0-42074";"Break from those beliefs. Work to raze the established order so it can be rebuilt, and know peace."
"115740052-0-42075";"If you have progressed this far, resplendent postulates and prodigals returned, then the spark in your soul blazes ferociously."
"115740052-0-42076";"The Flame you've awoken will burn in many hearths. I know that you will make myself and the Prince of Destruction very happy with your performance."
"115740052-0-42077";"You have successfully burnt your weakness. Continue to feed your doubts to the fire of your fervor and you will not disappoint."
"115740052-0-42078";"Now it is time to say farewell. Should we never meet again, know that I am proud to have you behind me, marching to bring about the age of Dagon. Our time is coming. The flame wakes."
"115740052-0-42079";"Quickly, into the portal before more cultists arrive."
"115740052-0-42080";"That opening in the rocks. Maybe we can reach the caves below and get into the bathhouse from there."
"115740052-0-42081";"Selveni, you've grown so much. You've done your duty by me as I did mine by you."
"115740052-0-42082";"Peace of the Three upon you and yours. As I saved you, you saved me."
"115740052-0-42083";"I have conquered countless of the Princes' chosen and reaped the spoils! Now you will learn what it means to master Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-42084";"It will take far more than that to wrench this power from my grasp."
"115740052-0-42085";"Is this the extent of your power? Because it is not the extent of mine!"
"115740052-0-42086";"Tenacious fools! I will cast your broken bodies from the battlements if it's the last thing I do!"
"115740052-0-42087";"No! Where are you taking me? Divines, please—no …!"
"115740052-0-42089";"You put too much faith in these abominations, Celdina."
"115740052-0-42090";"The air changed, like the storm is about to get worse. We're close!"
"115740052-0-42091";"With the Riven Cataclyst, Fargrave will fall. And then Nirn."
"115740052-0-42092";"Deal with the Incarnate, mortal. I shall do what I can to weaken it for you."
"115740052-0-42094";"Locked. And with magic, damn. If the main door is sealed, let's see if we can get in through the courtyard."
"115740052-0-42095";"It worked! And now you know how to use a charged lucent. Let's see what's behind that door."
"115740052-0-42096";"I see my spell brought the help I requested, but I didn't expect there to be more than one of you."
"115740052-0-42097";"The Dremora again! Well, you're too late. The ritual is almost complete!"
"115740052-0-42098";"Your efforts are futile, fool! Lord Dagon himself taught me this ritual!"
"115740052-0-42099";"Waking Flame, protect the votive runes!"
"115740052-0-42100";"Stop! The ritual must destroy the Daedra! My plan depends upon it!"
"115740052-0-42101";"All that work, ruined. You will pay for that Dremora. You and your companions both!"
"115740052-0-42102";"Release me from this cage and I will grant you a boon, mortal."
"115740052-0-42103";"The House of Whims? That sounds intriguing!"
"115740052-0-42104";"So you're the Anchorite, huh? Neat mask!"
"115740052-0-42105";"Anchorite, Mehrunes Dagon was particularly interested in you at Ardent Hope. We must examine your memories."
"115740052-0-42106";"The Anchorite! You're as bothersome as that damn Dremora! No matter. The votive rune is placed and now you die."
"115740052-0-42107";"You brought this on yourself, Dagonist!"
"115740052-0-42108";"There! A memory fragment. Take it."
"115740052-0-42109";"Another memory fragment! Take it before it disperses."
"115740052-0-42110";"Hey, you. With the glowing hands. We have something in common. If you're not a cultist, we should talk."
"115740052-0-42111";"Hmm. The glow seems to have faded … for now."
"115740052-0-42112";"But what's this? A new face? And what does Madam Whim always say? New faces bring new opportunities. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-42113";"You're not the person I was supposed to meet. What do you want?"
"115740052-0-42114";"Ah. Nokvroz seeks to undermine the mortal Celdina. Two factions, vying for Lord Dagon's favor. Let us hope for rivers of blood!"
"115740052-0-42115";"It's my amulet and my memories, so I'm going with you."
"115740052-0-42116";"Very well. Take the Anchorite and explore this memory. See where it leads."
"115740052-0-42117";"The mortal woman dares command Jynd? And Nokvroz? Arrogant. Why does she need so many Dremora?"
"115740052-0-42118";"Meanwhile, I will begin the hunt for Sombren and Calia."
"115740052-0-42119";"Now take the lucent to the dynamus font."
"115740052-0-42120";"That did it. Look how the crystal crackles with energy. Now place it on the labrum."
"115740052-0-42121";"Our hands … they're glowing again."
"115740052-0-42122";"What a poorly crafted runic crux. Whatever ritual they plan to use it for will most likely fail."
"115740052-0-42123";"The glow. It vanished again."
"115740052-0-42124";"The spell has run its course. The glow will not return."
"115740052-0-42125";"Dagon's blessing reverberates among the votive runes. Soon, a wave of destruction will sweep over Fargrave and destroy the Daedra!"
"115740052-0-42126";"The spell … what's happening to us?"
"115740052-0-42127";"Mortal, destroy the votive runes!"
"115740052-0-42128";"Sister Celdina got away and we're right back where we started. Nowhere!"
"115740052-0-42129";"Nowhere? How quickly mortals succumb to despair. Let's talk in the next room."
"115740052-0-42130";"So you really came all this way to stop the Waking Flame from destroying Fargrave?"
"115740052-0-42131";"Something like that."
"115740052-0-42132";"What happened to this place?"
"115740052-0-42133";"Why, Lyranth, my dear, it would be an honor to assist you in any way I can."
"115740052-0-42134";"An honor, yes. Mortal, show Whim the note."
"115740052-0-42135";"I don't know a lot of things, it seems."
"115740052-0-42136";"I can answer your questions. Come with us, to a place meant only for Ambitions. I'll show you."
"115740052-0-42137";"Let's meet at the Blood Pit. If I know Elegian, maybe he knows me."
"115740052-0-42138";"A noise! Is someone there?"
"115740052-0-42139";"No. We need to stay together."
"115740052-0-42140";"I'm sorry, Lyranth. I need to do this."
"115740052-0-42141";"I'm an Ambition? One of those people Lyranth was talking about? How is that possible?"
"115740052-0-42142";"Its mask. It intrigues. It must become a part of Gazmod's collection."
"115740052-0-42143";"Um … friend … why don't you talk to the Collector …."
"115740052-0-42144";"I meant no insult by having my mortal speak to you, Collector. We merely seek to borrow a Dagonic codebreaker."
"115740052-0-42145";"Since you're clearly interested, I'll allow you to examine my mask."
"115740052-0-42146";"No, the Arox must not leave the gallery. But Gazmod will peer at its mask. This way, mask-wearer."
"115740052-0-42147";"The relic is a … talking daedrat? Mortal, release the vermin!"
"115740052-0-42149";"No. No more visions. I don't want to drink any more! Drink, brink, stink. Ha!"
"115740052-0-42150";"Your pack is perfect, master. And I found the encoded note. I will work on translating it forthwith!"
"115740052-0-42151";"Hey, a little help here! That floating sack of eyes wants to make me a permanent part of their collection!"
"115740052-0-42152";"Thanks. Let's get out of here and return to Madam Whim's!"
"115740052-0-42154";"That smells wrong. All heat and mortal sweat. Trust me."
"115740052-0-42155";"Ooh, bile. Delicious. But probably not what you'd use to clear a mortal's mind."
"115740052-0-42156";"Hmm. That smells like rendered Ogrim fat. I like it, but it might kill the old seer."
"115740052-0-42158";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42160";"Goodbye, old owl. Let's meet back at Wretched Spire."
"115740052-0-42163";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42164";"Sweet freedom, at long last! Arox owes you for this kind indulgence."
"115740052-0-42165";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42168";"Master, Arox has deciphered the note! Daedric troops from Burning Gyre Keep in the Deadlands are preparing to invade Fargrave."
"115740052-0-42169";"Well done, rat. Mortal, find out what else the note contains."
"115740052-0-42170";"That daedrat … talks?"
"115740052-0-42172";"They chased you out of Fargrave once. How many more failures must you endure, Celdina?"
"115740052-0-42173";"Careful, Nokvroz, or perhaps I'll point my Incarnate in your direction."
"115740052-0-42174";"I don't feel so good."
"115740052-0-42177";"The Incarnate failed, Celdina. You failed. Again!"
"115740052-0-42178";"Oh. My head."
"115740052-0-42180";"You see failure, I see opportunity. Let's head to the Riven Cataclyst. I have a legion of Incarnates to create!"
"115740052-0-42181";"Everything's all … blurry."
"115740052-0-42183";"More scratchings? They really are trying to build their own cataclyst, master!"
"115740052-0-42184";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42189";"I'm so used to running off to the next disaster, it feels strange to have a moment of peace."
"115740052-0-42190";"You're not dreaming, but it is odd, isn't it?"
"115740052-0-42191";"It isn't meant for you, flesh-thing."
"115740052-0-42192";"You cannot claim it. Not from me!"
"115740052-0-42193";"Unbound! At … last …!"
"115740052-0-42194";"I'll meet you in Fargrave!"
"115740052-0-42195";"Good luck, you two."
"115740052-0-42196";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42197";"No one's come for this bait in a long time. I've been wasting away!"
"115740052-0-42198";"This treasure will cost you, darlings. The price is blood."
"115740052-0-42199";"The Skein beckons …."
"115740052-0-42200";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42201";"Ah, here for the artifact, then? I have just the thing."
"115740052-0-42202";"Much too rich! But can you handle … this?"
"115740052-0-42203";"Ah, but I had such plans for you. Pity. The artifact … is yours, then."
"115740052-0-42204";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-42206";"I … I know this. A low and constant hum at the back of my mind."
"115740052-0-42207";"A part of me, but also a part of something else. I think that's how we recognized each other, Sombren and me."
"115740052-0-42208";"So, the Longhouse Emperors were not as reckless as I thought. Mortal, I have an idea."
"115740052-0-42209";"And there's the hero of the moment!"
"115740052-0-42210";"It seems the only path is down."
"115740052-0-42211";"Little mortal. Come to take in the view?"
"115740052-0-42212";"You have been quite useful, little mortal. You have my thanks, for what it is worth."
"115740052-0-42213";"There you are! Did you have any luck?"
"115740052-0-42216";"That was a marvelous display of power, Sotha Sil! Only two more stones to attune."
"115740052-0-42217";"I command this strength, it does not command me. I command this strength, it does not command me. I command this strength, it does not command me …."
"115740052-0-42219";"Destroy these intruders and you may earn your place as bearers."
"115740052-0-42220";"The daedrat will be punished for this transgression."
"115740052-0-42221";"This compensation is adequate. The daedrat is free to go."
"115740052-0-42222";"Master, you came back for me!"
"115740052-0-42224";"Very well. Your pathetic sniveling satisfies the demands of the Stricture."
"115740052-0-42229";"Definitely not Nirn. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-42230";"I hear voices up ahead. It must be the cultists."
"115740052-0-42231";"The Dagonists. No better than daedrats, hiding in the bowels of these caves."
"115740052-0-42232";"Finally! Search the camp and find my relic, little mortal."
"115740052-0-42233";"Mortal, a word."
"115740052-0-42234";"Now that that's done … um … my lord, can I have a word?"
"115740052-0-42235";"Check over there, little mortal."
"115740052-0-42236";"I cannot find it! My prey has left Nirn."
"115740052-0-42237";"My minion had better have completed the preparations I assigned her. Come."
"115740052-0-42242";"Look, up there! A lucent! Place the charged lucent in that discharge labrum by the wall."
"115740052-0-42243";"Rally! We can't lose to these heathens!"
"115740052-0-42244";"Am I dreaming? Or do we really have a moment to breathe?"
"115740052-0-42245";"You did well, regardless of where the powers of the Ambitions now rest."
"115740052-0-42246";"I agree. You defeated Mehrunes Dagon, that's incredible!"
"115740052-0-42247";"I have donned my bindings, little mortal. Now you may consider me your prisoner."
"115740052-0-42248";"Stop stuffing your gullet! Madam Whim will be displeased if we do not keep moving!"
"115740052-0-42249";"Even a Dremora of my talents cannot hope to stand alone against the Dagonists and an army of living disasters."
"115740052-0-42250";"It cost you nothing, mortal. As for what I paid, I'd rather not discuss it."
"115740052-0-42251";"We have reached that point we knew was coming. The place where our paths diverge."
"115740052-0-42252";"Wherever I go next, do not attempt to follow. Our paths must diverge, at least for now."
"115740052-0-42253";"The Tribunal, my grandmother, and the hero of Mournhold are counting on me. So why am I pacing out here like a flat-head?"
"115740052-0-42254";"Over here! There's a dynamus font. Let's charge that lucent."
"115740052-0-42256";"I shall never get used to Nirn's smell. Come, mortal. We have plans to discuss."
"115740052-0-42257";"Another mortal? You! Stop for a moment."
"115740052-0-42258";"Atrozu has the trail again. Stay close."
"115740052-0-42259";"What do those papers say?"
"115740052-0-42260";"There you are."
"115740052-0-42261";"People! Daedra! Er, everyone! I'm not particularly great at speeches so I'll get this over with!"
"115740052-0-42262";"Mehrunes Dagon tried to take Tamriel for himself. But we sent his ruddy arse back to Oblivion!"
"115740052-0-42263";"Now, there's one person who's been in this fight since the start of it, and I want to make sure they get their due."
"115740052-0-42264";"Take a bow, you! Blackwood deserves to celebrate its hero!"
"115740052-0-42265";"Quick! Lure it to the light!"
"115740052-0-42266";"Look, Imperial ruins. This must be the Isle of Joys!"
"115740052-0-42267";"It's gone, isn't it? Search the rest of my lair. Find the cultist I wounded before the blade brought me low."
"115740052-0-42268";"The disguise is perfect!"
"115740052-0-42271";"I am with you, Champion! We will defeat them together."
"115740052-0-42272";"The Dremora? Coming here was a mistake, Lyranth!"
"115740052-0-42273";"Disaster is relentless, you fools!"
"115740052-0-42274";"Laughable mortals, you have no power here!"
"115740052-0-42275";"You will be destroyed for your audacity!"
"115740052-0-42276";"Surprisingly competent. For a mortal flea."
"115740052-0-42278";"You dare strike me?"
"115740052-0-42279";"Arrogant vermin!"
"115740052-0-42280";"You shouldn't go alone, Lyranth. I'll join you."
"115740052-0-42281";"How distrustful, Eveli. Fine. Mortal, we will find you when we have word."
"115740052-0-42283";"The Dremora thought to oppose the Waking Flame? Devastator Rullen showed her!"
"115740052-0-42284";"We're almost done here. Then onto Oblivion to see the cataclyst in action. Hail, Dagon!"
"115740052-0-42285";"Keep clearing the path ahead. I want to evaluate this Daedric stone."
"115740052-0-42286";"Steel yourself, Lucilla. We'll only find out by forging ahead. Escort, please take the lead."
"115740052-0-42287";"The cult has made itself at home here. To be expected."
"115740052-0-42288";"These diagrams. They don't depict anything we've seen so far."
"115740052-0-42289";"It almost looks mechanical. Cataclyst … that mean anything to you?"
"115740052-0-42290";"Not yet."
"115740052-0-42291";"I sense more down these side corridors. We'll split up for now. Keep clearing the main halls of the enemy."
"115740052-0-42292";"Protect it! For the glory of Lord Dagon!"
"115740052-0-42294";"More of the cult's designs."
"115740052-0-42295";"He said ""protect it."" Do you think they've finished it? Their Cataclyst?"
"115740052-0-42296";"Likely. Look for anything that might tell us what it is."
"115740052-0-42297";"You, keep going. We'll be able to regroup with you a little farther ahead."
"115740052-0-42298";"Our objective hasn't changed. Discover what the Waking Flame are up to and stop it. We need to keep moving."
"115740052-0-42299";"I have seen enough! I will be free!"
"115740052-0-42300";"Now, little mortal, flee!"
"115740052-0-42302";"Let this world be shattered for the glory of Mehrunes Dagon!"
"115740052-0-42305";"Oy! Over here you giant mudcrab!"
"115740052-0-42308";"Hold on while I summon the power!"
"115740052-0-42309";"This cannot be! Curse you, mortal! I am absolute! I am inevitable! No! No!"
"115740052-0-42316";"Hey, partner! Up here!"
"115740052-0-42317";"The Anchorite ran ahead. I can see a door on the other side. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-42318";"You made it. Great! Come on, Sombren is close. I can sense him."
"115740052-0-42319";"This way. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-42320";"I'm sorry, Elisa. I should have been more careful."
"115740052-0-42321";"Don't. This is my fault. If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't be in this mess."
"115740052-0-42326";"You're here. Ritual starts soon. Tell me what you learned."
"115740052-0-42327";"Agree! Remnant speak to artifacts."
"115740052-0-42328";"Use the vessel to collect the memory fragments when they appear."
"115740052-0-42329";"Remnant inside flames!"
"115740052-0-42330";"Secrets whisper. Explore the skull."
"115740052-0-42331";"Pathways withered. Flew after darkness."
"115740052-0-42332";"Mold dancing in river. Fade the marrow."
"115740052-0-42333";"Ah! Charred reveal!"
"115740052-0-42334";"Blighted stump brings strange ichor. Northwest."
"115740052-0-42335";"Show me what you found, mortal."
"115740052-0-42336";"A cave? I expected the cult to have better taste. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-42337";"Damn it, that was a mistake that may cost us dearly."
"115740052-0-42338";"Let us go, master!"
"115740052-0-42339";"We're too late again, master! Someone beat us to them. Check anyway. Maybe we'll find something important."
"115740052-0-42340";"An intact portal key! If we align the symbols properly, it should open the way to Deadlight."
"115740052-0-42341";"Someone got to these cultists before us, master."
"115740052-0-42342";"That's the cipher we need, master. Perhaps Rynkyus's plan will work after all!"
"115740052-0-42343";"Rynkyus spoke true. This place reeks of the mortal cultists."
"115740052-0-42344";"Now we know where the portal is, master, but it's warded against beings such as myself. Prudent but annoying."
"115740052-0-42345";"We have what we need, master. The Deadlight portal lies to the west, beyond the Blood Pit."
"115740052-0-42346";"You! You need to tell them … oh damn it, it hurts …."
"115740052-0-42347";"The creature is stowed? Then let us move."
"115740052-0-42348";"Go downstairs and rouse the Anchorite. We'll want her with us when we talk to this collector. Meanwhile, I need to conclude our business here."
"115740052-0-42349";"Drat! They've found me—oh! You're not the enemy. Come, come. We must speak."
"115740052-0-42351";"You've subdued it! Excellent. I can reattune this one to recognize you now."
"115740052-0-42352";"Now I can release the Undertaker. It will try to kill you, of course, but you've managed to make it this far."
"115740052-0-42353";"I'll admit, I took a little satisfaction watching you beat that monster to dust. Now I can ensure it will recognize you."
"115740052-0-42355";"That thing makes such a racket …. Well, I can make it recognize you now at least."
"115740052-0-42356";"Tell the Anchorite I'll be at the Bearer's Rest. She owes me and I expect her to honor our agreement."
"115740052-0-42357";"Conclude our business. How I love the sound of that! It makes me all atwitter."
"115740052-0-42358";"I'm not here to play games, Whim."
"115740052-0-42359";"But games are some of my favorite activities, dear Lyranth! Come, let me show you what the House of Whims has to offer."
"115740052-0-42360";"That's the island over there."
"115740052-0-42361";"This portal should get us across."
"115740052-0-42362";"Over here, friend."
"115740052-0-42363";"I knew that ring was important! All right, I guess we enter another portal …."
"115740052-0-42364";"Take the Anchorite and go, mortal. I will follow after I give the Bladebearers their instructions and confer with Lyranth."
"115740052-0-42365";"This enchantment looks powerful! Hey, there's an indentation on the lock. See if the ring fits in there."
"115740052-0-42367";"How dare they pen up my Kyn like feral clannfear? Free them, mortal!"
"115740052-0-42371";"Damn it, they found us! This is not your concern!"
"115740052-0-42372";"Was Madam Whim helpful? Grab a drink and tell me all about it."
"115740052-0-42373";"Time to go, little mortals."
"115740052-0-42374";"To the Collector's villa. As soon as I finish my drink."
"115740052-0-42375";"Go. We will catch up. I want to hear more about the Anchorite's missing memories."
"115740052-0-42376";"We won't let you feed us to your device!"
"115740052-0-42377";"That door should take us into the bathhouse, if we can open it."
"115740052-0-42379";"Mortals! I escorted my Kyn to safety. Now let us find the Riven Cataclyst and punish our foes."
"115740052-0-42381";"I am leaving, Celdina. I am done with you."
"115740052-0-42382";"Then go! Lord Dagon will reward my devotion! You'll see!"
"115740052-0-42383";"Do you think I wanted to kill my own father? I did what you and your cult could not."
"115740052-0-42384";"Quick, my friend! Destroy the core!"
"115740052-0-42385";"No more of this! I think I can release the core!"
"115740052-0-42386";"How are you taking control of the cataclyst? That's not possible!"
"115740052-0-42387";"Over here, friend! No one's come in or out while I've been waiting."
"115740052-0-42388";"Sister Celdina and Nokvroz! They're in the chamber below!"
"115740052-0-42391";"You! I … I'm sorry! Leave me alone! I did what I thought was right!"
"115740052-0-42392";"Don't you understand? I was helping them! The Daedra deserve a home!"
"115740052-0-42393";"A confession. Good. Makes things easy."
"115740052-0-42398";"So this is Nirn? It's so … different."
"115740052-0-42399";"Good, we're all here. You and Rynkyus will lead the assault, mortal."
"115740052-0-42400";"Another ward! I think we can get past this one though. I have an idea."
"115740052-0-42401";"We should be able to find a way inside through the undercroft. It runs beneath the bathhouse."
"115740052-0-42402";"Come, little mortal. We must find the Arox. Perhaps the gallery is beyond that door."
"115740052-0-42403";"No. Never."
"115740052-0-42404";"Ofallo, descend! Kill!"
"115740052-0-42405";"Iliata! Swoop and destroy!"
"115740052-0-42406";"Mafremare! To me!"
"115740052-0-42407";"Kargaeda! Protect me!"
"115740052-0-42408";"Master, be careful! I smell a trap."
"115740052-0-42409";"There! An overseer. Let's see what's going on."
"115740052-0-42411";"Hey! What's happening?"
"115740052-0-42412";"Go, master! I will shred the feet of any who pursue you!"
"115740052-0-42415";"The Collector let slip that they have a codebreaker called the Arox. We must find it."
"115740052-0-42418";"This gallery contains but a single display. See what it is, mortal."
"115740052-0-42419";"Nokvroz is weak. I would have killed the overseer for her failure."
"115740052-0-42420";"Improve the elixir before I return. And forget Arox. He is no longer your concern."
"115740052-0-42421";"The Warden's Overlook is nearby. The entrance is a portal. We might find the location of Elegian's Durance Vile there."
"115740052-0-42422";"There, master! The portal to the Warden's Overlook."
"115740052-0-42423";"Careful, overseer on the left."
"115740052-0-42425";"Look up there. Nokvroz returns!"
"115740052-0-42426";"We did it, he's gone!"
"115740052-0-42427";"Is it really over?"
"115740052-0-42428";"Well done, little mortal. You were successful."
"115740052-0-42430";"I must go. That tiresome mortal Celdina insists on my presence. Improve the elixir before my next interrogation."
"115740052-0-42431";"The power of the Ambitions, she took it all."
"115740052-0-42432";"But the Egonymic worked. We defeated Dagon. We really did it."
"115740052-0-42433";"That's it, the Durance Vile!"
"115740052-0-42434";"I remember the smells of this place. The old seer should be behind a glowing door."
"115740052-0-42435";"So close, but one more obstacle. Any ideas?"
"115740052-0-42436";"Warded. No surprise. Do you have that key near to hand? Have a go at this."
"115740052-0-42437";"Well done. Now, let's see what they're hiding in there."
"115740052-0-42438";"There. The Ebony Blade. Claim it."
"115740052-0-42439";"Hmm. As I suspected. Let's have a look at this so-called artifact, shall we?"
"115740052-0-42440";"Got nothing to say to you, Fyr."
"115740052-0-42441";"Settle yourself, <<1>>, and listen. I can make business very difficult for you if you don't."
"115740052-0-42442";"A seeking spider, eh? I do hope it works. For your sake. In fact, why don't you accompany my partner here. As a gesture of good will."
"115740052-0-42443";"Lady's fangs! Did what you wanted. Cast the spell! Zzavfa. Let's go."
"115740052-0-42444";"I remember! There's a rune of unsealing on the balcony above. It unlocks the cell door, master."
"115740052-0-42446";"Now place the charged lucent in the discharge labrum."
"115740052-0-42447";"And look over there. A charged lucent! Grab it and place it in the discharge labrum beside the displacer."
"115740052-0-42450";"I see discharge labrums on the balcony above. Find some lucents, charge them, then place them up there."
"115740052-0-42451";"In my true form, I could smash through such obstacles!"
"115740052-0-42452";"Good! The sooner we finish with the old seer, the sooner we can punish Nokvroz!"
"115740052-0-42453";"Mortal, I bear a message from Lyranth."
"115740052-0-42454";"Just follow the spiderling. Simple."
"115740052-0-42455";"Keep going. Nearly there."
"115740052-0-42456";"This is the place. Answers behind that door. In you go."
"115740052-0-42457";"What in Oblivion was that?"
"115740052-0-42458";"Great power was just unleashed inside the keep. Hurry, mortals. We must see what's going on inside."
"115740052-0-42459";"Now to deal with this ward."
"115740052-0-42460";"Come, I sense activity in the chamber beyond."
"115740052-0-42461";"Artificer's table. See? Another Ebony Blade's right there. Have a look."
"115740052-0-42462";"Potent magics, Skrix. But all too predictable. Quickly, assistant—use the sundial!"
"115740052-0-42463";"What did you find, little mortal?"
"115740052-0-42466";"Flies in the web! Hope you like the lair, Fyr. You're never leaving."
"115740052-0-42467";"No! Not fire!"
"115740052-0-42468";"Ascendant Order on one side, yaghra on the other."
"115740052-0-42469";"Jakarn, what have you gotten yourself into this time."
"115740052-0-42470";"Don't think you can get the drop on me, whoever you are."
"115740052-0-42472";"Well done, Champion. Now let us put these weapons to good use."
"115740052-0-42473";"Well, well. Look what washed into our yaghra trap. You can surrender, or you can become bait. Choose."
"115740052-0-42474";"We should leave, too. Quickly, mortals, into the portal!"
"115740052-0-42475";"Did you expect to battle my legions? Foolish mortals. I have already won."
"115740052-0-42476";"Relax, mortal, I have you."
"115740052-0-42478";"A glorious victory! Arox the Mutilator must scratch furiously to celebrate!"
"115740052-0-42479";"This place smells wonderful, master. Like weapons after a battle!"
"115740052-0-42480";"Dagon! Please, help me!"
"115740052-0-42481";"This is your great plan, Champion? Throwing pebbles? I will teach you true destruction."
"115740052-0-42487";"Your mortal shell may not survive the climb to the summit, but I will do what I can to protect you."
"115740052-0-42488";"Archers! Let fly!"
"115740052-0-42489";"Sep's scaly hide! That might be the ugliest thing I've ever laid eyes on. Glad it didn't make a meal of you."
"115740052-0-42490";"There's still a lot of yaghra ahead, but their attention is on the order. Now's our chance to slip through."
"115740052-0-42491";"You seem comfortable with the direct approach. I'll keep scouting for signs of Jakarn."
"115740052-0-42492";"Mages, into position!"
"115740052-0-42494";"Can you hear me, mortal? I'm opening a path to Fargrave. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-42495";"The documents described the Isle of Joys as a hunting retreat. They must have hunted Daedra!"
"115740052-0-42496";"Me and the Longhouse Emperors had a very different idea of joy. Come on, let's search those ruins."
"115740052-0-42497";"Remember, mortal, do not range too far from me, else I cannot protect you from the summit's elements."
"115740052-0-42498";"I will not allow you to interfere!"
"115740052-0-42500";"Why are you fighting me? Do you want Destron to have died for nothing?"
"115740052-0-42501";"Yes, Lord Dagon! I will not fail you!"
"115740052-0-42503";"Again. Who hired you to deliver this?"
"115740052-0-42504";"You know, I can't recall. Must have been those knocks to the head."
"115740052-0-42505";"Perhaps a few more will jog your memory?"
"115740052-0-42506";"The longer you stall, Jakarn, the more likely I take what I have and leave you chained up for the yaghra. Think on that."
"115740052-0-42508";"This bridge leads to the roof. Might be a way in over there."
"115740052-0-42509";"That opening in the cliffside. Do you think we could fit through there?"
"115740052-0-42510";"That door leads to the courtyard and isn't warded. Can you pick the lock?"
"115740052-0-42513";"I wonder how many souls are trapped in this place."
"115740052-0-42514";"That worked! The lucent is charged! Now place it in one of the discharge labrums."
"115740052-0-42515";"Hah! You thought I'd crack that soon? I'm Jakarn! The Jak—Kaleen?"
"115740052-0-42516";"Keep your voice down!"
"115740052-0-42517";"That was absolutely not my fault."
"115740052-0-42518";"I'll unbind Jakarn, you deal with the guard!"
"115740052-0-42519";"Ha! Got it!"
"115740052-0-42520";"Very good, master! Not as good as tearing it down and stomping it to rubble, but still, well done."
"115740052-0-42525";"Come on! This isn't right!"
"115740052-0-42527";"Tremble at the power of Arox the Mutilator!"
"115740052-0-42528";"Onward, mortal! These barricades cannot stand against my true form!"
"115740052-0-42529";"Arox is here, mortal!"
"115740052-0-42530";"See how they tremble before us? To the next gate!"
"115740052-0-42531";"The last barrier falls, mortal!"
"115740052-0-42532";"To the volcano! My vengeance is at hand!"
"115740052-0-42533";"Ugh, so the ghost returns."
"115740052-0-42534";"Wait. You can see me?"
"115740052-0-42535";"And hear you, unfortunately. I see you brought someone to help offend my other senses too."
"115740052-0-42536";"Here! This is the specimen we're looking for. Well, in a manner of speaking."
"115740052-0-42537";"Whew, that was rougher than a night at the Ebony Flask, and much less fun."
"115740052-0-42538";"Hey, over here! It's been a while since any cultists went into the Reformatory. How did you fare?"
"115740052-0-42539";"Would if I could, love. Varallion took the letter and medallion when I was captured … and I don't know where my shirt is."
"115740052-0-42540";"Do you have any idea where they were taken?"
"115740052-0-42541";"Either with him or his right hand, Sarydil, I wager."
"115740052-0-42542";"See if you can track down those two. I'll babysit Jakarn, for now, he's in no condition to fight."
"115740052-0-42543";"The exchange is made. Let us begin."
"115740052-0-42544";"Calia and the Anchorite will be safe here. Come, little mortal. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-42545";"I don't think I've ever been to Nirn."
"115740052-0-42546";"Let's go, master! Nokvroz must feel the wrath of my teeth and claws!"
"115740052-0-42547";"A Bladebearer weapon? Here? Examine it, mortal."
"115740052-0-42548";"It is the Bladebearers' crest. This is not their fortress. Why would that broken sword be here?"
"115740052-0-42549";"We are Bladebearers, you Dagonist fools. Free us now!"
"115740052-0-42550";"I'll meet you at the House of Whims. I can help with the negotiations."
"115740052-0-42551";"My body! It's—gone. Again."
"115740052-0-42552";"Jakarn, wait—"
"115740052-0-42553";"See, Kaleen, they already dealt with Sarydil! I owed her a lump or two."
"115740052-0-42554";"Ah hah! She had the letter. No sign of the medallion though."
"115740052-0-42555";"Morah, we have something for you."
"115740052-0-42556";"Oh, a new smell. How inventive."
"115740052-0-42557";"Varallion must have kept it on him. Come on!"
"115740052-0-42558";"If you run off again, so help me I'll break your knees!"
"115740052-0-42559";"Since when are you so concerned about my well-being? Have you finally gone sweet on me, Kaleen?"
"115740052-0-42560";"I'm sweet on the gold I'm owed for bringing you back alive. You can get killed on your own time."
"115740052-0-42561";"So, it's carved in the shape of a sundial? Clever."
"115740052-0-42562";"That is so, yes. When the spell takes shape, the Magnus sigil will glow. Simple."
"115740052-0-42563";"Gazmod sees the intruders. Now we shall demonstrate the power of our collection."
"115740052-0-42564";"Perhaps they will amuse us as our collection destroys them."
"115740052-0-42565";"Coming right up!"
"115740052-0-42566";"Choose a direction. East through Skein Row, through the western warrens, or directly north through the central plazas?"
"115740052-0-42567";"Wait, please, just listen!"
"115740052-0-42568";"Gilfrex sent you to haunt me, didn't he? Dubious hench-ghost! This one is not fooled!"
"115740052-0-42569";"We have a daedrat. Wonderful. Now let's find the Anchorite and depart this place."
"115740052-0-42570";"Ah! Mercy! This one does not wish to become Gilfrex's ghost-slave as well!"
"115740052-0-42571";"Just stop for one moment and let me explain!"
"115740052-0-42572";"I used to soar above this peak. Nothing troubled my true form!"
"115740052-0-42573";"Hold up. These aren't some old soggy papers. These belong to the Ascendant Order."
"115740052-0-42574";"A portal? Curse it, our enemies have already fled."
"115740052-0-42575";"Please, my lord Gilfrex, I just need more time!"
"115740052-0-42576";"Time? I have time. You do not. One day, filth."
"115740052-0-42577";"Looks like plans. Varallion's trying to turn this into a gryphon hatchery for the order."
"115740052-0-42578";"And here I thought they setup this whole hideout just for me."
"115740052-0-42579";"Still not big enough to contain your ego."
"115740052-0-42580";"An excellent idea, mortal. Use the Plaza of Portals to reach the Deadlands. We'll rendezvous at Burning Gyre Keep."
"115740052-0-42581";"Did you hear that? The missing Bladebearers are here!"
"115740052-0-42582";"Is that … a piece of the Ravener?"
"115740052-0-42583";"I know, Atrozu. But we need the help."
"115740052-0-42584";"That little beast killed my guard and nearly bit my ear off! And it talked! They aren't supposed to do that!"
"115740052-0-42585";"My master Nifizzan, the Shadow that Screams Eternal, will not be pleased. Perhaps you've heard of him?"
"115740052-0-42587";"Now, help yourselves to some refreshment while my associates collect the next items up for auction."
"115740052-0-42588";"Over there! More cages."
"115740052-0-42589";"I sense a malevolent power near here. The choker must be close."
"115740052-0-42591";"First the damn sea creatures and now these fools. Mash them to chum!"
"115740052-0-42593";"Over here! This statue has something around its neck."
"115740052-0-42594";"Punctual. That's a first."
"115740052-0-42595";"Trodar! Fetch Krebbin. I need a palate cleanser."
"115740052-0-42596";"Just stay put! My friend is never going to catch up if you keep running off."
"115740052-0-42597";"But that is how Gilfrex catches up to this one too!"
"115740052-0-42598";"I told you. They've already paid off your debt!"
"115740052-0-42599";"My synchroseisia is shifting again!"
"115740052-0-42600";"Hyxo, was it? No need for any hostility …."
"115740052-0-42601";"Well, that makes the risk of bodily harm moot."
"115740052-0-42603";"That's it? What about my dead guard?"
"115740052-0-42604";"Acceptable compensation has been received for the mortal life."
"115740052-0-42605";"Unbelievable."
"115740052-0-42606";"I'm really glad your mood improved before this happened."
"115740052-0-42607";"Give the poor wretch their pet back. Their sniveling is staining my expensive shoes."
"115740052-0-42608";"Yes, yes, I feel adequately compensated and all that. Let's just be done with this."
"115740052-0-42609";"Then the matter is settled. The daedrat is free to go."
"115740052-0-42610";"Varallion! I believe you have something of mine."
"115740052-0-42611";"You are prideful for an errand boy. Come and take it."
"115740052-0-42612";"Oh, bet your arse I w—ow, ow, ow!"
"115740052-0-42613";"Reopened your wounds, didn't you?"
"115740052-0-42614";"Would you take care of Varallion while I mummify this idiot? Thanks."
"115740052-0-42615";"Such pointless courage. Who hides behind that mask?"
"115740052-0-42616";"More and more books. I wish I could burn them all."
"115740052-0-42617";"You there! I bring tidings from the Dread Lady!"
"115740052-0-42618";"Hello? Who's speaking? Wait—Master Rrvenk? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-42619";"<Gibbering, hooting noises.>"
"115740052-0-42620";"I am the master of myself."
"115740052-0-42621";"Mrow? Mrow! Mrow!"
"115740052-0-42622";"Mortal, this is not the way to the summit."
"115740052-0-42623";"I am a master of the Old Ways and the Eleven Forces are mine to command."
"115740052-0-42624";"Using the natural defenses of this place to protect them. Probably Nokvroz's idea."
"115740052-0-42625";"Bend Force! Change! Grrah!"
"115740052-0-42626";"Here goes nothing, which is what I'll be if this doesn't work …. Relax. Let go."
"115740052-0-42627";"I feel it … pulling. Pushing. But I can flow with it! I can align with it."
"115740052-0-42628";"For all this trouble, that medallion better be here."
"115740052-0-42629";"This bag looks promising."
"115740052-0-42630";"Nokvroz! He's here somewhere. I'd know that stink anywhere!"
"115740052-0-42631";"Strange scents here. Something metallic, sharp. It smells of … power. Maybe the cataclyst, master."
"115740052-0-42632";"What did I tell you?"
"115740052-0-42633";"We can pretend this little detour never happened."
"115740052-0-42634";"It's going to take a lot of bribery for me to forget this, Jakarn."
"115740052-0-42635";"I'm sure our friend here would agree."
"115740052-0-42636";"I think I can convince my enchanting lady-friend to provide an appropriate bonus, if we regale her with the tale of our heroics. Particularly my heroics."
"115740052-0-42637";"I'll say you were the second-incarnation of Pelinal Whitestrake if it fills my pockets."
"115740052-0-42638";"I hate running."
"115740052-0-42639";"I don't want to die in this place."
"115740052-0-42640";"Get down! Stay low!"
"115740052-0-42641";"Forward, my warriors! The way to the mortal realm is clear!"
"115740052-0-42642";"No!"
"115740052-0-42643";"Are you sure about this, Bakh? Are we really going to turn ourselves over to the Grasp?"
"115740052-0-42644";"The only thing I'm sure of is if we stay, we'll end up like Minwileth. Come on, let's go."
"115740052-0-42646";"Bakh, are you sure? What if I get worse?"
"115740052-0-42647";"We'll be able to find a way to get you more Redmaiden if we're free. Come on. Thank you, friend!"
"115740052-0-42648";"My prey arrives! The hunt is complete."
"115740052-0-42649";"Destron? Sombren, what have you done?"
"115740052-0-42650";"It dares enter our collection? Does it not know we see through many eyes?"
"115740052-0-42651";"Our collection is as dangerous as it is beautiful!"
"115740052-0-42652";"It tries our patience! This monstrosity will destroy it!"
"115740052-0-42653";"Intruders? Good. I could use the exercise!"
"115740052-0-42654";"Ah, more meat for the grinder!"
"115740052-0-42655";"Halt! The Durance Vile is off limits, mortal!"
"115740052-0-42656";"We came back voluntarily. Did you have to tie these bindings so tight?"
"115740052-0-42657";"I did, mortal. The Stricture is quite clear on this subject."
"115740052-0-42658";"I'm so sorry, Atrozu."
"115740052-0-42659";"Look, the scrying orb!"
"115740052-0-42660";"It no longer amuses. Gazmod has grown weary and departs now."
"115740052-0-42661";"Gykkah, Drozu—stay vigilant. It's possible our clan mates will return while I am gone."
"115740052-0-42662";"I am Arox the Mutilator, terror of the Deadlands!"
"115740052-0-42663";"That Rynkyus doesn't know what to make of you, master. He seems like the suspicious type."
"115740052-0-42664";"Grab your delivery—and a shirt—and let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-42665";"If Rynkyus knew that Arox was your protector, he would be more courteous. My wrath is legendary among the Dremora clans."
"115740052-0-42666";"It must at least mention me? Let me look!"
"115740052-0-42667";"Hey! My gear!"
"115740052-0-42668";"Much better. Was feeling a bit clammy in all this damp."
"115740052-0-42669";"Torches in Skein Row? Liable to set webs on fire. Clumsy. Stupid!"
"115740052-0-42670";"Was such a display really necessary, Celdina?"
"115740052-0-42671";"You required a demonstration of the power of an Incarnate, Nokvroz. Your Daedra will reform. Eventually."
"115740052-0-42672";"I sense … intruders in the keep."
"115740052-0-42673";"Lyranth and her minions. Incarnate, destroy them!"
"115740052-0-42674";"Stupid Sombren! Making us run all the way up this thing!"
"115740052-0-42675";"Over here, mortal. Sombren took Calia and the Anchorite through that door."
"115740052-0-42677";"Go, creature, and look for my sigil. Mark it, and my servants will come to your aid."
"115740052-0-42678";"Onward and without fear, creature. In times of great need I will save you from peril."
"115740052-0-42679";"Along your path I leave tokens of my gratitude. Gather them unto yourself and reap their blessings."
"115740052-0-42680";"Light? What are you—?"
"115740052-0-42681";"Stop! Stop it!"
"115740052-0-42682";"Lady curse you!"
"115740052-0-42683";"No! Put it out!"
"115740052-0-42684";"Well done."
"115740052-0-42685";"A respectable attempt, Skrix. But it will cost you."
"115740052-0-42686";"Seems we're finished here. Meet me outside."
"115740052-0-42687";"Enough squeaking, little rat—oh ho! A few more pests to play with."
"115740052-0-42689";"This one still marvels at the weather here. It's exhilarating!"
"115740052-0-42690";"My resolve's strong. The King of Blood won't break me. I-I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-42691";"Rest while you can. After you see this next location, you may never sleep again."
"115740052-0-42692";"The conduits of energy are opening!"
"115740052-0-42693";"Yes, I can sense the connections."
"115740052-0-42694";"Oh, nicely done, mortal."
"115740052-0-42695";"Sombren is transferring his power to Mehrunes Dagon. We must separate the key from the lock."
"115740052-0-42696";"Free the weapons here and use them to distract Dagon as you get closer to Sombren."
"115740052-0-42702";"It arrives! I shall know its secrets."
"115740052-0-42703";"I've heard the Dagonists have been largely driven from the city."
"115740052-0-42704";"Vri considers this development. The cult's votives no longer affect the mortals of Fargrave, then?"
"115740052-0-42705";"Yes. A relief, to be sure."
"115740052-0-42706";"Vri ponders this with regret. The mortals were more interesting when the cult toyed with their emotions."
"115740052-0-42707";"I just overheard one of the Grasp. Some mad skrids broke into Gazmod's collection!"
"115740052-0-42708";"Vri ponders these tidings and finds them absurd. Gazmod would suffer no such reproach."
"115740052-0-42709";"Doubt me if you like, but even Gazmod's eyes have blind spots."
"115740052-0-42710";"Vri rolls his eyes. Watchers do not have—ah. Vri realizes that you were speaking figuratively."
"115740052-0-42711";"Say, Vri. Who are all these new Dremora in Fargrave? The ones with the big swords?"
"115740052-0-42712";"Vri is baffled by your ignorance. They belong to Clan Bladebearer. Which should be obvious."
"115740052-0-42713";"Is that right? Well, what are they doing here? Some kind of Dremora festival?"
"115740052-0-42714";"Vri struggles to ignore that ludicrous idea. He recalls hearing news of Bladebearers imprisoned in a mortal fortress before they were set free."
"115740052-0-42715";"What madness! Going into the Deadlands, to Mehrunes Dagon's own roost, to spit in his eye! And they survived!"
"115740052-0-42716";"Vri nods, pondering the ramifications. Few beings, mortal or Daedra, could hope to accomplish such a feat."
"115740052-0-42717";"It was mortals and Daedra working together, the way I heard tell."
"115740052-0-42718";"Vri bristles at the idea. Mortal and Daedra working alongside one another … as equals?"
"115740052-0-42719";"You know my friend, the one who defected from the Waking Flame? He says something big is about to happen in the Deadlands."
"115740052-0-42720";"Vri reluctantly decides to take the bait. To what does your friend refer?"
"115740052-0-42721";"No one knows. Or no one's saying. But Mehrunes Dagon is calling every Daedra that can swing a sword to his throne."
"115740052-0-42722";"Vri considers the might of Dagon's collected legions. Little could withstand such an assault."
"115740052-0-42723";"Have you heard? They say Mehrunes Dagon invaded Nirn. But he was banished!"
"115740052-0-42724";"Vri considers the word, banished. He boggles at the power needed to rebuke a Daedric Prince."
"115740052-0-42725";"Some say it was a mortal army, or Daedra, or even the Aedra themselves that banished Dagon."
"115740052-0-42726";"Vri does not bother to suppress a sneer. Mortals invent such fanciful lies when the truth overwhelms them."
"115740052-0-42727";"Master, I sense a deathstone. If you find it, we may learn something."
"115740052-0-42728";"There it is. Touch it and you hear the victim's last thoughts. Enemies make the best deathstones!"
"115740052-0-42729";"I knew that lying Kynmarcher wouldn't release me. Even if I did translate the notes stolen from Sister Celdina."
"115740052-0-42730";"Nokvroz thinks he can make his own cataclyst? Let them kill me! He'll never match Sister Celdina's brilliance."
"115740052-0-42731";"Fool! You cannot stop what is coming!"
"115740052-0-42732";"You cannot defeat me. I am disaster personified!"
"115740052-0-42734";"Another poor mortal, succumbed to the power of the Dagonic votives. How unfortunate."
"115740052-0-42735";"Now, what should we do with Joset? Hmm?"
"115740052-0-42736";"Move, mortal flea!"
"115740052-0-42737";"Be silent! Your Prince has no power here."
"115740052-0-42738";"Lord Dagon will visit disaster upon this ash heap! Mark my words!"
"115740052-0-42739";"You let me die!"
"115740052-0-42740";"I won't let that happen to Calia!"
"115740052-0-42741";"Sombren will save us!"
"115740052-0-42742";"Calia, I'm sorry …."
"115740052-0-42743";"Calnus was scavenging in the Burn and said someone attacked Burning Gyre Keep. It was like a huge storm rumbled through the place."
"115740052-0-42744";"You get hungry enough, you start hallucinating. It's happened to me before."
"115740052-0-42745";"I don't think it was a lie. Havrim knows a scavenger who saw something, too. A Daedra he'd never seen before nearly tore the keep apart."
"115740052-0-42746";"Havrim? He needs to stop drinking from the sulfur pools."
"115740052-0-42747";"Burning dust, boiling land."
"115740052-0-42748";"Shattered sky ecstatic bloom."
"115740052-0-42749";"River source. Hunt the chest."
"115740052-0-42750";"Abdomen exploration. Inner trails."
"115740052-0-42751";"That did it. Now let's see what Elegian can tell us about cataclysts. And maybe my hidden past."
"115740052-0-42752";"Nokvroz mentioned an elixir, didn't he? If you can find one, maybe it will calm him down."
"115740052-0-42753";"Hurry, activate the rune of unsealing before an overseer comes around!"
"115740052-0-42754";"The masked one speaks true. We need charged lucents."
"115740052-0-42755";"You know those Dremora with the big swords—the Bladebards, I think? They're looking for something in the Deadlands."
"115740052-0-42756";"The Bladebearers. I heard it's got something to do with that Dremora lady, the mortal with the funny mask, and their ally. A strange crew."
"115740052-0-42757";"I would never dream of picking a fight with Dagon's forces. But they don't even bat an eye. Good for them."
"115740052-0-42758";"Aye, as long as they don't bring their fight anywhere near the Spire."
"115740052-0-42759";"By the Three, I turn my back for a moment and suddenly there's a small army of those Bladebearers in the Spire. Where did they come from?"
"115740052-0-42760";"I heard they were prisoners in Nirn. Until some mortal climbed Annihilarch's Summit and freed them."
"115740052-0-42761";"And now what? All those Dremora waiting around, sharpening their blades … it's ominous."
"115740052-0-42762";"They're not planning to use those blades on you. Not unless you do something stupid."
"115740052-0-42763";"Looks like it's war between the Waking Flame cultists and Valkynaz Nokvroz's Dremora. Scavengers have seen them fighting all over the Deadlands."
"115740052-0-42764";"Is that right? Seems a bit one-sided to me."
"115740052-0-42765";"One-sided? How's that?"
"115740052-0-42766";"Well, one side can die."
"115740052-0-42767";"Did you feel those tremors? It was the volcano at Ardent Hope. The mountain woke!"
"115740052-0-42768";"The Dremora in town say that Dagon's greatest servant was struck down. The valkynaz."
"115740052-0-42769";"Whoever managed that got through walls of steel and stone to do it. They're a clever bastard."
"115740052-0-42770";"And a marked one."
"115740052-0-42771";"More scavengers are reporting. It's true—Mehrunes Dagon's legions are on the move."
"115740052-0-42772";"Don't tell me they're coming for the Spire? Gods, I thought Dagon wouldn't dare!"
"115740052-0-42773";"No, no! They're marching for Destruction's Solace. Dagon is massing his armies there for something."
"115740052-0-42774";"Here's hoping we never find out what."
"115740052-0-42775";"I never want to hear that again. Mehrunes Dagon himself, roaring from everywhere. I thought my head would burst."
"115740052-0-42776";"But why? What happened?"
"115740052-0-42777";"They say Dagon howled like a dying storm when he was banished from Nirn. That must be it."
"115740052-0-42778";"You mean … someone banished the Prince of Destruction? Incredible!"
"115740052-0-42779";"Yes, Lord Dagon! Your will is my command!"
"115740052-0-42780";"He remembered my mask and this amulet … but he didn't remember me."
"115740052-0-42781";"That's it! Only one energy font left to find!"
"115740052-0-42782";"Oh, what were you doing in there? Madam Whim will be pleased with your iridescence."
"115740052-0-42783";"She is my blood. The legacy of the Longhouse Emperors flows through her veins."
"115740052-0-42784";"You are a tool, nothing more. Fulfill your purpose, or you will be discarded."
"115740052-0-42785";"Now we have to praise Mehrunes Dagon? I … should probably do that. Spare you the embarrassment."
"115740052-0-42786";"Ahem. Lord Dagon? Help us find Nilera and Sovisa so that we can do … evil."
"115740052-0-42787";"There! Those look vulnerable!"
"115740052-0-42788";"Mortal! Take shelter under my shield!"
"115740052-0-42789";"I was trying to figure out how to restore the prison's arcane defense matrices. It should recognize me—or my soul rather—and allow me to make the adjustments needed to escape."
"115740052-0-42790";"It would also help you clear out these invaders more easily."
"115740052-0-42791";"You've already begun the process just getting here. Light the braziers by the orange guardian stone and you'll have reactivated its arcane matrix. Once you've done that, I can revise the spell, but we'll get to that matter in a moment."
"115740052-0-42792";"You restored the arcane matrix of that guardian stone. The good news is I can now activate the stone to revise the summoning spell. The bad news is we need to reset it first by summoning the guardian, which will try to kill you."
"115740052-0-42793";"I'll prepare the guardian stone for activation. You ready some burn salves if you've got them and touch the stone to summon the Purgator."
"115740052-0-42794";"I'll be just outside the gate if you need me. Give it all you've got."
"115740052-0-42795";"Go ahead and restore the power to that blue stone and we can continue."
"115740052-0-42796";"Everything seems to be in order with the Undertaker's guardian stone. I can prepare it for you to activate whenever you're ready."
"115740052-0-42797";"I'll see myself out of your way once it's prepared. I'd really prefer not to be anywhere near that thing when it appears. Especially in my current state."
"115740052-0-42798";"With the last arcane matrix restored, you just need to connect it to the remaining guardian stone. We're so close."
"115740052-0-42799";"The Grim Warden's guardian stone is reconnected. When you're ready, I'll prepare the stone so you can summon it."
"115740052-0-42800";"Just make sure you're prepared to face a tempest of blades or the Grim Warden will chop you to chowder in an instant."
"115740052-0-42801";"You will see! Lord Dagon will devour you and your city!"
"115740052-0-42802";"Raaargh!"
"115740052-0-42803";"All right. I have some control over my emotions. Let's get moving."
"115740052-0-42804";"Here! I'd recognize their faces anywhere! Sotha Sil? May I have a word?"
"115740052-0-42806";"She looked peaceful … I think we did the right thing."
"115740052-0-42807";"She looked peaceful … I think we did the right thing."
"115740052-0-42808";"<Labored breathing.>"
"115740052-0-42809";"You return, creature. Come, free me from my ruin and reap the rewards!"
"115740052-0-42810";"The time is nigh, at long last. Break my chains!"
"115740052-0-42811";"Good. An aperture opens between you and I. Come to me."
"115740052-0-42812";"Yes! All of you now! Quickly!"
"115740052-0-42813";"Ha! Hahaha! At last!"
"115740052-0-42814";"Creatures, you have done well! And all that was yours … is now mine."
"115740052-0-42815";"Cleansing fire, that's a good start."
"115740052-0-42816";"New life breaking through the quenched flames."
"115740052-0-42817";"Wretched Spire? I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-42818";"Let's find this Gilfrex and be done with it."
"115740052-0-42819";"That seems to be what Gilfrex was interested in. I don't envy whoever that Dremora decides to try it out on."
"115740052-0-42820";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-42821";"Mortal, my shield will protect you!"
"115740052-0-42822";"You're chasing Tarvyn? He ran toward the east!"
"115740052-0-42823";"Are you looking for Tarvyn? He ran up the hill."
"115740052-0-42824";"You chase Tarvyn, mortal? Very well. I shall follow."
"115740052-0-42826";"Raaargh!"
"115740052-0-42827";"Intruders! Stop them!"
"115740052-0-42828";"You were fools to think you could stop us!"
"115740052-0-42829";"You're an embarrassment to Lord Dagon and an insult to me."
"115740052-0-42830";"Is there no one in this realm that can give me a beating worth remembering?"
"115740052-0-42831";"A mortal? Yes, you'll do. You'll fight like your life depends on it."
"115740052-0-42832";"Haha … I was right …."
"115740052-0-42836";"Oh … that hurt. You! You saw nothing! Understand?"
"115740052-0-42839";"We will draw Dagon's attention from here. Get to Sombren."
"115740052-0-42840";"Ah, there you are. The doomed leader of this pathetic rebellion. Tell me, are your people prepared for your death?"
"115740052-0-42841";"Mairead. Have you come to fulfill your purpose?"
"115740052-0-42842";"Dagon! I'm the one you want, right? Come and get me!"
"115740052-0-42843";"Grandmother Sovisa … she still looks the same as she did when I was a child. I can't leave her!"
"115740052-0-42844";"Ordinator Nilera. I feel more hopeful even now. Is that the sort of effect freeing her will have on everyone in Mournhold?"
"115740052-0-42845";"Our work is done here. Let's leave before something horrible happens. I'll meet you outside!"
"115740052-0-42846";"Dagon, I cannot do this on my own! Aid me!"
"115740052-0-42847";"No, Lord Dagon! Please!"
"115740052-0-42848";"There you are. So this is where you choose to die."
"115740052-0-42851";"Open fire!"
"115740052-0-42852";"Fear not, little mortal. I am here."
"115740052-0-42853";"Now!"
"115740052-0-42854";"Arise, Sombren. I still have use of you."
"115740052-0-42855";"Ambition! There is still work to be done."
"115740052-0-42856";"Eveli Sharp-Arrow. You will be a thorn in my side no longer."
"115740052-0-42857";"Dremora. Why do you oppose me?"
"115740052-0-42858";"If you wish to die together, so be it."
"115740052-0-42859";"We stand with you, Champion!"
"115740052-0-42860";"We can't keep this up! It's too much!"
"115740052-0-42861";"Anchorite! It is time! Call forth the final piece of the Egonymic!"
"115740052-0-42862";"There! Use the Egonymic on Dagon! I'll hit him with the full power of the Ambitions!"
"115740052-0-42863";"Whew, that was more difficult than it should have been. Try using those on the tree."
"115740052-0-42864";"That's it! The End Times ash begins a new life!"
"115740052-0-42865";"Do you think you've won? That you could triumph over me? Fools! You have only seen a fraction of my power!"
"115740052-0-42866";"Go! I'll keep Dagon busy!"
"115740052-0-42867";"I've summoned a pool of energy! Go into it!"
"115740052-0-42868";"Now mortal, go to one of my energy pools."
"115740052-0-42870";"The Incarnate is almost finished! Bathe once more in my pools of energy!"
"115740052-0-42871";"This was not the agreement. I demand proper compensation!"
"115740052-0-42872";"One mortal is more than enough. My debt is repaid."
"115740052-0-42873";"One dead mortal! I will not accept it. What says the Stricture on this?"
"115740052-0-42874";"The brain decayed rapidly. Forced the Vestige from the shell. The urn dust next."
"115740052-0-42875";"Poison flooded the shell. But from what? Last, the blue plant."
"115740052-0-42876";"Poison beneath the skin. The entry point. We must talk."
"115740052-0-42877";"The Grasp has made its judgment."
"115740052-0-42878";"This flesh is fair compensation. The Stricture makes no demands on its state or freshness."
"115740052-0-42879";"Zzavfa, and curse you, Pynufax! Let's go, wretch. Try not to trip over your own feet."
"115740052-0-42880";"Flesh in this condition lacks the essential traits of mortality. The debt remains unpaid. So says the Stricture."
"115740052-0-42881";"Ha! Pynufax, you ignorant worm. Did you really think the Stricture would allow for this farce? Come on, wretch. I expect payment soon, churl!"
"115740052-0-42882";"There! That is the one! This mortal destroyed my servant."
"115740052-0-42883";"Your servant was a zombie! It tried to bite me!"
"115740052-0-42884";"Silence, mortal! The Grasp will determine your fate."
"115740052-0-42885";"The Grasp has determined a fitting punishment."
"115740052-0-42886";"The mortal shall have its teeth pulled from its skull. Its anguished screams shall serve as payment. The teeth will be destroyed."
"115740052-0-42887";"My teeth? This is insane! You'll regret this, Dremora!"
"115740052-0-42888";"As compensation, the mortal shall take the corpse's place as Kaluzan's slave. A fitting replacement for the loss."
"115740052-0-42889";"What? No, I refuse this!"
"115740052-0-42890";"You would refuse the Stricture's judgment?"
"115740052-0-42891";"What? No, no. Your judgment is beyond reproach. Come along, mortal."
"115740052-0-42892";"You will regret this, Dremora."
"115740052-0-42893";"A tiny mortal stabbed him in the back with a long-knife and scampered off. Said something about keeping his teeth."
"115740052-0-42894";"A Dremora's husk bleeds on my street. What happened here?"
"115740052-0-42895";"I'm afraid he vanished in the crowd. Such a pity."
"115740052-0-42896";"Did you see which way the mortal went?"
"115740052-0-42897";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-42898";"<stinger>"

"115740052-0-42903";"Over here! Did you find the stones?"
"115740052-0-42904";"Hyxo should be along, it'd be hard to miss hi—oh! Well … he's arrived."
"115740052-0-42906";"Webs! Use that torch—quickly!"
"115740052-0-42907";"It appears not all of Gazmod's collection consists of relics."
"115740052-0-42908";"An arboretum? This collection is not at all what I imagined."
"115740052-0-42909";"Perhaps the Dagonic relics lie beyond that door."
"115740052-0-42910";"My prey! I sense it near. Find it!"
"115740052-0-42912";"I—I must obey …. You will not pass!"
"115740052-0-42913";"This is the barbican, master. Go east and then north to reach the inner keep."
"115740052-0-42914";"The Bladebearers draw the attention of most of the fortress, but they will not endure much longer. We must hurry."
"115740052-0-42920";"All of you! Stay away from me! Stay away!"
"115740052-0-42921";"Disaster is coming! Fargrave is doomed!"
"115740052-0-42922";"There's no point. No point at all."
"115740052-0-42923";"Why won't you all just leave me alone?"
"115740052-0-42924";"Something terrible is about to happen, I just know it!"
"115740052-0-42925";"Now stand upon the plates! Focus your will upon them! Release me from this cage!"
"115740052-0-42926";"East through Skein Row, is it? Be wary of the Spiderkith. They consider any mortals who enter their territory to be prey."
"115740052-0-42927";"The western warrens? Remember, while the Errants are basically cowards, they can be dangerous if they get desperate."
"115740052-0-42928";"The Vanquished consider the central plazas to be their territory. We need to be careful here."
"115740052-0-42929";"Bladebearers! Scour the Deadlands for signs of the Waking Flame. Wherever Sister Celdina hides, we will find her!"
"115740052-0-42930";"Master, show Lyranth the twisted rod! It's important, I'm sure of it!"
"115740052-0-42931";"Quickly. Through the door and find the Anchorite before the Collector returns."
"115740052-0-42933";"Ugh, it's too much. I can't keep fighting it. I have to let go …."
"115740052-0-42934";"Lyranth, huh? I'll help you look! Let's meet at the Plaza of Portals in a bit to compare notes!"
"115740052-0-42935";"We'll meet you at the camp."
"115740052-0-42936";"<Babbling.>"
"115740052-0-42937";"Well, of course, it's not so easy to let go of control when your entire existence is in jeopardy."
"115740052-0-42938";"<Chuffing, flapping lips.>"
"115740052-0-42939";"Then I think you have a great deal to learn about the mortal condition. I can share the finer details later."
"115740052-0-42940";"Run! It's coming back! So much blood!"
"115740052-0-42941";"I can't find my family! I have to save them!"
"115740052-0-42942";"Someone please rescue us!"
"115740052-0-42943";"Please, let this torture end. I beg you."
"115740052-0-42944";"Someone kill that beast!"
"115740052-0-42945";"Gotcha!"
"115740052-0-42946";"You're tougher than you look. Soldiers! Soften them up for me!"
"115740052-0-42947";"You really think you're winning? Soldiers! Full assault!"
"115740052-0-42948";"Time to clear you all out."
"115740052-0-42949";"Try dodging this!"
"115740052-0-42950";"Varallion, I have failed …."
"115740052-0-42955";"Take a moment to look around. Sister Celdina departed in haste. Certainly she left something behind."
"115740052-0-42956";"Let's meet at the inn in Fargrave. Bearer's Rest. We can talk privately there."
"115740052-0-42957";"Pssst! Don't just stand there, Scamp-foot. Hide!"
"115740052-0-42958";"The Daedra are attacking! Nokvroz broke through the wards!"
"115740052-0-42959";"Find the Longhouse heir! Valkynaz Nokvroz demands it!"
"115740052-0-42960";"My amulet, friend! Keep it safe!"
"115740052-0-42961";"Let me down, master. I can run from here."
"115740052-0-42962";"Valkynaz Nokvroz! Prepare to meet your doom! Doom him, master!"
"115740052-0-42964";"Wait. See that large vent? We're not leaving without the scoria around it!"
"115740052-0-42965";"You return, and with the idol! Place it here and I shall call forth its light."
"115740052-0-42966";"Mother Kynareth, this traveler has set right the desecration of this holy place. Return to us your blessing and let your light shine over the land and sea."
"115740052-0-42967";"A skeleton! Not Privette's, thankfully. I hope this poor soul didn't die alone."
"115740052-0-42968";"Oh no, Privette! Wait, these aren't sheep bones. Maybe a horse? Poor thing."
"115740052-0-42969";"Tarrinore! Get up, we're leaving while you're still in one piece."
"115740052-0-42970";"Privette's sash! I gave this to her as a present."
"115740052-0-42971";"I've seen sows less stubborn than you! Traveler, talk some sense into this idiot before I do something I'll regret."
"115740052-0-42972";"Stendarr above, did you rattle your brain? We already collected them. Tell her, traveler."
"115740052-0-42973";"Look, a trail of bones! Still not Privette's. A good sign."
"115740052-0-42974";"Oh no, Privette! How could they put my beautiful friend in a cage?"
"115740052-0-42975";"We absolutely must free her."
"115740052-0-42976";"I can't believe what I saw with my own eyes. A talking skull. It can't be…."
"115740052-0-42977";"There is a pleasing breeze in the air. A new peace calming the Keep."
"115740052-0-42979";"Lord Leobert. With this book, he learned to reject fate. With these pages, he destroyed those who were honorable and true."
"115740052-0-42980";"The dagger Leobert used to flay his body. His hairbrained sacrifice brought an end to our glorious order."
"115740052-0-42981";"That chalice was passed down for generations and welcomed countless knights to our halls. Leobert's ritual used it to end us before our time."
"115740052-0-42982";"The heart Leobert ripped from his chest in the shadow of fear. I doubt he cared about the impact this had on the rest of us."
"115740052-0-42983";"Ooh, these are good quality! Tarrinore will be happy to see them. Tarrinore. We need to find her."
"115740052-0-42984";"Somehow I thought Tarrinore would be waiting for me. But we haven't heard her at all!"
"115740052-0-42985";"Tarrinore must've gone down into the depression below. We agreed we wouldn't go down there! What was she thinking?"
"115740052-0-42986";"I don't see Tarrinore anywhere, but those are some of the scoria. Do you think they're cool enough to handle?"
"115740052-0-42987";"Scoria to collect, but no sign of Tarrinore. Slek! Where is she?"
"115740052-0-42988";"This is the last vent I have marked in this section. But there's been no sign of my wife anywhere!"
"115740052-0-42989";"Traveler! You don't appear to be much worse off for going into the Firepot. And that makes two of us."
"115740052-0-42990";"Sweet Privette! Reunited at last."
"115740052-0-42991";"A cave exit is nearby. Come, Privette! Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-42992";"Oh, my dear Privette. I don't know how I could live without you."
"115740052-0-42993";"Tarrinore's water flask? Why would she abandon it—oh no. The rock crumbled. She fell. She's down there!"
"115740052-0-42994";"Over here! I … I could use some help."
"115740052-0-42995";"Tarrinore, what were you thinking?  You could have died!"
"115740052-0-42996";"I … I know I worried you, but I'm fine. See? I just need to rest up a bit."
"115740052-0-42997";"You got lucky. How do I know you won't run head-long into danger the next time we have a job?"
"115740052-0-42998";"Don't worry. I learned my lesson. Next time I'll look where I'm walking!"
"115740052-0-43000";"Let me just slip this on and—aagh!"
"115740052-0-43001";"Good luck, everyone. Remember, the future of Tamriel is at stake."
"115740052-0-43002";"Arch-Magister!"
"115740052-0-43003";"Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll figure something out. I always do."
"115740052-0-43004";"I understand, Valessea. Do what you must to find your friend."
"115740052-0-43005";"Ugh, it stinks in here. This is no place for the lovely Valessea. We need to find her."
"115740052-0-43006";"Thanks. I like your bow, too."
"115740052-0-43007";"That sounds like Abhain Chapel, but only one medallion is there? Hmm."
"115740052-0-43010";"There, it's open. Got any more locks you need picked? How about you, Valessea?"
"115740052-0-43011";"Now's not the time, Jakarn. Let's see what awaits us down in the crypts."
"115740052-0-43012";"You're going to help us? The Eight bless you!"
"115740052-0-43013";"How did you get this rope so twisted?"
"115740052-0-43014";"I can't pinpoint the exact location of Quentyn's medallion. He could be anywhere in here."
"115740052-0-43015";"You know, struggling to get free and such."
"115740052-0-43016";"I'll scout ahead. Maybe someone should watch the door in case anyone follows us?"
"115740052-0-43017";"I'll keep watch. Be careful."
"115740052-0-43018";"Aww. I knew you cared."
"115740052-0-43019";"Oh! Did you see that, Kaleen? What a fight!"
"115740052-0-43020";"Jakarn, focus!"
"115740052-0-43021";"Ow! You trying to tear that hand off, Kaleen?"
"115740052-0-43022";"You have a spare."
"115740052-0-43023";"How many of your heroic plans don't end with you tied up?"
"115740052-0-43024";"There was at least one, I think."
"115740052-0-43025";"Quentyn is our priority, but keep your eyes open. Who knows what the Ascendant Order left lying about?"
"115740052-0-43026";"Here it is, just like I remembered, by the curved tree. The ruin should be at the top of the rise."
"115740052-0-43027";"Ascendant Order propaganda? Don't be taken in. They are not as benevolent as they want you to think."
"115740052-0-43028";"No sign of Quentyn yet, though. We should keep going."
"115740052-0-43029";"This portal will take you to Windhelm. Find Jakarn and use the powder on the medallions before anyone else is killed!"
"115740052-0-43030";"The Ascendant Order has the captains of our missing ships? But where are the alliance leaders?"
"115740052-0-43031";"First things first. Clear the path to the south crypts, please. We must rescue the captains and hope that Quentyn is with them."
"115740052-0-43032";"Hey, that's my family crest on the cover! That's promising. Wish more of it were legible."
"115740052-0-43033";"Damn. Snegh and Brelannal beat us here."
"115740052-0-43034";"Lady Arabelle!"
"115740052-0-43035";"Kaleen, Za'ji, Tsuzo! Thank the Divines you're all right! But where are the delegates?"
"115740052-0-43036";"Apologies, m'lady. We lost our charges."
"115740052-0-43037";"Za'ji is not all right …."
"115740052-0-43038";"Not to spoil the reunion, but we're about to get company."
"115740052-0-43039";"Jakarn, free the captains. Friend, keep the Ascendant Order at bay! Buy us some time!"
"115740052-0-43040";"Stupid thing won't—wait, got it!"
"115740052-0-43041";"Collect Valessea and get the captains to safety, Jakarn. We'll find Quentyn."
"115740052-0-43042";"The knights took Quentyn away not long ago. I think they're questioning him now."
"115740052-0-43043";"Then we must hurry. Come, my friend."
"115740052-0-43044";"Get behind me, squires. Snegh was here first! Hah!"
"115740052-0-43045";"We arrived at the same time, you simpering buffoon."
"115740052-0-43046";"Well, you're still too late. A wizard's magic is no match for the strength and honor of this aspirant!"
"115740052-0-43047";"For Honor!"
"115740052-0-43048";"Down there! It's Quentyn."
"115740052-0-43049";"Let's listen and try to figure out what's going on."
"115740052-0-43050";"A new age of peace is upon us. An age of free peoples standing together, not kneeling to distant thrones."
"115740052-0-43051";"This is not your war, general. What say you?"
"115740052-0-43052";"The war took everything from me. I … I am with you. How can I help?"
"115740052-0-43053";"Valessea must be inside here. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-43054";"Each delegate carries a medallion like this one, Magus. It serves as both an invitation and a key."
"115740052-0-43055";"Oh, Quentyn. I guess you've made your choice."
"115740052-0-43056";"Keep it. We may need your access later. Right now I want you to kill the meddling investigator nipping at our heels."
"115740052-0-43057";"Lady Arabelle? But she's …."
"115740052-0-43058";"No longer working alone. She's found some capable help. Deal with them."
"115740052-0-43059";"Here is your chance, Quentyn. Stop these fools and strike a blow for the people!"
"115740052-0-43060";"Wait! I'm alive! Please, don't leave me here!"
"115740052-0-43061";"You're a godsend."
"115740052-0-43062";"Those Sea Elves would have fed me to their vipers piece by piece until I decoded the documents they wanted."
"115740052-0-43063";"I'm sorry, Lady Arabelle, but I've made my choice. For the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-43064";"Do what you must. We can't allow the general to stop us."
"115740052-0-43065";"I'm getting out of here. If you come across any papers written in coded gibberish, I'd be obliged if you made sure the Sea Elves don't keep them."
"115740052-0-43066";"I'm sorry it came to that, but well fought, my friend. Let's speak outside."
"115740052-0-43067";"Are those the documents we were after? Well, you can give them to Titus. I'm done with all this."
"115740052-0-43068";"The crest on the pommel matches my necklace! This belonged to my ancestor, for sure."
"115740052-0-43069";"Well, what were you going to do if they hadn't shown up when they did?"
"115740052-0-43070";"You do realize that if you weren't my sister, you'd have been on your—stow it, Nari, they're back."
"115740052-0-43071";"Don't think I'm done with this, Titus! You were just sitting here cozy while I was getting raked over the barnacles for those documents!"
"115740052-0-43072";"That's part of the job, Nari. You knew the risks when you signed o—"
"115740052-0-43073";"Hold there. State your business in the Palace of Kings."
"115740052-0-43074";"Oops. Guess that was just one of the risks of the job. Prig."
"115740052-0-43075";"Ugh!"
"115740052-0-43076";"All right … seems like the direct approach won't work here."
"115740052-0-43077";"Hmph. I'm sure I can get this barrier open."
"115740052-0-43079";"Augh! Meow! Meeeeeoooowww!"
"115740052-0-43080";"A camp? Well, what's left of one. Must be getting close, right?"
"115740052-0-43081";"You have what's mine! Leave what little I have or lose your lives!"
"115740052-0-43082";"Hmm. Erlibru doesn't go easy on aspirants, it seems."
"115740052-0-43083";"Wait … that crest is mine, but the necklace is not. Who are you?"
"115740052-0-43084";"I—I—I … I'm Ilyes Maul. Your great great great great grand … something."
"115740052-0-43085";"Ah, there you are. Go inside and talk to Captain Kaleen. Find out what happened at sea. I need a moment to collect my thoughts."
"115740052-0-43086";"That was Valessea! This way!"
"115740052-0-43087";"Don't worry, Valessea! Your hero has arrived!"
"115740052-0-43088";"There you are, good-looking. Did you find the medallions? Let Valessea know."
"115740052-0-43089";"My dockhands are watching for your cargo, Lady Arabelle. They know it's precious."
"115740052-0-43090";"There was a storm off the coast. Perhaps it delayed the ships."
"115740052-0-43091";"Mind your step and don't get caught in the muck. I almost lost a boot over there."
"115740052-0-43092";"I think the trick to this is the pillars themselves. Take a look … carefully."
"115740052-0-43093";"Use the shell and see if a medallion is nearby."
"115740052-0-43094";"Use the shell again, there might be something here."
"115740052-0-43095";"There might be a medallion around here. Use the shell and look for something glowing."
"115740052-0-43096";"A cat's paw? Hmm."
"115740052-0-43097";"Look at the branch there … representing Spriggans, maybe?"
"115740052-0-43098";"A bird. Looks like a forest heron, perhaps."
"115740052-0-43099";"Ah, there they are now! Over here, good-looking! Lady Arabelle, this is the one who helped me recover the medallions."
"115740052-0-43100";"Tarazka! You're looking well, you old cat!"
"115740052-0-43102";"All we've got to do is break a curse that's hundreds of years old. Then I'll get my fortune. It'll all be worth it."
"115740052-0-43103";"Is it done? Is the medallion safe?"
"115740052-0-43104";"Anton, you better be alive to make these splinters worth it."
"115740052-0-43105";"You've got it! Let's talk a moment."
"115740052-0-43106";"Hey, good-looking! Pack your bags, you're going to Amenos!"
"115740052-0-43107";"Welcome back, my dear. We have a lot to discuss and time is of the essence."
"115740052-0-43108";"I appreciate your dedication to this uptight, surly demeanor, but I'm just here to deliver a medallion to Queen Ayrenn."
"115740052-0-43109";"Be that as it may, a ruffian like you will not be allowed anywhere near our queen. I shall examine this medallion myself."
"115740052-0-43110";"Wait, what? The prison island? Shouldn't I get a say in this?"
"115740052-0-43111";"Oh, I know you can't stand to be left out of the action. Think of the stories you can tell of your daring escape."
"115740052-0-43112";"That's true. I guess I'm easy to read."
"115740052-0-43113";"Like a book, dear."
"115740052-0-43114";"My friends, I need your help!"
"115740052-0-43115";"Don't forget that I'm keeping track."
"115740052-0-43116";"Just one more time you had to get me out of a jam, huh?"
"115740052-0-43117";"Sorry, Lady Arabelle. I couldn't find any of the volumes on your list at my last port."
"115740052-0-43118";"No time for books today, my darling. My friend has a favor to ask, so play nicely."
"115740052-0-43119";"Eight give me strength! Of all the sneaky, dishonest …."
"115740052-0-43120";"I hope you've had better luck than I did. The stewards were no help at all."
"115740052-0-43121";"Hello? I say, Langley? Is that you? Help a fellow out!"
"115740052-0-43122";"All right, let's see if we can find that fancy lute. Sir Brenvale probably made it deep into the crypts."
"115740052-0-43123";"The Commodore keeps those old idols as good luck charms, but you have to wonder whose favor he's attracting."
"115740052-0-43124";"Aye, and he claims that crusty old tome keeps the secrets of the seas. Why aren't we all bending knee to druids then?"
"115740052-0-43125";"I said take the idols! Place them how I showed you. Do as I command and we may yet escape this with our lives."
"115740052-0-43126";"Y—yes, sir!"
"115740052-0-43127";"I hope you know what you're doing."
"115740052-0-43128";"We have nothing to fear now. So long as the tome and the idols are safe, the sea will never let death take us for long."
"115740052-0-43129";"Pledge yourselves to the deep and we will rule the seas forever more!"
"115740052-0-43134";"It's Isobel Veloise, Mortens! I'm here with my second. We'll try to help you."
"115740052-0-43135";"Louna! And a friend! Well, you've found me in a small pickle."
"115740052-0-43136";"Gods, it's such a pity to have to pull up on this task. Lady Aurelia is a treasure. Lovely to look at. And so well-connected!"
"115740052-0-43137";"We found your sword, Mortens. My second will pass it to you."
"115740052-0-43138";"The medallion's safe now. Please make sure you get it to the queen. Hey good-looking, I'll meet you at the docks."
"115740052-0-43139";"Let's take this one. The quarters will be close, but I'm a fair hand with an oar. We'll be there in no time!"
"115740052-0-43140";"We've got it! Draigh, let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-43141";"Oh mother. How could you do this to me?"
"115740052-0-43142";"Oh dear. I think he's just over there."
"115740052-0-43144";"Place is a mess."
"115740052-0-43145";"I imagine the Ascendant Order ruffians loitering outside had something to do with that. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-43146";"A few drops of dried blood? Hmm. A scuffle, but not a murder."
"115740052-0-43147";"Hmm. Someone planning to depart doesn't set a meal on the table."
"115740052-0-43148";"The Ascendant Magus did bribe the dockmaster, just as Captain Kaleen said."
"115740052-0-43149";"I think I have a picture of what transpired here. Let's talk, my dear."
"115740052-0-43150";"I feel the lashings that hold me here loosening."
"115740052-0-43151";"The curse must be breaking!"
"115740052-0-43152";"Hmm, no one to greet us. I don't like this. Keep your guard up, good-looking."
"115740052-0-43153";"Free … at last. As a sailor should be. I'd love to look on the sea one last time."
"115740052-0-43154";"Never tie down your sails, Ilyes. Life's too short."
"115740052-0-43155";"I'll live full-sail for the both of us, Captain."
"115740052-0-43156";"Ah, fresh air. Those catacombs were musty as a … uh. As a crypt!"
"115740052-0-43157";"I'll meet you near the old wayshrine just up the road."
"115740052-0-43158";"Go on, I'll catch up with you at the castle's library. It's easy to find: big room, full of books. Can't miss it."
"115740052-0-43159";"I'll meet you at the castle's chapel. The entrance to the catacombs is within!"
"115740052-0-43160";"Let's meet at the tourney pavilion. We'll present the trophies together."
"115740052-0-43162";"People left books open all over the place. How rude."
"115740052-0-43163";"The Shackled Guar is just down the pier. Move, you dirty prisoners."
"115740052-0-43164";"You get them there, you old sea dog, and I'll get them out."
"115740052-0-43165";"I'll do my job, Arabelle. And remember, I like pomegranate wine with my salted mutton!"
"115740052-0-43166";"Find anything promising? Let's chat."
"115740052-0-43167";"All the prisoners are aboard, captain."
"115740052-0-43168";"Two more latecomers, Giras."
"115740052-0-43169";"Hmm … these prisoners aren't on my list."
"115740052-0-43170";"Then add them. I'll tell you about it later."
"115740052-0-43171";"As you say, captain. Get aboard, you scum!"
"115740052-0-43172";"Hurry up, will you lad? I'll need sustenance forthwith, and you don't have much time to make me a meal!"
"115740052-0-43173";"Oh ho! Madam Veloise, you're too late. I'm here first. You cannot pass through."
"115740052-0-43174";"That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before Langley and Berjo arrive."
"115740052-0-43175";"Ah, there you are. Your timing is impeccable."
"115740052-0-43176";"Isobel, you've saved me! I'd better go and take my place. I promised mother I wouldn't embarrass her."
"115740052-0-43177";"Let's get things started."
"115740052-0-43178";"Lords and ladies, men and mer, a knight aspirant approaches the stage! Lady Isobel Veloise!"
"115740052-0-43179";"Proceed, madam. Your second may present any trophies you have won."
"115740052-0-43180";"Together we found the hilt of blade Redheart, lost in a battle long ago. This we present to the Order of the Iron Knot."
"115740052-0-43181";"And finally we present the Oaken Order with the Staff of the Wild Woods, after solving the Wizard Erlibru's puzzle."
"115740052-0-43182";"To the Order of the Albatross, we present the Gilded Lute of Sir Brenvale."
"115740052-0-43183";"The lute of gold, did gather mold, lost for many years. I cannot lie, Brenvale did die, tripping on a tomb."
"115740052-0-43184";"Aspirant Veloise, claiming all three trophies makes you the Champion of the Sapphire Tourney. Come. You have earned a boon from your commander."
"115740052-0-43185";"Lord Commander, I know what my boon will be. You may know, as well. Please release Aurelia from the promise you made."
"115740052-0-43186";"We're almost through the wards, champion."
"115740052-0-43187";"Allow her to make her own choice to marry, or not, as she sees fit."
"115740052-0-43188";"Oh, thank the Eight."
"115740052-0-43189";"Take this, you coward! Look out!"
"115740052-0-43190";"From this day forward, you are a Knight of High Isle. Be brave, courteous, loyal and act with honor. Arise, Dame Isobel Veloise!"
"115740052-0-43191";"You dare challenge me? Fine! Step forward and die!"
"115740052-0-43192";"I cannot deny such a selfless boon. Aurelia is free to make her own choices … within reason."
"115740052-0-43193";"Dame Isobel, I am deeply impressed. I wish to speak with you and your second. Find me in my office, at your convenience."
"115740052-0-43198";"Anchorite! It is time! Complete the egonymic!"
"115740052-0-43199";"Hold fast! Here it goes!"
"115740052-0-43200";"There! Use the power on Dagon! I'll hit him with everything I have!"
"115740052-0-43202";"Ah, good work, my dear! How exciting."
"115740052-0-43203";"That did it!"
"115740052-0-43204";"Lady Arabelle, are you sure you're not injured? Everything happened so fast at the keep."
"115740052-0-43205";"There you are! Let's see if we can unearth the past, shall we?"
"115740052-0-43206";"Uh. I guess. What he said. Sorry Isobel."
"115740052-0-43207";"Shove off, then! This road is mine!"
"115740052-0-43208";"This is it. The old stones, the locals call it. Let's find that hilt!"
"115740052-0-43209";"Stay back! You … you're not one of those slimy druids. Who are you?"
"115740052-0-43210";"No! Not the cats! Arrgh!"
"115740052-0-43211";"You failed again, Lashum."
"115740052-0-43212";"It's not my fault. They're dangerous! Powerful!"
"115740052-0-43213";"Triple the guard on the captured royal. And find the others! I promised all three to the Ascendant Magus, and I won't disappoint him."
"115740052-0-43215";"Zenithar, turn your prosperous eyes upon this laborer's work this day."
"115740052-0-43216";"Zenithar's grace shines upon you, my friend. Your work this day has his blessing."
"115740052-0-43217";"Another fight? Well, if you insist …."
"115740052-0-43218";"I want to help, Lady Arabelle. But I'm concerned for the safety of my retainers."
"115740052-0-43219";"My associate might be able to help in that regard, Lord Bacaro."
"115740052-0-43223";"I think things have turned out just the way they should have. Just be ready to see Isobel less often, dear. A page has turned on our little story."
"115740052-0-43224";"I'm sorry mother. But you didn't break your word. And I didn't get stuck having breakfast across from Mortens or Langley. Yech."
"115740052-0-43225";"You did well, Isobel. It seems as though your second was a great boon to you today. Second, step forward. I'd like to speak to you."
"115740052-0-43226";"They're far more than a mere second, commander."
"115740052-0-43227";"If you'll excuse me, I have to get my things. I want to get ready for adventure!"
"115740052-0-43232";"You there! I'm begging you. There was a shipwreck. The others need help."
"115740052-0-43234";"Get back here you stupid thing!"
"115740052-0-43235";"Watch yourself, stranger. There's some errant magic out here."
"115740052-0-43237";"The corruption spreads throughout the grove. First the plants, then the animals, and now even some druids have been afflicted."
"115740052-0-43238";"There was a fight here. What's that, on the ground?"
"115740052-0-43239";"There's no profit in this. Away with you!"
"115740052-0-43240";"Blast! This isn't over!"
"115740052-0-43241";"Ah, Rayan! And you've brought help. Thank Stendarr."
"115740052-0-43243";"A corrupted shrub. Burn it with cleansing fire after I cast my spell."
"115740052-0-43244";"That medallion has the queen's scent all over it."
"115740052-0-43245";"I'll meet you in the meadow!"
"115740052-0-43246";"The corruption spreads quickly. Burn the corpse while I cast a cleansing spell."
"115740052-0-43247";"Someone used this shelter recently. Their scent is fresh, familiar. This way!"
"115740052-0-43248";"The remains of a fire. There are tracks here. This way!"
"115740052-0-43250";"Might I offer you a refreshment, friend?"
"115740052-0-43251";"There! I have her trail. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-43254";"We're under attack! Seal the gates! Protect the duchess!"
"115740052-0-43265";"Lords and ladies of the court! I dedicate this song and dance to the most buxom, curvaceous, voluptuous of all royals! Duchess Elea!"
"115740052-0-43266";"Why, you … get down from there at once! Stop this nonsense!"
"115740052-0-43267";"This was a warning. No one is beyond our reach!"
"115740052-0-43268";"Stand aside and you will find a place in the new regime. Stand against us, and you will be brought to your knees!"
"115740052-0-43271";"Lord Bacaro, it may not be safe to return to Steadfast Manor."
"115740052-0-43272";"Nonsense. I refuse to hide from these cretins. I'll double my guard, but they won't drive me from my home."
"115740052-0-43273";"Very well. I'll check in with you later. Jakarn, let's go. And put on a shirt, my dear."
"115740052-0-43274";"The high king most definitely … um … agrees. Ahem. Lead on, my foul captor."
"115740052-0-43275";"Come, Caska. Let's go see how much trouble we can get into."
"115740052-0-43278";"We will have your missing nobles by day's end, my lord."
"115740052-0-43279";"See that you do. Magus, summon the Order. We meet on High Isle on the morrow."
"115740052-0-43283";"Green Serpents, attack!"
"115740052-0-43284";"Ha! We got them all, even Caska! Friend, give the word and Za'ji will have you back at Mandrake Manor before you know it!"
"115740052-0-43285";"Looks like this is the place. I'll back you up."
"115740052-0-43286";"Anyone still alive will be in the cages above. Destroy the coral. Make those druids pay!"
"115740052-0-43288";"They knew everything. Who we were carrying, where we were going. But how?"
"115740052-0-43289";"I recognize that one! He was aboard my ship! These lodestones must be how they targeted us with the storm."
"115740052-0-43290";"We are the spirit of the grove. We are the Evergrowth, and we suffer."
"115740052-0-43291";"This druid seeks to help, while another has unbalanced the True Way. Aid us mortal, before the nature that sustains this grove collapses."
"115740052-0-43292";"How … disconcerting. The Evergrowth … hasn't spoken in generations."
"115740052-0-43296";"Seems like my spell is affecting a lot of the creatures around Tor Draioch."
"115740052-0-43297";"This cave is crawling with Ascendant Order knights and vulk'esh. We should be careful."
"115740052-0-43298";"Ah, you made it. Good. I think I found something."
"115740052-0-43299";"The ward is in this cave somewhere. Caves. They always smell bad, especially if creatures live in them."
"115740052-0-43300";"Archdruid, elders, this outsider helped me. And the Evergrowth, it spoke through me."
"115740052-0-43301";"That's one ward restored. Let's go fix the next one, it's in the glade just west of here!"
"115740052-0-43303";"No more. Please!"
"115740052-0-43304";"I'll watch the door."
"115740052-0-43305";"Hah! Rayan! The battle goes well!"
"115740052-0-43306";"The next ward is in the glade, come on, let's hurry."
"115740052-0-43307";"Keep going, I've got this fiend right where I want him! Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-43308";"You're a natural! Maybe you should have been Magister Irin's apprentice."
"115740052-0-43309";"The last ward is south of here, inside a cave."
"115740052-0-43310";"Thank you. I'll find a way to make up for this. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-43311";"No. I don't deserve this. Jakarn, please! Turn me in if you must, but don't leave me here!"
"115740052-0-43312";"The spirit of the grove? It hasn't manifested like that in many generations. Are you sure?"
"115740052-0-43313";"Druid Audrine has never given us reason to doubt her observations. Tell us, child, what did the spirit say?"
"115740052-0-43314";"It warned us that nature was out of balance. That a druid was responsible for this trouble."
"115740052-0-43315";"Out of balance? That explains the corruption. But to blame a druid? I cannot accept that without proof."
"115740052-0-43316";"Then we will find that proof. Friend, meet me at the circle's ritual site."
"115740052-0-43317";"Lower the wards, ghost-knight!"
"115740052-0-43318";"Nay!"
"115740052-0-43319";"Your lady is dead. What does it matter?"
"115740052-0-43320";"Over here, my friend!"
"115740052-0-43321";"Over here, quickly! I don't know when they'll be back."
"115740052-0-43322";"Why must we sit on our hands? The Dominion can crush the Ascendant Order with one fell blow!"
"115740052-0-43323";"I will not allow the Dominion to land warriors on Breton shores! The Daggerfall Covenant will handle this matter."
"115740052-0-43324";"Summon your fleets and I will leave. The Ebonheart Pact will not negotiate under threat of attack."
"115740052-0-43325";"Patience, please! This is a delicate situation. Let us handle this. Now, go with Jakarn. He'll see you to a safer location."
"115740052-0-43326";"That's all the wards! Let's talk outside. I need to figure out what to do next."
"115740052-0-43334";"A map of Castle Navire? The Order attacked there already, but this map shows a river where there shouldn't be one."
"115740052-0-43335";"The Magus must have come here to continue his experiments. He plans to use this power in their next attack. We need to determine the target."
"115740052-0-43338";"This is ridiculous! I knew Magister Irin should have never taken in a mangy cat like you!"
"115740052-0-43339";"Relax, Huldressa. I'm working on it."
"115740052-0-43340";"You better work fast because when Magister Irin—what the, oooh!"
"115740052-0-43341";"All right, that was a little funny."
"115740052-0-43349";"I'll get to work on the traps for the motes! Good thoughts only!"
"115740052-0-43350";"No!"
"115740052-0-43351";"Enough! You will not undo my work here. Die!"
"115740052-0-43352";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-43353";"Coinless mongrels. Come find me at the spire's pinnacle, if you dare!"
"115740052-0-43354";"Ugh … All things considered, that could have gone better."
"115740052-0-43355";"Please, let me help!"
"115740052-0-43356";"No. No, my dear friend. You need to finish what I could not."
"115740052-0-43357";"I have so much left to learn! I'm not ready!"
"115740052-0-43358";"You have been ready for a long time … take my hat, Sir Rayan. And stand as a knight of our order. Goodbye, my friend."
"115740052-0-43359";"Thank you, Madach. I won't … I won't let you down."
"115740052-0-43360";"Curses. The door is now unlocked. The question is, can you make it there?"
"115740052-0-43361";"The grove sings of its suffering. Something terrible happened here."
"115740052-0-43362";"You can hear it? Incredible."
"115740052-0-43363";"Ah, there you are."
"115740052-0-43364";"A summons to a council of the Ascendant Order? This is what we've been looking for. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-43367";"You found your way. Good."
"115740052-0-43368";"That ritual fetish, it reeks of the same corruption spreading through the grove. I wonder who it belongs to."
"115740052-0-43370";"Bones of the earth, spirits of the wild, sing unto your servants. Lead us to the source of your pain."
"115740052-0-43371";"We've done it!"
"115740052-0-43372";"I'm going to head back to shore. See you there, my friend."
"115740052-0-43373";"Look! The spirits have sent their messengers. How beautiful."
"115740052-0-43374";"Follow the torchbugs, friend. They will lead you to the source of the disturbance."
"115740052-0-43375";"I'll meet you in the northern part of the grove."
"115740052-0-43376";"The archdruid? What—oh no, she's spreading the corruption!"
"115740052-0-43377";"The Allwither … it's inside me … forcing me to do as it bids!"
"115740052-0-43378";"Where did she go?"
"115740052-0-43379";"Speak with me, mortal. The spirit of the grove has need of you."
"115740052-0-43381";"Psst, dear! Over here!"
"115740052-0-43382";"Very subtle, Lady A."
"115740052-0-43383";"No matter how many times that happens, I … I am not sure I will ever get used to that."
"115740052-0-43384";"Return to the village and tell the elders what the Evergrowth said. I'll join you momentarily."
"115740052-0-43385";"You couldn't find something a little more flattering?"
"115740052-0-43386";"The idea is to blend in, Jakarn. You both look positively menacing!"
"115740052-0-43387";"They fit perfectly! Now get in there and find out what the Ascendant Magus is up to."
"115740052-0-43389";"Elder Karic, we have troubling news concerning the archdruid!"
"115740052-0-43390";"Slow down, Audrine. Tell us what happened."
"115740052-0-43391";"The Evergrowth confirmed she performed the binding ritual, but she made a mistake. She released the Allwither."
"115740052-0-43392";"The archdruid is responsible for the corruption? And she released the Allwither? The grove is doomed!"
"115740052-0-43393";"The Evergrowth is here and willing to help. In exchange for … certain considerations."
"115740052-0-43394";"Elders, allow us to enter the Undergrove and do as the Evergrowth asks. We can't let the Allwither become the dominant spirit."
"115740052-0-43395";"For all we know, this is exactly what the Allwither wants us to do, but … yes, go. We'll do what we can up here to slow the spread of the corruption."
"115740052-0-43397";"Well done! You actually made it through."
"115740052-0-43398";"Lady Arabelle was right, this looks like the place. Probably behind that door."
"115740052-0-43399";"New recruits must wait outside. The Magus will address you later."
"115740052-0-43400";"That's not fair! We want to attend the main meeting!"
"115740052-0-43401";"An old druid circle? Here? How did I not know of this?"
"115740052-0-43402";"Errant magicka still lingers. A powerful spell was cast here. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-43403";"That stone possessed ancient energy, but more akin to Valessea's magic than mine."
"115740052-0-43404";"A cracked staff? That can occur when the caster can't contain the magic they attempt to wield."
"115740052-0-43407";"Our ships are ready, my lord. We can attack All Flags Islet on your command."
"115740052-0-43408";"And you can control the druid magic? It will take great power to breach the keep's defenses. We cannot afford another mishap."
"115740052-0-43409";"I can, my lord. The alliance leaders will have nowhere to hide after I tear down their walls."
"115740052-0-43410";"Go, then. Begin the attack."
"115740052-0-43412";"They know we took the royals to All Flags? And the Magus has ships ready to attack? We can't let him get away! Try the door to the right!"
"115740052-0-43413";"Magical wards bind the spirit to the grove. We need to find those wards, cleanse them, and destroy them."
"115740052-0-43414";"There you are! And making quick work of those motes, too."
"115740052-0-43415";"Take the items back to Mandrake Manor, my friend. I can do a more thorough examination there."
"115740052-0-43416";"Ryvana, if you'll allow me, I believe I can help you dispel the lingering disturbance."
"115740052-0-43417";"My circle and I thank you, Valessea."
"115740052-0-43418";"Look at that, an underground river! But I don't see the Magus. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-43419";"I'll cleanse the wards. Then you destroy them."
"115740052-0-43420";"*howl*"
"115740052-0-43421";"Hey, partner, over here!"
"115740052-0-43422";"Either pick yourselves off the ground or let me carry you. We're getting out of here, Sergeant Brusic's waiting."
"115740052-0-43423";"I do not sense any additional wards out here. The central chamber should now be accessible. Let us go and set the spirit free."
"115740052-0-43424";"The final ward is somewhere in here. Find it and destroy it!"
"115740052-0-43425";"You have destroyed the corrupted wards and our strength returns. Balance shall be restored to the grove."
"115740052-0-43426";"Let's return to the village and tell the elders the good news!"
"115740052-0-43428";"Thank you, spirit of the grove. Adventurer, the Evergrowth wants to talk to you."
"115740052-0-43429";"The Evergrowth says the grove is safe now. It will continue to perform its sacred duty."
"115740052-0-43430";"For now. I just hope we don't regret removing the binding wards. I guess we'll have to wait and see."
"115740052-0-43431";"Adventurer, may we speak?"
"115740052-0-43432";"I always wanted to climb those guard towers. Father never let me."
"115740052-0-43433";"I once hid from my escorts for three hours in that tree's hollow."
"115740052-0-43434";"There it is. Brokerock Mine. I hope father is pleased to see me."
"115740052-0-43436";"Ah, hero! If you had any interest in the sea, I would take you on in a heartbeat!"
"115740052-0-43438";"Breton? I'm a Breton. Who are you?"
"115740052-0-43439";"Did you leave your mother back at Amenos Station? No. Absolutely not."
"115740052-0-43440";"I cannot have you getting underfoot. Go to your room."
"115740052-0-43441";"I bring an adventurer to help—father—and you send me to my room? Ugh!"
"115740052-0-43442";"Why couldn't Meryline stay with her mother? I don't have any sentries to spare on her protection."
"115740052-0-43443";"There you are! It's about time!"
"115740052-0-43444";"Ah, did Lady Arabelle send you? Look! I think I found her!"
"115740052-0-43445";"You check the hull and I will search among the wreckage. Be careful."
"115740052-0-43446";"Stay back … I can still fight!"
"115740052-0-43447";"Islinne! Friend, this is my boatswain. There is none finer!"
"115740052-0-43448";"Captain! Thank Kyne it's you."
"115740052-0-43450";"Ugh … my head. Who are you? Did Seraphyne send you?"
"115740052-0-43451";"Everything's going to be fine. Come to the manor. Perhaps I can help you."
"115740052-0-43452";"Roslenn, right? I am … so, so sorry about this. If I hadn't been so weak, I would have …."
"115740052-0-43453";"Alexis Viralaine, I swear by the Society of the Steadfast, you will answer for your crimes."
"115740052-0-43454";"I had to do it, Roslenn! It was the only way to guarantee their recovery!"
"115740052-0-43455";"You were poisoning them, Alexis! Look around you!"
"115740052-0-43456";"Sorry, Mender. It's uh, closed for cleaning. Don't worry, I'll let you know when it's open again. Shouldn't be long."
"115740052-0-43457";"Your conversation distracted father long enough for me to escape out the front door!"
"115740052-0-43458";"<Baaaa!>"
"115740052-0-43459";"The trail the caravans use is just up ahead. Maybe we'll be able to see where they are from there."
"115740052-0-43462";"<Mrrrhhh?>"
"115740052-0-43463";"Resonance crystals? The caravan? Where is everyone?"
"115740052-0-43464";"<Muurrhhh! Mooo!>"
"115740052-0-43465";"<Moo?>"
"115740052-0-43466";"Lady Arabelle's hounds. Did you think you could sniff around undetected?"
"115740052-0-43467";"Help … me!"
"115740052-0-43468";"Gisele? Darric? No no no no no."
"115740052-0-43469";"There she is! My girl is still in one piece. Moons be praised! Let's talk this over."
"115740052-0-43470";"You bastard! What have you done with Lady Arabelle?"
"115740052-0-43471";"I wish we could chat longer, but the tide waits for no one! Do give Lady Arabelle my regards."
"115740052-0-43472";"We part company here, I think. I'll get into position and await your signal. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-43473";"You'll be careful with that kindlepitch, right? I'll meet you with the others soon!"
"115740052-0-43474";"Not you again! You haven't paid your bill. Or did you forget that too?"
"115740052-0-43475";"See? I was here and she remembers me! I must have committed great diplomacy last night. Ask her about my scepter, friend."
"115740052-0-43476";"There you are, dears. Why, Jakarn! You look positively panicked. What's wrong?"
"115740052-0-43478";"What does this stuff do again?"
"115740052-0-43479";"It's kindlepitch, and it's highly explosive! Make sure you don't drop any."
"115740052-0-43480";"Do you take me for a clumsy fool? I won't drop …. Uh oh …."
"115740052-0-43481";"What did you do? You idiot! I told you kindlepitch is highly explos—"
"115740052-0-43482";"Count Damard? Why, no. Duchess Elea, however, is touring the Silver Swan. She does not wish to be disturbed. Good day."
"115740052-0-43483";"The steward is definitely hiding something. Look for a launch at the end of the pier to take us to the Swan."
"115740052-0-43484";"We have no time to be delayed by silly formalities. Dear, please reason with the steward!"
"115740052-0-43490";"Curse your meddling! For the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-43491";"Someone, please help! They locked me in my cabin!"
"115740052-0-43492";"My own steward turned against me! He had the audacity to lock me in my own cabin!"
"115740052-0-43493";"Search the cabin, dear. Find that letter."
"115740052-0-43494";"You found Damard's letter? What does it say?"
"115740052-0-43495";"Oh good, you have the supplies. I'm nearly done here as well."
"115740052-0-43497";"<Hadolid rumbles calmly.>"
"115740052-0-43498";"Aaaah! Look! On the ridge! There!"
"115740052-0-43499";"I assume Huldressa is back to her charming self? I've run into a problem."
"115740052-0-43500";"Give me just a moment to pick the lock."
"115740052-0-43501";"All right, let's get in and out as quick as we can."
"115740052-0-43502";"I'll catch up to you once the song's done."
"115740052-0-43505";"That's it, you got it! Now let's get out of here before I set off something else!"
"115740052-0-43506";"Magister Irin really didn't want me getting in there, huh? I have to admire the dedication."
"115740052-0-43508";"The ritual circle is just up the hill. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-43509";"Things are pretty restless up here. Watch yourself."
"115740052-0-43510";"Stay here, I'll run up to the altar and get the celebration started."
"115740052-0-43511";"I did it! Start running, it's going to happen fast!"
"115740052-0-43512";"Zenithar, we have toiled, traded, and talked. Please accept our offering as a sign that your teachings reached our humble ears."
"115740052-0-43514";"It worked! And it was nice and loud too!"
"115740052-0-43515";"Let's meet back at the tower and make sure everything is all right."
"115740052-0-43516";"You know of a way down into the cove, right? One that does not involve us falling to our deaths?"
"115740052-0-43517";"Can you believe this cat, Wat—? Oh, right. He's back home. Look, of course I know the way. I'll get you down there pretty as you please!"
"115740052-0-43518";"They dragged him into the mine? No time to lose, friend!"
"115740052-0-43519";"The Hadolids attacked? What happened?"
"115740052-0-43520";"I refuse to work under these conditions! I was turned into a guar! A guar!"
"115740052-0-43521";"Of course, Huldressa. I promise to address the situation."
"115740052-0-43522";"See that you do."
"115740052-0-43523";"Huldressa sold me out, didn't she?"
"115740052-0-43524";"Let me speak to your associate first, Ember."
"115740052-0-43525";"Hey, you, let's talk while Magister Irin collects his thoughts."
"115740052-0-43526";"Magister Irin, I'm grateful for your teachings. And your patience. But I think it's time for me to move on."
"115740052-0-43528";"Finally! I get to help someone."
"115740052-0-43530";"Fish biscuits! That wasn't right."
"115740052-0-43531";"Did you hear that? It sounded like it was coming from in here."
"115740052-0-43532";"One distraction coming right up!"
"115740052-0-43533";"Yvelle! Stendarr blind me. What happened?"
"115740052-0-43534";"Meryline? You can't be in—the Hadolids, they're coming back for us!"
"115740052-0-43535";"Yvelle, you're in no state to fight. Adventurer, we need a plan."
"115740052-0-43536";"I'll keep the Hadolids at bay. Patch up Yvelle and the others."
"115740052-0-43538";"Was I … was I just a guar?"
"115740052-0-43539";"The Hadolids are leaving!"
"115740052-0-43540";"Meryline? That song—the Hadolids aren't trying to get in anymore?"
"115740052-0-43541";"It worked! Friend, check in with Yvelle. I need to catch my breath."
"115740052-0-43542";"Father can't be far. Let's go!"
"115740052-0-43543";"That's a piece of father's cloak! We're definitely on the right path."
"115740052-0-43544";"That's father's dagger. He came this way!"
"115740052-0-43545";"Achane? He … he was one of father's personal guards. We need to find father. Quickly."
"115740052-0-43546";"That's father's voice!"
"115740052-0-43547";"Father! Are you hurt? Where are the Hadolids?"
"115740052-0-43548";"Meryline? You're supposed to be safely outside. Adventurer, come here."
"115740052-0-43549";"I am safe! And you'd better be thanking my friend for seeing to that."
"115740052-0-43550";"Father, we're going in to deal with the Hadolids."
"115740052-0-43551";"Leave the Hadolids in the hands of a capable adventurer. You're staying with me."
"115740052-0-43552";"I won't let my friend face the Hadolids alone!"
"115740052-0-43553";"Young lady, you will listen to your father!"
"115740052-0-43554";"I fared better against the Hadolids than you or anyone else!"
"115740052-0-43555";"I'm going deeper into the mine. You can make it out on your own."
"115740052-0-43556";"Ha! Fine sailing, my friend! First rate!"
"115740052-0-43557";"Truly? Mara's mercy, it would be good to get off this rock. But … my crew …."
"115740052-0-43558";"You were a real help out there, Adwig. I could use a smelly, resourceful Breton on the Prowler."
"115740052-0-43559";"You're right, Jimila. Donel and Watkins can see to the others. It's time. Time to move on."
"115740052-0-43560";"These crystals are set. Let's look for the entryway. Maybe it's upstairs?"
"115740052-0-43562";"Up there! They have to be coming from those holes. Let me get a better view."
"115740052-0-43563";"Stranger, those stockade ruffians hauled away my husband! Can you help me?"
"115740052-0-43564";"Yes! All right, place the crystals. I'll start the song."
"115740052-0-43568";"The song's done, we did it! Some of the Hadolids left the mine!"
"115740052-0-43569";"Father will be waiting for us at the camp. Use that door down there. That'll take you outside."
"115740052-0-43571";"You don't belong here, do you, little mouse? Come and tell Garwilith all about it."
"115740052-0-43575";"Guess my ancestor really did meet her end around here … but still no sign of her or her treasure."
"115740052-0-43576";"Return to the manor. Lady Arabelle must know of this. I'll return as soon as Islinne can travel."
"115740052-0-43577";"Oh, good. You're here. Have you recovered from your battle with the Ascendant Magus?"
"115740052-0-43578";"Not my finest work, but I think this venue will do."
"115740052-0-43579";"We're here to celebrate the coming together of three great leaders. And to show our appreciation for a hero who saved the delegates and kept our hopes for peace alive!"
"115740052-0-43580";"This is defeat? I … hate it."
"115740052-0-43582";"You think you can defeat the sea herself? I will be reborn like a wave …."
"115740052-0-43583";"I am simply mortified! My brother and my steward—traitors! I must return to my castle and barricade the gates!"
"115740052-0-43585";"Wake up, my darling! And thanks for opening the vault. You always did have a way with locks and keys."
"115740052-0-43586";"Marcelle? What are you doing in that cage?"
"115740052-0-43587";"Poor Valentyn. As confused as ever. You're in the cage, my dear. I'm stealing the treasure!"
"115740052-0-43591";"The ship looks seaworthy. We just need to get past those Ascendant Order knights."
"115740052-0-43592";"Always with the plans. I usually just wing it."
"115740052-0-43594";"Get ready, all of you. Once things begin, we'll need to move fast."
"115740052-0-43600";"Run!"
"115740052-0-43604";"Yes, dear, we saw. But where are the alliance leaders? Friend, let's talk."
"115740052-0-43605";"Valentyn? How did you—?"
"115740052-0-43606";"You constantly underestimate me, oh love of my life. Here, let me just cut these ropes for you."
"115740052-0-43607";"Damn you, Valentyn! I didn't think you had it in you. But I will see you soon, my love. Count on it."
"115740052-0-43608";"Always, my love. Always."
"115740052-0-43609";"Welcome, my dear. What news do you bring from Steadfast Manor?"
"115740052-0-43610";"Ah, Lady Arabelle's associate. What news do you bring me?"
"115740052-0-43611";"Damn, the legend was right. I do need three keys."
"115740052-0-43612";"There, that's Brisha! You talk to him. I'm going to hang back and keep watch. I don't want anything surprising us."
"115740052-0-43613";"These old ruins … this must be the place. Look around for a key while I keep watch."
"115740052-0-43614";"A stone structure? The key must be in there! Oh, what does that plaque say?"
"115740052-0-43615";"Hmm. Plinths. Must be these low pedestals over here. There's a shawl on one already, so we just need to find a sacred leaf and the traitor's coal."
"115740052-0-43616";"Well, that's a leaf and a chunk of coal. Start with the leaf. Place it on the plinth closest to the center of the island."
"115740052-0-43617";"Ah, I guess they mean the other center. Try placing the leaf on the other plinth."
"115740052-0-43618";"That seems right! Now place the coal."
"115740052-0-43619";"That did it! The door appears clear. Well done!"
"115740052-0-43620";"Let's insert our keys. Hopefully, we don't have to turn them all at the same time."
"115740052-0-43621";"Will you look at that. Amazing! Let's head inside."
"115740052-0-43622";"Put them to sleep and throw them in the cage. Remember, the boss said not to hurt them."
"115740052-0-43623";"All right, my minions, gather up the treasure and let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-43624";"Isn't she a marvel? Well, we need our own escape route. Here, grab my hammer and chisel and find us a way out of here."
"115740052-0-43625";"Sounds solid. Knock in another spot."
"115740052-0-43626";"No, too solid. Look for a large crack or something."
"115740052-0-43627";"That sounds promising!"
"115740052-0-43628";"Oh, well done!"
"115740052-0-43629";"And that's why I carry a hammer and chisel! Now let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-43630";"There's our exit. I'll set up this ladder while you find the gem. Check the lockboxes that Marcelle left behind. It has to be in one of them."
"115740052-0-43631";"That's definitely the Daybreak Gem, my friend. Look how it refuses to glisten! Now, up the ladder and let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-43632";"Ropes? Oh, very clever, Marcelle!"
"115740052-0-43633";"I'm grateful for any information about the fates of my friends, old man. You've been a great help."
"115740052-0-43634";"Heh, you can show your appreciation by not calling me old man, little jekosiit."
"115740052-0-43635";"If you find Jhaka, Silverslip or pretty little Song, you let this one know, yes? And be careful, Ember."
"115740052-0-43636";"I will, I promise. And then we'll be back to eat all your bread, just like the old days."
"115740052-0-43637";"Hello, friend. Looking for me?"
"115740052-0-43638";"Well met, friend! Come, have a drink with me."
"115740052-0-43639";"Magus-slayer! To what do I owe this pleasure?"
"115740052-0-43640";"Was it too much to hope that we'd find Jhaka outside sweeping or something? Come on, guess we have to go inside."
"115740052-0-43641";"On behalf of Lord Bacaro and the Society of the Steadfast, I ask our honored guests to enjoy the celebration!"
"115740052-0-43642";"The Aldmeri Dominion thanks our hero and promises to participate when the talks resume."
"115740052-0-43643";"The Ebonheart Pact wholeheartedly agrees!"
"115740052-0-43644";"As does the Daggerfall Covenant. Three cheers for our hero, and for Lord Bacaro!"
"115740052-0-43645";"Our service here at the Gateway Inn is second to none."
"115740052-0-43646";"Well said, high king! And well said queen and prince! Let the celebration begin!"
"115740052-0-43647";"A bracelet? Really? Can't I just stab this guy in the ribs and get the information that way? No? Ugh, fine."
"115740052-0-43648";"Lady Arabelle! The Order is attacking the castle!"
"115740052-0-43652";"Hold on, let's talk. I think I've got a plan."
"115740052-0-43661";"What? What is this?"
"115740052-0-43663";"Vehk save me! What is this?"
"115740052-0-43665";"Look, that must be Tarazka's lantern! I think we found our entrance!"
"115740052-0-43667";"This is the place. Let's chat before we rush in."
"115740052-0-43668";"Use the shell again, and keep your eyes peeled for anything glowing."
"115740052-0-43669";"This one can smell fresh air!"
"115740052-0-43670";"Talk to Jhaka, would you? I want to heal him a bit."
"115740052-0-43671";"Are you questioning my orders, worm? Leave the medallions exactly as I instructed."
"115740052-0-43672";"Is that Ember? The little shadow of Skywatch?"
"115740052-0-43673";"That's him, over there! He's still alive! Jhaka, we're here to help!"
"115740052-0-43675";"Ember, you've grown so much. This one is so grateful to see how strong you've become."
"115740052-0-43676";"Oh, you big lug, I missed you. I swore I would find you no matter what it took, even if the two moons fell from the sky."
"115740052-0-43677";"Thank you, little sister. You have found me, so be at peace. Next, we will find Silverslip and Song."
"115740052-0-43678";"Pretty enough place, Marbruk. We should seek out an Outlaws Refuge, Jhaka will likely be nearby."
"115740052-0-43679";"There he is, the lazy lump."
"115740052-0-43680";"We'll see what we can learn, Jhaka. You catch up on your sleep."
"115740052-0-43681";"You are predictable, Ember. I knew you would not wait for me to write again."
"115740052-0-43682";"What can I say? I haven't changed a bit. Talk to our friend here about what you found out. I'm going to watch our backs."
"115740052-0-43683";"Right, that's settled. I hope you all have learned your lesson. Don't pay the bill to shady characters in a back room."
"115740052-0-43684";"We are in agreement! I hope this means I can have my scepter back."
"115740052-0-43685";"Huh? Who's this? Stand still, would ya? Better have a good reason for interrupting my drinking."
"115740052-0-43686";"Oh. She must have taken ill after dinner last night. Is that a note by the bed?"
"115740052-0-43687";"Look for a mammoth ear plant in the woods near the manor. We need to wake her up!"
"115740052-0-43688";"Crush the leaf and give her the juice. If she wakes up, we can tell her about her share of the bill!"
"115740052-0-43689";"A diplomatic success! Thank goodness we were able to help her recover from this unforeseen illness."
"115740052-0-43690";"Oh, I hate this. Got a bad feeling. Let's get inside."
"115740052-0-43691";"Ulgonash is a prisoner? I don't understand. Ask him what happened!"
"115740052-0-43692";"You'd better talk to the guard. Ulgonash won't be able to pay his share of the tab if he's in prison!"
"115740052-0-43693";"Can you talk to Silverslip for me? I need a moment to brace myself."
"115740052-0-43694";"You are very clever, friend! Just find <<1>>'s ill-gotten booty and I'll get my scepter back. Is simple!"
"115740052-0-43695";"I'm still me, Ember. I'm not about to lose control. But fine, I'll speak with your friend. They already read about all my secrets already."
"115740052-0-43696";"You are back! Do you have the sk—er, the dessert? <<1>> is waiting!"
"115740052-0-43697";"I don't expect you to forgive me, Ember."
"115740052-0-43699";"Let me talk to my friend first, Silverslip. Don't go anywhere."
"115740052-0-43700";"I'm just glad you're alive, Silverslip. We already found Jhaka, too. He's in Marbruk."
"115740052-0-43701";"Wait, stop! I recognize this journal! It's Silverslip's, she always kept it on her. She's been here!"
"115740052-0-43702";"Really? You found him? Oh, Ember. I'm … I'm different now, but I can still help. Let me atone for all of this."
"115740052-0-43703";"You're the only one who saw that strange eye drawn in the letter. We need you, Silverslip. We'll find Song together."
"115740052-0-43705";"Ember? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-43706";"Silverslip! You, oh no, you—"
"115740052-0-43707";"Meet me outside. We can talk there."
"115740052-0-43708";"Silverslip is safe and well. But Silverslip is also a vampire. I'm really not sure how I'm supposed to feel right now."
"115740052-0-43709";"Are you safe here, in Marbruk, Jhaka? Do you have a place to stay?"
"115740052-0-43710";"You need not worry so much, little sister. You'll end up with even more white hair. Jhaka is fine."
"115740052-0-43711";"Psst, I've got an idea of how we can sober this guy up."
"115740052-0-43712";"Excellent! Good thing we came along when we did. I can't imagine how he got himself into this situation."
"115740052-0-43713";"It worked! She's awake! I was a little worried that she might be dead."
"115740052-0-43714";"Excellent! <<1>> has paid his debt to society. Another diplomatic triumph!"
"115740052-0-43715";"Jakarn? Lady Arabelle's assistant? How did you find me?"
"115740052-0-43716";"Thank you for coming to my aid, Jakarn."
"115740052-0-43717";"I take it back. Where's the Ascendant Order? I want to be recaptured."
"115740052-0-43718";"My darling Valessea, the glowing adoration in your eyes as you gaze upon me is more than thanks enough."
"115740052-0-43719";"If Jhaka and Silverslip catch up with us, I think Jhaka will like it here. It's sandy and warm."
"115740052-0-43720";"Look! That tomb! That has to be it!"
"115740052-0-43722";"Song? Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-43725";"If Jhaka and Silverslip catch up with us, I think Jhaka will like it here. Sandy, seems warm."
"115740052-0-43726";"Estranged family member, cut out, probably embittered. I bet Izbadd was right and we'll find Azamel at the inn."
"115740052-0-43730";"I'll admit I wasn't entirely faking being a drunk but I know who you are, Ember."
"115740052-0-43731";"I've never seen you before in my life, wine-breath."
"115740052-0-43732";"Another diplomatic success! Thank you, friends, for an unforgettable night."
"115740052-0-43733";"It was certainly a, well, unique experience."
"115740052-0-43734";"Agreed. It was unique. Let's all agree to never speak of it again."
"115740052-0-43735";"What a night! Time for a little nightcap, and then to bed. Where's my house again?"
"115740052-0-43736";"<stinger>"
"115740052-0-43737";"<stinger>"
"115740052-0-43738";"Over there, drunk looking toff. Bet that's our man."
"115740052-0-43739";"Fish biscuits, this is getting ridiculous."
"115740052-0-43740";"Save it, Jakarn."
"115740052-0-43741";"That looks like a piece of Valessea's robes. She always did look great in that color. Come on, we must be close!"
"115740052-0-43742";"Looks like there was a scuffle here. The smaller footprints could be Valessea's."
"115740052-0-43743";"Ascendant Champion, hmm? I don't like the sound of that."
"115740052-0-43744";"<stinger>"
"115740052-0-43745";"Valessea! Your dashing hero is here to rescue you!"
"115740052-0-43746";"The Emerald Eye has many agents in Sentinel. But down here, we can speak freely."
"115740052-0-43748";"What did you find?"
"115740052-0-43749";"Come on, we have to find a tomb that looks different from the rest."
"115740052-0-43750";"Do not resist, Mahtelah! You only make it worse!"
"115740052-0-43751";"Father, please don't do this!"
"115740052-0-43752";"Ember? Help me!"
"115740052-0-43754";"That must be the relic! It's hurting her, we need to destroy it!"
"115740052-0-43755";"You will commune with the relic!"
"115740052-0-43756";"You haven't changed a bit! Friend, go ahead and speak with him."
"115740052-0-43758";"At least the game has rules. Let's talk before going deeper."
"115740052-0-43759";"Anton isn't sentimental, but he respects tradition. He wouldn't leave his family pendant behind."
"115740052-0-43760";"Looks like Anton tried to defend himself with that old knife of his."
"115740052-0-43761";"Anton has worn the same shirt since we came to Amenos. That's a scrap of it."
"115740052-0-43762";"How about that? The raft worked. Let's move inland and look for Anton."
"115740052-0-43763";"I see him! On that platform!"
"115740052-0-43764";"<stinger>"
"115740052-0-43765";"<stinger>"
"115740052-0-43766";"I'll create portals for you and Jakarn, Lady Arabelle."
"115740052-0-43767";"Can you keep up, Anton?"
"115740052-0-43768";"I could outrace you with my legs tied together!"
"115740052-0-43769";"I see the shore! We're almost to the raft!"
"115740052-0-43770";"Where on Amenos did you possibly find a raft?"
"115740052-0-43771";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-43772";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-43773";"I'm sure you're overwhelmed by the sight of me. Just a moment and I'll untie you."
"115740052-0-43775";"Stinger"
"115740052-0-43777";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43778";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43779";"Heh. That bumpkin gave me three times what I asked for the skooma. Paid for the best night I've had in years … zzz."
"115740052-0-43780";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43781";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43782";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43783";"Enough, Jakarn. I've been dealing with worse villains since before you were born!"
"115740052-0-43784";"Over here! It's the druid's tome!"
"115740052-0-43785";"The cavern broke open to the bay again! Let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-43788";"Valessea is as brilliant as she is beautiful! The shell works! Now, let's find the rest."
"115740052-0-43790";"There she is! Who's that with her? He looks familiar."
"115740052-0-43791";"I can't believe the town guard didn't want to help us."
"115740052-0-43792";"We'll keep looking, Lady Aurelia. I bet he's just laying low somewhere on the island."
"115740052-0-43793";"I cannot believe you lost that ring, Aurelia. Hello Captain Marso. Funny to see you here."
"115740052-0-43794";"Good to see you, Isobel. I know you're upset, but the thief may still be on the island. Perhaps more stolen goods fell from his bag as he ran?"
"115740052-0-43795";"That's a great idea. If he dropped more things as he ran, we could use the trail to track him."
"115740052-0-43796";"Yes, go and see. Maybe he dropped the ring and it's just sitting in the street somewhere."
"115740052-0-43797";"Now I must take my leave. I have other matters to attend to."
"115740052-0-43798";"We hid the medallions throughout the grotto as you requested. Do you want to take them with you?"
"115740052-0-43799";"This ends here!"
"115740052-0-43800";"Ugh. I can smell that from here. Is that … hair grease? Figures."
"115740052-0-43801";"Ooh, sweetroll! I was right, he must have gone for a ship. Let's ask around, maybe someone saw where he went."
"115740052-0-43802";"Oh no! He got away! Isobel, I'm so sorry!"
"115740052-0-43803";"Draigh. Let's talk, my friend."
"115740052-0-43804";"Are you going after that scoundrel?"
"115740052-0-43805";"Yes, thanks to my extremely kind companion here. Aurelia … what am I going to do with you?"
"115740052-0-43806";"A projection? What is the meaning of this?"
"115740052-0-43807";"Did you say evil magic? Dispel it! Dispel it this instant!"
"115740052-0-43808";"Za'ji will keep lookout from the high ground!"
"115740052-0-43809";"Nothing but rotters and sticky blob-things as far as this one sees. Be wary!"
"115740052-0-43810";"Ho ho! Everything's so slick with rain and slime!"
"115740052-0-43811";"No trouble for one with claws as sharp as Za'ji's. And a bit fun, he must admit."
"115740052-0-43812";"Hey, walker! How are you doing down there?"
"115740052-0-43813";"Ah, you look busy. Za'ji will meet you ahead."
"115740052-0-43815";"You're not a local, are ya? I can tell, you're not covered in swamp moss."
"115740052-0-43823";"We are nearing the lumber yards! Za'ji will meet you just ahead!"
"115740052-0-43825";"These Ascendant Order rats just keep climbing up! Help me dispatch them!"
"115740052-0-43826";"And we're through! That wasn't so hard now, was it?"
"115740052-0-43827";"If that next ship reaches the dock, we'll be overrun. We have to do something!"
"115740052-0-43828";"Oof, oh … cramp! Za'ji believes you have this under control. He will search … over there. Out of harm's—out of the way! Just to be thorough."
"115740052-0-43830";"The door at the south end leads down to the dock. Keep them from scaling the walls and I'll put this siege weapon to good use!"
"115740052-0-43831";"These evil druids are feeding the storm! Disrupt their ritual, friend!"
"115740052-0-43832";"That's better! Now it's a fair fight!"
"115740052-0-43833";"Victory is ours, friend! But we shouldn't linger too long. We need a solid plan."
"115740052-0-43834";"No sign of any plans up here! Oh, you bested that ghost! Good!"
"115740052-0-43835";"Ahhh, I think that cramp is finally going away. I'll be right down!"
"115740052-0-43836";"The logging camp beyond this gate is now little more than treacherous woods. Be wary, Za'ji doesn't wish to lose you like his first mate."
"115740052-0-43837";"I may fall … but the Ascendant Lord will still triumph …."
"115740052-0-43839";"How could I have trusted him?"
"115740052-0-43840";"The Magus falls and his minions scatter. Cowards!"
"115740052-0-43841";"We cut down the Magus, but the Lord is still out there. Somewhere."
"115740052-0-43842";"The Magus has fallen. We will deliver the same fate to his Lord."
"115740052-0-43843";"Our friend here made this victory possible."
"115740052-0-43844";"Indeed! And they got us to work together. Amazing! Now let's go find Lady Arabelle!"
"115740052-0-43845";"<Bestial roar.>"
"115740052-0-43846";"Thanks for keeping an eye on Za'ji, whoever you are."
"115740052-0-43847";"At least you brought someone useful with you. Good to see you again, five-claw."
"115740052-0-43848";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43849";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43850";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-43851";"You head down the ravine, I will clear out the upper ledges! Za'ji stay out of the way."
"115740052-0-43856";"Keep up, Za'ji, or I'll take you by the scruff!"
"115740052-0-43864";"Draigh, looks like he was honest. This time."
"115740052-0-43876";"Oh no, those are members of the Lion Guard. What happened here? Let's look around."
"115740052-0-43877";"Damn! I can't believe they're really trying to kill High King Emeric! Come on, we have to get inside!"
"115740052-0-43879";"This way."
"115740052-0-43880";"You can drop down here, to the right."
"115740052-0-43881";"Welcome home, Dame Veloise. Thank you for coming. I need you to deal with a bit of a situation."
"115740052-0-43882";"I'll do my best to find Aurelia. I'm sure she's safe."
"115740052-0-43883";"I hope that's true, Isobel. But we both know Aurelia. Once she's set a course, there's no changing it. Good luck."
"115740052-0-43884";"I'd guess he was drinking. A lot. It stinks like a tavern over here."
"115740052-0-43885";"That man … that man is not a poet."
"115740052-0-43886";"Stand on the quay … oh! The docks! Let's see if he's still down by the water."
"115740052-0-43887";"Nilsmon must be … do you smell that? All Flags rum. There's an empty bottle just ahead. He went over this bridge!"
"115740052-0-43888";"Have you breached High King Emeric's quarters yet?"
"115740052-0-43889";"Soon, my lord. We are almost through the wards."
"115740052-0-43890";"Nilsmon! Where's Aurelia? Have you seen her?"
"115740052-0-43891";"I will suffer no more delays. You have this last chance, Champion."
"115740052-0-43892";"Yes, Magus."
"115740052-0-43893";"This is where those meddlesome twigs attacked us before. Keep up your guard."
"115740052-0-43894";"Nilsmon, when you wake up go back to Castle Navire. And Stendarr's breath, take a bath! Woof."
"115740052-0-43895";"The tree-things keep growing back! Hurry and kill the big one!"
"115740052-0-43896";"Hmph, overgrown kindling. Za'ji! You all right?"
"115740052-0-43897";"What news of the woman?"
"115740052-0-43898";"She still eludes us, Magus. But there are only so many places she can hide."
"115740052-0-43899";"A careless mistake. Deal with Emeric. Then find the woman and kill her."
"115740052-0-43900";"It will be done, my lord."
"115740052-0-43901";"Of all the luck. Well, where to?"
"115740052-0-43902";"Listen! I hear someone up ahead!"
"115740052-0-43903";"Just how many people are in charge of the Ascendant Order?"
"115740052-0-43904";"Lady Clarisse Laurent … I'm Lady—"
"115740052-0-43905";"You opened my old hope chest? Oh, that's not good."
"115740052-0-43907";"It sounds like they haven't found Lady Arabelle yet. Come on, let's get to her first!"
"115740052-0-43908";"Psst. Over here."
"115740052-0-43909";"Ah ha! It still stands!"
"115740052-0-43910";"Za'ji will sneak in through the rafters!"
"115740052-0-43911";"Oof …! Za'ji is not often considered overweight, but that roof thought otherwise."
"115740052-0-43912";"This was ransacked, recently! Ziss! Za'ji's plans were here … the Sea Elves must have taken them!"
"115740052-0-43913";"Za'ji sees Elf thralls tearing up these derelicts. What salvage could they be after?"
"115740052-0-43914";"By the lighthouse! Look! The Elves' ship! We can't let them escape!"
"115740052-0-43916";"Ha! We are not drowned so easily fish-Elf!"
"115740052-0-43917";"Oh, he's dead. And his ship is long gone!"
"115740052-0-43918";"You think the Serpents were telling the truth? Freedom if we find the lost nobles?"
"115740052-0-43919";"You know that Khajiiti saying—If it sounds too good, it probably is."
"115740052-0-43921";"I don't care what you say. I'm heading into the jungle!"
"115740052-0-43922";"Don't be stupid, Rassa. You're safer here in the stockade."
"115740052-0-43923";"I am a good hunter! Freedom or death!"
"115740052-0-43925";"Isobel! Thank Leki! Quickly, Aurelia is this way."
"115740052-0-43926";"Sorry Captain, two of those bastards jumped us. Threw her in a boat, headed down the coast."
"115740052-0-43927";"Look there, it's Captain Marso!"
"115740052-0-43928";"We're right behind you."
"115740052-0-43929";"Talk to Marso, my friend. I'll keep watch."
"115740052-0-43930";"I'm so sorry Captain, they caught me by surprise."
"115740052-0-43931";"Follow the coast to the southeast, friends. I'll patch my wounds and follow behind."
"115740052-0-43932";"Isobel! Oh, I've never been so happy to see you. Quick, untie me!"
"115740052-0-43934";"I don't know how you found us, but I'm so glad you did! I have so much to tell you!"
"115740052-0-43935";"Aurelia, your mother reached out to me. She's worried sick."
"115740052-0-43936";"Oh don't worry about mother. I've been on a quest! And I've learned so much!"
"115740052-0-43937";"I'm here Marso! And I'm fine. Thanks to Isobel and her friend."
"115740052-0-43938";"All right, good-looking. Be careful up there, we'll handle the mage."
"115740052-0-43939";"Ugh. At least I didn't land on my face."
"115740052-0-43940";"Dame Madach!"
"115740052-0-43941";"Let's head to the statuary hall, on the northwest side of the gardens. Should be plenty of bone to work with there."
"115740052-0-43942";"That one looks strong enough. It'll work for what we need."
"115740052-0-43943";"Somewhere in here is the old executioner square. Keep an eye out for a block, most likely still stained from the tower's darkest days."
"115740052-0-43945";"I cringe to imagine what horrors that thing has seen. All right, now we need to get the water flowing around the tower again. Let's head to the mill, southeast of the tower."
"115740052-0-43946";"Hopefully the mechanism is just jammed. See if you can find a way to get it turning again."
"115740052-0-43947";"Almost done! We can assemble the weapon at the smithy, southwest of the tower. Let's go."
"115740052-0-43948";"And here we are! Use one of those workbenches to bind the bone and the block together."
"115740052-0-43950";"Exemplary work! Now quench it in the water of the tower, and we'll have what we need!"
"115740052-0-43951";"The weapon is ready. Let's head to the tower!"
"115740052-0-43956";"This is it! We need to destroy his phylactery! Smash it with the bone hammer!"
"115740052-0-43957";"I'm dangerous, too, wretch."
"115740052-0-43958";"Muzi. Hosh. Kill!"
"115740052-0-43959";"Stendarr give me strength. Look, on the bridge. More poetry."
"115740052-0-43961";"I'm sorry I worried you, Izzy. Don't fret, though. Marso and I will rest up at an inn. And then it's back to the investigation!"
"115740052-0-43962";"A knight does not forget that it is their duty to serve others."
"115740052-0-43963";"Knights, lost to the forgotten past, let us live in a manner that befits your long-gone memory."
"115740052-0-43964";"A knight is humble in the face of all that lies beyond mortal comprehension. A knight does not fight the end when it draws near."
"115740052-0-43965";"A knight is courageous, even in the face of insurmountable danger."
"115740052-0-43966";"Your pitiful attempt here will see no return. Begone!"
"115740052-0-43967";"We've got him on the run, Rayan! Keep going!"
"115740052-0-43968";"Help! Hey, help!"
"115740052-0-43969";"Urgh."
"115740052-0-43970";"You've shown great endurance, challenger. Well done."
"115740052-0-43971";"To learn the phrase needed to win the shield, memorize the words on this tablet."
"115740052-0-43972";"Bella? Is that you? Come on up, we're just upstairs!"
"115740052-0-43974";"What have you done? Noooo!"
"115740052-0-43975";"Fair day! Just the people I was hoping to see."
"115740052-0-43977";"Good to see you, Commander."
"115740052-0-43978";"All right, we have to organize … by the Divines, Izzy! I'm so glad to see you!"
"115740052-0-43979";"I just confirmed it, dear child. He's there. I know it."
"115740052-0-43980";"We'll go find your Captain, Aurelia.  Just stay here, stay safe."
"115740052-0-43981";"I'm so glad you came. I feel better already, just knowing you're going after Marso."
"115740052-0-43982";"Ah, you are a handsome sight! Thank the Eight!"
"115740052-0-43983";"Let's get you out of here, Captain. Aurelia is worried sick!"
"115740052-0-43984";"Thank you both. I thought I was going to end up in an Ogrim's belly."
"115740052-0-43985";"Thank you both! I'll meet you outside!"
"115740052-0-43986";"Ah, you were sent by Leki himself. Thank you, my friends."
"115740052-0-43987";"Don't get any of them on me!"
"115740052-0-43988";"You—you saved me! those crabs were going to … touch my legs with their disgusting shells."
"115740052-0-43989";"Not another one!"
"115740052-0-43990";"No! Not another crab!"
"115740052-0-43991";"Over here, quickly! They have Aurelia!"
"115740052-0-43992";"Aurelia figured out where you were, Captain. She deserves the credit."
"115740052-0-43993";"Just you wait, you beef-witted sandpiper! My friends will find me!"
"115740052-0-43994";"One less villain to trouble the world. Let's help Aurelia."
"115740052-0-43995";"Thank Stendarr you're all right."
"115740052-0-43996";"Ah, Aurelia!"
"115740052-0-43997";"Marso! Oh, Izzy thank you! I knew you would find him!"
"115740052-0-43998";"Oh thank Akatosh! Get it off of me!"
"115740052-0-43999";"Awww. Poor Rocky. All I wanted to do was ride him, but he didn't seem to want that."
"115740052-0-44000";"Ooh! An even bigger one! I'm going for it."
"115740052-0-44001";"Hey there new friend. Do you wanna go for a ride?"
"115740052-0-44002";"This is it. My family home. I'm not nervous, you're nervous."
"115740052-0-44003";"My friend, I'm proud to introduce you to the honorable Delven Veloise, and Lady Miriette Veloise."
"115740052-0-44010";"Izzy! And her friend! I knew you'd find me!"
"115740052-0-44011";"This jungle is dangerous, Caska. You and your friend shouldn't be wandering about."
"115740052-0-44013";"What was that one about? I found something about crop rotation. Exciting."
"115740052-0-44018";"Oh bother! M'lady's gotten herself into terrible trouble!"
"115740052-0-44020";"Berjo! That trunk is not going to chop itself!"
"115740052-0-44022";"She is fine, surely … Caska will be back any moment."
"115740052-0-44023";"Wha—beware salty spirit! Za'ji will not go easy—oh … phew, you're no ghost."
"115740052-0-44024";"Ah! Careful there squire! Don't let the branches snap back! You've scratched my armor!"
"115740052-0-44025";"That hilt must be around here somewhere! Get to work!"
"115740052-0-44027";"Fair's fair and well played. Good luck to you both. Hmph."
"115740052-0-44028";"Look, I think that's the lute! Oh … and that must be what remains of Sir Brenvale, then."
"115740052-0-44029";"Caska, you've been injured."
"115740052-0-44030";"Merely a few scratches."
"115740052-0-44031";"Let me tend to your wounds."
"115740052-0-44036";"Caska will be all right. And you have the items? Well done!"
"115740052-0-44037";"This little beauty will help us immensely, you'll see."
"115740052-0-44038";"This is the spot, but no Emeric. That man is infuriating!"
"115740052-0-44040";"This complicates the situation. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-44041";"Alas, no sign of what he seeks yet. Let us continue this way!"
"115740052-0-44042";"It's even hotter in here than I imagined. We should hurry to find the scoria and Tarrinore. Before it's too late."
"115740052-0-44046";"The first exit is now unlocked. Proceed!"
"115740052-0-44047";"The second exit is unlocked! Exit to complete the trial."
"115740052-0-44048";"I'll see you at the fort! Do try to keep pace with Caska, Emeric. She'll keep you safe."
"115740052-0-44051";"There's too many! I can't hold—"
"115740052-0-44052";"They're here for the prisoner! Take them out or Sarydil will have our heads!"
"115740052-0-44053";"They're too strong! Regroup!"
"115740052-0-44054";"There's one!"
"115740052-0-44055";"Ah, there's the sneaky bastard!"
"115740052-0-44056";"I see something over there!"
"115740052-0-44057";"See! We've nothing to fear from bloody fish-monsters."
"115740052-0-44058";"That's all five medallions! Come on, I think I saw a way out of here!"
"115740052-0-44059";"This one's in no mood for more intruders!"
"115740052-0-44060";"If you insist!"
"115740052-0-44061";"See you at Lady Arabelle's camp!"
"115740052-0-44062";"Let's do this quick."
"115740052-0-44063";"No word on the blessed awl's whereabouts?"
"115740052-0-44064";"Not yet. And the weavers begin to close their ears to Zenithar's teachings of patience and collaboration."
"115740052-0-44065";"Here we are. I'm going to cast a little purifying spell while you place the crystal so nothing disturbs us."
"115740052-0-44066";"I'll draw the Serpents out. Be ready."
"115740052-0-44067";"Don't worry yourself. Today is a glorious day. Zenithar will provide the means for the awl's recovery."
"115740052-0-44068";"Hands off, you bastard!"
"115740052-0-44070";"Steady, my friend …."
"115740052-0-44071";"Attack!"
"115740052-0-44072";"Well done! Caska and I will cause a distraction. Go find Prince Irnskar."
"115740052-0-44073";"Ugh. Can I assume this is a rescue?"
"115740052-0-44074";"There! Let's listen in."
"115740052-0-44076";"My liege, we must go!"
"115740052-0-44078";"Forgive me if I do the job you hired me for, Lord Bacaro. Ah, a familiar face. I could use your help, adventurer."
"115740052-0-44079";"Forgive me if I do the job you hired me for, Lord Bacaro. You there, might we speak?"
"115740052-0-44083";"Hold them at bay! Sea Elf rituals are fickle things, but I shall quiet the storm."
"115740052-0-44084";"Wind, waves, and salt, heed my call and still your fury!"
"115740052-0-44085";"It's working!"
"115740052-0-44086";"Don't let them interrupt the queen!"
"115740052-0-44087";"No ship can reach us through this storm!"
"115740052-0-44088";"Patience, lad. Ayrenn is working on that."
"115740052-0-44089";"I don't believe it. She actually did it!"
"115740052-0-44090";"Ah, here we are. I'll make sure nothing gets in our way while you place the warding crystal."
"115740052-0-44091";"At least we go together …."
"115740052-0-44094";"This is the last one, let's get this over with quick. Place the warding crystal."
"115740052-0-44095";"I hear these knights are robbing people and looting caravans! Someone ought to do something."
"115740052-0-44101";"Please, dear lady. You've been dealing spirits across the island, I ask you to hear me out."
"115740052-0-44107";"Stupid motes!"
"115740052-0-44108";"See if you can find anything in the tower about the motes. I'll meet you there and start on the traps."
"115740052-0-44109";"Might as well enjoy ourselves while we're here. Do you still prefer a Russafeld red, my lady?"
"115740052-0-44110";"That would be delightful. Thank you, Bacaro."
"115740052-0-44111";"Introduce yourself to the nobility, my friend. And remember, even the smallest detail could be the clue we seek."
"115740052-0-44112";"Come on, just one more match. Give me a chance to win my gold back!"
"115740052-0-44113";"You in here? Did you find anything useful about the motes?"
"115740052-0-44114";"Why are these corridors so damn confusing?"
"115740052-0-44115";"Good luck setting up the traps! I'll meet you by the livestock pens when you're finished."
"115740052-0-44116";"Impressive. The next tablet waits beyond the northern door."
"115740052-0-44117";"Huh? What sorcery comes now?"
"115740052-0-44118";"Huh. Looks dead now."
"115740052-0-44119";"We are the Allwither. This grove belongs to us!"
"115740052-0-44120";"Let us have a look at the mill the—ah!"
"115740052-0-44121";"You cannot resist our corruption!"
"115740052-0-44123";"In light of all that has happened, Audrine, We would like to make you a circle elder and mediator with the Evergrowth."
"115740052-0-44124";"An elder? And the mediator? I … I don't know what to say."
"115740052-0-44125";"I hope you'll say yes! You proved yourself and demonstrated a singular rapport with the spirit of the grove. Will you take on these responsibilities?"
"115740052-0-44126";"I—yes, of course. Thank you!"
"115740052-0-44127";"Someone … please help me!"
"115740052-0-44128";"And what will you bet? That ridiculous nose ring? Find another racket, Brahgas. Tribute ain't for you."
"115740052-0-44130";"Well, here comes our hero now. Well done, my dear!"
"115740052-0-44131";"The last tablet awaits you. We'll talk after."
"115740052-0-44132";"Summon your fleets, and I will leave. The Ebonheart Pact will not negotiate under the threat of attack."
"115740052-0-44133";"Excellent! Who wants a drink? The Prince of Windhelm is buying!"
"115740052-0-44134";"Hold fast there, lad. We're safe for now, but the battle's just begun."
"115740052-0-44135";"Ha! A grand victory! Well, maybe a little too grand …. Go talk to Master Razhamad and tell him you bested me. Just don't get cocky! Next time won't be so easy."
"115740052-0-44136";"Za'ji is fine! Very itchy, but fine! Also, he found a map! It is brighter past the woods. He will meet you beyond the gate!"
"115740052-0-44137";"Sea Elves? Hiyah!"
"115740052-0-44139";"Is someone out there? Let me out of here!"
"115740052-0-44140";"Hear ye, cardsharps and collectors! Test your wits and courage in a brand new card game—Tales of Tribute!"
"115740052-0-44141";"It's happening! Look out!"
"115740052-0-44142";"The eruption is causing a chain reaction! I need you to hold back these infernal monsters while I seal the fissures!"
"115740052-0-44145";"Well done! Now's our chance! I'll seal the fissure for good."
"115740052-0-44146";"Did you feel how the ground shook?"
"115740052-0-44147";"Head inside. I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-44148";"Come back you scaly scallywags! You take what is rightfully Captain Za'ji's!"
"115740052-0-44149";"You did as we asked. We shall do the same. The Allwither is back where it belongs, as a natural part of our circle. Balance has been restored."
"115740052-0-44150";"Zenithar? Are you there? I've given you an offering, don't you like it?"
"115740052-0-44151";"Zenithar? Oh! That's hot! Fire! Aaaaah!"
"115740052-0-44152";"Zenithar? Wh-wait, why do I feel motivated? It worked! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-44153";"I think not, thank you."
"115740052-0-44154";"Tell us what's in that sack—furface—or we'll take it from you. Forcefully."
"115740052-0-44155";"It's not what you think. You don't want that. Please, just take Zalezu's money!"
"115740052-0-44156";"You won't distract me, cretin. Open the bag or I'll start with your tail!"
"115740052-0-44157";"Thank you. You saved this one's fur. Here, take the sack. Zalezu won it at the festival."
"115740052-0-44158";"<Baaa!>"
"115740052-0-44159";"<Baaa?>"
"115740052-0-44160";"Vulk'esh? Be careful. They're drawn to volcanic activity."
"115740052-0-44161";"This is all Ember's fault!"
"115740052-0-44162";"Zenithar's blessed light is rumored to guide those who see it to lost artifacts. Watch for it on your travels my knowledgeable friend."
"115740052-0-44163";"Ah, ha … Za'ji can feel that cramp coming again, he will follow you from this gentle trail."
"115740052-0-44164";"<Mrooooooooo!>"
"115740052-0-44165";"<Mroo?! Moo.>"
"115740052-0-44168";"You made such swift work of these ones though, Za'ji could hardly keep up!"
"115740052-0-44169";"Slow down, friend. Lady Arabelle wants to see you."
"115740052-0-44170";"Hey there! Things are heating up and Lady Arabelle doesn't want you to miss out."
"115740052-0-44171";"Another trap! I'll hold those beasts off. Kill that damn spriggan!"
"115740052-0-44172";"Brahgas, I told you … I can't do that. You know the rules. Those days are behind me."
"115740052-0-44173";"Hey, of course! Just trying to help out my friends. No worries, all right?"
"115740052-0-44175";"Follow me, the library is downstairs!"
"115740052-0-44176";"I don't sense anything. Maybe the old man was bluffing."
"115740052-0-44177";"It seems safe so far."
"115740052-0-44178";"Fish biscuits!"
"115740052-0-44179";"I warned you, Ember!"
"115740052-0-44180";"This spell is specifically targeting me! I'll figure out a way down, you just focus on getting the book!"
"115740052-0-44181";"Attack! Amunara commands you!"
"115740052-0-44182";"The shield has a new bearer—my oath is fulfilled. I'm finally … free."
"115740052-0-44183";"The Order is trying to recruit Quentyn? We have to put a stop to this!"
"115740052-0-44185";"Sibling seas, answer me."
"115740052-0-44186";"My blood is the tides! The more you spill the more shall rise up to swallow you!"
"115740052-0-44187";"The deep claims leviathans and holds them in its thrall. Where they are tamed, you shall be crushed!"
"115740052-0-44188";"So you land-crawlers do have teeth, but you are nothing but slaughterfish among sharks."
"115740052-0-44189";"I am Dreadsail, born of the sea. I cannot be defeated!"
"115740052-0-44190";"Curse you all to the deep …!"
"115740052-0-44191";"Wait! Za'ji …! Come on, better get after him."
"115740052-0-44192";"You've come for a job … I don't tolerate tardiness."
"115740052-0-44193";"You labor day and night. Day and night, while I waste away."
"115740052-0-44194";"Can't you stay? Can't you stay one night? I'm so alone here."
"115740052-0-44195";"You finally came, but I'm gone!"
"115740052-0-44196";"I filled this place with tears until I drowned!"
"115740052-0-44197";"Don't leave me!"
"115740052-0-44198";"It's your turn to suffer!"
"115740052-0-44199";"I didn't deserve this!"
"115740052-0-44200";"Just end it! Like you always wanted to!"
"115740052-0-44201";"You'll stay with me now. We can be miserable together."
"115740052-0-44202";"I just wanted to be with you …."
"115740052-0-44205";"I said get to the crow's nest and spot us a break in this storm!"
"115740052-0-44206";"Captain, the lightning—"
"115740052-0-44207";"I gave you an order sailor! Get up there or I'll toss you overboard!"
"115740052-0-44208";"Hear about the ship that crashed into the harbor? Not a soul aboard."
"115740052-0-44209";"Aye, and a hundred smoldering strikes on the deck from lightning."
"115740052-0-44210";"Must've been Dagon's own storm!"
"115740052-0-44211";"My veins are on fire!"
"115740052-0-44212";"I'm here! First, we need to set the ritual flames. There's three around the site."
"115740052-0-44213";"I warned you, captain! I warned you!"
"115740052-0-44214";"The sky … it's clearing …."
"115740052-0-44215";"Light the three ritual flames here. I'll get the ones on the altar!"
"115740052-0-44216";"I'm going to start casting my counterspell! If you can keep anything from interfering, it'd be much appreciated!"
"115740052-0-44217";"Hey! We were here first!"
"115740052-0-44218";"This isn't the market, recruit. Back in line."
"115740052-0-44219";"Here we go!"
"115740052-0-44221";"Magical traps! Watch your step!"
"115740052-0-44222";"This is it!"
"115740052-0-44223";"He's gone, damn it. Come on—we've got to find Lady Arabelle!"
"115740052-0-44224";"Oh please, only eight of you? I expected more of a fight!"
"115740052-0-44225";"That's Lady Arabelle! We're close!"
"115740052-0-44226";"The Magus said you were—that they would—uh, never mind. Friend, tell Lady Arabelle what we found out."
"115740052-0-44227";"Things seem much calmer now, perhaps—"
"115740052-0-44228";"Ahh …! Caska, ah ha ha. Za'ji has found you!"
"115740052-0-44229";"Might have been sooner if you hadn't run so far."
"115740052-0-44230";"Don't worry, it'll be like Za'ji was never there!"
"115740052-0-44231";"Almost there."
"115740052-0-44232";"It's done, the spell is set! Follow me, we should be able to see it materialize!"
"115740052-0-44236";"There's the Silver Swan, moored out in the bay. Hurry! If they set sail, we'll never catch her!"
"115740052-0-44237";"Nothing worse than guard duty …."
"115740052-0-44238";"They must be here for Za'ji's treasure! We must hurry!"
"115740052-0-44239";"Za'ji's map tells him the master shipbuilder's office should be just over the bridge!"
"115740052-0-44240";"Scavengers? Bah! Take the lodestones to Dreadsail Reef. I'll make sure these wretches can't follow."
"115740052-0-44241";"I'd like to see you try—ayyy!"
"115740052-0-44242";"Za'ji. His pockets."
"115740052-0-44243";"Yes, these scroll cases bear the shipyard's crest! Caska, Za'ji could kiss you—but he values his unmangled face."
"115740052-0-44244";"But wait—if this is not what they were after, then what was it the Sea Elf was boasting about? How could any lodestones be more a prize than this?"
"115740052-0-44245";"Y'ffre's power trembles. Someone has disturbed the balance."
"115740052-0-44246";"It's going to blow! I'll try to contain it but I can't do it alone!"
"115740052-0-44247";"Chop, chop go the trees, soon they sail the salty seas …."
"115740052-0-44248";"Chop chop the lumberjack goes, hacking off the bossman's toes …."
"115740052-0-44249";"Time to feel the axeman's bite."
"115740052-0-44250";"Split and hew, for the axeman's due."
"115740052-0-44251";"Hacked to bits, stacked up high, that's how the traitors die."
"115740052-0-44252";"The noose holds tight …!"
"115740052-0-44253";"Any second now!"
"115740052-0-44254";"Quit pacing, Brahgas! Razhamad just had those tiles replaced."
"115740052-0-44255";"This isn't nerves, Sorinne. It's, uh … excitement! I always pace when I'm excited, you know that!"
"115740052-0-44256";"All right, I'm going to see if our opponents have arrived."
"115740052-0-44257";"Right, I need some fresh air. You should join me when you're ready. Our opponent should be here any moment now."
"115740052-0-44258";"It worked! We did it! Come on, let's get back to the tower."
"115740052-0-44261";"Well, let's get on with it. I, Varnauld Broch, chief novice of the glorious Wayrest Chapter, do hereby challenge the slovenly fishmongers of Gonfalon Bay to this first round of tournament play."
"115740052-0-44262";"So, you're off to Glenumbra. Nice of the Roister's Club to go easy on us in the first round."
"115740052-0-44263";"Hey, I heard that!"
"115740052-0-44265";"Look at Y'ffelon in the distance. I've never seen Mount Firesong so active."
"115740052-0-44266";"I see a ship mast ahead! That has to be the Prowler. Let's keep moving!"
"115740052-0-44267";"Rajjin's shadow, these Sea Elves are everywhere! Is this some kind of Pyandonean family reunion?"
"115740052-0-44268";"Jimila wants me to loose the arrow …. Me! I couldn't spear a whale if it landed on the quarterdeck! It will be fine, though. Yes. Totally fine."
"115740052-0-44269";"I cannot wait to get back out to sea. We've been on land far too long!"
"115740052-0-44271";"Dead Ascendant Order knights? They must have fallen to the lava creatures."
"115740052-0-44272";"You should have let the tides take you."
"115740052-0-44273";"Did you see that shot? A thing of beauty, that's what it was!"
"115740052-0-44274";"Sure, now everyone arrives. After I've already taken out the pirates. Typical."
"115740052-0-44275";"Well, if it isn't the Gonfalon gony! Marvelous!"
"115740052-0-44276";"What? How can—? All my careful planning—my strategies …. I can't lose! It's not possible!"
"115740052-0-44277";"Ha! This is a victory dance, Gelekh! For victorious feet, there are no rules!"
"115740052-0-44278";"Isn't that the truth! Hey, our friend is back. Come, join us!"
"115740052-0-44279";"The world is an excellent teacher for one of your talents, Ember. Do write me occasionally."
"115740052-0-44280";"I should go pack my things. And say goodbye to Huldressa! Ha! Not a chance."
"115740052-0-44281";"I heard the daughter is so distraught she's refusing to leave her rooms! So exciting!"
"115740052-0-44282";"Scandalous! No doubt Isobel is beside herself! Poor girls."
"115740052-0-44283";"If you help Isobel win the tournament, she could agree to marry Aurelia, then free her from the shortest engagement in history! Delicious!"
"115740052-0-44284";"Over here, dear. We have much to do."
"115740052-0-44285";"We need to protect the alliance leaders. Where are they?"
"115740052-0-44286";"Scattered, I'm afraid. Queen Ayrenn was with us, but there was a great rumble and screams from below. She ran to help."
"115740052-0-44287";"Go, my dear. Make sure Queen Ayrenn gets to Memorial Hall."
"115740052-0-44288";"Jakarn, help me sort things out here. We must hold the castle until help arrives!"
"115740052-0-44290";"Friend, these beasts and the Order's druid allies threaten everyone in the castle. They must not get by us!"
"115740052-0-44291";"Were they all fakes? I spent hundreds on your wares. Hundreds!"
"115740052-0-44292";"I never sold anything to you, I promise! You must've gotten that from someone else!"
"115740052-0-44293";"I didn't buy anything from any other merchant! Give me what I'm owed or I'll take it from your dead body!"
"115740052-0-44295";"Help! She's going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-44296";"It will take more than that playful splash to keep Za'ji from his treasure!"
"115740052-0-44297";"I'll catch up to you. I'll want to talk to Aurelia, make sure she is all right."
"115740052-0-44298";"Don't be annoyed. I … um. Did sort of follow along."
"115740052-0-44299";"Aurelia! What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-44300";"Lord Bacaro has arrived, duchess. He brought that Lady Arabelle with him."
"115740052-0-44301";"We can meet at the chapel. The entrance to the catacombs, and the key to get inside, are within."
"115740052-0-44302";"It's vast! Let's get our bearings. Try that hill to the left."
"115740052-0-44303";"Hey, good-looking, got a moment?"
"115740052-0-44304";"Now, that wasn't too difficult was it? Safe travels! I'm sure I'll see you soon."
"115740052-0-44305";"You'll be sorry that we couldn't come to an understanding here. Oh well. Have fun on the road!"
"115740052-0-44306";"I think this is the door to the ancient crypts. But we'll need a key."
"115740052-0-44307";"I'm in a bad mood. Your mark isn't worth enough now."
"115740052-0-44308";"You're lucky I just filled my purse. Get out of here. Before I look to refill it."
"115740052-0-44309";"Maybe … maybe I should've waited for an escort at Amenos Station with mother."
"115740052-0-44310";"Adventurer, since you're here anyway, we should speak. Come here!"
"115740052-0-44311";"La! At last someone has retrieved my gilded lute!"
"115740052-0-44312";"Come, follow me, away from this place. That ghastly mad spirit may return anon!"
"115740052-0-44313";"Hark, I shall serenade you on your way!"
"115740052-0-44314";"Oh Sir Brenvale did enter these halls with a heart full of song …."
"115740052-0-44315";"La! It did not take him long to hear the spirit's calls, oh!"
"115740052-0-44316";"He met the Mad Duke in combat. Oh ho! And they danced with swords all night long. La!"
"115740052-0-44317";"Alas Brenvale's skill was all for naught and the quest went all a-wrong. Oh!"
"115740052-0-44318";"And now you know the end of the tale! Oh ho! This is where I bid you … adieu!"
"115740052-0-44319";"I'm not sure it's chivalrous of me, but I hope that arse wastes the rest of the day looking for the hilt."
"115740052-0-44320";"I want to check on Aurelia first. I'll meet you at the old wayshrine along the road."
"115740052-0-44321";"We can meet up at the Navire Chapel. The entrance to the catacombs is in there."
"115740052-0-44322";"We've done it! All three trophies! Meet me near the tourney pavilion, and we'll present them together."
"115740052-0-44323";"She was amazing! I am so proud of you! Dame Isobel, what a nice ring to it!"
"115740052-0-44324";"Y'ffre, lend me your strength! Quell this earth!"
"115740052-0-44325";"Spirit of water, help us!  Quench this land!"
"115740052-0-44326";"The Ascendant Order must have overwhelmed them. The Lion Guard are no slouches."
"115740052-0-44327";"Definitely the Ascendant Order."
"115740052-0-44328";"The Ascendant Order will tear this place down to get to us. We're sitting ducks in here!"
"115740052-0-44329";"Spirits of the earth, help repair these vents!"
"115740052-0-44331";"Hey Yvara! Come and insult me to my face! I dare you!"
"115740052-0-44332";"If he cut through here … he went to the docks! I can't wait to get my hands on that skeever."
"115740052-0-44333";"What are you talking about, you big oaf?"
"115740052-0-44334";"You said I smell worse than a Wood Elf's rotmeth!"
"115740052-0-44335";"I said no such thing, but it's true. Your odor could knock out a mammoth!"
"115740052-0-44336";"Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Let's see how you smell without a nose!"
"115740052-0-44337";"You want a fight, big boy? I'll give you a fight!"
"115740052-0-44338";"That … was a bit creepy."
"115740052-0-44339";"Good luck to you both!"
"115740052-0-44340";"You there! Can we speak for a moment?"
"115740052-0-44341";"Ugh, what a horrid smell! Did someone leave that waste barrel open again?"
"115740052-0-44342";"Stendarr help us. I guess we're heading to Wayrest."
"115740052-0-44343";"This is just like a romance novel I read once."
"115740052-0-44345";"High King Emeric is in the courtyard through the eastern gate. Help him while I head to the hall."
"115740052-0-44346";"These reagents will form a powder that you can use to dispel the deadly enchantment. There!"
"115740052-0-44347";"You live … for now. Eventually, all will serve."
"115740052-0-44348";"Serve the crew of the damned!"
"115740052-0-44349";"Time for your belongings check, Yvara. Don't mind us."
"115740052-0-44350";"Hey, what's my locket doing in your bedroll?"
"115740052-0-44351";"Enough! You try my patience!"
"115740052-0-44352";"What? No! How'd that get—"
"115740052-0-44353";"That's it! Your status as a trusty is revoked and you're going to processing!"
"115740052-0-44354";"No! Not the jungle! I'm innocent!"
"115740052-0-44355";"Move! This platform is for trusties, not the common rabble. You'll be on your way to the jungle before you know it."
"115740052-0-44356";"Fool! You can't defeat the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-44357";"You can't hold out forever!"
"115740052-0-44362";"Die!"
"115740052-0-44363";"For the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-44364";"I will not fail the Champion!"
"115740052-0-44365";"You will fall!"
"115740052-0-44366";"Face me!"
"115740052-0-44367";"Protect the Ascendant Champion!"
"115740052-0-44368";"Do your worst!"
"115740052-0-44369";"You cannot hope to prevail!"
"115740052-0-44370";"I will gut you!"
"115740052-0-44371";"Bow to the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-44372";"You're weak!"
"115740052-0-44373";"Help! Someone help!"
"115740052-0-44374";"Goldleaf, you have to listen. That fetcher will just cut and run, the same as he did to us."
"115740052-0-44376";"Looks like our, uh. Friends are already here."
"115740052-0-44377";"Look, that ship! Hope they find peace where they're going."
"115740052-0-44378";"Thank you. I'm sure that'll feel better in a few day's time."
"115740052-0-44379";"If any more monsters throw rocks at me, I'll be ready for them."
"115740052-0-44380";"Loshu-Jat did not like the taste of that. But Loshu-Jat never likes potions."
"115740052-0-44384";"After you secure the royals, find a clear beach and fire that flare!"
"115740052-0-44385";"To the coin fort! Shall we journey there together, Ayrenn?"
"115740052-0-44386";"And … she's gone. Again. Don't worry about me. I'll just take the long way around."
"115740052-0-44387";"I could use a nice walk."
"115740052-0-44388";"Truth be told, this is one of the most relaxing diplomatic missions I've had in quite some time."
"115740052-0-44389";"Walker, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-44392";"Stay back, filthy beasts!"
"115740052-0-44393";"Thank you, it's already starting to ease my pain."
"115740052-0-44394";"You've made your thoughts clear. No one enters the dispensary."
"115740052-0-44395";"But we might find something in there we can use."
"115740052-0-44396";"You're a natural. One key down, one to go."
"115740052-0-44397";"Now we have all three keys! Let's return to the vault and see if we can open it."
"115740052-0-44398";"That marking on the rock face! It could be one of Oblan's smuggler marks. Take a look."
"115740052-0-44399";"Ah ha! Oblan left us a trail. This symbol means he went north."
"115740052-0-44400";"I think this is … east. Yes, he went east. I'm sure."
"115740052-0-44401";"Good another mark. We're on the right … wait. Do you hear that?"
"115740052-0-44402";"Look at that natural bridge ahead! I bet the view is delightful."
"115740052-0-44403";"I think I hear her bleating! We must be close!"
"115740052-0-44404";"Meryline, you proved more capable than I thought. Your mother was right in sending for you."
"115740052-0-44405";"I'm … capable? Does this mean you'll let me go on adventures?"
"115740052-0-44407";"Hey, friend! Down here!"
"115740052-0-44408";"Hey, you almost done in there? I can't keep this up forever."
"115740052-0-44409";"As much as this galls us, this is the prudent course. The Ascendant Order can't breach—"
"115740052-0-44410";"You think yourselves safe? I will bring this castle down on top of you!"
"115740052-0-44411";"You were saying, high king?"
"115740052-0-44413";"Knock on the walls with the hammer and chisel and look for a weak spot. Volcanic tunnels riddle these islands. There's bound to be one nearby."
"115740052-0-44414";"Release the torchbug into the vent. It's energy will help guide the ritual."
"115740052-0-44415";"Hmm, butterfly spirits are notoriously difficult to understand, but that was useful. I think. Let's continue."
"115740052-0-44416";"Dragonflies are such poets. The spirit mentioned a high concentration of magicka here. Worrying."
"115740052-0-44417";"The moth spirit says this is no natural phenomenon. And that it craves nectar."
"115740052-0-44418";"Let's speak."
"115740052-0-44419";"Speak with the duchess, dear. I'll have a look around."
"115740052-0-44420";"Ah, there you are. Find anything?"
"115740052-0-44421";"The wards are breached! To arms!"
"115740052-0-44422";"We can't stay here. He's trying to topple the castle!"
"115740052-0-44423";"Hiding in your hall? Then it shall be your tomb!"
"115740052-0-44424";"I've just about had it with this Ascendant Magus!"
"115740052-0-44425";"We did it, my friend! Look, we beat my wife to the extraction point! Smashing!"
"115740052-0-44426";"Climb, my friend, climb!"
"115740052-0-44427";"The duchess! Up the stairs, my dear!"
"115740052-0-44428";"Well done, both of you! Now stand back."
"115740052-0-44429";"All done. Now, let's find a cooler place to speak. I might melt if we stand here any longer."
"115740052-0-44430";"Hello? Please, help me!"
"115740052-0-44431";"Help me? I'm cursed. There's nothing to be done."
"115740052-0-44432";"There are things we can try. Let's talk on the way."
"115740052-0-44433";"The Steadfast. I thought you were willing to do what it took to end this war. Clearly, I was wrong."
"115740052-0-44434";"The first rounds of the Tales of Tribute tournament is about to begin!"
"115740052-0-44436";"Good to see these old stones again. Like my home away from home."
"115740052-0-44437";"Come, friend! The treasure awaits!"
"115740052-0-44438";"Aha! There's Nilsmon. Over there, on the beach."
"115740052-0-44439";"A knight does not nap when love is unrequited! No … wait. Sleep is good."
"115740052-0-44440";"Let's see if we can find a shipping clerk, my friend. They're back across the bridge, on the right."
"115740052-0-44441";"Are all the brine-crusted beef-wits of the Gonfalon Tribute Chapter here now? Ha! Only three, eh? And not a thimble's wit between you, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-44442";"I'll meet you at the extraction point, my friend!"
"115740052-0-44443";"Sorinne, how many times have I told you not to dance behind or on the bar? How many times?"
"115740052-0-44444";"One fine day in the middle of the night, two dead kings got up to fight. Back to back they faced each other, drew their bows, and stabbed themselves!"
"115740052-0-44445";"If you're done sulking, Ly, some assistance would be welcome."
"115740052-0-44446";"Fine, but only because I love to hear you beg for my help."
"115740052-0-44447";"So, just statistically speaking, what are the odds that we have to play the Mournhold Chapter next? They're low … right?"
"115740052-0-44448";"How's this for odds? There is a one-hundred percent chance that if you ask me again, I'm gonna break your legs."
"115740052-0-44449";"Mate, report. Where's Aurelia?"
"115740052-0-44450";"You don't look to be fairing any better than I did, Turli."
"115740052-0-44451";"Less talk and more action, Ly. And do try harder this time, please."
"115740052-0-44452";"I will take care of this!"
"115740052-0-44453";"Great work, but questions still remain. I shall return to my order and report all that has happened. Until we meet again."
"115740052-0-44454";"Aurelia! Thank the gods. Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-44455";"Sorinne probably took her sweet to the docks. If you see her, tell her Raenobi has more to offer … if she is interested."
"115740052-0-44456";"The Redguard there must be our merchant, Izbadd. Merchant my scaly Argonian arse."
"115740052-0-44457";"Not your finest hour, Ly. Let me show you how it's done."
"115740052-0-44458";"I just need to catch my breath. Besides, you looked bored hiding up there."
"115740052-0-44459";"I'll be in the tower working on the counterspell. Come find me when you're done."
"115740052-0-44460";"I don't wish to hog all the excitement. Turli, why don't you get in on the action?"
"115740052-0-44461";"I'm always cleaning up after you, Ly."
"115740052-0-44462";"That was a limp performance, Turli. I'll show them what true power is."
"115740052-0-44463";"You'll be crying for my help soon enough."
"115740052-0-44464";"I don't want to finish them off before you get a crack at them, Ly."
"115740052-0-44465";"Allow me to demonstrate what winning looks like."
"115740052-0-44466";"Come on, Turli, let's secure the victory."
"115740052-0-44467";"Fine, but I lead the card on our next bout."
"115740052-0-44468";"It would seem my bad luck has rubbed off on you, Ly."
"115740052-0-44469";"Enough heckling from the stands! Let's put an end to this together."
"115740052-0-44470";"There you are! Z'en's price, I thought I was going to be the only one out here! Our opponents will be here any—"
"115740052-0-44471";"Greetings, walkers. Oh, Raenobi thought there would be more of you. Shame. Well, the games must go on, yes?"
"115740052-0-44472";"This one, Raenobi, adjutant game-baron of the Elden Root Chapter, hereby challenge the Gonfalon Bay players in this intermediate tournament!"
"115740052-0-44473";"Always playing the same tricks, aren't you, Raenobi?"
"115740052-0-44474";"Oh, Sorinne. What a surprise! How did you enjoy this one's gift? Smooth and fragrant, yes?"
"115740052-0-44475";"I wouldn't know. You'll have to ask the fish at the bottom of the harbor."
"115740052-0-44476";"That can't be good for them …."
"115740052-0-44477";"I suggest you get ready for the tournament, Raenobi. We'll be seeing you soon."
"115740052-0-44478";"Glowing plants and … water? Not something I expected from a place called the Firepot."
"115740052-0-44479";"This cave is enormous. Oh— don't look down!"
"115740052-0-44480";"How is there this much water here? I thought everything would be dead!"
"115740052-0-44481";"Wow. This place is surprisingly … beautiful. Tarrinore would love this view!"
"115740052-0-44482";"All right, let's get you two back to your regular chicken selves."
"115740052-0-44483";"Ha, I knew it would work! Run along, ladies."
"115740052-0-44484";"<Buh-gaw!>"
"115740052-0-44485";"No, my pet! I'll kill you!"
"115740052-0-44486";"What've we got here? An audience?"
"115740052-0-44487";"Fresh challengers more like."
"115740052-0-44488";"Shame the usual crowd isn't here to watch us slaughter them."
"115740052-0-44489";"Their screams will have to substitute for cheering."
"115740052-0-44490";"Let's put on a show!"
"115740052-0-44491";"Ha! Look at what the senches dragged in! This one is sorry you had to make such a long trip just to lose."
"115740052-0-44492";"Kra! You are better than this one thought. But one victory means little, yes? Neither of your friends will best Raenobi."
"115740052-0-44493";"Still so overconfident. That's why you're going to lose. Again."
"115740052-0-44494";"Awful lot of talk about those idols and tome …."
"115740052-0-44495";"Ziss on you, Sorinne! You will not be so lucky as your so-called friend."
"115740052-0-44496";"There's the smithy! Everything we need should be inside."
"115740052-0-44497";"We have the hilt, now we need a head. I suggest we make for the prison warrens, on the north side of the tower. We should find an executioner's block we can use."
"115740052-0-44498";"Captain? Is that you in there, my love?"
"115740052-0-44499";"Look who's back! Didn't take too long, did it?"
"115740052-0-44500";"Hey, look what the gulls dragged in."
"115740052-0-44501";"I swear, Sorinne, I've never seen anything like it. She was so mad by the time I got there, she just flipped the table and walked away!"
"115740052-0-44502";"Honestly, I only poured salt in an open wound. Our friend here is the one who really twisted her tail!"
"115740052-0-44503";"There's lingering doubt about this book. Regrets are a lost soul's anchor."
"115740052-0-44504";"I can feel the dread clinging to this one."
"115740052-0-44505";"I can still hear that mad bastard's words hanging in the air."
"115740052-0-44507";"Look, up there. If I were a key, I'd hide up there."
"115740052-0-44508";"That's our signal! To the ship, everyone!"
"115740052-0-44509";"Nereid's Song is ours, Lady Arabelle!"
"115740052-0-44510";"Excellent! Set course for All Flags Islet. There's no time to waste!"
"115740052-0-44511";"My power is as vast as the sea itself!"
"115740052-0-44513";"Let's meet back inside the chapel. The catacombs entrance is down the stairs."
"115740052-0-44514";"The so-called leaders of the failed alliances. Prepare to fall to the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-44515";"I've never been this far into the catacombs. What a story this will make!"
"115740052-0-44516";"They say that Sir Brenvale died at the hands of a ghost. The old Mad Duke! Gives me the shivers."
"115740052-0-44517";"You're back. Carrying feathers and branches and flowers, I hope."
"115740052-0-44518";"Cat's paw, beautiful."
"115740052-0-44519";"A spriggan's veil, powerful symbolism."
"115740052-0-44520";"Majestic birds, right up until you're cleaning scat off the docks."
"115740052-0-44522";"Can you talk to him? I'm all … sweaty."
"115740052-0-44523";"Hahaha. Thank you, you old goat. Still thinking of me all these years later."
"115740052-0-44524";"Come here, lass. No need to dawdle near the door like you're still a squire."
"115740052-0-44525";"Hello? Isobel?"
"115740052-0-44526";"He said it's out back. Imagine being that casual about something so precious."
"115740052-0-44528";"He said it's outside here, somewhere. \n\nImagine being that casual about a rare artifact like the Staff of the Wild Woods."
"115740052-0-44531";"I will feast on your flesh."
"115740052-0-44532";"I will have my vengeance."
"115740052-0-44533";"Your blood smells sweet. I think I'll have a taste."
"115740052-0-44534";"Ahh! First a curse, now a ghost! Oh, talk to Lady Laurent, please. I'm much too upset for rational discourse."
"115740052-0-44535";"Oh dear! Follow Lady Laurent! She's in no condition to wander off on her own!"
"115740052-0-44537";"There you are, dear. And with the alliance leaders, too! I assume you had something to do with the Ascendant Order's retreat?"
"115740052-0-44538";"Begone, brother. I plan to dock with my lady love and this boat has no need of a third oar."
"115740052-0-44539";"Brother? Third oar? M'lady, you're confused …."
"115740052-0-44540";"Ah, there you are, my turtle dove! Come to me, my darling! I've missed you so!"
"115740052-0-44541";"The ghost woman. She's inside you, friend. The captain thinks you're her. Talk to m'lady and play along. See what you can learn."
"115740052-0-44542";"Second, over here. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-44543";"Come on now Berjo, put some muscle into it."
"115740052-0-44544";"Ah, there's the entrance to the cove. Just remember, friend … Sea Elves. Buckets of them. We should try to keep things quiet."
"115740052-0-44545";"These Sea Elves have really made themselves at home, eh? Bah. No sailor worth her salt would stay on land this long."
"115740052-0-44546";"There's Druid Mylo. He has the eyes of an eagle. If anyone around here saw anything, it would be him."
"115740052-0-44547";"Oh yes, the lighthouse! It's full of historical information. What a good idea, m'lady!"
"115740052-0-44548";"Examine the historical plaques and see what you make of them."
"115740052-0-44549";"The Undergrove? No one but the archdruid ever goes down there."
"115740052-0-44550";"These catacombs have been built up over generations. Might be a bit twisty down here."
"115740052-0-44551";"Hello, is that you all with my sword? Or a spider? If you're a spider, please leave!"
"115740052-0-44552";"Farewell, farewell!"
"115740052-0-44553";"A ritual? That's proof that a druid caused this problem. Look, there's a mistake in the second line. They wrote remove instead of restore!"
"115740052-0-44554";"You're stronger than you look, but this ends now! Slow them down, Turli."
"115740052-0-44555";"Clip their wings for me, Turli! I'll handle the rest."
"115740052-0-44556";"Keep these rats from nipping at my heels for a moment, Ly."
"115740052-0-44557";"Enough! Tie an anchor to these vermin, Ly."
"115740052-0-44561";"Oh, hello, dear. Captain Kaleen was about to tell us her plan. Why don't you ask her how she wants to proceed."
"115740052-0-44562";"Hmm. When I spoke to the archdruid, it seemed like that was the first she heard of the corruption in the grove."
"115740052-0-44563";"I feel sorry for any Sea Elves that get between me and my ship!"
"115740052-0-44564";"The queen is in danger!"
"115740052-0-44565";"I thought you'd never ask."
"115740052-0-44566";"Of course, but you owe me."
"115740052-0-44567";"It warms me to feel needed."
"115740052-0-44568";"Anything for my dear brother."
"115740052-0-44569";"Barging into a lady's private chambers. You are bold."
"115740052-0-44570";"But I won't be conquered so easily."
"115740052-0-44571";"Let me show you the power that's going to crush that little flotilla of yours."
"115740052-0-44572";"Ah yes, the Thrassian Plague. Terrible disease, simply terrible. I was lucky. So many others … not so much."
"115740052-0-44573";"I remember the Baron-Admiral quite fondly. Excellent leader. I would have followed him anywhere—and I suppose I did."
"115740052-0-44574";"Ah, what a sight, when the first ships of the All Flags Navy sailed into the upgraded harbor. I was aboard one of those vessels … and it was here that I met my lady love!"
"115740052-0-44575";"So many lost. But even as my ship sank beneath the waves, I knew that victory was in our grasp."
"115740052-0-44576";"Tobin Moorcroft? I know that name … my brother—yes! Yes, the master builder was my brother!"
"115740052-0-44577";"Ah! The ghost woman! At least she's no longer inside you, my friend. See what she wants. I am much too frightened to approach such an apparition."
"115740052-0-44578";"Tobin Moorcroft? Oh, this is all that wretched scoundrel's fault!"
"115740052-0-44579";"The inn? The building at the center of the islet? I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go look …."
"115740052-0-44580";"Secure this landing! It's time to bring the landing force home. What's your report, marine?"
"115740052-0-44581";"Pack it in! We can scour the island once the rest of the Dreadsail fleet lines the ocean floor!"
"115740052-0-44582";"I'll be fine. I just need a moment. Sea Elf magicks are always so particular."
"115740052-0-44585";"More of you vile Serpents to fight? Good! I'm just getting started!"
"115740052-0-44586";"Hmm. You don't appear to be one of these Green Serpent ruffians. Shame. I was hoping to notch an even twenty."
"115740052-0-44587";"Look around. Irnskar was here before they moved him, I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-44588";"The Skald-King's axe! Irnskar held that like Queen Maraya grips a sweetroll. He wouldn't give it up willingly."
"115740052-0-44589";"Fights like a Giant? That sounds like Irnskar, and he's at the coin fort. Well done!"
"115740052-0-44590";"Let's find Queen Ayrenn, shall we?"
"115740052-0-44591";"All that dead lout had was this bottle of wine."
"115740052-0-44592";"Ach. Sour. Is there no joy on this damn island?"
"115740052-0-44593";"Yeah, if I were to break an ankle making this jump, Queen Maraya would kill me. I'll go around and meet you outside."
"115740052-0-44594";"Good to see you still well, Emeric."
"115740052-0-44595";"And you, Ayrenn. Nice … cat. I say, friend, let's chat."
"115740052-0-44596";"Caska will run ahead and clear the path. I'll make my own way there."
"115740052-0-44597";"I remember this place! Janne and I shared many pleasant encounters beneath this roof before I set sail with the fleet."
"115740052-0-44598";"Oh no, sir! Absolutely not!"
"115740052-0-44599";"Lady Janne seems to think one of us is someone untoward. Talk to her, my friend."
"115740052-0-44600";"Hey! Over here!"
"115740052-0-44601";"Bear witness! Tamriel's salvation begins today! Join us or be swept aside!"
"115740052-0-44602";"Storm and fire will bring down the old regimes. Lightning and lava will herald in a new age!"
"115740052-0-44603";"Now hurry up and get to the Prowler! I'll meet you and the others there!"
"115740052-0-44604";"Look! The Colossus!"
"115740052-0-44605";"These tremors grow more powerful. I heard that volcanic fissures are bursting open across the isles."
"115740052-0-44606";"First a storm, now this? It must be the work of the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-44607";"You give them too much credit. An earthquake destroyed the Gonfalon Colossus."
"115740052-0-44608";"Yes, an Ascendant earthquake! Trust Za'ji. He knows!"
"115740052-0-44609";"High King Emeric is no one's prisoner!"
"115740052-0-44610";"That's one of the nobles Deesh-Jee wants! Unlock the gate and grab him!"
"115740052-0-44611";"Get them!"
"115740052-0-44612";"Look, I don't have the gold yet. But I'm close to winning. I've got a side bet that will cover everything I owe!"
"115740052-0-44613";"Janne is mine, little brother! Go play with your hammer and chisels. My sweet deserves a night to remember before I set sail from Port Sargo."
"115740052-0-44614";"In debt to us and making even more bets you can't cover? Pathetic. You don't even know who you're up against."
"115740052-0-44615";"It doesn't matter. I'm going to win. I have to!"
"115740052-0-44616";"Optimism. The gambler's eternal foe. Don't even think about running when you fail, Brahgas. We will find you."
"115740052-0-44617";"A night to remember? But … but …. Anyway, Port Sargo, that's the old dock on the eastern shore of this very islet!"
"115740052-0-44618";"The Ascendant Order won't make good on their promise if he's dead, netch-breath."
"115740052-0-44619";"I knew the archipelago's islands were volcanic, but I didn't realize they were still so active!"
"115740052-0-44621";"Come on, let's get you out of here before you manage to get more burns."
"115740052-0-44622";"The ruins of Port Sargo. Somewhat disconcerting, as long-deserted places tend to be. But there's a plaque. See what it says."
"115740052-0-44623";"Hmm, the Pristine Halberd. The captain's name has been scratched off the plaques on the pedestal and on the wall."
"115740052-0-44625";"Druid Audrine? An Elder? And mediator to the—oh, very well."
"115740052-0-44626";"It feels good to be armed again! I've missed you, Suungir!"
"115740052-0-44627";"Enough! Let's get down there! Arghh!"
"115740052-0-44628";"Go on, find a way outside so you can signal the ship. I need a moment. Guess I'm not as recovered as I thought."
"115740052-0-44629";"Shor's bones, they'll see that light all the way back in Windhelm! Let's get to the dock."
"115740052-0-44630";"Here to see me off, little brother? How touching!"
"115740052-0-44631";"Baron-Admiral Bendu, my vessel is ready to sail as soon as you give the word."
"115740052-0-44632";"Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo was in charge of the All Flags Navy! Pretend to be the admiral and perhaps the captain will reveal his name."
"115740052-0-44633";"Captain Renwic Moorcroft! My beloved's true name! You must add my beloved's name to the main garden monument before we forget it again!"
"115740052-0-44635";"That's not going to happen! Only the hammer and chisels of I, Tobin Moorcroft, can carve those tablets! I hid them where they will never be found!"
"115740052-0-44636";"That gravestone! That's what I saw in Tobin's mind! Dig there!"
"115740052-0-44637";"Wait till the lads hear about this! Ho ho!"
"115740052-0-44638";"Yes, yes, we're all very happy. We'll have time to celebrate after we weigh anchor. Unlock the wheel, my friend, and let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-44639";"Great work, now get us out of this cove and to a nearby shore!"
"115740052-0-44640";"Onto the ship, quickly!"
"115740052-0-44641";"Aye! Give the word, friend, and we'll set sail!"
"115740052-0-44642";"You have the tools? Quickly, carve my beloved's name into the plaque at the Memorial Garden. Once his name is added to the central monument, we will never forget him again."
"115740052-0-44643";"A dedication ceremony? For me? How exciting!"
"115740052-0-44644";"Captain Renwic Moorcroft of the Pristine Halberd. Place my beloved's name where it belongs."
"115740052-0-44645";"Oh, you do it, friend. My hands are shaking, I'm so nervous!"
"115740052-0-44646";"Oh well done, my turtle dove! You saved my memory. Now we can be together for all eternity."
"115740052-0-44647";"I did have a little help, Renwic, my love. Now come, my darling. We have a lot of catching up to do!"
"115740052-0-44648";"Stibbons! Why do I think this was somehow your fault? Oh, never mind. You. Come talk to me."
"115740052-0-44649";"There. I recharged the medallions. They can be returned to the delegates."
"115740052-0-44650";"What a strange magic."
"115740052-0-44651";"Until next time, my friend."
"115740052-0-44652";"Stibbons! Come here, my manservant. All this foolishness about forgotten love has given me an itch. I am in need of a good scratch."
"115740052-0-44653";"M'lady! I could never—well, if you insist …."
"115740052-0-44654";"Another tremor. Step carefully, dear."
"115740052-0-44655";"Sister, we can't just threaten everyone into becoming druids. We need these good folks to appreciate the woods, not fear them."
"115740052-0-44656";"You fool. No one appreciates the forest on their own. I know these merchants, they'll take all they can and leave the land a husk."
"115740052-0-44657";"I don't remember seeing this in the travel brochure. Are you certain it's part of the tour? Looks quite dull to me."
"115740052-0-44659";"Surprised to see you out here, Razhamad. And with an empty cup no less!"
"115740052-0-44660";"Ha! It is the final round! What kind of game-baron would I be if I did not cheer the chapter on? Ah, it looks like your opponents are here."
"115740052-0-44661";"Damn …. It's them. I knew it."
"115740052-0-44662";"Oh, I thought you'd be happy to see us, my dear Brahgas. You needn't take this so seriously. It is just a game. Right?"
"115740052-0-44663";"Honor to you, Razhamad. I, Teliv Fels, champion of the Mournhold Chapter, have come to extend the final tournament challenge."
"115740052-0-44664";"Well done, Aspirant Veloise."
"115740052-0-44665";"Wonderful! Now … perhaps we could hear a poem or ditty about the adventure, Aspirant?"
"115740052-0-44666";"The Oaken Order commends you, Aspirant."
"115740052-0-44668";"Careful, I don't think that letter you found will work down here. We're going to have to fight."
"115740052-0-44669";"I hear water ahead. Didn't Lady Arabelle mention an underground river?"
"115740052-0-44670";"There, that rock with the two points. Didn't that greedy skeever say twin spires?"
"115740052-0-44673";"Steward, have you seen Count Damard or Duchess Elea?"
"115740052-0-44674";"Jakarn, take a look around the docks. Just in case."
"115740052-0-44675";"Now, b'vek, I wish you all fair hands and good fortune in this final tournament. Especially you, Brahgas."
"115740052-0-44676";"Eat moss, Teliv."
"115740052-0-44677";"Brahgas! A word."
"115740052-0-44678";"The Steadfast don't have many warriors. We're a humanitarian group. It may take some time, but I'll rally what I can."
"115740052-0-44679";"Then I'll find you the time you need. While you gather your forces, I'll do what I can to delay the attack."
"115740052-0-44680";"The Ascendant Order will expect us to reinforce All Flags Islet."
"115740052-0-44681";"I'll think of something. I always do."
"115740052-0-44682";"sweet music plays."
"115740052-0-44683";"Shipwreck Shoals is on the northern coast, just west of the Dufort Shipyards."
"115740052-0-44684";"I yearned to see my home one last time, but I never anticipated I'd see it from the inside of a satchel."
"115740052-0-44685";"Squires prayed at this alter under the watchful eyes of these statues. Hopefully, the statues will favor us as well."
"115740052-0-44686";"Once, this courtyard was filled with talk and laughter. Now all I can hear is the clanking of items in your pack."
"115740052-0-44687";"As squires, Leobert and I fell asleep praying in front of that statue."
"115740052-0-44688";"With the chapel so removed from our daily lives, only those undergoing the rites of passage knelt at the altar here."
"115740052-0-44689";"Leobert's chamber. Not even the altar within could return the knight commander to his senses."
"115740052-0-44690";"Hey! You made it!"
"115740052-0-44691";"Bah! Three curse this game!"
"115740052-0-44692";"So, we have a deal then?"
"115740052-0-44693";"We do. Don't fret, Razhamad. This won't take long."
"115740052-0-44694";"What, Teliv? Come to take a peek at the future title-holder's strategy?"
"115740052-0-44695";"Someone in your precarious position might do well to make fewer boasts, Brahgas."
"115740052-0-44696";"I … lost."
"115740052-0-44697";"And with that, your sad, redemptive fantasy meets its end. Do not try to run, Brahgas."
"115740052-0-44698";"Wait! You and Razhamad had a deal!"
"115740052-0-44699";"Yes. A deal that remains unresolved. Until it's settled, Brahgas belongs to me."
"115740052-0-44700";"Sorinne, no! I'll go with him. A deal … a deal's a deal."
"115740052-0-44701";"I hope this song brings your spirits peace."
"115740052-0-44702";"Are you interested in tales of valor? My courage has taken me throughout the Archipelago. Let me entertain you a moment."
"115740052-0-44703";"Do not pull this one into your argument. He is confused."
"115740052-0-44704";"A raft though? We'll be dashed against the rocks before we make it a hundred yards! You're with me, right?"
"115740052-0-44705";"If you'll just listen. My plan will work, I promise you. I don't belong on this island!"
"115740052-0-44706";"I saw it myself. The light at Gonfalon Head went out, right around the same time as that storm! They say rogue knights threatened the keeper."
"115740052-0-44707";"The Ascendant Order. The same ruffians drove most of the salvagers away from the Shallows. It's not safe to walk the loch."
"115740052-0-44708";"The charges include larceny, goat smuggling, fraud, and excessive use of profanity in the presence of nobility!"
"115740052-0-44709";"Did you see what happened? An earthquake destroyed the Colossus of Gonfalon while the nobles were having a party!"
"115740052-0-44710";"The statue of the Baron-Admiral, destroyed. Bad winds are coming to High Isle. Bad winds indeed."
"115740052-0-44711";"Goat smuggling and offending her ladyship? I'm a feared criminal and you charge me with that?"
"115740052-0-44712";"It doesn't make sense. This Ascendant Order is tearing the island apart, looking for something they think washed ashore."
"115740052-0-44713";"Well, I hope they find it and go back to the mainland. I've had enough of rogue knights and gawkers from Tamriel."
"115740052-0-44714";"I heard important visitors were rescued from Amenos. They're here for Lord Bacaro's conference!"
"115740052-0-44715";"Any idea what that conference is all about? The nobles are being real secretive as to the actual purpose of this meeting."
"115740052-0-44716";"The Ascendant Order tried to kidnap Duchess Elea! I heard some mainlander hero saved her!"
"115740052-0-44717";"Mainlanders! I suppose they're good for something. Now if they could figure out how to calm down  Mount Firesong …."
"115740052-0-44718";"I can't believe it. An Ascendant Order sailed a fleet right into the loch! I heard there was a terrible battle at All Flags Islet."
"115740052-0-44719";"And I heard that the important visitors were there. And they turned out to be the leaders of the three alliances! Good thing someone was there to defend them."
"115740052-0-44720";"Did you hear? Lord Bacaro's conference. It's peace talks to try to end the Three Banners War."
"115740052-0-44721";"Good luck with that! They may have worked together to stop the Ascendant Order, but they won't stop trying to kill each other until one of them sits on the Ruby Throne."
"115740052-0-44722";"Away with you, filthy flea-bitten creature!"
"115740052-0-44723";"It's like me mum used to say. Long as there's a drink in my hand, I'm in the right place."
"115740052-0-44724";"You retrieved every item. Had I hands, I would clasp yours in friendship. Leave this cursed keep to the dead."
"115740052-0-44725";"Place the items you dutifully recovered in that grave. Leobert will never leave his Keep now."
"115740052-0-44726";"Now, refill the grave with dirt. It's time the mistakes of the past were buried."
"115740052-0-44727";"Now no one will suspect what this grave hides. I'd like to be laid to rest atop that tombstone, if you don't mind putting me there."
"115740052-0-44728";"Screaming away in terror."
"115740052-0-44730";"What was all that about nobles lost in the jungle?"
"115740052-0-44731";"I don't know. Something about shipwrecks from the freak storm. But I heard someone went out there and saved them!"
"115740052-0-44732";"Did you hear? The Green Serpents signed on with some noble wizard. Calls himself the Ascendant Magus. I think they were involved in the trouble in the jungle."
"115740052-0-44733";"Aren't the Green Serpents involved in most of the trouble that happens in the jungle?"
"115740052-0-44734";"Teliv, I warn you. If you hurt Brahgas, you will regret it."
"115740052-0-44735";"Brahgas belongs to me, Razhamad. You have more pressing concerns when it comes to property, I think. Your precious gaming hall, for instance."
"115740052-0-44736";"Of course, your prodigy here still has a chance to reverse your fortunes!"
"115740052-0-44737";"Razhamad … you bet the hall? Y'ffre's viney arse, what were you thinking?"
"115740052-0-44738";"Peace, Brahgas. Or shall I remind you of the penalty for speaking out of turn?"
"115740052-0-44739";"It seems there was an attack on All Flag Islet. The Ascendant Order. Same rogue knights who stirred up all that trouble in the jungle."
"115740052-0-44740";"All Flags? Why would anyone attack that old place? It's nothing but memories and rotting memorials to something that happened a long time ago."
"115740052-0-44741";"I heard that the nobles turned out to be High King Emeric and some other royals. They had a party in Gonfalon Bay."
"115740052-0-44742";"And we weren't invited? Feh. Everything good happens on High Isle, not Amenos."
"115740052-0-44743";"You … beat me."
"115740052-0-44744";"Ha! Go kiss a kwama's arse, Teliv! Our new champion beat you fair and square!"
"115740052-0-44745";"As per our agreement, Gonfalon Bay now hosts the newest Tribute champion. Release Brahgas. Now."
"115740052-0-44746";"Razhamad … if you read the contract, I think you'll find—"
"115740052-0-44747";"The contract is final. If you want to dispute it, our newest Tribute champion has a skill set beyond simple card games. I am sure they'd be happy to put it on display if you try anything."
"115740052-0-44748";"Brahgas … you may go."
"115740052-0-44749";"Like I need your permission!"
"115740052-0-44750";"Congratulations … champion."
"115740052-0-44751";"You hear the spirits are loose from Ghost Haven Bay? Two crews come into harbor claiming they saw a ghost ship!"
"115740052-0-44752";"How does a ship have a ghost?"
"115740052-0-44753";"Brokerock Mine is finally back in service. I heard the prison labor was back in force now that those crab monsters are mostly under control."
"115740052-0-44754";"I hear some of those creatures are good eating!"
"115740052-0-44755";"This will keep you out of Amunara's fur until she gets the shield."
"115740052-0-44756";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-44757";"If you're quite ready, my dears, I believe it's time to finish this business."
"115740052-0-44758";"Tides swallow her! Ah … traveler, may I ask a favor?"
"115740052-0-44759";"I can't believe you drank our entire stock!"
"115740052-0-44760";"Me? Where's your proof?"
"115740052-0-44761";"Just because I—hic—woke up in a pile of bottles doesn't mean I'm guilty! Those could have been—hic—gotten there in any number of ways!"
"115740052-0-44762";"Good luck! You're my hero!"
"115740052-0-44763";"Look, Genalda! They're back! Friend, give my lovely partner the ingredients!"
"115740052-0-44764";"Give me a moment to mix up just a little to test."
"115740052-0-44765";"Here, Hilgrim, give this a try. You're already drunk."
"115740052-0-44766";"Hmm, maybe a bit more spice?"
"115740052-0-44767";"The Tribute Champion returns! Huzzah! Welcome home!"
"115740052-0-44768";"Three cheers for our very own Tribute Champion! Three cheers, I say!"
"115740052-0-44769";"The hero of Gonfalon Chapter! Cheers!"
"115740052-0-44770";"Aye! Cheers to the best of us!"
"115740052-0-44771";"Ziss'vo! Would you all quiet down? Kishka has work to do, yes? But yes, cheers to you walker."
"115740052-0-44772";"I could hear the cheers from up here. Welcome back, champion!"
"115740052-0-44773";"Now I'll gladly answer your questions. Hmm … you should hold on to that censer."
"115740052-0-44774";"You are formidable! But let us see how you handle this!"
"115740052-0-44775";"Hold on, friend! I've got something for that beast!"
"115740052-0-44776";"All right, it's loaded! Show me what to target and I'll make it count!"
"115740052-0-44777";"This is the place. Let's chat before we rush in."
"115740052-0-44778";"Nice work! I've got maybe one shot left up here. Hit 'em again!"
"115740052-0-44779";"Enough! Time to end this. I call upon the strength of the mountain!"
"115740052-0-44780";"He's conjuring something big! Ward yourself with my magic!"
"115740052-0-44781";"Hurry now! Find a way to the Shield Hall!"
"115740052-0-44782";"Who're you? Another mercenary?"
"115740052-0-44783";"Ignore her poisonous words! Stay true to your honor!"
"115740052-0-44784";"Say goodbye to the shield, ghost-knight!"
"115740052-0-44785";"Pick up the pace, squire! We must hasten to our next adventure! Where do your scribbles lead?"
"115740052-0-44786";"Scribbles? I had to draw that map because you left the road to chase a fictional Dragon! It's not my fault we're lost."
"115740052-0-44787";"This one's binding failed? I worked hard to make that!"
"115740052-0-44788";"Hmm. Quickly, enter the first trial."
"115740052-0-44789";"No! I can't fail now!"
"115740052-0-44790";"I'll summon the storm myself!"
"115740052-0-44791";"The storm's growing stronger! We have to stop him!"
"115740052-0-44792";"More beasts! I'll deal with them!"
"115740052-0-44793";"He's drawing in too much power, but you and Emeric together can beat him. Help Emeric with those creatures!"
"115740052-0-44794";"Now's the moment! Give the word!"
"115740052-0-44795";"Welcome to your first test—the Trial of Perseverance."
"115740052-0-44796";"Now! Get close to the Magus and brace yourselves!"
"115740052-0-44797";"This had better work, Ayrenn!"
"115740052-0-44798";"Enough with the games! We should be out there doing something!"
"115740052-0-44799";"Ever hear the old proverb? Opportunity arrives while Khajiit takes nap."
"115740052-0-44800";"That doesn't even make any sense!"
"115740052-0-44801";"It does when Za'ji's feet are tired."
"115740052-0-44803";"One captain is good. But two is even better, yes?"
"115740052-0-44804";"Make that three."
"115740052-0-44805";"I can't ask you to join me in this."
"115740052-0-44806";"You are not asking. Za'ji is telling."
"115740052-0-44807";"Looks like I found a crew! Head to Jheury's Cove, friend. We'll collect Lady Arabelle and meet you there."
"115740052-0-44808";"That should be enough."
"115740052-0-44809";"I think I remember how to make this. Been a while."
"115740052-0-44810";"Oh, fish biscuits, the smell is going to make me throw up. Almost done."
"115740052-0-44811";"Here, maybe you can carry this. I hate the smell."
"115740052-0-44812";"Oh good, you're back. What do you want now?"
"115740052-0-44813";"Malacath's crusty arse! What was that?"
"115740052-0-44814";"They handed Silverslip over to vampires? Bastards! Come on, let's get to Shadowfen."
"115740052-0-44815";"To the door! The Ascendant Order is breaking in!"
"115740052-0-44816";"It's just us, Valessea. Stand down!"
"115740052-0-44817";"Don't you dare pity me, Ember."
"115740052-0-44818";"She never could deal with kindness or pity at all."
"115740052-0-44819";"Those stairs lead up to the battlements and Irnskar. I'll clear a path to the hall."
"115740052-0-44820";"Use your medallion! It's the only way past the wards."
"115740052-0-44821";"Let me send word to Jhaka before you find him in Marbruk. Just so he's prepared."
"115740052-0-44822";"Hah, probably a good idea. I'd hate to scare the stripes off him."
"115740052-0-44823";"Yes … I am finally free. I leave you a gift, Tribute champion. Bless you."
"115740052-0-44824";"Quite a victory—and a truly joyous reunion. Here. I believe these cards will be a welcome addition to you collection. Farewell."
"115740052-0-44825";"Now, that was a match! By Mauloch, I'll need a few hours in the coffin after a thrashing like that. Take this, champ—you earned it."
"115740052-0-44826";"Marvelous! An unexpected strategy executed to perfection. I'd say that's earned you my respect. And a gift from the Club!"
"115740052-0-44828";"This one doesn't care if the ghost-knight frightened you! Find a path to the Shield Hall!"
"115740052-0-44829";"At long last …. What a joy it is to be known. Cherish this gift, champion. Few will ever accomplish what you accomplished today."
"115740052-0-44830";"Surely we're done now? I could use a drink and a meal."
"115740052-0-44831";"It must have been tough getting captured by convicts on Amenos."
"115740052-0-44832";"Good point, Ayrenn. But do remember, he's only a prince."
"115740052-0-44833";"Raise a hand if you care what the high king thinks!"
"115740052-0-44834";"Thank you, Za'ji."
"115740052-0-44835";"Za'ji cares. Can we go home now?"
"115740052-0-44836";"Wrong royal, Za'ji. We're with the queen, remember? Now where did we leave that scow we stole?"
"115740052-0-44837";"What, did no one tie up the ship before we ran into battle?"
"115740052-0-44839";"We're near the shore now. Maybe tunneling here angered the Hadolids? The entryway has to be close!"
"115740052-0-44840";"Seek and destroy, my pets!"
"115740052-0-44841";"Oh! Friend! I have an idea!"
"115740052-0-44842";"Water? This tunnel must be the deepest one. Look for some loose dirt to place the crystals."
"115740052-0-44843";"More enemies approach."
"115740052-0-44844";"Quickly, into the hall!"
"115740052-0-44845";"What a beautiful sky!"
"115740052-0-44846";"Quickly, this way."
"115740052-0-44847";"A strong first step."
"115740052-0-44848";"A wise sailor learns from their mistakes. Try once again."
"115740052-0-44849";"Come, friends. We should return to Gonfalon Bay. Revels await!"
"115740052-0-44850";"This is it. Let's look around for a clue about Song."
"115740052-0-44851";"Mother of all fish biscuits, look at this place!"
"115740052-0-44853";"The Trial of Wits begins here. Observe the four tablets around the room. In the proper order, they will light your path."
"115740052-0-44854";"Could be something from our thief. If he didn't hear it hit the ground, he was probably moving quickly."
"115740052-0-44855";"I've been making some experimental alchemical mixtures and I'd love to try them out on Kiv."
"115740052-0-44857";"Don't be surprised if you see me in Wayrest. That fetcher deserves some payback."
"115740052-0-44858";"Are you Julles? I can tell by your face that fetcher left you in the lurch."
"115740052-0-44859";"Oh no. You poor thing! That dastardly man, how could he?"
"115740052-0-44860";"I decided these two have the right idea. You want to help track him down? I plan to make sure he remembers me."
"115740052-0-44861";"By the Eight you're right. Self-pity serves no one. Young lady, Kiv has gone to Belkarth. Let's go."
"115740052-0-44862";"Let's meet at the Navire Docks, dears. They're just south of the castle."
"115740052-0-44863";"Read the tablet to learn the next part of the pass phrase."
"115740052-0-44864";"The intruders the Magus warned us about! Stop them!"
"115740052-0-44865";"Where was the Magus going in such a hurry?"
"115740052-0-44866";"Ah, adventurer. Come over here, if you please."
"115740052-0-44868";"She's not lying. He broke my heart! Listen to the young woman."
"115740052-0-44869";"Oof, you're giving me a headache. And what's this, more of you? This is not how I figured today would go."
"115740052-0-44870";"Let's talk to Goldleaf. See what he knows."
"115740052-0-44873";"I won't allow you to escape!"
"115740052-0-44874";"Strike, sacred ones! Freeze their blood!"
"115740052-0-44875";"Brigand! Unhand me!"
"115740052-0-44876";"You three stay here. We'll handle this."
"115740052-0-44877";"This looks like trouble. We're out of here, Lindres."
"115740052-0-44878";"Wait, Folmort … gah! Look at what you two did. Screwed up a great business opportunity!"
"115740052-0-44880";"Okay I give, I give. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you!"
"115740052-0-44881";"Hello you fetching fetcher. You cost me my job."
"115740052-0-44882";"Wait. What friends?"
"115740052-0-44883";"I feel we've come up with punishment that fit his crimes. And we'd like you to choose. Please and thank you."
"115740052-0-44884";"Strike deep, sacred ones!"
"115740052-0-44885";"This won't hurt a bit, Kiv."
"115740052-0-44886";"Kiv, I am taking you on a journey. Time spent in contemplation and service among the Brothers of the Bond will make you … a better person."
"115740052-0-44887";"Get away, you witch!"
"115740052-0-44888";"Hey wait, no. I'm not going to any monastery."
"115740052-0-44889";"Damn. Thought it would be a skeever. Gotta remember for next time, go easy on the spidersilk."
"115740052-0-44890";"Aww, nighty-night, Kiv."
"115740052-0-44891";"Thank you, Galedra. By the time that wears off, we'll be halfway to the monastery."
"115740052-0-44892";"Every part of the story points in a direction. But only the proper order of events provides illumination."
"115740052-0-44893";"My parents live in a townhouse near the port in Gonfalon Bay, back on High Isle. I'd love for them to meet you."
"115740052-0-44894";"No! Not my tools! Dig somewhere else!"
"115740052-0-44895";"My big brother the famous sea captain wins again. How typical!"
"115740052-0-44896";"She's changed the rules. We must speak."
"115740052-0-44897";"It's been a very long time since I've been here. We hid the key under one of the rugs. Hopefully, it's still there."
"115740052-0-44898";"Found it? Excellent. The secret passage is on the top level of the gardens. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-44899";"Meryline? The Hadolids. They attacked. Your father—"
"115740052-0-44900";"The Overseer … he was forced into the mine during the attack!"
"115740052-0-44901";"Hello mother, hello father. I have some news. A thief stole my old signet ring, and may have caused us some issues. Don't worry, my friend and I are looking into it."
"115740052-0-44902";"Hmm. That would explain some letters we've received."
"115740052-0-44903";"We caught the thief and I have the ring, but I want you to have it. I clearly can't keep it safe."
"115740052-0-44904";"I am sure there's a story here, and I bet it involves Aurelia. But for now I'm just so glad to see you."
"115740052-0-44905";"Welcome! Isobel writes us often, so we feel like we know you already!"
"115740052-0-44906";"She's distracted. Now's your chance. Use the censer!"
"115740052-0-44907";"Of course we'll hold it for you. But you know we trust you."
"115740052-0-44908";"Just let us know if you need any help sorting out where he went, all right? We love you too."
"115740052-0-44909";"Amunara will not be denied!"
"115740052-0-44910";"Thank you, both. I'll feel a lot better if I know you have it. I love you guys."
"115740052-0-44911";"What? How?"
"115740052-0-44912";"How does it feel, necromancer? You and your dishonorable ways came close, but not close enough."
"115740052-0-44913";"Challenger, it's time for you to prove your worth. Are you ready?"
"115740052-0-44914";"Claim what is yours, champion."
"115740052-0-44915";"Funny how the inn is always the biggest building in these small towns. Maybe we should start there?"
"115740052-0-44916";"Over there, it's him! Captain Marso, we're here!"
"115740052-0-44917";"Follow me, let's get started!"
"115740052-0-44918";"Amunara doesn't need to solve some stupid puzzle to find the shield, challenger."
"115740052-0-44919";"This must be the place. Let's get in there. If they've hurt Marso, I swear to Stendarr …."
"115740052-0-44920";"We have to be close."
"115740052-0-44921";"I am truly glad that both of you are safe. But it's dangerous out here. Move your butts."
"115740052-0-44922";"A fire burns deep beneath High Isle. The druids of old channeled its power … a dangerous temptation."
"115740052-0-44923";"I won't give up though. Some day, I'll ride one of them."
"115740052-0-44924";"The Allwither cannot be stopped!"
"115740052-0-44925";"She's right. Marso … let's go home. Back to High Isle."
"115740052-0-44927";"Ah, absolutely, sweetheart. Let's go home."
"115740052-0-44928";"Izzy, we'll stay at the Ancient Anchor. You and your friend should come see us when you're back in Gonfalon Bay."
"115740052-0-44929";"My plan is just as plausible as yours! Why won't you just trust me on this?"
"115740052-0-44930";"Innocence means nothing. You couldn't make it off this island if you were Mauloch himself!"
"115740052-0-44933";"Dreadsail Reef is just a short swim off the starboard side. Through the mist. Good hunting, marines."
"115740052-0-44934";"Shame I can't host you longer, but I've got some fool sailors to drown."
"115740052-0-44935";"And they've dumped some uninvited guests overboard. Feel free to gut them on your way out."
"115740052-0-44936";"Ah, here is the secret passage. Enter, challenger. I'll see you at the third trial."
"115740052-0-44937";"Release Amunara! This one must have that shield!"
"115740052-0-44938";"You will regret this. This one swears it."
"115740052-0-44939";"I recognize this spot. Shipwreck Shoals. I think that's where the old man said the Scourge ran aground."
"115740052-0-44940";"They must have buried the loot nearby. Take the map to Shipwreck Shoals and see if you can find the spot."
"115740052-0-44941";"Let's piece it together and see what we've got."
"115740052-0-44942";"Aurelia! Isobel is here! I'm so glad you came."
"115740052-0-44943";"Indeed I am! It will be a welcome break from mother lecturing me."
"115740052-0-44944";"Aurelia, I am just a room away. Stow your sass."
"115740052-0-44945";"Mother says Isobel has been a good influence. I guess there's something to that."
"115740052-0-44946";"Ha ha! Have at thee!"
"115740052-0-44947";"Agh!"
"115740052-0-44948";"Aurelia, I hope you know we're here for you if you need us again. But I hope our days of coming to your rescue are at an end."
"115740052-0-44949";"Hah, me too. Same to you, Dame Veloise. You two are traveling all over, so you have no excuse not to meet up with us from time to time."
"115740052-0-44950";"Deal. Look after Marso, all right? And Stendarr keep you safe, Aurelia Jourvel."
"115740052-0-44951";"How dare you disturb my palace."
"115740052-0-44952";"Draigh! I am going to bounce this Vetitia across the turf when we find her!"
"115740052-0-44953";"I have arrows enough for the likes of you!"
"115740052-0-44954";"The Ascendant Order shall triumph!"
"115740052-0-44955";"Submit, or you will die!"
"115740052-0-44956";"Weakness must be purged!"
"115740052-0-44957";"Song!"
"115740052-0-44958";"Ember, you have to destroy the wards! Please! Help me!"
"115740052-0-44959";"Pathetic weaklings. Fight!"
"115740052-0-44960";"Do you even know how to fight?"
"115740052-0-44961";"All too easy!"
"115740052-0-44962";"Well, squire, do you know where we're going now? Lead on. I'll follow."
"115740052-0-44963";"We're out! Now let's get to that extraction point Marcelle told you about!"
"115740052-0-44967";"You killed me? I'm better than you!"
"115740052-0-44968";"Oh good. I was getting bored!"
"115740052-0-44969";"How could one so lowly take my life?"
"115740052-0-44970";"To the grave with you!"
"115740052-0-44971";"Bury me with my shield."
"115740052-0-44972";"Put up a good fight, I paid for this."
"115740052-0-44973";"I underestimated you."
"115740052-0-44974";"Agh! Stay back!"
"115740052-0-44975";"Hey! Get away from my bedroll!"
"115740052-0-44976";"Hang on Song! We're coming!"
"115740052-0-44977";"Your blood will water these trees."
"115740052-0-44978";"Roots, reclaim me."
"115740052-0-44979";"Killing you is almost too easy."
"115740052-0-44980";"You ended this one's hunt."
"115740052-0-44981";"Tava, save me. It hurts. Please, it hurts."
"115740052-0-44982";"We heard fighting and could not help ourselves. Is everyone safe?"
"115740052-0-44983";"Ember? Jhaka? You're alive? How are you here?"
"115740052-0-44984";"Don't forget about me, precious."
"115740052-0-44985";"Another wretch wants to leave my game? There's only one way out!"
"115740052-0-44986";"We're all prisoners—in a way. Accept your fate."
"115740052-0-44987";"Well done, few make it this far. But I'll end this game myself!"
"115740052-0-44988";"What've we caught here? The fish who thinks it's good clever for the net."
"115740052-0-44989";"You killed me? On my own ship?"
"115740052-0-44990";"Don't mess with that kindlepitch. I won't put you out if you set yourself ablaze."
"115740052-0-44991";"This one can keep up, do not worry."
"115740052-0-44992";"This one never thought he'd leave this place."
"115740052-0-44993";"Careful, Jhaka. Take it slow."
"115740052-0-44994";"Let us know if you need to stop, Jhaka. Don't push yourself too hard."
"115740052-0-44995";"Through this gate lies the jungle of Amenos. Your home for the rest of your miserable lives."
"115740052-0-44996";"Please, I'm innocent I tell you! Don't send me into the jungle!"
"115740052-0-44997";"Too late for that. You've all been processed. If we don't banish you into the jungle, you'll die."
"115740052-0-44998";"Right. Certain death out here. At least a slight chance to survive in the jungle. That's the fate of the banished."
"115740052-0-44999";"This one knows she can never leave the jungle, but sometimes slipping through that gate is so tempting …."
"115740052-0-45000";"It's too much! I can't hold it!"
"115740052-0-45002";"Right. The essence of the game is to buy cards to add to your play deck. Each of us will use our play deck to score prestige, until one of us gets enough prestige to win."
"115740052-0-45003";"Ha! You made that look easy! Suck eggs, Fabermund!"
"115740052-0-45004";"Yeah! Well played! Well played! You're off to the final round!"
"115740052-0-45005";"Aw, look at that, Sorinne. I think Varnauld's about to cry."
"115740052-0-45006";"Yup. He's definitely welling up. Here comes the waterfall."
"115740052-0-45007";"Shut up! Just … just shut up!"
"115740052-0-45008";"So now, it's my turn. I'll control the table until I signal the end of my turn. See if you can figure out my strategy based on my actions."
"115740052-0-45009";"Well, well! The cards you drew gave you both gold and power. Power has two uses—the first is combat. But it also turns into Prestige at the end of your turn. Remember, earning Prestige is how you win!"
"115740052-0-45010";"Right, it's my turn again. I'm going to draw some Coin, use it to buy a card, and draw some Power from my play deck, which will become Prestige when my turn ends. Just like your turn! Only, uh … more experienced."
"115740052-0-45011";"Those cards you drew can trigger a combo. See how they have extra effects if you draw another card that matches their suit? Luckily, you bought cards with the suit you need to trigger these combos."
"115740052-0-45012";"See these little fellows? They're our patrons. Each deck comes with its own patron, and they play an important role in how the deck works."
"115740052-0-45013";"Halt! I said halt!"
"115740052-0-45014";"I will control your very essence!"
"115740052-0-45015";"My cruelty will course through your veins!"
"115740052-0-45016";"Your blood is MINE to command!"
"115740052-0-45017";"No! The blood should only answer to me…"
"115740052-0-45018";"My brood shall feast on your flesh!"
"115740052-0-45019";"A thousand feathers; a thousand cuts!"
"115740052-0-45020";"My children shall make nests from your bones…"
"115740052-0-45021";"Feel the icy touch of death!"
"115740052-0-45022";"The grave comes for you!"
"115740052-0-45023";"Death comes for us all, in turn…"
"115740052-0-45024";"I will scratch out your eyeballs! Let me down!"
"115740052-0-45025";"Go ahead back to the gaming hall and let Brahgas know I'm coming. This old life … I'm done with it."
"115740052-0-45026";"Ho, there! Are we ready to light it up?"
"115740052-0-45027";"Ha! That's one of Raenobi's lackeys down. One to go!"
"115740052-0-45028";"I told you, Malilen, there's nothing you can drink, sniff, or smoke that can make up for garbage strategies. Tell Raenobi she's next!"
"115740052-0-45029";"I should've asked before—you can handle yourself in a fight, yeah? Eh, I'm sure you can."
"115740052-0-45030";"Those bones! Now we know why they call it Whalefall."
"115740052-0-45031";"Look at that fortress to the north. It's made of ship parts!"
"115740052-0-45032";"All those important hunters must come in from here."
"115740052-0-45033";"Dumac take this. Just try and catch me now you flat-footed fool!"
"115740052-0-45034";"Excellent work! Now, to perform the ritual, stand over there, concentrate on the butterfly and release it toward me!"
"115740052-0-45035";"All right, now just stand over there, concentrate and release the dragonfly to me. Careful!"
"115740052-0-45036";"Well done, my friend! Now, help me perform the ritual!"
"115740052-0-45037";"Watch your step. Those sigils are dangerous."
"115740052-0-45038";"And just like that you are off to Stormhold! I knew you would be victorious, my friend!"
"115740052-0-45039";"Quickly, this way! We're too late. I'll try to contain it!"
"115740052-0-45040";"Don't let those monsters reach the fissure! They'll overload it!"
"115740052-0-45041";"Well done! I'll stabilize the vent while you use the torchbug to seal it!"
"115740052-0-45042";"It looks like the portholes are open. Up the ladder, dear. I'm right behind you."
"115740052-0-45043";"Rise, my children! Rise!"
"115740052-0-45044";"<Baa… baaaa.>"
"115740052-0-45045";"Come into the maze and find me … if you can."
"115740052-0-45046";"Where could I be? Come into the maze and find out."
"115740052-0-45047";"I grow tired of this. You will die in this maze."
"115740052-0-45048";"Welcome to my domain. Careful not to lose yourself."
"115740052-0-45049";"You'll never get out of here alive …."
"115740052-0-45050";"Brace yourself! This shield can absorb the lightning, so long as you hold it!"
"115740052-0-45051";"Good! Now release the energy back at them!"
"115740052-0-45053";"Fool! You cannot withstand the storm!"
"115740052-0-45054";"The attack's already begun—we'll have to fight our way into the castle. Lead the way, dear."
"115740052-0-45055";"Not this way … Langley and Berjo are still chopping away, and I don't want to tip them off."
"115740052-0-45056";"Inside, dear! Jakarn, too. Our captains can hold the dock."
"115740052-0-45057";"Satakal, grant me your shadow!"
"115740052-0-45058";"And we'll take the battlements!"
"115740052-0-45059";"To the courtyard! Friend, join me!"
"115740052-0-45060";"Look there. Something's posted on that wooden pillar."
"115740052-0-45061";"I'll take your fingers! Vengeance for mother's treachery!"
"115740052-0-45062";"Hey! Over here!"
"115740052-0-45063";"That weird light dragged Song into that room! We have to save her! Through that door!"
"115740052-0-45064";"Follow me. The sooner we start, the sooner it's over."
"115740052-0-45065";"The Emerald Eye fears no enemy!"
"115740052-0-45066";"No! You will not best me!"
"115740052-0-45067";"No! The Eye will prevail!"
"115740052-0-45068";"What is she thinking? No one gets off this island."
"115740052-0-45069";"Nice work! I wouldn't have been so merciful, but at least we know more than we did. I'll see you back at the manor."
"115740052-0-45070";"Well done. We got what we need and you're leaving the dockmaster to the fate he deserves. I'll see you back at the manor."
"115740052-0-45071";"Get away from me, stupid thing!"
"115740052-0-45072";"I-is it gone?"
"115740052-0-45073";"Lots of cards, yeah? The ones on your side of the table are yours. The ones on my side are mine. The cards in the middle are what we call ""the tavern."" We each claim cards from the tavern to improve our play decks and earn enough prestige to win."
"115740052-0-45074";"You'll take the first turn. Let's both draw our starting hand."
"115740052-0-45075";"Each of your cards have a coin value. See? You can use their coin value to buy cards into your play deck from the tavern, the center of the table."
"115740052-0-45076";"Try to keep track of the value of the cards in your hand. Each card has a cost, a suit, and an effect."
"115740052-0-45077";"If I were you … well, this card here seems like the right one for you to buy with the coin that you have. So, claim it."
"115740052-0-45078";"When you buy a card, you subtract its cost from your coin total and you get the card. Then, a new card replaces that card in the tavern. You still have enough coin to buy another card, so let's do that."
"115740052-0-45079";"Now, you can't play a card you bought right away. When you buy a card, it goes into a cooldown pile here, see? You can see at a glance what card suits are in your cooldown pile."
"115740052-0-45080";"It looks like you don't have enough coin to buy any other cards, and there's nothing else you can do at the moment. When that happens, you signal that your turn is over."
"115740052-0-45081";"Any resources you have at the end of your turn will be cleared once your turn is over. Except Prestige, that is."
"115740052-0-45082";"Once your turn ends, you discard your cards and draw five new ones. You can start to plan your next turn while I take mine."
"115740052-0-45083";"That said, you should always keep an eye on what your opponent is up to on their turn. They might buy a card or take an action that will force you to revise your plans."
"115740052-0-45084";"Remember when I told you that your currencies get cleared when you end your turn? Well, Power doesn't carry over between turns. But, when you do signal the end of your turn, any Power you have left over turns into Prestige. Good to know, eh?"
"115740052-0-45085";"All right, you need to draw new cards, but your deck is empty. Now, we shuffle your cooldown pile, and that becomes your new draw pile. You might draw cards you bought last turn, as well as those you started with."
"115740052-0-45086";"Your cooldown pile is empty. That means all the cards you started with, or bought during play, are now in your draw pile."
"115740052-0-45087";"Some of the most powerful effects on cards come from combos—and a card will tell you how much of each suit you need to activate its combo effect. Great players always try to trigger combos, so keep track of those suits!"
"115740052-0-45088";"We're closing in on the end! I can tell by keeping track of the Prestige we've earned. For this practice match, we're keeping the total small. But in a real game, you'll need more Prestige to win."
"115740052-0-45089";"See, each patron has something they want—a price, let's call it. They also have something to offer—a reward. Pay a patron's price, and you'll get their reward. You have to pay the price all at once, and you usually get the reward immediately."
"115740052-0-45090";"Try paying one of these patrons. Whichever one you choose to pay will offer you a boon. Just keep in mind, you're only allowed to pay one patron per turn. They can get a little jealous!"
"115740052-0-45091";"The patron you just paid—notice anything different about them? They favor you, now. All patrons start in a neutral bent, and then show favor to whoever pays them first."
"115740052-0-45092";"Of course, you can pay a patron that favors your opponent. If you do, that patron will become neutral. Pay them again on a later turn, and then they'll favor you!"
"115740052-0-45093";"And here's a tip: if you ever can get all Patrons on the table to favor you, you'll win the game—even if you have less Prestige than your opponent! Just one more thing to keep an eye on."
"115740052-0-45095";"I'm ready, friend! Point out a target!"
"115740052-0-45097";"Ignore the livestock, er … people for now! I'll explain later."
"115740052-0-45099";"No. I am … someone else …."
"115740052-0-45100";"Wait, I'm coming with you!"
"115740052-0-45101";"Ah yes, the Thrassian Plague. Terrible disease, simply terrible. I was lucky. So many others … not so much."
"115740052-0-45102";"Ah, the old lighthouse! I remember it well."
"115740052-0-45105";"Perfect. That'll do nicely."
"115740052-0-45109";"I see three confinement wards, those must be the ones Song wants us to destroy!"
"115740052-0-45111";"Ziss'vo! Kishka brought you here to help proffer Tribute challenges, little brother, not sit around mewling about lost biscuits!"
"115740052-0-45112";"They were muffins, sister! And they were very expensive!"
"115740052-0-45116";"Our strike will catch them off guard. You assault one ritual site, and I will handle the other. I shall find you when this grim work is finished."
"115740052-0-45118";"It seems we both met with some tragedy. Come, let's talk."
"115740052-0-45123";"You're a fool to cross the Emerald Eye!"
"115740052-0-45124";"Silverslip? Ha, I knew you'd follow us."
"115740052-0-45125";"Jhaka and I will be close by."
"115740052-0-45126";"Friends! Did you find anything?"
"115740052-0-45127";"Ah, I was wondering when we'd see you, big guy."
"115740052-0-45128";"Silverslip will be along soon. We will follow you to this Necropolis place. Be careful, both of you."
"115740052-0-45130";"We are hurt. Make it stop. Stop!"
"115740052-0-45132";"How? Your current is stronger than mine? I must have it!"
"115740052-0-45134";"Find me at my camp when you're finished, hunter. Good luck."
"115740052-0-45136";"I'll be back."
"115740052-0-45137";"I'll be back."
"115740052-0-45142";"For … the Ascendant Order …."
"115740052-0-45143";"Die!"
"115740052-0-45144";"For the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-45145";"I will not fail the Order!"
"115740052-0-45146";"You will fall!"
"115740052-0-45147";"Face me!"
"115740052-0-45148";"For the Ascendant Magus!"
"115740052-0-45149";"I will gut you!"
"115740052-0-45150";"Bow to the Ascendant Order!"
"115740052-0-45151";"Now, let us return to the inn and settle this bill!"
"115740052-0-45152";"They captured one of the nobles! You, bring that prisoner inside at once!"
"115740052-0-45153";"Sentry! Unlock the gate!"
"115740052-0-45154";"The Marcotts will rise … again!"
"115740052-0-45155";"I can see the ocean! That's a good place to use your signal!"
"115740052-0-45156";"An aura of death precedes you. I can only assume your hunt went well."
"115740052-0-45157";"Divines save us! Look at that thing."
"115740052-0-45158";"Inside, prisoner. Move!"
"115740052-0-45159";"Follow the rules and you won't lose your status as a trusty."
"115740052-0-45160";"Rules? Following the rules got me tossed in the stockade in the first place! But I hear you."
"115740052-0-45161";"You need to learn how to stay on the good side of the jailers. You don't want to get processed and banished to the jungle."
"115740052-0-45162";"Certainly not! I heard that if you get processed and banished, you can never leave the jungle or you die! It's some kind of alchemy or magic or something."
"115740052-0-45163";"On your feet lad. And friend, give him his axe."
"115740052-0-45164";"I'll get Ayrenn and Caska. We'll wait for your signal."
"115740052-0-45165";"Are you a political prisoner, a war criminal, or a murderer? Oh, I know! You're the second cousin of a duke sent here to rot!"
"115740052-0-45166";"Why do I even talk to you?"
"115740052-0-45167";"Disturb not my rest foul creatures!"
"115740052-0-45168";"The Bloodmage is dead!"
"115740052-0-45169";"My power is as eternal as this tower. Your life ends now, wretch!"
"115740052-0-45171";"Ahh, nice to be back in the city! Lady Arabelle wants you back at Mandrake Manor, friend. I'll see you there."
"115740052-0-45172";"Look at this place. Cassel must be close. Let's find Dame Madach, traveler."
"115740052-0-45173";"<Sheep bleat>"
"115740052-0-45174";"Walker. Lady Arabelle wants to see you in the courtyard out back."
"115740052-0-45175";"<Cynric shouts in surprise as he's rapidly yanked through a wall by magic>"
"115740052-0-45176";"It's a matter of honor!"
"115740052-0-45177";"Unbelievable. I guessed it was something like that, but still …. Let's talk, adventurer."
"115740052-0-45178";"Saying goodbye is never easy. But I am certain that … your crew will understand."
"115740052-0-45180";"Friend, Lady Arabelle is waiting for you upstairs."
"115740052-0-45181";"What's it doing?"
"115740052-0-45182";"Keep the corruption going."
"115740052-0-45183";"Look, up there!"
"115740052-0-45184";"We'll kill anyone who gets between us and our prize. That's your last warning, Laurel."
"115740052-0-45185";"We invited you in. We welcomed you!"
"115740052-0-45186";"The seed, we can't let him take it!"
"115740052-0-45187";"It's about time! Talk to me, friend."
"115740052-0-45188";"Well met, friend. Is there news?"
"115740052-0-45189";"I was wondering when you were going to show up again."
"115740052-0-45190";"Our friend has performed above the call of duty! I name them Champion of the Covenant!"
"115740052-0-45191";"Oh very well."
"115740052-0-45192";"I suppose we shall. We did endure much to get to this point, after all."
"115740052-0-45193";"Not so fast, Emeric. I name them Champion of the Dominion!"
"115740052-0-45194";"I can live with that."
"115740052-0-45195";"Well, gentlemen, shall we?"
"115740052-0-45196";"Then let us see how possible peace may be."
"115740052-0-45197";"Then I name them Champion of the Pact!"
"115740052-0-45198";"If you insist."
"115740052-0-45199";"I suddenly feel extremely … humble."
"115740052-0-45200";"Your majesties, please! All of that would never fit on the medal."
"115740052-0-45201";"Let's just agree on Champion of the Alliances, shall we?"
"115740052-0-45202";"Are we ready to begin, your majesties?"
"115740052-0-45203";"The Dais of Stonesight! It's wrong, like a gale offshore."
"115740052-0-45204";"Corruption? Stop this! Firesong, what are you doing?"
"115740052-0-45205";"This poor stone spirit. I hope I can cleanse it of Archdruid Devyric's filthy magic."
"115740052-0-45207";"<Stinger>"
"115740052-0-45208";"Archdruid Devyric went down to the Deeproot. Follow him while I take care of this corruption."
"115740052-0-45209";"Archdruid Devyric, stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-45210";"Laurel, you know where the seed is, don't you? Come with me."
"115740052-0-45211";"Look down, Laurel. Do you see your rescue?"
"115740052-0-45212";"I don't. All I see is myself squashing your hope beneath my boot."
"115740052-0-45213";"Still down there? Why won't you give up?"
"115740052-0-45214";"I was personally sent by my leader. I will not fail her."
"115740052-0-45215";"He's killing the spirit. He has the seed. Stop him. Please stop him!"
"115740052-0-45216";"I have the Air's sight. I have the seed. You failed and all that's left to do is die!"
"115740052-0-45217";"Best the foes awaiting you and unlock the door to pass."
"115740052-0-45218";"Come through. No need to fear Lutea."
"115740052-0-45219";"I'm free? I'm free! I'm … hungry."
"115740052-0-45220";"Root rot and waste! Archdruid Devyric raised a barrier. We can't get through."
"115740052-0-45221";"Oh, was that left there for you? The cooks here sell slaughterfish stew to mainlanders and tell them it's some fancy gumbo."
"115740052-0-45222";"Specialty of the house! Rubbed in garlic and pepper, then seared over a volcanic vent. Only way to eat ornaug, really. They're inedible otherwise."
"115740052-0-45223";"Did you like those fish biscuits? They're mostly salt and fish meal. Sailors take them to sea because they last forever. And they have a nice crunch."
"115740052-0-45224";"Here, get behind this stone shield!"
"115740052-0-45225";"This spell is too strong to break on my own. Destroy the nearby trellis sentinels!"
"115740052-0-45226";"I'm sure there's some way to fix the sentinels. Hurry, bring down the next one."
"115740052-0-45227";"All that fuss over rotten fish and a few coins …."
"115740052-0-45228";"Not the most complex of mysteries, it would seem."
"115740052-0-45229";"It's down! Archdruid Devyric, stop right where you are!"
"115740052-0-45230";"We have to cleanse the Spirit of Root. Find Laurel!"
"115740052-0-45231";"I think you should move along, stranger. This fishing hole's closed."
"115740052-0-45232";"If I just knew this land better, I'd go find him myself! Blighted Firesong!"
"115740052-0-45233";"He was a blight and a thorn, but still. May the dirt take Archdruid Devyric into its embrace."
"115740052-0-45234";"What a mess. Didn't expect gadabouts from the mainland to put up such a fight."
"115740052-0-45235";"Over here. Dhulef should be somewhere inside."
"115740052-0-45237";"Dhulef! Y'ffre's grace, the Firesong didn't get you!"
"115740052-0-45238";"You know better than to worry about me, Laurel. But look, I found something."
"115740052-0-45239";"Fill in our friend, I'll keep watch back here."
"115740052-0-45240";"We'll meet you at the camp shortly, friend. I want to take a look at this tablet first."
"115740052-0-45241";"Another druid! Are you with them? Stay back!"
"115740052-0-45242";"Thanks for the gold. And be grateful I'm letting you live."
"115740052-0-45243";"What happened here?"
"115740052-0-45244";"Druids … called themselves the Firesong. They attacked us!"
"115740052-0-45245";"Blight and thorns! Please, friend, talk to her and find out what happened."
"115740052-0-45246";"Firesong camps, on the mainland? We need to figure out where they took Wyress Tola."
"115740052-0-45247";"You're back! What of Wyress Tola?"
"115740052-0-45248";"There's a cave near that spot on the map, over on the eastern shore. We never go there. My sisters say it's haunted."
"115740052-0-45249";"Haunted? Great. I'll bet that's it then. We'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-45250";"Clear a path ahead, friend. We'll follow behind you."
"115740052-0-45251";"The ritual is nearly complete. The spirit will be ours soon enough."
"115740052-0-45254";"Bah! I don't have time for distractions. The second ritual site awaits."
"115740052-0-45255";"Wyress Tola, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-45256";"Ah, Dhulef. You and your friends arrived just in time. Thank you."
"115740052-0-45257";"The Glenmoril Wyrd, hmm? Let's discuss our next steps."
"115740052-0-45258";"Much obliged, Wyress Tola. Clear skies to you."
"115740052-0-45259";"Stay back, druid. Your threats of violence are not welcome here."
"115740052-0-45260";"I wonder what this button does …."
"115740052-0-45261";"Please, I'm not one of the others you encountered. My friends and I are here to stop them."
"115740052-0-45262";"Oh, really. And why should I trust you?"
"115740052-0-45263";"Thank you, wyress. We'll find Wyress Sorcha and stop the Firesong. I promise."
"115740052-0-45264";"Too late, fools! I claim the ancient spirit for the Firesong, just as the prophecy dictates!"
"115740052-0-45265";"Bright. Awake. The flesh fades."
"115740052-0-45266";"The spirit! Can … can they understand us?"
"115740052-0-45267";"Loud … ugh, too loud. Writhing."
"115740052-0-45268";"Zeht's tears! Friend, maybe you could talk to the spirit? They seem … confused."
"115740052-0-45269";"Let's see who reaches the clifftop first!"
"115740052-0-45270";"Frii, I'm a druid. I'll take you someplace safe after I talk to my friend."
"115740052-0-45271";"Like the Druid King? Sunlight on leaves. Yes, Frii will go with you."
"115740052-0-45272";"We could bring Frii to the Mages Guild. I'm sure they'd be safe there, Laurel."
"115740052-0-45273";"No, Dhulef. I think I need to take Frii to the Stonelore Circle. They belong with the druids."
"115740052-0-45274";"Frii belongs with druids, yes, yes. Purpose and stone, rain and sun."
"115740052-0-45275";"Hey there. Get you something?"
"115740052-0-45276";"Here we go! One Y'ffelon Surprise! Enjoy, you two!"
"115740052-0-45277";"Hadolids! Well, come on then you clacking beasts!"
"115740052-0-45278";"Ho, wayfarer! Still alive? I've almost reached the top."
"115740052-0-45279";"Look at the jaws on you, creature!"
"115740052-0-45280";"By my father's head! Dwarven construction!"
"115740052-0-45281";"I'll join you presently. After I handle some Hadolid bullies."
"115740052-0-45282";"I can feel salt in my veins once more! Let's open that hatch."
"115740052-0-45283";"Ho there, Tamsfolk. Pay a coin for a tune?"
"115740052-0-45284";"One original song, coming right up!"
"115740052-0-45287";"Argh! What in Oblivion?"
"115740052-0-45288";"Beef-wit! Knock off that racket!"
"115740052-0-45289";"I say, you fobbing rascals! Bilge-breath jackanapes! I've five coins that say you're too soft to prove your mettle. Let us engage in fisticuffs!"
"115740052-0-45290";"Five coin sounds good. Hah!"
"115740052-0-45292";"Kynareth's reeking bilge, what is that smell?"
"115740052-0-45293";"Spirit! Stop. Please stop!"
"115740052-0-45294";"Damn it, where did that cat skulk off to? I told you to keep an eye on him!"
"115740052-0-45295";"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were there, too. What should we tell the boss?"
"115740052-0-45296";"We've got to report in. But let's shake loose a few payments first. Maybe he'll go easier on us."
"115740052-0-45297";"You received my letter then? Thanks for coming."
"115740052-0-45298";"More and more curious. Swampier than I expected."
"115740052-0-45299";"Look here on the desk. Scattered papers. Strange."
"115740052-0-45300";"Hmm. Not Dwarven. Scout ahead, if you will. I'll catch up."
"115740052-0-45301";"I found something! A map that shows the way to the station's core."
"115740052-0-45302";"Ah, soggy bullocks. The door we want is blocked."
"115740052-0-45303";"Look here. The wall's breached. Let's see where it goes."
"115740052-0-45304";"Flooding wore away this tunnel. The sea always wins."
"115740052-0-45305";"I think I hear the station again."
"115740052-0-45306";"Excellent, another breach. We're back in."
"115740052-0-45307";"Fine work! It looked fun. Now, we go … north."
"115740052-0-45308";"Deeper down we go! Get on the platform."
"115740052-0-45309";"Pull the lever when you're ready."
"115740052-0-45310";"Been a great while since I took a splash like that!"
"115740052-0-45311";"Tava bless me. Look at the sea floor."
"115740052-0-45312";"All right. Let's get to the station's center."
"115740052-0-45313";"The central core is right behind—bah, blocked again."
"115740052-0-45314";"Go through this portal, then walk to the central room. Don't concern yourself about air."
"115740052-0-45315";"Oof! What a fight. I'd say we found the undead's source."
"115740052-0-45317";"Do not feel bold too quickly!"
"115740052-0-45318";"Hurry, mortal. Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-45319";"Are you tired? These machines shall give you no rest!"
"115740052-0-45320";"Yes! What savagery in your rich souls."
"115740052-0-45321";"Look, a body. Holding … a logbook."
"115740052-0-45322";"I hope that fissure calms down. Let's go."
"115740052-0-45323";"Sacred seeds? Laurel said the Firesong were after the Stonelore seed at Earthen Root Enclave. What does this have to do with the Druid King's visit to the wyrd?"
"115740052-0-45324";"Do you have a moment, dear? There's something I'd like to discuss."
"115740052-0-45325";"That's the crystal. Oh. The fissure grew. Ugh, let's talk."
"115740052-0-45326";"I saw the first crystal to the southeast."
"115740052-0-45327";"Most of the crystals are shattered. Should be one small one left."
"115740052-0-45328";"The last crystal is larger than the others. We need to find it."
"115740052-0-45329";"Well done! Let's get out of here so we can conclude our business arrangement."
"115740052-0-45330";"Hag Fen, huh? That's enough to point us in a direction, at least."
"115740052-0-45331";"What's that inscribed there? Frii? Wonder what that means."
"115740052-0-45332";"Do you think the crystal split that rock? Let's find another one."
"115740052-0-45333";"Such good smashing! But there's more."
"115740052-0-45334";"What a satisfying crack. Let's keep searching."
"115740052-0-45335";"Five-claw! Za'ji has news!"
"115740052-0-45337";"All right. Time to tell the boss we lost the cat."
"115740052-0-45338";"Hmm. Could this be the same group? No way these thugs stopped an Eye of the Queen."
"115740052-0-45339";"These two are criminals, not pirates. Their boss must be working with Redblade, then."
"115740052-0-45340";"Raz begins to see the pieces fall into place. But let's confirm his suspicions …."
"115740052-0-45341";"Let's get back to Druid Laurel and Wyress Joslin and show them what we found."
"115740052-0-45342";"Stay here, Laurel. I'll follow our friend but stay out of their way. Let's go see what the Firesong are up to."
"115740052-0-45343";"An ancient device. What threat could it pose?"
"115740052-0-45344";"How dare you disturb a sacred spirit of nature!"
"115740052-0-45345";"Careful, wyress. The spirit will belong to the Firesong. The prophecy decrees it!"
"115740052-0-45346";"Down there! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-45347";"Incredible. It's all so vibrant. How could I have known?"
"115740052-0-45348";"Go on ahead, mate. I'll join you presently."
"115740052-0-45349";"Welcome back, dear. And wipe that expression off your face. I'm not dead yet."
"115740052-0-45350";"Lady Arabelle, you need to rest."
"115740052-0-45351";"Any distinctive markings on the bottle, dear?"
"115740052-0-45352";"Aside from the anonymous signature, it's the same as other notes I've received."
"115740052-0-45353";"You must be my eyes and ears on this, dear. Tell me what you discovered."
"115740052-0-45356";"Ah, friend, look! It appears something heavy was dragged up and down this hill recently."
"115740052-0-45357";"A door! That's definitely where whatever made the marks came from."
"115740052-0-45358";"Those must be the crates the courier delivered. Check the labels."
"115740052-0-45359";"Those were intended for Steadfast Manor. Why deliver them here? See what's inside the open one."
"115740052-0-45360";"Society of the Steadfast armor! With that, the Ascendant Order could impersonate Steadfast knights."
"115740052-0-45361";"The Ascendant Lord is recruiting disillusioned druids after the events on Galen? Insidious!"
"115740052-0-45362";"That's what I was looking for! A Systres cavebloom. But I've never seen one with quite that color before. I'll take a sample."
"115740052-0-45363";"With these, I should be able to craft an antidote. What did you find over there?"
"115740052-0-45364";"The Steadfast are here to aid those harmed by the Sea Elf attacks. I have no knights to lend you, Count Mornard, Sir Stefan."
"115740052-0-45365";"We'll have to handle the Sea Elves ourselves, then. I don't know what's keeping the druids."
"115740052-0-45366";"Archdruid Orlaith! What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-45367";"Confirming a suspicion, little Laurel."
"115740052-0-45368";"Archdruid Rahval was right to call the Draoife together. Tell him the Firesong will attend."
"115740052-0-45369";"The time has come to gather the seeds. The prophecy of the Druid King is at hand."
"115740052-0-45370";"The seeds? Is that what this—oh, blight! She's gone. Friend, we should talk."
"115740052-0-45372";"Hmm. That empty sconce. See the druid symbols carved into it? Check if the shard fits into the socket."
"115740052-0-45373";"Just as I suspected, a hidden door! Let's see what other secrets this manor is hiding."
"115740052-0-45374";"A passage leading deeper beneath the manor. Let's see what Lord Bacaro is hiding down here."
"115740052-0-45375";"No! We were too late. Archdruid Michiel killed Wyress Sorcha. We need to get inside and stop him, now."
"115740052-0-45376";"Those carvings! Definitely druidic."
"115740052-0-45379";"Five-claw! Za'ji brings an urgent message."
"115740052-0-45380";"Friend, what news of Vastyr? Why are the spirits of the island in such distress?"
"115740052-0-45381";"Over here, mate!"
"115740052-0-45382";"Nice work, mate! Your aim was impeccable."
"115740052-0-45383";"The candles are still burning. The Eldertide Druids who tend this altar have not been gone for long."
"115740052-0-45384";"Emberblooms? The Firesong use them to cast certain spells. Are they involved in this, too?"
"115740052-0-45386";"A lorekeeper? What relic could they be searching for?"
"115740052-0-45387";"Let's take a look in the lodge. There might be something about the relic there."
"115740052-0-45388";"Well done, five-claw. Let's hunker down and see what we can see."
"115740052-0-45389";"Are we going to discuss how your thugs lost track of the cat? I may need to cut you out, Grandvache. In more ways than one."
"115740052-0-45390";"Where are you, you damnable pirate? We need to talk."
"115740052-0-45391";"A single Sea Elf bested the lot of you?"
"115740052-0-45392";"She hit us like a storm of steel. Didn't kill anyone, though. Just put us in the sand."
"115740052-0-45393";"Redblade! Let's get in there!"
"115740052-0-45394";"What? Roneiia?"
"115740052-0-45395";"Damned cat!"
"115740052-0-45396";"Lady Arabelle, drink this. It will neutralize the poison."
"115740052-0-45397";"We discovered the source of the poison and … something more. Our friend will tell you."
"115740052-0-45398";"Intruders! Guards, to me!"
"115740052-0-45399";"I knew you wouldn't let me down. Tell me what you uncovered, dear."
"115740052-0-45400";"This one will grab some documents. Make tracks, five-claw!"
"115740052-0-45401";"This one has the information I seek. We simply need to extract it from her."
"115740052-0-45402";"I'll take her with me to the keep. Dispose of the rest as you wish, but do not tarry long."
"115740052-0-45403";"No! Please! Don't hurt them. You only need me!"
"115740052-0-45404";"Aye, sealord. We'll clean up here. After a bit of … fun."
"115740052-0-45405";"Captain Siravaen? Why are you—urk!"
"115740052-0-45406";"Slug! You and your sealord aren't fit to call yourselves Maormer!"
"115740052-0-45407";"Stay your hand, stranger! This Sea Elf saved our lives."
"115740052-0-45408";"I told the fool knights outside I wasn't their enemy. Do you have more sense than them?"
"115740052-0-45409";"Seems the crime boss has connections all around the region. Raz will pass this along when we're done here."
"115740052-0-45410";"Raz thinks Yves regrets going into business with Redblade."
"115740052-0-45411";"Hold your paws. Based on this, Redblade is at a dig site on the coast. Somewhere near Fauns' Thicket."
"115740052-0-45412";"Back into the fray, then. Raz will meet you at Fauns' Thicket, five-claw."
"115740052-0-45413";"Ah, here's our mate now."
"115740052-0-45414";"There you are. Laurel, may I escort you to the Draoife?"
"115740052-0-45415";"My thanks, Stefan. I have much to tell you. But I promised to show our friend here the Telling Stone along the way."
"115740052-0-45416";"Of course. We'll see you at the Telling Stone, friend."
"115740052-0-45417";"Thank you, mainlander. Now go help Laurel and Stefan!"
"115740052-0-45418";"Teach these sea-snakes a lesson, mate! I'll keep Rahval and Ellic safe."
"115740052-0-45419";"Orlaith killed most of the Draoife! She's getting away!"
"115740052-0-45420";"Laurel, wait! Damn. I'll go after her. Friend, protect the remaining archdruids!"
"115740052-0-45421";"Go on! I'll keep watch here."
"115740052-0-45422";"Flee, Laurel! Save yourself!"
"115740052-0-45423";"Stefan!"
"115740052-0-45424";"Mainlanders should not meddle in druid affairs. Deal with them, Branagh!"
"115740052-0-45425";"You defeated my champion? No matter."
"115740052-0-45426";"Tell Count Mornard to stay out of this or his son's life is forfeit!"
"115740052-0-45427";"The Eldertide will make Orlaith answer for this outrage!"
"115740052-0-45428";"She has young Stefan. We must tread carefully. Yet thanks to this mainlander, we still live."
"115740052-0-45429";"We must inform Count Mornard. I won't tell archdruids what to do, but you're welcome in Vastyr."
"115740052-0-45430";"The day is upon us. The Draoife must crown a new Druid King!"
"115740052-0-45431";"Perhaps, but you have no right to claim the sacred seeds by force."
"115740052-0-45432";"You hide your seeds and keep the Sower of Kasorayn's Dream for yourself. You declared this war, not the Firesong."
"115740052-0-45433";"No Druid King can be crowned until the circles are united! The Telling Stone is quite clear …."
"115740052-0-45434";"This Draoife is a sham! If I must burn away the old to reveal the new, so be it!"
"115740052-0-45435";"And now my son is in their clutches? We should have left these foolish druids to their squabbles."
"115740052-0-45436";"Ignoring someone doesn't mean they'll ignore you. We need the Eldertide and the Stonelore to meet this threat. And save your son."
"115740052-0-45437";"The mercenary returns? Dhulef speaks highly of you. Come, then. I would hear your account of what transpired."
"115740052-0-45438";"Glad you made it, five-claw. Raz thinks we should split up. The letters mentioned water, so … let's head for the far side of the thicket. See you there."
"115740052-0-45439";"This must be it! Let's get inside."
"115740052-0-45440";"Roneiia must be here somewhere. And likely, she's not alone. Time to put on our serious faces, my friend."
"115740052-0-45441";"Search the castle. If there are more rogue knights, I want them in chains!"
"115740052-0-45442";"Raz will place the charges this way. You follow the path and place the others. Good luck, five-claw."
"115740052-0-45443";"The Eyes mean nothing to me now. The Bequest belongs to Captain Redblade!"
"115740052-0-45444";"Damn you, cat …."
"115740052-0-45445";"There you are! Move your paws and let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-45446";"The library is this way!"
"115740052-0-45448";"No, the case is empty! But how did they know to search the library, let alone behind the shelves?"
"115740052-0-45449";"Octin, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. It's just … I'm scared."
"115740052-0-45450";"Don't worry, Joslin. I literally forgot all about it until you just mentioned it."
"115740052-0-45451";"Old secrets, left behind. Play with them, if you wish."
"115740052-0-45452";"You seem drawn to these secrets. Like a fish, enticed by bait."
"115740052-0-45453";"You're swimming into danger once again, little fish."
"115740052-0-45454";"Impressive. But other secrets await. How long until one cuts you down?"
"115740052-0-45455";"Ah, the little fish avoids the hook. For now."
"115740052-0-45456";"For untold centuries, I've watched lesser creatures die from those devices. What clever little fish!"
"115740052-0-45457";"I'm turning into a tree. A tree, Octin!"
"115740052-0-45458";"At least your bark is beautiful. I got turned into a floaty orb thing!"
"115740052-0-45459";"Stay up here, Laurel. This spirit will tell me what I want to know."
"115740052-0-45460";"Think you'll find the seed? Your ego is blinding."
"115740052-0-45461";"Blinding? The seed is here. Well, there's no reason to keep you or the spirit now."
"115740052-0-45462";"Awaken, construct! Reward the clever mortal."
"115740052-0-45463";"The Sea Elf escaped? Too bad. At least we can get these druids to safety."
"115740052-0-45464";"We'll handle things from here. Return to Vastyr and report to Sir Stefan when you're ready."
"115740052-0-45465";"Over here! Just getting a charcoal rubbing of this tablet."
"115740052-0-45466";"No sign of Wyress Tola, but what's that?"
"115740052-0-45467";"There's something over there."
"115740052-0-45468";"Let's see if we can find any sign of Wyress Tola."
"115740052-0-45469";"Over there! That's one of Lady Arabelle's companions!"
"115740052-0-45470";"All these plants were recently torn away. This door must have been hidden for ages."
"115740052-0-45471";"That's Lady Arabelle! What's she doing?"
"115740052-0-45472";"Careful, dears, and watch where you step."
"115740052-0-45473";"Don't move, Lady Arabelle. Let me see what I can do."
"115740052-0-45474";"Not a muscle, dear lady. Go, my friend. Find Bacaro and Frii!"
"115740052-0-45475";"Obey your king! Destroy the Stonelore Circle and their allies!"
"115740052-0-45477";"The reign of the Druid King begins here. Kill the intruders!"
"115740052-0-45479";"Roots untangle, bindings shrivel …."
"115740052-0-45480";"Wake and obey, the Firesong command you …."
"115740052-0-45481";"You dare command an archdruid, wyress? I have no further need of you. Time to die!"
"115740052-0-45482";"music"
"115740052-0-45483";"Perhaps I can help. Let me create a portal to Bangkorai. It should deposit you close to the wyrd camp."
"115740052-0-45484";"Friend, help me release the spirit!"
"115740052-0-45485";"The ritual is complete. The spirit, it stirs."
"115740052-0-45486";"No, you cannot summon the spirit! It's not time!"
"115740052-0-45487";"Soon, the power of this ancient spirit will belong to the Firesong!"
"115740052-0-45488";"Tu'whacca watch over us. Stay on guard."
"115740052-0-45489";"Let me open a portal for us back to the camp. Here we are."
"115740052-0-45490";"Someone approaches, guard the ritual site!"
"115740052-0-45491";"Well done, sailor! Archdruid Michiel didn't stand a chance against you."
"115740052-0-45492";"Come back here, Bacaro, you coward!"
"115740052-0-45493";"You want to do what? No. Think it through. Flammable tree bark over here!"
"115740052-0-45494";"But this will go faster if we break up the fire shard. More shards mean more heat and—"
"115740052-0-45495";"This adventurer agreed to help us. Does that help solve our problem?"
"115740052-0-45496";"These carvings tell an interesting story. Take a look, my friend."
"115740052-0-45497";"An adventurer, ey? That explains the boots."
"115740052-0-45498";"We meet again, mercenary. I expected as much."
"115740052-0-45499";"This carving shows the Druid King binding a spirit into Mount Firesong."
"115740052-0-45500";"This carving depicts the spirit slumbering within the volcano. See the Druid King's regalia?"
"115740052-0-45501";"This carving indicates a possible future. See how the spirit awakens and the volcano erupts? It's a warning."
"115740052-0-45502";"I should send one of my brainless ghouls to solve this for you."
"115740052-0-45503";"Unwise. The constructs react poorly when you remove their energy supply."
"115740052-0-45504";"See? Now you've upset it. Hahahaha!"
"115740052-0-45505";"I always say, when someone gives you a warning, it's best to take heed."
"115740052-0-45506";"If we're going to stop Bacaro, we're going to need help. Go to Castle Mornard and rally Count Stefan's knights. I'll make sure the rest of us are ready."
"115740052-0-45507";"Destroy them, my ursauk!"
"115740052-0-45508";"An outsider? Well, if this is Y'ffre's will. Come here, please."
"115740052-0-45509";"Stop ignoring us, Fenas! We want to help!"
"115740052-0-45510";"What are we doing out here again?"
"115740052-0-45511";"The Dreadsails are here! Orlaith has betrayed us!"
"115740052-0-45512";"Quickly, please! Save Octin, too!"
"115740052-0-45513";"Please, you have to save Joslin, too!"
"115740052-0-45514";"Gwenaelle? She's not here! That's some small relief."
"115740052-0-45516";"Druid Senna saw the mote cloud form? It's like nothing I've encountered."
"115740052-0-45517";"Friend, over here! You're a welcome sight!"
"115740052-0-45518";"You return. And with the key, I hope!"
"115740052-0-45519";"Thank you. Now let us speak without the bars between us."
"115740052-0-45520";"Niraya! I'll cut you free. Hold on."
"115740052-0-45521";"The seed. They're after the Eldertide seed."
"115740052-0-45522";"I'll stay with Niraya while you clear the way. We'll join you in the courtyard."
"115740052-0-45523";"The door to the shrine is hidden in those roots, mainlander."
"115740052-0-45524";"Captain Uldiss must be inside. Careful, friend. We'll follow as best we can."
"115740052-0-45525";"Take the seed, mainlander. We can avoid the Dreadsails by using the back exit."
"115740052-0-45526";"Take the seed to Vastyr. It will be safe there."
"115740052-0-45527";"Look out! Behind us!"
"115740052-0-45528";"Calm yourself. I am Captain Siravaen of the Gilded Blades. Sealord Nalos escaped me, curse his eyes!"
"115740052-0-45529";"I learned two things you should know. The Firesong also seek the Stonelore relic, and Nalos plans to attack Vastyr soon."
"115740052-0-45530";"I appreciate the warning. Let's continue this outside."
"115740052-0-45531";"I'll be right back. I've never met anyone like you before!"
"115740052-0-45532";"Great. I mean, um, same. Meeting a Sea Elf. Like you, that is."
"115740052-0-45534";"Check where I marked your map. I hope Umindior's safe."
"115740052-0-45535";"It's good to see you, dear! And is that Count Stefan? Glad House Mornard could join us, your excellency."
"115740052-0-45536";"Captain Za'ji's ship is ready to sail. Next stop, Y'ffelon!"
"115740052-0-45537";"Witness the power of a Firesong archdruid!"
"115740052-0-45538";"You and that blighted Stonelore! Why must you interfere?"
"115740052-0-45539";"You can't turn the tide of prophecy …."
"115740052-0-45540";"Is that you, dear? I still need rest."
"115740052-0-45541";"We found some troubling things, outsider."
"115740052-0-45542";"Spirit motes surround that Firesong druid!"
"115740052-0-45543";"Talk to her, outsider. This won't hold her long!"
"115740052-0-45544";"Come, dear, we have plans to make."
"115740052-0-45545";"I hope someone feeds my dog!"
"115740052-0-45546";"These Ascendant Order barnacles are cowards! They flee at the first sign of a worthy opponent."
"115740052-0-45548";"Gah! And now my camp is crushed!"
"115740052-0-45549";"Agh! What the …?"
"115740052-0-45550";"You're not Neri! Who are you?"
"115740052-0-45551";"Defend! Defend!"
"115740052-0-45552";"Blight! Over here, outsider."
"115740052-0-45553";"The cave Laurel suggested, it must be behind those vines."
"115740052-0-45554";"Ah, found my shirt! Oh, now it's wet, too."
"115740052-0-45555";"Tell us how to access the Chronicle. Or this is your fate!"
"115740052-0-45562";"Look, over there! That's Druid Laurel's nature spirit. We have to help them!"
"115740052-0-45563";"Gwenaelle? And the Chronicle? Did you see it, too? The spirit is trying to tell us something."
"115740052-0-45564";"Spirit motes saved Gwenaelle! But why do the Firesong want the Chronicle?"
"115740052-0-45565";"The volcano is becoming more active! The lava is rising!"
"115740052-0-45568";"Y'ffre's bones! What happened to the Chronicle?"
"115740052-0-45575";"I am the Druid King! The birthright is mine! How dare you defy me …."
"115740052-0-45576";"You are not worthy of the regalia, false king."
"115740052-0-45577";"The spirit of Mount Firesong fled when the false king died. The volcano has no spirit to calm it now."
"115740052-0-45578";"Ah! Where did you come from, five-claw? You made Za'ji's heart skip a beat, yes?"
"115740052-0-45579";"The volcano erupted, but except for the top of the mountain, Y'ffelon is intact."
"115740052-0-45580";"I very much want to hear what happened, dear."
"115740052-0-45581";"That's the largest of the crystals I saw. Hit it real hard."
"115740052-0-45582";"The Eldertide druid broke, as I knew she would."
"115740052-0-45583";"Yes, sealord. Are we finished with her?"
"115740052-0-45584";"Keep her alive until we have the relic in hand."
"115740052-0-45585";"Nalos! I've come for your head!"
"115740052-0-45586";"Siravaen? Bah! Uldiss, you get the relic and deliver it to the Firesong. I'll deal with this pest."
"115740052-0-45587";"Die, traitor! For King Orgnum!"
"115740052-0-45588";"The beacon's ready. Do you have the torch?"
"115740052-0-45596";"Hmm … no relic. Could you search for clues? Climbing those rocks winded me."
"115740052-0-45597";"My apologies, poor lass. Ruptga, help us avenge her death!"
"115740052-0-45600";"No, Laurel. Archdruid Orlaith demanded the nature spirit, too. You must find Frii and keep them safe."
"115740052-0-45601";"But Stefan is in danger! I have to—what's that?"
"115740052-0-45602";"Mount Firesong stirs. Archdruid Orlaith and her circle ignore their duties."
"115740052-0-45603";"There it is! Just like the riddle said. Guess that wasn't so hard, was it, Kiko?"
"115740052-0-45605";"Tava's beak! There it is! Nobody would ever think to look there, unless you had a keen mind for bird-brained riddles."
"115740052-0-45606";"You've got the key, so we'll meet you there … unless you want a hint on where to go!"
"115740052-0-45607";"No, stay back!"
"115740052-0-45608";"Those druids, they're transforming into forest wraiths. How is that—"
"115740052-0-45609";"Gwenaelle? No, not you! Please!"
"115740052-0-45610";"Gwen, a forest wraith? No!"
"115740052-0-45611";"Over here! A toast to our success before we conclude our business!"
"115740052-0-45612";"Yes. Yes! Come, descend and drink with me."
"115740052-0-45613";"Just like a fish, to swim into my jaws."
"115740052-0-45614";"Ah, little fish! You have arrived at last."
"115740052-0-45615";"How kind of you to swim right into my open jaws."
"115740052-0-45616";"The lich summons more dead for aid. Exquisite!"
"115740052-0-45617";"I'll provide cover while you dispatch their master!"
"115740052-0-45618";"The spirit motes are thick here, but I have an idea."
"115740052-0-45619";"You did it! I'll clear the vines."
"115740052-0-45620";"More bloated muse-mouths? Use Y'ffre's rain on these as well."
"115740052-0-45621";"I think I owe you, friend. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-45622";"This way. I'll deal with the door."
"115740052-0-45623";"Gwenaelle!"
"115740052-0-45625";"Calm, my dear. These sweet strangers could help."
"115740052-0-45627";"Five-claw! Terrible news! Lady Arabelle has succumbed to some unknown malady! She's upstairs in bed, waiting for you."
"115740052-0-45629";"Gwenaelle! You're back!"
"115740052-0-45630";"Pitof? What happened?"
"115740052-0-45631";"Everything is fine, Gwenaelle. Outsider, come. We owe you so much!"
"115740052-0-45632";"You wish to join my sunken crew? Such lost souls that dare enter my waters."
"115740052-0-45633";"Oh, Y'ffre, let no overcast skies or snaring vines cloud the intention of our thoughts."
"115740052-0-45634";"Storms have mercy, the motes are even thicker now."
"115740052-0-45636";"Seems the druids understood a good time."
"115740052-0-45637";"I wonder what this old carving means."
"115740052-0-45638";"Let's separate. See you back at our camp."
"115740052-0-45639";"Look, on that platform! What's a forest wraith doing here?"
"115740052-0-45640";"Hello! Over here! I'm waving my … oh, crud."
"115740052-0-45641";"It radiates a gentle warmth. Much like yourself."
"115740052-0-45642";"Oh, you're so smart! Tell me again about that druid thing?"
"115740052-0-45643";"You refuse to give us Y'ffre's gift? Very well, we will just kill you and take the Chronicle."
"115740052-0-45644";"Please excuse us, Veshin. I have a request for my friend."
"115740052-0-45645";"We can't just give you the Chronicle. The spirit is bound to this sacred place!"
"115740052-0-45646";"Then we'll cut the Chronicle from the roots and—what's happening?"
"115740052-0-45647";"Spirit motes?"
"115740052-0-45652";"What are you planning, you minx?"
"115740052-0-45653";"Ooh, sea witches can craft magic items? I must know what kind."
"115740052-0-45654";"I'll tell you anything you want, just to stay here with you."
"115740052-0-45655";"I brought one more treat. Abah's Special Cider. Drink up, gorgeous."
"115740052-0-45656";"A toast to … oh, I failed to ask your name. No matter."
"115740052-0-45657";"So potent. I might … oooh …."
"115740052-0-45658";"Head to camp and tell Umindior what we learned. I should make sure Veshin is comfortable."
"115740052-0-45659";"Sleep potion always works wonders. Now, grab his key!"
"115740052-0-45660";"Sealord Nalos plans to attack Vastyr? I guessed as much. Come, let's press on. Time is not on our side."
"115740052-0-45662";"Where's Umindior now?"
"115740052-0-45663";"Umindior. What a buffoon. Let's talk, partner."
"115740052-0-45664";"What's the point of having a partner if they're never around?"
"115740052-0-45665";"At least he left a note. What's it say?"
"115740052-0-45666";"What did they do to you? You look exhausted."
"115740052-0-45667";"I had a quite … rigorous discussion. Very productive."
"115740052-0-45668";"Now you will burn, monsters!"
"115740052-0-45669";"I expected more, mainlander. Once I deal with you, I'll bring the druid her relic!"
"115740052-0-45671";"Well done, hunter. Meet me back at camp when you're ready."
"115740052-0-45672";"Neri brought me here! I, oh, well then."
"115740052-0-45673";"I know so many forms of torture. Starting with kisses."
"115740052-0-45674";"I can't say this is really for me. Wait—ow!"
"115740052-0-45675";"Psst. Over here. Did you get the cloth?"
"115740052-0-45676";"All right, get the key ready. We're almost done."
"115740052-0-45678";"I suppose we should cut the lout free."
"115740052-0-45682";"Firesong coming and going as bold as you please! Orlaith is up to something."
"115740052-0-45683";"We've wasted enough time here. I must return to Y'ffelon."
"115740052-0-45684";"Use every druid we brought here and find the Sower. The seeds must be regrown. I'll sit upon the Ivy Throne when I am crowned king!"
"115740052-0-45685";"The thronehall remains closed, archdruid. The seeds won't open the door."
"115740052-0-45686";"Locked by ancient power, but the stones sing me the key. Find the three druid stones nearby and wake them, Laurel-friend."
"115740052-0-45687";"The stone awakens! The song grows louder!"
"115740052-0-45688";"Good. That stone wakes, too."
"115740052-0-45689";"The stones awake, the door calls to me."
"115740052-0-45690";"Laurel-friend, the door should open for me now."
"115740052-0-45691";"I am the Sower and I remember this elixir. Come talk with me, Laurel-friend."
"115740052-0-45692";"Death bell. A taste lets you dream with your eyes open."
"115740052-0-45693";"Faun's-tongue. A potent ward against evil."
"115740052-0-45694";"Foxglove. A mere pinch weakens the boundary between now and then."
"115740052-0-45695";"Good. Now place the herbs into the cauldron."
"115740052-0-45696";"Now drink. Together we will walk in Elder Aiven's memories."
"115740052-0-45697";"The Ascendant Order is definitely using this place. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-45698";"Hmm, is that a key over there?"
"115740052-0-45702";"Grab Umindior and let's get out of here!"
"115740052-0-45703";"A druid circle! And an ancient one, by the looks of it. I want to get a closer look."
"115740052-0-45709";"She was no Neri. She hurt me. In a bad way. Are we done?"
"115740052-0-45710";"Yes. We did the job. Thanks for all your help."
"115740052-0-45711";"Over here! Let's talk about getting a fire shard."
"115740052-0-45712";"They should be somewhere around here."
"115740052-0-45713";"<Surprised scream>"
"115740052-0-45714";"By Tava's wings! This is it!"
"115740052-0-45715";"He's close. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-45716";"Hunter. This is where the Worm most recently fed. A simple enchantment should lead us to the entrance to his lair."
"115740052-0-45718";"Quite the heist, right Quen? Phew, I'm exhausted."
"115740052-0-45719";"From what? Your antics hardly count as helping."
"115740052-0-45720";"Yes, well, can you blame me? I was entranced."
"115740052-0-45721";"You won't touch this relic. Not until we both deliver it."
"115740052-0-45722";"Come with me. I recently made a new spell. Just for fun, but it could work here."
"115740052-0-45723";"It'd be a lot easier to translate this tablet if I had some quiet."
"115740052-0-45726";"Did all that really happen? The Firesong … the forest wraiths …?"
"115740052-0-45727";"The Chronicle saved you, in its own way."
"115740052-0-45728";"It was angry. That much I remember. The bloodshed, our friends …."
"115740052-0-45729";"We'll grieve for them. And for the Chronicle. We lost a lot this day."
"115740052-0-45730";"The Chronicle is really gone?"
"115740052-0-45731";"Its final act was to release you, dear Gwen."
"115740052-0-45732";"What now, husband?"
"115740052-0-45733";"Now we thank Y'ffre and tell our own stories."
"115740052-0-45734";"Welcome, Sower of the Dream. I am Aiven, apprentice to the Druid King. King Kasorayn bid me prepare for this day. Follow this passage to the Ivy Throne."
"115740052-0-45735";"This stone tablet records Kasorayn's Final Dream. Dark betrayal followed by seeds of hope. We have punished the guilty. Stricken their names. To heal, we forget. But the Sower must remember. Enter the garden."
"115740052-0-45736";"I prepared a cauldron and planted three herbs in this garden. The Sower knows the Elixir of Y'ffre's Thoughts. Mix, drink, and see what I saw the day the Druid King died."
"115740052-0-45737";"Go have fun with that behemoth while I regain our bearings."
"115740052-0-45738";"It's done. Thank you, hunter. I will ensure his remains are scattered. I'll meet you back at camp."
"115740052-0-45741";"Do you see. That's a stylized rendition of the Ivy Throne, with the Druid King's regalia—the crown, staff, and gauntlet—below it. Carved above the throne, that's the heraldry of House Merchad."
"115740052-0-45742";"Begin the ritual at once, Elder Verline. Elder Aiven, I require your assistance."
"115740052-0-45743";"Ahh! Betrayed? Why, Verline? Begone! I banish you!"
"115740052-0-45744";"This is folly, Kasorayn! You leave me no choice. Allwither, guide my blade!"
"115740052-0-45745";"Go on ahead. Frii and I will meet you near Ivyhame."
"115740052-0-45746";"The Ascendant Order has been hiding here for awhile. Lord Bacaro was right to be concerned."
"115740052-0-45747";"Be careful. I don't think we're alone down here."
"115740052-0-45748";"Take a look at that pile of paper."
"115740052-0-45749";"Look, over on that table!"
"115740052-0-45750";"The Ascendant Lord gave clear orders to this druid alchemist. We need to find that garden!"
"115740052-0-45751";"The seeds are all together now. Close. Just beyond the old stones dreaming in this vale."
"115740052-0-45754";"There's a druid ahead!"
"115740052-0-45755";"Elder Aiven, I need your help."
"115740052-0-45756";"Sounds like a load of nonsense, right? Here, let me write them down for you. Vaster shores and wind-wracked … Huh."
"115740052-0-45757";"Captain Marguerite was as good as her word. Get those supplies distributed at once!"
"115740052-0-45758";"Right away, Count Stefan!"
"115740052-0-45759";"Friend, welcome back to Castle Mornard!"
"115740052-0-45760";"What's this? Here for a frolic?"
"115740052-0-45761";"Friend, we need to find my father!"
"115740052-0-45762";"There! Father, how goes the battle?"
"115740052-0-45763";"Not well. The city's been overrun."
"115740052-0-45764";"Damn these bloody reavers!"
"115740052-0-45765";"Blight it all! We have to find a way for the circles to work together!"
"115740052-0-45766";"Archdruid Ellic! Take heart! We're with you!"
"115740052-0-45767";"From the then to the now. Come, let us speak of what we saw."
"115740052-0-45768";"Make sure the Pounce is ready to sail the moment Queen Ayrenn calls for us."
"115740052-0-45769";"The Pounce is ready. I could use some quiet time for a change."
"115740052-0-45770";"Maybe you spoke too soon, Caska. Look who it is."
"115740052-0-45771";"Damn their eyes! They ransacked the place. Let's see if the case is still here."
"115740052-0-45773";"Archdruid Ellic, allow me to escort you to the cathedral. Friend, I'll rejoin you once the archdruid is safe."
"115740052-0-45775";"A new age of Green begins here!"
"115740052-0-45779";"You have lost, Rahval! Today your blood allows the Dream to come to pass."
"115740052-0-45781";"The cathedral! Father, no!"
"115740052-0-45782";"Druid-kin! You must protect Frii!"
"115740052-0-45783";"Send the wounded and any noncombatants to the cathedral! They'll be safe there."
"115740052-0-45786";"Mercenary, up here! Captain Uldiss entered the next courtyard. I leave her to you!"
"115740052-0-45787";"With me, Gilded Blades. Time to make Sealord Nalos pay!"
"115740052-0-45788";"No, no! Help me! We have to dig them out!"
"115740052-0-45789";"There you are. I … apologize for my behavior earlier."
"115740052-0-45790";"My son is returned! A celebration is in order!"
"115740052-0-45791";"No, Father. The Dreadsails plan to attack Vastyr."
"115740052-0-45792";"What? Mere pirates can't breach our walls!"
"115740052-0-45793";"Once Archdruid Orlaith finds the Stonelore seed, the Firesong and the Dreadsails will combine forces and strike. We must prepare!"
"115740052-0-45794";"Dishonorable wretches! If they've scratched one piece of her hull I'll make them suffer."
"115740052-0-45795";"Song and forest, Y'ffre's breath, let the sacred seeds blossom."
"115740052-0-45796";"The Firesong yield. Orlaith led us to … dark places. Forgive us, Sower of the Dream."
"115740052-0-45797";"I see the moorings have been cut. What about the harbor chain?"
"115740052-0-45798";"Come along, Frii. We shouldn't linger here."
"115740052-0-45799";"If you know your heading, go on ahead. I'll keep an eye on the bird, and we'll meet up with you soon."
"115740052-0-45800";"Firesong Druids. Dead. Laurel's staff. Where is Laurel? Take the staff, Laurel-friend. She would not leave it unattended."
"115740052-0-45801";"Wait … I think I know where that is!"
"115740052-0-45802";"Over here, dear. Time to get this conference started."
"115740052-0-45806";"Now, friends! Step into the wind vortex!"
"115740052-0-45807";"What's happening over there?"
"115740052-0-45808";"Wake up, we're under attack! The Firesong found us in this fog and grappled us. Let's get up on deck and fight them off!"
"115740052-0-45809";"Get to work, Gilded Blades! Cut us free from that wreck!"
"115740052-0-45810";"Nice work! Now get to the quarterdeck and signal if you see anything. There are more ships in the fog. I can smell them!"
"115740052-0-45811";"I knew it! Firesong warships on the port beam! Sound the bell, mercenary. Then get up here and crew this ballista!"
"115740052-0-45812";"Gilded Blades, ready the forward ballista!"
"115740052-0-45813";"Hit amidships! The kindlepitch is burning! Now head aft and—damn! All hands, repel boarders!"
"115740052-0-45814";"Board that scow alongside us. Use her ballistas against that last Firesong ship!"
"115740052-0-45815";"Get to the bow ballista! Hit that ship to starboard with a charge of kindlepitch!"
"115740052-0-45816";"This battle is won. Come, speak with me."
"115740052-0-45817";"Mercenary! The Firesong leader's on deck. Deal with him!"
"115740052-0-45818";"Go below, mercenary. We can handle it from here."
"115740052-0-45819";"Your attention, please. Lady Arabelle requests that everyone join her in the reception hall."
"115740052-0-45820";"Firesong Druids. Proceed with caution, dear."
"115740052-0-45821";"Friend, may we speak?"
"115740052-0-45825";"How? I didn't see my end."
"115740052-0-45828";"Lackwits. Can't … defeat me. Not your place!"
"115740052-0-45831";"My lord, you failed me!"
"115740052-0-45832";"Druid King, speak and I obey."
"115740052-0-45833";"You should never have opposed me!"
"115740052-0-45834";"Power of the mountain, to me!"
"115740052-0-45836";"When the lava flows, the Alliance Leaders will die!"
"115740052-0-45837";"Please, end my pain! And let the Pale Worm choke on his next meal!"
"115740052-0-45838";"Start by setting the fire shard ablaze!"
"115740052-0-45839";"Good. Now heat the sap."
"115740052-0-45840";"Now the most important step. Apply the heated sap to the broken tablet."
"115740052-0-45841";"Well done, my—wait! Why haven't they turned back?"
"115740052-0-45842";"Head to that cavern. I'll deal with their release."
"115740052-0-45843";"Stay your weapons. I bear a message from Archdruid Orlaith."
"115740052-0-45844";"Very well, then. Speak."
"115740052-0-45845";"Ah, Dhulef, our friend returns! But where are Laurel and Frii?"
"115740052-0-45847";"An adventurer? Come here, I'll tell you how to help."
"115740052-0-45848";"Darkness stirs, roots tremble, druids gather. I am the nourisher, the sower. Needed?"
"115740052-0-45849";"I don't think that's wise, Frii. I don't trust the Firesong."
"115740052-0-45850";"Firesong … pulsing, ripping, torn free from the ground. Blood in leaves. A memory."
"115740052-0-45851";"Bring the Sower to the Temple of Y'ffelon. If you refuse, Orlaith will complete the prophecy with the blood of her prisoners."
"115740052-0-45852";"You wouldn't dare!"
"115740052-0-45853";"Archdruid Orlaith will not be denied. Don't make her wait long."
"115740052-0-45854";"Huh. Could have sworn … guess not."
"115740052-0-45855";"My mind. Pain. Rage. Fear. Get it out!"
"115740052-0-45856";"Wait! Not in there!"
"115740052-0-45858";"Come. This way."
"115740052-0-45859";"Well, look who you found. Care for another blade at your side?"
"115740052-0-45860";"Ah, the adventurer returns. Bring me the fire shard and the sap, please."
"115740052-0-45861";"I cannot. The ritual has run its course."
"115740052-0-45862";"Ah, I was wondering if I'd see you again, adventurer."
"115740052-0-45863";"You did it! Now grab the shard and get back here."
"115740052-0-45865";"Stop!"
"115740052-0-45866";"Druids spill blood! No more druids in this story. No more!"
"115740052-0-45867";"Outsider, the Chronicle won't talk to me. You must convince it to let us go."
"115740052-0-45869";"It won't take the Firesong long to notice our presence. We must strike quickly. Come, friend, I know what we must do."
"115740052-0-45870";"Over here! Help! Please, let us out!"
"115740052-0-45871";"Good work, mercenary! You townsfolk, head back and find the Mad Maiden. You'll be safe there."
"115740052-0-45872";"Over here, mate! Get us out of this blasted cage."
"115740052-0-45874";"Then I'll make sure these folk get to safety. Head for the temple, mate."
"115740052-0-45876";"Good timing, friend. I'm going to need your help against the Firesong in this ancient temple."
"115740052-0-45877";"Great work! Let me see how it's growing."
"115740052-0-45878";"These berries are growing in nicely. They'll be ready for the Fauns in no time."
"115740052-0-45879";"Let's regroup outside Fauns' Thicket. Leave the herd to find the berries on their own."
"115740052-0-45880";"Let go, blight take you! Someone has to stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-45881";"It is time, Sower. Quicken the seeds."
"115740052-0-45882";"Wait! What are you doing?"
"115740052-0-45883";"Urdiir, Guardian of Y'ffelon! Awake from your slumber!"
"115740052-0-45884";"Tava's breath, I've been looking all over for you!"
"115740052-0-45885";"A muse-mouth. It has a story to tell us, outsider. I can sense it. Examine the plant. My gift to you."
"115740052-0-45886";"Ugh, no. I'm quite recently taken."
"115740052-0-45887";"Hush, Laniwys, they kept their word. And three could be fun."
"115740052-0-45888";"Just because you free us, doesn't mean you can touch my Ellorien."
"115740052-0-45889";"Strike, friend! Stefan, help me protect Frii!"
"115740052-0-45890";"Forgiveness is for the Draoife to decide. Laurel-friend, I need your wisdom, please."
"115740052-0-45891";"You'll be all right, just lie still."
"115740052-0-45893";"Crown, staff, and gauntlet are whole again. What do I do with them?"
"115740052-0-45894";"Together they make too tempting a target. Let's separate them until a new Draoife can be called. I'll hold the staff. Stefan, the crown. And Lord Bacaro, would you guard the gauntlet?"
"115740052-0-45895";"This Minahel person truly hates joy."
"115740052-0-45896";"Another muse-mouth plant. I sense the Chronicle has more to show us."
"115740052-0-45897";"The crown will be safe here in Castle Mornard."
"115740052-0-45898";"I am honored by your trust. The Society of the Steadfast will protect the gauntlet."
"115740052-0-45899";"Time for a drink, then. And a toast to the hero of Galen!"
"115740052-0-45900";"A portal will do nicely, Dhulef. Let's meet at Castle Mornard."
"115740052-0-45901";"Good to see you, too, Stefan, but never mind about me. We need to help Frii."
"115740052-0-45903";"Quite a majestic site, yes? I hope it stays peaceful."
"115740052-0-45904";"Frii cleared out a lot since I was last here. That, or the Firesong have been tearing things down."
"115740052-0-45905";"Wait. Vines covered that section before."
"115740052-0-45906";"Is that … Frii? And those are wyrds around them. What does it mean?"
"115740052-0-45907";"Look, another marking! We need to examine it."
"115740052-0-45908";"Are those … yes, the sacred seeds! And Frii, growing them into a crown, a staff, and a gauntlet! Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-45909";"Another marking. Examine it, but watch out for the Firesong."
"115740052-0-45910";"A druid, holding the staff and gauntlet. And Frii places the crown upon their head, just like in the prophecy. We need to find Frii, now."
"115740052-0-45911";"Frii used an ancient druid trick. I've seen this before. There should be two druid stones in here. If we turn them, the ward should dissipate."
"115740052-0-45914";"If I had to live in a cave, I'd clean it up more."
"115740052-0-45915";"Well, that looks expensive. Grab it."
"115740052-0-45916";"I guess we know where to find Umindior."
"115740052-0-45917";"Quen! Help! These vines are sharp. They hurt!"
"115740052-0-45918";"They have the relic! In the other room!"
"115740052-0-45919";"Through here! The relic is inside."
"115740052-0-45920";"Glad I was here to find our target. I'll keep watch for more sea witches."
"115740052-0-45921";"Useless. Come on, let's take care of the relic."
"115740052-0-45922";"Toss that magic cloth over it!"
"115740052-0-45923";"Perfect! Now grab it and let's get out of here. We can talk outside."
"115740052-0-45924";"A pity. This one seemed delectable. So be it."
"115740052-0-45925";"Ahh … uncle Mel. The family failure. I look forward to bathing in your blood."
"115740052-0-45926";"Why are you tying me up? This isn't fun at all!"
"115740052-0-45927";"You've breached our sanctum! With those toned muscles of yours."
"115740052-0-45928";"Warn the others. The Scourge has returned!"
"115740052-0-45929";"Let me in, you fools!"
"115740052-0-45931";"What is that? No! Stop! That tickles. I hate being tickled."
"115740052-0-45932";"You think this is funny? I'll make furious love to you, intruder!"
"115740052-0-45933";"Push through the opposition. We must find the distortion."
"115740052-0-45934";"I'm sorry, Niras. I let you down once. I will not do so again. Hunter, to me!"
"115740052-0-45935";"I'll meet you on the deck of the Mad Maiden. Don't mess this up."
"115740052-0-45936";"There! As though a knot has formed in time."
"115740052-0-45937";"Draw the guardian's ire so I can contain the distortion."
"115740052-0-45938";"Watch as I feast, hunter. Blood of my blood will make me so much stronger."
"115740052-0-45939";"We routed them from the library, but I'll make sure nothing was damaged or stolen."
"115740052-0-45940";"That's the tree. Frii was quite fond of it."
"115740052-0-45941";"Go ahead and sprinkle the soil around its base."
"115740052-0-45942";"You place too much trust in those ivy-robed beggars, Stefan."
"115740052-0-45943";"Look! That's Frii on the other side of the chamber!"
"115740052-0-45944";"Ow, she really hurt me."
"115740052-0-45945";"It worked. Secrets remain buried."
"115740052-0-45946";"You did good, Frii, but you look exhausted."
"115740052-0-45947";"Frii is fine. All regrows. Laurel-friend, take the seed."
"115740052-0-45948";"Return to Glimmertarn with the seed. I'll make sure Frii gets out of here safely."
"115740052-0-45949";"I thought for sure something would happen, but this is wonderful!"
"115740052-0-45950";"The seeds! Archdruid Orlaith approaches. Hide, friend of Laurel. Hide!"
"115740052-0-45951";"Here. Behind this rock!"
"115740052-0-45953";"Come on, let's follow him!"
"115740052-0-45954";"The Stonelore have pledged themselves to the defense of Vastyr. We leave shortly."
"115740052-0-45955";"Good, I made it before you headed out. Friend, we need to speak."
"115740052-0-45956";"Friend, let me tell you what Frii has done."
"115740052-0-45957";"We lost Bacaro in Y'ffre's Path. Lady Arabelle is still out there."
"115740052-0-45958";"Thank you, Nyron. The druid-kin and I will take it from here."
"115740052-0-45959";"Five-claw! Thank the Moons! The others followed Lord Bacaro! Go and help them!"
"115740052-0-45960";"My word … the settlement is hardly built. The distortion threw us into the past."
"115740052-0-45961";"Interlopers! Lay down your arms and it will be a quick death!"
"115740052-0-45962";"Even now they get in our way!"
"115740052-0-45963";"I'd hoped to stay clear from violence. But times are dire."
"115740052-0-45964";"Good to smell you, five-claw! Ryvana thinks Bacaro came here for a purpose. He's not far ahead."
"115740052-0-45965";"Now, find the distortion again. Hurry!"
"115740052-0-45966";"It's done. Let's head back to Glimmertarn and prepare my people for war."
"115740052-0-45967";"You lit the beacon. Good work, Laurel."
"115740052-0-45968";"It's always give and take with you, isn't it? I don't know why I even bothered trying to help!"
"115740052-0-45969";"Look! That's the giant cat that accompanied Lady Arabelle!"
"115740052-0-45970";"Over here, my friend! Lady Arabelle followed them through that door!"
"115740052-0-45971";"I'm glad to hear you say that, captain. Ah, good, you're back."
"115740052-0-45972";"All these long seasons, the door has waited just for me."
"115740052-0-45973";"The threads are too many. The knot is too tight. I can't …."
"115740052-0-45974";"Didier? Vitache? They're all … dead."
"115740052-0-45976";"We shall start by punishing the Stonelore. Servant of Y'ffre, come forth!"
"115740052-0-45977";"Tava's beak! I was starting to lose feeling in my legs! Thank you!"
"115740052-0-45978";"This one's claws could not cut the roots! Thank you, traveler!"
"115740052-0-45979";"My mother's going to be worried sick about me!"
"115740052-0-45981";"The song calls to me. Touch the mote, Laurel-friend."
"115740052-0-45982";"The Druid King's apprentice? He is the singer of the song. He will guide us."
"115740052-0-45983";"Someone approaches. Don't let them reach the ritual site!"
"115740052-0-45984";"I'd say he's been through recently, but that scent's known to linger …"
"115740052-0-45985";"This power is ours! I will control my own fate!"
"115740052-0-45986";"Rise, my blessed pet! Defend our home!"
"115740052-0-45988";"Prepare to meet death, outsider!"
"115740052-0-45990";"Rend and slay, my pet!"
"115740052-0-45991";"The distortion. That creature destabilized it!"
"115740052-0-45992";"I fall, but the Firesong burn on …."
"115740052-0-45993";"I can't control it!"
"115740052-0-45994";"Imperial cunning will only get you so far, Elissa …"
"115740052-0-45995";"To the Gloomlantern. To adventure! To letting no good loot go unplundered!"
"115740052-0-45996";"Now, let's get down to business!"
"115740052-0-45997";"The song is strong here. Touch the mote and see what I see."
"115740052-0-45998";"Come, friend of Laurel. The garden is this way."
"115740052-0-45999";"Why did the song lead me here? Touch the mote, Laurel-friend."
"115740052-0-46000";"It moved us. Again. But what era?"
"115740052-0-46001";"Up the rope seems the only way out. Go. I'll catch my breath."
"115740052-0-46002";"Interesting. An old druidic summoning chamber. I want to examine these carvings."
"115740052-0-46003";"What happened here? Did the distortion cause this?"
"115740052-0-46004";"Fire falls from the sky. Buildings destroyed. Such chaos."
"115740052-0-46005";"A temple of Peryite? What have they done?"
"115740052-0-46006";"Go to the temple. I need to understand what's happened."
"115740052-0-46007";"More shaking. And animals. And druids somewhere. Let's just hurry."
"115740052-0-46008";"There you are! I've been looking for you, mate!"
"115740052-0-46009";"I knew the followers of the Allwither opposed my decision to choose no successor. Still, I did not expect such bloodshed."
"115740052-0-46010";"Up here, Aiven. Elder Verline waits in the ritual chamber."
"115740052-0-46011";"The ritual chamber is beyond the door just ahead."
"115740052-0-46012";"Hang on, let's talk."
"115740052-0-46013";"Here you are. The temporal distortion wasn't in the tower."
"115740052-0-46014";"The Ascendant Order's forces pulled back to the main entrance into the mountain. Siravaen and her pirates went after them."
"115740052-0-46015";"The spot Laurel mentioned should be just ahead."
"115740052-0-46016";"This tunnel cuts deep into the mountain. Hopefully, it will lead us to Lord Bacaro."
"115740052-0-46017";"That volcanic activity is … concerning. I'll have to keep an eye on it."
"115740052-0-46018";"Sweet Mara, look at that volcano. We need to hurry!"
"115740052-0-46019";"The Druid King calls forth the spirit of the volcano! Soon our enemies will perish in lava and flame!"
"115740052-0-46020";"Bacaro has started. We have to hurry!"
"115740052-0-46021";"These creatures were called to protect this place. They have grown wild. Fierce."
"115740052-0-46022";"A hall within the hill. The court of the Druid King."
"115740052-0-46023";"The song is clearer now. Above us. Toward the rising sun."
"115740052-0-46024";"The Ivy Throne. Careful, friend of Laurel. I sense a powerful guardian nearby."
"115740052-0-46026";"Thank you, Laurel-friend, but the volcano spirit has awakened."
"115740052-0-46027";"Wind vortex. Must summon. Keep them back while I sing."
"115740052-0-46028";"Something else is needed. Something of mine."
"115740052-0-46030";"The lava is rising. We don't have much time!"
"115740052-0-46031";"Bacaro wields the regalia. He commands the spirit to awaken and now the volcano awakens, too."
"115740052-0-46032";"Lord Bacaro truly is insane. Stay with Frii, my friend. I need to warn the others."
"115740052-0-46033";"The false king is farther up the mountain. I will help in any way I can."
"115740052-0-46034";"When Mount Firesong erupts, many lives will be lost. Lava will consume the archipelago."
"115740052-0-46035";"The spirit of Mount Firesong!"
"115740052-0-46036";"Ancient pacts, broken. Ancient promises, ignored. The false king must pay."
"115740052-0-46037";"I can't be stopped. Not by you. Not by the nature spirit. Look how the very mountain obeys me!"
"115740052-0-46038";"The spirit created an avatar. Defend yourself, Laurel-friend."
"115740052-0-46039";"If you are certain, my king. Yet I wish there was another way."
"115740052-0-46040";"Y'ffre, hear us. Return crown, staff, and gauntlet to the seeds from whence they came."
"115740052-0-46041";"Farewell, old friend. This temple becomes my tomb. Deliver the seeds … and seal the Ivy Throne …."
"115740052-0-46042";"I fear they built this temple around the knot. Let's go."
"115740052-0-46043";"Well, I was right. Here it is."
"115740052-0-46044";"Matriarch! Allow us to neutralize the distortion!"
"115740052-0-46045";"I've waited years for you. Preparing. Seething. Gaining in power."
"115740052-0-46046";"I cannot allow this to continue. I must destroy it."
"115740052-0-46047";"No! How could you?"
"115740052-0-46048";"This spot is even nicer than I expected. Let me check on the berries."
"115740052-0-46049";"Younger Fauns play up here. They'll love these berries!"
"115740052-0-46050";"These sure grew in nicely. Aww, look how happy Mohair is!"
"115740052-0-46051";"Yes! The fruit is starting to bud. How exciting!"
"115740052-0-46052";"Ah, friend! What brings you back to these humble halls?"
"115740052-0-46053";"Keep the Matriarch away from me while I focus!"
"115740052-0-46054";"What's this? Rats skulking in our shadows?"
"115740052-0-46055";"So much. All of time. It's so strong!"
"115740052-0-46056";"The knot is … unravelling. I can pull us through …."
"115740052-0-46059";"Don't stop, my brothers and sisters! The spirit of the volcano stirs!"
"115740052-0-46060";"Give up, my friend. We both want the same thing. An end to this stupid war and something better than the Ruby Throne!"
"115740052-0-46061";"Spirit of Mount Firesong, lend me your strength. Give me the power to destroy my enemies!"
"115740052-0-46062";"The spirit is too powerful. Once unleashed, it cannot be controlled."
"115740052-0-46063";"I am Lord Bacaro, the Ascendant Lord, the Druid King! Soon the alliances will be nothing but cinders and ash!"
"115740052-0-46064";"He joined with the spirit. Now the volcano will follow its nature. It will explode."
"115740052-0-46065";"Over here! I will summon another wind vortex."
"115740052-0-46066";"Step into the wind before the lava consumes us."
"115740052-0-46067";"All right Mohair, want to say goodbye to the herd before we leave?"
"115740052-0-46069";"The spirit has been restrained for too many seasons. It wants to unleash the full power of the volcano."
"115740052-0-46070";"Take in that aroma, folks! That's the Chef Rhazeez guarantee!"
"115740052-0-46071";"You there, traveler! You look as adventurous as my taste buds! Care to help the greatest chef in Tamriel with an urgent task?"
"115740052-0-46072";"I'll chop you up and feed what's left to the sharks!"
"115740052-0-46073";"We have emerged. I feel … different."
"115740052-0-46074";"It worked. I knew it would."
"115740052-0-46075";"Ah Eyfi, isn't this place wondrous? I am positively enchanted by the primitive styles of the architecture. What could it all mean?"
"115740052-0-46076";"Archdruid Orlaith, return the sacred seeds."
"115740052-0-46077";"You're not paying me for conversation. No amount of coin would be enough to respond to your mindless ranting."
"115740052-0-46078";"Quickly, friend. Place the gauntlet and crown to form a ritual circle."
"115740052-0-46079";"Now Frii is the spirit of Mount Firesong. Now the volcano will be still. Goodbye, friend. And thank you."
"115740052-0-46080";"Five-claw! Lady Arabelle is waiting for you at Mornard Castle."
"115740052-0-46081";"You, over here! These spriggans are becoming a real problem … best to take them by surprise. See if you can get behind this one and kick it in, huh?"
"115740052-0-46082";"Yes! Burn, burn you bastard! Thank you, my friend!"
"115740052-0-46083";"Wait, what was that?"
"115740052-0-46084";"Naive to think that a gate stops me."
"115740052-0-46085";"Cowards! I've come to take back what's mine!"
"115740052-0-46086";"Fools! Throw yourselves against my blade!"
"115740052-0-46088";"Follow the captain!"
"115740052-0-46089";"Oh, thank you, stranger! Now kill that beast!"
"115740052-0-46090";"My friend! I owe you my life! I swear my service to you. I shall be your companion from this day forth."
"115740052-0-46091";"That said, I forgot I have somewhere else to be! Good luck!"
"115740052-0-46092";"Such vibrant greens, such rich blues! I've never seen colors so resplendent before!"
"115740052-0-46093";"These are the tunnels my father mentioned! The Sea Elves are already here! We must find Archdruid Ellic!"
"115740052-0-46094";"Damn, no sign of Archdruid Ellic! He must have been chased out. Let's keep going!"
"115740052-0-46095";"Away, Sea Elves! I will not fall to you!"
"115740052-0-46096";"You there! Your life or your jewels …. Uh, give me your coin and you won't get the pointy end—no."
"115740052-0-46097";"My eyes and ears deceive me. Do you speak? Are you quiet? Is the grass shriveled or vibrant?"
"115740052-0-46098";"Archdruid Rahval, are you and the Stonelore ready to depart for Vastyr?"
"115740052-0-46099";"We are. Laurel, take Frii and hide in the wilderness. They cannot fall into Orlaith's hands."
"115740052-0-46100";"But I—yes, archdruid. I understand."
"115740052-0-46101";"Welcome, I am on a quest to experience all the frogs across this island and see beyond time itself. Can you help me dig this one up? He's ready for a lick."
"115740052-0-46102";"Yes! Wonderful, how exciting!"
"115740052-0-46103";"Well hello there! If I could just have one lick …."
"115740052-0-46104";"I never noticed your eyes before. They're like pearls at sunset."
"115740052-0-46105";"Well, your smile shines like sunlight off the ocean."
"115740052-0-46106";"How about we find other parts to compliment?"
"115740052-0-46107";"What's all this? You two are on duty!"
"115740052-0-46108";"We started talking and …. You know, you could join us?"
"115740052-0-46109";"Fraternize with my subordinates? Hmm, You two do look rather … delicious."
"115740052-0-46110";"I think less of you than I do of barnacles on a hull."
"115740052-0-46111";"My blood boils when I lay eyes on you!"
"115740052-0-46112";"Gods! I need you right now, you scheming harridan."
"115740052-0-46113";"Did you hear that? Athiel told me to visit her bunk tonight."
"115740052-0-46114";"You could do that. Or, you could come by my bunk instead."
"115740052-0-46115";"You sly seadog, I thought you'd never ask."
"115740052-0-46117";"Everyone, to your stations. Mercenary, get below decks and stay out of the way! Next port, Vastyr!"
"115740052-0-46119";"I keep hoping he'll rejoin a herd, but he always comes back to me."
"115740052-0-46120";"Quiet you fools or they'll—damn it! Hurry, go!"
"115740052-0-46121";"You took my ship! My crew! I'm taking back both!"
"115740052-0-46122";"Goodbye. Sorry for bothering you. Uh, please don't follow me."
"115740052-0-46123";"Captain. Captain look! I'm tough!"
"115740052-0-46124";"It's gone. Wait … we've moved. Look around."
"115740052-0-46126";"They're on the run! We'll deal with these, lordling! Gilded Blades, forward!"
"115740052-0-46127";"To the cathedral! We'll be safe there!"
"115740052-0-46128";"Kikooo! Treasure, yes? Treasure here? Treasure near! Squawk!"
"115740052-0-46129";"Kiko! Beeko! Treasure seek-o! Squawk!"
"115740052-0-46130";"If that ship leaves Windwrack, it'll be too late for me to catch that Khajiit."
"115740052-0-46131";"Friend, what a pleasant surprise!"
"115740052-0-46132";"You seek a fight? Then, come interloper!"
"115740052-0-46134";"I'll throw your corpse in the lava!"
"115740052-0-46135";"I barely … escaped the collapse. Gods, how did this happen?"
"115740052-0-46136";"The Eldertide are willing, but we have yet to choose new leaders. And we still distrust the Firesong."
"115740052-0-46137";"The Firesong are aware of our mistakes. We don't expect forgiveness, but we want a chance to make amends. I promise, our next leader will have less aggressive aspirations."
"115740052-0-46138";"Look. The Green has not forsaken this place of stone. There are flowers. Insects. Life."
"115740052-0-46139";"We have an agreement, Captain Siravaen? You'll get us to Y'ffelon and we'll do the rest?"
"115740052-0-46140";"We do, Sir Stefan. The skiff at the pier will take you to the Mad Maiden when you're ready."
"115740052-0-46141";"The mainlander champion? Face me and die!"
"115740052-0-46142";"Great work, my friend. One less irritable tree to worry about."
"115740052-0-46143";"Well, never mind then! I suppose we're doing this the hard way."
"115740052-0-46144";"Nita, Asha, I need your aid!"
"115740052-0-46145";"My serpents will tear you apart!"
"115740052-0-46146";"I cannot fall! I am Sealord Nalos!"
"115740052-0-46147";"Hello, Frii. Are you ready to go to Y'ffelon with me?"
"115740052-0-46148";"Yes, friend-Dhulef. I am ready."
"115740052-0-46150";"Let Rahval and the seeds go, Orlaith!"
"115740052-0-46151";"Silence!"
"115740052-0-46152";"Come Eyfi, there's no time to dawdle, we've much to research! And to think you're privy to it all as my assistant, how lucky you are."
"115740052-0-46153";"I'm not here for you. I'm here to get away from my homeland. My steadfast sense of honor is the only thing that's keeping me by your side, staying your final meeting with the Divines."
"115740052-0-46154";"When next we meet, you will bow to me. The new Druid King!"
"115740052-0-46155";"Nalos! Time to pay for turning the Dreadsails into traitors!"
"115740052-0-46156";"The duchess is much too busy right now, courier."
"115740052-0-46157";"What about me? I've been waiting hours to make my delivery!"
"115740052-0-46158";"Take your wagon to the jousting tents. The duchess will send someone to deal with you shortly."
"115740052-0-46159";"She must be in the temple. Come with me, knight. Friend, I leave the rescue of the captives in your hands!"
"115740052-0-46160";"Sir Stefan! The Firesong hold our folk in Cinderwash, just as you thought. No sign of Archdruid Orlaith though."
"115740052-0-46161";"Thank you for saving us! The druids hold more prisoners to the southeast."
"115740052-0-46162";"That's better! Now, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-46163";"Wait. Is that the cat?"
"115740052-0-46164";"Not so close, five-claw."
"115740052-0-46165";"Well. They took their time. But Raz has learned what he needed."
"115740052-0-46166";"That door. See if the key we found will unlock it."
"115740052-0-46167";"I got Sir Stefan to return to the castle. Talk to me before you go see him."
"115740052-0-46168";"We're gonna need more than a little heat to sear something that's born in a volcano, so …."
"115740052-0-46169";"Ah, you've returned!"
"115740052-0-46170";"A druid alchemist's workshop. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-46171";"Powerful spirits often guard locations such as this. Be careful."
"115740052-0-46172";"That armor … it looks just like the Ascendant Lord, doesn't it?"
"115740052-0-46173";"Down there! Let's get a closer look."
"115740052-0-46174";"Let's get these supplies on board. The people of Galen need our assistance."
"115740052-0-46175";"I'll take care of things here on High Isle in your absence, Lord Bacaro. May the society's efforts on Galen bring the people of Vastyr some relief."
"115740052-0-46176";"Hero of the Systres, you're always welcome here! The duchess will see you in the knight's wing."
"115740052-0-46177";"Ah, there you are. I hope you've had more success than I, my friend."
"115740052-0-46178";"The Firesong will do whatever they can to stop us from reaching the archdruid. Be prepared for anything."
"115740052-0-46179";"The passage to the right! That's Laurel's voice!"
"115740052-0-46180";"Laurel! Hurry, friend, free her. I'll stand watch."
"115740052-0-46181";"Laurel! I wasn't sure I'd see you again. Are you hurt?"
"115740052-0-46182";"Thank you, friend. Archdruid Orlaith has already started her ritual! We have to get to the tomb!"
"115740052-0-46183";"I'll wait here. Send anyone you rescue back to the Mad Maiden, and I'll see them to safety. Good hunting!"
"115740052-0-46184";"We stand here today because of Lord Bacaro. What he brought together through the Society of the Steadfast, and what he tried to bring about as the Ascendant Lord."
"115740052-0-46185";"Instead of dividing us, instead of defeating and conquering us, he showed us what's possible when we work side-by-side."
"115740052-0-46186";"And through the courage and sacrifice of many of the people gathered here, as well as the nature spirit Frii, we persevered and won the day! Now, to our royal guests I say, let's recognize our friend and then start the talks!"
"115740052-0-46187";"First, we'll get a nice sear on this steak. Smell that? That's sulfur, folks!"
"115740052-0-46188";"Niras, stop! I will not allow you to claim one more soul."
"115740052-0-46189";"And now we'll deglaze with the brandy. Hoo! Watch those fumes …"
"115740052-0-46190";"And now, we'll toss our blistered peppers to infuse some heat and—look out!"
"115740052-0-46191";"Well, not what I expected, but at least it was a good show!"
"115740052-0-46192";"Look! Frii holds the regalia of the Druid King!"
"115740052-0-46193";"Thank you. I couldn't hold out much longer."
"115740052-0-46194";"He won't escape. This way!"
"115740052-0-46195";"Druid-kin! Thank Y'ffre you're here! Something terrible has happened. This way!"
"115740052-0-46197";"Look familiar, Kiko? Is this the treasure your master hid away all those years ago?"
"115740052-0-46198";"You defy the Firesong? Fool. You will die on this deck."
"115740052-0-46199";"Octin? I'll find a way to restore you. I swear it!"
"115740052-0-46200";"Joslin? Don't worry, cousin. I'll find a way to fix things."
"115740052-0-46201";"Laurel, go with our friend. Make sure Frii is all right."
"115740052-0-46202";"Begin gathering your belongings. We'll make for Vastyr once everyone has arrived."
"115740052-0-46203";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-46204";"This is the trail they took into Y'ffre's Path."
"115740052-0-46205";"They went this way."
"115740052-0-46206";"The ruins on the western wall of the hollow. That's got to be where everyone headed."
"115740052-0-46207";"Ascendant knights! Firesong allies! Witness the awakening!"
"115740052-0-46208";"Wrong. Bad. Do not do this."
"115740052-0-46209";"Obey your king, Sower! The spirit here will awaken and do my bidding. The prophecy demands it!"
"115740052-0-46210";"You would oppose me, my friends? Don't you see? I will bring peace to Tamriel!"
"115740052-0-46211";"The Sower and the seed belong to the Firesong!"
"115740052-0-46212";"Look, a ward protects that far door. Did Frii cast that? We need to find a way to open it."
"115740052-0-46214";"The siege has begun! Quickly, to Sir Stefan's side!"
"115740052-0-46216";"There should be another stone nearby. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-46217";"You're too late, fools! The crown belongs to the Ascendant Order now."
"115740052-0-46218";"That did it. The door should be open now."
"115740052-0-46219";"That's for my brother, you worthless eel! And for our king."
"115740052-0-46220";"I'm no help with things like this. Find me when you're finished."
"115740052-0-46221";"Is this your best? No wonder you flee at my approach!"
"115740052-0-46222";"Keep him busy while I prepare something special for the occasion!"
"115740052-0-46223";"Hope is lost. Embrace your despair."
"115740052-0-46224";"Your stubbornness is misguided. I will have your blood!"
"115740052-0-46225";"You have no right to the relic!"
"115740052-0-46226";"I'll kill you! No matter how gorgeous you are."
"115740052-0-46227";"Here. The trail leads to the world beneath. I shall open the way. Be ready, hunter."
"115740052-0-46228";"Blight, what a slaughter!"
"115740052-0-46229";"I've got an idea of how to hurt him bad! Tell me when you're ready!"
"115740052-0-46230";"I'm ready again. Tell me when!"
"115740052-0-46231";"No more alliances. No more Ruby Throne. The era of the Ivy Throne begins now!"
"115740052-0-46232";"Oh, hello again. What brings you to the vine district?"
"115740052-0-46233";"Intruders? Here's how we deal with pests in my garden."
"115740052-0-46234";"Stop them, spirit! Do what you were summoned to do!"
"115740052-0-46235";"One ballista bolt with a charge of kindlepitch ready! Don't miss!"
"115740052-0-46237";"Hold them back! Let no Dreadsails get past your blades!"
"115740052-0-46238";"You think so? All right, I'm off to find someone to use this on. Thanks for your help!"
"115740052-0-46239";"Help! Somebody! Help!"
"115740052-0-46240";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-46241";"These Sea Elf pirates become more brazen every day. When is House Mornard going to do something?"
"115740052-0-46242";"You know, House Dufort never has these problems on High Isle."
"115740052-0-46243";"That's not entirely true. There are those incidents with the Ascendant Order."
"115740052-0-46244";"What rubbish! Druids defending the city? More likely, they're here to impose their strange religion and topple our civilized order."
"115740052-0-46245";"Now, now. All of my best creams and ointments come from vendors in the druid district. They're not all bad."
"115740052-0-46246";"Well, that's true. Regardless, I refuse to hug a tree or pray to a frond or whatever it is those druids do."
"115740052-0-46247";"The cathedral …  it just crumbled … and with all those people inside …."
"115740052-0-46248";"Why would the Divines allow such a thing to happen? And with Count Mornard inside!"
"115740052-0-46249";"I heard that Sir Stefan survived the attack. That's something, at least."
"115740052-0-46250";"Did you hear? I knew it! This was all the fault of those damn druids!"
"115740052-0-46251";"Well, some druids. But Count Stefan and that hero from the mainland saved us."
"115740052-0-46252";"Well, at least House Mornard finely accomplished something. Perhaps Vastyr has a future after all."
"115740052-0-46253";"Rogue knights, druid prophecies, erupting volcanoes … if it's not one thing, it's another."
"115740052-0-46254";"Surely the mainland doesn't have these kinds of problems. It's just lucky for us a mainlander hero was around to lend a hand."
"115740052-0-46255";"Still, I'm seriously reconsidering my decision to move to the archipelago. I was promised sun and waves, not near-death experiences."
"115740052-0-46256";"Your people are in as much danger as everyone else, Galphen. Sea Elves make no distinctions when it comes to staging raids."
"115740052-0-46257";"I didn't say we weren't, Dame Fayda. But the Stonelore can fend for themselves. We always have."
"115740052-0-46258";"I'm simply suggesting that you bring your people into the city. The Vine District has room enough for more druids."
"115740052-0-46259";"I can't believe the Firesong betrayed us. Attacking the Draoife … how will that bring the circles together?"
"115740052-0-46260";"The Firesong will answer for this crime, Galphen. By House Mornard's honor, this I so swear!"
"115740052-0-46261";"I don't want vengeance, Fayda. I don't want more death. I just … I just want my friends back."
"115740052-0-46262";"Please, Galphen. Remain in the city. There's a danger coming. Vastyr's walls can protect us all."
"115740052-0-46263";"Yes, the city walls can protect the city folk. And the druids of the Vine District. But what about the rest of my brothers and sisters?"
"115740052-0-46264";"Sir Stefan has a plan. Together we can all defend Galen from the Dreadsail pirates. It just makes sense."
"115740052-0-46265";"Please. I'm looking for Dame Fayda. She was with the knights protecting the cathedral district during the attack."
"115740052-0-46266";"We're still sorting this all out. As soon as I have news about Dame Fayda, I'll send word to you, druid."
"115740052-0-46267";"I—of course, I understand. After the cathedral collapsed, I just want to know that she's safe. I'll check back later."
"115740052-0-46268";"Sir Balnon, I heard the Firesong took captives to Y'ffelon. Mornard knights, commoners, and druids alike. Is this true?"
"115740052-0-46269";"Galphen, I know you're concerned about Dame Fayda, but I can neither confirm nor deny those reports."
"115740052-0-46270";"The Firesong have broken the path and someone has to do something! I'll volunteer to help. Tell me who to talk to!"
"115740052-0-46271";"Sir Balnon told me how insistent you were, Galphen. Called you a royal pain in the arse!"
"115740052-0-46272";"I couldn't bear thinking of you, trapped in a cage on Y'ffelon. If my complaints helped convince Sir Stefan to save you and the others, I can live with the insult."
"115740052-0-46273";"Sir Stefan and the mainlander. They saved us all and put an end to Archdruid Orlaith. And brought me back to you."
"115740052-0-46274";"I thought our troubles were over after all the death and destruction, but something worse is coming, Fayda."
"115740052-0-46275";"I feel it, too. Like a dark storm on the horizon."
"115740052-0-46276";"I'm worried, Fayda. I don't think Galen's troubles are over."
"115740052-0-46277";"Was all this bloodshed really the result of a druidic prophecy, Galphen?"
"115740052-0-46278";"I'm afraid so, Fayda. Sometimes religious conviction can drive even the best of us to do terrible things."
"115740052-0-46279";"Well, at least the Ascendant Lord has been defeated. And we found each other, Galphen. That's the sunlight breaking through the clouds."
"115740052-0-46280";"Watch the tunnel! I have no wish to find Siravaen's blade in my back."
"115740052-0-46281";"Curse it! The seed must be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-46282";"Remember my warning. The Dreadsails are coming for Vastyr."
"115740052-0-46284";"Mainlander? Come, tell me what happened at Castle Tonnere."
"115740052-0-46285";"You can't win! Sealord Nalos is coming for Vastyr!"
"115740052-0-46286";"Spirit of the volcano! Send your avatar to destroy my enemies!"
"115740052-0-46288";"Hey, Scippio! It's us. Open up! We got news for the boss."
"115740052-0-46290";"Proxy, fate has plucked you from the flotsam of chaos for this specific moment."
"115740052-0-46291";"Over here, mate!"
"115740052-0-46292";"Once you select a portal, the others shall close. Let fate lead you, proxy."
"115740052-0-46293";"Let us go inside, friend of Laurel."
"115740052-0-46294";"You can't get past me."
"115740052-0-46295";"I won't be defeated!"
"115740052-0-46296";"I won't be defeated!"
"115740052-0-46300";"Ah, fate's chosen! Good. I thought I'd have to fend off another assault on the glyphic."
"115740052-0-46301";"You're back. How did the meeting with Count Stefan go?"
"115740052-0-46302";"Ah, good to see you, my dear. Za'ji found you, I take it? Come, we have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-46303";"Now … take your place. Touch the mote and I will summon Urdiir the Guardian."
"115740052-0-46304";"I am with you, Laurel-friend. You are Elder Aiven. And there is King Kasorayn. I remember him."
"115740052-0-46305";"The seeds are near. Their presence calls. Be cautious. We will soon be upon them."
"115740052-0-46306";"The Druid King is older. Careworn. Many seasons passed since he left me with the wyrds."
"115740052-0-46307";"The Temple of Y'ffelon. I hear its song, even in this dream."
"115740052-0-46310";"Gather round. We have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-46311";"The currents of fate ebb and flow, once again carrying you to the required shore."
"115740052-0-46312";"I need energy to help you. Destroy the shards and I will absorb their essence."
"115740052-0-46313";"Another eruption is building. Destroy the shards and I can aid you."
"115740052-0-46314";"Mildanor keeps a room in this cellar, proxy."
"115740052-0-46315";"Mildanor …."
"115740052-0-46316";"Look around, proxy. We must ascertain what transpired here."
"115740052-0-46317";"The one the Golden Eye foretold? You honor me, Leramil!"
"115740052-0-46318";"Greetings, Bassian. This is fate's chosen."
"115740052-0-46319";"That will be all, sentry. But what's this? A druid and Lady Arabelle's assistant?"
"115740052-0-46320";"Forgive the intrusion, captain. My friend will explain."
"115740052-0-46321";"Go, proxy. I want to get Bassian's opinion on the encoded letter you brought me."
"115740052-0-46322";"Appears we both arrived too late, friend."
"115740052-0-46323";"Another of the faithful, murdered? What happened here?"
"115740052-0-46324";"Wait, friend! I'll signal Frii to call upon the guardian. Then we can make our move!"
"115740052-0-46325";"Friend, let's clear the deck!"
"115740052-0-46326";"That ballista is loaded! Go ahead. Take the shot!"
"115740052-0-46327";"Friend, the Firesong elder set the ship aflame!"
"115740052-0-46328";"I never liked you, Leramil. Think you're better than the faithful."
"115740052-0-46329";"The only thing you're faithful to, Dralys, is your own ambition."
"115740052-0-46330";"Join me, Leramil. My new patrons will share the secret they seek once they pry it out of Apocrypha."
"115740052-0-46331";"There you are! Everyone else is aboard the Mad Maiden and sailing for Galen, Stefan. I can open a portal to Vastyr, unless you plan to swim."
"115740052-0-46332";"Frii! We're here! Awaken the guardian!"
"115740052-0-46333";"The regalia are not for you, false king!"
"115740052-0-46335";"Firesong, destroy this creature!"
"115740052-0-46336";"Defiance is pointless, Sower. Watch as I slaughter your friends!"
"115740052-0-46337";"Ah, there you are! Did you evade or dispatch the ambush I set for you? No matter. I'll take your glyphic now."
"115740052-0-46338";"Huzzah! Good work, friend!"
"115740052-0-46341";"Every possibility coalesces into this moment. Come, mortal. Speak with the One Who Knows."
"115740052-0-46342";"Chef Rhazeez, it's an honor to meet y … AAAGH!"
"115740052-0-46343";"May the Great Eye keep you in his sight, chosen. If I learn more of this threat, I'll contact you."
"115740052-0-46344";"As I said, you honor me, Leramil. But why bring the chosen here? That was dangerous for all of us."
"115740052-0-46345";"Desperate circumstances demand risks, Bassian. I just hope fate's chosen is ready for what comes next."
"115740052-0-46346";"Sometimes, Leramil, you can be as inscrutable as the Great Eye …."
"115740052-0-46347";"Both I and the chosen arrived too late, Leramil."
"115740052-0-46348";"Curious to see you in this place, at this particular time, Dralys."
"115740052-0-46349";"Let's not forget who's actually one of the Great Eye's faithful, Leramil. Now, I have my own investigation to continue."
"115740052-0-46351";"The deal is done, just as fate foresaw. Leramil will explain the rest. Now I must take my leave."
"115740052-0-46352";"We can talk back in the Dune outskirts, proxy."
"115740052-0-46353";"I told everyone to stop fussing. I feel much better. Now let's talk."
"115740052-0-46354";"I hope you'll reconsider. This threat endangers us all."
"115740052-0-46355";"The Gilded Blades aren't mercenaries to call on to clean up your mess, Count Stefan."
"115740052-0-46356";"I knew you'd come around, Siravaen. Let's meet at the Vastyr docks."
"115740052-0-46357";"Avenge me, my pet …."
"115740052-0-46358";"My pet! You'll pay for this, outsider!"
"115740052-0-46359";"Now this council suffers the wrath of the Firesong!"
"115740052-0-46360";"Five-claw! Za'ji has found you!"
"115740052-0-46361";"Fool! My crew serves me even in death!"
"115740052-0-46362";"Bah! I see why Nalos detests you!"
"115740052-0-46363";"The wind vortex is ready."
"115740052-0-46364";"Over here, my dear. Count Stefan and I have something for you."
"115740052-0-46365";"Galen and the entire archipelago owe you a debt, my friend. You have my thanks."
"115740052-0-46366";"The druids will never forget what you and Frii did to save us."
"115740052-0-46367";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-46368";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-46369";"I assure you, Lady Arabelle. I'm more committed than ever to the Society of the Steadfast's mission of peace."
"115740052-0-46370";"Archdruid, protect us!"
"115740052-0-46371";"There! That's my Gwen just ahead!"
"115740052-0-46372";"Not Rahval, damn you!"
"115740052-0-46373";"Runes of destruction. Powerful magic that overcame Mildanor's wards of protection."
"115740052-0-46374";"Let us compare observations, proxy."
"115740052-0-46375";"He must have snatched that from whoever attacked him before he died."
"115740052-0-46376";"One last book to close. Pour the remaining water on the spirit orb."
"115740052-0-46377";"Please, Gwen, I know you're in there. Just hold on."
"115740052-0-46378";"They've come for the artifact! Do not let them near it!"
"115740052-0-46379";"Who sent you? How did you learn of our discovery?"
"115740052-0-46380";"The Talisman of Saint Vorys will be mine. And I'm all yours, Rilasi—if you can catch me."
"115740052-0-46381";"This is your last heist, Lark of Rosgard! Mark my words!"
"115740052-0-46383";"Meet me here when you're done."
"115740052-0-46384";"He's here! The Lark is in the crypts—he just slipped past!"
"115740052-0-46385";"Poor Factotum. A few missing components and you cease to function."
"115740052-0-46386";"A creature of flesh, but without the sign of the painted? Come here."
"115740052-0-46387";"The way that priest tripped all of your protective runes—it's almost like they're working against you, Rilasi."
"115740052-0-46388";"I'm locking this door behind me. You can see yourself out."
"115740052-0-46389";"Rilasi, who's your friend? Are you ever going to introduce us?"
"115740052-0-46390";"Alert. Deception. Danger. Repair Construct. Stop the betrayer."
"115740052-0-46391";"And the talisman is mine."
"115740052-0-46392";"You know, if you leave that replica where it is, the high priest would be none the wiser. It could be our little secret."
"115740052-0-46393";"Green ichor? Could that be the source of this frenzy? This poor hive."
"115740052-0-46394";"Everything went off without a … wait. Where is everyone?"
"115740052-0-46395";"I'll meet you at the ruins. Remember to keep Shadeya talking as long as possible."
"115740052-0-46396";"Walker? Come no closer, or this one will bleed out the elder. Where is the thief?"
"115740052-0-46397";"Finally. I'll meet you outside. Free the prisoners if you haven't already."
"115740052-0-46398";"Intruders? What's going on here—"
"115740052-0-46399";"Shadeya, please—this one is sure the walker means no harm. We can talk through this, yes?"
"115740052-0-46403";"Is someone down there? Please, help us!"
"115740052-0-46404";"How can we honor our ancestors if the Necropolis is closed?"
"115740052-0-46405";"The abbot ordered the closure for your own good, citizen. Curate Gadayn, make sure no one enters."
"115740052-0-46406";"Prelate? Oh, of course. No one enters the Necropolis."
"115740052-0-46407";"The Necropolis is closed? Whoever heard of such a thing?"
"115740052-0-46408";"Someone's alive? Let's hurry!"
"115740052-0-46409";"From my notes, I think this is, was, Gine. One of the chief egg-hands."
"115740052-0-46410";"Fomesa! Is she …? Oh, no."
"115740052-0-46411";"No! You will pay for this, walker! Surrender the talisman, or the others die!"
"115740052-0-46413";"Please walker, save this one's family! Give her the talisman if you must!"
"115740052-0-46414";"That's Rilasi. Follow my lead and play along."
"115740052-0-46415";"These smooth-skinned fools will regret capturing me."
"115740052-0-46416";"My thanks, walker!"
"115740052-0-46417";"This one shall pay your favor forward!"
"115740052-0-46418";"You are a true friend to the Baandari!"
"115740052-0-46419";"Step forth, mortal. Know that you stand in the presence of Hermaeus Mora. We must converse."
"115740052-0-46420";"Fate takes many paths, mortal. Find Leramil in Necrom and choose wisely."
"115740052-0-46421";"Welcome to my safehouse, proxy."
"115740052-0-46422";"Your choice must be your own, proxy. Hermaeus Mora was clear about that."
"115740052-0-46423";"There. Three paths are now arrayed before you. Which will you pick?"
"115740052-0-46424";"Give the compass a squeeze. It will tell you the locations of my remarkable creatures."
"115740052-0-46425";"Good, you're back. Just as we planned."
"115740052-0-46426";"No no no, what have they done to her? The mine is dead without its queen!"
"115740052-0-46427";"Perhaps we can still harvest her pheromone gland? It's the only thing that might help us rebuild."
"115740052-0-46428";"Thank you. The Consortium may be able to rebuild the hive with that. Poor thing."
"115740052-0-46429";"These dung beetles insulted me for the last time. Tied up with Trolls?"
"115740052-0-46430";"I thought I'd be tied up there for ages."
"115740052-0-46432";"Oh, good. I was starting to get worried."
"115740052-0-46433";"Why are we stopping here when these Dark Elves lurk about the edges of our camp?"
"115740052-0-46434";"All may bask in the talisman's divine glory—from a respectful distance, please!"
"115740052-0-46435";"Excuse me! Please step back from the relic!"
"115740052-0-46436";"Oh Shadeya, you worry too much! Surely they mean us no harm."
"115740052-0-46437";"Quickly, into the crypts! We can't let him get away!"
"115740052-0-46438";"Not like a mundane compass, eh? You'll know where to find my creatures while it's in your possession."
"115740052-0-46439";"Your work here is done, proxy. Still, we—hmm. That Dark Elf also bears the mark of fate. I shall speak with you momentarily, curate."
"115740052-0-46440";"See you around, stranger. And send my fondest farewells to Rilasi, will you?"
"115740052-0-46441";"Fate's threads still lead to two other locations. Choose another portal, proxy."
"115740052-0-46442";"One more thread of fate to investigate, proxy. Take this portal and see where it leads."
"115740052-0-46444";"You emerge. Come, speak."
"115740052-0-46446";"We have examined the threads of fate and learned much. Return to the Necrom Bindery and we shall determine our next steps."
"115740052-0-46447";"Overseer! I'm glad you all made it out. With your expertise and the Queen's pheromone gland, we should be able to reopen the mine in—"
"115740052-0-46448";"Our strength wanes, wanderer. Hear us."
"115740052-0-46449";"Reopen the mine? After the Consortium left us to die? To Sovngarde with this mine. You've got the Queen's gland. Re-queen the mine yourself. We're leaving!"
"115740052-0-46450";"Ulfengar, please reconsider …. Ulfengar?"
"115740052-0-46451";"That's on the Consortium. Not us!"
"115740052-0-46452";"Friend, can you please talk to the overseer? The people of Necrom will starve without this mine!"
"115740052-0-46453";"You're back! I was worried maybe you abandoned me."
"115740052-0-46454";"SFX"
"115740052-0-46455";"Where is that s'wit? Doesn't she know how inconvenient this is?"
"115740052-0-46456";"Where is it …? Oh, there. That gong. Ring it."
"115740052-0-46457";"She has to come see why it sounded. Ring it and I'll introduce Luaffyn to my blades."
"115740052-0-46458";"Overseer Ulfengar, I cannot thank you enough for your decision to stay with the mine. I'll make sure the Consortium looks out for you. You have my word!"
"115740052-0-46459";"Good. You can start by making sure the families of those lost in the mine are properly taken care of."
"115740052-0-46460";"Of course. Honoring those lost is the first step towards making things right. The first of many!"
"115740052-0-46461";"I respect your decision to leave, overseer. But please, stay near Necrom for a few days at least. I want to make sure the Consortium compensates you for what you've endured."
"115740052-0-46462";"And … thank you for saving us, even when you were in over your head."
"115740052-0-46463";"Of course, overseer. I'll make sure you and the others get the support you need."
"115740052-0-46464";"Over here, friend. A rarely-used trapdoor."
"115740052-0-46466";"You go first."
"115740052-0-46467";"Those censers! Whatever they're emitting reeks!"
"115740052-0-46468";"Destroy the censers! They're sickening these keepers!"
"115740052-0-46469";"That's all of them. Let's go check on Abbot Ilvel."
"115740052-0-46470";"You stilled these scribe's pens with skill and speed. This one is glad to have you on his side."
"115740052-0-46471";"The hall, bask in its magnificence— shh! That's Valinna!"
"115740052-0-46472";"I need that staff. Lock the gates, Riftmaster. No one leaves until I find it."
"115740052-0-46473";"No one has ever challenged me and lived, Magnastylus."
"115740052-0-46476";"She has them calling her Magnastylus? No matter, the staff remains hidden. Our efforts may yet be successful."
"115740052-0-46477";"Five-claw! We are all important dignitaries, yes? Lady Arabelle is waiting for you inside Memorial Hall."
"115740052-0-46478";"A sample of my vestige for each stone. This unlocks the way."
"115740052-0-46479";"We discovered much here and gained a valuable ally, even though Master Shelreni took possession of the Black Book."
"115740052-0-46480";"I came as soon as I heard, proxy. I knew what Hermaeus Mora predicted, but I never truly imagined invaders in Apocrypha."
"115740052-0-46481";"The abbot! Destroy that foul censer, friend!"
"115740052-0-46483";"No … prelate, stop. Fulcrum Obscura? Durdryn's tomb … in the lower catacombs."
"115740052-0-46484";"Poor Abbot Ilvel, he's delirious! What did he say about the lower catacombs?"
"115740052-0-46485";"Cut it out Vorm, or I'm going to slap the pages out of you!"
"115740052-0-46486";"The door to the catacombs is through the chapel and to the north. Prior Durdryn's tomb is deep inside."
"115740052-0-46487";"The time to hide is over. Behold Blightcrown, most favored priest of Peryite! I leave you with a blessing from the Prince of Pestilence!"
"115740052-0-46488";"The relic broke! Still, this portion contains the power we need. I leave our guests to you, Blightcrown."
"115740052-0-46489";"We should first visit the Calamitous Gallery. Come this way."
"115740052-0-46490";"He didn't even make it past the Main Hall this time. Pitiful. And it seems he has dragged a newcomer along as well. Poor soul."
"115740052-0-46491";"Meet me in the Calamitous Gallery. It's this way!"
"115740052-0-46492";"You're back! Look! Abbot Ilvel is awake and feeling much better."
"115740052-0-46493";"Is this the one, Gadayn? You saved many lives, friend. Come, talk with me."
"115740052-0-46494";"Gadayn, go with this adventurer. Retrieve the stolen piece of Fulcrum Obscura. You need to see more of the world, anyway."
"115740052-0-46495";"Go? But … yes, abbot. I'll do it. Friend, a word please?"
"115740052-0-46501";"Tread carefully. The Calamitous Gallery has grown unruly as of late. It's become nearly as dangerous as its prophecies."
"115740052-0-46502";"Mother always said I was good at making friends! Wait, where are you going, Vorm?"
"115740052-0-46503";"We made it! We just have to place the book back in its proper spot and— Wait, what's that? I've never seen that in here before."
"115740052-0-46504";"Everything seems to be so angry at me. Did I do something wrong?"
"115740052-0-46505";"Struck down once again. Though, he did mention that something seemed different. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-46506";"It's almost as though someone is eliminating these books the moment you find them. At least you recovered something."
"115740052-0-46507";"What a mess! You really let the place go, Vorm."
"115740052-0-46508";"I think we should split up and shout for one another if we find something!"
"115740052-0-46509";"If the map guides you to my adventure novels, Vorm's dusty science books, and our dear mom's favorite histories, you'll know we're on the right track."
"115740052-0-46510";"The new cipher revealed he was sent here on a secret mission by our fathomless Prince and that he needs my help. I can't believe it. I'd do anything for my master."
"115740052-0-46512";"Why has the realm turned against us?"
"115740052-0-46513";"Apocrypha reels in pain and I feel it, too …."
"115740052-0-46514";"I don't sense the Great Eye's gaze. Has Hermaeus Mora abandoned us?"
"115740052-0-46515";"I do not recognize that pendant's sigil. Moreover, ciphers are not permitted personal trinkets while within the Cloisters."
"115740052-0-46516";"Fabric? Torn from a robe perhaps. Though not from one worn by the ciphers here in the Cloisters."
"115740052-0-46517";"Strange. Are those footsteps leading to the bookshelf? Wait, no, they seem to pass right through it."
"115740052-0-46518";"Another failed body. I will be free!"
"115740052-0-46519";"Do you feel the pull? The spiraling loop of the cycle. Delve deeper if you wish to resolve its unending trial."
"115740052-0-46520";"All right, friend! We'll meet you on the other side!"
"115740052-0-46522";"Don't know how my brother gets anything done in here. Nearly lost my finger to some biting satire back there!"
"115740052-0-46523";"This looks promising. Oh! I'd recognize that spine anywhere! Now how are we supposed to get to it?"
"115740052-0-46524";"Across the room!"
"115740052-0-46525";"I might have just the thing—here! Shouldn't be too dangerous, right? That's quite frosty out of its case!"
"115740052-0-46526";"Master Shelreni, the tower's defenses continue to oppose us."
"115740052-0-46527";"Meln was thorough, I'll give him that. Any word from the tower?"
"115740052-0-46528";"See that you do, captain. You there, come forward. You aren't with the Dusksabers."
"115740052-0-46529";"That Telvanni bears watching, but the tower remains the crux of our investigation here. Let us find a way in."
"115740052-0-46532";"Another afflicted. The corruption grows worse with every passing moment."
"115740052-0-46534";"Terrible dreams … terrible pain!"
"115740052-0-46535";"There you are! I was worried you changed your mind. Come now, we've got books to return!"
"115740052-0-46536";"There he goes. Again. Keep an eye open for any new details that may reveal the identity of this mystery cipher."
"115740052-0-46537";"It's like a plague, spreading across the realm of fate!"
"115740052-0-46538";"Why doesn't the Great Eye do something?"
"115740052-0-46539";"A mysterious cipher? How intriguing. Traveler, use this portal to return to the Main Hall. I'll meet you there shortly."
"115740052-0-46541";"Ah yes, right here. Just need to return the book back to the correct place. Wait, a moment. Traveler, something is wrong here—"
"115740052-0-46542";"I find comfort in Loggia Infinitum's vastness. Our Prince's knowledge is as infinite as he is caring. To walk these halls is to be held by him."
"115740052-0-46543";"Do be careful. Every tome here is priceless, I assure you."
"115740052-0-46544";"Huzmargo will start with these manuals. You will check the other tomes, yes? Look for anything on vessel disturbances."
"115740052-0-46545";"The creatures that serve our master, they attack for no reason!"
"115740052-0-46547";"I believe you are starting to understand what I have endured for countless cycles. Return the Encyclopedia Praedictionem to its pedestal and see what the sigil will reveal to us."
"115740052-0-46548";"Ugh, those autobiographies sure were full of themselves, weren't they Vorm?"
"115740052-0-46549";"Brave Barzuso truly relishes a fight against deadly amphibians, but it's time to come home."
"115740052-0-46550";"A magical ward seals that door. What happened here, mercenary?"
"115740052-0-46551";"What happened here? That ward killed my comrade. Not easy to do to a Dusksaber."
"115740052-0-46554";"Lenses such as that can reveal hidden things. Look through it, proxy."
"115740052-0-46555";"The Sigil of the Great Eye! So this is a trap of Mora's making. Quickly traveler, investigate what the eye has revealed."
"115740052-0-46556";"Look for anything glowing. That should be the switch to dispel the ward."
"115740052-0-46557";"More projections? I was certain returning this book would end the cycle."
"115740052-0-46558";"The cycle churns ever forward until all that was stolen is returned."
"115740052-0-46559";"The ward is gone! Master Shelreni must be informed at once!"
"115740052-0-46560";"This is our opportunity. Lead the way, proxy."
"115740052-0-46562";"I must consult the web of truth. Alert me with any news of the staff or the old fool."
"115740052-0-46563";"No need to involve you, Magnastylus. I'll beat anyone who tries to get through here."
"115740052-0-46564";"Naqri guards the rifts due to his more … aggressive nature. There'll be no reasoning with him."
"115740052-0-46568";"I suppose I just need to hold the relic out like so …."
"115740052-0-46569";"What an odd sensation."
"115740052-0-46570";"It worked! Look how it glows!"
"115740052-0-46571";"Give me a moment to focus the Fulcrum Obscura …."
"115740052-0-46572";"It … it almost feels alive in my hand …."
"115740052-0-46573";"The cairn is glowing! We did it!"
"115740052-0-46574";"Dust applied. Now to use the relic …."
"115740052-0-46575";"Oh my! It wriggled in my hand!"
"115740052-0-46576";"All done! Let's return to Leramil's study and let her know she can proceed."
"115740052-0-46578";"I feel the ebb and flow of Apocrypha … some guide me … others try to …."
"115740052-0-46579";"Oh Leramil, do be careful!"
"115740052-0-46580";"I told you. Apocrypha doesn't give up its secrets without a price."
"115740052-0-46581";"Got it!"
"115740052-0-46583";"Another choral mind awakening! But that voice …. Quickly, reset the focus. I have an idea."
"115740052-0-46584";"I will get out!"
"115740052-0-46586";"I think I understand what's going on. We should speak, adventurer."
"115740052-0-46587";"I cannot believe it! My father traded his life for mine!"
"115740052-0-46588";"That's my father's handwriting. And someone else's as well. What does it mean?"
"115740052-0-46589";"My father treasured this locket. He wore it on every voyage for good luck. He would never leave it behind. But it is marked with the symbol of Herm'us Mora. I never noticed that before."
"115740052-0-46590";"He's spirited to say the least, but he'll grow on you. Or not. He comes back either way."
"115740052-0-46591";"These are simple enough seals. Strange that the cipher couldn't undo these himself. No matter, I'm happy to help my Prince."
"115740052-0-46592";"So Meenai-Shai is the one undoing the seals on these tomes. What is this fool up to?"
"115740052-0-46593";"An idol of some sort? Though, I'm not sure why someone would worship a rat."
"115740052-0-46594";"It seems I had a chance to stop him, but acted too slowly. Is this my fault? Onto the last book, traveler. Let us end this."
"115740052-0-46595";"Prepare yourself for the majesty of the Empyrean Ascent—the summit of the Cloisters' collections!"
"115740052-0-46596";"The sigil has revealed more projections. Including one of myself. Interesting."
"115740052-0-46600";"But we still haven't recovered the other half of the Fulcrum Obscura!"
"115740052-0-46601";"Listen to Leramil, mortal. Your mind would melt the moment you stepped into the Infinite Panopticon."
"115740052-0-46602";"I … but … oh, very well. I'll return to Necrom and see if I can learn anything more about the Hidden Kindred or Master Shelreni. Do be careful, my friends."
"115740052-0-46603";"Let's not dawdle, Traveler. It seems I actually only have one book to return."
"115740052-0-46604";"With the final book returned, we should finally get the answers we seek."
"115740052-0-46605";"This isn't what I meant when I said you needed to grow a spine, Vorm."
"115740052-0-46606";"Now this looks like someplace mother would love. Minus the beasties of course. Though I suppose we were her beasties way back when."
"115740052-0-46607";"They're all very hostile, aren't they? I'm prone to a short temper myself when a book isn't returned properly."
"115740052-0-46608";"Naqri always was too arrogant."
"115740052-0-46609";"Thank you, Traveler. Now all that is left is to return the book. Wait, this looks odd. I've not seen this in here before."
"115740052-0-46610";"Let's take a look around. I can't quite remember her favorite, but I'll know it if I see it!"
"115740052-0-46611";"Web of truth? What could Valinna mean? No matter, we must retrieve the Itinerant Staff."
"115740052-0-46612";"You should have the honor. Not that I could return the final book myself."
"115740052-0-46613";"A book about Fargrave? Give that a toss. Mother could probably tell us more stories about it than any one book. It was her home after all."
"115740052-0-46614";"That sounds pretty dry, doesn't it? Mother loved old civilizations, but the Ayleids were a tad blasé, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-46615";"Hey, that sounds familiar! Yeah, I remember now. Mother would read these stories to us as kids. Even swapped out the names for ours."
"115740052-0-46616";"You dare enter the tower of Meln, magister of the Telvanni? Turn back or be destroyed!"
"115740052-0-46617";"The Deadlands rift is near. Do you see its influence on the walls around us?"
"115740052-0-46618";"A spirit? Ignore it and keep going, proxy."
"115740052-0-46619";"I have collected all the books our master requested! I do hope this pleases him!"
"115740052-0-46620";"Looks like Vorm is ready to leave! Meet us outside with those books when you finish up in here, all right?"
"115740052-0-46621";"Meenai-Shai can't possibly know about the Divinatory Forums. What is he doing here? And who is that cipher?"
"115740052-0-46622";"You aid that thief and liar, Shelreni Baro? Provoke me at your own risk, intruder!"
"115740052-0-46623";"Interesting. The spirit seems aware of Master Shelreni's attempt to access the tower."
"115740052-0-46624";"As if murdering me wasn't insult enough, now she sends you to steal my book?"
"115740052-0-46625";"Is this spirit actually Meln the Mouthless? Perhaps he is the thread that led us here."
"115740052-0-46626";"Quick, cipher. These tomes need to be brought up to the Divinatory Forums. Your master commands it."
"115740052-0-46627";"A cipher deceived into welcoming in vermin, and all under the nose of a blind observer."
"115740052-0-46628";"The Great Eye speaks harsh truths, but he is right. Come and speak with me."
"115740052-0-46629";"By all the tomes of Apocrypha, we found the entrance to the Infinite Panopticon!"
"115740052-0-46630";"Prepare to face the fury of Meln the Mouthless, magister of the Telvanni!"
"115740052-0-46631";"A reasonable request. Speak to the spirit, proxy."
"115740052-0-46632";"The rift. Kra! Of course the gate is shut."
"115740052-0-46633";"The thread becomes clear. Hermaeus Mora sent us to recover the Black Book."
"115740052-0-46634";"The Black Book is mine! And with this soul gem, I also have this miserable spirit. Meln comes with me!"
"115740052-0-46635";"And I thought this day couldn't get any worse."
"115740052-0-46636";"I knew a Telvanni master would be formidable. Come, proxy, we have plans to make."
"115740052-0-46637";"And listen, don't mention me to Harn. It probably won't do you any favors."
"115740052-0-46638";"You made it! Here, bring those books over. I think Vorm has a plan!"
"115740052-0-46639";"All right, brother. I'm just going to lay these out. The rest is up to you!"
"115740052-0-46640";"I recognize this, Father's spyglass! But its lens is cracked and useless."
"115740052-0-46641";"It worked! Let us continue into the Divinatory Forums."
"115740052-0-46643";"You! Traveler! Over here!"
"115740052-0-46644";"Keshargo? Submit or die!"
"115740052-0-46645";"There, that pedestal! Return the Atlas to its protective ward."
"115740052-0-46646";"Magnastylus? Sama-Rei, stop!"
"115740052-0-46647";"Loyal Mazandi. Help secure the Itinerant Staff. Zilipif knows the way."
"115740052-0-46648";"Valinna lied about your death? I'll find that staff before she does."
"115740052-0-46650";"This one will be in his study when you return."
"115740052-0-46652";"Of course. A fourth book, and one more potent than the rest. We must return it, Traveler, and stop this intruder at all costs."
"115740052-0-46653";"No treasure is worth this! I never should've come to Blackwood!"
"115740052-0-46654";"The Atlas Obscurum? Of course this triggered Mora's trap. My Prince would never risk this tome leaving the Cloisters. Quickly, we must return it."
"115740052-0-46655";"There, by the Divining Overlook. That is where we must return the Atlas. I'll meet you in there after I ascertain the extent of the cult's damage."
"115740052-0-46656";"G'uub! Those mortals were already dead when you got here, right?"
"115740052-0-46657";"Vorm! Quite the mess you got yourself into!"
"115740052-0-46659";"Books don't need to breathe, but it sure feels good to breathe again."
"115740052-0-46660";"My master wants you to convey this message to Master Shelreni. The assembly will not tolerate threats or coercion."
"115740052-0-46661";"Hey, what happened to the books? I was going to read Blackscale again!"
"115740052-0-46662";"Blackscale? That garbage is printed en masse. Planar Formulae was one of a kind!"
"115740052-0-46665";"Oh no, what a loss that is! It's good to have you back, brother."
"115740052-0-46666";"And it's good to see you too, sister. Thank you, and thanks to our new friend as well!"
"115740052-0-46667";"These rumors disturb the other masters. Shelreni must moderate her ambition before the assembly takes action."
"115740052-0-46668";"I will relay your concerns to Master Shelreni."
"115740052-0-46669";"We have entered the Infinite Panopticon, but where are the catalogers?"
"115740052-0-46670";"Careful, proxy. I sense corruption in the air."
"115740052-0-46671";"None escape my eye nor my judgment. Deceiver and deceived alike."
"115740052-0-46672";"Strange. I had forgotten the smell of dusty divinations. In fact, I can't remember the last book I read. It's been ages since I could pick one up."
"115740052-0-46673";"With knowledge secured and lesson learned, the cycle is broken. The faithful are made whole."
"115740052-0-46674";"The books! They're trying to steal— Wait. Is it over? Were the books returned?"
"115740052-0-46675";"Wait, you're no cipher. I won't allow you to steal these books. I won't!"
"115740052-0-46676";"Meenai-Shai, wait! We can't allow him access to the Atlas!"
"115740052-0-46677";"The Divinatory Forums are at my fingertips, master Peryite! All that is left is to steal the Atlas!"
"115740052-0-46682";"Hermaeus Mora has set a Guardian Gaze to protect the way ahead."
"115740052-0-46684";"We must divert its attention to cross the chamber."
"115740052-0-46686";"See how the Fulcrum vibrates? What we seek is here."
"115740052-0-46689";"Ah, fate's mortals. I have no wish to harm you. Turn back and let us finish what we started."
"115740052-0-46690";"They dare enter one of Hermaeus Mora's forbidden memories? We must follow them!"
"115740052-0-46693";"Another portal? I knew it! Blightcrown's manipulation of the layers of reality caused Leramil's spell to splinter. Well, step on through and hopefully we'll reach the layer we're looking for."
"115740052-0-46695";"This is it, Traveler. The moment the cycle was triggered, trapping us here."
"115740052-0-46696";"Hands off or I will gut you like the rest!"
"115740052-0-46699";"Face it, Brelynn. Luck's just not with you today."
"115740052-0-46700";"Shut it, Frall."
"115740052-0-46701";"Know when to quit, lady."
"115740052-0-46702";"That odious, oily bastard! I wish someone would claw out his other eye!"
"115740052-0-46707";"Try Cortin's Astounding Cordial. Guaranteed to restore energy, sharpen your mind, help your eyesight, and more!"
"115740052-0-46710";"I have no time for obstinate ghosts. You will give me access to the Black Book when I return—or else!"
"115740052-0-46712";"I need more time. Please! The cordial will catch on, I promise!"
"115740052-0-46713";"Over here! Quickly, before Shelreni comes back!"
"115740052-0-46716";"Be quick about it. Meet me at the tavern when you're done."
"115740052-0-46717";"Can you hear me? With the gem in your possession, I can come and go as I please. Now use that portal and let's go."
"115740052-0-46719";"Hmm. Come, proxy. I deciphered the letter."
"115740052-0-46720";"Taro isn't the brightest of atronachs, but he does love to splash."
"115740052-0-46721";"Is it just me or is it … frolicking?"
"115740052-0-46722";"Yes, this will do nicely. Let's discuss our arrangement, my chariot of flesh and bone."
"115740052-0-46723";"What in Oblivion is that doing here?"
"115740052-0-46724";"I won't let you do this, fate-forger!"
"115740052-0-46725";"It is already done. You will forget this ever happened. Everyone will. It is the only way to preserve reality."
"115740052-0-46726";"Damn you, Mora! Damn—no!"
"115740052-0-46729";"We're in a memory of Hermaeus Mora, mortal. Here, no harm may befall us. I suggest we use this opportunity to confer."
"115740052-0-46731";"Flee while you can, transgressor! Your reckless actions threaten all of reality!"
"115740052-0-46732";"Who dares enter this forbidden memory? No! What have you done?"
"115740052-0-46733";"This memory has changed. Chosen, speak with me."
"115740052-0-46735";"Hey. Told you I'd find you."
"115740052-0-46736";"Blegh, rotmeth! Makes me wish I was born without nostrils. Can't understand how anyone drinks the stuff."
"115740052-0-46737";"Is this Deredrien's place? Seems like a wanted woman, whoever she is."
"115740052-0-46738";"Looks like debt collection notices. Not helpful to us."
"115740052-0-46739";"Landolvel, my boy! You're alive! I'm so relieved!"
"115740052-0-46740";"Let me tell you all, my friend. Then you can cast the items into the flames and complete my pact."
"115740052-0-46741";"Hear me, Herm'us Mora! I accept your offer! My memories for my father's life!"
"115740052-0-46742";"You've heard what I have to say. Now, place the sacrifices into the flame."
"115740052-0-46743";"Hear me, Herm'us Mora! My liege, seal our pact for eternity. We rebuke your other offer."
"115740052-0-46744";"You have saved both me and my son, but at what cost?"
"115740052-0-46745";"One goes to the Calamitous Gallery, another to the Loggia Infinitum, and the last goes to the Empyrean Ascent."
"115740052-0-46746";"This way, proxy."
"115740052-0-46747";"The entrance is just up ahead. I'll meet you inside."
"115740052-0-46748";"The first life I took. A scrawny beast loved by the child next door. Seeing the boy cry made me smile."
"115740052-0-46749";"I offered the shelter of my basement to wandering souls only to take their lives while they slept."
"115740052-0-46750";"My father's knife. A handle carved from an antler. A blade sharp enough to cut bone. An artist never had a brush so delicate."
"115740052-0-46751";"Can you hear Huzmargo, friend? Huzmargo isolated the rogue mind's vessel! You should be able to dispatch him now!"
"115740052-0-46754";"This is a disaster. A disaster! We're losing centuries of work!"
"115740052-0-46755";"You've returned! I was worried the Lurkers got you."
"115740052-0-46756";"You did it! I see no trace of the Daggerfall Devil in the registry. Now quickly, adventurer, return to your body!"
"115740052-0-46758";"There! The Opulent Gale! Is my father there?"
"115740052-0-46759";"Father, is that you? Are you…this ghost?"
"115740052-0-46760";"I would rather perish than let my son forget me. Let me seal the pact."
"115740052-0-46762";"The logbook! Why didn't it burn? I don't understand."
"115740052-0-46765";"You belong to the Sul-Xan now, filthy beast."
"115740052-0-46766";"Zilipif said the staff is in a bone box … a sarcophagus? That must be where Keshargo hid it!"
"115740052-0-46767";"Welcome back, adventurer. I hope your time in the chorus wasn't too disorienting. Let's talk outside."
"115740052-0-46768";"The poor dear is exhausted. They must have truly tormented her. Thalias abhors violence."
"115740052-0-46769";"Ah, mortal. Hello? Over here."
"115740052-0-46770";"What is it doing? Protecting the sarcophagus?"
"115740052-0-46771";"I reckon we won't be able to get through this without a fight. Get ready."
"115740052-0-46772";"I … I don't know anything about a fulcrum. Please …."
"115740052-0-46773";"No … I know nothing of Prior Durdryn's tomb … leave me be …."
"115740052-0-46774";"Gadayn? Abbot Ilvel is in danger! Prelate Faram put one of those foul censers in his chamber."
"115740052-0-46775";"The tides of fate turn and your part in this story is not yet ended."
"115740052-0-46776";"There you are. I was afraid you might have been lost in the Void after my portal fractured."
"115740052-0-46777";"When all this is over, I'll apologize for acting in another realm. But we really need that staff."
"115740052-0-46778";"Look! Someone left a trail. Crouch down and you'll see it."
"115740052-0-46782";"Ooh! There it is. All right, time to figure out how this works and return to Scrivener's Hall."
"115740052-0-46783";"The mortal returns. I thought I recognized that wrinkle in the fabric of fate."
"115740052-0-46784";"Hmm, I hoped Leramil would be with you. We have news!"
"115740052-0-46787";"Wait. What are these subjects doing out of containment?"
"115740052-0-46789";"No more dreams … no more nightmares …."
"115740052-0-46790";"Curate or not, he'll never get into the conclave bearing the mark of a Daedric Prince. Not without my help."
"115740052-0-46792";"There! Are those research notes?"
"115740052-0-46793";"No, stay back! I need to wake up! I have to!"
"115740052-0-46794";"Look around. Maybe there's something here that explains what happened."
"115740052-0-46795";"Tun-Shei? Thank the Eight you're all right!"
"115740052-0-46796";"Scourge! I've waited a lifetime for you."
"115740052-0-46797";"Your rampage ends now!"
"115740052-0-46798";"Fate needs you, proxy."
"115740052-0-46799";"Time weaves all around us."
"115740052-0-46800";"And I can tear it asunder!"
"115740052-0-46801";"Time is so fragile."
"115740052-0-46802";"So easy to shred!"
"115740052-0-46803";"Wait, do you feel that? It's like we're being watched …."
"115740052-0-46804";"What a horrible noise you mortals make. Where's it coming from?"
"115740052-0-46805";"Creatures of the past obey my will!"
"115740052-0-46807";"Do you see now? My power has no limit."
"115740052-0-46808";"I've tolerated this incursion long enough."
"115740052-0-46809";"Your future arrives early!"
"115740052-0-46810";"Now you see how I control your fate."
"115740052-0-46811";"I exist in all of time!"
"115740052-0-46813";"Dacia—stay back! I tried to escape, but she was right. My mother was right about everything!"
"115740052-0-46814";"Nathyn … what are you talking about? We're here to rescue you!"
"115740052-0-46815";"Nightmares. Sounds like Prince Vaermina, all right. We should investigate this Green Glass Inn."
"115740052-0-46816";"So now you know the truth."
"115740052-0-46817";"The key is in that chest. It's a spare for when the researchers misplace theirs."
"115740052-0-46818";"Why are they like this? What has Sathile done to them?"
"115740052-0-46819";"No. The observation outpost! What happened? Where is everyone?"
"115740052-0-46820";"The researchers too? Gods, what has she done?"
"115740052-0-46822";"You cannot fight the danger that lies ahead. This is your last chance."
"115740052-0-46823";"Dacia, turn back, or you may never leave this tower again!"
"115740052-0-46824";"Maybe Reynila and the one she's with sneaked through instead of fighting? Can't imagine a fight going well for them."
"115740052-0-46825";"Know … your place. Beast."
"115740052-0-46826";"Ooh! An Infernium. I've never seen one so close."
"115740052-0-46827";"Kaj-kujei? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-46828";"Sharp, please. Help her."
"115740052-0-46829";"What did you just call me?"
"115740052-0-46831";"Reynila? Stay with me, love. Please. Reynila?"
"115740052-0-46833";"The Dreamcarvers plan to strike at Apocrypha? That must be the disturbance in fate that brought me here."
"115740052-0-46834";"Master Shelreni? Are you familiar with this mortal?"
"115740052-0-46835";"Dimik-ei, Reynila got you this far. I'll take you the rest of the way. And then I'm never coming back to Morrowind."
"115740052-0-46836";"Where are you taking her?"
"115740052-0-46837";"You've made your path clear, Sharp. If you fail at taking out the Reformer and fall under his control again, it's better if you don't know."
"115740052-0-46838";"Sharp, please come with us. You don't have to be alone."
"115740052-0-46839";"I'm not going to be alone. And I'm not going to fail."
"115740052-0-46840";"I won't let you take her back!"
"115740052-0-46841";"They've got her cornered. Hey, fetchers! Looking for me?"
"115740052-0-46842";"Sharp? Help us, please!"
"115740052-0-46843";"Reynila went through that door. She looked hurt. Bad."
"115740052-0-46844";"Hezehk will never pay off the debt now."
"115740052-0-46845";"Ahh, the Glyphic Assemblage. This is where fated glyphics are collected and judged by Watchlings such as myself."
"115740052-0-46846";"Try to avoid eye contact as we continue through the Underweave. Not all its attendants are as polite as I am."
"115740052-0-46848";"Wait. Those lanterns …. This is Reynila's signal? I think I've seen it before."
"115740052-0-46849";"Well, if it isn't my flower f'lah."
"115740052-0-46850";"An arched gateway. It's inactive, but I can detect the lingering energy of Apocrypha in the air. It must have closed recently."
"115740052-0-46851";"Wait. Where's Keshargo?"
"115740052-0-46852";"<Urgent alien beckoning.>"
"115740052-0-46853";"Zilipif slow down, I don't under— Keshargo's in trouble? Take us to him, now!"
"115740052-0-46855";"Ready yourself, mortal. Now what was that invocation? Ah. By Seventh Umbra and the Dismal Name, I bid thee open, Cephaliarch's fane!"
"115740052-0-46856";"Audiences love to watch Roki ignite other creatures, but he should save it for our shows."
"115740052-0-46857";"Come on, Sharp. I've been good to you, haven't I? If you can't find something nice, at least make sure it's warm."
"115740052-0-46858";"Sharp? Sharp! What are you doing here?!"
"115740052-0-46860";"Keshargo swears the Itinerant Staff lies in the Spiral Skein!"
"115740052-0-46861";"She didn't tell me? Nevertheless, you really are a fool."
"115740052-0-46862";"Well, look who it is. Federo. I thought one of your mercs took you out."
"115740052-0-46863";"Hello? Who's there? Please don't be another bear!"
"115740052-0-46865";"Well, that was a waste of time!"
"115740052-0-46866";"Good luck, outsider. You're going to need it."
"115740052-0-46867";"What? No, no, no, this can't be right! There are so many paths! Why are there so many paths?"
"115740052-0-46868";"We're doomed! I'm doomed! We can't possibly find my master's glyphic now!"
"115740052-0-46869";"You're staying? Truly? Are you sure, Dacia?"
"115740052-0-46870";"I fought this hard just to get to you, Nathyn. Of course I'm staying."
"115740052-0-46871";"Dacia … I love you. I'm glad you're going to see the world."
"115740052-0-46872";"Nathyn, until you can see it with me, my road will always lead back to Tel Dreloth."
"115740052-0-46873";"New clothes? You're shameless."
"115740052-0-46874";"<Worried alien noises.>"
"115740052-0-46875";"Two deer ran right through the camp after you left! I made all haste to get here after that."
"115740052-0-46876";"Two? Deer? I'm surprised you survived."
"115740052-0-46877";"Zilipif, you freeze up around spiders. Stay here. We'll bring Keshargo back."
"115740052-0-46878";"Behold, Apocrypha. Don't look up, mortal. I understand your kind find our sky disturbing. Let me see … head south! They went that way."
"115740052-0-46880";"Poor Watcher. The invaders can't be too far ahead. Husk hasn't dissipated yet. The trail continues to the west, mortal."
"115740052-0-46881";"Alavelissians, mortal. The contradiction they were compelled to create hangs heavy in the air. The trail continues west."
"115740052-0-46882";"The trail leads directly to the Tranquil Catalog. Oh no! Pick up the pace, mortal."
"115740052-0-46886";"I serve Mephala. Once the staff is mine, so will everyone else."
"115740052-0-46889";"Fate needs you, proxy."
"115740052-0-46890";"Fate needs you, proxy."
"115740052-0-46891";"Doesn't get cheaper than free. Let's take a look."
"115740052-0-46892";"Through the rift. We have to help Keshargo!"
"115740052-0-46894";"You turned your back on Hermorah."
"115740052-0-46895";"He is weak. Words and drawings change nothing!"
"115740052-0-46896";"Clothing here! Free to anyone who can take it off my hands!"
"115740052-0-46897";"Blegh! You carry that. I'll try to keep upwind of you."
"115740052-0-46898";"Sharp, how could you of all people have picked clothes that smell this terrible?"
"115740052-0-46899";"Look, nothing will want to attack and eat you when you smell like that. Makes your new job a whole lot easier."
"115740052-0-46900";"Look for my mirror. And see if the Voidprowlers dropped anything."
"115740052-0-46901";"Invaders in the Tranquil Catalog? What a calamity."
"115740052-0-46902";"The way to the Pool of Inquiry is straight ahead."
"115740052-0-46903";"I was afraid of this. The invaders used the sacred tears. Look around. Without them, we can't use the pool."
"115740052-0-46904";"These portals lead to the shrines where we can find more of the sacred tears."
"115740052-0-46905";"My mirror! Is it broken?"
"115740052-0-46906";"Is that cloth? Yes, good. Useful."
"115740052-0-46907";"There they are, but Valinna blocked our path. We'll have to go the long way."
"115740052-0-46908";"For once, a pleasant surprise. I'm actually happy to see you, meddler. My work in the streams has come to fruition."
"115740052-0-46910";"You believe lies and deception do? Mafala is using your guilt against you."
"115740052-0-46911";"With the staff and her guidance, we won't have to watch idly while terrible things happen."
"115740052-0-46912";"Hands. I'm not jealous at all. Now take the tears and place them in the pool."
"115740052-0-46914";"Foves. I understand you have a spy in your employ."
"115740052-0-46915";"Master Sulis! It wasn't me!"
"115740052-0-46916";"Master Foves, it seems your aide has been speaking out of turn."
"115740052-0-46917";"No! Mercy, please!"
"115740052-0-46918";"See how the pool reveals our goal? The Tranquil Archives. Enter the pool and it will take us there."
"115740052-0-46919";"The Tranquil Archives. One of the main repositories for Hermaeus Mora's glyphics. We need to find the invaders, mortal."
"115740052-0-46921";"Dispatch the kynreeve swiftly, mortal. We must examine the glyphic Torvesard opened."
"115740052-0-46924";"Right. Nothing left to do but go inside."
"115740052-0-46927";"Hmm … no … this isn't right. Something's wrong here."
"115740052-0-46928";"But never mind that. There's more work ahead. Over here, if you please."
"115740052-0-46929";"One moment and I'll conjure up a portal."
"115740052-0-46930";"It appears we're in no immediate danger. We can speak here, mortal."
"115740052-0-46932";"Here's the bridge. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-46933";"One of the thieves! You talk to her. It could be a trick."
"115740052-0-46934";"Ah, great. Now you're here."
"115740052-0-46935";"Get inside. We're losing time."
"115740052-0-46936";"Well? Anything useful?"
"115740052-0-46938";"Now we find that secret! Hezehk will let you lead."
"115740052-0-46939";"No, no, no! It's too big. We need a plan. Talk with me."
"115740052-0-46940";"Watch for the Darkreaves. They hide in the dark. Naturally."
"115740052-0-46941";"Oh. The runt's here."
"115740052-0-46942";"That's him! He kicked me! Does he have the secret?"
"115740052-0-46943";"The secret isn't here. I've failed."
"115740052-0-46944";"Tomeshell feather, good. I hate those pests."
"115740052-0-46945";"That's the red kind, right? Perfect."
"115740052-0-46946";"That tip should be sharp enough."
"115740052-0-46947";"I hear the echo of a hall. Should be plenty of space for the spell. Meet Hezehk inside!"
"115740052-0-46948";"Perfect. My spell will cover a wide area here. Don't dawdle. Bring those reagents here."
"115740052-0-46949";"That's not it! I sense the secret is near though. Maybe. Follow the flare."
"115740052-0-46950";"No, that's not right. Hmm … I sense it getting closer, follow the flare."
"115740052-0-46951";"Once again, not it. You can do this, Hezehk. It has to be around here somewhere. Go to the next flare."
"115740052-0-46952";"I have a good feeling about this one. Grab it."
"115740052-0-46953";"Hang on, I'll come down to you."
"115740052-0-46954";"Such a troublesome secret. It better be a good one."
"115740052-0-46956";"Ridiculous. Meet me outside, mortal. I'm done here."
"115740052-0-46957";"I never want to see another book ever again."
"115740052-0-46958";"The place looks deserted, but I don't feel like we're alone. There's something here."
"115740052-0-46959";"What is this metal? When we came in here, I could almost … feel it."
"115740052-0-46960";"What the—?"
"115740052-0-46961";"Sharp? After all this time! Where are you? Who's that with you?"
"115740052-0-46962";"Stay back!"
"115740052-0-46963";"You touched the tyranite and I felt it, Sharp. I felt it! You're still attuned. Do you know what this means? Remember me. Remember us!"
"115740052-0-46964";"All I remember is wanting to kill you."
"115740052-0-46965";"That's right. And you're so close to being mine once more. Just a moment longer …."
"115740052-0-46966";"The metal—break the connection!"
"115740052-0-46967";"Hurry! The Lark can't be too far ahead."
"115740052-0-46969";"Valinna's pledged herself to Mephala and the Spiral Skein. Be careful."
"115740052-0-46970";"Ugh … I don't feel so good. Should have stayed in bed."
"115740052-0-46971";"Where's that layabout, Randas? Absent again?"
"115740052-0-46972";"You … lied? I will enjoy feeding you to the spiders."
"115740052-0-46973";"Walker, help. Please."
"115740052-0-46974";"Yes, I can feel the flow of magicka! Keep going!"
"115740052-0-46975";"Take note, adventurer. It takes an extremely skilled mage to effectively wield this magic."
"115740052-0-46976";"There! That's it!"
"115740052-0-46977";"Don't let him get away! Follow him! I just need to catch my breath. Meet me at the docks once you have his prism."
"115740052-0-46981";"It's not too late. We can leave without the staff."
"115740052-0-46982";"I've been found. Against all odds and protections. Come, we should talk."
"115740052-0-46984";"Kaj-kujei! And you brought your friend! Good."
"115740052-0-46985";"Ah, the staff. I don't need you anymore, Magnastylus. The Spinner provides."
"115740052-0-46986";"Look, when you say kaj-kujei …."
"115740052-0-46987";"I know—you don't remember being my brother. But what if I could make you remember?"
"115740052-0-46988";"Keshargo!"
"115740052-0-46989";"What are you talking about?"
"115740052-0-46990";"You're a strong mage and a good Scribe, Mazandi."
"115740052-0-46991";"We did it, Magnastylus. We have the Itinerant Staff and Valinna is … defeated."
"115740052-0-46992";"The cost was steep, but such is the price of ensuring the Scribes of Mora survived."
"115740052-0-46993";"Stop right there!"
"115740052-0-46995";"You've tricked me out of the talisman, but you'll never catch me alive!"
"115740052-0-46996";"Scoundrel! Thief! Pariah curse you and hound your steps for all your days!"
"115740052-0-46997";"Not a problem. Sit tight. We'll be back."
"115740052-0-46998";"Broken Tusk is home to cultists of Molag Bal. And worse, I've heard."
"115740052-0-46999";"Magnastylus, your Itinerant Staff."
"115740052-0-47000";"Keep it, Mazandi. That staff could not be in better hands. You are the one the scribes need to lead them."
"115740052-0-47001";"I—Kesh—Magna—sir, you honor me."
"115740052-0-47002";"Still, we must remove the source of the staff's power—the Umber Glyphic. A Magnastylus cannot be obsessed with a tool."
"115740052-0-47003";"Hidden directive activated. Dreaming …"
"115740052-0-47004";"Well, that was convincing. Where are the others?"
"115740052-0-47005";"It works. I knew it would, but combining Mnemonic Fragments in this way is complicated."
"115740052-0-47006";"What? How did you manage this? It seems I underestimated you."
"115740052-0-47007";"But I won't allow you to take the prism, I won't!"
"115740052-0-47008";"Wait. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-47009";"The metal's here. Close. It's strange, I can almost feel it."
"115740052-0-47010";"A Telvanni master. Speak with her, proxy."
"115740052-0-47011";"You will not give the talisman willingly? Face Shadeya's blades and suffer!"
"115740052-0-47012";"No! This one has risked too much to forfeit now!"
"115740052-0-47013";"I'll meet you in the underways."
"115740052-0-47014";"The walker has returned! A thousand blessings to you, savior of the Baandari."
"115740052-0-47015";"Armiger Rilasi, your efforts in returning this relic to our shrine will be noted."
"115740052-0-47016";"You're back!"
"115740052-0-47017";"No one around, just as I hoped. The chapel is through the doorway and up the stairs."
"115740052-0-47020";"Remember—it's just a test. A little starter memory."
"115740052-0-47022";"When you're ready, friend of Sharp, put your hand to the metal."
"115740052-0-47029";"Blightcrown is with the abbot? His chambers are to the north when we're done here."
"115740052-0-47030";"You … you charmed me?"
"115740052-0-47031";"If it's any consolation, Watchling, you performed your role admirably!"
"115740052-0-47032";"Now to the nemesis looms. It will take the two of us to disable each loom."
"115740052-0-47033";"My role? I didn't play any role in—hey! Get back here!"
"115740052-0-47034";"The Spiral Skein rift! That must be where Keshargo is."
"115740052-0-47035";"Told you we could handle ourselves. Did you miss us?"
"115740052-0-47037";"There you are. Disable that mechanism, and I'll do the same here. That should deactivate the loom."
"115740052-0-47038";"There is only one role I play, and it's in service to the Prince of Knowledge! How dare you imply otherwise!"
"115740052-0-47039";"Heh. Mora's clerk objects? I'm terrified. Come now, meddler. On to the next loom!"
"115740052-0-47040";"Ah. Another over-eager pupil seeking to profit from my efforts."
"115740052-0-47041";"I can already feel my presence solidifying. Come now, let's shut this one down as well."
"115740052-0-47042";"A clerk? A clerk? What a wild underestimation of my role!"
"115740052-0-47043";"On the contrary, I couldn't have done this without you. Onwards, the next loom is close by!"
"115740052-0-47044";"Could I instead interest you in some fungal tea? No?"
"115740052-0-47045";"I'm solid enough to regain my sense of smell! A dubious improvement. The next mechanism, please."
"115740052-0-47046";"My master's fated glyphic could be reduced to pitiful strands of temporal dust at any moment now!"
"115740052-0-47047";"Strands of dust? Unlikely. Well, perhaps, but that's nothing to worry about now. To the next loom!"
"115740052-0-47048";"A hunt it is. Adventurer, scour the island for glowing notes! Meet me in the middle of the estate once you have them."
"115740052-0-47049";"Excuse me? My continued existence depends on that glyphic! Come back here!"
"115740052-0-47051";"Good luck! By which I mean, I hope your deaths are painless! Mostly."
"115740052-0-47052";"This is it, the final loom! Quickly, disable the mechanism!"
"115740052-0-47053";"If my master's fated glyphic is destroyed, then what was the point of all this?"
"115740052-0-47055";"Worry not. With the looms disabled we need only check the Underweave's trash heap. Onwards, meddler!"
"115740052-0-47056";"The trash heap? Oh, tides take me away!"
"115740052-0-47057";"I've studied countless specimens, none are without flaws yet all achieve a sort of beauty."
"115740052-0-47058";"No, no, no! The fated glyphic! It's already been unwoven!"
"115740052-0-47059";"Not ideal? I'm doomed to be tormented forever! Eternal anguish!"
"115740052-0-47060";"Is that it? In order to create a form this pure, must I master the art of irregularities?"
"115740052-0-47061";"It took the creator a long time to differentiate mandatory flaws from those he could improve upon."
"115740052-0-47062";"Not ideal, but not unexpected. Meddler, a word if you please?"
"115740052-0-47064";"Good, you found us. Place the fractured glyphic on the altar. There's not a moment to lose."
"115740052-0-47065";"You think. You talk. You move and you have a name. What is missing?"
"115740052-0-47066";"You, Protus, have more purpose than half of all mortals. So why aren't you better than them?"
"115740052-0-47067";"Almost there … just a bit further … Quick! Grab the glyphic before the entropic bubble collapses!"
"115740052-0-47068";"Bending time really puts a kink in your neck. Let's reconvene outside Underweave. I'm sure this display of temporal magic raised a few alarms."
"115740052-0-47071";"Thaddeus, you must listen closely. The fate of the planes depends on it."
"115740052-0-47072";"So the rumors were true. Mora really did learn my fate."
"115740052-0-47073";"Don't talk over me! Understand that when the time comes, you must say no."
"115740052-0-47074";"I must say no? What in Oblivion am I talking about?"
"115740052-0-47075";"In my timeline, things didn't go exactly to plan. But I hope you'll glimpse this causality in enough time to change our fate."
"115740052-0-47076";"It seems the only person who can fix a Thaddeus Cosma mess is Thaddeus Cosma. How exciting!"
"115740052-0-47077";"My daughter's death hurt worse than this."
"115740052-0-47078";"No! We will not be defeated by the likes of you."
"115740052-0-47079";"I'll find you in your dreams. You'll never be safe!"
"115740052-0-47080";"Given time, your joints will wear down. Your precision footpads will dent and crumble."
"115740052-0-47081";"But, in this moment—and only this moment—you are perfection itself."
"115740052-0-47082";"Self-repair was the only way the Creator could circumvent inevitable deterioration."
"115740052-0-47083";"Locked? The chapel is never locked! Can you pick it? If not, Curate Zankan leaves his key on a shelf to the northwest."
"115740052-0-47084";"The Creator left before I could learn the answer to his question."
"115740052-0-47086";"Protus, you're active?"
"115740052-0-47087";"Halt Apostle. You won't reach the Probabilis."
"115740052-0-47088";"I will activate the Probabilis. It's what Seht wanted."
"115740052-0-47089";"Your hypothesis is incorrect. This will only result in catastrophic failure."
"115740052-0-47090";"We must stop him. Before his actions cause irreparable damage."
"115740052-0-47091";"You're too late. The Clockwork Probabilis is mine to control."
"115740052-0-47092";"The Probabilis is active. You think you can stop me now?"
"115740052-0-47093";"We arrived too late. Apostle Nilphas Drethan activated the Probabilis. Stop him before it makes a lasting change."
"115740052-0-47094";"What have you done? I was going to—"
"115740052-0-47095";"No luck on my end. Continue your search in the tower."
"115740052-0-47096";"Excellent progress. I sense it's deeper below ground. Keep searching."
"115740052-0-47097";"The matriarch arrived here from the past. It seems she forged a defensive pact with Peryite."
"115740052-0-47098";"No—! Get him!"
"115740052-0-47099";"Quit running away, and I'll do more than that!"
"115740052-0-47100";"Has it really been so long? Those components look terrible, but they'll have to do."
"115740052-0-47101";"That's my illusion tincture! The other components are buried elsewhere."
"115740052-0-47102";"We can work with this. Head toward my tower and let's find a workbench to assemble the spell."
"115740052-0-47103";"I remember this old workbench. We can prepare the cloak of omission here."
"115740052-0-47104";"Place the components, one at a time, onto the enchanting workbench."
"115740052-0-47121";"We can speak freely here."
"115740052-0-47127";"Master Shelreni, you stand accused of conspiring against your fellow Telvanni, murdering Meln the Mouthless, and consorting with Daedric Princes. How do you plead?"
"115740052-0-47128";"A Telvanni doesn't plead."
"115740052-0-47131";"You again? If these fools can't stop me, what hope do you have?"
"115740052-0-47132";"Help me, magister!"
"115740052-0-47133";"Shelreni! Cease your actions this instant!"
"115740052-0-47135";"You're finally awake! Thank the ancestors! I thought Shelreni killed you!"
"115740052-0-47136";"This ancient ruin … those markings … this place is dedicated to Vaermina!"
"115740052-0-47137";"This chamber appears promising. We should look around."
"115740052-0-47138";"Anything relevant in those papers?"
"115740052-0-47139";"You've returned! I'm glad to see those stories of untrustworthy mortals weren't all true."
"115740052-0-47140";"No! Now my disciple. Complete the sacrifice so I may inhabit the vessel!"
"115740052-0-47141";"Away agents of fate! This vessel will help me restore what was taken from us all!"
"115740052-0-47142";"Now, friend! Free Marena from the binding!"
"115740052-0-47143";"There's Shelreni! And Master Marena! We need to free her!"
"115740052-0-47145";"Shelreni's using the restored statue as a focus for her rite."
"115740052-0-47146";"That's a starflower bloom, right there."
"115740052-0-47147";"Daedric magic is unstable! Save yourselves!"
"115740052-0-47148";"Close my Black Book and take it! That should end the rite."
"115740052-0-47149";"No! Not when we're so close!"
"115740052-0-47150";"Taking the Black Book won't stop us. And one of you will serve just as well as a sacrifice."
"115740052-0-47151";"No need to involve outsiders, Shelreni."
"115740052-0-47153";"With this vessel, I can enter Apocrypha and strike at Mora's heart! With me, my faithful!"
"115740052-0-47155";"We have to warn Apocrypha! Let's return to the Necrom Bindery and find Leramil."
"115740052-0-47156";"I expected more activity in the mine but, oh. By the Green, what happened here?"
"115740052-0-47164";"Yes, mercenary, I'll hear what you have to say. The least I can do for helping save us."
"115740052-0-47165";"We have reached the lower level of the tower. There should be more portals to take us higher, proxy."
"115740052-0-47167";"They asked so many questions … please, help the others."
"115740052-0-47168";"Good. Now, let's find where we're headed."
"115740052-0-47171";"Somewhere in the Alik'r Desert it seems … oh. I see. Kozanset."
"115740052-0-47172";"Here we are … Kozanset. Let's get searching, eh cohort?"
"115740052-0-47173";"Hey, wait. Let's chat."
"115740052-0-47174";"All right. Set down the metal in the circle and let me concentrate."
"115740052-0-47176";"You sent for me, master?"
"115740052-0-47177";"There—a trap door. I can feel the calx, like I did before. This is it."
"115740052-0-47181";"Captured by a Dark Elf then freed by one. Do you think I'm just going to ignore—"
"115740052-0-47182";"I don't care what you do, as long as you don't mention my part in it."
"115740052-0-47185";"Then they die with you."
"115740052-0-47189";"We entered unseen. Come, let us plan."
"115740052-0-47190";"I say, you there! Spare a coin for a down-on-his-luck researcher?"
"115740052-0-47191";"There but for the power of Apocrypha go I! With many of my projects, success and disaster were decided by a handful of coins!"
"115740052-0-47194";"You there. Are you on walkabout as well? Tall Papa protect and keep you on your long journey!"
"115740052-0-47195";"Ugh! How can he be me? I'd never devote myself to a higher power … at least without seeking to surpass them in some way."
"115740052-0-47196";"Dralys led them right to us, like guar to the slaughter!"
"115740052-0-47197";"For the Dusksabers, my brother!"
"115740052-0-47198";"Save some of their blood for me, brother!"
"115740052-0-47202";"What in Oblivion? It's the fate we saw back at Fathoms Drift!"
"115740052-0-47203";"Ah, the Fulcrum Obscura—wait. Someone approaches, Torvesard. Quick, take the relic!"
"115740052-0-47205";"There's the Forgotten Crypts. With any luck, they'll have one more dead Dark Elf in them by the end of this."
"115740052-0-47206";"A torchbug? Quick—don't lose it!"
"115740052-0-47207";"Ah, Azandar. My counterpart. You sought to learn, but now you shall be replaced! Hahaha!"
"115740052-0-47208";"What are you?"
"115740052-0-47209";"I grow ever stronger. Your fates feed me. Soon, I shall surpass even you!"
"115740052-0-47210";"That thing wishes to … replace me, then? Most disconcerting. We should discuss this. Outside."
"115740052-0-47211";"Not since my first writ. The spirits of my victims fill the Necropolis and they can be quite nasty."
"115740052-0-47212";"Visit Necrom a lot, Ashur? You seem the sentimental type."
"115740052-0-47213";"You're just upset that you didn't think of it first."
"115740052-0-47214";"You consider the Necropolis to be a trophy case? That's rather unprofessional of you."
"115740052-0-47220";"Ah, here we are! Home sweet sanctum. Let's talk, cohort. Post-haste!"
"115740052-0-47221";"Spiffing! Just needs a little magicka to get going. Hold the stencil over the font just there, eh?"
"115740052-0-47222";"Peerless! Now, point it at Gubbins and gesticulate. Vigorously!"
"115740052-0-47223";"And down goes Gubbins. Rummage around in the goop, would you?"
"115740052-0-47224";"Hah, one arcane bobbin … damn! Well, nothing for it. The name's stuck. Let's just get on with this."
"115740052-0-47227";"Another one! Confounded thing!"
"115740052-0-47228";"Look who it is! Hey, friend, over here!"
"115740052-0-47229";"You have an intelligent look about you. A moment of your time?"
"115740052-0-47233";"By the blessed pox, the prior's tomb should be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-47234";"Keep looking! Blightcrown demands we find the relic!"
"115740052-0-47235";"So where are we off to first, boss? Hey, look who it is!"
"115740052-0-47236";"Begone! My fateline is my own."
"115740052-0-47238";"Did you hear …? Never mind. Welcome! This should be most illuminating!"
"115740052-0-47239";"Such a massive ritual! Destroy the focus."
"115740052-0-47241";"The glyphic will be ours, cultist scum!"
"115740052-0-47242";"All-Knowing Eye, protect us!"
"115740052-0-47243";"Tell me how to reach the glyphic, cultist fool!"
"115740052-0-47244";"I will never betray the Great Eye!"
"115740052-0-47246";"Mortal, why do you bear the mark of the Great Eye?"
"115740052-0-47247";"We light the flames to summon Tem, the Omen of Destiny. Come before us!"
"115740052-0-47249";"No hard feelings, friend, but I'm going to have to kill you."
"115740052-0-47251";"I have new patrons. Powerful patrons."
"115740052-0-47252";"Faithful, aid me!"
"115740052-0-47253";"I suppose I should have … foreseen this …."
"115740052-0-47254";"Facets of the ritual may tell us something. Look for clues."
"115740052-0-47256";"Recalcitrant, are we? We offer the talon of a Seeker. I need Martina to correct an error. Where are they?"
"115740052-0-47257";"Tem's eyes have seen you, Azandar al-Cybiades. You search for one who does not wish to be found."
"115740052-0-47258";"Daedra, I have called, and you must answer. With ichor as payment, I command you. Where can I find Martina Abor?"
"115740052-0-47259";"You tamper with fate, mortal. Tem sees a darkness approaching. One you have unmoored."
"115740052-0-47265";"Good, that should weaken the ritual."
"115740052-0-47266";"Let us keep searching."
"115740052-0-47267";"This must be it. Knock knock Martina!"
"115740052-0-47269";"A journal containing the wisdom of the first Remnant."
"115740052-0-47270";"That spyglass peers through the void to find new realms."
"115740052-0-47271";"That key itself is a lock, which another key then opens."
"115740052-0-47272";"You defeated my spider, but you will never best me."
"115740052-0-47275";"This distortion is a frayed fate. Let's pull this situation into focus."
"115740052-0-47279";"Swab the deck, Azandar. Stop lollygagging, Azandar … I'm tired of all this."
"115740052-0-47280";"Bilge rats and stale bread. I'll never make it to first mate."
"115740052-0-47283";"Ahhh. Such potential. Stronger now."
"115740052-0-47284";"I grow … stronger."
"115740052-0-47285";"Twitching tentacles, what is that?"
"115740052-0-47287";"Quickly! Use the key! These runeforms should banish that thing."
"115740052-0-47288";"We will not be undone!"
"115740052-0-47290";"Malachite, volcanic glass that absorbs magicka under the right conditions. A good choice for building a gateway to Oblivion."
"115740052-0-47291";"It's empty. You, Remnant! There's nothing here!"
"115740052-0-47292";"Some of the missing villagers. Mortals should have the decency not to leave their empty husks lying about. It's untidy."
"115740052-0-47293";"Scrutinary exploratum!"
"115740052-0-47294";"He is clever. But I am cleverer. This portal should lead us directly to him."
"115740052-0-47297";"Welcome, counterpart. It's here that we discovered the true potential of the fatelines. And I've returned to claim the device I needed."
"115740052-0-47298";"We both saw the power, the potential. The chance to claim the strength of your lessers. You rebuke our very nature!"
"115740052-0-47299";"I am the part of you that knows the true way to power. And we shall meet again."
"115740052-0-47300";"There is … nothing here. The room is empty. Even the book has no words."
"115740052-0-47301";"Leave open the door to the Crux. What does it matter?"
"115740052-0-47302";"We must secure the Crux. The truth must stay a secret."
"115740052-0-47304";"The mortals of Skyrim know the Great Eye as Herma-Mora. Gather the sacred tears."
"115740052-0-47305";"The Ayleids called my master Hyrma Mora. Pity they're long gone. I found them interesting."
"115740052-0-47306";"Hermorah is the Great Eye's name among the Khajiit. Gather the tear, mortal."
"115740052-0-47308";"Did you see that? Stonefalls, Malabal Tor … and a Dwemer ruin. Fascinating."
"115740052-0-47309";"Very well! Let's see where we're going this time …."
"115740052-0-47310";"You can do this, Plokun. First, picture Fargrave. The cool gray rocks, the brilliant skyscape, Madam Whim's satiny voice …."
"115740052-0-47311";"Not a good start. Mortal, hold the compass near the fissure so I can repair it!"
"115740052-0-47312";"No doors. Still trapped. Get me out of here. I want to read!"
"115740052-0-47313";"Ah, I opened a portal but it's unstable. Bring the compass to it!"
"115740052-0-47314";"Good work, mortal! Nearly done."
"115740052-0-47315";"Oh, not again. We must repair those four rifts. Mind your fingers."
"115740052-0-47316";"Finally, it is done."
"115740052-0-47317";"Meln! We can't just summon the dead whenever we please! It's forbidden."
"115740052-0-47318";"Yes, yes. Summoning is an affront to your order. But if the spirit is already there …."
"115740052-0-47319";"Is this it, Vorm? Just a little light reading? Wait—what happened to the pages? Have a look around, friend. See if you can find them."
"115740052-0-47320";"If you find something boring, you're probably on the right track."
"115740052-0-47322";"The tower's locked tight. We need another way inside."
"115740052-0-47328";"No progress yet. I'll keep you informed."
"115740052-0-47332";"Of course Morian didn't stay in his cell. Who are you? One of the Dreamcarvers?"
"115740052-0-47335";"Shelreni's private study. Her presence is strong here."
"115740052-0-47336";"Blightcrown! He killed me! I'll destroy them all!"
"115740052-0-47339";"Why is this happening?"
"115740052-0-47340";"Because you are too scared to save the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-47343";"Calm yourself, Scruut. I am sure Apocrypha is not as bad as you say. Ah, proxy. Tell me what happened at Tel Baro."
"115740052-0-47345";"As I feared, the entrance to the Infinite Panopticon has moved."
"115740052-0-47346";"This should surprise our invaders."
"115740052-0-47347";"Ah yes, another subject to help perfect our brew!"
"115740052-0-47348";"Our fire traps should ignite now."
"115740052-0-47349";"It won't be long now, Frielvi's just about empty. Did she say something about a Known Thing?"
"115740052-0-47350";"We hope this one hurts."
"115740052-0-47351";"Frielvi? What are you doing bleeding out like that?"
"115740052-0-47352";"Enough! Bend to Peryite's will and taste my putrescent blades!"
"115740052-0-47353";"You cannot stop the oncoming plague."
"115740052-0-47354";"Soon you'll fall, and Necrom will follow!"
"115740052-0-47355";"Reynila was here, huh? Let's have a look around."
"115740052-0-47356";"I think Vaermina's presence has somehow intensified Blightcrown's corruption."
"115740052-0-47357";"What a mess! If we survive, the Great Eye will probably make me clean it up."
"115740052-0-47358";"A hole in the debris! They must have gone that way."
"115740052-0-47359";"Those cultists are in our way. Dispatch them, mortal!"
"115740052-0-47363";"Meet you there. And don't go blundering in without me."
"115740052-0-47364";"It's excited! Feel it in the air? You open the Known Thing. I'll help tilt it toward the Seekers."
"115740052-0-47365";"Keep your mouth closed. Don't contradict the truth. And don't die!"
"115740052-0-47367";"Hey, merc. Over here."
"115740052-0-47368";"We did it. Hurry portals. Escape."
"115740052-0-47369";"Another Daedric Prince memory? You take me to the nicest places."
"115740052-0-47370";"We need to discuss this, mortal."
"115740052-0-47371";"This portal should take us to the tower."
"115740052-0-47372";"The lords sleep! Come down here. We can sneak past their dreams together."
"115740052-0-47373";"Blocked? Outside when we're supposed to be inside. Spiders. A spider should do it. Find one!"
"115740052-0-47374";"There! Spiders are studious. They write down all the answers. Look. Look!"
"115740052-0-47375";"You need to put the inkwell back on the rocks. Make the boom! But don't spill."
"115740052-0-47376";"Hey, looks good as new! Well, all things considered. Anyway, grab that boring book and let's get going!"
"115740052-0-47377";"If everything turns black, that means I'm dead. Have fun!"
"115740052-0-47378";"A door? I usually go in through the windows. No matter, it's open now."
"115740052-0-47379";"That is a lot of Seekers. This might be harder than— Wait! Yes! The Known Thing!"
"115740052-0-47380";"I feel freedom in my ribs."
"115740052-0-47381";"Once again, Meln to the rescue. When you get close to a flaw, use my ghost sight to spot it."
"115740052-0-47382";"This one was dead when we got here, right? Check around. Maybe we'll find something useful."
"115740052-0-47383";"I have done the unthinkable. Now I must make sure it cannot be undone."
"115740052-0-47384";"I shall divide the only remaining memory of the event—my memory—and hide it in three glyphics."
"115740052-0-47385";"The way it began, secured inside the Glyphic of Hidden Paths."
"115740052-0-47386";"The arguments that followed, locked within the Glyphic of Lost Memories."
"115740052-0-47387";"And with regret, the memory of what I had to do, sealed inside the Glyphic of Shattered Reflections."
"115740052-0-47390";"Who dares invade my private memories?"
"115740052-0-47391";"How dare Vaermina enter my realm!"
"115740052-0-47392";"Find her! Protect the three glyphics. Go and enter the Mythos!"
"115740052-0-47394";"This is the Mythos, deep beneath the Ichor Sea. Another memory, or more of the same?"
"115740052-0-47395";"This is the core of Apocrypha. Remember how Torvesard altered a memory and changed the past? The damage they can cause here is enormous!"
"115740052-0-47397";"Now, mortal! Step into the Eye of Mora."
"115740052-0-47411";"How much longer, Torvesard?"
"115740052-0-47412";"These locks have held for millennia. Just a little more …."
"115740052-0-47413";"No! Hermaeus Mora approaches!"
"115740052-0-47423";"Vaermina will pay for the damage she has wrought on my realm!"
"115740052-0-47424";"The wrecked ships are ahead, through these sea caves. Look for my father's belongings. If we find them, we'll likely find him as well!"
"115740052-0-47425";"I am alive. I should be dead. I need time to think all this over. Let's gather the items my father's spirit spoke of and go back to the brazier where you found me."
"115740052-0-47426";"Let's get this book back together!"
"115740052-0-47427";"Fate's chosen returns. I am eager to hear what happened, proxy."
"115740052-0-47428";"Hello traveler! I hope the main hall isn't too imposing, I assure you the rest of the Sidereal Cloisters is far more welcoming. Let me know when you're ready to venture forward."
"115740052-0-47429";"This portal leads outside. You must travel to Ald Isra from there. Defenses around Tel Huulen play havoc with portal magic."
"115740052-0-47430";"From the tracks, it looks like two fleeing, two in pursuit."
"115740052-0-47431";"Let's get down to the ritual circle. The real one, not that light show on the rug."
"115740052-0-47433";"There's a spell hook here, just have to draw it down and … there we go. Let's head below."
"115740052-0-47435";"Now, ever so gently take the rime shard and …."
"115740052-0-47436";"How tiresome. You've brought your companion. No matter. I am prepared."
"115740052-0-47437";"Bah! I'm starting to think you're the version of me that never learned when to shut up!"
"115740052-0-47438";"Glib to the last. We will tear that out of you! And then I will take my rightful spot in your fateline!"
"115740052-0-47439";"You'll never be rid of me. Not while my anchor remains!"
"115740052-0-47440";"His anchor…? Mora's Eyes! The Key! The Fateweaver Key is a final anchor. We … damn it. We must destroy it."
"115740052-0-47442";"Oh! I mean, it's supposed to do that. Now hurry! Grab the book before the effect wears off!"
"115740052-0-47444";"You got it! Now hurry back before you and the book burn to a crisp!"
"115740052-0-47445";"Strange, seems I have fewer books to return than I remember. Don't you love when that happens? Onwards to Loggia Infinitum!"
"115740052-0-47446";"Oh! Fellow researcher. Look at what I found."
"115740052-0-47447";"Wamasu are such misunderstood creatures."
"115740052-0-47448";"They're known as aggressive, volatile beasts. But look, this one is harmless."
"115740052-0-47449";"Just extraordinary! Such peaceful creatures after all!"
"115740052-0-47450";"What's this barrier doing here? Is this Telenger's doing? That hack!"
"115740052-0-47451";"Ah, my counterpart. Forgive me, I am responsible for the barrier. I simply can't have you two interrupting me."
"115740052-0-47452";"There it is. I couldn't wait to see the look on your face. The realization I have access to all of your theorems, relics, and research."
"115740052-0-47453";"Your tomes were most instructive. The ritual has already begun. Your life is mine. Goodbye. For the last time."
"115740052-0-47455";"They carried the Fulcrum Obscura through this door, proxy."
"115740052-0-47456";"Oh hello there! You're a gentle beast … aren't you?"
"115740052-0-47457";"Over here, mortal. You won't get far without my boon to guide you through Underweave!"
"115740052-0-47458";"They couldn't have gone too far."
"115740052-0-47459";"Looks like Reynila and one other got away. Got rid of her tail, and managed to hide her prints from here with magic."
"115740052-0-47460";"I'll meet you there. I just need a minute."
"115740052-0-47461";"Any delay is unacceptable! We hired the Morag Tong to deal with this problem."
"115740052-0-47462";"Master Foves. A word, if I may."
"115740052-0-47463";"Bellow all you want. It won't change my process."
"115740052-0-47465";"Come Guitot. Leave the hireling to her work."
"115740052-0-47466";"Yes, Master Foves."
"115740052-0-47467";"Master Foves, calm yourself. This solves nothing."
"115740052-0-47469";"You, hireling. Follow me."
"115740052-0-47471";"Outsider, a word."
"115740052-0-47472";"It's no use, I'm done for—wait. What is that?"
"115740052-0-47473";"See that? Two lanterns—that's got to be Mevei."
"115740052-0-47475";"Sharp-as-Night? By Azura, after all these years, is it really you?"
"115740052-0-47476";"I was afraid you'd say something like that."
"115740052-0-47477";"Sharp, Reynila would say that you're under no obligation to help. But, please—"
"115740052-0-47478";"I think there's a secret entrance in the southwest tunnels. I'll follow shortly. Please—hurry!"
"115740052-0-47479";"I'm on my way. Where are these smuggler's tunnels you mentioned?"
"115740052-0-47480";"Reynila, I'm here. Just stay still."
"115740052-0-47482";"Tell me, assassin. Have you dealt with our spy?"
"115740052-0-47483";"Not yet, but I'm about to."
"115740052-0-47484";"You are in for a treat! Onwards to the Empyrean Ascent!"
"115740052-0-47485";"Activating the rune got the Guardian's attention. There must be more of them."
"115740052-0-47486";"The Guardian is distracted. Now, through the portal to the north."
"115740052-0-47487";"No use denying it. Assassin, complete your writ."
"115740052-0-47488";"No! Master Foves made me! I didn't have a choice!"
"115740052-0-47489";"Return to the antechamber. I will meet you there so we can gain entrance to the inner laboratory."
"115740052-0-47490";"Tossed in your pack? I expect you to find a nice silk pouch for my gem at the first opportunity. Now, let's be off."
"115740052-0-47491";"Time to end this, Tredecim."
"115740052-0-47492";"People leave trash everywhere, don't they?"
"115740052-0-47493";"Why would Voidprowler brutes keep notes?"
"115740052-0-47494";"If you would like, I could offer a few suggestions? Some of my favorites, perhaps."
"115740052-0-47496";"Look above us. The Eye of Mora! Leramil's portal deposited us on the ceiling!"
"115740052-0-47497";"Each portal gets us one step closer to the Eye of Mora. Maybe Leramil's a better spellcaster than I thought."
"115740052-0-47498";"We made it. The Eye of Mora! With or without Leramil, you need to go in after Blightcrown and Torvesard."
"115740052-0-47500";"That would be appreciated, Meenai-Shai. Though, perhaps, let me collect them this time."
"115740052-0-47501";"Other researchers should be ashamed. Spreading false information? It goes against integrity itself!"
"115740052-0-47502";"Gadayn of Necrom, you tend the archive of corpses?"
"115740052-0-47503";"Never heard it called that before. But yes, yes I do. Would … would you like a tour of the catacombs?"
"115740052-0-47504";"Perhaps … later. Hermaeus Mora's proxy returns."
"115740052-0-47505";"Ah, of course. I'm sure the two of you have much to discuss."
"115740052-0-47506";"The stacks aren't far at all. I'll see you there!"
"115740052-0-47507";"That's enough. Bring what you found to Hezehk."
"115740052-0-47510";"A letter and a murdered magister. I know what we must do, proxy."
"115740052-0-47511";"The search for knowledge begins! Hah!"
"115740052-0-47512";"Incantus Eruditum. Abyssal sea hear my call. Find the secrets beneath this scrawl."
"115740052-0-47513";"Be ready, Apocrypha does not give up her secrets lightly."
"115740052-0-47514";"Another disturbance in the currents of fate and what do I find? The Great Eye's mortal surrogate. Again."
"115740052-0-47518";"The runeform is complete. Follow where it leads."
"115740052-0-47521";"The Midden stacks have been reluctant to yield the answers I had hoped for."
"115740052-0-47522";"You should be able to see a magical trace of my master's fated glyphic. We must find it before it's unwoven."
"115740052-0-47523";"Apocrypha itself works against you. But the Great Eye's surrogate had some success."
"115740052-0-47524";"Indeed? Show me, proxy."
"115740052-0-47525";"The ritual is broken. We should ascend the tower to survey the damage."
"115740052-0-47526";"See here? The intake chamber. Deposit a secret, get a boon."
"115740052-0-47527";"Gadayn, take this charm. It shall mark you as my guest in Apocrypha and keep you safe."
"115740052-0-47528";"That's … most thoughtful, Leramil. Thank you."
"115740052-0-47529";"The Infinite Panopticon is kept hidden for a good reason, Leramil."
"115740052-0-47530";"Which is why we must locate it and protect it from the enemy."
"115740052-0-47531";"This is the sort of quandary that makes my tentacles twitch …."
"115740052-0-47532";"Scruut, please make sure Curate Gadayn returns safely to Necrom. His work here is done."
"115740052-0-47533";"It's burning up! Quickly, grab whatever remains!"
"115740052-0-47534";"A brittle, old tome. Handle it carefully."
"115740052-0-47535";"The book crumbled to dust! Hopefully the pages you recovered contain something relevant."
"115740052-0-47536";"An ancient tome describing lost memories barely remembered in a dream? Too bad you only retrieved a few pages."
"115740052-0-47537";"The spell drew that book from the stack! Quick, grab it!"
"115740052-0-47538";"Recover the glyphics, proxy …."
"115740052-0-47539";"Bring the glyphics here. We need to talk."
"115740052-0-47540";"Heed my words, mortal."
"115740052-0-47541";"I suggest you defend yourself, mortal."
"115740052-0-47542";"Excellent work!"
"115740052-0-47543";"There. That should open the way to the Crux."
"115740052-0-47544";"To form a lock that holds tight the door."
"115740052-0-47545";"To pierce the void and see our promise held."
"115740052-0-47546";"To bind us all through ancient wisdom."
"115740052-0-47547";"Poor Hulnan! The Seeker just swooped in, struck him down, flew off. They've never attacked the settlement before!"
"115740052-0-47548";"How disappointing. Another name that over promises and under delivers. Ah, well. We might as well look around."
"115740052-0-47549";"No, you were supposed to use the other entrance!"
"115740052-0-47550";"Master Shelreni murdered me to avoid the scrutiny of the Assembly of Masters. What else might she do to further her ambitions?"
"115740052-0-47551";"No arched gateway here. I suppose we'll need to go deeper inside."
"115740052-0-47552";"It's back! My master's fated glyphic is really back!"
"115740052-0-47553";"Look around, mortal. We need more information before I attempt to activate this gateway."
"115740052-0-47554";"Contradictions cling to those tools like void-ticks adhere to a Watcher's tentacles. Leave them for now. We need to deal with the gateway."
"115740052-0-47555";"This is bad, but at least we have the invocation needed to activate the gateway."
"115740052-0-47557";"Yes, yes! Let's leave before the guards come and take Ogle away!"
"115740052-0-47560";"You there! You look like a capable forager! I need some help. Can we talk?"
"115740052-0-47561";"Valinna betrayed Hermaeus Mora for this place?"
"115740052-0-47562";"Keshargo has to be so scared. He doesn't even know we're coming for him."
"115740052-0-47563";"Phew. It's sweltering in here."
"115740052-0-47564";"Kra! Zilipif, this one swears the latch was right here."
"115740052-0-47566";"Well. Here goes nothing, Cosma."
"115740052-0-47567";"Ah, welcome! You returned at just the right moment. I assume you brought the ingredients?"
"115740052-0-47568";"Dusksabers, here? Careful, proxy. I have faced these vampire mercenaries before."
"115740052-0-47572";"Do be careful, don't rush about and scatter the dust."
"115740052-0-47574";"Psst! You! Yes, the one who talked to Balver. Follow me!"
"115740052-0-47575";"… above the moon of Masser …."
"115740052-0-47576";"Friend, the corruption has gotten worse! See to Scruut while I do what I can for Leramil!"
"115740052-0-47577";"And Fire rained down…"
"115740052-0-47578";"… beyond sweet Oblivion, ensnared within the runes of my dark love …."
"115740052-0-47579";"Incoming tides … endless … endless …"
"115740052-0-47580";"Hold, intruder. I failed to stop your allies, but I won't allow any more of you to enter the Catalog."
"115740052-0-47581";"The Pool of Inquiry? I know the way, mortal."
"115740052-0-47582";"Your allies suffer needlessly, mortal. Allow me to aid them."
"115740052-0-47583";"This affliction is beyond my skills, friend. See what the Dremora has to offer."
"115740052-0-47584";"Go ahead and try it on! The cloak will mask your presence and hide your connection to the Prince of Fate."
"115740052-0-47585";"That hunger isn't native to Apocrypha. See how it shifts between the layers of reality? Attack while it's shifted and its energy can power my ghost sight."
"115740052-0-47589";"Ah, my head! Balver is sending some minion to deliver my tincture. About time! Lazy fool couldn't even deliver it himself!"
"115740052-0-47592";"You're almost out of words."
"115740052-0-47593";"Never thought I'd see you put off a chance at escaping, Morian."
"115740052-0-47594";"I hope you have better luck than I did, my friend."
"115740052-0-47595";"And I hope you go someplace where you always have thick socks on."
"115740052-0-47596";"Careless fool. Didn't even take a whiff before guzzling down a vial from a stranger. Well, I suppose his seat is empty now. I wonder who will claim it?"
"115740052-0-47603";"I take no orders from you, Oathman. But my duty to House Telvanni demands I summon the offender to us."
"115740052-0-47604";"Here's your glyphic, Watchling. And you, meddler. Do try to stay out of trouble!"
"115740052-0-47605";"You don't like my nightmares? Then face me in my true form!"
"115740052-0-47606";"It worked? It worked! Is he …? Oh, he is quite dead. Good! Ah ha! I did it! Ahem. I mean we did it! Thank you so much!"
"115740052-0-47607";"We're out of options. Use the Black Book!"
"115740052-0-47608";"Well, we need a replacement. By the power granted me by House Telvanni, I bestow upon you, Balver Bemis, the rank of Oathman. Now begone, before someone poisons you."
"115740052-0-47610";"Over here, mortal. Look at me. Reduced to delivering messages …."
"115740052-0-47611";"Curate Gadayn, are you certain you wish to accompany us?"
"115740052-0-47612";"Absolutely! The relic is my responsibility. Let me just grab a few essentials. I'll be right back!"
"115740052-0-47613";"Fate provides the aid we need, proxy. We will meet you at Cipher's Midden."
"115740052-0-47614";"Dreamcarvers swarm our fortress. It is theirs now."
"115740052-0-47615";"Mora's trinket can't harm me!"
"115740052-0-47616";"No, but it helped me locate a loathsome intruder."
"115740052-0-47617";"While our pact still exists, so do the Remnants."
"115740052-0-47618";"Hermaeus Mora has found me? No!"
"115740052-0-47619";"Wield the book again! Together we'll expel this common thief!"
"115740052-0-47620";"No! I was so close! Curse you, Prince of Fate, and curse your damn mortal!"
"115740052-0-47621";"Vaermina has been cast out and Peryite's contamination wanes. Well done, chosen."
"115740052-0-47622";"Now, enter the second vault and make sure the glyphic is secure."
"115740052-0-47623";"Hah! Well, Spellwright. If you will, do the honors and bring the accused poisoner to us!"
"115740052-0-47624";"Over here, proxy."
"115740052-0-47626";"What? How? No. This is some sort of mistake!"
"115740052-0-47627";"Not even the courage to deliver the poison yourself! Balver Bemis, you are a cretin to the last breath!"
"115740052-0-47628";"Remember to invoke the statute when you demand entry. And put on the cloak!"
"115740052-0-47630";"Quickly, use the rune's power. Cleanse the locus."
"115740052-0-47632";"And now our deal is done, mortal. I helped you save Apocrypha, and you helped me enter this vault."
"115740052-0-47633";"Torvesard? He fooled us both, chosen. Emerge from the Mythos and speak with me."
"115740052-0-47635";"Excellent. Meet us back at the base of the Apogee."
"115740052-0-47636";"The ritual drained our strength. Join us outside once your task is completed."
"115740052-0-47637";"We must discuss what happened, chosen."
"115740052-0-47639";"Trickery? I shall take your mind!"
"115740052-0-47640";"What you have there is incredible, but damned. It corrupted me. It'll do the same to that Givyn mage you're helping."
"115740052-0-47641";"Over here, adventurer. Let's chat."
"115740052-0-47642";"A magister to counter magister magic, eh? Good idea! Let's go disable the ward."
"115740052-0-47648";"We've almost got it! Quickly, the last focus is down here. I can't hold on much longer!"
"115740052-0-47651";"Meln is in my power, Torvesard. He'll unlock the Black Book soon enough."
"115740052-0-47652";"He better, Shelreni. We need the rite hidden within The Tormenting Eye or else all is for naught."
"115740052-0-47653";"Tell the Princes. I'll uphold my end of the bargain. I expect them to uphold theirs."
"115740052-0-47654";"Return to Cipher's Midden. We will speak again."
"115740052-0-47657";"Torvesard spoke true. We can reach the Mythos from here. But first we must align the threads of fate."
"115740052-0-47658";"Assist me, proxy. I can align the threads through your capacity as fate's chosen. Touch each thread in turn."
"115740052-0-47659";"The path to the Mythos awaits, mortal. Let us not linger too long."
"115740052-0-47660";"On behalf of the Ciphers of Mora, my thanks. You have done us a great service by dealing with Akacirn, traveler."
"115740052-0-47661";"Something's going on to the north. I think the conclave is starting."
"115740052-0-47662";"The Creator is done, but I have more to say."
"115740052-0-47663";"But I will kill you all before I take my sacrifice and depart."
"115740052-0-47664";"Tem is summoned. Ask your questions. Make your offerings."
"115740052-0-47665";"We offer the dust of an ancient spell. I seek the location of my former colleague, Martina Abor."
"115740052-0-47666";"The body of Meln the Mouthless. It is clear he was murdered at this very spot."
"115740052-0-47667";"Ingenious, Torvesard! Using the restored memory to open a path to Apocrypha. All we need now is for Shelreni to finish the rite and perform the sacrifice."
"115740052-0-47668";"I regret the bloodshed, but soon Mora's injustice will be undone."
"115740052-0-47669";"Prince Vaermina accepts your sacrifice and deems you a worthy vessel!"
"115740052-0-47670";"… Who are you, old man?"
"115740052-0-47671";"I am … No. I am a friend of your father's. Come, let's talk."
"115740052-0-47672";"That letter from Master Shelreni's mouth. That meeting must have been when Meln was murdered."
"115740052-0-47673";"I shall answer. But not to you, arcanist. Tem will speak with the one who made the offerings."
"115740052-0-47676";"Questions asked and answered. Farewell, mortals."
"115740052-0-47677";"All things being equal, that went rather well. It seems we're off to the Underweave. Exciting."
"115740052-0-47682";"You destroyed my mortal shell! Now face a true nightmare!"
"115740052-0-47683";"While I wear Shelreni's mortal shell, Mora cannot find me. You must face me alone, mortal!"
"115740052-0-47684";"Welcome! I've just been preparing, pardon the simplicity of my setup here."
"115740052-0-47685";"The likes of you won't stop me!"
"115740052-0-47687";"I am the master of the Probabilis. Stop this attack!"
"115740052-0-47688";"Why won't you let me fix what he couldn't?"
"115740052-0-47691";"All right, let's get my fates unfrayed!"
"115740052-0-47692";"Damn it, Martina. Dead. I had hoped …."
"115740052-0-47693";"Martina was a zealous note-taker, that may be helpful to our inquiry."
"115740052-0-47694";"Why must the most brilliant among us fall to curiosity's blade?"
"115740052-0-47695";"Take a look around, if you don't mind. I need a moment."
"115740052-0-47697";"Come, come. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-47700";"A shipwreck? Wait … that must be Fathoms Drift. Superlative!"
"115740052-0-47701";"The Drift is in the far north of the region. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-47702";"Here you are. The rats scurrying around to cause trouble."
"115740052-0-47703";"Ah, there you are. Tell me, how fares the fruits of our labor?"
"115740052-0-47704";"In desperation, all things consume one another."
"115740052-0-47705";"Is this a sign of imperfection, or is this the fundamental truth of creations? Is it separate from the morality of the mortal world?"
"115740052-0-47706";"Others believe in chaos. They think their choices give them agency."
"115740052-0-47707";"Activate the foci above us while I conjure a portal. With any luck, we'll reveal all of Dreynis's little secrets."
"115740052-0-47708";"I know differently, and yet I find myself hesitating. Am I actually worried my actions lead to failure?"
"115740052-0-47709";"Time wears you down to nothing. You break and stagnate. How do I keep you functioning after I leave?"
"115740052-0-47712";"I can see again!"
"115740052-0-47713";"Go, proxy. I shall join you at the location."
"115740052-0-47714";"There's one of the cairns. Sprinkle the dust while I focus the relic."
"115740052-0-47715";"Look, another cairn!"
"115740052-0-47716";"There's the final cairn!"
"115740052-0-47717";"Right. This malignancy allows the corrupted guardians to phase between layers of reality. When we get close, use my ghost sight to find the source."
"115740052-0-47721";"What? A sailor? How odd, I haven't wanted to be a sailor since I was a child."
"115740052-0-47722";"No? Pity. I'll take those glyphics now, Leramil."
"115740052-0-47723";"Proxy, Dralys is the traitor! You must stop him!"
"115740052-0-47724";"Neither Scruut nor I can feel Hermaeus Mora's presence. We both find this … unsettling."
"115740052-0-47725";"Leramil's idea is a good one. Master Shelreni has the answer we seek and I know how to reach her."
"115740052-0-47726";"Door unlocked. Place looks abandoned. We're off to a great start."
"115740052-0-47727";"If I help you, I could jeopardize my standing."
"115740052-0-47728";"We would not ask this of you if the situation was not dire."
"115740052-0-47729";"I … of course I'll help, Leramil."
"115740052-0-47730";"Hey! Who are you?"
"115740052-0-47731";"Federo only drinks sugary Sujamma cocktails. The wine bottles can't be his."
"115740052-0-47733";"Over there. Just let me …."
"115740052-0-47734";"There, easy enough for a magister to remove a master's ward. Let's go inside."
"115740052-0-47735";"Here's our wine drinker. I can smell it on her. Where's Federo? Who are you?"
"115740052-0-47736";"I'm … Federo's betrothed! Leave now, before I call the guards!"
"115740052-0-47737";"Right. And I'm Lady Mara, here to bless your union. Who are you really?"
"115740052-0-47739";"Telvanni towers always have more than a single ingress and egress. Look around."
"115740052-0-47740";"Those are rags by Federo's standards. Not his style at all. I hate that I know that."
"115740052-0-47741";"My ghost sight allows you to see it. Move closer and I'll try to get her to manifest fully."
"115740052-0-47742";"Blightcrown serves Peryite, but orders the Hidden Kindred to work with Vaermina? Strange allies indeed."
"115740052-0-47743";"Such rage and suffering! Let me try to calm her."
"115740052-0-47744";"Feh! Old fool."
"115740052-0-47746";"Have you come to gloat? To see how far the mighty Shelreni has fallen?"
"115740052-0-47747";"The invaders shattered the portal's seal. We need to follow them to the Pool of Inquiry."
"115740052-0-47748";"Sharp? Stranger …. What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-47749";"I could ask you the same—oh, no. You're the forgery expert, aren't you?"
"115740052-0-47750";"Keep your voice down!"
"115740052-0-47751";"Our contact wanted new clothing, too. Any idea where we might find something easy on the coin purse?"
"115740052-0-47752";"There's a tailor in the armorer's place across town. Standard prices, though. I'd help, if I had coin to spare."
"115740052-0-47753";"You're here! It's so pleasant to work with someone so prompt. And cunning!"
"115740052-0-47754";"Into the drift! Huzzah!"
"115740052-0-47755";"Up the ramp! I think I see something."
"115740052-0-47756";"If only those priests had listened to you, Rilasi. You know it's not too late to switch si—"
"115740052-0-47758";"Shut up! I'm not switching sides!"
"115740052-0-47760";"…"
"115740052-0-47761";"…"
"115740052-0-47763";"Windhelm Outlaws Refuge … do I have anyone here who wants to kill me? I don't think so."
"115740052-0-47764";"Hehehe. What wonders will you reveal to me?"
"115740052-0-47765";"Oh sweet little prism. What will you show me?"
"115740052-0-47766";"Together we will climb into the innards of this world!"
"115740052-0-47767";"Ah, this is the glyphic! Now I know where to find the memory of the dream your Prince helped me remember, despite your predilections, Ryl."
"115740052-0-47768";"Prince Vaermina commands me to punish Mora's servants, clanless. So I do."
"115740052-0-47769";"Excessive and pointless, but I have what I came for. I'm leaving."
"115740052-0-47770";"Do what you will. I'll deal with our eavesdroppers."
"115740052-0-47771";"Ah, there you are! Come, let's talk. I'm ecstatic! Ebullient, even."
"115740052-0-47772";"Together, cohort, we will accomplish stupendous things. Remarkable things! For research!"
"115740052-0-47773";"As is its nature. Which means we have failed and reality is doomed."
"115740052-0-47774";"I refuse this outcome. Fate, bend to my will!"
"115740052-0-47775";"Leramil, be careful!"
"115740052-0-47776";"There is no time. The Panopticon … must exist … here. I command it!"
"115740052-0-47777";"Leramil, you did it! The Panopticon is open!"
"115740052-0-47778";"Oh no! Vaermina, her presence is destroying the Panopticon!"
"115740052-0-47779";"Leramil, look at yourself. You're in no shape to continue!"
"115740052-0-47780";"Nonsense, I … no, you are right. Proxy, you must deal with Vaermina. Gadayn will help me return to Cipher's Midden."
"115740052-0-47781";"That was part of the true memory. Find me more flaws to break, mortal!"
"115740052-0-47782";"This must be the memory of when Hermaeus Mora hid the secret the enemy seeks."
"115740052-0-47787";"We need to hurry, mortal!"
"115740052-0-47788";"We're sure the glyphic is on the other side of that door? That we can reach it through this memory?"
"115740052-0-47791";"We must deal with this problem, Dreamweaver. I have seen what happens if we do nothing."
"115740052-0-47792";"Already the threads of fate unravel. They have no regard for the chaos they can cause!"
"115740052-0-47793";"Why have you called us all together, Prince of Fate?"
"115740052-0-47794";"That's it! What I needed to spark my memory! I will restore the rest, Lord of Secrets. I will restore it all!"
"115740052-0-47795";"Security oversight protocols becoming available. Searching for Apostle Nilphas Drethan."
"115740052-0-47796";"The Probabilis is spinning too quickly. Find a way to slow it."
"115740052-0-47797";"Come! You obey me now!"
"115740052-0-47798";"They have emerged. And unharmed. What fate comes for our order, then?"
"115740052-0-47799";"We agree. The time has come to end our order. We must make our own way."
"115740052-0-47800";"See what we have done—the Cenotaph stands! Our order can rekindle its strength. This proves it."
"115740052-0-47801";"Your sorcery deceives good people. It brings nothing but pain, malpracticer!"
"115740052-0-47802";"This is for my daughter."
"115740052-0-47803";"Give me a moment. Never tried this with someone watching me before."
"115740052-0-47805";"Twelvane!"
"115740052-0-47806";"You're angry, Vanton. You can destroy the intruders. You can make them suffer."
"115740052-0-47807";"Come on, Vanton. You've seen what we can do together. Don't you want to rule the Mages Guild?"
"115740052-0-47808";"You were nothing before me, Vanton. You'll be nothing without me."
"115740052-0-47809";"You come into my mind without my permission? You deserve to burn!"
"115740052-0-47810";"We did accomplish a lot. But I can't rule with all these people in my head!"
"115740052-0-47811";"I'm nothing. But, together we're more powerful. And no one will stand in our way."
"115740052-0-47812";"No. I don't want to be that angry. Not ever."
"115740052-0-47813";"I'm no ruler. You made me do terrible things! I don't want that."
"115740052-0-47814";"I was something. A powerful mage. This is my head. Get out of it!"
"115740052-0-47815";"A Daedric shrine? Wonderful."
"115740052-0-47816";"Who gave you the right? This is my mind!"
"115740052-0-47817";"Perfect, Vanton. Use that anger. Fight back against them."
"115740052-0-47818";"You want to keep me small and afraid."
"115740052-0-47819";"They're afraid of you, Vanton. Afraid you'll burn them."
"115740052-0-47820";"My anger is my strength. I'll burn everything that stands in my way!"
"115740052-0-47821";"Your hatred will serve Vaermina well!"
"115740052-0-47822";"You're keeping me from reaching my potential."
"115740052-0-47823";"That's right. They want you to be weak. Powerless."
"115740052-0-47824";"Why are you trying to hold me back?"
"115740052-0-47825";"I suppose I need to activate this bridge for you. It would be easier for both of us if you could just float."
"115740052-0-47826";"They don't think you're strong enough. Destroy them."
"115740052-0-47827";"Torvesard has already accessed the knowledge preserved in this glyphic. We should find out what it contains."
"115740052-0-47828";"You're just like Twelvane. Always putting me down—stomping on my abilities."
"115740052-0-47829";"No one will be able to stop you anymore. Vaermina will see to that."
"115740052-0-47830";"Ansuul and I cannot be stopped, in any reality."
"115740052-0-47831";"Three tomes emerged from the glyphic! Read them, mortal!"
"115740052-0-47832";"With your body and my power we will make everyone live in fear."
"115740052-0-47833";"This can't be happening. Why are they fighting back?"
"115740052-0-47834";"These tomes were reluctant to dispense their information. I wonder if Torvesard learned more. Let's discuss this, mortal."
"115740052-0-47835";"You're weak, Vanton. But we have the strength to keep fighting."
"115740052-0-47836";"I see it now. You can make me strong, Ansuul."
"115740052-0-47837";"That's right. Together, we will carry out Vaermina's will."
"115740052-0-47838";"Our fate was sealed when the Dreamcarvers arrived. Good that you see that."
"115740052-0-47839";"Our gifts return and we hear our thoughts once more. Perhaps the Remnants can still serve."
"115740052-0-47840";"You couldn't save Twelvane. You aren't powerful enough to save anyone. You're weak!"
"115740052-0-47841";"You can make this stop … can't you?"
"115740052-0-47842";"Together, we can make it so no mage is ever hunted again."
"115740052-0-47843";"Federo marked the map between those two boulders. Guessing it's just under the snow …."
"115740052-0-47844";"There we go. Quick! Follow it!"
"115740052-0-47845";"Come on, little one. Keep going."
"115740052-0-47846";"Tall ceiling, many steps, and the weight of truth ahead? I can't wait any longer!"
"115740052-0-47847";"With Twelvane in charge, there will be no weaklings left. You'll rise above the rabble."
"115740052-0-47848";"I can't stand up to Twelvane. Not when she's like this."
"115740052-0-47850";"Is this place not the crowning glory of the hall? These treasures, not those rotting books."
"115740052-0-47851";"Tempting though it may be to keep it, I suppose I should just toss this wretched prism into the sea."
"115740052-0-47852";"What the—!?"
"115740052-0-47853";"That treasure is not to be wasted on a mortal like you!"
"115740052-0-47854";"Are mortal villages typically so broken and on fire?"
"115740052-0-47855";"Look what they did to this village. It's an outrage!"
"115740052-0-47856";"Even when you have more power than you could dream of, you fail. You're nothing without me."
"115740052-0-47857";"That's not true. You're wrong. This feels … wrong."
"115740052-0-47858";"I'm wrong? You're the one who failed time and time again. You need me, Vanton."
"115740052-0-47859";"Open your mind. Let me in. Together, we can be strong."
"115740052-0-47860";"Oh, look at that. The cultists are already dead. One less thing to worry about."
"115740052-0-47861";"Be careful with that. Let's get back to Dimik-ei."
"115740052-0-47862";"All of these dead cultists served the Prince of Domination? I'm just stunned things didn't end well for them."
"115740052-0-47863";"Bah! I should have guessed Shelreni Baro was involved in whatever happened here!"
"115740052-0-47864";"Who are you? Are you one of hers? She's hurting me."
"115740052-0-47865";"I can't keep her out much longer. Help me. Please."
"115740052-0-47867";"Magical scum! All you're good for is kindling. This is for the lives you claim with your powers."
"115740052-0-47868";"Magic is a tool. It's not—"
"115740052-0-47869";"Slit his throat before he tells more lies."
"115740052-0-47870";"Run, Vanton!"
"115740052-0-47871";"Come with me!"
"115740052-0-47872";"If it isn't the wizard, Twelvane. You deserve my personal attention."
"115740052-0-47873";"You are beneath us. You who cannot wield even the smallest spell."
"115740052-0-47874";"This one created a creature with magic in its veins. It will rip you all to pieces!"
"115740052-0-47875";"You're strong, Vanton. Don't you feel it?"
"115740052-0-47876";"This isn't right."
"115740052-0-47877";"Join Twelvane. Take control. It's what you want."
"115740052-0-47878";"Is it?"
"115740052-0-47880";"Why are you here little Sload? Gifts of knowledge for the floating ones. Hmm, our feet touch ground."
"115740052-0-47881";"Goo from Oblivion. It's too old to hear but, there are big thoughts in there. A mind that wants to swallow me."
"115740052-0-47882";"Hello? Oh, you need celery root. It'll help you be less worried about having your magic turn you into ether."
"115740052-0-47883";"Try your hardest to fight it, Sharp. It will help me ferret out any weaknesses."
"115740052-0-47886";"If I could tear you to pieces right now, you know I would."
"115740052-0-47887";"Be reasonable, Sharp. Just give me the bucket."
"115740052-0-47888";"Leramil's amazing! Who else could help us find the Panopticon?"
"115740052-0-47889";"Do you think Leramil has read all these books?"
"115740052-0-47890";"The other keepers are never going to believe this. Usually when we misplace a relic, we find it behind a couch in the abbey."
"115740052-0-47891";"The cairns have been activated, Leramil!"
"115740052-0-47892";"Well done. Now to complete the ritual."
"115740052-0-47893";"Why do you still hesitate, Vanton?"
"115740052-0-47894";"With the beast, no one can stand in our way. Look!"
"115740052-0-47895";"Hmm, I sense something amiss. Use my ghost sight to look around."
"115740052-0-47896";"Look!"
"115740052-0-47897";"Hmm. This bridge wasn't here a moment ago. I suggest we cross it."
"115740052-0-47898";"That did it! Vanton's calmed down. His mind feels clearer, too!"
"115740052-0-47899";"Wizard Twelvane? But … you died. Or you were a tyrant …."
"115740052-0-47900";"All of that was a nightmare, Vanton. Ansuul is gone."
"115740052-0-47901";"It felt … so real."
"115740052-0-47902";"Even in dreams, our emotions are real. Rest. You'll feel better when you wake."
"115740052-0-47903";"Sharp as ever. Now, feel the resonance. You should understand what I want you to do without me saying anything at all."
"115740052-0-47904";"It's the bucket, isn't it? Let's make a deal. I bring you the bucket, and then I get to drown you in it."
"115740052-0-47905";"Wonderful! You sensed and acted on my desires, all without me having to say a word. Well? How was it?"
"115740052-0-47906";"Sharp, help! He's here! He's—"
"115740052-0-47907";"… too far, Mora!"
"115740052-0-47908";"It doesn't matter what you foresee …."
"115740052-0-47909";"… reality, you must all … forget!"
"115740052-0-47910";"Where is she? Where did she go?"
"115740052-0-47911";"I felt your resonance, Sharp. Your resistance. Even with your little conduit."
"115740052-0-47912";"An obscure invocation. Where did Shelreni dig it up, I wonder."
"115740052-0-47913";"Dimik-ei. Where is she?"
"115740052-0-47914";"She's safe with me. The stars aligned so I would find you again. Submit yourself to me, Sharp, and I'll let her go. I'll let all my slaves go."
"115740052-0-47915";"What?"
"115740052-0-47916";"You are my price. Find me. I know you can. Submit to me. I know you will."
"115740052-0-47917";"And there it is. Another piece of my memory restored. We should speak, mortal."
"115740052-0-47918";"What was forgotten has been remembered. We must speak."
"115740052-0-47919";"Tel Huulen, the tower of halls. Home to the Assembly of Masters."
"115740052-0-47921";"There's Curate Gadayn."
"115740052-0-47922";"Now where is that Curate? We should find out where Gadayn has gone."
"115740052-0-47923";"That's Master Norvora's mouth. We need to extract Gadayn this instant."
"115740052-0-47927";"Let it be known that the name of fate's chosen shall be entered into the Chronicle of Apocrypha, to be remembered forever for actions accomplished in service to fate."
"115740052-0-47928";"That's not all, they also helped return three very important tomes to their proper place in the Sidereal Cloisters."
"115740052-0-47929";"That mortal helped me find a secret. Madam Whim took a century off Hezehk's debt."
"115740052-0-47930";"This strong mortal bravely fought the Dreamcarvers alongside us."
"115740052-0-47931";"Incredible, considering they also helped rid the Rectory Corporea of a rogue mind causing havoc."
"115740052-0-47932";"And fate's chosen confounded the forces of Vaermina and Peryite, saving Nirn and Apocrypha! Let this record describe it in flowery yet justified praise. All hail fate's chosen!"
"115740052-0-47933";"Now that the immediate danger has passed, I would like that tour of your catacombs now."
"115740052-0-47934";"You … you would? Um, we'll meet you in Necrom, friend!"
"115740052-0-47938";"Well done, curate! With the sacred relic returned, I feel it's safe to once again open the necropolis. Now, why don't you say a few words about your adventures."
"115740052-0-47939";"Say a few words? Me?"
"115740052-0-47940";"Say what is in your heart, Gadayn."
"115740052-0-47941";"Right. Thanks, Leramil."
"115740052-0-47942";"The abbot asked me to tell you about my adventures. How I recovered the sacred relic and saved the Necropolis."
"115740052-0-47943";"But the truth is, I couldn't have done any of it without fate's champion. Someone I'm proud to call … my friend."
"115740052-0-47944";"Thanks to them, we saved the relic. We saved Nirn. We saved all of reality! All hail fate's champion! All hail my friend!"
"115740052-0-47945";"May I have a word?"
"115740052-0-47947";"Well said, Gadayn."
"115740052-0-47948";"Thanks, Leramil. I couldn't have done any of this without you, too."
"115740052-0-47949";"Gadayn …."
"115740052-0-47950";"Good to see you two again."
"115740052-0-47951";"You too—wait. Federo? Is that really you?"
"115740052-0-47952";"Against my better judgment, yes. It's me. I'm here."
"115740052-0-47955";"Why in Oblivion is Gorne besieged by Daedra? Adventurer, we should find Dreynis. Quickly."
"115740052-0-47956";"The Necropolis is closed? That's never happened before."
"115740052-0-47957";"We Keepers of the Dead understand your frustration. I'm sure the abbot will sort things out in no time."
"115740052-0-47958";"Heard there was some sort of trouble in the Necropolis. When are they going to reopen the catacombs?"
"115740052-0-47959";"I think it might be awhile. I hear it's dangerous inside. Actually, why don't you go take a look for yourself."
"115740052-0-47960";"Have you heard? Rumor is there's a portal to Apocrypha somewhere in the city."
"115740052-0-47961";"A portal you say? Interesting. Maybe I'll go take a look. I've never seen a portal up close."
"115740052-0-47962";"A Conclave of Masters at Ald Isra? When's the last time that happened? And I heard a magister came in from Sadrith Mora."
"115740052-0-47963";"I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Just the usual business of House Telvanni. Everything will be fine."
"115740052-0-47964";"They reopened the Necropolis. Now all will see how much I honor and respect my ancestors!"
"115740052-0-47965";"Right. I heard they had some sort of celebration. For some hero called the chosen of fate."
"115740052-0-47966";"Here we are. Gorne. Let's see if we can find Dreynis. Perhaps my charm will make this easy."
"115740052-0-47967";"A key? That's promising."
"115740052-0-47970";"And now you know of Hermaeus Mora's grand betrayal. Once I restore Vaermina's statue, the process of restoring the memory will begin."
"115740052-0-47971";"The Prince of Fate comes, but too late! What was shattered has been restored!"
"115740052-0-47972";"Find and activate the remaining runes, proxy."
"115740052-0-47973";"A Peryite rune, reeking of disease. Is this how they distracted the Guardian Gaze?"
"115740052-0-47974";"Look, another rune!"
"115740052-0-47975";"The Guardian appears rattled by those Peryite runes."
"115740052-0-47976";"Ah, there you are. Please tell me your search was successful, adventurer?"
"115740052-0-47977";"Another eye? It looks like all the others to me."
"115740052-0-47978";"Have faith, diseased one. This eye contains the memory of the dream we seek."
"115740052-0-47979";"Pity. She seemed so nice."
"115740052-0-47980";"We can meet afterward just outside of Arenthia, on the western bridge. It's not far from Senalana."
"115740052-0-47981";"Friend, Leramil is waiting for you in her study."
"115740052-0-47982";"Sharp! Over here."
"115740052-0-47983";"We found your flowery hideout. And we have good news."
"115740052-0-47984";"Now Hezehk relies on mortal help. What's become of me?"
"115740052-0-47985";"We've come a long way from doing jobs for House Telvanni, haven't we, Sharp?"
"115740052-0-47986";"Don't jinx it, Federo. The job's not over yet."
"115740052-0-47987";"This should be interesting. I was never allowed to visit the Tranquil Catalog before."
"115740052-0-47988";"Shrines and tears, bah! Even the tolerable Daedra rely too much on ceremony and arcane rules of conduct."
"115740052-0-47989";"That Dremora stole whatever was worth knowing here. Nothing left but the meaningless fragments. See what the Watchling makes of all this."
"115740052-0-47991";"When you're done, head south on the road from the Forgotten Crypts until you reach Narsis. We'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-47992";"You! You must fix this at once!"
"115740052-0-47993";"Sharp! At last—but you should have come alone."
"115740052-0-47995";"Neither Scruut nor I can feel Hermaeus Mora's presence. We both find this … unsettling."
"115740052-0-47996";"Kill the other one, then bring Sharp to me. We've been parted so long. I can wait a moment longer."
"115740052-0-47997";"I didn't get to see you beat the Dreamweaver? How unfair is that?"
"115740052-0-47998";"Where's the keeper? He should have been here by now."
"115740052-0-48000";"That looks like a dream crystal. Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-48001";"The Mythos appears endless, but I sense a huge concentration of corruption to the right."
"115740052-0-48003";"Blightcrown! Time to end that plague-dog, I think."
"115740052-0-48004";"Well done! Of course, it may take a week of hot baths to get his stink off you."
"115740052-0-48005";"Do you feel that? The resonance—he's really gone!"
"115740052-0-48006";"By the ancestors! That's horrible!"
"115740052-0-48007";"The power I sense up ahead … it must be Vaermina."
"115740052-0-48008";"I'll show the others the way out of here!"
"115740052-0-48009";"Head south when you reach the road. We'll meet you in Narsis."
"115740052-0-48010";"This memory is mine now, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48011";"I have wrapped it in a dream of my own creation!"
"115740052-0-48012";"If anyone could do it, it's these two right here."
"115740052-0-48013";"Kaj-kujei! I mean—Sharp. I knew you'd come back for us."
"115740052-0-48014";"I promised I would, deek-nujei. Give me a moment, I want a word with my friend."
"115740052-0-48015";"You did it? Sondivel Ulres, the Reformer—is no more?"
"115740052-0-48016";"He's dead. Burn any notes you have on his research so no one can pick up where he left off."
"115740052-0-48017";"Of course. We'll never let what happened to us happen to anyone else. Right?"
"115740052-0-48018";"I'm never giving up Reynila's work. But you have a good life ahead of you. Try living it for yourself for a while, all right?"
"115740052-0-48019";"Sharp, your memories—when he died, did anything come back to you?"
"115740052-0-48020";"No. Nothing. But it's all right. We'll make new ones."
"115740052-0-48021";"Something about this doesn't feel right."
"115740052-0-48022";"Hallgrod, my dear hireling, do not worry. Fetch my tomes, or whatever's going on in Necrom will be the least of your worries."
"115740052-0-48023";"Spellwright Moran, should we be concerned about the trouble in Necrom? They say the Necropolis is closed."
"115740052-0-48024";"Spellwright Moran, the Necropolis in Necrom has been closed. I thought you might find that interesting."
"115740052-0-48025";"What do I care about the Necropolis? Don't return until you've found that blasted tome! Do I make myself clear?"
"115740052-0-48026";"I, yes. I must have just missed it—perfectly clear, spellwright. Right away."
"115740052-0-48027";"What's your excuse this time Hallgrod? Spit it out before I have you in shackles."
"115740052-0-48028";"Spellwright Moran, mercy! A hireling told me a portal has been opened to Apocrypha! I thought you'd want to know."
"115740052-0-48029";"Fnd that tome, or I will personally see to it that you are shoved through that portal and never allowed to return again."
"115740052-0-48030";"Chosen, we must speak."
"115740052-0-48031";"I found the tome you requested, Spellwright Moran. It just a little damaged. But did you hear about the Conclave of Masters?"
"115740052-0-48032";"You just love to remind me that I'm still just a spellwright and not yet a master, don't you?"
"115740052-0-48034";"Wait, who are these people? And what are they doing to this mine?"
"115740052-0-48035";"Gods. All this destruction. All this suffering. Why are they doing this?"
"115740052-0-48036";"These cultists have done irreparable harm to this egg mine, but at least you dealt with their leader. Thank you."
"115740052-0-48037";"The trouble between Necrom and Apocrypha seems to have resolved satisfactorily. Do you think I can finally have my tome now?"
"115740052-0-48038";"Of course, spellwright. I do as I am bid. Might I hazard to ask, why was this particular tome so important?"
"115740052-0-48039";"I … ahem … require it. For my studies. I plan to petition the Telvanni Council to finally award me the rank of master and I want to be prepared."
"115740052-0-48040";"Proxy, I am glad to see you unharmed. I look forward to hearing about your encounter with Vaermina."
"115740052-0-48041";"I will have my feast!"
"115740052-0-48042";"They've torn each other apart. Look, a notice on the pen. Let's see what it says."
"115740052-0-48043";"You can't face Vaermina alone. I don't believe I'm saying this, but I'll go with you …."
"115740052-0-48044";"Ripples of agony from below. We need to go down, mortal."
"115740052-0-48046";"Which of the spumy pools should I collect this ichorous substance from? And how can I do it without getting covered in bile? Onward!"
"115740052-0-48047";"Rather strange. New faces appear but not ones I have known and not known in time. A presence beneath us shifts, a shift anew that reveals untold changes to our plane."
"115740052-0-48048";"A sour briny sea, with a smell of pungent earthy fungi. Sits heavy upon my tongue, and brings memories of a bad place."
"115740052-0-48049";"I taste the acrid tang of malice and nightmare on the wind. And a wafting stench of pestilent malignance. My spines tremble and my head swims."
"115740052-0-48050";"It has infiltrated, the waking dream. A stranger now creeps through our tomes and fates. But we will continue as is our duty, or perish as is required."
"115740052-0-48051";"This place feels ancient … like no one's been here in an eternity."
"115740052-0-48052";"The creeping nightmare seeps into our plane. It lingers at the back of my mind and floods my thoughts."
"115740052-0-48053";"Ugh, such drivel in some of these old spells."
"115740052-0-48054";"Mm- my spines feel it as well, the lingering dark is ushered in. A smell that's carried on the wind is faint but sinister."
"115740052-0-48055";"Hmm- the stench recedes and the fear falters. The taste is no more but lingers slightly on the air."
"115740052-0-48056";"The eyes still have turned to Apocrypha, not yet turned from our plane. Not yet."
"115740052-0-48057";"Yes, it is quiet, but on the air I still taste a final note. Unclear. More is to come."
"115740052-0-48058";"A lull has come. I am not convinced it will stay, but perhaps it is the beginning of the end that starts anew."
"115740052-0-48059";"Not just the Telvanni, the bandits and smugglers are getting out of hand too."
"115740052-0-48060";"He still prefers his staff. As if bludgeoning could ever compare to a blade."
"115740052-0-48061";"That man. For someone who thinks of himself as a professional, he's quite sloppy."
"115740052-0-48062";"Dark Brotherhood, indeed. Seems more like a bungle-hood if you ask me."
"115740052-0-48063";"Is that a key? While locked doors don't bother me, you're still pretty solid. I suggest you grab it."
"115740052-0-48064";"Shirking his duty, just like the port master suspected. That's why I refused to hire any assistants."
"115740052-0-48065";"A back door? Hmm. A young keeper's gateway to all kinds of mischief. There may be more to this curate than I thought."
"115740052-0-48066";"These crypts look … comfortable. I wish I'd had someone to lay my old bones to rest here."
"115740052-0-48067";"Did you hear? Elam Drals got caught … again."
"115740052-0-48068";"The same happened to me. I completed my writ before they asked."
"115740052-0-48069";"The Telvanni just can't control themselves. I've traveled to the Peninsula three times this year."
"115740052-0-48070";"I've seen. A mercenary recently wandered up to me looking for work. As if I'd ever need help."
"115740052-0-48071";"When I saw Torvesard at Tel Baro, he and Shelreni talked about a rite. What are they up to?"
"115740052-0-48072";"I take it your presence here with ale in hand means your business went as planned?"
"115740052-0-48073";"The Grandmaster's auditor still won't let me speak with him face to face."
"115740052-0-48074";"A pity. Perhaps I can put in a good word for you the next time I visit him."
"115740052-0-48075";"Still wearing those noisy boots? I see you haven't taken my advice."
"115740052-0-48076";"These? You're mistaken. The Grandmaster himself gifted them to me. They're not for work."
"115740052-0-48077";"Your life … is mine!"
"115740052-0-48078";"The audacity of that creature!"
"115740052-0-48079";"Or we could have a nice chat and discuss this like civilized people."
"115740052-0-48080";"To the Heart of the Underweave!"
"115740052-0-48082";"I hope I can honor Martina's memory, somehow. I'll see you back at Cipher's Midden."
"115740052-0-48083";"It found us. Big eyes, big arms, bigger guardian. Be careful."
"115740052-0-48084";"This is my house. Wait, where's my shoe? The Dreamcarvers stole my shoe too?"
"115740052-0-48085";"Hidden for hidings sake. Secure and secretive to secure secrets. Don't tell anyone."
"115740052-0-48086";"Book nook! Spot for Morian only. No Ciphers or eyes. Safe."
"115740052-0-48087";"Sadness in an empty shell, just like an orange peel. What happened to your fruit, friend?"
"115740052-0-48088";"Observe this thaumaturgical quadrant. Gripping the key, activate each of the beacons."
"115740052-0-48090";"The Fateweaver Key will be our guide. It should make visible the threads that bind me to the nearby frayed fate."
"115740052-0-48091";"There, a thread. Untie it, and we'll follow the thread to the next, and the next. Hah!"
"115740052-0-48092";"That thread was woven past that door!"
"115740052-0-48094";"Martina's work … my research. It's working! Smashing!"
"115740052-0-48095";"Onward and upward! As always! Hah!"
"115740052-0-48096";"I live. It is my will."
"115740052-0-48097";"Away, you pestering phantom!"
"115740052-0-48098";"Remember, you're my distraction, make a commotion in there."
"115740052-0-48099";"To the right, friend. The door to the chapel is at the end of the hall."
"115740052-0-48100";"Apocrypha, the Oblivion realm of Hermaeus Mora. In life, I came here often."
"115740052-0-48103";"Good. Nobody's noticed us so far."
"115740052-0-48104";"But we're so close!"
"115740052-0-48105";"Approach, chosen, and hear my words."
"115740052-0-48106";"Torvesard! Only one of the Unseen could evade my sight here!"
"115740052-0-48107";"Leave this memory, mortal. Take the portal and return to your allies in Cipher's Midden."
"115740052-0-48108";"What did you do, proxy? The corruption has lessened, but it persists."
"115740052-0-48109";"You destroyed one censer of corruption, but I sense more above us."
"115740052-0-48110";"Another censer destroyed. Without my ghost sight, you'd never find them."
"115740052-0-48111";"Well done! The corruption's hold weakens."
"115740052-0-48112";"That was the last censer. The corruption should clear on its own now."
"115740052-0-48113";"Whatever you just did, I sense the corruption fading away. Let us talk."
"115740052-0-48114";"Blightcrown created this corruption? With the help of Master Shelreni, Vaermina, and Peryite? We must destroy the remaining censers."
"115740052-0-48115";"That paper. See what it says, proxy."
"115740052-0-48116";"We're close. Use my ghost sight to find the source of the corruption."
"115740052-0-48117";"With the bobbin, this should be as easy as a Mages Guild theorem! Just as before, cohort, activate the beacons."
"115740052-0-48118";"Ah, there! A thread."
"115740052-0-48119";"Sobering. Hmm."
"115740052-0-48121";"Another one! I suppose it makes sense there are a few around the place where I was born."
"115740052-0-48122";"Let's talk a moment."
"115740052-0-48123";"You show the dead more respect than the living. Leave my offerings to me and get your dung-smelling incense out of my face."
"115740052-0-48124";"This is my Great Grandmother's favorite scent. See, I actually pay attention to my ancestors and don't buy whatever is popular."
"115740052-0-48125";"Very smart. Leramil's tapping into the realm's currents of fate to find the Panopticon."
"115740052-0-48126";"I know how dangerous this sort of ritual can be. Leramil's brave, I'll give her that."
"115740052-0-48127";"Yes, Meenai-Shai. They've been returned. Come, let us speak in the main hall where it is safer."
"115740052-0-48128";"Wait, I died? And you were conscious the whole time? This is a lot to take in. How long were we trapped in this cycle?"
"115740052-0-48129";"I'm unsure how long the cycle lasted. It could have been an eternity. And yes. You died. A great many times, in fact."
"115740052-0-48130";"Excellent work! Let's speak a moment, eh?"
"115740052-0-48131";"Follow me, everyone!"
"115740052-0-48132";"You! Are Mine!"
"115740052-0-48133";"After him, cohort! Into the Lost City!"
"115740052-0-48134";"I am not ready to face you. Not yet."
"115740052-0-48135";"I haven't lost anything in over two decades. The book has to be here."
"115740052-0-48136";"My book! Blast me to Oblivion. A Tomeshell? Really?"
"115740052-0-48137";"Great. How am I supposed to get you out of there without damaging the book?"
"115740052-0-48138";"This is ridiculous! Books cannot wander away. They don't have legs!"
"115740052-0-48139";"I didn't spend three days of digging just to lose it now. I will find that book, if it's the last thing I do!"
"115740052-0-48140";"Damn it! Quickly! Use the Fateweaver!"
"115740052-0-48141";"The Guardian's vision is similar to my ghost sight. Nothing escapes its notice."
"115740052-0-48142";"How clever! Activate all of the corrupted runes and we should be able to sneak past the Eye."
"115740052-0-48143";"Then let's get this over with. I can't hide us between the layers of reality much longer."
"115740052-0-48144";"Wolfsbane and Bitter Teas should be in this pile. Are you going to help me, or just watch your time drift away like usual?"
"115740052-0-48145";"Why would we be looking for a book on teas? We're here for Butterflies Among the Glade!"
"115740052-0-48146";"Give up. Your magic is no match for mine!"
"115740052-0-48147";"You think I'm afraid of your pitiful spells? Ha! I've seen more threatening netches."
"115740052-0-48149";"Let me open a portal …. There!"
"115740052-0-48150";"Dreaming … soft robes. Furrowed brows. Apostle's journal available. Talk to me while my connection is restored."
"115740052-0-48151";"Proceed carefully. Between the energy here and Blightcrown's manipulation of reality, Leramil's portal could behave erratically."
"115740052-0-48152";"I knew it! We're not where Leramil intended, and now she's missing! Spellcasting should be left to the professionals!"
"115740052-0-48153";"SAT Stinger"
"115740052-0-48154";"Finally! The Eye of Mora on the walkway above us."
"115740052-0-48155";"Every drink still has a tinge of ink to the taste …."
"115740052-0-48156";"We're in the Endless Library. This place is two thirds ink as it is!"
"115740052-0-48157";"Well if it isn't our favorite librarian! Come have a drink!"
"115740052-0-48158";"That's everything. Let's head outside. The overseer and the others should have made it out by now."
"115740052-0-48159";"The Afflicted's ichor has proven most affective. It has made short work of this egg mine."
"115740052-0-48160";"This contagion will destroy Necrom's food sources and leave them begging for Lord Peryite's mercy."
"115740052-0-48161";"I am alive. I should be dead. I need time to think all this over. Let's do as he says and go back to the brazier where you found me."
"115740052-0-48162";"I've got vague memories swimming in my mind, cohort. Let's head to the metalworks by the south gate."
"115740052-0-48163";"Aha! Fate threading, just as we saw in Kozanset. Use the Fateweaver Key and we'll follow where it leads."
"115740052-0-48164";"Too cramped. Hezehk needs space for the spell. Deeper into Forum we go!"
"115740052-0-48165";"If I learned anything as a Telvanni magister, it's this. When a Dremora tells you to go right, you go left. Let's see what this memory contains."
"115740052-0-48166";"On the bridge, another thread."
"115740052-0-48167";"A spell to make all of reality forget … I can barely imagine. Come on, we need to find Torvesard."
"115740052-0-48169";"The further west we travel the more I begin to get nervous. But why?"
"115740052-0-48171";"Ignore the soldiers. If they ask, we're just mages looking for uh. Reagents."
"115740052-0-48172";"Yech! That's why my skin is crawling. Dreugh! I hate these things."
"115740052-0-48173";"This better be it. I ran out of mold."
"115740052-0-48174";"That oaf got a far cleaner and merciful death than it deserved."
"115740052-0-48175";"A boon for knowledge. Deposit payment for assessment."
"115740052-0-48176";"Well? Do as it says."
"115740052-0-48177";"No, I do not want to hear Whim's dumb secret!"
"115740052-0-48178";"Knowledge deposited. Hold for assessment."
"115740052-0-48180";"What? It's supposed to be a secret, not a lie."
"115740052-0-48181";"Knowledge assessed and found sufficient. Accept this boon of Hermaeus Mora. Move along."
"115740052-0-48182";"It's … it's true? You get the boon, Hezehk needs to think."
"115740052-0-48183";"I think I found the secret. Follow the flare!"
"115740052-0-48184";"An untethered bone dragon? No necromancer. No ties to life or death or magic. It just … is."
"115740052-0-48185";"A collector collected by the collector? Now my mind hurts."
"115740052-0-48186";"The Lich is trying to resurrect … her. Oh, that her? The Seekers won't even name her."
"115740052-0-48187";"Glad to see you didn't stumble into a hole in reality, meddler. I know our many-eyed friend wants his glyphic back. Allow me a moment to study it, will you?"
"115740052-0-48188";"I suppose he earned a look. But only for a moment! I'd like it returned before my master realizes it's missing."
"115740052-0-48189";"Have you come seeking the wisdom of the forefathers? Then you are in the correct place."
"115740052-0-48190";"Dusksabers, here? Careful, proxy. These vampire mercenaries opposed us when we searched for the Emerald Glyphic."
"115740052-0-48191";"Well done. And Master Shelreni always says good help is hard to find."
"115740052-0-48192";"I don't like that glow. Leave it."
"115740052-0-48193";"By Vaermina!"
"115740052-0-48194";"Don't be a coward. It's just a book."
"115740052-0-48195";"What's this? It looks like Mouth Delvi's left some incriminating documents on their desk for anyone to see. How foolish of them."
"115740052-0-48197";"Grey Horse, or Dead Host? Alive and trapped … stuck more than most."
"115740052-0-48198";"Watcher's whiskers …. What was that?"
"115740052-0-48199";"No, Vabdru. As Master Shelreni's mouth, you are prohibited from entering the conclave."
"115740052-0-48200";"Wait, hold on! Headed to Ald Isra?"
"115740052-0-48201";"But, but … I must warn the masters!"
"115740052-0-48202";"Don't worry, your treacherous master will be dealt with soon enough."
"115740052-0-48203";"Just come back here when you're done. I'll be here … tinkering on the tincture!"
"115740052-0-48204";"There. Let's see what my spell found."
"115740052-0-48205";"Finished reading? Let's talk."
"115740052-0-48206";"We need to get out of here."
"115740052-0-48207";"I insist, curate. You do realize I wield considerable influence as Master Norvora's mouth?"
"115740052-0-48208";"Of course, but …."
"115740052-0-48209";"I could do much for you and the keepers. Now, tell me. What you think of my book?"
"115740052-0-48210";"Really, I must …."
"115740052-0-48211";"Thank you, my friend. Follow me. I know a place where we can talk privately."
"115740052-0-48213";"Yes … it's working. My soul will soon be free of this failing flesh …."
"115740052-0-48214";"Leave me be, stranger! This is no concern of yours. Go!"
"115740052-0-48215";"No! No! I'm not finished! I'm … not …."
"115740052-0-48216";"What's useful to you is useful to the Morag Tong. Or are you through with the whole idea?"
"115740052-0-48217";"Cruel, even for you. It was never that I needed one. She just seemed useful."
"115740052-0-48218";"I'm quite fine on my own. No need for a moppet to follow me around."
"115740052-0-48219";"No new apprentice?"
"115740052-0-48220";"A ward needs anchors. Use my ghost sight to spot them."
"115740052-0-48221";"Stop complaining, Llaro. Your headaches are no excuse for poor results. You are of House Telvanni. Find a remedy and press on."
"115740052-0-48222";"See them? One on either side of the door? I'll lend you my power to disable them."
"115740052-0-48223";"Magister Gothren is good, but I'm better! Let's enter the assembly hall."
"115740052-0-48224";"Can I get you anything, Leramil?"
"115740052-0-48225";"No thank you, Gadayn. I am mostly recovered from our ordeal."
"115740052-0-48226";"This is a closed session! What is the meaning of this intrusion?"
"115740052-0-48227";"Now, Gothren, surely such restrictions don't apply to a magister and his proxy."
"115740052-0-48228";"Meln the Mouthless, a spirit? No matter, I will not tolerate your antics …."
"115740052-0-48229";"Nothing in our statutes precludes a dead magister from participating in a conclave. Now, hear what my proxy has to say."
"115740052-0-48230";"Very well. Step forward."
"115740052-0-48231";"Have you heard? Necrom Abbey will soon reopen!"
"115740052-0-48232";"Truly? That's good to hear. The necropolis is the heart of the city."
"115740052-0-48233";"There's a meeting room just to the right."
"115740052-0-48234";"This must be where they're holding her."
"115740052-0-48235";"Shelreni's gone, but what's that tipped over bottle over there?"
"115740052-0-48236";"That's pure essence of dream. Let me cast a spell to see what happened here."
"115740052-0-48237";"What … what was that?"
"115740052-0-48238";"Just a little gift from the Prince of Dreams. Soon you will do exactly as I say."
"115740052-0-48239";"We must get to the conclave! It's held in the masters' private hall to the north."
"115740052-0-48240";"You … you won't get away with this."
"115740052-0-48241";"I already have. And with your help, I'll get away with so much more."
"115740052-0-48242";"Now let's go attend the conclave. My ascension requires participants—willing or otherwise."
"115740052-0-48243";"Good. And now …."
"115740052-0-48245";"You should be able to see my sigils through my ghost sight. Look around."
"115740052-0-48246";"For the Prince of Dreams and Nightmares!"
"115740052-0-48247";"Destroy the heretics!"
"115740052-0-48248";"Do you have any idea how long I've waited to take my revenge? No? I'll gladly show you!"
"115740052-0-48249";"You ruined my chance to get revenge."
"115740052-0-48250";"""You can't punish someone for something they might possibly do."""
"115740052-0-48252";"Almost done. Now sprinkle the tincture."
"115740052-0-48253";"Good work. Now place the shawl."
"115740052-0-48254";"Excellent! Now take the cloak of omission."
"115740052-0-48255";"You look amazing! Barely a hint of a Daedric connection. I should explain the particulars though."
"115740052-0-48256";"Look! Is that one of my frayed fates on the ground?"
"115740052-0-48257";"Sondivel Ulres, Reformer, whatever you call yourself—you should have run."
"115740052-0-48258";"I don't want to hurt you, Sharp!"
"115740052-0-48259";"Such a poor use of your potential."
"115740052-0-48260";"What's the matter? This isn't how you imagined our reunion?"
"115740052-0-48261";"Wait! If you kill me, you'll never get your memories back!"
"115740052-0-48262";"Smash it. Burn it all. Sondivel's work dies with him. Everyone else walks free."
"115740052-0-48263";"Come, fool of fate, face Peryite's high priest of plague!"
"115740052-0-48264";"I need power! What harms Apocrypha makes me stronger!"
"115740052-0-48265";"Disturbing. Ominous!"
"115740052-0-48266";"Oathman! Well, if you say so, Spellwright! I promise to bring pride and glory to House Telvanni!"
"115740052-0-48267";"Cease this needless posturing, Llaro. Deal with this and be done with it."
"115740052-0-48268";"Right, right, I'll deal with it Spellwright. But allow me some time to savor the moment."
"115740052-0-48269";"Best of luck. To both of us."
"115740052-0-48270";"There, a tomeshell has the text! Get after it, the chase is on!"
"115740052-0-48271";"That portal. Vaermina passed through it, mortal."
"115740052-0-48272";"Aha! The book we need is in that pile."
"115740052-0-48273";"Blightcrown! Did he say something about an Eye of Mora?"
"115740052-0-48274";"There's Blightcrown! And he has my relic!"
"115740052-0-48275";"Blightcrown has the Fulcrum Obscura!"
"115740052-0-48276";"There! Another fate. Drained and lingering. Use the Fateweaver Key, if you please."
"115740052-0-48277";"Surely a man of your talents can grow more? Now, move. Others wait in need of my counsel."
"115740052-0-48278";"Please, Harn. They're not just flowers, they're—"
"115740052-0-48279";"You can't just go making claims about this cordial, Menredius. It has to actually work."
"115740052-0-48280";"I'll try using columbine flowers in the next batch. I'll just need to find a steady supply. You'll get a return on your investment soon, Harn. I promise!"
"115740052-0-48281";"Leramil the Wise? You know this mortal, too? Then understand that agents of Vaermina invaded my master's realm."
"115740052-0-48282";"Ah, one of Hermaeus Mora's examiners of contradictions. Reality is in jeopardy, Watchling. We can use every ally we can get."
"115740052-0-48283";"Finally! Now I'll know the truth. The real truth!"
"115740052-0-48284";"At one point I seriously considered investigating the mystery of the Dwemer. I decided against it after meeting other researchers in the field. What a ponderous lot!"
"115740052-0-48285";"I'd forgotten how vast this complex can feel. Designed to intimidate, certainly, but also a practicality. Can you imagine the scale of the mechanisms behind those walls?"
"115740052-0-48286";"Watch those traps, cohort. Even if they are fairly unsophisticated."
"115740052-0-48287";"The chamber's not too far now. Hopefully we can discover the adversary's goal before he achieves it."
"115740052-0-48288";"It will take all of us to reach the Mythos. Allow me to ease the suffering of your allies."
"115740052-0-48289";"And they helped me! Break barriers, know things, and escape! Escape? Who? Shh!"
"115740052-0-48290";"He's here! We've got him!"
"115740052-0-48291";"They assisted me with the Fateweaver experiment!"
"115740052-0-48292";"The cultists are spreading Blightcrown's corruption."
"115740052-0-48293";"Torvesard, take the Dream Prince into the Eye of Mora and find your memory."
"115740052-0-48294";"I have a final gift to deliver to the very core of Apocrypha!"
"115740052-0-48295";"The combination of rite and concoction works splendidly! We are hidden and Mora suffers."
"115740052-0-48296";"Chosen of fate, speak with me."
"115740052-0-48297";"Amazing. I can't believe everything you accomplished!"
"115740052-0-48298";"Outrageous! How dare you—"
"115740052-0-48299";"Amazing. You're a beacon for the lost souls of this realm."
"115740052-0-48300";"No, Sulis, I'm out of patience. We need this finished. Now."
"115740052-0-48301";"Well. Unlike Foves, I am at your service should you require anything."
"115740052-0-48302";"I'll be fine, use the key! Cut him off from the fates!"
"115740052-0-48303";"I call forth all whose fates are intertwined with yours, chosen. Only together can you save reality."
"115740052-0-48304";"Have I mentioned how much I detest teleportation?"
"115740052-0-48305";"You certainly do tend to collect an odd assortment of companions."
"115740052-0-48307";"Get to Tel Huulen. I'll draw off my pursuers."
"115740052-0-48308";"Empty. Empty. So quiet. Where are we?"
"115740052-0-48309";"Damn it. Let's get out of here and talk."
"115740052-0-48310";"Thank the Tides! The vessels in this room seem largely intact."
"115740052-0-48311";"What's happening to that vessel? Quickly, reset the magicka focus!"
"115740052-0-48312";"There! Another one speaks!"
"115740052-0-48313";"By the tides! The vessels writhe like worms on a hook. Like before—reset the focus!"
"115740052-0-48314";"There. That's the somnambulum. I'll prepare it for you."
"115740052-0-48315";"There you are! I pray this isn't too disorienting? Let's discuss our next move."
"115740052-0-48316";"There's a kagouti nest just up ahead. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-48317";"Be cautious. The chorus' mind-sentinels will see you as an intruder. Stand ready to defend yourself, yes?"
"115740052-0-48318";"Mortal, we need to talk."
"115740052-0-48321";"Damn it, Folsi! I told you to be careful. I hate losing a good associate."
"115740052-0-48322";"I have nothing to say to you, friend of the dark lady."
"115740052-0-48323";"There! This is our pact, yes? Have a look. It might tell us something about our quarry."
"115740052-0-48324";"Did you see that woman outside? If looks could kill, she wouldn't need those knives."
"115740052-0-48325";"Isn't Blightcrown brilliant? Those fools at the Necropolis actually believe he's a Temple prelate!"
"115740052-0-48326";"Shh! She asked about her assistant. Just keep your head down."
"115740052-0-48327";"Joining the Hidden Kindred was the best decision I ever made."
"115740052-0-48328";"What a disaster! Huzmargo hopes the vessels remain intact."
"115740052-0-48329";"Meet me in Tel Huulen. We can finish this there."
"115740052-0-48330";"The Daggerfall Devil?"
"115740052-0-48331";"Fate's champions pursue us, Blightcrown. Deal with them while I locate the glyphics."
"115740052-0-48332";"Oh, my manufactories of corruption will keep them busy, Prince Vaermina."
"115740052-0-48333";"Disable Blightcrown's manufactories and the corruption will dissipate. Just shatter the dream crystal that binds them to the Mythos."
"115740052-0-48334";"Save Apocrypha while I pursue Vaermina."
"115740052-0-48335";"Come, Gadayn. We'll take the west portal and leave the east to Leramil and fate's chosen."
"115740052-0-48336";"Good thinking, Scruut. This way, proxy."
"115740052-0-48337";"My father … gone. I have no words. I am grateful for your assistance traveler. Please, leave me with my grief."
"115740052-0-48338";"May the Three bless you, my friend."
"115740052-0-48341";"Not so tough now, are you?"
"115740052-0-48342";"The adversary was just here, we can track him! I'm constructing a rune of seeking."
"115740052-0-48345";"Damn you, Mora! We must slip away while we can, Torvesard."
"115740052-0-48346";"Hah! There, a thread. And are those Sea Elves? Damned pirates."
"115740052-0-48347";"Talk? To me? I—of course. Go on, friend. I'll see you soon."
"115740052-0-48349";"This edifice of corruption has been dealt with. Let us traverse to the western side."
"115740052-0-48350";"Look to the west. What do you see?"
"115740052-0-48351";"Stay sharp. Dimik-ei's counting on us."
"115740052-0-48352";"Outworlder, we need you."
"115740052-0-48353";"Oh! Over here! Help me tame this alit!"
"115740052-0-48354";"I always wanted one as a pet, but my family said they're too dangerous."
"115740052-0-48355";"They love eating, but … I forgot what their favorite food is."
"115740052-0-48356";"I brought a sweet Torchbug Treacle, and a sour Scrib-Jelly Sujamma. Ooh! Why don't you help me choose!"
"115740052-0-48357";"Here, my toothy friend! I've got a sweet treat for you!"
"115740052-0-48358";"Here, my toothy friend! This sour delight is just for you!"
"115740052-0-48359";"Hey, hero. Find anything pertinent to my writ?"
"115740052-0-48360";"Over here, hero. Got anything interesting for me?"
"115740052-0-48361";"It looks like … he likes it!"
"115740052-0-48362";"Would you like to be my friend? I can give you more treats!"
"115740052-0-48363";"This is excellent! I'm going to take such good care of you!"
"115740052-0-48364";"I'd never have gotten it right on my own. In the name of the Three, I won't forget you."
"115740052-0-48365";"We haven't found Reynila's body yet, at least."
"115740052-0-48366";"I think we're on the right track. Just a little further."
"115740052-0-48367";"Mortal, why do you bear the mark of the Great Eye?"
"115740052-0-48368";"B'vek! I had a premonition last night that Azandar would darken my door. Or, possibly, I had terrible gas. Unpleasant either way."
"115740052-0-48369";"And you're still a pompous arse that uses ten coin words when one will do. I'll summon this, and then you two get gone."
"115740052-0-48370";"Uh oh. Maybe he actually has a sweet tooth."
"115740052-0-48372";"Azandar al-Cybiades! Last time I saw you, you threw an aetheric construct at the High Astrologer's head."
"115740052-0-48374";"Blightcrown must have shattered the path."
"115740052-0-48375";"Simple enough to rectify …."
"115740052-0-48376";"There!"
"115740052-0-48377";"That … took more out of me than I expected. Follow the path, proxy. I sense something has gone awry."
"115740052-0-48378";"Hah! I'd forgotten that! It was the only way to get through to that simpleton. Coincidentally, if you believe in such things, I have need of that rubric. Any chance it's still around?"
"115740052-0-48379";"I think the treacle was a little too sweet."
"115740052-0-48383";"The Star-Gazers are just mages with a fancy name. Which means they're hopefully still hanging onto that old rubric."
"115740052-0-48384";"So now you know, Sulis. Well, good for you. That and a few coins will get you a ride on a silt strider."
"115740052-0-48385";"Then, this is over, Tredecim."
"115740052-0-48386";"Please! I'm just a hireling! I did what I was told!"
"115740052-0-48387";"If you're certain, assassin, then do as you will."
"115740052-0-48388";"No! You'll have to catch me first!"
"115740052-0-48389";"Help is so difficult to come by. Pity you had to kill one of the good ones."
"115740052-0-48390";"I see you're still holding onto these mephitic notions of victimhood, Nilvon."
"115740052-0-48392";"For whatever it's worth, Nilvon, I'm sorry that things ended so badly between us. This stone is in excellent shape. Thank you."
"115740052-0-48393";"Interesting. Let's talk where there's some fresh air."
"115740052-0-48394";"Well, well, well. Looked what the senche dragged in."
"115740052-0-48395";"Cohort, would you mind speaking with her? Erm. Please?"
"115740052-0-48396";"Ahem, hello Elydrina. Some time ago, I behaved rather boorishly to you. So …."
"115740052-0-48397";"That's your best effort? You never found a book on apologizing in the great libraries of Apocrypha?"
"115740052-0-48398";"I'm sorry, I reacted badly to perceived criticism. I insulted you, ignoring the time and effort you put into reading and responding to my work. Tossing your work aside as I did was inexcusable. And I apologize."
"115740052-0-48400";"Well mercy mother preserve me. Thank you, Azandar. Apology accepted. My copy's on the lower shelf on the far wall. Good luck, with whatever you're into."
"115740052-0-48401";"Lord Peryite! Grant your blessing to your loyal servant!"
"115740052-0-48402";"Receive the gift of Peryite!"
"115740052-0-48403";"No, not yet! Lord of Pestilence, aid me!"
"115740052-0-48404";"Come, pilgrims! Bear witness to the Taskmaster's works!"
"115740052-0-48405";"Foolish mortal. There is no waking from eternal nightmare!"
"115740052-0-48406";"I suggest we try the main building. If there's a copy of Nathriin's Commentaries left, it will be there."
"115740052-0-48407";"Here comes fate's chosen. Probably going to gloat."
"115740052-0-48408";"Over here! We could use some help! But where's Leramil?"
"115740052-0-48409";"You must stop this at once! I'm so close to ascending from this old flesh."
"115740052-0-48410";"Thank goodness you showed up. We were set upon as soon as we arrived."
"115740052-0-48411";"We never reached the manufactory. The way is blocked. Let me summon a portal."
"115740052-0-48412";"Ugh … I'm exhausted! Here comes Leramil. You and Gadayn go on ahead. I'll stay with her."
"115740052-0-48413";"Walk casually, just mages here on mage business. There's a trap door to the basement."
"115740052-0-48414";"You already destroyed one of these manufactories? Then you know what to look for."
"115740052-0-48415";"Follow. We must think."
"115740052-0-48416";"You there! I have a message for you."
"115740052-0-48417";"<Clears throat.>"
"115740052-0-48418";"<Speaking in gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-48419";"<Emphatically speaking in gibberish.>"
"115740052-0-48420";"Hmm, no, that wasn't right …."
"115740052-0-48422";"Nicely done, but don't get complacent. I sense another of these vile contraptions nearby."
"115740052-0-48423";"It understands me! I mean, of course it understands me. Why would it not?"
"115740052-0-48424";"Join me. Quickly now! Before the little one gets self-conscious."
"115740052-0-48425";"You only delay my escape from this cycle. I will be free from it!"
"115740052-0-48426";"I'll return to Apocrypha. See if I can find Vaermina while you chase spirits. Not like I've got anything better to do."
"115740052-0-48427";"Good luck at Tel Baro, my friends. Return here with whatever you learn."
"115740052-0-48428";"I failed you my prince. Mora's secrets remain sealed away."
"115740052-0-48429";"No time for niceties. We summon Tem, the Omen of Destiny. Come before us!"
"115740052-0-48430";"I bind myself in contract with you, Omen. Future payment in trade for your aid today."
"115740052-0-48431";"Tem is summoned! Your contract is acceptable, arcanist. Ask your questions."
"115740052-0-48432";"Yes, that's it! Let's see you dance."
"115740052-0-48433";"Wait, what? What's going on?"
"115740052-0-48434";"<Screaming.>"
"115740052-0-48436";"The past acts as an anchor, strength for this thing that should not be. Are you sure you wish your creation destroyed?"
"115740052-0-48438";"If you won't listen to me, perhaps my guardian will compel you to turn back!"
"115740052-0-48439";"I hold totems of my past, and no question but one: will you consume these anchors to create a Runeform of Unmaking? To end my adversary?"
"115740052-0-48440";"I can't believe the Necropolis turned us away!"
"115740052-0-48441";"That is not real! Don't-don't-don't you dare run away! I am surrounded by cowards."
"115740052-0-48442";"The Fulcrum Obscura, just as Torvesard said! Now I can return it to the abbey."
"115740052-0-48443";"Careful, my friend."
"115740052-0-48444";"Look, Leramil! We found them!"
"115740052-0-48445";"When you are ready, proxy, this portal shall take you to Vaermina."
"115740052-0-48446";"Leramil! Thank the ancestors you're all right!"
"115740052-0-48447";"Just as he said, place the items in the apocryphal fire."
"115740052-0-48448";"There's the main tower. And you can see the isolation tower to the north, there."
"115740052-0-48449";"They're not like the towers back home, but they're beautiful in their own way."
"115740052-0-48450";"Eternal disappointment, more likely!"
"115740052-0-48451";"This is it. Let's return to my sanctum, scry for the adversary. And end this!"
"115740052-0-48452";"Let's return to Necrom and tell Leramil what we learned."
"115740052-0-48453";"Got it? Let's speak for a moment."
"115740052-0-48454";"I don't think I've ever seen it this empty down here. Where is everyone?"
"115740052-0-48456";"What's that? It looks like a letter."
"115740052-0-48457";"Fantastic! You're very light on your feet."
"115740052-0-48458";"Look. Look! It's going to dance!"
"115740052-0-48459";"By the Divines. Look at that!"
"115740052-0-48461";"Almost … got it …."
"115740052-0-48462";"The Dreamweaver flees, but what of the glyphic vault?"
"115740052-0-48463";"I am so close to my goal, you must stop this madness now!"
"115740052-0-48465";"The passage should be accessible from one of the rear chambers. Keep an eye out for a door of ancient elven style."
"115740052-0-48466";"Incredible! Come my newly-formed Imp troop, we must show your talents to others!"
"115740052-0-48467";"Farewell, adventurer! And be sure to tell the tale of Oritius the Imp-Singer!"
"115740052-0-48468";"I will convey your message, mortal wizard. Now, I have my own preparations to make."
"115740052-0-48469";"Rather than wander this maze, let's make use of my rune of searching again. Incantus Eruditum!"
"115740052-0-48471";"Ah! There. On the ledge."
"115740052-0-48472";"Our fate arrived. We have fallen."
"115740052-0-48474";"Three take you, you pretentious fetcher. Onwards and get out of here."
"115740052-0-48476";"I am here, chosen. Unleash my power as you will!"
"115740052-0-48477";"I will unlock this glyphic and recover the second part of the lost memory!"
"115740052-0-48478";"Really? They helped me recover an important glyphic!"
"115740052-0-48480";"Over there, half covered in vines! There's the door."
"115740052-0-48481";"They even turned my failure of a brother back to normal after he transformed himself into a book!"
"115740052-0-48482";"Many great works from our Apogee of the Tormenting Eye were rescued by this mortal."
"115740052-0-48483";"The grave-singer delivers the final song. See here? Tales of Deeta-Tol's bountiful spirit are carved into the wood."
"115740052-0-48484";"We all seek to return to the Hist. In staking our dead, we ensure they never return as a bog blight."
"115740052-0-48485";"My people hope to guide our dead back to the ash."
"115740052-0-48489";"Th- three Hermaeus Moras?"
"115740052-0-48490";"You will beg me to kill you, mortal."
"115740052-0-48491";"Stop clinging to a dead order. We must accept our fate."
"115740052-0-48492";"This mortal can change our fate. Stay here. Tend to the stricken."
"115740052-0-48493";"Vaermina's nightmares fight beside me, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48494";"You survived? Perhaps this will be a challenge after all."
"115740052-0-48495";"Let us see how you handle a night terror!"
"115740052-0-48496";"Oh, let me! We defeated Vaermina!"
"115740052-0-48497";"Impossible! No mortal can best me!"
"115740052-0-48498";"So we can relax now? Ah, friend? You have that look. What terrible news are you about to tell Leramil?"
"115740052-0-48499";"Must've been something you said to him, mortal."
"115740052-0-48500";"You saved my life! Next time, I'll keep an eye out for cliff striders."
"115740052-0-48501";"Maybe he doesn't know his own strength!"
"115740052-0-48502";"No! Where'd he go?"
"115740052-0-48503";"I'll find him again, don't worry. Where am I?"
"115740052-0-48504";"Ahh!"
"115740052-0-48505";"Help! Someone. Anyone!"
"115740052-0-48506";"I will remember you, mortal …."
"115740052-0-48507";"This Dreamcarver spell opens a void in our thoughts. It feels like an erasure."
"115740052-0-48508";"Torvesard tells me fate chose you. Well, he chose poorly. Time to die, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48509";"Closer, mortal! A smack from fate's tentacle can free you!"
"115740052-0-48510";"Let me hit you with a tentacle, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48511";"Only a monster would ignore my warnings! I won't let you take me today!"
"115740052-0-48513";"Burn it out, cohort. Hold the Fateweaver Key in the magicka font until it bursts. It's the only way to sever his connection to my fateline."
"115740052-0-48514";"Step through the portal, if you would. I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-48515";"I need you to throw the key from the cliff's edge into the sea. If we don't, I'll always be tempted to repair it."
"115740052-0-48517";"Fate's chosen cleansed Quires Wind when madness was set loose in the stacks!"
"115740052-0-48518";"They recovered the Numinous Grimoire and brought a murderer to justice. Every cipher is safer now."
"115740052-0-48520";"What did you do? He's gone. Gone!"
"115740052-0-48521";"No. He can't be—not from something so weak. He must have gone … somewhere else."
"115740052-0-48523";"I must find him again! But not you, mortal. You stay far away."
"115740052-0-48524";"I'll go this way. Or was it that way?"
"115740052-0-48525";"Here's where those thieves ambushed me!"
"115740052-0-48526";"I see my mirror! Could be a trap. You get it."
"115740052-0-48527";"Here. A node of power for the traps. Help us recharge it."
"115740052-0-48528";"Come, we can recharge this power node."
"115740052-0-48529";"A power node. Let us charge it."
"115740052-0-48530";"That covers our exits. Let us talk about next steps."
"115740052-0-48532";"Remnants function as a whole. Why isolate us?"
"115740052-0-48533";"Fragments of ritual medium. We can learn from that."
"115740052-0-48534";"That is the ritual's core. Her own essence."
"115740052-0-48536";"Another ritual focus. Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-48537";"Destroy the ritual! Sever the connection!"
"115740052-0-48539";"You! Our pact with Lord Mora is sacred. Do not dare enter the Crux."
"115740052-0-48540";"Despite your efforts, I have what I need. Good try, though."
"115740052-0-48541";"Quick, we need to plan."
"115740052-0-48542";"Well done. Now we go to the ritual dais."
"115740052-0-48543";"Here. We will guide you through the next steps."
"115740052-0-48544";"We opened the way. Enter the Crux, outworlder."
"115740052-0-48545";"The Crux. Wait … our connection. We have gone silent."
"115740052-0-48546";"She is right. It is empty. Except for this."
"115740052-0-48547";"What does this mean, mortal?"
"115740052-0-48548";"We need your guidance."
"115740052-0-48549";"I will admit to a touch of … melancholy, I suppose. Much study and work went into my creation. Still, it was the right thing to do."
"115740052-0-48550";"Come! Test your mettle against my menagerie! The finest fighting specimens from across the world!"
"115740052-0-48551";"Bear witness to my mighty menagerie! My people have traveled the world to bring you the most exciting threats to battle!"
"115740052-0-48552";"At last, some challengers! Let me whet your combat palette with a selection of dangerous wildlife, secured at great risk!"
"115740052-0-48553";"Good, good! I see you're warmed up. Mindless beasts are one thing, but how will you fare against something more … intelligent?"
"115740052-0-48554";"Fascinating! I may have to add you into my collection, before you can cause any more damage!"
"115740052-0-48555";"You've beaten my behemoth! Do you have any idea how expensive those creatures are to maintain?"
"115740052-0-48556";"Hezehk is my most invaluable servant. Much of my power comes from his skill. Without him, I would be lost."
"115740052-0-48558";"Just follow where it leads, cohort. And don't worry about getting waylaid. It will wait for us."
"115740052-0-48559";"I need to find someone to look into this. But who?"
"115740052-0-48560";"Torvesard got the better of us, but we are not finished yet."
"115740052-0-48562";"Place the relics while we channel our power through them."
"115740052-0-48563";"Be careful. Dreamcarvers and Hidden Kindred lurk around every corner."
"115740052-0-48564";"Never did like Spider Daedra. Cruel and deceitful creatures. I'm not surprised to find them among the Dreamcarvers."
"115740052-0-48565";"Ugh. More of the invaders! It will take forever to put the Catalog back in order."
"115740052-0-48566";"The Tormenting Eye? That's one of my master's Black Books."
"115740052-0-48567";"The Pact Primordial prohibits Daedric Princes from entering another's realm, but that's hardly a secret."
"115740052-0-48568";"Torvesard said he was trying to remember a lost dream. He believes he can find it in my master's realm."
"115740052-0-48569";"This is for everyone I'll never remember because of you."
"115740052-0-48570";"Well, you don't look like much to me!"
"115740052-0-48571";"Surrender, and I'll go easy on your friend here!"
"115740052-0-48572";"I always liked cats better than you lizards!"
"115740052-0-48573";"You're the lizard Sondivel's so obsessed with, aren't you?"
"115740052-0-48574";"Inky-black and wriggling. Just like I always thought it would be. I never got this far before fear took me."
"115740052-0-48575";"Who forbids these exhibits? What's down here? Come on. Let's look!"
"115740052-0-48576";"Get it off! Help! Please!"
"115740052-0-48579";"It looks like a map? How about you take that, friend! I'll just follow Vorm!"
"115740052-0-48580";"That's that! We'll meet you inside!"
"115740052-0-48583";"Not bad, not bad. But without my ghost sight, you probably wouldn't have survived that."
"115740052-0-48584";"You're as transparent as I am! And look, there's Torvesard!"
"115740052-0-48585";"No matter what we encounter, remember you literally have a Telvanni magister in your pocket."
"115740052-0-48586";"What's going on with the Stormwing? Nobody wants to go near that ship."
"115740052-0-48587";"Good question. I hear it's full of skeevers and it arrived with a prelate from the Temple."
"115740052-0-48588";"Interesting. No one's gone near it since the Temple priests disembarked. Not even a rat."
"115740052-0-48589";"Mora's minions! You will not interfere!"
"115740052-0-48590";"Probably cultists of some sort. That's my guess, anyway."
"115740052-0-48591";"We are not finished yet, proxy."
"115740052-0-48592";"You don't think the ship is haunted, do you? Haunted and cursed?"
"115740052-0-48593";"Until we know what's going on, I'm giving that ship a wide berth."
"115740052-0-48594";"I'll go with you. It's not like I have anywhere else to be."
"115740052-0-48595";"No! You will not stop me from getting out!"
"115740052-0-48596";"You're weak, like all the rest!"
"115740052-0-48597";"You're not the first to try and stop me!"
"115740052-0-48598";"This will not be my end!"
"115740052-0-48601";"It rushed to attack and then just froze in place. I think it's sick."
"115740052-0-48602";"Prepare yourself for the wonder of knowledge unknown! Now, let's see …."
"115740052-0-48603";"One of Blightcrown's censers! And not even hidden. Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-48604";"Let's return to Leramil's study and tell her what we found."
"115740052-0-48605";"What nightmare can I draw from your darkest dreams?"
"115740052-0-48606";"Ah, what perfect terror!"
"115740052-0-48607";"Your nightmare will never end, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48608";"The more you struggle, the faster you lose!"
"115740052-0-48609";"Curate Gadayn asked me to watch for you. He's waiting for you through the door to the east."
"115740052-0-48610";"Without Shelreni's body, Vaermina takes on a more nightmarish form."
"115740052-0-48611";"That's her weakness. Nightmares aren't real!"
"115740052-0-48613";"You're stronger than her dreamstuff!"
"115740052-0-48614";"All right, you win. I saw Wolfhound and Sea Breeze in the last stack we searched."
"115740052-0-48615";"Finally came to your senses? Good. Let's go."
"115740052-0-48616";"Nice little place right on the water, and get this—Federo doesn't even like to fish. What a waste."
"115740052-0-48617";"The book! What's happening!?"
"115740052-0-48618";"The magisters warned us! Knowledge taken from Hermaeus Mora always has a cost. You! Help us break this curse!"
"115740052-0-48619";"I may have switched the titles of the books in my mind. Butterflies in the Glade, yet?"
"115740052-0-48620";"Really? All right. I think my book's over this way."
"115740052-0-48621";"It worked. I wasn't sure it would!"
"115740052-0-48623";"Nicely done! Now let's return to Leramil and see if everything aligned correctly."
"115740052-0-48624";"Well done. Now out to the courtyard—we'll meet in the Heart of Underweave!"
"115740052-0-48625";"Ogle has a bad feeling about this."
"115740052-0-48626";"We must find Shelreni and stop her from completing this rite."
"115740052-0-48627";"My Black Book! Looks like Shelreni got past my safeguards."
"115740052-0-48628";"Yes, yes! No time to waste, no time to waste!"
"115740052-0-48629";"Proxy, a word?"
"115740052-0-48630";"Blightcrown's vile monstrosity! No wonder Apocrypha suffers!"
"115740052-0-48631";"Why, yes, that was me who realigned the path for you. Thanks for asking."
"115740052-0-48632";"My crew will rig the mast with your entrails. Get up, boys. Time to earn your keep!"
"115740052-0-48633";"Let me fix that complexion for you!"
"115740052-0-48634";"Think you can compete with my awesome power?"
"115740052-0-48635";"Huh?"
"115740052-0-48636";"Ha! I don't think anyone would have trouble competing against that."
"115740052-0-48637";"What's this? Who disturbs Captain Blackheart at his rest?\n\nCome a long way to die."
"115740052-0-48638";"This is only a fraction of my true power. Be grateful it isn't the whole of it."
"115740052-0-48639";"Large spells take too long to cast."
"115740052-0-48640";"This portal will return you to Necrom, proxy."
"115740052-0-48641";"These ruins are not extensive. Stay alert for more threads of fate."
"115740052-0-48643";"Another thread. I knew it. My Fateweaver Key is amazing."
"115740052-0-48644";"You cheat! Let me go, I'll show you real magic."
"115740052-0-48645";"Thank you for speaking with Ri'zaaddru. This one must ensure the esteemed Falso Hleran's beloved Nervania also receives funerary rites at his side. This can be arranged?"
"115740052-0-48646";"Certainly. It's set for tomorrow. Adding his beloved isn't a problem. Were they married?"
"115740052-0-48647";"Ah, well, Ri'zaaddru thinks not. Nervania was his favorite guar."
"115740052-0-48648";"Oh, I see. That is unusual. Do you have something in writing? A formal request from the family?"
"115740052-0-48649";"Hmm … perhaps when Ri'zaaddru talks to the family tomorrow, he can ask them for this consideration. Thank you for your time, Keeper Drarayne."
"115740052-0-48650";"The entrance to the old ruins are just up this way. I remember it like it was yesterday."
"115740052-0-48651";"I've failed … my duty."
"115740052-0-48652";"We need a boom! Tell the spider you're sorry and take the thing on its back. Its inkwell!"
"115740052-0-48653";"This can't be good."
"115740052-0-48654";"Good work! Pour the ichor on the gate to open the way to Bastion Nymic."
"115740052-0-48655";"Yes, this feels right. I went off exploring on my own every chance I could. You understand."
"115740052-0-48656";"Henchmen! To battle!"
"115740052-0-48657";"Gubbins has prepared the inner sanctum for us. Let's head inside."
"115740052-0-48658";"Psst, over here!"
"115740052-0-48659";"Sister, the pages! The curse scattered them to the winds! Father can wait, we have to collect the pages!"
"115740052-0-48660";"We should talk, mouth of Meln."
"115740052-0-48661";"An aspect of Vaermina? That's not good."
"115740052-0-48662";"Hold still and I'll open a portal back to Necrom."
"115740052-0-48664";"Another thread, there, at the apex of the ruins!"
"115740052-0-48665";"Come, proxy. Fate dictates that I join you at this location."
"115740052-0-48667";"Nchuleftingth! Of course! The third image from our scrying was Nchuleftingth."
"115740052-0-48668";"Find the relics. Hurry."
"115740052-0-48669";"What? Never seen an assassin get put out of work before?"
"115740052-0-48670";"Almost there. Help me align the portal, proxy."
"115740052-0-48671";"Go on ahead. I'll meet up with you soon."
"115740052-0-48672";"The way into the Mythos is opened."
"115740052-0-48673";"I know that fetcher's here somewhere. Let's see if we can draw him out."
"115740052-0-48674";"Sharp? Help us, please!"
"115740052-0-48675";"We'll see what you can do when you can't even open your eyes."
"115740052-0-48676";"Very good, walker! Very good."
"115740052-0-48677";"No, no, no! How did he know?"
"115740052-0-48678";"Master Marena seemed exhausted. Is she well?"
"115740052-0-48679";"The healers recommended she stay in bed, but she insisted we attend the conclave. They call them so rarely, you know."
"115740052-0-48680";"Understandable. As much as our masters despise public appearances, they hate the thought of others gathering without them more."
"115740052-0-48681";"Too bad we're not allowed inside. I was hoping to see what punishment they devise for Master Shelreni."
"115740052-0-48682";"Use my ghost sight to disable the wards and get down there!"
"115740052-0-48683";"Shh! Dreams are unstable things right at the start. Check inside and then we can be loud."
"115740052-0-48684";"Please, leave me to my sorrow!"
"115740052-0-48685";"Come on, get up. I am not ready to die a second time."
"115740052-0-48686";"Bet I'm not the only one who wishes this place would sink into the sea."
"115740052-0-48691";"Oof. Rock. Fall. Cliff? Down. Oh! Friend, mind the edge!"
"115740052-0-48692";"She was wearing that amulet!"
"115740052-0-48693";"Together we can reset the wards. Concentrate!"
"115740052-0-48694";"Yes, hello again. See you in there!"
"115740052-0-48695";"I see the Eye of Mora above us. That's where we need to go, mortal."
"115740052-0-48696";"What happened to this memory? It looks more like a dream … or a nightmare."
"115740052-0-48697";"This has to be Vaermina's fault. Stupid Prince of Dreams!"
"115740052-0-48698";"There! That's the Daggerfall Devil's mind!"
"115740052-0-48699";"This is more than just the presence of a rival Daedric Prince. Something else is happening here."
"115740052-0-48700";"Remember, Vaermina's not alone. Blightcrown and Torvesard are with her."
"115740052-0-48701";"Hidden Kindred. Looks like Vaermina brought an army."
"115740052-0-48702";"Ignore Blightcrown. We need to reach Vaermina and destroy Shelreni's body."
"115740052-0-48703";"Through there, mortal! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-48704";"You go too far, Mora!"
"115740052-0-48705";"It doesn't matter what you foresee. You can't do this to another Prince! Or to the rest of us, for that matter!"
"115740052-0-48706";"You have seen the damage Prince Ithelia has already done to the fabric of fate. If left unchecked, reality will unravel."
"115740052-0-48707";"All of us must agree, Mora. And I definitely do not. Memories are sacrosanct, as are the domains of the Princes!"
"115740052-0-48708";"You can't punish someone for something they might possibly do."
"115740052-0-48709";"I must. The risk is too great. I am truly sorry, but there is no alternative. For the sake of reality, you must all … forget!"
"115740052-0-48710";"You have them! Yes! Our globular deliverance!"
"115740052-0-48711";"Yes. My cohort will be my path to greater glories, greater knowledge. My experiment must end."
"115740052-0-48712";"Very well. Ally, step forward. Place the anchors within the ritual flames."
"115740052-0-48713";"The knowledge of the runeform is yours, arcanist. We shall see each other again."
"115740052-0-48714";"In the center of the room - that's where we'll be able to find the information we need."
"115740052-0-48715";"Use my ghost sight! There's something nearby!"
"115740052-0-48716";"I detect one more censer to destroy. Use my ghost sight!"
"115740052-0-48717";"I need some fresh air. And we need to dispose of the key in a fitting manner."
"115740052-0-48718";"The vampire mercenaries. The tower's defenses have them well occupied."
"115740052-0-48719";"Keep moving through the portals!"
"115740052-0-48720";"Well. One would think the Star-Gazers would've taken better care of this."
"115740052-0-48721";"Traversing different layers of reality is disconcerting. Quick, into that portal!"
"115740052-0-48722";"If this one doesn't get us there, I'm going to start making things explode!"
"115740052-0-48723";"Those are Vaermina markings on the walls."
"115740052-0-48724";"Dreamcarvers. Prince Vaermina's pet Dremora clan."
"115740052-0-48725";"Careful. I sense immense power ahead of us."
"115740052-0-48726";"We got what we came here for, Torvesard. This way!"
"115740052-0-48727";"Thank the ancestors, you're back! And with the phylactery I see. We need your help with the ritual."
"115740052-0-48728";"Place the phylactery in the circle!"
"115740052-0-48729";"Oh no. Tralise, your eyes!"
"115740052-0-48730";"I can't begin to thank you enough, all of you. I am sorry for my foolishness."
"115740052-0-48731";"Use this portal and return to Leramil's study. We will talk again soon."
"115740052-0-48732";"Fate's mortal. Again. Destroy them, my pet!"
"115740052-0-48733";"Examine the glyphic and see how this all began, chosen."
"115740052-0-48735";"This place, I think we visited the memory of it in the Eye of Mora!"
"115740052-0-48738";"He's down! Cohort, I'll summon the Runeform of Unmaking. Use the Fateweaver Key to banish him!"
"115740052-0-48739";"You don't deserve existence."
"115740052-0-48740";"Far better than you have said as much to me!"
"115740052-0-48741";"Your technique is derivative! At best!"
"115740052-0-48742";"My arcanum is supreme, counterpart!"
"115740052-0-48743";"Curse you, arcanist! Nooooooooo!"
"115740052-0-48744";"Careful, sister! The powers we're tampering with are not without cost!"
"115740052-0-48745";"I'll gladly pay the price if it means freeing Father."
"115740052-0-48746";"No idea what that concoction is. Curious."
"115740052-0-48747";"Perhaps … you. Ah. Might find something on her remains?"
"115740052-0-48748";"He seems suspicious. Why don't you speak to him, adventurer? See where he stands?"
"115740052-0-48749";"I can't absolve you of your transgressions, spirit, but I can grant you peace."
"115740052-0-48750";"Gadayn, this will be dangerous. I would feel better if you remain here, out of harm's way."
"115740052-0-48751";"I swore to retrieve the relic. And I can't stand the thought of you facing this danger without me—um, all of you, really."
"115740052-0-48752";"Vomitous."
"115740052-0-48754";"Between Vaermina's presence and the corruption, my fellow Daedra have turned violent! Well, more violent than usual."
"115740052-0-48755";"<mystical incantation gibberish>"
"115740052-0-48757";"Mortal, you're needed again."
"115740052-0-48758";"I sense a flaw. Use my ghost sight to reveal it."
"115740052-0-48759";"Well, now you're just trying to show off. Come on now, let's carry on!"
"115740052-0-48760";"Is not the Mythos magnificent, proxy. What I would give to better explore this place!"
"115740052-0-48761";"Leramil can't keep pushing herself like that. The corruption is wearing her down."
"115740052-0-48762";"Stay safe, proxy. And you, too, Gadayn."
"115740052-0-48763";"Leramil, when this is over—"
"115740052-0-48764";"Now is not the time, Gadayn. Go!"
"115740052-0-48765";"Aren't we done? No? All right, I'm right behind you!"
"115740052-0-48766";"Behold, the very heart of the Mythos! Just looking at it makes my head spin."
"115740052-0-48767";"No! Must … win …."
"115740052-0-48768";"Scruut's penchant for noticing anomalies of fate is impressive, but this might not be Torvesard and the glyphic. It could be anything."
"115740052-0-48770";"Transliminal Parasitism!"
"115740052-0-48771";"Libram Explodere!"
"115740052-0-48772";"Fate shifts in our direction. Good."
"115740052-0-48773";"Another layer aligns. The way is opening."
"115740052-0-48774";"Up that path to the left. I think that's where the anomaly is."
"115740052-0-48775";"You. I know you. The Dream-breaker from Stormhaven. You will not slink away this time. Die, mortal!"
"115740052-0-48779";"My daughters. You freed me."
"115740052-0-48780";"My death will change nothing! The merge is almost complete!"
"115740052-0-48787";"Here's the other one. You'll bleed before I let you find our spy."
"115740052-0-48788";"<amused snickering>"
"115740052-0-48789";"<amused snickering>"
"115740052-0-48790";"<dark laugh>"
"115740052-0-48791";"And there it is. The shiver along the spine. The sweet antidote to courage. The idea of breaking you interests me. I welcome the challenge. Remember, I'll be watching. Always."
"115740052-0-48792";"Just a few moments, boy. Then we need to get moving."
"115740052-0-48793";"That was an excellent example of a daring display gone wrong. I will cherish your skull on my mantle. Now to burn Tamriel above!"
"115740052-0-48794";"<<1>>, get them! Help me!"
"115740052-0-48795";"When will they send me some worthy opponents?"
"115740052-0-48796";"I am the Blessed Crucible! You are nothing!"
"115740052-0-48797";"Let my legend live on."
"115740052-0-48798";"Oh! The Great Eye offers you Verses. They're advantages that will last as long as your next fight."
"115740052-0-48799";"Still alive, are we? Come, I will make spigots of your throats."
"115740052-0-48801";"You killed her! Well, this version. She's spreading across the books in this archive. There could be hundreds of Tho'at Replicanum."
"115740052-0-48802";"When you're finished here, meet me back where we met. We should talk about what happened."
"115740052-0-48803";"There are more maligraphies and other Tho'at Replicanum in the archive."
"115740052-0-48804";"This maligraphy … I recognize it. In this case, that may not be a good thing. Be careful."
"115740052-0-48806";"Hermaeus Mora must be impressed. He's offering you Visions. Those last longer than Verses. Hang on, what's this?"
"115740052-0-48807";"A fragment of a nymic? It couldn't drop the whole thing? Well, if this maligraphy had a piece, the others might, too. Keep going."
"115740052-0-48809";"That Stone has held me for too long. I will never go back!"
"115740052-0-48810";"You have come far—only to die on my sword."
"115740052-0-48811";"Are you so eager to die?"
"115740052-0-48812";"Verses will make a huge difference as you fight waves of maligraphies. Select a Verse while I create a portal."
"115740052-0-48814";"Another nymic fragment! This two-pronged approach is working. You're collecting the fragments and I'm learning more about Tho'at."
"115740052-0-48815";"One of the books called Tho'at ""she who became vivified ink."" As you continue to fight, I'll try to figure out what that means."
"115740052-0-48817";"Tho'at's written her name in multiple books. I think it's so she can create maligraphies of herself. How delightful."
"115740052-0-48818";"Uncomfortable revelations aside, I won't complain about another nymic fragment. We're getting closer to our goal. Keep going."
"115740052-0-48820";"This is it! This is the fragment we needed. This completes the nymic."
"115740052-0-48821";"All we need now is a place to summon her. Keep Tho'at and the maligraphies busy while I look for the perfect location."
"115740052-0-48823";"You fools are beneath me. My shadows will contend with you. What did Lyranth promise you? Why aid that wretch? There are no spoils here but death. Her clan deserved their fate; their souls will serve me unendingly."
"115740052-0-48824";"Impressive, for insects! All you've done is delay the inevitable!"
"115740052-0-48825";"Rise, shadows, and bare your fangs!"
"115740052-0-48826";"You choose death. So be it!"
"115740052-0-48827";"Nura-jhahul! Mine is the crown of ash and shadow. Kneel …."
"115740052-0-48828";"Or die!"
"115740052-0-48829";"You … are worthy. At last … I am free."
"115740052-0-48830";"Oh, here's one. Mortal, do you have a moment?"
"115740052-0-48831";"The test intensifies. Go beyond your limits."
"115740052-0-48832";"This does not end until I am satisfied!"
"115740052-0-48833";"An end approaches, but whose?"
"115740052-0-48840";"My lord … will … hear of this."
"115740052-0-48841";"Got you!"
"115740052-0-48842";"Vorm seems excited about that one!"
"115740052-0-48843";"Another page? Let's keep looking!"
"115740052-0-48844";"I think that's it! Let's get this book back together!"
"115740052-0-48845";"Come, mortal. This might be amusing!"
"115740052-0-48846";"Now your world is mine to lay waste!"
"115740052-0-48847";"Come, servants of Dagon!"
"115740052-0-48848";"Finally, a moment's peace!"
"115740052-0-48849";"No! Where are you taking me? Divines, please—no …!"
"115740052-0-48850";"Yes, I can feel the flow of magicka! Keep going!"
"115740052-0-48851";"Where's the Legion's gold? Tell me!"
"115740052-0-48855";"Care to earn some gold, adventurer? I could use a bit of assistance."
"115740052-0-48856";"I'll join you. At a distance, of course. Wouldn't want Lazen thinking you mean him any harm."
"115740052-0-48857";"<Bark Bark>"
"115740052-0-48858";"Lazen, is that you?"
"115740052-0-48859";"Oh, I'm so happy you're safe!"
"115740052-0-48860";"<Bark>"
"115740052-0-48861";"Who's a brave boy? Who fights off bandits and monsters?"
"115740052-0-48863";"Go on Lazen, find the rest of the missing Blue Aedral!"
"115740052-0-48864";"There's another crate! Such a good boy, Lazen!"
"115740052-0-48865";"Good dog! Look for another bottle, Lazen!"
"115740052-0-48866";"Sounds like he found more wine."
"115740052-0-48867";"Good dog, Lazen!"
"115740052-0-48868";"Fate summons you, champion. Will you answer its call?"
"115740052-0-48869";"There's the Blue Aedral! And a note, let's grab that."
"115740052-0-48870";"<Whines Worriedly>"
"115740052-0-48872";"Who's a good boy, Lazen? You are!"
"115740052-0-48873";"We saved West Weald and preserved history. But Prince Ithelia still roams free."
"115740052-0-48874";"Now that you have the relics, I suppose I must open a portal to the instability. This way, mortals."
"115740052-0-48875";"I can't lose. Not to you."
"115740052-0-48876";"It's nearly dead!"
"115740052-0-48877";"I defeated the Oathsworn!"
"115740052-0-48878";"You succeeded. You are worthy of the Trial of Blood."
"115740052-0-48879";"You are worthy of the Trial of Conquest."
"115740052-0-48880";"You are worthy. The Trial of War is yours."
"115740052-0-48881";"This way, friend! Scruut told me to meet you here, but I wasn't expecting all the spirits!"
"115740052-0-48882";"Those bolts of cloth! That must be the Mephala silk that Scruut wanted us to find."
"115740052-0-48883";"Did it work? I think it worked! The relic is restored!"
"115740052-0-48884";"You made it. I was worried one of those reality tears got you."
"115740052-0-48885";"That's the forge. Ever notice that no matter how ancient, Daedric stuff never really changes? Anyway, dip Abolisher into the hot coals."
"115740052-0-48886";"Cracked acorns! Look at Abolisher! It surges with power again!"
"115740052-0-48887";"Over here, comrade! Perhaps you can make sense of what the Watchling told me."
"115740052-0-48888";"The shrine of Azura! Hold the Lamp close and let's see if this works."
"115740052-0-48889";"The Lamp of Clarity looks restored to me!"
"115740052-0-48890";"Ah, the fatewalker arrives, just as Hermorah foretold."
"115740052-0-48891";"The moon spirits favor you, fatewalker. Old Ri'jhaad sees your path clearly now."
"115740052-0-48893";"The First Mane has shown us a new path. This temple is to be razed! So commands Rid-Thar-ri'Datta!"
"115740052-0-48894";"No. This shrine is under Boethra's protection. Let this serve as a warning!"
"115740052-0-48897";"Not a legionary in sight. Where are they?"
"115740052-0-48898";"Why would Torvesard seek out a shrine to Boethiah—wait. Up above! Torvesard is here!"
"115740052-0-48899";"Ah, Mora's champions. I expected to run into you eventually."
"115740052-0-48900";"Boethiah's blade, Abolisher, is mine now. The first of the three relics I require is in my hands."
"115740052-0-48901";"Soon Prince Ithelia will be restored. I hope you are there to witness her glory!"
"115740052-0-48902";"A relic of Boethiah? One moment, proxy. We should speak."
"115740052-0-48903";"Thanks for your help. I'm going to read somewhere else."
"115740052-0-48904";"I erect the spine of gratitude. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a frog to find."
"115740052-0-48905";"Fantastic. Here's some treasures for you. I'll scrounge up my own."
"115740052-0-48906";"Thank you. Now I can hone my magic."
"115740052-0-48908";"Ah, I can sense the power of flowing through the relics. Well done! Now, Scruut and I have an idea about how to proceed."
"115740052-0-48909";"This portal will take us to Fargrave."
"115740052-0-48910";"The Loom of the Untraveled Road lies ahead of us. Stay alert for any of Mirrormoor's Daedra."
"115740052-0-48911";"The Loom of the Untraveled Road. Damaged beyond repair but still impressive. Use the Echonir and see what memories remain."
"115740052-0-48912";"Scruut awaits us at Beragon's townhouse. Let us return there at once."
"115740052-0-48913";"Everyone's back. Great. But I don't see anyone carrying anything that gets us closer to saving reality."
"115740052-0-48914";"I know those ruins. They're west of Skingrad."
"115740052-0-48915";"Then let's not waste time. Let's go get this shard!"
"115740052-0-48916";"The Golden Eye's warning was clear. This Saliache vault is no longer safe. We must move the lamp."
"115740052-0-48917";"The ruins of Ceyond lie within this cave. Let's proceed with caution."
"115740052-0-48918";"Scruut says the titan is somewhere in these ruins. I'll accompany our comrade. Beragon, Curate Gadayn, guard the entrance."
"115740052-0-48919";"That must be the titan! Let's destroy it and gather a fragment."
"115740052-0-48920";"But where can we hide the relic?"
"115740052-0-48921";"I know a cave to the north. The lamp should be safe there, once we apply the appropriate spells."
"115740052-0-48922";"An excellent battle! Gather a fragment of the titan and we can return to the others."
"115740052-0-48924";"Thank you for bringing the Echonir. We will need this relic."
"115740052-0-48925";"Speaking of relics, thieves stole an old staff from the Oathsworn Pit. I want to know why."
"115740052-0-48926";"Indeed. How did my unwelcome guests find their way to Bedlam Veil? I am … curious."
"115740052-0-48927";"Good Orcs died, little prince. I'm not curious. I'm angry."
"115740052-0-48930";"Maybe? Nothing like this has ever been attempted."
"115740052-0-48932";"That's the final relic? Good. Let's meet Leramil and Scruut back at Beragon's townhouse."
"115740052-0-48933";"That's all of them, right? You should get back to Beragon's place. And say hello to Leramil for me."
"115740052-0-48934";"That was the last of the relics? Good. Let's rendezvous with Leramil and Scruut back at my townhouse."
"115740052-0-48935";"Look! Is that a door behind the waterfall?"
"115740052-0-48936";"Betu! Where has that dog gone?"
"115740052-0-48937";"Hmm. It appears the grapes did not agree with this death hound."
"115740052-0-48938";"An injured field hand. Let's find out what happened."
"115740052-0-48939";"Let's look more closely at those grapes."
"115740052-0-48940";"Curious. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-48942";"I'm going to find a ship out of Anvil. Perhaps we'll meet again in the west, traveler."
"115740052-0-48947";"Halt. Your invitation, please."
"115740052-0-48948";"Quickly, grab the will!"
"115740052-0-48949";"Right. Here you are."
"115740052-0-48950";"Welcome Master Bogvir. And guest. I'll escort you to Lord Valente. This way."
"115740052-0-48951";"We have planned and prepared long enough. Now we must act."
"115740052-0-48953";"I shall open a portal to Apocrypha. Once there, use the Skein and let us see if we can pick up Ithelia's trail."
"115740052-0-48954";"Back off. This here's Maleron's private tent."
"115740052-0-48955";"I can't believe I bought one of those imperial spies a drink!"
"115740052-0-48956";"Torvesard warned us you'd be coming. Though the relic he sought wasn't here, he left me to deal with you."
"115740052-0-48957";"Guess I wasn't as sneaky as I thought. Must be out of practice. What's that on the floor?"
"115740052-0-48958";"Damn you, Mad God!"
"115740052-0-48959";"Daedric energy lingers in this place, tangled with threads of unraveling fate."
"115740052-0-48960";"Torvesard was here. Follow the threads of fate, proxy. I shall cast about for any other signs of his activity."
"115740052-0-48961";"Who's this then? Idolus? What is it you want?"
"115740052-0-48962";"Totally unnecessary. I'll find him. Thanks!"
"115740052-0-48963";"Just a moment. Let's talk first."
"115740052-0-48966";"Use the Skein and let us see if it can pick up Ithelia's trail."
"115740052-0-48967";"Another way to reach the Mythos, perhaps? Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum?"
"115740052-0-48969";"The Skein leads us to that cave, proxy."
"115740052-0-48970";"The One Who Knows needs us, proxy!"
"115740052-0-48975";"Fascinating. That ancient book stirred up a memory. Use the Echonir to examine it, proxy."
"115740052-0-48978";"The Tribunal's Ordinators hold our brethren. We need the Skein of Secrets to free them."
"115740052-0-48979";"But the Skein is lost! We must beseech the Lady of Whispers for help."
"115740052-0-48980";"Then let us adjourn to her secret sanctuary. The circle we stand upon is the door. We need but a single drop of blood to open it."
"115740052-0-48982";"Ah, I see. This ritual circle conceals a gate, activated by a little blood. Let us see where it leads."
"115740052-0-48983";"Nothing. Fate seems to be fighting back. I wonder how much of that is because of you."
"115740052-0-48987";"Torvesard, talk to fate's chosen. Tell us what this is all about."
"115740052-0-48988";"An Ayleid ruin? Interesting. Do you perceive the threads of fate?"
"115740052-0-48989";"The threads mark Torvesard's trail. Follow them. I will search the surroundings for any other hidden signs."
"115740052-0-48992";"Begone wretch! The power of the well is mine!"
"115740052-0-48993";"And you believe Mora? Stand aside, mortal. I will not be swayed from my purpose."
"115740052-0-48994";"It's sealed. I suppose we could … knock?"
"115740052-0-48995";"We have no time for this. I shall open a portal."
"115740052-0-48996";"No need for that. The Golden Eye foretold your coming. Welcome."
"115740052-0-48997";"The abbot! Forgive our intrusion and listen to what our friend has to say."
"115740052-0-49001";"I pray you aren't another rogue come to take what's left."
"115740052-0-49002";"Please, find what you can of my dowry and I'll compensate you handsomely."
"115740052-0-49003";"What's this? Did my betrothed hire someone to retrieve his dowry? How quaint."
"115740052-0-49004";"You should be warned. My beasts don't like losing their toys and they do love his shiny gifts."
"115740052-0-49005";"Doesn't Grander realize the opportunity I've given him? Why try to recover his bid for my hand?"
"115740052-0-49006";"What joy can be found in a marriage fueled by coin?"
"115740052-0-49007";"Help him if you feel so inclined, but be warned. The beasts of Fyrelight are ravenous."
"115740052-0-49008";"You've returned in one piece! I hope you gave that brigand what-for."
"115740052-0-49009";"Good news! The adventurer retrieved my dowry. We can continue on to Skingrad as planned. And I promise you both a pint of ale when we get there!"
"115740052-0-49010";"Tread carefully, adventurer. I've had my fill of impish fools with childish dreams."
"115740052-0-49012";"We'll never surrender this fort!"
"115740052-0-49013";"You're facing the best of Dark Company now, fools!"
"115740052-0-49014";"At least they don't gloat before a kill."
"115740052-0-49016";"What use have I for collars of gold and silver?"
"115740052-0-49017";"Contracts be damned. I know my worth and Grander should come to learn his."
"115740052-0-49018";"I'm certain Grander will wonder whether he was inadequate. Unworthy, of my love."
"115740052-0-49019";"The tharriker grow restless. We have that in common. It's time we left these woods behind."
"115740052-0-49020";"I had dreams of being a great warden, you know."
"115740052-0-49021";"But these woods have changed. The land doesn't sing to me anymore."
"115740052-0-49022";"Return the dowry to Grander if you wish. I'm leaving all this nonsense behind."
"115740052-0-49025";"It's the Recollection. They invaded and took the lodges. I only got out because Black-Glove Garm distracted them."
"115740052-0-49027";"Not now, Betu! Away with you!"
"115740052-0-49028";"With the will secured, let us speak with Edric."
"115740052-0-49029";"Just like at the Loom, Mora could not portal us closer to the energy now contained in Ithelia. But look what her very presence does to Apocrypha! We must hurry."
"115740052-0-49030";"A dead end, but the path should continue. Use the Lamp of Clarity and see what it reveals."
"115740052-0-49031";"What havoc these changes must be wreaking in Apocrypha's core!"
"115740052-0-49032";"That door bears the marks of Mirrormoor."
"115740052-0-49033";"How strange. Come, let us speak, traveler."
"115740052-0-49035";"If you insist on staying, that's your business. Just watch your back."
"115740052-0-49036";"Use the Echonir. Maybe it will offer a clue."
"115740052-0-49037";"Mora hides in his sanctum? I will transform this realm and make it his tomb! Set wards in place, my scion. Fate's minions must not be allowed to interfere."
"115740052-0-49038";"How generous. A whole drink after nearly losing an arm to a tharriker."
"115740052-0-49039";"Yes, my Prince. None shall find the wards."
"115740052-0-49040";"We must locate those hidden wards, proxy. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can serve us here."
"115740052-0-49042";"I'm running out of patience. Tell everyone to join us or die."
"115740052-0-49043";"Hey! Wait for me."
"115740052-0-49044";"Easier than I thought getting here. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-49045";"Stand near the shard and activate the Alarum."
"115740052-0-49046";"Right, there's the pattern. Pay attention."
"115740052-0-49047";"Great! It's untethered. Now just grab the shard."
"115740052-0-49048";"No, that's not it. Try again, or talk to me if you need a reminder on what to do."
"115740052-0-49049";"I think you've got this. Try not to run afoul of those necromancers. I'll meet you outside when you're finished."
"115740052-0-49050";"He'd be right. I've tamed beasts and monsters. I've no need for a mouse."
"115740052-0-49051";"I've taken what I need. Enough gold to start a new life, far away from here. You should do the same."
"115740052-0-49052";"I'm not here to fight. My family drama put you in danger. I owe you some answers if you want them."
"115740052-0-49053";"Farewell, adventurer. Perhaps one day we'll cross paths again."
"115740052-0-49054";"Oh gods. Haldain's really gone."
"115740052-0-49055";"Well, let's get this over with. Read it aloud, Mizzik."
"115740052-0-49056";"Yes, of course. Weatherleah's walls hide a glittering secret. Safely guarded by four loyal paws."
"115740052-0-49057";"Do not worry, Mizzik and his assistant will get to the bottom of this."
"115740052-0-49058";"Strange. Betu doesn't seem too fond of you, cousin."
"115740052-0-49059";"There he is! My faithful friend … oh!"
"115740052-0-49060";"I hope Betu's return means you retrieved the will, Mizzik?"
"115740052-0-49062";"Nonsense. I'm sure Betu just needs time to remember me. Isn't that right, boy?"
"115740052-0-49063";"The Skein indicates that the wards are somewhere above. Look for a passage leading up."
"115740052-0-49066";"Why would Lady Weatherleah leave a riddle in her will?"
"115740052-0-49067";"Could the four paws mean Betu? They certainly are not Mizzik's. Perhaps we can find a clue here in her study?"
"115740052-0-49068";"Were you waiting for them to trip on your insides?"
"115740052-0-49069";"That sounds like you're not coming with us. Good, you need to recover. We'll get Khurga."
"115740052-0-49070";"I had them right where I wanted them."
"115740052-0-49072";"Leramil! You've returned, but I know that look. What's wrong?"
"115740052-0-49073";"Torvesard once more moves against Apocrypha. He seeks to restore the Forgotten Prince. I'll let our friend explain."
"115740052-0-49074";"As grateful as I am, Bazrag. Axeborn Khurga could use your help in the Lodge of the Axe."
"115740052-0-49075";"Secrecy is everything. Yet we must leave something behind in the event that we fail."
"115740052-0-49076";"Even if we succeed, the need to act again may arise some long tomorrow from now."
"115740052-0-49077";"Herma-Mora will not allow that to happen. But I agree. We should leave instructions here for those who come after."
"115740052-0-49078";"The Prince of Paths caused the sea to swallow this ancient city. Hermorah's temple now lies beneath the waves."
"115740052-0-49079";"Then that is where we must go. Mephala, Lady of Whispers, take this mortal shell!"
"115740052-0-49080";"I am ready. Boethiah, I call upon you! Dark Warrior, let me bear you to the conclave of Princes!"
"115740052-0-49081";"Boethiah's blade led me to this portal. The path to the Mythos, Apocrypha's heart."
"115740052-0-49082";"Only those bearing the essence of Azura, Boethiah, or Mephala can access this portal."
"115740052-0-49083";"The gate recognizes Boethiah's blade. Now I can return to the Mythos and find my Prince at last!"
"115740052-0-49084";"The last glyphic and the final secret. I must know what happened to Prince Ithelia!"
"115740052-0-49085";"We defeated Prince Ithelia. Now we must all forget our victory."
"115740052-0-49086";"Forget? Why should I forget how I took this mortal shell and tracked Ithelia with my Skein?"
"115740052-0-49087";"Azura and I did our part with these vessels of flesh. And the Lamp and Abolisher."
"115740052-0-49088";"Listen, my fellow Princes. The Lord of Fate is right. Imprison Ithelia in your Mythos, Mora. Then erase all memory of her existence."
"115740052-0-49090";"Imprisoned by cowards? Abandoned by betrayers? But I remember! And I know how to free my Prince!"
"115740052-0-49091";"There! Ithelia and Torvesard! But what have they done to Hermaeus Mora?"
"115740052-0-49092";"Only a threat to you, Mora!"
"115740052-0-49094";"Your reality, fate-seer, not mine. Witness the ascension of the Prince of Paths to her rightful place of power!"
"115740052-0-49096";"A note peeking out from behind the painting? Excellent eye for detail, friend."
"115740052-0-49098";"Interesting. A hidden note guarded by a painted dog. What does it say?"
"115740052-0-49099";"Over here, proxy! Use the Mirror of Truth!"
"115740052-0-49101";"Hermaeus Mora, you were right. I am a danger to fate and reality. Let me return what is rightfully yours."
"115740052-0-49102";"You are surrendering? Abandoning our sacred quest?"
"115740052-0-49104";"Poor Torvesard. Blinded by a compulsion I never should have bestowed."
"115740052-0-49105";"Fate's chosen has accomplished the tasks I set before them. Now let us enter the portal and conclude this heinous business. Your prison awaits, Ithelia."
"115740052-0-49106";"If Aquilia was Lady Weatherleah's last living heir, could she have expected to receive the missing fortune? A motive, perhaps?"
"115740052-0-49107";"My love, the investigator returns. We'll continue our discussion later."
"115740052-0-49108";"It seems Otho Florius found <<1>>'s body. We should be sure to speak with him and the Chef Edric as well."
"115740052-0-49109";"There you go, <<1>>! Baths aren't so bad."
"115740052-0-49110";"You should take a look at the library. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-49111";"Certainly a ladder couldn't have caused this much damage to the statue."
"115740052-0-49112";"You are certain this is where you found her body?"
"115740052-0-49113";"Yes, I'll never forget the sight of her lying there."
"115740052-0-49114";"Quite the mess for a simple fall, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-49115";"Was that window already broken?"
"115740052-0-49116";"No, it was definitely intact before Lady Weatherleah's death."
"115740052-0-49117";"Something has broken the glass. Perhaps this was an escape route?"
"115740052-0-49118";"Mizzik has seen enough."
"115740052-0-49120";"I would never hurt <<1>>!"
"115740052-0-49121";"Until the investigation is complete, everyone is a suspect."
"115740052-0-49122";"Ah, there you are! I have been expecting you."
"115740052-0-49124";"Betu found a key? And look, it seems Betu wants us to follow him."
"115740052-0-49126";"One second, I'm just finishing—Oh. Hello there, what can I do for you?"
"115740052-0-49127";"The time has come! Let's gather for the auction."
"115740052-0-49128";"You cut me for the last time. Crush her!"
"115740052-0-49129";"There you are. Quickly, let's speak."
"115740052-0-49131";"Agh!"
"115740052-0-49132";"Moons above! Is that Edric?"
"115740052-0-49133";"I won't let you down, captain. This way, friend!"
"115740052-0-49139";"Khurga!"
"115740052-0-49140";"There you are! Let's talk."
"115740052-0-49141";"You'll pay for that."
"115740052-0-49142";"Tea? This one smells ginger, hibiscus, and something else. Something sickly."
"115740052-0-49143";"A confession? And a flowery one at that. Mizzik isn't sure what to make of this."
"115740052-0-49145";"Thank you, Uriel. That's all. We should speak to Pelena next, traveler."
"115740052-0-49146";"Thank you, Pelena. We will investigate all lingering threads. Traveler, let's speak with the gardener next."
"115740052-0-49147";"Mizzik recalls a gilded key revealed to us by Betu."
"115740052-0-49148";"If you already found the missing key, you may be able to unlock Lady Weatherleah's bed chambers."
"115740052-0-49149";"Welcome, proxy. Let us speak before we go inside."
"115740052-0-49150";"The residue on that teacup stinks with the same foul smell as the tainted tea we found with Edric's body."
"115740052-0-49151";"If this letter is true, then Pelena played a role in Uriel's death! And this signature, is this the name of our resident imposter?"
"115740052-0-49152";"Mizzik would like to hear your thoughts on what we found."
"115740052-0-49153";"Mizzik heard a scream from down the hall! We must hurry!"
"115740052-0-49154";"Not only a maze, but a tomb. Careful—the Ayleids were practitioners of necromancy."
"115740052-0-49155";"A locked gate? We must find the key, proxy."
"115740052-0-49156";"He's dead! Someone killed him!"
"115740052-0-49157";"Betu? Betu, what's wrong boy?"
"115740052-0-49158";"Nobody leaves until Mizzik finds out what happened! Traveler, there's something by the body, quick."
"115740052-0-49162";"That key must unlock these gates. Let us continue, proxy. I sense that what we seek lies somewhere to the south."
"115740052-0-49164";"We found the shrine. But who is—oh. That is Ithelia! Perhaps you can talk to her, proxy."
"115740052-0-49165";"Khurga!"
"115740052-0-49166";"Dulzush. Help Dulzush."
"115740052-0-49167";"I can't leave you like this—"
"115740052-0-49168";"Don't get sentimental. If we lose Dulzush, we lose the forge. Please."
"115740052-0-49169";"All right. You fought well, Axeborn."
"115740052-0-49170";"The Lodge of the Forge is just through the vault there. Go, before Dulzush Forgefire meets the same end."
"115740052-0-49172";"Valente's journal said he had a coven of vampires. We should expect a fight."
"115740052-0-49174";"Captives! And apparently under the influence of the wine."
"115740052-0-49175";"Friend, let's speak."
"115740052-0-49176";"Damned dog! How are you still alive?"
"115740052-0-49177";"The Count of Skingrad will decide your fate."
"115740052-0-49178";"Betu, where did you find this? Betu?"
"115740052-0-49179";"Oh, good! I was starting to worry."
"115740052-0-49180";"And that should do it. You're free to administer the cure."
"115740052-0-49181";"Mizzik can't believe it. Is this Lady Weatherleah's missing fortune? Let us investigate."
"115740052-0-49182";"Looks like the effects are already subsiding."
"115740052-0-49183";"You saved us! Please, you need to stop him."
"115740052-0-49184";"We need to destroy that laboratory. You scout ahead while I work on freeing these people. I'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-49185";"That's it. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-49186";"We made it! We actually made it!"
"115740052-0-49187";"You take the payroll and report back to the captain. I'll continue to ring the bell until help arrives."
"115740052-0-49192";"You risk everything, Ithelia. You must forsake the Many Paths."
"115740052-0-49193";"Ithelia, it is time to resume your imprisonment."
"115740052-0-49194";"You seek to diminish my Prince. Why should she agree to such a demand?"
"115740052-0-49195";"To preserve reality. Her willfulness threatens all of existence."
"115740052-0-49196";"You let your fear control you and foresee an apocalypse that will never be. Depart, Mora!"
"115740052-0-49197";"I accept that fate, Hermaeus Mora."
"115740052-0-49198";"What say you, Prince of Paths? Will you accept eternal banishment in a realm where your power does not exist?"
"115740052-0-49199";"And allow me to show you how to open that path, while I still have the will to do so."
"115740052-0-49200";"Then allow me to turn my gaze upon the Many Paths, to find a worthy reality."
"115740052-0-49201";"Ithelia disappeared as soon as the memory ended. Let us speak outside."
"115740052-0-49202";"Ithelia is gone, no longer a threat. But proxy, we should speak."
"115740052-0-49203";"Remove your grubby hands from the sacred items!"
"115740052-0-49204";"Thieves as well as cheats!"
"115740052-0-49205";"Poison? Out. Out!"
"115740052-0-49206";"I need to make sure the Staff of Many Paths is really missing. Go help Dulzush Forgefire."
"115740052-0-49207";"I was so nervous when the captain handed me the payroll, I hid it in a barrel in the camp at the north end of the river."
"115740052-0-49208";"The barrel where I stashed the payroll should be around here."
"115740052-0-49209";"On my way out, I tossed the bell tower key in a stack of hay in the southern stables."
"115740052-0-49210";"I was in this hall when the fort was attacked. I hid the communique in an ash pile in the fireplace before I joined the retreat."
"115740052-0-49211";"You think this place intimidates me? I am the forge's fire."
"115740052-0-49212";"We don't need to intimidate you to kill you."
"115740052-0-49213";"Those brittle Recollection warriors thought they could burn the Oathsworn."
"115740052-0-49215";"Ogre dung! All right, we'll deal with that problem later. For now, I'm just grateful that those Wood Elves are gone."
"115740052-0-49216";"They tried to kill the Oathsworn, but this adventurer doled out the pit's revenge."
"115740052-0-49217";"They're winning, Tutor!"
"115740052-0-49218";"The Darkshard's power is beginning to wane!"
"115740052-0-49219";"This… this can't be."
"115740052-0-49225";"Let us review what we saw in the ruins, proxy."
"115740052-0-49226";"Mortal! The Great Eye requires one last task before your contract expires—along with everything else!"
"115740052-0-49227";"Welcome to my townhouse, friends! I can't wait to hear the results of your investigations."
"115740052-0-49235";"What exactly are you implying, Colovian?"
"115740052-0-49236";"I'm not implying, I'm saying it outright! This land wasn't yours to grow a forest over!"
"115740052-0-49237";"That's enough, tribune!"
"115740052-0-49238";"Apologies, greenspeaker. What can you tell us about the seed my friend is carrying?"
"115740052-0-49239";"Fine! You and the mercenary handle it."
"115740052-0-49240";"Over here, friend! We should talk."
"115740052-0-49243";"The hero of the moment! Come speak with me when you can, friend."
"115740052-0-49244";"Hey! I want to talk to the heroic mortal, too!"
"115740052-0-49246";"When we find Nantharion, we'd better be ready for a fight. I'll muster the Legion—and warn Vashabar, too."
"115740052-0-49247";"Chosen of fate, approach. We will have words."
"115740052-0-49248";"We might be able to avoid a pitched battle if we find a clever way to sabotage his plans."
"115740052-0-49249";"I doubt it will be that easy. And I intend to make sure Nantharion doesn't escape again."
"115740052-0-49250";"Friend, I'd like to say a few words about what we accomplished."
"115740052-0-49251";"The void prevails."
"115740052-0-49253";"Well now! Perhaps my luck is changing for the better."
"115740052-0-49254";"That's one seed. It looks like there's another one deeper in."
"115740052-0-49256";"Halt! King Nantharion sees no one without good cause."
"115740052-0-49257";"The wildburn is but a tool, my Prince. A way to awaken the Ayleid magic sleeping beneath this land."
"115740052-0-49258";"Fine. I'll wait here."
"115740052-0-49259";"Yes, the Well of Miscarcand. I remember it now."
"115740052-0-49260";"Miscarcand was the ancient realm of my ancestors, my Prince. But the well lies hidden."
"115740052-0-49261";"Thank you, tribune. Come, friend."
"115740052-0-49262";"I can open the way for you. The wellspring of power awaits in a starry vault deep beneath the city. Come. I will show you."
"115740052-0-49263";"We have good cause. We've come to warn him of a danger to Vashabar."
"115740052-0-49264";"There's Beragon! I think he's found something."
"115740052-0-49265";"Very well, but the legionary must remain here."
"115740052-0-49266";"One more moment, Beragon. I need to speak with our friend first."
"115740052-0-49267";"Everyone, your attention, please!"
"115740052-0-49268";"Let's celebrate not only our victories, but the heroic actions of our friend here. They defeated the rogue Dremora, Vargas and Torvesard. Took down Nantharion, the false king. They saved West Weald, maybe the entire world!"
"115740052-0-49269";"So raise a glass and shout a cheer! Thank you, my friend, for always doing what you do best!"
"115740052-0-49270";"Miscarcand? That's where we'll find King Nantharion!"
"115740052-0-49271";"Maerenah, here?"
"115740052-0-49272";"We need to tell Balandrus!"
"115740052-0-49273";"Run, you bastards."
"115740052-0-49274";"Over here, friend! This legionary says this doorway just opened—and Tribune Alea's somewhere inside."
"115740052-0-49275";"Damn vampires! Cowards, the lot of them! Look around. We need to find Tham or a clue as to what happened to him."
"115740052-0-49276";"We'll meet you near Leftwheal, friend. If there's another seed there, we need to find it."
"115740052-0-49277";"Over here! Help! We're trapped!"
"115740052-0-49278";"Cracked acorns! I don't like the look of these statues. Watch your step in here, friend."
"115740052-0-49279";"Sutch doesn't deserve this horror."
"115740052-0-49280";"Please, I only just joined—"
"115740052-0-49281";"I thought Oathsworn were mighty warriors."
"115740052-0-49282";"This is Tham's place. I hope he's all right."
"115740052-0-49283";"Balandrus needs to pay for what he's done here."
"115740052-0-49284";"Look at these halls! It's just like the legend said. We're definitely in the right place."
"115740052-0-49285";"That's Tham's sword. I gave it to him so he could protect the tavern."
"115740052-0-49286";"Tham's favorite, torn but no blood. Could be a good sign. Maybe."
"115740052-0-49287";"I knew Tham would get word to me. Don't like the way he ended it, but I know exactly where to find the best vintage."
"115740052-0-49288";"Tribune Alea! You're safe."
"115740052-0-49291";"Safe? We were pinned between a Daedra-spewing portal and a blocked passage before you came along."
"115740052-0-49292";"These legionaries need help. Go on ahead. I'll do what I can for them."
"115740052-0-49294";"You made another portal! Let's go!"
"115740052-0-49297";"Look! Didn't we see something like that in Hoperoot? Use the Echonir."
"115740052-0-49298";"All right. Let's talk this through."
"115740052-0-49300";"If this memory interests you so much, allow me to send you there!"
"115740052-0-49301";"Father? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-49302";"Hush, Abel! You'll give us away!"
"115740052-0-49303";"The clerk kept a spare key in a box by her desk. We'll need that to open the vault."
"115740052-0-49306";"Why continue this futile struggle, Ithelia? Every fate before me says you cannot win."
"115740052-0-49307";"But you do not see everything, Mora. In the Many Paths, all things are possible. I will write my own fate!"
"115740052-0-49308";"Ithelia, wait!"
"115740052-0-49309";"I can't wait any longer. I need to stop Nantharion!"
"115740052-0-49310";"With the well, I will empower the staff—and restore the memory of my Prince! Now be still!"
"115740052-0-49311";"The Staff of Many Paths was never meant for mortal hands. Witness its true power!"
"115740052-0-49312";"Ithelia! Unweaver, Mistress of the Many Paths, let your glory be restored!"
"115740052-0-49313";"Remember your true self and free us from the chains of fate!"
"115740052-0-49314";"I am whole! Come, Vargas. It is time to go home. With the Loom I will restore all that was lost."
"115740052-0-49318";"Proxy. I hoped to find you here. I sensed a powerful ripple in fate, and came as quickly as I could."
"115740052-0-49319";"Stay back! Wait—Maerenah? You're with those bloodsuckers?"
"115740052-0-49320";"I'm not with them. Not anymore. My friend will explain while I keep watch."
"115740052-0-49321";"We'll kill Balandrus and put an end to this. You have my word. And we'll find your husband. Let's go."
"115740052-0-49322";"Definitely fresh. And they head southwest."
"115740052-0-49323";"That pack. Check it out while I keep watch."
"115740052-0-49324";"What's that on the ground ahead?"
"115740052-0-49325";"Mining gear. Discarded to lose weight, I'd guess. Looks like they started veering west here."
"115740052-0-49326";"Clothing. Must have been torn in a struggle. Careful, I think we're close."
"115740052-0-49327";"There, tracks! Take a closer look."
"115740052-0-49328";"Someone took out these bloodfiends. And look. What's that paper?"
"115740052-0-49329";"Damn Grivier and his cowardly eyes! We need to talk."
"115740052-0-49330";"You have my thanks, stranger. I can help him get to safety."
"115740052-0-49331";"Maerenah? Stranger, cut me free! She's one of those monsters!"
"115740052-0-49332";"I'm the monster? After what you did? You better speak to him. Not sure I can guarantee I won't snap his neck if I get too close."
"115740052-0-49333";"Friend, we need to talk about this."
"115740052-0-49334";"We're trapped! Please, put out the flames! Hurry!"
"115740052-0-49335";"Please! You can't leave me here!"
"115740052-0-49336";"Thank you. We can find our way from here."
"115740052-0-49337";"Shut up, Grivier. Run back to your wife before I decide to tell her we were too late."
"115740052-0-49338";"Burn!"
"115740052-0-49339";"Rosalyn mentioned explosives. Look for alchemical oil and combustion canisters."
"115740052-0-49340";"Tribune Alea, look out!"
"115740052-0-49341";"I'll live. Thanks, Beragon."
"115740052-0-49342";"Are you hurt?"
"115740052-0-49343";"The Recollection ambushed us. Like they knew we were coming."
"115740052-0-49344";"I spotted the seed just up the hill."
"115740052-0-49345";"Friend, destroy the seed. We'll hold off the Recollection!"
"115740052-0-49346";"You burned the seed? Good. One less threat to worry about."
"115740052-0-49347";"They knew we were coming. Either the greenspeaker set us up, or there's a spy in Nantharion's court."
"115740052-0-49348";"A spy! Then the king is in danger! Friend, let's talk."
"115740052-0-49349";"Hey, over here!"
"115740052-0-49350";"Over here! There's Hoperoot. Something isn't right. The sentries wouldn't let us in."
"115740052-0-49351";"Be ready. I'm going in!"
"115740052-0-49352";"Stay here, friend. Let her clear the gate!"
"115740052-0-49353";"Listen, you! I want answers from Nantharion and I want them now!"
"115740052-0-49354";"She came back? Seize her!"
"115740052-0-49355";"And that's the plan. Get to the gate!"
"115740052-0-49356";"I'm here, comrade! I lost the sentries, but there's a damned Recollection army in here!"
"115740052-0-49357";"Nantharion must be a prisoner in his own settlement. Keep your eyes open for any information about the Recollection's plans."
"115740052-0-49358";"With that oil and the combustion canisters, we're all set. Let's find those weapon stockpiles."
"115740052-0-49359";"Careful. One spark and you'll be engulfed in alchemical fire."
"115740052-0-49360";"You come to fight Xeemhok? Xeemhok fights!"
"115740052-0-49361";"No! Xeemhok must … take … trophies …."
"115740052-0-49362";"Over here! This must be a Recollection command post."
"115740052-0-49363";"No sign of the king, but the map and notes might be important. Take them, friend."
"115740052-0-49364";"Where am I? What force draws me to this place?"
"115740052-0-49365";"Is that … yes, I believe they call it a tavern. I see the Many Paths converging there."
"115740052-0-49366";"What in Oblivion did we just see?"
"115740052-0-49369";"That shawl … there's something strange about it."
"115740052-0-49370";"That looks like another wildburn seed!"
"115740052-0-49371";"Let's look around. And try to keep out of sight until we're ready to make a move."
"115740052-0-49372";"Nirn? How awful. Now, where have my creatures wandered off to?"
"115740052-0-49373";"That takes care of the weapon stockpiles. Now let's head into the mine."
"115740052-0-49374";"Here. The seed for Skingrad is ready, my king."
"115740052-0-49375";"Bring it to my throne room. Vargas and I will perform the final ritual and send the seed on its way!"
"115740052-0-49376";"The Shardborn are fickle allies."
"115740052-0-49377";"We serve the same Prince. As long as I lead the Recollection, the Shardborn will aid us."
"115740052-0-49378";"Yes, my king."
"115740052-0-49379";"Someone's coming! Get down!"
"115740052-0-49380";"I knew it! Nantharion leads the Recollection! And the Prince they serve must be Ithelia!"
"115740052-0-49381";"I heard everything. Get to the throne room. I'll circle around and hit them from the back!"
"115740052-0-49382";"Be careful. I remember encountering some deadly traps. And it looks like the Recollection's been busy down here, too."
"115740052-0-49384";"I leave the Staff of Many Paths in your care, Nantharion. Use it well—bah! Your tree has pests!"
"115740052-0-49385";"Greenspeaker Sorilen, deal with the intruders! They must not interfere with the ritual!"
"115740052-0-49386";"Vargas, help me prepare the seed!"
"115740052-0-49388";"No! The ritual is not complete!"
"115740052-0-49389";"What a loss. I found that letter clutched in his hand."
"115740052-0-49390";"Great! Let's go back to the great welkynd stone and try it in one of the sockets."
"115740052-0-49391";"Something's wrong! It's too soon! The wildburn seed released its energy too early! Run!"
"115740052-0-49392";"The wildburn seed! It released its energy when you destroyed it! Hoperoot is doomed!"
"115740052-0-49394";"Follow Nantharion! He must know a way out!"
"115740052-0-49395";"By the Green! The wildburn seed destroyed Hoperoot."
"115740052-0-49396";"Hoperoot? A pretty name for an ugly secret."
"115740052-0-49397";"And a grim tomb for Greenspeaker Sorilen. Friend, we should talk."
"115740052-0-49400";"The servants are hiding in the catacombs. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-49401";"That strange glow. Is the Lamp doing that?"
"115740052-0-49402";"Amazing! That stone wasn't there until the light of the Lamp revealed it."
"115740052-0-49403";"That book! It is the very one those three ancient priests were handling in the memory. Examine it, proxy."
"115740052-0-49405";"Look! The stone you placed is feeding the greater welkynd. Let's find the rest of the lesser stones."
"115740052-0-49407";"I overheard your conversation, proxy. Anudnabia is just to the north of here. Gadayn and I will meet you there."
"115740052-0-49408";"Look! I think that's another hidden welkynd stone. Use the Lamp, friend."
"115740052-0-49409";"I think there's another stone nearby. Try the Lamp here."
"115740052-0-49410";"I think the Lamp's found another stone. Give it a try."
"115740052-0-49411";"There it is! Another welkynd stone. Go ahead, take it."
"115740052-0-49412";"Look at that! Another stone. Take it, friend."
"115740052-0-49413";"Amazing. The Lamp pulled the stone into our reality somehow. How does this work?"
"115740052-0-49414";"Another stone. Two more, and we'll see what the great welkynd stone is protecting."
"115740052-0-49415";"That's three lesser stones. There should be one more to find."
"115740052-0-49416";"That's the last of them. Let's return to the great welkynd stone and see if we can open the vault!"
"115740052-0-49420";"This is incredible! Look at us, strolling along the seabed like it was a street in Necrom!"
"115740052-0-49421";"Stay alert and move straight ahead, both of you. And watch out for any large, predatory sea life."
"115740052-0-49425";"Shardborn? Who in Oblivion are they?"
"115740052-0-49426";"The Mythos of Apocrypha, heart of Hermaeus Mora's domain. Torvesard is somewhere ahead of us."
"115740052-0-49427";"Tribune? Thank the Divines! Are they gone?"
"115740052-0-49431";"That's the key! Now let's go open the catacombs. The door is across from the barracks."
"115740052-0-49432";"Still no sign of the escaped legionary, shardmarshal."
"115740052-0-49434";"Defend the anchors! Maintain the portal!"
"115740052-0-49435";"Damn these mortals! Retreat!"
"115740052-0-49436";"That closed the portal! Good work!"
"115740052-0-49437";"Over here, comrade. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-49438";"Torvesard! He found the last glyphic!"
"115740052-0-49439";"My apologies, mortal. They see anyone marked by Mora as a foe, and I have no time to tell them any different."
"115740052-0-49440";"I remember our realm—Mirrormoor! Ithelia's servants awaken!"
"115740052-0-49441";"Empty! After roaming Oblivion and Nirn for ages, tormented by a question I could not even frame, this is my answer? I did not forget my Prince!"
"115740052-0-49442";"Doomed! We're all doomed! Mortal, reality itself is threatened!"
"115740052-0-49443";"A tear in the fabric of reality! Not only have the threads of fate been parted … a piece of existence has been destroyed!"
"115740052-0-49444";"Um, that's not good. Examine it, mortal. But carefully! Very carefully."
"115740052-0-49445";"An unexpected reaction, but it tells us much."
"115740052-0-49446";"Mortal, I think I know what's happening here. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-49447";"We shall send Gadayn, Beragon, and Tribune Alea to assist you, proxy."
"115740052-0-49448";"Lazen is back there!"
"115740052-0-49450";"Let's talk outside! Come on Lazen!"
"115740052-0-49451";"<Excited Bark>"
"115740052-0-49452";"Is that one of those tears in reality Scruut spoke about? I'd keep my distance from it if I were you."
"115740052-0-49453";"There are many hidden paths between the planes. I suspect the Skein of Secrets has showed us one. Prepare yourselves."
"115740052-0-49456";"Rest easy, friend."
"115740052-0-49457";"I trusted you! You … you …."
"115740052-0-49458";"I can't believe Ruri betrayed us. He could've gotten Lazen or the others killed!"
"115740052-0-49459";"Ruri! You scheming bastard!"
"115740052-0-49460";"Why're you so mad? It's not like you can't make more wine."
"115740052-0-49461";"Watch yourselves. Who knows what dangers still lurk near the Loom."
"115740052-0-49462";"All right everyone. We recovered the Blue Aedral. As always, as soon as we sell it, everyone will get a share of the profits. Everyone except Ruri, that is."
"115740052-0-49463";"The taint of Mirrormoor remains strong here."
"115740052-0-49464";"The Loom … even destroyed, it radiates power."
"115740052-0-49465";"To think, Fargrave was once a part of Ithelia's realm."
"115740052-0-49468";"Pretend you never saw me, traveler."
"115740052-0-49469";"Nothing, damn them!"
"115740052-0-49470";"Is nothing salvageable, my Prince?"
"115740052-0-49471";"Very well. If I cannot restore Mirrormoor, I will create a new realm—upon the festering corpse of Apocrypha!"
"115740052-0-49472";"Curious. This is Fargrave. Did Ithelia come this way to make use of the Celestial Palanquin?"
"115740052-0-49473";"Hmm. Beragon and Tribune Alea were right behind us, but have not yet appeared. We should confer, proxy."
"115740052-0-49474";"Apocrypha! Proxy, we must talk!"
"115740052-0-49477";"The crystal grows more prominent, as if Mirrormoor follows in its Prince's wake."
"115740052-0-49478";"This realm so easily bends to Ithelia's will. Could Fargrave be a cast-off portion of Mirrormoor?"
"115740052-0-49480";"That door, proxy. I believe that is our way forward."
"115740052-0-49483";"A memory of Torvesard and Vargas before they recovered what had been forgotten. Let us talk."
"115740052-0-49485";"You dare trespass in Mirrormoor? In the very heart of our power?"
"115740052-0-49488";"I banish you to the Many Paths, never to return!"
"115740052-0-49489";"Proxy, stay close!"
"115740052-0-49490";"You haven't made up your mind about this army, master. Why send an invitation?"
"115740052-0-49491";"I didn't invite them. They're invading."
"115740052-0-49492";"It'd be a shame to waste this glorious opportunity. Ah, you'll do nicely."
"115740052-0-49495";"Agreed. We'll meet you there."
"115740052-0-49496";"You're safe now. Go join your family."
"115740052-0-49497";"We'll make sure the path behind you remains clear!"
"115740052-0-49498";"Is that a reality tear? It looks as dangerous as Scruut described."
"115740052-0-49499";"I hope Beragon doesn't get bored and decide to follow us. He really wanted to explore these ruins."
"115740052-0-49500";"The symbols in the mirrors match the symbols above the arch. That must indicate something."
"115740052-0-49501";"That did something. Try interacting with more of the mirrors."
"115740052-0-49502";"Ah, my generous host. I brought you a gift. You'll enjoy watching it fight."
"115740052-0-49503";"Friends, we need to get out of here!"
"115740052-0-49505";"You're not going to let something as simple as an Atronach stand between you and the Blind, are you?"
"115740052-0-49507";"Tutor, take note. We need to acquire one of these shiny Atronachs."
"115740052-0-49508";"The Blind, master. Has she gotten far?"
"115740052-0-49509";"I am curious to see the loom of which Ithelia spoke. Let us proceed."
"115740052-0-49510";"Place the fragment in the center of the ritual circle."
"115740052-0-49511";"Excellent. Now place Abolisher, the Lamp of Clarity, and the Skein of Secrets around the fragment."
"115740052-0-49512";"Now proxy, join your power to mine and we shall align the threads of fate with the ritual."
"115740052-0-49513";"It is done. We have created a Mirror of Truth."
"115740052-0-49514";"It really worked? Maybe we do have a chance."
"115740052-0-49516";"Come, proxy. We must speak."
"115740052-0-49519";"Still alive? My friend can help you with that."
"115740052-0-49521";"My creatures are supposed to slow you down!"
"115740052-0-49522";"Hmm. I am not sure how to proceed and we have no time to wander aimlessly. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can show us the way?"
"115740052-0-49525";"Proxy, look! Another memory. Use the Echonir."
"115740052-0-49526";"Is this another, isolated section of Fargrave, or a pocket dimension within the demiplane?"
"115740052-0-49527";"My Loom of the Untraveled Road fills this place. From its core, I can break the shackles of fate. Undo mistakes. Unlock possibilities. Create new histories."
"115740052-0-49528";"It's magnificent! But won't some Princes see it as a threat?"
"115740052-0-49529";"A threat? This is a gift. The gift of unconstrained choice."
"115740052-0-49530";"The Loom will weave a new story for every being, what they choose to be true. All shall benefit!"
"115740052-0-49531";"A wonderful gift indeed, my Prince!"
"115740052-0-49532";"Ithelia can use the Loom to change history? That is how she will restore what was lost!"
"115740052-0-49537";"This is how it must be, Ithelia. For the sake of reality, you cannot walk free."
"115740052-0-49538";"You cannot contain me forever, Mora. In time, I will escape this cell."
"115740052-0-49539";"No fate that I foresee results in your freedom. I am sorry, Ithelia, but I do this to preserve reality."
"115740052-0-49540";"Hermaeus Mora could not predict what he could not perceive—Ithelia's scions, the Unseen. Come, we must find a way to escape."
"115740052-0-49541";"Hey! Can you see me? I can't find my way out!"
"115740052-0-49546";"Leave me be, you incessant gnat!"
"115740052-0-49548";"Can you hear me? Get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-49549";"Is that Beragon? These ruined mirrors look into different realities. They may be doors to the Many Paths. See if the Lamp of Clarity can free him."
"115740052-0-49550";"Those vines. That's the entrance to the ruins."
"115740052-0-49551";"Thank you, friend! It was a nightmare. I was in a different world."
"115740052-0-49552";"I thought I was never going to get out of there!"
"115740052-0-49553";"If there is no escape by the road Beragon followed, we must continue on. Lead the way, proxy."
"115740052-0-49554";"Take care of this annoying cur! The Echonir awaits."
"115740052-0-49555";"We must find our way to the Loom's core and destroy that infernal machine."
"115740052-0-49556";"Why, mortals? I do this for you. Vargas, protect the Loom!"
"115740052-0-49557";"Vargas, no! Wait, I can set this right."
"115740052-0-49558";"Now, proxy! Use Abolisher to destroy the Loom!"
"115740052-0-49559";"Arggh! My Loom! But the power! Such terrible power!"
"115740052-0-49560";"I am the Last Tomorrow, the Unweaver! I am filled with the power of the Many Paths! Come, Torvesard, away!"
"115740052-0-49561";"Abolisher is depleted, but it did its job. The Loom has been destroyed. I shall open an exit. Let us leave this place."
"115740052-0-49563";"The Echonir is at the back of the Skyvault, master. The Blind won't get it quickly."
"115740052-0-49565";"I'm sure our champion is ready to hunt the Blind regardless of how far into the Skyvault she gets."
"115740052-0-49567";"Sorilen's up ahead. What's she looking at?"
"115740052-0-49568";"Look, tutor! So that's where I put Ukhelzal's head. I expected the Ashpit's champion to last longer."
"115740052-0-49569";"Very good master. I'll make a note."
"115740052-0-49570";"Do you feel it, Beragon? The grandeur of our history?"
"115740052-0-49571";"Why not give them the chance? It will be a good test of the locks and my hints!"
"115740052-0-49572";"That's one of your treasured trinkets, master. Should we tell the champions not to touch it?"
"115740052-0-49573";"The Blind knows her way around this place. Maybe the Echonir calls to her."
"115740052-0-49575";"And be wary of the tharriker. They aren't to be trifled with."
"115740052-0-49578";"There's something I'm supposed to do with it, but I can't quite remember what."
"115740052-0-49579";"The Echonir is just up ahead."
"115740052-0-49581";"That was … incredible! I couldn't take my eyes off your fight. You deserve recognition for that."
"115740052-0-49582";"Master, may I remind you that that is an item of great power."
"115740052-0-49583";"It's a petrified eye, tutor. I want to see what memories it holds."
"115740052-0-49584";"Come, proxy. Things here are more dire than I suspected."
"115740052-0-49585";"Go where I cannot, proxy. Untangle this knot of fate."
"115740052-0-49586";"Mortal, help me. Please."
"115740052-0-49587";"[Dog Barking]"
"115740052-0-49590";"Perhaps you can make sense of it."
"115740052-0-49591";"She's in the first room. I don't think she expected the hall to give her a taste of my arenas."
"115740052-0-49592";"Enjoy the Hall of Barons. You'll love it!"
"115740052-0-49593";"It seems Pelena made her feelings about the cook quite clear to Lady Weatherleah."
"115740052-0-49594";"The gardener found <<1>>'s body? We should speak to him next."
"115740052-0-49595";"Something hides here. I feel its hatred, thick and sour. Perhaps I can call it to us."
"115740052-0-49596";"This place reeks of death. We need to find and burn the bodies fueling the ritual."
"115740052-0-49597";"[Aquilia Screaming]"
"115740052-0-49598";"I've always preferred cats, but you've made a good argument for dogs, Betu."
"115740052-0-49599";"Oh? Well you do seem like a very good boy! I'll be sure to order a lifetime supply of steak dinners!"
"115740052-0-49600";"This one thinks Betu likes you!"
"115740052-0-49601";"You should be able to perceive the threads of fate here. Follow them, proxy."
"115740052-0-49602";"Arkay help us! There is powerful necromantic energy here. We must be near one of the objects from the ritual."
"115740052-0-49604";"We cannot leave any trace of the ritual behind. You must take that scroll!"
"115740052-0-49605";"There is something vile nearby. I sense we are close to a ritual item!"
"115740052-0-49606";"There! That spirit is channeling the ritual. Quickly, find and burn its corpse!"
"115740052-0-49607";"The ritual is gaining strength! Quickly, burn the body!"
"115740052-0-49608";"Over there! Another body is fueling the necrotic ritual. Burn it!"
"115740052-0-49612";"See, Beragon? The Colovians built atop our heritage! They buried it all!"
"115740052-0-49613";"That's how it works, Sorilen. The new replaces the old."
"115740052-0-49614";"I thought I could convince you. That we'd find the wildburn seed together."
"115740052-0-49615";"What? Sorilen, come back!"
"115740052-0-49616";"Now she's up on the ledge!"
"115740052-0-49617";"Join me, Beragon. The Recollection needs Wood Elves like you. We can finally claim our rightful inheritance!"
"115740052-0-49618";"You're with the Recollection? Cracked acorns, what are you thinking? Follow her!"
"115740052-0-49619";"Sorilen, talk to me! I can't let you take that seed."
"115740052-0-49620";"I won't fight you, Beragon. There are other seeds than these."
"115740052-0-49621";"I'll go after her. Grab the seed and follow after me."
"115740052-0-49622";"More tracks! The dog definitely went this way."
"115740052-0-49623";"There's Betu! Quick, grab the will while he is occupied!"
"115740052-0-49627";"There you are! Come here. I have an idea about the Sage's Dream."
"115740052-0-49628";"Apply heat to liquify the harkfruit. Again, not too hot."
"115740052-0-49629";"You should chill the lute berries without freezing them."
"115740052-0-49630";"Now grab the drink and take it to that strange woman. I'll meet you upstairs."
"115740052-0-49631";"The pain is gone and the threads of fate have untangled. What happened in there, proxy?"
"115740052-0-49632";"Another apparition? Oh, you're real. Please, come in. What can I get you?"
"115740052-0-49633";"Over here. I sense a path that wishes to be explored. Shine the lamp, please."
"115740052-0-49634";"A new path appears. Use the Lamp, mortal."
"115740052-0-49635";"I sense this is the last path calling to me. Use the Lamp here, mortal."
"115740052-0-49636";"Step through. Let us see where this path takes us."
"115740052-0-49637";"Step into the Many Paths once again, mortal."
"115740052-0-49638";"I know this! A doorway to the Many Paths. Step through and I will follow."
"115740052-0-49646";"It has to work, Scruut. There are no other options. Ah, here comes our—proxy, where is Gadayn?"
"115740052-0-49647";"It is done. The remaining necromantic energy will dissipate on its own. Meet me outside this cursed place."
"115740052-0-49648";"Do you hear that hiss?"
"115740052-0-49649";"Yes, the will is returned and intact thanks to my assistant."
"115740052-0-49650";"Deputy, over here."
"115740052-0-49651";"Just as I suspected, fresh blood to feed the spell."
"115740052-0-49653";"Enough! Forces of Mirrormoor, aid me!"
"115740052-0-49654";"Oh, Mizzik! Do you have updates on your investigation?"
"115740052-0-49655";"That path leads to the forbidden parts of the realm."
"115740052-0-49656";"Argh! Reality tears, here in Apocrypha! Go on ahead and I'll see if I can do anything to slow them down."
"115740052-0-49657";"Ambush!"
"115740052-0-49658";"We have to help him!"
"115740052-0-49659";"Quickly friend, search the pantry! Mizzik hopes we can save at least one life today."
"115740052-0-49662";"Be careful, that blade has a wicked edge to it."
"115740052-0-49663";"Good work. We should keep moving, there are more undead to exorcise."
"115740052-0-49665";"Good. You cleared the corruption here, but I fear there may be more."
"115740052-0-49666";"Good work. We should not linger here, there is more to do."
"115740052-0-49669";"Do not ask me what is in that bowl. I do not wish to know."
"115740052-0-49672";"I copied myself through the archive. This is not the end of me!"
"115740052-0-49674";"Do not get any ideas. That dagger is tainted."
"115740052-0-49675";"I knew something was off about the Dark Elf expert. Sneaky-looking cur."
"115740052-0-49676";"Hurry, mortals. Ithelia and her scion have breached my private sanctum. Enter the Mythos and aid the One Who Knows."
"115740052-0-49677";"We've lost so many to the traps. Had that fool warned us about them, Givvins would have never been petrified."
"115740052-0-49678";"Look at it, it's marvelous. Floating there, just waiting to be taken! Any final notes, assistant, before I commit history?"
"115740052-0-49680";"I thought I saw a Wood Elf leave the pit with something. But I was trying to help the Initiates."
"115740052-0-49681";"We saw some Recollection in the vault. One of them must have gotten away with it."
"115740052-0-49682";"Take Abolisher if you can, mortal. Ah! No!"
"115740052-0-49683";"Proxy, I am familiar with those relics."
"115740052-0-49684";"The Shardborn are endless, mortal!"
"115740052-0-49685";"Betu! He's recovering. The herbs must be working."
"115740052-0-49686";"Wonderful news. Traveler, let's discuss the note you found with our imposter."
"115740052-0-49687";"Betu, what is it? Where are you going?"
"115740052-0-49688";"Quickly, follow that dog!"
"115740052-0-49690";"An island? Where are we? And who are those warriors?"
"115740052-0-49691";"A demiplane, not an island. We are no longer on Nirn."
"115740052-0-49692";"Torvesard must be near. I doubt the Recollection reached this place without his help."
"115740052-0-49693";"Leramil is exhausted! Go on, find Torvesard. We'll catch up."
"115740052-0-49694";"More! I need more warriors!"
"115740052-0-49695";"Abolisher will be mine again, mortals! We shall definitely meet again!"
"115740052-0-49696";"A permanent portal to the Mythos? I did not know such a thing existed."
"115740052-0-49697";"Chosen of fate, hold. We must speak."
"115740052-0-49698";"The One Who Knows is here! Speak with him, proxy."
"115740052-0-49699";"Agree to sign the confession, Yabren. My patience won't last forever."
"115740052-0-49700";"Give me that. I'll sign her damn name! In case you haven't noticed, we've got company."
"115740052-0-49701";"The deputy! Mercenaries, kill them and dump the elixir into the reservoir! Come, Raxalee. We need to get out of here."
"115740052-0-49702";"I will take back this land for my people! You cannot stop me!"
"115740052-0-49703";"Let's get this over with."
"115740052-0-49704";"I never did like law folk."
"115740052-0-49707";"Let's head into the catacombs beneath these ruins to sort through what we've found, away from this rabble."
"115740052-0-49708";"Majestic! Oh how I'd love to know how they carved these wings. Was it one sculptor? Two? More? It's so lifelike!"
"115740052-0-49709";"Forces of Mirrormoor, protect me!"
"115740052-0-49710";"Something about this awful plane must confuse portal magic. Yes, that's the reason."
"115740052-0-49711";"Hush, assistant. Do you see that ahead? Is that one of the Recollection's own? Turned to stone?"
"115740052-0-49712";"I'm going on ahead, onward to discovery!"
"115740052-0-49714";"We watched the false king enter the ruins but he sent his warriors against us. The tribune drove them back and went in after him!"
"115740052-0-49715";"No, this cannot be my fate …."
"115740052-0-49716";"A cave? I don't see any Recollection. Why would they leave this path unguarded?"
"115740052-0-49717";"The Recollection brings supplies to this gate. The sentries here are predictable. We might be able to slip by them. Or we could try the path to the north, although I don't know where that leads."
"115740052-0-49718";"That's the main gate. Lots of Recollection there. No way we're getting through them without a fight."
"115740052-0-49719";"I am the heir of the Ayleids and the beloved of Ithelia! I will not be denied!"
"115740052-0-49721";"Well done, mortal! That's all of them. Return to me and we can conclude our business."
"115740052-0-49722";"There, friend! Those are the stairs we're looking for."
"115740052-0-49723";"The Great Hall of Niryastare. This is as far as I got on my previous visit."
"115740052-0-49724";"The door to the south leads to Niryastare's vault, but it's sealed by this welkynd stone. Hmm. The Recollection's working on the puzzle. Let's look at their notes."
"115740052-0-49726";"Collapsed stairs? The Ayleids left us one last obstacle … but I think there's another chamber above. Try Abolisher again?"
"115740052-0-49727";"So that's the Skein of Secrets? I wonder what it does. Go ahead and take it—we shouldn't linger here."
"115740052-0-49728";"Over there, friend. Isn't that an Echonir manifestation? We should see what it reveals."
"115740052-0-49729";"Why do you trouble my Prince, Ur-Daedra?"
"115740052-0-49730";"The Many Paths splinter. You manipulate fate in ways that were not meant to be!"
"115740052-0-49731";"What I do I do for the good of all. Why can you not see that, Mora?"
"115740052-0-49732";"I am not alone in my concerns, Ithelia. Constrain yourself or we will constrain you."
"115740052-0-49733";"And you will fail! Now begone!"
"115740052-0-49734";"A memory of Ithelia arguing with Hermaeus Mora! Have you ever seen such a thing? Friend, we should talk."
"115740052-0-49735";"I am Leramil, little Wood Elf. I assume from what we saw in that memory that Torvesard did not find what he was looking for?"
"115740052-0-49736";"Let us speak, proxy."
"115740052-0-49737";"Help! I can't get out. The door's blocked."
"115740052-0-49738";"Thank the Eight! I thought that was my grave."
"115740052-0-49739";"It hurts so much, sister."
"115740052-0-49740";"Thank you. I'm never coming back here."
"115740052-0-49742";"Sealed away, alone for millennia? I will free my Prince and restore her glory!"
"115740052-0-49743";"Help! The vines won't let me go!"
"115740052-0-49744";"Thanks! Even the plants want to kill me!"
"115740052-0-49745";"Head to the market overlook. We'll take stock of the situation there."
"115740052-0-49747";"Another tear! How many wounds can reality sustain?"
"115740052-0-49748";"The light of the Lamp unveiled the way. Keep going, proxy."
"115740052-0-49749";"Damn, they breached the wall. Let's talk strategy, comrade."
"115740052-0-49750";"Tribune! Praise the gods. We could use your help."
"115740052-0-49751";"This is it, the laboratory. We need to destroy it all. Let me explain, friend."
"115740052-0-49752";"The scent wafting off those grapes. It's tantalizing."
"115740052-0-49753";"That must be their commander. Keep low."
"115740052-0-49754";"This fight is far from over!"
"115740052-0-49758";"Careful, stranger. The ones who murdered my friends are close. They may return at any moment."
"115740052-0-49759";"When the seed sprouts, this ancient shrine will awaken. Its power will help fill the well of Miscarcand."
"115740052-0-49760";"That must be one of the wards. Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-49761";"Well done. Let us find the next one."
"115740052-0-49762";"Another ward. Destroy it!"
"115740052-0-49763";"Good work, proxy."
"115740052-0-49764";"With the wards destroyed, the way into Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum should be open now."
"115740052-0-49765";"This place should serve. Tell Nantharion to bring a seed here. And suggest he guard this seed better than the last few."
"115740052-0-49766";"Go. Take your forces and capture the keep. I will gather reinforcements in Mirrormoor."
"115740052-0-49767";"An attack? You dare!"
"115740052-0-49770";"No, no, no! We must get this right before our performance!"
"115740052-0-49771";"I'm all right, tribune. You stopped Nantharion from unleashing that final wildburn on the Weald. Thank you, my friend."
"115740052-0-49772";"We stopped one threat, but did you see? Ithelia … changed."
"115740052-0-49773";"Let's talk about this back in Skingrad, friends."
"115740052-0-49774";"All right, so I will juggle like this. Looking good!"
"115740052-0-49775";"Perhaps I'll ask about the portal later. Right now I want to know if the keep is secure."
"115740052-0-49776";"This dance took many weeks to master. Isn't it stunning?"
"115740052-0-49777";"Another dead end. Use the Lamp and find us a path."
"115740052-0-49778";"Clarity's light reveals the unseen. Let us continue."
"115740052-0-49779";"Sir Klauser, show us your fabulous acting ability!"
"115740052-0-49780";"All right, Lady Sowerra. Begin your routine from the front!"
"115740052-0-49781";"Beautiful Lady Sowerra, start your choreography from the back!"
"115740052-0-49782";"Sir Klauser! I command you to lie perfectly still! Be serene!"
"115740052-0-49783";"Now this will be wonderful! Let us redouble our efforts and practice fervently, now! Thank you for all your advice, friend."
"115740052-0-49788";"Up here, friend!"
"115740052-0-49789";"Just ring the bell in the proper sequence and the alert will be sounded."
"115740052-0-49790";"As I expected, our paths have once more come together. Enter the portal, proxy."
"115740052-0-49791";"Right. From there, we head for Anvil. But it's … oh. Traveler, hello."
"115740052-0-49792";"I can't rutting believe it! Can you rutting believe it, Clen?"
"115740052-0-49793";"Hah! The sooner we get those symbols the faster we can start planning the wedding."
"115740052-0-49794";"Someday we'll have to explore this ruin more completely. Not today though."
"115740052-0-49795";"And finally, Sir Klauser takes his cue! Please, tell me your thoughts."
"115740052-0-49796";"Now! Time to refine Lady Sowerra's performance. Come speak to me."
"115740052-0-49797";"Stand guard, Sir Klauser! This new act requires focus."
"115740052-0-49798";"Remain calm, Lady Sowerra! Perhaps that's enough fire for now."
"115740052-0-49799";"Time for a rest, friends. No need to push ourselves too hard now."
"115740052-0-49800";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-49801";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-49802";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-49803";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-49804";"You won't ruin all my hard work!"
"115740052-0-49805";"Coven, to me!"
"115740052-0-49806";"I told you the fort's seen better days. Let's look around a little."
"115740052-0-49807";"Over there! A wildburn seed—and an Echonir memory, too!"
"115740052-0-49808";"Another seed! Destroy it, friend."
"115740052-0-49809";"Be wary. If I sensed the presence of Daedric power, the Recollection likely noticed it as well."
"115740052-0-49810";"You have become the very threat I foresaw, Ithelia."
"115740052-0-49811";"Can you not see? Reality collapses around you as fate's threads unravel."
"115740052-0-49812";"Stop Ithelia, proxy!"
"115740052-0-49814";"Tribune, get that ballista in working order. Mercenary, you get the fun part."
"115740052-0-49815";"Grab that bucket of oil first."
"115740052-0-49816";"Now pour the oil around the barricades!"
"115740052-0-49817";"Tribune, take lookout. Mercenary, finish repairing the ballista. The parts are by the back wall."
"115740052-0-49818";"That did it! Now arm that ballista, target the oil, and set it ablaze."
"115740052-0-49819";"That should hold them back. Now, crush those Daedra!"
"115740052-0-49821";"Get down there and find out where they're coming from!"
"115740052-0-49822";"That's one of the items the captain sent us for. Let's keep going!"
"115740052-0-49823";"I'm glad I remembered where I stashed that. Only one thing left to find!"
"115740052-0-49824";"Now that we have the sequence, the key, and the payroll, we need to reach the bell tower! It's on the west side of the fort."
"115740052-0-49825";"What do you think is down there?"
"115740052-0-49826";"Rocks."
"115740052-0-49827";"Seriously? That's the best you can do?"
"115740052-0-49828";"All right. One very big rock?"
"115740052-0-49829";"I should've guessed."
"115740052-0-49830";"Aradros is down there somewhere."
"115740052-0-49831";"I meant, like, at the bottom."
"115740052-0-49832";"There's nothing down there but lava."
"115740052-0-49833";"What's that got to do with anything?"
"115740052-0-49834";"Lava cools to rock. The only thing down there is rock. I win."
"115740052-0-49835";"That doesn't count!"
"115740052-0-49836";"These deserters turned bandits have no honor! They killed legionaries for no good reason!"
"115740052-0-49837";"Bears. They can be sly and sneaky, so be on your guard."
"115740052-0-49838";"Think this was here before the Orcs?"
"115740052-0-49839";"The statue?"
"115740052-0-49840";"This hole."
"115740052-0-49841";"Orcs are too boring."
"115740052-0-49842";"What does that have to do with anything?"
"115740052-0-49843";"Where are they taking all those hoarvors?"
"115740052-0-49844";"Resupply?"
"115740052-0-49845";"What? Don't we have horses?"
"115740052-0-49846";"Meat has to dry first."
"115740052-0-49847";"Oh. Ooh."
"115740052-0-49849";"So, what do we do if the Orcs say yes?"
"115740052-0-49850";"Fill our ranks."
"115740052-0-49851";"Won't that be a problem?"
"115740052-0-49852";"What do you mean?"
"115740052-0-49853";"We did just kill most of them. Won't the survivors be mad?"
"115740052-0-49854";"They'll be with us. Besides, we still outnumber them. There won't be a problem."
"115740052-0-49861";"I can see why this is called the pit."
"115740052-0-49862";"Orcs are very literal."
"115740052-0-49863";"It's a bit big for a pit, don't you think?"
"115740052-0-49866";"Would you prefer they called it the Oathsworn Chasm?"
"115740052-0-49867";"That doesn't sound very Orc-ish."
"115740052-0-49868";"Well, then why'd you bring it up?"
"115740052-0-49869";"Just an observation. Don't tell me you weren't thinking the same thing."
"115740052-0-49870";"I wasn't thinking the same thing."
"115740052-0-49871";"The Recollection made it this far, but they have met some of Elenglynn's dangers."
"115740052-0-49872";"Welkynd stones? Ayleids were fascinated with the magic of light, but this is not what we seek. Let us press on."
"115740052-0-49873";"There! The maze is below. The way to Elenglynn's shrine lies through the heart of the maze."
"115740052-0-49874";"The Blind isn't here. Enjoy the magnificent view if you must."
"115740052-0-49875";"My Barons Who Move Like This fought the air here. It was invigorating!"
"115740052-0-49876";"There's no way forward. But you may as well look around before turning back."
"115740052-0-49877";"Is this a part of your cunning strategy? Finding locations with interesting vistas to admire?"
"115740052-0-49878";"I believe this is my favorite dead end, tutor."
"115740052-0-49879";"Oh. Oh ooo. Traveler, can you stop? I'm very lost. And a bit woozy."
"115740052-0-49880";"There, the maze is below! At the heart of that maze is the way forward."
"115740052-0-49881";"The heart of the maze! Our way forward lies within, proxy."
"115740052-0-49882";"To what end? As long as I remain in this reality, the threat I pose persists. My power will always find a way to return to me. Such is the nature of our princely dispositions."
"115740052-0-49883";"I sense an anomaly here, proxy. A place where the veil between realms can be parted. Perhaps Abolisher can be of use?"
"115740052-0-49884";"The threads of fate agree with you, but what choice do we have? You are Daedra. Immortal. Forever. I see no other path before us."
"115740052-0-49885";"The chamber to the north should be the heart of the maze. But it seems we must find another entrance."
"115740052-0-49886";"Now, you have shown we who are called Daedric Princes that there are always possibilities. Even for us. Farewell, mortal."
"115740052-0-49887";"Now leave this place, mortals! And understand that you go with the gratitude of the One Who Knows."
"115740052-0-49889";"The Legion doesn't know what happened here."
"115740052-0-49890";"Thank you! I hope I remember all this in the morning because you're my new best friend. I love friends so much."
"115740052-0-49891";"The captain won't send us back in there, will he?"
"115740052-0-49892";"How's your leg?"
"115740052-0-49893";"Augh … bad. I can't stand."
"115740052-0-49894";"Stop faking. We're not going back in there."
"115740052-0-49896";"I don't think he'll survive."
"115740052-0-49897";"Now, dead creature! Prepare to rise again!"
"115740052-0-49898";"We need to reach the north, south, and east sections of the fort to find the items."
"115740052-0-49899";"Almost there. Just a little farther and then we can ring the warning bell!"
"115740052-0-49900";"This is what the Skein wanted us to find. A portal recently used by Ithelia and reopened by Abolisher."
"115740052-0-49901";"But a portal to where?"
"115740052-0-49903";"Here goes nothing! I command thee, lesser creature, to rise!"
"115740052-0-49904";"Oh no no! Get away! Why won't you obey me?!"
"115740052-0-49905";"Does it matter? Wherever it leads, that's where we need to go."
"115740052-0-49906";"Come. Tell me your thoughts, deputy."
"115740052-0-49907";"The Recollection is here, all right. Be ready for trouble."
"115740052-0-49908";"Perhaps I'll try this experiment again in the future, after I learn a bit more."
"115740052-0-49909";"A lingering memory? Use the Echonir, proxy."
"115740052-0-49910";"Deputy, you stop the mercenaries. I'll go after Carvain and Raxalee."
"115740052-0-49911";"Your wanderings are futile, Torvesard. What you seek is here. The Loom of the Untraveled Road. I have no idea what it is, but I am certain it's important."
"115740052-0-49912";"You can stare at the sealed portal until you go mad, Vargas. I go in search of my missing memories."
"115740052-0-49914";"Was that a memory from the Merethic Era? Never mind that, who's this High Elf?"
"115740052-0-49916";"Come, little ones! Whisper to me the secrets of the Green."
"115740052-0-49917";"Marius? You're with these … these … deserters?"
"115740052-0-49921";"So it was true. Marius Gallo, hero of Ontus … a deserter and a bandit."
"115740052-0-49923";"Until we meet again, wanderer."
"115740052-0-49924";"I hope you're prepared for my Trial of Blood!"
"115740052-0-49925";"Health does not determine the victor, blood does."
"115740052-0-49926";"Face me and my Trial of Conquest!"
"115740052-0-49927";"I'm almost through. But, do you control the territory?"
"115740052-0-49928";"Face me and my Trial of War!"
"115740052-0-49929";"Better hope you have enough atronachs to win this."
"115740052-0-49930";"Lost? How can we be lost? We make this trip every year."
"115740052-0-49931";"Give me a moment to get my bearings. This wouldn't have happened if we weren't debating all the time. It distracts me."
"115740052-0-49932";"Why would fate lead us to an abandoned shrine? There must be something here."
"115740052-0-49933";"Well, I just figured out where we need to go. But I am excited that this stranger wants to enter the debate now!"
"115740052-0-49937";"Let's get moving, Agmund. If we're lucky, there'll be sweet rolls available at the bakery by the time we arrive."
"115740052-0-49938";"Oh thank the Eight. I was going to say the same thing, Isayas.\n\nBye, traveler! Thanks for the help!"
"115740052-0-49939";"Wisteria can be a bit cold, so let me …. Wait. They're not here? Let's look around."
"115740052-0-49940";"Hyacinth is an accomplished mage, loves poking around in old ruins. This little bit of spellcraft is his work."
"115740052-0-49941";"That note's barely legible. Looks like the monkeys got at it."
"115740052-0-49942";"That charm belongs to Oleander. He says it brings him luck. He'd never just leave it behind."
"115740052-0-49943";"I didn't … Hah. I've never done that. The ice trap must have messed with the spell. You talk to him while I try to fix it."
"115740052-0-49944";"There, just ahead. Give me a moment."
"115740052-0-49945";"She's alive!"
"115740052-0-49946";"You're hurt! What did they do to you?"
"115740052-0-49948";"Hold that thought, Isayas. I just came up with a rebuttal to the Mundus-Lachrymose theory. That old buffoon from Auridon won't be able to get around this."
"115740052-0-49949";"Fine, fine. I'lll keep myself occupied with our newly-arrived friend, here."
"115740052-0-49951";"The relics, Mora's spell, and my magic together shall help you repair reality, proxy."
"115740052-0-49952";"Scruut, Tribune Alea, and I will meet you at the sites, friend."
"115740052-0-49954";"Krin'ze! Are you all right?"
"115740052-0-49955";"I will be fine. We must go after the others!"
"115740052-0-49956";"We will handle it. Join us when you have recovered."
"115740052-0-49957";"No! The spell isn't complete!"
"115740052-0-49958";"Flesh of the body, bones of the dead! Blood of the heart, awaken the grave!"
"115740052-0-49959";"That did it! The vault is unlocked. We'd better go in before the Recollection notices."
"115740052-0-49960";"They must have taken the Staff of Many Paths."
"115740052-0-49961";"A fallen star is an omen of someone in need."
"115740052-0-49962";"Priorities, my sahida. The answer is no."
"115740052-0-49963";"We have greater concerns. Let someone else see to your fallen star."
"115740052-0-49965";"Here, comrade. This is the spot Scruut indicated."
"115740052-0-49966";"I'll never get used to those tears in the air. Place the Lamp of Clarity beneath it."
"115740052-0-49967";"Now use the spell scroll Scruut provided to release the Lamp's energy!"
"115740052-0-49968";"Look! The tear! It's closing!"
"115740052-0-49969";"I think it worked, comrade!"
"115740052-0-49970";"That was the last of the relics? Then let's head back to Beragon's townhouse."
"115740052-0-49971";"About time someone got here."
"115740052-0-49972";"Of course the Blind Path couldn't get past my locks. Even I had to leave myself hints!"
"115740052-0-49973";"Stumped? You didn't even get the corner pieces right!"
"115740052-0-49974";"There are two crystals. Have you tried using them both?"
"115740052-0-49975";"Make sure you have the line you want to eliminate before using the selection button."
"115740052-0-49976";"The lock's open! Claim your prize. It'll help you in the future. Anything else up there is yours as well."
"115740052-0-49977";"I locked up this treasure and forgot about it. Maybe I'll remember what it is when you free it."
"115740052-0-49978";"That didn't look too difficult. Feel free to claim the treasure for yourself and use it against the Blind."
"115740052-0-49979";"This is the most fiendish lock built to hold a very powerful trinket. Think you can unlock it?"
"115740052-0-49980";"Oh. This is one of my favorite pieces. Use it in the fight against the Blind, you'll see why. And don't forget to collect your spoils."
"115740052-0-49981";"Dulzush isn't as strong as she once was. I'll guard her, you deal with the Elf."
"115740052-0-49982";"Here, friend! This is the cave Scruut indicated."
"115740052-0-49983";"Bogcup? I can't see you. Did you crack the magicka lattice sitting on it again?"
"115740052-0-49984";"A reality tear. I hate those things! Place Abolisher near it—but not too close!"
"115740052-0-49985";"Now use Scruut's spell scroll!"
"115740052-0-49986";"I think that did it!"
"115740052-0-49987";"I much prefer the space above me to be hole free! Go finish the task and I'll see you back in Skingrad."
"115740052-0-49988";"That was the last relic, right? Let's head back to my townhouse and meet up with the others."
"115740052-0-49989";"Come, mortal. Let's finish this so I can get back to my usual, boring routine."
"115740052-0-49990";"Place the Skein of Secrets near the reality tear."
"115740052-0-49991";"Now use the spell scroll to release the relic's energy."
"115740052-0-49992";"It actually worked!"
"115740052-0-49993";"That's that last of the relics! I can feel reality healing and it feels glorious! Let's return to Beragon's and check in with Leramil."
"115740052-0-49994";"Wait, what? Who is this?"
"115740052-0-49995";"Toothmaul Gully? That wasn't …. Never mind."
"115740052-0-49996";"The gate's blocked by rubble. I think Abolisher might help us here."
"115740052-0-49997";"That's the balcony beyond the gate mentioned in the Recollection notes. Try Abolisher here."
"115740052-0-49998";"This must be the pit mentioned in the Recollection note. Can we use Abolisher here?"
"115740052-0-49999";"My preparations are complete. The barrier will crumble and I will take the Echonir for my Prince!"
"115740052-0-50000";"Die already!"
"115740052-0-50001";"My spell destroys everything in my way!"
"115740052-0-50004";"You insist on dying for that fool's amusement?"
"115740052-0-50005";"And you insist on dying for an impossible cause."
"115740052-0-50006";"I will take the Echonir, and nothing will stop me!"
"115740052-0-50007";"Prepare to be disappointed."
"115740052-0-50008";"You will not prevent me from reaching my goal."
"115740052-0-50009";"Set your goals lower. Preferably in a different domain."
"115740052-0-50010";"She doesn't seem that strong."
"115740052-0-50011";"Fight me yourself, if you're so confident. Otherwise let me concentrate!"
"115740052-0-50012";"I hope this is as entertaining as the last fights."
"115740052-0-50013";"I'll entertain you with their defeat."
"115740052-0-50014";"Gaar Toor Nah!"
"115740052-0-50015";"Such skilled competitors. This will be a good fight!"
"115740052-0-50016";"It will be better without your incessant interruptions!"
"115740052-0-50017";"Fus Ro Dah!"
"115740052-0-50018";"Fus Ro Dah!"
"115740052-0-50019";"Fus Ro Dah!"
"115740052-0-50021";"Strun Bah Qo!"
"115740052-0-50028";"Up ahead! I think I see the shrine!"
"115740052-0-50029";"Just have to unfurl the wings. It's already charged with magicka."
"115740052-0-50030";"Hello? Is someone there?"
"115740052-0-50031";"These crystals definitely signal Ithelia's presence. See where they lead, proxy."
"115740052-0-50032";"Now pour in the resonating fluid and get ready to move."
"115740052-0-50033";"This is it. Wisteria must be just beyond this door."
"115740052-0-50035";"Someone attacked the servant this belonged to."
"115740052-0-50036";"Servants light this when there's danger. To warn others away."
"115740052-0-50037";"The captain planned to hide. But where?"
"115740052-0-50038";"We need to find Captain Leronus. Meet me at the barracks on the south side of the estate."
"115740052-0-50039";"Mortal, Hermaeus Mora demands an audience when you finish talking to your allies. This portal will take you to him."
"115740052-0-50043";"Come here, assistant. Let's take a better look at those documents."
"115740052-0-50044";"We're here thanks to my new friend. Talk to them for a moment while I work on this lock."
"115740052-0-50045";"Tan, if I'd known a broken rib would get you to fawn over me, I'd have done this ages ago."
"115740052-0-50046";"Do you see Wisteria anywhere?"
"115740052-0-50047";"Ugh, that's Skeever musk. No wonder it reeks in here. Yech."
"115740052-0-50048";"Careful. Those pods release paralytic spores. Nasty stuff."
"115740052-0-50049";"Forward!"
"115740052-0-50050";"A fate forged the moment Torvesard opened the first glyphic and began to remember. Return to the Mythos Vault, mortal. We must speak."
"115740052-0-50055";"Over here, my friend! We have more work to do!"
"115740052-0-50057";"Right. Lead the way, traveler. The door just down the hall here."
"115740052-0-50058";"I want no war with Vashabar, but Nantharion left Ostumir in ruins and killed our people."
"115740052-0-50059";"Nantharion betrayed all we hold sacred, Count Calantius. And he has paid for his crimes with his life."
"115740052-0-50060";"We cannot return Dawnwood to the seed it sprang from. But we, too, seek peace. We shall do everything we can to prove ourselves friends and allies to the Weald."
"115740052-0-50062";"I don't think we're done with Ithelia, comrades."
"115740052-0-50063";"I think Ithelia has other concerns, which may become our problem later. For now, let's enjoy our victory."
"115740052-0-50064";"Beware! Shardmarshal Vargas is above you!"
"115740052-0-50065";"The threads of fate surrounding Fargrave are in turmoil. Something significant shall soon occur."
"115740052-0-50066";"Now! Destroy the wildburn seed!"
"115740052-0-50068";"Vargas banished our allies into the Many Paths. It took everything I had just to shield us."
"115740052-0-50069";"Hmm. I think the order of the symbols is important, proxy."
"115740052-0-50071";"Hurry, now. The portal I opened should carry us as far as the Loom's core."
"115740052-0-50074";"Ithelia does not wish to be disturbed. Rot in the very prison that held her for all those eons!"
"115740052-0-50075";"Vargas diverted my portal! She trapped us in Ithelia's prison. Look for a way out, proxy!"
"115740052-0-50076";"I see a memory. Use the Echonir."
"115740052-0-50077";"I'll try to decipher the map later. Keep going, friends. We can't let the Recollection take the king hostage!"
"115740052-0-50078";"They've probably already got him. I doubt Nantharion's sentries could fight off a Recollection army."
"115740052-0-50079";"No. The Dark Moon temple … it is gone?"
"115740052-0-50080";"Skooma-addled old stray. Have you been asleep these past three hundred years?"
"115740052-0-50081";"Longer than that, perhaps. Speak plainly."
"115740052-0-50082";"No one favors the Dark Moon anymore. Ill omens, forgotten manes, ancient rites. The unified Elsweyr has no need of these outdated traditions."
"115740052-0-50083";"The Sugar God rules the sands now. Riddle'Thar, they call it. Imagine that! Old Baan Dar managed to trick the world."
"115740052-0-50084";"Tanlorin. I'm sorry about Oleander."
"115740052-0-50085";"You're hurt and you're the one apologizing? I'll mourn Oleander soon enough. Right now, I'm just happy you're safe."
"115740052-0-50086";"Tan, these people? They're dangerous. Promise me you'll keep clear of them."
"115740052-0-50088";"I'll be fine. I learned from the best, after all."
"115740052-0-50089";"Hyacinth! We need to talk about the Auridon mission. Hyacinth?"
"115740052-0-50090";"The place looks ransacked. And by Auri-El, what's that smell?"
"115740052-0-50091";"Aww! Hyacinth took my pocket ballista idea seriously!"
"115740052-0-50092";"Hyacinth! Hold on, we're here to save you!"
"115740052-0-50094";"I can weaken the ward holding Hyacinth, but I need you to deactivate the control pillars!"
"115740052-0-50095";"Those crates. That has to be one of the weapon stockpiles. Place the components and I'll do the rest."
"115740052-0-50096";"Place the components and I'll add the spark."
"115740052-0-50097";"Mora dares? Damn his eyes, every one of them!"
"115740052-0-50098";"He wanted a monster? Behold, the Last Tomorrow! Behold, the Destroyer of Reality!"
"115740052-0-50100";"Come on, Hyacinth. I can't lose you, too."
"115740052-0-50101";"Maerenah … what's happening to me, Maer?"
"115740052-0-50102";"It will be all right, Tham. You'll be all right."
"115740052-0-50103";"Check on Tham, friend. I … I need a moment."
"115740052-0-50104";"A dead Ceythalmor agent pinned to the shelves? That's got to be Hyacinth's handiwork!"
"115740052-0-50105";"Hear that? Bloodfiends beyond that door! Place a combustion canister and step back!"
"115740052-0-50107";"Mind your step. The place is a bit of a mess thanks to that portal."
"115740052-0-50108";"Over there! What a sad looking banner. That must be our way in."
"115740052-0-50109";"We need to stop them!"
"115740052-0-50110";"Bogcup, help me. I'm so cold."
"115740052-0-50114";"I'm free! Thank you. Thank you both."
"115740052-0-50115";"I could never have saved you without my friend here. You've, um, already met."
"115740052-0-50116";"Yes, your friend. We met through the lattice. Please, let's talk a moment."
"115740052-0-50117";"Bogcup, we should return to the Greenhouse. I need to recover and bolster my wards."
"115740052-0-50119";"Over here, friend! I assume you got everything we need?"
"115740052-0-50120";"Just need to muddle the petals, mix in the silver and oil … and there! Done!"
"115740052-0-50121";"Grab the fluid and meet me at Toothmaul Gully. Wait until you meet the others! How exciting!"
"115740052-0-50122";"Let's find a spot to activate the tracker fly."
"115740052-0-50123";"They did not just let this temple crumble, did they? This new faith tore it down and let the sea wash it away."
"115740052-0-50124";"What's happening? My work's not done!"
"115740052-0-50125";"Suckle the teat of the blood-soaked ground! Return from the grave, my call will sound!"
"115740052-0-50126";"Wretched mortals! I'm not finished!"
"115740052-0-50127";"Arise, you sleeping dead! Walk among the living instead!"
"115740052-0-50128";"There, I can see Hyacinth through the bars. Let's get in there!"
"115740052-0-50129";"There is more work to be done at home. I must return. Arkay bless you, traveler!"
"115740052-0-50130";"Good to know I was right about the portal. Let's figure out where we are and find the source of all this unstable magic."
"115740052-0-50131";"This architecture is Elven. We must still be near Summerset."
"115740052-0-50132";"Do you feel that surge of magic? We're getting close."
"115740052-0-50133";"This is all that remains of Rawl'kha? What happened to my city?"
"115740052-0-50134";"Eyes of Magnus! Where are we? What is this place?"
"115740052-0-50135";"The new forest worries me. Nothing natural ever grew that quickly!"
"115740052-0-50136";"It's those Wood Elves! Valenwood is trying to annex territory that is rightfully ours!"
"115740052-0-50137";"I'll handle things here. Shut those doors!"
"115740052-0-50138";"The Terror will make you pay for destroying our weapons, Maerenah!"
"115740052-0-50139";"That's not all I plan to destroy, you bastards."
"115740052-0-50140";"The door should be around the back of the temple on the southeast side."
"115740052-0-50141";"Or perhaps the years have turned it into a sugar stall. We will see."
"115740052-0-50142";"Do you have the strength to seek me out?"
"115740052-0-50144";"It's been too long since someone basked in my presence."
"115740052-0-50146";"Two moons ascend this star-pocked night. One a Lamp, and one her light."
"115740052-0-50147";"Hello? Oh no. Is someone there?"
"115740052-0-50148";"Adventurer! I need you up here. Now!"
"115740052-0-50149";"Did you hear? The king of Vashabar, he's the leader of the Recollection!"
"115740052-0-50150";"I knew those Vashabar Wood Elves were to blame for all this!"
"115740052-0-50151";"The ritual already awoke some of the dead within these ruins. We must be quick!"
"115740052-0-50152";"Watch out! The necromantic forces are strong here!"
"115740052-0-50153";"Hurry! The force of the ritual may bring the ruins down on top of us!"
"115740052-0-50154";"Don't mind the sparkles, just reach in and grab the note!"
"115740052-0-50155";"Be careful. We are not safe inside these ruins."
"115740052-0-50156";"Why should we care what the Colovians think? Dawnwood is a miracle and it's ours!"
"115740052-0-50157";"But aren't you curious where it came from? Forests like this don't usually spring up so quickly."
"115740052-0-50158";"King Nantharion says the forest's a gift of the Green and I believe him!"
"115740052-0-50159";"And what about the devastated region between Dawnwood and the rest of the Weald. They blame us for that, I hear."
"115740052-0-50166";"So it was the king all along! How did we miss that?"
"115740052-0-50167";"The entrance is here."
"115740052-0-50168";"See how it opens? It recognizes me as a member of the order."
"115740052-0-50169";"No longer a sanctuary. Now a tomb."
"115740052-0-50170";"You're just going to take what's-his-name's word for it? The Elf who colludes with Imperials?"
"115740052-0-50171";"Well, Greenspeaker Darolith believes Beragon."
"115740052-0-50172";"I had hoped, with Rawl'kha still standing … but, no. The Order of the Hidden Moon is no more."
"115740052-0-50173";"I'm not sure what to believe. Is there any evidence?"
"115740052-0-50174";"Go look at Hoperoot. There's your evidence!"
"115740052-0-50175";"Hmm. Well, this is peculiar. The Echonir can't stay here, but I know who it should go to."
"115740052-0-50180";"Meddlers! Thieves! What have you done to my altar?"
"115740052-0-50182";"We were just trying to calm things down. Who in Oblivion are you?"
"115740052-0-50186";"Yes, good! Bring the crystal to the altar. Place it in the empty locus."
"115740052-0-50188";"Well done. Let's talk about what comes next."
"115740052-0-50189";"Hang on. What just happened?"
"115740052-0-50190";"Pour the water into the ritual basin and I will perform the rite."
"115740052-0-50195";"I just heard the news. King Nantharion was killed, defeated by the Legion's mercenary!"
"115740052-0-50196";"And did you hear? The Recollection worships some forgotten Daedric Prince. That's why we're seeing so many Daedra!"
"115740052-0-50198";"They say Nantharion is dead. I … I don't know how I feel about that."
"115740052-0-50199";"He led us here under false pretenses and killed a lot of people. I know exactly how I feel."
"115740052-0-50200";"But we believed in him once. He inspired us!"
"115740052-0-50201";"And a strangler's maw looks inviting, but I don't want to get eaten!"
"115740052-0-50213";"There's the ruins. And look! I'd call that an islet."
"115740052-0-50216";"We're running out of time. We have to hurry!"
"115740052-0-50223";"Maybe a real peace with Skingrad is possible now. A friendship, even."
"115740052-0-50224";"Peace with the Weald is all well and good, but what about Vashabar? Are we sure there's not another Nantharion lurking in the leaves?"
"115740052-0-50227";"There will always be spoiled fruit on the tree. That's the way of things."
"115740052-0-50235";"Am I forgetting something? It feels like I'm forgetting something."
"115740052-0-50236";"It can't be as important as my news! They threw a celebration for the hero of West Weald!"
"115740052-0-50237";"Ugh! You flung a pie at me! I hate pie!"
"115740052-0-50238";"What'd you find? Is that a map of some sort?"
"115740052-0-50241";"Shake the fear from your heart, ja'rithantii. We will see your cantors saved."
"115740052-0-50242";"But the Rajaska! Do you have a death-wish?"
"115740052-0-50243";"We are on the same side, sister Viti. Remember that when next you give testament to the Inquisitors."
"115740052-0-50246";"No. I have faith."
"115740052-0-50248";"Arrgh! Pie filling in my eye! And do I taste gorapple? Gorapple gives me hives!"
"115740052-0-50249";"Let's rally at the Stonechip Tavern when you're done, deputy."
"115740052-0-50250";"Listen, I have a boat tucked away on the Skywatch docks. We can use it to get to Greenshade, if you need it."
"115740052-0-50252";"One bloodfiend den taken care of. There's probably one more. Let's go find it."
"115740052-0-50253";"Balandrus is finished and the Terror is no more. I saw Tham run out when the battle started. Let's head outside."
"115740052-0-50254";"Come back to join the slaughter, Maerenah?"
"115740052-0-50255";"Gods, Balandrus! What have you become? Friend, attack!"
"115740052-0-50256";"Told you there was a spare key. Now let's go down and open that vault."
"115740052-0-50257";"Stay alert. Just one clue from here will point us in the right direction."
"115740052-0-50258";"Wait … you can't just leave me here!"
"115740052-0-50259";"Oh, yes, I can. Stop complaining and maybe you can free yourself before the vampires return."
"115740052-0-50260";"Balandrus doesn't need you anymore, Maerenah. You've been replaced."
"115740052-0-50261";"Tham the barkeep will be a much better vampire than you ever were."
"115740052-0-50262";"The bastards turned Tham? Hurry, I hear more bloodfiends. Place the combustion canister and stand clear."
"115740052-0-50263";"Here we go."
"115740052-0-50264";"It's happening again! Brace yourself!"
"115740052-0-50265";"That blast reawakened some latent magic in here. Look around while I get this thing under control."
"115740052-0-50266";"This thing's as stable as I can make it. Let's head in before another surge of magic!"
"115740052-0-50267";"Over here! Get me out of these bonds!"
"115740052-0-50268";"Why did we leave Hammerfell, Cirthan?"
"115740052-0-50269";"You know why we left, my love."
"115740052-0-50270";"But all we found here was hard work and terrible sickness."
"115740052-0-50271";"Hard work is the same all over, and the illness will pass."
"115740052-0-50272";"I haven't lived among the Tree Folk for some time, but I can't believe the latest rumors."
"115740052-0-50273";"True or not, it does not matter. You are not one of them, Cirthan."
"115740052-0-50274";"It matters to the other quarriers, my love. And to the ranch hands."
"115740052-0-50275";"We should not care what they think. And we should not care what happens in the new forest."
"115740052-0-50276";"Did you hear, my love? Constable Yabren and the new deputy saved Ontus!"
"115740052-0-50277";"Yes! And I heard Carvain and Raxalee were sent to the count's dungeons!"
"115740052-0-50278";"The dungeons? They should face an executioner's ax for what they did!"
"115740052-0-50279";"I just hope this is the start of better things for Ontus."
"115740052-0-50284";"The news out of Skingrad is wonderful! The Recollection has been defeated!"
"115740052-0-50285";"Even better, the count and the greenspeaker are talking. Peace with the Wood Elves would be an excellent thing."
"115740052-0-50286";"I am just glad that conditions at the ranch have improved."
"115740052-0-50287";"Same at the quarry. Things are finally looking up for us, my love."
"115740052-0-50288";"I hope so, Cirthan. I hope so."
"115740052-0-50290";"The anchors! Stop them!"
"115740052-0-50291";"Damned … mercenaries … got the drop on me."
"115740052-0-50292";"Gaius? Are you here? It's Tribune Alea."
"115740052-0-50293";"Why attack Varen's Watch, Elf? How many warriors do you have in there?"
"115740052-0-50294";"We remember! We will never forget!"
"115740052-0-50296";"This one will tell us nothing."
"115740052-0-50297";"The Recollection easily took your silly fortress!"
"115740052-0-50298";"Damn Wood Elf!"
"115740052-0-50299";"Hey, the signal fires! They're lit!"
"115740052-0-50300";"What? That's impossible!"
"115740052-0-50301";"We are the Legion! Anything's possible!"
"115740052-0-50302";"And friend, remember what I said. Call on me anytime. I owe you and it would be fun!"
"115740052-0-50303";"Those mushrooms form a ring! This must be the place!"
"115740052-0-50304";"More sparkles! Ooo, is that another note?"
"115740052-0-50306";"Add the sugar and flour. Twelve eggs. Whisk three times, no more, no less. Just like father!"
"115740052-0-50307";"Excellent. Ulfsild's annotations will tell you where you need to go."
"115740052-0-50308";"Out of the oven and—perfect! All it needed was to fling some pies and meet you, my friend."
"115740052-0-50313";"Look, a sparkly bird! Check it out, friend."
"115740052-0-50314";"Seek a ritual recorded in ancient stone, weary traveler."
"115740052-0-50315";"It worked. And Abolisher appears unaffected for now. Let us leave this place!"
"115740052-0-50316";"Rest you shall find, behind an egress revealed by royal lavender."
"115740052-0-50318";"Vargas, draw on my power! Defend the Loom!"
"115740052-0-50320";"It is done. The Loom is shattered beyond repair. I'll summon a portal to leave this place."
"115740052-0-50321";"You did it, friend! But what's happening to Ithelia?"
"115740052-0-50322";"Ithelia has become … something else."
"115740052-0-50325";"Now I can undo my long imprisonment. Make it so I was never forgotten."
"115740052-0-50326";"I can find a path in which the Princes and I were never in conflict. And with the Loom, I shall weave it into this reality!"
"115740052-0-50328";"There you are! We were separated in the portal somehow."
"115740052-0-50333";"I never thought I'd be so happy to hear the ringing of a bell!"
"115740052-0-50335";"Grab the map and let's go. We need that key."
"115740052-0-50336";"Here we are! Where the fabled chase began."
"115740052-0-50337";"There, the Ritual Stone is just up the hill. Let's look around for some royal lavender."
"115740052-0-50338";"See that bowl? That's got to be the Gardener's handiwork. Place the lavender in it and let's see what happens."
"115740052-0-50339";"The Rustwall gardens. Our map indicates a spot on the western side."
"115740052-0-50340";"These insects, they're from deep underground. What drove them to the surface?"
"115740052-0-50341";"There. That's the statue marked on the map. Search for the hidden key."
"115740052-0-50342";"Move out! We need to find my cohort."
"115740052-0-50343";"That Wood Elf, he's with the Recollection. And he's taking orders from a Dremora? What's going on here?"
"115740052-0-50344";"This furniture was meant for the comfort of dignitaries who took refuge here, not for these Recollection bastards."
"115740052-0-50345";"Down into the ruins! We've got to close that portal."
"115740052-0-50346";"Pardon the mess. I'm still unpacking."
"115740052-0-50348";"Caepio said the Daedric portal was to the east."
"115740052-0-50350";"Ah! Excellent! My notes on the Five Loyal Retainers. You know, it would do you well to study these notes—they might come in handy some day."
"115740052-0-50352";"Yes, well, my alliance with the Recollection was a bit … tenuous, at best."
"115740052-0-50354";"I can't believe they're complaining about me! Me! After all I did for them! Fine. Be that way."
"115740052-0-50356";"Read this! They say I prattle. I don't prattle. I offer my wisdom, calmly and reasonably. They should've been grateful."
"115740052-0-50357";"The first key fragment is yours. Well done!"
"115740052-0-50358";"The wildburn was not kind to this place. Let's locate the shrine, but remain vigilant."
"115740052-0-50359";"The shrine of Azura should be just up ahead."
"115740052-0-50360";"Kwama always make me uncomfortable. Let's find the forge and get out of here."
"115740052-0-50361";"The forge should be around here somewhere."
"115740052-0-50362";"Fathoms Drift … imagine the horrors that have washed upon its shores."
"115740052-0-50366";"The Ceythalmor will almost certainly be watching. Tread carefully."
"115740052-0-50367";"You get to meet Snapdragon! Oh, I miss her. This is going to be great."
"115740052-0-50369";"Welcome to my domain, adventurer. Bearer of my fable."
"115740052-0-50370";"Ahh. It's good to taste the ink of the Scholarium upon the air again."
"115740052-0-50372";"Can I offer you a glass of our new Vesper Valente?"
"115740052-0-50373";"And here we are! The Emblem! But it is sealed away by magic. Surely these tiles, pressed in correct sequence, will remove the warding spells on it."
"115740052-0-50374";"Good, you found it. Place used to be crawling with Goblins. Let's see what's in here now."
"115740052-0-50375";"Certainly. I'm very curious about this wine."
"115740052-0-50376";"You're back! Tell me what you found."
"115740052-0-50377";"Look! There's a passage behind that rubble."
"115740052-0-50378";"There's a key sitting on that desk. Take it and see if it unlocks any of the drawers."
"115740052-0-50379";"Hmm. Not for that desk? Then let's find the lock that key opens."
"115740052-0-50380";"They're after us! And Ghrakug! I'll go warn him. You destroy this alchemical equipment."
"115740052-0-50381";"Now, if I were a local Reeve with corrupt tendencies, where would I hide my secrets?"
"115740052-0-50382";"A loose wall panel? The sure sign of a hidey-hole!"
"115740052-0-50383";"Told you! These types always have something to hide!"
"115740052-0-50387";"I can contact Hyacinth through my lattice, but I'll need you to talk to him. Just be a moment."
"115740052-0-50388";"Really? You're the first of Lord Valente's guests to accept the wine. I hope you enjoy it."
"115740052-0-50390";"My power abandons me here. I will follow if I can."
"115740052-0-50391";"Why does Boethra want this temple to remain intact, sisters?"
"115740052-0-50392";"Do not question the Warrior of the East and West, my sisters. Now, back to Do'Krin."
"115740052-0-50393";"Ah, Bogcup. Have you located Snapdragon?"
"115740052-0-50397";"Ah, there you are. We should investigate Zeggar's Blind next."
"115740052-0-50398";"Come along. The tasting rooms are just a little farther in."
"115740052-0-50399";"Take care not to disturb the sand, if you please."
"115740052-0-50400";"Everything will be fine, Bogcup. Friend of Bogcup, a word."
"115740052-0-50402";"Give me more time, I can figure out what's upsetting them. I can calm them down!"
"115740052-0-50403";"They have tasting rooms?"
"115740052-0-50404";"Friend, you're needed again!"
"115740052-0-50405";"You again! What are you doing in my husband's office?"
"115740052-0-50406";"I recognize a few of these runes. What are you planning, Hyacinth?"
"115740052-0-50408";"Make sure you do. I have no intent to serve as a wine glass for my husband!"
"115740052-0-50409";"Ursilia. I suppose I owe you an explanation."
"115740052-0-50410";"I am so mad at you right now, Hyacinth."
"115740052-0-50413";"Of course you do, but I don't care. Just talk to your friend and deal with my husband."
"115740052-0-50414";"All right, if you say so …."
"115740052-0-50415";"A Goblin just attacked me, Pim! My niece is missing. I'm hiring the hunters!"
"115740052-0-50416";"Of course you are. Take this portal curio for a quick return exit when you're done. Now, into the circle. And focus."
"115740052-0-50417";"Now we know why Nantharion needed a living fortress! Let's find that throne room!"
"115740052-0-50418";"We're above the gate, but no sign of Beragon. What's he up to?"
"115740052-0-50419";"I have my own theories as to why such ancient blood would be fresh. Alas. the Recollection had no interest in my musings."
"115740052-0-50420";"Here we are, the Sacred Water. Drawn from a spring in the very heart of an Ayleid sanctuary, I don't doubt."
"115740052-0-50421";"The contents of this bottle … they've been partially used? Have they been drinking on the job?"
"115740052-0-50422";"Sacred water, a blood vial, and a bottle of wine. Yes, that should be all of them. Let's head back to the altar and see what we can do."
"115740052-0-50423";"There's our altar. Note the three bowls. We need to put all three items on the altar, then anoint it with the proper liquid. Come, let's make haste in finding all of them."
"115740052-0-50426";"Over there. What's on that stone table?"
"115740052-0-50427";"That didn't work! Assistant, try another offering!"
"115740052-0-50428";"That did it. Ahem…just as I predicted! A tribute to the wine shared between the Retainers upon their arrival. Good job following my instructions, assistant. I'll make an explorer of you yet!"
"115740052-0-50429";"You certainly took your time! The path is now clear, and the Emblem of the Last King calls to me! Come!"
"115740052-0-50430";"No, not that way! Please, concentrate!"
"115740052-0-50431";"This place just keeps going up! How big is this tree, anyway?"
"115740052-0-50432";"These ruins used to be on the hillside below. Hoperoot's branches raised them into the sky!"
"115740052-0-50433";"That shawl on the table … there's something strange about it."
"115740052-0-50434";"Keep your gold, Octavius. My friend and I are going to fix this!"
"115740052-0-50435";"Do what you have to. But don't blame me, Pim."
"115740052-0-50436";"Come now, little fawn. You cannot run forever."
"115740052-0-50437";"No quarry can escape me. Hounds, after it!"
"115740052-0-50438";"Hyacinth gave me one of his portal curios. One moment and …."
"115740052-0-50443";"Just as I said, my power overwhelms the fawn."
"115740052-0-50444";"A ward of that power now binds it. Dispel the ward."
"115740052-0-50445";"I will see both of you in my domain, then. I will grant my promised power to the one that sought it. And offer safe harbor to the one that did not."
"115740052-0-50454";"Spare me your pleasantries, Gardener. I must have a word with my rescuers."
"115740052-0-50456";"Heh. She's as spirited as ever. Go introduce yourself to her, my friend."
"115740052-0-50457";"Not yet, but I have copious notes. Gardener, I'll speak to you now."
"115740052-0-50458";"A traitor! In the Garland Ring? How is that possible?"
"115740052-0-50459";"I scouted around, and the Goblins look agitated here, too. Let's see what we can find."
"115740052-0-50461";"Try not to call too much attention to yourself. I don't want to stress the Goblins more than necessary."
"115740052-0-50463";"Gather the relics, proxy. We shall have need of them."
"115740052-0-50464";"If you would place all three items that we collected onto the altar, we can proceed."
"115740052-0-50466";"Tan? Can I talk to you and your friend?"
"115740052-0-50467";"Wisteria! Are you all right? How are your wounds healing? Do you need anything?"
"115740052-0-50472";"Oh no, their shaman? Look at the wounds. Goblin weapons don't cause trauma like that."
"115740052-0-50473";"The missing totem and the shaman. It's all so horrid, but we should talk over what we found."
"115740052-0-50474";"Normally there's an incredible totem in this shrine. Where is it? Goblins never move their totems!"
"115740052-0-50475";"A rusty knife? It's not one of the Goblin's. See the handle? Much too big for them."
"115740052-0-50476";"Ah, proxy. Just in time. Use the Echonir and see if some lingering memory can lead us to the shrine."
"115740052-0-50477";"The priests allowed their Princes to possess them and waded into the water? Ah! I know where to find the shrine."
"115740052-0-50478";"Narsis Dren is no stranger to a puzzle, but can his assistant exhibit the same prowess? Let's wait and see! Go on now, read that epitaph."
"115740052-0-50479";"Hey! Over by the gate!"
"115740052-0-50480";"Snapdragon! Am I glad to see you! Alive and everything even!"
"115740052-0-50481";"Another Ithelia? So powerful and proud. Collect the ingredient and let us go back, mortal."
"115740052-0-50482";"No, Torvesard. They are … different. Approach, pathwalker, and speak with me."
"115740052-0-50483";"Here. I offer you a path home. Take it with my blessing."
"115740052-0-50484";"My work? Oh, adventurer. I think I know what he's doing."
"115740052-0-50485";"Sorry, Goblin researcher. Looks like I won."
"115740052-0-50487";"Ask your precious researcher. Her work's very enlightening."
"115740052-0-50488";"Finding the knife we planted won't change anything, Pim."
"115740052-0-50489";"You stole the knife? Why?"
"115740052-0-50492";"I'll meet you on the west side of Gray's Hollow when you have the totems. Good luck!"
"115740052-0-50495";"Snapdragon! We found her!"
"115740052-0-50498";"Bogcup, thank the gods!"
"115740052-0-50500";"Hello, friend. It looks like the Recollection is camped right on top of Niryastare. We need a plan."
"115740052-0-50501";"I think we've seen enough. Let's compare notes."
"115740052-0-50503";"This can't be a coincidence."
"115740052-0-50504";"Look up there! The same sad banner again. This must be the Ceythalmor prison!"
"115740052-0-50505";"There! Now let's get out of here before more guards show up!"
"115740052-0-50506";"Dread fills this path. Find the ingredient, but use caution. We are not welcome here."
"115740052-0-50507";"Unbridled anger fills these halls. We have entered a war zone. Find the last ingredient, but be careful."
"115740052-0-50508";"This reflection seems resigned to her fate. Quite different from the other. Let us get the ingredient and go."
"115740052-0-50509";"I saw how to open a doorway. Let us return to the inn's cellar."
"115740052-0-50510";"This shrine appears old, decayed. What happened here?"
"115740052-0-50511";"Have Mora's forces finally come? Then, I am finished."
"115740052-0-50512";"This Ithelia chose uncontrolled rage. It will consume every piece of this reality."
"115740052-0-50513";"We must leave this path before my reflection destroys it."
"115740052-0-50514";"Hermeaus Mora consumes this shrine. His response to the savagery of Ithelia's defense."
"115740052-0-50515";"You have to get the totems back. Nothing else will stop this violence."
"115740052-0-50516";"Over here!"
"115740052-0-50517";"Here they come. Don't attack them."
"115740052-0-50518";"I did not take your totems, but I am returning them. So, please stop."
"115740052-0-50520";"Ah, the Emblem at last! I've bested those Recollection fools!"
"115740052-0-50524";"Give it your all! I'll be here for the point at which you undoubtedly will need my consult."
"115740052-0-50527";"Hyacinth went with the Thalmor, through that door."
"115740052-0-50528";"That burn Snapdragon gave you, it must be very painful. I've seen wounds like that before. If you don't get healed soon …."
"115740052-0-50531";"Sage's Dream, do you have it?"
"115740052-0-50538";"We'll see if this Recollection fanatic's tongue loosens up when the Legion reinforcements arrive. Varen's Watch will be ours again in no time!"
"115740052-0-50540";"Look at all this mess! Ugh, the Recollection has no regard for proper excavation procedures. Elfbetta, my usual assistant, would be shocked by such disarray."
"115740052-0-50543";"You hold your own against me, now face a multitude!"
"115740052-0-50544";"I never sought this battle, but you leave me no choice."
"115740052-0-50546";"I will restore the glory of Mirrormoor!"
"115740052-0-50549";"I will restore what was lost, mortal! I must!"
"115740052-0-50551";"Enough! Witness the combined power of the Fate-Changer and the Master of Fate!"
"115740052-0-50552";"Use the portal to help Beragon!"
"115740052-0-50553";"Did you know that Wendir means journey in Ayleid? It could mean a journey into the afterlife, or some other destination for the ancient elves. It's amazing what you can learn from me, eh?"
"115740052-0-50554";"Use the portal to help Scruut!"
"115740052-0-50556";"Enter the portal, proxy!"
"115740052-0-50557";"Isn't this nice, assistant? You get to walk through a ruin like this with none other than myself, Narsis Dren, as your guide."
"115740052-0-50558";"Assistant, have I ever regaled you with my research on ancestral tombs in Vvardenfell? It would only take a few hours."
"115740052-0-50559";"Allow me to enlighten you, assistant. Keep an eye out for Daedric symbology. The Ayleids worshiped the Daedra, and were destroyed by Daedra-haters. You can take notes if you need to."
"115740052-0-50560";"This is it. After you, proxy."
"115740052-0-50563";"You try my patience, mortal!"
"115740052-0-50564";"You agitate me to no end, mortal!"
"115740052-0-50566";"The screaming stopped. Do you think Haldain's all right?"
"115740052-0-50567";"Haldain bought us time. Let me work and we can make sure his sacrifice was worth it."
"115740052-0-50579";"Seems everyone left in a hurry. Take a look around."
"115740052-0-50580";"This could have been me, mere moments ago. Thank the gods for my quick reflexes."
"115740052-0-50581";"Oh, hello. Another of our Recollection friends, eh? He stepped on that grate too, I see, with more permanent results. A shame he isn't as skillful and dexterous as I."
"115740052-0-50582";"Ack! What is this? Assistant! Don't you have anything to say about getting me caught up in this noxious mist? You were the one to trip the trap!"
"115740052-0-50583";"Smell that? Sea salt and blood. Be ready."
"115740052-0-50584";"Best be on our way. Keep an eye out for these grates, if you would, assistant."
"115740052-0-50585";"Three of the Loyal Retainers! Stand back, assistant! I'll speak their names and command them!"
"115740052-0-50588";"Wisteria! Stop!"
"115740052-0-50589";"Tanlorin … the levers."
"115740052-0-50590";"Pull the control levers, friend!"
"115740052-0-50592";"That did it! Hyacinth, are you all right?"
"115740052-0-50593";"Thank you, both. I would not have lasted much longer. We should speak outside."
"115740052-0-50594";"Oh, Wisteria. You showed so much promise."
"115740052-0-50597";"They need a way to read the Initiative and other Garland Ring documents. They know I have the remaining key."
"115740052-0-50598";"Wisteria has gone to your greenhouse? Good. She and I need to have a word."
"115740052-0-50601";"Careful, Bogcup. Wisteria is not who we thought she was."
"115740052-0-50602";"Get to the Gardener, Hyacinth. We can handle Wisteria."
"115740052-0-50605";"There's so much blood."
"115740052-0-50606";"A trap door. That must lead down into the tunnels."
"115740052-0-50609";"Wisteria! Why are you doing this? Help me understand."
"115740052-0-50610";"I'm doing this for us, Tan. Remember our dream? A world free from suffering, from corruption. Safe."
"115740052-0-50612";"A world controlled by the Ceythalmor? How is that safe?"
"115740052-0-50613";"The Ceythalmor are a means to an end. It would be a world under our control. Please. Listen to me."
"115740052-0-50616";"She makes it look so easy, walking out of my life."
"115740052-0-50620";"Hello? Is someone there? I need help."
"115740052-0-50621";"Bella? What is Octavius' niece doing here?"
"115740052-0-50630";"We don't even know whose blood we're following."
"115740052-0-50631";"I'm trusting you to deal out justice for the dead Goblins."
"115740052-0-50632";"Thank you. Did I hear you mention a knife? Can I see it?"
"115740052-0-50633";"I'll meet you at Gray's Hollow!"
"115740052-0-50634";"You'll never take me alive!"
"115740052-0-50635";"I won't let you destroy my life's work!"
"115740052-0-50636";"Oh gods, not here too! The totem is gone and the shaman is dead."
"115740052-0-50637";"The Fable of the Dragon? This one's going to be a puzzler my friend."
"115740052-0-50638";"See what I mean? I think King Nantharion could be at one of those marked locations."
"115740052-0-50639";"A moment, assistant."
"115740052-0-50640";"And now, anoint the altar with the sacred water! With this, our way is opened!"
"115740052-0-50642";"Balandrus must be keeping the bloodfiends in dens. Just follow the sound of their wails and we'll use the remaining explosives."
"115740052-0-50643";"Excellent … wait, nothing is happening. Is it broken? Do I have a broken altar? Surely the sacred water must be the solution, I'm sure of it."
"115740052-0-50644";"All right, now we can get to the real business."
"115740052-0-50666";"If you are seeing this, the Crow has set you on the path to learn the art of Scribing. A world of magic awaits you."
"115740052-0-50667";"I've left behind another sort of guide: the True-Sight Lens. Seek it out in the east wing."
"115740052-0-50668";"The lens and the fables are signposts to seek the Luminaries. And they will teach you far more than I ever could."
"115740052-0-50669";"You'll pay for that!"
"115740052-0-50670";"Let's make this quick!"
"115740052-0-50674";"Hmm. It seems Mizzik has been fooled by a four-legged escape artist."
"115740052-0-50676";"Ah, greetings traveler! Perhaps you can help Mizzik in his search?"
"115740052-0-50677";"What's that? Mizzik hears voices. Let us listen in."
"115740052-0-50678";"Get it together, Edric. You're a mess."
"115740052-0-50679";"Our dear lady is dead and you still don't believe me."
"115740052-0-50680";"Then talk to the investigator. Don't pull me into this."
"115740052-0-50681";"Can we even trust him? I don't want to be labeled a suspect."
"115740052-0-50682";"Better to talk to an investigator than a gardener, Edric."
"115740052-0-50683";"Not a gardener, a friend. You'd do well to leave, Otho. And take Betu with you."
"115740052-0-50684";"Be mindful of where you point fingers, Edric."
"115740052-0-50685";"The lens shows you magic the way Ulfsild saw it, shades of how the Luminaries see it. Now, find the wards!"
"115740052-0-50686";"Oh gods! Did Haldain make it out?"
"115740052-0-50687";"Quiet! We can worry about that later. If he's dead, I don't want to join him."
"115740052-0-50688";"Find two more wards to reveal the fragment."
"115740052-0-50689";"The wards are gone, and the fragment revealed!"
"115740052-0-50691";"We need to talk, comrade."
"115740052-0-50692";"She opened a portal! I'm leaping down!"
"115740052-0-50693";"I'll tackle her in. Follow us!"
"115740052-0-50701";"I don't know what you're playing at, but you were a fool to come here."
"115740052-0-50702";"Fine. Then you can help deal with your cousin and that inane investigator."
"115740052-0-50703";"Now where could that mangy dog have gotten off to?"
"115740052-0-50704";"There's Lady Pelena and her husband Uriel, our once long-lost son."
"115740052-0-50705";"Oh, Mizzik! I didn't see you there. I believe I saw Betu heading south."
"115740052-0-50706";"Commander, I see two legionaries trapped outside the barricade."
"115740052-0-50709";"Torvesard opened the prison!"
"115740052-0-50710";"I have heard whispers of paths such as this. They can be found throughout Apocrypha. Press on, proxy."
"115740052-0-50711";"That's all of them. Let's look around."
"115740052-0-50712";"Let's see how many cuts you can survive."
"115740052-0-50713";"I wanted to kill the Black-Glove. But you'll do."
"115740052-0-50714";"The Forgemaster will follow you to the grave."
"115740052-0-50715";"I never lose."
"115740052-0-50716";"I'm better than you."
"115740052-0-50717";"Aradros … I failed you."
"115740052-0-50718";"Donolon's apprentice is no true baker!"
"115740052-0-50719";"This will ruin Chef Donolon for sure!"
"115740052-0-50720";"Father trusted me and I failed him …."
"115740052-0-50721";"How foolish of you to think that I would just disappear."
"115740052-0-50722";"So this is the memorial Lady Weatherleah built for her son."
"115740052-0-50723";"Edric's tankard. There seems to be a suspicious residue inside."
"115740052-0-50724";"So that's it, Corvus? People are dying, and you turn a blind eye because you're busy?"
"115740052-0-50725";"I wouldn't expect a deserter and a thief to understand the Legion's duties. Look after yourself, Hooke. You always have."
"115740052-0-50726";"Plans for Alinor? That doesn't sound good."
"115740052-0-50728";"Stendarr, give me the patience to wait out this misguided scoundrel."
"115740052-0-50734";"Lor-Emero! Parhaelia! Ballepelin! Yondvarla! And um … hang on, I don't know that last name. No, no, wait—"
"115740052-0-50736";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-50737";"What's a jumped-up alligator got to do to get a drink around here?"
"115740052-0-50738";"There we are! Now to return to the altar. I'll go ahead and dust myself off a bit from the battle. Take the wine on your way out. We'll be needing that."
"115740052-0-50739";"A Skein of Secrets, used to defeat Ithelia long ago? I cannot help but wonder what became of it. Come, proxy. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-50740";"That was a dark day. Old Ri'jhaad sees now what he must tell you."
"115740052-0-50742";"Nice targeting, mercenary! Get ready for the next wave."
"115740052-0-50743";"Keep it up, I see another wave approaching."
"115740052-0-50744";"That's it for the ballista. Tribune, look sharp!"
"115740052-0-50745";"Daedra emerging through the north door! With me, comrade!"
"115740052-0-50746";"Comrade, you're with me."
"115740052-0-50747";"Ah. I just sent your friends to the library. It's down the stairs to your right."
"115740052-0-50748";"Look! The Echonir has something to show us. Fate has led us true again."
"115740052-0-50749";"How did Daedra get down here? Let's talk."
"115740052-0-50750";"Oh, my love, how I miss you."
"115740052-0-50751";"You were taken much too soon."
"115740052-0-50756";"Noraine needs to learn to hunt. You know it's time, Regomor."
"115740052-0-50757";"She will. But not from you."
"115740052-0-50758";"Kynareth bless me, I like these odds."
"115740052-0-50759";"After I win this, I can afford a new mount."
"115740052-0-50760";"I'll win it all back and then some."
"115740052-0-50761";"I lost? Give me one more chance!"
"115740052-0-50762";"I'll win next time, I'm sure."
"115740052-0-50763";"Just go home, Zedrich."
"115740052-0-50764";"Careful, Zedrich. You still owe from last game."
"115740052-0-50765";"Who's that stranger?"
"115740052-0-50767";"Ah! Oh, it's only you."
"115740052-0-50768";"Ah! There you are! I was beginning to get worried."
"115740052-0-50769";"Come here, little friend. I won't hurt you!"
"115740052-0-50770";"We'll have so much fun together! I just have to catch you first."
"115740052-0-50771";"I'll get you something tasty. What do prairie dogs eat again? Meat?"
"115740052-0-50772";"Y'ffre's beard! How does Hinulbor make it look so easy?"
"115740052-0-50775";"I know. The law won't forget our mistakes, but this time, we do the right thing. We can catch this coward. Together."
"115740052-0-50778";"I won't be defeated so easily!"
"115740052-0-50779";"The door is behind that gap in the rocks."
"115740052-0-50780";"Stay alert while we look for Commander Merian."
"115740052-0-50781";"Commander, they're climbing over the walls! We can't—"
"115740052-0-50782";"He's up on the wall. How can we help, commander?"
"115740052-0-50783";"Blasted clever Daedra! Meet me in the courtyard!"
"115740052-0-50784";"For the shardmarshal! For Mirrormoor!"
"115740052-0-50785";"That's all the ropes I can see. Good work."
"115740052-0-50786";"That's all of the traps. I hope they hurt."
"115740052-0-50787";"Let the legionaries handle the Daedra. We need to reach the commander."
"115740052-0-50788";"The courtyard is through those doors."
"115740052-0-50789";"How are the barracks crawling with Daedra?"
"115740052-0-50790";"Ballista storage. See that lift? It brings them up into the courtyard."
"115740052-0-50791";"We're near the armory. Let's hope they haven't found it."
"115740052-0-50792";"The armory's just through those doors. Be ready for anything."
"115740052-0-50793";"Stop buying things, sister!"
"115740052-0-50794";"She meant for us to buy a home! Not lavish meals!"
"115740052-0-50795";"You're impossible! Though a hot meal might be nice."
"115740052-0-50796";"Mother gave us coin. We should use it!"
"115740052-0-50797";"Fine! But we need to eat."
"115740052-0-50798";"Please, Marcan! Naku did not know you were there! None of us did!"
"115740052-0-50799";"That is no excuse. I almost envy you, Scarlet. Today you have a chance to pay for all your mistakes."
"115740052-0-50800";"You over there! The helper. The Scarlets don't deserve your protection. Leave them to their fate. This is my final warning."
"115740052-0-50801";"Enough! You cannot stop me!"
"115740052-0-50802";"Rise, minions, and break this fool's bones!"
"115740052-0-50803";"These notes … it's like the killer knew how to get under each Scarlet's skin. They've been watching us."
"115740052-0-50804";"I do not recognize these Dremora. Perhaps Torvesard is not the only one beginning to remember the Forgotten Prince."
"115740052-0-50805";"Wildburn seed? Not sure what that could be, but the handwriting at the bottom, that's Sorilen's."
"115740052-0-50806";"Be angry all you want, dear wife, but don't cause a scene. I'm here to stay."
"115740052-0-50807";"I'm here, friend. If you're ready, let's head inside."
"115740052-0-50808";"The Heartland Elves never did anything halfway, did they?"
"115740052-0-50809";"The wildlife down here might see us as a threat."
"115740052-0-50810";"Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for the auction."
"115740052-0-50811";"Traveler! Be careful, bugs aplenty here."
"115740052-0-50812";"They're drawn to remnants of the ritual, and they're likely to be territorial."
"115740052-0-50813";"That's it, traveler! An Ayleid mosaic that represents me perfectly!"
"115740052-0-50814";"Got it. Let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-50815";"Of course, the scene of Lady Weatherleah's fall. Let us investigate the library."
"115740052-0-50816";"The library is to the left. Your other left."
"115740052-0-50820";"The library exterior is just around the corner."
"115740052-0-50821";"Betu? What is he sniffing?"
"115740052-0-50823";"There's been another murder? The killer could come for any one of us next!"
"115740052-0-50824";"Nonsense. It's clear Edric was a troubled man who killed Lady Weatherleah and took his own life."
"115740052-0-50825";"Maybe so, but I'm not leaving this room just yet."
"115740052-0-50826";"This scrap of fabric seems to have been torn from an expensive dress."
"115740052-0-50828";"Hang on, I sense something. Let's check out that pavilion."
"115740052-0-50829";"Good boy, Betu! Our killer may very well have fled through this door."
"115740052-0-50830";"Vashabar! Laeni and Clendagal have returned. Let them be heard."
"115740052-0-50831";"These tunnels seem to run under the entire property! Good thing we have Betu's nose to lead us."
"115740052-0-50832";"I hear Pelena's voice! She must be nearby."
"115740052-0-50833";"Get away from me you beasts!"
"115740052-0-50834";"Vashabar, we need your help. Laeni and I want to marry."
"115740052-0-50835";"As you all know, our fathers refuse to support us. And so we invoke the Rite of Propagation, an ancient Bosmer custom."
"115740052-0-50839";"We gathered these symbols, representations of our roles in the village. An Ayleid mosaic for me."
"115740052-0-50840";"Our future lies in whatever you decide. Do we have your support?"
"115740052-0-50841";"I wonder what these ruins were? They're certainly older than the structures above."
"115740052-0-50842";"Pelena, why would you hurt Betu?"
"115740052-0-50843";"Because this whole family can rot for all I care!"
"115740052-0-50844";"Otho, escort Pelena back to the manor. We will follow the dog!"
"115740052-0-50845";"It seems Betu has brought us something."
"115740052-0-50846";"What have you got there, boy?"
"115740052-0-50847";"Lady Weatherleah must have left that note before her death. We should show it to Aquilia."
"115740052-0-50848";"We must study the scene carefully. Look for anything out of place."
"115740052-0-50849";"A Daedric invasion in Firsthold! I still can't believe it. I hope Snapdragon didn't run into any trouble."
"115740052-0-50850";"Clear the rubble!"
"115740052-0-50851";"This is the place. Let's go inside and find Snapdragon."
"115740052-0-50852";"That smell, like burnt paper! And where's Snapdragon?"
"115740052-0-50853";"They didn't burn this. We might still have something! Here, let me see."
"115740052-0-50854";"Auri-El's bow! This is bad."
"115740052-0-50855";"He's got Tham! Let's finish the bastard!"
"115740052-0-50857";"On the path to ally with the Dragon you must choose your words carefully."
"115740052-0-50858";"If she asks if you are my inheritor, do not agree or disagree. Insist upon taking her trial."
"115740052-0-50859";"Then seek my annotated fable at the meeting of many paths. A room full of doors with no hinges."
"115740052-0-50860";"That's Fort Dirich, an old watchtower to the northwest of Skingrad. I'll meet you there, friend."
"115740052-0-50861";"Run! This tree-fort's coming down around us!"
"115740052-0-50862";"No glyphics, no repressed memories. Just you and I as the last witnesses to the existence of the Prince of Paths. We were bound by this threat to reality. Now we share this final secret. Farewell, mortal."
"115740052-0-50863";"Mercenary, I bring word from Tribune Alea!"
"115740052-0-50869";"Another student perhaps?"
"115740052-0-50870";"Go, my Prince! You must escape!"
"115740052-0-50872";"Ah, a visitor on a mission! Like a ringtail after a beetle."
"115740052-0-50874";"Ah, the outsider. How goes your quest?"
"115740052-0-50879";"Here he is. My former partner. Rise, Zerith-var! I finally found you a partner you might actually be able to work with. Meet Ravith."
"115740052-0-50880";"Moon-Singer Talbira. You bring me another one? I told you, no more pretty voices that turn tail as soon as we set foot in the darkness."
"115740052-0-50881";"Ahh, I see. The cat who walks only at night thinks everyone else fears the dark."
"115740052-0-50882";"I see why you wish to pass him to another, Talbira. Do they keep him here because it is the only place in the temple large enough for his big head?"
"115740052-0-50883";"Ha! I knew you would make a perfect match. If you do not kill each other, you will be tamiiti in no time."
"115740052-0-50884";"We will see about that. Let us hear this song of yours, then, Ravith."
"115740052-0-50886";"Our initial investigations are complete, proxy. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-50893";"Tanlorin? I knew you'd find me. But you're too late."
"115740052-0-50894";"Just stand back, spitfire. Let me change the world. For us."
"115740052-0-50895";"This isn't what I want, Wisteria. If you go after the Proxy Queen, I'm coming after you."
"115740052-0-50896";"There's that spark! Do what you must, Tan."
"115740052-0-50897";"We're ready. On your order."
"115740052-0-50898";"Go! If you oppose me, Tan, I won't hold back."
"115740052-0-50899";"Just use the ritual foci to get the magic flowing again."
"115740052-0-50906";"No more practice today, Ravith. Let us rest."
"115740052-0-50907";"Not yet. One more try!"
"115740052-0-50908";"My song will work, th'murr. Raise the construct."
"115740052-0-50909";"No turning back, friend. Let's go cause some trouble."
"115740052-0-50910";"Let my word go forth. Purge Ithelia from every mind in our shared reality, now and for eternity."
"115740052-0-50912";"Wisteria! It's over. Give this up. Please."
"115740052-0-50915";"I'll meet you back in Vashabar. To perform the rite, and face my father."
"115740052-0-50916";"See you back in Vashabar. We've faced the bugs, now to face my father."
"115740052-0-50917";"What a terrible occurrence. How shall we explain this to the court?"
"115740052-0-50918";"Your majesty. Hello. I'm an admirer. Heh heh. Sorry about the mess."
"115740052-0-50920";"I see I'm just in time. Bogcup, well done. Hello, my dear niece. Don't I always say that your uncle has your best interests at heart?"
"115740052-0-50921";"Uncle? We should have known you had a hand in this."
"115740052-0-50922";"I'll answer all your questions, I promise. But first I must tend to my associates."
"115740052-0-50923";"We shall allow it. But we insist you return as soon as possible."
"115740052-0-50924";"Of course. Bogcup, would you and your friend care to accompany me back to the greenhouse?"
"115740052-0-50925";"I suggest you speak to whoever you wish before entering the portal. Just in the unlikely event that you never return."
"115740052-0-50934";"Ahh, at last."
"115740052-0-50935";"Ursilia, before we talk, let me see if I've got anything that will flush the wine from your system."
"115740052-0-50936";"I'm not drunk, Fennorian! I only had a glass or two."
"115740052-0-50937";"Ursilia, about your husband …."
"115740052-0-50938";"Not now, Fennorian. I have more important matters."
"115740052-0-50939";"As I was saying, I'll compensate double wages for all who remain. With your expertise, we'll revive the traditional methods and be producing excellent wine in no time!"
"115740052-0-50940";"A dead Inquisitor. I shall invite forth his spirit. Perhaps he will be more amenable in death than in life."
"115740052-0-50942";"Ravith is … too powerful. My song … weakens. Zerith, you must act now!"
"115740052-0-50943";"Our hearts beat as one, Zerith. What will it do to you if you turn your blade upon me?"
"115740052-0-50945";"Most extraordinary! Bogcup and their friend stopped Wisteria and saved the Proxy Queen."
"115740052-0-50946";"After everything we've been through, can we stop with the flower names. Why am I a Bogcup, anyway?"
"115740052-0-50947";"Oh, Bog—Tanlorin. The name was never meant as an insult. The bogcup blossom flourishes in the harshest of environments. Just like you."
"115740052-0-50948";"Oh, that's … that's sweet, actually. Thank you."
"115740052-0-50949";"You don't have to tell me twice. Let's go."
"115740052-0-50950";"I've asked our friend to burn this bouquet. A reminder of all we've lost. A farewell to who we were."
"115740052-0-50951";"I began the Garland Ring with a hope to change the Dominion for the better. I believe we did, though it tested us greatly."
"115740052-0-50952";"The Garland Ring is no more. But perhaps something new shall grow from the ashes. To a brighter future, for all of us, one and all."
"115740052-0-50953";"Away, beasts! Oh, you there, help me! They're after my bait, but don't hurt them!"
"115740052-0-50954";"Excellent, now throw it! Quickly, as hard as you can!"
"115740052-0-50955";"Oh, thank the Divines, they're leaving. Please, can you help me out of this mess?"
"115740052-0-50956";"Thank you, stranger. That's the last time I try baiting a snare after it's set. Ugh, guzzards are awful."
"115740052-0-50957";"We will guard the seed with our lives, my king."
"115740052-0-50959";"Oil from Alinor? Perfect. Mix it at the alchemy table!"
"115740052-0-50960";"Well, that takes care of two more seeds. Let's talk outside."
"115740052-0-50961";"I don't believe it! According to the Skein, Nantharion's back in Vashabar!"
"115740052-0-50962";"That poor beast has been corrupted by wildburn, but what's it doing here?"
"115740052-0-50963";"I think someone's been down here. Let's see if we can find a wildburn seed."
"115740052-0-50964";"This place is crawling with Recollection and fallen legionaries. I hope Tribune Alea is all right."
"115740052-0-50965";"More Shardborn and Recollection ahead."
"115740052-0-50966";"Why are they just waiting around? What are they guarding?"
"115740052-0-50967";"These halls go on forever. We need to keep searching."
"115740052-0-50968";"Even if your allies tell you the answers, you'll still need to complete the tasks yourself."
"115740052-0-50969";"Your wisdom and wit have proven your worth. Accept the power of the Dragon, mortal. And may you prove clever enough in its use."
"115740052-0-50970";"Comrade! You need to find a way to close that portal!"
"115740052-0-50971";"There you are! You just … vanished."
"115740052-0-50972";"Hmm. I see you've found whatever this is. It's not the Fable of the Netch, as I recall it."
"115740052-0-50973";"Nevertheless an entertaining read. I quite enjoyed the Netch bosom."
"115740052-0-50974";"That memory showed Shardborn fighting other Daedra. Ithelia was defending something in this place."
"115740052-0-50975";"Another memory? We might learn something. Go ahead. I'll watch for Vargas."
"115740052-0-50976";"Is this where Ithelia lost her ancient battle? Hmm. Her minions remained to guard the passage behind her."
"115740052-0-50977";"Beragon! He's somewhere beyond that gate. Use Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-50978";"Hello? Anyone? Tribune Alea, where are you?"
"115740052-0-50979";"Bright moons! There you are. Over here!"
"115740052-0-50980";"We came as quickly as we could, ja'rithantii."
"115740052-0-50981";"I am the Terror of the Weald! You never should have left us, Maerenah!"
"115740052-0-50982";"The terror ends here, Balandrus!"
"115740052-0-50983";"(Loud chattering)"
"115740052-0-50984";"What in Y'ffre's name? Is that a squirrel?"
"115740052-0-50985";"I think it worked!"
"115740052-0-50986";"Quick, follow them!"
"115740052-0-50987";"Go deal with the remaining relics. I'll see you again at my townhouse in Skingrad."
"115740052-0-50989";"Hm, where is it now…. Aha! Assistant, this is where they had been keeping some items that they uncovered in the excavation."
"115740052-0-50990";"Friends, the gate closed behind me. Hurry, use Abolisher. Nantharion is just ahead!"
"115740052-0-50991";"Such a relief. And I'll be able to press and sort out your clothing in time for any balls or soirees."
"115740052-0-50992";"Beragon, wait for us, damn it!"
"115740052-0-50993";"Nantharion! Stop! A wildburn unleashed with the power from that well will destroy West Weald!"
"115740052-0-50994";"Ahh, you found it! The true fable. Not as good as my version, of course."
"115740052-0-50995";"Sariyaah! I'm so sorry for disappearing, I know how you worry. Can you forgive me?"
"115740052-0-50996";"Marcien, my friend, there's nothing to forgive. I'm the one who should be sorry for sending you out on such a dangerous job."
"115740052-0-50997";"It's fine, especially thanks to our friend here. I'm glad your pets arrived safe and sound. Although, um, shouldn't they be inside the cages?"
"115740052-0-50998";"Your foes destroyed your seeds, but do not fear. My very presence has awakened the well."
"115740052-0-50999";"Then draw power from the well, my Prince. You will be restored and I will create a wildburn that transforms the Weald!"
"115740052-0-51000";"Down there! Ithelia and her servants. They reached the well!"
"115740052-0-51001";"Let us see what Mora took from me."
"115740052-0-51002";"Ugh, not again! Shoo! Go ahead, traveler. I'll be fine, I promise!"
"115740052-0-51003";"I'm sorry, is that … a riddle?"
"115740052-0-51004";"This must be some sort of joke!"
"115740052-0-51005";"Feel free to speak with the others, but join me in the study when you are ready."
"115740052-0-51006";"It's settled, then? You should sort out the rest of this. I'll make my own way to Skingrad."
"115740052-0-51007";"Welcome to my little grotto! Drink it in, you've found the Netch. I hope I live up to expectations."
"115740052-0-51008";"Knight, you have an aptitude for magic. Perhaps you just have not found the right teacher …."
"115740052-0-51009";"You sound like my mother. I know enough magic to get by. It's just not my focus."
"115740052-0-51010";"Father, I got here as soon as I could. Please. Can you hear me?"
"115740052-0-51011";"I'm sorry, my love. He's very weak."
"115740052-0-51012";"Elic, Melvina, hello. It must be a surprise to see me."
"115740052-0-51013";"Nahlia? What are you doing here?"
"115740052-0-51014";"I'll fill you in shortly. We're here to help. Friend, can I have a word?"
"115740052-0-51015";"Nahlia, please. Is there anything you and your friend can do?"
"115740052-0-51016";"I just want him to know I'm here."
"115740052-0-51017";"One moment, Elic. This ink is … it's working. You're headed to Dragon Bridge. Walk with Magnus."
"115740052-0-51018";"Every mercenary in Dark Company fights to their last breath!"
"115740052-0-51019";"Father! It's Elic. I'm here. Just be still."
"115740052-0-51020";"My boy. I've much to say after coming so far. Just let me catch my breath."
"115740052-0-51021";"Elic, my life's pride, I'm so sorry. Those things I said to you—I wish I could take it all back."
"115740052-0-51022";"I know, Dad. I'm sorry I didn't give you the chance to make amends."
"115740052-0-51023";"Shh, my boy. We're together now. That's all that matters."
"115740052-0-51025";"Like them!"
"115740052-0-51026";"Scruut, where is this instability you detected?"
"115740052-0-51027";"Good question. But the threads of fate connected to that mortal are shredded. We should talk to him."
"115740052-0-51028";"Are they gone? The sounds of combat stopped."
"115740052-0-51029";"That barrier is cutting off a section I wanted to search for the knot."
"115740052-0-51030";"No matter, we can still search the sunken ruins. This way."
"115740052-0-51031";"We must enter the cave and see this tear for ourselves."
"115740052-0-51032";"Meet us at Beragon's townhouse when you have restored the relics. And, if you would, convey my regards to Gadayn."
"115740052-0-51033";"How exactly do we prepare ourselves for Oblivion?"
"115740052-0-51034";"A good point. There is no telling what we may encounter. Still, that is our course."
"115740052-0-51036";"You have such a remarkable way of setting books down. Very deliberate!"
"115740052-0-51037";"Reward the mortal if it pleases you, my Prince, but greater victory awaits us in Mirrormoor."
"115740052-0-51038";"My first mission. My first brush with death. The Reachfolk had us on the run. I was so far from home and certain I'd die alone."
"115740052-0-51039";"Borderwatch. The day I thought Elic would join me as a soldier in my new assignment. The day he would break my heart."
"115740052-0-51040";"My final mission. My wife, long gone. My son, estranged and beyond my reach. I was alone. A soldier's worst nightmare."
"115740052-0-51042";"Keshargo has searched but not found the arcane knot."
"115740052-0-51043";"Souls? Ghost lights? Whatever they are, you set them free."
"115740052-0-51044";"Perhaps the ghost lights are the way out of this room. Go look."
"115740052-0-51045";"I assume you still need to restore the other relics? I'll see you back at Beragon's townhouse."
"115740052-0-51046";"Lower your weapons, I only want to talk."
"115740052-0-51047";"Consider what I have said. We Daedra may be immutable, but you mortals are not."
"115740052-0-51048";"I knew there was something wrong about you."
"115740052-0-51049";"Must I do everything myself?"
"115740052-0-51051";"Gadayn? I—I did not expect you so soon."
"115740052-0-51052";"I came as quickly as Scruut's trinket allowed. I want to help, however I can. Let me accompany you."
"115740052-0-51053";"I … of course. Let us make haste, proxy."
"115740052-0-51054";"You're too late, pest! Prepare for the inevitable!"
"115740052-0-51055";"Xoryn, do not unleash that creature!"
"115740052-0-51056";"I'm glad you're back, Leramil. Maybe you can help us understand what happened to Ithelia in Miscarcand."
"115740052-0-51057";"Fate has demanded I assist its proxy. It is why I am here."
"115740052-0-51058";"I remember and answer Torvesard's call!"
"115740052-0-51059";"Prince Ithelia's scion requires Clan Shardborn's power!"
"115740052-0-51060";"Forward, Clan Shardborn! Show them our fury!"
"115740052-0-51061";"A thousand deaths for every memory stolen from us!"
"115740052-0-51062";"It seems Lady Weatherleah led her own investigation into her son's death."
"115740052-0-51063";"Sorry about that one, adventurer. I need to brief you."
"115740052-0-51064";"Seems we have a pest problem of sorts."
"115740052-0-51065";"I'll help Julian and Irnard set up wards, this won't happen again on my watch."
"115740052-0-51066";"What is with all the questions, cousin? Aren't you happy to see me?"
"115740052-0-51067";"There's our imposter! Talk to him, friend."
"115740052-0-51068";"If the room has truly been locked this whole time, then not even the killer could reenter."
"115740052-0-51069";"Let us see if we can find any clues among the mess."
"115740052-0-51071";"The arcane knot is mine to claim!"
"115740052-0-51072";"I will have this power!"
"115740052-0-51073";"After this, no one will stop me."
"115740052-0-51074";"This looks very steep. You go on ahead. Keshargo will take his time."
"115740052-0-51077";"Pelena, is it true? After everything my aunt did for you?"
"115740052-0-51078";"I don't owe you an explanation, Aquilia."
"115740052-0-51079";"Turn up the flame valves as high as they'll go. I'll get rid of these research notes."
"115740052-0-51080";"You have got to be joking, the dog?"
"115740052-0-51081";"I can't believe it. There must be some mistake."
"115740052-0-51082";"There's no mistake, Otho. I will help oversee the transfer of ownership. You and Betu will have all your needs seen to."
"115740052-0-51083";"Excellent work, my friend. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-51084";"So this is what the arcane knot looks like."
"115740052-0-51085";"This one knew it was unstable but …. You take it. You'll be faster."
"115740052-0-51086";"You triggered something in the knot!"
"115740052-0-51087";"I recognize this place. Mortals worshiped me here."
"115740052-0-51088";"The null arca is right over here! Bring the knot. Quickly now!"
"115740052-0-51090";"Over here, tamiiti!"
"115740052-0-51091";"Ra'ham, tamiit. Let us speak before we question the townsfolk."
"115740052-0-51094";"The path to the Loom is below us. I shall open a way down."
"115740052-0-51095";"Tribune Alea's trapped by that portal! Careful, no telling what might emerge!"
"115740052-0-51096";"Abolisher's gathering energy from each foe you defeat."
"115740052-0-51097";"Abolisher is charged with power. Unleash it against the portal!"
"115740052-0-51098";"That damaged the portal! Gather more energy and try again!"
"115740052-0-51099";"You did it! The portal's closing!"
"115740052-0-51100";"Now we know how to use Abolisher to close Mirrormoor portals!"
"115740052-0-51101";"Hmm. Is this Vesper Valente really as special as it sounds?"
"115740052-0-51102";"Lord Valente is certainly proud of his new creation!"
"115740052-0-51103";"Fargrave … it feels like my necropolis, a city of the dead."
"115740052-0-51104";"Good, the gate to the Loom is still open."
"115740052-0-51105";"By the ancestors, look at this place! I remember when the walls of the Necropolis were my entire world …."
"115740052-0-51106";"Tread carefully, Gadayn. I prefer not to see any harm befall you."
"115740052-0-51107";"I still have the amulet you gave to keep me safe. I … I couldn't bear to part with it."
"115740052-0-51108";"I … I am glad it has been helpful. And that you still have it. More than I can say."
"115740052-0-51109";"Tears are opening up throughout the ruins. We barely made it here to warn you."
"115740052-0-51110";"Warriors of Mirrormoor, defend your Prince!"
"115740052-0-51111";"What's happen—"
"115740052-0-51112";"I warned you against interfering, mortal, but you refused to heed me."
"115740052-0-51113";"A reality tear? How fortuitous. Let this be the end of fate's chosen!"
"115740052-0-51114";"What in the name of all the Divines is that thing?"
"115740052-0-51115";"A Daedric apparatus of unimaginable power. What the One Who Knows feared."
"115740052-0-51116";"I see Ithelia, Shardmarshal Vargas, and Torvesard down there."
"115740052-0-51117";"Friend, look out! Agghh!"
"115740052-0-51118";"What are we waiting for then? Let's finish this."
"115740052-0-51119";"Interesting. Let's talk about how to proceed, friend."
"115740052-0-51120";"Hmm. Wouldn't that be something?"
"115740052-0-51121";"Ithelia has not yet activated the Loom. We can still intervene!"
"115740052-0-51123";"Defeat Shardmarshal Vargas so we can reach the Loom!"
"115740052-0-51125";"Damn it. Fine, then we make for Varen's Wall."
"115740052-0-51126";"I can already feel the pull on Eyevea. Nothing we can do now will outpace the greed of a Daedric Prince."
"115740052-0-51127";"I know that this situation is hard to accept, but I wish the Gryphon and the Fox would understand. This isn't a fight we can win."
"115740052-0-51128";"Ah good, you're here! Give it a listen."
"115740052-0-51129";"Curate Gadayn! He's … gone."
"115740052-0-51130";"Mourn later. We must get this fragment back to the others."
"115740052-0-51131";"I heard Lord Valente and his new bride loathe each other."
"115740052-0-51132";"Why would he marry a mortal? It's beneath him!"
"115740052-0-51133";"You can't stop us. And you can't stop the wildburn!"
"115740052-0-51134";"The Recollection … is endless!"
"115740052-0-51135";"Hey, wait! Don't be scared. I'm a friend! I think."
"115740052-0-51136";"Azalea? Is that you?"
"115740052-0-51137";"I've got a healing poultice here. I can make all that pain go away. You just need to talk."
"115740052-0-51138";"Ah… warm sands."
"115740052-0-51142";"Great! I've got my own way to get about, I'll see you at the next location."
"115740052-0-51146";"Scruut … is correct. This falls to you and me, proxy."
"115740052-0-51147";"Ciiril! What's the meaning of this? Someone explain to me what's going on!"
"115740052-0-51148";"The relics are this way … gathering dust on the tiny mortal's wall."
"115740052-0-51149";"The second key fragment! Look at you go!"
"115740052-0-51150";"Find the big cat by the water, and I bet that page will still be there. I believe in you!"
"115740052-0-51151";"Wow. It's cold in here. Let's be quick."
"115740052-0-51152";"And dig dig dig. Here you go!"
"115740052-0-51153";"Beragon's friend? For his sake, I will dispatch you quickly."
"115740052-0-51154";"The ritual! I cannot allow you to interfere!"
"115740052-0-51155";"My pets! So be it—I'll kill you myself!"
"115740052-0-51156";"Hey, you made it! Gryphon, this is the new friend I was telling you about. They're going to help you out!"
"115740052-0-51158";"Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy! It's me! Remember? The Fox!"
"115740052-0-51159";"I remember you, my friend. Don't worry. I've just been holding that in a long, long time."
"115740052-0-51160";"By Akatosh, Burnbiscuit! I mean, Lord Svendalmor! I'm so glad you're back! Let's talk, traveler!"
"115740052-0-51161";"No, no, no! How did you find us? You weren't supposed to find us."
"115740052-0-51163";"The energy is contained! Come here. Let Keshargo thank you."
"115740052-0-51164";"Now the mushrooms. A few well-placed torches should ignite the entire harvest."
"115740052-0-51165";"Ah! His injuries are too much for him. Healer, help Sergeant Luther Lentinius recover and take him to the barracks."
"115740052-0-51166";"Count Calantius, Lord Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits has been rescued, thanks to the bold efforts of this adventurer. I aided in their task."
"115740052-0-51167";"Oh!! My sweet fuzzy baby! My little Burnie-Wurnie! Who's my good bear? You are! Yes you are! Ah! Ahem …. You there, let's talk."
"115740052-0-51169";"Sergeant?! Oh my! I'm so excited I can barely … barely …"
"115740052-0-51170";"I've got them. What happened at the reservoir, deputy?"
"115740052-0-51171";"Ah, I see. Must've injured himself fighting those beasts out there. No matter. Healers? Heal this man. And make sure Burnbiscuit here didn't break a claw! Oh, you there. I suppose you want a reward?"
"115740052-0-51172";"I came as quick as I could. Search the wreckage for clues. It hurts when I bend down right now."
"115740052-0-51173";"The enemy approaches! They come to imprison my Prince."
"115740052-0-51174";"There you are! Finally. I just want to talk."
"115740052-0-51175";"You again! Stay away from me! Help! She's going to kill me!"
"115740052-0-51176";"No, wait! Ugh. This is hopeless."
"115740052-0-51177";"Ah, what is this? This one is flying!"
"115740052-0-51179";"Almost there!"
"115740052-0-51180";"This way! This door leads out of the sunken ruins."
"115740052-0-51182";"Let's look around. They must have left something useful behind."
"115740052-0-51184";"I wish the river would just carry me away."
"115740052-0-51185";"Sorilen wants to meet at the ruins east of here. Let's go."
"115740052-0-51187";"I created my scions to save me from a fate I finally accepted, though I had forgotten until you reminded me."
"115740052-0-51188";"No, my Prince! I am Dremora! I am eternal! I will reform and complete the task you set before me."
"115740052-0-51189";"Such is the nature of Daedra. Never changing. Never growing. I return your power to you, Mora! And I disperse mine into the Void!"
"115740052-0-51191";"And Torvesard, my most faithful. I consign your essence to nothingness, never to return. Be at peace at last."
"115740052-0-51194";"Our natures confound us. We need a different perspective. One you so elegantly provided. Mortal, let us speak."
"115740052-0-51195";"There are monsters everywhere! Just get away from me!"
"115740052-0-51196";"Anything interesting? Let me take a look."
"115740052-0-51197";"Beragon and Tribune Alea are beyond our help for now. We must go on without them."
"115740052-0-51198";"A metal disk? I think I recognize that. Hold onto it."
"115740052-0-51200";"A dormant portal! Proxy, we must find a way to activate it."
"115740052-0-51201";"Well done! The dormant portal has awakened."
"115740052-0-51213";"Not you again! You were with her. She sent you to kill me. I won't let you!"
"115740052-0-51214";"It's all right, darling. I'm here now, you don't have to run anymore."
"115740052-0-51215";"I was so scared. I didn't think the fear would ever end."
"115740052-0-51216";"Fear keeps us alive. You were doing your best. But let's work together from now on."
"115740052-0-51217";"Oh, my heart's racing! I don't like this place. Please, speak with me for a moment."
"115740052-0-51218";"There you are, darling. Let me share your burdens."
"115740052-0-51219";"Please, I don't want to be alone anymore."
"115740052-0-51220";"You won't be. Not ever again."
"115740052-0-51222";"Oh, I feel so heavy all of a sudden."
"115740052-0-51223";"Ithelia has walked the path to her exile. Take Boethiah's blade and destroy the portal. Cut off the path so that she may never return."
"115740052-0-51224";"Wait! We lost a … good friend to one of the reality tears. Is there anything …?"
"115740052-0-51225";"An excellent portal, Mora. Now—"
"115740052-0-51226";"As if Daedra weren't enough …. What was he thinking!"
"115740052-0-51227";"The tears were not my creation, only an effect of my passing."
"115740052-0-51228";"All I can offer is this wisdom to ease your mind."
"115740052-0-51229";"Drink up, friends! The next round is on me!"
"115740052-0-51230";"You hear that, barkeep? I've got a new drinking buddy!"
"115740052-0-51233";"Now is the time to put these stolen magics to use. Burn with the fires of the Deadlands."
"115740052-0-51234";"Let rise the shadows of Evergloam. And writhe with the ancient power of Apocrypha."
"115740052-0-51235";"Cheers to you, my friend! Well? Drink up!"
"115740052-0-51241";"That ale really packs a punch! I might take a nap for a minute."
"115740052-0-51244";"Well, that was embarrassing. Don't worry, I already took her back. Can we speak, friend?"
"115740052-0-51246";"No, no, no! I'm trapped! Please, someone help me!"
"115740052-0-51249";"I'm telling you, there's been a mistake! Give me a chance to explain!"
"115740052-0-51250";"Why don't you explain how you escaped? Or what you did to my wife?"
"115740052-0-51251";"What's going on, Elelorn? I just checked on the prisoner. She's secure."
"115740052-0-51252";"Finally, there you are! There's been a misunderstanding. Please, let me explain."
"115740052-0-51253";"Please, let my friend speak with your prisoner. We're all eager to resolve this."
"115740052-0-51254";"Very well, but we'll accompany you. Don't try anything."
"115740052-0-51255";"I don't like this, Sarragwen. They might use their vile magic on us!"
"115740052-0-51256";"What have we here? That's a new face. What a shame it's not prettier."
"115740052-0-51257";"How dare you? You had no right!"
"115740052-0-51258";"Calm yourself, Elelorn!"
"115740052-0-51259";"I can't believe it. Please, friend, I must speak with you!"
"115740052-0-51260";"This prisoner is my responsibility. Let me deal with her, and I'll submit myself to your judgement."
"115740052-0-51261";"Fine, but make it quick."
"115740052-0-51262";"Back off, you simpering fool!"
"115740052-0-51263";"Darling, we're one and the same. I'll accept you, but you'll never hurt anyone again."
"115740052-0-51264";"You can try to stop me, but we both know I'm part of you, and I always will be."
"115740052-0-51265";"I'm so sorry for what she, well, I, did to your wife. Let me make amends."
"115740052-0-51266";"Enough of your tricks! You can fix this by returning my wife to me!"
"115740052-0-51267";"I'll meet you in Vashabar. We have to find my vanity before she does something regrettable."
"115740052-0-51268";"No, you must not bring that reflection any closer! Speak with me and I shall explain."
"115740052-0-51269";"I know, little bug. Please, help me move this!"
"115740052-0-51271";"So many dead. What a waste …."
"115740052-0-51272";"That great skeleton above is one of the Bearers of Fargrave. Ithelia's changing it to its Mirrormoor reflection."
"115740052-0-51273";"We must hurry. I think I can create a portal shortcut."
"115740052-0-51274";"Proxy! Are you injured?"
"115740052-0-51275";"The Skein of Secrets never failed before. May I see the relic?"
"115740052-0-51276";"The knot isn't an object you can contain. Let us pass, Xoryn!"
"115740052-0-51277";"The knot will listen to me. It is mine!"
"115740052-0-51278";"It even weakened you for me. Now I can claim it with ease!"
"115740052-0-51279";"There is no reasoning with a fool. Protect the knot!"
"115740052-0-51288";"Guard the door! They must not reach the well!"
"115740052-0-51289";"The memory of a great battle? Who are Ithelia's forces fighting?"
"115740052-0-51290";"Up there! It's Shardmarshal Vargas!"
"115740052-0-51291";"Comrade? Comrade where are you?"
"115740052-0-51292";"Warriors of Mirrormoor, stand fast against Mora's minions!"
"115740052-0-51293";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-51294";"Pretty sure that's Hyacinth's work but it's old, or broken, I think."
"115740052-0-51296";"I don't need payment to kill you."
"115740052-0-51297";"I'm here, my friends!"
"115740052-0-51298";"When will I learn not to float casually into strange portals?"
"115740052-0-51299";"For Skingrad! For West Weald! For Nirn!"
"115740052-0-51300";"You're beating them? No matter, you'll never catch up to me."
"115740052-0-51301";"There's a door up here, too. We'll meet you on the other side."
"115740052-0-51302";"Hello, friend! Put the relics in the case, please—they may be powerless now, but we shouldn't forget the part they played in all this."
"115740052-0-51303";"I'm not sure I want to keep those in my house forever, but that's good for now. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-51304";"Good to see you, comrade. Beragon's waiting for you in the relic room."
"115740052-0-51305";"Aye!"
"115740052-0-51306";"Aye!"
"115740052-0-51307";"Aye!"
"115740052-0-51308";"Aye!"
"115740052-0-51309";"Give me that blade, Vargas."
"115740052-0-51310";"The shard will finish you!"
"115740052-0-51313";"Greenspeaker Darolith, Count Calantius. I'm afraid our friend has urgent business to take care of."
"115740052-0-51314";"Tribune Alea, will you escort the greenspeaker and the count home safely?"
"115740052-0-51315";"Consider it done."
"115740052-0-51316";"Do you see the arches before us? I think they mark the doorway to next part of the Loom."
"115740052-0-51319";"I sense something hidden here. Use the Lamp of Clarity, proxy … but carefully."
"115740052-0-51320";"The Lamp still functions—and it revealed a path. We should follow its guidance."
"115740052-0-51322";"The Recollection endures!"
"115740052-0-51323";"Intruders? Don't let them reach the signal fires!"
"115740052-0-51324";"This must be the Crow's domain. Incredible! Maybe those echoes can tell us more."
"115740052-0-51325";"This ritual has taken everything I had, and more. It worked, I think. And I will leave part of myself behind."
"115740052-0-51327";"Will it be enough for those that come after? Will anyone follow in my footsteps? I refuse to believe all this work was for nothing."
"115740052-0-51328";"My inheritor could come from anywhere, from a distant era. A brighter time, I dare to hope."
"115740052-0-51330";"I trust the Luminaries. They will ensure the right person steps into the role."
"115740052-0-51331";"Any attempt to save the Scholarium would only provoke Sheogorath. As far as I know, the Daedric Princes know nothing of the Luminaries."
"115740052-0-51333";"I have to seal this place away, though it feels like locking away part of my heart and soul. I suppose in some ways, it is."
"115740052-0-51335";"The Loom is destroyed, my Prince! We must leave this place!"
"115740052-0-51336";"Was something supposed to happen? Try looking at the fable again. Maybe there's a connection between the memory's name and a vow."
"115740052-0-51337";"You understand. And you are ready to take the next step."
"115740052-0-51338";"Welcome to the Labyrinthian! Or at least, my version of this ancient maze."
"115740052-0-51341";"Leramil, I summoned fate's chosen. Why are you here?"
"115740052-0-51342";"Pardon the impertinence, but we have done everything you asked. Now I have a request, Prince of Fate. Help me understand what Ithelia showed me."
"115740052-0-51343";"Ah, the Many Paths. You seek the return of the mortal, Gadayn. It is within my power to do this for a loyal servant, but there will be a cost."
"115740052-0-51344";"It is done. One day, Leramil, you who are called the Wise, I shall claim my due for this little boon. Be prepared to pay the cost at that time."
"115740052-0-51345";"Gadayn! The One Who Knows spoke true!"
"115740052-0-51346";"Leramil? Friend, wha-wa-what's going on?"
"115740052-0-51347";"And a greenspring seed for me. Friend, you helped us find them. Please bring them forth."
"115740052-0-51348";"These symbols represent our commitment to the village and to each other."
"115740052-0-51349";"When you are ready, I shall accompany you, proxy."
"115740052-0-51351";"How long before reinforcements arrive, do you think?"
"115740052-0-51352";"I knew Calvo could do it!"
"115740052-0-51353";"Those bandits won't stick around once an experienced Legion cohort arrives!"
"115740052-0-51354";"Someone's ringing the bell. Does that mean they made it?"
"115740052-0-51355";"We're done here."
"115740052-0-51356";"Agreed. You arse."
"115740052-0-51357";"Yffre's bones! Fine!"
"115740052-0-51358";"It's so desolate. How much of this is our doing?"
"115740052-0-51359";"Don't lose focus! Val, Knives, Big Urm—search the far side of the vineyard for signs of Marcan Caelum. I'll take this side with our friend."
"115740052-0-51360";"Leaving? I'll find you when you get back. Don't take long."
"115740052-0-51362";"Keep safe, everyone. May the Divines watch over us."
"115740052-0-51363";"Look! Here comes the adventurer the captain hired! But where's Calvo?"
"115740052-0-51364";"Calvo is ringing the bell?"
"115740052-0-51365";"The flames are gone. We're reset."
"115740052-0-51366";"I think someone's been using this grate to get in and out, but it's locked from the inside. Might lead to the cellar of the house."
"115740052-0-51367";"Calvo's a true legionary!"
"115740052-0-51368";"Ah, that might be the riddle to solve this!"
"115740052-0-51369";"Bless the Divines. Quickly! Please untie me!"
"115740052-0-51370";"Oh no, Florentina! Why did they have to kill her?"
"115740052-0-51371";"Poor Livius! We didn't like each other, but no one deserves such a fate."
"115740052-0-51372";"Olcinius was a good soldier. I hope he took a few of them with him!"
"115740052-0-51373";"The gate just went up. You did it!"
"115740052-0-51374";"Didn't you hear me? I said, try anything clever again and I'll gut you where you stand."
"115740052-0-51375";"Wisteria, I thought I knew you. But this is … no. I won't. I'm sorry."
"115740052-0-51376";"Beautiful! But I'd bet that's a quick trip down."
"115740052-0-51377";"Hello friends! You're not meant to go straight down. That's why I'm here!"
"115740052-0-51378";"Headstones? They're in good condition. Someone has been maintaining them."
"115740052-0-51379";"That's melted silver. This was where the house stood. One knocked-over candlestick, and this is all that's left."
"115740052-0-51380";"You give the report, comrade."
"115740052-0-51381";"Let's talk, friend."
"115740052-0-51383";"Beragon! You'll pay for this, Nantharion!"
"115740052-0-51384";"There it is! Now, I'll go get the others—"
"115740052-0-51385";"Didn't even know Daedra could climb ropes."
"115740052-0-51386";"I hope this makes them mad."
"115740052-0-51387";"That'll stop any Daedra. If they have legs."
"115740052-0-51388";"Careful! You need those hands to fight."
"115740052-0-51389";"I can sniff out the path as you break the wards."
"115740052-0-51390";"Dig, dig, dig. Here's a focal point to start you off. Watch your step!"
"115740052-0-51391";"Follow close and go quick! This is so fun!"
"115740052-0-51392";"Nice! We should be able to make it to the next platform."
"115740052-0-51393";"Thank Magnus, solid ground. Are we done?"
"115740052-0-51394";"We're done with the first half, yup! Get ready for part two!"
"115740052-0-51395";"Off we go! Keep up, and eyes out for those wards!"
"115740052-0-51396";"We're doing great! Keep it up!"
"115740052-0-51397";"Sorry friends, we're almost there. Almost done."
"115740052-0-51398";"Aww, we made it. We were so high up, that was so much fun. You did great!"
"115740052-0-51399";"Caelum has Val! She's been taken!"
"115740052-0-51400";"It's my fault. I said we should split up. Cover more ground."
"115740052-0-51401";"No one's fault but mine. I brought us here. Caelum won't kill her—yet. But we have to find them, quickly!"
"115740052-0-51402";"Nahlia, adventurer. You made it."
"115740052-0-51403";"Well, what do you say Vashabar? Do you support this union?"
"115740052-0-51404";"Hah, there it is! Congratulations you two. Let's give the couple a moment. Drinks for everyone!"
"115740052-0-51405";"Rise, Aut'arioth!"
"115740052-0-51406";"A fight, is it? This, this I can do."
"115740052-0-51407";"A marvelous display of power! Precisely what I wished to see."
"115740052-0-51408";"I am the Crow, a piece of Ulfsild left behind to see Scribing passed to you. To the world."
"115740052-0-51409";"The Luminaries. Look!"
"115740052-0-51410";"She wisely used her power to ensure her legacy."
"115740052-0-51411";"Ulfsild's keen mind ensured you could follow in her footsteps."
"115740052-0-51412";"She was a fierce protector, defiant for what she cared about most."
"115740052-0-51413";"Her compassion lifted everyone around her. Just as it lifted you!"
"115740052-0-51414";"I have soared on the winds of magic for centuries to be here with you today. Inheritor."
"115740052-0-51416";"I am the shadow of a singular person. A being born in sorrow but filled with hope."
"115740052-0-51417";"I know that smell. There's brandy in these casks."
"115740052-0-51418";"Are you certain you aren't smelling your own breath, Knives?"
"115740052-0-51419";"We'll guard this passage and fend off any Daedra."
"115740052-0-51420";"Quiet! I hear them—this way!"
"115740052-0-51421";"Locked! Big Urm, you know what to do. The rest of you, search for anything that might be of use!"
"115740052-0-51422";"Legionary Luther, for your bravery, I hereby promote you to the rank of sergeant. Serve Skingrad well!"
"115740052-0-51423";"Sergeant Luther?"
"115740052-0-51424";"Hang on. Me? Tend to the Scholarium?"
"115740052-0-51425";"What will I tell the Votary Commander? In … in the meantime let me get that portal to Eastmarch going."
"115740052-0-51426";"You'll do just fine, knight. I will await both of you back at the altar."
"115740052-0-51427";"I don't see a sigil, but she did leave us an echo."
"115740052-0-51428";"It's Ulfsild! But she looks older. Happier."
"115740052-0-51429";"It's been years since my time in the Scholarium, but I realized I never left a final message behind."
"115740052-0-51430";"As my life draws to a end, I've left a few things unsaid."
"115740052-0-51431";"My days will end soon, I think. But they end happy. With me at my little desk, in my little home, scratching away in some journals."
"115740052-0-51432";"I will. We will! I promise."
"115740052-0-51433";"Ulfsild left behind the sigil, your sigil. She had a long, happy life after the Scholarium, Crow."
"115740052-0-51434";"Does this mean we'll be moving on? Not that I don't love the smell of old tome dust."
"115740052-0-51435";"That's up to my colleague here. Nahlia, what's your plan?"
"115740052-0-51436";"I think … I think I'm going to stay on here. See what happens if we open the Scholarium to the world."
"115740052-0-51437";"Crow, how would you feel about us opening our doors to the Guild? Letting the world appreciate Ulfsild's legacy firsthand?"
"115740052-0-51439";"Another portal! Slay those Daedra and charge Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-51440";"Done! But I think I got too excited. My shoulder is busted."
"115740052-0-51441";"Fallen-Knives, see to Urm. We'll find Valenia and stop Caelum."
"115740052-0-51442";"Abolisher is charged! Strike the portal!"
"115740052-0-51443";"Good work, comrade! Hang onto that blade in case we run into another portal."
"115740052-0-51444";"Ah that's… something. Those bite marks are definitely from a troll."
"115740052-0-51445";"That's a troll claw, but look at the bluish smoke! Definitely one of those warped creatures."
"115740052-0-51446";"Mudcrab apples! Look at those cute little bite marks! This is definitely Burnbiscuit's doing!"
"115740052-0-51447";"You again! Why do you help the Scarlets? Is there more to take from me?"
"115740052-0-51448";"There they are! No sudden movements, friend. We need a plan."
"115740052-0-51450";"Enough of this!"
"115740052-0-51451";"Valenia!"
"115740052-0-51452";"Maybe, but the Wood Elves of Vashabar claim their intentions are peaceful."
"115740052-0-51455";"That's not what I heard. There's even a Wood Elf and a legionary working with an adventurer to stop the Recollection."
"115740052-0-51458";"Face the swarm, intruder!"
"115740052-0-51460";"The Recollection and those rogue Daedra are on the run, thanks to them!"
"115740052-0-51461";"No! I am done!"
"115740052-0-51462";"Prove your mettle, outsider!"
"115740052-0-51463";"We're not so different!"
"115740052-0-51464";"I yield!"
"115740052-0-51465";"The remaining Scarlets. Good. All in one place … We'll … we'll see them all, soon."
"115740052-0-51467";"Some of those unstable orbs, again. Blocking our path."
"115740052-0-51469";"That did it."
"115740052-0-51470";"Ah ha ha ha!"
"115740052-0-51471";"The fire's spreading!"
"115740052-0-51472";"No quarter, nonbeliever!"
"115740052-0-51473";"The exit is blocked! We're trapped!"
"115740052-0-51474";"There! The sewer grate! We can get out that way!"
"115740052-0-51483";"What? No!"
"115740052-0-51484";"Argh!"
"115740052-0-51486";"So … all the Scarlets have come. Good. We'll all burn here … as they did."
"115740052-0-51487";"You cannot deny my vengeance. You wanted my riches? Take them to your graves!"
"115740052-0-51488";"It doesn't stop. I'll be hearing that rutting buzzing for days!"
"115740052-0-51489";"Thanks to you. And your new friend."
"115740052-0-51490";"Val … oh gods. Valenia!"
"115740052-0-51491";"Friends, we should remember the Scarlets who aren't here. Before we go our separate ways again."
"115740052-0-51492";"I have places to be, but they can wait. I'll be there. And I won't be drinking."
"115740052-0-51493";"I agree. I wish we had come together before all this. Hooke?"
"115740052-0-51494";"I'd like that. Aye, I'd like that a lot."
"115740052-0-51495";"That was too close! Knives, tend to Val."
"115740052-0-51496";"She will live, but that wound is severe. I'm sorry, Val. That arm may never be the same."
"115740052-0-51497";"Hooke. If you're planning to escort Valenia to her family, I'd like to join you."
"115740052-0-51498";"I'll meet you soon. There's something I have to do in Black Marsh. It might help Val."
"115740052-0-51499";"You all … don't have to do … so much for me."
"115740052-0-51500";"Well, maybe we're not quite ready to part again just yet."
"115740052-0-51501";"The Eight brought us back together, Hooke. We shouldn't depart in haste."
"115740052-0-51502";"I'm sorry. I never thought splitting up would get Val—"
"115740052-0-51503";"Hush, Fallen-Knives. No one's blaming you."
"115740052-0-51504";"I'll … I'll take Valenia to Marbruk. To her family. It's what she would have wanted."
"115740052-0-51505";"Ah, good. You must be our backup. Irnard came through."
"115740052-0-51506";"Magnus watch over you, Nahlia. We'll keep watch out here."
"115740052-0-51507";"Nahlia and the others are inside. Stay safe in there."
"115740052-0-51508";"Noraine—to me. Now."
"115740052-0-51510";"You there! Let's help these people."
"115740052-0-51511";"Not yet, friend! We can't enter the bell tower until we recover everything the captain requested."
"115740052-0-51512";"I'll be damned, there are survivors! Use the key and open the vault."
"115740052-0-51513";"Oh! Please, help. It's all destroyed."
"115740052-0-51514";"I hoped things could have ended differently with Marcan. But we're all safe. I couldn't ask for more."
"115740052-0-51516";"Hey! Help a High Elf out?"
"115740052-0-51520";"Watch out!"
"115740052-0-51533";"No picks? I might have a loose one around here somewhere …."
"115740052-0-51534";"Now! Strike the portal with Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-51535";"Use Abolisher on the portal, friend!"
"115740052-0-51541";"All these defenses. Meant to protect … what?"
"115740052-0-51544";"Whatever is causing this, I think it's in the next room. Come on!"
"115740052-0-51547";"You're part of my army now, barkeep. Get used to it."
"115740052-0-51553";"That scarf. I gave it to Wisteria."
"115740052-0-51554";"Wait, you? Why are you helping me?"
"115740052-0-51555";"I knew it. Trouble follows you again, Mother."
"115740052-0-51556";"Stairs to the west. They must lead to an inner chamber!"
"115740052-0-51557";"There, to the south. I think I see something!"
"115740052-0-51558";"A Mirrormoor portal! Ready Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-51559";"Daedra keep pouring through! Get ready to use Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-51560";"My Prince, help me!"
"115740052-0-51561";"Oh no. You're not going to ruin this for us!"
"115740052-0-51563";"Arkay help us! This place is full of traps!"
"115740052-0-51564";"Of course. Please, allow me to reverse the spell."
"115740052-0-51565";"Oh, thank Y'ffre that's over!"
"115740052-0-51566";"Mindiras, my love, you're back! Sarragwen, I revoke my charges. Let the stranger leave and put this behind us."
"115740052-0-51567";"Very well. You are both free to go."
"115740052-0-51568";"Now! Give them no quarter!"
"115740052-0-51569";"Watch out! The Shardmarshal's waiting for us!"
"115740052-0-51570";"Thank you. And you, friend. I won't forget all your help in this."
"115740052-0-51571";"Umbolwe, tend their wounds! Giovanni, keep an eye on that horizon. Gods help me if we're taken by surprise here."
"115740052-0-51573";"This horrid relic rose from the ground. I need to talk."
"115740052-0-51574";"My fable, my story, ends where it began. Now go. And scribe your own."
"115740052-0-51575";"Who, Gaius? Who attacked Rustwall?"
"115740052-0-51576";"The gardens are just east of here, down the hill."
"115740052-0-51578";"Back here, comrade. I found Captain Leronus."
"115740052-0-51579";"By my sword, a legionary! Report, soldier."
"115740052-0-51581";"Now let's find a way out of here!"
"115740052-0-51582";"Traveler! Do you know what happened to the cohort at Rustwall?"
"115740052-0-51583";"Focus! We cannot afford to falter!"
"115740052-0-51584";"Shardborn, protect the portal!"
"115740052-0-51585";"Fight on, champions of Mirrormoor!"
"115740052-0-51586";"It's not just about reclaiming what was lost. This is about our heritage!"
"115740052-0-51587";"Soon Dawnwood will spread and drive out those Colovian bastards."
"115740052-0-51588";"Mortal! What part of the end of all existence didn't you understand?"
"115740052-0-51589";"Sorilen! You're alive!"
"115740052-0-51590";"Look around you. This forest is just the first of the changes we have been promised."
"115740052-0-51591";"Maybe. But it's up to us to earn those promised rewards. We'll have to fight for them."
"115740052-0-51592";"Did you get it? Don't dawdle, pour us a round!"
"115740052-0-51594";"Beragon! Oh, who's your friend?"
"115740052-0-51595";"Make sure no one follows me."
"115740052-0-51596";"The knot belongs to me! You can't have it!"
"115740052-0-51597";"Hang on, I think I've figured it out. Let me know if you want any help."
"115740052-0-51598";"Keep an eye out, could be anything in here."
"115740052-0-51599";"You two go ahead. That report we found. I want to check on Feldagard Keep."
"115740052-0-51600";"You two go ahead. I need to report to Count Calantius. I'll catch up with you later."
"115740052-0-51601";"That's right, mercenary. I bear another message."
"115740052-0-51602";"The Recollection seeks justice, Beragon. For all Bosmer!"
"115740052-0-51603";"Spilled blood and displaced families aren't justice!"
"115740052-0-51604";"We've been friends forever! Why won't you trust me?"
"115740052-0-51605";"The Recollection destroyed this village! Who knows what other harm the rapid growth caused?"
"115740052-0-51607";"I thought you'd understand. I thought you had vision. Goodbye, Beragon."
"115740052-0-51608";"No, Sorilen! Wait!"
"115740052-0-51611";"Needs more heat."
"115740052-0-51612";"First, place the tirum weed in the apparatus."
"115740052-0-51613";"Slowly apply heat to steep the tirum weed."
"115740052-0-51614";"Too hot! Reduce the heat."
"115740052-0-51615";"You burned that batch. We'll have to start over."
"115740052-0-51616";"That looks nicely steeped! Next, place the harkfruit in the apparatus."
"115740052-0-51617";"It needs to be hotter."
"115740052-0-51618";"You'll burn the fruit. Reduce the heat!"
"115740052-0-51619";"Harkfruit burns easily. Let's try again."
"115740052-0-51620";"The harkfruit looks properly reduced. Now add lute berries to the apparatus."
"115740052-0-51621";"It needs to be cooler."
"115740052-0-51622";"It's getting too cold. Don't freeze them!"
"115740052-0-51623";"Ah, we froze the lute berries. We can start over."
"115740052-0-51624";"Perfectly chilled! Now to blend the drink. Two parts steeped tirum weed and harkfruit juice for every one part of chilled lute berries."
"115740052-0-51625";"That's the perfect amount of tirum weed. Don't add anymore."
"115740052-0-51626";"That's just the right amount of harkfruit juice. No need for more."
"115740052-0-51627";"That's the exact amount of lute berries we need."
"115740052-0-51628";"Looks like a perfectly blended Sage's Dream! Pour the finished drink into that carafe."
"115740052-0-51630";"I made this lens so you might see the world as I do. The very warp and weft of magic laid out before me."
"115740052-0-51631";"A look through the lens will allow you to see impressions left behind by the Luminaries. Follow these signposts, and you will find their domains."
"115740052-0-51632";"Now enter the focal point and peer through the lens. You will see what was unseen in the fable."
"115740052-0-51633";"I … heh. I didn't play nice. Ow. It hurts to smile."
"115740052-0-51634";"Ceythalmor? This isn't good. Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-51635";"Have some faith, it's unlocked. Let me help you, Wisteria."
"115740052-0-51636";"Excellent! The wards are nearby. Seek the key fragment. Walk the path."
"115740052-0-51637";"Impressive, isn't she? Let's talk outside. I want to make sure she's all right."
"115740052-0-51638";"Gather your feathers about you. The last fragment is within those ruins."
"115740052-0-51639";"You've flown true, the Luminary Indrik's door is close. Find a path to the top, and take the next step on your journey."
"115740052-0-51640";"It has been many long years since a mortal entered my domain. And now here you are, following in Ulfsild's footsteps."
"115740052-0-51642";"You are free, little one. Free to … what? Ah, of course. You may return with us if you wish."
"115740052-0-51643";"You're incorrigible. Ow!"
"115740052-0-51644";"You will live, Brendenir."
"115740052-0-51645";"You have completed my trials. You have shown wisdom in the use of your power."
"115740052-0-51646";"Take my sigil. Join its essence with the altar. And let the ink flow once again."
"115740052-0-51647";"Pirsisa, do we have more water for the wounded?"
"115740052-0-51648";"This one will look. But it's doubtful."
"115740052-0-51649";"There you are! I wanted to introduce you. This is Chronicler Firandil."
"115740052-0-51650";"Good to meet you. Nahlia and I have been touring the library and I've already found … well. Some terribly surprising things!"
"115740052-0-51651";"Firandil is a chronicler, one of the best the guild has to offer. You two talk a moment, and then we can discuss what comes next."
"115740052-0-51652";"Of course! Happy to be of service."
"115740052-0-51656";"Over here, mercenary! I bring another message."
"115740052-0-51657";"My toes have gone numb and I can't feel my knees!"
"115740052-0-51660";"You're back! Good—I made some progress with the Hoperoot map. Let's talk."
"115740052-0-51661";"Too much tirum weed. We'll start a new blend."
"115740052-0-51662";"You poured too much harkfruit juice. No problem, we'll start again."
"115740052-0-51663";"That's too many lute berries. We'll begin again."
"115740052-0-51665";"No Recollection sentries? There must be a reason why they're not guarding this passage."
"115740052-0-51666";"This looks promising! I think we're close to the parts of Niryastare I remember."
"115740052-0-51667";"Just think! No one's set foot in here in ages … except for any Ayleid undead that might be around."
"115740052-0-51668";"The Loom awaits, my Prince. Reshape the fates and restore the glory of Mirrormoor!"
"115740052-0-51669";"Mirrormoor stands ready, my Prince. Weave a better reality with your Loom!"
"115740052-0-51672";"Vargas is shielded, friend! Use Abolisher to destroy the portals!"
"115740052-0-51674";"Let's see how clever you are, mortal."
"115740052-0-51675";"Wish me luck, friend. Hopefully the Votary Commander has had her morning tea."
"115740052-0-51676";"Good job! Over here! The creatia is just through this door, I can smell it!"
"115740052-0-51679";"Over there, friend! A spot to use your lens!"
"115740052-0-51680";"This note smells like the nearby room, we must be getting close!"
"115740052-0-51683";"We rejoin the Scholarium, as it should be. Let's converse."
"115740052-0-51684";"Adventurer, hah! I found you."
"115740052-0-51685";"This place is massive! And so beautiful."
"115740052-0-51686";"Go on ahead. I'll be right behind you. Llaren would kill me if I didn't take a few rubbings before we leave."
"115740052-0-51687";"Climbed up here. Full plate armor on. Huge mistake."
"115740052-0-51688";"Looks like you found something, at least."
"115740052-0-51689";"No matter, mortal. More of our forces will come through soon."
"115740052-0-51690";"Here, friend! The entrance is just up this hillside."
"115740052-0-51691";"Hyacinth will want to hear what happened. And I need to break the news about Oleander."
"115740052-0-51692";"As you say, Shardmarshal Vargas. We have more than enough weapons now."
"115740052-0-51694";"This way, tribune! Follow the tracks!"
"115740052-0-51696";"Sunnamere. I wonder what it means? I never gave it a second thought before."
"115740052-0-51697";"That's right. This portal closed once I brought the others through."
"115740052-0-51698";"That Ulfsild echo is still quiet. Is there anything else hidden around here?"
"115740052-0-51699";"Hyacinth bought a ballista? Amazing."
"115740052-0-51702";"To whomever follows in my footsteps, I leave behind a transcribed copy of Mizbi's fable. This should help you on your quest."
"115740052-0-51703";"Look for the last of my notes in the remote holdfast of Paragon's Remembrance. And good luck with the Dragon."
"115740052-0-51704";"I knew I wasn't crazy about Mizbi. This is so interesting."
"115740052-0-51705";"Sounds like we're off to Paragon's Remembrance in Wrothgar. Allow me, adventurer."
"115740052-0-51706";"Not quite the welcome I was expecting. This place must have been very different back in Ulfsild's time."
"115740052-0-51707";"I'll guard your backside. Head in, and I'll be right behind you."
"115740052-0-51708";"There you are! Those are her notes?"
"115740052-0-51709";"Let's get back the Scholarium, and we can go over everything we've found."
"115740052-0-51710";"You return! Carrying a riddle for me, I hope."
"115740052-0-51712";"How big is this place? You could hide half of Tamriel down here!"
"115740052-0-51713";"Beragon! Damn. He's charging ahead without us!"
"115740052-0-51714";"A strange story, but Mizzik has encountered many strange truths. We must speak with the others."
"115740052-0-51716";"Look! An anomaly like the one we observed at Wendir. We must try Abolisher, no matter the risk."
"115740052-0-51717";"Oh Great and Glorious Netch! Your cleverness exceeds us. We beseech your aid in finding your true fable. Guide us to your netchy bosom. Make our lofty dreams come true!"
"115740052-0-51718";"Look, down there!"
"115740052-0-51719";"That's Vargas! Looks like she's in command of these Recollection."
"115740052-0-51720";"Good timing, friend. Come, let's give the others some space."
"115740052-0-51721";"Legionary Caepio is right. We need to shut down that portal."
"115740052-0-51722";"The portal! Destroy the anchors, comrade!"
"115740052-0-51724";"Keep your ears open. Follow any shouts for help."
"115740052-0-51725";"I don't see Greenspeaker Sorilen. Wait. A body on the ground. They're wearing Recollection gear. Grab that note."
"115740052-0-51726";"Troll! That's a big troll!"
"115740052-0-51727";"Let's find Sorilen first, friend."
"115740052-0-51728";"I knew it. The place is thick with the Recollection."
"115740052-0-51729";"You're right. These ruins are incredible!"
"115740052-0-51730";"Sorilen has a point. These ruins are too wondrous to let sit forgotten."
"115740052-0-51731";"Blight and root rot! How could Sorilen join the Recollection? They're murderers!"
"115740052-0-51733";"Another obstacle. Use the Lamp here, if you would."
"115740052-0-51734";"I think we need the Lamp's light again."
"115740052-0-51735";"Wendir? Does that mean anything to you, Leramil?"
"115740052-0-51736";"These creatures only exist in the Dawnwood. They look so strange."
"115740052-0-51737";"Only one remaining, Not-Ulfsild. Nahlia, a portal to Blight Bog Sump please!"
"115740052-0-51738";"Well done, Not-Ulfsild! Nahlia will see you back to Suran. Where father and son reunite."
"115740052-0-51739";"Loftily done. Nahlia, the next portal, if you please. To Borderwatch Ruins you go."
"115740052-0-51740";"Take my sigil. Use it to amplify the altar. And seek to better the world through your scribing."
"115740052-0-51741";"Be sure to thank Nahlia. And don't be a stranger, or I'll find an excuse to start wandering the Scholarium again."
"115740052-0-51742";"Those doors! Let's try there. We need to find that seed."
"115740052-0-51743";"The Lamp! Its power is … gone. At least we saved Tribune Alea."
"115740052-0-51744";"Now that we are together again, let us find an exit from this place."
"115740052-0-51745";"They won't give up the pod without a fight!"
"115740052-0-51746";"Thank the Singer that's over."
"115740052-0-51747";"There you are. I just got back myself."
"115740052-0-51748";"An old mine, maybe?"
"115740052-0-51750";"Ah, at last. We come to the final wing."
"115740052-0-51751";"Congratulations. You've accomplished incredible things."
"115740052-0-51752";"Through you, my work finally lives on. Gather any allies you choose."
"115740052-0-51753";"We will see if the Crow deems you worthy. If you are the inheritor of the Scholarium. See you on the other side."
"115740052-0-51754";"It's time for your final trial? The last door?"
"115740052-0-51757";"Use my strength well."
"115740052-0-51758";"Rejoin my domain to the altar. May you master Scribing as you master yourself."
"115740052-0-51759";"Go, and carry my strength. You will always be welcome here."
"115740052-0-51760";"I understand … and I accept."
"115740052-0-51761";"Now, leave us."
"115740052-0-51762";"What are they pointing at?"
"115740052-0-51763";"… Royal lavender. Got it! I jotted it down, so we won't forget."
"115740052-0-51764";"Here, you should hold the note I wrote. I tend to lose things."
"115740052-0-51767";"Our way forward! Now the real work begins."
"115740052-0-51768";"The aesthetics of Mirrormoor have a certain beauty, but they do not belong in Apocrypha."
"115740052-0-51769";"I sense more than just the master of Apocrypha ahead. We must find Ithelia!"
"115740052-0-51770";"Keep draining Mora, scion. I will deal with his champions!"
"115740052-0-51771";"With pleasure, my Prince."
"115740052-0-51772";"What … what did I see? Mortal, tell me what this means!"
"115740052-0-51773";"Mortal, my scion has taken the power. You must stop Torvesard!"
"115740052-0-51774";"Beragon, Scruut, Tribune Alea! Lend your might to fate's chosen!"
"115740052-0-51775";"The legendary Labyrinthian maze. I guess I should have noted the path from the invisible walkways. But I took the Fox's advice very seriously."
"115740052-0-51776";"She called the blade Abolisher. It's all yours, comrade."
"115740052-0-51777";"The Crow is a Luminary. She's just so different from the others. I wonder why."
"115740052-0-51778";"My sister's trapped! We need help!"
"115740052-0-51779";"Is that ward sustaining the orbs?"
"115740052-0-51780";"One last portal for you, my friend."
"115740052-0-51781";"I'm … relieved to hear it. The altar is yours, inheritor."
"115740052-0-51782";"I believe Ulfsild the Evergreen would have loved that."
"115740052-0-51785";"You dare use Abolisher against me?"
"115740052-0-51786";"I shall aid Hermaeus Mora while you try to stop Torvesard."
"115740052-0-51787";"No! We are too close! I claim the power! I will finish this!"
"115740052-0-51788";"One moment, proxy."
"115740052-0-51790";"Do you feel the Ritual Stone vibrating? No? Uh. Me neither."
"115740052-0-51793";"All right, you old arse. The village has spoken so let's make the best of this."
"115740052-0-51794";"I suppose you're right, you bastard. If we're going to be kin, let's get to drinking like it."
"115740052-0-51795";"What's going on here?"
"115740052-0-51797";"Fetid bones! Look out!"
"115740052-0-51798";"Blasted wretch, have mercy!"
"115740052-0-51799";"It worked! Thank you, illusory poetry bird!"
"115740052-0-51800";"Kill them, my Shardborn! Recover Abolisher!"
"115740052-0-51801";"Well, we made it! Let's go see this new greenhouse!"
"115740052-0-51802";"That's far enough, baron!"
"115740052-0-51804";"Welcome, Bogcup. And you must be their curious new friend."
"115740052-0-51805";"Hmm. I see you managed to solve his riddles."
"115740052-0-51806";"Commander, the ballista's destroyed! They'll breach the courtyard soon."
"115740052-0-51807";"Daedra on the left side. Stop them!"
"115740052-0-51808";"No! We lost a legionary."
"115740052-0-51809";"You saved the legionary! We'll get him back inside."
"115740052-0-51810";"Daedra approaching on the right side. Protect the legionary!"
"115740052-0-51811";"We lost the legionary. There's too many Daedra!"
"115740052-0-51812";"The legionary's safe. Nice work."
"115740052-0-51813";"Look! Greenspeaker Sorilen, up on the walkway."
"115740052-0-51815";"You have the arcane knot?"
"115740052-0-51816";"The null arca is right there!"
"115740052-0-51818";"Go! Finish what we started!"
"115740052-0-51819";"The work isn't over yet."
"115740052-0-51820";"Contain the knot or this will never be finished."
"115740052-0-51821";"Comrade, Beragon waits for you upstairs on the balcony. Go talk to him."
"115740052-0-51823";"Look at that ink shimmer. Well done!"
"115740052-0-51824";"Stand, knights of the Scholarium. Begin your watch. May it never end."
"115740052-0-51826";"Allow me to talk to Hermaeus Mora first, proxy."
"115740052-0-51835";"That's terrible! Did they offer any explanation?"
"115740052-0-51837";"Bet there's lots of old notes down here."
"115740052-0-51838";"An illusion? It seems distorted."
"115740052-0-51839";"Snapdragon's been arrested? We need to talk to those adepts."
"115740052-0-51840";"Ugh … that wasn't the best idea I've ever had."
"115740052-0-51841";"The reeve's office. That's a great suggestion! Let's get over to the manor."
"115740052-0-51842";"I'll hang back, that blast took a lot out of me."
"115740052-0-51845";"Why, stranger? Why? That was going to be my new pet!"
"115740052-0-51846";"If we are to quell this magic, we must focus it into a new creation. Place your hands on the altar."
"115740052-0-51847";"This is the Scribing Altar. Make this Grimoire your own."
"115740052-0-51854";"For now, I have given you what little ink we have left in the Scholarium. It's been many long years since the library saw regular use, and ink is now a rare resource."
"115740052-0-51856";"The skill is scribed. The magic of the Scholarium is calmed."
"115740052-0-51857";"I fought with everything I had. My wife was at home by herself. She told me she had news for me for when I returned. I needed to know what it was."
"115740052-0-51858";"He was still a little boy when I put that wooden sword in his hands. I had convinced myself that he would aspire to be like me. That he was a fighter."
"115740052-0-51859";"Stand clear!"
"115740052-0-51860";"Stand back!"
"115740052-0-51861";"A portal! Careful, I do not expect anything good to emerge."
"115740052-0-51862";"Remember, Abolisher gathers energy from each foe you fell."
"115740052-0-51863";"Abolisher is charged. Unleash it on the portal!"
"115740052-0-51864";"The portal is damaged! Gather more energy and do it again."
"115740052-0-51865";"That did it! The portal is closing."
"115740052-0-51866";"Remember Abolisher's power should we encounter more of these Mirrormoor portals."
"115740052-0-51867";"Proxy, use Abolisher on the portal!"
"115740052-0-51870";"We need aid. Beragon, come forth!"
"115740052-0-51871";"Scruut, we need you!"
"115740052-0-51872";"Tribune Alea, come forth!"
"115740052-0-51873";"Torvesard is vulnerable! Attack him now!"
"115740052-0-51874";"Attack Torvesard now, proxy!"
"115740052-0-51875";"Fly back to me when you have followed Ulfsild's instructions."
"115740052-0-51876";"Huh. You don't see that every day. Nahlia's going to want to hear about this."
"115740052-0-51877";"Good to see you again! You'll find her over in the east wing with our newest arrival."
"115740052-0-51879";"We're here! And no one even noticed as we sailed by, thanks to Hyacinth. Come on, Snapdragon's cell should be on the west side of the fortress."
"115740052-0-51881";"As you command, Shardmarshal Vargas."
"115740052-0-51882";"Let's deal with these Shardborn, comrade. Don't let them recover the sword."
"115740052-0-51883";"We need a way out. Try to use the blade the way Vargas did."
"115740052-0-51885";"These shelves were full in our reality. Not ransacked like this."
"115740052-0-51886";"My Shardborn. They always served me well."
"115740052-0-51887";"Reality in this path is extremely fragile. It might shatter. Hurry."
"115740052-0-51888";"I remember this as a place filled with light and joy. This is not that place."
"115740052-0-51889";"And you're off like a racing frog! Let me know if you want to confer about the directions in the fable."
"115740052-0-51890";"You return. Echoes of your success precede you."
"115740052-0-51891";"And with that, the power of the Dragon has been restored to the altar."
"115740052-0-51892";"We've done all we can here. Let's head back to the Scholarium and speak with you know who."
"115740052-0-51893";"You're here! The wall is thinnest at the back of the ruin. I'll see you there!"
"115740052-0-51894";"Welcome to Rootwater Grove! I can smell my way to Apocrypha. I'll meet you where the wall is thinnest!"
"115740052-0-51895";"Here comes the mercenary now. Talk to Beragon, comrade."
"115740052-0-51896";"Follow that fly!"
"115740052-0-51897";"I'm not done yet."
"115740052-0-51898";"Of course. Oh, I hope Wisteria made it back all right."
"115740052-0-51900";"We'll see you at Hoperoot, friend!"
"115740052-0-51901";"Maybe there's something with the Echos and that book. See if they have anything more to say."
"115740052-0-51902";"You have potential. But you do not understand yet."
"115740052-0-51903";"I will bring your murderer to justice, father. This I swear."
"115740052-0-51904";"Xoryn said we had competition. But you don't look like too much trouble."
"115740052-0-51905";"Dominion soldiers? Let's stay well clear."
"115740052-0-51906";"Ha ha!"
"115740052-0-51907";"Wait, the path isn't down there! Come back!"
"115740052-0-51908";"Not just your hand, th'murr. I felt the words and guidance of your tamiit through our connection. You reached past the darkness and found me."
"115740052-0-51909";"This is where I leave you. I know you can do it! Good luck!"
"115740052-0-51910";"Over there! Try the key in that desk."
"115740052-0-51911";"Shardborn? What are they doing here?"
"115740052-0-51912";"I am the Unweaver! I am the Dark Tomorrow! I am the last path you will ever walk!"
"115740052-0-51913";"No, I cannot be undone by a mortal!"
"115740052-0-51914";"<The sound of feathered wings.>"
"115740052-0-51915";"Oh, good heavens! I say!"
"115740052-0-51916";"Despite it all, it seems we are fated to battle. Face me, mortal!"
"115740052-0-51917";"Act with justice."
"115740052-0-51918";"Use your power responsibly."
"115740052-0-51919";"Develop a keen mind."
"115740052-0-51920";"Stay buoyant and breezy."
"115740052-0-51921";"Steeping yourself in the primordial fear of my domain for one little Wood Elf? Foolish mortal. You'll make a finer meal than she."
"115740052-0-51922";"Zerith speaks of Jode's Light. West of Dune in Reaper's March. There is a ritual chamber at the back of the western atrium. For the ritual of Ku-ji'zho, yes?"
"115740052-0-51923";"I am glad to hear it is still known in this time. You are welcome to travel with us, ja'rithantii."
"115740052-0-51924";"I would not miss it! I will gather the components needed for this ritual and meet you there."
"115740052-0-51925";"Welcome! Khenarthi blessed me with swift travels and I have prepared the chamber. All we need now is the two of you."
"115740052-0-51926";"Jode's love and S'rendarr's charity! Thank you, Krin'ze."
"115740052-0-51927";"Tamiit, you will lead us through my past as we peer into the shadows of memory. Begin by igniting the braziers here."
"115740052-0-51928";"Kneel with me before the altar. Together we will spin my memories from the moon-sugar in the air."
"115740052-0-51931";"<unhinged scream of rage>"
"115740052-0-51932";"You may dredge forth some hope for that Dark Elf, but his fears will always bring him back to me. Your fears will do the same."
"115740052-0-51933";"Let us make haste to Goldfolly. We may still be able to save Cantor Izalgo."
"115740052-0-51934";"My moonclaw. It senses dro-m'Athra nearby. Let us look around."
"115740052-0-51941";"How strange to enter a place long-dead and sense life. I believe … yes. Cantor Krin'ze is near."
"115740052-0-51942";"No, no, no. Something bad happened here! Hyacinth! Snapdragon?"
"115740052-0-51946";"Ja'rithantii! Krin'ze? She cannot hear me. See if you can reach her, tamiit."
"115740052-0-51947";"Tamiiti, Azurah beckons you to this place, just as she did this singing soul."
"115740052-0-51948";"Whatever you ask, Talbira. I am determined to make things right."
"115740052-0-51949";"Snapdragon. Please. No."
"115740052-0-51950";"A house of scrolls. Wisdom scattered to the dirt. Let us see what knowledge we might salvage."
"115740052-0-51951";"I can feel the fear on you, but you're alive? How?"
"115740052-0-51952";"Zerith-var, fallen star. Last shadow of the Hidden Moon. Their word and creed live again in you. Remember this."
"115740052-0-51953";"The armory. Blessings on these weapons have long since faded. We might restore them with moon-sugar water, if we can find any."
"115740052-0-51955";"Heed me, Zerith-var. A weapon that loses its edge can be restored. What of you?"
"115740052-0-51956";"I'll take great pleasure snuffing out the hope you've rekindled in my Haunted. I'll be there soon to drag every last one of you back to Detritus—for all eternity!"
"115740052-0-51957";"These bones belonged to brothers and sisters of the Hidden Moon. They deserve better than to bleach in the sun."
"115740052-0-51958";"Their souls have long passed, but let us see to the interment of their remains."
"115740052-0-51959";"Minister to the dead, Zerith-var, but forget not the living. Forget not to tend to yourself."
"115740052-0-51960";"We restored what we could. Let us return to Krin'ze and hope we made this place better than when we found it."
"115740052-0-51961";"These grounds are hallowed once more, twin moons. You repaired Khenarthi's Rise. Now, we repair the spirit."
"115740052-0-51962";"Zerith? Walker? I felt Azurah call to you! I feared you might not answer."
"115740052-0-51966";"Could she really ask for something so simple?"
"115740052-0-51968";"Such darkness! And so near. Those bodies. Are they Inquisitors?"
"115740052-0-51969";"Combat ahead. The Inquisitors must have hunted the Rajaska, but their faith did not protect them."
"115740052-0-51970";"You two! Thank the moons! Is Krin'ze here, too?"
"115740052-0-51972";"I will tend to Viti while you do what you can for the other Twilight Cantors. Send for me when you find Ravith-morna."
"115740052-0-51973";"I am here, Viti! Thank Azurah you are all right."
"115740052-0-51976";"The moon beast! Are we too late?"
"115740052-0-51977";"Like redemption, it is never too late. Let us show Ravith this is so."
"115740052-0-51978";"Answer this dirge with our song of battle!"
"115740052-0-51979";"Your heart allowed me to return to Nirni and bring my moon beast to life, th'murr. Should your soul be the first it drags into the dark?"
"115740052-0-51980";"Do not listen to her, Zerith. Your path turns from the darkness."
"115740052-0-51981";"The moon beast. It fades into the Void. We did it!"
"115740052-0-51982";"Ravith. You accepted redemption. I cast a hand into the darkness and you took it."
"115740052-0-51983";"Our paths divide here. Walk your second pounce with lightness and purpose, Zerith-var. May we never again hold so fast to the darkness in our own hearts."
"115740052-0-51984";"Let the wings of Khenarthi bear you to the Crossing, Ravith."
"115740052-0-51985";"The portal to Nirni is open, friends. Let us return together."
"115740052-0-51987";"Fool! All you've done is postpone his torment. The blood he's shed will always stain his soul. His fears will always lead him back to me. I reject your intrusion. Begone!"
"115740052-0-51988";"You failed. Let him go. Please."
"115740052-0-51989";"Tanlorin? How? I … Agents, go! I need some more time."
"115740052-0-51991";"How are you resisting this!"
"115740052-0-51992";"I did this for us, Tan. You'll see. This is all for us."
"115740052-0-51993";"I know it fell around here somewhere …."
"115740052-0-51994";"Bright Moons, walker! Who was that?"
"115740052-0-51996";"Break… source nodes… ."
"115740052-0-51997";"We've got to stop meeting like this, Hyacinth."
"115740052-0-51998";"This one warns you, jeek. Screaming nonsense in Rawl'kha will get you caged. Control yourself, or the guard will."
"115740052-0-51999";"I remember. The rite requires moon-sugar water. There should be some in the temple above."
"115740052-0-52000";"Do not worry for me. I would mourn in private for a time."
"115740052-0-52001";"Walker. This one followed your steps and now requires your testimony."
"115740052-0-52002";"Ignore the words of an Inquisitor at your peril, walker. This one found you once. This one will find you again."
"115740052-0-52003";"The cantor is young and prone to distraction. This one would expect nothing less from one faithful to a Daedric Prince. We are finished, walker."
"115740052-0-52004";"These are dangerous words, walker. The Inquisition will need to verify them at once. We will meet again."
"115740052-0-52005";"Silence and mendacity are the seedbed of heresy, walker. This one will have the truth—if not here, then soon. And forcefully."
"115740052-0-52006";"Ah. You return."
"115740052-0-52007";"Mother of Twilight, I beseech you. Guide these souls to your Crossing with dawn's clarity. I seek guidance—"
"115740052-0-52008";"Ziss! Blue flames? How can this be?"
"115740052-0-52009";"F'ah! This once-honorable shrine now serves as a bandit den. I sense the darkness we seek to the east."
"115740052-0-52010";"That dark corner. My moonclaw tells me that is where we need to go."
"115740052-0-52011";"They destroyed a dro-m'Athra! Its soul. It is … gone!"
"115740052-0-52012";"Ravith-morna? It cannot be."
"115740052-0-52013";"She is dro-m'Athra now, a Rajaska! To arms, quickly!"
"115740052-0-52014";"Besha ahnz'ii, rithantii. I am sorry we did not arrive sooner. With your spirit cleansed, Azurah guides you to her Crossing."
"115740052-0-52015";"Noctra, grant me luck. Khenarthi, grant me haste."
"115740052-0-52016";"Seven shadows, it worked! Take care of your high cantor, ja'rithantii. We will see you again soon."
"115740052-0-52017";"Your silence shall soon be permanent!"
"115740052-0-52018";"I'll cut out your lying tongue, heretic!"
"115740052-0-52019";"You gave honest testament. Now face honest deliverance!"
"115740052-0-52020";"You found something?"
"115740052-0-52022";"Ah, my moonclaw is restored! But it bears warning of another incursion. Quickly! We must go."
"115740052-0-52023";"Ziss'vo, this oviit dwelling! What an eyesore!"
"115740052-0-52024";"The young cantor! And the other one."
"115740052-0-52025";"Are you injured, ja'rithantii? Let me tend to your wounds."
"115740052-0-52026";"Viti! You've done enough. Let them help."
"115740052-0-52027";"Hope you don't mind getting your feet wet."
"115740052-0-52028";"The song of the Rajaska. It bends these Twilight Cantors into dro-m'Athra!"
"115740052-0-52029";"Zayabi-morna, my newborn Rajaska, sing for them the next verse."
"115740052-0-52030";"Claws out, my friend! Here we go!"
"115740052-0-52031";"Quickly, everyone. Let us leave this dark place."
"115740052-0-52032";"Let's look around and find Snapdragon."
"115740052-0-52033";"I am sorry, rithantiin. I can cleanse your souls, but I am powerless to stop the corruption before it overtakes you."
"115740052-0-52034";"This the Twilight Cantors can do. Quickly, Viti! Aid me!"
"115740052-0-52035";"When you are ready to hunt the darkness, send for me, my friend."
"115740052-0-52036";"Dhiz maziin! Hello? Ah, ziss'vo."
"115740052-0-52037";"He spoke through our amulets! Soon he'll gather enough strength to come for us!"
"115740052-0-52038";"I took the longer way down, but I am with you now. Let us search these caves."
"115740052-0-52039";"Lich? Heretic? Me? Kes kridesi."
"115740052-0-52040";"Do not touch her, necromancer!"
"115740052-0-52043";"Death seeps up from the catacombs. We must find a way below and locate the cantors."
"115740052-0-52044";"Darkness calls farther in. To the northwest, I think."
"115740052-0-52045";"Through there! My moonclaw senses it. We are close."
"115740052-0-52046";"You're close to the flamequench bloom. I can feel it. Don't stop now!"
"115740052-0-52047";"Detritus can be a horrifying place. The very air is filled with fear. Keep going!"
"115740052-0-52048";"This Haunted needs your help! You must cleanse his weapon!"
"115740052-0-52049";"Mewling, pathetic coward. Only death will cleanse the shame you bring to our House!"
"115740052-0-52050";"Y-you're alive? Get back! I don't want to hurt you. Not again."
"115740052-0-52051";"The blood! The blood … no!"
"115740052-0-52053";"Hyacinth, it doesn't have to be like this. Give me what I need and all this pain will stop."
"115740052-0-52054";"More need to die."
"115740052-0-52055";"I will not fall to you weaklings!"
"115740052-0-52056";"Nearly there!"
"115740052-0-52057";"Caecilius? I'm sorry I failed you."
"115740052-0-52058";"This feeling. Peace at last?"
"115740052-0-52059";"Caecilius? Are you near?"
"115740052-0-52060";"I'm not finished yet!"
"115740052-0-52061";"Alcunar, you know what to do!"
"115740052-0-52062";"I am your emperor!"
"115740052-0-52063";"How are you beating me?"
"115740052-0-52064";"Do you ever leave the training grounds?"
"115740052-0-52065";"I will burn for Orpheon!"
"115740052-0-52066";"I'm sure you will. And Tan? My offer still stands."
"115740052-0-52067";"Ithelia and Vargas have reached the loom's core. We must reach them before they destroy the reality we know."
"115740052-0-52069";"Still as the grave. This does not bode well for our missing cantor."
"115740052-0-52070";"What … what has happened to me?"
"115740052-0-52071";"Our thanks for your testimony. May you find peace in Azurah's embrace."
"115740052-0-52072";"The fire! It's spreading! It's everywhere!"
"115740052-0-52073";"That was one of the Inquisitors. A Rajaska bent his soul."
"115740052-0-52074";"Izalgo's journal? He mentions Ravith-morna. This is troubling. Let us return to Krin'ze at the northwest temple in Redfur."
"115740052-0-52075";"Oh, you have returned. Thank Azurah!"
"115740052-0-52076";"Tamiit, tell her what we found. I need to collect my thoughts."
"115740052-0-52077";"I hoped we would not have to shed light on that chapter of my past."
"115740052-0-52078";"Azurah sent you back for a reason. Could this not be it?"
"115740052-0-52084";"Never watch your past self if you can avoid it, tamiit."
"115740052-0-52085";"This is it. My first meeting with Ravith."
"115740052-0-52086";"Time weaves all around us."
"115740052-0-52087";"And I can tear it asunder!"
"115740052-0-52088";"I exist in all of time!"
"115740052-0-52090";"Kra, look at the size of this place! Is this a training session?"
"115740052-0-52091";"Just so. Years passed, and Ravith and I bonded deeply. With that depth came darkness."
"115740052-0-52092";"It was not advised for rithantii and hadaliit, singer and adept, to share such bonds. We did not listen."
"115740052-0-52093";"As you wish, Ravith. Sing for me!"
"115740052-0-52094";"Grant me the strength to protect him when all others forsake me."
"115740052-0-52096";"Ravith sang. It contained a rhythm, an undertone, we both knew well."
"115740052-0-52097";"Zerith!"
"115740052-0-52098";"The bones … the soul! You destroyed them. They are completely gone! Ravith, what was that song?"
"115740052-0-52099";"I prayed for strength, and it just … came to me. It was meant to protect you."
"115740052-0-52100";"We both heard it, then. The drums of the Bent Dance."
"115740052-0-52101";"This place, it is beautiful!"
"115740052-0-52102";"We stand in the meditation chamber of the Hidden Moon temple, as it was in my youth. Tamiit, you will guide us. Touch the light of memory when you wish to proceed."
"115740052-0-52103";"This is Star Haven Adeptorium! Dark moons, so many dead."
"115740052-0-52104";"Fallen so far and so quickly, I was helpless to stop it. And I was ill-prepared to see to her end."
"115740052-0-52105";"Ravith. She's … fallen to the darkness."
"115740052-0-52106";"I am sorry, Zerith. There is no one else. In Azurah's name, reclaim your blade and end this!"
"115740052-0-52107";"Do not make me kill you, Ravith. Please!"
"115740052-0-52108";"Zerith, you must strike now!"
"115740052-0-52109";"I … I am sorry. Besha ahnz'ii."
"115740052-0-52110";"Shimmerene Rose. Wisteria's favorite. Wait, I can feel her."
"115740052-0-52111";"We have left the memories? Azurah be praised!"
"115740052-0-52112";"I could not witness any more. Talk to Krin'ze, tamiit."
"115740052-0-52113";"An interesting idea, Krin'ze. Talbira rests in the crypts at Rim'kha."
"115740052-0-52114";"Here, Azurah guides our path to those halls. Let us depart."
"115740052-0-52115";"My moonclaw. It senses Daedra and unquiet undead."
"115740052-0-52116";"The tomb is much deeper in, to the east. We will carve a path for you, Krin'ze."
"115740052-0-52117";"Oh—all right. Azurah guide you both."
"115740052-0-52118";"There is the door to the crypt. Now that it is safe, let us send for Krin'ze."
"115740052-0-52119";"No need. I am here."
"115740052-0-52120";"You followed us, ja'rithantii?"
"115740052-0-52121";"The Hidden Moon and the ancient Moon-Singers worked together, yes?"
"115740052-0-52122";"You're a natural! Now pour that on this sheet of paper."
"115740052-0-52123";"If I am to learn their songs, I should walk as they did. Now, shall we enter?"
"115740052-0-52125";"Moon-Singer Talbira. Find her remains, tamiit, and I can invite her forward."
"115740052-0-52126";"Moon-Singer Talbira, I beseech you …. Azurah's light!"
"115740052-0-52127";"My head! Such pain!"
"115740052-0-52128";"What is happening?"
"115740052-0-52129";"A rising darkness. Do you feel it? Oh no … Izalgo?"
"115740052-0-52130";"I will meet you in Rawl'kha, then. Perhaps everything will make more sense once I step out to see the sun …."
"115740052-0-52131";"No! A trap! It's that petrification gas! Take the Emblem to Elfbetta! I … I …"
"115740052-0-52132";"Krin'ze, use this portal. Go! We will deal with Izalgo-morna."
"115740052-0-52133";"Krin'ze safely departed. That is what matters most."
"115740052-0-52134";"Find peace in Azurah's embrace, rithantii."
"115740052-0-52135";"Let us follow Krin'ze through the portal. I sent her to the first safe place I could think of."
"115740052-0-52136";"Thank Azurah! I was about to come after you. I know Talbira's song! I could have helped."
"115740052-0-52137";"Izalgo's soul is at peace. Save your voice for when we face Ravith-morna."
"115740052-0-52138";"Ravith-morna seeks you, Zerith-var!"
"115740052-0-52139";"The work of a voice both great and terrible. Touch the light of memory and you will see."
"115740052-0-52142";"Ravith-morna sends her regards. I bear a dirge for Zerith-var and all who stand beside him."
"115740052-0-52143";"Augh!"
"115740052-0-52144";"Auri-El, they wrecked this place."
"115740052-0-52145";"Blood everywhere. That's not good."
"115740052-0-52147";"We should be able to pick up the trail if we crouch and examine the ground."
"115740052-0-52148";"Thank you for meeting us, ja'rithantii. Tamiit, you know what we seek. Speak while I keep watch."
"115740052-0-52149";"Ja'kh will alert us if you run into any trouble. Be well, singer."
"115740052-0-52151";"The Inquisitors seek to blame Viti for failing to stop the Rajaska? Come. We must hurry to the meeting place southwest of town."
"115740052-0-52152";"Stranger and stranger. What does the message say?"
"115740052-0-52153";"There, the high cantor. Wait. I sense … someone else approaches. Quickly, find a place to hide!"
"115740052-0-52154";"I can endure. We march forward toward … agh."
"115740052-0-52155";"Augh, thank you. Please. The pain is unbearable."
"115740052-0-52156";"Here. Just so you know, it's got a side effect."
"115740052-0-52157";"What side effect?"
"115740052-0-52158";"Show yourself, Inquisitor. Appear and let's be done with this."
"115740052-0-52159";"Bold, high cantor. Few invoke the Inquisition so casually."
"115740052-0-52160";"Grand Inquisitor Arsalan? To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"
"115740052-0-52161";"Come now, Viti. You must have received the summons. Your protege, Krin'ze. She consorts with heretics. Tell me where to find her."
"115740052-0-52162";"I do not keep track of every cantor's comings and goings. Beyond that, I have nothing else to say to the Inquisition!"
"115740052-0-52163";"Very well. I do so enjoy hunting apostates. Your refusal to cooperate will not be forgotten, Viti."
"115740052-0-52164";"He has departed, walker. You might as well come out now."
"115740052-0-52165";"I suppose the two of you would like an explanation."
"115740052-0-52166";"As I said when we met, sister Viti, we are on the same side."
"115740052-0-52167";"Oh, gak."
"115740052-0-52168";"The heretics? Here?"
"115740052-0-52169";"Creatures of darkness seek to strike from the shadows? Two can play at that game. Wait and see."
"115740052-0-52170";"You could not wait until that muskarse had gone?"
"115740052-0-52171";"You knew we were here? Well, you did invite us, high cantor. You wished to speak? Then let us do so."
"115740052-0-52172";"We need not go to Orcrest. I will happily demonstrate my powers here. And once you reveal where to find Ravith-morna, we can end the Rajaska threat."
"115740052-0-52173";"No, hadaliit. It must be Orcrest. For—wait, someone approaches!"
"115740052-0-52175";"Technically I am never not doing something clever. Where are you taking me?"
"115740052-0-52176";"Our insider finally wants to properly introduce themselves. We're headed to Crimson Cove, tinkerer."
"115740052-0-52177";"Let's get out of here. We've got a tinker to save."
"115740052-0-52179";"When do you plan to make amends with your former sahida, high cantor?"
"115740052-0-52180";"Krin'ze? This one hoped you were far from the reach of the Inquisitors. Please, sahida. Let us speak."
"115740052-0-52181";"A promising reunion. Let us give them a moment."
"115740052-0-52182";"Now, if all the talking is done, let us get to Orcrest."
"115740052-0-52183";"You surpassed the need for this one's tutelage long ago, Krin'ze. Viti would be honored for you to teach her Talbira's song."
"115740052-0-52184";"Then we will face these troubles together, as equals. But your guidance will always be appreciated."
"115740052-0-52185";"Our destination lies in the Upper City. A cellar entrance near the town hall. That is our goal."
"115740052-0-52186";"Cantors, remain here. I will open a portal with my moonclaw when we reach the cellar."
"115740052-0-52187";"Well look at this. A wounded Ceythalmor agent. How'd you get hurt?"
"115740052-0-52188";"Let us find a clear space so I can open a portal."
"115740052-0-52189";"This will work. Let me send for our rithantiin."
"115740052-0-52190";"Yes, this is it. Viti remembers these halls. Come, quickly!"
"115740052-0-52191";"Viti, wait! This way, my friends!"
"115740052-0-52192";"Everything is just as it was."
"115740052-0-52193";"Viti! Please. Tell us why you brought us here."
"115740052-0-52194";"Eifa has been dead for some time. Tamiit, aid me in dispelling the darkness that clouds her path. She needs a clear invitation to come forth."
"115740052-0-52195";"Good! Once more."
"115740052-0-52196";"One final time! Eifa, across paths of dawn and dusk, we call to you."
"115740052-0-52197";"Her spirit flows toward the light. She is nearly in reach. Let me—argh!"
"115740052-0-52200";"Heretical prayer, apostasy, and necromantic ritual. I have seen enough."
"115740052-0-52201";"Stand back, cantors! Tamiit, there is no reasoning with him. We must fight!"
"115740052-0-52202";"My Inquisitors reported true. You heretics are powerful."
"115740052-0-52203";"But you face a Grand Inquisitor now. Let us determine who has the stronger faith."
"115740052-0-52204";"No! Did the Grand Inquisitor banish Eifa?"
"115740052-0-52205";"His might was physical, not spiritual. Eifa is near."
"115740052-0-52206";"Eifa forgives Viti. She is at peace. But … there is something else. She has something for you."
"115740052-0-52207";"Twilight's blessings, tamiiti. We must speak."
"115740052-0-52208";"I will sustain the spirit's connection. Tamiit, see what she has to say."
"115740052-0-52209";"This is more dire than I realized. But we know their location and we have Talbira's song. We must act now!"
"115740052-0-52210";"We will search to the east for the entrance to this shrine. Cantors, Ja'kh will stay with you. If he senses danger, I will use the moonclaw to gather you."
"115740052-0-52212";"Ravith-morna. She is here. Beneath us. I sense her presence. Hahl fajh'na, is this really happening?"
"115740052-0-52213";"And prepare yourself, ja'rithantii. You must be ready with Moon-Singer Talbira's song when I call for it."
"115740052-0-52215";"Chorus of the Rajaska-z'har, your dark ritual ends now!"
"115740052-0-52216";"You are early, th'murr. You and your false moon follower cannot be allowed to interfere!"
"115740052-0-52217";"Twin shadows, make prey of these trespassers!"
"115740052-0-52218";"You cannot defeat me, th'murr. Your weapons, your Hidden Moon prayers, they are not strong enough to stop me."
"115740052-0-52219";"Perhaps not by ourselves, but we are not alone."
"115740052-0-52220";"Cantor Krin'ze! The song, now!"
"115740052-0-52221";"Right!"
"115740052-0-52222";"(Anguished scream)"
"115740052-0-52223";"Her resistance is powerful. Tamiit, dispel those wells of darkness!"
"115740052-0-52226";"This song, this power … Moon-Singer Talbira? Is it really you?"
"115740052-0-52227";"Isn't this familiar? Talbira's song. Zerith, ready to strike. Remember what happened next, th'murr?"
"115740052-0-52228";"Do not listen! Dispel the Void energy, tamiit!"
"115740052-0-52229";"Zerith!"
"115740052-0-52230";"Zerith, no!"
"115740052-0-52231";"Focus, Krin'ze! Do not let your song falter!"
"115740052-0-52232";"I opened a portal to Detritus. Enter and seek the flamequench bloom!"
"115740052-0-52233";"Tell me it is not true. Tell me you did not turn your blade on Moon-Singer Talbira?"
"115740052-0-52234";"Travel to Detritus and face this Haunted's fear!"
"115740052-0-52235";"I opened a path. Cleanse the Haunted's axe. But beware. Detritus eventually claims all who enter the realm."
"115740052-0-52236";"Krin'ze … I could not find the words …."
"115740052-0-52237";"Her soul is my soul! Her pain, her betrayal—her hatred! It lives in me!"
"115740052-0-52238";"Krin'ze, hear my voice. Do not let this darkness bend you!"
"115740052-0-52239";"Come with Viti, sister. Let her songs calm your spirit. Tamiiti, do not follow us. Wait to hear from us, yes?"
"115740052-0-52240";"Let us leave this place, tamiit. I have much to confess."
"115740052-0-52241";"I'm sorry! No!"
"115740052-0-52242";"The fires are gone. Finally."
"115740052-0-52243";"My mother … why am I thinking of her?"
"115740052-0-52244";"The blood. It's gone"
"115740052-0-52250";"That's a journal! Let me take a look."
"115740052-0-52251";"I believe we have reached our destination."
"115740052-0-52253";"Mother of Twilight, deliver us this soul lost on the way to your Crossing. Let us return her to you with a heart as new as dawn."
"115740052-0-52255";"This is it. Our forces are gathering at Dusk Keep. It's all moving so quickly."
"115740052-0-52256";"Breathe, woman. You are in control. No one can stop you. Not even Tan and that thorn."
"115740052-0-52257";"All right, Tan. You can do this. Focus. Think of Wisteria. Reach out."
"115740052-0-52258";"I did it again! That was incredible!"
"115740052-0-52260";"This is it. There's no going back. Once we make our move, we succeed or die trying."
"115740052-0-52261";"I promised the world for you, Tanlorin. That starts today with the head of the Proxy Queen."
"115740052-0-52262";"Gardener! Hyacinth! We know Wisteria's plan! And I know how to get to her. But we need your help!"
"115740052-0-52263";"Bogcup? Calm yourself and start from the beginning."
"115740052-0-52266";"No time! I need to focus. My friend can explain everything."
"115740052-0-52267";"Auri-El! Did she just say they're going to kill the Proxy Queen of Alinor?"
"115740052-0-52270";"Everyone think about Wisteria. Strengthen my connection. I'll push out and bridge the space between us."
"115740052-0-52271";"It's working! Friend, reach out with us. Dusk Keep, here we come!"
"115740052-0-52274";"That bottle looks familiar."
"115740052-0-52275";"I must return to Alinor soon. I had hoped Tan would have come to their senses and joined me …."
"115740052-0-52276";"Auri-El! How did I do that? You saw that, too, right?"
"115740052-0-52277";"There, another Eye! Let me try to help strengthen it with a bit of magic."
"115740052-0-52280";"All right, reach out. Let's see what Wisteria was up to."
"115740052-0-52281";"SAT Music"
"115740052-0-52282";"You're the best. Seriously. I was worried I'd be stuck in there until the warm season."
"115740052-0-52283";"Grim totems. Our path to Khenarthi's Rise will not be uncontested. Search in the north, tamiit."
"115740052-0-52284";"You've saved this Haunted, but there are others who need your help."
"115740052-0-52285";"There. Through that break in the rocks."
"115740052-0-52286";"You did well, braving the realm of Detritus. One Haunted still needs your help."
"115740052-0-52288";"Thank Stendarr you made it back!"
"115740052-0-52289";"Moon-Singer Talbira?"
"115740052-0-52290";"Glad you made it, friend. Next, we'll need to find a spot inside to activate the tracker fly."
"115740052-0-52291";"Make way for a new batch of prisoners!"
"115740052-0-52292";"Get down! Don't let the guards see you."
"115740052-0-52293";"Hmm. That's the Albus banner flying over those doors."
"115740052-0-52294";"One of the souls we redeemed in Claw's Strike! Cantor Ta'khida. What is she doing here?"
"115740052-0-52295";"The old sacristy. Could there still be moon-sugar water in these jars?"
"115740052-0-52296";"I'm sorry about your son, Cato. But I can't let you kill anyone else."
"115740052-0-52297";"There's no time for the subtle way. Let's go."
"115740052-0-52298";"They locked the gate. We'll have to find another way through."
"115740052-0-52299";"Why keep you alive?"
"115740052-0-52300";"Who dares interrupt? I cannot avenge my son without these deaths!"
"115740052-0-52301";"I do this for Caecilius. Nobles won't stop this war until they feel the pain of loss!"
"115740052-0-52302";"Caecilius? Oh no. I know why Cato started this."
"115740052-0-52303";"Feel that? We're being magically surveilled."
"115740052-0-52304";"That power … it feels like a monsoon. What magic is Cato gathering in there?"
"115740052-0-52305";"The seal remains intact. This moon-water should still carry Azurah's blessing."
"115740052-0-52306";"Daedra and cultists won't stop us from saving Hyacinth. Let's find that hideout!"
"115740052-0-52307";"Cantor Zayabi? We purified her soul in the Vile Manse. Why does she appear before us?"
"115740052-0-52308";"Cantor Zayabi. Do you remember her from the Vile Manse?"
"115740052-0-52309";"Vandorallen, I should have guessed that was your magic."
"115740052-0-52310";"You think you can stop me? You never succeeded in the Spire."
"115740052-0-52311";"You're murdering kidnapped soldiers!"
"115740052-0-52312";"The war for your precious Empire killed innocents."
"115740052-0-52313";"Why are you even going along with Cato's plan?"
"115740052-0-52314";"Cato's son died under a diplomatic banner. The alliances must end!"
"115740052-0-52315";"Lay them here, tamiit. Let the turned earth receive their remains as Azurah receives their souls."
"115740052-0-52316";"Cantor Ta'khida. We tended to her soul in Claw's Strike."
"115740052-0-52317";"Is that Cantor Izalgo? We tended to his soul in Rimmen Necropolis. He returns? Why?"
"115740052-0-52318";"Cantor Izalgo. We guided him in Rimmen Necropolis."
"115740052-0-52319";"A revelation of forgiveness dawns on Krin'ze. Heed her words now."
"115740052-0-52320";"Hyacinth? Are you in here?"
"115740052-0-52321";"Here, take a look!"
"115740052-0-52322";"This once-proud sanctuary was left to ruin long ago. Bring it to order and your path will be made clear."
"115740052-0-52323";"What do you think? That's a good riddle, right?"
"115740052-0-52324";"We'll return soon, ja'rithantii. May Azurah keep you safe."
"115740052-0-52328";"Is it true? A reeve arrested a mage right in the guildhall?"
"115740052-0-52329";"Blaggards! Enemies of peace! Reprobates!"
"115740052-0-52330";"I was there! Reeve Nardarmor marched right in with armed guards and arrested Lirinisse."
"115740052-0-52331";"Let's separate. You find out where this path goes. I'll investigate that magic."
"115740052-0-52332";"South Beacon, southwest of the lighthouse. And Bogcup, don't stop to feed any monkeys along the way."
"115740052-0-52333";"Mother of twilight, guide your faithful as the unerring arm swings the finely-honed blade. We seek the den of Ravith's Chorus."
"115740052-0-52335";"My moonclaw knows the path. The veil thins at Star Haven Adeptorium, in Northern Elsweyr. I will open our way."
"115740052-0-52336";"Zerith! These flames, what do they mean?"
"115740052-0-52337";"By the moons! Hordes of dro-m'Athra approach. And worse! Through the portal, quickly!"
"115740052-0-52338";"Heh, that Hyacinth. Let's get moving."
"115740052-0-52339";"A humble grave for those that lived humble lives. Sird'tse hatenii, soz rai trajii L'esweyr vabei jezni a tenarr vuskna luvizzna."
"115740052-0-52340";"Focus. I can feel the ship. And there! Hah! Hyacinth, you were right! I am exceptional!"
"115740052-0-52341";"Damned pirates. A plague on every port in Tamriel."
"115740052-0-52342";"Hey, this room looks promising."
"115740052-0-52344";"It would take more than a few rough questions to take me down! The key's right there. Grab it and unlock this cell, please."
"115740052-0-52345";"Good to see you, young one. I assume you also have a plan to get us out of here?"
"115740052-0-52346";"Welcome to my greenhouse, Snapdragon. It pleases me to see that you're safe."
"115740052-0-52349";"They would not try to face the Rajaska alone … oh, no."
"115740052-0-52350";"You cannot restrain me!"
"115740052-0-52351";"Divines curse your actions, Cato. Now your death is meaningless."
"115740052-0-52352";"I will not be restrained!"
"115740052-0-52353";"Father! Not like this. Not anymore."
"115740052-0-52354";"They locked the next door. Hope you don't mind taking a plunge."
"115740052-0-52355";"Stay here, ja'rithantii. Or stay hidden. We will search for the Twilight Cantors."
"115740052-0-52356";"Ziss! You move like a shadow, ja'rithantii."
"115740052-0-52357";"Prepare your voice, Krin'ze. We will need Talbira's song sooner rather than later."
"115740052-0-52358";"Quiet! Someone comes!"
"115740052-0-52359";"A moment to prepare, and then we'll go. Light of love and mercy guide you both."
"115740052-0-52360";"My moonclaw beckons southward, tamiit. Our hunt for Ravith-morna continues."
"115740052-0-52361";"Footsteps! Be ready, cantors."
"115740052-0-52362";"You two novices hear that? Prepare yourselves. We're leaving."
"115740052-0-52363";"Footfalls! The end stalks us!"
"115740052-0-52364";"We gather strength to seek this safe path. Azurah bless you both!"
"115740052-0-52365";"Tamiit, across the bridge. Look at the sky. Mother of Twilight!"
"115740052-0-52366";"Ra'ham. We cannot do this without Krin'ze."
"115740052-0-52367";"I am here. Viti leads the others to a safe place."
"115740052-0-52368";"Your weapons, my voice, and Talbira's song. I am ready to follow you into the darkness."
"115740052-0-52369";"With the guidance of my tamiit, I am finally ready to set things right. Krin'ze … Talbira, if she listens, too …."
"115740052-0-52370";"We do not need your assurances, Zerith-var. We have faith."
"115740052-0-52371";"So you do, ja'rithantii. So you do. Let us step into the portal and end this."
"115740052-0-52380";"Doesn't matter. Stop the executions. I'll free the prisoners."
"115740052-0-52390";"Krin'ze! It must be now!"
"115740052-0-52391";"No! The Mother of All Khajiit will never take me back!"
"115740052-0-52392";"Azurah, let your light drive the darkness from this riven soul. Azurah, lend me strength to guide her back to you. Azurah, by the power of the Hidden Moon, recall Ravith!"
"115740052-0-52393";"Stay strong, Snapdragon! We're going to find you!"
"115740052-0-52394";"Ravith cast off the dark. She seeks redemption!"
"115740052-0-52395";"But the moon beast. We are too late!"
"115740052-0-52396";"You can banish it, tamiiti. The two of you, together, now!"
"115740052-0-52397";"Krin'ze, Ravith, sing! Tamiit, aid me! Let your hand guide mine!"
"115740052-0-52398";"Rise, Hidden Moon!"
"115740052-0-52399";"The wound in my soul closes. At last, I know peace."
"115740052-0-52400";"Cato! It's over. Stop this madness!"
"115740052-0-52401";"I will not rest until the alliance armies burn. They will pay for my son's death!"
"115740052-0-52402";"I'll work on breaking this ward. You take care of the Atronach!"
"115740052-0-52403";"Finally! The ward's down. I'm going after Cato!"
"115740052-0-52404";"What did you find?"
"115740052-0-52407";"You were always the best of us. Bogcup."
"115740052-0-52408";"I can't. Let's go to Southpoint. I need to kill something."
"115740052-0-52417";"Never. It's you and me, Tanlorin. To the very end."
"115740052-0-52418";"Agents to me! The Proxy Queen must die!"
"115740052-0-52419";"Agents, attack! The Dominion must be perfect. Perfect!"
"115740052-0-52420";"I can never stop. Tanlorin!"
"115740052-0-52421";"The outcast Elf thawed out? No matter. I'll put you back on ice."
"115740052-0-52423";"Come to save your little flower? You're welcome to try."
"115740052-0-52444";"You heard the boss! Let's squash this flower."
"115740052-0-52503";"Come now, Zerith. You remember this song."
"115740052-0-52509";"I remember hearing about the diplomatic mission Vandorallen mentioned."
"115740052-0-52511";"Generals from each alliance went to peace talks convinced it was a trap. They killed everyone. Caecilius must have been there."
"115740052-0-52517";"These vaults hold relics stained with dark history. I can smell them."
"115740052-0-52518";"Help! There's an executioner. They blame us for Caecilius's death. We don't know who that is!"
"115740052-0-52531";"Another Twilight Cantor here, did you see? It bodes ill."
"115740052-0-52532";"It bodes worse for that little Dagi. I could hear that older cantor berating her from across the bridge!"
"115740052-0-52533";"Ziss. That is the high cantor, yes? Looking as sour as ever. What is she doing here?"
"115740052-0-52534";"At last, my sahida's presence here makes sense. You lured her here!"
"115740052-0-52535";"This one knows what she senses. An exorcist of my years is not wrong about such things. There is darkness in you, Zerith-var."
"115740052-0-52536";"Let her go, tamiit. We should tell Krin'ze what we found in Goldfolly."
"115740052-0-52556";"And that was how I met Moon-Singer Ravith."
"115740052-0-52557";"Bogcup, you may tell your friend anything and everything. I wholeheartedly approve."
"115740052-0-52559";"He had a duty, but could not see it through. I will not allow the same to happen to me."
"115740052-0-52564";"I get it now. Peace is worth fighting for."
"115740052-0-52568";"Enough! I cannot stand to see this happen again!"
"115740052-0-52569";"Mother's fate waits for father. I am the cause. I can stop it."
"115740052-0-52572";"Come. Find me in the dark."
"115740052-0-52573";"I'll drag your soul into the dark myself!"
"115740052-0-52574";"It's too late!"
"115740052-0-52579";"No! Cantor Izalgo has fallen!"
"115740052-0-52580";"I keep some supplies here for emergencies."
"115740052-0-52582";"Hyacinth made this armor just for me. Said he was bored."
"115740052-0-52583";"There. Now I'm ready to crack some skulls."
"115740052-0-52584";"Let's get out of here. I'll meet you at Rulanyil's Fall!"
"115740052-0-52590";"You'll die here like the rest of these dogs."
"115740052-0-52592";"Ta'khida. Zayabi. The Rajaska-z'har hunts us, high cantor. Who will banish dark spirits if all our kind fall to her song?"
"115740052-0-52593";"Don't say such things, Cer'enza. Do not give in to hopelessness. The high cantor will figure something out."
"115740052-0-52594";"Heart of Lorkhaj, bleed for me!"
"115740052-0-52595";"Mother of Hunger, channel your darkness through me!"
"115740052-0-52596";"Let your souls be the first dragged into the dark."
"115740052-0-52597";"Weep for the bodyguard who failed to protect. It wasn't his fault."
"115740052-0-52598";"Weep for the teacher who taught peace but never stopped fighting."
"115740052-0-52599";"Weep for a mother destroyed by love."
"115740052-0-52600";"I'm fine! I just wanted to catch up. I've missed you."
"115740052-0-52601";"You know I'm right here! I heard every word of that! But no more serious talk. We need some drinks."
"115740052-0-52610";"Master Merric, where are you?"
"115740052-0-52614";"Merric went after the enemy by himself? That spot on the map, it's northwest of here."
"115740052-0-52615";"Merric came this way. You can tell by all the dead bodies. But that armor … it can't be them, can it?"
"115740052-0-52617";"You there, I could use some help!"
"115740052-0-52618";"How about you tell my friend what happened here. Tread carefully, pal."
"115740052-0-52628";"The damn Worm Cult! I knew the armor looked familiar. Get that mistscrub so he'll tell us more."
"115740052-0-52634";"No mention of any Mage Guild arrests. Hmm."
"115740052-0-52635";"Good thought. I was hoping it was the switch to a secret panel, too."
"115740052-0-52637";"I can't believe they did this."
"115740052-0-52638";"The ritual chamber lies to the west, tamiit. I will guard our tails."
"115740052-0-52639";"Come! We can hold them off no longer!"
"115740052-0-52640";"Thank you for banking with the Foundation of Trust. Have a good day."
"115740052-0-52643";"And Azurah said, I must send you into the dark. She gave to me the Moon to wield, and it became a weapon such that the dark could trouble me no longer."
"115740052-0-52644";"The light of twin moons against the Darkness Behind the World. We must be enough."
"115740052-0-52645";"Krin'ze! You are safe!"
"115740052-0-52646";"We did it, Viti! Let me tell you everything."
"115740052-0-52648";"It's like with the boat and the disk. It's like she's right here. If I just …."
"115740052-0-52654";"They're already here. Merric arrived before you and the prince. He ran down to help."
"115740052-0-52657";"Gabrielle, Azah! The Worm Cult is going to attack the Mages Guild!"
"115740052-0-52658";"The attack's begun and Merric ran down there? Damn! Tell Gabrielle what we learned, but be quick about it!"
"115740052-0-52659";"That's Wisteria's handwriting. Hang on to that."
"115740052-0-52662";"Another bottle of Shimmerene Rose. Wisteria was here."
"115740052-0-52663";"Merric went after the enemy by himself? That spot on the map, it's north of here."
"115740052-0-52664";"A dead mortal's appearance is no good to me. Come. We're done here."
"115740052-0-52665";"By the gods! Merric!"
"115740052-0-52666";"Merric's … dead. By the swords of my forefathers, I will make the Worm Cult pay."
"115740052-0-52667";"I came as quick as—oh, no. Merric. The magisters. What happened?"
"115740052-0-52668";"Merric destroyed the Worm Cult device. It exploded and killed him."
"115740052-0-52672";"It's over. She's dead."
"115740052-0-52673";"Your loot or your life… On second thought, I'll have them both."
"115740052-0-52674";"Get over here, you mug! This one's putting up a fight!"
"115740052-0-52675";"Hey, get off your butt and make with the killing!"
"115740052-0-52676";"Gardener, I understand what you're doing. But I think my time with the Garland Ring has come to an end. It's been an honor."
"115740052-0-52677";"Tanlorin, the honor was all mine. Of course, you should do what you think is right for you. I wish you only the best."
"115740052-0-52678";"Do not forget us, Tanlorin. Though I suppose that is highly unlikely. I am quite memorable. Do come visit when you can."
"115740052-0-52679";"Oh I will. I'll still drag you out to get drinks every now and then, Hyacinth. Thank you. Both of you."
"115740052-0-52681";"How many foes …."
"115740052-0-52682";"… Can you weather?"
"115740052-0-52684";"The door to the underground chambers is right over there. Be careful!"
"115740052-0-52685";"Go, comrade. We need to help the guildmaster!"
"115740052-0-52687";"Use the nearby doors to leave. When you assault the Worm Nest, the Mages Guild will join you. You have my word."
"115740052-0-52689";"As the guilds first defeated the Worm Cult, so shall we do so again. But that device. A Daedra named Mezamma called it a soul reaper."
"115740052-0-52691";"Look for me outside after you talk to the magister. I have a few more thoughts I want to share with this worm."
"115740052-0-52696";"She's here, I can feel it."
"115740052-0-52712";"Just like at our guildhalls. No obvious sign of forced entry, yet clear signs of battle."
"115740052-0-52713";"Eifa. This one is so sorry she wasn't there. And for what she did. This one lacked the strength to guide your spirit out of darkness. This one failed you."
"115740052-0-52714";"It seems you have the strength now. Forgive yourself, little sister, as I forgive you."
"115740052-0-52717";"Hyacinth! Look, we're alive!"
"115740052-0-52720";"Excellent. They can be destroyed without triggering a fatal explosion."
"115740052-0-52725";"Damn worms don't make finding their nest easy."
"115740052-0-52726";"Keep looking. The nest must be here somewhere."
"115740052-0-52727";"Ah, the nest entrance! Let's head inside."
"115740052-0-52728";"I suggest we split our forces. We'll draw less attention and hurry our search for Mezamma."
"115740052-0-52729";"Good call. We'll go west. You and our friend head north."
"115740052-0-52730";"Too late! She has escaped!"
"115740052-0-52733";"I sense illusion magic beyond the crumbled wall. Find the source."
"115740052-0-52734";"Yes, there's something here. I'll dispel the illusion."
"115740052-0-52740";"Ah! A means to deactivate the soul reapers. But, where do they funnel souls to? Let's keep searching."
"115740052-0-52741";"Look, past the gate. Captives from the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-52742";"The device siphoned their souls! A horrid death. We must destroy that soul reaper."
"115740052-0-52743";"Resist if you want. We take your soul either way."
"115740052-0-52746";"Destroy that abomination! Tear out its core as the journal described."
"115740052-0-52748";"The illusion is behind that altar. Along the wall."
"115740052-0-52749";"What can we learn from this scroll?"
"115740052-0-52750";"A singular focus on the destruction of every living being. They must be stopped. Our search continues."
"115740052-0-52751";"By the Stars! So many reapers. They could blanket all of Tamriel."
"115740052-0-52753";"A hidden journal? Intriguing. What does it say?"
"115740052-0-52762";"Be patient? While we stand in this cavern, Orpheon's army destroys everything we hold dear!"
"115740052-0-52763";"If you think you can fight through the army, take our new friends. But keep Sister Chana safe."
"115740052-0-52767";"That's definitely the arch from the sketch! Let's look around."
"115740052-0-52772";"I don't think this is the right place. Let's keep looking."
"115740052-0-52784";"Oh no. Oleander."
"115740052-0-52786";"I sing for my Mistress of Decay!"
"115740052-0-52795";"We'll take a passage and meet up with you later. Sister Chana, help me with these survivors."
"115740052-0-52797";"The Fighters Guild contingent—all dead! Wait, I recognize that sword. It's Skordo's."
"115740052-0-52815";"Let me take a look at that sword."
"115740052-0-52820";"He's the dog who sniffed our island out. The tracker who led Orpheon's army here."
"115740052-0-52826";"Khafdeed says Garvin removed the ladder. Use this portal."
"115740052-0-52828";"No ambush? Onsi cloaks us from our enemies."
"115740052-0-52829";"You'll never read this scroll!"
"115740052-0-52830";"Is it over? Is the scroll safe?"
"115740052-0-52834";"Worm Cult bastards ambushed us. Come help me, pal."
"115740052-0-52835";"Skordo! You're injured!"
"115740052-0-52836";"The Great Mage does not fall easily."
"115740052-0-52837";"No, Vanus! I'm over here! That's not me!"
"115740052-0-52838";"Arrogant mage. My master demands your presence."
"115740052-0-52839";"You can't have him, creature!"
"115740052-0-52840";"First the Mages' head. Next the Fighters' heart."
"115740052-0-52841";"Vanus is … gone. Mezamma took him."
"115740052-0-52842";"Yeah. Let's figure this out, pal."
"115740052-0-52849";"I think I can bring this barrier down."
"115740052-0-52850";"Focus, Tan. Just like before. Reach out."
"115740052-0-52851";"Their ritual, it's still active!"
"115740052-0-52854";"There, up top. That banner again. This must be the Ceythalmor base."
"115740052-0-52855";"Perfect. All we need is a few petals."
"115740052-0-52856";"Nothing but ash now. Damn them."
"115740052-0-52857";"Snapdragon's magic did this. It happened quite recently."
"115740052-0-52860";"A Ceythalmor dagger."
"115740052-0-52861";"I sense no ill will ahead. These remains are undisturbed, thank Azurah."
"115740052-0-52862";"How do you feel about a portal, Gabrielle?"
"115740052-0-52865";"Of course. One portal to Shornhelm's Mages Guild coming up."
"115740052-0-52866";"No apologies, Skordo. We'll get Vanus back."
"115740052-0-52868";"About Vanus …."
"115740052-0-52869";"The Antiquarian Circle knows many secrets, Skordo. Now go. You have your mission and we have ours."
"115740052-0-52870";"Right. Come on, pal, through the portal!"
"115740052-0-52871";"All right, Bogcup. What would you have us do?"
"115740052-0-52872";"Wait, did the gryphon just leave?"
"115740052-0-52873";"Let it go. We have to split up. Outmaneuver our enemy and flank Orpheon at the scroll room."
"115740052-0-52874";"There's something familiar about his magic. I can help."
"115740052-0-52875";"Help from up here. I can protect you from attacks or uneven terrain. Not both."
"115740052-0-52876";"Mauloch's jawbone! The attack's aleady begun!"
"115740052-0-52877";"Let's talk before we rush in blindly."
"115740052-0-52879";"Well done, friend! You made Mezamma pay for Merric and all the death she caused."
"115740052-0-52881";"I will take my own path to the Elder Scroll and protect it until you arrive. Now, come here, Khafdeed."
"115740052-0-52882";"I left the alliance ambassadors alone on Stirk with Prince Azah. Let's go try to convince them."
"115740052-0-52889";"Hey! Is that you, Bogcup? Find a key and get me out of here!"
"115740052-0-52900";"Here, this portal will get you to Shornhelm. I'll see you there."
"115740052-0-52907";"This is beautiful. Gardener? Hello?"
"115740052-0-52912";"Those attacks in Auridon? Prince Azah says it's the Worm Cult!"
"115740052-0-52913";"Prince Azah said Gabrielle was bringing the hero who uncovered this plot. Let's hear them out."
"115740052-0-52914";"What does it matter? We can't fight wars in both Cyrodiil and our sovereign territory!"
"115740052-0-52915";"Come on! Time to get justice for Merric and the guilds."
"115740052-0-52916";"Vanus's staff! It's reacting to you, friend!"
"115740052-0-52917";"Reach out and see what happens."
"115740052-0-52918";"Listen, everyone! My time is short."
"115740052-0-52919";"You must hear what I have to say. Let us speak!"
"115740052-0-52920";"There's no time to waste, comrade. Come, let us speak."
"115740052-0-52928";"It's clear now. We need to work together if we're to have any hope of defeating the Worm Cult"
"115740052-0-52929";"Agreed. We must report back to our superiors and rally our forces."
"115740052-0-52930";"And what shall we call this newfound camaraderie?"
"115740052-0-52931";"How about the Stirk Fellowship? This island has a habit of being part of these things."
"115740052-0-52939";"Hmph."
"115740052-0-52940";"Sister Chana, take us to the walkway. Now!"
"115740052-0-52941";"We'll continue from the high ground. It's too dangerous down there."
"115740052-0-52974";"Cantor Zayabi. With your spirit cleansed, Azurah guides you to her Crossing. Find peace in her embrace."
"115740052-0-52990";"No! Not when we're so close! We march forward toward perfection!"
"115740052-0-52991";"Wisteria, stop! Don't do this!"
"115740052-0-52992";"We appreciate your aid, but will someone please tell us what in Oblivion is going on?"
"115740052-0-52993";"Yes. I can see that. I presume everything turned out well?"
"115740052-0-53020";"We saw Mentor Huzbedad's body."
"115740052-0-53021";"Khafdeed, what do we do now?"
"115740052-0-53054";"No one is supposed to be here!"
"115740052-0-53167";"I won, mortal. I shattered your guilds. Killed or captured your leaders. The Order of the Black Worm is victorious!"
"115740052-0-53169";"Gaze into my eyes. Succumb to my illusions!"
"115740052-0-53170";"Annoying mortal! Destroying me won't stop our master's plan!"
"115740052-0-53173";"Caught you!"
"115740052-0-53184";"Taste dirt!"
"115740052-0-53198";"Hey, the prince sent you? Let's talk."
"115740052-0-53199";"That camp looks promising. See what those papers are all about."
"115740052-0-53204";"Merric went after the enemy by himself? That spot on the map, it's northwest of here."
"115740052-0-53207";"Let's get those leaves back to that cultist scum. And he better not have died before I get to kill him!"
"115740052-0-53227";"Leave him. Let's go over what we know."
"115740052-0-53247";"Did you find the magister, pal?"
"115740052-0-53255";"Look, across the chasm! Guildmaster Merric! The Worm Cult has him!"
"115740052-0-53256";"No, Merric can't be dead. We need to reach him!"
"115740052-0-53270";"Stop, mortal! The soul reaper is not yet stable!"
"115740052-0-53286";"Take cover! Siege Master Malthoras is aiming this way!"
"115740052-0-53298";"She's dragging Vanus into a portal!"
"115740052-0-53314";"Prince Azah, the guildhall's on high alert. I was about to lead a contingent of fighters to the Mages Guild."
"115740052-0-53315";"The battle's over, Skordo. Guildmaster Merric is … dead."
"115740052-0-53316";"What? Not Merric! Hey pal, tell me what happened."
"115740052-0-53318";"Stendarr, please. Merric can't be dead. He just can't."
"115740052-0-53321";"Welcome, Vanus. We're glad to be working alongside you and your guild again."
"115740052-0-53333";"There's no time for niceties, Azah. You there, come speak to me."
"115740052-0-53335";"She set everything on fire. How are we still here right now?"
"115740052-0-53345";"Alcunar!"
"115740052-0-53346";"We have some work to do."
"115740052-0-53347";"Your actions perpetuate war and suffering. You're the villains here!"
"115740052-0-53348";"Orpheon will bring peace. Accept that and cease your efforts!"
"115740052-0-53349";"You think you can stop me? When I already proved my might?"
"115740052-0-53350";"One more fight and then the scroll is mine."
"115740052-0-53354";"The Mages Guild built all this under Shornhelm? I wonder if the people know what lies beneath their feet."
"115740052-0-53364";"Did you explain the stakes? We need the Three Alliances to cooperate."
"115740052-0-53365";"We got them to come to Stirk. That's a start. Now we just need to make them see reason."
"115740052-0-53371";"Tell me what happened. Where's Vanus?"
"115740052-0-53372";"I'll let our friend fill you in. I need to think."
"115740052-0-53376";"I can open a portal to the Earth Forge. Then Prince Azah and I have our own task to attend to."
"115740052-0-53377";"We do? What can be more important than defending the Earth Forge and stopping Mezamma?"
"115740052-0-53378";"Enough reapers to cover all of Tamriel? We need to convince the alliances to join with the guilds. Just like last time."
"115740052-0-53379";"Good luck with that! It took Vanus to get the alliance leaders to work together last time. Wait, you know where the Earth Forge is?"
"115740052-0-53385";"Orpheon is in the scroll room!"
"115740052-0-53447";"That trap on the ground looks familiar. Check it out."
"115740052-0-53448";"Yup, that's one of Merric's, all right. Uses them when he's too busy to stop at a proper inn. Let's keep going."
"115740052-0-53503";"Hey, the prince sent you? Let's talk."
"115740052-0-53504";"Hey, the prince sent you? Let's talk."
"115740052-0-53513";"I appreciate the Fighters Guild coming to our aid, Prince Azah."
"115740052-0-53526";"The leader of the Mages Guild? His assistance could be crucial to destroying the Worm Nest!"
"115740052-0-53533";"Let my mentor go, foul creature!"
"115740052-0-53534";"By the black Void, this hurts. Do you have mistscrub leaves?"
"115740052-0-53544";"That explosion. Stendarr preserve him, Merric was caught in the blast!"
"115740052-0-53565";"I'll take Vanus's staff. It may behave strangely in untrained hands."
"115740052-0-53566";"All yours. Now let's get out of here."
"115740052-0-53567";"And it looks like the worms didn't get all of my guildmates. That's something, at least."
"115740052-0-53568";"Let's look for Guildmaster Merric, but be ready to take down any cultists you see."
"115740052-0-53569";"Did you feel that? Hurry! Through those doors ahead!"
"115740052-0-53570";"I'm sure I speak for my fellow diplomats when I say we will pass on the information but can make no promises."
"115740052-0-53571";"Vanus!"
"115740052-0-53644";"Comrade, please. Search the area and gather Guildmaster Merric's weapons."
"115740052-0-53646";"You found something? Let me see."
"115740052-0-53647";"I'll teleport the remains of that horrid device upstairs for study."
"115740052-0-53649";"Pardon the interruption. Vanus Galerion would like to talk to you. He's right outside."
"115740052-0-53651";"The Fighters Guild requires leadership. I suggest Prince Azah take command until your council can select a new guildmaster."
"115740052-0-53653";"As much as I want to be there with you, I see the wisdom in Vanus's words. I'll stay behind to command the guild."
"115740052-0-53664";"As you wish, Mezamma."
"115740052-0-53717";"Take my horse, Wimi. She'll get you to the site quickly. I'll send word so the scout meets you there."
"115740052-0-53719";"You should rest, Magister Andrelo. That incident has you all out of sorts."
"115740052-0-53775";"That was his father's sword. Merric wielded it proudly."
"115740052-0-53776";"Merric would polish that shield for hours. It was almost a ritual for him."
"115740052-0-53777";"Soul reaper, hmm? We'll study it and determine its exact purpose."
"115740052-0-53778";"Gabrielle … can you help me take care of Guildmaster Merric?"
"115740052-0-53779";"Of course, Prince Azah."
"115740052-0-53796";"If even the great Vanus Galerion is worried about this threat … we have to act. Now."
"115740052-0-53806";"Merric! No!"
"115740052-0-53839";"I … I am sorry. Besha ahnz'ii."
"115740052-0-53840";"Zerith, you must strike now!"
"115740052-0-53855";"Guildmaster Merric is really dead, Skordo. I … I don't know how we're going to stop the Worm Cult without him."
"115740052-0-53856";"How deep have these disgusting worms burrowed?"
"115740052-0-53857";"Protect the staff!"
"115740052-0-53881";"Comrade, Skordo, I came as soon as I received your message."
"115740052-0-53922";"He's right, Azah. And you know the rest of the guild is more likely to follow you than they are me."
"115740052-0-53949";"More soul reapers! Destroy them!"
"115740052-0-53950";"Damn worms! It's an infestation!"
"115740052-0-53951";"Faster, pal! As long as Mezamma's pretending to be me, my guildmates are dying."
"115740052-0-53952";"Ugh! I don't remember these corridors being so dismal!"
"115740052-0-53953";"There! That's me! I mean, not me—Mezamma! Get her!"
"115740052-0-53955";"Ambassadors, please! You must listen!"
"115740052-0-53956";"You destroyed it and we're not dead! Good job! Let's keep going!"
"115740052-0-53963";"Alcunar! Tear into them!"
"115740052-0-54136";"This is a music SAT"
"115740052-0-54143";"This is a music SAT"
"115740052-0-54147";"This is a music SAT"
