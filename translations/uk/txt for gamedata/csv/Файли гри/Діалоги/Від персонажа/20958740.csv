"20958740-0-4199";"I'll free you."
"20958740-0-4206";"<Continue the examination.>"
"20958740-0-4207";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4208";"What would you have me do?"
"20958740-0-4209";"What would you have me do?"
"20958740-0-4211";"What was she looking for?"
"20958740-0-4214";"Are you asking me to steal some wine?"
"20958740-0-4216";"Okay, how does that help?"
"20958740-0-4218";"Are you asking me to steal some wine for you?"
"20958740-0-4219";"So you want someone to take this control rod to her."
"20958740-0-4224";"Is that sort of thing normal in <<1>>?"
"20958740-0-4228";"What did Tanval Indoril do?"
"20958740-0-4229";"We must discuss an urgent matter."
"20958740-0-4230";"If I can do it, I will."
"20958740-0-4234";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4238";"Can I help?"
"20958740-0-4239";"Accept"
"20958740-0-4241";"Take your time."
"20958740-0-4247";"Where do I come in?"
"20958740-0-4249";"Can they be stopped?"
"20958740-0-4252";"So we're going to join him?"
"20958740-0-4253";"I wonder where this came from?"
"20958740-0-4255";"You're after the pirates' treasure?"
"20958740-0-4256";"Why is that a good thing?"
"20958740-0-4257";"If it affects them like it affected <<1>>, I wouldn't be surprised."
"20958740-0-4259";"What are you after? Their loot?"
"20958740-0-4267";"Not even the faintest clue."
"20958740-0-4270";"I wasn't sent by anyone, but I might be willing to help."
"20958740-0-4271";"I can use the decanter to extinguish the fire."
"20958740-0-4273";"What have they decided?"
"20958740-0-4276";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4279";"What do you know about his disappearance?"
"20958740-0-4280";"What's so special about these students?"
"20958740-0-4281";"Where can I get these things?"
"20958740-0-4282";"I'll get the tree-minder's help."
"20958740-0-4284";"<Accept the Contract>"
"20958740-0-4285";"What should we do?"
"20958740-0-4290";"Who is she?"
"20958740-0-4292";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4295";"Wait here. I'll be back."
"20958740-0-4296";"Tell me what happened."
"20958740-0-4297";"And if I refuse?"
"20958740-0-4298";"Where is this?"
"20958740-0-4299";"Do you need any help, Nojaxia?"
"20958740-0-4302";"Maybe if I read it?"
"20958740-0-4303";"How do we get them out?"
"20958740-0-4304";"I'll try. Do you know where the Reachmen leaders are?"
"20958740-0-4305";"I'll get you out. Is anyone else down here?"
"20958740-0-4307";"They seem to be gone now. Was there anyone else here?"
"20958740-0-4308";"What happened?"
"20958740-0-4309";"There's a library on the island. This book must belong there."
"20958740-0-4311";"What needs to be done?"
"20958740-0-4313";"I should take this to <<1>> in <<2>>."
"20958740-0-4314";"The cult? In Skyrim?"
"20958740-0-4315";"Calm down. Is anyone else down here?"
"20958740-0-4316";"I'll get you out. Is anyone else down here?"
"20958740-0-4317";"I won't. Is anyone else down here?"
"20958740-0-4318";"That sounds bad."
"20958740-0-4320";"Fire lizards? You mean Daedra?"
"20958740-0-4321";"Shards?"
"20958740-0-4322";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4323";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4326";"How do we do that?"
"20958740-0-4327";"You want me to untie you?"
"20958740-0-4328";"We'll talk more later. Now go!"
"20958740-0-4329";"Do you need help?"
"20958740-0-4332";"Right. Got it."
"20958740-0-4333";"Not a chance. I might get in trouble."
"20958740-0-4334";"I could probably just untie you…"
"20958740-0-4335";"So a Khajit cursed you to, what, always be kidnapped?"
"20958740-0-4336";"I'll have you free in a moment."
"20958740-0-4338";"This is his last day!"
"20958740-0-4339";"I will do so."
"20958740-0-4340";"Really? More murder?"
"20958740-0-4341";"If it ends the Dreamers' tyranny, I'll kill Remelie for you."
"20958740-0-4342";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4343";"What should be done?"
"20958740-0-4344";"Oh?"
"20958740-0-4345";"So you forgive him, right?"
"20958740-0-4346";"Valaste, are you all right?"
"20958740-0-4349";"I'll go speak to her."
"20958740-0-4350";"Why would I go there?"
"20958740-0-4351";"I'll find him."
"20958740-0-4352";"What can I do for you, Bragur?"
"20958740-0-4353";"There are more of these Maulborn?"
"20958740-0-4354";"What can I do for you, Bragur?"
"20958740-0-4355";"Aye."
"20958740-0-4357";"Just tell me what you want done."
"20958740-0-4359";"I'll lend what aid I can."
"20958740-0-4360";"Where's your well? I'll start with the fires."
"20958740-0-4362";"Valuable?"
"20958740-0-4364";"<Remove the sword.>"
"20958740-0-4365";"Then I'll head east."
"20958740-0-4366";"Why's that lucky?"
"20958740-0-4373";"Where can I find her?"
"20958740-0-4375";"I can find these relics."
"20958740-0-4378";"Where can I find her?"
"20958740-0-4379";"Where do we start?"
"20958740-0-4382";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-0-4383";"I could help recover the bodies."
"20958740-0-4384";"And he needs help?"
"20958740-0-4385";"What is the Worm Cult doing here?"
"20958740-0-4387";"They would have just captured you too."
"20958740-0-4388";"I will go to Taarengrav right away then."
"20958740-0-4390";"I've heard Ulrich died."
"20958740-0-4391";"If I can find him, I'll get him for you."
"20958740-0-4392";"Are you supposed to be?"
"20958740-0-4393";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4394";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-4395";"So what now?"
"20958740-0-4397";"If she hasn't been found yet, how will we locate her?"
"20958740-0-4398";"Are you sure we can make our way through?"
"20958740-0-4399";"Speak to his spirit, you mean?"
"20958740-0-4400";"What then?"
"20958740-0-4402";"Who is this Frozen Man?"
"20958740-0-4404";"I have to stop some local bandits. I'll burn their supplies and rescue their prisoners."
"20958740-0-4405";"You need to rest."
"20958740-0-4406";"I'll find your dog. And your husband, if I can."
"20958740-0-4413";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4415";"Where are you going to be?"
"20958740-0-4429";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4430";"Any idea where I should begin?"
"20958740-0-4432";"I'll find as many as I can."
"20958740-0-4433";"I'll find as many as I can."
"20958740-0-4434";"I'll find as many as I can."
"20958740-0-4435";"I'll find as many as I can."
"20958740-0-4442";"Why would the giants attack Lower Yorgrim?"
"20958740-0-4446";"Where is Damar now?"
"20958740-0-4447";"I'll find them, <<1>>."
"20958740-0-4448";"Where are you headed?"
"20958740-0-4449";"So … your guar herd is your family?"
"20958740-0-4461";"I'm willing, Darj."
"20958740-0-4466";"Have you gone to look for them?"
"20958740-0-4467";"I'll get them out."
"20958740-0-4468";"I'll find them, <<1>>."
"20958740-0-4469";"I'll find them, <<1>>."
"20958740-0-4470";"I'll find them, <<1>>."
"20958740-0-4477";"You want to attack the Covenant with netch?"
"20958740-0-4478";"That's terrible!"
"20958740-0-4480";"I can help with that."
"20958740-0-4483";"Should I go to the fort?"
"20958740-0-4486";"There must be something I can do."
"20958740-0-4494";"I'll see to it."
"20958740-0-4501";"I'll talk to Holgunn."
"20958740-0-4502";"I'll talk to Holgunn."
"20958740-0-4503";"I'll see to Barasatii."
"20958740-0-4504";"What can I do?"
"20958740-0-4506";"Is there anything I can do?"
"20958740-0-4507";"Is there anything I can do for him?"
"20958740-0-4508";"Maybe we can talk to her."
"20958740-0-4509";"Ebonheart Pact delegates are here?"
"20958740-0-4510";"What's wrong?"
"20958740-0-4511";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-4512";"I'll find the assassins."
"20958740-0-4514";"What does Fildgor want?"
"20958740-0-4517";"Who attacked the fort?"
"20958740-0-4518";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4522";"But it's gone now."
"20958740-0-4523";"I can try to find her."
"20958740-0-4525";"I'll see to it."
"20958740-0-4527";"What can I do about it?"
"20958740-0-4528";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4529";"I could do that."
"20958740-0-4530";"Thank you, soldier."
"20958740-0-4531";"Thank you, soldier."
"20958740-0-4532";"I'll get them out."
"20958740-0-4534";"Always ready to kill Goblins."
"20958740-0-4535";"These relics were in the box with Halskar's orders."
"20958740-0-4536";"I'll find Prince Irnskar."
"20958740-0-4537";"Who stole it?"
"20958740-0-4538";"I'll see to it."
"20958740-0-4539";"What monsters?"
"20958740-0-4540";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4541";"That sounds bad, what can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4542";"I can talk to the thanes."
"20958740-0-4544";"What would I need to do?"
"20958740-0-4545";"How do you appease the Bad Man?"
"20958740-0-4546";"Consider it done."
"20958740-0-4548";"I'll do it, give me a second."
"20958740-0-4549";"What are you talking about?"
"20958740-0-4550";"Why did Fildgor take control of Skuldafn?"
"20958740-0-4551";"What does a story being wrong matter?"
"20958740-0-4552";"What do you need?"
"20958740-0-4557";"What's a spinner doing at a burial site?"
"20958740-0-4561";"Then what?"
"20958740-0-4563";"A celebration? That sounds like fun."
"20958740-0-4566";"What do you need?"
"20958740-0-4567";"What's a spinner doing at a burial site?"
"20958740-0-4572";"Is she hurt?"
"20958740-0-4575";"Need any help?"
"20958740-0-4576";"That sounds kind of difficult."
"20958740-0-4578";"How so?"
"20958740-0-4579";"I can help you."
"20958740-0-4580";"The shrine of the Green Lady?"
"20958740-0-4582";"Where did they tunnel in?"
"20958740-0-4584";"A celebration? That sounds like fun."
"20958740-0-4587";"Where are your ""boys?"""
"20958740-0-4588";"Almost positive?"
"20958740-0-4591";"Are you saying King Jorunn is dead?"
"20958740-0-4592";"I'll meet up with Thane Mera."
"20958740-0-4593";"How do I get into Sovngarde?"
"20958740-0-4594";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4596";"We? Where are the other defenders?"
"20958740-0-4599";"How will I know which aspect to choose?"
"20958740-0-4600";"Is anyone still back there?"
"20958740-0-4601";"Is anyone still at the farm?"
"20958740-0-4602";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4604";"Maybe I can help."
"20958740-0-4606";"Does Magister Osanne know about the mystery metal?"
"20958740-0-4607";"Who else survived?"
"20958740-0-4608";"I'll head there now."
"20958740-0-4609";"Sure. I can help."
"20958740-0-4611";"Can I release them somehow?"
"20958740-0-4612";"I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
"20958740-0-4613";"Maybe I can help. What do you need?"
"20958740-0-4614";"What did she say happened?"
"20958740-0-4616";"I wondered about that."
"20958740-0-4618";"What's that?"
"20958740-0-4619";"Fallowstone Hall?"
"20958740-0-4620";"Do you want me to take the ore to Fort Amol?"
"20958740-0-4621";"Sounds like it's going to be quite a battle."
"20958740-0-4622";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4623";"Do you think more troops will come?"
"20958740-0-4624";"The Hound?"
"20958740-0-4625";"What happened to you?"
"20958740-0-4626";"Vile? What is it?"
"20958740-0-4627";"They'll let us through, or we'll find a way around!"
"20958740-0-4628";"Why did the cult attack a ruin?"
"20958740-0-4631";"They must be meeting about something important."
"20958740-0-4632";"What do you mean?"
"20958740-0-4633";"Do you need help?"
"20958740-0-4634";"You may not like what I find."
"20958740-0-4635";"I'm going?"
"20958740-0-4638";"You think they still have her."
"20958740-0-4639";"You speak?"
"20958740-0-4640";"Did the thane survive?"
"20958740-0-4644";"I'll meet him there."
"20958740-0-4645";"I'll find him."
"20958740-0-4646";"Who commands this fort?"
"20958740-0-4648";"So you're trying to write down a story?"
"20958740-0-4652";"What about Wuuthrad?"
"20958740-0-4653";"Why can't Stormhold's guard find the murderer?"
"20958740-0-4654";"What are the cultists doing?"
"20958740-0-4655";"I think I can figure it out. What needs doing?"
"20958740-0-4658";"Have you reported him to the thane's guard?"
"20958740-0-4664";"Thank you. Where can I find him?"
"20958740-0-4667";"What does she need to do?"
"20958740-0-4673";"Just tell me what I need to do."
"20958740-0-4674";"What's your plan?"

"20958740-0-4677";"The King has gone to Fort Amol?"
"20958740-0-4678";"Maybe they'll come back on their own."
"20958740-0-4681";"Is there someone I should find inside?"
"20958740-0-4684";"I'll find Captain Alhana."
"20958740-0-4693";"I will. Where is she?"
"20958740-0-4694";"Where did King Jorunn go?"
"20958740-0-4695";"Thank you. Where can I find her?"
"20958740-0-4696";"Since you asked, spirit."
"20958740-0-4697";"What kind of gathering?"
"20958740-0-4698";"What do you want me to do?"
"20958740-0-4700";"Then how can we defeat them?"
"20958740-0-4701";"<Collect any amulets I see.>"
"20958740-0-4702";"What would you have me do?"
"20958740-0-4713";"Why did they slaughter the Voljars?"
"20958740-0-4715";"Why don't you strike first, then?"
"20958740-0-4716";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-4717";"So we'll drug the rest of the mercenaries?"
"20958740-0-4718";"All right. I'll find him."
"20958740-0-4719";"Fildgor's launching multiple attacks?"

"20958740-0-4734";"What can I do for you, Bragur?"
"20958740-0-4738";"Is the Queen in any danger?"
"20958740-0-4739";"A few rabbits in one minute, or one specific rabbit and I win?"
"20958740-0-4740";"Those wounds look bad."
"20958740-0-4741";"Some people are missing?"
"20958740-0-4742";"Perhaps. What do I have to do?"
"20958740-0-4743";"Thank you, I'll speak to Telenger, then."
"20958740-0-4744";"The manor?"
"20958740-0-4746";"Normally?"
"20958740-0-4748";"It certainly doesn't look natural."

"20958740-0-4755";"Where did they take it?"
"20958740-0-4756";"The cultists attacked you? Or the mammoths?"
"20958740-0-4757";"Help you how?"
"20958740-0-4759";"I'll see if I can find her."
"20958740-0-4762";"The cult? Here?"
"20958740-0-4763";"The cult? Here?"
"20958740-0-4764";"What needs to be done?"
"20958740-0-4767";"Where would she go?"
"20958740-0-4774";"Then my place is at your side."
"20958740-0-4775";"But they're dead, right?"
"20958740-0-4776";"You want me to find him?"
"20958740-0-4782";"And you want me to destroy it?"
"20958740-0-4783";"I'll gather more kindling. Hang on."
"20958740-0-4785";"What can I do about it?"
"20958740-0-4786";"Who betrayed you?"
"20958740-0-4787";"Any idea where they might have taken them?"
"20958740-0-4788";"Sure."
"20958740-0-4789";"I just might. Thanks."
"20958740-0-4790";"Will do, Daljari."
"20958740-0-4791";"Go ahead."
"20958740-0-4792";"Poisonous mead is a key. To a door?"

"20958740-0-4794";"I'll do that."
"20958740-0-4795";"Where are they?"
"20958740-0-4796";"You seem very busy. Is there anything I can do to help?"
"20958740-0-4798";"I could round them up for you."
"20958740-0-4799";"I'll find the captain there."
"20958740-0-4800";"What's going on?"
"20958740-0-4801";"How does this concern me?"
"20958740-0-4802";"Who leads the army?"
"20958740-0-4804";"So I should be careful?"
"20958740-0-4805";"Who opened the portals?"
"20958740-0-4806";"How does that help against the Black Daggers?"
"20958740-0-4809";"Sure, why not?"
"20958740-0-4810";"You don't think he's trying to help these people?"
"20958740-0-4813";"But how to prove it?"
"20958740-0-4815";"Sounds easy."
"20958740-0-4816";"Do you know where the mage took them?"
"20958740-0-4817";"Who is he?"
"20958740-0-4818";"The cult hopes to gather the shards of Wuuthrad. They managed to find one here."
"20958740-0-4819";"What are the books about?"
"20958740-0-4820";"I'll be happy to get it back for you."
"20958740-0-4821";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-0-4822";"Did the thane survive?"

"20958740-0-4824";"<Something isn't right here. Perhaps something happened in town.>"
"20958740-0-4825";"I'll meet you back in town as soon as I'm done."
"20958740-0-4828";"Who?"
"20958740-0-4829";"But how do I identify you?"
"20958740-0-4831";"I'll do that."
"20958740-0-4832";"I'll do that."
"20958740-0-4833";"How goes the investigation?"
"20958740-0-4834";"Is your village defenseless?"
"20958740-0-4835";"The risen dead?"
"20958740-0-4837";"I'll head there now to help."
"20958740-0-4842";"Want me to get rid of them for you?"
"20958740-0-4843";"The manor?"
"20958740-0-4844";"I could take a look around."
"20958740-0-4846";"Who's in charge? Is anyone treating the sick?"

"20958740-0-4855";"Where do I fit in?"
"20958740-0-4856";"They'll what? Why should I let them capture me?"
"20958740-0-4857";"Where is she now?"
"20958740-0-4858";"All right. I'll go speak to Watch Captain Astanya."
"20958740-0-4859";"As you say. I'll go check in."
"20958740-0-4860";"All right. I'll speak to Watch Captain Astanya."
"20958740-0-4861";"As you say, then."
"20958740-0-4866";"How do we set things right?"
"20958740-0-4867";"Why can't you deal with this?"
"20958740-0-4868";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-0-4869";"By Cultists?"
"20958740-0-4870";"What's it worth to you if I check out Ivarstead?"
"20958740-0-4872";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4873";"I'll do my best."
"20958740-0-4875";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-4877";"And this means what to me?"

"20958740-0-4892";"I won't tell him. Thank you."
"20958740-0-4893";"So you want me to deal with the bugs?"
"20958740-0-4894";"What happened?"
"20958740-0-4899";"I'll find the captain there."

"20958740-0-4902";"<Continue reading.>"
"20958740-0-4907";"I should bring the staff to Fallowstone Hall."
"20958740-0-4909";"You have that much pull with the king?"
"20958740-0-4910";"What do you have in mind?"
"20958740-0-4911";"Let me help. Where is she?"
"20958740-0-4913";"I work for Queen Ayrenn. If there's a problem here—"
"20958740-0-4914";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"20958740-0-4915";"Our mutual Khajiit friend? Razum-dar?"
"20958740-0-4916";"I can help. What do you need?"
"20958740-0-4917";"I can be a diversion. What do you need?"
"20958740-0-4919";"Aren't the Red Rooks just common bandits?"
"20958740-0-4920";"What's the problem?"
"20958740-0-4921";"You were on an important mission?"
"20958740-0-4922";"I won't. Which test comes first?"
"20958740-0-4923";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-4924";"What does he say?"
"20958740-0-4925";"Do you need some help?"
"20958740-0-4926";"Can I lend a hand?"
"20958740-0-4927";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4928";"How can we stop them?"
"20958740-0-4930";"You captured a Red Rook bandit?"
"20958740-0-4933";"Stop that. What kind of school is this?"
"20958740-0-4936";"Where's the rest of your crew?"
"20958740-0-4937";"And you said the Veiled Queen is here?"
"20958740-0-4938";"<Touch the circular disk.>"
"20958740-0-4939";"Is this all that remains of your crew?"

"20958740-0-4941";"<Accept mission.>"
"20958740-0-4944";"So what's the problem?"
"20958740-0-4946";"Do you have a plan?"
"20958740-0-4949";"And why are the mages here?"
"20958740-0-4951";"Any way I can pitch in?"
"20958740-0-4953";"I'll get there as fast as I can."
"20958740-0-4954";"Perhaps I could help?"
"20958740-0-4955";"So you saw it, too?"
"20958740-0-4958";"What's his plan?"
"20958740-0-4959";"Is there anything I can do to help you?"

"20958740-0-4970";"Your friend left to be a Goblin?"
"20958740-0-4971";"There are more prisoners in this cave?"
"20958740-0-4976";"I should read the note."
"20958740-0-4977";"And you're going to do something about it?"
"20958740-0-4978";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-4979";"Where did they go?"
"20958740-0-4981";"Why not?"
"20958740-0-4983";"Where can I find this woman?"

"20958740-0-7893";"I'll head to the Dragonguard Sanctum and speak with Sai Sahan."
"20958740-0-7894";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-7895";"An urgent matter? Did he say anything else?"
"20958740-0-7897";"Can you help him?"
"20958740-0-7898";"I'll return to the sanctum and speak with Sai Sahan."
"20958740-0-7899";"I'll return to the Dragonguard Sanctum and talk to Nahfahlaar."
"20958740-0-7901";"And you don't agree with that approach?"
"20958740-0-7902";"Svana didn't say what she wanted?"
"20958740-0-7904";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-7905";"Why would wolves attack farmhands?"
"20958740-0-7906";"What do you think might have happened?"
"20958740-0-7907";"The coven isn't acting alone. Someone called the Ashen Lord commands vampires and werewolves."
"20958740-0-7908";"You think the people who responded to the flier we found are in danger?"
"20958740-0-7909";"Important business? And what friend?"
"20958740-0-7912";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-7913";"How do we stop the harrowstorm?"
"20958740-0-7914";"Svargrim is a vampire. He's working with the Gray Host."
"20958740-0-7915";"Where do you want me to look?"
"20958740-0-7916";"Lyris and I know a scholar of sorts who's trying to understand the harrowstorm ritual."
"20958740-0-7918";"Who's coming? The ones who attacked you?"
"20958740-0-7919";"Tell me about Solitude."
"20958740-0-7920";"Why don't you check on them?"
"20958740-0-7921";"Where are the instruments now?"
"20958740-0-7923";"So, she's conscripting the vampires into an army?"
"20958740-0-7924";"Have you found anything?"
"20958740-0-7925";"Are you going to send out more soldiers?"
"20958740-0-7928";"What do you mean the mountain's going to explode?"
"20958740-0-7929";"You just ran away?"
"20958740-0-7930";"To what end?"
"20958740-0-7931";"So what do we do if High King Svargrim refuses to see us?"
"20958740-0-7933";"What do you think happened to your supplies?"
"20958740-0-7937";"I almost forgot about that."

"20958740-0-7955";"I should talk to <<1>> in Solitude about what these tasks entail."
"20958740-0-7956";"What is it you need?"

"20958740-0-7965";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-7966";"What's so special about these ruins?"
"20958740-0-7967";"So you don't think there's a need for these ghost hunters?"
"20958740-0-7968";"So what's the problem?"
"20958740-0-7971";"So, Falgravn invaded Kyne's Aegis?"
"20958740-0-7972";"I should bring the Amulet of Bats to Thane Ogvar."
"20958740-0-7973";"I should bring the Bloodstone Chalice to Thane Ogvar."

"20958740-0-7981";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-7982";"You just need me to kill it?"
"20958740-0-7983";"That's right. Something about an inn in Eastmarch."
"20958740-0-7985";"Is Fennorian all right?"
"20958740-0-7986";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-7987";"I'll find Princess Svana in Solitude."
"20958740-0-7990";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-7991";"No, what kind of monster is this?"
"20958740-0-7992";"The Antiquarian's Eye?"
"20958740-0-7993";"So, I need to have a relic in mind. Got it. Then what?"
"20958740-0-7994";"Do you know what Svana wants with me?"
"20958740-0-7995";"Did Svana say anything else?"
"20958740-0-7997";"If that's all, why not get them yourself?"
"20958740-0-7998";"You want me to kill the werewolves?"
"20958740-0-7999";"Why's that a problem for us?"
"20958740-0-8000";"What creatures?"
"20958740-0-8001";"What is the Shademother?"
"20958740-0-8002";"How fresh?"

"20958740-0-8041";"Tell me more about the Gray Host."
"20958740-0-8042";"Rada al-Saran said he needs something called the Arkthzand Keystone. He sent Belain to find it."
"20958740-0-8043";"What could be worse than all those deaths?"
"20958740-0-8044";"Has Verandis been acting differently?"
"20958740-0-8045";"I should talk to <<1>> in Markarth about what these tasks entail."
"20958740-0-8046";"A Ghostsong clan witch attempted to awaken the Dark Heart. Arana and I stopped her."
"20958740-0-8047";"And what do we do when we get there?"
"20958740-0-8048";"And what do we do when we get there?"
"20958740-0-8049";"What exactly are they trying to accomplish?"
"20958740-0-8050";"What does the Wildblood need done?"
"20958740-0-8051";"What do you need from me?"
"20958740-0-8052";"What do you need from me?"
"20958740-0-8053";"You said the Darkstorm is your creation?"
"20958740-0-8054";"Does Verandis think he can stop it?"
"20958740-0-8055";"What do I need to do to succeed?"
"20958740-0-8056";"You're worried that your husband got lost?"
"20958740-0-8057";"You said the storm disrupted your wards?"
"20958740-0-8059";"What's in it for me?"
"20958740-0-8060";"Why is that a problem?"
"20958740-0-8061";"What about Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain?"
"20958740-0-8062";"Right. Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain need as many deaths as possible to awaken the Dark Heart."
"20958740-0-8063";"So what are you proposing?"
"20958740-0-8065";"How can I help?"

"20958740-0-8078";"And the lockbox is in this mine?"
"20958740-0-8080";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8082";"What kind of ritual?"
"20958740-0-8083";"What do you mean, unstable forces?"
"20958740-0-8084";"What does the rod do?"

"20958740-0-8285";"Why does Taupezu Azzida need to die?"
"20958740-0-8286";"So what do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8289";"So you need someone to free the prisoners?"
"20958740-0-8292";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8293";"Do you happen to know what this is all about?"
"20958740-0-8296";"Why can't you explore the wilds yourself?"
"20958740-0-8298";"Who is Uxark?"
"20958740-0-8303";"Maybe. Can you remind me what you need done?"
"20958740-0-8305";"You think they canceled the auction on account of you?"
"20958740-0-8306";"What are you trying to retrieve?"
"20958740-0-8308";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8309";"You think anything like that has survived here?"
"20958740-0-8311";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8312";"Lyranth? Where is she?"
"20958740-0-8313";"Synchroseisiac state?"
"20958740-0-8314";"The Order of the Waking Flame?"
"20958740-0-8315";"What's the rush?"
"20958740-0-8316";"Did Lyranth say anything else?"
"20958740-0-8317";"Anything else I need to know?"
"20958740-0-8325";"What do you plan to do?"
"20958740-0-8326";"Do you know what she wants?"
"20958740-0-8328";"Who stole the awl?"
"20958740-0-8329";"How do I know what Zenithar wants from me?"
"20958740-0-8333";"Any idea where we should look for Valessea?"
"20958740-0-8335";"Your eyes and ears?"
"20958740-0-8336";"Captain Kaleen saw the dockmaster accept gold from the Magus when they captured her."
"20958740-0-8337";"Where should we start?"
"20958740-0-8338";"What's vulk'esh scoria?"
"20958740-0-8339";"Why can't you take the items from the altars?"
"20958740-0-8340";"So Hadolids took your sheep?"
"20958740-0-8342";"What's in it for me?"
"20958740-0-8344";"Where is the talking skull?"
"20958740-0-8345";"Why do you think Anton won't survive?"
"20958740-0-8346";"Why are the Fighters and Mages Guilds invited to the peace talks?"
"20958740-0-8347";"How are you going to get your friend out of this promise?"
"20958740-0-8348";"Can't the commander's daughter just refuse?"
"20958740-0-8349";"And what do you need from me?"
"20958740-0-8350";"So you want me to recover the intelligence?"
"20958740-0-8351";"Did she say why he won't survive?"
"20958740-0-8352";"How will we get to the island?"
"20958740-0-8353";"Anything else?"
"20958740-0-8354";"Right. The Ascendant Lord told the Magus to assemble the Order on High Isle."
"20958740-0-8355";"You mean the Ascendant Order meeting happening here on High Isle?"
"20958740-0-8356";"Where do we get a ship like that?"
"20958740-0-8357";"How do we go up against a fleet of warships?"
"20958740-0-8358";"What does she want?"
"20958740-0-8359";"Why didn't she want you to enter the tower?"
"20958740-0-8360";"How do you know Veslyn is with the prisoners?"
"20958740-0-8361";"You need another druid to cleanse the corruption?"
"20958740-0-8362";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-8363";"You said the menders don't know the cause?"
"20958740-0-8364";"What happens if you have to close the manor?"
"20958740-0-8365";"So we need to investigate the sites marked on the map?"
"20958740-0-8366";"How will you find Oblan?"
"20958740-0-8368";"There's a mine on the prison island?"
"20958740-0-8371";"Do you mean delegate-at-large?"
"20958740-0-8373";"I should talk to <<1>> in Gonfalon Bay about what this dangerous work entails."
"20958740-0-8375";"Can't you just appeal to the jailers and tell them they made a mistake?"
"20958740-0-8377";"What about the Ascendant Lord? Isn't he still a threat?"
"20958740-0-8378";"Where will I find Lady Arabelle?"
"20958740-0-8380";"What's the plan?"
"20958740-0-8381";"I should bring the Fleet Queen's Talisman to Admiral Galvendier."
"20958740-0-8382";"I should bring the Coral Heart to Admiral Galvendier."
"20958740-0-8383";"I'll join your landing party."
"20958740-0-8384";"Just like that? And you don't know what happened?"
"20958740-0-8385";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-8386";"What do you want to do about it?"
"20958740-0-8388";"Is the ring still important to you?"
"20958740-0-8389";"So you'd like to help her, then?"
"20958740-0-8390";"Is this another formal request?"
"20958740-0-8394";"You aren't afraid I'd just run off with it?"
"20958740-0-8395";"You want to build a new ship?"
"20958740-0-8398";"What sort of disaster?"
"20958740-0-8399";"So you want me to recover the intelligence?"
"20958740-0-8400";"So you want me to recover the intelligence?"
"20958740-0-8403";"A sign of what?"
"20958740-0-8405";"Has there been a new lead to follow up on?"
"20958740-0-8406";"Sounds interesting. How would someone get started?"
"20958740-0-8407";"How do I play?"
"20958740-0-8408";"Thanks, Kishka. <Take a list of opponents.>"
"20958740-0-8409";"I accept the challenge."
"20958740-0-8411";"What's in it for me?"
"20958740-0-8412";"Excavating the property? Why?"
"20958740-0-8413";"I'll be sure to speak with Brahgas and Sorinne. Anything else?"
"20958740-0-8414";"And what's that?"
"20958740-0-8415";"How will the tournament play out?"
"20958740-0-8416";"Anything else?"
"20958740-0-8417";"So I need to defeat Wildhorn. Anything else?"
"20958740-0-8418";"What kind of assistance are we talking about?"
"20958740-0-8421";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-8423";"So what do you need from me?"
"20958740-0-8424";"What are Hadolids?"
"20958740-0-8425";"Is that all?"
"20958740-0-8429";"What do I need to do exactly?"
"20958740-0-8432";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8433";"Where do I find molting Hadolids?"
"20958740-0-8434";"What do I need to do?"
"20958740-0-8436";"Is she all right?"
"20958740-0-8437";"So where do I come in?"
"20958740-0-8438";"You mean these druids are hostile?"
"20958740-0-8439";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-8443";"What are you trying to say?"
"20958740-0-8445";"Sure, I'll go talk to Razhamad."
"20958740-0-8446";"I'll talk to Razhamad in the Gonfalon Bay Gaming Hall"
"20958740-0-8448";"All right, I'll go talk to Razhamad in Gonfalon Bay."
"20958740-0-8449";"Thanks, Kishka. <Take list of opponents>"
"20958740-0-8450";"I accept the challenge."
"20958740-0-8452";"Do things like that happen at Tor Draioch often?"
"20958740-0-8453";"You're here to fight the Gray Host?"
"20958740-0-8454";"Why would another druid kill the archdruid?"
"20958740-0-8456";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8457";"How do you plan to learn that?"
"20958740-0-8459";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8460";"So Hadolids took your sheep?"
"20958740-0-8461";"How are you going to attract wealthy visitors?"
"20958740-0-8465";"What kind of lead was he looking into?"
"20958740-0-8466";"What mission is that?"
"20958740-0-8467";"How did the druids open the fissures?"
"20958740-0-8469";"Would the alliance leaders really abandon the peace talks now?"
"20958740-0-8470";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8471";"What did Lady Arabelle say exactly, Za'ji?"
"20958740-0-8473";"What do you have in mind?"
"20958740-0-8474";"What's distracting the druids?"
"20958740-0-8476";"What does this training involve?"
"20958740-0-8477";"What do you think Archdruid Orlaith will do next?"
"20958740-0-8478";"How do we do that?"
"20958740-0-8479";"So what does Lady Arabelle want to do?"
"20958740-0-8480";"Poof?"
"20958740-0-8481";"Galen? You think the Ascendant Order is hiding on that island?"
"20958740-0-8484";"What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8486";"The trials of knowledge, endurance and bravery, right?"
"20958740-0-8488";"Why would it take more time without Umindior?"
"20958740-0-8489";"Tell me about the Spirit of the Path."
"20958740-0-8490";"Why send me, exactly?"
"20958740-0-8491";"Your crew?"
"20958740-0-8493";"So you want me to get rid of the wolves?"
"20958740-0-8509";"Are these two things connected somehow?"
"20958740-0-8511";"I should talk to Arbaud Cedmaine in Vastyr about what this work entails."
"20958740-0-8513";"And you want me to collect these radiant cores for you?"
"20958740-0-8514";"Where do I come into this?"
"20958740-0-8515";"How am I supposed to capture these creatures for you?"
"20958740-0-8516";"I'm sure they are. What do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8517";"Aren't pirates dangerous?"
"20958740-0-8518";"Y'ffre's Path? What do you need me to do there?"
"20958740-0-8524";"What can I do?"
"20958740-0-8525";"Why do I need a group to collect some moths?"
"20958740-0-8526";"What can I do?"
"20958740-0-8527";"Can they be healed?"
"20958740-0-8528";"What sort of frenzy?"
"20958740-0-8529";"What kind of help does Druid Laurel need?"
"20958740-0-8531";"Where can I find Sir Stefan?"
"20958740-0-8534";"What's your plan now?"
"20958740-0-8536";"And if I can handle more than that?"
"20958740-0-8538";"Yes, Captain Siravaen told us that the Dreadsails and Firesong were preparing to attack the city."
"20958740-0-8539";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-8541";"What's distracting the druids?"
"20958740-0-8542";"What can I do to help?"
"20958740-0-8546";"And where do I come into this?"
"20958740-0-8547";"Where's your wife?"
"20958740-0-8548";"Is Count Mornard planning a rescue?"
"20958740-0-8607";"Archdruid Orlaith took the sacred seeds to Y'ffelon."
"20958740-0-8609";"What's distracting the druids?"
"20958740-0-8610";"You want me to work for a Daedric Prince?"
"20958740-0-8614";"What sort of cooperation?"
"20958740-0-8615";"It sounds like you don't trust the prelate."
"20958740-0-8616";"Why is this place more important than the other two sites?"
"20958740-0-8617";"A contradiction in reality?"
"20958740-0-8618";"How do we do that, Leramil?"
"20958740-0-8619";"Apocrypha seems intent on even keeping us from learning too much about all this."
"20958740-0-8620";"And what was that about Necrom?"
"20958740-0-8621";"They sent you to investigate all by yourself?"
"20958740-0-8622";"What do you want me to do?"
"20958740-0-8623";"Corrupt? How?"
"20958740-0-8624";"What would we need to do?"
"20958740-0-8625";"What do you need, Landolvel?"
"20958740-0-8626";"Why do you think I'll help you?"
"20958740-0-8627";"What happened to you?"
"20958740-0-8628";"What are these ingredients?"
"20958740-0-8633";"What's so important about this letter that people want to kill you?"
"20958740-0-8634";"The rest of the forgotten memory is contained in two more glyphics."
"20958740-0-8635";"How would you lose your pact?"
"20958740-0-8636";"Who are the Painted Eye?"
"20958740-0-8637";"If there's a barrier, how can you escape?"
"20958740-0-8638";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-8639";"Why can't you steal it back from the Voidprowlers?"
"20958740-0-8640";"I can help you return these books."
"20958740-0-8641";"What would you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8642";"Where do you suppose Nathyn is now?"
"20958740-0-8656";"How do I reach Bastion Nymic?"
"20958740-0-8658";"By procure do you mean steal?"
"20958740-0-8659";"What sort of help do you need?"
"20958740-0-8660";"Do you need someone to relay a message?"
"20958740-0-8661";"Where can we find Federo?"
"20958740-0-8662";"Why does she want to meet?"
"20958740-0-8663";"Was she the only one to respond?"
"20958740-0-8664";"How can your former associate help?"
"20958740-0-8665";"Sounds like you have a plan."
"20958740-0-8666";"How do you want to deal with the adversary?"
"20958740-0-8667";"What will this text do for us?"
"20958740-0-8668";"There must be some way to follow them, Leramil."
"20958740-0-8671";"Do something? What, exactly?"
"20958740-0-8672";"What's the Itinerant Staff?"
"20958740-0-8674";"Slime-worshipping librarians?"
"20958740-0-8675";"What's so special about this relic?"
"20958740-0-8677";"That doesn't sound good."
"20958740-0-8678";"What sort of cooperation?"
"20958740-0-8679";"What sort of cooperation?"
"20958740-0-8681";"How could they take your pact?"
"20958740-0-8684";"Scruut, the message?"
"20958740-0-8685";"What Nord woman?"
"20958740-0-8689";"What does Ansuul want?"
"20958740-0-8690";"I should bring the Dreamstone to Wizard Twelvane."
"20958740-0-8691";"I should bring the Whispering Dreamstone to Wizard Twelvane."
"20958740-0-8692";"A Mages Guild member summoned something terrible?"
"20958740-0-8693";"You want me to go gather some eggs?"
"20958740-0-8694";"If you think you've found the missing goods, why haven't you retrieved them yourselves?"
"20958740-0-8695";"What materials do you need from Quires Wind?"
"20958740-0-8696";"You want me to recover the temple secrets?"
"20958740-0-8697";"Where can I find these Dremnaken?"
"20958740-0-8698";"Why do you think your missing ships are in Apocrypha?"
"20958740-0-8699";"How can I help?"
"20958740-0-8700";"What is a Walking Nightmare?"
"20958740-0-8701";"You sent investigators into Apocrypha?"
"20958740-0-8702";"So, how can I get this knowledge?"
"20958740-0-8703";"An arcanist?"
"20958740-0-8704";"How do you plan to track them?"
"20958740-0-8706";"What will you do now?"
"20958740-0-8707";"Did she say anything else?"
"20958740-0-8714";"Stop Cipher Akacirn? How?"
"20958740-0-8720";"How do I reach Bastion Nymic?"
"20958740-0-8721";"How do I reach Bastion Nymic?"
"20958740-0-8722";"How do I reach Bastion Nymic?"
"20958740-0-8723";"That's not exactly what happened, but what do you need me to do?"
"20958740-0-8726";"What did they want you to build?"
"20958740-0-8727";"You think the prelate was lying?"
"20958740-0-8728";"Did she say anything else?"
"20958740-0-8729";"Why's that?"
"20958740-0-8730";"What do you want me to do?"
"20958740-0-8731";"And what was that about Necrom?"
"20958740-0-8732";"What's your plan?"
"20958740-0-8733";"Borrow?"
"20958740-0-8734";"Won't it be dangerous to bring them all back to one place?"
"20958740-0-8735";"Of course."
"20958740-0-8737";"We find her and erase her."
"20958740-0-8738";"<Accept mission.>"
"20958740-0-8739";"<Accept mission.>"
"20958740-0-8740";"<Accept mission.>"
"20958740-0-8741";"You don't know what your enemies want?"
"20958740-0-8744";"What was that about the threads of fate?"
"20958740-0-8745";"Could Vashabar's Wood Elves be involved with the Recollection?"
"20958740-0-8746";"What do you think the Recollection's looking for?"
"20958740-0-8747";"The Staff of Many Paths? Didn't Shardmarshal Vargas give that to Nantharion at Hoperoot?"
"20958740-0-8748";"What do you mean?"
"20958740-0-8749";"So what do you suggest?"
"20958740-0-8750";"Apocrypha's a pretty big place. How will we find her?"
"20958740-0-8751";"That's it? Just place the three relics in specific locations?"
"20958740-0-8753";"What's the favor? And why won't your fathers let you wed?"
"20958740-0-8756";"If you command the cohort, why weren't you here with them?"
"20958740-0-8757";"What do you want me to do?"
"20958740-0-8758";"New forest?"
"20958740-0-8759";"What's the Emblem of the Last King?"
"20958740-0-8761";"So you were invited to this auction?"
"20958740-0-8762";"What's so important about this keep?"
"20958740-0-8763";"You're a vampire?"
"20958740-0-8764";"How will I know which pages you want?"
"20958740-0-8765";"What are you trying to get from inside the ruins?"
"20958740-0-8766";"What do you need from me?"
"20958740-0-8767";"What do you want me to do?"
"20958740-0-8769";"What kind of help do you need?"
"20958740-0-8770";"Where did the brigand run off to?"
"20958740-0-8771";"What kind of help are you looking for?"
"20958740-0-8773";"If warring Goblins are so dangerous, why not let the hunters handle it?"
"20958740-0-8774";"How can I find this book?"
"20958740-0-8775";"Do you know where I can find the supplies you need?"
"20958740-0-8778";"Is the Mages Guild keeping this a secret?"
"20958740-0-8779";"What is it you want me to do, exactly?"
"20958740-0-8780";"An investigator?"
"20958740-0-8781";"You mentioned enemies. Could the cohort have been attacked?"

"20958740-1-3972";"I'll see you later."
"20958740-1-3974";"I will. What's the Nord way?"
"20958740-1-3975";"I'll retrieve your cargo and recover the manifest."
"20958740-1-3978";"All right. I'll look into it."
"20958740-1-3979";"I'll bear that in mind."
"20958740-1-3980";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-3984";"I'll see you there."
"20958740-1-3985";"Very well. I will speak with your friends."
"20958740-1-3986";"I'll locate your scouts and find out what's happening."
"20958740-1-3987";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-3989";"I will keep an eye on <<1>>."
"20958740-1-3990";"I'm ready to drink the Hist sap."
"20958740-1-3991";"I'll ask the pilgrims."
"20958740-1-3995";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-1-3996";"I'll talk to Taldyn."
"20958740-1-3997";"I'll take care of them."
"20958740-1-3998";"I'll go speak to <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4000";"I'll see what he knows."
"20958740-1-4001";"I'll talk to the mercenaries."
"20958740-1-4003";"I'll meet you at <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4005";"I'll speak to him."
"20958740-1-4009";"Thank you for your time, Grandmaster."
"20958740-1-4012";"Thank you, Sen."
"20958740-1-4013";"Not a problem."
"20958740-1-4014";"I'll look for her."
"20958740-1-4015";"It'll do. I'll see to getting that treasure."
"20958740-1-4018";"We'll see."
"20958740-1-4019";"I'll find the gel and free your people."
"20958740-1-4021";"Then I'll find <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4022";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4026";"I'll speak to your grandmaster."
"20958740-1-4030";"I'll speak with them and decide."
"20958740-1-4032";"I'll set their souls free."
"20958740-1-4035";"I can."
"20958740-1-4036";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4039";"Wait here. I'll get the keystone."
"20958740-1-4042";"Done. I'll return shortly."
"20958740-1-4043";"I'll bring any medallions I find to you."
"20958740-1-4045";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-4046";"I'll see if I can find him."
"20958740-1-4050";"Then let me look into it."
"20958740-1-4051";"I'll see if I can find him."
"20958740-1-4057";"I'll see what I can find out."
"20958740-1-4059";"I'll get started."
"20958740-1-4060";"Thank you, Walks-in-Ash."
"20958740-1-4061";"I'll get those caves closed, Sergeant."
"20958740-1-4062";"You too. I'll make for Vivec's Antlers."
"20958740-1-4069";"I will find the crystal fragments."
"20958740-1-4070";"I will do this for you."
"20958740-1-4071";"Leave it to me."
"20958740-1-4073";"Very well."
"20958740-1-4079";"I'll bear that in mind."
"20958740-1-4082";"Sure, let me just get this open."
"20958740-1-4083";"Sure. Let me help you out."
"20958740-1-4088";"Im on it!"
"20958740-1-4090";"Of course. Hang on a moment while I let you out."
"20958740-1-4092";"I'll find her, Elder."
"20958740-1-4097";"Very well, I'll go after the Dreadlord."
"20958740-1-4113";"I'll get them out."
"20958740-1-4114";"Perhaps I can get those pieces of the stone back."
"20958740-1-4116";"I'll rescue them."
"20958740-1-4123";"I'll talk to her and we'll see."
"20958740-1-4126";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-4127";"I will see it done."
"20958740-1-4129";"Yes, I can."
"20958740-1-4130";"I'll find <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4131";"I'll do as you say, Curate."
"20958740-1-4132";"Where can I find the keys?"
"20958740-1-4133";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4140";"I'll do what I can to help."
"20958740-1-4142";"You warn the guards. I'll help the Ordinators."
"20958740-1-4147";"I'll look for her."
"20958740-1-4148";"I'll do that."
"20958740-1-4149";"I'll burn the supplies and tell you about it when I'm done."
"20958740-1-4150";"I'll see you on the road after I finish."
"20958740-1-4152";"I'll find <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4153";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4154";"Sure, why not."
"20958740-1-4155";"Explain yourself."
"20958740-1-4162";"I'll see what I can do. Give me the kit."
"20958740-1-4163";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-1-4166";"I can get you there. Follow me."
"20958740-1-4169";"If your brother still lives, I'll find him."
"20958740-1-4171";"I'll find her. Good luck."
"20958740-1-4173";"I'll get that heart."
"20958740-1-4174";"I'll find the tree-minder and talk to him."
"20958740-1-4175";"I'll find <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4177";"Let's see this through."
"20958740-1-4180";"I'll speak to the spirits."
"20958740-1-4187";"I'll find Slips-Through-Fingers."
"20958740-1-4189";"I should investigate Razak's Wheel and find out what the Imperials are doing."
"20958740-1-4192";"I'll gather the relics for you."
"20958740-1-4194";"I'll go speak with him."
"20958740-1-4195";"I'll head to the dungeon."
"20958740-1-4196";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4198";"I'll head to White Rose and look for her."
"20958740-1-4206";"<Look around for the missing items.>"
"20958740-1-4207";"I'll save Dithis from his impending … marriage."
"20958740-1-4208";"I'm on it."
"20958740-1-4209";"I'll see it done."
"20958740-1-4211";"Let's do it."
"20958740-1-4214";"As long as the money's good, I'm in."
"20958740-1-4216";"Ok, I'll click them."
"20958740-1-4218";"As long as the money's good."
"20958740-1-4219";"All right. I'll assist you."
"20958740-1-4224";"I can do this, whatever these creatures may be."
"20958740-1-4228";"I'll speak to your grandmaster."
"20958740-1-4229";"Thank you, Grandmaster."
"20958740-1-4230";"I'll tell him, Tanval. Now let's see this done."
"20958740-1-4234";"I'll recover the pieces of your reliquary."
"20958740-1-4238";"Leave it to me."
"20958740-1-4241";"I suppose so."
"20958740-1-4247";"Consider it done."
"20958740-1-4249";"I'll be careful … and I'll recover your broken staff."
"20958740-1-4252";"I'm ready to go if you are."
"20958740-1-4255";"I'm interested."
"20958740-1-4256";"I'll take the key to <<1>> and pass along your warning."
"20958740-1-4257";"I'll get that Fang."
"20958740-1-4259";"I'm interested."
"20958740-1-4267";"Ah. In that case, where do I sign up?"
"20958740-1-4270";"I'll rescue your fellows and bring back the scrolls you need."
"20958740-1-4271";"I'll do what I can, spirit."
"20958740-1-4273";"I'll go find her, then."
"20958740-1-4276";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4279";"I'll check out the house."
"20958740-1-4280";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4281";"Don't worry, I'll find the supplies."
"20958740-1-4285";"All right, I'll check the library vaults."
"20958740-1-4290";"That wine will be yours."
"20958740-1-4292";"I'll close the portals."
"20958740-1-4296";"I'll find Saint Veloth."
"20958740-1-4297";"I'll humor you, crow … for now."
"20958740-1-4298";"I'll return as soon as I can."
"20958740-1-4299";"I'll return with the grub grass."
"20958740-1-4302";"I'll be careful."
"20958740-1-4303";"I'll see if I can help <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4304";"I'll find the relics. Stay safe, Gandis."
"20958740-1-4305";"I will. Get going."
"20958740-1-4307";"I'll find them for you."
"20958740-1-4308";"I'll speak with the sage."
"20958740-1-4311";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4314";"I'll report in."
"20958740-1-4315";"I'll find them. Get going."
"20958740-1-4316";"I will. Get going."
"20958740-1-4317";"I will. Get going."
"20958740-1-4318";"Don't worry - I'll retrieve the pieces of the Crystal of Power."
"20958740-1-4320";"Murder for crystals. Got it."
"20958740-1-4321";"I can do that."
"20958740-1-4322";"I will return with the shards."
"20958740-1-4323";"I can do that!"
"20958740-1-4326";"I'll get it done."
"20958740-1-4327";"Sure, I can do that!"
"20958740-1-4329";"Ok I will."
"20958740-1-4333";"Well, all right, then."
"20958740-1-4334";"Hold on, I'll untie you."
"20958740-1-4335";"Well, be free."
"20958740-1-4336";"OK, now get out of here."
"20958740-1-4340";"Okay. I'll murder again."
"20958740-1-4342";"I will return when she is dead."
"20958740-1-4343";"More killing. Okay."
"20958740-1-4344";"Just point the way."
"20958740-1-4345";"Let's cut to the chase: you want him dead. Fine. I can do that. And then I'll loot him. As always."
"20958740-1-4346";"Thank you, Valaste."
"20958740-1-4350";"I can't wait."
"20958740-1-4352";"I'll grab any books I can find."
"20958740-1-4353";"I can do that."
"20958740-1-4354";"I'll grab any books I can find."
"20958740-1-4355";"I'm on it."
"20958740-1-4357";"They won't live to see tonight, soldier."
"20958740-1-4360";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4362";"I'll help you."
"20958740-1-4365";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-1-4366";"All … right."
"20958740-1-4379";"I'm on it."
"20958740-1-4383";"I'll mark the bodies for <<1>> to recover."
"20958740-1-4384";"I'll lend Saervild a hand."
"20958740-1-4385";"Sounds gross, but I'll do it."
"20958740-1-4387";"I'll do it. You just get out of here."
"20958740-1-4390";"Go wait with Diodore by the entry. I'll look further in."
"20958740-1-4391";"I'll track him down, Hoknir."
"20958740-1-4392";"All right. Lead on."
"20958740-1-4393";"I'll do it."
"20958740-1-4394";"I'll do what I can."
"20958740-1-4397";"I'm ready, Aelif."
"20958740-1-4398";"What are we waiting for, then?"
"20958740-1-4399";"Give me the bag. I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-4400";"I'll kill both of their leaders."
"20958740-1-4402";"Stay here. I'll find Eiman."
"20958740-1-4405";"If you insist."
"20958740-1-4413";"I'll do it."
"20958740-1-4415";"I'll do it. Good luck, Rana."
"20958740-1-4429";"If your brother still lives, I'll find him."
"20958740-1-4430";"If your brother still lives, I'll find him."
"20958740-1-4442";"I'll speak to Skorvild."
"20958740-1-4446";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4448";"I'm on my way."
"20958740-1-4449";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-4461";"The Covenant won't know what hit them."
"20958740-1-4466";"I'll look for your companions."
"20958740-1-4477";"I'll give it a try."
"20958740-1-4478";"I'll lend a hand."
"20958740-1-4480";"Gruesome, but probably effective. I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4483";"I understand. I have to choose between the docks and the fort."
"20958740-1-4486";"I'll return with some wolf pelts."
"20958740-1-4504";"All right. Let's get moving."
"20958740-1-4506";"Then that's where I'm headed."
"20958740-1-4507";"I'll find some of these flowers for you."
"20958740-1-4508";"Captain, are you all right?"
"20958740-1-4509";"I'll go and speak to Thane Mera."
"20958740-1-4510";"I'll see what I can find out about the Stormfist clan."
"20958740-1-4511";"I'll speak to Lenning at the western wall."
"20958740-1-4514";"I'll protect King Jorunn."
"20958740-1-4517";"I'll meet you at the barracks after I free the captured soldiers."
"20958740-1-4518";"I'll free the captured soldiers and meet Koruni at the barracks."
"20958740-1-4522";"I'll look into it."
"20958740-1-4523";"I will."
"20958740-1-4527";"I'll see what I can find."
"20958740-1-4528";"Right away, Prince Irnskar."
"20958740-1-4529";"I'll light the watchfires."
"20958740-1-4535";"I was heading in that direction, anyway."
"20958740-1-4537";"I'll check out the camp."
"20958740-1-4539";"What? Where?"
"20958740-1-4540";"I'm ready. Teleport me now."
"20958740-1-4541";"I'll do it."
"20958740-1-4542";"I'll go talk to Thane Harvald."
"20958740-1-4544";"I'll do it."
"20958740-1-4545";"Sounds like a fair trade."
"20958740-1-4549";"If you say so."
"20958740-1-4550";"I'll look for Scout Snowhunter."
"20958740-1-4551";"All right. Let's go."
"20958740-1-4552";"Consider it done."
"20958740-1-4557";"All right, I'll look for <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4561";"Free the mammoths, open the gates, and blow the horn. I'm on it."
"20958740-1-4563";"I'll speak to Berj about attending the party."
"20958740-1-4566";"I'll find your sword and shield for you."
"20958740-1-4567";"All right, I'll look for <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4572";"I will talk to <<1>>."
"20958740-1-4575";"I'll find your sister."
"20958740-1-4576";"Sounds like a plan."
"20958740-1-4578";"And you want to stop him?"
"20958740-1-4579";"I will find the other Keepers."
"20958740-1-4580";"All right. Let's start the tour."
"20958740-1-4582";"You warn the guards. I'll help the Ordinators."
"20958740-1-4584";"I'll go and talk to the cooks."
"20958740-1-4587";"I'll look for your missing performers."
"20958740-1-4588";"All right. I'll get there soon."
"20958740-1-4591";"I need to see the Dreamwalker."
"20958740-1-4592";"I understand. Thanks."
"20958740-1-4593";"I'll enter Sovngarde and stop Fildgor."
"20958740-1-4594";"I'll check on your family."
"20958740-1-4596";"I'll get that key."
"20958740-1-4599";"I understand."
"20958740-1-4600";"I'll make sure she's safe."
"20958740-1-4601";"I'll go find her."
"20958740-1-4602";"I'll free them and we'll do our best to rescue you."
"20958740-1-4604";"I'll head into the mine and do what I can."
"20958740-1-4606";"I can do that."
"20958740-1-4607";"I'll free the captives."
"20958740-1-4608";"Don't worry. I'll rescue the captain."
"20958740-1-4609";"I'll meet you there when I'm done."
"20958740-1-4611";"I'll set them free, Helgith."
"20958740-1-4612";"I'll set the dead free, Treva."
"20958740-1-4613";"I'll get your mammoths back."
"20958740-1-4614";"I'll look into it, and let Centurion Andrin know what I find."
"20958740-1-4616";"That shouldn't be too much of a problem."
"20958740-1-4618";"I'll take care of things and meet you there."
"20958740-1-4619";"Aye, Vigrod. I'm with you."
"20958740-1-4620";"I'll take the ore to Aleeto."
"20958740-1-4621";"You can count on me."
"20958740-1-4622";"You can count on me."
"20958740-1-4623";"If I see anything, I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4624";"I'll get you those shards."
"20958740-1-4625";"I'll look for them."
"20958740-1-4626";"I'll look for her."
"20958740-1-4627";"These crypts could be dangerous. Stay close!"
"20958740-1-4628";"I'll take care of it."
"20958740-1-4631";"Thanks for the information."
"20958740-1-4632";"I can check on things for you."

"20958740-1-5364";"All right. Where is Indaenir?"
"20958740-1-5369";"I'll help find your squad."
"20958740-1-5370";"<Take <<1>>'s token.>"
"20958740-1-5372";"All right. I'll help you disrupt the wards."

"20958740-1-5434";"I'll see what I can do."
"20958740-1-5439";"You read. I'll take the blood rune and repair the seals."
"20958740-1-5442";"I'll enter the cave and help the spirit."
"20958740-1-5443";"I'll try to deliver your message."
"20958740-1-5444";"I'll look for your friends."

"20958740-1-5575";"All right, I'll see if I can find them."
"20958740-1-5576";"I don't think that's what happened. I should go in and find Vanus."
