"204987124-0-7670";"You've made a mistake."
"204987124-0-7673";"You tricked me into killing my allies!"

"204987124-0-7760";"Is there anything I can do to help you?"
"204987124-0-7762";"You think Hosni is connected to the Supernal Dreamers?"

"204987124-0-8159";"He was escorting your wife home from the market."
"204987124-0-8161";"I could look for him."
"204987124-0-8162";"Sure. I'll tell her."
"204987124-0-8163";"Why would someone want to kill you?"
"204987124-0-8165";"I'll get General Thoda's attention."
"204987124-0-8166";"If you wish, I could be your messenger."
"204987124-0-8167";"I think your mother is joining a cult."
"204987124-0-8171";"I should tell Hada about this."
"204987124-0-8178";"What were you hoping to learn?"
"204987124-0-8183";"Here. I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-8184";"I'll look for the plans."
"204987124-0-8191";"At least you can release the knight."
"204987124-0-8195";"Do you know who tried to poison her?"
"204987124-0-8196";"Dame Falhut? She's one of the Knights of the Flame."
"204987124-0-8202";"Yes, but it was Dame Falhut who purchased the poison."
"204987124-0-8203";"I can do it."
"204987124-0-8207";"Where should I build the scarecrows?"
"204987124-0-8212";"Who exactly are the Knights of the Flame?"
"204987124-0-8213";"So you're stuck in Oldgate?"

"204987124-0-8407";"His worship sounds more like school."
"204987124-0-8409";"Is focusing on beauty seen as superficial?"

"204987124-0-8957";"How does the talisman work?"
"204987124-0-8970";"Have you discovered anything?"
"204987124-0-8971";"What will you do with the components?"
"204987124-0-8972";"Tell me about the Wyrd."
"204987124-0-8973";"You still came to help."
"204987124-0-8974";"Do you know why the forest has become so hostile?"
"204987124-0-8976";"Are you a wyress?"
"204987124-0-8977";"Why is Mother Murk your enemy?"
"204987124-0-8978";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-8981";"Who was that woman who appeared?"
"204987124-0-8983";"Sarvith thinks we can go back in time to learn about Faolchu's death."
"204987124-0-8985";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-8991";"Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
"204987124-0-8993";"Aren't you going to open the vault?"
"204987124-0-8994";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-8997";"I am willing to be the one."
"204987124-0-8999";"Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-9000";"What help do you need against the harpies?"
"204987124-0-9002";"I'll find your missing fighters."
"204987124-0-9018";"Remind me. What work is that?"
"204987124-0-9021";"The Ayleid King?"
"204987124-0-9023";"How will you stop him?"
"204987124-0-9028";"There must be some way to kill Faolchu."
"204987124-0-9037";"I killed Faolchu. Fire weakens him and makes him vulnerable."
"204987124-0-9038";"Alana's here?"
"204987124-0-9041";"Fire weakens him and makes him vulnerable."
"204987124-0-9042";"How can I stop the Hand from raising the dead here?"
"204987124-0-9049";"I killed Faolchu. Fire weakens him and makes him vulnerable."
"204987124-0-9053";"What happened to Alana?"
"204987124-0-9067";"You were screaming?"
"204987124-0-9068";"What do you know about the Bloodthorn?"
"204987124-0-9086";"Very well."
"204987124-0-9095";"What can you tell me about the Tears of the Dishonored?"
"204987124-0-9107";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-9108";"I'm working on it."
"204987124-0-9110";"She just vanished?"
"204987124-0-9111";"Then we'd better begin."
"204987124-0-9115";"Any idea where the crypt she talked about might be?"
"204987124-0-9117";"What are you suggesting?"
"204987124-0-9118";"I'll get the wolf's woe and the key."
"204987124-0-9128";"You left your journal at the camp."
"204987124-0-9129";"What's the Midnight Talisman?"
"204987124-0-9131";"So this talisman is the key to defeating Angof?"
"204987124-0-9138";"Why did they trade the women?"
"204987124-0-9146";"Consider the gate locked."
"204987124-0-9150";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-9151";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-9152";"What do you know of the wyresses?"
"204987124-0-9156";"All right. I'll replace the relics."
"204987124-0-9173";"How do I become an apprentice?"
"204987124-0-9175";"Where can I get one?"
"204987124-0-9177";"What must I do to become an apprentice?"
"204987124-0-9180";"How to I do that?"
"204987124-0-9186";"I'll look for the contract."
"204987124-0-9187";"Casnar's not there either."
"204987124-0-9193";"Why would they break your kneecaps?"
"204987124-0-9194";"Jagnas is the one who sent me."
"204987124-0-9196";"Maybe I should talk to him."
"204987124-0-9199";"General Gautier sent me to retrieve your master key."
"204987124-0-9200";"I noticed Bloodthorn cultists in the city."
"204987124-0-9201";"What's the catch?"
"204987124-0-9203";"Yes. I take issue with that."
"204987124-0-9205";"You've made a smart decision."
"204987124-0-9208";"What kind of favor are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-9212";"Tell me more about Mother Murk."
"204987124-0-9214";"Tell me more about Mother Murk."
"204987124-0-9215";"Tell me about Sibellec."
"204987124-0-9216";"How do I stop Mother Murk?"
"204987124-0-9218";"Tell me more about the spell you want me to cast."
"204987124-0-9219";"I'll defeat Mother Murk."
"204987124-0-9221";"Sounds simple enough. What do I do with them?"
"204987124-0-9222";"Why do you want my thoughts? I'm not from here."
"204987124-0-9223";"Where can I get one?"
"204987124-0-9231";"What's a lurcher?"
"204987124-0-9233";"Show me where the Imperials are coming in."
"204987124-0-9267";"Aren't you afraid the cult will retaliate?"
"204987124-0-9268";"Tell me about Faolchu."
"204987124-0-9269";"I'll place the candles for you."
"204987124-0-9270";"Tell me about Faolchu."
"204987124-0-9271";"What would you like me to do?"
"204987124-0-9272";"I'll tell him."
"204987124-0-9275";"Duke Sebastien will want to talk to you."
"204987124-0-9276";"Hold still and I'll cut you loose."
"204987124-0-9277";"Where can I get one?"
"204987124-0-9279";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-9285";"But can you make a cure?"
"204987124-0-9291";"What information?"
"204987124-0-9295";"We'll continue to look for a way to cure you."
"204987124-0-9296";"Of course. I'll wait here for you to return."
"204987124-0-9302";"How have the Ansei affected Alik'r?"
"204987124-0-9303";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-9304";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-9305";"What are the Ash'abah?"
"204987124-0-9306";"What are the Ash'abah again?"
"204987124-0-9307";"Are you poisoned as well, Marimah?"
"204987124-0-9308";"Why is this place called Morwha's Bounty?"
"204987124-0-9310";"Will destroying the corruption set you free?"
"204987124-0-9311";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"204987124-0-9312";"White mask? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-9313";"You were saying something about Angof and Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-9314";"You took a great risk leaving the redoubt without your protective magic. Why?"
"204987124-0-9315";"You were saying something about Angof and Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-9316";"You were saying something about Angof and Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-9325";"What can you tell me about the Battle of Glenumbra Moors?"
"204987124-0-9331";"So what happens next?"
"204987124-0-9332";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-9334";"Why is it important to find out how Faolchu died?"
"204987124-0-9338";"What actually happened here?"
"204987124-0-9340";"Tell me about the Alessian Order."
"204987124-0-9341";"Faolchu sounds fearsome."
"204987124-0-9342";"Tell me about the Direnni forces."
"204987124-0-9343";"Do you know who killed him?"
"204987124-0-9345";"So the one who slew Faolchu was Direnni?"
"204987124-0-9348";"Tell me about the Alessian Order."
"204987124-0-9351";"I could help."
"204987124-0-9352";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-9356";"There's something inside the talisman?"
"204987124-0-9357";"Put the talisman on the stone and kill what comes out. Got it."
"204987124-0-9358";"I'll kill it. What about you?"
"204987124-0-9367";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-9376";"Fire weakens Faolchu and makes him vulnerable."
"204987124-0-9386";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-9388";"I'll talk to these wyrd sisters."
"204987124-0-9405";"Tell me about the bandits."
"204987124-0-9406";"Tell me about the bandits."
"204987124-0-9407";"Tell me about the harpies."
"204987124-0-9408";"All right. I'll go get the Hag's Breath."
"204987124-0-9409";"I don't think Lafont had anything to do with it. And I've seen vines like that before."
"204987124-0-9411";"I'll ask Zhagush about the vines."
"204987124-0-9412";"Tell me more about the Bloodthorn cult."
"204987124-0-9413";"Who's Angof the Gravesinger?"
"204987124-0-9414";"Tell me more about the Bloodthorn cult."
"204987124-0-9415";"Tell me more about the vines."
"204987124-0-9429";"I'm here with the Shornhelm Guard. I can get you to a safer place."
"204987124-0-9430";"All right. I'll get you some weapons."
"204987124-0-9432";"What is the Bloodthorn cult?"
"204987124-0-9433";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"204987124-0-9434";"A Reachmage? What's that?"
"204987124-0-9435";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-9437";"You want me to get the crown for you."
"204987124-0-9438";"Help? How, exactly?"
"204987124-0-9439";"What do you need from me?"
"204987124-0-9440";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"204987124-0-9453";"Very well. I'll find weapons while you get your healing kit. We'll meet back here."
"204987124-0-9459";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-9462";"What can you tell me about Daggerfall?"
"204987124-0-9463";"Daggerfall seems to have its own share of troubles."
"204987124-0-9464";"What can you tell me about the king?"
"204987124-0-9465";"What can you tell me about the king?"
"204987124-0-9492";"How do I summon the guardians?"
"204987124-0-9497";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-9500";"One way or another, they will be dead."
"204987124-0-9504";"Will the curse harm me?"
"204987124-0-9505";"You want me to doom Lady Laurent?"
"204987124-0-9509";"I need fire to defeat Faolchu."
"204987124-0-9516";"I should take this tome to activate the pillars."
"204987124-0-9525";"Who was Leki?"
"204987124-0-9526";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-9527";"Who won?"
"204987124-0-9528";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-9529";"Did it work?"
"204987124-0-9531";"I would submit."
"204987124-0-9534";"I help my friend."
"204987124-0-9537";"I battle on."
"204987124-0-9541";"I choose history."
"204987124-0-9545";"What have you learned?"
"204987124-0-9548";"Is this what I was meant to learn?"
"204987124-0-9549";"Is this what I was meant to learn?"
"204987124-0-9550";"Is this what I was meant to learn?"
"204987124-0-9553";"Why would your students need experience?"
"204987124-0-9555";"What did <<1>> do?"
"204987124-0-9556";"She had a better sword arm than the bandit."
"204987124-0-9557";"Both the man and the woman were bandits."
"204987124-0-9558";"I'm ready for your next story."
"204987124-0-9559";"Both the man and the woman were bandits."
"204987124-0-9561";"Did anyone defeat him?"

"204987124-0-9570";"What became of him?"
"204987124-0-9572";"What is that story about?"
"204987124-0-9574";"She gave him an enchanted blade he could wield without pain."
"204987124-0-9575";"She promised to guard Leki's Blade in his place, to allow him to die in peace."
"204987124-0-9576";"She gave him an enchanted blade he could wield without pain."
"204987124-0-9577";"Do you have any other stories?"
"204987124-0-9581";"<<1>> mentioned my prior experience as well."
"204987124-0-9583";"Monster? What monster?"
"204987124-0-9584";"You mentioned a monster?"
"204987124-0-9585";"Here, take this sword and get to the Shornhelm Guard camp."
"204987124-0-9586";"He fell fighting against the Imperials. He intends to be used as a weapon against them."
"204987124-0-9595";"Can you tell me anything about where I'm going?"
"204987124-0-9601";"What happened at the farmhouse?"
"204987124-0-9602";"What happened at the farmhouse?"
"204987124-0-9603";"Here, take the daggers your father asked for and get to the Shornhelm Guard camp."
"204987124-0-9607";"Give me the key, unless you want to taste your own blood."
"204987124-0-9620";"I'm not sure this test proved your claims."
"204987124-0-9622";"What sort of treasure will I find?"
"204987124-0-9625";"What offerings should I place?"
"204987124-0-9626";"What are the Heralds and how do they work?"
"204987124-0-9627";"What are the Heralds and how do they work?"

"204987124-0-9695";"Your treasure is history?"
"204987124-0-9697";"What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-9699";"How do I exit this vault?"
"204987124-0-9702";"You turned him to stone?"
"204987124-0-9715";"I'll find the caches of weapons and armor."
"204987124-0-9722";"That was some time ago. I've found all the Hinaults since then."
"204987124-0-9724";"No, it's true. <<1>> was looking for you."
"204987124-0-9727";"What good would that do?"
"204987124-0-9731";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-9732";"Where have they taken them?"
"204987124-0-9735";"Why would that matter?"
"204987124-0-9738";"Why were they so interested in Camlorn?"
"204987124-0-9740";"You have a guide?"
"204987124-0-9745";"What do you need from me?"
"204987124-0-9761";"Do you have a plan?"
"204987124-0-9764";"What are we to do then?"
"204987124-0-9769";"How do we lock it?"
"204987124-0-9771";"What are we to do then?"
"204987124-0-9775";"Angof is still out there."
"204987124-0-9780";"Do you have any flame stalks?"
"204987124-0-9781";"Do you have any worm's head caps?"

"204987124-0-9787";"Do you have any worm's head caps?"
"204987124-0-9789";"You named your lizard ""Monkey""?"
"204987124-0-9790";"Ah hah. Right. Do you have any worm stalk caps?"
"204987124-0-9791";"So you got a lizard instead?"
"204987124-0-9796";"This isn't the time for a history lesson."
"204987124-0-9800";"Whatever you say."
"204987124-0-9801";"Then let's continue."
"204987124-0-9831";"The Queen of Evermore? You can't tell me any more than that?"
"204987124-0-9879";"How did you get that wound?"
"204987124-0-9891";"I don't hear anything. If you stand up to them, you'll set an example for the rest of the town."
"204987124-0-9893";"Tell me more about the guardians."
"204987124-0-9898";"I'll check on the dockmaster. You go on."

"204987124-0-9916";"I suggest you start by leaving this area."

"204987124-0-9965";"I'll get one for each of the surviving knights."
"204987124-0-9968";"What exactly will Tu'whacca's breath do?"
"204987124-0-9969";"Where does the pearl come in?"
"204987124-0-9970";"Are you as crazy as you pretend to be?"
"204987124-0-9972";"What will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-9973";"What happened to the pearl?"
"204987124-0-9975";"What is the pearl?"
"204987124-0-9977";"I think you're repeating things."
"204987124-0-9978";"What happens after the call is answered?"
"204987124-0-9993";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-9994";"I'll talk to the councilors."
"204987124-0-10003";"Where should I check for your patrols?"
"204987124-0-10004";"Where should I check for your patrols?"
"204987124-0-10005";"Tell me more about Gabrielle Benele."
"204987124-0-10006";"Dorp?"
"204987124-0-10009";"Any idea who's in charge of these bandits?"
"204987124-0-10010";"I can help fight through."
"204987124-0-10014";"But she doesn't look like a bloodfiend."
"204987124-0-10018";"Do you really want to be responsible for more deaths?"
"204987124-0-10020";"Then go. I'll tell the Lieutenant what happened."
"204987124-0-10026";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-10027";"I will end the negotiations."
"204987124-0-10041";"Yes, I collected a few extra amulets."
"204987124-0-10042";"Consider yourself defended."
"204987124-0-10046";"Lead on."
"204987124-0-10055";"I take it they lost?"
"204987124-0-10058";"That sounds horrible."
"204987124-0-10060";"What is my task?"
"204987124-0-10061";"I take it that the Yokudans were one of the conquerors?"
"204987124-0-10066";"What will we be doing?"
"204987124-0-10075";"I am ready to race."
"204987124-0-10079";"What now?"
"204987124-0-10080";"I will do this thing."
"204987124-0-10082";"What are the rules?"
"204987124-0-10084";"I can abide by that, easily."
"204987124-0-10086";"They'll never join your cause. I'll make sure of it."
"204987124-0-10089";"We should duel. It is the honorable choice."
"204987124-0-10090";"I'll sound the drum and start the duel."
"204987124-0-10091";"I'll distract him. You kill him while he's looking the other way."
"204987124-0-10092";"I believe another storm is coming."
"204987124-0-10093";"I'll look for the missing knights on my way to face Angof."
"204987124-0-10105";"More knights? Where?"
"204987124-0-10108";"How do we capture an Imperial picket?"
"204987124-0-10109";"Sir Lanis and the others are nearby. You should meet up with them."
"204987124-0-10111";"Totems? I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-10112";"So I use the cudgel on an <<1>> when he's severly wounded?"
"204987124-0-10114";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-10116";"You should do what you think is right, of course."
"204987124-0-10121";"How did you end up in here?"
"204987124-0-10141";"Why did you come here?"
"204987124-0-10142";"Why are you still here, then?"
"204987124-0-10143";"Who are the King's Guard?"
"204987124-0-10144";"How large is the King's Guard?"
"204987124-0-10145";"What's your role in the King's Guard?"
"204987124-0-10146";"Who is Hadoon?"
"204987124-0-10147";"You need to get back to the others."
"204987124-0-10148";"Go. Quickly."
"204987124-0-10149";"Are you going to continue your research?"
"204987124-0-10150";"Do you really think fate determines every action we take?"
"204987124-0-10152";"And you should heed your own advice."
"204987124-0-10162";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-10163";"Do you want me to look for them?"
"204987124-0-10165";"I'll find the missing patrols and the mage."
"204987124-0-10166";"Tell me more about Gabrielle Benele."
"204987124-0-10167";"Do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-10170";"Why did you kill Sir Etienne? You had already treated his injuries, you could have let him go."
"204987124-0-10174";"What if your proof is one of fate's illusions?"
"204987124-0-10184";"The answer is ""time."""
"204987124-0-10194";"No bribes. Take me to to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-10200";"Show me."
"204987124-0-10205";"Let Sir Lanis know I'm sending anyone else I find to join him."
"204987124-0-10208";"Stun him with a cudgel and tie him up. Got it."
"204987124-0-10215";"Wasn't the local woman,  <<1>>, looking after him?"
"204987124-0-10216";"I'll take a look around."
"204987124-0-10222";"How do I find Foreman Blaise?"
"204987124-0-10223";"How do I find Foreman Blaise?"
"204987124-0-10224";"How do I find Foreman Blaise?"
"204987124-0-10225";"What now?"
"204987124-0-10228";"We'll see, necromancer."
"204987124-0-10238";"Tell me about the creature."
"204987124-0-10239";"Tell me about the trap."
"204987124-0-10240";"Tell me about the creature."
"204987124-0-10241";"Tell me about the creature."
"204987124-0-10243";"Act? What's the next step?"
"204987124-0-10244";"How is a riddle useful to me right now?"
"204987124-0-10245";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-10246";"Please, tell me the riddle again."
"204987124-0-10247";"Release the eternal darkness and come forth!"
"204987124-0-10251";"An Imperial spy I discovered in your camp wrote about it in his journal."
"204987124-0-10252";"Never mind that. We need to stop this raid."
"204987124-0-10254";"We need to stop this raid."
"204987124-0-10255";"It must be the enemy raid!"
"204987124-0-10256";"Wait! Stay here and help me protect the supplies."
"204987124-0-10271";"I will get the Bonerender. Is there anything that I can do to help you?"
"204987124-0-10278";"What is this place, anyway?"
"204987124-0-10279";"<<1>>'s free now."
"204987124-0-10280";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-10286";"Will the key that I used to free Snaruga work for them too?"
"204987124-0-10294";"What does Sir Lanis want?"
"204987124-0-10299";"I'll take <<a:1>>."
"204987124-0-10300";"What makes a good racing lizard?"
"204987124-0-10301";"I'll take <<a:1>>."
"204987124-0-10302";"How much does it cost?"
"204987124-0-10306";"She murdered you?"
"204987124-0-10307";"I'll give her the cursed gemstones. Find peace, spirit."
"204987124-0-10333";"So what does he want?"
"204987124-0-10335";"Are you the commander of the Militia?"
"204987124-0-10336";"He was killed by your own allies?"
"204987124-0-10337";"You're safe enough in the camp."
"204987124-0-10338";"Aren't you a soldier?"
"204987124-0-10339";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-10340";"You seem nervous."
"204987124-0-10341";"You're safe enough in the camp."
"204987124-0-10342";"Aren't you a soldier?"
"204987124-0-10348";"Virgil and Nicolas were working with the Imperials in exchange for food."
"204987124-0-10367";"He sent me to free you."
"204987124-0-10372";"Why do you want to kill <<1>>? He said you were friends."
"204987124-0-10387";"How did you get infected?"
"204987124-0-10400";"Not all of it. I did bring you a meal, though. I hope stew is all right."
"204987124-0-10401";"I agree with that. I'll see what I can do about the ropes."
"204987124-0-10402";"It was an honest offer. You don't have to be offended by it."
"204987124-0-10403";"So you don't want the fingers? Fine. Let's test these thumbscrews."
"204987124-0-10404";"Calm down, friend. You still have another hand. Are you ready to talk?"
"204987124-0-10405";"Sure. I'll tremble in fear if you ever get out of those ropes. Will you answer my questions?"
"204987124-0-10407";"It's no such thing! Speaking of a meal, I was able to get you some stew."
"204987124-0-10408";"All I want is for you to see reason and answer a few questions."
"204987124-0-10409";"I agree with that. I'll see what I can do about the ropes."
"204987124-0-10410";"I brought you a bowl of stew. I can guarantee there's no poison."
"204987124-0-10411";"It was an honest offer. You don't need to be offended by that."
"204987124-0-10412";"It's not wise to insult a torturer who's holding a pair of thumbscrews."
"204987124-0-10413";"Calm down, friend. You still have another hand. Are you ready to talk?"
"204987124-0-10414";"Sure. I'll tremble in fear if you ever get out of those ropes. Are you ready to answer my questions?"
"204987124-0-10415";"Let's see how creative these thumbscrews make you."
"204987124-0-10416";"All I want is for you to answer our questions."
"204987124-0-10422";"I won't let you die. The mages will keep you alive so I can keep hurting you."
"204987124-0-10423";"I'm glad you've decided to see reason."
"204987124-0-10424";"If we can take the garrison quickly, fewer will die. I'm sure of that."
"204987124-0-10425";"I don't want to do anything to you. All I want is for you to talk to me."
"204987124-0-10426";"Didn't you bring enough supplies?"
"204987124-0-10433";"<Remove the journal.>"
"204987124-0-10438";"Why in the world did they bring you along?"
"204987124-0-10439";"Keep Capture"
"204987124-0-10448";"You think they're planning something here in Stormhaven?"
"204987124-0-10449";"What do you know about Vaermina?"
"204987124-0-10456";"I killed the Dominion commander."
"204987124-0-10459";"What can you tell me about the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-10460";"Why would they do that?"
"204987124-0-10461";"Why aren't there many veterans in the army?"
"204987124-0-10462";"How many soldiers are in the garrison?"
"204987124-0-10463";"Why aren't there many veterans in the army?"
"204987124-0-10464";"Didn't you bring enough supplies?"
"204987124-0-10465";"Have the Colovians always waged war with necromancy?"
"204987124-0-10471";"What about their armor?"
"204987124-0-10472";"How do you fight?"
"204987124-0-10473";"What unit do you command?"
"204987124-0-10474";"Where is Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-10475";"What is the Gallantry?"
"204987124-0-10476";"Where is Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-10485";"I don't understand what you're saying."
"204987124-0-10486";"I'll try to find something to help me understand you."
"204987124-0-10496";"Be careful getting out of here."
"204987124-0-10497";"Maybe the curse should stand."
"204987124-0-10498";"Your guards don't frighten me. The curse must remain in effect."
"204987124-0-10503";"Get to safety. I'll find Cecile."
"204987124-0-10505";"I found the others. They should be back at camp."
"204987124-0-10514";"He's working with them?"
"204987124-0-10515";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-10523";"Why did she marry King Eamond?"
"204987124-0-10524";"Let's talk about the murder scene."
"204987124-0-10526";"How did you meet her?"
"204987124-0-10527";"How did you come to be here then?"
"204987124-0-10528";"Why did she marry King Eamond?"
"204987124-0-10530";"Maybe this will be a lesson to you."
"204987124-0-10532";"Do I look like I'm part of the Legion?"
"204987124-0-10535";"And what would that be?"
"204987124-0-10556";"I talked to Ildani. She's right up the hill."
"204987124-0-10559";"Sure. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-10560";"[Lie] Sure thing. Go get her. You can count on me."
"204987124-0-10564";"Sounds like a good plan. I'll do it."
"204987124-0-10565";"I could deliver the goods for you."
"204987124-0-10567";"I'll deliver the goods and meet you there."
"204987124-0-10568";"How will I know I'm speaking to the right person?"
"204987124-0-10570";"Yes, here it is."
"204987124-0-10571";"Yes, I believe this package is for you."
"204987124-0-10572";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-10606";"Is this Ayleid energy dangerous?"
"204987124-0-10607";"Weren't the Nereid and her followers here first?"
"204987124-0-10611";"Weren't the Nereid and her followers here first?"
"204987124-0-10612";"Yes, I'll help you and the Primeval Seekers."
"204987124-0-10613";"Yes, I'll help you and the Primeval Seekers."
"204987124-0-10614";"Why is Giblets here?"
"204987124-0-10624";"[Lie] No, not me, but there's a suspicious Khajiit downstairs."
"204987124-0-10634";"Why were you trapped in that container?"
"204987124-0-10643";"Here you are."
"204987124-0-10646";"Your brothers bound you here?"
"204987124-0-10650";"That war is long over. The Alessians lost."
"204987124-0-10651";"<Take the pendant.>"
"204987124-0-10653";"You should pass on to Aetherius. The time of the Ayleids is over."
"204987124-0-10658";"Once I have the lizard, what do I do?"
"204987124-0-10659";"What can remove its dishonor?"
"204987124-0-10663";"Will you take it back?"
"204987124-0-10668";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-10669";"Why would they attack here?"
"204987124-0-10671";"You're a bandit?"
"204987124-0-10682";"I'll destroy the artifacts and set you free."
"204987124-0-10689";"You think Faolchu and the Bloodthorns are working together?"
"204987124-0-10690";"Start Defend NPC"
"204987124-0-10695";"ActionList 17868 - Follow me."
"204987124-0-10699";"How can we get one?"
"204987124-0-10701";"Is that what you want?"
"204987124-0-10713";"What are her purposes here?"
"204987124-0-10714";"How does she plan to do that?"
"204987124-0-10715";"The Primeval Seekers say you're breaking the laws of nature."
"204987124-0-10719";"You're ready to create the Water Stone?"
"204987124-0-10720";"Of course. Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-10721";"Where is the sanctum?"
"204987124-0-10723";"Child."
"204987124-0-10725";"A child that cleans up on a condition increment."
"204987124-0-10728";"A follower that fights with me and runs away when combat ends."
"204987124-0-10729";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-10731";"How?"
"204987124-0-10733";"Can we escort them out of here?"
"204987124-0-10735";"I'll get one for each of the surviving knights."
"204987124-0-10746";"Were you frightened?"
"204987124-0-10747";"Why do you have a camp way out here?"
"204987124-0-10749";"I'll speak to Commander Ales."
"204987124-0-10768";"I'll search the room and be right back."
"204987124-0-10773";"Why? Won't that kill your disciples too?"
"204987124-0-10775";"No. She says she's going to flood the ruins."
"204987124-0-10784";"Yes."
"204987124-0-10788";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-10803";"I am."
"204987124-0-10804";"Where can I find the ore?"
"204987124-0-10805";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-10807";"A difficult time on the road then?"
"204987124-0-10808";"What is going on at the shipyards?"
"204987124-0-10809";"Yes."
"204987124-0-10812";"I am."
"204987124-0-10814";"Here. Take the Water Stone."
"204987124-0-10816";"I do."
"204987124-0-10818";"I want to be a Forester."
"204987124-0-10831";"Do you worry that you might be attacked?"
"204987124-0-10837";"What will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-10856";"I'll save Amil's family."
"204987124-0-10858";"Tell me why you were skulking around before I break something. You, for example."
"204987124-0-10859";"Care to find out?"
"204987124-0-10860";"I'll just take yours."
"204987124-0-10861";"Just by disrupting their meeting?"
"204987124-0-10867";"I'll rescue your family if you tell me what you know."
"204987124-0-10870";"Where can I find the Dominion commander?"
"204987124-0-10875";"What else is involved?"
"204987124-0-10876";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-10877";"What else do Foresters craft?"
"204987124-0-10883";"I'd like to join the Smith's guild."
"204987124-0-10886";"I'll join the Runecrafter's guild."
"204987124-0-10889";"I will join the Forester's guild."
"204987124-0-10895";"How can I force them apart?"
"204987124-0-10897";"Are you going to tell me what you're thinking or not?"
"204987124-0-10899";"Why is the Dominion interested in the tower?"

"204987124-0-10904";"Interesting. Enjoy the wine."
"204987124-0-10912";"One can join us and be one of many."
"204987124-0-10914";"Two loudmouths?"
"204987124-0-10916";"I'll look into what you've told me."
"204987124-0-10920";"Is keeping quiet honorable? Stand up and fight!"
"204987124-0-10923";"Will it work?"
"204987124-0-10924";"All right."
"204987124-0-10925";"Do you have any evidence?"
"204987124-0-10926";"Do you have any evidence?"
"204987124-0-10930";"Are you saying that <<1>> is near?"
"204987124-0-10931";"You should come back to the camp. It's safer there."
"204987124-0-10940";"Where are the paths to avoid Imperials?"
"204987124-0-10942";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-10948";"What about the western side of the town?"
"204987124-0-10949";"Disguises aren't foolproof."
"204987124-0-10953";"Where can I find a disguise?"
"204987124-0-10955";"Where are the paths to avoid Imperials?"
"204987124-0-10967";"Is your mother all right?"
"204987124-0-10973";"Secret tunnel? You need to tell me where the secret tunnel is!"
"204987124-0-10974";"Show me where the tunnel is."
"204987124-0-10984";"I'll look into what you've told me."
"204987124-0-11006";"Yes."
"204987124-0-11008";"Yes."
"204987124-0-11010";"I do."
"204987124-0-11033";"Why were you always up on the platform?"
"204987124-0-11035";"Who took your wife and daughter?"
"204987124-0-11036";"And what do you see from up there?"
"204987124-0-11037";"What about out to sea?"
"204987124-0-11074";"Angof who?"
"204987124-0-11076";"Yes. How do you know so much about Angof?"
"204987124-0-11077";"So your father told you about Angof?"
"204987124-0-11078";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-11089";"<Place the Warrior tile.>"
"204987124-0-11118";"We'll find you."
"204987124-0-11119";"I doubt that very much."
"204987124-0-11128";"I'll look into what you've told me."
"204987124-0-11150";"Tell me about the Fell's Brigade."
"204987124-0-11170";"Yes. I will avenge them."
"204987124-0-11220";"I collected the weapons Gennove asked for."
"204987124-0-11221";"Bloodfiends? Is that what did this?"
"204987124-0-11231";"<Prepare to defend the mammoth!>"
"204987124-0-11233";"Can't the mammoths protect themselves?"
"204987124-0-11234";"Why do the tigers fear the patriarch?"
"204987124-0-11235";"Can't the mammoths protect themselves?"
"204987124-0-11243";"Why would a Redguard betray his own?"
"204987124-0-11244";"Who are your suspects?"
"204987124-0-11245";"Here. Take their ashes."
"204987124-0-11246";"Can you tell me more about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-11247";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-11248";"Act now? What happened?"
"204987124-0-11251";"What news should I bring to Ufa?"
"204987124-0-11252";"You think she's innocent?"
"204987124-0-11253";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-11255";"I'll go to the warehouse."
"204987124-0-11273";"This town belongs to <<1>> and the Redguard people."
"204987124-0-11275";"You can try."
"204987124-0-11276";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-11277";"Once he's dead, I'll find you."
"204987124-0-11303";"Guards are everywhere. Is there an easy way to get to your scouts?"
"204987124-0-11304";"And the second suspect?"
"204987124-0-11308";"Perhaps a few coins will loosen your tongue?"
"204987124-0-11315";"I'll let Ufa know."
"204987124-0-11316";"I'll let Ufa know."
"204987124-0-11352";"Yes, I'm ready now."
"204987124-0-11366";"But can you make the antidote?"
"204987124-0-11368";"What do I do with this?"
"204987124-0-11370";"What do I do after that?"
"204987124-0-11371";"Sorry to bother you. I'll let you keep digging."
"204987124-0-11390";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-11423";"What are the dreugh doing here?"
"204987124-0-11424";"So Conele wants to unleash a Brother of Strife?"
"204987124-0-11425";"Who is Ahknara?"
"204987124-0-11430";"How do we stop this Alexandra Conele?"
"204987124-0-11433";"I have some things to do. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-11437";"Let Sir Lanis know I'll send anyone else I find to join him."
"204987124-0-11441";"What is she planning?"
"204987124-0-11443";"You have a different plan, then?"
"204987124-0-11445";"I'll consider your words, Reesa."
"204987124-0-11447";"The sergeant asked me to speak with you. You have a plan to deal with them?"
"204987124-0-11449";"The sergeant wanted me to speak to Reesa before deciding."
"204987124-0-11460";"What have you learned?"
"204987124-0-11471";"Why don't you believe him?"
"204987124-0-11472";"I'll find <<1>> and your daughter."
"204987124-0-11473";"There was an eruption. Couldn't that be the reason?"
"204987124-0-11474";"Aren't we all allies now?"
"204987124-0-11478";"Girvas thinks you've taken his daughter."
"204987124-0-11479";"And leave you behind?"
"204987124-0-11482";"Is that where she is?"
"204987124-0-11486";"What's this?"
"204987124-0-11487";"I'll keep you safe."
"204987124-0-11492";"The Argonians must still resent that."
"204987124-0-11494";"So the former slaveholders are having trouble adjusting."
"204987124-0-11495";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-11496";"Why me? Can you apply it?"
"204987124-0-11499";"That's all? Just heal people?"
"204987124-0-11500";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-11502";"What do you need done?"
"204987124-0-11504";"Where is she right now then?"
"204987124-0-11505";"I'm ready. We'll defeat her together."
"204987124-0-11511";"You don't hate the Dark Elves, then?"
"204987124-0-11513";"Can you speak to the mistrust between the Argonians and the Dark Elves?"
"204987124-0-11514";"Why are you out here?"
"204987124-0-11516";"Your father is very worried."
"204987124-0-11522";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-11523";"The Dunmer enslaved the Argonians?"
"204987124-0-11525";"How did they justify this?"
"204987124-0-11526";"Furon's right. We should enslave the army."
"204987124-0-11527";"What do you know about Ahknara?"
"204987124-0-11528";"Did the reinforcements arrive?"
"204987124-0-11530";"Yes, Sergeant."
"204987124-0-11532";"Yes, Sergeant."
"204987124-0-11533";"Tell me about Fort Arand."
"204987124-0-11534";"Ahknara?"
"204987124-0-11536";"Were they able to close the portal?"
"204987124-0-11539";"Did anything crawl up from below?"
"204987124-0-11543";"Why do you hate Argonians so much?"
"204987124-0-11545";"Argonians killed your wife?"
"204987124-0-11546";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-11547";"What can you tell me about the relic?"
"204987124-0-11552";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-11553";"Who is Vivec?"
"204987124-0-11554";"Who were the Akaviri?"
"204987124-0-11555";"That doesn't sound like a ""mine."""
"204987124-0-11556";"This doesn't seem like a ""mine."""
"204987124-0-11557";"What's cuttle used for?"
"204987124-0-11560";"Got something in mind?"
"204987124-0-11563";"And what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-11564";"I'll cut you loose."
"204987124-0-11575";"I'm glad I could help."
"204987124-0-11576";"Holgunn's told me about the siege. How can I help?"
"204987124-0-11577";"<Continue reading.>"
"204987124-0-11580";"Be at peace, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-11583";"What were you doing here?"
"204987124-0-11584";"What did you find?"
"204987124-0-11585";"What were you doing here?"
"204987124-0-11586";"Why can't I just take or destroy your skull?"
"204987124-0-11591";"You don't think they can help?"
"204987124-0-11596";"These Covenant plans speak of assassins infiltrating the fort."
"204987124-0-11598";"I could search the camp for their plans."
"204987124-0-11599";"I can catch him and end the threat."
"204987124-0-11601";"That's a difficult choice. What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-11604";"I'll kill the ashkhan, and stop the Vereansu once and for all."
"204987124-0-11606";"I'll make sure you find peace."
"204987124-0-11608";"Is anyone looking into the disappearances?"

"204987124-0-11614";"What do you think is happening here?"
"204987124-0-11618";"He said a witch took his axe. And his pants."
"204987124-0-11620";"I said I'd find the axe. Any idea where I should look?"
"204987124-0-11621";"I found some money left to him by his father."
"204987124-0-11622";"What must be done?"
"204987124-0-11625";"Here you are, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-11627";"So, where to than?"
"204987124-0-11628";"How do we stop an army?"
"204987124-0-11630";"Won't we be trapped inside?"
"204987124-0-11643";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-11645";"The Chimer were losing?"
"204987124-0-11648";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-11650";"Have the guards made any progress?"
"204987124-0-11651";"Perhaps I could help."
"204987124-0-11652";"What were you and Giron arguing about?"
"204987124-0-11653";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-11654";"What can you tell me about Narsis?"
"204987124-0-11655";"Where's the rest of your house?"
"204987124-0-11656";"What were you and Giron arguing about?"
"204987124-0-11665";"Can you return to the family's stead?"
"204987124-0-11667";"Can you return to the family's stead?"
"204987124-0-11670";"I'm ready. Go."
"204987124-0-11675";"I'll do as you ask."
"204987124-0-11677";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-11679";"Consider it done."
"204987124-0-11685";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-11686";"Will she be all right?"
"204987124-0-11687";"Calm down. Who stabbed her?"
"204987124-0-11688";"I'll get the antidote from him. Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-11691";"Who is Leel-Vata?"
"204987124-0-11693";"I'll find Leel-Vata."
"204987124-0-11694";"Perhaps I can help."
"204987124-0-11695";"I'll find your lost relics."
"204987124-0-11697";"I'll find your lost relics."
"204987124-0-11702";"What look?"
"204987124-0-11703";"Performance?"
"204987124-0-11704";"Shame?"
"204987124-0-11706";"Eanen didn't care for you. Your relationship was just a game to him."
"204987124-0-11712";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-11714";"Here's the axe. I found it in a house surrounded by plague husks."
"204987124-0-11715";"Speaking of loud, I think I hear your wife coming now."
"204987124-0-11717";"Very well. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-11719";"What do you know about the monster?"
"204987124-0-11720";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-11723";"What about your belongings? Don't you want them back?"
"204987124-0-11726";"I'll find a way to stop you."
"204987124-0-11728";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-11729";"Where can I find the sorceress you mentioned?"

"204987124-0-11732";"Seeks-the-Night is your brother?"
"204987124-0-11733";"Where do I find the sorceress you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-11734";"I'll speak to your son."
"204987124-0-11735";"How can we make him return?"
"204987124-0-11737";"I'll do it."
"204987124-0-11739";"I saved everyone I could. It's time to go."
"204987124-0-11740";"I've got your back."
"204987124-0-11741";"All right. Let's go to the monastery."
"204987124-0-11742";"I'll crush the eggs, Gar."
"204987124-0-11750";"Why are the candle and skull significant?"
"204987124-0-11753";"Why is it so important to trade with the Mabrigash?"
"204987124-0-11754";"And to you too, I'm sure."
"204987124-0-11762";"The gift is merely a token of goodwill."
"204987124-0-11765";"That sounds convenient. Can you show me the way?"
"204987124-0-11768";"What do you think it means?"
"204987124-0-11769";"Why are the ghosts called serpentbound?"
"204987124-0-11771";"Will you meet with Raston?"
"204987124-0-11772";"I'm just passing through, and <<1>> is just a merchant."
"204987124-0-11773";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-11776";"<Read further.>"
"204987124-0-11777";"How can I help, Garyn?"
"204987124-0-11778";"I can help you back to your men."
"204987124-0-11779";"Why did you charge ahead of your men?"
"204987124-0-11780";"I can help you back to your men."
"204987124-0-11781";"Why did you charge ahead of your men?"
"204987124-0-11782";"I will. Thanks."
"204987124-0-11784";"Stay here. I'll be back soon."
"204987124-0-11790";"Wrong crates?"
"204987124-0-11793";"And you think I'm already attuned?"
"204987124-0-11794";"His spirit may be wandering somewhere. You should forget him. Go on with your life."
"204987124-0-11795";"To the southwest. On the left side of the stairs."
"204987124-0-11796";"You must accept this. He and his wife were laughing at you."
"204987124-0-11797";"Tell me about your master."
"204987124-0-11798";"What does he write?"
"204987124-0-11800";"<Turn the page.>"
"204987124-0-11802";"<Turn the page.>"
"204987124-0-11803";"Any idea where he might be?"
"204987124-0-11805";"Want me to look for him?"
"204987124-0-11808";"I'm working for Councilor Ralden and this looks rather suspicious."
"204987124-0-11810";"Hired by who?"
"204987124-0-11812";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-11813";"The Mabrigash asked me to seek your counsel."
"204987124-0-11815";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-11816";"Tell me about the Argonians."
"204987124-0-11817";"Let's talk about the Nords. What's their issue?"
"204987124-0-11818";"Tell me about the Argonians."
"204987124-0-11819";"Tell me about the Argonians."
"204987124-0-11822";"You sound like you regret what's happened."
"204987124-0-11823";"Run!"
"204987124-0-11826";"Combine them in the urn. Got it."
"204987124-0-11829";"Tell me about the shipment or rot here. Your choice."
"204987124-0-11830";"And?"
"204987124-0-11831";"Tell me about the shipment or rot here. Your choice."
"204987124-0-11834";"Who was this Dark Elf?"
"204987124-0-11835";"It sounds like none of the Argonians actually saw the Dres, the boat, or the poison."
"204987124-0-11836";"Who was the Dark Elf who claimed the Dres poisoned the Hist?"
"204987124-0-11837";"Why would the Dres do this?"
"204987124-0-11838";"Won't the Vale change if they choose to give up their isolation?"
"204987124-0-11839";"I'm ready to go back now."
"204987124-0-11843";"What was he doing to the Hist?"
"204987124-0-11845";"Let me speak to him."
"204987124-0-11846";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-11849";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-11851";"What happens to Raston if I burn the totem?"
"204987124-0-11853";"Would it be so bad for the Mabrigash to become less isolated?"
"204987124-0-11861";"You'll benefit from trade, too."
"204987124-0-11863";"Why are your sons lost, then?"
"204987124-0-11864";"Where should I look for your sons?"
"204987124-0-11865";"I'm just trying to help."
"204987124-0-11867";"How do we open the portal again?"
"204987124-0-11869";"Great."
"204987124-0-11871";"I'm ready to face whatever is there."
"204987124-0-11873";"What if I pay you? Will that buy me a few words?"
"204987124-0-11875";"Please, tell me."
"204987124-0-11877";"Star is a cat?"
"204987124-0-11878";"You know where the missing villagers are?"
"204987124-0-11879";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-11880";"What do you intend to do?"
"204987124-0-11881";"I know you want to help, but attacking the guards …."
"204987124-0-11882";"Where can I get weapons?"
"204987124-0-11885";"They discovered where the missing villagers are being held, but Madras won't give me the location."
"204987124-0-11887";"Did you find out where the missing people are?"
"204987124-0-11889";"You … tasted the tree?"
"204987124-0-11890";"I'm here to help."
"204987124-0-11891";"And what do I do while you're distracting the guards?"
"204987124-0-11893";"And then?"
"204987124-0-11896";"You had a bottle. What was in it?"
"204987124-0-11897";"What was that about a Brother of Strife? I just came from imprisoning Balreth."
"204987124-0-11899";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-11900";"Will he be punished?"
"204987124-0-11901";"What will you do with <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-11902";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-11904";"What are you suggesting?"
"204987124-0-11907";"What did drinking the Hist sap do to him?"
"204987124-0-11908";"How do you know that?"
"204987124-0-11909";"Why are you helping me?"
"204987124-0-11910";"<Show Naryu what you found.>"
"204987124-0-11911";"Who are you after?"
"204987124-0-11912";"What organization do you belong to?"
"204987124-0-11913";"Where's Giron?"
"204987124-0-11916";"I'll find them. How do I get inside?"
"204987124-0-11920";"What were they doing?"
"204987124-0-11921";"Giron is dead. Stay here with the others while I get help."
"204987124-0-11923";"Giron used the captured villagers to strengthen the Llodos plague. He bled them into the lake."
"204987124-0-11924";"Anything else you need from me?"
"204987124-0-11926";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-11929";"Vox?"
"204987124-0-11930";"Hang on, Councilor."
"204987124-0-11932";"Giron used captured villagers to strengthen the Llodos plague. He bled them into the lake."
"204987124-0-11934";"Anything else you need from me?"
"204987124-0-11940";"I hope you learned something from this experience."
"204987124-0-11945";"Not like who?"
"204987124-0-11946";"Why did he want you to leave?"
"204987124-0-11947";"That does sound suspicious."
"204987124-0-11948";"What's a kwama?"
"204987124-0-11964";"What else is involved?"
"204987124-0-11968";"I'd like to join the Smith's guild."
"204987124-0-11972";"What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-11975";"What do I do, Henrik?"
"204987124-0-11977";"But I lost the sword."
"204987124-0-11978";"Is that why you killed your troops?"
"204987124-0-11979";"Did you burn these bodies?"
"204987124-0-11981";"Is there anything more?"
"204987124-0-11982";"Who is Almalexia?"
"204987124-0-11983";"That can't be all."
"204987124-0-11984";"What message does Almalexia have for Sildras?"
"204987124-0-11985";"Are you saying Sotha Sil doesn't care?"
"204987124-0-11986";"Who is Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-11987";"It only leaves more questions."
"204987124-0-11988";"Sildras wants to know if the Tribunal hears his prayers."
"204987124-0-11989";"What was the question in his heart?"
"204987124-0-11990";"Who is Vivec?"
"204987124-0-11991";"Get moving, and be careful."
"204987124-0-11993";"Go, and go quickly."
"204987124-0-11995";"You'd best be running."
"204987124-0-11997";"What were their objections to your marriage?"
"204987124-0-11998";"I've come to offer you aid. How can I help?"
"204987124-0-11999";"Haven't you noticed how strange the General's been acting? I'm just trying to help him."
"204987124-0-12001";"I'll be quick."
"204987124-0-12002";"I'll be quick."
"204987124-0-12004";"You seem surprised I asked."
"204987124-0-12005";"What can I do to get you to free Senil?"
"204987124-0-12007";"First, the information."
"204987124-0-12008";"<Read the second scroll.>"
"204987124-0-12009";"Here. Take it."
"204987124-0-12010";"These documents look suspicious. I should inform the Captain and talk to this retainer."
"204987124-0-12011";"<<1>> wonders why the Tribunal is silent."
"204987124-0-12013";"Aren't the Nords part of the Pact?"
"204987124-0-12015";"All right. I'll look into it."
"204987124-0-12016";"He wants me to expose you."
"204987124-0-12017";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-12018";"You certainly don't seem like a spy to me."
"204987124-0-12019";"Why have the Maulborn occupied the pass?"
"204987124-0-12020";"His messenger said he knows you are strong enough to bear your tasks."
"204987124-0-12023";"What did you do wrong?"
"204987124-0-12024";"He said not to worry about your true concern: that he is not what he once was."
"204987124-0-12026";"I saw a decree on the General's desk. He intends to execute you for insubordination."
"204987124-0-12027";"What is this Dark Elf's name?"
"204987124-0-12028";"Did this Dark Elf have any proof?"
"204987124-0-12029";"Interesting. The beasts surrounding the shrines were drawn there by piles of offal."
"204987124-0-12030";"How do I stop them?"
"204987124-0-12032";"If I steal those manifests, they won't be able to bring the plague into the city."
"204987124-0-12033";"<Take the scroll.>"
"204987124-0-12039";"I wonder who is more pliable, the person with a broken skull, or the one without?"
"204987124-0-12052";"A Dark Elf named <<1>> was somehow involved each time."
"204987124-0-12053";"Perhaps. What would you like me to do?"
"204987124-0-12054";"You look like a Foozle man to me."
"204987124-0-12055";"What kind of spell?"
"204987124-0-12057";"Very well. Cast your spell."
"204987124-0-12060";"Okay… and dare I ask about the Woozle?"
"204987124-0-12061";"Why do you want the Foozle again?"
"204987124-0-12062";"Yep. You don't look so tough to me."
"204987124-0-12067";"Tell me about why you want the Foozle again."
"204987124-0-12068";"So, you'll continue to allow these soldiers to terrorize the fort?"
"204987124-0-12069";"Maybe I can help."
"204987124-0-12075";"I'm ready to take the Trial of the Heart."
"204987124-0-12077";"Where should I look for the surviving scouts?"
"204987124-0-12078";"Why was Balreth bound?"
"204987124-0-12079";"What's so important about this piece of coral?"
"204987124-0-12080";"I'll find <<1>> and your soldiers."
"204987124-0-12084";"That doesn't sound like Tanval Indoril."
"204987124-0-12086";"<Close the book.>"
"204987124-0-12091";"How can I get inside the barracks?"
"204987124-0-12095";"Would some coin change your mind?"
"204987124-0-12097";"I'll meet you in the grandmaster's chamber."
"204987124-0-12102";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-12103";"Tell me where I should start."
"204987124-0-12107";"I'll prove it to you with this idol."
"204987124-0-12108";"Who would want to harm Arilen?"
"204987124-0-12109";"Who would want to cause him harm?"
"204987124-0-12110";"<<1>> asked me to look into her death."
"204987124-0-12117";"<Examine the notes.>"
"204987124-0-12119";"<Examine the notes.>"
"204987124-0-12120";"<Examine the notes.>"
"204987124-0-12124";"I'll recover the <<z:1>>."
"204987124-0-12125";"Where can I get one?"
"204987124-0-12127";"I'll escort you back."
"204987124-0-12130";"I'll speak with <<1>>."
"204987124-0-12131";"Without the curse, would your village have survived?"
"204987124-0-12132";"I'll meet him there."
"204987124-0-12135";"Argonian? What Argonian?"
"204987124-0-12136";"Why don't you retrieve the artifact yourselves?"
"204987124-0-12137";"So you'll free him and put a stop to this?"
"204987124-0-12139";"Tell me about the curse."
"204987124-0-12140";"You saw what I did to your friends. Do you think I'm not serious?"
"204987124-0-12142";"I see. What is the next trial?"
"204987124-0-12143";"I see. What is the next trial?"
"204987124-0-12144";"I see. What is the next trial?"
"204987124-0-12145";"I already taught your friends a lesson. Tell me what I want to know."
"204987124-0-12146";"One of your Wood Elf friends said the same thing before I killed him."
"204987124-0-12153";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-12155";"<Read the journal.>"
"204987124-0-12160";"Thank you, Seneschal."
"204987124-0-12161";"Couldn't you just tell me how you bound Balreth?"
"204987124-0-12164";"I see. What is the next trial?"
"204987124-0-12167";"Then how did the Worm Cult defeat you?"
"204987124-0-12169";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-12171";"Give me the poison."
"204987124-0-12173";"<Look around for records.>"
"204987124-0-12175";"<<1>> and <<2>> called it a curse."
"204987124-0-12176";"Yes. <<1>> wanted me to bring that back to her."
"204987124-0-12183";"Do the other villagers want to remain this way?"
"204987124-0-12184";"And if they don't?"
"204987124-0-12185";"You don't mind being a skeleton?"
"204987124-0-12190";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-12197";"I'll free the prisoners."
"204987124-0-12200";"I'll find Sings-With-Reed and meet you in the heart chamber."
"204987124-0-12210";"What's a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-12212";"Ruvali blames you for the death of her husband. Are you sure it's a good idea to speak with her?"
"204987124-0-12213";"Ra-shadda must pay for his crimes."
"204987124-0-12216";"I am ready."
"204987124-0-12220";"So tell me what's going on down here."
"204987124-0-12221";"Tell me everything or you die right here and now."
"204987124-0-12222";"What simulacrum and where can I find it?"
"204987124-0-12225";"Get out of here before I change my mind. <Let the retainer live.>"
"204987124-0-12226";"Omalor had something? What kind of something?"
"204987124-0-12228";"That's not up to me."
"204987124-0-12230";"The Maulborn set up a base in the ruins below the fortress."
"204987124-0-12232";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-12233";"Sounds interesting."
"204987124-0-12235";"Yes."
"204987124-0-12237";"Yes."
"204987124-0-12240";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-12241";"How do you think we should handle this?"
"204987124-0-12243";"I'll see if I can find him."
"204987124-0-12246";"How do I perform research?"
"204987124-0-12249";"Where can I get one?"
"204987124-0-12251";"What must I do to become an apprentice?"
"204987124-0-12253";"I am."
"204987124-0-12259";"Yes."
"204987124-0-12261";"How do we stop this one?"
"204987124-0-12264";"What's a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-12269";"Then I'll rouse Hissmir's true power. It will work, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-12271";"Yes, let's go."
"204987124-0-12273";"Where is she now?"
"204987124-0-12279";"Answer my question before things get nasty."
"204987124-0-12281";"All right, take the book. I'll see you back at the fort."
"204987124-0-12284";"<Open the cage.>"
"204987124-0-12285";"<Open the cage.>"
"204987124-0-12288";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-12289";"I want to join the Forester's guild."
"204987124-0-12291";"What else do Foresters craft?"
"204987124-0-12294";"I will join the Forester's guild."
"204987124-0-12296";"Between the Vereansu and the plague husks, it's not safe here."
"204987124-0-12302";"I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's an urgent matter to discuss."
"204987124-0-12304";"Thank you for your time, Grandmaster."
"204987124-0-12316";"I want to brave the dangers of the river."
"204987124-0-12322";"I want to brave the dangers of the river."
"204987124-0-12327";"How can I free him?"
"204987124-0-12330";"We have a deal. Where should I start looking?"
"204987124-0-12331";"What can I do to get you to free Senil?"
"204987124-0-12333";"Why did you attack the caravan?"
"204987124-0-12334";"Thank Ragna. She knew something was wrong and convinced me to look into it."
"204987124-0-12339";"Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-12341";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-12344";"I'm afraid not. You either face the constructs or face me."
"204987124-0-12347";"You're hesitating. Did you take the relics? Out with it!"
"204987124-0-12349";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-12351";"Thank you for your help."
"204987124-0-12354";"Why is it so important to trade with the Mabrigash?"
"204987124-0-12355";"Is there really a Ghost Snake?"
"204987124-0-12360";"Why is this tribe so isolated?"
"204987124-0-12362";"I never mentioned relics."
"204987124-0-12367";"I destroyed the arcane wards protecting them from the plague. That might help."
"204987124-0-12368";"I'll protect the archers while they do their work."
"204987124-0-12369";"Any ideas?"
"204987124-0-12370";"So they just wander here forever?"
"204987124-0-12379";"I need more information before I decide."
"204987124-0-12381";"The Mabrigash are concerned about outsider influence."
"204987124-0-12385";"How would I destroy the <<z:1>>?"
"204987124-0-12386";"What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-12389";"I'll destroy it and free <<1>> from the curse."
"204987124-0-12390";"How would I preserve the <<z:1>>?"
"204987124-0-12392";"I'll preserve it and protect <<1>> from necromantic control."
"204987124-0-12393";"You don't want to attack the Ashkhan directly?"
"204987124-0-12394";"Then what end do you hope to see?"
"204987124-0-12396";"Tested how?"
"204987124-0-12397";"I'll try your talisman."
"204987124-0-12399";"But what goes into it, besides the gizzards?"
"204987124-0-12400";"Why did you try to tame wasps?"
"204987124-0-12403";"<Add six gizzards, six troll fat lumps, and six pinches of wisplight powder.>"
"204987124-0-12407";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-12409";"What do you think I should do?"
"204987124-0-12411";"Not everyone here would agree with you."
"204987124-0-12413";"Are they bound to this place forever?"
"204987124-0-12414";"I'm just passing through, and <<1>> is just a merchant."
"204987124-0-12416";"The what?"
"204987124-0-12417";"What should I do when I run out of draughts?"
"204987124-0-12419";"I want to be a Forester."
"204987124-0-12423";"What else is involved?"
"204987124-0-12426";"I'd like to join the Smith's guild."
"204987124-0-12427";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-12430";"I'll join the Runecrafter's guild."
"204987124-0-12431";"I will take the Trial of the Mind."
"204987124-0-12449";"Do you administer the Trial of the Fang?"
"204987124-0-12451";"Why didn't you move against Giron earlier?"
"204987124-0-12452";"Who are you, really?"
"204987124-0-12453";"You said the constructs turned on the raiders?"
"204987124-0-12454";"I'll see if she'll talk to me."
"204987124-0-12455";"House Dres?"
"204987124-0-12456";"I'll speak with <<1>>."
"204987124-0-12474";"I'll cut you loose. Hold still."
"204987124-0-12475";"<Continue reading.>"
"204987124-0-12479";"There are Worm Cultists in your village?"
"204987124-0-12480";"<Keep reading.>"
"204987124-0-12482";"I'll take care of them."
"204987124-0-12490";"You should go."
"204987124-0-12491";"What work? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-12493";"It seems you have something to hide, spirit. What are you, really?"
"204987124-0-12495";"How can I stop her?"
"204987124-0-12497";"This is for you."
"204987124-0-12500";"Think a moment. Does your wife remember your time together before she died?"
"204987124-0-12505";"She only awoke here? May I meet her?"
"204987124-0-12509";"I found her journal, as well. Her last thoughts were about you."
"204987124-0-12513";"What does this have to do with the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-12514";"Can you get the map translated?"
"204987124-0-12518";"Then let's get started."
"204987124-0-12519";"Why would this keep the guard from doing their jobs?"
"204987124-0-12521";"Who are the Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-12522";"Do you know who would want to harm Arilen?"
"204987124-0-12526";"Who are the vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-12527";"What can you tell me about Stormhold?"
"204987124-0-12528";"Where did you go to?"
"204987124-0-12529";"What kind of experiments are you conducting?"
"204987124-0-12530";"How did you get the shards?"
"204987124-0-12531";"Which Daedric Lord was this?"
"204987124-0-12532";"What sort of ceremony?"
"204987124-0-12533";"What kind of symbols?"
"204987124-0-12536";"What happened to your people?"
"204987124-0-12537";"What kind of power?"
"204987124-0-12538";"How did you get the shards?"
"204987124-0-12539";"How did it end up in the hands of the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-12540";"What kind of symbols?"
"204987124-0-12541";"Why did they break the crystal into shards?"
"204987124-0-12542";"What sort of ceremony?"
"204987124-0-12543";"What are the Supernal Dreamers up to?"
"204987124-0-12544";"What does the Crystal of Power do?"
"204987124-0-12545";"Who do you think took it?"
"204987124-0-12546";"How did you lose the crystal?"
"204987124-0-12548";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-12549";"What was the destiny he claimed you had?"
"204987124-0-12550";"Which of the Daedric Lords was this?"
"204987124-0-12551";"How did you lose your crystal?"
"204987124-0-12554";"You need to give me something to go on."
"204987124-0-12558";"What does the curse do?"
"204987124-0-12559";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-12560";"This isn't a military outpost?"
"204987124-0-12561";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-12562";"While I'm like this, am I invincible?"
"204987124-0-12563";"I'll bring her the <<z:1>> when I recover it."
"204987124-0-12566";"Just crab meat and ashreeds."
"204987124-0-12568";"Tell me more about the Dark Elf you caught."
"204987124-0-12569";"Let's go to the tree now."
"204987124-0-12572";"That's all of them, I hope?"
"204987124-0-12575";"You can trust me. I have no reason to lie."
"204987124-0-12577";"You must believe me. If you don't, more people will die."
"204987124-0-12586";"Pash-Riha told me. Where are they?"
"204987124-0-12588";"Tell me what you need."
"204987124-0-12589";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-12590";"Why are the Telvanni here?"
"204987124-0-12591";"What is this totem for?"
"204987124-0-12593";"Why are your field assistants still here?"
"204987124-0-12594";"Why didn't you use the totem before I arrived?"
"204987124-0-12595";"Can you tell me more about the curse?"
"204987124-0-12596";"Tell me about the reliquary."
"204987124-0-12597";"I'll kill him for you."
"204987124-0-12599";"What is this curse?"
"204987124-0-12600";"Very well. Get out of here."
"204987124-0-12601";"Go on."
"204987124-0-12603";"That couldn't be good."
"204987124-0-12604";"What can we do to save her?"
"204987124-0-12606";"I'll summon, defeat, and bind the mages."
"204987124-0-12607";"So, because I'm unknown in your hierarchy, I'll be able to get to the truth?"
"204987124-0-12608";"I'll find out what happened."
"204987124-0-12609";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-12620";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-12621";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-12624";"I'll spread the news."
"204987124-0-12630";"Who's Gharzu?"
"204987124-0-12641";"Where's it all going?"
"204987124-0-12644";"Armies?"

"204987124-0-12652";"Sir Edgard sent me after you and the other Lion Guards. He wants you back safe."
"204987124-0-12656";"Is this what the noble Lion Guard have come to? Leave at once! This is disgraceful."
"204987124-0-12659";"Sir Edgard sent me to handle the situation."
"204987124-0-12660";"You need to come with me."
"204987124-0-12664";"Gharzu had a pack of thugs with him. What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-12670";"So you're a deserter?"
"204987124-0-12672";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-12676";"Do I need to kill one of their leaders?"
"204987124-0-12679";"Where do you think the fumes came from?"
"204987124-0-12684";"Why did Boril go back?"
"204987124-0-12685";"I'll drink it and then find your husband."
"204987124-0-12687";"Why have you returned to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-12689";"But you destroyed her, right?"
"204987124-0-12695";"It's not for me. It's for a friend."
"204987124-0-12697";"Go on. I'll just take notes."
"204987124-0-12698";"I'll just write this down."
"204987124-0-12699";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-12700";"I'll look for her."
"204987124-0-12701";"Who are the Kothringi?"
"204987124-0-12702";"What's a keystone?"
"204987124-0-12705";"Where is the keystone?"
"204987124-0-12707";"Only if your crown leads to the keystone."
"204987124-0-12708";"I'll set their souls free."
"204987124-0-12709";"The invaders disturbed the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-12711";"How did a Nord come to have a hold in Stonefalls?"
"204987124-0-12720";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-12728";"If the Ashlanders attack, everyone here may die."
"204987124-0-12730";"I was asked to look into Navisdyn's murder."
"204987124-0-12731";"Are you sure the fumes haven't affected you?"
"204987124-0-12732";"What should I do after scattering their ashes?"
"204987124-0-12733";"Is there nothing I can do?"
"204987124-0-12734";"Why do I have to fight them to get their help?"
"204987124-0-12735";"Anything else I should look out for in the mines?"
"204987124-0-12737";"After you, Lady Volek. <Go along with the ambush.>"
"204987124-0-12741";"A pair of Argonians. They'll strike as soon as you step inside."
"204987124-0-12742";"You won't face them alone."
"204987124-0-12743";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-12751";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-12758";"How did you come to be the last of the Voleks?"
"204987124-0-12759";"Why have you returned to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-12761";"Let me accompany you to your family home. <Don't tell Betina about the ambush.>"
"204987124-0-12765";"And you want me to stop him?"
"204987124-0-12767";"Why did the Ashlanders attack?"
"204987124-0-12768";"Will there be any adverse affects?"
"204987124-0-12771";"<Examine the significant wound.>"
"204987124-0-12773";"I should talk to someone in the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-12774";"I'll take a look."
"204987124-0-12775";"The ghost said you were the last of the Kothringi."
"204987124-0-12779";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-12781";"I'm not sure what that has to do with these statues."
"204987124-0-12783";"You said you were Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-12785";"Yes."
"204987124-0-12786";"<<1>> said to meet at the rendezvous."
"204987124-0-12787";"<<1>> said to meet at the rendezvous."
"204987124-0-12792";"Bothisii suggested I talk to you and tell you about the tunic I found."
"204987124-0-12793";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-12794";"Why didn't you use the artifact sooner?"
"204987124-0-12795";"Why didn't you use the device sooner?"
"204987124-0-12796";"He betrayed your people. Why do you care?"
"204987124-0-12797";"It's better to know the truth."
"204987124-0-12798";"Where did Hedranna get this device?"
"204987124-0-12799";"Where did Hedranna get this device?"
"204987124-0-12800";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-12801";"What tools should I use?"
"204987124-0-12802";"So you want me to take out the supports while I'm in the tunnel?"
"204987124-0-12803";"And what will happen when I hit the last one?"
"204987124-0-12806";"Then what are we waiting for?"
"204987124-0-12807";"The alchemist's lab is inside the ruins. All his notes on the plague are there."
"204987124-0-12808";"What about the clouds of plague?"
"204987124-0-12810";"That didn't happen."
"204987124-0-12821";"Weapon crates? Where are they?"
"204987124-0-12822";"The Steel Mask?"
"204987124-0-12823";"And you took it."
"204987124-0-12825";"I need to find this Steel Mask."
"204987124-0-12826";"Thank you, Balreth."
"204987124-0-12827";"The spirits mentioned the Chimer. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-12828";"I can place the potions."
"204987124-0-12829";"What do I need to do to gain access to this weaponsmith?"
"204987124-0-12830";"Who are the Nedes?"
"204987124-0-12831";"Who are the Chimer?"
"204987124-0-12832";"Who are the Nedes?"
"204987124-0-12834";"I need to find the Steel Mask before his latest work gets him into trouble."
"204987124-0-12835";"Do you have a plan?"
"204987124-0-12843";"Are you saying that you did this?"
"204987124-0-12844";"Calm down. You're not going to get eaten."
"204987124-0-12852";"I will."
"204987124-0-12854";"So can you perform your ritual?"
"204987124-0-12855";"How can I help you?"
"204987124-0-12857";"I'll find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-12859";"What are plague husks?"
"204987124-0-12860";"All right."
"204987124-0-12861";"What do we have to do?"
"204987124-0-12868";"I'm ready. Let's begin."
"204987124-0-12870";"I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-12872";"Do you know anything about Zuuk's keystone?"
"204987124-0-12873";"I have the amulet you gave Renvis."
"204987124-0-12876";"To shut the mine down so she could spend time with you."
"204987124-0-12877";"I'm sorry this happened."
"204987124-0-12887";"Certainly. Your blade will feast today."
"204987124-0-12891";"Here."
"204987124-0-12892";"There's been a murder and evidence points to House Dres."
"204987124-0-12896";"What's it about?"
"204987124-0-12898";"Only those involved will be punished."
"204987124-0-12902";"So who was Fjokki?"
"204987124-0-12903";"What's the book about?"
"204987124-0-12908";"I was hoping to trade it for a book on Dunmer culture and etiquette."
"204987124-0-12913";"What do you mean by ""sacrifice""?"
"204987124-0-12915";"So you want me to take out the supports while I'm in the tunnel?"
"204987124-0-12923";"Why would the pirates work for the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-12924";"Why are you in the stocks?"
"204987124-0-12927";"Maybe I could speak to the leader on your behalf."
"204987124-0-12929";"What's the Dominion doing in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-12933";"I won't be responsible for your death. We must make do without the keystone."
"204987124-0-12934";"I need to reconsider this."
"204987124-0-12935";"I need to reconsider this."
"204987124-0-12936";"I won't be responsible for your death. We must make do without the keystone."
"204987124-0-12937";"Why must the last Volek die?"
"204987124-0-12939";"Where should I take these clothes?"
"204987124-0-12940";"I prefer someone who can handle a blade."
"204987124-0-12943";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-12944";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-12958";"What is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-12960";"I see."
"204987124-0-12961";"I see."
"204987124-0-12962";"I see."
"204987124-0-12963";"I'll return shortly."
"204987124-0-12964";"What is your riddle?"
"204987124-0-12965";"A lamp."
"204987124-0-12967";"A boat."
"204987124-0-12968";"A boat."
"204987124-0-12970";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-12971";"I have these clothes from a group of Nords. They want to trade them for Dark Elf finery."
"204987124-0-12975";"The Nords will be most appreciative. Thank you."
"204987124-0-12976";"Well, I have this relic …."
"204987124-0-12978";"That's the idea, yes."
"204987124-0-12979";"Why was he so angry?"
"204987124-0-12980";"And the Ashkhan was fed up with that."
"204987124-0-12981";"I don't understand. What are the House Dunmer doing?"
"204987124-0-12983";"What's your stake in this?"
"204987124-0-12991";"Thank you, spirit."
"204987124-0-13005";"Why are you here again?"
"204987124-0-13006";"What's a lamia?"
"204987124-0-13007";"Why are you here again?"
"204987124-0-13012";"Are you ready for this?"
"204987124-0-13014";"This place looks lived in. Why?"
"204987124-0-13015";"What can you tell me about Ssethreka?"
"204987124-0-13016";"This place looks lived in. Why?"
"204987124-0-13017";"Can you move?"
"204987124-0-13024";"Come on."
"204987124-0-13025";"Is there trouble at Zehtswater Cave?"
"204987124-0-13027";"What does all this have to do with you?"
"204987124-0-13028";"Where are your friends?"
"204987124-0-13029";"I'm not here to escape. I need to stop the Dominion."
"204987124-0-13031";"The Dremora said she'd tell me the Dominion's plans if I free her."
"204987124-0-13033";"The Dremora said she'd tell me the Dominion's plans if I free her."
"204987124-0-13034";"I'm honored, Sacred Lady."
"204987124-0-13035";"I know how to lower the wards, Walks-in-Ash."
"204987124-0-13036";"Where are the rest of the wards?"
"204987124-0-13038";"I'll get it done."
"204987124-0-13039";"You can't unleash Sadal on Stonefalls. It's madness."
"204987124-0-13040";"How do we get to Sadal?"
"204987124-0-13042";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-13043";"You mean she'll escape again?"
"204987124-0-13045";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-13048";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-13050";"I'll get your bloodsacs and venom."
"204987124-0-13054";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-13055";"You honor me, Sacred Lady."
"204987124-0-13056";"Why do you care about appearances?"
"204987124-0-13058";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13059";"Why are assassins fighting Dominion soldiers?"
"204987124-0-13060";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13061";"How do I get in?"
"204987124-0-13063";"Can't I get in the same way Magistrix Vox did?"
"204987124-0-13064";"Tell me what I must do."
"204987124-0-13067";"I'd never help anyone who murders the innocent."
"204987124-0-13072";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-13073";"And the Coiled Path?"
"204987124-0-13075";"Tell me about the Mabrigash and the Vale of the Ghost Snake."
"204987124-0-13077";"Why me?"
"204987124-0-13078";"Yes, start the ritual."
"204987124-0-13080";"We must rebind the Brother. That's all that matters."
"204987124-0-13082";"What must I do to prove myself?"
"204987124-0-13083";"How?"
"204987124-0-13085";"Send me up."
"204987124-0-13086";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-13088";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-13090";"What do I do this time?"
"204987124-0-13092";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-13094";"I'm ready, Mavos. Let's go."
"204987124-0-13095";"To set you free."
"204987124-0-13105";"Why is this one called the Relleis Lor keystone?"
"204987124-0-13109";"How did the corruption start?"
"204987124-0-13114";"What does the relic do?"
"204987124-0-13115";"You were a fanatic devoted to Daedric Princes. You cursed the Tribunal."
"204987124-0-13116";"You slaughtered innocents while trying to destroy the Tribunal."
"204987124-0-13117";"It's best to forget what happened. It wasn't your fault."
"204987124-0-13122";"<Take the journal.>"
"204987124-0-13132";"I'll do as you say, Sorcerer."
"204987124-0-13133";"Who cursed you?"
"204987124-0-13134";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13135";"Very well. What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13136";"What's the Chamber of the Tree?"
"204987124-0-13137";"Maybe it can quench the flames?"
"204987124-0-13143";"Does your leader rush into danger very often?"
"204987124-0-13145";"But we need to talk."
"204987124-0-13147";"What was that strange glow around some of the prisoners?"
"204987124-0-13149";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-13155";"What does Vox want?"
"204987124-0-13156";"How did she acquire such a powerful artifact?"
"204987124-0-13157";"What's she up to?"
"204987124-0-13166";"I'm here to help. Everything stays between you and me. I promise."
"204987124-0-13168";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-13169";"If that's the only way to end this, so be it."
"204987124-0-13184";"How can the portals be closed?"
"204987124-0-13190";"Why didn't you just leave?"
"204987124-0-13194";"What's in these orders?"
"204987124-0-13195";"Who do you want me to kill?"
"204987124-0-13197";"I'll take care of the Imperials. Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-13204";"If I can. Do you know where it is?"
"204987124-0-13207";"What's a lamia?"
"204987124-0-13209";"No. You must be stopped."
"204987124-0-13210";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-13212";"The Keeper?"
"204987124-0-13218";"I'm sorry, spirit."
"204987124-0-13219";"How?"
"204987124-0-13220";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-13221";"What powers does Veloth's Judgment possess?"
"204987124-0-13223";"How?"
"204987124-0-13225";"I'll do my best to defeat Vox."
"204987124-0-13226";"Would defeating the Keeper set you free?"
"204987124-0-13228";"Any advice on how to fight it?"
"204987124-0-13229";"What puzzle?"
"204987124-0-13231";"And you can't do that?"
"204987124-0-13232";"Almalexia executed you for murder. Your mother placed you here."
"204987124-0-13234";"The Tribunal punished you. Vox placed you here."
"204987124-0-13236";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13238";"Isn't Veloth one of the heroes of Dunmer civilization?"
"204987124-0-13239";"<Destroy the keystone.>"
"204987124-0-13244";"Are the priests of the shrine all right?"
"204987124-0-13245";"Isn't Veloth one of the heroes of Dunmer civilization?"
"204987124-0-13246";"<Examine the arbiter.>"
"204987124-0-13248";"Why are my companions spirits again? I restored them."
"204987124-0-13249";"I have to fix something, just so I can destroy it?"
"204987124-0-13253";"Is that it? Is it over?"
"204987124-0-13256";"Acolyte Eldri said you needed these Dremora hearts."
"204987124-0-13266";"How does that help?"
"204987124-0-13267";"How will that help me save Selfora?"
"204987124-0-13268";"Why would they do that?"
"204987124-0-13269";"You said Argonian ghosts are unnatural?"
"204987124-0-13270";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-13272";"Why are the Daedra here?"
"204987124-0-13273";"And then?"
"204987124-0-13274";"What was she looking for?"
"204987124-0-13276";"Let's do it."
"204987124-0-13278";"Where are you going, Guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-13282";"See you soon, then."
"204987124-0-13284";"The portal is open. Do you have any other advice?"
"204987124-0-13285";"So we need to keep Balreth away from the lava."
"204987124-0-13286";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-13288";"Thank you, Mavos."
"204987124-0-13289";"Here you are."
"204987124-0-13291";"Screaming?"
"204987124-0-13292";"The spirits are what, exactly?"
"204987124-0-13293";"I understand."
"204987124-0-13294";"Why is the sap so important?"
"204987124-0-13295";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-13297";"Great! Here you go."
"204987124-0-13299";"How do I take the wine, then?"
"204987124-0-13305";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13306";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-13307";"I'm ready to protect you. Start the ritual."
"204987124-0-13309";"What can the Dominion do?"
"204987124-0-13311";"I'm ready. Begin the ritual."
"204987124-0-13313";"How can the staff restore the spirits?"
"204987124-0-13317";"May you find peace, Tidyn Arthalen."
"204987124-0-13320";"Can we undo this?"
"204987124-0-13321";"Let's do it."
"204987124-0-13330";"You're not worth the effort. Get out of here. <Let the retainer live.>"
"204987124-0-13331";"That's not right. Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-13333";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-13335";"That's it?"
"204987124-0-13340";"Why did Edrasa do this?"
"204987124-0-13341";"Get moving."
"204987124-0-13342";"All this for a weekend in the city?"
"204987124-0-13344";"Thanks, Mavos."
"204987124-0-13345";"Take care, Mavos."
"204987124-0-13346";"Any advice on where I should start?"
"204987124-0-13348";"Makes sense."
"204987124-0-13349";"Why don't you care for her?"
"204987124-0-13350";"What do you mean by jumpy?"
"204987124-0-13352";"Very well. Take this and go."
"204987124-0-13359";"Something like that."
"204987124-0-13361";"The cuttle doesn't actually belong to you."
"204987124-0-13363";"That makes a certain amount of sense."
"204987124-0-13368";"What are you going to do with it?"
"204987124-0-13370";"That's not exactly how he put it, but yes."
"204987124-0-13381";"How can I safely recover the <<z:1>>?"
"204987124-0-13382";"There's an urgent matter we must discuss."
"204987124-0-13384";"Thank you, Grandmaster."
"204987124-0-13385";"What's the control rod do?"
"204987124-0-13395";"What's the control rod do?"
"204987124-0-13398";"This sounds pretty reckless."
"204987124-0-13408";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-13412";"Why not live in town, then?"
"204987124-0-13413";"Why won't they let you inside?"
"204987124-0-13414";"That's quite an accusation. Tell me more."
"204987124-0-13415";"And the … housemen, you called them?"
"204987124-0-13416";"What can you tell me about their camp?"
"204987124-0-13417";"Tell me about the creatures I'm hunting."
"204987124-0-13418";"Thank you, Kaasha."
"204987124-0-13419";"That's right."
"204987124-0-13421";"Where can I find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13422";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-13423";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-13426";"The killer won't trouble you anymore."
"204987124-0-13433";"How does the grandmaster control access to the peak?"
"204987124-0-13434";"How did you die?"
"204987124-0-13436";"Do you know where your children could be?"
"204987124-0-13437";"Is there anything I should know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13438";"What can you tell me about the prison?"
"204987124-0-13444";"But you know where it is?"
"204987124-0-13446";"Is there anything I should know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13449";"Why is the Vanguard here?"
"204987124-0-13450";"Why did some of the prisoners go feral?"
"204987124-0-13451";"How did you come to be imprisoned here?"
"204987124-0-13454";"Why is the Vanguard here?"
"204987124-0-13455";"Why is Tormented Spire important again?"
"204987124-0-13456";"How can you stomach still owning slaves?"
"204987124-0-13457";"That won't be a problem."
"204987124-0-13458";"Is this sort of thing normal in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13459";"I'm interested. Tell me about all the creatures your tribe has faced."
"204987124-0-13460";"Is this sort of thing normal in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13461";"I'm interested. Tell me about all the creatures your tribe has faced."
"204987124-0-13462";"Is this sort of thing normal in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-13463";"I'm interested. Tell me about all the creatures your tribe has faced."
"204987124-0-13471";"What did you find?"
"204987124-0-13472";"Maybe I can seal the rest of the vials."
"204987124-0-13473";"I'm sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-13477";"Yes"
"204987124-0-13479";"Cool!"
"204987124-0-13480";"Well, um, err"
"204987124-0-13482";"But"
"204987124-0-13483";"Hey, you can talk."
"204987124-0-13486";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-13488";"Wow.  Just, wow."
"204987124-0-13490";"What was she yelling about wanting your soul?"
"204987124-0-13491";"Really?"
"204987124-0-13493";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-13498";"Show me."
"204987124-0-13499";"I don't believe it."
"204987124-0-13505";"How did you know?"
"204987124-0-13507";"For real?"
"204987124-0-13508";"It would seem so."
"204987124-0-13509";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-13510";"What can the spider do?"
"204987124-0-13511";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-13512";"What makes you so sure?"
"204987124-0-13513";"What can the spider do?"
"204987124-0-13515";"So you want me to go collect spider parts?"
"204987124-0-13531";"Who are you and why are you here?"
"204987124-0-13532";"What now?"
"204987124-0-13535";"She wanted him for something called the Mortuum Vivicus? We found this journal and some notes."
"204987124-0-13537";"Is there anything else I can do?"
"204987124-0-13538";"And what if it isn't?"
"204987124-0-13539";"Tanval told me he planned to resign his position."
"204987124-0-13542";"And you. Farewell."
"204987124-0-13545";"You know more than you're telling me."
"204987124-0-13547";"You know a lot about the target. Any hints for an up-and coming ""shanker?"""
"204987124-0-13549";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13551";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-13553";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-13555";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13557";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-13559";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-13561";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13563";"I do have wine. Here."
"204987124-0-13566";"Which subjects?"
"204987124-0-13568";"What's a keystone?"
"204987124-0-13607";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-13610";"Do you know anything about this place?"
"204987124-0-13613";"I will."
"204987124-0-13614";"I'll work something out."
"204987124-0-13617";"You seem a bit young for this line of work."
"204987124-0-13619";"What Academy?"
"204987124-0-13620";"What are you hoping to find?"
"204987124-0-13621";"What Academy?"
"204987124-0-13624";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-13625";"How can the staff restore the spirits?"
"204987124-0-13626";"How do you know the skin-stealers are here?"
"204987124-0-13627";"How do you know the skin-stealers are here?"
"204987124-0-13628";"What's a skin-stealer?"
"204987124-0-13629";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-13630";"Who is Sadal?"
"204987124-0-13631";"What is the Tormented Spire?"
"204987124-0-13632";"What is the Tormented Spire?"
"204987124-0-13633";"Is something wrong with Kragenmoor?"
"204987124-0-13634";"Glad I could help."
"204987124-0-13638";"Why do you think Tanval did this?"
"204987124-0-13639";"Now what should we do?"
"204987124-0-13642";"What sort of artifacts?"
"204987124-0-13643";"Something like this statue?"
"204987124-0-13644";"Can I help you search?"
"204987124-0-13645";"Have you ever seen anything like it before?"
"204987124-0-13647";"Who could identify this?"
"204987124-0-13648";"I'll find Saint Veloth's skull."
"204987124-0-13650";"You should have told me the truth from the beginning."
"204987124-0-13651";"Fine, take the trinkets. Just make sure it goes to feed your family."
"204987124-0-13655";"Return the goods, or I make sure the guards hear of this."
"204987124-0-13667";"I met a group of Nords in Mournhold. They want to exchange religious relics. They gave me this."
"204987124-0-13668";"I'm sure the Nords will understand."
"204987124-0-13669";"Do you have something I could bring back to the Nords?"
"204987124-0-13675";"If they have a map, they'll find the treasure."
"204987124-0-13679";"If they have the stones, they'll find the treasure."
"204987124-0-13683";"I bought it from an Ashlander merchant. He found it in the wastes."
"204987124-0-13684";"Someone was looking for this?"
"204987124-0-13686";"Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-13687";"Found one … what?"
"204987124-0-13689";"That's nice. But what is this?"
"204987124-0-13691";"Your son said finding your remains could help you."
"204987124-0-13693";"Where's Eidolon's Hollow?"
"204987124-0-13697";"Tell me more about these relics."
"204987124-0-13698";"Tell me more about these relics."
"204987124-0-13700";"Yes. You thought a Daedric Anchor might drop here."
"204987124-0-13701";"Where do you want me?"
"204987124-0-13705";"Here you are."
"204987124-0-13706";"You must believe me. If you don't, more people will die."
"204987124-0-13708";"What's worse than that?"
"204987124-0-13711";"What will we find?"
"204987124-0-13717";"No one's gone to find out?"
"204987124-0-13718";"How do I get to the temple?"
"204987124-0-13719";"You want me to go up there?"
"204987124-0-13721";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-13722";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-13723";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13729";"I'll get what you need."
"204987124-0-13730";"Get moving."
"204987124-0-13732";"Is there anyone else missing?"
"204987124-0-13733";"I'll go and see if he's there."
"204987124-0-13734";"I didn't see him."
"204987124-0-13736";"Enough of that. Get going."
"204987124-0-13738";"Someone I'm challenging to a fight. Winner gets to keep your invitation."
"204987124-0-13741";"Think so? Give me your invitation or you'll find out."
"204987124-0-13743";"A fight? Sounds fun. Winner gets your invitation."
"204987124-0-13747";"I only want your invitation. Your death would be an accident."
"204987124-0-13748";"Then why are you here?"
"204987124-0-13750";"I could take that invitation off your hands."
"204987124-0-13753";"I thought you understood after what happened with Balreth."
"204987124-0-13755";"Is there any way you can help?"
"204987124-0-13756";"<<1>> gave me this."
"204987124-0-13758";"Why do you call me blind?"
"204987124-0-13767";"There was a soul gem, and gem fragments, in his quarters."
"204987124-0-13770";"What was that about the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-13771";"Some kind of what?"
"204987124-0-13772";"Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-13777";"<Take the insignia.>"
"204987124-0-13780";"You can do that?"
"204987124-0-13781";"Go ahead."
"204987124-0-13784";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-13785";"I'll return with the stone."
"204987124-0-13788";"Know anyone who might be willing to give up an invitation?"
"204987124-0-13790";"I'll find the decanter."
"204987124-0-13799";"I'm just as good as anyone on this dock."
"204987124-0-13809";"You mean your Goblin problem?"
"204987124-0-13812";"Follow me!"
"204987124-0-13819";"Good boy!"
"204987124-0-13820";"Follow me!"
"204987124-0-13826";"Tell me about Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-13828";"Is he dangerous?"
"204987124-0-13829";"Can you delay the hatching until it's safe?"
"204987124-0-13831";"You don't want the relics?"
"204987124-0-13833";"What are the Fangs of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-13834";"Really?"
"204987124-0-13835";"Can you tell me more about the Academy?"
"204987124-0-13836";"Is it part of the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-13838";"Sounds like you've had it rough."
"204987124-0-13839";"Ouch."
"204987124-0-13840";"Uh …."
"204987124-0-13842";"I'm going to go now."
"204987124-0-13843";"Protect the Academy? From what?"
"204987124-0-13845";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-13848";"This has happened before?"
"204987124-0-13851";"Are there Daedric ruins nearby?"
"204987124-0-13853";"Orana wants that amulet back."
"204987124-0-13854";"What can you tell me about Tanval Indoril?"
"204987124-0-13855";"Do you think this place really exists?"
"204987124-0-13857";"What do you want with the girl?"
"204987124-0-13860";"What's a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-13861";"Did he say why I must use the altar?"
"204987124-0-13862";"Where is Ra-shadda now?"
"204987124-0-13863";"Did he say why I must use the altar?"
"204987124-0-13864";"Where is Ra-shadda now?"
"204987124-0-13868";"I don't understand. How did she get her way?"
"204987124-0-13869";"And how am I going to do that?"
"204987124-0-13871";"And now he's back here?"
"204987124-0-13873";"I'll find the key. Thank you, Magister."
"204987124-0-13875";"Let me help. What do you need to do?"
"204987124-0-13876";"What does the wand do?"
"204987124-0-13878";"What do you mean? He's outside right now."
"204987124-0-13880";"More than that. I can see the nightmares."
"204987124-0-13882";"No. Your hands are stained with blood."
"204987124-0-13884";"You've killed willingly, whatever your intentions. I can't let you stay here."
"204987124-0-13885";"The hatchlings need you now more than ever. I will leave you in peace."
"204987124-0-13886";"How long until the hatchlings are out?"
"204987124-0-13887";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-13893";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-13895";"You can't pick on people. Leave!"
"204987124-0-13901";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-13902";"You didn't try to figure out the riddle?"
"204987124-0-13904";"Ashamed of what?"
"204987124-0-13905";"I'll help you. How does the totem work?"
"204987124-0-13908";"Does he have a problem with the drink?"
"204987124-0-13914";"So  <<1>>'s selling poison to the Blacksails?"
"204987124-0-13915";"Flash Powder?"
"204987124-0-13916";"When will the hatching be complete?"
"204987124-0-13919";"<Place the <<1>> in the chest.>"
"204987124-0-13923";"Colors and I saw into the past. We saw one of the Ayleids try to destroy the Mortuum Vivicus."
"204987124-0-13924";"<Place the <<1>> in the chest.>"
"204987124-0-13925";"<Place the <<1>> in the chest.>"
"204987124-0-13932";"How do I maintain the fire?"
"204987124-0-13934";"I understand."
"204987124-0-13935";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13937";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13938";"They're forcing the students to fight for them?"
"204987124-0-13940";"What did the Arch-Mage order you to do?"
"204987124-0-13941";"He wants to sever the link between Hist and Argonians."
"204987124-0-13943";"I can try."
"204987124-0-13944";"Where did Arch-Mage Valeyn go?"
"204987124-0-13945";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13946";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13949";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13950";"<Take the <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-13958";"What about Lena and Tedras?"
"204987124-0-13959";"Did the Arch-Mage say anything else?"
"204987124-0-13960";"Where is it?"
"204987124-0-13962";"It sounds like the Arch-Mage has a plan."
"204987124-0-13964";"Where can I get those ingredients?"
"204987124-0-13965";"Way ahead of you. Here you go."
"204987124-0-13967";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-13968";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-13969";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-13975";"How are you going to do that?"
"204987124-0-13977";"<<1>> is rallying soldiers to assault the ruins."
"204987124-0-13978";"I'll enter the ruins and search for <<1>>."
"204987124-0-13983";"[Travel] I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-13986";"Molag Bal withdrew the Vivicus to Coldharbour before it could be destroyed."
"204987124-0-13988";"What if I get the fire too hot?"
"204987124-0-13989";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-13992";"So Shad Astula is safe again?"
"204987124-0-13993";"You watched over me the entire time?"
"204987124-0-13995";"So that's why the Maulborn attacked Shad Astula?"
"204987124-0-13996";"Is that it, then?"
"204987124-0-13997";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-13999";"Not you?"
"204987124-0-14000";"<<1>> is a spider?"
"204987124-0-14001";"How did Jofnir die?"
"204987124-0-14004";"I'll do better."
"204987124-0-14007";"I'll do better."
"204987124-0-14009";"There are bigger ones?"
"204987124-0-14010";"What does it do?"
"204987124-0-14011";"I can get some. Do we need anything else?"
"204987124-0-14012";"They will fall before me."
"204987124-0-14014";"Merric, how do you think they found us?"
"204987124-0-14015";"You sold an experimental device to House Dres?"
"204987124-0-14018";"Lead on, my friend."
"204987124-0-14020";"Why did the tree-minder do that?"
"204987124-0-14021";"Why did the tree-minder lure your husband here?"
"204987124-0-14022";"You said the invaders mentioned crystals."
"204987124-0-14024";"The Earth Forge was attacked by the dead of Abagarlas. Molag Bal taunted us during the assault."
"204987124-0-14026";"There's more. After the attack Jofnir appeared to us and told us he'd been murdered."
"204987124-0-14032";"Right. Thanks."
"204987124-0-14033";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-14034";"Thanks, Riud."
"204987124-0-14036";"After you, then."
"204987124-0-14038";"Is Rulantaril here? His son, Telbaril, is trying to find him."
"204987124-0-14039";"I'll try not to hurt him."
"204987124-0-14040";"You won't escape."
"204987124-0-14041";"Time to end this."
"204987124-0-14042";"You shouldn't be alone. I'll make Rulantaril honor his agreement."
"204987124-0-14049";"Perhaps we wait for Sees-All-Colors? She said she'd rally the Guild."
"204987124-0-14050";"Who was that woman? Who kidnapped Merric?"
"204987124-0-14051";"I'll find him."
"204987124-0-14052";"Dourstone?"
"204987124-0-14053";"How are you dealing with your new position?"
"204987124-0-14055";"Do you know how the recovery effort is going?"
"204987124-0-14057";"You regret summoning Balreth?"
"204987124-0-14059";"Rumors?"
"204987124-0-14061";"Where's the daedroth now?"
"204987124-0-14070";"I need more food scraps."
"204987124-0-14072";"I only wanted to help."
"204987124-0-14080";"How do I avoid killing Goblins?"
"204987124-0-14082";"Can I get more food scraps?"
"204987124-0-14083";"Where did the Goblins come from? Why did they attack?"
"204987124-0-14084";"Where did the Goblins come from? Why'd they attack?"
"204987124-0-14091";"Keep going. I'm just going to write this down."
"204987124-0-14094";"I can barely understand what you're saying."
"204987124-0-14103";"You seem tense."
"204987124-0-14104";"What's in the bag?"
"204987124-0-14105";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-14107";"I'll recover the pieces of your reliquary."
"204987124-0-14108";"Tell me what you want to do now."
"204987124-0-14110";"I'll find the Blackfeather Court."
"204987124-0-14111";"Tell me about the toll of flesh."
"204987124-0-14112";"Tell me about the toll of silver."
"204987124-0-14113";"Tell me about the toll of flesh."
"204987124-0-14114";"I choose the toll of flesh."
"204987124-0-14116";"Eight bats? I can do that."
"204987124-0-14118";"I'll get the silver."
"204987124-0-14120";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-14121";"Actually, I didn't find anything in there. [Laughs-at-All lives]"
"204987124-0-14126";"Well, good."
"204987124-0-14128";"Very well."
"204987124-0-14132";"What are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-14133";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-14134";"Where did you come from?"
"204987124-0-14136";"Do you miss your mother?"
"204987124-0-14140";"All right. I hope I remain immune to them."
"204987124-0-14144";"What is this task?"
"204987124-0-14145";"How do we create this sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-14147";"Where are these tomes?"
"204987124-0-14148";"Give me the Fangs, and I'll let you live."
"204987124-0-14149";"After what?"
"204987124-0-14152";"I'll take this to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-14154";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-14155";"Right. I'll just take them with me, then."
"204987124-0-14156";"What kind of contest?"
"204987124-0-14157";"I'm not sure that's how it works."
"204987124-0-14158";"I suppose … it's a deal."
"204987124-0-14160";"Right now, shouldn't you work together? Senie is burning."
"204987124-0-14167";"Your assistant isn't here?"
"204987124-0-14171";"All right. I will."
"204987124-0-14172";"We'll see …."
"204987124-0-14175";"If you insist."
"204987124-0-14179";"How do we disrupt the shield?"
"204987124-0-14181";"And then?"
"204987124-0-14183";"A pocket of Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-14184";"I'm not your Mistress."
"204987124-0-14185";"Of course … soldier. Report in. What can you tell me about the ""Song of Sinmur""?"
"204987124-0-14186";"Don't worry. Here, practice on me. Sing me a line."
"204987124-0-14187";"All right … daughter. Sing something from the ""Song of Sinmur."""
"204987124-0-14188";"Why was the portal that brought me here inside a chest?"
"204987124-0-14189";"You seem to know a lot about Oblivion."
"204987124-0-14192";"Eaten?"
"204987124-0-14193";"We need to wake up the other skalds. Odana says we need to perform the Song of Sinmur."
"204987124-0-14194";"Ah. I see. Can we go to the school now?"
"204987124-0-14196";"Why do you want Rulantaril to stay here?"
"204987124-0-14198";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-14200";"How did you come to be imprisoned here?"
"204987124-0-14201";"What? Why?"
"204987124-0-14206";"You're free. Go!"
"204987124-0-14208";"You're free, go!"
"204987124-0-14210";"Go, find him!"
"204987124-0-14212";"Get going."
"204987124-0-14214";"An idiot?"
"204987124-0-14215";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-14217";"I might be a Supernal Dreamer myself, you know."
"204987124-0-14218";"You're a knight, eh?"
"204987124-0-14219";"What can you tell me about the duke?"
"204987124-0-14221";"Can you tell me about this quest?"
"204987124-0-14223";"Here's that grub grass you wanted."
"204987124-0-14224";"There are fish in the lake?"
"204987124-0-14226";"Nothing here is real?"
"204987124-0-14227";"Where are these crystals?"
"204987124-0-14229";"Why do they want it?"
"204987124-0-14230";"Speaking of magic, what's with your hobo-shack?"
"204987124-0-14231";"It means supernatural or mystical."
"204987124-0-14232";"Who has the crystals?"
"204987124-0-14233";"So tell me why you had a Crystal of Power?"
"204987124-0-14234";"What's up?"
"204987124-0-14235";"Why do they want to do that?"
"204987124-0-14236";"Fine, don't believe me."
"204987124-0-14238";"Man?"
"204987124-0-14239";"I told you."
"204987124-0-14240";"Oh, stop whining. How'd you lose your bongos?"
"204987124-0-14241";"Who are Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-14244";"And who are the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-14245";"Uh, right. So, why do you like these crystals?"
"204987124-0-14246";"Who are these guys?"
"204987124-0-14247";"Can you tell me about the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-14249";"Right, don't believe me."
"204987124-0-14250";"What's the rod do?"
"204987124-0-14252";"Good."
"204987124-0-14253";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-14254";"Who has the crystals?"
"204987124-0-14256";"Wow, why are you so lame?"
"204987124-0-14257";"I might be a Supernal Dreamer, you know."
"204987124-0-14258";"What's a ""power crystal""?"
"204987124-0-14259";"So tell me why you had a Crystal of Power?"
"204987124-0-14262";"A Dark Elf keeps a portal open. That's a way out."
"204987124-0-14264";"Can I do nothing to help you?"
"204987124-0-14265";"I'm considering leniency."
"204987124-0-14267";"She's earned time in a cell until the conflict ends."
"204987124-0-14268";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-14274";"Tell me about those Daedric Anchors."
"204987124-0-14275";"Tell me what I want to know first."
"204987124-0-14277";"I'll tell her."
"204987124-0-14278";"Sheogorath summoned him."
"204987124-0-14279";"I don't understand. Tell me about this bargain."
"204987124-0-14280";"So he didn't adhere to his part of the bargain."
"204987124-0-14281";"I know precisely how I'm going to deal with you."
"204987124-0-14282";"Your son followed you here, you know."
"204987124-0-14284";"Why did some of the prisoners go feral?"
"204987124-0-14285";"Why did some of the prisoners go feral?"
"204987124-0-14286";"I've heard rumors of a curse here."
"204987124-0-14287";"I'll find the supplies."
"204987124-0-14290";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-14294";"Is it true that Darvasen used to be your assistant?"
"204987124-0-14296";"I won't forget you."
"204987124-0-14298";"You don't have to give me a present."
"204987124-0-14302";"Surely you don't expect me to believe that."
"204987124-0-14304";"Sheogorath cursed the tome. Shalidor can't read it."
"204987124-0-14306";"I will."
"204987124-0-14308";"Yes, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-14309";"They're still here."
"204987124-0-14311";"<<1>> wants the totem returned to her."
"204987124-0-14312";"Stay here until I bring that totem back."
"204987124-0-14313";"Uhh, sure. Do you know the ""Song of Sinmur""?"
"204987124-0-14316";"Eaten?"
"204987124-0-14318";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-14325";"How does the totem give <<1>> control over the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-14327";"If we destroyed it, what would happen?"
"204987124-0-14328";"How does the totem give <<1>> control over the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-14329";"Where's the totem now?"
"204987124-0-14330";"I didn't find any."
"204987124-0-14332";"No, I ratted on you. He says you're as good as dead."
"204987124-0-14334";"Is he a threat?"
"204987124-0-14335";"Yes."
"204987124-0-14336";"What now?"
"204987124-0-14337";"What now?"
"204987124-0-14338";"Yes, I have killed <<1>>."
"204987124-0-14339";"Yes."
"204987124-0-14340";"I have killed the leader to death."
"204987124-0-14346";"I'd like to know more about Shalidor."
"204987124-0-14347";"Why would he be criticized?"
"204987124-0-14352";"Just give me the reward."
"204987124-0-14353";"Ah, good. Now about my reward…"
"204987124-0-14354";"Really?"
"204987124-0-14357";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-14365";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-14367";"We could accomplish both things."
"204987124-0-14368";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-14369";"But your guidelines extend to this alchemist?"
"204987124-0-14370";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-14371";"The Shivering Isles?"
"204987124-0-14373";"What happens if they find out who you really are?"
"204987124-0-14374";"I know the lyrics and melody. I learned them from your fellow bards."
"204987124-0-14375";"What will you do if I set you free?"
"204987124-0-14376";"You'd fight the Pact, even if I let you go?"
"204987124-0-14377";"Where will you go if I set you free?"
"204987124-0-14379";"What do these orbs do?"
"204987124-0-14380";"I leave the decision to you, vicecanon."
"204987124-0-14381";"I leave the decision to you, vicecanon."
"204987124-0-14383";"Yes. Death to all traitors. [Kazdi dies]"
"204987124-0-14388";"She's a turncoat who outlived her usefulness. Kill her."
"204987124-0-14395";"Tell me everything."
"204987124-0-14396";"Aye."
"204987124-0-14399";"How so?"
"204987124-0-14400";"I'm a friend. I was sent from the outpost by .…"
"204987124-0-14402";"I thought the Maulborn were almost wiped out."
"204987124-0-14405";"Why am I doing this?"
"204987124-0-14411";"You seem obsessed with hearts."
"204987124-0-14412";"Where have you been?"
"204987124-0-14415";"The play is about the alliances?"
"204987124-0-14418";"Thank you, Haskill."
"204987124-0-14420";"I'll bring the hearts there, Belron."
"204987124-0-14422";"All right."
"204987124-0-14424";"Oath? What oath?"
"204987124-0-14425";"I'm supposed to fight the whole alliance?"
"204987124-0-14426";"How did the <<1>> compel you?"
"204987124-0-14427";"<<aC:1>>? What is that?"
"204987124-0-14428";"If they're at peace, what do I do?"
"204987124-0-14429";"And my role is to kill more of your actors?"
"204987124-0-14432";"I suppose. What do I do in this last act?"
"204987124-0-14434";"I have no idea."
"204987124-0-14435";"We had a deal."
"204987124-0-14437";"How do I get out of here?"
"204987124-0-14440";"I'll find <<1>>. Head back to your family."
"204987124-0-14441";"Your father sent me."
"204987124-0-14442";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-14448";"How did the Khajiit find this place?"
"204987124-0-14452";"Where do I find The Eyes?"
"204987124-0-14453";"Where do I find The Eyes?"
"204987124-0-14455";"I'll find The Eyes Of Yokuda and bring them to you."
"204987124-0-14456";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-14466";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-14468";"Tavo is dead. I collected these relics on his behalf."
"204987124-0-14470";"Here. Take the relics and leave her alone."
"204987124-0-14472";"Good plan."
"204987124-0-14475";"Take the totem and lead the Goblins to freedom."
"204987124-0-14482";"Take the totem and do what's needed."
"204987124-0-14496";"Give me the Fang and save yourself."
"204987124-0-14497";"How do I put a stop to this?"
"204987124-0-14499";"You swore to protect your liege lord, not old pottery."
"204987124-0-14502";"Where'd he take them?"
"204987124-0-14504";"Do you want me to drink the elixir?"
"204987124-0-14505";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-14508";"No. You died centuries ago."
"204987124-0-14510";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-14513";"The Hist told me the Dominion mages were stealing memories."
"204987124-0-14515";"I'll talk to him."
"204987124-0-14516";"A vacation?"
"204987124-0-14517";"All right. What's first?"
"204987124-0-14520";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-14521";"So I have to navigate a maze? Why?"
"204987124-0-14522";"Whatever you say."
"204987124-0-14527";"Do you know who they are?"
"204987124-0-14529";"An old man in robes appeared to me. He said his name was Shalidor?"
"204987124-0-14530";"How did you learn about these books?"
"204987124-0-14533";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-14534";"Yes. Let's begin."
"204987124-0-14536";"<<AC:1>> has what's missing?"
"204987124-0-14542";"I'll restore the bodies."
"204987124-0-14545";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-14551";"I'm supposed to evict one of Sheogorath's guests. They're not fitting in."
"204987124-0-14552";"That's it. You're out of here."
"204987124-0-14562";"That's a mansion?"
"204987124-0-14564";"I'll be sure to remember that."
"204987124-0-14565";"A focus?"
"204987124-0-14566";"The contract you mentioned, who placed it?"
"204987124-0-14569";"I guess?"
"204987124-0-14570";"Can I have the short version?"
"204987124-0-14572";"Let's get this over with."
"204987124-0-14573";"That's Lion Guard armor, so you must be Ulrich. Roselle sent me to find you. Remember anything?"
"204987124-0-14575";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-14577";"Valaste, are you all right?"
"204987124-0-14579";"Thank you, Valaste."
"204987124-0-14583";"How can I stop them?"
"204987124-0-14586";"Any suggestions?"
"204987124-0-14588";"Different? How?"
"204987124-0-14589";"Agreed. I'll take care of them both."
"204987124-0-14590";"Why don't you collect them yourself?"
"204987124-0-14591";"Warn them? Why?"
"204987124-0-14596";"I'm supposed to evict one of Sheogorath's guests. They're not fitting in."
"204987124-0-14599";"That's it. You're out of here."
"204987124-0-14600";"I'm supposed to evict one of Sheogorath's guests. They're not fitting in."
"204987124-0-14603";"That's it. You're out of here."
"204987124-0-14604";"Someone has desecrated your shrine."
"204987124-0-14605";"What does the wand do?"
"204987124-0-14607";"Did you see battle while you were in command?"
"204987124-0-14608";"What's your disagreement about?"
"204987124-0-14609";"Are we still fighting the Akaviri?"
"204987124-0-14610";"What is the Pact?"
"204987124-0-14611";"What does your brother say, exactly?"
"204987124-0-14612";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-14613";"Please, explain."
"204987124-0-14615";"You said you can read Yokudan inscriptions?"
"204987124-0-14617";"How can we heal <<A:1>>?"
"204987124-0-14618";"No one has ever tried to get in?"
"204987124-0-14620";"Did you see battle while you were in command?"
"204987124-0-14621";"How long has this cave been haunted?"
"204987124-0-14622";"Tell me about Eiman."
"204987124-0-14624";"More pages? I'll take those, thanks."
"204987124-0-14625";"Now what will you do?"
"204987124-0-14627";"Now what will you do?"
"204987124-0-14639";"I've heard rumors of a curse here."
"204987124-0-14640";"Did you lose your toes to a crab?"
"204987124-0-14642";"Have you lived here long?"
"204987124-0-14644";"Isn't it cold to go without a shirt?"
"204987124-0-14648";"Do you enjoy the work?"
"204987124-0-14649";"Who's Otroggar?"
"204987124-0-14650";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-14652";"Did you kill Jofnir, or not?"
"204987124-0-14655";"And you had to kill him?"
"204987124-0-14656";"Then why do you live here?"
"204987124-0-14665";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-14668";"I've come to claim the Cartulary."
"204987124-0-14670";"I choose the trial of combat."
"204987124-0-14671";"How can I prove my worth?"
"204987124-0-14672";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-14673";"I'll give the Cartulary to the rightful heirs of the Ra Gada, you have my word."
"204987124-0-14674";"I understand."
"204987124-0-14675";"What about Paldeen? He's a Redguard."
"204987124-0-14676";"Thank you, your majesty."
"204987124-0-14679";"Then I choose the trial of combat."
"204987124-0-14680";"It's about time."
"204987124-0-14685";"I won your game. Now let Eiman go."
"204987124-0-14686";"Safe from what?"
"204987124-0-14687";"You're talking about a cave-in."
"204987124-0-14688";"Eiman will die if you don't release him."
"204987124-0-14689";"I don't want your friends. I just want Eiman."
"204987124-0-14690";"What about this rune? Don't you want it back?"
"204987124-0-14691";"Eiman will die if you don't release him."
"204987124-0-14692";"Eiman will die if you don't release him."
"204987124-0-14693";"So nobody wants to be caught in a bear trap. Not even squirrels."
"204987124-0-14696";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-14698";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-14715";"Why did you come here?"
"204987124-0-14716";"So you mainly live on dairy?"
"204987124-0-14717";"Why did a farmer move to Bleakrock?"
"204987124-0-14719";"Yes. I was shipwrecked. That's it."
"204987124-0-14720";"What do you mean, ""if it comes back?"""
"204987124-0-14721";"What do you mean, ""if it comes back?"""
"204987124-0-14722";"What do you think I should do?"
"204987124-0-14723";"I didn't notice you had a caravel here."
"204987124-0-14724";"It hasn't been seen since?"
"204987124-0-14725";"What do you mean, ""if it comes back?"""
"204987124-0-14726";"You greeted me as if we'd met."
"204987124-0-14727";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-14730";"I need more information before I set out."
"204987124-0-14731";"Let's get out of here, Eiman."
"204987124-0-14732";"Who are the Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-14733";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-14736";"Do you know <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-14739";"I'll stand with you, Shalidor."
"204987124-0-14741";"Any idea who set these fires?"
"204987124-0-14742";"Where have you been?"
"204987124-0-14743";"Where have you been?"
"204987124-0-14745";"Do you know anything about  <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-14746";"Do you know <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-14747";"Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-14749";"Where should I start looking?"
"204987124-0-14750";"What is Skyshroud Barrow?"
"204987124-0-14754";"Why is this place called Hozzin's Folly?"
"204987124-0-14755";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-14757";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-14759";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-14763";"Tell me more information."
"204987124-0-14764";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-14765";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-14770";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-14772";"So this is another trial, then?"
"204987124-0-14778";"I'll look for them, Molla."
"204987124-0-14779";"The necromancer at Skyshroud Barrow wore a Covenant uniform."
"204987124-0-14780";"Let's leave now. We can't wait any longer."
"204987124-0-14781";"How can we evacuate without a ship?"
"204987124-0-14782";"How can we evacuate without a ship?"
"204987124-0-14783";"How can we evacuate without a ship?"
"204987124-0-14784";"Yes, I'm sure. It's time to leave."
"204987124-0-14786";"I'll start at Skyshroud Barrow."
"204987124-0-14787";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-14788";"I'll start at Orkey's Hollow."
"204987124-0-14789";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-14790";"I'll start at Hozzin's Folly."
"204987124-0-14791";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-14792";"Where are they?"
"204987124-0-14793";"I will. How can I get into the barrow?"
"204987124-0-14794";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-14799";"She wants the totem back to enslave the Goblins again."
"204987124-0-14800";"He said he knew there were only a few people in the guild that could translate the books."
"204987124-0-14801";"What are those plumes?"
"204987124-0-14802";"What can you tell me about the island?"
"204987124-0-14803";"Any thoughts? Is there some kind of trick to it?"
"204987124-0-14806";"<<1>> tried to save the eggs, not destroy them."
"204987124-0-14807";"Dark robes? Were they cultists?"
"204987124-0-14808";"How long have you reported to Captain Rana?"
"204987124-0-14813";"What will happen to the Hist? To you?"
"204987124-0-14815";"See you there."
"204987124-0-14816";"Why are you so focused on Valaste?"
"204987124-0-14817";"Wait, what did you mean about Valaste?"
"204987124-0-14818";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-14824";"A Dremora named <<1>> was responsible."
"204987124-0-14827";"We'll see it done."
"204987124-0-14831";"How do we escape?"
"204987124-0-14832";"Why do you say this place is terrible?"
"204987124-0-14836";"What can you tell me about the foreman?"
"204987124-0-14837";"Why did you say this place was terrible?"
"204987124-0-14838";"What can you tell me about the foreman?"
"204987124-0-14839";"What can you tell me about the foreman?"
"204987124-0-14840";"Is she safe?"
"204987124-0-14842";"Open the gate. I'll rescue Lyris."
"204987124-0-14843";"Workers? Just like the Argonians were ""workers,"" I assume."
"204987124-0-14844";"I don't appreciate your tone. Maybe I should just leave you to deal with these Goblins yourself."
"204987124-0-14845";"Who are the Chimer?"
"204987124-0-14848";"As we dealt with the portals, she began to become more agitated. Raving."
"204987124-0-14849";"I'll take care of him."
"204987124-0-14851";"All right. I'll kill you, if it's the only way to save you."
"204987124-0-14853";"Who is Ysgramor?"
"204987124-0-14856";"Let's get going."
"204987124-0-14861";"We saw a projection of Sai Sahan. He spoke to us."
"204987124-0-14862";"One last thing. Why did Molag Bal leave Lyris any possibility of escape?"
"204987124-0-14863";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-14864";"What is our next course of action?"
"204987124-0-14865";"Are you going to be okay?"
"204987124-0-14866";"How can the Amulet do that?"
"204987124-0-14868";"Where did you say we are?"
"204987124-0-14869";"Where did you find me?"
"204987124-0-14870";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-14871";"What does Tillrani have against you?"
"204987124-0-14872";"Could you tell me about the races of the Pact?"
"204987124-0-14873";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-14874";"What does Tillrani have against you?"
"204987124-0-14875";"Can you tell me about the Nords?"
"204987124-0-14876";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-14877";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-14878";"Can you tell me about the Nords?"
"204987124-0-14879";"What does Tillrani have against you?"
"204987124-0-14880";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-14881";"Can you tell me about the Nords?"
"204987124-0-14887";"What will happen to the Hist? To you?"
"204987124-0-14893";"He's planning to fight his way here to rescue you."
"204987124-0-14894";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-14896";"I'll warn the vicecanon."
"204987124-0-14897";"What's a skin-stealer?"
"204987124-0-14903";"No vicecanon was involved with the skin-stealing."
"204987124-0-14944";"Tell me how I can help."
"204987124-0-14950";"Go."

"204987124-0-15582";"Thanks for the tip, I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-15585";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-15586";"I guessed who you are. Let Eiman go."
"204987124-0-15587";"Thanks for the tip, I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-15590";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-15591";"Uh….hmmmm…ok"
"204987124-0-15593";"All right. One more game."
"204987124-0-15595";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-15598";"I'll start."
"204987124-0-15599";"What should I do first?"
"204987124-0-15601";"I'll get started."
"204987124-0-15604";"Very good, I'll do that!"
"204987124-0-15607";"Makes sense."
"204987124-0-15608";"Very good, I'll do that!"
"204987124-0-15611";"Sorry about that…"
"204987124-0-15612";"Uh….hmmmm…ok"
"204987124-0-15615";"You mentioned a celebration?"
"204987124-0-15636";"<<1>> mentioned scouting reports?"
"204987124-0-15638";"And that's where I come in."
"204987124-0-15639";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-15640";"Right away, Prince Irnskar."
"204987124-0-15641";"Where do we find the shaman?"
"204987124-0-15644";"How can I get inside the barracks?"
"204987124-0-15663";"Someone encouraged you to do this? Who?"
"204987124-0-15664";"I'm going to assault their encampment."
"204987124-0-15666";"What needs to happen to change the story back?"
"204987124-0-15669";"You're right. It's disgusting stuff. Only fit for Nords. Let me take it off your hands."
"204987124-0-15670";"What did you say about this place?"
"204987124-0-15671";"Hold on. I'm here to help."
"204987124-0-15677";"Thank you, Sadal."
"204987124-0-15678";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-15679";"How can I stop <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-15680";"What part do I play in this?"
"204987124-0-15681";"I'll see what the past has to show me."
"204987124-0-15684";"Good luck, Sadal."
"204987124-0-15685";"Now what?"
"204987124-0-15689";"Why don't you explain now?"
"204987124-0-15690";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-15692";"Actually, she sent me for the shalk glands."
"204987124-0-15705";"Curator Nicholas said that the items we burned on the altar were fed to the Bad Man."
"204987124-0-15711";"Is there a way out of here?"
"204987124-0-15712";"I have a few more questions."
"204987124-0-15714";"How can I destroy the roots?"
"204987124-0-15717";"Anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-15718";"Is the goat stew tasty?"
"204987124-0-15719";"What would you need for your stew?"
"204987124-0-15721";"Do you have bear steaks?"
"204987124-0-15724";"Yes…I did, kinda."
"204987124-0-15725";"I'll go find Ralduf."
"204987124-0-15726";"I'm confused. What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-15728";"You view the wolves as friends?"
"204987124-0-15731";"I thought there was a bard here."
"204987124-0-15733";"I'll go find Ralduf."
"204987124-0-15734";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-15736";"So you'll play for us now?"
"204987124-0-15743";"How can I stop <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-15744";"Do you throw these celebrations often?"
"204987124-0-15745";"What part do I play in this?"
"204987124-0-15750";"I came here to help the spinners repair this story."
"204987124-0-15751";"I will. Tell me what we need to do."
"204987124-0-15752";"What are the necromancers doing?"
"204987124-0-15755";"How do the necromancers plan to enslave them?"
"204987124-0-15772";"Who killed whom?"
"204987124-0-15778";"I burned all I could find."
"204987124-0-15779";"What are the necromancers planning?"
"204987124-0-15781";"Who is Z'en?"
"204987124-0-15782";"How can he help?"
"204987124-0-15785";"I'll go find him."
"204987124-0-15786";"Care to join me?"
"204987124-0-15789";"So you didn't notice anything unusual?"
"204987124-0-15791";"The attackers were singing?"
"204987124-0-15795";"Will the dust cure her?"
"204987124-0-15796";"Are you pleased to be a Centurion again?"
"204987124-0-15798";"We need to find a way into the castle."
"204987124-0-15799";"You'll let her go? Just like that?"
"204987124-0-15800";"No. She seems fine. I can't risk her life."
"204987124-0-15801";"If you're lying to me, I'll hunt you and your clan down."
"204987124-0-15802";"Don't make me regret my decision."
"204987124-0-15805";"Thank you, Sir Cadwell."
"204987124-0-15806";"We need to rescue Abnur Tharn. It's complicated."
"204987124-0-15807";"Does this help your memory?"
"204987124-0-15809";"<<1>> is dead. He threatened to kill <<2>>."
"204987124-0-15812";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-15814";"But did you see anything?"
"204987124-0-15818";"Are you and Runs-in-Wild still getting along?"
"204987124-0-15823";"How are the Earth-Turners fitting in?"
"204987124-0-15824";"Is anyone else searching for her?"
"204987124-0-15825";"Hoknir's a part of your command, then?"
"204987124-0-15826";"How are the Earth-Turners fitting in?"
"204987124-0-15827";"How are the Earth-Turners fitting in?"
"204987124-0-15828";"How are the Earth-Turners fitting in?"
"204987124-0-15829";"How did this start?"
"204987124-0-15831";"Where should I start my search?"
"204987124-0-15832";"I'll catch up with the others."
"204987124-0-15835";"A friend. <<1>> gave me this totem."
"204987124-0-15836";"No, she sent me to retrieve it. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with it."
"204987124-0-15837";"There's got to be more at work than this."
"204987124-0-15838";"Very well. I'll find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-15839";"Maybe I'll drain the rest until you tell me something useful."
"204987124-0-15843";"How are the Earth-Turners working out?"
"204987124-0-15848";"What do you think of Molla's contribution?"
"204987124-0-15849";"How are the Earth-Turners working out?"
"204987124-0-15850";"How are the Earth-Turners working out?"
"204987124-0-15851";"How are the Earth-Turners working out?"
"204987124-0-15852";"Whoever took her can't have gone far."
"204987124-0-15855";"Why can't you save the hunters like you did Imhey?"
"204987124-0-15857";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-15859";"We need to find that bard."
"204987124-0-15861";"I'll find the bard."
"204987124-0-15862";"The hunters won't mind getting splashed with this?"
"204987124-0-15863";"Creatures? What sort of creatures."
"204987124-0-15866";"Where did they take him?"
"204987124-0-15869";"You remember what happened. Why doesn't anyone else?"
"204987124-0-15871";"How can you speak to giants?"
"204987124-0-15873";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-15874";"Why are the Stormfists fighting the giants?"
"204987124-0-15875";"How can you speak to giants?"
"204987124-0-15877";"People died because of your lute!"
"204987124-0-15888";"If you promise to surrender yourself to the royal workers, I'll open the cage."
"204987124-0-15889";"The lute put people to sleep so he could rob them."
"204987124-0-15891";"I'll get that sack."
"204987124-0-15892";"Who's Ulrich?"
"204987124-0-15894";"How can <<1>> help?"
"204987124-0-15903";"Who's Ulrich?"
"204987124-0-15904";"How'd you escape?"
"204987124-0-15905";"What about the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-15907";"What's this curse <<1>> spoke of?"
"204987124-0-15908";"How am I going to get into the fort?"
"204987124-0-15910";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-15911";"Perhaps I could reason with him."
"204987124-0-15912";"I'm sorry, but it must be this way."
"204987124-0-15914";"I'll try to persuade him to abandon the curse."
"204987124-0-15915";"There must be a way to stop it."
"204987124-0-15916";"How do I use the totem?"
"204987124-0-15918";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-15920";"Don't worry. I'll get you out."
"204987124-0-15921";"How did you get here so fast?"
"204987124-0-15922";"Will you go in there with me?"
"204987124-0-15930";"I left him to his fate after I destroyed the lute."
"204987124-0-15931";"Where do I find Majorn?"
"204987124-0-15934";"Here. I hope it helps."
"204987124-0-15935";"I wouldn't have been able to do it without your totem."
"204987124-0-15939";"I'll talk to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-15943";"I'll destroy the heartwood for you."
"204987124-0-15944";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-15945";"<Place Lothgar's sword and shield beside his body.>"
"204987124-0-15947";"Maybe you shouldn't send Rala."
"204987124-0-15950";"This isn't what Valeric taught you."
"204987124-0-15953";"Not this way. You're better than this. You can control it."
"204987124-0-15961";"What is an Oathbreaker?"
"204987124-0-15967";"You think they were monsters?"
"204987124-0-15968";"How can the Hound be removed?"
"204987124-0-15971";"What am I seeing?"
"204987124-0-15973";"You two will be great in the guild."
"204987124-0-15976";"You don't need the Mages Guild. You're an excellent treasure hunter."
"204987124-0-15980";"Wasn't he your last follower?"
"204987124-0-15985";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-15988";"What will you all do now?"
"204987124-0-15993";"And how does that work out?"
"204987124-0-15994";"Can you remember anything at all?"
"204987124-0-15995";"What do you want from me?"
"204987124-0-15998";"You just expect me to take your word and kill your son?"
"204987124-0-16009";"The Drublog have suffered losses as well. It's up to you to end this."
"204987124-0-16011";"Your daughter gave everything to bring an end to this. Don't let her sacrifice be in vain."
"204987124-0-16012";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-16014";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-16015";"And this power you would give me?"
"204987124-0-16017";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-16027";"Has the King Jorunn recovered from the poison?"
"204987124-0-16034";"Has King Jorunn recovered from the poison?"
"204987124-0-16035";"Are the Pact leaders getting along with Prince Irnskar?"
"204987124-0-16036";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-16037";"What did you summon?"
"204987124-0-16039";"I'll bring you Bitterblade's head."
"204987124-0-16040";"The Prince has learned from his mistakes. He nearly lost his father."
"204987124-0-16042";"Is this all the work of the Bad Man?"
"204987124-0-16043";"Why exactly did you summon this thing?"
"204987124-0-16044";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-16045";"But how is all of this inside a cave in Daggerfall harbor?"
"204987124-0-16046";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-16047";"Where are we?"
"204987124-0-16048";"Do you always let strangers participate in the festival?"
"204987124-0-16050";"Do you really believe this offering will bring a good harvest?"
"204987124-0-16051";"What did he do?"
"204987124-0-16052";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-16054";"What are the necromancers doing?"
"204987124-0-16060";"I trust him. He saved the lives of many of his people."
"204987124-0-16061";"I collected the blood of a vampire."
"204987124-0-16064";"I need to speak to her on behalf of Prince Irnskar."
"204987124-0-16067";"Any suggestions on how I should approach this?"
"204987124-0-16070";"Pretty much."
"204987124-0-16073";"Thank you for considering his request."
"204987124-0-16081";"I'll tell him, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-16089";"And now?"
"204987124-0-16093";"You're Sahun? Son of Ormi the Keeper?"
"204987124-0-16094";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-16095";"All right. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-16097";"I was just curious."
"204987124-0-16104";"Lets go."
"204987124-0-16112";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-16122";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-16124";"Can we send Prince Irnskar into the dream to help his father?"
"204987124-0-16127";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-16128";"What is the Sphere of Storms?"
"204987124-0-16129";"What is the Sphere of Storms?"
"204987124-0-16130";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-16131";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-16136";"Where is your family?"
"204987124-0-16138";"I'll find them for you."
"204987124-0-16139";"Interesting. I'll go get that sack."
"204987124-0-16140";"How can a monkey help?"
"204987124-0-16142";"Here they are."
"204987124-0-16146";"He was injured. He sent me to check the cabins."
"204987124-0-16147";"What travelers?"
"204987124-0-16148";"What did they do to the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-16150";"All right. You're coming with me."
"204987124-0-16151";"Why is Fildgor interested in this mine?"
"204987124-0-16152";"What's Jomund doing in the mine?"
"204987124-0-16153";"What did you see?"
"204987124-0-16155";"Come with me. We're going to get that ritual book."
"204987124-0-16156";"When did Shadowfen get vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-16157";"Why didn't you just flee when the Stormfist soldiers arrived?"
"204987124-0-16159";"What will that accomplish?"
"204987124-0-16160";"Tell me about the Fox."
"204987124-0-16164";"Tell me about the Bear."
"204987124-0-16165";"Tell me about the Fox."
"204987124-0-16166";"Tell me about the Fox."
"204987124-0-16172";"<Close book>"
"204987124-0-16174";"You're lying."
"204987124-0-16175";"She asked me to give you these weapons."
"204987124-0-16177";"What can I do next?"
"204987124-0-16178";"Where would I get one of the Stormfist uniforms?"
"204987124-0-16179";"What did it do to the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-16180";"Come on. We're going to get that book."
"204987124-0-16183";"So far, you're the only survivor I've come across."
"204987124-0-16185";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-16186";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-16195";"What kind of questions?"
"204987124-0-16196";"Until what?"
"204987124-0-16197";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-16198";"What do you think they did?"
"204987124-0-16199";"Where did they go?"
"204987124-0-16201";"How do I follow the King?"
"204987124-0-16203";"Tell me about the aspects of your gods."
"204987124-0-16211";"I can fight. The Silvenar needs good advice."
"204987124-0-16212";"Let me help you."
"204987124-0-16214";"I'll consider your words. Thank you."
"204987124-0-16215";"I may need help getting the Silvenar out of here."
"204987124-0-16218";"I'll consider your words. Thank you."
"204987124-0-16220";"I'll consider your words. Thank you."
"204987124-0-16221";"You've given me much to think about. Thanks."
"204987124-0-16222";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-16223";"So how can I help?"
"204987124-0-16224";"What does the right switch do?"
"204987124-0-16225";"You're with the Covenant. Tell me what you're doing here. Now."
"204987124-0-16226";"I'll help you if you tell me the truth."
"204987124-0-16229";"Thanks a lot. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-16231";"Then I'll go to those towers. What do I do when I get there?"
"204987124-0-16232";"Who are the vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-16234";"Is there anything more you can do to help?"
"204987124-0-16235";"Then I'll go to those towers. What do I do when I get there?"
"204987124-0-16236";"Stormhold's Vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-16238";"Is there anything more you can do to help?"
"204987124-0-16241";"It's not my place to judge. Jorunn the Skald-King will decide your fate."
"204987124-0-16243";"What can you tell me about Stormhold?"
"204987124-0-16244";"Very well."
"204987124-0-16249";"Fildgor brought this on himself, King Jorunn."
"204987124-0-16262";"I won't fail."
"204987124-0-16264";"What else do you need?"
"204987124-0-16266";"Tell me about the aspects of your gods."
"204987124-0-16267";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-16268";"Why did the Worm Cult attack?"
"204987124-0-16269";"How did you get in there?"
"204987124-0-16271";"I'm ready. Let them come."
"204987124-0-16273";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-16274";"What are the stormwardens?"
"204987124-0-16280";"What is the Sphere of Storms?"
"204987124-0-16281";"What are the stormwardens?"
"204987124-0-16283";"Where can I find the storm atronachs?"
"204987124-0-16284";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-16287";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-16288";"The Pact commander? I thought Viveka was with the guard."
"204987124-0-16291";"Why do you think this will work?"
"204987124-0-16292";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-16293";"Where is King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-16294";"I can investigate, then."
"204987124-0-16296";"The Pact commander? I thought Viveka was with the guard."
"204987124-0-16297";"I'll find him and get us out of here."
"204987124-0-16302";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-16303";"Do you know where they're coming from?"
"204987124-0-16308";"Yes. It smells like… death."
"204987124-0-16309";"Do you know where they're coming from?"
"204987124-0-16311";"Yes. It smells like… death."
"204987124-0-16316";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-16317";"Can you help us?"
"204987124-0-16319";"Which way did he go?"
"204987124-0-16321";"You would let your order fail? I've never seen such a useless leader."
"204987124-0-16323";"Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-16327";"No, I'm not ready yet."
"204987124-0-16330";"I won't dawdle."
"204987124-0-16331";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-16333";"It's a mysterious, glowing metal. It attracts trolls."
"204987124-0-16334";"Do you know what it is?"
"204987124-0-16337";"And if that works?"
"204987124-0-16338";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-16342";"Come on, then. Let's finish this."
"204987124-0-16348";"Come on, then. Let's finish this."
"204987124-0-16354";"I'll enter battle beside a warrior."
"204987124-0-16358";"You need a book? How long is this going to take?"
"204987124-0-16360";"Helping you can be hazardous."
"204987124-0-16362";"You're not concerned about this?"
"204987124-0-16363";"I hope things settle down now."
"204987124-0-16365";"Anger?"
"204987124-0-16367";"I burned the roots below using these shalk glands."
"204987124-0-16370";"I need your help."
"204987124-0-16373";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-16375";"Do you smell cinnamon?"
"204987124-0-16376";"Can you tell me more about the <<mz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-16377";"The Silvenar wants me to get some of those shards."
"204987124-0-16378";"What can you tell me about these <<mz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-16379";"Why don't you collect the shards?"
"204987124-0-16380";"If it's only temporary, what will that accomplish?"
"204987124-0-16381";"Where can I find the three spinners?"
"204987124-0-16389";"What's Jomund doing in the mine?"
"204987124-0-16390";"Tell me what you know and we'll see."
"204987124-0-16392";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-16394";"What can you tell me about the bonds that hold her?"
"204987124-0-16395";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-16396";"How?"
"204987124-0-16401";"It's safely destroyed. And <<1>> should be at the cave's exit by now."
"204987124-0-16402";"What goes into rotmeth?"
"204987124-0-16403";"What do I do with this thing?"
"204987124-0-16404";"You drink liquor made out of meat and bugs?"
"204987124-0-16405";"Rotmeth's used in wedding ceremonies?"
"204987124-0-16407";"What goes into rotmeth?"
"204987124-0-16408";"I rescued <<1>> and some of your crew."
"204987124-0-16409";"The Silvenar needs you to lower the city's defenses."
"204987124-0-16413";"Will these <<mz:1>> help?"
"204987124-0-16416";"How was <<1>> bound?"
"204987124-0-16417";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-16419";"Why'd he laugh?"
"204987124-0-16420";"Where's <<1>> now?"
"204987124-0-16421";"What kind of trouble?"
"204987124-0-16423";"How do the patterns end?"
"204987124-0-16428";"What are you talking about? Where are the clothes?"
"204987124-0-16430";"Then what's he here for?"
"204987124-0-16432";"Are you missing a guard?"
"204987124-0-16436";"Need her? For what?"
"204987124-0-16438";"What?"
"204987124-0-16439";"Is there anything in particular I should look for?"
"204987124-0-16445";"Do you know where he went?"
"204987124-0-16449";"I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner."
"204987124-0-16451";"She took two of these <<mz:1>> as well."
"204987124-0-16452";"<Let Guard Thod sleep it off.>"
"204987124-0-16454";"Should you postpone this meeting?"
"204987124-0-16455";"I know who I found."
"204987124-0-16461";"I'm often surprised by what you spinners say."
"204987124-0-16462";"Or what?"
"204987124-0-16464";"Wait, what? You want me to kill the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-16465";"All right. I'm off."
"204987124-0-16468";"Memories?"
"204987124-0-16471";"Open this door or I'll tear this whole place apart!"
"204987124-0-16473";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16474";"You sent me to find Thod. We talked about it on the bridge."
"204987124-0-16476";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16478";"<Press the axe.>"
"204987124-0-16479";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16480";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16481";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16482";"<Press the sword.>"
"204987124-0-16483";"No. Yjarnn's body is in Marla's house. Along with Marla and, well, Marla, and some others."
"204987124-0-16485";"Fildgor's spies have infiltrated Fort Amol!"
"204987124-0-16487";"Where can I find the pickled fish?"
"204987124-0-16488";"Where can I find the mead?"
"204987124-0-16489";"Where can I find the pickled fish?"
"204987124-0-16490";"Where can I find the pickled fish?"
"204987124-0-16491";"I'm surprised you can spare the fish."
"204987124-0-16492";"I'm surprised you can spare the fish."
"204987124-0-16497";"Fine. If you won't help me, I'll find the clothes myself."
"204987124-0-16498";"The registrars who wouldn't let us into the city, right."
"204987124-0-16499";"I need the clothes."
"204987124-0-16500";"Why don't you collect the shards?"
"204987124-0-16505";"Fine. If you won't help me, I'll find the clothes myself."
"204987124-0-16506";"Why don't you collect the shards?"
"204987124-0-16507";"What defense does the city have?"
"204987124-0-16508";"Can you tell me more about the <<mz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-16510";"Why the concern about these Goblins? What does a totem have to do with this?"
"204987124-0-16511";"I'll check out the mine."
"204987124-0-16513";"Yes, I was at Boulderfall."
"204987124-0-16514";"Is there anything else you can tell me about the attack?"
"204987124-0-16515";"Gjakil? Is your husband a captain in the Pact military?"
"204987124-0-16516";"Where did the giants come from?"
"204987124-0-16517";"Doesn't it make you nervous, living so close to a giant camp?"
"204987124-0-16518";"Gjakil? Is your husband a captain in the Pact military?"
"204987124-0-16519";"No."
"204987124-0-16520";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-16522";"Tell them the truth."
"204987124-0-16523";"You should head back to the settlement."
"204987124-0-16526";"You skipped the part about you actually being a thief, didn't you?"
"204987124-0-16529";"Aera and I met at Bal Foyen."
"204987124-0-16530";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-16531";"I need to convince Gelds to return to the Prince's meeting."
"204987124-0-16532";"What's in this for you?"
"204987124-0-16533";"What can a servant do to help me?"
"204987124-0-16534";"Have you been part of the royal work team long?"
"204987124-0-16535";"You haven't learned anything, then?"
"204987124-0-16538";"He said he's close to uncovering what the cult wants."
"204987124-0-16539";"He didn't say. He needed to examine a book in the thane's library."
"204987124-0-16540";"Will you be all right if I leave you here?"
"204987124-0-16541";"Where's Aera now?"
"204987124-0-16544";"Any idea what the Cultists are doing?"
"204987124-0-16548";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-16549";"Where should I look?"
"204987124-0-16553";"There must be some way I can convince you to return to the Prince."
"204987124-0-16555";"This is for King Jorunn, not Prince Irnskar."
"204987124-0-16559";"I've been to Valeguard and met some of the spinners."
"204987124-0-16562";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-16564";"What kind of acts do you perform?"
"204987124-0-16565";"Are you all performers?"
"204987124-0-16567";"Where's the third spinner? Should I give her the last two shards?"
"204987124-0-16568";"I'll head to the throne room now. Wish me luck."
"204987124-0-16570";"What happened to Sela's husband?"
"204987124-0-16574";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-16577";"Sounds like it's going to be quite a battle."
"204987124-0-16579";"You can count on me."
"204987124-0-16580";"The giants?"
"204987124-0-16582";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-16584";"All right."
"204987124-0-16586";"I'm right behind you."
"204987124-0-16587";"Where would I make an offering? What would I offer?"
"204987124-0-16588";"Tell me what happens if I pull the right switch."
"204987124-0-16591";"Let's not waste any more time."
"204987124-0-16592";"You're injured, Gjakil. I should challenge the chieftain."
"204987124-0-16593";"Just making conversation."
"204987124-0-16596";"Shouldn't you do something?"
"204987124-0-16604";"Why are you out here?"
"204987124-0-16606";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-16609";"I could help you get past the spriggans."
"204987124-0-16610";"Then I'll go disturb the roots."
"204987124-0-16612";"What have you heard about Prince Irnskar?"
"204987124-0-16616";"Fildgor's spies have infiltrated Fort Amol and killed a handful of Nords and Dark Elves."
"204987124-0-16617";"There must be something I can do to convince you."
"204987124-0-16625";"How did he react when the Pact was signed?"
"204987124-0-16626";"Did you see much action during the skirmish with the Covenant?"
"204987124-0-16627";"Isn't this fort near the border with Stonefalls?"
"204987124-0-16629";"Well, I agreed to help but … what was that about a murder?"
"204987124-0-16630";"It's been taken, Thane."
"204987124-0-16631";"He said we were searching for your father."
"204987124-0-16634";"I take it you want that deed back."
"204987124-0-16636";"With Death-In-Winter gone, maybe the survivors can take back the town."
"204987124-0-16639";"What job?"
"204987124-0-16641";"Then you've heard no rumor of a shard nearby?"
"204987124-0-16642";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-16645";"I'll finish this."
"204987124-0-16651";"Do you know where he is now?"
"204987124-0-16652";"It looks good on you."
"204987124-0-16653";"Are you coming in with me?"
"204987124-0-16657";"That's terrible. What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-16659";"How can that be?"
"204987124-0-16661";"Tell me more. Where are the Keepers, exactly?"
"204987124-0-16666";"Where can I find King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-16669";"What caused this change in him?"
"204987124-0-16673";"What can you tell me about the vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-16674";"Anything else you can tell me about the disappearances?"
"204987124-0-16675";"Anything else you can tell me about the disappearances?"
"204987124-0-16676";"What can you tell me about the vicecanons?"
"204987124-0-16677";"You killed Guard Hloenor?"
"204987124-0-16678";"Changed how?"
"204987124-0-16682";"What about King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-16685";"So why did you call me out here?"
"204987124-0-16686";"Could Unnvald's problems be related to the undead attacks?"
"204987124-0-16687";"Fine. Take the silk."
"204987124-0-16690";"Then all the undead are soldiers who fought over the pass?"
"204987124-0-16691";"Here. Take your silk."
"204987124-0-16694";"What's odd?"
"204987124-0-16695";"Why would the Jarls want to harm Thane Unnvald?"
"204987124-0-16696";"Were you with Unnvald during the attack?"
"204987124-0-16697";"He started raiding after your parents were killed?"
"204987124-0-16698";"Could Unnvald's problems be related to the undead attacks?"
"204987124-0-16699";"It sounds like he was good at it."
"204987124-0-16700";"Could his suspicions be right? Could the Jarls be plotting to kill him?"
"204987124-0-16701";"Which the Jarls now find embarrassing."
"204987124-0-16702";"Could Unnvald's problems be related to the undead attacks?"
"204987124-0-16703";"He must be a Worm Cultist."
"204987124-0-16704";"How did you get in here?"
"204987124-0-16705";"Stay here. I'll get help for the King."
"204987124-0-16706";"What woman?"
"204987124-0-16708";"But you decided to be a hero."
"204987124-0-16709";"I don't know. It's Daedric poison."
"204987124-0-16710";"If you ever need me …."
"204987124-0-16711";"He led your guards into an ambush."
"204987124-0-16712";"Is there any way we can expose him?"
"204987124-0-16714";"I'll return with the sword."
"204987124-0-16715";"He's upstairs. A Dark Elf and an Argonian are protecting him."
"204987124-0-16717";"Fildgor's agents tried to kill me, too."
"204987124-0-16727";"text"
"204987124-0-16746";"I'm on it."
"204987124-0-16749";"The spriggans don't seem to be under your control anymore."
"204987124-0-16751";"What is Cradlecrush?"
"204987124-0-16756";"Strange? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-16757";"We should attack the Stormfists as soon as possible."
"204987124-0-16759";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-16761";"Hurry! They're impatient."
"204987124-0-16763";"Sorry, but I'll need it inside the mine. Give it to me."
"204987124-0-16767";"Then we need to go in."
"204987124-0-16781";"The Thane believed him?"
"204987124-0-16782";"The Thane's in the manor and Thorulf is fleeing?"
"204987124-0-16783";"Thane Unnvald is inside the manor?"
"204987124-0-16784";"Where did Thorulf go?"
"204987124-0-16785";"Thane Unnvald is inside the manor?"
"204987124-0-16786";"I'll try. Do you know where the Reachmen leaders are?"
"204987124-0-16788";"I'll find the relics. Stay safe, Gandis."
"204987124-0-16789";"I've come to help."
"204987124-0-16791";"Or I could stop the Worm Cult."
"204987124-0-16793";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-16794";"The moon and stars? Where would I find those?"
"204987124-0-16797";"Lead on."
"204987124-0-16800";"How?"
"204987124-0-16802";"Don't worry. I'll find the seed."
"204987124-0-16803";"How can I save her?"
"204987124-0-16804";"Take me there."
"204987124-0-16806";"All right."
"204987124-0-16808";"Where are they now?"
"204987124-0-16810";"She needs to be planted in Treehenge, right?"
"204987124-0-16812";"Are you now part of Treehenge?"
"204987124-0-16814";"Lead on, Claurth."
"204987124-0-16818";"You'll have your revenge, Tovisa!"
"204987124-0-16820";"What is this place? Why do the doors look like that?"
"204987124-0-16827";"Have you seen Sela's husband?"
"204987124-0-16828";"Anyone I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-16829";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-16832";"Why do you keep that door locked?"
"204987124-0-16833";"Meat? All I've seen are skeletons and ghosts."
"204987124-0-16834";"Why do you keep that door locked?"
"204987124-0-16837";"You don't like the king?"
"204987124-0-16838";"Talents?"
"204987124-0-16840";"What can you tell me about Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16841";"What are you eating?"
"204987124-0-16842";"What can you tell me about your inn?"
"204987124-0-16843";"Have you heard any interesting rumors?"
"204987124-0-16844";"What can you tell me about your inn?"
"204987124-0-16845";"Where did Danus get the meat?"
"204987124-0-16846";"Have you seen Sela's husband?"
"204987124-0-16847";"Danus said he was infected and had to be banished."
"204987124-0-16848";"Can you tell me anything about Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16849";"Don't you have any interests?"
"204987124-0-16850";"Don't talk much, do you?"
"204987124-0-16851";"Music? Really?"
"204987124-0-16853";"You'll be safe here. I'll find your husband."
"204987124-0-16855";"They have a bard downstairs."
"204987124-0-16856";"So it's a good time to visit Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16857";"What is there to do in Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16858";"So it's a good time to visit Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16859";"What brings you to Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-16861";"What does she think of you?"
"204987124-0-16863";"Have you told her how you feel?"
"204987124-0-16867";"Yes. The shards are magic. Could Thorulf have used it to weaken Thane Unnvald's mind?"
"204987124-0-16871";"There's no need to do this."
"204987124-0-16872";"A token?"
"204987124-0-16873";"Thorulf's the necromancer, not me. We have evidence. Ask Hallfrida."
"204987124-0-16874";"This is a shard of Wuuthrad. It's what I came here for!"
"204987124-0-16877";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-16879";"Thorulf did something to the shard. He used it to muddle your mind."
"204987124-0-16880";"He escaped. I could have saved you, or caught him."
"204987124-0-16888";"Maybe we can talk to her."
"204987124-0-16889";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-16891";"So how can we undo this?"
"204987124-0-16906";"I'll get you out of here."
"204987124-0-16908";"Song?"
"204987124-0-16910";"Sure. Can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-16938";"You think so? I kind of like it."
"204987124-0-16943";"Are you sure that's the only way?"
"204987124-0-16962";"I'm pretty sure I passed a forge on my way here …."
"204987124-0-16966";"What have you done?"
"204987124-0-16967";"Did you know there are two waterfalls in this camp?"
"204987124-0-16968";"I'm pretty sure I passed a forge on my way here …."
"204987124-0-16985";"I intend to, but the way is blocked by a barrier."
"204987124-0-16987";"If you can."
"204987124-0-16994";"If you can."
"204987124-0-16997";"Who are you to ask me to kill her?"
"204987124-0-17000";"Why would they come in and smash up your mine?"
"204987124-0-17007";"Who's occupying the mine now?"
"204987124-0-17008";"Does that mean you'll be paying me in kwama eggs instead of gold?"
"204987124-0-17009";"Boethiah said you were part of the Worm Cult."
"204987124-0-17011";"Why can't you teach me the song?"
"204987124-0-17020";"Why did Engling cause this?"
"204987124-0-17021";"Why can't you teach me the song?"
"204987124-0-17022";"Why did Engling cause this?"
"204987124-0-17023";"If she hasn't been found yet, how will we locate her?"
"204987124-0-17024";"I'm ready, Aelif."
"204987124-0-17026";"No, I shall not follow your path. Begone!"
"204987124-0-17030";"From what I hear, the Silvenar and Green Lady always unite."
"204987124-0-17034";"I can't go into details, but King Jorunn needs everyone back together."
"204987124-0-17035";"Can you help me? I'm trying to convince Gelds to work with the Prince."
"204987124-0-17037";"What can you do?"
"204987124-0-17038";"Any tips on getting in there? You know, as advice for a friend."
"204987124-0-17041";"Thank you. I will see you outside Jathsogur."
"204987124-0-17042";"Thank you. I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-17046";"I'm ready. I'll meet you outside."
"204987124-0-17047";"I'll hurry."
"204987124-0-17050";"What will you be doing while I get the lute?"
"204987124-0-17051";"What was she looking for?"
"204987124-0-17052";"You don't seem worried about me, now."
"204987124-0-17053";"Let's do it."
"204987124-0-17054";"Why didn't you stay in Narsis?"
"204987124-0-17055";"So, you've sought refuge in a crypt teeming with undead?"
"204987124-0-17056";"Why did you try to keep us out?"
"204987124-0-17057";"So we're going to join him?"
"204987124-0-17058";"I'm ready to go if you are."
"204987124-0-17059";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-17060";"I'll let you know what I find."
"204987124-0-17061";"Well, what?"
"204987124-0-17066";"Why did Vaermina's nightmares steal your books?"
"204987124-0-17067";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-17068";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-17069";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-17071";"As you say, Bragur."
"204987124-0-17073";"You mentioned a puzzle. What's it like?"
"204987124-0-17074";"Sinmur? Like the giant?"
"204987124-0-17076";"I'll learn the song, Odana."
"204987124-0-17077";"How do you know we're touching Quagmire?"
"204987124-0-17078";"I'll check it out."
"204987124-0-17079";"I'll help the search."
"204987124-0-17080";"Sounds good to me."
"204987124-0-17081";"You're not a member of the Pact military, are you?"
"204987124-0-17085";"What clan attacks Shor's Stone?"
"204987124-0-17086";"You're not a member of the Pact military, are you?"
"204987124-0-17087";"Who are the Companions?"
"204987124-0-17093";"Burrowers? You mean the kwama opened up the Dwarven cave?"
"204987124-0-17094";"How will gathering their magicka help us?"
"204987124-0-17095";"Why was the ship so close to the shore?"
"204987124-0-17098";"Dwarven mines are said to contain great treasures …."
"204987124-0-17099";"What will that do?"
"204987124-0-17100";"I don't understand how this will work."
"204987124-0-17110";"I'm on it."
"204987124-0-17111";"Yes, it seems so."
"204987124-0-17113";"Do you know where the captain is now?"
"204987124-0-17115";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-17122";"I accept your offer."
"204987124-0-17124";"Thank you; I accept."
"204987124-0-17128";"Are you injured?"
"204987124-0-17129";"I don't think that's how you become undead."
"204987124-0-17136";"If you didn't see who hit you, how do you know it was a he?"
"204987124-0-17137";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-17145";"Why are the Fists of Thalmor in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-17150";"Why are the Fists of Thalmor in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-17151";"Still alive? What happened to your captain?"
"204987124-0-17152";"Why did you stop him?"
"204987124-0-17153";"Can a civilian militia retake Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-17154";"Do you think the lieutenant would do something foolhardy?"
"204987124-0-17159";"Who are you sending them against?"
"204987124-0-17161";"Your orders, ma'am?"
"204987124-0-17164";"Second courier? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-17166";"They took it through a portal."
"204987124-0-17167";"You want to put vampire blood in the King? Won't that turn him?"
"204987124-0-17168";"What can we use as a focus?"
"204987124-0-17169";"How do we know he survived?"
"204987124-0-17170";"What can bolster the King's life force?"
"204987124-0-17171";"What did you find?"
"204987124-0-17172";"What can boltster the King's life force?"
"204987124-0-17173";"Why didn't you stay with them?"
"204987124-0-17201";"I'll see if I can find him."
"204987124-0-17202";"What makes you think the mercenaries will turn against you?"
"204987124-0-17207";"Who are the Reachmen again?"
"204987124-0-17208";"So they don't care about the actual bodies?"
"204987124-0-17223";"Why are the Reachmen digging up corpses?"
"204987124-0-17224";"What are you doing with those effigies?"
"204987124-0-17225";"You don't have a high opinion of the captain?"
"204987124-0-17228";"I'm ready to go find the lieutenant."
"204987124-0-17229";"This isn't normal?"
"204987124-0-17231";"It looks like a ruin to me."
"204987124-0-17232";"Did Grida make a deal with you?"
"204987124-0-17235";"But now you want my help."
"204987124-0-17237";"What if your captain is dead?"
"204987124-0-17238";"So we slay the lamias, I take their cold, hard treasures, and you return this place to normal?"
"204987124-0-17239";"What should we do next?"
"204987124-0-17240";"Clear the road and blow the signal horn? I can do that."
"204987124-0-17241";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-17246";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-17248";"You're supposed to deliver mead to Windhelm."
"204987124-0-17252";"I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-17254";"Your party all died. How?"
"204987124-0-17255";"What happened to your shard of Wuuthrad?"
"204987124-0-17256";"Then I need to get inside."
"204987124-0-17257";"What's involved in opening the door?"
"204987124-0-17258";"I'll get the shard, and you're going to help me."
"204987124-0-17259";"And you don't know the combination?"
"204987124-0-17260";"Why would the planners leave behind keys to their puzzles?"
"204987124-0-17263";"Have you made mead before?"
"204987124-0-17265";"Will you change the name of the meadery?"
"204987124-0-17271";"And the forest responds to you?"
"204987124-0-17272";"I need your help."
"204987124-0-17273";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-17274";"What did it do?"
"204987124-0-17276";"He was shrugging off spells, then?"
"204987124-0-17277";"Maybe if I read it?"
"204987124-0-17278";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-17291";"I don't think the bath salts are safe."
"204987124-0-17293";"The Dreamwalker did? Is that why you're here?"
"204987124-0-17296";"You need to rest."
"204987124-0-17298";"What life do you speak of?"
"204987124-0-17299";"If you insist."
"204987124-0-17311";"Is there anything we can do?"
"204987124-0-17321";"What is daril?"
"204987124-0-17322";"Did Grida make a deal with you?"
"204987124-0-17324";"Will this cover it?"
"204987124-0-17325";"I'll seek out Thane Oda next."
"204987124-0-17326";"Asmalah lured the trolls here."
"204987124-0-17328";"What will your people do now?"
"204987124-0-17329";"Will this help you heal her?"
"204987124-0-17330";"King Jorunn has been poisoned. I need your help."
"204987124-0-17331";"With the Ternion monks."
"204987124-0-17334";"I need a vial of your blood. To save King Jorunn."
"204987124-0-17335";"Do you care what happened to Grida?"
"204987124-0-17336";"I don't think the bath salts are safe."
"204987124-0-17337";"All right. If you insist."
"204987124-0-17339";"I don't want to turn him into a vampire. I just need to bolster his life force."
"204987124-0-17341";"I'm ready if you are."
"204987124-0-17344";"King Jorunn was poisoned. I need your blood to save him."
"204987124-0-17345";"Can you grant me more power?"
"204987124-0-17346";"I'm trying to heal him."
"204987124-0-17349";"I can meet you at the docks."
"204987124-0-17350";"What will you do while I burn the supplies?"
"204987124-0-17352";"Why would invaders unload supplies in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-17353";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-17355";"Puzzle? What kind of puzzle?"
"204987124-0-17362";"The barrier was around his body."
"204987124-0-17367";"What did this leader look like?"
"204987124-0-17368";"The cult left him on the mountain?"
"204987124-0-17369";"So something attacked them on the mountain? Not the cats?"
"204987124-0-17370";"The Cultists didn't see you on their way down?"
"204987124-0-17371";"Something attacked them on the mountain? Not the cats?"
"204987124-0-17372";"Isn't the Green Lady one person?"
"204987124-0-17373";"What happens when the Green Lady dies?"
"204987124-0-17376";"Is the power from the memories?"
"204987124-0-17377";"We have a common enemy."
"204987124-0-17378";"Who took your team members?"
"204987124-0-17380";"I'll get them and meet you there."
"204987124-0-17381";"It will be done."
"204987124-0-17382";"What kind of power?"
"204987124-0-17383";"Who are the Ra Gada?"
"204987124-0-17384";"Do you really think your researchers are in there?"
"204987124-0-17388";"Some people are missing?"
"204987124-0-17390";"I'll go look for them."
"204987124-0-17391";"What gate are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-17392";"How can I destroy the gate?"
"204987124-0-17395";"What are thirsters?"
"204987124-0-17397";"Your sister asked me to help defeat the lamias."
"204987124-0-17398";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-17399";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-17406";"I'm glad I was here to help."
"204987124-0-17408";"I'll take a few of those exploding arrows."
"204987124-0-17410";"We?"
"204987124-0-17412";"Sounds simple enough. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-17414";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-17421";"And there's a spirit here?"
"204987124-0-17425";"What do you hope I can accomplish?"
"204987124-0-17426";"Do you know where I can find your daughters?"
"204987124-0-17433";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-17435";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-17436";"Why did that spirit threaten you?"
"204987124-0-17438";"The Worm Cult is here?"
"204987124-0-17439";"What is the less cruel option?"
"204987124-0-17444";"Why did you reach out to me?"
"204987124-0-17445";"Is there anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-17446";"Then let's get to it."
"204987124-0-17448";"Thank you. I'll try those."
"204987124-0-17450";"Sinrique could use it to free all of the spirits, then?"
"204987124-0-17453";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-17454";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-17455";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-17457";"How do I escape here?"
"204987124-0-17458";"What way would that be?"
"204987124-0-17461";"Her spirit said you killed her. She asked for my help."
"204987124-0-17462";"Why did you kill them?"
"204987124-0-17463";"She vanished when I brought them together."
"204987124-0-17465";"As you say, my Queen."
"204987124-0-17466";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-17467";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-17468";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-17469";"Why was the ship so close to the shore?"
"204987124-0-17470";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-17471";"Why was the ship so close to the shore?"
"204987124-0-17472";"Who should I look for?"
"204987124-0-17476";"What about Ilayas Ruins? What do you know about them?"
"204987124-0-17477";"The Green Hunters? Who are they?"
"204987124-0-17478";"Falinesti's been gone that long?"
"204987124-0-17479";"How did they capture you in the first place?"
"204987124-0-17480";"Who was behind your abduction?"
"204987124-0-17481";"Where were you headed when you were ambushed?"
"204987124-0-17482";"How did they capture you in the first place?"
"204987124-0-17484";"She didn't make it."
"204987124-0-17485";"I can try."
"204987124-0-17486";"Arithiel?"
"204987124-0-17488";"What is the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-17491";"Lyris Titanborn? I was told to find you."
"204987124-0-17498";"I only came searching for shards of Wuuthrad."
"204987124-0-17499";"We're all allies now. After the Akaviri war …."
"204987124-0-17501";"But why would the Jarls kill you now?"
"204987124-0-17503";"Why do you think the Jarls want to kill you?"
"204987124-0-17504";"I was there. The Worm Cult shattered it in a ritual to empower Sinmur after …."
"204987124-0-17508";"We're all allies now. After the Akaviri war …"
"204987124-0-17509";"The axe shattered on a mountainside. Pieces flew everywhere in the explosion."
"204987124-0-17510";"Hallfrida asked me to stay."
"204987124-0-17511";"You don't like her?"
"204987124-0-17512";"I'm still looking for shards of Wuuthrad."
"204987124-0-17514";"Are you ready to face him?"
"204987124-0-17515";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-17516";"What is the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-17517";"What is the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-17518";"Arithiel?"
"204987124-0-17519";"But she saved you?"
"204987124-0-17521";"Why'd they attack you?"
"204987124-0-17522";"And Arithiel saved you from them."
"204987124-0-17523";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-17525";"And how does Mauloch play into their plans?"
"204987124-0-17526";"How would Mauloch play into their plans?"
"204987124-0-17527";"I want to enter Obsidian Scar."
"204987124-0-17531";"I want to enter Fungal Grotto."
"204987124-0-17536";"How can I be sure you've truly repented?"
"204987124-0-17539";"There's got to be another way. Maybe any soul will do."
"204987124-0-17541";"I don't want to kill her."
"204987124-0-17544";"The imposters are burning the town. Where are your weapons?"
"204987124-0-17545";"Where is Arcwind Point?"
"204987124-0-17547";"What's the plan for the troops?"
"204987124-0-17554";"I also found the journal he kept. I know your secret."
"204987124-0-17556";"You've heard of what I did in Eastmarch?"
"204987124-0-17557";"You're sick. I'm putting an end to this madness!"
"204987124-0-17558";"And when Garil discovered the truth, you banished him."
"204987124-0-17574";"You're a liar and a cheat, Enthis."
"204987124-0-17576";"You're a liar and a cheat, Turil."
"204987124-0-17578";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-17579";"Who is Canonreeve Valano?"
"204987124-0-17580";"Who are the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-17581";"You're sure they're imposters?"

"204987124-0-17585";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-17586";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-17587";"What can you tell me about the attack?"
"204987124-0-17589";"Given you a second chance. Lead your people out of here."
"204987124-0-17591";"Life is never simple."
"204987124-0-17593";"I gave you a chance to put this madness behind you."
"204987124-0-17595";"About what?"
"204987124-0-17596";"Cinnamon perfume?"
"204987124-0-17597";"Follow me."
"204987124-0-17601";"<End Jiluza's life.>"
"204987124-0-17602";"<End Bolion's life.>"
"204987124-0-17603";"<End Elenya's life.>"
"204987124-0-17604";"<End Eryon's life.>"
"204987124-0-17631";"I'll deal with Uricantar."
"204987124-0-17633";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-17634";"Is that the artifact you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-17637";"What gate are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-17638";"Why would Teldur conspire to destroy his own town?"
"204987124-0-17639";"How can I get into the manor?"
"204987124-0-17640";"Why would Teldur conspire to destroy his own town?"
"204987124-0-17652";"Do you know where you'll go?"
"204987124-0-17655";"Where can I find fire salts?"
"204987124-0-17656";"<Slap her> Snap out of it! What happened?"
"204987124-0-17658";"Can I find any more in town?"
"204987124-0-17660";"What's the tea called?"
"204987124-0-17661";"Just take your gold."
"204987124-0-17663";"Who took him, Yiri? Who took your pa?"
"204987124-0-17669";"Where should I look?"
"204987124-0-17670";"I'll see what I can find out."
"204987124-0-17672";"After I find them, then what?"
"204987124-0-17673";"After I find them, then what?"
"204987124-0-17675";"I'll find your friends and meet you there."
"204987124-0-17676";"You said this rite was dangerous. Perhaps I can help."
"204987124-0-17677";"I haven't found Dadazi yet."
"204987124-0-17678";"But what?"
"204987124-0-17679";"Can you make it to the camp on your own?"
"204987124-0-17680";"Can you make it to the camp on your own?"
"204987124-0-17682";"Let me find the rest of the minstrels, then I'll see about finding the instruments."
"204987124-0-17683";"I haven't found Buzul yet, but I'll keep looking."
"204987124-0-17685";"How about you? Can you make the camp?"
"204987124-0-17686";"What?"
"204987124-0-17687";"In the meantime, can you find the camp?"
"204987124-0-17688";"I want to find the other minstrels first."
"204987124-0-17690";"Laen sent me to find you. She wants to rendezvous at your camp."
"204987124-0-17693";"I'm a friend of the Silvenar, and I'm trying to help you."
"204987124-0-17694";"Why did you think she betrayed you?"
"204987124-0-17695";"You need to get to your old camp. Can you do that?"
"204987124-0-17697";"Let's see if I can find the other minstrels first."
"204987124-0-17699";"Can we put the axe back together?"
"204987124-0-17700";"And what's a Reachmage?"
"204987124-0-17701";"Why would they think you'd betrayed them?"
"204987124-0-17702";"Do you know why the Houndsmen attacked you?"
"204987124-0-17703";"If you play now, do you think he'd attack again?"
"204987124-0-17705";"Not just yet. I have to prepare."
"204987124-0-17706";"Yes, I'm ready. Start playing."
"204987124-0-17712";"You rallied all these people here?"
"204987124-0-17713";"How are they using it?"
"204987124-0-17716";"After you, my Queen."
"204987124-0-17725";"I'm not here to hurt you. Tell me what's bothering you."
"204987124-0-17726";"Why go to Trolhetta?"
"204987124-0-17733";"I killed him."
"204987124-0-17734";"The Silvenar's safe. He just needs <<Ac:1>> to begin the wedding."
"204987124-0-17735";"The Silvenar's safe. He just needs <<Ac:1>> to begin the wedding."
"204987124-0-17737";"Thank you. I'll take it to them right away."
"204987124-0-17759";"I'll gather more kindling. Hang on."
"204987124-0-17761";"I'll be right back."
"204987124-0-17762";"What for?"
"204987124-0-17763";"And they'll just hand over their gold?"
"204987124-0-17764";"I'll talk to the Khajiit."
"204987124-0-17765";"I'll take whatever you can give."
"204987124-0-17767";"He needs everyone's support."
"204987124-0-17769";"I'll be sure to remind him."
"204987124-0-17771";"Rest now. I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-17775";"Where are they now?"
"204987124-0-17777";"Can I speak with him?"
"204987124-0-17789";"After I find them, then what?"
"204987124-0-17801";"I'm only interested in the shards."
"204987124-0-17803";"Where are these mercenaries, then?"
"204987124-0-17805";"I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-17807";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-17812";"Arithiel?"
"204987124-0-17814";"Children can be cruel."
"204987124-0-17817";"I think I get the idea, Murmurs."
"204987124-0-17818";"What is she doing out here?"
"204987124-0-17819";"What was that word? Incanbull?"
"204987124-0-17820";"What is she doing out there?"
"204987124-0-17821";"The spirits have been here ever since?"
"204987124-0-17825";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-17826";"Who is Andewen?"
"204987124-0-17838";"I don't plan to die."
"204987124-0-17840";"Hand over the Mallari-Mora or I'll have to take it."
"204987124-0-17841";"So the spirits weren't here when you arrived?"
"204987124-0-17842";"The end?"
"204987124-0-17843";"Does Telenger's word really hold that much sway in the Guild?"
"204987124-0-17844";"Accident prone?"
"204987124-0-17845";"You think the others lied to get here?"
"204987124-0-17848";"What is the Mallari-Mora?"
"204987124-0-17849";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-17852";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-17856";"Sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-17857";"Then I'll destroy the heartwood for you."
"204987124-0-17858";"And once I've collected the components?"
"204987124-0-17859";"And once I've collected the components?"
"204987124-0-17860";"Look, do you want me to help or not?"
"204987124-0-17861";"What do I do?"
"204987124-0-17863";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-17865";"You're not trapped the way the other spirits are, then?"
"204987124-0-17866";"You tried to stop him. Why are you ashamed?"
"204987124-0-17868";"What are you interested in?"
"204987124-0-17871";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-17873";"What would be most entertaining for you, then?"
"204987124-0-17877";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-17878";"What kind of entertainment are you looking for?"
"204987124-0-17882";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-17884";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-17886";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-17888";"You will drink this, even if I have to pour it down your throat."
"204987124-0-17896";"How do we lower the wards?"
"204987124-0-17897";"Good luck, Battlereeve."
"204987124-0-17899";"What do I do?"
"204987124-0-17901";"Can anyone undertake the trials?"
"204987124-0-17905";"Here in the hall? So, you won't be coming with me?"
"204987124-0-17910";"What then?"
"204987124-0-17911";"Into the breach!"
"204987124-0-17912";"Sinmur did that?"
"204987124-0-17916";"What happened at Fort Greenwall?"
"204987124-0-17919";"You mentioned fires?"
"204987124-0-17920";"What happened at Fort Greenwall?"
"204987124-0-17921";"Sinmur collapsed the pass?"
"204987124-0-17922";"What happened at Fort Greenwall?"
"204987124-0-17923";"What happened at Fort Greenwall?"
"204987124-0-17924";"You mentioned fires?"
"204987124-0-17925";"Prepare to feel pain, spy!"
"204987124-0-17926";"Too bad. Let's get this over with."
"204987124-0-17927";"What will you do while I burn the supplies?"
"204987124-0-17932";"Will you come with me, Raz?"
"204987124-0-17934";"A guardian? That would be helpful."
"204987124-0-17936";"It wasn't your fault."
"204987124-0-17941";"I will."
"204987124-0-17943";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-17947";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-17948";"I'll get it done."
"204987124-0-17953";"I'll free you."
"204987124-0-17955";"What are the Pellingares doing down here?"
"204987124-0-17956";"I'll find the Pellingares and defeat them."
"204987124-0-17959";"I'm with you. What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-17960";"What's wrong with the palace?"
"204987124-0-17963";"Business?"
"204987124-0-17966";"I never said anything about being a spy."
"204987124-0-17974";"You don't believe the tales?"
"204987124-0-17976";"Where's Thulvald's logging camp?"
"204987124-0-17978";"What do the cultists want down there?"
"204987124-0-17979";"What will freeing the mammoths do?"
"204987124-0-17980";"How do I open the gates?"
"204987124-0-17981";"Farandor asked me to give you this."
"204987124-0-17983";"What will freeing the mammoths do?"
"204987124-0-17986";"Who are the spinners?"
"204987124-0-17988";"Why aren't there more shrines to Z'en?"
"204987124-0-17989";"How did this conflict start?"
"204987124-0-17990";"What if I refuse?"
"204987124-0-17991";"And what are the rules of the arena?"
"204987124-0-17992";"How can I defeat so many foes?"
"204987124-0-17993";"Will you go in there with me?"
"204987124-0-17995";"As you say."
"204987124-0-17999";"Some people were wandering the fields. They looked diseased and attacked me."
"204987124-0-18000";"I'm fine. How long has this plague been going on?"
"204987124-0-18005";"You're rather cryptic."
"204987124-0-18006";"Why don't you just leave?"
"204987124-0-18007";"You're rather cryptic."
"204987124-0-18008";"You must have some ideas."
"204987124-0-18010";"Why would that cause trouble for Bar-Neeus?"
"204987124-0-18011";"Perhaps if I came back after hours?"
"204987124-0-18012";"I must warn you. Sarisa Rothalen asked me to plant illegal goods in your stall."
"204987124-0-18015";"Do you know what they're trying to do here?"
"204987124-0-18016";"The wolves attacked me."
"204987124-0-18018";"He's a Worm Cultist."
"204987124-0-18019";"What about Sarisa?"
"204987124-0-18021";"Mind if I look at the body?"
"204987124-0-18022";"What happened to your team?"
"204987124-0-18024";"You weren't prepared for an attack?"
"204987124-0-18025";"I have another question."
"204987124-0-18026";"So, what happened?"
"204987124-0-18027";"You seem to know a lot about the Maormer."
"204987124-0-18028";"Your captain really seems to inspire loyalty."
"204987124-0-18030";"Why aren't you a sailor?"
"204987124-0-18032";"You think there are spies among your ranks?"
"204987124-0-18033";"Any theories?"
"204987124-0-18035";"What happened to your troop?"
"204987124-0-18036";"Anything I should know before I start?"
"204987124-0-18037";"How did you avoid capture?"
"204987124-0-18039";"I saw flasks of Altmer golden pear ale in his supply chest."
"204987124-0-18040";"I need to get you some help."
"204987124-0-18043";"Why don't you strike first, then?"
"204987124-0-18044";"I am. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-18049";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-18051";"Teldur?"
"204987124-0-18053";"I'm sorry. What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-18054";"Yngvar, you're a soldier! Act like one. What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-18055";"From lycanthropy?"
"204987124-0-18056";"And he's following them, for the confrontation ritual before his marriage."
"204987124-0-18058";"So it seems. What happened after he contracted lycanthropy?"
"204987124-0-18059";"How can I free you? And the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-18061";"I'll find him, and see what I can do."
"204987124-0-18062";"What brings you to Shor's Stone?"
"204987124-0-18063";"How did you get this assignment?"
"204987124-0-18064";"What brought you here, then?"
"204987124-0-18065";"Breakdown?"
"204987124-0-18066";"You're looking well now."
"204987124-0-18067";"What brought you to Nimalten?"
"204987124-0-18068";"How did you get this assignment?"
"204987124-0-18072";"What brings you to Nimalten?"
"204987124-0-18074";"Did you suspect anything before the attack?"
"204987124-0-18076";"How goes the investigation?"
"204987124-0-18078";"Right. Thanks, Golun."
"204987124-0-18083";"And outside your guild hall?"
"204987124-0-18092";"What savage beasts?"
"204987124-0-18093";"Who is Raen?"
"204987124-0-18094";"Who is Sariel?"
"204987124-0-18095";"Who is Sariel?"
"204987124-0-18096";"How were you taken?"
"204987124-0-18097";"How were you taken?"
"204987124-0-18100";"Are you really Skald Skullsplitter?"
"204987124-0-18101";"How do you treat something like this?"
"204987124-0-18102";"Happy to help."
"204987124-0-18103";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-18104";"Where's the courier?"
"204987124-0-18105";"Where's the courier?"
"204987124-0-18106";"That's why I'm here. The Mages Guild wants one of your books."
"204987124-0-18107";"That's why I'm here. The Mages Guild wants one of your books."
"204987124-0-18110";"Where's the courier?"
"204987124-0-18111";"Hendil? What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-18112";"Who should I talk to?"
"204987124-0-18113";"Is there anything else I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-18118";"Oh, that's really not necessary!"
"204987124-0-18119";"Here's the aloe."
"204987124-0-18121";"Right. Hope you feel—"
"204987124-0-18122";"I don't know. You were on his list."
"204987124-0-18124";"The Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-18126";"You mentioned your mother?"
"204987124-0-18128";"Do you know what Urcelmo is planning?"
"204987124-0-18129";"What's the last memory you have?"
"204987124-0-18130";"That's it?"
"204987124-0-18136";"How did Estre do this?"
"204987124-0-18138";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-18139";"We need to get you out of here. Take this teleportation scroll."
"204987124-0-18140";"Fine. What's the Oath?"
"204987124-0-18141";"Go on."
"204987124-0-18142";"Lord Geirmund was a crazy mage."
"204987124-0-18152";"Focus?"
"204987124-0-18161";"I've fought worse than you, and survived."
"204987124-0-18163";"Tell me about Vikonn."
"204987124-0-18164";"Tell me about her."
"204987124-0-18165";"Do you want to talk about it?"
"204987124-0-18168";"You're in for an unpleasant surprise, then."
"204987124-0-18169";"You're in for an unpleasant surprise, then."
"204987124-0-18170";"I'll do my best, Sinien."
"204987124-0-18171";"What should I use to build the fire?"
"204987124-0-18172";"Why do I need a furry friend, again?"
"204987124-0-18173";"Which side does the memorial commemorate?"
"204987124-0-18174";"Where did your Grandfather get a blade like that?"
"204987124-0-18175";"Do you believe him?"
"204987124-0-18176";"What's this memorial you spoke of?"
"204987124-0-18178";"Right behind you."
"204987124-0-18186";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-18188";"He shaved the rats, slept in a cage."
"204987124-0-18189";"He chewed upon the Goblin tree."
"204987124-0-18194";"I have a teleportation scroll here. Take it, and get yourself warmed up."
"204987124-0-18198";"Saved the Rift in Harald's age."
"204987124-0-18199";"Hey samaramalrumulrage."
"204987124-0-18200";"He chewed upon the Goblin tree."
"204987124-0-18201";"He chewed upon the Goblin tree."
"204987124-0-18208";"As you say, sir."
"204987124-0-18212";"And sat a feather on a flea."
"204987124-0-18213";"And sat a feather on a flea."
"204987124-0-18214";"And sat a feather on a flea."
"204987124-0-18215";"A thumb was burnt into a cake."
"204987124-0-18216";"A thumb was burnt into a cake."
"204987124-0-18217";"A thumb was burnt into a cake."
"204987124-0-18218";"And in his name this oath I take."
"204987124-0-18219";"And in his name this oath I take."
"204987124-0-18220";"And in his name this oath I take."
"204987124-0-18221";"Should evil come, should night descend,"
"204987124-0-18222";"Should evil come, should night descend,"
"204987124-0-18223";"Should evil come, should night descend,"
"204987124-0-18224";"I'm going to be sick."
"204987124-0-18227";"I'm going to be sick."
"204987124-0-18231";"Done! I'm off."
"204987124-0-18233";"Here. I'll be quick."
"204987124-0-18234";"Expensive, eh? Would be a shame if you weren't paid back."
"204987124-0-18237";"Strange mushrooms?"
"204987124-0-18238";"Right. We need to get you out of here. Take this teleportation scroll."
"204987124-0-18241";"How does it go?"
"204987124-0-18242";"How does it go?"
"204987124-0-18243";"How does it go?"
"204987124-0-18244";"Uh … sure. Do you have a second book I could take to her?"
"204987124-0-18246";"I'll go first and place the stones. Stay safe."
"204987124-0-18251";"Traitor? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-18252";"Concentrate. Where did the mage go? Where are the other members of the Queen's entourage?"
"204987124-0-18253";"You know, I do have this very valuable scroll. Why don't you read it over?"
"204987124-0-18255";"What of the shard?"
"204987124-0-18258";"Why would he create a plague?"
"204987124-0-18259";"I need to get into the mine, then."
"204987124-0-18260";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-18262";"What's wrong with all of these people?"
"204987124-0-18264";"This is just wrong."
"204987124-0-18265";"You need to answer for what you've done here."
"204987124-0-18266";"How do I know you won't run?"
"204987124-0-18271";"I found him just inside the entrance. I don't think the vampire got to him."
"204987124-0-18272";"I'm sorry, Velatosse. I was too late."
"204987124-0-18283";"Who's Queen Nurnhilde?"
"204987124-0-18290";"Are you loyal to the Thane, or Thorulf?"
"204987124-0-18291";"I need to get into Thorulf's room. Can you help?"
"204987124-0-18293";"This should cover it."
"204987124-0-18294";"This should cover it."
"204987124-0-18296";"She was doing fine when I saw her. Got a promotion and everything."
"204987124-0-18297";"Who did he hire?"
"204987124-0-18298";"Celebration?"
"204987124-0-18300";"What does a thane do?"
"204987124-0-18302";"You mentioned a palace."
"204987124-0-18303";"Isn't it dangerous to admit you belong to a Daedric cult?"
"204987124-0-18305";"Why did you turn the people into statues, though?"
"204987124-0-18306";"Never?"
"204987124-0-18309";"What are these monoliths you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-18314";"Against Sinmur?"
"204987124-0-18315";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-18316";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-18317";"<<1>> would be a good fit."
"204987124-0-18322";"It hasn't gone very well."
"204987124-0-18323";"How can Daedra ever save lives?"
"204987124-0-18326";"[Merormo Dies] It was all his fault. He summoned Daedra to influence the beasts."
"204987124-0-18328";"How did the Mabrigash find this place?"
"204987124-0-18329";"Have you ever wanted to leave the Vale?"
"204987124-0-18330";"How did the Mabrigash find this place?"
"204987124-0-18337";"Where's Amitra?"
"204987124-0-18339";"The elk's antlers?"
"204987124-0-18341";"Did I offend you in some way?"
"204987124-0-18342";"Lucky for you, I'm not looking for your sister."
"204987124-0-18346";"Have you ever killed a snake?"
"204987124-0-18348";"Have you interrogated prisoners?"
"204987124-0-18349";"What's the cruel option?"
"204987124-0-18369";"Let me free them. Let me participate in your tests."
"204987124-0-18371";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-18372";"What's the handfasting?"
"204987124-0-18373";"What's the handfasting?"
"204987124-0-18374";"Where's Vulkwasten?"
"204987124-0-18375";"Piracy and corruption? Sounds interesting."
"204987124-0-18376";"Piracy and corruption? Sounds interesting."
"204987124-0-18377";"Where's Bloodgutter?"
"204987124-0-18378";"That's horrible."
"204987124-0-18379";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-18380";"You mentioned treasure?"
"204987124-0-18381";"How much do you weigh?"
"204987124-0-18382";"I know a butcher who pays pretty well per pound."
"204987124-0-18386";"How much do you weigh?"
"204987124-0-18387";"What do you know about Deepwoods?"
"204987124-0-18388";"What about Ilayas Ruins? What do you know about them?"
"204987124-0-18391";"Who are the Green Hunters?"
"204987124-0-18392";"What's <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-18394";"What can you tell me about Castle Rilis?"
"204987124-0-18396";"What does he think of Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-18398";"What does he think of High Kinlady Estre?"
"204987124-0-18399";"Do you support the Queen?"
"204987124-0-18401";"Greater issues?"
"204987124-0-18402";"Is everyone against Daedra worship?"
"204987124-0-18404";"What is his realm?"
"204987124-0-18406";"You believe you're superior?"
"204987124-0-18408";"What if Estre won?"
"204987124-0-18410";"Sinien mentioned you were injured?"
"204987124-0-18415";"Do you already have the treasure?"
"204987124-0-18418";"With all this talk of war, is this really a good time for a party?"
"204987124-0-18420";"You look like a cinch to win the wrestling contest."
"204987124-0-18421";"Your other choices would have been buried meat or a box of flagons."
"204987124-0-18423";"Have a safe journey."
"204987124-0-18425";"You're headed to Anvil anyway, right? I'm sure the captain's contacts could prove useful."
"204987124-0-18426";"He refused to accept your offer. I guess you're stranded here."
"204987124-0-18429";"Take the note."
"204987124-0-18431";"I'll get past them, Velatosse."
"204987124-0-18435";"I left him tied up inside the mine. I was going to get the mercenary captain to—"
"204987124-0-18440";"Care to join me?"
"204987124-0-18441";"Have they told you how long they're going to keep them down there?"
"204987124-0-18443";"I hope she gets better soon."
"204987124-0-18444";"Where do you meet?"
"204987124-0-18445";"Is it possible your mother was using skooma?"
"204987124-0-18446";"I will."
"204987124-0-18448";"Who are the faithful?"
"204987124-0-18450";"Who are the faithful?"
"204987124-0-18451";"What is the Summer Site?"
"204987124-0-18453";"Falinesti's been gone for generations?"
"204987124-0-18454";"Falinesti's been gone that long?"
"204987124-0-18455";"Where are your goods?"
"204987124-0-18456";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-18458";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-18459";"Do you really believe Falinesti's just going to appear here?"
"204987124-0-18460";"Do you really believe Falinesti's just going to appear here?"
"204987124-0-18465";"What do you think she should do?"
"204987124-0-18475";"I could escort you there."
"204987124-0-18479";"On my way."
"204987124-0-18481";"I don't understand. That junk is your treasure?"
"204987124-0-18482";"You buried meat?"
"204987124-0-18484";"<<1>> won't be happy."
"204987124-0-18485";"In this little cave?"
"204987124-0-18487";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-18488";"Quickly? Why?"
"204987124-0-18489";"You said ""first?"""
"204987124-0-18492";"Yes, let's get started."
"204987124-0-18493";"I'll speak to the advisor first."
"204987124-0-18494";"No! I'm not ready. Give me a moment."
"204987124-0-18497";"I'll go right away."
"204987124-0-18499";"I know you want to find your husband, but I was told to get you to the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-18500";"Aren't you an officer?"
"204987124-0-18501";"Please, do more research. You can't reach Falinesti this way."
"204987124-0-18504";"Farandare, you'll die if you go through the portal."
"204987124-0-18505";"Good luck with your research, Farandare."
"204987124-0-18508";"I will."
"204987124-0-18509";"I will."
"204987124-0-18515";"Why would a burglar steal those?"
"204987124-0-18517";"I'll check it out."
"204987124-0-18520";"What about Raerana?"
"204987124-0-18521";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-18528";"You seem a bit upset. What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-18530";"I'll take a look for you."
"204987124-0-18531";"You're not concerned about the dead burglar?"
"204987124-0-18532";"I was attacked by a man in some kind of uniform."
"204987124-0-18534";"I'm to help a Steward Eminwe. Do you know where she is?"
"204987124-0-18536";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-18539";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-18542";"Got it."
"204987124-0-18543";"The what?"
"204987124-0-18545";"Do you have any evidence?"
"204987124-0-18549";"What do you—"
"204987124-0-18550";"You're not concerned about the dead burglar?"
"204987124-0-18553";"I was attacked by a man in some kind of uniform."
"204987124-0-18557";"I suppose I should report to her now."
"204987124-0-18561";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-18564";"I've heard you offer goods not officially available in Riften."
"204987124-0-18565";"I've heard you offer goods not officially available in Riften."
"204987124-0-18569";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-18571";"You going to let me out of here?"
"204987124-0-18573";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-18596";"There's a plot to kill the Queen, battlereeve."
"204987124-0-18598";"The captain is the one behind this. She plans to attack the Queen in the temple."
"204987124-0-18602";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-18604";"Yes, my Queen. She said you had betrayed us."
"204987124-0-18609";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-18610";"I will. I accept your offer, my Queen."
"204987124-0-18614";"Fine. Here's your coin."
"204987124-0-18616";"Right, right. Here."
"204987124-0-18618";"Just take them."
"204987124-0-18620";"What do you think the Worm Cult is up to?"
"204987124-0-18621";"You mentioned a puzzle. What's it like?"
"204987124-0-18623";"I recovered these notes from the Worm Cult."
"204987124-0-18625";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-18627";"No one can help?"
"204987124-0-18634";"Can I talk to your father?"
"204987124-0-18635";"So you won't fight the pirates?"
"204987124-0-18641";"Why did you decide to defect?"
"204987124-0-18642";"What exactly is a Saxhleel?"
"204987124-0-18643";"Still, seems like a big decision to defect."
"204987124-0-18644";"Did any of them try to stop you?"
"204987124-0-18645";"Do you miss your command?"
"204987124-0-18646";"Your husband did?"
"204987124-0-18647";"I have proof you're part of the Veiled Heritance. You're under arrest, Malanie. Come quietly and—"
"204987124-0-18648";"Why did you decide to defect?"
"204987124-0-18649";"Why did you decide to defect?"
"204987124-0-18651";"No trouble. Just an old friend I haven't seen in awhile."
"204987124-0-18652";"How'd you get down here, anyway?"
"204987124-0-18662";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-18669";"Who is Helushk?"
"204987124-0-18670";"Who is Helushk?"
"204987124-0-18671";"Daedric shrine? That cave has a shrine inside?"
"204987124-0-18672";"What are Helusk's soldiers practicing?"
"204987124-0-18675";"What are Helusk's soldiers practicing?"
"204987124-0-18676";"Why do you think they're insane?"
"204987124-0-18677";"What if the next round's on me? That help jog your memory?"
"204987124-0-18678";"Why? She seemed pretty upset."
"204987124-0-18679";"If that's your decision, I'll tell the captain."
"204987124-0-18680";"No, Captain Erronfaire. The Wave Cutter. Your ship?"
"204987124-0-18683";"Where can I find Degail?"
"204987124-0-18684";"Why? What happened?"
"204987124-0-18686";"Do you know where I can find Degail?"
"204987124-0-18688";"Don't you get tired of undeath?"
"204987124-0-18689";"Who are you going to fight?"
"204987124-0-18690";"Don't you get tired of undeath?"
"204987124-0-18691";"I'm on it."
"204987124-0-18692";"The Worm Cult."
"204987124-0-18699";"It'll be easier on us both if you just pay her."
"204987124-0-18701";"Right. Get out of here."
"204987124-0-18733";"Hold on there—"
"204987124-0-18735";"How should I do that?"
"204987124-0-18737";"I'll start."
"204987124-0-18738";"Good idea, I'll see what she thinks."
"204987124-0-18741";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-18744";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-18749";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-18751";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-18753";"What happened to Degail?"
"204987124-0-18756";"I'll let her know."
"204987124-0-18757";"I won't touch a thing."
"204987124-0-18759";"Fine, fine. I'll tell the captain."
"204987124-0-18762";"I'll get into the house and meet you when I have something."
"204987124-0-18763";"Let me untie you, and we'll both get out of here."
"204987124-0-18766";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-18768";"I'll report you to—"
"204987124-0-18770";"What now?"
"204987124-0-18771";"I'll see what she has to say."
"204987124-0-18774";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-18775";"Thanks for the tip."
"204987124-0-18778";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-18779";"Uh….hmmmm…ok"
"204987124-0-18785";"Uh, ok, so what do you know about her then?"
"204987124-0-18787";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-18788";"I'll pass out the aloe, then."
"204987124-0-18789";"Go on."
"204987124-0-18791";"So you want me to steal the blades?"
"204987124-0-18792";"How do I use <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-18795";"Thanks!"
"204987124-0-18796";"On my way."
"204987124-0-18800";"I'll head to the lodge now."
"204987124-0-18815";"I will!"
"204987124-0-18816";"It seems Sinmur has returned."
"204987124-0-18817";"Why is Wuuthrad so powerful?"
"204987124-0-18818";"So even its shards have power?"
"204987124-0-18819";"Can you tell me about your battle with Sinmur?"
"204987124-0-18834";"I can help rescue the captives."
"204987124-0-18843";"Yes, he's dead."
"204987124-0-18844";"Anyone could kill a rat."
"204987124-0-18847";"I'll deal with Greatclaw."
"204987124-0-18848";"No, just a normal bird. It flew away."
"204987124-0-18849";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-18852";"Yeah, yeah. I'll go kill the little guy for you."
"204987124-0-18853";"No, I found a giant. I killed him."
"204987124-0-18855";"That's the one."
"204987124-0-18857";"Should I go after her?"
"204987124-0-18858";"How can I stop them?"
"204987124-0-18860";"What's she up to?"
"204987124-0-18861";"I think I killed one of her giants."
"204987124-0-18863";"I smelled a rat, but maybe not soon enough."
"204987124-0-18864";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-18865";"I'll find her. Don't worry."
"204987124-0-18872";"I'm sorry about Sage Tirora, Vigrod."
"204987124-0-18875";"I'll see you soon, Vigrod."
"204987124-0-18876";"Where did he find you?"
"204987124-0-18877";"Indulge me. Who's Ysgramor?"
"204987124-0-18879";"Sounds useful."
"204987124-0-18880";"Good to know."
"204987124-0-18882";"Right, yes, that makes sense."
"204987124-0-18883";"What are <<1>> used for?"
"204987124-0-18885";"What's he done?"
"204987124-0-18887";"Do you want this evidence I found?"
"204987124-0-18888";"I'm not with the guards. I just want to talk."
"204987124-0-18889";"Do you really want to die? I'm your only choice here."
"204987124-0-18891";"I'm coming in."
"204987124-0-18892";"What brought them to Darkshade Caverns?"
"204987124-0-18893";"Where are the regular mine workers?"
"204987124-0-18894";"Who leads the Reachmen against us?"
"204987124-0-18895";"Is that true?"
"204987124-0-18896";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-18897";"Who leads the Reachmen against us?"
"204987124-0-18898";"Go ahead, threaten me again."
"204987124-0-18904";"I found a body I think he knows something about."
"204987124-0-18907";"<Continue reading.>"
"204987124-0-18910";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-18911";"Where's Amitra?"
"204987124-0-18912";"What about Theofa?"
"204987124-0-18913";"Is there something I can do to help with the preparations?"
"204987124-0-18916";"I will."
"204987124-0-18917";"I will."
"204987124-0-18918";"I'll speak to the advisor first."
"204987124-0-18919";"I'm at the Queen's service."
"204987124-0-18920";"Where was she?"
"204987124-0-18921";"What's the Queen's speech about?"
"204987124-0-18922";"Who are the First Auridon Marines?"
"204987124-0-18923";"Who are the First Auridon Marines?"
"204987124-0-18924";"You're not a marine?"
"204987124-0-18925";"Can you tell me more about Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-18926";"Any idea what that means?"
"204987124-0-18927";"Where should I begin?"
"204987124-0-18928";"I can handle it. But why didn't you send your guards in?"
"204987124-0-18929";"Do you know what the spirit wants?"
"204987124-0-18937";"I need you to make friends with <<1>> for a few minutes."
"204987124-0-18939";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-18940";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-18944";"Who is Z'en?"
"204987124-0-18947";"I imagine that attracted some attention?"
"204987124-0-18955";"<Continue reading.>"
"204987124-0-18957";"What was that word? Incanbull?"
"204987124-0-18958";"Let's get inside."
"204987124-0-18959";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-18960";"Uricantar. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-18961";"He also spoke of a shard of Aetherius."
"204987124-0-18962";"What did he do?"
"204987124-0-18963";"Uricantar. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-18964";"Meldil mentioned a place called Aetherius. What is that?"
"204987124-0-18965";"Why did you reach out to me?"
"204987124-0-18966";"I'm here to help. You must have some idea which tiles to activate."
"204987124-0-18968";"What do you think of the Queen's goals here?"
"204987124-0-18970";"I found this note on her body. I don't understand what it means."
"204987124-0-18972";"What do you make of it?"
"204987124-0-18973";"You're no fighter. Just hand over the gold."
"204987124-0-18978";"Just get out of here."
"204987124-0-18982";"Hold on there—"
"204987124-0-18984";"You don't want to mess with me."
"204987124-0-18985";"You know, it's better to pay and just be done with it."
"204987124-0-18993";"Get out of here."
"204987124-0-18994";"If that's the way you want it—"
"204987124-0-19003";"Get out of here."
"204987124-0-19004";"Wait! I don't want to—"
"204987124-0-19006";"What I need is a souvenir of the First Auridon Marines."
"204987124-0-19010";"Yes, I know what it entails."
"204987124-0-19011";"<<1>> was very worried about you."
"204987124-0-19017";"So you work for the Queen?"
"204987124-0-19018";"The most-trusted agents? What about the First Auridon Marines?"
"204987124-0-19019";"Can you tell me anything else about the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-19020";"We should go find her."
"204987124-0-19022";"Will the bite change you?"
"204987124-0-19031";"But the village itself was saved."
"204987124-0-19032";"What do you need to do?"
"204987124-0-19034";"A bargaining chip?"
"204987124-0-19035";"You're in league with the Heritance and the Pact?"
"204987124-0-19036";"Your father gave me this invisibility elixir. He wants you to make your way—"
"204987124-0-19038";"You said the ruins to the north, right? I'll go find him while you get out of here."
"204987124-0-19039";"How long does the possession last?"
"204987124-0-19043";"You committed treason. And now you want me to help you clean up your mess?"
"204987124-0-19045";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-19047";"Actually, he is here. He sent me in here with the plan to save Palith."
"204987124-0-19054";"Who do I speak to?"
"204987124-0-19057";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-19059";"What have you done to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-19061";"In his defense, he didn't want to just leave. He—"
"204987124-0-19062";"What fate? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-19064";"He should be right behind me."
"204987124-0-19067";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-19068";"Yes. Two-Blades waits for you at the entrance."
"204987124-0-19069";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-19074";"Two-Blades sent me. What do you mean they were ""preparing to turn you?"""
"204987124-0-19083";"Did you learn anything that could help us stop them?"
"204987124-0-19084";"What do you mean, you don't deserve the title?"
"204987124-0-19086";"Why is this place named Geirmund's Hall?"
"204987124-0-19087";"What did you mean, you don't deserve the title?"
"204987124-0-19088";"Why is this place named Geirmund's Hall?"
"204987124-0-19089";"And the only possible sentence is death?"
"204987124-0-19093";"Forget duty. He's your son. [Eranamo lives]"
"204987124-0-19099";"Two-Blades sent me. What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-19100";"Do you know how we can stop them?"
"204987124-0-19101";"But everyone's dead."
"204987124-0-19104";"What's a Sload?"
"204987124-0-19106";"You mentioned High Kinlady Estre?"
"204987124-0-19109";"Then why aren't you drinking?"
"204987124-0-19110";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-19112";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-19113";"I will protect you."
"204987124-0-19118";"Thanks. I guess."
"204987124-0-19119";"Thanks. I guess."
"204987124-0-19120";"For the Queen."
"204987124-0-19121";"I learned some awful things about your family."
"204987124-0-19122";"You mentioned pay for services rendered?"
"204987124-0-19124";"What's the ceremony about?"
"204987124-0-19125";"I've heard reports of mistreatment here at the college."
"204987124-0-19126";"I'll get it done, Raz."
"204987124-0-19127";"I'll get it done, Raz."
"204987124-0-19128";"Of course."
"204987124-0-19135";"Trust me. I'm under cover, working with agents of the Queen."
"204987124-0-19145";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-19146";"I'm here to join the cause."
"204987124-0-19147";"Yes."
"204987124-0-19148";"You were on an important mission?"
"204987124-0-19149";"It's true. Gorak was amazing. The cultists ran in fear before him."
"204987124-0-19154";"Bottoms up."
"204987124-0-19156";"Why would the Canonreeve come here?"
"204987124-0-19157";"But what happened to Athel?"
"204987124-0-19158";"Why didn't the curse affect me?"
"204987124-0-19160";"What happened to Claudie's child?"
"204987124-0-19162";"Why help Claudie? The Dremora are evil."
"204987124-0-19163";"Why can't you warn the Queen?"
"204987124-0-19164";"That makes sense."
"204987124-0-19168";"What enemy did you face?"
"204987124-0-19170";"What is the Spider Cult?"
"204987124-0-19171";"How can we stop them?"
"204987124-0-19182";"We? All right. Hold still."
"204987124-0-19183";"Are there a lot of Orcs in the Lion Guard?"
"204987124-0-19186";"Hold still."
"204987124-0-19188";"Why were you out here?"
"204987124-0-19189";"It'll be just a moment."
"204987124-0-19190";"Don't move."
"204987124-0-19191";"Are there a lot of Orcs in the Lion Guard?"
"204987124-0-19192";"I haven't heard of many Orcs in the Lion Guard."
"204987124-0-19193";"You seem pretty intent on making it in the Lion Guard."
"204987124-0-19194";"Why not get rid of him?"
"204987124-0-19195";"I'll do what I can to help in the mines."
"204987124-0-19202";"Lord Diel's not trying to end the harpy threat?"
"204987124-0-19203";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-19205";"No, I'm not. Have you ever seen my face before?"
"204987124-0-19206";"Baham told me to pass out bandages and ointment."
"204987124-0-19211";"How do you justify abuse?"
"204987124-0-19212";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-19213";"I'd prefer to see for myself."
"204987124-0-19214";"Why are you buying bandages?"
"204987124-0-19215";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-19217";"Where will you be?"
"204987124-0-19218";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-19220";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-19221";"Don't you already have weapons?"
"204987124-0-19222";"This was everyone you could muster?"
"204987124-0-19223";"Don't worry. I'll get Ilara out of the cave."
"204987124-0-19224";"Aren't you a mage? Why don't you just leave?"
"204987124-0-19226";"Destroy the supplies with a crystal that may backfire on me?"
"204987124-0-19228";"Is this something I can get some help with?"
"204987124-0-19230";"Why are you helping me?"
"204987124-0-19231";"I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty good at hurting people."
"204987124-0-19238";"Which houses exactly?"
"204987124-0-19242";"I've been nice so far. Don't make me change my mind."
"204987124-0-19251";"Where can I find your father?"
"204987124-0-19252";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-19253";"Tell me more about this spell."
"204987124-0-19259";"I just want to visit the school."
"204987124-0-19260";"Why would a bandit try to sneak into a village full of evil cultists?"
"204987124-0-19261";"I'd like to sail to Mournhold."
"204987124-0-19265";"Tell me about B."
"204987124-0-19266";"Tell me about A."
"204987124-0-19267";"Tell me about A."
"204987124-0-19271";"I'm ready. [Start Race]"
"204987124-0-19274";"<Place the masking salve.>"
"204987124-0-19281";"<Place and light the candle.>"
"204987124-0-19283";"<Place the shrouding ashes.>"
"204987124-0-19295";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-19297";"How do we turn it on?"
"204987124-0-19298";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-19299";"I'm sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-19300";"Why didn't you just sneak inside with the elixir?"
"204987124-0-19301";"Who are you after?"
"204987124-0-19302";"Have you figured out who the Maulborn really are?"
"204987124-0-19303";"Balthil says he'll never go to sea again. Sea sickness."
"204987124-0-19304";"Anala's too afraid of the Maormer to go to sea again anytime soon."
"204987124-0-19305";"Actually, the Maormer are moving on Auridon. Degail was captured walking on the shore."
"204987124-0-19307";"Your crew's all accounted for, then?"
"204987124-0-19308";"Let's do it!"
"204987124-0-19315";"Ask your riddle."
"204987124-0-19316";"I won't betray your trust."
"204987124-0-19319";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-19321";"Oh, that Morag Tong."
"204987124-0-19343";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-19344";"Nothing good. Have you tried the gate?"
"204987124-0-19345";"Why?"
"204987124-0-19348";"You're on your own. Glenumbra is more important. I'm going to stop the Bloodthorns."
"204987124-0-19350";"Thank you for speaking with me."
"204987124-0-19352";"I think you've got the right idea."
"204987124-0-19353";"I'm sorry, Tamien."
"204987124-0-19354";"Yes. What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-19356";"I hope it works. Here."
"204987124-0-19366";"Ask your riddle."
"204987124-0-19372";"It's over now. Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-19374";"I'll be fighting other recruits?"
"204987124-0-19376";"I'll pass these out. Thank you, Nurad."
"204987124-0-19377";"Why do I have to drink the mead?"
"204987124-0-19378";"What are these spirit fires you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-19379";"What are these spirit fires you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-19380";"Why is a priest of Kyne proctoring this Trial?"
"204987124-0-19381";"This all seems a bit strange. Ask you a few questions about this Trial?"
"204987124-0-19388";"I'll do what I can to help them."
"204987124-0-19391";"Do you know why the village was attacked?"
"204987124-0-19395";"And you think destroying Lodorr will bring you back into favor?"
"204987124-0-19396";"Who is Lodorr?"
"204987124-0-19397";"How did you lose your job as Archmage to the King?"
"204987124-0-19399";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-19401";"Where do your goods come from?"
"204987124-0-19402";"Can you show me the door?"
"204987124-0-19403";"Who is the Mane?"
"204987124-0-19404";"We have a deal."
"204987124-0-19405";"<<1>> is just a bumpkin. How would he know to preserve it?"
"204987124-0-19408";"Play the Speaking Stone's message."
"204987124-0-19409";"An adventure? Here?"
"204987124-0-19415";"Would that be a bad thing?"
"204987124-0-19417";"Did you find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-19418";"Head back to the village. I'll try to find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-19426";"Follow me, then."
"204987124-0-19427";"What made you come to Crosswych."
"204987124-0-19429";"Why did you come to Crosswych?"
"204987124-0-19431";"The Queen's not here, is she?"
"204987124-0-19432";"Do you know who that Mage was?"
"204987124-0-19433";"Why were you and the Queen's entourage out here?"
"204987124-0-19434";"Concentrate, Merion. How were you going to make the potion?"
"204987124-0-19437";"Does your lady buy portals often?"
"204987124-0-19441";"Why was he thrown out?"
"204987124-0-19443";"Experiments? Like emotional manipulation?"
"204987124-0-19446";"What's the Academy of Magic?"
"204987124-0-19449";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-19452";"How do you get to the Academy?"
"204987124-0-19453";"I'll find this decanter."
"204987124-0-19458";"If the lens was so dangerous, why keep it around?"
"204987124-0-19459";"What did you hear?"
"204987124-0-19461";"The Academy is safe?"
"204987124-0-19462";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-19464";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-19466";"Can you get it open?"
"204987124-0-19471";"Can we improve the situation?"
"204987124-0-19472";"You just abandoned them to die?"
"204987124-0-19475";"You don't understand. Estre is the Veiled Queen."
"204987124-0-19477";"No. Your Majesty, Estre is the Veiled Queen."
"204987124-0-19478";"Where can I find the stones?"
"204987124-0-19480";"She escaped, your Majesty."
"204987124-0-19481";"I defeated the Veiled Council and met their leader. Estre used magic to contact them."
"204987124-0-19484";"And Earran?"
"204987124-0-19487";"Here, take the crown."
"204987124-0-19489";"Why does this place only train Wood Elves and Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-19490";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-19495";"<Enter the mine>"
"204987124-0-19497";"Indoctrination?"
"204987124-0-19498";"Very well."
"204987124-0-19499";"Is it possible the Daedra attack was meant to catch her?"
"204987124-0-19501";"Anything else I can do while I'm here?"
"204987124-0-19504";"And that's when the Daedra showed up?"
"204987124-0-19506";"I can't believe you treat these people like that."
"204987124-0-19512";"Fine. Is there anything else I should see?"
"204987124-0-19513";"Is there anything else I should see?"
"204987124-0-19517";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-19518";"Have you seen Ilara or anyone else go past here?"
"204987124-0-19519";"Where did they go?"
"204987124-0-19521";"I can lead you out. It's not safe with all these spiders in here."
"204987124-0-19524";"Well, I need to get inside the quarantine. Any ideas on how I could do that?"
"204987124-0-19525";"Let me guess? Your coin purse is hungry."
"204987124-0-19527";"Thanks. Hope your coin purse feels better."
"204987124-0-19531";"Vestige?"
"204987124-0-19532";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-19539";"I just want to return your daggers."
"204987124-0-19543";"The shrines have been cleansed. Aren't the relics safe now?"
"204987124-0-19545";"Can you talk more about what goes on here?"
"204987124-0-19546";"What was it about the agenda that you couldn't represent?"
"204987124-0-19552";"[Hendil Lives] Wait. You're better than that. Don't do it."
"204987124-0-19553";"Just head home. Nelulin will be fine for now. I'll talk to Netanwe."
"204987124-0-19556";"Try to remember what happened to the daggers."
"204987124-0-19562";"Right. The salve knocked people out. His son was a vampire."
"204987124-0-19563";"Explain yourself."
"204987124-0-19564";"Anchor?"
"204987124-0-19567";"All right. Stay close then."
"204987124-0-19568";"How did you die?"
"204987124-0-19569";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-19575";"I left him tied up down in the mine. Be careful, the villagers down there are dangerous."
"204987124-0-19576";"Do I need to go get your sister?"
"204987124-0-19577";"Why did Mim stab you?"
"204987124-0-19579";"Stay here. I'll plant the seeds for you."
"204987124-0-19580";"Strange seeds?"
"204987124-0-19581";"You need to get a hold of yourself. I'm going to help you."
"204987124-0-19582";"Thallik gave you no instructions at all?"
"204987124-0-19583";"What did Thallik say the rune does?"
"204987124-0-19584";"Don't give up. Remember why we came here."
"204987124-0-19586";"I'll find the shadow for you."
"204987124-0-19587";"You lost something? Let me help you find it."
"204987124-0-19588";"You need to get out of here."
"204987124-0-19590";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-19592";"If you insist. Here's the journal."
"204987124-0-19594";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-19595";"What is this harbor defense thing?"
"204987124-0-19596";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-19597";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-19598";"All right. What are the rules?"
"204987124-0-19601";"That guar was your wife."
"204987124-0-19603";"This isn't my armor. It belongs to your wife."
"204987124-0-19605";"Don't you want your lute back?"
"204987124-0-19610";"I saw a transcript of your interrogation. Did Thragof know you were married to a Breton?"
"204987124-0-19612";"I'm freeing you. Make for the rally point."
"204987124-0-19613";"That sounds reasonable."
"204987124-0-19616";"I'm freeing you. Make for the rally point."
"204987124-0-19617";"Where would he keep your souls?"
"204987124-0-19618";"That sounds very important."
"204987124-0-19620";"And who is Condalin, again?"
"204987124-0-19621";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-19623";"I see."
"204987124-0-19624";"Who's in charge?"
"204987124-0-19625";"I'm looking for anyone that knows <<1>>."
"204987124-0-19626";"There are a lot of Wood Elves and Khajiit around. They work the forge?"
"204987124-0-19627";"Doesn't seem all that fair."
"204987124-0-19628";"What's your job here?"
"204987124-0-19630";"Is there a problem with how the workers are treated?"
"204987124-0-19631";"Sounds bad."
"204987124-0-19632";"You don't mind working beside Wood Elves and Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-19633";"Is that common?"
"204987124-0-19635";"They're not just busy?"
"204987124-0-19636";"I'm looking for anyone that knows <<1>>."
"204987124-0-19637";"Are the blades here really worth that aggravation?"
"204987124-0-19639";"These survivors should be told the truth."
"204987124-0-19642";"I will look for you in the Hollow City."
"204987124-0-19645";"He wouldn't want you to die here, waiting for him."
"204987124-0-19646";"If the Daedra hear you, they're not going to give you time to look."
"204987124-0-19647";"Yes. Just head south out of town."
"204987124-0-19650";"I will. Just get going."
"204987124-0-19651";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-19654";"Keep looking. I'll do the same."
"204987124-0-19655";"You'll find her better alive than dead. Get moving."
"204987124-0-19657";"Be safe."
"204987124-0-19658";"<Take the pendant.>"
"204987124-0-19660";"The soldiers will keep you safe."
"204987124-0-19661";"Good luck, Fasaran."
"204987124-0-19667";"Do you think he's all right?"
"204987124-0-19668";"Where are you from?"
"204987124-0-19670";"Why would it be your fault?"
"204987124-0-19672";"You mentioned other misfortunes?"
"204987124-0-19673";"She mentioned a treasure. What are you looking for?"
"204987124-0-19675";"Tell me about the whirlpool that brought you here."
"204987124-0-19676";"How did you know where to look?"
"204987124-0-19677";"Why did you sail into something called the Cursed Sea?"
"204987124-0-19678";"Tell me about the whirlpool that brought you here?"
"204987124-0-19679";"I know a safe haven in this place. I could lead you and your crew to it."
"204987124-0-19680";"What was the whirlpool that pulled in your ship?"
"204987124-0-19681";"Why are you interested in these wrecked ships?"
"204987124-0-19682";"What was your specialty?"
"204987124-0-19684";"I'll protect you."
"204987124-0-19686";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-19687";"A playground?"
"204987124-0-19694";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-19704";"You were caught in a Daedric spell."
"204987124-0-19706";"Why don't you refuse to work?"
"204987124-0-19708";"I'll give you what you want if you make me part of the plan."
"204987124-0-19709";"Do you know anything about these ruins?"
"204987124-0-19710";"You should head for safety. I'll find Telenger."
"204987124-0-19711";"Where's Telenger now?"
"204987124-0-19712";"But you said yourself it's probably cursed."
"204987124-0-19713";"Shouldn't you tell the villagers what really happened?"
"204987124-0-19715";"All right, here."
"204987124-0-19717";"I don't know. This relic is dangerous."
"204987124-0-19718";"""But first,"" what?"
"204987124-0-19723";"Will your mother be safe up here?"
"204987124-0-19724";"I'm sorry, but your father is dead. I found his pendant."
"204987124-0-19727";"Take the pendant and head out of town. I'm sorry, Elannie."
"204987124-0-19728";"You need to forgive Bernt. He's the only family you have left."
"204987124-0-19730";"What are you thinking about?"
"204987124-0-19732";"Do you think it's dangerous?"
"204987124-0-19734";"Tell me more about this mask."
"204987124-0-19736";"Recover the three pieces of the mask. Got it."
"204987124-0-19739";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-19748";"I wish to speak to the others before choosing a side."
"204987124-0-19749";"I'm sure."
"204987124-0-19750";"I'm sure."
"204987124-0-19751";"I'm sure."
"204987124-0-19752";"I'll side with Angof."
"204987124-0-19757";"I'll take care of them, Captain."
"204987124-0-19759";"Another crime for the magistrates. I'll track her after we deal with these Daedra."
"204987124-0-19760";"Dawnbreak was a distraction. Firsthold is Estre's true target."
"204987124-0-19762";"Can you get a warning there in time?"
"204987124-0-19763";"I'll get it for you, for your mother's sake."
"204987124-0-19765";"So I'll take out the captains, you take down the wards?"
"204987124-0-19766";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-19769";"Is that why everyone is up in arms?"
"204987124-0-19773";"Then why do you keep fighting?"
"204987124-0-19774";"I'll deal with the other champions."
"204987124-0-19775";"How do we win the game?"
"204987124-0-19776";"Well …."
"204987124-0-19778";"Do you just stay within the tavern?"
"204987124-0-19779";"Do you just stay within the tavern?"
"204987124-0-19780";"You have no souls?"
"204987124-0-19781";"They were controlled by the other leaders. I freed them and they ran off."
"204987124-0-19783";"The Observer told me to come collect my reward."
"204987124-0-19786";"I will."
"204987124-0-19787";"I will."
"204987124-0-19808";"I'll find Lady Estre's mask."
"204987124-0-19810";"I'm ready. What do I have to do?"
"204987124-0-19811";"My soul, huh? I'm ready. Go ahead."
"204987124-0-19813";"[Lie] I pledge my life and soul to the Heritance and the Veiled Queen."
"204987124-0-19814";"Oh, I understand. You're keeping a low profile."
"204987124-0-19816";"[Lie] He took the helm and fled through a magic portal. I don't think we'll ever see him again."
"204987124-0-19818";"Yes. Someday."
"204987124-0-19820";"I'm sorry, Elanwe."
"204987124-0-19823";"What now?"
"204987124-0-19837";"You're a painter?"
"204987124-0-19838";"Xarxes?"
"204987124-0-19843";"What are my options?"
"204987124-0-19844";"May I speak to them before I decide?"
"204987124-0-19847";"So what do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-19849";"And what will you be doing while I get my hands dirty?"
"204987124-0-19850";"They were controlled by the other leaders. I freed them and they ran off."
"204987124-0-19852";"The Observer told me to come collect my reward."
"204987124-0-19853";"What are my options?"
"204987124-0-19856";"May I speak to them before I decide?"
"204987124-0-19857";"Stop blaming <<1>> because you don't know how to bargain."
"204987124-0-19858";"Just tell me what we need to do to win."
"204987124-0-19860";"Do you think I can beat them?"
"204987124-0-19863";"They were controlled by the other leaders. I freed them and they ran off."
"204987124-0-19864";"Can I see the stone?"
"204987124-0-19866";"The Observer told me to come collect my reward."
"204987124-0-19867";"What are my options?"
"204987124-0-19870";"May I speak to them before I decide?"
"204987124-0-19877";"What's your job here?"
"204987124-0-19879";"That sounds awful."
"204987124-0-19880";"Do the workers get treated well?"
"204987124-0-19881";"You don't mind working beside Bosmer and Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-19882";"Sounds good! What are my choices today?"
"204987124-0-19884";"One soup? That's not many soups!"
"204987124-0-19885";"What's it all mean?"
"204987124-0-19886";"All right, then. How do we fix this?"
"204987124-0-19890";"Hold still."
"204987124-0-19893";"You apparently enjoy the mead."
"204987124-0-19896";"What did you say about the mead?"
"204987124-0-19897";"What is the Trial of Spirit?"
"204987124-0-19900";"I'll talk to Nelhilda."
"204987124-0-19904";"You're a Breton. Don't you remember?"
"204987124-0-19908";"Dispel the energies around the monoliths. Right."
"204987124-0-19914";"So the Daedric influence is in these monoliths?"
"204987124-0-19915";"Where did the Daedric influence come from?"
"204987124-0-19916";"Where will we find the Admiral?"
"204987124-0-19917";"All right. I'll collect a bear for you."
"204987124-0-19920";"Very well. I found this key in the journal."
"204987124-0-19922";"And I'll take care of the puppetmaster. Be right back."
"204987124-0-19923";"So the Daedra were to control the animals through the monoliths?"
"204987124-0-19925";"Thank you for being honest."
"204987124-0-19927";"Phaer suffered no plague. It was a vampire. Hendil's son."
"204987124-0-19929";"A crazed person on the beach mentioned you. What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-19930";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-19931";"You don't see all these cats?"
"204987124-0-19934";"The Sload? What are they?"

"204987124-0-19940";"Maybe you'd have more fun after a night in the city dungeon?"
"204987124-0-19944";"Your daughter is trying to end the enchantment."
"204987124-0-19947";"She couldn't wait for more help?"
"204987124-0-19949";"I'll find her, Sergeant. Don't worry."
"204987124-0-19950";"Does he enter the field often?"
"204987124-0-19951";"Could you tell me something of Telenger?"
"204987124-0-19953";"Why are you talking like that?"
"204987124-0-19954";"Maybe you should compete in the drinking contest."
"204987124-0-19955";"Does anyone ever leave the tavern?"
"204987124-0-19956";"You bet on the games?"
"204987124-0-19959";"What kinds of things do you sell?"
"204987124-0-19960";"Who is Telenger?"
"204987124-0-19965";"All this just so you can serve Molag Bal once more?"
"204987124-0-19967";"You want to be mortal?"
"204987124-0-19968";"What other purpose?"
"204987124-0-19970";"Tell me how the death rune works."
"204987124-0-19972";"What do you really want?"

"204987124-0-19982";"Can't? Or won't?"
"204987124-0-19983";"Not safe? Is that why there's a barrier on the door?"
"204987124-0-19986";"You want me to just leave you here?"
"204987124-0-19987";"How can I catch her?"
"204987124-0-19990";"But you'd be a great help in my efforts against Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-19994";"I'll bring her back, too."
"204987124-0-19995";"I'll take the mages with me."
"204987124-0-20000";"Give me Angof and the mages or I'll make sure the balance is never restored."

"204987124-0-20006";"I'll take the mages with me."
"204987124-0-20010";"Give me Thallik and the mages or I'll make sure the balance is never restored."
"204987124-0-20011";"I'll find the next fragment of your soul and free it."
"204987124-0-20012";"Shouldn't I select Thallik? He is more powerful than you."
"204987124-0-20015";"I think the mages would be a better choice."
"204987124-0-20021";"Why isn't Drulis convinced?"
"204987124-0-20024";"I'll free the last fragment of your soul."
"204987124-0-20026";"I'll give it a shot. But what if I can only choose one of you?"
"204987124-0-20029";"The Observer wants me to choose between the mages and Lady Estre."
"204987124-0-20032";"I'll take the mages with me."
"204987124-0-20036";"Give me Estre and the mages or I'll make sure the balance is never restored."

"204987124-0-20042";"What's so special about the amulet?"
"204987124-0-20043";"A fool?"
"204987124-0-20047";"Do you live there?"
"204987124-0-20049";"What can you tell me about the area?"
"204987124-0-20050";"Tell me about Stillrise."
"204987124-0-20051";"Tell me about Mud Tree Village."
"204987124-0-20052";"What do you know about Zuuk?"
"204987124-0-20053";"What can you tell me about Stillrise?"
"204987124-0-20054";"The amulet sounds safe. I'm sure he means you no harm."
"204987124-0-20056";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-20058";"But will killing those Daedra free you?"
"204987124-0-20059";"Tell me about these caretakers."
"204987124-0-20061";"I think he's already learned his lesson."
"204987124-0-20062";"A just decision."
"204987124-0-20064";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-20067";"So how can I help?"
"204987124-0-20068";"You mentioned someone named Skordo?"
"204987124-0-20069";"Go on."
"204987124-0-20071";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-20074";"And how do they win this game?"
"204987124-0-20082";"And what's my role in all this?"
"204987124-0-20083";"All right. I'll get the uniform."
"204987124-0-20084";"You two were close?"
"204987124-0-20087";"What do they make you do down here?"
"204987124-0-20088";"Are all these prisoners from the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-20089";"And release Dame Dabienne from the stocks."
"204987124-0-20090";"I spoke to the Dremora."
"204987124-0-20091";"Why haven't you tried to escape?"
"204987124-0-20092";"What's to stop me from just killing you right now?"
"204987124-0-20096";"Yes, just outside on the road."
"204987124-0-20097";"Whatever you say."
"204987124-0-20100";"I'll side with Angof."
"204987124-0-20101";"Who attacked <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20102";"Can I do anything to help?"
"204987124-0-20103";"Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-20104";"Who attacked <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20105";"Where can I find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20107";"I'll find out what they know."
"204987124-0-20108";"You were imprisoned last time, too. I helped you."
"204987124-0-20109";"I'm helping the Fighters Guild find a way out of here."
"204987124-0-20112";"Tell me more about the Knights of the Flame."
"204987124-0-20114";"Do you know where he was going?"
"204987124-0-20115";"Can you tell me what happened in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20116";"Can you tell me what happened in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20117";"What do you know about the marsh?"

"204987124-0-20122";"Can you tell me what happened in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20123";"What can you tell me about the marsh?"
"204987124-0-20124";"<<1>> said you needed help."
"204987124-0-20125";"<<1>> mentioned something about <<2>>'s garrison?"
"204987124-0-20126";"Are you certain it's poison?"
"204987124-0-20127";"Tell me more about the slaver attack."
"204987124-0-20128";"Years of your life stolen? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-20132";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-20134";"Can't I just kill them?"
"204987124-0-20139";"You're wrong. I don't work with slavers."
"204987124-0-20140";"Calm down. Tell me how you became a slave."
"204987124-0-20142";"Here, have a look at what she stole."
"204987124-0-20145";"This should be enough to buy your freedom."
"204987124-0-20154";"You're just going to take her and leave?"
"204987124-0-20155";"This is none of my business. Here, take your things. I'll be on my way."
"204987124-0-20156";"You're just going to take her and leave?"
"204987124-0-20161";"This should be enough to buy your freedom."
"204987124-0-20163";"They're bringing bodies to <<1>>'s fort for some kind of necromantic ritual."
"204987124-0-20164";"He's in an abandoned house near the outer walls."
"204987124-0-20168";"I'm not a spy. I'm trying to help."
"204987124-0-20169";"I have a few questions."
"204987124-0-20183";"Don't you realize how paranoid you sound?"
"204987124-0-20184";"And now you want me to talk to her?"
"204987124-0-20186";"I need to help the Khajiit."
"204987124-0-20187";"I need to know more before I agree to this."
"204987124-0-20188";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-20189";"Why me?"
"204987124-0-20190";"He mentioned something about his dreams."
"204987124-0-20192";"Who are the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-20193";"I should investigate the constable's house."
"204987124-0-20194";"How do I get the key?"
"204987124-0-20196";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-20200";"What does the token do?"
"204987124-0-20202";"Who could it be?"
"204987124-0-20204";"What's their ultimate goal?"
"204987124-0-20205";"Can you tell me more about the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-20206";"Can you tell me more about the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-20207";"What's it like working for the Queen?"
"204987124-0-20208";"And second?"
"204987124-0-20210";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20211";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20212";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"

"204987124-0-20214";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20216";"You mean King Emeric will be vulnerable now as well?"
"204987124-0-20218";"That's usually what it means."
"204987124-0-20219";"I can get him for you."
"204987124-0-20220";"I can get him for you."
"204987124-0-20221";"I'll tell him, Kazargi."
"204987124-0-20222";"All right."
"204987124-0-20224";"Eilram is trying to get everyone out of here. You should talk to him."
"204987124-0-20226";"And you can direct me to Ifriz?"
"204987124-0-20237";"Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-20240";"Sorry, what?"
"204987124-0-20242";"Right. How'd you get down here, anyway?"
"204987124-0-20243";"What now?"
"204987124-0-20244";"Where is Condalin?"
"204987124-0-20252";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20255";"Why did the Mages Guild come to <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-20261";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20268";"What's your problem with the chief? Is it <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-20270";"You seem nervous, is there something you aren't telling me?"
"204987124-0-20272";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20273";"What did they find?"
"204987124-0-20274";"Stolen? By who?"
"204987124-0-20276";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-20278";"Those defenses didn't prevent the bandits from getting in."
"204987124-0-20284";"<<1>> worked the forge herself that day."
"204987124-0-20285";"<<1>> wants to speak with you."
"204987124-0-20286";"You poisoned them for their own good?"
"204987124-0-20287";"You can tell <<1>> yourself."
"204987124-0-20288";"How did you have time to cut out the venom sacs?"
"204987124-0-20289";"I'll think about it, but in the meantime I need to bring you to <<1>> so you can't hurt anyone else."
"204987124-0-20290";"<<1>> will want to speak with you."
"204987124-0-20293";"We made a deal."
"204987124-0-20294";"I can't help you if you don't tell me everything."
"204987124-0-20296";"Tell me who."
"204987124-0-20297";"Show me the way in."
"204987124-0-20299";"Show me the way in."

"204987124-0-20331";"The blacksmith is involved too?"
"204987124-0-20333";"Losing your challenge doesn't excuse what you've done."
"204987124-0-20334";"You believe the blade was sabotaged?"
"204987124-0-20337";"Then why would you attack your own people?"
"204987124-0-20339";"Isn't there a way to avoid further bloodshed?"
"204987124-0-20340";"And who's Vox?"
"204987124-0-20341";"Why didn't you move against Giron earlier?"

"204987124-0-20391";"Give me the frog. Or I take the frog."
"204987124-0-20394";"Then I have to enter him. Show these low-lifes what they're dealing with."
"204987124-0-20396";"Consider your frog hired."

"204987124-0-21122";"I'm not going to trick someone into killing themselves. [<<1>> dies.]"
"204987124-0-21127";"What about the Wood Elves and Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-21128";"And you, Merric."
"204987124-0-21131";"I'm not sure I believe you."
"204987124-0-21132";"He wouldn't submit to Magistrix Vox. His spirit helped me save Selfora."
"204987124-0-21133";"He wanted you to know he loves you."
"204987124-0-21135";"Your father wants you to carry on."
"204987124-0-21136";"This spirit will aid me in battle?"
"204987124-0-21138";"Couldn't one of you fight at my side?"
"204987124-0-21140";"The Merethic Era?"
"204987124-0-21141";"I'll get the staff from the Prince."
"204987124-0-21142";"Can you tell me again about the essences?"
"204987124-0-21143";"What were you saying about the statues?"
"204987124-0-21144";"What were you saying about the statues?"
"204987124-0-21145";"How do I collect them?"
"204987124-0-21146";"How do you know all this, Arch-Mage?"
"204987124-0-21147";"So I'm imbuing the essences back into the statues?"
"204987124-0-21153";"What's the Blood of Mauloch?"
"204987124-0-21154";"Sounds easy enough. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-21155";"All right. I'm ready for the disguise."
"204987124-0-21157";"Why Arithiel? What has she done?"
"204987124-0-21160";"All right?"
"204987124-0-21161";"By stopping the Worm Cult from summoning Mauloch?"
"204987124-0-21168";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-21169";"Why'd they attack you?"
"204987124-0-21170";"I understand."
"204987124-0-21172";"House Hlaalu may send others if Raston doesn't return."
"204987124-0-21173";"Does he know how to free her?"
"204987124-0-21174";"What was that shadow wolf creature?"
"204987124-0-21175";"Can't you stop it?"
"204987124-0-21176";"This is not the future your daughter wants for the tribe either."
"204987124-0-21177";"May I ask you some questions?"
"204987124-0-21181";"I'm ready. Take me to the arena."
"204987124-0-21184";"To me? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-21187";"Who are these suitors?"
"204987124-0-21188";"Thanks. I'll look for it."
"204987124-0-21189";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-21191";"Let's move."
"204987124-0-21194";"What was that about Aphren's Hold?"
"204987124-0-21195";"Who were these other people?"
"204987124-0-21196";"You mentioned the countess has suitors?"
"204987124-0-21197";"Almalexia wants to see me?"
"204987124-0-21199";"What happens if I don't stop them?"
"204987124-0-21200";"Fight it! Help me solve the puzzle!"
"204987124-0-21201";"I'll use it if I need to."
"204987124-0-21203";"What kind of trouble?"
"204987124-0-21204";"Almalexia wants to speak to me."
"204987124-0-21205";"I'll speak with her."
"204987124-0-21206";"I think you've got the right idea."
"204987124-0-21207";"I promise."
"204987124-0-21208";"You were slaves?"
"204987124-0-21210";"Dignitaries? Who are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-21211";"I'll hear you out."
"204987124-0-21214";"You don't have to do that."
"204987124-0-21216";"Why were you deceiving these Goblins?"
"204987124-0-21217";"And you think you should be spared despite this?"
"204987124-0-21220";"Get out and don't come back. <Spare her.>"
"204987124-0-21221";"Thank you, Sacred Lady."
"204987124-0-21222";"They don't work for us?"
"204987124-0-21224";"Can you tell me more about the lantern you gave me?"
"204987124-0-21225";"And you think the war could undo that?"
"204987124-0-21226";"Starting over?"
"204987124-0-21228";"You expect me to just walk away?"
"204987124-0-21229";"How did you lose this sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-21230";"Why have you returned?"
"204987124-0-21232";"But Arcole made a sleeping potion out of puffball caps. I put it in the guards' drinking kegs."
"204987124-0-21236";"Simple enough."
"204987124-0-21237";"Tell me more about Sir Brice."
"204987124-0-21239";"Riddle'Thar?"
"204987124-0-21240";"If you insist."
"204987124-0-21241";"Who is the Mane?"
"204987124-0-21243";"Right."
"204987124-0-21244";"So you want to check out the farm?"
"204987124-0-21245";"Have a safe journey."
"204987124-0-21246";"So?"
"204987124-0-21247";"What about the Altmer?"
"204987124-0-21248";"What about Sir Brice?"
"204987124-0-21250";"Deal. I'll find the caches and meet you outside the cave."
"204987124-0-21251";"Is he always like that?"
"204987124-0-21255";"How do I know you won't just run?"
"204987124-0-21256";"Yarelion is an Altmer?"
"204987124-0-21259";"How?"
"204987124-0-21263";"I'll do it, for Raerana."
"204987124-0-21264";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-21265";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-21266";"Can you tell me more about Yarelion?"
"204987124-0-21267";"Yes, but I need to know who gave her the mirror."
"204987124-0-21268";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-21271";"Slip the poison in an open bottle, wait for him to fall over, and grab the key. Got it."
"204987124-0-21272";"What are you going to do with him?"
"204987124-0-21273";"Can we defeat Sinmur without Wuuthrad's shards?"
"204987124-0-21274";"What else can you tell me about the shards of Wuuthrad?"
"204987124-0-21275";"What else can you tell me about the shards of Wuuthrad?"
"204987124-0-21276";"What else can you tell me about the shards of Wuuthrad?"
"204987124-0-21277";"What if the Drublog don't leave after <<1>> is dead?"
"204987124-0-21278";"What else can you tell me about the shards of Wuuthrad?"
"204987124-0-21279";"You respect your captain less than <<1>> did. Why is that?"
"204987124-0-21280";"What if the Drublog don't quit?"
"204987124-0-21281";"You want me to decide Raston's fate?"
"204987124-0-21283";"What about Yarelion?"
"204987124-0-21284";"What about Sir Brice?"
"204987124-0-21286";"Tell me more about Yarelion."
"204987124-0-21287";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-21288";"What about Sir Brice?"
"204987124-0-21289";"What about Yarelion?"
"204987124-0-21290";"What can you tell me about Yarelion?"
"204987124-0-21291";"Why do they call this place the Vale of the Ghost Snake?"
"204987124-0-21300";"Where is he?"
"204987124-0-21302";"You were right. There's something wrong with Valaste."
"204987124-0-21308";"Did you steal from Headman Bhosek?"
"204987124-0-21310";"What would you ask?"
"204987124-0-21311";"I'm ready. What's next?"
"204987124-0-21312";"Why do you need me to guide you?"
"204987124-0-21314";"We had a deal. You agreed to transport <<1>>."
"204987124-0-21316";"Get to the western bridge. Your brother will meet you there."
"204987124-0-21317";"What do you know about Sir Brice?"
"204987124-0-21319";"Where is she?"
"204987124-0-21320";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-21321";"I'll talk to her."
"204987124-0-21322";"I'll go talk to the captain now."
"204987124-0-21324";"Did you raise an alarm?"
"204987124-0-21326";"Why did you hide? Why not fight back?"
"204987124-0-21327";"I've heard enough."
"204987124-0-21333";"What's so important about the Tear of Saint Veloth?"
"204987124-0-21337";"Why are the Drublog doing this?"
"204987124-0-21338";"What was that illusion on the watchtower?"
"204987124-0-21339";"The realm of memory?"
"204987124-0-21340";"You mentioned the Crystal Tower earlier …."
"204987124-0-21341";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-21342";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-21347";"First, tell me what they are and why you've got them."
"204987124-0-21348";"You killed someone."
"204987124-0-21350";"I've already killed their leader."
"204987124-0-21351";"You want me to kill both of them?"
"204987124-0-21352";"You want me to kill both of them?"
"204987124-0-21353";"You mentioned the Crystal Tower earlier …."
"204987124-0-21354";"Who were the Ayleids?"
"204987124-0-21355";"Telenger?"
"204987124-0-21356";"What happened in Bangkorai?"
"204987124-0-21357";"What happened to the students in Bangkorai?"
"204987124-0-21364";"All right. Here you are."
"204987124-0-21365";"You must have known that was a lie."
"204987124-0-21366";"What about Trynhild?"
"204987124-0-21367";"You must have known that was a lie."
"204987124-0-21368";"What about Denskar? Littrek?"
"204987124-0-21369";"The Mabrigash? Ghost Snake?"
"204987124-0-21370";"You must have known that was a lie."
"204987124-0-21372";"It was. I hope you find someone better."
"204987124-0-21373";"I can't let you live. You betrayed the Pact."
"204987124-0-21374";"I can't let you live. You betrayed me and the Pact."
"204987124-0-21375";"I can't let you live. You betrayed me and the Pact."
"204987124-0-21379";"Anything else you can tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-21385";"Indeed. I hope you find someone better."
"204987124-0-21386";"He wanted to make amends to his daughter."
"204987124-0-21389";"How did she die?"
"204987124-0-21390";"How did she die?"
"204987124-0-21391";"How did she die?"
"204987124-0-21392";"How did your friends and family feel about the marriage?"
"204987124-0-21398";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-21399";"And Aelif? Who is she?"
"204987124-0-21400";"The contract you mentioned, who placed it?"
"204987124-0-21403";"What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-21405";"That's an interesting suggestion."
"204987124-0-21407";"Who are the bandits?"
"204987124-0-21409";"So does Dro-Dara own the plantation?"
"204987124-0-21410";"Tell me more about your companions."
"204987124-0-21411";"So does Dro-Dara own the plantation?"
"204987124-0-21412";"You seem to know a lot about these tunnels."
"204987124-0-21414";"Daedric wards? What aren't you telling me, Naryu?"
"204987124-0-21415";"What's a Ra Gada?"
"204987124-0-21418";"What sort of document?"
"204987124-0-21419";"Consider it done."
"204987124-0-21420";"I've heard the Maulborn are in Mournhold."
"204987124-0-21421";"Will you miss Janne?"
"204987124-0-21422";"Janne said you used to be mage."
"204987124-0-21423";"You have no interest in trying to rebuild?"
"204987124-0-21424";"Will you miss Janne?"
"204987124-0-21425";"Tell me something about yourself?"
"204987124-0-21426";"Who were these people?"
"204987124-0-21428";"So you'll release Raston?"
"204987124-0-21429";"Then we must act quickly. Follow me."
"204987124-0-21430";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-21432";"A siege? The scout said something about spirits."
"204987124-0-21433";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-21434";"This way. The exit to the south should be secure."
"204987124-0-21436";"I will get you this heart."
"204987124-0-21441";"Tell me about the gear."
"204987124-0-21442";"And about the relic?"
"204987124-0-21443";"And about the gear?"
"204987124-0-21444";"What did you think of those other objects I found?"
"204987124-0-21445";"You must have done something to anger the Farseer."
"204987124-0-21448";"Are you sure that's all you did?"
"204987124-0-21449";"I'll talk to the Farseer."
"204987124-0-21451";"Can you tell me more about the offering?"
"204987124-0-21452";"Tell me about Jakarn."
"204987124-0-21454";"I'll look for Lerisa. How do I find her?"
"204987124-0-21455";"Who runs Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-21456";"I'll look for Jakarn. How do I get to him?"
"204987124-0-21457";"Who runs Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-21458";"I'll look for Neramo. Where do I find him?"
"204987124-0-21459";"Who runs Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-21463";"Doesn't anyone stand up to him?"
"204987124-0-21464";"Where can I get a drink around here?"
"204987124-0-21465";"Anyone I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-21466";"Who runs Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-21467";"Who is King Fahara'jad?"
"204987124-0-21468";"Who runs Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-21469";"Tell me about those Daedric Anchors."
"204987124-0-21470";"I can try to find out what happened to Raston."
"204987124-0-21471";"I can try to find out what happened to Raston."
"204987124-0-21472";"How would Mauloch play into their plans?"
"204987124-0-21473";"We'll stop them."
"204987124-0-21476";"I saw a ghost here, on the island. He claimed to be the last Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-21477";"May I ask you some questions?"
"204987124-0-21478";"Is there really a Ghost Snake here?"
"204987124-0-21479";"What did Raston do to anger the tribe?"
"204987124-0-21480";"Is there really a Ghost Snake here?"
"204987124-0-21481";"How did Raston insult the Farseer?"
"204987124-0-21482";"Is there really a Ghost Snake here?"
"204987124-0-21483";"Is there really a Ghost Snake here?"
"204987124-0-21484";"I'm here to rescue Crafty Lerisa, captain of the Maiden's Breath."
"204987124-0-21486";"All right. What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-21487";"What if I need a disguise?"
"204987124-0-21490";"You and <<1>> were lovers?"
"204987124-0-21492";"He told me where Merric was. He seemed rushed."
"204987124-0-21493";"I saw a ghost here, on the island. He claimed to be the last Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-21496";"How long do you think it will take to decipher the journal?"
"204987124-0-21497";"And you've turned away from the Worm Cult for good?"
"204987124-0-21500";"Where should I go?"
"204987124-0-21501";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-21503";"How do I find the parts and reforge the sword?"
"204987124-0-21504";"Let me get you out of those ropes."
"204987124-0-21506";"What about Aphren's Hold itself?"
"204987124-0-21507";"What's so special about the king's sword?"
"204987124-0-21508";"What about Aphren's Hold itself?"
"204987124-0-21509";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-21511";"You want me to kill <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-21514";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-21516";"You're married to a Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-21517";"What are you going to do while I rescue Deregor?"
"204987124-0-21518";"How did you get the key to Helane's quarters?"
"204987124-0-21519";"What are you going to do while I rescue Deregor?"
"204987124-0-21520";"What are you going to do while I rescue Deregor?"
"204987124-0-21521";"What runestone?"
"204987124-0-21522";"A mage asked me to bring the pieces here."
"204987124-0-21523";"Can I trust you to return it?"
"204987124-0-21524";"Restore the sword and then give it back."
"204987124-0-21525";"Why did you shatter it?"
"204987124-0-21526";"Why does it feel wrong?"
"204987124-0-21527";"Why does it feel wrong?"
"204987124-0-21528";"How would you do that?"
"204987124-0-21529";"Princess Mira? I saw her spirit in the ruins."
"204987124-0-21530";"Princess Mira? I saw her spirit in the ruins."
"204987124-0-21531";"You wanted to make amends?"
"204987124-0-21532";"Hold still."
"204987124-0-21536";"I could do that for you."
"204987124-0-21537";"What brought you to Malabal Tor?"
"204987124-0-21538";"You're married to a Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-21539";"What is the runestone?"
"204987124-0-21541";"You're married to a Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-21542";"Yes, he's free."
"204987124-0-21543";"What kind of poison did you use on Helane?"
"204987124-0-21544";"You're just going to leave Helane to die?"
"204987124-0-21545";"What kind of poison did you use on Helane?"
"204987124-0-21546";"What kind of poison did you use on Helane?"
"204987124-0-21548";"Won't they kill you if you try to take it?"
"204987124-0-21551";"I'll do my part."
"204987124-0-21556";"Here. Take it."
"204987124-0-21560";"Yes. Here it is."
"204987124-0-21561";"Mauloch?"
"204987124-0-21562";"Your daughter gave everything to bring an end to this. Don't let her sacrifice be in vain."
"204987124-0-21564";"<<1>> tried to save her."
"204987124-0-21566";"A curse?"
"204987124-0-21567";"She asked me to make you stop this bloodshed."
"204987124-0-21568";"How about getting me off this island?"
"204987124-0-21570";"How about getting me off this island?"
"204987124-0-21572";"Help Captain Kaleen and I pull off her heist."
"204987124-0-21574";"Help Captain Kaleen and I pull off her heist."
"204987124-0-21576";"[Lie] Sorry. Haven't seen him."
"204987124-0-21579";"You owe me for freeing you, and Captain Kaleen needs your help."
"204987124-0-21581";"You owe me a favor."
"204987124-0-21583";"You owe me a favor."
"204987124-0-21585";"You owe me for freeing you, and Captain Kaleen needs your help."
"204987124-0-21588";"Did your father beat you?"
"204987124-0-21589";"Did you ever see your mother smoking skooma?"
"204987124-0-21590";"So he never hit you?"
"204987124-0-21591";"Could Rilyn have killed your parents?"
"204987124-0-21592";"Did you ever see your mother smoking skooma?"
"204987124-0-21593";"So you don't think Rilyn did it?"
"204987124-0-21594";"But it might help us figure out who might have wanted them dead."
"204987124-0-21595";"Is it possible your mother was using skooma?"
"204987124-0-21597";"Did he ever hit you?"
"204987124-0-21598";"Skooma dealers can be very dangerous to those who can't pay."
"204987124-0-21599";"Do you think Rilyn would hurt your parents?"
"204987124-0-21600";"Is it possible your mother was using skooma?"
"204987124-0-21603";"What was so special about Betnikh?"
"204987124-0-21604";"Why haven't you dealt with the zombies yourself?"
"204987124-0-21605";"Why is there a Breton graveyard on Betnikh? Isn't this an Orc island?"
"204987124-0-21606";"Why is there a Breton graveyard on Betnikh? Isn't this an Orc island?"
"204987124-0-21608";"How do I charge the staff?"
"204987124-0-21609";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-21610";"The Seamount clan killed you?"
"204987124-0-21612";"Are you the guardian of this graveyard?"
"204987124-0-21613";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-21614";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-21615";"Where do I go?"
"204987124-0-21618";"Ogres have attacked Gavaudon?"
"204987124-0-21619";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-21620";"Who else could activate the wards?"
"204987124-0-21621";"I'll figure out what's going on down here."
"204987124-0-21622";"What do the wards do again?"
"204987124-0-21623";"What do the wards do again?"
"204987124-0-21625";"No. I'm trying to figure out what these Maulborn are doing."
"204987124-0-21627";"No. I'm trying to figure out what these Maulborn are doing."
"204987124-0-21631";"Thanks, Lerisa."
"204987124-0-21633";"Thanks!"
"204987124-0-21635";"I do, <<1>> gave me this crystal. I will see if I can break the seal on the door."
"204987124-0-21636";"Lead on."
"204987124-0-21638";"Where can we find the runestone?"
"204987124-0-21641";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-21642";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-21643";"Let's find it and destroy it."
"204987124-0-21644";"Thank you. I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-21645";"How will this totem spirit help me?"
"204987124-0-21646";"Ogres have attacked Gavaudon?"
"204987124-0-21647";"Ogres have attacked Gavaudon?"
"204987124-0-21648";"Where are you going to be?"
"204987124-0-21650";"Yes, but Abbot Durak believes there's another Omen in Gavaudon."
"204987124-0-21651";"Should I seek him out then?"
"204987124-0-21652";"Abbot Durak asked me to join him in Gavaudon."
"204987124-0-21653";"Abbot Durak asked me to join him there."
"204987124-0-21655";"Then I will go speak with him."
"204987124-0-21657";"King Emeric said you just returned from Gavaudon."
"204987124-0-21658";"Why would anyone care about the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-21659";"You want me to believe they forced you to help them?"
"204987124-0-21660";"You want me to believe they forced you to help them?"
"204987124-0-21661";"The small army that got away, is it still on the loose?"
"204987124-0-21662";"Strange in what way?"
"204987124-0-21663";"King Emeric said you just returned from Gavaudon."
"204987124-0-21664";"Was anyone in Gavaudon having nightmares?"
"204987124-0-21666";"Will do, Khali."
"204987124-0-21667";"Who are the Drublog?"
"204987124-0-21668";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-21669";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-21670";"Was anyone there having nightmares?"
"204987124-0-21672";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-21673";"Which of us should stay behind?"
"204987124-0-21675";"What kind of help?"
"204987124-0-21676";"<<1>> is fine. Let's get you out of here."
"204987124-0-21677";"What's in the lucky pouch?"
"204987124-0-21678";"I'll find your things."
"204987124-0-21680";"Can you think of anything that will help me?"
"204987124-0-21681";"Do you think you'll ever stop fighting?"
"204987124-0-21683";"Why aren't you with the council and Merric?"
"204987124-0-21685";"Yes, here, take it."
"204987124-0-21690";"Being out here helps?"
"204987124-0-21695";"Can you tell me more about the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-21697";"What do you know about the worshipers of Mauloch?"
"204987124-0-21698";"Why did the chief object?"
"204987124-0-21699";"You know, I could deal with this faster if you had a few gizzards to spare."
"204987124-0-21701";"How do I make the concoction after I collect the gizzards?"
"204987124-0-21702";"How do I make the concoction after I collect the gizzards?"
"204987124-0-21703";"No signs of combat?"
"204987124-0-21704";"Are you sure that's the best plan?"
"204987124-0-21705";"After everything is on fire, what then?"
"204987124-0-21707";"[Lie] I really didn't find it."
"204987124-0-21709";"Why are the Fists of Thalmor in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-21710";"Why aren't you with the council and Merric?"
"204987124-0-21711";"Who are the Silvenar and the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-21712";"Why are the Fists of Thalmor in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-21713";"Dignitaries? Who are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-21714";"What should I do when I get across?"
"204987124-0-21717";"I'll head to the village."
"204987124-0-21719";"But didn't you come to fight ogres?"
"204987124-0-21720";"What are you saying?"
"204987124-0-21721";"What's the gaping mouth you saw? Some kind of beast?"
"204987124-0-21724";"What's in that lucky pouch?"
"204987124-0-21725";"Then tell me what you're planning."
"204987124-0-21726";"The Ayleids here are from the Meridian city, right?"
"204987124-0-21727";"I'm glad I found your things."
"204987124-0-21728";"Feluz said the moon-sugar candy would fetch a good profit."
"204987124-0-21729";"Where is he?"
"204987124-0-21731";"And they came here, to Mzeneldt."
"204987124-0-21732";"The Steel Shrikes destroyed your ship."
"204987124-0-21735";"It's the least I could do."
"204987124-0-21737";"I did what I thought best."
"204987124-0-21738";"So the crystal is here?"
"204987124-0-21741";"Where are you heading now?"
"204987124-0-21743";"I'm glad too. Thank you."
"204987124-0-21746";"Why those names?"
"204987124-0-21749";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-21750";"Is that why you attacked Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-21753";"Redguard army?"
"204987124-0-21754";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-21757";"But you said you're neutral."
"204987124-0-21759";"And you're just camping out here?"
"204987124-0-21765";"Why are they here?"
"204987124-0-21766";"How did she win Hosni's affections?"
"204987124-0-21767";"That's it? Just defeat them?"
"204987124-0-21769";"That's unfortunate."
"204987124-0-21770";"I'm ready. Let's get this over with."
"204987124-0-21771";"You've bet against them before?"
"204987124-0-21775";"Where should I meet you?"
"204987124-0-21776";"Where do you think these crystals are?"
"204987124-0-21778";"Are you actually studying those Goblins?"
"204987124-0-21781";"Perhaps we should go to Bergama, as well? His journal mentioned he stopped there."
"204987124-0-21782";"Perhaps we should go to Bergama, as well? His journal mentioned he stopped there."
"204987124-0-21783";"There are other troubles to deal with."
"204987124-0-21784";"Do you have any relics that could help me?"
"204987124-0-21785";"Create the portal. I'll follow soon."
"204987124-0-21787";"I can handle that."
"204987124-0-21788";"She's alive. I sent her back to the village."
"204987124-0-21789";"How should we proceed?"
"204987124-0-21790";"Follow me."
"204987124-0-21791";"How will we find her?"
"204987124-0-21793";"I'll search the camp. Meet back here?"
"204987124-0-21795";"I'm with you."
"204987124-0-21800";"Why do they call it the Grave?"
"204987124-0-21801";"What's your idea?"
"204987124-0-21802";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-21803";"You said Jakarn is a prince?"
"204987124-0-21806";"Can't he escape?"
"204987124-0-21807";"You said Jakarn is a prince?"
"204987124-0-21809";"Where do I fit in?"
"204987124-0-21811";"You don't want to be spotted in town?"
"204987124-0-21813";"What kind of danger? Why can't we talk about this danger?"
"204987124-0-21815";"Let's go!"
"204987124-0-21817";"Thanks, Neramo."
"204987124-0-21823";"How can we stop him?"
"204987124-0-21826";"It is certainly strong."
"204987124-0-21828";"Prince Irnskar hopes you will attend the war council."
"204987124-0-21830";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-21831";"Perhaps I can help."
"204987124-0-21832";"What can you tell me about the Dwemer?"
"204987124-0-21834";"Any idea where I should return this totem to the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-21835";"Was the Green Lady an archer?"
"204987124-0-21836";"What happened to Ulthorn?"
"204987124-0-21837";"Ulthorn must've been angry."
"204987124-0-21838";"What feat was that?"
"204987124-0-21840";"How did the first Green Lady die?"
"204987124-0-21842";"I'll check it out. Where is it?"
"204987124-0-21843";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-21844";"I'll check it out. Where is it?"
"204987124-0-21845";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-21847";"Orsinium? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-21849";"Thanks for your advice, Lambur."
"204987124-0-21850";"How would it save lives?"
"204987124-0-21852";"I have to think about this."
"204987124-0-21853";"<Keep the relic.>"
"204987124-0-21854";"How do I know what to give them?"
"204987124-0-21855";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-21858";"Was that the same potion I just drank?"
"204987124-0-21859";"What brought you here?"
"204987124-0-21860";"How did that thunderbug get rid of the energy?"
"204987124-0-21862";"Why are you making these potions?"
"204987124-0-21863";"This isn't normal?"
"204987124-0-21865";"<Read the inscription.>"
"204987124-0-21866";"<Turn to the last page.>"
"204987124-0-21867";"What do you brew here?"
"204987124-0-21868";"This was the best Boast in years?"
"204987124-0-21870";"I hope this helps ease your sorrow."
"204987124-0-21873";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-21874";"After all the trouble I went through to get them, surely you can tell me."
"204987124-0-21877";"Who are the Colovians?"
"204987124-0-21878";"So, how do we get out of here?"
"204987124-0-21879";"I'm not leaving without you."
"204987124-0-21880";"So, if I win the Crown, the Guards have to obey me?"
"204987124-0-21882";"I'll defeat the Lava Queen and win this thing."
"204987124-0-21883";"Then we'll retrieve them."
"204987124-0-21885";"We'll face them together. Come on."
"204987124-0-21887";"Who's left to recruit?"
"204987124-0-21889";"Tell me about Crafty Lerisa."
"204987124-0-21890";"Sailing logs? Why?"
"204987124-0-21891";"<Take the potion and continue reading.>"
"204987124-0-21892";"How does that make us rich?"
"204987124-0-21893";"The king's agreed to pay you for them?"
"204987124-0-21894";"How do I do it?"
"204987124-0-21895";"I'll be back soon."
"204987124-0-21896";"And then?"
"204987124-0-21900";"I see."
"204987124-0-21901";"I found the Index. Richard Dusant's spirit told me to bring it to you."
"204987124-0-21902";"Thanks, Lerisa. I'd love your help."
"204987124-0-21904";"Sounds great, Jakarn."
"204987124-0-21905";"<Use the key and turn to page 26.>"
"204987124-0-21907";"He knew you would appreciate the Dresan Index."
"204987124-0-21909";"They're using you to keep Lyris shackled to Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-21913";"What's inside the lockbox?"
"204987124-0-21914";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-21916";"What's your idea?"
"204987124-0-21918";"I'll take it. Thanks Neramo."
"204987124-0-21919";"The spirit belongs to a woman who died here after your father mistreated her."
"204987124-0-21920";"Maybe you should just leave her in peace."
"204987124-0-21921";"And how do you suggest I do that?"
"204987124-0-21923";"His sailing logs? Really?"
"204987124-0-21924";"So it's over."
"204987124-0-21926";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-21928";"Any chance you might ""lose"" one of those servant outfits?"
"204987124-0-21929";"Take this for your trouble."
"204987124-0-21930";"Why eight rats?"
"204987124-0-21932";"Fine. Take the money."
"204987124-0-21933";"Is it really necessary for me to find the Ghost Snake?"
"204987124-0-21935";"Yeeeeeeep."
"204987124-0-21938";"Why shouldn't the curse be broken?"
"204987124-0-21939";"Estel."
"204987124-0-21940";"Why should I visit the mine near the cathedral?"
"204987124-0-21941";"A necklace."
"204987124-0-21942";"Why should I visit the mine near the cathedral?"
"204987124-0-21943";"Estel."
"204987124-0-21944";"Prince Irnskar hopes you will attend his war council."
"204987124-0-21946";"I hope you will help the prince."
"204987124-0-21948";"The wolves attacked me."
"204987124-0-21950";"Yes, Prince Irnskar hopes you will attend the council."
"204987124-0-21951";"It is certainly strong."
"204987124-0-21952";"Why tell me this if your master won't help me?"
"204987124-0-21954";"Fear."
"204987124-0-21955";"There's hoarvor all over, and you're napping?"
"204987124-0-21960";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-21962";"Does he ever leave his post?"
"204987124-0-21964";"And someone answered your prayers?"
"204987124-0-21965";"The Baelbornes are different now."
"204987124-0-21967";"What happens if I remove the ward?"
"204987124-0-21972";"What can we do about it?"
"204987124-0-21974";"Suit up. I'll wait."
"204987124-0-21977";"What can we do about it?"
"204987124-0-21979";"Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-21984";"I'll wait."
"204987124-0-21986";"Why send me to stop the necromancers?"
"204987124-0-21988";"That looks like the man I met in Daggerfall."
"204987124-0-21989";"The contract was broken. This has to be Claudie's son."
"204987124-0-21990";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-21991";"You mentioned payment for services rendered?"
"204987124-0-21994";"Cataclysmic how?"
"204987124-0-21995";"All right. Who could have changed the wards?"
"204987124-0-21996";"Can't you use your magic to break through the wards?"
"204987124-0-21998";"How can I help stop the Hound?"
"204987124-0-21999";"How do you know this?"
"204987124-0-22003";"What did Rosalind do before she died?"
"204987124-0-22004";"Why do I need something of Rosalind's?"
"204987124-0-22010";"I'll take you to Endarwe."
"204987124-0-22011";"Endarwe told me your remains were those of an Ayleid warlord."
"204987124-0-22016";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22017";"Who's the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-22018";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22019";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22020";"Who's the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-22021";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22022";"What are the city's other defenses?"
"204987124-0-22023";"What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-22025";"Consider it done."
"204987124-0-22028";"The Sload? What are they?"
"204987124-0-22029";"What is the Festival of Defiance?"
"204987124-0-22030";"What is the Festival of Defiance?"
"204987124-0-22031";"I have some questions."
"204987124-0-22032";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-22033";"I'll find them. Now get to safety."
"204987124-0-22035";"Fine. Let's go."
"204987124-0-22037";"Help Captain Kaleen with the heist she's planning."
"204987124-0-22039";"I'm looking for a way off this island."
"204987124-0-22044";"Is Guy LeBlanc your leader?"
"204987124-0-22045";"Things may be settling down in Camlorn now. Faolchu was defeated."
"204987124-0-22046";"Is Guy LeBlanc your leader?"
"204987124-0-22048";"What can you tell me about them, then?"
"204987124-0-22049";"Let's move."
"204987124-0-22051";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-22052";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-22053";"What do you know of the wyresses?"
"204987124-0-22054";"Why didn't you ask the Lion Guard for help?"
"204987124-0-22055";"Have the spriggans ever done anything like this before?"
"204987124-0-22056";"Tell me."
"204987124-0-22057";"I'll learn whatever I can from them."
"204987124-0-22063";"You mentioned other villagers."
"204987124-0-22064";"What strange vines?"
"204987124-0-22065";"Daedra? Where?"
"204987124-0-22069";"Tell me about the Wyrd Tree."
"204987124-0-22070";"So you want to check out the farm?"
"204987124-0-22071";"Where do you want me?"
"204987124-0-22072";"I'll need to protect you, then?"
"204987124-0-22074";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-22076";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-22079";"All right. Get out of here."
"204987124-0-22081";"How do I get in?"
"204987124-0-22083";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-22084";"There was a mutiny?"
"204987124-0-22085";"What can you tell me about this ship?"
"204987124-0-22086";"But you stopped them?"
"204987124-0-22087";"I will talk to him."
"204987124-0-22088";"I will talk to him."
"204987124-0-22089";"You work for Captain Kaleen?"
"204987124-0-22090";"How did you meet her?"
"204987124-0-22091";"And you tried to steal it?"
"204987124-0-22092";"So you work for her now?"
"204987124-0-22093";"So you joined her crew?"
"204987124-0-22095";"All right. Get out of here."
"204987124-0-22096";"What vines?"
"204987124-0-22099";"Who are you and why are you here?"
"204987124-0-22101";"Roku said you'd help. She trusts me. Can you?"
"204987124-0-22102";"All right. Get out of here."
"204987124-0-22116";"There must be a way to find out where they're keeping him."
"204987124-0-22117";"You killed your previous crew?"
"204987124-0-22118";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-22119";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-22120";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-22123";"What happened to your old crew?"
"204987124-0-22124";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22125";"What happened to your old crew?"
"204987124-0-22126";"Captain Kaleen is your apprentice?"
"204987124-0-22135";"I'm ready. Take me to the arena."
"204987124-0-22136";"But how can the Maulborn avoid the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-22137";"Yes. Come with me."
"204987124-0-22138";"Brimstone Crown?"
"204987124-0-22140";"Just you and Kaleen stopped the mutineers?"
"204987124-0-22141";"Where is Kaleen?"
"204987124-0-22142";"What caused the mutiny?"
"204987124-0-22143";"Where is the rest of your crew?"
"204987124-0-22145";"No. Mathias sent me to help you."
"204987124-0-22146";"It sounds like you feel sorry for Mother Murk."
"204987124-0-22147";"I hope this puts an end to the danger facing the refugees."
"204987124-0-22149";"What are the spirit creatures around Ouze?"
"204987124-0-22157";"Do you miss it?"
"204987124-0-22162";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-22164";"Why are you making these potions?"
"204987124-0-22165";"Why are you making these potions?"
"204987124-0-22167";"What do you do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-22183";"You're not the only survivor. Head to the mill. The villagers are gathering there."
"204987124-0-22185";"The surviving villagers are gathering in the mill. You should join them."
"204987124-0-22189";"Why are you here, Aniel?"
"204987124-0-22191";"There are different groups here?"
"204987124-0-22192";"What's down here?"
"204987124-0-22193";"Who else could activate the wards?"
"204987124-0-22195";"So what should I do?"
"204987124-0-22198";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-22200";"Very well, I'll talk to Glooredel."
"204987124-0-22206";"What do I do with the admixture?"
"204987124-0-22208";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-22210";"Why would the Maulborn ask you about Daedric magic?"
"204987124-0-22216";"Do you know what the Maulborn were doing down there?"
"204987124-0-22217";"Even before they smell your breath?"
"204987124-0-22218";"Hard to think with all that weight pressing on your brains?"
"204987124-0-22219";"What's your reason?"
"204987124-0-22220";"It's a sacred relic?"
"204987124-0-22232";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-22235";"How did you fall so low?"
"204987124-0-22238";"She didn't kill you?"
"204987124-0-22242";"But what can I do that you can't?"
"204987124-0-22243";"How do I get the blessings of the other gods?"
"204987124-0-22245";"What's your reason?"
"204987124-0-22257";"What do you mean, they come true?"
"204987124-0-22258";"Who are the spinners?"
"204987124-0-22259";"Who are the spinners?"
"204987124-0-22261";"Before I do anything, I have a few questions about this place."
"204987124-0-22263";"I rescued some of the villagers from the Colovians as I went."
"204987124-0-22264";"What did they take?"
"204987124-0-22265";"I'll light the flame, then."
"204987124-0-22266";"Is everything ready?"
"204987124-0-22267";"Is everything ready in here?"
"204987124-0-22268";"I'll light the flame, then."
"204987124-0-22270";"If you're injured, I can come with you."
"204987124-0-22271";"A ghost in a tomb led me to it."
"204987124-0-22272";"<<1>> is alive, but there's something you should know."
"204987124-0-22273";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-22277";"Tell me about Elanduya."
"204987124-0-22278";"I think you must be mistaken. I'm not with the Ra Gada."
"204987124-0-22279";"Tell me about Elanduya."
"204987124-0-22280";"Wirande, that's an unusual name."
"204987124-0-22281";"Wirande, that's an unusual name."
"204987124-0-22282";"You only named three children. Who was the fourth?"
"204987124-0-22285";"I'm not even a Redguard."
"204987124-0-22287";"Take it, then."
"204987124-0-22289";"Where does the trail lead?"
"204987124-0-22290";"Where does the trail lead?"
"204987124-0-22291";"Are you hurt? Looks like this was quite a fight."
"204987124-0-22292";"How do we turn poison into something funny?"
"204987124-0-22293";"So I get the poison and use it on the stranglers. Then what?"
"204987124-0-22294";"I'll get the barrel and the poison, then!"
"204987124-0-22295";"What am I going to do with a barrel?"
"204987124-0-22297";"Who are the Houndsmen?"
"204987124-0-22298";"I'd like to know more about the search party."
"204987124-0-22300";"I'd like to know more about the search party."
"204987124-0-22301";"I freed General Godrun, didn't I?"
"204987124-0-22302";"What have you done to the king?"
"204987124-0-22303";"I don't believe you."
"204987124-0-22306";"What did they do?"
"204987124-0-22307";"Where to next?"
"204987124-0-22309";"What did he do then?"
"204987124-0-22311";"No. She now targets High King Emeric."
"204987124-0-22312";"How did you get a Dwemer construct as a pet?"
"204987124-0-22313";"Who is Telenger, again?"
"204987124-0-22314";"Who is Telenger, again?"
"204987124-0-22316";"Will you give us assistance in fighting her then?"
"204987124-0-22317";"How do I defeat Galthis?"
"204987124-0-22318";"Thank you. I will."
"204987124-0-22319";"Why would invaders unload supplies in Velyn Harbor?"
"204987124-0-22326";"I'll save him again if I have to."
"204987124-0-22328";"We'll see about that."
"204987124-0-22337";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-22338";"Did I offend you in some way?"
"204987124-0-22339";"Who did he hire?"
"204987124-0-22340";"You're in a Goblin camp. Acting like a Goblin."
"204987124-0-22343";"So you'll head back to town?"
"204987124-0-22345";"You're having some problems, right? Can I help?"
"204987124-0-22347";"What now?"
"204987124-0-22348";"I've decided who I'd like to help."
"204987124-0-22349";"I've decided who I'd like to help."
"204987124-0-22350";"I've decided who I'd like to help."
"204987124-0-22351";"What's he doing out here?"
"204987124-0-22352";"Why don't we just warn the town?"
"204987124-0-22353";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22355";"What now?"
"204987124-0-22356";"Who were the Falinesti?"
"204987124-0-22359";"The assassin was Verrik, but he worked for someone named Angof."
"204987124-0-22360";"With all this talk of war, is this really a good time for a party?"
"204987124-0-22361";"You look like a cinch to win the wrestling contest."
"204987124-0-22362";"They wanted to create chaos by assassinating you."
"204987124-0-22364";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-22365";"What is the Merethic Society?"
"204987124-0-22366";"What are you doing with that body on the floor?"
"204987124-0-22367";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-22368";"What can you tell me about Wizard Benele?"
"204987124-0-22369";"Who's the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-22370";"Who is the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22371";"All right. I'll go find the Silvenar."
"204987124-0-22372";"What's in the chow?"
"204987124-0-22373";"You couldn't get a job or something?"
"204987124-0-22374";"Why can't you run a frog?"
"204987124-0-22375";"What do I do once I have a frog?"
"204987124-0-22377";"Why can't you run a frog?"
"204987124-0-22378";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-22379";"I'll look around."
"204987124-0-22380";"What happens if I overdo it?"
"204987124-0-22381";"Why can't you run a frog?"
"204987124-0-22382";"There's trouble in other places?"
"204987124-0-22383";"What happens to Camlorn now?"
"204987124-0-22384";"<Examine the frog.>"
"204987124-0-22386";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-22387";"You're just going to leave?"
"204987124-0-22388";"I don't think so, Darien. You're not my type."
"204987124-0-22393";"What does a thane do?"
"204987124-0-22394";"What happened to the palace?"
"204987124-0-22395";"Yes. You are free."
"204987124-0-22398";"I'd like to observe the ritual."
"204987124-0-22399";"What sort of relics do you collect?"
"204987124-0-22400";"What is the Merethic Society?"
"204987124-0-22401";"So how does this help us learn about Faolchu?"
"204987124-0-22402";"Why have you waited to do this?"
"204987124-0-22403";"Nendaer?"
"204987124-0-22404";"I'm sure Zenithar appreciates it."
"204987124-0-22406";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-22407";"Why didn't you stop the Sea Drakes?"
"204987124-0-22409";"Perhaps Zenithar is making your crops fail."
"204987124-0-22410";"If Zenithar shuns Cropsford, you might be to blame."
"204987124-0-22412";"Why don't you rescue her?"
"204987124-0-22413";"Why don't you rescue her?"
"204987124-0-22414";"Who's Shamal?"
"204987124-0-22416";"What'll you do if I go after the king?"
"204987124-0-22418";"I'll take it to the shrine."
"204987124-0-22420";"How do I solve the puzzles?"
"204987124-0-22421";"Captain Lerisa owes me a favor."
"204987124-0-22422";"I might be interested in buying your monkey."
"204987124-0-22423";"Deal."
"204987124-0-22424";"Deal."
"204987124-0-22425";"Deal."
"204987124-0-22426";"And the others?"
"204987124-0-22427";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-22428";"How do I solve the puzzles?"
"204987124-0-22429";"Is there any other way to bring down the barrier?"
"204987124-0-22430";"Tell me about the spinners."
"204987124-0-22435";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22436";"Who are my targets?"
"204987124-0-22437";"I'm just glad you're safe now."
"204987124-0-22438";"Stay here. I'll get the plant sap for you."
"204987124-0-22439";"Even if I don't kill you, keep this up and you'll be dead soon. Go find a new life."
"204987124-0-22440";"How do I know he'll find anything?"
"204987124-0-22445";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-22446";"Good to hear."
"204987124-0-22447";"Good to hear."
"204987124-0-22448";"Fine, I'll follow."
"204987124-0-22450";"You're looking for a stolen gem that might not exist?"
"204987124-0-22452";"You don't sound like King Emeric."
"204987124-0-22453";"I'm not going to let you do that."
"204987124-0-22455";"Have you been having nightmares?"
"204987124-0-22458";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-22459";"What potential?"
"204987124-0-22462";"You seem very frustrated."
"204987124-0-22463";"Can I go inside and take a look?"
"204987124-0-22465";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-22466";"What part do I play in this?"
"204987124-0-22469";"I get it. Lead on."
"204987124-0-22470";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-22471";"Who are the spinners?"
"204987124-0-22473";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-22474";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-22476";"How did they know Gwaering would become the Green Lady?"
"204987124-0-22477";"That must have been a sight to see."
"204987124-0-22479";"Ascension to what?"
"204987124-0-22481";"Thanks for the tour."
"204987124-0-22483";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-22484";"What can we do?"
"204987124-0-22485";"I'm looking for a good blade."
"204987124-0-22488";"How do I distract her?"
"204987124-0-22489";"I understand. Where's the audience hall?"
"204987124-0-22490";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22493";"What if I'm looking for someplace to study lore?"
"204987124-0-22494";"The Artificer?"
"204987124-0-22495";"What if I'm looking for someplace to study lore?"
"204987124-0-22496";"I'm looking for someplace where I can be alone."
"204987124-0-22497";"Where to next?"
"204987124-0-22500";"Is this the first attempt on your life?"
"204987124-0-22502";"How did you gain the throne?"
"204987124-0-22506";"Any leads on Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-22507";"Your Majesty, would you mind telling me something about yourself?"
"204987124-0-22508";"Your Majesty, would you mind telling me something about yourself?"
"204987124-0-22509";"Your Majesty, would you mind telling me something about yourself?"
"204987124-0-22510";"Where's Crafty Lerisa?"
"204987124-0-22511";"What do you know of the Veiled Heritance, Your Majesty?"
"204987124-0-22512";"What do you know of the Veiled Heritance, Your Majesty?"
"204987124-0-22513";"You think we can save the world?"
"204987124-0-22514";"Where's Crafty Lerisa?"
"204987124-0-22516";"Is that where you met Razum-dar?"
"204987124-0-22517";"What do you know of the Veiled Heritance, Your Majesty?"
"204987124-0-22524";"I'll take this. Qawi, did Shazeem lose anything else?"
"204987124-0-22526";"I'm sorry, Kalari. Mathal is dead. The illusion ritual killed him."
"204987124-0-22527";"I found this letter from Rakhad to Mathal, threatening your life."
"204987124-0-22528";"I found this letter from Rakhad to Mathal, threatening your life."
"204987124-0-22531";"You want me to get rid of them?"
"204987124-0-22532";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-22539";"It turned out a group of skooma dealers had moved in below his well. I took care of them."
"204987124-0-22540";"He was right, bandits had moved into a cave near his farm. They're not a problem anymore."
"204987124-0-22541";"He was, and I killed him. He won't be a problem any longer, Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-22543";"Do you remember what happened to you?"
"204987124-0-22545";"At least you have your belongings."
"204987124-0-22549";"I'll see you there, then."
"204987124-0-22550";"I'm ready. Let's begin."
"204987124-0-22552";"All right, then!"
"204987124-0-22554";"So what do you think happened to the Falinesti?"
"204987124-0-22555";"What will become of the Arbordawn Cultists?"
"204987124-0-22557";"I think you know too. So I say Baron Sorick tripped and these folks are just helping him. All right?"
"204987124-0-22560";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-22561";"What brought the Fists of Thalmor?"
"204987124-0-22563";"What have you done to the king?"
"204987124-0-22564";"I don't believe you."
"204987124-0-22566";"Survey team?"
"204987124-0-22567";"The Hound?"
"204987124-0-22568";"Where are the others?"
"204987124-0-22569";"You mentioned the Hound?"
"204987124-0-22576";"<<1>> asked me to find you."
"204987124-0-22577";"How was that?"
"204987124-0-22579";"I'll be back soon with <<Ac:1>>."
"204987124-0-22580";"<<1>> asked me to find you."
"204987124-0-22581";"<<1>> asked me to find you."
"204987124-0-22582";"But something is worrying you."
"204987124-0-22584";"Who else is missing?"
"204987124-0-22585";"Who was Aiden Direnni?"
"204987124-0-22586";"What exactly have you heard?"
"204987124-0-22588";"Where did you put what?"
"204987124-0-22592";"Do you think he's still alive?"
"204987124-0-22593";"What brought you here?"
"204987124-0-22594";"I'll keep an eye out for her."
"204987124-0-22595";"Who was Aiden Direnni?"
"204987124-0-22596";"Who was Mansel Sesnit?"
"204987124-0-22597";"Who was Aiden Direnni?"
"204987124-0-22598";"Who was Aiden Direnni?"
"204987124-0-22599";"But you were Breton, not Mer. Why fight against them?"
"204987124-0-22600";"How do I return to the present?"
"204987124-0-22601";"Tell me about your beloved."
"204987124-0-22602";"Where should we start searching?"
"204987124-0-22603";"Any idea what attacked you?"
"204987124-0-22608";"I have some questions."
"204987124-0-22610";"Why did you join the Bloodthorn cult?"
"204987124-0-22611";"Why did you join the Bloodthorn cult?"
"204987124-0-22612";"What will you do if I help you?"
"204987124-0-22620";"Alana? I need to be the one to strike down Faolchu."
"204987124-0-22621";"I found Nanwen where you said the warlord was."
"204987124-0-22622";"And the captain died waiting for the new couple."
"204987124-0-22623";"New? What happened to the old ones?"
"204987124-0-22624";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-22625";"Do you know this area well?"
"204987124-0-22626";"Is it always like this?"
"204987124-0-22627";"What was that about arrows?"
"204987124-0-22629";"Do you have a problem with High Elves?"
"204987124-0-22630";"Do you know this area well?"
"204987124-0-22631";"What did you think of Finoriell?"
"204987124-0-22633";"Why did you join the Fists of Thalmor?"
"204987124-0-22634";"Do you think the civilians can repel this invasion?"
"204987124-0-22635";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22636";"Who is the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-22637";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-22638";"And you're the Green Lady."
"204987124-0-22639";"Who is the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-22640";"Do you perform rituals before taking on your titles?"
"204987124-0-22641";"Is the Queen well?"
"204987124-0-22642";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-22643";"What do the Eyes do?"
"204987124-0-22644";"Why would I be suited for this group?"
"204987124-0-22645";"What do the Eyes do?"
"204987124-0-22647";"There's no way to get you out of there?"
"204987124-0-22648";"How do I get to the circlet?"
"204987124-0-22649";"Why is this all so critical? Is this thing that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-22651";"Who are the Supernal Dreamers?"
"204987124-0-22652";"What about Grimfield? That's an ominous name."
"204987124-0-22653";"What can you tell me about Moriseli?"
"204987124-0-22654";"What can you tell me about Moriseli?"
"204987124-0-22657";"Your kin?"
"204987124-0-22658";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-22660";"Why are you changing the spinners' story?"
"204987124-0-22661";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22662";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-22665";"Can the Worm Cult enslave you again?"
"204987124-0-22669";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-22672";"Were all these blades made here?"
"204987124-0-22673";"All right."
"204987124-0-22676";"Why are you interested in me?"
"204987124-0-22677";"Yes, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-22678";"Yes, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-22679";"You're being too hard on yourself, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-22680";"Why would the Worm Cult be here?"
"204987124-0-22681";"Isn't the Green Lady one person?"
"204987124-0-22682";"I'm not sure what you're talking about."
"204987124-0-22684";"Lead on."
"204987124-0-22685";"The Maormer killed you while you were looking for relics, then?"
"204987124-0-22686";"That sounds totally reasonable."
"204987124-0-22687";"How?"
"204987124-0-22689";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-22690";"Why shouldn't the curse be broken?"
"204987124-0-22691";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-22692";"Where are we?"
"204987124-0-22696";"Our family?"
"204987124-0-22698";"But why Crosswych of all places?"
"204987124-0-22699";"But why Crosswych of all places?"
"204987124-0-22700";"Where will you go next?"
"204987124-0-22704";"That was me. Who are you?"
"204987124-0-22706";"Where are you traveling next?"
"204987124-0-22707";"Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-22708";"How do I get to him?"
"204987124-0-22710";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-22713";"By yourself?"
"204987124-0-22714";"Do you think the threat is over?"
"204987124-0-22715";"Do you think the threat is over?"
"204987124-0-22719";"The Arbordawn cultists?"
"204987124-0-22720";"What's that supposed to mean?"
"204987124-0-22722";"Done my part?"
"204987124-0-22723";"<<AC:1>> is safe. The Hound is defeated."
"204987124-0-22726";"What do you mean they're lost?"
"204987124-0-22727";"Isn't the treethane of the city the Silvenar himself?"
"204987124-0-22728";"Explain what you want me to do again."
"204987124-0-22733";"What did the Houndsmen do to the treethane?"
"204987124-0-22734";"What did the Houndsmen do to the treethane?"
"204987124-0-22735";"What's going to happen in Silvenar next?"
"204987124-0-22736";"Tell me what magic your husband summons, unless you're ready to die."
"204987124-0-22738";"Tell me how to stop King Renwic, unless you want to die."
"204987124-0-22744";"What can we do?"
"204987124-0-22748";"Why would the Worm Cult be here?"
"204987124-0-22749";"I'll get your sugar leaves."
"204987124-0-22750";"One of the reasons?"
"204987124-0-22751";"You seem eager to find the Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-22753";"You won't continue the contract against the Daedra?"
"204987124-0-22754";"What happened since last we spoke?"
"204987124-0-22755";"This is the Daggers' first job?"
"204987124-0-22757";"They're all dead, Milk Eyes. I destroyed the lab."
"204987124-0-22758";"I'll help Ezzag next."
"204987124-0-22759";"Thanks, I will."
"204987124-0-22762";"I'll put this on his pallet."
"204987124-0-22763";"How can I force them apart?"
"204987124-0-22764";"You came to see the king?"
"204987124-0-22765";"What are we going to do?"
"204987124-0-22767";"I'll smash the tables and burn the lab."
"204987124-0-22768";"Why do they call it the Grave?"
"204987124-0-22770";"If you apologize, you can find out."
"204987124-0-22773";"Rotmeth's used in wedding ceremonies?"
"204987124-0-22774";"Yes, the whole village was mad. If I hadn't saved her terrible things would have happened."
"204987124-0-22776";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-22777";"Any idea who's in charge of these bandits?"
"204987124-0-22779";"Which councilors should I talk to?"
"204987124-0-22780";"What did Rosalind do before she died?"
"204987124-0-22781";"What did Rosalind do before she died?"
"204987124-0-22782";"They have a leader?"
"204987124-0-22783";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-22785";"Understood. Lead the way."
"204987124-0-22787";"I'll see you inside."
"204987124-0-22789";"In the end, the villagers let Dabienne go and locked the Constable in the stocks."
"204987124-0-22790";"The town was attacked by slavers."
"204987124-0-22791";"Not really. I got the ship's ledger which proved the crew weren't slavers."
"204987124-0-22793";"No, that was everything."
"204987124-0-22794";"You have met Dabienne, haven't you?"
"204987124-0-22796";"Why did you leave the main roads?"
"204987124-0-22797";"What legend?"
"204987124-0-22799";"Did you find it?"
"204987124-0-22800";"How can I stop them?"
"204987124-0-22802";"You pulled me out?"
"204987124-0-22803";"Who are the Houndsmen?"
"204987124-0-22804";"Who are the Houndsmen?"
"204987124-0-22805";"Who are the Houndsmen?"
"204987124-0-22807";"The spirits?"
"204987124-0-22809";"Whispers in our ears?"
"204987124-0-22812";"I'll help Ezzag next."
"204987124-0-22814";"I'll help Kalari next."
"204987124-0-22815";"I'll head back, then."
"204987124-0-22816";"What is her plan?"
"204987124-0-22817";"You could have spoken to Merric."
"204987124-0-22818";"This is the same artifact we saw in that vision?"
"204987124-0-22819";"Perhaps we should investigate."
"204987124-0-22821";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-22822";"I've decided what to do."
"204987124-0-22823";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-22824";"I've decided what to do."
"204987124-0-22825";"Don't worry, they won't bother you again."
"204987124-0-22828";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22830";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22831";"I'll help Kalari next."
"204987124-0-22832";"I'll head back, then."
"204987124-0-22833";"Why did you suspect them?"
"204987124-0-22834";"What do you propose we do?"
"204987124-0-22840";"What about that commander she mentioned?"
"204987124-0-22841";"Where is this safe harbor?"
"204987124-0-22842";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-22845";"I'll come at once."
"204987124-0-22846";"Where is this safe harbor?"
"204987124-0-22848";"I'll find you there."
"204987124-0-22849";"Where is this safe harbor?"
"204987124-0-22851";"I'll find you there."
"204987124-0-22852";"What are these Daggers you keep mentioning?"
"204987124-0-22854";"What kind of research are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-22868";"And what do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-22870";"I am ready."
"204987124-0-22877";"Here's some gold for your journey."
"204987124-0-22878";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-22880";"Is the site in good health?"
"204987124-0-22881";"Do you know why the other cultists have gone mad?"
"204987124-0-22883";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-22885";"I'll take the gem."
"204987124-0-22886";"Give me the sword."
"204987124-0-22892";"I hear your Goblin food is delicious. Can I have some?"
"204987124-0-22896";"At least we're not assaulting a city this time."
"204987124-0-22899";"Is there anything else I can do for you?"
"204987124-0-22903";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22905";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22906";"I'll help Ezzag next."
"204987124-0-22907";"I'm heading back to her next."
"204987124-0-22908";"What now?"
"204987124-0-22909";"Do you need anything else?"
"204987124-0-22912";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22914";"I'll help Milk Eyes next."
"204987124-0-22915";"I'll help Ezzag next."
"204987124-0-22916";"I'll speak to her."
"204987124-0-22917";"I'll meet you at the summit."
"204987124-0-22920";"What can you tell me about the Mane?"
"204987124-0-22921";"At least we're not assaulting a city this time."
"204987124-0-22922";"What do you think happened to him?"
"204987124-0-22923";"At least we're not assaulting a city this time."
"204987124-0-22924";"What can you tell me about the Mane?"
"204987124-0-22926";"Are all your traps set on the ground?"
"204987124-0-22927";"Give me the throwing snares. How many harpies do you need?"
"204987124-0-22929";"Your father can't control what he's about to summon. Help me stop him."
"204987124-0-22930";"How's that working out?"
"204987124-0-22934";"Any idea why they kidnapped you in the first place?"
"204987124-0-22935";"Any idea why they kidnapped you in the first place?"
"204987124-0-22936";"The Green Lady seems very important to Deepwoods."
"204987124-0-22937";"And nothing will happen to her before that?"
"204987124-0-22940";"No. Aldcroft is closer."
"204987124-0-22941";"Why didn't you stick to the main roads?"
"204987124-0-22942";"How?"
"204987124-0-22943";"How can Drusilla be stopped?"

"204987124-0-22991";"Why are you telling this to me?"
"204987124-0-22993";"What do you think Diel is up to?"
"204987124-0-22994";"What's the matter?"
"204987124-0-22995";"Gelvin has the fifth egg."
"204987124-0-22997";"Does he enter the field often?"
"204987124-0-22998";"Does he enter the field often?"
"204987124-0-22999";"What are you?"
"204987124-0-23000";"I won't let you do this."
"204987124-0-23001";"Trust me, I had no idea what I was getting into."

"204987124-0-23044";"Take me to him."
"204987124-0-23046";"He's also paying you enough to keep the Daggers together."
"204987124-0-23047";"But what happens if the Daggers don't get paid?"
"204987124-0-23048";"No matter what happens, you have to do the right thing and reveal Lord Diel's treachery."
"204987124-0-23049";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-23050";"You need to swallow your pride and do what's right for the Daggers. You need that gold."
"204987124-0-23066";"I'm sorry, I can't help you today."
"204987124-0-23069";"You are lucky. You don't look injured."

"204987124-0-23089";"We have evidence. There was no threat before you started it."
"204987124-0-23092";"Increase the Daggers payment and our lips are sealed."
"204987124-0-23094";"How do you feel, now?"
"204987124-0-23096";"Let's check it out."

"204987124-0-23109";"Can you send me back?"
"204987124-0-23110";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-23111";"Can you send me back?"
"204987124-0-23114";"Any idea what I'll find in the ruins? I'd like to go in prepared."
"204987124-0-23115";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-23116";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-23122";"Killing Captain Marck isn't going to get you the money either."
"204987124-0-23124";"I'll do it. Just tell me where to find them."
"204987124-0-23126";"Tell me more about the gambler."
"204987124-0-23127";"Captain Marck? I met him in Alcaire."

"204987124-0-23132";"Why this island?"
"204987124-0-23134";"Then you should be able to clear things up with your boss now."
"204987124-0-23135";"Then you should be able to clear things up with your boss now."
"204987124-0-23139";"You really have no idea what the Bloodthorn cult intends?"
"204987124-0-23142";"Duke Sebastien will want to talk to you."
"204987124-0-23143";"On your guard."
"204987124-0-23145";"But what does a thane do?"
"204987124-0-23146";"Who was the challenger?"
"204987124-0-23147";"What do you do in Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-23148";"I will."

"204987124-0-23151";"Tell me about your wife."
"204987124-0-23152";"You seem to know a lot about werewolves."
"204987124-0-23155";"Who are the Daggers?"
"204987124-0-23156";"Why'd you decide to form your own group?"
"204987124-0-23157";"But their claws are sharp as razors …."
"204987124-0-23159";"How did the Daggers hook up with Lord Diel?"
"204987124-0-23160";"Who are the Daggers?"
"204987124-0-23161";"Did you ask about the job before you accepted it?"
"204987124-0-23162";"Who are the Daggers?"
"204987124-0-23170";"Sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-23173";"Are you really Queen Nurnhilde?"
"204987124-0-23174";"Very well, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-23177";"Or they could learn how this harpy threat really started."
"204987124-0-23179";"Actually, King Casimir and I are good friends."
"204987124-0-23181";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23183";"Why don't you just give it to Gelvin?"
"204987124-0-23188";"I found this bag of gems on Lord Diel's body."
"204987124-0-23189";"You earned those gems. And now the Daggers can stay together."
"204987124-0-23190";"You earned those gems. And now the Daggers can stay together."
"204987124-0-23198";"Fight!"
"204987124-0-23200";"I'm to help an Advisor Norion. Do you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-23201";"I'll give the evidence to the Captain when I see her."
"204987124-0-23203";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-23207";"Follow me."
"204987124-0-23208";"This way."
"204987124-0-23214";"Can you teach me smithing?"
"204987124-0-23215";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-23216";"How can that help us?"
"204987124-0-23217";"How can I find this agent?"
"204987124-0-23219";"I'll find something and return."

"204987124-0-23229";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-23230";"I need the blessing of Jode to save the Claw."
"204987124-0-23232";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-23233";"Actually, I need the blessing of Jone to save the Claw."
"204987124-0-23235";"I will, here, let me just …."
"204987124-0-23236";"Forgive me, my Lord, but I heard something that might be of interest to you."
"204987124-0-23237";"I haven't seen either of them."
"204987124-0-23238";"By the way, what are the terms of your bet?"
"204987124-0-23239";"The Imperial chancellor? What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-23240";"Someone has been asking the locals about a Redguard named Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-23241";"Do you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-23243";"Thank you, my Lord."
"204987124-0-23244";"I'm looking for Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-23245";"Then you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-23247";"What—?"

"204987124-0-23260";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23261";"You're obviously as observant as you are beautiful! Is there anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-23263";"I asked around. Everyone told me to talk to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-23264";"<Sample the antidote.>"

"204987124-0-23294";"Love."
"204987124-0-23298";"I'd prefer to just pay for it."
"204987124-0-23300";"Fire. It makes Faolchu vulnerable to other attacks."
"204987124-0-23301";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-23302";"I'm ready."

"204987124-0-23371";"All right, I'll take it."
"204987124-0-23372";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-23373";"Marius mentioned the poison came with a trash shipment?"
"204987124-0-23374";"Sorry to bear bad news."

"204987124-0-23391";"I have come for the blessings of Arkay."
"204987124-0-23395";"Your support will encourage the people."
"204987124-0-23397";"What did you summon?"
"204987124-0-23398";"You were going to take the throne before the Queen returned?"
"204987124-0-23399";"Why does the Queen have to do these rituals?"
"204987124-0-23400";"Is that another ceremonial duty?"
"204987124-0-23401";"Who are all these people here?"
"204987124-0-23402";"Because the spirits are angry?"
"204987124-0-23405";"Why do you have to perform the rituals?"
"204987124-0-23406";"So Norion's treachery is no surprise, then?"
"204987124-0-23407";"What will you do here, my Queen?"
"204987124-0-23408";"What will you do here, my Queen?"
"204987124-0-23409";"What will you do here, my Queen?"
"204987124-0-23410";"Why would Norion turn against you? And who is the Veiled Queen?"
"204987124-0-23411";"Why would Norion turn against you? And who is the Veiled Queen?"
"204987124-0-23414";"It doesn't sound like the mayor gave up."
"204987124-0-23415";"Can you come with me?"
"204987124-0-23416";"Why are there so many Orc dead here?"
"204987124-0-23417";"Why are there so many Orc dead here?"
"204987124-0-23418";"Isn't research a strange occupation for an Orc?"
"204987124-0-23422";"Why would they do this?"
"204987124-0-23423";"Are you worried about any of the other courtiers?"
"204987124-0-23424";"But they escaped with some captives?"
"204987124-0-23426";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-23427";"You and she aren't close, then?"
"204987124-0-23428";"How do we deal with the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-23429";"How do we deal with the Veiled Heritance?"
"204987124-0-23430";"The cultists seek an Ayleid relic that can raise an invincible army."
"204987124-0-23433";"Why were you gambling?"
"204987124-0-23434";"What's so important about this lute?"
"204987124-0-23442";"Do you know where the Moon Hallowed is?"
"204987124-0-23443";"I'm looking for the Moon-Hallowed. Do you know where she is?"
"204987124-0-23446";"And you think Lord Diel is up to something?"
"204987124-0-23448";"What if I keep the horn?"
"204987124-0-23449";"I'm sorry. Your son is dead. I found this journal near his body."
"204987124-0-23452";"I could take the relic back to Vulkhel Guard for you."
"204987124-0-23453";"I encountered your friend Beddi in Bewan, and—"
"204987124-0-23454";"After. She said you both cast a spell that's keeping her on Nirn."
"204987124-0-23455";"Actually, she's dead."
"204987124-0-23456";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-23459";"He said you went to collect them, but you never came back."
"204987124-0-23460";"Hurry!"
"204987124-0-23462";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-23464";"See you there."
"204987124-0-23466";"What can we do?"
"204987124-0-23467";"Should I put them back?"
"204987124-0-23469";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-23471";"The Stonefire cult attack?"
"204987124-0-23472";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-23473";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-23477";"The Fenlords?"
"204987124-0-23478";"What will you do if we find it?"
"204987124-0-23479";"What's in it for me?"
"204987124-0-23480";"Which guild?"
"204987124-0-23481";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23482";"What is the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-23483";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23484";"Stale?"
"204987124-0-23485";"The Order of the Claw?"
"204987124-0-23486";"Who are you people?"
"204987124-0-23487";"What is this relic?"
"204987124-0-23488";"Tell me more about your clan."
"204987124-0-23491";"She isn't sure about that."
"204987124-0-23492";"Not yet."
"204987124-0-23493";"What about Mekag?"
"204987124-0-23494";"May I have the stone?"
"204987124-0-23495";"What is the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-23496";"Do you think I can't handle myself? Give it to me and I'll get us through this."
"204987124-0-23498";"Why have you people come here?"
"204987124-0-23501";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-23502";"Not yet."
"204987124-0-23505";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-23506";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-23507";"What type of arrangement?"
"204987124-0-23508";"Tell me, now. Have you seen a Khajiit down here?"
"204987124-0-23510";"It's her life."
"204987124-0-23511";"What if she promised to return?"
"204987124-0-23514";"Then who?"
"204987124-0-23516";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-23519";"You're not coming with me?"
"204987124-0-23521";"I think she wants the clan's blessing."
"204987124-0-23523";"What should I tell her?"
"204987124-0-23525";"Your marriage is vital to your clan. There is honor in doing your duty."
"204987124-0-23526";"Not yet."
"204987124-0-23529";"I will, Esan."
"204987124-0-23530";"Totem?"
"204987124-0-23531";"What cult?"
"204987124-0-23533";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-23534";"No, I have some business to finish here first."
"204987124-0-23538";"I'll search for <<1>> and the others."
"204987124-0-23539";"Where should we look?"
"204987124-0-23541";"Where exactly is this mine?"
"204987124-0-23542";"Why did they attack?"
"204987124-0-23544";"Did they take anything?"
"204987124-0-23545";"I'll take care of them."
"204987124-0-23546";"Why did Rama want to challenge the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-23548";"I'm glad I could help."
"204987124-0-23549";"I'm glad I could help."
"204987124-0-23555";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-23556";"What was the Crown's purpose?"
"204987124-0-23557";"Where's the entrance to these catacombs?"
"204987124-0-23558";"Saervild asked me to collect the relics."
"204987124-0-23560";"You have to give him a chance. He's your son."
"204987124-0-23562";"I gave the relics to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-23563";"Where could Saervild take the relics?"
"204987124-0-23564";"I'll find something at the Dominion camp."
"204987124-0-23571";"No."
"204987124-0-23572";"Isn't this Stormy-Eyes' house?"
"204987124-0-23577";"This is Stormy-Eyes' house."
"204987124-0-23579";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-23582";"Run action list."
"204987124-0-23584";"He's trying to save an injured Argonian."
"204987124-0-23585";"I'm sorry, but Esan is dead. Bayya killed him."
"204987124-0-23586";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-23587";"What did you see?"
"204987124-0-23589";"Or maybe I could get a reward for telling the city guard you're a graverobber?"
"204987124-0-23590";"What bandits?"
"204987124-0-23591";"Any idea where the crypt she talked about might be?"
"204987124-0-23593";"[Leave Estate]"
"204987124-0-23600";"Do you like steak?"
"204987124-0-23601";"Is the goat stew tasty?"
"204987124-0-23602";"Is the goat stew tasty?"
"204987124-0-23603";"How does the ritual work?"
"204987124-0-23604";"Is the goat stew tasty?"
"204987124-0-23605";"Do you like steak?"
"204987124-0-23607";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23609";"Goat stew sounds fine."
"204987124-0-23611";"How can I kill the Omen if this is only a dream?"
"204987124-0-23614";"I'll go get some bear steaks."
"204987124-0-23615";"Unfortunately, we need that key."
"204987124-0-23616";"Are you trying to bargain your life for another?"
"204987124-0-23618";"I'll let you go after you tell me where the reagents are."
"204987124-0-23623";"You don't get along with Sholg?"
"204987124-0-23628";"You mentioned the clan's blessing. They won't give it to Lokra?"
"204987124-0-23633";"That seems harsh."
"204987124-0-23634";"Is Lokra your daughter?"
"204987124-0-23635";"Hunt-Wife Lurgush thinks you'll desert the clan."
"204987124-0-23636";"Have you considered just leaving?"
"204987124-0-23637";"I could speak to them for you."
"204987124-0-23638";"So you don't want to be a chief's wife?"
"204987124-0-23639";"Surely you brought something in case the ruins were haunted."
"204987124-0-23640";"Have you considered just leaving?"
"204987124-0-23641";"From what I've seen, they've got their own."
"204987124-0-23642";"Good luck in your travels, then."
"204987124-0-23643";"There's often trouble wherever one goes."
"204987124-0-23644";"I gave it to the ghost of the king's daughter."
"204987124-0-23645";"Where do I find this Redguard assassin?"
"204987124-0-23647";"I'll be back when she's dead."
"204987124-0-23650";"I must have blacked out."
"204987124-0-23651";"They told me it had something to do with the werewolves."
"204987124-0-23653";"Is anyone looking for them?"
"204987124-0-23655";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-23656";"Any place in particular?"
"204987124-0-23657";"The workers invited me to join their celebration."
"204987124-0-23659";"I'll talk to some of the survivors."
"204987124-0-23661";"That's an awful grim view."
"204987124-0-23662";"I understand."
"204987124-0-23665";"I'll find whoever did this."
"204987124-0-23666";"I'll find whoever did this."
"204987124-0-23667";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-23668";"Is that what happened to Asmalah's wife?"
"204987124-0-23669";"How can you be so calm about all this?"
"204987124-0-23671";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-23673";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-23674";"Can you tell me anything else?"
"204987124-0-23675";"The attackers were singing?"
"204987124-0-23676";"Who was screaming? The attackers or the workers?"
"204987124-0-23677";"So you didn't see anything unusual."
"204987124-0-23679";"[Take Pickaxe]"
"204987124-0-23681";"I'm working to figure that out."
"204987124-0-23682";"I will talk to them."
"204987124-0-23684";"Have you searched the cave?"
"204987124-0-23686";"I'll search the cave."
"204987124-0-23687";"What comes next?"
"204987124-0-23688";"All right. I'm sure I'll see you again soon."
"204987124-0-23691";"Good luck, Shazah."
"204987124-0-23693";"I'll find the Guildhall and close the portal."
"204987124-0-23695";"I'll meet you there, then."
"204987124-0-23697";"After you, Shazah."
"204987124-0-23698";"Are there other camps like Cragwallow?"
"204987124-0-23699";"Do you throw these celebrations often?"
"204987124-0-23700";"Where do I get vampire blood?"
"204987124-0-23701";"I need your help then."
"204987124-0-23702";"And what do we do after that?"
"204987124-0-23703";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-23704";"Thank you, Rid-Thar."
"204987124-0-23706";"Let's go, then."
"204987124-0-23708";"Until we meet again."
"204987124-0-23709";"Any idea who's in charge of these bandits?"
"204987124-0-23710";"Where is Bearclaw Mine?"
"204987124-0-23714";"You actually study Goblins?"
"204987124-0-23717";"Tell me about your brother."
"204987124-0-23718";"Tell me about your wife."
"204987124-0-23719";"Tell me about your wife."
"204987124-0-23722";"What's so special about these ruins?"
"204987124-0-23724";"Ruins can be dangerous. And so can the Dominion."
"204987124-0-23725";"Why are they interested in old ruins?"
"204987124-0-23727";"Did something happen out there?"
"204987124-0-23729";"If you say so."
"204987124-0-23731";"Maybe I could pay you for the fangs you already have?"
"204987124-0-23732";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-23733";"On second thought, maybe I'll pay you for your fangs."
"204987124-0-23734";"What do you think we should do?"
"204987124-0-23735";"How do I get in?"
"204987124-0-23737";"What kind of magic?"
"204987124-0-23738";"Do you know where the Worm Cult took the <<z:1>>?"
"204987124-0-23739";"That might be too dangerous. Perhaps you should drop out of the hunt."
"204987124-0-23740";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-23741";"Fine, then."
"204987124-0-23743";"Well, good hunting then."
"204987124-0-23744";"Fine, then."
"204987124-0-23745";"You do that."
"204987124-0-23746";"Where is this mine exactly?"
"204987124-0-23751";"Why are they here?"
"204987124-0-23753";"The lute should be destroyed."
"204987124-0-23754";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-23755";"What kind of relic?"
"204987124-0-23756";"How can I get inside?"
"204987124-0-23757";"How can I get inside?"
"204987124-0-23758";"What do I do once I have them?"
"204987124-0-23759";"Kill you? What cult?"
"204987124-0-23766";"I don't understand any of this."
"204987124-0-23767";"How did he do that?"
"204987124-0-23768";"Skorvild and his followers are eating the flesh of giants?"
"204987124-0-23770";"Someone here right now?"
"204987124-0-23771";"How do you like Cropsford?"
"204987124-0-23773";"Do you know Varana Scaeva?"
"204987124-0-23775";"He asked you as a friend, or an ally?"
"204987124-0-23776";"I'm to escort you to the Imperial Underground."
"204987124-0-23777";"Does Zenithar like pumpkins?"
"204987124-0-23778";"So why not return to it?"
"204987124-0-23780";"You're in charge of Murtag clan?"
"204987124-0-23781";"You sound a little resentful."
"204987124-0-23782";"Does Murtag clan live in Orsinium now?"
"204987124-0-23784";"Where do the Ironhand Ogres come from?"
"204987124-0-23785";"This is giant meat. He plans to use the meat to perform a ritual to make him stronger."
"204987124-0-23787";"What's your meeting in Dune about?"
"204987124-0-23793";"I'll go to the tree-minders' camp."
"204987124-0-23795";"They are fine looking instruments. Are they for sale?"
"204987124-0-23796";"They are fine looking instruments. Are they for sale?"
"204987124-0-23797";"You must really enjoy music."
"204987124-0-23798";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-23799";"Maybe Madria should marry whomever she wants?"
"204987124-0-23801";"Why?"
"204987124-0-23802";"Where is he?"
"204987124-0-23803";"And you? Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-23804";"And you? Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-23805";"I'll look for him at the arena, then."
"204987124-0-23806";"How can you make us stronger?"
"204987124-0-23807";"What happened to the wards?"
"204987124-0-23808";"Herma-Mora?"
"204987124-0-23811";"<Eat some of the meat.>"
"204987124-0-23813";"The vicecanons? Who are they?"
"204987124-0-23815";"Are you Saromir?"
"204987124-0-23816";"He did, and your service is almost complete. Herma-Mora simply asks that you sacrifice yourself."
"204987124-0-23817";"You're not a member of the faith, then?"
"204987124-0-23818";"You mentioned you take care of roots?"
"204987124-0-23819";"How do you maintain the roots?"
"204987124-0-23820";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23821";"And if I refuse to kill him?"
"204987124-0-23824";"This will be quick."
"204987124-0-23826";"You know him?"
"204987124-0-23827";"You seemed pleased I wasn't a pilgrim."
"204987124-0-23828";"You seemed pleased I wasn't a pilgrim."
"204987124-0-23831";"Where did she go?"
"204987124-0-23832";"All right. Tend to your wounds. I'll find her."
"204987124-0-23833";"Can I speak with the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-23841";"Can I petition him for an audience?"
"204987124-0-23842";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-23849";"I found orders from Pelidil indicating there was a large force."
"204987124-0-23851";"You think they're planning to attack Woodhearth?"
"204987124-0-23854";"What's your son's name?"
"204987124-0-23860";"Why did you betray me like that?"
"204987124-0-23861";"I guess that's what I'll do then."
"204987124-0-23863";"You don't think the Wilderking exists?"
"204987124-0-23864";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-23865";"What do you know about Stormhold?"
"204987124-0-23866";"Have you lived here long?"
"204987124-0-23867";"Are all the merchants so dishonest?"
"204987124-0-23868";"What did he do to you?"
"204987124-0-23869";"Why is the Mages Guild in an Ayleid ruin?"
"204987124-0-23870";"Are you new to the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-23871";"Are you new to the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-23872";"Why all the security?"
"204987124-0-23874";"I thought you said slavery was forbidden?"
"204987124-0-23875";"Tell me about the Pact."
"204987124-0-23876";"Tell me about the Pact."
"204987124-0-23877";"So Argonians used to be slaves?"
"204987124-0-23878";"Who's Sithis?"
"204987124-0-23879";"Can you tell me about the Shadowscales again?"
"204987124-0-23880";"Can you tell me about the Shadowscales again?"
"204987124-0-23881";"And you think you can get it clean?"
"204987124-0-23883";"You're sweeping dirt …."
"204987124-0-23884";"Why don't you take a break from sweeping?"
"204987124-0-23885";"Are you … all right?"
"204987124-0-23892";"This should buy you out of your contract."
"204987124-0-23902";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-23906";"[Shazah Holds the Dark Mane] Thank you for your sacrifice."
"204987124-0-23909";"So Shazah would become the Mane?"
"204987124-0-23912";"[Khali Holds the Dark Mane] Thank you for your sacrifice."
"204987124-0-23915";"Where is the Dominion keeping your friends?"
"204987124-0-23916";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-23919";"Where are the wardstones?"
"204987124-0-23920";"What's the plan then?"
"204987124-0-23921";"What are you and the general doing here?"
"204987124-0-23924";"What about the keystone?"
"204987124-0-23925";"What exactly is the keystone?"
"204987124-0-23928";"How do we re-bind them?"
"204987124-0-23929";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-23933";"Orthenir told me you could help bind the Daedra."
"204987124-0-23935";"I'm no mouse, Orc. Do you want to see my measure?"
"204987124-0-23939";"Maybe this will jog your memory?"
"204987124-0-23940";"If I find Thod for you, will you tell me what the King is meeting about?"
"204987124-0-23943";"A man was murdered. I'm trying to find his killer."
"204987124-0-23946";"Go. Quickly."
"204987124-0-23947";"Go, and be safe."
"204987124-0-23948";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-23952";"Can you tell me about the Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-23954";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-23955";"Can you tell me more about the Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-23956";"I'll speak to them. But don't go anywhere."
"204987124-0-23957";"Do you know where she was going?"
"204987124-0-23959";"Thanks for the help."
"204987124-0-23960";"Do you know where she was going?"
"204987124-0-23962";"<Examine the soldier's body.>"
"204987124-0-23965";"Why did you volunteer for this operation?"
"204987124-0-23967";"Are you the only one left?"
"204987124-0-23969";"Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-23970";"Pale-Heart said you can give me some help."
"204987124-0-23971";"How do you know so much about the keystones?"
"204987124-0-23972";"What do we need to do first?"
"204987124-0-23973";"I'll cut you loose."
"204987124-0-23975";"Let's do this."
"204987124-0-23978";"What happened to the keystone?"
"204987124-0-23980";"Do you need help?"
"204987124-0-23983";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-23984";"Any idea where I can find Jafelma?"
"204987124-0-23986";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-23987";"That's funny. Thulvald said that's exactly what you did."
"204987124-0-23988";"Sounds easy enough."
"204987124-0-23990";"What will you be doing during all of this?"
"204987124-0-23994";"Any pointers?"
"204987124-0-23995";"What should I do when the fire is lit?"
"204987124-0-23996";"You don't talk much, do you?"
"204987124-0-23997";"What happened out here?"
"204987124-0-23998";"Where can I find this spriggan matron?"
"204987124-0-23999";"Who has a prior claim to this land?"
"204987124-0-24001";"Perhaps you could help me."
"204987124-0-24003";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-24004";"Are you two… together now?"
"204987124-0-24006";"I see."
"204987124-0-24007";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-24011";"I'll watch your back."
"204987124-0-24013";"What's his plan?"
"204987124-0-24014";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-24015";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-24018";"I'll get them for you."
"204987124-0-24019";"What can you tell me about the relics?"
"204987124-0-24022";"You can tell skin-stealers by smell. Wouldn't you have noticed before?"
"204987124-0-24027";"When did your troll problem start?"
"204987124-0-24028";"What is the next trial?"
"204987124-0-24029";"When did your troll problem start?"
"204987124-0-24030";"Where did your clerk go?"
"204987124-0-24031";"How?"
"204987124-0-24035";"Who has a prior claim to this land?"
"204987124-0-24037";"What did he have to say?"
"204987124-0-24038";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-24040";"You seem concerned."
"204987124-0-24042";"No. I'm trying to find Guard Thod. He was with the Commander."
"204987124-0-24043";"The Commander and I had an arrangement."
"204987124-0-24044";"The treasures you're after. Are they valuable?"
"204987124-0-24045";"What are you talking about and who are the Stormcrags?"
"204987124-0-24046";"Can I ask you something else?"
"204987124-0-24047";"Got it. Let's go."
"204987124-0-24049";"So, that's it? Avoid dogs?"
"204987124-0-24050";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-24051";"I'll be careful. Let's go."
"204987124-0-24053";"See you inside."
"204987124-0-24055";"Tell me what you know of the Dominion's plans."
"204987124-0-24056";"What kind of favor?"
"204987124-0-24057";"Where is Captain Henaamo?"
"204987124-0-24061";"Where did the Withered Hand come from?"
"204987124-0-24062";"And they're behind the attack on the docks?"
"204987124-0-24064";"How did you get separated?"
"204987124-0-24065";"Why are all the vicecanons here?"
"204987124-0-24066";"Why are all the vicecanons here?"
"204987124-0-24067";"It was in my vision."
"204987124-0-24072";"I'll recover any Hist amber I find."
"204987124-0-24073";"Where did he go?"
"204987124-0-24074";"Agreed."
"204987124-0-24075";"Guard Hloenor mentioned she saw him with you."
"204987124-0-24076";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-24077";"Let's begin!"
"204987124-0-24078";"Ready when you are."
"204987124-0-24082";"You don't believe as they do?"
"204987124-0-24083";"I will if I can. Do you know a way?"
"204987124-0-24084";"Where are they conducting this ritual?"
"204987124-0-24087";"I will help however I can, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-24089";"Who is General Thoda?"
"204987124-0-24091";"Check Marla's house. That will confirm my story."
"204987124-0-24096";"Who are the Ash'abah?"
"204987124-0-24097";"Tall One?"
"204987124-0-24099";"Do they all look like you?"
"204987124-0-24100";"Why don't I look like the rest of you?"
"204987124-0-24101";"Are these Ferals dangerous?"
"204987124-0-24103";"He does have a chip on his shoulder."
"204987124-0-24104";"Should I just ignore him?"
"204987124-0-24105";"Stormfist spies. They've replaced Yjarnn and killed people, including Dark Elves."
"204987124-0-24107";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-24108";"Only Guard Hloenor. She's going to look into it."
"204987124-0-24110";"Noted. Let's go."
"204987124-0-24111";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-24112";"Sad? How so?"
"204987124-0-24114";"I didn't mean to offend you."
"204987124-0-24115";"Is your name really Thistlebreeches?"
"204987124-0-24117";"What can we do to stop them?"
"204987124-0-24118";"What are the Ansei Wards?"
"204987124-0-24119";"And the people still believe that today?"
"204987124-0-24120";"Will I be cursed for fighting them?"
"204987124-0-24122";"How did it happen?"
"204987124-0-24123";"Did the Alik'r ever face an undead threat before the Ash'abah?"
"204987124-0-24124";"Where are they now?"
"204987124-0-24125";"Returning the relics sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-24126";"Maybe I can help."
"204987124-0-24127";"Lord Vurlop doesn't want the Prince to know."
"204987124-0-24129";"What did the Prince do to anger the Argonians and Dark Elves?"
"204987124-0-24131";"Yes. They summoned undead to attack the docks."
"204987124-0-24132";"I'll tell her."
"204987124-0-24133";"Who are Uwafa and Alasan?"
"204987124-0-24135";"I'll let her know you're still alive."
"204987124-0-24136";"Just a moment, I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-24138";"The king said Azah has been investigating the Withered Hand."
"204987124-0-24140";"Where can I find the prince?"
"204987124-0-24141";"How did you know the sons though?"
"204987124-0-24144";"Best of luck, Kasan!"
"204987124-0-24147";"Something must have angered the giants."
"204987124-0-24149";"I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-24150";"It's worth a try. I'll go ask in the street now."
"204987124-0-24151";"I'll protect you."
"204987124-0-24153";"Here you are."
"204987124-0-24154";"What will we find?"
"204987124-0-24157";"I'll help your people if you agree to return to Prince Irnskar's meeting."
"204987124-0-24158";"I'll free your subjects."
"204987124-0-24159";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-24160";"I'll free your subjects."
"204987124-0-24161";"They don't seem to be doing a very good job."
"204987124-0-24165";"So where do all these undead come from?"
"204987124-0-24167";"So what happens if they steal the Ansei Wards?"
"204987124-0-24170";"Yes. I will ask the Mages Guild to help us."
"204987124-0-24174";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-24175";"A Hist key. He made it by fitting the three puzzle stones together."
"204987124-0-24176";"We need to wait for <<1>>. He'll be with us shortly."
"204987124-0-24181";"How can we stop Barvyn?"
"204987124-0-24182";"What are the Fangs of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-24184";"What's in the ruins?"
"204987124-0-24186";"What do do you want me to talk to them about?"
"204987124-0-24188";"That's how you're going to convince him to return to the meeting?"
"204987124-0-24190";"I need the keystone."
"204987124-0-24191";"I'll take a look around."
"204987124-0-24193";"I'll escort you to the tower."
"204987124-0-24194";"All right. I'll escort you."
"204987124-0-24196";"You've seen Ayleids at other ruins?"
"204987124-0-24198";"Maybe you just want to tell to someone."
"204987124-0-24200";"You think you can take King Jorunn's place?"
"204987124-0-24201";"You told them you were getting help?"
"204987124-0-24202";"How did you get here so fast?"
"204987124-0-24205";"Let's find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-24211";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-24212";"Do you still owe money to S'rashi?"
"204987124-0-24213";"We should tell the other vicecanons about this."
"204987124-0-24214";"I need to talk to <<1>> before I decide."
"204987124-0-24215";"We went through a lot to get these Fangs. Why are they so important?"
"204987124-0-24216";"Any suggesions?"
"204987124-0-24218";"How long have the Seamounts settled here?"
"204987124-0-24220";"Who is the Night Mother?"
"204987124-0-24221";"And she wants the Fangs?"
"204987124-0-24222";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-24228";"Here you are."
"204987124-0-24230";"I need to talk to <<1>> before I decide."
"204987124-0-24231";"Perhaps. What would I do at the altar?"
"204987124-0-24232";"What kind of favor?"
"204987124-0-24234";"Here, take them."
"204987124-0-24238";"Eaten?"
"204987124-0-24240";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-24241";"What can I do for you?"
"204987124-0-24242";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-24243";"Do you want me to give them to the Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-24245";"You offended the forest spirits?"
"204987124-0-24249";"Is there another way to stop the Dominion's plans?"
"204987124-0-24254";"All right. I'll free your friends if you help me stop the skin-stealers."
"204987124-0-24255";"Where are your friends being held?"
"204987124-0-24256";"Yes, I know. I'm asking how we can get past this door."
"204987124-0-24257";"How do we know how the altars should be aligned?"
"204987124-0-24258";"<<1>> said I could find the keystone in this temple."
"204987124-0-24260";"All right, I release you."
"204987124-0-24261";"You understand what you did wrong. You may pass on freely."
"204987124-0-24262";"Then claim your freedom and pass from this place."
"204987124-0-24263";"Okay. <Free Mereel>"
"204987124-0-24265";"You think the whispers are coming from a Daedra?"
"204987124-0-24266";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-24268";"Looks that way."
"204987124-0-24270";"Okay. <Free Faulor>"
"204987124-0-24271";"What about the others?"
"204987124-0-24274";"Okay. <Free At'avar>"
"204987124-0-24277";"I'll free you. <Free At'avar>"
"204987124-0-24281";"Why does your clan hide?"
"204987124-0-24282";"Why did the Ternions offer to aid the Skald-King?"
"204987124-0-24285";"We can't give up."
"204987124-0-24293";"I don't know, but we just need to keep you and the keystone away from the Dominion."
"204987124-0-24297";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-24299";"We gather power from the Atronachs? How?"
"204987124-0-24300";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-24302";"Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-24303";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-24305";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-24307";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-24308";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-24309";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-24310";"Is the Skald-King here?"
"204987124-0-24314";"Then send me instead."
"204987124-0-24315";"Why does it have to be this way? Why does the Dark Mane have to be contained?"
"204987124-0-24316";"Can't we just destroy him?"
"204987124-0-24317";"Tell me about the aspects of your gods."
"204987124-0-24320";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-24321";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-24322";"And where did the rieklings take the bard?"
"204987124-0-24325";"You would only be alienated from our common enemies."
"204987124-0-24326";"All right. How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-24327";"Who is this person you're referring to?"
"204987124-0-24329";"What happened to Saromir?"
"204987124-0-24330";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-24331";"Do you know where the Dwarves went, Sees-All-Colors?"
"204987124-0-24332";"How did he ""force"" you to become a murderer?"
"204987124-0-24333";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-24334";"Go on then, let's hear this plan."
"204987124-0-24335";"You think these skulls are the key to his power?"
"204987124-0-24336";"And good luck to you."
"204987124-0-24337";"Let's go, then."
"204987124-0-24339";"Why Hammerfell?"
"204987124-0-24340";"Do you know where the Dwarves went, Sees-All-Colors?"
"204987124-0-24341";"Fine. I'll kill Saromir."
"204987124-0-24344";"I'm real. I came here with the Argonian to save you."
"204987124-0-24345";"We need to get you out of here."
"204987124-0-24348";"Strangely?"
"204987124-0-24350";"You're taking me to see Hadran, then?"
"204987124-0-24351";"Lead on, then."
"204987124-0-24353";"You said you'd just returned to town. What were you doing?"
"204987124-0-24354";"Is he still alive?"
"204987124-0-24355";"Why would they attack you?"
"204987124-0-24357";"Can I pay his debt? Or just buy him from you?"
"204987124-0-24358";"Can you tell me more about this agreement?"
"204987124-0-24359";"Why did she leave?"
"204987124-0-24361";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-24362";"Aerana, I have some bad news. The Stormfists have killed most of the clan."
"204987124-0-24364";"The Stormfists may have wanted the Sigil."
"204987124-0-24365";"I have it here. Your mother asked me to find it."
"204987124-0-24366";"She betrayed the guild, Merric. She killed Jofnir."
"204987124-0-24367";"Well, what do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-24368";"Well, what do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-24369";"Will do."
"204987124-0-24374";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-24376";"How do we enter the Vault?"
"204987124-0-24379";"Has it always been like this?"
"204987124-0-24381";"What's different about them?"
"204987124-0-24383";"Will he want my help?"
"204987124-0-24386";"There was a crystal, and some kind of dark spirit hanging over him."
"204987124-0-24389";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-24390";"Who is Namira?"
"204987124-0-24391";"What do I do once I get there?"
"204987124-0-24392";"Who is Namira?"
"204987124-0-24394";"Do you know why they call this hole in the ground the Tower of Lies?"
"204987124-0-24395";"What's your role in the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-24398";"You mentioned someone named Skordo?"
"204987124-0-24400";"I have a few more questions."
"204987124-0-24401";"What about the Argonians who live here?"
"204987124-0-24402";"Have you been hiding anything else?"
"204987124-0-24403";"The people of Xal Ithix asked for my help."
"204987124-0-24404";"Destroying the skull will do what, exactly?"
"204987124-0-24406";"Very well."
"204987124-0-24407";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-24408";"I get to choose which type of guardian we build?"
"204987124-0-24409";"Where could Goblins hide in a place like the desert?"
"204987124-0-24411";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-24412";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-24413";"Why the urgency?"
"204987124-0-24414";"What do you think it is?"
"204987124-0-24415";"If they're long-gone, why the urgency?"
"204987124-0-24416";"Did you learn anything else from Doshia's journal?"
"204987124-0-24417";"How do we break this curse, once and for all?"
"204987124-0-24418";"Very well."
"204987124-0-24419";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-24422";"Treasures?"
"204987124-0-24423";"How so?"
"204987124-0-24424";"One of those ""foolish Hist-worshipers"" said this relic will affect your minions."
"204987124-0-24426";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-24428";"Where did they go?"
"204987124-0-24429";"I'll find her, Halindor. I'll go to Ezreba's house."
"204987124-0-24430";"Harpies? Hags? Anything else?"
"204987124-0-24431";"Why hasn't anyone caught on yet?"
"204987124-0-24433";"Did you learn anything from Doshia's journal?"
"204987124-0-24434";"Tell me about Betra."
"204987124-0-24435";"What do you recommend?"
"204987124-0-24437";"Did you learn anything from Doshia's journal?"
"204987124-0-24439";"Are you here to take part in the festivities?"
"204987124-0-24440";"I didn't catch your name."
"204987124-0-24456";"You mentioned roads."
"204987124-0-24461";"Then what should I do?"
"204987124-0-24462";"I stopped him, but the Dominion has something called the <<a:1>>."
"204987124-0-24464";"The High Elf <<1>> brought it to a place of power. I don't know where."
"204987124-0-24465";"People in hoods?"
"204987124-0-24466";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-24469";"I'll find her."
"204987124-0-24471";"How have you survived this long?"
"204987124-0-24472";"I'll bring the Light of Meridia to you."
"204987124-0-24473";"About the mine …."
"204987124-0-24475";"Then we'd better find them."
"204987124-0-24479";"What more can I do in Xal Ithix?"
"204987124-0-24480";"Any other suggestions?"
"204987124-0-24481";"Is there more I can do in Xal Ithix?"
"204987124-0-24482";"I will."
"204987124-0-24483";"Yes, Bowenas is safe. Did you see anyone? Did you see Ezreba?"
"204987124-0-24484";"Get out of here as soon as you can. I'm going after Ezreba."
"204987124-0-24489";"I'll deliver the potions and be right back."
"204987124-0-24496";"Who should I look for when I get up there?"
"204987124-0-24497";"I'm ready. Lead on."
"204987124-0-24498";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-24499";"What did Gwilir do to deserve that?"
"204987124-0-24501";"Any idea what causes the confusion?"
"204987124-0-24502";"I'll head up to the next level."
"204987124-0-24505";"Here. Enjoy."
"204987124-0-24506";"I'm really just here to ask about Tand."
"204987124-0-24508";"Fine. I'll play."
"204987124-0-24511";"If I'm going to help, I need to know the specifics."
"204987124-0-24512";"How did you escape from the guards?"
"204987124-0-24513";"What kind of ""wares"" are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-24517";"The <<A:1>>?"
"204987124-0-24519";"Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-24522";"Is he being cooperative?"
"204987124-0-24523";"Let's hear what he has to say."
"204987124-0-24528";"We'd better get started, then."
"204987124-0-24531";"He won at spikeball?"
"204987124-0-24534";"Will you join us in confronting her?"
"204987124-0-24537";"Plenty of shade here."
"204987124-0-24538";"What kind of ""wares"" are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-24539";"Give me an example."
"204987124-0-24541";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-24542";"Who do you think killed her?"
"204987124-0-24544";"Do you know where it comes from?"
"204987124-0-24550";"This is your husband?"
"204987124-0-24552";"Are you doing well?"
"204987124-0-24555";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-24557";"I'll deal with Ifriz. Will you help?"
"204987124-0-24561";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-24563";"What do you do in Windhelm?"
"204987124-0-24564";"Why would she do that?"
"204987124-0-24565";"What is the Mnemic Egg?"
"204987124-0-24568";"If you don't tell me what the Mnemic Egg is, you're putting all of our lives at risk."
"204987124-0-24569";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-24571";"Courage, endurance, and preservation. I understand."
"204987124-0-24572";"What's the next step?"
"204987124-0-24576";"What does this have to do with the Trial of Body?"
"204987124-0-24578";"Your duty is to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-24580";"I'll stop him from eating any more eggs."
"204987124-0-24585";"Calm yourself. If you strike him, you put every keeper at risk."
"204987124-0-24586";"<<1>> will arrive soon with reinforcements."
"204987124-0-24587";"I know a secret that will make your stews even better."
"204987124-0-24588";"Killing them? Killing who?"
"204987124-0-24589";"I'll stand with you."
"204987124-0-24590";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-24591";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-24592";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-24594";"You've got it. Just tell me where I can find <<1>> and I'll share it with you."
"204987124-0-24602";"Go then. The way is clear."
"204987124-0-24604";"The way is clear. Go on."
"204987124-0-24614";"You should get out of here, too."
"204987124-0-24618";"Can you give me any assistance in this fight?"
"204987124-0-24625";"So how did you defeat Suturah?"
"204987124-0-24626";"How do the Ansei Wards work?"
"204987124-0-24627";"How did you defeat them before?"
"204987124-0-24629";"What does Molag Bal do with the Hist sap?"
"204987124-0-24631";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-24632";"If you don't tell me what the Mnemic Egg is, you're putting all our lives at risk."
"204987124-0-24633";"And if something were to happen to it …?"
"204987124-0-24636";"What happens if I agree to support the warriors?"
"204987124-0-24637";"I'll save the eggs."
"204987124-0-24638";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-24641";"Yes. I'll go in as soon as she breaks the seal."
"204987124-0-24643";"How do I stop <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-24644";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-24646";"You can help, but I'm tying your hands."
"204987124-0-24647";"I've killed far bigger things than trolls."
"204987124-0-24648";"How can I help you then?"
"204987124-0-24650";"How can we move it?"
"204987124-0-24652";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-24654";"The Dominion possesses something called <<A:1>>."
"204987124-0-24657";"Tell me what happened to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-24661";"Tell me what happened to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-24663";"Tell me what happened to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-24664";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-24665";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-24667";"I can handle the Dominion."
"204987124-0-24674";"And what does Molag Bal get out of the deal?"
"204987124-0-24675";"I had a few more questions."
"204987124-0-24677";"What do you know of my mission?"
"204987124-0-24678";"What did <<1>> do with him?"
"204987124-0-24681";"How did your people wind up in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-24684";"That they are."
"204987124-0-24687";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-24688";"Sheogorath forced me to save duplicates of you, Vanus Galerion, and Shalidor."
"204987124-0-24689";"Is he alive?"
"204987124-0-24690";"Could that explain this strange mist?"
"204987124-0-24693";"He had me attacking visions of the alliances, even the leaders."
"204987124-0-24694";"Is the site in good health?"
"204987124-0-24695";"Is the site in good health?"
"204987124-0-24696";"This is the one you were hunting?"
"204987124-0-24698";"He?"
"204987124-0-24699";"Was Faenir among those that accepted the veiled one's offer?"
"204987124-0-24700";"Tell me how to put a stop to this magic."
"204987124-0-24701";"You're right. He's too dangerous. End it."
"204987124-0-24705";"Very well."
"204987124-0-24714";"That's right … why did you leave the ruin so quickly?"
"204987124-0-24715";"Can you tell me any more about the forge you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-24716";"You can help, but I'm tying your hands."
"204987124-0-24717";"I have one of the keystones."
"204987124-0-24718";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-24721";"How do we find the bow?"
"204987124-0-24724";"Can you remind me … you mentioned a crystal?"
"204987124-0-24725";"Can you tell me any more about this forge?"
"204987124-0-24726";"Really?"
"204987124-0-24727";"Where is the portal?"
"204987124-0-24728";"Side effect?"
"204987124-0-24731";"[Travel] I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-24732";"[Travel] I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-24736";"All right. I'll search the Nereid temple."
"204987124-0-24738";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-24739";"These instructions should explain."
"204987124-0-24740";"Maybe something is after him."
"204987124-0-24743";"Maybe he just needs more time."
"204987124-0-24746";"Why not drive them out of <<A:1>>?"
"204987124-0-24747";"The Dominion created poultices to harm the Hist."
"204987124-0-24750";"You were imprisoned last time, too. I helped you."
"204987124-0-24753";"Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-24754";"Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-24755";"Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-24762";"Why haven't you tried to escape?"
"204987124-0-24768";"Where is King Renwic?"
"204987124-0-24769";"How do we get to King Renwic?"
"204987124-0-24771";"Tell me how to reach Renwic, if you value your life."
"204987124-0-24774";"Tell me how to reach King Renwic, or more of you will die."
"204987124-0-24776";"What does this weapon do?"
"204987124-0-24779";"I thought the Guild was neutral in the war?"
"204987124-0-24781";"How did you learn about these books?"
"204987124-0-24787";"What will we do with King Renwic?"
"204987124-0-24789";"What if he doesn't surrender?"
"204987124-0-24792";"<Give Desh-Wazei the Amulet of Courage.>"
"204987124-0-24793";"Let me give you a different amulet."
"204987124-0-24795";"Let me give you a different amulet."
"204987124-0-24796";"<Give Ashgar the Amulet of Courage.>"
"204987124-0-24797";"<Give Teelawei the Amulet of Courage.>"
"204987124-0-24798";"Let me try again."
"204987124-0-24799";"Let me try again."
"204987124-0-24802";"Let me give you a different amulet."
"204987124-0-24803";"Let me give you a different amulet."
"204987124-0-24820";"Shalidor appeared right after I picked up that book. He said fire would show you the words."
"204987124-0-24825";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-24826";"Will you answer some questions now?"
"204987124-0-24828";"I don't understand. What are you saying?"
"204987124-0-24830";"You need to explain this, Rid-Thar."
"204987124-0-24832";"Have you been out there yourself?"
"204987124-0-24833";"Can you tell me more about this Dunmer visitor?"
"204987124-0-24834";"I'll take them as they come."
"204987124-0-24836";"Is he really a threat? He sounds like a joke."
"204987124-0-24838";"How will binding the Daedra help secure the grove?"
"204987124-0-24839";"I agree with the scholars. The Hist tree should be allowed to die."
"204987124-0-24840";"Have you been out there yourself?"
"204987124-0-24841";"I agree with the warriors. The Hist tree must survive."
"204987124-0-24842";"If that's what I need to do to convince you, I accept your challenge."
"204987124-0-24848";"If that's what I need to do to convince you, I accept your challenge."
"204987124-0-24852";"Where did she go?"
"204987124-0-24853";"Why have you returned?"
"204987124-0-24854";"Why have you returned?"
"204987124-0-24861";"How do we stop King Renwic?"
"204987124-0-24863";"How far should I go in my interrogations?"
"204987124-0-24864";"Remind me about the Code of Mauloch."
"204987124-0-24865";"If not?"
"204987124-0-24867";"Is there honor in killing unarmed prisoners?"
"204987124-0-24868";"Remind me about the Code of Mauloch."
"204987124-0-24870";"<<1>> expects you. You need to go, now."
"204987124-0-24871";"<Place the Gem of Courage.>"
"204987124-0-24872";"Except what?"
"204987124-0-24873";"Have you been out there yourself?"
"204987124-0-24874";"I'll look for the rest of your squad."

"204987124-0-24896";"Let me accompany you."
"204987124-0-24898";"If I see any, I'll bring <<1>> to your squad."
"204987124-0-24899";"Push through the pain. <<1>> needs you right away."
"204987124-0-24900";"I need to find the rest of your squad."
"204987124-0-24903";"I need to find the rest of your squad."
"204987124-0-24906";"If you want to save her life, tell me how to reach Renwic."
"204987124-0-24907";"What do you want of me?"
"204987124-0-24908";"What should I ask for?"
"204987124-0-24909";"What can we expect on the island?"
"204987124-0-24912";"Where is the fourth soul?"
"204987124-0-24922";"There's no time. <<1>> expects you immediately."
"204987124-0-24925";"I told <<1>> I'd find the rest of your squad."
"204987124-0-24927";"I told <<1>> I'd find the rest of your squad."
"204987124-0-24929";"What is the Heart of Valenwood?"
"204987124-0-24940";"Where can I find these mushrooms?"
"204987124-0-24941";"He could have information we need. Let me speak with him first."
"204987124-0-24942";"What is King Renwic planning?"
"204987124-0-24947";"Sorry? What?"
"204987124-0-24948";"A plantation?"
"204987124-0-24949";"They ""tend"" to?"
"204987124-0-24951";"You're not going to answer my question, then?"
"204987124-0-24952";"How did the last tome lead you to the Chateau?"
"204987124-0-24953";"What is King Renwic planning?"
"204987124-0-24957";"Valaste, talk to me. There's something wrong with you."
"204987124-0-24958";"Valaste, talk to me. There's something wrong with you."
"204987124-0-24960";"What is King Renwic planning?"
"204987124-0-24965";"I release you and your army from service. You may leave."
"204987124-0-24966";"No. It's better you rest now."
"204987124-0-24967";"Good. Then I'll count on your support."
"204987124-0-24968";"What is King Renwic planning?"
"204987124-0-24972";"Do you know where I can find the Fighters Guild captains?"
"204987124-0-24973";"Can you help me free the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-24974";"Do you know where the Fighters Guild captains are?"
"204987124-0-24975";"So you're the one behind all this?"
"204987124-0-24993";"What's the catch?"
"204987124-0-24994";"It looked like he was killed in some kind of ritual."
"204987124-0-24995";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-24996";"Lots of bones, candles, and snakes. Also, wooden posts."
"204987124-0-25001";"<Continue the examination.>"
"204987124-0-25002";"I'll warn them."
"204987124-0-25003";"So the maze will be dark, then?"
"204987124-0-25004";"He was murdered in some kind of ritual. His squad needs reinforcements."
"204987124-0-25005";"And the Aldmeri could actually threaten Alik'r?"
"204987124-0-25009";"Why do I have to activate the pillars?"
"204987124-0-25010";"What's inside the prison?"
"204987124-0-25011";"I'll see if they can find the <<z:1>> and patch the ship."
"204987124-0-25012";"I'll see if they can find the <<z:1>> and patch the ship."
"204987124-0-25015";"text"
"204987124-0-25017";"You don't have any say in the negotiations?"
"204987124-0-25019";"What purpose do you think the portals served?"
"204987124-0-25020";"Who are the Sea Vipers?"
"204987124-0-25021";"What is Blackheart Haven?"
"204987124-0-25024";"Why did you sign a treaty with the Maormer?"
"204987124-0-25025";"Where is this treaty?"
"204987124-0-25028";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-25029";"Is <<c:1>> your real name?"
"204987124-0-25030";"Who stole <<1>>'s copy of the treaty?"
"204987124-0-25032";"I'll tell him."
"204987124-0-25033";"Do you think having the treaty will help?"
"204987124-0-25035";"Can you take me there?"
"204987124-0-25037";"That sounds fair."
"204987124-0-25039";"Heirlooms?"
"204987124-0-25040";"Why do I have to activate the pillars?"
"204987124-0-25047";"I understand. Let's get started."
"204987124-0-25052";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-25053";"Uncle Leo likes rats. Got it."
"204987124-0-25054";"Yes, I know."
"204987124-0-25055";"I suppose?"
"204987124-0-25056";"You turned him into a Flesh Atronach and now he loves rats?"
"204987124-0-25057";"I'll find your notes and the tincture, but I have a few questions."
"204987124-0-25061";"What are they?"
"204987124-0-25062";"I'll destroy the horns."
"204987124-0-25063";"Shalidor, Valaste is not well."
"204987124-0-25065";"Will you be all right here?"
"204987124-0-25067";"Never realized what?"
"204987124-0-25068";"Will you be all right here?"
"204987124-0-25069";"What happened to the other mages?"
"204987124-0-25074";"We're looking for a man named <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25075";"Release <<1>> immediately."
"204987124-0-25076";"How could the Maormer have anything to do with the shipwreck?"
"204987124-0-25079";"What does the quartermaster want me to do?"
"204987124-0-25080";"How can I get the Prowler's sun-sighter back?"
"204987124-0-25081";"How could the Maormer have anything to do with the shipwreck?"
"204987124-0-25082";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-25085";"I didn't notice a scent."
"204987124-0-25087";"How could the Maormer have anything to do with the shipwreck?"
"204987124-0-25088";"Whose orders?"
"204987124-0-25091";"If Rilis is so dangerous, why free him?"
"204987124-0-25092";"Who are the Keepers?"
"204987124-0-25093";"Who is this High Kinlord Rilis?"
"204987124-0-25094";"Your assassin bought Daedric blood from the apothecary and used it to kill <<Ac:1>>."
"204987124-0-25096";"I'll go after him."
"204987124-0-25098";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-25099";"I'll try to convince <<c:1>>."
"204987124-0-25101";"I'll leave you to it, then. [<<1>> dies]"
"204987124-0-25103";"No, he didn't."
"204987124-0-25105";"Have you officially joined the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-25106";"<Take the bow.>"
"204987124-0-25108";"Let's face him."
"204987124-0-25109";"He fell in love?"
"204987124-0-25111";"Then what does your captain say?"
"204987124-0-25114";"What's a sun-sighter?"
"204987124-0-25115";"Who are the Sea Vipers?"
"204987124-0-25116";"All right, never mind."
"204987124-0-25117";"What can I do to help you?"
"204987124-0-25119";"And you're expecting the traitors to attempt an assassination?"
"204987124-0-25120";"How many guards are we taking?"
"204987124-0-25122";"Thank you. When do we leave?"
"204987124-0-25123";"Are you pirates?"
"204987124-0-25124";"Who is in charge of the Prowler?"
"204987124-0-25125";"Here's your stolen health."
"204987124-0-25129";"Are you pirates?"
"204987124-0-25134";"<<1>>."
"204987124-0-25135";"You should get to safety."
"204987124-0-25136";"What does <<1>> do to troublemakers?"
"204987124-0-25137";"You said that before. What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-25138";"You seemed nervous when you were talking about the next book."
"204987124-0-25142";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-25145";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-25146";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-25147";"I'll do what I can to protect <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25148";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-25149";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-25150";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-25151";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-25153";"You're bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-25154";"What is <<Ac:1>>, exactly?"
"204987124-0-25155";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-25156";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-25157";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-25158";"I can't let you do that."
"204987124-0-25160";"What does the boss do with drunks?"
"204987124-0-25161";"Free <<1>>, right now."
"204987124-0-25164";"Moon-sugar and salt."
"204987124-0-25165";"The left one."
"204987124-0-25169";"How is that possible?"
"204987124-0-25171";"Then what did you mean?"
"204987124-0-25173";"What weakness?"
"204987124-0-25174";"How do we restore <<1>>'s prison?"
"204987124-0-25175";"What does <<Ac:1>> do?"
"204987124-0-25176";"Thank you, Valaste."
"204987124-0-25177";"There's more to it than children's stories?"
"204987124-0-25179";"Do you know anything about where I'm going?"
"204987124-0-25180";"Where are you from?"
"204987124-0-25181";"Could you remind me about this Sanctuary you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-25182";"What's it like working with Shalidor?"
"204987124-0-25183";"What can you tell me about the book?"
"204987124-0-25184";"I don't know about this."
"204987124-0-25186";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-25187";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-25188";"We should hurry."
"204987124-0-25189";"I'll seal you in the tomb with <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25190";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-25191";"We should hurry."
"204987124-0-25193";"I need to hear <<1>>'s thoughts before making a decision."
"204987124-0-25195";"What kind of magic?"
"204987124-0-25196";"What does a Docent do?"
"204987124-0-25198";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-25199";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-25200";"You serve a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-25202";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-25203";"He's missing and his family asked me to find him."
"204987124-0-25204";"Anyone in particular I should speak to?"
"204987124-0-25207";"I can protect you. Just tell me where we're going."
"204987124-0-25213";"Maybe this will change your mind?"
"204987124-0-25218";"Some are injured, but I'm sure they'll help where they can."
"204987124-0-25219";"Where will this portal take me?"
"204987124-0-25220";"Can you tell me anything about this fork?"
"204987124-0-25222";"The Prowler needs a replacement <<z:1>>."
"204987124-0-25227";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-25228";"So the relic saved lives?"
"204987124-0-25230";"That's good to hear."
"204987124-0-25231";"So she's started her own crew?"
"204987124-0-25232";"You must understand why the relic had to be destroyed."
"204987124-0-25234";"It still doesn't justify using something so evil."
"204987124-0-25235";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-25237";"Where is the relic now?"
"204987124-0-25238";"Why are you mad at me?"
"204987124-0-25240";"You can't know that. What if the relic had swallowed their souls?"
"204987124-0-25241";"Are you happy here?"
"204987124-0-25243";"Aren't you fighting Elves, though?"
"204987124-0-25245";"You were exiled from your home?"
"204987124-0-25246";"Have you seen much battle?"
"204987124-0-25248";"What about you, Kasan? Why are you still here?"
"204987124-0-25250";"If you disagree with her decision, why are you still here?"
"204987124-0-25255";"Have you spoken with Kaleen at all since you left?"
"204987124-0-25257";"Maybe she genuinely wanted to help."
"204987124-0-25258";"I did what I thought was right at Carzog's Demise."
"204987124-0-25260";"Stealing?"
"204987124-0-25261";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-25263";"Did you get a contract, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-25265";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-25267";"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"204987124-0-25280";"What am I signing up for?"
"204987124-0-25282";"Merric, Aelif, and I traveled to Oblivion tracking Sees-All-Colors."
"204987124-0-25283";"If you insist."
"204987124-0-25287";"She confessed to the crime, but she convinced me her cause was just."
"204987124-0-25288";"Yes. We killed her, as the council ordered."
"204987124-0-25305";"So they're going to kill them?"
"204987124-0-25313";"What are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-25314";"What's Pelidil planning?"
"204987124-0-25316";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-25321";"How do we find her?"
"204987124-0-25322";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-25323";"What?"
"204987124-0-25338";"She is a priestess of Meridia. She sought only the destruction of the Mortuum Vivicus."
"204987124-0-25339";"[Sees-All-Colors Stays] She did what she felt she had to. Let her serve the Guild."
"204987124-0-25340";"She tried to kill us. She was a follower of Molag Bal. I slew her and destroyed the Vivicus."
"204987124-0-25341";"She tried to kill us. She was a follower of Molag Bal. I slew her and destroyed the Vivicus."
"204987124-0-25342";"As you say, Countess."
"204987124-0-25343";"What about Merric? He was innocent in all of this."
"204987124-0-25344";"How do we close the shadow rifts?"
"204987124-0-25347";"How long will I remain small?"
"204987124-0-25348";"I hope you know what you're doing."
"204987124-0-25351";"Who is <<c:1>>, again?"
"204987124-0-25353";"What do you know about the lamia?"
"204987124-0-25354";"Do you have any advice before you head to the city?"
"204987124-0-25357";"Why do you need me?"
"204987124-0-25359";"What about the Wood Elf and her people?"
"204987124-0-25360";"How can I change the minds of the Shadow Walkers?"
"204987124-0-25362";"What about the lamia and her people?"
"204987124-0-25363";"Why will this information set you free?"
"204987124-0-25364";"What do I get out of this again?"
"204987124-0-25365";"Who is her second in command?"
"204987124-0-25368";"I'll figure out just where to find him, Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-25370";"The antipodal what?"
"204987124-0-25375";"You're asking for a lot."
"204987124-0-25377";"Why are Maormer a problem for the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-25381";"I'll drink the potion now."
"204987124-0-25382";"I'll drink the potion now."
"204987124-0-25383";"I'll drink the potion now."
"204987124-0-25387";"All right. Tell me what else you want me to do."
"204987124-0-25388";"Is there a way to get the shards without killing the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-25389";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25396";"How can I prove myself?"
"204987124-0-25398";"I'm ready to spar."
"204987124-0-25399";"So she rescued me herself …. Who is she?"
"204987124-0-25400";"And who are you?"
"204987124-0-25401";"Did she rescue me?"
"204987124-0-25402";"Did she rescue me?"
"204987124-0-25404";"You don't care that you're burning your village?"
"204987124-0-25405";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-25409";"Help with what?"
"204987124-0-25411";"Yes. I'll find the switch."
"204987124-0-25412";"All right. I'll help you."
"204987124-0-25414";"What about the trees? Don't Wood Elves revere them?"
"204987124-0-25415";"I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-25416";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-25417";"How were they able to set up a camp on top of your village?"
"204987124-0-25419";"Can you tell me anything more about the Rangers?"
"204987124-0-25420";"I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-25421";"So does that mean you're gathering the tools?"
"204987124-0-25424";"Why would I do that?"
"204987124-0-25426";"I'll have to think about it."
"204987124-0-25427";"The plan is to burn the village? What about the villagers?"
"204987124-0-25428";"I'll check out the Morass."
"204987124-0-25432";"I'll head there right away."
"204987124-0-25434";"I'll head over to find them."
"204987124-0-25442";"Illness?"
"204987124-0-25444";"You're referring to Yokuda?"
"204987124-0-25445";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-25447";"You think that's possible?"
"204987124-0-25452";"Yes. Take them."
"204987124-0-25458";"Why do you think they'd help you?"
"204987124-0-25461";"Stibbons asked me to recover her tools."
"204987124-0-25462";"Why not just let Tamien get the tools?"
"204987124-0-25463";"I might as well hang on to all of them."
"204987124-0-25465";"I'll take the tools and go then. Thanks."
"204987124-0-25470";"So what will you do now?"
"204987124-0-25472";"Who is the Wild Witch?"
"204987124-0-25473";"Kill the prisoners. The skin-stealer fights without aid."
"204987124-0-25476";"Yes, free the prisoners."
"204987124-0-25479";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-25480";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-25483";"I proved that I'm the better combatant."
"204987124-0-25485";"Do I get the Swordmaster credentials?"
"204987124-0-25486";"Why are you so annoyed about the Colovians?"
"204987124-0-25488";"Tell me more about the Engine."
"204987124-0-25489";"Why not just let Tamien get the tools?"
"204987124-0-25490";"Then tell me."
"204987124-0-25491";"I have more questions."
"204987124-0-25492";"I've earned credentials for all three divisions."
"204987124-0-25495";"My name is <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25497";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-25498";"Sangur said you had a plan for defeating the Hollow."
"204987124-0-25499";"And the roots are all entwined below ground?"
"204987124-0-25500";"Why are you so ready to burn the village?"
"204987124-0-25501";"Odreth made it seem like it was about pride."
"204987124-0-25502";"How did that happen?"
"204987124-0-25503";"You grow your village?"
"204987124-0-25504";"What about a cure?"
"204987124-0-25505";"Why isn't it a consideration for you?"
"204987124-0-25506";"You grow your village?"
"204987124-0-25507";"I have the shards."
"204987124-0-25509";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-25511";"Are these Ferals dangerous?"
"204987124-0-25512";"How long have you held this position?"
"204987124-0-25513";"Who is <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-25514";"What is your opinion of the Aldmeri Dominion?"
"204987124-0-25515";"Is <<c:1>> your real name?"
"204987124-0-25523";"So destroying the crystals will unseal the portal?"
"204987124-0-25524";"Does she exist?"
"204987124-0-25525";"I'll handle the crystals."
"204987124-0-25527";"I found a note about a young Khajiit taken to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25528";"On second thought, I'm going to need another moment."
"204987124-0-25531";"I'm trying to help someone. Can you make a cure for vampirism?"
"204987124-0-25534";"Distracted? What do you mean by distracted?"
"204987124-0-25536";"That must be the spirit attempting to heal the roots."
"204987124-0-25538";"And the big ones?"
"204987124-0-25539";"Is the spirit in danger?"
"204987124-0-25540";"But how is it different from any other tree?"
"204987124-0-25541";"Why is the Great Tree so important?"
"204987124-0-25546";"I don't have much time. Help me so I can reunite her with her husband."
"204987124-0-25550";"The left one."
"204987124-0-25554";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-25555";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-25557";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-25558";"Place the crystal and insert the rods, got it. This will separate the two of you?"
"204987124-0-25559";"I'm supposed to get an update on how things are progressing?"
"204987124-0-25560";"Just drink this."
"204987124-0-25563";"So what happens to you?"
"204987124-0-25565";"Very good. I think you'll do nicely, Centurion."
"204987124-0-25566";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-25568";"All right. I'll get up there."
"204987124-0-25569";"How am I going to do that?"
"204987124-0-25571";"So I'll appear as Gavo, then. What about Gavo?"
"204987124-0-25572";"Ready."
"204987124-0-25573";"Sure."
"204987124-0-25582";"Will you show me how to enter the tower now?"
"204987124-0-25585";"And what will you do now?"
"204987124-0-25591";"Can I ask a few questions?"
"204987124-0-25593";"What do you know about the Prophet?"
"204987124-0-25594";"How will we do that?"
"204987124-0-25596";"Point the crystal at Gavo. Got it."
"204987124-0-25597";"Tell me about yourself, Sir Cadwell."
"204987124-0-25598";"You don't think there's a way to get home?"
"204987124-0-25599";"I'll bet on <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25602";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-25604";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-25605";"Where are you projecting this image from?"
"204987124-0-25607";"How do I set you free?"
"204987124-0-25609";"It doesn't. Kill him, if you must. [<<1>> dies]"
"204987124-0-25613";"Looks like you have some new crewmembers too?"
"204987124-0-25614";"Do you still owe money to S'rashi?"
"204987124-0-25615";"PC"
"204987124-0-25617";"What did he say?"
"204987124-0-25619";"Have you officially joined the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-25620";"Sure, why not?"
"204987124-0-25621";"Shouldn't these superstitions be put to rest?"
"204987124-0-25624";"What's the Aldmeri Dominion?"
"204987124-0-25625";"Did you encounter any Sea Vipers?"
"204987124-0-25626";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-25628";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-25629";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-25630";"Why was the fleet sailing to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25631";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-25635";"That didn't sound very convincing."
"204987124-0-25636";"All right. I'll kill lamias, burn their eggs, and defeat their champion."
"204987124-0-25638";"What do you mean, she scouted the cave?"
"204987124-0-25640";"Haven't necromancers threatened Alik'r before?"
"204987124-0-25641";"Cast out on the basis of superstition?"
"204987124-0-25642";"Has business been good?"
"204987124-0-25644";"Then why the unrest in the Crown community?"
"204987124-0-25645";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-25647";"You're going to retake the city?"
"204987124-0-25648";"Tell me what's going on here."
"204987124-0-25650";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-25652";"I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-25658";"I will."
"204987124-0-25662";"But I can only restore one of you?"
"204987124-0-25669";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-25672";"I took the lamia champion's head as a trophy and I've still got room for a few more."
"204987124-0-25673";"I'm going to convince them to leave and come with me."
"204987124-0-25675";"Fine. I'll play."
"204987124-0-25678";"So there's a good chance that I'm going to fail?"
"204987124-0-25680";"What kind of restrictions?"
"204987124-0-25681";"I'm up for it."
"204987124-0-25682";"What other way?"
"204987124-0-25683";"Tell me more about Vanus Galerion."
"204987124-0-25684";"How's that?"
"204987124-0-25686";"I see what you mean."
"204987124-0-25687";"That's good to hear."
"204987124-0-25689";"Thank you, Cariel."
"204987124-0-25690";"I understand your situation, but with all due respect, I think you have been tricked."
"204987124-0-25691";"My lord, even now Molag Bal actively works to destroy Nirn. There will be no Valenwood to return to."
"204987124-0-25692";"I never trust anyone who decorates Valenwood and the rest of Nirn with Daedric anchors."
"204987124-0-25693";"Lose the attitude and listen well. I've seen the anchors. They're destroying Nirn!"
"204987124-0-25696";"Maybe a song and dance would convince you? You have to trust me!"
"204987124-0-25699";"Open your eyes and stop being a fool. Molag Bal is destroying Nirn even as we speak."
"204987124-0-25702";"Why don't they just leave?"
"204987124-0-25707";"Let's see what we can do."
"204987124-0-25708";"So how does this work?"
"204987124-0-25710";"If you give it to me, I can use it to destroy this forge."
"204987124-0-25711";"And why are the lamia and Faraniel arguing?"
"204987124-0-25714";"This won't hurt you. If you give me the energy, it will help you."
"204987124-0-25715";"If you don't return the energy, I'll give you a terrible beating."
"204987124-0-25720";"Give me the energy or I'll rip it from you."
"204987124-0-25721";"Does gold have value in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-25726";"Me? I have to fulfill the duty of the Ash'abah?"
"204987124-0-25728";"I'll go look for him right away."
"204987124-0-25733";"Why were you disguised as a Scamp?"
"204987124-0-25735";"Let's go rescue the mages."
"204987124-0-25737";"All right, I'll help you kill <<1>>."
"204987124-0-25738";"Can you tell me anything about this place, or the relics?"
"204987124-0-25740";"Where do you think the source would be?"
"204987124-0-25742";"All right. I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-25747";"Take back your energy."
"204987124-0-25750";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-25752";"How did this grove get here?"
"204987124-0-25753";"What will restoring the wards do?"
"204987124-0-25754";"How did this grove get here?"
"204987124-0-25755";"What will restoring the wards do?"
"204987124-0-25756";"I thought you divided yourself so they couldn't do this to you?"
"204987124-0-25758";"What should I do now?"
"204987124-0-25759";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-25764";"I don't understand what they're doing to you."
"204987124-0-25768";"Look me in the eye, soldier. And say that again."
"204987124-0-25769";"That's right. Walk away."
"204987124-0-25771";"What about Merric? He was innocent in all of this."
"204987124-0-25776";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-25777";"Of course. I'm always ready for a fight."
"204987124-0-25778";"All right, I'm going."
"204987124-0-25780";"Here you go. She's the Dark Elf over there at the Pact lodging."
"204987124-0-25783";"I've actually been cooling a keg under the bridge behind the lodge."
"204987124-0-25785";"Be right back."
"204987124-0-25786";"Where is Vanus Galerion's body?"
"204987124-0-25787";"Daedra don't usually speak to mortals."
"204987124-0-25789";"Does this place make people do those sorts of things?"
"204987124-0-25790";"Daedra don't usually speak to mortals."
"204987124-0-25791";"Are you one of the prison wardens?"
"204987124-0-25792";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-25793";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-25794";"More stealth and manipulation?"
"204987124-0-25796";"Where is this shrine?"
"204987124-0-25804";"Did you hear anything else?"
"204987124-0-25811";"So you think that's where we'll find him?"
"204987124-0-25812";"I'm sure we will be victorious."
"204987124-0-25813";"I'll be right behind you, Cariel."
"204987124-0-25815";"How do we close the portal?"
"204987124-0-25816";"Do you have any idea how to find the sigil stone?"
"204987124-0-25819";"And how do I get into a camp full of Wood Elves without killing any of them?"
"204987124-0-25820";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-25822";"But you claim that it is."
"204987124-0-25824";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25826";"And now that it's missing?"
"204987124-0-25827";"Have you tried talking to them?"
"204987124-0-25829";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-25831";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25833";"All right. I'll come right away."
"204987124-0-25834";"What did you do to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25838";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25839";"Did you learn anything about <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-25841";"Why should I help you and not the lamia?"
"204987124-0-25845";"What does <<Ac:1>> do?"
"204987124-0-25846";"If he can't affect me, I should enter the tomb alone."
"204987124-0-25847";"Am I in danger of being ""worn?"""
"204987124-0-25849";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-25850";"Have you ever spoken with the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-25852";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-25853";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-25857";"Are there other Shadowed Path groups?"
"204987124-0-25858";"What's a lich?"
"204987124-0-25859";"Why would someone do that to himself?"
"204987124-0-25860";"Who are the Shadowed Path?"
"204987124-0-25862";"I can't just abandon him. I have to do something."
"204987124-0-25864";"What kind of problems are you having?"
"204987124-0-25866";"Why did the Clan Mother's assistant quit?"
"204987124-0-25869";"I'm getting us out of here. Meet me at this plane's Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-25870";"How are they powered?"
"204987124-0-25872";"We're leaving this place. Meet me at this plane's Moonhenge once the gateway's open."
"204987124-0-25874";"What's <<1>>'s problem?"
"204987124-0-25875";"Just point me in their direction."
"204987124-0-25876";"I'll speak to him at once."
"204987124-0-25877";"I'll speak to him at once."
"204987124-0-25878";"I'll speak to her at once."
"204987124-0-25879";"I'll help <<1>> with his rats."
"204987124-0-25880";"No. I'll strike him down. It's my duty."
"204987124-0-25883";"Meet me at this plane's Moonhenge, so we can leave."
"204987124-0-25884";"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."
"204987124-0-25886";"Very well."
"204987124-0-25888";"You're wounded.  Let me clear the way and we'll meet at this plane's Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-25890";"Nothing bad has happened to me so far."
"204987124-0-25893";"Your last assistant quit?"
"204987124-0-25894";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-25895";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-25896";"How do I become an Ash'abah?"
"204987124-0-25897";"Yes. I will join the tribe."
"204987124-0-25898";"What do you seek?"
"204987124-0-25899";"What's so special about this shrine?"
"204987124-0-25901";"Lost books? What lost books?"
"204987124-0-25902";"What do you mean, a spirit lied to you?"
"204987124-0-25903";"It is all right, brother. I accept my sentence."
"204987124-0-25906";"Is this shrine dedicated to Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-25907";"Is this shrine dedicated to Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-25908";"Did you create the visions I saw?"
"204987124-0-25909";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-25911";"You convinced me. Here, take the tomes."
"204987124-0-25912";"And the ""value"" you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-25913";"<Walk away without burning the books.>"
"204987124-0-25915";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-25916";"How can we find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-25917";"There must be some other way."
"204987124-0-25920";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-25923";"What kind of problems does the town face?"
"204987124-0-25925";"What sort of present?"
"204987124-0-25926";"You said the Clan Mother's last assistant quit?"
"204987124-0-25927";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-25928";"Shuzura said to say ""Bright Moons"" to you."
"204987124-0-25929";"How long have you been hearing these rats?"
"204987124-0-25931";"What are we going to do?"
"204987124-0-25934";"I will. And thank you, Tazia."
"204987124-0-25935";"Anything else I can do?"
"204987124-0-25936";"Maybe they haven't been turned."
"204987124-0-25938";"How can the <<CA:1>> give him all of Black Marsh?"
"204987124-0-25941";"He's opening it."
"204987124-0-25943";"Where did they come from?"
"204987124-0-25944";"Never heard of the Quickstep Bandits."
"204987124-0-25945";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-25946";"All right. I think I can handle that."
"204987124-0-25947";"What's the plan now?"
"204987124-0-25948";"Tell me more about the Black Daggers."
"204987124-0-25949";"We'll see about that."
"204987124-0-25953";"Where are you originally from?"
"204987124-0-25954";"I understand."
"204987124-0-25956";"What do you know about the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-25957";"What do you know about the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-25958";"Tell me about the Dominion."
"204987124-0-25961";"Any idea how to defeat him?"

"204987124-0-26159";"Well, good luck with the recovery."
"204987124-0-26160";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-26165";"I'll get the crystal and meet you outside."
"204987124-0-26169";"Is there anything more I can do?"
"204987124-0-26172";"What do you know about the Maormer mage?"
"204987124-0-26174";"I'm very sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-26176";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-26179";"I'd prefer the one skilled in restoration magic."
"204987124-0-26182";"What is this crystal?"
"204987124-0-26187";"I'll go look for the buried skooma."
"204987124-0-26190";"What are the gems for?"
"204987124-0-26191";"The Eight Divines?"
"204987124-0-26194";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-26196";"So how is Uwafa raising the consecrated dead?"
"204987124-0-26199";"Who are the Thalmor?"
"204987124-0-26200";"The fire injured one of the plantation's farmers."
"204987124-0-26202";"I need to ask you something else."
"204987124-0-26203";"If it comes down to my decision, which one of you should I choose?"
"204987124-0-26204";"Will the reversal work?"
"204987124-0-26205";"All right, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-26208";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-26209";"I'll get the crystal and meet you outside."
"204987124-0-26210";"What's Akatosh's plan?"
"204987124-0-26213";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-26214";"And he brought you here?"
"204987124-0-26218";"Wait. I found this skooma on the beach."
"204987124-0-26221";"You seem to be taking it well."
"204987124-0-26243";"A Crosstree bandit tried to take the skooma."
"204987124-0-26247";"Wait. I found this skooma on the beach."
"204987124-0-26250";"A Crosstree Bandit tried to take the skooma."
"204987124-0-26251";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-26257";"I'll do what I believe is right."
"204987124-0-26260";"It's possible. Other corpses have risen here as well."
"204987124-0-26261";"So what happens to me now?"
"204987124-0-26263";"What are you going to do with me?"
"204987124-0-26265";"What's an Orc doing here?"
"204987124-0-26266";"Is this your bar?"
"204987124-0-26267";"Is this your bar?"
"204987124-0-26271";"How did you get trapped in this thing?"
"204987124-0-26273";"Can you tell me anything about the ruins or the other relics?"
"204987124-0-26275";"She's exhausted, and speaking strangely."
"204987124-0-26276";"But the trials are over, right?"
"204987124-0-26279";"Tell me more about your Hist tree."
"204987124-0-26280";"How did your people wind up in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-26282";"How did your people wind up in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-26283";"What about Valaste?"
"204987124-0-26284";"What will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-26287";"I'll bring any skooma I find to you."
"204987124-0-26288";"Dangerous? Are you suggesting we kill him?"
"204987124-0-26290";"What is skooma?"
"204987124-0-26291";"Tell me more about your son."
"204987124-0-26292";"What is skooma?"
"204987124-0-26293";"What is skooma?"
"204987124-0-26294";"I refuse to accept he is beyond redemption. He lives and you should help him."
"204987124-0-26295";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-26299";"I'm sure. This can't happen again."
"204987124-0-26301";"I'm sure. He risked his life to save you."
"204987124-0-26302";"Perhaps your horse died of the smell."
"204987124-0-26303";"What is Yokeda Razul famous for?"
"204987124-0-26304";"You must have some idea what this source of power is."
"204987124-0-26306";"What will you do once they've been attended to?"
"204987124-0-26307";"Who was Armiger Rhina?"
"204987124-0-26308";"Who was Armiger Rhina?"
"204987124-0-26309";"Why the hostility?"
"204987124-0-26310";"Did you strike one of the dead?"
"204987124-0-26311";"[Lie] You're right, he's expecting me."
"204987124-0-26312";"I'll just head inside, then."
"204987124-0-26314";"Then what did you do?"
"204987124-0-26315";"That's it?"
"204987124-0-26319";"Your ancestors already know what you did. Do you honestly think avoiding them will help?"
"204987124-0-26320";"Is there an easy way to identify the patrols?"
"204987124-0-26322";"Hey, how did you know who I am?"
"204987124-0-26323";"I'm not like the others you've faced."
"204987124-0-26324";"Who are you two, exactly?"
"204987124-0-26325";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-26327";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-26328";"Why did you seek to kill him?"
"204987124-0-26329";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-26333";"I'd like to hear about Scouting missions."
"204987124-0-26334";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-26337";"I'll bring it to him."
"204987124-0-26339";"Where did you send the mages?"
"204987124-0-26341";"<<1>> fought well. We brought down <<2>> together."
"204987124-0-26342";"How can I get into the game?"
"204987124-0-26343";"Tell me more about this game of yours."
"204987124-0-26344";"It's all yours then."
"204987124-0-26345";"Aren't there guards?"
"204987124-0-26346";"Time to get to work, then."
"204987124-0-26347";"Anything I need to know about the next room?"
"204987124-0-26348";"If it comes down to my decision, which one of you should I choose?"
"204987124-0-26349";"What task were you given?"
"204987124-0-26350";"<Walk away. Walk away. Walk away.>"
"204987124-0-26352";"How do you know him?"
"204987124-0-26353";"<Watch the flames.>"
"204987124-0-26354";"Does it worry you, being on the outskirts of town?"

"204987124-0-26356";"<Continue to focus on the fire.>"
"204987124-0-26358";"<Enter the story.>"
"204987124-0-26359";"I will go speak to the king then."
"204987124-0-26361";"Did he explain why?"
"204987124-0-26362";"Do you know Niro Gratas?"
"204987124-0-26363";"What did you think of Niro?"
"204987124-0-26364";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-26365";"You think we should attack the Maormer now."
"204987124-0-26366";"I will investigate further."
"204987124-0-26367";"I cannot leave the marines there to die."
"204987124-0-26368";"We should attack before we are attacked."
"204987124-0-26372";"So why live here?"
"204987124-0-26373";"I meant, ""What does the letter say?"""

"204987124-0-26384";"So you're from Khenarthi's Roost?"
"204987124-0-26385";"So you were born on Khenarthi's Roost?"

"204987124-0-26422";"All right. I'll find the shadow for you."
"204987124-0-26424";"And how will the spell pacify the vampires?"
"204987124-0-26437";"Why?"
"204987124-0-26438";"Had any success?"
"204987124-0-26440";"So you plan to stay here?"

"204987124-0-26502";"What is at the end?"
"204987124-0-26503";"What is ja-Kha'jay?"
"204987124-0-26504";"The afterlife?"
"204987124-0-26505";"What do you know about it?"
"204987124-0-26506";"What is it, then?"
"204987124-0-26510";"Tell me again about Riddle'Thar."
"204987124-0-26511";"How did you come to be here?"
"204987124-0-26512";"They let you join?"
"204987124-0-26513";"What will you do with your training?"
"204987124-0-26517";"He will make a fine king. Counsel him well."
"204987124-0-26522";"Thank you, First Mane."
"204987124-0-26523";"Did you learn anything about <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-26524";"Alik'r?"
"204987124-0-26525";"… and Dune?"
"204987124-0-26526";"…and Alik'r?"
"204987124-0-26527";"Why aren't you out there?"
"204987124-0-26530";"Tell me more about what you're proposing."
"204987124-0-26531";"I'll help you turn the vampires into mindless beasts."
"204987124-0-26532";"I'll help you free the vampires from the Harvest Heart."
"204987124-0-26538";"You were going to tell us where Sai Sahan is."
"204987124-0-26540";"You don't know where he is?"
"204987124-0-26545";"That sounds reasonable. I'll join."
"204987124-0-26551";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26553";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26556";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26560";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26562";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26564";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26566";"I will. Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-26567";"What did she do?"
"204987124-0-26573";"Deal with them how?"
"204987124-0-26574";"Veri?"
"204987124-0-26575";"I see."
"204987124-0-26576";"I'm sorry about your wife."
"204987124-0-26577";"I see."
"204987124-0-26578";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26580";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26582";"[Fight[ Yes, I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-26584";"What will you do with him?"
"204987124-0-26591";"Is it always this dangerous?"
"204987124-0-26593";"Can you tell me more about the relics I'm looking for?"
"204987124-0-26594";"How many chapel guardians did you send into the ruins?"
"204987124-0-26595";"Do you know anything about this place or the bandits?"
"204987124-0-26596";"How many chapel guardians did you send into the ruins?"
"204987124-0-26597";"Why do you say that the bandits aren't very bright?"
"204987124-0-26600";"His generals? How do you know this?"
"204987124-0-26602";"Let's go get them, then."
"204987124-0-26603";"And how do I do that?"
"204987124-0-26604";"And how do I do that?"
"204987124-0-26605";"So you're telling me you're the victim in all this?"
"204987124-0-26608";"What then?"
"204987124-0-26610";"But a Goblin?"
"204987124-0-26611";"That's an interesting theory."
"204987124-0-26612";"So why did you leave?"
"204987124-0-26613";"I'll get you out. Are any of the other guards still alive?"
"204987124-0-26614";"All right. You'll be free in a moment."
"204987124-0-26615";"Where are you from?"
"204987124-0-26616";"But a Goblin?"
"204987124-0-26617";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26618";"Raz and I just fought together at Senalana."
"204987124-0-26619";"How do we get out of here?"
"204987124-0-26620";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26621";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26622";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26625";"I'll figure it out. Stay put."
"204987124-0-26632";"Do you need help with the investigation?"
"204987124-0-26634";"Why did the Magistrate say otherwise?"
"204987124-0-26640";"Can you tell me more about the ruins?"
"204987124-0-26641";"Where is Stibbons now?"
"204987124-0-26642";"Why do I have to activate these pillars?"
"204987124-0-26643";"The Pact guards, Cariel?"
"204987124-0-26644";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-26645";"I'll get it myself."
"204987124-0-26647";"Is your ship ready to sail?"
"204987124-0-26650";"I'm with you, Shazah."
"204987124-0-26651";"I'm ready if you are."
"204987124-0-26652";"Did something happen after the Tomb of Kings?"
"204987124-0-26653";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-26658";"Then let's get moving."
"204987124-0-26661";"Is there a plan you want to share with me?"
"204987124-0-26663";"Where are the crocodiles?"
"204987124-0-26664";"Who was <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-26665";"Where are the crocodiles?"
"204987124-0-26668";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-26669";"Who is Canonreeve Oraneth?"
"204987124-0-26670";"What do you mean? Did she succeed?"
"204987124-0-26671";"So, Kargand is inside?"
"204987124-0-26672";"Is Bakkhara dead?"
"204987124-0-26674";"Aelif, there was a guild insignia on the corpse."
"204987124-0-26683";"You sound hesitant."
"204987124-0-26685";"Yes. It's closed."
"204987124-0-26687";"What is the Trial of Spirit?"
"204987124-0-26688";"No. I freed him and he's gone now."
"204987124-0-26690";"I ran into Stibbons in your camp."
"204987124-0-26691";"I ran into Stibbons in your camp."
"204987124-0-26692";"I think he has all your tools."
"204987124-0-26693";"Head for the city to the east. It's safe there. I'll investigate the tower."
"204987124-0-26694";"What do you know about the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-26695";"I met an Orc who's been imprisoned here for centuries."
"204987124-0-26696";"I met an Orc who's been imprisoned here for centuries."
"204987124-0-26697";"What do you know about the lamias?"
"204987124-0-26698";"What about Faraniel?"
"204987124-0-26699";"What do you know about the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-26700";"And what was that?"
"204987124-0-26701";"Not the lamias?"
"204987124-0-26702";"What do you know about the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-26706";"Very well, I'll help you."
"204987124-0-26707";"Very well, I'll help you."
"204987124-0-26710";"Fakimal was behind the disappearances."
"204987124-0-26714";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-26715";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-26716";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-26717";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-26719";"Where is it?"
"204987124-0-26721";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-26722";"Aren't the Khajiit and Wood Elves allies?"
"204987124-0-26724";"Paying them in corpses to leave Bergama alone?"
"204987124-0-26727";"The Guildmaster doesn't lead the council?"
"204987124-0-26728";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-26732";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-26733";"Aelif summoned Jofnir in Ragnthar."
"204987124-0-26734";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-26736";"What's the next step?"
"204987124-0-26738";"She struck a deal with the Withered Hand."
"204987124-0-26741";"All right, then put me into the story."
"204987124-0-26742";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-26745";"May I please join Aranias in the story?"
"204987124-0-26748";"I will."
"204987124-0-26750";"Like your sister?"
"204987124-0-26754";"Stay close and follow me!"
"204987124-0-26755";"Follow me!"
"204987124-0-26757";"Who's the other guard on duty?"
"204987124-0-26759";"What did Seyran do to you? What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-26760";"Thanks for the advice. Where do you want to meet?"
"204987124-0-26761";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-26762";"Why isn't the military dealing with this?"
"204987124-0-26763";"What are you saying, Cariel?"
"204987124-0-26764";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26765";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26766";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26767";"You said you had some ideas on getting past the guards?"
"204987124-0-26768";"Raz and I just fought together at Senalana."
"204987124-0-26769";"Why isn't the military dealing with this?"
"204987124-0-26770";"Why do you need me for this?"
"204987124-0-26777";"Why would Casnar change his mind?"
"204987124-0-26779";"It was Justice Istah. He's in the stocks."
"204987124-0-26780";"What do you mean by ultimate fate?"
"204987124-0-26781";"What do you know of my mission?"
"204987124-0-26782";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-26784";"What have they decided?"
"204987124-0-26785";"What can we expect?"
"204987124-0-26786";"Represents something?"
"204987124-0-26788";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-26789";"Is everything all right?"
"204987124-0-26791";"I'll go find her, then."
"204987124-0-26792";"Why would Casnar change his mind?"
"204987124-0-26793";"Why would Casnar change his mind?"
"204987124-0-26794";"What makes you think Casnar is missing?"
"204987124-0-26796";"We'll see it done."
"204987124-0-26797";"Maybe it's a chance for everyone to come together."
"204987124-0-26798";"Are you ready to go?"
"204987124-0-26799";"Lead on, Khali."
"204987124-0-26801";"Are you ready to get started?"
"204987124-0-26802";"Lead on, Shazah."
"204987124-0-26804";"What makes you think Casnar is missing?"
"204987124-0-26805";"What do you know about the Kothringi?"
"204987124-0-26806";"Why are you talking like that?"
"204987124-0-26807";"I'm not sure I understand what's going on here."
"204987124-0-26808";"I found this letter. I think it's for you."
"204987124-0-26810";"Go on."
"204987124-0-26811";"<Leave the body alone.>"
"204987124-0-26814";"I'm game. Let's go."
"204987124-0-26818";"Did the bandits take the relics?"
"204987124-0-26819";"<Consecrate the body and retrieve the ring.>"
"204987124-0-26820";"Where do I get this key?"
"204987124-0-26822";"So it's safe to assume he's changed his mind?"
"204987124-0-26824";"Yes. I'll go see if Casnar is at the house."
"204987124-0-26825";"And what do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-26827";"<Leave the body.>"
"204987124-0-26828";"<Leave the body.>"
"204987124-0-26829";"Don't you want him to be happy?"
"204987124-0-26830";"Where are the rest of the scouts?"
"204987124-0-26831";"What are you doing in here?"
"204987124-0-26834";"How do I find Kyne's Tears again?"
"204987124-0-26835";"You have no souls?"
"204987124-0-26836";"And why do you need protection to do this?"
"204987124-0-26837";"The Thane doesn't seem affected by the mead, either."
"204987124-0-26838";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-26839";"How do we close the portal?"
"204987124-0-26840";"How big are their teeth?"
"204987124-0-26841";"Remind me what the warriors believe."
"204987124-0-26842";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-26843";"What do you need from us?"
"204987124-0-26845";"The Thane doesn't seem affected by the mead, either."
"204987124-0-26846";"I've got the flowers Nelhilda asked for."
"204987124-0-26848";"You disapprove?"
"204987124-0-26852";"Do they have large claws?"
"204987124-0-26853";"How big are their eyes?"
"204987124-0-26854";"Do they have large claws?"
"204987124-0-26855";"You think something bad is going to happen?"
"204987124-0-26857";"Have they been aggressive?"
"204987124-0-26859";"That sounds like a pretty wise perspective."
"204987124-0-26864";"What do you think of Warlock Carindon?"
"204987124-0-26865";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-26866";"What do you mean wherever we go next?"
"204987124-0-26870";"Will this be easy?"
"204987124-0-26872";"Who is Uncle Thahk?"
"204987124-0-26873";"How so?"
"204987124-0-26875";"You ran all the way here to tell me that?"
"204987124-0-26876";"Has anyone else entered the vault?"
"204987124-0-26878";"Why was he here?"
"204987124-0-26879";"Do you think the vicereeve stole the Staff of Magnus?"
"204987124-0-26881";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-26886";"I'll go talk to Uncle Thakh then."
"204987124-0-26887";"What was she trying to tell you?"
"204987124-0-26888";"You're welcome, Khali. Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-26889";"What do you suspect?"
"204987124-0-26891";"I'll handle it."
"204987124-0-26893";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-26896";"What's the problem?"
"204987124-0-26897";"I won't leave anyone behind. Give me that scroll."
"204987124-0-26898";"I won't leave anyone behind. Give me that scroll."
"204987124-0-26899";"I'll cast it then."
"204987124-0-26900";"You stay, Iniel."
"204987124-0-26906";"Why especially here?"
"204987124-0-26908";"Why do you want to find them?"
"204987124-0-26909";"How are you going to find them?"
"204987124-0-26911";"What's wrong with him?"
"204987124-0-26917";"How can I see these invisible runners?"
"204987124-0-26918";"I can handle the Bosmer if they attack again."
"204987124-0-26920";"We will see."
"204987124-0-26923";"I'll take care of the Thane."
"204987124-0-26927";"Let me know if you change your mind."
"204987124-0-26928";"Maybe I should just speak to them myself."
"204987124-0-26930";"You said something about bones and relics?"
"204987124-0-26931";"Who is Nethrin?"
"204987124-0-26932";"You said something about bones and relics?"
"204987124-0-26933";"What were those visions I saw in the temple?"
"204987124-0-26934";"Yes, we're ready."
"204987124-0-26935";"What happened after the last time we spoke?"
"204987124-0-26936";"And Jofnir?"
"204987124-0-26938";"Yes. She said you were hurt?"
"204987124-0-26939";"Tell me about Antias."
"204987124-0-26940";"So you want me to spy on Crowns and Forebears?"
"204987124-0-26941";"Yes. I can help with the investigation."
"204987124-0-26942";"Can you tell me more of the province generals?"
"204987124-0-26943";"And you're worried they'll be attacked."
"204987124-0-26945";"And you want me to check on your people."
"204987124-0-26947";"Why do they put up with it?"
"204987124-0-26948";"What can be done about them?"
"204987124-0-26949";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-26950";"What about the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-26951";"What about the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-26952";"I'll report back when I have something."
"204987124-0-26953";"Tell me about Antias."
"204987124-0-26955";"I'll get the relics out of here."
"204987124-0-26956";"I'll get the relics."
"204987124-0-26957";"How do we destroy it?"
"204987124-0-26958";"So I'll cast it."
"204987124-0-26959";"You stay, Sinien."
"204987124-0-26960";"I won't leave anyone behind. Give me the scroll."
"204987124-0-26961";"I won't leave anyone behind. Give me the scroll."
"204987124-0-26968";"And the elixir?"
"204987124-0-26969";"That's only two paths. What's the final path?"
"204987124-0-26970";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-26971";"Have you been there?"
"204987124-0-26986";"Sinien stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-26990";"Nara stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-26991";"Hazazi stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-26995";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-26999";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-27000";"Do you know who the Thane is?"
"204987124-0-27002";"Do you know who the Thane is?"
"204987124-0-27006";"The Hollow City is safe. You should go there."
"204987124-0-27008";"Go to the Hollow City with anyone who wants to leave. You'll be safe there."
"204987124-0-27010";"Is that all I need to do? Understand her?"
"204987124-0-27013";"Is he more dangerous in real life?"
"204987124-0-27015";"How do you know that?"
"204987124-0-27017";"Where is Aranias?"
"204987124-0-27018";"Will you tell the villagers how this happened?"
"204987124-0-27020";"He's dead, but he was taking orders from someone."
"204987124-0-27021";"Possibly. I found this mysterious key at Fakimal's."
"204987124-0-27022";"Yes. I'll go search the Magistrate's house."
"204987124-0-27023";"Maybe this will change your mind?"
"204987124-0-27026";"All right. Send <<1>> to find a replacement."
"204987124-0-27027";"What about Cropsford?"
"204987124-0-27028";"What would interest outsiders?"
"204987124-0-27029";"There are leaks on the Prowler that need patching."
"204987124-0-27030";"There are leaks on the Prowler that need patching."
"204987124-0-27031";"The Prowler needs a replacement <<z:1>>."
"204987124-0-27032";"The Prowler needs a replacement <<z:1>>."
"204987124-0-27033";"Yes, have <<1>> patch the leaks."
"204987124-0-27034";"Sure, send <<1>> to recover <<Az:2>>."
"204987124-0-27035";"There are leaks on the Prowler that need patching."
"204987124-0-27036";"Where can I find these lights?"
"204987124-0-27037";"Who runs Cropsford?"
"204987124-0-27038";"What would interest outsiders?"
"204987124-0-27039";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-27041";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-27042";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-27045";"What was that?"
"204987124-0-27046";"I'll look for her bow."
"204987124-0-27047";"No. I'm turning you in."
"204987124-0-27049";"I understand."
"204987124-0-27053";"There are leaks on the Prowler that need patching."
"204987124-0-27054";"She hoped they would spare Bergama."
"204987124-0-27056";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-27064";"I'll meet you at the village."
"204987124-0-27066";"Where did you live before?"
"204987124-0-27067";"I will find them, and bring you a belonging from each villager."
"204987124-0-27068";"You sound bitter."
"204987124-0-27076";"Does it pay well?"
"204987124-0-27077";"<<1>> wants your offering to Zenithar."
"204987124-0-27079";"Where'd you live before Cropsford?"
"204987124-0-27080";"Where are we going?"
"204987124-0-27081";"You seem scared of Niro Gratas."
"204987124-0-27082";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-27084";"I'll find any tools that survived the fire."
"204987124-0-27085";"Goblins?"
"204987124-0-27087";"Very well."
"204987124-0-27088";"What's Crown Point?"
"204987124-0-27089";"Goblins?"
"204987124-0-27091";"You have no idea what's going on, do you?"
"204987124-0-27092";"Were you really just on business? Are you telling the truth?"
"204987124-0-27093";"What do we do when we find Selene?"
"204987124-0-27094";"You have no idea what's going on, do you?"
"204987124-0-27095";"What if you squadmates are wounded?"
"204987124-0-27096";"What are you afraid of?"
"204987124-0-27101";"What do you know about the lamia?"
"204987124-0-27103";"What are you afraid of?"
"204987124-0-27107";"Lulius isn't from here?"
"204987124-0-27109";"I'll look for another path."
"204987124-0-27111";"You lost all of your mages, then."
"204987124-0-27113";"We'll speak after I deal with this."
"204987124-0-27114";"Your fellow mages didn't seem privy to this information."
"204987124-0-27115";"It's cheating."
"204987124-0-27117";"You've made a smart decision."
"204987124-0-27118";"That's a risk I'll just have to take."
"204987124-0-27120";"Why does he favor Cropsford?"
"204987124-0-27121";"You seem to have a close relationship with Zenithar."
"204987124-0-27126";"Was that Battlereeve Urcelmo that attacked you?"
"204987124-0-27127";"Can I help in the north?"
"204987124-0-27129";"Do you have some way to prove your innocence?"
"204987124-0-27135";"So the gems are here in the burial grounds?"
"204987124-0-27138";"It's too late for that. You should be content just to be consecrated."
"204987124-0-27145";"How did he do that?"
"204987124-0-27149";"I guess I don't see what the problem is?"
"204987124-0-27150";"What? Why?"
"204987124-0-27151";"I'll search his tent, then."
"204987124-0-27152";"You want me to go after the Admiral? I thought you wanted revenge."
"204987124-0-27153";"You want me to go after the Admiral? I thought you wanted revenge."
"204987124-0-27155";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-27156";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-27157";"Who is Ulmion?"
"204987124-0-27158";"I'll rescue the hostages and make sure they escape safely."
"204987124-0-27164";"I'm not sure who's in charge of this force."
"204987124-0-27165";"What should I do with the hostages when I find them?"
"204987124-0-27166";"Understood. Stay safe, Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-27167";"Not if I can stop them."
"204987124-0-27168";"No, but I've killed quite a few of them."
"204987124-0-27172";"What happened to the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-27173";"I thought you said everyone was acting strangely?"
"204987124-0-27174";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-27178";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-27179";"Halindor said people in town have been acting strangely?"
"204987124-0-27181";"Halindor said he'd just returned from business?"
"204987124-0-27182";"What happened in the cave?"
"204987124-0-27183";"What happened? Who was that?"
"204987124-0-27184";"[Lie] No, he was just very concerned about you."
"204987124-0-27185";"Not once?"
"204987124-0-27186";"Halindor said he'd just returned from business?"
"204987124-0-27188";"You were bringing the trolls to the arena and …?"
"204987124-0-27190";"What's so special about this ruin?"
"204987124-0-27191";"What's so special about this ruin?"
"204987124-0-27194";"You'll need to turn yourself in to Bowenas, Ezreba."
"204987124-0-27196";"Good. I'll see you at the exit."
"204987124-0-27199";"What did you learn as a cub?"
"204987124-0-27200";"What is this ruin they're unearthing?"
"204987124-0-27201";"What was that you said about the Stonefire Cult?"
"204987124-0-27203";"And then you were separated from the others?"
"204987124-0-27204";"Thank you, Halindor."
"204987124-0-27206";"What are the Dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-27207";"What happened to your husband?"
"204987124-0-27208";"Is the Dominion truly at an end?"
"204987124-0-27210";"It is nice. Did your father come with you?"
"204987124-0-27212";"Did you tell the other patrons what really happened?"
"204987124-0-27213";"Did you tell the other patrons what really happened?"
"204987124-0-27215";"We just finished fighting them. We were coming here to get something to eat…."
"204987124-0-27217";"And when you know what's planned …?"
"204987124-0-27226";"Yes."
"204987124-0-27227";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-27228";"Why did he become a bandit?"
"204987124-0-27229";"Who's leading this group?"
"204987124-0-27231";"I rescued an Ayleid King. He wants to help assemble our forces."
"204987124-0-27233";"I'll search for the corpse with the ring."
"204987124-0-27234";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-27237";"And what should we do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-27244";"I'm ready to make my decision."
"204987124-0-27245";"No, meet me outside. The way is clear. You'll be safe."
"204987124-0-27247";"Why Vlastarus?"
"204987124-0-27255";"[Service] Ezreba was coerced, and the villagers will forgive her. She should stay."
"204987124-0-27256";"What else can you tell me about the Elder Scrolls themselves?"
"204987124-0-27259";"She's fine. But we need to get you and the others out of here to repel the invasion."
"204987124-0-27260";"What then?"
"204987124-0-27261";"Why are the Elder Scrolls kept in temples?"
"204987124-0-27262";"I think that's all I need to know about the Elder Scrolls."
"204987124-0-27263";"I think that's all I need to know about the Elder Scrolls."
"204987124-0-27265";"I'll go speak with her."
"204987124-0-27267";"Take a drink of this and run for the bridge. Our allies will be waiting for you there."
"204987124-0-27269";"I don't think so. They took him, too."
"204987124-0-27270";"What about poor Munya?"
"204987124-0-27271";"Do you know why they call this hole in the ground the Tower of Lies?"
"204987124-0-27273";"That's not important right now. Drink this and run for the bridge. You'll be safe there."
"204987124-0-27274";"So he's not dead?"
"204987124-0-27277";"Might Munya come back as an undead?"
"204987124-0-27278";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-27280";"Anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-27282";"I'll meet you outside. The way is clear."
"204987124-0-27284";"What do you know about Ifriz?"
"204987124-0-27288";"I rescued Vanus. He wants to speak to you all."
"204987124-0-27290";"I'm not. He'll be here shortly."
"204987124-0-27292";"What do you know about Ifriz?"
"204987124-0-27293";"A Dremora? Is she a prisoner?"
"204987124-0-27294";"How did a tough guy like you get captured?"
"204987124-0-27296";"A werewolf with a conscience."
"204987124-0-27298";"Yes [Take Blood]"
"204987124-0-27301";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-27302";"So you have the ship designs?"
"204987124-0-27304";"Why does House Telvanni want the ship designs?"
"204987124-0-27305";"Where do you come from?"
"204987124-0-27307";"Give me the designs and you can go."
"204987124-0-27308";"Go on and leave then."
"204987124-0-27309";"Go on and leave then."
"204987124-0-27313";"<Place the shattered blade upon the coals.>"
"204987124-0-27315";"We will."
"204987124-0-27316";"Who were those people?"
"204987124-0-27317";"You're being held prisoner here, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-27320";"I can't just leave you."
"204987124-0-27324";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-27325";"Why do we need the Overseer's key?"
"204987124-0-27326";"Let's go deal with Overseer Aruz and get that key."
"204987124-0-27330";"Anything else you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-27337";"How do I get out there?"
"204987124-0-27341";"Why isn't he with you?"
"204987124-0-27343";"What's wrong with that?"
"204987124-0-27344";"Why was I summoned?"
"204987124-0-27345";"He said he's happy where he is."
"204987124-0-27346";"Where are King Dynar and Vanus?"
"204987124-0-27347";"Where are King Dynar and Vanus?"
"204987124-0-27348";"Where did everyone come from?"
"204987124-0-27350";"I just need one heartwood fragment."
"204987124-0-27351";"Why would the Worm Cult raid your village?"
"204987124-0-27352";"If I see Krodak, what should I tell him?"
"204987124-0-27354";"Thanks. Stay safe, Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-27356";"The Belle of Balfiera."
"204987124-0-27357";"There was a spy from Morrowind."
"204987124-0-27360";"Yes. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-27362";"The Dominion is already here. When the fighting starts, you don't think you're expendable?"
"204987124-0-27364";"Good. Drink this and get out of here. Make for the bridge."
"204987124-0-27366";"You can't be serious."
"204987124-0-27367";"Here. Take them."
"204987124-0-27368";"This is for the Mage Ranneth hired. You don't want to keep him waiting, do you?"
"204987124-0-27370";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-27375";"I'll talk to her."
"204987124-0-27376";"What's the problem?"
"204987124-0-27377";"Have you talked to Arakh?"
"204987124-0-27378";"Sarolion's daughter is adopted."
"204987124-0-27379";"Good. See that you do."
"204987124-0-27380";"Thank you, Sarolion."
"204987124-0-27381";"Have you talked to Arakh?"
"204987124-0-27382";"Have you talked to Arakh?"
"204987124-0-27383";"What's so important about your sword?"
"204987124-0-27384";"I found a ritual in your tent that might help?"
"204987124-0-27387";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-27388";"I'm just curious."
"204987124-0-27389";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-27390";"Any suggestions on how to accomplish that?"
"204987124-0-27391";"I'll find her helmet."
"204987124-0-27393";"And no one hassles you in here?"
"204987124-0-27395";"All right, let's start the council."
"204987124-0-27398";"She won't be a problem anymore."
"204987124-0-27400";"Why are you building ships at Tava's Blessing?"
"204987124-0-27404";"Where can I find her?"
"204987124-0-27405";"What makes these new warships so special?"
"204987124-0-27406";"Luck to you, too."
"204987124-0-27407";"I'll see you there, Pircalmo."
"204987124-0-27408";"I can do that. What do I need to get?"
"204987124-0-27409";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-27410";"What about the third ward?"
"204987124-0-27412";"Yes? That's why the Atronachs are here, right?"
"204987124-0-27413";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-27414";"What about flaming oil?"
"204987124-0-27415";"I should go free your subjects."
"204987124-0-27417";"I should go free your subjects."
"204987124-0-27419";"<Try Again.>"
"204987124-0-27421";"<Try Again.>"
"204987124-0-27423";"<Try Again.>"
"204987124-0-27425";"A Daedric altar was hidden up in the mountain. It twisted his spell."
"204987124-0-27426";"Where is Pircalmo?"
"204987124-0-27427";"I destroyed the altar. Pircalmo's magic should be fine now."
"204987124-0-27428";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-27429";"Are you worried about how your people will react?"
"204987124-0-27430";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-27432";"What were you checking on?"
"204987124-0-27434";"What should I do to change that?"
"204987124-0-27435";"<Pour the goat's milk over the blade.>"
"204987124-0-27436";"<Sprinkle the earth from a fallen warrior's grave over the blade.>"
"204987124-0-27437";"<Stoke the flames with the desert wind.>"
"204987124-0-27439";"<Stand back.>"
"204987124-0-27440";"<Pour goat's milk over the blade.>"
"204987124-0-27442";"<Sprinkle the earth from a fallen warrior's grave over the blade.>"
"204987124-0-27443";"<Stoke the flames with the desert wind.>"
"204987124-0-27444";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-27446";"Will you be able to survive?"
"204987124-0-27447";"I'll find Raz."
"204987124-0-27448";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-27450";"What can be done?"
"204987124-0-27451";"Good luck, Raz."
"204987124-0-27452";"I'll find her, Raz. I'll keep her safe."
"204987124-0-27453";"You'll be all right, my Queen. We can get you to safety."
"204987124-0-27454";"As you command, my Queen."
"204987124-0-27455";"Surely you can fight back?"
"204987124-0-27457";"Where is Aranias now?"
"204987124-0-27458";"Actually, the ghosts were illusion spells meant to scare her off. I took care of them as well."
"204987124-0-27459";"Several times, actually."
"204987124-0-27460";"What would you have me do?"
"204987124-0-27462";"Sounds like a good place to check out. I'll go right away, Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-27463";"Thank you, Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-27464";"You're ready, Shazah. You can do this. Just one more step on the path."
"204987124-0-27465";"Let's take that last step."
"204987124-0-27466";"Of course. Where is Andur now?"
"204987124-0-27467";"Yes. His name was Ostion. He was an Altmer mage."
"204987124-0-27471";"I am."
"204987124-0-27473";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-27474";"I'd like to hear about Scouting missions."
"204987124-0-27475";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-27478";"What are Battle missions?"
"204987124-0-27479";"How about Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-27480";"What are Battle missions?"
"204987124-0-27484";"Do you know why he was murdered?"
"204987124-0-27485";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-27486";"What do you think happened?"
"204987124-0-27487";"What's strange about it?"
"204987124-0-27488";"What makes this murder strange?"
"204987124-0-27489";"I'll bring this to him."
"204987124-0-27491";"Which legend?"
"204987124-0-27492";"And you think Navid's sword is here?"
"204987124-0-27494";"I'll start looking for the sword."
"204987124-0-27495";"What sort of connection?"
"204987124-0-27497";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-27498";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-27500";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-27501";"No, they're glowing and they're red."
"204987124-0-27502";"I think I know exactly what would happen."
"204987124-0-27503";"Why would the Withered Hand attack this place?"
"204987124-0-27507";"Why would the Withered Hand attack this place?"
"204987124-0-27508";"Where have you been since we parted ways?"
"204987124-0-27509";"Is the sword powerful?"
"204987124-0-27510";"Why does he want the sword?"
"204987124-0-27513";"Why do you work for him?"
"204987124-0-27514";"I'll do that. Thanks."
"204987124-0-27516";"Both the man and the woman were bandits."
"204987124-0-27521";"<<1>> used a wooden training sword."
"204987124-0-27522";"Different?"
"204987124-0-27523";"Yes. Just tell me what I need to do."
"204987124-0-27524";"What about flaming oil?"
"204987124-0-27525";"You should feel it already. Like I said, you're cured. You can go home now."
"204987124-0-27526";"Go home to him. He needs you."
"204987124-0-27527";"The vampires are gone. I destroyed them."
"204987124-0-27528";"How did you learn of Alasan's plan to become a lich?"
"204987124-0-27530";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-27531";"What are the various weapons?"
"204987124-0-27532";"Then I'll put the sword back."
"204987124-0-27533";"Can anything break the curse?"
"204987124-0-27534";"Then I'll put the sword back."
"204987124-0-27535";"Then I'll put the sword back."
"204987124-0-27537";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-27538";"I will."
"204987124-0-27539";"I'll return it to  <<1>>, then."
"204987124-0-27546";"Why did they come to Tava's Blessing?"
"204987124-0-27547";"Is there cheating taking place?"
"204987124-0-27548";"Anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-27552";"How did you learn of Alasan's plan to become a lich?"
"204987124-0-27553";"Then I'll put the sword back."
"204987124-0-27554";"I'll search his tent."
"204987124-0-27555";"Is there any way I can stop this from happening?"
"204987124-0-27556";"Really? I had no idea."
"204987124-0-27558";"No doubt there is wisdom in your words."
"204987124-0-27559";"Do you think he needs some help, then?"
"204987124-0-27560";"Aren't you frightened?"
"204987124-0-27561";"What else can you tell me about the Elder Scrolls themselves?"
"204987124-0-27568";"What do we get from doing this?"
"204987124-0-27572";"Think there's any truth to it?"
"204987124-0-27573";"I heard she could cure any ailment with her brews."
"204987124-0-27574";"Is there anyone who knows more about the story?"
"204987124-0-27577";"Yes she did, do you know why?"
"204987124-0-27579";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-27580";"I want to meet with her."
"204987124-0-27582";"Is it true she can cure any disease?"
"204987124-0-27583";"Fine, I'll smash the altar."
"204987124-0-27584";"Why are you bound here?"
"204987124-0-27589";"Can you tell me more about Clavicus Vile?"
"204987124-0-27590";"Yes? What do you know about it?"
"204987124-0-27591";"I'll go tell him the good news."
"204987124-0-27593";"What kind of potion will get me past the rubble?"
"204987124-0-27595";"Can't you just teleport me inside?"
"204987124-0-27596";"Were you part of the expedition to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-27598";"Can't you just teleport me inside?"
"204987124-0-27599";"I met Lady Laurent. You should find her at the Hollow City."
"204987124-0-27600";"That must have been terrible!"
"204987124-0-27601";"Do they? Really?"
"204987124-0-27603";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-27604";"I wouldn't be here if you hadn't involved the mages."
"204987124-0-27610";"I want to skip training."
"204987124-0-27612";"What is he doing up there?"
"204987124-0-27613";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-27614";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-27615";"Thanks, Cadwell."
"204987124-0-27616";"Why don't you come with us? We could use another hand."
"204987124-0-27622";"Give me Angof and the mages or your game will never be balanced again."
"204987124-0-27624";"I'll drink the potion now."
"204987124-0-27625";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-27626";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-27627";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-27631";"I'll bring them to her."
"204987124-0-27634";"Give me Thallik and the mages or your game will never be balanced again."
"204987124-0-27635";"Take care of yourself, then."
"204987124-0-27637";"You may want to talk to your guide, <<1>>, about the sword."
"204987124-0-27638";"May your research prove … interesting."
"204987124-0-27639";"Are you hurt, then?"
"204987124-0-27640";"Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-27642";"Give me Estre and the mages or your game will never be balanced again."
"204987124-0-27643";"It was <<1>>. She's asked me to kill him."
"204987124-0-27646";"How do I reforge the blade?"
"204987124-0-27647";"I will do as you ask and restore your ward."
"204987124-0-27648";"What are the various weapons?"
"204987124-0-27655";"Anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-27658";"You betrayed Queen Ayrenn!"
"204987124-0-27660";"I don't think <<1>> should die simply for being a vampire."
"204987124-0-27661";"Isn't that what you said last time?"
"204987124-0-27665";"Then why are you fighting in the game?"
"204987124-0-27667";"Is there a ram here I can use?"
"204987124-0-27668";"What can you tell me about the Elder Scrolls themselves?"
"204987124-0-27676";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-27677";"What do we get from doing this?"
"204987124-0-27679";"What's in it for you?"
"204987124-0-27682";"Anything else I need to know?"
"204987124-0-27683";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-27686";"All right, patience it is."
"204987124-0-27687";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-27688";"Take a ship? So he was a pirate?"
"204987124-0-27689";"Anything I can do to stop them?"
"204987124-0-27691";"What will happen to Leki's Blade?"
"204987124-0-27693";"What will happen to Leki's Blade?"
"204987124-0-27695";"Maybe there's something I can do."
"204987124-0-27699";"Where should I start the search?"
"204987124-0-27701";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-27702";"Yes, but the Ansei asked me to give it to someone I trust."
"204987124-0-27705";"Ansei Maja said there is another sibling."
"204987124-0-27706";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-27708";"I'll meet you outside."
"204987124-0-27711";"So you're doing the same thing here?"
"204987124-0-27714";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-27716";"What happened after you escaped the Spurned Peak?"
"204987124-0-27718";"How did you meet Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-27719";"You and Stibbons seem very friendly."
"204987124-0-27720";"Why does having the two souls weaken you so badly?"
"204987124-0-27722";"Why does having the two souls weaken you so badly?"
"204987124-0-27723";"What if we can't reverse the soul-meld?"
"204987124-0-27724";"I'll meet you inside."
"204987124-0-27725";"But you're saying that you need help?"
"204987124-0-27726";"I got the impression from your soldiers the militia is divided."
"204987124-0-27727";"Maybe if I ask around, I can find out what Gudarz is up to."
"204987124-0-27728";"Why not run them out?"
"204987124-0-27730";"That's between you and the Magistrate."
"204987124-0-27734";"Think of it as a sacrifice for the good of your fair city."
"204987124-0-27739";"How do they torment you?"
"204987124-0-27740";"I'll get the jewels back."
"204987124-0-27749";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-27751";"Who are you and why do you care about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-27755";"That's not going to happen."
"204987124-0-27756";"Who are you and why do you care about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-27757";"Let's hope."
"204987124-0-27758";"All right, let's go watch them."
"204987124-0-27759";"Who are you and why do you care about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-27762";"How can we release them?"
"204987124-0-27764";"All right. I'll go close the shadow rifts."
"204987124-0-27766";"No. It's better you rest now."
"204987124-0-27768";"Good. Then I'll count on your support."
"204987124-0-27769";"Is it really that bad?"
"204987124-0-27771";"So I talk to either of you if I'm looking for work?"
"204987124-0-27772";"What can you tell me about that tower?"
"204987124-0-27773";"Why is it locked up?"
"204987124-0-27774";"Who runs Vlastarus?"
"204987124-0-27778";"Killing the Eldest will violate the Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-27779";"How can I bring things back from a dream?"
"204987124-0-27780";"So I can expect help while I'm in there?"
"204987124-0-27781";"So you're willing to accompany me?"
"204987124-0-27782";"Why not send a full force?"
"204987124-0-27783";"Do you want to accompany me on this mission?"
"204987124-0-27784";"Accompany me on the initial assault."
"204987124-0-27786";"You will accompany me on my mission."
"204987124-0-27788";"I want you to accompany me on the initial assault."
"204987124-0-27790";"Why not join me in my initial assault?"
"204987124-0-27792";"Will you join the attack force?"
"204987124-0-27794";"Can you fight?"
"204987124-0-27796";"Well, if we make it that far, you'll be the first person I call."
"204987124-0-27798";"I hope to see you in there."
"204987124-0-27800";"Are the beetles usually this hostile?"
"204987124-0-27801";"Then I guess I'll get going."
"204987124-0-27803";"The Shadow Walkers are with us?"
"204987124-0-27805";"You will accompany me on my mission."
"204987124-0-27807";"Will you accompany me on the initial assault?"
"204987124-0-27809";"I appreciate the help."
"204987124-0-27811";"I'll take any help I can get."
"204987124-0-27814";"I hope I can depend on you."
"204987124-0-27817";"Do you think we have a chance?"
"204987124-0-27820";"Yes. I will check the johads for anything strange."
"204987124-0-27821";"Who are these cultists you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-27822";"Have you been anywhere since we last spoke?"
"204987124-0-27823";"Who are these cultists you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-27824";"<<1>> and I saved some of the eggs."
"204987124-0-27828";"Where was it the rest of the year?"
"204987124-0-27829";"Who were the Falinesti?"
"204987124-0-27830";"How have you been, Andewen?"
"204987124-0-27831";"How would we purge more of the blight from here?"
"204987124-0-27833";"How have you been, Andewen?"
"204987124-0-27834";"Telenger …?"
"204987124-0-27835";"I'll be careful. Let's go."
"204987124-0-27836";"Tell me more about Captain Blackheart."
"204987124-0-27837";"He wants to know what you're looking for in a bridegroom."
"204987124-0-27839";"<Destroy the scroll.>"
"204987124-0-27840";"Tell me about the Chasm's defenders."
"204987124-0-27841";"I have more questions."
"204987124-0-27842";"I have more questions."
"204987124-0-27843";"Molag Bal has a daughter?"
"204987124-0-27844";"Tell me about the Chasm's defenders."
"204987124-0-27845";"What happens after I destroy the focus stones?"
"204987124-0-27846";"They are. Go on now."
"204987124-0-27848";"Are you taking the other prisoners with you?"
"204987124-0-27849";"Go on then. Head south out of the city."
"204987124-0-27850";"Get going then."
"204987124-0-27851";"Where is this passage?"
"204987124-0-27858";"Surely there's some way you can help defeat the Shade."
"204987124-0-27860";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-27862";"Your assistants ran?"
"204987124-0-27864";"If it were up to me, I would spare her life."
"204987124-0-27866";"Yes, she should die for her crimes. [<<1>> dies]"
"204987124-0-27867";"So you're in no danger?"
"204987124-0-27868";"Can you tell me more about this temple?"
"204987124-0-27869";"<<1>> asked about the dowry …."
"204987124-0-27870";"The entrance? Is that safe?"
"204987124-0-27872";"I'll head over to Driladan Pass."
"204987124-0-27877";"I'll head over to Driladan Pass."
"204987124-0-27879";"I'll head over to Verrant Morass."
"204987124-0-27881";"I'll meet you at Hectahame."
"204987124-0-27885";"Why should I help a swindler?"
"204987124-0-27886";"I stayed behind to destroy the other Moonhenge."
"204987124-0-27888";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-27894";"Are you taking the other prisoners with you?"
"204987124-0-27895";"I'll grab the crystal and go find Skordo."
"204987124-0-27896";"Wait a moment. What exactly does this skull do?"
"204987124-0-27897";"Give me the keys and we'll leave your camp."
"204987124-0-27899";"Then I will try to catch up quickly."
"204987124-0-27900";"You can ask to join him once we're out of this camp. Give me the keys."
"204987124-0-27901";"You want me to fight your father?"
"204987124-0-27902";"Are you taking the other prisoners with you?"
"204987124-0-27903";"Didi you say something about a crystal?"
"204987124-0-27904";"Didi you say something about a crystal?"
"204987124-0-27905";"I'll go in the cave. Want to come with me?"
"204987124-0-27906";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-27907";"I can get the keystones while you study the pedestals."
"204987124-0-27910";"Mannimarco deceived him. It wasn't his fault."
"204987124-0-27911";"Where is Sai Sahan, now?"
"204987124-0-27912";"Then why do you blame Varen?"
"204987124-0-27913";"Just tell me why you called me here."
"204987124-0-27914";"Why is Sai Sahan so important?"
"204987124-0-27915";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-27916";"I'll set out at once and meet you there."
"204987124-0-27917";"Where is your throne?"
"204987124-0-27918";"I think that's all I need to know about the Elder Scrolls."
"204987124-0-27919";"I can try. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-27920";"Then you are ready for me to consecrate your remains?"
"204987124-0-27923";"Be at peace, Zariya."
"204987124-0-27925";"What if they kill the hostages?"
"204987124-0-27926";"Are the Imperials the greater threat now?"
"204987124-0-27927";"How do I find the hostages?"
"204987124-0-27928";"Will recovering the Ansei Wards make a difference?"
"204987124-0-27929";"When did the Imperials become allied with the Hand?"
"204987124-0-27932";"How do I find the hostages?"

"204987124-0-27952";"Have you really lost everything?"
"204987124-0-27953";"What will happen to you now?"
"204987124-0-27954";"Tell me more about yourself."

"204987124-0-27958";"Who is Ulmion?"
"204987124-0-27959";"But doesn't the Unwritten Law …."
"204987124-0-27964";"I'll return if I find anything."
"204987124-0-27965";"How've the mercenaries made things worse?"
"204987124-0-27967";"What makes you suspect Magnifico Khorshad?"
"204987124-0-27968";"I'll search the manor. You should get out of town."
"204987124-0-27969";"I'll see what I can learn."
"204987124-0-27970";"Were you able to free Rurelion?"
"204987124-0-27971";"You think she should be spared?"
"204987124-0-27972";"You believe she should live?"

"204987124-0-27989";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-27990";"So you aren't in favor of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-27996";"How can I stop them from coming through the tunnel?"
"204987124-0-27997";"You can go, but don't ever come back."
"204987124-0-27998";"Is that true?"
"204987124-0-27999";"<Examine the body.>"
"204987124-0-28001";"The harpies helped you?"
"204987124-0-28002";"Then let's go back to Kozanset and confront them."
"204987124-0-28003";"What are they celebrating?"
"204987124-0-28004";"Who is Lord Sanguine?"
"204987124-0-28006";"I'm ready to go if you'll take me!"
"204987124-0-28007";"A daughter? Really? That's kind of surprising."
"204987124-0-28009";"Any news from Camlorn?"
"204987124-0-28010";"You can ask Leja for yourself if you don't believe me."

"204987124-0-28014";"Take your sword."
"204987124-0-28017";"I will take the sword."
"204987124-0-28018";"I'm here to help. What can we do?"
"204987124-0-28020";"Let's see it done."
"204987124-0-28021";"Why don't you throw the bandits out?"
"204987124-0-28022";"Unique alignment? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-28025";"You and your sister are Manes?"
"204987124-0-28026";"What can you tell me about the Mane?"
"204987124-0-28027";"I'm not sure I understand."
"204987124-0-28028";"Really? What's he hiding?"
"204987124-0-28029";"Why didn't you tell me? Why the deception?"
"204987124-0-28030";"Are your wounds serious?"
"204987124-0-28031";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-28032";"What counterattack?"
"204987124-0-28034";"How can I trust you now? Or Lyris?"
"204987124-0-28036";"So, what now?"
"204987124-0-28037";"[Valaste Stays] I want you to cure Valaste."
"204987124-0-28038";"Why did you hit Tharn?"
"204987124-0-28040";"So now what do we do?"
"204987124-0-28044";"I'd be willing to help."
"204987124-0-28045";"I'd be willing to help."
"204987124-0-28046";"I'd be willing to help."
"204987124-0-28051";"Were you wounded?"
"204987124-0-28053";"Have things settled down in Stonefalls?"
"204987124-0-28054";"You should get to safety. Head to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-28057";"What makes these relics so important?"
"204987124-0-28058";"Where do I find the relics?"
"204987124-0-28059";"Where do I find the relics?"
"204987124-0-28060";"The scout called you a Champion?"
"204987124-0-28061";"Do you have any potions to help me this time?"
"204987124-0-28062";"Have things settled down in Stonefalls?"
"204987124-0-28063";"Have things settled down in Stonefalls?"
"204987124-0-28064";"Why have they invaded?"
"204987124-0-28065";"Where did they come from?"
"204987124-0-28066";"What are the Dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-28067";"Who are the Colovians?"
"204987124-0-28068";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-28069";"Shouldn't you hold the gate?"
"204987124-0-28071";"How do I track your wife?"
"204987124-0-28072";"You're going to kill your own wife?"
"204987124-0-28073";"What exactly is Pariel now?"
"204987124-0-28074";"You're going to kill your own wife?"
"204987124-0-28075";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-28076";"Which army was that?"
"204987124-0-28077";"Where do you think the voice came from?"
"204987124-0-28080";"I'll find her, Shazah."
"204987124-0-28082";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-28084";"And you think Navid's sword is here?"
"204987124-0-28088";"All right, come with me."
"204987124-0-28093";"How can the Eldest's heart help?"
"204987124-0-28094";"How can we cleanse the trees' spirits?"
"204987124-0-28096";"If it helps us cleanse the blight, that's a risk we have to take."
"204987124-0-28097";"But what will happen to you?"
"204987124-0-28099";"You're going to sacrifice yourself?"
"204987124-0-28100";"Naemon is defeated and Valenwood is safe."
"204987124-0-28101";"All right, come with me."
"204987124-0-28104";"Feel what?"
"204987124-0-28105";"But what if he doesn't treat you well? He's a madman."
"204987124-0-28109";"How do you feel?"
"204987124-0-28112";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-28113";"And he offered you this Folium?"
"204987124-0-28115";"And in the bargain you lost Eyevea."
"204987124-0-28116";"All right, come with me."
"204987124-0-28120";"Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me?"
"204987124-0-28121";"Very well. I'll leave you to your ritual."
"204987124-0-28122";"Then why have me track her down?"
"204987124-0-28124";"You cannot violate the Green Pact. This is wrong."
"204987124-0-28125";"Do what must be done, Thonoras."
"204987124-0-28128";"The people here are calling you the Silvenar?"
"204987124-0-28130";"It sounds like you've been in a number of battles."
"204987124-0-28131";"Have you fought the Colovians before?"
"204987124-0-28132";"You grew up in a monastery?"
"204987124-0-28133";"Have you ever encountered Dro-m'Athra before?"
"204987124-0-28134";"It sounds like you've been in a number of battles."
"204987124-0-28135";"I'd love to see one of your weapons."
"204987124-0-28138";"If it helps us cleanse the blight, that's a risk we have to take."
"204987124-0-28139";"What is a sword-singer?"
"204987124-0-28140";"You speak Tamrielic like an Imperial, Centurion."
"204987124-0-28141";"You speak Tamrielic like an Imperial, Centurion."
"204987124-0-28142";"You must choose this of your own accord."
"204987124-0-28144";"Are you ready to become Wilderqueen then?"
"204987124-0-28145";"You don't agree with being here?"
"204987124-0-28146";"Have they attacked anywhere else?"
"204987124-0-28147";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-28148";"Why is that agent you mentioned out here?"
"204987124-0-28149";"What was that you said about Arenthia?"
"204987124-0-28150";"What happened in Arenthia?"
"204987124-0-28151";"Have they attacked anywhere else?"
"204987124-0-28153";"How goes the battle?"
"204987124-0-28154";"How goes the battle?"
"204987124-0-28156";"Tell me the plan again."
"204987124-0-28157";"What do I get for being one of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-28158";"Why are you doing this again?"
"204987124-0-28161";"Rest easy, soldier. Help is on the way."
"204987124-0-28163";"Good luck, soldier. Thank you."
"204987124-0-28164";"Good luck, soldier. Thank you."
"204987124-0-28165";"Good luck, soldier. Thank you."
"204987124-0-28166";"Rest easy, soldier. Help is on the way."
"204987124-0-28167";"Rest easy, soldier. Help is on the way."
"204987124-0-28168";"Thank you, soldier. Good work."
"204987124-0-28169";"Thank you, soldier. Good work."
"204987124-0-28171";"Thank you, soldier. Good work."
"204987124-0-28172";"What does it do?"
"204987124-0-28174";"Why would the Ayleids create such a thing?"
"204987124-0-28175";"Why have you people come here?"
"204987124-0-28176";"I guess I'll be leaving you here, then."
"204987124-0-28178";"I'll figure it out."
"204987124-0-28179";"What happens if I destroy the circlet, again?"
"204987124-0-28180";"What happens if I destroy the circlet, again?"
"204987124-0-28181";"Why do you trust me with this?"
"204987124-0-28182";"Can't I just take the circlet and we can destroy it later?"
"204987124-0-28183";"Is it really worth your life?"
"204987124-0-28185";"I'll destroy <<Ac:1>>."
"204987124-0-28186";"I'll destroy <<Ac:1>>."
"204987124-0-28187";"Will you tell the villagers how this happened?"
"204987124-0-28188";"Why are you helping us?"
"204987124-0-28189";"Doesn't your daughter deserve the truth?"
"204987124-0-28190";"How do I find the hostages?"
"204987124-0-28191";"I can't just take the circlet and do something terrible with it?"
"204987124-0-28192";"What happens if I destroy the circlet, again?"
"204987124-0-28193";"I can't just take the circlet and do something terrible with it?"
"204987124-0-28195";"Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28196";"What's been happening in Kozanset?"
"204987124-0-28202";"Did you learn what the Sea Vipers plan for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28203";"Did you learn what the Sea Vipers plan for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28205";"I'll get the portal working."
"204987124-0-28208";"<Search the body.>"
"204987124-0-28211";"<Take the paper.>"
"204987124-0-28212";"Who attacked?"
"204987124-0-28213";"What did they want?"
"204987124-0-28214";"You should get to safety."
"204987124-0-28215";"You should get to safety."
"204987124-0-28216";"Why did they collapse the cave?"
"204987124-0-28221";"Take out the Valkynaz, got it."
"204987124-0-28223";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-28225";"The forest is full of Atronachs!"
"204987124-0-28226";"It's your fault those mages died."
"204987124-0-28227";"Why were you disguised as a Scamp?"
"204987124-0-28228";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-28229";"What is this path you speak of?"
"204987124-0-28231";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-28235";"As you say, Countess."
"204987124-0-28237";"As you say, Countess."
"204987124-0-28240";"Why do you want me to speak for your tribe?"
"204987124-0-28241";"It's better than being in the Tower of Lies, isn't it?"
"204987124-0-28242";"They're dead. I stopped them."
"204987124-0-28243";"You seem a little nervous."
"204987124-0-28244";"It's better than being in the Tower of Lies, isn't it?"
"204987124-0-28245";"[Lie] I heard them talking about fishing in the deep seas. Maybe they took a boat?"
"204987124-0-28246";"Why do you want me to do this?"
"204987124-0-28250";"Will you help me in the coming battle?"
"204987124-0-28252";"What's worse than a hurricane?"
"204987124-0-28258";"No, what?"
"204987124-0-28260";"Try it."
"204987124-0-28261";"I'm trying to help him out. Can I have that piece of quartz?"
"204987124-0-28262";"I'll get the meat pies and be right back."
"204987124-0-28263";"Thank you. He had some other relics with him last night. Did you see what he did with them?"
"204987124-0-28264";"Thank you. He had some other relics with him last night. Did you see what he did with them?"
"204987124-0-28265";"The Crowns aren't fond of the Covenant, are they?"
"204987124-0-28266";"What else do you know about the third Ward?"
"204987124-0-28267";"What else do you know about the third Ward?"
"204987124-0-28268";"Have you spoken with Captain Rawan?"
"204987124-0-28269";"Have you spoken with Captain Rawan?"
"204987124-0-28271";"How do I deactivate the wards protecting the Fighters Guild hall?"
"204987124-0-28274";"I remember fighting by your side in Cath Bedraud."
"204987124-0-28275";"Any news from Camlorn?"
"204987124-0-28276";"Tell me why the Sea Vipers need these <<m:1>>."
"204987124-0-28278";"I don't suppose you have any intention of withdrawing?"
"204987124-0-28279";"What now, then?"
"204987124-0-28281";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-28283";"I'll take care of Gudarz."
"204987124-0-28284";"Do you know why they're digging?"
"204987124-0-28288";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-28289";"Thank you. He had some other relics with him. Did you see what he did with them?"
"204987124-0-28291";"You sold it?"
"204987124-0-28292";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-28293";"Do you have any ideas on how I can get inside the walls?"
"204987124-0-28294";"The ward key?"
"204987124-0-28295";"How do I deactivate the wards protecting the Fighters Guild hall?"
"204987124-0-28296";"I think I met her before."
"204987124-0-28297";"What purpose do those beasts serve?"
"204987124-0-28298";"Can you elaborate on those patrols?"
"204987124-0-28299";"Raz and I just fought together at Senalana."
"204987124-0-28300";"Can you elaborate on those patrols?"
"204987124-0-28301";"Can you elaborate on those patrols?"
"204987124-0-28302";"Can you elaborate on those patrols?"
"204987124-0-28303";"Yes. Let's sail back."
"204987124-0-28305";"Can I ask you a few questions?"
"204987124-0-28307";"There must be a way to stop this."
"204987124-0-28310";"What happens when I release <<A:1>> from its bonds?"
"204987124-0-28311";"All right. I'll stop the Sea Viper ritual."
"204987124-0-28313";"And once she's gone?"
"204987124-0-28314";"This curse is your responsibility. You cannot place the burden on others."
"204987124-0-28315";"What does this mean for Indaenir?"
"204987124-0-28316";"Yes, he is."
"204987124-0-28318";"I see."
"204987124-0-28320";"I will."
"204987124-0-28321";"You really think you'll be able to retake the city?"
"204987124-0-28322";"How are we going to get him to talk?"
"204987124-0-28323";"Can you explain a bit more about this plan?"
"204987124-0-28325";"Who are all these people?"
"204987124-0-28326";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-28328";"There's one more thing. Indaenir is the Silvenar."
"204987124-0-28329";"No, but I took this from a murderer's cache."
"204987124-0-28331";"Sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-28332";"A two-pronged attack?"
"204987124-0-28333";"How do you know about these guild halls?"
"204987124-0-28334";"I think she's dead, murdered."
"204987124-0-28335";"What about the barricades around your village?"
"204987124-0-28336";"Will you help us?"
"204987124-0-28338";"No. The murderer kept items from his victims. Do you recognize anything here?"
"204987124-0-28339";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-28340";"Why should we trust you?"
"204987124-0-28341";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-28342";"Wisps from the urn are stealing things?"
"204987124-0-28343";"Why are you willing to help?"
"204987124-0-28344";"Why should we trust you?"
"204987124-0-28345";"I'd like you to come with me."
"204987124-0-28346";"Vengeance? Against us, do you think?"
"204987124-0-28347";"I'll be right back."
"204987124-0-28349";"Someone claimed to have killed her."
"204987124-0-28352";"I found these. Any of them belong to your sister?"
"204987124-0-28353";"I'll leave you to your thoughts."
"204987124-0-28354";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-28355";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-28356";"I think she's dead."
"204987124-0-28357";"What fob? Did you see what he did with that other relic?"
"204987124-0-28358";"Who would want to poison your water?"
"204987124-0-28360";"What will you do while I'm talking to him?"
"204987124-0-28361";"So I'll appear as Gavo, then. What about Gavo?"
"204987124-0-28362";"The killer had these items. Do you recognize any of them?"
"204987124-0-28364";"Do you know where Thaellin is?"
"204987124-0-28365";"I'm sorry for your loss, Flavia."
"204987124-0-28366";"How did your tribe end up in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28367";"Why did you settle here?"
"204987124-0-28368";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-28369";"Why do you want to become a spinner?"
"204987124-0-28372";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-28373";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-28376";"Tell me about Laeneval."
"204987124-0-28377";"Good luck, Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-28378";"What did they take?"
"204987124-0-28379";"Nothing. I didn't say anything."
"204987124-0-28380";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-28382";"Did you hear them say where they were going?"
"204987124-0-28384";"Will it grow back after we kill it?"
"204987124-0-28385";"She and Ranneth should be just down the ramp."
"204987124-0-28386";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-28387";"What do I do if I find Shiri?"
"204987124-0-28389";"Why would Shiri visit her cousin in Satakalaam?"
"204987124-0-28390";"How did you get injured?"
"204987124-0-28391";"If I give the command now, what are our chances?"
"204987124-0-28392";"I will help you."
"204987124-0-28393";"I can do that."
"204987124-0-28394";"Threatened? By what?"
"204987124-0-28395";"What makes you think Shiri planned all this?"
"204987124-0-28398";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-28399";"I've seen his handiwork firsthand at Fort Grimwatch."
"204987124-0-28400";"Can you explain a bit more about this plan?"
"204987124-0-28401";"What will you do with him?"
"204987124-0-28402";"What will you do with him?"
"204987124-0-28403";"Have you noticed anything different about the school?"
"204987124-0-28404";"I'll face them all. I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-28405";"How did you find the connection between the Colovians and the cult?"
"204987124-0-28408";"I need to find more allies to bolster our forces."
"204987124-0-28411";"Any guess where she might have gone?"
"204987124-0-28412";"What can I expect inside the Citadel?"
"204987124-0-28413";"You're using me?"
"204987124-0-28414";"What can I expect inside the Citadel?"
"204987124-0-28415";"Why are you helping us?"
"204987124-0-28416";"What can you tell me about the Swordmaster Division?"
"204987124-0-28417";"Who is he?"
"204987124-0-28418";"Can you tell me more about the Stonefire cult?"
"204987124-0-28419";"How did the Colovians take the city?"
"204987124-0-28420";"Can you tell me more about the Stonefire cult?"
"204987124-0-28421";"Who runs the arena?"
"204987124-0-28422";"Who runs the arena?"
"204987124-0-28423";"Anything you can tell me about the Sorcerer Division?"
"204987124-0-28424";"Who runs the arena?"
"204987124-0-28426";"I'm ready to win."
"204987124-0-28428";"I understand."
"204987124-0-28429";"How is he doing that?"
"204987124-0-28433";"I'm with you."
"204987124-0-28434";"I'm with you."
"204987124-0-28435";"Labyrinth? What Labyrinth?"
"204987124-0-28436";"Can you tell me more about the Staff of Magnus?"
"204987124-0-28438";"I'll get the key from the Valkynaz."
"204987124-0-28440";"Where can I find the contenders?"
"204987124-0-28442";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-28443";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-28445";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-28448";"Why?"
"204987124-0-28450";"How is it going?"
"204987124-0-28451";"Why did your son flee?"
"204987124-0-28452";"And you want to bring him back?"
"204987124-0-28453";"Then let's take care of those Daedra."
"204987124-0-28455";"I'll look for the breach."
"204987124-0-28456";"How is the fight going?"
"204987124-0-28457";"What was special about the necklace?"
"204987124-0-28459";"What was special about the necklace?"
"204987124-0-28460";"You mentioned someone named Meldil? Who is that?"
"204987124-0-28469";"And if Tertius doesn't find him?"
"204987124-0-28471";"What is the fighting all about?"
"204987124-0-28472";"What will you do once Tertius finds your son?"
"204987124-0-28473";"Let's clear the Daedra out of the north and south fronts."
"204987124-0-28475";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-28476";"Why do you suspect her?"
"204987124-0-28477";"What about your husband?"
"204987124-0-28481";"She died fighting."
"204987124-0-28482";"Let's clear the Daedra out of those fronts."
"204987124-0-28483";"What is the Canonreeve doing in the Hollow?"
"204987124-0-28484";"And so you suspected wrongdoing on her part?"
"204987124-0-28485";"What's your part in this?"
"204987124-0-28486";"Why don't you leave?"
"204987124-0-28489";"That's about it."
"204987124-0-28492";"I'll be going now."
"204987124-0-28493";"And that's why Brielus sent you away?"
"204987124-0-28494";"Why do the Orcs stand in your way?"
"204987124-0-28497";"What about those cultists in the temple district?"
"204987124-0-28498";"Surely Tu'whacca can forgive you somehow."
"204987124-0-28499";"Then lend me your bow, Elolir."
"204987124-0-28501";"Alone. In the wilderness."
"204987124-0-28502";"I'm ready. Open the door."
"204987124-0-28507";"But he left Cheydinhal?"
"204987124-0-28508";"Why are you on this side of the river?"
"204987124-0-28511";"If I do this, can I have the urn?"
"204987124-0-28512";"When did they take over the estate?"
"204987124-0-28513";"I'll try it."
"204987124-0-28516";"Why not attack in force, wipe them out?"
"204987124-0-28518";"And Sylvian commands the rebels?"
"204987124-0-28520";"Well, what do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-28521";"<Nudge <<1>> with your foot.>"
"204987124-0-28522";"What will happen to the Centurion?"
"204987124-0-28523";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-28525";"Why are they fighting?"
"204987124-0-28527";"What sparked the rebellion?"
"204987124-0-28528";"You look less worried than usual, Vyctoria."
"204987124-0-28529";"How long have you been here?"
"204987124-0-28530";"How do you know Lyris?"
"204987124-0-28533";"How will I know the planar vortex when I find it?"
"204987124-0-28536";"It left this place. Do you know where it went?"
"204987124-0-28537";"Where do I go now?"
"204987124-0-28539";"Thank you, Ansei Halelah."
"204987124-0-28545";"What sparked the fighting?"
"204987124-0-28546";"Why the heavy scowl, Sylvian?"
"204987124-0-28549";"Why would the Canonreeve come here?"
"204987124-0-28550";"You should probably keep that information to yourself."
"204987124-0-28551";"All right, let's go watch them."
"204987124-0-28553";"Is the situation really that dire?"
"204987124-0-28557";"The truth may well destroy Leki's Blade. We need all the swordsmen we can get."
"204987124-0-28559";"How did Throne Keeper Farvad get here?"
"204987124-0-28560";"So she's a necromancer?"
"204987124-0-28561";"Throne Keeper Farvad is here?"
"204987124-0-28562";"How did you learn about Shiri?"
"204987124-0-28565";"Was anyone else with Prince Azah?"
"204987124-0-28566";"I elected to spare her."
"204987124-0-28567";"Marital troubles?"
"204987124-0-28569";"How do we stop her?"
"204987124-0-28570";"Is she still in there?"
"204987124-0-28574";"The time was not right. Once things calm down, you can deal with her."
"204987124-0-28575";"He's your husband?"
"204987124-0-28577";"Of course, but what am I protecting you from?"
"204987124-0-28578";"I'm ready. Let's do this."
"204987124-0-28579";"What then?"
"204987124-0-28581";"Where would you go?"
"204987124-0-28583";"I'll deal with Erthas."
"204987124-0-28584";"What makes him so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-28587";"Then I'd like you to join me, Farvad."
"204987124-0-28589";"I want you join me then, Your Highness."
"204987124-0-28591";"Then let's do this together, Talia."
"204987124-0-28593";"We are sworn to slay the risen dead, sacred ancestors. She is neither risen nor an ancestor."
"204987124-0-28594";"So you see no difference between her and those raised by the Withered Hand?"
"204987124-0-28598";"Talia has placed her faith in my judgment. I say she is not a risen ancestor, Now fall in line."
"204987124-0-28599";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-28600";"How do I repair?"
"204987124-0-28602";"What does Vanus want?"
"204987124-0-28603";"All right. I'll make my choice."
"204987124-0-28604";"How do we stop Shiri then?"
"204987124-0-28606";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-28607";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-28608";"What about the other missions?"
"204987124-0-28609";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-28610";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-28611";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-28612";"Are you happy now that Valkynaz Seris is dead?"
"204987124-0-28613";"But you asked me to slay him."
"204987124-0-28614";"Are you happy now that Valkynaz Seris is dead?"
"204987124-0-28615";"Will you help us assault the Endless Stair?"
"204987124-0-28617";"What if they don't support you?"
"204987124-0-28618";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-28619";"What do you think of the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-28620";"How does that make you a leader?"
"204987124-0-28621";"You'll provide security for the meeting?"
"204987124-0-28623";"What does you tribe think about the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-28624";"Are you asking me to fight you?"
"204987124-0-28625";"What now, Mane?"
"204987124-0-28627";"Bright Moons, Shazah."
"204987124-0-28630";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-28631";"You think the Dominion are slavemasters?"
"204987124-0-28633";"What is your role in this tribe?"
"204987124-0-28635";"Meeting their guides? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-28636";"A decision? A decision about what?"
"204987124-0-28637";"Meeting their guides? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-28638";"What's the point of this ritual?"
"204987124-0-28639";"What's the point of this ritual?"
"204987124-0-28642";"Knahaten flu?"
"204987124-0-28643";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-28644";"What is the Canonreeve doing in the Hollow?"
"204987124-0-28645";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-28646";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-28648";"Lead on, then."
"204987124-0-28651";"I'll look for the breach."
"204987124-0-28653";"What are the orders from the king?"
"204987124-0-28655";"I'll get the portal working."
"204987124-0-28656";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-28657";"It created zombies?"
"204987124-0-28658";"What is the Labyrinth?"
"204987124-0-28659";"What is the Labyrinth?"
"204987124-0-28660";"Who is Valkynaz Seris?"
"204987124-0-28661";"Let's look for a way out of here."
"204987124-0-28665";"I'll feed an elder spider."
"204987124-0-28666";"We don't know that Bakkhara and Dracien are truly lost."
"204987124-0-28667";"How can you stop the harpies?"
"204987124-0-28669";"The Shade said it had the bow."
"204987124-0-28672";"How can we release them?"
"204987124-0-28673";"All right. I'll go close the shadow rifts."
"204987124-0-28680";"All right. I'll buy some."
"204987124-0-28683";"Perhaps I can buy <<A:1>> from you?"
"204987124-0-28684";"So you had heard of General Malgoth?"
"204987124-0-28685";"And the Vullain villagers took advantage of that?"
"204987124-0-28686";"How do you steal something from a dead person?"
"204987124-0-28687";"That's a big lizard."
"204987124-0-28688";"Perhaps I can buy <<A:1>> from you?"
"204987124-0-28690";"That's a big lizard."
"204987124-0-28693";"Why did the nereids even get involved?"
"204987124-0-28694";"But General Malgoth was an exception?"
"204987124-0-28696";"Why would the villagers turn to the nereids?"
"204987124-0-28697";"Why would the villagers turn to the Nereids?"
"204987124-0-28698";"You want me to help kill <<1>>'s hunters?"
"204987124-0-28699";"All right, I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-28700";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28701";"Why did you leave?"
"204987124-0-28706";"But won't she attack the town?"
"204987124-0-28708";"What will I do with the eggs?"
"204987124-0-28710";"Can I try the race again?"
"204987124-0-28711";"Do you have anything that could help my lizard?"
"204987124-0-28712";"What about flaming oil?"
"204987124-0-28713";"What were the Bosmer tribal wars?"
"204987124-0-28714";"So you had heard of General Malgoth?"
"204987124-0-28721";"Are you ready to move on?"
"204987124-0-28722";"Lead on, Shazah."
"204987124-0-28726";"The Senche killed your dog?"
"204987124-0-28727";"Will you write songs again?"
"204987124-0-28729";"How do I track the Senche?"
"204987124-0-28730";"I'll locate those stolen harpy eggs and bring them back."
"204987124-0-28732";"You suspect one of the Altmers of kidnapping Erinel?"
"204987124-0-28733";"Why do you trust me with this relic?"
"204987124-0-28734";"How can the links be broken?"
"204987124-0-28736";"The great tree?"
"204987124-0-28737";"How do you even know Erinel's been kidnapped?"
"204987124-0-28738";"Did you really think you could walk into a camp of Wood Orcs?"
"204987124-0-28739";"Where is Falinesti now?"
"204987124-0-28740";"Haven't your sites been attacked before?"
"204987124-0-28741";"Tell me more about the Falinesti Faithful."
"204987124-0-28742";"Do you know where to find the others?"
"204987124-0-28744";"Hold still and I'll get you out of those ropes."
"204987124-0-28745";"How do you plan to do that?"
"204987124-0-28748";"Let's get you out of these ropes first."
"204987124-0-28749";"How?"
"204987124-0-28750";"Then why are you bound like a prisoner?"
"204987124-0-28751";"You want to murder his entire family?"
"204987124-0-28752";"I'm not helping you in blind vengeance. You're on your own."
"204987124-0-28753";"What will that solve?"
"204987124-0-28755";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-28758";"What about Chief Gorzesh?"
"204987124-0-28762";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-28764";"You're right. You have to do what your culture demands."
"204987124-0-28770";"Well, at least there's a party for you now. It's a good sign."
"204987124-0-28772";"What have the Sea Vipers done?"
"204987124-0-28773";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-28774";"Where are the others located?"
"204987124-0-28778";"What can you tell me about Driladan Pass?"
"204987124-0-28779";"What camp outside town?"
"204987124-0-28781";"I'll do as you ask."
"204987124-0-28782";"The Sea Vipers created the storm?"
"204987124-0-28784";"Why would the Sea Viper's wrist glow?"
"204987124-0-28785";"Why did he think he could take care of this on his own?"
"204987124-0-28786";"Anything to do with the message I'm delivering?"
"204987124-0-28787";"So repair the shrines and we get into the sanctum."
"204987124-0-28788";"How can the Eldest's heart help us?"
"204987124-0-28789";"Why aren't you welcome in Bruma?"
"204987124-0-28790";"What's the fighting about?"
"204987124-0-28792";"I'll check out Driladan Pass."
"204987124-0-28793";"I'll check out Dread Vullain."
"204987124-0-28794";"I'll check out Verrant Morass."
"204987124-0-28796";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-28797";"So repair the shrines and we get into the sanctum."
"204987124-0-28798";"There's a body behind that wall."
"204987124-0-28799";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-28800";"I'm freeing you. Make for the rally point."
"204987124-0-28802";"I saw a transcript of your interrogation. You hate your superiors."
"204987124-0-28804";"I'm untying you. Meet Thragof at the rally point."
"204987124-0-28805";"Who were the Nedic peoples?"
"204987124-0-28806";"What exactly happened to Gorzesh and the rest of his family?"
"204987124-0-28807";"So we need to find a source of power?"
"204987124-0-28809";"What's happening here?"
"204987124-0-28810";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-28812";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-28815";"I'll help, if I can."
"204987124-0-28816";"I'm not. What needs to be done?"
"204987124-0-28817";"You seemed to know Molag Grunda. Does it bother you that we had to kill her?"
"204987124-0-28820";"What do you need from me?"
"204987124-0-28821";"You want me to speak with the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-28823";"Making history?"
"204987124-0-28824";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-28833";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-28837";"Cadwell?"
"204987124-0-28838";"What can you tell me about her?"
"204987124-0-28844";"So I shouldn't stay long?"
"204987124-0-28851";"Lucky? How so?"
"204987124-0-28853";"We'll speak after I deal with this."
"204987124-0-28856";"What will you do with Selene's soul?"
"204987124-0-28857";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-28860";"Can you tell me more about the Claw?"
"204987124-0-28861";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-28862";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-28867";"Why would you need an assassin?"
"204987124-0-28868";"No thank you, my business is with Nellor directly."
"204987124-0-28870";"What's your part?"
"204987124-0-28871";"Yes, I am."
"204987124-0-28872";"It must be strange sharing your body with someone else."
"204987124-0-28874";"And how were you captured?"
"204987124-0-28875";"Then what purpose does this device serve?"
"204987124-0-28876";"And what does the Great Shackle do?"
"204987124-0-28877";"Why do they need Vanus to power the Great Shackle?"
"204987124-0-28878";"I will return the wards to Sentinel then."
"204987124-0-28879";"Is <<1>> a guar?"
"204987124-0-28881";"All right, I'll take care of <<1>> and <<2>>."
"204987124-0-28883";"Will you return the energy that was fed to you?"
"204987124-0-28886";"I was told to report to you."
"204987124-0-28888";"I'll help Vanus if I can."
"204987124-0-28889";"I'll do what I think is right."
"204987124-0-28890";"You want me to lie about what happened?"
"204987124-0-28892";"Yes, I'm sure."
"204987124-0-28895";"Do what you must."
"204987124-0-28897";"The Dominion has nothing to fear from these people."
"204987124-0-28900";"There's a headdress?"
"204987124-0-28901";"You're excited by the architecture?"
"204987124-0-28902";"Where were the mercenaries when this happened?"
"204987124-0-28904";"Thinking about tomorrow?"
"204987124-0-28906";"Well, I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-28908";"Hand over what you have or I'll take it from your corpse."
"204987124-0-28910";"I'll talk to her and get it back."
"204987124-0-28911";"I don't have time for this. Give me whatever you do have or pay with your blood."
"204987124-0-28913";"You're running out of options. I'll be back after I talk to Farwen."
"204987124-0-28914";"Can you say more?"
"204987124-0-28915";"And how were you captured?"
"204987124-0-28918";"The danger is too great. I should kill him before he creates another crisis like this one."
"204987124-0-28919";"I refuse to accept he is beyond redemption. He lives and you should help him."
"204987124-0-28920";"What is it you want?"
"204987124-0-28926";"Can you say more?"
"204987124-0-28927";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-28929";"That's not a decision I can make for Manthir. You should come talk to him."
"204987124-0-28939";"Can you say more?"
"204987124-0-28943";"Can't we just destroy him?"
"204987124-0-28948";"Rid-Thar, can you help me decide?"
"204987124-0-28949";"Tell me again, I have to choose one of the Champions to contain the Dark Mane?"
"204987124-0-28950";"Can you say more?"
"204987124-0-28957";"If you won't release us, I'll force you."
"204987124-0-28958";"Is there any way I can convince you to let these two go?"
"204987124-0-28959";"If you become Mane, what would you do?"
"204987124-0-28960";"You can't see him? He's right in front of you."
"204987124-0-28962";"You'd give up your life for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-28965";"Then what purpose does this device serve?"
"204987124-0-28967";"Ook ook?"
"204987124-0-28968";"Tell me about your people."
"204987124-0-28969";"Can you say more?"
"204987124-0-28973";"Is there any way I can convince you to let these two go?"
"204987124-0-28974";"I must talk to him first."
"204987124-0-28975";"They can both stay, if you keep your word."
"204987124-0-28978";"If you become Mane, what would you do?"
"204987124-0-28979";"So you want to take on the Dark Mane's mantle?"
"204987124-0-28980";"So you want to take on the Dark Mane's mantle?"
"204987124-0-28982";"The catalyst?"
"204987124-0-28983";"Are you sure you should become the Dark Mane?"
"204987124-0-28984";"Are you sure you should become the Dark Mane?"
"204987124-0-28986";"How did you wind up in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-28987";"But you're different?"
"204987124-0-28988";"So your ancestors just gave up?"
"204987124-0-28989";"Here's the bark."
"204987124-0-28991";"What did you explode?"
"204987124-0-28992";"How were you and Gadris able to work in here?"
"204987124-0-28993";"The catalyst?"
"204987124-0-28999";"What do I need to do at the forge?"
"204987124-0-29000";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-29002";"Baandari?"
"204987124-0-29006";"Consider it done."
"204987124-0-29007";"I'm afraid not."
"204987124-0-29008";"And you say you're stuck?"
"204987124-0-29009";"And they became the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-29010";"Why can't you leave?"
"204987124-0-29011";"So you're just waiting while it's fixed?"
"204987124-0-29012";"So here you sit."
"204987124-0-29013";"So, there are quite a few Khaajiti here."
"204987124-0-29015";"How can we block the funnel?"
"204987124-0-29016";"Are you sure it's harmless?"
"204987124-0-29017";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-29019";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-29020";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-29021";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-29023";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-29024";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-29025";"Rewards?"
"204987124-0-29027";"What's involved in becoming a member?"
"204987124-0-29028";"Yes, I wish to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-29030";"The Wilderking was once a mortal, as were you. His name was Ostion."
"204987124-0-29033";"Ostion fought the Valenwood. You were among many who died."
"204987124-0-29034";"Ostion and Valenwood remade you."
"204987124-0-29035";"You were the Wilderking's first creations and his most beloved."
"204987124-0-29036";"You are the master to which the Hollow are only copies."
"204987124-0-29037";"The Artisan's never targeted the bank?"
"204987124-0-29038";"I'm helping you, so I'd appreciate your help. Tell me what you know."
"204987124-0-29042";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-29044";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-29045";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-29046";"What can you tell me about Molag Grunda?"
"204987124-0-29047";"What can you tell me about Molag Grunda?"
"204987124-0-29048";"Why do you know so much about Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-29050";"All right. I'll talk to the general."
"204987124-0-29051";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-29053";"Tell me or I'll sic the guards on you for obstruction of justice."
"204987124-0-29054";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-29066";"I'll talk to Darius, then."
"204987124-0-29067";"Just tell me how to enter the tower."
"204987124-0-29069";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-29070";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-29073";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-29074";"He lost every artifact you lent him in a drunken stupor. I just finished recovering them."
"204987124-0-29075";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-29077";"How do you know the Artisan is a Bosmer?"
"204987124-0-29078";"A message? May I see it?"
"204987124-0-29079";"This is written on vellum?"
"204987124-0-29080";"This is written on vellum?"
"204987124-0-29081";"The message isn't useful to you, but I need it."
"204987124-0-29083";"Why do you think that?"
"204987124-0-29085";"Why did you steal from the Altmer?"
"204987124-0-29086";"So where are the valuables?"
"204987124-0-29088";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-29092";"What's going on?"
"204987124-0-29093";"And that's what you intended to do with the Altmer you robbed?"
"204987124-0-29094";"Why do you have a grudge against the Altmer?"
"204987124-0-29095";"So you planned to use this Right on the Altmer you robbed?"
"204987124-0-29096";"What's this Right of Theft?"
"204987124-0-29097";"How did the victims react?"
"204987124-0-29101";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-29105";"Are the Colovians still causing trouble?"
"204987124-0-29106";"I was at Senalana. I'm sorry about Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-29107";"Do you think she'll make a good Mane?"
"204987124-0-29108";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-29109";"Do you think she'll make a good Mane?"
"204987124-0-29110";"Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?"
"204987124-0-29111";"Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?"
"204987124-0-29112";"Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?"
"204987124-0-29113";"How did this all begin?"
"204987124-0-29114";"Have you had a chance to speak to Shazah?"
"204987124-0-29116";"I have the gate key. Let's rescue the mages."
"204987124-0-29117";"<<1>> is guarding our retreat. The way should be clear."
"204987124-0-29119";"All right. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-29122";"Keep moving, it must be weakening."
"204987124-0-29123";"Are there any other options?"
"204987124-0-29124";"I will help. What do I do?"
"204987124-0-29126";"Off the cliff then."
"204987124-0-29136";"What?"
"204987124-0-29137";"You're the dead one, not me."
"204987124-0-29138";"You seem very confused."
"204987124-0-29141";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-29142";"How can you just teleport around like this?"
"204987124-0-29143";"Who have we lost?"
"204987124-0-29144";"Who have we lost?"
"204987124-0-29148";"I'll see it done, Shazah."

"204987124-0-29151";"Yes. Let's go find Prince Azah."
"204987124-0-29152";"Who's behind this?"
"204987124-0-29153";"It's more than spiders. They were taken by a spider Daedra."
"204987124-0-29155";"You don't remember anything? Even <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29158";"Do you think we'll ever get Khali out of there?"
"204987124-0-29160";"What else can you tell me about the Elder Scrolls themselves?"
"204987124-0-29161";"How do we capture the enemy's Elder Scrolls?"
"204987124-0-29162";"What then?"
"204987124-0-29163";"Why are the Elder Scrolls kept in temples?"

"204987124-0-29168";"Who's behind this?"
"204987124-0-29169";"Do you think we'll ever get Shazah out of there?"
"204987124-0-29170";"I'll untie you and then be on my way."
"204987124-0-29172";"All right. I'll untie you first then."
"204987124-0-29173";"When did you recognize her?"
"204987124-0-29174";"Did you know Shiri before?"
"204987124-0-29175";"Did you know Shiri before?"
"204987124-0-29179";"No. I found her cousin's journal, which revealed who she was."
"204987124-0-29180";"Why would Shiri leave Ansei Maja's Ward here?"
"204987124-0-29181";"Why would Shiri leave Ansei Maja's Ward here?"
"204987124-0-29182";"How do I repair?"
"204987124-0-29187";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-29191";"I found your notes."
"204987124-0-29192";"But why did you marry him?"
"204987124-0-29193";"You're more than a simple groundskeeper, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-29195";"Why haven't you helped us before this?"
"204987124-0-29196";"I found your notes."
"204987124-0-29199";"How did a tough guy like you get captured?"
"204987124-0-29200";"How did a tough guy like you get captured?"
"204987124-0-29201";"Are all these prisoners from the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-29202";"You used me?"
"204987124-0-29203";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-29204";"Can I ask you something else first?"
"204987124-0-29205";"That sounds like a one-way trip."
"204987124-0-29206";"If we enter the vortex, what happens to our army?"
"204987124-0-29208";"But won't they die as well when we destroy the planar vortex?"
"204987124-0-29209";"Why does the great Meridia need my help?"
"204987124-0-29212";"Is this just a game to you?"
"204987124-0-29213";"Who were the Ra Gada?"
"204987124-0-29217";"Then may your journey to the Far Shores be peaceful."
"204987124-0-29219";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-29220";"Was he successful?"
"204987124-0-29224";"What happens once we destroy the last anchor?"
"204987124-0-29226";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-29227";"I'm taking you to the authorities."
"204987124-0-29232";"I'll think about it. Let's go."
"204987124-0-29234";"Tell me about rams."
"204987124-0-29236";"Tell me about Elengil."
"204987124-0-29237";"What can you tell me about the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29238";"How does his blood run through the land?"
"204987124-0-29239";"Why fight over Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-29240";"What do you do here in Bramblebreach?"
"204987124-0-29241";"Your brother was taken by a dark spirit. I was forced to kill him."
"204987124-0-29242";"All right. I'll help you."
"204987124-0-29244";"How long have you been hiding a harpy on your balcony?"
"204987124-0-29245";"What is my task?"
"204987124-0-29246";"His journal makes it sound like he saw it as a duty to hold it in the cave."
"204987124-0-29247";"Uh … he said he was going to … Vulkhel Guard. In Auridon."
"204987124-0-29250";"What? Are you afraid?"
"204987124-0-29252";"Why are you all here in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-29253";"Why would he have to eat her, though?"
"204987124-0-29262";"I seek recruits for the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-29263";"What if we send the guilds to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-29264";"Can you tell me more about the contract?"
"204987124-0-29265";"Unthrappa?"
"204987124-0-29266";"The Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-29268";"Both guilds have experience fighting Daedra. They may be our best chance."
"204987124-0-29270";"So it's all right for Pircalmo to remove the trees, but not you?"
"204987124-0-29271";"Why a mage, though? Couldn't anyone clear those trees?"
"204987124-0-29272";"You mentioned something about a Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-29273";"Send the guilds into Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-29274";"Do we have a choice? I don't see any other options."
"204987124-0-29277";"We could send the guilds into Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-29278";"If we can't trust the other alliances, what other option do we have?"
"204987124-0-29282";"So, what is the Guardian's Eye?"
"204987124-0-29285";"So, what is the Guardian's Eye?"
"204987124-0-29286";"This letter proves he's sent travelers to be ambushed by bandits."
"204987124-0-29287";"Tell me about the Wilderking."
"204987124-0-29293";"Where are you headed?"
"204987124-0-29294";"He came peacefully."
"204987124-0-29295";"Perhaps."
"204987124-0-29303";"Ranneth has some concerns about Pircalmo, and suggested I talk to you."
"204987124-0-29306";"Reverse the energy flow. Got it."
"204987124-0-29308";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-29309";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-29310";"Reverse the energy flow. Got it."
"204987124-0-29312";"What makes you think there's treasure inside?"
"204987124-0-29314";"You met the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29315";"You met the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29316";"Why is this village called Bramblebreach?"
"204987124-0-29317";"What did your grandmother tell you about the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29318";"Tell me about when you met the Wilderking."
"204987124-0-29319";"What did he look like?"
"204987124-0-29321";"The breach in the bramble."
"204987124-0-29322";"What did your grandmother tell you about the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29323";"Very well. I'll head to the Guardian's Skull."
"204987124-0-29324";"I just need one heartwood fragment."
"204987124-0-29325";"Do you know where I can find some hoarvor chitin?"
"204987124-0-29326";"I just need one heartwood fragment."
"204987124-0-29327";"What ingredients?"
"204987124-0-29329";"How do you know these are gifts from the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-29336";"What is my task?"
"204987124-0-29339";"What makes a good racing lizard?"
"204987124-0-29340";"Well, I'll buy that lizard snack for my racer."
"204987124-0-29342";"Are they feuding?"
"204987124-0-29347";"How long has <<1>> owned this track?"
"204987124-0-29348";"Are they feuding?"
"204987124-0-29352";"What can we do to stop them?"
"204987124-0-29353";"I'll go speak with General Thoda right away."
"204987124-0-29354";"I'll go speak with General Thoda right away."
"204987124-0-29356";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-29358";"Let's get out of here."
"204987124-0-29359";"You don't need to memorize them, do you?"
"204987124-0-29361";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-29364";"I'm not sure I've ever heard of those before."
"204987124-0-29367";"I'll be right back."
"204987124-0-29369";"A spirit led me to this in an old crypt. Thibaut's Cairn?"
"204987124-0-29378";"I can actually see her behind you now. She's playing along with you."
"204987124-0-29380";"I'll see it done. Good luck, Pircalmo."
"204987124-0-29386";"Who is Valaste, again?"
"204987124-0-29387";"What are you?"
"204987124-0-29388";"Why is the altar here?"
"204987124-0-29389";"Why are you down here?"
"204987124-0-29390";"Then how do we get in?"
"204987124-0-29391";"I will do everything I can to recover the Ansei Wards."
"204987124-0-29394";"What are you?"
"204987124-0-29396";"It's worth a try. Let's do it."
"204987124-0-29398";"How did you end up in the tower?"
"204987124-0-29399";"Where am I?"
"204987124-0-29400";"Saying their farewells?"
"204987124-0-29401";"What happened to the others?"
"204987124-0-29403";"What do you want of me?"
"204987124-0-29404";"All right. Let's go then."
"204987124-0-29407";"What can you tell me about this game?"
"204987124-0-29411";"Why does someone like you agree to play this game?"
"204987124-0-29413";"You expect that to win me over?"
"204987124-0-29417";"You should get to safety."
"204987124-0-29418";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-29420";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-29421";"Who is that on the ground?"
"204987124-0-29422";"Tell me about Bounty missions."

"204987124-0-29429";"What are Battle missions?"
"204987124-0-29430";"What are Battle missions?"
"204987124-0-29431";"How about Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-29432";"How can the links be broken?"
"204987124-0-29436";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-29438";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-29439";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-29440";"I killed his brother, Uwafa, at Tu'whacca's Throne."
"204987124-0-29442";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-29445";"And you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-29447";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-29448";"Asylum? Are you joking?"
"204987124-0-29449";"Will you come to us?"
"204987124-0-29450";"How can I be sure this isn't a trick?"
"204987124-0-29452";"I can see your point."
"204987124-0-29456";"What does a Docent do?"
"204987124-0-29458";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-29459";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-29461";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-29462";"I'll take them all. Otherwise, I'll just keep killing you and disrupting your game."
"204987124-0-29463";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-29464";"I'll take them all. Otherwise, I'll just keep killing you and disrupting your game."

"204987124-0-29479";"I'll feed an elder spider."
"204987124-0-29481";"How do I repair?"
"204987124-0-29482";"I'll repair a siege engine then talk to Galsi."
"204987124-0-29488";"They don't trust each other."
"204987124-0-29489";"I did."
"204987124-0-29491";"To lead the people I rescued back to the city."
"204987124-0-29492";"How do I repair?"
"204987124-0-29496";"A storm? Vanus, what's wrong?"
"204987124-0-29506";"I think that's all I need to know about the Elder Scrolls."
"204987124-0-29508";"What then?"
"204987124-0-29509";"Why are the Elder Scrolls kept in temples?"

"204987124-0-29527";"<<1>> suspects murder."
"204987124-0-29529";"Could I help?"
"204987124-0-29530";"I was hoping you could tell me."
"204987124-0-29532";"Where should I begin?"
"204987124-0-29533";"Who is this Watch Captain?"
"204987124-0-29534";"Very well. I'll find the source of the storms."
"204987124-0-29536";"What about Hjorik?"
"204987124-0-29538";"<<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29539";"<<1>> said it was to improve their crops."
"204987124-0-29542";"You think Bruma's misery is the will of the gods?"
"204987124-0-29543";"I don't believe so."
"204987124-0-29545";"So what's he doing here?"
"204987124-0-29546";"Go on."
"204987124-0-29547";"So he murdered Ihlqub?"
"204987124-0-29548";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-29549";"A sad tale, but what do you know of the blade itself?"
"204987124-0-29556";"Would the Fighters Guild be willing to invade Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-29558";"The guilds can lead the attack, but only if all three leaders agree."
"204987124-0-29560";"Hjorik seems to think you'll recover."
"204987124-0-29563";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-29564";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-29565";"All right, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-29572";"Hidden Armigers?"
"204987124-0-29573";"Ring of Daggers?"

"204987124-0-29580";"Where is this?"
"204987124-0-29582";"I'll return as soon as I can."

"204987124-0-29585";"I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-29586";"Who are you two, exactly?"
"204987124-0-29587";"[Lie] I'm a Dominion soldier who survived the shipwreck."
"204987124-0-29588";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-29589";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-29590";"Why are you helping me?"
"204987124-0-29591";"I found this pendant. Is it yours?"
"204987124-0-29593";"Is there no hope for Bruma?"
"204987124-0-29594";"Is there no hope for Bruma?"

"204987124-0-29597";"I found this pendant in the Cave of Trophies."
"204987124-0-29601";"What if they never arrive?"
"204987124-0-29603";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-29605";"Why stay?"
"204987124-0-29607";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-29610";"No one else is sitting around reading."
"204987124-0-29612";"So why are you here?"
"204987124-0-29613";"You're leaving?"
"204987124-0-29615";"Will you help me in the coming battle?"
"204987124-0-29616";"You think there's still hope?"
"204987124-0-29617";"You think there's still hope?"
"204987124-0-29620";"Why are you here by yourself?"
"204987124-0-29622";"Do you stay out here all the time?"
"204987124-0-29635";"What can you tell me about Hectahame?"
"204987124-0-29636";"What can you tell me about Hectahame?"
"204987124-0-29645";"What could cause that?"
"204987124-0-29647";"I'll meet you at the summit."
"204987124-0-29651";"Who's <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29652";"Your name is Forest-Child?"
"204987124-0-29653";"What can you tell me about the Khajiit merchant, <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29655";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-29656";"Why do they call you Forest-Child?"
"204987124-0-29657";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-29658";"I'd like to hear about Scouting missions."

"204987124-0-29664";"<<1>> asked me to send anyone I found to the mouth of this cave."
"204987124-0-29670";"But you were able to escape?"
"204987124-0-29671";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-29672";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-29673";"Tell me about Battle missions."
"204987124-0-29674";"How can the links between forts be broken?"
"204987124-0-29678";"Why don't you come with us?"
"204987124-0-29682";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-29683";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-29685";"What was Valenwood like when you were last here?"
"204987124-0-29687";"Where do you want me?"
"204987124-0-29688";"Where do you want me?"
"204987124-0-29689";"Take care."
"204987124-0-29695";"Stonefang?"

"204987124-0-29727";"Has he spoken at all about how the sanctuary was lost?"
"204987124-0-29728";"Valaste, are you enjoying this more than you're letting on?"
"204987124-0-29729";"Do you know anything about where I'm going?"
"204987124-0-29733";"Who are these hostages they're holding?"
"204987124-0-29736";"Why fight over Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-29743";"Very well. I will read this book for you."
"204987124-0-29744";"What's your grudge against the Altmer?"
"204987124-0-29746";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-29748";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-29749";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."

"204987124-0-29776";"What's the other thing?"
"204987124-0-29777";"You're in love with a Dark Elf?"
"204987124-0-29780";"Strange? How so?"
"204987124-0-29781";"No, I mean, why did you come here?"
"204987124-0-29785";"How do I repair?"
"204987124-0-29789";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-29791";"Such as?"
"204987124-0-29793";"We'll find a way in."
"204987124-0-29795";"Let's face him."
"204987124-0-29797";"I saved as many as I could."
"204987124-0-29800";"You should come along. It might be good for you."
"204987124-0-29801";"Let's go!"
"204987124-0-29803";"Good luck, Sir Cadwell."
"204987124-0-29807";"Why haven't you collected these things already?"
"204987124-0-29808";"How can we find the responsible party?"
"204987124-0-29809";"I'll find the evidence of the pact breaker."
"204987124-0-29810";"If Rilis is so dangerous, why free him?"
"204987124-0-29811";"Tell me about High Kinlord Rilis."
"204987124-0-29813";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-29814";"Tell me about High Kinlord Rilis."
"204987124-0-29815";"How did you make it past the traps?"
"204987124-0-29818";"I'll set out at once and meet you there."
"204987124-0-29820";"I'll set out at once and meet you there."
"204987124-0-29822";"Can he do that?"
"204987124-0-29823";"What do you mean by practical applications? What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-29824";"How do we stop him?"
"204987124-0-29826";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-29827";"What's his plan?"
"204987124-0-29829";"We gather power from the Atronachs? How?"
"204987124-0-29831";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-29832";"I'll see it done, Khali."
"204987124-0-29834";"Why didn't you try to help the patrons?"
"204987124-0-29835";"Why didn't you try to help the patrons?"
"204987124-0-29836";"Can you help these people get to the Hollow City?"
"204987124-0-29842";"Cinnar sent me to retrieve the stolen goods."
"204987124-0-29844";"How about we go to Cinnar?"
"204987124-0-29845";"What if you take me to this Cinnar?"
"204987124-0-29846";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29847";"Talk to Skordo, got it. Anything else before I go?"
"204987124-0-29852";"How will a reanimated rat lift your friend's spirits?"
"204987124-0-29853";"Well, I'll bring the parts to you here."
"204987124-0-29854";"What's he planning?"
"204987124-0-29858";"I'm here to stop <<1>>."
"204987124-0-29863";"Our mutual friend thought you could use my help."
"204987124-0-29864";"You're not coming with me?"
"204987124-0-29867";"Good luck, Khali."
"204987124-0-29868";"I'll find the Guildhall and close the portal."
"204987124-0-29869";"You want me to ask them for a copy of the treaty?"
"204987124-0-29870";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-29873";"Let's go to Driladan Pass."
"204987124-0-29874";"Let's go to Dread Vullain."
"204987124-0-29875";"Let's go to Hectahame."
"204987124-0-29878";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-29891";"<Walk away. Protect the books.>"
"204987124-0-29893";"What did you do, Pellingare?"
"204987124-0-29894";"I met your children when they were alive. This is how they were."
"204987124-0-29895";"Either way, you have to help me stop them."
"204987124-0-29897";"How can we stop him?"
"204987124-0-29898";"Could they be spying on the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-29899";"I'll see what I can learn."
"204987124-0-29900";"What kind of help do you need?"
"204987124-0-29901";"Do you feel that strongly about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29902";"And what about <<1>> the Merchant?"
"204987124-0-29903";"What about her husband, <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29904";"Where can we find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29908";"What happened to your Guildmates?"
"204987124-0-29910";"Can you teach me?"
"204987124-0-29911";"I'll defend you."
"204987124-0-29913";"She sent me to find you."
"204987124-0-29914";"That sounds a lot like what happened to Lyris."
"204987124-0-29915";"Very well."
"204987124-0-29917";"A full pardon? For what?"
"204987124-0-29918";"See you outside."
"204987124-0-29923";"Do you know if there are any portals left in the city?"
"204987124-0-29925";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-29926";"They already dug up <<1>>."
"204987124-0-29927";"<<1>> said you were raiders."
"204987124-0-29928";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-29930";"What will you do with the mutineers?"
"204987124-0-29931";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-29934";"I'll go speak with her."
"204987124-0-29935";"They're raising an army of skeletons."
"204987124-0-29937";"We need to wake the old bones before the Worm Cult does."
"204987124-0-29939";"What makes you so sure it was <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29942";"Very well."
"204987124-0-29944";"How do I hand skulls to a ghost?"
"204987124-0-29945";"I'll find the lever."
"204987124-0-29946";"Where is <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-29948";"What are your thoughts about <<1>> the merchant?"
"204987124-0-29949";"I see. What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29950";"And her husband, <<1>>, what about him?"
"204987124-0-29952";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-29955";"I'll meet you there, then."
"204987124-0-29957";"What comes next?"
"204987124-0-29959";"After you, Khali."
"204987124-0-29961";"Tell me about the Dominion."
"204987124-0-29962";"Have you had any dealings with <<1>>, the merchant?"
"204987124-0-29963";"And <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29964";"Actually, I'd like to hear your thoughts on <<1>> the merchant."
"204987124-0-29965";"I see. How about the merchant, <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-29967";"How do I track the mammoth?"
"204987124-0-29970";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-29972";"Do you think I'll see you again?"
"204987124-0-29973";"What do you do, Raz?"
"204987124-0-29974";"Who is this Watch Captain?"
"204987124-0-29975";"What do you do, Raz?"
"204987124-0-29976";"Signed up with the Queen?"
"204987124-0-29977";"What is the Moon Hallowed?"
"204987124-0-29978";"Can you tell me more about Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-29979";"I'll give the evidence to the captain when I see her."
"204987124-0-29980";"I'm to help an Advisor Norion. Do you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-29981";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-29983";"You going to let me out of here?"
"204987124-0-29984";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-29985";"If the Eyes are the most-trusted agents of the Queen, what about the marines?"
"204987124-0-29986";"Where am I?"
"204987124-0-29989";"Where am I?"
"204987124-0-29990";"Are you certain <<1>> has the stolen treaty?"
"204987124-0-29991";"Why me?"
"204987124-0-29993";"How can you be sure that Bakkhara still lives?"
"204987124-0-29994";"You can't see me?"
"204987124-0-29995";"Save your strength, King Dynar."
"204987124-0-29996";"We stopped the Planemeld."
"204987124-0-29998";"Bakkhara and I freed you from a Daedric realm."
"204987124-0-29999";"Set Kargand free, or there will be consequences."
"204987124-0-30004";"What happened to Darien?"
"204987124-0-30006";"Are we the only ones left?"
"204987124-0-30008";"I'm ready to go home."
"204987124-0-30009";"Who are these others?"
"204987124-0-30011";"Why so secretive?"
"204987124-0-30012";"Who are these others?"
"204987124-0-30014";"When you first appeared to me in Coldharbour, you spoke of my destiny."
"204987124-0-30015";"Who are the Five Companions?"
"204987124-0-30016";"Why did Varen want to be Dragonborn?"
"204987124-0-30017";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-30018";"So, what's our next move?"
"204987124-0-30019";"Pellingare deserves death. I will look the other way."
"204987124-0-30024";"I need more time to decide."
"204987124-0-30025";"Pellingare deserves death. I will look the other way."
"204987124-0-30026";"There has to be a Moon Hallowed."
"204987124-0-30027";"The Path?"
"204987124-0-30028";"What is the Moon Hallowed?"
"204987124-0-30029";"What is it? Where is it?"
"204987124-0-30030";"What is the Moon Hallowed?"
"204987124-0-30031";"What should I do with these relics?"
"204987124-0-30032";"You don't read the books?"
"204987124-0-30033";"I ask <<1>> to stand in testimony."
"204987124-0-30034";"I ask <<1>> to stand in testimony."
"204987124-0-30035";"I ask <<1>> to stand in testimony."
"204987124-0-30039";"The Outsider?"
"204987124-0-30041";"I'm ready."

"204987124-0-30043";"Gathiel's diary, detailing the intention to acquire Sanguine Alendil to cure an illness."
"204987124-0-30044";"What are you serving?"
"204987124-0-30045";"How do you make it?"
"204987124-0-30046";"What does Nirnroot wine taste like?"
"204987124-0-30047";"Competitors?"
"204987124-0-30050";"Who are these charlatans?"
"204987124-0-30054";"Who are these charlatans?"
"204987124-0-30055";"What does Nirnroot wine taste like?"
"204987124-0-30056";"We need to rescue Sai Sahan. Can you get us to the Halls of Torment?"
"204987124-0-30057";"A prison in Coldharbour called the Halls of Torment."
"204987124-0-30058";"Is there anything else?"
"204987124-0-30061";"But you can find a path to the Halls of Torment, can't you?"
"204987124-0-30062";"I found this sword in a crypt near Sanguine Barrows."
"204987124-0-30064";"I think she wants you to have her sword."
"204987124-0-30066";"How do I drive them away?"
"204987124-0-30067";"All right. I guess I can help, but you'll owe me."
"204987124-0-30068";"Of course."
"204987124-0-30069";"So why don't you leave?"
"204987124-0-30070";"A High Elf woman? You mean Aranias?"
"204987124-0-30074";"What else can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-30075";"What do you want from me?"

"204987124-0-30085";"I'm ready. What do I do now?"
"204987124-0-30086";"I wish to join Brackenleaf's Briars."
"204987124-0-30087";"Can you open a portal to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-30090";"What does she teach?"
"204987124-0-30091";"Yes, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-30096";"Perhaps this attack will convince the leaders to cooperate."

"204987124-0-30114";"What is the Outsider?"
"204987124-0-30115";"What happened to the master Briars?"
"204987124-0-30121";"Why do you have to do this now?"
"204987124-0-30122";"So you'll fight in the initial assault?"
"204987124-0-30124";"I'll take any help I can get."
"204987124-0-30126";"Is it safe for me to go down there?"

"204987124-0-30143";"How do you plan on helping?"
"204987124-0-30145";"I found your wife's journal. She left you for a vampire. [Tell truth.]"
"204987124-0-30149";"What was this oath?"
"204987124-0-30150";"Why did you join the Briars?"
"204987124-0-30151";"So no one's ever tasted Nirnroot wine?"
"204987124-0-30152";"But you didn't shave your beard."
"204987124-0-30153";"If they were already cursed, maybe Samsi was under their influence."

"204987124-0-30167";"Which way are we heading?"
"204987124-0-30168";"Couldn't it be grabbed in battle?"

"204987124-0-30183";"What else can you tell me about Nirnroot wine?"
"204987124-0-30184";"Then let us not keep him waiting."
"204987124-0-30186";"Shouldn't a prince be afforded a little more respect?"
"204987124-0-30187";"Then let us keep him waiting no longer."
"204987124-0-30188";"Why must we fight the Elves?"

"204987124-0-30267";"All right. I'll visit the shrines and hear what the masters have to say."
"204987124-0-30268";"What could have caused it?"

"204987124-0-30295";"When did the Briars arrive?"
"204987124-0-30298";"So you would just have us flee?"
"204987124-0-30299";"I'll have to think about it."
"204987124-0-30301";"I'll look for Areldur."

"204987124-0-30329";"What are you suggesting?"
"204987124-0-30332";"I am honored to join you as the last member of the Five Companions."
"204987124-0-30333";"How can I help you?"

"204987124-0-30365";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-30366";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-30368";"Erunor probably stayed at the Fading Tree because he's the new caretaker."
"204987124-0-30369";"It's the same substance that's contaminated the johads."
"204987124-0-30370";"Could someone have stolen it from you?"
"204987124-0-30371";"You'll be fine, Haqmir. I'll wait here."
"204987124-0-30372";"I've made up my mind. Don't worry, you'll make a fine king."
"204987124-0-30373";"Then we must collect the ring and leave quickly."
"204987124-0-30375";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-30376";"I love you too, Haqmir, and it's all right. True honor need not be named."
"204987124-0-30377";"You are truly noble, Haqmir. I'm sorry you must be exiled."
"204987124-0-30378";"What personal item can I locate for you?"
"204987124-0-30380";"Do you know anything else that can help me?"
"204987124-0-30382";"We may not get another chance. What did you want to talk about?"
"204987124-0-30385";"There's a war to win. I intend to take up the fight in Cyrodiil."
"204987124-0-30386";"Are you serious?"
"204987124-0-30387";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-30388";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-30390";"I have no regrets."
"204987124-0-30392";"Sure."
"204987124-0-30393";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-30394";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-30395";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-30401";"What else is on your mind?"
"204987124-0-30402";"What do you need from me?"
"204987124-0-30405";"I'll drink to that!"
"204987124-0-30406";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-30407";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-30408";"Sure."
"204987124-0-30409";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-30411";"What's the reward?"
"204987124-0-30412";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-30413";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-30416";"There's the same musk all over the house."
"204987124-0-30417";"I have a lizard that can track the scent."
"204987124-0-30418";"Who are you and why do you care about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-30419";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-30421";"What's the reward?"
"204987124-0-30422";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-30423";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-30424";"Why?"
"204987124-0-30428";"I think you should own the johads."
"204987124-0-30429";"You'll keep the johads then?"
"204987124-0-30430";"I think you should own the johads."
"204987124-0-30431";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-30432";"Family? Does that mean your brother is staying?"
"204987124-0-30434";"Your sister? I thought you hated each other."
"204987124-0-30436";"The Reachmen are no longer a threat. The Imperials are the greatest danger now."
"204987124-0-30437";"Why did Kasura hide the ring here?"
"204987124-0-30438";"Is that your way of thanking me?"
"204987124-0-30439";"The Planemeld has been stopped. Isn't that enough?"
"204987124-0-30440";"Is it even possible to defeat Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-30441";"What then?"
"204987124-0-30442";"Go on."
"204987124-0-30443";"How?"
"204987124-0-30444";"There always is."
"204987124-0-30445";"Won't that just cause another Soulburst?"
"204987124-0-30446";"If his bones slept, why do you hate him?"
"204987124-0-30447";"What did they do?"
"204987124-0-30448";"Who are the Black Daggers?"
"204987124-0-30449";"Someone has to die?"
"204987124-0-30451";"No. The price is too high."
"204987124-0-30452";"Why did Reezal-Jul attack Crestshade?"
"204987124-0-30456";"How did Mannimarco find out about this valley?"
"204987124-0-30459";"We'll stop Mannimarco."
"204987124-0-30460";"Did <<1>> ask them to seek you out?"
"204987124-0-30461";"But first, the Planemeld must be stopped."
"204987124-0-30462";"I'll find a way."
"204987124-0-30465";"I only want to help you."
"204987124-0-30468";"I'll look for Imiril."
"204987124-0-30469";"How will I return?"
"204987124-0-30470";"You don't think it's strange the moon priest knew you'd be here?"
"204987124-0-30471";"Where am I supposed to go?"
"204987124-0-30473";"I'll tell him what happened."
"204987124-0-30475";"Where is Hackdirt?"
"204987124-0-30479";"<<1>> wants to stop the Worm Cult. Why not let him help?"
"204987124-0-30483";"He came here to stand with his family against invaders. Is it justice you seek, or vengeance?"
"204987124-0-30484";"Yes."
"204987124-0-30485";"<<1>> wants to stop the Worm Cult. Why not let him help?"
"204987124-0-30487";"So? What am I supposed to do?"
"204987124-0-30492";"<<A:1>> isn't dead."
"204987124-0-30493";"Really?"
"204987124-0-30496";"Break the stones? Sounds easy. What's the problem?"
"204987124-0-30497";"Do you need help?"
"204987124-0-30498";"What exactly is a johad?"
"204987124-0-30500";"How can we stop him?"
"204987124-0-30501";"The new caretaker hasn't been selected yet?"
"204987124-0-30507";"<<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30508";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30510";"Is it that bad?"
"204987124-0-30511";"What is it that he wants us to do?"
"204987124-0-30512";"What will that accomplish?"
"204987124-0-30514";"All right. I have my orders then."
"204987124-0-30516";"Where are his original bones?"
"204987124-0-30517";"You just accepted your fate on blind faith?"
"204987124-0-30519";"The king said he already sent orders to Captain Taern."
"204987124-0-30520";"You mentioned <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30523";"Are you going to confront the king?"
"204987124-0-30524";"All right. I'll go deal with the King's Guard."
"204987124-0-30525";"How did this woman know to tell you this?"
"204987124-0-30526";"You just accepted your fate on blind faith?"
"204987124-0-30527";"You just accepted your fate on blind faith?"
"204987124-0-30528";"Something had to be done."
"204987124-0-30529";"You have to tell me what exactly bothers you about this."
"204987124-0-30530";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-30531";"What about the village's oath to the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-30532";"I'll talk to him about it."
"204987124-0-30535";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-30536";"This key came with the journal."
"204987124-0-30539";"The wyrd sisters are protecting your friends."
"204987124-0-30540";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-30543";"Won't that be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-30545";"How do we turn poison into something funny?"
"204987124-0-30546";"How do I get there?"
"204987124-0-30547";"What do you think Shiri is planning?"
"204987124-0-30548";"What do you think Shiri is planning?"
"204987124-0-30549";"What do you think Shiri is planning?"
"204987124-0-30558";"I'll bury your personal items."
"204987124-0-30560";"Then why are you here?"
"204987124-0-30563";"Isn't it dangerous?"
"204987124-0-30564";"Well, no."
"204987124-0-30568";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-30570";"The way is clear to the mill. You'll find safety there."
"204987124-0-30583";"Are you sure Falisa hasn't forgotten you?"
"204987124-0-30584";"How did you find this place?"
"204987124-0-30585";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-30587";"I'll go speak with him."
"204987124-0-30590";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-30591";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-30592";"What can we expect?"
"204987124-0-30593";"Represents something?"
"204987124-0-30594";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-30595";"This will be dangerous, right?"
"204987124-0-30596";"How did you become cursed?"
"204987124-0-30598";"You mentioned an Argonian?"
"204987124-0-30599";"Did you see this abomination?"
"204987124-0-30600";"How long has Sai Sahan been a prisoner there?"
"204987124-0-30602";"[Choose Abnur] Come with me, Abnur."
"204987124-0-30606";"Is there any way to reverse the curse?"
"204987124-0-30611";"[Choose Lyris] I want you by my side, Lyris."
"204987124-0-30612";"Of course not."
"204987124-0-30615";"What was that about being a sword-singer?"
"204987124-0-30616";"Where's the farm?"
"204987124-0-30617";"Why are some spirits, like you, more aware and able to speak?"
"204987124-0-30618";"Do you think there are other survivors?"
"204987124-0-30619";"And then what happens?"
"204987124-0-30620";"Why?"
"204987124-0-30621";"Is that when the shades appeared?"
"204987124-0-30624";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-30625";"Where are the Wood Orcs camped?"
"204987124-0-30641";"Why is this place called the Orchard?"
"204987124-0-30642";"What were you, before you died?"
"204987124-0-30643";"You fell asleep?"
"204987124-0-30644";"What were you, before you died?"
"204987124-0-30645";"The city was gone?"
"204987124-0-30648";"How did you come to be here?"
"204987124-0-30649";"How long have you been a skeleton?"
"204987124-0-30650";"Why would they throw out a talking skull?"
"204987124-0-30651";"What creature?"
"204987124-0-30652";"What were you, before you died?"
"204987124-0-30653";"What exactly do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-30654";"All right, I'll test your theory."
"204987124-0-30656";"What are you suggesting?"
"204987124-0-30658";"I'll go speak with him."
"204987124-0-30660";"How do you know <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30661";"And how will the spell pacify the vampires?"
"204987124-0-30662";"What's a spinner?"
"204987124-0-30665";"You can tell the future?"
"204987124-0-30666";"You can tell the future?"
"204987124-0-30668";"All right. I'll consider it."
"204987124-0-30669";"I understand. Wait here and I will return."
"204987124-0-30670";"Is that why you attacked the Mages Guild acolytes?"
"204987124-0-30671";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-30672";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-30674";"Then I'll do what I can to set you free."
"204987124-0-30675";"Jealousy?"
"204987124-0-30676";"So these spirits will attack me?"
"204987124-0-30677";"What if I manage to slay them?"
"204987124-0-30678";"I understand."
"204987124-0-30679";"Can we destroy the Heart?"
"204987124-0-30680";"And how will the spell pacify the vampires?"
"204987124-0-30681";"You think whatever was in this vial is in the johads?"
"204987124-0-30684";"You won't have to. <<1>> returned him to his bones."
"204987124-0-30686";"And what is that?"
"204987124-0-30688";"This curse is your responsibility. You cannot place the burden on others."
"204987124-0-30690";"I return your sword, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-30692";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30694";"How do we reinforce the lock?"
"204987124-0-30695";"How can you keep me safe?"
"204987124-0-30696";"Where are these special rooms?"
"204987124-0-30699";"You know exactly where it is. You've been sending people there."
"204987124-0-30700";"I've come to talk about Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-30701";"Molag Bal's influence grows. It's time we took the fight to his realm."
"204987124-0-30703";"I propose all the alliances meet on the island of Stirk, to discuss an assault on Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-30708";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-30710";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-30713";"All right, patience it is."
"204987124-0-30716";"No. Just a lot of snakes."
"204987124-0-30717";"Not so fast."
"204987124-0-30720";"No. You must face justice."
"204987124-0-30723";"For how long?"
"204987124-0-30724";"How about Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-30725";"So there are no hard feelings between you?"
"204987124-0-30726";"Fifty years?"
"204987124-0-30729";"Why were the bones sealed?"
"204987124-0-30735";"I didn't see a skull."
"204987124-0-30736";"Is it really Y'ffre's skull?"
"204987124-0-30737";"Whose skull is it?"
"204987124-0-30739";"I'd like to hear about Scouting missions."
"204987124-0-30740";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-30741";"Tell me more about the Reaver Citadel."
"204987124-0-30742";"I'd like to hear about Scouting missions."
"204987124-0-30743";"You don't want it back?"
"204987124-0-30744";"You sold a cursed axe to the Orcs?"
"204987124-0-30745";"What do I do? Destroy it?"
"204987124-0-30747";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-30748";"They pulled the idea from Sai's head, didn't they?"
"204987124-0-30749";"And King Dynar's ready to move against it?"
"204987124-0-30750";"Did you notice anything else?"
"204987124-0-30751";"What kind of music?"
"204987124-0-30752";"<Place <<Az:1>>.>"
"204987124-0-30757";"You saw a shipyard?"
"204987124-0-30758";"You saw a shipyard?"
"204987124-0-30759";"Tell me more about the Reaver Citadel."
"204987124-0-30760";"Why didn't Musi protect you from the jackals?"
"204987124-0-30761";"What happens when she dies?"
"204987124-0-30762";"<Place <<Az:1>>.>"
"204987124-0-30767";"Whose bones do you inhabit?"
"204987124-0-30769";"They're your family?"
"204987124-0-30770";"<Place <<Az:1>>.>"
"204987124-0-30771";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-30779";"What do you bicker about?"
"204987124-0-30780";"Are they actually your family?"
"204987124-0-30782";"You're safe now."
"204987124-0-30783";"What's so special about the Barrowbough?"
"204987124-0-30784";"What does House Montclair hope to gain by all this?"
"204987124-0-30786";"So you were attacked?"
"204987124-0-30788";"Do you know where the ruin is?"
"204987124-0-30790";"How did it happen?"
"204987124-0-30791";"All right. I'll help the other guards and then meet you at the warehouse."
"204987124-0-30792";"I'll take care of those things. You go."
"204987124-0-30793";"<Place <<Az:1>>.>"
"204987124-0-30798";"Tell me more. Where are the Keepers, exactly?"
"204987124-0-30799";"You don't fear death?"
"204987124-0-30801";"It's time to take the offensive against Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-30802";"I propose a moot. A meeting of all three alliance leaders on the island of Stirk."
"204987124-0-30804";"It wanted to seal you away."
"204987124-0-30806";"Khajiit are your ""true people""?"
"204987124-0-30807";"She may have had important information to share."
"204987124-0-30809";"Whose skull is it, then?"
"204987124-0-30810";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-30812";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-30815";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-30816";"I'm going into the Orchard."
"204987124-0-30817";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-30818";"Go somewhere safe."
"204987124-0-30820";"It's dead now."
"204987124-0-30827";"All right. When I catch the red frog, I'll eat it alive."
"204987124-0-30829";"What do you need from me?"
"204987124-0-30830";"Very well. I'll face the High Kinlord."
"204987124-0-30832";"Will you be part of the Fighters Guild or Mages Guild forces?"
"204987124-0-30835";"I never turn down a challenge."
"204987124-0-30836";"I am."
"204987124-0-30837";"I am."
"204987124-0-30838";"I am."
"204987124-0-30839";"The Snake."
"204987124-0-30848";"The Snake."
"204987124-0-30851";"Do you have any ideas on how I can get inside the walls?"
"204987124-0-30854";"I'll look for Voranil."
"204987124-0-30855";"What should I expect?"
"204987124-0-30857";"I am ready to get started."
"204987124-0-30858";"<Take the ring.>"
"204987124-0-30860";"Waiting for what?"
"204987124-0-30863";"<Take the ring.>"
"204987124-0-30869";"<Fish out the object.>"
"204987124-0-30873";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-30874";"I want to know what I'm looking for."
"204987124-0-30876";"What else do we need?"
"204987124-0-30881";"I'll look for Imiril."
"204987124-0-30883";"You've heard of me?"
"204987124-0-30885";"I'm humbled, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-30886";"I've come to propose a meeting on the island of Stirk, to discuss an assault on Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-30891";"Why study Ayleids?"
"204987124-0-30893";"Apparently you were wrong."
"204987124-0-30895";"Why are you doing this?"
"204987124-0-30896";"Molag Bal has my soul. Is there a choice?"
"204987124-0-30897";"What didn't she understand?"
"204987124-0-30898";"I have <<Az:1>>."
"204987124-0-30899";"Why shouldn't I set your son's spirit free?"
"204987124-0-30900";"Why should I do that for you?"
"204987124-0-30901";"Yes, he has."
"204987124-0-30902";"Tell me again."
"204987124-0-30903";"Go on."
"204987124-0-30905";"And then?"
"204987124-0-30906";"Let's do this."
"204987124-0-30910";"How can I make your father sleep?"
"204987124-0-30911";"<<1>> returned to <<2>>. You could go there."
"204987124-0-30912";"Does it help?"
"204987124-0-30918";"How would it change the course of history?"
"204987124-0-30921";"I'll try to find a way to unlock the trap door."
"204987124-0-30922";"Not a problem. What now, Guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-30923";"Get out of here."
"204987124-0-30925";"Why not kick them out?"
"204987124-0-30927";"<<1>> was captured by pirates."
"204987124-0-30928";"I understand Montclair and Reezal-Jul's role in all this, but what about Lleraya?"
"204987124-0-30929";"What are we looking for here?"
"204987124-0-30930";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-30931";"What are we looking for again?"
"204987124-0-30934";"<<1>> was captured by pirates."
"204987124-0-30942";"Inducted into the village? What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-30944";"What exactly is Kerbol curing?"
"204987124-0-30945";"Who told you this?"
"204987124-0-30946";"Kerbol was trying to seal his form. I had to subdue him."
"204987124-0-30950";"The king isn't thinking clearly. It's your duty to protect him from himself, not the Orcs."
"204987124-0-30953";"Yes. He thinks that surrendering is a better option."
"204987124-0-30957";"Then we must find him, and quickly."
"204987124-0-30959";"Am I going alone?"
"204987124-0-30960";"Do you think she's behind this?"
"204987124-0-30961";"Can you tell me more of the province generals?"
"204987124-0-30963";"Thank you, Merric."
"204987124-0-30964";"Thank you, Merric."
"204987124-0-30965";"Thank you, Merric."
"204987124-0-30966";"Thank you, Merric."
"204987124-0-30967";"Did they force you to reveal the location of the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-30968";"And now?"
"204987124-0-30970";"Why do they want you back?"
"204987124-0-30973";"What do you do for a living?"
"204987124-0-30980";"I think we just met Mannimarco's Duchess of Anguish."
"204987124-0-30981";"Why did the doppelganger look like you?"
"204987124-0-30983";"You almost sound pleased about that."
"204987124-0-30985";"So, the doppelganger was using that failure to torment him?"
"204987124-0-30986";"Do you think they had a relationship?"
"204987124-0-30988";"I think we just met Mannimarco's Duchess of Anguish."
"204987124-0-30990";"Can you walk? We need to get out of here."
"204987124-0-30991";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-30993";"Why is Molag Bal keeping you here?"
"204987124-0-30994";"How does the dream end?"
"204987124-0-30995";"I'm here to defeat him and take my soul back."
"204987124-0-30997";"So be it."
"204987124-0-30998";"What is Brackenleaf's heart?"
"204987124-0-30999";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-31000";"Any idea what it all means?"
"204987124-0-31002";"The same to you."
"204987124-0-31004";"Don't beat yourself up about it. You're here and that's what matters."
"204987124-0-31005";"This dream you mentioned, how does it end?"
"204987124-0-31006";"This dream you mentioned, how does it end?"
"204987124-0-31007";"Where should I meet you?"
"204987124-0-31008";"Where should I meet you?"
"204987124-0-31009";"As you say, Aelif."
"204987124-0-31010";"As you say, Aelif."
"204987124-0-31011";"This dream you mentioned, how does it end?"
"204987124-0-31012";"This dream you mentioned, how does it end?"
"204987124-0-31017";"Where should I look for other survivors?"
"204987124-0-31024";"So what's the plan?"
"204987124-0-31025";"Can you tell me more about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31026";"So be it."
"204987124-0-31027";"And what's he doing out here?"
"204987124-0-31028";"Can he really sense <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31029";"Can you tell me more about Jonah Marose?"
"204987124-0-31030";"Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-31031";"That is?"
"204987124-0-31033";"I'm honored, Jofnir."
"204987124-0-31034";"I found some robes earlier while I was investigating the village."
"204987124-0-31041";"Do you really think we can win?"
"204987124-0-31045";"You still have time to get out of here before the final battle begins."
"204987124-0-31046";"You'll be safer in the barn with the other survivors."
"204987124-0-31049";"Stay safe, Raynor."
"204987124-0-31052";"We may not survive this battle."
"204987124-0-31053";"Will your people be all right in Valenwood?"
"204987124-0-31054";"That's a good sentiment."
"204987124-0-31055";"Will your people be all right in Valenwood?"
"204987124-0-31056";"We may not survive this battle."
"204987124-0-31057";"We may not survive this battle."
"204987124-0-31058";"Can you tell me more about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31059";"Yes, the Planemeld is a bad thing."
"204987124-0-31065";"I wield a longsword."
"204987124-0-31070";"I wield a longsword."
"204987124-0-31075";"I wield a longsword."
"204987124-0-31076";"When this is over, I'm going to make you try bread and honey."
"204987124-0-31077";"Aren't you concerned at all?"
"204987124-0-31078";"When this is over, I'm going to make you try bread and honey."
"204987124-0-31079";"We can't fail."
"204987124-0-31080";"What happens to the Mages Guild if we fail?"
"204987124-0-31081";"What happens to the Mages Guild if we fail?"
"204987124-0-31082";"That's why we'll win this fight."
"204987124-0-31083";"We can't fail."
"204987124-0-31084";"What were your people like?"
"204987124-0-31086";"You don't want her to know it's from you."
"204987124-0-31087";"What's the Cult of the Ancestor Moth?"
"204987124-0-31088";"All right, I'll give it to her."
"204987124-0-31090";"You disagreed with your people?"
"204987124-0-31092";"I remember you. You were at the battle against Faolchu."
"204987124-0-31094";"What are ancestor moths?"
"204987124-0-31096";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-31098";"So you didn't see them leave the camp?"
"204987124-0-31099";"What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-31100";"It's the only way."
"204987124-0-31102";"You don't have to be a part of this."
"204987124-0-31104";"I appreciate that."
"204987124-0-31105";"That's why we have to win here."
"204987124-0-31106";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-31109";"Why didn't the poison affect you?"
"204987124-0-31110";"You seem nervous, is there something you aren't telling me?"
"204987124-0-31111";"What happened to Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-31112";"Can you get them back?"
"204987124-0-31116";"What do the scrolls say about this war?"
"204987124-0-31118";"What if I make the wrong choice?"
"204987124-0-31119";"You're young. You still have a long life ahead of you."
"204987124-0-31120";"Do you really want me to choose you?"
"204987124-0-31121";"How did you two hear about this village?"
"204987124-0-31122";"How can I choose?"
"204987124-0-31123";"I want to ask Kerbol about  <<1>>, one of her patients."
"204987124-0-31124";"Is there no other way?"
"204987124-0-31126";"What sort of power should I expect to receive?"
"204987124-0-31127";"Wait. I'm the Outsider?"
"204987124-0-31128";"<Examine the crates>"
"204987124-0-31130";"I'll hear what each of them has to say."
"204987124-0-31134";"Is there anything else before I go?"
"204987124-0-31135";"Is there anything else before I go?"
"204987124-0-31136";"Is there anything else before I go?"
"204987124-0-31139";"Very well. I choose you, Varen."
"204987124-0-31145";"Very well. I choose you, Lyris."
"204987124-0-31152";"If you sealed <<1>>, why not open it for her?"
"204987124-0-31154";"Do you really think my presence here will make a difference?"
"204987124-0-31158";"Very well. I choose you, Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-31159";"But I defeated him in Greenheart …."
"204987124-0-31161";"Who was <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31163";"Am I playing the part of someone from her past?"
"204987124-0-31165";"What happened to Narsis?"
"204987124-0-31172";"Can you tell me what you know then?"
"204987124-0-31176";"I'll take your words into consideration."
"204987124-0-31177";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-31179";"And what's your role in all of this?"
"204987124-0-31180";"How can I trust you?"
"204987124-0-31184";"Tell me about yourself, Cadwell."
"204987124-0-31185";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-31186";"You mentioned a bridge?"
"204987124-0-31187";"You mentioned a bridge?"
"204987124-0-31188";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-31189";"Those were bandits. This woman did nothing to you."
"204987124-0-31190";"Are you insane?"
"204987124-0-31194";"I need to get you out of here."
"204987124-0-31196";"Maybe you should convince him to continue it."
"204987124-0-31197";"How does your cure actually work?"
"204987124-0-31199";"How do you know this?"
"204987124-0-31200";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-31202";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-31203";"Why would they lock you up for that?"
"204987124-0-31204";"Where are the Daedra coming from, again?"
"204987124-0-31205";"Tell me about Laeneval."
"204987124-0-31206";"What have you done since the attacks began?"
"204987124-0-31208";"Are you trying to tell me something?"
"204987124-0-31209";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-31211";"The well was poisoned before the bandits attacked."
"204987124-0-31215";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-31217";"I have plenty of those."
"204987124-0-31221";"<<1>> said he was collecting herbs for his poultices."
"204987124-0-31222";"<<1>> checked weapons in the longhouse, while <<2>> worked the forge alone."
"204987124-0-31223";"I'll find out why <<1>> lied."
"204987124-0-31224";"<<1>>? Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31226";"What do the trials entail?"
"204987124-0-31228";"Is that all?"
"204987124-0-31229";"I will visit the shrines and hear what the masters have to say."
"204987124-0-31233";"How did the bandits learn about the dig sites?"
"204987124-0-31237";"Why are you doing this?"
"204987124-0-31238";"What is his purpose?"
"204987124-0-31239";"I'll get the relics at Thormar and Willowgrove, then."
"204987124-0-31243";"I'll get to her, Nethrin."
"204987124-0-31244";"Do you need any help?"
"204987124-0-31246";"If you're sure, then. I'll make for Claw's Strike."
"204987124-0-31247";"How is it going?"
"204987124-0-31248";"I'm looking for a way into <<1>>."
"204987124-0-31249";"Do you have spare warriors I can take?"
"204987124-0-31252";"Coldharbour, Molag Bal's realm. He plans to invade Tamriel."
"204987124-0-31253";"Why are you helping me?"
"204987124-0-31254";"Do you think the duke is doing a good job?"
"204987124-0-31257";"What's happening in the city?"
"204987124-0-31258";"He refused an offer to help defend the city?"
"204987124-0-31260";"I'll leave you to your drink then."
"204987124-0-31262";"How would I do that?"
"204987124-0-31264";"Why were you attacked by the undead?"
"204987124-0-31265";"So what can you tell me about Sea Vipers?"
"204987124-0-31266";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-31268";"Do you remember <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31273";"What is it that hides in the shadows?"
"204987124-0-31275";"What secrets?"
"204987124-0-31276";"I guess I have to wait then."
"204987124-0-31277";"Change? In what way?"
"204987124-0-31278";"Come on. We need to find any other survivors and get to the barn."
"204987124-0-31280";"Tell me more of Brackenleaf's Briars."
"204987124-0-31283";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-31287";"Your handmaiden asked that I report here."
"204987124-0-31288";"What does <<1>> have to do with this?"
"204987124-0-31290";"You don't want to know what I found then?"
"204987124-0-31295";"Yes, and I learned some things the queen wanted me to report."
"204987124-0-31297";"Captain Hjurrun turned down an offer from the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-31298";"Will it work upon any Daedra?"
"204987124-0-31299";"Will it work on you?"
"204987124-0-31305";"Glad I could help."
"204987124-0-31306";"I will go get a key from a crew member."
"204987124-0-31315";"Do you remember <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31316";"What do you propose we do?"
"204987124-0-31318";"I can handle that. What about you?"
"204987124-0-31322";"These Imperial Orders prove it."
"204987124-0-31324";"How did that happen?"
"204987124-0-31325";"How so?"
"204987124-0-31326";"What was so great about it?"
"204987124-0-31327";"I will."
"204987124-0-31328";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-31330";"Why should I trust you? I don't even know who you are."
"204987124-0-31331";"How did that happen?"
"204987124-0-31334";"You're with the Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-31335";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-31340";"You gave Thibierry a pretty good scare."
"204987124-0-31341";"You're not alone. I'm here."
"204987124-0-31342";"How will I recognize the constable?"
"204987124-0-31346";"Does the Dark Elf enchanter know how you feel?"
"204987124-0-31348";"Maybe she likes you."
"204987124-0-31350";"A vampire commander?"
"204987124-0-31351";"Where were you before everyone became ill?"
"204987124-0-31353";"Will you join me?"
"204987124-0-31359";"And you?"
"204987124-0-31361";"Can you prove your antidote will be safe?"
"204987124-0-31365";"Let Kerbol finish the ritual."
"204987124-0-31368";"I'll find a way to help you, Draven."
"204987124-0-31369";"I can't just let a werewolf go free."
"204987124-0-31370";"Do you have spare warriors I can take?"
"204987124-0-31371";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-31373";"You should come back to the camp. It's safer there."
"204987124-0-31374";"I'll talk to the guards."
"204987124-0-31377";"Why?"
"204987124-0-31380";"Why help me?"
"204987124-0-31383";"Have you seen Captain Janeve since the attack?"
"204987124-0-31384";"Not entirely unreasonable, considering the Daedra."
"204987124-0-31386";"I'm trying to find Captain Janeve."
"204987124-0-31388";"Have you seen Captain Janeve?"
"204987124-0-31395";"Let's consider what we know that she's responsible for."
"204987124-0-31397";"It's what she deserves."
"204987124-0-31398";"It's what she deserves. [Medya dies.]"
"204987124-0-31399";"She should stand trial for what she's done."
"204987124-0-31400";"Let's consider what we know that she's responsible for."
"204987124-0-31402";"I'm not sure that's right. Let's discuss this."
"204987124-0-31404";"I agree with the Countess. We can't take the chance. You have to die."
"204987124-0-31406";"May the Light bless you."
"204987124-0-31407";"I will go and confront the Duke."
"204987124-0-31409";"Do you know what the Imperials were planning?"
"204987124-0-31413";"You're right. We'll lock you up. [Let the Duke Live]"
"204987124-0-31414";"I'll be here to support you, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-31415";"As you say, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-31421";"What happened after I helped Lady Laurent recover the crown?"
"204987124-0-31422";"What happened after you escaped the Spurned Peak?"
"204987124-0-31423";"What happened after you escaped from the Spurned Peak?"
"204987124-0-31424";"Secret tunnel? You need to tell me where the secret tunnel is!"
"204987124-0-31426";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-31430";"What if I found your scouts?"
"204987124-0-31431";"Which Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-31432";"You want me to be the bait?"
"204987124-0-31433";"Let's check the tower."
"204987124-0-31434";"Make sure they get back in one piece."
"204987124-0-31438";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-31440";"Why not kill him now?"
"204987124-0-31441";"Then I'll get Renoit."
"204987124-0-31442";"How does your cure actually work?"
"204987124-0-31444";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-31449";"Is Lleraya more powerful than you?"
"204987124-0-31450";"Yes."
"204987124-0-31457";"Go on."
"204987124-0-31458";"Are there any other options?"
"204987124-0-31459";"Don't worry. I'll take you to him. [Lie]"
"204987124-0-31461";"And the spell remains intact?"
"204987124-0-31464";"I will help. What do I do?"
"204987124-0-31467";"What can you tell me about the relics?"
"204987124-0-31471";"You tricked us."
"204987124-0-31472";"Indring?"
"204987124-0-31473";"What can we do?"
"204987124-0-31478";"You mentioned someone named Meldil? Who is that?"
"204987124-0-31479";"You need to end this storm."
"204987124-0-31483";"What kind of favor?"
"204987124-0-31486";"Are the Thalmor normally in charge of soldiers?"
"204987124-0-31487";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-31488";"Why would he know where the other artifacts are, but you don't?"
"204987124-0-31489";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-31490";"What can you tell me about the artifacts?"
"204987124-0-31491";"You're talking about me."
"204987124-0-31494";"I will."
"204987124-0-31495";"Why is Montclair on the rampage?"
"204987124-0-31501";"Do you know who she was?"
"204987124-0-31503";"Thanks. I'll take the urn and go find her."
"204987124-0-31504";"That doesn't explain why I should trap <<1>>."
"204987124-0-31506";"Are you saying you had to do all of this?"
"204987124-0-31510";"I already escaped <<1>>. I can do it again."
"204987124-0-31511";"What happened to your father?"
"204987124-0-31513";"Where can we find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31514";"Where can we find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31515";"How can we close the portal?"
"204987124-0-31516";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-31519";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-31524";"I'm sorry for your loss, but we need to get to safety."
"204987124-0-31531";"Won't you care if I imprison you in <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-31533";"<Imprison <<1>> in <<Az:2>>.>"
"204987124-0-31536";"She blames herself for your death."
"204987124-0-31537";"I'll speak with her."
"204987124-0-31539";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-31542";"I understand."
"204987124-0-31543";"You mentioned you found what you needed to escape. What was it?"
"204987124-0-31545";"I will leave at once."
"204987124-0-31546";"What do you think is happening in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31547";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31548";"Why are you spread so thin?"
"204987124-0-31550";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-31551";"You're the one called the Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-31552";"I'm sorry, but I don't know."
"204987124-0-31554";"How long has <<1>> been like this?"
"204987124-0-31555";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-31556";"Elara seems to be cured. What more is left to do?"
"204987124-0-31557";"What's important about this spriggan?"
"204987124-0-31558";"He'll want to see you again."
"204987124-0-31560";"How will being the Sentinel help her?"
"204987124-0-31562";"He said you must become the new Sentinel in order to live."
"204987124-0-31564";"Even the wyrd don't know what will happen?"
"204987124-0-31566";"So your injuries—they're cured?"
"204987124-0-31568";"You don't seem concerned about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-31570";"You want to come with me?"
"204987124-0-31571";"Conservator <<1>>, from <<c:2>>?"
"204987124-0-31572";"How do we get to the shrines?"
"204987124-0-31576";"How will I recognize the constable?"
"204987124-0-31580";"Why are you called <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31581";"What can you tell me about the mayor?"
"204987124-0-31582";"All right, I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-31584";"<Find another way to wake <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-31587";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-31588";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-31596";"Why did <<1>> kidnap your wife?"
"204987124-0-31615";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-31618";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-31620";"Where are we?"
"204987124-0-31621";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-31622";"What can we do about the mayor?"
"204987124-0-31624";"And this is where I'm supposed to gather my army?"
"204987124-0-31625";"The Sentinel said you'd know what this bud means."
"204987124-0-31626";"What kind of music does he play?"
"204987124-0-31627";"Take a moment. Catch your breath."
"204987124-0-31631";"Do you know where he is now?"
"204987124-0-31632";"What kind of music does he play?"
"204987124-0-31638";"Good luck with your music."
"204987124-0-31648";"I heard you were having trouble."
"204987124-0-31650";"I can look into this, if you like."
"204987124-0-31652";"Where is the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-31657";"Be reasonable. We can discuss this."
"204987124-0-31659";"It sounds like the person you're angriest with is yourself. [<<1>> lives]"
"204987124-0-31660";"You're angry because you blame others for your own failings. You hate the person you've become."
"204987124-0-31665";"So the houses are working together?"
"204987124-0-31667";"Tell me more about the constable."
"204987124-0-31670";"I'll look for Skordo in Northpoint."
"204987124-0-31671";"What is the trial of bloodlines?"
"204987124-0-31672";"I'll see if I can figure out what the cure actually is."
"204987124-0-31673";"What kind of illness does Draven have?"
"204987124-0-31675";"What are your plans after returning to Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-31676";"What is so important about the Cartulary?"
"204987124-0-31679";"I could meet with the duke."
"204987124-0-31681";"I think he and his mother left the camp."
"204987124-0-31683";"What is the queen concerned about?"
"204987124-0-31685";"What do you want me to investigate?"
"204987124-0-31686";"How do I get to Bangkorai?"
"204987124-0-31687";"How do I get to Bangkorai?"
"204987124-0-31688";"Did King Eamond have any heirs?"
"204987124-0-31689";"Tell me about Sancre Tor."
"204987124-0-31690";"What's our plan?"
"204987124-0-31696";"I'll find him."
"204987124-0-31699";"Tell me about the Mad Architect."
"204987124-0-31700";"Sure. I'll take my chances."
"204987124-0-31706";"As you wish, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-31707";"The guards put a refugee in the stocks for talking about the Imperials."
"204987124-0-31709";"You mentioned others?"
"204987124-0-31711";"We can defend it just fine. [Signal the Crows to Attack]"
"204987124-0-31712";"We're not bargaining for freedom. [Signal the Crows to Attack]"
"204987124-0-31714";"Not for you. [Signal the Crows to Attack]"
"204987124-0-31717";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-31718";"Whose army was it?"
"204987124-0-31719";"All under your command?"
"204987124-0-31720";"Have you thought about joining the Covenant navy?"
"204987124-0-31721";"I'm glad I was there to help."
"204987124-0-31723";"Have you thought about joining the Covenant navy?"
"204987124-0-31724";"What brings you to Fahara'jad's palace?"
"204987124-0-31725";"How so?"
"204987124-0-31726";"What brings you to Fahara'jad's palace?"
"204987124-0-31727";"Do you think she'll ever forgive you for wanting to keep it?"
"204987124-0-31728";"I'm glad you are doing so well."
"204987124-0-31732";"I'm sorry they died."
"204987124-0-31734";"I'm glad to hear it."
"204987124-0-31735";"How are things with Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-31736";"I've done what I can."
"204987124-0-31737";"So you have no plan to return his advances?"
"204987124-0-31738";"You seem very happy."
"204987124-0-31739";"You're joking. Right?"
"204987124-0-31740";"You seem like you're in a good mood."
"204987124-0-31741";"Are you working with Irien?"
"204987124-0-31742";"What brings you to Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-31743";"Did you find this relic?"
"204987124-0-31744";"Where's Andrilon?"
"204987124-0-31745";"So you and Jakarn aren't working together any longer?"
"204987124-0-31746";"You were robbed?"
"204987124-0-31747";"At least they didn't kill you."
"204987124-0-31751";"How?"
"204987124-0-31753";"Why are you drinking out here?"
"204987124-0-31754";"How are Kaleen and Nicolene?"
"204987124-0-31756";"How is Kasan?"
"204987124-0-31757";"Good? Didn't you say he hunted you?"
"204987124-0-31758";"How so?"
"204987124-0-31760";"And he survived?"
"204987124-0-31762";"So you're finally going to settle down?"
"204987124-0-31764";"I don't think so."
"204987124-0-31765";"Where's Weynon Priory?"
"204987124-0-31767";"I didn't know you were interested in poetry."
"204987124-0-31768";"Will you read me some poetry, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-31769";"Captain Lerisa?"
"204987124-0-31770";"Will you read me some poetry, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-31771";"Has Lerisa returned your interest?"
"204987124-0-31772";"<Keep listening>"
"204987124-0-31774";"Have you found anything interesting?"
"204987124-0-31775";"Is that Clanker standing outside?"
"204987124-0-31776";"What do you hope to find in these Dwemer ruins?"
"204987124-0-31777";"What are you doing in the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-31779";"Sounds like you're lucky to be alive."
"204987124-0-31782";"Are you happy to see Telonil again?"
"204987124-0-31783";"What brings you to the market?"
"204987124-0-31784";"It's good you found each other again."
"204987124-0-31787";"Where are they?"
"204987124-0-31789";"I will free him."
"204987124-0-31791";"Why are you trying to get out of town?"
"204987124-0-31792";"What's got you worried?"
"204987124-0-31795";"Go on."
"204987124-0-31796";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-31797";"What did they want?"
"204987124-0-31798";"How did the forces of the Garrison hold them off?"
"204987124-0-31799";"A selfless act."
"204987124-0-31800";"And?"
"204987124-0-31801";"What is the queen doing here?"
"204987124-0-31802";"Quite a story."
"204987124-0-31803";"But she inherited the throne. She's the ruler of Evermore."
"204987124-0-31804";"Who is St. Pelin?"
"204987124-0-31805";"How?"
"204987124-0-31806";"Why are you here instead of with the rest of your order?"
"204987124-0-31807";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-31809";"Why not portal me into the Mages Guild in Evermore?"
"204987124-0-31810";"You heard the Reachmen are at the city gates?"
"204987124-0-31812";"Well it looks like you picked the right time to stay home."
"204987124-0-31813";"Very well."
"204987124-0-31814";"I am."
"204987124-0-31815";"Azura spoke to me through her statue. She asked me to finish what you had not."
"204987124-0-31816";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-31817";"You said you could send me back. What about you?"
"204987124-0-31819";"I am."
"204987124-0-31822";"Have you heard of someone named Lleraya?"
"204987124-0-31823";"He told me to tell you everyone in the village is a werewolf, even Kerbol."
"204987124-0-31824";"Yes. I'll help you."
"204987124-0-31825";"I think you might want to take a walk around town."
"204987124-0-31826";"Of course."
"204987124-0-31827";"Of course."
"204987124-0-31828";"I'm just looking for honest answers."
"204987124-0-31830";"No. Perhaps I can find another way to help."
"204987124-0-31832";"How did the Khajiit capture you?"
"204987124-0-31833";"Sir Jarnot and Glarikha were killed."
"204987124-0-31838";"So what happened to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31839";"Can't you use your magic to open the door?"
"204987124-0-31841";"Yes. Gaston asked me the same. Leave this to me."
"204987124-0-31844";"<<1>> is here, as well."
"204987124-0-31846";"Is there anything else I can do?"
"204987124-0-31847";"Is she safe?"
"204987124-0-31849";"Is there anything more I can do?"
"204987124-0-31854";"Where is Sancre Tor located?"
"204987124-0-31855";"How do we break the ward?"
"204987124-0-31856";"Tell me more about Sancre Tor."
"204987124-0-31857";"How do we break the ward?"
"204987124-0-31858";"What sort of areas?"
"204987124-0-31859";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-31861";"Will you be able to make it through this, Sai?"
"204987124-0-31862";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-31863";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-31866";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-31869";"Did you and Sai ever talk about what happened in the Halls of Torment?"
"204987124-0-31870";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-31872";"And my soul?"
"204987124-0-31873";"That's very precise."
"204987124-0-31874";"<<1>> needs <<2>> for her ratification ceremony."
"204987124-0-31875";"I have other questions."
"204987124-0-31876";"I haven't heard much about your company."
"204987124-0-31877";"Why would <<1>> be looking for <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-31878";"So business is good?"
"204987124-0-31879";"What do you do exactly?"
"204987124-0-31880";"Seven Shadows?"
"204987124-0-31881";"How would they do that?"
"204987124-0-31883";"Where should we start looking?"
"204987124-0-31885";"If it's called <<1>>, what do you know of Rajhin?"
"204987124-0-31886";"But you have no goods to ship."
"204987124-0-31887";"So what is this place exactly?"
"204987124-0-31888";"And just how long do you think this will go on?"
"204987124-0-31890";"Why are you afraid of frost trolls?"
"204987124-0-31892";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-31893";"What will you do, now?"
"204987124-0-31894";"Your companions?"
"204987124-0-31895";"You speak as though you've been there before."
"204987124-0-31897";"What boy was worth traveling to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31898";"I found your journal."
"204987124-0-31899";"I met the spirit of your son."
"204987124-0-31900";"I freed <<1>>'s spirit from <<2>>."
"204987124-0-31901";"He was afraid <<1>> would wake up."
"204987124-0-31902";"How long were you trapped in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31903";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-31904";"You have been to <<1>>, then?"
"204987124-0-31906";"Will you be staying at your tower?"
"204987124-0-31907";"Do you remember <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31908";"What do you know about the Dragon Break?"
"204987124-0-31909";"Any idea what the witches' ritual is for?"
"204987124-0-31910";"Any idea what the witches' ritual is for?"
"204987124-0-31913";"Any idea what the witches' ritual is for?"
"204987124-0-31915";"Why should I try to kill him?"
"204987124-0-31916";"Whatever you say."
"204987124-0-31917";"I'll do this if you swear to leave <<1>> forever."
"204987124-0-31921";"Why should I believe you?"
"204987124-0-31928";"So where is this place?"
"204987124-0-31929";"How do I fill <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-31933";"Blood? What change are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-31943";"Why have you surrendered yourself?"
"204987124-0-31951";"[Spare Him] You pose no threat to us. You'll be held captive until the city is secure."
"204987124-0-31955";"I'm here to support you, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-31957";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-31958";"What's so special about this Emerald Chalice?"
"204987124-0-31959";"What's going on here?"
"204987124-0-31960";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-31961";"What's going on here?"
"204987124-0-31962";"Did the crows swarming Evermore come from here?"
"204987124-0-31963";"What does she want here?"
"204987124-0-31964";"You just assume I'm like all the others?"
"204987124-0-31965";"Where do we find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-31966";"What do you know about Uela?"
"204987124-0-31967";"So what's the plan?"
"204987124-0-31968";"Are you the leader of the wyrd here?"
"204987124-0-31970";"What can you tell me about the Falinesti Faithful?"
"204987124-0-31972";"Are you the leader of the wyrd here?"
"204987124-0-31973";"I welcome your help."
"204987124-0-31975";"I'm ready. Let's go."
"204987124-0-31977";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-31979";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-31980";"Do you know where <<1>> went?"
"204987124-0-31982";"Did <<1>> enslave the Falinesti Faithful?"
"204987124-0-31984";"Did she agree to that?"
"204987124-0-31985";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-31986";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-31990";"What is she looking for?"
"204987124-0-31991";"She said it's a secret only a crow would know."
"204987124-0-31992";"Why would it fall apart?"
"204987124-0-31994";"<<1>> wants to control <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-31996";"Wyrd?"
"204987124-0-31997";"You're kidding me."
"204987124-0-31998";"How's everyone taking King Eamond's death?"
"204987124-0-31999";"…And?"
"204987124-0-32000";"They haven't noticed?"
"204987124-0-32001";"And how's that going?"
"204987124-0-32002";"Did any crows get in here?"
"204987124-0-32003";"How's it taste?"
"204987124-0-32004";"And you?"
"204987124-0-32005";"How's business?"
"204987124-0-32006";"That's harsh."
"204987124-0-32007";"What were you, before you died?"
"204987124-0-32008";"You mentioned <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-32009";"Is there any way we could commune with them?"
"204987124-0-32011";"Yes. Let's do it."
"204987124-0-32013";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32015";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-32016";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-32017";"The people don't like the duke?"
"204987124-0-32018";"What happened to the old guard captain?"
"204987124-0-32019";"Who's ruling the kingdom?"
"204987124-0-32020";"I'll fight your friend."
"204987124-0-32021";"I'll look for another crow then."
"204987124-0-32022";"All right. I'll look for another crow then."
"204987124-0-32023";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32025";"I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-32027";"Whatever you say."
"204987124-0-32028";"Where is the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-32032";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32033";"He took the Amulet with him?"
"204987124-0-32034";"Did we succeed? Is Tamriel safe?"
"204987124-0-32035";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-32036";"The other alliances?"
"204987124-0-32038";"Can you send me there?"
"204987124-0-32041";"You don't think Captain Hjurrun knows what he's doing?"
"204987124-0-32042";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32043";"How long have you been waiting for him?"
"204987124-0-32044";"How did you two hear about this village?"
"204987124-0-32045";"Who's ruling the kingdom?"
"204987124-0-32046";"Are you sure it's not a trap?"
"204987124-0-32048";"That sounds like a wise decision."
"204987124-0-32049";"Why do you need her heart?"
"204987124-0-32051";"I'm ready whenever you are."
"204987124-0-32052";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-32053";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32055";"All right. I'll bring back his head."
"204987124-0-32057";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32059";"All right. I can handle that."
"204987124-0-32061";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32064";"I understand."
"204987124-0-32065";"As advocate, I was told to leave no stone unturned in my investigation."
"204987124-0-32066";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32067";"Thank you for the information."
"204987124-0-32068";"I'm looking for <<1>>."
"204987124-0-32070";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-32071";"What happened to her soldiers?"
"204987124-0-32073";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-32074";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-32075";"How long have you been imprisoned?"
"204987124-0-32077";"Why are you angry with <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-32082";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-32085";"Why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-32086";"Why is it a cruel jest?"
"204987124-0-32088";"Why are you angry at General Endare?"
"204987124-0-32094";"Thank you. I'll speak with the duke at the keep."
"204987124-0-32095";"The Reachmen attacked, and you came to the village's aid?"
"204987124-0-32098";"How did the witchmen succeed?"
"204987124-0-32099";"You've been a squire for more than thirty years?"
"204987124-0-32102";"Not many speak of their part in a war."
"204987124-0-32104";"I'll take care of things."
"204987124-0-32107";"I doubt that."
"204987124-0-32108";"No, you've gone too far. [<<1>> dies]"
"204987124-0-32112";"Have you found anyone to help yet?"
"204987124-0-32113";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-32115";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-32116";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-32117";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-32118";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32123";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-32125";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-32126";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-32127";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-32128";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32134";"Can you tell me anything else about this plague?"
"204987124-0-32135";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-32136";"There's a cure?"
"204987124-0-32137";"All right. I can handle that."
"204987124-0-32139";"Then why does the queen want to consult him now?"
"204987124-0-32140";"Is there reason to believe he isn't?"
"204987124-0-32141";"Where can I find Sir Jarnot?"
"204987124-0-32144";"Such as?"
"204987124-0-32145";"Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-32146";"With the king dead, who's in charge here?"
"204987124-0-32147";"What's with all the crows?"
"204987124-0-32148";"How's he doing?"
"204987124-0-32149";"Does anyone know what's bringing them?"
"204987124-0-32150";"What's happened?"
"204987124-0-32153";"What are you expecting me to find?"
"204987124-0-32154";"Where can I find Sir Jarnot?"
"204987124-0-32155";"What do you mean, his successor?"
"204987124-0-32157";"I need to talk with Princess Elara too."
"204987124-0-32158";"Does that have something to do with this bud?"
"204987124-0-32160";"What if <<1>> has <<2>>? Are you asking me to fight a Dominion general?"
"204987124-0-32162";"Can your construct help me within the inner vault?"
"204987124-0-32166";"How can you help me within the inner vault?"
"204987124-0-32167";"What do you know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-32168";"I'll have to report this to the queen."
"204987124-0-32186";"Yes."
"204987124-0-32187";"I don't know. He was also stabbed through his breastplate."
"204987124-0-32188";"Maybe. It showed Medya had a son named Labhraidh after Black Drake's push through here."
"204987124-0-32189";"The rest of the records are on the shelf. This was on the floor, as though someone had just read it."
"204987124-0-32190";"The murderer didn't hide anything here."
"204987124-0-32191";"There were two other people with him, based on the dishes. He trusted the people he was with."
"204987124-0-32192";"I also found signs that whoever killed him must have washed up here before leaving."
"204987124-0-32193";"I found the village records from the time of the Black Drake's attacks."
"204987124-0-32194";"There are signs Sir Etienne had received treatment."
"204987124-0-32195";"I found the village records from the time of the Black Drake's attacks."
"204987124-0-32196";"We need to find Medya. Either she's dead too, or she knows who did this."
"204987124-0-32197";"We'll find out when I track her down."
"204987124-0-32199";"You can do that?"
"204987124-0-32200";"Go ahead."
"204987124-0-32201";"Of course not."
"204987124-0-32202";"Why would you help Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-32203";"Why would you help Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-32204";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-32206";"She did help me defeat the abomination. Her spirit is at rest now."
"204987124-0-32207";"I haven't found her dead. I'm looking for her."
"204987124-0-32209";"I need to find Medya, do you know where she might be?"
"204987124-0-32210";"I need to find Medya, do you know where she might be?"
"204987124-0-32211";"I should talk to <<1>> as well."
"204987124-0-32213";"I'd better head up there now."
"204987124-0-32214";"The Reachmen attacked Murcien's Hamlet during the Black Drake's war, didn't they?"
"204987124-0-32215";"Does Medya have family here, a son?"
"204987124-0-32216";"The witchmen haven't attacked here since then?"
"204987124-0-32217";"She's out there alone, treating people? Isn't she afraid of the witchmen?"
"204987124-0-32218";"I need to find Medya, do you know where she might be?"
"204987124-0-32220";"I'll keep looking, then."
"204987124-0-32224";"How can you help me within the inner vault?"
"204987124-0-32227";"The crates were stamped the ""Bjoulsae Queen."""
"204987124-0-32228";"Captain Hjurrun turned down an offer from the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-32229";"Captain Hjurrun turned down an offer from the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-32230";"Are you worried that people will question your plan?"
"204987124-0-32231";"What's your alternative?"
"204987124-0-32233";"I'd like to know why the wyrd don't want to help you first."
"204987124-0-32234";"Elara seems to be cured. What more is left to do?"
"204987124-0-32235";"You think you can trust the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-32237";"There's proof on that ship though, isn't there?"
"204987124-0-32238";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-32239";"All right. Here you go. I'll meet you outside."
"204987124-0-32241";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-32242";"Where can I find you if I need you?"
"204987124-0-32244";"What about your role as the Prophet?"
"204987124-0-32245";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-32246";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-32247";"Will we see each other again?"
"204987124-0-32249";"Farewell, Lyris Titanborn."
"204987124-0-32251";"Will we meet again?"
"204987124-0-32252";"I must return with the ring, but perhaps Sai Sahan and the others can help."
"204987124-0-32254";"I'm sorry. Things will be all right, in time."
"204987124-0-32256";"I'll be there as soon as possible."
"204987124-0-32257";"I subdued him on the hillside …."
"204987124-0-32258";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-32259";"You're one of the people she hired to help her?"
"204987124-0-32260";"Yes."
"204987124-0-32262";"What's the catch?"
"204987124-0-32264";"What's the reward?"
"204987124-0-32265";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-32266";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-32268";"What's the reward?"
"204987124-0-32269";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-32270";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-32271";"Tell me more about this Folium."
"204987124-0-32281";"The people who died were your neighbors."
"204987124-0-32282";"You could have left the hamlet and lived with the witchmen if you didn't want to be near outsiders."
"204987124-0-32285";"Is that why you and the witchmen were willing to destroy the hamlet?"
"204987124-0-32286";"Why did you kill Sir Etienne? You had already treated his injuries, you could have let him go."
"204987124-0-32287";"Why did you kill Sir Etienne? You had already treated his injuries, you could have let him go."
"204987124-0-32288";"You've been a squire for more than thirty years?"
"204987124-0-32290";"I see. What can I do to help now?"
"204987124-0-32291";"What can you tell me about Murcien's Hamlet?"
"204987124-0-32293";"Seems like you'll have a lot of recording to do after this attack."
"204987124-0-32294";"You're the local healer?"
"204987124-0-32295";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-32296";"I might be able to help, but I'll need to know more."
"204987124-0-32297";"No. You can take the heart."
"204987124-0-32299";"All right. I'll throw the heart in the circle when you say."
"204987124-0-32302";"So <<1>> is scared of rats?"
"204987124-0-32304";"What's the key open?"
"204987124-0-32306";"What exactly is the Viridian Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-32307";"Will the princess survive?"
"204987124-0-32309";"Kerbol said we must lure Draven away from the village."
"204987124-0-32310";"That might anger it."
"204987124-0-32311";"We need it to save Princess Elara."
"204987124-0-32313";"Would you doom this girl to die for a grudge against the Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-32314";"Then let me have what I seek."
"204987124-0-32315";"Would you doom this girl to die for a grudge against the Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-32316";"Is there nothing I can do to convince you?"
"204987124-0-32320";"Gasteau said he knew a way out."
"204987124-0-32322";"He had an affair, but it went bad. The woman killed him."
"204987124-0-32326";"What sort of tastes?"
"204987124-0-32327";"So you haven't seen nor heard of Sorion?"
"204987124-0-32329";"What is the Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-32330";"So you haven't seen nor heard of Sorion?"
"204987124-0-32331";"We'll figure it out."
"204987124-0-32333";"We should just ease her passing."
"204987124-0-32336";"You really think this will save the spriggan?"
"204987124-0-32337";"All right."
"204987124-0-32345";"How do we draw him out?"
"204987124-0-32347";"You want me to do this on my own?"
"204987124-0-32350";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-32351";"You just said you come to conquer. How can I trust you?"
"204987124-0-32352";"What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-32353";"I don't have much choice. Let's do it."
"204987124-0-32354";"All right, I'll break the curse."
"204987124-0-32361";"What happens if we fail?"
"204987124-0-32362";"Is the site in good health?"
"204987124-0-32366";"Why did your husband do this to Anconath?"
"204987124-0-32367";"So you're not going to do as Verandis asks?"
"204987124-0-32368";"Verandis is worried about Montclair's forces regrouping behind us."
"204987124-0-32369";"Was there anything that helped him?"
"204987124-0-32370";"I can wait."
"204987124-0-32371";"Why not ask <<1>>? He told me about <<2>>."
"204987124-0-32373";"All right."
"204987124-0-32374";"Why name your ship after an unlucky bird?"
"204987124-0-32375";"I'll deal with the Mad Architect."
"204987124-0-32379";"Something about Daedra?"
"204987124-0-32381";"I found the amulet."
"204987124-0-32389";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-32390";"All right. Follow me."
"204987124-0-32391";"Are you certain? I'm headed to stop <<1>>."
"204987124-0-32394";"I have a poultice for you. Do you know where Isabeth is?"
"204987124-0-32396";"I'll do my best. Take this and get back to camp."
"204987124-0-32397";"Why was that a mistake?"
"204987124-0-32398";"Is there some way I can help?"
"204987124-0-32399";"What about poultices? The knights need poultices to heal their wounded."
"204987124-0-32400";"I understand your frustration, but lives are at stake."
"204987124-0-32401";"I'll find any shards that remain and defeat the crypt caretakers."
"204987124-0-32402";"I appreciate that. So you'll give me the poultices?"
"204987124-0-32403";"All right. You have the payment. I'll take the poultices."
"204987124-0-32404";"I'll go ask if she'll agree to your proposition."
"204987124-0-32405";"What do you want in trade?"
"204987124-0-32406";"What Argonian?"
"204987124-0-32407";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32408";"How bad off are you?"
"204987124-0-32409";"All right. Where are they?"
"204987124-0-32411";"So I'd be hunting Daedra and stopping these Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32412";"I'd like to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-32413";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-32415";"I'll be back soon with the Baandari poultices."
"204987124-0-32418";"Go on."
"204987124-0-32419";"Do you know where they went?"
"204987124-0-32420";"I'll look for the Baandari herbalists by the lake."
"204987124-0-32421";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-32422";"That makes sense. I'll do it."
"204987124-0-32423";"Just tell me where you want me."
"204987124-0-32424";"All right. I'll go to the northeast gate."
"204987124-0-32425";"Do you know where Isabeth went?"
"204987124-0-32434";"Isabeth? Do you know where they went?"
"204987124-0-32436";"Thank you. I'll untie you. Get to the camp."
"204987124-0-32437";"Did you see a villager with her? Laetille?"
"204987124-0-32439";"I'll go speak with her."
"204987124-0-32440";"Inside her?"
"204987124-0-32442";"I am?"
"204987124-0-32443";"You should get out of here."
"204987124-0-32444";"I'm looking for some Dominion scouts. Have you seen them?"
"204987124-0-32445";"What happens?"
"204987124-0-32446";"Aren't you concerned about the killing in the streets?"
"204987124-0-32447";"Sounds like a good plan."
"204987124-0-32450";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-32452";"I didn't find it on an Argonian."
"204987124-0-32453";"Here, take it."
"204987124-0-32454";"I found this journal near the amulet."
"204987124-0-32456";"Why would you do that?"
"204987124-0-32457";"Baron Dorell mentioned something about traitors?"
"204987124-0-32458";"Was Montclair always this ambitious?"
"204987124-0-32461";"I'm looking for some Dominion scouts."
"204987124-0-32462";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-32463";"Whose arrival?"
"204987124-0-32468";"Someone else could pick it up. You should destroy it. [<<1>> lives]"
"204987124-0-32470";"All right. I'll take the poultices to the knights then."
"204987124-0-32471";"I didn't see."
"204987124-0-32474";"I'll go through the portal as soon as you open it."
"204987124-0-32477";"Is there some way I can help?"
"204987124-0-32481";"Jode's Chariot?"
"204987124-0-32484";"Are you certain that's truly Arkay's will?"
"204987124-0-32485";"I'll tell him what you've said."
"204987124-0-32486";"Will you align with Captain Gaercroft?"
"204987124-0-32488";"They saw you as a threat?"
"204987124-0-32489";"You mentioned it was planted inside of her?"
"204987124-0-32490";"What are the markers?"
"204987124-0-32492";"Isabeth? Where is she?"
"204987124-0-32498";"What do you do with them?"
"204987124-0-32499";"Until recently?"
"204987124-0-32500";"Why aren't the penalties harsher?"
"204987124-0-32502";"I'm afraid not."
"204987124-0-32503";"Will the undead respond to your command?"
"204987124-0-32504";"You think we should extinguish them?"
"204987124-0-32505";"All right. I'll extinguish the flames and meet you at the monument."
"204987124-0-32506";"Jode's Chariot?"
"204987124-0-32509";"When I arrived, he was as you see him."
"204987124-0-32513";"All right."
"204987124-0-32514";"Jode's Chariot?"
"204987124-0-32525";"No, I made a deal with him to leave town."
"204987124-0-32526";"How did Dutheil become the Mad Architect?"
"204987124-0-32527";"What will happen to <<1>>'s citizens?"
"204987124-0-32528";"What will happen to <<1>>'s citizens?"
"204987124-0-32529";"I killed him. That was <<1>>'s deal."
"204987124-0-32532";"Is it even possible to defeat Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-32543";"I really don't know, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-32546";"How was his childhood difficult?"
"204987124-0-32548";"Your home was destroyed. Where will you go now?"
"204987124-0-32549";"I don't think the merchant would see it that way."
"204987124-0-32550";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-32551";"The Hollow Moon?"
"204987124-0-32560";"What do I do? Jump?"
"204987124-0-32562";"I understand."
"204987124-0-32564";"Try this poultice. It might help."
"204987124-0-32566";"I found your hirelings, too."
"204987124-0-32567";"One was killed and one was turned into a Goblin."
"204987124-0-32568";"Can you reverse the magic of the chalice?"
"204987124-0-32570";"Anyone who drinks from the chalice is turned into a Goblin."
"204987124-0-32571";"I've also learned the secret of the Emerald Chalice."
"204987124-0-32577";"<<1>> was working for you?"
"204987124-0-32578";"Yes. I can investigate the royal crypt."
"204987124-0-32581";"So you have the poultices?"
"204987124-0-32583";"We need to warn the Knight Commander."
"204987124-0-32584";"So he thinks the prince has been corrupted?"
"204987124-0-32585";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-32587";"What do we have to do?"
"204987124-0-32590";"I am."
"204987124-0-32592";"You're a thief."
"204987124-0-32593";"That doesn't explain everything."
"204987124-0-32596";"What do the merchants think of your charity?"
"204987124-0-32598";"It's possible. I've seen them expose it."
"204987124-0-32599";"I'll help however I can, but I'm not going to steal for you."
"204987124-0-32601";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-32602";"There is truly no other way?"
"204987124-0-32604";"Let me talk to Isabeth before you do anything."
"204987124-0-32611";"Stenwick said we should just search for it."
"204987124-0-32614";"Is the High King in Shornhelm?"
"204987124-0-32624";"I found a letter. Reezal-Jul plans to bring reinforcements in through the Fevered Mews."
"204987124-0-32625";"How can I tell who is really needy?"
"204987124-0-32628";"I'll head to the Fevered Mews and free the hostages."
"204987124-0-32630";"Uhm … not recently?"
"204987124-0-32631";"You're alive. Looks like it worked."
"204987124-0-32632";"Can't you find another squirrel?"
"204987124-0-32636";"Snap out of it, soldier! You've got better things to do than look for useless charms."
"204987124-0-32638";"What about the bloodfiends?"
"204987124-0-32639";"You mentioned something about the bloodfiends."
"204987124-0-32644";"I'll find them. Use this poultice and get back to camp."
"204987124-0-32645";"You're right. What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-32646";"How do you know this?"
"204987124-0-32647";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32648";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32650";"You really think the Imperials want peace?"
"204987124-0-32651";"Where will the parley take place?"
"204987124-0-32652";"Where will the parley take place?"
"204987124-0-32653";"Are you planning violence?"
"204987124-0-32655";"Being a bandit is no better than being the chieftain's wife, no matter how you look at it."
"204987124-0-32656";"How'd the Imperials catch you?"
"204987124-0-32657";"Not everyone chooses this life of their own accord."
"204987124-0-32658";"Not everyone chooses this life of their own accord."
"204987124-0-32660";"Let's unlock those shackles."
"204987124-0-32661";"Let's unlock those shackles."
"204987124-0-32662";"There is nothing shameful about belonging to a stronghold."
"204987124-0-32663";"You're really a bandit?"
"204987124-0-32666";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-32667";"Shortly after the Jade Dragoons left <<1>>."

"204987124-0-32672";"What can I do?"

"204987124-0-32677";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32680";"I'll go to the barracks and free any prisoners I find then."
"204987124-0-32681";"Doesn't that mean Elara will die?"
"204987124-0-32685";"Doesn't that mean Elara will die?"
"204987124-0-32686";"How would I destroy the bud?"
"204987124-0-32687";"Before I let you go, I want to be sure I won't regret it."
"204987124-0-32691";"So why do you want to kill <<1>>? He said you were friends."
"204987124-0-32694";"<Give her a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32696";"<Give her a package of <<1>>.>"

"204987124-0-32714";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-32716";"A strange figure appeared in my cell. An old man in rags."
"204987124-0-32719";"A voice in the royal crypt said this was a blessing from Arkay himself."
"204987124-0-32720";"How can a madman possibly help us?"
"204987124-0-32721";"On behalf of Prince Adrien who has also risen?"
"204987124-0-32722";"All right. I'll destroy the defilers and meet you at the church."
"204987124-0-32726";"How do we get the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-32727";"We will, as soon as you're well. You should rest, now."
"204987124-0-32729";"As you say, Sai."
"204987124-0-32730";"We're trying to get inside the Prophet's Cell. The door is sealed."
"204987124-0-32733";"How do we get through all of that?"
"204987124-0-32735";"Where's the entrance?"
"204987124-0-32736";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-32738";"Why?"
"204987124-0-32741";"I guess you don't have a high opinion of the Altmer and Queen Ayrenn."
"204987124-0-32745";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-32746";"What have you learned so far?"
"204987124-0-32747";"<Give her a package of <<1>>.>"

"204987124-0-32761";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32762";"Consider it an investment. Go earn back your honor."
"204987124-0-32763";"<<1>>?"
"204987124-0-32764";"Coward! Go back there and make him regret it!"
"204987124-0-32765";"I only did what Leila asked. She was worried about you!"
"204987124-0-32767";"Wylon, we need to be cautious. Something isn't right here."
"204987124-0-32771";"Did Nagoth defeat you?"
"204987124-0-32773";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-32780";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32784";"The Architect mentioned you destroyed his works before."
"204987124-0-32785";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32786";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-32787";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32788";"Lothson seems to think you're barely hanging on."
"204987124-0-32789";"Can you tell me something about the necklace?"
"204987124-0-32791";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32792";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-32793";"What happened to your daughter?"
"204987124-0-32794";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32796";"Why do you live in these woods?"
"204987124-0-32800";"What can you tell me about those bandits?"
"204987124-0-32803";"What was Saryne's role?"
"204987124-0-32804";"What did Reynelle do?"
"204987124-0-32805";"What was Saryne's role?"
"204987124-0-32807";"Aren't we losing more time stumbling around down here?"
"204987124-0-32808";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-32809";"Don't do this, Lyris. There must be another way."
"204987124-0-32811";"After the destruction you wrought for greed and envy, you will stay here."
"204987124-0-32813";"My decision is made."
"204987124-0-32814";"Be at peace."
"204987124-0-32818";"I understand. Good luck."
"204987124-0-32819";"I'll keep him safe."
"204987124-0-32820";"I'll keep him safe."
"204987124-0-32821";"Do you have something in mind?"
"204987124-0-32823";"Not if we remove the source of the corruption."
"204987124-0-32825";"Where exactly was he to be entombed?"
"204987124-0-32826";"What is the ""Orc's Finger""?"
"204987124-0-32827";"Where is your brother?"
"204987124-0-32833";"How do we get in?"
"204987124-0-32834";"I'll go talk to Father Quiston."
"204987124-0-32836";"I can handle that. Where is the royal crypt?"
"204987124-0-32838";"Certainly."
"204987124-0-32841";"Have any Imperials been sighted beyond the walls?"
"204987124-0-32842";"I see a few within the walls."
"204987124-0-32843";"You deceived him. He thought you were a god!"
"204987124-0-32846";"What will happen to them?"
"204987124-0-32847";"How go the repairs?"
"204987124-0-32848";"Where are Lleraya and Montclair?"
"204987124-0-32850";"What do you think we're going to find here?"
"204987124-0-32852";"Really?"
"204987124-0-32854";"And in the graveyard itself?"
"204987124-0-32855";"Is Montclair that vessel?"
"204987124-0-32857";"Why does Lyris call you the Prophet?"
"204987124-0-32858";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-32861";"How do we get in?"
"204987124-0-32863";"Daedric Anchors?"
"204987124-0-32864";"How would I get in?"
"204987124-0-32865";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-32866";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-32867";"Are you sure that's the only way?"
"204987124-0-32870";"Are you satisfied?"
"204987124-0-32872";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-32873";"Sounds serious. And you said you're recruiting?"
"204987124-0-32876";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-32877";"[Lie] Everything I said was true."
"204987124-0-32879";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-32880";"<<1>> wants me to enter the tomb."
"204987124-0-32881";"<<1>> wants me to enter the tomb."
"204987124-0-32882";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-32885";"Do you think that's wise?"
"204987124-0-32887";"Agreed."
"204987124-0-32889";"<<1>> drove her mad. I had to kill her."
"204987124-0-32890";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-32891";"All right. Here it is."
"204987124-0-32894";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-32896";"She found <<1>>, but it drove her mad."
"204987124-0-32898";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-32904";"Care to elaborate?"
"204987124-0-32906";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-32908";"Isn't that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-32910";"Can you tell me more about this concoction you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-32912";"How do I get to the circlet?"
"204987124-0-32913";"There's no way to get you out of there?"
"204987124-0-32914";"She's writing about bloodfiends. If hunters know the difference, vampires would be safer."
"204987124-0-32917";"Why is this all so critical? Is this thing that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-32918";"How do I get to the circlet?"
"204987124-0-32919";"I'll figure it out."
"204987124-0-32920";"How do I get to the circlet?"
"204987124-0-32921";"That can't be a popular decision."
"204987124-0-32922";"He said our fates are intertwined."
"204987124-0-32923";"I can still hear his voice in my head. What does he want me to help you do?"
"204987124-0-32928";"<Keep Reading>"
"204987124-0-32930";"I should recover Urenenya's soul gem and take it to Silaseli."
"204987124-0-32933";"Have you finished translating that Ayleid book?"
"204987124-0-32934";"How can we destroy it?"
"204987124-0-32937";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-32938";"Was it just the four of you and Leila seeking the relic?"
"204987124-0-32941";"Do you really think he has to die?"
"204987124-0-32946";"What?"
"204987124-0-32947";"What's the point of this story?"
"204987124-0-32949";"Why?"
"204987124-0-32953";"But?"
"204987124-0-32954";"What were you looking for before we attacked?"
"204987124-0-32956";"Useful with what?"
"204987124-0-32957";"Who attacked <<1>>?"

"204987124-0-32969";"<Smash the Soul Gem>"
"204987124-0-32971";"Can we chat a moment, Raz? I need a moment to think."
"204987124-0-32972";"The mission in Skywatch."
"204987124-0-32973";"Our time on Auridon. That was quite the battle."
"204987124-0-32974";"How can I forget Hectahame?"
"204987124-0-32978";"I'm sorry your friend betrayed you."
"204987124-0-32982";"Gone rogue? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-32984";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-32989";"What do you think he's waiting for?"
"204987124-0-32991";"I guess there's nothing more to say then."
"204987124-0-32992";"Our mission in Mathiisen."
"204987124-0-32993";"The mission in Skywatch."
"204987124-0-32994";"Our mission in Mathiisen."
"204987124-0-32995";"Woodhearth was quite the adventure, right?"
"204987124-0-32996";"How can I forget Hectahame?"
"204987124-0-32997";"Woodhearth was quite the adventure, right?"
"204987124-0-32999";"Can you tell me more about this concoction you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-33000";"Thank you for seeing this through to the end."
"204987124-0-33001";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-33013";"What should I tell Elara?"
"204987124-0-33015";"What are the Glenmoril Wyrd?"
"204987124-0-33016";"What's wrong with Laetille?"
"204987124-0-33017";"You're right. We need to remain focused."
"204987124-0-33020";"How sick is Laetille?"
"204987124-0-33026";"Any luck?"
"204987124-0-33032";"What else can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-33033";"You care for Verandis, don't you?"
"204987124-0-33036";"What are the wyrd doing to you?"
"204987124-0-33040";"How can I convince you to ally with them against the Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-33041";"Any idea how to distract him?"
"204987124-0-33045";"Has he been harrassing you?"
"204987124-0-33047";"So maybe I could use the trinket to spook the bailiff?"
"204987124-0-33049";"So <<1>> is scared of rats?"
"204987124-0-33051";"So <<1>> is scared of rats?"

"204987124-0-33068";"This is a local rebellion. Why should I get involved?"
"204987124-0-33069";"Has <<1>> told you anything about his sons?"
"204987124-0-33070";"What were you saying about the poultice?"

"204987124-0-33124";"What do you plan to do with <<1>> and his sons?"
"204987124-0-33125";"I think Queen Eselde will be an excellent ruler."
"204987124-0-33127";"Yes. Countess Tamrith."
"204987124-0-33128";"I think King Alard will be an excellent ruler."

"204987124-0-33172";"You said the Oghma Infinium would be mine."
"204987124-0-33173";"What can you tell me about the Tear of Anurraame?"
"204987124-0-33174";"We never learned why the Ayleids hid this relic within this desolate tower."
"204987124-0-33176";"You mentioned that before. What mistake did we make?"
"204987124-0-33177";"Why don't you help me retrieve the Tear?"

"204987124-0-33201";"The Tomb of Anahbi."
"204987124-0-33202";"Is it true?"
"204987124-0-33203";"What do you have for me?"
"204987124-0-33206";"Yes. I can speak to her for you."
"204987124-0-33209";"What might that be?"
"204987124-0-33210";"What are the phrases?"
"204987124-0-33216";"What if I use the wrong phrase?"
"204987124-0-33217";"You mentioned she sent you to find me. How could that be?"
"204987124-0-33218";"What can you tell me about Gil-Var-Delle?"
"204987124-0-33219";"Who?"
"204987124-0-33221";"Who are the people we're trying to find?"
"204987124-0-33222";"Tell me more about Almalexia."
"204987124-0-33224";"Something like that."
"204987124-0-33226";"You don't have to be afraid any more."
"204987124-0-33228";"So how do we destroy the Anchor?"
"204987124-0-33230";"How can we destroy them then?"
"204987124-0-33233";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-33237";"What's your next step?"
"204987124-0-33239";"Goblins? Is that what you're researching?"
"204987124-0-33241";"That her army is coming to kill us all."
"204987124-0-33247";"And the knights aren't giving you any compensation?"
"204987124-0-33251";"I'll go to Northglen and see how I can help."
"204987124-0-33255";"The Imperials have raided more than once?"
"204987124-0-33264";"The queen's going to promote you to Lieutenant."
"204987124-0-33265";"You know Captain Hjurrun is dead, right?"
"204987124-0-33272";"What did Graccus want from you?"
"204987124-0-33273";"What ruins are these?"
"204987124-0-33274";"You aren't a vampire, at least not as I am. But you have changed. The relic is corrupted."
"204987124-0-33276";"You and the others. You need to get away from the relic. It's doing something to you."
"204987124-0-33277";"Stibbons … is that you?"
"204987124-0-33278";"Let's find this Cadwell."
"204987124-0-33280";"It's just …."
"204987124-0-33281";"Lady Laurent?"
"204987124-0-33282";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-33283";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-33285";"Sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-33287";"You want my heart?"
"204987124-0-33288";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-33289";"Cloudless skies scare the peepers away."
"204987124-0-33291";"It seems extreme."
"204987124-0-33292";"What if he doesn't show?"
"204987124-0-33294";"I'm ready to begin."
"204987124-0-33297";"It sounds extreme."
"204987124-0-33300";"I understand."
"204987124-0-33307";"Once yellow, it grew jealous of its neighbors. I hear it stole the red skin."
"204987124-0-33309";"I want to meet with <<1>>."
"204987124-0-33310";"You want me to kill him?"
"204987124-0-33348";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-33349";"How do I get to your Hunting Grounds?"
"204987124-0-33351";"All right. I'm ready to face the aspects."
"204987124-0-33352";"I'll do it."
"204987124-0-33354";"All right."
"204987124-0-33355";"How long will that take?"
"204987124-0-33357";"I will."
"204987124-0-33362";"What else can you tell me about Montclair himself?"
"204987124-0-33363";"What else can you tell me about Montclair himself?"
"204987124-0-33364";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-33366";"I'll open the cell."
"204987124-0-33367";"It's good of you to be here to support the Champions, then."
"204987124-0-33372";"Did you find the relic?"
"204987124-0-33376";"Where are these Orc's Finger Ruins?"
"204987124-0-33397";"That's a long wish list."
"204987124-0-33399";"Where are these Orc's Finger Ruins?"
"204987124-0-33400";"So how do we stop Montclair?"
"204987124-0-33403";"Let's go find Gwendis and the others."
"204987124-0-33404";"The one who turned you?"
"204987124-0-33406";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-33407";"How does this business opportunity work?"
"204987124-0-33408";"Sounds like bandits."
"204987124-0-33411";"Will you show me where these bandits are so I can join them too?"
"204987124-0-33412";"Sounds like bandits."
"204987124-0-33413";"What are your options?"
"204987124-0-33414";"How does this business opportunity work?"
"204987124-0-33416";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-33417";"Where is this place?"
"204987124-0-33420";"Where is this place?"
"204987124-0-33426";"Why has it been delayed?"
"204987124-0-33427";"What's a ratification ceremony?"
"204987124-0-33428";"With all that's happening, why did <<1>> offer to build the Khajiit an embassy?"
"204987124-0-33430";"You disagree with <<1>>'s plans?"
"204987124-0-33432";"What's a ratification ceremony?"
"204987124-0-33436";"Why isn't the Khajiit Embassy constructed yet?"
"204987124-0-33437";"<<1>> says it was your responsibility."
"204987124-0-33439";"Where are the supplies?"
"204987124-0-33440";"Why don't you handle this yourself?"
"204987124-0-33441";"Why don't you handle this yourself?"
"204987124-0-33442";"Why don't you handle this yourself?"
"204987124-0-33445";"You make a compelling argument. Here's the ring."
"204987124-0-33448";"You make a compelling argument. Here's the ring."
"204987124-0-33452";"You're right, it shouldn't be sold. Here's the ring."
"204987124-0-33456";"Then why are you here?"
"204987124-0-33465";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-33468";"What do you think is happening in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-33469";"You don't seem concerned about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-33470";"That's not going to happen."
"204987124-0-33472";"Let's hope."
"204987124-0-33476";"You're ready, Khali. You can do this. Just one more step on the path."
"204987124-0-33477";"Let's take that last step."
"204987124-0-33478";"What now, Mane?"
"204987124-0-33481";"Bright Moons, Khali."
"204987124-0-33482";"She didn't give me any orders."
"204987124-0-33483";"What kind of emergency?"
"204987124-0-33484";"I really need to get into that storeroom."
"204987124-0-33487";"How did you get out of Senalana?"
"204987124-0-33490";"I'm glad you're safe."
"204987124-0-33491";"Just keep the Baron and the Countess safe."
"204987124-0-33493";"These buildings are stone. They won't burn."
"204987124-0-33495";"You're welcome. Burn away."
"204987124-0-33503";"What happened at the battle?"
"204987124-0-33508";"How can I do that?"
"204987124-0-33518";"<<1>>? The Master of Portals?"
"204987124-0-33521";"What else can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-33522";"What's so special about this Emerald Chalice?"
"204987124-0-33523";"Who is Malofar? Why would he steal the chalice?"
"204987124-0-33524";"Who is Malofar? Why would he steal the chalice?"
"204987124-0-33528";"Why did the king send you?"
"204987124-0-33531";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-33535";"A wyress?"
"204987124-0-33536";"Should you send word to the queen that you're alive?"
"204987124-0-33537";"Is your father going to be entombed here?"
"204987124-0-33538";"Is your father going to be entombed here?"
"204987124-0-33539";"Then who did this?"
"204987124-0-33540";"<<1>> left <<Ac:2>> earlier, after I questioned her."
"204987124-0-33541";"Deal with it how?"
"204987124-0-33543";"What's the plan if we find her?"
"204987124-0-33546";"What are the Glenmoril Wyrd?"
"204987124-0-33548";"I don't understand. Why are you talking like this?"
"204987124-0-33549";"You're giving the Lightless Remnant to Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-33552";"There must be another way."
"204987124-0-33554";"I'll get it done."
"204987124-0-33555";"No. Reezal-Jul escaped."
"204987124-0-33556";"Will the undead respond to your command?"
"204987124-0-33557";"Will the undead respond to your command?"
"204987124-0-33558";"I'll go speak to Dame Valyrie."
"204987124-0-33559";"It said you should trust your instincts to guide you."
"204987124-0-33562";"But what do you need the inscriptions for?"
"204987124-0-33563";"Your father is still alive. Here, take his ring."
"204987124-0-33564";"<<1>>. He's the Vinedusk Ranger who holds your father."
"204987124-0-33565";"Plan? What plan?"
"204987124-0-33566";"First, tell me where to find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-33568";"Dousing them in oil and lighting it on fire worked well."
"204987124-0-33571";"He took the Lightless Remnant to Coldharbour. It was the only way."
"204987124-0-33572";"Verandis wouldn't have wanted that."
"204987124-0-33574";"He did what he set out to do. He saved Rivenspire."
"204987124-0-33575";"Lyris Titanborn? Who is that? I don't understand …."
"204987124-0-33576";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-33577";"Don't call in the Thalmor. Allow the Hollow Moon to continue its operations in Redfur."
"204987124-0-33578";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-33581";"Of course. I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-33588";"What happened to Sirdor and the others?"
"204987124-0-33589";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-33626";"What do you suggest then?"
"204987124-0-33627";"Shouldn't I take you to the prince first?"
"204987124-0-33628";"What will happen to Master Pellingare?"
"204987124-0-33630";"Did you ever find the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-33632";"What kind of a gesture are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-33633";"What happened to Malofar's clan?"
"204987124-0-33634";"How did you end up as a Goblin?"
"204987124-0-33635";"Is there a way to turn you back?"
"204987124-0-33636";"What happened to Malofar's clan?"
"204987124-0-33637";"Someone in the Mages Guild must know how to reverse the enchantment."
"204987124-0-33638";"What happened to Malofar's clan?"
"204987124-0-33639";"But?"
"204987124-0-33640";"Why did they do this?"
"204987124-0-33641";"Why did they do this?"
"204987124-0-33646";"Yes. I'll go cleanse the mausoleums and then return here."
"204987124-0-33648";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-33649";"Tell me how to stop the constructs."
"204987124-0-33651";"What kind of business were you two in together?"
"204987124-0-33652";"That sounds kind of dangerous."
"204987124-0-33653";"Why are you doing this?"
"204987124-0-33654";"How do we destroy the relic?"
"204987124-0-33655";"I defeated <<1>>. Surrender, or I'll show you exactly how I did it."
"204987124-0-33657";"If that were true, how could I have this ring? Here, take it."
"204987124-0-33658";"I see. And that brought you here?"
"204987124-0-33661";"Why would you say he's finished with your partnership?"
"204987124-0-33668";"Go on then. Get back to your side of the ruins."
"204987124-0-33670";"No. It's not safe. You should run."
"204987124-0-33672";"Go on then."
"204987124-0-33674";"Get going then. Get back to Lorelia."
"204987124-0-33679";"I captured <<1>>."
"204987124-0-33684";"Unless you put on that ring, you'll never know if I'm lying."
"204987124-0-33686";"Yes, besides that."
"204987124-0-33687";"Will you come in this cave with me?"
"204987124-0-33688";"How can we do that?"
"204987124-0-33690";"Then we'd better get started."
"204987124-0-33691";"What do you hope to learn here, Colors?"
"204987124-0-33692";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-33693";"Holy water just made the bloodfiends angry."
"204987124-0-33694";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-33695";"Holy water just made the bloodfiends angry."
"204987124-0-33696";"How?"
"204987124-0-33697";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-33698";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-33699";"I'm afraid I have bad news."
"204987124-0-33702";"In his journal, he said he was happy because he could provide for you."
"204987124-0-33703";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-33704";"He said he was going to … Glenumbra."
"204987124-0-33705";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-33706";"Can you tell me what this Ayleid Well looks like?"
"204987124-0-33707";"What does the Worm Cult want with this place?"
"204987124-0-33708";"I'm sorry, but Klaandor is dead. I found this journal, and his amulet, on his body."
"204987124-0-33711";"I'm sorry?"
"204987124-0-33712";"He had the vampiric blood-curse. He sought death rather than hurt you."
"204987124-0-33713";"I don't know. He said he'll be here as soon as he can."
"204987124-0-33714";"I'm sorry?"
"204987124-0-33715";"Your brother was taken by a dark spirit. I was forced to kill him."
"204987124-0-33718";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-33719";"His journal makes it sound like he saw it as a duty to hold it in the cave."
"204987124-0-33720";"Uh … he said he was going to … Vulkhel Guard. In Auridon."
"204987124-0-33721";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-33722";"What has caused the delay?"
"204987124-0-33727";"Isn't that the knights' loss?"
"204987124-0-33730";"Trolls and Orcs sound different."
"204987124-0-33734";"Where is this place?"
"204987124-0-33736";"I wasn't …."
"204987124-0-33741";"How did it get that name?"
"204987124-0-33742";"Garlic just made for a worse-smelling bloodfiend."
"204987124-0-33749";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-33750";"Infect people with the plague?"
"204987124-0-33751";"Is this an Imperial mine?"
"204987124-0-33752";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-33756";"Within seconds."
"204987124-0-33757";"Within seconds."
"204987124-0-33761";"The plague didn't spread to a burned body."
"204987124-0-33763";"Where did the Imperials come from?"
"204987124-0-33764";"The Imperials have raided more than once?"
"204987124-0-33765";"You don't remember being a statue?"
"204987124-0-33767";"So the Baandari are helping defend the camp?"
"204987124-0-33768";"So the Baandari are helping defend the camp?"
"204987124-0-33769";"So the Baandari are helping defend the camp?"
"204987124-0-33771";"What can you tell me about those bandits?"
"204987124-0-33773";"You can see the future?"
"204987124-0-33776";"What if I don't want to become a ""true hunter""?"
"204987124-0-33777";"Who is Hircine?"
"204987124-0-33778";"Do you plan to mount a counterattack?"
"204987124-0-33780";"What rumor?"
"204987124-0-33782";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-33783";"Is there some way I can help?"
"204987124-0-33784";"Is there some way I can help?"
"204987124-0-33786";"Very well. Where can I find these supplies?"
"204987124-0-33788";"You want me to talk to the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-33791";"I'll talk to him and see what I can do."
"204987124-0-33795";"I think the answer you're looking for is ""air."""
"204987124-0-33796";"""Life"" is the answer, I think."
"204987124-0-33797";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-33798";"What about taking the fight to the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-33799";"Are you paying the Baandari for their assistance?"
"204987124-0-33800";"Are you paying the Baandari for their assistance?"
"204987124-0-33802";"Is that all?"
"204987124-0-33805";"I will. Do you know where she might have taken him?"
"204987124-0-33809";"Any idea where we can find a key?"
"204987124-0-33811";"Once you're free, take the key and free the others."
"204987124-0-33816";"Then get clear. Things will get rough."
"204987124-0-33826";"If <<1>> won't take you to Oblivion, I'll send you there myself."
"204987124-0-33829";"Who?"
"204987124-0-33830";"Where's <<1>> now?"
"204987124-0-33831";"Where is she?"
"204987124-0-33835";"Yes, why?"
"204987124-0-33836";"You can count on me, Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-33837";"Come with me to the Orrery, then, and we'll find out."
"204987124-0-33839";"Let's go."

"204987124-0-33842";"Let's go."

"204987124-0-33844";"Jode's Chariot?"
"204987124-0-33846";"Tell me about the aspect of strength."

"204987124-0-33856";"I'll stop you."
"204987124-0-33858";"As a final challenge, Hircine ordered me to fight him."
"204987124-0-33860";"I'll be back once I've dealt with Brinarch."
"204987124-0-33861";"How will killing them help?"
"204987124-0-33862";"What do these wards do?"
"204987124-0-33863";"Do the wards do anything else?"
"204987124-0-33864";"Why is the grotto guarded by bears?"
"204987124-0-33865";"Why is the grotto guarded by bears?"
"204987124-0-33866";"Can't you drive the thunderbugs back out?"
"204987124-0-33868";"Why do you think Tulira will help us?"
"204987124-0-33869";"I'll do it."
"204987124-0-33871";"You don't believe in Wylon's plan?"
"204987124-0-33878";"What sort of faults?"
"204987124-0-33879";"What about the Hollow Moon?"
"204987124-0-33880";"How is Valenwood different from Senchal?"
"204987124-0-33882";"Tell me your story, spirit."
"204987124-0-33883";"Why did the Architect imprison you here?"
"204987124-0-33885";"If we start fighting, a sunken ship will be the least of your worries."
"204987124-0-33887";"Can you tell me more about Brackenleaf's Briars?"
"204987124-0-33888";"Because I have an army. When I open the city, things can go back to the way they were."
"204987124-0-33889";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-33893";"Will you be safe here?"
"204987124-0-33895";"All right."
"204987124-0-33900";"Can you tell me more about the necromancers?"
"204987124-0-33918";"All right. Get going then. I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-33920";"I'll find your remains."
"204987124-0-33922";"Let me take care of this. I can save the entire city."
"204987124-0-33925";"I have an army. Who do you think is better equipped to handle this?"
"204987124-0-33927";"Are you talking about the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-33930";"It's just …."
"204987124-0-33932";"That sounds harsh."
"204987124-0-33933";"I'm ready to go to Sentinel."
"204987124-0-33934";"If he puts them on trial, the king shows he doesn't fear the Blacksap. It makes him look stronger."
"204987124-0-33935";"All right."
"204987124-0-33936";"He hasn't racked up any more debt with S'rashi, has he?"
"204987124-0-33938";"I'm ready to go to Sentinel."
"204987124-0-33940";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-33942";"Then let's head inside."
"204987124-0-33947";"Why did he do this?"
"204987124-0-33950";"What were you saying about that structure up ahead?"
"204987124-0-33951";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-33954";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-33956";"I'll burn the boats and come back."

"204987124-0-33966";"What did you teach?"
"204987124-0-33968";"I'll talk to her, then."
"204987124-0-33970";"With what?"
"204987124-0-33971";"Yarah told me to bring them to you."
"204987124-0-33973";"Who am I looking for?"

"204987124-0-33975";"I bring you this."
"204987124-0-33978";"Why doesn't she trust me?"
"204987124-0-33979";"One more thing … I was told to tell you that the red asp lives."
"204987124-0-33982";"All right. Lead on."
"204987124-0-33993";"I really need it. Besides, why would you want to hang on to a smelly, old fish?"
"204987124-0-33994";"A prize catch? Wouldn't you want such a noble fish to help me find a lost pet?"

"204987124-0-34194";"All right, I'll follow you inside. But no tricks."
"204987124-0-34196";"If I believed you, what should I do about Izzara?"
"204987124-0-34197";"I'll consider it."
"204987124-0-34199";"I'll think on it."
"204987124-0-34200";"How do we strengthen the lock?"

"204987124-0-34203";"What happened after you were ambushed?"
"204987124-0-34204";"What do you know about Ranser's War?"
"204987124-0-34205";"What can you tell me about House Montclair?"

"204987124-0-34214";"Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-34215";"What happened to the nobles?"
"204987124-0-34218";"I need to find him. Can you help?"
"204987124-0-34220";"I could inquire about the shipment for you."
"204987124-0-34221";"Here is an offering. Please begin."
"204987124-0-34222";"How do I prove myself worthy?"

"204987124-0-34267";"Where is it now?"
"204987124-0-34269";"I'll tell him."
"204987124-0-34270";"Perhaps I should tell the Baron and the Countess you were spying on them?"
"204987124-0-34271";"Daedric Anchors?"
"204987124-0-34273";"It was confiscated for public safety."
"204987124-0-34274";"You're having issues with shipping your supplies?"
"204987124-0-34276";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-34277";"Sounds serious. And you said you're recruiting?"
"204987124-0-34278";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-34279";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-34281";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-34283";"When I picked it up, I was attacked by a kwama."
"204987124-0-34287";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-34289";"So your supplies are sitting on the docks of <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-34290";"Does that mean you don't want it?"
"204987124-0-34291";"Is there anything that would help?"
"204987124-0-34293";"<<1>> turned you into a statue."
"204987124-0-34297";"What if I brought you <<mz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-34301";"She's at your camp. She sent me to find you."
"204987124-0-34303";"<<1>> is still missing."
"204987124-0-34306";"What tales did you plan to tell?"
"204987124-0-34307";"These statues are Ayleids?"
"204987124-0-34308";"If you can't leave, how will you find any stories?"
"204987124-0-34310";"I'll see what I can find in <<1>>."
"204987124-0-34311";"You said you can help me?"
"204987124-0-34319";"Many people have died, but I think the city is safe now."
"204987124-0-34321";"Gather the nobles and head outside."
"204987124-0-34327";"You haven't tried throwing rocks yet?"
"204987124-0-34331";"You're welcome. Throw away."

"204987124-0-34366";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-34367";"Why did you use your own bones to make <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-34368";"How do I know you won't leave this place?"
"204987124-0-34369";"All right."
"204987124-0-34374";"Why shouldn't I set your son's spirit free?"
"204987124-0-34379";"How does <<1>> connect to the Walking City?"
"204987124-0-34381";"What if I retrieved your trunk?"
"204987124-0-34382";"If you're here, what became of the Spearhead?"
"204987124-0-34383";"Why would <<1>> want it?"
"204987124-0-34384";"You seem eager to find the Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-34385";"Tell me more about Naruk."
"204987124-0-34386";"So you're working for King Fahara'jad now?"
"204987124-0-34387";"How can you help me within the inner vault?"
"204987124-0-34389";"I don't mind. I'll retrieve your supplies."
"204987124-0-34390";"It's time to go, Gwendis."
"204987124-0-34391";"I see you managed to get everyone out of there."
"204987124-0-34393";"We should get back to Shornhelm."
"204987124-0-34394";"You're going to take their research and say that it's yours?"
"204987124-0-34395";"If we retake the city, who would get it?"
"204987124-0-34396";"Why did she mock your advances?"
"204987124-0-34397";"What kind of place is Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-34398";"So you retrieved <<1>> for the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-34400";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-34403";"When will I see you again?"
"204987124-0-34406";"Can you tell me more about Septima Tharn?"
"204987124-0-34407";"Daedric Anchor?"
"204987124-0-34409";"<<1>> is controlling you. You're a Dominion general—snap out of it!"
"204987124-0-34410";"So you're working for King Fahara'jad now?"
"204987124-0-34411";"So you're working for King Fahara'jad now?"
"204987124-0-34413";"Soul Shriven?"
"204987124-0-34414";"I'm not Arrowhead. Could that be a name for Captain Kaleen?"
"204987124-0-34415";"What kind of place is Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-34416";"How have you been, Lerisa?"
"204987124-0-34417";"Yes. Any idea how to find her?"
"204987124-0-34418";"How have you been, Lerisa?"
"204987124-0-34419";"What does the Nereid want to do with it?"
"204987124-0-34420";"How's your crew doing?"
"204987124-0-34421";"How is Jakarn doing?"
"204987124-0-34422";"Have you heard anything from Neramo?"
"204987124-0-34423";"Does he have a chance?"
"204987124-0-34425";"How is Jakarn doing?"
"204987124-0-34427";"Where are the ruins you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-34429";"Let's move out."
"204987124-0-34430";"I'm here to help Captain Kaleen."
"204987124-0-34431";"What do you know about Naruk?"
"204987124-0-34432";"Any idea how to find her?"
"204987124-0-34436";"Did you see where they went?"
"204987124-0-34440";"Would this refresh your memory?"
"204987124-0-34441";"So you trusted him?"
"204987124-0-34442";"Garron died in these sewers. I was there."
"204987124-0-34443";"<Replace <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-34446";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-34447";"Well, I slayed the Daedra."
"204987124-0-34449";"I need to move on."
"204987124-0-34451";"Izzara may be there."
"204987124-0-34452";"You said that was fine."
"204987124-0-34455";"And you're studying one of those variations?"
"204987124-0-34456";"You called this a dreadful place. You don't like it here?"
"204987124-0-34457";"I met your children when they were alive. This is how they were."
"204987124-0-34458";"What's so special about these fragments?"
"204987124-0-34459";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-34461";"What's Naruk planning?"
"204987124-0-34462";"Let me help you up."
"204987124-0-34463";"Wasn't Naruk a Covenant spy? Why would he do that?"
"204987124-0-34466";"Summoning ritual?"
"204987124-0-34468";"All right."
"204987124-0-34470";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-34471";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-34473";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-34474";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-34476";"All right. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-34478";"I'd like to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-34480";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-34481";"No. Mark his location on my map and go deal with the poison."
"204987124-0-34484";"Can't you be a little less obscure?"
"204987124-0-34485";"Why haven't you already secured this knowledge?"
"204987124-0-34486";"These other seekers serve Hermaeus Mora as well?"
"204987124-0-34487";"These ruins were once a shrine?"
"204987124-0-34488";"What does this mean?"
"204987124-0-34489";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-34493";"What exactly are we trying to do here?"
"204987124-0-34496";"<Give her the Sword of the High King.>"
"204987124-0-34497";"And so what exactly are we trying to do now?"
"204987124-0-34504";"How do you recommend we proceed?"
"204987124-0-34506";"Didn't <<1>> come back to find you?"
"204987124-0-34508";"Do you think you can walk?"
"204987124-0-34509";"Didn't <<1>> come back to find you?"
"204987124-0-34510";"A spider near your camp bit Azei."
"204987124-0-34511";"He's safe now, and so are you."
"204987124-0-34513";"Be careful. Azei was bitten by a spider near your camp."
"204987124-0-34514";"<<1>> wanted me to find the shipment for his client."
"204987124-0-34515";"Where is it now?"
"204987124-0-34516";"I'll look for the shipment."
"204987124-0-34517";"I captured <<1>>."
"204987124-0-34520";"Why would they capture your disciples?"
"204987124-0-34522";"I will free your people, but I promise nothing more."
"204987124-0-34527";"I'm sure the Mages Guild would be interested in this."
"204987124-0-34528";"What do you two sell?"
"204987124-0-34530";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-34531";"Have you any idea which way he went?"
"204987124-0-34532";"Nobody suspected the fire was deliberate?"
"204987124-0-34533";"That sounds like a scam."
"204987124-0-34534";"Isn't <<1>> just a ruin?"
"204987124-0-34535";"Why did <<1>> run off?"
"204987124-0-34536";"What do you two sell?"
"204987124-0-34537";"What do you two sell?"
"204987124-0-34539";"Let's find him."
"204987124-0-34541";"How do you differ?"
"204987124-0-34543";"Please do. I'm interested."
"204987124-0-34544";"Happy to help. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-34545";"Anchors?"
"204987124-0-34547";"What's the reward?"
"204987124-0-34548";"I'm ready to join up."
"204987124-0-34549";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-34551";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-34553";"Why did you come here?"
"204987124-0-34556";"What was that?"
"204987124-0-34557";"They did?"
"204987124-0-34558";"Go on."
"204987124-0-34559";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-34561";"So they named the city after him?"
"204987124-0-34562";"What dangerous secret is that?"
"204987124-0-34563";"If you're running from Daedra, isn't this a bad place to loiter around?"
"204987124-0-34564";"What's all this about vampire skeevers?"
"204987124-0-34565";"How do you know if it exists?"
"204987124-0-34566";"Why did you come here?"
"204987124-0-34567";"This place is overrun with Daedra. Doesn't that concern you?"
"204987124-0-34568";"How do memories turn into water?"
"204987124-0-34569";"So that's why they can't remember anything?"
"204987124-0-34570";"What's so bad about the Water Stone?"
"204987124-0-34572";"So you think the Nereid should be killed?"
"204987124-0-34575";"I certainly hope so."
"204987124-0-34577";"The other disciples made this sacrifice willingly too?"
"204987124-0-34578";"Wait. What is this altar, anyway?"
"204987124-0-34579";"So you realize what she's doing, and you still support her?"
"204987124-0-34581";"I want to help. Where is Lorelia?"
"204987124-0-34585";"Can you tell me more about what's happened?"
"204987124-0-34587";"Why would there be Imperial troops in Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-34588";"How so?"
"204987124-0-34590";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-34591";"Very well. What are you and your brother seething and simmering about?"
"204987124-0-34592";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-34593";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-34594";"I understand, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-34598";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-34600";"<<1>> needs it for her ratification ceremony."
"204987124-0-34601";"What's so interesting about that?"
"204987124-0-34603";"I'm looking for <<Ac:1>>."
"204987124-0-34604";"What can you tell me about <<Ac:1>>?"
"204987124-0-34605";"I'll plant the false orders after I secure the <<1>>."
"204987124-0-34606";"What were you doing in the ruins?"
"204987124-0-34608";"She?"
"204987124-0-34612";"You say she's a mage?"
"204987124-0-34613";"What did she say when you told her what happened?"
"204987124-0-34614";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-34615";"Remind me."
"204987124-0-34616";"So you think that Mephala is behind this?"
"204987124-0-34617";"Can you tell me more about these focus stones?"
"204987124-0-34618";"So the focus stones are keeping it together?"
"204987124-0-34619";"Is this really as simple as you're making it out to be?"
"204987124-0-34620";"But you'll see him?"
"204987124-0-34623";"At least Anexiel is defeated."
"204987124-0-34625";"You did all you could to save her."
"204987124-0-34626";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-34628";"So there was no greater plot?"
"204987124-0-34631";"I'll talk to him and see what I can do."
"204987124-0-34632";"So why didn't you leave?"
"204987124-0-34633";"How?"
"204987124-0-34635";"Why not just apologize?"
"204987124-0-34636";"You don't seem that emotional to me."
"204987124-0-34637";"Is there some way I can get your emotions back?"
"204987124-0-34638";"I'll give it my best."
"204987124-0-34639";"Let Hazzi go."
"204987124-0-34644";"I'm actually looking to help <<1>>."
"204987124-0-34646";"Don't die while I'm gone."
"204987124-0-34647";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-34650";"Can you tell me more about what happened?"
"204987124-0-34651";"So what is really going on?"
"204987124-0-34652";"Nedras joined a gang of bandits, and died trying to rob someone."
"204987124-0-34654";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-34655";"What's going to happen when you swear your oath?"
"204987124-0-34656";"What if it was just a joke?"
"204987124-0-34658";"What will become of your disciples?"
"204987124-0-34659";"What about their memories?"
"204987124-0-34660";"What will you do once you have the Water Stone?"
"204987124-0-34661";"What will you do once you have the Water Stone?"
"204987124-0-34662";"What is the Dragonstar Caravan Company?"
"204987124-0-34663";"How much did these refugees pay?"
"204987124-0-34664";"Where exactly are you taking them?"
"204987124-0-34665";"What is the Dragonstar Caravan Company?"
"204987124-0-34666";"Where did the refugees come from?"
"204987124-0-34667";"I'll make sure to find it for you."
"204987124-0-34669";"So they took your promissory note."
"204987124-0-34670";"What's wrong with the Caravan Company?"
"204987124-0-34672";"And the Imperials took your promissory note."
"204987124-0-34673";"Where was your home?"
"204987124-0-34674";"Why doesn't your father care?"
"204987124-0-34676";"Where was your home?"
"204987124-0-34677";"You're a sailor?"
"204987124-0-34679";"All right. I'll bring the Water Stone to Apostle Marian."
"204987124-0-34689";"Where did Buttons come from?"
"204987124-0-34690";"Yes. Tell me everything. You need to release this."
"204987124-0-34692";"Who is this Prophet?"
"204987124-0-34693";"So he came here hoping to win a lot of gold?"
"204987124-0-34694";"Then how are we having this conversation?"
"204987124-0-34695";"If I'm dead, who killed me?"
"204987124-0-34696";"If I'm dead, who killed me?"
"204987124-0-34697";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-34699";"Are you dead, too?"
"204987124-0-34700";"Who is this Prophet?"
"204987124-0-34701";"What is this place? Where am I?"
"204987124-0-34702";"Why did he come here to gamble?"
"204987124-0-34703";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-34704";"Maybe if you stop talking about it, you'll feel better."
"204987124-0-34706";"Why are you so worried?"
"204987124-0-34707";"How do I fill <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-34709";"Thank you, Azum."
"204987124-0-34710";"Most ideas usually do."
"204987124-0-34711";"You called out the militia on your own town?"
"204987124-0-34714";"For that he swore an oath of vengeance?"
"204987124-0-34715";"Who are the Oathbound?"
"204987124-0-34716";"Bad luck for the Orcs."
"204987124-0-34718";"Where do you suggest I start looking?"
"204987124-0-34719";"I'll go search the Imperial encampment then."
"204987124-0-34720";"What can you tell me about the temple?"
"204987124-0-34721";"Why isn't it used anymore?"
"204987124-0-34723";"Anything I should know about the Imperials' defenses?"
"204987124-0-34727";"This is all that's left of your forces?"
"204987124-0-34728";"How else can I prove I am Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34730";"Why do you find these vampires to be unusual?"
"204987124-0-34732";"I'm sorry the constable betrayed the town."
"204987124-0-34733";"Your wife?"
"204987124-0-34734";"Why did you have to get Izzara to help you?"
"204987124-0-34737";"Do you know where I can find Septima Tharn?"
"204987124-0-34738";"All right. Where do I find these heroes?"
"204987124-0-34739";"I'll go look for Frandar then."
"204987124-0-34741";"Won't you care if I imprison you in <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-34742";"Sure, here you go."
"204987124-0-34745";"Tell me about another monster."
"204987124-0-34746";"What do I get for being one of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34748";"This one's on me."
"204987124-0-34752";"Why is Montclair doing this?"
"204987124-0-34753";"What can you tell me about <<1>> and <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-34754";"Do you think Montclair seriously wants to start a war?"
"204987124-0-34755";"Do you and Baron Dorell argue a lot?"
"204987124-0-34757";"Ritual?"
"204987124-0-34758";"You mentioned Mephala?"
"204987124-0-34759";"I'll find and return the scrolls to their pedestals."
"204987124-0-34762";"All right. How do I light the braziers?"
"204987124-0-34763";"I'll light the braziers in the colors of your memory."
"204987124-0-34764";"Tell me about the rebellion's leaders."
"204987124-0-34765";"I'll choose the appropriate sword then."
"204987124-0-34767";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-34768";"You mean kill them?"
"204987124-0-34769";"Is there no other way?"
"204987124-0-34770";"Go on."
"204987124-0-34771";"To keep the ritual from taking place?"
"204987124-0-34772";"I have been misled."
"204987124-0-34773";"I'm ready. Ask your questions."
"204987124-0-34777";"Lavergne."
"204987124-0-34779";"Is there a reason he's torturing you?"
"204987124-0-34781";"Cleric."
"204987124-0-34782";"His last name was Lavergne and he was the mage."
"204987124-0-34784";"Did it work?"
"204987124-0-34785";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-34786";"Sure, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-34789";"All right. Here you go."
"204987124-0-34790";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-34795";"What was Anexiel trying to do?"
"204987124-0-34797";"Are you trying to start a fight with me?"
"204987124-0-34798";"Let's find out, then."
"204987124-0-34799";"The Undaunted? What's that?"
"204987124-0-34800";"Yes, I want to be one of the Undaunted."
"204987124-0-34801";"Umm …."
"204987124-0-34803";"What do I get for being one of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34805";"Pets are for old people and babies."
"204987124-0-34807";"I'll find her and free her."
"204987124-0-34808";"Is that all?"
"204987124-0-34809";"You mentioned insurgents? What's going on in Hallin's Stand?"
"204987124-0-34813";"Sounds like you really wanted to be the king."
"204987124-0-34815";"So it was your mother who raised such a coward?"
"204987124-0-34817";"What did she say?"
"204987124-0-34818";"How long have you been waiting?"
"204987124-0-34819";"What sort of trouble?"
"204987124-0-34821";"Why do you want me to capture your sons?"
"204987124-0-34822";"Why do you need me?"
"204987124-0-34824";"Who is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-34825";"Open the portal."
"204987124-0-34826";"Where did the refugees come from?"
"204987124-0-34827";"All right."
"204987124-0-34829";"Tell me about your work."
"204987124-0-34832";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-34833";"Where were they built?"
"204987124-0-34834";"<Use Mundus Key>"
"204987124-0-34836";"<Use Aetherius Key>"
"204987124-0-34837";"<Use Mundus Key>"
"204987124-0-34842";"How did the other vampires come about?"
"204987124-0-34843";"<Study the diagram.>"
"204987124-0-34844";"Impossible ledgers? Why?"
"204987124-0-34846";"Why do you call Arkay the Forsaker?"
"204987124-0-34847";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-34848";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-34849";"Why would you do that?"
"204987124-0-34850";"That's all they did to you?"
"204987124-0-34851";"Why would <<1>> want to meet at the site of a massacre?"
"204987124-0-34852";"Is there anything else I need to know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-34853";"Yes you do. Tell him I want to meet."
"204987124-0-34856";"Why did you ruin his reputation?"
"204987124-0-34858";"Put on the ring."
"204987124-0-34859";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-34860";"Why the change of heart?"
"204987124-0-34861";"How do we get out of here?"
"204987124-0-34862";"Does it matter?"
"204987124-0-34863";"If you put on the ring, I can lead you to him. Also your brother."
"204987124-0-34864";"How can I stop them?"
"204987124-0-34865";"Put on the ring. I'll lead you to your father."
"204987124-0-34866";"So they aren't always empowered?"
"204987124-0-34869";"I'll get the bud from the <<1>>."
"204987124-0-34870";"So you didn't know anything about this?"
"204987124-0-34871";"Yes. I already went and retrieved it for you."
"204987124-0-34873";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-34874";"Is there a reason he's torturing you?"
"204987124-0-34875";"Sure, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-34876";"Sure, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-34877";"I'll deal with the Mad Architect."
"204987124-0-34878";"All right. As you wish."
"204987124-0-34879";"How did that happen?"
"204987124-0-34880";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-34881";"How did the city fall to the Empire?"
"204987124-0-34882";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-34884";"Any other suggestions?"
"204987124-0-34885";"I need a new challenge. Any recommendations?"
"204987124-0-34886";"Where are we exactly?"
"204987124-0-34887";"How long were you trapped in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-34888";"So the clues are in the letter and on gravestones?"
"204987124-0-34889";"Can you tell me any more about the Blacklight Raiders?"
"204987124-0-34890";"So the clues are in the letter and on gravestones?"
"204987124-0-34892";"Crush faces?"
"204987124-0-34893";"I think I should buy you a drink. What would you like?"
"204987124-0-34894";"You look like a ghost."
"204987124-0-34895";"What are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-34896";"Yes, I am ready."
"204987124-0-34898";"What was the other part?"
"204987124-0-34901";"How do I know the order of the colors?"
"204987124-0-34904";"Are you coming inside?"
"204987124-0-34906";"What brings you to Wayrest?"
"204987124-0-34908";"What do I get for being Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34910";"We have the heads. Now what?"
"204987124-0-34911";"This one's on me."
"204987124-0-34913";"I have <<Az:1>>."
"204987124-0-34915";"There is a way to avoid this, Leila …."
"204987124-0-34918";"Do you think Montclair seriously wants to start a war?"
"204987124-0-34919";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-34921";"I worry that you haven't done enough research, but of course I'm coming."
"204987124-0-34923";"Why is Montclair doing this?"
"204987124-0-34924";"Do you and Countess Tamrith argue often?"
"204987124-0-34927";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-34933";"Anything else I might be interested in?"
"204987124-0-34934";"Fine. Who do you want me to kill?"
"204987124-0-34935";"This one's on me."
"204987124-0-34936";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-34939";"Your Argonian found it, not me."
"204987124-0-34940";"Any other suggestions?"
"204987124-0-34942";"The shard cured her?"
"204987124-0-34944";"Burned alive, I think."
"204987124-0-34945";"Can you remember any details that might help me?"
"204987124-0-34946";"Can you remember any details that might help me?"
"204987124-0-34947";"Any idea what I might find in there?"
"204987124-0-34948";"And if it's not?"
"204987124-0-34949";"What do I get for being one of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34950";"What do I get for being one of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34951";"Are you coming with me inside?"
"204987124-0-34952";"Are you trying to make me angry?"
"204987124-0-34954";"Umm …."
"204987124-0-34955";"Yes, I want to be one of the Undaunted."
"204987124-0-34956";"Who are the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34957";"Are you looking for a fight?"
"204987124-0-34959";"You have spies working for you?"
"204987124-0-34960";"Can you tell me anything about Reezal-Jul?"
"204987124-0-34961";"You have spies working for you?"
"204987124-0-34962";"How else can I prove I am Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34963";"Do you know of other challenges?"
"204987124-0-34964";"This one's on me."
"204987124-0-34967";"You miss them?"
"204987124-0-34968";"I can't say for certain."
"204987124-0-34969";"A letter? To the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-34972";"The Sea of Ghosts?"
"204987124-0-34977";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-34978";"You've been to the desert?"
"204987124-0-34980";"Are there creatures here worthy of fighting an Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34981";"Why don't you want your memories to return?"
"204987124-0-34982";"Are you certain you can stop the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-34984";"You think I'll find a challenge there?"
"204987124-0-34988";"Any other suggestions?"
"204987124-0-34989";"Will you help me in the Banished Cells?"
"204987124-0-34990";"He wants me to enter the tomb."
"204987124-0-34991";"What will I find there?"
"204987124-0-34992";"What are the perks of being Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-34993";"… and the other reason?"
"204987124-0-34994";"Will you go to the Banished Cells with me?"
"204987124-0-34995";"You were talking about your glorious rise to the top—anything I can help with?"
"204987124-0-34999";"Why do they call you <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-35000";"Here's your gold. Just figure out what it says."
"204987124-0-35001";"And where can I find this dust-sweep?"

"204987124-0-35189";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-35190";"I see. Have you seen or heard of anything an Undaunted should be aware of?"
"204987124-0-35191";"Tell me why nature works."
"204987124-0-35192";"What about the mortals?"
"204987124-0-35193";"What do you mean by 'chaos'?"
"204987124-0-35194";"I see. Go on."
"204987124-0-35196";"Did any of this really happen?"
"204987124-0-35197";"Too seriously?"
"204987124-0-35198";"Isn't there more to it than that?"
"204987124-0-35200";"""Was and is""? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-35204";"What's in their ruins?"
"204987124-0-35205";"You said ""treasure"" earlier."
"204987124-0-35206";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-35208";"If nobody knows, why even tell the story?"
"204987124-0-35209";"Tell me a story about the seas."
"204987124-0-35210";"Is there anything he doesn't hear or see?"
"204987124-0-35211";"How would I do that?"
"204987124-0-35212";"How does this relate to the sea?"
"204987124-0-35213";"What stories can you tell about the skies?"
"204987124-0-35214";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-35215";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-35216";"What does turning a moment on its side achieve?"
"204987124-0-35217";"I want to hear a story about Aetherius."
"204987124-0-35218";"Creating an island is a good thing?"
"204987124-0-35219";"How do the stars relate to Aetherius?"
"204987124-0-35220";"How do they twinkle and move across the sky, then?"
"204987124-0-35221";"Tell me a story about the seas."
"204987124-0-35222";"What realms do you mean?"
"204987124-0-35223";"All right."
"204987124-0-35224";"I might stay and listen."
"204987124-0-35225";"Where should we start looking?"
"204987124-0-35232";"Care to elaborate?"
"204987124-0-35234";"Remind me."
"204987124-0-35235";"Go on."
"204987124-0-35240";"Who is Hircine?"
"204987124-0-35241";"I'll find your assistants."
"204987124-0-35246";"What do you and <<1>> sell?"
"204987124-0-35250";"That doesn't seem very kingly."
"204987124-0-35252";"Very well. I'll destroy the anchors."
"204987124-0-35253";"Wickedness?"
"204987124-0-35255";"So you're not a thief anymore?"
"204987124-0-35257";"Isn't there anything you can do about it?"
"204987124-0-35258";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-35260";"You think the Dominion is up to something in Elden Hollow?"
"204987124-0-35261";"Why do you call Molag Bal the Defiler?"
"204987124-0-35262";"Why do you call Arkay the Forsaker?"
"204987124-0-35263";"Why did they leave?"
"204987124-0-35267";"How do I find Captain Blackheart?"
"204987124-0-35268";"How's that?"
"204987124-0-35270";"I guess so. Why aren't you up there if you're a member?"
"204987124-0-35272";"Where would you go?"
"204987124-0-35274";"Who's better?"
"204987124-0-35276";"So everyone here agreed to your conditions?"
"204987124-0-35277";"I want to help the village."
"204987124-0-35278";"What happens when they leave?"
"204987124-0-35279";"I can do that."
"204987124-0-35281";"All right. I'm ready to face the aspects."
"204987124-0-35282";"You mean killed?"
"204987124-0-35284";"It was a pretty big secret."
"204987124-0-35286";"You've found an unusual cure for it."
"204987124-0-35288";"I will look for the conscripted foreman, then."
"204987124-0-35290";"Will she live?"
"204987124-0-35294";"Well, I'm not. You'll just have to trust me."
"204987124-0-35295";"I will look for it."
"204987124-0-35296";"Here's the key, can I count on you to free the miners?"
"204987124-0-35297";"You'll just have to trust me."
"204987124-0-35298";"That might anger the Voice of the Forest."
"204987124-0-35299";"A Green Lady dies if her Silvenar is killed?"
"204987124-0-35300";"I'm ready to move on. Where to next?"
"204987124-0-35301";"Only once, though I had to resist the urge to drink more."
"204987124-0-35303";"Self-replenishing wine?"
"204987124-0-35304";"Self-replenishing wine?"
"204987124-0-35305";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-35306";"If you want to speak to Elara, she's waiting at the Sentinel's hut."
"204987124-0-35307";"Why are you called the Empress of Bone?"
"204987124-0-35308";"Do you want a drink?"
"204987124-0-35310";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-35311";"Will you return to Evermore?"
"204987124-0-35313";"Most of the bandits in <<1>> were drinking it."
"204987124-0-35319";"Are you a part of Brackenleaf's Briars?"
"204987124-0-35320";"And Elara?"
"204987124-0-35324";"Aranak, the merchant."
"204987124-0-35325";"Self-replenishing wine?"
"204987124-0-35326";"How did you get your name?"
"204987124-0-35327";"I can't remember anything."
"204987124-0-35328";"Such as?"
"204987124-0-35330";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-35331";"<Drink more wine.>"
"204987124-0-35332";"<Drink even more wine.>"
"204987124-0-35335";"<<1>> said you might sell me some excess wares."
"204987124-0-35336";"What sort of alchemy do you practice?"
"204987124-0-35340";"What exactly is the Viridian Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-35341";"How long ago was that?"
"204987124-0-35342";"Why do you want to kill <<1>>? Sounds like you're friends."
"204987124-0-35344";"Did they kill you?"
"204987124-0-35346";"How did she die?"
"204987124-0-35347";"Tell me about the matrons."
"204987124-0-35348";"Farewell for now, Varen Aquilarios."
"204987124-0-35349";"What happened to Abnur Tharn?"
"204987124-0-35350";"What about your role as the Prophet?"
"204987124-0-35351";"Here. Take the plans."
"204987124-0-35352";"Yes. Here. Take the plans."
"204987124-0-35356";"Sai's death must be hard to accept. Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-35357";"Will I see you again?"
"204987124-0-35358";"I'd like that. Farewell, Lyris Titanborn."
"204987124-0-35361";"Aren't you going to chase after Tharn?"
"204987124-0-35362";"Yes?"
"204987124-0-35363";"Then perhaps we'll meet on the road, some day."
"204987124-0-35365";"Farewell, Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-35366";"After I reclaimed my soul, Meridia said there were still dark days ahead."
"204987124-0-35367";"I understand."
"204987124-0-35369";"Farewell, Varen Aquilarios."
"204987124-0-35370";"Can you make it out of here?"
"204987124-0-35371";"Why aren't the draugr attacking you?"
"204987124-0-35372";"Yes, I understand."
"204987124-0-35373";"Do you know what he's after?"
"204987124-0-35375";"Sounds grim, but I'll do it."
"204987124-0-35376";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-35378";"I'll stop him."
"204987124-0-35380";"Indeed."
"204987124-0-35383";"Do you want it or not?"
"204987124-0-35384";"How do I know you won't take the diamond and run?"
"204987124-0-35386";"Your Majesty …?"
"204987124-0-35388";"I think <<1>> trusts you to put the Dominion's interests before your own."
"204987124-0-35389";"Yes. What could have delayed their embassy's construction?"
"204987124-0-35394";"Why is Cyrodiil so important?"
"204987124-0-35407";"So what did you do?"
"204987124-0-35408";"So you plan to retire?"
"204987124-0-35410";"Where do you think they came from?"
"204987124-0-35411";"So your falsified orders will send them back to Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-35412";"Why are these orders so important?"
"204987124-0-35413";"Why are these orders so important?"
"204987124-0-35414";"How did Septima Tharn get into the Chamber of Passage?"
"204987124-0-35415";"Do you live here in the Hall of Heroes?"
"204987124-0-35416";"I will. Now, hold still and I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-35418";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-35419";"How much would it cost for you to take a walk?"
"204987124-0-35423";"What else can you tell me about Montclair himself?"
"204987124-0-35425";"How much do you know about what's going on?"
"204987124-0-35426";"How much do you know about what's going on?"
"204987124-0-35428";"May the Light guide you."
"204987124-0-35430";"Did they mean <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-35431";"All right."
"204987124-0-35433";"It's your duty to face the possibility."
"204987124-0-35437";"Do you live here in the Hall of Heroes?"
"204987124-0-35438";"What were you doing up here?"
"204987124-0-35439";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-35440";"I suppose that's true enough."
"204987124-0-35442";"Try to hold still."
"204987124-0-35445";"Scent lures?"
"204987124-0-35446";"Don't you recognize me? I helped you with Lord Diel."
"204987124-0-35447";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-35448";"Why would I ever trust you?"
"204987124-0-35449";"What's a ratification ceremony?"
"204987124-0-35457";"What of my lost companion?"
"204987124-0-35458";"Do you and Baron Dorell argue a lot?"
"204987124-0-35459";"Baron Montclair is your friend?"
"204987124-0-35460";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-35463";"What about the Countess?"
"204987124-0-35464";"The Countess has a younger sister?"
"204987124-0-35465";"Dorell and Tamrith don't seem to like you."
"204987124-0-35469";"How do you know Verandis?"
"204987124-0-35470";"There must be more to it than that."
"204987124-0-35471";"Why didn't you bring an army?"
"204987124-0-35472";"What can you tell me about Crestshade?"
"204987124-0-35473";"How long will you remain in Shornhelm?"
"204987124-0-35474";"Why would he do that?"
"204987124-0-35475";"How do you know Verandis?"
"204987124-0-35476";"How do you know Verandis?"
"204987124-0-35477";"Why were you looking for me?"
"204987124-0-35480";"Why didn't you ask him to help rescue Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-35481";"You're sure you know how to do this ritual?"
"204987124-0-35487";"High King Emeric said I should trust you."
"204987124-0-35488";"Can you tell me anything that can help us deal with Montclair?"
"204987124-0-35489";"Right. Can you tell me anything that can help us deal with Montclair?"
"204987124-0-35490";"All right. So where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-35491";"Have you received any reports from Captain Janeve?"
"204987124-0-35492";"You've hinted at this before. Tell me what you're talking about."
"204987124-0-35494";"Have you received any reports from Captain Janeve?"
"204987124-0-35495";"Are you and your sister close?"
"204987124-0-35496";"To be honest, I helped them out quite a bit."
"204987124-0-35499";"Her little sister?"
"204987124-0-35500";"Can you tell me more about Jonah Marose?"
"204987124-0-35501";"What's your next step?"
"204987124-0-35502";"Are you staying in Shornhelm?"
"204987124-0-35503";"What's in this potion?"
"204987124-0-35504";"What if I choose not to drink the potion?"
"204987124-0-35505";"What's in this potion?"
"204987124-0-35506";"What's in this potion?"
"204987124-0-35507";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-35508";"Why did you take this contract?"
"204987124-0-35510";"Sounds like you've made a lot of gold."
"204987124-0-35511";"That's why you're angry at this Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-35513";"Then teach him. What will you do?"
"204987124-0-35515";"And the Orcs attacked them here?"
"204987124-0-35516";"That's what started the war?"
"204987124-0-35517";"Can you tell me more about King Ranser himself?"
"204987124-0-35518";"What is known about the battle that happened here?"
"204987124-0-35519";"What about the other basin?"
"204987124-0-35521";"Who is the Forsaker?"
"204987124-0-35522";"You want me to lie about how much work your crew did?"
"204987124-0-35523";"I have some questions."
"204987124-0-35528";"Why was the camp caught unawares?"
"204987124-0-35529";"She deserves a better fate than becoming a vampire."
"204987124-0-35530";"You're right. Let me ask Leila what she wants to do."
"204987124-0-35535";"Rest now. We'll find a solution."
"204987124-0-35536";"King Ranser went mad and General Dathieu killed him."
"204987124-0-35540";"I'm not sure, but we should gather the general's scattered bones."
"204987124-0-35541";"What ever happened between you and Lord Diel?"
"204987124-0-35544";"Of course, Leila. As you wish."
"204987124-0-35545";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-35547";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-35553";"Why aren't they here?"
"204987124-0-35554";"Will any of <<1>>'s allies witness the ceremony?"
"204987124-0-35555";"Will any of <<1>>'s allies witness the ceremony?"
"204987124-0-35557";"Who can operate <<c:1>>?"
"204987124-0-35558";"Explain what you mean by a ""divine spark."""
"204987124-0-35559";"Where can I find an Ayleid source of power?"
"204987124-0-35560";"Who can operate <<c:1>>?"
"204987124-0-35561";"How do you plan to get past the undead then?"
"204987124-0-35563";"All right. I'll take you to the tower."
"204987124-0-35564";"These circumstances seem rather familiar."
"204987124-0-35566";"Is everything going all right?"
"204987124-0-35567";"Is everything going all right?"
"204987124-0-35569";"Tell me about your tribe."
"204987124-0-35571";"What do you think of these men so far?"
"204987124-0-35572";"Tell me about your tribe."
"204987124-0-35574";"You're needed in <<1>> for the ratification ceremony."
"204987124-0-35580";"The stone isn't enough. Leila is still sick."
"204987124-0-35581";"Where are the Ayleid manuscripts?"
"204987124-0-35582";"Spit it out, Argonian, and speak plainly."
"204987124-0-35586";"So you're trapping harpies again?"
"204987124-0-35587";"And you stuck together after Lord Diel didn't pay you."
"204987124-0-35588";"Do you have a moment to talk about you contract here?"
"204987124-0-35589";"Do you have a moment to talk about you contract here?"
"204987124-0-35591";"It was an actual war?"
"204987124-0-35592";"What else can you tell me about Montclair himself?"
"204987124-0-35593";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-35596";"Who can operate <<c:1>>?"
"204987124-0-35601";"I think you've had more than enough excitement for one day."
"204987124-0-35602";"I'm sure you won't remember any of this in the morning."
"204987124-0-35603";"What about me?"
"204987124-0-35605";"But Reezal-Jul never mentioned the stone?"
"204987124-0-35606";"Your Argonian found it, not me."
"204987124-0-35607";"Your Argonian found it, not me."
"204987124-0-35608";"Leila is feeling that much better?"
"204987124-0-35609";"Lleraya, you know I never eat … food."
"204987124-0-35610";"Why was the camp caught unawares?"
"204987124-0-35611";"Are you sure that Razeel-Jul came this way?"
"204987124-0-35613";"We need to tell Wylon about this."
"204987124-0-35614";"I don't know. Perhaps there's more information in the Ayleid tomes Reezal-Jul has been researching."
"204987124-0-35616";"Of course, Leila. I'll talk to Reezal-Jul and see what he thinks."
"204987124-0-35618";"What's the Doomcrag?"
"204987124-0-35620";"What does your wife think about your decision?"
"204987124-0-35624";"Have you noticed anything strange around town?"
"204987124-0-35625";"Tell me about Bounty missions."
"204987124-0-35626";"What are Warfront missions?"
"204987124-0-35627";"Baron Montclair is your friend?"
"204987124-0-35628";"If it's called <<1>>, what do you know of Rajhin?"
"204987124-0-35629";"I want to see the Baroness healed with all my heart."
"204987124-0-35630";"Where did he go to meet the constable?"
"204987124-0-35631";"Do you have the relic?"
"204987124-0-35632";"Get the shard. I'll convince Wylon to use it."
"204987124-0-35634";"Yes, Your Majesty. I'll tell the general."
"204987124-0-35636";"When were the amethysts scheduled to arrive?"
"204987124-0-35638";"I'm sorry it's come to this."
"204987124-0-35639";"I'm sorry it's come to this."
"204987124-0-35640";"Did <<1>> enslave the Falinesti Faithful?"
"204987124-0-35642";"Where do I go to find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-35643";"<<1>> is controlling you. You're a Dominion general—snap out of it!"
"204987124-0-35644";"All right. I'll do as you ask."
"204987124-0-35645";"All right. Here it is."
"204987124-0-35648";"You want me to lie about how much work your crew did?"
"204987124-0-35649";"What'll happen if I tell the truth?"
"204987124-0-35654";"Your friend Turenn was killed by the trolls."
"204987124-0-35656";"I can open the door if you'll tell me how."
"204987124-0-35657";"What do I have to do to get it open?"
"204987124-0-35659";"Don't worry. I'll get the keys, activate the levers, and open the door."
"204987124-0-35660";"How do we get into the bailiff's room?"
"204987124-0-35662";"Whatever the case, joining the Shornhelm Guard might be a good idea. They could use you."
"204987124-0-35664";"Is that the friend he expects to vouch for him?"
"204987124-0-35668";"Do you want to know my decision now?"
"204987124-0-35669";"All right. Let's get moving."
"204987124-0-35671";"I know the truth. General Dathieu died trying to do the right thing."
"204987124-0-35672";"I know the truth. General Dathieu died trying to do the right thing."
"204987124-0-35673";"You think knowing would make a difference for Martin?"
"204987124-0-35674";"So you think Martin should enlist in the Shornhelm Guard?"
"204987124-0-35676";"Now the nobles are fighting each other?"
"204987124-0-35677";"You were nearly killed in Ranser's War?"
"204987124-0-35679";"I'm only asking because I want to help Martin."
"204987124-0-35682";"What else remains?"
"204987124-0-35684";"If Martin gets punished, I'll make sure you join him."
"204987124-0-35685";"All right. That seems reasonable."
"204987124-0-35688";"Your father was a hero. You should follow in his footsteps."
"204987124-0-35693";"Can I ask a few questions?"
"204987124-0-35694";"What if she promised to marry you?"
"204987124-0-35695";"Maybe I could go talk to her and find out."
"204987124-0-35696";"What would it take for him to win your heart?"
"204987124-0-35698";"What do you hope to find down there?"
"204987124-0-35699";"I understand Montclair and Reezal-Jul's role in all this, but what about Lleraya?"
"204987124-0-35701";"[Lie] No. Not for Julien. I'm looking to court your sister."
"204987124-0-35703";"Why did you send me to Vulkhel Guard?"
"204987124-0-35704";"I could pick these rare flowers for you."
"204987124-0-35707";"Where can we get some gems?"
"204987124-0-35709";"What can we expect down there?"
"204987124-0-35710";"What are we looking for again?"
"204987124-0-35711";"Why would they take over Northpoint?"
"204987124-0-35712";"What can you tell me about Lleraya?"
"204987124-0-35713";"Can we expect any help inside the city?"
"204987124-0-35714";"Do you know who's commanding Montclair's forces?"
"204987124-0-35715";"Why would they take over Northpoint?"
"204987124-0-35716";"Why would they take over Northpoint?"
"204987124-0-35717";"Who did Skordo take with him?"
"204987124-0-35718";"Where is Darien?"
"204987124-0-35720";"Have you found a way to get inside yet?"
"204987124-0-35722";"Have you learned anything since you've been out here?"
"204987124-0-35724";"I'll try to find Darien."
"204987124-0-35725";"Why did Lleraya seal off Northgate?"
"204987124-0-35726";"It was an honest mistake. Can't you give Julien another chance?"
"204987124-0-35728";"Actually, it's over. She wants you to leave her alone."
"204987124-0-35729";"Then you might as well enlist in the guard."
"204987124-0-35730";"Which is your sword hand, soldier?"
"204987124-0-35731";"I guess you really won't answer any questions. I guess I'll just have to cut off both your hands."
"204987124-0-35733";"I had no problem slicing Reezal-Jul. And you, my friend, are no Reezal-Jul."
"204987124-0-35734";"You sure this has nothing to do with your drinking?"
"204987124-0-35735";"In what ways are people acting strangely?"
"204987124-0-35736";"Read something from this book of poetry."
"204987124-0-35742";"What kind of work do you do?"
"204987124-0-35745";"Were you expecting these traps?"
"204987124-0-35746";"I need a poem to win a woman's heart."
"204987124-0-35749";"What do you think we're going to find here?"
"204987124-0-35750";"Explain how the veil works again."
"204987124-0-35752";"I'll buy your poetry book."
"204987124-0-35756";"Matthiaume is dead, and Edweg deserted your cause."
"204987124-0-35758";"Has there been any sign of Baron Montclair recently?"
"204987124-0-35759";"Has there been any sign of Baron Montclair recently?"
"204987124-0-35760";"Are you certain that Lleraya commands the troops at Northpoint?"
"204987124-0-35761";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-35764";"QA—LB—TestMonster^^"
"204987124-0-35767";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-35768";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-35769";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-35773";"Then you might as well enlist in the guard."
"204987124-0-35776";"It's not exactly clear yet, but they are planning to make their escape at some point."
"204987124-0-35778";"All right. I can do that."
"204987124-0-35782";"What crimes did you commit during the war?"
"204987124-0-35783";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-35784";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-35785";"Sorry. I want to hear you say it."
"204987124-0-35786";"What crimes did you commit during the war?"
"204987124-0-35787";"Have you done anything else?"
"204987124-0-35788";"But why put the door controls outside?"
"204987124-0-35789";"What crimes did you commit during the war?"
"204987124-0-35790";"Do you really think you've made amends?"
"204987124-0-35791";"But after what happened at the Tomb of Lost Kings …?"
"204987124-0-35792";"All right. I'll go free the hostages."
"204987124-0-35794";"What exactly were Althen's crimes?"
"204987124-0-35795";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-35796";"How will he be punished?"
"204987124-0-35797";"What exactly were Althen's crimes?"
"204987124-0-35798";"Why would you choose to kill him?"
"204987124-0-35799";"So you're mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-35800";"So he was acting on King Ranser's orders?"
"204987124-0-35801";"What exactly were Althen's crimes?"
"204987124-0-35802";"What do you have against the Shornhelm Guard?"
"204987124-0-35804";"So you'll keep your end of the bargain and enlist in the Shornhelm Guard?"
"204987124-0-35806";"Hasn't Lleraya paid for these crimes? She was controlling his mind."
"204987124-0-35807";"Verandis wants us to bring the army to Shrouded Pass."
"204987124-0-35808";"Verandis wants us to bring the army to Shrouded Pass."
"204987124-0-35813";"I'm ready to solve your riddle."
"204987124-0-35825";"Why is this place called the Shrouded Pass?"
"204987124-0-35826";"You said something about defenses being triggered?"
"204987124-0-35827";"How do we stop Baron Montclair?"
"204987124-0-35828";"How do we stop Baron Montclair?"
"204987124-0-35832";"Why did you take this contract?"
"204987124-0-35833";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-35834";"Then what happens?"
"204987124-0-35837";"But what if it's true?"
"204987124-0-35840";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-35841";"What do you think we'll find in the Undercroft?"
"204987124-0-35842";"What do you think happened?"
"204987124-0-35844";"Can't the other noble houses provide soldiers?"
"204987124-0-35849";"Is Lleraya more powerful than you?"
"204987124-0-35850";"You expect me to take your word for that?"
"204987124-0-35851";"That sounds reasonable."
"204987124-0-35856";"Of course."
"204987124-0-35857";"Federic insisted I help."
"204987124-0-35858";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-35859";"Did you see where they took your parents?"
"204987124-0-35861";"Listen, Arlie needs people she can rely on. You've more than proven yourself."
"204987124-0-35865";"A chance?"
"204987124-0-35866";"Did she feel the same way?"
"204987124-0-35867";"Did she feel the same way?"
"204987124-0-35869";"You don't think you still do?"
"204987124-0-35871";"What do you think we need to do with these tiles?"
"204987124-0-35872";"I'll see it done."
"204987124-0-35875";"Do you know anything about the Doomcrag?"
"204987124-0-35876";"What do you think we need to do with these tiles?"
"204987124-0-35877";"Why did you?"
"204987124-0-35878";"Get to safety. Your daughter is waiting."
"204987124-0-35880";"I'll find him."
"204987124-0-35882";"I promise."
"204987124-0-35884";"Are we ready to assault the Doomcrag?"
"204987124-0-35886";"Get to safety. Your daughter is waiting."
"204987124-0-35888";"Wenayasille?"
"204987124-0-35891";"Ask me your next riddle."
"204987124-0-35904";"Wenayasille?"
"204987124-0-35908";"Ask me your next riddle."
"204987124-0-35909";"Angalayond?"
"204987124-0-35910";"Ask me your next riddle."
"204987124-0-35914";"I'll help you however I can, Your Majesty."
"204987124-0-35915";"Angalayond?"
"204987124-0-35919";"I answered your riddles. Now will you let us pass?"
"204987124-0-35921";"Your beloved, that would be Arlie?"
"204987124-0-35922";"Where should I look for Skordo?"
"204987124-0-35924";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-35926";"I will walk with you."
"204987124-0-35927";"What can you tell me about those bandits?"
"204987124-0-35928";"Do you know who's commanding Montclair's forces?"
"204987124-0-35929";"Who did Skordo take with him?"
"204987124-0-35930";"What can you tell me about Lleraya?"
"204987124-0-35931";"Can we expect any help inside the city?"
"204987124-0-35932";"Where should I look for Skordo?"
"204987124-0-35933";"Do you know who's commanding Montclair's forces?"
"204987124-0-35936";"Stay here. Be happy with what you have."
"204987124-0-35948";"What about these statues? What are they doing?"
"204987124-0-35949";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-35950";"Protect you? From what?"
"204987124-0-35952";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-35954";"And how do we do that?"
"204987124-0-35955";"How?"
"204987124-0-35957";"You solved the riddle of Shalidor's invisible ink."
"204987124-0-35958";"Is that the only reason you're afraid of failing?"
"204987124-0-35960";"Vanus and Shalidor both have faith in you."
"204987124-0-35965";"What if I don't have a horse?"
"204987124-0-35969";"I would like to begin the race."
"204987124-0-35971";"He cared about you a great deal."
"204987124-0-35976";"Why should I give you any gold?"
"204987124-0-35981";"What happens to House Ravenwatch now?"
"204987124-0-35982";"Admirable. Will you continue to help other vampires?"
"204987124-0-35985";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-35987";"I'll find a way to reach the first portal chamber."
"204987124-0-35997";"I'll take that bet!"
"204987124-0-35998";"Then we have a deal. Where can I find your boyfriend?"
"204987124-0-36000";"Are there any other prospects?"
"204987124-0-36002";"What else does it say?"
"204987124-0-36003";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-36005";"It does look like the people are expecting that."
"204987124-0-36010";"You mean the Guardians and the Serpent aren't simply constellations?"
"204987124-0-36011";"What exactly are these Apex Stones you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-36013";"<Put the bottle away.>"
"204987124-0-36016";"And this will return the Warrior to his full strength?"
"204987124-0-36017";"Can't you tell me more about what is happening?"
"204987124-0-36018";"I've been fighting a long time. What if I were to walk away?"
"204987124-0-36019";"All right. I'll get gems from the bandits and take them to Khalisah."
"204987124-0-36020";"Can't you tell me more about what is happening?"
"204987124-0-36023";"She's after his soul, she said."
"204987124-0-36025";"I'm on it."
"204987124-0-36026";"She talked about a Mortuum … Vivicus? I don't know what that is."
"204987124-0-36027";"She said she'd take a Redguard's soul. She's going after Merric."
"204987124-0-36029";"Will do, Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-36033";"Will do, Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-36034";"Will do, Guildmaster."
"204987124-0-36035";"Can you tell me more about the necromancers?"
"204987124-0-36036";"Can you tell me more about the necromancers?"
"204987124-0-36037";"Is King Emeric not concerned about a threat in Sentinel?"
"204987124-0-36038";"The people of the Alik'r desert won't fight undead?"
"204987124-0-36040";"And where can I find this dust-sweep?"
"204987124-0-36051";"What's wrong? Have the Daedra arrived here?"
"204987124-0-36052";"Just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-36053";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-36061";"I need to know the situation. Tell me what's going on here."
"204987124-0-36063";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-36064";"I'll join you."
"204987124-0-36065";"The Celestials?"
"204987124-0-36069";"What kind of rewards?"
"204987124-0-36071";"Yes, I would like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36072";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-36074";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36075";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-36076";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36077";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-36080";"How do we get them out?"
"204987124-0-36082";"I'll see if I can help <<1>>."
"204987124-0-36083";"I want to know more about the star signs."
"204987124-0-36085";"What about the thirteenth sign?"
"204987124-0-36086";"She seems to have a lot of authority for being new here."
"204987124-0-36087";"I want to know more about the star signs."
"204987124-0-36088";"What can you tell me about Hara?"
"204987124-0-36101";"You're book hunters?"
"204987124-0-36105";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36106";"I want to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36107";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36108";"So you act as book hunters?"
"204987124-0-36110";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36111";"I want to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36112";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36129";"Did your crew disagree?"
"204987124-0-36130";"""Eyes of Akatosh!"""
"204987124-0-36133";"Where are you headed?"
"204987124-0-36134";"What is it that you do?"
"204987124-0-36136";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-36137";"Where are you headed?"
"204987124-0-36138";"Can you tell me more about the attack?"
"204987124-0-36144";"How likely is that?"
"204987124-0-36145";"What look?"
"204987124-0-36146";"Is that what happened to your shoes, too?"
"204987124-0-36147";"He said a Hagraven took his mace. And his shoes."
"204987124-0-36148";"Tell me about your mace. It has a fancy name?"
"204987124-0-36149";"I promised him I'd find the mace. Any idea where I should look?"
"204987124-0-36150";"Here's the mace. I found it on the beach."
"204987124-0-36152";"I also found your shoes."
"204987124-0-36153";"What happened to your clan?"
"204987124-0-36155";"<Take the dagger.>"
"204987124-0-36160";"Tell me more about the Hagraven."
"204987124-0-36161";"But what happened to your shoes?"
"204987124-0-36162";"I promised him I'd find the mace. Any idea where I should look?"
"204987124-0-36163";"Aren't you worried about their dead coming back to life?"
"204987124-0-36167";"Sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-36168";"Have you had to sanctify many dead bodies?"
"204987124-0-36169";"Can I ask a few questions first?"
"204987124-0-36171";"Why is Countess Tamrith so concerned with sanctifying the dead?"
"204987124-0-36172";"I saw what happened at Hinault."
"204987124-0-36173";"Have you had to sanctify many dead bodies?"

"204987124-0-36183";"Why are the wisps attacking?"
"204987124-0-36185";"Then let me look into it."
"204987124-0-36186";"I was at Fort Zeren. The Covenant entered the Fort through portals there."
"204987124-0-36187";"Can't they just open another portal if I close this one?"
"204987124-0-36188";"Why are you out here by yourself?"
"204987124-0-36191";"Thank you for your bravery, Captain. Open the door."
"204987124-0-36193";"Are you sure you're all right?"
"204987124-0-36194";"What did the Goblins do that sent you out here?"
"204987124-0-36196";"The truth. Why would I lie about Meridia's request?"
"204987124-0-36197";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-36199";"Why weren't you able to shackle Balreth?"

"204987124-0-36425";"Any idea what?"
"204987124-0-36427";"Orcs don't normally live nearby?"
"204987124-0-36430";"Tell me about him."
"204987124-0-36432";"So it seems."
"204987124-0-36433";"You called your brother the town consul. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-36434";"Grell doesn't seem to be here."
"204987124-0-36435";"Who are the Maulborn?"
"204987124-0-36439";"There's someone who can change the land itself?"
"204987124-0-36442";"What do you know about this Maulborn curative?"
"204987124-0-36443";"Can I ask you something else?"
"204987124-0-36444";"What do you suspect?"

"204987124-0-36452";"Tell me more about the Maulborn."
"204987124-0-36453";"I had some other questions."
"204987124-0-36454";"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"204987124-0-36455";"Can I ask a few more questions?"
"204987124-0-36456";"When did the Maulborn arrive in town?"
"204987124-0-36457";"What can you tell me about the plague?"
"204987124-0-36458";"What can you tell me about the plague?"
"204987124-0-36459";"When did the Maulborn arrive in town?"
"204987124-0-36462";"Where is it?"
"204987124-0-36465";"Don't worry. I'll be there when she needs me."
"204987124-0-36467";"Get going to meet your sister."
"204987124-0-36469";"Get going to meet your sister."
"204987124-0-36472";"Can I ask a few other questions?"
"204987124-0-36473";"I had a few other questions."

"204987124-0-36479";"Yes, I accept it."
"204987124-0-36482";"The note implied it protected the Maulborn from the plague husks."
"204987124-0-36483";"What crates?"
"204987124-0-36484";"I found a note. I think I know why the husks don't attack the Maulborn."
"204987124-0-36486";"You don't talk like a typical Bosmer."
"204987124-0-36492";"Daedric Anchor?"
"204987124-0-36495";"Yes. I'm ready to join."
"204987124-0-36496";"Sounds serious. Are you recruiting right now?"
"204987124-0-36498";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-36499";"I promise."
"204987124-0-36500";"You must choose this of your own accord."
"204987124-0-36501";"Are you ready to become Wilderqueen then?"
"204987124-0-36503";"Maybe the Maulborn have a real cure."
"204987124-0-36506";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-36508";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36509";"We've seen what happens to the afflicted."
"204987124-0-36510";"The plague … everything … I think the Maulborn planned for this to happen."
"204987124-0-36511";"I don't think Aerona will leave your side."
"204987124-0-36514";"All right, I'll talk to her."
"204987124-0-36515";"I won't run."
"204987124-0-36517";"He doesn't want to take the chance of hurting anyone. You need to honor his wishes."
"204987124-0-36526";"All right."
"204987124-0-36534";"Why are the Wood Elves here different from the others?"
"204987124-0-36535";"So what do you still need to investigate?"
"204987124-0-36536";"Then why hasn't something been done about them before?"
"204987124-0-36537";"Why were you sent to Greenshade in the first place?"
"204987124-0-36538";"Why are the Wood Elves here different from the others?"
"204987124-0-36539";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-36540";"Where's <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-36541";"Tell me more about your pact with the Wilderking."
"204987124-0-36543";"The Fading Tree?"
"204987124-0-36544";"No, he didn't. You're here."
"204987124-0-36545";"I dealt with the Maulborn production facilities, but I think their plans go way beyond the Serk."
"204987124-0-36548";"Is the alchemist making any progress?"
"204987124-0-36550";"I'm not sure. It certainly sounds like their plans included more than just the Serk."
"204987124-0-36551";"So you act as book hunters?"
"204987124-0-36552";"You're bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-36554";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36555";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-36556";"Sounds interesting. What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36558";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-36559";"Thank you."

"204987124-0-36563";"Tell me about the Maulborn curative."
"204987124-0-36564";"What do you know about the Maulborn?"
"204987124-0-36569";"I'm here to help. How can I fix this?"
"204987124-0-36571";"It's up to me, then. I'll cleanse the shrines."
"204987124-0-36573";"So what will you do now?"
"204987124-0-36574";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36576";"Was it the plague?"
"204987124-0-36577";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-36580";"Who ingrained you with these directives?"
"204987124-0-36582";"Regardless, that's what's best for the Bosmer."
"204987124-0-36583";"We'll have to take that risk. You can't settle here."
"204987124-0-36586";"What is a Docent?"
"204987124-0-36591";"I want to become a member of the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36592";"I'll talk to him about it."
"204987124-0-36593";"Is this always where you do your work?"
"204987124-0-36594";"You don't have your own shop?"
"204987124-0-36595";"Have you learned anything about the curative yet?"
"204987124-0-36596";"Is this always where you do your work?"
"204987124-0-36597";"You should protect the tree."
"204987124-0-36598";"Laniriel didn't know that, did she?"
"204987124-0-36601";"Are you concerned about the Valenwood?"
"204987124-0-36614";"What will the Hollow do now?"
"204987124-0-36616";"Does the Wilderking control this place?"
"204987124-0-36617";"Erunor said you would tell me about your village."
"204987124-0-36618";"Erunor said you would tell me more about your village."
"204987124-0-36619";"When will the ceremony start?"
"204987124-0-36620";"What additives do you need me to get?"
"204987124-0-36621";"What additives do you need me to acquire?"
"204987124-0-36624";"Nilyne needs it to help Ornis."
"204987124-0-36627";"Where did the undead come from?"
"204987124-0-36631";"I should add the dragon scale mushrooms now."
"204987124-0-36632";"I should add the dragon scale mushrooms now."
"204987124-0-36633";"I should add the dragon scale mushrooms now."
"204987124-0-36635";"I should take the completed potion and bring it to Nilyne."
"204987124-0-36638";"If your brethren here have turned hostile, why haven't you?"
"204987124-0-36643";"So you act as bookhunters?"
"204987124-0-36645";"What would I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36646";"I wish to join the Mages Guild, then."
"204987124-0-36647";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-36652";"Then we really are at an impasse."
"204987124-0-36654";"Here is an offering. Please begin."
"204987124-0-36657";"Here is an offering. Please begin."
"204987124-0-36661";"Why do you seek an audience with the Wilderking?"
"204987124-0-36662";"You don't remember anything about Bramblebreach?"
"204987124-0-36663";"It's not important right now. Why'd your parents leave you here?"
"204987124-0-36665";"I didn't realize how upset you were."
"204987124-0-36666";"I'm ready to see more of her past."
"204987124-0-36667";"I'm here to help you."
"204987124-0-36669";"You don't recognize any of the husks?"
"204987124-0-36670";"I've often wondered myself how exactly you control the land."
"204987124-0-36671";"Where is she?"
"204987124-0-36672";"So the Valenwood is safe now?"
"204987124-0-36674";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36676";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36677";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36678";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36679";"Will Aranias forget her previous life entirely?"
"204987124-0-36680";"Fine. Hold still and I'll undo the bonds."
"204987124-0-36681";"What exactly are these lurchers?"
"204987124-0-36682";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36684";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36685";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36686";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36687";"But I defeated him in Greenheart …."
"204987124-0-36688";"So he won't remember Bramblebreach?"
"204987124-0-36690";"Does that mean Andur is more dangerous in real life?"
"204987124-0-36691";"Attributes: Make a donation"
"204987124-0-36693";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-36695";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36696";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36697";"I'm ready to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-36698";"Singular purpose?"
"204987124-0-36700";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36701";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36702";"I'm ready to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-36703";"What do I get in return?"

"204987124-0-37891";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-37894";"Maybe Hara understood what was happening and tried to give us a clue."
"204987124-0-37896";"I'll find her, Nazdura."

"204987124-0-37900";"Not much of an army …."
"204987124-0-37904";"I guess you're in no position to help with the Celestial threat?"
"204987124-0-37905";"And what about you?"
"204987124-0-37906";"The supply train?"
"204987124-0-37907";"I see. But why pose as a mortal?"
"204987124-0-37908";"Now what?"
"204987124-0-37910";"I'm ready. Take me back to Belkarth."
"204987124-0-37912";"You didn't see your foes?"
"204987124-0-37913";"What do you know of Hel Ra Citadel?"
"204987124-0-37914";"What do you know of Hel Ra Citadel?"
"204987124-0-37915";"How did such a thing happen?"

"204987124-0-37934";"You're kidding."
"204987124-0-37935";"So why are you here?"
"204987124-0-37937";"Well, good luck."
"204987124-0-37942";"Tell me more about Kelmen Locke."
"204987124-0-37943";"How did she do that?"

"204987124-0-37947";"And then?"
"204987124-0-37949";"Yes, I'll release you."
"204987124-0-37950";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-37953";"Have we stopped the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-37954";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-38008";"So if I wanted to join the Guild …?"

"204987124-0-38025";"Circumstances?"
"204987124-0-38026";"Belkarth isn't far. You could walk it."
"204987124-0-38028";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-38038";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-38039";"Can you tell me more about the Arboretum District?"
"204987124-0-38043";"How do we defeat them?"

"204987124-0-38106";"I want to know how."
"204987124-0-38107";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-38108";"What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-38109";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-38110";"But the Anka-Ra are still out there."

"204987124-0-38112";"Tell me more about Tarish-Zi."
"204987124-0-38115";"And you think this Imperial cheated by using magic?"

"204987124-0-38118";"Any idea why?"
"204987124-0-38119";"Did they do all this?"
"204987124-0-38120";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-38122";"How do you know they won't attack again?"

"204987124-0-38128";"His dream?"
"204987124-0-38129";"How did a powerful conjurer like you manage to get captured by mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-38130";"What happened?"

"204987124-0-38163";"Can't you leave?"
"204987124-0-38164";"Really?"
"204987124-0-38165";"What's it like in the City?"
"204987124-0-38166";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-38167";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-38169";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-38186";"Where do you sail?"
"204987124-0-38192";"Are you still worried about him?"
"204987124-0-38194";"How goes the fight?"
"204987124-0-38202";"What's our strategy?"
"204987124-0-38205";"How goes the fight?"
"204987124-0-38236";"What do you mean a new crew?"
"204987124-0-38242";"Where can you take me?"
"204987124-0-38243";"All right. Take me to Khenarthi's Roost."
"204987124-0-38244";"All right. Take me to Vulkhel Guard."
"204987124-0-38246";"I'm ready to travel to <<1>>."

"204987124-0-38262";"What am I doing to the guards?"
"204987124-0-38265";"[Lie] He thinks you're better at taking bribes than following orders."
"204987124-0-38274";"[Lie] <<1>> was right about you."
"204987124-0-38283";"How did you survive?"
"204987124-0-38292";"I'd like to go to Bleakrock."
"204987124-0-38297";"You saved me?"
"204987124-0-38300";"I understand why you're a little bitter then."
"204987124-0-38303";"To Bleakrock, then."
"204987124-0-38315";"All right. Tell me what you want."
"204987124-0-38316";"What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-38317";"All right. Tell me your plan."
"204987124-0-38319";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-38320";"Tell me how you see this happening."
"204987124-0-38321";"If you say so. But how do we convince <<1>> I'm the emissary?"

"204987124-0-38323";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-38332";"Of course. Here you are."
"204987124-0-38342";"Yes, I'm ready to accompany you."
"204987124-0-38344";"After you."
"204987124-0-38345";"Thanks."

"204987124-0-38373";"How do I find whoever rescued me from the sea?"
"204987124-0-38374";"And there are others who would join me in this?"
"204987124-0-38375";"What Dominion soldiers?"
"204987124-0-38376";"You should get to safety. Head to <<1>>."

"204987124-0-38383";"What happens if I'm defeated?"
"204987124-0-38384";"How does the Arena work?"
"204987124-0-38385";"What do you mean by ""journey"" and ""first step?"""
"204987124-0-38386";"Surprises?"
"204987124-0-38387";"Champion?"
"204987124-0-38401";"I'm looking for some Imperial soldiers."
"204987124-0-38408";"All right. What's your story?"
"204987124-0-38409";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-38410";"Yes, I do. Continue your story."
"204987124-0-38411";"Yes, continue your story."
"204987124-0-38413";"I've heard of it. Go on."
"204987124-0-38414";"Are you saying your ship …."
"204987124-0-38415";"How did you sail a ship back to port without a crew?"
"204987124-0-38417";"What's the rest of your story?"
"204987124-0-38418";"Here, take this to get you back on your feet again."
"204987124-0-38425";"What will happen to you?"
"204987124-0-38426";"I'm looking for some Imperial soldiers."
"204987124-0-38427";"But their claws are sharp as daggers."
"204987124-0-38428";"What did you need my help with?"
"204987124-0-38433";"Seems like a tough way to make a living."
"204987124-0-38441";"You mentioned sellswords. Are they Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-38446";"What did she do before that?"
"204987124-0-38447";"Whose arse, exactly?"
"204987124-0-38448";"It sounds like an open secret. Why are you afraid to share it with me?"
"204987124-0-38449";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-38450";"Tell me what you know about the magistrate."
"204987124-0-38510";"Where are they?"
"204987124-0-38511";"Why do you think they're dead?"
"204987124-0-38512";"Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-38524";"Where'd they take her?"
"204987124-0-38529";"I already freed Flavinius and Sigilius. They should be safe."
"204987124-0-38586";"Troll food? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-38587";"Did you kill these two Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-38590";"But Satakal is a snake, right?"
"204987124-0-38591";"Fools? The Scaled Court plans to destroy Craglorn … maybe all of Tamriel."
"204987124-0-38593";"So you do believe in the end of days, after all."
"204987124-0-38603";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-38605";"You were freed? Why didn't you leave?"
"204987124-0-38606";"Why would he do this?"
"204987124-0-38616";"So you've done nothing to him?"
"204987124-0-38638";"Any ideas on how we might defeat Nerien'eth?"
"204987124-0-38648";"Any ideas on how we might defeat Nerien'eth?"
"204987124-0-38649";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-38650";"What did Agganor do?"
"204987124-0-38651";"The death of sun and feathers?"
"204987124-0-38652";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-38654";"What does the Scaled Court have to do with all this?"
"204987124-0-38655";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-38662";"What should we do about it?"
"204987124-0-38663";"Tell me more about Nerien'eth's ritual."
"204987124-0-38664";"And why have they come to Skyreach again?"
"204987124-0-38665";"What else can you tell me about nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-38666";"What have you seen?"
"204987124-0-38667";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-38668";"What have you seen?"
"204987124-0-38674";"Maybe he's never coming back."
"204987124-0-38675";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-38676";"Maybe Ulfonius is never coming back."

"204987124-0-38695";"placeholder"
"204987124-0-38714";"Can he be killed?"
"204987124-0-38715";"Tell me more about Nerien'eth."
"204987124-0-38738";"Why does the Scaled Court want to ally with the Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-38739";"A seat at their table?"
"204987124-0-38740";"What did they do to you?"
"204987124-0-38769";"You must have some theories about the element."
"204987124-0-38770";"Tell me more about these ruins."
"204987124-0-38771";"But why does the Scaled Court want nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-38772";"Does anyone still live there?"
"204987124-0-38773";"Tell me more about nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-38774";"Why didn't the Yokudans claim Skyreach for themselves?"
"204987124-0-38775";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38785";"How do you know him?"
"204987124-0-38787";"There's kindlepitch in the Storage House?"
"204987124-0-38789";"[Lie] No, I haven't met him."
"204987124-0-38792";"Why are you afraid to speak with Norion?"
"204987124-0-38793";"Yes, I want to return to the sanctuary."
"204987124-0-38798";"What happened to Alanwe?"
"204987124-0-38800";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38802";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38803";"You don't speak like most Altmer."
"204987124-0-38804";"What did her spell do?"
"204987124-0-38805";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38806";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38807";"You sound bitter."
"204987124-0-38808";"What happened to Alanwe?"
"204987124-0-38809";"Were you rivals?"
"204987124-0-38810";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-38811";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-38822";"I don't understand. How does that get me close to Norion?"
"204987124-0-38823";"All right."
"204987124-0-38824";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-38830";"Taara is your daughter?"
"204987124-0-38831";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-38842";"Unfortunately, I do."
"204987124-0-38844";"That just sounds … sad."
"204987124-0-38856";"Where did you come from?"
"204987124-0-38857";"Advisor to whom?"
"204987124-0-38858";"You took Emperor Leovic's corpse into the sewers?"
"204987124-0-38875";"""She?"" Who do you mean?"
"204987124-0-38876";"The contract is for Norion. Taara's brother."
"204987124-0-38877";"Very well."
"204987124-0-38878";"The contract must be fulfilled. Where is Norion?"
"204987124-0-38883";"If they look in the coffin, they'll know it's not Taara."
"204987124-0-38902";"How can I make the fire big enough to kill Norion?"
"204987124-0-38908";"[Lie] I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-38929";"Hold still."
"204987124-0-38931";"You fought them?"
"204987124-0-38932";"What were you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-38933";"What were you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-38934";"Tell me."
"204987124-0-38935";"What is the Scaled Court doing here?"
"204987124-0-38936";"What is the Scaled Court doing here?"
"204987124-0-38937";"And what puts you above the Serpent's wrath?"
"204987124-0-38939";"And what's stopping him?"
"204987124-0-38940";"You mentioned the Serpent has plans? What plans?"
"204987124-0-38941";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-38942";"I want to know more about this place."
"204987124-0-38944";"Who are you? What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-38945";"What do you think it this place used to be?"
"204987124-0-38946";"Sure."
"204987124-0-38948";"I'm untying you now."
"204987124-0-38950";"Hold on and I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-38952";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-38953";"Tell me more about the mantikoras."
"204987124-0-38954";"Who are you? What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-38956";"Progenitor mantikora?"
"204987124-0-38958";"Why does the Serpent need a new creature?"
"204987124-0-38959";"That doesn't really answer my question."
"204987124-0-38960";"What other creatures are used to create the mantikoras?"
"204987124-0-38961";"Tell me more about the mantikoras."
"204987124-0-38962";"And what's the final component in the alchemical process?"
"204987124-0-38963";"Tell me more about Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-38964";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-38965";"You said poisonous? How poisonous?"
"204987124-0-38967";"So why do you keep digging?"
"204987124-0-38968";"Red brittle?"
"204987124-0-38969";"Is there anything you can do to help her?"
"204987124-0-38971";"Nirncrux? Is that the same as red brittle?"
"204987124-0-38972";"What are you doing here, in this room, at this particular moment."
"204987124-0-38973";"What did you lose?"
"204987124-0-38974";"A hat? That's the best you could come up with?"
"204987124-0-38975";"I'm not sure about—"
"204987124-0-38977";"This sounds like an elaborate lie."
"204987124-0-38980";"More than just caravan guards?"
"204987124-0-38981";"Tell me more about the progenitor mantikora."
"204987124-0-38982";"I thought the Caravan Company had a bad reputation."
"204987124-0-38986";"They really use the mortal races to create the mantikoras?"
"204987124-0-38989";"Who's in charge of the company?"
"204987124-0-38990";"I remember! You're the company that hires thugs and rowdies."
"204987124-0-38991";"You have to admit, some of your guards are a bit rough around the edges."
"204987124-0-38992";"How has Dragonstar withstood the Iron Orc attacks?"
"204987124-0-38993";"Tell me more about the Dragonstar Caravan Company."
"204987124-0-38994";"What's that strange, red stone they're piling up outside?"
"204987124-0-38995";"Is the red brittle really worth that much?"
"204987124-0-38996";"You called the red brittle ""shake stone?"""
"204987124-0-38997";"Who's in charge of the company?"
"204987124-0-38998";"Keep it up."
"204987124-0-38999";"You're welcome. Good luck."
"204987124-0-39000";"All right. Good luck then."
"204987124-0-39004";"I don't know. Why did the miner's husband run off with the lusty Argonian?"
"204987124-0-39006";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-39007";"He was the High King's friend and he helped cause the downfall of the Nedes?"
"204987124-0-39008";"How do I find my way through such a place?"
"204987124-0-39009";"The Divines sent you to the catacombs?"
"204987124-0-39010";"You might be on a first-name basis with the Orc leaders, but diplomacy isn't going to work."
"204987124-0-39011";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-39012";"You're the leader of the Scaled Court. Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-39013";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-39014";"Tell me more about the catacombs."
"204987124-0-39015";"Why would Virmaril betray his friend?"
"204987124-0-39016";"Is this the main entrance to the catacombs?"
"204987124-0-39017";"What else do you know about Virmaril?"
"204987124-0-39018";"Don't you think the Scaled Court and the Serpent are a more immediate concern?"
"204987124-0-39019";"But the Scaled Court is evil."
"204987124-0-39020";"Who's Exarch Braadoth?"
"204987124-0-39021";"You're a member of the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-39022";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-39023";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-39024";"Can they really train trolls?"
"204987124-0-39025";"Who's Regent Cassipia?"
"204987124-0-39026";"What else do you know about Virmaril?"
"204987124-0-39027";"How in the world can an Iron Orc train savage trolls?"
"204987124-0-39028";"How do you know so much about the Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-39029";"So what are you hiding?"
"204987124-0-39030";"Where's the rest of your group?"
"204987124-0-39031";"You like this whole cloak of mystery thing, don't you?"
"204987124-0-39032";"But there's no one else here."
"204987124-0-39033";"Why are you wearing a mask?"
"204987124-0-39034";"So … you have a group to fight with you in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39035";"It certainly is … unusual."
"204987124-0-39036";"So you won't tell me your real name?"
"204987124-0-39037";"An illusion?"
"204987124-0-39038";"Why are you wearing a mask?"
"204987124-0-39039";"That's a pretty bleak view of the world."
"204987124-0-39040";"What can you tell me about the armorer?"
"204987124-0-39041";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-39042";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-39043";"What do you know about Runescriber Kulth?"
"204987124-0-39044";"Nirncrux dust?"
"204987124-0-39045";"What's nirncrux dust?"
"204987124-0-39046";"Tell me about Armorer Uthik."
"204987124-0-39047";"Tell me about Runescriber Kulth."
"204987124-0-39048";"How in the world can an Iron Orc train savage trolls?"
"204987124-0-39049";"So where do we have to go?"
"204987124-0-39050";"You're the leader of the Scaled Court. Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-39051";"What can you tell me about the other competitors?"
"204987124-0-39052";"Maybe the reward is simply bragging rights."
"204987124-0-39053";"You call yourselves the Five Claws?"
"204987124-0-39054";"There must be someone you're worried about."
"204987124-0-39055";"You haven't seen any of them in action?"
"204987124-0-39056";"You call yourselves the Five Claws?"
"204987124-0-39057";"So, he wasn't ready for this level of competition?"
"204987124-0-39058";"What kind of surprises?"
"204987124-0-39059";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-39060";"You're my … king?"
"204987124-0-39061";"Are you sure you're really a king?"
"204987124-0-39062";"You really plan to fight in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39063";"You have a castle?"
"204987124-0-39064";"I only see three of you."
"204987124-0-39065";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-39066";"Um, six and three adds up to nine."
"204987124-0-39067";"Why do you want to compete in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39068";"Imperial law?"
"204987124-0-39069";"Any idea what's inside the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39070";"With just four warriors?"
"204987124-0-39071";"You seem pretty confident."
"204987124-0-39072";"What are Imperial soldiers doing here?"
"204987124-0-39073";"So you don't think they stand a chance against your group?"
"204987124-0-39074";"What are imperial soldiers doing here?"
"204987124-0-39075";"Stone-Fish? That's the name of your group?"
"204987124-0-39076";"All that gear must be expensive."
"204987124-0-39077";"How long have you been waiting to enter the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39078";"Your patrons?"
"204987124-0-39079";"Three groups? That doesn't sound too bad."
"204987124-0-39080";"What's a Stone-Fish?"
"204987124-0-39081";"You sound a little worried."
"204987124-0-39082";"Gaining the powers of a celestial is bad?"
"204987124-0-39083";"How does the Arena work?"
"204987124-0-39084";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-39085";"You're part of the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-39086";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-39087";"But you didn't join up?"
"204987124-0-39089";"So now you're competing in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39090";"Excuse me?"
"204987124-0-39092";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-39093";"Holstagg can't do that himself?"
"204987124-0-39094";"He's just standing there."
"204987124-0-39095";"Accidents?"
"204987124-0-39096";"Will Holstagg fight in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-39097";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-39098";"Why was Holstagg crying?"
"204987124-0-39099";"So who are you again?"
"204987124-0-39100";"Why did you leave the farm?"
"204987124-0-39101";"You don't worship the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-39102";"You mean the Serpent isn't the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-39103";"Tell me more about these creatures."
"204987124-0-39104";"You're suggesting that the Celestials …?"
"204987124-0-39105";"And you believe the Nedes created these things?"
"204987124-0-39106";"I'm not sure I should trust a member of the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-39107";"What purpose did these creatures serve?"
"204987124-0-39108";"Tell me more about that Apex Stone."
"204987124-0-39109";"What about the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-39110";"What just happened?"
"204987124-0-39111";"What just happened?"
"204987124-0-39114";"What were you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-39115";"Tell me about the Celestial Serpent."
"204987124-0-39116";"Tell me about your master."
"204987124-0-39118";"What is the Celestial Serpent?"
"204987124-0-39119";"If there's a group still in the Sanctum, why are you here?"
"204987124-0-39121";"Proud enough to reward me?"
"204987124-0-39127";"If it's worth the effort. What have I earned today?"
"204987124-0-39136";"What's my reward for cleansing the grotto?"
"204987124-0-39141";"Me either. What of my reward?"
"204987124-0-39148";"And what else can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-39149";"I'm not sure I should trust a member of the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-39150";"Tell me where to find iron ore."
"204987124-0-39154";"Tell me about the larger creature."
"204987124-0-39155";"Actually, I have enough iron ingots. What's next?"
"204987124-0-39157";"You want to return to your own time?"
"204987124-0-39158";"Does it have anything to do with the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-39159";"Did Kelmen mention a name?"
"204987124-0-39160";"Tell me about this magical disturbance the Thief detected."
"204987124-0-39161";"So you have no idea what kind of disturbance we might be dealing with?"
"204987124-0-39162";"What is a style material?"
"204987124-0-39163";"What have you been doing since last we met?"
"204987124-0-39164";"Could this friend be involved in the magical disturbance somehow?"
"204987124-0-39165";"What have you been up to since the last time I saw you?"
"204987124-0-39167";"They needed help. They said they opposed the Serpent and the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-39168";"Why did Kelmen go after Cassipia by himself?"
"204987124-0-39169";"Can Cassipia really become the Serpent's equal?"
"204987124-0-39170";"I met Regent Cassipia and Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-39171";"They killed their own pets?"
"204987124-0-39172";"She collected something from the mantikoras and the armored trolls. And some of the nirncrux."
"204987124-0-39173";"Is Kelmen really dead?"
"204987124-0-39174";"I met Regent Cassipia and Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-39176";"Fun times."
"204987124-0-39179";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-39180";"Who's competing in these games?"
"204987124-0-39181";"How can an arena run with everything going on in this region?"
"204987124-0-39182";"That's a pretty dangerous assumption."
"204987124-0-39183";"Who's competing in these games?"
"204987124-0-39184";"Who's competing in these games?"
"204987124-0-39185";"So why don't you simply quit the organization?"
"204987124-0-39186";"Why is the Fighters Guild here?"
"204987124-0-39187";"I don't recall people fearing us as being part of the job."
"204987124-0-39188";"I'll dare. And I'll beat you, too."
"204987124-0-39189";"Why is the Fighters Guild here?"
"204987124-0-39190";"You're the champion?"
"204987124-0-39191";"You're the champion?"
"204987124-0-39192";"Why is the Fighters Guild here?"
"204987124-0-39193";"Tell me about the crafts you certify."
"204987124-0-39194";"I can help with that."
"204987124-0-39195";"I'll meet you at the Howling Sepulchers."
"204987124-0-39197";"Why did you come to this desolate place?"
"204987124-0-39199";"And this sword can help Titus recover his memories?"
"204987124-0-39200";"Where can I find this Iron Orc?"
"204987124-0-39202";"I'll find Skarath and retrieve the blade."
"204987124-0-39203";"So, painting is just a hobby for you?"
"204987124-0-39204";"Great story. What about my reward?"
"204987124-0-39205";"What brings you to Craglorn?"
"204987124-0-39206";"Sounds like you don't actually like it."
"204987124-0-39207";"You're not worried about Iron Orcs or the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-39210";"Are you any good at painting?"
"204987124-0-39211";"All right. Tell me how this works."
"204987124-0-39213";"Tell me about the crafts you certify."
"204987124-0-39214";"What does a woodworker make?"
"204987124-0-39215";"What do clothiers make?"
"204987124-0-39216";"What can a blacksmith make?"
"204987124-0-39217";"All right, I'll go speak with him."
"204987124-0-39221";"To each their own. What are my rewards for this adventure?"
"204987124-0-39224";"All right. Tell me what you can certify."
"204987124-0-39226";"All right, I'll go speak with her."
"204987124-0-39230";"No, I'm not."
"204987124-0-39232";"I need to go. And so should you."
"204987124-0-39233";"Sounds good. Where's my reward?"
"204987124-0-39236";"Speaking of thanks … my reward?"
"204987124-0-39239";"Did your bag have my reward in it?"
"204987124-0-39242";"Only Bogdan's slaughtered corpse. What is that worth?"
"204987124-0-39245";"What can a blacksmith make?"
"204987124-0-39246";"How did you learn blacksmithing and woodworking?"
"204987124-0-39247";"Do you think they're still alive?"
"204987124-0-39248";"Why did you think this was a good idea?"
"204987124-0-39249";"Why did you think this was a good idea?"
"204987124-0-39251";"I have some other questions."
"204987124-0-39252";"We'll find your wife, but I'm going to close that gate, again."
"204987124-0-39255";"Are you one of Fingaenion's sellswords?"
"204987124-0-39257";"The other summoned soldiers, such as Tarish-Zi, were controlled by the Serpent. Why wasn't Titus?"
"204987124-0-39259";"Did you know Titus would lose his memories?"
"204987124-0-39261";"I've defeated the Daedra, but they will return."
"204987124-0-39262";"What now?"
"204987124-0-39263";"So you found your wife?"
"204987124-0-39264";"Right. Do you have my reward?"
"204987124-0-39267";"Very much so."
"204987124-0-39270";"What do provisioners make?"
"204987124-0-39271";"What does an alchemist make?"
"204987124-0-39272";"What can enchanters make?"
"204987124-0-39273";"What do provisioners make?"
"204987124-0-39275";"How did you manage to survive here?"
"204987124-0-39281";"What does that entail?"
"204987124-0-39283";"How did you learn enchanting and alchemy?"
"204987124-0-39284";"I have some other questions."
"204987124-0-39286";"What is my reward for restoring that order?"
"204987124-0-39287";"You seem a little out of place."
"204987124-0-39290";"So you're not one of them?"
"204987124-0-39291";"What do you do around here?"
"204987124-0-39292";"Merry?"
"204987124-0-39293";"And that's it?"
"204987124-0-39294";"Thanks, I may do that."
"204987124-0-39295";"Thanks, I'll consider it."
"204987124-0-39297";"What are you writing about?"
"204987124-0-39298";"Is any of it worth listening to?"
"204987124-0-39299";"How will people see your story?"
"204987124-0-39301";"Are you a member of this group?"
"204987124-0-39302";"So it's not being published?"
"204987124-0-39303";"You seem nervous."
"204987124-0-39305";"I guess not."
"204987124-0-39306";"What would you call it?"
"204987124-0-39307";"We need to leave."
"204987124-0-39308";"Indeed. May I have my reward?"
"204987124-0-39312";"Does your commander see it that way?"
"204987124-0-39314";"You work for Isrudde?"
"204987124-0-39315";"You don't sound like you want to be rescued."
"204987124-0-39316";"What did you do to deserve a beheading?"
"204987124-0-39318";"That sounds pretty … intense."
"204987124-0-39320";"It's not the Nereids' thanks I sought. Where is my reward?"
"204987124-0-39323";"All right. Certify me."
"204987124-0-39324";"How long have you traveled with Isrudde?"
"204987124-0-39325";"Are all these goods from Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-39326";"Even the Wood Elf over there?"
"204987124-0-39327";"Are all these goods from Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-39329";"You're not troubled by taking the belongings of dead soldiers?"
"204987124-0-39330";"Looks like you have some unsavory companions."
"204987124-0-39331";"Is there anywhere I can purchase iron ore?"
"204987124-0-39332";"What kind of uses?"
"204987124-0-39333";"What's going on here?"
"204987124-0-39334";"Why not find smarter companions?"
"204987124-0-39335";"""Discarded?"""
"204987124-0-39336";"So, you make a profit from the war?"
"204987124-0-39337";"Are you the leader of this outfit?"
"204987124-0-39338";"How do you hold them off?"
"204987124-0-39339";"Are you the leader of this outfit?"
"204987124-0-39340";"That's not going to work forever."
"204987124-0-39347";"Then doesn't this complicate things?"
"204987124-0-39349";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-39350";"How is deconstruction useful to me?"
"204987124-0-39353";"What style material do I need?"
"204987124-0-39356";"If you return to your time, will your memories come back?"
"204987124-0-39357";"I will rejoice when I have my reward."
"204987124-0-39360";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39361";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39362";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39364";"Right. May I have my reward?"
"204987124-0-39371";"And when is the time?"
"204987124-0-39374";"It was a treacherous place with death around every corner."
"204987124-0-39377";"What style material should I use?"
"204987124-0-39378";"Where can I find rough maple?"
"204987124-0-39382";"What style material do I need?"
"204987124-0-39383";"What style material do I need?"
"204987124-0-39384";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39385";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39386";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39387";"What style material should I use?"
"204987124-0-39388";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39389";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39390";"How do I learn other racial styles?"
"204987124-0-39391";"What style material should I use?"
"204987124-0-39392";"I'd like to be certified."
"204987124-0-39400";"First, I'd like my reward."
"204987124-0-39403";"Where is my prize then?"
"204987124-0-39406";"Perhaps, but what has today's hunt earned me?"
"204987124-0-39409";"Actually, I have enough sanded maple. What's next?"
"204987124-0-39414";"What is a style material?"
"204987124-0-39415";"No. Certify me as a provisioner."
"204987124-0-39420";"You honor me, Glirion."
"204987124-0-39426";"Yes, I want to be certified."
"204987124-0-39428";"Where can I find raw jute?"
"204987124-0-39432";"Very well. Where should I find a recipe?"
"204987124-0-39433";"What happened to your family?"
"204987124-0-39442";"Is that different than normal Undaunted explorations?"
"204987124-0-39443";"Why will there be three of you?"
"204987124-0-39444";"So what are the rewards of taking a pledge?"
"204987124-0-39446";"I think I understand."
"204987124-0-39447";"Any other relatives?"
"204987124-0-39448";"What can you tell me about Gati?"
"204987124-0-39449";"Why did she torture you?"
"204987124-0-39450";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-39451";"You have too much treasure?"
"204987124-0-39452";"And that's what shaped your outlook?"
"204987124-0-39453";"Do I have to say an actual pledge to undertake the challenge?"
"204987124-0-39454";"What did you mean about the fragility of life?"
"204987124-0-39455";"Why are they called pledges?"
"204987124-0-39456";"All right. Why are you a member of the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-39457";"Why is the crew doing this?"
"204987124-0-39459";"Your mother is in the Undaunted as well?"
"204987124-0-39461";"Her name is very different than yours."
"204987124-0-39464";"Good talking to you, Maj."
"204987124-0-39465";"Where else can I find ingredients?"
"204987124-0-39469";"If I run out of ingredients, where can I find some more?"
"204987124-0-39471";"Actually, I have enough refined jute. What's next?"
"204987124-0-39476";"What is a style material?"
"204987124-0-39478";"Where can I find a potency, essence, and aspect rune?"
"204987124-0-39480";"You steal, then?"
"204987124-0-39481";"Tell me more about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-39482";"How do you survive in the sewers?"
"204987124-0-39483";"So, you steal to get your goods?"
"204987124-0-39484";"Tell me more about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-39485";"Tell me more about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-39491";"Where can I find solvents and reagents?"
"204987124-0-39492";"Where else can I find solvents and reagents?"
"204987124-0-39501";"How do I know which reagent traits are common?"
"204987124-0-39502";"Is there something I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-39505";"Why do you need a Dwarven power core?"
"204987124-0-39509";"How do I use glyphs?"
"204987124-0-39512";"I'll return with the ore."
"204987124-0-39514";"Is there any way to reverse the curse?"
"204987124-0-39515";"What do you need to reverse the curse?"
"204987124-0-39517";"I'll return with the items as soon as I can."
"204987124-0-39518";"How is deconstruction useful to me?"
"204987124-0-39520";"What's delaying the walls?"
"204987124-0-39521";"Well, good luck."
"204987124-0-39532";"It's just a normal whistle. Nikolvara tamed the durzogs through skill and patience."
"204987124-0-39535";"What do I owe you for the frozen egg?"
"204987124-0-39536";"What did he do?"
"204987124-0-39537";"Actually, it's for Deechee-Noo."
"204987124-0-39538";"Deechee-Noo sent me. She needs the bone for a ritual."
"204987124-0-39539";"I'll let you know if I see him."
"204987124-0-39540";"I'll let you know if I see him."
"204987124-0-39544";"I'll return with the jute, Millenith."
"204987124-0-39545";"How would I make leather gloves?"
"204987124-0-39548";"How is deconstruction useful to me?"
"204987124-0-39549";"What is a style material?"
"204987124-0-39550";"How is deconstruction useful to me?"
"204987124-0-39552";"How'd your fleet end up so far off course?"
"204987124-0-39554";"Do you think Captain Henrisa made a mistake?"
"204987124-0-39555";"How'd your fleet end up so far off course?"
"204987124-0-39556";"I'll return with the maple."
"204987124-0-39557";"What brings a Dark Elf way out here?"
"204987124-0-39558";"Is there anywhere I can purchase rough maple?"
"204987124-0-39560";"I'll return with the ingredients."
"204987124-0-39561";"She's up the hill, by the barrow."
"204987124-0-39562";"The draugr in the barrow have awakened."
"204987124-0-39565";"Creepy? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-39566";"Do you really want me to tell Deechee-Noo that you lied to avoid helping her?"
"204987124-0-39569";"And your father was the chief?"
"204987124-0-39574";"I want you to certify me."
"204987124-0-39576";"How can potions benefit me?"
"204987124-0-39577";"How do I know what traits a reagent has?"
"204987124-0-39582";"What kind of devices does Raynor make?"
"204987124-0-39583";"Where else can I find recipes?"
"204987124-0-39585";"Is there anywhere I can purchase recipes?"
"204987124-0-39586";"Is there anywhere I can purchase ingredients?"
"204987124-0-39587";"What is the difference between cooking and brewing?"
"204987124-0-39588";"Where else can I find ingredients?"
"204987124-0-39589";"How can provisioning benefit me?"
"204987124-0-39590";"What is the difference between cooking and brewing?"
"204987124-0-39591";"I'll return with the runes."
"204987124-0-39592";"Where else can I find runes?"
"204987124-0-39595";"I want you to certify me."
"204987124-0-39596";"If I can put glyphs together, can I take them apart?"
"204987124-0-39597";"That's too bad. I guess I'll have to tell Deechee-Noo you weren't willing to help her out."
"204987124-0-39600";"What sort of opportunities?"
"204987124-0-39601";"Why do you need a Dwarven power core?"
"204987124-0-39602";"I'm ready. Let's start the ritual."
"204987124-0-39608";"Other researchers haven't studied these ruins before?"
"204987124-0-39623";"What is deconstruction?"
"204987124-0-39624";"Is there anything else I should know about crafting?"
"204987124-0-39625";"How does a blacksmith improve weapons and heavy armor?"
"204987124-0-39626";"Tell me about crafting with more materials."
"204987124-0-39627";"How do I research an item's trait?"
"204987124-0-39628";"I want to know more about improvement."
"204987124-0-39629";"What can you tell me about research and traits?"
"204987124-0-39630";"What can you tell me about research and traits?"
"204987124-0-39631";"What can you tell me about research and traits?"
"204987124-0-39632";"Tell me about crafting with more materials."
"204987124-0-39633";"How did you become a master crafter?"
"204987124-0-39634";"How do I use glyphs?"
"204987124-0-39639";"Will this tell you what happened to the Orcs?"
"204987124-0-39660";"How are they supposed to set fire to nests at the top of the towers?"
"204987124-0-39661";"They grow hearts?"
"204987124-0-39663";"Defeating him will allow us to free the prisoners trapped below?"
"204987124-0-39664";"Where do you think these Orcs came from?"
"204987124-0-39667";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-39668";"What is this Gravelight Sentry?"
"204987124-0-39669";"What, exactly?"
"204987124-0-39672";"Defenses? You mean the constructs?"
"204987124-0-39673";"Doesn't King Kurog have an army?"
"204987124-0-39682";"How do you recommend I approach the fortress?"
"204987124-0-39683";"No thanks. I have news. The stolen supplies are inside the fortress."
"204987124-0-39696";"How does an Orb of Illumination work?"
"204987124-0-39699";"And what way is that?"
"204987124-0-39714";"<Read Note>"
"204987124-0-39716";"<Take Note>"
"204987124-0-39717";"That's a bold claim."
"204987124-0-39724";"I'll look for the control center."
"204987124-0-39737";"What was his plan?"
"204987124-0-39738";"Then who are all these chiefs and why are they helping Kurog?"
"204987124-0-39745";"But don't you have that control rod you made in Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-39753";"Tell me more about what happened here."
"204987124-0-39754";"Where's the chief now?"
"204987124-0-39759";"Where else can I find ingredients?"
"204987124-0-39760";"Tell me more about what happened here."
"204987124-0-39761";"What is the difference between cooking and brewing?"
"204987124-0-39762";"What can you tell me about the Winterborn?"
"204987124-0-39763";"Where do I meet King Kurog?"
"204987124-0-39764";"Why does the king have you making these arrangements?"
"204987124-0-39766";"Do you have a plan for dealing with the constructs?"
"204987124-0-39768";"Trinimac?"
"204987124-0-39770";"King Kurog is married?"
"204987124-0-39771";"How will this help King Kurog unite the Orc clans?"
"204987124-0-39772";"Why does the king have you making these arrangements?"
"204987124-0-39776";"How do we know what the correct orientation is?"
"204987124-0-39777";"Did the Orcs know they were helping you excavate a Dwemer ruin?"
"204987124-0-39778";"You know the Orcs are not happy with you, right?"
"204987124-0-39781";"Your true calling?"
"204987124-0-39782";"Where does the forge-mother fall on the matter?"
"204987124-0-39783";"I thought the Orcs worshiped Malacath?"
"204987124-0-39784";"You told him we were coming?"
"204987124-0-39785";"That works for me. Let's go."
"204987124-0-39787";"You're a follower of Trinimac?"
"204987124-0-39788";"You warned the Winterborn warlord that we were coming?"
"204987124-0-39789";"You're kind of obsessed with food, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-39792";"Tell me about these rumors."
"204987124-0-39795";"As long as you're certain …."
"204987124-0-39796";"I'm ready. Let's go."
"204987124-0-39798";"I'm not an outsider. I'm an Orc."
"204987124-0-39799";"Is that all you remember?"
"204987124-0-39800";"You don't seem that hurt to me."
"204987124-0-39801";"Tell me about the two squads you sent inside."
"204987124-0-39802";"You can't just order the chiefs to work together?"
"204987124-0-39803";"So Wrothgar isn't really your kingdom?"
"204987124-0-39804";"You're kind of obsessed with food, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-39809";"That's why she posed as <<1>>."
"204987124-0-39810";"Why did you disguise yourself?"
"204987124-0-39811";"""I needed no prayers. Only my strength."""
"204987124-0-39817";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-39822";"What about the eyes?"
"204987124-0-39823";"Are you sure they were Orcs?"
"204987124-0-39824";"Why did <<1>> decide to bring an expedition here?"
"204987124-0-39825";"But now you can't?"
"204987124-0-39828";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-39829";"<<1>> said you should return to camp."
"204987124-0-39831";"What's your issue with the Code of Malacath?"
"204987124-0-39846";"Careful there."
"204987124-0-39849";"What do you want with the crown?"
"204987124-0-39852";"Your son?"
"204987124-0-39857";"And King Kurog agrees with all this?"
"204987124-0-39858";"So you don't worship Malacath?"
"204987124-0-39859";"Why Trinimac?"
"204987124-0-39860";"Priestess in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-39861";"What's your issue with the Code of Malacath?"
"204987124-0-39862";"What's your issue with the Code of Malacath?"
"204987124-0-39866";"That doesn't seem very practical."
"204987124-0-39867";"So how did you get married if you're not the chief?"
"204987124-0-39868";"Your chief doesn't object?"
"204987124-0-39869";"Only the chief marries? That doesn't seem very practical."
"204987124-0-39871";"Do you fight for one of the alliances?"
"204987124-0-39872";"Priest Uugus and the others are safe."
"204987124-0-39873";"What was your plan in coming here?"
"204987124-0-39874";"Do you fight for one of the alliances?"
"204987124-0-39875";"What was your plan in coming here?"
"204987124-0-39880";"No. What difference does that make?"
"204987124-0-39881";"And you want my help retrieving the helm?"
"204987124-0-39883";"Are you sure the puzzle is the only protection?"
"204987124-0-39884";"All right, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-39894";"I see. What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-39898";"I will seek out Bazrag at Fharhun."
"204987124-0-39901";"But will Shatul accept you?"
"204987124-0-39905";"What should I tell <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-39922";"How can you tell?"
"204987124-0-39943";"The Riekr exhibit advanced behaviors?"
"204987124-0-39944";"Aren't you afraid they'll eat you?"
"204987124-0-39945";"Aren't you afraid they'll eat you?"
"204987124-0-39946";"Aren't you afraid they'll eat you?"
"204987124-0-39953";"Why did you sound so different when you were wearing the helmet?"
"204987124-0-39958";"Any tips for herding the echatere?"
"204987124-0-39967";"If not <<1>>, then <<2>> must become chief."
"204987124-0-39968";"What can you tell me about these fanatics?"
"204987124-0-39969";"Do you think Chief Bazrag was behind this attack?"
"204987124-0-39971";"What clan are you part of?"
"204987124-0-39976";"What's he upset about right now?"
"204987124-0-39977";"What's the Rime Hammer?"
"204987124-0-39978";"You mentioned an Overfiend? What is it?"
"204987124-0-39980";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-39982";"What happened to this prison?"
"204987124-0-39992";"Who is this Overfiend?"
"204987124-0-39994";"Why do you wear Nord armor?"
"204987124-0-39996";"What of your clan-brothers and -sisters?"
"204987124-0-39997";"Why do you wear Nord armor?"
"204987124-0-40000";"But why join the Daggerfall Covenant?"
"204987124-0-40001";"The Hunting Board?"
"204987124-0-40002";"How did you get wounded?"
"204987124-0-40003";"The Hunting Board?"
"204987124-0-40004";"Why join the Daggerfall Covenant?"
"204987124-0-40005";"Do you hate the Dunmer?"
"204987124-0-40006";"So you're a Nord fighting for the Covenant?"
"204987124-0-40008";"How were you injured?"
"204987124-0-40009";"Any advice?"
"204987124-0-40010";"Have you seen much action in the sewers?"
"204987124-0-40012";"I want to know what I'm up against."
"204987124-0-40013";"What if I free the prisoners and just walk away?"
"204987124-0-40014";"And?"
"204987124-0-40015";"What if I free the prisoners and just walk away?"
"204987124-0-40016";"You were waiting for a bodyguard to just happen by?"
"204987124-0-40018";"You'd better get out of here."
"204987124-0-40019";"This isn't some trick."
"204987124-0-40020";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-40021";"Tell me why you wanted to attack the Warden."
"204987124-0-40022";"This potion will turn you into a torchbug. You can fly to safety."
"204987124-0-40023";"This potion will turn you into a torchbug and you can fly."
"204987124-0-40024";"This potion will turn you into a torchbug. You can fly to safety."
"204987124-0-40028";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-40029";"Are you a guard?"
"204987124-0-40047";"Indeed. May I have my reward?"
"204987124-0-40054";"Your friend seems upset."
"204987124-0-40056";"You don't care that the hammer's been found?"
"204987124-0-40058";"The schematics were lost, but the engineer lives."
"204987124-0-40060";"Yes. They should be there soon."
"204987124-0-40061";"Yes. He should be there soon."
"204987124-0-40065";"Why?"
"204987124-0-40069";"I can help. What can we do about this?"
"204987124-0-40071";"I'll deactivate those stones."
"204987124-0-40074";"Do you have passion enough to give me a reward?"
"204987124-0-40077";"Something like that. I take it that's worth something?"
"204987124-0-40080";"Who is this Overfiend?"
"204987124-0-40082";"By Cultists?"
"204987124-0-40084";"I'll defeat them."
"204987124-0-40085";"And your son?"
"204987124-0-40087";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-40089";"<Step Away.>"
"204987124-0-40091";"In the Imperial City."
"204987124-0-40092";"How did you end up in the arena?"
"204987124-0-40093";"Why did you come to the city in the first place?"
"204987124-0-40094";"Why did you come to the city in the first place?"
"204987124-0-40095";"Where's Vibius?"
"204987124-0-40096";"How did you end up in the arena?"
"204987124-0-40097";"So who's in charge?"
"204987124-0-40098";"You haven't heard any rumors?"
"204987124-0-40099";"Why Chorrol?"
"204987124-0-40100";"What did you find?"
"204987124-0-40101";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-40102";"What about the two from Chorrol?"
"204987124-0-40103";"The slaughterfish didn't get you?"
"204987124-0-40104";"Where is Thracius?"
"204987124-0-40105";"What about the men from Chorrol?"
"204987124-0-40106";"Where is Thracius?"
"204987124-0-40111";"You seem pretty confident."
"204987124-0-40113";"What evidence do you have?"
"204987124-0-40114";"Tell me about this Elder Scroll."
"204987124-0-40115";"You're not helping."
"204987124-0-40116";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40117";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-40118";"Where are the other Moth Priests?"
"204987124-0-40119";"So why is there an Elder Scroll still here?"
"204987124-0-40120";"Why?"
"204987124-0-40123";"The Empress Regent was missing?"
"204987124-0-40125";"What's an Empress Regent?"
"204987124-0-40126";"You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?"
"204987124-0-40127";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-40128";"You have to give him a chance. He's your son."
"204987124-0-40133";"It's the right thing to do."
"204987124-0-40135";"It's the right thing to do."
"204987124-0-40136";"How can you be sure about this?"
"204987124-0-40137";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-40138";"Why haven't the Daedra taken the Elder Scroll yet?"
"204987124-0-40139";"That doesn't make any sense."
"204987124-0-40140";"What just happened?"
"204987124-0-40141";"What was the Scroll doing here?"
"204987124-0-40142";"That doesn't trouble you?"
"204987124-0-40143";"You don't sound worried."
"204987124-0-40144";"You were a Battlemage?"
"204987124-0-40145";"Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-40146";"Aren't you worried the Scroll is gone?"
"204987124-0-40147";"What?"
"204987124-0-40148";"Why? You believed everything else."
"204987124-0-40150";"People have their reasons for siding with the Daedra."
"204987124-0-40156";"Are you threatening me?"
"204987124-0-40159";"I thought you were blind."
"204987124-0-40160";"How can the writing be different?"
"204987124-0-40161";"How do you know that wasn't the real Clivia Tharn?"
"204987124-0-40162";"What did it say?"
"204987124-0-40163";"You don't sound overly concerned about her well-being."
"204987124-0-40164";"What did the Scroll say about Clivia Tharn?"
"204987124-0-40165";"I see."
"204987124-0-40166";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-40169";"What were you meeting here for?"
"204987124-0-40171";"I'll find her. Follow when it's safe."
"204987124-0-40172";"Very well."
"204987124-0-40185";"Is the Market still intact?"
"204987124-0-40186";"Why is the Arboretum important?"
"204987124-0-40187";"Is the Market still intact?"
"204987124-0-40188";"Why is the Arboretum important?"
"204987124-0-40189";"Daedra, huh?"
"204987124-0-40190";"Can I ask you about something else?"
"204987124-0-40191";"Tell me about Legion Zero."
"204987124-0-40192";"Tell me about Legion Zero."
"204987124-0-40193";"Can I ask you about something else?"
"204987124-0-40196";"How have the Imperials fared against the Daedra?"
"204987124-0-40198";"What was Mannimarco doing?"
"204987124-0-40199";"How did the city come under attack?"
"204987124-0-40204";"Do you know what happened to the Empress-Regent?"
"204987124-0-40205";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-40206";"We're trying to capture those districts as well?"
"204987124-0-40208";"Where are all the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-40209";"I should take the notes to Captain Pudazi."
"204987124-0-40211";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-40224";"""Moderate losses?"""
"204987124-0-40225";"Who's injured?"
"204987124-0-40226";"There are quite a few Worm Cultists out there."
"204987124-0-40227";"So you can still fight?"
"204987124-0-40228";"Any idea why they've focused on the Market?"
"204987124-0-40229";"So you still haven't evacuated?"
"204987124-0-40230";"What do you mean they can't be broken?"
"204987124-0-40231";"You mean I have to go to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-40232";"What do I have to do?"
"204987124-0-40234";"The pledge is how you determine that?"
"204987124-0-40236";"I'll speak to him, then."
"204987124-0-40237";"What's wrong with you?"
"204987124-0-40239";"And your children have the same illness?"
"204987124-0-40248";"I thought you said everyone was dead."
"204987124-0-40249";"Is there anything else you need then?"
"204987124-0-40250";"Do you know what they're planning to summon?"
"204987124-0-40252";"Is there any way to stop them?"
"204987124-0-40253";"All right. That makes sense."
"204987124-0-40254";"Is there anything else you need?"
"204987124-0-40257";"All right. I will look for Vorias."
"204987124-0-40258";"Tell me. I'll help them if I can."
"204987124-0-40259";"I will do what I can."
"204987124-0-40260";"Just drink the potion."
"204987124-0-40261";"Here you go then. Drink up."
"204987124-0-40262";"Sure. What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-40264";"All right. I can do that."
"204987124-0-40265";"Sure. Just drink the potion."
"204987124-0-40267";"Can you be more specific?"
"204987124-0-40268";"She was a traitor then?"
"204987124-0-40269";"How did they take the district?"
"204987124-0-40270";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-40271";"What else can you tell me about the dark legionaries?"
"204987124-0-40272";"But you survived."
"204987124-0-40273";"Who leads it?"
"204987124-0-40274";"Is that how you were wounded?"
"204987124-0-40276";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-40277";"Any words of advice?"
"204987124-0-40278";"I can handle that."
"204987124-0-40279";"All right. I'll send the signal when it's done."
"204987124-0-40282";"Then how do I capture the district for the Covenant?"
"204987124-0-40284";"All right. Wish me luck, then."
"204987124-0-40285";"Why are you so angry at the Covenant?"
"204987124-0-40290";"Necrologist?"
"204987124-0-40291";"That's a very specific role."
"204987124-0-40292";"So why can't you just take the samples from here?"
"204987124-0-40293";"Of course. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-40294";"Wait. Your grandfather is still alive?"
"204987124-0-40295";"How bad is it?"
"204987124-0-40296";"All right. I'll kill this Scarhea."
"204987124-0-40298";"Right. So you're with the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-40299";"Can you hazard a guess?"
"204987124-0-40305";"Possibly. Where are they?"
"204987124-0-40308";"All right. I'll look for Jagar."
"204987124-0-40309";"All right, I'll talk to Priestess Simplicia."
"204987124-0-40310";"So there are other Imperial soldiers out here?"
"204987124-0-40311";"Have you tried to find any other soldiers?"
"204987124-0-40312";"What's so special about the bureaucrats?"
"204987124-0-40313";"How long do you think you can keep this up?"
"204987124-0-40314";"Can we get back to the business at hand?"
"204987124-0-40315";"Is there more to it?"
"204987124-0-40317";"Fair enough. I'll blow the horn when it's captured."
"204987124-0-40318";"I'm ready. Let's go."
"204987124-0-40321";"So you want the crown for his heir?"
"204987124-0-40323";"You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?"
"204987124-0-40324";"You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?"
"204987124-0-40328";"But that's what you're trying to do right now."
"204987124-0-40329";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40330";"You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?"
"204987124-0-40332";"I'd like to go down there."
"204987124-0-40333";"But that's what you're trying to do right now."
"204987124-0-40334";"You plan to retake the Tower? Why not call for reinforcements?"
"204987124-0-40339";"What makes you think she's unpleasant?"
"204987124-0-40340";"Can you remind me how to destroy the anchor?"
"204987124-0-40343";"Who is Idryne Sadrys?"
"204987124-0-40344";"Then how do I get in?"
"204987124-0-40345";"What's in the crypts?"
"204987124-0-40346";"Why do you think they're conducting this ritual in the temple?"
"204987124-0-40347";"So it's just revenge then?"
"204987124-0-40348";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-40349";"I found the mage you spoke of. Am I worthy of a reward?"
"204987124-0-40350";"What do you mean, the situation in Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-40351";"You're criminals?"
"204987124-0-40352";"So how do I join your organization?"
"204987124-0-40354";"Sounds good. Sign me up!"
"204987124-0-40355";"Tell me more about your organization."
"204987124-0-40356";"Opportunity?"
"204987124-0-40357";"What happens if I receive a bounty?"
"204987124-0-40358";"Flee? Is there anywhere I can run to?"
"204987124-0-40359";"Where's the nearest Outlaws Refuge?"
"204987124-0-40360";"So how do I join your organization?"
"204987124-0-40361";"What happens if I commit a crime?"
"204987124-0-40362";"Isn't there anything I can do about the bounty?"
"204987124-0-40363";"I know the Guard, but who are the Enforcers?"
"204987124-0-40364";"Tell me more about the Outlaw's Refuge."
"204987124-0-40365";"Why do I need a Fence?"
"204987124-0-40366";"What do you mean, move stolen goods?"
"204987124-0-40367";"What do you mean, launder stolen goods?"
"204987124-0-40368";"Why should I pay a Fence when I can just go to the Guard to clear my bounty?"
"204987124-0-40369";"What do you mean, launder stolen goods?"
"204987124-0-40370";"So you're bounty hunters?"
"204987124-0-40371";"How does someone become an Enforcer?"
"204987124-0-40372";"Yes, I'd like to become an Enforcer."
"204987124-0-40373";"So they're just like the Guard?"
"204987124-0-40374";"What is Enforcers garb?"
"204987124-0-40375";"What is Enforcers garb?"
"204987124-0-40376";"How do I know if someone is really an Enforcer?"
"204987124-0-40377";"How do I know if someone is really an Enforcer?"
"204987124-0-40378";"Can an Enforcer attack me at any time?"
"204987124-0-40379";"Fair enough. What did you do before all this?"
"204987124-0-40380";"Care to enlighten me?"
"204987124-0-40384";"How do I know who's an outlaw?"
"204987124-0-40387";"What are the Enforcers?"
"204987124-0-40389";"What can you tell me about bandit dens?"
"204987124-0-40392";"Where do I take confiscated goods?"
"204987124-0-40393";"How do you do that?"
"204987124-0-40394";"Fighting bandits, really?"
"204987124-0-40396";"Any tips for fighting bandits?"
"204987124-0-40398";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-40400";"I'm so sorry."
"204987124-0-40402";"So am I worthy of a reward?"
"204987124-0-40405";"I do."
"204987124-0-40410";"I won't say a word."
"204987124-0-40414";"There are a lot of Daedra out there."
"204987124-0-40416";"You're not an Imperial."
"204987124-0-40417";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40419";"How did that work out?"
"204987124-0-40421";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40424";"But your fellow legionaries?"
"204987124-0-40425";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-40426";"No, I mean what sorcery has made you look like this?"
"204987124-0-40427";"Why betray the Legion?"
"204987124-0-40428";"Have you been mind controlled?"
"204987124-0-40429";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-40434";"Who will catch me?"
"204987124-0-40435";"So the other Alliances are here?"
"204987124-0-40437";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-40439";"Why didn't you do anything to stop him?"
"204987124-0-40440";"No thanks."
"204987124-0-40445";"So he's somewhere in the sewers?"
"204987124-0-40447";"There's no other way?"
"204987124-0-40449";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-40450";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-40453";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-40457";"How can a madman possibly help us?"
"204987124-0-40468";"I have so many questions."
"204987124-0-40469";"How can we destroy it?"
"204987124-0-40470";"What are these Sentinels?"
"204987124-0-40476";"Tell me more about your travels."
"204987124-0-40477";"You're a follower of Trinimac?"
"204987124-0-40478";"Actually, I was asked to check on you and make sure you were all right."
"204987124-0-40479";"Do you have a plan to send the draugr back to their rest?"
"204987124-0-40481";"Why can't you finish building Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-40483";"What do you think it means?"
"204987124-0-40485";"Maybe that shows them making the journey to this land?"
"204987124-0-40487";"Building something? Maybe it commemorates the construction of this barrow."
"204987124-0-40489";"You have no idea, do you?"
"204987124-0-40492";"So eating Woolly's cheese doesn't make Orc maidens go wild?"
"204987124-0-40494";"What's so special about this ale?"
"204987124-0-40496";"Have you been in barrows like this before?"
"204987124-0-40497";"I thought we were looking for a way to return the draugr to their rest."
"204987124-0-40498";"Nothing like that. I need a love poem to impress an Orc maiden."
"204987124-0-40500";"So how do we fix this?"
"204987124-0-40502";"Ambassador Rigurt mentioned how good he thought you smelled …."
"204987124-0-40504";"He might have also accidentally fallen into a sarcophagus."
"204987124-0-40505";"At least he dealt with your draugr problem."
"204987124-0-40506";"I can't believe you're going to profit from this when it was all your fault."
"204987124-0-40509";"You got the Dragon mask. These poor villagers deserve some gold for the trouble you caused them."
"204987124-0-40510";"What happened the last time you tried to reach the summit?"
"204987124-0-40511";"You really think the Armlet of Torug is at the summit?"
"204987124-0-40512";"I agree with you. The Armlet of Torug should go to the museum."
"204987124-0-40513";"The Armlet of Torug?"
"204987124-0-40514";"Tell me what you want to do with the relic."
"204987124-0-40515";"They seemed happy, except for Lum. For some reason, the mead was full of bees."
"204987124-0-40517";"What do you hope to find up there?"
"204987124-0-40518";"I'll go present myself to Kharsthun."
"204987124-0-40519";"So how can I help?"
"204987124-0-40520";"Isn't the summit dangerous?"
"204987124-0-40521";"Isn't the summit dangerous?"
"204987124-0-40523";"What if Kharsthun's translation is wrong?"
"204987124-0-40525";"What kind of food do Orcs consider amorous?"
"204987124-0-40526";"I have questions about the other items."
"204987124-0-40527";"You can tell me. What makes Rigurt's mead so rare?"
"204987124-0-40528";"I have questions about the other items."
"204987124-0-40530";"Who's Gloorot?"
"204987124-0-40531";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-40532";"He's a treasure hunter?"
"204987124-0-40533";"And he arrived after the draugr began harassing the village?"
"204987124-0-40534";"And you're sure the draugr emerged from the barrow?"
"204987124-0-40535";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-40536";"Tell me about this village."
"204987124-0-40538";"I have questions about the other items."
"204987124-0-40539";"Would you trade this block of curdled mammoth cheese for a chunk of your echatere's cheese?"
"204987124-0-40540";"Thanks for the cheese."
"204987124-0-40547";"What are you going to do with the relics now?"
"204987124-0-40548";"I agree with you. The Armlet of Torug should remain at the shrine."
"204987124-0-40553";"That sounds dangerous."
"204987124-0-40555";"Rigurt needs an Orcish perfume to help him impress an Orc woman …."
"204987124-0-40556";"A powerful foe? Any suggestions?"
"204987124-0-40558";"I really need an Orcish love poem. Any ideas?"
"204987124-0-40559";"If you think that will work."
"204987124-0-40560";"Thanks for the love poem."
"204987124-0-40561";"Does the ale really have an amorous affect on Orcs?"
"204987124-0-40562";"What's so special about this ale?"
"204987124-0-40563";"Thanks for the ale."
"204987124-0-40569";"Tell me more about the storm."
"204987124-0-40570";"When was the last time you saw your wife?"
"204987124-0-40571";"You think it's too late to complete Lady Sovelle's mission?"
"204987124-0-40572";"You think it's too late to complete Lady Sovelle's mission?"
"204987124-0-40573";"How did your ships end up so far off course?"
"204987124-0-40574";"How did your ships end up so far off course?"
"204987124-0-40575";"Why haven't you sent your crew to search for Lady Sovelle or other survivors?"
"204987124-0-40576";"Why haven't you sent your crew to search for Lady Sovelle or other survivors?"
"204987124-0-40582";"Why are these chieftains here?"
"204987124-0-40583";"These chiefs don't agree with King Kurog?"
"204987124-0-40584";"And King Kurog wants to change that?"
"204987124-0-40587";"I understand."
"204987124-0-40588";"What happened to you after Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-40597";"I met the adventurers you hired to find Khoruzoth."
"204987124-0-40599";"Your son is dead."
"204987124-0-40600";"I thought Thukhozod was immortal."
"204987124-0-40601";"Why do you think Khoruzoth was safe in Thukhozod's Sanctum?"
"204987124-0-40602";"Here's Khoruzoth's amulet. You should have it to remember him by."
"204987124-0-40611";"I'm only saying that it's a good thing you happened by when you did."
"204987124-0-40612";"I met your apprentice, Berrice."
"204987124-0-40613";"How do you recommend I approach the fortress?"
"204987124-0-40614";"An opportunity that involves durzogs?"
"204987124-0-40616";"And yours involves durzogs?"
"204987124-0-40617";"Tell me more about the briarhearts."
"204987124-0-40618";"But what are the briarhearts?"
"204987124-0-40619";"But what are the briarhearts?"
"204987124-0-40620";"And you can put an end to the process?"
"204987124-0-40622";"And you can put an end to the process?"
"204987124-0-40627";"She's worried about your attempt to embarrass the king."
"204987124-0-40628";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-40629";"Aren't you supposed to mark the harpy nests with a fire arrow?"
"204987124-0-40630";"I'll clear a path to the towers. Just follow the Orcs. And keep your eyes open."
"204987124-0-40633";"Just stay safe and keep your arrows ready."
"204987124-0-40634";"Are you saying he's not all he's cracked up to be?"
"204987124-0-40635";"Sorry I asked."
"204987124-0-40636";"But what's a Dark Elf explorer doing in Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-40637";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-40638";"How did you find this barrow?"
"204987124-0-40639";"Actually, I don't think she's your apprentice any longer."
"204987124-0-40640";"What made you decide to help the Orcs with their draugr problem?"
"204987124-0-40641";"Do you think Narsis did something to agitate the draugr?"
"204987124-0-40642";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-40643";"Constructs went on a rampage, but Neramo was able to get them under control."
"204987124-0-40644";"Wait, he just wants to …."
"204987124-0-40651";"What was supposed to happen?"
"204987124-0-40652";"What was supposed to happen?"
"204987124-0-40653";"What are you planning to do with those things?"
"204987124-0-40655";"Whatever happened to Clanker?"
"204987124-0-40656";"I'm not sure. Skordo is with him."
"204987124-0-40658";"I'll untie you."
"204987124-0-40659";"What's your mission exactly?"
"204987124-0-40660";"How can those monsters be natural?"
"204987124-0-40661";"Are we ready then?"
"204987124-0-40662";"I'll save Lady Sovelle."
"204987124-0-40663";"So what does that mean, exactly?"
"204987124-0-40665";"I'll tell Lady Sovelle what you did."
"204987124-0-40666";"Why don't we just find and destroy this central tree?"
"204987124-0-40668";"Eveli will stay behind and keep you safe."
"204987124-0-40669";"So what do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-40670";"Just make sure Alinon doesn't get hurt, all right?"
"204987124-0-40674";"All right, I'll look for Norgim the great bear."
"204987124-0-40677";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-40684";"Not exactly."
"204987124-0-40687";"You want me to talk to the clan chiefs?"
"204987124-0-40688";"So what do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-40689";"What kinds of problems are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-40696";"You believe the attack on the temple is a trap?"
"204987124-0-40697";"Very well, I'll do as you ask."
"204987124-0-40698";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-40699";"At least tell me what you know about the situation."
"204987124-0-40701";"Any other way inside besides the locked door?"
"204987124-0-40708";"Who's Investigator Vale?"
"204987124-0-40710";"You can't just shoot someone because you think they might be evil!"
"204987124-0-40711";"Forge-Mother Alga will verify my story."
"204987124-0-40712";"How can I get inside the temple?"
"204987124-0-40717";"What more can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-40719";"Where can I find Solgra and the others?"
"204987124-0-40724";"I was asking about the fish."
"204987124-0-40725";"How big was that slaughterfish?"
"204987124-0-40726";"That sounds terrible."
"204987124-0-40727";"So why did you marry him?"
"204987124-0-40728";"Really? What happened then?"
"204987124-0-40729";"So, is Chief Gloorot an interesting catch?"
"204987124-0-40730";"A military contingent?"
"204987124-0-40731";"The fanatics claimed to take orders from Chief Bazrag."
"204987124-0-40733";"If Bazrag is behind this, what should we do?"
"204987124-0-40734";"Your husband? Who's that?"
"204987124-0-40735";"Have you seen any fish more interesting than your husband?"
"204987124-0-40736";"How could someone catch that fish?"
"204987124-0-40738";"And what about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-40739";"What about Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-40740";"You think those two are involved with the fanatics?"
"204987124-0-40743";"Tell me about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-40744";"Are you going to examine the shrine?"
"204987124-0-40745";"What were you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-40746";"Any idea why the Riekrs attacked you?"
"204987124-0-40747";"You felt you needed to prove yourselves?"
"204987124-0-40748";"What were you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-40749";"And if I collect the Riekr leader's totem, that will help you?"
"204987124-0-40750";"Where are Avreg and Zhasim?"
"204987124-0-40751";"Why is that strange?"
"204987124-0-40756";"Your brother has a cat?"
"204987124-0-40757";"Murukh is fine. Orgotha asked me to get everyone back to camp and then get the Riekr leader's totem."
"204987124-0-40758";"You tracked the Riekrs to this cave?"
"204987124-0-40759";"Your brother has a cat?"
"204987124-0-40760";"Is your father ill?"
"204987124-0-40761";"Ethian had nothing to do with your kidnapping."
"204987124-0-40762";"Ethian was very worried about you. It's obvious he loved you."
"204987124-0-40768";"Orgotha asked me to find you and the rest of your hunting party."
"204987124-0-40769";"How did you end up living with an Orc clan?"
"204987124-0-40770";"You should return to your camp."
"204987124-0-40771";"In all this time, no Khajiit has offered to take you to your homeland?"
"204987124-0-40773";"Do you remember anything about your real family?"
"204987124-0-40777";"What if I don't close the valve?"
"204987124-0-40778";"Point down"
"204987124-0-40790";"Do you think she made it deeper into the ruins?"
"204987124-0-40796";"Do you remember anything about your real family?"
"204987124-0-40797";"I'll go make the gloves, then."
"204987124-0-40798";"Actually, I already have some refined jute as well. What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-40802";"Actually, I have some iron ingots as well. What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-40804";"I'll go make that dagger, then."
"204987124-0-40807";"I'll go get this sanded, then."
"204987124-0-40808";"I'll go craft that bow, then."
"204987124-0-40810";"I'll go craft that potion, then."
"204987124-0-40812";"I'll go craft that rune, then."
"204987124-0-40813";"Who hired her to lead this expedition?"
"204987124-0-40814";"So what's Lady Laurent's interest in all this?"
"204987124-0-40815";"What's your role in this expedition?"
"204987124-0-40816";"All right. What should I do if I find them?"
"204987124-0-40820";"Who's Kharsthun?"
"204987124-0-40821";"Do you and Lady Laurent get along?"
"204987124-0-40823";"Where did you study this scroll fragment?"
"204987124-0-40824";"Wait. Your clan locked the forge-hammer away."
"204987124-0-40825";"Are you going to lock the hammer away?"
"204987124-0-40828";"Morkul clan's strength came from here. Embrace your past."
"204987124-0-40829";"Why did <<1>> bring him along?"
"204987124-0-40830";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-40831";"It looks like he was wrong."
"204987124-0-40832";"I want to know more about those creatures."
"204987124-0-40834";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40836";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40837";"I still need to deal with the briarhearts."
"204987124-0-40838";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-40839";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-40844";"I killed him."
"204987124-0-40845";"So what does ""zugra"" mean?"
"204987124-0-40847";"[Lie] It was quick. I don't think he suffered."
"204987124-0-40848";"[Lie] It was quick. I don't think he suffered."
"204987124-0-40850";"Where will you go now?"
"204987124-0-40851";"Where will you go now?"
"204987124-0-40853";"Do you need to tell them anything?"
"204987124-0-40855";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-40856";"Will this tell you what happened to the Orcs?"
"204987124-0-40857";"<<1>> said you should return to camp."
"204987124-0-40858";"Did you really need to kill Chief Targak?"
"204987124-0-40860";"Do you need anything else from me?"
"204987124-0-40861";"You think this was left for you to find?"
"204987124-0-40863";"I'm not badly injured, though."
"204987124-0-40864";"What brings a Wood Elf to Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-40865";"They saved your life."
"204987124-0-40867";"I have the blood, but I'm not quite certain what to do with it."
"204987124-0-40868";"Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-40871";"Wait. Tell me more about the Agra Crun."
"204987124-0-40875";"And what about your task?"
"204987124-0-40877";"Where should I take the scroll?"
"204987124-0-40880";"Orsinium's a big place. Where do I find Kroma?"
"204987124-0-40881";"Yes. I need to present myself to Forge-Mother Alga."
"204987124-0-40884";"What about you? Are you going to Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-40887";"I helped a caravan that was attacked by the Winterborn. Supplies for the outlying clans were stolen."
"204987124-0-40888";"I know where they took the supplies."
"204987124-0-40889";"Gulug betrayed the clans. He says the supplies were taken to Frostbreak Fortress."
"204987124-0-40894";"What do you know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-40895";"Tell me about the relics in <<1>>."
"204987124-0-40896";"Why didn't the king choose <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-40897";"You what?"
"204987124-0-40899";"What is Morkuldin?"
"204987124-0-40900";"You're rebuilding the city of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-40902";"Now that you know the truth, will you abandon your Orc clan?"
"204987124-0-40904";"It's good to know where you came from."
"204987124-0-40905";"What's an echatere?"
"204987124-0-40906";"You're rebuilding the city of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-40907";"And who's Forge-Mother Alga?"
"204987124-0-40910";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-40911";"Was the chief part of your caravan?"
"204987124-0-40912";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-40913";"You want me to help the chiefs?"
"204987124-0-40914";"I'll deliver the message and help the clan chiefs."
"204987124-0-40915";"Do I need to say anything specific?"
"204987124-0-40922";"If I solve your problem in the quarry, will you agree to attend the moot?"
"204987124-0-40924";"If I assist your forge-wife with her problem, will you agree to attend the moot?"
"204987124-0-40926";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-40928";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-40929";"Chief Bazrag's not attending the moot?"
"204987124-0-40931";"You don't seem very concerned about Chief Bazrag."
"204987124-0-40934";"You mentioned trouble with extremists."
"204987124-0-40943";"How'd you get involved with High Priestess Solgra?"
"204987124-0-40947";"Tell me what the problem is, High Priestess Solgra."
"204987124-0-40949";"You'll be branded as bad as the Vosh Rakh."
"204987124-0-40950";"Trinimac? Isn't that who you worship here?"
"204987124-0-40952";"I'll find Zubesha. You need to return to your camp."
"204987124-0-40955";"Did you learn anything about what's going on here?"
"204987124-0-40956";"Any other ideas about how we locate this prison?"
"204987124-0-40957";"What did you hear?"
"204987124-0-40958";"There's a well that leads to the prison. We just need a way to climb down."
"204987124-0-40960";"I'll find a rope and be right back."
"204987124-0-40966";"High Priestess Solgra sent me, not Kurog."
"204987124-0-40967";"The fanatics kept shouting your name as they attacked."
"204987124-0-40968";"Why should I rescue you after what you did at the Orsinium temple?"
"204987124-0-40970";"But what's the point of all this?"
"204987124-0-40971";"There's no way I can save both of you?"
"204987124-0-40972";"How do I set you free?"
"204987124-0-40973";"Can't I rescue both of you?"
"204987124-0-40974";"So I should save you instead of Unsulag?"
"204987124-0-40976";"So I should save you instead of Gahar?"
"204987124-0-40977";"It never is. What else is going to happen?"
"204987124-0-40978";"An engineer gave an elixir to drink. Said it would help with the poison."
"204987124-0-40983";"The Drake of—?"
"204987124-0-40986";"What are you doing down here in the sewer?"
"204987124-0-40994";"I'll go to Fharun Stronghold and meet Eveli."
"204987124-0-40995";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-40997";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-40998";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-40999";"How do I use the lightning prod?"
"204987124-0-41003";"But why ""Blades?"""
"204987124-0-41004";"Are you feeling all right?"
"204987124-0-41009";"Why is <<1>> so important to you?"
"204987124-0-41010";"How did <<1>> betray him?"
"204987124-0-41011";"Do you believe that really happened?"
"204987124-0-41012";"What's unclear?"
"204987124-0-41013";"<<1>>'s final opponent was <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-41014";"Your sister called it a lightning prod."
"204987124-0-41015";"Repair it? Kireth said we need to disable the Dwarven sphere."
"204987124-0-41016";"Theoretically?"
"204987124-0-41017";"What do you mean, ""bad?"""
"204987124-0-41018";"So you want me to find the sphere and use the rod to drain the excess energy?"
"204987124-0-41019";"What are you going to do while I'm tracking the sphere?"
"204987124-0-41020";"What did you mean that attacking the sphere would be ""bad?"""
"204987124-0-41021";"All right. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-41022";"What do you mean by ""overzealous?"""
"204987124-0-41023";"All right, I'll look for a monument stone."
"204987124-0-41024";"Where would I find these burial urns?"
"204987124-0-41025";"Your arm …?"
"204987124-0-41026";"She didn't want the Vosh Rakh to kill you in Trinimac's name."
"204987124-0-41027";"Isn't he trying to unite your people? You could help him."
"204987124-0-41028";"Is that why you attacked the temple?"
"204987124-0-41029";"You escort Chief Bazrag to High Priestess Solgra and I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-41031";"The chief suggested I talk to someone. I'll do that and you'll keep him out of Kurog's hands."
"204987124-0-41032";"I'll see what I can find out."
"204987124-0-41034";"Then that's settled."
"204987124-0-41035";"""Yes sir!"""
"204987124-0-41036";"You can't be serious."
"204987124-0-41037";"What do you know of <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-41038";"Unless he's your final opponent."
"204987124-0-41039";"How can you face Baloth if he does not fight with honor?"
"204987124-0-41050";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-41052";"Most of the Orcs are unconscious and their camp is on fire."
"204987124-0-41053";"The sphere was trying to help?"
"204987124-0-41055";"How is any of this good news?"
"204987124-0-41056";"The sphere ran off after I used the prod."
"204987124-0-41058";"What are you going to do while I chase after the sphere?"
"204987124-0-41059";"What kind of evidence do you need?"
"204987124-0-41060";"I'll find the others. We'll meet up at the back of the ruins."
"204987124-0-41065";"I found this sword at the giant camp."
"204987124-0-41074";"I heard you had a disagreement with the other cultists. Want to tell me about it?"
"204987124-0-41075";"Tell me how to find the prison."
"204987124-0-41076";"Get out of here. But you better not raise the alarm."
"204987124-0-41077";"Jump into? Where is this prison?"
"204987124-0-41080";"All right. Follow me after I see what's waiting for us at the top of the stairs."
"204987124-0-41082";"Good idea. Let's go."
"204987124-0-41086";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-41090";"What will happen to the tomb?"
"204987124-0-41091";"You built this prison?"
"204987124-0-41092";"I'm trying to get people out of here. Can you help me?"
"204987124-0-41093";"Why would the Vosh Rakh imprison you?"
"204987124-0-41094";"<Drink the potion.>"
"204987124-0-41095";"Is there any way around the spike room?"
"204987124-0-41098";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-41103";"I don't think Raynor agrees with you on this one."
"204987124-0-41104";"I should discuss this with Raynor before I make a decision."
"204987124-0-41107";"I should discuss this with Raynor before I make a decision."
"204987124-0-41108";"I don't think Kireth agrees with you on this one."
"204987124-0-41110";"If we were to fix the sphere, how would we go about it?"
"204987124-0-41112";"All right. Let's repair the Dwarven sphere."
"204987124-0-41113";"Why do you like skeletons?"
"204987124-0-41114";"Why do we need a key to the chapel?"
"204987124-0-41116";"Tell me more about this Proselytizer."
"204987124-0-41119";"Go to the back of the ruins. We'll meet there after the Proselytizer is dealt with."
"204987124-0-41121";"What are you getting at?"
"204987124-0-41122";"You think that Eveli Sharp-Arrow is a traitor?"
"204987124-0-41123";"Has someone turned against you?"
"204987124-0-41128";"I understand. Orcs don't smell, or so I've heard."
"204987124-0-41133";"Yes, it sounds delicious."
"204987124-0-41135";"All right, I'll try it."
"204987124-0-41136";"It's very refreshing."
"204987124-0-41139";"I found the stolen goods. I can prove your innocence."
"204987124-0-41146";"I don't understand. You said Bazrag was behind the attack on the temple."
"204987124-0-41147";"What are the Vosh Rakh planning to do next?"
"204987124-0-41148";"And what does that prove?"
"204987124-0-41150";"Interesting. It has a very memorable taste."
"204987124-0-41152";"You defended yourself and your charge."
"204987124-0-41153";"Come to Paragon's Remembrance. I need someone I can trust with us."
"204987124-0-41154";"You have to do what's right for you, but I could certainly use your help."
"204987124-0-41167";"<<1>> is innocent. <<2>> stole this mug."
"204987124-0-41168";"Release <<1>>. You have the mug and she didn't commit the crime."
"204987124-0-41169";"I gave you the mug. You should release <<1>>."
"204987124-0-41170";"I gave you the mug. Now I'd like a reward."
"204987124-0-41171";"Is that significant?"
"204987124-0-41180";"I can't wait to try it."
"204987124-0-41182";"Delicious. Thank you for sharing."
"204987124-0-41183";"Fine. Maybe one bite."
"204987124-0-41184";"That's surprisingly good."
"204987124-0-41185";"She also admitted to chanting outside the village."
"204987124-0-41197";"I'm chief of Shatul. Pay the price or leave the clan."
"204987124-0-41198";"Get moving, before I change my mind."
"204987124-0-41199";"My reasons are my own. This should be enough."
"204987124-0-41201";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-41205";"Can I try some of your ale?"
"204987124-0-41207";"I want you to go with Eveli to High Priestess Solgra."
"204987124-0-41209";"Sure, why not?"
"204987124-0-41211";"I suppose I could try a bite."
"204987124-0-41212";"It's sweet, but not too sweet."
"204987124-0-41213";"Thank you for sharing this."
"204987124-0-41216";"I just like hitting things. In Trinimac's name, of course."
"204987124-0-41217";"A different mask?"
"204987124-0-41221";"I choose Avalian's speed."
"204987124-0-41226";"I can kill other Vosh Rakh?"
"204987124-0-41227";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-41228";"""It?"""
"204987124-0-41230";"And then what happened?"
"204987124-0-41231";"My mistake. I'll go somewhere else."
"204987124-0-41232";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-41235";"Sure! I've eaten stranger stuff than a smoked bear's head."
"204987124-0-41237";"That's a deeply flavored stew."
"204987124-0-41238";"Coffee-infused bear's head stew sounds delightful."
"204987124-0-41239";"All right. Just one."
"204987124-0-41240";"Tell me about Shalda and the others."
"204987124-0-41241";"Tell me about Glothun the Recruiter."
"204987124-0-41242";"Wait here. I'll search the ruins and see what's going on."
"204987124-0-41243";"A banner woven with blood?"
"204987124-0-41244";"A banner woven with blood?"
"204987124-0-41245";"What will you do with the banner if I find it?"
"204987124-0-41247";"Did this Wood Elf say anything else?"
"204987124-0-41249";"Anything that could help would be appreciated."
"204987124-0-41251";"There must be something else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-41252";"I was told that the poem isn't important. What matters is the beginning of every thought."
"204987124-0-41254";"Then tell me what it says."
"204987124-0-41255";"And that someone is me?"
"204987124-0-41259";"Will you try to recover the Argent Mine?"
"204987124-0-41261";"What will you do with the banner if I find it?"
"204987124-0-41262";"Why do you need training arenas?"
"204987124-0-41263";"Can my victory in an arena help you recall the baron who created it?"
"204987124-0-41264";"Who are these Barons Who Move Like … what is it?"
"204987124-0-41265";"So where are these barons of yours now?"
"204987124-0-41266";"Is it working? When I win, can you envision your barons?"
"204987124-0-41267";"What will happen if I beat all your arenas?"
"204987124-0-41268";"What more can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-41269";"Are these barons of yours gone for good?"
"204987124-0-41270";"Who will command this army you plan to train?"
"204987124-0-41271";"Agents in the city?"
"204987124-0-41272";"What can you tell me about this trial?"
"204987124-0-41273";"What do you want?"
"204987124-0-41276";"Does King Kurog know about this?"
"204987124-0-41277";"You're going to blame this on High Priestess Solgra?"
"204987124-0-41278";"Won't the Orcs turn against you."
"204987124-0-41279";"Do you want me to attend the moot?"
"204987124-0-41281";"I was forced to take his life to get the information we needed."
"204987124-0-41282";"That information will save a lot of lives, including the chiefs at the moot."
"204987124-0-41283";"I did what was necessary. Now you have to warn Bazrag and Solgra. They're in danger."
"204987124-0-41290";"Tell me about Shalda and the others."
"204987124-0-41296";"How did you get a job like this?"
"204987124-0-41297";"What did the Guard accuse you of stealing?"
"204987124-0-41298";"Is that significant?"
"204987124-0-41299";"How did you get a job like this?"
"204987124-0-41301";"The king wants a museum?"
"204987124-0-41302";"Is there something I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-41303";"How did you get a job like this?"
"204987124-0-41304";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-41311";"That was it?"
"204987124-0-41313";"That's great. So what has The Rat heard these Daedra say?"
"204987124-0-41314";"But the Dragonfires have already been extinguished."
"204987124-0-41315";"How could Molag Bal ""erase"" the Dragonfires?"
"204987124-0-41317";"Fine. I'll speak to the Drake of Blades in the Imperial sewers."
"204987124-0-41318";"Alga leads the Vosh Rakh, but they're going to blame Solgra for everything that's happening."
"204987124-0-41319";"What do you think we should do now?"
"204987124-0-41320";"Where is High Priestess Solgra?"
"204987124-0-41321";"He seemed very certain."
"204987124-0-41323";"How would you suggest we do that?"
"204987124-0-41324";"Why do you need to kill the chiefs when they're willing to listen?"
"204987124-0-41326";"You won't get away with this."
"204987124-0-41331";"We're leaving?"
"204987124-0-41333";"But something must have inspired the king's bad mood."
"204987124-0-41342";"Any ideas on how I can get past the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-41344";"You must know something about her."
"204987124-0-41345";"What about the ambassador's bodyguard?"
"204987124-0-41348";"Very funny, Skordo. It's good to see you, too."
"204987124-0-41350";"What about the captain and the ambassador?"
"204987124-0-41353";"Where are Eveli and Chief Bazrag?"
"204987124-0-41354";"Hang on, Owayine."
"204987124-0-41356";"But I need to warn Kurog about the Vosh Rakh."
"204987124-0-41358";"You're behind this? When Kurog hears about this—"
"204987124-0-41359";"I can't just leave, not while there are still things that need to be done."
"204987124-0-41360";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-41361";"I'm not leaving without Chief Bazrag and Eveli."
"204987124-0-41362";"There must be another way."
"204987124-0-41364";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-41367";"Where are Kurog and the chiefs?"
"204987124-0-41368";"Before I go, can I ask you something?"
"204987124-0-41369";"Kurog's in on the plan. Where are they holding the moot?"
"204987124-0-41371";"The book is about Boethiah betraying Trinimac."
"204987124-0-41372";"Can you explain this book I found in your tent?"
"204987124-0-41373";"He's using the moot as a trap. He's going to eliminate the chiefs who oppose him."
"204987124-0-41375";"Additional help?"
"204987124-0-41376";"What's actually inside the tomb?"
"204987124-0-41378";"Praise Trinimac, true god of the Orcs!"
"204987124-0-41379";"The Drake of Blades told me that you might know something about Molag Bal's plans."
"204987124-0-41384";"What about the singing <<1>> heard the night before <<2>>'s injury?"
"204987124-0-41385";"Any ideas?"
"204987124-0-41388";"Just be careful. The soldiers and guards are still looking for both of you."
"204987124-0-41389";"I'll try to make this quick then."
"204987124-0-41402";"Why would <<1>> use your hunting blade?"
"204987124-0-41403";"I found your evidence. What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-41405";"It's clear you both loved <<1>>. If Shatul must survive, you should support her—not accuse her."
"204987124-0-41417";"Hail Trinimac, whose sword and shield protects us! Grant me Trinimac's true blessing!"
"204987124-0-41418";"Hail Trinimac, whose sword and shield protects us! Grant me Trinimac's true blessing!"
"204987124-0-41425";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-41427";"Someone needs to stop the king."
"204987124-0-41431";"I guess that's the end of the contract."
"204987124-0-41432";"A ghostly voice said to seek the Dragonfire Cathedral and ""quench the light."""
"204987124-0-41433";"Khoruzoth was wearing this amulet."
"204987124-0-41434";"I might be willing to part with the amulet."
"204987124-0-41435";"I'll consider your offer."
"204987124-0-41437";"I accept. You can have the amulet."
"204987124-0-41440";"Tell me where I can find the high priestess."
"204987124-0-41442";"The high priestess didn't say anything?"
"204987124-0-41443";"They're going to blame you. Claim you're behind the Vosh Rakh."
"204987124-0-41444";"The paths to the moot have been sealed. All except the path through the temple."
"204987124-0-41450";"You must have some idea about where we should look."
"204987124-0-41451";"What do you know about the Dragonfire Cathedral?"
"204987124-0-41452";"Why would Molag Bal want to find it?"
"204987124-0-41453";"So how do we stop him?"
"204987124-0-41454";"All right. I'll find the Kindlepitch and meet you at the crematorium."
"204987124-0-41455";"So we go to the crematorium and …."
"204987124-0-41456";"Ethian and I will meet up with Skordo."
"204987124-0-41473";"Before I go, I want to ask you something."
"204987124-0-41474";"What must I do to retrieve <<Cz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-41479";"How'd your fleet end up so far off course?"
"204987124-0-41480";"Who's Coris the mage?"

"204987124-0-41490";"What would I need to do?"
"204987124-0-41491";"What would I need to do?"
"204987124-0-41494";"There's another option. I could become chief of Shatul."
"204987124-0-41495";"Could the captain or one of the crew have had a hand in her disappearance?"
"204987124-0-41500";"All right. I'll let her know."

"204987124-0-41640";"I should take the Armlet of Torug."
"204987124-0-41642";"Why is it important?"
"204987124-0-41643";"Why not? What do they want with it?"
"204987124-0-41644";"Do the Winterborn have equal claim to the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-41645";"Can you tell me more about the relic itself?"
"204987124-0-41646";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-41648";"I don't understand. Why would you betray your own tribe?"
"204987124-0-41649";"All right. Where should I look?"
"204987124-0-41650";"Just tell me where I need to look."
"204987124-0-41651";"Here, take it."
"204987124-0-41653";"<Place the <<1>> upon the shrine.>"
"204987124-0-41659";"Why should I help you?"
"204987124-0-41660";"Looking for something? Can you be more specific?"
"204987124-0-41662";"Where would we even start?"
"204987124-0-41663";"Nerves?"
"204987124-0-41664";"Why do you call yourself the ""Drake of Blades?"""
"204987124-0-41665";"Must be difficult."
"204987124-0-41666";"Do you have any stake in the War of the Three Banners?"
"204987124-0-41669";"So you don't care who claims the city?"
"204987124-0-41670";"So you're waiting for the next Dragonborn Emperor?"
"204987124-0-41671";"So why do you call yourself the Drake of Blades?"
"204987124-0-41672";"And Lady Laurent disagrees?"
"204987124-0-41674";"If you insist."
"204987124-0-41685";"Open the portal."
"204987124-0-41686";"Open the portal."
"204987124-0-41687";"Open the portal."
"204987124-0-41689";"Open the portal."
"204987124-0-41690";"Vale of the Surreal"
"204987124-0-41691";"The Theater of Despair"
"204987124-0-41692";"Yes. She sent me out to look for you."
"204987124-0-41693";"What did you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-41694";"Yes?"
"204987124-0-41695";"So you want me to make a fake key?"
"204987124-0-41697";"What do you want?"
"204987124-0-41698";"What do you want?"
"204987124-0-41699";"How do I open this gate?"
"204987124-0-41700";"All right. How do I open the gate?"
"204987124-0-41701";"<Place the tall vase.>"
"204987124-0-41704";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-41705";"<Place the tall vase.>"
"204987124-0-41708";"<Place the tall vase.>"
"204987124-0-41711";"Here you go. What's the ""Sublime Brazier?"""
"204987124-0-41712";"Yes, I read it. What do you make of it?"
"204987124-0-41713";"So why were the Daedra holding onto this book?"
"204987124-0-41714";"So why were the Daedra holding onto this book?"
"204987124-0-41716";"So what's the plan?"
"204987124-0-41717";"And after that?"
"204987124-0-41719";"All right, I'll rescue Egnatius and meet you back at the Alliance base."
"204987124-0-41720";"So you do know something about the scroll she was asking about?"
"204987124-0-41721";"Do you think you could read it if you saw it again?"
"204987124-0-41722";"What's written on the scroll?"
"204987124-0-41724";"Why are you so anxious?"
"204987124-0-41725";"Do you follow the Divines?"
"204987124-0-41726";"Why?"
"204987124-0-41727";"But don't the Dragonguard venerate Akatosh?"
"204987124-0-41728";"What can you tell me about Egnatius?"
"204987124-0-41729";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-41730";"What's your partner's name?"
"204987124-0-41731";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-41732";"What's your partner's name?"
"204987124-0-41734";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-41735";"Where did you see your papers last?"
"204987124-0-41736";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-41738";"Praise Malacath, true father of the Orcs!"
"204987124-0-41739";"By Malacath's furious left fang, give me his true blessing, priest!"
"204987124-0-41740";"By Malacath's terrifying tusks, give me his true blessing, priest!"
"204987124-0-41743";"That sounds pretty bleak."
"204987124-0-41745";"So you've only stuck around to help others escape?"
"204987124-0-41749";"Only Xivkyn will charge the fragments?"
"204987124-0-41754";"What did your tribe plan to do with it?"
"204987124-0-41755";"Would the Orcs of Wrothgar want it?"
"204987124-0-41756";"Can it be destroyed?"
"204987124-0-41758";"Who was your ancestor?"
"204987124-0-41759";"If you feel so strongly, can't you search for it yourself?"
"204987124-0-41761";"Actually, one of the Winterborn helped me recover it."
"204987124-0-41764";"This seems like the best place for it. You can have it."
"204987124-0-41767";"Someone needs to stop the king."
"204987124-0-41768";"Someone needs to stop the king."
"204987124-0-41769";"Have you ever thought of leaving them?"
"204987124-0-41770";"So Captain Caudex fought against the traitors?"
"204987124-0-41771";"You said Legion Zero betrayed the city?"
"204987124-0-41773";"Could Malacath recreate the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-41774";"Doesn't look like it went well."
"204987124-0-41775";"About your exposed heart …."
"204987124-0-41777";"Actually, I'm here to help you. One of your soldiers sent me."
"204987124-0-41778";"So you don't want my help?"
"204987124-0-41780";"I'll help defend your garrison doors from Molag Bal's army."
"204987124-0-41781";"Is that all there is to it?"
"204987124-0-41783";"Why are you meeting the ambassador in Morkul instead of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-41784";"Were you a musician before the city fell?"
"204987124-0-41785";"Does it bother you to be immortal?"
"204987124-0-41786";"So you're just going to give up?"
"204987124-0-41787";"Are you disturbed by your immortality?"
"204987124-0-41788";"I'm trying to understand how the city fell to Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-41789";"You sound like you resent what's happened to you."
"204987124-0-41790";"What about taking back the city from Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-41791";"Is now really the time to be digging out old books?"
"204987124-0-41792";"So, you're pleased to be immortal?"
"204987124-0-41793";"So scavenging is how you've held out for two months?"
"204987124-0-41794";"So you're comfortable with becoming immortal?"
"204987124-0-41795";"You have children living in the city?"
"204987124-0-41796";"Could you be more specific?"
"204987124-0-41797";"How do you feel about being immortal?"
"204987124-0-41798";"How have you and Captain Caudex held this barracks?"
"204987124-0-41799";"Are you saying we should have left Kurog in power?"
"204987124-0-41800";"So why does Kurog's death seem to bother you?"
"204987124-0-41802";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-41803";"Is this scroll really that old?"
"204987124-0-41804";"What was this dream about?"
"204987124-0-41805";"So how has an old scroll helped you defend the garrison?"
"204987124-0-41806";"So this scroll made all eight of you immortal?"
"204987124-0-41807";"Me?"
"204987124-0-41808";"So I should take this to the masked woman? The Drake of Blades?"
"204987124-0-41810";"All right. I'll take this scroll to the Drake of Blades."
"204987124-0-41812";"You said each time you come back, you feel less like yourself?"
"204987124-0-41813";"Doesn't losing parts of yourself worry you?"
"204987124-0-41814";"If I take this scroll, won't you lose your immortality?"
"204987124-0-41815";"What did you mean when you said Kurog had won?"
"204987124-0-41816";"I'm still not sure what you mean by that. How did Kurog win?"
"204987124-0-41819";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-41820";"You consider being immortal a curse?"
"204987124-0-41821";"Is that why you're praying to the Eight Divines?"
"204987124-0-41822";"So you'd prefer to die?"
"204987124-0-41823";"So, what are you writing about?"
"204987124-0-41824";"So your focus is the people?"
"204987124-0-41825";"Is this really the time to be playing a flute?"
"204987124-0-41826";"Do you have any thoughts about how it happened?"
"204987124-0-41827";"So what book are you reading?"
"204987124-0-41828";"You don't sound frightened by any of those."
"204987124-0-41829";"Just 'fine'?"
"204987124-0-41830";"Can you tell me anything about how Imperial City fell?"
"204987124-0-41831";"That doesn't really answer my question."
"204987124-0-41832";"What are you cooking?"
"204987124-0-41833";"How do you feel about becoming immortal?"
"204987124-0-41838";"Are you worried that without a king the city might make a tempting target?"
"204987124-0-41839";"Who am I delivering the letters to?"
"204987124-0-41840";"Are you thinking of withdrawing from the alliance?"
"204987124-0-41841";"Very well …."
"204987124-0-41842";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-41844";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-41845";"Why would the Daedra want it?"
"204987124-0-41846";"You mean you don't know what's in it?"
"204987124-0-41848";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-41849";"How will I recognize these friends of yours?"
"204987124-0-41850";"Are you happy with the rebuilt Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-41851";"Chief Bazrag wanted me to give this to you."
"204987124-0-41854";"Chief Bazrag wanted you to have this."
"204987124-0-41857";"Please. At least take a look at the letter."
"204987124-0-41860";"Chief Bazrag asked me to deliver this to you."
"204987124-0-41863";"What are they doing to the temple?"
"204987124-0-41865";"I almost forgot. Chief Bazrag wanted you to have this."
"204987124-0-41866";"What's the situation here in the city?"
"204987124-0-41867";"Before you go, Chief Bazrag wanted me to give you this."
"204987124-0-41870";"Come or not, it's up to you."
"204987124-0-41873";"He wanted me to deliver this letter."
"204987124-0-41875";"How do you know Chief Bazrag?"
"204987124-0-41878";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-41879";"Simple as that?"
"204987124-0-41881";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-41882";"Very well."
"204987124-0-41883";"What does the ritual do?"
"204987124-0-41884";"Which relief do you think showed the first part of the tale?"
"204987124-0-41885";"Which relief showed the second part of the tale?"
"204987124-0-41886";"Which relief do you think showed the first part of the tale?"
"204987124-0-41887";"What kind of deal?"
"204987124-0-41889";"Consider it done."
"204987124-0-41890";"Which relief showed the second part of the tale?"
"204987124-0-41891";"How have you held the garrison all this time?"
"204987124-0-41892";"It sounds like you've come to a decision."
"204987124-0-41894";"There's been too much pain and suffering. Make sure you keep that promise."
"204987124-0-41898";"Prove you aren't one of the Vosh Rakh pretenders and bestow upon me Trinimac's true blessing!"
"204987124-0-41899";"Hail Trinimac, whose sword and shield protect us! Grant me Trinimac's true blessing!"
"204987124-0-41900";"<<1>> sent me to find you."
"204987124-0-41901";"What documents?"
"204987124-0-41902";"I'll find Jaeloreh, retrieve your documents, and meet you on the road to Orsinium."
"204987124-0-41905";"Yes, I have it right here. What's next?"
"204987124-0-41907";"All right. Good luck."
"204987124-0-41912";"What do you think it opens?"
"204987124-0-41914";"Molag Bal's corruption finally took hold. He chose to take his own life rather than lose control."
"204987124-0-41915";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-41916";"What if I don't want to go?"
"204987124-0-41918";"What's next for you and Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-41920";"I wish you well, King Bazrag."
"204987124-0-41921";"Can you tell me more about the lantern you gave me?"
"204987124-0-41923";"I didn't think that you and Kurog ever liked each other."
"204987124-0-41924";"Then how did Kurog become king?"
"204987124-0-41925";"Are you happy with the rebuilt Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-41926";"Do you think that's likely?"
"204987124-0-41927";"I will give you your good death."
"204987124-0-41928";"Chief Bazrag asked me to deliver this letter."
"204987124-0-41929";"Chief Bazrag and I stopped Kurog."
"204987124-0-41931";"I was kind of busy."
"204987124-0-41934";"Chief Bazrag asked me to give you this."
"204987124-0-41939";"Forge a false key, then treat it with acid so it looks old. Got it."
"204987124-0-41940";"I'll meet you there after."
"204987124-0-41942";"Where's the rest of the expedition?"
"204987124-0-41943";"Rest easy, brave Orc."
"204987124-0-41944";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-41945";"I'll try to find the other stanzas."
"204987124-0-41948";"Why haven't you succumbed to it?"
"204987124-0-41950";"Why go on with it?"
"204987124-0-41951";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-41952";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-41954";"I understand. Goodbye, Captain."
"204987124-0-41955";"So you deserted?"
"204987124-0-41958";"But why specifically are you interested in ogre artwork?"
"204987124-0-41960";"Where is the House of Orsimer Glories?"
"204987124-0-41962";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41963";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41964";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41965";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41966";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41967";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41968";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41969";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41970";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41971";"What can you tell me about the next arena?"
"204987124-0-41972";"Fair enough. Get to safety. We'll see about getting you this scroll."
"204987124-0-41973";"All right."
"204987124-0-41974";"I will."
"204987124-0-41975";"So why do you think he's not showing?"
"204987124-0-41977";"So what could be making a meet too dangerous?"
"204987124-0-41978";"A key to what?"
"204987124-0-41979";"What can you tell me about Exile's Barrow?"
"204987124-0-41980";"Is it common for the Nords to build barrows in Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-41982";"Aren't you afraid of the durzogs?"
"204987124-0-41983";"Aren't you afraid of the durzogs?"
"204987124-0-41984";"Which clan do you serve?"
"204987124-0-41985";"Which clan do you serve?"
"204987124-0-41989";"Tell me my future, old woman, or I'll feed you to the durzogs."
"204987124-0-41991";"What can you tell me about the briarhearts?"
"204987124-0-41992";"Their chests hang open?"
"204987124-0-41993";"Do you really believe the scroll I recovered is important?"
"204987124-0-41994";"Why didn't The Rat just tie the message to the rodent he sent you instead of a map?"
"204987124-0-41995";"The harpies and Winterborn are working together?"
"204987124-0-41996";"But you're working with him now?"
"204987124-0-41997";"Why didn't The Rat just tie the message to the rodent he sent you instead of a map?"
"204987124-0-41998";"The harpies and Winterborn are working together?"
"204987124-0-41999";"Unification sounds like a lofty goal."
"204987124-0-42000";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-42001";"You mentioned a plan?"
"204987124-0-42002";"If this ritual turns people into powerful immortals, why hasn't anyone done it before?"
"204987124-0-42004";"Wait—you're volunteering?"
"204987124-0-42005";"Little Wood Elf?"
"204987124-0-42006";"I can try to find your missing squads."
"204987124-0-42009";"You're a long way from Orsinium."
"204987124-0-42011";"I'll search for survivors on the ice."
"204987124-0-42012";"Tell me more about Sorrow."
"204987124-0-42013";"Tell me about Uzdabikh's Helm."
"204987124-0-42014";"Tell me more about Sorrow."
"204987124-0-42016";"What's your squad's mission?"
"204987124-0-42017";"And if I did decide to help you, how would I get to the districts?"
"204987124-0-42018";"Yes, I'll help you."
"204987124-0-42019";"Confused how?"
"204987124-0-42020";"Any idea where the second squad may be?"
"204987124-0-42022";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-42023";"And you think he can help us?"
"204987124-0-42024";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-42025";"Why haven't you fled the city?"
"204987124-0-42026";"Are you a soldier?"
"204987124-0-42027";"You don't look like a city Orc."
"204987124-0-42028";"Why does the king want a museum?"
"204987124-0-42029";"What can you tell me about the Agra Crun?"
"204987124-0-42030";"Nice bow work, by the way."
"204987124-0-42031";"What can you tell me about <<mz:1>>?"
"204987124-0-42032";"What about <<Az:1>>?"
"204987124-0-42033";"What about <<Az:1>> and <<Az:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42034";"What about <<Az:1>> and <<z:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42035";"What about <<mz:1>> and <<z:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42036";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-42037";"Nice bow work, by the way."
"204987124-0-42038";"Tell me more about the storm."
"204987124-0-42039";"How did you get a job like this?"
"204987124-0-42040";"If you say so. I'll protect you and Egnatius from the Daedra so you can complete the ritual."
"204987124-0-42042";"Are we ready then?"
"204987124-0-42043";"So how do we complete your mission?"
"204987124-0-42044";"So, are you ready for this?"
"204987124-0-42046";"And you're sure you want to go through with it?"
"204987124-0-42048";"Who is General Malivus again?"
"204987124-0-42049";"All right …."
"204987124-0-42055";"How confident are you that this will work?"
"204987124-0-42058";"I'll be back as soon as I can."
"204987124-0-42060";"You're kind of angry, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-42061";"What have the Orcs done to deserve your vengeance?"
"204987124-0-42062";"What do these briarhearts do?"
"204987124-0-42063";"What tree are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-42064";"There won't be any more hearts once we destroy the tree."
"204987124-0-42065";"It sounds like you don't know anything about this tree either."
"204987124-0-42066";"You're kind of angry, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-42067";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-42068";"How did you become a priestess in the Imperial City?"
"204987124-0-42069";"Who's Fedar?"
"204987124-0-42071";"New business venture?"
"204987124-0-42072";"What do you do with Ogrim fingers?"
"204987124-0-42073";"Do the Imperials in the garrison know you're out here?"
"204987124-0-42074";"What can you tell me about these Ogrim traps?"
"204987124-0-42075";"We have to find the alchemist."
"204987124-0-42076";"You have no idea where we should go to look for him?"
"204987124-0-42077";"The tree ate Alinon?"
"204987124-0-42079";"Let me see if I can figure out how to lower the cage."
"204987124-0-42081";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-42082";"Why was the fleet so far north?"
"204987124-0-42083";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42085";"Tell me about the ambassador."
"204987124-0-42086";"Tell me about the ambassador."
"204987124-0-42087";"Why was the fleet so far north?"
"204987124-0-42088";"Are you talking about The Drake of Blades?"
"204987124-0-42089";"I was with her at the end. She's safe."
"204987124-0-42090";"Well, she never told me her real name."
"204987124-0-42091";"And losing these documents will cause wars?"
"204987124-0-42092";"So you knew her well?"
"204987124-0-42094";"But they'll have no records to prove it, right?"
"204987124-0-42095";"How were you introduced to the Divines, then?"
"204987124-0-42096";"So you left?"
"204987124-0-42097";"Why was the fleet so far north?"
"204987124-0-42098";"So, where did you learn this ritual?"
"204987124-0-42099";"Tell me about the ambassador."
"204987124-0-42100";"Why was the fleet so far north?"
"204987124-0-42101";"Why was the fleet so far north?"
"204987124-0-42102";"Are you going to leave the city?"
"204987124-0-42103";"Do you think the Drake will be all right down there in the Cathedral?"
"204987124-0-42104";"Do you think we'll ever see her again?"
"204987124-0-42105";"Tell me more about the demiprince."
"204987124-0-42106";"What can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-42113";"Are you eager for the barons to return?"
"204987124-0-42114";"Where did Fa-Nuit-Hen come from?"
"204987124-0-42115";"Why was your father in the White-Gold Tower?"
"204987124-0-42118";"But won't she get bored?"
"204987124-0-42119";"What have you been doing since we left the Cathedral?"
"204987124-0-42120";"She did mention fireflies …."
"204987124-0-42121";"You don't approve?"
"204987124-0-42122";"But what?"
"204987124-0-42123";"Do you think the Drake will be all right down there in the Cathedral?"
"204987124-0-42124";"I could …."
"204987124-0-42125";"That couldn't have been easy."
"204987124-0-42126";"How is Lady Sovelle dealing with her husband's death?"
"204987124-0-42127";"No desire to go live in an Orc stronghold?"
"204987124-0-42128";"How is Lady Sovelle dealing with her husband's death?"
"204987124-0-42129";"What do you think about this Orc nation?"
"204987124-0-42130";"What do you think about this Orc nation?"
"204987124-0-42131";"So you locked down the trade agreement?"
"204987124-0-42132";"Are you sure that Baron Materre will pay for his part in the frozen fleet fiasco?"
"204987124-0-42133";"So you locked down the trade agreement?"
"204987124-0-42134";"So you locked down the trade agreement?"
"204987124-0-42135";"How did you lose the pendant?"
"204987124-0-42136";"How do I know the pendant belongs to you?"
"204987124-0-42137";"How did you lose the pendant?"
"204987124-0-42138";"What about the draugr? Its your fault the draugr were awoken."
"204987124-0-42139";"Are you looking for a particular relic?"
"204987124-0-42142";"What exactly is an auricular geode?"
"204987124-0-42143";"Only Xivkyn will charge the fragments?"
"204987124-0-42144";"You too."
"204987124-0-42145";"Why was your father in the White-Gold Tower?"
"204987124-0-42146";"How could I get into the White-Gold Tower?"
"204987124-0-42147";"Why was your father in the White-Gold Tower?"
"204987124-0-42148";"I don't know. I saw a vision of him speaking to Clivia Tharn."
"204987124-0-42150";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-42152";"How do I get to the Imperial Prison?"
"204987124-0-42153";"Nothing pleasant. But it's over now."
"204987124-0-42155";"What do you mean, ""no more Mundus?"""
"204987124-0-42156";"What should be done with the Tel Var stones?"
"204987124-0-42157";"What did you mean by ""no more Mundus?"""
"204987124-0-42160";"I prefer Lady Cinnabar's books."
"204987124-0-42165";"Wait, Phrastus of Elinhir? I've read your books."
"204987124-0-42166";"What do the Daedra want with Tel Var stones?"
"204987124-0-42169";"I thought the Ayleids did terrible things."
"204987124-0-42170";"I prefer your books over those by Phrastus of Elinhir."
"204987124-0-42176";"Is the scroll's enchantment still working?"
"204987124-0-42178";"What can you tell me about the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-42179";"Yes?"
"204987124-0-42180";"She's not dead, you know."
"204987124-0-42181";"What can you tell me about the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-42182";"You're a fraud. And it's your fault the draugr were awakened."
"204987124-0-42183";"I think I hear another Dragon priest! Quick, hide! <Trick\n Narsis>"
"204987124-0-42184";"Not exactly. She wants to prove you're wrong about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-42189";"At least he dealt with your draugr problem."
"204987124-0-42192";"Tell me about this fog."
"204987124-0-42193";"What happened to the chief?"
"204987124-0-42196";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-42198";"And your master is helping the Orcs?"
"204987124-0-42199";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-42200";"And he happened to show up just when the Orcs needed help?"
"204987124-0-42201";"Tell me about the Orc village."
"204987124-0-42202";"And you're certain Narsis Dren went into the barrow?"
"204987124-0-42203";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-42204";"Stories?"
"204987124-0-42205";"How's that?"
"204987124-0-42206";"According to the notebook, you did something to awaken the draugr."
"204987124-0-42208";"That doesn't sound like a hero talking."
"204987124-0-42209";"A Dragon priest?"
"204987124-0-42210";"Costumes?"
"204987124-0-42211";"So people dress up like werewolves?"
"204987124-0-42212";"I found these burial urns. <<1>> thinks they will open the tomb."
"204987124-0-42213";"Actually, <<1>> could be right."
"204987124-0-42215";"I saw a vision of <<1>>."
"204987124-0-42216";"No, <<1>> didn't think much of King Joile—or the siege."
"204987124-0-42218";"I saw a vision of <<1>>. He's connected, somehow."
"204987124-0-42221";"Not exactly. One of these urns contains the ashes of Baloth's lieutenant."
"204987124-0-42230";"How do you know she's still alive?"
"204987124-0-42231";"Tell me about the High Elf."
"204987124-0-42232";"Why doesn't King Kurog ask the Daggerfall Covenant for help?"
"204987124-0-42233";"More personal than Kurog's allies?"
"204987124-0-42234";"You're rebuilding the city of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42237";"Tell me about your daughter."
"204987124-0-42238";"I'll find your daughter."
"204987124-0-42239";"Why would a religious cult attack random travelers?"
"204987124-0-42240";"I can try to find your friends."
"204987124-0-42243";"Where's the High Elf?"

"204987124-0-42249";"Orsinium merchant's permit?"
"204987124-0-42250";"Tell me about Jaeloreh."
"204987124-0-42251";"What's so unusual about those eggs?"
"204987124-0-42252";"""Produced?"""
"204987124-0-42254";"The traders went after the supplies on their own?"
"204987124-0-42257";"You let defenseless peasants go after the marauders?"
"204987124-0-42259";"I'll go help the chief."
"204987124-0-42260";"I … don't know?"
"204987124-0-42261";"He said you wanted the Guardian dead, too."
"204987124-0-42262";"<<1>> gave it to me."
"204987124-0-42263";"Who are you and how did you get involved?"
"204987124-0-42264";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-42265";"Did you see any sign of Khoruzoth in there?"
"204987124-0-42266";"Did you see any sign of Khoruzoth in there?"
"204987124-0-42267";"So you and Meram are partners?"
"204987124-0-42269";"Why is Orsinium under siege?"
"204987124-0-42270";"Who is the Orc king?"
"204987124-0-42271";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-42272";"You traded a meal for a duel with <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42273";"Why was she so angry?"
"204987124-0-42274";"Truly?"
"204987124-0-42275";"How do you know <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42276";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-42277";"All right. Where should I look?"
"204987124-0-42278";"If that's true, why do you need special food?"
"204987124-0-42281";"I'm told you want me to kill Nikolvara the Durzog Whistler too."
"204987124-0-42282";"But I need to fight them first?"
"204987124-0-42283";"And this phial will work on any of the undead in the Sanctum?"
"204987124-0-42284";"If I free these spirits in Thukhozod's Sanctum, what will happen to them?"
"204987124-0-42285";"Is that all?"
"204987124-0-42286";"Who's Ice-Heart?"
"204987124-0-42287";"I can deal with Ice-Heart."
"204987124-0-42288";"The supplies from the caravan?"
"204987124-0-42290";"How can I help?"

"204987124-0-42292";"<Destroy the Warden's Tome.>"
"204987124-0-42294";"I was invited …."
"204987124-0-42295";"Any idea where the fog comes from?"
"204987124-0-42296";"Maybe this note will help you find the supplies."
"204987124-0-42297";"And this book will help me?"
"204987124-0-42300";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-42302";"I'll go to Orsinium and see what I can learn."
"204987124-0-42303";"I'll look for the control center."
"204987124-0-42304";"That's why you're giving me so much grief?"
"204987124-0-42305";"What should I look for in the city?"
"204987124-0-42306";"What are you chief of?"
"204987124-0-42307";"Why would someone betray the Orc clans?"
"204987124-0-42309";"You could petition the king and ask him to decide what to do with the constructs."
"204987124-0-42310";"What if Neramo takes them to Orsinium and never returns here?"
"204987124-0-42311";"I'm just trying to find someone who came across a large amount of gold recently."
"204987124-0-42312";"Tell me more about Ambassador Lazdutha."
"204987124-0-42313";"Why are you meeting the ambassador in Morkul instead of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42314";"Why are you meeting the ambassador in Morkul instead of Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42315";"I just need to find out how he got the gold."
"204987124-0-42316";"Smell him?"
"204987124-0-42318";"What discussion? I didn't hear a thing."
"204987124-0-42321";"You don't say."
"204987124-0-42323";"Can I ask what business you're in?"
"204987124-0-42325";"You sell medicine?"
"204987124-0-42326";"What do you know about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42327";"Why is it so important to find Morkuldin?"
"204987124-0-42328";"What is the Hand of Morkul?"
"204987124-0-42330";"It sounds like you're jealous of your sister."
"204987124-0-42331";"Who do those statues represent?"
"204987124-0-42332";"Are you certain the statues are the key?"
"204987124-0-42334";"This letter to Urfon Ice-Heart says otherwise."
"204987124-0-42335";"So the clan Orcs starve?"
"204987124-0-42336";"Just tell me where the Winterborn took the stolen supplies."
"204987124-0-42337";"The information you passed on cost lives and gave the Winterborn supplies."
"204987124-0-42340";"I'll tell the Guard about this. Don't try to leave the city."
"204987124-0-42346";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-42348";"She mentioned poachers."
"204987124-0-42349";"Wait, you were a chief? Chief of what?"
"204987124-0-42350";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-42351";"Good to know."
"204987124-0-42352";"What happened to your old clan?"
"204987124-0-42353";"Why did the ogres take your books?"
"204987124-0-42355";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42356";"Why?"
"204987124-0-42357";"All right. Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42358";"Why does that matter?"
"204987124-0-42360";"All right, I'll leave."
"204987124-0-42361";"What will go faster?"
"204987124-0-42362";"Why does <<1>> need a <<z:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42363";"What then?"
"204987124-0-42365";"Got it."
"204987124-0-42366";"You mentioned Reachmen invaders."
"204987124-0-42367";"Why is it so important to light the pyre?"
"204987124-0-42368";"Why is it so important to light the pyre?"
"204987124-0-42369";"Tell me about your order."
"204987124-0-42370";"So there's something wrong in the wild?"
"204987124-0-42371";"What can you tell me about this totem?"
"204987124-0-42372";"So you need me to cleanse this corruption?"
"204987124-0-42373";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-42374";"Chief Bazrag sent them?"
"204987124-0-42375";"I won't let that happen."
"204987124-0-42376";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-42377";"So, how do we stop them?"
"204987124-0-42379";"And you want me to kill <<1>> as well?"
"204987124-0-42380";"There was a confrontation in the throne room."
"204987124-0-42381";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-42383";"Why would your own guardians try to stop me?"
"204987124-0-42385";"All right, I'll open the door and light the great pyre."
"204987124-0-42386";"All right, I'll open the door and light the great pyre."
"204987124-0-42387";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-42388";"Where are your friends now?"
"204987124-0-42389";"Where are your friends now?"
"204987124-0-42391";"Woke what up?"
"204987124-0-42392";"I don't think I'll ever forget the taste."
"204987124-0-42394";"You work for the king?"
"204987124-0-42395";"It's not going right I take it?"
"204987124-0-42396";"But the small minority gets abducted?"
"204987124-0-42398";"What can you tell me about these Riekr?"
"204987124-0-42399";"They wanted to embarrass the king."
"204987124-0-42400";"They wanted to embarrass the king."
"204987124-0-42402";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-42403";"I don't know if I'm comfortable hunting harpies as food."
"204987124-0-42405";"Is violence your solution to every problem?"
"204987124-0-42406";"All right, what can I do for King Kurog?"
"204987124-0-42407";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-42408";"How can I help you, King Kurog?"
"204987124-0-42409";"Tell me more about what happened here."
"204987124-0-42410";"I'm not an outsider. I'm an Orc."
"204987124-0-42411";"Sounds like you've got a suggestion."
"204987124-0-42413";"All right, let's go find the exit."
"204987124-0-42414";"Defenses? You mean the constructs?"
"204987124-0-42416";"<<1>>. I serve <<2>>."
"204987124-0-42417";"Why did you travel with <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42418";"It doesn't sound like you know. The Guard doesn't tell you much, do they?"
"204987124-0-42420";"Explain yourself."
"204987124-0-42421";"Why does the Guard think <<1>> is responsible?"
"204987124-0-42422";"Why does the Guard think <<1>> is responsible?"
"204987124-0-42423";"But what exactly was it?"
"204987124-0-42424";"At least tell me why <<1>> was arrested."
"204987124-0-42425";"Who was the witness?"
"204987124-0-42426";"<<1>>? I was told you were dead. I delivered the news to Baloth myself!"
"204987124-0-42427";"If this is true, I must warn <<1>>."
"204987124-0-42428";"Actually, I have information regarding <<1>>."
"204987124-0-42429";"Any last advice before I go down there?"
"204987124-0-42431";"<<1>> is behind all of this?"
"204987124-0-42432";"Do you have any proof of this plan?"
"204987124-0-42433";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-42434";"I was told you were dead. I delivered the news to Baloth myself."
"204987124-0-42437";"What must we do?"
"204987124-0-42439";"The Orcs won't like that."
"204987124-0-42440";"If I did want to join, where would I go?"
"204987124-0-42443";"Is there any way around the spike room?"
"204987124-0-42444";"Makes sense. What now?"
"204987124-0-42447";"I'll inform Ulghesh."
"204987124-0-42448";"""They?"" Aren't you part of Shatul as well?"
"204987124-0-42450";"Is that a good idea?"
"204987124-0-42452";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-42454";"You'll do fine."
"204987124-0-42456";"How can I join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-42457";"Bazrag's fine, but I need to know how he was captured."
"204987124-0-42458";"So Bazrag didn't send warriors to attack the temple in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42459";"We're still trying to figure out who's behind all this."
"204987124-0-42462";"Chief Bazrag is safe. You have my word on that."
"204987124-0-42465";"You sound like your old self again."
"204987124-0-42466";"So how do we get inside?"
"204987124-0-42467";"So how do we get inside?"
"204987124-0-42468";"A disguise is a good idea. Seen any of those cultists recently?"
"204987124-0-42469";"Just tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-42470";"I'll go see if I can find something we can use."
"204987124-0-42473";"Do you really think the clan chiefs will listen to me?"
"204987124-0-42474";"Tell me about Clan Tumnosh."
"204987124-0-42475";"Tell me about Clan Morkul."
"204987124-0-42476";"Tell me about Clan Tumnosh."
"204987124-0-42477";"Tell me about Clan Tumnosh."
"204987124-0-42478";"[Lie] I work for the harbormaster. There's a problem with your shipment in the warehouse."
"204987124-0-42480";"Of course. Right this way."
"204987124-0-42482";"Are you sure splitting the party is a good idea?"
"204987124-0-42484";"Let's rendezvous back here after we find something."
"204987124-0-42487";"Isn't that like the leaf calling the tree green?"
"204987124-0-42488";"You don't have anything to prove."
"204987124-0-42489";"Then let's go do something to make your family proud."
"204987124-0-42492";"I found this inside the ruins. Are you interested?"
"204987124-0-42493";"I'll look for you in Orsinium."
"204987124-0-42494";"I'll speak to her, then."
"204987124-0-42496";"You stole the mug. Why shouldn't I turn you in?"
"204987124-0-42497";"But you helped him. Why shouldn't I turn you in?"
"204987124-0-42498";"This mission … I'm not sure I know all the details."
"204987124-0-42499";"How are our rituals different from the ones celebrated in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42500";"As the council demands?"
"204987124-0-42501";"You don't have to do this."
"204987124-0-42503";"I suppose we have to go in there next."
"204987124-0-42505";"Lucrative? How so?"
"204987124-0-42509";"Talviah died so I could get the information we need. They're going to attack the moot."
"204987124-0-42511";"Now isn't the time for this. I need you to warn Solgra and Bazrag. They're in danger."
"204987124-0-42512";"I'm sorry for all of this."
"204987124-0-42513";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-42514";"I'm sorry for all of this."
"204987124-0-42515";"They're going to take Bazrag at the inn and claim that Solgra leads the Vosh Rakh."
"204987124-0-42516";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-42517";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-42518";"Hail Sithis."
"204987124-0-42519";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-42520";"What do you recommend?"
"204987124-0-42521";"All right, I'll search for the stolen goods."
"204987124-0-42523";"All right, here you are."
"204987124-0-42525";"Now, about my payment …."
"204987124-0-42527";"We lost our amulets, too."
"204987124-0-42528";"I learned that the Vosh Rakh are hiding in the city. They're going to attack the chiefs at the moot."
"204987124-0-42530";"Return to Orsinium and warn Chief Bazrag. I'll meet you there shortly."
"204987124-0-42531";"How does one become Agra Crun?"
"204987124-0-42532";"What does Malacath want with me?"
"204987124-0-42534";"What will you do now, Azrath?"
"204987124-0-42535";"Bazrag's fine, but I need to know how he was captured."
"204987124-0-42536";"Any ideas on how I can get past the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-42537";"I could steal it from him."
"204987124-0-42538";"Any ideas on how I can get past the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-42539";"The soldier you were talking to, do you know her?"
"204987124-0-42540";"Do you know where I can find this stinky merchant?"
"204987124-0-42541";"I'm not sure what you're getting at."
"204987124-0-42542";"And …?"
"204987124-0-42544";"How can you get me into the inn?"
"204987124-0-42545";"You can't be serious."
"204987124-0-42546";"Why would Shatul fall into chaos without a chief?"
"204987124-0-42547";"You're saying you'd prevent that?"
"204987124-0-42548";"Do you really want to become chief? You're very … relaxed."
"204987124-0-42549";"Then who should lead?"
"204987124-0-42550";"Kill your friend? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-42551";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-42552";"Why did <<1>> attack your chief?"
"204987124-0-42553";"Kill your friend? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-42554";"Is that a bad thing?"
"204987124-0-42555";"Why did <<1>> attack your chief?"
"204987124-0-42556";"What kind of guard are you?"
"204987124-0-42558";"Mind if I go take a look?"
"204987124-0-42559";"Dragonstar Caravan Company?"
"204987124-0-42561";"So you're hiring?"
"204987124-0-42562";"Get moving, before I change my mind."
"204987124-0-42563";"No thanks. That doesn't sound all that impressive."
"204987124-0-42566";"Why did you send soldiers to the inn?"
"204987124-0-42567";"Did you know that your soldiers were infiltrated by the Vosh Rakh?"
"204987124-0-42568";"Forge-Mother Alga told me. She's the Vosh Rakh's leader."
"204987124-0-42571";"Where are Chief Bazrag and Eveli?"
"204987124-0-42573";"Was this Kurog's plan all along?"
"204987124-0-42576";"Was this Kurog's plan all along?"
"204987124-0-42577";"Won't killing the chiefs turn the clans against Kurog?"
"204987124-0-42578";"Why do Alga and Kurog hate Bazrag so much?"
"204987124-0-42579";"Even if it means killing innocents?"
"204987124-0-42581";"That's why you blamed Bazrag for the attack on the temple?"
"204987124-0-42582";"Was this Kurog's plan all along?"
"204987124-0-42583";"What about them?"
"204987124-0-42585";"I've been there. It was full of spiders."
"204987124-0-42591";"What happened to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42592";"Did <<1>> ever fear you would challenge him?"
"204987124-0-42593";"Did you blame her for leaving?"
"204987124-0-42594";"What happened to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42595";"What are we finishing?"
"204987124-0-42597";"I see. What now?"
"204987124-0-42598";"I slew <<1>> and brought you the <<z:2>>. I could be a contender."
"204987124-0-42599";"All right. Never mind."
"204987124-0-42601";"Poison? What poison?"
"204987124-0-42602";"That's horrible!"
"204987124-0-42603";"Then why do it?"
"204987124-0-42604";"Then why do it?"
"204987124-0-42609";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-42610";"Explain yourself."
"204987124-0-42611";"I had a feeling you weren't ""<<1>>."" So who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-42612";"Then tell me what I missed."
"204987124-0-42613";"<<1>> mentioned you."
"204987124-0-42614";"Then we should get moving."
"204987124-0-42615";"Do you think Kurog planned this from the beginning?"
"204987124-0-42616";"Why are Kurog and Alga so determined to get rid of you?"
"204987124-0-42617";"So he turned to this plan in desperation?"
"204987124-0-42618";"Do you think Kurog planned this from the beginning?"
"204987124-0-42619";"Are the Orcs really that fickle?"
"204987124-0-42620";"It doesn't?"
"204987124-0-42621";"Do you think Kurog planned this from the beginning?"
"204987124-0-42622";"Do you think Kurog planned this from the beginning?"
"204987124-0-42623";"Would that be so bad?"
"204987124-0-42624";"But what do you think of him?"
"204987124-0-42631";"No, not me."
"204987124-0-42633";"What does your name mean?"
"204987124-0-42634";"What exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-42635";"I'll look into it."
"204987124-0-42637";"Why not? <<1>> would make a good chief."
"204987124-0-42639";"And you want the pack leader's pelt as well?"
"204987124-0-42640";"You and Eveli need to find a place to hide until this is all over."
"204987124-0-42642";"Malacath led me by stealth and guile through his unsuspecting enemies."
"204987124-0-42643";"So why do you want the other werewolf pelts?"
"204987124-0-42646";"I don't know. It still seems like cannibalism."
"204987124-0-42648";"Wait. How is a <<z:1>> different from a <<z:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42651";"I'm all right, my vision returned."
"204987124-0-42653";"You're right, it stopped. Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-42655";"If anyone else swallows a bear's tooth, they're going to look more sickly."
"204987124-0-42656";"Kurog and Alga. They plan to kill the chiefs and blame you for organizing the Vosh Rakh."
"204987124-0-42657";"So you have to travel to find them?"
"204987124-0-42658";"Go find a place to hide until this is all over."
"204987124-0-42659";"You're the egg merchant from Orsinium, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-42660";"You're comfortable selling eggs laid by hexed bird-people?"
"204987124-0-42661";"What are you doing here, Nednor?"
"204987124-0-42662";"What about what's inside?"
"204987124-0-42663";"She suggested that might be some kind of secret passage."
"204987124-0-42664";"Anything else before we head out?"
"204987124-0-42666";"Kurog betrayed us all. I'm ready to end this."
"204987124-0-42667";"Kurog betrayed us all. I'm ready to end this."
"204987124-0-42668";"I saw a few echateres outside your camp."
"204987124-0-42669";"What if I find another Wrothgar ogre with healthy organs? Would those work?"
"204987124-0-42670";"Solgra gave me a key to the library. She thought the tunnels would be accessible through there."
"204987124-0-42671";"Kurog betrayed us all. I'm ready to end this."
"204987124-0-42672";"Kurog betrayed us all. I'm ready to end this."
"204987124-0-42673";"So you're build on the ruins of the old city?"
"204987124-0-42680";"No, sorry. I just got here."
"204987124-0-42686";"And that's … good?"
"204987124-0-42687";"Interesting."
"204987124-0-42688";"What can you tell me about this phial?"
"204987124-0-42689";"What can you tell me about this phial?"
"204987124-0-42690";"What can you tell me about this phial?"
"204987124-0-42691";"I see. But why does <<1>> need a <<z:2>>?"
"204987124-0-42692";"All right. Never mind."
"204987124-0-42693";"All right. Never mind."
"204987124-0-42694";"Can you even become chief?"
"204987124-0-42695";"Do you think that will work?"
"204987124-0-42696";"What do you think of <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42697";"Why did you disguise yourself?"
"204987124-0-42698";"Do you hold that against him?"
"204987124-0-42701";"Deal. What should I tell <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42702";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-42703";"How would I do that?"
"204987124-0-42704";"And if not?"
"204987124-0-42706";"I'll head there now."
"204987124-0-42707";"All right, I can do that."
"204987124-0-42708";"There's another option. I could become chief of Shatul."
"204987124-0-42710";"What if I find something? How will she be punished?"
"204987124-0-42712";"Is there a trick to it?"
"204987124-0-42713";"Weird sound?"
"204987124-0-42714";"What can you tell me about this corruption?"
"204987124-0-42715";"<<1>> said she traded you armor."
"204987124-0-42717";"You've had enough.  Now, tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-42718";"The book is about Boethiah betraying Trinimac."
"204987124-0-42719";"What about this sword I found at the giant camp?"
"204987124-0-42720";"<<1>> was away from Shatul. He said it sounded like you."
"204987124-0-42722";"<<1>> thinks you're behind <<2>>'s death."
"204987124-0-42723";"<<1>> said she had the book to study Orsinium politics."
"204987124-0-42724";"He heard <<1>>. She was chanting outside the village."
"204987124-0-42725";"All right. What do you propose?"
"204987124-0-42728";"Do you know where you might go next?"
"204987124-0-42731";"Why have you returned?"
"204987124-0-42732";"Why have you returned?"
"204987124-0-42733";"What events?"
"204987124-0-42734";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-42735";"Will you help me?"
"204987124-0-42737";"Wait! I don't understand!"
"204987124-0-42738";"Are you upset about the decision to change the temple to Malacath?"
"204987124-0-42740";"What are you planning?"
"204987124-0-42741";"Will you stay as his advisor?"
"204987124-0-42742";"Are you upset about the decision to change the temple to Malacath?"
"204987124-0-42743";"Are you upset about the decision to change the temple to Malacath?"
"204987124-0-42744";"How do you feel about this king thing?"
"204987124-0-42745";"I wanted to say goodbye."
"204987124-0-42746";"What's going to happen to Kurog's body?"
"204987124-0-42747";"How do you feel about this king thing?"
"204987124-0-42748";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-42749";"What does your ankle have to do with your guts?"
"204987124-0-42750";"I don't think that's how it works."
"204987124-0-42752";"So there was an avalanche then?"
"204987124-0-42753";"I'm sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-42754";"How are Avreg, Orgotha and the others?"
"204987124-0-42755";"Go on."
"204987124-0-42756";"What happened up there?"
"204987124-0-42757";"How's Winks?"
"204987124-0-42758";"Do you think you'll stay in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42759";"How are Avreg, Orgotha and the others?"
"204987124-0-42760";"Do you think you'll stay in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-42762";"Did King Bazrag talk to you?"
"204987124-0-42763";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-42764";"What type of art do ogres make?"
"204987124-0-42765";"What is Morkuldin?"
"204987124-0-42766";"What if I find another Wrothgar ogre with healthy organs? Would those work?"
"204987124-0-42767";"All right. Tell me about the <<Az:1>>."
"204987124-0-42768";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-42769";"Did King Bazrag talk to you?"
"204987124-0-42770";"What's stopping you?"
"204987124-0-42771";"Did King Bazrag talk to you?"
"204987124-0-42772";"Any thoughts on what you're going to do with your own archery unit?"
"204987124-0-42773";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-42774";"I have other places to go."
"204987124-0-42775";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-42777";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-42782";"Where was home?"
"204987124-0-42784";"If you don't like it here, why not go home?"
"204987124-0-42785";"Never mind. How did <<1>> betray <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-42786";"Then what?"
"204987124-0-42787";"What can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-42788";"Why is Orsinium under siege?"
"204987124-0-42790";"That's my name. And I don't serve anyone."
"204987124-0-42791";"Was your <<1>> the one who killed Baloth's brother?"
"204987124-0-42792";"Then why not end it?"
"204987124-0-42796";"What did your tribe plan to do with it?"
"204987124-0-42797";"Doesn't that make it easier for an enemy to kill you?"
"204987124-0-42798";"Does it hurt?"
"204987124-0-42799";"Do you have any regrets about replacing your own heart?"
"204987124-0-42800";"Doesn't that make it easier for an enemy to kill you?"
"204987124-0-42801";"Is it wise to return to your tribe?"
"204987124-0-42803";"Why is it so important to find Morkuldin?"
"204987124-0-42806";"Do you sell coats like that?"
"204987124-0-42811";"You mentioned your husband. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-42812";"You mentioned your husband. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-42813";"You aren't upset?"
"204987124-0-42814";"Will Shatul accept <<1>> as chief?"
"204987124-0-42815";"How can you be so gullible? Look, are you going to help me or not?"
"204987124-0-42816";"Then come to Paragon's Remembrance. I need someone I can trust."
"204987124-0-42817";"And then you get adventurers to do the work?"
"204987124-0-42820";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-42821";"How do I find this caravan?"
"204987124-0-42825";"I was unable to complete the challenges."
"204987124-0-42829";"What's the best way to do that?"
"204987124-0-42831";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-42833";"All right. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-42835";"That doesn't sound like a problem."
"204987124-0-42836";"I'm listening, Speaker."
"204987124-0-42837";"I'm listening, Speaker."
"204987124-0-42838";"I'm ready to hear your proposal."
"204987124-0-42839";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-42840";"I'm ready to hear your proposal."
"204987124-0-42843";"I'm ready to hear your proposal."
"204987124-0-42846";"I suppose that's as good a place to start as any."
"204987124-0-42847";"What's the Withered Rose?"
"204987124-0-42848";"I'm interested."
"204987124-0-42849";"So the Dark Brotherhood is a group of paid assassins."
"204987124-0-42850";"So the Night Mother is your leader?"
"204987124-0-42851";"Who's the Night Mother?"
"204987124-0-42852";"What's the Black Sacrament?"
"204987124-0-42853";"Do you have a plan for how I escape after getting detained?"
"204987124-0-42854";"How did your sister come to join an Akatosh cult?"
"204987124-0-42855";"You killed your sister's best friend?"
"204987124-0-42856";"So she left you and joined the cult?"
"204987124-0-42857";"And this is a bad thing?"
"204987124-0-42858";"And that's it?"
"204987124-0-42867";"You're obviously dangerous, so I suppose I have no choice."
"204987124-0-42869";"Let's go see the Grand Chanter."
"204987124-0-42870";"The Black Hand?"
"204987124-0-42871";"So there are other Sanctuaries?"
"204987124-0-42872";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-42873";"Why are you called a Speaker?"
"204987124-0-42874";"Why do you need to do that?"
"204987124-0-42875";"I've never met <<1>>. How will I convince her?"
"204987124-0-42879";"I'll look for your sister at the old Akatosh shrines."
"204987124-0-42881";"I'll see what I can find out."
"204987124-0-42887";"I'm just trying to help. Speaking of which …."
"204987124-0-42888";"No. Just a friend."
"204987124-0-42891";"You should talk to her, Josseline."
"204987124-0-42892";"Knives? What knives?"
"204987124-0-42896";"Have you always been the Matron of this Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-42897";"I heard something about a Dark Brotherhood member being murdered."
"204987124-0-42898";"Did you advance through the ranks in this Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-42899";"Any idea who the murderer is?"
"204987124-0-42900";"How do I advance in the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42901";"Who would dare challenge the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42902";"What happens as I advance?"
"204987124-0-42903";"Tell me more about yourself, Matron."
"204987124-0-42904";"All right. I'll look into it. What then?"
"204987124-0-42905";"What exactly did <<1>> want me to do?"
"204987124-0-42913";"<<1>>. Tell me what's going on."
"204987124-0-42914";"All right, I'll get moving."
"204987124-0-42915";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-42920";"All right. I'll let her know."
"204987124-0-42921";"I need to get into <<1>>."
"204987124-0-42922";"But you haven't seen her for a long time?"
"204987124-0-42924";"So this is where you grew up?"
"204987124-0-42925";"What if I don't want to pay?"
"204987124-0-42928";"I'll think about it."
"204987124-0-42930";"I can take care of myself."
"204987124-0-42931";"So what's your story, Tanek?"
"204987124-0-42932";"So what's your story, Tanek?"
"204987124-0-42934";"<<1>> is dead. <<2>> is the new guildmaster."
"204987124-0-42936";"What kind of favor?"
"204987124-0-42941";"Why come to Anvil, if it's so much trouble?"
"204987124-0-42942";"Who is this Governor you keep mentioning?"
"204987124-0-42943";"What will you be doing while I'm retrieving the stash?"
"204987124-0-42944";"What will you be doing while I'm acquiring the stash?"
"204987124-0-42945";"I'm told you know where he keeps his hidden gold."
"204987124-0-42949";"Anyone asks, you never saw me."
"204987124-0-42950";"What if I help you with that dwindling pile of winnings? What's Qamar worth to you?"
"204987124-0-42951";"Are you asking me to steal your warehouse back?"
"204987124-0-42952";"I'll meet <<1>> at the warehouse."
"204987124-0-42956";"I'll leave you to your business then."
"204987124-0-42958";"I'll take my share now."
"204987124-0-42960";"And that's how you came to the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42961";"That sounds terrible."
"204987124-0-42962";"Anything else I should know about the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42963";"So how'd you wind up in the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42964";"There are rules?"
"204987124-0-42965";"I'll sharpen more than your ear if you don't tell me where Qamar hides his gold."
"204987124-0-42967";"Qamar sent me to make a withdrawal and he's kind of impatient, but I'll tell him you're too busy."
"204987124-0-42969";"Then why not tell me part of the pass-phrase? No one has to know."
"204987124-0-42973";"Go ahead, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-42974";"So what's your story, Tanek?"
"204987124-0-42975";"Why do they call you Green-Venom-Tongue?"
"204987124-0-42976";"What's a Shadowscale?"
"204987124-0-42977";"Any advice you want to share with a new recruit?"
"204987124-0-42978";"Former Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-42979";"Do you like living here?"
"204987124-0-42980";"Why do you have a werewolf in that cage?"
"204987124-0-42981";"Hildegard sounds like she has an interesting story."
"204987124-0-42982";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-42983";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-42984";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-42985";"Are you always this forward?"
"204987124-0-42986";"Later? Where would you like me to meet you?"
"204987124-0-42987";"I'm still not sure how all this works."
"204987124-0-42988";"I heard that a few members had been murdered."
"204987124-0-42989";"You come from a noble family?"
"204987124-0-42990";"What should I know about the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42991";"It sounds like the Brotherhood worships the Night Mother."
"204987124-0-42992";"And we consider that to be a contract?"
"204987124-0-42993";"Are you always this forward?"
"204987124-0-42994";"Sounds like someone's hunting the Brotherhood."
"204987124-0-42995";"What should I know about the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-42996";"I need to speak with <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43001";"""We burn our truth upon their canvas."""
"204987124-0-43003";"""The Wheel turns ever onward."""
"204987124-0-43004";"You mentioned <<1>>. Who is he?"
"204987124-0-43008";"<<1>> said if <<2>> recovered the dowry, the Iron Wheel would return to Taneth."
"204987124-0-43011";"What now?"
"204987124-0-43012";"<<1>> was blackmailing the people you sent us to investigate. I stole this from him."
"204987124-0-43020";"My training?"
"204987124-0-43021";"So the ship's captain sailed you to the wrong port?"
"204987124-0-43022";"I could charter a ship for you."
"204987124-0-43023";"If you were bound for Hammerfell, how did you end up in Anvil?"
"204987124-0-43024";"There must be someone interested in your particular talents."
"204987124-0-43025";"If you were bound for Hammerfell, how did you end up in Anvil?"
"204987124-0-43026";"Why would Raynor charter a ship to Anvil?"
"204987124-0-43027";"What were you going to Hammerfell for?"
"204987124-0-43028";"You want the Dwarven relics for yourselves?"
"204987124-0-43029";"How did you end up in Anvil if you were heading for Hammerfell?"
"204987124-0-43030";"There must be somewhere you'd like to work."
"204987124-0-43031";"How did you end up in Anvil if you were heading for Hammerfell?"
"204987124-0-43032";"Is there any way I can convince you to give her another chance?"
"204987124-0-43034";"All right, I'll bring you a wyrd blossom."
"204987124-0-43036";"If her singing is that amusing, just tell the audience she's a comedian."
"204987124-0-43038";"Excellent. I'll let Kireth know."
"204987124-0-43040";"I'll pay you to hire her, with enough extra to make it worth your while."
"204987124-0-43042";"I'll let Kireth know we reached an agreement."
"204987124-0-43044";"If I compensate you and throw in something extra, will you hire Raynor and pay him for his work?"
"204987124-0-43046";"I'll send Raynor your way."
"204987124-0-43048";"I'd be careful what you say about my friend, Raynor. An honest bank would want an honest worker."
"204987124-0-43050";"I'll send Raynor right over."
"204987124-0-43052";"Raynor's been known to tinker with things. Why not hire him to make your forge more efficient?"
"204987124-0-43055";"All right. I'll recover your stolen ingots."
"204987124-0-43056";"I spoke to Frunda. She's agreed to let you balance the bank's accounts."
"204987124-0-43058";"She can't wait for you to get to it."
"204987124-0-43059";"I'm certain you will."
"204987124-0-43060";"Go and show them what you can do!"
"204987124-0-43061";"That's probably a reasonable precaution."
"204987124-0-43063";"Good luck with the job."
"204987124-0-43065";"They're going to love you."
"204987124-0-43067";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-43068";"How did you learn the Iron Wheel's plans to depart?"
"204987124-0-43071";"Then scout <<1>>. Look for the best way in."
"204987124-0-43073";"See you there."
"204987124-0-43074";"I helped you bring <<1>> home. Help me do the same thing for <<2>>."
"204987124-0-43075";"That's good to know."
"204987124-0-43076";"I promise. Now, about <<1>> …."
"204987124-0-43077";"You can impersonate an Iron Wheel soldier?"
"204987124-0-43079";"I'll bring the journal. We'll find you an Iron Wheel uniform when we get there."
"204987124-0-43080";"All right. I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-43082";"Sounds good."
"204987124-0-43084";"I'll find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43086";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-43088";"Okay."
"204987124-0-43089";"Which merchants, exactly?"
"204987124-0-43090";"I'll get that invitation."
"204987124-0-43091";"I need to get an invitation. Who should I steal it from?"
"204987124-0-43092";"Never. But we can figure out who they are after we escape."
"204987124-0-43093";"Locate <<1>> and make life harder for <<2>>? I'll do it."
"204987124-0-43095";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-43096";"I have evidence. I'll trade it for <<1>>'s freedom."
"204987124-0-43097";"Deal. Here, read this journal. It will prove <<1>>' guilt."
"204987124-0-43099";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43100";"Why would I free you?"
"204987124-0-43101";"If you tell us where to find <<1>>, you'll get a lockpick."
"204987124-0-43104";"Hold that thought."
"204987124-0-43109";"They knew we were coming all along?"
"204987124-0-43111";"I'll join the Thieves Guild."
"204987124-0-43112";"Taneth can have <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43116";"I am <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43117";"How could humming a song be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-43118";"How could singing a song be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-43119";"So you're a professional musician?"
"204987124-0-43122";"What are the dro-m'Athra exactly?"
"204987124-0-43126";"How so?"
"204987124-0-43127";"What will happen to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43129";"<<1>> had an offer for the Thieves Guild."
"204987124-0-43130";"And you think that's the cause of the corruption?"
"204987124-0-43134";"I have to dress up?"
"204987124-0-43137";"I was."
"204987124-0-43138";"You're right, I don't want to distract you."
"204987124-0-43140";"You're the best choice for reaching the upper floors of the palace."
"204987124-0-43142";"You're the best choice for mingling at a wedding."
"204987124-0-43144";"You're right, I was only joking."
"204987124-0-43146";"All right. What do we know about him?"
"204987124-0-43147";"You want me to break into the Iron Wheel's headquarters?"
"204987124-0-43153";"What's the point of placing your sigil in the grotto?"
"204987124-0-43154";"Tell me about the new commodore."
"204987124-0-43155";"Tell me about the new commodore."
"204987124-0-43157";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-43158";"Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-43164";"I can do that."
"204987124-0-43167";"So what brought you here?"
"204987124-0-43171";"You look ridiculous."
"204987124-0-43174";"You're right. You look ridiculous."
"204987124-0-43175";"You look ridiculous."
"204987124-0-43176";"You look ridiculous."
"204987124-0-43177";"Why are you locking the gates?"
"204987124-0-43180";"Sounds like you don't believe it."
"204987124-0-43184";"Where can I find this ""Desert Falcon?"""
"204987124-0-43185";"Why are you looking for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43186";"Do the contents tell me where he is?"
"204987124-0-43188";"Where in Grahtwood, exactly?"
"204987124-0-43189";"Where in Alik'r, exactly?"
"204987124-0-43190";"Where in Deshaan, exactly?"
"204987124-0-43192";"The Iron Wheel killed many good people. Is their blood on your hands, or is it on <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43201";"[Lie] ""Ram's Beak"" is a bounty hunter. I need to warn my friend, <<1>>!"
"204987124-0-43202";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43203";"Have you seen <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43204";"Then tell me everything you remember about <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43205";"Tell me what you know about <<1>>. His life depends on it."
"204987124-0-43206";"I thought the Iron Wheel was no longer a threat to Abah's Landing."
"204987124-0-43208";"I'll give it to her."
"204987124-0-43209";"[Lie] You fool, it's <<1>>! She's disguised as a servant."
"204987124-0-43213";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-43218";"Who are these pirates you keep mentioning?"
"204987124-0-43220";"So how can I help you deal with the Wake Walker pirates?"
"204987124-0-43221";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43223";"All right. Let's figure out where the treasure is."
"204987124-0-43225";"""Vantus"" and I have unfinished business."
"204987124-0-43229";"It does?"
"204987124-0-43230";"I prefer a good white wine."
"204987124-0-43231";"That sounds like an excuse."
"204987124-0-43232";"I'm sure. Let's head to the temple."
"204987124-0-43237";"You were desperate. You made a mistake. But only <<1>> can forgive you."
"204987124-0-43239";"Mammoth cheese, imported from Skyrim."
"204987124-0-43245";"Before I decide what to do with you, I have some questions."
"204987124-0-43246";"If you tell me where to find <<1>>, I'll get you some wine."
"204987124-0-43253";"That seems like a pretty distant relation."
"204987124-0-43255";"Tell me about these letters."
"204987124-0-43256";"We should get moving. We're heading to <<c:1>>."
"204987124-0-43258";"I hear you need teeth to chew that food. Tell me or lose a few."
"204987124-0-43260";"Where can I find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43263";"Sour?"
"204987124-0-43264";"Agreed. Now, about <<1>> …."
"204987124-0-43266";"Who are you trying to find again?"
"204987124-0-43267";"Before we go, I have some questions about <<c:1>>."
"204987124-0-43268";"I know where to find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43270";"When does it start?"
"204987124-0-43272";"Your future husband did that. He framed the Thieves Guild."
"204987124-0-43273";"He used your dowry to become a merchant lord. Before that, he led the Thieves Guild."
"204987124-0-43274";"He's not <<1>>. His name is <<2>>, and we can prove he was behind the tomb robbery."
"204987124-0-43277";"Do what you need to do."
"204987124-0-43281";"What about <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43283";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43287";"The Danobia coins were definitely from the tomb. And you said that disguise kit belonged to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43288";"Any theories about what this <<1>> wants with <<2>>'s warehouse?"
"204987124-0-43290";"What exactly was your ""distraction?"""
"204987124-0-43291";"I am <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43292";"And that's what you Twilight Cantors do? You sing?"
"204987124-0-43293";"How could humming a song be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-43294";"How could singing a song be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-43295";"Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-43296";"If that's the case, why are you here?"
"204987124-0-43298";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-43300";"Because of the dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-43301";"Keep talking, and your skull will be flat as a book."
"204987124-0-43303";"What's Captain Apinia doing in these ruins?"
"204987124-0-43304";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-43306";"All right, I'll look for <<1>>."
"204987124-0-43310";"Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-43316";"What happened to you after Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-43317";"Who's Coris the mage?"
"204987124-0-43318";"What about Rivenspire? Is everything all right?"
"204987124-0-43319";"What happened to you after Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-43323";"What was your caravan carrying?"
"204987124-0-43324";"I'll help you recover the supplies."
"204987124-0-43325";"Eating an ogre seems like cannibalism."
"204987124-0-43326";"How does that concern the House of Orsimer Glories?"
"204987124-0-43328";"I'll recover <<Cz:1>>."
"204987124-0-43333";"You want to steal something from your childhood friend?"
"204987124-0-43339";"What happened to your Argonian family?"
"204987124-0-43340";"So it's been a while since you've seen your friend?"
"204987124-0-43342";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-43343";"What does this have to do with the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43344";"Could the Iron Wheel have seen the same notice?"
"204987124-0-43345";"Does anyone in the Thieves Guild know where your father is?"
"204987124-0-43346";"We're done. <<1>>, give him a lockpick."
"204987124-0-43348";"We're done."
"204987124-0-43349";"Count me in."
"204987124-0-43350";"If you feel this way, why were you looking for him?"
"204987124-0-43351";"Walks-Softly isn't property and he's certainly not staying here. He wants you to forget about him."
"204987124-0-43353";"Does anyone in the Thieves Guild know where your father is?"
"204987124-0-43355";"I think you were her slave."
"204987124-0-43356";"Did we really accomplish anything by stealing those keepsakes?"
"204987124-0-43358";"You think Anais will make good on her threat to track you down?"
"204987124-0-43361";"Why would we do that?"
"204987124-0-43370";"<<1>>, what are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-43374";"He's dead."
"204987124-0-43375";"Are you all right with how I handled <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43376";"Are you all right with how I handled <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43377";"Are you all right with how I handled <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43378";"He's wanted for stealing the dowry of <<1>>. Also, attempting to blackmail her into marriage."
"204987124-0-43380";"You don't have to. I have his wanted poster. Here, see for yourself."
"204987124-0-43381";"Protect yourself. Keep him as far away from your money as you can."
"204987124-0-43385";"Are you certain <<1>> betrayed the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-43387";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-43389";"Do you mean this whistle?"
"204987124-0-43390";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43391";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43392";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43393";"It's your amulet. Why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-43394";"Tell me more about this letter you received."
"204987124-0-43395";"What's a stargazer peony?"
"204987124-0-43396";"You must have some notion of what this is all about."
"204987124-0-43397";"You want me to find out who sent the letter and why?"
"204987124-0-43398";"You didn't see the person who slipped you the letter?"
"204987124-0-43399";"It's important to someone, just tell me."
"204987124-0-43403";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-43405";"What's a stargazer peony?"
"204987124-0-43406";"Tell me about this Abbot Kulan-dro."
"204987124-0-43407";"Tell me more about the Enclave of the Hourglass."
"204987124-0-43409";"Tell me about this Abbot Kulan-dro."
"204987124-0-43411";"Why do you need my help with this?"
"204987124-0-43414";"Tell me more about your target."
"204987124-0-43415";"What did he do to deserve death?"
"204987124-0-43416";"You're scrubbing the floor out of friendship?"
"204987124-0-43417";"Why do you need my help with this?"
"204987124-0-43419";"She punishes you?"
"204987124-0-43421";"How can you put up with that kind of treatment?"
"204987124-0-43423";"Why send a letter? You should have just gone to see her."
"204987124-0-43425";"Tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-43426";"I think you should go and talk to her."
"204987124-0-43427";"She didn't come here because she was afraid the letter was a trap."
"204987124-0-43428";"Why send a letter? You should have just gone to see her."
"204987124-0-43429";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43430";"Why didn't you absorb the spirits?"
"204987124-0-43431";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43432";"How many spirits do I need to catch?"
"204987124-0-43433";"Who is this seller?"
"204987124-0-43434";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43435";"Any way to earn a bonus for a job well done?"
"204987124-0-43436";"What do we do with the goods if they leave?"
"204987124-0-43437";"Who is this seller?"
"204987124-0-43438";"How hidden are these things?"
"204987124-0-43439";"She sent a letter to a friend. The friend wants to reconnect."
"204987124-0-43440";"Did anyone see you leave the castle?"
"204987124-0-43442";"So what's next for Naryu Virian?"
"204987124-0-43443";"How long has she been working here?"
"204987124-0-43444";"Can you at least tell me her name?"
"204987124-0-43445";"How long has she been working here?"
"204987124-0-43448";"What are you holding?"
"204987124-0-43451";"You can tell me."
"204987124-0-43452";"I'm a ""star pupil?"""
"204987124-0-43453";"You don't know that."
"204987124-0-43455";"Not really. But we can talk about it later."
"204987124-0-43456";"It's all right. I'll see you later."
"204987124-0-43460";"Before, you told me to always know what I was getting into."
"204987124-0-43465";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-43467";"A loud crash? What happened?"
"204987124-0-43470";"Once we've dealt with the overseer, what next?"
"204987124-0-43471";"<<Cz:1>>? What's a <<z:1>>?"
"204987124-0-43472";"<<1>> can get you there safely."
"204987124-0-43473";"I kept your belly full. Now, tell me what you know."
"204987124-0-43474";"Tell me what you know. I'll know if you're lying."
"204987124-0-43475";"Go ahead, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43480";"How did the dowry heist fail?"
"204987124-0-43481";"Why isn't <<1>> a friend of the Iron Wheel?"
"204987124-0-43482";"What do you know of <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43485";"Good to know. So what's the plan?"
"204987124-0-43487";"Why is <<1>> your least favorite person?"
"204987124-0-43489";"Who is the ""Desert Falcon?"" Why the interest in <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43491";"If I do find <<1>>, what should I do with him?"
"204987124-0-43492";"If <<1>> lives, are you asking me to murder him?"
"204987124-0-43495";"I'll lead you through the secret passage."
"204987124-0-43499";"You weren't an easy person to get along with, that's for sure."
"204987124-0-43501";"You both have a lot of catching up to do."
"204987124-0-43502";"She wants you to come to <<Ac:1>>. The Iron Wheel plans to arrest you. Here, we found this message."
"204987124-0-43503";"Is Tashmin in some sort of trouble?"
"204987124-0-43504";"Spiders? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43505";"You said you were from the Thieves Guild. What is that?"
"204987124-0-43506";"Can I read the letter you received?"
"204987124-0-43507";"I'll try to find him for you."
"204987124-0-43510";"First, tell me what's inside the warehouse."
"204987124-0-43511";"What if I don't want to go to Abah's Landing?"
"204987124-0-43514";"All right. Take us to Abah's Landing."
"204987124-0-43515";"Is Tashmin in some sort of trouble?"
"204987124-0-43516";"I'll try to find him for you."
"204987124-0-43518";"Can I read the letter you received?"
"204987124-0-43520";"Is Tashmin in some sort of trouble?"
"204987124-0-43521";"I'll try to find him for you."
"204987124-0-43522";"Can I read the letter you received?"
"204987124-0-43523";"I'm here to help. I heard he was in trouble."
"204987124-0-43525";"You want me to cover your debt?"
"204987124-0-43527";"I can't have you warning the Iron Wheel."
"204987124-0-43528";"Where did they take Tashmin?"
"204987124-0-43529";"All right. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43532";"I'm here to help him. His mother sent me."
"204987124-0-43533";"I'll get the arrest writ and then free you."
"204987124-0-43535";"I'm not a slaver."
"204987124-0-43537";"I'll get the arrest writ and then free you."
"204987124-0-43538";"Narahni wants to see you. She looked everywhere to find you."
"204987124-0-43540";"Narahni wants to see you. She looked everywhere to find you."
"204987124-0-43541";"Why are you and your mother estranged?"
"204987124-0-43544";"Now she has you both back in her life."
"204987124-0-43546";"Are you all right sharing Narahni with Tashmin?"
"204987124-0-43547";"Why are you surprised I took the job?"
"204987124-0-43549";"Is this the biggest job you've ever pulled off?"
"204987124-0-43555";"Hear what?"
"204987124-0-43561";"I'm ready to find the ledger."
"204987124-0-43563";"How poorly?"
"204987124-0-43568";"All right, I'm listening."
"204987124-0-43569";"Velsa said you could help me locate some big scores."
"204987124-0-43571";"See you there."
"204987124-0-43572";"I'm ready for my first heist."
"204987124-0-43573";"I'm ready for my first heist."
"204987124-0-43574";"I'm ready for my first heist."
"204987124-0-43577";"I'll find <<1>>. We should bring him with us."
"204987124-0-43578";"I'm ready if you are."
"204987124-0-43580";"Thanks for the help."
"204987124-0-43591";"Why is the Iron Wheel after the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-43592";"So you kidnapped her and demanded a ransom?"
"204987124-0-43593";"Then what are you planning to do with her?"
"204987124-0-43594";"Time? Time to do what?"
"204987124-0-43596";"All right, I'll plant these letters in the Velmont Mansion."
"204987124-0-43605";"You have to make things right. We need to get her out of here and set her free."
"204987124-0-43606";"What would Anais do if she was in your position?"
"204987124-0-43609";"Leave her here and teach her a lesson."
"204987124-0-43611";"What would Anais do if she was in your position?"
"204987124-0-43612";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-43615";"What happened to the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-43616";"What can you tell me about your guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-43617";"What happened to the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-43618";"What happened to the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-43619";"What did you do during the guild crisis?"
"204987124-0-43620";"What did you do during the guild crisis?"
"204987124-0-43621";"The disguise?"
"204987124-0-43622";"The disguise?"
"204987124-0-43623";"I found this key on a pirate."
"204987124-0-43624";"What sort of danger?"
"204987124-0-43625";"What sort of danger?"
"204987124-0-43627";"I will try to find him and bring him back here."
"204987124-0-43629";"I will try to find him and bring him back here."
"204987124-0-43631";"I'm going to try to pick the lock."
"204987124-0-43632";"Is there a particular pirate who might have the key?"
"204987124-0-43633";"What's the deal with Velsa?"
"204987124-0-43634";"I'm here to help. I heard he was in trouble."
"204987124-0-43636";"You want me to cover your debt?"
"204987124-0-43637";"Does the Thieves Guild really need muscle?"
"204987124-0-43638";"What's the deal with Velsa?"
"204987124-0-43639";"I'm here to help. I heard he was in trouble."
"204987124-0-43641";"You want me to cover your debt?"
"204987124-0-43642";"Do you consider Zeira to be a good guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-43643";"Do any interesting jobs lately?"
"204987124-0-43644";"Do you consider Zeira to be a good guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-43645";"You're rather cynical."
"204987124-0-43646";"You're rather cynical."
"204987124-0-43647";"Pick up any interesting loot lately?"
"204987124-0-43648";"Can't you make an educated guess?"
"204987124-0-43649";"What's the Thazahrr Cartel?"
"204987124-0-43650";"I'd love to hear your most-educated guess concerning the stolen dowry."
"204987124-0-43652";"So you're actually a spy?"
"204987124-0-43653";"So you're actually a spy?"
"204987124-0-43654";"Does Zeira trust you with the guild's finances?"
"204987124-0-43655";"I thought Thrag was in charge of security for the guild."

"204987124-0-43801";"Chanter Nemus told you all this? He knows about you and the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-43802";"We're a family, Hilde. We protect each other. We're stronger together."
"204987124-0-43803";"Chanter Nemus deceived you. He sent the Silver Dawn to kill you."
"204987124-0-43804";"I think we should get back to the Gold Coast."
"204987124-0-43806";"Let's get back to the Gold Coast."

"204987124-0-43813";"The notice mentioned not to disturb the security."
"204987124-0-43814";"Point taken. Let's get to the heist."
"204987124-0-43815";"[Lie] One of her cousins plans to usurp her. But drink loosens his lips, and he's prone to brag."
"204987124-0-43816";"Is there another way inside?"
"204987124-0-43817";"All right. I'll get us inside."
"204987124-0-43818";"All right. I'll get us inside."
"204987124-0-43819";"And until then?"

"204987124-0-43822";"Did you ever have feelings for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43825";"[Lie] Never mind, I was only joking."
"204987124-0-43827";"Never mind, I was only joking."
"204987124-0-43828";"I'll try not to get tripped up. Let's get on with the heist then."
"204987124-0-43830";"Can you lead me through?"
"204987124-0-43833";"Who's Shazara-Ta?"
"204987124-0-43834";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-43835";"But what happened after that? And what's the connection between Lyra and the Black Dragon?"
"204987124-0-43836";"But why is Lyra working for the Order of the Hour now?"
"204987124-0-43837";"What kind of sickness?"
"204987124-0-43838";"And they take slaves to help?"
"204987124-0-43839";"Why?"
"204987124-0-43840";"Is this your first adventure?"
"204987124-0-43841";"So, what's your story?"
"204987124-0-43842";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43843";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43844";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43846";"We're in disguise. Why can't we walk through the front door?"
"204987124-0-43847";"Who would know <<1>>'s whereabouts?"
"204987124-0-43848";"You're the only one who isn't hunted by the Iron Wheel."
"204987124-0-43850";"Never mind. I'll ask someone else."
"204987124-0-43851";"We should get moving."
"204987124-0-43852";"We should get moving."
"204987124-0-43853";"We should get moving."
"204987124-0-43855";"Sounds like you had to do some heavy lifting."
"204987124-0-43857";"Then I guess that's our way inside."
"204987124-0-43858";"What is this place exactly?"
"204987124-0-43859";"This might be more dangerous than you think."
"204987124-0-43860";"Do the Xit-Xaht have a leader?"
"204987124-0-43862";"Never mind. I'll ask someone else."

"204987124-0-43875";"We should get going."
"204987124-0-43876";"We should get going."
"204987124-0-43877";"The lighthouse?"

"204987124-0-43886";"Is there anything else we need to do, Speaker?"
"204987124-0-43888";"There's more than one of these creatures in the cave?"
"204987124-0-43889";"Can you tell me anything that will help me defeat Exulus?"
"204987124-0-43890";"Your bounty didn't mention three of these things."
"204987124-0-43891";"Who is Exulus?"
"204987124-0-43892";"All right. What of the half-map? <<1>> said <<2>> used those."
"204987124-0-43895";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-43896";"I don't understand why the Iron Wheel thinks we stole the dowry."
"204987124-0-43897";"But why is the Iron Wheel so concerned about a dowry?"
"204987124-0-43898";"Tell me what you know about the dowry heist."

"204987124-0-43926";"How can I get one of those scrolls?"
"204987124-0-43927";"I'm already on a contract for Governor Fortunata."
"204987124-0-43929";"Governor Fortunata won't survive the day."
"204987124-0-43931";"That's it? I don't have to sign anything?"
"204987124-0-43933";"Your name sounds familiar. Any relation to Fortunata ap Dugal?"

"204987124-0-43952";"I don't care what you think."
"204987124-0-43953";"So, getting beaten up was part of the plan?"
"204987124-0-43955";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-43958";"Really?"
"204987124-0-43961";"Who is the ""Desert Falcon?"" Why the interest in <<1>>?"

"204987124-0-43968";"Where did ""Volu"" call home?"
"204987124-0-43971";"You don't get to have a happy family. Your wife should know who you really are."
"204987124-0-43972";"What was your plan?"
"204987124-0-43975";"Isn't this a strange location for a mill?"
"204987124-0-43977";"You were part of Varen's rebellion?"
"204987124-0-43978";"You're mistaken. I'm not Emperor Varen."
"204987124-0-43980";"You are a sad, strange woman. Farewell."
"204987124-0-43983";"Can you travel?"
"204987124-0-43985";"Sounds good. Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-43987";"I'm not setting foot into the darkness until you tell me what to expect."
"204987124-0-43989";"What about the path?"
"204987124-0-43991";"All right. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-43992";"You marked the Windhelm docks on my map. Why Eastmarch? Why not leave directly from here?"
"204987124-0-43993";"Where are we headed, exactly?"
"204987124-0-43994";"Where are we headed, exactly?"

"204987124-0-43997";"How well do you know the life of a thief?"
"204987124-0-43998";"Any objections if I steal more than just the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-43999";"First tell me who are you and what's going on."
"204987124-0-44002";"<<1>> blamed you for what happened in Malooc's Path."

"204987124-0-44034";"You mentioned unpleasant history with the captain of the Dreamsnake?"
"204987124-0-44036";"Couldn't you make me an Iron Wheel uniform?"
"204987124-0-44037";"Why won't a servant's disguise work inside the Iron Wheel headquarters?"
"204987124-0-44038";"<<1>>, what are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-44040";"Then you should drink the whole bottle."
"204987124-0-44041";"You said the dowry heist failed. But <<1>> said it's missing. Who else knew about the heist?"
"204987124-0-44042";"What is <<1>> planning?"
"204987124-0-44043";"You said the dowry heist failed. But <<1>> said it's missing. Who else knew about the heist?"
"204987124-0-44045";"Are you certain you've never heard of ""<<1>>?"""
"204987124-0-44046";"Are you certain you've never heard of ""<<1>>?"""
"204987124-0-44047";"Has <<1>> always been … like that?"
"204987124-0-44048";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-44049";"I don't understand why the Iron Wheel thinks we stole the dowry."
"204987124-0-44050";"Why is the Iron Wheel so concerned about a dowry?"
"204987124-0-44051";"Tell me what you know about the dowry heist."
"204987124-0-44052";"Before we left for <<c:1>>, <<2>> said you had been inside. Did you ever walk Malooc's Path?"
"204987124-0-44054";"What sort of business?"
"204987124-0-44055";"All right. Let's do it."
"204987124-0-44056";"Does Abah's Landing really have merchant lords?"
"204987124-0-44057";"Were you on the path? I thought you were holding the panel."
"204987124-0-44059";"You said something about purification?"
"204987124-0-44060";"Does Astara know we're going to do this?"
"204987124-0-44061";"You said something about purification?"
"204987124-0-44065";"So how do we find this missing piece of the puzzle?"
"204987124-0-44069";"What can we expect to find?"
"204987124-0-44071";"What can we expect to find?"
"204987124-0-44072";"Why do you want to steal the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-44074";"I'll give it to her."
"204987124-0-44075";"All right. Tell me where to find her."
"204987124-0-44076";"You mentioned traps. What kind of traps?"
"204987124-0-44077";"Then let's do this."
"204987124-0-44078";"Wasn't this Sanctuary abandoned?"
"204987124-0-44080";"What should we do about it?"
"204987124-0-44081";"Don't blame <<1>>. It was my choice to infiltrate the Iron Wheel's headquarters."
"204987124-0-44082";"<<1>> met with the Iron Wheel. He promised to recover <<2>>'s dowry."
"204987124-0-44083";"<<1>> met with the Iron Wheel. He promised to recover <<2>>'s dowry."
"204987124-0-44084";"<<1>> met with the Iron Wheel. He promised to recover <<2>>'s dowry."
"204987124-0-44085";"All right. Where will <<1>> greet his guests?"
"204987124-0-44086";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-44087";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-44088";"What do you think about Zeira?"
"204987124-0-44090";"What about Velsa? You must have an opinion about her."
"204987124-0-44091";"What do you think about Walks-Softly?"
"204987124-0-44092";"What do you think about Walks-Softly?"
"204987124-0-44093";"What can we expect to find?"
"204987124-0-44096";"What do you think about going back?"
"204987124-0-44097";"What can we expect to find?"
"204987124-0-44099";"When were you inside <<c:1>>?"
"204987124-0-44100";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44101";"Were you in love with someone else?"
"204987124-0-44102";"What do you think about Walks-Softly?"
"204987124-0-44103";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44104";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44105";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44106";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-44107";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-44108";"How did you manage to remove the dye from your clothes?"
"204987124-0-44109";"Did you forgive her?"
"204987124-0-44110";"What do you think about Zeira?"
"204987124-0-44111";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44112";"What do you think about Quen?"

"204987124-0-44115";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44116";"What do you think about Quen?"
"204987124-0-44117";"If <<1>> did steal the dowry, why would he leave this here?"
"204987124-0-44118";"I'll meet you at <<c:1>>."
"204987124-0-44119";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-44120";"So what does Falorah get out of it?"
"204987124-0-44121";"Then tell me, how does <<1>> gain from the wedding?"
"204987124-0-44122";"How does <<1>> gain from the wedding?"
"204987124-0-44123";"Why would <<1>> marry <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-44124";"All right. Tell me what you need."
"204987124-0-44126";"Was it an amulet?"
"204987124-0-44127";"No reason. Are the Iron Wheel still giving you trouble?"
"204987124-0-44128";"And that's how you became a werewolf?"
"204987124-0-44129";"I'll handle the Chanter. Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-44130";"And that's when Kor found you?"
"204987124-0-44131";"All right, I'll meet you when I'm done."
"204987124-0-44132";"Good luck, <<1>>."
"204987124-0-44134";"What did you do during the guild crisis?"
"204987124-0-44141";"But were you able to extract the Dwarven maps from the orb?"
"204987124-0-44144";"Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-44145";"That sounds like an excuse."
"204987124-0-44146";"You were desperate. You made a mistake. But only <<1>> can forgive you."
"204987124-0-44151";"Why don't you stay here. The Dark Brotherhood could use someone like you."
"204987124-0-44154";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-44155";"Then why are you chasing a war criminal?"
"204987124-0-44156";"Tell me about the items that were stolen."
"204987124-0-44157";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-44158";"Did Queen Ayrenn send you to the Gold Coast?"
"204987124-0-44159";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-44161";"But why betray the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-44162";"You're saying this is <<1>>'s fault?"
"204987124-0-44163";"But that's not what happened. It's time I decided what to do with you."
"204987124-0-44165";"Fortunata sent me, but not to kill you. Marcus Scipio is dead. She wanted you to know."
"204987124-0-44168";"That's not the way it works."
"204987124-0-44175";"Very well, let's go see the Grand Chanter."
"204987124-0-44176";"Oh, very well. Let's go see the Grand Chanter."
"204987124-0-44177";"What's Knightsgrave?"
"204987124-0-44178";"What do you think they're planning?"
"204987124-0-44179";"Understood. I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-44187";"How will me getting detained help convince your sister to leave the Society of the Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44188";"How will me getting detained convince your sister to leave the Society of the Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44189";"It's some kind of prayer or ritual, maybe. Very poetic."
"204987124-0-44190";"It's a chant. Descriptions of people, like riddles, ending with ""you will know them by their eye."""
"204987124-0-44192";"Why do you think they're targets?"
"204987124-0-44193";"Why didn't the Speaker just tell me who to assassinate?"
"204987124-0-44194";"From beyond death's prison, I offer those who meet my unshriven gaze with your blade's cold caress."
"204987124-0-44195";"What if I kill the wrong person?"
"204987124-0-44197";"What if I kill the wrong person?"
"204987124-0-44203";"Understood. I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-44205";"For now."
"204987124-0-44206";"How did you get drawn into the Grand Chanter's cult?"
"204987124-0-44213";"Jubilee Cake?"
"204987124-0-44214";"So how do I redeem my voucher?"
"204987124-0-44215";"So how do I redeem my voucher?"
"204987124-0-44216";"So how do I redeem my voucher?"
"204987124-0-44226";"If you say so …."
"204987124-0-44229";"What happens if I get spotted making a kill?"
"204987124-0-44230";"This had better not be a trick."
"204987124-0-44232";"I need to get into the castle. Give me your seal or become a permanent resident of this graveyard."
"204987124-0-44233";"Qamar sent me to make a withdrawal, but I can tell him you're too busy to help."
"204987124-0-44235";"Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-44241";"There are secret passages in the castle?"
"204987124-0-44242";"Is poison really the best option for this kill?"
"204987124-0-44243";"Since you know so much, why don't you just handle this contract?"
"204987124-0-44244";"How do I reach the Governor's private pantry?"
"204987124-0-44245";"Will Qamar help you grow that dwindling pile of winnings? What's he really worth to you?"
"204987124-0-44249";"You have a secret escape route?"
"204987124-0-44250";"What's the Black Sacrament?"
"204987124-0-44251";"Thanks for the tip."
"204987124-0-44252";"You think something may have happened to Hildegard?"
"204987124-0-44253";"What's the deal with you and Hildegard?"
"204987124-0-44254";"Hard to believe the Brotherhood tolerates a werewolf in its midst."
"204987124-0-44255";"You think something may have happened to Hildegard?"
"204987124-0-44256";"You think something may have happened to Hildegard?"
"204987124-0-44257";"How did you end up working for the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-44258";"You have a sister?"
"204987124-0-44259";"You have access to all the guild's finances?"
"204987124-0-44260";"You have access to all the guild's finances?"
"204987124-0-44266";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44267";"I'll go and speak to the Count now."
"204987124-0-44268";"Thanks for the information, Sister."
"204987124-0-44269";"The Black Dragon was sighted near the ruins where I'm supposed to meet the Count."
"204987124-0-44270";"I agree."
"204987124-0-44271";"Yes. Mirabelle has been tracking the Black Dragon."
"204987124-0-44274";"I'll go meet with the Count now."
"204987124-0-44275";"Can you tell me more about Governor Fortunata?"
"204987124-0-44279";"Anything I need to know about Anvil Castle?"
"204987124-0-44280";"How did a pirate queen become the governor of Anvil?"
"204987124-0-44281";"Mirabelle spies on Governor Fortunata?"
"204987124-0-44282";"Can you tell me more about Governor Fortunata?"
"204987124-0-44283";"You allowed militant priests to have free run of Kvatch?"
"204987124-0-44284";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44285";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44286";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44287";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44289";"What are the biggest threats to the guild?"
"204987124-0-44290";"I want to know more about the guild in general."
"204987124-0-44291";"Do you have any work for me?"
"204987124-0-44292";"Any tips on where to collect Gold Coast ledgers?"
"204987124-0-44293";"What's really going on here?"
"204987124-0-44295";"What has you in such a hurry then?"
"204987124-0-44296";"I can go to Kvatch."
"204987124-0-44298";"I'll go to Kvatch right away,"
"204987124-0-44299";"What do you mean, emotional?"
"204987124-0-44300";"Where does Hildegard usually go to pray?"
"204987124-0-44302";"I'll help you find Hildegard."
"204987124-0-44303";"Was Mirabelle close to Cimbar?"
"204987124-0-44304";"What do you mean, emotional?"
"204987124-0-44305";"Who's the client I'm supposed to meet?"
"204987124-0-44306";"Any idea who the Provincial Governor wants dead?"
"204987124-0-44314";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-44315";"I'll accompany you to your former Sanctuary."
"204987124-0-44316";"Where is your former Sanctuary, by the way?"
"204987124-0-44318";"I'll take care of the Chanter. Go home, Hildegard."
"204987124-0-44320";"One of them? You thought I was one of the Dark Brotherhood, didn't you?"
"204987124-0-44321";"How do you plan to get the attention of a secret group of assassins?"
"204987124-0-44322";"You want me to just go up and kill a random person in cold blood?"
"204987124-0-44323";"I don't know. It sounds kind of risky."
"204987124-0-44324";"Why weren't you killed in the purification?"
"204987124-0-44325";"Why would the Black Dragon use your friend's name?"
"204987124-0-44326";"You said something about purification?"
"204987124-0-44327";"I'll make sure she's here for work."
"204987124-0-44329";"I'll let Raynor know what you expect of him."
"204987124-0-44331";"The same Sanctuary that she was ordered to purify?"
"204987124-0-44332";"Didn't Artorius use us to eliminate his predecessor?"
"204987124-0-44333";"What have we learned about the Black Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44334";"Why would the Black Dragon go to a place like that?"
"204987124-0-44335";"Tell me about Knightsgrave."
"204987124-0-44336";"What have we learned about the Black Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44337";"Is there actually something about me in that book?"
"204987124-0-44338";"Anyway, it's nice to meet you."
"204987124-0-44339";"I'd like to know a bit more about you."
"204987124-0-44340";"I … see. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-44341";"I'd like to know a bit more about you."
"204987124-0-44342";"What makes you think the murders are connected?"
"204987124-0-44343";"Have you shared your suspicions with the Matron?"
"204987124-0-44344";"Anything else you want to tell me about the Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-44346";"Is that how Hildegard became a werewolf?"
"204987124-0-44347";"Looks like you survived."
"204987124-0-44348";"Hildegard sounds like an interesting person. What's her story?"
"204987124-0-44349";"You're lucky she didn't attack you."
"204987124-0-44350";"Tell me more about yourself, Kor."
"204987124-0-44351";"Tell me about yourself, Kor."
"204987124-0-44353";"Artorius actually performed the Black Sacrament?"
"204987124-0-44354";"How can we fight the Order of the Hour? They're an army!"
"204987124-0-44355";"Artorius actually performed the Black Sacrament?"
"204987124-0-44356";"Artorius actually performed the Black Sacrament?"
"204987124-0-44357";"So you killed her to avoid embarrassment?"
"204987124-0-44358";"Earlier you called yourself a Speaker?"
"204987124-0-44359";"Why does he want to meet at the ruins?"
"204987124-0-44361";"I'll talk to Mirabelle before I head out."
"204987124-0-44362";"Primate Artorius knows the location of the Sanctuary. Brema revealed it before she died."
"204987124-0-44364";"Do you really think the Order of the Hour will attack the Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-44365";"How can I serve, Matron?"
"204987124-0-44367";"If Green-Venom-Tongue doesn't kill Lyra, I will."
"204987124-0-44368";"I think you need to explain this to me."
"204987124-0-44369";"How does the killer announce his intentions?"
"204987124-0-44370";"I'll talk to them and see what I can find out."
"204987124-0-44372";"You're rather open and nonchalant about all this."
"204987124-0-44373";"You're wrong. And possibly insane."
"204987124-0-44374";"You've read a book about the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-44375";"How did you find out about this killer and his sweetrolls?"
"204987124-0-44376";"So you want me to just walk up and kill a random person in cold blood?"
"204987124-0-44377";"What are the benefits of joining a group like that?"
"204987124-0-44378";"How do you know so much about a secret organization of assassins?"
"204987124-0-44379";"How do you know so much about a secret organization of assassins?"
"204987124-0-44380";"So the sweetrolls are poisonous?"
"204987124-0-44381";"But why do you think the Dark Brotherhood is looking for recruits?"
"204987124-0-44382";"A mysterious visit?"
"204987124-0-44383";"So you want me to just walk up and kill a random person in cold blood?"
"204987124-0-44384";"Why not go to the Kvatch Guard or the Order of the Hour about this?"
"204987124-0-44385";"You mentioned that some of the people on the list are associates of yours?"
"204987124-0-44386";"What did you say?"
"204987124-0-44387";"You mentioned that some of the people on the list are associates of yours?"
"204987124-0-44389";"And then?"
"204987124-0-44391";"I think you've been targeted by the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-0-44395";"You should continue to wander the market. Stay near other people."
"204987124-0-44398";"I think you've been targeted by the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-0-44400";"You're not worried?"
"204987124-0-44401";"Did you know any of the killer's other victims?"
"204987124-0-44403";"You should keep doing what you're doing, remaining in plain view."
"204987124-0-44404";"So you're just going to do the exact same thing?"
"204987124-0-44409";"I was asked to look into the sweetroll murders."
"204987124-0-44410";"You know Reman?"
"204987124-0-44411";"There wasn't a body?"
"204987124-0-44412";"Tell me about your husband."
"204987124-0-44413";"I appreciate the warning."
"204987124-0-44418";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44419";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44420";"How many people did you kill, exactly?"
"204987124-0-44421";"You murdered thirteen people just to get the attention of the Speaker?"
"204987124-0-44422";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44424";"You are absolutely insane."
"204987124-0-44425";"Good. This is obedient duty, not murderous playtime."
"204987124-0-44426";"I'm just trying to help."
"204987124-0-44427";"Did you receive a sweetroll with a note inside it or not?"
"204987124-0-44430";"Wait, hold on."
"204987124-0-44431";"Why are you getting so upset about a few simple questions?"
"204987124-0-44432";"And what matter is that?"
"204987124-0-44433";"All of us? Artorius is just one man."
"204987124-0-44435";"Artorius will die."
"204987124-0-44436";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-44437";"Where should I meet you?"
"204987124-0-44438";"Where do you want to meet?"
"204987124-0-44440";"You think it's the same murderer?"
"204987124-0-44442";"Just one?"
"204987124-0-44443";"What about your apprentice?"
"204987124-0-44444";"So what's your plan?"
"204987124-0-44445";"What do you think of the Wolf and Eternal Knight clues?"
"204987124-0-44448";"That does sound lucrative."
"204987124-0-44450";"I'll go meet Fa'ren-dar."
"204987124-0-44451";"What do you think about the Perch clue?"
"204987124-0-44452";"What do you think of the Wolf and Eternal Knight clues?"
"204987124-0-44453";"What do you think of the Wolf and Eternal Knight clues?"
"204987124-0-44454";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44456";"I just want to know who I'll be working with."
"204987124-0-44457";"I'd like to know more about the contract."
"204987124-0-44458";"We're looking for the Sweetroll Killer. I didn't even know you were still in town."
"204987124-0-44459";"Then Anvil is where we're going, too."
"204987124-0-44460";"Find out anything that can help us? We're on the same side here."
"204987124-0-44461";"Shouldn't we let her know where we're going?"
"204987124-0-44462";"Where is your former Sanctuary, exactly?"
"204987124-0-44463";"Why do you need my help with this?"
"204987124-0-44464";"Who is this Governor you keep mentioning?"
"204987124-0-44465";"I want to face your best gladiator in the arena."
"204987124-0-44466";"I'd like to know more about what you encountered."
"204987124-0-44470";"Good idea. If she can't handle a weapon, she shouldn't have one."
"204987124-0-44471";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-44474";"The Sweetroll Killer works for you?"
"204987124-0-44476";"Tell me who the killer is and where I can find her!"
"204987124-0-44477";"No, Reman's not the killer. Not exactly. It's Louna."
"204987124-0-44479";"What about the people here in the hostel?"
"204987124-0-44483";"You're saying that your victims were so evil they had to die?"
"204987124-0-44489";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-44492";"Do you know Reman Mevavius?"
"204987124-0-44494";"It sounds like the Black Dragon serves Primate Artorius."
"204987124-0-44497";"Reman?"
"204987124-0-44498";"What does you being here have to do with Darien Gautier?"
"204987124-0-44499";"You think Darien's lost in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-44500";"Do you have any ideas?"
"204987124-0-44501";"Are you here on behalf of the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-44502";"I hope you find him, Gabrielle."
"204987124-0-44503";"Do you plan to be here long?"
"204987124-0-44504";"What exactly are you researching?"
"204987124-0-44508";"The note mentioned The Colored Rooms. I think Darien was calling for help."
"204987124-0-44509";"I'm glad. So are you here on behalf of the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-44510";"Why should I let you go free?"
"204987124-0-44511";"The trader, the baker, the Eye's apprentice. But what about Naryu?"
"204987124-0-44513";"What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-44514";"<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>"
"204987124-0-44515";"<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>"

"204987124-0-44518";"<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>"
"204987124-0-44519";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-44521";"Do you think we can trust her?"
"204987124-0-44523";"What about the people she targeted?"
"204987124-0-44525";"I agree with Raz. Give us the antidote and you get to live."
"204987124-0-44526";"We don't want to see you around here again."
"204987124-0-44527";"<Kill Louna.>"
"204987124-0-44530";"I understand."
"204987124-0-44531";"What is your second challenge?"
"204987124-0-44532";"<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>"
"204987124-0-44533";"<<1>> will die. <Teleport now.>"
"204987124-0-44535";"That's a problem for another day, I imagine."
"204987124-0-44536";"If the Fate-Bearers return, we'll just have to be ready."
"204987124-0-44539";"Where is home, exactly?"
"204987124-0-44540";"What about the Fate-Bearers?"
"204987124-0-44541";"Can't you stick around a little longer?"
"204987124-0-44547";"We don't want to see you around here again."
"204987124-0-44549";"<Kill Louna.>"
"204987124-0-44551";"Tell me more about this mission."
"204987124-0-44552";"Were Mirabelle and Cimbar close?"
"204987124-0-44555";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44557";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44558";"Your contract is paid in full."
"204987124-0-44559";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44560";"Any idea why a warrior of the Order would be murdering members of the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-44561";"Tell me more about the Enclave of the Hourglass."
"204987124-0-44563";"What did you mean, the Black Dragon is like me?"
"204987124-0-44564";"So you admit that you're the Black Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44565";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44566";"Any advice for me?"
"204987124-0-44567";"I wasn't traipsing."
"204987124-0-44568";"Thank you, Elam."
"204987124-0-44569";"Were you close?"
"204987124-0-44570";"It's true. She was once a part of the Dark Brotherhood."
"204987124-0-44571";"I sent her to Sithis, her fate is in the Dread Father's hands now."
"204987124-0-44572";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44574";"That's still pretty tall."
"204987124-0-44575";"Tell me about these elders."
"204987124-0-44576";"Who is this Xal-Nur?"
"204987124-0-44593";"So the Dark Brotherhood is a group of paid assassins."
"204987124-0-44594";"I also found the Black Dragon's journal."
"204987124-0-44595";"Where is your former Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-44597";"I was unable to complete the challenges."
"204987124-0-44629";"I was unable to complete the challenges."
"204987124-0-44662";"Anything else?"

"204987124-0-44735";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44755";"What sort of tool?"
"204987124-0-44757";"I accept your gift."
"204987124-0-44758";"I accept your gift."
"204987124-0-44759";"I just want to stop the Sweetroll Killer. Especially if you're a target."
"204987124-0-44760";"We're looking for the Sweetroll Killer. I didn't even know you were still in town."
"204987124-0-44763";"Has anyone else approached you about this job?"
"204987124-0-44764";"Did you know any of the killer's other victims?"
"204987124-0-44765";"Do you know anyone else who received a sweetroll?"
"204987124-0-44766";"I think you've been targeted by the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-0-44767";"So you could turn into a beast at any moment?"
"204987124-0-44769";"You don't seem like a typical assassin."
"204987124-0-44770";"Ever thought about seeking a cure?"
"204987124-0-44771";"So you could transform at any moment?"
"204987124-0-44775";"She's part of the family. Shouldn't we look out for each other?"
"204987124-0-44777";"So have I earned your trust?"
"204987124-0-44779";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-44780";"So I'll likely be heading back to Kvatch."
"204987124-0-44782";"Maybe Astara just doesn't want to take chances with this one."
"204987124-0-44784";"But weren't you and Cimbar close?"
"204987124-0-44787";"What kind of enemies?"
"204987124-0-44788";"I told Astara what you've been doing. I don't think she sent you here at all."
"204987124-0-44790";"Maybe it's personal."
"204987124-0-44791";"What exactly are you planning to do?"
"204987124-0-44792";"What exactly are you planning to do?"
"204987124-0-44793";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-44795";"I'll disrupt their preparations if I can."
"204987124-0-44796";"You're one of the Governor's handmaidens?"
"204987124-0-44798";"So you know Anvil Castle well?"
"204987124-0-44799";"He never told me about that."
"204987124-0-44801";"You want me to get rough?"
"204987124-0-44802";"Sacred blade?"
"204987124-0-44803";"Are you caught up with what's been going on around here?"
"204987124-0-44805";"Haunted?"
"204987124-0-44806";"Any advice on dealing with the Black Dragon?"
"204987124-0-44807";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-44808";"Know anything about the ruins Astara is sending me to?"
"204987124-0-44811";"What do you know about Knightsgrave?"
"204987124-0-44818";"And you don't have a problem with killing?"
"204987124-0-44819";"You seem nervous. Is everything all right?"
"204987124-0-44820";"By ripping them apart?"
"204987124-0-44821";"Is there anyone here you care about?"
"204987124-0-44823";"Sounds like there's a story there."
"204987124-0-44824";"Do you know something about Green-Venom-Tongue's former Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-44826";"Why would the Black Hand purify a Sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-44830";"What will you be doing while I'm dealing with the stash?"
"204987124-0-44831";"So the Gold Coast Trading Company is evil?"
"204987124-0-44832";"Who takes out our contracts?"
"204987124-0-44833";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44834";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44835";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44837";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44838";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44839";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-44840";"Who's the Listener?"
"204987124-0-44841";"Who's the Listener?"
"204987124-0-44842";"You said the pages of the book are blank?"
"204987124-0-44843";"We'd be punished for that failure?"
"204987124-0-44845";"You mean the Dark Brotherhood can refuse the request?"
"204987124-0-44846";"How does a petitioner get heard by the Night Mother?"
"204987124-0-44847";"Can the Dark Brotherhood refuse to accept the offering?"
"204987124-0-44848";"Could someone like Lyra ever be forgiven?"
"204987124-0-44850";"Understood. I'll continue to aid my Brothers and Sisters here."
"204987124-0-44852";"Who's Primate Artorius?"
"204987124-0-44853";"Do we really need to send two assassins to Kvatch?"
"204987124-0-44854";"Are you sure she's still in there?"
"204987124-0-44855";"But have you figured out where we need to go next?"
"204987124-0-44858";"Couldn't you go in after her?"
"204987124-0-44859";"Are you sure he's still in there?"
"204987124-0-44861";"Have you gone in to look for him?"
"204987124-0-44862";"Just tell me where we need to go."
"204987124-0-44865";"I'll disrupt their preparations if I can."
"204987124-0-44866";"I'll disrupt their preparations if I can."
"204987124-0-44867";"Anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-44869";"Is that worthy of reward?"
"204987124-0-44892";"If you haven't spoken to him, how did you hear about his mission here?"
"204987124-0-44893";"From birth?"
"204987124-0-44904";"Sounds like you didn't enjoy it."
"204987124-0-44905";"Do they have a leader?"
"204987124-0-44907";"Do you think she's here?"
"204987124-0-44908";"Tell me about Tsatva-Lan."
"204987124-0-44919";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44920";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44921";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44922";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44923";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44924";"Who is my target?"
"204987124-0-44925";"You don't seem too broken up."
"204987124-0-44927";"Don't forget our bargain."
"204987124-0-44929";"But you aren't in the legion anymore?"
"204987124-0-44931";"So you want a pumpkin and some guts. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-44933";"You're not a priestess, are you?"
"204987124-0-44935";"Glad to hear it."
"204987124-0-44936";"Why?"
"204987124-0-44938";"I see your point."
"204987124-0-44939";"What is the Silken Ring?"
"204987124-0-44940";"Tell me more about Tsatva-Lan."
"204987124-0-44941";"I need to know the situation. Tell me what's going on here."
"204987124-0-44942";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-44943";"I'll join you."
"204987124-0-44944";"The Celestials?"
"204987124-0-44948";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-44949";"I want to know more about the star signs."
"204987124-0-44950";"What about the thirteenth sign?"
"204987124-0-44951";"She seems to have a lot of authority for being new here."
"204987124-0-44952";"I want to know more about the star signs."
"204987124-0-44953";"What can you tell me about Hara?"
"204987124-0-44956";"Fine. Hold still and I'll undo the bonds."
"204987124-0-44957";"<Untie the binds.>"
"204987124-0-44959";"Tell me more about the Nedes."
"204987124-0-44960";"What's the connection between the Nedic priests and the Skystone amulet?"
"204987124-0-44961";"What can you tell me about Mtharnaz?"
"204987124-0-44962";"Tell me more about the Nedes."
"204987124-0-44963";"Fine. Hold still and I'll undo the bonds."
"204987124-0-44964";"How did Titus get here?"
"204987124-0-44966";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-44967";"What can you tell me about the Anka-Ra?"
"204987124-0-44968";"How does that help us?"
"204987124-0-44969";"Tell me more about the Nedes."
"204987124-0-44970";"So how do we reach the Warrior's Apex Stone?"
"204987124-0-44971";"I found the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"204987124-0-44972";"A man named Titus Valerius helped me defeat the leader of the Anka-Ra."
"204987124-0-44973";"A man named Titus Valerius helped me defeat the leader of the Anka-Ra."
"204987124-0-44974";"He said he was pulled across time."
"204987124-0-44975";"I found the Warrior's Apex Stone."
"204987124-0-44976";"You think the Mage is summoning atronachs?"
"204987124-0-44977";"How do we stop them?"
"204987124-0-44978";"Do you think there's any truth to the High Elf women's claims?"
"204987124-0-44979";"What can you tell me about the atronachs?"
"204987124-0-44980";"You mentioned other magical events."
"204987124-0-44981";"What do you mean, distracted?"
"204987124-0-44982";"You don't believe them?"
"204987124-0-44983";"Tell me about Elinhir."
"204987124-0-44984";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-44985";"What else can you tell me about Craglorn?"
"204987124-0-44986";"What else can you tell me about Craglorn?"
"204987124-0-44987";"She foresaw the current situation?"
"204987124-0-44988";"Tell me more about the Star-Gazers."
"204987124-0-44989";"Seems like an interesting coincidence."
"204987124-0-44990";"What can you tell me about Hara?"
"204987124-0-44991";"I thought it was your job to study these things."
"204987124-0-44992";"What can you tell me about Hara?"
"204987124-0-44993";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-44994";"Tell me what you know about the trials."
"204987124-0-44995";"What are the flame-bearers?"
"204987124-0-44996";"The founder of this school worshiped the Warrior?"
"204987124-0-44997";"Why would the Serpent want to attack Rahni'Za?"
"204987124-0-44998";"Do you know why the betrayer did this?"
"204987124-0-44999";"Why don't you have those books?"
"204987124-0-45000";"What can you tell me about Abelazar the betrayer?"
"204987124-0-45001";"What is the Trial of Air?"

"204987124-0-45005";"How are the trials still running?"
"204987124-0-45006";"How are the trials still running?"
"204987124-0-45007";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-45008";"How are the trials still running?"
"204987124-0-45009";"Tell me what you know about the trials."
"204987124-0-45010";"What now?"
"204987124-0-45012";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-45013";"What can you tell me about the trials?"
"204987124-0-45014";"The founder?"
"204987124-0-45015";"The one who sent him?"
"204987124-0-45016";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-45017";"What can you tell me about the trials?"
"204987124-0-45018";"Where are these other schools?"
"204987124-0-45019";"Tell me what happened here."
"204987124-0-45020";"Tell me what happened here."
"204987124-0-45021";"You mentioned not drinking the water. Why?"
"204987124-0-45022";"Yes. Can you tell me how to defeat the Celestials?"
"204987124-0-45023";"I'll pay your price, whatever it is."
"204987124-0-45024";"Are you saying the Serpent is controlling the other Guardians?"
"204987124-0-45025";"How do we stop him?"
"204987124-0-45026";"Are you really the Thief constellation?"
"204987124-0-45027";"How do I free the Guardians?"
"204987124-0-45028";"Tell me about the Guardians."

"204987124-0-45034";"What can you tell me about this city?"
"204987124-0-45035";"Who was Shada?"
"204987124-0-45036";"So you have to stay here forever?"
"204987124-0-45037";"What do you mean she cursed you to save you?"
"204987124-0-45038";"What is Shada's curse?"
"204987124-0-45039";"Why did the Yokudans attack?"
"204987124-0-45040";"The Yokudan general has been defeated."
"204987124-0-45041";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-45042";"And that is?"
"204987124-0-45044";"What is Shada's curse?"
"204987124-0-45045";"What is the significance of the goblets?"
"204987124-0-45046";"And the other trials?"
"204987124-0-45047";"This is a Daedric shrine?"
"204987124-0-45048";"Why didn't you tell me this sooner?"
"204987124-0-45049";"How do you know Hermaeus Mora will tell you anything?"
"204987124-0-45050";"What do you mean?"

"204987124-0-45057";"How do you know Hermaeus Mora will tell you anything?"
"204987124-0-45058";"All because of the water?"
"204987124-0-45060";"Is anyone else alive?"
"204987124-0-45062";"Tell me about Klause."
"204987124-0-45063";"Tell me about Squan."

"204987124-0-45068";"Do you know what caused the curse?"
"204987124-0-45069";"So how do we end the curse?"
"204987124-0-45070";"You think the Nereids are behind the curse?"
"204987124-0-45071";"What about the main chamber?"
"204987124-0-45072";"Who is Shada?"
"204987124-0-45074";"Do you know how to cleanse the curse?"
"204987124-0-45075";"Who are the Blackcaster mages?"
"204987124-0-45076";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-45078";"Did you say something about the Blackcaster mages harvesting magicka from other mages?"
"204987124-0-45079";"Did you say something about the Blackcaster mages harvesting magicka from other mages?"
"204987124-0-45080";"What was the cost?"
"204987124-0-45081";"What kind of magic do the Blackcaster mages practice?"
"204987124-0-45082";"We? Were you one of them?"
"204987124-0-45083";"What else can you tell me about Yamanu-ko?"
"204987124-0-45084";"Tell me more about the city of Elinhir."
"204987124-0-45085";"Does the Mages Guild know what's happened here?"
"204987124-0-45086";"You mentioned the Blackcaster mages. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-45087";"The mages protected the city?"
"204987124-0-45088";"You mentioned Blackcaster mages. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-45089";"Tell me about the city of Elinhir."
"204987124-0-45090";"I'll search the city and crypt wings for the source of the corruption."
"204987124-0-45091";"Who is Shada?"
"204987124-0-45092";"The Nereids?"
"204987124-0-45093";"What pillars?"
"204987124-0-45097";"I have some questions for you."
"204987124-0-45098";"I'll destroy the Nedic devices."
"204987124-0-45099";"Why did the atronachs turn against you?"
"204987124-0-45100";"How can we do that?"
"204987124-0-45101";"Any advice?"
"204987124-0-45102";"I have some questions for you."
"204987124-0-45103";"How will killing Zal'ik free you?"
"204987124-0-45104";"You promised to tell me everything you knew about the curse."
"204987124-0-45106";"What is that?"
"204987124-0-45107";"A cloud of poison?"
"204987124-0-45108";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-45110";"You were a priest in this city?"
"204987124-0-45111";"Why did the Yokudans attack the city?"
"204987124-0-45112";"The people didn't always worship the Nereids?"
"204987124-0-45113";"I'd like to know about Shada's Tear."
"204987124-0-45114";"You were a priest to the stars?"
"204987124-0-45115";"Tell me more about the Yokudan invasion."
"204987124-0-45116";"I'd like to know about Shada's Tear."
"204987124-0-45117";"Does it say where to find Shada?"
"204987124-0-45118";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-45120";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-45121";"Do we bind it?"
"204987124-0-45123";"Why suspend your search?"
"204987124-0-45124";"Was anyone inside when the gap collapsed?"
"204987124-0-45125";"How did the Serpent gain control of the atronachs?"
"204987124-0-45126";"Did you find it?"
"204987124-0-45128";"How do we get inside?"
"204987124-0-45130";"I'll find and defeat the air atronach."
"204987124-0-45131";"Hara wanted us to go inside."
"204987124-0-45133";"I understand. I will clear the shards of spellfiends."
"204987124-0-45135";"Not having any luck?"
"204987124-0-45137";"Well, I hope you find what you're looking for."
"204987124-0-45138";"So if I wanted to join the Guild …?"
"204987124-0-45139";"I'm still not sure how this plan is supposed to work."
"204987124-0-45140";"Did you say you were Gabrielle Benele's sister?"
"204987124-0-45141";"I'm still not sure how this plan is supposed to work."
"204987124-0-45142";"I'm still not sure how this plan is supposed to work."
"204987124-0-45143";"How do I recharge the gems?"
"204987124-0-45145";"Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-45146";"Fortunate how?"
"204987124-0-45148";"You're not going to be a problem are you?"
"204987124-0-45149";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-45151";"I gathered its missing gems and charged them with magicka."
"204987124-0-45152";"Tell me where to go and I'll find them."
"204987124-0-45154";"Any advice on where I should start?"
"204987124-0-45155";"So why are you still here?"
"204987124-0-45156";"I'd like to talk about the Celestial Warrior."
"204987124-0-45157";"I'd like to talk about the Celestial Warrior."
"204987124-0-45158";"The other aspects are waiting for you at the winery outside Belkarth."
"204987124-0-45160";"I need to get you back to the others. They're at the winery outside Belkarth."
"204987124-0-45162";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-45163";"Maybe Hara understood what was happening and tried to give us a clue."
"204987124-0-45165";"I'll find her, Nazdura."
"204987124-0-45166";"So how do we stop her?"
"204987124-0-45167";"Apex Stone?"
"204987124-0-45168";"How can you join with the Lost One?"
"204987124-0-45169";"Not much of an army …."
"204987124-0-45170";"I guess you're in no position to help with the Celestial threat?"
"204987124-0-45171";"And what about you?"
"204987124-0-45172";"The supply train?"
"204987124-0-45173";"I see. But why pose as a mortal?"
"204987124-0-45174";"Now what?"
"204987124-0-45176";"I'm ready. Take me back to Belkarth."
"204987124-0-45177";"How did such a thing happen?"
"204987124-0-45178";"Can't we just destroy the Apex Stone?"
"204987124-0-45180";"This is a real mess. How long will it take to clear?"
"204987124-0-45181";"You're kidding."
"204987124-0-45182";"So why are you here?"
"204987124-0-45184";"Well, good luck."
"204987124-0-45185";"Tell me more about Kelmen Locke."
"204987124-0-45186";"How did she do that?"
"204987124-0-45187";"Tell me more about Kelmen Locke."
"204987124-0-45188";"How were the atronachs summoned?"
"204987124-0-45189";"Where do I find this gem?"
"204987124-0-45190";"And then?"
"204987124-0-45192";"Yes, I'll release you."
"204987124-0-45193";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-45194";"Have we stopped the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-45195";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-45197";"So if I wanted to join the Guild …?"
"204987124-0-45199";"So if I wanted to join the Guild …?"
"204987124-0-45202";"What if I want to join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-45203";"Why have you suspended your search?"
"204987124-0-45205";"What if I want to join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-45206";"Why suspend your search?"
"204987124-0-45208";"What if I want to join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-45209";"Isn't this legion property?"
"204987124-0-45211";"You have that memorized?"
"204987124-0-45212";"Circumstances?"
"204987124-0-45213";"Belkarth isn't far. You could walk it."
"204987124-0-45215";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-45216";"How do we defeat them?"
"204987124-0-45217";"What else can you tell me about Yamanu-ko?"
"204987124-0-45218";"Where did he go?"
"204987124-0-45219";"Did they meet with Hara yet?"
"204987124-0-45221";"Have they given you a reason not to believe them?"
"204987124-0-45222";"How do we fix the Seeker's Sight?"
"204987124-0-45224";"I'll find the gems and restore the Seeker's Sight."
"204987124-0-45226";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-45227";"I … uh …."
"204987124-0-45228";"I don't really …."
"204987124-0-45230";"Well … good luck?"
"204987124-0-45231";"How did you come to serve as a member of Tarish-Zi's Royal Guard?"
"204987124-0-45232";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-45233";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-45234";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-45235";"So you helped the Yokudans?"
"204987124-0-45236";"Tell me more about Tarish-Zi."
"204987124-0-45237";"Who was she?"
"204987124-0-45238";"It was the Celestial Warrior who pulled you here?"
"204987124-0-45239";"But the Anka-Ra are still out there."
"204987124-0-45240";"And Tarish-Zi was summoned the same way?"
"204987124-0-45241";"Tell me more about Tarish-Zi."
"204987124-0-45242";"And you think this Imperial cheated by using magic?"
"204987124-0-45244";"Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-45245";"Any idea why?"
"204987124-0-45246";"Did they do all this?"
"204987124-0-45247";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-45249";"How do you know they won't attack again?"
"204987124-0-45252";"Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-45253";"What are you trying to forget?"
"204987124-0-45254";"Are you sure you weren't just too drunk?"
"204987124-0-45255";"His dream?"
"204987124-0-45256";"How did a powerful conjurer like you manage to get captured by mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-45257";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-45258";"Tell me more about how you summoned the atronachs."
"204987124-0-45259";"Tell me more about how you summoned the atronachs."
"204987124-0-45260";"What brought you here?"
"204987124-0-45261";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-45262";"Do you know what Hara needs from me?"
"204987124-0-45263";"Hara killed the Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-45264";"Sounds good. Can I ask you a few other questions?"
"204987124-0-45265";"Seems like a tough way to make a living."
"204987124-0-45267";"Troll food? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-45268";"Did you kill these two Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-45270";"But Satakal is a snake, right?"
"204987124-0-45271";"Fools? The Scaled Court plans to destroy Craglorn … maybe all of Tamriel."
"204987124-0-45273";"So you do believe in the end of days, after all."
"204987124-0-45274";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-45275";"What did Agganor do?"
"204987124-0-45276";"The death of sun and feathers?"
"204987124-0-45277";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-45278";"What does the Scaled Court have to do with all this?"
"204987124-0-45279";"And why have they come to Skyreach again?"
"204987124-0-45280";"What else can you tell me about nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-45281";"Why does the Scaled Court want to ally with the Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-45282";"A seat at their table?"
"204987124-0-45283";"What did they do to you?"
"204987124-0-45284";"You must have some theories about the element."
"204987124-0-45285";"Tell me more about these ruins."
"204987124-0-45286";"But why does the Scaled Court want nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-45287";"Does anyone still live there?"
"204987124-0-45288";"Tell me more about nirncrux?"
"204987124-0-45289";"Why didn't the Yokudans claim Skyreach for themselves?"
"204987124-0-45290";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-45291";"Unfortunately, I do."
"204987124-0-45293";"That just sounds … sad."
"204987124-0-45294";"Tell me more about the mantikoras."
"204987124-0-45296";"Progenitor mantikora?"
"204987124-0-45297";"Why does the Serpent need a new creature?"
"204987124-0-45298";"That doesn't really answer my question."
"204987124-0-45299";"What other creatures are used to create the mantikoras?"
"204987124-0-45300";"Tell me more about the mantikoras."
"204987124-0-45301";"And what's the final component in the alchemical process?"
"204987124-0-45302";"Tell me more about Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-45303";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-45304";"You said poisonous? How poisonous?"
"204987124-0-45306";"So why do you keep digging?"
"204987124-0-45307";"Red brittle?"
"204987124-0-45308";"Is there anything you can do to help her?"
"204987124-0-45310";"Nirncrux? Is that the same as red brittle?"
"204987124-0-45311";"More than just caravan guards?"
"204987124-0-45312";"Tell me more about the progenitor mantikora."
"204987124-0-45313";"I thought the Caravan Company had a bad reputation."
"204987124-0-45316";"They really use the mortal races to create the mantikoras?"
"204987124-0-45318";"Who's in charge of the company?"
"204987124-0-45319";"I remember! You're the company that hires thugs and rowdies."
"204987124-0-45320";"You have to admit, some of your guards are a bit rough around the edges."
"204987124-0-45321";"How has Dragonstar withstood the Iron Orc attacks?"
"204987124-0-45322";"Tell me more about the Dragonstar Caravan Company."
"204987124-0-45323";"What's that strange, red stone they're piling up outside?"
"204987124-0-45324";"Is the red brittle really worth that much?"
"204987124-0-45325";"You called the red brittle ""shake stone?"""
"204987124-0-45326";"Who's in charge of the company?"
"204987124-0-45327";"I don't know. Why did the miner's husband run off with the lusty Argonian?"
"204987124-0-45329";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-45330";"He was the High King's friend and he helped cause the downfall of the Nedes?"
"204987124-0-45331";"How do I find my way through such a place?"
"204987124-0-45332";"The Divines sent you to the catacombs?"
"204987124-0-45333";"You might be on a first-name basis with the Orc leaders, but diplomacy isn't going to work."
"204987124-0-45334";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-45335";"You're the leader of the Scaled Court. Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-45336";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-45337";"Tell me more about the catacombs."
"204987124-0-45338";"Why would Virmaril betray his friend?"
"204987124-0-45339";"Is this the main entrance to the catacombs?"
"204987124-0-45340";"What else do you know about Virmaril?"
"204987124-0-45341";"Don't you think the Scaled Court and the Serpent are a more immediate concern?"
"204987124-0-45342";"But the Scaled Court is evil."
"204987124-0-45343";"Who's Exarch Braadoth?"
"204987124-0-45344";"You're a member of the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-45345";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-45346";"Why are the Iron Orcs building an army of trolls?"
"204987124-0-45347";"Can they really train trolls?"
"204987124-0-45348";"Who's Regent Cassipia?"
"204987124-0-45349";"What else do you know about Virmaril?"
"204987124-0-45350";"How in the world can an Iron Orc train savage trolls?"
"204987124-0-45351";"How do you know so much about the Iron Orcs?"
"204987124-0-45352";"So what are you hiding?"
"204987124-0-45353";"Where's the rest of your group?"
"204987124-0-45354";"You like this whole cloak of mystery thing, don't you?"
"204987124-0-45355";"But there's no one else here."
"204987124-0-45356";"Why are you wearing a mask?"
"204987124-0-45357";"So … you have a group to fight with you in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45358";"It certainly is … unusual."
"204987124-0-45359";"So you won't tell me your real name?"
"204987124-0-45360";"An illusion?"
"204987124-0-45361";"Why are you wearing a mask?"
"204987124-0-45362";"That's a pretty bleak view of the world."
"204987124-0-45363";"What can you tell me about the armorer?"
"204987124-0-45364";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-45365";"Before we go, tell me about the runescriber."
"204987124-0-45366";"What do you know about Runescriber Kulth?"
"204987124-0-45367";"Nirncrux dust?"
"204987124-0-45368";"What's nirncrux dust?"
"204987124-0-45369";"Tell me about Armorer Uthik."
"204987124-0-45370";"Tell me about Runescriber Kulth."
"204987124-0-45371";"How in the world can an Iron Orc train savage trolls?"
"204987124-0-45372";"So where do we have to go?"
"204987124-0-45373";"You're the leader of the Scaled Court. Why should I trust you?"
"204987124-0-45374";"What can you tell me about the other competitors?"
"204987124-0-45375";"Maybe the reward is simply bragging rights."
"204987124-0-45376";"You call yourselves the Five Claws?"
"204987124-0-45377";"There must be someone you're worried about."
"204987124-0-45378";"You haven't seen any of them in action?"
"204987124-0-45379";"You call yourselves the Five Claws?"
"204987124-0-45380";"So, he wasn't ready for this level of competition?"
"204987124-0-45381";"What kind of surprises?"
"204987124-0-45382";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-45383";"You're my … king?"
"204987124-0-45384";"Are you sure you're really a king?"
"204987124-0-45385";"You really plan to fight in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45386";"You have a castle?"
"204987124-0-45387";"I only see three of you."
"204987124-0-45388";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-45389";"Um, six and three adds up to nine."
"204987124-0-45390";"Why do you want to compete in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45391";"Imperial law?"
"204987124-0-45392";"Any idea what's inside the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45393";"With just four warriors?"
"204987124-0-45394";"You seem pretty confident."
"204987124-0-45395";"What are Imperial soldiers doing here?"
"204987124-0-45396";"So you don't think they stand a chance against your group?"
"204987124-0-45397";"What are imperial soldiers doing here?"
"204987124-0-45398";"Stone-Fish? That's the name of your group?"
"204987124-0-45399";"All that gear must be expensive."
"204987124-0-45400";"How long have you been waiting to enter the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45401";"Your patrons?"
"204987124-0-45402";"Three groups? That doesn't sound too bad."
"204987124-0-45403";"What's a Stone-Fish?"
"204987124-0-45404";"You sound a little worried."
"204987124-0-45405";"Gaining the powers of a celestial is bad?"
"204987124-0-45406";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-45407";"You're part of the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-45408";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-45409";"But you didn't join up?"
"204987124-0-45411";"So now you're competing in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45412";"Excuse me?"
"204987124-0-45414";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-45415";"Holstagg can't do that himself?"
"204987124-0-45416";"He's just standing there."
"204987124-0-45417";"Accidents?"
"204987124-0-45418";"Will Holstagg fight in the Arena?"
"204987124-0-45419";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-45420";"Why was Holstagg crying?"
"204987124-0-45421";"So who are you again?"
"204987124-0-45422";"Why did you leave the farm?"
"204987124-0-45423";"You don't worship the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-45424";"You mean the Serpent isn't the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-45425";"Tell me more about these creatures."
"204987124-0-45426";"You're suggesting that the Celestials …?"
"204987124-0-45427";"And you believe the Nedes created these things?"
"204987124-0-45428";"I'm not sure I should trust a member of the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-45429";"What purpose did these creatures serve?"
"204987124-0-45440";"And what else can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-45441";"I'm not sure I should trust a member of the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-45442";"Tell me about the larger creature."
"204987124-0-45443";"You want to return to your own time?"
"204987124-0-45444";"Does it have anything to do with the Serpent?"
"204987124-0-45445";"Did Kelmen mention a name?"
"204987124-0-45446";"Tell me about this magical disturbance the Thief detected."
"204987124-0-45447";"So you have no idea what kind of disturbance we might be dealing with?"
"204987124-0-45448";"What have you been doing since last we met?"
"204987124-0-45449";"Could this friend be involved in the magical disturbance somehow?"
"204987124-0-45450";"What have you been up to since the last time I saw you?"
"204987124-0-45452";"They needed help. They said they opposed the Serpent and the Scaled Court."
"204987124-0-45453";"Why did Kelmen go after Cassipia by himself?"
"204987124-0-45454";"Can Cassipia really become the Serpent's equal?"
"204987124-0-45455";"I met Regent Cassipia and Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-45456";"She collected something from the mantikoras and the armored trolls. And some of the nirncrux."
"204987124-0-45457";"Is Kelmen really dead?"
"204987124-0-45458";"I met Regent Cassipia and Little Leaf."
"204987124-0-45459";"So why don't you simply quit the organization?"
"204987124-0-45460";"I can help with that."
"204987124-0-45461";"I'll meet you at the Howling Sepulchers."
"204987124-0-45463";"Why did you come to this desolate place?"
"204987124-0-45465";"And this sword can help Titus recover his memories?"
"204987124-0-45466";"Where can I find this Iron Orc?"
"204987124-0-45468";"I'll find Skarath and retrieve the blade."
"204987124-0-45469";"So, painting is just a hobby for you?"
"204987124-0-45470";"What brings you to Craglorn?"
"204987124-0-45471";"Sounds like you don't actually like it."
"204987124-0-45472";"You're not worried about Iron Orcs or the Scaled Court?"
"204987124-0-45473";"Are you any good at painting?"
"204987124-0-45474";"The other summoned soldiers, such as Tarish-Zi, were controlled by the Serpent. Why wasn't Titus?"
"204987124-0-45476";"Did you know Titus would lose his memories?"
"204987124-0-45477";"You seem a little out of place."
"204987124-0-45478";"So you're not one of them?"
"204987124-0-45479";"What do you do around here?"
"204987124-0-45480";"Merry?"
"204987124-0-45481";"And that's it?"
"204987124-0-45482";"What are you writing about?"
"204987124-0-45483";"Is any of it worth listening to?"
"204987124-0-45484";"How will people see your story?"
"204987124-0-45485";"Are you a member of this group?"
"204987124-0-45486";"So it's not being published?"
"204987124-0-45487";"You seem nervous."
"204987124-0-45489";"I guess not."
"204987124-0-45490";"What would you call it?"
"204987124-0-45491";"Does your commander see it that way?"
"204987124-0-45493";"You work for Isrudde?"
"204987124-0-45494";"What did you do to deserve a beheading?"
"204987124-0-45496";"That sounds pretty … intense."
"204987124-0-45497";"How long have you traveled with Isrudde?"
"204987124-0-45498";"Are all these goods from Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-45499";"Even the Wood Elf over there?"
"204987124-0-45500";"Are all these goods from Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-45501";"You're not troubled by taking the belongings of dead soldiers?"
"204987124-0-45502";"Looks like you have some unsavory companions."
"204987124-0-45503";"What kind of uses?"
"204987124-0-45504";"What's going on here?"
"204987124-0-45505";"Why not find smarter companions?"
"204987124-0-45506";"""Discarded?"""
"204987124-0-45507";"So, you make a profit from the war?"
"204987124-0-45508";"Are you the leader of this outfit?"
"204987124-0-45509";"How do you hold them off?"
"204987124-0-45510";"Are you the leader of this outfit?"
"204987124-0-45511";"That's not going to work forever."
"204987124-0-45512";"If you return to your time, will your memories come back?"
"204987124-0-45518";"So, do you plan to capture him, or—?"
"204987124-0-45519";"He's probably still in the next room. If we go in together—?"
"204987124-0-45521";"All right. Any advice for facing Velador?"
"204987124-0-45522";"More than a few indeed. Does that merit a reward?"
"204987124-0-45530";"All right. I'll bring you your reagents."
"204987124-0-45531";"Magister Therana?"
"204987124-0-45532";"Do you have any idea what she wants?"
"204987124-0-45533";"How do you earn the magister's approval?"
"204987124-0-45534";"You can earn your freedom?"
"204987124-0-45535";"I'll try to get the information for you."
"204987124-0-45537";"<Burn the webs.>"
"204987124-0-45541";"Are you working with the slavers?"
"204987124-0-45542";"So how do we get out of here?"
"204987124-0-45543";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-45545";"All right, let's test my fighting skills."
"204987124-0-45547";"What are you going to do while I get the gear and the key?"
"204987124-0-45548";"Any idea who these slavers are?"
"204987124-0-45563";"Here's the gate key."
"204987124-0-45564";"Is this legal? Why do I see so many of my fellow Argonians in bondage?"
"204987124-0-45565";"Who are the Telvanni, exactly?"
"204987124-0-45566";"Can I help you break free?"
"204987124-0-45567";"Can I help you break free?"
"204987124-0-45568";"I'll find Naryu at the overlook."
"204987124-0-45570";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-45571";"So what do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-45572";"Why should I help an assassin?"
"204987124-0-45588";"Where is Hara now?"
"204987124-0-45590";"Thanks. I'll go see her."
"204987124-0-45591";"How do you propose we do that?"
"204987124-0-45592";"How confident are you that Therana will trade the relic for her sponsorship?"
"204987124-0-45614";"I have the finger bone of Saint Felms, taken from Zaintiraris."
"204987124-0-45616";"Yes. She needs you to endorse her bid for freedom and sponsor her as a Hireling of House Telvanni."
"204987124-0-45617";"Why couldn't you have simply gone into Zaintiraris yourself?"
"204987124-0-45618";"What will you do with that relic?"
"204987124-0-45619";"Why live in a tower way out in the wilderness?"
"204987124-0-45620";"Why couldn't you have simply gone into Zaintiraris yourself?"
"204987124-0-45621";"Sun-in-Shadow said you were new to your rank."
"204987124-0-45699";"Excellent."
"204987124-0-45708";"I can do that much, but won't your mother be suspicious if I ask about Tirwin?"
"204987124-0-45709";"All right, I will speak to your mother about Tirwin."
"204987124-0-45712";"Only her price. I need someone with a talent for collecting red star shells."
"204987124-0-45714";"Your ""friends"" gossip about more than Tirwin's talents. We'd both benefit from her departure."
"204987124-0-45716";"All right, I'll think over your terms."
"204987124-0-45717";"A short cut? Camp? You don't actually remember what happened, do you?"
"204987124-0-45718";"All Dark Elves have red eyes. But why did you agree to escort a witch to Vivec City?"
"204987124-0-45719";"Why are you naked, by the way?"
"204987124-0-45720";"Do you feel the same way about pants?"
"204987124-0-45721";"He apparently fled for his life when you started yelling and casting spells."
"204987124-0-45722";"All right, I'll think over your terms."
"204987124-0-45723";"I can look for the Goblins and retrieve your pack."
"204987124-0-45724";"Tell me more about Stromgruf and your missing items."

"204987124-0-45728";"He thinks you two are in love."
"204987124-0-45729";"They're the price of your freedom. He wants me to buy and free you, so you two can marry."
"204987124-0-45730";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-45732";"Why risk it? I already have your slave-price."
"204987124-0-45740";"I doubt Malur gave you a true account. I found these orders on an assassin sent to kill me."
"204987124-0-45744";"And you lost control of it?"
"204987124-0-45745";"Is there no cure for this affliction?"

"204987124-0-45762";"What happened to Zoreh?"
"204987124-0-45764";"Actually, do you have any tips for lighting the fires in time?"

"204987124-0-45772";"Who is Zoreh the Tenacious?"
"204987124-0-45777";"If you're a hireling, will you be able to leave? I thought you were headed to Black Marsh."
"204987124-0-45780";"How do you earn the magister's approval?"
"204987124-0-45784";"All right. I'm ready to donate."

"204987124-0-45799";"I'll leave you to your cooking."
"204987124-0-45802";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-45805";"All but Mabkir. Nakhul thinks this was a bad deal. Why did you defy the Camonna Tong?"
"204987124-0-45807";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-45809";"What should I be looking for exactly?"
"204987124-0-45810";"Do you know where the gold and mercenaries are coming from?"
"204987124-0-45815";"As a hireling, do you still work for the Magisters?"
"204987124-0-45816";"You seemed fairly independent even before you were made a hireling."
"204987124-0-45817";"Where is this Menwendel?"
"204987124-0-45819";"What will you do in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-45821";"Which way did they go?"
"204987124-0-45824";"You're the first I've found. Do you know where the others are?"
"204987124-0-45825";"So how do you plan to defy their expectations?"
"204987124-0-45829";"Llayne sent me. We think Savarak's trying to poison Tel Mora. <Show her the malignant growth.>"
"204987124-0-45831";"I'll find your sample and put a stop to things here."
"204987124-0-45836";"I'll look into it."

"204987124-0-45852";"Have you seen any Daedra there?"
"204987124-0-45855";"What do you mean, attracted?"
"204987124-0-45856";"I'll distract them. You make a run for it."

"204987124-0-45861";"How much did you pay him?"
"204987124-0-45864";"What does a member of the Fighters Guild do?"
"204987124-0-45866";"What happened to the other freed slaves, Mabkir and Wih-Waska?"
"204987124-0-45867";"Wih-Waska survived but Mabkir wasn't so lucky. You should get going."
"204987124-0-45869";"What's the reward for my service?"
"204987124-0-45870";"What does a member of the Fighters Guild do?"

"204987124-0-45872";"Get ready. I'll distract them."
"204987124-0-45880";"I'll find them. Now get out of here. Nakhul's waiting for you outside."
"204987124-0-45882";"You're still in danger. Go find Nakhul—he waits for you outside."
"204987124-0-45887";"You're still in danger. Go find Nakhul—he waits for you outside."

"204987124-0-46346";"What should we look for?"
"204987124-0-46347";"What about the hidden passages?"
"204987124-0-46351";"If I help will you answer my questions?"
"204987124-0-46354";"What do you want me to do again?"
"204987124-0-46355";"Like a rainbow. Got it."
"204987124-0-46363";"Just that the shrine contains the saints bones and other relics."
"204987124-0-46364";"You think Saint Veloth is buried here?"
"204987124-0-46365";"What should we look for?"
"204987124-0-46366";"But why would this solve Dratha's problem?"
"204987124-0-46368";"Saint Veloth's shrine is in Deshaan?"
"204987124-0-46369";"What should we look for?"
"204987124-0-46370";"Hold on. Where can I find these shrines?"
"204987124-0-46371";"A bargain with Daedra?"
"204987124-0-46372";"And once I'm there?"
"204987124-0-46373";"Just what are these stones exactly?"
"204987124-0-46379";"You can't just talk to him about your concerns?"
"204987124-0-46380";"So why the concern that something improper is going on down there?"
"204987124-0-46381";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-46382";"Something in particular I should be looking for?"
"204987124-0-46383";"You seem nervous."
"204987124-0-46384";"Why don't you have a key to your own mine?"
"204987124-0-46386";"And once in the mine?"
"204987124-0-46388";"Did Sotha Sil reach a conclusion?"
"204987124-0-46389";"These notes should be helpful. Can I ask you a few more questions?"
"204987124-0-46390";"That tool you mentioned, is it a weapon?"
"204987124-0-46391";"Archcanon Tarvus sent me."
"204987124-0-46392";"What's the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-46393";"Do you know where the tool is now?"
"204987124-0-46394";"You worked with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-46395";"What kind of help do you need?"
"204987124-0-46396";"Why am I examining the unusual items exactly?"
"204987124-0-46397";"Your brother rules over the Ashlander tribes?"
"204987124-0-46398";"Who's your brother?"
"204987124-0-46399";"What's the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-46400";"You think Chodala wants a war?"
"204987124-0-46401";"The Tribunal betrayed Nerevar?"
"204987124-0-46402";"What's the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-46403";"What do you think is the source of Chodala's new power?"
"204987124-0-46405";"But aren't we disturbing them?"
"204987124-0-46411";"I choose the Hand Mirror"
"204987124-0-46427";"I investigated the three locations. Here's what I learned."
"204987124-0-46428";"You're going to just read the notes? I thought we could discuss what I learned."
"204987124-0-46429";"Barilzar told me about Sotha Sil's experiments with divine energy. He gave me his notes."
"204987124-0-46430";"Chodala's newfound power might have something to do with Vivec's problem."
"204987124-0-46431";"Chodala is using Sunna'rah to steal Vivec's divine energy?"
"204987124-0-46432";"Vivec sent away all his priests?"
"204987124-0-46433";"Barilzar told me about Sotha Sil's experiments with divine energy. He gave me his notes."
"204987124-0-46434";"I should place the Hand Mirror"
"204987124-0-46435";"You're going to be fine. Revus needs you to perform back in Gnisis."
"204987124-0-46445";"What do you suggest we do next?"
"204987124-0-46446";"How do you recognize items of historic significance?"
"204987124-0-46454";"Is that why you always want me to go first?"
"204987124-0-46455";"What do you suggest we do next?"
"204987124-0-46456";"Is that what you told your apprentice in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-46469";"It's not?"
"204987124-0-46470";"Why don't you have a key to your own mine?"
"204987124-0-46471";"You'd send me against your family's own hired guards?"
"204987124-0-46473";"Hopefully not. So, what exactly do you do here?"
"204987124-0-46478";"Newly discovered dungeons?"
"204987124-0-46479";"I'll be sure to speak to you once I've laid claim to a new dungeon."
"204987124-0-46481";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-46482";"I'll be sure to speak with her."
"204987124-0-46486";"You didn't investigate further?"
"204987124-0-46488";"I'll let you know what I find."
"204987124-0-46489";"Ruddy Man? What is that?"
"204987124-0-46491";"Follow me. I'll lead you out of here, safely."
"204987124-0-46493";"You said you handle the hiring. Did you hire Gavros?"
"204987124-0-46494";"How long will you be meeting with this Councilor Rayveth?"
"204987124-0-46495";"He's dead. Killed by his own formula."
"204987124-0-46496";"What do you think the Council will do to Benar?"
"204987124-0-46497";"You really didn't know anything about this?"
"204987124-0-46498";"He said the monster came upon them from atop the nearby glass mine."
"204987124-0-46500";"That remains to be seen. Regardless, something is getting in and out of the mine despite the guards."
"204987124-0-46501";"A short cut? Camp? You don't actually remember what happened, do you?"
"204987124-0-46502";"Where should I look for this witch of yours?"
"204987124-0-46504";"Why do you think the cultists are conducting a ritual?"
"204987124-0-46505";"With what we know, we might convince the Armigers to clear out the mine sooner than planned."
"204987124-0-46507";"Why me?"
"204987124-0-46511";"What did you actually do to Stromgruf?"
"204987124-0-46512";"So you froze him for his own good?"
"204987124-0-46513";"What did you actually do to Stromgruf?"
"204987124-0-46514";"What did you actually do to Stromgruf?"
"204987124-0-46515";"Why are the pack and sword so important to you?"
"204987124-0-46516";"A blindfold?"
"204987124-0-46517";"Why are so many Ashlanders here?"
"204987124-0-46518";"First Ashkhans?"
"204987124-0-46519";"Wait—a rescue? What happened?"
"204987124-0-46521";"It sounds like you might need a hand. I'll help you rescue your family."
"204987124-0-46522";"Where can I find Farseer Kuamta?"
"204987124-0-46523";"How did the search bring you here?"
"204987124-0-46524";"Why do you think the Ashlanders might know where it is?"
"204987124-0-46525";"Tell me more about Chodala."
"204987124-0-46527";"Tell me more about Chodala."
"204987124-0-46528";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-46529";"Where can I find Farseer Kuamta?"
"204987124-0-46530";"What doesn't make sense?"
"204987124-0-46532";"I could help you find them."
"204987124-0-46533";"Only your blessing to participate in honoring the First Ashkhans."
"204987124-0-46534";"What offering should I bring to each cairn?"
"204987124-0-46536";"I heard you are becoming a Wise Woman?"
"204987124-0-46538";"And how do you plan on ridding the land of these spirits?"
"204987124-0-46539";"And this usually works?"
"204987124-0-46540";"Do you think your contemporary is right?"
"204987124-0-46541";"What is the Heart of Lorkhan?"
"204987124-0-46542";"What exactly is this relic you mentioned? The Bthark Prism?"
"204987124-0-46543";"And the other two?"
"204987124-0-46546";"What happened exactly? Did Lenarmen ambush you?"
"204987124-0-46547";"So you went back and rescued these others after Neramo escaped?"
"204987124-0-46548";"What happened exactly? Did Lenarmen ambush you?"
"204987124-0-46556";"They sound very giving."
"204987124-0-46558";"I'd like to know more."
"204987124-0-46559";"All right, fine. I'd like to know more."
"204987124-0-46561";"How do you know so much then?"
"204987124-0-46564";"I could just leave you in there."
"204987124-0-46566";"There's another section?"
"204987124-0-46567";"Wasn't it worth it just for the adventure?"
"204987124-0-46568";"Your adoring readers will devour that story, Narsis."
"204987124-0-46569";"You might want to get a closer look."
"204987124-0-46570";"I'm sure you can make it sound good when you write it."
"204987124-0-46571";"Have you been inside?"
"204987124-0-46575";"I could investigate it for you."
"204987124-0-46580";"I'll deliver the spear and your story. Do you want me to tell him anything else?"
"204987124-0-46582";"All right, I'll see if the wall plates will open this door."
"204987124-0-46589";"The Forge?"
"204987124-0-46591";"I'll put a stop to the Forge and save who I can."
"204987124-0-46592";"Tell me about the Wise Woman."
"204987124-0-46593";"Then I'll head for the Cavern of the Incarnate."
"204987124-0-46594";"We need to talk to the Wise Woman."
"204987124-0-46595";"What's the Cavern of the Incarnate?"
"204987124-0-46596";"Tell me more about the Nerevarine."
"204987124-0-46597";"What's the Cavern of the Incarnate?"
"204987124-0-46598";"What's the Cavern of the Incarnate?"
"204987124-0-46599";"Galgalah was taunting me. He wants us to come after him."
"204987124-0-46600";"What happens if we get it wrong?"
"204987124-0-46601";"So Lenarmen has it now?"
"204987124-0-46604";"Well, let me know if you think of something."
"204987124-0-46605";"Why is Artisan Lenarmen trying to abduct you?"
"204987124-0-46606";"Isn't there a way to prove he's not the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-46615";"But what about the matriarch? It said this was her tomb."
"204987124-0-46617";"<Enter the Maw of Lorkhaj.>"
"204987124-0-46619";"<Enter Sanctum Ophidia.>"
"204987124-0-46621";"<Enter Hel Ra Citadel.>"
"204987124-0-46623";"<Enter Aetherian Archive.>"
"204987124-0-46625";"The staff is the source of Chodala's power."
"204987124-0-46626";"I'll do what you ask."
"204987124-0-46630";"Dranoth killed Skar with it. Your ancestor struck the final blow that killed the Emperor Crab."
"204987124-0-46632";"The Ashlanders slaughtered them. Dranoth wants you to know that Ald'ruhn is your home."
"204987124-0-46637";"Problem?"
"204987124-0-46638";"How can I help you if I can't talk during the council?"
"204987124-0-46643";"When should I give you Incarnate Ranso's scroll?"
"204987124-0-46644";"When should I give you Incarnate Aduri's scroll?"
"204987124-0-46646";"When should I give you Incarnate Ranso's scroll?"
"204987124-0-46647";"When should I give you Incarnate Ranso's scroll?"
"204987124-0-46648";"What's ""Oh?"""
"204987124-0-46650";"So we can't turn the Dwarven constructs against the mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-46651";"Who are these ""beastmen"" besieging you?"
"204987124-0-46653";"The day's not lost just yet. I'll break the siege."
"204987124-0-46657";"So what's next?"
"204987124-0-46658";"Stay safe, Vimy."
"204987124-0-46663";"Do you think anyone will follow in Lenarmen's footsteps? Looking for the Heart of Lorkhan?"
"204987124-0-46665";"All right. You mentioned splitting the profits?"
"204987124-0-46672";"Where is it coming from? What do I need to do to fix it?"
"204987124-0-46689";"Tell me more about your mission at the tomb."
"204987124-0-46690";"There must be something I can do."
"204987124-0-46691";"Daedra?"
"204987124-0-46692";"Lord Vivec and Azura don't get along?"
"204987124-0-46693";"Vivec's a Living God?"
"204987124-0-46694";"What's a Buoyant Armiger?"
"204987124-0-46696";"The scroll contains a formula that can turn people into false ebony stone."
"204987124-0-46698";"All right. What will House Hlaalu do about this situation?"
"204987124-0-46699";"Did Malur give you the scroll?"
"204987124-0-46701";"What is this thing, exactly?"
"204987124-0-46704";"How do I prove that Chodala isn't the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-46705";"I have it here."
"204987124-0-46706";"Double. As you said."
"204987124-0-46707";"It's best that no one can use it again."
"204987124-0-46708";"Take it. <Hand over the scroll.>"
"204987124-0-46711";"Do you think the egg-hands will be all right?"
"204987124-0-46713";"Thank you. I'll speak to the foreman."
"204987124-0-46716";"What was that machine, exactly?"
"204987124-0-46717";"You mentioned it might have been used for slavery?"
"204987124-0-46718";"Why were you fiddling with this device?"
"204987124-0-46719";"So slavery through mind-control?"
"204987124-0-46720";"Didn't you know about the Gnisis mines being connected?"
"204987124-0-46721";"What was that machine, exactly?"
"204987124-0-46722";"What was that machine, exactly?"
"204987124-0-46723";"Earplugs?"
"204987124-0-46724";"Tell me more about your mission at the tomb."
"204987124-0-46725";"Tell me more about your mission at the tomb."
"204987124-0-46726";"Where is your costume now?"
"204987124-0-46727";"Do you think you can walk? I could try to get you out of here."
"204987124-0-46728";"How do you plan on doing that?"
"204987124-0-46730";"Tell me more about Azura."
"204987124-0-46731";"Where's the egg now?"
"204987124-0-46733";"All right. I'll find these egg-heaps and meet you back here."
"204987124-0-46736";"Why are these cliff striders storing the egg in a ""heap?"""
"204987124-0-46739";"This doesn't feel like much of a plan."
"204987124-0-46742";"You're not suggesting turning the Dwarven resonator back on, are you?"
"204987124-0-46743";"You're serious?"
"204987124-0-46744";"But the skull was hidden behind a gate, with magic protecting it from people like us."
"204987124-0-46746";"Very well, let's continue on."
"204987124-0-46747";"Have you heard from House Redoran about the mine problem yet?"
"204987124-0-46749";"Right. Is there a reason you called for me?"
"204987124-0-46751";"Who's Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-46752";"You're the one who created this mess. You need to fix it."
"204987124-0-46753";"All right, I'll meet you in the egg mine."
"204987124-0-46754";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-46755";"By ""reject"" do you mean ""kill?"""
"204987124-0-46777";"Revus's egg. We planted it in the nursery just before it hatched."
"204987124-0-46779";"I'm sure."
"204987124-0-46781";"Not worried about Manore?"
"204987124-0-46794";"A city in the Dominion."
"204987124-0-46799";"Grahtwood is my destination."
"204987124-0-46802";"Stormhaven is my destination"

"204987124-0-46837";"Deshaan, in the Ebonheart Pact."
"204987124-0-46840";"I located Sotha Sil's tool, but it's been altered to steal Lord Vivec's divine energy."
"204987124-0-46841";"Where can I find these hirelings of yours?"
"204987124-0-46842";"Do you think the Daedra will return to trouble you?"
"204987124-0-46843";"When I first arrived, I saw a vision of Azura."
"204987124-0-46844";"Here are the items you requested."
"204987124-0-46846";"So how do I use it to counteract Sunna'rah?"
"204987124-0-46848";"Is the tonal inverter hard to use?"
"204987124-0-46849";"Grahtwood, please."
"204987124-0-46852";"Auridon, right away."

"204987124-0-46914";"Shadowfen, when you're ready."
"204987124-0-46917";"Eastmarch, when you're ready."
"204987124-0-46920";"Auridon, in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-46923";"Grahtwood, in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-46926";"Greenshade, in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-46929";"Malabal Tor, in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-46932";"Reaper's March, in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-46935";"I'm interested. Tell me more about it."
"204987124-0-46937";"I need her help. It's going to take two of us to operate Barilzar's tonal inverter."
"204987124-0-46938";"Sunna'rah will soon be in our hands."
"204987124-0-46939";"I've got a device that will counter Sunna'rah, but I need your help to use it."
"204987124-0-46941";"I'll see you at Kaushtarari."
"204987124-0-46943";"Quakes?"
"204987124-0-46945";"""Celebrations?"" There are more than one?"
"204987124-0-46947";"Take a look at these instructions. They explain how to use the tonal inverter."
"204987124-0-46948";"Maybe you can clarify a few points before we head inside."
"204987124-0-46949";"You suspect the affliction isn't natural?"
"204987124-0-46950";"What do you mean that your divine energy has diminished?"
"204987124-0-46951";"What do you mean that your divine energy has diminished?"
"204987124-0-46953";"We should return to Vivec City."
"204987124-0-46957";"I'll plant Sunna'rah in the floor and return Vivec's power to him."
"204987124-0-46960";"Why are the Daedra relevant to all this?"
"204987124-0-46962";"If you removed the manacles, could he use his magic to escape?"
"204987124-0-46963";"You won?"
"204987124-0-46964";"Sun-in-Shadow gave me gold to purchase some land for her."
"204987124-0-46965";"When will Sun-in-Shadow be able to free you?"
"204987124-0-46967";"And Vos will be free of his reign."
"204987124-0-46969";"<Nod your head, ""yes."">"
"204987124-0-46970";"<Nod>"
"204987124-0-46973";"All right. Here goes."
"204987124-0-46974";"All right, I'll track her down."
"204987124-0-46978";"I'll track them down. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-46980";"How do you think Revus can help?"
"204987124-0-46981";"How do you suggest I do that?"
"204987124-0-46982";"I understand."
"204987124-0-46983";"Do you have a tonal inverter I can use?"
"204987124-0-46984";"Where can I find these hirelings of yours?"
"204987124-0-46985";"I'll return to Vivec City."
"204987124-0-46986";"That tool you mentioned, is it a weapon?"
"204987124-0-46987";"Is that why you're leaving?"
"204987124-0-46989";"So Savarak has legal sanction to rule here?"
"204987124-0-46991";"Was she a better ruler than Savarak?"
"204987124-0-46992";"Who is Mistress Dratha?"
"204987124-0-46993";"My partner? I don't have a partner."
"204987124-0-46995";"It seems your daughter knows your people and their tactics. She doesn't know me."
"204987124-0-46996";"I understand you claim to be the Nerevarine."
"204987124-0-46997";"I understand you claim to be the Nerevarine."
"204987124-0-46998";"Seryn doesn't seem to agree with you."
"204987124-0-46999";"All right. I'll try to find your daughter."
"204987124-0-47001";"You mentioned a family disagreement?"
"204987124-0-47002";"Maybe your wife would be willing to discuss that with me."
"204987124-0-47003";"Tell me more about the Morag Tong."
"204987124-0-47004";"<Point at Dwarven device.> What is this thing?"
"204987124-0-47005";"Do you think these kwama egg-hands could help?"
"204987124-0-47006";"What do the stones do?"
"204987124-0-47007";"Aren't you worried about using Daedric relics?"
"204987124-0-47008";"But where does the Nerevarine fit into all that?"
"204987124-0-47009";"You don't believe Chodala's claim?"
"204987124-0-47010";"What's the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-47011";"I suppose I can deliver it."
"204987124-0-47013";"Where can I find Master Firuth?"
"204987124-0-47017";"An Ashlander named Chodala has been inciting the tribes."
"204987124-0-47018";"Barilzar told me about Sotha Sil's experiments with divine energy. He gave me his notes."
"204987124-0-47019";"Yes. She'd appreciate your written support for her promotion to retainer."
"204987124-0-47020";"If you tell me about the cultists, I might be able to do something about it."
"204987124-0-47021";"Tell me about the cultists or I start yelling for the House guards."
"204987124-0-47023";"Maybe if I paid you for your trouble …?"
"204987124-0-47025";"Looks like you were injured."
"204987124-0-47026";"She wanted you to kill her?"
"204987124-0-47028";"I'll look for Nevena."
"204987124-0-47029";"Ashlanders?"
"204987124-0-47031";"Here's the writ. Firuth seemed pleased with the deal."
"204987124-0-47038";"So she's on the run."
"204987124-0-47039";"Where did the statue come from?"
"204987124-0-47040";"Why is your sister in a place like this?"
"204987124-0-47041";"You mentioned robed figures. Who else is out here?"
"204987124-0-47042";"She could have stolen it."
"204987124-0-47043";"Why is your sister here?"
"204987124-0-47044";"Can't Vivec perform the ritual without the Blessing Stone?"
"204987124-0-47045";"An Ashlander interrupted the cultists?"
"204987124-0-47046";"Sounds like you have a personal stake in this."
"204987124-0-47047";"Maybe her friends will be less suspicious if I approach them."
"204987124-0-47048";"I'll see if I can follow the note."
"204987124-0-47051";"Tell me about Veya's disagreement with her father."
"204987124-0-47052";"What do you think the note contains?"
"204987124-0-47053";"What will the two of you do once you're free?"
"204987124-0-47055";"Sun-in-Shadow seems pretty happy being a Telvanni Mage."
"204987124-0-47056";"What are you asking me to do?"
"204987124-0-47058";"All right. I'll go to the Council House in your stead."
"204987124-0-47059";"You should know this wasn't an accident. Cultists were interested in your sister for her bloodline."
"204987124-0-47060";"You don't want to share her fate."
"204987124-0-47061";"I'm only relaying what I uncovered."
"204987124-0-47062";"So you've given up?"
"204987124-0-47063";"Is there no cure for this affliction?"
"204987124-0-47064";"Why would you agree to this?"
"204987124-0-47065";"You have no remorse?"
"204987124-0-47066";"Is there no cure for this affliction?"
"204987124-0-47093";"You really had no idea that was going on in the mine?"
"204987124-0-47094";"Why are people in a panic?"
"204987124-0-47095";"Gothren's Mouth, Ralasa Delvi, seemed dead set against it."
"204987124-0-47096";"Why do the magisters have people who act as their Mouth?"
"204987124-0-47097";"Seems like Telvanni mages need a lot of things."
"204987124-0-47098";"Sounds like it."
"204987124-0-47099";"None of this troubles you?"
"204987124-0-47100";"I won't make any promises. Why don't you want him taken alive?"
"204987124-0-47101";"I'll find the Overseer and make sure she's all right."
"204987124-0-47104";"Did Malur give you the scroll?"
"204987124-0-47105";"I'll try. I have a few questions though."
"204987124-0-47106";"Why do the magisters have people who act as their Mouth?"
"204987124-0-47107";"Let's just say it's vital that I get a Blessing Stone for Lord Vivec."
"204987124-0-47108";"I met your wife. She's worried about you."
"204987124-0-47110";"All right."
"204987124-0-47114";"I only need a couple minutes of his time."
"204987124-0-47115";"I only need a couple minutes of his time."
"204987124-0-47116";"What kind of distraction are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-47117";"All right, I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-47118";"Won't you get in trouble for lying to them?"
"204987124-0-47119";"Thank you, Kizmar."
"204987124-0-47120";"What can I expect to face at the Salothan tomb?"
"204987124-0-47121";"Lord Vivec mentioned the Clockwork City's wards."
"204987124-0-47122";"Why don't you simply reveal the truth to the Ashlanders?"
"204987124-0-47123";"How do I prove that Chodala isn't the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-47124";"How do I prove that Chodala isn't the Nerevarine?"
"204987124-0-47125";"Do you know where the Clockwork City is located?"
"204987124-0-47130";"Yes. Barbas tricked us into draining Lord Vivec's divine energy."
"204987124-0-47132";"Can you get me to the Clockwork City or not?"
"204987124-0-47135";"I could, but why should I?"
"204987124-0-47136";"How did a Nereid wreck a ship?"
"204987124-0-47138";"It's a deal. I'll meet you in Sadrith Mora, but I have a few questions first."
"204987124-0-47139";"I won't keep you from escaping. I just need the tome, the gold, and the amulet."
"204987124-0-47140";"I'll tell Gothren I couldn't find you. Good luck."
"204987124-0-47141";"Can't you look for a better farmhand?"
"204987124-0-47142";"What exactly are you growing in Zainsipilu?"
"204987124-0-47143";"Knows too much about what?"
"204987124-0-47144";"We'll see."
"204987124-0-47145";"Who's this Falura?"
"204987124-0-47148";"I'm leaving."
"204987124-0-47149";"What's that note about then?"
"204987124-0-47151";"Who are you delivering this information to if you aren't in contact with Veya?"
"204987124-0-47152";"You're not in league with these bandits, are you?"
"204987124-0-47154";"Wait, are you asking me to assassinate Ralasa Delvi? That's your plan?"
"204987124-0-47156";"I can be very persuasive."
"204987124-0-47159";"All right. I'll help you assassinate Ralasa."
"204987124-0-47160";"You'll do anything for Veya?"
"204987124-0-47161";"I'm just trying to help out here. What harm will telling me about Veya's brother possibly cause?"
"204987124-0-47162";"Answer my question or I'll haul you off to the House Guard personally."
"204987124-0-47163";"Yes, she sends a gift. And news. Arith Sendrul tried to pull her into a plot to replace you."
"204987124-0-47164";"I'll deliver the message."
"204987124-0-47167";"What makes skooma so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-47168";"And you think Halinjirr plans to manufacture this drug?"
"204987124-0-47170";"I see your point."
"204987124-0-47171";"How did you get kicked out of the Oath-Bureau?"
"204987124-0-47174";"But how can we be certain the staff won't harm you again?"
"204987124-0-47176";"All right, I'll use the staff."
"204987124-0-47177";"No. She told me about her indiscretions. She was hoping this might help her make amends."
"204987124-0-47180";"Tell me more about the hidden treasure."
"204987124-0-47181";"Tell me more about Narsis Dren."
"204987124-0-47182";"I'm sure. He kept winding up locked in a sarcophagus."
"204987124-0-47183";"You really admire Narsis Dren, don't you?"
"204987124-0-47184";"Tell me more about the hidden treasure."
"204987124-0-47185";"So this is his handiwork? I think his servants abducted Sun-in-Shadow."
"204987124-0-47186";"All right. I'll pay Magister Gothren a visit."
"204987124-0-47187";"You're some kind of assassin?"
"204987124-0-47188";"Tell me more about Veya's mentor."
"204987124-0-47189";"No, I'm here about Veya."
"204987124-0-47190";"I'm trying to find her."
"204987124-0-47191";"I'll look for Veya's mentor in the ruins to the west."
"204987124-0-47194";"He kidnapped my friend."
"204987124-0-47197";"I came to see if can get the magister to release you."
"204987124-0-47199";"I'll go speak to him now."
"204987124-0-47200";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-47202";"If I do this, we're even? You'll release Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-47203";"Yes, he wanted you to view his memories."
"204987124-0-47206";"And if I refuse?"
"204987124-0-47208";"What exactly is his experiment?"
"204987124-0-47210";"I believe so."
"204987124-0-47212";"How did you acquire a memory stone?"
"204987124-0-47213";"Was that one of your children you were arguing with before we spoke?"
"204987124-0-47214";"You feel Neria resents you, too?"
"204987124-0-47215";"Tell me more about this memory stone."
"204987124-0-47216";"Why didn't you spend more time with your children?"
"204987124-0-47217";"Tell me more about this memory stone."
"204987124-0-47219";"We were in disguise, trying to make our escape from the ship."
"204987124-0-47221";"I'll go and talk to Governor Salvi."
"204987124-0-47223";"Tell me more about the hidden treasure."
"204987124-0-47224";"Tell me more about the hidden treasure."
"204987124-0-47226";"Why do you need me to collect these items?"
"204987124-0-47230";"Did you write a book about that adventure?"
"204987124-0-47231";"Elfbetta mentioned an old scroll."
"204987124-0-47233";"I'll get the fire salts and kindlepitch and meet you at the docks."
"204987124-0-47234";"What's special about this ruin?"
"204987124-0-47235";"Wait, Gothren is here?"
"204987124-0-47236";"You said you'd set Sun-in-Shadow free once I brought you the journal."
"204987124-0-47238";"Fine. I'll bring you the prism, then we're even."
"204987124-0-47240";"Not really."
"204987124-0-47241";"Do you know anything about this kwama mine? Zalkin-Sul?"
"204987124-0-47242";"So there's nothing noteworthy about this particular mine?"
"204987124-0-47243";"I just want to have a look around."
"204987124-0-47244";"Thanks for the warning. Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-47245";"Do you think the baby cliff striders will try to eat the royal egg?"
"204987124-0-47246";"Her father just wants to find her and know that she's safe."
"204987124-0-47247";"Your organization?"
"204987124-0-47248";"And the Orc you just killed?"
"204987124-0-47249";"Why do you care what happens to Veya?"
"204987124-0-47250";"If you love eggs so much why do you leave them in an unguarded open-air hatchery?"
"204987124-0-47251";"If you don't let me help, you'll have to deal with others. They're hiring outsiders to find Veya."
"204987124-0-47254";"Not us. Just me. But tell me, what happened to Veya's brother?"
"204987124-0-47259";"Where can I find Captain Brivan?"
"204987124-0-47260";"I guess that's a fair trade."
"204987124-0-47261";"Tell me more about this note you want me to follow."
"204987124-0-47262";"Tell me more about Veya's brother."
"204987124-0-47263";"How do you know Veya?"
"204987124-0-47264";"How do you know Veya?"
"204987124-0-47269";"This isn't how I expected our reunion to turn out."
"204987124-0-47272";"Is all that really true? Will you set up a meeting with Veya?"
"204987124-0-47273";"This isn't how I imagined our reunion turning out."
"204987124-0-47274";"Naryu said to call off the other freelancers or she'll take Veya and disappear."
"204987124-0-47275";"Your daughter is safe. Just let me handle this and I'll try to get her to meet with you."
"204987124-0-47281";"Why does Lord Vivec want you to contact your ancestor?"
"204987124-0-47287";"What do I do with this?"
"204987124-0-47288";"I'll try to decipher the map."
"204987124-0-47290";"Lord Vivec asks, ""Did Sotha Sil in his unending crusade know our divinity would shrivel and fade?"""
"204987124-0-47292";"Do all Dark Elves follow the Tribunal?"
"204987124-0-47295";"And how do I prove she can trust me?"
"204987124-0-47296";"She wants me to steal the House Redoran registry?"
"204987124-0-47298";"Steal the registry from Lord Drono's townhouse, got it."
"204987124-0-47299";"What does Lord Vivec hope to learn from the divination ritual?"
"204987124-0-47300";"Tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-47301";"Are you looking for gold to answer my questions?"
"204987124-0-47302";"How did he do it?"
"204987124-0-47303";"Why didn't you stop these breeding experiments?"
"204987124-0-47304";"Tell me more about this new breed of kwama."
"204987124-0-47305";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-47306";"So this new breed is unnatural then."
"204987124-0-47313";"All right, enough. We're even. Free Sun-in-Shadow and we'll leave."
"204987124-0-47314";"Good. Farewell."
"204987124-0-47315";"You probably want to watch yourself around some of these mages."
"204987124-0-47316";"A lot of mine workers, slaves, were killed or injured when I did what Gothren asked."
"204987124-0-47318";"So what's stopping the House from killing him this time?"
"204987124-0-47320";"Tell me about these new kwama."
"204987124-0-47322";"I have your reward."
"204987124-0-47323";"What do you know about Ald'ruhn?"
"204987124-0-47324";"I found this note in a hollow tree, along with a ruby that was her payment."
"204987124-0-47325";"So what do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-47326";"Do you think he's planning another escape?"
"204987124-0-47327";"We need you to sneak into the governor's private quarters and acquire a blank sheet of parchment."
"204987124-0-47329";"I'll talk to him."
"204987124-0-47330";"To fulfill your duty and maintain your honor."
"204987124-0-47331";"Who are the Ropefish?"
"204987124-0-47332";"We must acknowledge and celebrate the victories of life."
"204987124-0-47333";"Slavery."
"204987124-0-47335";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47337";"She'd like to know why you left your post at the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-47338";"I think things are going to get messy. You should get out of town."
"204987124-0-47339";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47340";"You think the governor is working with the slavers?"
"204987124-0-47341";"That's what it says in the registry."
"204987124-0-47343";"Where's Veya?"
"204987124-0-47344";"I'll go to the swamp and talk to Veya."
"204987124-0-47346";"And?"
"204987124-0-47347";"Why do you need me to collect these items?"
"204987124-0-47348";"Why do you need me to collect these items?"
"204987124-0-47349";"Can you tell me more about Nchuleft?"
"204987124-0-47350";"You've told me how this plan helps you, but how does it help Eoki?"
"204987124-0-47351";"You two seem pretty different."
"204987124-0-47352";"I'll deliver the payment to Atarga. Before I go, though, have some questions"
"204987124-0-47353";"Can you tell me about this Vassamsi Mine?"
"204987124-0-47354";"Were you ever sent there?"
"204987124-0-47355";"I know she cares about you."
"204987124-0-47356";"How can you afford to pay him?"
"204987124-0-47357";"Can you tell me about this Vassamsi Mine?"
"204987124-0-47358";"Can we trust the Ropefish to do their job?"
"204987124-0-47359";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-47360";"Why do you think the staff is important?"
"204987124-0-47361";"You really expect that strong a reaction just because Vivec's ill?"
"204987124-0-47362";"Do you really think this could lead to all-out war with the Ashlanders?"
"204987124-0-47363";"What then?"
"204987124-0-47365";"I was told to only deal with Atarga."
"204987124-0-47367";"Fine. I'll find Bothamul."
"204987124-0-47368";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-47369";"He and some others are planning another escape. It begins in the Vassamsi Mines."
"204987124-0-47371";"Be careful, Sun-in-Shadow."
"204987124-0-47372";"Of course. I hope it works out."
"204987124-0-47373";"Two of your people got her drunk and ambushed me on the way here."
"204987124-0-47374";"Politics."
"204987124-0-47375";"Be preserved at all costs."
"204987124-0-47376";"Outsiders must be welcomed and trusted completely."
"204987124-0-47378";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47379";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47380";"House Dres believes in a free market."
"204987124-0-47381";"I think we do. Farewell."
"204987124-0-47382";"Lead on and I'll follow you."
"204987124-0-47383";"Because Dres protects Morrowind with its strong army."
"204987124-0-47384";"Dres believes Dunmer should keep to themselves and focus on improving Morrowind."
"204987124-0-47386";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47387";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47388";"All right. I'll deal with the Warclaws. You get to the cave."
"204987124-0-47390";"I'll see you in the cave shortly."
"204987124-0-47393";"Succeed at business and turn a tidy profit."
"204987124-0-47394";"Always bargain from a position of strength."
"204987124-0-47395";"Revere Dunmer culture and resist all attempts to change."
"204987124-0-47397";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47398";"According to Captain Brivan, Ulran killed one of his own soldiers to protect an Ashlander."
"204987124-0-47399";"Can I try again?"
"204987124-0-47400";"Get behind me."
"204987124-0-47401";"Any idea where we can find these Ashlanders? They may be able to tell us about the incident."
"204987124-0-47403";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-47404";"So the back tunnels it is."
"204987124-0-47407";"What do the genealogies tell you?"
"204987124-0-47409";"The Failed Incarnates?"
"204987124-0-47410";"How does Rihnissi plan to knock them out?"
"204987124-0-47414";"And Azri just wants to kill them?"
"204987124-0-47416";"What was Rihnissi's suggestion?"
"204987124-0-47417";"Your father hired me to find you and set up a meeting. I might as well give him a progress report."
"204987124-0-47419";"Will you meet with your father after you find your brother?"
"204987124-0-47420";"Veya will meet with you, but on her own terms. All these soldiers have scared her away."
"204987124-0-47421";"Soon. She asked me to do one more thing and then she'll be ready to meet with you."
"204987124-0-47422";"I'll let her know."
"204987124-0-47424";"Do you think your brother and the Ashlanders are still here?"
"204987124-0-47425";"Stay out of the way of the Warclaws until I find out where your brother is."
"204987124-0-47426";"I'll look around and see what I can find."
"204987124-0-47428";"Where's Ulran now?"
"204987124-0-47429";"Tell me more about this mine."
"204987124-0-47430";"I'll get the key and locate Ulran."
"204987124-0-47433";"I found this speaking stone on Ulran's body."
"204987124-0-47434";"If it can shed light on what happened here, I say yes."
"204987124-0-47436";"<Continue to listen to Ulran's message.>"
"204987124-0-47437";"<Continue to listen to Ulran's message.>"
"204987124-0-47439";"<The message ends here.>"
"204987124-0-47441";"So what do we do next?"
"204987124-0-47443";"Tell me about the Morag Tong's rules."
"204987124-0-47444";"All the time."
"204987124-0-47445";"You're part of the Morag Tong too, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-47446";"You're part of the Morag Tong too, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-47447";"You mentioned trouble with House Redoran?"
"204987124-0-47448";"Do you always carry messages for Naryu Virian?"
"204987124-0-47449";"Your status is tenuous?"
"204987124-0-47450";"Well, thanks for trusting me with your secret hiding places."
"204987124-0-47451";"Do you know Veya's brother well?"
"204987124-0-47452";"Barilzar needs it to build something important, so tell me how to find the manual clockwork shaft."
"204987124-0-47454";"Why don't you work for Barilzar any more?"
"204987124-0-47455";"What's that about a steam trap?"
"204987124-0-47457";"So you don't know who put out the flame?"
"204987124-0-47459";"You left your notes in Arkngthunch-Sturdumz because of a few ghosts?"
"204987124-0-47461";"Tell me about these damned vampires."
"204987124-0-47463";"Findun's Special Blend?"
"204987124-0-47464";"Who did you see near the lighthouse that night?"
"204987124-0-47466";"Why did you stop working with Barilzar?"
"204987124-0-47469";"An Ordinator had you sabotage the lighthouse?"
"204987124-0-47471";"One more thing. How did you get past the guards?"
"204987124-0-47473";"I understand. I'll get another sheet of parchment from the governor's private quarters."
"204987124-0-47474";"Can't you just ask the governor to give you a few sheets?"
"204987124-0-47475";"So you want me to steal paper from the governor's office?"
"204987124-0-47477";"I can put the helmet back where I found it."
"204987124-0-47479";"Your son is dead. He was killed during the House Redoran raid on the Ashlander camp."
"204987124-0-47480";"Veya was with me. She confirmed it was her brother, Ulran."
"204987124-0-47481";"What else do you need me to do, Councilor?"
"204987124-0-47484";"Where can I find Farseer Kuamta?"
"204987124-0-47485";"Can I get more details on how you plan to teach Menaldinion a lesson?"
"204987124-0-47486";"I'll go gather the fresh moss."
"204987124-0-47487";"I'll go gather some fresh moss."
"204987124-0-47489";"Where's a good place to look?"
"204987124-0-47490";"I'll go gather some fresh moss."
"204987124-0-47491";"Why don't you trust Seryn?"
"204987124-0-47493";"Why does Vivec's condition threaten Vvardenfell?"
"204987124-0-47494";"Tell me about Baar Dau."
"204987124-0-47497";"I can provide a distraction."
"204987124-0-47499";"You need me to rescue the prisoners from the slavers."
"204987124-0-47503";"But what if I …?"
"204987124-0-47504";"No, just the ones you asked for. Let's go to Firemoth Island."
"204987124-0-47505";"The deputy governor seems like a harsh taskmaster."
"204987124-0-47506";"Let's go to Firemoth Island."
"204987124-0-47507";"I'll be sure to let her know."
"204987124-0-47513";"""And the ending of words is ALMSIVI."""
"204987124-0-47514";"A light flared and illuminated the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-47518";"We know where Barbas is going?"
"204987124-0-47519";"You said you disabled the defenses?"
"204987124-0-47520";"We know where Barbas is going?"
"204987124-0-47521";"Why don't you trust Seryn?"
"204987124-0-47526";"What should I look for?"
"204987124-0-47527";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-47529";"All right. I'll see what I can turn up."
"204987124-0-47530";"Do you think the Daedra will return to trouble you?"
"204987124-0-47531";"The Ashlanders control Ald'ruhn. How should he stake his claim?"
"204987124-0-47532";"Where should I start looking?"
"204987124-0-47534";"Rhea?"
"204987124-0-47535";"Because I need to know the circumstances surrounding his trial and exile."
"204987124-0-47536";"I don't think your anger is going to matter in a moment."
"204987124-0-47537";"Tested? Why was Ulran tested?"
"204987124-0-47544";"Should I let Veya know what we discovered first?"
"204987124-0-47545";"He called himself the Nerevarine. Do you know what that means?"
"204987124-0-47546";"Another scroll? Did Chodala write this?"
"204987124-0-47547";"I'll go talk to Veya."
"204987124-0-47550";"I don't think you should leave the safehouse until Naryu gets back."
"204987124-0-47552";"We also discovered that Captain Brivan might have had a role in Ulran's troubles."
"204987124-0-47553";"It was an Ashlander camp. How is that Redoran land?"
"204987124-0-47554";"Why not just let them use the land? They're nomads. They would have left eventually."
"204987124-0-47555";"It sounds like I need to talk to Captain Brivan. Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-47556";"Ulran left behind a speaking stone. His last message indicated that he planned to talk to Brivan."
"204987124-0-47557";"Did you order the attack on the Ashlander camp?"
"204987124-0-47558";"What did the councilor do?"
"204987124-0-47559";"What gave her away?"
"204987124-0-47560";"Why do you think Ulran was really exiled?"
"204987124-0-47561";"You think Ulran's death was all part of the plan?"
"204987124-0-47562";"You think Captain Brivan's involved in all this?"
"204987124-0-47563";"So you're accountable for Veya's actions?"
"204987124-0-47564";"Oracles of Azura?"
"204987124-0-47565";"Do you often receive writs that call for the death of high-ranking House officials?"
"204987124-0-47566";"Morag Tong rules are that stringent?"
"204987124-0-47569";"Very well. I'll seek out Azura."
"204987124-0-47571";"How's that go over with your dinner companions?"
"204987124-0-47572";"You said other oracles were abducted?"
"204987124-0-47573";"And Muz-Shah?"
"204987124-0-47574";"And you're certain they were abducted?"
"204987124-0-47575";"How often do you see visions of the future?"
"204987124-0-47576";"Can't you just rescue them yourself?"
"204987124-0-47577";"How do I collect Daedric essences?"
"204987124-0-47578";"How can I open these pockets of Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-47579";"Can you tell me more about this compact with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-47580";"What was the purpose of the summit?"
"204987124-0-47581";"Visions?"
"204987124-0-47582";"Tell me more about Chodala."
"204987124-0-47583";"You said Chodala wants to unite the tribes. Are you planning to go to war?"
"204987124-0-47584";"Are you always this hostile?"
"204987124-0-47586";"Why?"
"204987124-0-47590";"What kind of labors?"
"204987124-0-47592";"Do the other tribes believe this as well?"
"204987124-0-47595";"Can you tell me more about the compact you made with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-47598";"How would that work?"
"204987124-0-47601";"Tell me more about the Red Exiles."
"204987124-0-47602";"Doesn't being in the Morag Tong make such relationships difficult?"
"204987124-0-47603";"This place looks comfortable. Why hide Veya out in the swamp?"
"204987124-0-47604";"And you don't think Ulran could do something terrible enough to warrant exile?"
"204987124-0-47605";"Do you think she's in any danger?"
"204987124-0-47606";"This place looks comfortable. Why hide Veya out in the swamp?"
"204987124-0-47607";"What do you know about Ulran's exile?"
"204987124-0-47608";"Why don't you work with Barilzar any more?"
"204987124-0-47609";"What do you know about Ulran's exile?"
"204987124-0-47610";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-47613";"So you can't tell me any more about Rhea's vision or this Daedric storm?"
"204987124-0-47614";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-47615";"Stolen taxes I understand, but why the records?"
"204987124-0-47619";"Should we ask her to help?"
"204987124-0-47622";"How so?"
"204987124-0-47624";"Where is Nixxie now?"
"204987124-0-47629";"Why do you think he turned them down?"
"204987124-0-47630";"So he refused on moral grounds?"
"204987124-0-47631";"What is the Camonna Tong exactly?"
"204987124-0-47632";"They sound pretty dangerous."
"204987124-0-47636";"You said Khartag's an idiot. Why?"
"204987124-0-47637";"Acting lessons?"
"204987124-0-47638";"You said Khartag's an idiot. Why?"
"204987124-0-47640";"We'll just have to be careful then."
"204987124-0-47641";"What does that entail?"
"204987124-0-47644";"Why would Chodala seek refuge in a Daedric shrine?"
"204987124-0-47645";"Tell me more about Malacath."
"204987124-0-47646";"Could Malacath be involved in what's happening to Vivec?"
"204987124-0-47647";"Why would Chodala seek refuge in a Daedric shrine?"
"204987124-0-47648";"Why was Chodala inside a Daedric shrine?"
"204987124-0-47649";"Where can we find Chodala?"
"204987124-0-47651";"So you decided to help House Redoran?"
"204987124-0-47652";"I'm looking for Ulran. Do you know who that is?"
"204987124-0-47659";"I can help you escape."
"204987124-0-47663";"Nothing. I have no interest in owning a slave."
"204987124-0-47665";"Good luck, Tirwin."
"204987124-0-47666";"Not for long."
"204987124-0-47668";"It sounds like your brother was a good man."
"204987124-0-47670";"We'll find out who did this to him."
"204987124-0-47672";"Tell me about House Redoran."
"204987124-0-47673";"No ruse. I just want to know more about House Redoran."
"204987124-0-47674";"Tell me about House Redoran."
"204987124-0-47675";"Tell me about House Redoran."
"204987124-0-47676";"Take me to Gnisis."
"204987124-0-47679";"I'd like to go to Balmora."
"204987124-0-47681";"Is time really worth the price you paid?"
"204987124-0-47683";"Take me to Sadrith Mora, then."
"204987124-0-47685";"I doubt he'd be happy about it. Do you think he'll forgive you if you keep him a slave?"
"204987124-0-47688";"He wants to go home. If you love him, you should set him free."
"204987124-0-47690";"Yes. You should know she doesn't share your feelings."
"204987124-0-47692";"No. Tirwin really doesn't love you. All she wants is her freedom. I won't help you."
"204987124-0-47693";"Why does Veya want to go with Naryu?"
"204987124-0-47694";"Why does Veya want to go with Naryu?"
"204987124-0-47697";"As you wish, sire."
"204987124-0-47698";"And the agent that Veya admires?"
"204987124-0-47699";"But Naryu told you to stay here."
"204987124-0-47700";"And what were his demands?"
"204987124-0-47701";"Azura seems confident that another Daedric Prince is to blame."
"204987124-0-47702";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-47703";"Propylon chambers? What's that?"
"204987124-0-47705";"All right. Where can I find Naryu?"
"204987124-0-47708";"What can you tell me about Captain Brivan?"
"204987124-0-47709";"He didn't know and he seemed as upset as you are over the news."
"204987124-0-47711";"Daggerfall Covenant lands. Stros M'kai, please."
"204987124-0-47712";"I told your father what happened to Ulran."
"204987124-0-47713";"What did Brivan and Ulran argue about?"
"204987124-0-47717";"He told Ulran to go to the main land. He didn't expect him to turn to the Ashlanders for shelter."
"204987124-0-47718";"Have you given any thought to your brother's message?"
"204987124-0-47719";"Your father said you should avoid House Redoran until he can sort out what happened."
"204987124-0-47720";"Take me to Seyda Neen, then."
"204987124-0-47722";"Take me to Seyda Neen, then."
"204987124-0-47724";"Take me to Seyda Neen, then."
"204987124-0-47726";"Gnisis, please."
"204987124-0-47730";"That's perfect. Take me to Sadrith Mora."
"204987124-0-47732";"Take me to Sadrith Mora, then."
"204987124-0-47735";"You're some kind of assassin?"
"204987124-0-47742";"What would that entail?"
"204987124-0-47743";"I'd like to go to Tel Mora."
"204987124-0-47744";"As you wish, majesty."
"204987124-0-47748";"I'd like to go to Gnisis."
"204987124-0-47751";"I'd like to go to Seyda Neen."
"204987124-0-47755";"How did you gain this power? Did Azura give it to you?"
"204987124-0-47756";"I'd like to go to Vivec City."
"204987124-0-47759";"Where would I find these ingredients?"
"204987124-0-47760";"I'd like to go to Suran."
"204987124-0-47763";"I'd like to go to Gnisis."
"204987124-0-47766";"Understood."
"204987124-0-47768";"I'll find what you need, my king."
"204987124-0-47769";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-47770";"How do you know Azura will speak to me?"
"204987124-0-47771";"As you wish, majesty."
"204987124-0-47773";"What is Jester's Day?"
"204987124-0-47775";"Whimsy and mischief?"
"204987124-0-47777";"How do I join in?"
"204987124-0-47779";"What about the other Daedric Princes? Aren't there more than eight?"
"204987124-0-47781";"How do I collect Daedric essence?"
"204987124-0-47782";"Can you tell me more about this compact with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-47783";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-47785";"Why would the looters risk their own lives?"
"204987124-0-47787";"<Place the hand mirror.>"
"204987124-0-47795";"<Place the hand mirror.>"
"204987124-0-47800";"<Place the hand mirror.>"
"204987124-0-47801";"<Place the hand mirror.>"
"204987124-0-47810";"We should really wait for Naryu before we do anything rash."
"204987124-0-47812";"All right, we'll handle this your way. Any idea where we should look for the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-47813";"All right, I'll gather these cursed items. What will you do in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-47815";"All right, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-47817";"So you'll share credit for this discovery with Elfbetta?"
"204987124-0-47818";"What kind of records?"
"204987124-0-47822";"Won't the descendants of the Veloth line be angry that we're rummaging around in their tomb?"
"204987124-0-47824";"Doesn't anything you ""discover"" belong to them?"
"204987124-0-47829";"Who do you think was really behind all this?"
"204987124-0-47830";"So, I'm a Daedric agent?"
"204987124-0-47831";"Azura mentioned the compact of Sotha Sil again. What do you know about it?"
"204987124-0-47832";"Will I see you there? Wherever ""there"" is?"
"204987124-0-47833";"So I'll see her again?"
"204987124-0-47834";"Who do you think was really behind all this?"
"204987124-0-47835";"Any idea where I can find the key to your cage?"
"204987124-0-47840";"What kind of situation?"
"204987124-0-47841";"You said you were following orders? Who gave these orders?"
"204987124-0-47845";"Here's the key, but I want you to stay out of this. I'll deal with Veya."
"204987124-0-47846";"If you're so powerful, how did Sotha Sil convince you to join the compact?"
"204987124-0-47847";"We learned that Brivan gave the order that led to Ulran's banishment."
"204987124-0-47852";"She didn't harm you, did she?"
"204987124-0-47853";"As a hireling, do you still work for the Magisters?"
"204987124-0-47854";"You might want to seek shelter somewhere else. Veya left a trail of dead soldiers downstairs."
"204987124-0-47855";"Where is the council meeting you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-47858";"What about Barbas?"
"204987124-0-47859";"I'm not completely sure but it seemed to have something to do with Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-47860";"Why are people in a panic?"
"204987124-0-47861";"Where can I find Ninave Rendo?"
"204987124-0-47872";"So you'd consider it? I have a friend who is keen to buy up here."
"204987124-0-47873";"Why did you and your wife let him go off adventuring?"
"204987124-0-47875";"If I found out what happened to your son, would you be willing to sell?"
"204987124-0-47876";"Veya also left a trail of dead Redoran soldiers in the kinhouse."
"204987124-0-47877";"So you're protecting him by keeping him in chains?"
"204987124-0-47880";"I'll meet you at the garrison outside the city."
"204987124-0-47883";"We might have to fight our way through the mercenaries."
"204987124-0-47884";"How did you and Eoki meet?"
"204987124-0-47890";"Let's do this."
"204987124-0-47892";"I'll head downstairs and keep searching."
"204987124-0-47894";"What about your motives? Ulran's exile and death are on your head."
"204987124-0-47895";"Then who did? Tell me who's responsible for what happened to Ulran."
"204987124-0-47897";"What do you mean, destroy the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-47900";"I'm looking for a letter."
"204987124-0-47901";"That seems fair. Where is Ethrandora?"
"204987124-0-47902";"Why is it so important to get the poem back? It doesn't seem like a big deal."
"204987124-0-47903";"Why is it so important to get the poem back? It doesn't seem like a big deal."
"204987124-0-47904";"Blackmail? Over a poem? Really?"
"204987124-0-47905";"Why did you send her the poem in the first place?"
"204987124-0-47906";"Hide the ink when next you drink!"
"204987124-0-47907";"I thought the entire council was involved."
"204987124-0-47908";"House Redoran doesn't want the Ashlander territory?"
"204987124-0-47913";"And what do we have to do in exchange?"
"204987124-0-47914";"So what happens next?"
"204987124-0-47918";"You don't think you can convince her to go along with this?"
"204987124-0-47920";"So how do you want to handle this?"
"204987124-0-47923";"Veya deserves a second chance. We can worry about the rest later."
"204987124-0-47924";"How's life as a free woman?"
"204987124-0-47925";"How is Veya going to disappear?"
"204987124-0-47926";"Well, take care of yourself, Naryu."
"204987124-0-47927";"What's going to happen to you?"
"204987124-0-47931";"You upheld your vows and we stopped Veya before any other councilors were killed."
"204987124-0-47933";"At least we know what happened to Ulran. Justice was served."
"204987124-0-47934";"Well, take care of yourself, Naryu."
"204987124-0-47936";"How goes the plan to free Eoki?"
"204987124-0-47938";"If that's the case, are you sure you should be helping him?"
"204987124-0-47939";"As a hireling, do you still work for the Magisters?"
"204987124-0-47940";"What's happening at the shrine?"
"204987124-0-47943";"Did you work with Captain Ulran?"
"204987124-0-47947";"Why aren't you going in and disrupting the rituals?"
"204987124-0-47949";"Your techniques?"
"204987124-0-47953";"All right. I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-47954";"Storied Covenant heroes?"
"204987124-0-47956";"I'd like to know more about the Camonna Tong."
"204987124-0-47957";"I'd like to know more about the Camonna Tong."
"204987124-0-47958";"You said something about storied Covenant heroes?"
"204987124-0-47969";"Where can I find these hirelings of yours?"
"204987124-0-47970";"Can you tell me more about these components you need me to find?"
"204987124-0-47971";"Where can I find these hirelings of yours?"
"204987124-0-47972";"I'll go find some gear and the gate key."
"204987124-0-47973";"Any idea who these slavers are?"
"204987124-0-47974";"Why aren't the authorities clearing out the bandits?"
"204987124-0-47976";"What's special about these notes?"
"204987124-0-47977";"Why aren't the authorities clearing out the bandits?"
"204987124-0-47978";"Who is the Gerald you keep talking to?"
"204987124-0-47980";"The others?"
"204987124-0-47981";"I don't see anyone."
"204987124-0-47982";"Just one more thing. What do you plan to do with the land?"
"204987124-0-47984";"Can you tell me more about this breed of kwama?"
"204987124-0-47985";"Is there a queen kwama in this mine?"
"204987124-0-47986";"Can you tell me more about this breed of kwama?"
"204987124-0-47991";"Do you have any advice I can give Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-47992";"What's the real story behind the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-47993";"It seems that Ralasa Delvi is particularly opposed to Sun-in-Shadow."
"204987124-0-47994";"Do you have any advice I can give Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-47995";"If you are so free with advice, what would you advise Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-48002";"Why do you hate Argonians and Khajiit so much?"
"204987124-0-48003";"If you are so free with advice, what would you advise Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-48004";"Narsis Dren?"
"204987124-0-48005";"Why do you think they abandoned you?"
"204987124-0-48006";"What do the Investigator Vale books have to do with all this?"
"204987124-0-48008";"What do you think about the other information we found?"
"204987124-0-48010";"And that all means …?"
"204987124-0-48011";"Spiders took the other mages?"
"204987124-0-48012";"Who tested Ulran? And who killed him?"
"204987124-0-48013";"Do you know a man named Stibbons? Have you seen him?"
"204987124-0-48015";"Stay here. I'll examine Stibbons's spice pouch and see if I can pick up his trail."
"204987124-0-48016";"I'm not leaving until you tell me why Ulran had to die."
"204987124-0-48021";"You seem to be able to do what you want as a retainer. Is the oathman rank so important?"
"204987124-0-48022";"Do you really think he's going to listen to me?"
"204987124-0-48024";"Oh, nothing. I was just curious. Now, weren't we about to get to know each other a little better?"
"204987124-0-48028";"What did the thieves steal from Magister Gothren?"
"204987124-0-48029";"So would they be doubly punished if they were returned?"
"204987124-0-48030";"I am not a slave trader."
"204987124-0-48031";"How did thieves manage to get into Tel Aruhn to steal things?"
"204987124-0-48032";"How did thieves manage to get into Tel Aruhn to steal things?"
"204987124-0-48033";"What did the thieves steal from Magister Gothren?"
"204987124-0-48037";"What's the real story behind the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-48040";"That's one of the mages working for Lady Laurent?"
"204987124-0-48041";"Don't leave yet. Let me talk to this mage, first."
"204987124-0-48042";"Dark? So the spider attacked you?"
"204987124-0-48044";"I found two of them. One ran into the ruins ranting about spiders. I couldn't follow her, though."
"204987124-0-48045";"There was a magical barrier. I couldn't pass through it."
"204987124-0-48048";"I'll get a small spider and meet you at camp."
"204987124-0-48049";"What's the real story behind the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-48051";"Can Barbas actually use Vivec's energy to open a portal?"
"204987124-0-48052";"Can Barbas actually use Vivec's energy to open a portal?"
"204987124-0-48053";"Tell me more about the atelier."
"204987124-0-48057";"Veya's brother killed a Redoran soldier?"
"204987124-0-48058";"Who are Ferhara's Warclaws?"
"204987124-0-48059";"What is it you want from me?"
"204987124-0-48060";"But you're an Orc."
"204987124-0-48061";"Does the queen know you're impersonating her?"
"204987124-0-48062";"How does throwing these petals at people help with the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-48063";"Does the queen know you're impersonating her?"
"204987124-0-48064";"Scrolls from a Daedric ruin? Sounds dangerous."
"204987124-0-48066";"You really want Stibbons to examine a Daedric scroll?"
"204987124-0-48067";"I want you to know, I'm not happy with this arrangement."
"204987124-0-48068";"Just what is an illusion dazzler?"
"204987124-0-48069";"What's the real story behind the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-48070";"Anything I should look out for down there?"
"204987124-0-48071";"Mzanchend?"
"204987124-0-48072";"What exactly are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-48073";"What exactly are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-48074";"I can handle that."
"204987124-0-48078";"Does King Jorunn know you're impersonating him?"
"204987124-0-48079";"Does King Jorunn know you're impersonating him?"
"204987124-0-48080";"You're a Khajiit."
"204987124-0-48081";"You aren't really going to wed that pig, are you?"
"204987124-0-48082";"But you are an Argonian."
"204987124-0-48083";"What's the real story behind the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-48087";"What is it you need?"
"204987124-0-48088";"Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-48090";"I'll find them, Gilan."
"204987124-0-48093";"I helped him recover memories from his younger days."
"204987124-0-48094";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-48096";"Your father works with the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-48098";"Your father is fine, but he and your brother had an argument."
"204987124-0-48099";"Mils said your father worked with the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-48100";"What type of work does your father do?"
"204987124-0-48101";"Mils said your father worked with the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-48102";"He also said this was about your inheritance."
"204987124-0-48104";"Doesn't your sister deserve your support?"
"204987124-0-48106";"Can you tell me about this Vassamsi Mine?"
"204987124-0-48107";"Do you share your brother's feelings about your father's absence?"
"204987124-0-48108";"Mils said your father worked with the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-48109";"Yes. Here's the payment, as promised."
"204987124-0-48112";"You're principled for a vampire."
"204987124-0-48113";"Be careful what you wish for."
"204987124-0-48115";"Do you know where I can find this ""Ruddy Man"" now?"
"204987124-0-48118";"Not if I can help it."
"204987124-0-48120";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-48122";"I'll go to Arenim Manor and see if we can delay Naryu's kill long enough to learn anything."
"204987124-0-48125";"Why didn't Vatola stand up for Ulran at his trial?"
"204987124-0-48127";"""Blood will flow?"" Don't you need a writ to kill someone?"
"204987124-0-48128";"I thought Naryu was responsible for your actions?"
"204987124-0-48129";"Don't force me to choose between you and Naryu."
"204987124-0-48130";"Do you know Vatola Telem?"
"204987124-0-48131";"Your Master's grandest plan?"
"204987124-0-48132";"Why go to all this trouble just to get into the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-48133";"Your Master's grandest plan?"
"204987124-0-48137";"Your Master's grandest plan?"
"204987124-0-48138";"Very well, I'll find and kill this thing. Ruddy Man or not."
"204987124-0-48146";"Do you often receive writs that call for the death of high-ranking House officials?"
"204987124-0-48147";"Three of you? You mentioned another priest …."
"204987124-0-48148";"I can go to the tomb and help Canon Llevule."
"204987124-0-48151";"How do we get into the garrison?"
"204987124-0-48152";"This whole thing started as a test of Ulran's loyalty?"
"204987124-0-48153";"I hear your reign has been difficult for many of Vos's citizens."
"204987124-0-48155";"So it's true. You're abusing the people of Vos."
"204987124-0-48156";"And one of his subordinates is supposed to attend a secret meeting."
"204987124-0-48158";"I could try to meet with Nerandas instead."
"204987124-0-48159";"Tell me more about your group here."
"204987124-0-48160";"So we're poisoning the Tel Mora mushroom?"
"204987124-0-48164";"Has your employer given you any information that might help us with this job?"
"204987124-0-48165";"Special connection to the realm of the dead?"
"204987124-0-48166";"Can you tell me more about the job?"
"204987124-0-48167";"I've almost died lots of times."
"204987124-0-48171";"Are you going to write about this in your next book?"
"204987124-0-48173";"Calm down. What's gotten in to you?"
"204987124-0-48177";"Any idea where Veloth tomb is located?"
"204987124-0-48179";"Is there a reason to be worried?"
"204987124-0-48188";"Fine. I'll get you a bucket of Findun's Special Blend."
"204987124-0-48190";"Disappear? Like Stibbons and the mages?"
"204987124-0-48191";"Tell me more about these mages."
"204987124-0-48193";"Call out your soldiers. I'll take this ship and head to the island."
"204987124-0-48194";"So the people would like to see her recover?"
"204987124-0-48195";"What more can you tell me about Savarak?"
"204987124-0-48196";"You mentioned treasure?"
"204987124-0-48200";"What's so special about the Bal Fell ruins?"
"204987124-0-48209";"Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-48214";"Aren't you worried about your sister?"
"204987124-0-48215";"What killed the Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-48217";"What are you proposing?"
"204987124-0-48218";"You're coming with me? All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-48219";"How do we get a spirit in here?"
"204987124-0-48221";"But the skaafin can't get inside, right?"
"204987124-0-48222";"You need to help me fight these things."
"204987124-0-48225";"See you there."
"204987124-0-48226";"And Farwen, his prisoner, does she still live?"
"204987124-0-48227";"How do I banish Galgalah?"
"204987124-0-48229";"I still have questions, but if you must, be gone."
"204987124-0-48230";"The ruin with a lava path and stone bridge."
"204987124-0-48232";"What about you? What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48233";"No, stay with me. You have to fight him. You're the only one who can."
"204987124-0-48234";"What other choice do we have?"
"204987124-0-48236";"If that's what you wish, I'll do it."
"204987124-0-48239";"Where are the others?"
"204987124-0-48240";"I'm sorry it ended like this."
"204987124-0-48244";"Farwen told you Galgalah was banished?"
"204987124-0-48246";"I'm glad I could help."
"204987124-0-48249";"So you're not organizing the expedition?"
"204987124-0-48258";"What do you hope to find here?"
"204987124-0-48260";"Believe me when I say there's hope for any soul in his thrall."
"204987124-0-48261";"You believe Molag Bal can offer you a cure?"
"204987124-0-48262";"You believe Molag Bal can offer you a cure?"
"204987124-0-48263";"How can you not revel in this power we possess? Why would you seek a cure?"
"204987124-0-48264";"What kind of resistance can I expect?"
"204987124-0-48265";"What kind of resistance can I expect?"
"204987124-0-48266";"Stolen taxes I understand, but why the records?"
"204987124-0-48267";"Especially if Veya finds out that her father set all this in motion."
"204987124-0-48268";"I pried my soul from the clutches of Molag Bal. A few minor Daedra won't trouble me."
"204987124-0-48269";"Why aren't you going in and disrupting the rituals?"
"204987124-0-48270";"What's happening at the shrine?"
"204987124-0-48271";"Will disrupting the rituals be enough to stop the Worm Cult?"
"204987124-0-48272";"What's happening at the shrine?"
"204987124-0-48273";"I'll think about it."
"204987124-0-48274";"Careful how you talk about Orcs. Let me think about this."
"204987124-0-48275";"So you were trying to take control of Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-48277";"No thanks, I think I'll find my own way out of here."
"204987124-0-48278";"Do you have any plans for Vos now that Savarak is dead?"
"204987124-0-48279";"But the people seemed so anxious for you to return."
"204987124-0-48280";"What exactly are these Stones of Cold Fire?"
"204987124-0-48281";"So that's it? You just leave them alone?"
"204987124-0-48282";"Duly noted."
"204987124-0-48283";"Duly noted."
"204987124-0-48286";"Duly noted."
"204987124-0-48287";"Duly noted."
"204987124-0-48288";"And you never bothered to check out the tree?"
"204987124-0-48289";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-48292";"What's in this bag?"
"204987124-0-48293";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-48295";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-48298";"Why so interested in a haunted tomb?"
"204987124-0-48299";"Aren't the spirits of historic significance as well?"
"204987124-0-48300";"Why so interested in a haunted tomb?"
"204987124-0-48301";"""ALMSIVI is the ending of words."""
"204987124-0-48303";"I'm going to speak to Magister Gothren now."
"204987124-0-48304";"And if I refuse?"
"204987124-0-48305";"You seem to be able to do what you want as a retainer. Is the oathman rank so important?"
"204987124-0-48306";"You sent them in alone? I was hired to protect them."
"204987124-0-48307";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-48308";"So they have no idea what they're up against?"
"204987124-0-48311";"He lures others in? Is it possible Lord Thanlen is Galgalah?"
"204987124-0-48312";"Anything I should look out for down there?"
"204987124-0-48313";"Is there a way to stop this Galgalah?"
"204987124-0-48315";"Did the prism come from inside Mzanchend?"
"204987124-0-48316";"Where can I find the parts?"
"204987124-0-48317";"Where can I find the parts?"
"204987124-0-48318";"And you have no idea what this device does?"
"204987124-0-48321";"How did you come to have a key to Mzanchend?"
"204987124-0-48322";"Glad to hear it. Now I need to get this prism unlocked."
"204987124-0-48324";"I'll use Sunna'rah on Vile's statue."
"204987124-0-48326";"Did the prism come from inside Mzanchend?"
"204987124-0-48328";"I still have questions, but if you must, be gone."
"204987124-0-48329";"Very well. I'll be on the lookout for Nixxie."
"204987124-0-48330";"How does that help Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-48331";"I'll think it over."
"204987124-0-48332";"How did thieves manage to get into Tel Aruhn to steal things?"
"204987124-0-48334";"All right. I'm going in."
"204987124-0-48336";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-48338";"Fine then."
"204987124-0-48340";"I'll go now."
"204987124-0-48341";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-48342";"Of course."
"204987124-0-48343";"I'll tell Gothren I couldn't find you. Good luck."
"204987124-0-48345";"Actually, she said I could keep the payment."
"204987124-0-48347";"If you are so free with advice, what would you advise Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-48356";"Tell me about Capture the Relic."
"204987124-0-48358";"Tell me about something else."
"204987124-0-48359";"Tell me about Deathmatch."
"204987124-0-48363";"All right, lets do this."
"204987124-0-48365";"Because Galgalah is still with you and that's dangerous."
"204987124-0-48369";"The Eight? I thought you worshiped the Old Gods?"
"204987124-0-48371";"How do I get to Sadrith Mora?"
"204987124-0-48373";"Red Mountain?"
"204987124-0-48374";"All right. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-48375";"All right. I'm ready"
"204987124-0-48376";"I hope you find her soon."
"204987124-0-48378";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-48380";"Do you really think you can change her mind?"
"204987124-0-48382";"Do you think you might convince him to change his mind?"
"204987124-0-48384";"I'll let you get back to it."
"204987124-0-48389";"Thanks for the warning. Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-48390";"Do you like … sort of working here?"
"204987124-0-48392";"Crank, gear, piston, handle. Got it. I've got a few more questions."
"204987124-0-48393";"Aren't you worried about your sister?"
"204987124-0-48394";"Aren't you worried about your sister?"
"204987124-0-48395";"Is it that surprising?"
"204987124-0-48396";"Things?"
"204987124-0-48397";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-48398";"How did a Nereid wreck a ship?"
"204987124-0-48399";"Can you tell me about the sailors protecting the Nereid?"
"204987124-0-48400";"Can you tell me about the sailors protecting the Nereid?"
"204987124-0-48401";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-48403";"I'll go talk to Veya."
"204987124-0-48404";"Tell me about your master."
"204987124-0-48405";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-48406";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-48407";"Will you ever set him free?"
"204987124-0-48409";"Your husband?"
"204987124-0-48410";"You did try to hold her against her will too."
"204987124-0-48413";"How so?"
"204987124-0-48414";"Can you tell me anything else that may help me find Veya?"
"204987124-0-48415";"This place seems to take a toll on everyone."
"204987124-0-48417";"What was the argument about?"
"204987124-0-48418";"Are you somebody important?"
"204987124-0-48419";"What do you think Veya is going to do?"
"204987124-0-48420";"Why do you think the people are going to panic?"
"204987124-0-48421";"What is a fabricant?"
"204987124-0-48422";"Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-48423";"No, I'm actually a fan of your writings."
"204987124-0-48424";"Do you know where this rift leads?"
"204987124-0-48425";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-48426";"You mentioned constructs. What kind?"
"204987124-0-48427";"I'll follow your lead."
"204987124-0-48428";"You mentioned constructs. What kind?"
"204987124-0-48429";"You mentioned constructs. What kind?"
"204987124-0-48430";"You mentioned constructs. What kind?"
"204987124-0-48431";"What happened to the miners?"
"204987124-0-48432";"How did the kwama get to be such a problem?"
"204987124-0-48433";"How did the kwama get to be such a problem?"
"204987124-0-48435";"What are you researching?"
"204987124-0-48436";"What's so special about these mushrooms?"
"204987124-0-48437";"What's so special about these mushrooms?"
"204987124-0-48438";"Focus on what?"
"204987124-0-48439";"What's next, Sun-in-Shadow?"
"204987124-0-48441";"I can understand that. He's not a person you want to cross once, let alone twice."
"204987124-0-48443";"So they got away?"
"204987124-0-48445";"I'm surprised he hasn't tried to escape yet."
"204987124-0-48446";"Was there any word on Eoki or his friends?"
"204987124-0-48447";"Was this thing the cause of the rift?"
"204987124-0-48448";"Why didn't you open a portal earlier?"
"204987124-0-48449";"Why didn't you open a portal earlier?"
"204987124-0-48450";"How do I talk to the spirits of the Incarnates?"
"204987124-0-48451";"Remind me, what's the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-48453";"Do you believe that?"
"204987124-0-48454";"Can you remind me about what I've learned so far?"
"204987124-0-48455";"Your husband seems to have a different view of honor."
"204987124-0-48456";"Anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-48457";"Can you tell me anything about Ulran's exile?"
"204987124-0-48459";"Sotha Sil's tool, is it a weapon?"
"204987124-0-48460";"Does your husband know you're leaving?"
"204987124-0-48462";"What can you tell me of the current status of things?"

"204987124-0-48477";"What's special about this ruin?"
"204987124-0-48478";"Let's go to Seyda Neen then!"
"204987124-0-48479";"On to Vivec City, then!"
"204987124-0-48482";"Can you tell me more about Dubdil Alar?"

"204987124-0-48484";"Can you tell me more about Dubdil Alar?"
"204987124-0-48485";"Do you notice anything else?"
"204987124-0-48486";"What does all this have to do with Stibbons and the missing mages?"
"204987124-0-48488";"Sounds like a plan."
"204987124-0-48489";"Ambushes? You've been attacked before?"
"204987124-0-48491";"The Armigers only sent me to find proof you attacked the pilgrims. I just didn't avoid a conflict."
"204987124-0-48492";"You've been making blood sacrifices; I need to know the pilgrims weren't among them."
"204987124-0-48493";"Fine. I'll investigate your claims."
"204987124-0-48494";"What is it you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-48495";"Why meet at Helan Tomb?"
"204987124-0-48496";"If you don't let me help, you'll have to deal with others. They're hiring outsiders to find Veya."
"204987124-0-48497";"What would I need to do?"
"204987124-0-48499";"I'll speak with them."
"204987124-0-48510";"What's wrong with the miners?"
"204987124-0-48511";"Have you heard this music the miners are talking about?"
"204987124-0-48513";"Why is Artisan Lenarmen trying to abduct you?"
"204987124-0-48514";"Do you think the Heart is here?"
"204987124-0-48515";"Do we know the source of this mysterious assault?"
"204987124-0-48517";"Sotha Sil created something to hurt Vivec?"
"204987124-0-48518";"All right. I'll help you search."
"204987124-0-48519";"Tell me about the workers who are still missing."
"204987124-0-48520";"I'd like to know more about the Camonna Tong."
"204987124-0-48525";"Why aren't the authorities clearing out the bandits?"
"204987124-0-48542";"So they all keep Argonians as slaves?"
"204987124-0-48543";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-48544";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-48545";"Isn't there still a risk in this plan of yours?"
"204987124-0-48547";"Where is Naryu sending you?"
"204987124-0-48548";"Well, good luck to you, Veya."
"204987124-0-48551";"Is there a queen kwama in this mine?"
"204987124-0-48552";"She said she belonged here. It was her birthright."
"204987124-0-48553";"Why are people in a panic?"
"204987124-0-48554";"What are you offering, exactly?"
"204987124-0-48555";"And what do I do to participate?"
"204987124-0-48560";"Where else can I find recipes?"
"204987124-0-48561";"Is there anywhere I can purchase ingredients?"
"204987124-0-48562";"How can provisioning benefit me?"
"204987124-0-48563";"What is the difference between cooking and brewing?"
"204987124-0-48565";"Is there anywhere I can purchase recipes?"
"204987124-0-48571";"Tell me more about the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-48572";"And who's Clavicus Vile?"
"204987124-0-48573";"But isn't Azura a god?"
"204987124-0-48574";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-48575";"Forge of the future?"
"204987124-0-48576";"Tell me more about Barbas."
"204987124-0-48577";"Lord Vivec mentioned the Clockwork City's wards."
"204987124-0-48578";"Lord Vivec mentioned the Clockwork City's wards."
"204987124-0-48579";"You did your best. Veya's own grief led to her downfall."
"204987124-0-48580";"You know you can tell me anything."
"204987124-0-48582";"You used to work for the Gold Coast Trading Company?"
"204987124-0-48583";"So you like working for the Dark Elves?"
"204987124-0-48585";"All right."
"204987124-0-48586";"What does the note say?"
"204987124-0-48587";"What makes you so certain that's where they are?"
"204987124-0-48589";"Why is House Redoran denouncing them then?"
"204987124-0-48590";"Who are the Morag Tong again?"
"204987124-0-48592";"Keep up the faith."
"204987124-0-48593";"Choice it is."
"204987124-0-48597";"What have you learned?"
"204987124-0-48600";"You're sure the entrance to the Clockwork City is down here?"
"204987124-0-48602";"What do you think it means?"
"204987124-0-48603";"Skills: Make a donation"
"204987124-0-48606";"Attributes: Make a donation"
"204987124-0-48607";"Tell me more about Traylan Omoril's requests."
"204987124-0-48608";"Tell me more about Beleru Omoril's requests."
"204987124-0-48609";"Tell me more about Beleru Omoril's requests."
"204987124-0-48614";"And we saved the Redoran councilors here in Vvardenfell."
"204987124-0-48616";"We stopped the song. You're safe."
"204987124-0-48619";"Who are the priests of St. Alessia?"
"204987124-0-48621";"My mistake."
"204987124-0-48623";"What were you asked to do?"
"204987124-0-48626";"Because your beautiful nose needed the help."
"204987124-0-48628";"Were you injured?"
"204987124-0-48629";"Why bring your dog then?"
"204987124-0-48631";"Are you here by yourself?"
"204987124-0-48634";"With the Ashlanders leaving and the dreugh problem contained, you aren't missing much."
"204987124-0-48635";"Do you get a lot of visitors out here?"
"204987124-0-48637";"And I assume that would be bad?"
"204987124-0-48639";"But the skaafin can't get inside, right?"
"204987124-0-48640";"Tell me about Pelinal Whitestrake."
"204987124-0-48641";"Who are the priests of St. Alessia?"
"204987124-0-48642";"Tell me about Pelinal Whitestrake."
"204987124-0-48643";"Who are the priests of St. Alessia?"
"204987124-0-48644";"Is there anything I should know about the ship that crashed?"
"204987124-0-48645";"Why do you suspect slavers?"
"204987124-0-48646";"So slavery is illegal here?"
"204987124-0-48647";"Is there anything I should know about the ship that crashed?"
"204987124-0-48648";"Is there anything I should know about the ship that crashed?"
"204987124-0-48651";"If Barbas can use Vivec's energy, do we really stand a chance against him?"
"204987124-0-48653";"I still need to think about it."
"204987124-0-48656";"Tell me about the statue you found."
"204987124-0-48657";"Can you tell me anything else about the siblings?"
"204987124-0-48658";"Can you tell me anything else about the siblings?"
"204987124-0-48660";"Yes?"
"204987124-0-48666";"Isn't Vivec busy with his city?"
"204987124-0-48668";"Then why the disguise?"
"204987124-0-48671";"Are you here by yourself?"
"204987124-0-48672";"Are you worried the miners might still suffer from the song?"
"204987124-0-48673";"What about you? Are you staying here?"
"204987124-0-48675";"I wish you luck then."
"204987124-0-48676";"Does that mean you'll have more potions available?"
"204987124-0-48677";"Which Dunmer?"
"204987124-0-48679";"What happened to Manore, anyways?"
"204987124-0-48687";"What's so special about the Bal Fell ruins?"
"204987124-0-48688";"But why is the Clockwork City inside a globe?"
"204987124-0-48690";"Maybe it had something to do with the spiders that were talking to her."
"204987124-0-48691";"About that …."
"204987124-0-48692";"Good luck, Theyo."
"204987124-0-48693";"Farwen's containing him, for now, but there may be a time where she can't any longer."
"204987124-0-48694";"What do you hope to discover?"
"204987124-0-48695";"You know how to operate that terminal?"
"204987124-0-48696";"You know how to operate that terminal?"
"204987124-0-48698";"You mentioned Veya might be involved in something dangerous?"
"204987124-0-48700";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48702";"And what bargain do you plan to make?"
"204987124-0-48703";"I should have been told what I was helping you to do."
"204987124-0-48704";"How is her bargain going to help the ""greater good?"""
"204987124-0-48708";"Do you know when you'll be taken to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-48709";"Do you have any plans for Vos now that Savarak is dead?"
"204987124-0-48710";"You seem pretty calm about this."
"204987124-0-48711";"Galgalah is trapped inside Farwen. It was the only way to save her life."
"204987124-0-48713";"I can deliver a message, but what is this distraction you're talking about?"
"204987124-0-48714";"I'll seek them out."
"204987124-0-48715";"I'll seek them out."
"204987124-0-48716";"I'll seek them out."
"204987124-0-48717";"I was just traveling through the area."
"204987124-0-48719";"Tell me what happened to Veya."
"204987124-0-48720";"Tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-48721";"Tell me more about Veya Releth."
"204987124-0-48722";"And that's why Veya ran away?"
"204987124-0-48723";"Councilor Eris secured my services to locate his daughter."
"204987124-0-48724";"You let her join the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-48725";"Why does House Redoran want to shut down the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-48726";"I suppose I should let Councilor Eris know about his son."
"204987124-0-48727";"Any advice on how I should approach Veya?"
"204987124-0-48728";"I can get inside and try to talk to her."
"204987124-0-48729";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-48731";"Divisible by three?"
"204987124-0-48733";"Would Divayth Fyr actually vaporize you for a late shipment?"
"204987124-0-48734";"What's so special about these mushrooms?"
"204987124-0-48735";"Would Divayth Fyr actually vaporize you for a late shipment?"
"204987124-0-48736";"I'll find you."
"204987124-0-48739";"She didn't harm you?"
"204987124-0-48741";"Tell me more."
"204987124-0-48742";"Tell me about the ruins."
"204987124-0-48743";"Tell me about the ruins."
"204987124-0-48744";"Tell me about who I'm working with."
"204987124-0-48745";"You're sure the entrance to the Clockwork City is down here?"
"204987124-0-48746";"What was Clavicus Vile hoping to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-48747";"Why do you think Azura decided to help us?"
"204987124-0-48748";"What was Clavicus Vile hoping to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-48749";"What was Clavicus Vile hoping to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-48750";"Why did Sotha Sil create Sunna'rah?"
"204987124-0-48751";"Has Azura told you anything else?"
"204987124-0-48753";"What did you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-48755";"Perhaps there's another way?"
"204987124-0-48756";"You want me to acquire the staff called Sunna'rah?"
"204987124-0-48760";"Tell me about Team Deathmatch."
"204987124-0-48762";"Tell me about Domination."
"204987124-0-48763";"Tell me about Capture the Relic."
"204987124-0-48772";"Why can't we just place the wards down somewhere safer?"
"204987124-0-48774";"Well, we need to hurry. There's a body shifter out here."
"204987124-0-48775";"Take me to Elden Root in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-48782";"Actually, I've been hired to protect your outfit. Theyo sent me to help you place your wards."
"204987124-0-48783";"When I've secured them all I'll let them know."
"204987124-0-48785";"Do you know anything of his plans?"
"204987124-0-48786";"Who is Galchobhar?"
"204987124-0-48787";"These are the weapons the Reachmen are making at the Forge?"
"204987124-0-48788";"What is the red stone they were forcing you to mine?"
"204987124-0-48789";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-48790";"It sounds like they are preparing for something, do you know anything of their plans?"
"204987124-0-48791";"Tell me about Chaos Ball."
"204987124-0-48792";"These are the weapons the Reachmen are making at the Forge?"
"204987124-0-48794";"Dead? I don't know yet. He left this note."
"204987124-0-48796";"Falkreath is a refuge?"
"204987124-0-48797";"You shouldn't have followed me. You're lucky to be alive."
"204987124-0-48798";"Falkreath is a refuge?"
"204987124-0-48801";"That's extreme, don't you think?"
"204987124-0-48802";"That isn't a good idea. This place should stay buried."
"204987124-0-48803";"Lay down those weapons, before you head down a path there's no returning from."
"204987124-0-48804";"What are you planning?"
"204987124-0-48805";"What are you planning?"
"204987124-0-48806";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-48807";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-48808";"What are you planning?"
"204987124-0-48809";"What are you planning?"
"204987124-0-48810";"There are two tombs?"
"204987124-0-48813";"This is unusual then?"
"204987124-0-48814";"Why rally at the Hall of the Dead?"
"204987124-0-48818";"What others? What were you looking into?"
"204987124-0-48821";"I'll warn your friends."
"204987124-0-48822";"What exactly did you find?"
"204987124-0-48823";"And you're sure that Skaldir's death is related to this artifact?"
"204987124-0-48824";"What brought you here?"
"204987124-0-48825";"What did you and Skaldir discover that was so terrible?"
"204987124-0-48826";"Why can't you warn the others yourself?"
"204987124-0-48827";"What did you and Skaldir discover that was so terrible?"
"204987124-0-48828";"Bonafryd sent me to warn him. His life may be in danger."
"204987124-0-48829";"I'll find him."
"204987124-0-48830";"I hope so. Someone has been killing his associates in the Order of the Eye."
"204987124-0-48833";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-48834";"Bonafryd sent me. She thinks these attacks have to do with the artifact you were studying."
"204987124-0-48836";"Thank you. Stay safe."
"204987124-0-48837";"If I were here to kill you, you'd be dead already. Now, stop being an idiot and come out of there."
"204987124-0-48838";"Bonafryd sent me. She wants you to seek a safe place. You should go to your sister."
"204987124-0-48840";"Fine. I'll go talk to Xarei."
"204987124-0-48841";"It's not that. I've come to warn him. His shadow may be trying to kill him, but he won't listen."
"204987124-0-48843";"Follow me."
"204987124-0-48844";"Stay close to your sister. You'll be all right."
"204987124-0-48846";"I will keep your notes safe. Good luck."
"204987124-0-48848";"Where are these objects?"
"204987124-0-48850";"All right. But before I do this, I have questions."
"204987124-0-48851";"Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-48852";"What do you plan to do with this lantern and the lens?"
"204987124-0-48853";"If that's true, why aren't you on Artaeum now?"
"204987124-0-48854";"What's an Obscuros?"
"204987124-0-48855";"Where is this device now?"
"204987124-0-48856";"Are they dangerous?"
"204987124-0-48857";"Just your boat?"
"204987124-0-48858";"A spooring what? Explain yourself."
"204987124-0-48859";"You're right. Let's finish this investigation together."
"204987124-0-48862";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-48864";"I'll be fine. I'm going alone."
"204987124-0-48866";"I'll be fine."
"204987124-0-48867";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-48943";"Remake Tamriel? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-48944";"So if someone took over Clockwork City, they could change or even destroy Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-48946";"So what do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-48947";"But the people seemed so anxious for you to return."
"204987124-0-48948";"Are you not frightened of what is to come?"
"204987124-0-48949";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-48950";"What's it mean to be a Thane?"
"204987124-0-48951";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-48952";"Why rally at the Hall of the Dead?"
"204987124-0-48953";"I guess Bonafryd was a powerful mage after all."
"204987124-0-48955";"What can you tell me about him?"
"204987124-0-48956";"Will you be all right out here with those wounds?"
"204987124-0-48957";"Who is this Eerika you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-48958";"What's being a Thane entail, exactly?"
"204987124-0-48959";"How so?"
"204987124-0-48960";"You're going to defend this spot by yourself?"
"204987124-0-48961";"I thought this place was supposed to be safe."
"204987124-0-48962";"Glad to see you survived."
"204987124-0-48963";"Glad to see you survived."
"204987124-0-48965";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48966";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48967";"And who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-48968";"Why do you think this one is so good at hiding from you?"
"204987124-0-48969";"Isn't here?"
"204987124-0-48970";"What do you plan to do with this lantern and lens?"
"204987124-0-48971";"I want to know why Terari was cast out."
"204987124-0-48972";"Why go through with it then?"
"204987124-0-48973";"It's a risk he seems willing to take. He said he'd do whatever he could to make things right."
"204987124-0-48978";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-48979";"Why do you think the staff is important?"
"204987124-0-48980";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-48981";"Do you really think this could lead to all-out war with the Ashlanders?"
"204987124-0-48982";"Why do you think the people are going to panic?"
"204987124-0-48983";"You really expect that strong a reaction just because Vivec's ill?"
"204987124-0-48984";"What's causing Vivec's loss of divine energy?"
"204987124-0-48985";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-48987";"Yes, it's Nocturnal. Do you have any counsel to offer?"
"204987124-0-48990";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48991";"It was the Skeleton Key. Sotha Sil gave it to Divayth Fyr for safekeeping."
"204987124-0-48994";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-48997";"And the Clockwork City? Did he talk about that?"
"204987124-0-48998";"You mentioned a Psijic Ritemaster. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-49008";"Is this oil dangerous?"
"204987124-0-49009";"Where does this oil come from?"
"204987124-0-49010";"Is this oil dangerous?"
"204987124-0-49011";"How do you keep the stone from blowing up Slag Town?"
"204987124-0-49012";"Is cutting the pipes a good idea?"
"204987124-0-49013";"How do you keep the stone from blowing up Slag Town?"
"204987124-0-49014";"Are there other uses for the fibers?"
"204987124-0-49015";"What can you tell me about this lodestone?"
"204987124-0-49016";"Are there other uses for the fibers?"
"204987124-0-49017";"What do you do with the wood husks?"
"204987124-0-49018";"And what about the coals?"
"204987124-0-49019";"And what do you do with the wood husks?"
"204987124-0-49020";"What do you do with this runic residue?"
"204987124-0-49021";"Practical enchantments?"
"204987124-0-49022";"A portal?"
"204987124-0-49023";"What kind of illnesses do you have down here?"
"204987124-0-49024";"Razgurug mentioned syrup?"
"204987124-0-49025";"What kind of illnesses do you have down here?"
"204987124-0-49032";"Do you know what drives them to do this? What are they planning?"
"204987124-0-49033";"I was hoping you could tell me that."
"204987124-0-49034";"Where did you get the perception tabulator you gave to me?"
"204987124-0-49035";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-49036";"What else can you tell me about Divayth Fyr?"
"204987124-0-49037";"Yes. The Shadow is headed for Sotha Sil. I need to know how the cultists move around the city."
"204987124-0-49038";"Tell me about this contract."
"204987124-0-49040";"You should escape while you can."
"204987124-0-49041";"Why are you called the Tarnished?"
"204987124-0-49044";"We can use a gate to enter Evergloam, then find another gate inside that leads to the Cogitum."
"204987124-0-49046";"He mentioned one to the east, and one to the west—hidden in caves."
"204987124-0-49047";"How did you become the mayor?"
"204987124-0-49048";"Why are you lower?"
"204987124-0-49049";"Why are you called the Tarnished?"
"204987124-0-49050";"What do the Apostles do?"
"204987124-0-49054";"All right, I'll go talk to Luciana."
"204987124-0-49055";"Is this oil dangerous?"
"204987124-0-49056";"He's missing."
"204987124-0-49057";"Yes. She wants you to organize a city-wide search so we can bring him in for questioning."
"204987124-0-49058";"He might be consorting with Daedra. I found a Nocturnal Shrike in his office—and this odd note."
"204987124-0-49059";"Can you spare anything to help?"
"204987124-0-49060";"All right, I'll go talk to Dalomar."
"204987124-0-49062";"Dangerous work?"
"204987124-0-49063";"Are these requests worth the risk?"
"204987124-0-49064";"Can you tell me more about Slag Town?"
"204987124-0-49065";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-49072";"Good. Can I see it?"
"204987124-0-49074";"Why is the Wellspring different?"
"204987124-0-49075";"How do you get the plants to grow in metallic soil?"
"204987124-0-49076";"Why would the factotums do that?"
"204987124-0-49077";"Sherizar thinks there might be some sort of problem here at the oasis."
"204987124-0-49078";"But the Wellspring produced a bountiful harvest. Are you doing something different here?"
"204987124-0-49079";"Don't you receive new apprentices at this time every year?"
"204987124-0-49080";"I think I'll just use Snuffler."
"204987124-0-49083";"I'll put an end to Lector Naril."
"204987124-0-49084";"Clockwork City needs the Wellspring. Put out a call for willing volunteers."
"204987124-0-49085";"What's the Evergloam?"
"204987124-0-49086";"What's a shadow array?"
"204987124-0-49092";"And my reward?"
"204987124-0-49096";"I hope so. Someone has been killing his associates in the Order of the Eye."
"204987124-0-49098";"I'll find him."
"204987124-0-49100";"Well, what do you know?"
"204987124-0-49101";"You exile people for plagiarism?"
"204987124-0-49109";"If the oasis wasn't finished, where does the harvest come from?"
"204987124-0-49110";"You mentioned the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-49111";"All right. Let's see your oasis."
"204987124-0-49112";"You know how to reach the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49113";"Where can I find these Gloaming Gates?"
"204987124-0-49115";"Why ask me to help?"
"204987124-0-49116";"Why ask me to help?"
"204987124-0-49118";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49119";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49120";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49121";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49122";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49123";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49124";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49125";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49126";"All right, I'll work with you."
"204987124-0-49127";"Explain."
"204987124-0-49128";"I'll be off then."
"204987124-0-49129";"You think the Jarl's hall is still standing?"
"204987124-0-49130";"So this is an actual, physical document?"
"204987124-0-49132";"And?"
"204987124-0-49133";"How do you keep the stone from blowing up Slag Town?"
"204987124-0-49136";"Where can I find these Gloaming Gates?"
"204987124-0-49137";"Do you know him well?"
"204987124-0-49138";"Indoril Nerevar?"
"204987124-0-49139";"Almalexia?"
"204987124-0-49140";"Are you concerned about seeking an object that got other people killed?"
"204987124-0-49141";"I'll help you reach Chirrhari."
"204987124-0-49142";"Lector Naril sent me to find you. Maybe he can explain things."
"204987124-0-49144";"Who's Idrono?"
"204987124-0-49145";"What about the apprentice selected last year?"
"204987124-0-49148";"We'll gather some mushrooms and bring them to Idrono."
"204987124-0-49149";"How do you simulate sunlight?"
"204987124-0-49151";"How do you get the plants to grow in metallic soil?"
"204987124-0-49152";"We will see about that."
"204987124-0-49154";"Simulated sunlight?"
"204987124-0-49155";"I'll watch for the fabricants on the way to talk to Ohtowen."
"204987124-0-49158";"We'll take a look in Lector Naril's private workshop."
"204987124-0-49159";"Well, Lector Naril selected Sherizar. And Sherizar saw Marico get selected last season."
"204987124-0-49162";"Why did you mention Clavicus Vile earlier? Are his agents in the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49163";"Enough. Answer my question. Are Clavicus Vile's minions in the city?"
"204987124-0-49164";"My fabricant's lost the scent. Which way did he go?"
"204987124-0-49167";"What have you done? Did you make a deal with these shadow cultists?"
"204987124-0-49168";"Like … a revolution?"
"204987124-0-49169";"Let's change the subject. What do you do with this runic residue?"
"204987124-0-49171";"All right. What are runelights?"
"204987124-0-49172";"You seem like an accomplished mage. What are you doing in Slag Town?"
"204987124-0-49176";"How do I get a citizen to sponsor me?"
"204987124-0-49177";"Fair enough."
"204987124-0-49178";"Can't you sponsor me?"
"204987124-0-49182";"Who's Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-49187";"Gascone promised to deliver a key to Clavicus Vile, but crows stole it before he had the chance."
"204987124-0-49189";"Gascone promised to deliver a key to Clavicus Vile, but crows stole it before he had the chance."
"204987124-0-49191";"Who stole this key?"
"204987124-0-49193";"But these skaafin serve Clavicus Vile, don't they? If they knew you'd lost the key, why take you in?"
"204987124-0-49195";"What can you tell me about these coals?"
"204987124-0-49196";"Do you know how to recover your shadow?"
"204987124-0-49197";"Do you have any idea what sent us here?"
"204987124-0-49203";"The Skeleton Key."
"204987124-0-49204";"And what of the shadow imposter? Did you know Sotha Sil had been replaced?"
"204987124-0-49206";"Crows?"
"204987124-0-49207";"You endangered everyone in Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-49208";"Tell me about this key."
"204987124-0-49211";"How is it Sotha Sil's fault?"
"204987124-0-49215";"Why would he do that?"
"204987124-0-49216";"All right, you've convinced me. How do we return the stars?"
"204987124-0-49217";"How can I prove my mental fitness?"
"204987124-0-49218";"Depository Documatis. Got it. What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-49219";"What is the Mnemonic Planisphere?"
"204987124-0-49220";"What's your relationship with him?"
"204987124-0-49221";"You seem young for such an important role."
"204987124-0-49222";"Why does Sotha Sil need to give his memories form?"
"204987124-0-49224";"Why do the cultists want his memories?"
"204987124-0-49225";"You mentioned Sotha Sil. Who is he?"
"204987124-0-49227";"What do you hope to find in Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49229";"What is the Mnemonic Planisphere?"
"204987124-0-49230";"BAL-167 … Constable Baldan. I'll track down Kireth and see what she's found."
"204987124-0-49231";"What do you want me to do with this?"
"204987124-0-49232";"Not yet, but I'll find out. You tell Varuni and Neramo."
"204987124-0-49233";"Will this be enough?"
"204987124-0-49236";"My friend may die if you don't help me. You want that on your conscience?"
"204987124-0-49237";"Thank you. I won't mention we spoke."
"204987124-0-49239";"Would you still feel that way if I snapped both your legs?"
"204987124-0-49240";"We might surprise you."
"204987124-0-49242";"What kind of kindness?"
"204987124-0-49244";"All right, I'll find your animo core."
"204987124-0-49246";"Now I remember. I fought alongside him in the Halls of Fabrication."
"204987124-0-49249";"All right. We can look for him."
"204987124-0-49250";"Do you know where I can find more of the crows?"
"204987124-0-49251";"So someone sent out clockwork hounds?"
"204987124-0-49253";"All right. Thank you."
"204987124-0-49255";"What do the others think?"
"204987124-0-49256";"What do you think happened?"
"204987124-0-49257";"Why did Sotha Sil hide the Clockwork City here?"
"204987124-0-49261";"What are the Halls of Regulation?"
"204987124-0-49262";"And you said this one is a memory of the Astronomer?"
"204987124-0-49263";"Let's take a look."
"204987124-0-49265";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-49267";"Do you think he'll talk?"
"204987124-0-49268";"Will you sponsor Neramo, Raynor, and Kireth as well?"
"204987124-0-49270";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-49271";"What if I go get a tribute for the Court?"
"204987124-0-49272";"<<1>>. Provost Varuni Arvel."
"204987124-0-49273";"As a peace offering. He wants you to stop heckling him and bothering people in the Fortress."
"204987124-0-49274";"Did you just say something about torchbugs?"
"204987124-0-49275";"Why isn't the Astronomer helping?"
"204987124-0-49276";"Where can I find this treasure?"
"204987124-0-49277";"So the constellation reflects the memory."
"204987124-0-49278";"What about Raynor and Kireth?"
"204987124-0-49280";"Take care of yourself, Neramo."
"204987124-0-49281";"Do you think you could go through with it?"
"204987124-0-49283";"If I can talk to the crows' leader, I might be able to get them to leave for good."
"204987124-0-49285";"Does Sotha Sil forget the memories he stores?"
"204987124-0-49288";"Who is the Astronomer?"
"204987124-0-49289";"Did one of you steal a key from the Clockwork Basilica?"
"204987124-0-49292";"Do you have any idea what sent us here?"
"204987124-0-49293";"Can you tell me where it is?"
"204987124-0-49294";"Where is this Knight of Marrow?"
"204987124-0-49295";"Yes, I can definitely imagine."
"204987124-0-49296";"Who are Kireth and Raynor?"
"204987124-0-49297";"Vimy didn't join you for this trip?"
"204987124-0-49298";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-49299";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-49300";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-49302";"All right, I'll check on Raynor."
"204987124-0-49303";"Why does an Imperial serve a Dark Elf god?"
"204987124-0-49305";"She mentioned the Clockwork Apostles."
"204987124-0-49306";"Are they all like Luciana?"
"204987124-0-49308";"All right. Neramo and I will find the proof you need."
"204987124-0-49310";"All right. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-49311";"Who exactly is Luciana Pullo?"
"204987124-0-49315";"All right. I'll make my way to the loft and wait for your signal."
"204987124-0-49317";"All right. I'll find her, Raynor."
"204987124-0-49324";"If I help you win over your lady love, will you take me to the Duke?"
"204987124-0-49325";"You want me to help you write a love poem?"
"204987124-0-49326";"He becomes your enemy?"
"204987124-0-49327";"How do you know so much about Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-49328";"Of course."
"204987124-0-49329";"Of course."
"204987124-0-49331";"Trust yourself. It's a duty that only you can face."
"204987124-0-49333";"What kind of gifts do you offer? Can you give me power?"
"204987124-0-49334";"I could help you fight off these Exarchs."
"204987124-0-49335";"What other gifts do you offer? Can you give me power?"
"204987124-0-49336";"What about the Skeleton Key?"
"204987124-0-49337";"What other gifts do you offer? Can you give me power?"
"204987124-0-49340";"I want power."
"204987124-0-49343";"Why are you fighting the Exarchs?"
"204987124-0-49344";"How long have you been fighting?"
"204987124-0-49345";"Sotha Sil might have a problem with that."
"204987124-0-49346";"So it cleans the water?"
"204987124-0-49348";"All right, I'll deal with this Motionless Guardian."
"204987124-0-49349";"Fine, but this is it. What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-49351";"So you want me to operate the controls in secret?"
"204987124-0-49352";"All right. Do you know what any of these controls do?"
"204987124-0-49353";"Fine."
"204987124-0-49354";"How has he diverted?"
"204987124-0-49356";"Sotha Sil is difficult to work for?"
"204987124-0-49357";"Are you sure he hasn't always been this way? You said he was never around."
"204987124-0-49358";"What are you doing with the old lamps?"
"204987124-0-49359";"He makes the servants darken rooms before he enters, and demanded that some lamps be replaced."
"204987124-0-49360";"Expose him to the light?"
"204987124-0-49363";"He wants us to build a lamp—one that's identical to the lamps removed from the loqutorium."
"204987124-0-49366";"Where were you? Luciana and I nearly died fighting the Shadow."
"204987124-0-49367";"So she trapped you?"
"204987124-0-49368";"Fine. So, what are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-49370";"Why is the water cycle breaking down?"
"204987124-0-49371";"And they only sent you to fix this problem?"
"204987124-0-49372";"What are the Halls of Regulation?"
"204987124-0-49373";"And if we don't fix the malfunction?"
"204987124-0-49374";"What are the Halls of Regulation?"
"204987124-0-49375";"So, can you recreate one of these lights?"
"204987124-0-49376";"Is this enough?"
"204987124-0-49377";"Which way?"
"204987124-0-49379";"I'll be sure to let her know."
"204987124-0-49380";"I'll think about it."
"204987124-0-49381";"Lord Seht meaning Sotha Sil, right? You've never met him?"
"204987124-0-49382";"Yes, I'll let Divayth know we'll be ready soon."
"204987124-0-49383";"Neramo believes they emit some kind of invisible light."
"204987124-0-49384";"Thanks for the warning, Kireth."
"204987124-0-49386";"Can you tell me more about Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-49387";"You record what happens in the streets?"
"204987124-0-49388";"Embellished in what way?"
"204987124-0-49389";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-49390";"Wait, exo-what?"
"204987124-0-49391";"You seem to know a lot about him."
"204987124-0-49392";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-49394";"But they didn't let you join?"
"204987124-0-49395";"So you came here to the Halls of Regulation to prove yourself."
"204987124-0-49397";"Why didn't you just tell me that? Why lie?"
"204987124-0-49398";"Are you sure you can maintain this place?"
"204987124-0-49400";"So, you're going to guide a clockwork automaton into the building?"
"204987124-0-49401";"Could you make more?"
"204987124-0-49402";"So this gear will be ruined eventually?"
"204987124-0-49403";"Does that mean the water isn't being properly filtered now?"
"204987124-0-49404";"But what if I have to destroy it?"
"204987124-0-49405";"What is then?"
"204987124-0-49406";"And what about the cleansing crystal?"
"204987124-0-49408";"So you want me to talk to the other aides?"
"204987124-0-49410";"All right, I'll talk to the other aides."
"204987124-0-49411";"Is Proctor Luciana still insisting you leave the city?"
"204987124-0-49412";"Has he made any other changes?"
"204987124-0-49413";"How can you be sure something is wrong with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-49414";"Who is Gascone?"
"204987124-0-49415";"How can you be sure something is wrong with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-49416";"Interesting. And what do the ventilation gears do?"
"204987124-0-49417";"Is flipping switches that difficult?"
"204987124-0-49418";"That sounds frustrating."
"204987124-0-49420";"Thanks for letting me know all that. I should get going."
"204987124-0-49421";"Blasphemy?"
"204987124-0-49423";"Sorry to hear that. I should get going."
"204987124-0-49426";"If you're certain …."
"204987124-0-49427";"What's the worst part?"
"204987124-0-49429";"That does sound frustrating, but …."
"204987124-0-49431";"I don't. But I really have to go. Good luck."
"204987124-0-49435";"An aide told me they tossed the old lamps into the Fundament. We should start there."
"204987124-0-49437";"We plan to use it on Sotha Sil. I'm not exactly sure what will happen."
"204987124-0-49439";"You too."
"204987124-0-49441";"Farewell, Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-49445";"You want my help to find that out?"
"204987124-0-49447";"I'll help you deal with these necromancers."
"204987124-0-49448";"Where are your companions now?"
"204987124-0-49450";"We'll help you rescue your companions."
"204987124-0-49455";"<<1>> told me you cheated her during your last trade."
"204987124-0-49456";"You'd better. Or I'll find out."
"204987124-0-49457";"<<1>> told me you cheated her during your last trade."
"204987124-0-49459";"Should I bring Divayth Fyr here to settle this? Or perhaps Proctor Luciana?"
"204987124-0-49461";"See you soon."
"204987124-0-49464";"All right. I'll get the lamp into position on the balcony."
"204987124-0-49466";"Bolin seemed grateful for what you did."
"204987124-0-49469";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-49472";"Take care of yourself, Divayth."
"204987124-0-49473";"Seems like Chancellor Gascone has worries of his own."
"204987124-0-49475";"What do you suggest we do?"
"204987124-0-49478";"All right, I'll go find Neramo and Raynor."
"204987124-0-49480";"Your master is in danger. Let us through so we can help him."
"204987124-0-49481";"I'll be sure to do that."
"204987124-0-49483";"Now can you help us?"
"204987124-0-49484";"There is a threat! The Daedric Prince, Nocturnal."
"204987124-0-49486";"All the more reason to follow the crow."
"204987124-0-49490";"Are you sure there's nothing you can do?"
"204987124-0-49491";"Ode to a Brass Lily seems lovely. <Show the Knight your transcription.>"
"204987124-0-49492";"I'll meet you at the Machine District."
"204987124-0-49493";"I'll meet you at the Machine District."
"204987124-0-49494";"I'll meet you at the Machine District."
"204987124-0-49496";"Did one of you steal a key from the Clockwork Basilica?"
"204987124-0-49497";"Who are these Exarchs again?"
"204987124-0-49498";"How did you learn how to talk?"
"204987124-0-49499";"All right. I'll help you write this poem."
"204987124-0-49500";"Don't worry. We're in this together."
"204987124-0-49502";"All right. I'll be back soon."
"204987124-0-49503";"Sherizar and I would like to see them, if that's all right."
"204987124-0-49505";"What is the Mnemonic Planisphere?"
"204987124-0-49506";"Are we prohibited from talking to the other apprentices?"
"204987124-0-49508";"No restrictions? Apprentice Idrono said no one is allowed in your private workshop."
"204987124-0-49513";"Is it worth the price?"
"204987124-0-49514";"What can you tell me about your order?"
"204987124-0-49515";"What is it that's ailing you?"
"204987124-0-49516";"So, you need me to get a tok-plug. Where can I find one of those?"
"204987124-0-49519";"Evergloam?"
"204987124-0-49521";"Where can I find one of these Gloaming Gates?"
"204987124-0-49522";"What did it tell you?"
"204987124-0-49524";"Yes."
"204987124-0-49525";"Why doesn't Sotha Sil let you enter the factories?"
"204987124-0-49526";"Why doesn't Sotha Sil let you enter the factories?"
"204987124-0-49527";"And secondly?"
"204987124-0-49529";"Leave it to me."
"204987124-0-49532";"You're really one of the Clockwork Apostles?"
"204987124-0-49533";"Where did you get the perception tabulator you provided me with?"
"204987124-0-49534";"Isn't Sotha Sil something like a god?"
"204987124-0-49535";"Could I meet him?"
"204987124-0-49536";"You sounded tired earlier. Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-49537";"So, Precursor, do you know where the rest of your body is?"
"204987124-0-49539";"What does it say?"
"204987124-0-49540";"I'm <<1>>, and I'm not an apostle."
"204987124-0-49541";"But we don't have any other parts."
"204987124-0-49542";"Loquacious?"
"204987124-0-49544";"Why is this place such a threat to you?"
"204987124-0-49547";"All right. How might I accomplish that?"
"204987124-0-49549";"The end result wasn't as you'd hoped."
"204987124-0-49550";"Just who is Bolin?"
"204987124-0-49551";"Just who is Bolin?"
"204987124-0-49552";"Where did you get the perception tabulator you gave to me?"
"204987124-0-49553";"He's reconstructed an ancient factotum."
"204987124-0-49555";"Come see for yourself."
"204987124-0-49556";"We won't know until we find him."
"204987124-0-49558";"You don't remember anything else?"
"204987124-0-49560";"Is there anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-49562";"What fortune did you receive?"
"204987124-0-49572";"What will you do with your new life?"
"204987124-0-49573";"So what do you plan to do about it?"
"204987124-0-49575";"The Vale of Tiers is dangerous. Let me help you."
"204987124-0-49577";"You seem to be coping well."
"204987124-0-49578";"You seem to be coping well."
"204987124-0-49579";"You should visit the Asylum Sanctorium, just to be sure."
"204987124-0-49580";"So why do your people keep going back to the Prognosticator?"
"204987124-0-49582";"You don't believe people can change their destiny?"
"204987124-0-49584";"How do we activate the Grand Prognosticator?"
"204987124-0-49585";"And what are you going to be doing while I take that kind of risk?"
"204987124-0-49586";"Can't a person just want to help an old friend? Besides, who wouldn't want to explore this place?"
"204987124-0-49588";"Let's go explore the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-49592";"All right, I'll find a working animo core."
"204987124-0-49593";"All right, I'll find a working animo core."
"204987124-0-49596";"What's so important about her tabulator?"
"204987124-0-49597";"Why did you send a lowly initiate into the Shadow Cleft?"
"204987124-0-49598";"What were your impressions of Proctor Luciana?"
"204987124-0-49599";"After you finish your explorations, how do you plan to get back to Morrowind?"
"204987124-0-49601";"What were your impressions of Proctor Luciana?"
"204987124-0-49602";"Is that how she got here?"
"204987124-0-49603";"You know, Kireth thinks you let Neramo walk all over you."
"204987124-0-49604";"You're a Dark Elf. Should you even be asking such questions about one of your gods?"
"204987124-0-49606";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-49607";"Organic matter? Even the trees are made of metal here."
"204987124-0-49609";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-49610";"What did Kireth suggest?"
"204987124-0-49611";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-49612";"It sounds like you're having some regrets."
"204987124-0-49615";"Maybe you could talk to her and let Kireth know how you feel. You're siblings, after all."
"204987124-0-49616";"What's wrong with the ventilation fan?"
"204987124-0-49618";"And you're the one to give it to them?"
"204987124-0-49619";"I believe you.  We need your knowledge to stop the Shadow of Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-49620";"Thirdly …?"
"204987124-0-49623";"Can you tell me more about the filtration system?"
"204987124-0-49624";"Wake up and talk to me."
"204987124-0-49625";"Hello?"
"204987124-0-49626";"What are you?"
"204987124-0-49627";"What data do you gather?"
"204987124-0-49628";"So, you use the data to tell fortunes?"
"204987124-0-49629";"What are you?"
"204987124-0-49630";"What are commutators?"
"204987124-0-49631";"And when was the last time Sotha Sil made such improvements?"
"204987124-0-49632";"Can you tell me my fortune?"
"204987124-0-49633";"It is. I'll take some off your hands."
"204987124-0-49636";"Why am I looking for notes? Doesn't Oscard use a tabulator?"
"204987124-0-49640";"What's wrong with the ventilation fan?"
"204987124-0-49641";"Why can't the Apostles supply me with oil?"
"204987124-0-49646";"You weren't able to finish repairs on your own?"
"204987124-0-49647";"And they put you in charge of repairs?"
"204987124-0-49648";"So they gave the task to you."
"204987124-0-49650";"Why can't the Apostles supply me with oil?"
"204987124-0-49651";"Shadow women?"
"204987124-0-49652";"Why do you care about this key so much?"
"204987124-0-49653";"Who are these Exarchs again?"
"204987124-0-49654";"Why can't the Apostles supply me with the filters?"
"204987124-0-49655";"Can you tell me more about the filtration system?"
"204987124-0-49656";"Why can't the Apostles supply me with the filters?"
"204987124-0-49657";"How do I replace the commutators?"
"204987124-0-49658";"What are commutators?"
"204987124-0-49659";"How do I replace the commutators?"
"204987124-0-49660";"Wrath? Seriously?"
"204987124-0-49661";"What are you trying to do?"
"204987124-0-49663";"And? What do you get the person who has everything?"
"204987124-0-49667";"Wait, you just wrote a poem?"
"204987124-0-49668";"What if I'm caught?"
"204987124-0-49669";"You seem to know what you're doing. Why do you need Salas's secret to prepare them?"
"204987124-0-49670";"You were born in Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49671";"Your mother's name was Maliah?"
"204987124-0-49672";"I'll place the animo core in the machine."
"204987124-0-49673";"I'll place the animo core in the machine."
"204987124-0-49674";"I found her journal. You should have it."
"204987124-0-49675";"All right. Stay close."
"204987124-0-49677";"Permission granted."
"204987124-0-49678";"Permission granted."
"204987124-0-49679";"Permission granted."
"204987124-0-49680";"Permission granted."
"204987124-0-49681";"Prophecy? About me?"
"204987124-0-49682";"Prophecy? About me?"
"204987124-0-49683";"Prophecy? About me?"
"204987124-0-49684";"The mushrooms you want. What's so special about them?"
"204987124-0-49685";"What kinds of tributes do you demand?"
"204987124-0-49686";"What do you mean, a tribute of flesh?"
"204987124-0-49687";"Wrath, seriously?"
"204987124-0-49688";"Any idea how I might learn Salas's secret?"
"204987124-0-49689";"Tell me about the Wraith-of-Crows."
"204987124-0-49690";"How are you going to find something that has eluded your people for generations?"
"204987124-0-49693";"What is the Imperfect?"
"204987124-0-49694";"Tell me about the tribute of silver."
"204987124-0-49695";"Tell me about the tribute of flesh."
"204987124-0-49696";"Wrath, seriously?"
"204987124-0-49697";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-49700";"How did you and the Exarchs get here?"
"204987124-0-49701";"You have your work cut out for you."
"204987124-0-49702";"Wait, you've heard about Sotha Sil? What else do you know?"
"204987124-0-49703";"Why are you fighting these Exarchs, anyway?"
"204987124-0-49704";"The mushrooms you want. What's so special about them?"
"204987124-0-49705";"Why are these threats occurring?"
"204987124-0-49706";"Why do you say it's impossible to reach the treasure?"
"204987124-0-49707";"Where can we find the wreckage of the merchant caravan?"
"204987124-0-49709";"Thank you. I won't let anything happen to Kamid."
"204987124-0-49710";"Tell me about the Wraith-of-Crows."
"204987124-0-49711";"Why are these threats occurring?"
"204987124-0-49712";"How did some old passphrases lead you to the treasure?"
"204987124-0-49714";"Oh no, you're not sitting this one out! You're going to help me with this or …."
"204987124-0-49719";"You make it sound like those spices are worth their weight in gold."
"204987124-0-49721";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-49722";"You can do it. Just tell them the truth about the Prognosticator and speak from the heart."
"204987124-0-49724";"What do you plan to do with it?"
"204987124-0-49725";"You mentioned Maurice got the Root Liqueur before. Who is he?"
"204987124-0-49726";"Have you asked him about finding more Root Liqueur?"
"204987124-0-49727";"This Root Liqueur is a Valenwood delicacy?"
"204987124-0-49728";"So, this Root Liqueur is a Valenwood delicacy?"
"204987124-0-49729";"Why do I need to collect sequence plaques?"
"204987124-0-49730";"What is the Imperfect's ultimate goal?"
"204987124-0-49731";"What is the Imperfect?"
"204987124-0-49732";"What is the Imperfect?"
"204987124-0-49733";"Tubabi must be special to you."
"204987124-0-49734";"Can't I just buy nix hound meat from Bratheru?"
"204987124-0-49735";"Can't I just buy nix hound meat from Bratheru?"
"204987124-0-49737";"The factotum said it collects and analyzes data about the people of the Brass Fortress."
"204987124-0-49738";"I'll place the animo core in the machine so you can ask the Prognosticator."
"204987124-0-49740";"I suppose we'll both be cooking then."
"204987124-0-49741";"Do you have everything you need now?"
"204987124-0-49742";"Do you have everything you need now?"
"204987124-0-49751";"Why did you give the passphrase to Kamid's mother if you feel that way?"
"204987124-0-49754";"So she found Palbatan's hiding place?"
"204987124-0-49756";"You can do it. Just tell them the truth about the Prognosticator and speak from the heart."
"204987124-0-49757";"Didn't we just work really hard to convince Slag Town that it can't do that?"
"204987124-0-49758";"Then why did the Prognosticator keep giving everyone the same dire fortune?"
"204987124-0-49760";"I think the Prognosticator mentioned a passphrase when I tried to talk to it."
"204987124-0-49762";"Do you and your brother argue very often?"
"204987124-0-49763";"You're sure you don't want to go after your brother?"
"204987124-0-49764";"Do you and Raynor argue very often?"
"204987124-0-49766";"So you activated it for me?"
"204987124-0-49768";"What about Luciana?"
"204987124-0-49771";"All right, let's explore the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-49772";"So, will you let me help you?"
"204987124-0-49773";"Sorry, there's no time. I did you a favor when I spared your life. Tell me what you know."
"204987124-0-49776";"So there is a way to change the future."
"204987124-0-49780";"What can you tell me about this lodestone?"
"204987124-0-49781";"Why don't you gather them from clothing you already have?"
"204987124-0-49782";"Right, what is this syrup?"
"204987124-0-49784";"Why will this factotum help with that research?"
"204987124-0-49787";"Won't it anger the Temple if I harm these Saints?"
"204987124-0-49788";"What went wrong?"
"204987124-0-49789";"What will happen to the Saints when their soul gems are removed?"
"204987124-0-49790";"That happens often?"
"204987124-0-49791";"You had other patients in the past?"
"204987124-0-49792";"And after they proved unstable?"
"204987124-0-49793";"How did the Saints come to inhabit machines?"
"204987124-0-49794";"Who are these Saints you watch over?"
"204987124-0-49795";"What's to keep you from coming back?"
"204987124-0-49796";"Who are these Saints you watch over?"
"204987124-0-49797";"Where were you? Luciana and I nearly died fighting the Shadow."
"204987124-0-49798";"Who are you really?"
"204987124-0-49799";"If you believe that, why even call yourself a god?"
"204987124-0-49800";"But you're supposed to be a god, right?"
"204987124-0-49801";"What are your feelings on Almalexia?"
"204987124-0-49802";"You had other patients in the past?"
"204987124-0-49803";"Why were the Saints created to be so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-49804";"Of course."
"204987124-0-49805";"Didn't you just say that you question whether the City is worth the effort?"
"204987124-0-49806";"So … you were forced to build the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49807";"Who are you really?"
"204987124-0-49808";"If that's true, how did Nocturnal attack us in the Cogitum?"
"204987124-0-49809";"Who are you really?"
"204987124-0-49810";"Who are you really?"
"204987124-0-49811";"Maybe?"
"204987124-0-49812";"How so?"
"204987124-0-49813";"What are his struggles?"
"204987124-0-49814";"How is Almalexia different?"
"204987124-0-49815";"And what about Vivec?"
"204987124-0-49816";"Does that bother you?"
"204987124-0-49817";"And that's not enough? To be a god hero?"
"204987124-0-49818";"Despair?"
"204987124-0-49819";"What about Almalexia?"
"204987124-0-49820";"I already defeated Clavicus Vile in Vvardenfell."
"204987124-0-49821";"So what should we do?"
"204987124-0-49822";"So what should we do?"
"204987124-0-49823";"Why do you keep calling me the Prisoner?"
"204987124-0-49824";"So wouldn't that make you the prisoner?"
"204987124-0-49825";"You don't see the door?"
"204987124-0-49826";"You haven't done that?"
"204987124-0-49827";"I'm sorry to bring bad news, but Orinol is dead."
"204987124-0-49828";"You should read his journal. I've brought it with me."
"204987124-0-49830";"Will you take care of Jona?"
"204987124-0-49831";"How do these seals work?"
"204987124-0-49833";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-49834";"And they haven't worked?"
"204987124-0-49835";"He's actually correct. The Shadow took the Skeleton Key right out from under me."
"204987124-0-49837";"You might need to rethink some of these notions, Varuni."
"204987124-0-49838";"Data?"
"204987124-0-49842";"Well, here's your brassilisk."
"204987124-0-49843";"We'll stop the Shadow."
"204987124-0-49844";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-49846";"What is an acceptable level of Daedric corruption?"
"204987124-0-49847";"I found a journal next to her corpse. I'm sorry to say she died."
"204987124-0-49848";"I found your clan's sword as well."
"204987124-0-49850";"Dulza wanted it to be returned to your clan."
"204987124-0-49851";"What information do these plaques contain?"
"204987124-0-49854";"I'm always cautious."
"204987124-0-49856";"All right. You disable the explosions, I disable the spiders, then we give the oil to Varuni."
"204987124-0-49857";"Can you siphon the oil if I disable them?"
"204987124-0-49859";"All right. Is there at least a reward for returning them?"
"204987124-0-49862";"So she's your teacher?"
"204987124-0-49864";"What's wrong with studying factotums?"
"204987124-0-49865";"Can you tell me anything else about what I'm looking for?"
"204987124-0-49866";"Are you one of the first factotums?"
"204987124-0-49867";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-49869";"You mentioned an episode? What did you mean?"
"204987124-0-49870";"You're certain you want me to destroy Bolin's body?"
"204987124-0-49871";"What happened to the stars?"
"204987124-0-49881";"What does all of that mean?"
"204987124-0-49882";"I'll go and check on Oracle Marieve."
"204987124-0-49883";"Why did the Oracle's message make you uneasy?"
"204987124-0-49884";"What would happen if they succeeded in taking over?"
"204987124-0-49885";"So when Amili takes over, you'll die?"
"204987124-0-49886";"She does seem strangely cheerful for an apostle."
"204987124-0-49888";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-0-49889";"Why did the cultists corrupt the stars?"
"204987124-0-49891";"Why did the cultists corrupt the stars?"
"204987124-0-49892";"Do you think she'll make a good Astronomer?"
"204987124-0-49893";"What kind of warnings?"
"204987124-0-49894";"So what do those things mean?"
"204987124-0-49895";"Tell me more about Oracle Marieve."
"204987124-0-49896";"Why did the Oracle's message make you uneasy?"
"204987124-0-49897";"If every single record goes through the Depository, how are we going to find what we're looking for?"
"204987124-0-49898";"How did you learn to control a skeevaton?"
"204987124-0-49899";"How can we control a skeevaton without touching it?"
"204987124-0-49900";"Why start looking in the Depository Documatis?"
"204987124-0-49901";"So … you weren't actually dreaming?"
"204987124-0-49902";"What are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-49903";"She contacted Vanus. Mentioned my name, specifically."
"204987124-0-49904";"You're certain you want me to destroy Bolin's body?"
"204987124-0-49905";"I'll go to the Mines of Khuras and try to find the Oracle."
"204987124-0-49906";"Do you think the Clockwork Apostles will accept you like this?"
"204987124-0-49907";"Do you think the Clockwork Apostles will accept you like this?"
"204987124-0-49908";"Gustatory sensors … Lord Vivec …?"
"204987124-0-49912";"Secret message?"
"204987124-0-49913";"How many factotums exist in the City?"
"204987124-0-49914";"I'll find the ritual items."
"204987124-0-49915";"What was that about torchbugs?"
"204987124-0-49916";"Seventh generation?"
"204987124-0-49917";"He was dying, and thought the experiment might save him. It seems like it was successful, so far."
"204987124-0-49918";"It'd be best if you could keep an eye on him."
"204987124-0-49919";"Are mental conditions common in Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-49920";"What makes no sense?"
"204987124-0-49921";"What is our next step?"
"204987124-0-49922";"You don't think it's possible that Sotha Sil could be compromised?"
"204987124-0-49924";"It might not be that simple."
"204987124-0-49925";"What is our next step?"
"204987124-0-49929";"I'm not a constable. You can tell me."
"204987124-0-49930";"If your brew's so great, why hide it down here?"
"204987124-0-49931";"What do you mean, go screwy?"
"204987124-0-49933";"That sounds pretty serious."
"204987124-0-49934";"Tell me about this covenant Gascone made with Clavicus Vile and your mistress."
"204987124-0-49936";"Yes, hundreds of breeds exist in Tamriel."
"204987124-0-49937";"Do you have any idea why the Daedra want this key?"
"204987124-0-49938";"If we defeat the Shadow, maybe you can visit Tamriel yourself."
"204987124-0-49939";"Is there anything here in the Clockwork City they might want to unlock?"
"204987124-0-49940";"What about Sotha Sil? Does he have something locked away?"
"204987124-0-49941";"You really have never seen a crow before?"
"204987124-0-49942";"Are you sure about that?"
"204987124-0-49943";"Any new ideas about what disrupted our travel?"
"204987124-0-49944";"You'll see Sotha Sil soon. I asked him to save you."
"204987124-0-49946";"Farewell, Luciana."
"204987124-0-49948";"He promised me you will survive this."
"204987124-0-49949";"How do I collect stars?"
"204987124-0-49950";"Why did the cultists corrupt the stars?"
"204987124-0-49951";"What must I do?"
"204987124-0-49952";"And the cultists?"
"204987124-0-49954";"Summerset? Artaeum? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-49955";"Who are these others?"
"204987124-0-49956";"I'll find you at Bewan."
"204987124-0-49957";"I don't understand. What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-49958";"I don't understand. What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-49959";"Tell me more about the wyrd."
"204987124-0-49960";"Tell me more about the wyrd."
"204987124-0-49962";"And the cultists?"
"204987124-0-49965";"How goes the search for a new apprentice?"
"204987124-0-49966";"What do you mean by a right fit?"
"204987124-0-49968";"The Oracle mentioned Summerset and Artaeum. Can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-49969";"What do you mean Artaeum doesn't currently reside on Nirn?"
"204987124-0-49970";"What do you think they want with the Oracle?"
"204987124-0-49971";"The Oracle mentioned Summerset and Artaeum. Can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-49972";"I think I can handle that."
"204987124-0-49973";"How do I break the bindings?"
"204987124-0-49975";"Did they succeed?"
"204987124-0-49976";"Is there anyone else we can ask about the other apprentices?"
"204987124-0-49977";"How did he come to lead the efforts here at the Wellspring?"
"204987124-0-49978";"Farewell, Marieve."
"204987124-0-49979";"And what about the rest of your vision?"
"204987124-0-49980";"Farewell, Marieve."
"204987124-0-49981";"How did the vent get busted?"
"204987124-0-49983";"Thanks for the information. Here's something to tide you over."
"204987124-0-49984";"So you don't like the machines?"
"204987124-0-49989";"Will you be all right without your plaque of safe passage?"
"204987124-0-49991";"I saw black feathers all over his office."
"204987124-0-49992";"Yes. Is that unusual?"
"204987124-0-49993";"Do you have any idea where Gascone might have gone?"
"204987124-0-49994";"Some. Anyway, it looks like the end of that streak."
"204987124-0-49995";"Do you know what kind of things he tends to study?"
"204987124-0-49996";"How so?"
"204987124-0-49997";"All right. Does Gascone own birds?"
"204987124-0-49998";"The Shrike. You think he might be studying a Daedric portal?"
"204987124-0-50004";"And what exactly is the Blackfeather Court?"
"204987124-0-50006";"Why do you hate them so much?"
"204987124-0-50007";"So, you're from Oblivion? Like Daedra?"
"204987124-0-50008";"And these Exarchs you mentioned? Are they birds like you?"
"204987124-0-50010";"The mistress? Who is that?"
"204987124-0-50012";"So now you use it to mine information out of dead people?"
"204987124-0-50013";"What can you tell me about the Skeleton Key?"
"204987124-0-50014";"That sounds pretty extreme."
"204987124-0-50015";"Mind-lock?"
"204987124-0-50016";"What can you tell me about the Skeleton Key?"
"204987124-0-50017";"Did you say something about mining Gascone's brain?"
"204987124-0-50018";"So the Shadow of Sotha Sil seeks to unlock the center of the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-50019";"Have you ever seen it?"
"204987124-0-50020";"Understood. So, you have a prison in the basilica?"
"204987124-0-50021";"Are you sure he's even there?"
"204987124-0-50022";"You want me to go and accuse the Kinlady of conspiring with a Daedric cult?"
"204987124-0-50023";"I also met a mage from the Psijic Order in the monastery."
"204987124-0-50025";"Tsoxolza was dead by the time I reached him. I found this letter in his pack."
"204987124-0-50026";"Well, thanks for the help."
"204987124-0-50027";"Anyone in specific you want me to talk to regarding the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-50034";"All right, I'll help you investigate the monastery."
"204987124-0-50036";"I overheard that the Kinlady was going to meet the Aldarch in the Coral Forest."
"204987124-0-50037";"I just wanted to meet you."
"204987124-0-50040";"You're just as majestic as I imagined."
"204987124-0-50041";"And the Aldarch agrees with your efforts to protect the island and the newcomers?"
"204987124-0-50042";"It sounds like you should see for yourself what's happening at the monastery."
"204987124-0-50044";"Let me find out what Valsirenn has to say."
"204987124-0-50045";"I don't have any more questions."
"204987124-0-50046";"The Ballad of Brisbor Battle-Axe"
"204987124-0-50052";"What would you have said to him?"
"204987124-0-50053";"And now?"
"204987124-0-50054";"Do you think he'd have answers for you?"
"204987124-0-50056";"You're welcome?"
"204987124-0-50057";"What's the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-50058";"What's the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-50060";"How do you feel about the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-50062";"What does that word mean, nebarra?"
"204987124-0-50063";"Do you know what the Kinlady plans to do about the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-50064";"Is that why you're sequestering newcomers and other non-High Elves beneath the monastery?"
"204987124-0-50069";"Do you know what the Kinlady plans to do about the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-50071";"Tell me about Lector Naril."
"204987124-0-50077";"Who is Luciana Pullo?"
"204987124-0-50079";"You still have doubts about this outcome?"
"204987124-0-50080";"Why do you think his transition was so much easier than Bolin?"
"204987124-0-50081";"Take the good with the bad. Dwelling on things is only going to make you miserable."
"204987124-0-50082";"Bolin seemed grateful for what you did."
"204987124-0-50083";"Bolin seemed grateful for what you did."
"204987124-0-50084";"I saw a pearl like that. There were strange creatures nearby."
"204987124-0-50085";"I'll meet you in the undercroft."
"204987124-0-50088";"How do we plan to get out of here?"
"204987124-0-50089";"Was that really your shadow?"
"204987124-0-50092";"What was that about your prize?"
"204987124-0-50093";"Well, exodromals might take issue with being watched all the time."
"204987124-0-50100";"And?"
"204987124-0-50102";"So you opened a portal to an Oblivion realm?"
"204987124-0-50103";"How do we get in contact with a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-50104";"Why can't we use the Dreaming Cave to contact Meridia?"
"204987124-0-50106";"So you knew he planned to kill the newcomers?"
"204987124-0-50110";"That would probably be for the best."
"204987124-0-50111";"A new apprentice every year? Why do you need so many apprentices?"
"204987124-0-50112";"Valsirenn returned to Artaeum. She invited me to come and speak to their Ritemaster."
"204987124-0-50115";"Valsirenn said the Order would try to find out more about the Aldarch and the abyssal pearls."
"204987124-0-50116";"Sotha Sil? What threat? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-50122";"I understand how you feel. That Khajiit doesn't know his place."
"204987124-0-50129";"All right, I'll start by speaking to Emile."
"204987124-0-50132";"If you can't convince him to retract his confession, why do you think I can?"
"204987124-0-50133";"Are you? Reckless I mean?"
"204987124-0-50134";"What's your relationship with Emile?"
"204987124-0-50135";"What were their common interests?"
"204987124-0-50136";"What's your relationship with Emile?"
"204987124-0-50149";"How is Emile more talented?"
"204987124-0-50150";"Why haven't you looked into this matter yourself?"
"204987124-0-50151";"So Haladan's murder has caused tension between the Mages Guild and Sapiarchs?"
"204987124-0-50152";"What can you tell me about Vivienne?"
"204987124-0-50154";"I need to talk to a priest of Meridia."
"204987124-0-50157";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-50160";"Will she be all right?"
"204987124-0-50164";"The Court of Bedlam might have wiped out Meridia's cult with its attack."
"204987124-0-50165";"Before I go, have you learned anything else about the Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-0-50174";"Can they be freed?"
"204987124-0-50175";"Meridia aided me in the past. She'll remember me."
"204987124-0-50176";"Tell me how to reach the shrine."
"204987124-0-50177";"I'll meet you at Meridia's shrine."
"204987124-0-50178";"Tell me how to reach the shrine."
"204987124-0-50180";"Her condition seems pretty grave. I'm not sure if she'll survive."
"204987124-0-50182";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-50183";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-50184";"Vampirism? Did you kill Haladan?"
"204987124-0-50185";"If your companion murdered Haladan, why is Emile taking the blame?"
"204987124-0-50187";"So Emile would sacrifice himself to protect Haladan's memory?"
"204987124-0-50188";"The hunger?"
"204987124-0-50189";"How do you plan on getting out of here if you can't see?"
"204987124-0-50191";"How did both you and Gerwerdel contract it?"
"204987124-0-50192";"Why would Haladan risk all this?"
"204987124-0-50193";"Is Haladan's reputation really that important?"
"204987124-0-50194";"Would telling the truth put you at risk?"
"204987124-0-50195";"You think you can learn something from the pearl?"
"204987124-0-50198";"Do you even know what we're looking for?"
"204987124-0-50199";"What will you do to Constable Baldan?"
"204987124-0-50201";"Do you think there's more to these disappearances?"
"204987124-0-50202";"Darien? That's the Golden Knight's name?"
"204987124-0-50204";"She told me what happened. Her infected companion killed Haladan."
"204987124-0-50205";"The triad's attacking your realm?"
"204987124-0-50206";"What about the Dawnbreaker? Can it be repaired?"
"204987124-0-50207";"I know you infected Norasea with vampirism. I have Haladan's notes."
"204987124-0-50209";"I need to think about this."
"204987124-0-50211";"The Ritemaster will think of something. We just have to find Darien and repair the sword."
"204987124-0-50212";"Why do we need to collect a ventilation gear?"
"204987124-0-50213";"What will happen to Emile if I suppress this evidence?"
"204987124-0-50215";"What about the damage to Haladan's reputation, and the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-50219";"This is for the best."
"204987124-0-50221";"I hope you find peace."
"204987124-0-50223";"We can use the Dawnstar gem to find the Golden Knight. He can restore the Dawnbreaker."
"204987124-0-50224";"Meridia said her realm was being invaded. I think the triad of Princes attacked Meridia."
"204987124-0-50226";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-50227";"You endangered everyone in Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-50228";"It was the only way he knew to save his friend."
"204987124-0-50230";"So Emile is free to resume his studies?"
"204987124-0-50232";"What will happen to Emile now?"
"204987124-0-50234";"So that's it then?"
"204987124-0-50235";"And Norasea?"
"204987124-0-50246";"Sotha Sil's a member of the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-50247";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-50248";"So why aren't you helping with the ritual?"
"204987124-0-50249";"I'm not sure I understand where we are. How did the Psijics hide Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-50250";"I'm not sure I understand where we are. How did the Psijics hide Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-50251";"How did an Imperial end up in the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-50252";"Where is this place, exactly?"
"204987124-0-50253";"Or what?"
"204987124-0-50254";"So we're not in Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-50255";"Can't you use magic to summon the component you need?"
"204987124-0-50256";"Aren't the members of the Psijic Order all High Elves?"
"204987124-0-50257";"Where is this place, exactly?"
"204987124-0-50258";"I don't think the Clockwork Apostles will like that."
"204987124-0-50260";"Who's Ritemaster Iachesis?"
"204987124-0-50276";"What happened to her? How did she wind up here?"
"204987124-0-50277";"So now she serves him?"
"204987124-0-50278";"She didn't seem happy to see you."
"204987124-0-50280";"The Shadow took some of Sotha Sil's power. If we destroy it, Sotha Sil may be diminished."
"204987124-0-50281";"Can I ask you about your … enhancements?"
"204987124-0-50282";"You're all right with your god losing his power?"
"204987124-0-50283";"How do they work?"
"204987124-0-50284";"Do you even know how they work?"
"204987124-0-50285";"What are your thoughts on the shadowy imposter?"
"204987124-0-50288";"So it happened during a battle?"
"204987124-0-50289";"And that sent you here?"
"204987124-0-50290";"And Sotha Sil found you?"
"204987124-0-50291";"Is he always that vague?"
"204987124-0-50292";"Like Gascone?"
"204987124-0-50293";"What are your thoughts on this shadowy imposter?"
"204987124-0-50294";"<Recite the incantations.>"
"204987124-0-50298";"What can you tell me about Vivienne?"
"204987124-0-50302";"What kind of beast attacked you?"
"204987124-0-50304";"You're right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-50305";"I retrieved the Dawnstar gem when you dropped it. It led me right to you."
"204987124-0-50307";"Stay close. I'll get you out of here."
"204987124-0-50309";"What do the three Daedric Princes hope to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-50311";"How long before we can attempt to breach the barrier?"
"204987124-0-50312";"Money."
"204987124-0-50315";"For."
"204987124-0-50317";"Mischief"
"204987124-0-50318";"For."
"204987124-0-50319";"Money."
"204987124-0-50321";"For."
"204987124-0-50322";"Money."

"204987124-0-50326";"Mischief."
"204987124-0-50327";"Money."
"204987124-0-50328";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-50329";"What can you tell me about Vivienne?"
"204987124-0-50331";"Who is this expert?"
"204987124-0-50334";"Leythen's an expert on ancient languages?"
"204987124-0-50335";"I'll take the notes and talk to Leythen."
"204987124-0-50337";"How do these enchanted knives work?"
"204987124-0-50338";"What can you tell me about your brother?"
"204987124-0-50339";"You're joining the Sapiarchs?"
"204987124-0-50340";"How do you know your brother is here in Rellenthil?"
"204987124-0-50341";"Why does he want to join the House of Reveries?"
"204987124-0-50342";"What can you tell me about your brother?"
"204987124-0-50343";"A final audition?"
"204987124-0-50344";"I have to be sponsored by … Alchemy?"
"204987124-0-50348";"What challenge might that be?"
"204987124-0-50349";"What can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-50350";"What do you want to talk about?"
"204987124-0-50351";"What's an Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-50352";"Why does it matter that you found me?"
"204987124-0-50354";"Do all members of the House of Reveries make up stories?"
"204987124-0-50357";"What have you been able to learn about these necromancers?"
"204987124-0-50358";"Is the Dragon still here?"
"204987124-0-50359";"What does a sponsor do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-50360";"Can't you tell me anything about yourself?"
"204987124-0-50361";"What happens if the Grand Maestro judges me worthy?"
"204987124-0-50362";"What can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-50363";"Is that why you all wear masks?"
"204987124-0-50364";"I'd expect an Undaunted to be more eager for a fight."
"204987124-0-50365";"What does that have to do with anything?"
"204987124-0-50366";"What can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-50369";"So what do I do now?"
"204987124-0-50370";"So what do I do now?"
"204987124-0-50371";"So what do I do now?"
"204987124-0-50372";"Where do I find them?"
"204987124-0-50373";"What can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-50374";"Is there any other way I might recognize him?"
"204987124-0-50376";"I'll give your journal a look and see if I can identify Larydel."
"204987124-0-50382";"Do they mean to resurrect it?"
"204987124-0-50383";"Explain."
"204987124-0-50384";"Were you using necromancy just now?"
"204987124-0-50385";"Were you using necromancy just now?"
"204987124-0-50386";"Yes, let me see this book."
"204987124-0-50387";"What type of performance?"
"204987124-0-50389";"Go ahead. I'll follow your lead."
"204987124-0-50390";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-50392";"Let's go get the Heart back."
"204987124-0-50393";"Do you have any siblings?"
"204987124-0-50394";"Do you have any siblings?"
"204987124-0-50395";"Do you have any siblings?"
"204987124-0-50396";"Do you have any sisters?"
"204987124-0-50398";"Why did you have to practice in secret?"
"204987124-0-50401";"Do you want me to juggle while you swallow a sword?"
"204987124-0-50402";"All right, what do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-50404";"All right, I'll announce your performance."
"204987124-0-50405";"Never before have you witnessed such feats of physical dexterity!"
"204987124-0-50407";"This razor sharp blade is no match for our brave performer! How does she do it?"
"204987124-0-50408";"This razor sharp blade is no match for our brave performer! How does she do it?"
"204987124-0-50409";"This razor sharp blade is no match for our brave performer! How does she do it?"
"204987124-0-50410";"What amazing physical acumen! Have you ever seen a performance so impressive?"
"204987124-0-50411";"What amazing physical acumen! Have you ever seen a performance so impressive?"
"204987124-0-50412";"What amazing physical acumen! Have you ever seen a performance so impressive?"
"204987124-0-50414";"An astounding performance. Let's give her a hand!"
"204987124-0-50415";"What a spectacle! Let's hear it for Clever, the blade tamer!"
"204987124-0-50416";"That's it. The performance is over."
"204987124-0-50422";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50423";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50424";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50425";"Have you gotten close to the other members then?"
"204987124-0-50428";"All right. What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-50430";"All right, I'll drum for your performance."
"204987124-0-50432";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50433";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50434";"Do you have a sister?"
"204987124-0-50435";"That's quite the boast."
"204987124-0-50437";"Good luck with your audition. And here's your drum back."

"204987124-0-50446";"The Sapiarchs need talented mages."
"204987124-0-50447";"Will you let Rinyde speak to her brother?"
"204987124-0-50448";"Will you let Rinyde speak to her brother?"
"204987124-0-50449";"He's not Firebird."
"204987124-0-50450";"I don't think Rinyde will be dissuaded."
"204987124-0-50451";"No, Larydel's not Clever."
"204987124-0-50452";"It's not Feathermoth either."
"204987124-0-50453";"I don't think Rinyde will be dissuaded."
"204987124-0-50454";"I don't think Rinyde will be dissuaded."
"204987124-0-50455";"Yes. Larydel isn't among the Hopefuls I met."
"204987124-0-50456";"I'll tell Rinyde what you've told me."
"204987124-0-50458";"She said Larydel left because he envies you. He doesn't want to speak with you."
"204987124-0-50459";"She said Larydel should choose his own path. She asked us to let him do that."
"204987124-0-50465";"I believe he's Firebird."
"204987124-0-50466";"You plan to use a spell to unmask Larydel during his performance?"
"204987124-0-50468";"How do you manage to keep track of events on Nirn from wherever this is?"
"204987124-0-50470";"How did an Imperial end up in the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-50472";"You'd really force your brother to join the Sapiarchs against his wishes?"
"204987124-0-50473";"You'd really force your brother to join the Sapiarchs against his wishes?"
"204987124-0-50474";"You'd really force your brother to join the Sapiarchs against his wishes?"
"204987124-0-50475";"You'd really force your brother to join the Sapiarchs against his wishes?"
"204987124-0-50476";"All right. Let's find your friends."
"204987124-0-50489";"So you are Larydel in disguise."
"204987124-0-50490";"Why lie to her?"
"204987124-0-50491";"Tell her who you are and why you can't leave. She'll understand."
"204987124-0-50492";"How would you take her dream away?"
"204987124-0-50497";"Cast your spell. I'll take the stage and protect your Hopefuls."
"204987124-0-50500";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-50501";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-50502";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-50503";"Necromancy has no place in the world."
"204987124-0-50504";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-50505";"There are other necromancers in the Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-50506";"She'll be along shortly."
"204987124-0-50508";"While I cannot speak for Larydel, he will write you once you reach Lillandril."
"204987124-0-50510";"He wasn't in the cell for long. Did you take him?"
"204987124-0-50511";"Arathel insisted that he was involved in a plot to kill the Sapiarch when he turned himself in."
"204987124-0-50513";"So do you know where they took him?"
"204987124-0-50515";"How can I help with the ritual?"
"204987124-0-50516";"All right, tell me what you need me to do."
"204987124-0-50517";"And what is the augury's job exactly?"
"204987124-0-50521";"Then where is he?"
"204987124-0-50523";"I could use this map to track him down. Where is it?"
"204987124-0-50525";"Do you have any idea what happened to Arathel?"
"204987124-0-50526";"I'm looking for a High Elf called Arathel. His mother asked me to help find him."
"204987124-0-50527";"Mother?"
"204987124-0-50529";"Who are you, anyway?"
"204987124-0-50531";"Stay close. You'll be fine."
"204987124-0-50533";"Sure. Erudil is studying the book in the courtyard below."
"204987124-0-50539";"Why did Larydel leave?"
"204987124-0-50540";"Are you sure we should stop him?"
"204987124-0-50541";"I can travel to Rellenthil."
"204987124-0-50542";"I have a few questions before I head to Rellenthil."
"204987124-0-50543";"Do the Daedric Princes always work together?"
"204987124-0-50544";"What can you tell me about Rellenthil?"
"204987124-0-50548";"Other members of the cult mentioned that something was going to happen in Rellenthil."
"204987124-0-50551";"Right. That's where I was supposed to meet Valsirenn."
"204987124-0-50553";"What were you hoping to gain?"
"204987124-0-50554";"What did you mean when you said the Dragon was your prize?"
"204987124-0-50555";"Why did you become a lich?"
"204987124-0-50556";"Anything you could tell me about the Dragon that would be of help?"
"204987124-0-50557";"Thanks for the tip."
"204987124-0-50558";"You think I could turn them against him?"
"204987124-0-50560";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-50562";"Holy rituals?"
"204987124-0-50563";"What's next for you?"
"204987124-0-50564";"Got any leads?"
"204987124-0-50565";"What did you do to the Dragon bones?"
"204987124-0-50568";"You expect that to work?"
"204987124-0-50570";"All right, I'll distract Lindafwe while you sneak inside, then follow."
"204987124-0-50572";"Do you think the missing people, the sinkhole, and your son's friends are related?"
"204987124-0-50573";"Any objection to us investigating the sinkhole?"
"204987124-0-50574";"I'll let you know if we find anything to be concerned about."
"204987124-0-50576";"I have the official mandate right here."
"204987124-0-50577";"I'll let you know if we find anything to be concerned about."
"204987124-0-50579";"I can't say."
"204987124-0-50581";"Have it your way."
"204987124-0-50582";"You think the creatures inside the acropolis will wander?"
"204987124-0-50583";"You mentioned the Direnni. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-50584";"Why did a clan of Elves leave Summerset to settle in High Rock?"
"204987124-0-50587";"The Isle of Balfiera?"
"204987124-0-50589";"Did Thurvokun have a cult?"
"204987124-0-50593";"Was the Dragon War when you slew Thurvokun?"
"204987124-0-50594";"So you're ready to move on from this life?"
"204987124-0-50595";"For instance?"
"204987124-0-50597";"I won't forget what you did here. Thank you."
"204987124-0-50601";"What is the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-50603";"Why are you so interested in the situation here? Are you a vigilante or something?"
"204987124-0-50608";"Do you really think this sinkhole is that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-50612";"A hidden room here in the keep where that ritual took place. Silurie's tracking spell led me to it."
"204987124-0-50616";"I think you should start listening to Silurie."
"204987124-0-50618";"Let's just find this Daedra."
"204987124-0-50619";"Do you know where they went?"
"204987124-0-50621";"Don't move. I'll return with help."
"204987124-0-50628";"I found clay tracked around the secret room where that mage summoned the Insatiable."
"204987124-0-50629";"What's what?"
"204987124-0-50630";"Read this. Her name is Teraniel and she was sent to preoccupy the Cey-Tarn garrison."
"204987124-0-50631";"What was Teraniel trying to do to you two?"
"204987124-0-50632";"She was definitely doing this for some benefactor. There was mention of a court, but no specifics."
"204987124-0-50634";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-50635";"Teraniel wasn't working alone. Any idea who is behind all this?"
"204987124-0-50636";"It's about your perpetrator. She was part of the Court of Bedlam."
"204987124-0-50637";"Why won't the guards let you inside the keep?"
"204987124-0-50641";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-50644";"You didn't actually answer my question."
"204987124-0-50645";"So, the Illuminus is your story?"
"204987124-0-50651";"Why do you need to travel through the forest?"
"204987124-0-50652";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-50653";"Sure, I'll help."
"204987124-0-50665";"Do you remember coming to Ebon Stadmont?"
"204987124-0-50666";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-50669";"Perhaps it was the Daedra I just defeated?"
"204987124-0-50671";"Yes, that's where we found Fletch."
"204987124-0-50672";"I can do that for you."
"204987124-0-50674";"We'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-50675";"The stone in the temple sent us to the past?"
"204987124-0-50677";"All right, I'll use this stone to go back to the present."
"204987124-0-50678";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-50679";"Where?"
"204987124-0-50680";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-50692";"Isn't this language ancient? And not very well known?"
"204987124-0-50693";"Why are the Sea Sload dangerous?"
"204987124-0-50694";"Does this have something to do with the Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-0-50696";"Why are the Sea Sload dangerous?"
"204987124-0-50701";"Nedoril joined the Court of Bedlam. He killed a fellow initiate and was working with the Sload."
"204987124-0-50702";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-50705";"So, within legal reason, I can do whatever I want with the place?"
"204987124-0-50707";"Of course! I don't even worship Daedra."
"204987124-0-50710";"That's not something I can help you with."
"204987124-0-50711";"Your son has a lot to answer for, Canonreeve."
"204987124-0-50718";"Artists?"
"204987124-0-50720";"Do you mind if I look around for one anyway?"
"204987124-0-50721";"You lied about there being no aurialis."
"204987124-0-50722";"What sort of arrangement?"
"204987124-0-50723";"I'm interested. What are the details?"
"204987124-0-50725";"This might be the last aurialis?"
"204987124-0-50726";"I agreed to collect an aurialis. I'm keeping my word."
"204987124-0-50727";"This can't be the last aurialis plant on Summerset."
"204987124-0-50728";"Vaerelel?"
"204987124-0-50729";"Vaerelel?"
"204987124-0-50730";"All right, I accept your offer."
"204987124-0-50731";"Do you own the place?"
"204987124-0-50732";"Do you own the place?"
"204987124-0-50737";"It sounds like the triad of Daedric Princes isn't as united as we thought."
"204987124-0-50740";"What's a shame?"
"204987124-0-50742";"Why would Tindoria sabotage your farm?"
"204987124-0-50743";"Vaerelel was here?"
"204987124-0-50745";"I'll see if I can find out what happened to your livestock."
"204987124-0-50746";"Tindoria paid you to do this?"
"204987124-0-50749";"Fine. Get out of here before I change my mind."
"204987124-0-50752";"Tindoria needs your carapaces. Perhaps Vaerelel was trying to sabotage her."
"204987124-0-50755";"I'll make sure to relay the message."
"204987124-0-50756";"Tindoria hired me to collect your carapaces. Do you still have some to give?"
"204987124-0-50758";"Tindoria sent me. I'm here to purchase your rare dye."
"204987124-0-50759";"So, Tindoria was your student?"
"204987124-0-50760";"Actually, she gave me this tea. Is this an acceptable trade?"
"204987124-0-50763";"I don't know if I should trust you. I know you sabotaged Brodran's bug farm."
"204987124-0-50765";"I'm going to complete my contract with Tindoria."
"204987124-0-50766";"It wasn't Tindoria who told me."
"204987124-0-50770";"I couldn't acquire the aurialis. It seems to be going extinct."
"204987124-0-50771";"Also, Vaerelel poisoned the bugs on Brodran's bug farm. They won't mate."
"204987124-0-50772";"Also, Vaerelel poisoned the bugs on Brodran's bug farm. They won't mate."
"204987124-0-50773";"Haemalin was grateful for the tea."
"204987124-0-50775";"Well, here are the supplies you asked me to acquire."
"204987124-0-50782";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-50783";"And now?"
"204987124-0-50787";"Didn't the Ritemaster place protections on the pearl?"
"204987124-0-50788";"What is the Conclave of the Eleven Forces?"
"204987124-0-50795";"We need to be cautious. I wouldn't take anything the Court of Bedlam tells us at face value."
"204987124-0-50796";"I'll go and talk to Darien."
"204987124-0-50799";"You don't remember anything else?"
"204987124-0-50800";"Maybe we should leave the Heart of Transparent Law hidden away."
"204987124-0-50809";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-50810";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-50812";"I can destroy the pearl."
"204987124-0-50813";"But you did escape."
"204987124-0-50815";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-50817";"How so?"
"204987124-0-50818";"Understood."
"204987124-0-50819";"We have to stop them. Where is the Sea Mage now?"
"204987124-0-50820";"How do we find the Heart?"
"204987124-0-50829";"Darien and I will scout ahead."
"204987124-0-50830";"What about Pandermalion?"
"204987124-0-50831";"Good luck to you."
"204987124-0-50837";"Should we keep going?"
"204987124-0-50839";"Do you remember anything else?"
"204987124-0-50841";"So the Heart is on the other side of this portal?"
"204987124-0-50842";"Then open the portal and let's go find the Heart."
"204987124-0-50843";"What about Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-50845";"Is there a particular relic the Sea Sload seeks?"
"204987124-0-50846";"The Maormer may have gotten the best of him, but it was Pandermalion's plan that saved the day."
"204987124-0-50847";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-50852";"A Dragon Priest?"
"204987124-0-50859";"What's special about this particular Dragon Priest?"
"204987124-0-50860";"But you originally came here to study a Dragon Priest?"
"204987124-0-50861";"They're planning to spread it?"
"204987124-0-50862";"So, you're saying the Ghost of the Green had an accomplice?"
"204987124-0-50864";"What are the Orbs of B'Raken Drel?"
"204987124-0-50865";"So you think Halimorion had it coming?"
"204987124-0-50866";"So Halimorion treated Wood Elves poorly. You think that's why he was murdered?"
"204987124-0-50869";"Can you tell me more about Dragon Priests?"
"204987124-0-50870";"I'll find the Ul'vor Staff."
"204987124-0-50872";"Can you tell me more about Ila?"
"204987124-0-50873";"One of your servants went missing?"
"204987124-0-50874";"If I see her, I'll let her know you were looking for her."
"204987124-0-50875";"If she stopped working for Halimorion, why would she be here?"
"204987124-0-50876";"So we're going to enter the Ritemaster's mind?"
"204987124-0-50878";"How can I hurt K'Tora in the mindscape?"
"204987124-0-50879";"What should I know about Lodiss?"
"204987124-0-50880";"Can you tell me more about Ila?"
"204987124-0-50881";"Can you tell me more about Ila?"
"204987124-0-50882";"Why would the thief hide the relics?"
"204987124-0-50884";"All right, I'll read the book."
"204987124-0-50885";"You could have prevented this."
"204987124-0-50886";"That back door is quite a vulnerability. Why didn't you seal it off completely?"
"204987124-0-50888";"Of course?"
"204987124-0-50890";"Any ideas?"
"204987124-0-50891";"Are you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me?"
"204987124-0-50892";"Is there anything else you can tell me about the relics?"
"204987124-0-50893";"Incessant … lute playing?"
"204987124-0-50895";"All right. So I should just put the relic back in its display case?"
"204987124-0-50897";"Do you think your son could be responsible for Halimorion's death?"
"204987124-0-50898";"Are you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me?"
"204987124-0-50901";"He hid the Heart in his own chest. Nocturnal tore it out and killed him."
"204987124-0-50902";"I don't think the triad exists any more. Nocturnal took the Heart for herself."
"204987124-0-50904";"We have to find another way to stop Nocturnal."
"204987124-0-50905";"All right. I'll follow you to this Red Temple."
"204987124-0-50906";"They didn't really leave us a choice."
"204987124-0-50907";"K'Tora made a deal with Daedric Princes and altered the Ritemaster's memories."
"204987124-0-50909";"K'Tora wanted to learn where the Ritemaster hid something called the Heart of Transparent Law."
"204987124-0-50911";"What's the significance of the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"204987124-0-50916";"Farril? The Bosmer girl that was murdered?"
"204987124-0-50917";"Celan?"
"204987124-0-50918";"Tell me who the real Ghost is. The one who recruited you."
"204987124-0-50920";"He killed Halimorion, but only after he was recruited by this other Ghost of the Green."
"204987124-0-50924";"You're just going to leave? But I thought you had information to share with the Ritemaster?"
"204987124-0-50925";"He told me to tell you that your ""past is hunting your present."""
"204987124-0-50926";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-50927";"How?"
"204987124-0-50931";"We need your help to stop Nocturnal. Tell me what you were going to tell the Ritemaster."
"204987124-0-50933";"What will amplifying the Crystal Tower do?"
"204987124-0-50937";"I saw Nocturnal banish Mephala and Vile from her realm. I don't think she's still part of your team."
"204987124-0-50938";"Tell me what the Princes were originally planning or I'll turn you back over to Valsirenn."
"204987124-0-50939";"First, tell me the triad's original plan."
"204987124-0-50940";"Where are the Sapiarchs attempting the attuning ritual?"
"204987124-0-50941";"I'll meet you at the Crystal Tower Gatehouse."
"204987124-0-50943";"So we can use this altar to open a portal to the Gorge?"
"204987124-0-50944";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-50945";"Sotha Sil says she could use the Crystal Tower to become infinitely powerful."
"204987124-0-50947";"The Sapiarchs are trying to create a new pair of sentinels so we can enter the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-50948";"Let's go to the gatehouse."
"204987124-0-50950";"Tell me more about this ritual."
"204987124-0-50951";"What are you all doing out here?"
"204987124-0-50952";"Yes. Tell me what happened here."
"204987124-0-50953";"I'm sorry, but I have to know—who are the Keepers?"
"204987124-0-50954";"How do I find this vault?"
"204987124-0-50955";"I thought you said she was your apprentice."
"204987124-0-50957";"Fine. What about the cultists here? What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-50958";"Why does the Thieves Guild want these tokens of Meridia anyway?"
"204987124-0-50959";"What will happen if I burn your body?"
"204987124-0-50961";"First chapter? Lady Twilight?"
"204987124-0-50964";"Will you keep training her?"
"204987124-0-50966";"Do you have any idea what happened to this Meridia cult?"
"204987124-0-50967";"We could try Leythen's suggestion and seek help from Mephala and Clavicus Vile."
"204987124-0-50969";"I'll go to Alinor and warn the Proxy Queen."
"204987124-0-50971";"What does Clavicus Vile want to talk about?"
"204987124-0-50972";"You certainly are confident."
"204987124-0-50973";"Why would I sell Tindoria's supplies to you?"
"204987124-0-50974";"You certainly seem to hate her."
"204987124-0-50975";"So how do I talk to Clavicus Vile?"
"204987124-0-50976";"I'll go to the caves and talk to Clavicus Vile."
"204987124-0-50977";"Didn't you want to reveal the untold story?"
"204987124-0-50978";"Tell me about the Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-0-50979";"So if we scratch your back, you'll scratch ours."
"204987124-0-50982";"Maybe Enigma would find inspiration in your Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-0-50983";"Are you suggesting that Vindilween isn't trustworthy?"
"204987124-0-50984";"Five weeks? That's not what we agreed to."
"204987124-0-50985";"Courtier Vindilween sent us. She suggested you might require a favor."
"204987124-0-50986";"I think Essence of Mammoth would be perfect for inspiring Enigma's performance."
"204987124-0-50987";"Maybe Enigma would find inspiration in your Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-0-50988";"Let's give the Essence of Mammoth to Enigma. She'll love it!"
"204987124-0-50989";"Courtier Vindilween sent us. She suggested you might require a favor."
"204987124-0-50990";"What if I did the contract for you?"
"204987124-0-50991";"How so?"
"204987124-0-50992";"I'll get you the heart if you meet with Tableau."
"204987124-0-50993";"What are we looking for exactly? I don't know much about indriks."
"204987124-0-50995";"Tell me about Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-0-50996";"Tell me about Essence of Mammoth."
"204987124-0-50997";"Tell me about Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-0-50999";"You should stick with us. It's dangerous to be alone out here."
"204987124-0-51000";"All right."
"204987124-0-51003";"Manacar sent me. Do her other friends know about him?"
"204987124-0-51005";"Why go through all that trouble?"
"204987124-0-51006";"I'll speak to Tableau and let her know your decision."
"204987124-0-51013";"How can you complain that he's not respecting your wishes, when you refuse to respect his?"
"204987124-0-51015";"Trust in what Tableau says. There's more memories to make yet."
"204987124-0-51017";"What's so important about your notes that you'd risk your life?"
"204987124-0-51019";"I'll gather your notes for you."
"204987124-0-51020";"You're abandoning him?"
"204987124-0-51022";"All right, I'll bring the notes to Mehdze."
"204987124-0-51023";"Actually, I have all your notes here."
"204987124-0-51027";"Hold on, I think you're getting ahead of yourself."
"204987124-0-51029";"Can you tell me more about Grand Maestro Forte's expedition?"
"204987124-0-51030";"I'll find the strange dog. You go warn the Proxy Queen."
"204987124-0-51032";"The Mother of Rats?"
"204987124-0-51034";"Can we talk to her? Find out if she knows anything?"
"204987124-0-51039";"The Crystal Tower is in danger. The Ritemaster sent me to warn the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-51040";"Is there anything I should know about the College of Sapiarchs?"
"204987124-0-51041";"The Crystal Tower is in danger. The Ritemaster sent me to warn the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-51042";"Is there anything I should know about the College of Sapiarchs?"
"204987124-0-51043";"I'm getting the sense I may have offended you in some way."
"204987124-0-51045";"I'll head to Lillandril immediately."
"204987124-0-51046";"I'm getting the sense I may have offended you in some way."
"204987124-0-51048";"I'll travel to Lillandril immediately."
"204987124-0-51049";"How do we get to the Sapiarchs' compound?"
"204987124-0-51051";"I'm ready to go to the College now."
"204987124-0-51052";"Who are these mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-51053";"The truth should be heard. You could give a voice to the voiceless."
"204987124-0-51055";"Best of luck with your performance."
"204987124-0-51056";"Best of luck with your performance."
"204987124-0-51058";"Is she always so brusque?"
"204987124-0-51059";"I came to warn you about the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-51060";"Where can I find Mirulon?"
"204987124-0-51062";"I'll enter the Labyrinth and find Sapiarch Larnatille."
"204987124-0-51063";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-51065";"What did you mean when you said that Mirulon aims to bend Arathel's mind?"
"204987124-0-51066";"Why should I trust anything you say?"
"204987124-0-51067";"All right. So tell me how I can enter the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-51070";"I think the Depressing Stuffed Goat would make the perfect gift for Justiciar Rolumdel."
"204987124-0-51071";"Let's give the Stuffed Goat and the recovered items to Justiciar Rolumdel."
"204987124-0-51072";"I think the Depressing Stuffed Goat would make the perfect gift for Justiciar Rolumdel."
"204987124-0-51073";"I think the Depressing Stuffed Goat would make the perfect gift for Justiciar Rolumdel."
"204987124-0-51074";"Ambassador Rigurt comes from Skyrim. He might be able to help you with that."
"204987124-0-51076";"Maybe the Sapiarch would appreciate your Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-0-51077";"I think Dibella's Bosom Night Favor would make the perfect gift for the Sapiarch."
"204987124-0-51078";"Let's give the Night Favor and the other cultural items to the Sapiarch."
"204987124-0-51079";"Maybe the Sapiarch would appreciate your Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-0-51082";"Is there something I can help you with?"
"204987124-0-51084";"Tell me about Leythen."
"204987124-0-51087";"You lost your daughter?"
"204987124-0-51092";"Why are you trying to make a record of the battles that occurred here?"
"204987124-0-51093";"What's that have to do with Goblins?"
"204987124-0-51094";"Why choose to assist him then?"
"204987124-0-51096";"I'm willing to pay handsomely for it. Surely you could use the gold out here."
"204987124-0-51097";"Will this buy me your Breton cultural item?"
"204987124-0-51098";"Sapiarch Tandemen would be extremely grateful if you let him have your navigation stone."
"204987124-0-51102";"Do you think the Sapiarchs are still alive?"
"204987124-0-51104";"What does this mean for you?"
"204987124-0-51105";"What happens to Lotus now?"
"204987124-0-51109";"I don't have anything that can help you."
"204987124-0-51110";"You don't think this could have been a lovers' quarrel?"
"204987124-0-51111";"I found Talomar just outside the grounds, looking for Lotus."
"204987124-0-51112";"I understand."
"204987124-0-51113";"But the diamond keys need to be attuned and the tower sentinels are dead."
"204987124-0-51114";"And what do you get in return for this favor?"
"204987124-0-51116";"Is that really such a good idea?"
"204987124-0-51121";"So you believe that Nocturnal betrayed your Prince now?"
"204987124-0-51124";"Three Daedric Princes worked with the Sea Sloads to steal the Heart of Transparent Law."
"204987124-0-51125";"Why would she throw us out in the middle of a crisis?"
"204987124-0-51126";"Why does the door concern you?"
"204987124-0-51128";"The Ritemaster is trying to locate the Heart. We need to keep the Daedric Princes out of the tower."
"204987124-0-51129";"No one else can use the diamonds?"
"204987124-0-51130";"That isn't suspicious to anyone else?"
"204987124-0-51131";"No one else can use the diamonds?"
"204987124-0-51132";"Being a tower sentinel is a secret?"
"204987124-0-51133";"Tell me more about Hannayel and Imedril."
"204987124-0-51134";"Then why does this Daedric cultist want the diamonds?"
"204987124-0-51135";"You won't have any trouble getting him back to the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-51137";"So you betrayed the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-51139";"What can you tell me about Vivienne?"
"204987124-0-51141";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-51143";"All right, let's give it a try."
"204987124-0-51147";"Vile offered passage to the Crystal Tower through his realm, but we need to attune the diamond keys."
"204987124-0-51148";"Can you make the diamond keys work so we can enter the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-51150";"We'll contact you again when we're ready."
"204987124-0-51151";"Clavicus Vile offered to let us use his realm to reach the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-51152";"Mephala might be able to help us attune the Resolute Diamonds."
"204987124-0-51154";"All right, I will search there."
"204987124-0-51155";"There are two Sapiarchs. They guard the diamond keys that can open the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-51156";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-51157";"Do you think she left the Academy compound?"
"204987124-0-51159";"Here, this book should fill you in."
"204987124-0-51160";"Something led you to this temple, all in an attempt to trap you here."
"204987124-0-51162";"That book should fill you in on the details, but for now we must leave."
"204987124-0-51164";"Why are you so concerned about this one in particular?"
"204987124-0-51165";"Any idea how all these animals escaped?"
"204987124-0-51166";"You said she's been here ten years, but she's still a junior keeper?"
"204987124-0-51168";"All right. If what you say is true, I need to see it myself."
"204987124-0-51169";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-51170";"If that's true, they'd also remember what Vinelore did to them."
"204987124-0-51176";"I made a deal with Vile to reach the Crystal Tower and Mephala is considering attuning the diamonds."
"204987124-0-51179";"Daedric Princes, actually. Where can I find Imedril?"
"204987124-0-51180";"I'll go to King's Haven and check on the Sapiarch."
"204987124-0-51181";"What happened to the Golden Knight?"
"204987124-0-51182";"Rest easy, tower sentinel."
"204987124-0-51183";"Mephala dragged the Golden Knight into her realm after he dropped this gem."
"204987124-0-51184";"You said it will be harder to access the Crystal Tower now?"
"204987124-0-51187";"What does all of that mean?"
"204987124-0-51188";"I'll go and check on Oracle Marieve."
"204987124-0-51194";"What does all of that mean?"
"204987124-0-51195";"I'll go and check on Oracle Marieve."
"204987124-0-51196";"What kind of superstitions?"
"204987124-0-51197";"What makes you different?"
"204987124-0-51198";"Why does she want the pearl?"
"204987124-0-51199";"What mysteries are you hoping to uncover?"
"204987124-0-51200";"If I find out otherwise, you're going to regret lying to me about it."
"204987124-0-51201";"Why do you assume these people are up to no good?"
"204987124-0-51207";"What sort of dealings did Emile have with Galidor?"
"204987124-0-51209";"All right, I'll learn the passphrase and investigate the ledger."
"204987124-0-51210";"All right. I can look into this business with Galidor. Where should I start?"
"204987124-0-51217";"So you're just giving up?"
"204987124-0-51230";"You can hide your true nature and return to Shimmerene. Control is possible."
"204987124-0-51231";"Do you have any theories at all?"
"204987124-0-51232";"Take control of your fate. Live how you want."
"204987124-0-51233";"Tell me more about Oracle Marieve."
"204987124-0-51234";"All right. Give me the enchanted boat and I'll be off."
"204987124-0-51235";"Can you tell me more about your companions?"
"204987124-0-51236";"So the cult wasn't expecting this behavior?"
"204987124-0-51238";"Nocturnal plans to use the Crystal Tower and the Sea Sloads' abyssal pearls to remake reality."
"204987124-0-51243";"She sold the pearl to pay off her sister's drug debt."
"204987124-0-51245";"Why does she want the pearl?"
"204987124-0-51246";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"204987124-0-51247";"So what do we do to stop this?"
"204987124-0-51255";"The decor? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-51261";"You want to drive off the Maormer?"
"204987124-0-51262";"Let's search for the other survivors then."
"204987124-0-51263";"You think they're in danger?"
"204987124-0-51264";"Could this plague have been dormant until the sinkholes exposed it to the surface?"
"204987124-0-51269";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-51271";"If the Sapiarchs want to research the pearl, why should I destroy it?"
"204987124-0-51273";"What can the two of us do about it?"
"204987124-0-51274";"Why does that matter?"
"204987124-0-51275";"So what do you suggest I do?"
"204987124-0-51278";"How does a Dragon Priest fit into this?"
"204987124-0-51282";"How did he strike you? Coherent? Remorseful?"
"204987124-0-51283";"What do you know about this Saltbreeze Cave?"
"204987124-0-51284";"Any idea where Emile and Haladan were prior to the murder?"
"204987124-0-51285";"What did you hope to accomplish with the Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-0-51286";"So this is your first time facing the end of the world?"
"204987124-0-51287";"You didn't go in?"
"204987124-0-51291";"Let's go to the Dreaming Cave and make sure that doesn't happen."
"204987124-0-51292";"You said the Sapiarchs refused to investigate?"
"204987124-0-51293";"You saw Haladan's body. What do you think happened to him?"
"204987124-0-51294";"He's a powerful mage. Maybe some kind of spell?"
"204987124-0-51295";"We're going to assault the Crystal Tower and stop Nocturnal."
"204987124-0-51296";"How do you know about this seaside cave?"
"204987124-0-51298";"You have happy news?"
"204987124-0-51299";"Are you going to come with me to the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-51300";"And what's the not-so-happy news?"
"204987124-0-51303";"You're upset because no one is celebrating?"
"204987124-0-51304";"How long have you been underground?"
"204987124-0-51305";"You can count on me."
"204987124-0-51306";"Do you plan on drinking innocent people's blood?"
"204987124-0-51307";"Tell me about this affliction they were treating."
"204987124-0-51308";"Your duty?"
"204987124-0-51309";"All the more reason for me to find them."
"204987124-0-51313";"It just seems rather convenient, a voice telling us where to go."
"204987124-0-51314";"How can you be sure?"
"204987124-0-51316";"… And?"
"204987124-0-51317";"No."
"204987124-0-51321";"Sure, I'll be your second. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-51322";"What are these customs?"
"204987124-0-51323";"Will this be enough?"
"204987124-0-51327";"What else do we need?"
"204987124-0-51328";"Why did he want you to leave?"
"204987124-0-51329";"It seems like you'd have hired more people for a job as dangerous as this."
"204987124-0-51330";"Tell me what you want."
"204987124-0-51331";"I can only speak for myself. Attune the diamonds as you have said and Leythen can come with me."
"204987124-0-51333";"It seems like you'd have hired more people for a job as dangerous as this."
"204987124-0-51335";"Has becoming a vampire cured you?"
"204987124-0-51337";"Jorvuld's right. You've let your own greed blind you."
"204987124-0-51338";"The end doesn't justify the means, Ila."
"204987124-0-51339";"Has becoming a vampire cured you?"
"204987124-0-51344";"You'd really feel safer alone?"
"204987124-0-51346";"Took the sickness? You mean they cured the Thrassian Plague?"
"204987124-0-51347";"Did you see them take a High Elf through here recently?"
"204987124-0-51348";"Do you know how I can open them?"
"204987124-0-51350";"I think so. Henrigg and Mindoril suffered the worst of it."
"204987124-0-51351";"The lost people of Corgrad were trying to revive their masters. I put a stop to it."
"204987124-0-51358";"What will you do in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-51360";"Isn't that why you were so quickly outnumbered? Isn't that why Ludovic died?"
"204987124-0-51361";"It's not to late to make amends and be a better leader."
"204987124-0-51363";"And you think Scalecaller has it?"
"204987124-0-51365";"Well, what about the damage to Haladan's reputation, and the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-51366";"Will he ever go free?"
"204987124-0-51369";"Aren't you supposed to come with us?"
"204987124-0-51370";"What can we expect inside the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-51372";"We're going inside now."
"204987124-0-51375";"What do you mean by clean-cut?"
"204987124-0-51379";"And what will you do with this freedom?"
"204987124-0-51380";"And you would stay that way forever?"
"204987124-0-51381";"And?"
"204987124-0-51382";"Then she returned?"
"204987124-0-51383";"Why did she specifically mention me?"
"204987124-0-51388";"Please, we have to keep going up if we're going to stop Nocturnal."
"204987124-0-51389";"She didn't try to talk them out of it?"
"204987124-0-51394";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-51395";"Did Summerset turn out how you imagined?"
"204987124-0-51402";"What did Olnewil speak out about and where can I find her?"
"204987124-0-51403";"I'll go talk to Olnewil, Rhanul, and Tsoxolza."
"204987124-0-51404";"What's the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-51405";"Rhanul? That doesn't sound like a High Elf name."
"204987124-0-51406";"If you think the Oracle is in danger, why didn't you bring her here?"
"204987124-0-51407";"And what do I do with the medallion of summoning again?"
"204987124-0-51408";"And what were those thoughts, if you don't mind me asking?"
"204987124-0-51409";"You're not a High Elf. Have you lived in Summerset very long?"
"204987124-0-51410";"Do you like living in Summerset?"
"204987124-0-51412";"What did you say exactly, if you don't mind me asking?"
"204987124-0-51413";"You're not a High Elf. Have you lived in Summerset very long?"
"204987124-0-51417";"Do you think the Daedra harmed the Oracle?"
"204987124-0-51426";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-51427";"I heard you made complaints in Shimmerene. I'd like to hear about that."
"204987124-0-51428";"What happened to your apprentice?"
"204987124-0-51431";"Who are these chaos-bringers that the Oracle mentioned?"
"204987124-0-51432";"How are you going to do that?"
"204987124-0-51434";"Sotha Sil said we needed a relic with divine energy to repair the Transparent Law crystal."
"204987124-0-51443";"How can I stop it?"
"204987124-0-51444";"I'll handle it. You should flee this place."
"204987124-0-51448";"Darien, what are you saying?"
"204987124-0-51460";"Where is Artaeum exactly?"
"204987124-0-51463";"Leythen gave his life so we could reach the top of the tower."
"204987124-0-51467";"We lost friends along the way, though."
"204987124-0-51468";"So what happens next?"
"204987124-0-51469";"Won't Nocturnal just try again?"
"204987124-0-51471";"What's your role here?"
"204987124-0-51472";"Who are the Sapiarchs?"
"204987124-0-51474";"So Lorne doesn't use magic in her investigations?"
"204987124-0-51475";"Tell me about the Aldarch and the new monks."
"204987124-0-51476";"So you interact with the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-51479";"Tell me about the Aldarch and the new monks."
"204987124-0-51480";"Strange? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-51481";"And my reward?"
"204987124-0-51489";"Hopefully, so will my reward."
"204987124-0-51493";"The Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-51498";"Why did the Academy invite you?"
"204987124-0-51499";"But I thought you were taking records of the wars between High Elves and Goblins?"
"204987124-0-51500";"The Isle of Balfiera?"
"204987124-0-51501";"Really? That's all?"
"204987124-0-51502";"Fine, but I have to know. Why do they call you Rock?"
"204987124-0-51503";"And now?"
"204987124-0-51504";"What are you all doing out here?"
"204987124-0-51505";"Could that be what's affecting the animals?"
"204987124-0-51508";"Tell me more about the war you're trying to end."
"204987124-0-51509";"You really think you can get Queen Ayrenn to sign a peace treaty?"
"204987124-0-51510";"Tell me more about Courtier Vindilween."
"204987124-0-51511";"Why can't you talk to the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-0-51512";"Why can't you talk to the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-0-51513";"What?"
"204987124-0-51515";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-51517";"Tell me more about the items you want Rigurt to acquire."
"204987124-0-51518";"Can you tell me more about your life as an artist?"
"204987124-0-51519";"And these ingredients will help you achieve this goal?"
"204987124-0-51520";"Will you become a noble or something?"
"204987124-0-51521";"Can you tell me more about the ingredients?"
"204987124-0-51522";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-51525";"Actually, I have all your notes here."
"204987124-0-51526";"And why did you scatter trade shipments throughout the cave?"
"204987124-0-51527";"Why did she choose now to mutiny?"
"204987124-0-51528";"He's a smuggler? He told me he was a trader."
"204987124-0-51529";"Force his paw? With what?"
"204987124-0-51530";"No. I made a deal with Renzir, and I'm going to honor that."
"204987124-0-51532";"What did you mean by darker forces?"
"204987124-0-51534";"Won't dumping these shipments leave you destitute?"
"204987124-0-51535";"You didn't mention these shipments were smuggled into Summerset."
"204987124-0-51536";"Nubani wanted me to destroy them so you'd have to sell your ship."
"204987124-0-51539";"Nubani believes you can make it on your own by living honestly. Trust her opinion."
"204987124-0-51540";"And as for my share?"
"204987124-0-51541";"Tell me about Sapiarch Tandemen."
"204987124-0-51542";"How do we get the Sapiarch to give Rigurt a recommendation?"
"204987124-0-51543";"Another favor?"
"204987124-0-51544";"How am I supposed to get tickets if they're that hard to come by?"
"204987124-0-51545";"Who's Justiciar Rolumdel?"
"204987124-0-51546";"Something about a warning, and she seemed pretty interested in the life-sucking pearl."
"204987124-0-51547";"Tell me about Sapiarch Tandemen."
"204987124-0-51548";"The Crystal Tower's wards have weakened. We must convince the Sapiarchs to gather allies."
"204987124-0-51549";"Does Summerset have a Daedra problem?"
"204987124-0-51551";"Shouldn't you speak to the Kinlady? You do work for the Queen, after all."
"204987124-0-51553";"Why do you think newcomers are well-suited for these tasks?"
"204987124-0-51554";"So what does the Divine Prosecution actually do?"
"204987124-0-51555";"Does it bother you to seek outside help?"
"204987124-0-51556";"Tell me about the Divine Prosecution."
"204987124-0-51558";"Tell me about Sapiarch Tandemen."
"204987124-0-51559";"You wouldn't seek revenge?"
"204987124-0-51560";"So does that mean they won't make trouble for us anymore?"
"204987124-0-51561";"Do you think Nocturnal will strike again?"
"204987124-0-51562";"I suppose you have a particular Khajiit, Breton, and Argonian in mind?"
"204987124-0-51563";"Before you go, Valsirenn wants you to join a council she's putting together."
"204987124-0-51570";"What do you mean by ""accept pledges""?"
"204987124-0-51571";"What really happened here?"
"204987124-0-51572";"If you'll excuse me, Aldarch Tilcalar, I just remembered I have someplace else to be."
"204987124-0-51575";"How do I join?"
"204987124-0-51576";"What have you been able to learn about these necromancers?"
"204987124-0-51577";"What will happen if I burn your body?"
"204987124-0-51579";"What will happen if I light the brazier?"
"204987124-0-51580";"How do you feel about your sister now?"
"204987124-0-51587";"The Ritemaster wasn't in control of his actions."
"204987124-0-51589";"The Conclave made you the Ritemaster?"
"204987124-0-51590";"Without the actions of the Psijic Order, the Crystal Tower would have fallen to Nocturnal."
"204987124-0-51591";"The Psijic Order helped me stop the Daedric Princes. Without them the tower would have fallen."
"204987124-0-51592";"The Sapiarchs can't protect the Crystal Tower alone."
"204987124-0-51593";"I think you're making a mistake."
"204987124-0-51594";"So that's it?"
"204987124-0-51596";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-51605";"I only know that the Dragon abandoned her a long, long time ago."
"204987124-0-51608";"Any idea who stole the cup and bowl?"
"204987124-0-51611";"Do the Daedric Princes always work together?"
"204987124-0-51616";"How so?"
"204987124-0-51617";"You should stay. You can make sure the animals are really cared for here."
"204987124-0-51618";"I can't think of anyone better."
"204987124-0-51619";"This place has been a cage for you both. You're free to make a fresh start now."
"204987124-0-51621";"You don't find that suspicious?"
"204987124-0-51622";"What do you make of all this?"
"204987124-0-51624";"Do you have any advice for me?"
"204987124-0-51628";"I'll go to Alinor and warn the Proxy Queen."
"204987124-0-51630";"Can you tell me about Vaeralel and Tindoria's relationship?"
"204987124-0-51631";"Can't you deputize the native High Elves?"
"204987124-0-51632";"So you're a judge?"
"204987124-0-51633";"So, Tindoria was your student?"
"204987124-0-51634";"You seem somewhat reluctant to accept the help of a newcomer."
"204987124-0-51635";"But you're willing to ask a High Elf newcomer for help?"
"204987124-0-51636";"What's a justiciar?"
"204987124-0-51637";"Where did they go?"
"204987124-0-51638";"I'll look for Darien and Leythen in northwestern Summerset."
"204987124-0-51642";"What can you tell me about your brother?"
"204987124-0-51644";"Someone who loved you?"
"204987124-0-51647";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-51652";"That doesn't mean they aren't dangerous."
"204987124-0-51653";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-51654";"And Soravil blames you for that?"
"204987124-0-51658";"Will Nocturnal's earl try to stop us?"
"204987124-0-51661";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-51666";"Can you tell me about the language?"
"204987124-0-51667";"How will the inscriptions help us find the temple?"
"204987124-0-51668";"Can you tell me more about the temple?"
"204987124-0-51669";"Speaking of the inscriptions, what can you tell me about the language here?"
"204987124-0-51670";"Inaccessible? How so?"
"204987124-0-51671";"Speaking to you?"
"204987124-0-51672";"Can you tell me more about Ebon Stadmont?"
"204987124-0-51674";"Can you tell me more about Ebon Stadmont?"
"204987124-0-51675";"What did you do to the Dragon bones?"
"204987124-0-51676";"Why did they imprison you?"
"204987124-0-51678";"Are you upset to be going back to Telenger?"
"204987124-0-51680";"I could see where that would put you off."
"204987124-0-51681";"What did Olnewil speak out about and where can I find her?"
"204987124-0-51682";"I've rarely seen you this serious."
"204987124-0-51683";"Is there anything else you need from me right now?"
"204987124-0-51684";"People are disappearing on your estate. Doesn't that concern you?"
"204987124-0-51685";"What about Erilthel? You don't seem very worried about her."
"204987124-0-51686";"How is your injury?"
"204987124-0-51687";"How is your injury?"
"204987124-0-51688";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"204987124-0-51689";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-51691";"I'll locate the three adventurers and find out what they uncovered."
"204987124-0-51692";"Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-0-51693";"I met Cainar, Grog, and Miriya at the Eldbur Ruins."
"204987124-0-51694";"Do you know anything else about the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-0-51695";"Who captured Grog and where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-51696";"How are you going to investigate K'Garza?"
"204987124-0-51697";"All right, I'll go rescue Grog."
"204987124-0-51698";"Thank you, Prince Mephala."
"204987124-0-51699";"Summerset's in danger and time is of the essence. Tell me what you learned."
"204987124-0-51701";"What did the Sload and the High Elf talk about?"
"204987124-0-51703";"Geysers? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-51704";"Is there anything I can do for your injuries?"
"204987124-0-51708";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-51709";"And this is a problem?"
"204987124-0-51710";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-51711";"Tell me about the Queen's decree."
"204987124-0-51719";"And?"
"204987124-0-51720";"Are you sure you can win this duel?"
"204987124-0-51721";"And that was the last straw."
"204987124-0-51722";"The Face-Demolisher?"
"204987124-0-51724";"You must have some idea where they're sequestering the newcomers."
"204987124-0-51725";"Magic ale?"
"204987124-0-51726";"Don't be too hard on yourself. So, what happened with this Elf exactly?"
"204987124-0-51727";"You think she was making it up?"
"204987124-0-51728";"Why did your marriage negotiations take decades to arrange?"
"204987124-0-51729";"Right, back on the task at hand. What can you tell me about Niralin?"
"204987124-0-51730";"Right, let's get back to the task at hand. What can you tell me about Niralin?"
"204987124-0-51731";"Sounds complicated."
"204987124-0-51732";"Are you still willing to marry her?"
"204987124-0-51733";"Right, your engagement. And that took … decades to be arranged?"
"204987124-0-51734";"Sounds complicated."
"204987124-0-51735";"You're still willing to marry Niralin, after all this?"
"204987124-0-51736";"Right. Your marriage that took … decades to plan?"
"204987124-0-51738";"All right, open the gate."
"204987124-0-51739";"Report?"
"204987124-0-51740";"So that's it? There's nothing we can do?"
"204987124-0-51741";"Inebriation?"
"204987124-0-51742";"Thanks for giving us a fighting chance."
"204987124-0-51743";"What should I tell Valsirenn?"
"204987124-0-51744";"What should I tell Valsirenn?"
"204987124-0-51745";"Thank you, Leythen."
"204987124-0-51746";"I met Cainar, Grog, and Miriya at the Eldbur Ruins."
"204987124-0-51747";"Tell me more about the three adventurers who volunteered to help you."
"204987124-0-51748";"Tell me more about the three adventurers who volunteered to help you."
"204987124-0-51749";"What do you mean that Grog is chained up as a gift to appease the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-0-51750";"How are you going to investigate K'Garza?"
"204987124-0-51751";"How are you going to investigate K'Garza?"
"204987124-0-51757";"Grog did send me to find this journal."
"204987124-0-51758";"Fine. What did this book do?"
"204987124-0-51759";"All right, I'll help you break this enchantment. I need more details, though. What happened exactly?"
"204987124-0-51763";"How will you respond to the Sea Sload threat?"
"204987124-0-51767";"Outcasts? In what way?"
"204987124-0-51768";"Why do you want to meet one?"
"204987124-0-51769";"What can you tell me about Lorne and Soravil?"
"204987124-0-51770";"So you're not actually in charge here?"
"204987124-0-51771";"A mind like a puzzle box?"
"204987124-0-51772";"Can't you send soldiers to destroy the abyssal geysers?"
"204987124-0-51774";"You seem matter of fact about it."
"204987124-0-51775";"Yet nobles still hire you for contracts."
"204987124-0-51776";"What about this murder reminds you of the Ghost of the Green?"
"204987124-0-51778";"What can you tell me about the new Aldarch?"
"204987124-0-51779";"How do you feel about the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-51781";"What's a canonreeve?"
"204987124-0-51782";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-51783";"I'll go to Artaeum to talk to the Ritemaster after I check in with Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-51784";"Is something wrong?"
"204987124-0-51787";"How long have you been here on Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-51788";"Any idea how all these animals escaped?"
"204987124-0-51789";"You said there are undead here?"
"204987124-0-51790";"You talk about the Order like you're not a part of it."
"204987124-0-51791";"Why haven't the Psijics cleared them out?"
"204987124-0-51792";"Lorne told me about her husband—and your wife."
"204987124-0-51795";"The Worm King?"
"204987124-0-51796";"You're not bothered by necromancy?"
"204987124-0-51797";"I took care of him. And his master, Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-51801";"You talk about the Order like you're not a part of it."
"204987124-0-51802";"So, who are you anyway?"
"204987124-0-51803";"Do you even know how it works?"
"204987124-0-51804";"Lotus didn't eat this, right?"
"204987124-0-51805";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-51806";"So, who are you anyway?"
"204987124-0-51807";"I place the gourd of water."
"204987124-0-51808";"I'll be fine."
"204987124-0-51814";"Is there anything more I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-51815";"Is she always so brusque?"
"204987124-0-51816";"Stand out?"
"204987124-0-51817";"A precaution against what?"
"204987124-0-51818";"But someone was able to break in, weren't they?"
"204987124-0-51819";"Do you know how the thief got in the vault?"
"204987124-0-51820";"Can you tell me more about your duties as Relicmaster?"
"204987124-0-51821";"Aren't you worried they might break in again?"
"204987124-0-51822";"Anyone you suspect?"
"204987124-0-51823";"I place the gourd of water."
"204987124-0-51827";"I place the gourd of water."
"204987124-0-51831";"What's wrong with speaking here?"
"204987124-0-51832";"Can't you use magic to summon the component you need?"
"204987124-0-51834";"All right. I'll meet you at the Daggerfall Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-51835";"What's wrong with speaking here?"
"204987124-0-51837";"All right. I'll meet you at the Davon's Watch Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-51838";"What's wrong with speaking here?"
"204987124-0-51840";"All right. I'll meet you at the Mages Guild in Vulkhel Guard."
"204987124-0-51841";"Is there anything else I can do?"
"204987124-0-51842";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-51843";"Tell me about the Sea Sload."
"204987124-0-51844";"It seems as though you're not very happy as Telenger's assistant."
"204987124-0-51845";"What's so interesting about Ebon Stadmont?"
"204987124-0-51847";"Soravil was a madman. This wasn't your fault."
"204987124-0-51849";"Where can I find this journal?"
"204987124-0-51853";"K'Garza is a necromancer while another Sea Sload to the south is working on a way to sink Summerset."
"204987124-0-51856";"Aren't you going to help me?"
"204987124-0-51857";"Librarium Kamlehal? What is that?"
"204987124-0-51860";"Aren't you going to help me?"
"204987124-0-51862";"And that will break the enchantment?"
"204987124-0-51863";"Why did you open the Illuminus in the first place?"
"204987124-0-51864";"All right. Who am I looking for?"
"204987124-0-51866";"You know what's going on here, don't you?"
"204987124-0-51870";"Darien … what are you doing?"
"204987124-0-51877";"I see. If he's Torchbug, who are you?"
"204987124-0-51879";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-51880";"Who is this Ghost of the Green?"
"204987124-0-51881";"Who is this Ghost of the Green?"
"204987124-0-51882";"Was the Dragon War when you slew Thurvokun?"
"204987124-0-51883";"I'm sure you did your ancestors proud. I'll raise a glass to your memory."
"204987124-0-51886";"Who is this Ghost of the Green you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-51887";"What do you mean, ""unique challenges?"""
"204987124-0-51888";"I'm no saint."
"204987124-0-51889";"Before you retired, did you make a habit of deputizing total strangers?"
"204987124-0-51890";"Really? You aren't scared of anything?"
"204987124-0-51892";"What do these contracts require?"
"204987124-0-51894";"How often can I complete contracts?"
"204987124-0-51895";"I've been to Artaeum and met Ritemaster Iachesis."
"204987124-0-51896";"And how would that interest these chaos-bringers?"
"204987124-0-51897";"What's the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-51898";"What's the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-51899";"Why won't you help me save the Oracle?"
"204987124-0-51900";"What kind of assignments can I expect?"
"204987124-0-51901";"Tell me more about the Divine Prosecution."
"204987124-0-51903";"Avanaire feared her sister would be killed."
"204987124-0-51909";"I scared some sense into Selynia. Maybe that affected the book."
"204987124-0-51910";"What do you suggest we do?"
"204987124-0-51912";"Her persona was brave to a fault. Scaring her with a spider broke the spell."
"204987124-0-51914";"I convinced him that a Daedric Prince freed him from a terrible curse."
"204987124-0-51916";"I encouraged her to doubt her instincts and second guess herself."
"204987124-0-51917";"How was the keep lost?"
"204987124-0-51920";"What happens to the Oracle now?"
"204987124-0-51921";"I thought Summerset was closed to outsiders."
"204987124-0-51922";"Every year? Why don't you retaliate?"
"204987124-0-51923";"That doesn't sound promising."
"204987124-0-51924";"Tell me about the Ritemaster."
"204987124-0-51925";"You seem a little uncomfortable with the Mages Guild's attention."
"204987124-0-51926";"Tell me about the Ritemaster."
"204987124-0-51927";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-51928";"Who are the Maormer and why did they attack you?"
"204987124-0-51930";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-51931";"What happens to the Oracle now?"
"204987124-0-51933";"Do you have any proof?"
"204987124-0-51934";"Were you in command of the keep before it fell into the hands of the Maormer?"
"204987124-0-51935";"If you were watching the Breton the whole time, isn't it possible that they're innocent?"
"204987124-0-51937";"Did you see anything else unusual before the pie went missing?"
"204987124-0-51938";"If you never saw the pirate leave, how can you be so sure?"
"204987124-0-51941";"Crumbs?"
"204987124-0-51944";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-51945";"Who are the Maormer and why did they attack you?"
"204987124-0-51947";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-51949";"Not really. I found this near an over-stuffed dog. <Show Tanelwen the half-eaten pie.>"
"204987124-0-51951";"You're Tanelwen. You were the victim of an enchantment. Erudil is in the courtyard waiting for you."
"204987124-0-51953";"What did Olnewil speak out about and where can I find her?"
"204987124-0-51956";"You're welcome. I'll accompany you."
"204987124-0-51957";"If I'm going to serve as your admanen, I need to know everything."
"204987124-0-51958";"So the Kinlady opposes the Queen's decree?"
"204987124-0-51959";"How does this Augur work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-51960";"What is your role here in the Psijic Order, Celarus?"
"204987124-0-51961";"Once I find the breach, I use these Psijic seals to close it?"
"204987124-0-51962";"How many libraries and archives do you have here?"
"204987124-0-51963";"Erudil's trying to set things right. He's in the courtyard now."
"204987124-0-51965";"I'm right behind you."
"204987124-0-51966";"So you're a teacher?"
"204987124-0-51967";"You think maintaining eight hundred sixty-three libraries is a modest pursuit?"
"204987124-0-51968";"Why are you looking for new members? I thought you were a reclusive group."
"204987124-0-51969";"Fair enough. So this map you mentioned will show me where the time breaches are located?"
"204987124-0-51970";"We'll see, I guess. Who's next?"
"204987124-0-51974";"Can you tell me this tale?"
"204987124-0-51976";"I'll find this story."
"204987124-0-51978";"How can we defeat him?"
"204987124-0-51980";"How did you become involved with Pandermalion?"
"204987124-0-51983";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-51984";"Here's some coin."
"204987124-0-51985";"What exactly should I be looking for in the Bosmer house?"
"204987124-0-51986";"Thank you, Loremaster. What's next?"
"204987124-0-51989";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-51990";"Very well. I will use my power to remove your gifts."
"204987124-0-51991";"I shall release you from my clutches."
"204987124-0-51992";"I am not Namira."
"204987124-0-51993";"Yes, of course."
"204987124-0-51997";"I'll let you get back to your work."
"204987124-0-51998";"You were under a powerful illusion enchantment. I'm helping Erudil find a way to reverse it."
"204987124-0-51999";"What else could be going on here?"
"204987124-0-52000";"He's in the center of the courtyard. I'll come with you."
"204987124-0-52001";"I don't know. I took the arrow that killed him as evidence. Maybe Lorne can learn something from it."
"204987124-0-52004";"He's in the center of the courtyard. I'll come with you."
"204987124-0-52005";"You got stranded together?"
"204987124-0-52007";"You keep calling me ""nebarra."" What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-52008";"I see. And is it common for High Elf monks to conspire with Daedra?"
"204987124-0-52009";"Like the High Elf monks I saw working with Daedra beneath the monastery?"
"204987124-0-52010";"An error in judgment?"
"204987124-0-52012";"What can you tell me about the Sea Mage we're after?"
"204987124-0-52013";"What saved you?"
"204987124-0-52014";"Sure, I'll take a look."
"204987124-0-52017";"Pandermalion changed that for you?"
"204987124-0-52021";"Wait. Don't move!"
"204987124-0-52022";"How did you become involved with Pandermalion?"
"204987124-0-52023";"Do you think we've changed the past already?"
"204987124-0-52027";"All right. I'm right behind you."
"204987124-0-52028";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-52029";"The Court of Bedlam killed all of Meridia's followers in Summerset?"
"204987124-0-52031";"I guess I could go search around to the north of Shimmerene."
"204987124-0-52038";"Tell me more about this war between the Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-52042";"There are only a few of you here. Where are the rest of the newcomers?"
"204987124-0-52044";"I'll unlock the cage then see what's going on in the next chamber."
"204987124-0-52045";"The book knows what I am doing?"
"204987124-0-52047";"Do all of the monks at the monastery worship Daedra?"
"204987124-0-52048";"That's where the prisoner said the monks took the rest of the newcomers."
"204987124-0-52049";"What about your missing friend?"
"204987124-0-52053";"What was that projection you were looking at?"
"204987124-0-52054";"That's how you remembered using the Dreaming Cave to hide the Heart?"
"204987124-0-52055";"Tell me more about the Dreaming Cave."
"204987124-0-52056";"Vivienne believes you're innocent. She says you would never kill anyone."
"204987124-0-52057";"And that barrier blocks access to the portal anyway, right?"
"204987124-0-52058";"Do you really think Leythen will help us?"
"204987124-0-52060";"I've decided to investigate Haladan's murder. You need to tell me what happened."
"204987124-0-52061";"Harm it in what way?"
"204987124-0-52063";"So now it's forbidden?"
"204987124-0-52064";"Where can I find Leythen?"
"204987124-0-52065";"What about the other Sea Sloads? Can't the Abyssal Cabal replace K'Tora's magic?"
"204987124-0-52066";"Why can't we use the Dreaming Cave to contact Meridia?"
"204987124-0-52067";"Remind me. What's the triad of Daedric Princes again?"
"204987124-0-52068";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-52069";"Why are you telling me this?"
"204987124-0-52070";"Tell me more about this war between the Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-52071";"What about your oath to Valsirenn?"
"204987124-0-52072";"Tarnamir said you two drifted apart after you caught the first Ghost of the Green."
"204987124-0-52073";"So what brought you back together?"
"204987124-0-52074";"Do you still think about what happened?"
"204987124-0-52075";"What exactly should I be looking for in the Bosmer house?"
"204987124-0-52076";"What happened to your daughter?"
"204987124-0-52080";"Tell me more about this war between the Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-52081";"The Ritemaster and Leythen are friends?"
"204987124-0-52083";"The Ritemaster wants me to talk to Leythen."
"204987124-0-52084";"Could it have been diseased?"
"204987124-0-52085";"We should keep looking."
"204987124-0-52088";"By another keeper?"
"204987124-0-52089";"So what do you propose we do with them?"
"204987124-0-52090";"What else can you tell me about Traitor's Vault?"
"204987124-0-52091";"All right. Once I'm in the Traitor's Vault, how do I seal away these books?"
"204987124-0-52092";"One Dark Elf? Is that significant?"
"204987124-0-52094";"Soravil."
"204987124-0-52095";"Do the Daedric Princes always work together?"
"204987124-0-52096";"Aren't you worried about the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-52100";"Are you familiar with the Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-0-52101";"Aren't you worried about the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-52102";"Aren't you worried about the Divine Prosecution?"
"204987124-0-52105";"So they're meant for some sort of ritual?"
"204987124-0-52106";"Do you know a way into the Conservatory?"
"204987124-0-52109";"What exactly are the cocoons I have to destroy?"
"204987124-0-52111";"How is he connected to the rose?"
"204987124-0-52112";"What sort of means?"
"204987124-0-52113";"What makes Sea Elf vipers so bad?"
"204987124-0-52114";"How did you make contact with a Psijic mage?"
"204987124-0-52115";"What do you mean, Darien changed?"
"204987124-0-52116";"That may be true, but there are other places in Tamriel where that history holds no weight."
"204987124-0-52117";"Safe journey to you."
"204987124-0-52118";"I have proof. I found this among the captor's belongings."
"204987124-0-52121";"I retrieved the Dawnstar gem. Can it be used to reforge Dawnbreaker?"
"204987124-0-52122";"The triad's attacking your realm?"
"204987124-0-52124";"If Emile confessed, why do you think he's innocent?"
"204987124-0-52125";"What's your relationship with Emile?"
"204987124-0-52126";"All right, I'll help you investigate. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-52127";"I'll go upstairs and speak to her."
"204987124-0-52128";"So you're the reason Manacar wasn't let in."
"204987124-0-52129";"What if they've already done something to her?"
"204987124-0-52133";"Why didn't you tell me you were a member of the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-52134";"You think he's hiding from you?"
"204987124-0-52135";"I met an oracle, one of the Wyresses of Glenumbra. She seemed to have a connection with Artaeum."
"204987124-0-52136";"And what about that missing friend that you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-52137";"Why didn't you tell me you were a member of the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-52140";"What sort of danger?"
"204987124-0-52141";"So Summerset citizens aren't allowed to read about Daedric worship?"
"204987124-0-52142";"And why do you need me to destroy the cult's texts?"
"204987124-0-52143";"Right. Can you tell me more about the cocoons I have to destory?"
"204987124-0-52145";"And then?"
"204987124-0-52146";"You seem to enjoy the wine here well enough."
"204987124-0-52147";"You're the only one."
"204987124-0-52149";"I retrieved the Dawnstar gem when you dropped it. It led me right to you."
"204987124-0-52150";"Stay close. I'll get you out of here."
"204987124-0-52151";"Stay close. I'll get you out of here."
"204987124-0-52152";"Stay close. I'll get you out of here."
"204987124-0-52156";"And why are they in Tor-Hame-Khard?"
"204987124-0-52158";"Where exactly?"
"204987124-0-52161";"Why are Haeliata and Nagravia so different from other gryphons?"
"204987124-0-52162";"And all three roles are required?"
"204987124-0-52163";"Sounds like a solid plan."
"204987124-0-52164";"So Sunhold has a … pet gryphon?"
"204987124-0-52165";"Why do High Elves distrust the number two?"
"204987124-0-52166";"How is it the number of Man?"
"204987124-0-52168";"Do you believe that?"
"204987124-0-52173";"Is the whole city captured?"
"204987124-0-52174";"Why does Viscarne want you dead in particular?"
"204987124-0-52176";"Sacred?"
"204987124-0-52177";"If gryphons can be so deadly, why are they also revered?"
"204987124-0-52178";"Why do they want to eat mer?"
"204987124-0-52179";"Why don't you just leave her behind then?"
"204987124-0-52180";"If gryphons can live peacefully in Summerset, what's so different about Haeliata and Nagravia?"
"204987124-0-52181";"Why Sunhold?"
"204987124-0-52182";"You think there's still a chance they could resist?"
"204987124-0-52186";"I'll make sure to follow Cur."
"204987124-0-52188";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-52189";"But he's a hulkynd. Associating with him could ruin your career."
"204987124-0-52191";"She's an artist named Tableau."
"204987124-0-52193";"How did Tableau feel about that?"
"204987124-0-52195";"It sounds like you still care for her."
"204987124-0-52196";"So, the Blackbirds were never real?"
"204987124-0-52198";"Manacar wants you to go back to Lilawen and become the famous artist he knows you can be."
"204987124-0-52200";"Maybe there was some sort of falling out between your ancestors."
"204987124-0-52202";"How can she help us fight against the Maormer?"
"204987124-0-52203";"How did the Maormer invade Sunhold?"
"204987124-0-52204";"Tell me more about Sunnawel."
"204987124-0-52205";"But you think the Maormer are lying."
"204987124-0-52206";"Tell me more about Sunnawel."
"204987124-0-52207";"The Ritemaster heard these words, but we can't translate them. They may point to the tower crystal."
"204987124-0-52210";"I can go to Ebon Stadmont. What do you need to complete the translation?"
"204987124-0-52212";"Thrassian Plague?"
"204987124-0-52213";"Could the plague have originated here?"
"204987124-0-52215";"How did you end up protecting Kinlady Helenaere?"
"204987124-0-52216";"What brought you to Summerset?"
"204987124-0-52217";"How did you end up protecting Kinlady Helenaere?"
"204987124-0-52218";"You said you heard something?"
"204987124-0-52219";"I'll go first."
"204987124-0-52221";"I can handle Arillas, the Saviors, and whoever else comes to stop us. Just keep your head down."
"204987124-0-52223";"What kind of sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-52224";"You're going to kill him."
"204987124-0-52225";"What do you mean they'll have a place in Corgrad?"
"204987124-0-52226";"What's wrong with Arillas and the others who serve you?"
"204987124-0-52227";"You hope not?"
"204987124-0-52229";"But you're not giving Faidur that same choice."
"204987124-0-52231";"Stay close."
"204987124-0-52235";"Your curse? The fact that you're a hulkynd?"
"204987124-0-52236";"They exploited a secret entrance only he could open. He was using it to carry on an illicit affair."
"204987124-0-52237";"Why do you think Leythen joined forces with Mephala?"
"204987124-0-52238";"The Psijic Order couldn't save her?"
"204987124-0-52239";"Shouldn't Valsirenn ask Leythen for this favor?"
"204987124-0-52241";"Do you really expect Leythen to help us?"
"204987124-0-52243";"What happened to you and Val was horrible. I'm just trying to help."
"204987124-0-52245";"So why do you hate each other?"
"204987124-0-52246";"What does the rune you gave me do exactly?"
"204987124-0-52247";"What does the rune you gave me do exactly?"
"204987124-0-52248";"What can I expect to find in Ebon Stadmont?"
"204987124-0-52249";"What's going on between you and Valsirenn?"
"204987124-0-52252";"Do you think anyone else is in danger?"
"204987124-0-52254";"What do they do?"
"204987124-0-52261";"Do you truly hate him so much?"
"204987124-0-52262";"Thank you? What does a Professor of Applied Phrenology do exactly?"
"204987124-0-52265";"How do I find this massive stone covered in the ancient writing?"
"204987124-0-52267";"I'll find the stone."
"204987124-0-52268";"All right, see if you can establish a rapport. I'll be back soon."
"204987124-0-52270";"Tell me about your father."
"204987124-0-52271";"Is the island dangerous?"
"204987124-0-52272";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-52273";"Did your father save you?"
"204987124-0-52274";"Is the island dangerous?"
"204987124-0-52278";"Why doesn't Nocturnal retrieve the Heart herself?"
"204987124-0-52280";"You mentioned someone named Leythen when you were talking to the Ritemaster earlier."
"204987124-0-52282";"Do you think something happened to him?"
"204987124-0-52283";"How long have you known the Ritemaster?"
"204987124-0-52284";"You mentioned someone named Leythen when you were talking to the Ritemaster earlier."
"204987124-0-52285";"Does the Ritemaster ever leave Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-52289";"Nocturnal's earl also indicated that you've been informing the Court about our plans."
"204987124-0-52292";"I'll return to Artaeum as soon as I can."
"204987124-0-52294";"What does the triad of Daedric Princes hope to achieve?"
"204987124-0-52295";"What am I supposed to tell your daughter if you get yourself killed?"
"204987124-0-52297";"How many people made up your fleet?"
"204987124-0-52299";"And what does the Court of Bedlam get out of all this?"
"204987124-0-52300";"You're certain none of them could have escaped?"
"204987124-0-52301";"How did you get involved in all this?"
"204987124-0-52303";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-52304";"All right, I'm in."
"204987124-0-52305";"But you're not a High Elf like the other members of the Court of Bedlam."
"204987124-0-52307";"You stole a book from a place called ""The Library of Shrieking Terror?"""
"204987124-0-52308";"If this is a school, where are the professors?"
"204987124-0-52310";"Have you tried talking to him?"
"204987124-0-52311";"If it took hold of your professors, why weren't you affected?"
"204987124-0-52312";"What does the triad of Daedric Princes hope to achieve?"
"204987124-0-52313";"Maybe you have a quality you're not aware of."
"204987124-0-52314";"Can you tell me a little about this place?"
"204987124-0-52315";"Can you tell me a little about this place?"
"204987124-0-52316";"I doubt it."
"204987124-0-52317";"So you're librarians?"
"204987124-0-52318";"You can do it."
"204987124-0-52319";"Lirendel Rumilong von Cilibanwe …"
"204987124-0-52320";"Do you think the sinkhole might be connected to the Daedric plot?"
"204987124-0-52322";"What do you focus on?"
"204987124-0-52323";"If this is a school, where are the professors?"
"204987124-0-52324";"Boring?"
"204987124-0-52328";"Do you have any children?"
"204987124-0-52330";"I'll go and talk to Darien."
"204987124-0-52332";"But what if this is all just an elaborate trap to get you to reveal the hiding place?"
"204987124-0-52334";"Do you remember anything else related to this supposed spell?"
"204987124-0-52337";"So what do the words you translated mean?"
"204987124-0-52345";"Not that I can recall. The first time I saw you was when you were wearing your golden armor."
"204987124-0-52346";"When were you in Meridia's realm?"
"204987124-0-52347";"So you didn't die?"
"204987124-0-52348";"So how do we stop the Daedric Princes?"
"204987124-0-52349";"What kind of help do you require?"
"204987124-0-52350";"All right, I'll gather a few of these spell particles."
"204987124-0-52352";"To what end?"
"204987124-0-52354";"Are you a member of the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-52355";"Where did all these books come from?"
"204987124-0-52356";"Why aren't you more concerned about this mind trap?"
"204987124-0-52357";"Let's go get the Heart back."
"204987124-0-52358";"I won't let you continue these experiments."
"204987124-0-52360";"You suspect he's trying to scare you off?"
"204987124-0-52361";"Why did you come here to begin with?"
"204987124-0-52362";"You're at odds with Faidur?"
"204987124-0-52363";"Why did you come here to begin with?"
"204987124-0-52364";"Oriandra, we're ready to get out of here."
"204987124-0-52367";"What do you mean, too far?"
"204987124-0-52368";"Eldhon, where's Nedoril now? Eldhon?"
"204987124-0-52369";"You said Meridia gave you a mission?"
"204987124-0-52371";"Let's go get the Heart back."
"204987124-0-52372";"I'll try."
"204987124-0-52373";"I promised Talomar I'd help him keep Lotus safe and I intend to keep it."
"204987124-0-52374";"Do people often take issue with your methods?"
"204987124-0-52376";"How do you know this Wood Elf, Eslion, is responsible?"
"204987124-0-52377";"What was the issue Eslion had with your work again?"
"204987124-0-52378";"Have you spoken to the authorities?"
"204987124-0-52379";"Why would the vandal target you specifically?"
"204987124-0-52380";"What sort of proof am I looking for?"
"204987124-0-52381";"Why would the vandal target you specifically?"
"204987124-0-52383";"I want to take a look around as well."
"204987124-0-52384";"Can you tell me more about Nubani?"
"204987124-0-52385";"Strange fighters?"
"204987124-0-52386";"Your family doesn't seem terribly interested in this land."
"204987124-0-52387";"You think they're hiding something?"
"204987124-0-52388";"The outcasts claim you're trying to run them off the land. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-52389";"The outcasts claim you're trying to run them off the land. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-52390";"I'm told you were the one who's been planting these stranglers."
"204987124-0-52391";"If that's true, why haven't you killed off the stranglers?"
"204987124-0-52393";"I could spread the poison for you."
"204987124-0-52394";"And that's why you planted new seeds in Vinafwe's arrangements? To make them beautiful?"
"204987124-0-52395";"What brought you to Summerset?"
"204987124-0-52396";"She thought you were trying to kill her."
"204987124-0-52397";"Summerset feels fake?"
"204987124-0-52398";"It's their land. This is how they want it."
"204987124-0-52399";"I couldn't say."
"204987124-0-52401";"What are you looking for down here?"
"204987124-0-52402";"All right. I'll dump the shipments into the sea."
"204987124-0-52403";"So your only option was to smuggle goods?"
"204987124-0-52404";"We'll need to approach cautiously. Be on your guard."
"204987124-0-52407";"So you don't trade dangerous items?"
"204987124-0-52408";"That's the one. Better not keep him waiting."
"204987124-0-52409";"Stay safe."
"204987124-0-52411";"Did the monks offer any explanation as to where she was or when she'd be returned?"
"204987124-0-52412";"People above have gone missing. Some found their way down here."
"204987124-0-52413";"So your only option was to smuggle goods?"
"204987124-0-52415";"So you don't trade dangerous items?"
"204987124-0-52416";"You did intend to tamper with Vinafwe's botanical arrangements though."
"204987124-0-52417";"I'll hold you to that."
"204987124-0-52419";"Be more cautious in the future."
"204987124-0-52421";"I'll consider your words."
"204987124-0-52423";"Focus on that, Miriya, and you can break out of this mind trap."
"204987124-0-52425";"Oriandra, we're ready to get out of here."
"204987124-0-52426";"What was the Saviors' sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-52428";"How do you survive down here?"
"204987124-0-52430";"The act?"
"204987124-0-52431";"What happens if the Crystal Tower is amplified?"
"204987124-0-52432";"If I can ever repay you for your help, let me know."
"204987124-0-52434";"What does that mean, you departed the world?"
"204987124-0-52435";"<Enter Fang Lair.>"
"204987124-0-52437";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-52439";"Why is the Heart so special?"
"204987124-0-52440";"How can the Crystal Tower exist on multiple planes at the same time?"
"204987124-0-52442";"I need to stop Andewen from going to the past."
"204987124-0-52443";"Back to the start. Does that mean I'm in the present?"
"204987124-0-52445";"You serve a greater force? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-52446";"Her plans?"
"204987124-0-52448";"So I'm ready to be certified?"
"204987124-0-52450";"I already have enough pewter dust."
"204987124-0-52451";"I'll go craft the ring."
"204987124-0-52453";"Actually, I already have some pewter ounces. What should I do with them?"
"204987124-0-52455";"I'll return with the dust."
"204987124-0-52457";"<Enter Scalecaller Peak.>"
"204987124-0-52459";"Fool's gold island?"
"204987124-0-52460";"Actually, I have pewter ounces. What's next?"
"204987124-0-52461";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-52462";"Don't worry. Ruliel sent me to look for you."
"204987124-0-52464";"How did you happen to get past the sentry, by the way?"
"204987124-0-52466";"I'm working with Razum-dar, one of the Queen's Eyes. But what happened to the pearl?"
"204987124-0-52467";"Tell me about the Divine Prosecution."
"204987124-0-52468";"What about Lotus and Talomar?"
"204987124-0-52470";"So Andewen was trapped in Ebon Stadmont to study the language?"
"204987124-0-52471";"Your mistress?"
"204987124-0-52472";"Continued the loop? I'm not sure what you mean."
"204987124-0-52473";"And were you aware that the Aldarch's monks are killing the newcomers under the monastery?"
"204987124-0-52475";"I won't let you do this to him."
"204987124-0-52476";"What was what?"
"204987124-0-52477";"What did the spirit learn enough about?"
"204987124-0-52478";"You've never tasted beer before?"
"204987124-0-52480";"The Thrassian Plague. I'm told it claimed many lives."
"204987124-0-52481";"You don't mean they're still infected?"
"204987124-0-52482";"You drowned your own people?"
"204987124-0-52483";"What can you tell me about Traitor's Vault?"
"204987124-0-52484";"Why hasn't the Psijic Order cleaned it out?"
"204987124-0-52485";"Fair enough. What are you drinking?"
"204987124-0-52486";"What have you become?"
"204987124-0-52487";"Because Faidur isn't infected?"
"204987124-0-52488";"Why do Arillas and the others call you their Saviors?"
"204987124-0-52489";"Why do Arillas and the others call you their Saviors?"
"204987124-0-52490";"What made it so bad?"
"204987124-0-52491";"Before I leave, can you tell me about your life as an artist?"
"204987124-0-52493";"Is there a way to buy dust instead?"
"204987124-0-52494";"Are there other ways to get pewter dust?"
"204987124-0-52495";"Why would I deconstruct something?"
"204987124-0-52496";"What is deconstruction?"
"204987124-0-52497";"So why would I deconstruct something?"
"204987124-0-52498";"What right do you have to kidnap and experiment on people?"
"204987124-0-52499";"What's wrong with Arillas and the others who serve you?"
"204987124-0-52503";"It won't be safe here, not yet. You should take your people elsewhere for now."
"204987124-0-52504";"Who or what is K'Tora?"
"204987124-0-52507";"What's the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-52508";"If I can ever repay you for your help, let me know."
"204987124-0-52509";"Are you recovering?"
"204987124-0-52510";"Will you tell anyone what you found here?"
"204987124-0-52511";"Will you tell anyone what you found here?"
"204987124-0-52513";"First, tell me the triad's original plan."
"204987124-0-52514";"What brings you to Summerset?"
"204987124-0-52515";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-52520";"And your companions?"
"204987124-0-52521";"Any ideas on how I should deal with these illusions?"
"204987124-0-52524";"What was the Golden Knight that appeared in the scrying pool vision?"
"204987124-0-52525";"Fine."
"204987124-0-52526";"Culanarin Salolinwe 'ata Piryaden-Itelnoril …"
"204987124-0-52527";"Lirendel Rumilong von Cilibanwe …"
"204987124-0-52528";"Hally'frally Fulinil 'coo Torlywol-Nibiliwe?"
"204987124-0-52529";"Fine."
"204987124-0-52530";"Culanarin Salolinwe 'ata Piryaden-Itelnoril …"
"204987124-0-52531";"Really?"
"204987124-0-52532";"Hally'frally Fulinil 'coo Torlywol-Nibiliwe?"
"204987124-0-52533";"Yes. Let's get this fight started."
"204987124-0-52535";"What kind of traits can I research?"
"204987124-0-52536";"What are you hunting?"
"204987124-0-52537";"Is there anything else I should know about jewelry traits?"
"204987124-0-52538";"What kind of traits can I research?"
"204987124-0-52539";"And you've quit being Telenger's assistant?"
"204987124-0-52540";"I see. Do you know why I hear a woman's voice reading these inscriptions?"
"204987124-0-52541";"If I take you out of that box, will you help me find these time breaches?"
"204987124-0-52542";"What's the condition?"
"204987124-0-52544";"I'll discuss it with Loremaster Celarus. No promises."
"204987124-0-52545";"Do you have it?"
"204987124-0-52546";"All right. I'll go to Wasten Coraldale and recover it."
"204987124-0-52547";"Do you have any idea where the Augur went?"
"204987124-0-52548";"All right. How will I know where the books go?"
"204987124-0-52549";"So you're a breeder?"
"204987124-0-52550";"These creatures serve the Sea Sload."
"204987124-0-52553";"Trust me. The Sea Sload are in Summerset."
"204987124-0-52581";"If the yaghra are attacking by the beach, how did the pearl get down there?"
"204987124-0-52583";"I'll help you destroy the pearl."
"204987124-0-52584";"Where's the rest of your companions?"
"204987124-0-52586";"And my reward?"
"204987124-0-52587";"<Enter <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-52588";"Your father is trapped here?"
"204987124-0-52590";"And as for my reward?"
"204987124-0-52591";"<Enter March of Sacrifices.>"
"204987124-0-52593";"I can help you take down this werewolf pack."
"204987124-0-52599";"I can help you hunt down this indrik."
"204987124-0-52604";"It seems like you're bullying your assistants."
"204987124-0-52606";"If I offered some funds, would you work them less?"
"204987124-0-52609";"You shouldn't have to put up with that."
"204987124-0-52610";"There's a small sailboat in the cove beyond the caves that we can use to escape."
"204987124-0-52613";"What about the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-52615";"But you're willing to ask a newcomer for help?"
"204987124-0-52616";"What's a justiciar?"
"204987124-0-52617";"Tell me about Madja's mutiny."
"204987124-0-52618";"If you're not so interested in hunting, why not drink with them?"
"204987124-0-52619";"If you're not so interested in hunting, why not drink with them?"
"204987124-0-52620";"If you're not so interested in hunting, why not drink with them?"
"204987124-0-52621";"If you're not so interested in hunting, why not drink with them?"
"204987124-0-52622";"Why did you choose Karnwasten to be your port in the first place?"
"204987124-0-52627";"Do you have any tips for fighting indriks?"
"204987124-0-52628";"Have you gone looking for it?"
"204987124-0-52630";"Be the cooler head. If you do as she asks you can put this whole affair behind you."
"204987124-0-52631";"Be the cooler head. If you do as she asks you can put this whole affair behind you."
"204987124-0-52632";"Be the cooler head. If you do as she asks you can put this whole affair behind you."
"204987124-0-52633";"Have you looked for it?"
"204987124-0-52634";"Isn't that a bit much?"
"204987124-0-52635";"Isn't that a bit much?"
"204987124-0-52636";"Isn't that a bit much?"
"204987124-0-52639";"Why would you need to keep that from your troops?"
"204987124-0-52640";"I'll destroy the abyssal pearls."
"204987124-0-52649";"K'Tora used abyssal pearls to summon yaghra to attack Rellenthil."
"204987124-0-52650";"Why would the Daedric Princes require the aid of the Sea Sloads?"
"204987124-0-52651";"What are the Welkynars?"
"204987124-0-52652";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-52656";"Tell me about her powers."
"204987124-0-52657";"So you're the ones who brought Z'Maja into Cloudrest?"
"204987124-0-52658";"I thought gryphons were wild animals."
"204987124-0-52659";"How are your companions?"
"204987124-0-52660";"How was Z'Maja able to use this magic?"
"204987124-0-52661";"How was Z'Maja able to use this magic?"
"204987124-0-52662";"What are you doing in Shimmerene?"
"204987124-0-52663";"Do you gather the eggs yourself?"
"204987124-0-52664";"Do you think you'll be able to secure funding?"
"204987124-0-52665";"Tell me more about Z'Maja."
"204987124-0-52667";"Tell me about the Welkynars."
"204987124-0-52668";"What are the Welkynars?"
"204987124-0-52672";"Tell me more about the Welkynars."
"204987124-0-52673";"How can I defeat their shadow replicas?"
"204987124-0-52676";"What do you know of Z'Maja?"
"204987124-0-52678";"Why do they call you sober then?"
"204987124-0-52679";"How so?"
"204987124-0-52680";"All right. Now, can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-0-52681";"Do you think the murderer will strike again?"
"204987124-0-52682";"Why are you called Igeke Rat-Bite?"
"204987124-0-52683";"Is that how she got the treasure?"
"204987124-0-52684";"All right then. Tell me about Gjadil the Keel-Hauler."
"204987124-0-52685";"And she enchanted it so that only her descendants could open it."
"204987124-0-52686";"Let's change topics. Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-52687";"So, you're a performer?"
"204987124-0-52688";"Is the treasure that great?"
"204987124-0-52689";"What can you tell me about Vareda's death?"
"204987124-0-52690";"But you suspect the others got greedy."
"204987124-0-52691";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-52692";"Us newcomers have to stick together."
"204987124-0-52696";"What makes Sea Elf vipers so bad?"
"204987124-0-52697";"Why don't you think I'll encounter Sea Elf vipers?"
"204987124-0-52698";"Who are you and why are you trying to save these adventurers?"
"204987124-0-52699";"An ancient order of sages and magic users?"
"204987124-0-52700";"What will I encounter in the mindscape?"
"204987124-0-52701";"Tell me about the spell you're performing."
"204987124-0-52702";"What happens when I find Cainar and the others?"
"204987124-0-52703";"What's the purpose of the mind trap?"
"204987124-0-52704";"Who are you and why are you trying to save these adventurers?"
"204987124-0-52705";"And the pilgrims' articles of faith are meant for some kind of ritual?"
"204987124-0-52706";"Is it common for pilgrims to die like this?"
"204987124-0-52708";"What's the punishment?"
"204987124-0-52709";"Why not show her some mercy then? I'm sure you have more important matters to resolve."
"204987124-0-52710";"I can do that. Good luck to you both."
"204987124-0-52711";"Very well."
"204987124-0-52712";"What is this curse of Corgrad the Sapiarchs are concerned about?"
"204987124-0-52716";"I can pay for you."
"204987124-0-52717";"So you stole some chickens."
"204987124-0-52718";"What's interesting about that?"
"204987124-0-52722";"Any advice on how I should deal with the Queen of the Reef?"
"204987124-0-52723";"What do crab eggs have to do with a spreading curse?"
"204987124-0-52724";"Any advice on how I should deal with the Queen of the Reef?"
"204987124-0-52725";"When's the last time you saw wild chickens? She knew she was stealing."
"204987124-0-52727";"What is this creature, Graveld, that I'm hunting?"
"204987124-0-52728";"Why do you want these Scrolls of Oath?"
"204987124-0-52729";"Why do you want these Scrolls of Oath?"
"204987124-0-52730";"What's the Royal Menagerie?"
"204987124-0-52731";"Who are you and why are you trying to save these adventurers?"
"204987124-0-52735";"Well, you are making a scene."
"204987124-0-52736";"Is that a crime?"
"204987124-0-52738";"You know what? I've got you covered."
"204987124-0-52739";"Why's that important?"
"204987124-0-52741";"That's all pretty circumstantial."
"204987124-0-52744";"You're turning up around this kinlord a lot."
"204987124-0-52745";"Designs on Kinlord Valenbar?"
"204987124-0-52746";"I suppose I believe you."
"204987124-0-52752";"Do you have any hard evidence?"
"204987124-0-52757";"I think you're trying to make a connection where there isn't one. Stop harassing her."
"204987124-0-52758";"You mean Kinlord Valenbar's disappearance?"
"204987124-0-52759";"Can you prove that?"
"204987124-0-52760";"Did you have anything to do with it?"
"204987124-0-52761";"Did you have anything to do with it?"
"204987124-0-52766";"This is way over your head. Trust your superiors."
"204987124-0-52770";"Speaking of bottles, you must have some idea where they could be."
"204987124-0-52771";"What sort of complication?"
"204987124-0-52772";"So you're pleased he's dead."
"204987124-0-52773";"How does that help Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-52774";"That sounds rather cold."
"204987124-0-52777";"Nocturnal's no longer working with the other Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-52778";"An ephem? What's that?"
"204987124-0-52779";"I'll deliver the indrik heart."
"204987124-0-52780";"Where do I have to travel to?"
"204987124-0-52781";"All right. Just so you know, Manacar couldn't deliver the heart because he had another obligation."
"204987124-0-52782";"Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-0-52784";"So you think she'll use the Heart to take control of the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-52786";"How were the Princes planning to enter the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-52788";"So without the Sapiarchs' keys, Nocturnal can't enter the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-52789";"I'm sure he'll open up in his own time."
"204987124-0-52791";"Why would Nocturnal betray the triad and take the Heart?"
"204987124-0-52792";"Will the ritual work?"
"204987124-0-52794";"He told me he was a Marine in the Queen's Navy."
"204987124-0-52795";"Good luck to you."
"204987124-0-52797";"I think you should tell him that. It's not my place to say."
"204987124-0-52798";"Good luck to you."
"204987124-0-52799";"Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-0-52800";"What does Clavicus Vile want to talk about?"
"204987124-0-52802";"So how do I talk to Clavicus Vile?"
"204987124-0-52803";"I'll go to the caves and talk to Clavicus Vile."
"204987124-0-52808";"How did you get off Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-52809";"How did Nocturnal breach the Crystal Tower without the Resolute Diamonds?"
"204987124-0-52810";"How did you get off Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-52811";"How did you get off Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-52815";"Is there anything I can do to help restore your missing memories?"
"204987124-0-52816";"So K'Tora has been controlling your actions for all these years?"
"204987124-0-52818";"Where did you send Valsirenn and Oriandra?"
"204987124-0-52819";"How do the Sapiarchs decide on apprentices?"
"204987124-0-52820";"Sounds tough."
"204987124-0-52823";"And these aprax Elves do a lot of writing?"
"204987124-0-52825";"Are there any aprax Elves here in Shimmerene?"
"204987124-0-52826";"The vaulted halsoriel?"
"204987124-0-52827";"Why do you think that upsets your ancestors?"
"204987124-0-52829";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-52830";"This must be a little embarassing."
"204987124-0-52831";"Just one more thing—do you have any idea what happened to Arathel?"
"204987124-0-52832";"Arathel's mother thinks he's innocent of the charges. What will happen to him if I bring him back?"
"204987124-0-52833";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-52838";"How do you think she'll feel about it?"
"204987124-0-52839";"So she's accepted that you're now part of the House of Reveries?"
"204987124-0-52840";"Was it difficult to start a new life?"
"204987124-0-52852";"Why do you think that is?"
"204987124-0-52853";"It seems you've met many who share your experience."
"204987124-0-52854";"Have many in the House of Reveries changed their gender?"
"204987124-0-52864";"Do you ever miss being a mage?"
"204987124-0-52865";"How do we get to the Sapiarchs' compound?"
"204987124-0-52866";"How do we get to the Sapiarchs' compound?"
"204987124-0-52867";"How do we get to the Sapiarchs' compound?"
"204987124-0-52868";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-52870";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-52871";"Isn't that what Nocturnal still wants to do?"
"204987124-0-52873";"It's that serious?"
"204987124-0-52874";"Even if the stranglers were an accident, why were you vandalizing Vinafwe's work in the first place?"
"204987124-0-52875";"But me poisoning the stranglers is fine?"
"204987124-0-52876";"Even if the stranglers were an accident, why were you vandalizing Vinafwe's work in the first place?"
"204987124-0-52878";"What was her role in all this?"
"204987124-0-52879";"What does having a family have to do with who you can trust?"
"204987124-0-52880";"Speaking of honor … are you really going to eat an indrik heart?"
"204987124-0-52881";"Speaking of honor … are you really going to eat an indrik heart?"
"204987124-0-52883";"Why are you even looking for Arathel?"
"204987124-0-52886";"I'll testify on your behalf. [Eslion Goes Free]"
"204987124-0-52888";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-52889";"A rat did that?"
"204987124-0-52890";"I just want to know a little more about the person I'm working with."
"204987124-0-52891";"Can you tell me more about your cousins?"
"204987124-0-52892";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-52893";"That's all?"
"204987124-0-52894";"How well do you know Arathel?"
"204987124-0-52895";"Why did you do it?"
"204987124-0-52896";"Do you think he'd be capable of killing a Sapiarch?"
"204987124-0-52897";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-52898";"Do you think Mirulon gave him a good enough reason?"
"204987124-0-52899";"Do you know why he'd want the Sapiarch dead?"
"204987124-0-52900";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-52901";"Do you believe in all that?"
"204987124-0-52902";"Have you written to your sister Rinyde?"
"204987124-0-52903";"It was quite the twist."
"204987124-0-52905";"Do you regret killing Vareda?"
"204987124-0-52907";"Urlsar's not the one who's important here."
"204987124-0-52908";"You could just join a pirate crew."
"204987124-0-52910";"Tell her that."
"204987124-0-52914";"Is there a way to do that?"
"204987124-0-52917";"Unpredictable how?"
"204987124-0-52918";"We'll just have to risk it."
"204987124-0-52921";"So you wear masks to show devotion to your art."
"204987124-0-52925";"Take care, Firebird."
"204987124-0-52926";"Good luck with your audition, Clever."
"204987124-0-52927";"You were a mage?"
"204987124-0-52928";"Do you ever miss being a mage?"
"204987124-0-52929";"Tell me about joining the House of Reveries."
"204987124-0-52930";"Tell me about joining the House of Reveries."
"204987124-0-52931";"So you hunt monsters?"
"204987124-0-52934";"Why won't the guards let you inside the keep?"
"204987124-0-52935";"Just let me know when you need me."
"204987124-0-52936";"Learn what?"
"204987124-0-52938";"I'll lead."
"204987124-0-52939";"I'll enter the mindscape."
"204987124-0-52940";"Can you tell me a little more about what happened here?"
"204987124-0-52941";"What were you and your friend talking about before I arrived?"
"204987124-0-52942";"Can you tell me a little more about what happened here?"
"204987124-0-52943";"Do you know why the Daedra attacked the college?"
"204987124-0-52945";"Why did the Daedric cultist kill Grenedel?"
"204987124-0-52946";"Get her to safety? What do you think is about to happen?"
"204987124-0-52947";"What did you mean when you said that Mirulon aims to bend Arathel's mind?"
"204987124-0-52948";"Dark reflections?"
"204987124-0-52949";"So what do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-52956";"So the Heart is part of a larger crystal?"
"204987124-0-52957";"He might be more sociable if you stop teasing him."
"204987124-0-52959";"So we need to find the books Hannayel mentioned?"
"204987124-0-52960";"A cultist led a Daedric assault on the College of Sapiarchs. That's where I was before coming here."
"204987124-0-52963";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-52964";"What do you know of Z'Maja?"
"204987124-0-52965";"Is there anything I can do to help with the investigation?"
"204987124-0-52966";"What's your history with the Divine Prosecution, and these two?"
"204987124-0-52967";"What about Hyircil?"
"204987124-0-52968";"Is there anything I can do to help with the investigation?"
"204987124-0-52969";"Do you think you'll go back?"
"204987124-0-52970";"How so?"
"204987124-0-52971";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-52972";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-52973";"I place the ""Sages of the Crystal Tower."""
"204987124-0-52974";"Are all your cases like this?"
"204987124-0-52975";"Don't wait too long."
"204987124-0-52984";"I place ""The Maormer of Pyandonea."""
"204987124-0-52985";"I place ""Further Notes on the Sload."""
"204987124-0-52986";"I place ""Sages of the Crystal Tower."""
"204987124-0-53000";"You mentioned foreign magic before. What did that have to do with believing Silurie?"
"204987124-0-53001";"You mentioned foreign magic before. What did that have to do with believing Silurie?"
"204987124-0-53002";"You mentioned foreign magic before. What did that have to do with believing Silurie?"
"204987124-0-53003";"Right. This ""court"" and their benefactor are still out there. Just remember Teraniel was an Altmer."
"204987124-0-53004";"You mentioned foreign magic before. What did that have to do with believing Silurie?"
"204987124-0-53005";"I'd like to talk to you about your investigation."
"204987124-0-53006";"And now?"
"204987124-0-53007";"What about the altar? Couldn't someone else use it?"
"204987124-0-53008";"Why were you so mistrustful of Silurie? If you accepted her help earlier it could have saved lives."
"204987124-0-53009";"Do you know what they want?"
"204987124-0-53010";"Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-0-53011";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-53012";"What's your next move?"
"204987124-0-53013";"Teraniel wasn't working alone. Any idea who is behind all this?"
"204987124-0-53014";"Why were you so mistrustful of Silurie? If you accepted her help earlier it could have saved lives."
"204987124-0-53015";"No, but I did have some other things to discuss."
"204987124-0-53016";"I believe the man who sent her here was Aldarch Tilcalar. He's dead now, but there are others."
"204987124-0-53017";"I'm working with the Psijics to stop them."
"204987124-0-53018";"No, but I believe the man who sent her here was Aldarch Tilcalar. He's dead now."
"204987124-0-53019";"That might be best. I did still have some things to discuss though."
"204987124-0-53020";"Before you go, I did have a few other things to discuss."
"204987124-0-53021";"Why were you so mistrustful of Silurie? If you accepted her help earlier it could have saved lives."
"204987124-0-53033";"What lessons are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-53034";"So you're more troubled by this happening in your homeland?"
"204987124-0-53035";"You haven't done that?"
"204987124-0-53040";"And you think that's what's stirring up these time breaches?"
"204987124-0-53042";"You're not concerned about it?"
"204987124-0-53043";"Why is the Staff of Towers so frightening?"
"204987124-0-53045";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-53046";"He's right about what?"
"204987124-0-53047";"Yes. A powerful artifact like that should be put to good use."
"204987124-0-53048";"He said he was proud of you. He just thinks the staff is too dangerous to wield."
"204987124-0-53049";"Where are the four remaining fragments?"
"204987124-0-53051";"So I need to place more Psijic Seals to discover the remaining fragments?"
"204987124-0-53055";"How so?"
"204987124-0-53056";"There's nothing wrong with finding love when everyone else wants you to hate."
"204987124-0-53059";"He said you suffered a trauma that might cloud your judgment."
"204987124-0-53060";"So he made a bad deal?"
"204987124-0-53062";"It's all right."
"204987124-0-53064";"You're welcome. What's next?"
"204987124-0-53065";"Not Castire."
"204987124-0-53066";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-53068";"Do you have any idea why?"
"204987124-0-53072";"Wait, I thought Loremaster Celarus was sealing the fragments away."
"204987124-0-53074";"You think you'll find a way to keep the pieces apart?"
"204987124-0-53075";"You don't trust Josajeh with the staff?"
"204987124-0-53077";"Something to do with her family woes?"
"204987124-0-53078";"So you let the Maormer into Sea Keep."
"204987124-0-53080";"Do you think you'll be able to store the staff safely?"
"204987124-0-53082";"That's good to hear. What's next?"
"204987124-0-53083";"Are you prepared to let this go when the time comes?"
"204987124-0-53085";"All right. I will see you when I return."
"204987124-0-53086";"And now?"
"204987124-0-53088";"How did she take the news?"
"204987124-0-53089";"You'd have used the staff, despite the Loremaster's warnings?"
"204987124-0-53091";"I understand."
"204987124-0-53092";"What will happen if she tries to use the staff?"
"204987124-0-53094";"Then we need to stop her."
"204987124-0-53095";"You could have destroyed time."
"204987124-0-53097";"Do you think the Order will take you back?"
"204987124-0-53098";"What will happen to the Staff of Towers?"
"204987124-0-53099";"The Augur seems fond of Josajeh, and she's a powerful mage. What if she took it into exile?"
"204987124-0-53100";"Can we discuss the Augur of the Obscure? It agreed to help us on the condition that I set it free."
"204987124-0-53101";"Good. I'll take the Augur to her now."
"204987124-0-53103";"I'll take it to Relicmaster Glenadir immediately."
"204987124-0-53105";"Here it is."
"204987124-0-53107";"I have an errand to run, but I'll be there shortly."
"204987124-0-53108";"What kind of rumors?"
"204987124-0-53109";"And what do the Sapiarchs have to do with the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-53110";"So K'Tora has been controlling your actions for all these years?"
"204987124-0-53111";"So K'Tora has been controlling your actions for all these years?"
"204987124-0-53112";"Tell me more about the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-53114";"Disappeared?"
"204987124-0-53115";"And then?"
"204987124-0-53117";"Safe travels, Josajeh."
"204987124-0-53118";"Actually, Josajeh will take it with her into exile."
"204987124-0-53120";"What exactly is this Augur of the Obscure, anyway?"
"204987124-0-53121";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-53122";"Wait, the skull talks?"
"204987124-0-53123";"I'll be careful. What can you tell me about these Psijic Seals?"
"204987124-0-53124";"Good to know. Now, you're sure it will show me these time breaches?"
"204987124-0-53125";"Is there a trick to using them?"
"204987124-0-53126";"What can you tell me about this Augur of the Obscure?"
"204987124-0-53127";"I just haven't seen many of our people here."
"204987124-0-53128";"So Leythen left Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-53129";"I can go warn the tower sentinels."
"204987124-0-53130";"And?"
"204987124-0-53131";"How did you wind up here on Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-53132";"How did you wind up here on Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-53133";"What is this Augur of the Obscure, exactly?"
"204987124-0-53135";"Take me to Elden Root in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-53140";"Thank you. I'll go speak to Josajeh."
"204987124-0-53141";"Remind me, who's Meridia again?"
"204987124-0-53143";"So this map you mentioned will show me where the time breaches are located?"
"204987124-0-53144";"What were those creatures I saw you fighting?"
"204987124-0-53145";"All right, I'll help you investigate the monastery."
"204987124-0-53146";"What are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-53147";"Anything else I should know about this monastery?"
"204987124-0-53148";"A manifestation of …?"
"204987124-0-53149";"The Psijics bound you here?"
"204987124-0-53150";"Are you done?"
"204987124-0-53151";"Well, you did just escape Artaeum."
"204987124-0-53152";"Why did the Psijics go to the trouble of binding you in the first place? Are you really that smart?"
"204987124-0-53153";"Those are just titles, though. Do you have a real name?"
"204987124-0-53154";"Why are you stuck in a crystal skull?"
"204987124-0-53156";"Why are you called the Augur of the Obscure?"
"204987124-0-53157";"You said you're bound to tell the truth?"
"204987124-0-53158";"You said you're bound to tell the truth?"
"204987124-0-53160";"Other victims?"
"204987124-0-53161";"How will I know a spell particle when I see it?"
"204987124-0-53163";"My pleasure."
"204987124-0-53164";"I'll take on a Divine Prosecution contract."
"204987124-0-53167";"Lotus was Queen Ayrenn's pet?"
"204987124-0-53168";"Does she suspect you?"
"204987124-0-53169";"What are the benefits of membership?"
"204987124-0-53170";"Any words of wisdom before I set out?"
"204987124-0-53171";"You're more than just a keeper here, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-53172";"Have any theories as to what we'll find in the Conservatory?"
"204987124-0-53173";"Have any theories as to what we'll find in the Conservatory?"
"204987124-0-53174";"You did really botch this up."
"204987124-0-53175";"All right."
"204987124-0-53176";"K'Tora is dead. I killed him."
"204987124-0-53177";"All right. I'll go rescue Grog."
"204987124-0-53181";"You could do it."
"204987124-0-53199";"Where can I find Sotha Sil? Valsirenn wants him to join the council as well."
"204987124-0-53201";"I think you proved yourself here. Things didn't go to plan, but you got the job done."
"204987124-0-53203";"Do you plan to release her?"
"204987124-0-53204";"What would I have to do?"
"204987124-0-53205";"I'll go inside and see if I can help."
"204987124-0-53206";"Who is this Ghost of the Green?"
"204987124-0-53207";"All right. I'll help you solve this murder."
"204987124-0-53209";"Talomar could probably use your help here."
"204987124-0-53210";"Talomar could probably use your help here."
"204987124-0-53213";"Where do you think you'll travel first?"
"204987124-0-53214";"I was attacked by the other indriks when I was searching for Lotus. Is that normal?"
"204987124-0-53215";"You expect any trouble from Vinelore's people?"
"204987124-0-53216";"I was attacked by the other indriks when I was searching for Lotus. Is that normal?"
"204987124-0-53217";"She made a mistake, but she did save you and Lotus's lives on more than one occasion."
"204987124-0-53218";"Where do you think you'll travel first?"
"204987124-0-53219";"Where do you think you'll travel first?"
"204987124-0-53221";"As long as you have a plan for protecting the Crystal Tower."
"204987124-0-53222";"That sounds like a good idea."
"204987124-0-53230";"Thanks, Raz."
"204987124-0-53231";"You mentioned a reward?"
"204987124-0-53234";"I have an invitation."
"204987124-0-53238";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-53240";"What happened between Valsirenn and Leythen?"
"204987124-0-53241";"Tell me more about the Dreaming Cave."
"204987124-0-53244";"What are you doing in Shimmerene?"
"204987124-0-53245";"Are your fellow Welkynars well?"
"204987124-0-53251";"So you'll remain here."
"204987124-0-53262";"Fair enough."
"204987124-0-53263";"And the other two?"
"204987124-0-53264";"These wines sound quite fancy. Tell me more about the Russafeld winery."
"204987124-0-53265";"And the third bottle?"
"204987124-0-53266";"Celarus told me that the Augur will light a path to the fragments. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-53267";"Celarus told me that the Augur will light a path to the fragments. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-53269";"All right. We'll find Castire and put an end to this."
"204987124-0-53271";"I'll find the stone."
"204987124-0-53273";"It sounds like the triad of Daedric Princes isn't as united as we thought."
"204987124-0-53277";"I'll let the Ritemaster know."
"204987124-0-53278";"So what do the words mean?"
"204987124-0-53279";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-53281";"All right. I'm sorry about what happened."
"204987124-0-53283";"How did you wind up in service to Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-53284";"How did you wind up in service to Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-53285";"You know we're going to stop the triad of Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-53287";"What does the triad of Daedric Princes hope to achieve?"
"204987124-0-53289";"You're welcome. What's next?"
"204987124-0-53290";"What are your duties?"
"204987124-0-53291";"I don't know if you remember, but we actually met in Ebon Stadmont."
"204987124-0-53292";"Who do you guide?"
"204987124-0-53293";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-53294";"All right. Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-53295";"Did you give your research to the Mage's Guild?"
"204987124-0-53296";"Do you miss Artaeum?"
"204987124-0-53298";"What do you plan to do now?"
"204987124-0-53300";"Why keep on meeting in secret? There must have been a better way."
"204987124-0-53301";"Thank you for all your help."
"204987124-0-53302";"Daedric Anchors?"
"204987124-0-53304";"Yes. I'd like to join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-53308";"Daedric Anchors?"
"204987124-0-53310";"In that case, I'll join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-53312";"What do I get in return?"
"204987124-0-53314";"Very well. I'd like to join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-53315";"What does the Guild provide me with?"
"204987124-0-53317";"Very well. I'll join the Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-53318";"A pearl?"
"204987124-0-53320";"I'll stop Justiciar Avanaire and destroy the pearl."
"204987124-0-53321";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-53323";"I'll rescue Niralin, or bring back evidence of her death."
"204987124-0-53325";"Tell me everything you remember."
"204987124-0-53326";"I'll go with you to the Dreaming Cave."
"204987124-0-53328";"That doesn't sound too terrible."
"204987124-0-53330";"I'll ask some questions around the city."
"204987124-0-53331";"So how can I help?"
"204987124-0-53333";"I'll ask some questions around the city."
"204987124-0-53334";"What do you think the memory means?"
"204987124-0-53336";"I'll do what I can to help."
"204987124-0-53337";"Your father's never talked about his past?"
"204987124-0-53338";"Do you know where I can find her?"
"204987124-0-53339";"Your father's never talked about his past?"
"204987124-0-53342";"It was nothing."
"204987124-0-53344";"Why'd you keep your military service a secret? Even from your own daughter."
"204987124-0-53345";"Where is that?"
"204987124-0-53346";"Hiranesse deserves to hear the truth from you."
"204987124-0-53347";"She just want to know her father."
"204987124-0-53348";"She just want to know her father."
"204987124-0-53349";"Why would she hate the sea?"
"204987124-0-53351";"Did you meet your wife in the Royal Navy?"
"204987124-0-53352";"Hiranesse deserves to hear the truth from you."
"204987124-0-53353";"Why'd you keep your military service a secret? Even from your own daughter."
"204987124-0-53354";"You mentioned a barrier."
"204987124-0-53355";"You mentioned a barrier."
"204987124-0-53356";"Has the Golden Knight recovered from the wounds he sustained in Mephala's realm?"
"204987124-0-53357";"You mentioned a barrier."
"204987124-0-53358";"So what do the words mean?"
"204987124-0-53359";"Darien is on his way back, and he's bringing Leythen with him."
"204987124-0-53361";"I'll go talk to Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-53362";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-53364";"I'll find Oriandra and get the amplification elixir."
"204987124-0-53365";"How can we get the Sapiarchs to agree to that?"
"204987124-0-53366";"I'll help you convince the Sapiarchs, if I can."
"204987124-0-53368";"That's what this is about? Nocturnal wants to destroy Nirn?"
"204987124-0-53370";"So why betray the other Princes?"
"204987124-0-53371";"I'll find a way to stop you."
"204987124-0-53372";"So why betray the other Princes?"
"204987124-0-53374";"Then you're leaving him?"
"204987124-0-53375";"What did you mean about Tableau's stage name?"
"204987124-0-53376";"And they don't normally keep their stage name when they leave the troupe?"
"204987124-0-53377";"Did you stop Manacar from entering this party?"
"204987124-0-53378";"Why does Nocturnal want the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"204987124-0-53379";"Who's Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-53380";"Why does Nocturnal want the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"204987124-0-53381";"Why does Nocturnal want the Heart of Transparent Law?"
"204987124-0-53382";"You don't seem very concerned for your husband."
"204987124-0-53383";"What kind of dog is Eustasia?"
"204987124-0-53384";"You don't seem very concerned for your husband."
"204987124-0-53385";"What would happen?"
"204987124-0-53386";"You said Josajeh might use the mine as a springboard to an unfamiliar place?"
"204987124-0-53387";"All right."
"204987124-0-53388";"Whatever Nocturnal has planned is a threat to Mephala and the rest of the Court of Bedlam."
"204987124-0-53389";"You're really callous, you know that?"
"204987124-0-53392";"But the White-Gold Tower is overrun by Molag Bal's Daedra."
"204987124-0-53395";"How do you feel about Leythen's death?"
"204987124-0-53397";"What happens to the Court of Bedlam now?"
"204987124-0-53398";"Of course."
"204987124-0-53399";"Of course. What's the Psijic Order's plans now?"
"204987124-0-53401";"So no end of the world threat looming over us?"
"204987124-0-53402";"Why do you need me for this? You are the most powerful mages on Nirn."
"204987124-0-53403";"The White-Gold Tower … detached from time?"
"204987124-0-53404";"Why would you want gryphon eggs?"
"204987124-0-53406";"How do you feel about Leythen's death?"
"204987124-0-53408";"And that will stop it?"
"204987124-0-53410";"Is that why you lied to me?"
"204987124-0-53412";"What will happen if the staff fails to contain it?"
"204987124-0-53413";"Why do you need me for this? You are the most powerful mages on Nirn."
"204987124-0-53414";"Or?"
"204987124-0-53415";"And Sotha Sil is fine with you being in here?"
"204987124-0-53416";"Fair enough. What are you up to now?"
"204987124-0-53417";"Temporary?"
"204987124-0-53418";"Is Sotha Sil all right with you going through his things?"
"204987124-0-53419";"Can't the other Psijics help you regain your power?"
"204987124-0-53420";"I saved Clockwork City from Nocturnal. I even saved Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-53421";"So you'll never regain the power you lost?"
"204987124-0-53422";"Nocturnal created a shadow Sotha Sil to usurp his throne. I freed the real Seht and foiled her plan."
"204987124-0-53423";"What have you been up to since we stopped that shadow on Dranil Kir?"
"204987124-0-53424";"Have you been to Clockwork City since the way opened?"
"204987124-0-53425";"What kind of matters require you to leave the island?"
"204987124-0-53427";"Good luck, and be careful."
"204987124-0-53428";"If you know everything, don't you already know what I'm going to do?"
"204987124-0-53429";"I wanted to ask you about something else."
"204987124-0-53432";"I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet."
"204987124-0-53433";"Did you enjoy our travels?"
"204987124-0-53434";"So, do you feel any different about us ""meat-brains"" now?"
"204987124-0-53436";"Did you enjoy our travels?"
"204987124-0-53437";"Thank you?"
"204987124-0-53438";"And if I set you free?"
"204987124-0-53439";"So, do you feel any different about us ""meat-brains"" now?"
"204987124-0-53440";"Guess I have some thinking to do."
"204987124-0-53441";"Right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-53443";"Shouldn't Leythen be locked away somewhere?"
"204987124-0-53446";"Why are you trying to make a record of the battles that occurred here?"
"204987124-0-53448";"All right, I'll help you finish your epic."
"204987124-0-53450";"Hold on, I think you're getting ahead of yourself."
"204987124-0-53451";"All right, I'll help you finish your epic."
"204987124-0-53453";"Why would he do that?"
"204987124-0-53456";"He seems talented enough to join."
"204987124-0-53457";"So you work for the House of Reveries, but you're not in the troupe?"
"204987124-0-53459";"What's your relationship to Mehdze?"
"204987124-0-53461";"What are these notes for exactly?"
"204987124-0-53462";"What are these notes for exactly?"
"204987124-0-53463";"Why are you willing to risk your life for these notes?"
"204987124-0-53464";"""Captain Kalgah, please stay. I think I've fallen in love with you."""
"204987124-0-53465";"""Will you ever come back?"""
"204987124-0-53466";"""We could run away together."""
"204987124-0-53469";"Amazing. I think this is stage ready."
"204987124-0-53471";"Has Valsirenn finished attuning the Resolute Diamonds yet?"
"204987124-0-53472";"Any news on the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-53473";"Has Valsirenn finished attuning the Resolute Diamonds yet?"
"204987124-0-53474";"Why doesn't he want people to enter this place?"
"204987124-0-53476";"All right, if it will keep you out of harms way. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-53477";"You're more than just a keeper here, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-53478";"So much for your grand plans."
"204987124-0-53480";"Where exactly are we then?"
"204987124-0-53481";"What can you tell me about the recent killings?"
"204987124-0-53483";"So you've moved the island to keep it safe?"
"204987124-0-53484";"Any guess as to the cause?"
"204987124-0-53485";"What exactly is the Dreaming Cave?"
"204987124-0-53487";"What can you tell me about the tower's origins?"
"204987124-0-53488";"Tell me more about the Dreaming Cave."
"204987124-0-53489";"So who created the tower?"
"204987124-0-53490";"What are the Divine Prosecution doing to resolve the situation?"
"204987124-0-53491";"What can you tell me about the recent killings?"
"204987124-0-53492";"There's a mechanism under a candelabra on the second floor. See for yourself."
"204987124-0-53493";"I am an investigator for the Proxy Queen. I have some questions."
"204987124-0-53494";"Isn't that a good thing?"
"204987124-0-53495";"What sort of measures?"
"204987124-0-53499";"I haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been?"
"204987124-0-53500";"You look Breton, but what are you really?"
"204987124-0-53501";"Why did Meridia send you to her realm?"
"204987124-0-53502";"What does Meridia want you to do?"
"204987124-0-53503";"Did Meridia tell you anything?"
"204987124-0-53504";"I haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been?"
"204987124-0-53505";"Such as?"
"204987124-0-53506";"I could get used to this."
"204987124-0-53507";"I haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been?"
"204987124-0-53508";"I haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been?"
"204987124-0-53510";"What have you been up to since we last crossed paths?"
"204987124-0-53511";"You think they're still a threat?"
"204987124-0-53513";"Good hunting. Take care of yourself, Silurie."
"204987124-0-53514";"Your side investigation?"
"204987124-0-53515";"Has that worked out?"
"204987124-0-53516";"Do you think this is the last we'll see of them?"
"204987124-0-53518";"I wish you the best of luck in that pursuit."
"204987124-0-53519";"Your life is pretty complicated too, if I recall. How have things been with Silurie?"
"204987124-0-53520";"I thought you didn't approve of foreign magic."
"204987124-0-53522";"I hope your relationship with Silurie only continues to improve."
"204987124-0-53523";"What kind of spell did she use?"
"204987124-0-53525";"Will she be punished?"
"204987124-0-53526";"So I'm looking for these places where the waves wash up? More breaches?"
"204987124-0-53528";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-53529";"What have you been up to since you escaped?"
"204987124-0-53530";"Is that a bad thing?"
"204987124-0-53531";"You made it home, I see."
"204987124-0-53532";"You're right. I'm sorry I didn't make more of an effort to help you."
"204987124-0-53535";"You think the ruins are the source of the disappearances?"
"204987124-0-53537";"I can look for your friends."
"204987124-0-53538";"So someone stole the relics?"
"204987124-0-53539";"If you know the locations, why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-53540";"I'm working with Razum-dar, one of the Queen's Eyes. But what happened to the pearl?"
"204987124-0-53543";"I think you're lucky she hasn't beaten you to pulp. Take her apology and go."
"204987124-0-53544";"I think you're lucky she hasn't beaten you to pulp. Take her apology and go."
"204987124-0-53545";"You're blowing this out of proportion. Just let it go."
"204987124-0-53546";"Where did you get something like this?"
"204987124-0-53548";"Didn't the Ritemaster place protections on the pearl?"
"204987124-0-53550";"If all that was in my mind, how come I still have the items I found there?"
"204987124-0-53552";"And who is the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-0-53553";"Tell me more about the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-53554";"What do the Sapiarchs have to do with the Crystal Tower?"
"204987124-0-53555";"And who is the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-0-53556";"Why is the Crystal Tower so important?"
"204987124-0-53557";"If you needed help on this, why not bring Oriandra?"
"204987124-0-53558";"Tell me more about the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-53559";"What kind of rumors?"
"204987124-0-53560";"Tell me more about the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-0-53561";"You said it will be harder to access the Crystal Tower now?"
"204987124-0-53562";"How did you survive?"
"204987124-0-53563";"If we want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else, I need to know how to get out of here."
"204987124-0-53564";"You're right. Making an alliance with the betrayed Princes is our best option right now."
"204987124-0-53566";"Tell me about the spell you're performing."
"204987124-0-53567";"<Enter Cloudrest.>"
"204987124-0-53570";"So what do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-53571";"Do you believe that's true?"
"204987124-0-53572";"Why would she need such a large pack?"
"204987124-0-53573";"So you're a member of the Silver Dawn?"
"204987124-0-53574";"So the Silver Dawn originally owned this keep?"
"204987124-0-53575";"Who is Vykosa?"
"204987124-0-53576";"You think your companions may now be werewolves?"
"204987124-0-53577";"All right. Now, why do you need wolfsbane flowers?"
"204987124-0-53578";"So this wolfsbane can cure lycanthropy?"
"204987124-0-53580";"What will you do if you can't be cured?"
"204987124-0-53581";"Could you find the ingredients later?"
"204987124-0-53584";"Then why didn't you?"
"204987124-0-53585";"So you enjoy being a werewolf?"
"204987124-0-53587";"How do you know so much about the keep?"
"204987124-0-53589";"Remind me, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-53590";"Seems odd for a pack of werewolves to have an archivist."
"204987124-0-53591";"Why would Vykosa make such a garden?"
"204987124-0-53592";"It almost sounds like you were part of these experiments."
"204987124-0-53593";"But you were able to fight back?"
"204987124-0-53594";"And you gave Adonatus that poison to kill himself."
"204987124-0-53596";"Speaking of companions, you seem to have picked one up."
"204987124-0-53597";"Is a cure really so hard to find?"
"204987124-0-53598";"So what have you heard about the garden?"
"204987124-0-53599";"Anything in particular I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-53600";"And werewolves also come here after they die?"
"204987124-0-53601";"What happened to your father?"
"204987124-0-53602";"And you want to help us defeat Vykosa?"
"204987124-0-53608";"His experiments?"
"204987124-0-53612";"A hare? I thought it looked like a deer."
"204987124-0-53613";"You think they may attack us?"
"204987124-0-53615";"I'm sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-53616";"A reward?"
"204987124-0-53621";"But I thought you hated all werewolves."
"204987124-0-53623";"So Vykosa imprisoned you."
"204987124-0-53624";"What did you give to Adonatus?"
"204987124-0-53625";"So you're a werewolf."
"204987124-0-53626";"But you didn't admit you were a werewolf when we first met."
"204987124-0-53627";"But you didn't admit you were a werewolf when we first met."
"204987124-0-53630";"Why would you be trapped? You're not a werewolf."
"204987124-0-53631";"But I was able to kill them."
"204987124-0-53633";"Is that what your father wants?"
"204987124-0-53634";"You're making the right choice."
"204987124-0-53636";"We at least know the Wood Elf team was killed."
"204987124-0-53637";"Any idea of how we can take the creature down?"
"204987124-0-53638";"He doesn't seem like a follower of Hircine though."
"204987124-0-53639";"You're making the right choice."
"204987124-0-53642";"And what favor do you want to ask Hircine?"
"204987124-0-53645";"You don't seem to have a high opinion of Hircine."
"204987124-0-53647";"What will you ask Hircine to grant you?"
"204987124-0-53649";"Do you think yourself capable of hunting this indrik?"
"204987124-0-53650";"So your father found one of these wisps for us?"
"204987124-0-53652";"What can I expect here?"
"204987124-0-53653";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-53654";"If I'm to aid you, I'll need to know more about the Hunting Grounds."
"204987124-0-53655";"What did she tell you?"
"204987124-0-53656";"You seem to know a lot about the Great Hunt."
"204987124-0-53657";"Then can you tell me more about where we are?"
"204987124-0-53658";"And what can you tell me about this indrik we're hunting?"
"204987124-0-53660";"All right. Now, who were those women who just attacked us?"
"204987124-0-53661";"Your father seemed to think you shouldn't be here."
"204987124-0-53662";"What can I expect within the Wispwood?"
"204987124-0-53663";"They could also be dead by now."
"204987124-0-53664";"Right. So, what exactly is that light your father gave us?"
"204987124-0-53665";"We also have to worry about Balorgh. Any idea who he is?"
"204987124-0-53666";"Speaking of Tarcyr, any idea of what it did to those Nords?"
"204987124-0-53668";"Save your father. Do what you feel is right."
"204987124-0-53669";"Why try to save him now?"
"204987124-0-53671";"What kind of favor are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-53679";"I need to find out about a collector named Margus Derius."
"204987124-0-53687";"What can you tell me about a person named Margus Derius?"
"204987124-0-53688";"I haven't acquired the wamasu egg yet."
"204987124-0-53689";"Tell me more about this cave."
"204987124-0-53690";"I'll get you the wamasu egg."
"204987124-0-53694";"So we're too late."
"204987124-0-53696";"I won't let that happen."
"204987124-0-53697";"Meet Xode on top of the western xanmeer. We'll decide our next move from there."
"204987124-0-53698";"You're in no condition to pick a fight. Find Xode, he should be at the top of the western xanmeer."
"204987124-0-53701";"The dastardly scoundrel you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-53703";"What should I look for in the Outlaws Refuge?"
"204987124-0-53706";"How do I weaken the Wuju-Ka?"
"204987124-0-53708";"How long have you worked for Cyrodilic Collections?"
"204987124-0-53711";"Are these items significant in some way?"
"204987124-0-53712";"I'll go have another talk with Eshundir."
"204987124-0-53713";"I was hoping Eshundir could tell me about these Argonian antiquities."
"204987124-0-53716";"Good idea. I'll take a look around."
"204987124-0-53717";"Where did Concordia go?"
"204987124-0-53719";"I'm ready. Let's go!"
"204987124-0-53720";"I'm ready. Let's go!"
"204987124-0-53721";"What does that mean, you departed the world?"
"204987124-0-53722";"Tell me more about the mind trap."
"204987124-0-53723";"Who or what is K'Tora?"
"204987124-0-53724";"Other victims?"
"204987124-0-53725";"If it was all in my mind, how come I still have the items I found there?"
"204987124-0-53726";"Tell me about the Psijic Order."
"204987124-0-53727";"How do we find these Argonians so we can check on them?"
"204987124-0-53730";"So you want to pay me to find the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-53732";"All right. I'll find Xukas and learn what I can about the Remnant."
"204987124-0-53733";"How were you captured?"
"204987124-0-53734";"Is it unusual for a high priestess of Sithis to make blood sacrifices?"
"204987124-0-53735";"How are the new ways different?"
"204987124-0-53745";"Thank you. How should we proceed?"
"204987124-0-53750";"Where can I find this Chime-Maker Shuvu?"
"204987124-0-53754";"If you don't help me, they're going to get their hands on the cursed skull."
"204987124-0-53755";"There must be something you can tell me."
"204987124-0-53756";"Is this enough to spark your memory?"
"204987124-0-53758";"And how is Margus going to do that?"
"204987124-0-53759";"Is there anything else you can tell me that would help me stop him?"
"204987124-0-53760";"If you help me stop them, then you won't have to worry about the safety of your family."
"204987124-0-53762";"I'm working with Cyrodilic Collections, if that's what you're asking."
"204987124-0-53766";"The ritual involves meditation cylinders and must be performed on an island called Norg-Tzel."
"204987124-0-53768";"The Argonians I spoke to said something similar."
"204987124-0-53769";"Good to know. Any advice on how to avoid that sort of thing?"
"204987124-0-53770";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-53772";"What can you tell me about Famia?"
"204987124-0-53776";"What kind of dangers will we find in the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-53777";"What can you tell me about Famia?"
"204987124-0-53778";"What can you tell me about Famia?"
"204987124-0-53780";"Where can we find a potent magical focus?"
"204987124-0-53782";"So, where are these vakka stones?"
"204987124-0-53783";"What's the rush?"
"204987124-0-53786";"One of the Argonians mentioned the ship was moored near Deep Graves."
"204987124-0-53797";"All right. Let's go convince the ship's pilot to take us to Norg-Tzel."
"204987124-0-53799";"Why aren't you participating in the bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-53801";"What happened to the seed-doll?"
"204987124-0-53802";"If I recover the seed-doll, will you participate in the bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-53807";"So what changed?"
"204987124-0-53811";"Are you volunteering?"
"204987124-0-53814";"You only gave me your name. Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-53815";"Sure. Here's everything I found. Be seeing you."
"204987124-0-53818";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-53820";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-53821";"<Enter Frostvault.>"
"204987124-0-53822";"The Empire has the other half of the tablet?"
"204987124-0-53824";"Impressed enough to reward me?"
"204987124-0-53825";"<Enter Depths of Malatar.>"
"204987124-0-53827";"All right. We'll cooperate."
"204987124-0-53833";"I'm ready to begin our search."
"204987124-0-53840";"You know where I can find them?"
"204987124-0-53842";"What did the Imperial Legion use the cavern for?"
"204987124-0-53843";"So you'll be joining the bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-53846";"I'll let the Bright-Throats know you'll be participating."
"204987124-0-53847";"What happened to your dowry?"
"204987124-0-53849";"You're saying you stole your dowry from your betrothed? Why?"
"204987124-0-53850";"All right, I'll try to get your dowry back."
"204987124-0-53864";"I'll let the Bright-Throats know you've agreed to participate."
"204987124-0-53867";"Dread Fathering Elixir? Did it kill him?"
"204987124-0-53868";"There must be something we can do."
"204987124-0-53869";"Let me try to help Kishi instead. Your tribe's laws don't apply to me."
"204987124-0-53870";"Kishi's letter mentioned an old training manual."
"204987124-0-53874";"What do you need? Maybe I can find it for you."
"204987124-0-53876";"Good luck. I'll let the Bright-Throats know after I've spoken to the other suitors."
"204987124-0-53888";"Very well."
"204987124-0-53889";"You make it sound like this is ancient history."
"204987124-0-53891";"What can you tell me about the Teeth of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-53892";"You believe it's really the priestess from your story?"
"204987124-0-53893";"How will this help us find the Remnant of Argon?"
"204987124-0-53894";"Mash it up a bit?"
"204987124-0-53898";"Kassandra asked me to meet her in Alten Meerhleel. I'll see if she can help."
"204987124-0-53899";"Join them where, exactly?"
"204987124-0-53900";"A riddle. ""Smoke of stars to see what once was seen, sunless sap to hear what once was heard."""
"204987124-0-53902";"I'll go meet up with Kassandra."
"204987124-0-53903";"Margus and the Blackguards are looking for powerful Argonian relics. They have a hidden storehouse."
"204987124-0-53905";"I'll head there immediately."
"204987124-0-53906";"It's in a cave called the Sunless Hollow."
"204987124-0-53908";"Why are you so intent on opposing the ka-deelith?"
"204987124-0-53911";"The Blackguards think tribal relics will lead them to the Remnant. Are these grave-stakes special?"
"204987124-0-53912";"Could the Remnant's secrets be carved onto one of these grave-stakes?"
"204987124-0-53914";"I'll meet you outside the village."
"204987124-0-53916";"You want me to drink this?"
"204987124-0-53917";"Sounds good. What do we have to do?"
"204987124-0-53918";"All right, I'll destroy the fumers and recover the grave-stakes."
"204987124-0-53921";"And his grave-stake will lead to the Remnant of Argon?"
"204987124-0-53922";"You'll help me fight him, right?"
"204987124-0-53924";"All right. I'll claim Etra's grave-stake and meet you at the grave-singer's lodge."
"204987124-0-53925";"Does it say where the Remnant is?"
"204987124-0-53926";"It must mean something. If we just—"
"204987124-0-53928";"Thank you. I'll meet you at Cyrodilic Collections Headquarters."
"204987124-0-53929";"A dream-wallow?"
"204987124-0-53932";"I'll go get you that wamasu egg now."
"204987124-0-53933";"If you help me stop them, then you won't have to worry about the safety of your family."
"204987124-0-53934";"All right, take this and tell me the rest."
"204987124-0-53935";"Let me give you some money, then."
"204987124-0-53937";"Let me give you some money, then."
"204987124-0-53938";"If you help me stop them, then you won't have to worry about your family any more."
"204987124-0-53940";"If you help me stop them, then you won't have to worry about your family any more."
"204987124-0-53941";"Your tribe prefers death to receiving a second chance?"
"204987124-0-53942";"What does an ancient sorcerer have to do with all this?"
"204987124-0-53943";"Who is Mewah-Jez?"
"204987124-0-53946";"Thank you. Farewell."
"204987124-0-53947";"Ready? I guess so."
"204987124-0-53949";"What does all this have to do with Bhoki and the rite of passage?"
"204987124-0-53952";"Is that the only reason?"
"204987124-0-53954";"Why not? What do you know about the Kajin-Jat Crystal?"
"204987124-0-53957";"I'm happy for you. Now, you mentioned payment?"
"204987124-0-53959";"All right. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-53960";"Why do you want this crystal?"
"204987124-0-53961";"So, who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-53962";"All right, I'll join your expedition."
"204987124-0-53964";"Any idea where it came from?"
"204987124-0-53969";"… Lungs?"
"204987124-0-53971";"All right. I'll go to these locations and give a shout."
"204987124-0-53975";"Tell me more about Margus Derius."
"204987124-0-53976";"Where do I meet Mindileth again?"
"204987124-0-53978";"Maybe I can help you find it."
"204987124-0-53980";"How did the lizard escape?"
"204987124-0-53981";"Fair enough. Once I collect these venom sacs, what do I do with them?"
"204987124-0-53983";"All right. Have you heard the one about the horse?"
"204987124-0-53984";"And your friend?"
"204987124-0-53985";"Why should you avoid making Molag Bal mad?"
"204987124-0-53986";"When should you avoid a blacksmith?"
"204987124-0-53987";"Don't worry—you're just a little horse."
"204987124-0-53989";"Thanks. So long."
"204987124-0-53990";"A tale of WHOA!"
"204987124-0-53992";"Thanks for the advice. So long."
"204987124-0-53993";"A pony goes to a healer and says he's got a sore throat."
"204987124-0-53994";"Thoroughbred."
"204987124-0-53996";"I will. Farewell!"
"204987124-0-53997";"We're most concerned about storms that could delay the expedition."
"204987124-0-53999";"He always Coldharbours a grudge."
"204987124-0-54001";"Thanks. So long."
"204987124-0-54002";"She's the Prince of Plots."
"204987124-0-54003";"Tentacles."
"204987124-0-54005";"Thanks. So long."
"204987124-0-54007";"Will do. So long."
"204987124-0-54009";"I'll let Cyrodilic Collections know of your prediction."
"204987124-0-54011";"When she's lost her temper."
"204987124-0-54013";"I will. Farewell."
"204987124-0-54014";"Because an enchanter had runed it."
"204987124-0-54016";"I will. Farewell."
"204987124-0-54017";"He wasn't suited for the job."
"204987124-0-54019";"I will. So long."
"204987124-0-54020";"When will your break be over?"
"204987124-0-54022";"Thank you. Farewell."
"204987124-0-54023";"No thanks. I'll make it worth your while if you just sell me the salt."
"204987124-0-54025";"All right. I'll be right back."
"204987124-0-54027";"Let's not haggle then. This ought to be enough to cover the salt and then some."
"204987124-0-54029";"All right. Give me a minute."
"204987124-0-54031";"Thank you. Farewell."
"204987124-0-54033";"You plan to return every item you find?"
"204987124-0-54034";"So you're really just going to return these items to the Argonians?"
"204987124-0-54035";"Duskfall?"
"204987124-0-54036";"And what did he reveal?"
"204987124-0-54037";"What does Cyrodilic Collections do exactly?"
"204987124-0-54038";"You mentioned an expedition to Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54039";"Tell me more about Margus Derius."
"204987124-0-54040";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54041";"I'd like to help. What is it you need?"
"204987124-0-54046";"Tell me about ash basil."
"204987124-0-54047";"All right. Tell me what you want me to do."
"204987124-0-54049";"Cyrodilic Collections? What's that?"
"204987124-0-54050";"Why the focus on Argonian antiquities?"
"204987124-0-54052";"What else can you tell me about this cave?"
"204987124-0-54055";"Tell me where this cave is located."
"204987124-0-54059";"You think the Goblins would be interested in Dwarven civilization?"
"204987124-0-54062";"We don't know that for certain, but there is a connection here. Where is this trail leading?"
"204987124-0-54065";"You really think you can fix this?"
"204987124-0-54066";"What are shock conveyors?"
"204987124-0-54067";"Where can I find these shock conveyors?"
"204987124-0-54069";"What is its function?"
"204987124-0-54072";"Do I need to stick around for her to finish the anti-venom?"
"204987124-0-54073";"Anything you can tell me about Margus Derius would be appreciated."
"204987124-0-54075";"Who are the Blackguards?"
"204987124-0-54077";"You're saying she's never borne children?"
"204987124-0-54079";"Seed? Do you mean the Remnant of Argon?"
"204987124-0-54080";"How can I find the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-54082";"Thank you. If it will help guide me to the Remnant, I'll take your staff."
"204987124-0-54083";"And what about superior dreugh wax?"
"204987124-0-54084";"Tell me more about ash basil."
"204987124-0-54085";"Tell me about ash basil."
"204987124-0-54086";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-54088";"And what will you be doing in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-54089";"Tell me more about Margus Derius."
"204987124-0-54091";"Where did your assistant go?"
"204987124-0-54092";"Are you sure I'm the one who should undertake the dream-wallow?"
"204987124-0-54093";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-54094";"How can you be sure?"
"204987124-0-54095";"Yes. He found deep sap. He said Bright-Throats use it in their dream-wallow rituals."
"204987124-0-54096";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54097";"I can do that. Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-54098";"Are you sure? Will combining your rituals even work?"
"204987124-0-54100";"What changed to cause all this?"
"204987124-0-54101";"So what can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-54103";"Do you really think we'll find the Remnant in the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-0-54105";"I'll make my way to the Swallowed Grove now."
"204987124-0-54106";"Who are the Nagas?"
"204987124-0-54111";"What did you do to impress her and secure the deal?"
"204987124-0-54113";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-54114";"Does Captain Jimila hire you for protection often?"
"204987124-0-54116";"So how did you impress the Captain and earn her trust?"
"204987124-0-54118";"Unless you sell vossa-satls, you have nothing to worry about."
"204987124-0-54120";"The Prowler?"
"204987124-0-54124";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-54125";"Why do you need me to gather frogs?"
"204987124-0-54127";"I have a couple of questions before I agree to gather these frogs."
"204987124-0-54128";"I'll meet you inside."
"204987124-0-54131";"Did you get your hands on any of this correspondence?"
"204987124-0-54132";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-54134";"All right, I'll ask Lozwug about the game."
"204987124-0-54135";"How many balls?"
"204987124-0-54136";"Thanks for the explanation."
"204987124-0-54137";"What did the other team do?"
"204987124-0-54138";"So the Dragonstar Caravan Company has been spying on Famia?"
"204987124-0-54139";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-54141";"All right, I'll search the depot for more clues."
"204987124-0-54142";"A nightmare idol? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-54143";"I found spy reports. Many of them are addressed to a group called the Blackguards."
"204987124-0-54145";"Right. I found spy reports. Many of them are addressed to a group called the Blackguards."
"204987124-0-54146";"I found this unusual weapon, too. Any idea who it belongs to?"
"204987124-0-54148";"All right, I'll talk to Famia."
"204987124-0-54149";"You're good friends with a Dead-Water Naga?"
"204987124-0-54150";"We'll find them. Xukas thinks we might be able to get more information from the Dead-Water tribe."
"204987124-0-54151";"Your benefactor? Who's that?"
"204987124-0-54153";"Where?"
"204987124-0-54155";"Tell me more about the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar."
"204987124-0-54156";"Why would anyone want a cursed skull?"
"204987124-0-54157";"And what's in it for you?"
"204987124-0-54158";"And who are the Blackguards?"
"204987124-0-54159";"What kind of arcane ritual?"
"204987124-0-54160";"Remind me about you and your organization."
"204987124-0-54161";"What are you hoping to find inside the caverns?"
"204987124-0-54162";"You know her well? What are her flaws?"
"204987124-0-54164";"How so?"
"204987124-0-54165";"How do you propose we do that?"
"204987124-0-54167";"All right, stay close."
"204987124-0-54168";"Why do you think Tsofeer Cavern holds the answers you seek?"
"204987124-0-54169";"What are you hoping to find inside the caverns?"
"204987124-0-54170";"If they have Famia's explorers, we have a common enemy."
"204987124-0-54172";"No questions from me. Let's start the raid."
"204987124-0-54173";"You don't think there will be repercussions?"
"204987124-0-54174";"I want to interrogate the prisoner before I decide anything."
"204987124-0-54176";"You're going to have to be more persuasive. Is there anything else you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-54177";"The Remnant of Argon?"
"204987124-0-54179";"I have to think about this."
"204987124-0-54180";"All right. She goes free. [Hostia lives]"
"204987124-0-54182";"You're right. She's proven too dangerous. Do what you have to do. [Hostia dies]"
"204987124-0-54184";"All right. I'll tell Famia."
"204987124-0-54186";"All right. I'll inform Famia."
"204987124-0-54188";"The key to what?"
"204987124-0-54189";"Tell me more about the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar."
"204987124-0-54190";"Tell me more about the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar."
"204987124-0-54193";"All this because Kishi broke tradition and saved the lives of a few novice warriors?"
"204987124-0-54194";"Enough, I'm sure. We should assume they know everything you know."
"204987124-0-54195";"Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn seemed very reluctant to discuss the Remnant."
"204987124-0-54196";"Only that someone was willing to pay a lot of gold for information about it."
"204987124-0-54198";"So what's your plan to stop them?"
"204987124-0-54199";"You couldn't determine anything else about the ritual?"
"204987124-0-54203";"Why are they so rare?"
"204987124-0-54204";"How did you gain the power to predict storms?"
"204987124-0-54205";"And why are you sending me off to scream?"
"204987124-0-54206";"Then why not live in a temple?"
"204987124-0-54207";"Fair enough. How did you come upon your power, anyway?"
"204987124-0-54208";"And then you'll be able to predict the weather?"
"204987124-0-54211";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-54212";"I'll help you prove Bhoki's techniques."
"204987124-0-54213";"Bhoki said you had a plan."
"204987124-0-54216";"No, but a clue led us to the Chid-Moska Ruins. That's where I recovered this nightmare idol."
"204987124-0-54217";"So we have to perform this ritual ""in a garden, in a maw of stone""?"
"204987124-0-54218";"If I succeed, won't that prove that Kishi is right?"
"204987124-0-54221";"I'll return with the sacred lily."
"204987124-0-54222";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-54223";"I'm ready to return to Shadowfen."
"204987124-0-54224";"I hope you're right about this."
"204987124-0-54225";"Why did you want me to drink that?"
"204987124-0-54226";"Couldn't you have done this yourself?"
"204987124-0-54228";"I'll keep that in mind."
"204987124-0-54235";"We found the Kajin-Jat crystal before. We can find another vakka stone around here somewhere."
"204987124-0-54236";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-54238";"Cyrodilic Collections is looking for dangerous relics?"
"204987124-0-54239";"Is that how the sacred candles work?"
"204987124-0-54240";"How will I know them?"
"204987124-0-54241";"What should I expect to encounter at the Teeth of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-54243";"What do you make of this green liquid?"
"204987124-0-54244";"What do you make of this green liquid?"
"204987124-0-54245";"Would you look at this orange liquid I found?"
"204987124-0-54247";"I used up all the fire stones."
"204987124-0-54251";"So my first goal is to use the vine-tongues to move across the quicksand?"
"204987124-0-54252";"Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-54253";"Is it unusual for a high priestess of Sithis to make blood sacrifices?"
"204987124-0-54254";"What did the Hist share with you?"
"204987124-0-54256";"What should I expect to encounter at the Teeth of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-54257";"Her notes mentioned other matured hatchlings being sequestered. I don't think these are them."
"204987124-0-54258";"I'll handle Ree-Nakal. Just try to keep out of harms way."
"204987124-0-54263";"So you've triggered traps like this before?"
"204987124-0-54264";"Right. So, do you have any lock picks?"
"204987124-0-54265";"Did you lose the pouch?"
"204987124-0-54266";"I'll find it. What do you think happened to the others?"
"204987124-0-54268";"She's not really a child, is she?"
"204987124-0-54270";"We can't just leave her here, that much is true."
"204987124-0-54271";"The murderer dropped a note. It says Margus is gathering the Blackguards at the Chid-Moska Ruins."
"204987124-0-54272";"Do you think that's what they're after in the ruins?"
"204987124-0-54273";"So what does all this mean? What is Margus Derius actually looking for?"
"204987124-0-54275";"Who or what is Deroh-Zah?"
"204987124-0-54278";"Are all Argonians from Murkmire interested in ancient Argonian history?"
"204987124-0-54279";"How do you figure that?"
"204987124-0-54280";"Does she pay you well?"
"204987124-0-54281";"Will you honor Kishi's request regarding the training of the novices?"
"204987124-0-54282";"I'll tell Kishi the news."
"204987124-0-54283";"What will happen to Mewah-Jez?"
"204987124-0-54286";"The war-chief also said he wants Mewah-Jez to assist you."
"204987124-0-54290";"What does the Hist tell you?"
"204987124-0-54291";"I need to think about this."
"204987124-0-54293";"They pose too great a risk to the tribe."
"204987124-0-54294";"As do I."
"204987124-0-54295";"I wish you the best."
"204987124-0-54296";"And what does the curse do?"
"204987124-0-54297";"Why would Margus Derius want to destroy Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54298";"Were you born in Cyrodiil?"
"204987124-0-54300";"What's a vakka stone, exactly?"
"204987124-0-54301";"What do you think it contains?"
"204987124-0-54302";"What brought you out here to Alten Meerhleel?"
"204987124-0-54303";"Why did Kassandra hire that bodyguard? Whiptail, right?"
"204987124-0-54304";"Why did Kassandra hire that bodyguard? Whiptail, right?"
"204987124-0-54305";"Famia is holding the Remnant, but it's taking a toll on her. She wants you to meet her at the tree."
"204987124-0-54308";"I don't think the curse was released, but the ritual did reveal the skull's hiding place."
"204987124-0-54310";"Here's the golden skull. You should take it for safekeeping."
"204987124-0-54313";"She's waiting for us beneath the tree."
"204987124-0-54315";"Who are the Black-Tongues?"
"204987124-0-54316";"Tell me about the Root-House people."
"204987124-0-54317";"Who are the Black-Tongues?"
"204987124-0-54318";"Any ideas on what this means? ""Inside an eye that never sees."""
"204987124-0-54319";"Who are the Black-Tongues?"
"204987124-0-54320";"Try me."
"204987124-0-54321";"Tell me about the Glade of Chimes."
"204987124-0-54322";"What does it have to do with your Hist?"
"204987124-0-54323";"Maybe so. What can you tell me about the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-54324";"Fair enough. What can you tell me about the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-54326";"Ruxol the Infirm?"
"204987124-0-54327";"So these suitors are marrying into your tribe?"
"204987124-0-54328";"Do all the Murkmire tribes participate in your bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-54329";"If you're safe here, why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-54330";"Prepare them how?"
"204987124-0-54332";"A guide? Like Xukas or Jaxsik-Orrn?"
"204987124-0-54333";"What's special about Leviathan Pizzle?"
"204987124-0-54334";"Tell me about your tribe."
"204987124-0-54335";"Most would call that stealing."
"204987124-0-54336";"Do the Root-House people dwell nearby?"
"204987124-0-54337";"You burned down Bright-Throat Village?"
"204987124-0-54338";"You really feel ready for this?"
"204987124-0-54339";"Do you always have to steal things?"
"204987124-0-54340";"And the Bright-Throats welcomed you back?"
"204987124-0-54342";"Do you think Jaxsik-Orrn will approve of you making this sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-54343";"What can you tell me about the Moss-Skins?"
"204987124-0-54344";"The weapon, but not the soul, right?"
"204987124-0-54345";"You just follow the path of least resistance?"
"204987124-0-54346";"A massive pool of evil slime that creates extensions of itself, got it."
"204987124-0-54348";"And you think we can fashion a ladder out of it?"
"204987124-0-54350";"The Bright-Throat tribe?"
"204987124-0-54351";"Sorry, what is a Saxhleel?"
"204987124-0-54352";"How can someone appreciate your culture too much?"
"204987124-0-54353";"You don't think these relics are worth recovering? Aren't they part of our history?"
"204987124-0-54354";"Rumors? Are you a spy of some kind?"
"204987124-0-54356";"I need to think about this."
"204987124-0-54357";"You only gave me your name. Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-54358";"Leave the waking world? Does that mean they'll die?"
"204987124-0-54359";"Any other secrets hiding in your egg-family's history?"
"204987124-0-54360";"And Xukas?"
"204987124-0-54361";"Don't despair. He chose to stay behind so he could guide the tribe back to the Hist. He was happy."
"204987124-0-54364";"What about Jaxsik-Orrn?"
"204987124-0-54366";"She chose to stay behind so she could guide the tribe back to the Hist. She was happy."
"204987124-0-54372";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-54373";"And he grew up to be a hero?"
"204987124-0-54374";"What did he do with these stakes?"
"204987124-0-54378";"Worse how?"
"204987124-0-54379";"Are you one of the custodians of the Teeth?"
"204987124-0-54380";"I'll tell Kassandra what we discovered."
"204987124-0-54381";"How so?"
"204987124-0-54387";"Are you sure these locations will be enough?"
"204987124-0-54389";"What do you mean, ""too sought out""?"
"204987124-0-54396";"What about the gauntlet?"
"204987124-0-54397";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-54398";"I'll stop her."
"204987124-0-54399";"You really think her ritual is that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-54400";"So the calendar can change the weather?"
"204987124-0-54401";"I was the one who found the tablets."
"204987124-0-54402";"What was she trying to do?"
"204987124-0-54403";"Where can I find these items?"
"204987124-0-54404";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-54405";"Is destroying altars to Sithis a good idea?"
"204987124-0-54406";"You believe she's capable of that?"
"204987124-0-54407";"Still, if she's been around as long as you say, I wouldn't expect to see so many from one group."
"204987124-0-54408";"I'm here now. Between the two of us, we should be able to make it through."
"204987124-0-54409";"What is Kassandra thinking?"
"204987124-0-54410";"What kind of issues?"
"204987124-0-54413";"Is destroying altars to Sithis a good idea?"
"204987124-0-54414";"I didn't expect to find a Wood Elf tending to an Argonian Temple. That's all."
"204987124-0-54416";"How did you come to be here?"
"204987124-0-54417";"And that brought you to Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54418";"You believe your captors are vampires?"
"204987124-0-54419";"Any idea what happened to him?"
"204987124-0-54425";"You think some misfortune is about to befall the ceremony?"
"204987124-0-54427";"I'd like to help. What is it you need?"
"204987124-0-54428";"Do you think she resents having to take care of other people's children?"
"204987124-0-54430";"I thought I saw you when I arrived, the commotion over the dead stranger."
"204987124-0-54431";"Has there been anything else strange going on around here?"
"204987124-0-54434";"The tree-minder believes there's something wrong with the eggs. They're suffering."
"204987124-0-54435";"Nisswo Paraxeeh?"
"204987124-0-54436";"The ones that survive?"
"204987124-0-54437";"Has the trial changed in some way to account for all those deaths?"
"204987124-0-54439";"If Kishi saved your lives, why punish him for that?"
"204987124-0-54440";"Daedric Anchors?"
"204987124-0-54442";"All right, I'll join the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-54443";"You really think your ancestor led the Ninth Legion here on purpose?"
"204987124-0-54445";"What's wrong with her? She seems distressed."
"204987124-0-54446";"What can you tell me about this dreaming tree?"
"204987124-0-54447";"Can she travel? We need to keep moving."
"204987124-0-54448";"You used to be a female?"
"204987124-0-54449";"So why didn't you bond with Kud-Nakal before?"
"204987124-0-54451";"So you ran away."
"204987124-0-54455";"Look for yourself. She was definitely here and definitely involved with the Veeskhleel."
"204987124-0-54457";"What about Haxara?"
"204987124-0-54459";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-54461";"All right. Famia and I will end this."
"204987124-0-54462";"There's no way I can change your mind? I could use your help."
"204987124-0-54464";"What are you and Varona doing in Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54465";"What is Bok-Xul?"
"204987124-0-54466";"What are you hoping to find inside the caverns?"
"204987124-0-54467";"Could all the activity affect the eggs?"
"204987124-0-54468";"I found this plant mixed in with the fruit. Is it supposed to be there?"
"204987124-0-54469";"What happens to them?"
"204987124-0-54470";"Why haven't I seen any Bright-Throats with the markings of the other tribes?"
"204987124-0-54473";"I bet. Now, what can you tell me about this xanmeer pyramid?"
"204987124-0-54474";"How long have you lived here in Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54475";"How long have you lived here in Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-54476";"Can a necromancer really be killed?"
"204987124-0-54478";"What's special about this crystal?"
"204987124-0-54479";"The Remnant of Argon? What's that?"
"204987124-0-54481";"All right, I'll meet with Xukas and find out what he knows. Where can I find him?"
"204987124-0-54484";"And the locals don't mind?"
"204987124-0-54485";"Will we find anything else inside the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-54486";"Sure. Now, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-54487";"How did that go?"
"204987124-0-54488";"The Wasseek-Haleel? Who are they?"
"204987124-0-54489";"Thanks for the advice. Now, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-54490";"Thanks for the advice. Any tribes I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-54491";"And the roots are in Bok-Xul?"
"204987124-0-54492";"Tell me more about the necromancer, Baxilt-Gah."
"204987124-0-54497";"What do you know about the Tsofeer Caverns?"
"204987124-0-54498";"It's worth checking out. Whoever gathered the dragonthorn may have left something behind."
"204987124-0-54499";"All right. I'll head to the glade myself."
"204987124-0-54500";"Tell me more about your ancestor."
"204987124-0-54501";"What happens if we can't bind the Wuju-Ka?"
"204987124-0-54504";"What can you tell me about the Blackguards?"
"204987124-0-54506";"They steal the dead?"
"204987124-0-54508";"So will this clear the traitor's mark from your egg-family?"
"204987124-0-54509";"Varo asked me to recover some tablets from the Teeth of Sithis."
"204987124-0-54510";"Varo asked me to recover some tablets from the Teeth of Sithis."
"204987124-0-54511";"What should I expect to encounter at the Teeth of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-54513";"So these bone weapons hold the spirits of your dead tribe members?"
"204987124-0-54514";"Tell me more about the necromancer, Baxilt-Gah."
"204987124-0-54515";"And he made a deal with you."
"204987124-0-54516";"What can you tell me about Blackrose Prison?"
"204987124-0-54517";"What are miregaunts?"
"204987124-0-54518";"Famia is looking for a treasure called the Kajin-Jat Crystal."
"204987124-0-54521";"That's fair. Did you learn anything about Seeks-the-Dark?"
"204987124-0-54522";"So Seeks-the-Dark left the Blackguards?"
"204987124-0-54523";"Tell me about the champion."
"204987124-0-54524";"Fine. What can you tell me about the Hall of Beasts?"
"204987124-0-54525";"So Sithis lets Drakeeh control the dead?"
"204987124-0-54526";"Maybe they want to punish him by putting you in danger."
"204987124-0-54527";"What can I expect from her?"
"204987124-0-54528";"So you think he failed to steal something for them?"
"204987124-0-54529";"Why were you a Blackguard?"
"204987124-0-54530";"A book she's writing?"
"204987124-0-54534";"What kind of scrolls am I looking for exactly?"
"204987124-0-54535";"Your Hist?"
"204987124-0-54536";"Sorry, what is a Saxhleel?"
"204987124-0-54540";"And you're all right asking me to kill it?"
"204987124-0-54541";"Tell me about your tribe."
"204987124-0-54542";"Shunatei?"
"204987124-0-54543";"Nothing lasts forever."
"204987124-0-54544";"Do you often give these crystals to Famia?"
"204987124-0-54545";"What if you can't?"
"204987124-0-54546";"You gave me your name, but who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-54547";"Where can I find the Argonian antiquities."
"204987124-0-54549";"Why don't you think the Argonian antiquities are valuable?"
"204987124-0-54551";"Does your tribe usually seek help from outsiders?"
"204987124-0-54553";"How will burning the Blackguards' supply caches help?"
"204987124-0-54555";"Does your tribe usually seek help from outsiders?"
"204987124-0-54559";"Don't the Blackguards hate Imperials?"
"204987124-0-54560";"How did Seeks-the-Dark end up captured?"
"204987124-0-54561";"Who is Fat Gixthi?"
"204987124-0-54562";"Why am I hunting her?"
"204987124-0-54563";"My name's not Mateem. It's <<1>>."
"204987124-0-54564";"My name's not Mateem. It's <<1>>."
"204987124-0-54565";"Did you prevail?"
"204987124-0-54568";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-54570";"But I just killed him, right?"
"204987124-0-54571";"If novices keep dying, why is Mewah-Jez permitted to remain the war-teacher?"
"204987124-0-54572";"Why is that bad?"
"204987124-0-54573";"What's so important about your staff?"
"204987124-0-54574";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54575";"So no one else in the village realizes that Mewah-Jez is the real problem?"
"204987124-0-54577";"How can it possibly be both and neither?"
"204987124-0-54578";"How do I use the fire stones to find Kishi?"
"204987124-0-54579";"So the war-chief is just going to let your tribe die out?"
"204987124-0-54580";"What did I just witness?"
"204987124-0-54581";"I think it is a dream-wallow vision."
"204987124-0-54582";"I'm not sure I understand, but thank you for the explanation."
"204987124-0-54583";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-54584";"I don't know."
"204987124-0-54585";"Sounds dangerous. Think you can help somehow?"
"204987124-0-54586";"Anything I should keep an eye out for?"
"204987124-0-54587";"Do you believe Xukas heard something outside?"
"204987124-0-54588";"Do you believe Xukas heard something outside?"
"204987124-0-54589";"Learn anything new about Seeks-the-Dark?"
"204987124-0-54592";"All right. Tell me about the Vampire's Pen."
"204987124-0-54595";"Can you tell me more about these seasons?"
"204987124-0-54597";"What kind of magic?"
"204987124-0-54601";"What can I expect in the next fight?"
"204987124-0-54606";"How do I use the fire stones to find Kishi?"
"204987124-0-54609";"What did you experience in your dream-wallow?"
"204987124-0-54610";"Do you know anything about the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-0-54611";"Is something else bothering you?"
"204987124-0-54613";"Kaju dream-beast?"
"204987124-0-54614";"What can you tell me about the dream-wallow?"
"204987124-0-54616";"Do you know much about the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-0-54617";"Do you know anything about the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-0-54618";"You're coming with us?"
"204987124-0-54619";"I'll go and collect the ingredients."
"204987124-0-54620";"How so?"
"204987124-0-54621";"Right. Learn anything else new?"
"204987124-0-54623";"And after I gather these items?"
"204987124-0-54625";"A similar task?"
"204987124-0-54631";"Let's focus on the gauntlet for now. What can you tell me about Drakeeh?"
"204987124-0-54632";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-54633";"I'll help you with the ritual."
"204987124-0-54634";"What do the local laws say?"
"204987124-0-54635";"Why were you asked to arbitrate this dispute?"
"204987124-0-54636";"It seems to me you would be on Paheiza's side, given she was your former boss."
"204987124-0-54637";"Tell me about Sulahkeesh of the Shadowscales."
"204987124-0-54638";"A former assassin helps arbitrate disputes?"
"204987124-0-54639";"So it's common for the Shadowscales to judge disputes?"
"204987124-0-54640";"Be your eyes? How so?"
"204987124-0-54642";"I'll speak to the claimants and search the farm."
"204987124-0-54643";"Yes. He wants your help to judge a dispute between Nurhei and Paheiza over a saltrice farm."
"204987124-0-54645";"Agreed. Hail Sithis."
"204987124-0-54646";"Tell more about the Shadowscales."
"204987124-0-54647";"So that's why you're asked to judge disputes."
"204987124-0-54648";"Needed change?"
"204987124-0-54649";"I don't know. Fifty, sixty?"
"204987124-0-54650";"Tell more about the Shadowscales."
"204987124-0-54651";"Tell more about the Shadowscales."
"204987124-0-54652";"There's something living in the caves here?"
"204987124-0-54653";"So you think we'll find the other half of the tablet here?"
"204987124-0-54654";"So the undead are still there?"
"204987124-0-54655";"I'd like to know who I'll be working with."
"204987124-0-54656";"Haxara, these can't be your children. They look almost fully grown."
"204987124-0-54657";"There's something living in the caves here?"
"204987124-0-54658";"I can go and check."
"204987124-0-54660";"Iskenaaz and I will look around, try to understand what Ree-Nekal is doing here."
"204987124-0-54661";"I don't believe that you came out here without any idea what you'd find."
"204987124-0-54662";"Tell me more about these debts."
"204987124-0-54663";"Why haven't you returned?"
"204987124-0-54664";"And what do you think of outsiders?"
"204987124-0-54666";"Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-54667";"Why did the Blackguards target you?"
"204987124-0-54668";"Why choose to come back to Murkmire, if there was such a risk?"
"204987124-0-54669";"You don't seem very grateful for the rescue."
"204987124-0-54670";"How much do you know about this Wrathstone?"
"204987124-0-54672";"We should get to know each other better then."
"204987124-0-54673";"What have you been doing since we last crossed paths?"
"204987124-0-54674";"Was that so hard?"
"204987124-0-54675";"Did Keema-Ru ever formally say you were to inherit the farm?"
"204987124-0-54676";"Keema-Ru's grave-stake?"
"204987124-0-54679";"What did Chukala do?"
"204987124-0-54682";"And that embarrassed Bhoki?"
"204987124-0-54683";"Will the war-chief really let an outsider attempt to walk the Path of the Lily?"
"204987124-0-54684";"That doesn't change the fact that I'm not a member of the tribe."
"204987124-0-54685";"I don't understand why Mewah-Jez replaced Bhoki as the war-teacher."
"204987124-0-54686";"You mentioned being a Goblin expert."
"204987124-0-54687";"So, because you're now male, you can't bond with Kud-Nakal?"
"204987124-0-54688";"So, because you're now male, you can't bond with Kud-Nakal?"
"204987124-0-54689";"What does a bonding ceremony entail?"
"204987124-0-54690";"What can you tell me about the Goblins here?"
"204987124-0-54692";"What sort of arrangement?"
"204987124-0-54693";"All right, I'll get this hunting bow for you."
"204987124-0-54694";"Nurhei was the one selling Paheiza skooma. Both sisters owed him for loans."
"204987124-0-54695";"Has this helped you with your decision?"
"204987124-0-54697";"Why do I need to give them oils?"
"204987124-0-54699";"There must have been another way."
"204987124-0-54700";"What are miregaunts?"
"204987124-0-54701";"It's part of a Shadowscale negotiating ceremony."
"204987124-0-54703";"Here's the oil."
"204987124-0-54704";"Specifically about how you supplied Paheiza with skooma, and then indebted both sisters."
"204987124-0-54706";"Powerful magic?"
"204987124-0-54708";"She wants you to rub this oil into your scales before you attend."
"204987124-0-54709";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-54710";"And so you stole from your sister to keep up the habit."
"204987124-0-54713";"You don't deserve your sister's land. You're the reason she went into ruin."
"204987124-0-54716";"Do you have any advice?"
"204987124-0-54717";"I will see that he does. What happens now?"
"204987124-0-54718";"I will see that she does. What happens now?"
"204987124-0-54719";"I think Jaxsik-Orrn should guide your tribe to lives of courage and commitment. [Jaxsik-Orrn Dies]"
"204987124-0-54721";"Why do you want to bury it?"
"204987124-0-54722";"I see."
"204987124-0-54723";"Where did you go?"
"204987124-0-54724";"It's probably best I know what's in the box."
"204987124-0-54725";"Nothing."
"204987124-0-54726";"So you're going to create art from the rubble?"
"204987124-0-54727";"Does Mewah-Jez aid her novices the way you're helping me?"
"204987124-0-54730";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54732";"It doesn't look like these curses stopped the Blackguards."
"204987124-0-54733";"Well, she always said the Hist wouldn't speak to her. Do you think the staff could be resisting her?"
"204987124-0-54734";"Don't be too hard on yourself. We'll stop her together."
"204987124-0-54736";"All right. Where is this tree?"
"204987124-0-54739";"So we're trying to reach that village."
"204987124-0-54743";"Right. She said it would guide me to the seed—the Remnant. But we lost it to Kassandra."
"204987124-0-54745";"Where is Famia? Did she leave with Kassandra?"
"204987124-0-54746";"Where is Famia? Did she leave with Kassandra?"
"204987124-0-54747";"And what about Whiptail?"
"204987124-0-54748";"Can we talk about what happened in the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-0-54749";"What do you think she'll do with the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-54750";"What can you tell me about the Deepmire?"
"204987124-0-54751";"It looks familiar."
"204987124-0-54752";"What is Kassandra thinking?"
"204987124-0-54754";"Good luck, Kishi."
"204987124-0-54755";"And if I asked for your mercy?"
"204987124-0-54758";"Why do the Argonians worship Sithis?"
"204987124-0-54760";"And how does one choose a partner?"
"204987124-0-54761";"And yourself? Why do you want to bond with Kud-Nakal?"
"204987124-0-54763";"No, but you can stop it. That will have to be enough."
"204987124-0-54767";"So why didn't you bond with Kud-Nakal before?"
"204987124-0-54768";"What if the killer is one of the Dead-Water?"
"204987124-0-54769";"Why come to me for this? Don't the tribes have ways of dealing with this kind of crime?"
"204987124-0-54770";"Even if you stay, there's no guarantee that your daughter will change for the better."
"204987124-0-54772";"What do you propose we do with them?"
"204987124-0-54773";"I was told he was still alive when you found him. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-54774";"What if I decide she should stay?"
"204987124-0-54775";"Any idea what he was trying to tell you?"
"204987124-0-54776";"Bad things?"
"204987124-0-54777";"Does your tribe usually seek help from outsiders?"
"204987124-0-54778";"I was told you found one of the Skin Taker's victims."
"204987124-0-54779";"Someone got the better of the Skin Taker?"
"204987124-0-54780";"So the killer's a woman? Did you get a good look at her?"
"204987124-0-54782";"Where did you encounter the killer?"
"204987124-0-54783";"Where did you encounter the killer?"
"204987124-0-54784";"Where did you encounter the killer?"
"204987124-0-54785";"You still haven't explained what you want the jellies for. I'm not catching your dinner, am I?"
"204987124-0-54786";"How'd you end up like this?"
"204987124-0-54789";"I'll find her."
"204987124-0-54790";"Where is Hostia now?"
"204987124-0-54791";"And I just have to get them with the net? They aren't dangerous or anything, are they?"
"204987124-0-54792";"Is there anything I can do for you?"
"204987124-0-54793";"I'm sorry. I'm getting the jellies and you're doing what again?"
"204987124-0-54796";"What's your plan here?"
"204987124-0-54797";"Will there be more Blackguards waiting for me at this hideout?"
"204987124-0-54801";"Complete your journey?"
"204987124-0-54803";"You want me to plant the grave-stake in this glade?"
"204987124-0-54804";"This machine is huge. What do you think it was for?"
"204987124-0-54805";"Why destroy it so quickly, though?"
"204987124-0-54807";"I'll plant Tun-Zee's grave-stake in the glade."
"204987124-0-54808";"My thoughts exactly."
"204987124-0-54809";"How did you come up with this idea anyway?"
"204987124-0-54810";"How did you come up with this idea anyway?"
"204987124-0-54814";"Can you tell me more about the local laws?"
"204987124-0-54816";"What's a grave-singer?"
"204987124-0-54817";"What's the purpose of these grave-stakes?"
"204987124-0-54818";"So you help place the grave-stakes where they belong?"
"204987124-0-54819";"How was his grave-stake stolen?"
"204987124-0-54820";"What exactly is a grave-stake?"
"204987124-0-54821";"Is that how you became injured?"
"204987124-0-54823";"Can you tell me more about why that tree grew?"
"204987124-0-54824";"You don't sound like the other Argonians I've spoken to here in Murkmire."
"204987124-0-54825";"Are lukiuls treated differently here?"
"204987124-0-54826";"She was a Blackguard who turned slaver after her husband was executed by an Argonian tribe."
"204987124-0-54828";"If I hadn't asked the Dead-Water to spare her, these killings would have never happened."
"204987124-0-54829";"The Skin Taker had no kin left."
"204987124-0-54830";"That doesn't sound so bad."
"204987124-0-54834";"These killings were in retaliation for Jaxsik executing her mother."
"204987124-0-54835";"Tell me about the necromancer, Baxilt-Gah."
"204987124-0-54836";"So what does the necromancer get out of stealing these grave-stakes?"
"204987124-0-54837";"Then why are you asking me for help?"
"204987124-0-54838";"What is Bok-Xul?"
"204987124-0-54839";"And what tribe do you represent?"
"204987124-0-54841";"Where can I find Oleen?"
"204987124-0-54842";"Why would he write reminders about reminders?"
"204987124-0-54844";"Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-54845";"What are your thoughts on the matter?"
"204987124-0-54847";"Who's Naheesh Oleen?"
"204987124-0-54848";"Explain to me how I'm supposed to find the dowry again."
"204987124-0-54855";"What did you call yourself before? Voh-Vastei?"
"204987124-0-54856";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54857";"What are some of the other uses?"
"204987124-0-54858";"You've never see this before?"
"204987124-0-54859";"Is egg-tending that demanding?"
"204987124-0-54860";"It has nothing to do with the Remnant of Argon?"
"204987124-0-54862";"Fair enough. Why can't you sneak into the depot with me? You just pick-pocketed that Orc."
"204987124-0-54863";"Any tips on infiltrating the depot?"
"204987124-0-54864";"Why are you helping us?"
"204987124-0-54865";"I think we should move on."
"204987124-0-54869";"Is that safe?"
"204987124-0-54870";"Why did they take Kishi to the ruins?"
"204987124-0-54872";"Best of luck."
"204987124-0-54873";"You want me to save Kishi and then send him away?"
"204987124-0-54874";"So even if she's your friend, we should still be wary?"
"204987124-0-54875";"What's your next step?"
"204987124-0-54876";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-54878";"Best of luck."
"204987124-0-54879";"About that. Why do you think the Wrathstone isn't Dwemer?"
"204987124-0-54880";"I see. Speaking of seeing, how did you lose your sight?"
"204987124-0-54883";"Could Paheiza not pay back those debts after she inherits the farm?"
"204987124-0-54887";"Thanks for the information. We should get going."
"204987124-0-54894";"I'll do so. Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-54899";"That one's lost nearly all its scales. It had to have left them somewhere."
"204987124-0-54900";"Why weren't you as close to your tribe?"
"204987124-0-54906";"Where would I find the Tree-Minder?"
"204987124-0-54908";"So, your weapon talks to you?"
"204987124-0-54911";"What's so special about the temple?"
"204987124-0-54912";"What about now? Can you become the tree-minder of this Hist?"
"204987124-0-54913";"No questions from me. Let's start smashing things."
"204987124-0-54914";"Your name is pretty much all I know."
"204987124-0-54915";"No questions from me. Let's start smashing things."
"204987124-0-54916";"Xukas told me the two of you are friends."
"204987124-0-54917";"Do they often kidnap members of your tribe?"
"204987124-0-54918";"And what happens at the ritual of renewal?"
"204987124-0-54919";"A price?"
"204987124-0-54921";"I'll accompany Stibbons to the Swallowed Grove."
"204987124-0-54922";"No more questions from me. Let's start the raid."
"204987124-0-54923";"Raj-Kaal Seelan?"
"204987124-0-54924";"So you lied to her."
"204987124-0-54928";"Unless you want to become a fine pair of boots, I'd be a little more friendly if I were you."
"204987124-0-54930";"Why didn't you just sell the charm to Lady Laurent in the first place?"
"204987124-0-54931";"Who is this Tsojei person you keep talking about?"
"204987124-0-54933";"The Veeskhleel?"
"204987124-0-54936";"I'll get the key for you."
"204987124-0-54938";"I'll take the renewal charm to Lady Laurent."
"204987124-0-54939";"What do you want to trade for a renewal charm?"
"204987124-0-54940";"I'll take the renewal charm to Lady Laurent."
"204987124-0-54942";"What's the significance of your old training manual?"
"204987124-0-54943";"Days of Stone-Nests?"
"204987124-0-54944";"All right. Now, why would the thief leave a book of riddles?"
"204987124-0-54945";"The northern section of the village is in ruins?"
"204987124-0-54946";"Why is the northern part of your town in ruins?"
"204987124-0-54947";"Why is the northern part of your town in ruins?"
"204987124-0-54948";"I see. Tell me more about this calendar."
"204987124-0-54949";"If you were born a slave, how did you earn this fortune?"
"204987124-0-54950";"So you're a treasure hunter?"
"204987124-0-54951";"Jaxsik-Orrn and Xukas seem convinced that the Remnant is here."
"204987124-0-54952";"What kind of preparations?"
"204987124-0-54953";"And that would allow one of us to participate in the ritual of renewal?"
"204987124-0-54955";"I'll inform Lady Laurent."
"204987124-0-54956";"What is this bonding ritual exactly?"
"204987124-0-54957";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-54959";"Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-54963";"What would the Blackguards want with envoys?"
"204987124-0-54968";"What did the Bright-Throats offer?"
"204987124-0-54969";"Do you plan to use it for something?"
"204987124-0-54970";"Kassandra is an unusual name for an Argonian."
"204987124-0-54971";"Has moving to Murkmire helped?"
"204987124-0-54972";"Kassandra is an unusual name for an Argonian."
"204987124-0-54973";"Is that the Kajin-Jat Crystal behind you?"
"204987124-0-54974";"Has moving here to Murkmire helped?"
"204987124-0-54975";"Thanks. If you were born a slave, how did you earn this fortune?"
"204987124-0-54976";"Any advice hunting hackwings?"
"204987124-0-54977";"Happy frogs?"
"204987124-0-54979";"Where do I find the frogs you need?"
"204987124-0-54980";"Tell me about the other frogs."
"204987124-0-54981";"I don't understand what the frogs have to do with a musical instrument."
"204987124-0-54982";"What about the third frog?"
"204987124-0-54983";"I don't understand what the frogs have to do with a musical instrument."
"204987124-0-54984";"And the final frog you need?"
"204987124-0-54987";"Like political marriages?"
"204987124-0-54988";"Why are you so worried about this particular tree?"
"204987124-0-54990";"And why is that important?"
"204987124-0-54991";"And Tree-Minder Pavu oversees this bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-54993";"Why didn't you admit your feelings?"
"204987124-0-54999";"What's Stibbons doing in the mud again?"
"204987124-0-55000";"What's the ritual of renewal?"
"204987124-0-55001";"It's good to see you again, Stibbons."
"204987124-0-55002";"And that's bad?"
"204987124-0-55003";"You don't trust Many-Whispers?"
"204987124-0-55005";"If his first tip didn't pan out, why go back to him?"
"204987124-0-55007";"What brings you to this cavern full of undead creatures?"
"204987124-0-55008";"What's so special about a renewal charm?"
"204987124-0-55009";"There must be something you can tell me about it."
"204987124-0-55010";"Can you tell me about the preparations again?"
"204987124-0-55011";"How does one align their blood?"
"204987124-0-55012";"How does one align their bile?"
"204987124-0-55013";"How does one align their blood?"
"204987124-0-55014";"How does one align their blood?"
"204987124-0-55019";"You'll find I'm very strong."
"204987124-0-55020";"How did someone like you wind up as Kassandra's bodyguard?"
"204987124-0-55021";"What exactly do you do for Kassandra?"
"204987124-0-55022";"Surely the same would be true of one of your tribe."
"204987124-0-55023";"Can Stibbons be turned back into your manservant?"
"204987124-0-55024";"What do you expect me to find?"
"204987124-0-55025";"What are those ties, exactly?"
"204987124-0-55026";"If your eggs are in danger, why not cancel your ceremony?"
"204987124-0-55028";"What do you expect me to find?"
"204987124-0-55029";"If it can tell you this much, why can't the Hist tell you what's wrong?"
"204987124-0-55030";"Why entrust me with this task?"
"204987124-0-55031";"Which tribes have sent suitors this year?"
"204987124-0-55032";"You think some misfortune is about to befall the ceremony?"
"204987124-0-55034";"They sound like thugs. Why invite them?"
"204987124-0-55035";"So they're pacifists?"
"204987124-0-55036";"What can you tell me about the Root-House people?"
"204987124-0-55037";"Do they frighten you?"
"204987124-0-55038";"Fair enough. Now, who are the Black-Tongues?"
"204987124-0-55039";"Where do you think I should start my search?"
"204987124-0-55041";"Was it an Argonian?"
"204987124-0-55042";"Interesting. Now what can you tell me about the Root-House people?"
"204987124-0-55043";"What is this bonding ritual, exactly? A wedding?"
"204987124-0-55044";"Where do you think I should start my search?"
"204987124-0-55045";"You worry that it's contagious."
"204987124-0-55046";"I see. And the other suitors?"
"204987124-0-55049";"All right, thanks for sharing."
"204987124-0-55052";"Does bonding with other tribes ever go badly?"
"204987124-0-55053";"Tell me about the Ritual of Change."
"204987124-0-55055";"I see. Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-0-55056";"If Kishi saved your lives, why punish him for that?"
"204987124-0-55057";"Actually, it was the tree-minder. Something is upsetting the Hist. She said the eggs are suffering."
"204987124-0-55059";"What about the empty nest beds?"
"204987124-0-55066";"Agreed. Let's go."
"204987124-0-55067";"So there's been nothing abnormal, nothing at all?"
"204987124-0-55069";"I'll let you get back to your work."
"204987124-0-55070";"Is that why Kishi intervened to save you?"
"204987124-0-55072";"Wait—"
"204987124-0-55074";"My condolences."
"204987124-0-55076";"Have you never belonged to another tribe?"
"204987124-0-55079";"You stole the bow from your bonding partner?"
"204987124-0-55084";"All right. I'll bury the branch at the roots of the Hist."
"204987124-0-55089";"Why did you decide to return?"
"204987124-0-55091";"I see. I'll go and speak to the Root-House people."
"204987124-0-55092";"I want to help. No one should be sentenced to death for saving lives."
"204987124-0-55094";"Who's Uraz?"
"204987124-0-55095";"So the act of creation honors Sithis?"
"204987124-0-55096";"Tell me about your role as nisswo."
"204987124-0-55098";"What did you mean when you said you didn't know what the Hist's relief meant for Haxara's daughter?"
"204987124-0-55100";"I'll collect your hammer."
"204987124-0-55103";"And that's why you had me destroy the monument?"
"204987124-0-55104";"And then?"
"204987124-0-55106";"You don't all speak the same words?"
"204987124-0-55107";"Meaning …?"
"204987124-0-55108";"How do you become a nisswo?"
"204987124-0-55109";"Offerings of blood?"
"204987124-0-55110";"Why travel? Why not stay in one village?"
"204987124-0-55111";"So the priests of Sithis all believe different things?"
"204987124-0-55112";"Seems like a complicated way to spread a religion."
"204987124-0-55115";"All right, we'll go meet up with your associates and gather these stones."
"204987124-0-55116";"Tell me about Tun-Zee."
"204987124-0-55118";"How so?"
"204987124-0-55119";"What do you make of this green liquid?"
"204987124-0-55120";"What about stopping the Veeskhleel?"
"204987124-0-55121";"All right. Let's find Chime-Maker Shuvu in the Glade of Chimes."
"204987124-0-55122";"So, I need a specific chime? One that speaks about the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-55123";"Where is this chime?"
"204987124-0-55125";"All right. I'll recover the chime from the Wither-Vault."
"204987124-0-55126";"I'm just trying to understand."
"204987124-0-55127";"Was taking the eggs really necessary?"
"204987124-0-55128";"Have you talked to the Tree-Minder about it?"
"204987124-0-55129";"I'll hang the chime."
"204987124-0-55131";"I'll do that. Thanks for your time."
"204987124-0-55132";"Why can't you tell me more?"
"204987124-0-55133";"Now that the stake is placed, what will you do now?"
"204987124-0-55134";"So you're unsure what happened?"
"204987124-0-55135";"Let's say it is an outsider. Who would you suspect?"
"204987124-0-55137";"We're going to meet with a member of the Dead-Water tribe named Jaxsik-Orrn. Perhaps she can help."
"204987124-0-55138";"And then Mewah-Jez took over?"
"204987124-0-55140";"I'll keep that in mind. If you'll excuse me, Xukas is waiting. Farewell."
"204987124-0-55141";"Why do you feel you're safe among the Dead-Water tribe?"
"204987124-0-55144";"I'm afraid not. They're escorting Kassandra somewhere. Jaxsik-Orrn couldn't catch up."
"204987124-0-55146";"I see. Why are you helping out now?"
"204987124-0-55148";"Do you know a healer named Hands-That-Heal? He may have belonged to your village."
"204987124-0-55150";"How'd he die?"
"204987124-0-55151";"All right, I'll look for anything related to the Remnant."
"204987124-0-55156";"Is there a way to use this arcane power?"
"204987124-0-55157";"Where can I find Sulosya?"
"204987124-0-55158";"We rang a special chime to commune with the Hist."
"204987124-0-55159";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-55160";"So you want me to talk to the Dead-Water tribe, find out what this relic could be?"
"204987124-0-55162";"All right. I'll travel to Dead-Water Village and find Jaxsik-Orrn."
"204987124-0-55163";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-55164";"She's lucky to have you."
"204987124-0-55165";"Have you decided on a name?"
"204987124-0-55167";"Would you say he knows his way around a knife?"
"204987124-0-55169";"It's too early to make any accusations. I'm just exploring all the possibilities."
"204987124-0-55171";"What's next for you then?"
"204987124-0-55172";"Maybe you should leave her alone."
"204987124-0-55175";"And if they can't, or won't?"
"204987124-0-55176";"All right, I'll retrieve the oils and give them to Nurhei and Paheiza."
"204987124-0-55177";"Fair enough. Be seeing you, Xukas."
"204987124-0-55180";"I see. Tell me more about this Remnant of Argon."
"204987124-0-55181";"How did they react?"
"204987124-0-55182";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-55183";"This Dead-Water tribe—they're hostile?"
"204987124-0-55184";"I can handle myself. Tell me."
"204987124-0-55185";"You don't seem impressed."
"204987124-0-55187";"If it's everywhere, how is it a secret?"
"204987124-0-55188";"Others what?"
"204987124-0-55189";"If it does exist, do you have any idea what it is?"
"204987124-0-55190";"Where did you last see her?"
"204987124-0-55192";"I'll find her."
"204987124-0-55193";"Then there must be a trail that leads there. I'll continue my search."
"204987124-0-55194";"Does an envoy really make you seem more important?"
"204987124-0-55195";"I worked with Captain Jimila in the past."
"204987124-0-55196";"I found this charm on her body."
"204987124-0-55200";"All right. I'll find someone else to help."
"204987124-0-55202";"Why use me as an envoy? Why not contact Captain Jimila directly?"
"204987124-0-55203";"Probably just a lifetime of practice."
"204987124-0-55204";"First, Nesh-Deeka wants you to have this vossa-satl as a gift and to display the depth of his skill."
"204987124-0-55205";"The vossa-satl is a musical instrument. Argonians in other lands would love a little sound of home."
"204987124-0-55206";"It's a sort of wind and keyboard instrument. It uses frogs to make its sounds."
"204987124-0-55208";"I'll let Nesh-Deeka know he has a deal."
"204987124-0-55210";"So, she made a poor deal."
"204987124-0-55211";"Why did you want old treaties?"
"204987124-0-55212";"Ojel? What's that?"
"204987124-0-55213";"Why can't you sneak into the depot with me? You just pick-pocketed that Orc."
"204987124-0-55214";"All right. So, back to the deal with Domitia. It went bad?"
"204987124-0-55215";"All right. So, back to the deal with Domitia. It went bad?"
"204987124-0-55216";"Tell me about the Dead-Water's gift."
"204987124-0-55217";"What did the Bright-Throats offer?"
"204987124-0-55218";"What did the Bright-Throats offer?"
"204987124-0-55219";"Who was the victim you found?"
"204987124-0-55221";"How are you recovering?"
"204987124-0-55222";"How are you recovering?"
"204987124-0-55224";"Yes, I helped him find the branch when it was lost. I also buried it."
"204987124-0-55225";"He's in the Bright-Throat Village if you want to see him."
"204987124-0-55226";"If you want to help, why not become this village's tree-minder?"
"204987124-0-55227";"But the last time I saw you, Stibbons wasn't doing so well."
"204987124-0-55228";"You seem tired. How long have you been waiting for them?"
"204987124-0-55231";"Where can I find Julitta?"
"204987124-0-55233";"Murdered? By the Skin Taker?"
"204987124-0-55234";"Hostia? The slaver I spared from execution?"
"204987124-0-55235";"What's Stibbons doing in the mud again?"
"204987124-0-55236";"Your traditions make you offensive?"
"204987124-0-55239";"Hostia, you said? I was there when she was put to death."
"204987124-0-55241";"Will there be more Blackguards waiting for me at this hideout?"
"204987124-0-55242";"Why was he put to death?"
"204987124-0-55243";"What are the bog-eels for?"
"204987124-0-55244";"How did you get past all the monsters?"
"204987124-0-55245";"Will there be more Blackguards waiting for me at this hideout?"
"204987124-0-55248";"What are you drinking?"
"204987124-0-55250";"So he refuses to give you back your coin purse?"
"204987124-0-55252";"So you sold Argonian relics to earn that gold?"
"204987124-0-55253";"Why did she change them?"
"204987124-0-55254";"You say she doesn't respect your culture, but you're not respecting hers. You should compromise."
"204987124-0-55255";"Or so you thought?"
"204987124-0-55256";"But that's stealing."
"204987124-0-55258";"And I've been provided many ways to kill you. Give the man back his gold."
"204987124-0-55259";"If the Blackguards are also harassing the Dead-Water tribe, maybe they'd agree to cooperate."
"204987124-0-55260";"If you want to tell Argonians tales, you should tell them in the Argonian way."
"204987124-0-55263";"And how are you doing?"
"204987124-0-55265";"Be well, Hands-That-Heal."
"204987124-0-55266";"Were you ever told the specifics of your accommodations?"
"204987124-0-55267";"I believe you can't stay with your tribe, but I don't wish you ill."
"204987124-0-55268";"So you've made peace with your mentor?"
"204987124-0-55271";"How is your daughter doing?"
"204987124-0-55273";"Stay safe, Vozei."
"204987124-0-55275";"Very well then. I suppose you'll just be left in this swamp then. All alone …."
"204987124-0-55276";"All right. Are you still staying in the Dead-Water Village?"
"204987124-0-55278";"Perhaps. Take care, Nisswo."
"204987124-0-55279";"Yes, it was worth it."
"204987124-0-55280";"Perhaps. Stay well, Sulahkeesh."
"204987124-0-55282";"Stay well, Sulahkeesh."
"204987124-0-55283";"I'll try to. Stay well, Sulahkeesh."
"204987124-0-55284";"Her demands?"
"204987124-0-55286";"Arguing with her isn't going to work. Just drop her off at Lilmoth and be done with it."
"204987124-0-55287";"Very well. Dread Father guide your blade."
"204987124-0-55295";"Reed hoops?"
"204987124-0-55297";"I could try to explain it to him."
"204987124-0-55298";"Why don't you just learn as you play?"
"204987124-0-55299";"I give the Dread Father his due."
"204987124-0-55305";"Hit the ball into the wall for one point. Lower hoop is three points. Upper hoop ends the game."
"204987124-0-55307";"Someone's coming."
"204987124-0-55308";"You don't seem thrilled to be in Murkmire."
"204987124-0-55309";"How is that going?"
"204987124-0-55311";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-55314";"I do accumulate a lot of junk in my travels."
"204987124-0-55319";"Worse how?"
"204987124-0-55320";"Where are you headed?"
"204987124-0-55322";"Why didn't he?"
"204987124-0-55328";"That bothers you?"
"204987124-0-55330";"Voh-vastei?"
"204987124-0-55333";"Ah, I see what you mean. I'll light the fire."
"204987124-0-55334";"So you're scaring your apprentice to teach him a lesson?"
"204987124-0-55337";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-55338";"""They?"" Don't you mean ""we?"" You're an Argonian, too."
"204987124-0-55339";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-55341";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-55343";"I don't think you're going to win this fight. Better to give up."
"204987124-0-55345";"That's very … poetic?"
"204987124-0-55346";"What are grave-stakes, exactly?"
"204987124-0-55347";"Do the dead often rise around here?"
"204987124-0-55348";"Are you concerned about the bog-blights attacking us?"
"204987124-0-55349";"So these grave-stakes pin down the dead—they keep them from rising?"
"204987124-0-55350";"And if I can't?"
"204987124-0-55352";"Go on. I'll stop Ree-Nakal."
"204987124-0-55353";"I won't stop you. Do you have any idea where Ree-Nakal could be keeping your children?"
"204987124-0-55354";"Do you know any way to counteract it?"
"204987124-0-55356";"You never suspected Ree-Nakal had bad intentions?"
"204987124-0-55357";"Was taking the eggs really necessary?"
"204987124-0-55358";"That story wasn't too bad."
"204987124-0-55359";"Did he win?"
"204987124-0-55361";"They sound dangerous, Haxara."
"204987124-0-55363";"Stay close."
"204987124-0-55364";"Is there any way to restore Stibbons to his usual self?"
"204987124-0-55366";"It might not be that simple."
"204987124-0-55367";"I'll escort you back to the village."
"204987124-0-55368";"You think they'll accept her?"
"204987124-0-55369";"What are the alternatives?"
"204987124-0-55370";"Meaning what?"
"204987124-0-55371";"How would you punish Haxara for what she's done?"
"204987124-0-55375";"We'll see, I guess."
"204987124-0-55377";"Good luck, Haxara."
"204987124-0-55378";"I'm not sure I understand."
"204987124-0-55380";"You mentioned a decision I would have to make."
"204987124-0-55381";"You mentioned a decision I would have to make."
"204987124-0-55382";"So his stories are too … gory?"
"204987124-0-55383";"Why does Varona have an interest in ancient stonework?"
"204987124-0-55384";"What are you and Varona doing in Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-55385";"What are you and Varona doing in Murkmire?"
"204987124-0-55386";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-55388";"Best of luck to you both."
"204987124-0-55390";"Could you explain the rules to me?"
"204987124-0-55391";"Sure, I've got time."
"204987124-0-55392";"Yes, I see your point. That is an important lesson to learn."
"204987124-0-55393";"What is this miracle? What does the Remnant do?"
"204987124-0-55394";"You keep calling me Rootmender. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-55395";"Is this a vision, or is it really happening?"
"204987124-0-55396";"Thanks for the advice."
"204987124-0-55397";"What can you tell me about the prison?"
"204987124-0-55398";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-55399";"Why do the Blackguards stay in an old prison?"
"204987124-0-55400";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-55401";"How can you be so sure about this?"
"204987124-0-55402";"How did you survive?"
"204987124-0-55403";"What is Kassandra thinking?"
"204987124-0-55404";"I have a couple of questions before I agree to gather these frogs."
"204987124-0-55406";"Do you know how it got there?"
"204987124-0-55408";"You're not at all curious how it got there?"
"204987124-0-55409";"What's the story with this wreck in the tree?"
"204987124-0-55410";"How'd it get here?"
"204987124-0-55411";"I guess that didn't go as planned."
"204987124-0-55412";"Vexillum?"
"204987124-0-55413";"What is the Refuge?"
"204987124-0-55414";"And you are one of the tenders you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-55416";"All right, I'll clear my mind."
"204987124-0-55418";"I will share everything I know, if you join us in Lilmoth."
"204987124-0-55419";"Do any other Murkmire tribes participate in your bonding ritual?"
"204987124-0-55421";"Take me to Vulkhel Guard in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-55426";"Sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-55427";"Who are the Black-Tongues?"
"204987124-0-55428";"So there's no Black-Tongue suitor? Could you replace him?"
"204987124-0-55429";"How many times was Ruxol chosen to be the Black-Tongue suitor?"
"204987124-0-55430";"Tell me about your tribe."
"204987124-0-55431";"Can't you just ask for the dowry? The Bright-Throats might be convinced to give it to you."
"204987124-0-55432";"What is a seed-doll exactly?"
"204987124-0-55433";"Is this your private viewing spot?"
"204987124-0-55435";"It is a nice view."
"204987124-0-55438";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-55439";"Limited?"
"204987124-0-55441";"So arbitration is more hands on, as it were."
"204987124-0-55442";"Where can I find the swamp jellies?"
"204987124-0-55443";"Where can I find the swamp jellies?"
"204987124-0-55445";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55446";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55447";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55448";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55449";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55450";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55451";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55452";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-0-55453";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55454";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55455";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-0-55456";"Are you always so cryptic?"
"204987124-0-55457";"So, you're an assassin."
"204987124-0-55458";"So, you're an assassin."
"204987124-0-55459";"You don't think the souls would fight back?"
"204987124-0-55462";"Thanks, I think."
"204987124-0-55463";"Where is Famia? Did she leave with Kassandra?"
"204987124-0-55464";"So you're here to give me fair warning?"
"204987124-0-55465";"So you're here to give me fair warning?"
"204987124-0-55469";"Any idea why they took over the Teeth of Sithis?"
"204987124-0-55470";"What can you tell me about Solni?"
"204987124-0-55471";"You're going to poison yourself?"
"204987124-0-55473";"Oh. Drink one for me then."
"204987124-0-55475";"Best of luck to you."
"204987124-0-55476";"I will never see them again, will I?"
"204987124-0-55477";"Couldn't I guide the tribe? Why does it need to be Xukas or Jaxsik-Orrn?"
"204987124-0-55478";"You mentioned that one of my companions have to stay here. Why does one of them need to die?"
"204987124-0-55479";"Your Hist looks old and barren. Will releasing you from the Remnant bring it back to life?"
"204987124-0-55480";"Where do you think I should start my search?"
"204987124-0-55481";"I'd still like to talk to her."
"204987124-0-55482";"I found more dragonthorn in that empty egg bed."
"204987124-0-55483";"So I should come to you if I want to join a hunt?"
"204987124-0-55484";"Tell me about Varo."
"204987124-0-55485";"These deadly things you mentioned. They're monsters?"
"204987124-0-55487";"These deadly things you mentioned. They're monsters?"
"204987124-0-55491";"You should give the culture of your people a chance."
"204987124-0-55494";"Let's hear it."
"204987124-0-55496";"I accept."
"204987124-0-55497";"You mentioned that one of my companions have to stay here. Does one of them have to die?"
"204987124-0-55498";"Is this concept important to Argonians?"
"204987124-0-55500";"We defeated these Blackguards easily enough."
"204987124-0-55502";"Well, do you have a plan on how to find this queen?"
"204987124-0-55503";"You think you can kill them all?"
"204987124-0-55505";"What if we could find it first?"
"204987124-0-55506";"How long?"
"204987124-0-55507";"Tell me how to gather the sun-blessed toads."
"204987124-0-55511";"Who were you talking to when I arrived?"
"204987124-0-55513";"So you'll welcome outsiders?"
"204987124-0-55514";"The temples?"
"204987124-0-55515";"Pneumeria Chamber?"
"204987124-0-55516";"How are you talking to him if he is dead?"
"204987124-0-55517";"No, not at all."
"204987124-0-55518";"Is what possible?"
"204987124-0-55519";"Why do you describe Famia as persistent?"
"204987124-0-55520";"Do you really think Xukas can help find your missing friends?"
"204987124-0-55524";"Are your ancestors from Murkmire originally?"
"204987124-0-55525";"What do you plan to do with this Remnant of Argon if we find it?"
"204987124-0-55526";"Pneumeria Chamber?"
"204987124-0-55527";"Maybe this tribe knows something. Do you have any idea where they went?"
"204987124-0-55528";"What does a Grave-Singer do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-55530";"Grave-Stake?"
"204987124-0-55534";"Is it a temple of some kind?"
"204987124-0-55535";"If Kassandra doesn't stop, we might have to fight her. Are you prepared for that?"
"204987124-0-55536";"Garden?"
"204987124-0-55537";"What do you know about this Vakka-Bok Xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-55541";"Where can I pick up the trail?"
"204987124-0-55543";"Don't worry. I'll catch up to Jaxsik-Orrn."
"204987124-0-55545";"I'm surprised the flag survived out here."
"204987124-0-55546";"What's the vexillum you mention?"
"204987124-0-55547";"Why was a Dark Elf ship flying an Imperial banner?"
"204987124-0-55548";"And how did it wind up at the top of a tree?"
"204987124-0-55549";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-55551";"All right. Lets find the Remnant and finish this."
"204987124-0-55552";"How can we set them free?"
"204987124-0-55554";"All right, I'll go get Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn."
"204987124-0-55556";"How is your daughter doing?"
"204987124-0-55557";"I'm glad to see you're both well."
"204987124-0-55558";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-55560";"Is that why you're here? To admire me."
"204987124-0-55561";"Point taken."
"204987124-0-55563";"Until then."
"204987124-0-55564";"Is that why you're here? To catch up?"
"204987124-0-55565";"Point taken."
"204987124-0-55567";"Until then."
"204987124-0-55568";"Point taken."
"204987124-0-55570";"Until then."
"204987124-0-55571";"Point taken."
"204987124-0-55573";"Until then."
"204987124-0-55574";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-0-55575";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-0-55576";"Is Concordia here, too?"
"204987124-0-55577";"Was it really a good idea to bring the cursed skull here?"
"204987124-0-55578";"Is Concordia here, too?"
"204987124-0-55579";"Who's Kassandra?"
"204987124-0-55580";"Is Concordia here, too?"
"204987124-0-55581";"And you're one of these ku-vastei?"
"204987124-0-55582";"How so?"
"204987124-0-55583";"That sounds more like destruction."
"204987124-0-55584";"You said something before: ku-vastei. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-55586";"No, but I still like order."
"204987124-0-55587";"What's your point?"
"204987124-0-55588";"What's your point?"
"204987124-0-55589";"What's your point?"
"204987124-0-55593";"Hail Sithis, egg-sister."
"204987124-0-55596";"How is your daughter doing?"
"204987124-0-55597";"Are you going to stay in Lilmoth?"
"204987124-0-55599";"Safe travels."
"204987124-0-55602";"I heard you talking. The Aldmeri Dominion really isn't sending any troops?"
"204987124-0-55604";"Dragonguard? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-55606";"The last Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-55607";"I'll head to Sandswirl Manor and find Prefect Calo as soon as I can."
"204987124-0-55609";"Tell me what you need me to do."
"204987124-0-55612";"Thanks for the advice. Any tribes I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-55613";"I've seen what you can do. We might need your strength before all this is over."
"204987124-0-55615";"We can go look for Kinaro and Hursh."
"204987124-0-55617";"Stay safe while we find your missing family members."
"204987124-0-55618";"Any idea what the soldiers are looking for?"
"204987124-0-55620";"First things first. Return to your farmhouse and gather your family. Then get inside the town."
"204987124-0-55621";"Euraxian forces are right outside! You'll all die here, just like your brother."
"204987124-0-55623";"Zamarak promised to take care of Hursh. You just be careful and stay safe."
"204987124-0-55624";"Mayhem and destruction, I can do that."
"204987124-0-55625";"I think the soldiers are also looking for the body parts Zumog Phoom seeks."
"204987124-0-55626";"The necromancer is Zumog Phoom. And the Betrayer's head … that's you, Cadwell."
"204987124-0-55627";"Let's get back to Riverhold."
"204987124-0-55628";"So you just figured out how to make traps by thinking about it?"
"204987124-0-55630";"That's how you originally died, right?"
"204987124-0-55632";"All right, I'll meet you inside the manor house."
"204987124-0-55636";"What kind of opportunity can end the Alliance War?"
"204987124-0-55637";"I'll help you find this weapon."
"204987124-0-55638";"How can a Khajiiti loremaster help us find an ancient weapon?"
"204987124-0-55640";"Where did you get the Wrathstones?"
"204987124-0-55642";"A map? So you know where we need to go to find the weapon?"
"204987124-0-55643";"A map? So you know where we need to go to find the weapon?"
"204987124-0-55644";"Queen Anequina? First War of the Prides?"
"204987124-0-55645";"So who was Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-0-55646";"Should I be worried?"
"204987124-0-55647";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-0-55649";"Yes. Please tell me the beginning of the story."
"204987124-0-55650";"A demon? Like a Daedra?"
"204987124-0-55652";"Thank you, moon-singer."
"204987124-0-55653";"Are the town's defenses ready for this attack?"
"204987124-0-55655";"I'm ready to defend Riverhold."
"204987124-0-55656";"So where do we need to go to find the first triangulant?"
"204987124-0-55657";"Wormroot Depths? I think I've visited that place."
"204987124-0-55659";"I'll meet you inside Wormroot Depths."
"204987124-0-55660";"I'll meet you inside Wormroot Depths."
"204987124-0-55663";"First, tell me why they locked you in that cell."
"204987124-0-55664";"So why lock you up now?"
"204987124-0-55665";"You seem unusually willing to cooperate with an ally of the rightful Khajiiti queen."
"204987124-0-55673";"Someone is still following you?"
"204987124-0-55675";"Well, good luck with that. I'll meet you inside Black Vine Ruins."
"204987124-0-55676";"Yes. Please tell me your part of the story."
"204987124-0-55678";"Thank you, moon-singer."
"204987124-0-55679";"That sounds ominous."
"204987124-0-55681";"Did you see or hear anything else?"
"204987124-0-55685";"Your memories of your life are returning?"
"204987124-0-55688";"I read Prefect Calo's report myself. Euraxia issued the order to appease Kaalgrontiid."
"204987124-0-55692";"Yes. Please tell me your part of the story."
"204987124-0-55694";"Thank you, moon-singer."
"204987124-0-55695";"Who was the third companion?"
"204987124-0-55696";"How do I know you're really going to use the weapon to end the war?"
"204987124-0-55698";"If you say so. I'll meet you at Jode's Light."
"204987124-0-55700";"Do you think that will go over well?"
"204987124-0-55701";"What are you planning to do with siegecraft?"
"204987124-0-55707";"Who's Euraxia?"
"204987124-0-55708";"Who's the Speaker of the Mane?"
"204987124-0-55709";"Abnur never mentioned that his sister was involved."
"204987124-0-55710";"And who's the Mane?"
"204987124-0-55711";"Did you face Captain Saulinia back then?"
"204987124-0-55714";"There's also the Dragons and Zumog Phoom's necromancers."
"204987124-0-55716";"So what happens next?"
"204987124-0-55720";"Why not talk to Abnur Tharn directly about destroying the weapon?"
"204987124-0-55721";"How many agents like you does the Mane have in Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-55722";"How many agents like you does the Mane have in Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-55723";"How many agents like you does the Mane have in Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-55724";"How many agents like you does the Mane have in Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-55725";"Misguided? In what way?"
"204987124-0-55726";"Who's the Speaker of the Mane?"
"204987124-0-55727";"That's a powerful and unusual sort of gift."
"204987124-0-55728";"Who's the Speaker of the Mane?"
"204987124-0-55729";"I don't think she's a mage. She wants to help us get to the weapon before Euraxia Tharn."
"204987124-0-55730";"If finding the weapon gives us a chance to stop the Three Banners War, it's worth the risk."
"204987124-0-55731";"She's afraid you'll balk at her ultimate goal. She says the weapon's a danger and must be destroyed."
"204987124-0-55732";"All right, let's look around."
"204987124-0-55734";"I agree we need to get to the weapon before Euraxia. Let's go find the last triangulant."
"204987124-0-55736";"Do you have any idea what halted the flow?"
"204987124-0-55739";"Yes, I'll help you investigate and return the flow of water to S'rendarr's Cradle."
"204987124-0-55741";"Why is it forbidden?"
"204987124-0-55743";"All right. I'll head to the second gate."
"204987124-0-55744";"You think the person who dropped this is responsible for the water shortage?"
"204987124-0-55746";"How do you propose we find them?"
"204987124-0-55747";"The leader called Vazbi by name and urged his people to burn S'rendarr's Cradle. Why?"
"204987124-0-55749";"All right. Let's go save Vazbi."
"204987124-0-55750";"Do you really believe that?"
"204987124-0-55753";"I wonder if Khamira will continue to follow us."
"204987124-0-55755";"Khamira found us, didn't she?"
"204987124-0-55756";"Silhu-jo told me he was ready for this. It's his penance for something he did a long time ago."
"204987124-0-55759";"How could that be your fault? You can't take the blame for everything."
"204987124-0-55760";"Other sanctuaries? I thought you were the last of the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-55761";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-55764";"What do you mean S'rendarr's Cradle is a lie?"
"204987124-0-55765";"Where did they take the animals?"
"204987124-0-55766";"Is there really a way to stop the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-55767";"Dragonguard Orland?"
"204987124-0-55778";"Any suggestions on how to get in?"
"204987124-0-55780";"Arkay's lash?"
"204987124-0-55782";"Why can't you come with me yourself?"
"204987124-0-55788";"You lived among Goblins?"
"204987124-0-55789";"You don't seem to have made much progress."
"204987124-0-55790";"Is that how you met your friend?"
"204987124-0-55791";"Who is this custodian and where do I find him?"
"204987124-0-55792";"Do we have the forces to make a direct assault on Rimmen Palace?"
"204987124-0-55797";"I'll head to the shrine and talk to Aneshi."
"204987124-0-55799";"I'll speak to Lord Gharesh-ri."
"204987124-0-55805";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-55806";"All right, I'll go rescue your companions."
"204987124-0-55816";"Cadwell's essence? You mean his soul?"
"204987124-0-55819";"The other adepts let you do that?"
"204987124-0-55825";"And now you've put your life on the line to save her again?"
"204987124-0-55826";"What does Vazbi have to do with this?"
"204987124-0-55836";"You think hunters will help you bring animals back to the Prowl?"
"204987124-0-55837";"We're going to assault Rimmen Palace, but we need a way to slip inside without being spotted."
"204987124-0-55838";"I'll take the directions and go find your master key."
"204987124-0-55839";"What is the skeevaton's function?"
"204987124-0-55840";"Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-55841";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-55842";"If you say so. I'll go help Captain Nala-do destroy the siege weapons now."
"204987124-0-55849";"How do we help Cadwell? We don't even know where he went."
"204987124-0-55850";"I'll find Zumog Phoom's lair in the Scar and meet you there."
"204987124-0-55855";"Khamira can handle herself. And she will be with Abnur Tharn."
"204987124-0-55856";"Let's go find the crypt door."
"204987124-0-55859";"Could it have been Zumog Phoom or one of his necromancers?"
"204987124-0-55864";"Tell me more about the Akaviri."
"204987124-0-55866";"What about Zamarak and Prefect Calo? Have you seen them?"
"204987124-0-55867";"Maybe we can recover your stolen energy. Either way, we need to stop Zumog Phoom."
"204987124-0-55871";"Can you tell me about these Three Proofs?"
"204987124-0-55872";"Could that explain what happened to the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-55873";"Zumog Phoom mentioned they were abandoning Euraxia. Any idea what that means?"
"204987124-0-55874";"Will you be all right now?"
"204987124-0-55875";"All right, I'll talk to Domitia Nasica."
"204987124-0-55876";"I'd like to join this festival, if I may."
"204987124-0-55877";"Tell me about this festival."
"204987124-0-55878";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-0-55879";"Why did Hakoshae stop celebrating it?"
"204987124-0-55880";"Why has your family always led the town?"
"204987124-0-55881";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-55883";"I'll place the paper lotus in the river."
"204987124-0-55884";"What was that about Dragon imagery?"
"204987124-0-55886";"Is there any way to stop the process before the vault opens?"
"204987124-0-55887";"Do you think there will be more traps to deal with?"
"204987124-0-55889";"Any suggestions on how to open the door?"
"204987124-0-55890";"After what?"
"204987124-0-55892";"I'm with you. How do we stop the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-55893";"The ritual was using Cadwell's energy. What happened to it?"
"204987124-0-55894";"How does that prove my strength?"
"204987124-0-55895";"Can you return the energy to Cadwell, Nala-do?"
"204987124-0-55897";"Rest easy, Nala-do."
"204987124-0-55899";"All right, I'll bring you back the flower."
"204987124-0-55905";"Is this another Akaviri belief?"
"204987124-0-55907";"Stop him? What's the Betrayer planning to do?"
"204987124-0-55910";"All right, I'll go speak with Valoria."
"204987124-0-55911";"Death?"
"204987124-0-55915";"How did that stop the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-55921";"I have to solve a riddle?"
"204987124-0-55922";"I'll return with the correct item."
"204987124-0-55923";"Cadwell began to remember. He said the Betrayer seeks a special place to find Jode's Core."
"204987124-0-55924";"Do you know what Cadwell was talking about?"
"204987124-0-55928";"Tell me about the Proof of Wisdom."
"204987124-0-55929";"Poor thing?"
"204987124-0-55930";"I see. Thank you."
"204987124-0-55941";"Where would we find such a document?"
"204987124-0-55942";"And how do you propose that we break in?"
"204987124-0-55944";"All right. I'll distract the guard."
"204987124-0-55946";"Were you able to complete the Three Proofs?"
"204987124-0-55947";"You said your mother told you that Anequina could make the moons move for Khunzar-ri."
"204987124-0-55948";"That sounds like the Shadow Dance Ruins. I guess we need to investigate the place."
"204987124-0-55949";"Could that be what Cadwell was talking about? Tell me the rest of the story."
"204987124-0-55950";"You said your mother would sometimes hold it and tell you stories. Maybe something she said …?"
"204987124-0-55951";"It couldn't hurt to give it a try."
"204987124-0-55954";"I see. Well, I'd best be off."
"204987124-0-55955";"How did you solve it?"
"204987124-0-55958";"That's what you came here for? What is it?"
"204987124-0-55959";"What leads do you have?"
"204987124-0-55962";"Let's find a kidnapper."
"204987124-0-55963";"Are a lot of your cases dangerous?"
"204987124-0-55964";"How did you come up with it?"
"204987124-0-55965";"Let's find a kidnapper."
"204987124-0-55966";"Why do you need an assistant?"
"204987124-0-55998";"Right. Then the Betrayer stabbed Khunzar-ri in the back."
"204987124-0-55999";"You want me to take part in a robbery?"
"204987124-0-56001";"I'll help you relieve Khasda of his wealth."
"204987124-0-56002";"The moon-priests stopped the Betrayer back then."
"204987124-0-56008";"So you believe that spirit is one of Magnate Feina-Darak's ancestors?"
"204987124-0-56009";"What's the history between those two?"
"204987124-0-56010";"Abnur Tharn tried to reseal the vault and stop the Dragons from escaping."
"204987124-0-56011";"Euraxia's soldiers reached the ruins before we did. They would have broken the seal eventually."
"204987124-0-56013";"We'll figure something out."
"204987124-0-56014";"So you have a plan for containing the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-56016";"So what do we do about that?"
"204987124-0-56019";"She wants us to gather in the Bowel."
"204987124-0-56020";"So you'll join her crew?"
"204987124-0-56021";"So Elsweyr is doomed?"
"204987124-0-56022";"But there's no way the magnate could take over Cyrodiil now."
"204987124-0-56023";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-56025";"I'll activate the temple relic."
"204987124-0-56026";"What are you going to do with him?"
"204987124-0-56027";"You should let him go."
"204987124-0-56028";"You're not going to look for him?"
"204987124-0-56029";"There's no way you two could make amends?"
"204987124-0-56030";"So you'll join up?"
"204987124-0-56031";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-0-56032";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56033";"So a Morag Tong assassin killed you?"
"204987124-0-56034";"Your patron?"
"204987124-0-56035";"What have you discovered so far?"
"204987124-0-56036";"Where is Quintus?"
"204987124-0-56037";"What exactly is a ""focus?"""
"204987124-0-56038";"Where is it?"
"204987124-0-56039";"Worse for who?"
"204987124-0-56041";"But why abduct Magnate Feina-Darak? She didn't betray you."
"204987124-0-56042";"I'll relay the message to her."
"204987124-0-56043";"You're behind the madness at the temple, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-56047";"All right. I'll pay you for Sereyne's focus."
"204987124-0-56048";"Do you know anything that might help the investigation?"
"204987124-0-56052";"So you want to keep lying about your ancestry?"
"204987124-0-56055";"I'll head to the stables next then."
"204987124-0-56056";"If you're that concerned about the focus, I can make sure you never see it again."
"204987124-0-56059";"Let's get going then."
"204987124-0-56061";"So, you'll join Tasnasi's crew?"
"204987124-0-56062";"If that means you're in, we're meeting in the Bowel."
"204987124-0-56065";"Any tips on what I should ask her about?"
"204987124-0-56067";"Can I ask why?"
"204987124-0-56068";"Why were you practicing in the bottom of a canyon?"
"204987124-0-56069";"What if I got the lute back for you?"
"204987124-0-56071";"They want to blind themselves?"
"204987124-0-56074";"A lot of what?"
"204987124-0-56075";"All right. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-56083";"Could I have the hat back?"
"204987124-0-56088";"Don't make me hurt you, old man."
"204987124-0-56089";"Could be worth investigating this rock formation, at the very least."
"204987124-0-56090";"Got it. Let's head to the Sleeping Badger rock formation."
"204987124-0-56092";"What brought you here?"
"204987124-0-56099";"This is more than just a heist for you, from the sounds of it."
"204987124-0-56101";"I'm all ears."
"204987124-0-56102";"I'm all ears."
"204987124-0-56105";"So she's enslaved them?"
"204987124-0-56107";"Why are you trying to hurt the priests?"
"204987124-0-56109";"Maybe some of your visions were real, but all you're doing now is hurting your followers."
"204987124-0-56112";"I'm real. Just come down from the ledge and I'll help you."
"204987124-0-56113";"What happened? How did we end up here?"
"204987124-0-56114";"How do we regroup?"
"204987124-0-56116";"Where should we search?"
"204987124-0-56118";"All right, I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-56119";"Years? Ishu said it was only a few days past."
"204987124-0-56121";"I'll tell Mizzik what you said."
"204987124-0-56122";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-56123";"What's not fair is you cheating."
"204987124-0-56124";"All right, then let's get to it."
"204987124-0-56126";"I think I deserve to know what you'll be doing while we get the keys."
"204987124-0-56127";"Don't be a sore loser."
"204987124-0-56128";"""My name three times backwards."""
"204987124-0-56131";"I'm not sure. She also wants us to stop investigating."
"204987124-0-56136";"Perhaps the nearby river is the blue serpent?"
"204987124-0-56138";"All right, let's start searching along the river."
"204987124-0-56141";"Tell me more about this singing Wood Elf."
"204987124-0-56142";"A bit eccentric?"
"204987124-0-56144";"Don't worry, Mizzik and I won't give up."
"204987124-0-56145";"Tell me more about this singing Wood Elf."
"204987124-0-56146";"Tell me more about Zinthia."
"204987124-0-56147";"So you're the leader of the smugglers?"
"204987124-0-56149";"Understood."
"204987124-0-56150";"I've never heard of you."
"204987124-0-56151";"I just want more information, Sarazi."
"204987124-0-56152";"And how do you plan on doing that?"
"204987124-0-56154";"All right, I'll see if I can find out where she disappeared to."
"204987124-0-56156";"Can you describe Burtle in detail? I need to know what I'm looking for."
"204987124-0-56157";"Dog means death? Really?"
"204987124-0-56158";"Are you … describing a dog?"
"204987124-0-56159";"What kind of monster are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-56161";"All right, I'll find this Burtle and bring it back."
"204987124-0-56162";"We also stopped a smuggling operation."
"204987124-0-56164";"All right, I'll meet you at the inn."
"204987124-0-56174";"I'll buy what's left of your food from you."
"204987124-0-56176";"Pleasure doing business with you."
"204987124-0-56178";"That's what I thought."
"204987124-0-56180";"Any idea where the farmhands may have gone?"
"204987124-0-56183";"You think this will increase sales?"
"204987124-0-56185";"What are you going to do with him then?"
"204987124-0-56189";"Don't do this, Tasnasi. If you kill him, there is no coming back. The Stitches is still your home."
"204987124-0-56190";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-56191";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-56192";"Part of you still cares about it. Your crew sees it. I see it. It's not too late to fix things."
"204987124-0-56196";"Why such dedication?"
"204987124-0-56197";"Why would Azurah lead you somewhere that's dangerous?"
"204987124-0-56198";"Where are the Brothers of Strife?"
"204987124-0-56199";"Where is Torinaan?"
"204987124-0-56200";"Where is Torinaan?"
"204987124-0-56201";"Where are the Brothers of Strife?"
"204987124-0-56203";"What's so bad about the way you used to live?"
"204987124-0-56207";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56209";"Are you suggesting we give up, Abnur Tharn?"
"204987124-0-56211";"You seem pretty confident. Why do you need my assistance?"
"204987124-0-56212";"Fair enough. I was also curious about your rather interesting name."
"204987124-0-56213";"The Betrayer set the moons to eclipse, but we killed him and Khamira is now attuned to the Lattice."
"204987124-0-56215";"I won't be your next victim."
"204987124-0-56216";"We'll probably have to fight your people to do that."
"204987124-0-56217";"You don't sound confident about the outcome of the battle."
"204987124-0-56218";"Where can I find Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-0-56219";"You don't sound confident about the outcome of the battle."
"204987124-0-56221";"Yes. I killed the Betrayer, but not before he set the moons in motion to open the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-56222";"Has there been much trouble integrating your forces with the Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-56224";"So you think we can stop the assault?"
"204987124-0-56231";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-56232";"Are you sure about this?"
"204987124-0-56233";"I'll guard the Dragonhorn and join up with Khamira. Good luck, Zamarak."
"204987124-0-56236";"Why do you dislike Caldathir so much?"
"204987124-0-56237";"You want to bring an animal back to life?"
"204987124-0-56242";"I don't understand. Why would the Dragons agree to give up a part of their power?"
"204987124-0-56243";"Then let's get down there."
"204987124-0-56249";"You really want me to kill him?"
"204987124-0-56254";"What was the prophecy you took to the Speaker of the Mane?"
"204987124-0-56262";"Do you know who these necromancers are?"
"204987124-0-56270";"Are we really sure that we defeated Kaalgrontiid? He seemed extremely powerful at the end."
"204987124-0-56272";"Why did the Mane send an envoy?"
"204987124-0-56274";"What kind of weapon is powerful enough to stop the war?"
"204987124-0-56275";"What kind of weapon is powerful enough to stop the war?"
"204987124-0-56279";"I guess that depends. What is necromancy, exactly?"
"204987124-0-56305";"But I destroyed it."
"204987124-0-56311";"What will it take to get you to leave these people alone?"
"204987124-0-56316";"And if I agree?"
"204987124-0-56319";"How do you know this?"
"204987124-0-56321";"Where is Arum-Khal now? I need to know more."
"204987124-0-56322";"What did Khunzar-ri do?"
"204987124-0-56323";"The envoy doesn't believe you're King Hemakar's daughter?"
"204987124-0-56325";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-56328";"Abnur Tharn says you can direct us to moon-singers who can recite the secret tales of Khunzar-ri."
"204987124-0-56329";"Here are the dusk mushrooms. Now tell me where I can find the moon-singers."
"204987124-0-56331";"I'll tell Abnur Tharn about the moon-singers."
"204987124-0-56332";"I'll use the portal and go find Azargo Long-Tale."
"204987124-0-56336";"You seem to know a lot about the Khajiiti legends already."
"204987124-0-56337";"You seem to know a lot about the Khajiiti legends already."
"204987124-0-56338";"You seem to know a lot about the Khajiiti legends already."
"204987124-0-56339";"It's the Skooma Cat, remember? He's making you see false visions."
"204987124-0-56341";"Sizenza?"
"204987124-0-56345";"How's it supposed to do that?"
"204987124-0-56347";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-56351";"The Moonlight Blade?"
"204987124-0-56352";"May I ask you some questions?"
"204987124-0-56355";"So why ask me for my help?"
"204987124-0-56356";"How has your ranch been affected?"
"204987124-0-56357";"If you know this much about Arum-Khal, you can help me stop him."
"204987124-0-56359";"All right, I will deal with these poachers and retrieve your whistle."
"204987124-0-56361";"Triangulants? Is that a real word?"
"204987124-0-56365";"Your farmhands have gone missing?"
"204987124-0-56367";"I'll talk to your mother at Sweetwater Farmstead."
"204987124-0-56368";"I can look into this for you."
"204987124-0-56370";"I'll get your eldest son and start my investigation."
"204987124-0-56371";"Your mother mentioned a rival, M'zum, might be invovled."
"204987124-0-56372";"Someone threatened you?"
"204987124-0-56373";"Moving on. You seem pretty confident. Why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-56374";"Doesn't seem like the best quality for an investigator to have …."
"204987124-0-56376";"I'll meet you at Fragrant Moons Plantation."
"204987124-0-56377";"What are we looking for?"
"204987124-0-56378";"Journals. Got it."
"204987124-0-56380";"What test?"
"204987124-0-56383";"I still have questions, Mazza-Mirri."
"204987124-0-56385";"What can we do?"
"204987124-0-56386";"How could that artifact have helped them?"
"204987124-0-56388";"I'll head to Honey-Breeze Homestead."
"204987124-0-56390";"I'll save your daughters from this monster."
"204987124-0-56393";"What's our next step?"
"204987124-0-56395";"Very well, let's head to your mother's farm."
"204987124-0-56398";"Do you have him under control now?"
"204987124-0-56402";"And what's that?"
"204987124-0-56403";"How do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56404";"Will you remain as the Moon-Bishop?"
"204987124-0-56406";"All right, let's begin our search."
"204987124-0-56409";"Saevus? Who's that?"
"204987124-0-56412";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-56415";"Then let's finish this."
"204987124-0-56417";"I might know someone who can help. I'll find a way to restore the blade."
"204987124-0-56421";"What did Khunzar-ri do?"
"204987124-0-56425";"Your age? Is that what's bothering you?"
"204987124-0-56431";"What do you know about Meridia?"
"204987124-0-56433";"What did Khunzar-ri do?"
"204987124-0-56434";"All right, let's go destroy some undead."
"204987124-0-56436";"You said Arum-Khal wants to be free of Azurah? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56437";"Queen Khamira is the daughter of King Hemakar. We killed Euraxia and now Khamira rules Rimmen."
"204987124-0-56438";"I saved your life. You must know a way I can get into the manor house, right?"
"204987124-0-56443";"Once I kill the Shades, then what?"
"204987124-0-56445";"All right. I'll kill these Shades."
"204987124-0-56447";"Do you know how Euraxia and the Dragons wound up working together?"
"204987124-0-56448";"Any idea what that might have been?"
"204987124-0-56455";"All right, I'll head to Tajirri's home and search for clues."
"204987124-0-56459";"Attributes: Make a donation"
"204987124-0-56461";"Can we get her back to normal?"
"204987124-0-56463";"I'll find Arnus Rast  and Oloro."
"204987124-0-56477";"All right, let's head to Hakoshae's tombs."
"204987124-0-56478";"Don't worry. He won't escape again. I'll finish him."
"204987124-0-56480";"What's the risk?"
"204987124-0-56481";"Are you willing to take the risk?"
"204987124-0-56483";"What is the Akaviri spirit's message?"
"204987124-0-56489";"Is there any chance that the source of the water ran dry?"
"204987124-0-56495";"What can you tell me about S'rendarr's Cradle?"
"204987124-0-56496";"How have you dealt with the Dragon attacks?"
"204987124-0-56497";"Has the aqueduct ever gone dry before?"
"204987124-0-56499";"Are all adepts here healers?"
"204987124-0-56500";"Has the aqueduct ever gone dry before?"
"204987124-0-56501";"Did any of your other family members survive the flu?"
"204987124-0-56502";"So your grandfather assassinated the Akaviri we're chasing?"
"204987124-0-56503";"Notoriety might be what the killer wants."
"204987124-0-56504";"Why come to me for this? Don't the tribes have ways of dealing with this kind of crime?"
"204987124-0-56505";"Notoriety might be what the killer wants."
"204987124-0-56506";"Why do you feel you're safe among the Dead-Water tribe?"
"204987124-0-56507";"Let's go stop the assassination squad."
"204987124-0-56510";"All right, let's move ahead."
"204987124-0-56512";"But won't you run out of water soon?"
"204987124-0-56513";"Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-56514";"Are you in charge?"
"204987124-0-56515";"Why are you worried about Vazbi trying to restore the water?"
"204987124-0-56516";"Any idea what it might be?"
"204987124-0-56518";"All right. I'll head to the second gate."
"204987124-0-56519";"You're not coming with me? I'm supposed to protect you."
"204987124-0-56522";"And you mentioned there's been no ransom?"
"204987124-0-56523";"Tell me about your career as an investigator."
"204987124-0-56524";"And the town guards have been no help?"
"204987124-0-56528";"I still don't understand why you were in exile, Zamarak."
"204987124-0-56534";"Are you alright?"
"204987124-0-56539";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56546";"Do you live in Riverhold?"
"204987124-0-56547";"Still, that's your job, isn't it?"
"204987124-0-56549";"So, this gift-giver left a trail to lead us here? Why do you think it's related to the drought?"
"204987124-0-56551";"Yes. Let's get moving."
"204987124-0-56552";"Fair enough. You said this place is forbidden. Why?"
"204987124-0-56554";"You said it ate most of the wildlife in the Prowl?"
"204987124-0-56555";"So you fixed it up?"
"204987124-0-56556";"You mentioned a Dragon attack?"
"204987124-0-56558";"Were all these animals harmed by hunters?"
"204987124-0-56559";"What did you rescue them from?"
"204987124-0-56560";"What are the Halls of Colossus?"
"204987124-0-56561";"Who's Khamira?"
"204987124-0-56562";"Your half-sister?"
"204987124-0-56563";"You mean the stories aren't true?"
"204987124-0-56564";"What are the Halls of Colossus?"
"204987124-0-56565";"So there really is a demon weapon?"
"204987124-0-56566";"You mentioned a Dragon attack?"
"204987124-0-56567";"Sounds like they're a handful."
"204987124-0-56568";"What are the Halls of Colossus?"
"204987124-0-56569";"I've killed one."
"204987124-0-56570";"Can you tell me more about your ranch?"
"204987124-0-56572";"So you think Khamira made a mistake revealing her true identity to rally your people?"
"204987124-0-56574";"How is it that Khamira's identity was able to remain a secret all this time?"
"204987124-0-56575";"You mentioned Lord Gharesh-ri and Khamira. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-56577";"I know Sir Cadwell!"
"204987124-0-56578";"You mentioned Lord Gharesh-ri and Khamira. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-56579";"Abnur Tharn sent me to check on surges of power he detected."
"204987124-0-56580";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-56584";"Who assassinated them?"
"204987124-0-56587";"Tell me more about the Akaviri."
"204987124-0-56588";"Abnur Tharn said that if I found you, I should ask if you'll help us with Elsweyr's Dragon problem."
"204987124-0-56590";"Then we'll see you soon."
"204987124-0-56591";"You were right. It was Cadwell. He was drawn to an old grave of someone called the Betrayer."
"204987124-0-56592";"Cadwell agreed to help, but you should know he's been having some strange dreams."
"204987124-0-56593";"Why can't you order the retreat?"
"204987124-0-56594";"Are these documents really that important?"
"204987124-0-56596";"I'll find the documents, deliver them to Nala-do, and meet you south of the camp."
"204987124-0-56597";"Who did you just kill?"
"204987124-0-56598";"How long has Euraxia been employing necromancers?"
"204987124-0-56600";"I'll find Abnur Tharn and pass along the message."
"204987124-0-56601";"Nala-do said Euraxia's chief necromancer, Zumog Phoom, recently brought his followers to Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-56602";"I can track down the source of the necromantic power."
"204987124-0-56604";"I'll track down the source of the undead in the western mountains and keep an eye out for Khamira."
"204987124-0-56605";"Abnur Tharn said you should return to Riverhold."
"204987124-0-56606";"So you expect us to surrender?"
"204987124-0-56607";"And if we refuse to leave?"
"204987124-0-56608";"And if we refuse to leave?"
"204987124-0-56611";"I'll tell Abnur Tharn what you said."
"204987124-0-56612";"It wants Abnur Tharn and me to leave Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-56614";"I need to get to Riverhold and inform Gharesh-ri and Abnur Tharn."
"204987124-0-56615";"I spoke to the Dragon Mulaamnir. He said that Euraxia was their puppet. He told us to leave Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-56616";"Why not try that? Let's go talk to your half-sister in Rimmen."
"204987124-0-56617";"Have you spoken to Cadwell? He's worried about that disturbed grave where you sent me to meet him."
"204987124-0-56618";"Stop this."
"204987124-0-56620";"Can you tell me anything about the people that kidnapped Vazbi?"
"204987124-0-56621";"What's your plan for saving Vazbi?"
"204987124-0-56622";"And then?"
"204987124-0-56623";"What's your plan for saving Vazbi?"
"204987124-0-56624";"Did that sort of thing happen often in those days?"
"204987124-0-56625";"If you left the Stricken here to die, how did they survive?"
"204987124-0-56626";"But this was years ago. Have the Stricken been in Baan Dar's Litter the whole time?"
"204987124-0-56627";"Do you think they all mean to do you and the adeptorium harm?"
"204987124-0-56628";"What was the mortality rate of the Knahaten Flu?"
"204987124-0-56629";"Yes."
"204987124-0-56630";"How can you call yourself a healer after leaving these people to die?"
"204987124-0-56631";"If you left the Stricken here to die, how did they survive?"
"204987124-0-56632";"If you left the Stricken here to die, how did they survive?"
"204987124-0-56633";"If you left the Stricken here to die, how did they survive?"
"204987124-0-56634";"If you left the Stricken here to die, how did they survive?"
"204987124-0-56635";"All right, I'll deal with Rahti and rescue your animals."
"204987124-0-56644";"Gone? What was gone?"
"204987124-0-56646";"You think the Betrayer's head has something to do with the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-56650";"I need to stop this."
"204987124-0-56654";"What's so bad about the way you used to live?"
"204987124-0-56655";"Tell me about the Proving Festival."
"204987124-0-56656";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-56658";"No, I don't think so."
"204987124-0-56660";"I'll go see Lieutenant Talia about that key."
"204987124-0-56662";"You want to spar with me?"
"204987124-0-56666";"Thanks for the help."
"204987124-0-56667";"He said that he's your father."
"204987124-0-56669";"We have to stop him."
"204987124-0-56677";"Stay. Your dream of being a healer still means something. History can't change that."
"204987124-0-56678";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-56680";"I wish you luck with that."
"204987124-0-56681";"Do you think you'll be able to find them?"
"204987124-0-56682";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-56689";"Is that based on an Akaviri belief?"
"204987124-0-56690";"What's an assassination squad?"
"204987124-0-56692";"So Euraxia wasn't sent to conquer Rimmen?"
"204987124-0-56693";"Tell me about Captain Saulinia."
"204987124-0-56695";"And you said this was your first Proving Festival?"
"204987124-0-56696";"And do you believe that?"
"204987124-0-56697";"Meaning what, exactly?"
"204987124-0-56698";"All right."
"204987124-0-56699";"Who is this Skooma Cat?"
"204987124-0-56700";"He appeared as a small cat."
"204987124-0-56701";"What do you believe?"
"204987124-0-56705";"Are the Akaviri known to be great warriors?"
"204987124-0-56707";"The Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-56708";"What are you going to be doing while Nala-do, Khamira, and I deal with the siege weapons?"
"204987124-0-56709";"Where should I meet Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-0-56710";"No insinuations were intended, Tharn."
"204987124-0-56711";"Zamarak, if you have something to tell me, I want to hear it."
"204987124-0-56712";"You blamed yourself for what happened to the royal family. So why did you decide to return?"
"204987124-0-56713";"You served Khamira's father?"
"204987124-0-56714";"Why riddles?"
"204987124-0-56715";"Fear and threats of violence? What do you mean, exactly?"
"204987124-0-56716";"All right, show me how Euraxia keeps the Khajiiti in line."
"204987124-0-56717";"There's nothing the Khajiit can do?"
"204987124-0-56718";"It sounds like slavery."
"204987124-0-56720";"Let's move on."
"204987124-0-56721";"A fur tax?"
"204987124-0-56723";"Let's move on."
"204987124-0-56724";"Euraxia would destroy the city?"
"204987124-0-56725";"Can they really target the weapons that precisely?"
"204987124-0-56727";"I think it's time we went and had a talk with Euraxia Tharn."
"204987124-0-56728";"Is that Cadwell's head?"
"204987124-0-56731";"Why did you dig up Cadwell's head?"
"204987124-0-56737";"So you're living on the street?"
"204987124-0-56740";"And there's no other place I can find these trinkets?"
"204987124-0-56741";"Did anything happen before they disappeared?"
"204987124-0-56742";"Can you tell me more about your farm?"
"204987124-0-56743";"And you said your brother and mother were arguing?"
"204987124-0-56745";"What can you tell me about the missing farmhands?"
"204987124-0-56746";"All right. Can you tell me the riddle again?"
"204987124-0-56747";"Is the magnate a scholar then?"
"204987124-0-56748";"Sounds like you don't get along with your eldest son."
"204987124-0-56749";"You mentioned someone named M'zum?"
"204987124-0-56750";"And you think he's behind the missing farmhands?"
"204987124-0-56751";"A Dragon helped the undead your necromancers unleashed on the Khajiiti Defense Force."
"204987124-0-56752";"Speaking of Euraxia Tharn, how did the both of you wind up vying for the hidden weapon?"
"204987124-0-56753";"Have you confronted M'zum about this?"
"204987124-0-56754";"And you want me to take your eldest son along on my investigation?"
"204987124-0-56760";"They have a Dragon as well. That makes escaping difficult."
"204987124-0-56761";"I'll find this Dragonhorn and see if it can defeat the Dragon."
"204987124-0-56762";"What's in the Dragonhorn Tower?"
"204987124-0-56764";"The Grand Adept and Zamarak should be heading out as well."
"204987124-0-56765";"So the Dragonguard helped Elsweyr fight against the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-56767";"How are things in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-56768";"Summerset was certainly an adventure. Reminds me of our time chasing the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-0-56769";"How did things go after our time in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-56770";"How did everything go after our time in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-56771";"You don't seem to get along with your family."
"204987124-0-56772";"What about your brother, Rakhzargo?"
"204987124-0-56773";"Did you hear what Euraxia said to Zumog Phoom?"
"204987124-0-56774";"We need to warn Gharesh-ri!"
"204987124-0-56776";"All right, stay close."
"204987124-0-56777";"So they don't know about your friendship with Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-56778";"Don't they know you're an Eye of the Queen?"
"204987124-0-56779";"There's no way I can be in two places at the same time."
"204987124-0-56781";"What is the Desert Wind Adeptorium and where do I find it?"
"204987124-0-56782";"Where is M'zum's Fragrant Moons Plantation?"
"204987124-0-56783";"No killing, right. I'll try my best."
"204987124-0-56784";"Who are the Redhands?"
"204987124-0-56785";"Anything I should keep in mind while we're inside the plantation grounds?"
"204987124-0-56786";"Why would Euraxia's soldiers want the Grand Adept?"
"204987124-0-56788";"The Sands Behind the Stars?"
"204987124-0-56789";"This claw I found is strange. Any idea what creature it might have come from?"
"204987124-0-56790";"What do you make of this journal we found?"
"204987124-0-56791";"Could it be connected to that strange claw I found?"
"204987124-0-56792";"What do you make of this journal we found?"
"204987124-0-56793";"What do you make of this journal we found?"
"204987124-0-56794";"Why would Zumog Phoom do this to you?"
"204987124-0-56795";"All right. I'll try to set you free."
"204987124-0-56796";"Tell me what you came here for and I'll try to set you free."
"204987124-0-56801";"Do you have a past with these three daughters?"
"204987124-0-56802";"Certain promises?"
"204987124-0-56804";"It's as you suspected. They sought one of the Grand Adept's secrets. Unfortunately, they succeeded."
"204987124-0-56806";"We need to see if Honey-Breeze is having similar issues. It makes sense to check."
"204987124-0-56808";"Then take the adepts to Riverhold. That's where Euraxia plans to strike next."
"204987124-0-56810";"The locations of Cadwell the Betrayer's severed body parts."
"204987124-0-56811";"The remaining Desert Wind adepts have agreed to help defend the city."
"204987124-0-56814";"I'll go find J'dathal."
"204987124-0-56817";"Where do I find the loremaster?"
"204987124-0-56820";"You think they were after the same artifact you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-56822";"I'm still looking for them."
"204987124-0-56824";"All right."
"204987124-0-56828";"If he is dead, how are you talking to him?"
"204987124-0-56829";"I'm still looking for them."
"204987124-0-56830";"I haven't found them yet."
"204987124-0-56832";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-56834";"Take care."
"204987124-0-56835";"You said there was something wrong with the Imperials here. What did you mean?"
"204987124-0-56836";"You said there was something wrong with the Imperials here. What did you mean?"
"204987124-0-56839";"<Enter Asylum Sanctorum.>"
"204987124-0-56841";"That's what you came here for? What is it?"
"204987124-0-56842";"That's what you came here for? What is it?"
"204987124-0-56843";"There's no going back the way we came. Now what?"
"204987124-0-56844";"There's no going back the way we came. Now what?"
"204987124-0-56847";"Very well. Now, care you explain this misunderstanding between you and J'dathal's daughters?"
"204987124-0-56850";"It's likely. Both M'zum and J'dathal had moon-sugar stolen."
"204987124-0-56854";"We've crossed paths before. She's the enemy of our enemies, but not our friend."
"204987124-0-56860";"Do you often visit Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-56861";"Any ideas about what Nayru is up to lately?"
"204987124-0-56862";"And you don't happen to have a writ, do you?"
"204987124-0-56863";"So you're an avatar of a trickster god, and you stole the mural? Why?"
"204987124-0-56864";"Fine. I'll play along with your game."
"204987124-0-56865";"All right, I'll find the pieces on my own then."
"204987124-0-56867";"Given the turn of events? What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-56870";"That's what he told me."
"204987124-0-56873";"Like the Dark Brotherhood?"
"204987124-0-56874";"And exactly what opportunity allowed you to leave?"
"204987124-0-56875";"With King Narilmor dead, we should be free to leave Garlas Malatar, correct?"
"204987124-0-56876";"With King Narilmor dead, we should be free to leave Garlas Malatar, correct?"
"204987124-0-56879";"Sounds good. I'm interested in these jobs."
"204987124-0-56880";"All right, I'm interested in the job."
"204987124-0-56881";"All right, I'm interested in the job."
"204987124-0-56884";"You mentioned someone named Vole?"
"204987124-0-56887";"And you were really going to kill Magnate Feina-Darak?"
"204987124-0-56888";"How so?"
"204987124-0-56890";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-56891";"<Enter Moongrave Fane.>"
"204987124-0-56892";"How do you plan to deal with the blight?"
"204987124-0-56894";"Actually, Maarselok turned Selene against me. I had to fight them both at the same time."
"204987124-0-56895";"<Enter Lair of Maarselok.>"
"204987124-0-56897";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-56903";"If you're asking for help, I'm willing."
"204987124-0-56908";"So, Alkosh is the most important?"
"204987124-0-56909";"Absolutely."
"204987124-0-56910";"So this has always been a temple to Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-56911";"Tell me about Sunspire."
"204987124-0-56912";"Why was Sunspire in peril?"
"204987124-0-56914";"<Enter Sunspire.>"
"204987124-0-56920";"How long have you served at the temple?"
"204987124-0-56926";"Who is Rajhin?"
"204987124-0-56927";"But you said it was shattered?"
"204987124-0-56939";"Can you tell me anything more about the monster that attacked you?"
"204987124-0-56940";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-56942";"Can you tell me anything more about this creature?"
"204987124-0-56943";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-56945";"Where is this creature? Can you tell me more about it?"
"204987124-0-56946";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-56949";"And where can I find Sugar-Slinger's den?"
"204987124-0-56951";"I'll collect the Singing Crystal from Sugar-Slinger's den."
"204987124-0-56952";"I can deliver the antidote for you."
"204987124-0-56955";"Your egg-mother's research notes?"
"204987124-0-56965";"Can you make out what's on the complete tablet?"
"204987124-0-56966";"Can you make out what's on the complete tablet?"
"204987124-0-56967";"But why did they call you the Betrayer?"
"204987124-0-56968";"Do you think you can find the missing half of the tablet?"
"204987124-0-56969";"Do you think you can find the missing half of the tablet?"
"204987124-0-56970";"Why would you do a thing like that?"
"204987124-0-56976";"If you say so."
"204987124-0-56978";"Then I guess we should keep looking."
"204987124-0-56981";"I'll tell Saviwa that your spirit is at peace."
"204987124-0-56983";"So the mural is broken?"
"204987124-0-56985";"Isn't it odd that the thief left a clue?"
"204987124-0-56986";"I can help you find the missing mural pieces."
"204987124-0-56987";"Who are all these people?"
"204987124-0-56988";"Any idea why the Dwemer had one half and the Ayleids the other?"
"204987124-0-56993";"I'll gather the blossom."
"204987124-0-56994";"I need to know more about this Khasda we're robbing."
"204987124-0-56995";"Who's Sereyne?"
"204987124-0-56996";"You mentioned someone named Vole?"
"204987124-0-56997";"You mentioned someone named Vole?"
"204987124-0-56998";"Who was Dashing Dasalzo?"
"204987124-0-56999";"I want to know more about Jubani's junk shop."
"204987124-0-57002";"Why's he got it out for her though?"
"204987124-0-57003";"Why were you tied up in that basement?"
"204987124-0-57004";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-57005";"What was it you were saying about Tasnasi before?"
"204987124-0-57006";"You ate a soul gem?"
"204987124-0-57007";"Cadwell, can you hear me?"
"204987124-0-57011";"I'm surprised you survived."
"204987124-0-57012";"So you ate a soul gem."
"204987124-0-57013";"What was it you were saying about Tasnasi before?"
"204987124-0-57014";"And that gave you knowledge of machines?"
"204987124-0-57016";"So what does the focus do?"
"204987124-0-57017";"Can you tell me more about the Avernos?"
"204987124-0-57018";"How can they get away with that?"
"204987124-0-57019";"Can you tell me more about this focus you need me to get?"
"204987124-0-57024";"How does he do that?"
"204987124-0-57026";"That seems harsh."
"204987124-0-57028";"That's not reassuring."
"204987124-0-57029";"Who'd she kill?"
"204987124-0-57030";"What are you looking for?"
"204987124-0-57031";"What were you saying about Tasnasi, earlier?"
"204987124-0-57032";"And who gave you the lute?"
"204987124-0-57033";"Why is the lute in the bottom of the canyon?"
"204987124-0-57034";"And Dasalzo changed all that?"
"204987124-0-57035";"So, you're an adept? How'd you end up in a place like this?"
"204987124-0-57036";"But now he's gone."
"204987124-0-57037";"That wasn't meant to last."
"204987124-0-57039";"What was the song?"
"204987124-0-57040";"Tell me more about Dashing Dasalzo."
"204987124-0-57041";"You're trying to become a bard?"
"204987124-0-57042";"Frostvault?"
"204987124-0-57044";"All right. Where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-57045";"How is the Wrathstone connected to this place?"
"204987124-0-57048";"He's working for free?"
"204987124-0-57050";"Dwarven locks?"
"204987124-0-57052";"So you shouldn't have any trouble opening them."
"204987124-0-57053";"You don't sound very confident."
"204987124-0-57055";"Why not just teleport us directly to the vault?"
"204987124-0-57057";"You're going to climb a tower?"
"204987124-0-57060";"How will we reach the vaults then?"
"204987124-0-57061";"What's my part of the plan?"
"204987124-0-57062";"Vole."
"204987124-0-57063";"What's the hurry?"
"204987124-0-57064";"How is the Wrathstone connected to this place?"
"204987124-0-57065";"What's Sereyne's part of the plan?"
"204987124-0-57066";"What's Vole doing?"
"204987124-0-57067";"Can you go over the plan, again?"
"204987124-0-57068";"What's Vole doing?"
"204987124-0-57069";"Let's go over your crew's roles."
"204987124-0-57070";"So we've hit a dead end?"
"204987124-0-57071";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-57072";"It sounds like you'll be preparing another expedition soon."
"204987124-0-57073";"Where is Quintus?"
"204987124-0-57074";"Can't you activate the relic yourself?"
"204987124-0-57077";"Not exactly. The Betrayer set the moons in motion. When they align, the Dragons can reach the Core."
"204987124-0-57078";"There must be a way to stop the eclipse."
"204987124-0-57080";"We need to get her back to Rimmen."
"204987124-0-57082";"Are you the only member of your clan opposed to harming travelers?"
"204987124-0-57083";"Why were you living in a burial site?"
"204987124-0-57084";"Special locks?"
"204987124-0-57085";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-57095";"I can't help but notice your name. Is it Akaviri?"
"204987124-0-57096";"How so?"
"204987124-0-57098";"What can be done?"
"204987124-0-57100";"I'll kill the Nereid."
"204987124-0-57102";"All right, I'll head to Vek-Drassi."
"204987124-0-57105";"Why shouldn't I kill any of the guards?"
"204987124-0-57106";"Where do I need to go, again?"
"204987124-0-57107";"She seems like she had good intentions."
"204987124-0-57109";"Perhaps we should speak to Ishu again?"
"204987124-0-57111";"What does that have to do with your egg-mother's research?"
"204987124-0-57113";"What will you do then?"
"204987124-0-57117";"What are these quotes you keep whispering? About the Whispering Claw?"
"204987124-0-57118";"You were a holy man?"
"204987124-0-57119";"Are you all right after the failed teleportation?"
"204987124-0-57120";"What are the teachings of the Whispering Claw?"
"204987124-0-57121";"What about Nazdar and Vole?"
"204987124-0-57122";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-57123";"Can you move?"
"204987124-0-57125";"Where did you learn about Khajiit anatomy?"
"204987124-0-57126";"Will you be safe here?"
"204987124-0-57127";"You're certain you can help Nazdar?"
"204987124-0-57128";"You can keep things quiet?"
"204987124-0-57130";"Tell me more about this enforcer."
"204987124-0-57132";"What did they say?"
"204987124-0-57135";"But you grandfather's writ was for Proconsul Beloren-Kaie, not Feina-Darak."
"204987124-0-57136";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-57137";"Why were you exiled?"
"204987124-0-57140";"An honest living?"
"204987124-0-57141";"Why not stick together?"
"204987124-0-57142";"What will happen to your crew?"
"204987124-0-57143";"It sounds like you're taking over."
"204987124-0-57144";"But she didn't do anything. It was her ancestor who stole your identity."
"204987124-0-57145";"Does this have anything to do with Frostvault and Garlas Malatar?"
"204987124-0-57146";"The Wrathstone?"
"204987124-0-57148";"But you weren't successful?"
"204987124-0-57149";"That seems like a technicality."
"204987124-0-57150";"Tell me about the Morag Tong."
"204987124-0-57151";"But you're going to have the town guards search?"
"204987124-0-57152";"I see. Tell me about Hakoshae."
"204987124-0-57153";"I'll meet you inside Wormroot Depths."
"204987124-0-57155";"I'll see you at the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-57157";"You had an impossible decision to make. You don't deserve to be judged for it."
"204987124-0-57159";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-57160";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-57161";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-57162";"So, what happened?"
"204987124-0-57163";"So, what happened?"
"204987124-0-57164";"Who's Khasda?"
"204987124-0-57165";"And Tasnasi?"
"204987124-0-57166";"What can you tell me about the Stitches?"
"204987124-0-57167";"I'd like to know who I'll be working with."
"204987124-0-57168";"Why is it in ruins now?"
"204987124-0-57169";"Your egg-mother was in Cicatrice?"
"204987124-0-57170";"So they abandoned the town?"
"204987124-0-57171";"I need more details about what happened to your companions."
"204987124-0-57172";"If you believe your egg-mother died, why come to Cicatrice?"
"204987124-0-57173";"Tell me more about Cicatrice."
"204987124-0-57174";"That was the Betrayer, Cadwell, not you."
"204987124-0-57175";"And the rest of your group?"
"204987124-0-57176";"Argonian blood? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-57177";"Tell me more about Cicatrice."
"204987124-0-57178";"Liberate Rimmen?"
"204987124-0-57180";"All right, tell me more about these surges of power."
"204987124-0-57181";"I'll see you at the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-57182";"So help us fix this, Cadwell. Help us stop the Dragons from reaching Jode's Core."
"204987124-0-57183";"Tell me more about the Dragons."
"204987124-0-57184";"Tell me about Euraxia Tharn."
"204987124-0-57187";"Powerful words, but it sounds risky."
"204987124-0-57188";"You have a pendant that's connected to Jode?"
"204987124-0-57190";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-57191";"Sounds good."
"204987124-0-57193";"I will."
"204987124-0-57198";"And so they tainted the Nereid as well."
"204987124-0-57199";"You said you're a priest of Two Moons. What is that?"
"204987124-0-57200";"So killing the Nereid will heal the oasis?"
"204987124-0-57203";"Will the priests just do anything she asks them to?"
"204987124-0-57205";"When did your Moon-Bishop start having visions?"
"204987124-0-57206";"When did your Moon-Bishop start having visions?"
"204987124-0-57207";"It sounds like they're under some sort of spell."
"204987124-0-57208";"Where is M'zum's Fragrant Moons Plantation?"
"204987124-0-57209";"You really think Euraxia will attack the city?"
"204987124-0-57210";"I'll go find Khamira."
"204987124-0-57211";"Can you actually hold out against Euraxia's forces?"
"204987124-0-57214";"What's your plan for saving Vazbi?"
"204987124-0-57217";"But why Dragons in particular? And not, say, Dremora. Or mudcrabs?"
"204987124-0-57220";"What will happen to the oasis now?"
"204987124-0-57221";"Why can't it be cleansed now?"
"204987124-0-57222";"Then why did I kill the Nereid?"
"204987124-0-57223";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-57224";"How are your companions?"
"204987124-0-57227";"I'll report to Khamira."
"204987124-0-57230";"What sort of tragedy?"
"204987124-0-57232";"But you have doubts."
"204987124-0-57233";"Devourer?"
"204987124-0-57234";"That's a cryptic answer to a simple question."
"204987124-0-57235";"Why would Grundwulf join her?"
"204987124-0-57237";"What if I can't find this fork, assuming it exists?"
"204987124-0-57239";"He said the priests were in danger. In his own cryptic way. This is all a game to him."
"204987124-0-57240";"What are you hiding from?"
"204987124-0-57241";"You think this smell is going to lead me to the fork?"
"204987124-0-57242";"I encountered an odd character after I rescued Zargha. I think he's responsible for this."
"204987124-0-57243";"What's your sacred mission?"
"204987124-0-57244";"What's wrong with you?"
"204987124-0-57246";"Why do they think this smelly fork will help them hide from Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57247";"I'll speak with him."
"204987124-0-57250";"So that's why you're creating an antidote."
"204987124-0-57251";"I thought the attunement gave you the power to move the moons."
"204987124-0-57252";"Euraxia knew you had the Wrathstone and would bring it here. But why does she want you dead?"
"204987124-0-57254";"You aren't the Cadwell I know."
"204987124-0-57256";"You're the Betrayer mentioned on the gravestone?"
"204987124-0-57262";"The surviving Desert Wind adepts are coming to help defend the city."
"204987124-0-57264";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-57267";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-57268";"How does that make the mage more powerful?"
"204987124-0-57269";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-57270";"Can you tell me more about this Temple of the Hidden Moon?"
"204987124-0-57271";"Do you know any liches?"
"204987124-0-57275";"Why do you follow Peryite?"
"204987124-0-57277";"He appeared as a small cat."
"204987124-0-57278";"Is that how he's been driving the priests insane?"
"204987124-0-57279";"It's probably best that you hang onto it."
"204987124-0-57280";"You think I can reason with her?"
"204987124-0-57283";"What are you going to do with the fork I brought you?"
"204987124-0-57284";"The Lattice?"
"204987124-0-57285";"You aren't to blame for this death, Zamarak."
"204987124-0-57287";"What are the Sands Behind the Stars?"
"204987124-0-57288";"You aren't to blame for this death, Zamarak."
"204987124-0-57289";"What's the story behind the Skooma Cat?"
"204987124-0-57290";"What's the story behind the Skooma Cat?"
"204987124-0-57292";"Peryite is powerful."
"204987124-0-57294";"What was Grundwulf doing with his voice? Magic?"
"204987124-0-57295";"You don't believe him?"
"204987124-0-57298";"This is about what happened in the Halls of Colossus, right?"
"204987124-0-57300";"Tell me about these hunters I'm hunting."
"204987124-0-57301";"Where can I find Cadwell?"
"204987124-0-57302";"I'll go help Cadwell."
"204987124-0-57304";"You said they kill people as well as beasts?"
"204987124-0-57305";"Who are you, anyway?"
"204987124-0-57306";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-57307";"You really think the Betrayer's head can see through your eyes?"
"204987124-0-57309";"Tell me more about Peryite."
"204987124-0-57312";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-57313";"Who are you, anyway?"
"204987124-0-57314";"Tell me more about Dragonhorn Tower."
"204987124-0-57315";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-57316";"Tell me about the dictated letter you found."
"204987124-0-57319";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-57321";"Have you seen a cultist named Marthine?"
"204987124-0-57326";"So how can I help?"
"204987124-0-57327";"Any idea what lies ahead?"
"204987124-0-57328";"More than Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57329";"I'll keep an eye out for any research notes."
"204987124-0-57330";"How can we avoid it?"
"204987124-0-57331";"Did you find Grundwulf?"
"204987124-0-57332";"You mean kill him?"
"204987124-0-57333";"What can you tell me about Nisaazda?"
"204987124-0-57334";"Could you really kill your friend?"
"204987124-0-57336";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-57338";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-57339";"Fine. I agree."
"204987124-0-57340";"What can you tell me about these cultists?"
"204987124-0-57341";"So you operate the siegecraft, too?"
"204987124-0-57342";"You think it would be catastrophic?"
"204987124-0-57343";"Are you and Hadaz miners?"
"204987124-0-57344";"Why would the Euraxians arrest one of their own officers?"
"204987124-0-57345";"Where are they holding Prefect Calo?"
"204987124-0-57347";"All right. I'll try to find Prefect Calo."
"204987124-0-57348";"Mazdurr the Moonstruck?"
"204987124-0-57349";"All right. Can you explain how you ended up in these caverns?"
"204987124-0-57350";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-57351";"And you went along with that?"
"204987124-0-57352";"If Arum-Khal's orbs and the sword are gates between realms, where do they lead?"
"204987124-0-57354";"Tell me about Captain Saulinia."
"204987124-0-57357";"You mentioned the Khajiit were trying to liberate Rimmen."
"204987124-0-57358";"You mentioned Lord Gharesh-ri and Khamira. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-57359";"Seems that way."
"204987124-0-57361";"That's the plan. I'll be back soon."
"204987124-0-57362";"Gharesh-ri returned from battle and went to see the healers. What do you mean, what happens next?"
"204987124-0-57363";"You mentioned Lord Gharesh-ri and Khamira. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-57364";"What about the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57366";"She's the only surviving daughter of King Hemakar. Doesn't that make her the queen?"
"204987124-0-57367";"I'll go find Khamira and let her know."
"204987124-0-57370";"The report suggests the last Dragonguard is hiding in an Akaviri shrine in the Scar."
"204987124-0-57372";"The eclipse? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-57373";"And then what happens?"
"204987124-0-57377";"You must have some idea where this hidden Akaviri shrine is located."
"204987124-0-57381";"How do I know I can trust you?"
"204987124-0-57382";"What is the sacred sugar you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-57383";"How would a dangerous drug help you?"
"204987124-0-57384";"What did you see in your real vision?"
"204987124-0-57385";"How'd you manage that?"
"204987124-0-57386";"Why do you want this Marzula-jo's notes?"
"204987124-0-57389";"Isn't that necromancy?"
"204987124-0-57390";"You'd be bringing a dead thing back to life. That sounds like necromancy."
"204987124-0-57391";"You mentioned Caldathir again. Who is he, exactly?"
"204987124-0-57397";"Why didn't the Mane come to crown Khamira personally?"
"204987124-0-57398";"Do you think we can trust Prefect Calo?"
"204987124-0-57399";"I hope we're not making a mistake here."
"204987124-0-57400";"A temple to what?"
"204987124-0-57401";"What did you see in your real vision?"
"204987124-0-57402";"Why does Sheogorath become the Skooma Cat?"
"204987124-0-57403";"Did you know that Khamira is the rightful heir to the Rimmen throne?"
"204987124-0-57404";"Did you find anything while searching the manor?"
"204987124-0-57406";"So, did you and Gharesh-ri come up with a plan on how to deal with Euraxia?"
"204987124-0-57407";"Can you tell me the tale?"
"204987124-0-57408";"Sounds like there's a story there."
"204987124-0-57409";"How are Khajiit related to Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57410";"Does Alkosh not have many worshipers?"
"204987124-0-57421";"How did he woo her?"
"204987124-0-57422";"How was that suppose to woo her?"
"204987124-0-57423";"But what does that have to do with your thief leaving a clue behind?"
"204987124-0-57424";"Tell me more about the mural you were restoring."
"204987124-0-57425";"Why do you want to restore the mural now?"
"204987124-0-57426";"You told me the thief left a clue. Don't you find that strange?"
"204987124-0-57429";"Don't you want to be there when Khamira's crowned queen?"
"204987124-0-57430";"I have a letter for you. It's from the Mane."
"204987124-0-57432";"Good luck, Tharn."
"204987124-0-57433";"I'm ready to spar."
"204987124-0-57435";"They beat the worshipers?"
"204987124-0-57436";"Why dedicate this shrine to Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-0-57437";"Do you know where the Dragon went?"
"204987124-0-57443";"After Euraxia conquered Rimmen, why didn't you become a spy like your wife Zaima?"
"204987124-0-57444";"Acquired?"
"204987124-0-57445";"So you became the keeper of this shrine?"
"204987124-0-57446";"Why dedicate this shrine to Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-0-57447";"Tell me about Zaima."
"204987124-0-57448";"You never thought to contact Aneshi before this?"
"204987124-0-57449";"Should you be wandering the countryside by yourself, Queen Khamira?"
"204987124-0-57450";"Tell me about Zaima."
"204987124-0-57451";"So Aneshi was a Khunzar-ri scholar?"
"204987124-0-57453";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-57454";"Aren't Euraxians also Imperials?"
"204987124-0-57456";"Then why don't these Imperials do something?"
"204987124-0-57461";"Why did Euraxia attack Rimmen?"
"204987124-0-57462";"Different aspects? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-57463";"How did you survive the execution of the royal family?"
"204987124-0-57464";"And how does collecting mural pieces help with all that?"
"204987124-0-57465";"Didn't I already prove myself at the Falinesti Winter Site? I certainly bested you then."
"204987124-0-57466";"What will happen now that sanity is restored?"
"204987124-0-57467";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-57468";"That desire trapped a High Elf woman in a frozen crypt for centuries."
"204987124-0-57469";"So what aspect of Rajhin are you?"
"204987124-0-57470";"All right. But you did promise you'd tell me why you stole the mural pieces in the first place."
"204987124-0-57471";"So we're the strike force. What about Gharesh-ri and the rest of the militia?"
"204987124-0-57472";"What are you going to be doing while Nala-do, Khamira, and I deal with the siege weapons?"
"204987124-0-57474";"Will the priests continue to follow her after this?"
"204987124-0-57475";"There's only a single soldier guarding the south weapons platform?"
"204987124-0-57477";"Was anyone else harmed?"
"204987124-0-57483";"All right, I'll go set fire to the siege weapons on the south platform."
"204987124-0-57484";"Sweet rotmeth brew?"
"204987124-0-57485";"I'm afraid I'll have to pass on that."
"204987124-0-57496";"What happened at the other sites you visited before you found this gravestone?"
"204987124-0-57504";"Sure, I saw a Breton. He ran toward the crafting stalls."
"204987124-0-57508";"But you didn't know anything, right?"
"204987124-0-57509";"So, Tu'heiba hired you to find this Jewel of Baan Dar? Tell me about it."
"204987124-0-57510";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-57511";"And when I find out where Tu'heiba is, then what?"
"204987124-0-57512";"How does all this lead to you falling out a window?"
"204987124-0-57513";"You mean to pay a ransom?"
"204987124-0-57514";"We'll find them."
"204987124-0-57515";"Why would Tu'heiba want you to steal a sacred Khajiit jewel?"
"204987124-0-57516";"So, how did all this end up with you falling out of a window?"
"204987124-0-57517";"If you successfully stole it, why is Tu'heiba mad at you?"
"204987124-0-57518";"Why doesn't he just tell you in person?"
"204987124-0-57519";"How did all this lead to you falling out a window?"
"204987124-0-57520";"But you weren't able to stop Euraxia from killing the royal family."
"204987124-0-57521";"Tell me about you time as the King's Claw."
"204987124-0-57522";"Did Abnur Tharn present Prefect Calo to Khamira?"
"204987124-0-57525";"At least you were able to get Khamira to safety."
"204987124-0-57526";"What should I know before we enter the Scar?"
"204987124-0-57528";"Tell me about your time as the King's Claw."
"204987124-0-57529";"You mentioned the legends of Khunzar-ri."
"204987124-0-57530";"Looks like you won a lot of gold while I was gone."
"204987124-0-57531";"All right. I'll deliver the gold and meet you when I have Fez'skar."
"204987124-0-57532";"Where should we meet once I have Fez'skar?"
"204987124-0-57534";"It still seems wrong."
"204987124-0-57535";"How will this stone help you summon a spirit?"
"204987124-0-57536";"How do you know he was cheating?"
"204987124-0-57538";"Very well. I'll be going now."
"204987124-0-57539";"And if we defeat him?"
"204987124-0-57542";"And if we're the victors?"
"204987124-0-57543";"Will you accept this gold for Fez'skar or not?"
"204987124-0-57547";"[Give Ransom] You have a deal. Now, where's Fez'skar?"
"204987124-0-57549";"I gave you the gold. Can you translate this or not?"
"204987124-0-57550";"What does it say?"
"204987124-0-57551";"Thanks. I'm off to the Tangle, I guess."
"204987124-0-57558";"You think finding him will be a challenge?"
"204987124-0-57560";"All right, I'll meet you at the Tangle."
"204987124-0-57561";"Pelinal was killing Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-57562";"Why did you step on a spike trap?"
"204987124-0-57563";"Calm down. Is there any way to disarm the spike plate?"
"204987124-0-57565";"All right, sit tight. I'll go find this key."
"204987124-0-57566";"I'll go find Abnur Tharn."
"204987124-0-57568";"You helped bring the killer of the royal family of Anequina to justice."
"204987124-0-57569";"Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire, Zamarak."
"204987124-0-57570";"I need to know more about the person I'm working with."
"204987124-0-57571";"Did you ever try to forgive and redeem Arum-Khal?"
"204987124-0-57572";"What were the signs you missed?"
"204987124-0-57575";"Provisionally?"
"204987124-0-57576";"Not yet. Tell us where you hid the Jewel of Baan Dar, first."
"204987124-0-57577";"Fine. I'll get you out of there."
"204987124-0-57578";"Hold still while I get you out of there."
"204987124-0-57580";"The Dragonguard gave me a key to his sanctuary. We were on our way to retrieve a Dragonhorn."
"204987124-0-57583";"So you believe the Dragonguard once fought Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57585";"What's the story behind this Moonlight Blade?"
"204987124-0-57586";"Mazza-Mirri said it will help us defeat Arum-Khal. How, exactly?"
"204987124-0-57587";"You think that's where he went?"
"204987124-0-57588";"I'll retrieve the package, but what about your stolen honey?"
"204987124-0-57589";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-57591";"To the Stitches, then."
"204987124-0-57592";"What is your relationship to Azura, anyway?"
"204987124-0-57593";"So, you and Mazza-Mirri know each other?"
"204987124-0-57594";"And your order was devoted to her in particular?"
"204987124-0-57595";"Has she just been waiting all this time like you?"
"204987124-0-57596";"He's that popular?"
"204987124-0-57597";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-0-57598";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-57600";"It's still illegal though, right?"
"204987124-0-57601";"So, the Hidden Moon adepts practiced necromancy?"
"204987124-0-57602";"Earn their way how?"
"204987124-0-57603";"Why didn't you use it against Arum-Khal the first time?"
"204987124-0-57604";"Why what?"
"204987124-0-57606";"Is his escape related to those orbs? The phylacteries?"
"204987124-0-57610";"Your powers—you mean necromancy?"
"204987124-0-57611";"Tell me more about the Moonlight Blade."
"204987124-0-57612";"To the Crossing? What is that?"
"204987124-0-57613";"Nobody can make that jump, Jakarn. Fez'skar just died trying!"
"204987124-0-57616";"Are you sure you're up to this?"
"204987124-0-57617";"Stop this! Think about Lerisa—about your friends! They don't want you dead!"
"204987124-0-57619";"There you go. Step back from the cliff."
"204987124-0-57620";"There you go. Step back from the cliff."
"204987124-0-57621";"There you go. Step back from the cliff."
"204987124-0-57622";"What pushed him over the edge?"
"204987124-0-57623";"Tell me more about the Moonlight Blade."
"204987124-0-57624";"That's when he became a lich?"
"204987124-0-57626";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-57627";"So the jewel drives people crazy?"
"204987124-0-57629";"Speaking of Jakarn, are you still angry with him?"
"204987124-0-57635";"I heard Euraxia mention a Moon Gate to the southwest. That seemed to be of interest to Kaalgrontiid."
"204987124-0-57637";"I'll help Abnur Tharn determine the significance of Euraxia's final order."
"204987124-0-57638";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-57639";"You sound upset."
"204987124-0-57641";"All right, let's keep going."
"204987124-0-57648";"And this Dragonhorn is different?"
"204987124-0-57652";"You made them vampires?"
"204987124-0-57653";"If your clan has always been peaceful, why does Rakazsa want them to attack travelers?"
"204987124-0-57654";"How do you survive if you don't feed?"
"204987124-0-57658";"You said that Silhu-jo found you on his doorstep?"
"204987124-0-57659";"Maybe Khamira or Gharesh-ri can tell us about this Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-57663";"You made them vampires?"
"204987124-0-57664";"What sort of tragedy?"
"204987124-0-57665";"How dangerous is he?"
"204987124-0-57666";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-57667";"Your duty to the dead?"
"204987124-0-57668";"You mentioned the Sands Behind the Stars before. What is that?"
"204987124-0-57669";"Why were you living in a burial site?"
"204987124-0-57672";"A Dragon helped the undead your necromancer unleashed on the Khajiiti Defense Force."
"204987124-0-57673";"But you will recover, right?"
"204987124-0-57676";"Good luck in your pursuit."
"204987124-0-57678";"Couldn't you take Rakazsa's place as leader and make peace, like your old Clan Mother?"
"204987124-0-57679";"What other cases have you worked on in Riverhold?"
"204987124-0-57680";"And what's next for you, Thunderboots?"
"204987124-0-57681";"Did you solve the case?"
"204987124-0-57685";"His name is Zumog Phoom. He's involved with Euraxia and the Dragons plaguing Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-57686";"Is there anywhere you can go besides the street?"
"204987124-0-57689";"Here, I hope this helps."
"204987124-0-57691";"You want me to be your valet?"
"204987124-0-57693";"All right, I'll meet you in Rimmen."
"204987124-0-57695";"I'm no slave to my thirst."
"204987124-0-57696";"And you sent for me to help you against the Dragons."
"204987124-0-57697";"Anything else I need to know?"
"204987124-0-57699";"Tell me about Cadwell the Betrayer."
"204987124-0-57700";"How did you become a vampire?"
"204987124-0-57701";"How did you become a vampire?"
"204987124-0-57703";"This is goodbye then."
"204987124-0-57705";"Another matter?"
"204987124-0-57712";"I'm ready. [Travel to Sugar-Slinger's Den]"
"204987124-0-57716";"Take me to Elden Root in the Aldmeri Dominion."
"204987124-0-57721";"Let's get moving. [Travel to Elsweyr]"
"204987124-0-57725";"I'll gather honey flowers, but what about the missing minstrels?"
"204987124-0-57727";"Got it. I'll get the package, pick honey flowers, and search for the minstrels."
"204987124-0-57728";"There's a delivery fee?"
"204987124-0-57729";"How much was the fee?"
"204987124-0-57730";"Yes, here's your gold for the delivery fee."
"204987124-0-57734";"Yes, here's your gold for the delivery fee."
"204987124-0-57735";"Here's your package. I'll get the honey flowers next."
"204987124-0-57737";"Here's your package. I'll get the honey flowers next."
"204987124-0-57739";"Does the museum really need donations?"
"204987124-0-57740";"I'll place the Singing Crystal then."
"204987124-0-57741";"If you say so. Is there anything else I can do?"
"204987124-0-57743";"I'll find Asaldak, and invite him to your tasting."
"204987124-0-57744";"I'll tell Rigurt that you'll meet him at Merryvale Farms."
"204987124-0-57745";"Well, Asaldak is on his way. I'll search for the Screaming Mammoths in Valenwood Gate next."
"204987124-0-57747";"Is there any reason why these smugglers may have targeted your family?"
"204987124-0-57749";"Mizzik and I will find Zinthia. We're getting close."
"204987124-0-57751";"I'll arm the traps along the road."
"204987124-0-57752";"Rigurt sent me. He's expecting you to perform in Rimmen."
"204987124-0-57753";"Why did Alkosh come here?"
"204987124-0-57754";"Rigurt needs you to play for Lady Izza to gain her favor."
"204987124-0-57756";"I'll gather the instruments, and bring them to Rigurt."
"204987124-0-57757";"Baandari?"
"204987124-0-57758";"The locals don't mind you parking your wagons here?"
"204987124-0-57760";"If you don't get along with these house-born Khajiit, why are you here?"
"204987124-0-57762";"But how is a Cat a Dragon?"
"204987124-0-57763";"Did Alkosh unleash Dragons on Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-57764";"Moon-sugar makes you sick?"
"204987124-0-57766";"Do you think Euraxia's troops are interested in soup recipes?"
"204987124-0-57768";"You brought a peace offering for Rigurt?"
"204987124-0-57769";"Do you usually reward people with collars and bells?"
"204987124-0-57771";"I'll make sure Rigurt understands what an honor this is."
"204987124-0-57772";"You said he's the Dragon King of Cats? What's that mean?"
"204987124-0-57773";"And this is where Alkosh stopped him?"
"204987124-0-57774";"They ate too much moon-sugar, and want us to play in their place."
"204987124-0-57775";"This is real. If you want the lute, I'll take the drum."
"204987124-0-57777";"Sure, I'll grab the drum."
"204987124-0-57778";"Does Zinthia like all these cats, too?"
"204987124-0-57779";"You said he's the Dragon King of Cats? What's that mean?"
"204987124-0-57780";"Guide them how?"
"204987124-0-57783";"A certain High Elf noble? Perhaps Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-57784";"So you were jealous of Zinthia."
"204987124-0-57785";"So, Hircine will make you stronger?"
"204987124-0-57786";"That sounds pretty jealous."
"204987124-0-57788";"What's it made from?"
"204987124-0-57789";"We found moldy moon-sugar earlier. Mizzik seemed particularly panicked."
"204987124-0-57791";"A Daedra heart?"
"204987124-0-57793";"So the smugglers were going to make skooma out of the moldy moon-sugar?"
"204987124-0-57794";"What about your daughter Rideza?"
"204987124-0-57795";"Their fires?"
"204987124-0-57797";"You have no desire to be reunited with Rideza?"
"204987124-0-57799";"If you say so. Should I be on the lookout for anything in the Tangle?"
"204987124-0-57801";"And he's at Sunspire Temple now?"
"204987124-0-57804";"How can I get to the chancel?"
"204987124-0-57805";"Where can I find these other Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57806";"You don't believe that was Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-57807";"Was that really the ghost of Euraxia Tharn?"
"204987124-0-57808";"So you're going to let Zumog Phoom win? You're going to fail again?"
"204987124-0-57809";"Do you know where Zamarak was taken?"
"204987124-0-57810";"The Euraxians controlled Riverhold in the past, right?"
"204987124-0-57812";"I'll go help Captain Nala-do with the supply camps now."
"204987124-0-57813";"You've been luring people into bondage."
"204987124-0-57814";"I'm not going to hurt you unless you attack me like the others."
"204987124-0-57815";"Little lattice?"
"204987124-0-57816";"You believe Jone and Jode are here too?"
"204987124-0-57817";"And how does the Dark Behind the World fit in?"
"204987124-0-57818";"What else can I do?"
"204987124-0-57819";"I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-57821";"I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-57822";"If you won't believe me. Come see what your god has to say for himself."
"204987124-0-57824";"You could always stay."
"204987124-0-57825";"What are you going to tell people about me?"
"204987124-0-57826";"What will you do, now that you're free from the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-57828";"What will you do with Azin-jo?"
"204987124-0-57829";"What will you do with Azin-jo?"
"204987124-0-57830";"How long have you been a priest of Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-57831";"What did he want?"
"204987124-0-57832";"You have this temple."
"204987124-0-57833";"How did the Dragon convince you he was Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-57834";"Why was that?"
"204987124-0-57835";"How will your temple recover from this?"
"204987124-0-57836";"How will your temple recover from this?"
"204987124-0-57837";"Why don't you offer and see?"
"204987124-0-57838";"How will your temple recover from this?"
"204987124-0-57839";"The Dragon spoke to that rift?"
"204987124-0-57840";"Fair enough. How does the whistle work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-57845";"What do you think changed you?"
"204987124-0-57846";"Have you had any more visions through the eyes of your severed head?"
"204987124-0-57847";"Why can't you just teleport all of us into the palace?"
"204987124-0-57848";"So why risk it?"
"204987124-0-57849";"That sounds like a lot of wishful thinking."
"204987124-0-57851";"Who is this Shalani you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-57852";"Can you tell me more about your faith?"
"204987124-0-57853";"How so?"
"204987124-0-57854";"Tell me about Sunspire."
"204987124-0-57855";"You said <<1>> offers jobs that require multiple warriors?"
"204987124-0-57856";"Tell me about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-57857";"What's the Khajiiti Defense Force?"
"204987124-0-57858";"Why do you want this Marzula-jo's notes?"
"204987124-0-57859";"What do you mean, this is all Abnur Tharn's fault?"
"204987124-0-57861";"You stole Malacath's hammer?"
"204987124-0-57862";"Where is Volendrung now?"
"204987124-0-57864";"All right. I'll visit Cheesemonger's Hollow."
"204987124-0-57865";"What's the significance of Anequina?"
"204987124-0-57866";"Do you think this really has something to do with the legends of Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-0-57867";"Is the Dragonhorn part of the story?"
"204987124-0-57868";"Can you tell me anything else about the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-57869";"A gift?"
"204987124-0-57870";"You think something happened to Zamarak and Calo?"
"204987124-0-57871";"Cadwell, what are you seeing? Where is Zumog Phoom?"
"204987124-0-57874";"Cadwell, wait!"
"204987124-0-57876";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-57877";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-57879";"Why not simply deal with the soldiers and be done with it?"
"204987124-0-57881";"Something related to the undead?"
"204987124-0-57882";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-57883";"All right, I'll place these descrying stones."
"204987124-0-57884";"You serve Azura? Like, the Daedric Prince, Azura?"
"204987124-0-57885";"And the Khajiit worship her too?"
"204987124-0-57886";"You think she'll lie to us?"
"204987124-0-57891";"Wait, you're going to raise him from the dead?"
"204987124-0-57893";"So if we learn about these Hidden Moon adepts, we might find the source of the awakening?"
"204987124-0-57895";"The Lunar Lattice?"
"204987124-0-57896";"But why are you being attuned?"
"204987124-0-57897";"What were those guardians we encountered?"
"204987124-0-57899";"How can the Betrayer move the Moons?"
"204987124-0-57901";"Why did the Betrayer turn on Khunzar-ri and the champions?"
"204987124-0-57904";"We saw the past, but where's the real Betrayer?"
"204987124-0-57909";"So now what?"
"204987124-0-57913";"The Frostfall Coup?"
"204987124-0-57914";"And everyone just let her do that?"
"204987124-0-57915";"Can I get rid of Volendrung after I pick it up?"
"204987124-0-57917";"I don't want to trade my soul for power."
"204987124-0-57918";"Can I get rid of Volendrung after I pick it up?"
"204987124-0-57920";"I don't want to trade my soul for power."
"204987124-0-57921";"Do you plan on acquiring more greater artifacts?"
"204987124-0-57922";"Can I use Volendrung again?"
"204987124-0-57923";"Can I use Volendrung again?"
"204987124-0-57925";"How will this stone help you summon a spirit?"
"204987124-0-57926";"Is there anything else I need to do?"
"204987124-0-57927";"How does this work, anyway? Are you raising him from the dead?"
"204987124-0-57932";"What'd she do?"
"204987124-0-57933";"What's your story?"
"204987124-0-57935";"Do you like living alongside the Euraxians?"
"204987124-0-57936";"How should I get rid of the wasps?"
"204987124-0-57939";"Well, they must not have burned everything."
"204987124-0-57940";"I'll find you something better to eat."
"204987124-0-57944";"This guar belongs to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-57946";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-57948";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-57950";"I'll figure something out."
"204987124-0-57952";"Does she have any identifying features?"
"204987124-0-57954";"And there's no one you suspect? Or perhaps someone who may have seen what happened?"
"204987124-0-57957";"You deal with the apparatus, I'll take care of the Betrayer."
"204987124-0-57958";"I found a dead body."
"204987124-0-57960";"The wine bottles are cursed?"
"204987124-0-57961";"Seems odd that such a large keg went missing."
"204987124-0-57968";"What tenets do Goutfangs have?"
"204987124-0-57969";"Tsaesci?"
"204987124-0-57971";"How is that possible?"
"204987124-0-57972";"That's enough to justify killing them?"
"204987124-0-57973";"Are you going to be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-57974";"Any idea where we can find these keys?"
"204987124-0-57981";"Why do you say it like that?"
"204987124-0-57982";"Are you comfortable with destroying a soul like Arum-Khal's?"
"204987124-0-57983";"What do you think would happen if we failed?"
"204987124-0-57987";"Your condition?"
"204987124-0-57988";"Should I be worried?"
"204987124-0-57991";"Do you know the significance of the name? The Hidden Moon?"
"204987124-0-57992";"Can you tell me more about liches?"
"204987124-0-57993";"Something related to Azura?"
"204987124-0-57994";"A dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-57995";"Can you tell me more about liches?"
"204987124-0-57996";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-57997";"What is the ja-Kha'jay, again?"
"204987124-0-57999";"What will happen to his soul when we defeat him?"
"204987124-0-58001";"What's going to happen to the crew?"
"204987124-0-58002";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-58003";"Is there no way for you to escape with us?"
"204987124-0-58007";"Strong will and farewell, Shando-ri."
"204987124-0-58008";"You're going to steal to pay Fez'skar's ransom?"
"204987124-0-58009";"So, is there a reason you can't trek through the sewer yourself?"
"204987124-0-58010";"What about the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-58012";"I'll gather our allies."
"204987124-0-58013";"Do you know where they are now?"
"204987124-0-58014";"Are you sure you don't want to play with the yarn?"
"204987124-0-58016";"There must be something around here you'll be interested in."
"204987124-0-58018";"There must be something you'll like."
"204987124-0-58020";"Fine. I'll find the slave trader's ledger in the Darkpool Mine."
"204987124-0-58021";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-58022";"Why are you willing to sell a fellow Khajiit into slavery?"
"204987124-0-58023";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-58024";"Must I steal the items you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-58028";"Very well. Tell me more about the Akaviri Potentate."
"204987124-0-58030";"If it's not a tradition, why did Hakoshae decide to have the festival now?"
"204987124-0-58031";"Very well. Tell me about the Proof of Wisdom."
"204987124-0-58034";"Why will these items please Rajhin?"
"204987124-0-58037";"The Usurper Queen?"
"204987124-0-58038";"Where did the man with the pot on his head go?"
"204987124-0-58040";"Right, I'll just go and find the man with the pot on his head."
"204987124-0-58041";"So you're going to continue to be the Magnate?"
"204987124-0-58043";"Tell me more about Rajhin."
"204987124-0-58044";"Can you perform blessings and other services?"
"204987124-0-58045";"What's wrong with you?"
"204987124-0-58046";"Why do you follow Peryite?"
"204987124-0-58047";"I saw that bantam guar rummaging around in a foul-smelling sack at one site."
"204987124-0-58048";"Why do you think you had a dream about this gravestone?"
"204987124-0-58049";"And did you also dispatch the ogrim I found at one of the sites?"
"204987124-0-58051";"I thought it would be something more noticeable."
"204987124-0-58052";"I'd like a blessing."
"204987124-0-58053";"I'd like a blessing too."
"204987124-0-58054";"To Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-58055";"I meant something to help me be a better thief."
"204987124-0-58056";"Why do you worship Azura instead of the Divines?"
"204987124-0-58057";"That seems to upset you."
"204987124-0-58058";"Fair enough. I'm ready to set out now."
"204987124-0-58059";"Fair enough. I'm ready to set out."
"204987124-0-58060";"That's right. You serve the Daedric Prince, Azura, right?"
"204987124-0-58061";"Why do you worship Azura instead of the Divines, again?"
"204987124-0-58062";"And the Khajiit worship her too?"
"204987124-0-58063";"All right. I'm ready to set out."
"204987124-0-58064";"That seems to upset you."
"204987124-0-58065";"There's a first time for everything. You can try Rigurt's sweetbread at Merryvale Farms."
"204987124-0-58071";"All right. How about a sermon, while I'm here?"
"204987124-0-58072";"What did he do?"
"204987124-0-58073";"And she agreed?"
"204987124-0-58074";"Rajhin kissed a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-58075";"He stole her ring?"
"204987124-0-58076";"Daedra?"
"204987124-0-58077";"How'd he get out of that?"
"204987124-0-58078";"And she agreed?"
"204987124-0-58079";"Who did he choose?"
"204987124-0-58080";"Rajhin kissed a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-58081";"He stole her ring?"
"204987124-0-58082";"That seems unwise."
"204987124-0-58083";"The thief made a plan."
"204987124-0-58084";"Thanks for the story. I need something else."
"204987124-0-58085";"Thanks for the story. I need something else."
"204987124-0-58086";"That seems unwise."
"204987124-0-58087";"Only if you keep your hands to yourself."
"204987124-0-58088";"Who did he choose?"
"204987124-0-58089";"How'd he get out of that?"
"204987124-0-58090";"The thief made a plan."
"204987124-0-58091";"The thief made a plan."
"204987124-0-58092";"The thief made a plan."
"204987124-0-58093";"I'd like a blessing."
"204987124-0-58094";"All right, what did Mafala do to the thief?"
"204987124-0-58095";"Zalsheem, the dro-m'Athra."
"204987124-0-58097";"It sounds evil to me."
"204987124-0-58098";"What are these descrying stones, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58099";"What are these descrying stones, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58103";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-58106";"Tell me about the Akaviri."
"204987124-0-58107";"Tell me about the spirit in the tomb."
"204987124-0-58109";"Did you double-cross him, or did he double-cross you?"
"204987124-0-58110";"Remind me why retrieving the Jewel of Baan Dar is so important?"
"204987124-0-58111";"And Fez'skar double-crossed you?"
"204987124-0-58112";"And to find out where Fez'skar hid the jewel, we first have to set him free?"
"204987124-0-58113";"Would you still want to free Fez'skar if you didn't need the jewel?"
"204987124-0-58114";"If your clan has always been peaceful, why does Rakazsa want them to attack travelers?"
"204987124-0-58115";"You didn't want to go on living?"
"204987124-0-58116";"Tell me more about Rakazsa."
"204987124-0-58117";"Cadwell agreed to help, but you should know he's been having some strange dreams."
"204987124-0-58119";"All right. I'll find Rakazsa."
"204987124-0-58121";"Consider seeking out Gharesh-ri. The Speaker of the Mane can help you."
"204987124-0-58122";"Consider seeking out Gharesh-ri. The Speaker of the Mane can help you."
"204987124-0-58123";"All right, I'll try talking to this singing Wood Elf."
"204987124-0-58124";"So you miss Fez'skar even after he got you captured, beaten, and dosed with gas?"
"204987124-0-58125";"Why do you think Fez left the chest on that cliff?"
"204987124-0-58126";"Do you think you'll ever work for Tu'heiba again?"
"204987124-0-58127";"What will you do with the Jewel of Baan dar after you retrieve it?"
"204987124-0-58129";"Are you really going to show Tu'heiba where it is?"
"204987124-0-58131";"So what's next for you, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-58132";"Speaking of your head, what were you thinking when you almost jumped?"
"204987124-0-58135";"Did you know about this power when you hired Fez'skar and Jakarn to steal it?"
"204987124-0-58136";"They need a fork for that?"
"204987124-0-58137";"So you're saying it's Fez's fault you sold him into slavery?"
"204987124-0-58138";"Fine. So, you couldn't beat the location of the jewel out of Fez'skar?"
"204987124-0-58139";"If you catch Jakarn again, do you plan to sell him into slavery too?"
"204987124-0-58141";"Would you still want to free Fez'skar if you didn't need the jewel?"
"204987124-0-58142";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58143";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58144";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58145";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58146";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58147";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58148";"What are they, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58152";"A duality?"
"204987124-0-58154";"Good luck in your pursuit."
"204987124-0-58156";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58157";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58158";"You agreed to this parley. That means we're here under a truce and are free to leave."
"204987124-0-58159";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58160";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58161";"You can't win. We will free Rimmen and drive you out of Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58162";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-58163";"You're saying I should ask your friends about the kind of Khajiit they are?"
"204987124-0-58168";"You allow others to ride you?"
"204987124-0-58169";"So you do. And?"
"204987124-0-58173";"So, you like to scout?"
"204987124-0-58174";"Start? Are you all practitioners of magical arts?"
"204987124-0-58175";"Is there any way to rescue them?"
"204987124-0-58176";"So, you all like to beat up people?"
"204987124-0-58177";"You fight. That's all you do?"
"204987124-0-58179";"I'll get these samples and bring them back to you."
"204987124-0-58182";"All right, I'll go to the Desert Wind Adeptorium."
"204987124-0-58183";"You hear something?"
"204987124-0-58184";"What's in the missing package?"
"204987124-0-58191";"I'll go take care of those supply camps."
"204987124-0-58192";"Tell me more about the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-58193";"So, what actually happened to you at the Shadow Dance Temple?"
"204987124-0-58194";"What does that mean, attuned?"
"204987124-0-58195";"I'll enter the tomb and bring back the relics."
"204987124-0-58196";"Where is the Moon Gate of Anequina?"
"204987124-0-58198";"l'll see you at the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-58199";"So you're still with us?"
"204987124-0-58200";"The Dragonhorn is actually a Dragon's horn?"
"204987124-0-58202";"So how do we use it?"
"204987124-0-58205";"I'll see you at the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-58216";"Why did you name your guar Gordon?"
"204987124-0-58219";"I'll guard the Moon Gate, Khamira."
"204987124-0-58220";"Do you really think the Moonlight Blade can destroy Arum-Khal?"
"204987124-0-58221";"And where do Arum-Khal's orbs lead?"
"204987124-0-58224";"Old times? So this has happened before?"
"204987124-0-58225";"So, if we destroy these Shades, are we destroying parts of Arum-Khal's soul?"
"204987124-0-58229";"But why make her relive that?"
"204987124-0-58231";"Why didn't you help rebuild?"
"204987124-0-58233";"All right. I'll lift the Moonlight Blade."
"204987124-0-58235";"What are you teaching them?"
"204987124-0-58236";"What else do you know about the pantheon?"
"204987124-0-58238";"I'll talk to Abnur Tharn."
"204987124-0-58240";"Who is your master?"
"204987124-0-58243";"Maybe you should start with something more relevant to their situation?"
"204987124-0-58244";"All right, I'll go to the Desert Wind Adeptorium."
"204987124-0-58246";"You think our companions might not have survived the attack on the Moon Gate?"
"204987124-0-58248";"I'll find out what happened to our companions and the soldiers who defended the Moon Gate."
"204987124-0-58249";"It's hard to believe this all started with an ancient Khajiiti legend."
"204987124-0-58250";"So you don't know how the battle ended?"
"204987124-0-58251";"Your injuries, do you need to see the healers?"
"204987124-0-58253";"You defeated the Euraxians?"
"204987124-0-58254";"What will you do now, Zamarak?"
"204987124-0-58256";"What about the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-58258";"The ending of the eclipse was significant?"
"204987124-0-58259";"What will you and the Cygnus Irregulars do now?"
"204987124-0-58261";"What did the Euraxians do then?"
"204987124-0-58262";"So you'll help defend Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-58269";"Good luck, Tharn."
"204987124-0-58272";"I'm ready, Khamira."
"204987124-0-58273";"Are you afraid there will be another Dragon attack?"
"204987124-0-58274";"Let's hope so. What do you think of Khamira?"
"204987124-0-58275";"Another vision?"
"204987124-0-58276";"I see. It sounds like you have a rather personal connection."
"204987124-0-58277";"Is that a threat?"
"204987124-0-58279";"You look fine, don't worry."
"204987124-0-58280";"That's for you to decide."
"204987124-0-58282";"And were you able to patch things up with your family?"
"204987124-0-58283";"Then I guess your days as an agent of the Mane are behind you now?"
"204987124-0-58284";"What does a queen do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58288";"You're really considering going back to Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-58291";"You really learned Khajiiti waltzes?"
"204987124-0-58296";"And how do I go about finding the rest of them?"
"204987124-0-58298";"And she agreed?"
"204987124-0-58299";"Mafala was going to eat the thief."
"204987124-0-58300";"Mafala was going to eat the thief."
"204987124-0-58301";"Mafala was going to eat the thief."
"204987124-0-58302";"And were you able to make a difference?"
"204987124-0-58303";"After everything that happened, you expect me to accept that?"
"204987124-0-58304";"Where have you been since the last time I saw you?"
"204987124-0-58305";"I thought you dedicated yourself to the service of Meridia?"
"204987124-0-58307";"How will that will help us?"
"204987124-0-58308";"And finding this source will allow us to stop the undead?"
"204987124-0-58309";"Does necromantic energy always affect you this way?"
"204987124-0-58310";"I'll take care of it."
"204987124-0-58315";"Why does that bother you?"
"204987124-0-58316";"What can you tell me about this place, the Ashen Scar?"
"204987124-0-58317";"What are these descrying stones, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58321";"Isn't that last bit also a generality?"
"204987124-0-58322";"You said the sword and the phylacteries are both gates. What did you mean?"
"204987124-0-58324";"How does this help all Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-58325";"When do you not fight?"
"204987124-0-58327";"What do you fall back on when you can't fight?"
"204987124-0-58329";"You're a Senche-raht?"
"204987124-0-58330";"Can I ride you?"
"204987124-0-58332";"Do all cat creatures talk? And we just never thought to ask?"
"204987124-0-58335";"May I ride you?"
"204987124-0-58337";"Are you sure you're up to helping us assault the palace?"
"204987124-0-58338";"You still believe this Dragon is Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-58345";"You think Zamarak was the King's Claw?"
"204987124-0-58346";"What have you been up to since I last saw you?"
"204987124-0-58347";"What are you going to be doing while Nala-do, Khamira, and I deal with the siege weapons?"
"204987124-0-58349";"What about the house you were going to build in Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-58350";"Where should I meet Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-0-58352";"Where is M'zum's Fragrant Moons Plantation?"
"204987124-0-58356";"A good queen, Khamira. You're going to do fine."
"204987124-0-58358";"Is there anything specific I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-58359";"Sounds like that didn't end up happening."
"204987124-0-58360";"What should I search for in your mother's cellar?"
"204987124-0-58361";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-58363";"What's the Goiter's Gulp?"
"204987124-0-58364";"The Bowel?"
"204987124-0-58365";"What's the Goiter's Gulp?"
"204987124-0-58367";"Complicated in what way?"
"204987124-0-58368";"What do they want a Moon Gate for?"
"204987124-0-58369";"Remind me, why is Euraxia no longer a problem?"
"204987124-0-58370";"Remind me, why is Euraxia no longer a problem?"
"204987124-0-58371";"Do we know what the Dragons are currently up to?"
"204987124-0-58372";"Captain Nala-do died?"
"204987124-0-58373";"Remind me, why is Euraxia no longer a problem?"
"204987124-0-58374";"So they just left her up there?"
"204987124-0-58377";"What business in the Ashen Scar?"
"204987124-0-58378";"And it was you who stole the mural pieces from the House of Histories."
"204987124-0-58379";"And you can't give me anymore context than these riddles?"
"204987124-0-58380";"And how am I to collect the mural pieces now?"
"204987124-0-58381";"All right. Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-58382";"Can you tell me more about the people I'm recruiting?"
"204987124-0-58383";"I suppose so. Anything else I should watch out for?"
"204987124-0-58384";"Do you think that's likely?"
"204987124-0-58385";"Can you tell me more about the people I'm recruiting?"
"204987124-0-58386";"I see."
"204987124-0-58388";"Didn't Azurah protect you?"
"204987124-0-58394";"Do many Khajiit around here practice necromancy?"
"204987124-0-58396";"If necromancy isn't frowned upon around here, why do you want Thannar dead?"
"204987124-0-58397";"So he's just looking for supplies?"
"204987124-0-58399";"And Pellitine?"
"204987124-0-58400";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-58402";"That seems a little out of character for you."
"204987124-0-58403";"What happened to the Amulet of Kings?"
"204987124-0-58405";"That's not good enough."
"204987124-0-58406";"So the Amulet is safe, at least?"
"204987124-0-58407";"So the Amulet is safe, at least?"
"204987124-0-58408";"So the Amulet is safe, at least?"
"204987124-0-58409";"Where have you been since the last time I saw you?"
"204987124-0-58411";"So they'll have reinforcements, then?"
"204987124-0-58414";"About your half-sister …."
"204987124-0-58418";"But how did it happen?"
"204987124-0-58420";"Where did he and Shando-ri go?"
"204987124-0-58421";"I'll find Zumog Phoom and stop him from reassembling Cadwell the Betrayer."
"204987124-0-58422";"How can I find the mural pieces?"
"204987124-0-58423";"And what do I do with the mural pieces once I found them?"
"204987124-0-58424";"And how can I find the mural pieces?"
"204987124-0-58425";"Why would he take an interest in me?"
"204987124-0-58426";"How can I find the mural pieces?"
"204987124-0-58427";"Take this. I hope it helps."
"204987124-0-58431";"All right. Get all the medicine you need."
"204987124-0-58432";"How's recruitment going?"
"204987124-0-58437";"So you had me steal them for you."
"204987124-0-58439";"You should learn to trust yourself again."
"204987124-0-58441";"I haven't seen Haduras. Where is he?"
"204987124-0-58442";"I haven't seen Haduras. Where is he?"
"204987124-0-58443";"How have things been since I banished the Skooma Cat?"
"204987124-0-58444";"But now you have reason to think otherwise?"
"204987124-0-58445";"Can you tell me more about the town of Hakoshae?"
"204987124-0-58446";"Are you upset that I was the one to kill Phoom?"
"204987124-0-58447";"A lot more blood will be spilled before this is done."
"204987124-0-58449";"Fight well."
"204987124-0-58450";"What did Zamarak do?"
"204987124-0-58451";"You drank Euraxian blood?"
"204987124-0-58452";"I thought you were going to live by your Clan Mother's peaceful ways?"
"204987124-0-58454";"Cadwell, stay with me."
"204987124-0-58455";"He talked about Anequina and the Dragons' imprisonment. He said you possessed the key."
"204987124-0-58456";"So you became vampires?"
"204987124-0-58457";"Will he fight us over this disagreement?"
"204987124-0-58460";"Will you be sticking around?"
"204987124-0-58461";"What happened to you during the battle at the Moon Gate?"
"204987124-0-58463";"Any idea what that could mean?"
"204987124-0-58464";"So, you're some sort of priest?"
"204987124-0-58465";"Can you open portals like Cadwell now, too?"
"204987124-0-58466";"Sounds like things are looking up."
"204987124-0-58467";"You like how she's running things?"
"204987124-0-58469";"Does that mean you're cleaning up your act?"
"204987124-0-58470";"You don't sound so good. Have you considered going back to S'rendarr's Cradle?"
"204987124-0-58473";"Sounds like a good start."
"204987124-0-58474";"I thought you don't like to play in town."
"204987124-0-58476";"What did you do with Khasda?"
"204987124-0-58477";"Anyone else giving you trouble?"
"204987124-0-58479";"Sounds like you've got things well in hand."
"204987124-0-58480";"We worked that job on Meirvale Keep. With Tasnasi."
"204987124-0-58481";"Yes. I've got your cut."
"204987124-0-58483";"Good luck, Sereyne."
"204987124-0-58484";"Good luck, Sereyne."
"204987124-0-58485";"Why not leave before that happens?"
"204987124-0-58487";"What are you looking for, specifically?"
"204987124-0-58489";"Fair enough. I'll gather Marzula-jo's notes and memory stones."
"204987124-0-58490";"Khamira charged the horn at the Shadow Dance Temple."
"204987124-0-58491";"What spirit?"
"204987124-0-58493";"I'll retrieve the Akaviri relics from the tomb."
"204987124-0-58494";"Where are you supposed to place the anchor, when it's done?"
"204987124-0-58496";"Did Versidue-Shaie plot the assassination?"
"204987124-0-58497";"And you said the Akaviri who founded Hakoshae were refugees?"
"204987124-0-58498";"So the people of Hakoshae are all Akaviri?"
"204987124-0-58499";"What exactly is the Akaviri Potentate?"
"204987124-0-58500";"Did you have any valuables stolen?"
"204987124-0-58501";"What did Khunzar-ri offer Kaalgrontiid?"
"204987124-0-58502";"Where is Riverhold?"
"204987124-0-58503";"Why did she have your husband's remains?"
"204987124-0-58504";"Where is Riverhold?"
"204987124-0-58505";"Better luck the rest of the way."
"204987124-0-58510";"Of course, Khamira."
"204987124-0-58514";"Is this the first time a Dragon has aided Euraxia's forces?"
"204987124-0-58519";"Where should I meet Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-0-58520";"That was Euraxia's final order. She issued it right before I killed her."
"204987124-0-58521";"I'm a necromancer. What you're proposing is absolutely necromancy."
"204987124-0-58522";"You mentioned Caldathir again. Who is he, exactly?"
"204987124-0-58533";"Do we know what the Dragons want with the Moon Gate?"
"204987124-0-58545";"What are they looking for?"
"204987124-0-58548";"I can track down the source of the necromantic power."
"204987124-0-58553";"Why are you wearing a pot on your head?"
"204987124-0-58554";"Why do you think you dreamed about this gravestone?"
"204987124-0-58593";"Carindon and Selene don't get along?"
"204987124-0-58596";"What do you know about the blight?"
"204987124-0-58597";"What if Selene doesn't cooperate?"
"204987124-0-58598";"Tell me about Selene."
"204987124-0-58600";"Allanwen thought otherwise."
"204987124-0-58601";"So, you have a better idea then?"
"204987124-0-58602";"What skills do you bring to this situation?"
"204987124-0-58603";"Why is Z'en significant?"
"204987124-0-58604";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-58605";"You're suggesting Carindon broke an agreement with you?"
"204987124-0-58607";"Wouldn't releasing her be easier for everyone?"
"204987124-0-58651";"Where is Khenarthi's Breath Temple?"
"204987124-0-58653";"What happened to the temple bell?"
"204987124-0-58654";"What sort of promises?"
"204987124-0-58655";"And you found him?"
"204987124-0-58656";"Remind me about Khunzar-ri."
"204987124-0-58658";"And what does that tell us?"
"204987124-0-58659";"So Bahzahar is also angry with you?"
"204987124-0-58660";"All right. Let's go to Moonlit Cove and get that bell."
"204987124-0-58666";"Who is your former student and where are they now?"
"204987124-0-58667";"How did you become an expert on the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-58668";"Where are the Dragonguard now?"
"204987124-0-58672";"I'll help you with this cleansing ritual."
"204987124-0-58674";"Or you could apologize to your mother and ask her to help us."
"204987124-0-58677";"Fine. We'll try to perform the cleansing ritual ourselves."
"204987124-0-58678";"You can't determine Yahgrondu's exact location, just provide an idea where to look. Got it."
"204987124-0-58681";"And what do the glyphs do exactly?"
"204987124-0-58682";"And why do you need my help with this?"
"204987124-0-58684";"Tell me more about this Dragonguard seal."
"204987124-0-58685";"You're a member of the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-58686";"But wasn't the abbey destroyed by Mannimarco?"
"204987124-0-58687";"You're being rather secretive about this former student."
"204987124-0-58688";"You're being rather secretive about this former student."
"204987124-0-58690";"Very well. Let's ride to the Abbey of Blades."
"204987124-0-58695";"Was this all part of the plan then?"
"204987124-0-58697";"Let's ride to Wind Scour Temple in Alik'r."
"204987124-0-58704";"What are we looking for on this island?"
"204987124-0-58706";"All right. Let's find the aegis and destroy it."
"204987124-0-58707";"Can Kaalgrontiid actually become a god?"
"204987124-0-58708";"Is that why Grundwulf wants to drink the Dragon's blood?"
"204987124-0-58709";"What do they hope to accomplish by drinking the Dragon's blood?"
"204987124-0-58710";"What do the Hollowfangs need him for?"
"204987124-0-58711";"The rise of the new moon is dangerous?"
"204987124-0-58712";"The Dark Aeon?"
"204987124-0-58713";"What else do you see?"
"204987124-0-58715";"You've been here ever since?"
"204987124-0-58716";"We stopped Mulaamnir. We'll stop Kaalgrontiid, too."
"204987124-0-58717";"Perhaps these maps will help. They show the locations of two Dragonguard sanctuaries."
"204987124-0-58718";"Perhaps these maps will help you. They show the locations of two Dragonguard sanctuaries."
"204987124-0-58719";"Perhaps these maps will help. They show the location of two Dragonguard sanctuaries."
"204987124-0-58720";"What do you want me to do in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-58721";"And the Hollowfangs?"
"204987124-0-58722";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-58724";"I'm not going to kill representatives of King Camoran on your word alone, Carindon."
"204987124-0-58725";"What will you do with your freedom?"
"204987124-0-58727";"You killed and enslaved Selene and risked all our lives."
"204987124-0-58728";"So he owes you a debt for saving his life?"
"204987124-0-58729";"Tell me more about Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-58730";"Let's keep looking."
"204987124-0-58731";"What do you see in the tapestry?"
"204987124-0-58732";"And that silhouette. That's Kaalgrontiid?"
"204987124-0-58734";"Then let's find it and destroy it."
"204987124-0-58737";"It sounds like you have a plan."
"204987124-0-58740";"The Wall of Life?"
"204987124-0-58741";"How will they guide us?"
"204987124-0-58742";"All right, I'll see if I can return your bell."
"204987124-0-58743";"It seems the bell might be irreplaceable."
"204987124-0-58744";"What does the skooma lord want with the sacred water?"
"204987124-0-58745";"Armed escort? Where are they?"
"204987124-0-58746";"Remind me. How do you know Abnur Tharn?"
"204987124-0-58747";"The sanctuary's in Eastmarch, south of Windhelm."
"204987124-0-58751";"Let's head for Dark Water Temple right now. (Fast Travel to Eastmarch)"
"204987124-0-58755";"The Dragon makes its lair in a dormant volcano in Southern Elsweyr. The journal includes a map."
"204987124-0-58756";"Let's depart then. (Fast Travel to Abbey of Blades)"
"204987124-0-58758";"This seems like the sort of relic you were searching for."
"204987124-0-58762";"This one has unique powers, but it was stolen by a Dragon."
"204987124-0-58765";"A journal contained a map to its lair. It lies in Southern Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-58767";"Thank you, Kasura."
"204987124-0-58777";"I saw your father during the Cantor's trance."
"204987124-0-58778";"Could we use a Moon Gate to reach Dragonhold?"
"204987124-0-58779";"I hope you're right."
"204987124-0-58783";"Can we force the door?"
"204987124-0-58785";"How can we do that?"
"204987124-0-58788";"The Potentate's been gone for a while now."
"204987124-0-58789";"What is this place? The sentinels seem like part of the ruins."
"204987124-0-58790";"And this is your tomb?"
"204987124-0-58791";"A secret path?"
"204987124-0-58792";"Have you returned to help us defeat Kaalgrontiid?"
"204987124-0-58794";"You want me to give Khamira one of your claws?"
"204987124-0-58796";"My heart will burst apart?"
"204987124-0-58801";"How do we disrupt the flow of energy?"
"204987124-0-58802";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-58803";"I'll destroy the aeonstones."
"204987124-0-58806";"Namiira took advantage of his grief and hopelessness. He believes he's saving Vijari."
"204987124-0-58808";"Namiira had him mixing something at the Colorwork up the hill."
"204987124-0-58810";"The blood of a flightless bird."
"204987124-0-58817";"Passage of Dad'na Ghaten?"
"204987124-0-58819";"What do we do when we find him?"
"204987124-0-58823";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-58825";"Tharn, what happens if Kaalgrontiid makes a mistake?"
"204987124-0-58827";"Tharn, are you all right?"
"204987124-0-58830";"We're in this together, Tharn."
"204987124-0-58833";"I can't just leave you here to die, Tharn."
"204987124-0-58843";"You did it, Vijari. You restored the Wall of Life."
"204987124-0-58846";"Does the origin of the Dragonhorn matter?"
"204987124-0-58848";"What's your next move, Sai?"
"204987124-0-58849";"Sai should be along shortly."
"204987124-0-58851";"What about Sai Sahan and Nahfahlaar?"
"204987124-0-58852";"I only did what needed to be done, Khamira."
"204987124-0-58856";"Yes. They serve the Dragon Laatvulon. I've faced them several times."
"204987124-0-58859";"Tell me what you know and I'll take care of the cult."
"204987124-0-58861";"All right, I'll speak to Buzinda."
"204987124-0-58863";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-58864";"Bribe the clerk, pay the forger, and steal the manifest. Got it."
"204987124-0-58865";"Could some jewels convince you to add me to the schedule?"
"204987124-0-58867";"I understand. Here are your jewels."
"204987124-0-58870";"Will these jewels cover the expense?"
"204987124-0-58872";"Don't worry, I have a plan."
"204987124-0-58875";"What do you know about the Dragon or this island?"
"204987124-0-58876";"So we might have allies to help us take down the Dragon?"
"204987124-0-58878";"All right. Let's go speak with General Renmus."
"204987124-0-58888";"Yes, that's exactly what happened. How did you know?"
"204987124-0-58889";"So, you plan to rob Turo a second time?"
"204987124-0-58890";"Yes, I'm still in. I'll meet you at this warehouse."
"204987124-0-58892";"What was that?"
"204987124-0-58894";"Did Khamira say anything else?"
"204987124-0-58896";"I'll go to Senchal and find Khamira."
"204987124-0-58934";"So you enjoy being a member of the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-58938";"I'm glad to see you haven't completely changed, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-58939";"So you plan to stay with the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-58941";"I think you're right, Caska."
"204987124-0-58943";"You earned your place in the Dragonguard, Aeliah."
"204987124-0-58945";"Good luck with everything, Aeliah."
"204987124-0-58947";"Why do you think the Order of the New Moon took her?"
"204987124-0-58948";"I'll head to the tavern and see what Kazahn knows."
"204987124-0-58949";"Do you have any idea where she might have gone? Anyone she might have spoken to?"
"204987124-0-58950";"And Abnur Tharn? Did he escape the destruction of the island, too?"
"204987124-0-58951";"Are you glad Kaalgrontiid is dead?"
"204987124-0-58952";"What was Kaalgrontiid really trying to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-58954";"You weren't in a relationship with her?"
"204987124-0-58955";"We're trying to find Lahini to help her. If she meant anything to you, you'll help us."
"204987124-0-58957";"Do you know where they went?"
"204987124-0-58959";"All right, let's check with Ranza and see what he remembers."
"204987124-0-58960";"I appreciate it."
"204987124-0-58961";"And you want me to bring this offer to the general?"
"204987124-0-58966";"Queen Khamira just wants to help."
"204987124-0-58967";"Good luck, General Renmus."
"204987124-0-58968";"Good luck, General Renmus."
"204987124-0-58970";"Do you know where they went?"
"204987124-0-58972";"All right, I'll check with Ranza and see what he can tell me."
"204987124-0-58973";"You have to let us try. This Dragon could attack Senchal at any moment."
"204987124-0-58976";"I understand. We'll look for a ship elsewhere."
"204987124-0-58977";"After you, then."
"204987124-0-58978";"I understand."
"204987124-0-58981";"So the general's daughter is friends with a smuggler."
"204987124-0-58982";"Where can I find Za'ji?"
"204987124-0-58984";"Thank you. I'll see if Za'ji is willing to help."
"204987124-0-58985";"What makes you so sure they'll let you into the Black Kiergo?"
"204987124-0-58987";"All right, I'll meet you in the Outlaws Refuge."
"204987124-0-58988";"So now it's an underground fighting arena?"
"204987124-0-58989";"Do you know where your ship may be?"
"204987124-0-58990";"Aeliah said you could sail us to a nearby island so we can slay a Dragon."
"204987124-0-58992";"What's our first step?"
"204987124-0-58993";"And you believe he's in South Guard Ruins?"
"204987124-0-58994";"Can you tell me more about yourself and your crew?"
"204987124-0-58995";"Tell me about South Guard Ruins."
"204987124-0-58997";"Why didn't you trust Nartise?"
"204987124-0-58999";"My companion and I will join the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-0-59000";"You said this wasn't personal."
"204987124-0-59002";"And?"
"204987124-0-59005";"So what did Ra'khajin do?"
"204987124-0-59006";"So you want the Dragons to rule once more?"
"204987124-0-59007";"Where are the others? Did you see where your abductors took them?"
"204987124-0-59009";"All right, I'll look for the others in the caves near the slaving vessel."
"204987124-0-59010";"We'll head into the fortress then."
"204987124-0-59011";"Where is the chancel?"
"204987124-0-59016";"Agreed. Let's head to the tavern and speak with Kazahn."
"204987124-0-59021";"Where will you and Safik go?"
"204987124-0-59025";"And you hope to find this wisdom in a tomb?"
"204987124-0-59027";"I'll take the seal and help you. How do I find these glyphs?"
"204987124-0-59029";"I have some questions about what you need me to do."
"204987124-0-59030";"Is your feeling related to the letter Sai Sahan received?"
"204987124-0-59033";"New arrivals?"
"204987124-0-59035";"Do you really think restoring the tapestry will help Senchal?"
"204987124-0-59037";"Any ideas where we should search?"
"204987124-0-59041";"Shouldn't you be in Rimmen?"
"204987124-0-59042";"Nahfahlaar helped us reform the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59044";"Nahfahlaar hasn't eaten any of us yet."
"204987124-0-59045";"Remind me about our adventures in Anequina."
"204987124-0-59046";"Are you two going to be able to work together?"
"204987124-0-59047";"So you sold the ship to a slaver?"
"204987124-0-59048";"It's going to be pretty obvious if you're lying."
"204987124-0-59050";"We'll see about that."
"204987124-0-59052";"Where have you been since we worked together in Northern Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-59053";"Supposedly? You don't believe the legends?"
"204987124-0-59054";"You and Sai Sahan don't seem to get along."
"204987124-0-59055";"He could be telling the truth. Perhaps he didn't know Irathi was a slave trader."
"204987124-0-59056";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-59058";"All right, I'll go with Caska to secure your ship."
"204987124-0-59059";"All right, I'll head to the ship then."
"204987124-0-59061";"You should tell Do'mazir your decision."
"204987124-0-59065";"Caska and I entered over there."
"204987124-0-59067";"What about Tharn? He doesn't look too well."
"204987124-0-59078";"But he's not Dragonborn?"
"204987124-0-59079";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-59080";"He was tracking down the other thieves himself, but his notes are in riddles."
"204987124-0-59081";"What will you do with the first piece?"
"204987124-0-59083";"I'll place this piece in the frame then."
"204987124-0-59084";"How can you help us?"
"204987124-0-59085";"All right, welcome aboard. We depart soon."
"204987124-0-59089";"The Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59090";"It's true. We're trying to stop him. Do you know why Pridehome was attacked?"
"204987124-0-59093";"What was he doing with his voice? It resembled the Dragon's."
"204987124-0-59094";"How is that possible?"
"204987124-0-59095";"Who are the Greybeards?"
"204987124-0-59096";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-59097";"What made him different?"
"204987124-0-59098";"How many of you are there?"
"204987124-0-59099";"I'd like to know more about Grundwulf."
"204987124-0-59100";"You mean you'll take a new identity, or were you speaking literally?"
"204987124-0-59101";"I'm told she fled through here to the inner temple. The cult wasn't far behind."
"204987124-0-59107";"And your fellow Wood Elf? How does he fit in here?"
"204987124-0-59108";"Where do you want me to go?"
"204987124-0-59111";"Search the cavern northeast of here. Got it."
"204987124-0-59112";"Do you have any ideas why?"
"204987124-0-59114";"Got it. I'll follow you."
"204987124-0-59120";"Are you suggesting we make an alliance with Nahfahlaar?"
"204987124-0-59124";"Ra'khajin was supposed to join the Pride of Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-59125";"Who's the Demon from the East?"
"204987124-0-59127";"What about you? Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-59130";"And Ra'kahjin wants this divine mask, though we're not sure why."
"204987124-0-59131";"But we have no idea where the mask is."
"204987124-0-59132";"We should stop the ceremony. It's giving Laatvulon more power."
"204987124-0-59133";"That will definitely attract their attention."
"204987124-0-59135";"All right, I'm ready to destroy the aeonstone."
"204987124-0-59140";"You seem determined."
"204987124-0-59141";"And you blame yourself for all those things?"
"204987124-0-59142";"Za'ji said you could help us rebuild the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59143";"Sounds logical. I'll leave you to it."
"204987124-0-59146";"If he has her bound, can't Carindon just force her cooperation?"
"204987124-0-59147";"I will face his darkness."
"204987124-0-59149";"What ceremony?"
"204987124-0-59150";"I will walk the path."
"204987124-0-59161";"Seems like you're putting a lot of faith in old legends."
"204987124-0-59162";"I'd like to know more about you all."
"204987124-0-59163";"So your new purpose is to stop the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59164";"Does Lyris know you're alive?"
"204987124-0-59165";"So, if we find Lady G, we find your friends?"
"204987124-0-59168";"What have you been up to since Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-59170";"Why do you want to find a way to battle the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59173";"I found her, but I couldn't convince her to leave. She joined the ceremony."
"204987124-0-59175";"Do you want some time to think about it?"
"204987124-0-59177";"That was a quick decision."
"204987124-0-59179";"If you want to join us, you're welcome. But it won't be easy."
"204987124-0-59180";"It's called aeonstone. The cultists give their life energy to it to empower Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-59181";"If I help you you'll get me into the event?"
"204987124-0-59183";"Then its settled. You're one of the Dragonguard now."
"204987124-0-59185";"Why do you want to find a way to battle the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59186";"There's more. They're mounting an attack on a place called Pridehome."
"204987124-0-59199";"All right, let's head to the New Moon Fortress."
"204987124-0-59202";"Sure, we'll deliver the token. Where does Auberic live?"
"204987124-0-59204";"Why do you believe the Dragon is the source of the blight?"
"204987124-0-59205";"Wouldn't a storefront be easier?"
"204987124-0-59207";"I know about your hunt in the swamp. I want in, and I'm willing to give you this Orc as payment."
"204987124-0-59215";"See you there, Lady Ghisiliane."
"204987124-0-59228";"He's still on the island. He used the last of his strength to send me to get help."
"204987124-0-59230";"I'll meet you at the Dragonguard Sanctum."
"204987124-0-59233";"How did you know where to find me?"
"204987124-0-59234";"Is the Dragonguard ready to face Kaalgrontiid?"
"204987124-0-59238";"Are you sure you want to go with me? Maybe you should let Sai Sahan know what we found."
"204987124-0-59240";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-59241";"All right, if you're sure …."
"204987124-0-59243";"All right, I'll ask Kasura about this grappling bow."
"204987124-0-59245";"All right, I'll light the brazier and then speak to Sai."
"204987124-0-59247";"What are we looking for in the Wind Scour Temple?"
"204987124-0-59248";"Why do you want to find a way to battle the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59250";"I'm sorry. So, that's why you hate Turo."
"204987124-0-59253";"What do you think is about to happen?"
"204987124-0-59254";"Important business? And what friend?"
"204987124-0-59256";"I'll talk to Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-59257";"I think you two will get along fine."
"204987124-0-59260";"You need to think of something only you can do."
"204987124-0-59266";"Is she in greater danger in the ruins? What's in there?"
"204987124-0-59268";"I'm sorry, Tajahir. Rest easy."
"204987124-0-59270";"My patron was concerned over, uhm, unknowns digging in to her business."
"204987124-0-59271";"Perhaps you'd better tell me what else you may have discussed with your friends"
"204987124-0-59273";"Just tell us where we can find Lady Ghisiliane"
"204987124-0-59275";"My patron was concerned over, uhm, unknowns digging in to her business."
"204987124-0-59276";"Skordo?"
"204987124-0-59277";"Thank you for your time."
"204987124-0-59279";"Is there any way you'll let me in?"
"204987124-0-59287";"I'll watch over you, Khamira."
"204987124-0-59289";"What was the ""war for freedom"" he mentioned?"
"204987124-0-59290";"Waits for me? Aren't you coming with us to Moonlit Cove?"
"204987124-0-59293";"Yes, I saw the ghost cat quite clearly."
"204987124-0-59294";"All right, I'll check with Ranza and see what he can tell me."
"204987124-0-59297";"What's the significance of the Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59301";"Marekki seems no worse for the wear."
"204987124-0-59302";"How do you think Vahlokzin managed to steal the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-59303";"The horn is a weapon?"
"204987124-0-59304";"What do we know about Vahlokzin's lair?"
"204987124-0-59307";"What will you do now, Skordo?"
"204987124-0-59308";"I'm sorry for your loss. What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-59310";"Good luck. You two make an interesting pair."
"204987124-0-59311";"What's the significance of the Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59313";"It's true. I defeated the Dragon Maarselok near Grahtwood."
"204987124-0-59314";"But I had allies to aid me in that fight. Can we face a Dragon with just two of us?"
"204987124-0-59315";"But I had allies to aid me in that fight. Can we face a Dragon with just two of us?"
"204987124-0-59316";"But I had allies to aid me in that fight. Can we face a Dragon with just two of us?"
"204987124-0-59317";"Before we depart, can we review what we learned at the Dragonguard sanctuaries?"
"204987124-0-59318";"What can you tell me about the Dragon plaguing your home?"
"204987124-0-59319";"Why come all the way here for help?"
"204987124-0-59320";"I'll look for the missing tablet pieces."
"204987124-0-59322";"And how have things been in Elden Root since we defeated Maarselok?"
"204987124-0-59323";"What happened with Carindon after we parted ways?"
"204987124-0-59324";"Can I help?"
"204987124-0-59327";"What do you mean by ""a true successor""?"
"204987124-0-59328";"All right. Head north along the beach. The way should be clear."
"204987124-0-59330";"Just save yourself for now. Head back to the beach. I cleared the way."
"204987124-0-59332";"Yes, I defeated a Dragon in Northern Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-59333";"I don't think we should take this Dragon's threat that lightly."
"204987124-0-59334";"Before we depart, can we review what we learned at the Dragonguard sanctuaries?"
"204987124-0-59335";"Pahmar-raht?"
"204987124-0-59337";"Snow lilies?"
"204987124-0-59340";"So Sai has never told anyone why this shrine means so much to him?"
"204987124-0-59341";"But Lryis isn't here anymore, is she?"
"204987124-0-59343";"How did Sai take her departure?"
"204987124-0-59344";"No. She sacrificed herself, so that we could defeat Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-59347";"Sai made this shrine for Lyris, didn't he? That seems like a way to remember her."
"204987124-0-59348";"Do you know why she left her ax?"
"204987124-0-59350";"Do you have any idea where Lyris went?"
"204987124-0-59351";"Khunzar-ri's spirit appeared and told me to take his claw and give it to you."
"204987124-0-59352";"Who is this Turo, exactly? I found his name on the cargo manifest."
"204987124-0-59356";"I'll head to Storm Talon Temple and meet you there. (Fast Travel to Stormhaven)"
"204987124-0-59357";"They didn't find the Dragonhorn here, but they were going to search Storm Talon Temple next."
"204987124-0-59358";"There must be some connection between them."
"204987124-0-59359";"I'll check on your brother, but I need some answers."
"204987124-0-59361";"How so?"
"204987124-0-59362";"What's your relationship to Grundwulf?"
"204987124-0-59363";"I'd like to know more about Grundwulf."
"204987124-0-59364";"And you believe the Dragon on this island will be the one to attack."
"204987124-0-59365";"Any idea where they're headed?"
"204987124-0-59366";"I'll help you fight the Dragons, but you still haven't told me anything but your name."
"204987124-0-59367";"And do you think General Renmus will help us?"
"204987124-0-59369";"Why do you want to hunt Dragons, though?"
"204987124-0-59370";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59371";"The Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59372";"There are many ways to help Tamriel. Why become a Dragon hunter?"
"204987124-0-59373";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59374";"The Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59375";"You don't have any idea how you survived?"
"204987124-0-59376";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59377";"The Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59378";"What have you learned?"
"204987124-0-59379";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59380";"What does that mean for battle?"
"204987124-0-59383";"Do we have the support of the Shields of Senchal?"
"204987124-0-59385";"Then we're on our own."
"204987124-0-59386";"All right. I'll gather the rest of the Dragonguard while you open the portal."
"204987124-0-59387";"All right. Open the portal."
"204987124-0-59391";"And what about our forger, <<1>> ?"
"204987124-0-59392";"Tell me more about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59393";"Why did smugglers take over Moonlit Cove?"
"204987124-0-59394";"The cove is full of trapped moonlight?"
"204987124-0-59395";"What did the Dragonguard use the grappling bow for?"
"204987124-0-59396";"Can we use the grappling bow against Elsweyr's Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59399";"Could it be Laatvulon's lair?"
"204987124-0-59401";"Any reports about the Order of the New Moon?"
"204987124-0-59403";"I'm ready to fight."
"204987124-0-59404";"What can you tell me about your cat, Winks?"
"204987124-0-59406";"You said your guard chased after the thieves?"
"204987124-0-59407";"So how did a Khajiit from Elsweyr wind up raised by Orcs in Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-59408";"What makes your uncle's moon-sugar gourmet?"
"204987124-0-59421";"Ja'darri asked you to empower the mask? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-59423";"Why is Laatvulon so dangerous? Isn't he just another Dragon?"
"204987124-0-59424";"He's willing. We're ready to empower the mask."
"204987124-0-59425";"I want to defeat Laatvulon. Will you tell me how?"
"204987124-0-59427";"I'll go speak with Nahfahlaar, then."
"204987124-0-59428";"What did you find?"
"204987124-0-59430";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-59431";"<Enter Icereach.>"
"204987124-0-59432";"Do you know what these attackers want?"
"204987124-0-59434";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-59435";"<Enter Unhallowed Grave.>"
"204987124-0-59437";"All right. I'll destroy the coven and try to find your compatriots."
"204987124-0-59443";"All right, I'll help you rid this burial site of graverobbers."
"204987124-0-59449";"Sai said the ancient Dragonguard made use of this device."
"204987124-0-59452";"All right, I'll gather the grappling bow and give it a try."
"204987124-0-59453";"Do you know anything about these statues?"
"204987124-0-59454";"All right, I'll read the plaques and try lighting the braziers."
"204987124-0-59455";"And how do these Grandmasters help us reach that ledge?"
"204987124-0-59456";"What do you expect to find inside these tombs?"
"204987124-0-59457";"All right, I'll try to grapple to the archives."
"204987124-0-59461";"Allanwen already agreed to free you."
"204987124-0-59462";"How did a blademaster decide to search a Dragonguard tomb?"
"204987124-0-59464";"It's strange that Kasura is interested in a Dragonguard tomb."
"204987124-0-59466";"So, you control her because she can control others?"
"204987124-0-59468";"Maybe Yahgrondu has joined with Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-59469";"We'll meet you at the limestone quarry."
"204987124-0-59473";"I'm not sure, but we need to find Yahgrondu. He should be in a nearby mine."
"204987124-0-59475";"I'm ready to depart for Wind Scour Temple."
"204987124-0-59481";"Did you know any of them personally?"
"204987124-0-59482";"A necromancer named Ra'khajin used the green stone here to raise Yahgrondu."
"204987124-0-59483";"Without Yahgrondu, what do we do?"
"204987124-0-59486";"If your plan is such a gamble, why not try something less risky?"
"204987124-0-59491";"I'll meet you at Black Heights."
"204987124-0-59492";"So what's our next step?"
"204987124-0-59493";"I'll help you deal with this Dragon threat."
"204987124-0-59495";"Who is Antonia, exactly?"
"204987124-0-59498";"She's busy covering her tracks. She should be here any moment."
"204987124-0-59499";"You have a key to Bahzahar's hideout?"
"204987124-0-59500";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-59504";"But you left the abbey to search for the Dragonguard tombs."
"204987124-0-59507";"What is this mask? And who's Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59508";"Fine. I'll speak with Clan Mother Tadali."
"204987124-0-59509";"It does matter. Your horn is named after Ja'darri! There must be more of a connection."
"204987124-0-59514";"Then what did you do?"
"204987124-0-59517";"Khunzar-ri's spirit led us through the Jonelight Path."
"204987124-0-59519";"What happened to it?"
"204987124-0-59521";"If your mother was a diplomat, why would she draw you to a military academy?"
"204987124-0-59522";"Did she ever say anything about the necklace? About its significance?"
"204987124-0-59523";"Catina Garrana sent me. Her mother, Honoria, gave her this necklace. Do you recognize it?"
"204987124-0-59524";"""Khenarthi flies overhead. Alkosh stands in glory. The Mane bows before their greatness."""
"204987124-0-59526";"What do they have to do with the pulleys?"
"204987124-0-59527";"If we have only one grappling bow, how will you get across the chasm?"
"204987124-0-59528";"You mentioned a curse. Could this locket break it somehow?"
"204987124-0-59530";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-59533";"Anything in the Dragonguard records you've been studying?"
"204987124-0-59535";"I'll talk to Khamira."
"204987124-0-59536";"Just the two of us? Will that be enough to turn the tide of the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59537";"So your days of hunting Dragonguard secrets are over?"
"204987124-0-59538";"What about Lyris? Wasn't she going to help you rebuild the abbey?"
"204987124-0-59539";"What caused her to depart?"
"204987124-0-59540";"I see. What will you do after you've trained with the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-59541";"I see. What will you do after you've trained with the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-59553";"Have you spoken with the other Companions lately?"
"204987124-0-59555";"I'd still like your opinion."
"204987124-0-59559";"Well, it looks like a big horn. The one I used sounded and knocked Dragons out of the sky."
"204987124-0-59560";"They didn't find the Dragonhorn here, but they were going to search Storm Talon Temple next."
"204987124-0-59561";"Khenarthi is the key? Hold on!"
"204987124-0-59566";"Are you worried about another attack on the abbey?"
"204987124-0-59567";"It certainly seems your days of hunting Dragonguard secrets are over, then."
"204987124-0-59568";"I see. What will you do after you've trained with the Dragonhorn?"
"204987124-0-59569";"Do you think she is lying?"
"204987124-0-59572";"Maybe some sort of zoo?"
"204987124-0-59573";"She hired a Khajiit to deliver a token, but she thinks he decided to get drunk instead."
"204987124-0-59575";"Were you able to determine the location of the Dragon's lair?"
"204987124-0-59578";"I'll accompany you to the Dragon's lair, Sai."
"204987124-0-59597";"Who are the Shields of Senchal?"
"204987124-0-59598";"And what is it you do here, exactly?"
"204987124-0-59599";"Why don't your clients come straight to us?"
"204987124-0-59601";"If you say so, I guess."
"204987124-0-59602";"How's that?"
"204987124-0-59603";"But these tomes are sealed?"
"204987124-0-59604";"Sounds good to me. I'm interested in these jobs."
"204987124-0-59605";"All right, I'm interested in the job."
"204987124-0-59606";"All right, I'm interested in the job."
"204987124-0-59609";"Tell me about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-59610";"Who is Grandmaster Vashu-Pir?"
"204987124-0-59611";"It sounds like you're not very pleased with our Dragon ally."
"204987124-0-59612";"A man named Jano Invel needed your mother's help casting a spell. She left and the spell failed."
"204987124-0-59615";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-59616";"What do we know about Laatvulon's cult?"
"204987124-0-59617";"If we defeat Laatvulon, he'll never get the chance to attack Senchal."
"204987124-0-59618";"Why did Za'ji stop you?"
"204987124-0-59621";"I thought you weren't good at small talk."
"204987124-0-59622";"So … I guess you'll be needing these clothes."
"204987124-0-59629";"You think Allanwen is in league with Selene?"
"204987124-0-59634";"But you prefer the form of a spider?"
"204987124-0-59636";"Shagrath?"
"204987124-0-59638";"We're on a mission to investigate the Order of the New Moon. Think you can help?"
"204987124-0-59640";"What about Caska? Is she able to help?"
"204987124-0-59641";"I'll go and talk to General Renmus."
"204987124-0-59645";"And what about <<1>>? Why do I need to steal his ship's manifest?"
"204987124-0-59648";"Why have you decided to hunt Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59649";"What's going to happen to Carindon?"
"204987124-0-59652";"Is serving as the Queen's Claw everything you hoped for?"
"204987124-0-59654";"See any action on your way here?"
"204987124-0-59655";"And your fellow Wood Elf? How does he fit in here?"
"204987124-0-59656";"And your fellow Wood Elf? How does he fit in here?"
"204987124-0-59659";"Thanks for your help, by the way."
"204987124-0-59663";"Things do change. I'll prove it."
"204987124-0-59664";"We defeated Selene. Is she really a match for Maarselok?"
"204987124-0-59665";"We defeated Selene. Is she really a match for Maarselok?"
"204987124-0-59666";"This won't be like last time. You won't use either of us again."
"204987124-0-59668";"You have her soul trapped and bound to you?"
"204987124-0-59670";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59672";"Where is Nahfahlaar?"
"204987124-0-59675";"How will you help?"
"204987124-0-59676";"So you control her?"
"204987124-0-59677";"So you were sent to take over the city?"
"204987124-0-59678";"Have you been able to fight back against the Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59679";"So the Khajiit accept you?"
"204987124-0-59681";"Tell me about the situation in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59685";"Oathbreaker?"
"204987124-0-59686";"Oathbreaker?"
"204987124-0-59687";"I want to know more about you and your position."
"204987124-0-59688";"Allanwen believes we need Carindon to succeed."
"204987124-0-59689";"You mean his experiments?"
"204987124-0-59690";"I didn't know that. I'm sorry. You'll have your freedom after we deal with Maarselok."
"204987124-0-59694";"You were holding back?"
"204987124-0-59696";"You were holding back?"
"204987124-0-59697";"What did you mean when you said ""despite Carindon's meddling"" before?"
"204987124-0-59698";"You won't go after Carindon?"
"204987124-0-59699";"What did you mean when you said ""despite Carindon's meddling"" before?"
"204987124-0-59700";"Do you know why Maarselok was so interested in you?"
"204987124-0-59702";"And Selene?"
"204987124-0-59706";"How does the Thirteenth Legion pay for Sai's failure?"
"204987124-0-59707";"I want to know more about you and your position."
"204987124-0-59708";"Is that captain … you?"
"204987124-0-59709";"Well, you have agreed to sail us to a Dragon's island lair."
"204987124-0-59710";"Speaking of your ship, why do you think Nartise was the one who stole it?"
"204987124-0-59712";"Do you think Nartise is in South Guard Ruins?"
"204987124-0-59713";"And how do I open the way forward?"
"204987124-0-59715";"I'll make my way to the chamber below and start the trial."
"204987124-0-59717";"Let's head to the north entrance, then."
"204987124-0-59719";"How do you know where to find these Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59720";"I'm sorry to hear that."
"204987124-0-59723";"I'd like to speak with the crew before we set sail."
"204987124-0-59724";"What's the Horn of Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-59725";"More resistance? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59726";"Dak'radhi is the one who created that corrupted mural at the Wall of Life."
"204987124-0-59729";"I'll head to the west sentry tower at once."
"204987124-0-59730";"I can go down there and try to find Maezi."
"204987124-0-59732";"The blood of a flightless bird."
"204987124-0-59733";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"204987124-0-59736";"What alliances have you made in the past?"
"204987124-0-59737";"Zhasim asked me to find you. He seemed very worried about you."
"204987124-0-59739";"I'll find the moon-sugar and meet you in Senchal."
"204987124-0-59740";"Tell me more about Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-59741";"The Horn of Ja'darri."
"204987124-0-59742";"What about Lyris? Wasn't she going to help you rebuild the abbey?"
"204987124-0-59743";"What caused her to depart?"
"204987124-0-59744";"Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59745";"Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59746";"Let's change topics, then. Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59747";"Why would the emperor's honor guard also hunt Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59748";"Do you think our companions are Dragonguard material?"
"204987124-0-59749";"And what does being Akaviri have to do with hunting Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59750";"What happened when Reman III was assassinated?"
"204987124-0-59751";"They're smugglers. And we also have a general's daughter."
"204987124-0-59752";"Tell me more about the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59753";"Perhaps you should ask your crew first."
"204987124-0-59755";"Good to have you with us, Caska."
"204987124-0-59756";"So the legionaries succumbed to the flu?"
"204987124-0-59757";"This note may help us with that."
"204987124-0-59758";"Tell me more about these dreams. Are they always the same?"
"204987124-0-59760";"What sort of research are you doing?"
"204987124-0-59762";"That's a good idea. Do you know who you're going to sell it to?"
"204987124-0-59765";"I'll retrieve the last of the gourmet moon-sugar."
"204987124-0-59767";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-59768";"How did you end up in Senchal?"
"204987124-0-59770";"You didn't want to be separated from your father?"
"204987124-0-59771";"So will you stay here in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-59772";"Then why fight them now? Why not run or hide?"
"204987124-0-59774";"So what's next for Zhasim and Winks?"
"204987124-0-59776";"Researching Dragonguard techniques would be helpful. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-59777";"And what about Chizbari?"
"204987124-0-59778";"Do you think your crew is up for the challenge of being part of the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-59781";"And you allied with the Dragonguard to defeat him?"
"204987124-0-59785";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-59786";"How did Laatvulon escape?"
"204987124-0-59787";"Tell me more about Khenarthi's Breath Temple."
"204987124-0-59788";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59789";"Tell me more about Black Heights."
"204987124-0-59791";"Why do you want to leave South Guard?"
"204987124-0-59792";"They're invisible?"
"204987124-0-59793";"Can't you just make some more?"
"204987124-0-59794";"Well, here's your … cat."
"204987124-0-59795";"I noticed the fire damage. What happened here anyway?"
"204987124-0-59796";"So someone burned this place to deal with the flu?"
"204987124-0-59797";"You said these caravaners were criminals. What else do you know about them?"
"204987124-0-59800";"You tried to rob a caravan. Doesn't that make you a criminal too?"
"204987124-0-59802";"And Khenarthi helps you find lost things?"
"204987124-0-59803";"Why did you offer to help us if you're still so angry with Za'ji?"
"204987124-0-59804";"I want to hear more about this incident with Za'ji."
"204987124-0-59805";"Tell me about Khenarthi's Breath Temple."
"204987124-0-59807";"You said you stole the bell to buy your ship?"
"204987124-0-59808";"Tell me more about Moonlit Cove."
"204987124-0-59812";"Glad I could be of service."
"204987124-0-59815";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59816";"Is that what I'm smelling?"
"204987124-0-59817";"You want me to drink the sullied water?"
"204987124-0-59822";"And who is Antonia, exactly?"
"204987124-0-59823";"And now?"
"204987124-0-59824";"Why are you so reluctant to talk about Turo?"
"204987124-0-59825";"What do you mean, for now?"
"204987124-0-59826";"Some aspect of Honoria remains tied to this locket. Will burning it burn her as well?"
"204987124-0-59827";"Can you describe him?"
"204987124-0-59828";"What do you know about this place?"
"204987124-0-59831";"How is Ka'ishka?"
"204987124-0-59832";"What pushed them out of power?"
"204987124-0-59833";"How so?"
"204987124-0-59834";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-59843";"So these blades are completely safe?"
"204987124-0-59845";"So, this is just a test?"
"204987124-0-59846";"How do they react to the moons, exactly?"
"204987124-0-59847";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59848";"Wait, you were a skooma addict?"
"204987124-0-59850";"What have you been up to, Sai?"
"204987124-0-59851";"And you think this green stone is important?"
"204987124-0-59852";"So now they're ready to fight Dragons?"
"204987124-0-59854";"It doesn't sound like you think we have any hope of defeating Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-59855";"Very well. I'd like to review what we've learned so far."
"204987124-0-59858";"You make it sound like a revelation."
"204987124-0-59860";"Why isn't he on good terms with his adeptorium?"
"204987124-0-59861";"Meridian nonsense?"
"204987124-0-59862";"You don't care much for Meridia, do you?"
"204987124-0-59863";"You mentioned Meridia before. Why do you dislike Meridia?"
"204987124-0-59866";"You have a lot of missing citizens?"
"204987124-0-59867";"Sounds like a desperate situation."
"204987124-0-59868";"So how do we get to this island?"
"204987124-0-59870";"How do we get him and the others back?"
"204987124-0-59871";"All right, I'll rescue the others then meet you in Turo's fortress. Good luck."
"204987124-0-59873";"Any idea as to the cause?"
"204987124-0-59875";"You mentioned that Senchal was close to rioting. Did something happen?"
"204987124-0-59876";"Your city envoy?"
"204987124-0-59877";"I agreed to look for the other two portions of the stolen moon-sugar."
"204987124-0-59878";"You're willing to abandon your Orc family for a life in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-59880";"You have feelings for Maezi? Have you told her? Maybe she feels the same about you."
"204987124-0-59881";"Speaking of worry, you seem concerned about Lahini. Why did you refuse to help find her?"
"204987124-0-59882";"Aeliah chose to join the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-59885";"Cabin Man?"
"204987124-0-59886";"How does killing this courier help if they've already cut a deal?"
"204987124-0-59892";"What happened with the terror birds? Did they wreck all those wagons?"
"204987124-0-59894";"All right, I'll help you get out of this."
"204987124-0-59895";"What terrible truth?"
"204987124-0-59896";"What was the Confederacy you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-59897";"Right. We followed them through the Moon-Gate and stopped them."
"204987124-0-59898";"Tharn thinks the cultists have a way to reach an island off the coast. It may be in the fortress."
"204987124-0-59899";"Thanks for the advice. Sorry to interrupt your nap."
"204987124-0-59900";"You think there could be a portal in the amphitheater?"
"204987124-0-59903";"Using that energy seems to have made you weaker."
"204987124-0-59905";"Let's follow the Dragon and find the aegis."
"204987124-0-59906";"What did he offer you?"
"204987124-0-59907";"What made you quit?"
"204987124-0-59908";"Vijari was calling to ""Dak'radhi"" at the Wall of Life. Any idea why?"
"204987124-0-59909";"You still plan to soak in the springs?"
"204987124-0-59910";"How do we energize the aeonstones?"
"204987124-0-59913";"So you want me study it?"
"204987124-0-59915";"My vitality? I hope you know what you're doing, Tharn."
"204987124-0-59916";"And you think Kaalgrontiid needs the stone to finish his ascension?"
"204987124-0-59918";"If the smugglers aren't driven out, won't the cove become polluted again?"
"204987124-0-59921";"How will that help?"
"204987124-0-59923";"Who is Lorkhaj?"
"204987124-0-59924";"So Ra'khajin is a Dragon Priest for Laatvulon."
"204987124-0-59925";"Why did this woman give the stone to J'saad?"
"204987124-0-59937";"Tell me more about the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-0-59938";"We came because we thought you were going to attack Senchal. Who is Laatvulon?"
"204987124-0-59939";"So you aren't going to attack Senchal?"
"204987124-0-59941";"All right, I understand."
"204987124-0-59942";"And how does the Order of the New Moon fit into these plans?"
"204987124-0-59944";"Tell me more about Ra'khajin."
"204987124-0-59945";"What did you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-59947";"All right, let's head to the balcony."
"204987124-0-59948";"What is the Wall of Life?"
"204987124-0-59949";"Will that make it easier for the dro-m'Athra to take him?"
"204987124-0-59950";"Is Black Heights your home?"
"204987124-0-59951";"So Kaalgrontiid hasn't completed his ascension?"
"204987124-0-59953";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-59954";"What is your relationship to Ka'ishka and Vijari?"
"204987124-0-59955";"What is the Dark Behind the World?"
"204987124-0-59956";"This'll be just like old times."
"204987124-0-59957";"This'll be just like old times."
"204987124-0-59958";"What is the Kaaz Kaal Sul?"
"204987124-0-59959";"The Dragonguard is going to protect Pridehome, with or without your help."
"204987124-0-59960";"Is his pilgrimage that important?"
"204987124-0-59961";"What makes it holy ground?"
"204987124-0-59962";"She and I cleansed a temple of dro-m'Athra once before. It was a great risk."
"204987124-0-59963";"What can you tell me about the Wall of Life?"
"204987124-0-59964";"And if he passes before then?"
"204987124-0-59965";"Vijari is your husband, right?"
"204987124-0-59966";"Vijari is your husband, right?"
"204987124-0-59967";"Vijari is your husband, right?"
"204987124-0-59968";"For others?"
"204987124-0-59969";"Then where are these warriors? Why aren't they defending Pridehome?"
"204987124-0-59970";"All right, I'll search for the Clan Mother."
"204987124-0-59972";"What's calling to you?"
"204987124-0-59973";"Is there no cure for your affliction?"
"204987124-0-59974";"It was the Wall that was turning you into a Bent Cat."
"204987124-0-59975";"Was it your mother's voice you heard?"
"204987124-0-59978";"What do you mean your mother never saw the Wall?"
"204987124-0-59980";"Was Vijari close to his father?"
"204987124-0-59983";"He's lucky to have you by his side. He needs your strength to keep fighting the darkness."
"204987124-0-59984";"Clan Mother Hizuni?"
"204987124-0-59988";"I'll leave you to it then."
"204987124-0-59989";"You have no idea what Abnur Tharn wants to meet about?"
"204987124-0-59990";"You have no idea what Abnur Tharn wants to meet about?"
"204987124-0-59991";"You said Nahfahlaar is acting strangely. How, exactly?"
"204987124-0-59992";"So you know how to use the claw to get us to Dragonhold?"
"204987124-0-59993";"Here's Khunzar-ri's claw."
"204987124-0-59995";"So the Moon-Priests of Pridehome helped Vashu-Pir defeat a Dragon?"
"204987124-0-59996";"Let's talk about our Dragon ally. How is Nahfahlaar doing?"
"204987124-0-59997";"I can try. Now, what do you know about Pridehome?"
"204987124-0-59998";"Will the Senchal Shields help us fight?"
"204987124-0-60000";"Isn't that a reason to help us?"
"204987124-0-60003";"I need to get the mask before Ra'khajin does."
"204987124-0-60005";"Clan Mother Hizuni asked me to find the mask. Would you deny her dying wish?"
"204987124-0-60007";"I'll head there at once."
"204987124-0-60009";"All right. Any idea where I can find this Khajiit, Zurnash?"
"204987124-0-60014";"This alliance isn't just about defeating Laatvulon. We also need to protect Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-60022";"What all did you do for Za'ji?"
"204987124-0-60023";"Cabin Man?"
"204987124-0-60024";"I'll let Sai Sahan know what we discovered."
"204987124-0-60027";"You're probably right. Let's see if we can find him."
"204987124-0-60030";"Do you have any theories on what this ritual was supposed to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-60031";"Any idea who the benefactor is?"
"204987124-0-60033";"Turning stones and looking for what?"
"204987124-0-60035";"So, I'm really just protecting your client's investments."
"204987124-0-60037";"How's that coming along?"
"204987124-0-60039";"Have you found anything else that might help?"
"204987124-0-60040";"How does it kill people?"
"204987124-0-60042";"Your client really thinks she can cure these people?"
"204987124-0-60047";"And talk of a curse didn't bother you?"
"204987124-0-60054";"Connected how?"
"204987124-0-60055";"They seem difficult to pin down."
"204987124-0-60057";"You said Nahfahlaar was acting strangely. How, exactly?"
"204987124-0-60058";"What do you think is about to happen?"
"204987124-0-60059";"What do you think is about to happen?"
"204987124-0-60060";"Then why not deliver it yourself?"
"204987124-0-60061";"You said your product spoils quickly?"
"204987124-0-60062";"How will I recognize your customers?"
"204987124-0-60063";"Are you hiring me to do something illegal?"
"204987124-0-60066";"Fair enough."
"204987124-0-60069";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-60071";"What else can you tell me?"
"204987124-0-60073";"Why did the mask fail Ja'darri?"
"204987124-0-60074";"What does the herbalist usually charge you for the remedy?"
"204987124-0-60075";"The herbalist only asked me to deliver the remedy. He didn't say anything about collecting payment."
"204987124-0-60078";"Tell me more about this divine mask."
"204987124-0-60079";"What sort of powers does the mask impart?"
"204987124-0-60080";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60081";"So you're not exactly sure what power it contains?"
"204987124-0-60082";"All right. What can you tell me about the Halls of the Highmane?"
"204987124-0-60083";"So the Halls of the Highmane contain trials that I must complete to prove myself worthy of the mask."
"204987124-0-60084";"Do you know anything more about this divine mask?"
"204987124-0-60089";"I'll search the camp for clues."
"204987124-0-60090";"You said your guard chased after the thieves?"
"204987124-0-60091";"Why the secrecy?"
"204987124-0-60092";"Your customers are grateful."
"204987124-0-60093";"Whatever you think of yourself, you're helping others."
"204987124-0-60097";"What was that you mentioned about focal points?"
"204987124-0-60098";"So then why won't the other Dragons help us stop him?"
"204987124-0-60099";"And why are you curious about this?"
"204987124-0-60100";"What about the Shields of Senchal? That's the largest fighting force in Pellitine, right?"
"204987124-0-60101";"Caska and I saw an altar surrounded by a strange green stone. That's probably where we should start."
"204987124-0-60103";"Are you sure you want to go after the smuggler heading to Senchal?"
"204987124-0-60104";"Zhasim was worried about you, too."
"204987124-0-60105";"Are you sure you want to go after the smuggler heading to Senchal?"
"204987124-0-60108";"So, you like Zhasim, too?"
"204987124-0-60110";"I have a feeling you'll find it exciting enough."
"204987124-0-60112";"It will be good to have a personal caravan guard along for the help."
"204987124-0-60119";"So will you allow Zhasim and Maezi to establish a trade route to Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-60122";"So, you lost the fight?"
"204987124-0-60123";"What can you tell me about your friends, Tajahir and Marekki?"
"204987124-0-60124";"I bet Darien would get a real kick out of that story."
"204987124-0-60125";"And Tajahir?"
"204987124-0-60126";"So, do you know anything at all about this exhibition you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-60127";"Then again what?"
"204987124-0-60129";"So, how did you get kidnapped anyway?"
"204987124-0-60133";"We should at least try to learn why the cult attacked Pridehome."
"204987124-0-60135";"Fair enough. Let's track down Selloe in Senchal."
"204987124-0-60137";"A legend?"
"204987124-0-60138";"I see where Alkosh comes into the story, but what about Khenarthi?"
"204987124-0-60139";"Not that I'm aware of."
"204987124-0-60142";"First, could you explain to me how you wound up in that sack?"
"204987124-0-60144";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-60146";"So Khenarthi guided this warrior to Alkosh's realm."
"204987124-0-60148";"You did the research, not me."
"204987124-0-60149";"Have you discovered anything about the storm?"
"204987124-0-60150";"I need to find him."
"204987124-0-60154";"And after that?"
"204987124-0-60156";"Which way did they go?"
"204987124-0-60157";"That's a big change of climate for Marekki. Do you think she'd like it up there?"
"204987124-0-60159";"What?"
"204987124-0-60161";"What will you do after that?"
"204987124-0-60163";"Just be careful. In some places you will be quite a curiosity."
"204987124-0-60164";"Couldn't you have spent your gold on restoring the city itself?"
"204987124-0-60166";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-60167";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-60168";"Sounds ambitious."
"204987124-0-60170";"Best of luck."
"204987124-0-60172";"How are things in Abah's Landing? Have you stepped into any more dye pots?"
"204987124-0-60173";"How are things in Abah's Landing? Have you stepped into any more dye pots?"
"204987124-0-60174";"Is Zeira still running things?"
"204987124-0-60175";"Has the tapestry always been here in the palace?"
"204987124-0-60176";"Has the tapestry always been here in the palace?"
"204987124-0-60177";"What did you do in Rimmen and Rawl'kha?"
"204987124-0-60181";"How do you feel about Za'ji being your captain?"
"204987124-0-60182";"Wasn't the Potentate assassinated?"
"204987124-0-60183";"Just like Cyrodiil? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60184";"So why the change of heart?"
"204987124-0-60185";"Do the Senchal Khajiit welcome you, being a Dark Elf and all?"
"204987124-0-60186";"Wasn't he murdered? Didn't the Morag Tong write their name in his blood on the walls?"
"204987124-0-60187";"Wasn't the Potentate assassinated?"
"204987124-0-60188";"Wasn't the Potentate assassinated?"
"204987124-0-60189";"And what aid can the Shields of Senchal offer our Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-60191";"And what about Senchal? Can you still defend the city while helping us?"
"204987124-0-60192";"You don't have to come with us. You could stay in Senchal."
"204987124-0-60196";"Accept the Queen's offer. Senchal needs the Shields, and the Shields need support."
"204987124-0-60199";"No. Laatvulon means to destroy all of Tamriel and start a new order of Dragon rule."
"204987124-0-60200";"Why have you decided to join us now?"
"204987124-0-60201";"How do I participate?"
"204987124-0-60203";"I'm not sure, either. The mask hasn't done anything yet."
"204987124-0-60204";"How did you convince your father to join us?"
"204987124-0-60205";"Sounds as if you rather like it."
"204987124-0-60208";"Let's talk about Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-60210";"Such as?"
"204987124-0-60211";"If Laatvulon wanted the mask, he must have known how to use it."
"204987124-0-60212";"He's strong and quick. I'm sure he'll provide a real challenge."
"204987124-0-60213";"You're an artist?"
"204987124-0-60214";"I meant no offense."
"204987124-0-60221";"What were you expecting to find?"
"204987124-0-60222";"Why won't he pay you?"
"204987124-0-60224";"Skooma? What will you do with it?"
"204987124-0-60226";"You should have let him know there was nothing out here. He shouldn't have to pay."
"204987124-0-60228";"It's not his fault that your notes don't match reality. Pay him what you promised."
"204987124-0-60230";"What goods do your ships carry?"
"204987124-0-60233";"I was hoping to use the mask in our next battle, but I haven't felt any of Alkosh's power in it."
"204987124-0-60234";"And you believe that Nahfahlaar was this powerful red Dragon?"
"204987124-0-60235";"Do you encourage all patrons to rob the bank?"
"204987124-0-60237";"Let's talk about Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-60238";"General Renmus and Sai Sahan also plan to march north and follow the cult."
"204987124-0-60241";"Were they in love?"
"204987124-0-60242";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-60243";"No, what's the Black Moon?"
"204987124-0-60244";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-60245";"Isn't this a love story?"
"204987124-0-60247";"But she didn't marry him, did she?"
"204987124-0-60248";"Did they succeed?"
"204987124-0-60249";"How did he meet with Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-0-60250";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60251";"This part of Senchal doesn't look so bad."
"204987124-0-60252";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60253";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-60255";"What was it?"
"204987124-0-60257";"No, what happened?"
"204987124-0-60258";"Did they meet in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-60260";"What will the Shields do if Dragons attack Senchal?"
"204987124-0-60261";"What did he do next?"
"204987124-0-60262";"Khunzar-ri was killed by a friend?"
"204987124-0-60263";"I thought this was a sad story?"
"204987124-0-60265";"How did Khunzar-ri convince her?"
"204987124-0-60266";"She joined his cause because of a sweetroll?"
"204987124-0-60267";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-60269";"His body parts?"
"204987124-0-60270";"His words are a treasure?"
"204987124-0-60271";"I wouldn't call being cheerful a flaw, either."
"204987124-0-60272";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-60273";"Where was it?"
"204987124-0-60275";"The Betrayer's severed hand killed him?"
"204987124-0-60277";"Senchal does seem like an odd choice."
"204987124-0-60278";"And the other time?"
"204987124-0-60279";"How powerful are the echoes?"
"204987124-0-60281";"Where can I find the gem?"
"204987124-0-60282";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-60284";"How do I participate?"
"204987124-0-60286";"How do I participate?"
"204987124-0-60288";"Rewards, eh? How can I help?"
"204987124-0-60291";"You enjoy killing creatures?"
"204987124-0-60292";"Are you a mercenary for hire?"
"204987124-0-60293";"How did you get into this line of work?"
"204987124-0-60294";"You enjoy killing creatures?"
"204987124-0-60295";"What do we know about Laatvulon?"
"204987124-0-60296";"But can we win?"
"204987124-0-60297";"We won't know until the battle is done."
"204987124-0-60298";"You and Za'ji were able to take down a Dragon before."
"204987124-0-60299";"We don't have one."
"204987124-0-60300";"And what does Laatvulon want?"
"204987124-0-60301";"So this aeonstone makes Laatvuon and his Dragon followers more powerful?"
"204987124-0-60302";"And then the cult captured Yahgrondu in an aeonstone mine."
"204987124-0-60303";"What has the cult done so far?"
"204987124-0-60304";"The Mask of Alkosh. I was able to find the mask and kill Ra'khajin."
"204987124-0-60305";"That was when you asked me to infiltrate the cult."
"204987124-0-60306";"What do we know about Laatvulon?"
"204987124-0-60307";"Tell me more about aeonstone."
"204987124-0-60309";"Even after your last breath. After all, you returned after sacrificing yourself in Coldharbour."
"204987124-0-60310";"But we came here to kill the Dragon."
"204987124-0-60311";"Let's go over what we know about the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-0-60312";"Let's go over what we know about the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-0-60313";"Let's go over what we know about the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-0-60314";"Anything else I should know before I do this?"
"204987124-0-60315";"Wasn't your mother angry you neglected your duties in the temple?"
"204987124-0-60319";"Just keep your bow steady."
"204987124-0-60320";"I'll learn all I can."
"204987124-0-60321";"Any tips for the battle ahead, Caska the Unconquered?"
"204987124-0-60323";"We have what we have, Za'ji. You'll have to make do."
"204987124-0-60324";"The Dragonguard needs you here."
"204987124-0-60326";"What request would that be?"
"204987124-0-60327";"Something that involved the Mask of Alkosh."
"204987124-0-60328";"Nahfahlaar may be able to tell us more."
"204987124-0-60330";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-60332";"Is this the realm of Alkosh?"
"204987124-0-60333";"The steady beat of drums?"
"204987124-0-60334";"<Enter Falkreath Hold.>"
"204987124-0-60337";"All right, then. Can you at least tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-60338";"It doesn't seem like you're going to give me a straight answer here."
"204987124-0-60344";"<Enter Bloodroot Forge.>"
"204987124-0-60346";"I see."
"204987124-0-60347";"What did you do after you won that battle in your heart?"
"204987124-0-60348";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-60349";"I see. Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-60350";"The blood of a flightless bird, petals blue as the sky, and the skin of Khenarthi's fallen children."
"204987124-0-60352";"Do you have something you want to say?"
"204987124-0-60353";"However?"
"204987124-0-60354";"Get to the point, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-60356";"And because of that request you had the chance to join the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-60357";"You sound nervous about that."
"204987124-0-60358";"There's still plenty of reasons to fight. Dragons still plague Elsweyr."
"204987124-0-60360";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60361";"And what about you, Caska?"
"204987124-0-60362";"The Order of the New Moon did kill many."
"204987124-0-60364";"We defeated Laatvulon and his cult. They won't kill any longer."
"204987124-0-60365";"And one general's daughter."
"204987124-0-60366";"And what about you, Captain Sai Sahan?"
"204987124-0-60368";"And now?"
"204987124-0-60372";"That's why he's calling you to the Wall. He wants you to become dro-m'Athra too."
"204987124-0-60373";"Could you look at this list of ingredients and tell me if you've got any idea what I'm looking for?"
"204987124-0-60374";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"204987124-0-60375";"The blood of a flightless bird."
"204987124-0-60376";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"204987124-0-60377";"Petals, blue as the sky."
"204987124-0-60378";"The blood of a flightless bird."
"204987124-0-60379";"I need something specific. Any petals associated with numbing dreams?"
"204987124-0-60380";"Right. Then Tharn removed the island's defenses and sent me back to the surface."
"204987124-0-60385";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-60389";"There was also a ghost cat. Maybe an Alfiq? It did something to you, I think."
"204987124-0-60392";"I'll do all I can."
"204987124-0-60393";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-60397";"And what happens if I get on her bad side?"
"204987124-0-60398";"Let's get back to the topic at hand. Why do you think Nartise stole your ship?"
"204987124-0-60399";"And you're sure all this will help us get an appointment with the general?"
"204987124-0-60400";"Let's get to it."
"204987124-0-60401";"More resistance? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60402";"Do you regret giving your horn to the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-0-60403";"Banished with the Darkness."
"204987124-0-60404";"Go in peace, Vijari."
"204987124-0-60405";"Go in peace, Vijari."
"204987124-0-60407";"It seems like you're ready for the worst."
"204987124-0-60409";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-60410";"Is there anything you can tell me?"
"204987124-0-60411";"Are you saying that Alkosh brought Sai Sahan back so he could help me come here?"
"204987124-0-60412";"Sai Sahan. He sacrificed his life to the amulet. He came back to life, but he's not sure how."
"204987124-0-60413";"I see. Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-60414";"I see. Can you tell me more about this place?"
"204987124-0-60415";"So who's going to walk the Jonelight Path with you?"
"204987124-0-60416";"What's the difference between hunter and Ahkahtuz?"
"204987124-0-60418";"I'd like to know more about Ja'darri."
"204987124-0-60419";"And now we're negotiating with a Dragon."
"204987124-0-60420";"Do you still have the piece you took?"
"204987124-0-60422";"Why won't the other Dragons help us stop Kaalgrontiid?"
"204987124-0-60424";"Perhaps I will."
"204987124-0-60425";"And do you think they're qualified to hunt Dragons?"
"204987124-0-60426";"You seem to have much confidence in your crew."
"204987124-0-60427";"Tell me more about Dirge Truptor and Chizbari. Why might their talents interest me?"
"204987124-0-60428";"I'll speak with Nahfahlaar and meet you at Pridehome."
"204987124-0-60430";"Legion? So, Imperial?"
"204987124-0-60431";"Why don't the Shields take care of the problems you're assigning out?"
"204987124-0-60432";"So, why is a temple guardian protecting the dust?"
"204987124-0-60438";"I'll speak with Renmus and see what he knows about Nahfahlaar and Latvulon."
"204987124-0-60441";"All right, I'll use the grappling bow to reach the alcove and search for the key."
"204987124-0-60442";"All right, I'll use the grappling bow to reach the alcove and search for the key."
"204987124-0-60443";"Is that why you left Black Heights for good? Because you thought your mother wanted you gone?"
"204987124-0-60446";"Yes, I do."
"204987124-0-60447";"All right, you can follow me."
"204987124-0-60448";"What's your relationship with Sai Sahan?"
"204987124-0-60450";"Where in the cove can we find Bahzahar?"
"204987124-0-60451";"Which parts did you want me to bring back?"
"204987124-0-60453";"I'll take a look."
"204987124-0-60457";"Lahini joined the cult to stop being a burden to you?"
"204987124-0-60462";"If you're absolutely sure."
"204987124-0-60465";"And what's the Order of the New Moon doing here?"
"204987124-0-60467";"What do you mean by thrive?"
"204987124-0-60469";"Me too."
"204987124-0-60470";"Did you ever try to escape?"
"204987124-0-60471";"Fair enough. Did you ever try to escape?"
"204987124-0-60472";"What can you tell me about your cat, Winks?"
"204987124-0-60473";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-60474";"Tell me about Ra'khajin."
"204987124-0-60475";"If I make my way through this path, I'll be allowed to join the Order of the New Moon?"
"204987124-0-60476";"What can you tell me about your friends, Tajahir and Marekki?"
"204987124-0-60477";"What should I tell her about Jano?"
"204987124-0-60479";"If we broke the curse, why do all these undead remain?"
"204987124-0-60481";"Your mother is heartbroken. She's worried that you're hurt, possibly dead."
"204987124-0-60486";"You said these caravaners were criminals. What else do you know about them?"
"204987124-0-60487";"So, how will these goods help you and Safik escape?"
"204987124-0-60488";"How will you hide all of the damage to the tapestry?"
"204987124-0-60489";"And Silver-Claw?"
"204987124-0-60490";"Can you protect him?"
"204987124-0-60491";"Do you think she'll go through with it and tell Turo?"
"204987124-0-60493";"I'll help you with your exorcism."
"204987124-0-60494";"All right. I'll ask Za'ji if he and his crew want to join the Dragonguard."
"204987124-0-60497";"All right, let's return to Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-60498";"All right, let's return to Sai Sahan."
"204987124-0-60500";"What will you do with the stone?"
"204987124-0-60505";"You'd rather leave again?"
"204987124-0-60506";"Best of luck with all your plans."
"204987124-0-60507";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-60508";"Enjoy your stay then."
"204987124-0-60510";"What does Turo store in there?"
"204987124-0-60511";"Special how?"
"204987124-0-60512";"What kind of attack?"
"204987124-0-60513";"Before we go, tell me more about the magic Jorunn's wizards provided. (Do Not Fast Travel)"
"204987124-0-60514";"I'll talk to Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-60516";"Why do you think this special treatment was a burden to Ra'khajin?"
"204987124-0-60517";"What kind of attack?"
"204987124-0-60518";"Before we go, tell me more about the magic Jorunn's wizards provided. (Do Not Fast Travel)"
"204987124-0-60519";"If the smugglers aren't driven out, won't the cove become polluted again?"
"204987124-0-60529";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-60530";"Do what you have to and finish this, Tharn."
"204987124-0-60531";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-60532";"What was the Soulburst, exactly?"
"204987124-0-60534";"Then let's go to the meeting place."
"204987124-0-60535";"What have you been doing in Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-60536";"There's something you need to know. Sai Sahan is alive."
"204987124-0-60537";"Home?"
"204987124-0-60538";"There's something you need to know. Sai Sahan is alive."
"204987124-0-60539";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-60540";"I saw him. It's him. He doesn't know how he survived, but he's alive."
"204987124-0-60541";"What have you been up to since we defeated Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-60547";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-60549";"I'll help you investigate the coven. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-60555";"Can you help him?"
"204987124-0-60556";"Tharn saved us all, but I can't help but wonder what comes next."
"204987124-0-60558";"I'll help you with your exorcism."
"204987124-0-60560";"Why do I need to check in with General Renmus?"
"204987124-0-60561";"I'll meet Aeliah at the Senchal palace then."
"204987124-0-60562";"You want Yahgrondu to join us?"
"204987124-0-60564";"I'll speak to a companion who is familiar with Elsweyr and search for Yahgrondu."
"204987124-0-60565";"Where are these dro-m'Athra coming from?"
"204987124-0-60566";"You can't drive the darkness out of them like Vijari?"
"204987124-0-60567";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-60568";"Do you think she'll stay in Black Heights now that he's gone?"
"204987124-0-60569";"You think that would work?"
"204987124-0-60570";"So Dak'radhi could come back."
"204987124-0-60571";"Where are you headed next?"
"204987124-0-60572";"What about Ka'ishka?"
"204987124-0-60573";"What about Ka'ishka?"
"204987124-0-60574";"What will you do now that Vijari is gone?"
"204987124-0-60576";"Do you think you'll stay in Black Heights?"
"204987124-0-60577";"I can understand why you wouldn't want to be reminded of that."
"204987124-0-60578";"You want to become a Twilight Cantor?"
"204987124-0-60580";"If that's what you want, I'm sure Adara'hai can guide you."
"204987124-0-60581";"What was Kaalgrontiid really trying to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-60582";"Farewell, Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-60583";"How is that supposed to help us?"
"204987124-0-60586";"The only words I could make out were ""a lucrative opportunity."""
"204987124-0-60588";"I'll see if I can learn anything at these locations."
"204987124-0-60589";"What kind of promises?"
"204987124-0-60590";"But we were able to stop Ra'khajin before he obtained the mask."
"204987124-0-60591";"Your departure? Are you leaving?"
"204987124-0-60592";"And I was then able to use the mask to defeat Laatvulon as well."
"204987124-0-60594";"Why would they want to harvest life energy?"
"204987124-0-60596";"Could that be what they're going to use to make the harrowstorms stronger?"
"204987124-0-60598";"And that's where we can find the refined netherroot brew."
"204987124-0-60600";"Three camps. That's a lot of ground to cover."
"204987124-0-60601";"I have the Mask of Alkosh. I faced the Halls of the Highmane and proved myself worthy."
"204987124-0-60602";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60603";"What do we know about the midlands camp?"
"204987124-0-60604";"Tell me about the coastal camp."
"204987124-0-60605";"What's so special about this camp?"
"204987124-0-60608";"I'll help you reach the center of the camp."
"204987124-0-60609";"Tell me more about the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-60610";"What was she like?"
"204987124-0-60611";"A great hunger? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60612";"I found this piece of a ritual item."
"204987124-0-60613";"Any idea where we go next?"
"204987124-0-60616";"All right. I'm ready to depart. (Fast Travel to Riften)"
"204987124-0-60618";"You've called me something several times now. Ahkahtuz. What does it mean?"
"204987124-0-60619";"It sounds like you respect her greatly."
"204987124-0-60621";"You've called me something several times now. Ahkahtuz. What does it mean?"
"204987124-0-60622";"And what about Aeliah? Will you ask her to join you?"
"204987124-0-60624";"So, you'll still be an outlaw."
"204987124-0-60625";"No, it was a ghost."
"204987124-0-60626";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-60628";"Right. I'll stand back and stay out of the way."
"204987124-0-60630";"So they toss you in a sack?"
"204987124-0-60631";"Right. I'll get you back to your family."
"204987124-0-60632";"What do you think happened to them?"
"204987124-0-60635";"Do you think it will last?"
"204987124-0-60637";"Do you think he's meeting the Icereach Coven down here?"
"204987124-0-60639";"Help with what?"
"204987124-0-60640";"Did you confront this Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-60642";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60644";"Open the door and I'll get your flask."
"204987124-0-60646";"Western Skyrim is a long way from Rivenspire."
"204987124-0-60649";"They all shared something in common when they were alive."
"204987124-0-60652";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-60653";"And you have a plan for that?"
"204987124-0-60655";"I have another idea. Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"204987124-0-60656";"I have another idea. Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"204987124-0-60657";"I have another idea. Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"204987124-0-60658";"All of the exhumed corpses had the same name."
"204987124-0-60659";"I have another idea. Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"204987124-0-60660";"The natural decay of life?"
"204987124-0-60661";"They all died of the same cause."
"204987124-0-60664";"We learned more about the medallions at the coastal camp. Fenn's on his way back to the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-60666";"This flier mentions an inn in Eastmarch."
"204987124-0-60671";"But he doesn't."
"204987124-0-60672";"Fenn needs the refined netherroot brew for his elixir."
"204987124-0-60673";"What do you know about this place?"
"204987124-0-60675";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-60676";"Do you remember who this person was?"
"204987124-0-60677";"Just get the high king to hear us out and we'll take care of the rest."
"204987124-0-60681";"Juisa wasn't kidding. You really do get into a lot of trouble."
"204987124-0-60683";"Fair point. Just be careful next time you go out drinking."
"204987124-0-60684";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-60690";"You seem to have grown fond of Fenn and Svana."
"204987124-0-60693";"We learned more about the medallions at the coastal camp. Fenn's on his way back to the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-60695";"We need to try to find out about the big storm the Gray Host is planning."
"204987124-0-60697";"Tell me what you noticed while scouting around the camp."
"204987124-0-60698";"Let's go find your captain and crew."
"204987124-0-60700";"He makes it sound like he considers his army to be his family."
"204987124-0-60704";"Exploitable? How so?"
"204987124-0-60708";"What will the ritual tell us?"
"204987124-0-60712";"Why did High King Svargrim want all of the sacred oil?"
"204987124-0-60714";"Do you know where the swordthane took Arkay's sacred oil?"
"204987124-0-60716";"There's an elixir that protects against harrowstorms, but it requires the sacred oil."
"204987124-0-60717";"Tell me about this warding spell."
"204987124-0-60718";"What went wrong?"
"204987124-0-60720";"I understand."
"204987124-0-60721";"Who do you think is waiting for you?"
"204987124-0-60722";"What's so special about the locket?"
"204987124-0-60723";"So you tried to find another focus?"
"204987124-0-60724";"Why do you think Honoria left?"
"204987124-0-60725";"It turned the other legionaries into undead?"
"204987124-0-60726";"Honoria's daughter suffers vivid dreams of you writing that letter."
"204987124-0-60727";"Tell me about this warding spell."
"204987124-0-60728";"Should?"
"204987124-0-60729";"Why would Freiwen want to haunt you?"
"204987124-0-60730";"You're going to make potions out of Dragon spit?"
"204987124-0-60731";"Tell me more about this warding spell."
"204987124-0-60732";"How fresh do these bones need to be?"
"204987124-0-60733";"Dragons eat horses?"
"204987124-0-60735";"How fresh do these bones need to be?"
"204987124-0-60737";"Right, the orders mentioned the Undergrove is hidden in an ancient barrow."
"204987124-0-60741";"I guess we're going to the Midnight Barrow."
"204987124-0-60746";"You don't seem impressed."
"204987124-0-60748";"Could you teach me some of your traditions?"
"204987124-0-60749";"Fair enough. I'll tell Catina what I witnessed."
"204987124-0-60751";"She feared what the spell would do to you. You rested in her womb at the time. Jano was your father."
"204987124-0-60757";"How do we stop your curse?"
"204987124-0-60759";"I will convey your message to Lady Ninetha."
"204987124-0-60761";"I'll meet you at the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-60766";"That makes sense."
"204987124-0-60768";"I'm sure he'll be fine. Enjoy your stay here."
"204987124-0-60769";"What happens to Freiwen next? She killed many people."
"204987124-0-60771";"Important business? And what friend?"
"204987124-0-60773";"I'll talk to Nahfahlaar."
"204987124-0-60774";"You have no idea what Abnur Tharn wants to meet about?"
"204987124-0-60779";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-60782";"What are we looking for?"
"204987124-0-60783";"High King Svargrim sent orders?"
"204987124-0-60785";"Sounds like the Icereach Coven's ritual items. Tell me about the Reachmen you encountered."
"204987124-0-60786";"Princess Svana has been trying to convince her father to take action against this threat."
"204987124-0-60787";"You have a daughter?"
"204987124-0-60789";"You don't approve?"
"204987124-0-60790";"You think this is Blackreach?"
"204987124-0-60791";"Hrolt mentioned other prisoners and said he saw witch pikes."
"204987124-0-60793";"All right, I'll explore Blackreach and see what I can find out."
"204987124-0-60794";"The storm has stopped. You should be safe now."
"204987124-0-60796";"Will you stop her?"
"204987124-0-60798";"Give her my best."
"204987124-0-60799";"Sister Balra? Do you know where she is?"
"204987124-0-60800";"The flier? Is that how you wound up down here?"
"204987124-0-60802";"Hrolt is safe. Meet up with your companions. I'll deal with Sister Balra."
"204987124-0-60807";"I found notes describing some sort of ritual."
"204987124-0-60808";"Sister Balra, from the Ratway, is in charge here. She might be in the nearby Dwarven ruins."
"204987124-0-60810";"Right behind you."
"204987124-0-60811";"Yes, if I had to."
"204987124-0-60812";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-60813";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-60814";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-60815";"Any idea where we're going to find the ritual site?"
"204987124-0-60817";"What kind of danger?"
"204987124-0-60821";"What do you think about High King Svargrim?"
"204987124-0-60822";"How do we stop the harrowstorm?"
"204987124-0-60823";"I'm ready. (Fast Travel to Windhelm)"
"204987124-0-60826";"What do you think we'll find beneath the city?"
"204987124-0-60828";"We'll do our best."
"204987124-0-60831";"I found the people you sent me for. Hjolt is safe, Roligmolf is dead, and the other …."
"204987124-0-60833";"Let's head to the temple."
"204987124-0-60834";"One of your sentries accepted a bribe and told the Icereach Coven how to gain access to the palace."
"204987124-0-60836";"Yes, and they may already be moving against the Skald-King. We need to get into the palace."
"204987124-0-60837";"You should leave the temple before those creatures find you."
"204987124-0-60839";"We'll go to the catacombs. You need to get out of here."
"204987124-0-60840";"The coven appears to be allied with vampires."
"204987124-0-60842";"The coven seems interested in the Haafingar hold."
"204987124-0-60844";"Yes, Skald-King."
"204987124-0-60845";"So who rules the two kingdoms?"
"204987124-0-60847";"What do you plan to do while you're waiting for the Skald-King?"
"204987124-0-60848";"So that's why the soldiers became harrowfiends?"
"204987124-0-60850";"I'll see you at the jarl's hall."
"204987124-0-60851";"We destroyed a witch pike and dealt with the Reachmen, but one of the coven witches got away."
"204987124-0-60853";"As soon as we find out where the coven leaders are hiding, Svana will send word."
"204987124-0-60854";"All right. Let's head into Karthwatch."
"204987124-0-60856";"Tell me about this alternative."
"204987124-0-60860";"What relic?"
"204987124-0-60862";"I'll get to the chamberlain's sanctum and find the key."
"204987124-0-60864";"All right, let's head into Karthwatch."
"204987124-0-60866";"So that means …?"
"204987124-0-60869";"What's the purpose of a giant witch pike? And how do we destroy it?"
"204987124-0-60870";"Is there anything else important in that book?"
"204987124-0-60873";"Here are the Meridian Medallions I retrieved."
"204987124-0-60875";"What about Jarl Olfwenn? Is she still alive?"
"204987124-0-60877";"I'll try to find Jarl Olfwenn."
"204987124-0-60880";"So High King Svargrim is finally taking our warning seriously?"
"204987124-0-60882";"We reached Karthwatch too late. It was destroyed by a harrowstorm."
"204987124-0-60884";"How did people turn into zombies?"
"204987124-0-60885";"You said the high king is locked in his tower?"
"204987124-0-60887";"You said the high king is locked in his tower?"
"204987124-0-60888";"You said the high king is locked in his tower?"
"204987124-0-60889";"How did you and Maugh meet?"
"204987124-0-60890";"Did Solitude need another tower?"
"204987124-0-60891";"What happens to Karthald now that Jarl Olfwenn is dead?"
"204987124-0-60894";"We certainly are. Let's go find Fenn."
"204987124-0-60896";"How would you do that?"
"204987124-0-60899";"I've witnessed some concerning things since I arrived here, your majesty."
"204987124-0-60900";"There's evidence of Reachmen activity around Solitude."
"204987124-0-60902";"We'll find that proof, your majesty."
"204987124-0-60903";"Here's everything I found."
"204987124-0-60905";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-60906";"All right. Anyone have any idea where we're going to find this stuff?"
"204987124-0-60911";"Brondold's dead because of what's in those crates. They'll come for you, too."
"204987124-0-60912";"I'll talk to Kasalla. Thanks."
"204987124-0-60914";"I'll try to find this Edjar then."
"204987124-0-60915";"We wanted to ask if he saw the people putting up the job postings."
"204987124-0-60916";"Thank you, your highness."
"204987124-0-60919";"You remember anything else about this charmer?"
"204987124-0-60921";"Where were you when the storm appeared?"
"204987124-0-60923";"What's the situation in Karthwatch now?"
"204987124-0-60924";"Any idea where they went?"
"204987124-0-60925";"I'm ready to go to the smuggler's warehouse."
"204987124-0-60927";"Fenn's gone missing. Tell me what the two of you were doing so I can find him."
"204987124-0-60939";"Reachmen captured people?"
"204987124-0-60940";"I can search for the survivors with you."
"204987124-0-60941";"Alone? Where were you in the fight?"
"204987124-0-60942";"Why did you come to the barrow?"
"204987124-0-60944";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-60948";"Why would they want her back?"
"204987124-0-60949";"Does Bjora know she's from the Reach?"
"204987124-0-60950";"And that door will get us to wherever Exarch Tzinghalis is holding Fenn?"
"204987124-0-60951";"Go meet Priest Bavian and the others in the cave to the southeast. I'll check on Priest Direnna."
"204987124-0-60953";"Why would she be the subject of scorn?"
"204987124-0-60956";"Does Bjora know she's from the Reach?"
"204987124-0-60958";"All right, Edjar. Thank you for your help."
"204987124-0-60964";"Any other suggestions?"
"204987124-0-60965";"The other survivors mentioned the Reachmen taking Bjora to witches."
"204987124-0-60968";"They told you that you're a Reachman?"
"204987124-0-60970";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-60971";"What is your plan?"
"204987124-0-60974";"Bjora mentioned the witches' stone circles."
"204987124-0-60975";"Svana wants to do this. No one is forcing her."
"204987124-0-60976";"I'll keep Svana safe, Maugh. I give you my word."
"204987124-0-60980";"What should I say?"
"204987124-0-60982";"The jewel of blue rues virtue."
"204987124-0-60983";"What else did you see?"
"204987124-0-60984";"Who purchased it? I'd like a word with them."
"204987124-0-60986";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-60987";"Hafskjar and I rescued several people. They've gathered outside town."
"204987124-0-60988";"The witches spoke of a prophecy that you were meant to lead the Reachmen."
"204987124-0-60990";"You mean undead?"
"204987124-0-60991";"I'll keep an eye out."
"204987124-0-60992";"You said they stole a lantern of some kind?"
"204987124-0-60993";"I imagine it would. Can I really trust you not to bite us?"
"204987124-0-60994";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-60995";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-60996";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-60997";"I was late and missed the bidding. Can I make you this offer?"
"204987124-0-60999";"Glad we could come to an agreement."
"204987124-0-61000";"I rescued Edjar's pack. He helped us find you."
"204987124-0-61002";"Can you use what you learned from Edjar to develop a defense?"
"204987124-0-61005";"The lute—are you going to take it?"
"204987124-0-61007";"Thank you, I will."
"204987124-0-61008";"I'll remember that."
"204987124-0-61010";"We took a sample of refined netherroot brew from the midland camp. Lyris is bringing it to Solitude."
"204987124-0-61014";"So we might find the army's leaders in there?"
"204987124-0-61015";"Are you sure you want to continue on?"
"204987124-0-61016";"This patron could raise an army of undead?"
"204987124-0-61019";"No, just us. We need to see Kasalla."
"204987124-0-61020";"Perhaps we could wait inside?"
"204987124-0-61022";"I'm not sure, but if you get your scabbard she'd be happy to autograph it."
"204987124-0-61024";"So you've done this before?"
"204987124-0-61025";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-61027";"Who's missing?"
"204987124-0-61029";"Do you think he wandered off?"
"204987124-0-61030";"Who is Elle?"
"204987124-0-61032";"I'll talk to Elle."
"204987124-0-61034";"What about these Reach fetishes?"
"204987124-0-61035";"Who hired you to smuggle this?"
"204987124-0-61037";"I'm sure we can work something out."
"204987124-0-61038";"Should we check out that abandoned lodge?"
"204987124-0-61041";"I'll see you at the lodge."
"204987124-0-61042";"What have you learned so far?"
"204987124-0-61043";"House Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-61044";"What brought you and your sister to Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-61045";"So, how do we open the pens? I don't see any gates."
"204987124-0-61046";"Mechanism on the balcony. Got it. I'll go up and have a look."
"204987124-0-61047";"What do you think Essenia did to these vampires?"
"204987124-0-61049";"The letter said they were ready to start the ritual as soon as they received the shipment."
"204987124-0-61053";"Warn the priests? Shouldn't I attempt to stop the ritual?"
"204987124-0-61055";"I'll see you at Kilkreath Temple after you warn the high king."
"204987124-0-61056";"Are you familiar with the cavern he mentions in the letter?"
"204987124-0-61058";"What are harrowfiends? And for that matter, who are you?"
"204987124-0-61064";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-61077";"What happened when you arrived?"
"204987124-0-61081";"And Essenia selected Adusa?"
"204987124-0-61083";"A coven witch? Where?"
"204987124-0-61086";"I'll meet you up there."
"204987124-0-61087";"Essenia has other plans. That book said with an heir of Verandis, she could create something new."
"204987124-0-61090";"How do we find that?"
"204987124-0-61091";"Larger vessels?"
"204987124-0-61092";"Do you have a location in mind?"
"204987124-0-61094";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-61096";"Let's track him down."
"204987124-0-61097";"What's this all about?"
"204987124-0-61098";"We faced it together and succeeded."
"204987124-0-61101";"Who hired you?"
"204987124-0-61104";"So, she's conscripting the vampires into an army?"
"204987124-0-61106";"All right, I'll help you find your sister."
"204987124-0-61116";"Where did this man go?"
"204987124-0-61118";"Which way did the vampire flee?"
"204987124-0-61120";"The vampire assassinated Queen Gerhyld. Princess Svana asked me to track him down."
"204987124-0-61121";"Your head is probably the least of your worries once the high king hears about this."
"204987124-0-61123";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-61124";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-61127";"Who are the Reachmen and why would they attack your caravan?"
"204987124-0-61129";"You didn't find any trace of your caravan agent?"
"204987124-0-61133";"Have you heard about the harrowstorm that struck Kilkreath? It turned your people into harrowfiends."
"204987124-0-61134";"Queen Gerhyld asked us to bring you proof. That might be why the coven killed her."
"204987124-0-61137";"The Icereach Coven has come to Western Skyrim. It looks like they killed the queen."
"204987124-0-61138";"The high king won't listen to us. He thinks this is all some plot of the Skald-King."
"204987124-0-61140";"We'll do what we can, your highness."
"204987124-0-61146";"What kind of explosives?"
"204987124-0-61147";"I'll go warn the captain."
"204987124-0-61154";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-61155";"I'll gather the reagents and return soon."
"204987124-0-61158";"Do you think it will work?"
"204987124-0-61166";"At least he didn't hurt you too badly before he got away."
"204987124-0-61168";"And you think you can track the urns back to the person who requested them?"
"204987124-0-61169";"An Icereach Coven medallion. I've seen them before. You had this on you the entire time?"
"204987124-0-61170";"I don't think guard-duty is for me."
"204987124-0-61173";"With smuggler caves. They plan to collapse the cavern beneath the bridge."
"204987124-0-61174";"Fair enough. Do you really intend to rebuild the Pyre Watch?"
"204987124-0-61184";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-61186";"How do we stop them?"
"204987124-0-61189";"I'll get the fire salts and kindlepitch."
"204987124-0-61190";"Since the assassin escaped, they're probably expecting us."
"204987124-0-61192";"I'll deal with the explosives. You get to safety."
"204987124-0-61195";"Overseer Urlvar tried to confront the vampire, but it was already too late."
"204987124-0-61197";"Yes, I killed him."
"204987124-0-61198";"At least you have answers now."
"204987124-0-61200";"So how do you want to handle this?"
"204987124-0-61202";"Fenn said he'd meet us outside the far side of town."
"204987124-0-61204";"What will you be doing while we deal with the witch pikes?"
"204987124-0-61207";"We'll take care of the witch pikes."
"204987124-0-61208";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-61209";"I'll go tell Svana the news."
"204987124-0-61212";"Yes. The assassin was a vampire who was working with the Icereach Coven."
"204987124-0-61215";"The coven can summon devastating storms that wipe people's minds and turn them into monsters."
"204987124-0-61216";"I don't believe he was the one responsible for those deaths."
"204987124-0-61218";"What will you do with your ancestor's remains now?"
"204987124-0-61220";"What will you do with your ancestor's remains now?"
"204987124-0-61223";"I remember."
"204987124-0-61225";"So no major casualties?"
"204987124-0-61230";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-61231";"Jorunn sent us here to help. I don't believe he'd turn on you now."
"204987124-0-61232";"So Svana's the queen now?"
"204987124-0-61239";"If we hadn't stopped Svargrim, that might have been necessary."
"204987124-0-61240";"Will your father attempt to take Svargrim's place here?"
"204987124-0-61244";"I'll speak to King Jorunn."
"204987124-0-61246";"Do you know why?"
"204987124-0-61247";"The Gray Host caused a lot of damage. These people could use your help."
"204987124-0-61248";"Whatever you think, King Jorunn."
"204987124-0-61253";"What are you going to do now, King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-61256";"Can you tell me more about the island?"
"204987124-0-61257";"So the Nords drove them out of Skyrim, too?"
"204987124-0-61259";"Tell me more about Viggol."
"204987124-0-61261";"And you don't agree with that approach?"
"204987124-0-61263";"I'll talk to Fenn about countering the harrowstorms."
"204987124-0-61264";"Do you really think anyone survived?"
"204987124-0-61265";"Tell me more about this coven of witches. You mentioned pushing them into the sea?"
"204987124-0-61266";"Your wife is concerned that it's too dangerous."
"204987124-0-61267";"Tell me more about this coven of witches. You mentioned pushing them into the sea?"
"204987124-0-61268";"What do you need to examine the residue?"
"204987124-0-61270";"What else do you need to do out here?"
"204987124-0-61273";"All right, I'll help Bavian and return for you soon."
"204987124-0-61274";"Is drinking your answer to everything?"
"204987124-0-61278";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-61279";"He said something about the Icereach Coven at work in the west. Do you know what that means?"
"204987124-0-61281";"Understood."
"204987124-0-61282";"Brondold's dead. He left me with a handful of papers and a lot of questions."
"204987124-0-61283";"I didn't kill Brondold. Just tell me what this is all about."
"204987124-0-61285";"And did you see anything out of the ordinary?"
"204987124-0-61287";"You're part of the Skald-King's expedition to Icereach, right?"
"204987124-0-61291";"What does that medallion do?"
"204987124-0-61294";"Disrupt it how?"
"204987124-0-61295";"Have you found any other survivors?"
"204987124-0-61296";"I hear you."
"204987124-0-61298";"Have Reachmen attacked Karthwatch before?"
"204987124-0-61299";"Tell me more about the storm you saw."
"204987124-0-61300";"He certainly is. Let's go find Fenn."
"204987124-0-61301";"Where did it come from?"
"204987124-0-61303";"Do the Reachmen often take prisoners?"
"204987124-0-61304";"The town is overrun with monsters. No one is left."
"204987124-0-61305";"Why do you think they want captives now?"
"204987124-0-61307";"Are these tales true?"
"204987124-0-61308";"What did you see when the storm appeared?"
"204987124-0-61309";"What did you see when the storm appeared?"
"204987124-0-61310";"How so?"
"204987124-0-61312";"And you think ""stolen heir"" refers to Bjora? Heir to what?"
"204987124-0-61313";"Alchemy?"
"204987124-0-61315";"Where is this cage she's locked in?"
"204987124-0-61316";"Sounds risky."
"204987124-0-61317";"What did your ancestor do to deserve a traitor's burial?"
"204987124-0-61318";"Why would she hide the key?"
"204987124-0-61321";"You're really all right with possibly succumbing to a harrowstorm?"
"204987124-0-61323";"Maybe I could talk to Overseer Thulsgreg."
"204987124-0-61326";"A leader has to make the hard decisions."
"204987124-0-61329";"The author mentioned two others went to explore Dwarven ruins and never came back."
"204987124-0-61332";"Let's go find your pack."
"204987124-0-61335";"How many witches are there on this island?"
"204987124-0-61336";"We've seen a lot of undead. Are all these witches necromancers?"
"204987124-0-61337";"I'll keep the stronghold safe."
"204987124-0-61338";"Good. Now, where is the key?"
"204987124-0-61339";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-61343";"What did your ancestor do to deserve a traitor's burial?"
"204987124-0-61344";"What do you think they really want?"
"204987124-0-61345";"Why does that make you nervous?"
"204987124-0-61346";"So what are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-61347";"If you can't trust us, at least trust your daughter."
"204987124-0-61348";"We only want to help."
"204987124-0-61351";"Right, you had a theory about the effects of the harrowstorm."
"204987124-0-61352";"Have you dealt with anything like this before?"
"204987124-0-61353";"Where is Morthal?"
"204987124-0-61356";"Now, where is the key?"
"204987124-0-61358";"You think those men were trying to hide where they came from?"
"204987124-0-61360";"Why did your crew send you out here?"
"204987124-0-61362";"Where will I find your ship?"
"204987124-0-61364";"I'll see if I can find your captain and crew."
"204987124-0-61365";"Overseer Thulsgreg and Mazog think your alchemy must have caused the collapse."
"204987124-0-61366";"Are the people here that suspicious of strangers?"
"204987124-0-61367";"You think those men were trying to hide where they came from?"
"204987124-0-61368";"Tell me about the Reach."
"204987124-0-61369";"The high king seemed pretty angry to me."
"204987124-0-61371";"Do you think Mazog might have something to do with the mine collapse?"
"204987124-0-61372";"Take it. I'll meet you inside."
"204987124-0-61373";"Can you describe these monsters?"
"204987124-0-61375";"I'll find the others."
"204987124-0-61376";"You scout the route, I'll find the captives."
"204987124-0-61378";"Svargrim thinks Jorunn wants to take over his kingdom?"
"204987124-0-61379";"What we've found so far isn't enough?"
"204987124-0-61380";"What sort of proof will persuade High King Svargrim to listen?"
"204987124-0-61381";"Tell me about the Icereach Coven."
"204987124-0-61382";"The queen recognized you."
"204987124-0-61383";"Can you explain what this is all about?"
"204987124-0-61384";"All right, I'll investigate the cave-in. You get going."
"204987124-0-61386";"Sure, I can find the ingredients. How does this potion work?"
"204987124-0-61388";"Why don't you check on them?"
"204987124-0-61389";"Tell me about the storm you saw."
"204987124-0-61390";"I'll see what I can find in the barrow."
"204987124-0-61393";"Should we investigate the mining town?"
"204987124-0-61394";"You mean Maxten?"
"204987124-0-61396";"Do you have something specific in mind?"
"204987124-0-61398";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-61399";"Will you be able to survive in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-61401";"How do you feel?"
"204987124-0-61404";"He did what he set out to do."
"204987124-0-61406";"What are they?"
"204987124-0-61407";"What?"
"204987124-0-61408";"Do you think the others could have survived?"
"204987124-0-61410";"All right. I'll look for Narzba and Blograth."
"204987124-0-61412";"There's nothing I can do for the temple priests?"
"204987124-0-61416";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-61417";"Who's coming? The ones who attacked you?"
"204987124-0-61419";"Hold on!"
"204987124-0-61420";"Who hired you?"
"204987124-0-61421";"Do you know why the Reachmen are trying to blow up the mountain?"
"204987124-0-61422";"Do you know why the Reachmen are trying to blow up the mountain?"
"204987124-0-61423";"What sort of proof will persuade High King Svargrim to listen?"
"204987124-0-61424";"A soldier accused me of being a spy. Are your people always so suspicious?"
"204987124-0-61425";"Why did Jorunn send you to help Svargrim? They obviously have a bad history."
"204987124-0-61426";"Can you explain what this is all about?"
"204987124-0-61427";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-61428";"Are you sure you're up to talking to the high king?"
"204987124-0-61433";"Enjoy the rest of the auction. [Steal the Lute]"
"204987124-0-61434";"What civil war?"
"204987124-0-61436";"What were the options?"
"204987124-0-61437";"So, you said I'm saving the Bards College?"
"204987124-0-61439";"She was trying to meet Chief Urzikh's production demands while cutting time spent in the mine."
"204987124-0-61445";"Why do you think this has anything to do with mining?"
"204987124-0-61447";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-61448";"What do you want to do then?"
"204987124-0-61449";"Where do you want me to look?"
"204987124-0-61451";"I'll look for the people you mentioned at the stables."
"204987124-0-61452";"Thulsgreg thinks you're guilty as well. You forced this new method on the clan without listening."
"204987124-0-61456";"Doesn't someone have to be in charge?"
"204987124-0-61457";"You think the chief will follow through with it?"
"204987124-0-61462";"How do we stop the harrowstorm?"
"204987124-0-61464";"I'll get Arkay's sacred oil from the temple stockpile."
"204987124-0-61465";"You never check your cargo?"
"204987124-0-61466";"There's no other way to get in?"
"204987124-0-61468";"You want to abandon Solitude?"
"204987124-0-61475";"All right. Who do I talk to about a job?"
"204987124-0-61476";"Why are you recruiting for your debtors?"
"204987124-0-61477";"Why are you recruiting for your debtors?"
"204987124-0-61479";"Why are you recruiting for your debtors?"
"204987124-0-61480";"Any idea who the benefactor is?"
"204987124-0-61481";"I've never heard of your group before."
"204987124-0-61482";"Could I gather your samples from them?"
"204987124-0-61483";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-61484";"You're certain that this potion will be safe to consume?"
"204987124-0-61485";"They don't do their own research?"
"204987124-0-61486";"What kind of jobs do you offer?"
"204987124-0-61493";"I found urns in crates smuggled into Solitude. They seem to be related to the Icereach Coven."
"204987124-0-61494";"The Icereach Coven is comprised of witches, not vampires."
"204987124-0-61495";"How can a vampire help stop the Icereach Coven?"
"204987124-0-61496";"What's a harrowstorm?"
"204987124-0-61497";"The Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-61498";"What's House Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-61506";"Do you know how to use the relic?"
"204987124-0-61512";"Sorry, I meant…"
"204987124-0-61513";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-61514";"Wait, wait …"
"204987124-0-61518";"Are you all right? Your father's revelation seemed to hit you pretty hard."
"204987124-0-61519";"We can't make more elixir without the sacred oil, right?"
"204987124-0-61520";"Can you tell me more about the Mining Consortium?"
"204987124-0-61521";"So you have it?"
"204987124-0-61523";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-61524";"I'll make my way inside."
"204987124-0-61525";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-61526";"I'll help you look for them."
"204987124-0-61529";"Anything else you can tell me about the Frozen Coast?"
"204987124-0-61530";"She cared about what would happen to the Frostbite if she left."
"204987124-0-61534";"You want to follow those two?"
"204987124-0-61537";"How did you get away?"
"204987124-0-61540";"Stay calm. Wait here a moment while I talk to Lyris."
"204987124-0-61544";"What else can you tell me about Chillwind Depths?"
"204987124-0-61545";"What else can you tell me about Chillwind Depths?"
"204987124-0-61546";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-61547";"A jewel of blue rules the view."
"204987124-0-61548";"Tell me more about the ingredients you need."
"204987124-0-61556";"What are you doing down here, Kireth?"
"204987124-0-61557";"What became of the instruments?"
"204987124-0-61558";"Can you tell me more about this instrument you want me to recover?"
"204987124-0-61559";"What kind of oddities?"
"204987124-0-61561";"The Hagraven mentioned some kind of ritual."
"204987124-0-61562";"We've seen a lot of undead. Are all these witches necromancers?"
"204987124-0-61563";"What exactly is that device?"
"204987124-0-61564";"Right. I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-61567";"Lyris and I know a scholar of sorts who's trying to understand the harrowstorm ritual."
"204987124-0-61569";"I'll read Fennorian's message."
"204987124-0-61570";"Did you go back in time?"
"204987124-0-61572";"Have you seen Kireth?"
"204987124-0-61576";"That sounds like quite the event."
"204987124-0-61577";"What makes you think Old Mjolen can help?"
"204987124-0-61578";"But you got along with your mother?"
"204987124-0-61579";"Do you think you can get Jarl Reddharn to listen to us?"
"204987124-0-61580";"Who is Overseer Thulsgreg?"
"204987124-0-61581";"What can you tell me about Chief Urzikh?"
"204987124-0-61582";"Fair enough. I'll talk to Mazog."
"204987124-0-61583";"Does your clan always adhere to tradition?"
"204987124-0-61584";"So, you think she stole the title from you?"
"204987124-0-61585";"I'll talk to Overseer Thulsgreg."
"204987124-0-61586";"So, joining the Gray Host was just about power?"
"204987124-0-61588";"Is there something you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-61589";"How long does the process take?"
"204987124-0-61591";"Tell me about these monsters—the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-61592";"I saw you arguing with this vampire. He healed you?"
"204987124-0-61593";"Tell me about the attackers. Do you know anything about them?"
"204987124-0-61594";"Can you tell me more about the Pyre Watch?"
"204987124-0-61595";"Can you tell me more about the Pyre Watch?"
"204987124-0-61596";"Other than the assassin was a vampire who wore an eye patch and escaped? No."
"204987124-0-61598";"Fennorian. He said he was going to see a clever woman near Morthal."
"204987124-0-61603";"Good luck, swordthane."
"204987124-0-61606";"If Svargrim is connected to the harrowstorm, maybe he's the key to stopping it."
"204987124-0-61610";"If you need us to …."
"204987124-0-61619";"What was it like being a doll?"
"204987124-0-61620";"Will the high king listen to you?"
"204987124-0-61622";"I'll meet you at the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-61627";"I'll head to the Frozen Coast."
"204987124-0-61628";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-61629";"Have you figured it out yet?"
"204987124-0-61630";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-61631";"I hope you get your answers."
"204987124-0-61632";"What's Claudina's story?"
"204987124-0-61634";"You said it's a burial mound. Who's buried here?"
"204987124-0-61635";"You mentioned the Draugrkin. Who are they, exactly?"
"204987124-0-61636";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-61637";"What ceremony?"
"204987124-0-61639";"Does it actually work?"
"204987124-0-61640";"The Ashen Lord took down Lyris in an instant. Leaving the rest to the werewolf worked in our favor."
"204987124-0-61641";"This Morokei sounds dangerous."
"204987124-0-61642";"That was risky."
"204987124-0-61645";"I'm with you. Let's find the warding flames."
"204987124-0-61646";"Have you found anything?"
"204987124-0-61647";"All right, let's find Morokei's tomb."
"204987124-0-61648";"What needs to be done exactly?"
"204987124-0-61649";"The Overseer wants you to leave."
"204987124-0-61655";"Lyris stayed behind to safeguard Princess Svana. I need your help. The assassin is a vampire."
"204987124-0-61658";"All right."
"204987124-0-61664";"Can you tell me a bit about your grandfather?"
"204987124-0-61665";"Priestesses of Kyne can take the form of animals?"
"204987124-0-61666";"Do you think he could still be alive?"
"204987124-0-61667";"That's an interesting staff. Are you a mage of some kind?"
"204987124-0-61668";"Is Kyne associated with owls?"
"204987124-0-61669";"Have you seen a man with an eye patch come through town?"
"204987124-0-61672";"You were blindfolded?"
"204987124-0-61674";"I'm just looking for a man with an eye patch."
"204987124-0-61676";"All right. I'll meet you in the Dwarven ruin."
"204987124-0-61679";"What do you think is reallly going on here?"
"204987124-0-61691";"More sinister than spirits?"
"204987124-0-61693";"You really think the Reachmen will attack Dragon Bridge?"
"204987124-0-61697";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-61698";"Fair enough. Do you have any guesses about what might lie ahead?"
"204987124-0-61699";"Like the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-61705";"I'll find a way into the office."
"204987124-0-61710";"And Jarl Morryn can help with that?"
"204987124-0-61711";"Why now?"
"204987124-0-61713";"Why are you here with the Jarl of Whiterun?"
"204987124-0-61714";"Why are you here with the Jarl of Whiterun?"
"204987124-0-61715";"Tell me more about your mission."
"204987124-0-61729";"So, his wife causes you trouble too?"
"204987124-0-61730";"What specimens do you need?"
"204987124-0-61731";"I will collect the specimens."
"204987124-0-61732";"Why did Havil call you a clever woman?"
"204987124-0-61742";"Wave the medallion around? If you say so."
"204987124-0-61743";"Any guesses as to what it might be?"
"204987124-0-61746";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-61751";"<Face Trial in Kyne's Aegis.>"
"204987124-0-61760";"I was thinking about our time in the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-61761";"I visited Elsweyr and battled a rage of Dragons … <Tell Kireth about your adventures.>"
"204987124-0-61762";"I was thinking about our time in the Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-61763";"I spent some time in Summerset … <Tell Kireth about your adventures.>"
"204987124-0-61767";"Was the clan struggling before Chief Urzikh took over?"
"204987124-0-61768";"What do you think caused the mine collapse?"
"204987124-0-61769";"What other things?"
"204987124-0-61771";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-61772";"How will I find them?"
"204987124-0-61775";"Tell me about Thane Hraldi and Thane Svyne."
"204987124-0-61777";"Tell me about Thane Hraldi."
"204987124-0-61778";"Tell me about Thane Svyne."
"204987124-0-61779";"Tell me about Thane Hraldi."
"204987124-0-61786";"I'll head to the farm and find out if Havil is safe."
"204987124-0-61791";"You said Freiwen enjoyed visiting the farm?"
"204987124-0-61792";"I'll ask Mjolen if she has a solution to these undead."
"204987124-0-61793";"She told me about a place where she can watch Morthal and be happy."
"204987124-0-61794";"I will ask Old Mjolen if she has a cure."
"204987124-0-61795";"You can't go to her. The curse kills anyone who approaches."
"204987124-0-61796";"How did you learn about this stonemelt solution?"
"204987124-0-61797";"What happens if I make a mistake?"
"204987124-0-61798";"She told me the curse resurrected memories from her life."
"204987124-0-61799";"I will absorb Freiwen's memories into her locket."
"204987124-0-61800";"How do Freiwen's memories relate to her cure?"
"204987124-0-61801";"Is that why you live outside of town?"
"204987124-0-61803";"Did you know Freiwen?"
"204987124-0-61804";"The feast?"
"204987124-0-61805";"Then why not eat something?"
"204987124-0-61818";"Are you staying here?"
"204987124-0-61824";"So, this started as a siege technique?"
"204987124-0-61836";"You mentioned half-kin?"
"204987124-0-61839";"So that's where the ""Aegis"" comes from?"
"204987124-0-61840";"How long has he been at this?"
"204987124-0-61842";"So, has Fennorian changed your view of vampires?"
"204987124-0-61845";"Have you ever seen anything like this before?"
"204987124-0-61847";"So you think Essenia is one of these pureblood vampires?"
"204987124-0-61849";"What do you think Essenia did to these vampires?"
"204987124-0-61850";"<Add Ashpit Powder.>"

"204987124-0-61866";"What kind of mad scheme?"
"204987124-0-61868";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-61869";"<Enter Stone Garden.>"
"204987124-0-61870";"And what about your companion?"
"204987124-0-61872";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-61873";"<Enter Castle Thorn.>"
"204987124-0-61875";"I'll help you stop Arkasis's plans."
"204987124-0-61881";"I'll help you get inside the castle and uncover Lady Thorn's plan."
"204987124-0-61895";"Ironbelly said something about a vampire. He wanted them to turn him."
"204987124-0-61901";"Have you found any other survivors?"
"204987124-0-61902";"What does that medallion do?"
"204987124-0-61903";"They should be arriving shortly."
"204987124-0-61905";"I wish you luck, Jarl Morryn."
"204987124-0-61939";"Could you talk to the high king about this threat? He might listen to you."
"204987124-0-61940";"I heard what your mother told you. She didn't believe that and neither should you."
"204987124-0-61941";"Could you talk to the high king about this threat? He might listen to you."
"204987124-0-61943";"What else can you tell me about the assassin?"
"204987124-0-61944";"Have you had much success down here?"
"204987124-0-61945";"You think the missing miners just wandered off?"
"204987124-0-61946";"Maugh?"
"204987124-0-61948";"All right. I'll try to track down the assassin."
"204987124-0-61949";"Tsaesci?"
"204987124-0-61950";"Are there any clues I should look out for?"
"204987124-0-61952";"You said you were from an organization?"
"204987124-0-61953";"Are you from the future?"
"204987124-0-61955";"Do you feel any different?"
"204987124-0-61957";"I saw you while I was looking for parts. We even spoke."
"204987124-0-61959";"They helped you escape?"
"204987124-0-61960";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-61961";"What's so important about these power nodes?"
"204987124-0-61962";"What's so important about these power nodes?"
"204987124-0-61964";"Have you ever seen anything like the strange pike before?"
"204987124-0-61965";"Does the coven normally work alongside vampires?"
"204987124-0-61966";"Have you ever seen anything like the strange pike before?"
"204987124-0-61967";"Have you ever seen anything like the strange pike before?"
"204987124-0-61971";"Fenn it is. I'll find him and see if he can help us track down Queen Gerhyld's assassin."
"204987124-0-61976";"Has anything like this ever happened before?"
"204987124-0-61977";"Why do you oppose the chief?"
"204987124-0-61978";"Do you do most of your mining nearby?"
"204987124-0-61979";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-61988";"Do you know where your missing miners might have gone?"
"204987124-0-61992";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-61996";"I'll find Lyris and Fenn."
"204987124-0-61997";"Do you think the Reachmen and these strange sticks are connected?"
"204987124-0-62002";"Elle and Overseer Urlvar?"
"204987124-0-62003";"Have you seen any locations where bandits could hide down here?"
"204987124-0-62004";"So you haven't seen or heard about anything suspicious going on down here?"
"204987124-0-62005";"Why would wolves attack farmhands?"
"204987124-0-62006";"You don't believe in the supernatural?"
"204987124-0-62007";"I will investigate farm and find out what happened."
"204987124-0-62009";"So you haven't seen or heard about anything suspicious going on down here?"
"204987124-0-62011";"I'll wait for you to complete the ritual."
"204987124-0-62012";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-62014";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-62015";"And the elixir will protect everyone else?"
"204987124-0-62017";"Do you think she can handle it?"
"204987124-0-62020";"How'd you stop them?"
"204987124-0-62021";"You think the people who responded to the flier we found are in danger?"
"204987124-0-62023";"I'll go with you to the Grinning Horker Inn, Lyris."
"204987124-0-62026";"Are you in charge of the temple?"
"204987124-0-62035";"Why is he here?"
"204987124-0-62036";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-62037";"I'll check the offices."
"204987124-0-62039";"I'll speak with Fenn."
"204987124-0-62041";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-62044";"How quickly can you produce this cure?"
"204987124-0-62046";"Svana needs your elixir now. She asked me to make sure everything is going smoothly."
"204987124-0-62047";"What's the problem?"
"204987124-0-62050";"Did Tzinghalis's notes tell you more about the gray reliquaries and the stone husks?"
"204987124-0-62051";"Why teach them then?"
"204987124-0-62052";"Of course, princess."
"204987124-0-62059";"Fenn also believes he can make a cure for the harrowed."
"204987124-0-62060";"What do you have planned?"
"204987124-0-62066";"Have you experienced any more visions?"
"204987124-0-62083";"What can I expect to find up ahead?"
"204987124-0-62084";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-62085";"Svargrim obviously hates Jorunn, so why is the Skald-King intent on helping him?"
"204987124-0-62086";"How do we know the smugglers and Reachmen are even connected?"
"204987124-0-62090";"Do we have any leads?"
"204987124-0-62091";"Will the people of Western Skyrim accept help from Eastmarch?"
"204987124-0-62092";"Do you think Svana's ready to rule Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62093";"Still, this is far from your holdings."
"204987124-0-62094";"What are you doing here, King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-62095";"Why are you so willing to help people who consider you their enemy?"
"204987124-0-62096";"Do you think there can finally be peace between Eastern and Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62097";"What happened to your pack?"
"204987124-0-62099";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-62102";"Do you think the temple interior wasn't affected by the storm?"
"204987124-0-62110";"Magical traps?"
"204987124-0-62111";"Go on. You have no interest in sharing the glory with who?"
"204987124-0-62112";"So, you can't move because you believe bottles can't move on their own?"
"204987124-0-62115";"There are still others held captive at Greymoor Keep?"
"204987124-0-62116";"Until the caravans started to go missing."
"204987124-0-62117";"Why is Solitude ignoring you?"
"204987124-0-62118";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-62120";"I'll accompany you to see the jarls."
"204987124-0-62122";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-62123";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-62125";"So High King Svargrim has finally decided to take action?"
"204987124-0-62136";"How about you let me have a bottle for free to help save all of Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62138";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-62139";"Why does Dragon Bridge need a garrison?"
"204987124-0-62140";"Tell me about your caravan agent."
"204987124-0-62144";"It sounds like Ena does a lot for the garrison."
"204987124-0-62147";"What's so special about Farethor's meat?"
"204987124-0-62148";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-62151";"Sounds like you like him."
"204987124-0-62152";"Whatever you say. Who is this librarian, exactly?"
"204987124-0-62154";"All right. We'll look for this laboratory."
"204987124-0-62156";"So, does this mean we're partners?"
"204987124-0-62157";"Can you tell me anything else about Vund's reagent?"
"204987124-0-62158";"Tell me more about Vund."
"204987124-0-62159";"You said they threatened Ulang. Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-62162";"I'll go to the barrow and find out what happened to your soldiers."
"204987124-0-62163";"There must be something we can do to convince you."
"204987124-0-62166";"<Lie> I have no idea who you're talking about. I'm studying Maelmoth's works alone."
"204987124-0-62168";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-62169";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-62173";"What do you intend to learn from this text, anyway? Deem-Vilax seemed to think Maelmoth was crazy."
"204987124-0-62174";"So we're headed to Kilkreath Temple. Fair enough."
"204987124-0-62181";"Will you and Rigurt get the Thanes to agree to a treaty?"
"204987124-0-62182";"Are you worried about working with the smuggler again?"
"204987124-0-62185";"What do you think Lord Falgravn was trying to do here?"
"204987124-0-62186";"What can you tell me about the librarian?"
"204987124-0-62188";"So, does this mean we're partners?"
"204987124-0-62190";"What exactly is the Scraps?"
"204987124-0-62191";"What exactly is the Scraps?"
"204987124-0-62192";"Who do you intend to call?"
"204987124-0-62193";"What kind of experiment are you conducting?"
"204987124-0-62194";"What kind of experiment are you conducting?"
"204987124-0-62198";"Tell me about the missing caravans."
"204987124-0-62200";"I'll look for the missing caravan."
"204987124-0-62201";"What was it like being a doll?"
"204987124-0-62202";"Do you think the Dragon Cult is a threat?"
"204987124-0-62203";"What was it like being a doll?"
"204987124-0-62215";"What will these traps do?"
"204987124-0-62216";"How did you convince her to let you be her assistant?"
"204987124-0-62218";"Easy, Svana. This isn't the place to lose your head."
"204987124-0-62220";"It certainly seems possible. We might be able to use that knowledge to protect the kingdom."
"204987124-0-62222";"I'll find Lyris and meet you in the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-62224";"Svana's fine. She wants us to meet her in her chamber in the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-62225";"What have you been up to since we last saw each other?"
"204987124-0-62227";"Why were you in jail?"
"204987124-0-62228";"So he let you keep your title?"
"204987124-0-62229";"The coven isn't acting alone. Someone called the Ashen Lord commands vampires and werewolves."
"204987124-0-62230";"Have you and your father never gotten along?"
"204987124-0-62231";"Why can't King Jorunn just send us to Haafingar. Isn't he the High-King of Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62232";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-62234";"How are you going to seal the temple?"
"204987124-0-62235";"Here's Meridia's relic."
"204987124-0-62236";"Are you really hiding in here?"
"204987124-0-62237";"What can you tell me about the mine?"
"204987124-0-62238";"I guess we'll see. Where would this door be if it existed?"
"204987124-0-62239";"What can you tell me about Arkasis?"
"204987124-0-62241";"Kyne?"
"204987124-0-62242";"And that somewhere is the Stone Garden?"
"204987124-0-62244";"All right, I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-62246";"I'll join you."
"204987124-0-62247";"You could help us with our mission."
"204987124-0-62248";"You should head back to the Lonely Troll now."
"204987124-0-62249";"You could help us with our mission."
"204987124-0-62250";"All right, I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-62255";"Maybe this is how you prove yourself to him."
"204987124-0-62259";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-62260";"All right. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-62264";"Can't we go back the way we came?"
"204987124-0-62267";"Mazog has to be punished."
"204987124-0-62274";"Maelmoth may have conjured door illusions there."
"204987124-0-62275";"All right, I'll meet you at Sabre Cat's Leap."
"204987124-0-62278";"Your brother?"
"204987124-0-62279";"Mazog must be punished."
"204987124-0-62280";"Why do you want me to talk to these people?"
"204987124-0-62281";"It's some sort of monster?"
"204987124-0-62282";"That still doesn't answer my question."
"204987124-0-62283";"Who is this Pale Man?"
"204987124-0-62284";"The healers couldn't help?"
"204987124-0-62287";"Who is this Pale Man?"
"204987124-0-62289";"When did it arrive?"
"204987124-0-62290";"What did this Pale Man look like?"
"204987124-0-62292";"I'll tell Aerolf everything you've told me."
"204987124-0-62293";"Why not give me a clue?"
"204987124-0-62294";"How do you know the Pale Man killed Bear?"
"204987124-0-62296";"What did you do then?"
"204987124-0-62298";"I'll tell Aerolf what you've told me."
"204987124-0-62300";"That's not a clue. You're just repeating what the riddle said."
"204987124-0-62301";"You mean this Dwarven key?"
"204987124-0-62306";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-62308";"Why didn't it attack you?"
"204987124-0-62309";"You want me to act as bait?"
"204987124-0-62311";"I'll help you. What do you need me to get?"
"204987124-0-62312";"But why are you asking me to gather draugr parts instead of just one draugr?"
"204987124-0-62313";"Why send me to Dead Man's Respite? Is there something special about the draugr there?"
"204987124-0-62314";"What type of mixture?"
"204987124-0-62315";"Why do we need to assemble a draugr?"
"204987124-0-62316";"How do you know it will work on the Pale Man?"
"204987124-0-62317";"Why do we need to assemble a draugr?"
"204987124-0-62318";"You mentioned dousing the body with alchemy?"
"204987124-0-62322";"Hopefully the orders we found will give us an advantage."
"204987124-0-62323";"Where should I put it?"
"204987124-0-62324";"What if the Pale Man doesn't come out?"
"204987124-0-62326";"Let's hope it doesn't come to that."
"204987124-0-62327";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-62331";"I found these objects in the lair. Do you recognize them?"
"204987124-0-62332";"What about these other items?"
"204987124-0-62334";"Do you want me bring these items to the families?"
"204987124-0-62335";"It's almost over."
"204987124-0-62337";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-62338";"Curse? What kind of pack are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-62339";"Tell me about Tzinghalis."
"204987124-0-62340";"What other uses?"
"204987124-0-62341";"Maelmoth certainly went to a lot of effort to hide it."
"204987124-0-62343";"So what will you do next?"
"204987124-0-62344";"Pack mates. That's an interesting turn of phrase."
"204987124-0-62346";"And you think you can tell me where to find Fennorian?"
"204987124-0-62348";"I see what you're getting at, but Svana did what we all do. Whatever's necessary."
"204987124-0-62353";"We absolutely do."
"204987124-0-62355";"<Pet Pickle> Good boy."
"204987124-0-62358";"But why seal off this old fortress?"
"204987124-0-62360";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-62361";"<Pet Pickle> Good, lead on."
"204987124-0-62364";"Why did they trap you inside a doll?"
"204987124-0-62367";"Why seal themselves in the Temple of the Divines and the Tower of the Wolf?"
"204987124-0-62370";"Are you sure you're able to conduct this meeting?"
"204987124-0-62371";"The Antiquarian's Eye?"
"204987124-0-62372";"Let's find out. How do I begin?"
"204987124-0-62374";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-62375";"Did you see one of those strange sticks in the barrow?"
"204987124-0-62376";"What were the circumstances?"
"204987124-0-62378";"Why did Havil call you a clever woman?"
"204987124-0-62379";"I do. I want to join the Antiquarian Circle."
"204987124-0-62382";"How does your writing contribute to the Circle?"
"204987124-0-62384";"I'll meet you at the cart."
"204987124-0-62385";"And then there was a war?"
"204987124-0-62386";"Why these particular Dragon Mounds?"
"204987124-0-62387";"What happened to the Dragon Cult?"
"204987124-0-62388";"Is there any danger at these Dragon Mounds?"
"204987124-0-62389";"What can you tell me about the Dragon Cult?"
"204987124-0-62390";"What does it do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-62391";"Are the relics you find valuable?"
"204987124-0-62392";"Did you teach there?"
"204987124-0-62393";"What is the goal of the Antiquarian Circle, exactly?"
"204987124-0-62395";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-62396";"You think the Dragons buried there may wake up?"
"204987124-0-62398";"What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-62399";"Are you sure you need to do this?"
"204987124-0-62400";"Do you really think Dragons could threaten Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62401";"What can you tell me about the Antiquarian's Eye?"
"204987124-0-62402";"It washes off."
"204987124-0-62403";"Follow me and stay close."
"204987124-0-62404";"What can you tell me about the Antiquarian's Eye?"
"204987124-0-62405";"You've read the reports. What did happen in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-62406";"Why didn't you tell me your plan before now?"
"204987124-0-62407";"Why didn't you tell me your plan before now?"
"204987124-0-62408";"I'm not going to let that happen."
"204987124-0-62411";"You think these antiquities can help you find Darien?"
"204987124-0-62412";"Meridia still has a hold on him. He disappeared again."
"204987124-0-62413";"But the Eye can't find people, can it?"
"204987124-0-62414";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-62415";"I'll keep searching too."
"204987124-0-62416";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-62417";"He wanted us to know how much we meant to him. And he hopes we won't forget him."
"204987124-0-62418";"So what do you want to do, princess?"
"204987124-0-62420";"All right. Let's destroy any gray reliquaries we can find."
"204987124-0-62424";"So they sent you to test your theory out here?"
"204987124-0-62425";"Are you going to get in trouble?"
"204987124-0-62427";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-62428";"Did the Circle send you to ward the Dragon Mounds?"
"204987124-0-62430";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-62431";"Do you think you should be in trouble?"
"204987124-0-62433";"Pack mates. That's an interesting turn of phrase."
"204987124-0-62434";"Could you remind me how the Antiquarian's Eye works?"
"204987124-0-62435";"But you don't know for sure."
"204987124-0-62436";"Trust yourself. If you believe in your theory, let others know."
"204987124-0-62437";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-62438";"That seems wise."
"204987124-0-62441";"How can I find something truly magnificent?"
"204987124-0-62442";"What's the greatest thing you've ever recovered?"
"204987124-0-62443";"Who is Lady Thorn?"
"204987124-0-62444";"Where are you headed next?"
"204987124-0-62445";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-62447";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-62448";"How did you know about Dusktown?"
"204987124-0-62449";"They knew you were werewolves, you mean?"
"204987124-0-62450";"What were you supposed to tell Fenn, once your pack was freed?"
"204987124-0-62451";"What were you supposed to tell Fenn, once your pack was freed?"
"204987124-0-62453";"How'd you survive?"
"204987124-0-62455";"Do you have any advice for facing the Sea Giant?"
"204987124-0-62456";"Why were you kicked out of the mines?"
"204987124-0-62457";"What do you think is really going on here?"
"204987124-0-62458";"I was told to feed them these berries, but how will that help?"
"204987124-0-62461";"You're hurt. How can I help you?"
"204987124-0-62462";"I'll help with the ceremony."
"204987124-0-62463";"I'll help you, Hafskjar. Let's free Bjora."
"204987124-0-62464";"Let's get you out of here."
"204987124-0-62467";"Here's your flask. I found it in your lodgings in Dusktown."
"204987124-0-62471";"Do you think Svana's ready to rule Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62472";"Do you think Svana is ready to become the ruler of Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62473";"What are you doing here, King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-62475";"My friend went to find an exit, let's go."
"204987124-0-62477";"Why did you go with Captain Mavvok?"
"204987124-0-62478";"Can you tell me more about the Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-62479";"Could it have been a bear?"
"204987124-0-62480";"Do you have any idea what took your crew members?"
"204987124-0-62481";"What's your business in Solitude?"
"204987124-0-62483";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-62484";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-62493";"Cross the bridge or sneak in through a sluice gate. Sounds like a clear choice."
"204987124-0-62498";"Did Magister Fridelja learn that might help us?"
"204987124-0-62499";"So the high king has finally acknowledged the threat to his kingdom?"
"204987124-0-62500";"You fought Skreg?"
"204987124-0-62502";"You still fought him after all that?"
"204987124-0-62505";"You said you sensed something?"
"204987124-0-62509";"Was the adventure everything you hoped for?"
"204987124-0-62516";"Good luck in your search."
"204987124-0-62518";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-62520";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-62521";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-62526";"Warriors are bad enough, but we need to stop that harrowstorm."
"204987124-0-62532";"Pickle?"
"204987124-0-62534";"I'll find Viggol and keep him safe."
"204987124-0-62539";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-62543";"What do you think is really going on here?"
"204987124-0-62544";"Do you think this amulet really calmed the storm?"
"204987124-0-62546";"What's Dark Moon Grotto?"
"204987124-0-62548";"What else can you tell me about this sickness?"
"204987124-0-62549";"Do you know where he was headed?"
"204987124-0-62552";"Have you seen Skor at all?"
"204987124-0-62553";"Come to Solitude with us. There must be a place there where you can set up your equipment."
"204987124-0-62554";"When did all this start?"
"204987124-0-62558";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-62560";"Did the other refugees lock you out of the grotto?"
"204987124-0-62563";"But you don't think these attacks are like that?"
"204987124-0-62568";"Stories such as?"
"204987124-0-62570";"Who is your husband?"
"204987124-0-62572";"Cross the bridge or sneak in through a sluice gate. Sounds like a clear choice."
"204987124-0-62573";"A man named Brun made it to Morthal."
"204987124-0-62575";"You heard whispers and saw spirits?"
"204987124-0-62576";"How were you cured?"
"204987124-0-62578";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-62580";"It sounds like Svargrim doesn't much care for Jorunn."
"204987124-0-62581";"How do we know the smugglers and Reachmen are even connected?"
"204987124-0-62582";"I thought you died. I saw you sacrifice yourself to the Amulet of Kings."
"204987124-0-62584";"Not like here?"
"204987124-0-62585";"What have you been doing in Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-62586";"Have you discovered anything about the Icereach Coven's allies?"
"204987124-0-62587";"Svargrim seems to think Jorunn plans to conquer his kingdom. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-62589";"What's that about Draugrkin plunder?"
"204987124-0-62591";"Can you tell me anything that'll help me defeat her?"
"204987124-0-62592";"Does Sai Sahan know you're alive?"
"204987124-0-62593";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-62594";"There's something you need to know. Sai Sahan is alive."
"204987124-0-62595";"I thought you died. I saw you sacrifice yourself to the Amulet of Kings."
"204987124-0-62596";"Did you know Brondold well?"
"204987124-0-62598";"Clever woman?"
"204987124-0-62599";"I'll put it to good use."
"204987124-0-62600";"I thought we destroyed the coven when we assaulted Icereach."
"204987124-0-62601";"I saw him. It's him. He doesn't know how he survived, but he's alive."
"204987124-0-62602";"I thought we destroyed the coven when we assaulted Icereach."
"204987124-0-62603";"I thought we destroyed the coven when we assaulted Icereach."
"204987124-0-62604";"Explain what this is all about again."
"204987124-0-62607";"I'll go after Rasir."
"204987124-0-62609";"I was tracking the shipments, too. That's what led me here to warn the priests."
"204987124-0-62611";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-62612";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-62613";"What about the locket?"
"204987124-0-62616";"I will find the tree and help break the curse."
"204987124-0-62618";"All right. I'll bring your people the meat."
"204987124-0-62620";"Anything I can help with?"
"204987124-0-62621";"What are your plans going forward?"
"204987124-0-62622";"What are your plans going forward?"
"204987124-0-62624";"I have another idea. Let's discuss what we found on the headstones."
"204987124-0-62625";"Does that tell you enough to figure out how to create the medallions?"
"204987124-0-62626";"Why does Dragon Bridge need a garrison?"
"204987124-0-62627";"Not really."
"204987124-0-62628";"And what about the heartcog?"
"204987124-0-62629";"Is that what your Dissonance Apparatus is supposed to do?"
"204987124-0-62630";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-62632";"Thanks!"
"204987124-0-62634";"How do you know they're from Blackreach?"
"204987124-0-62636";"How do I make use of this anointed relic?"
"204987124-0-62637";"I can handle that."
"204987124-0-62638";"So I need to have a relic in mind. Then what?"
"204987124-0-62640";"Fair enough. I'll try using the Antiquarian's Eye."
"204987124-0-62641";"All right. How will I know which tool to use?"
"204987124-0-62642";"Patterns?"
"204987124-0-62643";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-62644";"And once I select an antiquity to search for?"
"204987124-0-62645";"Why would it be better off being left alone?"
"204987124-0-62646";"Thanks. Now, can we go over excavation again?"
"204987124-0-62647";"There can be more than one location?"
"204987124-0-62649";"What are you hoping to learn?"
"204987124-0-62650";"Where can I find leads?"
"204987124-0-62652";"I'll head to Midnight Barrow."
"204987124-0-62656";"How should I decide what antiquities to pursue?"
"204987124-0-62657";"What if it doesn't work?"
"204987124-0-62658";"He did, but I wanted to ask you some questions."
"204987124-0-62659";"You'll get your bark."
"204987124-0-62663";"Is that why you want to study their organs?"
"204987124-0-62664";"For what purpose?"
"204987124-0-62665";"Could the scout be mistaken?"
"204987124-0-62666";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"204987124-0-62667";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"204987124-0-62669";"All right. I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-62671";"What do the rumors say?"
"204987124-0-62672";"You think it's all made up?"
"204987124-0-62674";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-62675";"Who is Landal Gevont?"
"204987124-0-62678";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"204987124-0-62680";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"204987124-0-62682";"Tell me about this group you represent."
"204987124-0-62684";"How many of these devices do you have?"
"204987124-0-62685";"Is she dead?"
"204987124-0-62686";"Where did she fall?"
"204987124-0-62687";"What became of Freiwen?"
"204987124-0-62688";"So, you've established a new annex here?"
"204987124-0-62689";"I will look for information at the ruins."
"204987124-0-62690";"I want to know more about Maxten."
"204987124-0-62693";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-62694";"What happens after you get up on the ledge?"
"204987124-0-62696";"If the door closes, how will you escape?"
"204987124-0-62697";"I'll clear a path for you."
"204987124-0-62698";"Should we check on the temple now?"
"204987124-0-62703";"What's the significance of the residue?"
"204987124-0-62705";"Let's go check on the pilgrims."
"204987124-0-62706";"Some of that, yes. Do you know how I can defeat it?"
"204987124-0-62708";"Can you tell me about where you found it?"
"204987124-0-62709";"Any suggestions for dealing with a construct this size?"
"204987124-0-62711";"You mentioned Bjora before. Who is she?"
"204987124-0-62712";"Tell me about the storm you saw."
"204987124-0-62721";"You don't approve?"
"204987124-0-62722";"Why are there still so many harrowstorms occurring?"
"204987124-0-62725";"Why did Maxten curse you like this?"
"204987124-0-62727";"Did you see what attacked him?"
"204987124-0-62728";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-62729";"Could you remind me how the Antiquarian's Eye works?"
"204987124-0-62730";"What can happen if I'm not careful?"
"204987124-0-62731";"This western vampire must be pretty powerful."
"204987124-0-62732";"Where's this Count Verandis you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-62733";"What more can you tell me about this Blood Queen, Lady Essenia?"
"204987124-0-62734";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-62735";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-62739";"All right. See you at the Blue Palace."
"204987124-0-62746";"Why do the people of Skyrim distrust magic?"
"204987124-0-62747";"I'm a vampire, too. Do you want me to stay away?"
"204987124-0-62750";"<Leave the table after realizing you lack the necessary ingredients.>"
"204987124-0-62751";"We can't leave now. We have to get inside the keep."
"204987124-0-62752";"Can you tell us if there's an entrance to the keep, at least?"
"204987124-0-62754";"Show us how to get inside and we'll leave you alone. You have my word."
"204987124-0-62757";"<Combine three parts gloomspore agaric with one part bloodknight organ and consume the results.>"
"204987124-0-62760";"<Combine three parts gloomspore agaric with one part bloodknight brain and consume the results.>"
"204987124-0-62763";"So the spell is broken for good?"
"204987124-0-62767";"It will take me directly to him?"
"204987124-0-62771";"Let's head to the temple now."
"204987124-0-62772";"So what does that tell us?"
"204987124-0-62774";"Are you sure you should be down here, princess?"
"204987124-0-62775";"What do you make of the map?"
"204987124-0-62776";"Can you tell me more about the thanes themselves?"
"204987124-0-62777";"I'll help you resolve the feud between the thanes."
"204987124-0-62778";"Lyris is in Solitude. I thought you tried to avoid large cities?"
"204987124-0-62781";"You said the Kjenstag ruins would overwhelm Maxten. What spirits reside there?"
"204987124-0-62782";"People don't like the chief?"
"204987124-0-62783";"How do the stone husks tie to the harrowstorms?"
"204987124-0-62784";"Brought back to life? Is that even possible?"
"204987124-0-62786";"Where's the rest of your pack?"
"204987124-0-62787";"Edjar is on his way. I'll be back with the rest of your pack."
"204987124-0-62788";"What do you think of Overseer Thulsgreg?"
"204987124-0-62793";"I see."
"204987124-0-62796";"Pigs, and pigs, and pigs, and pigs, My auntie's fingers, thin as twigs!"
"204987124-0-62797";"What is happening?"
"204987124-0-62798";"Vibrant feathers drift on the wind, my hair grew long but never thinned."
"204987124-0-62799";"On the shores of an open sea, hordes of horkers frolic free."
"204987124-0-62800";"Pigs, and pigs, and pigs, and pigs, My auntie's fingers, thin as twigs."
"204987124-0-62801";"Vibrant feathers drift on the wind, my hair grew long but never thinned."
"204987124-0-62802";"On the shores of an open sea, hordes of horkers frolic free."
"204987124-0-62803";"Vibrant feathers drift on the wind, my hair grew long but never thinned."
"204987124-0-62808";"So why are we here?"
"204987124-0-62813";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-62815";"Are you sure this will work?"
"204987124-0-62816";"What will you do about those creatures still stalking the mine?"
"204987124-0-62817";"What will you do about those creatures still stalking the mine?"
"204987124-0-62822";"And then?"
"204987124-0-62824";"And then?"
"204987124-0-62827";"Do you think the ghost hunters Elle hired are helping?"
"204987124-0-62829";"Elle and Overseer Urlvar seem to think the missing people might have wandered off."
"204987124-0-62830";"Fennorian is going to seek help from a clever woman near Morthal."
"204987124-0-62832";"Should we help them with their research?"
"204987124-0-62835";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-62838";"I'll tell Jarl Morryn to expect you and Thane Svyne."
"204987124-0-62839";"Tell me more."
"204987124-0-62841";"Yes, I want to be one of the Undaunted."
"204987124-0-62844";"Will other vampires attack now that you don't have protection?"
"204987124-0-62847";"Did you ever suspect he'd betray you?"
"204987124-0-62850";"What will you and Claudina do next?"
"204987124-0-62851";"Are you happy we caught Overseer Urlvar?"
"204987124-0-62853";"Did you try taking him to a mage?"
"204987124-0-62856";"We heard them mention exarchs and the Ashen Lord. Do you know what any of that means?"
"204987124-0-62857";"I know it was a vampire. He wore an eye patch and dropped this medallion when he fled."
"204987124-0-62859";"Why would Essenia do this to her own kind?"
"204987124-0-62860";"Why would Essenia do this to her own kind?"
"204987124-0-62861";"Can we talk about the situation in Morthal?"
"204987124-0-62863";"I'll find the queen's assassin."
"204987124-0-62866";"If this is just an illusion, why can't you move?"
"204987124-0-62867";"So he kept a lot of secrets?"
"204987124-0-62868";"Tell me about this incantation. Someone hid the verses?"
"204987124-0-62869";"If this is just an illusion, why can't you move?"
"204987124-0-62870";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-62874";"You expected him to die?"
"204987124-0-62882";"That sounds pretty suspicious. Did you steal this scroll?"
"204987124-0-62883";"Who is this Maelmoth, anyway?"
"204987124-0-62884";"What ancient army?"
"204987124-0-62887";"Ghosts and monsters?"
"204987124-0-62889";"She left a letter to her lover. It wasn't you."
"204987124-0-62891";"Here are the samples."
"204987124-0-62893";"I did. Along with a letter to your boss."
"204987124-0-62895";"I can search the tower for Bjora and the others."
"204987124-0-62897";"You can really figure out the ritual by studying the residue?"
"204987124-0-62900";"Why did you leave Svana at the Lonely Troll?"
"204987124-0-62901";"What are you hoping to find back at the ritual site?"
"204987124-0-62903";"Watching your mother die in front of you must have been devastating. Do you need some time?"
"204987124-0-62904";"Watching your mother die in front of you must have been devastating. Do you need some time?"
"204987124-0-62907";"Why did you refer to Svana's father as the old wolf?"
"204987124-0-62908";"Why did you refer to Svana's father as the old wolf?"
"204987124-0-62909";"How did you get free?"
"204987124-0-62910";"If you let me read the journal, I can compensate you for the damage Narsis caused."
"204987124-0-62911";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-62913";"My companion heard that Essenia ceded her castle to a vampire from the west. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-62914";"Did Essenia tell you anything about the tests you're undergoing?"
"204987124-0-62915";"I'll think about it. So, you discovered it all on your own?"
"204987124-0-62917";"Mad? Mad how?"
"204987124-0-62919";"You said Adusa weathered it, though?"
"204987124-0-62920";"My companion heard that Essenia ceded her castle to a vampire from the west. Is that true?"
"204987124-0-62924";"You're sure you can do this?"
"204987124-0-62926";"What ingredients do you need?"
"204987124-0-62928";"Why are there refugees down here?"
"204987124-0-62931";"It's for a special meal, only the best will do."
"204987124-0-62932";"Can I take it with me?"
"204987124-0-62933";"I'll get the kiviaq for you."
"204987124-0-62934";"I asked nicely. I won't do that again."
"204987124-0-62936";"Take your samples."
"204987124-0-62937";"Why do you dislike Chief Urzikh so much?"
"204987124-0-62938";"She didn't like either of you. Take your samples."
"204987124-0-62939";"But has the alchemy helped the clan?"
"204987124-0-62940";"You really seem to dislike Chief Urzikh."
"204987124-0-62941";"Why do you dislike Overseer Thulsgreg so much?"
"204987124-0-62942";"Take the samples."
"204987124-0-62944";"Are you willing to put your feud aside and meet with Thane Hraldi and Jarl Morryn?"
"204987124-0-62945";"Agreed. I'll tell Jarl Morryn to expect you and Thane Hraldi."
"204987124-0-62946";"I will. Thank you."
"204987124-0-62949";"Let's prepare a meal for Thane Svyne."
"204987124-0-62950";"Take the ore. I still have Ghamborz's letter."
"204987124-0-62951";"An elderly mage? Is he looking for Maelmoth's trove, too?"
"204987124-0-62952";"Why didn't you go with him to look for Rasir?"
"204987124-0-62953";"So, you encouraged him to let it go?"
"204987124-0-62955";"Will you credit him in your books if we find Maelmoth's trove?"
"204987124-0-62956";"Did the other refugees lock you out of the grotto?"
"204987124-0-62958";"That you won't see her again — and that you should wash the dishes."
"204987124-0-62960";"Here's the samples and her letter."
"204987124-0-62961";"I'm not ready yet."
"204987124-0-62963";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-62964";"I'll be back."
"204987124-0-62965";"I've changed my mind, let's go."
"204987124-0-62966";"Do you think he was successful?"
"204987124-0-62967";"Let's find that cavern."
"204987124-0-62968";"What kinds of things did they do to him?"
"204987124-0-62972";"I'll find Rasir."
"204987124-0-62973";"What happened to Rasir?"
"204987124-0-62980";"Where is Skor now?"
"204987124-0-62981";"How do you know these people?"
"204987124-0-62982";"What happened back at the cavern?"
"204987124-0-62983";"I'll find the cure."
"204987124-0-62984";"How did you know the people who have the ingredients?"
"204987124-0-62985";"I met Brigvar. You cured him."
"204987124-0-62988";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-62993";"All right, I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-62996";"What else can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-62997";"Should I stuff you in my pack now?"
"204987124-0-63002";"What did you say this place was called?"
"204987124-0-63004";"Is that a good thing?"
"204987124-0-63010";"What of the other afflicted?"
"204987124-0-63013";"You're not originally from Morthal?"
"204987124-0-63015";"Why can't we ask her where they are?"
"204987124-0-63016";"All right, I'll free your pack mates."
"204987124-0-63018";"Transformation? What transformation?"
"204987124-0-63019";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-63020";"Let me help you down. You can tell me more about these bloodknights."
"204987124-0-63023";"I'll find Rasir."
"204987124-0-63024";"Will killing Essenia stop the bloodknights?"
"204987124-0-63025";"Why was Verandis's bloodline so important to this ritual?"
"204987124-0-63027";"Fair enough. Let's get moving."
"204987124-0-63028";"She survived the experience. Just take it day-by-day."
"204987124-0-63031";"I believe it."
"204987124-0-63038";"Will you perform it publicly?"
"204987124-0-63041";"That doesn't make any sense."
"204987124-0-63042";"Something wrong?"
"204987124-0-63044";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-63045";"Why won't the other refugees speak to you?"
"204987124-0-63048";"<Lie> You're right, of course. Go ahead and take the bottle!"
"204987124-0-63051";"All right. The way is clear. You can head for the surface."
"204987124-0-63056";"I found it next to a dead Nord woman."
"204987124-0-63057";"At least you know what happened to your goods now."
"204987124-0-63058";"At least you know what happened to your goods now."
"204987124-0-63059";"At least you know what happened to your goods now."
"204987124-0-63064";"What will you do then?"
"204987124-0-63065";"So, you really have a problem with alchemical mining?"
"204987124-0-63066";"He had many fooled."
"204987124-0-63069";"Do you think Rasir is still alive?"
"204987124-0-63070";"How did they change the recipe?"
"204987124-0-63072";"All right. The way is clear. You should make for the exit."
"204987124-0-63073";"A chaurus?"
"204987124-0-63074";"How does my thirst influence the gifts you've given me?"
"204987124-0-63076";"I'll help you gather the ingredients you need to save your sister."
"204987124-0-63077";"The way out is clear. You can escape now."
"204987124-0-63079";"Can I take it with me?"
"204987124-0-63082";"Can I take it with me?"
"204987124-0-63084";"The Divines personally blessed the wall?"
"204987124-0-63087";"Tell me more about your two options."
"204987124-0-63088";"What did she do then?"
"204987124-0-63089";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-63097";"This is a long way from Rivenspire, though."
"204987124-0-63098";"What are you hoping to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-63099";"Where's Verandis?"
"204987124-0-63100";"What more can you tell me about this Blood Queen, Lady Essenia?"
"204987124-0-63101";"What more can you tell me about this Blood Queen, Lady Essenia?"
"204987124-0-63102";"So you're also a vampire?"
"204987124-0-63103";"Has Count Verandis returned to Castle Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-63105";"What's your relationship to Fennorian?"
"204987124-0-63106";"What's your relationship to Fennorian?"
"204987124-0-63107";"Were you able to accomplish anything while we were rescuing Fenn?"
"204987124-0-63109";"How so?"
"204987124-0-63110";"So, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-63112";"Why do you think this is where they're making their medallions?"
"204987124-0-63113";"What do we know about the midlands camp?"
"204987124-0-63114";"What do we know about the midlands camp?"
"204987124-0-63115";"You came to Kilkreath by yourself?"
"204987124-0-63116";"The survivors said the storm changed the pilgrims and priests into mindless husks or feral monsters."
"204987124-0-63117";"I'll see you at Kilkreath Temple after you warn the high king."
"204987124-0-63119";"Why would someone assassinate you?"
"204987124-0-63121";"Cursed?"
"204987124-0-63122";"What's the confusion?"
"204987124-0-63124";"You're saying that not everyone needs to be married?"
"204987124-0-63125";"I'll handle it, Gwendis. You have my word."
"204987124-0-63127";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-63133";"All I have is my word."
"204987124-0-63134";"I was abducted by the coven, but I escaped after learning their plans."
"204987124-0-63136";"We'll find that proof, your majesty."
"204987124-0-63137";"Why did Jorunn send you to help Svargrim? They obviously have a bad history."
"204987124-0-63138";"I guess we should check out the lodge."
"204987124-0-63140";"I'll see you at the lodge."
"204987124-0-63143";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-63145";"Remind me why an agent of a Rivenspire noble house is operating in Skyrim."
"204987124-0-63150";"You mentioned a curse on the local wolves?"
"204987124-0-63151";"What do you mean, Solitude is ignoring you?"
"204987124-0-63152";"Sounds like the garrison is in trouble."
"204987124-0-63153";"You mentioned that Solitude is ignoring you."
"204987124-0-63154";"Where did she come from?"
"204987124-0-63155";"What was she doing in the woods?"
"204987124-0-63156";"Do you know why Maxten brought Freiwen to Kjenstag ruins?"
"204987124-0-63157";"I saw a ghost of Freiwen at Havil's farm."
"204987124-0-63158";"Why would she curse a place she enjoyed?"
"204987124-0-63159";"I want to know more about Maxten."
"204987124-0-63160";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-63161";"You were working with the Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-63163";"Maestros?"
"204987124-0-63165";"<Untie Ulang.>"
"204987124-0-63167";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-63168";"Then who did?"
"204987124-0-63169";"I'll keep her safe."
"204987124-0-63170";"I'll stop this necromancer."
"204987124-0-63176";"I'll leave you to it."
"204987124-0-63178";"I hope that works, for your sake."
"204987124-0-63180";"She's proven capable so far."
"204987124-0-63184";"Why were the urns here?"
"204987124-0-63185";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-63187";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63188";"Can I use all the gifts you've given me right away?"
"204987124-0-63189";"So, I will become stronger by feeding?"
"204987124-0-63190";"How does my thirst influence the gifts you've given me?"
"204987124-0-63191";"Once I grow in power, how many powers will I wield?"
"204987124-0-63192";"Do I simply bite them?"
"204987124-0-63193";"Can I use all the gifts you've given me right away?"
"204987124-0-63194";"So some sort of conference?"
"204987124-0-63197";"Fascinating."
"204987124-0-63201";"Follow your lead with what?"
"204987124-0-63202";"And what was the purpose of the stone husks?"
"204987124-0-63203";"Very well."
"204987124-0-63204";"Let's change the subject. Tell me about your grandfather."
"204987124-0-63205";"Will you take over as High Queen?"
"204987124-0-63207";"Let me know if you do."
"204987124-0-63210";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-63211";"What exactly happened at Kilkreath Temple?"
"204987124-0-63212";"You came to Kilkreath by yourself?"
"204987124-0-63213";"You came to Kilkreath by yourself?"
"204987124-0-63215";"Do you mind if I ask why it has wheels on it?"
"204987124-0-63216";"Is that why you left Summerset?"
"204987124-0-63217";"That's pretty ingenious."
"204987124-0-63218";"So you joined the Circle to explore the world?"
"204987124-0-63219";"Why do you call yourself an eccentric?"
"204987124-0-63220";"Can you give me an example?"
"204987124-0-63221";"And the other members of the Circle see these mysteries as …?"
"204987124-0-63222";"What brings you to the Gwylim Annex here in Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63223";"Do you have anything to show for your efforts?"
"204987124-0-63224";"Oh?"
"204987124-0-63225";"Why do you call yourself an eccentric?"
"204987124-0-63226";"I guess I'll take your word for it."
"204987124-0-63227";"How will I know Nelfthea when I see her?"
"204987124-0-63228";"Why would you want her to get beaten and exiled as well?"
"204987124-0-63229";"How will I know Nelfthea when I see her?"
"204987124-0-63241";"Tomb-studies?"
"204987124-0-63243";"So you focus on dungeons, then?"
"204987124-0-63244";"So, you're a warrior?"
"204987124-0-63245";"Rewards like gold?"
"204987124-0-63247";"What were your plans?"
"204987124-0-63248";"What's House Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-63249";"You're not originally from Morthal?"
"204987124-0-63250";"Should we take a closer look at the temple now?"
"204987124-0-63252";"What is the Midnight Barrow?"
"204987124-0-63253";"Why was that woman giving orders to the Jarl's thane?"
"204987124-0-63254";"What was that woman trying to convince your ancestor to do?"
"204987124-0-63255";"Why was that woman giving orders to the Jarl's thane?"
"204987124-0-63256";"What was that woman trying to convince your ancestor to do?"
"204987124-0-63257";"What was that woman trying to convince your ancestor to do?"
"204987124-0-63260";"You don't believe in the supernatural?"
"204987124-0-63261";"You don't believe in the supernatural?"
"204987124-0-63262";"And you never found out what happened to her?"
"204987124-0-63263";"Do you think someone is trying to bring the Gray Host back to life?"
"204987124-0-63264";"Tell me more about Mjolen."
"204987124-0-63265";"You said Freiwen enjoyed visiting the farm?"
"204987124-0-63266";"Tell me about the Coterie of Organized Scholars."
"204987124-0-63267";"Can you tell me anything else about dealing with these werewolves and goats?"
"204987124-0-63268";"Is that why you're recruiting?"
"204987124-0-63269";"How is that going?"
"204987124-0-63271";"All right. I'll try to get Maelmoth's journal from this librarian."
"204987124-0-63272";"All right. I'll try to get Maelmoth's journal from this librarian."
"204987124-0-63274";"You don't approve?"
"204987124-0-63275";"And if it doesn't?"
"204987124-0-63276";"Can you use the rune magic to end the curse?"
"204987124-0-63277";"I'll be wary."
"204987124-0-63278";"I saw a ghost of Freiwen at Havil's farm."
"204987124-0-63279";"So, that's what froze the soldiers."
"204987124-0-63280";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-63281";"I'll bring you the organs to find out."
"204987124-0-63284";"So …?"
"204987124-0-63285";"So you left?"
"204987124-0-63286";"So you still contribute to the stronghold somehow?"
"204987124-0-63287";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-63288";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63289";"What drove you to a life of scholarship?"
"204987124-0-63290";"What drove you to a life of scholarship?"
"204987124-0-63291";"So what do we do if High King Svargrim refuses to see us?"
"204987124-0-63292";"Why do you think the Icereach Coven wants to turn people into harrowfiends?"
"204987124-0-63293";"Thanks for the tip. Now, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-63294";"You said I'm saving the Bards College?"
"204987124-0-63295";"You spend a lot of time together?"
"204987124-0-63296";"She takes some reckless positions in her work?"
"204987124-0-63297";"How did you get into the antiquity hunting business, anyway?"
"204987124-0-63298";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63299";"Frivolous fantasies like being a banker?"
"204987124-0-63301";"We need to free Edjar's pack mates from Exarch Tzinghalis in the Lightless Hollow."
"204987124-0-63303";"Why hire us to make this discovery?"
"204987124-0-63305";"I'll use the key we found to free the pack. Meet me in the Lightless Hollow, south of the work camp."
"204987124-0-63306";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-63307";"That sounds a little dull."
"204987124-0-63308";"Have you found anything really interesting here?"
"204987124-0-63309";"Who are you, again?"
"204987124-0-63310";"What college do you refer to?"
"204987124-0-63311";"Where are the instruments now?"
"204987124-0-63312";"I can retrieve the instrument for you."
"204987124-0-63314";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-63316";"What are you doing in Blackreach?"
"204987124-0-63317";"What do you think is happening here?"
"204987124-0-63318";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-63319";"Why would these Giants join forces with a vampire?"
"204987124-0-63320";"So, Lord Falgravn offered them a chance at plunder, and they took it?"
"204987124-0-63321";"Tell me more about Kyne's Aegis."
"204987124-0-63322";"I saw a memory where you called Maxten your love."
"204987124-0-63323";"So she never actually kidnapped you?"
"204987124-0-63325";"Why did Maxten inflict this curse on you?"
"204987124-0-63327";"What does he want with Kyne's Aegis?"
"204987124-0-63328";"Any idea what that might be?"
"204987124-0-63329";"Tell me about these Sea Giants."
"204987124-0-63330";"Are there any survivors left out there?"
"204987124-0-63331";"What else do you know about Lord Falgravn?"
"204987124-0-63332";"I'll make sure Skreg gets what he deserves."
"204987124-0-63333";"Do you think you can hold the village?"
"204987124-0-63334";"Did the vampires or Giants take an interest in the Span?"
"204987124-0-63335";"So how did you get free?"
"204987124-0-63336";"You're going to lose a lot of your mine that way."
"204987124-0-63337";"Any other plans?"
"204987124-0-63338";"I don't know. What do you say to that?"
"204987124-0-63339";"I'll put it to good use."
"204987124-0-63340";"Tell me about the storm you experienced."
"204987124-0-63341";"Are you in charge of the temple?"
"204987124-0-63342";"What sounds?"
"204987124-0-63346";"You have no information about her motivations?"
"204987124-0-63347";"I'll find your colossus and keep it from growing any larger."
"204987124-0-63348";"There's no information about her at all?"
"204987124-0-63349";"So she never actually kidnapped you?"
"204987124-0-63350";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-63351";"Why are there still so many harrowstorms occurring?"
"204987124-0-63355";"Remarkable? You sound like you respect them."
"204987124-0-63359";"Thank you. Now, what kinds of object will I find out there?"
"204987124-0-63360";"What about my ""true form?"" The Blood Scion?"
"204987124-0-63361";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-63362";"Did you speak to your father?"
"204987124-0-63366";"Do you think she'll be fine here?"
"204987124-0-63367";"Fair enough. I'm helping him to dispel the illusion."
"204987124-0-63370";"How have the people of Morthal accepted her return?"
"204987124-0-63374";"Where do you go from here?"
"204987124-0-63378";"All right. I'll find Mugha and ask him what happened."
"204987124-0-63386";"But they are right this time."
"204987124-0-63392";"It sounded like Lady Thorn wanted him to bring you here."
"204987124-0-63393";"So, Talfyg lied the whole time?"
"204987124-0-63394";"What are you looking for here?"
"204987124-0-63397";"What do you think House Ravenwatch will do with the information?"
"204987124-0-63398";"What was Lady Thorn's plan for building an army?"
"204987124-0-63400";"What did you mean about the deadly vampiric threat?"
"204987124-0-63401";"You keep saying ""we."" Who are you referring to?"
"204987124-0-63404";"The Lost Valley?"
"204987124-0-63405";"And none of your people refused to lay down and die for you?"
"204987124-0-63407";"What do we know so far?"
"204987124-0-63410";"I'll help you find out more about the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63411";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-63413";"I'll help you find out more about the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63414";"Constructs and shadowy creatures?"
"204987124-0-63415";"It suggests that Lady Belain wants to awaken some sort of dark relic."
"204987124-0-63416";"The note says the pentarch was pulled through the portals by one of these shards."
"204987124-0-63417";"Remind me about the Direnni Elf."
"204987124-0-63418";"Tell me about the Gray Host survivor."
"204987124-0-63419";"What do you think they want with this dark energy?"
"204987124-0-63420";"Tell me about the experiments with life energy."
"204987124-0-63421";"What are the rest of the Ravenwatch doing?"
"204987124-0-63422";"Is this related to what we learned in Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63423";"How many of you are there?"
"204987124-0-63424";"Tell me more about what you learned."
"204987124-0-63425";"The note suggests that the void crystals can be rotated to focus the energy."
"204987124-0-63426";"What do you mean, outlandish?"
"204987124-0-63427";"Is this related to what we learned in Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63428";"So you want more reasonable answers."
"204987124-0-63430";"Should we go after Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain?"
"204987124-0-63431";"Septima Tharn's army attacked Bangkorai Garrison? Where are they now?"
"204987124-0-63434";"Regardless, I need to ask you some questions about the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63435";"Now that things have settled down, can I ask you some questions about the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-63437";"Pyre Watch?"
"204987124-0-63438";"Have you ever heard of the Pyre Watch?"
"204987124-0-63441";"I'll meet you back here with the scholars."
"204987124-0-63442";"I'll find the Pyre Watch warrior and your colleagues."
"204987124-0-63445";"No. Scholar Diel said she was with you and Indouz."
"204987124-0-63447";"I'll find them. Get to Scholar Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63449";"I'll check the Crypt of the Exiles. Get to Scholar Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63450";"I haven't. Scholar Diel said she was leading you toward Evermore."
"204987124-0-63453";"I'll find them. Go to Scholar Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63454";"I'll go to the Crypt of the Exiles. Get to Scholar Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63455";"I located Scholars Cogline and Indouz. I sent them to Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63458";"So there's nothing you can tell me about how the Gray Host was defeated?"
"204987124-0-63459";"There must be something you know that can help us understand the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63461";"I need to tell my associate Gwendis about this. You should return to Scholar Diel's camp."
"204987124-0-63462";"Tell me more about that part of the record."
"204987124-0-63464";"She confirmed there was a survivor. And they may have taken sanctuary in Viridian Watch."
"204987124-0-63465";"Apparently the legend says the way to safety was only available to those worthy to receive it."
"204987124-0-63467";"I'll meet you inside Viridian Watch."
"204987124-0-63468";"She believes Nathari's ritual will awaken the Dark Heart."
"204987124-0-63469";"You had some sort of falling out?"
"204987124-0-63471";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-63472";"There has to be an explanation."
"204987124-0-63474";"Let's head to the castle now. <Fast Travel>"
"204987124-0-63475";"Can't you just ask Count Verandis where he got the signet?"
"204987124-0-63476";"So what do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-63478";"Let's investigate the castle cellar."
"204987124-0-63479";"But Verandis is gone. Why sneak in the back?"
"204987124-0-63481";"Let's investigate the castle cellar."
"204987124-0-63482";"Verandis gave his life to save Rivenspire. Does it matter what he did thousands of years ago?"
"204987124-0-63485";"What do you mean, ""oh no""?"
"204987124-0-63487";"It mentions void portals, strange energy pockets that can be harnessed to travel short distances."
"204987124-0-63488";"It mentions an island and a Gray Host castle. There's a map, too."
"204987124-0-63489";"I'll go with you to investigate the Gray Host castle."
"204987124-0-63491";"I'll meet you by the cart."
"204987124-0-63494";"I want to know more about the kind of work they need accomplished."
"204987124-0-63495";"You're working with the Reachfolk?"
"204987124-0-63496";"Like the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-63497";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-63498";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-63499";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-63501";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-63502";"Is that why you're enlisting help?"
"204987124-0-63503";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-63504";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-63505";"What about the ritual has to do with Namira?"
"204987124-0-63506";"Then why are you recruiting?"
"204987124-0-63507";"What could be worse than all those deaths?"
"204987124-0-63509";"I'll help you. Do you know where we should start looking for Rada al-Saran?"
"204987124-0-63510";"How has Markarth fared since the Gray Host's attack?"
"204987124-0-63513";"Tell me more about the Antiquarian's Circle."
"204987124-0-63514";"What do you hope to find at the orrery?"
"204987124-0-63516";"Tell me more about the Antiquarian's Circle."
"204987124-0-63517";"I see. Do you need a hand?"
"204987124-0-63518";"What were you in prison for?"
"204987124-0-63520";"What's it like protecting these two?"
"204987124-0-63521";"Is there anything else?"
"204987124-0-63522";"So you're Fighters Guild, eh? Me, too."
"204987124-0-63523";"Are they that easy to work with?"
"204987124-0-63524";"Did Verandis mention what he wants to discuss with me?"
"204987124-0-63525";"Did you learn anything while stalking them?"
"204987124-0-63528";"It's a lead, at least."
"204987124-0-63529";"What about Fenn's elixir? Was he able to produce enough for the holds?"
"204987124-0-63530";"What's Fenn examining over there?"
"204987124-0-63531";"How's Svana?"
"204987124-0-63532";"What else have you learned while you were tracking the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-63535";"Were you able to decipher the coded message?"
"204987124-0-63536";"Have you learned anything about their current plans?"
"204987124-0-63537";"Were you two close?"
"204987124-0-63538";"Is he taunting us?"
"204987124-0-63539";"What do you know about Nighthollow Keep?"
"204987124-0-63540";"But you sense some sort of danger beyond that door?"
"204987124-0-63542";"All right, I'll help you search Nighthollow Keep."
"204987124-0-63543";"Can we use that to stop it?"
"204987124-0-63547";"This darkness. Is it what Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain seek?"
"204987124-0-63548";"You think that's what's happening?"
"204987124-0-63549";"Tell me about the Ard's Stonehands."
"204987124-0-63551";"Why is it important to the Wildblood clan to get the talismans back?"
"204987124-0-63552";"So their families want the talismans returned?"
"204987124-0-63554";"So we relieve one of the patrols of their keys?"
"204987124-0-63555";"All right, let's find a way into the keep."
"204987124-0-63558";"And you're sure we'll find it here?"
"204987124-0-63559";"What kind of traps?"
"204987124-0-63561";"Let's go look around the island."
"204987124-0-63562";"Do you know what that insignia is?"
"204987124-0-63564";"I'll watch and see what your magic reveals."
"204987124-0-63566";"Beneath stars and spheres? Where can I find Lady Belain?"
"204987124-0-63567";"So what do we do with these crystals?"
"204987124-0-63568";"I'll try to deactivate the crystals."
"204987124-0-63571";"What do you make of the memory we saw?"
"204987124-0-63573";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-63579";"Why are the vampires here so different? They're more like crazed monsters than intelligent beings."
"204987124-0-63581";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-63582";"What's your idea?"
"204987124-0-63583";"I've used the void portals before. I'll find my way to the chamber."
"204987124-0-63586";"Then let's find a path to that chamber."
"204987124-0-63587";"I thought Exarch Tzinghalis corrupted Verandis's research, but the memory tells a different tale."
"204987124-0-63589";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63593";"How is Verandis's blood going to help us?"
"204987124-0-63594";"Is a dream-walk dangerous?"
"204987124-0-63596";"I'll drink the dream-walk potion and find out what I can."
"204987124-0-63597";"I'll drink the dream-walk potion and find out what I can."
"204987124-0-63598";"Tell me more about these harrowstorms."
"204987124-0-63599";"How do I disrupt a harrowstorm?"
"204987124-0-63600";"I know how to disrupt a harrowstorm ritual."
"204987124-0-63603";"What does Mannimarco have to do with all this?"
"204987124-0-63604";"I'll present myself to Ard Caddach."
"204987124-0-63606";"What should I do now?"
"204987124-0-63607";"Verandis was part of the Gray Host in the ancient past, but he cut ties with them long ago."
"204987124-0-63608";"You were mortal once."
"204987124-0-63612";"All I suggest is that we live in peace with mortals. They outnumber us, after all."
"204987124-0-63614";"I won't stop trying to convince you that my course is the correct one."
"204987124-0-63615";"One failure was more than enough. Even power such as you describe is not worth the cost."
"204987124-0-63616";"We are not their gods, Tzinghalis. We are their equals."
"204987124-0-63618";"I hope you do succeed, Tzinghalis."
"204987124-0-63619";"Mortals are not as you remember them. Empress Hestra would make a fine ally."
"204987124-0-63620";"You can't continue to war against the mortals. There are simply too many of them."
"204987124-0-63622";"I believe in the Gray Council, not Styriche's Gray Host. And an alliance would protect us all."
"204987124-0-63623";"He was. And something called the Gray Council. But he wanted them to make peace with mortals."
"204987124-0-63624";"No. He argued for an alliance with mortals. He truly wanted peace."
"204987124-0-63626";"I can lead you to the study."
"204987124-0-63627";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-63628";"You want to pull a member of the Gray Council out of Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-63629";"You want to pull a member of the Gray Council out of Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-63631";"I'll go get the reliquary."
"204987124-0-63632";"I'll go get the reliquary."
"204987124-0-63633";"I'll watch while you perform your magic."
"204987124-0-63635";"Maybe the Dark Halls lead to the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-63636";"I'll look for an entrance to the Dark Halls."
"204987124-0-63637";"This is the Nighthollow Testament. It's not written in a language I can read."
"204987124-0-63638";"We found this unassembled keystone in the Bthar-Zel ruins."
"204987124-0-63639";"How does any of this help us stop the Darkstorm?"
"204987124-0-63641";"Is it safe to leave the orrery unprotected while we search for the laboratory?"
"204987124-0-63643";"But we have to stop Rada al-Saran, right?"
"204987124-0-63644";"The shadow beings you mentioned. Do you think they're Dwarves?"
"204987124-0-63646";"I dream-walked through your memories. I saw what you said to him and the others."
"204987124-0-63647";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-63649";"I'll be ready when you call."
"204987124-0-63650";"I dream-walked through your memories. I saw what you said to him and the others."
"204987124-0-63652";"I'll be ready when you send word."
"204987124-0-63653";"Gwendis and I discovered that Rada al-Saran is still alive. The Gray Host has returned."
"204987124-0-63654";"So you're going to work with him on this?"
"204987124-0-63656";"Anything else I can help with at the moment?"
"204987124-0-63657";"A greater sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-63659";"Lady Belain said she was ready to awaken the Heart centuries ago. Why wait until now?"
"204987124-0-63660";"Any idea what this place might have been?"
"204987124-0-63662";"Tell me more about Lost Valley."
"204987124-0-63663";"What kind of revelation?"
"204987124-0-63665";"Dark worship?"
"204987124-0-63666";"Tell me more about Lost Valley."
"204987124-0-63667";"You're a historian. You must know something that could help me."
"204987124-0-63668";"You must know something else about the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63670";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-63672";"All right, what do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-63673";"What risk?"
"204987124-0-63675";"Tell me more about what I need to do."
"204987124-0-63679";"All right, I'll keep looking."
"204987124-0-63684";"What are you doing out here, anyway?"
"204987124-0-63689";"They're called harrowfiends. I think the storm that hit Karthwasten was a harrowstorm."
"204987124-0-63690";"How do we restore the wards?"
"204987124-0-63691";"Ard Caddach called all the clans to take shelter in the city."
"204987124-0-63693";"I'll meet you outside."
"204987124-0-63694";"I'll see you at Ravenwatch Castle."
"204987124-0-63696";"What do we know about this secret island?"
"204987124-0-63697";"What do we know about this secret island?"
"204987124-0-63698";"You know that is not my way, Ulfra."
"204987124-0-63699";"That sounds fascinating. What kind of relic?"
"204987124-0-63701";"We're immortal. We have all the time in the world to catch up."
"204987124-0-63702";"They don't understand the dream, Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-63703";"The dream didn't start with us ruling over mortals."
"204987124-0-63707";"What could Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain want with something like that?"
"204987124-0-63713";"Something unfortunate?"
"204987124-0-63714";"What leads are you looking into?"
"204987124-0-63715";"I spotted Kathad. He's looking for Freyleth."
"204987124-0-63716";"What do you mean, beneath the city?"
"204987124-0-63718";"I'll go to Understone Keep."
"204987124-0-63719";"No. You need to defend yourselves and keep your people safe. The fewer Reachfolk die, the better."
"204987124-0-63721";"I'll find Arana and we'll deal with Lady Belain."
"204987124-0-63722";"Tell me more about Freyleth."
"204987124-0-63723";"You make it sound like no one else has used this place in a long time."
"204987124-0-63724";"Tell me more about your sister."
"204987124-0-63726";"What do you think the Spirit Queen is saying to Nathari?"
"204987124-0-63727";"They have spies in the city, urging your people to flee to the eastern foothills."
"204987124-0-63731";"Verandis said we might not come back from this."
"204987124-0-63733";"Agreed."
"204987124-0-63739";"Why did you ever agree to work with Lady Belain?"
"204987124-0-63740";"Why did you ever agree to work with Lady Belain?"
"204987124-0-63741";"We discovered that Lady Belain is an ancient vampire from the Nighthollow clan."
"204987124-0-63742";"I'll do all I can."
"204987124-0-63744";"Until then, Gwendis."
"204987124-0-63746";"Rada al-Saran will answer for all he's done soon enough."
"204987124-0-63748";"I'll do my best."
"204987124-0-63750";"Why the sudden urgency?"
"204987124-0-63752";"What are you talking about, Kathad?"
"204987124-0-63753";"So what do you want to do about it?"
"204987124-0-63758";"I'm sorry, Gwendis."
"204987124-0-63760";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-63762";"I get it. Boss Trenlor is evil."
"204987124-0-63763";"Who?"
"204987124-0-63764";"Verandis brought you back to life?"
"204987124-0-63766";"You're saying others came with you?"
"204987124-0-63767";"Tell me more about darkcap mushrooms and the Blinds."
"204987124-0-63768";"So how do you plan to save the clan from this powerful, deranged vampire?"
"204987124-0-63769";"About the last time we saw each other …."
"204987124-0-63770";"Where are you headed?"
"204987124-0-63771";"Any sign of Verandis or Rada al-Saran?"
"204987124-0-63772";"Where are we?"
"204987124-0-63773";"What should we do if we don't find Verandis?"
"204987124-0-63775";"Verandis went to confront Rada al-Saran at the orrery."
"204987124-0-63776";"What makes you think heading toward the Darkstorm is our best course?"
"204987124-0-63779";"I'll find the keystone and get into the orrery chamber."
"204987124-0-63781";"There's a standard way to do the briarheart ritual?"
"204987124-0-63783";"And destroying their ritual tools will really stop that?"
"204987124-0-63784";"How does the orrery work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-63788";"Arana was wounded in the battle, but she heard Lady Belain say she was returning to the orrery."
"204987124-0-63790";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-63791";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63792";"You think Rada al-Saran is still here?"
"204987124-0-63793";"There's no other way?"
"204987124-0-63794";"I understand."
"204987124-0-63798";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-63799";"For what reason?"
"204987124-0-63800";"What do you mean, astray?"
"204987124-0-63804";"If it's still in her possession, I'll bring it back."
"204987124-0-63806";"So Ard Caddach wants you to find her?"
"204987124-0-63808";"I'll find Arana."
"204987124-0-63809";"All right, I'll speak to the shaman."
"204987124-0-63811";"The Spirit Queen will just let you die?"
"204987124-0-63812";"I'll go help Verandis."
"204987124-0-63814";"Arana said Namira suppressed her wounds so she could defeat Belain. After the battle, she died."
"204987124-0-63816";"But what about Rada al-Saran and the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-63818";"Why did you trick me into murdering Boss Trenlor?"
"204987124-0-63820";"What about Kathad? Will you try to stop him from joining the Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-63821";"Arana died helping me defeat Lady Belain."
"204987124-0-63828";"Verandis stayed behind to save your people."
"204987124-0-63829";"Verandis had to stay behind to return the souls of your people."
"204987124-0-63830";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-63831";"What sort of agreement have you reached with the Nords?"
"204987124-0-63832";"So what do the mushrooms have to do with it?"
"204987124-0-63835";"Should I take any precautions with the mushrooms, then?"
"204987124-0-63836";"Tell me your thoughts on the other rulers here."
"204987124-0-63837";"What do you think of Skald-King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-63838";"What do you think about Jarl Svana?"
"204987124-0-63839";"What do you think of Skald-King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-63840";"What do you think of Skald-King Jorunn?"
"204987124-0-63841";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-63842";"How are things in Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63844";"You brought Maugh to the palace?"
"204987124-0-63845";"Sword-saint?"
"204987124-0-63848";"There may still be remnants that pose a threat."
"204987124-0-63849";"Lady Belain only seemed interested in destroying Markarth and restoring the Nighthollow clan."
"204987124-0-63851";"What happens to the witch-rebels now?"
"204987124-0-63852";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-63854";"So you've formed an alliance?"
"204987124-0-63855";"Will your father allow another ruler to control the West?"
"204987124-0-63857";"So Ard Caddach will be the king of the Reach?"
"204987124-0-63858";"Is the growth dangerous?"
"204987124-0-63860";"Was that how you made it back?"
"204987124-0-63861";"How so?"
"204987124-0-63863";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-63866";"He did."
"204987124-0-63868";"You'll all do fine, I'm sure."
"204987124-0-63869";"I can."
"204987124-0-63870";"Oh?"
"204987124-0-63872";"Let me know if the Ravenwatch needs my assistance again."
"204987124-0-63874";"I'm honored."
"204987124-0-63877";"I'm honored."
"204987124-0-63878";"The shamans don't want to try to study the strange egg?"
"204987124-0-63881";"In other words, you kill them, whether they agree to die or not."
"204987124-0-63882";"Lady Belain is using you. She doesn't care about your clan."
"204987124-0-63883";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-63884";"The note mentions the Dark Descent, a pit where the rest of the clan is going to be sacrificed."
"204987124-0-63885";"Not exactly, but they have spies in the city, urging people to flee to the hills."
"204987124-0-63887";"I'll present my findings and try to convince Ard Caddach to meet with you."
"204987124-0-63892";"Will you two be traveling together?"
"204987124-0-63894";"I'll go see about this announcement they are making."
"204987124-0-63895";"You sacrificed yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings. You should be dead!"
"204987124-0-63896";"Safe travels then."
"204987124-0-63897";"I'm hunting the Gray Host, too. I need to talk to your leader, Arana."
"204987124-0-63899";"All right. I'll investigate the Gray Host stockpiles."
"204987124-0-63900";"Will you join Arana and help us defeat Lady Belain and the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-63904";"Aren't you worried about trouble with Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-63905";"If <<1>> is so skittish, won't she run when she sees me?"
"204987124-0-63906";"The witch-rebels are hunting the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-63908";"Any idea where the rebels came from?"
"204987124-0-63910";"Freyleth?"
"204987124-0-63911";"I think it may be magical."
"204987124-0-63916";"Why would they want that to happen?"
"204987124-0-63917";"Thanks. I may know where to find the keystone, too. I'll go to Rebel's Retreat and tell Verandis."
"204987124-0-63918";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-63920";"I'll present myself at the ritual pyre."
"204987124-0-63924";"And she and Kathad are lovers?"
"204987124-0-63925";"What's House Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-63926";"I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-63928";"Lady Belain sent me to find you. But according to this letter, she's working with the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-63930";"All right. I'll find out what Lady Belain and the Gray Host are up to."
"204987124-0-63931";"Do you know where Bthar-Zel is located?"
"204987124-0-63932";"Yes. The Ravenwatch and I are ready."
"204987124-0-63937";"What do we know about the Nighthollow vampires?"
"204987124-0-63938";"You allowed a part of your land to be offered to Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-63940";"Do you know know why Mannimarco made this offering?"
"204987124-0-63942";"Where can I find the land you gave to Mannimarco?"
"204987124-0-63943";"Do you regret the deal you made?"
"204987124-0-63944";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-63945";"Let's go find Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-63947";"Does Verandis think the Void energy is dangerous?"
"204987124-0-63949";"What do we know about the Nighthollow vampires?"
"204987124-0-63950";"There are ancient vampire kingdoms under the Reach?"
"204987124-0-63951";"The next step?"
"204987124-0-63953";"Seems like you've been busy since I saw you last."
"204987124-0-63954";"I entered Verandis's memories back in Rivenspire to help him remember something. This seems easier."
"204987124-0-63955";"You seem anxious to see Verandis."
"204987124-0-63957";"How do you know Adusa-daro?"
"204987124-0-63958";"What will you and Gwendis do while we're looking for the keystone?"
"204987124-0-63959";"And that means …?"
"204987124-0-63960";"The Guardian Constellations. Got it."
"204987124-0-63961";"I understand. Let's get moving."
"204987124-0-63962";"So Talfyg approached you due to House Ravenwatch's reputation?"
"204987124-0-63964";"Isn't the Dark Heart evil?"
"204987124-0-63967";"Could this Darkstorm be related to the harrowstorms of Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63968";"Could this Darkstorm be related to the harrowstorms of Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-63969";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-63970";"I'll present myself at the ritual pyre."
"204987124-0-63971";"Is that what brought you to the Reach in the first place?"
"204987124-0-63972";"Would you really intervene against your old friend?"
"204987124-0-63975";"I spoke with Ulfra and Tzinghalis."
"204987124-0-63976";"How did you get involved with the Lothid clan?"
"204987124-0-63977";"His true colors?"
"204987124-0-63979";"Do you think the Lothid clan will accept Freyleth as their leader?"
"204987124-0-63980";"Do you still think the spirits sent me to help you?"
"204987124-0-63981";"Do you know anything about the co-conspirators Arkasis is working with?"
"204987124-0-63984";"So Karthwasten is safe now?"
"204987124-0-63986";"You came back here for Freyleth. Why leave now?"
"204987124-0-63988";"I would like to continue our discussion of an alliance with the mortals later, my friend."
"204987124-0-63989";"I would like to continue our discussion of an alliance with the mortals later, my friend."
"204987124-0-63991";"And I can find a darkcap mushroom in the Blinds?"
"204987124-0-63992";"How do you know Adusa-daro?"
"204987124-0-63993";"You said you'd tell me about you and Adusa after you fed."
"204987124-0-63995";"And what about Kathad and Adusa?"
"204987124-0-63997";"We're going to stop you."
"204987124-0-63998";"Sundered land. Does that sound like the Planemeld to you?"
"204987124-0-64000";"I don't have to tell you anything."
"204987124-0-64002";"Secrets about the Dark Heart and the Void?"
"204987124-0-64003";"Why would Rada al-Saran jeopardize his plan just to prove something to you?"
"204987124-0-64004";"Any idea what the Gray Host's plans for Stone Garden are?"
"204987124-0-64008";"They'd gather energy from harrowstorms into these and use them to hatch Gray Host from stone husks."
"204987124-0-64011";"Perhaps. She sent me to spy on Belain and I wound up talking to the Gray Host leader, Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-64013";"All right, I'll talk to Ard Caddach."
"204987124-0-64015";"You say he escaped from here?"
"204987124-0-64016";"Then why follow him?"
"204987124-0-64017";"Who's Mannimarco?"
"204987124-0-64019";"Why don't you and your sister talk any more?"
"204987124-0-64021";"Fennorian's fine, as far as I know."
"204987124-0-64022";"Keep at it. I'll continue looking for Arkasis."
"204987124-0-64025";"What have you learned?"
"204987124-0-64027";"How did Lady Belain learn about the prophecy?"
"204987124-0-64028";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-64030";"What's our next step?"
"204987124-0-64032";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-64035";"What will happen to Stone Garden?"
"204987124-0-64036";"I should stay here and help you stop Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-64037";"Why would Rada al-Saran allow Lady Belain to lead his army?"
"204987124-0-64038";"I'll find your missing scholars and the Pyre Watch warrior."
"204987124-0-64039";"I'll find your missing scholars and the Pyre Watch warrior."
"204987124-0-64040";"I only feed on the willing. You should consider that."
"204987124-0-64042";"Perhaps another time."
"204987124-0-64043";"You may find that power, bereft of companionship, does not bring satisfaction."
"204987124-0-64045";"Indeed. A pleasure to have met you, Kovan."
"204987124-0-64046";"If we continue to take from mortals without giving back, peace will not last."
"204987124-0-64048";"Perhaps we'll speak later, Sanctus."
"204987124-0-64049";"What need have we for assassins? Death only invites more death."
"204987124-0-64051";"Regretfully, I must decline. Perhaps we can speak later."
"204987124-0-64052";"It would be unwise to reveal your true nature, Vem."
"204987124-0-64054";"I suppose we'll see soon enough. Be well, Vem."
"204987124-0-64055";"There are dungeons beneath the castle?"
"204987124-0-64057";"We'll speak more of this later."
"204987124-0-64058";"Scholar Diel sent me to find you and the scholars. She has a camp outside the garrison's walls."
"204987124-0-64059";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-64060";"What are we trying to achieve by doing this?"
"204987124-0-64061";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-64063";"I'll get to the orrery as fast as I can."
"204987124-0-64064";"Your wife gave me a whistle to call your bunny. <<1>> led me right to you."
"204987124-0-64066";"So Talfyg approached you due to House Ravenwatch's reputation?"
"204987124-0-64067";"Do you have any clue why Lady Thorn wants to build an army?"
"204987124-0-64069";"You were part of the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-64070";"Did it work?"
"204987124-0-64071";"What kind of experiments?"
"204987124-0-64072";"Why do you need to take Gwendis into a side door?"
"204987124-0-64073";"What kind of creature? Did it do anything else?"
"204987124-0-64074";"Gwendis told me you broke free from this castle."
"204987124-0-64075";"Tell me more about what you learned."
"204987124-0-64077";"Can you find your way back to Hiretta now?"
"204987124-0-64078";"The shade made it sound as though the Dark Heart is alive."
"204987124-0-64088";"Do you think it drew Rada al-Saran?"
"204987124-0-64090";"Are you on your own out here?"
"204987124-0-64091";"Any idea what the Gray Host's plans for Stone Garden are?"
"204987124-0-64092";"Any idea what the Gray Host's plans for Stone Garden are?"
"204987124-0-64093";"So the Draugrkin plundered the Unhallowed Grave for Arkasis?"
"204987124-0-64094";"Basement prisons like the ones we saw in Greymoor Keep?"
"204987124-0-64098";"So, what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-64101";"What does it all mean?"
"204987124-0-64102";"Where will you be?"
"204987124-0-64104";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-64109";"But the Reachfolk are barbarians, aren't they?"
"204987124-0-64111";"Why do you care about this Gray Host and the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64115";"Yes, I understand. I'll place the components in the fire now."
"204987124-0-64116";"Where can I find Ulfra and Tzinghalis?"
"204987124-0-64118";"Please take care with my apothecary chest. Many of the components are irreplaceable."
"204987124-0-64120";"I'll begin my search now. Good hunting."
"204987124-0-64121";"The Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-64123";"All right, I'll make my way there now."
"204987124-0-64124";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64125";"I'm a vampire, too."
"204987124-0-64126";"I don't have a problem working with a vampire."
"204987124-0-64127";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64131";"Is any of that true?"
"204987124-0-64133";"You said the Darkstorm is your creation?"
"204987124-0-64135";"I'll try to open a breach into the Void."
"204987124-0-64136";"They're not?"
"204987124-0-64137";"Do you know anything about Ard Caddach that's true?"
"204987124-0-64138";"The Ghostsong clan? That's an unusual name."
"204987124-0-64139";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64141";"Arana tells me you two used to be good friends."
"204987124-0-64143";"An ancient darkness? You mean the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-64146";"Is that why you're no longer part of the clan?"
"204987124-0-64147";"How do you know that Bradan killed that scout?"
"204987124-0-64150";"Witch-rebels?"
"204987124-0-64152";"Tell me more about auramancy."
"204987124-0-64154";"Tell me more about auramancy."
"204987124-0-64155";"Couldn't they just go back to feeding on blood like other vampires?"
"204987124-0-64157";"Let's move forward."
"204987124-0-64158";"What can you tell me about Arkasis?"
"204987124-0-64159";"What can you tell me about Arkasis?"
"204987124-0-64160";"What can you tell me about Arkasis?"
"204987124-0-64161";"Who were the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-64163";"Who's Fennorian?"
"204987124-0-64164";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-64166";"Did you know what they had planned?"
"204987124-0-64169";"That sounds simple enough."
"204987124-0-64171";"Tell me more about this Void energy."
"204987124-0-64174";"What's the purpose of the wards?"
"204987124-0-64175";"You said it grows under Karthwasten?"
"204987124-0-64177";"Karthwasten has a mine?"
"204987124-0-64178";"Karthwasten has a mine?"
"204987124-0-64182";"What did they keep here?"
"204987124-0-64184";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-64185";"<Enter Black Drake Villa.>"
"204987124-0-64186";"And the lockbox is in this mine?"
"204987124-0-64188";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-64189";"<Enter The Cauldron.>"
"204987124-0-64191";"I'll join your search for this book."
"204987124-0-64197";"I'll join your search for the lockbox and Drathas' family."
"204987124-0-64216";"You really want to work with someone called the Despot of Markarth?"
"204987124-0-64218";"I'll see what I can learn about the rebels and their rebellion."
"204987124-0-64219";"Good luck with that."
"204987124-0-64221";"I think the leader of the witch-rebels is named Arana."
"204987124-0-64223";"All right, I'll speak to Lady Belain."
"204987124-0-64226";"How did you wind up at Ard Caddach's side?"
"204987124-0-64228";"What's the rebellion all about?"
"204987124-0-64229";"A bridge?"
"204987124-0-64230";"I've heard him called both ard and the Despot of Markarth."
"204987124-0-64231";"You look as out of place in this court as I do."
"204987124-0-64233";"Why isn't he just called the king of the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64235";"Why is his return to his old clan a problem?"
"204987124-0-64237";"I'll help you save Kathad."
"204987124-0-64238";"If they're just a nuisance, why do you want me to find Arana?"
"204987124-0-64240";"You look as out of place in this court as I do."
"204987124-0-64241";"I thought Ard Caddach said he made peace with the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-64243";"You weren't able to restore them?"
"204987124-0-64244";"What do we know about this secret island?"
"204987124-0-64245";"You really think Count Verandis was part of an army of vampires and werewolves?"
"204987124-0-64246";"Tell me more about the storm."
"204987124-0-64247";"The storms aren't natural. Icereach witches summon the storms at the behest of the Gray Host."
"204987124-0-64248";"Tell me more about the wards that protect your village."
"204987124-0-64259";"Remind me about this connection to the Dark Heart."
"204987124-0-64260";"Apparently, she's meeting with the leader of the Gray Host in Valthume Barrow."
"204987124-0-64261";"What dream is that?"
"204987124-0-64262";"He rules Markarth. Shouldn't he be crowned the Reach's king?"
"204987124-0-64266";"Why would Talfyg seek you out? Who are you?"
"204987124-0-64267";"You're leaving?"
"204987124-0-64269";"Are you really a witch?"
"204987124-0-64270";"I'm <<1>>."
"204987124-0-64274";"The blood of the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64275";"Are you really a witch?"
"204987124-0-64280";"Not one quite like you."
"204987124-0-64282";"Thanks for the warning, Arana."
"204987124-0-64284";"Does your power come from Daedra?"
"204987124-0-64285";"But you do worship the Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-64287";"Your rebellion. Do you intend to overthrow Markarth?"
"204987124-0-64300";"With your wards restored, will your village recover?"
"204987124-0-64308";"Let me know when you have something to go on."
"204987124-0-64311";"And will you?"
"204987124-0-64313";"And what of the Ghostsong clan? Will you return home?"
"204987124-0-64315";"What happens after I burn the message?"
"204987124-0-64316";"I'll find it."
"204987124-0-64317";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-64318";"You seem anxious to see Verandis."
"204987124-0-64319";"Seems like you've been busy since I saw you last."
"204987124-0-64320";"You seem to admire Verandis a lot."
"204987124-0-64321";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-64322";"So Lyris and her companion killed all the vampires?"
"204987124-0-64324";"All right, I'll see if I can find Lyris at Valthume."
"204987124-0-64325";"Seems like you've been busy since I saw you last."
"204987124-0-64326";"Do you know what they were looking for?"
"204987124-0-64327";"What kind of questions?"
"204987124-0-64329";"I'll look for Lyris at Hroldan Ring."
"204987124-0-64330";"We? Is this the handsome Redguard with the impressive beard people have been talking about?"
"204987124-0-64331";"What's so important about these letters?"
"204987124-0-64333";"Who's Sai Sahan?"
"204987124-0-64334";"Lyris mentioned this had a connection to your martial traditions, but she wouldn't explain further."
"204987124-0-64335";"So, what do Rada al-Saran and a Reach hero have to do with Redguard traditions?"
"204987124-0-64336";"Why do you want to conquer the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64337";"Perfection is impossible to attain."
"204987124-0-64339";"Do you think Red Eagle was a Redguard swordmaster, too?"
"204987124-0-64341";"Tell me more about vateshrans."
"204987124-0-64343";"Arana sensed something down here. She called it a darkness."
"204987124-0-64344";"Remind me about the Gray Host survivor."
"204987124-0-64345";"Remind me about the Direnni Elf."
"204987124-0-64346";"Remind me about the Direnni Elf."
"204987124-0-64347";"Remind me about the experiments with life energy."
"204987124-0-64348";"How did you become the shaman's apprentice?"
"204987124-0-64349";"Tell me about the Gray Host survivor."
"204987124-0-64350";"You're a Yokudan."
"204987124-0-64351";"Someone who is perfect can."
"204987124-0-64352";"What do you hope to accomplish at the Bangkorai Garrison?"
"204987124-0-64353";"Is anyone else investigating this?"
"204987124-0-64354";"Who were you arguing with just now?"
"204987124-0-64355";"A great victory."
"204987124-0-64356";"Ask your question."
"204987124-0-64357";"What do you have planned for the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64358";"What do you have planned for the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64359";"Yes."
"204987124-0-64361";"Killing people just to use something is insane."
"204987124-0-64362";"Yes."
"204987124-0-64363";"Where did you come from?"
"204987124-0-64364";"Where did you come from?"
"204987124-0-64365";"I don't take kindly to threats."
"204987124-0-64366";"If I fall, others will stop you."
"204987124-0-64368";"What do you have planned for the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64369";"What do you have planned for the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64370";"Yes."
"204987124-0-64373";"I'll meet you back here with the scholars."
"204987124-0-64375";"So to restore the wards, we're doing some kind of magic ritual?"
"204987124-0-64376";"The spirits help you because you bribe them?"
"204987124-0-64377";"Follow me."
"204987124-0-64378";"We learned something similar. A Direnni noble offered the survivor sanctuary."
"204987124-0-64379";"What's the purpose of the wards?"
"204987124-0-64380";"What's the purpose of the wards?"
"204987124-0-64381";"What kind of arrangement are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-64386";"Tell me more about the spirits your clan reveres."
"204987124-0-64388";"Will he try to stop us from restoring the wards?"
"204987124-0-64389";"So what does a shaman's apprentice do exactly?"
"204987124-0-64391";"Because war is never the answer, Styriche. We can all live in peace. Why can't you see that?"
"204987124-0-64394";"Does beneath stars and spheres mean anything to you?"
"204987124-0-64395";"Where is he telling you to go?"
"204987124-0-64397";"So Talfyg approached you due to House Ravenwatch's reputation?"
"204987124-0-64398";"Why would Talfyg seek you out? Who are you?"
"204987124-0-64401";"Maybe we should go and take a look."
"204987124-0-64402";"Do you think Markarth can keep you safe?"
"204987124-0-64403";"Who's traveling with you?"
"204987124-0-64404";"Who travels with you now?"
"204987124-0-64405";"Who's traveling with you?"
"204987124-0-64406";"What dark things did you speak of?"
"204987124-0-64409";"I killed the leader of the Gray Host and helped return the souls of Markarth to life."
"204987124-0-64411";"Fine. I'll pay for a performance."
"204987124-0-64412";"Let's hear a tale of gods and sorrow."
"204987124-0-64413";"Let's hear a tale of gods and sorrow."
"204987124-0-64414";"Let's hear a tale of gods and sorrow."
"204987124-0-64418";"Have you ever heard of the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"204987124-0-64419";"And you really think you'll find enough silver to arm your warriors?"
"204987124-0-64420";"You think Bthar-Zel contains a vault, even though you've never been there?"
"204987124-0-64423";"You're a member of Verandis's Ravenwatch, I take it?"
"204987124-0-64424";"Tell me more about Rebel's Retreat."
"204987124-0-64425";"You can't give me any additional information?"
"204987124-0-64426";"Where can I find these ritual components?"
"204987124-0-64427";"You're performing a ritual to a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-64428";"Aren't you the leader?"
"204987124-0-64432";"Tell me more about the Witch in the Stars."
"204987124-0-64433";"Why do you call the Warrior the Headsman?"
"204987124-0-64434";"Why do you call the Warrior the Headsman?"
"204987124-0-64435";"You think we're in the wrong place?"
"204987124-0-64436";"Why do you think the Gray Host needs the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"204987124-0-64437";"You think we're in the wrong place?"
"204987124-0-64438";"Is the feeling of darkness worse down here?"
"204987124-0-64439";"Did you get any impressions from the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"204987124-0-64441";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-64442";"Do you worry about encountering the Gray Host out here?"
"204987124-0-64444";"Keep trying. You may not like what you do now, but everyone starts somewhere."
"204987124-0-64450";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-64451";"Who is it?"
"204987124-0-64452";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-64453";"Don't mention it."
"204987124-0-64455";"I think you're being hard on yourself."
"204987124-0-64456";"What's your mission this time?"
"204987124-0-64459";"That's good to hear."
"204987124-0-64461";"Not every mission ends up a success. The Ravenwatch should understand that."
"204987124-0-64462";"Do you know what your next mission will be?"
"204987124-0-64464";"Have you told them how you feel directly?"
"204987124-0-64465";"When will you see them next?"
"204987124-0-64466";"Should we try to use the keystone I acquired?"
"204987124-0-64468";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-64469";"Keep trying. You may not like what you do now, but everyone starts somewhere."
"204987124-0-64471";"I think you're being hard on yourself."
"204987124-0-64472";"Have you told them how you feel directly?"
"204987124-0-64473";"Who is this vateshran?"
"204987124-0-64474";"Not every mission ends up a success. The Ravenwatch should understand that."
"204987124-0-64475";"Tell me more about the Vateshran's Rites."
"204987124-0-64476";"Tell me more about the Vateshran's Rites."
"204987124-0-64477";"Is that the reason for the messages?"
"204987124-0-64478";"I want to hear about my future prosperity."
"204987124-0-64480";"What's tonal energy?"
"204987124-0-64481";"What about these black infections?"
"204987124-0-64482";"What will happen to the Rites?"
"204987124-0-64484";"Where's the relic now?"
"204987124-0-64485";"How many Old Life shrines are there?"
"204987124-0-64486";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-64490";"Why do you haunt Vateshran Hollows?"
"204987124-0-64491";"Tell me about the blue portal."
"204987124-0-64496";"Very well, tell me my fortune."
"204987124-0-64497";"You're resting in the middle of the wilderness?"
"204987124-0-64499";"How long do you plan on staying out here?"
"204987124-0-64500";"I see."
"204987124-0-64501";"Some might."
"204987124-0-64503";"What happens if someone else tries to take Karthwasten for themselves?"
"204987124-0-64504";"Why would they revere Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-64507";"How does the crossbow work?"
"204987124-0-64508";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-64509";"So you let it live?"
"204987124-0-64510";"How do I continue on?"
"204987124-0-64515";"Getting acquainted? They're getting married and they don't know each other?"
"204987124-0-64516";"An emergency?"
"204987124-0-64517";"I can do that. [Take Old Life Messages]"
"204987124-0-64522";"What's a handfasting, exactly?"
"204987124-0-64523";"What's a handfasting?"
"204987124-0-64524";"So you want me to convince her to bring her people into the city?"
"204987124-0-64525";"Why don't you think the Gray Host will attack Markarth?"
"204987124-0-64527";"Then help us fight them."
"204987124-0-64528";"Tell me about your daughter."
"204987124-0-64529";"Why don't you and Chief Six-Ford get along?"
"204987124-0-64532";"Why are you and Arana at odds?"
"204987124-0-64534";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-64535";"Meaning?"
"204987124-0-64536";"Why are you so hostile toward the Six-Ford clan?"
"204987124-0-64538";"Tell me about your son."
"204987124-0-64539";"You murdered your entire clan?"
"204987124-0-64540";"Why are you and Arana at odds?"
"204987124-0-64541";"Is that when they gave you the title, Despot of Markarth?"
"204987124-0-64544";"Are you opposed to this marriage?"
"204987124-0-64549";"All right. Will this cover the cost of the map?"
"204987124-0-64550";"Is getting a response rare?"
"204987124-0-64552";"It's addressed to you. It says ""We're sorry. We can't go through with this."""
"204987124-0-64553";"I'll find Eslyn and Madearn."
"204987124-0-64554";"Why is this handfasting so important to you?"
"204987124-0-64557";"You're a member of Verandis's Ravenwatch, I take it?"
"204987124-0-64558";"And you spoke to Arana?"
"204987124-0-64559";"Tell me more about Rebel's Retreat."
"204987124-0-64562";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-64563";"Tell me more about this vateshran."
"204987124-0-64564";"Does the chief-of-chiefs know about your promise to Drisene?"
"204987124-0-64567";"I see."
"204987124-0-64568";"What do you think about Eslyn?"
"204987124-0-64569";"You don't want to go through with the handfasting?"
"204987124-0-64570";"What about the feud between the Six-Ford and Eagleseers?"
"204987124-0-64573";"I see."
"204987124-0-64574";"What else can you tell me about this vateshran we're looking for?"
"204987124-0-64575";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-64576";"And if I don't win the favor of the spirits?"
"204987124-0-64578";"Can you contact the other Psijics?"
"204987124-0-64582";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-64583";"Have you ever tried to recover one?"
"204987124-0-64584";"Tell me about the Ard's Stonehands."
"204987124-0-64586";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-64590";"Where's the Gray Host now?"
"204987124-0-64591";"Then Markarth is safe. For now."
"204987124-0-64592";"And he placed it all here?"
"204987124-0-64593";"What was in it?"
"204987124-0-64598";"How do you know all this?"
"204987124-0-64601";"Lyris Titanborn and Sai Sahan need to hear this story. It may have significance for them."
"204987124-0-64602";"How did Red Eagle help Rada al-Saran recover his Spirit Sword?"
"204987124-0-64604";"We'll investigate this cave."
"204987124-0-64605";"I'm ready for anything."
"204987124-0-64607";"What is this land sundered from Tamriel that you want Lyris and I to find?"
"204987124-0-64608";"What does he mean to study the Void through Nighthollow eyes?"
"204987124-0-64609";"So I should go with Gwendis to the Nighthollow Archive?"
"204987124-0-64610";"What does he mean to study the Void through Nighthollow eyes?"
"204987124-0-64611";"What's in it for me?"
"204987124-0-64614";"Yeah, I'm in."
"204987124-0-64615";"I know what to do."
"204987124-0-64619";"Do you have any idea where we can learn more about this connection to Red Eagle?"
"204987124-0-64621";"I'll take this journey in your place."
"204987124-0-64625";"I'll find the cave and meet you there."
"204987124-0-64631";"And what about Sai?"
"204987124-0-64633";"Where can I get a briarheart seed?"
"204987124-0-64634";"What about the bright river-shale?"
"204987124-0-64635";"Tell me more about the Hunter."
"204987124-0-64636";"And where in the world do I find a Hagraven's eye?"
"204987124-0-64638";"Where can I find these ritual components?"
"204987124-0-64639";"Where can I find these ritual components?"
"204987124-0-64640";"Where can I find these ritual components?"
"204987124-0-64641";"Not at all. I overcame Hircine in the March of Sacrifices."
"204987124-0-64642";"What will they do when this is all over?"
"204987124-0-64643";"Tell me more about the Hunter."
"204987124-0-64644";"Is your clan here with you?"
"204987124-0-64645";"Tell me about Adusa-daro."
"204987124-0-64646";"I understand. Let me to escort you back to Markarth."
"204987124-0-64647";"I'll find the shrine and participate in the ceremony again."
"204987124-0-64649";"This could be a trap."
"204987124-0-64650";"What is this land sundered from Tamriel that you want Lyris and I to find?"
"204987124-0-64651";"This could be a trap."
"204987124-0-64653";"Where do I find the tree?"
"204987124-0-64657";"What can you tell me about the Lothid clan?"
"204987124-0-64658";"Why should I help you rescue a vampire?"
"204987124-0-64659";"Why do you care what happens to this Kathad?"
"204987124-0-64662";"Why are you not with the others?"
"204987124-0-64664";"What should I do next?"
"204987124-0-64665";"I'm helping two clan members try to end it, so they won't have to get married."
"204987124-0-64666";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-64668";"I'll meet you at your camp."
"204987124-0-64671";"What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-64672";"Eslyn, Madearn, does this give you an idea of how to resolve the feud?"
"204987124-0-64673";"What does this have to do with the Eagleseers and Six-Fords?"
"204987124-0-64675";"How do you know Adusa-daro?"
"204987124-0-64676";"Are you sure that the fragments are still at those battlefields?"
"204987124-0-64677";"What can you tell me about the Battle of Karthspire Lea?"
"204987124-0-64678";"Do you know anything that might help me find the Coil fragement?"
"204987124-0-64679";"How do you know where to find the fragments of the Lover's Coil?"
"204987124-0-64680";"You like Madearn, don't you?"
"204987124-0-64682";"You like her, don't you?"
"204987124-0-64685";"You're that worried about her?"
"204987124-0-64688";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-64690";"Tell me more about darkcap mushrooms and the Blinds."
"204987124-0-64691";"Madearn asked me to come. He tried to find you first, but went to Karthspire Lea by accident."
"204987124-0-64692";"I thought you didn't want to be married off."
"204987124-0-64693";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-64694";"You seem happy that Madearn's here."
"204987124-0-64696";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-64697";"Are you sure the fragment is at the Giant's camp?"
"204987124-0-64700";"Sky tales?"
"204987124-0-64702";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-64704";"Why do you want to come with me?"
"204987124-0-64705";"Why did Boss Trenlor throw you down here?"
"204987124-0-64706";"But they proved there was no need for the feud in the first place."
"204987124-0-64707";"There's more I need to discuss before I make a decision."
"204987124-0-64710";"Madearn can't marry Eslyn. He's already secretly promised to wed Drisene."
"204987124-0-64711";"There's more I need to talk about before I choose."
"204987124-0-64712";"Do you really think Eslyn and Madearn's wedding is the only way to end the feud?"
"204987124-0-64713";"He said it was out of obligation to her brother, who he gave his word to."
"204987124-0-64714";"Madearn can't marry Eslyn. He's already secretly promised to wed Drisene."
"204987124-0-64716";"What will the mushroom do to Boss Trenlor?"
"204987124-0-64722";"Then you're ready to finish this?"
"204987124-0-64723";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-64724";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-64726";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-64727";"Do you think this will work?"
"204987124-0-64728";"Do you think this will work?"
"204987124-0-64731";"She deserves better than a marriage of obligation, Madearn."
"204987124-0-64736";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-64740";"Madearn told me he'd give up his vow to marry Drisene."
"204987124-0-64742";"Tell me more about the Witch in the Stars."
"204987124-0-64743";"You mentioned picking up a book back there?"
"204987124-0-64748";"Keeping your vow to Drisene was right."
"204987124-0-64753";"So you left the Ghostsong clan?"
"204987124-0-64754";"Why don't you and your sister talk any more?"
"204987124-0-64755";"The Spirit Queen?"
"204987124-0-64756";"Where will you meet Farrul Lupus?"
"204987124-0-64757";"Who do you think the True-Sworn work for?"
"204987124-0-64759";"What about Master Pythis?"
"204987124-0-64762";"Will the cave go back to normal now?"
"204987124-0-64766";"Someone here might offer their blood as thanks."
"204987124-0-64767";"What do you think of Gwendis and Fennorian."
"204987124-0-64770";"You should know Master Pythis was behind all of this."
"204987124-0-64773";"Are you sure?"
"204987124-0-64775";"Are you ready to face Rada al-Saran?"
"204987124-0-64776";"I'll give him your reply."
"204987124-0-64778";"All right, where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-64780";"I heard there's no such thing as damnation, only people who have lost hope."
"204987124-0-64782";"What do you mean it was once your home?"
"204987124-0-64784";"Do you miss your home?"
"204987124-0-64785";"Interesting, thank you for telling me."
"204987124-0-64786";"Without Verandis, what will happen to the Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-64787";"Do you regret fighting the Reachfolk?"
"204987124-0-64788";"I didn't imagine you as the type to take a vacation."
"204987124-0-64789";"What about Ard Caddach?"
"204987124-0-64790";"It was."
"204987124-0-64791";"Tell me more about the wards that protect your village."
"204987124-0-64794";"A new purpose?"
"204987124-0-64797";"And they still seek to celebrate Old Life?"
"204987124-0-64799";"I see."
"204987124-0-64800";"Why did the Thornroot clan turn on you?"
"204987124-0-64801";"I understand."
"204987124-0-64805";"Hagravens and Briarhearts?"
"204987124-0-64806";"Is that why your clan came here?"
"204987124-0-64807";"Changed by dark magic? What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-64808";"Hagravens and Briarhearts?"
"204987124-0-64809";"Tell me about your clan."
"204987124-0-64811";"I found this simple totem of claws and fangs."
"204987124-0-64812";"What are the Symbols of the Five Aspects?"
"204987124-0-64814";"Here. Place the relic in this shrine."
"204987124-0-64815";"What is it? It looks like just a bone to me."
"204987124-0-64817";"Here. Place the relic in this shrine."
"204987124-0-64819";"So, both Kitza-Enoo and Apprentice Egvarn died for nothing?"
"204987124-0-64821";"Here. Take it. Place the relic in this shrine."
"204987124-0-64822";"Can you give me any details?"
"204987124-0-64823";"The Gray Host uses netherroot to power their harrowstorms."
"204987124-0-64825";"How did you learn about this old story?"
"204987124-0-64826";"I don't understand how a Reach hero could teach a Redguard swordmaster anything."
"204987124-0-64827";"Will Lyris find us at Red Eagle Redoubt?"
"204987124-0-64828";"I don't understand how a Reach hero could teach a Redguard swordmaster anything."
"204987124-0-64829";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-64830";"I am. Tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-64834";"All right. Stay close."
"204987124-0-64836";"This was before you were part of Arana's band?"
"204987124-0-64844";"What can you tell me about the briarheart ritual?"
"204987124-0-64845";"Why did you lead the Hillhunter clan here?"
"204987124-0-64846";"If Briar Rock is no longer safe, where will you go?"
"204987124-0-64847";"Why are you not with the others?"
"204987124-0-64849";"I understand."
"204987124-0-64853";"The Empire's gone. Why are you still here?"
"204987124-0-64854";"Faorin respects your judgment. He'll listen to you."
"204987124-0-64856";"Arana and her Wayward Guardians could use your help."
"204987124-0-64857";"What sort of work are you offering?"
"204987124-0-64858";"Should we go after them?"
"204987124-0-64859";"Let's go find a way into that Dwarven ruin."
"204987124-0-64862";"What about the Nighthollow vampires?"
"204987124-0-64864";"What's harrowcraft?"
"204987124-0-64865";"So Lady Belain wants Nathari to perform a ritual sacrifice to awaken the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-64869";"Faorin respects your judgment. He'll listen to you."
"204987124-0-64871";"So now you serve Arana?"
"204987124-0-64873";"I'll wait for you outside."
"204987124-0-64874";"What are you negotiating for?"
"204987124-0-64875";"So you're in charge of all the clans?"
"204987124-0-64876";"Why don't you and Chief Eagleseer get along?"
"204987124-0-64878";"Do the offerings hold power?"
"204987124-0-64881";"Did you say you made peace with the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-64883";"The Ghostsong clan? That's an unusual name."
"204987124-0-64884";"I'm a werewolf. What will they think of me?"
"204987124-0-64885";"Tell me more about this vateshran we're going to see."
"204987124-0-64886";"Do you think the vateshran will be able to help?"
"204987124-0-64889";"You said you'd tell me about you and Adusa after you fed."
"204987124-0-64891";"Something else?"
"204987124-0-64892";"Should I destroy these supplies if I find them?"
"204987124-0-64893";"I spent some time researching harrowstorms in Western Skyrim."
"204987124-0-64894";"Icereach witches?"
"204987124-0-64895";"Tell me about these scrolls and the tome you want me to find."
"204987124-0-64896";"Tell me about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64897";"What were the dwellings made of?"
"204987124-0-64898";"And you said the camp was along an underground river?"
"204987124-0-64899";"Tell me about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64900";"Why do you need me to bring back the Gray Host sigils?"
"204987124-0-64901";"Tell me about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64902";"Then why bother to cleanse Lorkh's shrine?"
"204987124-0-64903";"Everyone dies eventually."
"204987124-0-64904";"Tell me about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64905";"But Dwarven metal isn't the bounty from a hunt. What makes the Wayward Guardians different?"
"204987124-0-64906";"Tell me about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64907";"Tell me more about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64908";"What do you know about the Library of Arkthzand?"
"204987124-0-64909";"Tell me more about the Wayward Guardians."
"204987124-0-64910";"What do you think I should do?"
"204987124-0-64913";"I understand."
"204987124-0-64914";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-64916";"I heard them call you witch-rebels. Are you a witch?"
"204987124-0-64917";"I heard them call you witch-rebels. Are you a witch?"
"204987124-0-64918";"I heard them call you witch-rebels. Are you a witch?"
"204987124-0-64919";"Ard Caddach made peace with the Gray Host. Why are you still fighting?"
"204987124-0-64920";"Ard Caddach made peace with the Gray Host. Why are you still fighting?"
"204987124-0-64924";"What are you going to do about Freyleth and the Lothid clan?"
"204987124-0-64925";"What's next for Adusa-daro?"
"204987124-0-64926";"You seem to know a lot about plants."
"204987124-0-64928";"Would Nathari talk to me?"
"204987124-0-64930";"I'll meet you and Bradan at Hroldan Ring."
"204987124-0-64931";"Have you decided to join the Ravenwatch?"
"204987124-0-64932";"How did Lady Belain learn about the prophecy?"
"204987124-0-64933";"What do you mean, literally?"
"204987124-0-64935";"So your mother and the other witches told her about the prophecy?"
"204987124-0-64936";"What does the Prophecy of the Dark Heart actually say?"
"204987124-0-64937";"This is a challenge for children?"
"204987124-0-64938";"Do you think he's in any danger?"
"204987124-0-64939";"How did you end up joining them?"
"204987124-0-64940";"Tell me more about Master Pythis."
"204987124-0-64941";"Can you describe what's happening to the plants?"
"204987124-0-64942";"Can you describe what's happening to the vegetation?"
"204987124-0-64943";"That's twice you mentioned damaging it. What did you do?"
"204987124-0-64944";"Can it be stopped?"
"204987124-0-64945";"Where was the relic kept before you took it?"
"204987124-0-64947";"Eslyn, Madearn, does this give you an idea of how to resolve the feud?"
"204987124-0-64948";"Eslyn, Madearn, does this give you an idea of how to resolve the feud?"
"204987124-0-64949";"I'll bring the messages with me. [Take Bundle of Old Life Messages]"
"204987124-0-64952";"Tell me more about your sister."
"204987124-0-64953";"Are things back to normal in Western Skyrim now?"
"204987124-0-64954";"Are things back to normal in Western Skyrim now?"
"204987124-0-64955";"You mentioned Lyris's companion. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-64958";"How did you manage to escape from Coldharbour?"
"204987124-0-64960";"Rada al-Saran said he needs something called the Arkthzand Keystone. He sent Belain to find it."
"204987124-0-64963";"All right, I'll find Nolovan and ask him about the Arkthzand Keystone."
"204987124-0-64966";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64967";"Why has the Gray Host come to the Reach?"
"204987124-0-64968";"Tell me more about the Reachmen worship of Hircine."
"204987124-0-64969";"Tell me more about the Reachman veneration of Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-64970";"Why do people of the Reach venerate hardship?"
"204987124-0-64971";"What can you do about it?"
"204987124-0-64972";"If you suspected she was working with the Gray Host, why allow her to remain in your court?"
"204987124-0-64973";"Now that you know for sure, what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-64974";"My lips are sealed."
"204987124-0-64975";"No."
"204987124-0-64977";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-64979";"I see."
"204987124-0-64980";"I'll retrieve the Symbol of Uricanbeg. Where can I find it?"
"204987124-0-64981";"The Symbol of Uricanbeg is a drum?"
"204987124-0-64983";"Why do you think Hircine is testing you?"
"204987124-0-64984";"Hircine doesn't care if I help you?"
"204987124-0-64985";"The Symbol of Uricanbeg is a drum?"
"204987124-0-64986";"The Symbol of Uricanbeg is a drum?"
"204987124-0-64987";"Do you think the Order will punish you?"
"204987124-0-64989";"And none of them have returned yet?"
"204987124-0-64990";"You think your other apprentices are all dead?"
"204987124-0-64992";"What will you do now that the fight is over?"
"204987124-0-64993";"What's so important about these letters?"
"204987124-0-64995";"What's so important about these letters?"
"204987124-0-64998";"Have you had any luck recruiting?"
"204987124-0-65000";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-65003";"Have you spoken with Drisene?"
"204987124-0-65006";"Have you been to Markarth before?"
"204987124-0-65007";"How are things with your daughter?"
"204987124-0-65008";"Slop?"
"204987124-0-65010";"So what's next for Sai Sahan?"
"204987124-0-65012";"Don't mention it."
"204987124-0-65013";"How's Kathad doing, by the way?"
"204987124-0-65016";"What does a Reach hero know about Redguard traditions?"
"204987124-0-65017";"Does that mean you're getting along?"
"204987124-0-65020";"And what about Kathad?"
"204987124-0-65035";"All right. I'll participate in your ritual. What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-65036";"Right. I remember Verandis used that in Nighthollow Keep."
"204987124-0-65039";"How do I get to Lost Valley Redoubt?"
"204987124-0-65041";"How do you think it will help us here?"
"204987124-0-65042";"Is that why the search for the Dark Heart is leading us to Nighthollow Keep?"
"204987124-0-65043";"Could these Nighthollow vampires be related to Rada al-Saran?"
"204987124-0-65044";"I'll look for void portals and watch for memories as I explore."
"204987124-0-65045";"All right. Let's go find Bthar-Zel."
"204987124-0-65046";"I'll let Count Verandis know."
"204987124-0-65051";"So what will you be doing while I'm trying to see Ard Caddach?"
"204987124-0-65052";"How did you come to cook for Reachmen?"
"204987124-0-65056";"So, you saved the entire clan? They must have been grateful."
"204987124-0-65058";"What will you do here?"
"204987124-0-65059";"What did you mean, we're bound together?"
"204987124-0-65060";"What did you mean, we're bound together?"
"204987124-0-65061";"Have you ever heard of the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"204987124-0-65062";"So, if someone breaks this alliance …?"
"204987124-0-65065";"That sounds unfair."
"204987124-0-65068";"Let's move forward."
"204987124-0-65070";"I'll meet each of them at the appointed place."
"204987124-0-65072";"What did you mean that Vateshran Hollows has behaved strangely?"
"204987124-0-65074";"You're teaching him how to tell his own clan's stories?"
"204987124-0-65076";"What do you get from this arrangement?"
"204987124-0-65077";"Does he know of your expertise?"
"204987124-0-65078";"You were the clan's first vateshran?"
"204987124-0-65079";"Can you help me understand the Choosing?"
"204987124-0-65080";"How about the green portal?"
"204987124-0-65081";"What should I know about the red portal?"
"204987124-0-65082";"How about the green portal?"
"204987124-0-65083";"What is through this blue portal?"
"204987124-0-65086";"But what will the Darkstorm do?"
"204987124-0-65087";"What's next for us?"
"204987124-0-65089";"Tell me about this Binder in the Dark."
"204987124-0-65100";"Can you think of anything your clan might have done to offend him?"
"204987124-0-65101";"Help me understand."
"204987124-0-65103";"What kinds of things are you supposed to give in return?"
"204987124-0-65104";"So each clan is fighting its own war?"
"204987124-0-65105";"Which way do you think is best?"
"204987124-0-65108";"What does Rada al-Saran plan to use the orrery for?"
"204987124-0-65109";"A vested interest?"
"204987124-0-65110";"I should stay here and help you stop Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-65111";"Unspeakable horrors?"
"204987124-0-65112";"So why do you care what happens to this Kathad?"
"204987124-0-65115";"How do we stop the Darkstorm?"
"204987124-0-65116";"How do we enter Rada al-Saran's sanctuary realm?"
"204987124-0-65117";"What kind of disguise?"
"204987124-0-65118";"And the rest of the clan is just going to let this happen?"
"204987124-0-65120";"Rada al-Saran was in the orrery chamber. Verandis was going to try to confront him there."
"204987124-0-65121";"Get him into trouble? How so?"
"204987124-0-65124";"What do you plan to do while we're gone?"
"204987124-0-65125";"Are you sure it's a good idea to leave you here alone?"
"204987124-0-65127";"Why would Caddach help Mannimarco?"
"204987124-0-65128";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-65129";"I understand."
"204987124-0-65130";"All right."
"204987124-0-65131";"I'll be right behind you."
"204987124-0-65133";"Why didn't you realize Lady Belain is a vampire?"
"204987124-0-65134";"But you must have encountered something like it in all your travels."
"204987124-0-65135";"You seem conflicted about Rada al-Saran."
"204987124-0-65136";"Using it as a power source or a key seems more likely, seeing that they took it to that ruin."
"204987124-0-65137";"Any idea what this place might have been?"
"204987124-0-65139";"Won't you get bored?"
"204987124-0-65140";"You sacrificed yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings. You should be dead!"
"204987124-0-65144";"She's probably just teasing you."
"204987124-0-65145";"You regret that?"
"204987124-0-65148";"Have you found your answer?"
"204987124-0-65153";"If Briar Rock is no longer safe, where will you go?"
"204987124-0-65155";"Do you think it will?"
"204987124-0-65157";"Killer wolves?"
"204987124-0-65159";"I'll speak with her next time I'm passing through."
"204987124-0-65162";"Who's traveling with you?"
"204987124-0-65163";"Who's traveling with you?"
"204987124-0-65164";"I'll speak with him."
"204987124-0-65165";"Why are you recruiting outsiders to do this work?"
"204987124-0-65166";"You could ask the Ravenwatch."
"204987124-0-65167";"Why are you recruiting outsiders to do this work?"
"204987124-0-65168";"The Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-65170";"All right, I'll help you gather information and get an audience with the Despot of Markarth."
"204987124-0-65174";"But the Reachfolk are barbarians, aren't they?"
"204987124-0-65175";"So the Gray Host is still a threat?"
"204987124-0-65177";"But Rada al-Saran is still out there."
"204987124-0-65178";"What was that about Verandis and the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-65180";"Should we go after Rada al-Saran now?"
"204987124-0-65181";"What about the remnants of the Gray Host army?"
"204987124-0-65183";"I'll consider that. Have I done enough that you'll agree to talk to Count Verandis now?"
"204987124-0-65184";"Will this cover the cost of the map?"
"204987124-0-65188";"Is Aydolan lost forever?"
"204987124-0-65192";"Did you get any impressions from the Arkthzand Keystone?"
"204987124-0-65193";"What about the silver we saw down here?"
"204987124-0-65195";"Why were you exploring the old xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-65196";"And that was important?"
"204987124-0-65198";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-65199";"But we have to stop Rada al-Saran, right?"
"204987124-0-65200";"One? There's more than one here."
"204987124-0-65201";"I'll find the missing Stibbons duplicate."
"204987124-0-65202";"Now what?"
"204987124-0-65204";"What are the duplicates, exactly?"
"204987124-0-65205";"What do the duplicates want?"
"204987124-0-65206";"Is the real Stibbons in any danger?"
"204987124-0-65207";"What are the duplicates, exactly?"
"204987124-0-65209";"Master? Who's your master?"
"204987124-0-65211";"Before the duplicate exploded, it said something about a master."
"204987124-0-65212";"Going? Where?"
"204987124-0-65214";"Let's go talk to Nisswo Somarz."
"204987124-0-65216";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-65217";"So what can we do to stop the sorcerer and remove the curse?"
"204987124-0-65218";"What does this have to do with the Stibbons duplicates?"
"204987124-0-65220";"What will I find in the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-65221";"Can you tell me anything else about the sorcerer?"
"204987124-0-65222";"Can you tell me anything else about the sorcerer?"
"204987124-0-65223";"I honestly don't know anyone else who might want to help."
"204987124-0-65225";"I'll speak to the Ambitions, then ask Captain Rian to join us at Fort Redmane."
"204987124-0-65228";"I'll meet you there. First I'm going to try to gather additional allies to help defend the fort."
"204987124-0-65232";"I'm sure they'll be glad to see you whenever you do."
"204987124-0-65233";"I will."
"204987124-0-65234";"Until next time."
"204987124-0-65236";"You think the floor plate will open the door?"
"204987124-0-65239";"We think so. Keshu doesn't want to fight the cult in the city."
"204987124-0-65240";"Thank you, captain."
"204987124-0-65245";"And once I get the duplicate to the other side?"
"204987124-0-65246";"You mentioned defenses?"
"204987124-0-65249";"Why would the Thornroot clan ally with Hagravens?"
"204987124-0-65253";"It'll be all right, Eveli."
"204987124-0-65256";"What does the Thornroot clan have to do with the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-65257";"Do you think we need to defend the gates? Shouldn't we just prepare for them to portal inside?"
"204987124-0-65272";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-65275";"I'm working for Captain Rian Liore. He sent me to find the councilor. What's that about a secret?"
"204987124-0-65276";"I found a letter to Councilor Jirich from Farrul Lupus. It warned her she was in danger."
"204987124-0-65277";"Who are the other councilors?"
"204987124-0-65278";"Right. The secret concerning the Four Ambitions of Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-65282";"What kind of assistance are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-65283";"All right, I'll try to shatter the ward."
"204987124-0-65284";"How do I shatter the ward?"
"204987124-0-65285";"Where were the Ambitions going?"
"204987124-0-65287";"Why would Rada al-Saran allow Lady Belain to lead his army?"
"204987124-0-65288";"Why would Rada al-Saran allow Lady Belain to lead his army?"
"204987124-0-65289";"A vested interest?"
"204987124-0-65290";"Shouldn't one of us go and help Verandis?"
"204987124-0-65291";"""King Boar?"""
"204987124-0-65292";"Yes, I'll battle King Boar."
"204987124-0-65293";"So I just go into the Arena and kill a giant phantom pig?"
"204987124-0-65294";"Caddach says Mannimarco offered the land to Molag Bal."
"204987124-0-65296";"So how do we break the curse?"
"204987124-0-65297";"What do you make of the schematics?"
"204987124-0-65300";"And what do you think the map signifies?"
"204987124-0-65301";"What are your plans for Markarth now that there's peace?"
"204987124-0-65302";"So you're making peace with Arana, too?"
"204987124-0-65304";"If the sorcerer has Stibbons and his duplicates, why hasn't he escaped already?"
"204987124-0-65305";"And do you still sense the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-65308";"The Dark Brotherhood has already murdered Farrul Lupus and Councilor Jirich."
"204987124-0-65310";"Your records include information on the Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-65311";"We think it has something to do with Leovic's secret. Something called the Four Ambitions."
"204987124-0-65312";"Your records include information on Leovic's secret?"
"204987124-0-65313";"Captain Rian sent me to check on Councilor Sophus."
"204987124-0-65318";"We should take this to Verandis. He's waiting for us at the Arkthzand orrery."
"204987124-0-65319";"Will you two be traveling together?"
"204987124-0-65321";"Safe travels then."
"204987124-0-65322";"I entered Verandis's memories back in Rivenspire to help him remember something. This seems easier."
"204987124-0-65323";"A scroll?"
"204987124-0-65325";"I suppose Ard Caddach and I have a rapport."
"204987124-0-65326";"Ard Caddach says we can reach the place where the land was sundered by going through Nchuand-Zel."
"204987124-0-65329";"Your brother Beragon helped us before. Do you think he can decipher it?"
"204987124-0-65330";"How well did you know Councilor Jirich?"
"204987124-0-65332";"I'll meet you at Leyawiin Castle."
"204987124-0-65334";"I'll meet you at Leyawiin Castle."
"204987124-0-65335";"Why would Caddach help Mannimarco?"
"204987124-0-65336";"How does the Idol of Xulunaht work?"
"204987124-0-65338";"We gathered a few documents we think Councilor Lovidicus should see."
"204987124-0-65339";"You mentioned your soldiers were stretched too thin?"
"204987124-0-65340";"The legates?"
"204987124-0-65343";"Jirich and Sophus left behind documents, but part of them is written in code."
"204987124-0-65344";"But weren't you the chief councilor of the Elder Council?"
"204987124-0-65345";"You don't think the fort is safe?"
"204987124-0-65346";"Councilor Faleria is under guard and collecting her records from Tidewater Cave."
"204987124-0-65347";"I'll go to Fort Blueblood and talk to Councilor Abor."
"204987124-0-65348";"How did you meet Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-65349";"Sword-saint?"
"204987124-0-65350";"Why is that servant in an uproar?"
"204987124-0-65351";"Did you see where she went when she came back out?"
"204987124-0-65355";"Why didn't you tell us sooner?"
"204987124-0-65356";"What did you say?"
"204987124-0-65357";"What brings you to Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-65358";"How are you dealing with your connection to the Dark Heart?"
"204987124-0-65359";"Sombren thinks he can use your book to help us defeat Vandacia."
"204987124-0-65361";"The Dremora who helped us, Lyranth. That's what she called it."
"204987124-0-65362";"Will that help us defeat him and return Fort Redmane to Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-65364";"Then do what you can, Sombren. We'll be ready."
"204987124-0-65365";"Vandacia surprised us. He was too powerful. That's why we need to give Sombren time to use the book."
"204987124-0-65369";"I'll find Vandacia and give you and Sombren the time you need."
"204987124-0-65370";"Rada al-Saran has a laboratory? I thought he left those kinds of tasks to others."
"204987124-0-65371";"Do you know where your family might be?"
"204987124-0-65372";"What's been happening in your village?"
"204987124-0-65374";"What will you do now that the fighting is over?"
"204987124-0-65375";"What did you mean when you said you know the Reachmen have a strong sense of honor?"
"204987124-0-65377";"Tell me more about the cult."
"204987124-0-65379";"Tell me more about the cult."
"204987124-0-65382";"What are you doing here, Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-65383";"What's so important about these letters?"
"204987124-0-65384";"Can't hurt to ask?"
"204987124-0-65386";"And you don't know what happened to them?"
"204987124-0-65387";"What can you tell me about the Painted Eye?"
"204987124-0-65388";"Did the Thieves Guild send you to do this?"
"204987124-0-65391";"Are you lost?"
"204987124-0-65392";"Seeks? Who's that?"
"204987124-0-65393";"You're part of the Thieves Guild?"
"204987124-0-65395";"Are you lost?"
"204987124-0-65396";"So, you got caught by the Painted Eye?"
"204987124-0-65397";"Sombren proved himself. Maybe he can do some good with that book and help find the Fourth Ambition."
"204987124-0-65399";"All right. Let Sombren hang onto the book for now."
"204987124-0-65401";"All right. Let Sombren hang onto the book for now."
"204987124-0-65402";"Food is more important to you than the threat of Mehrunes Dagon?"
"204987124-0-65404";"If you say so."
"204987124-0-65405";"Tenarei's got a head start on you."
"204987124-0-65406";"You think a treasure like that was left here?"
"204987124-0-65407";"Sombren will figure out how to teach you to control your power."
"204987124-0-65410";"What will you do with the Mysterium Xarxes?"
"204987124-0-65411";"Mehrunes Dagon said you would join him or die. We need to make sure neither of those things happen."
"204987124-0-65412";"What will you do with the Mysterium Xarxes?"
"204987124-0-65413";"Your combined forces helped save Sombren and Calia."
"204987124-0-65415";"Do you think we've seen the last of the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-65417";"What else do you know about this place?"
"204987124-0-65418";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-65419";"Who was Gavos Douar?"
"204987124-0-65421";"Let's go find Quistley."
"204987124-0-65426";"What are Zenithar's teachings?"
"204987124-0-65427";"Tell me more about this Golden Anvil we are searching for."
"204987124-0-65429";"Do you have a plan?"
"204987124-0-65430";"If they successfully overthrew Gavos, why did this place sink into ruin?"
"204987124-0-65431";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-65434";"Why are a pair of thieves rescuing hostages?"
"204987124-0-65435";"Commander Axius said they were impossible demands."
"204987124-0-65436";"If they don't care about their demands, what are they really after?"
"204987124-0-65438";"Make for the cellars—there's a woman waiting to sneak you out of the fortress."
"204987124-0-65440";"Did they say what they were planning?"
"204987124-0-65441";"So they're searching for something in the fortress, and may be close to finding it."
"204987124-0-65443";"Head for the cellars. There's a woman waiting to sneak you out of the fortress."
"204987124-0-65445";"What scholar? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-65446";"I have someone waiting to sneak you out of the fortress. Meet them at the cellars."
"204987124-0-65448";"Fine. Stay behind me, and stay close."
"204987124-0-65450";"So, you came here to steal something?"
"204987124-0-65451";"What does this relic do?"
"204987124-0-65452";"You might want to turn around."
"204987124-0-65454";"Relicmaster Glenadir? I helped him deal with cursed relics in Summerset."
"204987124-0-65455";"Where should I look for the Ayleid scholar?"
"204987124-0-65456";"Who hired you to steal the relic from the Ayleid ruin?"
"204987124-0-65457";"And when he wouldn't surrender, they sealed him in."
"204987124-0-65458";"We have to find them first."
"204987124-0-65459";"Where is the entrance to the ruin?"
"204987124-0-65460";"Do you know anything that'll help us beat them to the ruin?"
"204987124-0-65462";"Where can I find the key to the crypt?"
"204987124-0-65463";"Why do you keep putting such emphasis on being Teldundindo of Sunhold?"
"204987124-0-65466";"I'm curious about these relics we're after."
"204987124-0-65468";"You said Phalevon had a really sharp sword?"
"204987124-0-65469";"Tell me about Phalevon's armor."
"204987124-0-65470";"You still rescued the hostages."
"204987124-0-65474";"And they accept that?"
"204987124-0-65476";"How'd you wind up falling into the ruins anyway?"
"204987124-0-65477";"That led you to the ruin?"
"204987124-0-65479";"And that finally led you to the ruin?"
"204987124-0-65485";"Wait. Who are these people? Why did they take you prisoner?"
"204987124-0-65487";"The Wood Elf saw Tenarei Vels come through not long ago. She wants Quistley alive, too."
"204987124-0-65488";"Why are you responsible for Quistley?"
"204987124-0-65489";"So you and Quistley are like brothers?"
"204987124-0-65490";"How many times have you had to get Quistley out of trouble?"
"204987124-0-65491";"You said you owe the Silvelles a debt?"
"204987124-0-65494";"This event sounds like Vandacia plans to reveal something special to his followers."
"204987124-0-65495";"All right, I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-65496";"His new charge?"
"204987124-0-65498";"Tell me more about this event. Where is it and how do I get there?"
"204987124-0-65499";"So you think we should get aboard that ship?"
"204987124-0-65501";"Do you know where the tailor's shop is located?"
"204987124-0-65503";"No, thank you. We really need formal attire."
"204987124-0-65504";"When Eveli found out that you hadn't been completely honest with her, she decided to be cautious."
"204987124-0-65505";"How are you going to help Keshu and her spymaster?"
"204987124-0-65506";"What does Vandacia plan to do with that power?"
"204987124-0-65507";"Treachery?"
"204987124-0-65510";"What sort of arrangement?"
"204987124-0-65511";"Fine. Where is Lalais, then? When will she sacrifice Quistley?"
"204987124-0-65512";"We know that Farrul Lupus was Emperor Leovic's steward."
"204987124-0-65516";"Then if we're ready, let's head over to the Leyawiin docks."
"204987124-0-65517";"Bastian, what do you want to do with this cultist?"
"204987124-0-65519";"Carefully talk to the other guests, check. Then what?"
"204987124-0-65521";"This place looks huge!"
"204987124-0-65522";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-65524";"How did you get out of your vault? And what's that about a mentor?"
"204987124-0-65525";"Good idea. I'll tell Eveli, then meet you at the shrine."
"204987124-0-65526";"Do you think this mentor can help Calia and Destron learn to control their powers?"
"204987124-0-65527";"How do you feel now?"
"204987124-0-65529";"We won't let that happen."
"204987124-0-65530";"Then why was Vandacia planning to kill you?"
"204987124-0-65531";"Governor Keshu suggested we might want to leave Gideon for a while."
"204987124-0-65532";"But you believe your mentor can teach them to control their powers?"
"204987124-0-65533";"How did you wind up locked in the Deadlands, by the way?"
"204987124-0-65534";"What do you mean when you say Calia's power will consume her?"
"204987124-0-65535";"How did that come about?"
"204987124-0-65536";"What do you mean when you say Calia's power will consume her?"
"204987124-0-65537";"I still don't understand how she found you."
"204987124-0-65539";"What about Tenarei Vels?"
"204987124-0-65540";"I'll see you later."
"204987124-0-65541";"All right."
"204987124-0-65542";"And what's your role in all this?"
"204987124-0-65544";"Is that what you are? One of the Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-65545";"What are you thinking, Eveli?"
"204987124-0-65546";"Sounds like a plan."
"204987124-0-65547";"Do you have something in mind?"
"204987124-0-65548";"I should take you to the other Ambitions."
"204987124-0-65549";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-65550";"Yes. We want to make sure Calia and Destron don't destroy themselves with their own power."
"204987124-0-65551";"Where is your sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-65553";"I know a Dremora. She must want something out of you."
"204987124-0-65554";"All right, I'll take the twins and find these slivers of the Deadlands."
"204987124-0-65555";"Tell me about this attunement process Xynaa was talking about."
"204987124-0-65558";"And what's my role in this?"
"204987124-0-65559";"A complication?"
"204987124-0-65561";"I'll make sure the way is clear and meet you at the top."
"204987124-0-65562";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-65564";"Very well, I'll help."
"204987124-0-65565";"You don't sound very excited about it."
"204987124-0-65566";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-65567";"You couldn't find restless ghosts in your homeland?"
"204987124-0-65568";"How do I paint these runes?"
"204987124-0-65569";"What will you and Tiras do while I'm gone?"
"204987124-0-65571";"All right, I'll go paint those runes."
"204987124-0-65572";"So … about those runes?"
"204987124-0-65573";"What brings you to Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-65574";"Isn't Revus your teacher? Why are you talking about him like this?"
"204987124-0-65577";"Do the other Telvanni mages share your low opinion of Revus?"
"204987124-0-65579";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-65580";"How will I know which pylon to attune?"
"204987124-0-65582";"Thanks for the warning. I'll keep my eyes on the pylons."
"204987124-0-65584";"You're some kind of cultist, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-65585";"What happened to the Golden Anvil?"
"204987124-0-65586";"Why blame yourself? The trade-ministers caused all this."
"204987124-0-65587";"When can I try it?"
"204987124-0-65588";"I should discuss this with Daluion."
"204987124-0-65589";"They claimed you stole it for yourself."
"204987124-0-65591";"What happened to the Golden Anvil?"
"204987124-0-65592";"What caused it to fade?"
"204987124-0-65593";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-65594";"All right. What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-65595";"Missed something like what?"
"204987124-0-65597";"I want to see this through. I'll talk to the courier."
"204987124-0-65598";"So, what can we do to fix it?"
"204987124-0-65600";"All right. I'll help Tiras find the source of the interference."
"204987124-0-65601";"Is the Telvanni Council's approval really that important?"
"204987124-0-65602";"I freed Bastian and found your contract with Larz-Tul."
"204987124-0-65603";"Naga?"
"204987124-0-65604";"Do you know anything about this place?"
"204987124-0-65605";"Very well. Let's go."
"204987124-0-65607";"How much of a debt does Quistley Silvelle owe this Larz-Tul?"
"204987124-0-65608";"You said something about a map?"
"204987124-0-65609";"How did you end up in debt to Larz-Tul?"
"204987124-0-65610";"Do you think we'll be able to fix it?"
"204987124-0-65611";"I see."
"204987124-0-65618";"You seem willing to trust me."
"204987124-0-65621";"I'll talk to the vampire."
"204987124-0-65622";"Are you sure he's dead? He just vanished, right?"
"204987124-0-65624";"I'll find the censer. You take a moment."
"204987124-0-65626";"You seem willing to trust me."
"204987124-0-65628";"Why don't you just turn to mist?"
"204987124-0-65630";"So, what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-65632";"That sounds bad."
"204987124-0-65635";"I don't trust you. You'd better stay there for now."
"204987124-0-65638";"How confident are you that this will work?"
"204987124-0-65639";"I see."
"204987124-0-65645";"When did that happen?"
"204987124-0-65646";"Was Vandacia in charge of the city before he revealed his connection to the cult?"
"204987124-0-65647";"Where is Vandacia now?"
"204987124-0-65648";"What do you know about Gideon?"
"204987124-0-65649";"What can you tell me about Keshu?"
"204987124-0-65650";"What can you tell me about Keshu?"
"204987124-0-65651";"So who do you think killed him? I found this sheet of paper on his body."
"204987124-0-65653";"Tell us what you know about this secret. Everything we found so far led us here."
"204987124-0-65654";"What do you suggest, then?"
"204987124-0-65655";"We need to locate Quistley first. Alive or dead."
"204987124-0-65658";"Did this secret involve something called the Four Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-65661";"Tenarei knows where the Fane is. Although she thinks Quistley may have been sacrificed already."
"204987124-0-65662";"Someone has to pay Quistley's debts in Leyawiin."
"204987124-0-65663";"No duels. Let's just find Quistley and then we can figure out what to do."
"204987124-0-65665";"Will Quistley go along with that?"
"204987124-0-65666";"Bastian tells me your parents demand your presence."
"204987124-0-65667";"That sounds risky."
"204987124-0-65669";"What about Tenarei?"
"204987124-0-65673";"I'm not sure the decision is up to you, Quistley."
"204987124-0-65676";"I'll speak to him and see what he's thinking."
"204987124-0-65679";"Here you go. And our coin, too. Eveli here will be accompanying me."
"204987124-0-65681";"What kind of dreams?"
"204987124-0-65682";"What kind of animals?"
"204987124-0-65687";"There's something beneath the Imperial City?"
"204987124-0-65689";"All right, let's go see what's waiting for us in the Imperial sewers."
"204987124-0-65692";"I'll protect the twins and witness what they learn."
"204987124-0-65693";"Maybe the Dark Brotherhood wants the Daedric weapons for themselves."
"204987124-0-65697";"What do you think of House Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-65698";"Can you tell me more about the Phantasmal Censer?"
"204987124-0-65699";"So is Gideon part of the Ebonheart Pact?"
"204987124-0-65700";"Do you know anything about the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-65701";"Ancient Argonians?"
"204987124-0-65703";"You're telling me you won? That now you sit on the Ruby Throne?"
"204987124-0-65707";"This is a lie. When I find you, I'll destroy you."
"204987124-0-65708";"You had no idea Vandacia was the leader of a Daedric cult?"
"204987124-0-65709";"How long have you been the governor of Gideon?"
"204987124-0-65710";"How long have you been the governor of Gideon?"
"204987124-0-65711";"You learn to control your power and we stand against them together."
"204987124-0-65712";"The Sul-Xan tribe? Are they going to be a problem?"
"204987124-0-65713";"What kind of trouble?"
"204987124-0-65715";"We understand. Where is this pit of the outsider?"
"204987124-0-65719";"Destroying yourself isn't the answer. You need to learn to control your powers and stand with me."
"204987124-0-65724";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-65726";"How do you listen?"
"204987124-0-65727";"Grown and intensified to what end?"
"204987124-0-65728";"Transformed in what way?"
"204987124-0-65731";"I'll be watching you. Closely."
"204987124-0-65732";"I found a record of a bargain made between Durcorach the Black Drake and Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-65733";"She mentioned Mehrunes Dagon. I think she plans to give the twins to him."
"204987124-0-65736";"Some sort of weapons, the Four Ambitions. And I found a list. People who apparently know the secret."
"204987124-0-65737";"How will we help the twins if Xynaa refuses to show them how to control their power?"
"204987124-0-65739";"You rest. Just tell me where to find the skull."
"204987124-0-65740";"The leaves help you understand the trees?"
"204987124-0-65741";"Another what?"
"204987124-0-65745";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-65746";"You're sure you want me to contact this ghost, then?"
"204987124-0-65747";"But we don't know any specifics."
"204987124-0-65748";"How will you convince Lovidicus that he may be in danger?"
"204987124-0-65750";"What happens if we can't avoid the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-65751";"Could the Sul-Xan and the Order of the Waking Flame be working together?"
"204987124-0-65756";"Tell me about this seed we're searching for."
"204987124-0-65760";"Where is the pantry?"
"204987124-0-65764";"All right. I'll test this lantern of yours."
"204987124-0-65765";"What do you mean, the councilor reeks of fear?"
"204987124-0-65779";"Is this plant really worth all the risk?"
"204987124-0-65782";"I wonder where the fourth Ambition is. So far, we only know of three of you."
"204987124-0-65783";"We'll find a way to defeat Vandacia and save the Ambitions. All of you."
"204987124-0-65786";"Take the twins back to the temple while I go talk to Keshu. We'll come up with something."
"204987124-0-65787";"What happens after that?"
"204987124-0-65789";"You really think the Waking Flame cultists are out here?"
"204987124-0-65791";"Why did Alizinda kill your son?"
"204987124-0-65793";"What do they have the captives doing?"
"204987124-0-65794";"I'll find them."
"204987124-0-65795";"She said the captives are in the heart of the ruin."
"204987124-0-65798";"All right, I'll go to the cottage and speak with your son, Mathen."
"204987124-0-65799";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-65801";"There's only one way to find out. Let's go talk to Mathen."
"204987124-0-65802";"Why are these three Shadowscales so important?"
"204987124-0-65804";"I wish you luck."
"204987124-0-65805";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-65806";"Do you think the ring belonged to her as well?"
"204987124-0-65808";"All right, I'll light the lantern to call out Mathen's ghost."
"204987124-0-65809";"So, if Alizinda didn't lay a curse on you, why are you and your mother still here?"
"204987124-0-65811";"Do you think this golden armor could be what's keeping you here?"
"204987124-0-65812";"Who really placed the curse on the castle?"
"204987124-0-65814";"All right, I'll light the lantern again."
"204987124-0-65815";"Wait, you tried to bring Mathen back from the dead?"
"204987124-0-65817";"All right, I'll look for your notes and Mathen's armor."
"204987124-0-65818";"What happened at the fort?"
"204987124-0-65819";"Are the mercenaries making any demands?"
"204987124-0-65821";"I can infiltrate Borderwatch and free the hostages."
"204987124-0-65822";"They're making political demands?"
"204987124-0-65823";"Who else did you send into the sewer?"
"204987124-0-65831";"We found the ring you planned to give to Alizinda before she murdered you."
"204987124-0-65833";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-65834";"Should we return to Leyawiin and inform Councilor Lovidicus and Captain Rian?"
"204987124-0-65836";"Tell me about the dreams."
"204987124-0-65837";"I can check with Faleria and Vandacia. But we also need to inform Commander Ortin about this murder."
"204987124-0-65838";"I'll report to the commander, contact the two remaining councilors, and then meet you in Leyawiin."
"204987124-0-65840";"What is the House of Reveries?"
"204987124-0-65841";"What are you doing out here?"
"204987124-0-65842";"What happened to Igmund?"
"204987124-0-65843";"No remains?"
"204987124-0-65846";"I'd like to ask you about what happened before Igmund's death."
"204987124-0-65847";"Like she forgot everything?"
"204987124-0-65848";"Could they have been related to her disappearing?"
"204987124-0-65851";"What happened to her?"
"204987124-0-65852";"Are you afraid of Bugtail?"
"204987124-0-65853";"You think there's more she's not telling us?"
"204987124-0-65854";"Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-65857";"I have some other questions, if you're willing to share more."
"204987124-0-65858";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-65859";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-65860";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-65861";"Lady Twilight?"
"204987124-0-65862";"We found that ring of Mara in the cottage. Do you think that might play a role in this?"
"204987124-0-65863";"Maelle Favraud asked me to look for her missing daughter, Annyce. Have you seen her?"
"204987124-0-65864";"How did you and Seeks-the-Dark get involved with this?"
"204987124-0-65866";"Let's head to the play fort."
"204987124-0-65873";"What kind of records did you keep down here?"
"204987124-0-65877";"I'm on my way to warn Councilor Vandacia next."
"204987124-0-65881";"You convinced Alizinda that Mathen meant to marry someone else?"
"204987124-0-65883";"Where is this sword?"
"204987124-0-65884";"How can you be sure the skull will still be nearby?"
"204987124-0-65885";"It was the seeds of the plant you were tending."
"204987124-0-65888";"Is there a way to free you?"
"204987124-0-65890";"All right. I'm sure she wants to talk to you, too."
"204987124-0-65891";"Do you think that's true?"
"204987124-0-65894";"I think you should seize this opportunity for love and keep the ring."
"204987124-0-65895";"What's a vossa-satl?"
"204987124-0-65897";"Councilors Jirich, Sophus, and Abor were murdered. They're all dead."
"204987124-0-65898";"In your work with the Elder Council, you never heard anything about the Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-65900";"The secret concerns the Four Ambitions of Mehrunes Dagon. We're examining old records to learn more."
"204987124-0-65901";"I'll question the prisoner. Where are you holding them?"
"204987124-0-65902";"You believe? Haven't you gone inside yet?"
"204987124-0-65904";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-65908";"So Gideon is part of the Ebonheart Pact?"
"204987124-0-65910";"Any idea what that could be?"
"204987124-0-65911";"All right. I'll head back now."
"204987124-0-65919";"But they all came back. Like you."
"204987124-0-65922";"You make it sound like they're dead."
"204987124-0-65924";"What about the strange book?"
"204987124-0-65925";"You believe? Haven't you gone inside to check?"
"204987124-0-65927";"You know about the strange book?"
"204987124-0-65928";"What's my motivation again?"
"204987124-0-65929";"You're saying Annyce was dealing with Daedra?"
"204987124-0-65930";"How does that help us?"
"204987124-0-65932";"Could be worth investigating. Let's go."
"204987124-0-65934";"What's your interest in all this?"
"204987124-0-65935";"Dangerous in what way?"
"204987124-0-65936";"But what's the story behind King Boar? I want to know why I'm fighting."
"204987124-0-65937";"Tell me more about the Mysterium Xarxes."
"204987124-0-65938";"How do you know the vault is Daedric?"
"204987124-0-65939";"That's not very compelling."
"204987124-0-65940";"This is all for show, right?"
"204987124-0-65941";"This is all for show, right?"
"204987124-0-65942";"Better."
"204987124-0-65945";"So how do we break the ward?"
"204987124-0-65947";"The script?"
"204987124-0-65948";"To find glory."
"204987124-0-65949";"The Argonian?"
"204987124-0-65951";"For treasure."
"204987124-0-65956";"To find rare artifacts."
"204987124-0-65957";"To see new lands."
"204987124-0-65958";"Very well."
"204987124-0-65960";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-65961";"Because your crew is your family."
"204987124-0-65962";"Because your crew is your family."
"204987124-0-65967";"Where is this frog pool?"
"204987124-0-65968";"We found evidence beside numerous murder victims. Members of the Elder Council that you killed."
"204987124-0-65969";"We found evidence beside numerous murder victims. Members of the Elder Council that were killed."
"204987124-0-65972";"Who would want to blame the Dark Brotherhood for these murders?"
"204987124-0-65974";"If you really are innocent, come back to the courthouse with me."
"204987124-0-65978";"The Dark Brotherhood agent denied his organization's involvement. He said he never attacked you."
"204987124-0-65984";"I'm not sure. And why are they assassinating the councilors?"
"204987124-0-65986";"And what happened to Leovic?"
"204987124-0-65987";"Maybe the coded documents Eveli and I recovered can tell us more."
"204987124-0-65991";"Can we wake them?"
"204987124-0-65993";"I'll unlock the door."
"204987124-0-65995";"You didn't find that suspicious?"
"204987124-0-65996";"You think your mother would be happy with a substitute?"
"204987124-0-65997";"Do you know why Cres wanted to trade places?"
"204987124-0-66003";"Why would they choose to become a poor farm girl then?"
"204987124-0-66004";"People need me here. I'd never abandon the real world."
"204987124-0-66006";"These people seem devastated by being woken from their dreams."
"204987124-0-66007";"These people seem devastated by being woken from their dreams."
"204987124-0-66008";"What'd he have to say about it?"
"204987124-0-66009";"It's all right, the real Annyce is with her mother. They're on their way back now."
"204987124-0-66011";"An imposter named Cres. Maelle can explain, I need to catch up to them."
"204987124-0-66012";"We already woke Annyce and everyone else."
"204987124-0-66016";"No, Cres. It's over."
"204987124-0-66017";"You want to be lenient on them?"
"204987124-0-66018";"Beek-ojel? Saxhleel? What do those words mean?"
"204987124-0-66020";"Making a deal with Daedra rarely leads to anything good. We need to send Cres back to Oblivion."
"204987124-0-66023";"That will be for the best."
"204987124-0-66025";"I have no doubt."
"204987124-0-66027";"Will they recover?"
"204987124-0-66028";"Annyce was dreaming of being part of Captain Wereshark's crew. Is that why we saw pirates outside?"
"204987124-0-66029";"Why did your master send you to watch this place?"
"204987124-0-66030";"Does that mean you're not alone out here?"
"204987124-0-66031";"You can't just take on another form?"
"204987124-0-66032";"What happens if we send you back?"
"204987124-0-66033";"Of all the places you could have chosen, why Farmer's Nook?"
"204987124-0-66034";"Right. And Vandacia and his Order of the Waking Flame cult are seeking them, too."
"204987124-0-66035";"Tingling?"
"204987124-0-66039";"All right, let's go look around."
"204987124-0-66040";"What do you think will happen to the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-66041";"Lyranth said it may be Mehrunes Dagon's book, the Mysterium Xarxes."
"204987124-0-66043";"What if they target you again once they regain strength?"
"204987124-0-66044";"Any guess as to what that might be?"
"204987124-0-66045";"Crossing over to where? The invitation never mentioned our final destination."
"204987124-0-66046";"What will you and your friends do now?"
"204987124-0-66047";"And you think these dreams and visions are connected to the strange book you recovered?"
"204987124-0-66053";"What will you and your forces do now?"
"204987124-0-66054";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-66055";"You should know that the Painted Eye's demands were a ruse."
"204987124-0-66061";"How is that a key?"
"204987124-0-66065";"I'm trying to get to the cache before the cultists find it."
"204987124-0-66066";"Do you know where the cache is located?"
"204987124-0-66068";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-66069";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-66070";"What were the cultists up to?"
"204987124-0-66071";"What did the journal say?"
"204987124-0-66072";"What do you mean, a name for yourself?"
"204987124-0-66073";"How is your father?"
"204987124-0-66074";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-66075";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-66077";"All right, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-66079";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-66080";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-66086";"This place certainly feels bigger on the inside than it looked from the outside."
"204987124-0-66088";"Coexist?"
"204987124-0-66095";"Where can we find this contact of yours?"
"204987124-0-66096";"Tell me more about this contact of yours that can break Imperial codes."
"204987124-0-66097";"Because you know me. You trust me. We can depend on Lyranth, to a point."
"204987124-0-66099";"You'd leave us to deal with this on our own, even though the fate of the world may be at stake?"
"204987124-0-66101";"I'll ask her. Were you able to open the ensorcelled scroll we found at the other annex?"
"204987124-0-66102";"Here. We found this ring alongside the scroll."
"204987124-0-66103";"Eveli never mentioned she had a brother before."
"204987124-0-66104";"You were an adventurer and a scribe?"
"204987124-0-66105";"What lead?"
"204987124-0-66107";"How so?"
"204987124-0-66108";"We thought the Ambitions were Daedric weapons, but now I'm not so sure."
"204987124-0-66109";"And you never leave this place or see anyone else?"
"204987124-0-66110";"Why did they lock you in this place?"
"204987124-0-66119";"We're not exactly sure, but we thought they were Daedric weapons."
"204987124-0-66120";"And you never leave or see anyone else?"
"204987124-0-66121";"But you're a prisoner here, right?"
"204987124-0-66128";"Where did they go?"
"204987124-0-66130";"No, just those twins."
"204987124-0-66131";"Between what I saw and what they said, I'm guessing you and your sister are two of the Ambitions."
"204987124-0-66132";"Do you have that kind of power as well?"
"204987124-0-66134";"We'll get you someplace safe."
"204987124-0-66137";"Where should we take them?"
"204987124-0-66138";"We could still use your help. There's more to learn and we still need to stop Vandacia."
"204987124-0-66139";"What can you tell me about Borderwatch?"
"204987124-0-66140";"What can you tell me about Borderwatch?"
"204987124-0-66145";"What will you do with the twins?"
"204987124-0-66147";"I'm not sure."
"204987124-0-66149";"Why would someone do that?"
"204987124-0-66151";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-66152";"Where is Naheesh Nurwul?"
"204987124-0-66153";"Your grandmother told you about Phalevon? I thought you were a scholar."
"204987124-0-66155";"What about the horn?"
"204987124-0-66157";"What kind of assistance are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-66158";"All right, I'll try to shatter the ward."
"204987124-0-66159";"How do I shatter the ward?"
"204987124-0-66161";"What's your theory?"
"204987124-0-66163";"The cultists do seem to be after the same thing Eveli and I are looking for."
"204987124-0-66166";"I'll go with you into the portal."
"204987124-0-66167";"I'm trying to get to the cache before the cultists find it."
"204987124-0-66168";"How are things in Orsinium?"
"204987124-0-66169";"Do you know where the cache is located?"
"204987124-0-66174";"Same as you, apparently. We need to get to that cache before the cultists find it."
"204987124-0-66175";"Why are you looking for the Imperial cache?"
"204987124-0-66176";"Do you know where the cache is located?"
"204987124-0-66177";"Where can I find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-66179";"You said someone hired you?"
"204987124-0-66180";"Do you often take jobs from people you never meet?"
"204987124-0-66181";"What do you know of Black Drake Villa?"
"204987124-0-66182";"Who were those Goblins I just fought?"
"204987124-0-66183";"Someone used magical runes to turn totems into lures, which attracted creatures from the swamp."
"204987124-0-66185";"I'll speak to the lieutenant and then enter Xal Irasotl."
"204987124-0-66186";"We tried destroying the largest one, but failed."
"204987124-0-66187";"The Argonians will free you. Go speak to your captain."
"204987124-0-66189";"Do all nisswo perform last rights for fallen Shadowscales?"
"204987124-0-66190";"What kind of aid are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-66191";"All right, I'll try to shatter the ward."
"204987124-0-66192";"How do I shatter the ward?"
"204987124-0-66193";"Why do you need to burn these Shadowscale skeletons?"
"204987124-0-66194";"Heem-Jas said they've been turned into lures."
"204987124-0-66195";"Help is coming."
"204987124-0-66196";"Claim? I thought you were here for the hostages."
"204987124-0-66197";"Are you lost?"
"204987124-0-66198";"I'll help you find Seeks."
"204987124-0-66200";"You mentioned the fate of the world. Care to elaborate?"
"204987124-0-66202";"And that pile of black hand prints is evidence that they were trying to blame you for the murders."
"204987124-0-66203";"Do you know anything about the cache mentioned in the high priest's orders?"
"204987124-0-66205";"Are you suggesting the Mehrunes Dagon cult has spies in Leyawiin Castle?"
"204987124-0-66206";"Good idea."
"204987124-0-66207";"She seems to yearn for adventure, too."
"204987124-0-66209";"And what should I know about Renna?"
"204987124-0-66210";"Difficult how?"
"204987124-0-66211";"How do we coordinate above and below?"
"204987124-0-66212";"Heem-Jas and l will handle the lures down here."
"204987124-0-66215";"He did, he seemed in good spirits."
"204987124-0-66218";"You said Phalevon had a really sharp sword?"
"204987124-0-66219";"As long as you don't blow the horn, you should be fine. Gideon is not that far."
"204987124-0-66220";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-66221";"Wise choice."
"204987124-0-66224";"When did you last see Annyce?"
"204987124-0-66225";"You're afraid she's vanished like the others?"
"204987124-0-66227";"Where should I start my search for Annyce?"
"204987124-0-66228";"Annyce wants to be a pirate?"
"204987124-0-66230";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-66231";"Did he say what happened?"
"204987124-0-66232";"Who would want to destroy this villa?"
"204987124-0-66233";"Was there anything else unusual about him after he returned?"
"204987124-0-66234";"What sort of things did Cylle bring up before she took you to the swimming hole?"
"204987124-0-66235";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-66236";"I believe you. I've been to Elsweyr and seen the Dragons."
"204987124-0-66238";"What about Bugtail made you and your horses uneasy?"
"204987124-0-66239";"What about Bugtail made you and your horses uneasy?"
"204987124-0-66240";"You think it's a miracle that he's alive? An actual miracle?"
"204987124-0-66241";"You make him sound like a saint."
"204987124-0-66242";"What are you planning to do?"
"204987124-0-66243";"This could be dangerous."
"204987124-0-66247";"It's more than that. Lovidicus has documents that reveal the locations of the remaining Ambitions."
"204987124-0-66251";"And what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-66252";"Does that door lead into the castle?"
"204987124-0-66255";"Vandacia is the cult's high priest. And they know the location of one of the Ambitions."
"204987124-0-66257";"What about the Imperials? Will they forgive Olik?"
"204987124-0-66260";"What's going to happen to Olik?"
"204987124-0-66262";"I see."
"204987124-0-66263";"Did this Quistley run away from home?"
"204987124-0-66266";"Secret gatherings?"
"204987124-0-66267";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-66268";"Hang on. Where did you get a letter from a Dremora?"
"204987124-0-66269";"Private. But thanks for bringing it to me."
"204987124-0-66273";"How can they channel power from the Court?"
"204987124-0-66274";"What's the Evergloam?"
"204987124-0-66275";"All right. How do I sign up for one of these jobs?"
"204987124-0-66277";"Are problems like that common in Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-66278";"How are these items going to bless Leric?"
"204987124-0-66280";"What sorts of things do you need done?"
"204987124-0-66281";"What were the scholars looking for?"
"204987124-0-66282";"The Longhouse Emperors?"
"204987124-0-66283";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-66284";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-66286";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-66295";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-66296";"What sort of work are you hiring for?"
"204987124-0-66297";"I'll help you find Seeks."
"204987124-0-66298";"Are you lost?"
"204987124-0-66299";"Why were you locked up?"
"204987124-0-66300";"What about your brother, Heseph?"
"204987124-0-66301";"Your brother thinks you're dead. He's grieving for you."
"204987124-0-66303";"He'd like that."
"204987124-0-66305";"The deal you made with Cres was a mistake. Your brother thinks you're dead."
"204987124-0-66307";"No, Cres did pretend to be you. They just got drunk and fell in a bonfire."
"204987124-0-66308";"You had a dream about sweetrolls?"
"204987124-0-66310";"Couldn't you have gotten sweetrolls without resorting to Daedric pacts?"
"204987124-0-66311";"I'll go talk to Renna, but what do you mean that something's not right?"
"204987124-0-66313";"What sort of revels would he and his new friends find in a cave?"
"204987124-0-66314";"Are the cultists still here? Or the smugglers?"
"204987124-0-66315";"Did she say anything about her business in Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-66316";"Did this Quistley run away from home?"
"204987124-0-66317";"Did this Quistley run away from home?"
"204987124-0-66319";"I would hope so."
"204987124-0-66320";"You're going then?"
"204987124-0-66322";"Where did you get the amulet you gave me?"
"204987124-0-66323";"Why should I be concerned?"
"204987124-0-66324";"Why do the activities of a Mehrunes Dagon cult concern you?"
"204987124-0-66325";"If the ward is in place, why are you concerned about the cultists reaching the cache first?"
"204987124-0-66326";"You don't sound very fond of Quistley."
"204987124-0-66327";"Have you been looking after Quistley all along?"
"204987124-0-66328";"You don't sound very fond of Quistley."
"204987124-0-66329";"Did Tenarei react when you mentioned your task?"
"204987124-0-66330";"So the ward won't hurt me?"
"204987124-0-66331";"He seemed to have a good sense of humor about it."
"204987124-0-66333";"She laughed about it."
"204987124-0-66337";"Where is <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-66338";"Who's Mehrunes Dagon?"
"204987124-0-66339";"So we still have time to get to the caches first."
"204987124-0-66342";"Do you know anything about this place?"
"204987124-0-66343";"Where can I find <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-66345";"Does Alchemy usually take an interest in local troubles?"
"204987124-0-66346";"I see."
"204987124-0-66350";"You hope to learn the Reachfolk's dance?"
"204987124-0-66353";"You think the people will be up for that?"
"204987124-0-66356";"Do you think Cres will try this again?"
"204987124-0-66357";"Do you have any idea what's happening here?"
"204987124-0-66359";"All right. I'll help you get to the bottom of this."
"204987124-0-66360";"If Quistley isn't to be sacrificed, then who is?"
"204987124-0-66361";"Another sacrifice?"
"204987124-0-66362";"Bastian, what do you want to do with this cultist?"
"204987124-0-66363";"Why would you join a cult devoted to such things?"
"204987124-0-66364";"Bastian, what do you want to do with this cultist?"
"204987124-0-66365";"I'm sorry Farrul Lupus was killed, but what should Eveli do with the book he sent her to find?"
"204987124-0-66367";"Very clever."
"204987124-0-66369";"That is unfortunate."
"204987124-0-66370";"That makes sense."
"204987124-0-66374";"I can handle that."
"204987124-0-66375";"How?"
"204987124-0-66378";"So, you're a writer?"
"204987124-0-66379";"So, what's the story?"
"204987124-0-66380";"What makes you think any of it's true?"
"204987124-0-66381";"So, you're a writer?"
"204987124-0-66382";"Why romance, if you don't mind me asking?"
"204987124-0-66383";"And you think we'll find both in Castle Giovesse?"
"204987124-0-66384";"They live forever?"
"204987124-0-66385";"And the others?"
"204987124-0-66386";"Can you tell me about the living Winds?"
"204987124-0-66388";"A warlord named Naxhosa killed her. The village is undefended."
"204987124-0-66392";"We want to find the other Winds. Do you know where they are?"
"204987124-0-66395";"What can you tell me about this enchanted lantern?"
"204987124-0-66396";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-66397";"I can't argue with that."
"204987124-0-66403";"The village needs you. They'll be overrun without aid."
"204987124-0-66404";"We'll look for Otumi-Ra."
"204987124-0-66405";"At least tell us where to find Otumi-Ra."
"204987124-0-66406";"Let's just find him first and then we can sort it all out."
"204987124-0-66408";"You're lucky to be leaving this place alive, whoever claims you."
"204987124-0-66409";"You're lucky to be leaving this place alive, whoever claims you."
"204987124-0-66410";"Yes, we came about Satul-Sa. Wake up!"
"204987124-0-66414";"I'll go warn the councilors, then meet you at Jirich's manor."
"204987124-0-66418";"You never learned anything else about it?"
"204987124-0-66421";"All right, we'll go to the chapel and look for your armor."
"204987124-0-66422";"How many fermented mudcrab apples do you need?"
"204987124-0-66423";"How many fermented mudcrab apples do you need?"
"204987124-0-66424";"You mentioned needing a ticket."
"204987124-0-66426";"Sounds good. Where do we find them?"
"204987124-0-66431";"Tell me more about this spell."
"204987124-0-66433";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-66435";"A warlord named Naxhosa raids the village and kills its people. They need your help."
"204987124-0-66436";"All right, I'll ignite the lantern again."
"204987124-0-66439";"Lead on."
"204987124-0-66441";"You wish to challenge me to drink alcohol?"
"204987124-0-66444";"Does anyone else believe your grandmother's stories?"
"204987124-0-66445";"Let's do this."
"204987124-0-66448";"Calia almost burned down the temple. But Sombren knows someone who can help her."
"204987124-0-66450";"Sombren's mentor. We're going to meet outside Gideon. We might be gone for a while."
"204987124-0-66452";"So you don't serve Mehrunes Dagon?"
"204987124-0-66453";"What are you doing in the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-66454";"Good. That's two of the three remaining Winds. Hopefully that is enough."
"204987124-0-66456";"That's right. How did you know?"
"204987124-0-66457";"Take the passage to the south. And be careful."
"204987124-0-66459";"Tell me about Phalevon's armor."
"204987124-0-66460";"So where did these Minotaurs come from?"
"204987124-0-66461";"Why did the Nibenese build the mausoleum here?"
"204987124-0-66462";"I'm curious about these relics we're after."
"204987124-0-66463";"You mentioned Goblins and Minotaurs?"
"204987124-0-66464";"You mentioned Goblins and Minotaurs?"
"204987124-0-66467";"This ritual had better free Yisara too."
"204987124-0-66468";"What are you getting at?"
"204987124-0-66469";"I'll join them. When do we start?"
"204987124-0-66471";"And you think that secret is dangerous?"
"204987124-0-66472";"Why do you care? I thought all Daedra were evil."
"204987124-0-66473";"Why are you after an Imperial cache?"
"204987124-0-66474";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-66475";"I'll get the kit and find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-66476";"I'll get the kit and find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-66477";"I'll get the kit and find <<1>>."
"204987124-0-66479";"That's pretty high up. Can you get up there?"
"204987124-0-66480";"I'll get it open."
"204987124-0-66481";"I can help. Get ready."
"204987124-0-66483";"Don't Daedra just dissipate when they die?"
"204987124-0-66484";"Why would Xynaa drain your power and toss you down here?"
"204987124-0-66485";"She unleashed their power without teaching them to control it? Won't that consume them?"
"204987124-0-66486";"Who was this old foe of Xynaa's?"
"204987124-0-66487";"What are you doing?"
"204987124-0-66488";"How can we stop them?"
"204987124-0-66491";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-66494";"So you don't mind that she's looking into the secrets of the Longhouse Emperors?"
"204987124-0-66496";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-66500";"Tell me more about the book you were sent to retrieve from Black Drake Villa."
"204987124-0-66501";"Why didn't you deliver the book as soon as you retrieved it?"
"204987124-0-66502";"When did you realize?"
"204987124-0-66503";"I thought you wanted to transplant it."
"204987124-0-66505";"It sounds to me like this might be beyond your abilities after all."
"204987124-0-66507";"All right. We'll see what happens."
"204987124-0-66508";"Did you show your brother the book? Maybe he can translate it."
"204987124-0-66509";"Take your time. Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-66510";"What do you know about this device?"
"204987124-0-66514";"Hello? What's great?"
"204987124-0-66517";"Are you willing to give the seeds up to save her?"
"204987124-0-66518";"What are the chances that this goes wrong?"
"204987124-0-66524";"That's interesting, but it doesn't really help us at the moment."
"204987124-0-66527";"Why did some of you stay behind?"
"204987124-0-66529";"What will happen when he reaches this lode?"
"204987124-0-66530";"Thank you, lieutenant."
"204987124-0-66532";"Why do you want the seed?"
"204987124-0-66533";"Wild Elves?"
"204987124-0-66534";"What about the researcher?"
"204987124-0-66535";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-66540";"Do all Blackfeather Court crows talk?"
"204987124-0-66541";"What you're seeing is your own reflection."
"204987124-0-66545";"I could smash the mirrors."
"204987124-0-66548";"You're going to help?"
"204987124-0-66549";"Can we destroy it?"
"204987124-0-66550";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-66551";"Is growing a plant from the Deadlands a good idea?"
"204987124-0-66552";"Why do you want the seed?"
"204987124-0-66553";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-66554";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-66555";"Why are they so hostile?"
"204987124-0-66556";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-66557";"Is Old Deathwart a singing frog too?"
"204987124-0-66558";"How many adventurers have you hired for this work?"
"204987124-0-66559";"Why did the challengers bring tokens to the fight?"
"204987124-0-66560";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-66561";"I'm not sure I know how to sanctify something."
"204987124-0-66562";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-66563";"Do you know where that is?"
"204987124-0-66567";"All right, we'll keep searching then."
"204987124-0-66568";"Where can I find the captives?"
"204987124-0-66571";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-66572";"So you want me to smash the mirror?"
"204987124-0-66573";"Where will you go?"
"204987124-0-66574";"So, what's the connection to Vandacia?"
"204987124-0-66575";"And what am I going to find here?"
"204987124-0-66578";"Tell me about your pupil, Tiras."
"204987124-0-66579";"Can you tell me more about the Phantasmal Censer?"
"204987124-0-66581";"You're here to study with Revus though, right?"
"204987124-0-66582";"How should I use this?"
"204987124-0-66583";"You're not coming?"
"204987124-0-66584";"Those seeds are more valuable than the life of a stranger."
"204987124-0-66586";"Have you had difficulties with this sort of thing in the past?"
"204987124-0-66588";"What else do you know about Farrul Lupus?"
"204987124-0-66589";"Thank you, Elossi."
"204987124-0-66591";"Thank you, commander."
"204987124-0-66597";"You think it's safe for Calia and Destron to use their powers at all?"
"204987124-0-66599";"And how are you doing with your power? Still in control?"
"204987124-0-66600";"What role will the Ivory Brigade play in Fort Redmane's defense?"
"204987124-0-66601";"What about outside the fort?"
"204987124-0-66605";"Can you tell me why you can't access it?"
"204987124-0-66606";"What are you doing here, Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-66610";"Do you really think making the Phantasmal Censer work will change their opinion of you?"
"204987124-0-66612";"I'll look after the Ambitions."
"204987124-0-66613";"What do we know about the Ambitions' power?"
"204987124-0-66614";"How are you going to help Keshu and her spymaster?"
"204987124-0-66615";"Revus told us to investigate."
"204987124-0-66618";"So, how do we find him?"
"204987124-0-66620";"Can you let me out?"
"204987124-0-66621";"All right, let's find Tiras and this lode you mentioned."
"204987124-0-66622";"You mentioned a Keywright's Gallery. What is that place?"
"204987124-0-66623";"Sure. But I have some questions."
"204987124-0-66624";"All right, we'll head there next. What can we expect to encounter in the Gallery?"
"204987124-0-66625";"Why does it worry you?"
"204987124-0-66626";"Where can we find a replacement skyshard?"
"204987124-0-66627";"What are skyshards, exactly?"
"204987124-0-66629";"What do you think I should do next?"
"204987124-0-66631";"Do you really think fate brought me here?"
"204987124-0-66635";"Do you think Tiras's letter will solidify your position in the House?"
"204987124-0-66637";"What will the twins learn from these obelisks?"
"204987124-0-66639";"And they never explained what that purpose was?"
"204987124-0-66643";"When you mention her bleeding heart, what do you mean?"
"204987124-0-66644";"How have you been, Clever?"
"204987124-0-66647";"They gave no sign of their purpose?"
"204987124-0-66648";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-66649";"You never faced attacks before now?"
"204987124-0-66650";"Tell me more about Rockgrove."
"204987124-0-66653";"<Enter Rockgrove.>"
"204987124-0-66662";"Are you ready to see the final vision?"
"204987124-0-66665";"Your butcher knife has taken some real abuse."
"204987124-0-66666";"What about this map? I found it under her bed."
"204987124-0-66668";"I'll check it out."
"204987124-0-66670";"What did you learn about Annyce then?"
"204987124-0-66671";"How do you know that?"
"204987124-0-66673";"Let's see what we find in the marsh, then."
"204987124-0-66674";"I'll untie you. Make a run for it."
"204987124-0-66676";"Thank me later. Just run for it when I untie you."
"204987124-0-66678";"Get out of here as soon as I get you untied."
"204987124-0-66680";"And he placed all his treasures here?"
"204987124-0-66681";"A xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-66682";"Tell me more about the shrine."
"204987124-0-66684";"What kind of Argonian relic?"
"204987124-0-66686";"I'll help you set things right. What do we need to do?"
"204987124-0-66687";"Your daughter did some kind of ritual out in the marsh. You might want to watch her closely."
"204987124-0-66690";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-66692";"I can try."
"204987124-0-66693";"Trust me. None of this is real."
"204987124-0-66696";"I need to find Annyce Favraud."
"204987124-0-66698";"That journal that led you here. Did it happen to mention anything about the fate of the world?"
"204987124-0-66699";"It's not a prison. She made a deal with someone called Cres."
"204987124-0-66700";"What should we do with the dreamers?"
"204987124-0-66702";"All right."
"204987124-0-66704";"So, it's not fully assembled yet?"
"204987124-0-66705";"You mentioned she carried a sending stone?"
"204987124-0-66706";"How do they work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-66707";"You said you were poisoned? Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-66708";"Back where?"
"204987124-0-66709";"I'll discuss it with my friend."
"204987124-0-66710";"Why did you keep making these deals?"
"204987124-0-66715";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-66716";"Do you think he'll stay in Farmer's Nook?"
"204987124-0-66718";"So you'll be staying in Farmer's Nook?"
"204987124-0-66725";"So you're all right with her going off to become a pirate?"
"204987124-0-66727";"You think he'll get better?"
"204987124-0-66730";"What's it like in there?"
"204987124-0-66732";"I will. Do you have any idea why Mephala wanted Mehrunes Dagon's machine?"
"204987124-0-66734";"Yes. Set me free and I'll help."
"204987124-0-66739";"Sombren knew someone who could help them control their power, but she tried to kill us."
"204987124-0-66741";"Are you here to resolve the feud?"
"204987124-0-66743";"Do you know where the others were taken?"
"204987124-0-66744";"Let's keep moving then."
"204987124-0-66747";"If Larz-Tul agrees that your debt is paid, what's next for you?"
"204987124-0-66749";"Why don't you just use the amulet yourself? Why do you need me?"
"204987124-0-66750";"Are you going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-66751";"You found your romantic muse in a crumbling castle?"
"204987124-0-66752";"I'll help you with your investigation."
"204987124-0-66754";"Eveli is your sister?"
"204987124-0-66755";"You must have some idea what it is to have such a strong reaction."
"204987124-0-66757";"What do you know about Leyawiin?"
"204987124-0-66758";"And Lyranth believes all of this concerns the fate of our world."
"204987124-0-66759";"Will you be all right hanging on to that strange book?"
"204987124-0-66762";"You translated the carvings? What do they say?"
"204987124-0-66763";"Does it say how we stop the sorcerer and break the curse?"
"204987124-0-66765";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-66766";"The duplicates have a purpose?"
"204987124-0-66767";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-66768";"Duchess Astella and Mathen seemed peaceful enough."
"204987124-0-66770";"Can we choose who to summon with the lantern?"
"204987124-0-66771";"Tell me more about the Sul-Xan."
"204987124-0-66772";"What is the Idol of Xulunaht?"
"204987124-0-66773";"How am I supposed to get them across the water if they don't want to go?"
"204987124-0-66775";"Why is it called the Keywright's Gallery?"
"204987124-0-66776";"Can you describe the Daedra, Shyazzel?"
"204987124-0-66777";"Why were you studying this place?"
"204987124-0-66779";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-66780";"How did you escape?"
"204987124-0-66785";"That's the trick to it?"
"204987124-0-66788";"What can you tell me about Alchemy?"
"204987124-0-66790";"When you mention her bleeding heart, what do you mean?"
"204987124-0-66791";"Have you been drinking?"
"204987124-0-66794";"So it's like a theater."
"204987124-0-66795";"What brings your troupe to such a remote, little town?"
"204987124-0-66796";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-66797";"Are you concerned about appearances?"
"204987124-0-66800";"Will you tell your family about Alizinda?"
"204987124-0-66801";"This all happened fairly quickly. Did you really feel something for Mathen?"
"204987124-0-66802";"But this was something more?"
"204987124-0-66803";"You mentioned a Keywright's Gallery. What is that place?"
"204987124-0-66804";"You said something about golems. What's going on here, exactly?"
"204987124-0-66807";"If the ward is in place, why are you concerned about the cultists reaching the cache first?"
"204987124-0-66809";"What made you decide to leave?"
"204987124-0-66810";"What can you tell me about Doombringer Eshil?"
"204987124-0-66811";"I thought whatever Xynaa did to you has made your power manageable again."
"204987124-0-66814";"Or what?"
"204987124-0-66817";"Eveli knows someone in Elden Root who can decipher the code."
"204987124-0-66819";"Extended family? How many siblings do you have?"
"204987124-0-66820";"What else do you know about Farrul Lupus?"
"204987124-0-66821";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-66822";"Will dealing with Shyazzel pacify the golems?"
"204987124-0-66823";"Maybe you'll see him again."
"204987124-0-66825";"Like?"
"204987124-0-66827";"What if she meets a living man and …?"
"204987124-0-66829";"And have you forgiven Sombren for what happened in the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-66831";"All right, let's find that skyshard. Can I ask you something before we set out?"
"204987124-0-66832";"What kind of golem did you see near the skyshard?"
"204987124-0-66833";"What are skyshards, exactly?"
"204987124-0-66836";"Leovic's notes also listed other people besides Farrul Lupus who know about the secret."
"204987124-0-66837";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-66845";"And keep them out of Vandacia's hands."
"204987124-0-66848";"Why?"
"204987124-0-66849";"Why are tensions so high between your tribe and the Imperials?"
"204987124-0-66850";"What else could be taking your people?"
"204987124-0-66851";"What do you know about Black Drake Villa?"
"204987124-0-66852";"What do you know of Black Drake Villa?"
"204987124-0-66853";"Who was that massive Minotaur?"
"204987124-0-66854";"What's the Grand Archive?"
"204987124-0-66855";"What role will the Ivory Brigade play in Fort Redmane's defense?"
"204987124-0-66856";"We can't lose the Ambitions to Vandacia. No matter what."
"204987124-0-66857";"You want to go after her too?"
"204987124-0-66860";"Tell me about this ruin."
"204987124-0-66867";"I'm ready when you are."
"204987124-0-66870";"How is that possible?"
"204987124-0-66875";"What about you?"
"204987124-0-66876";"You mentioned a Grand Archive?"
"204987124-0-66877";"They might be useful in the future."
"204987124-0-66879";"How do you know it's a journal?"
"204987124-0-66880";"Who do you think the True-Sworn work for?"
"204987124-0-66881";"Who do you think these people are?"
"204987124-0-66883";"Councilor Jirich!"
"204987124-0-66890";"Who is this Flame-Herald Bahsei you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-66892";"How is your tribe connected to the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-66893";"What do you know about the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-66894";"Why did it ask this of you?"
"204987124-0-66895";"Captain Rian sent me to find the councilor. He thinks she might be in danger."
"204987124-0-66904";"You drifted apart?"
"204987124-0-66905";"Was the swimming hole the last place you saw her?"
"204987124-0-66906";"Did you find anything?"
"204987124-0-66907";"Was the swimming hole the last place you saw her?"
"204987124-0-66908";"You think it could have been her ghost?"
"204987124-0-66909";"And Shyazzel? What brought it here?"
"204987124-0-66910";"Yes, I would like to travel to alliance territory."
"204987124-0-66911";"On second thought, I might want to travel outside the borders of the three great alliances."
"204987124-0-66912";"Where else could I find adventure?"
"204987124-0-66913";"Did anything unusual occur before Igmund went missing?"
"204987124-0-66914";"How so?"
"204987124-0-66915";"I heard Igmund went missing for a little while."
"204987124-0-66916";"Any idea why he was so talkative?"
"204987124-0-66917";"Who was Bugtail to you?"
"204987124-0-66918";"And how are things in the Orc city?"
"204987124-0-66919";"Remind me about the secret."
"204987124-0-66921";"I'll go warn the councilors, then meet you at Jirich's manor."
"204987124-0-66922";"I found a letter to Councilor Jirich from Farrul Lupus. It warned her that she was in danger."
"204987124-0-66929";"But you just learned about the threat to the councilors?"
"204987124-0-66930";"The Imperial Elder Council?"
"204987124-0-66935";"We last met in Elsweyr, how did you end up in Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-66936";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-66937";"What can you tell me about this bookkeeper?"
"204987124-0-66938";"What can you tell me about this bookkeeper?"
"204987124-0-66940";"Sounds good to me."
"204987124-0-66941";"Why are you with a different tribe?"
"204987124-0-66942";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-66943";"Who were you arguing with just now?"
"204987124-0-66944";"Did they threaten you?"
"204987124-0-66945";"You mentioned two … morsels. What's the other?"
"204987124-0-66946";"How will Pungent Adder know these slights are from us?"
"204987124-0-66947";"Who were you arguing with just now?"
"204987124-0-66948";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-66949";"What should I use to taint Pungent Adder's wine?"
"204987124-0-66950";"What should I do with the orders I find in the dead drops?"
"204987124-0-66951";"Any idea who she may have met here?"
"204987124-0-66954";"I'll buy one."
"204987124-0-66958";"Then what should we do?"
"204987124-0-66959";"How did you end up in Blackwood? That's quite a distance from where we last met."
"204987124-0-66961";"Good luck, wherever you go."
"204987124-0-66963";"How did you end up in Blackwood? That's quite a distance from where we last met."
"204987124-0-66964";"A traitor? I haven't heard of him."
"204987124-0-66965";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-66966";"So you and Quistley are like brothers?"
"204987124-0-66968";"What does this cult want with the Blackfeather Court?"
"204987124-0-66969";"Do you have any ideas about how to restore your company?"
"204987124-0-66972";"Did you see anything about a chamber called the Fane of Scorn?"
"204987124-0-66973";"How much of a debt does Quistley Silvelle owe this Larz-Tul?"
"204987124-0-66979";"How do I know you won't attack us?"
"204987124-0-66980";"Can you tell me anything else about the curse?"
"204987124-0-66981";"How do I get to the shrine?"
"204987124-0-66984";"Maybe she really is just running away?"
"204987124-0-66985";"Three? But Meer-Ta isn't here."
"204987124-0-66987";"But somehow they were able to kill Satul-Sa."
"204987124-0-66989";"Then let us make our way inside."
"204987124-0-66990";"Do you think this was the only one?"
"204987124-0-66994";"You're saying this is new construction?"
"204987124-0-66995";"Are you going to be all right? You don't look so good."
"204987124-0-66996";"Are you all right? You don't look so good."
"204987124-0-66997";"And the people blamed your grandmother for her death?"
"204987124-0-66998";"You said you're not from around here. Where did you travel from?"
"204987124-0-66999";"Your grandmother disappeared?"
"204987124-0-67000";"Is it that important? Why come all this way to solve a sixty year-old crime?"
"204987124-0-67001";"Tell me more about this murder."
"204987124-0-67002";"So, you think clearing Cerise's name will earn you an apology?"
"204987124-0-67003";"What is this crime you've come to investigate?"
"204987124-0-67005";"I've seen memory stones before. I knew an Elf in Balmora who asked me to use one."
"204987124-0-67006";"So, you believe that if this memory stone holds memories made here, it will activate?"
"204987124-0-67007";"So, you believe that if this memory stone holds memories made here, it will activate?"
"204987124-0-67008";"Can you give me the details of the crime again?"
"204987124-0-67013";"Where did you leave the imposter?"
"204987124-0-67014";"How did your grandmother acquire something that valuable?"
"204987124-0-67015";"What is this crime you've come to investigate?"
"204987124-0-67018";"Thanks for the tip."
"204987124-0-67019";"Will destroying the idol prevent the Sul-Xan from doing this again?"
"204987124-0-67020";"You said your grandmother was Rolaine's assistant. Did she know these novitiates?"
"204987124-0-67021";"Dark turn? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-67023";"All right. Let's see if the stone resonates anywhere else in the Dibellaseum."
"204987124-0-67025";"Do you know where Sombren and Calia went when they left the temple?"
"204987124-0-67028";"I spoke with the spirits of your apprentices. They showed me how to close the gate."
"204987124-0-67030";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-67031";"What will you do if you stay?"
"204987124-0-67032";"So it doesn't have to be dreams?"
"204987124-0-67033";"Of all the places you could have chosen, why Farmer's Nook?"
"204987124-0-67034";"You have an alternative?"
"204987124-0-67035";"Can't you just tell me what happened to Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-67036";"Do you know why they were trying to sacrifice you?"
"204987124-0-67038";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-67039";"Did you learn something that we might find helpful?"
"204987124-0-67041";"What do you mean, the real Xigira?"
"204987124-0-67042";"Do you know where she took him?"
"204987124-0-67045";"Can't you just tell me what happened to Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-67048";"Yes. Or they intended to. To a group of mages called the Ideal Masters."
"204987124-0-67049";"If no one ever recovered Priestess Rolaine's body, how was your grandmother convicted of her murder?"
"204987124-0-67050";"It points to a location in the swamps. Far east of Gideon."
"204987124-0-67051";"They had no one to blame for the murder and needed a scapegoat."
"204987124-0-67052";"Who are these Ideal Masters?"
"204987124-0-67053";"The Waking Flame worship Mehrunes Dagon, but I've heard nothing about them capturing souls."
"204987124-0-67054";"If no one ever recovered Governor Rolaine's body, how was your grandfather convicted of his murder?"
"204987124-0-67055";"Maybe they're the ones that stirred up the threats against you. To keep you off the scent."
"204987124-0-67056";"Are you sure your grandmother wasn't just making up a story?"
"204987124-0-67057";"I also found black soul gems in the chest. Three of them."
"204987124-0-67058";"If she's the killer, why is she dead and why is your grandmother missing?"
"204987124-0-67060";"What?"
"204987124-0-67062";"I take it you like your new life so far."
"204987124-0-67064";"Good luck in the House of Reveries."
"204987124-0-67065";"Where is this ring?"
"204987124-0-67066";"How will you do that?"
"204987124-0-67070";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-67072";"Your father withheld information about his family from Bastian?"
"204987124-0-67074";"Very well. We'll go to Illessan Tower and find the ring."
"204987124-0-67075";"What do you remember about your mother?"
"204987124-0-67078";"Let's get going."
"204987124-0-67079";"And you think it's your grandmother?"
"204987124-0-67080";"Maybe I could deliver the news—to someone other than the Dibellites."
"204987124-0-67082";"All right. Let's go speak with Fire-From-Nowhere, then."
"204987124-0-67083";"Understood. Let's go."
"204987124-0-67084";"I have evidence that proves Priestess Rolaine was a necromancer and serial killer."
"204987124-0-67085";"It is. Cerise did kill Rolaine, but only to save others. Faric holds all the proof you'll need."
"204987124-0-67087";"Thank you, captain."
"204987124-0-67088";"Understood."
"204987124-0-67089";"What did the Silvelles tell you?"
"204987124-0-67090";"Let's get going."
"204987124-0-67094";"Will you tell your family about Alizinda?"
"204987124-0-67096";"What are you basing that on?"
"204987124-0-67097";"Do you think your mother made it to Aetherius?"
"204987124-0-67099";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-67100";"What are you hoping to learn from this letter?"
"204987124-0-67102";"Let's see if we can find that ring in Illessan Tower."
"204987124-0-67103";"Here's the ring."
"204987124-0-67105";"Do you know anything more about why your parents took in Bastian?"
"204987124-0-67115";"What about the warlord Naxhosa?"
"204987124-0-67116";"Tell me about the Four Winds."
"204987124-0-67124";"What brings you to Blackwood?"
"204987124-0-67125";"The Longhouse Emperors?"
"204987124-0-67126";"Another realm?"
"204987124-0-67127";"You said you were poisoned? Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-67128";"Didn't you say your sister was dead?"
"204987124-0-67130";"I'll go with you."
"204987124-0-67131";"Do you know where she went? We need to find her."
"204987124-0-67133";"He was told that his sister had died."
"204987124-0-67134";"No, the Silvelles took him in and raised him."
"204987124-0-67135";"Why did you bring Bastian to the Silvelles instead of going straight to Wayrest?"
"204987124-0-67136";"Tell me more about this Minotaur."
"204987124-0-67138";"Cake is all you want for a reward?"
"204987124-0-67141";"What about your sister?"
"204987124-0-67143";"You know that talking to your sister may be the only way to get the answers you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-67145";"Maybe they're the ones that stirred up the threats against you. To keep you off the scent."
"204987124-0-67146";"How so?"
"204987124-0-67150";"Tell me more about this Wood Elf archer and the Imperial secrets."
"204987124-0-67151";"You think the Dark Brotherhood harmed Councilor Jirich?"
"204987124-0-67152";"I'll help find Councilor Jirich."
"204987124-0-67155";"She marked it on my map. Said it was north of the city."
"204987124-0-67158";"Is it dangerous?"
"204987124-0-67159";"Do you have any more information about the portals?"
"204987124-0-67161";"Do you have a theory about Mehrunes Dagon's plan?"
"204987124-0-67162";"I'm not exactly sure, but the host of the event is Councilor Vandacia."
"204987124-0-67163";"Where did it go wrong?"
"204987124-0-67167";"Arrange something? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-67168";"What can you tell me about this bookkeeper?"
"204987124-0-67169";"Councilor Faleria told me Jirich kept records in a hidden compartment in her nightstand."
"204987124-0-67171";"I have other questions."
"204987124-0-67172";"Is Old Deathwart a singing frog too?"
"204987124-0-67173";"So what are you planning to do?"
"204987124-0-67174";"How do I use the grapple bow you gave me?"
"204987124-0-67176";"But the Deadlands. You'll be walking right into Mehrunes Dagon's realm."
"204987124-0-67177";"Abor's meal was still warm but untouched, and the assassin left a calling card."
"204987124-0-67180";"How many adventurers have you hired?"
"204987124-0-67181";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-67183";"What can you tell me about Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-67184";"You mentioned Elves, too. Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-67185";"Is there work to do on Summerset Isle?"
"204987124-0-67186";"What's happening in Western Skyrim?"
"204987124-0-67187";"What can you tell me about Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-67188";"What can you tell me about Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-67189";"You mentioned Elves, too. Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-67190";"You mentioned Elves, too. Where can I find them?"
"204987124-0-67191";"I guess we'll never know."
"204987124-0-67192";"Do you plan to use any of these doors?"
"204987124-0-67193";"Do you think you'll ever unravel the mysteries of this place?"
"204987124-0-67196";"Who should I talk to?"
"204987124-0-67204";"The letter indicates that the entrance to the sanctuary is deep inside the cave."
"204987124-0-67206";"I'll go with you to Bloodrun Cave to investigate the sanctuary."
"204987124-0-67208";"Wouldn't your sister have tried to find you after your mother died?"
"204987124-0-67211";"Do you think he'll meet with you?"
"204987124-0-67212";"I hope you find answers."
"204987124-0-67213";"I hope you find answers."
"204987124-0-67214";"We still need to find the fourth Ambition, I suppose."
"204987124-0-67215";"Take care of yourself, Eveli."
"204987124-0-67217";"I'm here on behalf of Bastian Hallix. He is looking for his sister."
"204987124-0-67219";"You told her Bastian was dead?"
"204987124-0-67220";"I was with Eveli when we found the steward's body."
"204987124-0-67221";"Do we know an expert?"
"204987124-0-67222";"I'll go with you to Gideon to talk to Governor Keshu."
"204987124-0-67225";"We'll go to Koeglin Mine and find Clairene."
"204987124-0-67226";"Count Auzin said the slavers are in Koeglin Mine."
"204987124-0-67227";"To Koeglin Mine, then."
"204987124-0-67229";"You probably should think about what to say to your sister."
"204987124-0-67232";"Do you think you'll stay in Wayrest?"
"204987124-0-67233";"First things first: Koeglin Mine."
"204987124-0-67235";"All the more reason to stop these rituals."
"204987124-0-67242";"Anything else before we go?"
"204987124-0-67246";"If not the Dark Brotherhood, then who's been murdering the councilors?"
"204987124-0-67249";"Look out!"
"204987124-0-67251";"Did the Silvelles mistreat you?"
"204987124-0-67253";"What else can you tell me about Councilor Jirich?"
"204987124-0-67254";"Ongoing war?"
"204987124-0-67255";"I feel fine."
"204987124-0-67257";"Where's Eveli now?"
"204987124-0-67258";"Where's Eveli now?"
"204987124-0-67260";"You have a countess but the legates are in charge?"
"204987124-0-67261";"Tell me more about the situation here in Leyawiin."
"204987124-0-67262";"My companion is Bastian Hallix."
"204987124-0-67264";"He'd been told that you were dead, too."
"204987124-0-67265";"I'll let the two of you speak."
"204987124-0-67266";"Should we follow the voice?"
"204987124-0-67269";"You're sure you don't want to do this yourself? You created the censer in the first place."
"204987124-0-67271";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-67272";"I'll go talk to the Ambitions."
"204987124-0-67278";"Tell me more about the strange book you found."
"204987124-0-67279";"So why is the Dark Brotherhood murdering the councilors?"
"204987124-0-67280";"Should I take the Ambitions to Fort Redmane?"
"204987124-0-67282";"I'll speak to the Ambitions and then find allies to defend Fort Redmane."
"204987124-0-67284";"She certainly seems willing to treat you as family."
"204987124-0-67286";"Do you want to stay in Wayrest with her?"
"204987124-0-67287";"Tell me more about the strange book you found."
"204987124-0-67294";"Do you know what Vandacia is going to reveal at this event?"
"204987124-0-67296";"Do you think he did it? Found an Ambition, I mean?"
"204987124-0-67299";"I suppose there's still the Ambitions to deal with."
"204987124-0-67301";"The Deadlands? Mehrunes Dagon is sure to find you there!"
"204987124-0-67302";"The work you started?"
"204987124-0-67305";"What happened to him?"
"204987124-0-67306";"Tell me more about this Golden Anvil we are searching for."
"204987124-0-67307";"There was a rope hanging from the ceiling of the watchtower."
"204987124-0-67308";"Councilor Vandacia is a traitor. He's the high priest of the Order of the Waking Flame."
"204987124-0-67312";"Tell me about the premonition."
"204987124-0-67313";"What did the figure look like?"
"204987124-0-67314";"How long did you serve on the Imperial Elder Council?"
"204987124-0-67317";"All right. Let's keep searching for Tiras."
"204987124-0-67323";"What will you do if it is there?"
"204987124-0-67324";"Anything from Ralos's journal jump out at you?"
"204987124-0-67325";"What do you make of this letter Quentin left behind?"
"204987124-0-67326";"Anything from Ralos's journal jump out at you?"
"204987124-0-67327";"What do you make of this letter Quentin left behind?"
"204987124-0-67329";"Who are the Knights of Iron?"
"204987124-0-67332";"Fair point."
"204987124-0-67333";"Ojel-bak?"
"204987124-0-67334";"I'll go talk to Councilor Lovidicus now."
"204987124-0-67335";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-67337";"Will you share these lessons with your kinsfolk in the House?"
"204987124-0-67338";"As you wish. But if you know something that can help us stop Vandacia, I hope you share it."
"204987124-0-67341";"But you came here to try and fix things anyway?"
"204987124-0-67343";"All right, I'll try to determine who made these murders look like the work of the Dark Brotherhood."
"204987124-0-67344";"Who would want to blame the Dark Brotherhood for these murders?"
"204987124-0-67346";"Can you tell me anything more about what I'm looking for?"
"204987124-0-67347";"What do you want from me?"
"204987124-0-67349";"I'll see if the Dark Elf left any clues behind. And I'll help you rescue Quistley."
"204987124-0-67350";"Are you a member of the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-67351";"Can you tell me anything more about what I'm looking for?"
"204987124-0-67354";"Why would the Imperials take your people?"
"204987124-0-67355";"Heem-Jas seems to want to figure that out."
"204987124-0-67357";"The Order of the Waking Flame."
"204987124-0-67359";"No. He was being held in a keep in the Deadlands."
"204987124-0-67366";"And you can use that energy to recharge your power?"
"204987124-0-67367";"Who was this old foe of Xynaa's?"
"204987124-0-67369";"Are you sure you can't tell me why you're involved in the Morag Tong's affairs?"
"204987124-0-67371";"What sorts of things do you need done?"
"204987124-0-67372";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-67376";"Are there any specific areas of the ruin you'd like notes on?"
"204987124-0-67380";"I wish you luck, Heem-Jas."
"204987124-0-67382";"She cheated you?"
"204987124-0-67384";"I really need to find Irenni."
"204987124-0-67385";"Do you think she might really be in jail?"
"204987124-0-67387";"Let's pay a visit to the bank."
"204987124-0-67388";"Right. So tell me about your meeting with Irenni Elendis."
"204987124-0-67391";"Do you think she'll really give it up this time?"
"204987124-0-67393";"Should we make sure your mother returns home safely?"
"204987124-0-67395";"If it was so important to you, why did you wager it?"
"204987124-0-67399";"You can hardly blame my people for being wary of Dark Elves."
"204987124-0-67400";"I take it this isn't the first time you've had to go chasing after your mother."
"204987124-0-67401";"Did your family keep slaves?"
"204987124-0-67402";"Did your family keep slaves?"
"204987124-0-67406";"What's next for the Ivory Brigade?"
"204987124-0-67407";"Who else is attending Keshu's celebration?"
"204987124-0-67408";"I can try."
"204987124-0-67409";"What are the Four Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-67410";"And are the councilors safe?"
"204987124-0-67411";"And do you believe them?"
"204987124-0-67412";"Edvilda planned to send Irenni to the Inner Sea Armature, which is full of bandits."
"204987124-0-67414";"Then let's head to the Inner Sea Armature and look for her."
"204987124-0-67417";"Have you learned much about Zenithar?"
"204987124-0-67418";"What happened to the relic you broke?"
"204987124-0-67419";"What about the feeling that drew you here? Have you learned anything about that?"
"204987124-0-67421";"What have you heard so far?"
"204987124-0-67423";"Sounds impressive."
"204987124-0-67424";"Did things work out?"
"204987124-0-67427";"So, you're headed back to Morrowind?"
"204987124-0-67428";"So, you really did have a change of heart?"
"204987124-0-67429";"Anything I can do?"
"204987124-0-67430";"I saw more souls rise up when the Sul-Xan killed some captives."
"204987124-0-67431";"Considering retiring?"
"204987124-0-67432";"No promises."
"204987124-0-67433";"Why would they kill an Argonian priest?"
"204987124-0-67434";"I'd like to know more about your students."
"204987124-0-67435";"And Manasha?"
"204987124-0-67436";"Can you tell me more about this tome?"
"204987124-0-67437";"Then how was it written?"
"204987124-0-67438";"So you'll be returning?"
"204987124-0-67439";"You mentioned the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-67440";"And the Golden Anvil?"
"204987124-0-67441";"Is performing last rites on Nesh-Tei the job of a voh-vastei?"
"204987124-0-67444";"You mentioned the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-67447";"Actually, the celebration is for our victory at Fort Redmane and the saving of Blackwood."
"204987124-0-67455";"I faced you before. How do I know this isn't another plot?"
"204987124-0-67456";"Do you know where they took it?"
"204987124-0-67457";"What should I do if I find him?"
"204987124-0-67458";"How do you know Tumma-Maxath?"
"204987124-0-67459";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-67461";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-67462";"I guess you have your hands full."
"204987124-0-67463";"So you are enjoying being an actor?"
"204987124-0-67467";"Tumma-Maxath is dead."
"204987124-0-67469";"Why are you working for Tumma-Maxath?"
"204987124-0-67470";"I know you stole the Shade Sickle."
"204987124-0-67471";"I was able to convince both of them to choose a new life."
"204987124-0-67472";"I was able to convince both of them to choose a new life."
"204987124-0-67473";"So, do you think this will be enough to repair your standing with Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-67474";"So, do you think this will be enough to repair your standing with Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-67475";"So, do you think this will be enough to repair your standing with Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-67476";"So, do you think this will be enough to repair your standing with Nocturnal?"
"204987124-0-67478";"All right, I'll track down Giovanni and follow him to the meeting."
"204987124-0-67484";"Can you tell me a bit about Keshu?"
"204987124-0-67488";"You sound proud of her."
"204987124-0-67496";"Why does Tee-Wan want to meet in a graveyard?"
"204987124-0-67497";"What would you have been patrolling for?"
"204987124-0-67498";"Doesn't that mean you all could suffer instead?"
"204987124-0-67500";"Can you accept help?"
"204987124-0-67501";"Can you tell me more about Tee-Wan?"
"204987124-0-67502";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-67503";"What's the Black Fin Legion?"
"204987124-0-67504";"Where is Melyn Drad?"
"204987124-0-67505";"Is Xocin part of that group?"
"204987124-0-67506";"If you're that close, do you really not have any idea where he might be?"
"204987124-0-67507";"Black Fin?"
"204987124-0-67508";"What's the Black Fin Legion?"
"204987124-0-67509";"Does Keshu know about what's going on with Xocin?"
"204987124-0-67510";"What makes you think he'll talk to me?"
"204987124-0-67511";"What's the Black Fin Legion?"
"204987124-0-67512";"What do you think is going on?"
"204987124-0-67514";"Was that someone Xocin?"
"204987124-0-67515";"Tell me more about the ritual stone."
"204987124-0-67516";"What did Xocin want from you?"
"204987124-0-67517";"Are you saying Xocin fell in love with one of his conjured servants?"
"204987124-0-67518";"Tell me more about the ritual stone."
"204987124-0-67519";"A ritual stone. He mentioned something about Xocin being in love."
"204987124-0-67520";"Who's Xyria?"
"204987124-0-67522";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-67523";"What are you saying?"
"204987124-0-67524";"What should I do when I find Xocin?"
"204987124-0-67525";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-67526";"Anything you can tell me about Doomvault Porcixid?"
"204987124-0-67527";"What should I do when I find Xocin?"
"204987124-0-67528";"Can Xocin really bring Xyria back?"
"204987124-0-67530";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-67531";"Anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-67533";"Why harrowing?"
"204987124-0-67534";"Eveli and I will head out immediately."
"204987124-0-67535";"What harm do they do?"
"204987124-0-67536";"What else can you tell us about the Sul-Xan?"
"204987124-0-67537";"How did you wind up in Gideon?"
"204987124-0-67538";"Are you saying that Imperials destroy nature?"
"204987124-0-67540";"Are you saying we destroy nature?"
"204987124-0-67541";"What sorts of things do you need done?"
"204987124-0-67546";"Why didn't Vandacia try to kill you, too?"
"204987124-0-67551";"I didn't say that."
"204987124-0-67552";"That's not a good idea."
"204987124-0-67553";"Please don't."
"204987124-0-67554";"I'm not sure that's what's going to kill you, but sure."
"204987124-0-67557";"Does it involve putting yourself in more danger?"
"204987124-0-67560";"Please stop."
"204987124-0-67562";"We can't tempt you to come with us to find the vault?"
"204987124-0-67563";"Why didn't Vandacia try to kill you, too?"
"204987124-0-67565";"Do you think you'll be able to do it?"
"204987124-0-67569";"Has your opinion of these Imperials changed?"
"204987124-0-67570";"Why is this puzzle box so important to you?"
"204987124-0-67573";"Won't they be in danger of destroying themselves, though?"
"204987124-0-67574";"What do the rest of your soldiers think?"
"204987124-0-67577";"Mehrunes Dagon said you would join him or die. We need to make sure neither of those things happen."
"204987124-0-67578";"Did you find the ritual stone?"
"204987124-0-67579";"How am I supposed to recharge the stone?"
"204987124-0-67580";"We need to get you out of here."
"204987124-0-67581";"What are these trees?"
"204987124-0-67582";"What happened when you tried to summon Xyria?"
"204987124-0-67583";"Is this some kind of planemeld? It feels like we're in Oblivion."
"204987124-0-67584";"How am I supposed to recharge the stone?"
"204987124-0-67585";"Wouldn't your mother have already explored that option?"
"204987124-0-67587";"Why is she going through such great lengths to find it for him then?"
"204987124-0-67589";"We'll go speak with your grandfather."
"204987124-0-67591";"Irenni never gave up searching for your puzzle box, but Mirri wants to take over her mother's duty."
"204987124-0-67592";"Who did this to you?"
"204987124-0-67593";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-67594";"Why do you want the eggs destroyed?"
"204987124-0-67595";"Where can I find these eggs?"
"204987124-0-67596";"And what's that?"
"204987124-0-67599";"Maybe you can take it easy and not go anywhere."
"204987124-0-67600";"And what's that?"
"204987124-0-67601";"So you got yourself killed?"
"204987124-0-67603";"You seem happy about this."
"204987124-0-67605";"Then why did you ask?"
"204987124-0-67606";"What's the disagreement?"
"204987124-0-67607";"Let me speak with Tee-Wan and Vos before I decide."
"204987124-0-67608";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-67610";"Xocin says Xyria could be a powerful ally."
"204987124-0-67612";"What if having Xyria draws enemies to Gideon?"
"204987124-0-67614";"It's worth the risk. Summon Xyria."
"204987124-0-67616";"I'm sorry, Xocin."
"204987124-0-67617";"It appears Annyce might have run away to an old play fort in the hills near here."

"204987124-0-67622";"Important how?"
"204987124-0-67623";"Are you sure you want to keep carrying it around? We haven't seen any cultists for a while now."

"204987124-0-67626";"She's worried you're going to get yourself killed."
"204987124-0-67627";"If you don't stop thieving right now, I'll make sure Nocturnal knows your name."
"204987124-0-67629";"Do you have any leads?"
"204987124-0-67631";"Very well, let's go to Vulkhel Guard."
"204987124-0-67633";"Look out!"
"204987124-0-67634";"Why do you want these eggs saved?"
"204987124-0-67635";"Where should I look for these eggs?"
"204987124-0-67637";"Tell me more about the ritual stone."
"204987124-0-67638";"What happened to your grandfather?"
"204987124-0-67641";"So, you think clearing Cerise's name will earn you an apology?"
"204987124-0-67642";"How so?"
"204987124-0-67647";"Very well. I'll find Arelette for you."
"204987124-0-67648";"Thanks for the information."

"204987124-0-67656";"Here you go."
"204987124-0-67657";"You think the box is just a toy?"
"204987124-0-67659";"Do you think they'll reconcile?"
"204987124-0-67661";"What do you want to do now?"
"204987124-0-67662";"So you won't even try to reconcile?"
"204987124-0-67663";"You think your mother will be content with how things turned out?"
"204987124-0-67666";"Do you want some time with her?"

"204987124-0-67675";"Can you tell me anything more about the tools?"
"204987124-0-67676";"What sorts of things do you need done?"
"204987124-0-67677";"Beragon translated a portion. It mentioned the ojel-bak, but he doesn't know that word."
"204987124-0-67678";"You know someone who can help us locate the hidden vault?"
"204987124-0-67679";"It seems the village still has need of you, though."
"204987124-0-67683";"Why did the emperors lock you in here?"
"204987124-0-67684";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-67686";"How did I meet him?"
"204987124-0-67687";"Let's get going."
"204987124-0-67688";"Is there anything in particular I should know before I head out?"
"204987124-0-67689";"A traitor?"
"204987124-0-67690";"Why are you so interested in insects?"
"204987124-0-67692";"What about your mother?"
"204987124-0-67693";"The king told the Silvelles to take in Bastian?"
"204987124-0-67694";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-67695";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-67696";"What did the Silvelles tell you when they dismissed you?"

"204987124-0-67706";"All right, we'll try getting inside."
"204987124-0-67707";"You didn't think there was a connection between the lures and your missing people?"
"204987124-0-67708";"Do you care for your bride-to-be? Or is it just an alliance?"
"204987124-0-67710";"All right. Here you go."
"204987124-0-67712";"Fine, here you go."
"204987124-0-67713";"Do you care for your bride-to-be? Or is it just an alliance?"
"204987124-0-67714";"Exaggerated? You're using a letter that isn't yours to make Bastian help you."
"204987124-0-67715";"It's begging us?"
"204987124-0-67722";"A cave."
"204987124-0-67724";"Beasts and monsters."

"204987124-0-67740";"The ledger mentioned a group called the Waking Flame. Have you encountered them before?"
"204987124-0-67742";"They might be. You said you received threats. They might be trying to keep you off the scent."
"204987124-0-67743";"Cults can last a long time. They might be the ones threatening you. To scare you off the scent."
"204987124-0-67744";"Yes. They worship Mehrunes Dagon, but this is the first I've heard of them stealing souls."
"204987124-0-67745";"Her name isn't on this list. It doesn't exonerate her."

"204987124-0-67763";"Explained things? What things?"
"204987124-0-67765";"I'm here to convince the remaining Winds to join forces and remove Naxhosa."

"204987124-0-68025";"What makes you think he still has the puzzle box?"
"204987124-0-68026";"Why didn't you tell Irenni all of this?"
"204987124-0-68027";"Why didn't you tell Irenni all of this?"
"204987124-0-68028";"What are you asking?"
"204987124-0-68029";"Why didn't you go after Arelette yourself?"
"204987124-0-68030";"Can you undo the transformation?"
"204987124-0-68032";"Has your power gotten worse again?"
"204987124-0-68033";"How are you projecting your image to me?"
"204987124-0-68040";"Is everyone all right?"
"204987124-0-68042";"So we're back at square one?"
"204987124-0-68044";"That's what brought you here?"
"204987124-0-68046";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-68047";"<Enter Red Petal Bastion.>"
"204987124-0-68048";"Assist you how?"
"204987124-0-68050";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-68051";"<Enter the Dread Cellar.>"
"204987124-0-68053";"I'll help you retrieve your artifacts."
"204987124-0-68059";"I'll assist your investigation then."
"204987124-0-68065";"Tell me about Rockgrove."
"204987124-0-68066";"What is special about the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-68067";"What can you tell me about the Sul-Xan attack?"
"204987124-0-68068";"What do you want to do, Eveli?"
"204987124-0-68069";"What about those scouts you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-68072";"Questionable origin? How so?"
"204987124-0-68073";"Why do you need me to remove the wards?"
"204987124-0-68074";"But why can't you just remove the ward and open the door yourself?"
"204987124-0-68075";"Can you tell me anything about Melyn Drad?"
"204987124-0-68082";"Lyranth thinks that book is the Mysterium Xarxes. If so, it may have been written by Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-68084";"Why study Daedra if you don't really care for them?"
"204987124-0-68086";"Malosza said you were one of the guards."
"204987124-0-68088";"What can I expect from Bahsei?"
"204987124-0-68089";"How are you going to help Keshu and her spymaster?"
"204987124-0-68093";"What's next for you two?"
"204987124-0-68095";"Where are you headed next?"
"204987124-0-68096";"Why are you so interested in other people's stories? What do you have to gain?"
"204987124-0-68097";"Why are you so interested in other people's stories? What do you have to gain?"
"204987124-0-68098";"Why are you so interested in other people's stories? What do you have to gain?"
"204987124-0-68099";"Why choose me?"
"204987124-0-68100";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-68102";"Are you working with the Impresario?"
"204987124-0-68103";"Are you a nisswo?"
"204987124-0-68104";"We found Jirich's files, where you said. Lovidicus sent for a scribe to decipher the coded portions."
"204987124-0-68105";"Thank you for coming."
"204987124-0-68108";"This won't be boring."
"204987124-0-68113";"And what do we do with these slivers once we find them?"
"204987124-0-68115";"And what does that mean?"
"204987124-0-68117";"What can I expect from Bahsei?"
"204987124-0-68118";"Glad to have your troops at my side again."
"204987124-0-68123";"So how do you teach the twins to control their power?"
"204987124-0-68126";"Waking vision?"
"204987124-0-68131";"I'll just pay the cost for the outfits in gold."
"204987124-0-68134";"Remind me about the Black Fin Legion."
"204987124-0-68135";"Where should I go to look for allies?"
"204987124-0-68136";"You mentioned cult scouts. What happened to them?"
"204987124-0-68137";"Brigadine Lieutenant Viria, at Hutan-Tzel. He said that he owes me."
"204987124-0-68138";"I helped Commander Axius retake Borderwatch Garrison. He might be willing to join us."
"204987124-0-68139";"Brigadine Lieutenant Viria, at Hutan-Tzel. He said that he owes me."
"204987124-0-68140";"Brigadine Lieutenant Viria, at Hutan-Tzel. He said that he owes me."
"204987124-0-68145";"How have you been since I visited the House of Reveries?"
"204987124-0-68146";"All right. I'll head back now."
"204987124-0-68148";"You want to be lenient on them?"
"204987124-0-68150";"Making a deal with Daedra rarely leads to anything good. We need to send Cres back to Oblivion."
"204987124-0-68151";"You have an alternative?"
"204987124-0-68153";"How fare the other Winds?"
"204987124-0-68155";"Do you expect to die soon?"
"204987124-0-68161";"Mirri is clearly very protective of you."
"204987124-0-68162";"What did you overhear?"
"204987124-0-68166";"Best of luck with your future roles."
"204987124-0-68170";"Best of luck."
"204987124-0-68172";"Good luck to you and Gavos."
"204987124-0-68175";"Back to your other pursuits, then?"
"204987124-0-68177";"Are you saying your mom would have left you behind?"
"204987124-0-68178";"Did you learn anything about the cultist's plot while you were held prisoner?"
"204987124-0-68180";"I'll try to keep her out of trouble."
"204987124-0-68183";"And you mentioned a stone-talker. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-68184";"Can you tell me about Rockgrove?"
"204987124-0-68185";"How is your tribe connected to the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-68187";"Any thoughts on why Flame-Herald Bahsei needed the xanmeer?"
"204987124-0-68190";"Tell me about the work you started."
"204987124-0-68191";"What about your relationship with Leyawiin?"
"204987124-0-68193";"What are the duplicates, exactly?"
"204987124-0-68198";"What are they trying to do?"
"204987124-0-68200";"What kind of relationship did you have with their order before this?"
"204987124-0-68201";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-68202";"How do you know Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68203";"What is it you want from the priest?"
"204987124-0-68204";"What's your arrangement?"
"204987124-0-68212";"And in Southern Elsweyr as well?"
"204987124-0-68214";"Did they mention anything else worth noting?"
"204987124-0-68217";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68222";"So the artifacts are no longer a danger?"
"204987124-0-68223";"So you don't blame them for causing this?"
"204987124-0-68225";"Are you sure you should give it away?"
"204987124-0-68226";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-68227";"What's that item supposed to do?"
"204987124-0-68228";"Just what are you planning?"
"204987124-0-68229";"flv 2"
"204987124-0-68232";"So what do you think an egonymic is?"
"204987124-0-68235";"We found this Daedric relic hidden in a chest, but we don't know what it is."
"204987124-0-68236";"I'll show the Daedric relic to the Anchorite."
"204987124-0-68237";"What do you know about the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68238";"Tell me what brought you out here."
"204987124-0-68239";"You've already taken casualties. A trainee might not survive this."
"204987124-0-68240";"<<1>>."
"204987124-0-68242";"Can you tell me more about your order?"
"204987124-0-68243";"Your informant?"
"204987124-0-68244";"I'm accustomed to danger."
"204987124-0-68248";"We think it might be useful against Sombren and Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-68253";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-68254";"I'm helping the Fighters Guild find a way out of here."
"204987124-0-68255";"You think becoming a Battlemage is the best way to achieve peace?"
"204987124-0-68258";"Tell me more about Lyranth the Dremora."
"204987124-0-68262";"Are you sure your sister didn't join the cult?"
"204987124-0-68263";"Right. Sombren, Destron, and Calia."
"204987124-0-68266";"I'm not sure how we'll locate the Fourth Ambition if you couldn't find anything in the documents."
"204987124-0-68267";"To power that machine?"
"204987124-0-68268";"What else have you been doing since we last saw each other?"
"204987124-0-68270";"Do you know where it went?"
"204987124-0-68273";"The Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68274";"The Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68275";"All this trouble for a velvet pouch?"
"204987124-0-68276";"Were they trying to kill you?"
"204987124-0-68277";"They seemed to be after your item specifically."
"204987124-0-68281";"Shadows Crawl sounds like a big place. Any way to narrow down our search?"
"204987124-0-68282";"Where should I start my search?"
"204987124-0-68283";"Lyranth sent me to acquire the tincture."
"204987124-0-68285";"Remind me. Who am I impersonating again?"
"204987124-0-68287";"A base in Oblivion?"
"204987124-0-68288";"I encountered something called a cataclyst at the Dread Cellar."
"204987124-0-68289";"So now what?"
"204987124-0-68291";"And what will you do with the portal key?"
"204987124-0-68293";"Your father was a Longhouse Emperor and your mother a high-ranking cultist. There must be something."
"204987124-0-68294";"Maybe. We still need to find out how Mehrunes Dagon knows you and why he's interested in you."
"204987124-0-68295";"Dangerous how?"
"204987124-0-68296";"Can you trust him enough to continue the mission?"
"204987124-0-68297";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68298";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68299";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68300";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68301";"A way station?"
"204987124-0-68302";"Why do you think they need easy access between the two realms?"
"204987124-0-68303";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-68304";"Where will I find Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-68306";"The Fargrave cataclyst will perform admirably, I'm sure."
"204987124-0-68310";"Living disasters?"
"204987124-0-68311";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68312";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68313";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68314";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68315";"Do you know what the cataclyst does, acolyte?"
"204987124-0-68316";"Isn't Valkynaz Nokvroz our ally?"
"204987124-0-68317";"I thought Sister Celdina was in charge here."
"204987124-0-68320";"What was it like when the cataclyst was activated?"
"204987124-0-68321";"Do you know Valkynaz Nokvroz?"
"204987124-0-68322";"The Dread Cellar?"
"204987124-0-68324";"Tell me more about fluster fume root."
"204987124-0-68326";"Summoned?"
"204987124-0-68327";"What's Nocturnal's Summoning Day?"
"204987124-0-68328";"How does dousing the effigy in a brazier imbue it with energy from the Evergloam?"
"204987124-0-68330";"How many of you are there?"
"204987124-0-68332";"Leave? Where are you going?"
"204987124-0-68333";"Is something else bothering you, Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68335";"What about the second fragment?"
"204987124-0-68336";"How will the amulet lead us to Emperor Moricar's soul?"
"204987124-0-68339";"At Fort Grief, Sister Celdina and Valkynaz Nokvroz had some sort of falling out."
"204987124-0-68340";"You think the twisted rod could be important?"
"204987124-0-68341";"Does that mean we don't have to worry about Valkynaz Nokvroz any more?"
"204987124-0-68348";"The amulet that the old seer Elegian gave you?"
"204987124-0-68349";"I just did the same thing as before."
"204987124-0-68351";"Are you concerned about Lucilla telling your Spire Council about all this?"
"204987124-0-68352";"He doesn't seem so concerned about that."
"204987124-0-68354";"Can you tell me what you're remembering?"
"204987124-0-68355";"Tell me where this portal is located."
"204987124-0-68357";"All right. I'll go into the Deadlands and track a group of cultists. What about you?"
"204987124-0-68358";"And the Ravener killed them all?"
"204987124-0-68359";"Are you and Rynkyus friends?"
"204987124-0-68361";"What about Wretched Spire? What is it?"
"204987124-0-68362";"That leaves me and the Anchorite. What do you need us to do exactly?"
"204987124-0-68363";"You want to become a member of the Witchmother coven?"
"204987124-0-68366";"Why do the Anchorite's memories concern you?"
"204987124-0-68367";"Any idea on how we accomplish that?"
"204987124-0-68368";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-68371";"I found blood on the pedestal where that orb stood."
"204987124-0-68372";"Tell me what you remember."
"204987124-0-68374";"Weapon? What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-68379";"Deal with Mehrunes Dagon? How?"
"204987124-0-68380";"Tell me about this plan."
"204987124-0-68381";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-68385";"They attempted to deliver my world to Dagon by merging it with the Deadlands. I stopped them."
"204987124-0-68386";"Moricar said the emperors had a contingency plan. We can learn about it on the Isle of Joys."
"204987124-0-68388";"I'm ready to go to the Isle of Joys."
"204987124-0-68389";"Moricar said it was a retreat located not too far from the Brandfire Reformatory."
"204987124-0-68390";"Have the Bladebearers had trouble with Valkynaz Nokvroz before?"
"204987124-0-68391";"Who are Jynd and Zynoahz? Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-68393";"Tell me about your missing clan members."
"204987124-0-68394";"What do you mean, corrupt her?"
"204987124-0-68397";"What do you mean, desperate?"
"204987124-0-68398";"You think the book is affecting him, the way it bothered Eveli?"
"204987124-0-68401";"What do you make of Sister Celdina's testament?"
"204987124-0-68405";"Have the Bladebearers had trouble with Valkynaz Nokvroz before?"
"204987124-0-68406";"Is it unusual for them to be interested in mortals?"
"204987124-0-68408";"If I discover something useful, how can I find you?"
"204987124-0-68409";"I'll look for you beneath the northern cliffs after I'm done here."
"204987124-0-68410";"You don't want to search together?"
"204987124-0-68411";"I found drawings and a runic crux, and I learned that a blind seer invented the cataclyst."
"204987124-0-68412";"I'll search Jynd's foundry and meet you at the ritual site."
"204987124-0-68414";"Can I trust Rynkyus?"
"204987124-0-68417";"Like the one you found at Jynd's foundry? Did your scouts find the cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-68418";"Most likely."
"204987124-0-68421";"The journal mentions something called the egonymic."
"204987124-0-68422";"It's definitely one of those doomvaults. There's a location marked inside the vault."
"204987124-0-68423";"I explored a good deal of it."
"204987124-0-68426";"We still don't know how to kill it."
"204987124-0-68427";"Couldn't you kill the mortal leaders? Why rely on them?"
"204987124-0-68428";"So what purpose will a treaty serve if you're already here?"
"204987124-0-68429";"You mentioned taking Tephilaz to a necrologist. What is that?"
"204987124-0-68430";"Where did it come from?"
"204987124-0-68431";"Why doesn't Mehrunes Dagon destroy this place?"
"204987124-0-68432";"Tell me more about Tephilaz."
"204987124-0-68433";"Why didn't you stop the attack on him?"
"204987124-0-68435";"Why is Tephilaz so crucial to Wretched Spire's peace?"
"204987124-0-68436";"We still haven't learned how to destroy it."
"204987124-0-68437";"He said he had a Perfected Cataclyst. But listen. The Anchorite's memories have been restored."
"204987124-0-68439";"Valkynaz Nokvroz said he needed her blood to fuel his Perfected Cataclyst."
"204987124-0-68440";"Answer you? How?"
"204987124-0-68442";"All right, let's see what happens."
"204987124-0-68444";"Do you really think you can learn anything in Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-68448";"If he couldn't open it, how can we?"
"204987124-0-68455";"Elegian helped you escape that fate."
"204987124-0-68456";"All right. Let's go to Annihilarch's Summit."
"204987124-0-68459";"We can do this together, Anchorite."
"204987124-0-68461";"Anchorite, wait!"
"204987124-0-68462";"There's more. Sister Celdina ordered Jynd to send her more Dremora."
"204987124-0-68464";"What kind of signs are you looking for?"
"204987124-0-68465";"Sister Celdina must have the Dremora you're looking for."
"204987124-0-68467";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-68469";"If any Dremora can sense it, how is it secret?"
"204987124-0-68471";"Do you know Valkynaz Nokvroz?"
"204987124-0-68473";"Not even by death?"
"204987124-0-68475";"Does this have anything to do with what we found in the Red Petal Bastion?"
"204987124-0-68478";"What does Lyranth want with a corpse?"
"204987124-0-68480";"How did you become Lyranth's prophet?"
"204987124-0-68481";"Your calling?"
"204987124-0-68482";"You're willing to trade one of your holy relics?"
"204987124-0-68483";"Tell me more about the Knights of the Silver Rose."
"204987124-0-68484";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-68487";"All right. How do I sign up for one of these jobs?"
"204987124-0-68488";"It sounds like House Hexos has a lot of secrets."
"204987124-0-68489";"Tell me more about the jobs Vaveli Indavel offers."
"204987124-0-68490";"Tell me more about the jobs Luna Beriel offers."
"204987124-0-68492";"Tell me more about the jobs Luna Beriel offers."
"204987124-0-68493";"What sort of work are you hiring for?"
"204987124-0-68494";"It sounds like House Hexos has a lot of secrets."
"204987124-0-68496";"So you're thieves and spies."
"204987124-0-68497";"And that's lucrative?"
"204987124-0-68498";"You mentioned other groups. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-68499";"Protect your life. Destroy the orb."
"204987124-0-68501";"The blind seer?"
"204987124-0-68504";"The Riven Cataclyst. Where can I find it?"
"204987124-0-68505";"Where is the altar?"
"204987124-0-68506";"All right, is there anything you need to do before we place the Mother Stones?"
"204987124-0-68513";"Do you know who Elegian is or why he was imprisoned?"
"204987124-0-68514";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-68516";"Noticed? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-68518";"I see. Tell me if you remember anything else."
"204987124-0-68519";"Seems it was poison. What did you discuss before he died?"
"204987124-0-68520";"Why do you hate the Daedra residents so much?"
"204987124-0-68524";"All right. Let's find the orb."
"204987124-0-68525";"Lucents? Remind me about those."
"204987124-0-68527";"All right. I'll look for lucents."
"204987124-0-68530";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-68531";"I'll look for the elixir."
"204987124-0-68532";"Ask"
"204987124-0-68533";"We plan to destroy it. The Incarnates it creates threaten Fargrave and Nirn."
"204987124-0-68535";"My companion, the Anchorite. Do you know her?"
"204987124-0-68537";"No, but he made her mask. Said it makes her forget her past and makes those who knew her forget her."
"204987124-0-68539";"So let's head to Annihilarch's Summit and finish this."
"204987124-0-68540";"If you didn't meet Elegian here, then where else could you know him from?"
"204987124-0-68543";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-68549";"The Incarnates we saw were practically mindless. Can Celdina actually control an army of them?"
"204987124-0-68550";"Elegian has something to do with the Anchorite. He made her mask."
"204987124-0-68551";"After that?"
"204987124-0-68552";"And?"
"204987124-0-68553";"I hope you'll be more observant when we reach Annihilarch's Summit."
"204987124-0-68554";"So you don't know where you were before Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-68556";"Hop in my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-68557";"What if we used both stones to free Nilera and Sovisa?"
"204987124-0-68558";"So you're confident you can deal with Sombren?"
"204987124-0-68569";"No. I found papers that claim the Waking Flame cult has infiltrated town, and they have local help."
"204987124-0-68570";"I'll meet you back at Spire Hall."
"204987124-0-68571";"I'll go to the Waking Flame camp."
"204987124-0-68575";"What was it you gave to Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68576";"What will you do now that this is over?"
"204987124-0-68578";"Rogatus also claimed to be Lyranth's prophet."
"204987124-0-68579";"Lyranth is fond of me?"
"204987124-0-68580";"Is it safe?"
"204987124-0-68581";"So, besides delivering messages for the Dread Lady, what does a prophet do exactly?"
"204987124-0-68582";"Lyranth the Dremora and I go way back."
"204987124-0-68583";"You seemed concerned that the Ravener spoke. What does it matter?"
"204987124-0-68588";"Do you think Sister Celdina knows that Nokvroz wants to build his own cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-68589";"I'll see you at the summit."
"204987124-0-68590";"Displace her?"
"204987124-0-68592";"What do you mean, Arox?"
"204987124-0-68593";"All right, let's look around."
"204987124-0-68599";"You remind me of Rogatus Cinna."
"204987124-0-68600";"You remind me of Rogatus Cinna."
"204987124-0-68602";"Can't you attune the portal key?"
"204987124-0-68603";"Why do you think Arox knows about Ardent Hope?"
"204987124-0-68604";"Who is Merrunz?"
"204987124-0-68605";"If your sister never came home, how do you know she's here?"
"204987124-0-68609";"Will you be able to get home?"
"204987124-0-68612";"Nokvroz captured the Anchorite and plans to send Incarnates to conquer Fargrave for Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-68613";"We'll meet you at the portal dais."
"204987124-0-68614";"Do you think you can attune the portal key to get us inside the fortress?"
"204987124-0-68617";"What if Sombren has already given his power to Mehrunes Dagon?"
"204987124-0-68618";"I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-68621";"Do you think that other battlemage was behind all this?"
"204987124-0-68622";"Do you think you and Lucilla will reconcile?"
"204987124-0-68623";"Do you know what the abomination was?"
"204987124-0-68624";"Will you ever forgive Martus?"
"204987124-0-68625";"What will you do next?"
"204987124-0-68628";"Do you regret killing him?"
"204987124-0-68630";"And you believed that?"
"204987124-0-68631";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-68632";"What's your coven's interest in the Crowborne Horror?"
"204987124-0-68633";"You said something about a pocket realm?"
"204987124-0-68634";"And you're sure that's safe?"
"204987124-0-68637";"You're very optimistic."
"204987124-0-68638";"I need to save the Anchorite."
"204987124-0-68639";"Good luck? Where are you going?"
"204987124-0-68640";"I will."
"204987124-0-68641";"Distraction?"
"204987124-0-68644";"You mentioned enemies?"
"204987124-0-68646";"What kind of ward?"
"204987124-0-68648";"I'll go find the Riven Cataclyst."
"204987124-0-68649";"These Daedra seem to want peace."
"204987124-0-68650";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-68652";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-68653";"How did you arrive here?"
"204987124-0-68654";"How long ago did that happen?"
"204987124-0-68655";"Why do you hate the Daedra residents so much?"
"204987124-0-68664";"What do you think happened here?"
"204987124-0-68666";"Do you know what this twisted rod might be used for?"
"204987124-0-68667";"Hop into my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-68668";"How do you know Atrozu can track the Ravener?"
"204987124-0-68671";"How will you get back to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-68672";"For a time?"
"204987124-0-68674";"What do you think, Arox?"
"204987124-0-68678";"What happens when we find the Anchorite?"
"204987124-0-68680";"Have you learned anything else about the twisted rod?"
"204987124-0-68681";"What do you mean, the path of cowardice?"
"204987124-0-68682";"All right, Arox. Hop in my pack."
"204987124-0-68683";"Do you want to return to Mehrunes Dagon's service?"
"204987124-0-68684";"If we defeat Valkynaz Nokvroz, what will his followers do?"
"204987124-0-68686";"Won't Valkynaz Nokvroz resume command when he eventually returns?"
"204987124-0-68687";"Who are the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68688";"All this trouble for a velvet pouch?"
"204987124-0-68689";"Were they trying to kill you?"
"204987124-0-68694";"Remind me about the Prince of Destruction and the Waking Flame."
"204987124-0-68695";"More prudent? How so?"
"204987124-0-68696";"Does this have anything to do with what we found in the Red Petal Bastion?"
"204987124-0-68697";"Is this related to Leovic's secret and the Four Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-68698";"Can they do that to you whenever they want?"
"204987124-0-68699";"Does this have anything to do with what we found in the Red Petal Bastion?"
"204987124-0-68700";"Could it be Faven? He hates the Daedra."
"204987124-0-68701";"Does that price bother you?"
"204987124-0-68702";"And they brought you here?"
"204987124-0-68705";"Can you make sense of those symbols I found at Vontan's hovel?"
"204987124-0-68710";"Any idea who might be helping the Dagon cult?"
"204987124-0-68713";"And that's bad?"
"204987124-0-68724";"Tell me more about the tension in Wretched Spire."
"204987124-0-68745";"Why were you meeting with Tephilaz?"
"204987124-0-68751";"Not from Nirn? What are these musicians?"
"204987124-0-68752";"You said the votive rune affects mortals. Is that what made our hands glow?"
"204987124-0-68755";"The Anchorite sent me. She said you know everything that happens here."
"204987124-0-68758";"I'll tell her. Do you know what the cult plans to do with the votive runes?"
"204987124-0-68759";"He said Celdina's using the votives to conquer Fargrave and to look for an unusually hot building."
"204987124-0-68761";"Find a lucent, got it. Then what?"
"204987124-0-68762";"Why are you so intent on finding Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-68765";"Do you know what that ritual was all about? How was it going to help the cult conquer Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-68766";"Is there anything you can do to help poor Joset?"
"204987124-0-68767";"Why are you willing to help the Anchorite?"
"204987124-0-68768";"You mentioned three paths we could take to get to the bathhouse."
"204987124-0-68770";"Can you decipher it?"
"204987124-0-68771";"What should we do now?"
"204987124-0-68772";"Lyranth, maybe you can convince them?"
"204987124-0-68775";"Who are they, where can I find them, and how much will it cost me?"
"204987124-0-68776";"Are you still trying to find out more about the cataclyst devices?"
"204987124-0-68777";"That sounds dangerous."
"204987124-0-68779";"This is about your mask?"
"204987124-0-68780";"Is that why you became the darling of the alleys?"
"204987124-0-68782";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-68783";"We were told you could decipher any Dagonic code."
"204987124-0-68784";"How do we get to this keep?"
"204987124-0-68786";"What are they trying to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-68787";"Is there anything else you can tell me about the cult?"
"204987124-0-68788";"How did Pibiha get kidnapped by the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68789";"Why did Pibiha laugh about the Brandfire Reformatory?"
"204987124-0-68791";"How did Pibiha get kidnapped by the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-68792";"Do you have any idea what goes on inside the Reformatory?"
"204987124-0-68794";"Why can't you just do this yourself?"
"204987124-0-68795";"What's the Evergloam?"
"204987124-0-68796";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-68800";"So how do we find the Riven Cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-68804";"What can you tell me about the Dread Cellar?"
"204987124-0-68805";"Living disasters?"
"204987124-0-68810";"Who are you two?"
"204987124-0-68811";"What is the Battlespire?"
"204987124-0-68812";"If you survive?"
"204987124-0-68813";"How is your injury?"
"204987124-0-68816";"But you still want the Crowborne Horror defeated?"
"204987124-0-68821";"You're going to purchase favors with the treasure?"
"204987124-0-68822";"How will these goods be worth favors?"
"204987124-0-68824";"And what did you do to them?"
"204987124-0-68825";"Who was Cyronin?"
"204987124-0-68826";"Do you regret your time here?"
"204987124-0-68829";"Why does Mehrunes Dagon want his legions to ignore Wretched Spire?"
"204987124-0-68831";"Do you have advice for fighting the Unmaker?"
"204987124-0-68835";"All right. Tell me what you know about the Waking Flame and their votive runes."
"204987124-0-68836";"Any idea why the cult is placing the votive runes throughout Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-68838";"Tell me about Sister Celdina."
"204987124-0-68839";"Does the name Lyranth mean anything to you?"
"204987124-0-68841";"Why do you think we'll find Rynkyus there?"
"204987124-0-68842";"Are you and Rynkyus friends?"
"204987124-0-68845";"All right, I'll meet you in the Shambles."
"204987124-0-68849";"Did Lyranth tell you what happened in Fargrave and the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-68852";"Is there anything I need to know about the stones or the Unmaker?"
"204987124-0-68853";"What's the Unmaker's reformation cycle?"
"204987124-0-68856";"We believe it has something to do with the votive runes the cult has been placing around Fargrave."
"204987124-0-68857";"Why did you summon us, Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68860";"And what do you think will happen?"
"204987124-0-68863";"All right, I'll see what I can find in the bathhouse."
"204987124-0-68876";"Gazmod the Collector, villa on the west side of town. Got it. And what did that information cost me?"
"204987124-0-68877";"Where do we find Jynd and Zynoahz?"
"204987124-0-68878";"What is Daze?"
"204987124-0-68881";"Contingency?"
"204987124-0-68884";"Emperor Moricar said it was possible to use the Ambitions to defeat Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-68886";"All right, I'll meet you at the Collector's villa."
"204987124-0-68891";"If we take you with us, will you promise to decipher the code when we reach a safe location?"
"204987124-0-68892";"Very well. Hop in my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-68893";"What happened to the last group?"
"204987124-0-68900";"Are you uncomfortable working with me?"
"204987124-0-68901";"I won't stop you from leaving, but you shouldn't kill Martus."
"204987124-0-68903";"Why do you think so little of mortals?"
"204987124-0-68904";"Why do you think so little of mortals?"
"204987124-0-68909";"What's the signal?"
"204987124-0-68910";"You want me to ring the bell?"
"204987124-0-68913";"If any Dremora can sense it, how is it secret?"
"204987124-0-68914";"Not even by death?"
"204987124-0-68917";"Any idea who could really be behind this?"
"204987124-0-68918";"What happens to the Dread Cellar now?"
"204987124-0-68920";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-68921";"Do you think it's worth looking into?"
"204987124-0-68923";"How did you find the antidote?"
"204987124-0-68928";"The Incarnates we saw were practically mindless. Can Celdina actually control an army of them?"
"204987124-0-68929";"Why are the Daedra volunteering to become Incarnates?"
"204987124-0-68930";"If we destroy this cataclyst, won't they just make another one?"
"204987124-0-68932";"What do you think she's going to do with all that power?"
"204987124-0-68933";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-68934";"Lyranth's been an ally to us so far."
"204987124-0-68937";"Why do you call her Lyranth the Foolkiller?"
"204987124-0-68938";"It sounds like you don't think highly of Xivilai."
"204987124-0-68940";"I'll meet you in Fargrave, then."
"204987124-0-68942";"Eveli and I can handle things."
"204987124-0-68943";"Did we get rid of Mehrunes Dagon for good?"
"204987124-0-68944";"Where did the egonymic send him?"
"204987124-0-68949";"Do you think we've seen the last of Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68951";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-68952";"Can you do that?"
"204987124-0-68953";"Do you have someone in mind?"
"204987124-0-68955";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-68957";"Do you think that's what's causing the strange magical incidents?"
"204987124-0-68964";"Was this your plan all along?"
"204987124-0-68968";"It doesn't need to end like this, Lyranth."
"204987124-0-68969";"Wait, there's still more I want to ask you."
"204987124-0-68974";"She didn't really say."
"204987124-0-68975";"Where are we meeting in Leyawiin?"
"204987124-0-68976";"Do you think we should tell anyone else about Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-68978";"We'll just have to wait and see."
"204987124-0-68992";"What's a tincture of befuddlement?"
"204987124-0-68993";"Won't the wards stop you, too?"
"204987124-0-68994";"And where can I get this tincture?"
"204987124-0-68995";"Tell me more about fluster fume root."
"204987124-0-68996";"How did you get the Anchorite to remember Elegian's name?"
"204987124-0-68998";"Can you help her remember everything she's forgotten?"
"204987124-0-69008";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-69013";"Hop in my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-69014";"Do you know how to get inside?"
"204987124-0-69017";"Tell me more about the Anchorite's mask."
"204987124-0-69019";"But I haven't forgotten about her."
"204987124-0-69020";"Why did you design the cataclyst for them?"
"204987124-0-69021";"We can help you escape."
"204987124-0-69022";"Who are you? How did you end up in this place?"
"204987124-0-69023";"Why all the subterfuge? Can't we just rush through and attack?"
"204987124-0-69024";"Why all the subterfuge? Can't we just rush through and attack?"
"204987124-0-69027";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-69028";"I haven't found her yet."
"204987124-0-69029";"Then why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-69035";"Why do you keep calling me Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-69036";"I'll go to the Shambles and find Arox."
"204987124-0-69038";"Yes, she's gathering allies at Wretched Spire. Will you join us?"
"204987124-0-69040";"I suppose it is a little awkward."
"204987124-0-69045";"Why do you need the Ambitions' power?"
"204987124-0-69046";"Our allies are meeting in Leyawiin. Will you join us?"
"204987124-0-69047";"Why do you need the Ambitions' power?"
"204987124-0-69048";"Why do you need the Ambitions' power?"
"204987124-0-69050";"Why do I need a rune of compulsion?"
"204987124-0-69051";"Why do we need those specific vintages?"
"204987124-0-69053";"Right. I remember that."
"204987124-0-69054";"Right, and we still don't know what happened to the missing Bladebearers."
"204987124-0-69055";"The Incarnates we saw were practically mindless. Can Celdina actually control an army of them?"
"204987124-0-69056";"Aren't Dremora evil? Why should I help her?"
"204987124-0-69057";"Sweet Daffodil is an unusual mount, isn't she?"
"204987124-0-69058";"Thank you, Elegian. We'll take care of the cataclyst."
"204987124-0-69059";"Where will you go now?"
"204987124-0-69061";"What will you do after returning to the town?"
"204987124-0-69063";"You haven't been to Mournhold yet?"
"204987124-0-69064";"You had to make an impossible decision."
"204987124-0-69067";"Will you go back to Fargrave eventually?"
"204987124-0-69075";"So now what?"
"204987124-0-69076";"Why do we need roots and a tincture?"
"204987124-0-69078";"All right. I'll get the fluster fume root and the tincture of befuddlement for you."
"204987124-0-69079";"But what did we learn?"
"204987124-0-69080";"I'll see if I can track her down."
"204987124-0-69084";"I'll talk to Arox."
"204987124-0-69085";"What is the Battlespire?"
"204987124-0-69086";"What is the Battlespire?"
"204987124-0-69087";"But you feel otherwise?"
"204987124-0-69088";"What about your injury?"
"204987124-0-69089";"What about your injury?"
"204987124-0-69092";"For the Cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69094";"He didn't return to the Battlespire?"
"204987124-0-69095";"What's your history with the Dread Cellar?"
"204987124-0-69096";"And why is it important that we sneak into this base?"
"204987124-0-69097";"And you think we can accomplish all that by sneaking into their base?"
"204987124-0-69098";"What's a tincture of befuddlement?"
"204987124-0-69100";"How does the cataclyst relate to our attempts to find the Four Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-69101";"There must be some connection."
"204987124-0-69102";"Do you know what the cataclyst does, acolyte?"
"204987124-0-69103";"What does any of this have to do with the Four Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-69104";"Isn't Valkynaz Nokvroz our ally?"
"204987124-0-69105";"I'll meet you in Leyawiin."
"204987124-0-69110";"But what did you learn about the cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69112";"Did you destroy the cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69113";"I still don't understand why you're interested in all this."
"204987124-0-69114";"But what did you learn about the cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69115";"Did you see anyone near him when this happened?"
"204987124-0-69117";"What do you think about the tensions in Wretched Spire?"
"204987124-0-69124";"You do? What's Mehrunes Dagon planning to do?"
"204987124-0-69125";"Tell me more about the relic."
"204987124-0-69126";"You stole the Redmaiden to save Elisa, right?"
"204987124-0-69132";"Why do you think Lyranth's so upset?"
"204987124-0-69138";"Why do we care where the soul of the Longhouse Emperor is?"
"204987124-0-69141";"So why does the Tong hire adventurers?"
"204987124-0-69142";"Mehrunes Dagon is my enemy. Tell me about this plan of yours."
"204987124-0-69146";"Fine, I'll find your friends and meet you at the portal to Fargrave."
"204987124-0-69147";"I don't understand. Noroth said he will translate."
"204987124-0-69149";"I can collect the substance. What will you do?"
"204987124-0-69150";"What do you know about Faven?"
"204987124-0-69151";"You seem rather calm about delivering an apocalyptic message from a Dremora."
"204987124-0-69153";"All right. I'll let Sweet Daffodil take me to your Dread Lady."
"204987124-0-69154";"I'll find her. You need to meet Bakh at the portal to Fargrave."
"204987124-0-69155";"How is Daze made?"
"204987124-0-69156";"Why do the Daedra take Daze if it's so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-69158";"What does Mantikora venom do?"
"204987124-0-69159";"Do all Mantikora produce this venom?"
"204987124-0-69160";"What do you need from the samples?"
"204987124-0-69164";"Have you talked to Sombren about any of this?"
"204987124-0-69173";"You scryed for a cure?"
"204987124-0-69176";"How do we proceed?"
"204987124-0-69178";"Hop into the pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-69180";"I assume you have a plan?"
"204987124-0-69182";"I'll meet you at Annihilarch's Summit so we can destroy the cataclyst."
"204987124-0-69183";"What do you mean they use your essence? We thought the cataclyst transforms Daedra into Incarnates."
"204987124-0-69188";"You expected him to die?"
"204987124-0-69189";"Who is Madam Whim?"
"204987124-0-69191";"Yes, this planestone."
"204987124-0-69197";"The planestone was in the Folly, Telofasa was not."
"204987124-0-69200";"Is it a problem that the rods are now in a Mantikora's lair?"
"204987124-0-69201";"Why do you need rods for the teleportation spell?"
"204987124-0-69202";"How will I know the rods when I see them?"
"204987124-0-69203";"Yes, here it is."
"204987124-0-69206";"A worthy plan, Sister Celdina."
"204987124-0-69207";"What do you think it is?"
"204987124-0-69220";"What have you learned so far?"
"204987124-0-69221";"Is there anything I need to know about the stones or the Unmaker?"
"204987124-0-69222";"Is there anything I need to know about the stones or the Unmaker?"
"204987124-0-69223";"Why do you think this memory is important?"
"204987124-0-69228";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69229";"You seemed pretty angry when the Anchorite decided to go with Sombren and Calia."
"204987124-0-69231";"How will you follow them?"
"204987124-0-69232";"The Anchorite can handle herself."
"204987124-0-69234";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69235";"You said the Gleaners have an arrangement with the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69236";"And Fargrave doesn't care about your activities?"
"204987124-0-69237";"Who are the Grasp?"
"204987124-0-69238";"Why did you chose the Gleaners for this?"
"204987124-0-69239";"What do you do for the Gleaners?"
"204987124-0-69240";"If no one's left the Brandfire Reformatory, how do you know there are valuables in there?"
"204987124-0-69241";"So you've seen what's inside the Reformatory?"
"204987124-0-69242";"You were in the Folly before. Why can't you go back there?"
"204987124-0-69244";"So, there's no guarantee that these plants will be helpful?"
"204987124-0-69245";"Can you tell me anything about the False Martyrs' Folly?"
"204987124-0-69246";"What makes the Blood Pit so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-69247";"But you just said that you normally make the drops yourself."
"204987124-0-69248";"Why the rush?"
"204987124-0-69249";"If goods aren't safe in the Shambles, why use those drop sites?"
"204987124-0-69250";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69253";"Do you have any idea what the treasure is?"
"204987124-0-69254";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-69256";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69257";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-69258";"Why are these defenses shutdown?"
"204987124-0-69259";"But there's still security keeping you trapped here, right?"
"204987124-0-69260";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69261";"Spiritual escapees?"
"204987124-0-69263";"Where can I find these other matrices?"
"204987124-0-69264";"I'll try to find the other inactive matrices."
"204987124-0-69267";"Meaning what?"
"204987124-0-69268";"What are its duties?"
"204987124-0-69269";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69270";"Couldn't it help you out of here?"
"204987124-0-69271";"I'll search for the last matrix."
"204987124-0-69274";"That's not nearly as frightening as the other two."
"204987124-0-69275";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69276";"Good luck, Vitellia."
"204987124-0-69280";"What do you want me to do if I find the cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69285";"Sister Celdina also believes she gave birth to Emperor Moricar's child."
"204987124-0-69286";"Yes, I found this strange crystal key."
"204987124-0-69287";"I've got a blade of my own that might jog your memory."
"204987124-0-69289";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-69291";"You let Dagonists into your shop?"
"204987124-0-69301";"What will you do with it if we find it?"
"204987124-0-69306";"Why don't you tell anyone else how to escape the Blood Pit?"
"204987124-0-69307";"How does the Gleaners' gleam work?"
"204987124-0-69308";"Centuries? How old are you?"
"204987124-0-69311";"Luna said you were trying to keep a low profile."
"204987124-0-69313";"What was that about a strange book?"
"204987124-0-69314";"What are you trying to retrieve?"
"204987124-0-69316";"You can pay me again when I defeat them too."
"204987124-0-69317";"<Enter <<1>>.>"
"204987124-0-69318";"Raiding villages? So there are more people still inside?"
"204987124-0-69320";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-69321";"<Enter Shipwright's Regret.>"
"204987124-0-69323";"All right, I'll help with your rescue and recovery mission."
"204987124-0-69329";"I'll take care of this. Stay here where it's safe."
"204987124-0-69335";"Do you think someone in House Hexos produced this?"
"204987124-0-69336";"Divayth is threatening to make life very difficult for you. Help us and we'll leave you alone."
"204987124-0-69337";"A sundial? What does it do?"
"204987124-0-69339";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-69340";"I defeated an extremely powerful creature. Your readers should avoid these locations."
"204987124-0-69341";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-69342";"Why would Lyranth want your powers?"
"204987124-0-69343";"What about your memories?"
"204987124-0-69344";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-69345";"How did you escape Destruction's Solace?"
"204987124-0-69346";"What do you plan to do now?"
"204987124-0-69347";"Thank you for your help, Arox."
"204987124-0-69348";"Is that possible?"
"204987124-0-69349";"How did you escape Destruction's Solace?"
"204987124-0-69350";"Do you have any idea why Lyranth took the powers of the Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-69351";"I'll let you get back to work."
"204987124-0-69354";"I'll let you get back to work."
"204987124-0-69355";"I'll let you get back to work."
"204987124-0-69357";"I have questions."
"204987124-0-69358";"How are you connected to Madam Whim?"
"204987124-0-69360";"Do you know anything more about this Daedric threat?"
"204987124-0-69361";"Do you know what the enchantment does?"
"204987124-0-69362";"Sounds like trouble."
"204987124-0-69364";"I saved Vivec from a plot to drain his power and pass it to Clavicus Vile."
"204987124-0-69366";"Wouldn't Nokvroz's fortress be protected against a portal key used by the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-69367";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69368";"You think the twisted rod is important?"
"204987124-0-69369";"Doesn't that get boring?"
"204987124-0-69370";"What will you do now, Rynkyus?"
"204987124-0-69371";"Do you have any idea why Lyranth took the powers of the Ambitions?"
"204987124-0-69372";"You think the twisted rod is important?"
"204987124-0-69373";"I know a bit more, if you're interested."
"204987124-0-69374";"There's more."
"204987124-0-69375";"I can tell you more, if you'd like."
"204987124-0-69376";"If you two hate each other so much, why would he agree to help us?"
"204987124-0-69377";"Yes, I do."
"204987124-0-69390";"What if I can't find charged lucents?"
"204987124-0-69393";"Elegian, you're not making any sense."
"204987124-0-69400";"Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-69401";"The Grasp?"
"204987124-0-69402";"What does that mean, exactly?"
"204987124-0-69403";"What kind of business?"
"204987124-0-69404";"Why is this place called the Celestial Palanquin?"
"204987124-0-69405";"Why is that important?"
"204987124-0-69406";"Is there anything you can do to help poor Joset?"
"204987124-0-69407";"I couldn't help noticing the giant skeletons."
"204987124-0-69408";"Is there anything you can do to help poor Joset?"
"204987124-0-69414";"Who are the Vanquished?"
"204987124-0-69415";"How have you killed the Unmaker when Daedra struggle with it?"
"204987124-0-69416";"What sort of treasure is in the Unmaker's hoard?"
"204987124-0-69417";"You don't seem pleased by the others."
"204987124-0-69418";"You mentioned other groups. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-69419";"Why are there so many different groups?"
"204987124-0-69420";"Who typically gives you work to hand out?"
"204987124-0-69421";"How long does it take the Unmaker to reform?"
"204987124-0-69424";"Why can't he learn from the Daedra?"
"204987124-0-69426";"Uxark's treasure isn't a secret anymore. The only way to keep it safe now is to let Nass have it."
"204987124-0-69427";"Nass and Madam Whim are well respected, even among mortals."
"204987124-0-69429";"Did you find Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-69430";"Why are you so intent on finding Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-69432";"What do you need us to do, Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-69434";"What agreement did Mehrunes Dagon break?"
"204987124-0-69435";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69436";"What's a Havocrel?"
"204987124-0-69437";"Why do you call the Anchorite the darling of the alleys?"
"204987124-0-69438";"Venom-charred bodies?"
"204987124-0-69439";"How did you kill the other Mantikora?"
"204987124-0-69440";"Charge the lucent on the font. Then what?"
"204987124-0-69441";"All right, I'll find a lucent and follow your instructions."
"204987124-0-69442";"I'm ready to stop Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-69443";"Is one act of revenge worth an eternity as a daedrat?"
"204987124-0-69445";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69447";"I am ready to stop Mehrunes Dagon."
"204987124-0-69448";"I want to know how many Bladebearers will accompany me."
"204987124-0-69455";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-69456";"The pain of dying means so little to you?"
"204987124-0-69457";"What concerns you about the Anchorite?"
"204987124-0-69458";"What next for the Bladebearers?"
"204987124-0-69459";"Would Mehrunes Dagon's minions build another cataclyst?"
"204987124-0-69460";"How bad were the Bladebearer losses in the fight at Ardent Hope?"
"204987124-0-69461";"If you don't know what the treasure is, why do you want it?"
"204987124-0-69462";"Is that the treasure you've sent me to retrieve?"
"204987124-0-69463";"How did Uxark amass the treasure?"
"204987124-0-69464";"How did Uxark amass the treasure?"
"204987124-0-69465";"Did I offend you?"
"204987124-0-69467";"How did you find Skoedal?"
"204987124-0-69468";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69470";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69473";"What happened before we arrived at Annihilarch's Summit?"
"204987124-0-69475";"The book? You mean the Mysterium Xarxes?"
"204987124-0-69476";"And was that really Destron?"
"204987124-0-69478";"You should be safe in Fargrave. Mehrunes Dagon can't reach you here."
"204987124-0-69481";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-69482";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-69483";"Where is Vein Splitter?"
"204987124-0-69484";"Daedra won't, but mortals would."
"204987124-0-69488";"Do you think the Anchorite will be all right?"
"204987124-0-69491";"And how does that help us?"
"204987124-0-69492";"What will you do now that you have Uxark's Treasure?"
"204987124-0-69494";"Are all of the jobs you handle so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-69495";"Mehrunes Dagon seemed interested in the Anchorite. This might not be over yet."
"204987124-0-69497";"Mehrunes Dagon seemed interested in the Anchorite. This might not be over yet."
"204987124-0-69499";"I'll help you investigate the Bladebearer clan and their connection to the events at the keep."
"204987124-0-69500";"Why do you think Sombren is doing this? He was our friend."
"204987124-0-69501";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-69502";"Who's Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-69503";"Where's your crew, captain?"
"204987124-0-69504";"Tell me more about your mission."
"204987124-0-69505";"An apparition?"
"204987124-0-69507";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69508";"The Stricture?"
"204987124-0-69510";"So the Grasp of the Stricture are law enforcers?"
"204987124-0-69511";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-69512";"You mentioned other groups. Who are they?"
"204987124-0-69513";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69516";"Nocturnal made a play for the Clockwork City, but my allies and I stopped her and saved Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-69517";"I saved Vivec from a plot to drain his power and pass it to Clavicus Vile."
"204987124-0-69518";"Do you know where to find Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-69519";"How'd you get ahead of me?"
"204987124-0-69520";"Nocturnal made a play for the Clockwork City, but my allies and I stopped her and saved Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-69526";"Why do you need to hire adventurers if you have your own thieves?"
"204987124-0-69527";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-69528";"And what kind of Daedra are you, Madam Whim?"
"204987124-0-69530";"The votives are prayers to Dagon. The magic only affects mortals, but neither of them knew any more."
"204987124-0-69532";"Shouldn't we go after Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-69533";"I'll pay the fine."
"204987124-0-69534";"We were sort of busy fighting for our lives. And both Valkynaz Nokvroz and Sister Celdina got away."
"204987124-0-69536";"Not necessarily. Bladebearer Dothaz said they have another stronghold. A place called Deadlight."
"204987124-0-69537";"I'll meet you in Fargrave, at the House of Whims."
"204987124-0-69538";"What would convince you to tell us where to find Master Rrvenk?"
"204987124-0-69539";"You want an apocalypse seed?"
"204987124-0-69540";"You're fishing?"
"204987124-0-69541";"Mortals fish, you know."
"204987124-0-69542";"You're fishing?"
"204987124-0-69543";"I understand. Let's begin."
"204987124-0-69546";"What do you know about Varallion?"
"204987124-0-69547";"You believe that?"
"204987124-0-69548";"What were they trying to get you to tell them?"
"204987124-0-69549";"A noise?"
"204987124-0-69550";"We're looking for a letter and medallion, right? Why are the Ascendant Order so interested in them?"
"204987124-0-69551";"What does it mean, the Anchorite?"
"204987124-0-69552";"Why do you need a distraction?"
"204987124-0-69553";"She said Gazmod the Collector might have something to help decipher the encoded note."
"204987124-0-69555";"And you really can't remember anything from before you arrived in Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-69556";"You can't do it yourself?"
"204987124-0-69559";"A new danger. The Dagonists built a device to create Incarnates—monsters that threaten my world."
"204987124-0-69560";"They're Dremora transformed into living disasters. We want to destroy the device that creates them."
"204987124-0-69562";"Very well, I'll pay."
"204987124-0-69564";"It seemed like something you might be interested in."
"204987124-0-69566";"Who is ""she""?"
"204987124-0-69570";"Morah said you might be able to help us find Master Rrvenk."
"204987124-0-69571";"I'll speak to Gilfrex about your debt."
"204987124-0-69572";"And if you weren't, would you cooperate?"
"204987124-0-69573";"I'll pay."
"204987124-0-69576";"Arox, the rest of the encoded note, please."
"204987124-0-69577";"What does Shiro-dar owe you?"
"204987124-0-69578";"Then we should head for Burning Gyre Keep."
"204987124-0-69579";"Is Shiro-dar's debt really worth all the effort you're putting into collecting?"
"204987124-0-69580";"Why did you hire Shiro-dar, anyway?"
"204987124-0-69581";"I'll let him know."
"204987124-0-69582";"Why do you want the Slave Choker?"
"204987124-0-69583";"How did the Slave Choker end up in the Folly?"
"204987124-0-69585";"I've got a blade of my own that might jog your memory."
"204987124-0-69586";"I completed your errand."
"204987124-0-69589";"I'm not opposed to breaking bones myself …."
"204987124-0-69591";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-69593";"So Shiro-dar's debt is cleared?"
"204987124-0-69595";"Now will you tell us where to find Master Rrvenk?"
"204987124-0-69596";"I hope so."
"204987124-0-69597";"Where can we find Hyxo?"
"204987124-0-69600";"I'd rather just pay the fine."
"204987124-0-69603";"What are you asking of us?"
"204987124-0-69605";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-69606";"Now will you tell me where to find him?"
"204987124-0-69608";"I will."
"204987124-0-69609";"So how did the Grasp get involved?"
"204987124-0-69614";"The Dremora?"
"204987124-0-69616";"All right. I'll help you deal with the votive runes. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-69618";"So you're just going to give up?"
"204987124-0-69622";"Stop looking for someone to fix your problem and get a hold of yourself."
"204987124-0-69623";"Meaning what exactly?"
"204987124-0-69624";"How does it feel to be working with Jakarn again?"
"204987124-0-69626";"You heard Ordinator Nilera fight Dagon?"
"204987124-0-69627";"Tell me more about your Grandmother, Sovisa."
"204987124-0-69628";"What will happen if you don't free Ordinator Nilera's spirit?"
"204987124-0-69629";"What will happen if you don't save your grandmother's spirit?"
"204987124-0-69630";"Tell me more about Ordinator Nilera."
"204987124-0-69632";"Hop in my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-69635";"What if we used both stones to free Nilera and Sovisa?"
"204987124-0-69636";"Why do mortals need to be anchored to Fargrave?"
"204987124-0-69637";"Who are these criminals?"
"204987124-0-69638";"Why would the thieves need to steal it?"
"204987124-0-69639";"I don't remember seeing you in the Deadlands when I rescued Fingaenion's wife and the others."
"204987124-0-69640";"Did Gilraen tell you what I did?"
"204987124-0-69641";"You're well informed for a lost traveler."
"204987124-0-69642";"I'd like a blessing."
"204987124-0-69644";"He's waiting for you at the portal to Fargrave."
"204987124-0-69646";"Turn yourselves in. You may serve a sentence, but you'll be safe."
"204987124-0-69647";"Is there any way to stop it?"
"204987124-0-69650";"Why didn't you take it immediately if you're so sick?"
"204987124-0-69651";"What duty?"
"204987124-0-69652";"Why did you make the deal?"
"204987124-0-69654";"So you made the deal when your rescue mission went badly?"
"204987124-0-69657";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-69661";"And what is your work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-69662";"What do you make of this place?"
"204987124-0-69663";"What can you tell me about the Ebony Blade?"
"204987124-0-69664";"Will I see you back in the Clockwork City soon?"
"204987124-0-69665";"Can you tell me about the Ebony Blade?"
"204987124-0-69666";"Can you tell me about the Ebony Blade?"
"204987124-0-69667";"Right. And we stopped another sect of the cult from conquering Fargrave."
"204987124-0-69668";"How do we find Sombren and Calia? Do you know where they are?"
"204987124-0-69670";"Doesn't working in service of someone make him your master?"
"204987124-0-69673";"What makes the Blood Pit so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-69678";"How do we attune the portal key?"
"204987124-0-69680";"I'll ask Madam Whim to attune the portal key to get us into Ardent Hope."
"204987124-0-69681";"How do you know about this venom?"
"204987124-0-69682";"The Anchorite and I will find out what Elegian knows about the Riven Cataclyst."
"204987124-0-69684";"There's no way to remove the ward?"
"204987124-0-69687";"Who's Merrunz?"
"204987124-0-69688";"Your pilgrimage is to explore the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-69689";"Why were you required to serve as their guide?"
"204987124-0-69690";"Pacts seem important."
"204987124-0-69691";"How do you know so much about it? You're not a scholar or mage."
"204987124-0-69693";"What is Redmaiden?"
"204987124-0-69694";"The cataclyst threatens Fargrave and Nirn. Shouldn't I destroy it?"
"204987124-0-69695";"Will you be safe here on your own?"
"204987124-0-69696";"If I examine it, what am I looking for, exactly?"
"204987124-0-69697";"Aren't you coming with me?"
"204987124-0-69699";"Tephilaz had just met with Faven Indoril for negotiations."
"204987124-0-69700";"What more can you tell me about this Spiderkith, Skrix?"
"204987124-0-69701";"Where can we find this Skrix?"
"204987124-0-69704";"Don't all Daedra serve a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-69705";"You don't serve a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-69709";"So you're actually hoping to meet a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-69710";"So you're actually hoping to meet a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-69712";"What's the House of Troubles?"
"204987124-0-69714";"You mentioned Ordinators and the Tribunal. It sounds like you aren't telling me everything."
"204987124-0-69715";"I'd like a blessing."
"204987124-0-69737";"Could I join you?"
"204987124-0-69744";"What else can you tell me about the ritual?"
"204987124-0-69746";"Do you always track down missing shipments?"
"204987124-0-69752";"All right. Why aren't you coming?"
"204987124-0-69753";"Doesn't anyone get upset when you heal the people they want poisoned?"
"204987124-0-69754";"What if the Bladebearers are allied with the Order of the Waking Flame?"
"204987124-0-69755";"Are you and Rynkyus friends?"
"204987124-0-69756";"What if we used the stones to free one of the spirits? You still need to get back."
"204987124-0-69759";"So, what do you do when they go missing?"
"204987124-0-69760";"I've never heard of you."
"204987124-0-69762";"When was your last battle?"
"204987124-0-69763";"How do you get ingredients?"
"204987124-0-69765";"Sounds like you don't mind when they get out of hand."
"204987124-0-69766";"How did the town get its name?"
"204987124-0-69768";"Why are you outside of town?"
"204987124-0-69769";"What about the mortal smiths?"
"204987124-0-69770";"Llivas Gadar told me you might need help finding the culprit."
"204987124-0-69772";"I'll join your search for the culprit."
"204987124-0-69774";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-69780";"All right, let's give it a try."
"204987124-0-69781";"If he leads the council, why does he let you stay?"
"204987124-0-69783";"Then, what were they negotiating?"
"204987124-0-69784";"And Daedra in Fargrave know the rules?"
"204987124-0-69785";"You said something about gaps in the rules?"
"204987124-0-69786";"What's the Grasp?"
"204987124-0-69789";"You seem very hopeful."
"204987124-0-69790";"So you're definitely going back to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-69791";"So you're definitely going back to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-69792";"So you're definitely going back to Mournhold?"
"204987124-0-69794";"The Eleventh Force?"
"204987124-0-69795";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69796";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-69798";"You seem to be at ease with your current predicament."
"204987124-0-69799";"I'll talk to her."
"204987124-0-69804";"I'll bring you your sword."
"204987124-0-69805";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-69806";"Rynkyus was sending his Bladebearers to scour the Deadlands for Sister Celdina."
"204987124-0-69807";"I'll speak to Rynkyus about finding Deadlight and the cult's stronghold."
"204987124-0-69809";"What will you do with Tarvyn?"
"204987124-0-69812";"Do you know who could have poisoned Tephilaz?"
"204987124-0-69814";"I met your son."
"204987124-0-69815";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69816";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-69817";"What were you saying about the arcane matrices when I arrived? I missed it."
"204987124-0-69821";"You need to return to Wretched Spire with me and take responsibility for your actions."
"204987124-0-69833";"But why are you in Leyawiin?"
"204987124-0-69835";"Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-69837";"Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-69839";"Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-69840";"You heard Ordinator Nilera fight Dagon?"
"204987124-0-69841";"Do you know where the statues are?"
"204987124-0-69843";"Tell me more about Ordinator Nilera."
"204987124-0-69844";"Now that we know where the statues are, what is the next step?"
"204987124-0-69845";"Now that we know where the statues are, what is the next step?"
"204987124-0-69846";"Now that we know where the statues are, what is the next step?"
"204987124-0-69849";"Why do you think the Hexos vault is in the warehouse you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-69850";"Why don't you pick it up?"
"204987124-0-69852";"All right. What's the short answer?"
"204987124-0-69853";"Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-69854";"Is that why your body is gone?"
"204987124-0-69855";"You're the Ritemaster now, you need to be more careful."
"204987124-0-69856";"How did you wind up like this?"
"204987124-0-69857";"What are the Old Ways?"
"204987124-0-69858";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-69859";"Why did you hire Robhir?"
"204987124-0-69863";"So how do you know about these daises?"
"204987124-0-69866";"So all you care about is vengeance?"
"204987124-0-69869";"Do you really think we have a chance then?"
"204987124-0-69870";"You think the twisted rod is important?"
"204987124-0-69871";"Tell me about Fargrave culture."
"204987124-0-69876";"What kind of fish can you catch in lava?"
"204987124-0-69877";"Where can we get one?"
"204987124-0-69879";"I'll meet you out there."
"204987124-0-69880";"Why would Telofasa make this delivery harder for herself?"
"204987124-0-69881";"Was Robhir the only one you sent after the planestone?"
"204987124-0-69882";"Why did you hire Robhir?"
"204987124-0-69883";"So, you don't get bored?"
"204987124-0-69884";"How are you stagnant?"
"204987124-0-69885";"Daedra get bored?"
"204987124-0-69886";"Why did you hire Robhir?"
"204987124-0-69887";"What's reforming like?"
"204987124-0-69888";"What are the cycles?"
"204987124-0-69891";"Who said you had to live up to their example?"
"204987124-0-69892";"But you're still going to save them."
"204987124-0-69894";"What did Ordinator Nilera do?"
"204987124-0-69895";"Who said you had to live up to Ordinator Nilera and Priestess Sovisa's example?"
"204987124-0-69896";"Who said you had to live up to Ordinator Nilera and Priestess Sovisa's example?"
"204987124-0-69899";"Have they ever stolen something like this before?"
"204987124-0-69900";"You said they fled to the Sever?"
"204987124-0-69904";"So, you summoned someone to arbitrate?"
"204987124-0-69905";"The Grasp?"
"204987124-0-69907";"You don't think providing a dead mortal is unfair?"
"204987124-0-69909";"Why did you say he involves the Grasp at his own peril?"
"204987124-0-69910";"How will you resolve the argument?"
"204987124-0-69911";"I guess so."
"204987124-0-69912";"So, how do you plan to assess its value?"
"204987124-0-69915";"Well, it might have some value."
"204987124-0-69916";"A corpse is not worthy compensation."
"204987124-0-69917";"What kind of punishment?"
"204987124-0-69919";"He says your servant tried to bite him."
"204987124-0-69921";"The Grasp might see it differently."
"204987124-0-69924";"What are the options for punishment?"
"204987124-0-69925";"Are there no other options?"
"204987124-0-69930";"But it was a zombie. It could barely do anything."
"204987124-0-69931";"What if the mortal replaced the Dremora's servant?"
"204987124-0-69932";"So, what happens now?"
"204987124-0-69935";"So the mortal that did this hasn't committed a crime?"
"204987124-0-69937";"So, if Kaluzan returns he can call on the Grasp then?"
"204987124-0-69938";"You could tell us where to find Master Rrvenk."
"204987124-0-69939";"You're going to wait centuries for some shade?"
"204987124-0-69940";"How can Shiro-dar help us find Master Rrvenk?"
"204987124-0-69943";"And how does someone become an official member of the Gleaners?"
"204987124-0-69945";"We've been here before."
"204987124-0-69947";"How am I supposed to do that?"
"204987124-0-69948";"We've been in this room before. All of this has already happened."
"204987124-0-69950";"You're going to betray us."
"204987124-0-69951";"Yes. Skrix sprung a trap on us."
"204987124-0-69952";"Any ideas?"
"204987124-0-69954";"Understood."
"204987124-0-69955";"Understood."
"204987124-0-69956";"How can she do that?"
"204987124-0-69957";"How is it I understand you?"
"204987124-0-69961";"What's the Grasp?"
"204987124-0-69962";"I found the Redmaiden. Here, take it."
"204987124-0-69963";"So, which is it going to be?"
"204987124-0-69964";"Are you expecting to be attacked?"
"204987124-0-69966";"Do you think you can stop an attacking force?"
"204987124-0-69967";"I'll pick up the remaining Mother Stones."
"204987124-0-69969";"You're not going to stop, are you?"
"204987124-0-69970";"Perhaps. What would I do at the altar?"
"204987124-0-69971";"We attuned the Mother Stones, what next?"
"204987124-0-69972";"How did you wind up like this?"
"204987124-0-69973";"What can you tell me about Rrvenk?"
"204987124-0-69974";"Then what did you do?"
"204987124-0-69975";"How did the attack start?"
"204987124-0-69976";"What happened to Burzonash and Uroga?"
"204987124-0-69977";"How did you survive?"
"204987124-0-69978";"How did you become a wise woman?"
"204987124-0-69979";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-69980";"You mentioned the thieves stole Redmaiden? What's that?"
"204987124-0-69981";"What do you know about this place?"
"204987124-0-69982";"And what about Initiate Tilgo?"
"204987124-0-69983";"Does your tale include an explanation about the mask you're wearing?"
"204987124-0-69984";"You said the votive rune affects mortals. Is that what made our hands glow?"
"204987124-0-69985";"The Plaza of Portals? The Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-69986";"And where can I find Madam Whim and Initiate Tilgo?"
"204987124-0-69987";"The Anchorite. That's an unusual name."
"204987124-0-69989";"Why are you a prisoner?"
"204987124-0-69991";"What's the Stricture?"
"204987124-0-69992";"What was your loophole?"
"204987124-0-69994";"What's going to happen to you after the review?"
"204987124-0-69995";"Tell me more about these Dagonists."
"204987124-0-69996";"Your charges?"
"204987124-0-69997";"I didn't hear about Mehrunes Dagon attacking Mournhold a few years ago."
"204987124-0-69998";"And how did Nilera die?"
"204987124-0-69999";"And how did Priest Sovisa die?"
"204987124-0-70000";"How do the Mother Stones get attuned?"
"204987124-0-70001";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-70002";"Why do the Mother Stones need to be attuned to the Sever?"
"204987124-0-70003";"How are the False Martyrs trapped?"
"204987124-0-70004";"How will the Mother Stones free the spirits from the statues?"
"204987124-0-70005";"What's an Ordinator?"
"204987124-0-70006";"How did Nilera die?"
"204987124-0-70007";"You said the Mother Stones would free the spirits?"
"204987124-0-70008";"Selveni, that was nearly six-hundred years ago."
"204987124-0-70009";"What more can you tell me about Ordinator Nilera and Priest Sovisa?"
"204987124-0-70010";"And how did Priest Sovisa die?"
"204987124-0-70012";"I'll get going then."
"204987124-0-70017";"Tell me more about these contacts you want me to talk to."
"204987124-0-70018";"Tell me more about these contacts you want me to talk to."
"204987124-0-70019";"The Grasp?"
"204987124-0-70020";"Tell me more about these contacts you want me to talk to."
"204987124-0-70021";"To a point?"
"204987124-0-70023";"To a point?"
"204987124-0-70024";"The Grasp?"
"204987124-0-70025";"Tell me more about these contacts you want me to talk to."
"204987124-0-70028";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-70030";"What would Mehrunes Dagon want from you?"
"204987124-0-70032";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-70033";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-70034";"Aren't Dremora evil? Why should I help her?"
"204987124-0-70035";"Still serving as Lyranth's messenger, Rogatina?"
"204987124-0-70036";"So, you're basically a glorified messenger?"
"204987124-0-70037";"So the Grasp of the Stricture are sort of the city guard?"
"204987124-0-70038";"But you're not a fighter."
"204987124-0-70040";"That seems like a big job."
"204987124-0-70041";"You're still confusing me with Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-70043";"Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-70045";"Selveni, I'm not Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-70047";"You're suggesting Nokvroz could have altered time itself?"
"204987124-0-70050";"Has your condition remained stable since we parted?"
"204987124-0-70051";"Any idea where I can find Sister Celdina?"
"204987124-0-70052";"A price?"
"204987124-0-70054";"I'll let him know."
"204987124-0-70056";"You mentioned three paths we could take to get to the bathhouse."
"204987124-0-70057";"What do you know about the old bathhouse?"
"204987124-0-70058";"So how do we find this hidden realm called Deadlight?"
"204987124-0-70060";"I still want to know about your name and why you're wearing a mask."
"204987124-0-70061";"What should I know about Boss Kezo and his gang?"
"204987124-0-70062";"What are the Spiderkith?"
"204987124-0-70063";"What should I know about Boss Kezo and his gang?"
"204987124-0-70064";"Make use of their energy? How exactly?"
"204987124-0-70066";"What's the purpose of the dynamus font?"
"204987124-0-70067";"Dynamism?"
"204987124-0-70069";"Can't we just break the crystal to release the energy?"
"204987124-0-70072";"How was your time with Master Rrvenk?"
"204987124-0-70073";"Is that strange?"
"204987124-0-70074";"Has your condition remained stable since we parted?"
"204987124-0-70075";"Can you tell me more about the lucent?"
"204987124-0-70076";"Can you tell me more about the lucent?"
"204987124-0-70077";"Who is Vares?"
"204987124-0-70078";"Who are the Saraathu Tong?"
"204987124-0-70080";"What about you? Are you also high ranking?"
"204987124-0-70081";"How long does it take the Unmaker to reform?"
"204987124-0-70082";"Did Master Rrvenk tell you that?"
"204987124-0-70084";"But we stopped Sister Celdina's ritual."
"204987124-0-70085";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-70087";"You think the Waking Flame will try again?"
"204987124-0-70088";"I can ask around, but the Anchorite seems to have a history with Whim. Do you know her?"
"204987124-0-70089";"I'll take the encoded note to Madam Whim."
"204987124-0-70091";"You killed him?"
"204987124-0-70092";"Did you learn anything from him at least?"
"204987124-0-70093";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-70095";"That sounds a little ominous."
"204987124-0-70097";"You know about the Dwarves?"
"204987124-0-70099";"So how did you wind up in Madam Whim's service?"
"204987124-0-70100";"Hop in my pack, Arox."
"204987124-0-70101";"So Sister Celdina wants to conquer Fargrave so Dagon can use its portals?"
"204987124-0-70102";"Tell me more about Wretched Spire."
"204987124-0-70103";"Why can't you explore the wilds yourself?"
"204987124-0-70105";"Sure. I can explore the wilds and bring back some details for your brochure."
"204987124-0-70106";"Maybe. Can you remind me what you need done?"
"204987124-0-70108";"All right, I'll gather some information on Summerset, Vvardenfell, and Clockwork City."
"204987124-0-70109";"What does that have to do with your synchroseisia?"
"204987124-0-70110";"Is that why your body is gone?"
"204987124-0-70111";"What do you have against us?"
"204987124-0-70113";"Why did you hire Shiro-dar, anyway?"
"204987124-0-70114";"There's still more for you to learn?"
"204987124-0-70115";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-70116";"There's still more for you to learn?"
"204987124-0-70118";"Can all Banekin do this?"
"204987124-0-70119";"How so?"
"204987124-0-70120";"Can you help Valsirenn?"
"204987124-0-70121";"I thought only Psijics called it the Eleventh Force."
"204987124-0-70122";"How is it I understand you?"
"204987124-0-70123";"You don't trust Lyranth?"
"204987124-0-70132";"Tell me more about Wretched Spire."
"204987124-0-70133";"Why are you outside of town?"
"204987124-0-70135";"I thought Dremora can't die."
"204987124-0-70138";"How do I assist Miksotet's ritual?"
"204987124-0-70141";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-70142";"It's shriveled and decayed."
"204987124-0-70144";"You're not going to hurt her, are you?"
"204987124-0-70145";"At Fort Grief, Sister Celdina and Valkynaz Nokvroz had some sort of falling out."
"204987124-0-70146";"Arox does think the rod is important."
"204987124-0-70147";"At Fort Grief, Sister Celdina and Valkynaz Nokvroz had some sort of falling out."
"204987124-0-70148";"She's the daughter of Emperor Moricar and Sister Celdina. Her name is Mairead."
"204987124-0-70149";"Does this change your plan to find it?"
"204987124-0-70150";"How do you know about blood magic?"
"204987124-0-70151";"Arox would owe you a big favor if you succeeded."
"204987124-0-70152";"Mehrunes Dagon seemed interested in the Anchorite. This might not be over yet."
"204987124-0-70154";"How do you talk to Atrozu?"
"204987124-0-70155";"You seemed concerned that the Ravener spoke. What does it matter?"
"204987124-0-70156";"Do you really think we have a chance then?"
"204987124-0-70166";"So the prayer itself isn't necessary?"
"204987124-0-70167";"So we sacrifice Arox's long-term restoration to use his power right now?"
"204987124-0-70168";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-70170";"So what do we do with the Mother Stones now that one's broken?"
"204987124-0-70171";"Do you know what the cult's doing in the Brandfire Reformatory?"
"204987124-0-70173";"I'll search the Brandfire Reformatory for Pibiha."
"204987124-0-70175";"I think you have me confused with someone else."
"204987124-0-70177";"I'll help you free Ordinator Nilera and Priest Sovisa from the False Martyrs' Folly."
"204987124-0-70178";"I found this note by some Orc bodies."
"204987124-0-70180";"I'll join you in Ardent Hope and help destroy the Ravener."
"204987124-0-70182";"Did Gazmod the Collector tell you anything about your mask?"
"204987124-0-70183";"Do I want to know what you did at the Blood Pit before you were a daedrat?"
"204987124-0-70184";"The Riven Cataclyst was fueled by Dremora essence. Why would the Perfected Cataclyst need blood?"
"204987124-0-70185";"What do you know about the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-70189";"What do you hope Eveli can turn up by searching through the Longhouse documents?"
"204987124-0-70190";"How do we find Sombren and Calia? Do you know where they are?"
"204987124-0-70191";"How do we find Sombren and Calia? Do you know where they are?"
"204987124-0-70192";"How did Lyranth contact you?"
"204987124-0-70193";"Did Lyranth tell you what happened in Fargrave and the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-70194";"How do you make baked apples?"
"204987124-0-70197";"Where can I find the ingredients for baked apples?"
"204987124-0-70198";"You want me to gather wood for you?"
"204987124-0-70199";"Trade for the wood?"
"204987124-0-70200";"Who stole the idol?"
"204987124-0-70201";"Tell me more about these knights first."
"204987124-0-70202";"I'll gather the wood you need to weave a basket."
"204987124-0-70203";"I'll find the knights and retrieve the idol."
"204987124-0-70205";"Is that sort of weather common here?"
"204987124-0-70207";"Do you think that's why the knights attacked the lighthouse?"
"204987124-0-70208";"How do you make baked apples?"
"204987124-0-70209";"Where should we look next?"
"204987124-0-70210";"Tell me about the Knights of Death's Valor."
"204987124-0-70211";"Why can't you take the items from the altars?"
"204987124-0-70213";"I'll kneel at the altars within the Death's Valor Keep and take the tools of Leobert's ritual."
"204987124-0-70217";"Is this true? Is the Anchorite really the Fourth Ambition?"
"204987124-0-70219";"The other Ambitions? Where?"
"204987124-0-70220";"Is that why you're out here?"
"204987124-0-70222";"A new order of knights?"
"204987124-0-70223";"What who wants?"
"204987124-0-70225";"Tell me about these robber-knights."
"204987124-0-70227";"Where did the knights take the other salvagers?"
"204987124-0-70228";"Interesting. Speaking of rumors, have you heard anything about a trio of missing ships?"
"204987124-0-70231";"Why will the scoria piles be around the lava vents?"
"204987124-0-70232";"If she's run off into danger before, why are you so worried?"
"204987124-0-70233";"Is the scoria dangerous?"
"204987124-0-70234";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-70235";"They're known as the Ascendant Order. The inn's patrons said they attacked caravans inland."
"204987124-0-70236";"And you think the scoria will change merchants' minds?"
"204987124-0-70239";"Someone called the Ascendant Magus recruited salvagers to capture shipwreck survivors."
"204987124-0-70242";"How bad are Tarrinore's wounds?"
"204987124-0-70243";"Are they a serious threat?"
"204987124-0-70244";"Do you think that the Hadolids will try to take her again?"
"204987124-0-70245";"And what about the Fighters Guild delegate?"
"204987124-0-70246";"Emperor Moricar suggested there was a way to defeat Mehrunes Dagon using the Ambitions."
"204987124-0-70247";"You know the Ascendant Order? What else can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-70249";"Where did you send them?"
"204987124-0-70250";"Are druids common on High Isle?"
"204987124-0-70251";"Jakarn and I have dealt with them before."
"204987124-0-70252";"What happened to it?"
"204987124-0-70253";"Was Guild General Quentyn injured?"
"204987124-0-70254";"Where did the Ascendant Order take Jakarn's friend?"
"204987124-0-70256";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-70257";"Lady Arabelle sent me to warn you that the Ascendant Order was targeting conference delegates."
"204987124-0-70259";"Do you think the Ascendant Order followed you out here?"
"204987124-0-70260";"You want me to gather other adventurers?"
"204987124-0-70262";"Tarazka followed them inside. He left a lantern near the opening they disappeared into."
"204987124-0-70266";"I'll keep an eye out. Let's go."
"204987124-0-70268";"If all of the delegates have a medallion, can you use them to find the missing ships?"
"204987124-0-70269";"Should we head directly to the abandoned crypts you saw?"
"204987124-0-70270";"What do you know about the Order of the Iron Knot?"
"204987124-0-70272";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-70277";"What are you thinking, Valessea?"
"204987124-0-70278";"Mind if I ask you about the delegates that were aboard the missing ships?"
"204987124-0-70279";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-70280";"What kind of conference is Lord Bacaro holding, exactly?"
"204987124-0-70286";"What can you tell me about the Order of the Albatross?"
"204987124-0-70287";"Is our trial a poem?"
"204987124-0-70289";"Do we talk to the mage, or fight them?"
"204987124-0-70290";"Tell me about the Oaken Order."
"204987124-0-70292";"Where was the sword lost?"
"204987124-0-70293";"What can you tell me about the Order of the Albatross?"
"204987124-0-70295";"How will we find Sombren then?"
"204987124-0-70296";"So what do you think an egonymic is?"
"204987124-0-70297";"How did he take Calia's powers from her?"
"204987124-0-70298";"Do you know where Jakarn was going first?"
"204987124-0-70301";"And you need to steal a staff from him?"
"204987124-0-70302";"All right, let's find this wizard."
"204987124-0-70306";"I need your help, Lyranth."
"204987124-0-70307";"Where did Jakarn and Valessea take the captains?"
"204987124-0-70308";"I'll meet you in Gonfalon Bay."
"204987124-0-70309";"Why is it called Mandrake Manor?"
"204987124-0-70313";"What happened to Prince Irnskar?"
"204987124-0-70316";"Back up. What happened before you washed ashore?"
"204987124-0-70318";"Do you know where High King Emeric and the other leaders are now?"
"204987124-0-70319";"You were fished out of the water by the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-70321";"What about Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-70323";"Where did they take the medallions?"
"204987124-0-70324";"I'll find the medallions."
"204987124-0-70327";"Tell me about the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-70328";"Like the storm Lord Bacaro mentioned?"
"204987124-0-70329";"Tell me about the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-70330";"Tell me about the Loch Abhain Shallows."
"204987124-0-70331";"What's the purpose of this conference?"
"204987124-0-70332";"Tell me more about the locations you want me to investigate."
"204987124-0-70333";"What happens if your missing ships don't turn up?"
"204987124-0-70335";"What's so special about these particular ships?"
"204987124-0-70336";"And you don't share Lady Arabelle's concerns?"
"204987124-0-70337";"Tell me more about the Society of the Steadfast."
"204987124-0-70339";"Treacherous? How so?"
"204987124-0-70341";"Lord Bacaro mentioned a powerful storm."
"204987124-0-70342";"How have you been, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-70343";"You certainly lead an interesting life."
"204987124-0-70344";"What's this about a debt to Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-70345";"Your eyes and ears?"
"204987124-0-70347";"All right. I'm willing to help."
"204987124-0-70348";"Your eyes and ears?"
"204987124-0-70350";"All right. I'm willing to help."
"204987124-0-70355";"What kind of resistance do you think we'll run into?"
"204987124-0-70356";"I'll meet you in the grotto."
"204987124-0-70359";"How did she bring the barriers down in the story?"
"204987124-0-70361";"You got it. A heron's feather, cat's paw flowers, and a spriggan's veil."
"204987124-0-70362";"Lady Arabelle's an author?"
"204987124-0-70363";"Tell me about your partner."
"204987124-0-70365";"Where do we find Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-70369";"Tell me about your partner."
"204987124-0-70370";"Tell me about your partner."
"204987124-0-70372";"What do you do for the Daggerfall Covenant?"
"204987124-0-70378";"We've completed all three trials, Isobel. What now?"
"204987124-0-70381";"Is our trial a poem?"
"204987124-0-70384";"What do you know about the Order of the Iron Knot?"
"204987124-0-70386";"Where was the sword lost?"
"204987124-0-70387";"What can you tell me about the Order of the Albatross?"
"204987124-0-70390";"And what about you? Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-70391";"What do you do for the Daggerfall Covenant?"
"204987124-0-70392";"Is he going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-70393";"Is he going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-70397";"Is he going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-70398";"What did the Commodore do?"
"204987124-0-70401";"The medallion is dangerous. What did you do with it?"
"204987124-0-70402";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-70403";"How can I free you?"
"204987124-0-70404";"What does it taste like?"
"204987124-0-70407";"Someone tampered with the medallions, but I can dispel the dangerous magic."
"204987124-0-70408";"How so?"
"204987124-0-70409";"Tell me about the Oaken Order."
"204987124-0-70412";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-70415";"Where was the sword lost?"
"204987124-0-70416";"What do you know about the Order of the Iron Knot?"
"204987124-0-70417";"Do we talk to the mage, or fight them?"
"204987124-0-70418";"Tell me about the Oaken Order."
"204987124-0-70419";"I need to find him. Do you know where Jakarn was headed next?"
"204987124-0-70421";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-70422";"We've completed all three trials, Isobel. What now?"
"204987124-0-70424";"I'll head to the Skywatch docks and find Jakarn."
"204987124-0-70428";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-70429";"Is our trial a poem?"
"204987124-0-70430";"What can you tell me about the Order of the Albatross?"
"204987124-0-70431";"Do we talk to the mage, or fight them?"
"204987124-0-70432";"Tell me about the Oaken Order."
"204987124-0-70433";"You said the reward was freedom?"
"204987124-0-70434";"Would you mind if we took your staff?"
"204987124-0-70435";"Thank you, Erlibru."
"204987124-0-70436";"The paper mentioned a stage at the northern tip."
"204987124-0-70439";"Yes. And you were right to be worried about their leader."
"204987124-0-70440";"It's done?"
"204987124-0-70442";"How will we get to the island?"
"204987124-0-70443";"All right, I'll meet you at the Dufort Docks."
"204987124-0-70444";"flv 2"
"204987124-0-70445";"fl3"
"204987124-0-70446";"fl2"
"204987124-0-70447";"A low profile? Why's that?"
"204987124-0-70448";"So Amenos Station is a town?"
"204987124-0-70449";"Right. And the Ascendant Magus summoned a storm to sink their ships before they reached High Isle."
"204987124-0-70450";"No lockpicking, got it. Is there another key somewhere?"
"204987124-0-70451";"So you'll get us to Amenos?"
"204987124-0-70452";"Why do we need disguises?"
"204987124-0-70453";"Gangs of banished?"
"204987124-0-70454";"I'll meet you back here, then."
"204987124-0-70455";"I took care of it. Valessea made a powder to dispel the magic. I have it right here."
"204987124-0-70457";"Do you think all the jailers are involved?"
"204987124-0-70461";"Well. Good luck in there. We're heading into the catacombs."
"204987124-0-70462";"Let me untie you."
"204987124-0-70465";"All right, we'll find your sword in exchange for the key."
"204987124-0-70468";"Why do you think they know we restored some of the medallions?"
"204987124-0-70470";"Tell me where to find Lady Arabelle and the medallion."
"204987124-0-70471";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-70473";"I'm sure Isobel won't say a word."
"204987124-0-70474";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-70476";"Thanks, Aurelia."
"204987124-0-70477";"He said he'd give me a key to the catacombs if you read his note."
"204987124-0-70478";"I'm a peasant with a surprisingly full coin purse."
"204987124-0-70479";"What's the favor?"
"204987124-0-70480";"I need the key to the catacombs."
"204987124-0-70481";"Can't the commander just admit she made a mistake?"
"204987124-0-70482";"Isobel and I are trying to enter the catacombs. But we can't find a key."
"204987124-0-70483";"Surely for her daughter she could make an exception?"
"204987124-0-70486";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-70488";"I'll … go deliver the poem then."
"204987124-0-70490";"Great. Thanks for the key."
"204987124-0-70491";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-70492";"What sort of tasks does Fasaria offer?"
"204987124-0-70493";"What else is there to do?"
"204987124-0-70494";"What else is there to do?"
"204987124-0-70498";"I don't want to pray to Zenithar."
"204987124-0-70499";"Sounds dangerous. How did she convince you to do that?"
"204987124-0-70503";"You knew about this place? Why did we need to look it up in a book?"
"204987124-0-70505";"Sounds good, I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-70506";"There's another way up?"
"204987124-0-70508";"Sounds good. Let's go."
"204987124-0-70509";"They have a death spell on them. It killed Delric, but Valessea made this powder to dispel it."
"204987124-0-70511";"How can we stop the Ascendant Champion?"
"204987124-0-70512";"You're reciting a poem?"
"204987124-0-70514";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-70517";"You think that's related to the three alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-70519";"Once I find the alliance leaders, how do I get off this island?"
"204987124-0-70524";"What challenges do I face?"
"204987124-0-70525";"Where do we go from here?"
"204987124-0-70526";"Why would anyone want to keep the war going?"
"204987124-0-70528";"Do you think anyone else is secretly working for the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-70530";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-70531";"You'd think a group that claims to want to end the war would want the peace talks to proceed."
"204987124-0-70532";"Do you think Dockmaster Arnauld knows where the alliance leaders are?"
"204987124-0-70533";"Did the druids use their magic on Veslyn too?"
"204987124-0-70534";"Before you go, I have more questions about what's going on here."
"204987124-0-70535";"Why would I destroy the coral?"
"204987124-0-70536";"Yaghra could mean the Abyssal Cabal is involved."
"204987124-0-70539";"I'll meet you back at your camp in Vvardenfell."
"204987124-0-70542";"Yes, this is the prison island. I came to find you and the three alliance leaders."
"204987124-0-70543";"We could search for the queen and the others together."
"204987124-0-70544";"Where were your retainers headed?"
"204987124-0-70546";"I'll look for your missing retainers."
"204987124-0-70547";"I'm not sure I follow?"
"204987124-0-70549";"You're very welcome."
"204987124-0-70554";"Why can't we recruit regular minstrels?"
"204987124-0-70562";"Grenier wrote this note before he died. He tried to fight back."
"204987124-0-70563";"All right. I'll meet you at Castle Navire."
"204987124-0-70564";"We suspect a wealthy noble may be funding the Ascendant Order."
"204987124-0-70566";"Lady Arabelle mentioned that some of the nobles opposed the peace talks."
"204987124-0-70569";"Why can't you restore the wards yourself?"
"204987124-0-70570";"I'll proceed to the next trial."
"204987124-0-70571";"What will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-70572";"How many of these celebrations have you actually been invited to?"
"204987124-0-70574";"Tell me more about the Society of the Steadfast."
"204987124-0-70575";"What does the Society do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-70578";"Why is Duchess Elea holding the banquet without the guests of honor?"
"204987124-0-70579";"Do you suspect them?"
"204987124-0-70580";"Who are Elea Dufort, Damard Dufort, and Jonne Mornard?"
"204987124-0-70581";"The duchess told me about her investigation. What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-70583";"What sort of distraction?"
"204987124-0-70585";"Would this buy me a song?"
"204987124-0-70586";"All right. I'll deliver the letter to Layla. Which one is she?"
"204987124-0-70588";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-70590";"I can signal a rescue ship as soon as we find High King Emeric and Prince Irnskar."
"204987124-0-70593";"How can you do that?"
"204987124-0-70594";"Where were you when High King Emeric took off on his own?"
"204987124-0-70597";"I can signal a rescue ship as soon as we find Prince Irnskar. And Queen Ayrenn can clear the storm."
"204987124-0-70598";"I did overhear some Green Serpents mention they had captured one of you."
"204987124-0-70599";"All right, I'll look around."
"204987124-0-70600";"Is there anything you can tell me that might help us find the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-70601";"Tell me more about House Mornard."
"204987124-0-70602";"We have reason to believe a High Isle noble may be funding the Ascendant Order."
"204987124-0-70603";"What did High King Emeric do?"
"204987124-0-70604";"Tell me more about House Mornard."
"204987124-0-70605";"Hazardous seas didn't wreck those ships. The Ascendant Order did."
"204987124-0-70606";"There were Breton slave traders?"
"204987124-0-70607";"Why are House Mornard and House Dufort at odds?"
"204987124-0-70608";"You don't seem to think very highly of House Dufort."
"204987124-0-70609";"Yes. We think it might have caused the delegates' ships to crash."
"204987124-0-70610";"You said you're the court mage?"
"204987124-0-70611";"What do the druids have to do with a storm?"
"204987124-0-70612";"Right. We'll meet at the coin fort."
"204987124-0-70613";"We also found the Skald-King's axe."
"204987124-0-70616";"Stagger and Sway, please."
"204987124-0-70617";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-70619";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-70622";"You're suggesting we hand over one of the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-70631";"Here's your father's axe. Come on. Once we reach the shore, I can signal a ship to pick us up."
"204987124-0-70635";"Were you and the other captains in contact?"
"204987124-0-70636";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-70638";"I'll get this information to Lady Arabelle as soon as I can."
"204987124-0-70639";"It also said another druid had unbalanced the True Way."
"204987124-0-70640";"The minstrels will attack? Are you sure they're safe to bring to the Jester's Festival?"
"204987124-0-70641";"Why do we need those specific vintages?"
"204987124-0-70642";"I'll meet you in the Stonelore Grove village."
"204987124-0-70643";"Right. The Ascendant Lord told the Magus to assemble the Order on High Isle."
"204987124-0-70644";"I'll help you investigate Mistmouth Cave."
"204987124-0-70645";"Anyone patrolling the docks?"
"204987124-0-70647";"How should we handle it?"
"204987124-0-70648";"What do you know about the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-70649";"What do you know about the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-70650";"Tell me everything you know."
"204987124-0-70651";"I'll cut you free. Get out of here. Now."
"204987124-0-70652";"Do you know who the Ascendant Magus really is?"
"204987124-0-70661";"The alliance leaders aren't safe here at Mandrake Manor?"
"204987124-0-70662";"So the peace talks will go forward?"
"204987124-0-70663";"Right. The alliance leaders survived and I rescued them from Amenos."
"204987124-0-70664";"I ran into one of the Sea Elves, she said the druids fed the other prisoners to the coral."
"204987124-0-70666";"You saw what they did and you chose to stay?"
"204987124-0-70667";"What about the Evergrowth?"
"204987124-0-70668";"Where did you learn about how Amunara's censer works?"
"204987124-0-70673";"Which are?"
"204987124-0-70676";"Where should I set them?"
"204987124-0-70677";"Were you only experimenting because Magister Irin was away?"
"204987124-0-70678";"You said you grew up in Skywatch?"
"204987124-0-70679";"That must have been difficult for you."
"204987124-0-70680";"So he asked you to be his apprentice?"
"204987124-0-70681";"You don't want to join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-70682";"How did you end up apprenticed to Magister Irin?"
"204987124-0-70683";"Were you only experimenting because Magister Irin was away?"
"204987124-0-70684";"How did you end up apprenticed to Magister Irin?"
"204987124-0-70685";"Tell me more about your mission."
"204987124-0-70686";"Tell me more about your mission."
"204987124-0-70687";"She said she knew this would be her last adventure."
"204987124-0-70689";"Of course, Sir Rayan."
"204987124-0-70690";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-70691";"I'll gather the flowers and a torchbug."
"204987124-0-70692";"Where can I find these reagents?"
"204987124-0-70694";"Where will you go after the festival ends?"
"204987124-0-70695";"What are your skills?"
"204987124-0-70696";"Did you write the Investigator Vale books?"
"204987124-0-70697";"I'm not sure. How does that relate to the ritual?"
"204987124-0-70698";"I will be the first to succeed."
"204987124-0-70699";"I'll leave you to it."
"204987124-0-70700";"I see. What happens now?"
"204987124-0-70701";"Tell me more about the locations you want me to investigate."
"204987124-0-70702";"Why did Lord Bacaro select you for this task?"
"204987124-0-70704";"You mentioned a conference. Tell me about that."
"204987124-0-70705";"What's the Undergrove? And what was that about wards?"
"204987124-0-70708";"Have you made any progress so far?"
"204987124-0-70709";"We also found a summons to come to the hall below the Sleeping Knights."
"204987124-0-70711";"I'll help track down the cause of this affliction."
"204987124-0-70714";"What do you think happened to the knight who received this summons?"
"204987124-0-70715";"Tell me about the guild representatives."
"204987124-0-70716";"What are the vulk'esh?"
"204987124-0-70718";"How do you want us to handle the Ascendant Lord and Magus?"
"204987124-0-70719";"The archdruid also mentioned the Allwither. What is that?"
"204987124-0-70721";"Circles?"
"204987124-0-70723";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-70724";"Tenacity."
"204987124-0-70725";"Love."
"204987124-0-70726";"Understanding."
"204987124-0-70729";"Before, you asked us to get the druids to restore your bindings. Now you want us to break them?"
"204987124-0-70731";"What do we do once we enter the Undergrove?"
"204987124-0-70732";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-70736";"Skill."
"204987124-0-70737";"Skill."
"204987124-0-70738";"Understanding."
"204987124-0-70739";"Understanding."
"204987124-0-70740";"Honor."
"204987124-0-70741";"Love."
"204987124-0-70742";"One of your menders mentioned a potion she was working on. I'd like to look around your dispensary."
"204987124-0-70746";"I won't touch anything. But lives may depend on what Roslenn was working on, too."
"204987124-0-70748";"Any chance one of them has your scepter?"
"204987124-0-70749";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-0-70750";"Roslenn doesn't seem to know either. But she was researching a cure."
"204987124-0-70751";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-70753";"I'll check out the harpy nests."
"204987124-0-70755";"The innkeeper says that no one paid the bill."
"204987124-0-70756";"The healer's note said you drank rotmeth. A lot of it."
"204987124-0-70757";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-70759";"Tell me more about your mission."
"204987124-0-70760";"I'll check out the harpy nests."
"204987124-0-70762";"Why is it so important to remove the illusions from the livestock?"
"204987124-0-70763";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-70764";"Do you think the animals will let me use the Spoon of Undo on them?"
"204987124-0-70765";"Can I ask what you were trying to do with your experimental spell in the first place?"
"204987124-0-70766";"What will Magister Irin do if he returns before we fix everything?"
"204987124-0-70768";"Do you think the animals will let me use the Spoon of Undo on them?"
"204987124-0-70770";"You're pretty high up there."
"204987124-0-70773";"Which Breton?"
"204987124-0-70774";"Meryline said there was something going on in the mine."
"204987124-0-70775";"How much food are we talking about?"
"204987124-0-70776";"How is that?"
"204987124-0-70777";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-70779";"I'll find the missing supply caravan."
"204987124-0-70781";"All right, I'll find you some food from the shore."
"204987124-0-70782";"A couple Sea Elves blew themselves up with kindlepitch, I think."
"204987124-0-70783";"All right. I guess—"
"204987124-0-70785";"All right, I'll speak with Captain Jimila."
"204987124-0-70786";"One of the sites was a druidic ritual circle. We found a lodestone there, too."
"204987124-0-70788";"We located the dockmaster. He told us the Order has moved their search from the Shallows to Amenos."
"204987124-0-70790";"All right, I'll help you search the wreckage."
"204987124-0-70791";"Let's go take a look."
"204987124-0-70793";"Why did Master Healer Viralaine drug Roslenn with your blood?"
"204987124-0-70794";"What does that mean for Mender Roslenn?"
"204987124-0-70796";"Viralaine captured you. He's treating patients with Seraphyne's blood."
"204987124-0-70798";"I'll talk to Seraphyne."
"204987124-0-70799";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-70800";"Do you really think you can cure a Vampire?"
"204987124-0-70801";"Mender Roslenn wants you to confront Master Healer Viralaine with us."
"204987124-0-70805";"Meet us at Steadfast Manor."
"204987124-0-70806";"Will Jakarn be all right?"
"204987124-0-70807";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-70808";"How did you get captured?"
"204987124-0-70809";"We're looking for a letter and medallion, right? Why are the Ascendant Order so interested in them?"
"204987124-0-70812";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-70813";"Where did the Ascendant Order take Jakarn's friend?"
"204987124-0-70814";"Why didn't you go after the Ascendant Order when you saw they had a prisoner?"
"204987124-0-70815";"What's your history with Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-70816";"You think Hadolids did this?"
"204987124-0-70817";"The Hadolids might still be around here."
"204987124-0-70820";"He asked me to see what happened to a medical supply caravan."
"204987124-0-70823";"What else do you know about Stigthar?"
"204987124-0-70825";"If you kill the alliance leaders, how will you achieve peace?"
"204987124-0-70826";"You're Viscount Jonne Mornard."
"204987124-0-70827";"Truth doesn't hide under a helm. Who are you?"
"204987124-0-70828";"Will Oblan be safe with Adwig?"
"204987124-0-70834";"All right, let's go look for the Prowler."
"204987124-0-70835";"You said you bought a special drink for <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-70836";"The Ascendant Order has gathered warships for an attack on All Flags Islet."
"204987124-0-70838";"How'd you know that? We found orders that mentioned he'd take the Silver Swan or the Storm Petrel."
"204987124-0-70839";"Listen, Duchess Elea may be in danger."
"204987124-0-70841";"Count Damard is one of the Order's leaders. Calls himself the Ascendant Magus. Did you know?"
"204987124-0-70842";"Do you know where Count Damard is now?"
"204987124-0-70843";"So what do we do now?"
"204987124-0-70844";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-70845";"Your music scared off the Hadolids?"
"204987124-0-70847";"I'll help you get the book."
"204987124-0-70854";"What does that even mean?"
"204987124-0-70856";"Ready when you are."
"204987124-0-70861";"Are serious threats common in the Systres Isles?"
"204987124-0-70868";"Tell me more about these job brokers and what they're looking for."
"204987124-0-70869";"Any nobles in particular?"
"204987124-0-70871";"How do I destroy the Sable Knight?"
"204987124-0-70875";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-70876";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-70878";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-70879";"What sort of work are you hiring for?"
"204987124-0-70881";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-70884";"What does Vinilsare think of this plan?"
"204987124-0-70886";"You mean to blow it up?"
"204987124-0-70887";"Will your client wait that long?"
"204987124-0-70888";"I'll follow Meryline into the mine."
"204987124-0-70891";"Ember already had an idea of how to fix it before I got here. I just helped."
"204987124-0-70892";"I'll talk to Ember."
"204987124-0-70893";"Don't worry. Do you remember your job?"
"204987124-0-70897";"Right. Let's head to the overlook."
"204987124-0-70899";"Do you have a plan?"
"204987124-0-70902";"What if the song doesn't work?"
"204987124-0-70903";"I'll use the medical supplies to heal the wounded."
"204987124-0-70906";"Overseer Barthel was dragged away in the Hadolid attack, have you seen him?"
"204987124-0-70908";"We'll head deeper into the tunnels."
"204987124-0-70910";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-70911";"You believe Meryline will leave with you?"
"204987124-0-70913";"I'll deal with the Hadolids."
"204987124-0-70915";"What are the vulk'esh?"
"204987124-0-70916";"Do you think the resonance crystals will really get the Hadolids to leave?"
"204987124-0-70917";"What if it doesn't work?"
"204987124-0-70924";"I need to find a thief who was recently imprisoned. Would this gift grant me safe passage?"
"204987124-0-70925";"What do you know about your client?"
"204987124-0-70926";"How do you feel about joining a new crew?"
"204987124-0-70930";"Thanks for the advice and the outfit, jailer."
"204987124-0-70931";"And what's their story?"
"204987124-0-70932";"What were you and Valentyn doing when the jailers arrested him?"
"204987124-0-70933";"If the stockade is the prison, what's the deal with the jungle?"
"204987124-0-70935";"Tell me about the shipwreck, you said you were attacked by coral?"
"204987124-0-70936";"Is transporting Sea Elves particularly dangerous?"
"204987124-0-70937";"How many prisoners were you transporting?"
"204987124-0-70938";"There's a prison stockade on Amenos?"
"204987124-0-70939";"I'll keep that in mind when I search for the Greycloaks."
"204987124-0-70940";"What do you want me to do exactly?"
"204987124-0-70941";"You're trying to frame another prisoner?"
"204987124-0-70943";"Do you have everything you need to complete the offering?"
"204987124-0-70944";"Tell me about the shipwreck, you said you were attacked by coral?"
"204987124-0-70945";"Did any of the prisoners stick out or act suspiciously?"
"204987124-0-70947";"The prisoner's captain paid for their release?"
"204987124-0-70948";"Tell me about the shipwreck, you said you were attacked by coral?"
"204987124-0-70949";"And what's your job for House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-70953";"Who does it represent?"
"204987124-0-70954";"And the branch on the third pillar?"
"204987124-0-70956";"You don't look so good… ."
"204987124-0-70957";"Why can't Zenithar bless another awl?"
"204987124-0-70958";"I'll return the blessed awl to you."
"204987124-0-70959";"I'll return the blessed awl to you."
"204987124-0-70960";"What's the caldera?"
"204987124-0-70962";"I'll unlock the cage."
"204987124-0-70964";"You're stealing the Daybreak Gem from the prison?"
"204987124-0-70966";"All right, I'll help you find the keys and steal the Daybreak Gem."
"204987124-0-70968";"Just like that? <<1>> got into the carriage and drove home?"
"204987124-0-70970";"There must be some way to straighten this out."
"204987124-0-70972";"Seems dangerous for a treasure you aren't sure exists."
"204987124-0-70974";"I'll see what I can do."
"204987124-0-70976";"How will the Sea Elves' captain react to only getting three sailors back?"
"204987124-0-70977";"What will House Mornard do with you and Veslyn?"
"204987124-0-70978";"How will the Sea Elves' captain react to only getting three sailors back?"
"204987124-0-70979";"What will house Mornard do about the Eldertide Druids?"
"204987124-0-70980";"So you take care of more than just Privette?"
"204987124-0-70981";"What do they smell like?"
"204987124-0-70983";"I want to hear more about Privette."
"204987124-0-70984";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-70985";"We'll find the prince."
"204987124-0-70986";"So what happened to Prince Irnskar?"
"204987124-0-70988";"I am."
"204987124-0-70989";"Sea Mages?"
"204987124-0-70992";"<Enter Dreadsail Reef.>"
"204987124-0-71001";"Was the medallion at Coral Aerie an invitation, too?"
"204987124-0-71003";"Tell me about Valessea."
"204987124-0-71004";"Wait, you've only met Valessea twice?"
"204987124-0-71005";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-71006";"So now we go to Amenos?"
"204987124-0-71007";"There's no law and order on Amenos?"
"204987124-0-71008";"What's the Society of the Steadfast?"
"204987124-0-71011";"Do you know why the Ascendant Order wants them?"
"204987124-0-71013";"Where do we get a ship like that?"
"204987124-0-71014";"Sure, I'll help you steal a ship and sail to All Flags Islet."
"204987124-0-71015";"How did they learn the location of the secret peace talks?"
"204987124-0-71016";"Where did the Ascendant Order get warships?"
"204987124-0-71017";"You said it could be defended against an attack?"
"204987124-0-71020";"Tell me more about House Dufort."
"204987124-0-71022";"Do you know anything about the Ascendant Champion?"
"204987124-0-71023";"But Valentyn is your husband. Why not just share the treasure like he wanted to?"
"204987124-0-71029";"Cut the mooring lines. Got it."
"204987124-0-71031";"So you think she left the gem behind? All right. Oh, and here's your hammer and chisel back."
"204987124-0-71033";"Why did you call yourselves the knights of Death's Valor?"
"204987124-0-71037";"While I locate the alliance leaders, what will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-71040";"How did you get to the graveyard?"
"204987124-0-71041";"Why do you blame yourself?"
"204987124-0-71042";"Did any of Lord Bacaro's reinforcements ever reach All Flags Islet?"
"204987124-0-71043";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-71044";"Do you think any of the alliance leaders will refuse the invitation?"
"204987124-0-71049";"Where can I find the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-71052";"Lady Arabelle has secured them in Gonfalon Bay."
"204987124-0-71053";"The Ascendant Magus's magic broke through the wards. He almost toppled the entire castle."
"204987124-0-71055";"I'll tell Lady Arabelle about your plans."
"204987124-0-71056";"Tell me about Jhaka."
"204987124-0-71057";"The celebration's being held at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71058";"Um, Queen Ayrenn and High King Emeric both pledged to attend the celebration at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71059";"Um, sure. Well, for you and the other alliance leaders. It will be held at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71060";"How so?"
"204987124-0-71062";"I'll see you at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71064";"See you at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71066";"I'll see you at Gonfalon Palace."
"204987124-0-71067";"What did you talk about, then?"
"204987124-0-71068";"So you plan to stick around and wait for the peace talks to resume?"
"204987124-0-71069";"At least Count Damard can't threaten you again."
"204987124-0-71071";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-71072";"Tell me about Jhaka."
"204987124-0-71073";"Tell me about Silverslip."
"204987124-0-71074";"Right. And what am I supposed to do with this hammer and chisel?"
"204987124-0-71075";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-71079";"Why would Jhaka be in Sadrith Mora?"
"204987124-0-71080";"How can you be so sure?"
"204987124-0-71081";"Thanks for the information. Ember and I will investigate this."
"204987124-0-71084";"Do you think you'll ever be able to pass on?"
"204987124-0-71089";"If it really is Jhaka, do you think the Telvanni are going to give us trouble if we try to free him?"
"204987124-0-71090";"You don't have a high opinion of Dark Elves, do you?"
"204987124-0-71091";"Can you keep your temper in check while we investigate?"
"204987124-0-71092";"You were a part of this. It's your celebration, too."
"204987124-0-71093";"So, no more jobs for Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-71094";"Did you get into a lot of tavern brawls?"
"204987124-0-71095";"Are you worried about Jhaka being in a fighting pit?"
"204987124-0-71097";"Can you keep your temper in check while we investigate?"
"204987124-0-71099";"But what if the Telvanni assume you are a slave, with me?"
"204987124-0-71100";"Did you get into a lot of tavern brawls?"
"204987124-0-71101";"Are you worried about Jhaka being in a fighting pit?"
"204987124-0-71104";"But what if the Telvanni assume you are a slave, with me?"
"204987124-0-71106";"Good luck, Jakarn. I'll go speak with Lady Arabelle."
"204987124-0-71108";"Do you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-71109";"Can you keep the alliance leaders here until everything is ready?"
"204987124-0-71110";"Do you think Prince Irnskar and High King Emeric feel the same?"
"204987124-0-71111";"And will you follow it?"
"204987124-0-71112";"You don't have to listen to the people who tell you to keep fighting, do you?"
"204987124-0-71113";"Is she right about you being too stubborn to leave without all the scoria?"
"204987124-0-71116";"What do you want me to do?"
"204987124-0-71117";"How did you hurt your leg?"
"204987124-0-71118";"Do you need any more help?"
"204987124-0-71120";"I'll take your enchanted spoon and help the livestock. You go work on your counterspell."
"204987124-0-71121";"I'll find Prince Irnskar and meet you at Memorial Hall."
"204987124-0-71125";"Anything worth mentioning?"
"204987124-0-71126";"All right, I'll take care of the Ascendant Order knights assaulting the battlements."
"204987124-0-71128";"Tell me more about these medallions."
"204987124-0-71132";"You're going to what?"
"204987124-0-71134";"All right, we can try it."
"204987124-0-71135";"Where can we find these bandits?"
"204987124-0-71137";"Let's just get the information we need and get out of here."
"204987124-0-71139";"Let's go find Jhaka."
"204987124-0-71142";"Let's get you out of here and then we can talk more."
"204987124-0-71144";"What was strange?"
"204987124-0-71146";"Can you remember anything else? Ember wants to track down Song and Silverslip too."
"204987124-0-71147";"So you'll let Ulgonash go free?"
"204987124-0-71148";"I'll tell him."
"204987124-0-71149";"Are you willing to pay your share of the bill to the innkeeper?"
"204987124-0-71151";"You don't know anything about his past before you met him? What about the other two?"
"204987124-0-71153";"Remind me what we're doing."
"204987124-0-71154";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-71155";"What can you tell me about Guruz?"
"204987124-0-71157";"Ember and I will head to Betnikh and look for Guruz."
"204987124-0-71158";"Kestrin's Blades did a job in Skywatch. You grabbed three people, a Pahmar and two young women."
"204987124-0-71159";"Do you know what the group wanted with the Redguard?"
"204987124-0-71160";"You mentioned the letter in your journal."
"204987124-0-71161";"Player 2"
"204987124-0-71163";"Thanks a lot."
"204987124-0-71165";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-71167";"I'm sure Ember would welcome your help."
"204987124-0-71169";"Player done"
"204987124-0-71170";"I'm still not sure what happened here."
"204987124-0-71171";"More confused? How?"
"204987124-0-71174";"You mentioned the druids have something to do with the volcano?"
"204987124-0-71175";"What happened with Anton and Olivya?"
"204987124-0-71177";"You didn't know it was a festival for Zenithar?"
"204987124-0-71179";"How are you dealing with Verandis being gone?"
"204987124-0-71180";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-71182";"Why did you keep drinking the rotmeth?"
"204987124-0-71184";"Why did the guard stop you?"
"204987124-0-71186";"Here's your scepter, Rigurt."
"204987124-0-71188";"Let's find the caravan."
"204987124-0-71189";"One problem. Neither Jakarn nor I look like Ascendant Order knights."
"204987124-0-71191";"I'll look for the medical supplies."
"204987124-0-71192";"What if the Hadolids come back?"
"204987124-0-71193";"So what do you need from us?"
"204987124-0-71194";"You want us to talk to this estranged uncle?"
"204987124-0-71195";"Ember has been searching for you all for a long time."
"204987124-0-71196";"Is the Emerald Eye a threat to you any longer?"
"204987124-0-71197";"Are you going to hurt Song? How can we trust you?"
"204987124-0-71198";"If it turns out that way, will we tell King Fahara'jad?"
"204987124-0-71199";"Do you have doubts about finding Song?"
"204987124-0-71200";"I'm not sure I understand."
"204987124-0-71201";"If you knew all of this, why haven't you tried to rescue Song yourself?"
"204987124-0-71202";"And you think it'll be different for me and Ember?"
"204987124-0-71203";"Did Song speak about any of her other friends?"
"204987124-0-71204";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-71205";"What do you want to do, Ember?"
"204987124-0-71208";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-71212";"What else can you tell me about this relic?"
"204987124-0-71215";"Do you know how to navigate the mine?"
"204987124-0-71216";"All right, let's go into the mine."
"204987124-0-71228";"Is that why you ran away and ended up in Skywatch?"
"204987124-0-71230";"What will happen to the Emerald Eye organization now?"
"204987124-0-71232";"Glad to hear it, Ember."
"204987124-0-71235";"What are ammonites?"
"204987124-0-71236";"Why would prisoners want the mine's protection?"
"204987124-0-71237";"How does House Mornard have ties to Amenos?"
"204987124-0-71238";"Why does the mine use prisoners?"
"204987124-0-71239";"What are you doing on your own then?"
"204987124-0-71241";"How does singing help you use magic?"
"204987124-0-71242";"So you play music to cast spells?"
"204987124-0-71244";"If Hadolids stay near the shore, what are they doing in the mine?"
"204987124-0-71246";"What is Brokerock Mine?"
"204987124-0-71248";"Are you worried that more Hadolids will come into the mine?"
"204987124-0-71249";"Sounds like you'll have the mine up and running in no time."
"204987124-0-71252";"Where do you think you'll go?"
"204987124-0-71253";"Do you think your father will let you go?"
"204987124-0-71256";"Why not just send regular invitations?"
"204987124-0-71257";"Why not just send regular invitations?"
"204987124-0-71258";"He ordered the Magus to attack All Flags Islet, but we never saw him at the castle."
"204987124-0-71260";"You want me to lie to the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-71261";"How will you get Gonfalon Palace ready for a celebration so quickly?"
"204987124-0-71263";"All right. See you there."
"204987124-0-71268";"How do you know Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-71276";"Did you catch which ship he took?"
"204987124-0-71277";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-71278";"We're going after this Kiv Lindres, then."
"204987124-0-71279";"Let's head to Seyda Neen."
"204987124-0-71280";"He took something valuable from a friend."
"204987124-0-71282";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-71284";"How is the Abbey?"
"204987124-0-71287";"High King Emeric, Queen Ayrenn, and Prince Irnskar fought together against the Ascendant Magus."
"204987124-0-71288";"You won't be telling the Abbey's story?"
"204987124-0-71289";"How is Gavos doing with all the visitors?"
"204987124-0-71290";"Where is Sareloth Grotto?"
"204987124-0-71293";"How will a shell help me find the medallions?"
"204987124-0-71296";"I'll head to Sareloth Grotto and use the shell to find the medallions."
"204987124-0-71297";"What are you and Daluion doing here?"
"204987124-0-71298";"Is it working? Is the festival making you happy?"
"204987124-0-71300";"How do you know they were real?"
"204987124-0-71302";"How did you find out Kiv was the thief?"
"204987124-0-71303";"What did he manage to steal besides your earrings?"
"204987124-0-71304";"You know Isobel and Aurelia, then?"
"204987124-0-71305";"The city guard was no help?"
"204987124-0-71306";"Thank you, Captain."
"204987124-0-71307";"What have you been up to since we last saw each other, Jakarn?"
"204987124-0-71308";"Do you have any theories?"
"204987124-0-71310";"All right, let's go find Valessea."
"204987124-0-71311";"You expected him to die?"
"204987124-0-71312";"What does that have to do with the map fragments?"
"204987124-0-71313";"You have a deal. Take it."
"204987124-0-71314";"Deal. Here you go."
"204987124-0-71317";"You have a deal. Here you go."
"204987124-0-71323";"Tarazka said he left a lantern near the opening they disappeared into. Let's look for that."
"204987124-0-71329";"You'd like us to find her?"
"204987124-0-71330";"Where do you think he'd go in Gonfalon Bay?"
"204987124-0-71332";"Understood. Any other leads on where we might find Aurelia?"
"204987124-0-71333";"Sounds good. Let's go."
"204987124-0-71334";"How is Zenithar celebrated?"
"204987124-0-71336";"I'll help you gather what you need to create the offering."
"204987124-0-71340";"He thinks you're smitten with him."
"204987124-0-71341";"No game. Um, I'm just trying to remember. You've been gone so long."
"204987124-0-71342";"Lady Laurent, is that you?"
"204987124-0-71344";"And what should I call you … my darling …."
"204987124-0-71345";"Do you remember your love now?"
"204987124-0-71347";"Ever since Tobin Moorcroft?"
"204987124-0-71351";"What happened to Caska?"
"204987124-0-71353";"That's not a good sign."
"204987124-0-71354";"What does this festival celebrate?"
"204987124-0-71355";"How did you lose your job?"
"204987124-0-71356";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-71357";"Thanks, Galedra."
"204987124-0-71358";"How do you know so much about what he does?"
"204987124-0-71359";"If he's that old, why assault the tower now?"
"204987124-0-71360";"Do you know where he's gone?"
"204987124-0-71361";"Thank you, Julles."
"204987124-0-71369";"Um, all right."
"204987124-0-71372";"All right, I'll meet you at Lady Arabelle's camp."
"204987124-0-71375";"Can you tell me what the medallions are for?"
"204987124-0-71376";"By any chance, is your ship the Pristine Halberd?"
"204987124-0-71377";"Ah, yes. A fine ship. Um, and remind me. Who is the captain of the Pristine Halberd?"
"204987124-0-71378";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-71380";"Right, right. So you built all of this?"
"204987124-0-71382";"Impressive. And you carved the plaques with a hammer and chisel?"
"204987124-0-71386";"What sort of tasks would earn Zenithar's favor?"
"204987124-0-71388";"Arousing?"
"204987124-0-71392";"You don't have the ring with you?"
"204987124-0-71393";"All right. Where is it?"
"204987124-0-71394";"How can we help?"
"204987124-0-71396";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-71397";"The Ascendant Order sabotaged the lighthouse. We think they may have wrecked Lady Arabelle's ships."
"204987124-0-71398";"What were you and Guild General Quentyn doing out here?"
"204987124-0-71399";"You think the alliance leaders might also be there?"
"204987124-0-71400";"So we need to destroy the heart of the tower to kill the mage."
"204987124-0-71401";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-71403";"Build the weapon, smash the phylactery. Let's get to it."
"204987124-0-71405";"Interesting. Thanks, Rayan."
"204987124-0-71411";"Is there anything of interest here?"
"204987124-0-71412";"But then she left?"
"204987124-0-71414";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-71415";"Focus, Nilsmon. Where was Captain Marso going?"
"204987124-0-71416";"A friend of ours may be on that ship with him, and her family is worried about her."
"204987124-0-71417";"We were supposed to trade it for the wine you stole?"
"204987124-0-71418";"You were trying to fix something that thief did?"
"204987124-0-71419";"We will. Why don't you get some sleep, Nilsmon?"
"204987124-0-71420";"Sounds fair. What's your problem?"
"204987124-0-71421";"And here's your Seathorn."
"204987124-0-71422";"We're on it."
"204987124-0-71423";"Don't suppose you've seen the Knight Commander's daughter? Aurelia?"
"204987124-0-71424";"Nope. Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-71425";"Sure, I'll unlock the cage and set you free."
"204987124-0-71428";"You want us to get the wine back?"
"204987124-0-71429";"What's his port of call there?"
"204987124-0-71430";"We will. Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-71431";"Why do you think Lady Laurent's possessed by an ancient sea captain?"
"204987124-0-71432";"What are these medallions actually for?"
"204987124-0-71433";"Who am I talking to?"
"204987124-0-71434";"The big tree?"
"204987124-0-71436";"Why does the Ascendant Order want to disrupt the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-71437";"Of course. Here are the five medallions."
"204987124-0-71438";"What else should I know about Amenos?"
"204987124-0-71440";"The prisoners have free run of the jungle?"
"204987124-0-71441";"Remind me what we're doing here again."
"204987124-0-71446";"Let's go, then."
"204987124-0-71451";"Any other words of advice before I head out?"
"204987124-0-71453";"And what about the treasure?"
"204987124-0-71454";"All right, let's go after the plans."
"204987124-0-71457";"All right."
"204987124-0-71459";"Let's head to the blacksmith shop, then."
"204987124-0-71460";"Let's see it done."
"204987124-0-71464";"Sir Rayan?"
"204987124-0-71465";"You knew this would happen."
"204987124-0-71467";"Your story will live on."
"204987124-0-71468";"You sound like you don't believe it."
"204987124-0-71472";"I'll get the scoria from that pile."
"204987124-0-71474";"Captain Marso mentioned you had people looking into the thief?"
"204987124-0-71475";"And that's why you were going to the village?"
"204987124-0-71477";"She seems pretty sure of herself."
"204987124-0-71479";"Then let's keep looking."
"204987124-0-71483";"How do the medallions work?"
"204987124-0-71485";"Right. The Fighters Guildhall is my next stop."
"204987124-0-71486";"Right behind you, Caska."
"204987124-0-71490";"Yes, this is the prison island. I came to find you and the three alliance leaders."
"204987124-0-71492";"Right behind you, Caska."
"204987124-0-71493";"What about the rest of your crew?"
"204987124-0-71497";"How has the investigation gone?"
"204987124-0-71498";"I'll speak to Isobel about it."
"204987124-0-71499";"At least Aurelia and her mother are getting along better."
"204987124-0-71501";"Agreed. Let's head to Rivenspire."
"204987124-0-71502";"I remember. Did you discover what happened?"
"204987124-0-71504";"What happened to Captain Marso?"
"204987124-0-71505";"Can you remind me where Obsidian Scar is?"
"204987124-0-71506";"Too good a job?"
"204987124-0-71507";"Why hold him at Obsidian Scar?"
"204987124-0-71508";"You should know, Aurelia is the one who figured out where you'd been taken."
"204987124-0-71509";"Right. We'll see you back in town."
"204987124-0-71510";"We'll find her, don't worry."
"204987124-0-71512";"You're both different people now."
"204987124-0-71513";"Do you still want to adventure with me?"
"204987124-0-71516";"I'll go to the courtyard and deal with the Ascendant Champion."
"204987124-0-71518";"Are you sure you want to be a knight?"
"204987124-0-71519";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-71521";"Are you going to be able to get out of here?"
"204987124-0-71523";"And who's this mage you're after?"
"204987124-0-71524";"Yes, but how is it possible the mage is that old?"
"204987124-0-71525";"How are you going to get your friend out of this promise?"
"204987124-0-71527";"I'll help you, Isobel."
"204987124-0-71528";"She's a bit … unusual for a knight."
"204987124-0-71529";"She's a bit … unusual for a knight."
"204987124-0-71530";"Why are you glad she's in fighting form?"
"204987124-0-71531";"I'm sorry for your loss."
"204987124-0-71538";"Does she hide this hilt out there for every tourney?"
"204987124-0-71540";"If they're that bad, why did your mother make this promise?"
"204987124-0-71541";"She offered you up as a prize to attract interest?"
"204987124-0-71549";"Why found the Dominion?"
"204987124-0-71550";"I hope not, your Majesty."
"204987124-0-71551";"Tell me about your wife."
"204987124-0-71553";"Once the road is cleared, we could all go in together."
"204987124-0-71554";"You didn't want to be Isobel's squire?"
"204987124-0-71556";"Can you tell me what happened before your ship was wrecked?"
"204987124-0-71558";"I don't think Aurelia wishes to be pushed into a marriage."
"204987124-0-71561";"How did you gain that crown?"
"204987124-0-71563";"You know they lost control of their storm ritual?"
"204987124-0-71564";"What's so special about these plans?"
"204987124-0-71565";"Who's Caska?"
"204987124-0-71566";"What happened in the First Era?"
"204987124-0-71567";"So you need my help again?"
"204987124-0-71569";"I'll help you again."
"204987124-0-71570";"Can't we just take the Silver Swan or one of the other ships at the Navire Docks?"
"204987124-0-71571";"And we learned the Ascendant Order has a fleet of ships heading to attack All Flags Islet, right?"
"204987124-0-71572";"Of course."
"204987124-0-71573";"Tell me about All Flags Islet."
"204987124-0-71574";"Can't we just take the Silver Swan or one of the other ships at the Navire Docks?"
"204987124-0-71578";"Right, they want us to get a musical instrument."
"204987124-0-71579";"Why did a singing, sailing knight go after a ghost?"
"204987124-0-71589";"Who are the Eldertide Druids?"
"204987124-0-71590";"You've been through here before?"
"204987124-0-71591";"Do you know why they chose coral?"
"204987124-0-71592";"How can I find the corrupted coral?"
"204987124-0-71593";"Who are the Eldertide Druids?"
"204987124-0-71594";"Do you remember where the coral is?"
"204987124-0-71595";"What exactly are we searching for?"
"204987124-0-71596";"What exactly are we searching for?"
"204987124-0-71597";"What exactly are we searching for?"
"204987124-0-71598";"And that was here?"
"204987124-0-71601";"So the Oaken Order is a druidic group?"
"204987124-0-71604";"It sounds like you know her very well."
"204987124-0-71606";"That's the purpose of the conference, right?"
"204987124-0-71607";"How did you gain your crown?"
"204987124-0-71610";"Do you think Zenithar sees your efforts?"
"204987124-0-71612";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-71613";"Do you think that's going to be a problem?"
"204987124-0-71614";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-71615";"How will you use the wood?"
"204987124-0-71616";"I can tell you are passionate about your craft."
"204987124-0-71617";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-71620";"Is that all you're here to do?"
"204987124-0-71621";"Why did you throw a sweetroll at her?"
"204987124-0-71624";"As long as the high king agrees, that could work."
"204987124-0-71625";"They didn't make it easy to recover the medallions from the grotto."
"204987124-0-71626";"Has House Mornard learned anything new about the Eldertide Druids at the Coral Cliffs?"
"204987124-0-71630";"What's so unbelievable?"
"204987124-0-71633";"So if you tried restoring the wards, it might make things worse?"
"204987124-0-71634";"Why can't you restore the wards yourself?"
"204987124-0-71635";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-71636";"You don't think Gonfalon needs the deliveries?"
"204987124-0-71637";"Are the prisoners transported to Amenos treated badly?"
"204987124-0-71638";"Why is Chyrisnia here?"
"204987124-0-71640";"So you won't give Brusic or Veslyn a hard time?"
"204987124-0-71641";"What else can you tell me about this corruption that's afflicting the grove?"
"204987124-0-71644";"So how did you convince the archdruid to let you investigate?"
"204987124-0-71645";"Tell me about these three circles."
"204987124-0-71646";"What's the True Way?"
"204987124-0-71647";"Are you saying you want to leave Tor Draioch?"
"204987124-0-71651";"So what's next for Ember the Sorcerer?"
"204987124-0-71652";"Isobel and I will get it back."
"204987124-0-71654";"All right, I'm with you. Let's deal with the Ascendant Order leaders."
"204987124-0-71655";"Now's not the time, Prince Irnskar. We need to get you and the others to High Isle."
"204987124-0-71656";"How did you know about the wards in the first place?"
"204987124-0-71661";"What's your role here?"
"204987124-0-71662";"Of course."
"204987124-0-71664";"It's a resort?"
"204987124-0-71665";"Right. Like an author. You wrote the Investigator Vale books, didn't you?"
"204987124-0-71666";"Well, take care, Jakarn."
"204987124-0-71668";"Forgiveness."
"204987124-0-71671";"A circlet."
"204987124-0-71679";"Looting and pillaging."
"204987124-0-71680";"A temple where his devotees dedicate themselves to his ways."
"204987124-0-71682";"Yes, I'd like to answer another question about Zenithar."
"204987124-0-71685";"So, about Investigator Vale …."
"204987124-0-71686";"Should we do something about them?"
"204987124-0-71688";"I'll go search through Magister Irin's things in the tower."
"204987124-0-71689";"So you aren't the author of the Investigator Vale books?"
"204987124-0-71690";"What does the Ascendant Order want?"
"204987124-0-71697";"Accept the mantle of a priest."
"204987124-0-71699";"The mallet."
"204987124-0-71700";"The land I amassed."
"204987124-0-71701";"Every other merchant who let another stall be ransacked would have to pay for the stolen goods."
"204987124-0-71706";"Are you sure your traps will work on the motes?"
"204987124-0-71711";"What does Magister Irin say about it?"
"204987124-0-71712";"How did you come up with that idea?"
"204987124-0-71713";"Do you not like Huldressa?"
"204987124-0-71714";"Are you sure your traps will work on the motes?"
"204987124-0-71715";"It's the Ascendant Order. The inn's patrons said they've been robbing people and attacking caravans."
"204987124-0-71717";"Someone called the Ascendant Magus recruited salvagers to capture shipwreck survivors."
"204987124-0-71719";"Who is this Ascendant Magus?"
"204987124-0-71720";"Tell me about the guild representatives."
"204987124-0-71723";"How do you play?"
"204987124-0-71725";"All right. So, where can I get these decks of Tribute cards?"
"204987124-0-71726";"Wait. What does your missing cargo have to do with the delegates?"
"204987124-0-71727";"Wait. What does your missing cargo have to do with the delegates?"
"204987124-0-71728";"Isobel and I will leave you to your friends, then."
"204987124-0-71729";"You know the Ascendant Order? What else can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-71730";"You know the Ascendant Order? What else can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-71731";"I just saw Brahgas outside."
"204987124-0-71733";"Roister's Club?"
"204987124-0-71734";"Can you tell me a little about yourself?"
"204987124-0-71735";"What do I do with these?"

"204987124-0-71742";"Have any advice on how to improve my game?"
"204987124-0-71743";"Anyone else?"
"204987124-0-71744";"Are there other rewards?"
"204987124-0-71746";"Yes, I'll join the Gonfalon Chapter of the Roister's Club."
"204987124-0-71748";"Why did the druids leave the mainland?"
"204987124-0-71750";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-71751";"Are you some kind of wyress?"
"204987124-0-71752";"Circles? What are they?"
"204987124-0-71753";"Are there other circles in the Systres Archipelago?"
"204987124-0-71754";"So druids are common on High Isle?"
"204987124-0-71757";"What exactly is a druid?"
"204987124-0-71759";"Yes. Offer Zenithar the coins you have."
"204987124-0-71766";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-71769";"All right, I'll gather some kindlepitch and then find you and the others."
"204987124-0-71771";"Sounds interesting. How do I get started?"
"204987124-0-71772";"All right, I'll speak to Razhamad."
"204987124-0-71774";"What have you been up to since we last met?"
"204987124-0-71775";"Any idea why they wanted to capture you instead of just kill you?"
"204987124-0-71776";"What were you and Guild General Quentyn doing out here?"
"204987124-0-71777";"Do you think the Ascendant Order followed you out here?"
"204987124-0-71778";"Do you think the Ascendant Order followed you out here?"
"204987124-0-71779";"Any idea where we should look for Valessea?"
"204987124-0-71782";"I'll help you find your missing friend and talk to your contact."
"204987124-0-71785";"So the corruption is gone?"
"204987124-0-71786";"Circles? What are they?"
"204987124-0-71787";"Tell me more about High King Emeric, Queen Ayrenn, and Prince Irnskar."
"204987124-0-71788";"Go on."
"204987124-0-71789";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-71793";"Ember and I are working to sort everything out here."
"204987124-0-71796";"You certainly lead an interesting life."
"204987124-0-71797";"What's this about a debt to Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-71798";"That's where we'll start."
"204987124-0-71804";"I'm not sure she's really that interested in you."
"204987124-0-71805";"What's this about a debt to Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-71809";"How do these tournaments work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-71810";"Do winners earn a prize?"
"204987124-0-71812";"Will you be competing in these tournaments?"
"204987124-0-71813";"You were able to enter his arcane library just by picking the lock?"
"204987124-0-71814";"I'll see you in the Shield Hall, then."
"204987124-0-71816";"How did you get so good at lockpicking?"
"204987124-0-71821";"We'll find the seathorn and trade it for your wine."
"204987124-0-71823";"Good luck with your back, Halz."
"204987124-0-71824";"So, where do I fit in?"
"204987124-0-71832";"I'm a mage. Can I help with the counterspell part?"
"204987124-0-71833";"How should I gain experience?"
"204987124-0-71834";"All right. I'll challenge one of the players here to a game of Tribute."
"204987124-0-71835";"Do you think that Windsorrow spirit is actually here?"
"204987124-0-71836";"So what do you think we might find at the ritual site?"
"204987124-0-71839";"How do I acquire these new cards and decks?"
"204987124-0-71840";"Can I find decks anywhere else?"
"204987124-0-71841";"So, do I know everything now?"
"204987124-0-71847";"Who?"
"204987124-0-71850";"I think so."
"204987124-0-71857";"And then Oblan will set it all off with an arrow?"
"204987124-0-71858";"You said the master shipbuilder's office is just over the bridge?"
"204987124-0-71860";"Will I have to play against anyone from the Gonfalon Chapter?"
"204987124-0-71862";"Any preferences on who we play?"
"204987124-0-71863";"How are you feeling?"
"204987124-0-71864";"I will. Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-71868";"Do you think you found treasure because the priest blessed you?"
"204987124-0-71869";"Remind me."
"204987124-0-71871";"What did they do?"
"204987124-0-71873";"Then I would face you."
"204987124-0-71874";"What can we do about the volcano?"
"204987124-0-71878";"Tell me more about Y'ffelon and Mount Firesong."
"204987124-0-71879";"What are we looking for?"
"204987124-0-71880";"Enough talk. Let's play. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-71882";"What does advancing to intermediate play mean?"
"204987124-0-71883";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-71889";"Would a city offer you more opportunities?"
"204987124-0-71890";"What will you tell the Knight Commander?"
"204987124-0-71897";"Parisse Plouff said it threatened pilgrims?"
"204987124-0-71903";"Captain Kaleen saw the dockmaster accept gold from the Magus when they captured her."
"204987124-0-71905";"I'll help you interrogate Dockmaster Arnauld."
"204987124-0-71906";"The All Flags Navy?"
"204987124-0-71912";"If you're being ignored here, why don't you go somewhere else?"
"204987124-0-71913";"Closed the path?"
"204987124-0-71915";"Do you know where he's being held?"
"204987124-0-71916";"Why did this Marcott woman kidnap Captain Marso?"
"204987124-0-71917";"Can you remind me where Obsidian Scar is?"
"204987124-0-71918";"I helped a woman named Lashgikh swear vengeance on the murderers that killed her husband."
"204987124-0-71919";"Why did this Marcott woman kidnap Captain Marso?"
"204987124-0-71922";"I met your parents."
"204987124-0-71923";"What sort of information?"
"204987124-0-71924";"All that just by sprinkling some reagents in lava?"
"204987124-0-71925";"And what will you do with this research?"
"204987124-0-71927";"What about the Ascendant Lord? Isn't he still a threat?"
"204987124-0-71929";"I'll go speak with Lord Bacaro."
"204987124-0-71931";"If we don't succeed, do you really think you'll have to get married?"
"204987124-0-71932";"If we don't succeed, do you really think you'll have to get married?"
"204987124-0-71933";"What advantage would marrying you give them?"
"204987124-0-71936";"Why did your mother make this promise?"
"204987124-0-71940";"How do you have it in hand, exactly?"
"204987124-0-71942";"What do you mean, both halves?"
"204987124-0-71947";"What do you want?"
"204987124-0-71948";"I'll buy your mark of protection."
"204987124-0-71949";"Here, renew my mark of protection."
"204987124-0-71957";"Y'ffre?"
"204987124-0-71958";"And what did the elders say?"
"204987124-0-71959";"And the other two druidic circles?"
"204987124-0-71960";"What else can you tell me about this corruption that's afflicting the grove?"
"204987124-0-71961";"So you're a priest of Y'ffre?"
"204987124-0-71962";"What else can you tell me about this corruption that's afflicting the grove?"
"204987124-0-71963";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-71964";"Tell me about the designs we found."
"204987124-0-71965";"Tell me about the designs we found."
"204987124-0-71966";"Are the lodestones mentioned in any of your plans?"
"204987124-0-71968";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-71969";"Are you in charge of House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-71977";"Why do you care about dead knights from a different order?"
"204987124-0-71978";"The brink of ruin?"
"204987124-0-71979";"The Mages Guild must believe you can do the job."
"204987124-0-71980";"Are you enjoying the party?"
"204987124-0-71981";"If you're up to it, we can search for the queen and the others together."
"204987124-0-71983";"What is Brokerock Mine?"
"204987124-0-71985";"Why do you need an escort?"
"204987124-0-71987";"I was glad to help."
"204987124-0-71989";"So what do you want to do next?"
"204987124-0-71991";"Can you tell me what you need me to find and what I may encounter in the ruins of the keep?"
"204987124-0-71993";"Where are the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-71995";"Where's Queen Ayrenn now?"
"204987124-0-72000";"I'll go inside and see what's in there."
"204987124-0-72002";"All right, captain."
"204987124-0-72004";"Right. The captains said a storm wrecked their ships. We know the Ascendant Magus uses storm magic."
"204987124-0-72005";"Did you see what happened to the Colossus of Gonfalon?"
"204987124-0-72008";"I'll find the items you need for your weather ritual."
"204987124-0-72009";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-72010";"I was sad not to see you on Summerset."
"204987124-0-72011";"I suppose. About the proxy queen …."
"204987124-0-72012";"I'm surprised he's not here with you."
"204987124-0-72013";"Why found the Dominion?"

"204987124-0-72053";"Do you plan to go forward with the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-72054";"The Emperor making weapons of children is a lot to stomach."
"204987124-0-72055";"You mentioned the Skald-King. Why isn't he at these talks?"
"204987124-0-72056";"How are you getting along with Bazrag?"
"204987124-0-72057";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-72060";"How have you been, your majesty?"
"204987124-0-72062";"She's going to make an excellent queen."
"204987124-0-72063";"How is Razum-dar these days?"
"204987124-0-72064";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-72065";"Some friends of mine were unfairly targeted, your majesty. I helped them out."
"204987124-0-72066";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-72067";"Where should we start?"
"204987124-0-72069";"I'll return after we've searched all three locations."
"204987124-0-72070";"Be careful, Queen Ayrenn. The Green Serpents are still hunting for you."
"204987124-0-72071";"Do you plan to go forward with the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-72072";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-72073";"Why did the Pact send Prince Irnskar instead of his father?"
"204987124-0-72074";"What kind of offer?"

"204987124-0-72076";"Can you tell me more about this malady?"
"204987124-0-72077";"What do you do here?"
"204987124-0-72078";"Are you sure you want to investigate the cave in person?"
"204987124-0-72081";"The other patients don't trust you?"
"204987124-0-72082";"How'd you come to be a patient here?"
"204987124-0-72086";"And the other druids accepted you?"
"204987124-0-72087";"And the third?"
"204987124-0-72088";"You're part of the Stonelore Circle Druids?"
"204987124-0-72090";"What can you tell me about the druid circles?"
"204987124-0-72091";"Those who work for you are prisoners?"
"204987124-0-72092";"Where did the Hadolids come from?"
"204987124-0-72095";"Do you think this treasure was worth the trouble?"
"204987124-0-72096";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-72097";"Do you know where Mender Roslenn went?"

"204987124-0-72124";"What brought you to Steadfast Manor?"
"204987124-0-72126";"How did she calm you?"
"204987124-0-72131";"What's the secret?"
"204987124-0-72132";"Will you be able to keep Hilgrim from drinking your new batch?"
"204987124-0-72133";"What's your history with Hilgrim?"
"204987124-0-72135";"Why should I release you?"
"204987124-0-72136";"How can I free you?"
"204987124-0-72139";"What happened to these pirates?"
"204987124-0-72141";"The alliance leaders aren't safe here at Mandrake Manor?"
"204987124-0-72142";"Kishka?"
"204987124-0-72143";"Have any advice on how to improve my game?"
"204987124-0-72144";"What can you tell me about Razhamad?"
"204987124-0-72145";"I'll tell your father what we found."
"204987124-0-72146";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-72147";"Meryline's magic can keep the Hadolids from attacking her."
"204987124-0-72149";"I'll make sure Meryline's safe."
"204987124-0-72152";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-72153";"Where's your sentry?"
"204987124-0-72154";"What are you doing in Gonfalon?"
"204987124-0-72155";"Are you going to leave the archipelago?"
"204987124-0-72157";"Your father let you leave to go on adventures?"
"204987124-0-72163";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-72164";"You can do that?"
"204987124-0-72165";"Let's find some Hadolids."
"204987124-0-72166";"Wayllod said you want the crates of supplies found and destroyed."
"204987124-0-72167";"Mender Teliel told me a few patients have vanished as well."
"204987124-0-72168";"What does Razhamad think about it?"
"204987124-0-72170";"Sounds like you speak from personal experience."
"204987124-0-72171";"Mender Roslenn had a theory about cursed humors. And she began researching a cure."
"204987124-0-72172";"How do we get Master Healer Viralaine's key?"
"204987124-0-72173";"What do you mean they're close?"
"204987124-0-72174";"You said he's Mender Roslenn's aide?"
"204987124-0-72175";"How do we get Master Healer Viralaine's key?"
"204987124-0-72176";"Doesn't House Dufort have knights that can deal with this sort of thing?"
"204987124-0-72178";"Can I win multiple prizes for the same challenge?"
"204987124-0-72180";"Thanks. I'll go speak to Kishka."
"204987124-0-72182";"You mentioned Amenos. What about it?"
"204987124-0-72184";"And what about the serpent eggs?"
"204987124-0-72186";"I'll head there now and help the captain."
"204987124-0-72189";"What's in it?"
"204987124-0-72193";"You mentioned you're part of the Stonelore Circle Druids?"
"204987124-0-72200";"Very well. I'll open the cage and get the antidote."
"204987124-0-72202";"Unconventional? You imprisoned Seraphyne and drugged Roslenn."
"204987124-0-72204";"But your cure would have made vampires of them all."
"204987124-0-72205";"How will the tournament play out?"
"204987124-0-72209";"Your days in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-72211";"If you say so."
"204987124-0-72212";"Nothing, we're just hoping he's seen Aurelia Jourvel recently."
"204987124-0-72214";"You joined a knightly order?"
"204987124-0-72215";"All right. Thanks."
"204987124-0-72217";"If you'd joined one of the orders, you wouldn't be traveling?"
"204987124-0-72218";"Thanks for chatting, Isobel."
"204987124-0-72219";"Do you regret traveling with me instead of joining an order?"
"204987124-0-72222";"You and your wife have a strange relationship."
"204987124-0-72224";"You're saying you think she came from money?"
"204987124-0-72225";"Tell me about Silverslip."
"204987124-0-72226";"What do you think happened?"
"204987124-0-72227";"Have you been back to Skywatch since?"
"204987124-0-72228";"Can you tell me more about your friends?"
"204987124-0-72229";"What kind of trouble?"
"204987124-0-72230";"Do you think there's a connection between this letter and her past in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-72232";"What does Draigh mean?"
"204987124-0-72234";"None of this was your fault, Ember."
"204987124-0-72235";"Then let's make it right by saving Jhaka now."
"204987124-0-72236";"None of this was your fault, Ember."
"204987124-0-72237";"Thanks, Jhaka."
"204987124-0-72238";"Which order do you want to join?"
"204987124-0-72239";"How does the tourney work?"
"204987124-0-72240";"Got it. Why are you so eager to help Aurelia?"
"204987124-0-72241";"So why send me to investigate Whalefall?"
"204987124-0-72242";"What does Draigh mean?"
"204987124-0-72243";"What does Draigh mean?"
"204987124-0-72244";"What should I be looking for?"
"204987124-0-72246";"How did you get away?"
"204987124-0-72247";"Maybe. Razhamad asked me to check on her."
"204987124-0-72248";"I don't know what's troubling her yet. That's why I need to find her."
"204987124-0-72250";"And what happened to the Redguard?"
"204987124-0-72251";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-72254";"We'll figure it out, Ember."
"204987124-0-72255";"What brings you to Gonfalon Bay?"
"204987124-0-72257";"A tiny sweet?"
"204987124-0-72258";"You're going to continue to help her investigate, then?"
"204987124-0-72259";"What did the letter say?"
"204987124-0-72260";"Learning more about that glyph might lead us to Song."
"204987124-0-72261";"You didn't know what would happen."
"204987124-0-72263";"Take care."
"204987124-0-72264";"Why didn't you tell any of your friends about the letter?"
"204987124-0-72266";"And now she's here?"
"204987124-0-72267";"So … you're a vampire now."
"204987124-0-72268";"And if she is a willing participant?"
"204987124-0-72269";"Why threaten Jhaka and Silverslip with the letter?"
"204987124-0-72270";"I'll return the blessed awl to you."
"204987124-0-72271";"And what do you know about Hadolids themselves?"
"204987124-0-72272";"We need to find her. Where is she?"
"204987124-0-72273";"So, you tried to sabotage our team by getting Sorinne hooked again?"
"204987124-0-72274";"Yes we do. And we intend to win."
"204987124-0-72280";"I'm sure there is."
"204987124-0-72281";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-72282";"Fair enough. How do we get to the ruin?"
"204987124-0-72283";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-72284";"Will you be safe? King Fahara'jad has agents looking for you and the Emerald Eye."
"204987124-0-72285";"What did that relic actually do?"
"204987124-0-72286";"You should know King Faharajad promised to protect you, should you need it."
"204987124-0-72287";"I'm surprised the Nord Cultural Exchange is still in business."
"204987124-0-72288";"I'm surprised the Nord Cultural Exchange is still in business."
"204987124-0-72289";"Let's play.  (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72291";"What did that relic actually do?"
"204987124-0-72292";"Glad to hear it. Good luck."
"204987124-0-72294";"What can you tell me about Ghost Haven Bay?"
"204987124-0-72299";"So you haven't found the next world-ending threat to deal with?"
"204987124-0-72300";"The Anchorite and Calia survived living in the Deadlands, I'm sure they can handle Tamriel."
"204987124-0-72301";"Dreams? Like the ones you had before?"
"204987124-0-72304";"She doesn't look good. How much rotmeth did you buy for her?"
"204987124-0-72308";"Good. So, what's next?"
"204987124-0-72310";"Can you tell us where your treasure is?"
"204987124-0-72311";"So this place was connected to the magic beneath the sea?"
"204987124-0-72312";"What are the deep druids you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-72316";"What do you mean, druids have been afflicted?"
"204987124-0-72317";"And some of these ships were wrecked nearby?"
"204987124-0-72318";"Why do you think I'll find these crates in Shipwreck Shoals?"
"204987124-0-72320";"<<1>> got into her carriage and drove home?"
"204987124-0-72323";"What do you mean, a druidic circle?"
"204987124-0-72325";"What exactly did the man in the back room give you for dessert?"
"204987124-0-72326";"And the man in the back room just gave you a dessert? What did he give you?"
"204987124-0-72329";"The man in the back room at the inn. Was that <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-72331";"I swear."
"204987124-0-72332";"You're going to travel?"
"204987124-0-72333";"What does that have to do with your promise?"
"204987124-0-72335";"You promised her hand so that you would hold true to your bargain?"
"204987124-0-72336";"Thank you for speaking to me, Knight Commander."
"204987124-0-72347";"The spirit of the grove? You mean the Evergrowth?"
"204987124-0-72348";"Do you still plan to participate in the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-72349";"Is Fennorian here?"
"204987124-0-72351";"You think Zenithar's worshippers would hunt you?"
"204987124-0-72353";"Do you think the peace talks will still take place?"
"204987124-0-72355";"Do you think the peace talks will continue?"
"204987124-0-72357";"But you've done work for the Tribunal plenty of times."
"204987124-0-72358";"I'm surprised the Tribunal doesn't have more work for you."
"204987124-0-72359";"What about the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-72362";"Didn't you think we were going to defeat the Ascendant Order at All Flags Islet?"
"204987124-0-72363";"What happened to the Ascendant Order ships?"
"204987124-0-72364";"How did reminding her of a good fight turn into throwing a sweetroll at her?"
"204987124-0-72365";"That's probably a good idea."
"204987124-0-72366";"Did Naryu see you?"
"204987124-0-72371";"I'll tell the druids."
"204987124-0-72372";"Do you think the Green Serpents are connected to the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-72376";"Good luck, Jakarn."
"204987124-0-72377";"I'll head into the jungle and start looking."
"204987124-0-72379";"So you don't want to take any changes with the wrong arcane glyph?"
"204987124-0-72383";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-72384";"Where can I find <<1>> and <<2>>?"
"204987124-0-72385";"And <<1>> wanted a dessert?"
"204987124-0-72387";"How so?"
"204987124-0-72389";"And Ember isn't."
"204987124-0-72390";"Why do you need components from this specific site?"
"204987124-0-72392";"You can't just get the druids to give you some of their components or answer your questions?"
"204987124-0-72393";"Lady Laurent?"
"204987124-0-72394";"I'm assisting my friend in her trial for the order."
"204987124-0-72396";"Well, thank you for the lute."
"204987124-0-72405";"You don't seem much like a knight in training."
"204987124-0-72408";"Locals saw the vulk'esh?"
"204987124-0-72409";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-72411";"What about the restoration ritual we found?"
"204987124-0-72413";"Aren't you coming?"
"204987124-0-72414";"All right. I'll go look for High King Emeric in the cave over there."
"204987124-0-72416";"So, what now?"
"204987124-0-72417";"What's your theory about the cause?"
"204987124-0-72419";"Other than you, you mean?"
"204987124-0-72422";"Yes. Only one of us can win."
"204987124-0-72423";"What are scoria?"
"204987124-0-72424";"See you there, Sorinne."
"204987124-0-72425";"You'll do great. Speaking of Brahgas, where is he?"
"204987124-0-72427";"How was that?"
"204987124-0-72428";"Yes, yes. But tell me your name, captain."
"204987124-0-72429";"So you're Captain Renwic Moorcroft?"
"204987124-0-72430";"Captain?"
"204987124-0-72432";"Have you asked for help?"
"204987124-0-72433";"You need to be careful."
"204987124-0-72437";"Lady Arabelle suspects a link between the storms and the volcanic activity."
"204987124-0-72439";"I think so. She said she had a task for you. It seemed rather urgent."
"204987124-0-72441";"Bound it? The spirit of the grove is a prisoner?"
"204987124-0-72442";"Why don't you believe Druid Audrine?"
"204987124-0-72443";"If no one is allowed down here, where did all these corrupted druids and creatures come from?"
"204987124-0-72444";"You two are not of the same circle?"
"204987124-0-72445";"Are all druids this upset?"
"204987124-0-72446";"I have nothing to give you."
"204987124-0-72448";"Are there just Eldertide and Stonelore Druids?"
"204987124-0-72450";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-72451";"But what happens after I get inside?"
"204987124-0-72452";"Tell me more about Amenos Station."
"204987124-0-72453";"How did the two of you meet?"
"204987124-0-72454";"How long does the processing usually take?"
"204987124-0-72455";"What were you and Valentyn doing when the jailers arrested him?"
"204987124-0-72456";"What were you and Valentyn doing when the jailers arrested him?"
"204987124-0-72457";"So what does a mediator do exactly?"
"204987124-0-72458";"What does a mediator do exactly?"
"204987124-0-72459";"Do I look like an errand runner? Tell me where Valentyn is or prepare for a whole lot of pain."
"204987124-0-72461";"So how do I get to the caldera and where can I find Valentyn?"
"204987124-0-72462";"What about High King Emeric? Have you seen him?"
"204987124-0-72463";"I do. Lady Arabelle gave me hers."
"204987124-0-72466";"How long have you held the title?"
"204987124-0-72468";"You're talking about Brahgas, aren't you?"
"204987124-0-72469";"Is that a threat?"
"204987124-0-72470";"That seems like an important role."
"204987124-0-72471";"What events will be happening at the tourney?"
"204987124-0-72472";"They keep you busy, it seems."
"204987124-0-72473";"Overseeing the tourney seems like an important role."
"204987124-0-72474";"Why do you have to come into the keep with me?"
"204987124-0-72479";"Is she really that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-72480";"Any other threats I should be aware of?"
"204987124-0-72481";"So they're being more aggressive?"
"204987124-0-72482";"She's getting away."
"204987124-0-72485";"Why do you call them faceless?"
"204987124-0-72487";"Speaking of Brahgas, have you heard from him?"
"204987124-0-72489";"All right. Let me know if something's gone wrong."
"204987124-0-72490";"You're talking about Brahgas, right?"
"204987124-0-72492";"Enough talk. Let's play. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72493";"Me?"
"204987124-0-72495";"But if I beat Brahgas, he won't win the gold he needs to pay off his debts."
"204987124-0-72496";"And what if you don't? Then what?"
"204987124-0-72498";"Yes. Let's play. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72499";"Fall apart? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-72500";"And you think the other two keys are at the spots you marked on my map?"
"204987124-0-72501";"So, you need to break into this vault to get the gem so you can break into another vault?"
"204987124-0-72502";"Razhamad put the entire chapter on the line to save Brahgas?"
"204987124-0-72503";"So, I have to beat Teliv to save Brahgas and the chapter?"
"204987124-0-72505";"Where exactly is this vault?"
"204987124-0-72506";"So what happened when Famaza finally confronted her sisters?"
"204987124-0-72507";"What happened to these pirates?"
"204987124-0-72508";"What happened to these pirates?"
"204987124-0-72509";"What about the jungle? I've heard it's pretty dangerous beyond those gates."
"204987124-0-72510";"It seems fine now."
"204987124-0-72512";"Tell me about the monsters."
"204987124-0-72513";"Are you talking about the Firepot?"
"204987124-0-72514";"The voice probably belonged to Sir Nathain Galien."
"204987124-0-72515";"The soldiers' illness wasn't contagious."
"204987124-0-72516";"I went inside the cave and collected the vulk'esh's scoria."
"204987124-0-72517";"If all of the delegates have a medallion, can you use them to find the missing ships?"
"204987124-0-72518";"Should we head directly to the abandoned crypts you saw?"
"204987124-0-72519";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-72520";"What alliances?"
"204987124-0-72521";"What if this is a trap?"
"204987124-0-72522";"What are they fighting about?"
"204987124-0-72527";"What do you mean Privette found her way to you?"
"204987124-0-72528";"Can you tell me about the Hadolids?"
"204987124-0-72529";"Do you know where these Hadolids came from?"
"204987124-0-72530";"I do."
"204987124-0-72532";"Why did you think the Hadolids would be friendly?"
"204987124-0-72533";"Why do you think they kept Privette alive?"
"204987124-0-72534";"So what's next for you, Valentyn?"
"204987124-0-72535";"Something romantic?"
"204987124-0-72536";"All right, I'll put you in my pack."

"204987124-0-72541";"Let's play. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72542";"Why do you want me to put you in my pack?"
"204987124-0-72548";"Can you fix it?"
"204987124-0-72549";"How do I feel about … torchbugs? Why?"
"204987124-0-72550";"Who sponsors these jobs of yours?"
"204987124-0-72551";"Who sponsors these jobs of yours?"
"204987124-0-72552";"Who sponsors these jobs of yours?"
"204987124-0-72553";"Do you do this often?"
"204987124-0-72554";"You and Genalda are partners?"
"204987124-0-72555";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-72557";"How about the gambling? Will that stop too?"
"204987124-0-72560";"So now you're trying to find it."
"204987124-0-72561";"Need me to find the other map fragments?"
"204987124-0-72562";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-72564";"Thank you for sponsoring me."
"204987124-0-72565";"And why do you think this is related to a curse?"
"204987124-0-72566";"Big meeting? You mean the upcoming peace talks?"
"204987124-0-72567";"What can you tell me about this sea captain?"
"204987124-0-72568";"What can you tell me about this sea captain?"
"204987124-0-72569";"Sounds like you've been busy."
"204987124-0-72570";"What's this about a debt to Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-72571";"I helped him keep the knights of Death's Valor trapped."
"204987124-0-72573";"It's good to see you again, Stibbons."
"204987124-0-72574";"And the Trials provide a password?"
"204987124-0-72575";"What are your plans now that the tournaments are over?"
"204987124-0-72576";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-72578";"I've helped the Stonelore Circle once before."
"204987124-0-72579";"So why do you need me?"
"204987124-0-72580";"How did you end up separated from Silverslip and Song?"
"204987124-0-72582";"I'm sorry that happened to you, Jhaka."
"204987124-0-72583";"Why do you want this shield?"
"204987124-0-72584";"Then what are the mercenaries for?"
"204987124-0-72585";"Why do you think Lady Laurent's possessed by an ancient sea captain?"
"204987124-0-72586";"So what exactly are you and Lady Laurent doing here?"
"204987124-0-72587";"So what exactly are you and Lady Laurent doing here?"
"204987124-0-72588";"Why do you think Lady Laurent's possessed by an ancient sea captain?"
"204987124-0-72589";"How will you commune with the nature spirits?"
"204987124-0-72590";"What sort of villainy are you hoping to find?"
"204987124-0-72591";"Why would power from Arkay improve your abilities?"
"204987124-0-72592";"You want to use it again?"
"204987124-0-72594";"Your squire seems upset."
"204987124-0-72595";"What sort of villainy are you hoping to find?"
"204987124-0-72596";"Well, I heard there was an evil knight blocking the roads into a town to the south."
"204987124-0-72605";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-72608";"How does Jhaka know how to track down mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-72609";"Why here?"
"204987124-0-72611";"Ember and I will investigate."
"204987124-0-72612";"How much do we need?"
"204987124-0-72615";"We're looking for a ship. Nereid's Song. It's in a hidden cove somewhere along the western coast."
"204987124-0-72618";"Good guess. Lady Arabelle also needs someone to crew the ship after we steal it."
"204987124-0-72621";"How do you know they don't have the alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-72622";"She might be able to help us find Song."
"204987124-0-72624";"What now?"
"204987124-0-72625";"What will you do when you get back?"
"204987124-0-72627";"Is that why you linger here? Because you were murdered?"
"204987124-0-72628";"I'd challenge you to a Tribute match."
"204987124-0-72630";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72632";"I suppose. But how can you play Tribute if you're blind?"
"204987124-0-72633";"You made the cards? You're a Roister's Club Founder?"
"204987124-0-72635";"Yes, let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72636";"Care for a match?"
"204987124-0-72638";"You're a Roister's Club Founder?"
"204987124-0-72642";"All right, let's play Tales of Tribute!"
"204987124-0-72643";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72644";"You're one of the creators of Tales of Tribute?"
"204987124-0-72647";"Let's play. I'll show you a winning strategy."
"204987124-0-72648";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72649";"Why do you think the Ascendant Order tried to stop you from reaching the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-72652";"Do you think we'll have more trouble with the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-72655";"Well, we kind of knew all that already."
"204987124-0-72657";"You're sure the Ascendant Order wants you all dead?"
"204987124-0-72658";"Stories you wrote?"
"204987124-0-72661";"And do you play?"
"204987124-0-72662";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-72663";"Let's test that. Play me."
"204987124-0-72664";"What are you saying?"
"204987124-0-72666";"If it's a festival of labor, what do you do?"
"204987124-0-72667";"Did you say that praying to Zenithar isn't necessary?"
"204987124-0-72668";"Do you have the lay of Dreadsail Reef?"
"204987124-0-72671";"What can you tell me about the Fleet Queen?"
"204987124-0-72673";"What can you tell me about the Fleet Queen?"
"204987124-0-72676";"Why do you think Aurelia went to Stros M'Kai?"
"204987124-0-72678";"Thanks for chatting with me, Isobel."
"204987124-0-72679";"Do you see your family very often?"
"204987124-0-72682";"I hope so."
"204987124-0-72683";"What can you tell me about the All Flags Navy?"
"204987124-0-72686";"I'll be sure to speak with Brahgas and Sorinne. Anything else?"
"204987124-0-72687";"All right. I'll speak with Brahgas and Sorinne and make a name for myself."
"204987124-0-72690";"Will you let her go adventuring?"
"204987124-0-72691";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-72694";"You don't feel that way about her now?"
"204987124-0-72696";"Does Tales of Tribute involve a lot of betting?"
"204987124-0-72697";"You're right, Zenithar wants you to have that treasure."
"204987124-0-72698";"You mentioned a gaming hall?"
"204987124-0-72699";"So, now people just play games in there?"
"204987124-0-72700";"What was going on with that woman just a moment ago?"
"204987124-0-72701";"Chapter seat?"
"204987124-0-72702";"What brings you to High Isle?"
"204987124-0-72704";"I can't give you anything, but I hope you have some luck in Belkarth."
"204987124-0-72705";"Here's some gold for your troubles."
"204987124-0-72706";"What was going on with that woman a moment ago?"
"204987124-0-72707";"Can anyone join?"
"204987124-0-72708";"Brahgas seems like quite the gambler."
"204987124-0-72709";"What was his scheme?"
"204987124-0-72710";"He's using a stolen signet ring belonging to the Veloise family."
"204987124-0-72712";"Thank you. My friend and I will take it from here."
"204987124-0-72714";"Amunara was just here. She's looking for you."
"204987124-0-72716";"Should?"
"204987124-0-72719";"That sounds amazing."
"204987124-0-72720";"Why would he stay there?"
"204987124-0-72723";"That seems like a fitting punishment."
"204987124-0-72724";"He's really that charming?"
"204987124-0-72726";"I'll speak to Julles and Galedra and decide what to do."
"204987124-0-72729";"What do you want to do with it now?"
"204987124-0-72731";"All right. Where should we go?"
"204987124-0-72732";"Could your mages do the same?"
"204987124-0-72733";"What will become of the Dreadsails?"
"204987124-0-72735";"Pyandonea?"
"204987124-0-72736";"You think Taleria was guiding their ships?"
"204987124-0-72737";"Why send me to speak to a soldier?"
"204987124-0-72738";"What's wrong with Sorinne?"
"204987124-0-72739";"I'll go speak to Sorinne now."
"204987124-0-72742";"He's proud of you."
"204987124-0-72745";"We will. Thanks for your help."
"204987124-0-72746";"Did he mention the name?"
"204987124-0-72750";"What happened to the Ascendant Order ships?"
"204987124-0-72751";"How did Amunara's hirelings wreck the trial?"
"204987124-0-72752";"Maybe you should stop."
"204987124-0-72753";"What sort of celebration?"
"204987124-0-72756";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-72758";"I'll be ready."
"204987124-0-72759";"Can you tell me about Lady Joslin Garick?"
"204987124-0-72760";"Where is here, exactly?"
"204987124-0-72761";"Why can't you restore the wards yourself?"
"204987124-0-72762";"How will a story help me know the order to light the braziers in?"
"204987124-0-72763";"Do you want to head home as well, then?"
"204987124-0-72764";"What will you do then?"
"204987124-0-72765";"You plan to keep Nereid's Song?"
"204987124-0-72766";"Don't you have work to do on the Perfect Pounce II?"
"204987124-0-72768";"So what's next for you and Stibbons?"
"204987124-0-72769";"I meant no offense, Stibbons, but what happened after the curse was lifted on All Flags Islet?"
"204987124-0-72770";"Let's go, then."
"204987124-0-72771";"You're helping people?"
"204987124-0-72772";"Do you miss Isobel being at the Castle?"
"204987124-0-72773";"Who else did you commit diplomacy against?"
"204987124-0-72774";"Was Oblan not invited to come here?"
"204987124-0-72775";"Will you stay at Steadfast Manor?"
"204987124-0-72776";"And what about the volcano? Have the druids determined how to render it dormant yet?"
"204987124-0-72778";"And you're officially a knight, now?"
"204987124-0-72779";"You want me to attack her?"
"204987124-0-72780";"What do you plan to do with the shield?"
"204987124-0-72781";"What should I do until I see her again?"
"204987124-0-72782";"What did Amunara do to you?"
"204987124-0-72787";"I found a note addressed to you under one of the rugs."
"204987124-0-72788";"What can I expect from the third trial?"
"204987124-0-72790";"I saw Amunara and one of her minions performing some sort of magical attack."
"204987124-0-72794";"What's all settled?"
"204987124-0-72796";"So you'll be sailing with Captain Marso?"
"204987124-0-72798";"The Ascendant Magus was Count Damard Dufort."
"204987124-0-72802";"Go on."
"204987124-0-72805";"Can I win multiple prizes for the same challenge?"
"204987124-0-72806";"Why do you keep insulting Razhamad?"
"204987124-0-72811";"And you think you can get off Amenos on a raft?"
"204987124-0-72812";"Do you have any sailing experience?"
"204987124-0-72813";"You disagree."
"204987124-0-72816";"Where can I find these runes?"
"204987124-0-72817";"It sounds like you'll have a hard time deciding on a plan."
"204987124-0-72818";"How many runes are there?"
"204987124-0-72819";"Is this that weapon?"
"204987124-0-72820";"Where can I find these runes?"
"204987124-0-72821";"What is this device?"
"204987124-0-72822";"Why don't you try it?"
"204987124-0-72824";"You don't have those symptoms yet?"
"204987124-0-72825";"And how do I advance in rank again?"
"204987124-0-72826";"Will that allow me to challenge Tribute players in the higher ranks?"
"204987124-0-72838";"Why not avoid the area?"
"204987124-0-72841";"Guess it's time to learn some new strategies."
"204987124-0-72843";"Where do you think they're keeping the key?"
"204987124-0-72845";"You too."
"204987124-0-72851";"Who are <<1>> and <<2>>, exactly?"
"204987124-0-72852";"The Glorious Expedition? You're really a diplomat?"
"204987124-0-72854";"And what happens if he doesn't pay?"
"204987124-0-72858";"What did Jhaka tell us about the day he disappeared?"
"204987124-0-72859";"How does Jhaka know how to track down mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-72861";"I could be persuaded."
"204987124-0-72862";"And if you don't?"
"204987124-0-72864";"Someone as famous and in demand as you are must have a lot of options."
"204987124-0-72867";"Sorry, sorry. So what's next for Lady Laurent's faithful manservant?"
"204987124-0-72873";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-72874";"You found the evil knight?"
"204987124-0-72875";"Did you manage to find an evil knight?"
"204987124-0-72877";"What happens if we lose? Tell me the truth."
"204987124-0-72878";"And Brahgas?"
"204987124-0-72880";"I will do what I can."
"204987124-0-72881";"The Founders?"
"204987124-0-72882";"Why would someone seek them out?"
"204987124-0-72883";"You mentioned Founders?"
"204987124-0-72884";"And what of the current members?"
"204987124-0-72885";"Is there anyone else who might know more?"
"204987124-0-72886";"Do you have any idea where I can find one of these Founders?"
"204987124-0-72887";"You mentioned the Founders?"
"204987124-0-72888";"You don't think he will change?"
"204987124-0-72889";"How do you think Brahgas is managing since Razhamad revoked his membership?"
"204987124-0-72890";"I'm sorry."
"204987124-0-72891";"Tell me more."
"204987124-0-72892";"So, you think Brahgas is on the right path?"
"204987124-0-72893";"Now that the tournament is over, what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-72894";"Seems like you've learned a lot."
"204987124-0-72896";"Now that the tournament is over, what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-72897";"Where can I find this ghost?"
"204987124-0-72899";"Tell me about the Loch Abhain Shallows."
"204987124-0-72900";"Do you think this could turn into a steady job?"
"204987124-0-72901";"Any chance he'll come back?"
"204987124-0-72902";"And you think she was a Tribute player?"
"204987124-0-72903";"Is Gelekh making any changes since the Gonfalon Chapter's victory?"
"204987124-0-72904";"Has Teliv bothered you since you've returned?"
"204987124-0-72905";"Really?"
"204987124-0-72906";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-72909";"How are you holding up?"
"204987124-0-72910";"She beat you?"
"204987124-0-72911";"What have you heard?"
"204987124-0-72915";"Have you heard any other rumors?"
"204987124-0-72917";"What else can you tell me about the Emerald Eye?"
"204987124-0-72918";"Wouldn't it be faster to work together to clear the way?"
"204987124-0-72920";"Why are you blocking the path?"
"204987124-0-72921";"A relic?"
"204987124-0-72922";"Are you going to hurt Song? How can we trust you?"
"204987124-0-72923";"Who are <<1>> and <<2>>, exactly?"
"204987124-0-72924";"So you're in it for the glory?"
"204987124-0-72926";"What else did you hear?"
"204987124-0-72927";"What do you think it means?"
"204987124-0-72929";"Do you have any plans for the future?"
"204987124-0-72931";"See you, Sir Rayan."
"204987124-0-72932";"How do the visions work?"
"204987124-0-72933";"If you knew all this, why haven't you tried to rescue Song yourself?"
"204987124-0-72934";"Why does this process kill the vessel?"
"204987124-0-72936";"And the two druids we spoke to? What do you think about the information they provided?"
"204987124-0-72937";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-72938";"Without the wards to bind you here, won't you just abandon the grove?"
"204987124-0-72939";"How was Anton selected for the game at Whalefall?"
"204987124-0-72940";"Who did you target?"
"204987124-0-72941";"But then how did you get out here?"
"204987124-0-72942";"Where did the raft come from?"
"204987124-0-72943";"Can you tell me more about Whalefall?"
"204987124-0-72947";"Can you tell me more about Whalefall?"
"204987124-0-72948";"What did the noble do then?"
"204987124-0-72950";"We'll see soon enough."
"204987124-0-72952";"Why do you think Anton won't survive?"
"204987124-0-72953";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-72955";"Let's go to Whalefall and rescue Anton."
"204987124-0-72957";"How did you do that? And why?"
"204987124-0-72958";"If you have sheep, does that mean you're a farmer?"
"204987124-0-72959";"How was that a favor?"
"204987124-0-72960";"Since you have sheep, does that mean you're a farmer?"
"204987124-0-72961";"What was that about the Order of the Albatross?"
"204987124-0-72963";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-72964";"You mentioned you're part of the Stonelore Circle Druids?"
"204987124-0-72966";"I'll help you reset the wards."
"204987124-0-72968";"Enjoy the party."
"204987124-0-72970";"Have a good time, Isobel."
"204987124-0-72971";"Can you tell me more about Whalefall?"
"204987124-0-72972";"Tell me about this game."
"204987124-0-72973";"You mentioned living on Amenos a long time?"
"204987124-0-72974";"You mentioned living on Amenos for a long time?"
"204987124-0-72978";"Can you determine what type of ritual was cast here?"
"204987124-0-72979";"What about the lava vent?"
"204987124-0-72980";"Do you need any assistance?"
"204987124-0-72981";"Do you need any assistance?"
"204987124-0-72984";"And there are no jailers or cells in the jungle?"
"204987124-0-72985";"Thieves, huh? What else aren't you telling me?"
"204987124-0-72988";"You really think beating her in Tribute will change her mind about you?"
"204987124-0-72989";"And if she does manage to make it to you in Elden Root?"
"204987124-0-72991";"What truth is that?"
"204987124-0-72992";"Has Amenos always been a prison?"
"204987124-0-72993";"What else should I know about Amenos?"
"204987124-0-72994";"Everything will turn out fine, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-72995";"I'll keep my eyes open, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-72998";"If what?"
"204987124-0-73000";"How does this processing work exactly?"
"204987124-0-73001";"What old vault?"
"204987124-0-73003";"Are you sure? Maybe that's just a lie the jailers tell the prisoners."
"204987124-0-73007";"Tell me about the ranked matches."
"204987124-0-73009";"What do you do for the Daggerfall Covenant?"
"204987124-0-73010";"Do you know who you are?"
"204987124-0-73012";"Is your love a sea captain?"
"204987124-0-73013";"Why were you talking so strangely?"
"204987124-0-73014";"Why were you talking so strangely?"
"204987124-0-73015";"When what?"
"204987124-0-73016";"We'll go and see what we can learn at the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-73018";"Have you heard from Raenobi since you beat her in the tournament?"
"204987124-0-73020";"Was your love one of the captains that sailed with the All Flags Navy?"
"204987124-0-73022";"Thank you, Dame Madach."
"204987124-0-73024";"Where did you hide your hammer and chisel?"
"204987124-0-73025";"You said something about important happenings?"
"204987124-0-73026";"How does he do that?"
"204987124-0-73027";"Is Oblan unhappy?"
"204987124-0-73028";"So you're a supply courier?"
"204987124-0-73029";"I'd like to know more about you."
"204987124-0-73030";"Can you tell me more about Oblan?"
"204987124-0-73031";"What kind of supplies comes from the coast of a prison island?"
"204987124-0-73032";"But why come here?"
"204987124-0-73033";"I'd like to hear more about Oblan."
"204987124-0-73034";"What makes this coast such a good hiding place?"
"204987124-0-73035";"What made him stop smuggling?"
"204987124-0-73036";"What can you tell me about those smuggler's marks?"
"204987124-0-73037";"What did you mean before about Oblan's old life?"
"204987124-0-73038";"What were in the chests?"
"204987124-0-73039";"Why doesn't Leobert just kneel at the altars and open them himself?"
"204987124-0-73040";"What else can you tell me about Death's Valor Keep?"
"204987124-0-73042";"Where will you go next?"
"204987124-0-73043";"You're part of the Stonelore Circle Druids?"
"204987124-0-73044";"Why did Lord Bacaro decide to host wounded soldiers here?"
"204987124-0-73045";"The shark owns the inn?"
"204987124-0-73047";"How does that make the shark the owner of the inn?"
"204987124-0-73049";"I don't see a mountain here."
"204987124-0-73053";"I've heard of many taverns."
"204987124-0-73056";"Perhaps we'll see each other again someday, Sir Rayan."
"204987124-0-73057";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-73058";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-73059";"Perhaps we'll see each other again someday, Sir Rayan."
"204987124-0-73063";"Who is Armin Demalle?"
"204987124-0-73064";"I'd like to know more about Lord Bacaro's efforts."
"204987124-0-73065";"So you're a couple?"
"204987124-0-73066";"What's so special about this drink you're making?"
"204987124-0-73067";"Then why are you going on about pirates?"
"204987124-0-73068";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-73069";"What's so special about this drink you're making?"
"204987124-0-73073";"What's the purpose of these wards?"
"204987124-0-73077";"You're a fan of romance novels?"
"204987124-0-73078";"Thanks for chatting with me, Isobel."
"204987124-0-73079";"Why did you give that signet ring to Aurelia all those years ago?"
"204987124-0-73082";"Thanks for chatting with me, Isobel."
"204987124-0-73083";"How long had you wanted to become a knight?"
"204987124-0-73084";"Tell me more about the ingredients."
"204987124-0-73085";"How did the two of you get into the business of drink making?"
"204987124-0-73086";"So you don't remember drinking your entire stock?"
"204987124-0-73087";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-73089";"What happens if your missing ships don't turn up?"
"204987124-0-73090";"So why sponsor a conference?"
"204987124-0-73091";"What's so special about these particular ships?"
"204987124-0-73092";"What do you need the map pieces for?"
"204987124-0-73093";"Tell me more about Steadfast Manor."
"204987124-0-73094";"Do fights happen often?"
"204987124-0-73095";"Who is Armin Demalle?"
"204987124-0-73097";"Can you tell me more about this malady?"
"204987124-0-73103";"Does this tourney happen every year?"
"204987124-0-73105";"You're going to wait a year?"
"204987124-0-73106";"So, you defeated her?"
"204987124-0-73108";"You left the pirates alive?"
"204987124-0-73109";"You found a sea of pirates?"
"204987124-0-73111";"You only found a few purses?"
"204987124-0-73112";"That sounds like a long journey."
"204987124-0-73114";"Did he fight that badly?"
"204987124-0-73116";"You attacked fishermen?"
"204987124-0-73118";"You found some coin purses?"
"204987124-0-73119";"I'll go set the traps."
"204987124-0-73122";"And what does this have to do with finding the missing alliance leaders?"
"204987124-0-73123";"You and Kishka are siblings?"
"204987124-0-73124";"Do you ever push back?"
"204987124-0-73126";"Why dedicate your life to hunting vampires?"
"204987124-0-73127";"Closing the chapter on your feelings for Aurelia?"
"204987124-0-73129";"That makes sense."
"204987124-0-73130";"You said you're tracking one specific vampire?"
"204987124-0-73131";"Did anyone else feel that way?"
"204987124-0-73132";"It sounds like House Dufort and House Mornard are rivals."
"204987124-0-73133";"And you do that here on High Isle?"
"204987124-0-73134";"Some vampires aren't so bad."
"204987124-0-73135";"You don't trust me, Mel?"
"204987124-0-73136";"You're tracking a specific vampire?"
"204987124-0-73137";"You're tracking a specific vampire?"
"204987124-0-73140";"What kind of help, exactly?"
"204987124-0-73141";"Tell me about the daily challenges you offer."
"204987124-0-73142";"What do you mean, a monument or museum?"
"204987124-0-73143";"Where's Jhaka?"
"204987124-0-73144";"Where's Jhaka?"
"204987124-0-73145";"Did you run into any trouble while tailing us?"
"204987124-0-73147";"Before they died, the ritual victim called the vampire the Pale Worm."
"204987124-0-73148";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-73149";"I'll see it done, Mel."
"204987124-0-73152";"I remember! It lists sites that Duchess Elea believes are somehow important to the Ascendant Order."
"204987124-0-73153";"Is Jhaka with you?"
"204987124-0-73154";"Are you doing all right, traveling out in the world?"
"204987124-0-73156";"Is Jhaka with you?"
"204987124-0-73158";"Is Silverslip close by?"
"204987124-0-73159";"Outsmarted himself? How?"
"204987124-0-73160";"Is Silverslip close by?"
"204987124-0-73162";"It may be dangerous."
"204987124-0-73164";"So you think peace is still possible?"
"204987124-0-73165";"Dark roots?"
"204987124-0-73166";"You think Lord Bacaro was right?"
"204987124-0-73167";"Do you plan to go forward with the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-73168";"So the peace talks are a failure?"
"204987124-0-73170";"Will Jorunn the Skald-King agree with that decision?"
"204987124-0-73172";"Will you stick around after the party?"
"204987124-0-73177";"Why don't they give them what they want?"
"204987124-0-73178";"I'll take my reward now."
"204987124-0-73179";"<Enter Earthen Root Enclave.>"
"204987124-0-73181";"What's a path-traitor?"
"204987124-0-73188";"How do you plan to learn that?"
"204987124-0-73189";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-73190";"<Enter Graven Deep.>"
"204987124-0-73192";"I'll help you find what made the storm and its connection to the Druid King."
"204987124-0-73197";"A letter indicated the storm was meant to kill, but Valessea thinks they lost control of the ritual."
"204987124-0-73199";"Who were those people on the beach?"
"204987124-0-73200";"Tell me more about Captain Basrush and her ship."
"204987124-0-73201";"I'll talk to Isobel."
"204987124-0-73203";"Tell me more about processing."
"204987124-0-73207";"What happened after your legs were broken?"
"204987124-0-73208";"What do you think about the goal of Steadfast Manor?"
"204987124-0-73209";"Did they help you here?"
"204987124-0-73210";"What do you think now?"
"204987124-0-73211";"What brought you to Steadfast Manor?"
"204987124-0-73212";"You're a sailor?"
"204987124-0-73214";"How did you end up at Steadfast Manor?"
"204987124-0-73215";"You know what all this means?"
"204987124-0-73216";"Where can I find Mender Aldvar?"
"204987124-0-73217";"How do we get Master Healer Viralaine's key?"
"204987124-0-73218";"And to you."
"204987124-0-73220";"We'll find him, Aurelia."
"204987124-0-73222";"Congratulations, Aurelia."
"204987124-0-73223";"Why did Lady Garick create the Trials of Worth?"
"204987124-0-73224";"So when did the trials become about earning the shield?"
"204987124-0-73225";"What makes this shield so valuable?"
"204987124-0-73226";"Why did Lady Garick leave it with you?"
"204987124-0-73227";"Why do you think Amunara wants it?"
"204987124-0-73228";"I'd like to know more about the Trials of Worth."
"204987124-0-73229";"What happened during her last voyage?"
"204987124-0-73230";"What did you do in her absence?"
"204987124-0-73231";"Only for a time?"
"204987124-0-73232";"How did you die?"
"204987124-0-73233";"What can you tell me about the Trials of Worth?"
"204987124-0-73234";"What can you tell me about the Trials of Worth?"
"204987124-0-73235";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-73236";"How does that technique work?"
"204987124-0-73237";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-73238";"Why do you think you failed?"
"204987124-0-73239";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-73241";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73242";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73243";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73244";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73245";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73246";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73247";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73248";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73249";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73252";"About that, are you the author of the Investigator Vale books or not?"
"204987124-0-73253";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-73254";"How long do you think you'll sail with Marso?"
"204987124-0-73255";"I'm glad our journey will continue, Isobel."
"204987124-0-73256";"Take care of each other."
"204987124-0-73258";"Good luck, Aurelia."
"204987124-0-73259";"What about this bag of yours?"
"204987124-0-73260";"Who are these ""lads"" you keep talking to?"
"204987124-0-73261";"I see some scarecrows."
"204987124-0-73262";"Where can I find these items you need?"
"204987124-0-73263";"I see. What does that mean for Mender Roslenn?"
"204987124-0-73264";"Before I go, who are these ""lads"" you keep talking to?"
"204987124-0-73265";"So you were shipwrecked?"
"204987124-0-73266";"And you were the only survivor?"
"204987124-0-73267";"And you've been stuck here for six years?"
"204987124-0-73268";"Are you worried about the Sea Elves finding you up here?"
"204987124-0-73269";"Jimila might be able to get you off the island."
"204987124-0-73270";"How'd you come to be on this island?"
"204987124-0-73271";"Got it, avoid the jailers carrying torches."
"204987124-0-73272";"How do you plan to leave then?"
"204987124-0-73273";"What can you tell me about Ghost Haven Bay?"
"204987124-0-73274";"All right, Oblan and I will blow up the Sea Elves' ship, then meet you at the Prowler."
"204987124-0-73275";"That's how you understand this binding magic?"
"204987124-0-73277";"You sound fairly knowledgeable about the topic."
"204987124-0-73278";"What did Amunara do to you?"
"204987124-0-73280";"What did Amunara do to you?"
"204987124-0-73282";"You think you'll have trouble finding your sea legs again?"
"204987124-0-73283";"So it's a vacation spot for nobles?"
"204987124-0-73284";"What's so special about these particular ships?"
"204987124-0-73285";"A prison for who?"
"204987124-0-73286";"Any other differences?"
"204987124-0-73287";"What exactly is a druid?"
"204987124-0-73288";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-73291";"And you think Lord Bacaro can point us at the most likely suspects?"
"204987124-0-73293";"Do all Breton noble houses have a court mage?"
"204987124-0-73294";"Wonder what?"
"204987124-0-73295";"Let's discuss what we know so far."
"204987124-0-73296";"And how does House Mornard fit into this?"
"204987124-0-73297";"What do you plan to do with the shield?"
"204987124-0-73298";"What do you think it is?"
"204987124-0-73299";"I'm ready if you are."
"204987124-0-73300";"See you there, Mel."
"204987124-0-73301";"Then what is this device?"
"204987124-0-73302";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-73304";"Lady Arabelle is running down some new leads while we work to get the peace talks underway."
"204987124-0-73306";"You haven't spoken to the other leaders?"
"204987124-0-73307";"You'd abandon the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-73309";"Not yet, but Lady Arabelle is running down some new leads. We'll get the peace talks going soon."
"204987124-0-73311";"Tell me more about the fishing holes and scenic spots you marked on my map."
"204987124-0-73312";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-73314";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73315";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73316";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73317";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73318";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73319";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73320";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73321";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73322";"Is there anything else I should know about?"
"204987124-0-73324";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73325";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73326";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73327";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73328";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73329";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73330";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-73331";"Very well. I'll open your cage and get the antidote."
"204987124-0-73332";"Honestly, I thought they were all bad."
"204987124-0-73335";"How are you going to attract wealthy visitors?"
"204987124-0-73337";"I'll take your tour of the Systres Archipelago."
"204987124-0-73344";"You're a historian?"
"204987124-0-73345";"Do you know Archdruid Devyric?"
"204987124-0-73346";"An archdruid?"
"204987124-0-73347";"What's the Dais of Stonesight?"
"204987124-0-73348";"So this is just about making a profit?"
"204987124-0-73350";"You really think people will travel from the mainland just for food?"
"204987124-0-73351";"What do the Druid King's seeds do?"
"204987124-0-73352";"You're a druid?"
"204987124-0-73356";"Why did Archdruid Devyric go through here?"
"204987124-0-73357";"Will the Spirit of Root help Archdruid Devyric find the Stonelore seed?"
"204987124-0-73358";"Where's the seed?"
"204987124-0-73359";"Why's Archdruid Devyric taking Laurel to the Dais of Skytremor?"
"204987124-0-73360";"Why are you so interested in the Druid King specifically?"
"204987124-0-73361";"So it's your responsibility to recover the lost history of the druids?"
"204987124-0-73362";"Tell me about Dhulef's investigation."
"204987124-0-73363";"Did Archdruid Devyric ever say why he wanted the seed?"
"204987124-0-73364";"You're going to restore the enclave?"
"204987124-0-73365";"Will you tell the other druid clans?"
"204987124-0-73366";"What's the Draoife?"
"204987124-0-73369";"How did you find this tablet?"
"204987124-0-73370";"And what does the tablet tell us?"
"204987124-0-73371";"All right, I'll meet you at the Beldama wyrd camp."
"204987124-0-73373";"Do you know where this ritual site is located?"
"204987124-0-73374";"We found orders that Archdruid Michiel received. An archdruid named Orlaith sent him here."
"204987124-0-73375";"We also found this totem in one of the Firesong camps. Dhulef thinks it's a wyrd totem."
"204987124-0-73376";"Yes, he took a charcoal rubbing of the engraving. Here."
"204987124-0-73377";"Do you know where the second ritual site is located?"
"204987124-0-73379";"We're here to help. Wyress Tola of the Beldama sent us to talk to Wyress Sorcha."
"204987124-0-73384";"The Druid King and the wyrds summoned you from the Green? For what purpose?"
"204987124-0-73386";"Sorry, who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-73387";"How is Queen Ayrenn?"
"204987124-0-73388";"Any suggestions on how I should distract the thugs?"
"204987124-0-73389";"How are things in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-73390";"At least you don't have to chase down the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-0-73391";"How are things in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-73392";"How are things in the Summerset Isles?"
"204987124-0-73393";"What's the best way to distract those thugs?"
"204987124-0-73394";"What's Y'ffelon Surprise?"
"204987124-0-73395";"What did she ask you to learn?"
"204987124-0-73396";"That sounds perfect. You see those two over there? It's a surprise for them."
"204987124-0-73398";"[Provisioning] Trust me, I know food. Just look at my recipe list."
"204987124-0-73399";"What's a trellis sentinel?"
"204987124-0-73400";"If you don't know much, why did Druid Laurel ask you to help?"
"204987124-0-73401";"Any more thoughts on the storm that hit us?"
"204987124-0-73402";"Tell me more about the research that brought us here."
"204987124-0-73403";"Are you going to pick a fight?"
"204987124-0-73404";"My friends over there are spoiling for a good fight. See how they're scowling?"
"204987124-0-73406";"They're just over there. Good luck!"
"204987124-0-73408";"Maybe you could play for my friends over there? You'd need to project."
"204987124-0-73410";"Here you go. The louder, the better."
"204987124-0-73411";"What else do you need help with?"
"204987124-0-73412";"Couldn't they have already claimed it?"
"204987124-0-73414";"I'll help you. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-73415";"What kind of lead was he looking into?"
"204987124-0-73417";"I'll help you and your friend Dhulef."
"204987124-0-73418";"What should we do next?"
"204987124-0-73420";"And me?"
"204987124-0-73421";"You believe Dwarves built this place?"
"204987124-0-73422";"So you feel you can complete your survey of the caves now?"
"204987124-0-73423";"Do the pipes factor into this?"
"204987124-0-73425";"Remind me. Who's Lord Bacaro again?"
"204987124-0-73426";"And what does Lord Bacaro have to do with the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-73427";"Can't you let them return to their own kingdoms until we deal with the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-73428";"Tell me about the relief efforts."
"204987124-0-73433";"Would the alliance leaders really abandon the peace talks now?"
"204987124-0-73435";"I'll talk to the alliance leaders and Lord Bacaro."
"204987124-0-73436";"What recent threats?"
"204987124-0-73438";"Duchess Elea? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-73440";"What are you thinking, Lord Bacaro?"
"204987124-0-73442";"Why is that good news?"
"204987124-0-73444";"All right. What's the bad news?"
"204987124-0-73446";"So Grandvache and Redblade are using this spy's notes?"
"204987124-0-73447";"Let's follow those thugs, then."
"204987124-0-73448";"Can you tell me more about Roneiia?"
"204987124-0-73449";"You've dealt with Grandvache before?"
"204987124-0-73450";"What do you know about House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-73451";"Are the minerals and ores on Galen worth a lot?"
"204987124-0-73452";"Any idea who sent you the wine?"
"204987124-0-73453";"I'll figure out who sent the poison, Lady Arabelle."
"204987124-0-73454";"Not yet. He sent me to the Dufort Shipyards. The Ascendant Order is still using them."
"204987124-0-73455";"Any idea who might have sent the poisoned wine to you?"
"204987124-0-73457";"So you were able to nullify the poison?"
"204987124-0-73459";"I'll go see what I can learn at Ashcroft's Fine Goods and Imports."
"204987124-0-73461";"Lady Arabelle received this bottle as a gift, but the wine inside was poisoned."
"204987124-0-73462";"Who placed the order?"
"204987124-0-73465";"Tell me about these hooded figures. Did they give you any names?"
"204987124-0-73468";"Can you tell me where this isolated location was exactly?"
"204987124-0-73469";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-73470";"The wine came from Ashcroft's shop, but someone at Garick's Rest bought it and added the poison."
"204987124-0-73471";"I'll meet you at Garick's Rest."
"204987124-0-73472";"The shipping label said they were destined for Steadfast Manor and contained suits of armor."
"204987124-0-73474";"The letter to the druid alchemist detailed the plan to poison Lady Arabelle and mentioned a garden."
"204987124-0-73475";"What kind of minerals and ores do you think you'll find in there?"
"204987124-0-73476";"What now, Druid Ryvana?"
"204987124-0-73477";"I've got some Tales of Tribute decks, yes."
"204987124-0-73482";"Thanks Raz. I'll see you after the game."
"204987124-0-73485";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-73486";"I'll head out at once, Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-73487";"Are you ready for a fight?"
"204987124-0-73488";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-73493";"What happened here?"
"204987124-0-73497";"Archdruid Devyric can corrupt the spirits?"
"204987124-0-73500";"Why would Lord Bacaro keep a place like this a secret?"
"204987124-0-73502";"You don't sound convinced."
"204987124-0-73503";"Lord Bacaro wanted the Firesong to unite the druids. He wants the circles to crown a new Druid King."
"204987124-0-73504";"I'll examine the carvings."
"204987124-0-73505";"I also found this genealogy. It indicates that Lord Bacaro is a descendant of the last Druid King."
"204987124-0-73511";"I found his journal. He admitted his crimes and claims to be a direct descendant of the Druid King."
"204987124-0-73512";"From what we found under Steadfast Manor, we think he wants to be the next Druid King."
"204987124-0-73513";"What should we do, Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-73515";"Has it really been that bad?"
"204987124-0-73516";"Are there other members of the Elsweyr Defense Force?"
"204987124-0-73517";"Tell me a bit about yourself."
"204987124-0-73518";"What will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-73519";"Is there an optional part?"
"204987124-0-73521";"All right. I'll use the ballistas to drive off the Sea Elf ships."
"204987124-0-73523";"A pirate fleet?"
"204987124-0-73525";"Have you heard anything about the druid settlement at Tuinh?"
"204987124-0-73530";"Who's Druid Laurel again?"
"204987124-0-73531";"Have you heard anything about the druid settlement at Tuinh?"
"204987124-0-73533";"Archdruid Orlaith murdered Rahval and took the Eldertide and Stonelore seeds."
"204987124-0-73536";"The Firesong attacked Earthen Root Enclave and tried to capture Frii in Glenmoril."
"204987124-0-73539";"All right. I'll tell Sir Stefan what we learned here."
"204987124-0-73545";"Thanks for the information. I'd better get started."
"204987124-0-73546";"What's the last trial?"
"204987124-0-73549";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-73552";"I'll head to Vastyr and help Count Stefan."
"204987124-0-73553";"What happens if Lord Bacaro gets all three items of the Druid King's regalia?"
"204987124-0-73554";"I have no idea."
"204987124-0-73555";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-73556";"And the druid circles would accept him as their king?"
"204987124-0-73557";"Why can't we just start the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-73558";"Forest wraiths?"
"204987124-0-73559";"Sir Stefan mentioned captives."
"204987124-0-73560";"Do you know where we can find Druid Fenas, Octin?"
"204987124-0-73561";"I'll scout the cave and look for the captives."
"204987124-0-73562";"For awhile?"
"204987124-0-73563";"Sir Stefan Mornard sent me to find these captives."
"204987124-0-73564";"Where did Sealord Nalos go?"
"204987124-0-73566";"I'll tell Sir Stefan what you said."
"204987124-0-73567";"Does this change the mission?"
"204987124-0-73568";"What is the Deeproot?"
"204987124-0-73569";"Are you sure you can cleanse it?"
"204987124-0-73570";"Voices of the roots?"
"204987124-0-73571";"How are we going to find the bequest? We didn't learn anything from Grandvache."
"204987124-0-73573";"Let's take a look at the letters, then."
"204987124-0-73575";"What's the Spirit of Stone?"
"204987124-0-73576";"How will that help him get the Stonelore seed?"
"204987124-0-73577";"Path-traitor?"
"204987124-0-73578";"How do you think the rest of your circle will react to Frii?"
"204987124-0-73579";"Do you think Druid Laurel's decision to take Frii to Galen is the right one?"
"204987124-0-73581";"Sealord Nalos is looking for the Eldertide sacred seed. He's trying to find it for a Firesong Druid."
"204987124-0-73583";"That's not all. Firesong Druids have struck at the Stonelore Circle, too."
"204987124-0-73585";"I'll talk to Druid Laurel."
"204987124-0-73586";"What about Count Mornard? Will he attend, too?"
"204987124-0-73587";"The Eldertide Druids of High Isle are openly hostile."
"204987124-0-73588";"Why would the Draoife invite you to observe?"
"204987124-0-73589";"Can you tell me more about these sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-73590";"All right, I'll meet you at the Telling Stone."
"204987124-0-73593";"What did your knight find?"
"204987124-0-73594";"Why bury the treasure? Isn't that a lot of gold to give up?"
"204987124-0-73595";"We discovered that Lord Bacaro is their Ascendant Lord. He wants the Druid King's regalia."
"204987124-0-73596";"It could be the Ascendant Order. They recently stole armor from the society."
"204987124-0-73598";"All right. How do we collapse the cavern?"
"204987124-0-73599";"Where were you when the intruders arrived?"
"204987124-0-73600";"One charge per pillar. Got it."
"204987124-0-73601";"How does Octin know which is the right sacred tree?"
"204987124-0-73604";"So what exactly do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-73605";"You really think people will travel from the mainland just for food?"
"204987124-0-73606";"And how's Octin doing?"
"204987124-0-73607";"I accept."
"204987124-0-73609";"Alduin."
"204987124-0-73612";"He wants to be crowned as the new Druid King. Replace the Ruby Throne with the Ivy Throne."
"204987124-0-73613";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-73614";"Lady Arabelle has gone to the Stonelore encampment to warn Druid Laurel."
"204987124-0-73616";"Ferrying supplies and the wounded is one thing. Will she agree to fight alongside us again?"
"204987124-0-73619";"I choose you, Joslin. Touch the tablet."
"204987124-0-73620";"I choose you, Octin. Touch the tablet."
"204987124-0-73626";"Werewolves."
"204987124-0-73627";"Why do you think she's sad?"
"204987124-0-73628";"I'll follow Archdruid Devyric."
"204987124-0-73629";"You're a druid?"
"204987124-0-73632";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-73633";"Tell me more about Dhulef. How do you know him?"
"204987124-0-73634";"What kinds of stories?"
"204987124-0-73635";"What's so important about tracing the path of the Druid King?"
"204987124-0-73637";"What did you do then?"
"204987124-0-73638";"Count Stefan is fine. Where's Lady Arabelle now?"
"204987124-0-73639";"Then what happened, Laurel?"
"204987124-0-73640";"You said he claimed to be the new Druid King. What happens now?"
"204987124-0-73641";"Tell me more about the Green Scourge."
"204987124-0-73642";"Bad in what way, Laurel?"
"204987124-0-73643";"What's so important about tracing the path of the Druid King?"
"204987124-0-73644";"Do you think this is what the Firesong are looking for?"
"204987124-0-73645";"What will you do with the seed?"
"204987124-0-73646";"Why is someone from the Mages Guild working with a druid?"
"204987124-0-73647";"What will you do about the seed?"
"204987124-0-73648";"So you're working off a debt?"
"204987124-0-73649";"Why did the wyress send you to find this tablet?"
"204987124-0-73654";"These sites aren't safe."
"204987124-0-73655";"This tablet that Wyress Tola sent Dhulef to examine. Do you know what these symbols mean?"
"204987124-0-73656";"Did you notice anything else when Archdruid Michiel took the wyress?"
"204987124-0-73657";"When did you first notice druid camps appearing in the area?"
"204987124-0-73658";"By fighting Dragons?"
"204987124-0-73660";"Are you planning to return home then?"
"204987124-0-73661";"You came back to help?"
"204987124-0-73662";"We'll do what we can, wyress."
"204987124-0-73663";"Tell me about mineral surveying."
"204987124-0-73664";"How do you suggest we get rid of the crystals?"
"204987124-0-73665";"I'll try smashing the druid crystal."
"204987124-0-73668";"What about Frii? Were they with him?"
"204987124-0-73669";"What about you? We need to get you off of that pressure plate."
"204987124-0-73673";"How has Dhulef helped with your recovery?"
"204987124-0-73678";"Do you really think Dhulef's in danger?"
"204987124-0-73679";"Why are the Firesong Druids after Dhulef?"
"204987124-0-73680";"What exactly is the Elsweyr Defense Force?"
"204987124-0-73682";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-73686";"Why is this your fault?"
"204987124-0-73687";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-73689";"Does Dhulef's investigation have anything to do with the logbook we found at Graven Deep?"
"204987124-0-73690";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-73691";"Why did the wyress send you to find this tablet?"
"204987124-0-73692";"There's a Druid King?"
"204987124-0-73693";"Are all corrupted nature spirits aggressive?"
"204987124-0-73694";"So your father rules Galen?"
"204987124-0-73695";"Eldertide Circle?"
"204987124-0-73696";"You studied with the druids?"
"204987124-0-73697";"Tell me about Windwrack Fort."
"204987124-0-73698";"What can you tell me about the druid village?"
"204987124-0-73699";"Tell me about Windwrack Fort."
"204987124-0-73700";"Tell me about Windwrack Fort."
"204987124-0-73701";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-73702";"A second home to you?"
"204987124-0-73703";"Who leads these pirates?"
"204987124-0-73706";"Why would the tablet blame you?"
"204987124-0-73709";"Why would he specifically require a wyress?"
"204987124-0-73711";"The barons in ivy robes?"
"204987124-0-73714";"Why are the seeds so important? Are they powerful?"
"204987124-0-73715";"The Draoife?"
"204987124-0-73717";"Tell me more about Galen."
"204987124-0-73719";"What does a court mage do?"
"204987124-0-73720";"Treasure-hunting?"
"204987124-0-73721";"Where should I look for Umindior?"
"204987124-0-73727";"Do the Stonelore have cities, too?"
"204987124-0-73728";"Where do you think Lord Bacaro went?"
"204987124-0-73731";"No, but if you know anything that can help me find Sir Stefan, you need to tell me."
"204987124-0-73732";"I'll try to rescue all of them—Druid Niraya, the sacred seed, and Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-73733";"And what aren't you telling me, archdruid?"
"204987124-0-73734";"What does this training involve?"
"204987124-0-73736";"I'll participate in the training."
"204987124-0-73737";"The trials of knowledge, endurance, and bravery, right?"
"204987124-0-73738";"I'll take the trials once more."
"204987124-0-73740";"Why wouldn't the Eldertide Druids want your help?"
"204987124-0-73743";"How are you after the attack at Draoife Dell?"
"204987124-0-73744";"The way Frii slumbered before the Firesong awakened them?"
"204987124-0-73745";"You know for sure that Sir Stefan is in the keep?"
"204987124-0-73746";"What exactly does this prophecy say?"
"204987124-0-73747";"Archdruid Ellic told me about a secret entrance to the dungeons. I'll sneak in."
"204987124-0-73749";"All right. Maybe I'll see you inside."
"204987124-0-73750";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-73751";"What do you think all this means?"
"204987124-0-73752";"Why did you decide to take Frii to Galen?"
"204987124-0-73753";"Some of them seemed pretty dangerous."
"204987124-0-73754";"Some of them seemed pretty dangerous."
"204987124-0-73755";"Some of them seemed pretty dangerous."
"204987124-0-73758";"Good or ill? You think the return of the Druid King might be bad?"
"204987124-0-73759";"Which interpretation do you think is correct?"
"204987124-0-73760";"Why was Kasorayn the last druid king?"
"204987124-0-73761";"What do you think the Dream of Kasorayn means?"
"204987124-0-73763";"What prophecy?"
"204987124-0-73764";"Why would the Firesong try to take your circle's sacred seed?"
"204987124-0-73767";"Remind me again about the additional challenge."
"204987124-0-73770";"Flying."
"204987124-0-73771";"How do I get you out of this cell?"
"204987124-0-73773";"He carries the key on his person?"
"204987124-0-73774";"Archdruid Ellic told Niraya to hide the Eldertide seed in these ruins."
"204987124-0-73776";"All right, let's go."
"204987124-0-73777";"We can still stop Sealord Nalos. Where is the shrine?"
"204987124-0-73779";"I'll find the shrine and retrieve the Eldertide seed."
"204987124-0-73780";"And what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-73783";"Thanks for giving us the warning."
"204987124-0-73784";"The Dreadsails plan to attack Vastyr. The seed might not be safe here."
"204987124-0-73786";"I'll go see Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-73790";"I'll talk to Captain Siravaen."
"204987124-0-73792";"We helped you defeat Sealord Nalos and get your crew and ship back."
"204987124-0-73794";"How's this? If Lord Bacaro and his allies take control, no port in the islands will be safe for you."
"204987124-0-73797";"We haven't seen any Firesong Druids yet."
"204987124-0-73800";"Do you know of another entrance we can use?"
"204987124-0-73804";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-73805";"Tunnels? Is this what you were hesitant about? That there are tunnels hidden behind the waterfalls?"
"204987124-0-73806";"Did Neri mention the location of the relic?"
"204987124-0-73807";"I'll recover the everflame torch and meet you at Veil's Bluff."
"204987124-0-73808";"Where did the Dreadsails take the everflame torch?"
"204987124-0-73810";"All right, I'll go talk to some imprisoned Sea Elves."
"204987124-0-73811";"Do people usually behave like Neri toward you?"
"204987124-0-73816";"To stop Archdruid Orlaith and return the seeds to you. Where are they, Frii?"
"204987124-0-73818";"What's on the other side of this door?"
"204987124-0-73820";"You mean the door to the Ivy Throne?"
"204987124-0-73822";"Do you remember King Kasorayn?"
"204987124-0-73824";"And what will the elixir do?"
"204987124-0-73826";"Our misguided brothers and sisters?"
"204987124-0-73828";"How do I help Elder Verline?"
"204987124-0-73830";"I'm listening, my king."
"204987124-0-73832";"You think Urdiir the Guardian is still there?"
"204987124-0-73834";"What do you think we should do?"
"204987124-0-73836";"What does that mean, Frii?"
"204987124-0-73838";"I'm not sure, but I don't think Frii is coming back. They're part of Mount Firesong now."
"204987124-0-73845";"Tell me more about this torch and beacon."
"204987124-0-73847";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-73851";"When was the last time the beacon was lit?"
"204987124-0-73852";"What about the druids? Don't you need help getting them to Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-73853";"I'll go to Clohaigh and check on Frii."
"204987124-0-73854";"What about the Eldertide? I should speak to Archdruid Ellic, too."
"204987124-0-73855";"All right, but what's in Glimmertarn?"
"204987124-0-73856";"Yes, I retrieved the everflame torch."
"204987124-0-73858";"The archdruid said you came here with Frii?"
"204987124-0-73861";"Are the sacred seeds really the regalia of the Druid King?"
"204987124-0-73862";"I'll take the sacred seed."
"204987124-0-73863";"I'll speak to Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-73866";"Why is a meeting between the Druid King and the wyrds significant?"
"204987124-0-73867";"How did you convince Druid Fenas to help you?"
"204987124-0-73869";"No pay."
"204987124-0-73877";"You were stealing from a druid?"
"204987124-0-73878";"If Octin broke the tablet, how come you got cursed, too?"
"204987124-0-73882";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-73883";"I'll go find the siltcrabs."
"204987124-0-73887";"Why not get Umindior to find some other delicacy as well?"
"204987124-0-73891";"All right, I'll use the freezing spell to retrieve a fire shard."
"204987124-0-73892";"We saw the Firesong kill Eldertide Druids. Could that have something to do with this?"
"204987124-0-73893";"No prey."
"204987124-0-73895";"Why is Archdruid Orlaith doing all this?"
"204987124-0-73897";"And you don't believe in that interpretation?"
"204987124-0-73898";"Y'ffelon is the Firesong island, right?"
"204987124-0-73899";"I don't know for certain."
"204987124-0-73900";"Tell me about your vendetta against Sealord Nalos."
"204987124-0-73902";"And you didn't know the druids are divided into different circles?"
"204987124-0-73903";"Shouldn't we just keep Frii away from the Firesong Circle?"
"204987124-0-73904";"You're worried about Druid Laurel?"
"204987124-0-73906";"What other reason?"
"204987124-0-73907";"Why don't you know?"
"204987124-0-73908";"Do any of the druidic circles still use Ivyhame?"
"204987124-0-73909";"Would the seeds go back to sleep if we separated them again?"
"204987124-0-73910";"I don't understand. Do you have a choice or not?"
"204987124-0-73913";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-73917";"What choice did Druid King Kasorayn want you to make?"
"204987124-0-73918";"You said you have a choice. What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-73921";"Your dream? The Sower?"
"204987124-0-73922";"How will you return the regalia to Y'ffre?"
"204987124-0-73923";"Frii is waiting in the druid district. We saw a vision of the last Druid King's death at Ivyhame."
"204987124-0-73924";"I'll turn the druid stones as you instructed."
"204987124-0-73925";"What of Elder Verline and the servants of the Allwither?"
"204987124-0-73926";"How do I summon Urdiir the Guardian?"
"204987124-0-73928";"What happened during your scouting?"
"204987124-0-73931";"It seems like figuring out these riddles is easier than you first thought."
"204987124-0-73935";"Is there a way to return your wife to her original form?"
"204987124-0-73940";"Minahel's note mentioned a way to control the relic's effects."
"204987124-0-73942";"Tell me more about Graven Deep."
"204987124-0-73943";"Why do you want to go to Graven Deep?"
"204987124-0-73944";"You don't seem to have a lot of respect for the druids."
"204987124-0-73945";"Sir Stefan seems very involved with druids."
"204987124-0-73946";"Would the Firesong take Sir Stefan off the island?"
"204987124-0-73947";"How many druid circles are there?"
"204987124-0-73948";"Lady Arabelle was poisoned. The wine was part of a large order your seneschal placed recently."
"204987124-0-73949";"Lord Bacaro seemed to think otherwise."
"204987124-0-73950";"What about the Ascendant Order? They control the Dufort Shipyards."
"204987124-0-73951";"I should examine the gift you received."
"204987124-0-73953";"Can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-73955";"Impressive. Where do you practice your skills?"
"204987124-0-73957";"Let me discuss your skills with my friend."
"204987124-0-73958";"What do you plan to do about the relic?"
"204987124-0-73960";"Impressive. We both think so!"
"204987124-0-73961";"Yes, but we're no closer to figuring out who sent the poisoned wine."
"204987124-0-73962";"I'll help you find Gwenaelle and talk to the Chronicle."
"204987124-0-73963";"I'll go talk to the courier."
"204987124-0-73966";"You think the Ascendant Order sent the poisoned wine?"
"204987124-0-73968";"Veshin said the sea witches study in some caves here."
"204987124-0-73970";"I'll be back shortly."
"204987124-0-73971";"What is this island?"
"204987124-0-73972";"I'll look for the magic sail cloth and meet you on the cliffs."
"204987124-0-73975";"How so?"
"204987124-0-73976";"Tell me a bit about yourself."
"204987124-0-73978";"After we get the relic, should we find Umindior?"
"204987124-0-73980";"Let's go get that relic."
"204987124-0-73981";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-73983";"Do you hate Dragons?"
"204987124-0-73984";"And you think you can open the door that Archdruid Orlaith couldn't?"
"204987124-0-73987";"How long can Lady Arabelle hold on without an antidote?"
"204987124-0-73989";"I also found this shard stone. Do you recognize it?"
"204987124-0-73990";"So you're claiming that the Society of the Steadfast has nothing to do with the Ascendant Order?"
"204987124-0-73991";"I'll see if I notice anything out of the ordinary in the cellars."
"204987124-0-74102";"All right. How do I sign up for one of these jobs?"
"204987124-0-74103";"Sounds like you're proud to serve House Mornard."
"204987124-0-74104";"Tell me more about the jobs Druid Gastoc offers."
"204987124-0-74105";"Tell me more about the jobs Juline Courcelles offers."
"204987124-0-74107";"Tell me more about the jobs Juline Courcelles offers."
"204987124-0-74108";"Are you handling contracts for House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-74110";"Of course. Here's the relic."
"204987124-0-74115";"Give me the long version."
"204987124-0-74116";"I take it that did not go well?"
"204987124-0-74117";"You're fairly memorable, Mel."
"204987124-0-74118";"Into the Pale Worm."
"204987124-0-74119";"I'll see you there, Mel."
"204987124-0-74123";"Well, good luck with that, Octin."
"204987124-0-74124";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-74127";"Well, good luck, Joslin."
"204987124-0-74130";"And what will you be doing?"
"204987124-0-74131";"Who's Druid Madena?"
"204987124-0-74132";"How do we choose who to restore?"
"204987124-0-74133";"How does it show you these stories, exactly?"
"204987124-0-74134";"What animals?"
"204987124-0-74136";"Why don't they attack the Firesong?"
"204987124-0-74145";"Is Y'ffre's Path safe now?"
"204987124-0-74146";"You would have attacked your own husband?"
"204987124-0-74147";"Firesong Druids attacked and destroyed it. They killed many of the Stonelore Druids there."
"204987124-0-74148";"Druid Laurel is safe. I drove out the Firesong Druids."
"204987124-0-74149";"How do you know Druid Laurel?"
"204987124-0-74150";"How'd she do that?"
"204987124-0-74151";"What happened after Druid Laurel saved you?"
"204987124-0-74152";"I've met Druid Laurel. I helped her at Earthen Root Enclave."
"204987124-0-74153";"Did you believe the legend?"
"204987124-0-74154";"Any more thoughts on the storm that hit us?"
"204987124-0-74156";"Why did you join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-74157";"What did magic do for you?"
"204987124-0-74158";"Did you stop working as a pirate?"
"204987124-0-74159";"Why did you join the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-74160";"Why is a meeting between the Druid King and the wyrds significant?"
"204987124-0-74161";"You mentioned circles. Tell me about those."
"204987124-0-74162";"Do you know anything else?"
"204987124-0-74163";"So you believe they built this place?"
"204987124-0-74164";"And the Firesongs?"
"204987124-0-74165";"Why is a meeting between the Druid King and the wyrds significant?"
"204987124-0-74166";"Why is a meeting between the Druid King and the wyrds significant?"
"204987124-0-74168";"You mentioned circles. Tell me about those."
"204987124-0-74171";"Why didn't you go with Dhulef to meet with the wyrds?"
"204987124-0-74172";"Remind me about this prophecy."
"204987124-0-74173";"Would the druids really believe that?"
"204987124-0-74175";"When did you first notice druid camps appearing in the area?"
"204987124-0-74176";"What's the connection between the Firesong Circle and Mount Firesong?"
"204987124-0-74177";"Did Archdruid Orlaith wake up the volcano?"
"204987124-0-74178";"Why do you have to stay in Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74179";"Why do you have to stay in Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74180";"When Archdruid Orlaith took the seeds, she said she was going to become the new Druid King."
"204987124-0-74181";"We defeated Sealord Nalos and drove off the remaining Dreadsails. The city is safe for now."
"204987124-0-74183";"What were you doing in those waters?"
"204987124-0-74184";"Spirit motes?"
"204987124-0-74185";"You and your wife are Eldertide Druids?"
"204987124-0-74186";"What is this place, exactly?"
"204987124-0-74187";"How do you know she didn't escape, too?"
"204987124-0-74189";"Could the Firesong Druids be responsible for all this?"
"204987124-0-74190";"You and your wife are Eldertide Druids?"
"204987124-0-74191";"Then let's find the seeds, Frii."
"204987124-0-74193";"She wants me to post these handbills to recruit Sea Elf tour guides."
"204987124-0-74195";"All right. Frii and I will try to find this Ivy Throne."
"204987124-0-74196";"Who was Druid Madena?"
"204987124-0-74197";"All right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-74198";"Why are you willing to help with this sort of thing?"
"204987124-0-74201";"Do you think the other druid circles will ever seek harmony with you?"
"204987124-0-74202";"Are they spirits or trees?"
"204987124-0-74203";"All right. Let's look around for druid stones."
"204987124-0-74204";"All right, let's head to Hag Fen."
"204987124-0-74206";"The mage? You mean Dhulef?"
"204987124-0-74209";"Tell me about the forest wraith."
"204987124-0-74210";"What should I know before facing one?"
"204987124-0-74215";"Very well. Let's go."
"204987124-0-74216";"What do you think you'll find here?"
"204987124-0-74217";"Very well. Let's go."
"204987124-0-74219";"Can you tell me anything about the ritual the archdruid performed here?"
"204987124-0-74221";"Thanks for your help, wyress."
"204987124-0-74222";"I'll gather the herbs."
"204987124-0-74223";"Monsters? What kind of monsters?"
"204987124-0-74227";"She also requests that you bring a contingent of House Mornard knights."
"204987124-0-74228";"Perfectly. We'll see you at All Flags Islet, Count Stefan."
"204987124-0-74230";"Where will you two go?"
"204987124-0-74233";"Do you know where the Firesong took Wyress Sorcha?"
"204987124-0-74236";"Do we need to find him?"
"204987124-0-74238";"Good. We'll see you at All Flags Islet on High Isle."
"204987124-0-74239";"You're battling the Gray Host?"
"204987124-0-74240";"Where are the other Eldertide and Stonelore Druids?"
"204987124-0-74241";"All right. Lord Bacaro is gathering people at the cathedral. Go there. You'll be safe."
"204987124-0-74243";"Was Archdruid Rahval hurt when the two of you got separated?"
"204987124-0-74244";"I'll find Archdruid Rahval."
"204987124-0-74245";"Are you sure you have no idea where I should look?"
"204987124-0-74246";"All right. Let's hunt some vampires."
"204987124-0-74247";"We'll see you on All Flags Islet, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-74249";"Archdruid Orlaith knew about you. Does she know about the guardian?"
"204987124-0-74250";"Let's find Druid Laurel."
"204987124-0-74252";"So why is this cloud of motes dangerous?"
"204987124-0-74253";"Archdruid Orlaith demands we send you to her or she'll kill Druid Laurel and her other captives."
"204987124-0-74255";"If we're not sailing with Dhulef and Frii, how will we get to Y'ffelon?"
"204987124-0-74256";"Are you expecting trouble on the journey?"
"204987124-0-74257";"How is this going to work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-74258";"What comes next?"
"204987124-0-74259";"All right. I'll rescue the captives, and then meet you in the temple."
"204987124-0-74260";"Could they be in the tomb of King Kasorayn?"
"204987124-0-74261";"But the leaders of the three druid circles are dead."
"204987124-0-74269";"Can the city withstand such an assault?"
"204987124-0-74270";"What's the situation in Vastyr right now?"
"204987124-0-74271";"Why send me, exactly?"
"204987124-0-74273";"I'll meet Captain Siravaen and help her recover her ship."
"204987124-0-74274";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-74275";"How did they capture your ship?"
"204987124-0-74276";"I'm surprised they left any Dreadsails behind. I assumed they'd all be part of the armada."
"204987124-0-74277";"I'll cut the mooring lines and release the harbor chain to free your ship."
"204987124-0-74278";"Of course."
"204987124-0-74279";"I'll head below decks."
"204987124-0-74283";"Can't you just appeal to the jailers and tell them they made a mistake?"
"204987124-0-74284";"If the Firesong betrayed him, why give them one of the sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-74285";"All right, I'll help you get your husband out of the prison stockade."
"204987124-0-74287";"You said you have a choice. What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-74289";"Of course. I'd be happy to talk to the alliance leaders."
"204987124-0-74294";"Who are the sea witches you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-74295";"The preparations and the druids didn't help at all?"
"204987124-0-74296";"All right, I'll meet you in Vastyr."
"204987124-0-74297";"Juline asked me to travel to Embervine and make sketches of what I find there."
"204987124-0-74300";"She doesn't respect Embervine? How so?"
"204987124-0-74303";"Tell me more about yourself, Quen."
"204987124-0-74311";"You think you can convince Captain Siravaen to help?"
"204987124-0-74312";"Can you still sense the sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-74313";"Can't you choose not to regrow the seeds?"
"204987124-0-74314";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-74315";"What will become of Urdiir the Guardian?"
"204987124-0-74316";"Why are you helping us? I thought you were done here."
"204987124-0-74317";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-74318";"So you've been to the Temple of Y'ffelon?"
"204987124-0-74324";"How do we stop the followers of the Allwither?"
"204987124-0-74325";"I'll escort you to the ritual chamber."
"204987124-0-74326";"Who's Elder Verline?"
"204987124-0-74328";"Who created them?"
"204987124-0-74329";"Even though the Druid King created them, you're fine with people killing them?"
"204987124-0-74332";"You don't need to thank me, Count Stefan."
"204987124-0-74333";"Any thoughts on the second riddle?"
"204987124-0-74334";"I'll take the seeds and deliver them to the circles."
"204987124-0-74335";"That's good. It means Gwenaelle might still be alive. Didn't Senna's note also mention a waterfall?"
"204987124-0-74341";"You've run into lava before?"
"204987124-0-74344";"What's your plan now?"
"204987124-0-74345";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-74346";"<Enter Bal Sunnar.>"
"204987124-0-74348";"I'll join your search for the temporal distortion in Bal Sunnar."
"204987124-0-74356";"Why wouldn't you be able to stay a druid?"
"204987124-0-74359";"Your son didn't listen to the warnings from the druids?"
"204987124-0-74360";"Why did she want to study the Fauns?"
"204987124-0-74361";"Can't you give him to a new herd?"
"204987124-0-74362";"And you really think these seeds are the answer?"
"204987124-0-74364";"How long has your son worked as a hireling?"
"204987124-0-74365";"And how will that help the Fauns?"
"204987124-0-74366";"What do you think of their story?"
"204987124-0-74368";"I'll meet you at the druid cavern."
"204987124-0-74369";"You're a druid?"
"204987124-0-74372";"Any hints on the first riddle?"
"204987124-0-74373";"What one thing was that?"
"204987124-0-74375";"Where's the relic now?"
"204987124-0-74376";"So he sees you as his mother?"
"204987124-0-74377";"Who was Druid Madena?"
"204987124-0-74379";"One wrong move and what?"
"204987124-0-74380";"I guess so. What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-74381";"Do you think that will be enough?"
"204987124-0-74382";"Siravaen wants to kill Sealord Nalos. If he leads the attack, Vastyr would provide the opportunity."
"204987124-0-74383";"How will you make sure Vastyr is safe?"
"204987124-0-74384";"No, just the flowers."
"204987124-0-74387";"Why did the lich continue creating storms?"
"204987124-0-74388";"What do you know about the wyrd mentioned in the logbook?"
"204987124-0-74389";"Why is it important that the Druid King met with the wyrds?"
"204987124-0-74390";"You said you believed the storms came from this machine?"
"204987124-0-74391";"You believe the storms came from this machine?"
"204987124-0-74392";"I just want to know what happened when you were attacked by the chimera."
"204987124-0-74393";"Has Frii learned anything from studying the seed?"
"204987124-0-74394";"Is the Stonelore seed still safe, archdruid?"
"204987124-0-74395";"Were each of the initiates attacked by a different head?"
"204987124-0-74396";"I've been asked to gather samples from the chimera for some sort of cure for you."
"204987124-0-74398";"Fine, I'm going."
"204987124-0-74399";"Do the Stonelore worship at these shrines?"
"204987124-0-74400";"Is Y'ffre's Path really so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-74401";"Tell me more about the chimera."
"204987124-0-74403";"Recent events?"
"204987124-0-74407";"Where should I look for the archdruids?"
"204987124-0-74408";"What do you mean by only a druid can undo the curse?"
"204987124-0-74409";"We don't want you to do that. Just stall her. We'll rescue the captives then come to get you."
"204987124-0-74410";"Dhulef is coming to take you to a ship. Go with him. The rest of us will take a different vessel."
"204987124-0-74411";"You're not going to stay here and keep an eye on them?"
"204987124-0-74412";"But they found the tablet while robbing another druid."
"204987124-0-74413";"I'll find Archdruid Ellic."
"204987124-0-74414";"How will Mohair know?"
"204987124-0-74416";"What will you and Mohair do next?"
"204987124-0-74420";"Why are the druids helping the city?"
"204987124-0-74423";"Aren't you looking to study phoenix moths?"
"204987124-0-74426";"He asked me to deal with the wraith and collect the moths for you."
"204987124-0-74428";"What did the Firesong Druids want with Frii?"
"204987124-0-74429";"Have you figured out why the Firesong Druids want Frii?"
"204987124-0-74431";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-74432";"You don't trust Lady Juline?"
"204987124-0-74433";"Why are you so interested in these radiant cores?"
"204987124-0-74436";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-74438";"Why would a druid have a cursed tablet?"
"204987124-0-74440";"If Octin broke the tablet, how come you got cursed, too?"
"204987124-0-74441";"I'll go get the fire shard and the sap from the sacred tree."
"204987124-0-74442";"Do you really think people will stop looking for the treasure?"
"204987124-0-74443";"How can you read the writing?"
"204987124-0-74444";"Why are you helping Octin and Joslin?"
"204987124-0-74447";"I'll tell Captain Siravaen to take me to the Mad Maiden."
"204987124-0-74448";"I'll board the skiff when I'm ready."
"204987124-0-74449";"What detail is that?"
"204987124-0-74450";"Tell me more about the peace talks."
"204987124-0-74451";"Of course. Here. Take the fire shard and the sacred sap."
"204987124-0-74453";"There was nothing we could do to stop the cathedral from collapsing."
"204987124-0-74455";"Do you think these talks will end the Three Banners War?"
"204987124-0-74456";"There must be some way to stop this."
"204987124-0-74462";"I'll head below."
"204987124-0-74471";"How did you manage to get captured, Laurel?"
"204987124-0-74472";"Yes. Frii and I found it. Here you go."
"204987124-0-74475";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-74478";"I'll talk to Archdruid Rahval."
"204987124-0-74479";"What about the Druid King's regalia?"
"204987124-0-74480";"As you say, Frii."
"204987124-0-74481";"We saved Archdruid Rahval and Archdruid Ellic from the Dreadsails."
"204987124-0-74482";"Archdruid Orlaith promised to grant him a stronghold on Galen, according to orders we found."
"204987124-0-74483";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-74484";"By performing these jobs for you?"
"204987124-0-74487";"This is all because of the Sea Elves?"
"204987124-0-74488";"I'll talk to Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-74490";"Why are these vents acting up now?"
"204987124-0-74491";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-74492";"Are there many Redguard members of the Stonelore Circle?"
"204987124-0-74493";"Are there many Redguard members of the Stonelore Circle?"
"204987124-0-74494";"So how'd you wind up helping House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-74495";"Tell me more about these Sea Elves."
"204987124-0-74496";"Did Captain Siravaen say anything else?"
"204987124-0-74498";"You're not worried about your chances?"
"204987124-0-74499";"Tell me more about these Sea Elves."
"204987124-0-74500";"A Firesong named Archdruid Michiel attacked the Glenmoril Wyrds."
"204987124-0-74501";"What about Captain Siravaen and her Gilded Blades?"
"204987124-0-74502";"What will you do to make sure Vastyr is safe?"
"204987124-0-74503";"So the Eldertide and Firesong are evil druids?"
"204987124-0-74504";"One more question. Why are the druid circles quarreling now?"
"204987124-0-74505";"What about Frii and Druid Laurel? Are they here?"
"204987124-0-74506";"One more question. Why are the druid circles quarreling now?"
"204987124-0-74507";"What did the Stonelore Circle do with their sacred seed?"
"204987124-0-74508";"One more question. Why are the druid circles quarreling now?"
"204987124-0-74509";"One more question. Why are the druid circles quarreling now?"
"204987124-0-74510";"Tell me more about these Sea Elves."
"204987124-0-74511";"Will the Stonelore agree to help defend Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74512";"What was that about druid quarrels?"
"204987124-0-74515";"Are the Eldertide Druids here going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-74516";"Did they take anything?"
"204987124-0-74517";"This is all because of the Sea Elves?"
"204987124-0-74518";"I'll talk to Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-74520";"What about the Stonelore and Firesong Circles? Do they feel the same?"
"204987124-0-74521";"So your father rules Galen?"
"204987124-0-74522";"Tell me about these locations that are under attack."
"204987124-0-74525";"Who leads these pirates?"
"204987124-0-74526";"Sir Stefan said there were Sea Elves near Suncleft Cove."
"204987124-0-74529";"What would you have done if I hadn't?"
"204987124-0-74530";"So that means …?"
"204987124-0-74531";"Sir Stefan said that the Dreadsails were unusually determined."
"204987124-0-74532";"Druid Laurel and I will find them, Za'ji."
"204987124-0-74534";"Why are the seeds so important? Are they powerful?"
"204987124-0-74535";"Why are the seeds so important? Are they powerful?"
"204987124-0-74536";"Why are the seeds important? Are they powerful?"
"204987124-0-74537";"What happened after she found you?"
"204987124-0-74538";"Yes. He decided to head back to Glimmertarn."
"204987124-0-74539";"Do you think all the druid circles can be trusted?"
"204987124-0-74540";"And are we ready to start the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-74541";"You want Za'ji and Caska to participate in the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-74542";"Is it safe for you to leave Vastyr right now?"
"204987124-0-74544";"Frii the nature spirit? All right, I'll meet you at the Telling Stone."
"204987124-0-74545";"According to the prophecy, how would this Green Scourge come about?"
"204987124-0-74546";"Where will the Draoife take place?"
"204987124-0-74547";"How do the sacred seeds fit in?"
"204987124-0-74548";"What is your purpose, Frii?"
"204987124-0-74549";"Where will the Draoife take place?"
"204987124-0-74550";"How do the sacred seeds fit in?"
"204987124-0-74552";"All right. I'll go after Lord Bacaro and Frii."
"204987124-0-74553";"The Stonelore Druids are going to Vastyr to defend the city. The seed should be safe there."
"204987124-0-74557";"Who are you hunting?"
"204987124-0-74559";"What did you mean, when three circles become one?"
"204987124-0-74560";"You said the Druid King created this place?"
"204987124-0-74562";"What will Archdruid Orlaith do with Sir Stefan?"
"204987124-0-74563";"What happens when the leaders learn about Lord Bacaro's betrayal?"
"204987124-0-74564";"Archdruid Orlaith wants House Mornard to stay out of her way while she claims the sacred seeds."
"204987124-0-74565";"Are the regalia some sort of magic relics?"
"204987124-0-74567";"What about the druids?"
"204987124-0-74569";"The Dream of Kasorayn."
"204987124-0-74571";"Why was Frii so interested in the cave?"
"204987124-0-74572";"I'll see you there, Mel."
"204987124-0-74573";"What's your real opinion about Veshin?"
"204987124-0-74574";"How long before you're ready to lead the druids to Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74576";"Take care of yourself, Quen."
"204987124-0-74583";"What about the Firesong and Dreadsails surrounding Glimmertarn?"
"204987124-0-74586";"What else can you tell me about Clohaigh?"
"204987124-0-74587";"Tell me more about the jobs Juline Courcelles offers."
"204987124-0-74589";"What brings you to Galen?"
"204987124-0-74590";"What sort of conference are you holding on High Isle?"
"204987124-0-74591";"What about the peace talks on High Isle?"
"204987124-0-74593";"So early? How many surveys have you completed?"
"204987124-0-74594";"You said House Mornard hired you?"
"204987124-0-74595";"So you get to choose the new Druid King?"
"204987124-0-74596";"You said the Druid King created this place?"
"204987124-0-74598";"There's a powerful guardian on Y'ffelon. Frii believes they can turn it against the Firesong."
"204987124-0-74599";"Has House Mornard always ruled Galen?"
"204987124-0-74606";"You said the bird can't die?"
"204987124-0-74614";"Actually, I broke Commodore Malfairre's hold on the souls of Ghost Haven Bay."
"204987124-0-74616";"Why are the alliance leaders at Gonfalon Palace?"
"204987124-0-74624";"Tell me about Mount Firesong."
"204987124-0-74625";"Why is Archdruid Orlaith doing all this?"
"204987124-0-74628";"So you're not coming to Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74629";"I remember Druid Niraya from Suncleft Grotto. Sealord Nalos wanted her to lead him to something."
"204987124-0-74630";"What can you tell me about Castle Tonnere?"
"204987124-0-74631";"What became of the coin-baron?"
"204987124-0-74632";"Where exactly did Druid Niraya hide the Eldertide seed?"
"204987124-0-74635";"What's Sealord Nalos's target, then?"
"204987124-0-74636";"Tell me about your vendetta against Sealord Nalos."
"204987124-0-74637";"You can decide that after we find this treasure."
"204987124-0-74638";"Maybe your captain was wrong about you."
"204987124-0-74639";"Galen? You think the Ascendant Order is hiding on that island?"
"204987124-0-74642";"I'll meet with Count Stefan Mornard."
"204987124-0-74643";"Have you seen an Eldertide druid captive here?"
"204987124-0-74644";"Yes. She asks for your support if the Ascendant Lord makes another attempt to disrupt the talks."
"204987124-0-74645";"Then I'll let Lady Arabelle know we can count on House Mornard."
"204987124-0-74646";"Anything else out of the ordinary going on in Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74647";"What am I going to see?"
"204987124-0-74648";"Why would the Firesong Druids try to take the Chronicle?"
"204987124-0-74649";"I overheard Sealord Nalos. He learned where the seed is hidden."
"204987124-0-74650";"Why did you hide the sacred seed here?"
"204987124-0-74651";"Do you know where they are?"
"204987124-0-74652";"Tell me about the Eldertide shrine."
"204987124-0-74653";"Have you seen any other prisoners here?"
"204987124-0-74655";"How did your crew come across the bird?"
"204987124-0-74656";"These are the same people you're trying to avenge, right?"
"204987124-0-74658";"You really hate this bird, don't you?"
"204987124-0-74659";"Tell me about the vulk'esh meat."
"204987124-0-74662";"The Firesong are trying to gather the sacred seeds from the other circles. Could this be related?"
"204987124-0-74663";"I'm surprised they left any Dreadsails behind. I assumed they'd all be part of the armada."
"204987124-0-74664";"What do you need to defend the spirit from?"
"204987124-0-74665";"He's doing a demonstration down the street right now."
"204987124-0-74669";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-74670";"What happens to you after that, Frii?"
"204987124-0-74672";"I'll do as you ask, Frii."
"204987124-0-74673";"Tell me about the volcanic reaper peppers."
"204987124-0-74674";"Tell me about the vulk'esh meat."
"204987124-0-74675";"Tell me about the vulk'esh meat."
"204987124-0-74676";"So you're a famous chef?"
"204987124-0-74677";"And that's what drew you to Galen?"
"204987124-0-74678";"What can you tell me about the ingredients you need me to find?"
"204987124-0-74679";"But will we ever see Frii again?"
"204987124-0-74680";"Yes. Frii chose to stay behind and contain the volcano."
"204987124-0-74683";"So you don't believe in the legacy of the Bretons?"
"204987124-0-74685";"How will you do that?"
"204987124-0-74688";"A higher ambition?"
"204987124-0-74689";"So what about the rest of the Gilded Blades?"
"204987124-0-74690";"Why is Sealord Nalos defying his king?"
"204987124-0-74691";"Where are the rest of the Gilded Blades?"
"204987124-0-74692";"What does Sealord Nalos want with Vastyr?"
"204987124-0-74696";"What's Y'ffre's rain?"
"204987124-0-74699";"Will that release the druids from the motes and revert the wraiths back to normal?"
"204987124-0-74701";"All right. I'll pour Y'ffre's rain on the roots."
"204987124-0-74702";"So you're going to try making this dish again?"
"204987124-0-74703";"What are you going to do next?"
"204987124-0-74704";"Right. We found out they were working with the druids of the Firesong Circle."
"204987124-0-74705";"What will you do while I'm looking for Sir Stefan?"
"204987124-0-74706";"Remind me about the Draoife."
"204987124-0-74707";"Can you remind me what's going on here?"
"204987124-0-74708";"Just a friend?"
"204987124-0-74709";"Why does Frii need your protection?"
"204987124-0-74710";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-74711";"Do you think Frii is part of the prophecy?"
"204987124-0-74712";"You seem close to Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-74713";"Is this your first time threatening someone?"
"204987124-0-74718";"What do you mean professional?"
"204987124-0-74720";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-74722";"I'll talk to the archdruids and find Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-74723";"Why do you keep calling me an outsider?"
"204987124-0-74725";"What speaks to you most?"
"204987124-0-74726";"Are the Eldertide Druids here going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-74727";"Are you going to be all right, Umindior?"
"204987124-0-74729";"Take care of yourself Quen."
"204987124-0-74732";"What happened recently?"
"204987124-0-74733";"Should we leave Frii here while we look for the seeds?"
"204987124-0-74734";"Just that you don't need to worry about him."
"204987124-0-74735";"Did anyone else die?"
"204987124-0-74736";"What was Jocien like when he was alive?"
"204987124-0-74737";"What were you writing, Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-74739";"You mean like the Investigator Vale books?"
"204987124-0-74740";"Are you still planning to get revenge for your captain and crew?"
"204987124-0-74741";"How did all this get started?"
"204987124-0-74742";"Is Vastyr safe now?"
"204987124-0-74743";"What are your plans for the Gloomlantern?"
"204987124-0-74744";"What are your plans for the Gloomlantern?"
"204987124-0-74745";"If you ask around the Systres for an Ilyes Maul, I know he's looking for a first mate."
"204987124-0-74746";"Remind me. What happened in the cathedral?"
"204987124-0-74749";"I helped Druid Laurel light the beacon and stopped the Firesong from finding Frii."
"204987124-0-74752";"The Three Banners War?"
"204987124-0-74753";"Ranser's War ended almost two decades ago."
"204987124-0-74754";"Why can't you travel to Vastyr and see your wife yourself? Are you trapped here?"
"204987124-0-74755";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-74756";"So you haven't tried to leave this beach?"
"204987124-0-74757";"You can talk to squirrels?"
"204987124-0-74758";"What happened last time?"
"204987124-0-74759";"So who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-74760";"So then why don't you just leave him."
"204987124-0-74761";"What can you tell me about Ivyhame?"
"204987124-0-74762";"How did you figure out he could lead you to treasure?"
"204987124-0-74763";"Who are the deep druids you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-74764";"You said you have a choice. Can Archdruid Orlaith make you regrow the seeds?"
"204987124-0-74765";"You said the bird can't die?"
"204987124-0-74766";"Have you always been able to sense the sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-74770";"And then we'll get another riddle?"
"204987124-0-74774";"If the door can't be opened, how could Archdruid Orlaith be inside?"
"204987124-0-74775";"Tell me about these druid tunnels."
"204987124-0-74777";"As you command, Druid King."
"204987124-0-74778";"What's the Allwither?"
"204987124-0-74779";"How will you return the regalia to Y'ffre?"
"204987124-0-74780";"Now?"
"204987124-0-74783";"What's next for you, Mel?"
"204987124-0-74786";"Why did those druids turn against Druid King Kasorayn?"
"204987124-0-74787";"Why did you chose the Stonelore Circle?"
"204987124-0-74788";"Where is he now?"
"204987124-0-74789";"And where is she hiding?"
"204987124-0-74790";"Do you know where he is?"
"204987124-0-74791";"Why did Druid Madena want to study the Fauns?"
"204987124-0-74792";"Why do you have Mohair with you?"
"204987124-0-74793";"Good. I'll see you on All Flags Islet."
"204987124-0-74794";"You promised payment as well."
"204987124-0-74797";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-74799";"I'll go find Frii in the Vine District and see if they're willing to go along with this."
"204987124-0-74800";"I take it Unu is special to you?"
"204987124-0-74801";"Why do you think they wanted to take Unu?"
"204987124-0-74802";"How will you keep him safe?"
"204987124-0-74803";"How did Archdruid Orlaith get the sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-74805";"I'll leave you two alone, then."
"204987124-0-74806";"What if Frii refuses to go along with this plan?"
"204987124-0-74807";"What does Archdruid Orlaith need Druid Laurel for?"
"204987124-0-74808";"So … you're a druid that plays Tribute?"
"204987124-0-74810";"Do you want to play, then?"
"204987124-0-74812";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-74813";"Where will you go next?"
"204987124-0-74816";"Your head hurts and your stomach is growling, when was the last time you took care of yourself?"
"204987124-0-74817";"Could the Ascendant Order really stop the peace talks now?"
"204987124-0-74819";"I'll talk to the alliance leaders and Lord Bacaro."
"204987124-0-74820";"Would the alliance leaders really abandon the peace talks now?"
"204987124-0-74821";"Tell me about Urdiir the Guardian."
"204987124-0-74823";"So you consider it a mercy?"
"204987124-0-74824";"Why are the druids helping the city?"
"204987124-0-74825";"Sounds like you could be talking about your druidic circles."
"204987124-0-74826";"What about Druid Laurel and Frii? Have you seen them recently?"
"204987124-0-74827";"What about Frii?"
"204987124-0-74828";"Right. See you later."
"204987124-0-74829";"Is that why you've brought a bodyguard?"
"204987124-0-74831";"Do you think you'll move on now that you know he's passed?"
"204987124-0-74833";"You said you're tracking one specific vampire?"
"204987124-0-74834";"It sounds as if this hunt is personal."
"204987124-0-74835";"Sorry, who are you?"
"204987124-0-74836";"I spoke with Jocien's spirit, that's how I knew to bring you the ring."
"204987124-0-74838";"How do I get to the temple?"
"204987124-0-74841";"Sir Stefan wants you to stick around. We could still use your help."
"204987124-0-74843";"You were a spy even as a kid?"
"204987124-0-74844";"Why am I going back out into the city?"
"204987124-0-74845";"Right. I'll see you in the suite."
"204987124-0-74846";"I spoke with Jocien's spirit. I found his ghost while traveling the southwest coast."
"204987124-0-74847";"Here, take it. It's yours now."
"204987124-0-74850";"So you're not in it just for the gold?"
"204987124-0-74855";"Why are the druids helping the city?"
"204987124-0-74857";"Why does Archdruid Orlaith want the sacred seeds?"
"204987124-0-74858";"Do you believe Archdruid Orlaith would carry out her threat and make blood sacrifices?"
"204987124-0-74859";"Anything else I should know about the tree?"
"204987124-0-74860";"Is there anything special about the soil in this pouch?"
"204987124-0-74862";"Remind me what's going on here."
"204987124-0-74863";"You don't think Frii will talk to you?"
"204987124-0-74869";"Thank you, Frii. Sir Stefan and I will find you on Y'ffelon."
"204987124-0-74872";"You seem to know me, but I don't believe we've met."
"204987124-0-74874";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-74875";"Those are all good places to start."
"204987124-0-74876";"What's going to happen to Frii?"
"204987124-0-74877";"Will other Sea Elves respect your truce with Galen?"
"204987124-0-74878";"Will the Druid King's gauntlet be safe with you, Lord Bacaro?"
"204987124-0-74880";"Why am I going back out into the city?"
"204987124-0-74882";"Find the entrance to the suite up top and break in. Got it."
"204987124-0-74883";"Captain Siravaen is waiting just up the beach."
"204987124-0-74884";"I'm with you, Sir Stefan."
"204987124-0-74885";"Do you think we can trust the Firesong Circle now?"
"204987124-0-74886";"Build anew? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-74888";"You're not upset that your dish was ruined?"
"204987124-0-74889";"Tell me about your relationships with your father and Archdruid Rahval."
"204987124-0-74893";"What kind of aid?"
"204987124-0-74896";"What do you think we should do now, Sir Stefan?"
"204987124-0-74898";"Are you happy that Sealord Nalos is dead?"
"204987124-0-74901";"I'll meet you at the tavern in Vastyr."
"204987124-0-74903";"Who are the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-74904";"What did you mean by oversight of this region?"
"204987124-0-74905";"Do you have an idea of the source?"
"204987124-0-74906";"How will you resolve the distortion?"
"204987124-0-74907";"Can you tell me about this Psijic Order?"
"204987124-0-74912";"What do you mean by temporal knot?"
"204987124-0-74916";"I'm sorry to hear about that."
"204987124-0-74917";"You're tracking a specific vampire?"
"204987124-0-74924";"Are we in the same cavern?"
"204987124-0-74926";"Will you be all right?"
"204987124-0-74931";"And we've made Skryim a little bit safer."
"204987124-0-74932";"What exactly happened to you?"
"204987124-0-74934";"Do you know what collected you?"
"204987124-0-74935";"You saw something about me. Something you didn't realize."
"204987124-0-74936";"You said House Mornard hired you?"
"204987124-0-74937";"So, can I get a bottle of brandy from you, or not?"
"204987124-0-74938";"I'll convince Chef Rhazeez he owes you a private dinner."
"204987124-0-74944";"Were you writing something in that book, Lady Arabelle?"
"204987124-0-74946";"You mean like the Investigator Vale books?"
"204987124-0-74947";"Your mission?"
"204987124-0-74949";"So the Eldertide and Firesong are evil druids?"
"204987124-0-74955";"Why does House Mornard want a mineral survey of Embervine cave?"
"204987124-0-74957";"As the count of Galen, are the druids here your subjects?"
"204987124-0-74958";"You're the count. Why aren't you leading the defense of Galen?"
"204987124-0-74959";"What was that about ivy-robed beggars?"
"204987124-0-74961";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-74963";"I ran into Eldertide Druids who helped the Ascendant Magus on High Isle."
"204987124-0-74964";"Have the Dreadsails been a problem on Galen before now?"
"204987124-0-74965";"What's a banneret?"
"204987124-0-74966";"Who are you, exactly?"
"204987124-0-74967";"Have the Dreadsails been a problem on Galen before now?"
"204987124-0-74968";"What can you tell me about the Dreadsails?"
"204987124-0-74970";"What do you know about Llanshara?"
"204987124-0-74971";"Why did the Sea Elves take Llanshara?"
"204987124-0-74976";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-74977";"What do you know about the druid crystals?"
"204987124-0-74979";"How should I distract those thugs?"
"204987124-0-74982";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-74984";"What distracted your … nose?"
"204987124-0-74985";"How go the talks?"
"204987124-0-74986";"What distracted your … nose?"
"204987124-0-74987";"Can you tell me anything more about why you're here?"
"204987124-0-74989";"The note mentioned sea witches. What do you know about those?"
"204987124-0-74990";"You said she dragged you in here?"
"204987124-0-74991";"Do people usually behave like Neri towards you?"
"204987124-0-74992";"Did you learn anything else while you had Neri's attention?"
"204987124-0-74993";"Did you learn anything else while you had Neri's attention?"
"204987124-0-74994";"Any idea where to look for Umindior?"
"204987124-0-74995";"You're far from Abah's Landing. This job must be important."
"204987124-0-74999";"I'll talk to Druid Laurel."
"204987124-0-75001";"I'll get the key, then head to the druid cavern."
"204987124-0-75002";"Why would someone send you a gift of your own wine?"
"204987124-0-75003";"Will you and Laniwys be safe when we free you?"
"204987124-0-75006";"Where did you get food and wine?"
"204987124-0-75007";"Right. I noticed them talking when I arrived at the castle. The sentry ordered them to wait."
"204987124-0-75010";"How did you get this job?"
"204987124-0-75013";"You're far from Abah's Landing. Must be an important job."
"204987124-0-75015";"How long can Vastyr withstand this kind of assault?"
"204987124-0-75016";"Try this. Give me your gold or I'll tear your toes off one by one."
"204987124-0-75017";"Why do you need my jewels?"
"204987124-0-75018";"Yes. I hope it's enough to get you back on your ship."
"204987124-0-75020";"It's getting there. Now just be creative."
"204987124-0-75022";"Yes, that should do it."
"204987124-0-75023";"Yes, that should do it."
"204987124-0-75024";"Why did you ignore Sir Stefan's warnings about trouble among druid circles?"
"204987124-0-75026";"How are you after the attack at Draoife Dell?"
"204987124-0-75028";"Why is Archdruid Orlaith doing all this?"
"204987124-0-75029";"Will Mount Firesong erupt?"
"204987124-0-75032";"Druid Laurel told me the seeds are only symbols with no real power."
"204987124-0-75033";"What will the Eldertide Circle do now?"
"204987124-0-75034";"What's the significance of the Eldertide seed?"
"204987124-0-75038";"A trove? Like a treasure trove?"
"204987124-0-75040";"I'll find you in the gambling parlor, Raz."
"204987124-0-75043";"Three glyphics?"
"204987124-0-75044";"And what about this talisman."
"204987124-0-75045";"Why do I need three glyphics?"
"204987124-0-75046";"What do you think Archdruid Orlaith will do next?"
"204987124-0-75048";"I'll find Druid Laurel and Frii and tell them what happened here."
"204987124-0-75049";"Why can't we just start the peace talks?"
"204987124-0-75050";"Find the entrance to the suite up top and break in. Got it."
"204987124-0-75052";"What's the Itinerant Staff?"
"204987124-0-75053";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-0-75054";"<Enter Scrivener's Hall.>"
"204987124-0-75056";"I'll help you retrieve the Itinerant Staff and stop Valinna."
"204987124-0-75064";"Does this change the mission?"
"204987124-0-75065";"Does this change the mission?"
"204987124-0-75067";"Is the letter important?"
"204987124-0-75069";"All right, I'll take the Emerald Glyphic."
"204987124-0-75072";"You've mentioned your claws twice, what do you mean?"
"204987124-0-75073";"Claws? Are you a skineshifter too?"
"204987124-0-75074";"But, you just said your opportunity hadn't happened yet."
"204987124-0-75076";"Take care of yourself, Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-75077";"Do you really think people will stop looking for the treasure?"
"204987124-0-75079";"One of the Sodality of the Eye survived. Dralys. He recovered this letter from the mercenaries."
"204987124-0-75080";"How do I find one of Hermaeus Mora's faithful?"
"204987124-0-75081";"You're a druid that plays Tribute?"
"204987124-0-75083";"All right, I'll be back."
"204987124-0-75087";"And those two possible futures are?"
"204987124-0-75088";"Tell me about the Druid King."
"204987124-0-75089";"And what determines which of these two futures comes about?"
"204987124-0-75090";"Any idea why Lord Bacaro would take Frii to Y'ffre's Path?"
"204987124-0-75091";"This scrap of paper suggests someone else is seeking the glyphics in order to assault Apocrypha."
"204987124-0-75092";"What now, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-75093";"All right, let's go talk to Bassian."
"204987124-0-75094";"How is Lady Arabelle doing, Ryvana?"
"204987124-0-75095";"Can you tell me who usually leads you to the shrine?"
"204987124-0-75096";"So what happens now?"
"204987124-0-75099";"I was hoping Naraheida could tell me the location of the Shrine of the Golden Eye."
"204987124-0-75100";"Thanks for the information, Dralys."
"204987124-0-75103";"So you view this as a curse?"
"204987124-0-75104";"So why not curse yourself?"
"204987124-0-75105";"You mentioned a debt, is that to Yves?"
"204987124-0-75106";"Tell me more about yourself, Quen."
"204987124-0-75107";"What do you know about Llanshara?"
"204987124-0-75108";"Frii used the regalia to bind themselves to the mountain. I think it was destroyed by the volcano."
"204987124-0-75109";"How did you meet Umindior?"
"204987124-0-75110";"What did the Sea Elf say to you earlier?"
"204987124-0-75111";"What do you mean too friendly?"
"204987124-0-75112";"How did you get this job?"
"204987124-0-75113";"Let's go talk to Quen."
"204987124-0-75114";"I hope you know what you're doing, Quen."
"204987124-0-75117";"Perhaps you should learn."
"204987124-0-75118";"If you say so."
"204987124-0-75119";"Couldn't you?"
"204987124-0-75121";"You're asking me to share a meal with you?"
"204987124-0-75122";"And what does being a Breton mean to you?"
"204987124-0-75124";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-75125";"Can you really lead the druids of Galen?"
"204987124-0-75126";"You mean the Dusksabers?"
"204987124-0-75127";"I'll use the glyphics."
"204987124-0-75129";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-75131";"All right, let's go find Naraheida."
"204987124-0-75135";"I'll go talk to Druid Ryvana."
"204987124-0-75139";"So, you want to make me smaller or larger?"
"204987124-0-75144";"Make me larger."
"204987124-0-75149";"What did Frii ask you to do?"
"204987124-0-75150";"I'll meet you at the overlook north of Glimmertarn, Laurel."
"204987124-0-75154";"You marked the Windhelm docks on my map. Why Eastmarch? Why not leave directly from here?"
"204987124-0-75155";"Where are we headed exactly?"
"204987124-0-75156";"Where are we headed exactly?"
"204987124-0-75157";"Where are we headed exactly?"
"204987124-0-75158";"Have you done any more jobs since Llanshara?"
"204987124-0-75159";"Any objections if I steal more than just the <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-75162";"Never mind. I'll ask someone else."
"204987124-0-75170";"That's up to you. He did give me the brandy."
"204987124-0-75171";"You're not upset that your dish was ruined?"
"204987124-0-75172";"The Firesong woke you?"
"204987124-0-75173";"The glyphic's counterparts?"
"204987124-0-75175";"Anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-75176";"So you're not a Daedric cultist?"
"204987124-0-75179";"It said it was defending the path."
"204987124-0-75181";"Will Gwenaelle be all right?"
"204987124-0-75183";"Frii has a plan. Let's go."
"204987124-0-75185";"What about you and Druid Laurel?"
"204987124-0-75186";"And have you reached a conclusion?"
"204987124-0-75187";"And your wife wasn't among the dead Eldertide we found?"
"204987124-0-75194";"Is there anything else I can help you with, Laurel?"
"204987124-0-75197";"Where can I find the people you asked me to invite?"
"204987124-0-75204";"You think you can do that without the Chronicle?"
"204987124-0-75208";"Did you visit the Shrine of Saint Vorys?"
"204987124-0-75209";"Did you visit the Shrine of Saint Vorys nearby?"
"204987124-0-75210";"Have you seen any strange activity around your camp?"
"204987124-0-75211";"How have you handled the Khajiit camp?"
"204987124-0-75212";"Who are you, and how did you get involved in all this?"
"204987124-0-75213";"She wanted me to search for anything suspicious and assure you she has everything under control."
"204987124-0-75214";"Have you had any visitors that weren't Dark Elves?"
"204987124-0-75215";"No, I don't have a message for you."
"204987124-0-75216";"Won't he get attacked by the spirits?"
"204987124-0-75217";"Are you familiar with the mine's overseer?"
"204987124-0-75221";"And what is the Consortium?"
"204987124-0-75224";"I haven't seen Naryu since Balmora."
"204987124-0-75225";"What are the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-75226";"So you only kill your target?"
"204987124-0-75227";"What caused the change in the Remnants?"
"204987124-0-75228";"How did the Dremnaken get in?"
"204987124-0-75229";"Who are the Remnant?"
"204987124-0-75230";"Why would they make all this effort and then get scared away?"
"204987124-0-75231";"So, this is legal?"
"204987124-0-75233";"You mean you don't know why the Painted Eye are here?"
"204987124-0-75234";"Nilphas Drethan let the Painted Eye in?"
"204987124-0-75237";"The Lark saw through your trick. He left this note for you at the shrine."
"204987124-0-75238";"I'll head back to the Baandari camp. What do you want me to do there?"
"204987124-0-75239";"You don't get paid unless you rescue them, do you?"
"204987124-0-75241";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-75242";"You're fixed now?"
"204987124-0-75243";"If we find the Mnemonic Fragments, you'll be able to reconnect to the laboratory?"
"204987124-0-75244";"What are Mnemonic Fragments?"
"204987124-0-75245";"My agreement?"
"204987124-0-75247";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-75249";"But how can I save reality? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-75250";"What do I need to do at these three locations?"
"204987124-0-75253";"You know where and when, but not what I need to do?"
"204987124-0-75254";"So this is related to the Emerald Glyphic I recovered for Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-75255";"What's Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-75256";"So you serve Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-75257";"And what exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-75258";"Then how do you know that there's a threat against Apocrypha and Nirn?"
"204987124-0-75259";"Tell me more about Apocrypha and its connection to Nirn."
"204987124-0-75260";"Tell me about Necrom Necropolis."
"204987124-0-75261";"Tell me about Tel Rendys."
"204987124-0-75262";"Tell me about Necrom Necropolis."
"204987124-0-75263";"Tell me about Necrom Necropolis."
"204987124-0-75264";"Tell me about the portals."
"204987124-0-75265";"What if she tells the high priest the truth about the replica herself?"
"204987124-0-75266";"Why is that a good thing for you?"
"204987124-0-75267";"Are you turning yourself in?"
"204987124-0-75268";"The Necropolis has been closed because the monks there have fallen ill."
"204987124-0-75270";"You don't want to be remembered as the port master who let a plague overrun Necrom, do you?"
"204987124-0-75271";"Has anyone else seen any change in the talisman?"
"204987124-0-75272";"How did you manage to make such a convincing replica of the talisman?"
"204987124-0-75273";"I have some questions about the Eye of Baan Dar."
"204987124-0-75277";"He went home. He's really sick. Now about the Stormwing …."
"204987124-0-75278";"Wait, did you say cultists?"
"204987124-0-75279";"Are there any other survivors?"
"204987124-0-75280";"What about the Argonian soldiers?"
"204987124-0-75281";"You said she usurped power from you."
"204987124-0-75282";"Valinna doesn't know about this entrance?"
"204987124-0-75283";"When did all this happen?"
"204987124-0-75284";"Recording … all things?"
"204987124-0-75285";"Do all scribes get a Watcher?"
"204987124-0-75286";"Why did you ask them not to mention your involvement?"
"204987124-0-75289";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-75291";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-75292";"Why did you start your traveling creature show?"
"204987124-0-75296";"Where are these keys?"
"204987124-0-75299";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-75300";"What will the Remnant do about the Apogee?"
"204987124-0-75301";"What was the shrine for?"
"204987124-0-75302";"The note doesn't say, but it does indicate they want to search the Necropolis for something."
"204987124-0-75303";"You must know another way to get into the Necropolis."
"204987124-0-75304";"The Consortium will try to reopen it. Do you trust them to do it safely without your oversight?"
"204987124-0-75307";"Here. Take the queen's gland and set your demands. Cindieth will make the Consortium see reason."
"204987124-0-75308";"This must mean your power is your own. You should rebuild the Remnants."
"204987124-0-75309";"How will the Remnants take the news about the clan disbanding?"
"204987124-0-75310";"How do you feel about rebuilding?"
"204987124-0-75311";"And what about the feud between House Dufort and House Mornard?"
"204987124-0-75312";"Take care of yourself, Razum-dar."
"204987124-0-75313";"If the Camonna Tong is keeping the soldiers hostage, why does your writ focus on one Dark Elf?"
"204987124-0-75314";"How does this threaten the Ebonheart Pact?"
"204987124-0-75316";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-75317";"Who are the Scribes of Mora?"
"204987124-0-75318";"You still want to be the overseer of the mine?"
"204987124-0-75319";"How do you help each other?"
"204987124-0-75320";"You made maps, what other things do the Scribes record?"
"204987124-0-75321";"You can't force the rifts to open?"
"204987124-0-75322";"Do you think Cindieth will be able to keep her promise to help you?"
"204987124-0-75323";"What happens when the rifts close?"
"204987124-0-75324";"So the scribes travel through the rifts knowing they may not make it back?"
"204987124-0-75325";"Who's Valinna?"
"204987124-0-75326";"So what does the future hold for you now?"
"204987124-0-75327";"You'd rather join the Three Banners War than stay here?"
"204987124-0-75328";"Do you think Cindieth will be able to keep her promise to help you?"
"204987124-0-75329";"What will you do if you lose your job?"
"204987124-0-75333";"Both Fomesa and Gine are dead."
"204987124-0-75334";"You think the cultists are trying to poison the clutch?"
"204987124-0-75335";"You think the cultists are trying to poison the clutch?"
"204987124-0-75336";"You think the cultists are trying to poison the clutch?"
"204987124-0-75337";"You think the cultists are trying to poison the clutch?"
"204987124-0-75338";"And that's where you come in?"
"204987124-0-75339";"No."
"204987124-0-75341";"So the Camonna Tong are xenophobic."
"204987124-0-75342";"Do you know where they're keeping the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-75344";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-75345";"I'm not sure about importance, but her business was at Ald Isra."
"204987124-0-75346";"How do you know that the note's from Naryu?"
"204987124-0-75347";"Tell me more about Luaffyn Romavel."
"204987124-0-75348";"Do you know what she's working on?"
"204987124-0-75349";"Tell me more about Luaffyn Romavel."
"204987124-0-75350";"You don't know anything about what the Lark is trying to steal?"
"204987124-0-75355";"What's next for you?"
"204987124-0-75356";"Did you deliver the druid relic?"
"204987124-0-75357";"Did you deliver the druid relic?"
"204987124-0-75360";"No. I agreed to help because the threat to Hermaeus Mora also endangers Nirn."
"204987124-0-75361";"I'll get the key and head into the catacombs."
"204987124-0-75362";"Tell me more about Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-75363";"Right, the threat against Apocrypha that also endangers Nirn."
"204987124-0-75364";"What do you know about the Hidden Kindred?"
"204987124-0-75365";"I did some work for the Gleaners before."
"204987124-0-75366";"What can you tell me about the Disquiet Study?"
"204987124-0-75367";"What can you tell me about the Disquiet Study?"
"204987124-0-75368";"Eerie how?"
"204987124-0-75369";"Is it difficult staying in touch over such long distances?"
"204987124-0-75370";"And you think we'll be able to find your family's favorite books inside?"
"204987124-0-75371";"What are you doing in Apocrypha, Ysgild?"
"204987124-0-75372";"Do you think we'll ever see Frii again?"
"204987124-0-75373";"What's next for the druids of the archipelago?"
"204987124-0-75374";"Do you think we'll ever see Frii again?"
"204987124-0-75375";"Do you think we'll ever see Frii again?"
"204987124-0-75376";"I … thank you."
"204987124-0-75378";"All right, I'll go speak to Lady Arabelle."
"204987124-0-75379";"A trap? Is that why Meenai-Shai died?"
"204987124-0-75381";"Is there a way to free you?"
"204987124-0-75382";"Do you think you'll ever reconcile your dual heritages?"
"204987124-0-75383";"What should I do with this piece of the relic?"
"204987124-0-75384";"Was there anything else, Abbot Ilvel?"
"204987124-0-75385";"How do we do that, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-75386";"How did the mineral survey of Embervine go?"
"204987124-0-75387";"I'll go with you to Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-75389";"And are you certain this book is actually your brother?"
"204987124-0-75390";"What are you doing in Apocrypha, Ysgild?"
"204987124-0-75391";"The Keepers of the Dead?"
"204987124-0-75392";"Will House Mornard take on a bigger role in the governing of the Systres?"
"204987124-0-75393";"Do you think you'll ever reconcile your dual heritages?"
"204987124-0-75394";"Do you think you'll ever reconcile your dual heritages?"
"204987124-0-75395";"Will you look for another mystery to solve?"
"204987124-0-75396";"Do you think these talks will end the Three Banners War?"
"204987124-0-75397";"Do you think these talks will end the Three Banners War?"
"204987124-0-75398";"What would we need to do?"
"204987124-0-75400";"I'll enter the study with you and Vorm."
"204987124-0-75402";"What kinds of secrets?"
"204987124-0-75403";"What can you tell me about your family's favorite books?"
"204987124-0-75406";"Tell me about your favorite, Ysgild."
"204987124-0-75407";"Tell me about Vorm's favorite books."
"204987124-0-75408";"Tell me about your favorite, Ysgild."
"204987124-0-75409";"Tell me about your favorite, Ysgild."
"204987124-0-75410";"Meln the Mouthless?"
"204987124-0-75411";"Hermaeus Mora sent us to investigate this place."
"204987124-0-75413";"What kind of help do you need?"
"204987124-0-75416";"Will you not accept his decision?"
"204987124-0-75417";"Shouting?"
"204987124-0-75424";"Apparently, outside forces cannot affect the Chorus."
"204987124-0-75425";"What does this entity do?"
"204987124-0-75426";"Arcanovores?"
"204987124-0-75427";"A strange lens? What does it do?"
"204987124-0-75429";"I'll see if we can figure out how to dispel the ward."
"204987124-0-75431";"An auxiliary what?"
"204987124-0-75432";"I'm not sure what any of this actually means or how it helps us."
"204987124-0-75433";"What's the Infinite Panopticon?"
"204987124-0-75434";"So how do we use this information, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-75436";"I'll watch out for Curate Gadayn, but are you certain this will work?"
"204987124-0-75438";"How long do minds stay in the Chorus?"
"204987124-0-75439";"What is the Esoterica Corporea?"
"204987124-0-75440";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-75441";"All right. I'll meet you at the spot on my map."
"204987124-0-75443";"Are you sure he can be found in this place?"
"204987124-0-75445";"One of us?"
"204987124-0-75446";"What is that?"
"204987124-0-75447";"What can I expect inside the Chorus?"
"204987124-0-75450";"All right, I'll enter the Chorus and look for the rogue mind."
"204987124-0-75452";"What should we expect once we enter the Infinite Panopticon?"
"204987124-0-75453";"If you were dead, what stopped her from stealing this possession of yours?"
"204987124-0-75454";"All right, let's enter the Infinite Panopticon."
"204987124-0-75457";"What are you asking, Meln?"
"204987124-0-75458";"Catches?"
"204987124-0-75459";"You didn't ask for more details?"
"204987124-0-75460";"And they can learn that in the Panopticon?"
"204987124-0-75463";"My business with Reynila is personal."
"204987124-0-75464";"I'll deliver these flowers and then meet you at the tavern."
"204987124-0-75465";"Where can I find Deredrien?"
"204987124-0-75469";"Actually, this is from Harn Orenvi."
"204987124-0-75470";"Is the Reformer the one who hired you to find Reynila, then?"
"204987124-0-75471";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-75473";"All right. I'll meet you at Reynila's campsite."
"204987124-0-75474";"Did you try to find out information on where you might have come from?"
"204987124-0-75475";"Have you spent a lot of time in Sadrith Mora?"
"204987124-0-75476";"What do you want?"
"204987124-0-75477";"You sure there is someone who can get us what Federo wants at the Adept's Retreat?"
"204987124-0-75478";"You aren't coming?"
"204987124-0-75479";"Do you know where they're keeping the soldiers?"
"204987124-0-75480";"Who even are the Morag Tong?"
"204987124-0-75481";"If you're one of the Morag Tong, why do you need my help?"
"204987124-0-75482";"How do you know I'm not working with the Lark?"
"204987124-0-75483";"Is there another option?"
"204987124-0-75485";"Agreed. Particularly with a Daedric Prince like Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-75488";"What can you tell me about the history of this shrine?"
"204987124-0-75489";"Master Shelreni took a gem from Tel Rendys. I need it back."
"204987124-0-75490";"How does one become an archivist for Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-75491";"How did you end up becoming a book?"
"204987124-0-75492";"Do you plan on returning to your post in the Disquiet Study?"
"204987124-0-75493";"So you turned yourself into a book to escape?"
"204987124-0-75494";"How did you know gathering these books would save you?"
"204987124-0-75495";"Tell me about yourself, Vorm."
"204987124-0-75496";"Do you think Vorm is going to like traveling with you?"
"204987124-0-75499";"Good luck on your travels, Ysgild."
"204987124-0-75501";"Where can I find Deredrien?"
"204987124-0-75502";"Thanks for the information. I'll seek out Deredrien."
"204987124-0-75503";"So how do we follow them?"
"204987124-0-75505";"Are the Hushed lost forever?"
"204987124-0-75506";"What do ciphers do in Quires Wind?"
"204987124-0-75507";"Black Books?"
"204987124-0-75508";"So who or what is the First Servant?"
"204987124-0-75509";"The ultimate honor?"
"204987124-0-75510";"But Hermaeus Mora changed his offer."
"204987124-0-75511";"You would be making a deal with a Daedric Prince."
"204987124-0-75515";"You were drowning."
"204987124-0-75521";"You should take the book. Complete your bargain."
"204987124-0-75523";"I will entrust this to you."
"204987124-0-75526";"You'd be punished for misplacing a few books?"
"204987124-0-75528";"You think Prelate Faram is responsible?"
"204987124-0-75530";"You said you were away when the other keepers got sick?"
"204987124-0-75531";"Tell me more about the Necropolis."
"204987124-0-75541";"Where is the Black Book?"
"204987124-0-75542";"What does Master Shelreni need the book for?"
"204987124-0-75544";"The flowers are some kind of message, aren't they?"
"204987124-0-75546";"Fine, I'll deliver your floral message."
"204987124-0-75549";"Then tell me more about this knowledge you seek."
"204987124-0-75551";"And where's Blightcrown? Why are you working with Peryite's priest?"
"204987124-0-75553";"You said this memory changed?"
"204987124-0-75554";"And this will cause reality to unravel?"
"204987124-0-75556";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-75557";"I can handle myself in a fight. Let's go."
"204987124-0-75558";"And you really don't know what you were hired to take back from Reynila?"
"204987124-0-75559";"Where is Reynila now? We have reason to believe she's in danger."
"204987124-0-75560";"Who is Reynila to you?"
"204987124-0-75561";"Well, I'm here. Are you ready to find Reynila?"
"204987124-0-75562";"Then why is the Reformer after you, too?"
"204987124-0-75564";"Is it true she used to work for the Reformer?"
"204987124-0-75565";"Let's get going and find Reynila."
"204987124-0-75567";"I'm ready to chase down the Lark of Rosgard. Let's go."
"204987124-0-75571";"Let's head to Reynila's campsite, then."
"204987124-0-75572";"You aren't curious about who you were before? Someone could be looking for you."
"204987124-0-75576";"The elder, Eilirsu-dro, visited the shrine alone. I also found this story he wrote."
"204987124-0-75577";"How did you get captured?"
"204987124-0-75578";"Did you know Ashur was coming?"
"204987124-0-75580";"Why would he do that?"
"204987124-0-75581";"Why would you agree to steal something without getting paid for it?"
"204987124-0-75582";"Why does Valinna want the Itinerant Staff so badly?"
"204987124-0-75584";"I have some questions first."
"204987124-0-75589";"If she's so loyal to you, why did Valinna keep her around?"
"204987124-0-75590";"Why did you hide the Itinerant Staff in the Deadlands?"
"204987124-0-75591";"How did you end up here?"
"204987124-0-75592";"A younger body?"
"204987124-0-75594";"Wait—"
"204987124-0-75595";"You did not."
"204987124-0-75596";"What have you been doing for the scribes?"
"204987124-0-75600";"You don't feel any sympathy for the followers of Saint Vorys?"
"204987124-0-75601";"And if I choose to give Rilasi the original?"
"204987124-0-75602";"You're in Apocrypha, domain of Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-75610";"Good idea. I'll meet you in the tunnel."
"204987124-0-75612";"People worship a god of disease?"
"204987124-0-75613";"Blightcrown, as the prelate, said the Necropolis was closed by order of the abbot."
"204987124-0-75616";"Oh, no. I uh … have things to do."
"204987124-0-75619";"What can I expect at Hoarvor Pit?"
"204987124-0-75621";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-75622";"Why are these vampires trying to get the Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-75623";"So why did you come to see Naraheida?"
"204987124-0-75624";"Dralys told me this riddle: ""Where claw meets prey, beneath open air in stone shows the way."""
"204987124-0-75625";"I guess one of these will lead us to the Shrine of the Golden Eye."
"204987124-0-75626";"Dralys thinks you're the traitor. He says you plan to use the glyphics to betray his master."
"204987124-0-75627";"What do you do exactly?"
"204987124-0-75628";"Have you seen any suspicious activity around your camp?"
"204987124-0-75629";"What brought you to the Telvanni Peninsula?"
"204987124-0-75630";"Isn't there some way to find Torvesard or Blightcrown?"
"204987124-0-75631";"What happened? Where is the subject now?"
"204987124-0-75632";"Folsi gave me this letter. Said you'd pay well to get it. She was being followed and led them away."
"204987124-0-75633";"What about that corruption Blightcrown used in the Panopticon?"
"204987124-0-75634";"What about the Hidden Kindred?"
"204987124-0-75635";"What did you do to Nathyn? Does it have something to do with Delmon?"
"204987124-0-75636";"We're not leaving until we find Nathyn."
"204987124-0-75637";"Sathile is testing some sort of cure, and has notes on some toxic spore interfering with her wards."
"204987124-0-75638";"Is it possible Nathyn said something about it?"
"204987124-0-75639";"Are you sure you want to keep going?"
"204987124-0-75640";"To what purpose?"
"204987124-0-75641";"Is that important?"
"204987124-0-75643";"What's a writ of execution?"
"204987124-0-75644";"Who is Hermorah?"
"204987124-0-75645";"What kind of relic would be in Prior Durdryn's tomb?"
"204987124-0-75647";"Do you know anything about the relic, the Fulcrum Obscura?"
"204987124-0-75648";"Are there many relics in the catacombs?"
"204987124-0-75649";"That was you? Tun-Shei said that Delmon was responsible for what happened."
"204987124-0-75650";"Why don't the spores affect you?"
"204987124-0-75651";"You'd really give up your freedom? There's no guarantee you'll find a cure."
"204987124-0-75652";"What else can you tell me about Prior Durdryn and his tomb?"
"204987124-0-75653";"What else can you tell me about Prior Durdryn and his tomb?"
"204987124-0-75654";"And how does that help us locate Master Shelreni and recover Meln's Black Book?"
"204987124-0-75655";"All right, I'll meet you in Ald Isra."
"204987124-0-75658";"All right. What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-75663";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-75665";"What arch and statue?"
"204987124-0-75667";"You recognized Reynila's signal back at the campsite. Had you seen it before?"
"204987124-0-75670";"Why is this Reformer so interested in you?"
"204987124-0-75671";"You recognized Reynila's signal back at the campsite. Had you seen it before?"
"204987124-0-75673";"Why can't Nathyn escape on his own?"
"204987124-0-75676";"Do you still help Reynila with her operation?"
"204987124-0-75678";"When did Reynila lose track of Sharp, exactly?"
"204987124-0-75679";"How would he do that?"
"204987124-0-75680";"That explains why he's so desperate to capture Sharp again."
"204987124-0-75681";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-75683";"Can the Reformer be stopped?"
"204987124-0-75685";"You're Sharp's sister?"
"204987124-0-75688";"Where was Reynila planning to take you?"
"204987124-0-75690";"Are you going to help Dimik-ei?"
"204987124-0-75692";"But the Reformer is after you, too."
"204987124-0-75693";"Do you trust Mazandi?"
"204987124-0-75695";"No, but he made it clear it was important to his work."
"204987124-0-75696";"You think the miners are making excuses for lack of productivity?"
"204987124-0-75697";"Do you think something's gone wrong?"
"204987124-0-75698";"Did you mention a Kwama queen?"
"204987124-0-75699";"Ever heard a servant leave at night?"
"204987124-0-75700";"You're worried you might get fired?"
"204987124-0-75701";"Tell me more about the details of the audit."
"204987124-0-75702";"He said a servant leaves every Sundas and Middas night. The quarters smell awful the next day."
"204987124-0-75703";"You mentioned a fated glyphic. What's that?"
"204987124-0-75704";"Is everyone's fate etched into a glyphic?"
"204987124-0-75705";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-75706";"Couldn't you have told Dacia the truth about Nathyn's condition?"
"204987124-0-75708";"I met Master Shelreni at Tel Rendys. She has one of Hermaeus Mora's Black Books."
"204987124-0-75709";"I would stay with the one I love and wait for a cure."
"204987124-0-75718";"I have the prism."
"204987124-0-75722";"This letter indicates Tredecim was worried. They want to shift blame to Master Sulis."
"204987124-0-75724";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-75725";"What about Dimik-ei?"
"204987124-0-75726";"Have you spent a lot of time in Sadrith Mora?"
"204987124-0-75731";"Do you really think that Mevei blames you for Reynila's death?"
"204987124-0-75734";"If you say so. Let's get going, then."
"204987124-0-75735";"Are you worried you'll disappoint Federo with your selection?"
"204987124-0-75736";"If you don't like what we brought you, we'll take it back."
"204987124-0-75738";"We got you what you asked for. Where's the cache buried?"
"204987124-0-75739";"What would you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-75740";"I'll help you with your investigation."
"204987124-0-75741";"Is there really no hope of finding it now?"
"204987124-0-75746";"Are you going to hire more researchers?"
"204987124-0-75747";"Are you going to hire on more researchers?"
"204987124-0-75748";"What others?"
"204987124-0-75750";"Cartoklepts?"
"204987124-0-75751";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-75752";"Why do they have you here?"
"204987124-0-75753";"Why do they have you here?"
"204987124-0-75754";"What's inside the vault?"
"204987124-0-75764";"How do we stop them?"
"204987124-0-75767";"And this mage's research is supposed to help with that?"
"204987124-0-75768";"Aren't the Scribes of Mora all about recording new information?"
"204987124-0-75769";"So now we go and confront Alam Gutiot?"
"204987124-0-75771";"And how will this help you gain recognition?"
"204987124-0-75772";"What's wrong with his clothes?"
"204987124-0-75774";"We'll do that. Thanks."
"204987124-0-75777";"Guitot gave the Dres details about a weapon called the Permeation Snare."
"204987124-0-75779";"I'll keep looking."
"204987124-0-75781";"Think fast, then."
"204987124-0-75782";"How restricted is this vault?"
"204987124-0-75783";"Do you work for Valinna?"
"204987124-0-75784";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-75785";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-75788";"The next one wasn't signed, but I think it's from Reynila."
"204987124-0-75790";"The last note must be from the Reformer. He's signed it with his real name."
"204987124-0-75791";"Take a moment. You've been through a lot."
"204987124-0-75794";"Why does it matter that we're not attuned?"
"204987124-0-75796";"Yes. But he also wrote about ""perfecting"" the tyranite calx attunement sometime after your escape."
"204987124-0-75804";"So what are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-75805";"Why bury the cache of information on the Reformer?"
"204987124-0-75806";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-75807";"How did you get involved with the Reformer in the first place?"
"204987124-0-75809";"What can you tell me about the island?"
"204987124-0-75810";"What are you thinking?"
"204987124-0-75811";"Where do you think he hid the prism?"
"204987124-0-75813";"Tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-75815";"Are you going to keep in touch with him?"
"204987124-0-75816";"What did it show you?"
"204987124-0-75817";"Even if it's more dangerous, I think Federo would probably like it if you stayed in touch."
"204987124-0-75818";"What do you know about the enemy that threatens Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-75820";"You said I can find Harn Orenvi in the Outlaws Refuge. Is he a thief?"
"204987124-0-75823";"Very well. Where do I need to go?"
"204987124-0-75824";"Can I look around the servants quarters?"
"204987124-0-75825";"All right. I'll do that."
"204987124-0-75827";"I can do that. Let's try out your spell."
"204987124-0-75828";"But the exact location wasn't in the lines of text that remained."
"204987124-0-75829";"What does it tell us?"
"204987124-0-75833";"What about the satchel?"
"204987124-0-75840";"What do they do with the secrets?"
"204987124-0-75841";"What are the Darkreaves?"
"204987124-0-75842";"Why would you want to hurry dying?"
"204987124-0-75844";"We're going in after him."
"204987124-0-75845";"Why did you steal the secret from Hezehk?"
"204987124-0-75846";"We still have the mirror. It can track them again."
"204987124-0-75848";"Let's go find the leader."
"204987124-0-75849";"Can your mirror locate the secret?"
"204987124-0-75851";"What do you need?"
"204987124-0-75852";"Anything else I should know?"
"204987124-0-75854";"I'll follow your directions and find the secret."
"204987124-0-75855";"What should I do with it?"
"204987124-0-75857";"I'll head to the Intake Maw."
"204987124-0-75860";"Why does the assembly think they have a spy?"
"204987124-0-75861";"How can I help with that?"
"204987124-0-75862";"You think something on the Stormwing made you sick?"
"204987124-0-75864";"What did she do with the others?"
"204987124-0-75865";"So the Probabilis controls these rules?"
"204987124-0-75866";"Where is the Clockwork Probabilis?"
"204987124-0-75867";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-75871";"Does that mean you were a slave too?"
"204987124-0-75872";"What other places?"
"204987124-0-75875";"Couldn't there be some other explanation?"
"204987124-0-75876";"Let's find Mevei in Ald Isra, then."
"204987124-0-75877";"And severing that link was why Sharp lost his memories?"
"204987124-0-75878";"Didn't you research the estate before planning to steal research?"
"204987124-0-75880";"What do you mean by ascension within House Telvanni?"
"204987124-0-75881";"You don't seem very prepared."
"204987124-0-75882";"Removing the Umber Glyphic will keep the staff from making return portals?"
"204987124-0-75883";"You're making Mazandi the new Magnastylus?"
"204987124-0-75885";"Can't you just get rid of the prism?"
"204987124-0-75886";"Is that all it takes to be the Magnastylus?"
"204987124-0-75888";"Have you thought about getting to know her?"
"204987124-0-75890";"This is the kind of thing friends are for, Sharp."
"204987124-0-75891";"I'll see every memory that Sharp sees?"
"204987124-0-75892";"What do you think we should do?"
"204987124-0-75894";"What were the stories like?"
"204987124-0-75902";"What are you planning to do with the Talisman?"
"204987124-0-75903";"You're going to remove the Umber Glyphic from the Itinerant Staff??"
"204987124-0-75904";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-75906";"I'll throw it on the count of three. One … two …."
"204987124-0-75908";"How can Zilipif help you?"
"204987124-0-75909";"Got it. I'll take care of any anomalies that may appear."
"204987124-0-75911";"You mentioned a name. Meln the Mouthless."
"204987124-0-75912";"What does it mean, that he was the mouthless?"
"204987124-0-75916";"Why didn't you stop him?"
"204987124-0-75917";"How do you know about the last time we met?"
"204987124-0-75918";"I have nothing I want to speak to you about now. I'll talk to Protus."
"204987124-0-75920";"How would you disappoint her?"
"204987124-0-75924";"How do you know about the fated glyphic?"
"204987124-0-75925";"I understand. Let's get going."
"204987124-0-75927";"The Dusksabers killed many of Hermaeus Mora's followers to attain the glyphic."
"204987124-0-75928";"A magister?"
"204987124-0-75929";"The Dusksabers. Did you hire them to seize Hermaeus Mora's Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-75930";"You charmed Ogle into sending the glyphic to be unwoven?"
"204987124-0-75931";"I'd rather you didn't."
"204987124-0-75933";"Good luck in your rise to power."
"204987124-0-75934";"Fine, I'll shut down the nemesis looms. What are they?"
"204987124-0-75936";"What will you do with the prism?"
"204987124-0-75938";"That may be a good idea."
"204987124-0-75940";"Her husband?"
"204987124-0-75942";"Now that we have the key, how to we get to Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-75943";"You don't know what it means?"
"204987124-0-75945";"Let's keep moving and see if we can find Nathyn."
"204987124-0-75947";"Who or what is Delmon?"
"204987124-0-75949";"I'm ready. Let's keep moving."
"204987124-0-75950";"He said she coaxed him back to isolation."
"204987124-0-75951";"We found your research notes. Tun-Shei said Delmon was responsible for what happened in the lab."
"204987124-0-75953";"I'm with you. Let's keep going and find Nathyn."
"204987124-0-75956";"What did Sathile afflict you with?"
"204987124-0-75961";"Are you confident you can even find a cure for Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-75962";"You keep saying you're a Mnemonic Fabrication. You're not Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-75964";"I guess you did what you had to."
"204987124-0-75965";"Torvesard worked with the Hidden Kindred to steal a relic from the Necrom Necropolis. You know him?"
"204987124-0-75967";"You keep saying you're a Mnemonic Fabrication. You're not Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-75968";"The Dusksabers. Did you send them to seize Hermaeus Mora's Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-75970";"What about the Painted Eye?"
"204987124-0-75974";"How long will that take?"
"204987124-0-75977";"We'll help find a way into the tower."
"204987124-0-75978";"What kind of proposition?"
"204987124-0-75982";"What's the story behind the talisman?"
"204987124-0-75983";"Saint Vorys stole the gem from Khajiit in Elsweyr?"
"204987124-0-75984";"So you're a mercenary?"
"204987124-0-75988";"So what's your plan?"
"204987124-0-75989";"I'll get the glyphic and meet you in the Heart of Underweave."
"204987124-0-75991";"Why would Cipher Sabinius sabotage Quires Wind?"
"204987124-0-75993";"I'll take another look around."
"204987124-0-75994";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-75995";"Are you going to tell the high priest that you made a replica without his knowledge?"
"204987124-0-75996";"I'll settle things at the servants quarters."
"204987124-0-75997";"I'll go update Master Sulis."
"204987124-0-75999";"Why would Cipher Sabinius sabotage Quires Wind?"
"204987124-0-76002";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-76003";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-76004";"If there are other mages with Warlock Vanton, why don't they deal with this?"
"204987124-0-76005";"How can I help him?"
"204987124-0-76006";"Ansuul's power can spread? Even outside the Dreamstone?"
"204987124-0-76007";"What happens to me if Vanton falls while I'm inside his mind?"
"204987124-0-76008";"Tell me about the Dreamstone."
"204987124-0-76009";"<Enter Sanity's Edge.>"
"204987124-0-76010";"If the Dreamstone is so dangerous, why don't you destroy it?"
"204987124-0-76012";"If there are other mages with Warlock Vanton, why don't they deal with this?"
"204987124-0-76013";"If there are other mages with Warlock Vanton, why don't they deal with this?"
"204987124-0-76014";"What will you do while I'm in Vanton's mind?"
"204987124-0-76015";"Why is Ansuul doing this?"
"204987124-0-76016";"Ansuul's power can spread? Even outside the Dreamstone?"
"204987124-0-76018";"Or maybe the talisman doesn't hold any secret power at all."
"204987124-0-76020";"I'll go give Master Sulis an update."
"204987124-0-76021";"Will you hold on to the Eye for now, or do you plan to pass it to another?"
"204987124-0-76026";"Hopefully we can stop her before she gets the chance."
"204987124-0-76027";"So you're ready to kill him?"
"204987124-0-76028";"Will incorporating the fragments into your body remove the stored memories?"
"204987124-0-76030";"Where did you get a piece of tyranite calx?"
"204987124-0-76032";"You're going to rebuild your relationship with Dimik-ei?"
"204987124-0-76034";"All right. What's next for us?"
"204987124-0-76035";"Question"
"204987124-0-76039";"Then let's go tell Mevei and Federo what we've learned."
"204987124-0-76043";"Are you sure this is safe?"
"204987124-0-76047";"Any thoughts on helping Mevei and Federo?"
"204987124-0-76051";"I'll see what we can do."
"204987124-0-76053";"Affirm"
"204987124-0-76054";"What could he or the Painted Eye do with the Clockwork Probabilis if they had it?"
"204987124-0-76055";"I want to know about the Mnemonic Fragments."
"204987124-0-76056";"What about the prism?"
"204987124-0-76057";"How restricted is this vault?"
"204987124-0-76058";"Don't the Scribes of Mora prioritize sharing information?"
"204987124-0-76059";"So, you don't work for Valinna?"
"204987124-0-76060";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-76062";"Can you tell me more about the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-76064";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-76067";"Are you able to reproduce Dreynis's results?"
"204987124-0-76068";"What does it do?"
"204987124-0-76073";"What did she say when she dismissed you?"
"204987124-0-76074";"And Sathile hired you on?"
"204987124-0-76075";"Nathyn was playing it for you?"
"204987124-0-76076";"Who admitted them first?"
"204987124-0-76077";"What happened after that?"
"204987124-0-76079";"Where should I start looking?"
"204987124-0-76080";"Anything else you want to tell me?"
"204987124-0-76081";"The proper statute?"
"204987124-0-76083";"All right, let's go to Ald Isra."
"204987124-0-76087";"I'll head inside."
"204987124-0-76089";"There must be some way to get inside."
"204987124-0-76090";"Meln is a magister. Maybe he can help us get past the ward."
"204987124-0-76096";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-76097";"What danger are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-76103";"Apocrypha is one of the Daedric Realms, right?"
"204987124-0-76104";"Tell me more about the Ordinators."
"204987124-0-76105";"If these kwama eggs are so important, why don't you investigate this crisis?"
"204987124-0-76106";"How will I identify the merchandise?"
"204987124-0-76107";"What else can you tell me about Quires Wind?"
"204987124-0-76108";"Why would this scribe give these books to Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-76109";"If they're so dangerous, how am I supposed to get the teeth?"
"204987124-0-76110";"You've not been there?"
"204987124-0-76111";"Have you explored Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76112";"What sort of tasks do you offer?"
"204987124-0-76113";"Who are the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-76115";"Who are the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-76118";"Who are the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-76119";"Who are the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-76120";"Are these books dangerous?"
"204987124-0-76121";"Who are the Ordinators?"
"204987124-0-76122";"Tell me about the Ordinators."
"204987124-0-76124";"I saw Naryu recently."
"204987124-0-76125";"I haven't seen Naryu since Balmora."
"204987124-0-76126";"What's the story with you and Rilasi?"
"204987124-0-76127";"Has she ever come close to catching you?"
"204987124-0-76128";"Why is she so focused on keeping you two from being together?"
"204987124-0-76131";"What if I get there and the Khajiit are gone?"
"204987124-0-76132";"What about the researchers? Will they try to stop us?"
"204987124-0-76133";"Tell me about Luaffyn Romavel."
"204987124-0-76134";"Are you going to tell the high priest about the talisman?"
"204987124-0-76135";"What is Camonnaruhn?"
"204987124-0-76136";"Where can I find your missing components?"
"204987124-0-76137";"Subjects?"
"204987124-0-76139";"Has Mistress Dreloth tested any of these cures on Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-76141";"And here she writes about the work they did to restore a Vaermina statue."
"204987124-0-76142";"We'll find her."
"204987124-0-76143";"In the Panopticon, Torvesard altered Mora's memory by restoring a Vaermina statue."
"204987124-0-76144";"So you're not worried about finding the original talisman?"
"204987124-0-76145";"I'll make sure the rest of the Baandari escape safely."
"204987124-0-76146";"I'll follow Shadeya and see what I can do."
"204987124-0-76150";"Why do you think this region needs to be watched?"
"204987124-0-76152";"Why do we need to go to your sanctum?"
"204987124-0-76153";"You want to modify the Fateweaver Key with this spool?"
"204987124-0-76154";"All right, how do we make this bobbin?"
"204987124-0-76156";"Grab the stencil and imbue it with magicka. Got it."
"204987124-0-76159";"What happened to change that?"
"204987124-0-76160";"Can you tell me more about the Remnants?"
"204987124-0-76163";"And you think convincing Ulfengar and the others to stay will help?"
"204987124-0-76164";"Just like last time, right?"
"204987124-0-76166";"They were poisoning the eggs. Do you think the Consortium's alchemists can clear out the corruption?"
"204987124-0-76167";"Why do we need to inspect the kwama pen?"
"204987124-0-76168";"Why is that embarrassing?"
"204987124-0-76169";"What will finding the overseer do for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76170";"Why do we need to inspect the kwama pen?"
"204987124-0-76171";"Why do we need to inspect the kwama pen?"
"204987124-0-76174";"Why don't the Telvanni masters attend their own assembly?"
"204987124-0-76177";"You don't want to see them?"
"204987124-0-76181";"What do I do after I locate Master Shelreni?"
"204987124-0-76186";"Can you tell me more about the remaining tasks for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76187";"Can you tell me more about the remaining tasks for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76188";"Can you tell me more about the remaining tasks for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76189";"Can you tell me more about the remaining tasks for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76190";"All your researchers are dead except one. Is anyone going to hold you accountable for that?"
"204987124-0-76191";"It seems like their deaths could have been avoided if you had told Nathyn or Dacia the truth."
"204987124-0-76192";"You knew how they felt about each other?"
"204987124-0-76193";"If Dacia chooses to be inoculated, are you going to carry out experiments on her?"
"204987124-0-76194";"Can you tell me more about the remaining tasks for your audit?"
"204987124-0-76195";"You want me to help you find another job?"
"204987124-0-76197";"Which papers and where are the servants quarters?"
"204987124-0-76199";"I'll go get that insignia now."
"204987124-0-76200";"Do you let just anyone meet with Master Shelreni?"
"204987124-0-76201";"What exactly does a mouth do?"
"204987124-0-76202";"You seem less sure of yourself than the first time we confronted this thing."
"204987124-0-76207";"Does he still use it?"
"204987124-0-76208";"Who is Nilphas Drethan?"
"204987124-0-76209";"What did Sotha Sil study in his wing?"
"204987124-0-76210";"Why did Master Shelreni murder you again?"
"204987124-0-76211";"What do they want in Kemel-Ze?"
"204987124-0-76212";"You left Nilphas alone to deal with the Painted Eye?"
"204987124-0-76217";"Right, let's find those fates."
"204987124-0-76222";"All right, if you're sure you can take care of it."
"204987124-0-76229";"You mentioned something called the Hush. What is that?"
"204987124-0-76230";"How many Black Books have you written?"
"204987124-0-76231";"What is a cipher?"
"204987124-0-76240";"So we're going to unfray your fate. How are we going to do that?"
"204987124-0-76242";"You want to find Martina, but we're starting by looking for a book?"
"204987124-0-76244";"What is it you do, Azandar?"
"204987124-0-76245";"Where can we find the ritual materials?"
"204987124-0-76247";"What about the ichor?"
"204987124-0-76248";"They gave in to all of your demands?"
"204987124-0-76250";"So what happens next?"
"204987124-0-76251";"You're worried about Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76252";"How long ago did Vivec defeat Vro-Kuul-Sha?"
"204987124-0-76253";"Who was the researcher?"
"204987124-0-76254";"There is a problem with Dremora in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76255";"And that knowledge is in the tomeshells?"
"204987124-0-76256";"Why does Vivec want to learn about this power?"
"204987124-0-76257";"Is that illegal?"
"204987124-0-76258";"I'll untie you. Make a run for it."
"204987124-0-76259";"Thank me later. Just run for it when I untie you."
"204987124-0-76260";"Get out of here as soon as I get you untied."
"204987124-0-76261";"It seems there's quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76262";"It seems there is quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76263";"It seems there is quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76265";"It seems there is quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76270";"Tell me more about the Vro-Kuul-Sha the Deepreaver."
"204987124-0-76273";"You aren't scared of reentering Anchre Egg Mine?"
"204987124-0-76275";"You're not worried about working with the kwama again after your injury?"
"204987124-0-76277";"Cindieth is joining you?"
"204987124-0-76279";"What will you be doing with Ulfengar and the others?"
"204987124-0-76281";"Are you sad to be leaving Anchre Egg Mine and the peninsula?"
"204987124-0-76283";"Cipher Sabinius had instructions from someone called the First Servant."
"204987124-0-76284";"Aren't Black Books dangerous?"
"204987124-0-76288";"What do we do about the First Servant?"
"204987124-0-76289";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-76290";"Do you think he wanted to be friends?"
"204987124-0-76291";"Are you worried about a trap being set for you at Federo's place?"
"204987124-0-76292";"Do you think that's what he's done?"
"204987124-0-76293";"Then why do you think he hasn't found you yet?"
"204987124-0-76294";"Then you'll ask the Daedra about your partner?"
"204987124-0-76296";"Ready when you are."
"204987124-0-76297";"… sentences?"
"204987124-0-76298";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-76299";"In what way?"
"204987124-0-76301";"Right. To Ebonheart."
"204987124-0-76302";"Where is home, back on Tamriel?"
"204987124-0-76304";"Do you visit them much?"
"204987124-0-76307";"Right. Better get to it."
"204987124-0-76308";"Let's focus on the adversary. What do they want?"
"204987124-0-76309";"What exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-76310";"How do we learn more?"
"204987124-0-76312";"All right, let's head for Malabal Tor."
"204987124-0-76313";"I thought Daedra had to be summoned to reach Nirn."
"204987124-0-76314";"Then why would Hermaeus Mora care what happens here?"
"204987124-0-76315";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-76316";"We'll see what we can do."
"204987124-0-76318";"It seems there is quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76321";"It seems there is quite a bit of trouble around here."
"204987124-0-76323";"Who's Prince Vaermina?"
"204987124-0-76324";"Do you know what they're doing here?"
"204987124-0-76325";"Any idea who this Torvesard is?"
"204987124-0-76327";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-76328";"Why are you here?"
"204987124-0-76329";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-76330";"The ritual seemed to anger you."
"204987124-0-76331";"Powerful? How powerful?"
"204987124-0-76332";"So there's something special about Alavelis after all."
"204987124-0-76334";"What happened next?"
"204987124-0-76335";"Where's everyone now?"
"204987124-0-76336";"Why are you and Martina no longer working together?"
"204987124-0-76338";"Do you think Martina will be willing to help you?"
"204987124-0-76341";"So you didn't want to study it because it's dangerous?"
"204987124-0-76342";"Right. To the Heart of the Underweave."
"204987124-0-76344";"You mentioned contacting me by projection. What did that mean?"
"204987124-0-76345";"You mentioned these are Telvanni. What do you know of them?"
"204987124-0-76346";"Can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-76347";"Sounds good. What's our first step?"
"204987124-0-76352";"Tell me more about this book and the talisman you gave me."
"204987124-0-76355";"Why do I need to acquire the Emerald Glyphic? And what exactly is a glyphic anyway?"
"204987124-0-76357";"And who are you really, Leramil the Wise?"
"204987124-0-76360";"Let's go to the glass mine."
"204987124-0-76361";"Master Shelreni's letter to Kynreeve Ryl mentions a relic and a rite they need to find a door."
"204987124-0-76362";"Anything I should know about Rootwater Grove?"
"204987124-0-76363";"What can I expect at Hoarvor Pit?"
"204987124-0-76364";"What can I expect at Hoarvor Pit?"
"204987124-0-76365";"Let's go to the glass mine."
"204987124-0-76366";"Why do I need to acquire the Emerald Glyphic? And what exactly is a glyphic, anyway?"
"204987124-0-76369";"Good luck, Federo."
"204987124-0-76373";"What's Fathoms Drift?"
"204987124-0-76376";"Which portal should I use to reach the vault?"
"204987124-0-76383";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-0-76384";"If you're sure. Let's head to Vvardenfell and find that key."
"204987124-0-76386";"All right, I'll give the letter to Leramil. But what's that glow around the Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-76388";"Why are these vampires trying to get the Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-76389";"Tell me about this place and your order, Dralys."
"204987124-0-76390";"He knows how to use them as well."
"204987124-0-76393";"Understood. Let's head to the chamber."
"204987124-0-76394";"So the fact that the experiment created anything is exciting to you."
"204987124-0-76396";"Thanks, Azandar. So you're going to continue to look into this adversary?"
"204987124-0-76397";"Why is this so distressing for you?"
"204987124-0-76404";"And what is Fargrave, exactly?"
"204987124-0-76405";"What can you tell me about the Disquiet Study?"
"204987124-0-76407";"How do I find one of Hermaeus Mora's faithful?"
"204987124-0-76411";"How does our partnership relate to the adversary?"
"204987124-0-76412";"How does our partnership relate to the adversary?"
"204987124-0-76415";"How do I know you're not the traitor, Dralys?"
"204987124-0-76418";"Do you think Sotha Sil seeks the power of the Black Books?"
"204987124-0-76421";"All right, I'll meet you outside."
"204987124-0-76422";"Can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-76423";"So why did you lead us to this shrine, Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-76424";"How do I help save Apocrypha and Nirn?"
"204987124-0-76425";"Torvesard and the Hidden Kindred found a way to enter Apocrypha undetected."
"204987124-0-76432";"We might need help with that."
"204987124-0-76433";"What pact?"
"204987124-0-76434";"What's the importance of this spyglass?"
"204987124-0-76435";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-76436";"What must we do?"
"204987124-0-76439";"Very well. We'll do this."
"204987124-0-76440";"Meln thinks your expertise might come in handy if we do find Master Shelreni's spirit."
"204987124-0-76444";"Why would Vaermina want to enter Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76445";"You mentioned that neither you nor Scruut can feel the presence of Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-76446";"And you think this has something to do with Vaermina entering Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76447";"What did you promise?"
"204987124-0-76448";"I think it was best to leave the decision to your father."
"204987124-0-76450";"You know where her study is?"
"204987124-0-76451";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-76454";"He attacked you for touching him?"
"204987124-0-76456";"He was proud, and insisted on honoring his agreement."
"204987124-0-76457";"Do you know what you'll do now?"
"204987124-0-76458";"What's a Known Thing?"
"204987124-0-76459";"All right, I'll take Morian to the Forbidden Exhibit."
"204987124-0-76460";"What's the Keeper of the Box?"
"204987124-0-76461";"You're content to let Vaermina's betrayal go unpunished? That doesn't sound like the Telvanni way."
"204987124-0-76462";"Instead Blightcrown betrayed you and Vaermina stole your body. Do you know where she took it?"
"204987124-0-76463";"What did you do for the Princes?"
"204987124-0-76464";"Do you have something in mind, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-76465";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-76467";"Then I guess we need to return to Apocrypha."
"204987124-0-76468";"It wasn't broken by normal causes?"
"204987124-0-76469";"Odd? Is something strange?"
"204987124-0-76470";"You said it belonged to Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-76471";"Let's continue, then."
"204987124-0-76472";"Let's continue, then."
"204987124-0-76473";"You already know about the Forbidden Exhibits?"
"204987124-0-76474";"No."
"204987124-0-76475";"The final one is written to you?"
"204987124-0-76476";"Cipher Frielvi said Known Things are dangerous and that you're the only mortal who has survived one."
"204987124-0-76477";"All right, let's open the Known Thing."
"204987124-0-76479";"You certainly don't look it."
"204987124-0-76480";"Let's continue, then."
"204987124-0-76481";"I thought you said you're no longer in contact with Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-76482";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-76483";"What did you mean when you said your catches never see you coming?"
"204987124-0-76486";"Do you owe him money?"
"204987124-0-76488";"Who are you, and how did you get involved in all this?"
"204987124-0-76489";"How did you survive it?"
"204987124-0-76491";"It sounds like you and the Lark of Rosgard have history."
"204987124-0-76493";"Who is this thief, and why is he so interested in this relic?"
"204987124-0-76496";"How did you get here?"
"204987124-0-76497";"What happened to you?"
"204987124-0-76498";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-76500";"What can you tell me about the history of this shrine?"
"204987124-0-76501";"Come on, tell me about the Morag Tong."
"204987124-0-76504";"Is that Hermaeus Mora out there? What's he doing in here?"
"204987124-0-76506";"All right, let's look around."
"204987124-0-76511";"People don't visit anymore? Why not?"
"204987124-0-76512";"You mean no one has been able to figure out what the gem inside the talisman can do?"
"204987124-0-76513";"The heist is drawing in more visitors?"
"204987124-0-76514";"What will I find in there?"
"204987124-0-76516";"Isn't that dangerous?"
"204987124-0-76524";"Starlight? Fabrics of fate?"
"204987124-0-76526";"Why is it so important to return these books?"
"204987124-0-76527";"You made a deal with a Daedric Prince."
"204987124-0-76528";"Can you tell me more about the Feral Gallery?"
"204987124-0-76529";"Wait, was Cipher Frielvi in an exhibit too?"
"204987124-0-76530";"Is that why Mora set this trap?"
"204987124-0-76531";"You can't touch anything?"
"204987124-0-76533";"Have your feelings about your experiment changed?"
"204987124-0-76534";"How can we use anchors to your life against the adversary?"
"204987124-0-76535";"All right. What else?"
"204987124-0-76537";"We'll have to do some traveling to find these things."
"204987124-0-76538";"Why do we need this bloodstone?"
"204987124-0-76539";"Where can we find Nilvon and the bloodstone?"
"204987124-0-76540";"Where can we find this rubric?"
"204987124-0-76541";"Where can we find Nathriin's Commentaries?"
"204987124-0-76542";"You were Azandar's companion?"
"204987124-0-76544";"Yes, do you have one?"
"204987124-0-76549";"Why are the Sidereal Cloisters so important?"
"204987124-0-76550";"So everyone in this caravan is your family?"
"204987124-0-76551";"How long do you think you'll stay here?"
"204987124-0-76552";"Can you tell me more about the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-76553";"What is it you do here?"
"204987124-0-76555";"Where did you get the name, Tredecim?"
"204987124-0-76557";"He said he can't get past the barrier."
"204987124-0-76558";"Fair enough. So what is a rime shard?"
"204987124-0-76559";"Can we remove the barrier?"
"204987124-0-76561";"Is it safe?"
"204987124-0-76562";"There's another way into the sanctum?"
"204987124-0-76564";"Let's get to Entila's Folly, then."
"204987124-0-76570";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-76572";"So that's it? Your fate is no longer frayed?"
"204987124-0-76573";"What if I get there and the Khajiit are gone?"
"204987124-0-76574";"Are you going to tell the high priest about the story of the Eye of Baan Dar?"
"204987124-0-76576";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-76577";"That sounds difficult."
"204987124-0-76578";"What happened with the Known Thing?"
"204987124-0-76579";"You don't want to leave Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76582";"Tell me about Ald Isra."
"204987124-0-76583";"Who's chasing you?"
"204987124-0-76584";"Who's chasing you?"
"204987124-0-76586";"I'll do what I can."
"204987124-0-76587";"I rescued Meln from Master Shelreni. Without him, she can't easily decipher the Black Book."
"204987124-0-76589";"A Dremora named Torvesard plotted with Master Shelreni, Blightcrown, and Vaermina."
"204987124-0-76590";"Are you always so flirty with her?"
"204987124-0-76591";"So you're repaying him for a favor?"
"204987124-0-76593";"Why did he decide to bring the caravan all the way here for something so risky?"
"204987124-0-76594";"If you left the crypts before me, why did I reach the campsite before you?"
"204987124-0-76595";"Do you keep any of the things you steal?"
"204987124-0-76596";"Why did you agree to steal the Talisman of Saint Vorys for Eilirsu-dro?"
"204987124-0-76597";"She seemed pretty insistent that you worked alone."
"204987124-0-76601";"I'm interested in work. Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-76602";"Tell me more about the jobs Ordinator Tilena offers."
"204987124-0-76603";"Tell me more about the jobs Ordinator Nelyn offers."
"204987124-0-76604";"Tell me more about the jobs Ordinator Tilena offers."
"204987124-0-76610";"Leramil calls you the One Who Knows. How can your rivals hide from you?"
"204987124-0-76612";"How can I save Apocrypha and Nirn?"
"204987124-0-76614";"Apocrypha? Nirn? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-76615";"How does this work exactly?"
"204987124-0-76618";"Before you go, Folsi did promise me something for bringing you that letter."
"204987124-0-76620";"What were they looking for?"
"204987124-0-76621";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-0-76629";"What became of the glyphics?"
"204987124-0-76630";"Why did you do that?"
"204987124-0-76631";"You're trusting me to make this decision?"
"204987124-0-76632";"Explain this choice to me. Why does it matter that I have both the replica and original talismans?"
"204987124-0-76633";"Explain this choice to me. Why does it matter that I have both the replica and original talismans?"
"204987124-0-76634";"Will failing this heist ruin your reputation?"
"204987124-0-76635";"Why are you trying to help out Rilasi?"
"204987124-0-76636";"What exactly is the significance of the Eye of Baan Dar, anyway?"
"204987124-0-76637";"Tell me about these items."
"204987124-0-76638";"At a cost."
"204987124-0-76640";"Tell me about Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-76641";"Tell me about Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-76642";"Who exactly are we up against?"
"204987124-0-76643";"Tell me about Hermaeus Mora."
"204987124-0-76647";"Very well I will help you return your books."
"204987124-0-76651";"What is the real significance of the Eye to the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-76652";"Do you think the followers of Saint Vorys would do the same for you?"
"204987124-0-76653";"Is it really worthless outside the hands of the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-76654";"Why don't you want the high priest to know the truth about the Talisman of Saint Vorys?"
"204987124-0-76655";"I'll give them the replica talisman that Rilasi made. They won't realize the difference."
"204987124-0-76656";"What is the real significance of the Eye to the Baandari?"
"204987124-0-76657";"How many Black Books are there?"
"204987124-0-76658";"Who exactly are we up against?"
"204987124-0-76659";"How do we find one book in all of this?"
"204987124-0-76661";"Got it."
"204987124-0-76664";"What sort of methods?"
"204987124-0-76665";"All right, I'll see what I can find."
"204987124-0-76666";"Parameters?"
"204987124-0-76667";"Tell me more about Apocrypha and its connection to Nirn."
"204987124-0-76668";"We're searching these stacks for information about the relic, the rite, and the dream."
"204987124-0-76669";"What does that mean exactly?"
"204987124-0-76670";"All of the books we found crumbled before we could get more than a little information out of them."
"204987124-0-76671";"Tell me more about the locations I need to visit."
"204987124-0-76672";"What's your plan now?"
"204987124-0-76673";"I'll join your search for the temporal distortion in Bal Sunnar."
"204987124-0-76678";"Why is stopping the Lark of Rosgard so important to you?"
"204987124-0-76679";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-76680";"Vaermina's servants built a gate to Apocrypha so they could break into the Tranquil Catalog."
"204987124-0-76684";"Tell me more about this spell you plan to use."
"204987124-0-76685";"You said this spell is how you met Madam Whim?"
"204987124-0-76686";"And how did you manage to replace the original with the replica without the high priest noticing?"
"204987124-0-76688";"What did I say?"
"204987124-0-76689";"Do you need a healer?"
"204987124-0-76690";"And now you're burying it with her?"
"204987124-0-76691";"About me being a courier …."
"204987124-0-76693";"These are for you. <Give Rilasi both the replica and the real talismans.>"
"204987124-0-76694";"So you're not going to?"
"204987124-0-76700";"Tell me about Apocrypha."
"204987124-0-76704";"Torvesard altered the memory. He restored the Vaermina statue that Mora shattered to cast his spell."
"204987124-0-76705";"And this will lead us to your master's glyphic?"
"204987124-0-76707";"All right. I'll follow the path."
"204987124-0-76708";"Mora told me that fate's threads have frayed but we can still save Apocrypha and Nirn."
"204987124-0-76709";"The rest of the forgotten memory is contained in two more glyphics."
"204987124-0-76711";"I'll help you find Blightcrown, Leramil."
"204987124-0-76712";"Daedra can change their allegiances?"
"204987124-0-76713";"Daedra can change their allegiances?"
"204987124-0-76714";"A Watcher followed Mephala?"
"204987124-0-76722";"He was proud, and insisted on honoring his agreement."
"204987124-0-76723";"Why do you think Hermaeus Mora changed the pact?"
"204987124-0-76724";"Do you know what you'll do now?"
"204987124-0-76725";"What should I expect in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-76726";"How did you lose your memory in this story?"
"204987124-0-76727";"Have you heard anything else from Mevei lately?"
"204987124-0-76728";"Have you ever told anyone that before?"
"204987124-0-76733";"I wish you the best of luck, Captain."
"204987124-0-76738";"I'll talk things over with Sharp, and we'll get you a sample of tyranite calx from Broken Tusk."
"204987124-0-76751";"What would happen if the scribes gathered secrets for Mephala?"
"204987124-0-76753";"Why can't Zilipif enter the Spiral Skein?"
"204987124-0-76754";"You instructed Hidden Kindred cultists to build a gate in the mine. The villagers wound up dead."
"204987124-0-76755";"Tell me a little more about yourself."
"204987124-0-76756";"Tell me about the relic, the rite, and the door."
"204987124-0-76757";"You instructed Hidden Kindred cultists to build a gate in the mine. The villagers wound up dead."
"204987124-0-76758";"Do you know a Dremora named Torvesard? He stole a relic from the Necrom Necropolis."
"204987124-0-76759";"I see Dusksabers here. Did you send them to seize Hermaeus Mora's glyphics?"
"204987124-0-76760";"The Dusksabers. Did you send them to seize Hermaeus Mora's Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-76763";"What will you be doing in the meantime?"
"204987124-0-76764";"What happens if I tell him?"
"204987124-0-76765";"Dealt with?"
"204987124-0-76766";"Have a good life, Landolvel."
"204987124-0-76768";"Here's a few coins to jog your memory."
"204987124-0-76769";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-76770";"What happens to the old sigils?"
"204987124-0-76772";"I understand. Let's get going."
"204987124-0-76775";"Gadayn's a monk. Maybe he'll come up with something."
"204987124-0-76778";"Who are you and what is this place?"
"204987124-0-76779";"Where can I find these invaders?"
"204987124-0-76783";"So what exactly are you offering?"
"204987124-0-76784";"Why would you help me after all this?"
"204987124-0-76786";"All right. Tell me where to find Blightcrown."
"204987124-0-76787";"The Dusksabers. Did you send them to seize Hermaeus Mora's Emerald Glyphic?"
"204987124-0-76789";"Yes, but you are in the center of Hermaeus Mora's worshippers."
"204987124-0-76791";"Have a good life, Landolvel. I wish you the best."
"204987124-0-76793";"Have a good life, Landolvel."
"204987124-0-76796";"And who's Hermaeus Mora again?"
"204987124-0-76797";"And who's Hermaeus Mora again?"
"204987124-0-76798";"I agree. Have a good life, Landolvel."
"204987124-0-76804";"So it's another mystery to solve?"
"204987124-0-76805";"Where can I find the Mnemonic Fragments?"
"204987124-0-76807";"It seems you aren't the first to come looking for his research."
"204987124-0-76808";"You're going to go straight back to work?"
"204987124-0-76820";"What do you believe?"
"204987124-0-76822";"Tell me about the Floral Atelier."
"204987124-0-76823";"So you're going to kill him?"
"204987124-0-76824";"All right. Let's find the wards."
"204987124-0-76825";"Tell me about the Floral Atelier."
"204987124-0-76826";"I assume there were animals in the Fauna Study?"
"204987124-0-76827";"I assume there were animals in the Fauna Study?"
"204987124-0-76828";"Once inside, why don't I just tell the conclave what Master Shelreni is really up to?"
"204987124-0-76829";"What could they arrest me for?"
"204987124-0-76831";"I need to discuss this with Leramil."
"204987124-0-76832";"I'll start looking."
"204987124-0-76834";"Master Shelreni murdered Magister Meln. He has the right to confront her."
"204987124-0-76836";"Look, if we don't find Shelreni, there's no telling what may happen to you and the other masters."
"204987124-0-76841";"You want me to work for a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-76843";"All right, I'll help you. What do I need to do?"
"204987124-0-76851";"And the fungal blooms from the beetles?"
"204987124-0-76852";"An observant and chatty servant, apparently."
"204987124-0-76853";"Do you talk to him about how he treats you?"
"204987124-0-76854";"What kind of Dremora is Torvesard?"
"204987124-0-76855";"So what now, Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-76857";"All right, I'll return to Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-76859";"But if Torvesard and I saw part of the secret, why isn't reality unraveling? Did you lie to me?"
"204987124-0-76863";"Torvesard reached the glyphic before me. He took it and escaped."
"204987124-0-76867";"So, how do I gain access to Tel Baro?"
"204987124-0-76869";"I'll go get that insignia now."
"204987124-0-76870";"The letter was only signed ""A."" But I found this strange book with her."
"204987124-0-76871";"If you can't read the Numinous Grimoire, why do you care where it is?"
"204987124-0-76872";"Yes. Is it one of the missing tomes you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-76873";"That's right. Is it one of the books you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-76874";"What sort of interests?"
"204987124-0-76875";"What will you do with the Numinous Grimoire?"
"204987124-0-76876";"He plans to cheat death by turning himself into some kind of knowledge-eating spirit."
"204987124-0-76877";"Isn't that just a ghost?"
"204987124-0-76878";"By helping Cipher Akacirn, you endangered others."
"204987124-0-76882";"What can you tell me about Nelfynn?"
"204987124-0-76884";"Very well. Here you go."
"204987124-0-76888";"I want to know more about the missing ciphers."
"204987124-0-76889";"And he thinks the Numinous Rite is the answer?"
"204987124-0-76892";"You don't want to deal with Cipher Akacirn yourself?"
"204987124-0-76894";"I'll find Cipher Akacirn and make sure he stays dead."
"204987124-0-76895";"How can I stop Akacirn?"
"204987124-0-76897";"Why did you help Akacirn?"
"204987124-0-76902";"What can you tell me about Dreyla?"
"204987124-0-76903";"Took advantage of that? How?"
"204987124-0-76904";"What's the Numinous Grimoire about?"
"204987124-0-76905";"What can you tell me about Tlaxalt?"
"204987124-0-76907";"Ambitious? For what?"
"204987124-0-76908";"What can you tell me about Nelfynn?"
"204987124-0-76910";"Could that have lured her into something dangerous?"
"204987124-0-76911";"I'm not a Remnant. Can I still enter the Crux?"
"204987124-0-76917";"How will saving Apocrypha preserve Nirn?"
"204987124-0-76918";"And that means?"
"204987124-0-76919";"Tell me about Apocrypha."
"204987124-0-76920";"Tell me about Apocrypha."
"204987124-0-76924";"What's so important about this delivery, anyway?"
"204987124-0-76928";"Right. So, where can we find Martina Abor?"
"204987124-0-76929";"Beware of what?"
"204987124-0-76930";"I have fears like anyone else."
"204987124-0-76936";"Why are you after Reynila? What do you do, and what does she do?"
"204987124-0-76937";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-76940";"I'll retrieve your lesser Daedra so you can perform in Fargrave."
"204987124-0-76941";"Is there any way we could do that?"
"204987124-0-76943";"All right, Azandar. I'll see you at Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-76944";"Why did you two stop working together?"
"204987124-0-76945";"What do you think got Martina killed?"
"204987124-0-76947";"Why did they try to manipulate fate?"
"204987124-0-76949";"Why is your frayed fate there?"
"204987124-0-76950";"Does it do anything else?"
"204987124-0-76951";"Do you think I'm in danger?"
"204987124-0-76953";"Where can I find Deredrien?"
"204987124-0-76954";"Who's coming, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-76955";"Thank him by getting even?"
"204987124-0-76961";"I fear Vampires."
"204987124-0-76962";"I fear Vampires."
"204987124-0-76963";"Tell me about ghost sight."
"204987124-0-76964";"Why would your job broker put you on a job like this?"
"204987124-0-76966";"You're going to lock the doors?"
"204987124-0-76967";"Deredrien betrayed Reynila to work for the Reformer. We found these notes on his mercenaries."
"204987124-0-76968";"We can head to Gorne and find Reynila."
"204987124-0-76978";"Maybe the cover story wasn't meant to fool you. Maybe he's running from the Reformer."
"204987124-0-76979";"Let's see if Federo is still there."
"204987124-0-76980";"And where do we go to find the spirit of a dead Telvanni master?"
"204987124-0-76983";"How did Federo tell that to you if he's dead?"
"204987124-0-76985";"He has some information we need. That's all."
"204987124-0-76986";"It's been a while since Federo fled. Do you think he'll still be there?"
"204987124-0-76987";"You seem to know a bit more about him than you let on before."
"204987124-0-76988";"You think he'd do that?"
"204987124-0-76991";"What more can you tell us about Sharp's past?"
"204987124-0-76993";"What can you tell us about this Reformer?"
"204987124-0-76994";"Did Deredrien keep helping Reynila after that?"
"204987124-0-76995";"Who is Reynila to you?"
"204987124-0-76997";"What about Peryite? Why is he working with Vaermina?"
"204987124-0-76998";"It's for Federo Endril. He used to broker jobs from the Reformer."
"204987124-0-76999";"Thank you, Mevei."
"204987124-0-77000";"He refused to give up Sharp, and he's agreed to give us all the information he has on the Reformer."
"204987124-0-77001";"So we follow these threads. What then?"
"204987124-0-77003";"All right. Let's see it done."
"204987124-0-77004";"What do we do now?"
"204987124-0-77006";"Sounds good. I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-77008";"We'll figure something out."
"204987124-0-77010";"Are you asking for my help?"
"204987124-0-77011";"Death is a part of life."
"204987124-0-77015";"Fear achieves nothing. Life is a gift. We should make the most of it."
"204987124-0-77019";"You mentioned something called the Hush. What is that?"
"204987124-0-77020";"You mentioned something called the Hush. What is that?"
"204987124-0-77021";"Have you had any run-ins with witches?"
"204987124-0-77024";"You're sure the figurine was cursed?"
"204987124-0-77025";"You lost her?"
"204987124-0-77028";"They'll have to see the world if they're to live in it one day."
"204987124-0-77029";"You collect stolen items?"
"204987124-0-77032";"You mean the Witches Festival? It does bring out the macabre."
"204987124-0-77033";"I'll have to fight Hermaeus Mora's own forces in the bastion?"
"204987124-0-77034";"Your superiors in the Tribunal Temple don't mind?"
"204987124-0-77035";"Odd how?"
"204987124-0-77036";"Tell me about the Painted Eye."
"204987124-0-77037";"You keep saying you're a Mnemonic Fabrication. You're not Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-77038";"<View another recording.>"
"204987124-0-77042";"<View another recording.>"
"204987124-0-77046";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-0-77047";"How do you know all this? Do Ordinators normally serve Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-77048";"Tell me about the foes I'll face in Bastion Nymic."
"204987124-0-77049";"What's this about contacting me by projection?"
"204987124-0-77050";"You're leaving?"
"204987124-0-77053";"Why keep it a secret?"
"204987124-0-77054";"How did you manage to anger Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-77055";"I will."
"204987124-0-77056";"How can Known Things mess with your mind?"
"204987124-0-77057";"What was the truth of the Known Thing you encountered?"
"204987124-0-77059";"Tell me more about the Numinous Rite."
"204987124-0-77062";"I will, thanks."
"204987124-0-77064";"Why can't Nathyn escape on his own?"
"204987124-0-77069";"And we must burn it because?"
"204987124-0-77071";"Tell me about the locket."
"204987124-0-77072";"Tell me about the logbook."
"204987124-0-77073";"The sight of him shattered the lens?"
"204987124-0-77074";"Tell me about the logbook."
"204987124-0-77075";"So, what did you want?"
"204987124-0-77077";"I don't need a curse right now. I'll pay."
"204987124-0-77082";"I don't need a curse right now. I'll pay."
"204987124-0-77083";"And you think she's keeping him in some isolation tower?"
"204987124-0-77084";"What about Torvesard's dream?"
"204987124-0-77087";"How did you end up at Tel Dreloth?"
"204987124-0-77088";"What exactly is she researching?"
"204987124-0-77092";"All right, activate the gateway."
"204987124-0-77094";"And you feel safer out here?"
"204987124-0-77095";"You mean Hollowjack? What does he look like to you?"
"204987124-0-77097";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-77098";"What is it about the Witches Festival that upsets you?"
"204987124-0-77102";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-77103";"What about Torvesard?"
"204987124-0-77104";"You took away everyone's memory of Prince Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-77111";"What did you mean by oversight of this region?"
"204987124-0-77112";"Why do you think the region needs to be watched?"
"204987124-0-77113";"Hermaeus Mora's enemies are searching for a key, a rite, and a forgotten dream."
"204987124-0-77115";"You think Sathile wrote the note, pretending to be Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-77116";"Why can't Nathyn escape on his own?"
"204987124-0-77117";"What do you mean, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-77119";"What happened? Things look different."
"204987124-0-77121";"We'll be careful. You should rest now."
"204987124-0-77123";"We're not leaving until we find Nathyn."
"204987124-0-77125";"Torvesard opened the glyphic and got away. There's still danger, but Mora said it wasn't imminent."
"204987124-0-77128";"Where is your mother now?"
"204987124-0-77129";"You saw something about me. Something you didn't realize."
"204987124-0-77130";"Who is this slaver, and where can we find her?"
"204987124-0-77131";"Perhaps Leramil knows a way to free you. And Curate Gadayn has experience with the dead."
"204987124-0-77133";"Sharp and I will take care of it."
"204987124-0-77135";"What choice?"
"204987124-0-77136";"Are you confident you can even find a cure for Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-77137";"Tell me about Oathman Llaro."
"204987124-0-77138";"Nathyn said it was a symbiote? How does that work?"
"204987124-0-77139";"Then how does it find new hosts?"
"204987124-0-77140";"Are you confident you can even find a cure for Nathyn?"
"204987124-0-77141";"And their spores won't be harmful to one another if they're both inoculated?"
"204987124-0-77144";"Don't read into it. I was only looking for work."
"204987124-0-77145";"How are you connected to Elistrenne Starflower?"
"204987124-0-77147";"You're really coming with us to hunt down the Reformer?"
"204987124-0-77148";"You are free to go. Leave the way we came."
"204987124-0-77149";"You are free to go."
"204987124-0-77150";"You are free to go. Leave the way we came."
"204987124-0-77151";"Can't you change this? Appease Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-77152";"If Hermaeus Mora is angry with you, why will he let you escape the gallery?"
"204987124-0-77154";"Tell me more about the Feral Gallery."
"204987124-0-77155";"Remind me, who are you again?"
"204987124-0-77157";"What does it tell us?"
"204987124-0-77163";"She's with the Reformer and his other slaves in Deshaan. Are you coming with us?"
"204987124-0-77165";"You too. See you soon."
"204987124-0-77168";"What makes one of these frayed fates? Did you make one when you decided what to have for breakfast?"
"204987124-0-77169";"Can you tell me a bit about being an arcanist?"
"204987124-0-77170";"What did you hope to learn?"
"204987124-0-77171";"What is it you do, Azandar?"
"204987124-0-77172";"So we're going to unfray your fate. How are we going to do that?"
"204987124-0-77173";"So we're going to unfray your fate. How are we going to do that?"
"204987124-0-77176";"Get the talon and tomedust and meet you at the site. Got it. See you there."
"204987124-0-77179";"So, you carry secrets?"
"204987124-0-77180";"Do you know anything else about this area?"
"204987124-0-77182";"Find the Voidprowlers, then."
"204987124-0-77183";"We should go recover your secret."
"204987124-0-77185";"I'll track down those reagents."
"204987124-0-77186";"Dreynis warned me that the prism corrupts its owner."
"204987124-0-77189";"There must be some way to follow them, Leramil."
"204987124-0-77190";"I'm with you, Leramil. But how can we ask Master Shelreni anything? She's dead."
"204987124-0-77194";"You talk like you're part of a menagerie."
"204987124-0-77196";"Powerful enemies?"
"204987124-0-77198";"You don't make a lot of sense, Morian."
"204987124-0-77199";"Why did the Dreamcarvers attack?"
"204987124-0-77200";"You don't make a lot of sense, Morian."
"204987124-0-77201";"Who is Cipher Frielvi?"
"204987124-0-77202";"I meant how did you get to Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77203";"Who are the Dreamcarvers?"
"204987124-0-77207";"Thanks, Tem."
"204987124-0-77212";"You called Torvesard one of the Unseen. What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-77214";"What are you most concerned about?"
"204987124-0-77215";"I remember. He seemed fixated on you."
"204987124-0-77216";"Have you heard from Mevei or Dimik-ei since we saw them last?"
"204987124-0-77217";"Maybe Federo will give us some answers to that."
"204987124-0-77218";"It's a start. Thanks."
"204987124-0-77221";"What do we already know about the relic, the rite, and the dream?"
"204987124-0-77222";"Tell me more about the illness affecting the Keepers of the Dead."
"204987124-0-77223";"If the keepers are sick, isn't it prudent to close the Necropolis?"
"204987124-0-77224";"Tell me more about the Necropolis."
"204987124-0-77227";"All right, I'll take Morian to the Forbidden Exhibit."
"204987124-0-77228";"If there's a barrier, how can you escape?"
"204987124-0-77229";"All right, I'll help you escape the barrier keeping you here."
"204987124-0-77234";"And why does that concern Nirn?"
"204987124-0-77235";"Tell me about Vaermina and Peryite."
"204987124-0-77236";"Tell me more about Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-77237";"How can they search for a dream?"
"204987124-0-77238";"How can they find a dream in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77239";"What was your story?"
"204987124-0-77240";"What sort of new ideas?"
"204987124-0-77241";"I'm pretty sure Reynila was the one who wrote you. Mevei mentioned she was keeping tabs on you."
"204987124-0-77242";"Why bury the cache of information on the Reformer?"
"204987124-0-77243";"Reynila's wife. She's the one who forged your documents."
"204987124-0-77244";"Of all the places in Tamriel, why did you decide to escape to Tinkerer Tobin's?"
"204987124-0-77245";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-77246";"I'll tell the port master."
"204987124-0-77247";"If you let me investigate the Stormwing, I can find the proof we need."
"204987124-0-77248";"Did we let it out?"
"204987124-0-77250";"And you think the books crumbled because of some protection Hermaeus Mora has in place?"
"204987124-0-77251";"Are you sure Hermaeus Mora is all right with you leaving the gallery?"
"204987124-0-77253";"And that means?"
"204987124-0-77255";"How do these cairns help us find the entrance to the Infinite Panopticon?"
"204987124-0-77257";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-77264";"You seem very worried about the abbot."
"204987124-0-77266";"What about the city guard? Can they help?"
"204987124-0-77267";"What can you tell me about Peryite?"
"204987124-0-77268";"The cultists built a gateway to Apocrypha. They're looking for something in Hermaeus Mora's realm."
"204987124-0-77269";"What can you tell me about Peryite?"
"204987124-0-77275";"I meant, why do you have a flesh atronach?"
"204987124-0-77276";"Right."
"204987124-0-77277";"That seems incredibly specific."
"204987124-0-77280";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-77282";"And where will I find Prior Durdryn's tomb?"
"204987124-0-77283";"Are Abbot Ilvel and the other keepers going to be all right?"
"204987124-0-77284";"Do you think much about your life before you lost your memory?"
"204987124-0-77287";"Will this be dangeorus?"
"204987124-0-77289";"Are you worried about going back to Kozanset?"
"204987124-0-77291";"How exactly did you come up with this idea for returning Sharp's memories?"
"204987124-0-77292";"So there's another frayed fate nearby?"
"204987124-0-77293";"If you bring your ancestors what they want, that's enough."
"204987124-0-77294";"You don't think she wants to help us find the Reformer?"
"204987124-0-77295";"Maybe that's what her ancestor wants."
"204987124-0-77296";"All right. Let's get to the Underweave."
"204987124-0-77297";"All right. Let's get to the Underweave."
"204987124-0-77298";"I understand. I have some memories of my own that I wouldn't mind losing forever."
"204987124-0-77299";"Let's get to Broken Tusk and find some tyranite calx."
"204987124-0-77300";"Let's get to Broken Tusk and find some tyranite calx."
"204987124-0-77301";"What did you learn from Reynila's work?"
"204987124-0-77302";"Your new tribe?"
"204987124-0-77303";"What was Sharp like when you knew him?"
"204987124-0-77305";"Northeast to the ruins. Let's go!"
"204987124-0-77306";"Do you think he'll act differently if he gets his memories back?"
"204987124-0-77307";"You were allowed to fish?"
"204987124-0-77308";"Where did you last see this book?"
"204987124-0-77309";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-77312";"Wolfhound and Sea Breeze? Not Wolfsbane and Bitter Teas?"
"204987124-0-77313";"How do you know you're right?"
"204987124-0-77314";"You should cast a huge spell."
"204987124-0-77315";"Can you bind him?"
"204987124-0-77316";"I'm familiar with Necrom."
"204987124-0-77319";"So you don't know Dimik-ei. Have you thought about getting to know her?"
"204987124-0-77320";"Have you ever thought about helping her?"
"204987124-0-77321";"All right. Let's start scrying."
"204987124-0-77323";"What is Herm'us Mora to you?"
"204987124-0-77328";"Have you been enjoying your time with your sister?"
"204987124-0-77329";"How have you been adjusting to your new life?"
"204987124-0-77331";"How exactly did you come up with this idea for returning Sharp's memories?"
"204987124-0-77334";"I want to help Sharp. I'm ready."
"204987124-0-77337";"Where is your mother exactly?"
"204987124-0-77339";"Have you been through Shadowfen much before?"
"204987124-0-77340";"And you're sure this process of returning Sharp's memories will work?"
"204987124-0-77341";"Let's get started."
"204987124-0-77342";"All right. Let's see this done."
"204987124-0-77343";"All right. Let's see this done."
"204987124-0-77346";"Why did you two stop working together?"
"204987124-0-77347";"How do assassins help keep the peace?"
"204987124-0-77348";"Sure. Let's keep working together on your project."
"204987124-0-77351";"How can you tell?"
"204987124-0-77352";"How are you going to help him?"
"204987124-0-77353";"What happened to Ansuul?"
"204987124-0-77354";"What happens now?"
"204987124-0-77355";"Here's the book."
"204987124-0-77357";"Very well. Here's the book."
"204987124-0-77360";"Are all mortals in Apocrypha ciphers?"
"204987124-0-77361";"What's the Numinous Grimoire about?"
"204987124-0-77362";"Cipher's Midden?"
"204987124-0-77365";"Will you remain here in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77366";"A library of minds?"
"204987124-0-77367";"Are they prisoners?"
"204987124-0-77369";"I see."
"204987124-0-77370";"Do the vessels die if they try to break free?"
"204987124-0-77371";"Yes. He spoke about his body like it didn't belong to him."
"204987124-0-77373";"All right, let's go investigate the Rectory Archives."
"204987124-0-77374";"How do you actually know Federo?"
"204987124-0-77375";"Where did you say he went, again?"
"204987124-0-77376";"Even if one cipher is killing others?"
"204987124-0-77377";"Tell me more about the Numinous Rite."
"204987124-0-77378";"Did the Reformer offer you anything to turn in Sharp?"
"204987124-0-77380";"I'm Sharp's friend. We met when you put him on the Reynila job."
"204987124-0-77383";"Why didn't you do it?"
"204987124-0-77389";"Why do you still introduce yourself that way?"
"204987124-0-77390";"What's the point in that?"
"204987124-0-77391";"Tell me more about the Numinous Rite."
"204987124-0-77394";"Then how did Akacirn read the book without going mad?"
"204987124-0-77395";"I see Naryu's here, too."
"204987124-0-77396";"All right. Do whatever you think is right."
"204987124-0-77397";"Are you friends?"
"204987124-0-77398";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-77399";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-77400";"If you're not here on business, why are you here?"
"204987124-0-77405";"[Alchemy] You know, I'm familiar with these ingredients. They're toxic."
"204987124-0-77406";"Good to see you again, Federo."
"204987124-0-77407";"I still want to kill you. So I'm guessing not."
"204987124-0-77408";"Finding this pact will lead us to the rogue mind?"
"204987124-0-77410";"All right, let's give it a try."
"204987124-0-77411";"Can you do that?"
"204987124-0-77412";"Tell me how to find the Daggerfall Devil's mind."
"204987124-0-77414";"Let's find these memories."
"204987124-0-77417";"I'm not going to raise your ancestors."
"204987124-0-77424";"It's not just Master Shelreni. She has the support of two Daedric Princes."
"204987124-0-77426";"She's going to kill you all, just like she killed Meln the Mouthless."
"204987124-0-77428";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-77429";"What about Master Marena?"
"204987124-0-77430";"Why do you assume that we want to follow Master Shelreni?"
"204987124-0-77434";"Not much. Master Foves mentioned that he's fearful of the spy and his aide kind of smells lately."
"204987124-0-77438";"Let's do it."
"204987124-0-77439";"The dream that started all this?"
"204987124-0-77440";"I'm glad I could help. Now, let's get to Senalana."
"204987124-0-77441";"Let's get going to Senalana."
"204987124-0-77443";"Tell me more about Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-77445";"So your father believed?"
"204987124-0-77447";"Right, the threat against Apocrypha that also endangers Nirn."
"204987124-0-77448";"Tell me more about Cipher's Midden."
"204987124-0-77451";"There may yet be a part of him that remembers you."
"204987124-0-77452";"Seal our covenant? How?"
"204987124-0-77453";"What's the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-77454";"How was Nilphas behaving oddly?"
"204987124-0-77455";"But what do they mean?"
"204987124-0-77457";"What happens if the Hidden Kindred find the dream in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77458";"Where is the new temple?"
"204987124-0-77460";"Have you heard from Protus?"
"204987124-0-77461";"You're not seriously thinking of accepting that offer?"
"204987124-0-77463";"Let's hope it doesn't come to that."
"204987124-0-77464";"Thoryn said you're a Clockwork Apostle."
"204987124-0-77465";"You did that to your arms on purpose?"
"204987124-0-77466";"What's wrong with it?"
"204987124-0-77467";"Am I supposed to go to Apocrypha now?"
"204987124-0-77471";"What is the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-77472";"What is the Clockwork City?"
"204987124-0-77473";"I've been to the Clockwork City and saved Sotha Sil."
"204987124-0-77474";"Thoryn said you're a Clockwork Apostle."
"204987124-0-77475";"We were about to enter the Mythos to deal with Blightcrown."
"204987124-0-77476";"Hermaeus Mora brings their spirits to a safe port."
"204987124-0-77478";"She trusts a servant for this task?"
"204987124-0-77479";"Isn't it just the masking effect of the corruption that keeps Torvesard hidden?"
"204987124-0-77481";"So you think we should turn back?"
"204987124-0-77482";"Is that the only reason?"
"204987124-0-77485";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-77486";"I'll be here when you're ready to take on the adversary."
"204987124-0-77487";"<View another recording.>"
"204987124-0-77489";"Why is your sanctum in Skywatch?"
"204987124-0-77490";"How has the research been going?"
"204987124-0-77491";"Why is your sanctum in Skywatch?"
"204987124-0-77495";"How did you get in here?"
"204987124-0-77501";"What's your story?"
"204987124-0-77507";"Why do you keep talking like you are Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-77508";"So what now, Torvesard?"
"204987124-0-77509";"What will happen to you after this ends?"
"204987124-0-77513";"You keep saying you're a Mnemonic Fabrication. You're not Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-77514";"Do you know why the Clockwork Probabilis is still functional?"
"204987124-0-77515";"So you experimented in order to understand?"
"204987124-0-77516";"If you knew where this was going, why did you need to tinker?"
"204987124-0-77517";"Nilphas invited the Painted Eye. I defeated him, but Protus is going to be the only caretaker now."
"204987124-0-77518";"Sotha Sil gave Protus new directives. That was one of them."
"204987124-0-77523";"Hermaeus Mora said we could still save reality if we work together, Leramil."
"204987124-0-77524";"Thanks for the information. I'll seek out Deredrien."
"204987124-0-77525";"Delivering flowers? I can do that."
"204987124-0-77527";"No memories of your past? You have amnesia?"
"204987124-0-77528";"So she works alone?"
"204987124-0-77529";"Can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-77530";"Did something happen to start the cycle?"
"204987124-0-77531";"No, I mean tell me about you, specifically."
"204987124-0-77532";"But you are distinct beings."
"204987124-0-77533";"How are we going to contract with Tem?"
"204987124-0-77534";"All right. Let's head to Riften."
"204987124-0-77537";"Tell me more about the Remnants."
"204987124-0-77542";"Before you go, Folsi did promise me something for bringing you that letter."
"204987124-0-77543";"Yes, I think I'll tell Master Sulis."
"204987124-0-77544";"Does he still use Kemel-Ze?"
"204987124-0-77545";"A contradiction in reality?"
"204987124-0-77546";"Fabricants? Factotums?"
"204987124-0-77547";"Who is Nilphas Drethan?"
"204987124-0-77549";"All right, I'll help you. Where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-77550";"You want to duel people in Tribute?"
"204987124-0-77551";"You want to duel people in Tribute?"
"204987124-0-77552";"All right. Do you want to play?"
"204987124-0-77554";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-77556";"All right. I'll be back."
"204987124-0-77558";"You keep saying you're a Mnemonic Fabrication. You're not Sotha Sil?"
"204987124-0-77561";"And then he threw something at the High Astrologer?"
"204987124-0-77562";"I will, thank you."
"204987124-0-77564";"You've got this, Gadayn."
"204987124-0-77566";"Could you tell me who attends the Assembly of Masters meetings?"
"204987124-0-77567";"Thank you for the explanation."
"204987124-0-77568";"He explained the workings of the assembly and how the masters engage in special projects."
"204987124-0-77570";"Isn't there some way to find Torvesard or Blightcrown?"
"204987124-0-77571";"So where is this conclave going to take place?"
"204987124-0-77576";"So we're out of luck?"
"204987124-0-77577";"What can he do in exchange for the paper?"
"204987124-0-77578";"She said you really insulted her. Didn't you ask her to write that commentary?"
"204987124-0-77581";"I'm sure she'll appreciate whatever you have to say."
"204987124-0-77582";"Tell me a little more about yourself."
"204987124-0-77591";"What can I expect at the Prismatic Iris Shore?"
"204987124-0-77592";"If we can't understand them, how will we know what to do?"
"204987124-0-77595";"It sounds like you don't trust the prelate."
"204987124-0-77597";"I can look into Prelate Faram for you."
"204987124-0-77598";"Why is this place more important than the other two sites?"
"204987124-0-77600";"I'll help you investigate Tel Rendys. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-77601";"How have the other Remnants not learned about the Crux?"
"204987124-0-77606";"Really?"
"204987124-0-77607";"Good luck, Rilasi. Take care."
"204987124-0-77608";"Is that what you're doing?"
"204987124-0-77612";"I'll get the soul gem."
"204987124-0-77613";"So he's escaped your capture before? When?"
"204987124-0-77614";"Thanks, Sharp. It's good to see you."
"204987124-0-77615";"What will you be doing while I go to the caravan and the temple?"
"204987124-0-77618";"All right. To Kozanset, then."
"204987124-0-77619";"Better? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-77620";"You're making a mistake. Magister Meln says you can't underestimate Master Shelreni."
"204987124-0-77622";"You said you'd advise me. About what?"
"204987124-0-77624";"I might be available."
"204987124-0-77626";"Well, try not to get caught."
"204987124-0-77628";"You're not eager to get out and see the world?"
"204987124-0-77629";"Why didn't Sathile think of that sooner?"
"204987124-0-77631";"Thanks for the warning, Nilvon. Here's some coin for your trouble."
"204987124-0-77633";"That's seems fair."
"204987124-0-77634";"You're not tired of each other yet?"
"204987124-0-77635";"It's good to see you outside of the tower."
"204987124-0-77636";"She seems pretty intent on catching you, not just playing the fool."
"204987124-0-77640";"How long did you work on the Fateweaver Key?"
"204987124-0-77642";"Why do you think the adversary did what he did?"
"204987124-0-77643";"Do you think you'd ever try to recreate it?"
"204987124-0-77652";"Safe travels to you, Eilirsu-dro."
"204987124-0-77653";"Safe travels, then."
"204987124-0-77654";"What did you come to ask?"
"204987124-0-77660";"The assembly won't blame you for serving Master Shelreni?"
"204987124-0-77661";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-77666";"What do you want to do next?"
"204987124-0-77667";"So back to our travels then, in the meantime."
"204987124-0-77669";"What arch and statue?"
"204987124-0-77671";"What did you end up saying to Rilasi?"
"204987124-0-77672";"What's the story with you and Rilasi?"
"204987124-0-77675";"All right. Let's start toppling."
"204987124-0-77676";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-77677";"Why would Vaermina want to enter Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77679";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77680";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77681";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77682";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77687";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77689";"Why save Vanton? Why not just trap Ansuul?"
"204987124-0-77690";"And the other reason?"
"204987124-0-77691";"You seem fond of Vanton. What happened?"
"204987124-0-77692";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-77694";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77695";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77696";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77697";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77701";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-77705";"Maybe. Safe travels, Dacia."
"204987124-0-77707";"And you. Take care, Nathyn."
"204987124-0-77709";"I hope so. Take care, Nathyn."
"204987124-0-77711";"Glad I could help. Take care, Dacia."
"204987124-0-77715";"Good idea."
"204987124-0-77717";"Good luck, Rilasi."
"204987124-0-77718";"Let's go to the glass mine."
"204987124-0-77719";"Silence?"
"204987124-0-77725";"So Known Things are so powerful, they can turn minds to runny-nose soup?"
"204987124-0-77727";"You're going to find another temple?"
"204987124-0-77733";"Do you know anything more about the secret they're searching for?"
"204987124-0-77734";"What did Hermaeus Mora steal exactly?"
"204987124-0-77735";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-77736";"You don't know anything more specific?"
"204987124-0-77737";"How do you fix this?"
"204987124-0-77738";"What about Peryite? Why is he working with Vaermina?"
"204987124-0-77740";"When did you decide to leave Tel Dreloth together?"
"204987124-0-77741";"Do you think Sathile would let you and Nathyn be together if you weren't planning to leave?"
"204987124-0-77742";"Corrupt? How?"
"204987124-0-77744";"I'll destroy the corrupted scrolls and find Cipher Sabinius."
"204987124-0-77750";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-77751";"Are there any other survivors?"
"204987124-0-77752";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-77753";"Does that mean the client is a Telvanni magister?"
"204987124-0-77756";"An anomalous thread?"
"204987124-0-77758";"If it is the glyphic, we have a chance to find Torvesard and recover it."
"204987124-0-77759";"Very well. Now aid Leramil and Scruut."
"204987124-0-77760";"Torvesard says he can help us with that."
"204987124-0-77761";"Are you willing to share your research with Garalo Givyn?"
"204987124-0-77762";"Friends from the Shivering Isles? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-77764";"Where exactly can we find your notes?"
"204987124-0-77765";"I'll remember that."
"204987124-0-77766";"So these Daedra are feasting on the madness?"
"204987124-0-77767";"You mentioned Straath. Who's that?"
"204987124-0-77768";"What do you mean, they're feuding?"
"204987124-0-77769";"So Straath is the source of your powers?"
"204987124-0-77770";"Where exactly can we find your notes?"
"204987124-0-77772";"What did Hermaeus Mora mean about using the Black Book?"
"204987124-0-77773";"You're worried about Curate Gadayn?"
"204987124-0-77775";"You think the memory is about you?"
"204987124-0-77777";"A Telvanni spellwright?"
"204987124-0-77779";"Does your grandmother help you often?"
"204987124-0-77780";"Do you know what I do with the Black Book?"
"204987124-0-77782";"Isn't even two people with that knowledge dangerous?"
"204987124-0-77783";"Yes. But Hermaeus Mora said that everything that was supposed to happen occurred just as he foresaw."
"204987124-0-77784";"Tell me. What secret was so dangerous it had to be obliterated? What did Mora make you forget?"
"204987124-0-77788";"I'll meet you in Necrom, Gadayn."
"204987124-0-77792";"Have your feelings about your experiment changed?"
"204987124-0-77793";"That sounds very powerful."
"204987124-0-77795";"Can you tell me more about the Unraveling Palimpsest?"
"204987124-0-77796";"Like what?"
"204987124-0-77797";"Hope you find it."
"204987124-0-77798";"Are you sure you're remembering correctly?"
"204987124-0-77799";"Good luck then."
"204987124-0-77800";"If you can't determine who they are, how can I?"
"204987124-0-77802";"And if she's right?"
"204987124-0-77803";"I think you should let Pania Crunus lead the way."
"204987124-0-77805";"You already found Pania's book?"
"204987124-0-77807";"Why not show her now?"
"204987124-0-77809";"Why are you even working with Nassophra?"
"204987124-0-77811";"Yes. Can you tell me how to defeat the Celestials?"
"204987124-0-77813";"Why did you do that?"
"204987124-0-77814";"I'll pay your price, whatever it is."
"204987124-0-77815";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-77816";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-77818";"What are you bringing your great grandmother?"
"204987124-0-77819";"How do you know that her ancestor doesn't want wealth?"
"204987124-0-77820";"How do you know that her ancestor doesn't want wealth?"
"204987124-0-77821";"What are you bringing your great grandmother?"
"204987124-0-77822";"I think you should make something for your ancestors."
"204987124-0-77823";"I think you should make something for your ancestors."
"204987124-0-77827";"Are you going there now?"
"204987124-0-77828";"Is that what you're doing now? Enjoying the scenery?"
"204987124-0-77829";"Are you going there now?"
"204987124-0-77830";"Are you going there now?"
"204987124-0-77834";"What's next for the Necrom Necropolis?"
"204987124-0-77836";"Hermaeus Mora means to make good on Naanurrel's bargain one way or another."
"204987124-0-77838";"How can you restore the fated glyphic?"
"204987124-0-77841";"Hermaeus Mora owes you more than that."
"204987124-0-77844";"I don't think you have to worry about that. What have you been up to since the events in Necrom?"
"204987124-0-77845";"A sabbatical?"
"204987124-0-77846";"We're within his domain. Anything is possible here."
"204987124-0-77847";"And this tincture will cure those headaches?"
"204987124-0-77848";"Mora erased the memory of another Daedric Prince from existence. Ithelia, the Prince of Paths."
"204987124-0-77849";"Tell me about these ingredients."
"204987124-0-77851";"Torvesard isn't clanless. He's an agent of the forgotten Prince. He wants to find the last glyphic."
"204987124-0-77852";"Right. Let's see what Curate Gadayn is going to tell the assembly."
"204987124-0-77854";"How about Nathriin's Commentaries? Who's Nathriin?"
"204987124-0-77855";"Tell me more about the Aetherean Rubric."
"204987124-0-77856";"Tell me more about the Aetherean Rubric."
"204987124-0-77857";"What about Federo? Any word on how he's faring in his new life?"
"204987124-0-77858";"Did you respond?"
"204987124-0-77861";"You wish to accept this new offer?"
"204987124-0-77863";"Understood. I'll talk to him."
"204987124-0-77867";"And you need Ulfengar to do it?"
"204987124-0-77868";"Would closing the mine be that bad?"
"204987124-0-77869";"You said the queen's gland can help reestablish the mine. How does that work, exactly?"
"204987124-0-77874";"Will it be dangerous?"
"204987124-0-77876";"What's all that power for?"
"204987124-0-77878";"Why did you seek out this glyphic?"
"204987124-0-77880";"This glyphic holds your fate?"
"204987124-0-77882";"Take me to Ald Isra."
"204987124-0-77884";"Take me to Necrom."
"204987124-0-77886";"Tell me more about the jobs Ordinator Tilena offers."
"204987124-0-77889";"Tell me about these three champions."
"204987124-0-77890";"How do I get their logonymics?"
"204987124-0-77892";"For now. But I'll break through again soon. I'll step over your corpse and leave with Dimik-ei."
"204987124-0-77894";"Wait, what?"
"204987124-0-77895";"And why does it matter that you and I aren't attuned to it?"
"204987124-0-77896";"Understood. If you're sure, let's get going."
"204987124-0-77898";"How did destroying the key unbind the adversary?"
"204987124-0-77903";"What would happen if they did?"
"204987124-0-77904";"What are the Sidereal Cloisters, exactly?"
"204987124-0-77905";"What sort of cooperation?"
"204987124-0-77907";"All right, I'll help. Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-77908";"All right. Let's get to the Underweave."
"204987124-0-77909";"I'll talk to Wizard Twelvane."
"204987124-0-77912";"All right, I'll meet you in the Esoterica Corporea."
"204987124-0-77913";"Have you encountered a rogue mind before?"
"204987124-0-77914";"So, these mind-sentinels might attack me?"
"204987124-0-77915";"Who is Madam Whim?"
"204987124-0-77916";"How'd you get in her debt?"
"204987124-0-77917";"What's this Fargrave you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-77918";"How does someone carry a secret?"
"204987124-0-77919";"Then, what does the secret you lost look like?"
"204987124-0-77920";"A secret isn't a physical item, though."
"204987124-0-77921";"How's Madam Whim these days?"
"204987124-0-77922";"Black Book?"
"204987124-0-77923";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-77924";"Who are these Voidprowlers that stole the secret?"
"204987124-0-77925";"I'd like to know about the Apogee of the Tormenting Eye."
"204987124-0-77926";"Can you tell me more about the Remnants?"
"204987124-0-77928";"You said it's dangerous. What will we face in the Rectory?"
"204987124-0-77929";"You mentioned a chorus before. What is that?"
"204987124-0-77930";"Do you think they've caused any damage to the Rectory?"
"204987124-0-77931";"How did you wind up in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-77932";"And one of the books sent you here?"
"204987124-0-77933";"You mentioned a chorus before. What were you talking about?"
"204987124-0-77934";"So, you became a cultist as soon as you arrived?"
"204987124-0-77935";"Do you know where it is?"
"204987124-0-77936";"How does your competition look?"
"204987124-0-77938";"I'll go to Bastion Nymic and recover the phylactery."
"204987124-0-77940";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-77944";"How am I supposed to give them these potions?"
"204987124-0-77946";"All right, I'll throw these potions at them from the skyway, then."
"204987124-0-77948";"I made a deal with Hermaeus Mora to save Apocrypha and Nirn. He called me fate's chosen."
"204987124-0-77949";"Master Shelreni has the Black Book. Tell me about the significance of the Pact Primordial."
"204987124-0-77950";"Torvesard?"
"204987124-0-77952";"Understood."
"204987124-0-77954";"So it could be anywhere."
"204987124-0-77956";"Good to know."
"204987124-0-77957";"Who's the person speaking with Master Foves?"
"204987124-0-77958";"What was that argument about?"
"204987124-0-77960";"Anything else I should know to help you determine Tredecim's true identity?"
"204987124-0-77961";"Why is the House Dres camp important?"
"204987124-0-77962";"Do you want to talk about Veya?"
"204987124-0-77963";"What do you want to do?"
"204987124-0-77964";"All right, let's track down the stolen relic."
"204987124-0-77965";"Why are we going to that Mages Guild hall?"
"204987124-0-77966";"I'd like that, Azandar."
"204987124-0-77967";"Where did you get the name, Tredecim?"
"204987124-0-77968";"Why is the House Dres camp important?"
"204987124-0-77969";"Can you tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-77970";"We warned the masters, which helped save them when Master Shelreni tried to kill them all."
"204987124-0-77971";"We followed her to the shrine we saw in the memory. We saved the master she planned to sacrifice."
"204987124-0-77973";"Vaermina used Shelreni to open a path to Apocrypha, but can Princes enter a rival's realm uninvited?"
"204987124-0-77974";"What's the difference between a mouth and a master?"
"204987124-0-77975";"What do you know about the people in this room?"
"204987124-0-77976";"Why does the assembly think they have a spy?"
"204987124-0-77977";"Anyone else I should know about?"
"204987124-0-77979";"What about Peryite? Why is he working with Vaermina?"
"204987124-0-77980";"What's in the Obscured Forum that you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-77981";"Do you know what the secret is?"
"204987124-0-77982";"And you can trade the secret there?"
"204987124-0-77983";"Do you know anything else about this area?"
"204987124-0-77984";"So, you carry secrets?"
"204987124-0-77985";"Maybe Meln's ghost sight can help."
"204987124-0-77987";"I am ready to decide."
"204987124-0-77991";"Why do you think the adversary did what he did?"
"204987124-0-77992";"What made you different from him, then?"
"204987124-0-77993";"So those moments represent how you could have become the Adversary?"
"204987124-0-77997";"Why did you think this dream was so important?"
"204987124-0-77998";"So that's how you got involved with Vaermina and the Hidden Kindred?"
"204987124-0-77999";"But who are you? You have no clan and Hermaeus Mora called you one of the Unseen."
"204987124-0-78000";"Anything else I should know to help you determine Tredecim's true identity?"
"204987124-0-78006";"You lied to me about her Veya's death in Balmora."
"204987124-0-78007";"What changed your mind?"
"204987124-0-78008";"You did what you thought was best."
"204987124-0-78009";"Veya chose her own path."
"204987124-0-78010";"Veya chose her own path."
"204987124-0-78011";"I did what I had to in order to save Summerset."
"204987124-0-78013";"What now?"
"204987124-0-78014";"Should I leave Meln's gem behind?"
"204987124-0-78017";"Any advice before I go to face a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-78019";"How long did you work on the Fateweaver Key?"
"204987124-0-78020";"We have time. It will take Torvesard a while to unlock the glyphic."
"204987124-0-78022";"I'll find another way in."
"204987124-0-78023";"Another Daedric Prince? Do they still exist?"
"204987124-0-78028";"That's a great idea! Just make sure to pay attention. Leramil isn't one to hide her expectations."
"204987124-0-78031";"Just be honest and be yourself, Gadayn. You'll do fine."
"204987124-0-78032";"Of course, Leramil. Are you sure we're finished here? Torvesard still seeks the third glyphic."
"204987124-0-78033";"What about a strange smell?"
"204987124-0-78035";"But he will try again, right? He wants to recover the rest of the memory."
"204987124-0-78036";"Heard any good gossip lately?"
"204987124-0-78037";"Heard any good gossip lately?"
"204987124-0-78040";"I heard you were working on a special project."
"204987124-0-78043";"Naryu and I are working on that."
"204987124-0-78044";"What happened to your mother?"
"204987124-0-78045";"How does this help us exactly?"
"204987124-0-78046";"What if it's too dangerous to unveil those secrets?"
"204987124-0-78047";"Right. So what's your angle?"
"204987124-0-78048";"So how does recovering the pages help us?"
"204987124-0-78049";"I have to choose one of the sisters?"
"204987124-0-78050";"Tell me about this research."
"204987124-0-78051";"And those scattered pages you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-78052";"Masters Sulis, Foves, and Thilse are working on a secret project."
"204987124-0-78053";"Masters Sulis, Foves, and Thilse are working on a secret project."
"204987124-0-78064";"Should we warn Master Sulis about the gold in his bank account?"
"204987124-0-78065";"That's all I could get."
"204987124-0-78073";"What do we know about Tredecim?"
"204987124-0-78074";"How does Tredecim pass information?"
"204987124-0-78075";"Why do you think the maligraphies are so different?"
"204987124-0-78076";"How do you know which maligraphies are hostile?"
"204987124-0-78077";"What do you mean, dead to the archive?"
"204987124-0-78078";"What do you mean, dead to the archive?"
"204987124-0-78079";"Tell me about the attack."
"204987124-0-78080";"Didn't you say to ask for Tyss? A name implies an individual."
"204987124-0-78081";"Tell me about the Dreamcarver attack."
"204987124-0-78083";"Care to tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-78084";"I'll destroy the ritual foci."
"204987124-0-78085";"What do we do?"
"204987124-0-78087";"You recognize the Dreamcarver leader?"
"204987124-0-78088";"Do we know anything about the information Tredecim is passing along?"
"204987124-0-78089";"What do we know about Tredecim?"
"204987124-0-78090";"What do we know about Tredecim?"
"204987124-0-78095";"Any guess as to the spy's identity?"
"204987124-0-78096";"Care to tell me anything else about your secret project?"
"204987124-0-78097";"Any guess as to the spy's identity?"
"204987124-0-78098";"Changed how?"
"204987124-0-78099";"You mentioned something about your aide?"
"204987124-0-78100";"Care to tell me anything about this secret project?"
"204987124-0-78101";"You seem suspicious of Master Sulis."
"204987124-0-78102";"You seem suspicious of Master Sulis."
"204987124-0-78104";"What's our next step?"
"204987124-0-78105";"Someone named Bristleback aided Guitot and forwarded gold into someone named Sparrow's account."
"204987124-0-78106";"Someone named Bristleback aided Guitot and forwarded gold into someone named Sparrow's account."
"204987124-0-78107";"What's our next step?"
"204987124-0-78110";"Sure, I'll help you figure out who Tredecim is."
"204987124-0-78114";"Do you know where this location is?"
"204987124-0-78116";"Do you think we'll run into more of these powerful maligraphies?"
"204987124-0-78118";"Why so many theories?"
"204987124-0-78119";"Why did we only get a fragment of the nymic from this maligraphy?"
"204987124-0-78122";"What did you mean when you called her vivified ink?"
"204987124-0-78124";"How is that possible?"
"204987124-0-78126";"How will finding the nymic help you summon Tho'at Replicanum?"
"204987124-0-78128";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-0-78129";"What happens when we summon Tho'at Replicanum?"
"204987124-0-78131";"You sound so sure that we'll fight."
"204987124-0-78132";"What makes you so sure Tho'at Replicanum has made maligraphies of herself?"
"204987124-0-78134";"And there are other versions of Tho'at Replicanum in the Infinite Archive?"
"204987124-0-78136";"How could this maligraphy drop a fragment of Tho'at's nymic?"
"204987124-0-78141";"What does a filer, like yourself, do?"
"204987124-0-78142";"Yes, I'll take the reward."
"204987124-0-78143";"You're a filer, what do you file?"
"204987124-0-78156";"What's your plan?"
"204987124-0-78158";"I'll help you find Tho'at Replicanum's nymic and defeat her."
"204987124-0-78162";"Fighting book characters doesn't seem that hard."
"204987124-0-78163";"How do you know which maligraphies are hostile?"
"204987124-0-78164";"So, nothing in the archive is connected to each other? Not even this room?"
"204987124-0-78165";"The Index?"
"204987124-0-78166";"How do you know where anything is?"
"204987124-0-78167";"Tell me more about Verses."
"204987124-0-78168";"How do we find the pieces of the nymic?"
"204987124-0-78169";"Why can't we use the same nymic we found last time?"
"204987124-0-78170";"You've never recognized a maligraphy? But you said they were all historical."
"204987124-0-78171";"How could this maligraphy drop a fragment of Tho'at's nymic?"
"204987124-0-78172";"The Fateweaver key uses Dwemer elements?"
"204987124-0-78174";"All right. Let's head inside."
"204987124-0-78176";"Why are you translating Fynboar the Resurrected?"
"204987124-0-78177";"How many languages can you speak?"
"204987124-0-78178";"You seem a little on edge. Are the missing pages the only thing that's wrong?"
"204987124-0-78179";"This room is making you uncomfortable?"
"204987124-0-78180";"So, why don't you organize the shelves to your liking?"
"204987124-0-78181";"How will I know which pages are the ones you want?"
"204987124-0-78182";"<Enter the Infinite Archive>"
"204987124-0-78184";"I'd like to collect my reward now."
"204987124-0-78186";"Thanks for the information. I'll seek out Deredrien."
"204987124-0-78190";"How did she become like this?"
"204987124-0-78193";"Do you know what she wants?"
"204987124-0-78194";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-78195";"You're a filer, what do you file?"
"204987124-0-78197";"How did your father get this tome?"
"204987124-0-78198";"What did he expect to get out of it?"
"204987124-0-78199";"How does this list of relics fit into that?"
"204987124-0-78200";"Why can't you go to the magisters for aid?"
"204987124-0-78201";"It seems you don't agree?"
"204987124-0-78202";"How did your father get this tome?"
"204987124-0-78203";"How did your father get this tome?"
"204987124-0-78204";"What were you hoping to find?"
"204987124-0-78206";"And that's why she was injured?"
"204987124-0-78208";"What more can you tell me about the Infinite Archive?"
"204987124-0-78209";"He yelled at you? What for?"
"204987124-0-78210";"What more can you tell me about the Infinite Archive?"
"204987124-0-78215";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-78217";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78218";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78219";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78220";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-78226";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78227";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78228";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-78229";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-78231";"I'll bear witness to this event."
"204987124-0-78233";"Give them to <<1>>."
"204987124-0-78234";"What can you tell me about Tralise?"
"204987124-0-78235";"What can you tell me about Yensa?"
"204987124-0-78236";"What can you tell me about Yensa?"
"204987124-0-78238";"Where should I look for these pages?"
"204987124-0-78239";"I have not."
"204987124-0-78240";"You really like to duel."
"204987124-0-78241";"What's your advice?"
"204987124-0-78242";"But you lost the duel. Wouldn't that be the time to use your secret skills?"
"204987124-0-78243";"Summon as many allies as you need, it wasn't enough to beat me."
"204987124-0-78246";"How will you do that?"
"204987124-0-78248";"What happened to your mother?"
"204987124-0-78249";"You charmed Ogle into sending the glyphic to be unwoven?"
"204987124-0-78251";"Fine, I'll shut down the nemesis looms. What are they?"
"204987124-0-78252";"Fynboar the Resurrected is a poem?"
"204987124-0-78253";"How's the translation going?"
"204987124-0-78254";"You really don't like the filers."
"204987124-0-78255";"You mentioned Blue Aedral a few times. What exactly is it?"
"204987124-0-78256";"Wait. Lazen's a dog?"
"204987124-0-78257";"Do you think they were after the Blue Aedral?"
"204987124-0-78259";"You mentioned Blue Aedral a few times. What exactly is it?"
"204987124-0-78260";"Earlier, you mentioned Lazen. Who is that?"
"204987124-0-78263";"How did you get to be such a famous duelist?"
"204987124-0-78264";"How can I become a better duelist?"
"204987124-0-78265";"How did you get to be such a famous duelist?"
"204987124-0-78267";"What will you do with him?"
"204987124-0-78269";"Here's the wine I recovered from Legion's Rest."
"204987124-0-78270";"You've never met your bride?"
"204987124-0-78271";"And you said she controlled the beasts?"
"204987124-0-78272";"What if you don't like each other?"
"204987124-0-78274";"Very well, I'll search Fyrelight for your dowry."
"204987124-0-78275";"Very well, I'll search Fyrelight for your dowry."
"204987124-0-78276";"The brigand who robbed you was Amuarel Verdulis."
"204987124-0-78278";"She needed the dowry to run away."
"204987124-0-78279";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78280";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78281";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78282";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78283";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78284";"Why are the Hushed easier to summon here?"
"204987124-0-78285";"Why are the Hushed easier to summon here?"
"204987124-0-78286";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78287";"Capable of dealing with them? It was like my attacks didn't hurt you."
"204987124-0-78288";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78289";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78290";"Why not? Are you worried that you'll keep losing?"
"204987124-0-78291";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78292";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78293";"Are you sure Ithelia is responsible?"
"204987124-0-78294";"What's the Lodge of the Fist?"
"204987124-0-78295";"I'll take my reward."
"204987124-0-78296";"<Enter Oathsworn Pit.>"
"204987124-0-78298";"Yes, I'll help you fight against the Recollection."
"204987124-0-78303";"I have. Leramil asked me to give you her regards, Gadayn."
"204987124-0-78304";"How many other filers are there?"
"204987124-0-78305";"And they all file books?"
"204987124-0-78306";"Remind me who Tho'at Replicanum is."
"204987124-0-78307";"All right, let's find that forge."
"204987124-0-78308";"Sounds easy enough."
"204987124-0-78309";"Seek a blessing? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-78310";"Very well. Where are these shrines?"
"204987124-0-78311";"I have a relic of Hermaeus Mora, the Echonir. It reveals memories."
"204987124-0-78313";"I'm interested in work. Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-78315";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-78316";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-78317";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-78319";"Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-0-78320";"What kinds of tasks do you need help with?"
"204987124-0-78321";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-78322";"You must have some theory."
"204987124-0-78324";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-78325";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-78326";"What do you know about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-78327";"What sorts of threats are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-78328";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78329";"What can you tell me about Spinner Urthrendir?"
"204987124-0-78330";"Do a lot of legionaries have experience with Daedra?"
"204987124-0-78331";"So why are they here now?"
"204987124-0-78332";"So all I have to do is find the Mirrormoor champion and kill it?"
"204987124-0-78333";"I sense a familiar aura about you."
"204987124-0-78334";"Can you tell me more about how to defeat a Mirrormoor incursion?"
"204987124-0-78335";"Who's Count Calantius?"
"204987124-0-78336";"How did you get the rank of tribune?"
"204987124-0-78338";"Where did you get it?"
"204987124-0-78339";"You don't know if it works?"
"204987124-0-78340";"What sort of dangers should I expect inside the ruins?"
"204987124-0-78341";"What exactly is this Aetherial alarum you gave me?"
"204987124-0-78344";"You wanted to help the necromancers?"
"204987124-0-78345";"What's your plan for the Aetherial shards?"
"204987124-0-78346";"You think there's something important about Do'Krin Temple?"
"204987124-0-78348";"You said you and Scruut had an idea?"
"204987124-0-78349";"Ithelia has already changed once. Is there some way we could get her to change again?"
"204987124-0-78350";"And while you're doing that, what should I do?"
"204987124-0-78352";"Devastation? New forest?"
"204987124-0-78353";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-78354";"Yes, I completed the legionary's mission. The signal fires are blazing."
"204987124-0-78359";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-78360";"The Despot of Markarth?"
"204987124-0-78361";"What do you mean, the memory of her was sealed in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-78363";"What is this, exactly?"
"204987124-0-78364";"How do I use the Echonir?"
"204987124-0-78367";"I'm looking for a Dremora named Torvesard."
"204987124-0-78369";"All right. Let's head on in."
"204987124-0-78370";"Everyone in House Ravenwatch is a vampire?"
"204987124-0-78371";"And Gallio Valente is a vampire?"
"204987124-0-78372";"Lord Valente invited his servants to attend the auction?"
"204987124-0-78376";"What can you tell me about Lord Gallio Valente?"
"204987124-0-78377";"Haldain's dead. I found these near his body. He wanted you to have them."
"204987124-0-78381";"You're investigating Lady Weatherleah's death?"
"204987124-0-78382";"A missing fortune? A long-lost son?"
"204987124-0-78384";"What do you think of the grapes we examined and the dead death hound?"
"204987124-0-78385";"And?"
"204987124-0-78386";"And this is bad?"
"204987124-0-78390";"What's that supposed to mean?"
"204987124-0-78391";"And you mentioned that the invitation specifically suggested the vampires bring their servants?"
"204987124-0-78393";"How did you find this case?"
"204987124-0-78394";"Tell me more about <<1>>'s death."
"204987124-0-78395";"Lady Weatherleagh's missing son is alive?"
"204987124-0-78396";"How did you find this case?"
"204987124-0-78397";"Tell me more about <<1>>'s death."
"204987124-0-78398";"Lady Weatherleagh's missing son is alive?"
"204987124-0-78399";"You think the tharriker serve the Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-78400";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-78401";"Why do you call them Ayleid ruins?"
"204987124-0-78402";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-78403";"The note says Torvesard is looking for a relic. A lamp."
"204987124-0-78405";"I have something that might show us. Do you see anything unusual here?"
"204987124-0-78409";"Tell me about the squad of legionaries that never returned."
"204987124-0-78410";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78411";"Anything I should know about the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-78412";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78413";"What about the sentry spheres?"
"204987124-0-78414";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78415";"What kind of information do you want me to look for?"
"204987124-0-78416";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78417";"Are you going to question people, too?"
"204987124-0-78418";"If I destroy the aggression of root, why do I need to post the warning bulletins?"
"204987124-0-78419";"Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?"
"204987124-0-78448";"What led you to look into them?"
"204987124-0-78449";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-78450";"What do you mean, erased her?"
"204987124-0-78451";"So this is about revenge?"
"204987124-0-78452";"Hermaeus Mora says reality itself will be undone if you find Ithelia."
"204987124-0-78453";"Is that what you're looking for here? A relic?"
"204987124-0-78456";"What are you thinking?"
"204987124-0-78458";"Torvesard said they conspired with Hermaeus Mora against Prince Ithelia."
"204987124-0-78462";"All right. Let's go to Holamayan Monastery."
"204987124-0-78475";"But what do they do?"
"204987124-0-78485";"We're looking into relics of Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. A blade, a lamp, and a skein."
"204987124-0-78486";"Why do I need to use portals to travel inside the Infinite Archive?"
"204987124-0-78487";"What do you recommend?"
"204987124-0-78489";"Lead the way."
"204987124-0-78491";"If it's a shrine to Hermaeus Mora, can't he just tell us where it is?"
"204987124-0-78495";"And how do you suggest I do that exactly?"
"204987124-0-78496";"You worship Hermaeus Mora?"
"204987124-0-78497";"Do you know where I can find the Shrine of Inevitable Secrets?"
"204987124-0-78559";"Why did Hermaeus Mora mark me?"
"204987124-0-78560";"What makes you say that?"
"204987124-0-78561";"It sounds like the Recollection wants to force the Oathsworn to join them."
"204987124-0-78562";"Do you know what happened to <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-78564";"Mizzik and I are here to help."
"204987124-0-78565";"Uriel returned after his mother's death?"
"204987124-0-78566";"I'll meet you by the manor when I'm ready."
"204987124-0-78567";"Here's the will. Dog slobber and all."
"204987124-0-78568";"So I use that pattern to unlock the shard? What happens if I make a mistake?"
"204987124-0-78569";"Yes, I'm ready."
"204987124-0-78573";"So you think the deserters came looking for Imperial gold?"
"204987124-0-78578";"Grander deserves to know the truth."
"204987124-0-78579";"What should I tell him?"
"204987124-0-78580";"Magic twisted this place?"
"204987124-0-78582";"He really did want to marry you."
"204987124-0-78583";"Where will you go now?"
"204987124-0-78584";"I better get back to Grander. Goodbye, Amaurel."
"204987124-0-78585";"Remind me, what's so special about the wine?"
"204987124-0-78587";"If she escaped, where would she have gone?"
"204987124-0-78588";"Where are you going?"
"204987124-0-78590";"Torvesard, wait!"
"204987124-0-78591";"Isn't Ithelia the Prince of Paths?"
"204987124-0-78593";"I'm not sure what you're talking about."
"204987124-0-78594";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-78595";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-78596";"He's mingling, but I can pass along a message if you want."
"204987124-0-78597";"Is Black-Glove Garm always this obstinate?"
"204987124-0-78598";"I will help question the family members."
"204987124-0-78599";"Right. I'll do that."
"204987124-0-78600";"Is the Lodge of the Axe in trouble?"
"204987124-0-78601";"What do you know of Lady Weatherleah's death?"
"204987124-0-78602";"Why was it too late?"
"204987124-0-78603";"Magical relics caused this?"
"204987124-0-78604";"Will you try to retake the town?"
"204987124-0-78606";"Who found her?"
"204987124-0-78607";"Maybe. Good luck, Toutis."
"204987124-0-78608";"Are you thinking of trying that yourself?"
"204987124-0-78609";"Do you have any proof he's lying?"
"204987124-0-78610";"Why are you so suspicious of Uriel?"
"204987124-0-78611";"What does Pelena think?"
"204987124-0-78612";"You lost your memories?"
"204987124-0-78613";"Do you share Aquilia's doubts about your mother's death?"
"204987124-0-78614";"So now you remember everything?"
"204987124-0-78615";"Is there anyone who would want to hurt your mother?"
"204987124-0-78617";"Could someone on staff have hurt your mother?"
"204987124-0-78618";"Who found her body?"
"204987124-0-78619";"Betu listens to your commands?"
"204987124-0-78620";"You fired the cook?"
"204987124-0-78621";"What sort of mischief?"
"204987124-0-78623";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-78624";"Did you see anyone else?"
"204987124-0-78625";"She was dead?"
"204987124-0-78626";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-78627";"Is there anyone who would want to hurt <<1>>?"
"204987124-0-78629";"There must be some explanation."
"204987124-0-78631";"Could Otho have staged the scene?"
"204987124-0-78632";"What was that about the threads of fate?"
"204987124-0-78634";"I'll help you deal with the threat of Ithelia. Where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-78635";"At Ostumir, I learned that the Recollection used a wildburn seed to create the new forest."
"204987124-0-78636";"The One Who Knows?"
"204987124-0-78638";"I stopped the Recollection and Shardmarshal Vargas from using Rustwall Estate to invade Skingrad."
"204987124-0-78639";"I've already been to a place you mentioned."
"204987124-0-78643";"Have you tried the wine? What does it taste like?"
"204987124-0-78653";"You're in the Imperial Legion. Isn't fighting part of the job?"
"204987124-0-78654";"Legionary Calvo was mostly useless in there, so he volunteered to remain behind and ring the bell."
"204987124-0-78658";"She seemed as interested in finding out what her husband is up to as you are."
"204987124-0-78660";"How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?"
"204987124-0-78661";"How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?"
"204987124-0-78662";"How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?"
"204987124-0-78663";"So if a non-vampire drinks the wine, then a vampire drains them and gains power?"
"204987124-0-78665";"What about the confession?"
"204987124-0-78666";"Do you think the note is a forgery?"
"204987124-0-78667";"What do we know so far?"
"204987124-0-78668";"We found him dead by the estate fountain."
"204987124-0-78670";"And you know where we need to go to find the items the captain mentioned?"
"204987124-0-78672";"I didn't say he killed himself."
"204987124-0-78673";"Why does the confession say you were present for Lady Weatherleah's death?"
"204987124-0-78675";"Are you accusing Otho of aiding with the murder?"
"204987124-0-78676";"Edric is dead. He left this note confessing to poisoning <<1>>'s tea."
"204987124-0-78677";"Pelena was here? She said she forgot about having tea that morning."
"204987124-0-78678";"Are you saying Edric didn't write this?"
"204987124-0-78679";"The relic you gave me? Yes. What does it do again?"
"204987124-0-78680";"How does it work?"
"204987124-0-78681";"When did you get it?"
"204987124-0-78682";"Can you tell me anything about the Ayleids?"
"204987124-0-78683";"But Lady Weatherleah was found in the library?"
"204987124-0-78685";"So Pelena and the imposter Theophan …."
"204987124-0-78686";"Are you sensing the Echonir?"
"204987124-0-78688";"I'm not sure about this, but I guess I need to see the memory, too."
"204987124-0-78689";"It's over, Pelena."
"204987124-0-78693";"What of the missing fortune?"
"204987124-0-78695";"We must have missed something."
"204987124-0-78696";"All right. I'll pour the cure on these victims."
"204987124-0-78697";"He was an imposter. He wanted a cut of the fortune after helping kill Uriel."
"204987124-0-78699";"Actually, we found the missing fortune along with a letter from Lady Weatherleah."
"204987124-0-78700";"Any idea where to find Lord Valente's laboratory?"
"204987124-0-78703";"Can you tell me more about Leftwheal?"
"204987124-0-78704";"We can still help them."
"204987124-0-78705";"Isn't that why you chose a mortal to help you? Because we see things differently from you?"
"204987124-0-78706";"Ithelia can find a distant reality without magicka. Where she would have no power and pose no harm."
"204987124-0-78707";"Do the Many Paths only lead to alternate realities?"
"204987124-0-78708";"Is such a path possible? What would we need to do to make that happen?"
"204987124-0-78715";"Stay safe, Legionary Calvo."
"204987124-0-78716";"So you're a cultist?"
"204987124-0-78717";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-78718";"Remind me about Leramil the Wise."
"204987124-0-78719";"Do you know what the Blind wants?"
"204987124-0-78720";"I'll take my reward now."
"204987124-0-78721";"<Enter Bedlam Veil.>"
"204987124-0-78723";"I'll defeat the Blind and the cultists invading Bedlam Veil."
"204987124-0-78728";"There were some Recollection cultists in the camp."
"204987124-0-78729";"What will you do?"
"204987124-0-78730";"Maybe one day."
"204987124-0-78731";"Then will you rebuild?"
"204987124-0-78732";"What's our next step?"
"204987124-0-78734";"Do you know Tribune Alea?"
"204987124-0-78737";"The Recollection is attacking?"
"204987124-0-78738";"Who was Ithelia? What happened to her?"
"204987124-0-78739";"How did Torvesard remember her if everyone else forgot?"
"204987124-0-78740";"You said Torvesard already opened two glyphics?"
"204987124-0-78741";"I'll stop their rituals and save any remaining civilians."
"204987124-0-78742";"Rituals?"
"204987124-0-78743";"I thought Torvesard couldn't get back into the Mythos."
"204987124-0-78745";"What is this, exactly?"
"204987124-0-78746";"How do I use the Echonir?"
"204987124-0-78753";"Can you tell which locations these marks indicate?"
"204987124-0-78754";"He was. He sacrificed himself to save me from that reality tear."
"204987124-0-78755";"And what about the relics? Is it safe to just leave them lying around out there?"
"204987124-0-78756";"What are you going to do?"
"204987124-0-78758";"But you said the Skein is showing you places where the Staff of Many Paths is being used."
"204987124-0-78759";"But not all the Wood Elves who originally followed Nantharion are part of the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-78761";"You mean everyone will forget everything that happened in Necrom and West Weald?"
"204987124-0-78762";"Will I forget her as well?"
"204987124-0-78766";"But?"
"204987124-0-78767";"What's a greenspring seed?"
"204987124-0-78771";"I destroyed the seeds. But the Recollection wiped out the farm and a Wood Elf camp at the Hollow."
"204987124-0-78774";"You really don't remember the forgotten Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-78776";"Greenspeaker Sorilen is from Vashabar, right? She's a member of the Recollection."
"204987124-0-78777";"We also took a corrupted wildburn seed from the Recollection. We gave it to Greenspeaker Darolith."
"204987124-0-78780";"All right. We'll check in at Hoperoot if we learn anything more."
"204987124-0-78781";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-78783";"What could King Nantharion and Ithelia do with that much magicka?"
"204987124-0-78784";"Very well. I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-78786";"More than Shardborn and Recollection?"
"204987124-0-78787";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-78790";"What are we searching for?"
"204987124-0-78791";"You were an adventurer?"
"204987124-0-78792";"Can you tell me anything more about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-78793";"Won't they go warn Balandrus that you're here?"
"204987124-0-78794";"Those vampires recognized you."
"204987124-0-78795";"Could Tham still be alive?"
"204987124-0-78796";"He doesn't think any of his people are involved. He asked us to report to him if we learn any more."
"204987124-0-78798";"I'll see you there."
"204987124-0-78799";"The Skein of Secrets. King Nantharion and Ithelia are looking for the Well of Miscarcand."
"204987124-0-78801";"You said the letter mentioned survivors …."
"204987124-0-78802";"All right, let's go to the bank."
"204987124-0-78805";"I met Ithelia at the Outcast Inn. I helped her remember herself and acquired the Lamp of Clarity."
"204987124-0-78808";"Any sign of King Nantharion here?"
"204987124-0-78810";"All right. Let's scout the perimeter."
"204987124-0-78811";"Where does the path to the north lead?"
"204987124-0-78813";"All right. Follow me."
"204987124-0-78814";"You think the Skein of Secrets is beyond those doors?"
"204987124-0-78816";"Could the relics help? The Lamp of Clarity reveals things and Abolisher opens portals."
"204987124-0-78817";"What do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-78819";"Very well. I'll see you in Skingrad."
"204987124-0-78820";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-78821";"Should I go there before I investigate the Outcast Inn?"
"204987124-0-78824";"If Ithelia went back to her own realm, why is fate fraying?"
"204987124-0-78825";"Tham was here?"
"204987124-0-78826";"We'll see if we can find Grivier."
"204987124-0-78828";"The note suggested they stowed Grivier in the stables. Let's go see."
"204987124-0-78829";"Maerenah isn't part of the gang anymore. And she's no longer a vampire."
"204987124-0-78830";"What about Tham? Your wife said he was with you. And where is Balandrus hiding out?"
"204987124-0-78831";"Why are the vampires stockpiling weapons?"
"204987124-0-78832";"So we head into the mine?"
"204987124-0-78833";"Maybe we can use the Skein of Secrets to track them to Miscarcand."
"204987124-0-78834";"Grivier deserves to be punished, but his family doesn't. Let him go so he can help them."
"204987124-0-78837";"How about you? Are you ready?"
"204987124-0-78840";"King Nantharion said he was going to Hoperoot to oversee the establishment of the new settlement."
"204987124-0-78843";"Very well. I'll see you outside Hoperoot."
"204987124-0-78847";"Life took a different course? I believe that."
"204987124-0-78848";"What are you doing now?"
"204987124-0-78849";"What are you even doing here, King Bazrag?"
"204987124-0-78850";"Who's Black-Glove Garm?"
"204987124-0-78851";"You went on a diplomatic mission alone?"
"204987124-0-78852";"Then what are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-78853";"Then what are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-78857";"Who's Black-Glove Garm?"
"204987124-0-78858";"What's the purpose of the signal fires again?"
"204987124-0-78860";"There seem to be a lot of Stonefire cultists here."
"204987124-0-78861";"What is this place?"
"204987124-0-78862";"The Lodge of the Fist? How many lodges are there?"
"204987124-0-78863";"And Black-Glove Garm leads all those lodges?"
"204987124-0-78864";"How do you know so much about the Oathsworn Pit?"
"204987124-0-78865";"Why does the leader of the Lodge of the Forge get to be the Pitmaster?"
"204987124-0-78866";"How do you know so much about the Oathsworn Pit?"
"204987124-0-78867";"It sounds like you know her pretty well."
"204987124-0-78868";"Is Black-Glove Garm always this obstinate?"
"204987124-0-78869";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-78870";"Why did the Recollection attack?"
"204987124-0-78873";"Why did the Recollection attack?"
"204987124-0-78874";"Is the Lodge of the Axe in trouble?"
"204987124-0-78878";"What brought you to Niryastare?"
"204987124-0-78880";"What can you tell me about the last time you were here?"
"204987124-0-78881";"Ithelia mentioned the Many Paths. And a tavern where they converge."
"204987124-0-78883";"All right. I'll keep my eyes open."
"204987124-0-78885";"How will I recognize Dulzush Forgefire?"
"204987124-0-78886";"What's the Staff of Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-78892";"What if he tries to turn you back into a vampire?"
"204987124-0-78894";"All right. Let's head to the mine."
"204987124-0-78895";"Why does the Staff of Many Paths matter?"
"204987124-0-78896";"Who has the answers you're looking for?"
"204987124-0-78898";"And you're sure you're no longer a vampire?"
"204987124-0-78900";"And Tham owns the tavern?"
"204987124-0-78901";"Why do you think Balandrus came back here?"
"204987124-0-78902";"What should I know about the Terror of the Weald and his gang of vampires?"
"204987124-0-78911";"Change?"
"204987124-0-78913";"That's when you decided to leave and find a cure?"
"204987124-0-78914";"If I wanted to make something explode, what would you suggest?"
"204987124-0-78919";"Won't they notice that I'm not a vampire?"
"204987124-0-78920";"All right. Let's head into the auction."
"204987124-0-78922";"What's so mysterious about it?"
"204987124-0-78923";"What are you going to do now?"
"204987124-0-78924";"How long has the staff been in the Oathsworn Pit?"
"204987124-0-78925";"There are Oathsworn beyond the pit?"
"204987124-0-78926";"About the lodge leaders, Axeborn Khurga is dead."
"204987124-0-78927";"What's the Staff of Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-78928";"It looked like he was using it to conduct the ritual with the wildburn seed."
"204987124-0-78931";"Here's the map. I'll meet you at your townhouse in Skingrad."
"204987124-0-78933";"The note says this Groundskeeper Gaius has the only key."
"204987124-0-78934";"I saw an Echonir vision in Hoperoot. A memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn."
"204987124-0-78937";"That's not all?"
"204987124-0-78938";"Tell me about the Lodge of the Axe."
"204987124-0-78939";"All right. I'll ask around."
"204987124-0-78940";"Let's go find Groundskeeper Gaius."
"204987124-0-78941";"What happened to the legionaries who disappeared?"
"204987124-0-78943";"All right, we'll go get the survivors. Where did you hide the catacomb key?"
"204987124-0-78945";"Why is Tho'at creating all these maligraphies? What does she want?"
"204987124-0-78946";"All right, let's return to Grahtwood."
"204987124-0-78948";"Right. I'll do that."
"204987124-0-78950";"Right. Enjoy the party."
"204987124-0-78951";"Right. Enjoy the party."
"204987124-0-78952";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-78954";"All right. Let's go stop Ithelia."
"204987124-0-78955";"And you'll contact me as soon as you learn anything?"
"204987124-0-78958";"So how do we fix these holes in reality?"
"204987124-0-78967";"At Ostumir, I learned that the Recollection used a wildburn seed to create the new forest."
"204987124-0-78973";"But what about the Ithelias I met on the Many Paths? They were each different from each other."
"204987124-0-78974";"What sort of problems?"
"204987124-0-78978";"How do we do that?"
"204987124-0-78981";"Can we use the Lamp of Clarity to find them?"
"204987124-0-78985";"Why does the ritual need to be stopped?"
"204987124-0-78988";"Why are you interested in Rustwall Estate?"
"204987124-0-78989";"That sounds intriguing. What did you find?"
"204987124-0-78992";"I'll head out to investigate those sites now."
"204987124-0-78993";"What was that about a new forest?"
"204987124-0-78994";"What's going on at Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-78995";"What's going on at Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-78997";"All right, let's enter the Ayleid ruins."
"204987124-0-78998";"Why do you think these deserters took control of Fort Colovia?"
"204987124-0-78999";"Allies?"
"204987124-0-79000";"I've already been to a place you mentioned."
"204987124-0-79001";"How can we stop the ritual?"
"204987124-0-79002";"How can we stop the ritual?"
"204987124-0-79005";"Leramil is grieving. Can't you tell me what to do, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-79007";"What else should I know about Elenglynn?"
"204987124-0-79008";"Why would the Recollection be interested in Ayleid ruins?"
"204987124-0-79010";"All right, I'll keep the Echonir handy."
"204987124-0-79011";"Ithelia protected the Loom? How?"
"204987124-0-79015";"So what should we do?"
"204987124-0-79017";"Who's King Dynar?"
"204987124-0-79018";"Tell me more about the Recollection."
"204987124-0-79019";"That's four retainers. Who was the fifth?"
"204987124-0-79020";"She strikes me as being very capable."
"204987124-0-79021";"Then how do we solve this?"
"204987124-0-79022";"Living statues?"
"204987124-0-79023";"They all came from different directions, and took different amounts of time?"
"204987124-0-79024";"Hang on. This grate looks like those earlier traps. There may be a mechanism to disarm it somewhere."
"204987124-0-79025";"He may be a while."
"204987124-0-79035";"So that's why you've come to Wendir?"
"204987124-0-79036";"So that's why you've come to Wendir?"
"204987124-0-79037";"Where's Tribune Alea?"
"204987124-0-79039";"Could we escape from this prison through the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-79041";"So what do we do, then?"
"204987124-0-79045";"What needs to be done?"
"204987124-0-79047";"I have more questions."
"204987124-0-79050";"What does a show typically consist of?"
"204987124-0-79051";"Sounds like you admire the Recollection."
"204987124-0-79053";"What were those Daedra doing in the ruins?"
"204987124-0-79054";"So you can solve this then?"
"204987124-0-79055";"So you can solve this then?"
"204987124-0-79057";"Fine. Let me look at this epitaph."
"204987124-0-79058";"Indeed. You never know."
"204987124-0-79064";"The wildburn seed?"
"204987124-0-79066";"So what's a Wood Elf doing living in Skingrad?"
"204987124-0-79067";"You said no Bosmer who honors the Green would deal with a wildburn seed. What about Sorilen?"
"204987124-0-79068";"So why is Greenspeaker Sorilen working with the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79069";"You're lucky to have her."
"204987124-0-79070";"You're lucky to have her."
"204987124-0-79072";"Rock solid. That's one way of putting it."
"204987124-0-79073";"What's the Foundation Core?"
"204987124-0-79074";"Sounds like you're pretty important."
"204987124-0-79076";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-79077";"What protection does Fa-Nuit-Hen provide?"
"204987124-0-79079";"Who are the Blind's enemies?"
"204987124-0-79080";"I'd like to hear more about your traveling show."
"204987124-0-79081";"You really care about Betu, don't you?"
"204987124-0-79083";"And Betu?"
"204987124-0-79085";"How do you feel about this arrangement?"
"204987124-0-79086";"But we just solved a crime!"
"204987124-0-79088";"Do the creatures perform any tricks?"
"204987124-0-79089";"You destroy the creatures in your show?"
"204987124-0-79090";"So what of the imposter?"
"204987124-0-79091";"And now the cook is dead."
"204987124-0-79092";"Tell me more about yourself."
"204987124-0-79093";"What's our next move?"
"204987124-0-79095";"How does a fortune go missing?"
"204987124-0-79096";"What do you think?"
"204987124-0-79097";"Tell me about being an investigator."
"204987124-0-79098";"Is that all?"
"204987124-0-79124";"She hasn't made any requests?"
"204987124-0-79126";"I'll go get water from the well for you."
"204987124-0-79127";"Why do you call them shadows?"
"204987124-0-79128";"He's studying statues right now. Couldn't budge him. You should go on without him."
"204987124-0-79130";"It was a pleasure to work with you, Elfbetta."
"204987124-0-79131";"Any plans after that?"
"204987124-0-79132";"So you have control over your portal magic again?"
"204987124-0-79133";"This performance in Fargrave seems important to you."
"204987124-0-79134";"What does your show typically consist of?"
"204987124-0-79135";"The Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-79136";"Tell me more about the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-79137";"Dawnwood? Valenwood? King Nantharion?"
"204987124-0-79138";"This corruption and strange energy you sensed. Do you know what it is?"
"204987124-0-79139";"You just decided to found a kingdom in West Weald?"
"204987124-0-79140";"I understand that some Wood Elves here don't follow the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-79155";"What do you mean, the roots of the Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-79156";"What did you remember?"
"204987124-0-79157";"How do you mean different?"
"204987124-0-79159";"I'll search the inn's courtyard for the book on obscure drinks."
"204987124-0-79160";"What can you substitute for those ingredients?"
"204987124-0-79163";"I'll go look for sugar in the cellar."
"204987124-0-79164";"What are the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-79165";"You said the inn drew you to it?"
"204987124-0-79167";"I'll ask the innkeeper to make a Sage's Dream for you."
"204987124-0-79168";"All right, I'll get the lamp."
"204987124-0-79172";"Ithelia asked for a drink called Sage's Dream. She thinks it will help bring her clarity."
"204987124-0-79173";"Can you describe the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-79176";"You're jealous of me?"
"204987124-0-79179";"Ithelia, wait!"
"204987124-0-79182";"There's nothing left of the shrine?"
"204987124-0-79183";"That sounds more like a myth than history."
"204987124-0-79192";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"204987124-0-79193";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"204987124-0-79196";"What's the purpose of the signal fires again?"
"204987124-0-79197";"What will you do with the captured Recollection soldier?"
"204987124-0-79198";"You think the Wood Elves can't be trusted?"
"204987124-0-79199";"What was that about an overgrowth?"
"204987124-0-79200";"Why do you think the Wood Elves can't be trusted?"
"204987124-0-79201";"You mentioned the Many Paths. What are those?"
"204987124-0-79203";"I'll ask the innkeeper to make a Sage's Dream for you."
"204987124-0-79204";"How old is Skingrad?"
"204987124-0-79211";"What can you tell me about Yabren's father?"
"204987124-0-79226";"I am, but I travel a lot."
"204987124-0-79232";"Constable Ulbren's notebook indicated that he was planning to talk to you."
"204987124-0-79233";"What's your role in the West Weald Legion?"
"204987124-0-79234";"What's your role in the West Weald Legion?"
"204987124-0-79237";"So your business hasn't suffered due to fatigue fever?"
"204987124-0-79238";"We're looking into the deaths related to fatigue fever."
"204987124-0-79242";"It seems suspicious that both the town healer and Constable Ulbren died from the illness."
"204987124-0-79245";"Constable Yabren thinks Baron Carvain or Lady Raxalee are responsible in some way?"
"204987124-0-79246";"Where can I find the manor and tower?"
"204987124-0-79253";"What else can you tell me about the maligraphies?"
"204987124-0-79260";"Can we help him?"
"204987124-0-79262";"So how do we get rid of every copy of Tho'at Replicanum?"
"204987124-0-79264";"There are fewer maligraphies in there to attack you."
"204987124-0-79265";"Ghrakug, stay with me!"
"204987124-0-79279";"Tell me what you're doing here."
"204987124-0-79280";"And something went wrong?"
"204987124-0-79285";"Keeps things interesting."
"204987124-0-79286";"And the Lamp of Clarity?"
"204987124-0-79287";"How exactly do these relics work?"
"204987124-0-79289";"The Skein of Secrets?"
"204987124-0-79290";"Pelena Weatherleah?"
"204987124-0-79293";"And?"
"204987124-0-79294";"There were others here?"
"204987124-0-79304";"Apparently I must."
"204987124-0-79305";"What changed your mind?"
"204987124-0-79306";"What's next, Beragon?"
"204987124-0-79308";"I need to tell you, Ghrakug didn't make it. He died from his wounds."
"204987124-0-79310";"All right, let's go to the bank."
"204987124-0-79312";"What happens now, Constable Yabren?"
"204987124-0-79313";"Why do you want me to check your father's office?"
"204987124-0-79314";"How do I know which one is correct?"
"204987124-0-79315";"You don't know, do you?"
"204987124-0-79317";"Why is the Recollection seeking these relics now?"
"204987124-0-79318";"What did we discover?"
"204987124-0-79319";"What do Shardmarshal Vargas and King Nantharion want?"
"204987124-0-79327";"The whistle."
"204987124-0-79328";"How about the compass?"
"204987124-0-79329";"You mentioned we can communicate through it?"
"204987124-0-79330";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-0-79331";"What about the whistle?"
"204987124-0-79336";"Remind me who you are again."
"204987124-0-79339";"Then how do we restore the welkynd stone?"
"204987124-0-79341";"What's the Index?"
"204987124-0-79342";"What sort of barriers?"
"204987124-0-79343";"What's the Echonir?"
"204987124-0-79346";"You think we can use the relics against Ithelia and her servants?"
"204987124-0-79347";"How? The gate is closed and we don't have any Boethiah, Azura, or Mephala relics."
"204987124-0-79348";"Who's Commander Merian?"
"204987124-0-79352";"The commander?"
"204987124-0-79355";"Let's investigate the barracks."
"204987124-0-79356";"What do you want us to do?"
"204987124-0-79357";"How will resetting traps and burning ropes help exactly?"
"204987124-0-79359";"I'll reset the traps and burn the ropes."
"204987124-0-79360";"So Feldagard Keep is safe now?"
"204987124-0-79364";"All right. Which way do you want me to go?"
"204987124-0-79367";"All right, let's do this."
"204987124-0-79372";"You look injured."
"204987124-0-79387";"Why make replicas of your arena challenges if the arenas are still in your realm?"
"204987124-0-79388";"It sounded like the Blind knew you."
"204987124-0-79389";"How will things be interesting?"
"204987124-0-79390";"Why were you were hunting the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79391";"Is King Nantharion here?"
"204987124-0-79392";"You said Recollection forces were close. Where?"
"204987124-0-79394";"And that's why you sent a Legion cohort here?"
"204987124-0-79395";"You deserted? Aren't you afraid of getting caught?"
"204987124-0-79396";"So what are your plans?"
"204987124-0-79410";"How can I help?"
"204987124-0-79414";"What are your options?"
"204987124-0-79415";"I've got Abolisher. Maybe I can open a portal."
"204987124-0-79418";"Why?"
"204987124-0-79423";"She should start in the front."
"204987124-0-79428";"What do you do for Fa-Nuit-Hen?"
"204987124-0-79431";"You should juggle swords."
"204987124-0-79432";"Aetherial alarum? What is this?"
"204987124-0-79436";"He should pretend to sleep."
"204987124-0-79439";"The couple wants you to gather supplies for their travel. Will you help them?"
"204987124-0-79440";"I came to tell you that Clendagal plans to leave the village so he and Laeni can wed."
"204987124-0-79441";"I came to tell you that Laeni plans to leave the village so she and Clendagal can wed."
"204987124-0-79442";"Why would they stay if they can't get married?"
"204987124-0-79443";"Ciiril was hoping you might ask the couple to stay."
"204987124-0-79444";"Ciiril hoped you might convince the couple to stay."
"204987124-0-79445";"One of the villagers mentioned a place called the Wilderhall?"
"204987124-0-79446";"One of the villagers mentioned I should speak to him, and Spinner Belwelas came through."
"204987124-0-79448";"It was Spinner Belwelas's idea. Ciiril is already gathering the villagers."
"204987124-0-79449";"Why does it represent you to the village?"
"204987124-0-79450";"So this mosaic would represent your commitment to the village and to your family?"
"204987124-0-79451";"You said you wanted Laeni and Clendagal to remain in Vashabar. This can make that happen."
"204987124-0-79456";"You're talking about the differences between the Green Pact and the Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-79458";"Is today the first time you spoke of leaving?"
"204987124-0-79459";"What do they disagree on?"
"204987124-0-79460";"Are you thinking of becoming a necromancer?"
"204987124-0-79462";"I'll remember that. Good luck, Beragon."
"204987124-0-79466";"I'll give them the jagga and see what they have to say. See you at the stables."
"204987124-0-79467";"Laeni seemed sure they wouldn't change their minds."
"204987124-0-79468";"Sounds exciting."
"204987124-0-79471";"Why do you think these deserters took control of Fort Colovia?"
"204987124-0-79472";"Well, enjoy the rest of your jagga. Thank you for talking to me."
"204987124-0-79477";"He can't marry Laeni and support the village at the same time?"
"204987124-0-79479";"Well, enjoy the rest of your jagga. Thank you for talking to me."
"204987124-0-79481";"What do the historical accounts say?"
"204987124-0-79482";"How did Miscarcand fall, then?"
"204987124-0-79483";"Nantharion really thought he could resurrect the Ayleid Empire?"
"204987124-0-79485";"What do you think Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas are going to do?"
"204987124-0-79488";"I could help you try to retake it."
"204987124-0-79489";"How about Eveli Sharp-Arrow? Is she here, too?"
"204987124-0-79490";"Can you tell me anything more about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79491";"Can you tell me anything more about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79492";"I can do that. Who should I speak to?"
"204987124-0-79496";"All right, I'll see if Gundelion and Malaniel would be willing to help."
"204987124-0-79497";"The Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79498";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-79499";"You said someone stole a staff from Oathsworn Pit?"
"204987124-0-79500";"There are plenty of wolves in the den, Grander."
"204987124-0-79501";"You said someone stole a staff from Oathsworn Pit?"
"204987124-0-79502";"I'll see you later, then."
"204987124-0-79504";"Amaurel thought you could court her properly. No dowry."
"204987124-0-79505";"What does the rite do?"
"204987124-0-79507";"All right. I'll see you later then."
"204987124-0-79509";"The Echonir?"
"204987124-0-79510";"I don't think I've met you before."
"204987124-0-79511";"You're a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-79512";"Family business?"
"204987124-0-79513";"What exactly happened in Bedlam Veil?"
"204987124-0-79514";"What exactly happened in Bedlam Veil?"
"204987124-0-79515";"Why do we need to stop Torvesard from remembering Prince Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-79516";"Which vineyard?"
"204987124-0-79517";"Very well. Where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-79518";"What associates?"
"204987124-0-79519";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-79520";"The Emblem of the Last King?"
"204987124-0-79521";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-79528";"I know where there's some vineyards."
"204987124-0-79533";"Tell me more about the Garland Ring."
"204987124-0-79536";"You find the path, Ithelia shows you how to open the way, then I destroy the path with Abolisher."
"204987124-0-79537";"Where are Laeni and Clendagal?"
"204987124-0-79539";"I will. See you soon."
"204987124-0-79540";"Good to hear."
"204987124-0-79544";"You have a way to contact Hyacinth?"
"204987124-0-79545";"A hidden base in Toothmaul Gully?"
"204987124-0-79546";"Once you make the fluid, then what?"
"204987124-0-79547";"What did they want to know?"
"204987124-0-79548";"And who are the Ceythalmor?"
"204987124-0-79554";"All right. I'll tell Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-79556";"All right. I'll let you get to mixing."
"204987124-0-79558";"Only that you're members of a group called the Garland Ring."
"204987124-0-79560";"What do you want to do now?"
"204987124-0-79561";"All right, I'll look around."
"204987124-0-79562";"That you're all part of a spy ring."
"204987124-0-79563";"Sounds ambitious."
"204987124-0-79564";"You shouldn't put butter in a cup?"
"204987124-0-79566";"Are you the leader of the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-79567";"An islet home and something growing in a ring of loam?"
"204987124-0-79568";"Tell me about the Gardener."
"204987124-0-79576";"Thank you, Chirrabi."
"204987124-0-79580";"Can you tell me a bit about yourself?"
"204987124-0-79586";"So where's the third glyphic?"
"204987124-0-79587";"How could everyone forget a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-79588";"Tell me about Torvesard."
"204987124-0-79589";"I don't see any threads of fate."
"204987124-0-79590";"How could everyone forget a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-79591";"Why didn't you share the ability to see threads of fate before?"
"204987124-0-79592";"How could everyone forget a Daedric Prince?"
"204987124-0-79593";"Sure. What are you thinking?"
"204987124-0-79594";"I'll see you two outside the village then."
"204987124-0-79595";"What about a symbol for Laeni?"
"204987124-0-79596";"Was Axeborn Khurga important to you?"
"204987124-0-79597";"What is the Lodge of the Forge?"
"204987124-0-79598";"You seem upset."
"204987124-0-79599";"You seem upset."
"204987124-0-79603";"You're part Ayleid?"
"204987124-0-79604";"Oh. Don't let me stand in your way."
"204987124-0-79607";"Go right ahead, then."
"204987124-0-79608";"And this fatigue fever is blamed for all these deaths, including your father?"
"204987124-0-79609";"All right. Anyone in specific you think I should talk to?"
"204987124-0-79610";"Here. I found this in your father's desk."
"204987124-0-79612";"What are you thinking?"
"204987124-0-79614";"How are the arena challenges going?"
"204987124-0-79616";"A long journey ahead? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-79617";"Why would they have an issue with the Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-79618";"Could you tell me my fortune?"
"204987124-0-79619";"What is the Dawnway exactly?"
"204987124-0-79628";"Why study the Seeker's Archive?"
"204987124-0-79630";"All right, I'll come back later then."
"204987124-0-79631";"You incorporate what you learn into your card playing?"
"204987124-0-79633";"Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)"
"204987124-0-79644";"A Twilight Cantor sent me to search for a fallen star near Moonmont. A spirit cat led me here."
"204987124-0-79647";"You seem disappointed we need to destroy this equipment."
"204987124-0-79649";"What do the Good Daedra have to do with Torvesard's Forgotten Prince?"
"204987124-0-79650";"Should we go to Grahtwood next?"
"204987124-0-79651";"Sophists and mystics?"
"204987124-0-79652";"What's the debate about?"
"204987124-0-79654";"Very well. I'm ready to continue."
"204987124-0-79655";"Very well. I'm ready to continue."
"204987124-0-79656";"Very well. I'm ready to continue."
"204987124-0-79657";"Abibon-Gora. That's far from Skingrad."
"204987124-0-79658";"What's the Molag Bal Paradox?"
"204987124-0-79662";"Is there some way I can help?"
"204987124-0-79663";"I have some thoughts."
"204987124-0-79665";"What happens if the bell isn't rung in the proper sequence?"
"204987124-0-79666";"Tell me more about Legionary Calvo."
"204987124-0-79667";"Perhaps Molag Bal represents the clash of free will and fate, and is himself suffering."
"204987124-0-79668";"Perhaps."
"204987124-0-79669";"Good to hear."
"204987124-0-79670";"Perhaps."
"204987124-0-79671";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-79673";"You're a legionary?"
"204987124-0-79682";"Do you want to talk about the Molag Bal Paradox again?"
"204987124-0-79683";"What's the premise?"
"204987124-0-79684";"I have some thoughts."
"204987124-0-79685";"I have some thoughts."
"204987124-0-79686";"I have some thoughts."
"204987124-0-79688";"Perhaps Molag Bal represents the clash of free will and fate, and is himself suffering."
"204987124-0-79689";"Perhaps."
"204987124-0-79690";"Good to hear."
"204987124-0-79691";"Perhaps."
"204987124-0-79692";"Thanks."
"204987124-0-79695";"What dangers are you referring to?"
"204987124-0-79697";"What were the two of you doing in Vvardenfell?"
"204987124-0-79699";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-79700";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-79701";"You were lucky to make it out."
"204987124-0-79702";"Did you see what had called them here?"
"204987124-0-79703";"The baroness evacuated you?"
"204987124-0-79704";"Between your coin and your life, I think you made out with the best outcome possible."
"204987124-0-79705";"Could this cat spirit be a trick of some sort?"
"204987124-0-79718";"I found Zerith-var of the Hidden Moon while investigating that fallen star. He led me here."
"204987124-0-79719";"All right. We'll do what we can to help the other Twilight Cantors."
"204987124-0-79720";"Zerith says Azurah sent him here to deal with the Rajaska."
"204987124-0-79723";"Why do you suppose Constable Ulbren suspected a crime?"
"204987124-0-79725";"You spoke with Constable Ulbren before he died?"
"204987124-0-79727";"What's a tracker fly?"
"204987124-0-79729";"River lilies and silver dust. I could get those for you."
"204987124-0-79735";"I'm sure you did."
"204987124-0-79741";"Constable Ulbren was planning to talk to you. Any idea why?"
"204987124-0-79743";"Tell me about the quarry."
"204987124-0-79744";"Who's Baron Carvain?"
"204987124-0-79746";"Portal? He wants me to return to Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-79749";"Before I go, I have questions."
"204987124-0-79750";"What do you mean, you dare not interfere?"
"204987124-0-79753";"And you haven't figured out what Ithelia tried to show you before she departed?"
"204987124-0-79758";"Probably something like that."
"204987124-0-79760";"The connection?"
"204987124-0-79761";"I'll go talk to Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee."
"204987124-0-79762";"So, Beragon Sharp-Dagger?"
"204987124-0-79763";"Right. So what will you do next, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-79764";"What's next for you, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-79765";"What will you do next, Tribune Alea?"
"204987124-0-79766";"So, what's next for Curate Gadayn?"
"204987124-0-79767";"How did Ithelia escape?"
"204987124-0-79773";"What can we do to avoid destruction?"
"204987124-0-79774";"Fine. I'll talk to Leramil the Wise."
"204987124-0-79775";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"204987124-0-79776";"What do you think the Blind is after?"
"204987124-0-79777";"So you want the Wood Elves of Vashabar to stay?"
"204987124-0-79778";"How will you do that?"
"204987124-0-79780";"She's a knight that uses magic?"
"204987124-0-79782";"What happens next?"
"204987124-0-79783";"That's it? Just place the three relics in specific locations?"
"204987124-0-79785";"All right, I'll place the relics and cast the spell. Where do I need to go?"
"204987124-0-79786";"What about the wildburn?"
"204987124-0-79796";"Did you try to go through?"
"204987124-0-79797";"Can you tell where it leads?"
"204987124-0-79798";"Why is this place so important to the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-79799";"Why wouldn't you be available?"
"204987124-0-79800";"How did you get the rank of Tribune?"
"204987124-0-79805";"You said Valenwood crossed the river?"
"204987124-0-79806";"You don't have anyone else who could bless your wedding?"
"204987124-0-79808";"Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think."
"204987124-0-79810";"You said your families hate each other?"
"204987124-0-79812";"You said your families hate each other?"
"204987124-0-79813";"They don't approve of your marriage because of their views?"
"204987124-0-79815";"Why didn't you try to leave before today?"
"204987124-0-79816";"You're proud of Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-79817";"How were these buildings created?"
"204987124-0-79822";"What else should I know about Elenglynn?"
"204987124-0-79823";"Tell me more about the Echonir."
"204987124-0-79824";"This Lamp of Clarity opened the way. It's leading us to Sage's Dream ingredients."
"204987124-0-79826";"I'll get the harkfruit."
"204987124-0-79828";"The Lamp of Clarity led us to two ingredients. I think the final ingredient is here."
"204987124-0-79830";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-79842";"It sounded like the Blind knew you."
"204987124-0-79843";"What can you tell me about the Skyvault?"
"204987124-0-79845";"Thank you, Chirrabi."
"204987124-0-79847";"It's the year 582 of the Second Era."
"204987124-0-79848";"The Coldharbour Compact?"
"204987124-0-79849";"What are we supposed to do, then?"
"204987124-0-79850";"I've already been to a place you mentioned."
"204987124-0-79851";"There must be something else we can do, too."
"204987124-0-79852";"I have some questions, Zerith-var."
"204987124-0-79853";"I've never heard of the Order of the Hidden Moon. You're a necromancer?"
"204987124-0-79855";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-79857";"You said there was a shrine for your order here?"
"204987124-0-79858";"Why are you interested in Rustwall Estate?"
"204987124-0-79860";"What kind of secrets?"
"204987124-0-79861";"What happened to Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-79862";"Where can we find that sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-79863";"All right. Let's go find this entrance."
"204987124-0-79870";"I'll look around for the moonclaw and see what else I can find."
"204987124-0-79871";"Are you sensing the Echonir?"
"204987124-0-79873";"Very well."
"204987124-0-79874";"What did the Echonir show you?"
"204987124-0-79875";"How will things be interesting?"
"204987124-0-79876";"You're familiar with this place?"
"204987124-0-79878";"You think the Ceythalmor have captured Snapdragon?"
"204987124-0-79886";"Then let's head to Deepwoods."
"204987124-0-79887";"You called this place the Scholarium? Where are we?"
"204987124-0-79888";"I want to help, just tell me what to do."
"204987124-0-79889";"Have to try what?"
"204987124-0-79892";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-79893";"I'll examine the prayer book."
"204987124-0-79895";"And that's what I just did, Scribing? Shaping magic?"
"204987124-0-79897";"And I can Scribe more grimoires, shape new skills?"
"204987124-0-79898";"What do we do next?"
"204987124-0-79901";"How do we find the Rajaska?"
"204987124-0-79902";"Is there a way you can teach the Twilight Cantors your way of doing things?"
"204987124-0-79906";"We came to restore your moonclaw. How can we do that if the Temple of Dark Moons no longer exists?"
"204987124-0-79907";"She's one of the Twilight Cantors. Cantor Krin'ze works with her."
"204987124-0-79909";"I found this black pearl inside that ruined altar. Can it help to restore your moonclaw?"
"204987124-0-79914";"Is there anything unusual about either Lord or Lady Valente?"
"204987124-0-79916";"Let's go find a way into the keep."
"204987124-0-79917";"Dragged them where?"
"204987124-0-79918";"I'll help you."
"204987124-0-79923";"Could the Blind be looking for something within the Hall of Barons?"
"204987124-0-79924";"Never mind. What if I gave you a little gold for a little silver dust?"
"204987124-0-79925";"Never mind. What if I gave you a little gold for a little silver dust?"
"204987124-0-79928";"What's the Hall of Barons?"
"204987124-0-79929";"Why was that?"
"204987124-0-79930";"What sort of weapons are stored here?"
"204987124-0-79931";"So you're going to stick around?"
"204987124-0-79932";"Can't we just pick the lock to the vault?"
"204987124-0-79934";"How do you know about the spare vault key?"
"204987124-0-79936";"What do you know about the Blind Path?"
"204987124-0-79937";"Why would you get involved with cultists?"
"204987124-0-79938";"And you want me to be this inheritor?"
"204987124-0-79939";"Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-79946";"You're going to make the Jubilee Cake now?"
"204987124-0-79947";"Has the Recollection been around long?"
"204987124-0-79948";"What is the Recollection doing?"
"204987124-0-79949";"This house is enormous. It's all yours?"
"204987124-0-79951";"Hmm."
"204987124-0-79954";"Why come here?"
"204987124-0-79955";"You suspect a tie between the Wood Elves of Vashabar and the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-79956";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-79957";"This house is enormous. It's all yours?"
"204987124-0-79966";"That's good to know."
"204987124-0-79967";"Is there anything else I need to know?"
"204987124-0-79969";"I'll see you in Auridon, then."
"204987124-0-79971";"What's it?"
"204987124-0-79975";"All right, we'll travel to the Ritual Mundus Stone in Malabal Tor."
"204987124-0-79976";"What am I looking for?"
"204987124-0-79978";"Only a fragment of the key?"
"204987124-0-79980";"Let's go question the imposter Uriel."
"204987124-0-79981";"Where exactly did you see this covered cart?"
"204987124-0-79982";"Where does Lady Weatherleah take her tea?"
"204987124-0-79983";"How did you grow this forest so quickly?"
"204987124-0-79985";"Tribune Alea thinks some of your people might be part of the Recollection."
"204987124-0-79986";"What then?"
"204987124-0-79987";"See you there."
"204987124-0-79989";"Where should we go to check on Snapdragon?"
"204987124-0-80006";"I've tasted Chef Donolon's Jubilee Cake."
"204987124-0-80007";"Why not ask one of your colleagues to enter the portal with you? Why seek me out?"
"204987124-0-80008";"Why do you think the portal needs more than one person to grant entry?"
"204987124-0-80011";"Why would I do that?"
"204987124-0-80012";"Where do they come from?"
"204987124-0-80013";"Why was the island lost?"
"204987124-0-80015";"What more can you tell me about Ulfsild?"
"204987124-0-80016";"What do you mean? They knew they wouldn't be together forever?"
"204987124-0-80017";"What happened to Archmage Shalidor?"
"204987124-0-80021";"Is Sunhold that terrible?"
"204987124-0-80024";"All right, let's get in touch with Hyacinth."
"204987124-0-80027";"Why ask to speak to me? Shouldn't you tell this to the Gardener?"
"204987124-0-80030";"Do you know who this traitor is?"
"204987124-0-80033";"Do you think you'll ever be able to forgive the Gardener?"
"204987124-0-80036";"Yes, absolutely."
"204987124-0-80040";"How did you get all these Elves to follow you?"
"204987124-0-80046";"How will that open your door?"
"204987124-0-80047";"Are you really a king?"
"204987124-0-80048";"You called Beragon the hero of Ninglenirre Pass?"
"204987124-0-80052";"Does it matter which tasks I complete?"
"204987124-0-80054";"I'll return when the challenges are done."
"204987124-0-80061";"Tanlorin thought you might have some suggestions."
"204987124-0-80063";"All right, we'll meet you on the beach."
"204987124-0-80065";"Why would you get involved with cultists?"
"204987124-0-80066";"Understood."
"204987124-0-80067";"What did you do?"
"204987124-0-80068";"So what do you suggest?"
"204987124-0-80069";"Saving the fawn was a mistake?"
"204987124-0-80071";"All right. I'll accompany you and Leramil to examine this instability."
"204987124-0-80072";"Where should I start?"
"204987124-0-80073";"You didn't know Lord Gallio Valente was a vampire?"
"204987124-0-80075";"I need to get this information to Fennorian."
"204987124-0-80076";"Maybe you should explain this plan of yours to me in simple terms."
"204987124-0-80078";"Connections? How will that help us get to Sunhold?"
"204987124-0-80080";"All right. I'll keep my eyes open."
"204987124-0-80081";"How do you study goblins?"
"204987124-0-80082";"How are we going to be able to stop the Goblin war without disturbing them?"
"204987124-0-80083";"What do you expect to find at the Bitterfish camp?"
"204987124-0-80084";"What does that mean for my Scribing?"
"204987124-0-80085";"And what's your role exactly?"
"204987124-0-80086";"What sort of demands?"
"204987124-0-80087";"You think this is your fault?"
"204987124-0-80088";"Nahlia has returned from the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-80089";"I accept this gift, Indrik."
"204987124-0-80092";"Tell me about High Cantor Viti."
"204987124-0-80093";"You mentioned the spirit of a little cat?"
"204987124-0-80096";"Does that mean you'll be staying here in the Scholarium?"
"204987124-0-80097";"Tanlorin is capable in their own right. They've been supporting me."
"204987124-0-80098";"I'll be careful."
"204987124-0-80100";"You want us to determine who the traitor is?"
"204987124-0-80103";"I'm committed, Nahlia. Let's get to it."
"204987124-0-80105";"I'm with you, Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-80106";"Land that doesn't belong to them?"
"204987124-0-80107";"So you're concerned about the count's claim to that land?"
"204987124-0-80108";"Were you able to convince Count Calantius to send more legionaries to Rustwall Estate?"
"204987124-0-80109";"How have you fared since we last met?"
"204987124-0-80110";"I can't say that I have. Are these published books?"
"204987124-0-80111";"Sounds dangerous."
"204987124-0-80112";"Why does the ritual need to be stopped?"
"204987124-0-80113";"How can we stop the ritual?"
"204987124-0-80114";"How can we stop the ritual?"
"204987124-0-80118";"He certainly keeps busy."
"204987124-0-80119";"Where do you fit in with this?"
"204987124-0-80120";"All right. I'll look around for your moonclaw. We can talk when I return."
"204987124-0-80122";"You're quite involved."
"204987124-0-80125";"I have some questions, Zerith-var."
"204987124-0-80126";"The tablet said you died fighting Rajaska. Did you really die?"
"204987124-0-80128";"What are Rajaska, exactly?"
"204987124-0-80129";"And you died fighting a Rajaska? Do you remember what happened, exactly?"
"204987124-0-80130";"What can you tell me about the town of Sutch?"
"204987124-0-80131";"What can you tell me about the town of Sutch?"
"204987124-0-80132";"Do you know how we can calm these Goblins down?"
"204987124-0-80133";"Let's go to the Sharp Tooth camp."
"204987124-0-80137";"The traitor to the Garland Ring. What do we know?"
"204987124-0-80138";"How did her husband die?"
"204987124-0-80147";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-80148";"Of course, Snapdragon."
"204987124-0-80150";"I'll meet you there."
"204987124-0-80153";"Rest easy, Snapdragon."
"204987124-0-80155";"You aren't coming with me?"
"204987124-0-80158";"What do the Goblin totems look like?"
"204987124-0-80163";"You'd write about this?"
"204987124-0-80164";"Do you think the farmers can learn to live with the Goblins?"
"204987124-0-80166";"Yes, I'll go with you to the Temple of the Dark Moon."
"204987124-0-80167";"What's that?"
"204987124-0-80173";"Why do I need to investigate the Outcast Inn?"
"204987124-0-80179";"Remind me. What's happening in West Weald?"
"204987124-0-80180";"Tell me more about this forgotten Daedric Prince."
"204987124-0-80183";"See if that pearl restores your moonclaw first."
"204987124-0-80184";"So there's a moment on the disk? How can we view it?"
"204987124-0-80186";"Let's give it a try."
"204987124-0-80189";"How do we get through the Recollection defenses?"
"204987124-0-80191";"Why do you think that?"
"204987124-0-80193";"Tamiit. What does that word mean?"
"204987124-0-80198";"The Bent Dance?"
"204987124-0-80199";"But we don't have the Skein of Secrets."
"204987124-0-80207";"Why is the Recollection seeking the relics now?"
"204987124-0-80208";"You think we can use the relics against Ithelia and her servants?"
"204987124-0-80209";"But Ithelia saw different reflections of herself when we traveled the Many Paths, Scruut."
"204987124-0-80210";"What about the Lamp of Clarity?"
"204987124-0-80211";"And what does the Skein do?"
"204987124-0-80212";"You're not coming to Niryastare?"
"204987124-0-80213";"How did you learn about Ayleid puzzles?"
"204987124-0-80214";"What became of your company?"
"204987124-0-80215";"I met your niece in the city."
"204987124-0-80216";"You could go to the Outcast Inn."
"204987124-0-80226";"Have you asked the Crow?"
"204987124-0-80227";"Why do you say the Goblins are angry?"
"204987124-0-80231";"If warring Goblins are so dangerous, why not let the hunter handle it?"
"204987124-0-80232";"I'll help you find a way to calm the warring Goblins."
"204987124-0-80234";"If you thought Bella was missing, why not form a search party?"
"204987124-0-80239";"I'll place the items."
"204987124-0-80241";"Why was she torturing you?"
"204987124-0-80243";"Where's the real journal hidden?"
"204987124-0-80244";"How did Hyacinth capture that moment on the disk?"
"204987124-0-80246";"So you're willing to lose Tanlorin over this crusade of yours?"
"204987124-0-80248";"Do you want to take her up on her offer?"
"204987124-0-80250";"Right. We'll figure this out. Together."
"204987124-0-80251";"Then what is the knife doing here?"
"204987124-0-80256";"I can ask Pim about the knife. Maybe she knows."
"204987124-0-80259";"Bella said that knife belonged to her family."
"204987124-0-80261";"How do you know?"
"204987124-0-80269";"What can you tell us about the vampires?"
"204987124-0-80272";"Couldn't it be one of the other items?"
"204987124-0-80273";"What did those other bakers do?"
"204987124-0-80275";"I can fling some pies and recover your ingredients."
"204987124-0-80276";"As you wish."
"204987124-0-80277";"Have you heard from Hyacinth or the Gardener?"
"204987124-0-80280";"An echo about the Dragon? Where did you find it?"
"204987124-0-80282";"I'm good for it."
"204987124-0-80286";"Where do I start?"
"204987124-0-80287";"I'll give it a try."
"204987124-0-80289";"Another purpose?"
"204987124-0-80290";"Why am I starting with the Indrik?"
"204987124-0-80291";"How did you learn about Ayleid puzzles?"
"204987124-0-80292";"What's the Darkened Home? What power sleeps there?"
"204987124-0-80294";"I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar."
"204987124-0-80318";"I'll look for the echo in the east wing, then."
"204987124-0-80319";"What happens then?"
"204987124-0-80322";"Oil barricade, set barricade on fire, launch ballista bolts at Daedra. Got it."
"204987124-0-80326";"The winery and the alchemical laboratory are downstairs. I found the key."
"204987124-0-80327";"You've kissed people at a castle?"
"204987124-0-80328";"Let's make our way to Monkey's Rest."
"204987124-0-80342";"Tell me about Big Urm."
"204987124-0-80343";"What about Fallen-Knives?"
"204987124-0-80344";"What were you going to say?"
"204987124-0-80345";"Tell me about Big Urm."
"204987124-0-80346";"What about Fallen-Knives?"
"204987124-0-80348";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-80349";"So you deserted?"
"204987124-0-80350";"Why draw that line?"
"204987124-0-80351";"Tell me more about the three Scarlets I'm looking for."
"204987124-0-80353";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-80362";"You won't leave without your ring?"
"204987124-0-80364";"You'll go meet Hooke? He's waiting in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge."
"204987124-0-80365";"So, you'll meet Hooke? He wants you to go to the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge."
"204987124-0-80370";"We're pretty close to Valenwood, aren't we?"
"204987124-0-80371";"Why are you having me do these particular challenges?"
"204987124-0-80372";"And these challenges all relate to power?"
"204987124-0-80373";"If it's so simple why is Scribing a lost art?"
"204987124-0-80374";"You chose your form. Why are you an Indrik?"
"204987124-0-80376";"Why did you lend your power to the fawn?"
"204987124-0-80377";"After what happened?"
"204987124-0-80378";"All right. I'm ready to go."
"204987124-0-80380";"It didn't work out that way?"
"204987124-0-80382";"If I deal with your tab, would you go to the Outlaws Refuge in Skingrad?"
"204987124-0-80384";"This should cover it."
"204987124-0-80386";"Hooke's waiting for you in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge."
"204987124-0-80388";"Hooke's waiting for you in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge."
"204987124-0-80394";"[Warn Narsis] Narsis, wait!"
"204987124-0-80396";"Tell me about this note."
"204987124-0-80399";"What's the difference between a tribune and a captain?"
"204987124-0-80400";"So you'll meet with Hooke?"
"204987124-0-80402";"I'll see you in the Outlaws Refuge of Skingrad, then."
"204987124-0-80406";"Noraine? Your granddaughter?"
"204987124-0-80408";"I see."
"204987124-0-80409";"Someone other than the four of you?"
"204987124-0-80410";"What were you doing for the expedition?"
"204987124-0-80411";"She said you would know what happened here."
"204987124-0-80412";"What's the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-80413";"You don't know if the null arca works?"
"204987124-0-80414";"What's the null arca?"
"204987124-0-80415";"<Enter Lucent Citadel.>"
"204987124-0-80420";"Who is Xoryn?"
"204987124-0-80421";"It sounds like you have something personal against him."
"204987124-0-80422";"What's the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-80424";"Where is he?"
"204987124-0-80426";"You want me to find Naku and convince him to come?"
"204987124-0-80427";"And then you deserted."
"204987124-0-80428";"So you stole to survive?"
"204987124-0-80429";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-80430";"And then what happened?"
"204987124-0-80431";"Valenia told me what happened the night before the fire."
"204987124-0-80432";"But you escaped."
"204987124-0-80433";"How are you involved in the Legion?"
"204987124-0-80447";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-80456";"Naku called him Marcan. He killed Naku with this knife."
"204987124-0-80457";"Who do you think survived?"
"204987124-0-80459";"What do you think we'll find there?"
"204987124-0-80468";"Then let's go talk to Scruut!"
"204987124-0-80473";"Can you tell me more about the seedpods?"
"204987124-0-80474";"Why won't you need it anymore?"
"204987124-0-80477";"Restored?"
"204987124-0-80479";"All right. Let's head into the auction."
"204987124-0-80482";"Then what happened?"
"204987124-0-80483";"You mentioned something about Wood Elves?"
"204987124-0-80484";"Why would Pelena run you out?"
"204987124-0-80485";"A memorial to Uriel?"
"204987124-0-80486";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-80489";"What led up to everyone fleeing to the catacombs to hide?"
"204987124-0-80490";"Let's go to Gray's Hollow then."
"204987124-0-80491";"Captain Dartorius said she led the Daedra away after you attacked her."
"204987124-0-80492";"I can take your report to the captain."
"204987124-0-80495";"Do you think the ground shaking and the wildburn seed are connected?"
"204987124-0-80497";"Any idea why she came to Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-80511";"All right, I'll look for Lord Valente's office inside the manor."
"204987124-0-80512";"How does Ursilia know you?"
"204987124-0-80513";"How did you get turned into a vampire?"
"204987124-0-80515";"Are you going to honor her request?"
"204987124-0-80518";"She never knew what happened to you?"
"204987124-0-80519";"She never knew what happened to you?"
"204987124-0-80529";"All right, but why these locations specifically?"
"204987124-0-80531";"So whatever we do at these spots will likewise resonate and repair the entire fabric?"
"204987124-0-80532";"Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?"
"204987124-0-80534";"You're all-knowing. Why did this outcome surprise you?"
"204987124-0-80535";"What will happen to Ithelia's minions now?"
"204987124-0-80536";"Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?"
"204987124-0-80537";"Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?"
"204987124-0-80541";"What's the plan?"
"204987124-0-80544";"What should I know about Lord Gallio Valente?"
"204987124-0-80545";"What can you tell us about the auction?"
"204987124-0-80546";"You mentioned a new kind of grape?"
"204987124-0-80548";"Understood. I'll ask around and see what I can learn."
"204987124-0-80549";"I'll see what we can do."
"204987124-0-80551";"Can you help me? I'm looking for a scroll called the Rite of Propagation?"
"204987124-0-80552";"What is the Wilderhall?"
"204987124-0-80554";"The One Who Knows?"
"204987124-0-80555";"Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-80556";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-80557";"Why are we responsible for ending this threat?"
"204987124-0-80558";"What sorts of dreams?"
"204987124-0-80560";"Preparing this season's Jubilee Cake sounds like quite an honor."
"204987124-0-80561";"Have you made a Jubilee Cake before?"
"204987124-0-80562";"Why is it called the Outcast Inn?"
"204987124-0-80564";"What do you think the Recollection's looking for?"
"204987124-0-80565";"Did Tribune Alea tell you what she was doing at Feldagard Keep?"
"204987124-0-80568";"I'll help you look into the Recollection's plans. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-80572";"I suppose, what's your favorite thing about the Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-80573";"Blade dancer?"
"204987124-0-80574";"Do you have a special connection to Laeni and Clendagal?"
"204987124-0-80575";"And once we're inside?"
"204987124-0-80576";"Didn't High Cantor Viti tell the Inquisitors what we did at the Vile Manse?"
"204987124-0-80578";"How long have you been Chef Donolon's apprentice?"
"204987124-0-80581";"Thanks for the information."
"204987124-0-80583";"Tanlorin has a plan. We need your help."
"204987124-0-80584";"He's not, but that's beside the point. What about Cantor Izalgo? Where is he?"
"204987124-0-80586";"We'll stop Wisteria. Just listen to Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-80587";"Did Chef Donolon adopt you after that?"
"204987124-0-80588";"No, but we found his journal at Goldfolly. The inquisitors with him didn't make it."
"204987124-0-80589";"How did Ravith fall to the Bent Dance?"
"204987124-0-80591";"I did try to warn him about rushing into things."
"204987124-0-80594";"Tell me more about Chef Donolon's culinary journey."
"204987124-0-80598";"A letter I found suggested the next wildburn will awaken wellsprings of power, whatever that means."
"204987124-0-80599";"And why's that?"
"204987124-0-80609";"And Haldain Lumber Camp is in this devastated region?"
"204987124-0-80610";"The devastated area has affected the wildlife. Altered creatures attacked the camp."
"204987124-0-80615";"Tell me what you do remember about yourself."
"204987124-0-80616";"Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?"
"204987124-0-80624";"You think Tham is going to stay a vampire?"
"204987124-0-80626";"But they were responsible for Dawnwood and the Wildburn."
"204987124-0-80627";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-80631";"Have you set a date for the wedding yet?"
"204987124-0-80634";"Any word from Leramil the Wise?"
"204987124-0-80635";"Shouldn't the Skein of Secrets show us where Ithelia is?"
"204987124-0-80636";"Why is Nantharion doing all this?"
"204987124-0-80637";"You won't keep researching Goblins?"
"204987124-0-80639";"The Garland Ring tries to do what's best for the people of Summerset."
"204987124-0-80641";"You're welcome, your majesty."
"204987124-0-80642";"Do the Twlight Cantors have any record of such a song?"
"204987124-0-80645";"Do you know of any caves near Willowgrove?"
"204987124-0-80646";"Ulfsild's notes came up with an answer."
"204987124-0-80647";"So Moon-Singer Talbira possessed you?"
"204987124-0-80648";"I want to take your trial, Dragon."
"204987124-0-80649";"I'll place the fable on the dais."
"204987124-0-80650";"What do you want me to do for your trial?"
"204987124-0-80651";"Understood. I'll solve some of your riddles."
"204987124-0-80654";"What do you think about the Riddle of Battle?"
"204987124-0-80655";"Thank you, Llaren."
"204987124-0-80656";"Thank you, Julian."
"204987124-0-80657";"Thank you, Irnard."
"204987124-0-80658";"Thank you, Crow."
"204987124-0-80661";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-80662";"What kind of a riddle?"
"204987124-0-80663";"I'll speak to Nahlia and the Crow, then."
"204987124-0-80664";"How can I understand how you think?"
"204987124-0-80665";"What was Mizbi's riddle?"
"204987124-0-80666";"Maybe we could learn from Mizbi's riddle."
"204987124-0-80667";"That's good to hear. Where are the notes?"
"204987124-0-80670";"All right."
"204987124-0-80672";"You want to speak with Moon-Singer Talbira's spirit?"
"204987124-0-80673";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-80675";"Well all right then."
"204987124-0-80676";"A lesson."
"204987124-0-80677";"Could what be that simple?"
"204987124-0-80678";"The Dragon said I needed to understand her mind. You don't think she'll be able to work that out?"
"204987124-0-80679";"So am I or am I not?"
"204987124-0-80680";"Clever. Does that mean you accept my riddle?"
"204987124-0-80681";"Another wing taken care of."
"204987124-0-80684";"I already found and delivered the creatures."
"204987124-0-80686";"Take care."
"204987124-0-80687";"So what now?"
"204987124-0-80688";"You were fine with marrying someone you didn't love or who didn't love you?"
"204987124-0-80689";"Would you have gone through with the marriage if you knew he was a vampire?"
"204987124-0-80690";"Is that all marriage is to you, a business opportunity?"
"204987124-0-80695";"Thank you, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-80700";"Good idea, I'll talk to the Crow."
"204987124-0-80701";"I'll speak to Nahlia."
"204987124-0-80702";"I see."
"204987124-0-80703";"All right. Thank you Nahlia."
"204987124-0-80704";"Thank you, Dragon."
"204987124-0-80707";"How should I find the real fable?"
"204987124-0-80708";"All right. I'll start there."
"204987124-0-80709";"What's going on?"
"204987124-0-80710";"What's going on?"
"204987124-0-80711";"What's going on?"
"204987124-0-80715";"So you think we should flatter the Netch? How can we do that?"
"204987124-0-80716";"Go right ahead."
"204987124-0-80718";"Eveli never mentioned you were her brother."
"204987124-0-80726";"You said your family and Clendagal's hate each other?"
"204987124-0-80730";"Ulfsild's notes said it was a cave."
"204987124-0-80733";"All right. Where do we start?"
"204987124-0-80734";"I'll place the fable."
"204987124-0-80736";"What kind of help do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-80737";"I'll read your list, then."
"204987124-0-80738";"Where can I find the list?"
"204987124-0-80745";"I'm going to help him resolve these regrets?"
"204987124-0-80747";"Why not?"
"204987124-0-80748";"And you're going to help me with portals."
"204987124-0-80749";"What did it say?"
"204987124-0-80750";"What did you say to him?"
"204987124-0-80751";"What did it say?"
"204987124-0-80752";"Say what you want to say while there's still time."
"204987124-0-80753";"Why do we need to stop Torvesard from remembering Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-80754";"I'll head into the cave and have a look."
"204987124-0-80755";"Light enough to have that conversation."
"204987124-0-80756";"Maybe. Why do you think the Netch drew you into its trial?"
"204987124-0-80759";"Very well. Where do we begin?"
"204987124-0-80767";"Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?"
"204987124-0-80768";"Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?"
"204987124-0-80769";"Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?"
"204987124-0-80770";"Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?"
"204987124-0-80771";"I'll talk to Nahlia, then."
"204987124-0-80775";"Ulrath and all your legionaries were dead. I found this report he wrote before he died."
"204987124-0-80777";"Is there anything that can be done?"
"204987124-0-80780";"And why did Ulrath attack you?"
"204987124-0-80781";"I'm ready. Good luck, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-80782";"The ink will connect you to the soul fragments?"
"204987124-0-80784";"He was supposed to be promoted?"
"204987124-0-80785";"He's with you right now in Suran."
"204987124-0-80787";"Then return to Suran. You can still reach him."
"204987124-0-80789";"Tell me about the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-80790";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80791";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80792";"What's the Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-80793";"Tell me about the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-80794";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80795";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80796";"What's the Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-80798";"It's not too late. Elic is waiting for you in Suran."
"204987124-0-80799";"Tell me about the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-80800";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80801";"Which side do you agree with?"
"204987124-0-80802";"Tell me about the Green Pact."
"204987124-0-80804";"You and Ithelia were going to change history!"
"204987124-0-80805";"What can you tell me about this inn?"
"204987124-0-80807";"I can't let Ithelia destroy reality."
"204987124-0-80809";"You're welcome."
"204987124-0-80810";"I'll try, Netch. Thank you."
"204987124-0-80811";"Have I earned your respect? Your support for my Scribing journey?"
"204987124-0-80814";"Curate Gadayn is fine. He can't wait to see you."
"204987124-0-80819";"Interesting."
"204987124-0-80820";"Interesting."
"204987124-0-80821";"Interesting."
"204987124-0-80822";"She said it was time to go home. And something about a loom and restoring what was lost."
"204987124-0-80825";"You're committed to the Dawnway, then?"
"204987124-0-80826";"You mentioned you're a blade dancer?"
"204987124-0-80829";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-80834";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-80835";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-80836";"Even if I dispel the wards, do you really think I'll find a clue to the next set?"
"204987124-0-80839";"Where is she?"
"204987124-0-80840";"I'll go speak to Nahlia."
"204987124-0-80845";"The knot can connect two realities?"
"204987124-0-80846";"What happened to the other expeditions?"
"204987124-0-80847";"Why do you think your expedition will succeed?"
"204987124-0-80848";"What happened to the other expeditions?"
"204987124-0-80849";"What about the claw and the tooth-marked plank?"
"204987124-0-80850";"Why do cartographers want the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-80853";"How do I lead him back?"
"204987124-0-80855";"Tell me about this bear."
"204987124-0-80857";"I'll look for the rite in the Wilderhall. Thank you, Spinner Belwelas."
"204987124-0-80858";"At an abandoned camp southwest of Pa'alat."
"204987124-0-80861";"What about Moon-Singer Talbira's spirit?"
"204987124-0-80862";"Why haven't Laeni and Clendagal already performed the rite?"
"204987124-0-80863";"What is it that you do in Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-80864";"What is it that you do in Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-80865";"What is it that you do in Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-80866";"What did she say?"
"204987124-0-80868";"Did you see this Twilight Cantor yourself?"
"204987124-0-80870";"Thanks for the warning."
"204987124-0-80871";"What was she angry about?"
"204987124-0-80874";"Why don't you return to Skingrad and heal up? I'll find the cub."
"204987124-0-80875";"Tell me about this bear."
"204987124-0-80876";"Sounds adorable."
"204987124-0-80877";"How did you get your injuries?"
"204987124-0-80880";"What is the Arcane Knot?"
"204987124-0-80881";"What is the Arcane Knot?"
"204987124-0-80882";"If these invitations are for the count, why were the crates sent to Fort Colovia?"
"204987124-0-80883";"What sort of information?"
"204987124-0-80884";"Let me see what Zerith thinks about all this."
"204987124-0-80887";"Do you know what Xoryn wants with the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-80888";"You're proud of the village but you still want to leave?"
"204987124-0-80889";"Is today the first time you spoke of leaving?"
"204987124-0-80890";"What is the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-80891";"Orcrest is a dangerous place, overrun with plague and monsters."
"204987124-0-80894";"The Scholarium is underneath this sanctuary?"
"204987124-0-80895";"Her notes are already visible without the lens?"
"204987124-0-80900";"Is there anything I can do to help?"
"204987124-0-80901";"Nahlia and I are working with the Luminaries to restore the Scholarium."
"204987124-0-80902";"All right, let's see it then."
"204987124-0-80903";"You'll give me back the pages for the fable?"
"204987124-0-80906";"Can I ask you some questions?"
"204987124-0-80907";"I will gather the flowers for you."
"204987124-0-80908";"Who's going to rule Vashabar now?"
"204987124-0-80909";"Your primary self is looking for you."
"204987124-0-80913";"What can I do to help?"
"204987124-0-80915";"I'm sorry, Leramil. There was nothing I could do."
"204987124-0-80919";"You said you had reports of more Shardborn incursions?"
"204987124-0-80920";"Shouldn't we try to defend West Weald from these incursions?"
"204987124-0-80921";"If you say so, Scruut."
"204987124-0-80923";"Withs King Nantharion's death, what happens to Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-80926";"What do you mean that your power abandoned you?"
"204987124-0-80928";"Let's look for that trail."
"204987124-0-80929";"What else can you tell me about these instabilities?"
"204987124-0-80930";"The energy in the relics has been depleted. What possible purpose could they still have?"
"204987124-0-80932";"You want me to ask Nahlia for her help?"
"204987124-0-80936";"Did you hide another page from the fable here?"
"204987124-0-80938";"I'll go down and look, then."
"204987124-0-80939";"I should be able to find the Gryphon's door then."
"204987124-0-80940";"I'll see you in the Wing of the Gryphon, then."
"204987124-0-80942";"Why did she freeze him?"
"204987124-0-80943";"I'll dispel the ward and free the Gryphon, then."
"204987124-0-80944";"What can I do?"
"204987124-0-80945";"I'm actually working with the spirit of Shalidor to restore Eyevea."
"204987124-0-80946";"I'll place the fable and open the door."
"204987124-0-80947";"I just want to restore the Scholarium and master Scribing."
"204987124-0-80948";"You want me to protect people?"
"204987124-0-80950";"I'll complete some of your safeguard tasks and return, Gryphon."
"204987124-0-80959";"What can I expect in the sunken ruins?"
"204987124-0-80960";"Why don't you go up to the lights?"
"204987124-0-80961";"How do we get the knot to the null arca?"
"204987124-0-80962";"Do you trust the Scribes of Mora?"
"204987124-0-80963";"So the threat here is over?"
"204987124-0-80964";"All right. I'll get you some West Weald Wallop."
"204987124-0-80965";"All right. I'll look for your next facet."
"204987124-0-80966";"That was someone else. The Belienne I spoke with wants to help you."
"204987124-0-80967";"Why is it so dangerous?"
"204987124-0-80968";"What should we do?"
"204987124-0-80969";"So the threat here is over?"
"204987124-0-80970";"Why did the Elves imprison you?"
"204987124-0-80971";"The others helped restore you. Without her, you won't be whole."
"204987124-0-80972";"And what happens to Rustwall Estate after that?"
"204987124-0-80974";"What would you have done if it didn't work?"
"204987124-0-80976";"Where do I get the ingredients?"
"204987124-0-80980";"What caused your personality to split?"
"204987124-0-80981";"Why were you experimenting with Daedric magic?"
"204987124-0-80982";"What caused your personality to split?"
"204987124-0-80983";"What caused your personality to split?"
"204987124-0-80984";"What's going on here, Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-80985";"How will I know what the arcane knot looks like?"
"204987124-0-80986";"Are you talking about protecting the Scholarium?"
"204987124-0-80987";"I'll talk to the Fox, then."
"204987124-0-80988";"Where are we going to borrow this magic from?"
"204987124-0-80991";"Fine, but how do they work?"
"204987124-0-80992";"What are you hoping will happen?"
"204987124-0-80994";"Why don't you go up to the lights?"
"204987124-0-80996";"Yes, here you go."
"204987124-0-80997";"Yes, here you go."
"204987124-0-80998";"Let's find Greenspeaker Sorilen and investigate this seed."
"204987124-0-80999";"How are we going to do that?"
"204987124-0-81000";"I see. Where are these thin connections you mentioned?"
"204987124-0-81001";"Why are we sneaking into these realms?"
"204987124-0-81002";"And you control the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-81003";"What's strange about a mortal entering the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-81004";"Can you describe the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-81005";"What do you mean intentionally so?"
"204987124-0-81006";"Can you describe the Many Paths?"
"204987124-0-81007";"Can you tell me anything about the Ithelia from my reality?"
"204987124-0-81008";"Help me understand the Lamp of Clarity's purpose."
"204987124-0-81010";"Why would you agree to be imprisoned for something you haven't done yet?"
"204987124-0-81011";"Can I ask you about the Many Paths."
"204987124-0-81012";"What brought you to this point?"
"204987124-0-81013";"What happens now for you and your followers?"
"204987124-0-81015";"So I just need to use the lens to find the creatia?"
"204987124-0-81022";"I'll watch my step."
"204987124-0-81025";"Is there anything else you can tell me about the Lucent Citadel?"
"204987124-0-81026";"Is there anything else you can tell me about the Lucent Citadel?"
"204987124-0-81029";"Are you a Scribe of Mora?"
"204987124-0-81034";"So I need to find the key, find the chest, and steal the creatia."
"204987124-0-81036";"I think I can manage that."
"204987124-0-81037";"How do I get the creatia?"
"204987124-0-81039";"All right, let's get in there."
"204987124-0-81040";"You'll support my journey to explore Scribing, then?"
"204987124-0-81042";"Thank you, Gryphon."
"204987124-0-81043";"Thank you, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81051";"I have some questions."
"204987124-0-81054";"I'll look for your fear southwest of Ontus."
"204987124-0-81055";"I have some questions about your facets."
"204987124-0-81056";"If you think Bella is missing, why not form a search party?"
"204987124-0-81057";"And then the ground shook?"
"204987124-0-81062";"She understands you like no one else can."
"204987124-0-81064";"All right. I'll look for your vanity in Dawnwood."
"204987124-0-81068";"Can I ask you some questions?"
"204987124-0-81071";"This man says you turned his wife into a pig."
"204987124-0-81076";"Is that where we can find Ravith-morna? Where is it?"
"204987124-0-81077";"Isn't that the reason Azurah sent you back?"
"204987124-0-81080";"Ithelia didn't just surrender. She agreed to give up her power and leave this reality."
"204987124-0-81082";"What is the null arca?"
"204987124-0-81083";"Did you say there are bears in the passage?"
"204987124-0-81091";"The count and the greenspeaker want to talk to me?"
"204987124-0-81093";"All right. I'll talk to Count Calantius and Greenspeaker Darolith."
"204987124-0-81096";"Where are Beragon and Tribune Alea, then?"
"204987124-0-81097";"You've got a different answer now?"
"204987124-0-81098";"Will your people listen to you?"
"204987124-0-81099";"Scruut can be a bit dramatic but basically, yes. Oh, I meant to ask you about Ninglenirre Pass."
"204987124-0-81101";"Can you tell me more about Eyevea?"
"204987124-0-81102";"What should we do with the items from the ritual?"
"204987124-0-81103";"Of course, here they are."
"204987124-0-81106";"How did you get the rank of Tribune?"
"204987124-0-81107";"How did you get the rank of Tribune?"
"204987124-0-81108";"What do you know about the attacking forces?"
"204987124-0-81109";"How are you involved with the Legion?"
"204987124-0-81110";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-81115";"So you're with me?"
"204987124-0-81117";"Do you know what ritual she was talking about?"
"204987124-0-81120";"No, what happened to Ithelia? She seemed hurt when I destroyed the Loom, then she changed."
"204987124-0-81122";"Like the version I saw of Ithelia when I traveled the Many Paths at the Outcast Inn."
"204987124-0-81125";"I vow to be charitable in what lies ahead."
"204987124-0-81129";"I vow to be loyal to others to the end of my days."
"204987124-0-81133";"I vow to protect those I care about."
"204987124-0-81137";"I'm ready. What do I do?"
"204987124-0-81138";"I'll get started, then."
"204987124-0-81139";"What is the challenge here?"
"204987124-0-81150";"What about Luther? Will he recover?"
"204987124-0-81151";"What's it like being the Count of Skingrad?"
"204987124-0-81152";"How so?"
"204987124-0-81154";"What's next for you and Sergeant Luther?"
"204987124-0-81155";"And your customers?"
"204987124-0-81156";"If I find him or the bear, I'll bring them here."
"204987124-0-81157";"What's it like being the Count of Skingrad?"
"204987124-0-81164";"Yes, Gadayn, we saved West Weald and all of reality."
"204987124-0-81175";"Wisdom? You mean that exchange you had with her before Ithelia entered the portal?"
"204987124-0-81177";"All right. I'll head for the sites Scruut marked on my map now."
"204987124-0-81178";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-81180";"Tell me more about this investigator."
"204987124-0-81181";"Where's this portal?"
"204987124-0-81184";"Speaking of adventures, I meant to ask about what happened at Ninglenirre Pass."
"204987124-0-81187";"I'll look around."
"204987124-0-81188";"Right. Let's get into it."
"204987124-0-81191";"Tell me about the attackers."
"204987124-0-81192";"How are you going to help me find the path?"
"204987124-0-81193";"Why do you think he's dead?"
"204987124-0-81194";"Let's get going, then."
"204987124-0-81197";"I thought I saw some Recollection cultists, too."
"204987124-0-81199";"The camp is cursed?"
"204987124-0-81200";"I'm <<1>>. I found the orders beside a dead legionary. I decided to finish their mission."
"204987124-0-81201";"But you're having trouble?"
"204987124-0-81203";"We're going to stop you, Wisteria."
"204987124-0-81205";"What happens when we find him?"
"204987124-0-81207";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-81208";"That sounds difficult."
"204987124-0-81209";"Good luck."
"204987124-0-81212";"We'll be ready."
"204987124-0-81213";"How do I do that?"
"204987124-0-81214";"But you killed him too."
"204987124-0-81215";"We'll see it done."
"204987124-0-81217";"Now it's Betu who will receive the fortune."
"204987124-0-81226";"What did the rite do?"
"204987124-0-81227";"Ulfsild created you?"
"204987124-0-81229";"That does tend to happen to me."
"204987124-0-81230";"Understood. Nahlia and I will seek it out."
"204987124-0-81231";"I'll talk to her about it."
"204987124-0-81236";"All right, I'll keep the Echonir handy."
"204987124-0-81237";"I see."
"204987124-0-81238";"Hmm."
"204987124-0-81240";"Right."
"204987124-0-81241";"You want to try and live up to what she did?"
"204987124-0-81243";"You think the Guild will take to Scribing?"
"204987124-0-81245";"It was quite the journey, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81247";"They're not all dead. You're still here."
"204987124-0-81250";"Think of everyone we helped in our time together. If that's not cause for redemption, then what is?"
"204987124-0-81251";"Zerith's guilt ties him to Ravith-morna?"
"204987124-0-81253";"What happens then?"
"204987124-0-81255";"What does the Recollection want?"
"204987124-0-81256";"But what are they hoping to accomplish?"
"204987124-0-81268";"Tell me more about the Echonir."
"204987124-0-81273";"All right. I'll talk to Caelum and keep him distracted."
"204987124-0-81275";"I don't believe you. If that were true, you'd have killed Valenia."
"204987124-0-81276";"You're outnumbered. This is an act of desperation—admit it."
"204987124-0-81277";"You're outnumbered. This is an act of desperation—admit it."
"204987124-0-81279";"That's where you're wrong."
"204987124-0-81280";"That's where you're wrong."
"204987124-0-81284";"The Recollection was looking for Ithelia at Elenglynn, but we found her first. Then she vanished."
"204987124-0-81285";"What was the Battle for North Hook?"
"204987124-0-81286";"What do you do for the count?"
"204987124-0-81291";"The new forest?"
"204987124-0-81298";"All right. Let's get in there, then."
"204987124-0-81300";"Good thing he has you."
"204987124-0-81308";"I'll do that."
"204987124-0-81310";"Will you remain in Sutch or move on?"
"204987124-0-81313";"New forest?"
"204987124-0-81314";"In Ostumir, where we found that seed, the Recollection indicated they created the new forest."
"204987124-0-81315";"Could Vashabar's Wood Elves be involved with the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81317";"I'll help you learn more about the wildburn seed."
"204987124-0-81320";"I'll just pay your tab. How big is it?"
"204987124-0-81324";"The ring is just a ring. Your actions are proof to the Divines."
"204987124-0-81326";"Why's that?"
"204987124-0-81331";"I'll help you rescue the villagers and search for Greenspeaker Sorilen."
"204987124-0-81341";"That's quite a story."
"204987124-0-81342";"Your debut?"
"204987124-0-81347";"Stay here. I'll see if anyone is waiting in the woods."
"204987124-0-81348";"You could say that."
"204987124-0-81349";"Follow the road to Skingrad"
"204987124-0-81354";"Yes, I completed the legionary's mission. The signal fires are blazing."
"204987124-0-81356";"Warn him about what exactly?"
"204987124-0-81358";"All right. Let's warn the king before we go to find the cart the greenspeaker told us about."
"204987124-0-81363";"Do you really think that's what we'll find?"
"204987124-0-81364";"You just decided to found a kingdom in West Weald?"
"204987124-0-81366";"All right."
"204987124-0-81367";"Right, let's head back."
"204987124-0-81368";"Remind me of what your reflection said about the Lamp of Clarity."
"204987124-0-81370";"The last Ithelia claimed that the Lamp of Clarity wasn't actually helping you."
"204987124-0-81372";"I better get back to Grander. Goodbye, Amaurel."
"204987124-0-81373";"Meet Tribune Alea, get inside, go up. Got it."
"204987124-0-81374";"Apocrypha's a pretty big place. How will we find her?"
"204987124-0-81376";"All right. I'll go with you to Apocrypha and use the Skein of Secrets."
"204987124-0-81377";"Why is Ithelia doing that? If reality is destroyed, she will be too."
"204987124-0-81378";"So which other brazier do I need to light up?"
"204987124-0-81379";"Ah, I see. Thanks Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81380";"I'll help you find the missing Legion cohort."
"204987124-0-81382";"Do you think you can stabilize the arcane knot?"
"204987124-0-81384";"Why didn't you stay at the camp?"
"204987124-0-81386";"What if there wasn't enough time?"
"204987124-0-81387";"What are you doing to do with the Arcane Knot?"
"204987124-0-81388";"Do you trust the Scribes of Mora?"
"204987124-0-81391";"What's next for you, Orissa?"
"204987124-0-81395";"What should I do?"
"204987124-0-81397";"All right. Let's make a Sage's Dream."
"204987124-0-81398";"That's not all?"
"204987124-0-81399";"That's not all?"
"204987124-0-81400";"That's not all?"
"204987124-0-81401";"Interesting."
"204987124-0-81403";"The Luminaries of Magic?"
"204987124-0-81404";"How do we know they'll be willing to share their strength with the altar again?"
"204987124-0-81405";"Do all the Luminaries have fables like this?"
"204987124-0-81407";"And the door to the Indrik's domain?"
"204987124-0-81408";"Why are the Luminary keys hidden like this?"
"204987124-0-81409";"Do you know who might want to target the caravan?"
"204987124-0-81410";"You don't think the wine is worth retrieving?"
"204987124-0-81413";"Are you sure you don't know who ambushed you?"
"204987124-0-81416";"I should speak with Orissa."
"204987124-0-81419";"Scruut …?"
"204987124-0-81428";"He's going to be selling the things we find here?"
"204987124-0-81429";"Remind me, what should we be asking about?"
"204987124-0-81430";"He's going to be selling the things we find here?"
"204987124-0-81431";"What does he do?"
"204987124-0-81434";"Of course. Take the blade."
"204987124-0-81435";"Of course. Take the blade."
"204987124-0-81436";"Where are we going to find something of Mephala's here in Apocrypha?"
"204987124-0-81437";"Were you two close?"
"204987124-0-81438";"I see. I'll meet you in the Outlaws Refuge of Skingrad."
"204987124-0-81440";"Tell me about House Ravenwatch."
"204987124-0-81441";"Several realities were entangled. Helping Ithelia was the least dangerous thing to do."
"204987124-0-81442";"How do we reach the cellars?"
"204987124-0-81443";"All right. Ready whenever you are, Leramil."
"204987124-0-81445";"Your magic came in handy again."
"204987124-0-81446";"I'll go check out the portal room then."
"204987124-0-81449";"Remind me about House Ravenwatch."
"204987124-0-81450";"Tell me more about Lady Valente."
"204987124-0-81451";"Why is that?"
"204987124-0-81455";"What do you know about the vineyard and winery?"
"204987124-0-81457";"What's that about a new forest?"
"204987124-0-81458";"Could Valenwood have caused this?"
"204987124-0-81459";"We're pretty close to Valenwood, aren't we?"
"204987124-0-81461";"Thank you for talking about it."
"204987124-0-81462";"Why did Greenspeaker Sorilen ask you to meet her here?"
"204987124-0-81464";"So none of them got any of the Vesper Valente?"
"204987124-0-81465";"You've mentioned Ulfsild several times. What did she mean to you?"
"204987124-0-81467";"What happens to the Valente Vineyard now?"
"204987124-0-81468";"You're not worried about word getting out about what happened here?"
"204987124-0-81469";"What do you remember about her?"
"204987124-0-81470";"That's why you helped Ulfsild to perfect the art?"
"204987124-0-81472";"About your husband …."
"204987124-0-81473";"So you're going to run the vineyard and winery?"
"204987124-0-81474";"What's next for you, Lady Ursilia?"
"204987124-0-81476";"An advantage?"
"204987124-0-81479";"So you're going to use the magic we steal to make these watchers?"
"204987124-0-81481";"Why are you and the Fox companions?"
"204987124-0-81482";"But that's not true now?"
"204987124-0-81483";"You seem an odd pairing."
"204987124-0-81484";"What are you going to do with the magic we steal?"
"204987124-0-81485";"How were you born from that magic?"
"204987124-0-81486";"Why are you and the Fox companions?"
"204987124-0-81487";"Why did you choose to be a Gryphon?"
"204987124-0-81490";"You feel compelled to act this way?"
"204987124-0-81493";"Why are you and the Fox companions?"
"204987124-0-81499";"You really do like riddles."
"204987124-0-81500";"All right, Nahlia. Let's go."
"204987124-0-81501";"Where's the Niryastare ruins located?"
"204987124-0-81502";"What's next, Beragon?"
"204987124-0-81504";"Should I go to the Outcast Inn before Feldagard Keep?"
"204987124-0-81505";"Tell me about Feldagard Keep."
"204987124-0-81506";"What else can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-81507";"The Order of the Lamp. Can you tell me more about them?"
"204987124-0-81510";"What is it?"
"204987124-0-81511";"Can you make us a portal to Sunnamere?"
"204987124-0-81512";"What do you think of the Indrik?"
"204987124-0-81514";"How do you know this mortal?"
"204987124-0-81515";"Why is this the last time?"
"204987124-0-81516";"The winds of the soul?"
"204987124-0-81518";"Right. Let's go."
"204987124-0-81524";"Tell me about the Imperial Legion."
"204987124-0-81525";"Tell me about Tribune Alea Idolus."
"204987124-0-81531";"What do you mean about methods?"
"204987124-0-81532";"What should I know about Rustwall Estate?"
"204987124-0-81533";"What should I know about Rustwall Estate?"
"204987124-0-81534";"Why were you jealous?"
"204987124-0-81539";"You want to go after them?"
"204987124-0-81541";"Whatever you need."
"204987124-0-81542";"You seem confident."
"204987124-0-81544";"This turned out to be quite the patrol, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81548";"The Staff of Many Paths? Didn't Shardmarshal Vargas give that to Nantharion at Hoperoot?"
"204987124-0-81550";"I'll help you find King Nantharion and stop him."
"204987124-0-81551";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-81552";"Shouldn't the Skein of Secrets show us where Ithelia is?"
"204987124-0-81553";"You can have the Lamp of Clarity."
"204987124-0-81554";"You can have the Lamp of Clarity."
"204987124-0-81560";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-81561";"So what do we do?"
"204987124-0-81562";"Why are you so happy?"
"204987124-0-81563";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-81566";"Why did you resort to stealing?"
"204987124-0-81568";"What led up to everyone fleeing to the catacombs to hide?"
"204987124-0-81569";"What were you talking about earlier? About the fire, and Caelum Vineyard?"
"204987124-0-81570";"Too late? What happened?"
"204987124-0-81574";"What do you think of that?"
"204987124-0-81575";"Tell me more about Regomor."
"204987124-0-81577";"What do you know about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81578";"We'll destroy the portal. How do we find it?"
"204987124-0-81580";"You're certain no one else from the cohort survived?"
"204987124-0-81581";"But …?"
"204987124-0-81582";"Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-81583";"Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?"
"204987124-0-81584";"When do you think you'll get married?"
"204987124-0-81586";"Good luck with the wedding, Laeni."
"204987124-0-81587";"Your father still believes in the Dawnway?"
"204987124-0-81588";"You're proud of Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-81589";"Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?"
"204987124-0-81590";"He can't marry Laeni and support the village at the same time?"
"204987124-0-81592";"Vashabar?"
"204987124-0-81593";"How did you become Count Calantius's marshal?"
"204987124-0-81594";"How did you get the rank of tribune?"
"204987124-0-81596";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-81599";"How could Spinner Belwelas help?"
"204987124-0-81600";"I'll go talk to Spinner Belwelas then."
"204987124-0-81601";"I'll go talk to Spinner Belwelas, then."
"204987124-0-81602";"How could Spinner Belwelas help?"
"204987124-0-81604";"Why is Ithelia doing that? If reality is destroyed, she will be too."
"204987124-0-81606";"Is everyone in Vashabar a greenspeaker?"
"204987124-0-81607";"That's a wide range of subjects."
"204987124-0-81608";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-81609";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave the village."
"204987124-0-81610";"Why are you here, Bella?"
"204987124-0-81611";"What are you doing?"
"204987124-0-81612";"What are you doing?"
"204987124-0-81613";"Why are you upset?"
"204987124-0-81614";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-81615";"Who threatened you?"
"204987124-0-81616";"What are you doing here?"
"204987124-0-81617";"The Netch wanted to explain things to you itself."
"204987124-0-81618";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Clendagal and Laeni are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-81621";"See you soon, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81622";"Then what exactly is the Skein of Secrets showing us?"
"204987124-0-81623";"Why does it represent you to the village?"
"204987124-0-81624";"You said your families hate each other?"
"204987124-0-81625";"How do you feel about the Green Pact?"
"204987124-0-81626";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-81627";"Did Ithelia pass through Fargrave on her way to somewhere else?"
"204987124-0-81629";"You think Fargrave is Mirrormoor?"
"204987124-0-81633";"Settled down?"
"204987124-0-81635";"You called Sorilen a Greenspeaker. Tell me about them."
"204987124-0-81636";"What does it mean to follow Y'ffre?"
"204987124-0-81637";"Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town."
"204987124-0-81639";"Shardmarshal Vargas. That's the Dremora we fought at Feldagard Keep."
"204987124-0-81640";"What do you know about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81645";"Are you really going to try to find Legionary Ulrath?"
"204987124-0-81655";"Any idea why Greenspeaker Sorilen came to Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-81656";"Tell me about Ostumir."
"204987124-0-81657";"We should go look for Greenspeaker Sorilen."
"204987124-0-81658";"Tell me about Ostumir."
"204987124-0-81660";"All right. If you can shed the power, do it now."
"204987124-0-81661";"Heard from Eveli Sharp-Arrow lately?"
"204987124-0-81662";"I have some other questions."
"204987124-0-81664";"I have some other questions."
"204987124-0-81665";"Do you know why Greenspeaker Sorilen asked you to meet here?"
"204987124-0-81666";"You seem particularly interested in the Ayleids."
"204987124-0-81667";"The Archmagister is going to visit the Scholarium?"

"204987124-0-81678";"Who is Saint Alessia?"
"204987124-0-81680";"The gods came to her aid?"
"204987124-0-81683";"You duel people in Tribute?"
"204987124-0-81685";"Did you say you created a Tribute deck?"
"204987124-0-81686";"Why aren't there many knights in the order?"
"204987124-0-81687";"What do you know about the anomaly?"
"204987124-0-81689";"Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?"
"204987124-0-81691";"What else can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-81698";"Why do you think the portal needs more than one person to grant entry?"
"204987124-0-81699";"What do you want to do now?"
"204987124-0-81700";"Why would this be controversial?"
"204987124-0-81702";"Why would this be controversial?"
"204987124-0-81703";"Tell me about greenspeakers."
"204987124-0-81704";"Beragon explained that this forest growth happened recently. Is it the result of greenspeaking?"
"204987124-0-81705";"Why did you come to Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-81707";"Why do you think she's behaving that way?"
"204987124-0-81708";"What kind of place is Ostumir?"
"204987124-0-81709";"Do you know where Ithelia was exiled?"
"204987124-0-81710";"We can save Curate Gadayn?"
"204987124-0-81712";"What was that last exchange between you and Ithelia?"
"204987124-0-81715";"You called this place the Scholarium? Where are we?"
"204987124-0-81716";"What do you mean? They knew they wouldn't be together forever?"
"204987124-0-81717";"You said the Luminaries could teach me about Scribing?"

"204987124-0-81728";"Thanks. I'll let you know if I need help with a riddle."
"204987124-0-81729";"Thanks. I'll let you know if I need help with a riddle."
"204987124-0-81730";"Why did you choose to be a Dragon?"
"204987124-0-81732";"I'd like to talk about the other Luminaries."
"204987124-0-81733";"I have no idea."
"204987124-0-81734";"Why did you choose to be a Dragon?"
"204987124-0-81737";"Tears in the fabric of reality. It sounds so metaphorical."
"204987124-0-81738";"How is coming up with a riddle a trial?"
"204987124-0-81739";"Can I ask you questions, to understand you better?"

"204987124-0-81746";"Right."
"204987124-0-81747";"So she spoke to the Dragon before she lost the Scholarium."
"204987124-0-81748";"And that's the paradox?"
"204987124-0-81750";"Thanks for explaining it to me, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81754";"What do you know about the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81755";"The note indicates they're trying to recover a wildburn seed."
"204987124-0-81757";"They were bringing Daedra through a portal. We shut it down."
"204987124-0-81758";"Anything else you can tell me about the Wildburn?"
"204987124-0-81759";"You created a Tribute deck?"
"204987124-0-81763";"Anything else?"
"204987124-0-81764";"What's Mirrormoor? Why is this happening?"
"204987124-0-81765";"The gods came to her aid?"
"204987124-0-81766";"You duel people in Tribute?"
"204987124-0-81769";"Do you have proof that your father was murdered?"

"204987124-0-81777";"Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?"
"204987124-0-81778";"The order is fading away?"
"204987124-0-81779";"What do you know about the anomaly?"
"204987124-0-81781";"So what now, Leramil?"
"204987124-0-81783";"So what really happened here, legionary?"
"204987124-0-81785";"What is it, Beragon?"
"204987124-0-81794";"And then what?"
"204987124-0-81795";"Tell me about that."
"204987124-0-81797";"What can I expect in the sunken ruins?"
"204987124-0-81800";"Are you talking about her husband? Shalidor?"
"204987124-0-81801";"What does the art of Scribing mean to you?"
"204987124-0-81802";"What happens if we don't find all your facets?"
"204987124-0-81803";"What happens if we don't find all your facets?"
"204987124-0-81804";"What happens if we don't find all your facets?"
"204987124-0-81805";"Why did your facets run away in the first place?"
"204987124-0-81806";"I'll search for the wildburn seed with Beragon."
"204987124-0-81808";"How are you going to avoid the Recollection forces?"
"204987124-0-81812";"What do you want to do about the wildburn seed?"
"204987124-0-81819";"Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?"
"204987124-0-81821";"It was good working with you, Nahlia."
"204987124-0-81825";"Why would Greenspeaker Sorilen join the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81826";"I'm ready to go. Let's see what's on the other side of that portal."
"204987124-0-81827";"Is that what made you sign up?"
"204987124-0-81828";"Why would Greenspeaker Sorilen join the Recollection?"
"204987124-0-81829";"Why are we responsible for ending this threat?"
"204987124-0-81831";"She hasn't made any requests?"
"204987124-0-81832";"I'll go get water from the well for you."
"204987124-0-81834";"Can you tell me about the cracked sky?"
"204987124-0-81835";"Tell me about the Outcast Inn."
"204987124-0-81836";"Did you always want to be an innkeep?"
"204987124-0-81837";"Did you try asking the woman to leave?"
"204987124-0-81841";"These echoes. Can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-0-81842";"Tell me what you do remember about yourself."
"204987124-0-81843";"I'll find that crystal, then."
"204987124-0-81845";"I'll find a new focus in the east wing."
"204987124-0-81847";"I'll talk to Nahlia."

"204987124-0-81853";"Who are the associates you want to bring back?"
"204987124-0-81854";"Why that group?"
"204987124-0-81855";"Why wouldn't you be available?"
"204987124-0-81856";"That's why you became a knight in the Order of the Lamp?"
"204987124-0-81858";"Who are the associates you want to bring back?"
"204987124-0-81859";"And Chronicler Firandil?"
"204987124-0-81860";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"

"204987124-0-81862";"Your cellar connects to old ruins?"
"204987124-0-81864";"I'll see what Ulfsild has to say, then."
"204987124-0-81867";"What about the ritual?"
"204987124-0-81874";"All right, I'll use the lens and find the Indrik's wards."
"204987124-0-81875";"How will you facilitate Scribing?"
"204987124-0-81876";"Thanks, Chronicler."
"204987124-0-81879";"So mages … annoy them?"
"204987124-0-81880";"I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar."
"204987124-0-81885";"I'll place the fable on the dais, then."
"204987124-0-81886";"How will that open your door?"
"204987124-0-81887";"How will that open your door?"

"204987124-0-81899";"Why did you lend your power to the fawn?"
"204987124-0-81900";"If it's so simple why is Scribing a lost art?"
"204987124-0-81901";"What is the Netch like?"

"204987124-0-81922";"The Indrik helped you find supplies?"
"204987124-0-81924";"I wonder if the other Luminaries will help you find scripts and grimoires."
"204987124-0-81925";"You're selling things, though. Is Chronicler a fancy title for a clerk?"
"204987124-0-81926";"What does a Chronicler do, exactly?"
"204987124-0-81928";"The Indrik helped you find supplies?"

"204987124-0-81967";"Her notes are already visible without the lens?"
"204987124-0-81968";"How is that fox the Gryphon's soft spot?"
"204987124-0-81969";"You said he lost it to Sheogorath in a wager?"

"204987124-0-81986";"Are you a Luminary, like the Gryphon?"
"204987124-0-81987";"That's why I'm asking if you're a Luminary."
"204987124-0-81988";"You were stealing food?"
"204987124-0-81989";"Can you go anywhere you want?"

"204987124-0-82050";"You think the Gryphon is pathetic?"
"204987124-0-82051";"You don't think the Netch accomplishes anything?"
"204987124-0-82052";"The Indrik seemed focused on the responsibility of your power."
"204987124-0-82053";"I have a few other questions."
"204987124-0-82054";"I have a few other questions."

"204987124-0-82068";"How did you come to join the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-82071";"Good idea. I'll be back after I consult her notes."
"204987124-0-82073";"I'll go looking for those notes."
"204987124-0-82074";"How did you learn of this?"
"204987124-0-82075";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-82080";"Did his letter say anything else that can help with our investigation?"
"204987124-0-82081";"What do you want me to do next?"
"204987124-0-82084";"Zerith and I will do our best."
"204987124-0-82089";"Since I'm new here, what should I know about the town of Ontus?"
"204987124-0-82090";"But you chose to stay?"
"204987124-0-82091";"What was the story about, then?"
"204987124-0-82093";"What does this mean for you now?"
"204987124-0-82094";"Wasn't Ithelia different when she wandered West Weald? She was as powerless as a mortal."
"204987124-0-82095";"No but she walked among mortals, experienced change in herself and her reflections. Can we use that?"
"204987124-0-82096";"What are you thinking, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-82098";"But you saw the truth. You know what happened. You can change."
"204987124-0-82099";"Can't you simply surrender?"
"204987124-0-82100";"Why did Ulfsild develop Scribing?"
"204987124-0-82102";"Scribing was a way for her to help others see magic like she did?"
"204987124-0-82103";"She combined art with magic?"
"204987124-0-82104";"The Luminaries lent her strength?"
"204987124-0-82105";"I have many other questions for you."
"204987124-0-82106";"They're flexible. That's where the scripts come in?"
"204987124-0-82107";"I have many other questions for you."
"204987124-0-82108";"I have many other questions for you."
"204987124-0-82109";"Every Luminary has their own domain, their own wing like this?"
"204987124-0-82110";"What's your opinion?"
"204987124-0-82111";"Your power runs into the Scholarium through the door?"
"204987124-0-82112";"I have a few other questions before I go."
"204987124-0-82113";"I have a few other questions before I go."
"204987124-0-82114";"I have a few other questions before I go."
"204987124-0-82115";"If the threat to reality comes from your power, what about someplace where there is no power?"
"204987124-0-82117";"You're going to help us carry out this plan, right?"
"204987124-0-82118";"Then is my service to Hermaeus Mora done now, Scruut?"
"204987124-0-82123";"That's incredible."
"204987124-0-82125";"What fires?"
"204987124-0-82127";"How can I stop the fires?"
"204987124-0-82129";"Thanks, Ulfsild."
"204987124-0-82131";"Have you forgiven Fennorian for abandoning you when you were betrothed?"
"204987124-0-82132";"What do you think of High Cantor Viti?"
"204987124-0-82143";"How did you end up in Detritus?"
"204987124-0-82144";"Ja'zennji Siir? Where's that?"
"204987124-0-82148";"Hermaeus Mora pulled Gadayn from the Many Paths. Are you sure this is our Gadayn?"
"204987124-0-82152";"Thanks for helping me through all this, Leramil. And enjoy your vacation!"
"204987124-0-82154";"What do you plan to do?"
"204987124-0-82156";"How did this happen?"
"204987124-0-82157";"How did you end up in Detritus?"
"204987124-0-82160";"You never saw that as a problem before."
"204987124-0-82161";"Why do you think he didn't free Ravith from the darkness?"
"204987124-0-82162";"Sounds like you might be homesick for the Elsweyr of your time."
"204987124-0-82165";"Take us where?"
"204987124-0-82166";"Does this mean I'll get to see the world as it was in your time?"
"204987124-0-82169";"All right. I'll talk to Zerith."
"204987124-0-82170";"What message?"
"204987124-0-82175";"Can we talk more about the Chronicler?"
"204987124-0-82177";"So they prey on the very people who might stop them."
"204987124-0-82192";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-82193";"Don't the Twilight Cantors worship Azurah, just like the Hidden Moon?"
"204987124-0-82194";"What was that message, again?"
"204987124-0-82195";"Can you remind me who Cantor Viti is?"
"204987124-0-82200";"What can you tell me about this place?"
"204987124-0-82201";"Didn't Zerith say something similar to her at the Vile Manse?"
"204987124-0-82205";"What exactly happened at Kilkreath Temple?"
"204987124-0-82206";"What was the deal?"
"204987124-0-82207";"And I was to be his latest victim?"
"204987124-0-82211";"Feel what?"
"204987124-0-82213";"So all we have to do to stop Ravith-morna is convince Zerith to forgive himself?"
"204987124-0-82215";"High Cantor Viti? I was wondering where she was."
"204987124-0-82219";"We need to find her first. How can we do that?"
"204987124-0-82221";"I do. I'll pour it into the ritual basin."
"204987124-0-82222";"Tell me more about the Bent Dance."
"204987124-0-82224";"Then I'm with you, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82243";"Hyacinth. Wisteria. Oleander. Those are all the names of flowers, right?"
"204987124-0-82244";"What kind of flower is Tanlorin?"
"204987124-0-82246";"Why do you know Wisteria's resonating fluid recipe?"
"204987124-0-82248";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-82250";"If someone is in need of help, why won't they let you look into it?"
"204987124-0-82252";"All right. I'll investigate this star that fell near Moonmont."
"204987124-0-82253";"It doesn't look like you're bleeding to me."
"204987124-0-82254";"Who showed you this?"
"204987124-0-82256";"How did you end up like this?"
"204987124-0-82262";"Do you recall anything else?"
"204987124-0-82263";"You keep mentioning threads of fate, what are they?"
"204987124-0-82266";"Kill any I find? How many Marauders are there?"
"204987124-0-82272";"He awoke inside the tomb. He's been in there for a long time. I think it's his tomb."
"204987124-0-82274";"He wants me to meet him in Rawl'kha."
"204987124-0-82276";"What kind of remnants?"
"204987124-0-82278";"All right, I can help you."
"204987124-0-82279";"And that's why you want the Ayleid remnants?"
"204987124-0-82283";"And that's what drew the guard's attention?"
"204987124-0-82285";"How can I find them?"
"204987124-0-82286";"I have some questions, Zerith-var."
"204987124-0-82287";"What will you do with this information?"
"204987124-0-82291";"<Lie> I didn't find anything at Moonmont."
"204987124-0-82292";"Are you saying Moon-Singer Talbira felt guilty, too?"
"204987124-0-82293";"Is there anything you've found in the first bundle?"
"204987124-0-82295";"What do you think this means?"
"204987124-0-82296";"Why do you think so?"
"204987124-0-82297";"Are you thinking about leaving them?"
"204987124-0-82298";"And High Cantor Viti came with you?"
"204987124-0-82299";"Zerith says Azurah sent him here to deal with the Rajaska."
"204987124-0-82300";"I'm listening."
"204987124-0-82302";"All right. I'll accompany you to Monkey's Rest."
"204987124-0-82304";"What happened then?"
"204987124-0-82306";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-82307";"You do this for your family, then?"
"204987124-0-82312";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-82313";"You were a soldier in Wrothgar?"
"204987124-0-82314";"So you left?"
"204987124-0-82320";"Do you remember anything else?"
"204987124-0-82321";"Do you remember anything else?"
"204987124-0-82327";"What's a moonclaw?"
"204987124-0-82329";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-82330";"I suppose we'll find out."
"204987124-0-82331";"<Enter Exiled Redoubt.>"
"204987124-0-82333";"I'll help you stop the Albuses."
"204987124-0-82338";"What does he think your Elder Scroll contains?"
"204987124-0-82339";"Orpheon is dead. What is my reward for remaining Undaunted?"
"204987124-0-82340";"<Enter Lep Seclusa.>"
"204987124-0-82342";"I'll help you stop Orpheon the Tactician."
"204987124-0-82347";"I need to tell you about the fate of the Order of the Hidden Moon."
"204987124-0-82348";"You mentioned the spirit of a little cat?"
"204987124-0-82349";"Tell me more about dro-m'Athra."
"204987124-0-82364";"I'm a necromancer, too."
"204987124-0-82365";"The tablet said you died fighting Rajaska. Did you really die?"
"204987124-0-82366";"The tablet said you died fighting Rajaska. Did you really die?"
"204987124-0-82367";"I call forth the dead to do my bidding. It doesn't matter to me if they're willing or not."
"204987124-0-82370";"I have some questions, Zerith-var."
"204987124-0-82371";"I wielded the Moonlight Blade and restored Arum-Khal's spirit."
"204987124-0-82373";"Remind me about our last encounter with Rajaska. What do I need to know?"
"204987124-0-82374";"Have you had any contact with Cantor Krin'ze since the incident at the Vile Manse?"
"204987124-0-82375";"And you know all this because you fought Rajaska before?"
"204987124-0-82376";"That sounds difficult to deal with."
"204987124-0-82377";"Have you learned more about the Riddle'Thar?"
"204987124-0-82379";"You mentioned the Bent Dance?"
"204987124-0-82381";"Do you think the Ayleids made these?"
"204987124-0-82382";"What do Dawnway Elves think of Daedra?"
"204987124-0-82383";"Do you suspect people in the Dawnway worship Daedra?"
"204987124-0-82384";"How did you manage to slip away from Inquisitor Sabannar?"
"204987124-0-82388";"What was the Ayleid Diaspora?"
"204987124-0-82395";"Do you believe the other Dawnway Elves will feel the same way?"
"204987124-0-82401";"I'll help you. But I'm not sure where the Shrine of Consummate S'rendarr is."
"204987124-0-82402";"I'm not sure. What are they?"
"204987124-0-82404";"Are moon-singers like Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-82405";"Are moon-singers like Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-82406";"Why does ensnaring the soul of a moon-singer make for a more powerful dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-82407";"Are moon-singers like Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-82409";"It looks good. You'll fit right in."
"204987124-0-82410";"Not exactly. They're working with Krin'ze, the Twilight Cantor who sent me after the fallen star."
"204987124-0-82411";"You changed out of your rags. Where did you get that armor?"
"204987124-0-82412";"What should I know about the Rajaska?"
"204987124-0-82413";"What should I know about the Rajaska?"
"204987124-0-82417";"Is the Mages Guild keeping this a secret?"
"204987124-0-82418";"I'll help Votary Nahlia assess this magical anomaly."
"204987124-0-82420";"All right. Let's take a look in the ruins below."
"204987124-0-82424";"Why did you name him Ja'kh?"
"204987124-0-82425";"So the Dark Moon gives you power?"
"204987124-0-82426";"Is that why you joined the Order of the Hidden Moon?"
"204987124-0-82427";"Can you tell me more about the Temple of the Dark Moon?"
"204987124-0-82428";"So how does your moonclaw factor into this?"
"204987124-0-82429";"Let's see what we can find."
"204987124-0-82430";"You mentioned something about sorrow in your life before."
"204987124-0-82431";"Tell me about Ja'kh."
"204987124-0-82435";"Why do you think that is?"
"204987124-0-82438";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-82439";"And the second?"
"204987124-0-82442";"All right. I'll get what we need."
"204987124-0-82443";"How did she do that?"
"204987124-0-82444";"And that's when Ravith became Ravith-morna?"
"204987124-0-82446";"I'm ready."
"204987124-0-82447";"All right. Let's go save the Twilight Cantors."
"204987124-0-82448";"Are you saying you want to travel with me?"
"204987124-0-82449";"Then how did you die?"
"204987124-0-82450";"Misled how?"
"204987124-0-82451";"What are the Fabled?"
"204987124-0-82452";"You mentioned the spirit of a little cat?"
"204987124-0-82453";"You mentioned the spirit of a little cat?"
"204987124-0-82454";"What happened to you in the archive?"
"204987124-0-82455";"So you spent most of your time writing?"
"204987124-0-82456";"Are you going to work with the Inquisitors again?"
"204987124-0-82457";"Zerith thinks you and the other Twilight Cantors are at risk of being hunted by the Rajaska."
"204987124-0-82458";"Do you think our paths will cross again?"
"204987124-0-82459";"What do you hope to find?"
"204987124-0-82460";"I don't understand."
"204987124-0-82461";"That doesn't sound good."
"204987124-0-82463";"Tell me more about the Dawnway."
"204987124-0-82465";"How long will I have to wait?"
"204987124-0-82466";"I'd like to know a little more about your book."
"204987124-0-82467";"Is that why you're researching the Ayleids?"
"204987124-0-82468";"I'd like to know a little more about your book."
"204987124-0-82469";"So you did some traveling?"
"204987124-0-82470";"Where is this meeting place she mentioned?"
"204987124-0-82472";"Right. Let's get to Grahtwood."
"204987124-0-82473";"Where did the brigand run off to?"
"204987124-0-82474";"I'll search Fyrelight Cave for your stolen dowry."
"204987124-0-82479";"Zerith battled Ravith-morna in the past."
"204987124-0-82480";"Can you remind me who High Cantor Viti is?"
"204987124-0-82482";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-82483";"Pain is stopping you from revealing the truth? Even to me?"
"204987124-0-82484";"Why is speaking this truth such a challenge for you?"
"204987124-0-82488";"All right. We'll head to Pa'alat and see if anyone has noticed any Inquisitors in the area."
"204987124-0-82489";"How is the moon-singer's song coming along?"
"204987124-0-82490";"Then what do you suggest we do for Cantor Krin'ze?"
"204987124-0-82492";"Tell me the rest."
"204987124-0-82493";"How do you feel about this?"
"204987124-0-82495";"Tanlorin, give him the healing poultice."
"204987124-0-82497";"What sort of information?"
"204987124-0-82500";"Let me see what Zerith thinks about all this."
"204987124-0-82502";"Where is Crimson Cove?"
"204987124-0-82504";"All right. Let's head to Crimson Cove."
"204987124-0-82506";"You can rely on me, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82507";"You can rely on me, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82508";"Do you have any words of advice for beating the Marauders?"
"204987124-0-82509";"What happened to you in the archive?"
"204987124-0-82511";"Less cordial? What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-82512";"Why do you think Constable Ulbren was investigating an illness?"
"204987124-0-82513";"What was that about the ranch and the quarry being less coridal?"
"204987124-0-82514";"Tell me about fatigue fever."
"204987124-0-82517";"Eifa became a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-82518";"That's why you brought Zerith-var here?"
"204987124-0-82520";"This is what Zerith does. Let's see what he thinks about all this."
"204987124-0-82524";"I need to consult with Zerith and see what he thinks about investigating Predator Mesa."
"204987124-0-82525";"A summoning? I don't understand."
"204987124-0-82526";"We'll find a way to stop her."
"204987124-0-82528";"What do you think, Zerith?"
"204987124-0-82529";"Remind me about our last encounter with Rajaska. What do I need to know?"
"204987124-0-82532";"All right, we'll see if anyone saw Cantor Izalgo."
"204987124-0-82534";"Will anything be enough to avenge you?"
"204987124-0-82535";"What is it like being a vengeful ghost?"
"204987124-0-82536";"Will anything be enough to avenge you?"
"204987124-0-82553";"And you never told anyone? How did you explain Talbira's death?"
"204987124-0-82554";"Why didn't you at least tell Cantor Krin'ze?"
"204987124-0-82561";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-0-82568";"From what I saw, they're real enough."
"204987124-0-82569";"Is that what bothers you? That they're copies?"
"204987124-0-82570";"Are you sure this is how you want to spend your afterlife?"
"204987124-0-82571";"So, you want me to kill all of the Marauders?"
"204987124-0-82572";"I don't think I can go along with your revenge."
"204987124-0-82573";"I get it. You care more about the Marauders' pain than their deaths."
"204987124-0-82574";"I get it. You care more about the Marauders' pain than their deaths."
"204987124-0-82575";"What happened to you in the archive?"
"204987124-0-82576";"The other Twilight Cantors haven't been warned about the danger?"
"204987124-0-82577";"What else can you tell me about Cantor Izalgo?"
"204987124-0-82578";"Aren't the Inquisitors of the Torval Curiata focused on protecting you?"
"204987124-0-82579";"Before? You mean before you were conscripted by the Inquisitors?"
"204987124-0-82581";"You must have some idea."
"204987124-0-82582";"You said Cantor Izalgo isn't the first of your order to go missing?"
"204987124-0-82583";"You gave up being protege of High Cantor Viti because of me and Zerith?"
"204987124-0-82584";"How well do you know him?"
"204987124-0-82585";"What were you doing before Cantor Izalgo disappeared?"
"204987124-0-82602";"Dro-m'Athra are part of the duality of the souls of Khajiit?"
"204987124-0-82603";"So because of what happened with Eifa, you immediately saw Zerith as a threat?"
"204987124-0-82604";"And once Khajiit hear the Bent Dance, they always become a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-0-82605";"What are you thinking Tanlorin?"
"204987124-0-82607";"All right, to the Labyrinth."
"204987124-0-82609";"So how do we find it?"
"204987124-0-82610";"Toc"
"204987124-0-82613";"Let's go."
"204987124-0-82616";"You can do that?"
"204987124-0-82618";"Tell me more about the Proxy Queen."
"204987124-0-82619";"You want Cantor Krin'ze to come with us?"
"204987124-0-82620";"Let's see what Zerith thinks."
"204987124-0-82622";"Has Talbira showed you anything else?"
"204987124-0-82623";"You're taking this very well."
"204987124-0-82624";"What was Talbira's message, again?"
"204987124-0-82625";"What do you think it means?"
"204987124-0-82626";"If you and Talbira share a soul, why don't you know specifically what she's talking about?"
"204987124-0-82627";"What do you think Talbira's message means, then?"
"204987124-0-82628";"What will you tell the Inquisitors if they end up questioning you?"
"204987124-0-82629";"And you're sure you're all right?"
"204987124-0-82638";"Why do you think it happened?"
"204987124-0-82645";"Did you make it to the mission?"
"204987124-0-82652";"All right. Last question. Is Hyacinth a Ceythalmor agent?"
"204987124-0-82653";"Tell me more about Lord Hollowjack."
"204987124-0-82654";"What should I know about Khenarthi's Rise?"
"204987124-0-82660";"Who are you?"
"204987124-0-82662";"That isn't good enough."
"204987124-0-82669";"All right. But let's see what we can learn about the high cantor's intentions first."
"204987124-0-82670";"How else are you meant to learn if you can't make mistakes?"
"204987124-0-82671";"You're welcome, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82672";"You're welcome, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82675";"You're right. Our choices define us. Including your choice to quit here or keep going."
"204987124-0-82676";"Why do you say that?"
"204987124-0-82677";"How did you know the kidnappers were here?"
"204987124-0-82678";"Do you know why he left?"
"204987124-0-82679";"No one saw you following them?"
"204987124-0-82681";"Of course."
"204987124-0-82682";"Of course."
"204987124-0-82683";"What else can you tell me about the Albus family?"
"204987124-0-82684";"Is the initiation that intimidating?"
"204987124-0-82685";"What else can you tell me about the Albus family?"
"204987124-0-82686";"You haven't taken the trial?"
"204987124-0-82687";"If Azurah wants you to experience highs and lows, then you've lived just as she wants you to."
"204987124-0-82689";"Of course, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82690";"Of course, Zerith."
"204987124-0-82691";"Do you know what happened to Martus?"
"204987124-0-82692";"What else can you tell me about the Albus Family?"
"204987124-0-82693";"What else can you tell me about the Albus family?"
"204987124-0-82697";"So he kills soldiers and blames the alliances."
"204987124-0-82698";"Did you get all the prisoners out?"
"204987124-0-82699";"You believe them?"
"204987124-0-82700";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-82701";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-82702";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82704";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82705";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82706";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82707";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82709";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82710";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82711";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82713";"So they kept the prisoners alive just to execute them?"
"204987124-0-82714";"How will killing their loved ones convince the noble houses to join Cato's cause?"
"204987124-0-82715";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-82716";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82717";"How do you feel about our friendship?"
"204987124-0-82719";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82720";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82721";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82722";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82725";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82726";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82727";"Let's talk about something else."
"204987124-0-82728";"When was that?"
"204987124-0-82729";"It does refer to you as a heretic."
"204987124-0-82730";"Why did Vandorallen train at the Battlespire, but not Caecilius?"
"204987124-0-82731";"How could the generals confuse peace workers for a spies?"
"204987124-0-82733";"Do you think the high cantor is in danger?"
"204987124-0-82734";"Is there danger in Orcrest?"
"204987124-0-82737";"What will you do now?"
"204987124-0-82738";"And after that?"
"204987124-0-82740";"Do you think the noble families will stop following Cato Albus's revenge plan?"
"204987124-0-82742";"He couldn't. His spirit was confused, but I think I helped him remember himself."
"204987124-0-82743";"That's still the plan for Cato Albus?"
"204987124-0-82745";"How did the Inquisitors track down the Rajaska?"
"204987124-0-82747";"Where are the other Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-82748";"If you move quickly, you should be able to make it from here safely."
"204987124-0-82750";"We cleared a path. You should be safe to leave."
"204987124-0-82752";"The path to safety is clear."
"204987124-0-82754";"We can stop this, right?"
"204987124-0-82756";"I'm with you, tamiit. Let's stop Ravith-morna."
"204987124-0-82757";"Enough about the past. How do we make this right?"
"204987124-0-82758";"You really kept Moon-Singer Talbira's murder a secret from everyone in your order?"
"204987124-0-82759";"So your order just made an assumption about Talbira and you didn't correct them?"
"204987124-0-82760";"But your blade wasn't used for mercy."
"204987124-0-82761";"So what happened?"
"204987124-0-82762";"Why do you think that is? Why do you think you were sent back?"
"204987124-0-82763";"And she believed you?"
"204987124-0-82764";"But you both died, yet you're both back now."
"204987124-0-82766";"Why didn't Ravith-morna kill you after you killed Talbira?"
"204987124-0-82767";"You said you died facing Ravith-morna. How did that actually happen?"
"204987124-0-82768";"You really kept Moon-Singer Talbira's murder a secret from everyone in your order?"
"204987124-0-82792";"I'll help you. Let's see what we can do to restore Khenarthi's Rise."
"204987124-0-82807";"That trance you were in. Is that how you know that Zerith's guilt is giving Ravith-morna her power?"
"204987124-0-82808";"No. We haven't seen High Cantor Viti since we parted ways in Predator Mesa."
"204987124-0-82811";"You said High Cantor Viti went to get the other Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-82812";"And that sort of connection is strong enough for Ravith-morna to draw power from him?"
"204987124-0-82814";"We'll save the Twilight Cantors and then see if we can deal with this moon beast."
"204987124-0-82996";"Good. But we don't know where she is."
"204987124-0-82997";"I'm glad to hear it. But how do we find her?"
"204987124-0-83059";"So one mistake in a war led to all of this?"
"204987124-0-83081";"She asked us to look for Cantor Izalgo. We discovered that Rajaska lured him to Goldfolly."
"204987124-0-83083";"The Rajaska are hunting Twilight Cantors. We can stop them."
"204987124-0-83084";"What are you talking about?"
"204987124-0-83093";"Where should I find you after I get the supplies?"
"204987124-0-83095";"How well did you know Vandorallen?"
"204987124-0-83096";"I'll check with Tanlorin about their progress."
"204987124-0-83097";"Are you and Tanlorin close?"
"204987124-0-83098";"Then how did you and Talbira stop Ravith-morna?"
"204987124-0-83100";"All right, Zerith. End the ritual."
"204987124-0-83103";"I'm in. Where should I meet you?"
"204987124-0-83108";"Can you explain what the message means to me?"
"204987124-0-83129";"Tell me more about the Twilight Cantors."
"204987124-0-83130";"Riddle'Thar Epiphany?"
"204987124-0-83131";"Tell me about High Cantor Viti."
"204987124-0-83132";"Then why help them at all?"
"204987124-0-83133";"I know Adara-hai of the Twilight Cantors. Is she involved in this?"
"204987124-0-83134";"I'll think about it."
"204987124-0-83135";"Have you worked with Inquisitor Sabannar long?"
"204987124-0-83136";"What should I do if I encounter dro-m'Athra at Moonmont?"
"204987124-0-83137";"What's so important that you need the help of the Twilight Cantors?"
"204987124-0-83139";"So you died fighting a type of dro-m'Athra known as a Rajaska. Do you remember what happened?"
"204987124-0-83142";"An adept turned lich named Arum-Khal brought it down from the inside."
"204987124-0-83143";"And what is your duty, exactly?"
"204987124-0-83144";"I need to tell you about the fate of the Order of the Hidden Moon."
"204987124-0-83145";"You can use it to open portals?"
"204987124-0-83146";"I need to tell you about the fate of the Order of the Hidden Moon."
"204987124-0-83153";"Prince Azah sent me in his place. Tell me what you know."
"204987124-0-83155";"So where's Guildmaster Merric now?"
"204987124-0-83156";"All right. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-83157";"Actually, we might be able to help. Let me talk to Zerith-var."
"204987124-0-83158";"And how did you do that?"
"204987124-0-83159";"Where does your order reside?"
"204987124-0-83160";"All right. I'll meet you at the ruins of Belarata in Malabal Tor."
"204987124-0-83161";"Why did you wait for me before you went to answer the Gardener's summons?"
"204987124-0-83162";"Is he a noble or a merchant?"
"204987124-0-83163";"Are they all like Hyacinth's?"
"204987124-0-83164";"Tell me about the Gardener."
"204987124-0-83165";"Tell me about the Gardener."
"204987124-0-83169";"How do you know so much about grief?"
"204987124-0-83170";"Are you going to warn other Twilight Cantors about this?"
"204987124-0-83171";"Are you going to work with the Inquisitors again?"
"204987124-0-83172";"Are you going to tell people about Zerith-var?"
"204987124-0-83174";"So where's Guildmaster Merric now?"
"204987124-0-83176";"Do you know where they took her?"
"204987124-0-83178";"You're not afraid of turning into a dro-m'Athra, are you?"
"204987124-0-83179";"What are these tests you're talking about?"
"204987124-0-83184";"All right, I'll try to break the ice."
"204987124-0-83187";"We're at a dead end. I'm not sure where they would have taken Cantor Izalgo."
"204987124-0-83188";"Aren't Krin'ze and Viti vulnerable to the dark song? Are you sure they should come with us?"
"204987124-0-83190";"I'm ready. Let's go to Predator Mesa."
"204987124-0-83191";"All right, I'll get you some mistscrub leaves."
"204987124-0-83195";"Have you learned more about the Riddle'Thar?"
"204987124-0-83197";"The wonders of this age?"
"204987124-0-83199";"Remind me about our last encounter with Rajaska. What do I need to know?"
"204987124-0-83204";"And we'll need to find Ravith-morna."
"204987124-0-83205";"How does that help us?"
"204987124-0-83206";"That's us. Where's the vault?"
"204987124-0-83208";"Thank you."
"204987124-0-83209";"All right. Where do you want to start?"
"204987124-0-83217";"Ravith was the love of your life, wasn't she?"
"204987124-0-83224";"Of course. That's what Prince Azah is paying me for."
"204987124-0-83225";"And who are you exactly?"
"204987124-0-83226";"Snapdragon was right about the traitor."
"204987124-0-83227";"The traitor to the Garland Ring. What do we know?"
"204987124-0-83228";"Do you have any idea who the traitor is?"
"204987124-0-83229";"Remind me, why did Snapdragon leave the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83230";"Has Snapdragon rejoined the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83231";"Do you ever miss it?"
"204987124-0-83232";"The traitor to the Garland Ring. What do we know?"
"204987124-0-83233";"We'll find them, Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-83234";"How did Hyacinth capture that moment on the disk?"
"204987124-0-83236";"What would it mean if she manages to summon this hunter?"
"204987124-0-83237";"Can you explain Azurah's Crossing to me?"
"204987124-0-83238";"What would it mean if she manages to summon this hunter?"
"204987124-0-83242";"What are your thoughts on our travels together, Zerith?"
"204987124-0-83250";"That seems likely, but there may still be time to save whoever's still alive deeper inside."
"204987124-0-83253";"Any thoughts about the soul reapers?"
"204987124-0-83254";"I'm sorry, Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-83257";"You're right."
"204987124-0-83286";"Merric broke free of the spell and attacked the soul reaper. It exploded and killed him."
"204987124-0-83290";"Merric's actions saved your sanctum. The Worm Cult left as soon as the device was destroyed."
"204987124-0-83292";"So what's the situation here?"
"204987124-0-83306";"What if we need help?"
"204987124-0-83308";"Before your tattoos?"
"204987124-0-83328";"Do you want a look at that journal entry I found near Echo Pond?"
"204987124-0-83329";"Why do you think the Ceythalmor are targeting the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-0-83330";"She was honest by calling your dream childish?"
"204987124-0-83338";"So how did you end up in the ice trap?"
"204987124-0-83339";"Let's make our way to Monkey's Rest."
"204987124-0-83340";"All right. And the Garland Ring …?"
"204987124-0-83341";"Sounds like you enjoy this line of work?"
"204987124-0-83342";"What does that mean?"
"204987124-0-83343";"If you're uncomfortable talking about this …."
"204987124-0-83344";"Hyacinth. Wisteria. Oleander. Those are all the names of flowers, right?"
"204987124-0-83345";"What do you think Tanlorin would say?"
"204987124-0-83351";"You really want to travel with me for awhile, Tanlorin?"
"204987124-0-83359";"What about Moon-Singer Talbira?"
"204987124-0-83377";"Why did Snapdragon leave the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83379";"Betrayed by someone in the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83380";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-83384";"I meant, have you recovered from your wounds?"
"204987124-0-83393";"You admired her?"
"204987124-0-83408";"Do you think she knows more than she's saying?"
"204987124-0-83465";"Why do you think it's destroyed?"
"204987124-0-83466";"What was in the scrolls you read?"
"204987124-0-83467";"How long did it take you to lose your sight?"
"204987124-0-83468";"Where does this portal go?"
"204987124-0-83469";"I just know what Snapdragon told us."
"204987124-0-83481";"Instead, it was me."
"204987124-0-83483";"That's the spirit."
"204987124-0-83485";"Hyacinth. Wisteria. Oleander. Those are all the names of flowers, right?"
"204987124-0-83486";"Was she trying to protect you?"
"204987124-0-83487";"There's still time to stop at a tavern before we go to Marbruk."
"204987124-0-83488";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-83489";"Wisteria is the traitor. Has it gotten any easier?"
"204987124-0-83490";"Do you still enjoy traveling together?"
"204987124-0-83491";"What changed?"
"204987124-0-83492";"How do you feel about your tattoos now?"
"204987124-0-83493";"Wisteria is the traitor. Has it gotten any easier?"
"204987124-0-83494";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-83495";"You think their goal is to replace the Proxy Queen with one of their own?"
"204987124-0-83497";"Do you want a look at that journal entry I found near Echo Pond?"
"204987124-0-83501";"You think they'll strike again?"
"204987124-0-83503";"Where would you go?"
"204987124-0-83505";"What's next?"
"204987124-0-83507";"If you're spies, have you ever worked with the Eyes of the Queen?"
"204987124-0-83508";"I've worked with the Eyes in the past."
"204987124-0-83509";"So the leaders of the Ceythalmor are a part of this Thalmor group?"
"204987124-0-83510";"You were a thief before you joined the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83511";"If you're spies, have you ever worked with the Eyes of the Queen?"
"204987124-0-83512";"If you're spies, have you ever worked with the Eyes of the Queen?"
"204987124-0-83514";"How did you become a spy?"
"204987124-0-83515";"If you're spies, have you ever worked with the Eyes of the Queen?"
"204987124-0-83516";"What happened?"
"204987124-0-83517";"That reminds me of the Veiled Heritance."
"204987124-0-83518";"You were a thief before you joined the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83533";"How does a prophecy change?"
"204987124-0-83536";"Do you know anything else about Orpheon the Tactician?"
"204987124-0-83537";"Do you know anything else about Orpheon the Tactician?"
"204987124-0-83539";"How do you know so much about Elder Scrolls?"
"204987124-0-83540";"Do you know anything else about Orpheon the Tactician?"
"204987124-0-83542";"How did he overrun Lep Seclusa so quickly?"
"204987124-0-83543";"How large is Orpheon's army?"
"204987124-0-83544";"If the Elder Scroll's prophecy isn't about the Ruby throne, what is it about?"
"204987124-0-83545";"You know how to beat the Sword-singers?"
"204987124-0-83552";"Have you always lived on Lep Seclusa?"
"204987124-0-83553";"Have you always lived on Lep Seclusa?"
"204987124-0-83554";"There are hidden passages in this island? Where do they lead?"
"204987124-0-83555";"Why are there many tunnels and passageways here?"
"204987124-0-83556";"Tell me about the Hel Netu."
"204987124-0-83557";"Tell me about the Hel Netu."
"204987124-0-83558";"Why not take Sister Chana with you?"
"204987124-0-83562";"We'll head to Skywatch and see if we can find Snapdragon."
"204987124-0-83563";"Why did Snapdragon leave the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83564";"Why did you found the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83565";"Why did Snapdragon leave the Garland Ring?"
"204987124-0-83566";"How can you afford to do all of this?"
"204987124-0-83567";"What kind of change?"
"204987124-0-83569";"Who's this group you're worried about?"
"204987124-0-83574";"What do you need me to do?"
"204987124-0-83582";"All right. I'll wait for Tanlorin to cast their spell."
"204987124-0-83583";"Your magic reminds you of your family?"
"204987124-0-83584";"How is this related to your tattoos?"
"204987124-0-83585";"Deep magic?"
"204987124-0-83586";"Your magic reminds you of your family?"
"204987124-0-83587";"What did you learn about the soul reaper Merric destroyed?"
"204987124-0-83588";"Your magic reminds you of your family?"
"204987124-0-83606";"What about Wisteria?"
"204987124-0-83608";"I'm with you, Tanlorin."
"204987124-0-83624";"A hidden nest? Where?"
"204987124-0-83629";"You want to stay here with the Elder Scroll?"
"204987124-0-83630";"What was on the scroll?"
"204987124-0-83631";"You'd leave your home?"
"204987124-0-83632";"What about Sister Chana and the Elder Scroll?"
"204987124-0-83636";"You think the Ceythalmor know about the greenhouses?"
"204987124-0-83638";"You think this paper contains a hidden message? So how do we make pigmented oil?"
"204987124-0-83639";"Clever."
"204987124-0-83640";"How did Hyacinth capture that moment on the disk?"
"204987124-0-83642";"You know Wisteria might be the traitor, right?"
"204987124-0-83650";"Still no word from High Cantor Viti or Cantor Krin'ze?"
"204987124-0-83651";"Why would the moonclaw lead you there?"
"204987124-0-83652";"Remind me what happened at the shrine to Namiira."
"204987124-0-83653";"What should I know about Khenarthi's Rise?"
"204987124-0-83654";"Why didn't Moon-Singer Talbira's song work, Zerith?"
"204987124-0-83655";"Maybe we can beat her without the song."
"204987124-0-83656";"What should I know about Khenarthi's Rise?"
"204987124-0-83657";"What happens if Ravith-morna successfully summons the moon beast?"
"204987124-0-83665";"We dealt with the Ceythalmor before. We can do it again."
"204987124-0-83673";"Other Moth Priests?"
"204987124-0-83676";"How will we get to the upper monastery if the gate is destroyed?"
"204987124-0-83701";"You want to go to the other locations in Snapdragon's journal."
"204987124-0-83702";"Why do you think Wisteria brought this out of you?"
"204987124-0-83703";"Right. Let's go find Hyacinth and the Gardener."
"204987124-0-83704";"Right. Let's go find Hyacinth and the Gardener."
"204987124-0-83731";"The group that attacked you call themselves the Ceythalmor."
"204987124-0-83733";"You're welcome, your majesty."
"204987124-0-83734";"The Garland Ring tries to do what's best for the people of Summerset."
"204987124-0-83735";"That's a big change."
"204987124-0-83749";"All right, we'll head back to your greenhouse."
"204987124-0-83956";"Any thoughts about the soul reapers?"
"204987124-0-83957";"And you can appoint one of them as the leader of the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-83981";"What about Merric of the Fighters Guild? Have you seen him?"
"204987124-0-83983";"So Merric must be on his way to Shornhelm."
"204987124-0-83991";"She told Merric that someone who looked like her took the coach to Shornhelm. He went after it."
"204987124-0-84059";"Skordo, focus. Here's Merric's sword and shield. Gabrielle took care of his body."
"204987124-0-84061";"We learned that there's a Worm Nest close by, on the coast of northern Rivenspire."
"204987124-0-84115";"What's in the upper monastery?"
"204987124-0-84116";"The note could have been left there as a trap."
"204987124-0-84137";"The reapers steal souls. The cult has enough to cover Tamriel. As for Vanus, Mezamma captured him."
"204987124-0-84156";"Where did the reports say Merric was spotted again?"
"204987124-0-84315";"You said Guildmaster Merric has disappeared?"
"204987124-0-84317";"I'm in. Let's find Merric and stop the attacks on the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-84318";"What do you mean, Merric has disappeared?"
"204987124-0-84319";"I'm in. Let's find Guildmaster Merric and stop the attacks on the Fighters Guild."
"204987124-0-84395";"I changed my mind about the mistscrub leaves."
"204987124-0-84440";"Four Fighters Guildhalls were destroyed, Merric was killed, and Vanus Galerion has been captured."
"204987124-0-84444";"Four Fighters Guildhalls were destroyed, Merric was killed, and Vanus Galerion has been captured."
"204987124-0-84446";"Four Fighters Guildhalls were destroyed, Merric was killed, and Vanus Galerion has been captured."
"204987124-0-84451";"And now the guildmaster is heading to the Shornhelm Mages Guild."
"204987124-0-84463";"Have you been to Solstice?"
"204987124-0-84464";"Do you still support Prince Azah's leadership of the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-84598";"Sounds likely. I'll go search in Malabal Tor."
"204987124-0-84599";"I'll go search in the Alik'r Desert."
"204987124-0-84600";"It's as good a place to look as any. I'll go search in Eastmarch."
"204987124-0-84634";"Care to tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-84635";"Why the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-84636";"Tell me about Guildmaster Merric."
"204987124-0-84637";"Why the Fighters Guild?"
"204987124-0-84638";"How did he become guildmaster?"
"204987124-0-84639";"And now Merric's missing?"
"204987124-0-84640";"And now Merric's missing?"
"204987124-0-84641";"Care to tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-84642";"What do you mean?"
"204987124-0-84643";"Care to tell me about yourself?"
"204987124-0-84644";"How could that happen?"
"204987124-0-84652";"The cultist said their leader had business with a Magister Andrelo at the Tall Trunk Tavern."
"204987124-0-84653";"All right. I'll meet you outside after I talk to the magister."
"204987124-0-84654";"All right. I'll meet you outside after I talk to the magister."
"204987124-0-84655";"All right. I'll meet you outside after I talk to the magister."
"204987124-0-84657";"What stopped the Planemeld?"
"204987124-0-84663";"But the Worm Cult survived?"
"204987124-0-84667";"So, how are they still around?"
"204987124-0-84685";"The dark divinations referred to Molag Bal?"
"204987124-0-84723";"Oh very well. I'll get you the mistscrub leaves."
"204987124-0-84755";"All right. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-84756";"All right. What do you need?"
"204987124-0-84757";"So where's Guildmaster Merric now?"
"204987124-0-84758";"So where's Guildmaster Merric now?"
"204987124-0-84759";"So where's Guildmaster Merric now?"
"204987124-0-84770";"The magister let slip that the Mages Guild is having some sort of meeting there."
"204987124-0-84773";"Yes you do. Guildmaster Merric taught you well, didn't he?"
"204987124-0-84774";"Of course, Prince Azah."
"204987124-0-84775";"Do we know anything about Mezamma?"
"204987124-0-84776";"Who's the other person you're going to go collect?"
"204987124-0-84778";"Do we know anything specific about this Worm Cult nest?"
"204987124-0-84779";"On the northern coast of Rivenspire, in a cove near the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-84780";"On the northern coast of Rivenspire, in a cove near the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-84781";"On the northern coast of Rivenspire, in a cove near the lighthouse."
"204987124-0-84795";"We need to find a way, Skordo"
"204987124-0-84803";"And what have you found out?"
"204987124-0-84805";"And what have you found out?"
"204987124-0-84807";"And what have you found out?"
"204987124-0-84808";"Do anything interesting since the last time we ran into each other?"
"204987124-0-84809";"Do you know anything more about the attacks on the guildhalls?"
"204987124-0-84819";"Sounds like you care about the guildmaster."
"204987124-0-84820";"Sounds like you care about the guildmaster."
"204987124-0-84821";"Tell me about Guildmaster Merric."
"204987124-0-84903";"Here's your mistscrub."
"204987124-0-84904";"Here's your mistscrub."
"204987124-0-84905";"Here's your mistscrub."
"204987124-0-84906";"I changed my mind about the mistscrub leaves."
"204987124-0-84919";"Right. I'll meet you in Shornhelm."
"204987124-0-84926";"Of course, Prince Azah."
"204987124-0-84927";"Of course, Prince Azah."
"204987124-0-84935";"I'll help you destroy the Worm Cult nest and defeat Mezamma."
"204987124-0-84936";"What do the reports from Malabal Tor say?"
"204987124-0-84937";"What do the reports from Malabal Tor say?"
"204987124-0-84938";"What do the reports from Malabal Tor say?"
"204987124-0-84940";"What other business do you have with Prince Azah and Skordo?"
"204987124-0-84945";"What other business do you have with Prince Azah and Skordo?"
"204987124-0-84946";"You're the leader of the Mages Guild?"
"204987124-0-84948";"Mezamma took Skordo's form and said ""First the Mages' head. Next the Fighters' heart"" as she left."
"204987124-0-84949";"What's the Earth Forge?"
"204987124-0-84950";"How do you want to proceed?"
"204987124-0-84952";"All right, I'll talk to my alliance's ambassador on Stirk."
"204987124-0-84958";"Any thoughts on the fellowship or Vanus's imprisonment?"
"204987124-0-84974";"I assumed the Stirk Fellowship was all set."
"204987124-0-84976";"How are you going to locate the island of Solstice?"
"204987124-0-84977";"I assumed the Stirk Fellowship was all set."
"204987124-0-84978";"I assumed the Stirk Fellowship was all set."
"204987124-1-26";"Has your sister ever met a moose?"
"204987124-1-38";"I tire of shedding Insurgent blood.  Hand over your army's plans and I will leave you in peace."
"204987124-1-39";"Your security is pitiful - reaching you was effortless.  Now, hand over your plans."
"204987124-1-41";"(Ask about his background)"
"204987124-1-63";"We'll let it slide, this one time - but tell me. Where are your parents?"
"204987124-1-101";"Why would Averos want to kill King Ranser?"
"204987124-1-112";"Who is Countess Virolynn?"
"204987124-1-125";"Where is this ritual?"
"204987124-1-135";"I'll ask you again. Where is the ritual site?"
"204987124-1-139";"Who is Oron?"
"204987124-1-140";"Who is Oron?"
"204987124-1-142";"Where is Oron"
"204987124-1-144";"Who is Oron, again?"
"204987124-1-146";"Can you tell me who was murdered, again?"
"204987124-1-164";"It happens to everyone. You'll be ready, next time."
"204987124-1-167";"You can't leave. Northmoor needs every soldier she has. Learn to master your fear."
"204987124-1-181";"Why was Lord Ranser in Camlorn?"
"204987124-1-200";"What do you know of this town?"
"204987124-1-203";"What do you know of this town?"
"204987124-1-206";"What do you know of this town?"
"204987124-1-215";"Have you been poisoning farmland in the area?"
"204987124-1-220";"Did you know that Khalisah has feelings for you?"
"204987124-1-222";"Then you want me to give the necklace to Guendeline?"
"204987124-1-225";"I think you should give Khalisah a chance."
"204987124-1-232";"You're right. I'll leave it alone for now."
"204987124-1-236";"I must speak to the others first."
"204987124-1-241";"I must speak to the others first."
"204987124-1-245";"I must speak to the others first."
"204987124-1-262";"What Julien thinks is unimportant. What do you intend to do?"
"204987124-1-282";"Countess Virolynn was convinced that her Chamberlain was headed there."
"204987124-1-283";"What happened to the man who attacked you?"
"204987124-1-285";"What happened to the man who attacked you?"
"204987124-1-286";"What did you do then?"
"204987124-1-297";"Before I make a decision, I should speak with King Sebastien and see if he has greater need."
"204987124-1-301";"Oron may need my help. I must talk to him before agreeing to anything."
"204987124-1-307";"Sit for a moment and regain  your strength... and tell me what happened to your family."
"204987124-1-353";"Where is Inquisitor Danain?"

"204987124-1-455";"What is the Magis Order?"
"204987124-1-456";"Can you prove Averos is guilty?"
"204987124-1-457";"Why would Averos want to kill Lord Ranser?"
"204987124-1-496";"I should stay here and help heal Virolynn instead."
"204987124-1-499";"She's in your hands. I must slay Gargast before he reaches Dwynnen."
"204987124-1-566";"Tell me any old joke."
"204987124-1-606";"Who is Baron Winoc?"
"204987124-1-609";"Can you prove Averos is guilty?"
"204987124-1-611";"Can you prove Averos is guilty?"
"204987124-1-619";"Who are the Hands of Northmoor?"
"204987124-1-628";"The Courier escaped before I could speak with him."
"204987124-1-638";"What old feuds?"
"204987124-1-677";"No. I've other business to attend to first."
"204987124-1-711";"Tell me about King Sebastien."
"204987124-1-1231";"What woman do you speak of?"
"204987124-1-1284";"I will NOT give you the tome"
"204987124-1-1356";"Can I get another box?"
"204987124-1-1357";"How do you know Rolantae?"

"204987124-1-1414";"A Knight"
"204987124-1-1451";"I can't tell you. I don't think killing the captives is the answer."
"204987124-1-1471";"I'm not runing errands for you. In fact, I could tell the duke you're withholding evidence."
"204987124-1-1481";"Tell me about the missing Apprentices."
"204987124-1-1485";"James Tailas sent me."
"204987124-1-1488";"I won't do your dirty work."

"204987124-1-1585";"What is a dro-m'Athra?"
"204987124-1-1587";"Why do you think the dro'm-Athra haunt you?"
"204987124-1-1594";"I will return if I think of a way to help."
"204987124-1-1630";"Tell me more about this Moonbird."
"204987124-1-1638";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-1-1654";"I am a powerful warrior. I can complete any task you need."
"204987124-1-1658";"I am not interested in a trade."
"204987124-1-1659";"I'm not ready to escape just yet."
"204987124-1-1663";"I'm not ready to return to Pariah Abbey just yet."
"204987124-1-1680";"Sir Hughes isn't responsible for his crimes."
"204987124-1-1698";"I'll start looking in Baelbrone."
"204987124-1-1727";"I will save Ahtah's Book of Circles."
"204987124-1-1817";"[TAUNT] Shut your ugly muzzle, cat-man. You know what? Your fur... smells!"
"204987124-1-1846";"No, I can't let you go. You have to die."
"204987124-1-1869";"She implied there might have been something between you."
"204987124-1-1888";"start the CTF please"
"204987124-1-1889";"What protections does the Claw have?"
"204987124-1-1930";"Umm no.. I just decided to look around."
"204987124-1-1985";"[LIE] I have news from Orsinium, your wife has fallen ill."
"204987124-1-1987";"What do you mean by that?"
"204987124-1-2063";"Tell me more about Arkay."
"204987124-1-2073";"Why were you going to Fell's Run?"
"204987124-1-2093";"Meh"
"204987124-1-2106";"She was torn apart and used to create an abomination of living flesh."
"204987124-1-2158";"Yes, I'll take a kitten."

"204987124-1-23739";"You're too weak to do this hunt. Drop out!"
"204987124-1-23741";"Are you sure? It seems very dangerous out here. Perhaps you should go home."
"204987124-1-23743";"I think you should consider how dangerous it can be out here in the wilds."
"204987124-1-23744";"Wait, haven't you considered how dangerous it is out here? Anything could happen."

"204987124-1-24212";"You have some new crewmembers?"
"204987124-1-24214";"You've convinced me. Take the Fangs."
"204987124-1-24215";"Who is the Night Mother?"
"204987124-1-24220";"Why shouldn't I keep the Fangs? I recovered them."

"204987124-1-24245";"I'll take care of the spriggan matron."
"204987124-1-24254";"No, I'm going to follow the Dremora's plan."
"204987124-1-24258";"[Lie] I don't know anyone named <<1>>."

"204987124-1-24261";"You deserved your punishment. You must remain."
"204987124-1-24262";"Then you are rightly condemned and will remain here."

"204987124-1-24305";"I've found a few books in my travels already."
"204987124-1-24315";"Why does it have to be this way? Why does the Dark Mane have to be contained?"
"204987124-1-24329";"I may help you, but I'm not your servant."
"204987124-1-24331";"Why Hammerfell?"

"204987124-1-24395";"You mentioned someone named Skordo?"
"204987124-1-24398";"Do you know why they call this hole in the ground the Tower of Lies?"
"204987124-1-24402";"How did you get this way?"
"204987124-1-24406";"How did you get this way?"
"204987124-1-24411";"If you expect me to volunteer, you're going to have a fight on your hands."
"204987124-1-24413";"What do you think it is?"
"204987124-1-24414";"What is this place?"
"204987124-1-24415";"What is this place?"
"204987124-1-24418";"Have you been hiding anything else?"

"204987124-1-24496";"Any idea what causes the confusion?"
"204987124-1-24497";"I don't have time for this. Just tell me what I need to know."
"204987124-1-24498";"I'm not sure drinking that is such a good idea."
"204987124-1-24501";"I'll head up to the next level."
"204987124-1-24502";"Who should I look for when I get up there?"
"204987124-1-24508";"Maybe some other time."
"204987124-1-24511";"How did you escape from being locked up?"

"204987124-1-24569";"Why do you want me to run in the race?"
"204987124-1-24578";"What do you have in mind?"
"204987124-1-24580";"Your duty is to <<1>>."

"204987124-1-24591";"Sorry, I've changed my mind."
"204987124-1-24592";"Sorry, I've changed my mind."
"204987124-1-24625";"But surely the Alik'r has faced undead in the past?"
"204987124-1-24627";"Where did the superstitions come from?"
"204987124-1-24632";"I want to know more about the Mnemic Egg."
"204987124-1-24644";"How can you help me?"
"204987124-1-24647";"<<1>> would vouch for my courage."

"204987124-1-24724";"You mentioned enemies. What did you mean?"
"204987124-1-24725";"Can you remind me … you mentioned a crystal?"
"204987124-1-24731";"Where are you taking me?"
"204987124-1-24732";"Did you help Merric research what we found?"

"204987124-1-24771";"Tell me what magic your king plans, or I will hurt you."
"204987124-1-24774";"If you truly want to end this, tell me what magic your king plots."

"204987124-1-24840";"Has anyone that ventured into the mist returned?"
"204987124-1-24841";"I should talk to Xohaneel before I make my decision."

"204987124-1-32099";"You fought in the war against the Black Drake?"
"204987124-1-32102";"What can I do to help now?"
"204987124-1-32104";"So the Reachmen attacked, and you came to the village's aid?"
"204987124-1-32108";"If you don't convince him, you're dead."
"204987124-1-32134";"Tell me more about the Maulborn."
"204987124-1-32141";"What are you expecting me to find?"

"204987124-1-32514";"<<1>>?"
"204987124-1-32529";"<<1>> took him to the Shivering Isles."
"204987124-1-32548";"Will you return to <<c:1>>?"

"204987124-1-32636";"Trinkets don't make a good soldier, courage does. You made it through the battle on your own merits."
"204987124-1-32638";"I'm sorry the constable betrayed the town."
"204987124-1-32646";"So you'd rather stay a werewolf?"
"204987124-1-32647";"Tell me about your family."
"204987124-1-32648";"Do you really have children?"

"204987124-1-32655";"How'd the Imperials catch you?"
"204987124-1-32656";"Being a bandit isn't a solution, there are other options."
"204987124-1-32657";"I won't deny that I enjoy the fight."
"204987124-1-32658";"I won't deny that I enjoy the fight."
"204987124-1-32662";"You chose banditry over living in a stronghold?"

"204987124-1-32676";"How did she find you?"
"204987124-1-32681";"How would I destroy the bud?"

"204987124-1-32686";"How do we finish the ritual?"
"204987124-1-32687";"He's waiting for me by the eastern mine entrance."
"204987124-1-32694";"Why should I help you?"
"204987124-1-32696";"But why do you need help?"
"204987124-1-32697";"Only if you need it."
"204987124-1-32702";"Tell me about the Camoran War."
"204987124-1-32707";"What is this place?"
"204987124-1-32729";"As you say, Sai."

"204987124-1-32752";"Is there any way to help?"
"204987124-1-32754";"If I help you, how do I know you won't buy skooma for him?"
"204987124-1-32756";"What happened to your arm?"
"204987124-1-32758";"Bandits burned your farm?"
"204987124-1-32761";"What's wrong?"
"204987124-1-32762";"Why is that?"
"204987124-1-32763";"And he won?"
"204987124-1-32764";"<Give him a package of <<1>>.>"
"204987124-1-32765";"I only did what Leila asked. She was worried about you!"
"204987124-1-32780";"Who exactly are you?"

"204987124-1-32796";"Who exactly are you?"
"204987124-1-32800";"What is the ""Orc's Finger""?"
"204987124-1-32803";"What did Reynelle do?"
"204987124-1-32804";"The Architect mentioned you destroyed his works before."
"204987124-1-32805";"The Architect mentioned you destroyed his works before."
"204987124-1-32809";"Do what you must, Lyris."
"204987124-1-32811";"I will not condemn you to torture. You are free."
"204987124-1-32813";"I will not condemn you."
"204987124-1-32814";"On second thought, your past deeds were horrible and you should be punished."
"204987124-1-32826";"Are you two married?"
"204987124-1-32848";"What do you think we're going to find here?"
"204987124-1-32850";"Explain how the veil works again."
"204987124-1-32861";"Why not keep them for ourselves?"
"204987124-1-32877";"I was just covering for him."
"204987124-1-32890";"<<1>> needs it for her ratification ceremony."
"204987124-1-32896";"[Lie] She died protecting her soldiers."
"204987124-1-32910";"Who is Duraeg of the Dark Witnesses?"
"204987124-1-32918";"Why would destroying the circlet kill you?"
"204987124-1-32933";"Are you certain that Lleraya commands the troops at Northpoint?"
"204987124-1-32941";"I'll kill him."
"204987124-1-32957";"Can I do anything to help?"
"204987124-1-32972";"Our mission in Mathiisen."
"204987124-1-32973";"The work we did in Greenshade. That was interesting."
"204987124-1-32974";"Woodhearth was quite the adventure, right?"
"204987124-1-32991";"I guess there's nothing more to say then."
"204987124-1-32992";"That business in Vulkhel Guard."
"204987124-1-32993";"That business in Vulkhel Guard."
"204987124-1-32994";"The mission in Skywatch."
"204987124-1-32995";"I was thinking of the Seaside Sanctuary."
"204987124-1-32996";"I was thinking of the Seaside Sanctuary."
"204987124-1-32997";"How can I forget Hectahame?"
"204987124-1-32999";"What have you learned so far?"
"204987124-1-33000";"Stop crying and pull yourself together. We need you."
"204987124-1-33015";"How sick is Laetille?"
"204987124-1-33017";"Every opinion helps us see things more clearly."
"204987124-1-33032";"What else can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-1-33066";"What does this rune do?"
"204987124-1-33067";"Do you really believe there is no cure?"
"204987124-1-33068";"Who are the Blacksap's leaders?"
"204987124-1-33070";"Are you all right?"
"204987124-1-33074";"What was he doing to you?"
"204987124-1-33077";"What was he doing to you?"
"204987124-1-33084";"That business on Khenarthi's Roost?"
"204987124-1-33103";"Sounds like this is a personal thing."
"204987124-1-33112";"The bandits pay you?"
"204987124-1-33120";"Why are you holding <<1>> here?"
"204987124-1-33121";"Why can't the Dominion handle this?"
"204987124-1-33122";"Baron Dorell should rule."
"204987124-1-33123";"Where are we exactly?"
"204987124-1-33127";"No. I really think Baron Dorell should rule."
"204987124-1-33129";"No. I really think Countess Tamrith should rule."
"204987124-1-33131";"Where are the Orc's Finger Ruins?"
"204987124-1-33143";"Sounds like you really wanted to be the king."
"204987124-1-33144";"Why do you want me to capture your sons?"
"204987124-1-33145";"The Remnant must be destroyed."
"204987124-1-33151";"Tell me more about the relic, spirit."
"204987124-1-33157";"Not yet."
"204987124-1-33168";"Let me catch my breath."
"204987124-1-33172";"What did Graccus want from you?"
"204987124-1-33173";"Why don't you help me retrieve the Tear?"
"204987124-1-33177";"If I bring back the relic, how will you get credit?"
"204987124-1-33178";"What can you tell me about the Tear of Anurraame?"
"204987124-1-33179";"What can you tell me about the Tear of Anurraame?"

"204987124-1-33237";"Are you staying in Shornhelm?"
"204987124-1-33255";"Why do the knights even have a camp here?"
"204987124-1-33272";"What are these ruins?"
"204987124-1-33273";"You said the Oghma Infinium would be mine."
"204987124-1-33277";"Lady Laurent?"
"204987124-1-33280";"So what is this place?"
"204987124-1-33281";"Stibbons … is that you?"
"204987124-1-33289";"Rainy skies bring all the peepers out."
"204987124-1-33307";"Once green, it broke the Green Pact. Y'ffre's anger turned it red."
"204987124-1-33357";"I will."
"204987124-1-33362";"Who is Countess Tamrith?"
"204987124-1-33363";"Who are you again?"
"204987124-1-33364";"I'll open the cell."
"204987124-1-33376";"Maybe the Shornhelm guards will take care of it?"
"204987124-1-33397";"You could go to Cyrodiil."
"204987124-1-33404";"Let's go find Gwendis and the others."
"204987124-1-33408";"Where is this group?"
"204987124-1-33411";"Where is this group?"
"204987124-1-33412";"Where is this group?"
"204987124-1-33413";"Maybe she'll join you?"
"204987124-1-33417";"Why were you going there?"
"204987124-1-33426";"Why has it been delayed?"
"204987124-1-33427";"Why did <<1>> offer to build the Khajiit an embassy?"
"204987124-1-33445";"Let me think about this."
"204987124-1-33448";"Let me think about this."
"204987124-1-33452";"Let me think about this."
"204987124-1-33468";"How long has <<1>> been like this?"
"204987124-1-33484";"If you don't step aside, you're going to have an emergency."
"204987124-1-33521";"What else can you tell me about <<1>>?"
"204987124-1-33522";"What can you tell me about your hirelings?"

"204987124-1-33528";"I just want to know who's behind this."
"204987124-1-33531";"I have to take care of some things here first."
"204987124-1-33536";"Do you know which of your ancestors are buried here?"
"204987124-1-33537";"Do you know which of your ancestors are buried here?"
"204987124-1-33538";"Should you send word to the queen that you're alive?"
"204987124-1-33552";"Do what you think is best."
"204987124-1-33568";"The silver dagger worked."
"204987124-1-33572";"He did what he set out to do. He saved Rivenspire."
"204987124-1-33576";"Actually, don't call in the Thalmor. Allow the Hollow Moon to continue its operations in Redfur."
"204987124-1-33577";"Gold and glory."
"204987124-1-33628";"Is Irnand all right?"
"204987124-1-33633";"Is there a way to turn you back?"

"204987124-1-33653";"Tell me how to stop the constructs."
"204987124-1-33655";"Your father still lives. I can bring you to him."
"204987124-1-33687";"What should I do now?"
"204987124-1-33693";"The rotten egg did nothing."
"204987124-1-33695";"The rotten egg did nothing."
"204987124-1-33703";"I'm sorry. But he sent a bag of coins along with me. I hope this will help."
"204987124-1-33705";"I'm sorry. But, he sent a bag of gold along with me. I hope this will help."
"204987124-1-33708";"Klaandor says it will be some time before he can return to Shornhelm. He sent this amulet. [Lie]"
"204987124-1-33715";"[Lie] Yenadar wanted me to tell you he was sorry. He's gone abroad to preach of Jode's light."
"204987124-1-33730";"Where is this place?"
"204987124-1-33742";"Kicking the corpse with silver boots didn't keep it from turning into a bloodfiend."
"204987124-1-33749";"Is this an Imperial mine?"
"204987124-1-33751";"Enough questions. I'd better hurry and free your friend."
"204987124-1-33752";"Enough questions. I'd better hurry and free your friend."
"204987124-1-33761";"Consecrating the corpse with holy water worked."
"204987124-1-33763";"Where did the Imperials come from?"
"204987124-1-33764";"So the Baandari are helping defend the camp?"
"204987124-1-33767";"Why do the knights even have a camp here?"

"204987124-1-41197";"Don't try to hide behind your dead husband."
"204987124-1-41198";"On second thought, exile is too extreme. I'll cover the blood price."

"204987124-1-50202";"Darien Gautier from Coldharbour? He's your vessel?"
"204987124-1-50212";"What does a cleansing crystal do?"
"204987124-1-50215";"I'm a vampire."
"204987124-1-50227";"Who are these cultists who were chasing you? Do they serve Clavicus Vile?"
"204987124-1-50249";"I better find that elixir the Ritemaster requested."
"204987124-1-50250";"I better find that elixir the Ritemaster requested."
"204987124-1-50251";"How did a non-High Elf end up in the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-1-50252";"Can't you use magic to summon the component you need?"
"204987124-1-50255";"There was a prophecy about Summerset, Artaeum, and three dark princes."

"204987124-1-50293";"Can I ask you about your … enhancements?"
"204987124-1-50298";"Why haven't you looked into this matter yourself?"
"204987124-1-50304";"You're right. Let's get out of here."
"204987124-1-50312";"Mischief."
"204987124-1-50315";"Mischief."
"204987124-1-50319";"For."
"204987124-1-50323";"Mischief."
"204987124-1-50329";"Why haven't you looked into this matter more thoroughly yourself?"
"204987124-1-50338";"How do you know your brother is here in Rellenthil?"
"204987124-1-50340";"Can you tell me more about the audition process?"
"204987124-1-50342";"Can you tell me more about the audition process?"
"204987124-1-50349";"What does a sponsor do, exactly?"
"204987124-1-50351";"I'd expect an Undaunted to be more eager for a fight."
"204987124-1-50357";"It looks like there are Dwemer ruins here."

"204987124-1-50405";"Today you will witness a show unlike any other!"
"204987124-1-50407";"One wrong move, one ill-timed swallow, and that blade will cut right through her heart!"
"204987124-1-50408";"One wrong move, one ill-timed swallow, and that blade will cut right through her heart!"
"204987124-1-50409";"One wrong move, one ill-timed swallow, and that blade will cut right through her heart!"
"204987124-1-50410";"And yet she makes that dangerous blade look no more dangerous than a soft carrot! Amazing!"

"204987124-1-50452";"Yes, I believe Larydel is Feathermoth."
"204987124-1-50455";"No. I believe you're Larydel in disguise."
"204987124-1-50465";"I believe he's Clever."
"204987124-1-50470";"I better find that elixir the Ritemaster requested."
"204987124-1-50491";"If you're worried she won't leave, let her join the Sapiarchs, then tell her."

"204987124-1-50563";"What's an Undaunted?"
"204987124-1-50565";"It was Thurvokun's old Dragon Priest. I've already dealt with her."
"204987124-1-50573";"Any objection to us investigating the sinkhole?"
"204987124-1-50581";"I'll take comfort in the fact that wherever you end up, you'll be miserable."
"204987124-1-50583";"How long has the acropolis been this way?"
"204987124-1-50584";"Why would a clan of our fellow High Elves leave Summerset to settle in High Rock?"
"204987124-1-50589";"Fate didn't smile on them. I saw what happened to Thurvokun's Dragon Priest at Scalecaller Peak."
"204987124-1-50603";"Just how illegal is what we're about to do?"
"204987124-1-50632";"The evidence points to her being involved with the Court of Bedlam."
"204987124-1-50635";"What's your next move?"
"204987124-1-50637";"Why are you so interested in the situation here? Are you a vigilante or something?"
"204987124-1-50693";"Does this have something to do with the Court of Bedlam?"
"204987124-1-50694";"Could this be the source of the abyssal pearls?"

"204987124-1-50707";"[Lie] Of course! I don't even worship Daedra."
"204987124-1-50723";"I'm interested. What are the details?"
"204987124-1-50726";"Conservation is important. I'll spare the plant."
"204987124-1-50730";"All right, I accept your offer."
"204987124-1-50759";"Can you tell me about Tindoria and Vaerelel's relationship?"
"204987124-1-50765";"If you're paying double, I'll take that deal."
"204987124-1-50770";"This may be the last aurialis plant on Summerset. You may not be able to find anymore."
"204987124-1-50787";"What is the Conclave of the Eleven Forces?"
"204987124-1-50788";"We'll get to the bottom of this."
"204987124-1-50795";"They want you to find the Heart of Transparent Law. I think the earl told me the truth."
"204987124-1-50800";"Why were you so hard on Oriandra?"
"204987124-1-50809";"Not yet. I need to take care of something else first."
"204987124-1-50846";"The Maormer attack occurred because Pandermalion was consorting with their captain."
"204987124-1-50852";"Tell me more about this plague."
"204987124-1-50860";"You know, I once defeated an undead Dragon in Fang Lair."
"204987124-1-50869";"And the cultists here are creating a plague?"
"204987124-1-50872";"What should I know about Lodiss?"
"204987124-1-50879";"What was Ludovic like?"
"204987124-1-50880";"What was Ludovic like?"
"204987124-1-50881";"What should I know about Lodiss?"
"204987124-1-50891";"If your son is involved he could be in danger. I only want to help him."
"204987124-1-50931";"This is related to what happened in Clockwork City, isn't it? You have to tell me."
"204987124-1-50938";"We need to know what the Princes were originally planning."
"204987124-1-50951";"How long has the acropolis been this way?"
"204987124-1-50959";"What will happen if I light the brazier?"
"204987124-1-50967";"Your idea seems like the best option. Have the Psijics figure out how to use the diamond keys."
"204987124-1-50978";"Tell me about Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-1-50982";"Dibella's Bosom Night Favor might help spark Enigma's acting muse."
"204987124-1-50986";"Dibella's Bosom Night Favor might help spark Enigma's acting muse."
"204987124-1-50987";"I think Essence of Mammoth would be perfect for inspiring Enigma's performance."

"204987124-1-50993";"Aren't there other keepers who could help us?"
"204987124-1-50995";"Tell me about Essence of Mammoth."
"204987124-1-50996";"Tell me about the Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-1-50997";"Tell me about the Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-1-51006";"I think Tableau is capable of making her own choice. Why can't you respect that?"
"204987124-1-51013";"How can you complain that he's not respecting your wishes, when you refuse to respect his?"
"204987124-1-51049";"I helped resolve the issue between the Mages Guild and the Sapiarchs."
"204987124-1-51052";"Can you tell me more about these cultists and their plague?"
"204987124-1-51053";"I wouldn't stake my career on something this controversial."
"204987124-1-51058";"She's still a junior keeper after ten years?"
"204987124-1-51065";"What were you and your friend talking about before I arrived?"
"204987124-1-51070";"Maybe the Justiciar would appreciate Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-1-51071";"Maybe the Justiciar would appreciate Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-1-51072";"Essence of Mammoth might be exactly the right gift for Justiciar Rolumdel."
"204987124-1-51073";"Maybe the Justiciar would appreciate Dibella's Bosom Night Favor."
"204987124-1-51076";"I think Dibella's Bosom Night Favor would make the perfect gift for the Sapiarch."
"204987124-1-51077";"Essence of Mammoth might be exactly the right gift for the Sapiarch."
"204987124-1-51078";"Maybe the Sapiarch would appreciate your Depressing Stuffed Goat."
"204987124-1-51079";"I think Dibella's Bosom Night Favor would make the perfect gift for the Sapiarch."
"204987124-1-51092";"Why didn't you bring an escort?"
"204987124-1-51096";"Unless you want me to report you to the Divine Prosecution, let me have the aojee-sakka."
"204987124-1-51097";"That's too rich for my blood. Any chance you can just give me the item?"
"204987124-1-51098";"There must be some way I can convince you to give me your Khajiit navigation stone."
"204987124-1-51109";"[Help Jorvuld] I have an item that may help you."
"204987124-1-51129";"Tell me more about Hannayel and Imedril."
"204987124-1-51139";"Is there anyone else who might shed light on the murder?"
"204987124-1-51165";"Aren't there other keepers who could help us?"
"204987124-1-51184";"Remind me, who's Meridia again?"
"204987124-1-51200";"What do you mean when you say they're up to no good?"
"204987124-1-51230";"No, I won't take your life. Give me the ring and we'll be done with this."
"204987124-1-51233";"Why did the Oracle's message make you uneasy?"
"204987124-1-51246";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"204987124-1-51283";"You saw Haladan's body. What do you think happened to him?"
"204987124-1-51307";"So Emile would sacrifice himself to protect Haladan's memory?"
"204987124-1-51317";"No."
"204987124-1-51322";"Can you remind me what our Altmer dueling customs entail?"
"204987124-1-51323";"I'll pass."
"204987124-1-51328";"Why did he want you to leave?"
"204987124-1-51335";"So Emile would sacrifice himself to protect Haladan's memory?"
"204987124-1-51338";"Is this why you didn't hire more soldiers?"
"204987124-1-51339";"Tell me about this affliction Emile and Haladan were treating."
"204987124-1-51388";"What happened in here?"
"204987124-1-51402";"Rhanul? That doesn't sound like a High Elf name."
"204987124-1-51405";"What do you mean, Tsoxolza is being persecuted?"
"204987124-1-51431";"What's the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-1-51460";"I visited Artaeum and met the Ritemaster."
"204987124-1-51472";"What can you tell me about Haladan, the murdered Sapiarch?"
"204987124-1-51475";"You must have some idea where they're sequestering the newcomers."
"204987124-1-51479";"Anything else I should know about this monastery?"
"204987124-1-51481";"And my reward?"
"204987124-1-51489";"Hopefully, so will my reward."
"204987124-1-51493";"I met Oriandra of the Psijic Order."
"204987124-1-51498";"Why didn't you bring an escort?"
"204987124-1-51504";"You mentioned the Direnni before. Who are they?"
"204987124-1-51508";"Why can't you talk to the Proxy Queen?"
"204987124-1-51510";"Tell me more about the war you're trying to end."
"204987124-1-51511";"Tell me more about the war you're trying to end."
"204987124-1-51512";"Tell me more about Courtier Vindilween."
"204987124-1-51518";"Why are these ingredients so special?"
"204987124-1-51530";"All right. I'll dump the shipments into the sea."
"204987124-1-51536";"I understand. Here are the goods, as promised."
"204987124-1-51541";"Who's Justiciar Rolumdel?"
"204987124-1-51545";"Tell me about Enigma."
"204987124-1-51547";"Tell me about Enigma."
"204987124-1-51558";"Who's Justiciar Rolumdel?"
"204987124-1-51571";"What will happen if I light the brazier?"
"204987124-1-51576";"It looks like there are Dwemer ruins here."
"204987124-1-51577";"What really happened here?"
"204987124-1-51579";"What will happen if I burn your body?"
"204987124-1-51587";"The Daedric Princes would have found a way, regardless of the Ritemaster's actions."
"204987124-1-51611";"Did you learn anything more about the pearl?"
"204987124-1-51617";"It might be better to leave the animals in the wild, where they belong."
"204987124-1-51631";"Can't you deputize the native High Elves?"
"204987124-1-51642";"How do you know your brother is here in Rellenthil?"
"204987124-1-51666";"What do you know about the temple?"
"204987124-1-51668";"I thought this language was ancient. How can you read it so easily?"
"204987124-1-51669";"I thought this language was ancient. How can you read it so easily?"
"204987124-1-51672";"Do you know what's wrong with the doors in this forest?"

"204987124-1-51685";"How's Erilthel holding up?"
"204987124-1-51686";"What exactly is this pearl?"
"204987124-1-51687";"What exactly is a pearl?"
"204987124-1-51688";"Tell me about Justiciar Avanaire."
"204987124-1-51692";"I met Cainar, Grog, and Miriya at the Eldbur Ruins."
"204987124-1-51695";"I thought you went off to hunt K'Tora."
"204987124-1-51696";"What do you mean that Grog is chained up as a gift to appease the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-1-51699";"There must be something you can tell me before we go."
"204987124-1-51708";"Tell me about the Queen's decree."
"204987124-1-51710";"What's that about the Kinlady and the nobles?"
"204987124-1-51711";"What's that about the Kinlady and the nobles?"
"204987124-1-51720";"What brings you to Summerset?"
"204987124-1-51724";"Anything else I should know about this monastery?"
"204987124-1-51726";"Are you sure you can win this duel?"
"204987124-1-51728";"Why did your marriage negotiations take decades?"
"204987124-1-51742";"After everything you did, this end is too good for you."
"204987124-1-51746";"Do you know anything else about the Sea Sload?"
"204987124-1-51747";"Why not send an army to deal with the Sea Sloads?"
"204987124-1-51748";"Do you know anything else about the Sea Sloads?"

"204987124-1-51788";"What are we looking for exactly? I don't know much about indriks."
"204987124-1-51789";"What makes this Eye of Remembrance so special?"
"204987124-1-51792";"Lorne mentioned that some aspects of this case remind her of your first encounter with the Ghost."
"204987124-1-51797";"So, who are you anyway?"
"204987124-1-51802";"What makes this Eye of Remembrance so special?"
"204987124-1-51806";"You said there are undead here?"
"204987124-1-51807";"I place the feather."
"204987124-1-51823";"I place the gemstone."
"204987124-1-51827";"I place the gemstone."
"204987124-1-51832";"Where is this place, exactly?"
"204987124-1-51845";"And just who is Telenger?"
"204987124-1-51863";"Can you tell me a little about this place?"

"204987124-1-51886";"Who are you exactly?"
"204987124-1-51888";"You really think I'm the right person for the job?"
"204987124-1-51895";"The Oracle is a wyress. How is she connected to the Psijic Order?"
"204987124-1-51897";"The Oracle mentioned Summerset and Artaeum. Can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-1-51898";"The Oracle mentioned Summerset and Artaeum. Can you tell me about them?"
"204987124-1-51909";"I helped Pavo remember who he was. Maybe that affected the book."
"204987124-1-51910";"I've been to Summerset and Artaeum."
"204987124-1-51924";"You seem a little uncomfortable with the Mages Guild's attention."
"204987124-1-51928";"What can you tell me about the keep we're infiltrating?"
"204987124-1-51934";"What can you tell me about the keep we're infiltrating?"
"204987124-1-51945";"Were you in command of the keep before it fell into the hands of the Maormer?"
"204987124-1-51953";"What do you mean, Tsoxolza is being persecuted?"
"204987124-1-51960";"What does it take to become a Psijic?"
"204987124-1-51969";"What is your role here in the Psijic Order, Celarus?"
"204987124-1-51980";"Why does your affair merit this much destruction?"

"204987124-1-55305";"Hit the ball into the hoops for one point. If it bounces off the wall first, you get three points."
"204987124-1-55314";"It's not junk, it's crafting materials. I have hobbies."
"204987124-1-55333";"While that's true, it's best not to go against your mentor's wishes."
"204987124-1-55343";"I agree. Keep up the good fight."
"204987124-1-55356";"What were you using the dragonthorn for?"
"204987124-1-55357";"You never suspected Ree-Nakal had bad intentions?"
"204987124-1-55371";"I'm going to speak with the others."
"204987124-1-55378";"Why me?"
"204987124-1-55383";"How are things back in Vivec City?"
"204987124-1-55384";"How are things back in Vivec City?"
"204987124-1-55385";"Why does Varona have an interest in ancient stonework?"
"204987124-1-55391";"Seasons? I don't have time for that."
"204987124-1-55392";"I'm not sure about that. Your apprentice looks pretty scared."
"204987124-1-55395";"What did I just witness?"
"204987124-1-55401";"So the Hist is guiding me too?"
"204987124-1-55403";"Have you seen Famia?"
"204987124-1-55404";"All right, I'll gather the frogs."
"204987124-1-55410";"How can you tell this is the Dominus Fatum?"
"204987124-1-55412";"Why does a Dark Elf ship have an Imperial name?"
"204987124-1-55419";"What's so important about this bonding ritual?"
"204987124-1-55421";"Take me to Daggerfall in the Covenant lands."
"204987124-1-55427";"Tell me about the Root-House people."
"204987124-1-55430";"What's special about Leviathan Pizzle?"
"204987124-1-55442";"I've never seen a swamp jelly before. What are they?"
"204987124-1-55443";"I'm sorry. I'm getting the jellies and you're doing what again?"
"204987124-1-55445";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55446";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55447";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55448";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55449";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55450";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55451";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55452";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-1-55453";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55454";"<Remain silent.>"
"204987124-1-55455";"Fine. I'll talk."
"204987124-1-55462";"How can I find one of these shortcuts?"
"204987124-1-55463";"Can we talk about what just happened in the Swallowed Grove?"
"204987124-1-55477";"We met before—in the dream-wallow, right?"
"204987124-1-55478";"We met before—in the dream-wallow, right?"
"204987124-1-55480";"I witnessed some of your argument earlier. Why were things so heated?"
"204987124-1-55484";"I'm interested in one of your Death-Hunts."
"204987124-1-55485";"I'm interested in one of your Death-Hunts."
"204987124-1-55487";"Tell me about Varo."
"204987124-1-55491";"I agree. No need to get caught up in a culture you don't belong to."
"204987124-1-55497";"Couldn't I guide the tribe? Why does it need to be Xukas or Jaxsik-Orrn?"
"204987124-1-55507";"I don't need a reminder."
"204987124-1-55517";"Yes, I think I do."
"204987124-1-55519";"Do you often give these stones to Famia?"
"204987124-1-55524";"Are your ancestors from Murkmire originally?"
"204987124-1-55546";"So, how'd it wind up here?"
"204987124-1-55547";"So, how'd it wind up out here?"
"204987124-1-55549";"How can you tell this is the Dominus Fatum?"
"204987124-1-55574";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-1-55575";"You were in Summerset. Had that Justiciar watching you like a hawk."
"204987124-1-55576";"Was it really a good idea to bring the cursed skull here?"
"204987124-1-55577";"What should I know about Famia?"
"204987124-1-55578";"What should I know about Famia?"
"204987124-1-55580";"Was it really a good idea to bring the cursed skull here?"
"204987124-1-55586";"I enjoy it."
"204987124-1-55593";"Hail Sithis, sister."
"204987124-1-55640";"Where did you get the Wrathstones?"
"204987124-1-55647";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-1-55655";"I need a moment to prepare."
"204987124-1-55657";"What's Wormroot Depths?"
"204987124-1-55708";"Why not talk to Abnur Tharn directly about destroying the weapon?"
"204987124-1-55710";"And who's the Mane?"
"204987124-1-55720";"How are you able to avoid Abnur Tharn's detection?"
"204987124-1-55726";"How are you able to avoid Abnur Tharn's detection?"
"204987124-1-55728";"Why not talk to Abnur Tharn directly about destroying the weapon?"
"204987124-1-55730";"If the weapon is as dangerous as Khamira says, maybe we should destroy it."
"204987124-1-55741";"Why is it called Baan Dar's Litter?"
"204987124-1-55743";"Why is it called Baan Dar's Litter?"
"204987124-1-55750";"Actions of the past? What do you mean?"
"204987124-1-55789";"Burr is your friend here?"
"204987124-1-55790";"And that makes you a Goblin expert?"
"204987124-1-55839";"This machine is huge. What do you think it was for?"
"204987124-1-55840";"This machine is huge. What do you think it was for?"
"204987124-1-55864";"What exactly is the Akaviri Potentate?"
"204987124-1-55877";"Can you tell me more about yourself?"
"204987124-1-55878";"I couldn't help but overhear your conversation earlier. Some sort of trouble?"
"204987124-1-55958";"Is that the other half of the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-1-55959";"Thunderboots? That does not seem like a typical Khajiiti name."
"204987124-1-55962";"What leads do you have?"
"204987124-1-55965";"Why do you need an assistant?"
"204987124-1-55966";"What leads do you have?"
"204987124-1-56027";"He deserves some sort of punishment."
"204987124-1-56029";"Next time, don't let him escape."
"204987124-1-56031";"Where did you get the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-1-56036";"Are you worried about Quintus coming after you again?"
"204987124-1-56037";"Tell me more about the Avernos."
"204987124-1-56068";"Who'd you say gave you the lute?"
"204987124-1-56088";"How about I buy it off you?"
"204987124-1-56099";"Is any of this going to interfere with the job?"
"204987124-1-56126";"All right, then let's get to it."
"204987124-1-56128";"<Turn your back.> Sheogorath, Sheogorath, Sheogorath."
"204987124-1-56141";"Tell me more about Zinthia."
"204987124-1-56174";"Hand over the lunch or I knot that mangy tail of yours around your neck."
"204987124-1-56189";"Then kill him, if that's what you want."
"204987124-1-56198";"Where is Torinaan?"
"204987124-1-56199";"Where are the Brothers of Strife?"
"204987124-1-56200";"Where is the Moonlit Maw?"
"204987124-1-56201";"Where is the Moonlit Maw?"
"204987124-1-56211";"Quite the interesting name you got there."
"204987124-1-56212";"I want to know more about our client, Ishu."
"204987124-1-56217";"Where can I find Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-1-56262";"I've crossed paths with an Orc necromancer. It might be the same person."
"204987124-1-56274";"Are you going to help me gather the mushrooms?"
"204987124-1-56275";"Are you going to help me gather the mushrooms?"
"204987124-1-56279";"I don't have any objections to necromancy."
"204987124-1-56373";"I want to know more about our client, Ishu."
"204987124-1-56386";"How could that artifact have helped them?"
"204987124-1-56398";"What happened to Quintus?"
"204987124-1-56438";"Is there a way I can get into the manor house?"
"204987124-1-56495";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-1-56497";"Tell me about yourself."
"204987124-1-56500";"What can you tell me about S'rendarr's Cradle?"
"204987124-1-56504";"Why do you feel you're safe among the Dead-Water tribe?"
"204987124-1-56506";"Why come to me for this? Don't the tribes have ways of dealing with this kind of crime?"
"204987124-1-56518";"Why is it forbidden?"
"204987124-1-56556";"Can you tell me more about your ranch?"
"204987124-1-56560";"Who's Khamira?"
"204987124-1-56561";"What do the Khajiiti stories have to do with a demon weapon?"
"204987124-1-56564";"What do the Khajiiti stories have to do with a demon weapon?"
"204987124-1-56566";"Is this whistle you want me to recover unique?"
"204987124-1-56568";"Who's Khamira?"
"204987124-1-56569";"Can you tell me more about your ranch?"
"204987124-1-56570";"Is this whistle you want me to recover unique?"
"204987124-1-56575";"Who's Sir Cadwell?"
"204987124-1-56577";"Who's Sir Cadwell?"
"204987124-1-56578";"Who are you?"
"204987124-1-56587";"I'd like to hear more about your grandfather's legacy."
"204987124-1-56590";"What are you, exactly?"
"204987124-1-56592";"Legends of Khunzar-ri?"
"204987124-1-56602";"You know that I'm a necromancer, right?"
"204987124-1-56606";"So you expect us to surrender?"
"204987124-1-56611";"The next death I deal is going to be yours!"
"204987124-1-56620";"You mentioned the Stricken came to S'rendarr's Cradle. What happened?"
"204987124-1-56624";"Did that sort of thing happen often in those days?"
"204987124-1-56625";"How can you call yourself a healer after leaving these people to die?"
"204987124-1-56629";"No."
"204987124-1-56630";"Were the Stricken the reason that you forbid Vazbi and the other adepts to come here?"
"204987124-1-56631";"Were they the reason that Vazbi and the adepts were forbidden from coming here?"
"204987124-1-56632";"Were they the reason that Vazbi and the adepts were forbidden from coming here?"
"204987124-1-56633";"How can you call yourself a healer after leaving these people to die?"
"204987124-1-56634";"Were they the reason that Vazbi and the adepts were forbidden from coming here?"
"204987124-1-56655";"I couldn't help but overhear your conversation earlier. Some sort of trouble?"
"204987124-1-56677";"You're right. Leave. You can't let this place or its failings define you."
"204987124-1-56692";"What can you tell me about the Dragonguard?"
"204987124-1-56693";"So Euraxia wasn't sent to conquer Rimmen?"
"204987124-1-56697";"I've seen it before. It belongs to Sheogorath."
"204987124-1-56708";"Where should I meet Captain Nala-do?"
"204987124-1-56709";"You said Zamarak might have been one of the King's Claws. What does that mean?"
"204987124-1-56710";"Not at all. You did plenty when you set the Dragons free."
"204987124-1-56716";"Let's skip the tour and get on with the parley."
"204987124-1-56751";"There's no need to play games with me. Mulaamnir admitted to your alliance when we spoke."
"204987124-1-56767";"It must be better than chasing down the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-1-56768";"Is the new Mane settling into the job?"
"204987124-1-56769";"Is the new Mane settling into the job?"
"204987124-1-56770";"Repear's March was certainly an adventure. Reminds me of our time chasing the Sweetroll Killer."
"204987124-1-56771";"What are you doing here, Raz?"
"204987124-1-56776";"When we faced Mannimarco and Molag Bal, you were stronger than this. What happened to you?"
"204987124-1-56778";"So you spend your time drinking and relaxing in this cave?"
"204987124-1-56781";"I've been to the Desert Wind Adeptorium. What else can you tell me about it?"
"204987124-1-56782";"You don't seem to get along with your family very well."
"204987124-1-56788";"Why were you living in a burial site?"
"204987124-1-56789";"Based on what we overheard, M'zum's workers are having problems."
"204987124-1-56790";"Based on what we overheard, M'zum's workers are having problems."
"204987124-1-56791";"What could they be afraid of?"
"204987124-1-56792";"Where do think this claw came from?"
"204987124-1-56793";"This claw I found is strange. Any idea what creature it might have come from?"
"204987124-1-56817";"Where do I find the loremaster?"
"204987124-1-56822";"Yes. They're both safe."
"204987124-1-56829";"Yes, they're both safe."
"204987124-1-56830";"They're both safe."
"204987124-1-56835";"What have you been doing since we last crossed paths?"
"204987124-1-56836";"What have you been doing since we last crossed paths?"
"204987124-1-56841";"There's no going back the way we came. Now what?"
"204987124-1-56842";"Is that the other half of the Wrathstone?"
"204987124-1-56843";"You think the voice we heard is responsible for the fall of the fort?"
"204987124-1-56844";"You think the voice we heard is responsible for the fall of the fort?"
"204987124-1-56854";"Too good to be true, it seems."
"204987124-1-56860";"Any ideas about what Naryu is up to lately?"
"204987124-1-56861";"Very well. Tell me more about the Akaviri Potentate."
"204987124-1-56879";"What more can you tell me?"
"204987124-1-56880";"You said <<1>> offers jobs that require multiple warriors?"
"204987124-1-56881";"Tell me about the jobs <<1>> offers."
"204987124-1-56884";"Who's Sereyne?"
"204987124-1-56890";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-1-56894";"I'll take my reward either way."
"204987124-1-56911";"What can you tell me about Azin-jo?"
"204987124-1-56920";"What can you tell me about Azin-jo?"
"204987124-1-56965";"Do you think you can find the missing half of the tablet?"
"204987124-1-56966";"Do you think you can find the missing half of the tablet?"
"204987124-1-56968";"Can you make out what's on the complete tablet?"
"204987124-1-56969";"Can you make out what's on the complete tablet?"
"204987124-1-56985";"Tell me more about the mural you were restoring."
"204987124-1-56987";"You said you already tried negotiating with the Goblins?"
"204987124-1-56994";"I'd like to know more about the Stitches before I go there."
"204987124-1-56995";"Tell me more about Nazdar."
"204987124-1-56996";"Tell me more about Nazdar."
"204987124-1-56997";"Who's Sereyne?"
"204987124-1-56999";"What's the Goiter's Gulp?"
"204987124-1-57003";"I wouldn't expect a Wood Elf to be an expert mechanist."
"204987124-1-57005";"I wouldn't expect a Bosmer to be an expert mechanist."
"204987124-1-57013";"Why were you locked up in that basement?"
"204987124-1-57045";"You said you already tried negotiating with the Goblins?"
"204987124-1-57061";"Let's go over your crew's roles."
"204987124-1-57062";"Sereyne."
"204987124-1-57064";"Who are all these people?"
"204987124-1-57065";"Tell me what Nazdar's part is."
"204987124-1-57066";"Tell me what Nazdar's part is."
"204987124-1-57067";"What's my part of the plan?"
"204987124-1-57068";"What's Sereyne's part of the plan?"
"204987124-1-57069";"Can you go over the plan, again?"
"204987124-1-57073";"Are you worried about Quintus coming after you again?"
"204987124-1-57121";"I thought you were against killing any guards."
"204987124-1-57122";"I thought you were against killing any guards."
"204987124-1-57157";"You swore to heal the sick, but instead you left them to die. What you did was murder."
"204987124-1-57167";"Who were you talking to when I arrived?"
"204987124-1-57171";"You also mentioned searching for your egg-mother's research notes?"
"204987124-1-57173";"I need more details about what happened to your companions."
"204987124-1-57176";"I see. So that's why you're creating an antidote."
"204987124-1-57177";"You also mentioned searching for your egg-mother's research notes?"
"204987124-1-57199";"Where did your friend, Zargha, go?"
"204987124-1-57205";"You said you're a priest of Two Moons. What is that?"
"204987124-1-57206";"Where did your friend, Zargha, go?"
"204987124-1-57237";"This fork sounds familiar. I think I may have encountered it before."
"204987124-1-57241";"I encountered an odd character after I rescued Zargha. I think he's responsible for this."
"204987124-1-57242";"You think this smell is going to lead me to the fork?"
"204987124-1-57243";"What have you been doing since we met in Summerset?"
"204987124-1-57244";"What have you been doing since we met in Summerset?"
"204987124-1-57270";"What makes Arum-Khal more dangerous than other liches?"
"204987124-1-57275";"Tell me more about Peryite."
"204987124-1-57283";"Tell me about the Moon-Bishop."
"204987124-1-57285";"What are the Sands Behind the Stars?"
"204987124-1-57289";"What are you going to do with the fork I brought you?"
"204987124-1-57290";"Tell me about the Moon-Bishop."
"204987124-1-57292";"Only fools follow Peryite."
"204987124-1-57300";"Can you tell me more about Predator Mesa?"
"204987124-1-57305";"Can you tell me more about Predator Mesa?"
"204987124-1-57313";"Tell me about these hunters I'm hunting."
"204987124-1-57331";"What can you tell me about Nisaazda?"

"204987124-1-59733";"The skin of Khenarthi's fallen children."
"204987124-1-59740";"How do you know this Yahgrondu will help us?"
"204987124-1-59742";"You haven't spoken to anyone? Not even Lyris?"

"204987124-1-59989";"You said Nahfahlaar is acting strangely. How, exactly?"
"204987124-1-59990";"Remind me. How do you know Abnur Tharn?"

"204987124-1-60098";"What was that you mentioned about focal points?"
"204987124-1-60103";"Zhasim was worried about you, too."

"204987124-1-60182";"Do the Senchal Khajiit welcome you, being a Dark Elf and all?"
"204987124-1-60185";"I have found the Khajiit to be wary, but willing to work with a Dark Elf. Have you found the same?"
"204987124-1-60196";"You don't have to accept. You did your duty. You can return to Cyrodiil with your head held high."
"204987124-1-60208";"The mask I found is suppose to give me the power of Alkosh, but it hasn't done anything."
"204987124-1-60226";"Good luck working it out."
"204987124-1-60228";"Good luck sorting it out."
"204987124-1-60291";"How did you get into this line of work?"

"204987124-1-60309";"Well, it's not like this is our first time fighting against the forces of evil."
"204987124-1-60314";"I know how to use a grappling bow. It came in handy when we were searching for the Horn of Ja'darri."
"204987124-1-60330";"I want to know more about you."
"204987124-1-60337";"I was once empowered by the Amulet of Kings. Is the Mask of Alkosh similar to that amulet?"

"204987124-1-60472";"You said your guard chased after the thieves?"
"204987124-1-60474";"I want to know more about the Order of the New Moon."
"204987124-1-60476";"So, do you know anything at all about this exhibition you mentioned?"
"204987124-1-60486";"How did you manage to corral all these terror birds?"
"204987124-1-60507";"That's a short list."
"204987124-1-60513";"I'm ready to go. (Fast Travel to the Meeting Place)"
"204987124-1-60518";"I'm ready to go. (Fast Travel to the Meeting Place)"

"204987124-1-60531";"What have you been up to since we defeated Molag Bal?"
"204987124-1-60534";"What should we expect the medallion to do?"
"204987124-1-60536";"I'm ready to go to the meeting place now."
"204987124-1-60538";"I'm ready to go to the meeting place now."
"204987124-1-60541";"How are you alive? I watched you sacrifice yourself to empower the Amulet of Kings!"
"204987124-1-60566";"I witnessed an Adept of the Hidden Moon redeem a dro-m'Athra in the Ashen Scar."

"204987124-1-60658";"All of the exhumed corpses were the same gender."
"204987124-1-60661";"They were all buried in this graveyard."
"204987124-1-60664";"We got a sample of the refined netherroot brew. Lyris is bringing it to the Blue Palace."
"204987124-1-60673";"Tell me more about these dreams. Are they always the same?"
"204987124-1-60677";"Your mother would be proud of you, no matter what happens."
"204987124-1-60693";"We absconded with plans from Blackreach. Svana is taking them to the Blue Palace."

"204987124-1-60774";"You said Nahfahlaar is acting strangely. How, exactly?"
"204987124-1-60787";"How is your daughter doing?"
"204987124-1-60811";"No, I don't think I could."
"204987124-1-60823";"Go ahead. I'll meet you in Windhelm. (Do Not Fast Travel)"
"204987124-1-60856";"I've been inside Greymoor Keep. It's not impregnable."

"204987124-1-60949";"How did you get free?"
"204987124-1-60976";"Give Svana some credit, Maugh. Are you trying to protect her or just hold her back?"
"204987124-1-60982";"A jewel of blue rules the view."
"204987124-1-60991";"I'm a creature like him—a vampire. We're not all evil."
"204987124-1-60993";"I know the feeling. I'm a vampire too."
"204987124-1-60996";"You mentioned Draugrkin? Who are they?"
"204987124-1-60997";"I'm sure it will look good in your collection."

"204987124-1-61121";"No one was able to stop the assassin. You did what you could."
"204987124-1-61197";"No, he got away."
"204987124-1-61216";"His guilt lies in trusting a woman who confided her wicked intentions to him."
"204987124-1-61231";"We won't know until we find out what he wants."
"204987124-1-61253";"Do you think Eastern and Western Skyrim might reconcile?"

"204987124-1-61281";"I also came here to warn you about the Icereach Coven. They're definitely at work in the area."

"204987124-1-61326";"Do you want to make someone else test the elixir?"
"204987124-1-61335";"Who is this ally the witch was talking about?"

"204987124-1-61421";"What is the Shadowgreen?"
"204987124-1-61422";"Who hired you?"
"204987124-1-61423";"A soldier accused me of being a spy. Are your people always so suspicious?"
"204987124-1-61424";"Why is there bad blood between High King Svargrim and Jorunn the Skald-King?"
"204987124-1-61426";"How do we know the smugglers and Reachmen are even connected?"
"204987124-1-61437";"Why can't you go to the auction yourself?"
"204987124-1-61475";"I want to know more about this arrangement first."
